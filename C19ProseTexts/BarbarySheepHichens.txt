BARBARY SHEEP 



i 



SIR CLAUDE WYVERNE was a 
simple and rather heavy young 
Englishman, who had married a very 
frivolous wife, and who adored her. 
Adoration leads to abnegation, and 
Sir Claude, as soon as he was a mar- 

\ried man, began to give way to Lady 
Wyverne. She was a very pretty 
and changeable blonde. Any perma- 
nence seemed to her dull; and this 
^ trait secretly agitated her husband, 
^-.who desired to be permanent in her 
life and not to be thought dull by 
her. In order to achieve this result, 
==Jie decided to present himself as often 




as possible to Lady Wyverne in the 
seductive guise of change-giver. He 
was perpetually occupied in devising 
novelties to keep up her butterfly 
spirits and in anticipating her every 
whim. 

One spring, just as Sir Claude 
thought they were going at last to 
settle down in a pretty country place 
they had in Leicestershire, Lady 
Wyverne expressed a sudden wish to 
"run over" to Algiers. 

"Caroline Barchester and her bear 
[have gone there, Crumpet," she said. 
'Let's go, too. I'll get an introduc- 
tion to the ex-Queen of Madagascar 
[and the Prince of Annam they're 
| in exile there, you know and we'll 
,have some fun and see something 
;new. I'm tired of ordinary people, 
i Let's start on Tuesday. We'll stay 
in Paris en route." 

Of course Sir Claude assented. 
They started for Algiers on the 



Tuesday, and they stayed in Paris 
en route. 

While they were in Paris they went, 
against Sir Claude's will, to visit a 
famous astrologer called Dr. Melie 
Etoile, about whom everybody 
Lady Wyverne's everybody hap- 
pened to be raving at that moment. 
Lady Wyverne went into this worthy's 
presence first, leaving her husband 
looking unusually English even for 
him seated in the waiting-room, a 
small chamber all cane chairs, arti- 
ficial flowers, and signs of the zo- 
diac, heated by steam, and carefully 
shrouded, at the tiny windows, by 
bead blinds. 

After perhaps half an hour Lady 
Wyverne came out in a state of 
violent excitement. 

"He's extraordinary!" she ex- 
claimed. "He's a genius! A little 
bearded thing like a mouse, who 
Go in, Crumpet!" 




But Sir Claude protested. He had 
only come to bring his wife. He him- 
self was an absolute sceptic in matters 
occult, and indeed thought almost 
everything at all out of the way 
"damned silly." The idea of sub- 
mitting himself to an astrologer call- 
ed "Melie" roused all his British an- 
tagonism. But Lady Wyverne was 
firm. Indeed, her caprices generally 
had a good deal of cast-iron in them. 
In rather less than three minutes, 
therefore, Sir Claude was sitting at 
a tiny table opposite to a small old 
man with a white beard and pink 
eyes, and answering questions about 
the hour of night when he was born, 
the date of the year, his illnesses, and 
various other small matters till then 
regarded by him as strictly private. 
Eventually he came out, holding a 
folded paper in his hand, and looking 
fa good deal like a well-bred poker. 
"Silly rot!" he muttered, as he en- 






tered the outer room where his wife 
was awaiting him among the signs 
of the zodiac and the waxen peo- 
nies. 

"What's silly rot?" cried Lady 
Wyverne. 

"What that chap says." 

"What does he say?" 

"Oh, a lot of rot. I s'pose he 
thought I couldn't understand him, 
or he wanted an extra guinea. Any- 
how he's written it all down here." 

He held out the paper, which his 
wife eagerly seized. After glancing 
lover the red and purple writing on it, 
she exclaimed: 

!! "Mars! That's this month. This 
is March the first." 

"I know. Rot, isn't it?" 

"Mars," continued Lady Wyverne, 
reading aloud, "periode de luttes, de 
contestations, d'anxiete, et meme de 
r peines de coeur. Eviter de partir en 
voyage la nuit. Danger d'une " 
s 






She stopped. Her childish, oval 
face was unusually grave. 

"Rot, isn't it?" said Sir Claude, 
gazing at his wife with anxiety in his 
eyes. 



II 



THE ex-Queen of Madagascar was 
very gracious in her villa on 
the hill above Algiers. The Prince 
of Annam showed Sir Claude his 
horses, at which Sir Claude scarcely 
looked, as he was thoroughly pre- 
occupied by the little bag in which 
his agreeable host confined his lux- 
uriant crop of black hair. Caroline 
Barchester and her bear, who was 
also her husband, had plenty of gos- 
sip to tell the Wyvernes in the pret-/ 
ty garden of the Hotel St. Georges' 
at Mustapha. Yet by March ioth/ . 
Lady Wyverne had had enough 
Algiers. 

"Let's get on, Crumpet," she said. 






to her husband. "We've seen the' 
-3 Queen and the Moorish Bath c 
^ least you've seen it and the Gov-j 
'-* ernor's Palace and Cap Matifou and* 
all the rest of it. So let's get on tow- 
ards the desert." 

Sir Claude looked unusually grim 
and mulish. 

"I didn't know we were going to 
the desert," he said. 

"Why, of course. What did we 
come for?" 

"To see Algiers, I thought." 

" Nonsense ! Algiers is as French as 
the Rue de la Paix. I want to know 
all about camels and sand-dunes and 
Ouled what are they? Get two 
berths in the sleeping-car for El- 
Akbara; there's a dear. It's at the 
gate of the desert, you know. We'll 
stay the night and then trot on to 
Beni-Mora." 

Then, as he still looked mulish, she 
added, mischievously: 



" Or I shall thinkyou're silly enough 
to believe in Melie Etoile's prophecy." 
"Rot!" said Sir Claude. "A fel- 
low like a white 

"Very well, then, get the tickets!" 
He went at once to Cook's and 
got the tickets, but he looked very 
grave, almost distressed, as he re- 
turned to the hotel. And all that 
evening he scarcely took his eyes 
from his wife's pretty, rather doll- 
like, face. 

"I believe you do believe!" she 

said to him, as they were going up to 

bed. "'Danger d'une grande perte' 

W that was what he wrote 'la plus 

\ grande perte possible.' What would 

fR be the greatest loss possible to you?" 

^ "You ought to know," he replied, 

gs= almost harshly. 

^-, And he caught her little hand and 
wrung it. 

"Oh, Crumpet, my rings!" she 
cried. 




But she left her hand in his, and 
added, on the landing: 

"As if you could lose me out here! 
Crumpet, you're more foolish than I 
am, and I'm one mass of superstition, 
even about going under ladders." 

"Then do you believe that pink- 
eyed astrologer chap?" 

"Of course not. Bed, bed, beau- 
tiful bed!" 

In the evening of the next day they 
arrived at El-Akbara, but not with- 
,out a little adventure on the way. 
Near a station called Kreir the train 
ran off the line, and Lady Wyverne, 
though not hurt, was a good deal 
i shaken and very much frightened. 
i When, after a long delay, they started 
.again, both she and her husband sat 
: opposite to each other in a moody si- 
; lence. Sir Claude seemed specially op- 
pressed, and smoked cigar after cigar 
with almost feverish rapidity. Only 
when they had left the train and were 



being driven to the little inn, where 
they were to spend the night, did they 
both brighten and begin to return to 
their normal spirits. 

" What an extraordinary little place, 
Crumpet!" said Lady Wyverne, peer- 
ing through her veil at the towering 
rocks which formed a terrific wall, 
dividing the desert from the Tell. 
"But where 's the Sahara?" 

"I dunno, Kitty," returned Sir 
Claude. "Wonder if there's any 
shoo tin' in those mountains." 

"Why, it's getting quite cold!" 
cried Lady Wyverne, as the carriage 
rattled into a narrow gorge of the rocks 
full of shadows and of the sound of 
rushing waters. "One would never 
suppose that the desert Here's the 
hotel!" 

The carriage had stopped before a 
solitary house which stood in the \ 
heart of the gorge on the edge of a ^ 
turmoil of absinthe - colored water. 




Stupendous battlements of rock rear- 
ed themselves up round about it 
towards the clear blue sky. In front 
of it grew a line of Judas-trees along 
the white road, which is the caravan 
route from the Tell to the Sahara. 
It was small, low, but clean and in- 
viting-looking, with a wide veranda 
and French windows with green shut- 
ters. 

"Tea on the veranda!" cried Lady 
Wyverne. "Tea tea and then 
where's the desert?" 

The landlady, a plump and pleas- 
ant Frenchwoman of middle-age and 
motherly appearance, explained that 
it lay immediately beyond the wall 
of rock. Five minutes' walk through 
the gorge and " Madame " would be 
there. Lady Wyverne was all ex- 
citement. She quite forgot her shak- 
!(ing and fright, and as soon as she 
Ifhad swallowed a cup of tea she made 
her husband accompany her down 






the road towards the natural portal 
which the Arabs call "The Gate of 
the Sahara." He had been below, 
conferring with a tall Arab guide, 
who now walked beside them need- 
lessly to show the way, and he said 
to his wife, with considerable anima- 
tion: 

"I say, Kitty, what d' you think? 
This chap says there's splendid sport 
here, any amount of Barbary sheep 
up in those rocks, and herds of gazelle 
in the plain just beyond. D' you 
think you'd mind spendin' a couple 
o' nights here instead of one? I 
could get up to-morrow at three 
o'clock and be off to get a shot at 
somethin'. What d' you think?" 

He looked at her anxiously. 

"I'll tell you in a minute, Crumpet, 
when I've Oh!" 

She uttered a little cry and stood 
still, clutching her husband's arm. 
They had come out into the desert 
13 






and were facing the sunset. Abrupt 
ly the world had changed. A glory 
of color dazzled their eyes. The riv- 
er, now flowing quietly, wound away 
into the bosom of an oasis of magnifi- 
cent palm-trees that lay in a meas- 
ureless expanse of pale-yellow earth 
covered with scattered crystals. To 
the left stretched a distant mountain 
range, dim purple beneath the rose of 
the sunset. And from three Arab 
villages of brown houses scattered 
among the palms came the cries of 
children, the barking of dogs, and the 
faint sounds of African drums and 
hautboys. 

Under a great rock by the river- 
side sat an Arab boy piping a tune 
that was like caprice personified in 
music. 

"Oh, Crumpet!" said Lady Wy- 
verne, after a little pause of contem- 
plation, "how strange it is and how 
how" 



She caught her breath. There 
were tears in her eyes. 

"Camels! Camels!" she cried. 
"Look, Crumpet!" 

A caravan was winding out of the 
gorge, a train of laden camels, and 
barefooted, dark -faced men in flut- 
tering, ragged garments. 

"Doosid picturesque," assented Sir 
Claude. " To get a shot at the sheep 
you have to 

"Yes, yes, I know." 

"Well, but how can you " 

" I tell you I know I know. We'll 
stay two nights. Go off to-morrow 
at three and kill whatever you like. 
Only let me stay and explore those 
villages and wander among those / 
palms." 

"You can't go alone." 

"I '11 take a guide." 

" I'll find out at the hotel if there's' 
one that's all right," muttered Sir* 
Claude. "This fellow always goes|| 

IS 






with the sportsmen. I say 
I'm feelin' awful hungry." 
~ "You mundane thing!" said Lady 
*. Wyverne, shrugging her shoulders. 

But she turned back and they made 
their way to the inn, which was now 
shrouded in the deep shadows of the 
rapidly approaching night. 

At dinner the only other person 
in the room was a very smart and 
handsome young Arab, who, the wait- 
er told them, was an officer in the 
Spahis, and was stationed at Algiers, 
but who was now on leave and going 
to the home of his father, an impor- 
tant Caid. in the Zibans district. Lady 
Wyverne looked at the guest with 
interest. He wore a snowy turban 
and a red jacket, and between the 
white and red his magnificent black 
eyes sparkled impudently, and his 
teeth gleamed as he smiled at the 
waiter, to whom he addressed a few 
words in excellent French. His face 

16 



was extraordinarily expressive, brill- 
iant, but cruel and startlingly intel- 
ligent. 

All through dinner Sir Claude was 
talking about Barbary sheep, and 
directly dinner was over he said: 

"I say, Kitty, s'pose we turn in." 

"Turn in!" said Lady Wyverne. 
"Why, it's only eight o'clockl" 

"I know, but you're awfully done 
up, with that accident and all, and " 

" You mean that you're sleepy and 
that you've got to be up at three to 
kill some wretched sheep. Go to bed, 
Crumpet ; but I'm going to stay out on 
the veranda and look at the moon." 

Sir Claude cast a drowsy glance 
towards the young Spahi, who had 
, just picked up a walnut out of a fruit- 
jg=_ dish and was holding it delicately in 
""-. his slim, almost womanish fingers. 
The Spahi looked demurely down. 

"Well, Kitty, I think I will turn 
L in. You see, if I don't get enough 





sleep, there's no knowin' to-morrow 
whether 

"You'll hit the wretched sheep or 
pot your guide. I know. Trot 
along." 

Sir Claude turned to trot. A sharp 
little sound rang through the room. 
He looked round. The Spahi had 
cracked the nut with his fingers, and 
was smiling gently as he tenderly ex- 
tracted the kernel. 

" I dunno that I am ready for bed," 
began Sir Claude. "P'r'aps I'll have 
a smoke first on 

"No, no; the bolster calls you. I 
know by the lobster look in your dear 
old eyes. Come along, Crumpet!" 

She vanished from the room follow- 
ed by her husband. 

The Spahi looked after them, got 
up, lit a cigarette, and strolled out 
f> into the little paved enclosure above 
fa which the veranda projected. He 
^ leaned his shoulder against a pillar 







and stood there motionless, staring 
towards the Judas-trees and the white 
road that wound away among the 
shadows of the gorge towards the 
desert. 




in 




SIR CLAUDE went to bed, of 
course. He always did what 
his wife told him to do. Lady 
Wyverne tucked him up, and then, 
followed by the familiar sound of 
his first snore, went out onto the 
veranda beneath which the young 
Spahi was standing. He heard the 
rustle of her gown above him in the 
still night, and smiled. Brilliant 
stars sparkled in the sky, and the 
thread of road that wound through 
the gorge to the Sahara was lit up 
by a round, white moon. In the 
tel the landlady, her family, and 
the servants were supping cheer- 
fully. Nobody was about. After a 




minute the Spahi moved away from 
the pillar against which he had been 
leaning, to the wooden railing be- 
neath the Judas-trees, which divided 
the small, paved court-yard of the inn 
from the road. He turned and stood 
with his back against it, facing the 
veranda, but he did not look up. 
Standing there motionless, he ap- 
peared to be wrapped in a profound 
reverie. Lady Wyverne watched 
him curiously. His large, white tur- 
ban looked ghostly in the moonlight, 
she thought. Why did he stand 
there motionless? Of what could he 
be thinking? This place, so unlike 
any place she had ever before seen, 
puzzled her. This motionless man 
puzzled her, too. The frivolity of 
her spirit was led captive by this 
African solitude in the night, on the 
edge of a greater solitude, the vast 
and unknown desert in which this 
man who stood like a statue beneath 






had been born and bred, to which 
he was now returning. A sensation 
almost of awe crept over her, and she 
began to wonder. When a woman 
begins to wonder there is no limit 
to her mental journeyings. Lady 
Wyverne had travelled very far when 
a strange sound startled her and 
arrested her attention. 

It was a voice singing, or rather 
murmuring, an uncouth tune, a soft, 
whining, almost babyish voice. From 
i whom did it come? 

She could see no one except the 
young Spahi, and it did not occur 
to her at first that the voice could 
proceed from a man's mouth. She 
listened, leaning over the balustrade. 
The voice went on singing until it 
seemed to her as if it had become one 
with the night, almost as if it were 
the voice of the night in this rocky 
solitude at the edge of the sands. 
^ The tune was ugly, she thought, but 

' 



it interested her. Had she spoken 
of it, she would probably have said 
that it was "so weird." She had 
never before heard anything at all 
resembling it. By degrees the sing- 
ing began to affect her almost pain- 
fully, to play upon her nerves, to 
make her restless and uneasy. She 
took her arms from the rail of the 
veranda. Who was the singer ? She 
tried to locate the sound, and pres- 
ently it seemed to her that it came 
from the spot where the Spahi was 
standing. Was it really he who was 
singing ? Was it a a serenade ? 

She smiled. Her swift vanity was 
awake. When she moved the Spahi 
moved too. He walked softly across 
the little court, lifted his head towards / 
the veranda and showed Lady Wy verne /; 
his dark face with the lips moving./ 
He was the singer, and now, almost/^ 
insolently, he sent the song to her. 

Ever since she had "come out"$% 






Lady Wyverne had been accustomed 
to admiration, even to worship such } 
worship as modern smart men have'. 
', at their command to give to a pretty ? 
woman. But this strange, whining 
serenade from an African was a new 
experience. The boldness of the dark 
face turned upward to her in the 
moonlight, and the babyish sound of 
the voice that issued from its lips, 
formed a combination that stirred 
her neurotic temperament ever im- 
patient in the search after novelty. 
Almost ere she realized what she was 
doing, she had smiled at the Spahi. 
He stopped singing and smiled up at 
her. Then he spoke, as if to speak 
with her were the most natural thing 
in the world. 

" Has madame ever seen the desert 
under the moon?" 

Lady Wyverne started and half 
drew back. This really was carrying 
things very far. 




"Madame is coming down?" said 
the Spahi, misinterpreting the move- 
ment with a delightful, boyish inso- 
lence. 

Before she knew that she was 
speaking, Lady Wyverne had said, 
in French: 

"Certainly not." 

"It is a pity. Five minutes and 
madame could see the desert in the 
moonlight. There is nothing to 
fear." 

He put his hand down for an in- 
stant, then lifted it, and Lady Wyv- 
erne saw the moonlight glittering on 
the polished steel of a revolver. The 
sparkle fascinated her eyes more than 
the sparkle of the stars. 

"I'm not afraid," she said. 

This time she spoke deliberately. 
The imp, caprice, by which she was 
always governed, whispered to her: 

"This is a new bit of fun! Don't 
be such a fool as to avoid it." 








" But madame does not care to see 
the desert?" 

At this moment he noticed that 
Lady Wyverne's blue eyes had trav- 
elled away from his face and were 
gazing at something behind him. He 
turned, and saw a train of camels and 
nomads stealing by the inn on their 
way to the desert. Noiselessly they 
padded on the narrow thread of road. 
The nomads were muffled in ragged 
hoods and fluttering cloaks, and 
carried clubs. With their birdlike 
eyes staring before them, they passed 
like phantoms into the shadows of the 
gorge. Their appearance and disap- 
pearance woke up in Lady Wyverne 
a vague sense of romance and mys- 
tery, a longing to follow these strange 
men and their beasts into the silver 
world which lay beyond the shadows. 

She slipped across the veranda and 
peeped into Sir Claude's room. He 
was snoring bravely. 




" Dreaming of Barbary sheep !" 
murmured Lady Wyverne. " If only 
Crumpet were a little bit more 
h'm!" 

She sighed, caught up a cloak, and 
went softly down-stairs. 

The Spahi met her in the court- 
yard. The impudence of his de- 
meanor had vanished, and he bowed 
with a ceremonious gravity which 
surprised Lady Wyverne, who was 
unaccustomed to the rapid and com- 
plete changes of manner so common 
among Orientals. 

"Will not monsieur come, too ?" he 
asked, simply. 

"Monsieur!" 

Lady Wyverne looked into his great 
eyes with a staring amazement. 

"Monsieur is asleep," she added, 
recovering herself. 

"So early!" 

There was the least hint of sar- .',] 
casm in his voice. 

27 





"He is going after Barbary sheep 
to-morrow morning at three o'clock," 
said Lady Wyverne, rather sharply. 

The Spahi looked steadily into her 
pretty, blond face. 

"Barbary sheep!" he repeated. 
"Barbary sheep!" 

There was a note of pity in his 
voice. 

" May I put madame's cloak round 
her?" he added, after a pause. 

" I I'm not going out," said Lady 
Wyverne. 

" But the cloak ?" he said, gravely. 

And he took it from her hands and, 
swiftly and gracefully, with an ex- 
traordinary deftness, put it round 
her. 

"Come, madame!" 

"But" 

He opened the gate. 

"It is only five minutes. In a 
Iquarter of an hour we are here and 

madame has seen ah, a thing more 
28 




wonderful than she has ever seen 
England." 

He held the gate open. Lady 
Wyverne stepped out into the road. 





Next morning at three o'clock, 
when the stars were still shining, 
jLady Wyverne heard her husband 
moving about heavily in his room. 
Presently he came to her door, opened 
it with elaborate caution, and passed 
in, holding a candle in his hand. A 
gun was slung over his shoulder. She 
lay still, with her eyes shut, and after 
a moment he shut the door and she 
heard him tramp down the stairs. 
His footsteps died away. Then she 
heard outside a faint sound of voices, 
the clatter of mules. He was gone. 
She sighed. She was asking her- 
self why she had feigned sleep. 
But she did not answer her own 
question. 

"I hope he'll have luck," she 





thought. " I do hope he'll kill some 
thing." 

And then she really slept. 

In the afternoon at five o'clock 
Sir Claude rode up to the inn door 
in wild spirits. Behind him, slung 
across a mule, was a dead Barbary 
sheep. 

"Grand sport!" he exclaimed, look- 
ing up at his wife, who was on the 
veranda sitting on a straw chair. " I 
waited for hours to get a shot, and 
I say, Kit, you haven't been borin' 
yourself to death?" 

"No, Crumpet." 

"Jolly little place, isn't it? I 
shouldn't mind spendin' a week here." 

"Very well," she answered. 

"You don't mind?" he exclaimed. 

"I'll do just as you like." 

"You are a brick, Kitty! You 
see, there's gazelle in the plain, too, 
and" 

"I know, I know." 
30 



He pounded up the stairs to kiss 
her. 

"Poor old Crumpet!" she thought. 

And she felt as if she were being 
kissed by a small school-boy. 

That evening at dinner they were 
alone. 

"The Spahi chap's gone?" asked 
Sir Claude, with an indifferent and 
sleepy glance round. 

" I don't think so. I saw him about 
to-day. Perhaps he's got friends in 
the village and is eating a cous-cous 
with them." 

"A what?" 

"A cous-cous a stew rice, or 
something, and mutton and spices." 

"Jove, Kitty, you are up in all this 
Arab rot! How the deuce do you^ 
pick up such a lot of information// / 
about it?" n 

"There is a book called Murray" (fljfj$/( : 
she answered, dryly. "Do you 
to bed at eight to-night?" 





"Well, I'm pretty well done up. 
You see, startin' off at three again to- 
^ morrow. You were sleepin' like a 
j top last night when I looked in." 

"Ah," she said. "Now I know 
5.. how tops sleep." 

"What d' you mean?" 
"Nothing. Go to bed, old boy." 
Without much persuasion he obey- 
ed the command. Barbary sheep 
had made him very tired. He could 
almost have slept standing like a 
horse that night. 



IV 



" \ \ 7 AS the cous-cous good 1" asked 
V V Lady Wyverne, half an hour 
later. 

She and the Spahi were walking 
together slowly down the moonlit 
road between the towering rocks of 
the gorge, whose fantastic silhouettes, 
black beneath the deep-purple sky of 
night, looked like the silhouettes of 
the rocks in one of Dore's pictures of 
the Inferno. The noise of the rush- 
ling waters of the river was in their 
ears and almost drowned the murmur 
of their voices as they spoke to each 
other. 

"I could not eat, madame." 
j "Why not?" 





"I was thinking of your departure 
to-morrow, and of mine far into the 
Zibans, to the house of my father." 

"Absurd!" she said, with a little 
shrug of her shoulders. "I had an 
excellent appetite." 

He was silent. To-night he wore 
over his shoulders a great red cloak, 
which swung gently to and fro as 
he walked on with the magnificent 
dignity and pride which is the birth- 
right of the Arab race. She glanced 
at him sideways, with a birdlike turn 
of her little head. 

"Besides," she added, "I'm not 
going away to-morrow." 

His eyes flashed on her like fire. 

"Madame?" 

"No, we stay some days more. 
^Barbary sheep, you know!" And 
gshe laughed, but rather mirthlessly. 

" Will you have to ride from Beni- 
Mora?" she added. "The railway 
ends there, doesn't it?" 



" Yes, madame. From there I shall 
ride." 

"How many days?" 

"Three days." 

"And always in the desert?" 

"Always in the desert." 

"And then you will reach your 
home. How strange!" 

She was thinking of Chester Street, 
Belgrave Square, in which she had 
first seen the light. What a gulf 
was fixed between her and this man 
with whom she was now adventurous- 
ly walking through this savage soli- 
tude! And yet his cloak, as it swung, 
touched the skirt of her gown, and 
she could see the fire sparkling in his 
eyes as he bent his head down when 
she spoke to him. And she she had 
a capricious desire to find some bridge 
across this gulf, to venture upon it, 
to bring Chester Street to the Zibans. 
She was not stupid, and, being a 
woman, she was intuitive, and so it 

35 





never occurred to her even for a mo- 
ment that the Zibans could ever be 
brought to Chester Street. 

The sound of the river sank to a 
softer note as its bed widened out, 
leaving space for the released waters 
to flow quietly towards the palm- 
trees of the first oasis. Through the 
great natural aperture in the wall of 
rock a vague vision of glimmering 
spaces showed itself, like a mirage of 
eternity washed with silver. Lady 
Wyverne stood still. 

"No farther," she said. "This 
was where we stopped last night." 

"One step farther to-night, ma- 
dame!" said the Spahi. "One little 
step." 

"No, no." 

He pointed with his hand out- 
stretched and the red folds of his 
jcloak flowing down from his arm. 

"But it calls us." 

"What?" 

36 





"The desert, madame. Listen!" 

Lady Wyverne looked at him. He 
had spoken with so much authority 
that she did not smile at his remark 
or think it ridiculous. She even 
listened, like one in expectation of 
r some distant sound, some voice from 
the far away that lay beyond the 
spaces her eyes could see. But in 
the deep silence of the night she heard 
only the murmur of the river flowing 
into the moving shadows of the palms. 

"There's no voice," she said, at 
last. 

"There is a voice for me," he an- 
swered. "But I am a son of the 
desert." 
| "Do you love it?" 

" I belong to it. It has no secrets 
from me. I have learned all its les- 
sons." 

"Could I learn them?" 
| She spoke with a sort of modesty 
very unusual in her. 

37 






IW 



" Only with one who belongs to the 
desert." 

"Then I shall never learn them," 
she said, with a sort of half-childish 
regret. 

"Why not?" 

" Why not ? What an absurd ques- 
tion!" 

"One can learn what one chooses 
to learn. I" he spoke proudly 
"I have learned to be a French 
officer." 

"I really don't feel equal to learn- 
ing to be an Arab woman," she re- 
joined, rather petulantly. "Besides, 
you know as well as I do that men 
can do a thousand things women 
can't do." 

"Even a woman can go a step 
farther, "he said. 

"Oh well that's not very im- 
portant. I don't mind." 

And she walked on. 

He smiled as he followed her. 
38 



When they came out of the gorge 
they were in the full flood of the 
moonlight. The change from the 
confined space of the gorge to this 
immensity of the desert was startling, 
and a sudden sense of loneliness and 
danger rushed upon Lady Wyverne. 
Abruptly she realized that this caprice 
of hers, besides being extremely un- 
conventional, might be something 
more. She thought of "Crumpet" 
snoring peacefully in the hotel, and 
for the first time wished that she 
had not left his side. The Spahi, 
watching her face in the bright 
moonlight, read with the swift cer- 
tainty of the Arab, always horribly 
acute in summing up the character / 
and flying thoughts of the European, 
all that was passing in her mind and 
answered it in a sentence. 

"She who loves the strange must' 
not fear to face it," he said, quietly. 

Lady Wyverne reddened. She was i 



( 









^ ^__. made half angry by his intelligence^ 
;|J, and his assurance. Nevertheless, they } 

fascinated her. She was accustomed ; 

* 

i* to understand men much more thor- ' 
oughly than they understood her. 
This man put her down from her seat 
of the mighty and calmly sank into 
it himself. He puzzled her immense- 
ly, but she felt certain that she did 
not puzzle him at all. 

" I am not afraid of anything," she 
said. "You don't understand me." 

She stopped in the road. 

" One may choose not to do a thing 
without being afraid of doing it." 

" But if it is a thing one longs to 
do, madame?" 

He moved on a step, then looked 
back at Lady Wyverne as if sum- 
moning her. She stood firm, and he 
stopped with serene resignation. 

"What on earth are we talking 
about?" she said, shrugging her little 
shoulders perversely. 



"Your step farther." 

"I have taken it. And now I'm 
going back." 

"And to-morrow?" 

"To-morrow you will not be 
here." 

"But if I, too, should be tempt- 
ed to remain? Barbary sheep, you 
know, madame, Barbary sheep!" 

He laughed softly. 

"To-morrow I shall go to bed at 
half -past eight," replied Lady Wyv- 
erne, with an air of virtue that was 
too violent to be quite convincing. 
"The atmosphere of the desert tires 
me." 

"And to me it gives life." 

He was so close to her that she felt 
.the warmth of his great red cloak, 
and smelt the faint odor of some 
strange Oriental perfume that clung 
to his garments. 

"That is the difference between 
us," he added. "I am awake and 




4 
i 



alive. You are dozing. And he 
he is fast asleep." 

"He who?" she said, startled by 
his tone. 

" Milord, your husband. But though 
you are dozing, you are not asleep. 
You could be awake as I am awake. 
You could be alive as I am alive, if 
only" 

He stopped speaking and looked 
down at her. 

"If only what?" 

"If only you were not afraid of 
^being alive and of feeling joy." 

He seemed to tower over her. He 
'had stretched out one arm and the 
[great cloak made him look vast in 
[the night, vast and enveloping. The 
^perfume that came from the folds of 
>his scarlet and white clothes suggest- 
mystery and something else, a 
^distant ecstasy that might be reached 
travelling, by going forward and 
.onward. 



fci 



"For you are afraid," he said. 
"You are very much afraid." 

At that moment there was a shrill 
cry in the darkness of the gorge, a 
cry that sounded half human, half 
animal. Lady Wyverne started and 
instinctively clung to the Spahi's arm. 
Instantly the warm folds of his cloak 
were round her. The cry rose up once 
more, shrill, prolonged, and nearer. 
Then out of the gorge, into the moon- 
light that lay upon the road, there 
came a man capering and running. 
His face was fair and pale, like the 
face of a Christ in a picture, with a 
curling, yellow-brown beard and va- 
cant, restless, blue eyes. In his thin 
hands he held an enormous staff. He 
was dressed in bright green, and on his 
head there was a green-and-red turban. 

"Allah!" he shrieked, whirling the 
staff round and round, then pointing 
it suddenly to left and right. " Allah ! 
Allah! Al " 

43 





Lady Wyverne cowered against the 
Spahi. To her strung-up imagination 
it seemed as if the gorge had suddenly 
let loose a crazy Messiah to point at 
her a ringer of condemnation. She 
trembled as the strange figure stopped 
before her, as its shrill cry died away 
in a childish whimper, and its large, 
pale eyes rested upon hers in a glance 
of dull amazement. 

"What is ?" she began, stam- 
mering. 

"It is only the mad Marabout," 
said the Spahi, keeping his arm round 
her protectively. 

"The mad Marabout?" 

"He was a rich man of the village 
of Akbara, the red village, and loved 
a dancing -girl of Beni-Mora. One 
night in the week of the races the 
girl was murdered for her jewels by a 
Mehari rider from Touggourt. Since 
then he has been mad. He lives al- 
ways out-of-doors. He eats only 



44 






what he is given, what is put into 
hand. He sleeps upon the ground. 
By night he wanders, seeking the girl 
who is dead and calling upon Allah to 
assist him. Allah! Allah!" 

Suddenly the Spahi lifted up his 
voice in a powerful cry. Instantly 
the Marabout began once more to 
whirl his staff. 

"Allah!" he shrieked. "Allah! 
Allah!" 

And he capered along the road 
towards the desert, striking to right 
and left of him as if attacking the 
moonbeams that bore him company. 

"He sees the murderer of Ayesha 
in every ray of the light-giver," said 
the Spahi. 

"Why not in us, then?" said Lady 
Wyverne, with a shudder. 

" Who knows why ? Who can read 
in the soul of the madman?" 

The Marabout was lost in the night, 
and suddenly Lady Wyverne was 

45 





aware of the arm enclosing her. She 
moved quickly and it fell from about 
her. But as she walked on she still 
seemed to feel it, as one who has been 
touched by a powerful hypnotist 
seems to feel the magnetic hand long 
after it has been removed. 



V 



THAT night, as Lady Wyverne lay 
awake, listening to the sound 
of the river passing through the 
gorge on its way to the Sahara, she 
was troubled as she had never been 
troubled before. Her light not 
wicked and fashionable life had 
always hitherto been governed by 
caprice, but caprice had led her al- 
ways down flowery pathways stretch- 
ing into spaces washed with light, 
never into the dimness of mystery/ 
or the blackness of sorrow. She had // 
often felt quickly but never pas-;, ,. 
sionately. Wayward she had ever //'/. 
been, but not violent, not really ; 
reckless; a creature of fantasy, not} 








a creature of tempest. The song of T 
JJI 1 the boy Arab under the rock by the j 
1 river she had been like that; like aj 
?* winding, airy tune going out into the * 
sun. Now she was conscious of the 
*S-tL. further mysteries, that lead some 
women on to deeds that strike like 
hammers upon the smooth compla- 
cencies of society, she was aware of 
the beckoning finger that pilots the 
eager soul whither it should not go, 
among the great wastes where emo- 
tion broods and wonder is alive. 

For the first time in her well-filled 
life she was very consciously in want. 
She had been fond of change, yes, 
but of such consecrated change; the 
change from Mayfair to Monte Carlo, 
or from the Scotch moors to the Rue 
de la Paix. Now, suddenly, this life 
seemed to her as unreal as a harle- 
quinade in which she had been play- 
ing Columbine, and something within 

her desired a violently different life. 
48 



That she could have it was impos- 
sible. Therefore she was unhappy. 
It was a new experience to her to be 
confronted by that word impossi- 
ble. It seemed to insult her. All the 
flower of her careless contentment 
with herself, and her life, and the 
little kingdom she had ruled, shriv- 
elled up. She was the child crying 
for the moon. 

But she was a child who had been 
offered the moon, who would be of- 
fered the moon again. Where, then, 
was the impossibility she brooded 
over ? It was created by herself and 
vy existed within herself. The soul's " I 
\ could never do that!" was the fiat 
f& that expressed it. 
\ With the sound of the river seemed 
to come to her faintly the cry of the 
^. mad Marabout seeking the murdered 
dancing -girl in the moonbeams. It 
_ was a cry from the savage world on 
threshold of which she stood. 




T

The man In the scarlet cloak and the 
man in the bright-green robe were the 
two salient figures in it for her, the 
one protecting her, the other coming 
as if to assail her, then falling list- 
lessly from his apparent purpose and 
capering away intent upon his crazy 
quest. To-night these two figures 
seemed more real to her, more vital, 
than the figure of her husband. 

The Spahi had spoken the words, 
"Barbary sheep," with an ironical 
^intonation, and she had read his 
^ thought and her mind had echoed 
(it. Yet of " Crumpet 's " complete de- 
votion to her she had no doubt. He 
'loved her, he would defend her against 

e world, he would lie down for her 
[to tread upon, if she desired it, but 
[ he was "poor old Crumpet," a ru- 
idimentary man. There was no mys-- 
[tery in him. 

She sniffed in the darkness as if 
| inhaling a perfume. She was think- 






ing of the perfume that clung about 
the folds of the Spahi's cloak. It was 
like a part of him and of the land he 
dwelled in. She would have thought 
effeminate a scented Western man. 
But this, and many another thing, is 
readily forgiven to an Oriental. They 
are "different" from us, these people 
of the sun. It was this "difference" 
that had stirred the curiosity and 
something more of Lady Wyverne. 
Scent and a baby voice, a revolver 
ready to protect her, an arm that felt 
like iron under a scarlet cloak, black 
eyes that were fierce as a hawk's or 
velvety with tenderness she moved 
uneasily in her bed. She was hot 
and restless and had no desire for 
sleep. What was this man? What 
was his real nature, gentle or bar- 
barous? His manners were perfect, 
even in their occasional impudence! 
And his heart? Had he been cruel 
to women? 

Si 





She had known all about Crumpet 
after talking to him for half an hour. 
She had even read him at a glance, 
divined exactly his tastes, realized 
his foibles, summed up his faults and 
his virtues, "placed" him, in fact. 
England breeds such men all the 
time to follow her traditions, to live 
and to die British to the bone. Crum- 
pet was a thorough Englishman, a 
right-down good-fellow, to be trusted 
at sight. Well, she had trusted him 
and married him. And ever since 
then she had had a good time. And 
her one aim in life had been just that 
to have a good time. 

And now? What did she want? 
How silly and ridiculous and mad- 
dening it all was! 

Suddenly she got up. Intending 
only to stay one night at El-Akbara, 
>they had sent on their servants with 
imost of the heavy luggage to Beni- 
Mora, to engage the best rooms, see to 





T 



their arrangement, unpack, and have 
everything ready and charming for 
their arrival. She had meant to 
play at roughing it here. Now she 
looked about for her stockings and 
slippers by the light of a candle. 
When at length she had found them, 
she wrapped herself up in a fur cloak, 
stepped out onto the veranda, and be-j| 
gan to walk up and down. She passed 
and repassed Crumpet 's window . Once 
or twice she stopped in front of it, 
hesitating. She was half inclined to 
go into his room, to wake him, to tell 
him that he must think no more of 
Barbary sheep, but take her away on 
the morrow to Beni-Mora. Then she 
walked on again, saying to herself that 
it would be a shame to wake the tired 
man who was snoring so rhythmically. 
If only Crumpet didn't snore! 
Lady Wyverne caught herself won- 
dering whether other people yes, 
other people snored. 

53 





The moon faded, and the thread of 
the road beyond the Judas-trees lost 
its silvery hue and looked gray. The 
air was colder. 

"Barbary sheep," Lady Wyverne 
murmured to herself. 

She stopped again by Crumpet's 
window, and this time she pushed it 
back and went into his room, treading 
softly. A faint light, entering behind 
her, showed her vaguely the bed and 
the long body stretched upon it. She 
touched the body with her little hand. 

"Crumpet!" 

"Er a-ah!" 

The snore was broken, and from 
the sleeper's mouth came a heavy, 
sighing exclamation that sounded like 
a dull protest drowned in a yawn. 
Lady Wyverne pushed the body. 

"Crumpet!" 

"A-ah!" 

" It's no use. You've got to wake 
up!" 

54 



Sir Claude shifted round, making 
the bed creak, heaved himself half 
up, sank back again, opened his eyes, 
and stared. 

" Is it a-ah ! is it Achmed ?" 

" No, it isn't Achmed. Wake up !" 

" Who the dev " He put out his 
hand and felt her hand, her face. 
"Kitty! What is it? You're not 
ill?" 

"No." 

She sat down on a hard chair by 
his bed. 

"It's only that I can't sleep." 

"What's the a-ah! what's the 
time?" 

"I don't know. Never mind. I 
want to talk." 

He lay resting on his elbow and 
staring towards her in the gloom 
She thought he looked like a huge 
ghost. 

"What about? I wonder if it '11 
be a good mornin' for sport." 





" Crumpet, haven't you had enough 
sport?" , 

"Enough how d' you mean?" j 

" Aren't you tired of killing things ?" ' 

She thought she saw an expression 
of blank surprise come into his face, 
but she was not quite certain. The 
gloom prevented her from being cer- 
tain. 

"Tired of killin' things? Why?" 

"Wouldn't you rather make things 
live, things that aren't really alive? 
Wouldn't you, Crumpet?" 

" What d' you mean, Kitty ? Make 
things live! I ain't Providence." 

"No, but " 

"Stop a sec " He laid one hand 
on her arm. "Isn't that Achmed 
bringing out the mules ? I say, what 
is the time ? We're goin' farther into 
the mountains to-day." 

"Must you go? Must you go so 
far?" 

"Well, Achmed says" 
56 




"I don't want to hear about 
Achmed. He's a great, ugly, horrid 
creature." 

"Ugly! What's it matter if he's 
ugly? Why, he's the very deuce for 
knowin' where the " 

"Don't say Barbary sheep, Crum- 
pet! For mercy's sake, don't say 
Barbary sheep!" 

"Well, but it's Barbary sheep 
we're goin' after. What's the matter 
with you, Kitty?" 

" I could never explain so that you 
could understand." 

" Ee ya ! Ee ee ya !" 

\There came a cry from below, a 
stamping of hoofs upon stone. Sir 
Claude sprang up. 
"Jove, it is Achmed! I must get 
^sr into my togs! I say, Kitty " 
^-. But she had glided away like a 
shadow and left him. 

When he was dressed he came out 



": :=gg=onto the veranda and found her there, 




< 



leaning on the parapet and looking 
over at Achmed and the mules. 

"Do go to bed, Kitty," he said. 

"What's the good if I can't sleep ?" 

"But you generally sleep stun- 
ninly." 

"I know." 

"Don't this place suit you?" 

He looked at her with a sudden 
anxiety, but she felt sure the anx- 
iety was for himself. 

"Perhaps not," she answered. 

" D' you want to get away?" 

He gazed at her almost fearfully. 
"Barbary sheep," she thought, and 
she laughed bitterly. She read Crum- 
pet's mind with such horrible ease. 
She saw into him with such precision. 
And what was there to see ? A whole 
flock of Barbary sheep waiting to be 
killed. 

" Oh, go along, Crumpet!" she said, 
almost roughly. "Don't stand here 
S asking me questions when you might 






,f : 



be killing things. Just think of it, 
Crumpet! Killing poor, innocent, 
happy things!" 

And she laughed again with an 
irony that startled him. 

"You ain't well, Kitty," he said. 
"You ain't yourself." 

"As if you knew what myself is!" 

She threw the words at him sav- 
agely. At that moment she was like 
a little tigress. 

He stared, then, as she turned 
away, he went off muttering to him- 
self: "What the devil's up? What's 
come to Kitty?" It struck him that 
she must be getting bored, and he 
resolved not to stay for a week as he 
had intended, not to go after gazelle. 
He even hesitated for a moment 
when he was in the court-yard, and 
thought of giving up his expedition, 
of returning to his wife, of leaving 
with her that day for Beni-Mora. 

But Achmed held the mule for him, 

59 





with huge, black eyes mutely inviting 
him to mount. And the thought of 
the cool air on the mountain, the 
savagery of the rocky wastes, the sun- 
rise, over the distant desert, and the 
prey the prey that was so difficult to 
come at rose in his mind. He had 
his imagination of the hunter, though 
Lady Wyverne did not realize it. 
And it tempted him, it enticed him, 
as she was tempted and enticed by 
the Goblin men of Goblin market, 
who laid their hands upon her sleeve 
in the empty hours, and whispered, 
"Come come where we will lead 
you!" 






VI 



THAT morning, when she came^ -, 
down to breakfast, Lady Wyv-| 
erne did not see the Spahi. But she 
had not seen him on the previous 
morning. She realized that as well 
as a desert man he was a man of the 
world. He had lived with French 
officers and had been to Paris, and 
knew when to give way to his desire 
and when to hold back. The good 
people of the inn, after the table- 
d'hote dinner was over, went to their 
supper, and from their supper straight 
to their beds, leaving only an Arab 
to look after the door. Arabs are 
great gossips. But this Arab would 
not gossip. The Spahi had taken 

61 





thought for that. But when the sun 
was up he was away. Lady Wyverne 
wondered where. 

After breakfast she wandered out 
through the gorge and the gate of the 
Sahara, accompanied by a guide from 
the inn, a slim and sleepy youth, who 
smiled at her and smoked cigarettes 
and said little. When they came in 
sight of the river she heard a piping, 
and there, under the orange-colored 
rock, sat the Arab boy who played 
the capricious tune. She stopped 
for a moment to listen to it. She 
did not know that she was a being 
made up of caprice, but there was 
something in the airy music that ap- 
pealed to her. 

"Is he always there playing?" she 
asked of the guide. 

"Always, madame." 

"Doesn't he get sick of it?" 

"Madame?" 

"Doesn't he get bored always sit- 



ting in the same place and doing the 
same thing?" 

"I do not know, madame." 

It was evident that the guide had 
no idea what being bored might mean. 
Lady Wyverne looked at him almost 
with envy. The hurry and rush of 
modern life seemed more than strange 
here, crazy and vulgar. She won- 
dered whether, if she were to remain 
in this land, she could catch its dream- 
ing silence, could be moulded by its 
large simplicity into a simpler woman. 

"Shall we go to the red village, 
madame?" 

"Which is it? That one on the 
hill?" 

"Yes, madame." 

She nodded. The great palm gar- 
dens that fringed the river and*// 
nestled round the brown earth houses/ & 
attracted her, held for her a charm. 7 
They looked opulent and mysterious, 
as if strange beings passed strange m 
6 3 









:' shadows. She 

' guide into the green fastnesses of the j 
c'j* grove, and the Arab boy's melody died ' 
away in the embraces of the sun. 

Presently the river made a curve, 
and she perceived that to gain the 
red village she must cross it. She 
glanced about for stepping-stones, 
but could see none. 

" How do we get across ?" she asked 
the Arab. 

"I shall carry madame. But we 
must go a little lower down. The 
water is deep here." 

They went on slowly over the un- 
even brown earth among the wrinkled 
trunks. Lady Wyverne looked more 
closely than before at her attendant. 
He was quite a boy, with small limbs, 
delicate hands. She looked at the 
running water. 

"You will never be able to carry 
me," she said. 

64 



GL 



\ 



"Oh yes, madame. And if you 
fall you will not be drowned." 

She could not help laughing at his 
nonchalance, but his answer hardly 
reassured her. 

"Is it much farther the ford, I 
mean?" she asked. 

" Where that apricot-tree leans over 
the water, madame." 

He pointed. As he did so a figure 
came out from the recesses of the 
grove and stood quite still beneath 
the fruit tree. 

"There is Benchaalal!" said the 
guide. 

"Benchaalal?" 

"The Spahi." 

Lady Wyverne shaded her eyes 
. with one hand. 

"Who is he?" she asked, care- 
\ lessly. 

But she had recognized the com- 
panion of her night walks, and her 
heart beat perceptibly quicker. 

6 S 





"He is at madame's hotel. Ma- 
dame has seen him." 

"Oh, the officer." 

"He is terrible. He is the best 
horseman of the Sahara. With the 
revolver he can hit any stone I throw 
up into the air so!" 

He flung a stone up towards the 
quivering blue of the sky. 

" All women who see him love him. 
In Algiers they die for him, and in the 
desert, where he returns to his father's 
house, they will cry out thus from 
morning until evening." 

He broke into a high twittering like 

bird. The man under the apricot- 
tree turned round and looked towards 
them. 

"Hush!" said Lady Wyverne. 

But the boy did not heed her. 
Delighted with the success of his 
female impersonation, he twittered 

The Spahi 



more shrilly than before. 



When he was 



close to them he lifted his hand to his 
turban and saluted gravely. 

" I believe I have had the honor of 
seeing madame at the hotel ?" he said, 
almost as if interrogatively. "Ma- 
dame is going to cross the river?" 

Lady Wyverne hesitated. She 
knew, of course, that the Spahi was 
going to carry her over. She saw his 
intention in his long and subtle eyes. 
She wished him to carry her. She 
even longed ridiculously to be carried 
by him. But she hesitated, because 
she was now fully aware that there 
was within her something that was 
more than wilful, something that was 
only kept back from running wild by 
a what? A thin thread of resolu- 
tion that might be snapped in a 
moment, or even brushed aside. And 
she feared that the touch of the 
Spahi, like the hand of the East laid 
upon her, might snap, or brush aside 
that barrier, might send her unfet- 




tered, unrestrained, into a terrible 
world of light. 

But while Lady Wyverne hesitated 
the guide spoke. 

"I am going to carry madame 
across." 

The Spahi laughed. His little, even 
teeth gleamed between his dark lips. 

"Madame permits me?" 

He took Lady Wyverne up in his 
arms. 

"No!" she said. 

He looked into her face. As he 
did so he made a secret sign to the 
guide to pull off his gaiters and 
boots. The boy bent down to do 
so, swiftly, deftly. 

" Why not ? It is only a moment." 

He balanced himself on one foot. 
The first gaiter and boot were off. 

She was quite still in his arms. She 
^felt as if he could hold her forever 
^without fatigue. 

"I don't want to go." 

68 




5 V^ II**WWP* 




"But you were going, 
afraid of the water?" 

"No." 

" Are you afraid of me ?" 

He balanced himself on the other 
foot. The second gaiter and boot 
were off, and the Spahi's bare, brown 
feet clung to the hot stones as if they 
loved them. 

"Yes," she said. 

She did not know why she said it. 
Certainly she did not say it merely 
because it was true. 

" I will teach you not to be afraid," 
he murmured. 

And he stepped into the water. 

Lady Wyverne shut her eyes be- 
cause, since this thing was to be, she 
desired to feel, to realize it to the 
utmost. When the Spahi put her 
down on the opposite shore she 
sighed, almost like a child. She 
opened her eyes and they rested upon 
the Spahi's bare feet. 






The foot of the desert man is as 
expressive as his hand, and often as 
fine, as delicate. These feet gave to 
Lady Wyverne an extraordinary im- 
pression of finesse, which almost made 
her think of herself as clumsy. She 
contrasted swiftly this vital impres- 
sion of finesse with the equally vital 
impression of strength of which she 
had just been conscious, and she 
wondered at the extremes that were 
mingled in this man, at the woman 
la that was surely in him as well as the 
j man and the savage man. Suddenly 
giving the rein to her impulse, she 
said: 

"Have you your revolver?" 

He drew it instantly from the folds 
of his scented garments. 

"Throw up a stone," she said to 
the guide, who had just come up to 
them, holding the boots and gaiters 
of the Spahi in his hand. 

The boy went away a few steps, 
70 



stood in front of the Spahi, looked at 
him, bent down and picked up a 
stone. The Spahi smiled and lifted 
the hand that held the revolver. He 
cried out a word in Arabic. The 
boy flung the stone high into the 
blue. There was a sharp report, and 
it fell in splinters and was hidden 
by the water of the river. 

"Crumpet couldn't do that!" 

"Madame?" 

The exclamation had come invol- 
untarily from Lady Wyverne's lips. 

' ' Crompetes vous dites ? ' ' 

"Au revoir, monsieur, and many 
thanks." 

She suddenly realized that she was 
losing her head, turned quickly away, 
and began to walk towards the 
village. The Spahi did not attempt// 
to follow her. But he detained thef ^ 
guide for a moment, and spoke rapidly ^j 
to him in Arabic. 

That afternoon at four Lady Wy-i 





u ,tr 



for her husband. The wicker tea- j 
table was beside her. She looked 



L* across the court between the Judas- 
trees to the dusty road, and listened 
for the sound of mules' tripping feet. 
But she did not hear them. The 
time passed on. Crumpet was later 
than usual. At last she was tired of 
waiting and called over the balus- 
trade to the Arab below to bring up 
tea. Just as it was being brought 
there came along the road an Arab 
boy with a piece of paper in his hand. 
He turned in through the gateway, 
looked up to Lady Wyverne, and held 
up the paper. 

"Is it for me?" she asked. 

He nodded. She beckoned to him 
to come, and in a moment he was be- 
side her and had given her the note. 
It was from Sir Claude. 

"DARLING OLD GIRL, D' you mind 
very much if I do not come back to-night ? 
72 



I've got two sheep this morning, and 
Achmed says if I stay out and sleep at 
some place near a salt mountain with the 
devil's own name I can be certain of 
potting some gazelle at sundown. Back 
to-morrow without fail, and ready to move 
on to Beni what you may call it. Love, 

" CRUMPET." 

Lady Wyverne gave the boy a coin 
and sat down alone to tea. 

"Why did Providence give me a 
fool for a husband?" 

That was her thought. 

As she sipped her tea she seemed to 
see the Spahi's brown feet resting on 
the warm stones by the river. They 

\clung to the stones as sensitively as 
hands could have clung. She imag- 
fe ined them padding softly over the 

\desert sands. 

^=_ And a woman's feet trod beside 
"^^. them. 




VII 



THE place with the devil's own 
name alluded to by Sir Claude 
was El-Alia in the plain at the foot 
of the salt mountain, which travellers 
see from the train as they journey to 
Beni-Mora. That evening, as dark- 
ness was closing in, Sir Claude, weary 
with a long day's hunting, but trium- 
phant in the knowledge of slaughtered 
Barbary sheep and gazelle, was seated 
under a vine before the door of an 
auberge kept by an elderly French- 
woman, discussing with a voracious 
appetite an excellent meal of gazelle, 
with vegetables, a chicken, a cous- 
cous, and a salad, washed down by 
a bottle of thin red wine, which he 




would have despised in London, but 
which now seemed to him more de- 
licious than a vintage claret drunk 
under ordinary town circumstances. 
The two days of out -door life in 
wild surroundings and glorious air, 
the contact with Africans, who were 
mighty hunters, his prowess in killing 
things as Lady Wyverne described 
sport had given an edge to his spirit 
as well as to his appetite. He felt 
in glorious condition, at peace with 
himself and all the world. The only 
cloud to dim his immense satisfaction 
was the thought of his promise to Kitty 
to go away on the morrow. Beni- 
Mora was far less good as a sporting 
centre than El-Akbara. He would 
have liked to spend another week, or, 
better, another month, at the cosey 
little hotel in the gorge. Only Kitty 
was bored. She had showed it. She 
had asked him to take her away. 
Vaguely he remembered their inter- 




view in the night. He had been 
half asleep at first, and afterwards 
pre- occupied by the thought that 
Achmed was bringing round the 
mules. Nevertheless, he remembered 
Kitty's odd, nervous anxiety, the 
unusual irony and bitterness of her 
speech. 

"P'r'aps she thinks I'm neglectin' 
her," he thought, as he refilled his 
glass. "Women never understand 
what sport is to a man, unless they 
shoot themselves. And Kitty hates 
a gun." 

That she liked a revolver he did 
not know. 

He put down his glass and turned 
in his chair, looking towards the open 
door of the auberge. 

"Caf eT' he shouted. 

"Voila!" shrieked a voice from 
Svithin. 

Sir Claude smiled and drew forth 

his cigar-case, at the same time 

76 






stretching out his long legs with 
audible grunt of satisfaction. 

Achmed had gone off to eat and 
chatter with friends in the village, 
which lay hidden among palms a few 
hundred yards from the auberge, and 
the coffee was brought out by the 
landlady, who set it on the table and 
then asked monsieur if he had en- 
joyed his dinner. 

Sir Claude felt expansive, and his 
reply brought joy to his cook's heart. 
For landlady and cook were both rep- 
resented by the stout woman with 
the gray hair, the wrinkled cheeks, 
and the blue apron who stood before 
| him, watching him with shrewd curi- 
| osity in her dark-gray eyes. 

"Sit down, madame," said Sir 
Claude, genially, in his English pub- 
lic-school French. "Sit down and 
take a glass of cognac." 

The landlady obeyed, smiling and 
smoothing her apron. She admired 




77 




man, and she considered Sir 
Claude an exceedingly handsome 
specimen of humanity. 

"What brought you to this out- 
of-the-way place?" continued Sir 
Claude. 

The landlady sipped her cognac 
with an "a votre sante", monsieur 1" 
and proceeded to relate her history, 
or that part of it which she thought 
edifying how she had been born at 
Marseilles and brought to Algiers by 
her parents; how she had married a 
waiter in a cafe who had taken to 
drink and at last lived only for ab- 
sinthe; how they had drifted from 
one place to another, and finally 
settled at El- Alia, where he had died 
three years before. 

"And you live alone here among 
the Arabs?" cried Sir Claude. 

"No, m'sieur, I have my nephew 
Robert. But to-night he is at Beni- 
Mora. He has gone to buy provi- 



sions. All our tinned food comes 
from there." 

She sipped again with her eyes on 
Sir Claude. The shadows beneath 
the vine grew deeper. The pale salt 
mountain was fading away like a 
ghost in the night. Over the wide 
and lonely land the desert wind came 
sighing, bringing a vital, an almost 
stinging freshness of the wastes. Sir 
Claude gazed out across the plain, 
then at the gray-haired Frenchwoman 
with her little liqueur - glass in her 
fingers. 

"Even so, it's a solitary life, ma- 
dame," he said. "But I suppose 
you make friends with the Arabs?" 

The landlady curled her lips, and 
an almost malignant, catlike look 
came into her face. 

"Oh, la, la! The Arabs!" she ex- 
claimed. "The Arab is traitre, 
m'sieur. Every Arab that was ever 
born is traitre. You may take my 






word for it. I have lived among 
them nearly all my life. Never trust 
an Arab. He will live with you for 
twenty years and then cut your 
throat for a sou. What I have seen! 
What I have known among the Arabs ! 
They are clever, but yes! They are 
handsome. They can get round a 
man, and as for women well!" She 
spread out her hands and shrugged 
her shoulders. " I myself when I was 
younger but enough! The Arab is 
traitre, m'sieu. He will sell his soul 
for money, and to satisfy his lust he 
will lie, he will cajole, he will bribe, he 
will betray, he will murder. I could 
tell you stories! And an Arab is 
always an Arab. He never changes. 
He seems to change yes, but it is 
only the surface. The bottom is al- 
ways the same. He goes to Paris. 
He speaks French as I do. He learns 
the lovely manners of the Parisian. 
Mon Dieu! He might go to a court 

So 




if we had one in my beautiful France. 
And then he comes back to the desert 
and at once all is forgotten. He sits 
in the sand, he spits, he eats cous- 
cous with his fingers he is a camel, 
m'sieu, he is a camel. Such is the 
Arab! Beware of him! Has m'sieu 
a wife?" 

The abrupt question startled Sir 
Claude, who had been listening to this 
tirade with a good deal of astonish- 
ment. 

"Er yes," he replied, uneasily. 

"Never let her have anything to 
K do with the Arabs!" 

\"Good Lord, madame! As if my 
wife" 

f "Never, never 1" continued the 
\landlady, vehemently. "The Arab 
===_. has a charm for women. I myself 
""N have felt it, I who speak to you ! He 
calls and they come. I could tell you 
___ of European ladies but enough ! The 
desert holds its mysteries. I re- 





member Benchaalal, the Spahi, the 
son of Mohammed Ali, he who came 
from the Zibans and is now an officer 
in Algiers. The stories he has told 
me of his doings! The things he has 
related to me of the French ladies 

"The Spahi!" said Sir Claude, more 
uneasily. "What did you say his 
name was?" 

"Benchaalal, m'sieu, son of Mo- 
hammed Ali, the great Caid. He is 
beautiful. One cannot deny it. He 
speaks French perfectly. He shoots 
ah, no Frenchman can shoot like 
him! He is strong. I have seen him 
take up a walnut and crack it in his 
fingers." 

"The devil!" 

"M'sieu?" 

"Nothing. Go on, madame, go 
on!" 

Sir Claude had sat up, and was now 
leaning forward in his chair with his 
eyes fixed upon his garrulous com- 




panion. The darkness took the wide 
spaces of the land, and the night 
wind came again over the immense 
flats, and made the dry and dusty 
leaves of the vine rustle above their 
heads. 

"But he is the most traitre of all 
the Arabs, and he loves to tell of his 
villanies. When he goes to the 
desert to visit his father, he always 
passes by here. Sometimes he stays 
for a day or two and goes out after 
gazelle. And at night he sits here 
under the vine with me, m'sieu, as 
you are doing now, and he talks. 
Ah, he is cruel, and yet 

Again she spread out her hands 
and blew forth a sigh to join the wind 
among the vine-leaves. 

" One must look at him. One must 
listen to him. M'sieu, I dare say the 
devil, if he came out of the desert, if 
he sat here, I dare say the devil would 
charm a w r oman. Who knows?" 
83 




"You say he can crack a walnut 
with his fingers?" 

"But yes, m'sieu. And yet his 
hands are slim as a woman's. Tiens ! 
He should be passing here in a day or 
two. They tell me he is en congeV' 

"Who told you so?" 

"Do I remember? These things 
go from mouth to mouth in the desert 
as quickly as fire from straw to straw. 
We have news in the desert, I can tell 
you. It is getting dark. Shall I 
fetch the lamp out here for m'sieu?" 

"Yes, fetch the lamp, madame." 

The landlady got up and went 
quickly in through the door, her gray 
dress wagging from her broad hips. 
When she had gone Sir Claude got 
up, too, and went to the entrance of 
the arbor. He could no longer see 
the salt mountain. It was a dark 
? night, for the moon had not yet risen, 
s Presently it would come and bathe 
this lonely world in light. Meanwhile 





he wanted the lamp. The 
added to a strange apprehension 
which had been brought to him by 
the landlady's gossip. As he stood 
staring vaguely before him towards 
the desert, he remembered his first 
evening in the inn at El-Akbara. He 
had got up from the dining-table to 
go to bed and had heard a sharp little 
sound in the room. He seemed to 
hear it now, to see the Spahi delicately 
extracting the kernel from the nut- 
shell. Even then he had been con- 
scious of a faint and creeping un- 
easiness, of a hesitation which he had 
not understood. The Spahi was cer- 
tainly this Benchaalal. Of that he 
was convinced. 

Well, and what if he was ? 

Sir Claude was not a very imagina- 
tive man, but he was not totally 
devoid of imagination. He was, as 
has been said, by nature somewhat 
cautious and sceptical, as Lady Wyv- 

8s 






erne was incautious and inclined to 
superstition and credulity. But he 
had never doubted his wife. He 
loved her, but even if he had not, the 
mere fact that she was his wife would 
probably have preserved her from 
any suspicion on his part. Yet he 
had lived in the London world from 
time to time and knew what went on 
sometimes there. He had heard cer- 
tain husbands laughed at, or sneered 
at in the clubs, and had seen them 
welcomed immediately afterwards by 
the laughers and the sneerers with 
open hands and hearts. He had 
known charming women to do things 
that were not charming to use no 
stronger phrase. 

What had been the matter with 
Kitty that morning? 

The landlady came back with a 
lamp which she set down on the table. 
But now Sir Claude felt restless, as if 
he could not return to his chair. 

86 



"I wonder where Achmed is," he 
said. 

" In the village, m'sieu. Ah, Ach- 
med he is another of them!" 

"Achmed?" 

" But yes, m'sieu. The things he 
has done, the things he will do for a 
few francs! You would not believe 
them if I told you." 

" Is he is Achmed a friend of this 
Spahi?" 

" Of Benchaalal ? A friend I would 
not say. Benchaalal is proud. And 
since he has been in Paris ah, he 
does not speak with every one, not 
he!" 

"But he knows Achmed?" 

" And how should he not know him, 
m'sieu? Why 

But Sir Claude interrupted the 
good woman abruptly. 

' ' Tell me , " he said . ' ' Are you quite 
sure that Ben what is it?" 

"Benchaalal, m'sieu." 





"That Benchaalal has not passed T 
by here without stopping?" 

"He has not passed, m'sieu. If: 
# he had I should know it. They would 

have seen him at the station." 
=^-=^ "And you know he is en conge?" 

"M'sieu, he is. He should have 
come by yesterday at latest, if not 
the day before. But perhaps he is at 
El-Akbara, where m'sieu is staying. 
I asked Achmed." 

"What did he say?" 

" He said no. But what does that 
mean? Achmed is an Arab, and an 
Arab never tells the truth." 

"Well, au revoir, madame." 

"M'sieu is going to bed already? 
And just as I have brought the 
lamp!" 

" No, I am going for a stroll to the 
village. Leave the lamp. I shall 
soon be back to drink another bottle 
of wine." 

"M'sieu is too good. But is 

88 



m'sieu armed? It is not safe to 
wander at night without arms." 

Grimly Sir Claude looked at her, 
pulling out of one of his pockets the 
muzzle of a revolver. 

"It's all right, madame." 
"Bien! Bien! Aurevoir, m'sieu." 
"Au revoir, madame." 
He walked away in the darkness. 
The landlady stood under the vine 
looking after him. 

" What has he ?" she said to herself. 

She had noticed that a change 

had come over her guest while she 

had been talking, that his air of calm 

Vy satisfaction, peculiar to the success- 

\ ful hunter full fed after a long day's 

{& sport, had given place to a moody 

\ anxiety, a restlessness that betokened 

_^ an altered mood. 

^., " What has he, this monsieur ?" she 
repeated to herself. 

The wind from the desert blew 
strongly among the vine leaves 

~^=r^ 80 




above her head, and the lamp flame 
flickered uneasily. 

Behind the salt mountain there 
grew slowly a pale light that heralded 
the coming of the moon. 




VIII 



SIR CLAUDE walked through the 
darkness towards the village. As 
he went, treading softly on the dry 
and sandy road, he thought of the 
prophecy of the astrologer in Paris, 
he seemed to see the thin red lines 
of meticulous writing: 

" Danger d'une grande perte la 
plus grande perte possible." 

And then he thought of the young 
Spahi, sitting by the small table -in 
the hotel dining-room, and smiling 
gently as he cracked the walnut with 
his fingers and drew out the kernel 
that nestled within. And then he 
thought of Achmed. 

Achmed was a mighty hunter, and 




had won Sir Claude's enthusiastic 
admiration. Tall, lithe, one-eyed, 
with long, yellow teeth shaded by a 
thin, wiry, black mustache, he was 
not beautiful to look upon. But he 
knew his business and took a pleasure 
in it. He had been eager for these 
sporting expeditions. Perhaps he 
had been too eager. 

The landlady of the auberge had 
an influence. She had infected Sir 
Claude with her own distrust of these 
desert men. Of his wife he was 
thinking now, with the anxious, pro- 
tective sentiment of the strong, lov- 
ing man; of himself with an angry 
bitterness. How could he have left 
her alone, without even her maid, in 
an inn lost in the wilderness, while he 
was gratifying his selfish lust for 
t sport? The loneliness of the desert 
^around him, the darkness, the keen 
?wind against his brown cheeks roused 
in him a sort of fury against himself. 






The cosey little hostelry in the g< 
presented itself to his imagination as 
a cut-throat, desolate shanty. And 
there, among wild, treacherous people 
who would slit any one's throat for a 
few sous, he had left the whimsical, 
fair-haired little creature he adored 
alone to face the night. 

He hurried on. And again he 
thought of Achmed and of the Spahi, 
connecting them together in his mind. 

Achmed had been very eager for 
him to stay at El-Akbara, had urged 
him repeatedly to remain for a long 
time, had painted in glowing colors 
the wonders of the region, and had 
spoken of Beni-Mora as a place for 
invalids and old women, intolerable 
to men. He had read at a glance, 
Arab fashion, the character of Sir 
Claude, and had played upon it with 
a subtle cunning. Had he not ? But 
all this might have been merely in 
order that the guide might pocket Sir 





Claude's money. That would be rea- 
son enough for his persuasion. 

"P'r'aps it's all rot!" said Sir 
Claude to himself, resorting to his 
favorite phrase. 

Nevertheless, he hurried on till 
he came to the first earth houses of 
the village. Their doors of palm 
were shut. Here and there, above 
these shut doors, the skulls of camels 
grinned. Through the eye-sockets 
strings of red pepper were hung, 
la Upon the flat roofs lean white, or 
| yellow, dogs ran to and fro, bending 
down their heads and barking furious- 
ly at the stranger as he passed. 

Again Sir Claude was conscious of 
the savagery of this land, and was 
stabbed by remorse for his selfish 
carelessness. Like many men who 
are not clever, he was inclined either 
to minimize or to exaggerate things. 
He had thought nothing of leaving 
P? his wife alone for a night. Now he 



thought too much of it. It seemed 
to him a monstrous dereliction of 
duty. 

A shadow stole out from among the 
blind and shadowy houses and padded 
softly after him on bare feet. He 
turned sharply, his hand on his re- 
volver. 

"What d' you want?" he said, in 
French. 

The shadow stopped and gazed at 
him steadily, with glittering eyes 
above which a hood was drawn for- 
ward hiding the head. 

Sir Claude repeated his question, 
but got no answer. 

"Here, you come along with me!" 
he exclaimed. "I won't have you /jfy 
behind." f^f 

* i 

He made an explanatory gesture. // /./ 
The shadow understood it and quiet- ; 
ly obeyed. Evidently comprehend- M 1 



ing why the stranger was there, itr.a 
guided him down a narrow alley,) 





across a runlet of water, and into an 
open space, a sort of Arab place, orj 
piazza, on the farther side of which- 
lights shone from a native cafe maure. 
Here, squatting upon the floor, among 
,a crowd of hooded men, was Achmed 
with a coffee-cup beside him, intent 
on playing draughts. 

When he saw his master he in- 
stantly rose with a smile, pushed his 
companions away without ceremony, 
and invited Sir Claude to come in and 
sit down on an earthen divan. But 
Sir Claude had no mind for pleasure. 

"Come out, Achmed!" he said, 
standing rigid in the low doorway. 
"I want to speak to you." 
' Achmed seriously saluted his 
friends, swung a fold of his burnous 
over his left shoulder, picked out his 
pair of yellow slippers from a medley 
against the wall, and gently stepped 
across to Sir Claude and followed him 
out into the night. 




The shadow glided after them. 

"Here, I say," said Sir Claude, 
irritably. "Get rid of this fellow. 
Give him something this. ' ' He held 
out a franc. "And tell him to be 
off." 

Achmed obeyed, and the shadow 
evaporated into the darkness. 

When they were alone, walking 
back towards the auberge, Sir Claude 
began : 

"How long would it take to get 
back to El-Akbara?" 

"El-Akbara, m'sieu! But it is im- 
possible." 

"Answer my question. How long 
would it take?" 

"If we start early to-morrow, 
^m'sieu, at sunrise 

" I don't mean to-morrow. I mean 
^.to-night." 

" I do not know, m'sieu. One does 
._ not make such a journey at night in 
Y~liig.the desert with a stranger." 




"With a stranger? What differ- 
ence does that make ?" 

"A rich stranger would not be safe 
at night in the desert. I am poor. 
I have nothing nothing." He flung 
out his arms in a large, despairing 
gesture, keeping his one eye fixed 
steadily on Sir Claude. "Therefore, 
I can go where I will. If monsieur 
wishes me to return to-night to El- 
Akbara, to take a message to madame, 
I will go, though the mules are tired. 
>But if monsieur asks me to accom- 
pany him, I dare not. For if an evil 
chance came to monsieur in my com- 
pany, no rich stranger would take 
[me as guide any more. I should be 
^ruined. I should fall into the misery. ' ' 

Sir Claude was silent for a moment. 
[The guide's assertions seemed rea- 
sonable. But Sir Claude remem- 
bered the landlady's words, that 
kAchmed would do anything for a few 
.francs. 



"And what if I paid you well?" 
he said. "What if I gave you a 
hundred francs?" 

"Monsieur says ?" 

"Suppose I gave you a hundred 
francs to come with me now, to- 
night, back to El-Akbara! Wouldn't 
you come?" 

"Monsieur, I dare not be respon- 
sible. If any harm " 

"What has Benchaalal paid you 
more, then?" exclaimed Sir Claude. 

He scarcely knew why he said it, 
why the ugly, the hideous surmise 
abruptly started into his mind. In- 
deed, it was only a wild guess that he 
was making, moved by something 
uneasy in Achmed's obstinacy, some- 
thing that suddenly suggested to Sir 
Claude that the Arab was balancing 
two offers, or was comparing the 
merits of two clients testing, as it 
were, the capacities of their respec- 
tive purses. Sir Claude did not often 





show intuition, but to-night there was 
unusual tension on his nerves. Some- 
thing in his heart seemed to play 
upon his intellect, to wake it up into 
a quickness that was not normal. 

" Benchaalal, monsieur ?" said Ach- 
med. "Who is that?" 

" You damned, deceitful rascal, you 
know well enough! Benchaalal, the 
Spahi, the officer from Algiers, who is 
staying at the inn at El-Akbara." 

Convicted of deception, Achmed, 
with perfect composure, left that 
question and inquired: 

"And why should Benchaalal give 
me money?" 

Sir Claude opened his lips to an- 
swer, but he said nothing. What 
could he say to a low-born Arab? 
Even if his wild surmise were true 
and why should it be true? he 
could not express it, could not even 
hint at it. The landlady of the inn 
had roused in him fear and suspicion 





and condemnation; fear for his 
suspicion of all Arabs, especially of 
Benchaalal and of Achmed, con- 
demnation of himself. But he must 
keep silence. Yet the complete com- 
posure of Achmed did not allay but 
* added to his mistrust. He felt posi- 

j 

5 tive that he had been persuaded to 
\ these long sporting expeditions, to 
this night away from El-Akbara, for 
reasons quite unconnected with ga- 
zelle and Barbary sheep. 

They had come out of the village 
now, and were in the desert close 
to the auberge. The moon was just 
| showing its edge above the cone of the 
| salt mountain and lifting the black- 
jf ness from the waste. Under the 
vine the little light of the lamp shone, 
showing the immobile figure of the 
old Frenchwoman watching for their 
return. 

Sir Claude made no reply to 
Achmed's question, but when he 





reached the auberge he suddenly said 
to Achmed. 

"Now, you just tell madame and 
me why you said to madame that 
Benchaalal was not staying at El- 
Akbara!" 

" Monsieur, I did not say so ! How 
could I when Benchaalal is there?" 

Sir Claude turned to the landlady, 
who was looking surprised and very 
curious. 

"Didn't you assure me, ma- 
dame ?" he began. 

But the landlady interrupted him. 

"Monsieur may talk all night, and 
all the nights of the year, but he will 
never have reason of an Arab." 

She spread out her hands and 
shrugged her shoulders. 

"C'est une sale race!" she whis- 
pered into Sir Claude's ear. 

He stood for a moment staring at 
the sand, his hands in his pockets. 
1 The moonlight grew. Its light de- 



cided him. He lifted up his head 
with a jerk of his chin. 

" Go and get the mules!" he said to 
Achmed. "Go!" 

The guide stared at him for a 
minute, then evidently realized that 
there was no appeal from that com- 
mand, and disappeared through the 
doorway of the auberge to the inner 
court, where the beasts were stabled. 

The landlady looked amazed. 

" Monsieur is not going ? But it is 
not possible! Monsieur 

"Look here, madame," said Sir 
Claude, sitting down by the little 
table, on which, by the lamp, was al- 
ready set the bottle of wine which 
he had promised to drink when he 
returned from the village. "Look/ 
here you've been telling me about // 
the Arabs! I don't know them.^ 
I'm a stranger here. I come 
England, where you can take a man's 
word, and trust 





pretty nearly anywhere without being r 
afraid of their being insulted. Now p 
you tell me! Sit down, madame!" 

The landlady sat down opposite to 
him. The nickering light from the 
.jlamp fell across her wrinkled, in- 
telligent face, and brightened the 
eyes which were fixed intently upon 
her guest. 

" And you tell me ! I've got a wife, 
madame, a little thing, young, a girl 
almost she is, and about the prettiest 
woman in England. I've got her out 
here in Africa." 

"Where is she, monsieur?" 

"At the inn at El-Akbara. This 
chap, this Benchaalal, is there. I've 
seen him. I saw the damned fellow 
the first night we got there. Now, 
what should he be staying on day 
after day for, instead of going to his 
home, to his damned mud hut in the 
desert? And why should Achmed 
deny to you that he was there, and 



104 



1\ 



^ 

w 
\ 



pretend to me that he had never 
heard of him, till I showed that I 
knew ? And why should Achmed get 
me away from the inn every day, and 
persuade me to-night to be here, 
leaving my wife alone among a lot of 
scoundrels ? Don't you think there's 
something up, madame ? Don't you 
think, if you were me, you'd get back 
to your wife yes, get back to her 
even if the mules hadn't six legs to 
go upon between them?" 

He struck his big hand upon the 
table and made the bottle jump and 
the lamp sway and shiver. The land- 
lady pursed her lips, put up the mid- 
die finger of her right hand to her 
chin and took it away again. 

"So," she said, after a pause. "So 
Benchaalal is at El-Akbara! I 
thought as much." 

"Why?" said Sir Claude, sharply. 

Everything made him uneasy and 
suspicious to-night. 




"Something in Achmed's manner 
when I asked him and he denied it. 
And yet he lies well, like all the 
Arabs. But there was a something, 
Sidi. He didn't want to talk of 
Benchaalal." 

Sir Claude leaned over the table 
towards her. 

" You think there's something up ?" 

" Monsieur, how can I know ? But 
one thing I know is this if I had a 
wife, and she was pretty and young, 
I would not leave her alone with 
Benchaalal near her, no, not for five 
minutes." 

Sir Claude got up and turned tow- 
ards the doorway. 

"Achmedl" he roared. "Venez! 
Depechez vous!" 

"Voila! Voila!" called a voice in 
I the distance. 

"Mind you, madame," said Sir 
Claude, turning again to the land- 
lady. "My wife would as soon think 



of tryin' to fly as of havin' anything 
to do with one of these damned blacks. 
As a friend, I mean as a guide, of 
course! What are you smilin' at?" 

" Nothing, m'sieu. I was not smil- 
ing. Monsieur was deceived by the 
lamplight. There's a wind getting 
up." 

She moved the lamp and placed it 
so that her face was in shadow. Sir 
Claude grunted. He felt sure he had 
seen an ugly smile cross the woman's 
face, and suddenly he regretted that 
he had established a sort of intimacy 
with this stranger. He had been too 
impulsive. But she was a European 
and a woman, and then it was from 
her that all these suspicions had come 
to knock upon the door of his mind. 

" Kindly give me the bill, madame, ' ' 
he said, stiffly. "And put down that 
bottle of wine and the room for the 
night. I'll pay, of course, as if I 

stayed." 

107 





"Monsieur is too good." 

She went softly in-doors. And as 
soon as her back was turned she 
smiled again to herself. 

" Mon Dieu !" she thought. " These 
men! These men with the prettiest 
wives in the world! What babies 
they are ! What babies ! Que diable ! ' ' 

She sat down by the light of a 
tallow candle at her greasy table, 
and made out a good, stiff bill for the 
baby to pay. 

Achmed was a long time getting the 
mules, but at last he was ready, the 
account was settled, and Sir Claude 
was in the saddle, his gun slung be- 
side him and his revolver ready to his 
hand. 

"Bon soir, madame," he said, 
gruffly. 

"Bon soir, m'sieu. Bon voyage." 

He rode away into the desert. 
jAchmed prepared to follow, mounted 
,on the second mule, and leading a 



108 





third which carried the dead gazell 
and Barbary sheep. 

"Bon soir, Monsieur Achmed!" 
said the landlady, with an ironical 
emphasis on the "Monsieur." "Bon 
voyage!" 

The guide turned his eye upon her. 

"Cochon femme!" he hissed at her. 
"Chamelle! chamelle!" 

He spat at her, kicked the mule 
furiously with his heels, and cantered 
away. 

"Sale race!" ejaculated the land- 
lady. 

She blew out the lamp, picked up 
the full wine bottle, tucked it under 
her arm, turned and went into the 
auberge, closing the door behind her. 

A moment later there was the 
clang of the great bar of palm-wood 
falling into its iron socket.

IX 

THAT was a long and weary 
journey by the light of the 
moon. At first Sir Claude kept in 
front, but presently he got off the 
track, and Achmed was obliged to 
ride up and go ahead to show the 
way. He passed Sir Claude morosely, 
without looking at him, and took the 
lead. On and on they went, always 
towards the dark range of mountains 
that showed where the desert ended. 
Sir Claude kept his eyes fixed upon it. 
The mules went slowly. Poor beasts, 
they were really tired and needed a 
night's rest. Like most Englishmen, 
Sir Claude was solicitous for all 



animals that did him service. And 
more than once his conscience prick- 
ed him as he encouraged his mule 
with voice and hand. Achmed did 
not care. The mules were not his, 
and no thought of an animal's suf- 
fering pained his imagination. 

Presently he began to sing in a 
whining, plaintive voice. His sulki- 
ness was subsiding as his active, 
greedy mind began to work, helped 
by the monotonous motion across the 
plain. The stranger, the rich Eng- 
lishman, had offered him one hun- 
dred francs to do the very thing he 
was now doing. And he had refused 
them. But he had refused them be- 
cause he had also refused to make 
this moonlight flitting. Well, but/ 
now he was making it. 



" Khali Targa! Khali Targa! 
Give me the scorpion that I may eat! 
See I am kneeling at thy feet. 





, To the sand, to the sand I have bowed? 

my head, i: 

In the fire have I stood, in the fire that j 

is red. 
I Khali Targa! Khali Targa!" 

Was he making it for nothing? 
This thought disgusted him. While 
he sang he was planning a campaign, 
and in the planning his fury was evap- 
orating. 

"Khali Targa! Khali Targa! 
Give me the glass that I may eat! 
See I am crouching at thy feet. 
In my belly the living scorpion lies, 
In my heart the fierce lust for paradise 
Khali Targa! Khali Targa!" 

Never yet had Achmed been " best- 
ed" by a Roumi. The mere thought 
of such a catastrophe stirred all his 
faculties. Since he had been obliged 
to undertake this journey, he must be 
well paid for it. The Roumi should 
be his prey, the Roumi who had mis- 
called him, who had forced him to 




play false to one of his own creed, to 
one of his own people. 

"Khali Targa! Khali Targa! 
Give me the knife that my flesh desires, 
As it longed for the licking tongues of the 

fires. 
The glass with the scorpion has gone to 

rest; 

Give the curving knife to my naked breast. 
Khali Targa! Khali Targa!" 

"Achmed!" 

Sir Claude's voice shouted from 
behind. Achmed stopped his sing- 
ing and turned half round upon his 
mule. 

"Sidi?" he said, politely. 

"If you don't want to drive me 
mad, stop that cursed whining!" 

"As monsieur wishes!" 

He pulled in his mule and Sir 
Claude came up with him. 

"What the devil were you singing 
about?" 

"Monsieur, I was singing the song 




The 
cruel 



of the Aissaoui, they who stand in the 
fire and eat scorpions and glass, and 
drive in the steel behind their eyes, 
and are carried with their naked 
breasts upon sharp knives." 

Sir Claude twisted his body in a 
sort of heavy shudder. 

' ' Cheerful I" he ejaculated. ' ' How 
long shall we be?" 

"Monsieur, I cannot tell, 
mules are weary. This is a 
journey." 

He sighed, keenly regarding Sir 
'Claude with his one eye. 

Never before, after hunting all 
day, have I been made to travel 
'all the night." 

Sir Claude's mule stumbled. 

"Hold up!" he cried, in English. 

He felt a certain compunction. 

"It's your own fault!" he growled. 

"My fault, monsieur?" 

Achmed's voice quivered with in- 
nocent astonishment. 




"Well, if it isn't " 

Sir Claude broke off. After all, he 
did not know anything. He was 
only suspicious. And it seemed to 
him impossible either to confirm or 
to destroy his suspicions at present. 
For how could he question Achmed 
without showing that he was anxious 
for his wife's safety ? And how could 
he let a "damned black" know that 
he had ever, in his thoughts, connect- 
ed her beauty and purity with the 
desires of a Spahi ? 

"You shouldn't have put me up to 
this expedition," he said. 

"I thought monsieur had never 
shot gazelle." 

"No more I had. And what of 
that?" 

"All the English gentlemen who 
come to El-Akbara want to shoot 
gazelle." 

Sir Claude began to wonder whether ( 
he had wronged the guide. Now that 

"S 






the old Frenchwoman's influence was 
removed, he felt less suspicious. It 
was she who had alarmed him by her 
diatribes against the Arabs. Perhaps 
she was a silly old woman, an alarm- 
ist, even a liar. But then Achmed 
had lied about this Benchaalal. 

"Monsieur promised me " 

It was Achmed's voice with its 
most insinuating intonation. 

"Eh?" 

"Monsieur promised me a hundred 
francs if I protected him through the 
night to El-Akbara." 

"Protected!" 

Sir Claude laughed. 

"Showed me the way, you mean." 

"As monsieur chooses. Monsieur 
will keep his word?" 

"Well, of all the cheek!" 

Sir Claude had dropped into English. 

"Monsieur says 'of course.' He is 
right. All the English keep their 
a promises. They are a great nation." 

116 







' ' I never promised you a hundred 
francs, but 

"Yes, monsieur?" 

"No, I can't bribe the feller!" 
Sir Claude thought. But then again 
came to him the fierce desire to know 
"II whether Achmed and this Spahi, this 
Benchaalal, had plotted together to 
get him out of the way. 

"Two hundred francs would be 
nothing to me if I got hold of a 
devoted fellow, of a fellow who'd 
never tell me a lie or play me a dirty 
trick," he said, almost against his will. 

Achmed 's eye brightened. The 
flame of avarice shot up in it. But 
he was subtle, and only replied care- 
lessly : 

"The good master makes the good 
servant." 

"And Benchaalal? Is he a good 
master?" asked Sir Claude. 

" Monsieur, Benchaalal is generous 
to those who serve him they say." 




"7 




"And to you? Is he generous to 
you?" 

" Monsieur, I am not the servant of 
Benchaalal." 

"What? Have you never gone 
hunting with him?" 

"Oh yes, monsieur. And when 
Benchaalal hunts he pays well. But 
he pays afterwards." 

There was or so Sir Claude thought 
a strong significance in Achmed's 
voice as he said the last words. His 
blood grew hot. He longed to strike 
the guide, to knock him off his mule 
with a straight blow from the shoulder 
and to see him roll over in the sand. 

" No," he thought to himself, " I'm 
damned if I can have anything to do 
with the feller. I'll shift for myself. 
To-morrow I'll take Kitty away to 
Beni-Mora. She'll be glad to go. 
She wanted to go before. I've been 
a selfish beast, but there can't be any 
harm done, even if that beastly black 

118 



has been up to some devilry with 
Achmed." 

And Achmed could get nothing 
more out of him. To all the Arab's 
insinuating remarks he returned gruff 
monosyllabic replies, and at last they 
rode on, hour after hour, in complete 
silence, coming ever nearer to the 
black wall of mountains that was 
their destination. 

It was towards dawn when the 
mules set their feet upon the firm, 
well-made road that leads to the three 
villages of the oasis of El-Akbara. 
The moon was waning, the wind at 
their backs was colder, and Sir Claude, 
strong though he was, felt an unusual 
sense of fatigue laying hold of him, 
an unusual depression, no doubt pure- 
ly physical, stealing upon his spirit, 
almost like a stealthy tide, frigid and/ ^ 
sadly murmuring. 

"It's a devil of a ride," he said to 
himself. 





Then he tried to pull himself to- 
\ gether, staring towards the rocky 
^ rampart now close at hand, and fix- : 
y ing his thoughts on the cosey inn, the ' 
comfortable bed, the long sleep that 
awaited him. And then Kitty ! Soon 
he would see her. He pictured him- 
self stealing into her room, shading 
the candle with his hand, and looking 
down on her slight form, her pretty, 
fair head with the yellow hair spread 
out over the pillow. 

He bent his long legs backward 
and struck his tired mule with his 
heels. The poor brute, whose trip- 
ping walk had long since degenerated 
into an uneasy shamble, started for- 
ward in a sort of convulsive canter, 
and passed Achmed, who was hunch- 
ed up and seemed to have fallen 
asleep shrouded in his burnous with 
the hood drawn closely round his face. 
But the canter only lasted a moment. 
The animal was nearly dead beat, 



like its rider, and subsided almost at 
once into its former tragic pace. 

As Sir Claude passed him, Achmed's 
one eye peered sharply forth from the 
shadow of the hood, and when his 
master's mule ceased from cantering, 
the guide sat up on his pack-saddle 
and threw off his elaborate pretence 
of sleep. He had a knife hidden 
under his burnous, and now he laid 
his hand upon.it, looking steadily at 
the hind -legs of the mule in front. 
He wanted to get into El-Akbara 
before Sir Claude, and he was con- 
sidering how to accomplish this with- 
\out waking suspicion in the Roumi. 
The failure of his attempt to whee- 
dle his employer into parting with 
the hundred francs he longed for ir- 
^_ ritated him, almost infuriated him. 
~-~-\ He knew that he would not get the 
money, and he hated Sir Claude as 
an Arab hates the man always who 
i.%s= baffles his greed. Presently he drew 




his knife from its sheath of goat-skin, 
slipped softly from his mule, and 
stealthily approached Sir Claude's, 
keeping his eye fixed warily on its 
rider. He did not act at once, but 
walked for two or three minutes 
noiselessly as a ghost at the tail of 
the mule, till he felt certain he could 
do his deed unobserved. Then he 
bent down, still keeping up with the 

L beast, the hand with the knife in it 
hung for a second above the sham- 
^bling, hairy legs, came nearer to them, 
came close to them. 
"Achmed!" 
Sir Claude had turned. 
"Achmed! What the devil?" 
"Stop, monsieur! There is a stone 
in his hoof. Let me get it out." 

Sir Claude pulled up, startled. In- 
^stantly the Arab lifted one of the 
mule's hoofs from the road and with 
the knife pretended to extract a 
stone, holding one, snatched from 



the road, up a second later, then 
flinging it away. 

"I saw he was going lame, mon- 
sieur. C'est ca!" 

Calmly he returned his knife to its 
sheath. 

"I didn't notice anything." 

Sir Claude was looking at him with 
keen suspicion. 

" Monsieur, I was behind. I could 
see." 

"I thought you were asleep." 

"The Arab does not sleep when he 
is protecting his master." 

Sir Claude grunted. 

" Now you get in front again." 

"As monsieur pleases." 

Achmed jumped again onto his 
mule, and began to lead the way once 
more, letting the led mule run free 
with its load of gazelle and Barbary 
sheep. 

Foiled in his attempt to lame Sir 
Claude's beast, and get away before 




Sir Claude had time to notice the 
accident and call him back, he urged 
his mule on as fast as possible, and 
again began to sing at the top of his 
voice. 

"Khali Targa! Khali Targa! 

On the curving edge of the steel I have 
lain, 

I have feared not the touch of the flicker- 
ing pain; 

Nor the sharp - toothed glass, nor the 
poisoned sting 

Now the lash, the lash to my bared loins 

bring! 
Khali Targa! Khali Targa!" 

This time Sir Claude did not in- 
terrupt him. For the three villages 
were at hand, houses of shadow kept 
by trees of shadow, the river, flowing 
out of the gorge into the desert, 
lifted its murmur to their ears, the 
neared its end. And does 
"the weary traveller, as he rides 
from the darkness of the waste, 
, instinctively raise his voice in a song, 




, 



or in a cry to hail the friends, 
joys that await him ? 

Louder and louder Achmed sang. 
His "Khali Targa!" went out to the 
frowning masses of the towering rocks 
and was echoed back by them. It came 
from the desert as a shout of warning 
to two night wanderers who, close 
the place where, by day, the little Arab 
sat in the sun and played his capricious 
tune, were waiting to see the coming 
of the dawn over the sandy waste. 

The Spahi moved as the distant 
cry first came to his ears. 

"Is it the Marabout?" whispered 

H, 9 Lady Wyverne, laying her hand on 

ffil his cloak. 

P\l "Hush!" 

^ He listened, leaning forward tow- 

j| ards the desert. 

"Khali Targa! Khali Targa! 
vxl More hard than the rocks where the falcon 
5 flies 

Is the way to the Prophet's Paradise " 

"S 










" It is the voice of Achmed!" 
Lady Wyverne turned white. 
" But it can't be ! Why, they are 

at the salt mountain, far away from 

here!" 

The lash on my loins has fallen like hail. 

See ! I offer my shaven head to the nail ! 

Khali Targa! Khali Targa!" 

"It is Achmed! They are coming! 
Look! I see mules on the road!" 

"Save me! Where am I to go?" 

She sprang up wildly. 

But he drew her down again. 

"You can't get away now." 

"But I must! I must be in the 
inn when my husband gets there. 
He'll go straight to my room!" 

She struggled with him and began 
to sob hysterically. 

"Be quiet! Keep still!" 

He said it quite gently. Yet she 
stopped at once and remained mo- 
tionless, silent as one under the in- 

R: fluence of an opiate. 
126 



"You can't get back. There's 
only one thing slip behind the rock! 
Crouch down ! I will let my burnous 
drop over you!" 

Lady Wyverne crept to the back 
of the rock on which they had been 
seated and obeyed him. He lifted 
his great burnous, and replaced it 
loosely on his shoulders, letting it fall 
so that it concealed Lady Wyverne 's 
head and shoulders. Her face was 
pressed against his back and his body 
felt her troubled breathing. Then he 
lit a cigarette. His attitude was 
nonchalant. His dark, keen face 
was perfectly calm. He drew the 
cigarette smoke into his throat and 
let it out rhythmically through his 
nostrils, quietly watching the mules 
as they came nearer and nearer. ^ 
In his long eyes there was the him 
of an almost sleepy smile. 

Achmed's song had died away now 
and Benchaalal knew that the guide's)^ 





keen sight had already discovered 
him, that the guide's swift intelli-f 
gence had gathered from his motion- j 
,* w less attitude that the singing had' 
been heard and that he was pre- 
pared for their coming. 

Achmed's mule came" up level with 
the Spahi and passed on. Achmed 
made no sign of recognition, but he 
looked at Benchaalal steadily, then 
beyond him as if seeking for some- 
thing. Benchaalal leaned a little 
backward, letting his burnous drop 
lower over the crouching woman. 
And he felt that she shuddered 
against his body. The mule that 
bore the victims of Sir Claude's gun 
followed. Then came Sir Claude. 
As he drew up the first rays of the 
rising sun struck into the eastern 
sky and touched the houses of the 
red village upon its little hill. When 
Sir Claude saw the Spahi he started 
with surprise, and involuntarily pull- 



128 



ed up his mule. For a moment the 
two men stared at each other; the 
Englishman with a sort of hard in- 
quiry and suspicion, the Arab with 
a sleepy languor that told nothing 
of what was passing in his mind. Al- 
ways he drew the cigarette smoke 
into his throat, and let it out through 
his finely cut nostrils. 

"Bonjour," said Sir Claude, at 
last, in the rough voice of a weary 
man. 

"Bonjour, monsieur," said the 
Spahi, softly. "You have had good 
sport, I see." 

\The crouching woman was trem- 
bling violently. Benchaalal leaned 
still farther back. He feared lest 
the rider should see the movement 
=r_ of the folds of his burnous, and 
B55 ^ w secretly cursed the timidity of women. 
"You are out early, monsieur," 
_ said Sir Claude. 

"We Spahis are accustomed to 




r 




early rising, monsieur. I seldom 
sleep much after three o'clock. I like 
to see the sun come up over the 
desert." 

He thought he saw Sir Claude's 
steady, strained eyes glance back- 
ward as Achmed's had done. But 
he was not sure. The smoke wreaths 
of his cigarette, curling up towards 
the pale sky, in which the last stars 
had not yet faded, might have tricked 
his acute vision. 

There was a moment of silence. 
Sir Claude lifted his right hand, laid 
it down on the mule's neck, and 
moved as if he were about to dis- 
mount. Then he seemed to change 
his mind, for he suddenly struck the 
animal with his heels, set his lips to- 
gether, and rode on without another 
| word. The patter of hoofs on the 
hard road made a diminuendo. 

"Don't move!" whispered the 
Spahi, without stirring. 



The patter of hoofs died quite away. 

"Not yet!" he said, aloud. "Not 
till I tell you." 

He heard again the sound of con- 
vulsive, half-strangled sobbing. Yet 
even now his face did not change, 
even now he continued quietly to 
smoke. 

The gorge took the little cavalcade. 
It was lost in the fastnesses of the 
rocks. Then the Spahi sprang up, 
lifted his cloak, and set free the 
terrified woman. 

" Does he know ? Did he see me ?" 

She could scarcely get the words 
out. Her face was stained with 
tears and flushed with red in patches. 

"Who can tell?" 

"He'll go to my room! Oh, God, 
he'll go to my room!" 

"Who can tell? He is tired, 
sits like a sack on the mule." 

"He'll go! What am I to do? 
What am I to do?" 




Benchaalal stretched his arm out 
towards the spaces of the desert. 

"Will you come with me there?" 

"He'll find my room empty! He'll 
come back!" 

The Spahi looked at her for a 
moment. Then he said, coldly: 

"Go and wash your face in the 
river, madame. And then we can 
speak together. At present it is use- 
less." 

Lady Wyverne stared for a mo- 
ment, as if she did not comprehend 
what he had said. But the tears 
dried on her cheeks. And after an 
instant she turned from him obe- 
diently, went to the river-bank, and 
bent down over the running water. 






X 



THE sun was up, bathing the 
desert in its beams, but the 
gorge of El - Akbara was still in 
shadow when Lady Wyverne, alone, 
stole along the road by the Judas- 
trees, passed through the gateway 
in the wooden fence, and entered the 
court-yard of the inn. She was very 
pale, and looked furtively around 
her, then upward swiftly to the win- 
dow of her husband's bedroom. It 
was shut and the green persiennes 
hid the glass. She crossed the court- 
yard quickly and tried the front door. 
The handle of it seemed to her to 
turn almost of itself. She under- 
stood why when, as she pushed the 

133 






door back, she saw Achmed standing 
in the aperture. He stared at her 
with his one eye, but said noth- 
ing, and she hurried past him soft- 
ly, up the stairs, and into her bed- 
room. 

She had dreaded finding Sir Claude 
there. But there was no one. She 
gently locked the door and sat down 
on the little chair by the bed. 

Had her husband visited her room 
or not? 

That was the vital question she was 
asking herself. He must have been 
terribly tired by his long ride across 
the desert and the day's hunting. 
He must have been longing to sleep. 
Nevertheless, knowing him as she did, 
she felt almost certain that he would 
not have gone to bed without trying 
her door. And she had left it un- 
locked when she went out to see the. 
sunrise with Benchaalal. She had 
been reckless, feeling perfectly safe 



in the thought that Sir Claude was 
miles away. 

Why had he come back ? 

Mechanically she began to undress. 
Her hands trembled, and she was not 
accustomed to undressing herself ; but 
at last she was ready for bed, and 
she stepped in and drew the clothes 
up to her chin. 

Why had he come back? It was 
his own idea to stay away all night. 
She had never suggested such a 
thing, had never even thought of it. 
When she had read the note telling 
her he was going to sleep out, she had 
been full of a sort of ironical pity for 
his folly, for his short-sightedness. 

And now he had come back, travel- 
ling through the night. / 

She could not understand it. // 

Presently, as she lay quietly there, ^ 
and her husband did not come, and, 
she heard no movement in his room, Ij 
she began to think that perhaps in; 





her terror she had been unreasonable, r 
She had lost her head, or nearly lost j^^ 
it. But for the self-possession of the ? * 
Spahi she would certainly have been' 
discovered by her husband. 

And if she had been discovered ? 

She tried to think of the situation 
calmly, without hysteria. If she had 
been discovered what would " Crum- 
pet" have said, have done? If he 
knew anything now, what would he 
say or do ? 

She had always been accustomed 
to rule him. He had always given 
in to all her whims. They had often 
been foolish, but they had been inno- 
cent. She had flirted. Many men had 
made a sort of love to her. But it had 
been a very tame business. It had not 
been even a playing with fire. There 
had never been any fire to play with. 

But where Benchaalal was there 
was fire, there was always fire. 

Sir Claude had never minded her 
136 




little flirtations. But he had felt sure 
of her. Somehow Lady Wyverne, 
never having really cared a straw for 
any of the men who had admired her, 
had never dreamed that Sir Claude 
could mind their attentions, even 
their occasional ardor. The ardor 
had always been English, and her 
own consciousness of her own cold- 
ness had preserved her from either 
fear or any sense of guilt. 

But now she was afraid, both of 
herself and of her husband. And 
she felt guilty, not because of any 
evil act that she had committed, but 
because of thoughts that had passed 
through her mind, of feelings that 
had stirred in her heart. 

She knew her husband through 
and through, and she knew his in- 
tensely English nature. All, or near- 
ly all, the prejudices of the average 
Englishman were his, cherished chil- 
sfe--. dren of his not clever brain. 





She divined how Sir Claude would 
inevitably think of Africans. Very 
much as the average American re- 
gards the nigger he would regard any 
African; whether Egyptian, Touareg, 
Kabyle, Arab, Negro, or Moor. They 
would be all the same to him 
' ' blacks , " or " damned blacks . " Thus 
he would sum them up. The idea 
that his wife could enter into any 
close friendly relations with one of 
them, could flirt with one of them, 
kcould allow one of them openly to 
f> admire her, even to make love to 
her, would never occur to him. But 
if it were forced upon him; if it were 
proved to him that his wife had 
walked with an Arab at night, had 
allowed him to admire her, had ad- 
mired him, found him interesting, 
even more fascinating, strangely at- 
tractive! What then? 

Suddenly Lady Wyverne saw her 

husband in a new light, saw un- 
138 



chained in him a new being. The 
Englishman is often slow to wake up, 
but when he does wake up he is not a 
man to trifle with. And Sir Claude 
was very primitive. At certain junc- 
tures in life the primitive man is the 
most dangerous, the most terrible of 
all men. He rushes ahead with the 
blindness of a machine. 

Lady Wyverne shuddered in her 
bed. 

But then she told herself that Sir 
Claude did not know. If he had 
known he would have come out of ^ 
the hotel to seek her, or he would 
have been waiting in her room to 
denounce her. 

But why had he come back? 

His return made her think that he 
must have some suspicion, that some- 
thing must have occurred to take his 
mind from Barbary sheep and fix it 
upon a different subject. 

She lay still for a long time. Pres- 




ently she heard voices below. The 
Arab servants were about. Despite 
her closed shutters she realized that 
the sun-rays had reached the gorge. 
The day was come, the full day. 
And she must face it. 

She looked at her watch. Eight 
o'clock. She got up, rang for hot 
water. 

An Arab left it at her door with a 
loud single knock. When he had 
gone she opened the door and took 
it in. Her husband's door was shut. 
Was he in the hotel, or, having found 
her room empty, was he out seeking 
her? 

She wondered. She longed vehe- 
mently to know. 

When she was dressed she made a 
strong mental effort, opened the win- 
dow, and stepped out onto the ve- 
^randa. As she did so her husband 
issued from his room and met her. 

"Crumpet!" she cried out. 






Her movement of surprise was 
natural. She was really surprised, 
startled. She caught hold of the 
balustrade and steadied herself. 

"You are back!" 

"Yes, "he said. 

" But you told me you were going 
to sleep out ! Where was it ? At some 
place or other where there's gazelle. "[HH 

"I know. But the inn was so 
beastly that I came back." 

"When?" 

"I rode pretty near all night. I 
got in at dawn." 

"I I didn't hear the mules." 
Ill She tried to speak naturally and 
18 HI believed that she succeeded. But 
her eyes were fastened on her hus- 
band's face with an intense scrutiny. 

"You must have been sound 
asleep," he replied. 

"Yes, I must have been sound 
asleep." 

"Let's have breakfast," he said. 



X 0*. 






So he had not been to her room! 
For a moment her sense of relief was 
immense. She went nearer to him, 
intending to give him a kiss. But he 
happened to turn round just at the 
moment to look for one of the straw 
chairs they always sat in when they 
took breakfast or tea on the veranda. 
Evidently he had not noticed her 
movement. Or had he seen it and 
wished to ? 

He found the chair, then leaned 
iover the balustrade and shouted for 
breakfast. 

"Are you tired?" Lady Wyverne 
said. 

"Yes, a bit." 

He tipped his chair back till two 
legs were off the floor, then let them 
drop, then tipped the chair back 
again. 

"It was a longish ride." 

"I I wonder you didn't stay at 

the inn." 

149 



"It was beastly dirty." 

She forced a laugh. Something in 
his manner made her uneasy. And 
then he had not kissed her. Nor 
had he once pronounced her name- 
Kitty. Generally it, or its abbrevia- 
tion, "Kit," was forever on his lips. 

" I didn't know you were afraid of 
roughing it," she said. 

"Well, I don't see the good of 
being uncomfortable when one can 
be comfortable." 

There was a pause. 

"No, of course not," she said. 

He was still tipping the chair to 
and fro. The movement irritated 
her nerves. She looked away. 

"Oh, here's breakfast!" she ex- 
claimed. 

The Arab who brought it was the/ 
same sleepy - looking boy who h 
accompanied Lady Wyverne on her 
excursion to the red village. He ar- 
ranged the breakfast carefully and 






t gently, but very slowly, upon the : 
wicker tables. Sir Claude watched i 
him with an air of acute irritability 
' that was almost like active hatred. ' 

"What's the matter?" asked his 
_ wife. 

" These infernal blacks ' ' he began. 
"There! There! That '11 do." 

He suddenly leaned forward and 
pushed the boy roughly away from 
the table. The boy started, cast an 
angry look at him, and went off 
muttering to himself. 

"I can't stand these fellers! Ver- 
min!" said Sir Claude, with a sort of 
irrepressible passion. 

Lady Wyverne said nothing. It 
was the first time her husband had 
ever behaved like this in her presence. 
She wondered whether he was only 
over -tired or whether there was an- 
other reason for his unusual conduct. 
His outburst against the Arabs made 

her tremble again at the thought of 
144 



her imprudence. She felt that the 
knowledge that his wife had coquet- 
ted to use no other word with an 
Arab surreptitiously would let loose 
upon her a new man, a man whom 
she had never known and of whom 
she would be terrified. But he could 
know nothing. If he did he would 
have spoken, have acted at once. 
"Crumpet" might be violent, even 
terrible. She realized that now. But 
surely he could never be subtle. 

And yet she could not quite rid 
herself of uneasiness, of doubt. He 
had not kissed her. He had not yet 
called her by her name. And there 
was surely something aloof in his 
manner, a detachment from her that 
\vas unusual. 

"What about to-day?" she asked, 

'"%. making a strong effort to seem lively 

and cheerful. "Are we going on to 

Beni-Mora?" 

,^g^ He busied himself with an egg, 




carefully chipping the shell away from 
the white. 

" D' you want to go ?" he asked. " I 
wonder if this egg's fresh." 

"Oh, they always are here!" 

" Dessay it's all right. D' you want 
to go?" 

"Well, I" she shot a glance at 
him "I don't mind. But haven't 
you had enough of Barbary sheep by 
this time?" 

" If you're bored to death we'll go, 

t if not I think I should like to 
have just one more shot at some- 
thing." 

He spoke very deliberately, with a 
certain dull heaviness. 

"Yes, the egg's all right," he add- 
ed, tasting it. 

" Very well. But you're surely go- 
&ing to have a rest to-day." 

" Yes. I may go out towards sun- 
set." 

|| "Is that a good time?" 

146 



"I may sleep out." 

Lady Wyverne started. 

"Well, but if you can't stand the 
inns!" 

"I may take a tent. They've got 
one here." 

"Oh won't it be cold?" 

" Take plenty of blankets and you're 
all right." 

"Very well," she said. 

After some minutes, during which 
he ate and she pretended to eat in 
silence, Sir Claude said: 

" You're not bored, are you ? You 
don't still want to get away?" 

"I really don't care what I do," 
she replied, carelessly, " so long as we 
don't settle down here forever." 

"We won't do that," he said. 

They had finished now, and he got 
up and lit a cigar. As he did so 
Benchaalal came out from the inn 
door underneath the veranda, walk- ; 

ed slowly across the court and down 

147 




the road towards the desert. He had 
on his scarlet cloak, which floated out 
majestically as he walked. He did 
not glance up at them. His dark 
face was very calm and tranquil, and 
he looked like a man perfectly con- 
tented with himself and all the world. 
Lady Wyverne only glanced at him, 
but Sir Claude watched him until he 
was lost to sight at a bend in the 
road. 

"That's a fine looking chap!" he 
said. 

" I think the Arabs are a handsome 
set," Lady Wyverne answered. 

" But he's the most striking of the 
lot. Don't you think so?" 

"Is he? I dare say." 

Instinctively she had replied eva- 
sively, with an elaborate carelessness. 
Scarcely had she done so, however, 
rwhen it occurred to her that it would 
mave been more subtle, more really 

clever, to have agreed with him 
148 





heartily. She was always accustom 
ed to speak her thoughts, to express 
her whims frankly before Crumpet. 
She had often openly raved to him 
about other men's looks. It would 
have seemed far more natural, far 
more like herself, to do so now. But 
it was too late. Besides, she could 
not. 

" I spoke to the feller this morning," 
resumed Sir Claude, leaning on the 
balustrade in an easy attitude and 
puffing wreaths of smoke away into 
the sun. 

"This morning!" Lady Wyverne 
exclaimed, with a careful intonation 
of astonishment. "When?" 

Sir Claude took his cigar from his 
mouth and smoothed the leaf at the 
end with his finger. 

"When I was riding in." 

"He he was up already at that 
hour?" 

She felt like an actress at a re- 






ft 

hearsal, and wondered if she had got 
her tone just right. 

"He was out in the desert, sitting 
on a rock near the river. You know 
that rock where we heard that boy 
playing the first day." 

"Oh yes. What an extraordinary 
man! What was he doing there? 
Meditating on eternity!" 

She gave a little, high-pitched laugh. 

" I don't know what he was doing. 
He was just sitting there wrapped up 
in one of those big cloaks. You know 
the things?" 

"Yes I know." 

"We had a few words together. 
He seems a decent sort of chap." 

At this moment a sudden impulse 
seized Lady Wyverne to tell her hus- 
band not all, certainly not that, 
but something ; that she had spoken 
to the Spahi, that they had strolled 
together up and down in front of the 
inn once; something of that kind. 



She was in the dark. She could not 
divine whether Sir Claude knew or 
suspected something, or whether he 
was talking in complete ignorance. 
For once her husband was a puzzle 
to her, and she began to respect him. 
She began to respect him but she 
longed to read him, to make sure. 
And she longed to "play for safety," 
ingeniously. 

"Oh, I should think he must 
be quite well educated," she began. 
"He's an officer. At least, I think 
some one said so, didn't they?" 

"Ah." 

That was all Sir Claude said in 
reply, but it made Lady Wyverne 
abruptly aware that she could not 
tell him anything. It was impossible. 
He would never understand. She said // 
to herself that he certainly knew noth-6 #5 
ing, suspected nothing. She would be a/Jjl 
fool to ' ' give herself away. ' ' Crumpet jj 
never saw anything unless it was shown | 





to him. It was all right. Only her!" 
own stupid nerves had made her , s 
? think that possibly, for once, he was i 
?j* being subtle, even crafty with her, * 
that he was playing with her, testing 
her. 

"Well, what are you going to do 
this morning?" she exclaimed, brisk- 
ly, getting up from her chair. 

" I shall go down and see about the 
tent for to-night." 

"Then you've quite decided 
now?" 

"Yes," he said. "I've quite de- 
cided now." 

" Very well. I'll go and write some 
letters." 

She went away to her room. When 
she was there she heard her husband's 
heavy footstep descending the wooden 
staircase. 

And she had an odd fancy that 
it sounded much heavier than 

usual. 

152 



But of course he was tired after 
being up all night. 

All the morning Lady Wyverne 
wrote, or pretended to write, letters. 
She lunched alone. Sir Claude had 
gone up to his room to have a good 
sleep, and had given orders that he 
was not to be disturbed. In the 
afternoon she sat alone on the ve- 
randa reading a novel. She had not 
seen Benchaalal again. But she had 
seen Achmed go down the road 
towards the villages. He returned 
about half -past one, and at half-past 
two Sir Claude emerged from his 

\room dressed for hunting. 
"Have you had a good sleep?" she 
asked. 
"I'm all right," he replied. "As 
gs- fit as a fiddle." 
^. "Are you off already?" 

"I believe so. If Achmed 's got 
everything onto the mules." 
" I must come down to see you start." 




"Oh, don't you bother. You can 
see us from up here." 

"What time will you be back to- 
morrow?" 

"I don't know. Depends on the 
sport. I shall sleep out and go after 
the sheep at dawn." 

"Good-bye, old boy," she said. 

She put her face up suddenly to his 
and kissed him. 

"Achmed!" he shouted out, harsh- 
ly. "Are you ready?" 

Voila ! Voila ! ' ' came a voice from 
below. 

"Good-bye," Sir Claude said to his 
wife. 

He turned and went down the 
stairs. 

Two or three minutes later she saw 
him ride away with quite a little 
r cavalcade of laden mules, and with 
three Arabs, including Achmed. 

They went to the left, away from 
Ifthe desert. 



Sir Claude and Achmed rode side 
by side behind the others. 

They seemed to be talking togeth- 
er with some animation doubtless 
about Barbary sheep. 




XI 



AMONG the palm-trees near the 
red village that day there had 
been a violent scene between Ben- 
chaalal and Achmed. The guide was 
in the Spahi's pay, and had been 
promised a sum of money if he would 
persuade Sir Claude to spend a night 
at the salt mountain. 

This sum of money Benchaalal had 
refused to give him. The abrupt 
return of Sir Claude and the guide 
had infuriated the Spahi, despite his 
seeming composure during the inter- 
view by the river at dawn. He knew 
;how delicately balanced are the emo- 
Itions of such women as Lady Wyv- 

erne; creatures of caprice, highly 
156 






strung, changeable, slaves of 
nerves. Carefully, cleverly, he had 
been creating about her a certain 
atmosphere, in which he moved 
against a mysterious background of 
desert, strangely, almost magically, 
touched with the romance of a bar- 
barous and brilliant world. He had 
scarcely seen her in the day. He had 
scarcely wished to see her. By night 
their acquaintance had been made, 
by night cemented. The towering 
rocks had cast upon their fugitive 
intercourse black shadows, the moon- 
beams a maze of silver. The river 
had sung to them a nocturne. The 
wind from the sands had touched 
them with its thrilling fingers. 

And the Roumi-woman had been 
enticed. 

At first she had been like a wilful 
child breaking bounds. But he had 
carried her on till the child in her, 
and its naughtiness, was merged in 




157 





B|the very curious woman ; and on again 
till the curious woman became the 
.dreaming woman, the woman with 
wonder in her eyes. Just once he 
had shown himself in sunlight, and 
that almost meretriciously; with a 
crudeness of physical strength and 
determination, with a swiftness of 
skill, with a certain fierceness that 
was akin to the blinding sunshine. 
And then again he had stepped back 
into the darkness and called again out 
||of the night. 

And the Roumi-woman had been 
drawn on, like the child by the Celes- 
tial's pigtail in the story, and had 
come very near to the hidden cham- 

Jber where the desire of her lav in 

J 

wait. 

Trampling upon this delicate fabric, 
which the Spahi had woven thread 
by thread, had come the hoofs of the 
mules. 

And Benchaalal cursed Achmed 

158 



and refused to give him a sou of the 
promised money. 

Lady Wyverne's terror was his foe. 
He felt sure of that. After the hu- 
miliation by the river's bank, when 
she had cowered for the first time in 
hiding, she would be set free from her 
dream. That was certain. Fantasy 
had been struck upon by the iron 
hammer of fact. And now the Spahi 
could not answer for the Roumi- 
woman. 

So he was furious, and he let loose 
his fury upon Achmed as only an 
Arab can. 

From their altercation Achmed 
had gone hot-foot to join Sir Claude 
on his camping-out expedition. Al- 
though not long before he had been 
livid with anger, half crazy with 
baffled greed, he was now apparent- 
ly not merely calm but lively. 
rode off beside his employer with a 
smiling face and, as Lady Wyverne 





had seen from the veranda, talking) 
busily. 

The love of money in an Arab is a 
j^ passion of the heart, of the mind, of' 
the whole being. Trick that love, dis- 
^-^,. appoint that passion, and you rouse a 
demon that is curiously subtle, that 
is persistent and revengeful, and en- 
tirely without scruple. Benchaalal 
knew that, but he had been careless 
in his fury. For a moment he had 
run mad. That moment had given 
Achmed over to Sir Claude. 

Till they rode away together that 
afternoon Sir Claude and Achmed 
had remained coldly master and ser- 
vant. The Arab had seen Benchaalal's 
burnous move when they came upon 
him by the river, and had divined the 
truth. But he had said nothing, 
showed nothing. Whether Sir Claude 
had seen what he had seen he did not 
know. They had ridden on in silence 

to the inn. At the door Sir Claude 
1 60 



had dismounted without words, and 
had gone straight up - stairs. And 
Achmed had not followed him, but 
had remained below to watch for the 
return of the Spahi, for the return, 
perhaps, of another. And he had not 
waited in vain. When Lady Wyverne 
tried the door he had been there. 
Then he had gone to the stables, had 
thrown himself down and slept. Later 
Sir Claude had told him to prepare 
for a second nocturnal expedition. 
And now they were off. 

A, i^- **** 

Did his master know? He tried to 

read him with his one eye, as he 

U talked of Barbary sheep. The hun- 

\ dred francs, spoken of near the salt 

w mountain, must be in his pocket to- 

\morrow T , those and many others, 

===_ enough to make him forget the lost 

"-- money of the Spahi. His whole 

being was alive with determination 

-s. to recoup himself. But when he 

"OtiSa looked at Sir Claude's hard face he 





knew he must be wary. For even 
the Englishman, who lets his women 
go unveiled, does not love to hear 
their names befouled by the lips of 
strangers. 

"Look here, Achmed," said Sir 
Claude, presently, "I want you to 
take me up into the mountain above 
El-Akbara to-night. The whole place 
is one mass of rocks, and full of good 
hiding-places to get a shot from." 

"But monsieur cannot shoot at 
night." 

" I didn't say I could. But I want 
to have a look at the ground. Then 
I'll come back to the camp and sleep 
for a bit, and go up again towards 
dawn." 

As he spoke he turned round on his 
mule and looked back at the mighty 
rocks that descended in giant steps 
to the road that led to the Sahara. 

" You understand ?" he added, turn- 
^ ing round again. 



162 



"Monsieur wishes to go up there, 
near the gorge?" 

Sir Claude looked sharply at the 
Arab. 

"Yes," he said, after a slight hesi- 
tation. 

"I do not know if there will be 
Barbary sheep up there." 

"I intend to find out, anyway." 

" I am the servant of monsieur. I 
will do whatever monsieur desires. 
Monsieur will be generous to me?" 

Sir Claude gnawed his mustache, 
looking down sideways at the road. 
His pride, and something else, re- 
volted against the idea of making 
the guide his confidant. But there 
was something alive and burning 
within him, something passionate, 
even furious, which seemed to be 
fighting his own nature and to be 
subduing it. 

"I shall be generous to you," he 
said, at last, without looking at the 






Arab. "If you do exactly what I 
want and don't talk." 

Achmed put his finger to his lips. 

"Monsieur has only to tell me," he 
said, softly. 

"I don't want those fellows to 
know where I'm going to-night," Sir 
Claude said. "I want the camp 
pitched a good way out, but so that I 
can get to the mountain at the left 
of the road on the edge of the desert, 
the mountain that rises out of the 
gorge, where all those rocks are." 

"And when does monsieur wish to 
be on the mountain?" 

" I wish to be there towards sunset. 
I shall take some food with me in 
case I'm back late. But the camp 
must be pitched a long way off." 

"And I am to come with monsieur 
and guide him back?" 

Sir Claude rode on for a minute or 
two without speaking. Then he an- 
swered : 





"You can come with me and wait 
for me." 

"Wait for monsieur?" 

"I'll settle where. That'll do." 

They rode on in silence. Achmed 's 
brain was working busily and his 
heart was happy. He would get 
money after all. But he was full of 
curiosity. What was the Roumi 
ing to do? What did he know or 
suspect ? 

Sir Claude did not tell him. In- 
deed, he sent Achmed on ahead, and 
rode alone till they had reached a 
desolate plateau surrounded by bare 
mountains, whose rocky crests were 
sharply defined against the clear sky, 
in which the moon hung like a ghostly 
thing as yet scarcely visible against 
the blue. Then Achmed pulled up 
and called out to him. 

"Monsieur will sleep here. This 
is a good place from which to go out 

after the sheep." 

165 





"All right," said Sir Claude. 
He swung himself off his mule, 
and walked up and down while the 
men put up the tent and picketed 
the beasts. He felt desperately lone- 
ly, almost as he had long years ago 
when he went to a public school for 
the first time, and cold cold through 
all his body. Only his head was 
burning and his temples were throb- 
bing. As he walked he stared at the 
mountains that encircled him, mon- 
I strous, cruel-looking shapes. He was 
\ not imaginative, but to-day they im- 
pressed him powerfully, almost terri- 
bly, and he remembered again go- 
ing back to his boyhood how once 
as a child he had been left alone in 
the drawing-room on a dark, wet 
day, and had turned over the leaves 
of a great, red book which contained 
pictures of the circles of hell. In 
those pictures there were mountains 
T^l like these, and hideous ravines guard- 
$ 



ed by rocks like gigantic teeth. And 
among the mountains and in the 
ravines the souls of the lost were im- 
prisoned. 

It seemed to him then that the 
little boy in the drawing-room had 
seen in the book prophetic pictures, 
and he shivered. 

The Arabs began to sing as they 
worked. One of them wailed in a 
plaintive voice for two or three min- 
utes. Then the others sang in cho- 
rus. Then the first voice wailed again 
alone. 

Presently the tent was up, and 
Achmed came to him smiling and 
carrying the guns. 

"I am ready, monsieur." 

"And the food?" 

"What will monsieur have?" 

"Anything bread and cheese and 
a bit of meat. But I'll have a drink 
before we start." 

He went over to the tent and pull- 





ed the cork out of a bottle of brandy. 
I Achmed gave him a glass. He half 
filled it, poured in some soda-water, 
,*land drank it off, while Achmed got 
the provisions. Then he poured more 
into a large silver flask, put 
it into his pocket, and mounted a 
mule. Achmed was going to walk. 
They set off together and soon lost 
sight of the camp. 

Achmed walked in front at first 
to show the way, but presently he 
dropped back and kept by the side 
of the mule. He wanted to talk, to 
satisfy his curiosity. He was not 
shy. No desert Arab is. But when 
he glanced up at Sir Claude an un- 
easiness took possession of him. The 
Roumi looked different, like a changed 
man, changed even in feature. 

It was Sir Claude who spoke first. 

"You know what I want," he said, 
roughly. " I want you to take me to 
the mountain above the gorge, to a 



1 68 




place from which I can get down 
among the rocks, get down as low as 
I like, right down if I wish to." 

"Monsieur, it is not easy." 

"That don't matter. Have you 
ever done it?" 

"Monsieur, I can go wherever a 
goat can go. But I go with naked 
feet." 

"Where you can get down, I can." 

"I will show monsieur a place. If 
monsieur goes where I show him, 
monsieur could get down to near the 
rock where Benchaalal sat when we 
passed by this morning." 

"That's it." 

" If Benchaalal should be there to- 
night, he would be surprised to see 
monsieur." 

There was a vicious sound in the 
Arab's soft voice. 

"Why should Benchaalal be there 
to-night?" said Sir Claude, fiercely. 
"What do you mean?" 





"Nothing, monsieur. Only only 
Benchaalal often goes into the desert 
by night. But monsieur is in bed- 
monsieur sleeps and does not see him 
go." 

A deep flush of red went over Sir 
Claude's brown face. He realized 
in that moment that this Arab knew 
much more, certainly, than he did. 
And yet he knew enough, surely ! He 
knew that when he returned to the 
inn his wife's room was empty. He 
knew that she crept back to the inn 
with a white, terrified face when the 
sun was up. He knew that when she 
said she must have been asleep when 
the mules came in from the desert she 
II lied to him. All this he knew. But 
now a terrible curiosity was awake in 
him with a terrible anger, a terrible 
sense of wrong, and a terrible con- 
tempt. He had felt it all day, this 
desire to know more, but he had re- 
It sisted it. And he had meant to resist 



it always. He had meant to but 
now! 

" Achmed," he said, staring straight 
before him between the mules' ears 
at the stony track. 

"Monsieur." 

"Why should why should Ben- 
chaalal go into the desert at night 
alone? What does he go for?. Has 
he friends in the village?" 

" Monsieur, he has friends. But he 
does not go to the village." 

Achmed was silent for a moment. 
Then he added, slowly: 

"And he does not go alone." 

"Whom does he go with?" said 
Sir Claude, after a pause of hesita- 
tion, and in an uncertain voice. 

"But surely monsieur knows!" 
Achmed said, innocently. " If any- 
body should know with whom Ben- 
chaalal walks at night, it would.be 
monsieur." 




" Answer my 



question, 
171 




It does not matter what I know. 
You answer my question." 

" Benchaalal walks at night with 
madame," 

"You're a damned liar!" 

Achmed said nothing. But he 
withdrew a pace or two from the 
mule. He did not look angry. Being 
called a liar did not distress him at 
all. Every human being was a liar, 
he supposed. And why not? Still, 
he had told the truth this time. The 
Roumi was a fool not to believe him. 

"D' you hear?" Sir Claude said, 
fiercely. 

" I hear, monsieur." 

''I know all about you. Madame 
at the auberge told me." 

"Madame at the salt mountain is 
a chamelle," Achmed answered, vi- 
ciously. " If monsieur believes such a 
? woman, a woman whom every Arab 

"That'll do. You needn't black- 
guard the woman." 
172

"If monsieur doubts my words 
will not speak at all. But I always 
tell the truth. No Arab speaks the 
truth as I do. All the rest are liars. 
I alone speak the truth. Let mon- 
sieur find out for himself. I say that 
madame walks with Benchaalal at 
night. And why not? Who would!?' 
not wish to see the moon upon the 
desert? Madame loves these things. 
Monsieur no ! Therefore monsieur 
sleeps, and madame finds some one to 
accompany her. She cannot go alone, 
and Benchaalal is not a poor Arab. 
He is an officer. So madame chooses 
Benchaalal. It is very simple." 

The last words of the Arab struck 
hard into Sir Claude's heart, as truth 
sometimes strikes like a well -aimed 
knife. 

"Therefore monsieur sleeps!" Yes, 
it was very simple. At that moment 
Sir Claude saw himself as the first 
and the last of fools. When a man 

173 





such a vision of himself, if he is 
really a man the momentary crum- 
bling of all his self-respect is suc- 
ceeded by a desire that seems made 
of granite the desire to reinstate 
himself upon his seat, his throne of 
manhood. At whatever cost he must 
do that, at whatever cost of suffering, 
of terror even, perhaps of crime. 

"Where are we?" 

Achmed stretched out his arm. 

"Monsieur sees that rock there, 
to the south, shaped like a resting 
camel?" 

"I see it." 

" From that rock monsieur can see 
the villages of El-Akbara." 

Sir Claude pulled up the mule. 

"I'll get down here." 

He swung himself to the ground 
before Achmed could speak. 

"Take the mule." 

"Monsieur is not going alone?" 

"Yes. You're to stay here and 



wait for me. Give me some of the 
food." 

"But if monsieur wishes to de- 
scend I must come with him to show 
the way." 

" I did not say I was going down. 
Give me the food." 

He slung one of the guns over his 
shoulder. 

" But I am responsible for monsieur. 
When it gets dark " 

" Achmed," Sir Claude said, abrupt- 
ly, "here's a hundred francs." 

He drew out a note and put it into 
the guide's eager hand. 

" If you attempt to follow me, you 
won't get another penny. If you 
stay here as I tell you, you'll get more. 
Do you understand ?" 

"And if if monsieur does not re-/ 7 
turn?" 

TT 4. !.:> 

Have you got a watch? 
"Yes, monsieur." 
"If by midnight I haven't com< 
175 






back, you can do what you like. You 
can come after me, or you can go to 
the camp. The food!" 

The guide handed it to him in 
silence. 
. "Au revoir!" 

"Au revoir, m'sieu! Bon voyage!" 

He stood holding the mule, and 
watched Sir Claude walk away with 
long strides towards the mountain 
that was dominated by the mighty 
rock. 

Sir Claude walked on till the rocks 
hid him from Achmed's sight. Then 
he stopped for a moment and looked 
around him. The sun was already 
declining, and upon those mountains 
which were not within the circle of 
its final glories there was settling a 
strange grayness. Their naked flanks 
and treeless summits looked worn 
and weary, like a face lined with 
the travail of life. The lonely man 

drew a long breath as he looked at 
176 



them. He was wondering, wonder- 
ing at the thought of the joy that 
had come to him from these moun- 
tain fastnesses only a few hours be- 
fore. Then he had revelled in their 
wildness, had been stirred by the 
thought of their remoteness from 
England. The blood in his veins 
had leaped in answer to the winds 
that blew over them, in answer to 
the sun that made their scattered 
crystals shine like jewels. An in- 
tense physical well-being had been 
generated within him by the African 
airs, the African desolation, by the 
freedom and the strangeness of this 
spacious, undressed country. 

Now he felt a horror and a hatred 
of all that had rejoiced him. They 
had come to him with a horror and a 
hatred of the men whose native land 
this was. 

Sir Claude that evening was like 
g^ a man who has fallen into an abyss 





from a sunlit peak. His world, the 
world he had known and believed in, 
had suddenly vanished out of his 
sight. All familiar landmarks were 
gone. And the utterly incredulous 
man was turned into a man ready to 
be credulous of any abomination. 

That the woman he had mentally 
set far above him should have done 
the unimaginable thing, should have 
allowed one of these brown men to 
he ground his teeth together and 
went on towards that rock like a 
Cresting camel. He was confused. 
[He walked in a nightmare. 

Kitty's birth, bringing -up, life, 
[tastes all seemed to give the lie to 
[the truth. Was she mad? Was she 
^immeasurably corrupt ? How had he 
tnever suspected it ? Her caprices had 
>een like the caprices of a child. 
rAnd what was she ? 

He did not formulate to himself 
^what she had possibly done. He did 



178 



fe&V 



not mentally accuse her definitely of 
what everybody would acknowledge 
to be the last infamy. He stopped 
short of that because it seemed to him 
just then that what he was sure of 
was enough. For he was sure. Even 
without Achmed's words and he be- 
lieved them, he somehow knew that 
they were true he was sure. 

That morning, when he had reach- 
ed the hotel, he had hurried up the 
stairs and gone at once to his wife's 
room. He had found it empty, and 
as he stood there staring at the bed 
he knew a horrible thing, knew that 
he had expected to find it empty, had 
known almost that it would be 
empty. 

It is very strange that sometimes, 
if we are close to a person whom we 
cannot see, and of whose presence we 
are not otherwise aware, but with 
whom we are very intimate, we feel ] 

that person is near us. Something, 
179 





we know not what, tells us so. We 
may believe that we reject the subtle 
information, but do we ever really 
reject it? 

Few people would have picked out 
Sir Claude Wyverne as a sensitive 
man. Nevertheless, in connection 
with his wife he could be very sensi- 
tive. That morning, as he sat on his 
mule face to face with the very com- 
posed African, who smiled at him half- 
sleepily, and sent pale - blue smoke 
out through his dilated nostrils, Sir 
Claude had felt suddenly as if his wife 
were near him. It was then that he 
had looked behind the Spahi, had 
made a movement as if to get off his 
mule. The Spahi had read him in 
that moment, had known that it was 
terribly critical. But he had kept 
his head. He had met Sir Claude's 
movement with absolute immobility, 
Sir Claude's strained, searching glance 
with eyes that held only a calm 



i So 





serenity. And he had stopped 
Claude from carrying out his inten- 
tion as certainly as if he had seized 
and bound him to his mule by the 
exercise of superior strength. 

The African's calm had made Sir 
Claude realize then the probable mad- 
ness of his own supposition. He had 
felt for the moment ashamed of him- 
self and had ridden away. Neverthe- 
less, directly he had gone, again had 
come to him the horrible feeling that 
Kitty had been near to him when he 
was near to Benchaalal. In vain he 
combated this feeling. It remained 
with him all the way through the 
5 gorge and until he drew up before 
the inn door. Then he went up- 
stairs and saw the empty room. And 
then it seemed to him that he knew 
knew the incredible, the impossible. 

Yet he did not go back to the 
Spahi. Kitty had thought that he 
could not be subtle; anything else, 





not subtle. Yet even she did not 
know, did not divine all that there was 
in her husband, all that he might be, 
might do under unusual circumstances. 
When he saw that empty bedroom 
a new man seemed suddenly to be 
born within Sir Claude, a man con- 
ceived in infinite travail. That new 
man was quiet, self -con trolled. He 
stood for a moment very still. Then 
he turned and went to his bedroom 
and locked himself in. The green 
persiennes that were fastened over 
the French windows which opened on 
to the veranda prevented any one 
upon the veranda from looking into 
the bedroom, but permitted any per- 
son in the bedroom to see clearly 
into the world without. The win- 
dows were shut. Sir Claude opened 

| them gently and stood still behind 
the persiennes. There he remained, 
waiting, motionless, with his hands 

Changing by his sides and his eyes, 



bloodshot with fatigue, staring at the 
white road beyond the Judas- trees. 
And at last he saw coming along the 
white road a woman with a white 
face. He saw her look up at his 
windows, a glance of dreadful, search- 
ing anxiety. It seemed to him for 
a moment that he met her eyes, that 
they stared into his, that they knew 
he was there. Then she passed out 
of his sight, creeping across the pave- 
ment of the court. And then, pres- 
ently, he heard behind him a soft 
and furtive step, like the step of a 
thief or a marauder, the creak of a 
door. She had come in, his wife. 
She was close to him. He heard her 
key turn in the lock. 

And only then was he conscious 
that drops of sweat were rolling down // ,//,, 
his face. 

He went over to the washstand . 
and bathed his face. His big hands 
were trembling. They wanted to 




i* -. 




something. He knew what they want- 
ed to do. At that moment they long- J 
ed to kill the woman they had soj 
often caressed. 

He looked down at them with a 
of dull wonder. 

The wonder had never quite left 
him since then. 

Now he walked on again slowly, 
mounting over the uneven ground 
towards the great rock from which 
he would be able to see the three 
villages of El-Akbara. 

When he reached it the sun had 
gone down, but there was still some 
red in the western sky. He sat down 
upon the rock and looked over the 
desert. He meant to descend pres- 
ently, but he must rest for a moment. 
He must think, or try to think. 

He felt horribly tired both in body 
and in mind. 

As he looked out upon the desert 

again the sense of utter loneliness, of 
184 



immense desolation came over him. 
He fingered his gun mechanically as 
he sat there. 

In the distance, among the great, 
tufted palm-trees, he saw thin trails of 
smoke rising from the African houses, 
tiny birds they were doves, but he did 
not know it circling about a brown 
minaret, that from this height looked 
black, some camels creeping along the 
road towards the south. Beside the 
camels little hooded men walked 
swiftly. 

These hooded men were of the race 
of the Spahi, of the dark-blooded 
Oriental race. 

A sort of sickness came upon Sir 
Claude. Kitty was bone of his bone, 
! flesh of his flesh, yet now there was a 
gulf between them. He was on this, 
the hither side of it. She was upon 
the farther side, the side where the 
dark races swarmed beneath the tor- 
jid African sun. Secretly, in the night, 




-v; 



while he slept the sleep of the fool, 
she had crossed the gulf. 

He believed he hated her. And 
he kept on fingering his gun. 

Yes, he hated her, and he had a 
right to hate her. He said that to 
himself dully. 

There was not a living Englishman 
who would not condemn her. She 
had put herself out of court. 

Even now he did not say to him- 
self that she had committed the worst 
\ offence. It was not necessary to say 
'that. He knew enough without that, 
i For now he was sure that when he had 
k spoken to Benchaalal by the river she 
[had been there. She had been with 
i the Arab, and when he, her husband, 
I had come she had hidden from him. 

That was enough. He wished he 
>had killed her in her hiding-place. 

The desert was growing darker. 
I He got up from the rock and turned 
to go down to the gorge.

BENCHAALAL sat cross-legged in 
a corner of the principal cafe 
maure of the brown village of El- 
Akbara. This cafe was situated on 
the high-road that led to the desert, 
and was opposite to the Arab ceme- 
tery a quantity of upright stones 
fixed in the hard, sun-dried earth, 
without w r all or fence to guard the 
homes of the dead from intruders. 
Outside the caf6 was a sort of arbor 
made of reeds. In this squatted four 
or five Arabs playing dominoes. But 
within the cafe there was no one but 
the Spahi and the bare -legged at- 
tendant who served the coffee, which 
he took from a niche of earth in which 
187 





glowed a fire of brushwood. Now 
and then an Arab passed across the 
space of the doorway. One or two 
even looked in and solemnly spoke 
a greeting to the Spahi. But he 
seemed to hear nothing, to see no one. 
With his eyes fixed upon the ground 
he sipped his coffee and smoked 
cigarette after cigarette, taking the 
tobacco from a long silver box which 
lay beside him, and rolling it swiftly 
and deftly in the thin slips of paper 
of which he always carried a large 
supply. 

He was absorbed. His mind lay 
deep down in reverie. All trace of 
the fury which had convulsed him 
when he was with Achmed had died 
out of his face. He looked quite calm, 
almost sleepy. But his mind was 
fiercely alive. His passions were 
"ablaze. And all the time that he 
motionless he was meditating 
activity. 



1 88 





Benchaalal was swiftly intellig- 
without being what English people 
sometimes call "deep." Where his 
own dear interests were involved he 
was acute and quite without scruple. 
And though, perhaps, he could not 
have been subtle for a long time, could 
not have been very patient in any 
cleverness, he knew how to be both 
ingenious and secretive at a moment, 
as he had proved many times in his 
life. But he had the fault which 
spoils so much Arab diplomacy. 
When his passions were strong he was 
often carried away by them. His 
temper often pulled down the edi- 
fice built up by his craft. And when 
calm returned to him he looked upon 
the ruins. 

Already he had realized the mis- 
take he had made with Achmed. 

The guide would surely go and be- 
tray him to the Roumi, to the big, 

blond hunter of Barbary sheep, who 
189 










|went to bed ere the moon was up, and 
who left his pretty creature, his little 
squirrel of the woods, his rose of the 
garden, his Fatima with the eyes like 
turquoises, and the tiny hands like 
silver, to hear the Spahi's serenade, 
and to sit beside the Spahi by the 
river. Benchaalal had a great con- 
tempt for the Roumi the contempt 
of the cultured Mussulman for the un- 
cultured Christian, than which there 
are few feelings more unmeasured, 
f|few feelings more profound. But he 

I must take the Roumi into account, 
must reckon with him now that the 
great mistake was made and that the 
outburst of fury which had caused it> 
was subsiding. 

What would the Roumi do? 
Benchaalal had his own ideas about 

Sj t ' 

^foreigners, gathered chiefly from his 
intercourse with the French in Al- 
giers and during two visits which he 

had made to Paris. Of the English 
190 



he knew but little. He knew them 
to be a great nation. He conceived 
of them as all very rich. He imag- 
ined them all dwelling in a northern 
land which was perpetually shroud- 
ed in heavy yellow clouds of great 
density called by them "Le fogge." 
The blood in such lands ran cold, he 
supposed. Without the sun, how 
could there be fire in men ? 

He knew very well what an Arab 
would do, or try to do, if he were told 
a story such as Achmed would surely 
tell the Roumi, had, perhaps, al- 
ready told him. He would kill, or 
try to kill, the woman who had 
wronged his pride of possession and 
the man who had persuaded her. 
But the English were not like the 
Arabs. They let their women run.// , 

// /! 

loose. They let them talk and laugh^ Jy; 
with any man who came near. TOM 
an Arab the freedom of Western Ml 
women is a perpetual source of amaze- m 








>l ment, and the situation of the West- 
ern man in regard to his women 
!?' makes him an object of secret con- 
r'jf tempt among Orientals. This con- 
tempt, felt strongly by Benchaalal, 
caused him to ponder now. Although 
he knew what he would do were he 
Sir Claude, he could not tell what 
Sir Claude would do. 

He had looked into the Roumi's 
face on the river-bank. It had been 
stern, hard. The eyes were search- 
ing. It was a man's face. That 
was certain. Yet this man had slept 
each night, leaving his woman to do 
what she would. And he had de- 
serted her each day. Perhaps he 
did not care what happened. 

Nothing had happened yet. 

His mind left Sir Claude and went 
to Lady Wyverne. And here the 
Spahi was on surer ground. He had 
an instinct with women. Western 

men he did not understand thorough- 
193 




ly, despite his intercourse with the 
French. But he would have laughed 
to hear any one tell him that he could 
be long tricked or puzzled by a wom- 
an, that a woman could play with 
him, or read him while keeping the 
pages of her book closed from his 
eyes. For a moment he put aside 
Sir Claude and his possible actions, 
and concentrated himself upon the 
little squirrel of the woods, the rose 
of the garden. 

Granted that Sir Claude did not 

interfere at once, granted that Lady 

Wyverne was not carried off to Beni- 

K Mora, what would she do? What 

\ would she do now if left to herself ? 

fe[ Very deep grew Benchaalal's rev- 

\erie. For a while he even forgot to 

s^ sip his coffee and roll a new cigarette. 

^-_ His eyes were fixed on the floor. 

His hands dropped down to his feet 

and held them loosely. 

Presently across the sunlit space 





of the doorway passed a strange figure 
clad in bright green, with a green-and- 
red turban. It was the mad Mara- 
bout wandering to and fro, absorbed, 
led, perhaps, by some hallucination. 
Two, three times he passed and re- 
passed before the door of the cafe" 
unobserved by Benchaalal. Then he 
came in under the arbor of reeds and 
stood still, peering into the shadowy 
room with his large, blue eyes, which 
were like the eyes of a distracted 
Christ. Benchaalal did not look up. 
The Marabout stared at him, hesitated, 
moved a little away, then seemed to 
^ftake courage, stepped furtively into 
the cafe", came towards Benchaalal, 
and finally squatted down near him 
on the floor. 

The attendant stared in grave sur- 
prise, for the madman never went 
beneath a roof, but seemed to have 
| a passion for the sky and the air, and 
!p for years had always slept under the 




stars. After regarding the Marabout 
for a moment, he made a guttural 
sound in his throat and pointed tow- 
ards the brass coffee-pot. The Mar- 
about paid no attention. He was 
looking alternately at Benchaalal and 
at the floor, with a flickering curios- 
ity and uneasiness that were almost 
wholly animal. At length the Spahi 
glanced up and noticed his companion. 

" Bring me another coffee, Ah- 
meda," he said to the attendant. 

When it was brought he held it out 
to the Marabout, who accepted it 
furtively and began to sip, looking 
away with his head held on one side, 
like one performing an unusual ac- 
tion that he fears may be condemned 
if seen. 

The Spahi began to roll a cigarette. 
When it was finished he put it into 
the Marabout's hand. Then he rolled 
one for himself and again seemed to 
sink into a reverie. 

195 




The Marabout smoked slowly and 
carefully, gazing at the smoke, as it 
curled away from his lips and evap- 
orated, with an air of childish won- 
der. And presently Benchaalal be- 
gan to watch him. He remembered 
when this man had been sane, when 
he had been respected for his wealth. 
A visit to Beni-Mora had been his 
ruin. In the dusty, dancing street, 
with its wailing music, its gleaming 
lights, its small, white houses, he had 
met his fate in the girl from the south, 
Ayesha. 

What a strange thing to go mad 
for a woman, to come to this! To 
sit with the Marabout was almost 
like sitting with an animal. Ben- 
chaalal's mind ran on women and 
the havoc they cause, and he won- 
^dered whether he would ever be re- 
'warded for the love of them as this 
I man had been. For a moment the 

.companionship of this poor creature 
196 





almost moved him to a strange de- 
cision. What if he were to mount a 
horse, set his spurs to its flanks, and 
go out into the desert, go on and on 
with never a look behind, never a 
thought flung back to the Roumi- 
woman in the gorge. Like to like!* 
He belonged to the desert and the 
desert to him. It was as the old 
woman of the auberge had said. The 
Arab changes not. Bring him back 
to the sand and the veneer of West- 
ern civilization drops from him. He 
casts it away. He forgets it. He 
drinks the fierce red soup. He puts 
his dark fingers to the cous-cous. He 
smokes the keef . And it is gone, the 
pretence and the dream of other lands. 
It is shrivelled by the sun, his sun, 
the sun that shines upon the great, 
bare world of Allah and his Prophet. 
The Marabout stirred, whimpered. 
His cigarette was smoked out. He 

got up, balanced himself first on one 
197 





bare foot, then on the other, cast a 
shifty, sidelong glance at Benchaalal, 
and crept out of the cafe. The Spahi 
saw him walk straightforward in the 
sun until he reached the cemetery 
beyond the high-road. There he 
began to wander round and round 
among the stones that marked the 
graves, circling almost as a hungry 
pariah dog sometimes does when it 
seeks by night for carrion. 

Benchaalal wondered why he had 
come into the cafe". What had drawn 
him? He had surely shown a sort 
of sympathy, a sort of desire for 
companionship. Had his possessing 
thought of a woman gone out to 
Benchaalal's thought of a woman? 
When he met Lady Wyverne in the 
gorge that night he had come up to 
her, he had stopped beside her, he 
had gazed upon her, almost as if he 
fancied she was his Ayesha. 

Pif! The poor wretch was mad! 
198 



Useless to think about him ! Neverthe- 
less, the Spahi's eyes followed his green 
robe as he circled circled among the 
tombs in the glaring afternoon sun. 

It was nearly sunset when Ben- 
chaalal rose up, paid for his coffee, 
and went out onto the white road. 

He did not know yet that the 
Roumi had gone hunting again in the 
mountains. Achmed had not told 
him. But now, on the road, he met 
the sleepy boy from the inn and he 
learned the news. 

"They will be out all night, Ben- 
chaalal Hamdan ben Mohammed," 
said the boy. " The Roumi has taken 
a tent to sleep in. They have gone 
towards the Tell, to the mountain of 
the dwellers in the rocks." 

Benchaalal listened in silence, look- // 
ing very grave. This news surprised/'^, 
him, but he did not show any surprise. // l!i 

"Is Achmed with the stranger, the I 
Englishman?" he said, at length, til 





"Achmed is with him." 

Benchaalal said nothing more, but. 
walked down the road slowly towards 
>j the gate of the Sahara. 

So the Englishman had gone away 
.again and had left his woman to do 
as she willed! Benchaalal's aston- 
ishment deepened as he realized it. 
He thought about it carefully as he 
walked, and turned it over many 
times in his mind. Crafty as he was, 
he dismissed the idea that this de- 
parture was a trap. He could not 
help having an Arab's point of view, 
and it would have been absolutely 
impossible for an Arab who knew the 
truth to ride off into the mountains 
leaving his woman alone, even if he 
meant to come back and surprise her. 
He must have stayed. He must have 
acted quickly. His jealousy must 
have fulfilled its lust promptly, deci- 
sively, furiously. 

Benchaalal decided in his mind that 





the Roumi did not know anything 
yet. Despite his return in the night 
he did not know. But surely Achmed 
would tell him! 

The Spahi was now entering the 
gorge, and was close to the rock 
where Sir Claude had seen him when 
they spoke together. Near it, with 
his flute to his lips, sat the perpetual 
piper playing the perpetual tune. 
Benchaalal glanced at him, then back- 
ward towards the desert. Not far 
off he saw the Marabout coming fur- 
tively along the road, following him. 
He stopped. The Marabout stopped, 
too, and looked uneasy, but did not 
retreat. Benchaalal began really to 
wonder why the poor creature was 
intent upon him. Some strange idea 
must have dawned in his mind. Usu- 

L -- ally he loved solitude. He attached 
himself to no one. Many had striven 
to persuade him to enter their houses, 

b- had endeavored to win some rec- 




ognition, some affection from him, 
but always in vain. He accepted the 
food they put into his hand, but that 
was all. Directly he had it he fled, 
to eat it alone in some hidden corner 
of the rocks or some recess of the 
palm gardens. Had he conceived a 
crazy liking for the Spahi? 

Benchaalal waved his hand, called 
out to him. But the Marabout only 
tore at his fair beard, held his head 
on one side, and looked away. At 
last Benchaalal desisted and walked 
on once more. The Marabout follow- 
ed him to the entrance of the gorge, 
there again stood still staring af- 
ter him. When the Spahi disappeared 
he whimpered like an animal. Some- 
thing seemed to be disturbing, even 
distressing him. He hesitated for 
some minutes, shifting from one naked 
foot to the other. Then at last, very 
furtively, like a creature seeking its 
lair, he left the road and vanished 



iSand 



3* 



among the rocks beneath the moun- 
tain from which, just then, Sir Claude 
was looking down upon the desert and 
the villages among the palms. 




XIII 



BENCHAALAL had already for- 
gotten him. 

As the Spahi approached the inn 
his mind had gone to the woman 
within it, and the fires smouldering 
within him began to blaze up once 
more. 

Lady Wyverne and he had parted 
strangely by the river. He had been 
almost brutally imperious to her, rec- 
ognizing the necessity of recalling her 
to herself after the hysterical terror 
which had taken possession of her. 
And she had not resented his tone 
Bl'of authority at the time, but had 
lobeyed him with a sort of quick 
meekness. She had washed her face 





in the river, had controlled her 
and left him quietly, despite her 
dread of what might have happened 
in the inn. 

But all that was many hours ago. 
Benchaalal knew well that her mood 
was probably changed. The terror 
that had assailed her would have van- 
ished with the departure of her hus- 
band on this fresh sporting expedition. 
And with the departure of terror there 
would be room in her mind and heart 
for other emotions. 

These emotions might well be inim- 
ical to him. 

At that thought a fierceness leaped 
up in the Spahi's heart, a fighting 
energy that was reckless. He for- 
got Sir Claude finally, dismissed him 
to the mountains and the Barbary 
sheep, to the hunting that was surely 
the only thing he cared for. 

Another hunting engrossed the 
Spahi, the sport that was the passion 




205 




his life, the consuming passion, as 
it is of the lives of so many Arabs, 
taking precedence of all things, even 
of the pursuit of money. There was 
a woman to be conquered. She had 
nearly been conquered. So he told 
himself. Was she to escape now 
because of one contretemps brought 
about by the lack of ingenuity of the 
fool Achmed ? His hot blood boiled 
at the thought. 

As he came to the Judas-trees he 
did not see Lady Wyverne upon the 
veranda. The persiennes and the 
window of her room were open. He 
fancied he discerned a shadowy fig- 
ure beyond them, and believed her to 
be there, perhaps watching for his 
return. He wondered whether she 
wished to meet or to avoid him. With 
difficulty he summoned patience to 
him. He knew it was quite useless 
to try to speak with her for some 
hours, and he went to his room and 



206 



shut himself in till the bell rang for 
dinner. Then he came down majes- 
tically, in his wide linen trousers, his 
red jacket, his red gaiters, newly per- 
fumed, his long eyes shining beneath 
his turban. 

When he entered the dining-room 
it was occupied only by a young 
French couple, a painter and his wife, 
who had arrived that afternoon, and 
who stared at him with an interest 
which he did not return ; although he 
bowed to them in the French manner 
as he came in, and sat down at his 
little table, placing himself so that he 
would be sitting sideways to Lady 
Wyverne if she came. 

But perhaps she would not come. 

He had hardly formed the words/ 
with his mind before he heard a gentle y //& 
rustling upon the staircase, and she/j|; 
entered, carrying a book in her hand. 
Each evening hitherto she had worn f 
a high white dress and a little black ilMMA 





hat at dinner. To-night she wore the r 
same hat with a black dress, that was J s 
evidently a day dress. As the Spahi j 
very slightly bowed to her, as to a ' 
stranger, he wondered whether this 
change was caused by any motive, or 
emotion, discoverable by him. Now 
and then he glanced at her while she 
ate, trying to read her face. He 
thought it looked colder, harder than 
usual, even a little older. But that 
might be a fancy caused by his knowl- 
edge of what had happened to her 
that day. She did not stay till the 
end of dinner. After the first course 
of meat she got up quietly and went 
out. He heard her dress rustling as 
she ascended the stairs. 

He lingered a long while at his 
table, taking his coffee there instead 
of outside under the veranda. The 
French painter and his wife disap- 
peared, and he was left alone. He 

wondered what Lady Wyverne was 
208 



doing, whether she had shut herself 
up in her room, had gone to bed, 
whether she would be out on the 
veranda. Surely she would give him 
a chance of speaking with her. If 
not, he meant to make one for him- 
self. He waited till the household 
and the servants were safely at sup- 
per. Then he strolled out to the 
little court, and went to the place 
where he had stood on the evening of 
the Wyvernes' arrival, by the fence 
under the Judas -trees. He did not 
look up immediately, but took out 
the silver box and carefully rolled a 
cigarette. When he had put it be- 
tween his lips and lit it, he glanced at 
the veranda. 

_ She was not there, but he saw the 
:SiL gleam of light in her room, the win- 
dow of which was open. And pres- 
ently he saw her figure, like a black 
-"^=. shadow, passing to and fro in the lit 
: " 3 space. What was she doing ? Pack- 




ing, perhaps, or getting ready to come 
out. He waited quietly. Presently 
he saw her figure no more. But the 
light still burned. He had finished 
his cigarette. He threw the end of it 
away. Then he opened his mouth 
and began to sing, or whine, the 
curious Eastern song with which he 
had serenaded Lady Wyverne before 
he had ever spoken to her. It was a 
song about a Caid who loved a dan- 
cer, and who gave her many presents, 
>gold and silver bracelets, amulets and 
I veils, a hedgehog's foot and a powder 
(of haschish. Whenever she danced he 
as there to watch her, and at last 
[he played upon the derbouka before 
(all the city, and she danced to his tune. 
|And when he had finished he gave 
(her the derbouka to hang upon the 
> wall of her little room as a token of her 
[power. 

It was a song of many verses, but 
I at last it was ended. 






The Spahi looked at the light, 
smoked another cigarette. Still she 
did not come. 

Then he sang the chanson des 
vacances of the children of the Zibans ; 
and then he sang the song of the 
Great Mozabite whose love demanded 
as a marriage-gift the head of All, 
the son-in-law of the Prophet. The 
Mozabite murdered Ali in the mosque 
with a sabre, and since that time the 
Mozabites are hated by all the other 
Arabs. When he got to the last verse, 
the hatred verse, Benchaalal raised 
his voice, lifting his head up. 

In the silence that followed he 
heard the noise of the river rushing 
through the gorge. His blood was 
on fire, and there was a noise in his 
brain or so he fancied that seemed 
to be caused by the surging of this 
blood on fire through his veins and 
arteries. The motionless trees an- 
gered him. The white road, still 




and empty, angered him. The black 
rocks that frowned above the inn 
infuriated him as he stared up at 
them. Everything seemed still to 
watch his impotence, to observe the 
failure of his desires. 

But as yet he could do nothing. 
He must wait until the landlord and 
his wife had gone to bed. Another 
hour and, if she had not come to him, 
he would go to her. He moved away 
from the fence and went out onto 
the white road. There he strolled 
softly up .and down, up and down. 
Above him the deep-purple sky be- 
gan to grow bright with silver. 

Surely she would come with the 
moon! 

In her bedroom Lady Wyverne was 
sitting in a hard arm-chair which she 
pulled away from the window, 
had been putting some things into 

trunk. She was devoured by a 
nervous restlessness which made it 






almost impossible for her to 
still, and the act of packing seemed 
to back up a resolution which she 
thought she had come to, the resolu- 
tion to see Benchaalal no more. She 
said to herself that her husband 
might leave her alone, or stay with 
her, might sleep or wake, be careless 
or watchful. It did not concern her 
any longer. She had done with her 
whim. For she had told herself it 
was a whim. The terror she had felt 
when she crouched down, hiding in 
the Spahi's cloak, had struck from 
her mind the caprice which had al- 
ways dominated her. For she had 
only had a caprice for Benchaalal. 
That she said to herself again and 
again. She would never risk her 
dignity more. It was over, this "bit 
of fun" in the desert, and thank God 
it had led to no evil consequences. 
For Crumpet could not know any- 
thing. His unexpected return must 
213 






have been really due to the discom- 
fort of the inn at the salt mountain. 
It must have been her own feeling 
of guilt which had made her imagine 
a strangeness in his manner, a certain 
coldness and reserve unusual in him. 
At the worst his suspicions must have 
been quite vague. It occurred to her 
that Achmed might have spoken, or, 
if he had not, might yet speak, tell 
what he knew. But why should he ? 
She divined that he was in Bencha- 
alal's pay, though the Spahi had not 
told her so. She knew Achmed had 
been to the villages that day. No 
doubt he had seen Benchaalal. No 
doubt Benchaalal had made things 
" all right." She put away her fears, 
told herself that she had had a lucky 
escape, and resolved henceforward to 
have nothing to do with any strange- 
ness that caught at her curiosity in 
Africa. 

She sat down in the hard arm-chair 



314 



and took up a book. It was a French 
novel. As she looked at its first 
pages she seemed to hear the tap of 
high-heeled boots upon the trottoirs 
of Paris. Well, she adored Paris! 
It would be delicious to see it again, 
delicious to go to the shops, and 

Benchaalal began to sing the whin- 
ing song of the Caid who loved the 
dancer and who played for her upon 
the derbouka. 

Lady Wyverne's novel dropped 
down into her lap. She sat quite 
still, listening. 

It was ugly ; yes, it was quite ugly. 
That whining voice would have no 
success if it sang in her world. That 
tune would be considered "too shock- 
ingly hideous. ' ' And yet it won upon 
her, it fascinated her, it made her 
regret that she was not free, free as a , 
man is to follow his caprice, to in-, 
vestigate any mystery that appeals j 
to him, to set his feet in any path . 






that seems 

promise. \~ 

It must be glorious to be perfect- j 
r* ly free ! Africa and its people had ' 
roused in Lady Wyverne a spirit of 
^adventure which often lies dormant 
in those who are highly capricious, 
and this spirit of adventure extended 
its arms to the Spahi, as to a magician 
who could give it what it longed for. 

Benchaalal's voice died away, end- 
ing in the air, like a thing thrown up 
towards the stars. 

Lady Wyverne took up her book 
again. But all the fascination of 
Paris had evaporated from its pages, 
which now seemed arid and hard as 
the pavements which echoed with 
high heels. She thought of naked 
brown feet treading softly in African 
slippers. 

Again Benchaalal sang. 

She knew quite well why he was 

singing. It was his summons to her 
216 



to come out to him. And she was 
not going to obey. She was soon 
going to shut the persiennes, undress, 
put out the light, get into bed. She 
looked at the bed. It was intended to 
be slept in. And she would not sleep. 
How utterly impossible it would be to 
sleep ! 

The chanson des vacances did not 
sound very gay to her ears. She 
did not know what it meant, but 
fancied it a song of the sadness of the 
desert. As she listened to it she 
thought of the morrow. Certainly 
they would go away on the morrow. 
Once more she would be isolated with 
Crumpet. Her intercourse with the 
Spahi had opened her eyes thorough- 
ly to the nullity of Crumpet except 

|_ when he was angry. She felt certain 

" that if he were really roused to anger, 

her husband could be impressive, even 

_ terrible. But otherwise ! There 
= was something tragic in possessing a 





husband who could only be interest- 
ing when he was furious. 

Benchaalal was always interesting, 
and she had never seen him furious. 
Now he sang the song of the Moza- 
bite who murdered the Prophet's son- 
in-law in the mosque. The hatred 
verse sounded quite loudly in her 
ears. Then there was silence. She 
listened. She expected another song. 
But the silence prolonged itself, and 
presently she felt sure that the Spahi 
had understood that his summons was 
in vain. 

Had he gone away ? 

She longed to know, but she did 
not move from her chair, and pres- 
ently she took up her novel again. 
But the restlessness in her increased 
and she found it almost impossible 
to remain still. Reading about Paris 
had made her mind go back to the 
day when she had visited the as- 
trologer with her husband. She re- 



called his written words. He had 
foreseen that her husband would be 
in danger of losing her for so she 
interpreted the " grande perte." He 
would be in danger of losing her, but 
had he ever really possessed her? 
Had any one? And she, could she 
ever give herself utterly, with com- 
plete abnegation, to any one? She 
did not know. But she knew that 
the Spahi had had more empire over 
her than any other man had ever/ 
gained. She thought of this empire 
as at an end deliberately. He had 
begun to dominate her. But for this !; 
fright, which had awakened her 
sharply to a sense of the true value of jj 
events, he might have increased his 
dominion. Something of the spirit of * 
the slave had certainly entered into 
her while with this man, who per- 
haps had wives who were little more 
than slaves. It was odd that as she 
now sat thinking of this subjection of 





her will and spirit to his she did not 
feel angry or even greatly humbled. 
Rather she was conscious of missing 
a pleasure which she desired to enjoy 
once more. 

She sighed and again looked at the 
high bed. It was certainly impossi- 
ble that she could sleep. She won- 
dered where her husband was ; prob- 
ably stretched on a camp-bed under 
the shadow of his tent, snoring. 
Mountains surrounded him, she sup- 
posed. And at dawn he would be out 
with his gun. 

And if Achmed had told him! 

But Achmed 's lips were closed by 
the Spahi's money. She felt sure of 
that. She knew that she ought also 
to feel indignant about it. Perhaps, 
in another land, she would have 
:felt indignant. But such enterprises 
rseemed not unnatural, certainly, not 
leven very culpable, here. 

By the river, as she crouched be- 





Tt 

*M 



neath Benchaalal's cloak, she had 
humiliated. But this sensation of 
shame had mysteriously left her with 
the terror that had been its companion. 

And yet she certainly did not love 
this man. She did not love him, yet 
she felt a strong inclination to follow 
him and to obey him. It was as if 
he held in his hand a thin cord to 
which she was attached, and when- 
ever he pulled, however gently, at 
this cord she felt that she must move 
in the direction he desired. 

Even now he was pulling at the 
cord, somewhere outside in the night. 
She was conscious of the subtle tug- 
tug. 

If only he were not there, and she 
could go out upon the veranda and 
see the night and breathe the air from 
the desert! She felt imprisoned in 
this little room. It seemed to her 
that the atmosphere within it was 
suffocating. 





She had packed her things in readi- 
ness for the morrow's departure, and 
was wearing a travelling dress, as the 
Spahi had noticed. It was insuffer- 
ably tight and thick, and now, un- 
able to be still, she got up, went to 
her trunk, and took out a dress of a 
thinner material and dark red in 
color. She had not worn it in El- 
Akbara. Quickly she exchanged the 
travelling dress for it. Then she 
looked in the glass. She was sur- 
prised by the excited expression on 
her face. Her shining eyes were 
full of anticipation. This red gown 
looked unfinished without any jewels. 
She had a small jewel-case in her 
dressing-bag. She opened it, took 
out a long diamond chain, and hung 
lit round her neck. 

She had heard that the Arabs de- 
light in jewels and in all sparkling 
things, that their women are covered 
^ with gold coins and precious amulets. 

*i \ 



A great wish came to her that the 
Spahi might see her once, for a mo- 
ment, in this red gown and with 
these diamonds. It was the desire 
of a coquette. After to-morrow they 
would probably never meet again. 
No doubt he would quickly forget all 
about her. She felt as if she would 
like to leave a last impression that 
would efface his remembrance of her, 
sobbing, tear-stained, and obedient. 

She sighed, standing still and hold- 
ing the diamond chain lightly with 
her two hands. 

Then she did what she had resolved 
not to do. She stepped out onto the 
veranda. 

It was already late; or so the 
Frenchman who kept the inn thought. 
He and his wife and the servants had / 
gone to bed. Deep silence reigned , 
over this cloistered world on the edge|/ 
of the world of freedom, silence 
broken only by the voice of the river. 








And that voice, enclosed in this ex- 
quisite casket of silence, seemed in-{ 
fluenced by it, seemed to be refined, j 

y ^ 

-j^ softened to a tenderness that was 1 
pathetic, that was almost yearning. 
The moon was coming up, thrusting 
its golden rim above the ebony sil- 
houette of a great rock. 

Lady Wyverne watched it almost 
breathlessly, as it rose with a mys- 
terious steadiness, till its full circle 
was released from the fierce and 
dramatic shadow and was at liberty 
in the serene and starry sky. 

That prisoner at least was free. 

She looked across the court at the 
dark trees and at the road beyond. 
No one was upon it. She looked 
away to the dim shapes of the moun- 
tains. Her husband was somewhere 
among them. With the coming of 
the deep night a slight uneasiness 
that had been lurking in the under 
part of her mind had disappeared. 



224 



Sir Claude was certainly away ir- 
revocably. 

And Benchaalal? 

A shadowy figure stole down the 
road, going towards the desert. It 
passed before she had had time to look 
at it closely, and disappeared into 
the moonlight. That it was an Arab 
she had seen. But that was all. 
The figure had seemed to be running. 
It fled as quickly, as silently as a 
shadow over a white sheet. 

Lady Wyverne was startled and 
held her breath for a moment. She 

\even turned half round to the lighted 
room behind her, moved by a sudden 
feeling that there was danger in this 
solitude, that she had better go in 
from the veranda, close the persi- 
^S|. ennes, and forget the strange magic 
'without. But as she turned she 
again heard the Spahi singing, only 
v-^^ just heard him. The voice was al- 
a murmur, and she could not tell 





where it came from. But she knew 
that he was waiting, that he had seen 
her, that he was calling her. 

Once again, as so many times in her 
life, the hands, the light but wilfully 
obstinate hands of caprice took hold 
of her. And she was so afraid of re- 
sisting them knowing that to-night 
there was alive within her a some- 
thing that was cautious, that was 
even afraid that she yielded abrupt- 
ly to their guidance. Without paus- 
ing to catch up a cloak, she went 
softly out of her room, down the 
dark staircase, and out into the court- 
yard. 




XIV 



BENCHAALAL, who was be- 
neath the veranda, smiled when 
he saw Lady Wyverne come into the 
court and look swiftly round her. 
For a moment he did not move, but 
watched the little, slight figure in its 
red dress, the sparkle of the thin 
chain of diamonds in the moonlight. 
How dainty and elfin she looked, how 
different from the terrified woman by 
the river! She crossed the court, 
going towards the Judas -trees. He 
came out and joined her. 

When she saw him she said, in a 
low voice: 

"Did you see that man go past?" 

"Madame?" 




"Just now, a man running! He 
went that way." 

She pointed towards the mouth of 
the gorge. 

"I saw no one, madame. But I 
was not thinking of men on the road. 
Was it an Arab?" 

"Yes." 

"Let us follow him." 

"No. I have come down to say 
good-bye. We go to-morrow. I 
have been very silly here and I am 
very glad to go." 

She stood looking at him. Again 
her hands had gone up to the chain 
of diamonds and held it lightly. 

Benchaalal loved jewels, and all 
things that glittered and shone. His 
Oriental imagination was stirred by 
them. They roused his senses, too, 

perfume did, and music and bright 
^colors. Their fierceness called to 
[the fierceness in him. It was not 
^very wise of Lady Wyverne to have 



228 






put them on that night. She saw 
eyes go to them and stay with them 
for an instant, then look at her with 
a glance that was bright like steel. 

" Let us walk through the gorge for 
the last time," he said. 

She shook her head. 

"After this morning no! I had 
a fright, a lesson!" 

She spoke in her most airy, most 
petulantly childish way, trying to 
abolish from his mind the memory of 
her hysterical collapse. 

"A lesson from your husband?" 

"Well yes." 

"And he is giving you another 
lesson to-night, madame. Will you 
never learn the meaning of Barbary 
sheep?" 

As he finished he glanced nervously 
at the hotel, as if he suspected that 
they were being watched, overheard. 
In reply to his glance she said: 

" Well, just beyond the trees, then !" 





B\x\_ 

He held open the gate for her. They 
passed out and went a few steps down 
the road. 

"You don't understand English- 
men," she said. 

"Mon Dieu! How can I?" He 
shrugged his shoulders and lifted his 
slim hands. "We get our blood 
warmed each day by the sun, ma- 
dame, we Arabs. How can we un- 
derstand?" 

His eyes were again on her jewels. 
They spoke to him in the moonbeams. 
Each diamond, when it glittered, had 
a voice. 

"You think?" 

She hesitated. She knew what he 
was thinking, that her husband cared 
nothing for her, that his soul was 
wrapped up in the love of sport. It 
seemed as if it were so. But she 
knew that it was not. She knew, and 
yet so subtle was this man's influ- 
S-J ence upon her that now he sent to 



230 



her his doubt if it were doubt and 
not pretence of doubt. 

He moved on a few steps very 
quietly, and she went with him as if 
unconsciously. 

"Madame, I think that what wom- 
an chooses not to see she does not 
see, that what woman chooses not to 
realize she does not realize. Am I 
wrong? I am only an Arab. I can- 
not know. I can only hazard. I can 
only guess." 

Humility from a man with eyes 
like his, eyes sparkling with intel- 
ligence, keen and searching, almost 
cunning, came absurdly. 

"Only an Arab!" exclaimed Lady 
Wyverne. 

She could not think of these dark 
men as her husband did. To her 
they seemed subtle as women, 
bued with a strange femininity de- 
spite their ruthlessness, their fierce- 
ness. 





' You doubtless you think we are 
barbarians?" 

She looked up at him. At thatj 
^moment she knew that it was the! 
" barbarian in him which attracted 
. her, or at least the barbarous strain 
in him which was combined with 
something else. 

"You are afraid of us, perhaps?" 
he added. "You think we are ca- 
pable of everything?" He used the 
French expression, capable de tout. 
"Is it not so?" 

"I I think you might be." 

They were still walking onward 
towards the gate of the desert. The 
voice of the river was in their ears, 
the silver of the moonbeams was 
about them. Benchaalal's eyes went 
continually to the flashing fires of 
the diamonds that hung down to his 
companion's waist. 

"And is it not better so? What 
is a man if he is not capable of all 



when he feels all, when he desires all ? 
Would you have his manners tame, 
his words slow, his face calm, when 
his heart is on fire, when his nature is 
calling, when his blood is crying out, 
crying out like the river there as it 
rushes towards the desert ? It wants 
its freedom, and the man wants his; 
wants the liberty to be as he really is, 
to act no more, but to hate and to 
love as his blood tells him. The 
Englishman! He does not want all 
this. What does he want ? Barbary 
sheep, mon Dieu! Barbary sheep!" 
He laughed low, as if to himself. 
"Well, then, in the name of Allah 
and of his Prophet, let the English- 
man have his Barbary sheep, but let 
the Arab have" he stopped, then 
he added, slowly "his desire, the 
desire of his life." 

Lady Wyverne felt as if his words 
were gusts of heat from a furnace 
'coming to her fiercely. She knew 




mm: 



& I 



that she did not really care for the 
Spahi, yet whenever she was with him 
he forced her, as it were, into his 
atmosphere. Some men have this 
power. They spread a magic carpet. 
They carry you away, out of your 
window, over the tree-tops, over the 
seas, far off to the strange lands, 
where the voices are strange and the 
flowers strange, and you lose your 
identity and become as the strange 
people are. 

Again Lady Wyverne smelt the 
j perfume that emanated from his gar- 
;ments. She stopped. 

"Where are we going?" she said. 
"I told you I would not walk with 
iyou to-night." 

" Madame, it is the last time. To- 
morrow you go, and I I go on my 
three days' journey into the desert. 
You will never come there. You will 
take the train to-morrow. You will 
go back to England. It is good-bye. ' ' 



;. 



"Yes, it is good-bye." 

Again she felt tempted. A longing 
to taste, just to taste, the mysterious 
African life assailed her, and her own 
existence presented itself to her as 
ineffably commonplace, insufferably 
empty. It was safe; yes, protected, 
but it was frightfully tame. Again 
she was the child tempted by the 
Celestial's pigtail. 

"I know; but" 

"You must at least say good-bye 
to the desert, madame." 

" But what do you mean ? We 
are not going to England to-morrow. 
We are going on to Beni-Mora to- 
morrow." 

Benchaalal said nothing. He look- 
ed at her in silence, but in his eyes 
there seemed to be a sort of ironical 
pity and surprise. 

"Why why do you look at me 
like that?" she said. 

"But madame does not know?" 




235 




"Know what?" 

"That monsieur turns his back on 
the desert?" 

"I know nothing. I don't under- 
stand." 

"Then I had better be silent. 
Madame will know to-morrow." 

"Tell me now. Tell me at once." 

"To-day did you not notice any- 
thing strange in monsieur's manner 
to-day?" said Benchaalal, drawing a 
bow at a venture, very craftily. 

"Yes, I what did it mean?" 

"That monsieur is tired of Africa, 
that to-morrow he turns his back to 
the desert. In Beni-Mora there are 
no Barbary sheep. Therefore, mon- 
sieur will not go to Beni-Mora." 

"How do you know this?" 

" But all at the hotel knows it, the 
patron, the Arabs, every one. Per- 
jhaps not madame! The wise man 
facts quickly, without speech, when 

he acts against his wife's desire. 
236 





!l 



Madame will know. To-morrow 
will know, when she steps into the 
train that goes to Tunis!" 

"Then then I shall never see the 
real desert." 

A bitter sense of disappointment, 
almost of outrage, swept over Lady 
Wyverne. All the wilfulness, which 
had ruled so long, seemed to start up, 
like a wild creature at the touch of 
a whip. She believed what Ben- 
chaalal said. He spoke with an air 
of almost surprised sincerity that con- 
vinced her at once that he was speak- 
ing the truth. She grew hot with 
anger. This was why her husband's 
manner had been strange, furtive 
with her in the morning upon the 
veranda. This was why he had 
tried to avoid her kiss. He had had 
his sport, his pleasure, and now he 
was going to take her away. She 
was to yield to his convenience, to 
forego her desire. 

337 





Patches of red came out on her 
delicate cheeks and her eyes shone. 
Without saying another word she 
walked on again. 

And as she walked she thought that 
her desire of the desert had increased. 
Now that she was not to know the 
desert, it seemed to her that it was 
the one thing which she longed to 
know. 

Benchaalal kept close beside her as 
the gorge narrowed. He read her 
feelings, marked his success. But he 
was too clever to dwell upon Sir 
Claude. Instead he turned to an- 
other subject. He spoke of the des- 
ert, of the strange life there, of the 
freedom, the adventure, the passion. 
And he spoke sincerely, for he loved 
his home, although, like many Arabs, 
he loved also the vices of cities now 
that he had begun to know them. 
He strove to kindle a blaze in the 

imagination of the woman beside him, 
338 



a blaze that would rival the blaze 
of those diamonds which hung at her 
neck, moving as she moved, sparkling 
in the moonlight. They had given 
a mysterious impetus to his desire 
which no one not an Oriental could 
have comprehended. He connected 
them with their wearer, their brill- 
iance with the brilliance of her angry 
eyes, their fairness with the fairness 
of her face, their glitter with the 
glitter of her hair. In his mind he 
compared her to a jewel, to a chain of 
jewels. And as he longed for them 
he longed for her. He desired to take 
them into his hands and to take her 
into his heart. And he spoke like one 
of the Goblin men of Goblin market. 
And she listened as to the voice of a 
Goblin man. 

"Ah!" he exclaimed, at last. "If; 
you were not going to-morrow! Go-/ 
ing back to England!" 

"Perhaps I shall not go," she said. 





There was almost a fierce ring in! 
her clear voice that was no longer 
*?.' petulant. 

" But if your husband is going?" 

"Perhaps I shall not go," she re- 
peated. "We women are not like 
women who are veiled. Western wom- 
en are not slaves." 

"But he will do what he chooses. 
I saw it in his eyes when I spoke with 
him by the river." 

"He is not my master." 

"I should be your slave." 

They were near the mouth of the 
gorge now, and were walking at the 
base of that mountain on, whose sum- 
mit was the rock shaped like a rest- 
ing camel. 

"You must not speak to me like 
that," Lady Wyverne said. 

"I should be your slave," he re- 
peated, as if he had not heard her. 

"But," she answered, with a faint- 
hearted attempt to restore a light 



240 



tone to their conversation "but in 
this land it is the women who are 
like slaves." 

"The dark-skinned women! But 
you you are fair. You are like a 
diamond, one of those diamonds you 
wear." 

His hand went out towards the 
swinging chain instinctively, but he 
drew it back, making a strong effort 
to control himself. 

"The dark men worship the fair 
women. You are like the silver 
moon. You are like the sun when it 
shines upon the great prayer after the 
fast of Ram-a-dan. When I see you 
I am looking at the East. Do you 
not know it?" 

All the time he spoke he was 
watching her craftily. And yet he 
was fiercely moved, and by a double 
desire of possession. Two hearts seem- 
ed beating in his breast, the heart of a 
' robber and the heart of a lover. The 




* 'i 

m 



two controlling passions of the Arab 
were simultaneously alive within him. 
At that moment he was capable of 
falling at Lady Wyverne's feet and 
giving up his life to her, if she would 
yield to him. But he was also capa- 
ble of murdering her for the chain of 
jewels at her neck if she resisted 
him. And this is only to say that he 
was Arab. 

Yet though Benchaalal was on fire 
at this moment and knew not what 
was going to do, what deed of 
,passion or of terror, he never ceased 
to be watchful of his companion. His 
cunning waited for the moment when 
[her face should give him a sign that 
might dare all. 

She had seen his dusky hand go 

t towards the diamonds, and for 
instant had felt a thrill of some- 
"thing that was like repugnance or 
ven fear. But it vanished. For 

e told herself that the gesture was 



an absolutely natural one, according 
with the comparison he made. Never- 
theless, there had been something in 
the look of his hand, as it darted out 
from the folds of his garments, which 
had startled her and left her more 
highly strung than she had been be- 
fore. He knew that, and his following 
speech had been deliberately languid, 
like the speech of a poet of the tents. 

"Do you not know it?" he repeat- 
ed, going a little closer to her, so that/ 
his swinging cloak touched her gently 
as he walked. 

"I turn towards Mecca when I 
pray at dawn, but I turn to you when 
I pray at night. And you, will you 
hear my prayer ?" 

"Hush!" she said. 

She spoke quietly, scarcely with 
reprobation. As she was going to 
see a last vision of the desert, there 
was no reason, surely, why she should 
not listen for the last time to the 




voice of the desert. And in this 
desert man she personified the des- 
ert for the moment. To-morrow the 
vision would have faded from her 
eyes and the voice would have died 
away forever from her ears. Once 
more she would have resumed her 
life with Crumpet. Her sense of re- 
sentment against her husband, too, 
restrained her resentment from fall- 
ing on another. 

In answer to her pretence of re- 
buke he was suddenly silent. They 
walked on very slowly. She heard 
the tap of her high-heeled shoes on 
the hard road, and thought of the tap 
of the shoes on the trottoirs of Paris. 
Then she thought of the look of the 
Spahi's naked feet, that had seemed 
to clasp the river stones like hands, 
-and of how she had dreamed of those 
tfeet padding softly over the desert 
isands, with a woman's feet beside 
them. 

244 




Well, now a woman's feet were 
treading beside them, and towards 
the desert. 

For a moment she gave herself up 
to an imagination. She conceived 
the impossible accomplished. Sup- 
pose she had allowed her caprice to 
develop; suppose she were a 
strong, unbalanced, passionate, 
less woman, instead of merely 
whimsical, pleasure-loving, wilful lit- 
tle creature! Suppose she had been 
carried away, had gone mad over the 
Spahi ! Suppose that they were really 
afoot for the great journey, that the 
lim past was left behind forever, hidden 
Bffll like a dropped burden among the 
HIP! f rocks of the gorge, that the desert was 
opening out before them and that she 
had cast in her lot with the dark 
people of the waste places of the earth ! 
How extraordinary that would be! 
For the moment her feather-headed 
caprice delighted in this imagination, 







245 




played with it like a child with a 
colored ball that floats upward on 
the wind. She forced herself to live 
in this dream. Yes, it was so. Her 
old life was gone forever. She had 
done the strangest thing that ever 
woman had done. How they would 
talk of her in her old haunts, in the 
boudoirs of Paris and of London, on 
the race-courses of Newmarket and 
of Ascot, on the moors of Scotland 
under the misty mountains! What 
would they say of her? Did it mat- 
ter? They were nothing to her any 
more, these friends and acquaintances 
of the past. Their talk would never 
again be her talk, nor their fads and 
their crazes hers. From the tyran- 
nies of fashion she was forever freed, 
from the changing modes of the hour 
and of life. To the immutable East 
she was setting her face, to the land 
that does not change! 

For the moment she was so much 
246 



under the influence of her own de- 
liberate imagination that she almost 
was the woman she thought of, and 
he, the Spahi, almost became to her 
that woman's master. Or slave? 
Which was it? Which would it be? 

Which would it be? 

As she asked herself this question 
she glanced at Benchaalal with an 
expression in her eyes which had 
never been in them before when they 
had looked at him, an expression of 
deep inquiry, so feminine and yet so 
searching that it startled him, and 
added to her personality a charm 
that hitherto it had lacked, the fas- 
cination of mystery. They were 
close to the opening in the gorge. 
The desert lay before them. Al-/ 
ready in the distance they could see // 
it. Their feet were almost touching/ y, 
the fringes of its vastness, and its 
magnetic wind came sighing to their 
cheeks. 







To Benchaalal at this moment it 
seemed as if events rose to a climax 

* almost dramatically arranged by fate. 

,'_ The three visions of the diamonds, 
of his companion's searching eyes, 

v-and of the moon-washed desert to 
which he belonged gave themselves 
to his gaze almost as one. They 
were blended together, fused into a 
whole. And that whole he must 
have it. It must be his, now. He 
could wait for it no longer. The 
jewels, the woman, and the desert 
they must belong to him, now. 

His dark hand shot out again and 
closed on Lady Wyverne's hand. 
He did not speak, but the grasp 
of his hand frightened her It told 
her unmistakably that she w r as in 
danger. It was arbitrary. It was 
the hand of a robber as well as of a 
lover, a hand that could tear to pieces 
as easily, and perhaps almost as 
happily, as it could caress. And his 
248 






eyes now, as they met hers, answered 
the question hers had asked them, 
answered it with a fierce frankness 
that left no room for doubt. The 
barbarian forced his way up into the 
light, splitting through the thin crust 
of civilized culture that had covered 
him, as an iron bar splits through a 
pane of glass. 

The desert came upon Lady Wy- 
verne and the desert man came upon 
her, showing himself exactly as he 
was. 

When his hand seized her hand she 
instinctively recoiled. Instantly his 
other hand shot out, and seized, not 
her other hand, but the diamond 
chain at her neck. 

The whole man was nakedly re- 
1% vealed in those two quickly following 
actions. 

As the Spahi's thin fingers closed 

s ._ upon the diamonds Lady Wyverne 

^ knew the depth of her folly, and 





there came to her a sickening horror 
in which the desert was condemned 
with the man. Tradition rushed 
back to the place in her nature from 
which her caprice had ousted it. Her 
heart clamored for the blessed pro- 
tection of the commonplace which she 
had been rejecting, and the peculiar 
disgust which so many white-skinned 
people feel towards the dark races of 
the earth suddenly rose up in her, 
rose to the level of her husband's. 

All this vehement recoil of her 
[nature the Spahi felt as it was born. 
j His right hand abandoned her hand 
land joined its greedy brother on her 
! jewels. The lover in him, rejected, 
[became the parent of the passionate 
: robber. 

His hands tore at the diamonds. 

Hidden among the rocks to the 
j left of the road, a watching man had, 
| for some seconds, which seemed to 



him long nights of impenetrable 
blackness, held a gun to his shoulder 
with a steady hand, his finger upon 
the trigger. One reason alone had 
prevented him from firing, a strange 
but tremendous indecision in his 
heart. 

He did not know whether he wished 
to shoot the woman or the man upon 
the road. 

While he waited, still as the rocks 
which concealed him, the woman 
started back from the Spahi, and the 
Spahi's hand left her hand and darted 
at her jewels. 

Then the man among the rocks 
knew. He moved slightly and he 
levelled his gun at the Spahi. 

But before he could fire there came 
upon the Spahi a rushing figure, whose 
bright-green robe showed clearly in 
the moonbeams; and the hands that 
clutched the diamonds broke the 
chain that united them, as the Spahi 





sank down upon the road with a 
knife between his shoulders. 
"Allah! Allah! Allah!" 
The long, fierce cry went up in the 
night. 

Sir Claude leaped into the road. 
As his arms went round his wife the 
cry rose up again. 

"Allah! Allah! Allah!" 
Then it died away in a whimper 
that was like an animal's, as the mad 
Marabout dropped down to his knees 
beside the Spahi's body, and began 
carefully to pick up, one by one, the 
jewels that w r ere scattered over it, 
gleaming in the moonbeams like crys- 
tals of the desert. 

When day dawned the Arab boy 
strolled lazily along the bank of the 
river till he reached his nook in the 
ocks. There he squatted down, 
bided his burnous round his slim 
body, drew forth from his breast his 



little flute of reed, and, putting his 
dusky fingers to the holes, sent forth 
airily to the sun the melody that was 
like caprice personified in music.
