PREFACE 

OU R first word must be one of our sincere 
and appreciative acknowledgments to the 
Writer and Illustrator of the incomparable Alice 
Books — to Lewis Carroll, the one man who, 
if he had only been alive, could have made 
head or tail of Mr. Chamberlain s figures, and 
to Sir John Tenniel, happily still in our midst, 
even though each succeeding Wednesday no 
longer brings with it an example of his genius. 
It will be noticed that in the Fiscal Wonder- 
land one actor has to sustain more than one of 
the characters of the Alice dramatis personce. 
Mr. Balfour is not only Humpy Dumpy, but 
also the March Hare ; Mr. Chamberlain is at 
once the Mad Hatter, the Cheshire Cat, and 
the Knave of the Trial. For this we make 
no apology, since one man in his time plays

many pa/ts, and in this fiscal controversy the 
time has been as short as the parts have been 
varied. 

The Hatter's riddle (on page 62) as in- 
vented had not an answer any more than 
Lewis Carroll's original working model, but 
if an answer be desired, '* Because neither can 
be obtained from Birmingham " would seem to 
have the merit of accuracy. 

In writing and illustrating the Fiscal Wonder- 
land, we do not pretend to having had no 
settled convictions. But whilst these have 
not been concealed, we venture to hope that 
none of the combatants in the Big Fight will 
find any cause of offence in this new version of 
the old stories, so much of which now seems 
only an intelligent anticipation of the present 
political situation.

JOHN BULL'S ADVENTURES IN 
THE FISCAL WONDERLAND 

CHAPTER I 
THROUGH THE FISCAL GLASS 

JOHN BULL sat in an easy-chair before 
the fireplace, but he was not by any means 
at ease. He had been reading the Blue Books 
of the War Commission, and his muttered 
comments as he turned over page after page 
of imbecilities branded in type were, like the 
covers, dark blue. 

At last he flung the books *down impatiently 
and threw himself back in his chair. 

**Good heavens!" he exclaimed, '*its a 
wonder I even muddled through." And then 
he said bang words which were not very 
respectful to distinguished statesmen. 



2 JOHN BULKS ADVENTURES 

** Two hundred and fifty millions of money 
it has cost me ! '' he growled, and then he 
began to think what he could have done with 
all that money if he had not had to spend it. 

All sorts of fanciful ideas crossed and re- 
crossed his mind, until the tangled web made 
him drowsy, and the Blue Books faded into 
grey and vanished. 



He was aroused by a sound as of someone 
tapping at a window, and he opened his eyes 
and sat up. In front of him on the mantel- 
shelf was a large pier-glass, with a clock in the 
middle of the shelf, and a stuffed parrakeet 
under a glass case on either side. It was 
these objects that first attracted his attention, 
for they seemed to have changed in some 
magic way. 

The face of the clock had turned into Mr. 
Arthur Balfour s, and the heads of the two 
parrakeets into those of Mr. Henry Chaplin 
and Sir Howard Vincent. John rubbed his 
eyes and looked again. But there could be 
no doubt about it, for the Howard Vincent 



THROUGH THE FISCAL GLASS 3 

bird every now and then uttered the loud 
**Yah-yah" so familiar to the House of 
Commons, and the other had an eyeglass 
firmly fixed in the left eye. 




THE BALFOUR CLOCK 



There was something strange, too, about the 
pier-glass. 

Across it sprawled large white figures in the 
form of a sum in addition — 

2 + 2 = 3 

The last figure certainly was 3 when John 



4 JOHN BULKS ADVENTURES 

first noticed it, but presently it began to flicker, 
and then it appeared as 5, only to waver back 
again to 3. John watched this singular ap- 
parition with a sort of fascination, expecting 
each moment to see the correct result figured. 

But no, the sum went on alternating be- 
tween 3 and 5, with never a 4. John began 
to get annoyed. 

'* Hang it ! Why can't you get your sum 
right?'' he exclaimed. 

Of course the glass could not tell him, for 
fortunately mirrors can't speak what they 
think. 

But the clock began to strike, and it struck 
six ; at least John tried to believe so, but the 
strokes seemed to him to have the sound of 
spoken words, and the words were — 

No — set — tied — con — vie — tions. 

And the parrakeet on the left shouted " Yah- 
yah." 

*' No settled convictions!" John snorted 
contemptuously. *' More like previous ones," 
and he glanced at the Blue Books. 

The ridiculous addition sum went on working 



THROUGH THE FISCAL GLASS 5 

itself out wrong until John jumped up from his 
chair in a rage, picked up one of the books 
from the floor and flunor it at the orlass. 




THE FISCAL GLASS 



To his astonishment neither was there any 
smash of broken glass, nor did the book re- 



fi JOHN BULi;S ADVENTURES 

bound : it just went noiselessly through and 
disappeared, apparently on the other side. 

** There can't be any glass there at all," he 
thought ; ** it must be an open space.'* 




THE VINCENT PARRAKEET 



And yet the silly sum was there still. 
'* I must look into this business," John said 
to himself; ** there's something weird going on." 
So he looked round the room to find some 



THROUGH THE FISCAL GLASS 7 

way of clambering on to the mantelshelf. 
There was a pile of the Encyclopcedia Brit- 
annica in one corner ; he had bought them 




^^CL^ 



THE CHAPLIN PARRAKEET 



because it was the only way he could stop 
the dumping of circulars and samples into his 
letter-box. 



8 JOHN BULKS ADVENTURES 

** Wisdom whilst you wait," he said, with a 
smile. ** Tm glad I got them, after all " ; and 
he proceeded to pile the volumes one upon 
another. *' Tm glad Moberly Bell can't see 
me, or he'd use it as another advertisement,'' 
he thought, as he put on his hat — for he didn't 
know where he might be going — climbed 
the massive pile, and clambered on to the 
mantelshelf, to the manifest delight of the 
two parrakeets under the glass shades. The 
pier-glass offered no resistance ; like the one 
in Alice's adventures, it melted away in a 
bright silvery mist, and the next moment 
John was through on the other side. 



CHAPTER II 
THE FISCAL PARADE GROUND 

JOHN found himself in a large, square, level 
space enclosed by high walls, on which in 
gigantic letters the word ''tariffs" was painted 
at intervals all round, and the tops of the walls 
were prickly with spikes and broken glass. 

*' It looks like a parade ground," John said. 
And so it evidently was, for in the middle of 
the square a battalion of very queer-looking 
soldiers was drawn up in close military forma- 
tion. 

No wonder they looked queer, for when 
John got a little nearer to them he found they 
were all large quartern loaves, drawn up as if 
to be drilled or inspected. 

There was no band ; only a very big drum, 
and that was being vigorously banged by a 
portly drummer, who marched backward and 
forward in front of the column, thumping the 

9 



10 JOHN BULi;S ADVENTURES 

drum part of '* Rule Britannia." He wore a 
splendid, very early nineteenth-century uni- 
form, with a tremendously tall shako, orna- 
mented with a towering red, white, and blue 
plume. 

John was watching this strange parade, when 
he heard a stentorian '* Shun ! " from some- 
where behind him, accompanied by a loud, 
metallic clanging and jangling noise. 

**This must be the colonel or the inspecting 
officer," he thought. 

He looked round and saw a sort of mediaeval 
White Knight, encased in a complete suit of 
tinplate armour which looked like riveted steel 
boiler-plates. He was jogging along towards 
the battalion in front of him on a white horse. 

" I know that Knight ; he comes from 
Sheffield," John remarked to himself 

There was nothing remarkable in the fact 
of this recognition, for the words '' Made in 
Sheffield" were printed on his breastplate. 
From the pommel and the cantle of the saddle 
dangled a queer collection of things of various 
kinds, like samples of an ironmonger's stock. 

''Shun!" shouted the Knight, as he pulled 




THE DRUMMER AND THE LOAVES 



12 JOHN BULKS ADVENTURES 

up his horse in front of the regiment of loaves. 
*' Shun ! Royal salute ! Present arms ! " 

The big drummer changed his percussive 
tune to fit the National Anthem, and the 
Knight of Sheffield sat rigidly upright and stiff, 
with his right gauntlet raised to his helmet 
in salute. 

But the quartern loaves never moved a 
crumb and stood stolidly still. 

Then the drummer stopped his banging, 
and the Knight shouted, '* Pro — tection!'' 

No sooner was the word out of his mouth 
than the loaves all began to shrink in a weird 
and mysterious way, as if they were in a 
haunted farm, getting smaller and smaller. 

** As you were ! " shouted the Knight ex- 
citedly. 

Immediately the loaves resumed their nor- 
mal size. 

The Knight glared sternly at them. 

'* At the last sound of the word ' Protection ' 
let me see every loaf pull itself together, throw 
its chest out, and look as big as possible. 

** Now, then," he went on, '*all together. 
Pro — tection ! " 



THE FISCAL PARADE GROUND 13 

The loaves immediately began to dwindle 

ain. 

** As you were ! " the Knight yelled, as he 



agam

TAK»fFS 




THE WHITE KNIGHT OF SHEFFIELD 



galumphed up and down. '* This won't do 
at all ! Where's your discipline ? 

** Now then, once more," he shouted, when 
he had cooled down a little. '* We'll try it 



14 JOHN BULKS ADVENTURES 

again. I want you to look bigger, and not 
smaller at the word of command." 

^^Pro—tec—tion!'' 

The loaves instantly began to shrink as 
before, and if the Knight of Sheffield had not 
had the presence of mind to shout ** As you 
were ! " just in time, they might have dis- 
appeared altogether. 

The Knight was terribly angry, and presently 
he called up the big drummer, and the two 
talked together in a very excited manner. 
' When the conversation was ended the Knight 
turned to the regiment again and gave another 
word of command. 

** The loaves will advance in price ! Quick 
march ! '* 

This time the loaves seemed as if they were 
going to obey, only instead of advancing at the 
quick step they started at the double and 
rushed straight towards the officer yelling 
** Yah- yah ! " as they swept forward. 

'•Halt! halt!" the Knight shouted, but it 
was unheeded ; the loaves had got thoroughly 
out of hand, and raced on in an irresistible 
wave. 



THE FISCAL PARADE GROUND 



16 



The Knight gazed for a moment in speech- 
less fury at the threatening mass of loaves, and 
then he hastily pulled his horse s head round 
and rode off clattering as fast as he could get 
his horse to lay its legs to the ground, all the 




THE BROKEN DRUM 



ironmongery stock banging and clanging as 
they went. 

" At any rate, I'm leading them ! '' he shouted 
to John Bull as he galloped past with the 
loaves yelling at his heels. 

In a moment they were out of sight, leaving 



16 JOHN BULUS ADVENTURES 

nothing behind but the big drummer, who had 
been knocked over in the charge, and who was 
sitting on the ground beside his broken drum, 
ruefully trying to get his battered shako into 
shape again. 



CHAPTER III 

THE WHITE RABBIT EXPLAINS 

"pvEAR me!'* said John Bull, *^this is a 
^-^ curious sort of place ; I wish I could 
find someone to tell me something about it." 
He had hardly wished when a little White 
Rabbit — at least, it looked like a White Rabbit 
— ran hastily past him. 

'* Hi ! hi!" John shouted; *'stop a minute. 
Could you kindly tell me " 

'* Oh, please don't stop me ! " cried the Rabbit, 
reluctantly turning round. '' I'm so busy, and 
I'm late already." It took a large turnip watch 
out of its pocket and looked anxiously at it. 

** What's the name of this queer place ? " 
John asked. 

'' Its Tariff-land," said the White Rabbit ; 
** and it isn't a queer place ; it's very beautiful." 

'* But why has it got high walls all round ? " 
John wanted to know. 

C 17

JOHN BULKS ADVENTURES 



*^0h!" said the White Rabbit eagerly, 
'*thats Mr. Josephs own invention. It's to 
stop Dumping, you know/* 

** Dumping ! What is that ? " John asked. 




THE RABBIT LOOKS AT HIS WATCH 

** It s a lot of nasty, horrid foreigners trying 
to sell us things we want cheaper than we want 
to pay for them," said the White Rabbit. 

'* That's a funny idea," John remarked. 
''Your country won't get very fat on that." 



THE WHITE RABBIT EXPLAINS 19 

** Not get fat ? " the White Rabbit exclaimed 
indignantly. *'You should just see our Pigs ; 
they're beautiful ! " 




THE PIG SINGS 



'*But what do they get fat on?" John 
asked. 

*' Maize!" said the White Rabbit proudly. 



20 JOHN BULKS ADVENTURES 

** Mr. Joseph lets the maize come in because 
the Pigs like it. There's one coming along 
now/' he went on. ** Isn't he splendid ! " And 
the White Rabbit pointed to an extremely fat 
Pig waddling across the enclosure. ** Would 
you like to hear the Pig sing ? " 

John Bull said he would, so the White 
Rabbit beckoned the Pig towards them. ** Sing 
your ' Beautiful Maize ' song to this gentleman, 
will you, old fellow ? " 

The Pig sighed, and said he had a bad cold, 
but he would try. Then he struck an attitude 
and began to sing in a very throaty voice — 

Beautiful Maize I that looks like goldy 
Loveliest cereal ever sold I 
Who wouldn't live on it all his days ? 
Maize of the morning, beautiful Maize ! 
Maize of the mornings beautiful Maize ! 

BeaU'Ootiful Ma-aize ! 

Beau-ootiful Ma-aize ! 
Ma-aize of the mo-mo-viorning. 

Beautiful^ beautiful Maize! 

Beautiful Bacon I who can feel 
Fond of mutton^ beef or veal? 
Who would not fly ^ the world forsaken^ 
In order to. save his beautiful Bacon ? 
In order to save his beautiful Bacon ?

BeaU'Ootiful Ma-aize ! 

BeaU'OOtiful Ba-acon ! 

Ma-aize of the mo-mo-morning^ 

Beautiful, beauti'Y\3\. BACON ! 

When the Pig had finished, John thanked 
him politely, and the Pig waddled off. 




THE RABBIT GETS EXCITED 



*' By-the-by," said John to the White 
Rabbit, *'you spoke of Mr. Joseph just now. 
Do you mean Joe '' 

The White Rabbit gave a little scream of 
horror, and stamped its feet angrily. 



22 JOHN BULKS ADVENTURES 

" You shut up ! " it cried ; '* I won't have it ! 
You mustn't speak of him like that ! If you 
were in Birmingham they would know how to 
treat you. My Mr. Joseph is a Great States- 
man ! " and the White Rabbit glared very 
fiercely at John and shook its umbrella at 
him. 

** I didn't mean to speak disrespectfully of 
him," John said. '* Where is he now? Does 
he live here ? " 

** He's playing at a Cabinet card-party," the 
White Rabbit whispered mysteriously, ''and 
I'm just going to see them shoot out of the 
chimney." 

*' What do you mean by going to see them 
shoot out of the chimney ? Who are ' them'.'^ " 

**The others, of course," said the White 
Rabbit, ** the ones Mr. Joseph is playing 
against." 

** Curiouser and curiouser," said John Bull 
to himself — ^just as Alice did once. *' But 
what game are they playing ? Whist ? " 

'* It isn't exactly Whist," the White Rabbit 
replied ; '* it's a sort of Whist, but that's not 
the name of it." 



THE WHITE RABBIT EXPLAINS 23 

** Is it Poker?" John asked. 

'*Yes, that's it," the White Rabbit said, 
"Red Hot Poker!" 

** Rather a warm sort of game," John re- 
marked ; *' but how do you know the others 
are going to get the worst of it ? " 

'*0h! they're sure to," the White Rabbit 
said eagerly. *' Mr. Joseph always shuffles the 
cards." 

The White Rabbit looked at its watch 
again. '' My goodness gracious ! " it exclaimed, 
** you Ve kept me so long I shan't get there in 
time," and off it ran. 

John hurried after it, for he didn't want to 
lose sight of his guide. And as he followed 
the White Rabbit it struck him that another 
strange thing had happened. He had actually 
shrunk in size until he was no bigger than the 
Rabbit. 

''It's very awkward," he thought, **but I 
may as well see it through now I'm here." 



CHAPTER IV 

IN DOWNING STREET 

nPHE White Rabbit ran so fast that it was 
^ as much as John could do to keep it in 
sight, and at last, when it turned sharply round 
a corner, it disappeared altogether. 

John followed as quickly as he could and 
found himself at the end of a narrow street. 
He looked up to see if he could find the name. 
It was Downing Street, but he noticed some- 
thing else as well, for suddenly, out of a chim- 
ney a little way along the street, popped a large 
lizard, followed immediately by another. 

There was a loud noise as if a crowd of 
people were watching sky-rockets let off, and 
shouts of ** Here they come ! " 

The two lizards whizzed up very high in the 
air, and then curved gracefully away and dis- 
appeared. 

Nothing was to be seen of the White Rabbit, 
24 




THE LIZARDS SHOOT OUT 



26 JOHN BULUS ADVENTURES 

but presently John heard the sounds of the 
running feet of a crowd and a tremendous 
shouting and screams of '* He's out! He's 
loose ! " A Lion and a Unicorn came running 
along, hotly arguing with each other. John 
Bull was not accustomed to see Lions and 
Unicorns in his daily walks, and he ought to 
have been startled ; but there, was something 
about this queer, place which prevented him 
from being surprised at anything. So he 
called out to the two strange creatures — 

** Excuse me, gentlemen, could you kindly 
tell me what it is that has got loose ? " 

'' It s a very large, fierce, ramping, raging, 
tearing Dog ! " said the Lion breathlessly. 

** I beg your pardon," said the Unicorn 
scornfully, ''your eyesight must be defective. 
It was a gentleman in a large hat ; the — er — 
Mad Hatter, in fact!" 

The Lion snorted angrily. '' I tell you it 
was a Dog ! " he insisted. 

The Unicorn sniffed contempt. *' It was the 
Hatter ! " he declared. 

** But I made a sketch of it," exclaimed the 
Lion, '*and here it is. Now is that a Hatter?" 



IN DOWNING STREET 



m 



he asked, triumphantly flourishing a drawing 
of a Dog with an eyeglass and in violent 
action. 

**Wait a moment," said the Unicorn. *' Is 
that a Dog?" and he produced and waved 




A.^ 



THE LION AND THE UNICORN 



before John's eyes a sketch, of an unmistakable 
Mad Hatter. 

'* I'll fight you for a crown ! " said the Lion, 
and then without another word the Lion and 
the Unicorn dropped their drawings, and began 
to rotate round each other in fighting attitudes. 

A crowd quickly gathered, but John kept 



28 JOHN BULUS ADVENTURES 

clear of the ring, for he thought it extremely 
silly to fight about the matter. But he could 
see in the middle of the crowd the rough head 
of the Lion and the horn of the Unicorn whirl- 
ing round and round faster and faster. It struck 
John as another strange thing that he could see 
so well, for only a few minutes before he had 
been no bigger than the White Rabbit, so he 
came to the conclusion that he had acquired the 
property of sliding in and out like a telescope. 
And he had not been long in the Fiscal Wonder- 
land before he found that this was exactly what 
had happened. 

** They're at it again!" said a gentle voice 
by his side. 

John looked round and saw a slim figure 
standing in a stained-glass, Anglo-Saxon atti- 
tude. ** Pardon me," said John, **but your 
figure is familiar to me. Have I met you 
before ? " 

**Very likely," was the answer. **My name 
is Hugha, and I am an Anglo-Saxon messenger. 
Permit me to give you a tract," and he took 
a pamphlet out of a large bag which he carried 



IN DOWNING STREET 



29 



on his left side, labelled ** Free Food League," 
handed it to John, and hurried away round 
the nearest corner. 




HUGHA, THE ANGLO-SAXON MESSENGER 



John took it, and saw at a glance that it was 
poetry of some kind, but it seemed to be printed 
in some strange characters. 



30 JOHN BULKS ADVENTURES 

It began like this —

ASN[aMH3.H[iiaHJ 

John puzzled over it, but for a time could 
make nothing either of the language or the 
lettering. 

''It's an upside-down sort of a place," he 
muttered to himself ''I'll try it that way/' 

It was a happy thought, for, after all, it was 
only printed upside down, and this was the 

poem Prefferwensy 

' Twas inaffig^ and the bruviiny coves 
Did cirk and cristle on the trade ; 

All iniinsy were the quarternloaves, 
A nd the tome balfs outplade, 

" Beware the Prefferwense, my son I 

The taxes that retaliate I 
Beware the Joejoe bird and shun 

The jubious Seventydate !^' 

He took his Cobden club in hand, 

Long time the bunkome foe he sought, 

So rested he by the Brumbrum tree, 
And stood awhile and thought. 



I 




PREFFERWENSY 



32 JOHN BULKS ADVENTURES 

And as in loafish thought he stood. 
The Prefferwense, with eye of flame ^ 

Came piffling through the fiscey wood 
And shibbolled as it came. 

One, two ! And through the 72 

The Cobden club went snicker-snack ! ' 

He left it dead and with its head 
Went rollickeering back, 

" And hast thou slain the Prefferwense ? 

Come to my arms, my gladdish boy ! 
O dumpless day I Loaffooh I Loaffay ! " 

He chortled in his joy, 

' Twas maffig, and the brummy coves 
Did cirk and cristle on the trade ; 

All mimsy were the quarternloaves. 
And the tome balfs outpiade. 

*' It s funny,'* he said when he had finished 
it, *' but it's rather hard to understand. I seem 
to recognise some of it, and it's evident that 
something dangerous has got loose and has to 
be knocked on the head." 

He turned round to see if he could find any- 
one to explain the meaning of some of the 
words, but everybody had vanished. 

** I'd better see if I can get back through 
that glass and into my armchair again," he said, 
and he walked away down the street the way 
he had come. 



CHAPTER V 
HUMPY DUMPY 

JOHN BULL had not gone very far when 
he heard a voice hailing him. He looked 
round and saw a queer-looking figure perched 
on a wall. At first he thought it was an egg, 
but as he went nearer it grew larger and 
larger, and more and more human, and he saw 
that it had eyes and a nose and mouth. 

** It must be Humpy Dumpy ; it can't be any- 
body else ! " he said to himself 

Humpy Dumpy was sitting on the top of a 
high wall ; such a narrow one that John 
wondered how he could keep his balance. 

John couldn't help repeating to himself — 

Humpy Dumpy sat on a wall ; 

Humpy Dumpy had a great fall ; 

All the King^s horses and all the King's men 

Had considerable difficulty in putting Humpy 

Dumpy in his place again, 
^ 33

JOHN BULKS ADVENTURES 



" That last line's too long ! " said Humpy 
Dumpy crossly ; " it isn't poetry/' 




*' It mayn't be 
poetry/' said John, 
'* but it s a fact all 

the same/' 

" YouVe rude/' 
said Humpy Dumpy. 
*' I don't like your 
methods ; they Ve so 
CHffordish!" 

** How did you get 
up there on that wall?" 
John asked, to change the conversation. 



HUMPY DUMPY ON THE WALL 



{ 



HUMPY DUMPY 86 

Humpy Dumpy looked puzzled. " I suppose 
I must have played on to it," he said. 

**Then youVe what they call bunkered," 
John remarked. 

** No, Tm not," Humpy Dumpy replied 
indignantly. 

** But you would be if you fell off," John said. 

**Fall off!" Humpy Dumpy exclaimed, with 
a look of surprise. ** Why, if ever I did fall 
off — which there s no chance of — but if I 

did " Here he pursed up his lips and 

looked so solemn and mysterious that John 
could hardly help laughing. '' If \ did fall," 
he went on, ''Joe has promised me — ah, you 
may turn pale, if you like ! You didn't think 
I was going to say that, did yon}— Joe has 
promised me — with his very own mouth — to — 
to " 

^' To be loyal to you," John interrupted 
rather unwisely. 

*' Now I declare that s too bad ! " Humpy 
Dumpy cried, breaking into a sudden passion. 
" YouVe been listening at Cabinet doors — and 
behind trees — and down chimneys — and peep- 



36 JOHN BULUS ADVENTURES 

ing into envelopes — or you couldn't have known 

It!" 

' " I haven't, indeed ! " John said soothingly. 

" It s all been in the papers." 

** Ah well ! They may put such things in 
the papers. I never read them," Humpy 
Dumpy said loftily. **Now take a good look 
at me," he went on. ** Tm a Leader, and I 
mean to lead ; maybe you'll never see such 
another, and to show you Im not proud — you 
may buy my little book, price one shilling — 
but you mustn't on any account quote more 
than a thousand words from it," and he smiled 
sweetly as he leant forward (and as nearly as 
possible fell off the wall in doing so) and offered 
John the book. 

** I don't want it," said John, "and even if 
I did, I shouldn't think of paying a shilling 
for it." 

Humpy Dumpy looked pained. 

** It's an imputation on my personal honour," 
he said. 

** Nonsense ! " said John. 

** Your insularity is something shocking," 
said Humpy Dumpy very severely. 



( 



HUMPY DUMPY 87 

*' Would you tell me, please," said John, 
*' what that means ? " 

*' You'd have found it in my little book if you 
had only bought it, as I wanted you to, but I 
don't mind telling you. I meant by * insularity ' 
that if you go on as you are doing now, and 
don't do as other people do, you'll do for your- 
self." 

** You seem very clever at using words, sir," 
said John; ** perhaps you could help me to 
understand what some mean. Would you 
kindly tell me the meaning of the poem 'Preffer- 
wensy ' ? " 

*' Let's hear it," said Humpy Dumpy. " I've 
never found a poem yet I couldn't under- 
stand." 

That sounded promising, so John repeated 
the first verse — 

'Twas maffigy and the brummy coves 
Did cirk and cristle on the trade ; 

All mimsy were the quarternloaveSy 
And the tome balfs outplade. 

** That'll do for a start," Humpy Dumpy 
interrupted ; " there are plenty of hard words 
to begin on. ' Maffig ' means eleven o'clock at 



38 JOHN BULKS ADVENTURES 

night — the time when you maffick and tickle 
each other with teasers and peacock's feathers." 




PREFFERWENSY EXPLAINED 



** That's quite plain," said John; **and 
* brummy ' ? '' 



HUMPY DUMPY 89 

** Well, 'brummy' means *brum and rummy.' 
*Brum' is just short for Brummagem. It's a 
portmanteau word — the sort that Lewis Carroll 
invented." 

" I see it now," said John thoughtfully. 
** And what are ' coves ' "i " 

** Well, * coves * are something like dodgers — 
they're something like Tories — and they're 
something like turncoats." 

** They must be very curious creatures." 

** So they are," said Humpy Dumpy ; "also 
they make their nests in Government offices ; 
also they live on orchids." 

** And what are to ' cirk ' and to ' cristle ' ? " 

**To 'cirk' is to go round and round in a 
circle till you don't know where you are. To 
'cristle' is to make crystals like a wanklyn." 

"And the 'trade'}'' 

"Oh, the less said about the 'trade' the 
better," said Humpy Dumpy. 

" Isn't it a thing with a yoke that you feel ? " 
said John, moved to make a suggestion. 

**Of course it is. Well, then, 'mimsy,' as 
everybody knows, means * flimsy and miser- 
able.' And a ' quarternloave' is a comic- 



40 JOHN BULUS ADVENTURES 

looking thing, something like a double crinoline 
— with a big dimple on top." 

**And then 'tome bal/s'}'' said John. 
'' Though that sounds dreadfully difficult." 

** It is, rather. A 'half is a sort of child, 
rather like me ; but ' tome ' is a real puzzler. 
I think it must be * not at home ' — meaning 
that they were unsettled down in their convic- 
tions, you know." 

"Yes, I think I do know,*' said John, looking 
as if he remembered. **And what does ^ out- 
plade ' mean ? " 

**Well, 'outplaying' means playing out and 
out and never getting home. However, you 11 
see it done maybe — down on the links yonder 
— and when you ve once seen it you'll be quite 
content. Wherever did you get hold of all 
that hard stuff?" 

** I read that in a book," said John. *' But 
I heard some poetry recited that was a good 
deal easier." 

"As to poetry, you know," said Humpy 
Dumpy, "/ can repeat poetry if Tm really 
put to it " 

"Oh, I shouldn't like to put you to anything," 



HUMPY DUMPY 41 

said John, though he felt that he was in for 
another recitation. 

** The piece I am going to repeat/' he 
went on, ** was written entirely for my own 
amusement." 

John thought that in that case it was very 
hard lines he should have to listen to it, but 
rather than offend Humpy Dumpy, he sat 
down and said, '* Thank you," looking a little 
apprehensive. 

In Downing Street^ when it is night, 
I troll this song for sheer delight, 

'' I don't really troll it," he explained, ** be- 
cause of the policemen." 

In Scotland when the links are green^ 
ril try and tell you what I mean. 

** Thank you very much," said John, **but 
you ought to know my handicap is thirty-six." 

** All the better," said Humpy Dumpy, as he 
proceeded. 

In Parliament, next Walter Long, 
I sometimes sing this simple song. 

In autumn, when we're out of town. 
Take pen and ink and write this down. 



42 JOHN BULL^ ADVENTURES 

** Of course, if you sing it in Parliament," 
said John, ** I can read it in the papers." 

** Oh, I never read the papers," said Humpy 
Dumpy rather testily; **theyVe not sensible, 
and they put me out." 

/ only sent him private word, 

" / think so, though it seems absurd'' 

I sent a summons to the rest, 

Their clothes were just their second best 

They sat around and talked away, 
It seemed the best part of a day, 

** It seems to be quite simple so far," said 
John, rather pleased at understanding so much. 

" Oh, it gets harder all right later on," 
Humpy Dumpy replied. 

He told them once, he told them twice. 
They would not listen to advice. 

The only thing I dared to say 
Was " Better let him have his way!' 

They only answered, with a grin, 
" Why, what a temper you are in !" 

He said to them, he said it plain, 
" Then I shall not be here again!' 

He said it very loud and clear. 
He whispered it in Austen's ear. 



HUMPY DUMPY 43 

I felt the letter large and new. 
Fit for the deed I had to do. 

My heart went thumps my heart went hop. 
He signalled me to let it stop. 




**HE WHISPERED IT IN AUSTEN's EAR " 

So no one knew of it because 
I left the letter zvhere it was. 

Then someone came to me and said, 
" Against this game we four are dead!' 



44 JOHN BULKS ADVENTURES 

/ said^ ^^ Just see the other three^ 
And bring their answers back to me'' 

Humpy Dumpy spoke in a whisper as he re- 
peated the verse, and John thought, with a 
shudder, ** I wouldn't have been the messenger 
for anything/' 

He brought them, I did notjorget 
To send them on to the " Gazette!' 

I showed the letter large and new^ 
It did the trick I wanted to. 

I spoke at lengthy and all agreed 
That only I was fit to lead. 

But he was riled (Dukes often are) 
And said, " You shouldn't go so far!' 

And he (Dukes often are) was riled; 

He said, " / thought you were a child " 

He took a form from off the shelf 
And went and wired it off himselj. 

And when I found he'd bolted too, 
I made no end of a to-do. 

And he who wrote the letter said, 
" If only / had known instead " 

There was a long, painful pause. 
" Is that all ? " John timidly asked. 
** That s all for the present," said Humpy 
Dumpy. " Good-bye. " 



HUMPY DUMPY 46 

This was rather sudden, but John thought 
it would be rude to stay after this strong hint. 
So having thanked Humpy Dumpy for all the 
poetry, John took the only path there seemed 
to be, and wondered what he should do when 
the roads divided. But whenever they did 
there were sure to be two finger-posts pointing 
the same way, one marked ''to tweedle-r.*s 
TABERNACLE," and the other " to the taber- 
nacle OF TWEE-C.-B.*' 

'* I do believe," John said at last, " that they 
must be living now in the same tabernacle. 
But from what they told me I never thought 
that possible." 

Just as he said that he turned a corner, and 
there were two little men. This was all so 
sudden that John gave a start, but he pulled 
himself together, for he felt now that they 
must be 



CHAPTER VI 

TWEEDLE-R. AND TWEE-C.-B. 

'TPHEY were standing under a tree, with 
-*■ their arms lovingly entwined about each 
other s neck, and John Bull had no difficulty at 
all in knowing which was which, because one of 
them had ** R." embroidered on his collar, and 
the other *X.-B." 

They stood stock still, and John quite forgot, 
in the excitement of the moment, that they 
were alive. He was just looking to see whether 
the rest of their names was written at the backs 
of their collars, when all at once a voice came 
from the one marked ** R/' 

*' If you think we're enemies," he said, **youVe 
not up to date, you know. The Education 
Act wasn't passed for nothing, nohow ! " 

** Contrariwise," added the one marked 
** C.-B.," *' if you think weVe friends, you ought 
to speak." 

46 



TWEEDLE-R. AND TWEE-C.-B. 



47 



" Tm sure Tm very sorry," said John. 
That, indeed, was all he could think of to 
say, for when he looked at the two little men 




THE TWO HEROES 



the words of the old song kept running through 
his head like the paddle-wheel of a steamer, 
and he actually found himself saying them out 
loud — 



48 JOHN BULKS ADVENTURES 

Tweedle-R, and Twee-C.-B, 

Were fightings very nearly ; 
For Twee-C*-B, said Tweedle-R. 

Had made his pitch play queerly. 

Just then they saw a grinning cat^ 

As big as a beer barrel y 
Which frightened both the heroes that 
They swore no more to quarrel, 

** I hear everything you're saying," said 
Tweedle-R. ; **and so it is, anyhow/' 

*' Similarly," continued Twee-C.-B., **as it 
was, so it had to be ; and as it might have 
been, it hadn't any need to be ; but as it is, 
it is. That's logic." y 

John thought this was much too puzzling, 
so he thought he would ask them how they 
had made it up. 

** Please," said John very politely, *' every- 
body was quite certain you could never be 
friends any more." 

*' We couldn't," said Tweedle-R., **that was 
exactly what I said." 

** But we are, you see," said Twee-C.-B. 
rather quickly and (so John thought) ner- 
vously. 



TWEEDLE-R. AND TWEE-C.-B. 49 

** You couldnty but you are'' said John ; 
" Tm afraid I don't understand." 

** Well, you see," said Tweedle-R., "its like 
this,. If some morning at breakfast someone 
wanted you to go to bed and sleep, you'd say, * I 
couldniy but if they came and looked at you 
after supper they'd find you sleeping and say, 
'Youarer' 

John thought this rather far-fetched, but he 
didn't say so ; indeed he didn't say anything, 
for all at once Twee-C.-B., who seemed to 
have been turning something over in his mind, 
said, "All the same, I don't think you need 
have thrown the olive branch at me." 

** I don't think you should have asked me 
the question," retorted Tweedle-R., taking 
away his arm from off Twee-C.-B. 's neck. 

** You're too touchy," said Twee-C.-B., who 
by this time had also taken away his arm. 

John was very frightened at this, because he 
was afraid that all the old trouble would begin 
over again. But suddenly they both put their 
arms round each other's neck again, looking 
very scared. 

E

JOHN BULUS ADVENTURES 



** The Cat," they said together in a frightened 
voice. 

John followed the direction of their eyes, 
and there up in a tree was a large Cat grinning 
at them all. 

No one said a word, and as they looked 




THE VANISHING CAT 



it vanished quite slowly, till nothing but the 
grin remained. At last even that went too. 

" I hope youVe not very much frightened ? " 
said John by way of saying something. 

** Nohow. And thank you for not running 
away,*' said Tweedle-R. 



TWEEDLE-R. AND TWEE-C.-B. 51 

** Thank you very much," added Twee-C.-B. 
'* You like poetry ? " 

** Ye — es," said John, " I like some kinds of 
poetry. But can you tell me which is my way 
out of the wood ? " 

** What shall I recite to him?'* said Twee- 
C.-B., looking round to Tweedle-R., who stood 
there with great solemn eyes, neither paying 
any heed to John s questions. 

**' The Chaplin and the Missioner' is the 
longest/' Tweedle-R. replied. 

Twee-C.-B. began instantly — 
The sun was shining 

Here John made a last desperate attempt. 
** If it's more than four verses," he said, 
" would you tell me first which road " 

Twee-C.-B. only smiled and began again — 

The sun was dumping on the sea, 

Dumping with all his might. 
He did his best to rule the waves. 

And rule them nice and bright ; 
And this was odd, because it was 

The middle of the night. 

The moon was shining sulkily. 

Because she thought the sun 
Had really got no right to dump 

After the day was done. 



52 



JOHN BULL^S ADVENIX^KES 



" Its not kgitimate" she said^ 
" To come and spoil my fun," 

The C, was cute as cute could be^ 

The speeches dry as dry; 
You could not see the reason^ since 

There was no reason why : 
No facts were flying overhead — 

There were no facts to fly. 

The Chaplin and the Missioner 
Were walking glove in hand ; 

They wept like anything to see 
Such quantities of sand : 

" If this were only tilled with wheat" 
They said, " // WOULD be grand I " 




THE CHAPLIN AND THE MISSIONER 



TWEEDLE-R. AND TWEE-C.-B. 68 

" If Seddon with a seven-bob tax 

Worked it for half a year^ 
Do you suppose,'* the Chaplin said, 

" That he could make bread dear ? " 
" I guess sol* said the Missioner, 

And raised a British cheer. 

" O Toilers, come and walk with us ! " 

The Chaplin did beseech, 
" A simple plan, a pleasant walk, 

A trampling on the Beach: 
We cannot do with more than four 

To keep an eye on each!* 

The eldest Toiler looked at him. 

But never a word said he. 
The eldest Toiler winked his eye 

And breathed a silent D, 
Meaning to say he*d had enough 

Of such simplicity. 

But four young Toilers hurried up. 

All eager for the plan ; 
They'd paid a guinea for their hats, 

Their clothes were spick and span — 
And this was odd because, you know. 

Each was a working-man. 

Four other Toilers followed them. 

And yet another four ; 
And thick and fast they came at last. 

And more and more and more — 
So great a defnonstration 

Was never seen before. 



64 JOHN BULKS ADVENTURES 

The Chaplin and the Missioner 
Walked on a mile or so. 

And then they settled on a scheme 
Conveniently low: 

And all the little Toilers stood 
A nd listened in a row. 




**THE TIME HAS COME,' THE CHAPLIN SAID" 

" The time has come" the Chaplin said^ 

" To talk of many things, 
Of watches — wire — and Waltham clocks^ 

Of pearlies — dolls — and rings. 
And why you take it lying down^ 

And whether trusts have wings P 



TWEEDLER. AND TWEE-C.-B. 56 

" But wait a bit I' the Toilers cried, 

" Before we have our chat, 
For listening is uncommon dry, 

And all of us are fat'' 
" No hurry I' said the Missioner ; 

They thanked him much for that, 

** A tax on bread,'' the Chaplin said — 

" Two shillings, shall we say ? 
Mutton and beef and eggs and cheese 

Contribute in their way. 
Now if you're ready. Toilers dear. 

You can begin to pay',' 

" The foreigner, not US ! " they cried. 

Turning a little blue ; 
'^ After your pledge, to pay would be 

A dismal thing to do',' 
" The Empire s fine',' the Chaplin said, 

" Do you admire the view ? 

" // was so kind of you to come, 

You looked so green and nice," 
The Missioner said nothing but, 

" They're deaf to your advice; 
I wish you would not perorate — 

Pve had to stop you twice" 

** // seems a shame',' the Chaplin said, 

" To play them such a trick. 
After we've led them on so far 

And talked to them so quicks 
The Missioner said nothing but, 

" W^ve piled it on too thick" 



56 



JOHN BULKS ADVENTURES 



" / beg of youl^ the Chaplin saidy 
" Don't act contrariwise!' 

With hums and hahs he blurted out 
Words of the largest size^ 

Showing his pocket-handkerchief 
Before their wondering eyes. 




'THEYD BOLTED, EVERY ONE' 



" O Toilers^' said the Missioner^ 
" You've had a pleasant run ! 

Won't you be giving me your votes ? '* 
But answer came there none — 

And this was scarcely odd, because 
They'd bolted, every one I 



TWEEDLER. AND TWEE-C.-B. 57 

** I like the Chaplin best," said John, ** be- 
cause, you see, he was a little sorry for the 
trick they played on the poor Toilers." 

** It was his idea in the first place, though," 
said Twee-C.-B. *' Hell be waiting for years 
and years and years for someone daring enough 
to play the trick." 

" How shameful ! " John said indignantly. 
**Then I like the Missioner best — if he was 
only persuaded into it by the Chaplin." 

*'But he wasnt," said Tweedle-R. ** He 
wasn't the sort of person to be persuaded into 
anything he didn't want to do." 

This seemed to make it a case of dishonours 
easy. After a little, John began, ** Well, they 
were both very unpleasant characters " 

He had got thus far when all of a sudden 
Tweedle-R. and Twee-C.-B. took hold of each 
other's hands and took to their heels. John 
was puzzled at this, till he looked up, and there 
in the tree was the Cat once more. 

Johns first impulse was to run away too, 
but on second thoughts it seemed silly to be 
so frightened, so he thought he would speak 
to it. 



58 JOHN BULKS ADVENTURES 

** Saucy Puss " — he began timidly, as he did 
not know whether it was this breed of Cat ; 
however, it only grinned, and did not seem 
offended — ** would you tell me, please, where I 
ought to go from here ? " 

** It all depends," said the Cat, **on whether 
you're a Tariff Reformer." 

" I think," said John, though he didn't see 
what the Cat was driving at, "that Tm a Free 
Trader." 

** Then it would take Mr. Seddon to say 
where youVe sure to go," said the Cat. 

John felt it would be dangerous to ask to 
have this explained, so he began on another 
tack. '* What sort of people live about here?" 

** In that direction," the Cat said, waving its 
right paw round, '* lives a Hatter, and in that 
direction," waving the other, "lives a March 
Hare. Visit either you like, theyVe sure to be 
found together, and theyVe both mad." 

'' But Td rather not visit either if theyVe 
both mad," said John. 

*'Oh, you can t help that here!" said the Cat; 
'*its a mad world, you know — Shakespeare 
said so, you know, and he lived in my county. 



TWEEDLE-R. AND TWEE-C.-B. 69 

Tm mad — Ritchie made me mad. You re 
mad ! " 

**What makes you think I'm mad?" said 
John. 

** You must be mad/' said the Cat, "or you 
wouldn't continue to go about unprotected." 

John knew there was some meaning in this, 
but he didn't know what it was, so saying 
**Good day, Puss," very politely, he walked off 
in the direction where the March Hare was 
said to live. In a very little while he came 
to what looked like a palace with a large 
tower with a clock in it. Policemen touched 
their hats to him, the traffic stopped to let him 
get across the street. John felt sure that this 
must be the March Hare's house, but he was 
very disturbed at the thought that it might be 
mad. ** Perhaps after all I ought to have gone 
to the Hatter's, though, to be sure, the Cat said 
I should find them both together." 



CHAPTER VII 

THE MAD TEA-PARTY 

nr^HERE was a table set out on a terrace 
-■- in front of the House, and the March 
Hare and the Mad Hatter were having tea at 
it ; a Dormouse was sitting between them fast 
asleep, quite unmindful of the conversation of 
the other two. 

** How horrid for the Dormouse!*' thought 
John Bull to himself; **only, as it seems to be 
asleep, I suppose it doesn't understand what the 
other two are saying." 

The table was an enormous one, but the 
three were all at one corner of it. ** No trade ! 
No trade ! '' cried the Hatter inconsequently 
when he saw John coming. ** There's plenty 
of trade," said John indignantly, although he 
thought it all a curious kind of welcome and 
he sat down in a comfortable armchair at one 
end of the table. 

60 



THE MAD TEA-PARTY 



61 



** Have some jam?** said the March Hare, 
looking for approval to the Hatter. 

John looked all round the table to see how 
many sorts of jam there were, but couldn't see 




TEA ON THE TERRACE 



any of any sort. ** I don't see any jam," he 
said. 

** There isn't any," said the March Hare. 

** They're all making sugar ! " shouted the 
Mad Hatter. 

** Then it wasn't very polite of you to offer 
jam," said John, mightily offended. 



62 JOHN BULKS ADVENTURES 

" Oh ! you needn't look for manners here," 
said the Dormouse, suddenly waking up, only 
to relapse at once into sleep. 

**If you come to that,'* said the March 
Hare, ** I should like to know who asked you 
to take the armchair?" 

** I beg your pardon," said John, ** but I 
thought it was meant for me." 

"You're practically stagnant," said the Hatter. 
He had been studying John for some time, and 
said this with an air of great deliberation. 

** You'd get on a good deal better," said 
John, **if you weren't so personal. But there, 
I suppose you can't help it." 

The Hatter put up his eyeglass and made as 
though he would hit back ; but all he did was 
to say, ** Why is a pearl button like an Old Age 
Pension } " 

** Come, we shall have some sport now," 
thought John. **They told me that he was 
always asking conundrums, and they're quite 
right. I believe I could guess that," he added 
aloud. 

*' Do you mean that that isn't unanswer- 
able ? " said the March Hare. 



THE MAD TEA-PARTY 63 

*' Well, if you must put it in that round- 
about way, yes." 

**Then you should say what you mean," the 
March Hare said, with all the air and mien of a 
leader. 

** I always do," said John, feeling, however, 
considerably flustered. *' At all events, I mean 
what I say — which is pretty much the same 
thing." 

** Not a bit the same thing," said the Hatter. 
*' You might as well say that * I hit what I see ' 
is the same as * I see what I hit.' " 

** You might just as well say," added the 
March Hare, **that *I think what I like' is 
the same thing as ' I like what I think.' " 

**You might just as well say," added the 
Dormouse, talking in his sleep, '* that ' I know 
when I resign ' is the same as * I resign when 
I know.'" 

Here both the March Hare and the Hatter 
sat on the Dormouse, and the party sat silent 
for a little, whilst John thought over all he could 
remember about pearl buttons (which was not 
much) and Old Age Pensions (which was a 
good deal). 



64 JOHN BULKS ADVENTURES 

The Hatter was the first to speak. " What 
year is it?" he said, turning to John ; he had 
taken his watch out of his pocket and was 
looking at it very thoughtfully, as if he were 
trying to find out where it was made. 

John considered a little, and then said, *' Well> 
not 1872." 

" I told you cooking wouldn't suit the statis- 
tics," said the March Hare. 

'* I did the cooking myself," said the Hatter. 

**Yes, but too many cooks spoil the argu- 
ment," said the March Hare. ** I always say 
right off what comes in my head first." 

The Hatter kept on gloomily looking at the 
watch ; then he pulled out the mainspring to 
see if it would tell the year any better ; but all 
he did was to murmur sadly, '* The sea voyage 
across the Atlantic didn't suit it ; it ought to 
have been made at Prescot." 

John had been looking at the watch with 
some curiosity. '*What an odd sort of a 
watch ! " he said ; *' all the years are marked 
on it, but the hands always point to 1872." 

**Why shouldn't they?" said the Hatter 
rather crossly. ** Doesnt your watch ever point 
to that year ? " 



THE MAD TEA-PARTY 65 

** Of course it did," John replied very readily ; 
*' but it doesn't point to that year for such a 
long time together." 

** Well, mine does," said the Hatter. 

** Though any other year would do," the 
■March Hare reminded the Hatter. 

** Exactly what I said myself," he said. 

John felt dreadfully puzzled. They seemed 
to be talking in quotations, though he didn't 
know where from. ** I don't quite understand," 
he said as politely as he could. 

** The Dormouse is asleep again," said the 
Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea upon its 
nose. 

The Dormouse yawned impatiently, and said 
without opening its eyes, ** Of course, of 
course ; I told him he needn't post the letter 
unless he wanted to." 

*' Have you guessed the riddle yet ? " the 
Hatter said, turning to John again. 

** No ; I give it up," John replied. '' What's 
the answer ? " 

** That's exactly what I want to find out 
myself," said the Hatter. 

** I was convinced I knew once," said the 

F 



66 JOHN BULL'S ADVENTURES 

March Hare, **but now my convictions are so 
unsettled that I haven't the slightest idea." 

** Don't you know any easy riddles that have 
got answers?'* said John a little plaintively. 

*' I know one," said the Hatter. '' Why am 
I called a Whole Hogger ? *' 

John smiled ; it did seem such an easy one. 

** Because," he said very hopefully, **you 
want to go it, I suppose." 

*' I knew he'd say that," said the March 
Hare triumphantly. 

** Isn't it right ? " said John gloomily. 

*'Of course not," said the Hatter. **The 
real answer is, ' Because I won't tax bacon.' " 

** I know an easy riddle, too," said the March 
Hare. ** What is a Little Englander ? " 

** That's a question, not a riddle," said John, 
who was getting tired of being trifled with. 

'* Well, anyhow, you don't know the answer," 
said the March Hare. 

*' What is it ? ' said John. 

** Why, a person who thinks too much of 
England, of course," said the Hatter. 

** You might let me answer my own riddles 
myself," said the March Hare rather peevishly. 



THE MAD TEA-PARTY 67 

John sighed deep and long. ** I think you 
might spend the time of the House better/' 
he said, '* than in wasting it on foolish 
riddles." 

'* That s because you don't know Time," said 
the Hatter. ** If you only know Time and 
keep on good terms with him you can do almost 
what you like with him. For instance, two or 
three years ago we just whispered to him the 
War was over, and in a twinkling it was time 
for a General Election ! " 

**That must be very convenient," said John, 
looking for once as if he knew all about what 
was being told him. 

**We quarrelled last March," said the 
Hatter, **just before Ritchie made me and him 
mad, you know" (pointing with a long tea- 
spoon to the March Hare). ** It was at a 
great Pow-Wow in Downing Street, and I 
had to sing — 

Dwindle y dwindle, British trade I 
By the foreigner betrayed! 

You know the song, perhaps } " 

'* I know something like it," said John. 



68 JOHN BULUS ADVENTURES 

** It goes on, you know/* the Hatter con- 
tinued, in this way — 

Witk the tariff walls so high 
Down to zero point you fly. 
Dwindle^ dwindle 




^^ 



THE HATTER SINGS 



Here the Dormouse began to murmur, 
''Dwindle, dwindle, dwindle,'' and wouldn't 
stop till the March Hare gave it a sharp rap 
with a letter. 

**Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,*' 



THE MAD TEA-PARTY 69 

said the Hatter, '*when the whistle went and 
they all shouted * Time ! Time ! * " 

'* He must have been cross," said John. 

**And ever since then," the Hatter said 
mournfully, **he won't do a thing I ask. Its 
always 1872 now.'* 

The Hatter looked so worried that John 
thought it prudent to change the subject. 
'* Why are so many tea-things put out here ?" 
he asked. 

"Well, you see," said the March Hare, 
** there used to be such a lot more to have 
tea." 

** But the cups look as if they were used," 
said John. 

**So they are," said the March Hare ; ''but 
it s always tea-time because it's always after- 
noon, and there's too much dirty linen to wash 
to worry over cups.'" 

** Then you keep moving round, I suppose,' 
said John. 

*' Suppose we change the subject," said the 
March Hare, who was getting very bored. *' I 
vote the gentleman tells us a story." 

'' So do I," said the Hatter. ** I'd tell one 



70 JOHN BULKS ADVENTURES 

myself if I could. But I can't, try how I 
will." 

*' Well, I am surprised," said John, plucking 
up courage to say so much. 

'' Don't be personal," said the Hatter. 
** We're waiting for your story." 

** Please," said John, who was afraid he had 
offended the Hatter, '* I don t know one." 

" Then the Dormouse shall ! " they both 
cried. '' Wake up, my Harty," they cried, 
using its pet name and squeezing it on both 
sides at once. 

The Dormouse slowly opened its eyes. '' I 
wasn't asleep at all," he said. '' I heard every 
word you fellows said." 

'' Tell us a story," said the March Hare. 

**And be quick about it," said the Hatter, 
'* or I shall have to hurry off to my Committee 
before you've done." 

''Once upon a time there were three little 
brothers," the Dormouse began in a great 
hurry, '*and their names were Ritchie, Georgie, 
and Burlie ; and they lived at the bottom of a 
well " 



THE MAD TEA-PARTY 71 

'* What did they live on?" said John, who 
always liked hearing about good living. 

**They lived on freefood," said the Dor- 
mouse, after pondering for a few seconds. 

**They couldn't have done that, you know,'* 
said the Hatter ; *' it would have made them 
sick." 

** That's just what they were," said the Dor- 
mouse, ** very sick." 

John could make nothing at all out of it, but 
he said, *' Why did they live at the bottom of 
a well?" 

** Take some more tea," said the March 
Hare, with an air of intense settled conviction. 

*Mt s the best Indian," said the Hatter 
proudly. 

"Why, I didn't know you knew so much 
geography," said John. 

''Who's arguing like a lawyer now? "said 
the Hatter triumphantly. 

John did wish that they would not talk in 
inverted commas ; so he helped himself to 
some tea and bread and butter — every slice of 
which had *' Grown in Canada" stamped on it 
in red — and then turned to the Dormouse and 



72 JOHN BULKS ADVENTURES 

repeated his question. '' Why did they live at 
the bottom of a well ? " 

The Dormouse yawned two or three times 
and then said, *' Because Truth lived there." 

** There's no such thing," the Hatter 
shrieked, but the March Hare went '*Sh! Sh!" 
and the Dormouse sulkily remarked, *Mf you 
can't be civil I shall go to sleep again ; I could 
easily." 

*' No, please go on," said John. So the 
Dormouse continued, ** And so these three 
little brothers — they were learning to draw, 
you know " 

*' What did they draw ? " said John eagerly. 

*' Salaries," said the Hatter before the Dor- 
mouse had time to answer. 

The Dormouse was so angry at being in- 
terrupted that he began to go to sleep, but 
before even he had time to get off the Hatter 
said, *' I want a clean cup ; let s move one 
place on." 

They all moved on one place, but the Hatter 
was the only one who reaped any advantage 
from the change ; and John was a good deal 
worse off, as the March Hare had covered 



THE MAD TEA-PARTY 73 

the tablecloth with illegible notes and horrible 
drawings of imaginary islands. 

*'They were learning to draw," the Dor- 
mouse suddenly resumed, though in a very 
sleepy voice; **and they drew all manner of 
things — everything that ended in ION " 

'* Why with ION ? " said John. 

**Why not?'' said the March Hare, who 
loved these rhetorical questions as much as 
John disliked them. 

By this time the Dormouse was nearly 
asleep ; but on being squeezed by the Hatter 

it woke up again and went on, *' that ends 

in ION, such as addition, and subtraction, and 
bullion, and superstition, and opposition, and 
resignation — did you ever see a drawing of a 
resignation ? '* 

** I got the a/^/^drawing of a resignation 
once/' said the March Hare, looking at the 
Hatter. 

This piece of rudeness to the Dormouse 
was more than John could bear ; he got up 
in great disgust and walked off; the Dormouse 
fell asleep, and the last time he saw his hosts 
the March Hare and the Hatter were trying 



74 



JOHN BULKS ADVENTURES 



to cram the Dormouse up into the Protection 
teapot. 

** At any rate, Til never go there again," 
said John, as he picked his way through 
Parliament Street. '* It's the maddest tea- 
party I was ever at in my life." 




THR DORMOUSE AND THE TEAPOT 



CHAPTER VIII 
"ITS MY OWN INVENTION'^ 

JOHN walked and walked through the streets 
till he came to roads and at last into real 
country. After a while he came to a field with 
a large gate upon which was written ** Shef 
Field," whilst near by was a notice saying 
**To the Caucus Race." He went along a 
little path till he came to a clump of trees, and 
as it was a hot day he sat down for a while 
and wondered if he should ever get back to 
his own country — for, as his friends told him, 
he was a great Little Englander. 

At this moment his thoughts were suddenly 
interrupted by a loud shouting of *' Ahoy ! 
Ahoy! Check!*' and a Knight, dressed in 
crimson armour, came swooping down upon 
him, brandishing a Free Food League. (John 
had by this time discovered that Clubs were 
sometimes called Leagues when they had any- 

75 



76 JOHN BULKS ADVENTURES 

thing to do with Sections.) Just as he reached 
him the horse stopped suddenly. ** I've got 
you," the Knight cried, as he tumbled off his 
horse. 

John wondered at this strange move, because 
when he saw **GORST" embroidered on the 
trappings he recognised the Knight as an 
ex- School Attendance Officer. Whilst he was 
wondering if it all meant he had to go to school 
in the Fiscal Wonderland, the Red Knight 
had picked himself up and got into the saddle 

again. ** Tve got " he began again, but 

here another voice broke in, " Yah-yah ! Yah- 
yah ! " and John looked round to see who the 
new enemy might be. 

This time it was the White Knight, whom 
John recognised as having met before on the 
parade ground when he was driven off the 
field by the mutinous loaves. He came up 
to Johns side, exactly as the Red Knight 
had done, and tumbled off too, exactly in the 
same way. Then he got on his horse again, 
and the two Knights sat and glared at each 
other without speaking, John growing more 
and more bewildered all the time as to what 



"ITS MY OWN INVENTION" 77 

they wanted him for and what they would do 
to him when they had got him. 

** He's mine — you know/' the Red Knight 
said at last. 

** He was until / came and rescued him ! " 
the White Knight replied. 

**Well, we must fight for him, then," said 
the Red Knight, as he took up his helmet 
(which hung from his saddle and looked to be 
a very odd kind) and put it on. 

** You will observe the Rules of Arithmetic, 
of course ? " the Red Knight added, as he put 
on his helmet. 

'' It all depends," said the White Knight ; 
and they began banging away at each other 
with so much noise that John got behind a 
tree so as to escape all chance of getting hit. 

" These Rules seem to be very odd," said 
John to himself, as he looked on at the fight ; 
'*one Rule seems to be that if one Knight 
makes a motion the other makes an exactly 
contrary one : if one becomes motionless, the 
other does so too. And when either makes 
a good point, his horse stamps the ground as 
if he were cheering at a political meeting." 



78 



JOHN BULL'S ADVENTURES 



After a prodigious amount of noisy buffeting 
about they both became motionless, embraced 
each other, and then the Red Knight galloped 
off 




THK RED AND WHITE KNIGHTS FIGHT 

" It was a glorious victory, wasn't it?" said 
the White Knight, as he got off his horse and 
came up breathing heavily. 

'' I don't know," said John doubtfully. '' I 
don't want to be had by anybody. I want to 
be myself." 



"IT'S MY OWN INVENTION" 79 

"So you will;* said the White Knight, '*if 
you come on for a bit with me. This field is 
where I come from, and I can show you all the 
paths about here." 

** Thank you very much," said John. 
** Wouldn't you be more comfortable with your 
helmet off .'^*' It was a great struggle to get it 
off, but John managed it at last. 

** Now one can breathe more easily," said 
the Knight. John was much relieved at this, 
because he had been rather frightened at the 
White Knights voice, which seemed to go 
right through him. 

John Bull thought he had never seen such a 
weird-looking soldier since the Yeomanry left 
for South Africa. He was dressed in tinplate 
armour, and he had a queer little sieve fastened 
across his shoulders upside down. John looked 
at it with great curiosity. 

** Oh, youVe admiring my little sieve," said, 
or rather shouted the Knight, for he always 
spoke in high tones. ** It's my own invention 
— to keep prison-made goods out. You see, I 
carry it upside down, so that the foreigner 
can't get in." 



80 elOHN BULKS ADVENTURES 

'* But the things can get through,'' John 
gently remarked. ** Do you know it's full of 
little brushes ? " 

" I didn't know it," said the Knight, looking 
very crestfallen. ** Then all these brushes 
must have got through ! and the sieve is no 
good if they do that." He unfastened it as he 
spoke, and was just going to throw it into the 
ditch when a happy thought seemed to strike 
him, and he hung it with great care on to a tree. 
*' I wonder if you can guess why I do that?" 
he said to John, who had not, however, an 
idea. 

** In hopes that someone may take a brush — 
then I should show them up in the papers." 

**Are these the papers you mean.'^" said 
John, pointing to the horse's shoulder, where 
there was a bundle of sheets with curious little 
red marks all over them. 

** No, those are maps," said the Knight, 
**with all the Kings dominions marked in 
red." 

*' I was wondering what the red meant," 
said John. ** It isn't very likely, though, you d 
want a map if youVe only out for a ride." 



"ITS MY OWN INVENTION" 81 

'*Not very likely," said the Knight, '*but if 
the worst comes, I shouldn^t like to find myself 
in a foreign country." 

**You see," he said, after a pause, **it's as 
well to be provided for everything; that's the 
reason the horse has anklets round his feet." 

*' But what are they for ? " John asked. 

**To guard against dumps," the Knight 
replied. ** It s an invention of my own." 

**And what's in that bag?" said John, point- 
ing to what looked like a very heavy bag slung 
on to the saddle. 

** That's full of 'arf-a-bricks," said the Knight. 

" What are they for ? " said John. 

** Why, to heave at the foreigners, of course," 
said the Knight, much surprised at John's not 
knowing such a simple thing as that. ** Come," 
he added, ** I'll go with you to the end of the 
field." 

And so they set off together, the Knight on 
his horse with John walking rather apprehen- 
sively at his side. 

** I hope you know how to keep your hair 
on," said the Knight, as they went on their 
way. 



8J^ JOHN BUIJ;s ADVENTURES 

** Oh, nothing more than usual," said John, 
amused at the Knight's anxiety. 

** That's hardly enough,'' he said; **the 
wind's so very strong here — there are always 
so many people trying to raise it, you know." 

** Have you invented any plan for keeping 
one's hair on ? " John inquired. 

*'Not at present," said the Knight. "But 
I've got a plan for making it stand up on end." 

**That sounds very interesting," said John. 
** I should like to hear about that." 

**You take a leaflet, one of my own in- 
vention," said the Knight, **and read how 
many millions' worth of manufactured goods 
come in from abroad each year. Then you 
multiply by 20 to turn it into shillings, next 
you divide by 52 to reduce it to weeks, and 
then you divide again by 30 to reduce it to 
workmen. Then you think of all the work- 
men who haven t got the work, and of all the 
foreigners who have, and your hair is standing 
up as straight as the Queen's Westminsters. 
You can try it if you like. It's my own 
invention." 

*' Dear me," said John, "I had heard of 




THE WHITE KNIGHT OF SHEFFIELD 



84 JOHN BULKS ADVENTURES 

that, but I thought it was Mr. Chamberlain's 
idea." 

** He got it from me," said the White Knigh 
in a whisper (it wasn't much of a whisper, but 
it was the best he could do). ** He gets most 
of his best ideas from me." 

Whosesoever idea it was, John did not think 
much of it, and for a few minutes they went | 

on in silence, John every now and again i 

stopping to help the poor Knight, who cer- j 

tainly was not a good rider. 

Whenever the horse stopped (which it did ( 

very often) he fell off in front; and whenever j 

it went on (which it always did very un- 
expectedly) he fell off behind. Sometimes he 
fell off sideways, generally on the side on which 
John was walking, so that John kept a good 
distance, though he never got out of earshot. . 

'' I'm afraid you've not had much practice in 
riding,'* said John, anxious to make the best 
excuse for this on-and-off sort of performance, 

The Knight looked sadly at John and said, 
" That's just it. Unmounted men preferred, 
you know, and they wouldn't let me go to the 
front." 



"ITS MY OWN INVENTION^ 85 

John thought that if the Knight had gone he 
would have been unmounted, but what he said 
was, ** It was very good of you to want to go." 

*' Oh, I wanted to go right enough," said the 
Knight. '4 volunteered all over the place, but 
all they could be got to say was * Thank you.'" 

*' Tm sorry you were so disappointed," said 
John. 

There was a short silence after this ; then 
the Knight began again. *' I'm a great hand at 
inventing things. Here's a thing I invented." 

As he spoke he pointed to a Big Revolver. 

** I invented that,'' he said, speaking as 
though he were telling a great secret, ** to 
frighten alien immigrants from landing." 

*M thought," said John Bull, **that the Big 
Revolver was Lord Lansdowne's idea, and that 
he wanted it to frighten Ambassadors with." 

** He borrowed the idea from me," said the 
Knight ; ** they all get their best ideas from 
me," he went on, with pardonable pride. 

** What's that ? " said John, pointing to a 
weird-looking contrivance, upon the handle 
of which the Knight's hand rested. 

** It's my own invention," said the Knight. 



86 JOHN BULKS ADVENTURES 

When John looked at it it turned out to be an 
immense rubber stamp. It had an enormous 
handle, whilst on the end was this curious- 
looking lettering — 



\\AAISAfl30 l/ll aCAMl 



** Whenever," said the Knight, ** I see any- 
thing not made in this country — apples and 
oysters and plums, in fact anything — I always 
stamp it with this." 

"You must be kept very busy," said John ; 
** but perhaps when once they find out where 
the things come from, they never get any 
more." 

A sad look came into the Knight s eyes. 

** That's exactly what I had hoped would 
happen when I first invented it. But the 
disappointing thing is that they only sent 
for more, because, you see, when they saw 
*MADE IN Germany/ they knew where to send 
for them." 

** Is that how it reads .'*" said John, who 
wondere4 what the words really were. 



"ITS MY OWN INVENTION" 



87 



Here a splendid idea struck the Knight. 
He would stamp the top of John's hat just to 
show him how the stamp worked. He grasped 
the handle in some excitement, and instantly 




THE WHITE KNIGHT IN THE DITCH 

rolled out of the saddle and fell headlong into 
a deep ditch. 

John ran to the side of the ditch, much 
frightened. He could see nothing of the 
Knight except the soles of his feet, but he was 
much relieved to hear him saying, " Yah-yah ! 



88 JOHN BULKS ADVENTURES 

Yah-yah ! " in quite his usual tone. ** I want 
to get it altered to *made abroad/ so that 
they wouldn't know where to send," he said, 
** but theyVe always too busy to get the words 
changed." 

" How can you go on talking so loudly, head 
downwards.'^" said John, as he pulled him out 
by the feet and landed him on the bank. 

The Knight looked surprised at this ques- 
tion. ** What difference does it make where 
my body is ? " he said. ** My mind goes on 
working just the same. In fact, when Tm 
head downwards I invent more than ever. 

** Now the cleverest thing I ever did," he 
said, when he had recovered his breath a little, 
** was inventing a new Tariff during the dinner- 
hour." 

** In time to have it working by the next day.'*" 
said John. ** Well, that was quick work indeed." 

*' Well, not the next day," said the Knight, 
considering ; ** no, certainly not the next day'' 

** Then I suppose it must have been the next 
month ? " 

** Well, not the next month," the Knight re- 
peated as before, '*not the next month. In 



«rrS MY OWN INVENTION'^ 89 

fact," he went on whispering with all his might, 
'* I don't believe that Tariff ever was working. 
In fact, I don t believe that Tariff ever will be 
working ! And yet it was a very clever Tariff 
to invent." 

"What did you mean it to be made of?" 
John said, thinking it might cheer him up to 
talk about it. 

'* It began with ten per cent.," answered the 
Knight, with a groan. 

** That wasn't very high, Tm afraid " 

**Not very high at first," he interrupted, 
**but you've no idea how soon it would have 
got higher. And here I must leave you." 

John could only look dazed; he was thinking 
of all the inventions — the sieve, the maps, the 
anklets, the 'arf-a-bricks, the revolver, the 
rubber stamp, the Tariff. 

** You are sad," said the Knight in an anxious 
tone ; "let me sing you a song to comfort you." 

*' Is it very long?" John said, who was begin- 
ning to get shy of recited poems. 

**It is long," said the Knight, '*but it's very 
beautiful. The name of the song is called Old 
Age Pensions^ 



90 JOHN BULLS ADVENTURES 

"Oh, that's the name of the song, is it?" 
John said, feeling his way. 

** No, you don't understand," the Knight 
said. ** That's what the name is called. The 
name really is * The Agedy Aged Man^ 

"Well, what is the song?" said John, com- 
pletely bewildered. 

"The song," said the Knight, "really is 
'A'Sitting on a Fence,' and the tune s my own 
invention." 

So saying, he stopped his horse, and, having 
shouted " 'Tention ! " began beating time with 
one hand, and with a fond smile lighting up his 
curious features. 

"After all, the tune isnt his own invention," 
John said to himself; "its ' I give thee all, 
I can no more' " He stood and listened very 
attentively.

His accents mild took up the tale; 

He said, " / go my ways.

To frame a method plain, 
To keep the L,C,C, from buying

And searched the country high and low. 
Precisely where he ought to go 
To find the Old Age Pension show — 
That summer evening long ago, 
A -sitting on the fence. 

As the Knight sang the last words of the 
hymn he turned his horse's head along the 
road by which they had come. ** YouVe only 
a few yards to go," he said. *' But you 11 see 
me off first?" he added. ** It won't take me 
long. You'll wave your handkerchief to me 
when I get to that turn of the road? It will 
make me feel less lonely." 

*' Of course I will," said John; **and thank 
you very much for your company — and for the 
song. I liked it very much." 

** I hope you did," said the Knight, **but 
I'm dreadfully afraid you won't remember it." 

John was perfectly sure he wouldn't, but he 
thought it unnecessary to sadden the Knight by 
saying he wouldn't, so they shook hands, and 
then the Knight rode away back along the 
path to the Shef Field gate. As it proved, 
he was quite right ; it did not take long to see 
him off. *' There he goes," said John, ** right 



"ITS MY OWN INVENllON^' 95 

off his head, as usual!" He went on talking 
to himself till the White Knight was com- 
pletely out of sight ; then he turned to go on his 
way to find to his great surprise the funniest 
little old gentleman sitting on what looked like 
an enormous mushroom. 



CHAPTER IX 
A CHANCLERPILLAR GIVES ADVICE 

^ I ^HE Chanclerpillar and John Bull looked 
^ at each other for some time without a 
word passing ; at last the Chanclerpillar took 
the cigar out of its mouth and asked him very 
deliberately, ** How 3.reyouf 

This seemed rather like a cross-examination. 
John replied rather shyly, '' I — hardly know, 
sir, just at present — at least, I know how I feel 
myself, but everybody I meet has a different 
opinion as to how I feel." 

'* That won*t do, you know," said the 
Chanclerpillar in the judgiest of intonations. 
'' Explain yourself." 

*' I can't explain myself, I'm afraid, sir," said 
John, ''because if I believe what I'm told I'm 
beside myself, you see." 

'' I don't see at all," said the Chanclerpillar, 
96 



A CHANCLERPILLAR GIVES ADVICE 97 

"and unless you stick to the point I shall 
move that you be no longer heard." 




THE CHANCLERPILLAR AND JOHN 

** I wish I could put it more clearly," John 
said ; " but I m quite as much at sea as you 
are, for when everybody knows how you feel 
better than you yourself it's dreadfully be- 
wildering." 

H 



98 JOHN BULL'S ADVENTURES 

** It isn't," snapped out the Chanclerpillar, 
who seemed ready to deny any proposition. 

"Well, perhaps you don't find it so now," 
said John ; " but when you Ve got off that 
comfortable seat — you will some day, you 
know " 

" I shan't," said the Chanclerpillar. ** I 
always feel just as well and young as ever." 

**Well, perhaps," suggested John, ** they're 
afraid to tell you how you ought to feel." 

"Not a bit," said the Chanclerpillar; "but 
whatever they say, I just go on sitting here, 
making myself comfortable." 

"Well, perhaps you haven't got any feel- 
ings," said John ; "but all I know is it all has 
a very different effect upon me'' 

"You!" almost snorted the Chanclerpillar. 
"Whoarej)/^/^?" 

This seemed like getting back to just where 
they started. John did not like this style of 
cross-examining question, so, drawing himself 
to his full height, he said, with rather an 
injured air, " I think it's your turn now to 
answer a question. Who are you ? " 

The Chanclerpillar seemed on the point of 



A CHANCLERPILLAR GIVES ADVICE 99 

answering with a question, but what it did 
say was, ** I am what I have been.'* 

John thought this so unfriendly that he 
turned away to go. 

**Come back,*' shouted the Chanclerpillar, 
** I'm ready to give judgment." 

** Yes, m'lud,** said John, affected by the 
very legal state of the atmosphere. 

** Tm a person of rank," said the Chancler- 
pillar. 

*' What rank ? " said John, agreeably sur- 
prised at this communicativeness. 

**Rank Protectionism," said the Chancler- 
pillar, with a little chuckle. 

This was much more amusing, and John 
thought after all he might pick up something 
worth knowing. For some minutes the Chan- 
clerpillar dozed on its comfortable perch, but 
at last it stretched its arms and said, ** So you 
think you're changed, do you ? " 

**Well, I'm afraid I must be," said John, 
** because what so many people say must be 
true. I don't seem to be able to remember 
things, for all the history I learnt at school 



100 JOHN BULL'S ADVENl'URES 

seems to be wrong, and I don't seem to be the 
same size for ten minutes together ! " 

'*Cant remember what things?" said the 
Chanclerpillar. 

**Well, whenever I try to say, 'How cloth 
the little busy bee,' it is always 'How doth our 
pushful Joey C,' "John replied mournfully. 

** Try * You are old. Father William' " said 
the Chanclerpillar. 

So John began — 



A CHANCLERPILLAR GIVES ADVICE 101 




FATHER JOSEPH STANDS ON HIS HEAD 

" You are old. Father Joseph]^ the young man satdy 

" Though your head doesn't show any white. 
And yet you incessantly stand on your head. 
Do you think at your age it is right ? " 



"/« my youthl' Father Joseph replied to his son, 

"/ thought it might give me a pain,

'*/ suppose it must just be a family trait',' 
Said his father, " so give yourself airs. 

And maybe — who knows ? — on some future fine day. 
As a peer they may kick you upstairs ^ 



A CHANCLERPILLAR GIVES ADVICE 105 

" That is not said right," said the Chancier- 
pillar. 

** Of course it isn't," said John. ** I told you 
I couldn't remember things." 

** You are dead wrong from beginning to 
end," said the Chanclerpillar, as it settled itself 
for a short snooze. 

It woke up as usual with a question. 

** What size would you like to be ? " it asked. 

" Well, I should like to be a little larger, sir, 
if you wouldn't mind," said John, **than Mr. 
Chamberlain makes me. Six inches is such a 
wretched height to be." 

" It s a splendid height," said the Chancler- 
pillar angrily, for six inches was a good deal 
more than its own height. 

** But Tm not used to being so small," 
pleaded John. ** You see, it's such a sudden 
change, for all these years they've never left 
off telling me what a fine fellow I was." 

** Well, you'll get used to it in time," said 
the Chanclerpillar ; and it put the cigar back 
into its mouth and went on smoking again. 

Just then the March Hare came bustling up 
as if he had something important to say and 



106 JOHN BULL^S ADVENTURES 

wished to say it as quickly as possible, for fear 
that if he didn't get it over and done with he 
would never get it said at all. 

** Would you be so very kind, Mr. Chancier- 
pillar," he began briskly, but that was all he 
ever got the chance of saying, for before he 
could get any farther the Chanclerpillar, in 
the blandest possible way, broke in with — 
'' Don't worry, my dear Arthur," it said, with 
a smile. ** I wouldn't for the world add to your 
worries by making you find someone to take 
my place." 

" Thank you so much," said the March Hare 
meekly; but John, as he moved away, could 
not help thinking that he heard the March 
Hare (who looked very flushed and discomfited) 
mutter under his breath, ** Bunkered again." 
But that may only have been his fancy, for 
he had not nearly got used to all the strange 
sights and sounds he saw and heard in the 
Fiscal Wonderland. 



CHAPTER X 
THE FISCAL TOURNAMENT 

JOHN was only too glad when at last he 
got out of the field^where the two Knights 
had fought, and once out in the road he hurried 
back from the country as fast as his legs would 
carry him. 

He was very much happier when once again 
he was amongst streets and houses and shops, 
but he had not been there long before it was 
only too evident that something very much 
out of the ordinary was happening. All the 
people seemed to be hurrying one way, and 
to be wearing pictures in their buttonholes. 

** Portrait of the grite man,*' shouted a 
girl whom John remembered to have seen 
selling flowers, as she tried to pin in John's 
coat a button with a picture of the Mad Hatter 
on it. 

John had only just succeeded in warding off 
107 



108 



JOHN BULL^S ADVENTURES 



this attack when a second girl tried to make 
him buy another kind of button with what 
looked like two loaves on it. 

John would have neither, and as he wondered 
what it all meant he suddenly came upon his 
old friend the White Rabbit, this time as a 
sandwichman. There he was, with a Tin 
Soldier, parading the streets with this curious 
announcement : — 




THE BIG FIGHT SANDWICHMEN 



John was half inclined to ask the White 
Rabbit what it was all about, but he remembered 
how excited and angry he had got when they 



THE FISCAL TOURNAMENT 



109 



last met, and on second thoughts decided not 
to. 

It was very puzzling, though, not to know 
what was going on, and John was on the point 
of asking* the first policeman he met, when 
suddenly a large Bird alighted at his side. 




THE SECRETARV-BIRD 



It was the kind that John had seen drawn 
in books, called the Secretary-Bird. It wore 
a knowing look, there were lots of quill pens 
stuck over its head, it carried a large note- 
book under one wing, and its head was hinged 
on like the lid of a fancy ink-bottle. 



110 JOHN BULL^ ADVENTURES 

'* Going to the Tournament?** said the Bird. 

**Oh! its a Tournament, is it?'* said John, 
relieved that at all events he was beginning to 
find out something. 

*' Of course it is,** said the Bird. '' I thought 
everybody knew that.** 

** Well, you see,** said John, ** Tve only just 
come up from the country.'* 

** That's the worst of the provinces," said 
the Bird, "they're so slow.** 

John thought that there was such a thing as 
being too quick — for a motor rushed past them 
at the moment, going at what seemed to be 
about sixty miles an hour ; but he did not want 
to offend the Bird, and he did want to find 
out more about the Tournament, so what he 
said was, ** What sort of Tournament is it ? *' 

*' A Fiscal Tournament, of course," said the 
Bird. 

** I might have known,** groaned John, for 
when he reflected he remembered that he was 
in the Fiscal Wonderland. 

**The Mad Hatter,*' continued the Bird, 
"has issued a challenge to all the world to 
meet him in single combat.** 



THE FISCAL TOURNAMENl^ 111 

This helped John a great deal, for now he 
knew why the flower-girl had tried to make 
him buy and wear the button. He thought it 
would be rather fun to see the Hatter on a 
horse, but he was rather afraid he wouldn't be 
able to get in. 

"All the tickets are gone," he said, ** I 
suppose, by this time." 

**Of course they are," said the Bird. At 
this Johns face fell, but it added. ** Would you 
like to see it ? '* 

** Very much," said John. '* You see, I once 
had tea with the Hatter." 

**Oh! I didn't know you were a personal 
friend," said the Bird (John didn't know that 
either exactly). "In that case I think I could 
get you in." 

"Thank you very much," said John, **but 
I'm afraid I'm giving you a lot of trouble." 

" Not at all," said the Bird condescendingly. 
"I'm going to the Press Box to report the 
Tournament for my paper. There will be 
plenty of room for you — you're not very big, 
you know — and you'll be able to see and hear 
everything." 



112 JOHN BULL'S ADVENTURES 

** If youVe sure Tm not inconveniencing you," 
said John. 

Here the Bird looked at its watch and 
hurriedly said, '*But we mustn't waste time 
talking. It begins in a quarter of an hour, 
and we mustn't be late.'* 

They hurried on, and as they got near where 
the Tournament was to be held the place had 
all the appearance of a huge fair. Only those 
who had tickets could get in to the Tournament, 
but there were tens of thousands of people, 
nearly all wearing buttons, who had come out 
to cheer the various champions as they made 
their way to the place of combat. All those 
who wore Hatter buttons were made to keep 
on one side of the road, and all with loaf 
buttons on the other. On the latter side 
there were great booths labelled '' Free Trade 
Union" and ** Unionist Free Food League." 
At first John thought this meant that you 
could have a meal for nothing, but one of the 
attendants at the booth explained that this was 
not so, and all John got was a handful of leaflets. 
Across the way all the banners had the word 
** Consistent " on them. Over the booth 



THE FISCAL TOURNAMENT 113 

labelled ** Imperial Tariff Committee," for in- 
stance, a flag fluttered *' Consistent, Birming- 
ham." Another immense booth was called 
** Tariff Reform League," and here there were 
orators standing on stumps of trees, each with 
a crowd around him. 

'* I suppose we haven t time," said John, *' to 
hear what they are saying." 

** If you're very quick of hearing, we have," 
said the Bird. ** Besides," it added, **it may 
be good copy." 

This was quite unintelligible to John, but he 
didn't mind so long as he could listen to what 
was said. This is what the orator was saying — 

'Tts the Voice of the Trader: I heard him declare, 
" They have done me quite brown and its beastly unfair r 
Like a crocodile sobbing so he crieth sore 
Of the boots and the buttons he makes now no more. 
When the orders are thick he will hardly say thankee, 
And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Yankee ; 
But when the wind changes and tariffs abound, 
His voice has a timid and tremulous sound, 

" I wish everything wasn't so like and yet 
so different," said John, who felt certain that he 
knew the poem. 



114 JOHN BULL^ ADVENTURES 

**Oh! if you're going to talk," said the Bird 
— so John said no more, and the orator on the 
stump proceeded — 

I passed by his factory and marked with my eye^ 
How two Eagles were sticking their claws in his pie ; 
The German got crumbs as his share of the treaty 
While the Yankee just collared a second-hand fleet. 
When the Lion had finished the pie^ with a frown 
He settled himself for a sleep, lying dawn. 
While the Hatter, who used an enormous long spoon, 
Stirred him up 

He had got thus far when a bell sounded. 

**The saddling bell," said the Bird, and off 
he started, John hurrying after him. 

The Bird evidently represented some im- 
portant paper, for after it had whispered some- 
thing to the doorkeeper John was allowed to 
enter, though he had no ticket. In another 
minute the Bird and John were sitting in the 
front row of an enclosure labelled ** Press Box." 
At first John felt rather shy at being with so 
many birds, but that soon wore off, and he 
found himself thinking how lucky he was to 
have such a good place where he could see so 
well. 



THE FISCAL TOURNAMENT 



115 



What he saw was a large open space of turf, 
with barriers on either side. Inside the barriers 
were men and women standing, packed like 
herrings in a barrel, whilst at the back of the 
crowds were huge stands, very much like those 




TREASURY BOX 




John remembered having seen at Epsom and 
Newmarket in his own country. 

Here, too, the spectators took different sides 
according to the side they took, and there 
were lots of boxes, each having a label on 
it. On the Hatters side, for instance, the 
*' Treasury Box" contained the March Hare, 



116 JOHN BULL^S ADVENTURES 

and a little boy, the very image of the Hatter. 
John felt sure this must be the Hatters son, 
and sure enough, when later on the fighting 
began, the little fellow kept clapping his little 
hands and saying, *' Go it, father ; I do so 
admire you." 

Another box on the same side was called 
the ** Large Type Box." This was so puzzling 
that John ventured to ask the Bird for an 
explanation. 

"The people in that box," said the Bird, 
"are the people who, when they write to the 
Times, have their letters printed in large type. 
That" (and as he spoke he pointed with his 
pen) "is Mr. Benjamin Kidd.'* He named 
several others, but what interested John most 
was to see a bird in this box. 

" But who s the bird } " said John. 

"That's a great secret," said the Bird, '*but 
I don't mind telling you if you promise to 
keep the secret. That s * Tariff Reformer.' " 

On the side of those who were against the 
Hatter there were boxes labelled " Professors' 
Box " (in which sat fourteen very learned-look- 
ing gentlemen, all dressed in cap and gown, with 



THE FISCAL TOURNAMENT 117 

a fifteenth squeezed in at the back, standing) 
and ** Ex-Chancellors' Box." There were 
four people in this second box, all of great 
experience. One of them, later on, actually 
fought the Hatter, and two others made it 
very clear that they agreed with him in doing 
so. But the fourth kept trying not to be seen, 
and whenever he did catch sight of the March 
Hare he always kissed his hand to him. 

One other box interested John exceedingly. 
It was labelled the ** Bad Old Times Box," 
and was full of very old men and women, 
nearly all of them agricultural labourers in 
smock - frocks, and their womenfolk. The 
Bird explained to John that these had come 
from all parts of the country, and were those 
who remembered the time before the tax was 
taken off corn, nearly sixty years ago. 

By the time John had been able to notice all 
this another bell rang, and as soon as it finished 
clanging the White Rabbit rode into the 
centre of the arena on an exceedingly aged 
Cow. (The Bird told John that the Cow 
was such a favourite of the Rabbit's that he 
always rode it in preference to a Horse. In 



118 



JOHN^BULUS ADVENTURES 



fact, many people declared that he had ridden 
it nearly to death.) 

The Rabbit rang a large bell and shouted 
** Silence for the Great Man ! " three times. 




THE WHITE RABBIT RIDES IN 



As he ended in rode the Hatter. He was 
received with great cheering by his own side, 
many of whom (as John now noticed) wore 
mail and spoke at express rate. The Hatter 



THE FISCAL TOURNAMENT 119 

was mounted on a spirited but rather screwy 
horse, and rode slowly once round the ring, 
after which he flung down the gage (which 
turned out to be a little loaf) and rode back 
to his tent to get his armour. 

** Who dares," shouted the Rabbit (it wasn't 
much of a shout, but it could be heard by every- 
body), ** to oppose our Joe ? " 

** I do," said a Knight called Asquith, who 
rode into the ring. 

**Let the champion appear," said the Rabbit 

The Hatter, now fully clad in his armour, 
galloped in, but when he saw who his opponent 
was gave a snort of contempt. 

**Only a lawyer!'* he shouted out, and with 
that they fell to. It was quite a short en- 
counter. The Hatter kept shifting his ground, 
but once the lawyer Knight could get at him 
he had no difficulty in unhorsing him. 

There was great cheering from the Hatter s 
opponents, but he wasn't in the least abashed. 
** I did come off well that time, didn't I ?" he 
said to his supporters, as he rode back to his 
tent, at which they cheered with almost un- 
controllable enthusiasm. 



120 JOHN BULL^S ADVENTURES 

**Who dares to oppose our Joe?" the chal- 
lenge rang out again — as much, that is to say, 
as the Rabbit's voice could make it ring. 

This time it was a Knight named Goschen 
— one of the four whom John had seen in the 
ex-Chancellors' Box. 

The Hatter rode up, but in quite a different 
suit of armour, for his first suit had been 
smashed to little bits in his first combat 
• ** Only a skeleton ! " was his genial comment 
this time as the two combatants fell to. The 
result was precisely the same. The Skeleton 
Knight, though a veteran, showed such skill 
and deftness in conflict that the Hatter in a very 
short time was on the ground for a second time. 
He took it just as coolly, saying to his crowd, 
precisely as on the first occasion, " I did come off 
well that time, didn't I ?" the crowd cheering 
him for all the world just as if he had won. 

A third time the challenge rang forth, and 
this time in the challenger John recognised 
Twee-C.-B. When the Hatter saw who it 
was he rode back to his tent, and when he 
came out it was seen that he was wearing a 
feather in his cap. 



THE FISCAL TOURNAMENT 121 

Twee-C.-B. looked such a genial warrior 
that John was amazed to see the Hatter grow 
white with anger. 

**Only a Little Englander!" the Hatter 
shouted at the top of his voice. 

**Well, lets see which is the better man/' 
sang out A Voice. 

This led to great cheering and counter cheer- 
ing. The two Knights were at it before the 
echoes had died away, but the result was never 
in doubt. The Hatter, despite an entirely 
different set of argumentative armour, was 
easily floored. Even he seemed rather crest- 
fallen, but he made his customary remark and 
it got the customary cheer. 

As John felt certain would be the case, the 
next champion to enter the lists was Tweedle-R. 

** What a lot better he looks since he came 
out of his furrow ! " said the Bird. 

** His furrow?" repeated John, not under- 
standing in the least. 

** Yes," said the Bird. ** Some time ago he 
and Twee-C.-B. had a quarrel, and the end 
of it was that Tweedle-R. went off and lived 
in a Lonely Furrow." 



122 



JOHN BULL'S ADVENTURES 



"It sounds as if he had been ploughed," 
said John. 

** Tm not sure that he hadn't," said the 
Bird; **he would keep on examining himself, 
you know." 




THE MAD HATTER FIGHTS TWEEDLE-R. 

There was no time to pursue the topic 
further, because by this time the Knights were 
ready for the fray. Tweedle-R. was beautifully 
arrayed in Imperialistic armour, whilst this 
time the Hatter had a wonderful suit composed 



THE FISCAL TOURNAMENT 128 

of nothing but pearl buttons, all specially made 
(so the rumour ran in the crowd) at Birmingham 
by the few remaining survivors of that decayed 
industry. 

**Tinplates and personalities, indeed," was 
the Hatters polite greeting this time. The 
fight was a very graceful one. Tweedle-R. 
did not seem to exert himself, but in the 
most felicitous way possible got at the Great 
Man, whose supporters were growing visibly 
anxious. Nor was that anxiety lessened when 
in another moment he was sprawling on the 
turf 

** Are you going to take it lying down ? '' said 
A Voice. 

There was a great shout of laughter, which 
completely drowned what the Hatter said to 
his side of the arena, though as they cheered 
it was probably the same old shibboleth. 

In the next and (as it proved) the last of 
these single combats the Hatter's opponent 
was a Knight named Lord George. As he 
rode into the arena a shout of mocking welcome 
greeted him from the Hatters supporters. 
** Well, he must fancy himself" ; '' Cheek I call 



124 JOHN BULL'S ADVENTURES 

it"; ** He will get it'* — these were some of 
the cries which showed how certain they made 
the Hatter would have an easy victory. 

Certainly he did not look a very redoubtable 
adversary, and even amongst the Hatters 
opponents there was a shaking of heads as if 
they rather thought that this time the Hatter 
might not come out second best. 

The prospect of a more equal encounter 
intensified the excitement, and if pins ever 
made a noise when they drop on turf, you 
might have heard one drop as the two — the 
Hatter and Lord George — sat and glared at 
one another. 

** Now we shan't be long," said the Hatter, 
and he was quite right. For of all the 
champions none acquitted himself more re- 
doubtably than did Lord George. ** Well, I 
am surprised " ; ** Never knew it was in him " ; 
** That's the way to take care of your friends " 
— these were some of the delighted greetings 
of the crowd as they saw the Hatter get per- 
haps the most sorry beating he had had. The 
White Rabbit had to ^o and help him on to 
his horse, and all he could say as he rode to his

125 



tent was, " I came off better than ever that 
time." 




*I CAME OFF BETTER THAN EVER" 



There were lots of other Knights ready to 
fight the Hatter, but it was now announced that 
there would be no more single combats, but that 
there would be a general encounter between a 
dozen champions on either side. By this time 
it was getting dark, and John looked up to find 
the names of the warriors flashed on to a 



screen.

John recognised a good many old friends, as 
well as some whom he had seen for the first 
time fighting that day. The rest were explained 
to him by the Bird. Sherlock Holmes was 
fighting for the Hatter because nobody else 
had even a chance (let alone an even chance) 



THE FISCAL TOURNAMENT 127 

of discovering who was to benefit by his pro- 
posals. Dumpy Jim was a bosom friend of the 
Chaplin's ; they had hunted in couples all their 
life. The Daily Mail and Daily Express were 
paper Knights who fought because they were 
advised that it was good for their circulation. 
The editor of the Times thought the Hatter's 
plan could not fail to make people want to 
consult the Encyclopcedia Britannica to try 
to discover (if possible) its meaning. Mr. 
Benjamin Kidd was in the Hatters dozen 
because he was such a staunch Liberal. 

On the other side, of those whom John did 
not know, the Knight of Malwood was a 
veteran Knight who never lingered by his fire- 
side in the New Forest when a blow could be 
struck for Free Trade. The Ritchie Knight 
John recognised at once as the man who had 
driven the Hatter mad — he had seen him, too, 
in the ex-Chancellors' Box. Sunny Jim (of 
Hereford) was another veteran who was always 
ready for a fight against any sort of corruption. 
The Grey Knight looked very young, but had 
already won renown by his skill in tackling men 
as well as fishes. The Fowler came from the 



128 JOHN BULKS ADVENTURES 

Hatter's country, but was quite sure that this 
time he really was mad. St. Augustine Birrell 
was a Knight who, though he thought the pen 
mightier than the sword, knew right well how 
to wield both to good purpose. 

By the time the Bird had given John all this 
information, and answered John's numerous 
questions, the fight was in full swing. There 
is no need to describe it, as it was only a 
repetition on a larger scale of all the single 
combats that had preceded it. Even the 
Dormouse, who was asleep during the first few 
minutes, woke up and got in a number of 
astonishingly straight blows, most of them at 
the Hatter himself. The Mail and Express 
threw any amount of ink in the hope that some 
of it would stick, but the crowd easily saw 
through such peculiar tactics. Dumpy Jim was 
no match for Sunny Jim, though they were 
both first-class fighting men. As the fight pro- 
ceeded the Hatter got madder and madder, 
and John was wondering what would happen 
to him and to the White Rabbit, who wept 
bitterly, when gradually the immense cloud 
of dust kicked up in the course of the con- 




THE GENERAL M^LEE 



180 JOHN BULL'S ADVENTURES 

troversy entirely blotted out the fight from his 
view. 

** Tm off," said the Bird. ** Tm going to get 
back and write it all up for my paper." 

** Write it all down, I suppose you mean," 
said John ; but the Bird was in no mood for 
more explanations, and hurried on without 
answering. 

** Thank you so much for your kindness ; I 
shall never forget it," said John ; but the Bird 
was out of sight, and John could see nothing, 
whilst all he could hear was shouts in the 
distance of *'The trials beginning." 

** Come on," said the Pig, against whom John 
suddenly stumbled. The Pig caught hold of 
John by the hand, greatly to his relief, for he 
began to be afraid that this time he really was 
lost. 

** What trial is it ? " said John as clearly as 
he could between his breaths as they ran ; but 
the Pig only said, ** Forward," singing as he 
went (it was wonderful how he managed to have 
so much breath, for he was as fat as could be) —

CHAPTER XI 
WHO STOLE THE LOAVES? 

^ I ^HE King and Queen of Spades (who 
^ looked exactly like a workman and his 
wife in John Bull's own country) were seated 
on the throne when they arrived, with a great 
crowd assembled in court — all sorts of weird 
creatures, as well as the whole pack of cards ; 
the Mad Hatter (who turned out to be the 
Knave of Spades) was standing before them, 
with two young-looking soldiers on each side to 
guard him ; and near the King was the White 
Rabbit, with a trumpet (his own) in one hand 
and a large roll in the other. In the very 
middle of the court was a table, with a large 
number of loaves upon it ; it made John quite 
hungry to look at them. 

John had often been in a court of justice 
before, but never in one quite like this. The 

131 



132 JOHN BULLS ADVENTURES 

twelve jurors, all of them registered electors, 
were all writing very busily on their slates 
(some of them very dirty ones). **What are 
they all doing?'' John whispered to the Pig. 
" They can't want to write anything down yet 
before the trial's begun." 

** They're putting down their politics," the 
Pig whispered in reply> " for fear they should 
forget what they are before the end of the 
trial." 

'' Free and independent, indeed," John said 
in a loud, angry voice, but he stopped guiltily, 
for the White Rabbit cried out, '* Silence in the 
court ! " and the King put on his spectacles and 
looked anxiously round to see who was daring 
to talk. 

John could see quite well that all the jurors 
were writing down " Free and independent " on 
their slates, and some of them had heard so 
much talk about different sorts of trade that 
they actually didn't know how to spell ** free " 
and wrote down ** fair." " A nice muddle and 
mess their slates will be in before the trial's 
over," thought John. 



WHO STOLE THE LOAVES? 

*' Herald, read the accusation," said the King 
solemnly. 

The White Rabbit took up his trumpet and 




""illWiilll 



!F^ 



THE WHITE RABBIT AS HERALD 



tried to blow it. At first he could not get any 
sound out of it. 

At last, however, by a great effort there 



184 JOHN BULKS ADVENTURES 

came a ghostlike blast, but to the great amaze- 
ment of the Court it was only 

** Three Acres and a Cow'' 

The Mad Hatter looked madder than ever at 
this, and the White Rabbit tremblingly began 
to explain. 

*' If you please, your Majesty/* he said, ** my 
horn has been frozen for nearly twenty years, 
and now that it is thawed the old words have 
to come out first." 

''Where was the horn made.'*" said the 
King. 

*'In Birming " but before he had time 

to finish the word the Queen interrupted him 
by saying, ** It's always the way with them 
Brummagem things." 

The White Rabbit was so flurried and 
flustered that everybody saw he couldn't go on 
being Herald, so the King directed the Tin 
Soldier to take his place. 

The new Herald gave three long, low 
whistles, and then proceeded to unroll the 
scroll, which proved to be an enormous 
envelope bearing this curious inscription : — 



WHO STOLE THE LOAVES? 135 



TRADE AND THE EMPIRE. 

If yon Want to knoW What the KnaVe 
of Spades has done read the enclosed. 



CONSISTENT 

BIRMINQHAM." MADE IN GERMANY. 



Having opened it, he unrolled the leaflet 
which he found inside, and read as follows — 

The Queen of Spades y she baked some loaves 

All on her washing day ; 
The Knave of Spades ^ he stole those loaves 

And took them quite away ! 

"Consider your verdict," said the Hatter, 
as soon as he heard this read out. 

**Not yet," said the King; ** there's a great 
deal to come before that." 

**Call the prisoner," said the King. And 



136 elOHX BULUS ADVENTURES 

the Tin Soldier whistled three times and called 
out, *'The prisoner." 

This procedure puzzled John very much 
until one of the court cards explained that in 
the Fiscal Wonderland the defence always came 
before the prosecution, and that prisoners were 
allowed to give evidence themselves, as, indeed, 
John remembered, they now do in his own 
country. 

The Hatter came into the witness-box with 
a subscription list in one hand and a leaflet in 
the other. '* I beg pardon, your Majesty," he 
began, **for bringing these here, but I hadn't 
quite finished my Committee meeting when 
I was arrested and brought here." 

" You ought to have finished," said the King. 
** When did you begin ? " 

The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who 
was in court sitting arm in arm with the 
Dormouse. *' Fourteenth of May I ^Aink it 
was," he said. 

** Fifteenth," said the March Hare. 

** I read about it on the sixteenth," added the 
Dormouse. 

''Write that down," said the King to the 



WHO STOLE THE LOAVES? 137 

jury, and the jury at once wrote down all these 
dates on their slates, and then added them up 
in quinquennial periods and set out the result 
in imports and exports. 

*^ Where did you get that hat?" the King 
said to the Hatter, in a peculiar sing-song voice, 
as if it were part of a tune. 

** It came from abroad," said the Hatter. 

''Dumped !'' the King exclaimed, turning to 
the jury, who instantly wrote down the word, 
though they hadn't an idea what it meant. 

'' I bought the hat," added the Hatter, by 
way of explanation, " in my free-trading days. 
I haven t wanted a new one since." 

Here, since the question was one of hats, the 
Queen seemed very interested, and stared hard 
at the Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted. 

** Give your evidence," said the King, ** and 
don't shuffle about so much, or Til have you 
exported on the spot." 

This seemed to disconcert the witness a good 
deal; he kept shifting from one foot to the 
other, and in his confusion made a lot of 
corrections in the subscription list, instead of 
the leaflet. 



188 JOHN BULi;S ADVENTURES 

Just at this moment John discovered that he 
was growing large again. At first he thought 
of leaving the court, but on second thoughts 
decided to see the trial through, as long as 
there was room in the court. 

*' I wish you wouldn't squeeze so," said the 
Dormouse, who was sitting next to him ; **I can 
hardly sleep a wink." 

'* I can't help it," said John ; ''Vm growing." 

'* You've no right to grow," said the Hatter, 
who overheard the conversation. (He wasn't 
a very polite Hatter.) '* I've told everybody 
you're in a decline." 

** Don't talk nonsense," said John, annoyed 
at being lectured by the prisoner. 

** It's no sense the way you're squeezing me J* 
said the Dormouse, as he got up and chose a 
fresh seat as far away as he could from John. 

All this time the Queen had never left off 
staring at the Hatter, and now she said all at 
once to one of the whips, '* Bring me a list of 
the members of the last Liberal Government," 
on which the Hatter trembled so that he almost 
turned his coat. 

'*Give your evidence," the King repeated 



WHO STOLE THE LOAVES? 139 

angrily, '*or Til have you exported, whether 
you re a Privy Councillor or not." 

** Tm a patriotic man, your Majesty," the 
Hatter began in an assertive voice, "and I 
hadn't started my Committee — not above 
Austen and Jesse — and what with the Educa- 
tion Act working so thin — and the War 
Commission coming it so thick — and the 
cristling of the sea " 

" The cristling of the what f " said the King. 

** I begin with a C," the Hatter replied. 

** Of course cristling begins with a C," said 
the King sharply, ''but this isn't a spelling 
bee, sir ! Go on ! " 

" Tm a patriotic man," the Hatter went on, 
**and most things crystalled after that — and 
the March Hare quite agreed " 

** I didn't," the March Hare interrupted in a 
great hurry. 

''You did," said the Hatter. 

" I mean, I did," said the March Hare, 
who seemed afraid of disagreeing with the 
Hatter. 

" He admits it," said the King to the jury ; 
"be sure you put that down." 



140 JOHN BrLUS ADVENTURES 

"After that," the Hatter went on, *'all the 
rest went off to the inquest " 

** But what did you do?" said one of the 
jury. 

**Oh, I began to write leaflets," said the 
Hatter, and proceeded to hand one to each of 
the jury. Oddly enough, the Tin Soldier 
actually helped him to do it until this skilful 
game was stopped by the King, in a very 
stern voice, ordering all the leaflets to be im- 
pounded. 

That was a very hard word, which made John 
Bull wonder what would happen, but all that 
did happen was that the leaflets were collected 
and given to the King and Queen, who im- 
mediately began to study them intently. 

One that was headed ** The Cost of Living " 
seemed to excite the Queen very much, and at 
last, when she had read it through, she said, 
** You'd soon know about the cost of living if 
you had to feed as many mouths as I have." 

Here a dozen or so of children who were in 
court cheered heartily, they were so excited at 
hearing their mother make such a long speech 
in public. 



WHO STOLE THE LOAVES? 141 

'' The figures are all wrong," said the King 
sternly. 

**Of course they are," said the Hatter, '*but 
then, you see, the figures are only illustrations. 
I do not pretend that they are proofs ; the 
proofs will be found in the argument, and not 
in the figures. But I use figures as illustrations 
to show what the argument is." 

The Tin Soldier and the White Rabbit 
(who had crept back into court) made an 
attempt at a cheer, but it was a very feeble one. 

What the King said was, ** If that*s all you 
can say, you may stand down." 

'* I can't go no lower," said the Hatter ; 
** IVe played it pretty low down as it is 
already. " 

'*Then you must take it lying down," said 
the King, with a chuckle, as if by saying that 
he in some way scored off the prisoner. 

As it was, the Hatter was put back into the 
dock, where he was again taken charge of by 
the two soldiers (whose names were Winston 
and Hugh) after an unsuccessful attempt had 
been made to rescue the Hatter by some ill- 
favoured loafers, who shouted all the time, 



142 JOHN BULL^S ADVENl^URES 

** Shall the Radicals be allowed to attack our 
Joe?" 

** Call the next witness," said the King. 

John watched the Tin Soldier as he fumbled 
over the list, feeling very interested to know 
who the next witness would be — *'for they 
haven't made much of a defence yet," he said 
to himself. Great was his surprise when the 
Tin Soldier looked at him and said, with an air 
of immense authority, "John Bull!" 



CHAPTER XII 
JOHN BULKS EVIDENCE 

** T T ERE," said John, quite forgetting how 

^ ^ much bigger than the rest he was, and 
he jumped up in such a hurry that he com- 
pletely upset the jury-box. Over they went 
into the court, slates and all, and they had to 
be collected and put back into their places, 
though they none of them got their own slates 
again, with the result that they got more and 
more muddled as the trial proceeded. 

'* What do you know about this business .-^'^ 
the King said to John. 

" Everything," said John. 

** Everything imaginable ?" said the King. 

*' Everything real and imaginable," said John. 

''That's not true," said the March Hare 
from the body of the court. 

This caused a great commotion, but when 
the Tin Soldier had got some sort of order 

143 



144 JOHN BULKS ADVENTURES 

again the March Hare added, ** He basnet 
seen my second pamphlet." 

'* That's quite true, your Majesty," said John, 
who had grown wonderfully self-possessed, 
'*but I know what's in it." 

The March Hare hurriedly felt his pocket. 

" It s only one of the Hatter s leaflets," said 
John, **with all the short words taken out and 
long ones put in in their place." 

This led to a regular scene. A Wicket- 
keeper, saying that he's known the March 
Hare all his life and had perfect faith in his 
honour, tried to get at John Bull, and nearly 
lost his own seat in consequence. Almost every- 
body shouted something or other except the 
March Hare, who, looking very flushed, kept 
absolutely silent. It was whispered in court 
that this was because he had nothing to say. 

The King thought the only thing to do was 
to finish the trial as quickly as possible. ** Con- 
sider your verdict," he said to the jury in a 
low, trembling voice. 

** Please your Majesty," said the Tin Soldier, 
** there's a witness waiting outside who's dread- 
fully anxious to give evidence." 



JOHN BULLS EVIDENCE 



145 



** Let him appear/* said the King, and all the 
Court eagerly awaited the appearance of this 
new witness. 

The door opened, and then, to the amaze-

ment of everybody, the court waiters brought 
in a large dish with an enormous Leg ot 
Mutton on it, and placed it on top of the 
witness-box. 

Without waiting to be introduced, the Leg 

L 



146 JOHN BULKS ADVENTURES 

of Mutton got up and bowed to the King and 
Queen, but before it had time to say anything 
a great shout of laughter went up as everybody 
saw who it was. 

*' Take it away," said the King, and away it 
was carried, muttering as it went something 
about the cold shoulder. 

** Consider your verdict," said the King once 
again. 

** Please your Majesty," said the Tin Soldier, 
**this paper has just been picked up." 

** Another leaflet,*' said the Queen. 

** I haven't opened it yet," said the Tin 
Soldier; **but it seems to be a letter in the 
prisoner's writing." 

*' Who is it directed to ? " said one of the 
jurymen. 

" It hasn't got any direction," said the Tin 
Soldier; **in fact, it isn't a letter, it's a set of 
verses." 

** And not in the Hatter's handwriting ? " said 
the King. 

'*No," said the Tin Soldier; *'and I know 
his handwriting well." 



JOHN BULL^S EVIDENCE 147 

** He must have forced somebody else s 
hand," said the King. 

" Please your Majesty," said the Hatter, 
**you can't prove I wrote the verses. There's 
no reason for what I did, and there can't be 
any rhyme either." 

The Tin Soldier and the White Rabbit 
clapped their hands vigorously at this clever 
repartee, but the Queen frowned and said, ** I 
think that proves his guilt." 

** Nothing of the kind," said the Hatter 
jauntily. 

** Read the verses," said the King. 

These were the verses which the Tin Soldier 

read — 

They told me when I made the stir, 

You called and found him in ; 
He gave me a good character, 
But said I should not win. 

They wondered all if I had gone 

( We knew it to be true) ; 
If I should push the matter on. 

What would become of you ? 

They hit me one, I hit them two. 
You gave them three or more ; 

They all returned from me to you. 
Though most were mine before. 



148 JOHN BULUS AD\TENTURES

Involved by this affair ^

Exactly as we were. 

My notion was that he had been

*' That's the most damning piece of evidence 
weVe heard yet," said the King; "so now let 
the jury " 

** If any one of them/' said the Hatter, grow- 
ing desperate, *'can explain it, I pledge myself 
that his cost of living shall never be increased. 
In fact" (and here he burst into song) — 

^^ I pledge my word the Empire needs Protection ; , 

I pledge my word that through Protection we will 
gain ; 
I pledge my word that this will benefit the nation— 
These are the words of Joseph Chamberlain, 

I assert that there isn't an atom of meaning 
in it." 



/ 



JOHN BULL^S EVIDENCE 149 

The jury all wrote down on each other's 
slate: ''He asserts there isn't an atom of 
meaning in it." 

"If there's no meaning in it," said the King, 
** that would save a world of trouble. And yet 
I don't know," he went on, holding up the 
verses to the light. ** I seem to see some 
meaning in them after all — ' said I should not 
win' You can't win, can you.*^" he added, 
turning to the Hatter. 

The Hatter shook his head despairingly. 
'' I always say I can, but do I look like it.'*" 
he said. (Which he certainly did not, being 
entirely clad in fustian.) 

" All right so far," said the King, and he 
went on muttering through the verses : ** ' If I 
should push the matter on ' — that looks as if 
it had' something to do with pushfulness. * They 
hit me one, I hit them two ' — now, that must 
mean something you did." 

''Yes," said the Dormouse in a rare interval 
of wakefulness, '' that's how he always used to 
translate ' Bis dat qui cito dat' " 

'* Quite so," said the King, delighted to have 
his authority supported from such a very un- 



150

expected quarter. ** Let the jury consider their 
verdict." 

** No, no ! " shrieked the Hatter, growing

madder than ever. ** Policy first, inquiry after- 
wards." 

** Stuff and nonsense ! " said John. " The 
idea of make-believing to inquire into what 
you know beforehand ! " 



JOHN BULKS EVIDENCE 161 

"Hold your tongue ! " said the Hatter. 
*'l wont! ''said John Bull. 
" Off with his head ! '* said the Hatter. 
**Who cares for you?" said John Bull. 
** Why, you're nothing but a Protectionist." 




THE HATTER IN PRISON 



** Take him away," said the King and Queen 
together in stern voices, and the two soldiers 
at once led off the Mad Hatter to prison. 
When he had gone the Tin Soldier and the 
White Rabbit made a dash at John. He tried 
to beat them off, and found himself in his arm- 



162 JOHN BULCS ADVENTURES 

chair with Britannia beside him trying to keep 
away the flies that buzzed around him. 

** Wake up, John, dear," said Britannia. 

**A11 right. Your Royal Highness," said 
John Bull, only half awake. 

** Royal Highness, indeed!'' said Britannia. 
** You have grown polite in your sleep." 

**Oh! Tve had such a real sort of adven- 
ture," said John, seeing it was only Britannia, 
and he told her all he could remember of his 
doings in the Fiscal Wonderland. 

When he had finished his wife kissed him, 
and said, *' It was a bad dream, dear, certainly ; 
youVe only yourself to thank if it ever does 
come true. But now come and have your 
dinner ; it's getting late." 

So John went and dined wisely and well 
(but not too well), thinking whilst he enjoyed 
his dinner how fortunate he was to have such 
good food, such cheap food, and such plenty 
of it.

WORLD'S TRAGEDY. Thirty-Eighth 
Edition, 

' The tender reverence of the treatment 
and the imaginative beauty of the writing 
have reconciled us to the daring of the con- 
ception. This "Dream of the World's 
Tragedy" is a lofty and not inadequate 
paraphrase of the supreme climax ox the 
inspired narrative.' — Dublin Retfiew, 

THE SORROWS OF SATAN. Forty- 
Sixth Edition. 

* A very powerful piece of work. . . . 
The conception is magnificent, and is likely 
to win an abiding place within the memory 
of man. . . • The author has immense com- 
mand of language, and a limitless audacity. 
. . . This interesting and remarkable romance 
will live long after much of the ephemeral 
literature of the day b forgotten. ... A 
literary phenomenon . . . novel, and even 
sublime. —W. T. Stead in the Review 
0/ Reviews. 

THE MASTER CHRISTIAN. 

[165M Thousand. 
• It cannot be denied that "The Master 



Christian" is a powerful book ; that it is one 
likely to raise uncomfortable questions in 
all but the most self>satisfied readers, and 
that it strikes at the root of the failure of 
the Churches— the decay of faith— in a 
manner which shows the inevitable disaster 
heaping up . . . The good Cardinal Bonpr6 
is a beautiful figure, fit to stand beside the 
good Bishop in " Les Mis^rables." It is a 
book with a serious pur^se expressed with 
absolute tinconventionality and passion . . . 
And this is to say it is a book worUi resA- 
ing.' ^Examiner. 
TEMPORAL POWER: A STUDY IN 
SUPREMACY. 

[150th Thousand. 
' It is impossible to read such a work as 
" Temporal Power" without becoming con- 
vinced that the story is intended to convey 
certain criticisms on the ways of the world 
and certain suggestions for the betterment 
of humanity. . . . The chief characteristics 
of the book are an attack on conventional 
prejudices and manners and on cert^n 
practices attributed to the Roman Church 
(the policy of M. Combes makes parts of the 
novel specially up to date), and the pro- 
pounding pf theories for the improvement 
of the social and political systems. ... If 
the chief intention of the book was to hold 
the mirror up to shams, injustice, dishonesty, 
cruelty, and neglect of conscience, nothing 
but praise can tw given to that intention.' — 
Morning Post, 



THE GOD IN THE CAR. NinthEdition. 
' A very remarkable book, deserving of 
critical analysis impossible within our limit ; 
brilliant, but not superficial ; well con- 
sidered, but not elaborated; constructed

yet allows itself to be enjoyed by readers 
to whom fine literary method is a keen
