INTRODUCTION

HIS GUFFAWGRAPH is intended to forin a refuge for destitute wit — an
DELO
asylum for the thousands of orphan jokes — the superannuated Joe Millers — the
millions of perishing puns, which are now wandering about without so much as a
shelf to rest upon! It is also devoted to the emancipation of the Jew d'esprits all
over the world, and the naturalization of those alien JONATHANS, whose adherence
to the truth has forced them to emigrate from their native land.
has the honour of making his appearance every Saturday, and continues, from week to
week, to offer to the world all the fun to be found in his own and the following heads :
POLITICS.
“Punch" has no party prejudices-he is conservative in his oppositio:1 to Fantoccini and political puppets, but a
progressive whig in his love of small change.
FASHIONS.
This department is conducted by Mrs. J. Punch, whose extensive acquaintance with the élite of the areas enables her to
furnish the earliest information of the movements of the Fashionable World.
POLICE.
This portion of the work is under the direction of an experienced nobleman—a regular attendant at the various offices —
who, from a strong attachment to “Puncu,” is frequently in a position to supply exclusive reports.

PUNCH'S INTRODUCTION.
IN REVIEWS.
To render this branch of the periodical as perfect as possible, arrangements have been made to secure the critical assistance
of John Ketch, Esq., who, from the mildness of the law, and the congenial character of modern literature with his early
associations, has been induced to undertake its execution. .
FINE ARTS.
Anxious to do justice to native talent, the criticisms upon Painting, Sculpture, &c., are confided to one of the most
popular artists of the day—“Punch’s ” own immortal scene-painter.
MUSIC AND THE DRAMA.
These are amongst the most prominent features of the work. The Musical Notices are written by the gentleman who
plays the mouth-organ, assisted by the professors of the drum and cymbals. "Punch” himself does the Drama.
SPORTING
A Prophet is engaged!
He foretells not only the winners of each race, but also the “VATES” and colours of the riders.
THE FACETIÆ
Are contributed by the members of the following learned bodies :-
THE COURT OF COMMON COUNCIL AND THE ZOOLOGICAL AND THE HIGHGATE CEMETERY :-THE DRAMATIC AUTHORS'
SOCIETY: -- THE TEMPERANCE ASSOCIATION AND THE
AND THE MENDICITY SOCIETIES :-THE BEEFSTEAK CLUB
WATERPROOFING COMPANY :-THE COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS AND THE ANTI-DRY-ROT COMPANY.

ON THE INTRODUCTION OF PANTOMIME INTO But in order to exhibit the capacities of this noble art in all their compre-

hensive excellence, it is requisite that we should, in the first place, say a
few words upon language in general.
It is commonly supposed that there are but two kinds of language among
men—the written and the spoken: whereas it follows, from the very nature
of language itself, that there must necessarily be as many modes of
conveying our impressions to our fellow-creatures, as there are senses
or modes of receiving impressions in them. Accordingly, there are five
senses and five languages; to wit, the audible, the visible, the olfactory,
the gustatory, and the sensitive. To the two first belong speech and
literature. As illustrations of the third, or olfactory language, may
be cited the presentation of a pinch of Prince's Mixture to a stranger,
or a bottle of “ Bouquet du Roi” to a fair acquaintance; both of
which are but forms of expressing to them nasally our respect. The
nose, however, is an organ but little cultivated in man, and the
language which appeals to it is therefore in a very imperfect state ;
not so the gustatory, or that which addresses itself to the palate.
This, indeed, may be said to be imbibed with our mother's milk. What
words can speak affection to the child like elecampane-what language
assures us of the remembrance of an absent friend like a brace of wood-
cocks? Then who does not comprehend the eloquence of dinners ? A

refined portion of the British public,' the advantage that must neces-

proving to them its vast superiority over the comparatively tedious opera-
tions of speech, and exhibiting its capacity of conveying a far greater
quantity of thought in a considerably less space of time, and that with a
saving of one half the muscular exertion-a point so perfectly consonant
with the present prevailing desire for cheap and rapid communication

actually to introduce and cherish it among them as the most polite and
useful of all accomplishments.

It is currently reported at the Conservative Cluds, that if their party

grateful for support from any quarter ; but we much doubt the practica-

REVIEW.
Two Prize Essays. By Lord MELBOURNE and Sir Robert Peel.
8 vols. folio London: Messrs. SOFTSKIN and TiNGLE, Downing-street.
We congratulate the refined and sensitive publishers on the production
of these elaborately-written gilt-edged folios, and trust that no remarks will
issue from the press calculated to affect the digestion of any of the parties
concerned. The sale of the volumes will, no doubt, be commensurate with
the public spirit, the wisdom, and the benevolence which has uniformily
characterised the career of their illustrious authors. Two more statesman-
like volumes never issued from the press ; in fact, the books may be
regarded as typical of all statesmen. The subject, or rather the line of
argument, is thus designated by the respective writers :
Essay 1.—“On the Fine Art of Gorvernment, or how to do the least
possible good to the country in the longest possible time, and enjoy, mean-
while, the most ease and luxury.” By LORD MELBOURNE.
Essay II.-“ On the Science of Governing, or how to do the utmost
possible good for ourselves in the shortest possible time, under the name of
our altars, and our throne, and everybody that is good and wise. By Sir
ROBERT PEEL.
We are quite unable to enter into a review of these very costly produc-
tions, an estimate of the value of which the public will be sure to receive
from“ authority,” and be required to meet the amount, not only with
cheerful loyalty, but a more weighty and less noisy acknowledgment.
As to the Prize, it has been adjudged by PUNCH to be divided equally
between the two illustrious essayists; to the one, in virtue of his incorri-
gible laziness, and to the other, in honour of his audacious rapacity.

Punch begs to inform the inhabitants of Great Britain, Ireland, and
the Isle of Dogs, that he has just opened on an entirely new line, an Uni-
versal Comic Railroad, and Cosmopolitan Pleasure Van, for the trans-
mission of bon mots, puns, witticisms, humourous passengers, and queer
figures, to every part of the world. The engines have been constructed on
the most laughable principles, and being on the high pressure principle,
the manager has provided a vast number of patent anti-explosive fun-
belts, to secure his passengers against the danger of suddenly bursting.
The train starts every Saturday morning, under the guidance of an ex-
perienced punster. The departure of the train is always attended with
immense laughter, and a tremendous rush to the booking-office. Punch,
therefore, requests those who purpose taking places to apply early, as

REVENGE IS SWEET.
The Tories in Beverley have been wreaking their vengeance on their op-
ponents at the late election, by ordering their tradesmen who voted against
the Conservative candidate to send in their bills. Mr. Duncombe declares
that this is a mode of revenge he would never condescend to adopt.

CIVILIZATION.

Head of a Botecudo previous to disfigurement.]
od
“ If an European," says Sir Joshua Reynolds, in one of his discourses,
“when he has cut off his beard, and put false hair on his head, or bound up his
own hair in formal, hard knots, as unlike nature as he can make it, and after
having rendered them immoveable by the help of the fat of hogs, has covered
the whole with flour, laid on by a machine with the utmost regularity—if,
when thus attired, he issues forth and meets a Cherokee Indian who has be-
stowed as much time at his toilet, and laid with equal care and attention
his yellow and red ochre on such parts of his forehead and cheeks as he
judges most becoming, whichever of these two despises the other for this
attention to the fashion of his country, whichever first feels himself pro-
voked to laugh, is the barbarian."
Granting this, the popular advocates of civilization certainly are not the
most civilized of individuals. They appear to consider yellow ocbre and
peacocks' feathers the climax of barbarism-marabouts and kalydor the
acme of refinement. A ring through the nose calls forth their deepest
pity-a diamond drop to the ear commands their highest respect. 'To
them, nothing can show a more degraded state of nature than a New Zea-
land chief, with his distinctive coat of arms emblazoned on the skin of his
face; nor anything greater social elevation than an English peer, with the
glittering label of his " nobility” tacked to his breast. To a rational mind,
he one is not a whit more barbarous than the other ; they being, as Sir
Joshua observes, the real barbarians who, like these soi-disant civilizers,
would look upon their own monstrosities as the sole standard of excellence.
The philosophy of the present age, however, is peculiarly the philosophy
of outsides. Few dive deeper into the human breast than the bosom of the
shirt. Who could doubt the heart that beats beneath a cambric front? or
who imagine that hand accustomed to dirty work which is enveloped in
white kid? What Prometheus was to the physical, Stultz is to the moral
man--the one made human beings out of clay, the other cuts characters
out of broad-cloth. Gentility is, with us, a thing of the goose and shears ;
and nobility an attribute-not of the mind, but (supreme civilization !) of
a garter!
Certain modern advocates appear to be devout believers in this external
philosophy. They are touchingly eloquent upon the savage state of those
who indulge in yellow ochre, but conveniently mute upon the condition of
those who prefer carmine. They are beautifully alive to the degradation of
that race of people which crushes the feet of its children, but wonderfully
dead to the barbarism of that race, nearer home, which performs a like ope.
ration upon the ribs of its females. By them, also, we are told that “ words
would manifestly fail in pourtraying so low a state of morals as is pictured in
the lineaments of an Australian chief,”-a stretch of the outside philosophy
which we certainly were not prepared to meet with ; for little did we dream
that this noble science could ever have attained such eminence, that men
of intellect would be able to discover immorality in particular noses, and
crime in a certain conformation of the chin.
That an over-attention to the adornment of the person is a barbarism, all
must allow ; but that the pride which prompts the Esquimaux to stuff bits
of stone through a hole in his cheek, is a jot less refined than that which
urges the dowager-duchess to thrust coloured crystals through a hole in
her ear, certainly requires a peculiar kind of mental squint to perceive.
Surely there is as great a want of refinement among us, in this respect, as
among the natives of New Zealand. Why rush for subjects for civiliza-
tion to the backwoods of America, when thousands may be found, any fine
afternoon, in Regent-street? Why fly to Biddy Salamander and Bulkabra,
when the Queen of Beauty and Count D'Orsay have equally urgent claims
on the attention and sympathies of the civiliser ?
On the subject of civilization, two questions naturally present themselves
-the one, what is civilization ?-the other, have we such a superabund-
ance of that commodity among us, that we should think about exporting
it? To the former question, the journal especially devoted to the subject
has, to the best of our belief, never condescended a reply; although, like
the celebrated argument on the colour of the chameleon, no two persons,
perhaps, have the same idea of it. In what then, does civilization consist,
and how is it to be generally promoted ? Does it, as Sir E. L. B-
would doubtlessly assure us, does it lie in a strict adherence to the last
month's fashions; and is it to be propagated throughout the world only by
missionaries from Nugee's, and by the universal dissemination of curling-
tongs and Macassar-patent leather boots and opera hats—white cam-
bric pocket-handkerchiefs and lavender-water? Or, does it consist, as the
Countess of B-
ntess of B-
would endeavour to convince us, in abstaining
from partaking twice of fish, and from eating peas with the knife ? and is
it to be made common among mankind only by distributing silver forks
and finger glasses to barbarians, and printing the Book of Etiquette for
gratuitous circulation among them? Or, is it, as the mild and humane
Judge P- would prove to us, a necessary result of the Statutes at
Large ; and can it be rendered universal only by sending out Jack Ketch
as a missionary by the introduction of rope-walk
the erection of gallows all over the world ? Or, is it, as the Archbishop of
Canterbury contests, to be achieved solely by the dissemination of bishops,
and by diffusing among the poor benighted negroes the blessings of ser-
mons, tithes, and church-rates ? Christianity, it has, on the other hand
been asserted, is the only practical system of civilization ; but this is mani-
festly the idea of a visionary. For ourselves, we must confess we incline
to the opposite opinion; and think either the bishops or Jack Ketch (we
hardly know which we prefer) by far the more rational means. Indeed,
when we consider the high state of civilization which this country has at-
tained, and imagine for an instant the awful amount of distress which
would necessarily accrue from the general practice of Christianity among
us, even for a week, it is clear that the idea never could be entertained by
any moral or religious mind. A week's Christianity in England! What
would become of the lawyers and parsons? It is too terrible to contents

THE EXPLOSIVE BOX.
Sir HUSSEY Vivian was relating to Sir Robert Peel the failure of the
Duke of Normandie's experiment with a terrible self-explosive box, which
he had buried in a mound at Woolwich, in the expectation that it would
shortly blow up, but which still remains there, to the great terror of the

Lord John Russell had served him the same trick, by burying the corn-
law question under the Treasury bench. No one knew at what moment it

The liorrors of an omnibus,
Indeed, I've cause to curse ;
And if I ride in one again,
I hope 'twill be my hearse.
If you a journey have to go,
And thiey make no delay,
'Tis ten to one you're serv'd like curds,
They spill you on the whey,
A short time since my wife and I,
A short call had to make,
And giving me a kiss, she said-
“ Ä buss you'd better take !"
We journey'd on-two lively cads,
Were for our custom, triers;
And, in a twinkling, we were fix'd
Fast by this pair of pliers !
My wife's arm I had lock'd in mine,
But soon they forc'd her from it;
And she was lugg'd into the Sun,
And I into the Comet!
Jamm'd to a jelly, there I sat,
Each one against me pushing;
And my poor gouty legs seem'd made
For each one's pins—a cushion !
My wife some time had gone before:
I urg'd the jarvey's speed,
When all at once the bus set off
At fearful pace, indeed !
I ask'd the coachee what caused this ?
When thus his story ran :-
“ Vy, a man shied at an oss, and so
An oss shied at a man !"
Oh, fearful crash ! oh, fearful smash !
At such a rate we run,
That presently the Comet came
In contact with the Sun.
At that sad time each body felt,
As parting with its soul,
We were, indeed, a little whirled,
And shook from pole to pole !
EXCLUSIVE INTELLIGENCE.
(From our West-end and “ The Observer's” Correspondent.)
We have every reason to believe, unless a very respectable authority,
on whom we are in the habit of relying, has grievously imposed upon us,
that a very illustrious personage has consulted a certain exalted individual
as to whether a certain other persou, no less exalted than the latter, but
not so illustrious as the former, shall be employed in a certain approaching
event, which at present is involved in the greatest uncertainty. Another
individual, who is more dignified than the third person
sonage above alluded
to, but not nearly so illustrious as the first, and not half so exalted as the
second, has nothing whatever to do with the matter above hinted at, and
it is not at all probable that he will be ever in the smallest way mixed up
with it. For this purpose we have cautiously abstained from giving his
name, and indeed only allude to him that there may be no misapprehen-
sion on this very delicate subject.
ANIMAL MAGNETISM,
The Times gives a horrible description of some mesmeric experiments by
a M. Delafontaine, by which a boy was deprived of all sensation. We
suspect that some one has been operating upon the Poor Law Commis-
sioners, for their total want of feeling is a mesmeric phenomenon.
NOTHING WONDERFUL.
The Duke of Normandie accounts for the non-explosion of his percussion-
shells, by the fact of having incautiously used some of M'Culloch's
pamphlets on the corn laws. If this be the case, no person can be surprised
at their not going off.
Dunn, the miller of Wimbledon las recently given his infant the Christian
name of Cardigan. If there is truth in the adage of "give a dog a bad
name and hang him," the poor child has little else in perspective than the

height he stands upon.
It may be, and has been, urged by some, that the Thames is not exactly
the place to form the naval character; that a habit of braving the “dangers
of the deep” is hardly to be acquired where one may walk across at low
tide, on account of the water being so confoundedly shallow : but these are
cavillings which the lofty and truly patriotic mind will at once and indig-
nantly repudiate. The humble urchin, whose sole duty consists in throwing
out a rope to each pier, and holding hard by it while the vessel stops, may
one day be destined for some higher service : and where is the English
bosom that will not beat at the thought, that the dirty lad below, whose
exclamations of “ Ease her!-stop her!one turn ahead!” may one day be
destined to give the word of command on the quarter-deck, and receive, in
the shape of a cannon-ball, a glorious full stop to his honourable services !
Looking as we do at the above-bridge navy, in a large and national light,
we are not inclined to go into critical details, such as are to be met with,
passim, in the shrewd and amusing work of “The Passenger on board the
Bachelor.” There may be something in the objection, that there is no

Shakspere is attempted on the other side of the Thames.
The qualifications demanded of an actor by the usual run of Surrey
audiences are lungs of undeniable efficiency, limbs which will admit of every
variety of contortion, and a talent for broad-sword combats. How, then,
could the new Macbeth—a Mr. Graham-think of choosing this theatre for
his first appearance ? His deportment is quiet, and his voice weak. It
has, for instance, been usually thought, by most actors, that after a gentle-
man has murdered his sovereign, and caused a similar peccadillo to be com-
mitted upon his dearest friend, he would be, in some degree, agitated, and
put out of the even tenor of his way, when the ghost of Banquo appears
at the banquet. On such an occasion, John Kemble and Edmund Kean
used to think it advisable to start with an expression of terror or horror ;
but Mr. Graham indulges us with a new reading. He carefully places one
foot somewhat in advance of the other, and puts his hands together with
the utmost deliberation. Again, he says mildly-
"Avaunt ! and quit my sight! Let the earth hide thee !"
in a tone which would well befit the situation, if the text ran thus :-
“Dear me, how singular! Pray go!"
When he does attempt to vociferate, the asthmatic complaint under which
he evidently labours, prevents him from delivering the sentences in more
copious instalments than the following :-
“I'll fight-till-from my bones—my flesh-be hacked !"

Every body knows there are planets in the air, which are called the

has two poles, but what is the axis, and what the poles are made of -
whether of wood, or any other material-are matters which, as far as the
mass are concerned, are involved in the greatest possible obscurity.
The north pole is chiefly remarkable for no one having ever succeeded
in reaching it, though there seems to have been a regular communication
to it by post, in the time of Pope, whose lines--

bability is, that from its intense heat, the whole must have boiled away
long ago, or put itself out, which is rather more feasible.
We do not think it necessary to go into the planets, for, if we did, it is
not unlikely we should be some time before we got out again; but we
shall say a few words about our own Earth, in which our readers must, of
course, take a special interest.
It has been decided, that, viewed from the moon, our globe presents a
mottled appearance ; but, as this assertion can possibly rest on no better
authority than that of the Man in the Moon, we must decline putting the
smallest faith in it.
It is calculated that a day in the moon lasts just a fortnight, and that the
night is of the same duration. If this be the case, the watchmen in the
moon must be horridly over-worked, and daily labourers must be fatigued
in proportion. When the moon is on the increase, it is seen in the cres-
cent; but whether Mornington-crescent or Burton-crescent, or any other
crescent in particular, has not been mentioned by either ancient or modern
astronomers. The only articles we get from the moon, are moonlight and
madness. Lunar caustic is not derived from the planet alluded to. .
Of the stars, one of the most brilliant is Sirius, or the Dog-star, which it
is calculated gives just one-twenty-millionth part of the light of the sun, or
about as much as that of a farthing rushlight. It would seem that such a
shabby degree of brilliancy was hardly worth having ; but when it is re-

THE ADVANTAGES OF ANIMAL MAGNETISM.
The experiments of M. Delafontaine have again raised an outcry against
this noble science, from the apparent absence of any benefit likely to arise
from it, beyond converting human beings into pincushions and galvanic
dummies. We, who look deeper into things than the generality of the
world, hail it as an inestimable boon to mankind, and proceed at once to
answer the numerous enquirers as to the cui bono of this novel soporific.
By a judicious application of the mesmeric fluid, the greatest domestic
comfort can be insured at the least possible trouble. The happiest Benedict
is too well aware that ladies will occasionally exercise their tongues in a
way not altogether compatible with marital ideas of quietude. A few
passes of the hand (" in the way of kindness for he who would,” &c. vide
Tobin) will now silence the most powerful oral battery; and Tacitus him-
self might, with the aid of mesmerism, pitch his study in a milliner's work-
room. Hen-pecked husbands have now other means at their command,
to secure quiet, than their razors and their garters. We have experi-
mentalised upon our Judy, and find it answer to a miracle. Mrs. John-
son may shut up her laboratory for American Soothing Syrup; mesmerism
is the only panacea for those morning and evening infantine ebullitions
which affectionate mammas always assign to the teeth, the wind, or a pain
in the stomach, and never to that possible cause, a pain in the temper.
Mesmerism is “ the real blessing to mothers," and Elliotson the Mrs.
Johnson of the day. We have tried it upon our Punchininny, and find
it superior to our old practice of throwing him out of the window.
Lovers, to you it is a boon sent by Cupid. Mammas, who will keep in the
room when your bosoms are bursting with adoration-fathers, who will
wake on the morning of an elopement, when the last trunk and the parrot
are confided to you from the window-bailiffs, who will hunt you up and
down their bailiwick, even to the church-door, though a heiress is depend-
ing upon your character for weekly payments-all are rendered powerless
and unobtrusive by this inexplicable palmistry. Candidates, save your
money ; mesmerise your opponents instead of bribing them, and you may
become a patriot by a show of hands.
These are a few of its social advantages--its political uses are unbounded.
Why not mesmerise the Chinese ? and, as for the Chartists, call out Dela-
fontaine instead of the magistrates a few mesmeric passes would be an
easy and efficient substitute for the “ Riot Act.” Then the powers of
clairvoyance—the faculty of seeing with their eyes shut-that it gives to
the patient. Mrs. Ratsey, your royal charge might be soothed and in-
structed at the same time, by substituting a sheet of Punch for the purple
and fine linen of her little Royal Highness's nautilus-shell.
Lord John Russell, the policy of your wily adversary would no longer
be concealed. Jealous husbands, do you not see a haven of security, for
brick walls may be seen through, and letters read in the pocket of your
rival, by this magnetic telescope ? whilst studious young gentleman may
place Homer under their arms, and study Greek without looking at it.

we further ask, knows how hot it is when the mercury stands at 120°, or
how cold it is when opposite 22° of Fahrenheit? Only the initiated, a
class of persons that can generally stand fire, like salamanders, or make
themselves comfortable in an ice-house.
Deeply impressed with the importance of the subject, Punch has in-
vented a new thermometer, which may be understood by the “people”
whom he addresses—the unlearned in caloric—the ignorant of the prin-
ciples of expansion and dilutation. Everybody can tell, without a thermo-
moter, if it be a coat colder or a cotton waistcoat warmer than usual when
he is out. But at home! Ah, there's the rub! There it has been impos-
sible to ascertain how to face the storm, or to turn one's back upon the
sunshine, till to-day. PUNCH's thermometer decides the question, and
here we give a diagram of it. Owing a stern and solemn duty to
the public, Punch has indignantly spurned the offers of the British
Association to join in their mummeries at \Plymouth -- to appear
at their dinners for the debasement of science. No; here in his own
pages, and in them only, doth he propound his invention. But he is
not exclusive; laving published his wonderful invention, he invites the
makers to copy his plan. Mr. Murphy is already busily arranging his

THE WHIGS' LAST DYING SPEECH, AS DELIVERED A NEW VERSION OF BELSHAZZAR'S FEAST.I
BY THE QUEEN.
It is with no common pride that Punch avails himself of the
opportunity presented to him, from sources exclusively his own,
of laying before his readers a copy of the original draft of the
Speech decided upon at a late Cabinet Council. There is a novelty
about it which pre-eminently distinguishes it from all preceding
orations from the throne or the woolsack, for it has a purpose,
and evinces much kind consideration on the part of the Sovereign,
in rendering this monody on departed Whiggism as grateful as
possible to its surviving friends and admirers.
There is much of the eulogistic fervour of George Robins, com-
bined with the rich poetic feeling of Mechi, running throughout
the oration. Indeed, it remained for the Whigs to add this crown-
ing triumph to their policy; for who but Melbourne and Co. would
have conceived the happy idea of converting the mouth of the
monarch into an organ for puffing, and transforming Majesty
itself into a National Advertiser.
THE QUEEN'S SPEECH
MY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN,
I have the satisfaction to inform you, that, through the invaluable
policy of my present talented and highly disinterested advisers, I continue
to receive from foreign powers assurances of their amicable disposition
towards, and unbounded respect for, my elegant and enlightened Secretary
of State for Foreign Affairs, and of their earnest desire to remain on terms
of friendship with the rest of my gifted, liberal, and amiable Cabinet.
The posture of affairs in China is certainly not of the most pacific cha-
racter, but I have the assurance of my infallible Privy Council, and of that
profound statesman my Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in particular,
that the present disagreement arises entirely from the barbarous character

in these journals, that millions of these desert tribes have no other
beverage than tea for their support. As their oath prohibits any
other liquor, they will be driven to water for subsistence, and,
unable to correct its unhealthy influence by doses of rhubarb, will
die miserably. In anticipation of this event, large catacombs are
being erected near their great city, on the authority of Slo-Lefe-
Tee, who visited it last year, and intends shortly to go there again.
The rhubarb prohibition will, it is said, have a great effect upon

tain as to the course to be pursued.
The emperor has issued a chop to the Hong merchants, for-

remain obstinate, to recommend his being pounded up with broken

An English flag, stolen by a deserter from Chusan, will be for-

But splendid as this is, Mr. Stephens can make the force of bathos go a

The idea of transferring the seat of imagination from the head to the
heart, and causing it to exhibit the wainscot in a pirouette, and the floor in
an ague, is highly Shakesperesque, and, as the Courier is made to say
at page 3 of the Opinions, " is worthy of the best days of that noble school
of dramatic literature in which Mr. Stephens has so successfully studied.”
This well-deserved praise—the success with which the author has studied,
in a school the models of which were human feelings and nature we
have yet to illustrate from other passages. Mr. Stephens evinces his full
acquaintance with Nature by a familiarity with her convulsions : whirlwinds,
thunder, lightning, earthquakes, and volcanoes-are this gentleman's play-
things. When, for instance, Rupert is going to be gallant to Queen Isa-
bella, she exclaims :-
“ Dire lightnings! Scoundrel! Help!”
Martinuzzi conveys a wish for his nobles to laugh-an order for a sort of
court cachinnation—in these pretty terms :-

THE MINISTRY'S ODE TO THE PASSIONS.
NOT BY COLLINS,
But as his fingers touch'd the purse's strings,
The chinking metal made a magic sound,
While hungry placemen gather'd fast around :
And he, as if by chance or play,
Or that he would their venal votes repay,
The golden treasures round upon them flings.
SIR ROBERT PEEL AND THE QUEEN.
UPON the first interview of the Queen with Sir Robert Peel, her Ma.
jesty was determined to answer only in monosyllables to all he said; and,
in fact, to make her replies an echo, and nothing more, to whatever he
said to her. The following dialogue, which we have thrown into verse for
the purpose of smoothing it--the tone of it, as spoken, having been on one
side, at least, rather rough-ensued between the illustrious persons al-
luded to
HE.-Before we into minor details go,
Do I possess your confidence or no ?
SHE.-No.
HE.-You shall not vex me, though your treatment's rough ;
No, madam, I am made of sterner stuff.
SHE.-Stuff.
HE.-Really, if thus your minister you flout,
A single syllable he can't get out.
She-Get out !
HE.-But try me, madam ; time indeed will show
Unto what lengths to serve you I would go.
SHE.-Go.
He.--We both have power,'tis doubtful which is greater ;
These crooked words had better be made straighter.
ShE.-Traighter (Traitor),
HE.-Farewell ! and never in this friendly strain,
(My proffer'd aid foregone) I breathe again!
SHE-Gone. I breathe again!
When the Whig Ministry had run,
Nor left behind a mother's son,
The Tories, at their leader's call,
Came thronging round him, one and all,
Exulting, braying, cringing, coaxing,
Expert at humbugging and hoaxing;
By turns they felt an honest zeal
For private good and public weal ;.
'Till all at once they raised such yells,
As rung in Apsley House the bells :
And as they sought snug berths to get
In Bobby Peel's new Cabinet,
Each, for interest rul'd the hour,
Would prove his taste for place and pow'r,
First, Follett's hand, his skill to try,
Upon the seals bewildered laid ;
But back recoiled-he scarce knew why
Of Lyndhurst's angry scowl afraid.
Next Stanley rushed with frenzied air ;
His eager haste brook'd no delay :
He rudely seized the Foreign chair,
And bade poor Cupid trudge away.
With woeful visage, Melbourne sate-
A pint of double X his grief beguild;
And inly pondering o'er his fate,
He bade th' attendant pot-boy“ draw it mild.”
But thou, Sir Jamie Graham-prig;
What was thy delighted musing?
Now accepting, now refusing,
Till on the Admiralty pitched,
Still would that thought his speech prolong;
To gain the place for which he long had itch'd,
He callid on Bobby still through all the song ;
But ever as his sweetest theme he chose,
A sovereign's golden chink was heard at every close,
And Pollock grimly smild, and shook his powder'd wig,
And longer had he droned—but, with a frown,
Brougham impatient rose :
He threw the bench of snoring bishops down,
And, with a withering look,
The Whig-denouncing trumpet took,
And made a speech so fierce and true,
Thrashing, with might and main, both friend and foe;
And ever and anon he beat,
With doubled fist, his cushioned seat;
And though sometimes, each breathless pause between,
Astonish'd Melbourne at his side,
His moderating voice applied,
Yet still he kept his stern, unalter'd mien,
While battering the Whigs and Tories black and blue.
Thy ravings, Goulbourn, to no theme were fix'd.
Not ev’n thy virtue is without its spots ;
With piety thy politics were mix'd,
And now they courted Peel, now call'd on Doctor Watts.
With drooping jaw, like one half screwd,
Lord Johnny sate in doleful mood,
And for his Secretarial seat,
Sent forth his howlings sad, but sweet.
Lost Normanby pour'd forth his sad adieu ;
While Palmerston, with graceful air,
Wildly toss'd his scented hair ;
And pensive Morpeth join'd the sniv'lling crew.
Yet still they linger'd round with fond delay,
Humming, hawing, stopping, musing,
Tory rascals all abusing,
Till forc'd to move away.
But, oh! how alter'd was the whining tone
When loud-tongued Lyndhurst, that unblushing wight,
His gown across his shoulders flung,
His wig with virgin powder white,
Made an ear-splitting speech that down to Windsor rung,
The Tories call, that Billy Holmes well knew,
The turn-coat Downshire and his Orange crew;
Wicklow and Howard both were seen
Brushing away the wee bit green ;
Mad Londonderry laughed to hear,
And Inglis scream'd and shook his ass's ear.
Last Bobby Peel, with hypocritic air,
He with modest look came sneaking ;
First to "the Home' his easy vows addrest,
But soon he saw the Treasury's red chair,
Whose soft inviting seat he loved the best.
They would have thought, who heard his words,
They saw in Britain's cause a patriot stand,
The proud defender of his land,
To aw'd and list'ning senates speaking ;-
SONGS OF THE SEEDY.-No. 2.
I CANNOT rove with thee, where zephyrs float-
Sweet sylvan scenes devoted to the loves ! -
For, oh! I have not got one decent coat,
Nor can I sport a single pair of gloves.
Gladly I'd wander o'er the verdant lawn,
Where graze contentedly the fleecy flock;
But can I show myself in gills so torn,
Or brave the public gaze in such a stock ?
I know thou'lt answer me that love is blind,
And faults in one it worships can't perceive;
It must be sightless, truly, not to find
The hole that's gaping in my threadbare sleeve.
Farewell, my love-for, oh! by heaven, we part,
And, though it cost me all the pangs of hell,
The herd shall not on thee inflict a smart,

OUT OF SEASON.
A LYRIC, BY THE LAST MAN-IN TOWN,
Chaos returns! no soul's in town!
And darkness reigns where lamps once brightened ;
Shutters are closed, and blinds drawn down-
Untrodden door-steps go unwhitened !
The echoes of some straggler's boots
Alone are on the pavement ringing;
While 'prentice boys, who smoke cheroots,
Stand critics to some broom-girl's singing.

Whose head might represent a fury.

correct card vendors, E. O, table-keepers, Mr. Jerry, and the toll-
takers on the road and the course. The original idea of these
coats was accidentally given by John Day, who was describing, on
Nugee's cutting-board, the exact curvature of Tattenham Corner.
The shooting-jacket should be designed after a dovecot or a
chest of drawers; and the great art in rendering this garment per-
fect, is to make the coat entirely of pockets, that part which covers

even a cigar case in that peculiar situation.
The surtout (not regulation) admits of very little design. It can
only be varied by the length of the skirts, which may be either as
long as a fireman's, or as short as Duvernay's petticoats. This
coat is, in fact, a cross between the dress and the driving, and
may, perhaps, be described as a Benjamin, junior.

The box-coat has, of late years, been denuded of its layers of

sight of an apparently organised band, wearing fustian coats, decorated
with curious brass badges, bearing exceedingly high numbers, who perched
themselves behind the Paddington ominibusses, and, in the most barefaced

daring violence, and wholesale arson, by shouting out, at the top of their
voices, “ O burn, the City, and the Bank.”

tedious work of filling a silken bag with gas was going on, so that the ap-

The process of inflation seemed to have but little effect on the balloon,
and it was not until about five o'clock that the important discovery was
made, that the gas introduced at the bottom had been escaping through a
hole in the top, and that the Equitable Company was laying it on excessively

incipient Turpins may com-

moderate charge of sixpence per week. The “intellectualization of the
people" must not be neglected : the gallery of the Victoria invites to
its instructive benches the young, whose wicked parents have neglected
their education—the ignorant, who know nothing of the science of high-
way robbery, or the more delicate operations of picking pockets. Na-
tional education is the sole aim of the sole lessee---money is no object;
but errand-boys and apprentices must take their Monday night's lessons,
even if they rob the till. By this means an endless chain of subjects will
be woven, of which the Victoria itself supplies the links; the “Newgate
Calendar” will never be exhausted, and the cause of morality and melo-
drama continue to run a triumphant career!
The leaf of the “ Newgate Calendar'' torn out last Monday for the de-
lectation and instruction of the Victoria audience, was the “ Life and
Death of James Dawson," a gentleman rebel, who was very properly
hanged in 1716.
The arrangement of incidents in this piece was evidently an appeal to
the ingenuity of the audience-our own penetration failed, however, in un-
ravelling the plot. There was a drunken, gaming, dissipated student of
St. John's, Cambridge-a friend in a slouched hat and an immense pair of
jack-boots, and a lady who delicately invites her lover (the liero) to a
private interview and a cold collation.” There is something about a five
hundred pound note and a gaming-table-a heavy throw on the dice, and a
heavier speech on the vices of gaming, by a likeness of the portrait of Dr.
Dilworth that adorns the spelling-books. The hero rushes off in a state of
distraction, and is followed by the jack-boots in pursuit ; the enormous
strides of which leave the pursued but little chance, though he has got a

EXPRESS FROM WINDSOR.
ROEBUCK DEFYING THE “THUNDERER."
ROEBUCK was seated in his great arm chair,
Looking as senatorial and wise
As a calf's head when taken in surprise ;
A half-munch'd muffin did his fingers bear-
An empty egg-shell proved his meal nigh o'er.
When, lo! there came a tapping at the door :
“Come in !” he cried,
And in another minute by his side
Stood John the footboy, with the morning paper,
Wet from the press. O'er Roebuck's cheek
There passed a momentary gleam of joy,
Which spoke, as plainly as a smile could speak,
“Your master's speech is in that paper, boy.'
He waved his hand--the footboy left the room-
Roebuck pour'd out a cup of Hyson bloom ;
And, having sipp'd the tea and sniff'd the vapour,
Spread out the Thunderer" before his eyes
When, to his great surprise,
He saw imprinted there, in black and white,
That he, The Roe-buck-He, whom all men knew,
Had been expressly born to set worlds right-
That he was nothing but a parvenu.
Jove ! was it possible they lack'd the knowledge he
Boasted a literary and scientific genealogy!
That he had had some ancestors before him-
(Beside the Pa who wed the Ma who bore him)
Men whom the world had slighted, it is true,
Because it never knew
The greatness of the genius which had lain,
Like unwrought ore, within each vasty brain;
And as a prejudice exists that those
Who never do disclose
The knowledge that they boast of, seldom have any,
Each of his learned ancestors had died,
By an ungrateful world belied,
And dubb’d a Zany.
That he should be
Denied a pedigree !
Appeared so monstrous in this land of freedom,
He instantly conceived the notion
To go down to the House and make a motion,
That all men had a right to those who breed 'em.
Last evening a most diabolical, and, it is to be regretted suc-
cessful, attempt, was made to kiss the Princess Royal. It appears
that the Royal Babe was taking an airing in the park, reclining
in the arms of her principal nurse, and accompanied by several
ladies of the court, who were amusing the noble infant by playing
rattles, when a man of ferocious appearance emerged from behind
some trees, walked deliberately up to the noble group, placed his
hands on the nurse, and bent his head over the Princess. The
Honourable Miss Stanley, guessing the ruffian's intention, ear-
nestly implored him to kiss her instead, in which request she
was backed by all the ladies present. He was not, however, to
be frustrated in the attempt, which no sooner had he accomplished,
than he hurried off amidst the suppressed screams of the ladies.
The Royal Infant was immediately carried to the palace, where
her heart-rending cries attracted the attention of her Majesty,
who, on hurrying to the child, and hearing the painful narration,
would, in the burst of her maternal affection, have kissed the
infant, had not Sir J. Clarke, who was fortunately present, pre-
vented her so doing.
Dr. Locock was sent for from town, who, immediately on his
arrival at Windsor, held a conference with Sir J. Clarke, and a
basin of pap was prepared by them, which being administered to
the Royal Infant, produced the most satisfactory results.
We are prohibited from stating the measures taken for the
detection of the ruffian, lest their disclosure should frustrate the
ends of justice.
* This circumstance alone must at once convince every unprejudiced
person of the utter falsity of the reports (promulgated by certain interested

order was issued the next day, forbidding the troops to catch or eat any

prudent to keep within the walls, as the Chinese are very expert at picking
up stragglers, whom they usually strangle. Beyond this we cannot complain
of our situation ; fowls are extremely abundant, but I have not seen any,
the inhabitants having carried them up the country along with their cattle

Chinese had not poisoned them. Notwithstanding these unavoidable pri-

streets of London, carrying at his back a good-sized box, inside which, and
peeping through a sort of port-hole, a pretty little girl of some two
years old exhibits her chubby face. Surmounting the box, a small model

Jack prides himself on his little Poll and his little ship, which he boasts are
the miniature counterparts of their lovely originals; and with these at his
back, trudges merrily along, trusting that Providence will help him to “ keep
a southerly wind out of the bread-bag." Jack's songs, as we have remarked,
all relate to the sea-he is a complete repository of Dibdin's choice old
ballads and fok’sl chaunts. “Tom Bowling," " Lovely Nan,” “ Poor

“ Rule Britannia," are amongst his favourite pieces, but the “ Bay of

Habils.—The habits of the opera-dancer vary according as we see him in
public or in private life. On the stage he is all spangles and activity ; off
the stage, seediness and decrepitude are his chief characteristics. It is
usual for him to enter upon his public career with a tremendous bound and
a hat and feathers. After standing upon one toe, he raises its fellow up
to a line with his nose, and turns round until the applause comes, even if

enter, and we know something dreadful is going to happen, for the farmer's
wife is gone out of the way on purpose not to interrupt. The villain draws
a knife and drags his sweetheart into an out-house, and then the wife comes
on to describe what is passing ; for the audiences of Sadler's Wells would
tear up the benches if they dared to murder out of sight, without being told
what is going on. Accordingly, we hear a scream, and the sister of the
screamer exclaims,-“Ah, horror! He draws the knife across her throat !

bloody knife, of course, next enters, grasped by the villain ; who, as usual,
remarks he is sorry for what has happened, but it can't be helped, and must
be made the best of. The woman having suddenly recovered, escapes into
an additional private box, or trunk, placed on the stage for that purpose ;
stating that she will see what is going on from between the cracks. The
villain then murders the child, and walks off with his hands in his pocket;
leaving, as is always the case, the fatal knife in a most conspicuous part of
the stage, which for some seconds it has all to itself. The farmer comes in,
takes up the knife, and falls down in a fit, just in time for the constables to
come in and to take him up for the murder. The wife jumps out of the

We have a faint recollection of a class of gentlemen who used to
attach an heterogeneal collection of massive seals and keys to one end
of a chain, and a small church-clock to the other. The chain then
formed a pendulum in front of their small-clothes, and the dignified
oscillation of the appendages was considered to distinguish the gentle-
man. They were also used as auxiliaries in argument; for whenever
an hiatus occurred in the discussion, the speaker, by having resort to
his watch-chain, could frequently confound his adversary by com-

brought to such perfection ? By a process not very prevalent amongst
English singers-practice the most constant, study the most unwea-
ried. Punch will bet a wager with any sporting dilettante that Miss
Kemble has sung more while learning her art, than many old stagers
while professing and practising it.
She seems, then,-as far as one may judge of that kind of perfec-
tion—a perfect mistress of her voice; she can do what she likes with
it ; she can sustain a note in any part of the soprano compass-swell,
diminish, and keep it exactly to the same pitch for an incredible space
of time. She can burst forth a torrent of sound expressive of our
strongest passions, without losing an atom of tone, and she can dimi-
nish it to a whisper, in solto voce, as distinct as it is thrilling and true
intonation.
Having obtained this vocal mastery, she has unfettered energies to
devote to her acting; which, in Norma, has all the elements of tragic
dignity—all the tenderness of natural feeling. In one word, Miss
Kemble is a mistress of every branch of her art; and we can now say,
what we have so seldom had an opportunity to boast of, that our Eng-
lish stage possesses a singer who is also an actress and musician !
The opera is excellently put upon the stage. Miss Kemble, or

upon the living subject, that we may shortly expect to witness a beautiful
tableau vivant of
pounded in the first act, are-quite selon les règles-allowed to simmer till
the end of the fourth, and to boil over in the fifth. Thus we have a tragedy
after the manner of those lively productions that flourisbed in the time of
Garrick ; when Young, Murphy, and Francklin were Melpomene's head-
cooks.
Modern innovation has, however, added a sprinkle of spice to the hashes
of the above-named school. This is most commonly thrown in, by giving
to the stock-villain a dash of humour or sarcasm, so as to bring out his
savagery in bolder relief. He is also invested with an unaccountable in-
fluence over the hero, who can on no account be made to see his bare and
open treachery till about the middle of the fifth act, when the dupe's eyes
must be opened in time for the catastrophe.
These improvements have been carefully introduced into the present old
new tragedy. Ugone Spinola is the presiding genius of Doria's woes ;
and dogs him about for the pleasure of making him miserable. He is a
finished epicure in revenge ; picking little tit-bits of it with the most
savage gout all through; but particularly towards the end of the play. This
taste was, it seems, first acquired in consequence of a feud that formerly
existed between Doria's family and his own, in which his side came off so
decidedly second-best, that he only remains of his race; all the rest having

JOE HUME'S FORTHCOMING WORK.
We have received the following note from an old and esteemed corre-
spondent, who, we are rejoiced to find, has returned from a tour in Switzer.
land, where he has been engaged in a prodigious work connected with the
statistics of that country.
DEAR Punch,
Reform Club-house.
Knowing the interest you take in anything relating to the advancement
of science, I beg to apprise you that I am about publishing a statistical
work, in which I have made it perfectly clear that an immense saving in the
article of ice alone might be made in England by importing that which lies
waste upon Mont Blanc. I have also calculated to a fraction the number
of pints of milk produced in the canton of Berne, distinguishing the quan-
tity used in the making of cheese from that which has been consumed in
the manufacture of butter--and specifying in every instance whether the
milk has been yielded by cows or goats. There will be also a valuable
appendix to the work, containing a correct list of all the inns on the road
between Frankfort and Geneva, with a copy of the bill of fare at each, and
the prices charged ; together with the colour of the postilion's jacket, the
age of the landlord and the weight of his wife, and the height in inches of
the cook and chambermaid. To which will be added, “Ten Minutes' Advice"

halfpenny puff in your admired publication, you will confer a favour on
Your sincere friend, Joe HUME.
But, when they two had settled all between
Themselves, and Te-pott thought that he had caught her,
He found how premature his hopes had been
Without the approbation of the daughter-
Who talk'd with voice so loud and wit so keen,
That he thought all his Mrs. T.s had taught her ;
And, finding he was in the way there rather,
He left her to be lectured by her father.
“ Pray, what were women made for " (so she said,
Though Heaven forbid I join such tender saying),
" If they to be accounted are as dead,
And strangled if they ever are caught straying?
Tis well to give us diamonds for the head,
And silken gauds for festival arraying ;
But where of dress or diamonds is the use
If we mayn't go and show them ? that's the deuce !"
The father answer'd, much as fathers do
In cases of like nature here in Britain,
Where fathers seldom let fortunes slip through
Their fingers, when they think that they can get one ;
He said a many things extremely true-
Proving that girls are fine things to be quit on,
And that, could she accommodate her views to it,
She would find marriage very nice when used to it.
Now, 'tis no task to talk a woman into
Love, or a dance, or into dressing fine-
No task, I've heard, to talk her into sin too ;
But, somehow, reason don't seem in her line.
And so Miss Hy-son, spite of kith and kin too,
Persisting such a husband to decline-
The eager mandarin issued a warrant,
And got her apprehended by her parent.
Thus the poor girl was caught, for there was no
Appeal against so wealthy lover's fiat :
She must e'en he a wife of his, and so
She yielded him her hand demure and quiet ;
For ladies seldom cry unless they know
There's somebody convenient to cry at-
And, though it is consoling, on reflection
Such fierce emotions ruin the complexion.
FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE.
THE ROMANCE OF A TEACUP.
SIP THE FIRST.
In England one man 's mated to one woman,
To spend their days in holy matrimony-
In fact, I have heard from one or two men,
That one wife in a house is one too many
But, be this as it may, in China no man
Who can afford it shuts himself to any
Fix'd number, but is variously encumber'd
With better halves, from twenty to a hundred.
These to provide for in a pleasant way,
And, maybe, to avoid their chat and worry,
He shuts up in a harem night and day-
With them contriving all his cares to bury-
A point of policy which, I should say,
Sweetens the dose to men about to marry;
For, though a wife's a charming thing enough,
Yet, like all other blessings, quantum suff.
So to my tale: Te-pott the Multifarious
Was, once upon a time, a mandarin
In personal appearance but precarious,
Being incorrigibly bald and thin
But then so rich, through jobs and pensions various,
Obtain'd by voting with the party “in,"
That he maintain'd, in grace and honour too,
Sixty-five years, and spouses fifty-two.
Fifty-two wives ! and still he went about
Peering below the maiden ladies' veils—
Indeed, it was said (but there hangs a doubt
Of scandal on such gossip-whisper'd tales),
He had a good one still to single out-
For all his wives had tongues, and some had nails
And still he hoped, though fifty-twice deferr'd,
To find an angel in his fifty-third.
In China, mind, and such outlandish places,
A gentleman who wishes to be wed
Looks round about among the pretty faces,
Nor for a moment doubts they may be had
For asking; and if any of them “ nay” says,
He has his remedy as soon as said
For, when the bridegrooms disapprove what they do,
They teach them manners with the bastinado.
Near Te-pott's palace lived an old Chinese-
About as poor a man as could be known
In lands where guardians leave them to their ease,
Nor pen the poor up in bastilles of stone:
He got a livelihood by picking teas;
And of possessions worldly had but one-
But one_the which, the reader must be told,
Was a fair daughter seventeen years old.
She was a lovely little girl, and one
To charm the wits of both the high and the low;
And Te-pott's ancient heart was lost and won
In less time than 'twould take my pen to tell how:
So, as he was quite an experienced son-
In-law, and, too, a very wily fellow,
To make Hy-son his friend was no hard matter, I
Ween, with that specific for parents-flattery. I
YESTERDAY Paddy Green honoured that great artist William Hogarth
Teniers Raphael Bunks, Esq., with a sitting for a likeness. The portrait,
which will doubtless be an admirable one, is stated to be destined to adorn
one of Mr. Catnach's ballads, namely, “ The Monks of Old ! " which Mr.
P. Green, in most obliging manner, has allowed to appear.
William Paul took a walk yesterday as far as Houndsditch, in company
with Jeremiah Donovan. A pair of left-off unmentionables is confidently
reported to be the cause of their visit in the far East."
The lady of Paddy Green, Esquire, on Wednesday last, with that
kindness which has always distinguished her, caused to be distributed a
platterful of trotter bones amongst the starving dogs of the neighbourhood.
From information exclusively our own, and for whose correctness we
would stake our hump, we learn that James Burke, the honoured member
of the P. R., was seen to walk home on the night of Tuesday last with
three fresh herrings on a twig. After supper, he consoled himself with a
pint of fourpenny ale.
Charles Mears yesterday took a ride in a Whitechapel omnibus. He
alighted at Aldgate Pump, at which he took a draught of water from the
ladie. He afterwards regaled on a couple of polonies and a penny loaf.
THE UNKINDEST CUT OF ALL.
Jones, the journeyman tailor who was charged before Sir Peter Laurie
with being drunk and disorderly in Fleet-street, escaped the penalty of his
frolic by an extraordinary whim of justice. The young schoeider, it appears,
sported a luxuriant crop of hair, the fashion of which not pleasing the fancy
of the city Rhadamanthus, he remitted the fine on condition that the
delinquent should instantly cut off the offending hairs. A barber being
sent for, the operation was instantly performed; and Sir Peter, with a
spirit of generosity only to be equalled by his cutting humour, actually put
his hand in his breeches-pocket and handed over to the official Figaro bis
fee of one shilling. The shorn tailor left the office protesting that Sir Peter
had not treated him handsomely, as he had only consented to sacrifice his
flowing locks, but that the Alderman had cabbaged his whiskers as well.

propose that a similar festival should take place for the relief of the dis-

THE LIMERICK MARES.
The borough of Limerick at present enjoys the singular advantage of
baving two civic heads to the city. The new mare, Martin Honan, Esq.,
after being duly elected, civilly requested the old mare, C. S. Vereker, Esq.,
to turn out; to which he as civilly replied that he would see hin blessed
first, and as he was himself the only genuine and original donkey, he was
resolved not to yield his place at the corporate manger to the new animal.
Thus matters remain at present, the old Mare resolutely refusing to take

HINTS ON POPPING THE QUESTION.
To the bashful, the hesitating, and the ignorant, the following hints may
prove useful.
If you call on the loved one," and observe that she blushes when you
approach, give her hand a gentle squeeze, and if she returns it, consider it
"all right”-get the parents out of the room, sit down on the sofa beside
the “ most adorable of her sex ”-talk of the joys of wedded life. If she
appears pleased, rise, seem excited, and at once ask her to say the im.
portant, the life-or-death-deciding, the suicide-or-happiness-settling ques-
tion. If she pulls out her cambric, be assured you are accepted. Call her
“My darling Fanny !"-"My own dear creature !”-and a few such like
names, and this completes the scene. Ask her to name the day, and fancy
yourself already in Heaven.
A good plan is to call on the “ object of your affections” in the forenoon
- propose a walk-mamma consents, in the hope you will declare your in-
tentions. Wander through the green fields—talk of " love in a cottage,”
-"requited attachment "-and “rural felicity." If a child happens to
pass, of course intimate your fondness for the dear little creatures-this
will be a splendid hit. If the coast is clear, down you must full on your
knee, right or left (there is no rule as to this), and swear never to rise until
she agrees to take you " for better and for worse.” If, however, the grass
is wet, and you have white ducks on, or if your unmentionables are tightly
made-of course you must pursue another plan-say, vow you will blow
your brains out, or swallow arsenic, or drown yourself, if she won't say
“ yes."
If you are at a ball, and your charmer is there, captivating all around her,
get her into a corner, and “pop the question.” Some delay until after
supper, but “ delays are dangerous "- Round-hand copy.
A young lady's “ tears," when accepting you, mean “ I am too happy to
speak.” The dumb show of staring into each other's faces, squeezing fin.
gers, and sighing, originated, we have reason to believe, with the ancient
Romans. It is much practised now-a-days-as saving breath, and being
more lover-like than talking.
We could give many more valuable hints, but Punch has something better
to do than to teach ninnies the art of amorifying.
“ Was ever maiden so abused as I am ?
Teazed into such a marriage-then to be
Dosed with my husband twenty times per diem,
With repetetur haustus after tea!
And, if he should die, what can I get by him ?
A jointure's nothing among fifty-three!
I'm meek enough--but this I can not bear-
I wish : I wish:-- I wish a girl might swear!"
In such a mood, she (stop! I'll mend my pen;
For now all our preliminaries are done,
And I am come unto the crisis, when
Her fate depends on a kind reader's pardon)-
Wandering forth beyond the ladies' ken,
She thought she spied a male face in the garden
She hasten'd thither-she was not mistaken,
For sure enough, a man was there a-raking.
A man complete he was who own'd the visage,
A man of thirty-three, or may-be longer-
So young, she could not well distinguish his age-
So old, she knew he had one day been younger.
Now thirty-three, although a very nice age,
Is not so nice as twenty, twenty-one, or
So; but of lovers when a lady 's caught one,
She seldom stops to stipulate what sort o' one.
Now, the first moment Hy-son saw the gardener-
A gardener, by his tools and dress she knew
She felt her bosom round her heart in a
A just as if her heart was breaking through;
And so she blush'd, and hoped that he would pardon her
Intruding on his grounds—" so nice they grew !
Such roses ! what a pink !—and then that peony ;
Might she die if she ever look'd to see any!".
The gardener offer'd her a budding rose :
She took it with a smile, and colour'd high ;
While, as she gave its fragrance to her nose,
He took the opportunity to sigh.
And Hy-son's cheek blush'd like the daylight's close !
She glanced around to see that pone were nigh,
Then sigh'd again and thought, “ Although a peasant,
His manners are refined, and really pleasant."
They stood each looking in the other's eyes,
Till Hy.son dropp'd her gaze, and then-good lack !
Love is a cunning chapman : smiles, and sighs,
And tears, the choicest treasures in his pack !
Still barters he such baubles for the prize,
Which all regret when lost, yet can't get back-
The heart-a useful matter in a bosom-
Though some folks won't believe it till they lose 'em.
Love can say much, yet not a word be spoken.
Straight, as a wasp careering staid to sip
The dewy rose she held, the gardener's token,
He, seizing on her hand, with hasty grip,
The stem sway'd earthward with its blossom, broken.
The gardener raised her hand unto his lip,
And kiss'd it-when a rough voice, hoarse with halloas,
Cried, “ Harkye' fellow! I'll permit no followers!"
SONGS FOR THE SENTIMENTAL.-No. 11.
THE ROMANCE OF A TEACUP.
SIP THE SECOND.
Now harems being very lonely places,
Hemm'd in with bolts and bars on every side,
The fifty-two who shared Te.pott's embraces
Were glad to see a stranger, though a bride-
And so received her with their gentlest graces,
And questions—though the questions are implied,
For ladies, from Great Britain to the Tropics,
Are very orthodex in their choice of topics.
They ask'd her, who was married ? who was dead?
What were the newest things in silks and ivories ?
And had Y-Y-, who had eloped with 2-,
Been yet forgiven ? and had she seen his liveries ?
And weren't they something between grey and red ?
And hadn't Z's papa refused to give her his ?
So Hy-son told them everything she knew
And all was very well a day or two.
But, when the Multifarious forsook
Bo-hea, Pe-koe, and Wiry-leafʼd Gun-pow-der,
To revel in the lip and sunny look
Of the young stranger ; spite of all they'd vow'd her,
The ladies each with jealous anger shook,
And rail'd against the simple maid aloud - Ah!
This woman's pride is a fine thing to tell us of
But a small matter serves her to be jealous of.
One said she was indecorously florid-
One thought “ she only squinted, nothing more"
A third, convulsively pronounced her“ horrid "-
While Bo-hea, who was low (at four-and-four),
Glanced from her fingers up at Hy-son's forehead,
Who, inkling such a tendency before,
Cared for no rival's nails_but paid- I own,
Particular attention to her own.
Well, this was bad enough ; but worse than this
Were the attentions of our ancient hero,
Whose frequent vow, and frequenter caress,
Unwelcome were for any one to hear, who
Had charms for better pleasure than a kiss
From feeble dotard ten degrees from zero.
So, as one does when circumstances harass one,
Hy-son began to draw up a comparison.
The lists were made-the trumpet's blast
Rang pealing through the air,
My 'squire made lace and rivet fast
And brought my tried destrcrre.
I rode where sat fair Isidore
Inez Mathilde Borghese ;
From spur to crest she scann'd me o'er,
Then said “ He's not the cheese!"
0, Mary mother! how burn'd my cheek !
I proudly rode away;
And vow'd' Woe's his! who dares to break
A lance with me to-day!”.
I won the prize! (Revenge is sweet,
· I thought me of a ruse ;)
I laid it at her rival's feet,
And thus I cook'd her goose.

So much for construction : now for detail. The legitimate object of
comedy is the truthful delineation of manners. In life, manners are dis-
played by what people do, and by what they say. Comedy, therefore,
ought to consist of action and dialogue. (" Thank you,” exclaims our
reader, “for this wonderful discovery!") Now we have seen that in
“ Court and City" there is little action : hence it may be supposed
that the brilliancy of the dialogue it was that tempted the author to
brush away the well-deserved dust under which the “ Discovery" and the

“ Court and City" presents as pure a delineation of manners as a play
without incident can do-a truer one, perbaps, than if it were studded with
brilliancies ; for in private life neither the denizens of St. James's, nor those
of St. Botolph's, were ever celebrated for the brilliancy of their wit. Nor
are they at present; if we may judge from the fact of Colonel Sibthorp being
the representative of the one class, and Sir Peter Laurie the oracle of
the other.
This nice adaptation of the dialogue to the various characters, therefore,
offers scope for good acting, and gets it. Mr. Farren, in Sir Paladin
Scruple, affords what tradition and social history assure us is a perfect
portraiture of an old gentleman of the last century ;-more than that, of a
singular, peculiar old gentleman. And yet this excellent artist, in portraying
the peculiarities of the individual, still preserves the general features of the
class. The part itself is the most difficult in nature to make tolerable on
the stage, its leading characteristic being wordiness. Sir Paladin, a

OUR CITY ARTICLE.
An alarming forgery of Mendicity Society's tickets has been discovered
in Red Lion Square, and has caused much conversation at the doors of
most of the gin palaces. Our readers are probably aware what these tickets
are, though, being a particular class of security, there is not a great deal
publicly done in them. They are issued to certain subscribers, who pay a
guinea per year towards housing a Secretary and some other officers in a
moderate-sized house, in the kitchen of which certain soup is prepared,
which is partaken of by a number of persons called the Board, who are
said to taste it and see that it is good ; and if there is any left, which may
occasionally happen, the poor are allowed to finish it. This valuable pri-
vilege is secured by tickets ; and these tickets are found to be forged to a
very large amount-some say indeed to the amount of 14,000 basins. It
is not usual to pay off these soup tickets, but a sort of interest can be had
upon them by standing just over the railings of the house in Red Lion
Square, when the Secretary's dinner is being cooked or served up, and a
certain amount of savoury steam is then put into circulation. The house
has been besieged all day with “innocent bolders," who, on giving their
tickets in, cannot get them back again. The genuine tickets are known
by the stamp, which is a soup plate rampant, and a spoon argent,--the
latter being the emblem of the subscribers.
A great deal is said of a new company, whose object is'to take advantage
of a well-known fact in chemistry. It is known that diamonds can be re-
solved into charcoal, as well as that charcoal can be ultimately reduced to
air ; and a company is to be founded with the view of simply reversing the
process. Instead of getting air from diamonds, their object will be to get
diamonds from air ; and in fact the chief promoters of it have generally
drawn from that source the greater part of their capital. The whole sum
for shares need not be paid up at once; but the Directors will be satisfied
in the first instance with 10 per cent. on the whole sum to be raised from
the adventurers. It is intended to declare a dividend at the earliest possible
period, which will be directly the first diamond has been made by the new
process.
The women are best judges after all !
And Sheridan was right, and Plagi-ary;
To their decision all things mundane fall,
From court to counting-house ; from square to dairy ;
From caps to chemistry ; from tract to shawl;
And then these female verdicts dever vary!
In fact, on lap-dogs, lovers, buhl, and boddices,
There are no critics like these mortal goddesses !
To please such readers, authors make it answer
To trace a pedigree to the creation
Of some old Saxon peer ; a monstrous grandsire,
Whose battles tell, in print, to admiration-
But I, unfortunate, have never once a
Mysterious hint of any great relation ;
I know whether Shem or Japhet-right sir-
Was my progenitor-nor care a kreutzer.
For, though there's matter for regret in losing
An opportune occasion to record
The feats in gambling, duelling, seducing-
Conventional acquirements of a lord-
Still I have stories startling and amusing,
Which I can tell and vouch, upon my word,
To anybody who desires to hear 'em-
But don't be nervous, pray,-you needn't fear 'em.
CON. BY SIBTHORP AND STULTZ.
Why are batteries and soldiers like the hands and {feet of tailors ?--
Because the former make breaches (breeches), and the latter pass through
them.
But what of my poor Hy-son all this while ?
She saved the gardener by a timely kiss.
Few husbands are there proof against a smile,
And Te-pott's rage endured no more than this.
Ah, reader! gentle, moral, free from guile,
Think you she did so very much amiss ?
She was not love-sick for the fellow quite-
She merely thought of him—from morn till night :
A state of mind how much by parents dreaded !
(By those outrageous parents, English mammas,
Who scarcely own their daughters till they're wedded)
How postulant of patent Chubbs and Bramahs !
And eyes-the safest locks when locks are needed !-
And Abigails, and homilies, and grammars ;
And other antidotes for “ detrimentals
Id est, fine gentlemen unblest with rentals.
But this could not stop bere ; nor did it stop,
For both were anxious for--an explanation.
And in the harem's grating was a gap,
Whence Hy-son peep'd in modest hesitation ;
While on his spade the gardener would prop
Himself, and issue looks of adoration;
Until it happen'd, like a lucky rhyme,
Each for the other look'd at the same time.
Then fell the gardener upon his knees,
And kiss'd his hand in manner most devout-
So Hy-son couldn't find the heart to tease
The poor dear man by being in a pout ;-
Besides, she might go walk among the trees,
And not a word of scandal be made out.
She thought a-very-little more upon it,
Then smiled to Sou-chong,--and put on her bonnet.
THE ROMANCE OF A TEACUP.
SIP THE THIRD. GOS-SIP.
That hour devoted to thy vesper “service"-
Dulcet exhilaration ! glorious tea !-
I deem my happiest. Howsoe'er I swerve, as
To mind or morals, elsewhere, over thee
I am a perfect creature, quite impervious
To care, or tribulation, or ennui-
In fact, I do agnize to thee an utter
Devotion even to the bread and butter.
The homely kettle hissing on the bar-
(Urns I detest, irrelevant pomposities)
The world beyond the window-blinds, as far
As I can thrust it-this defines what " cosset" is-
What woe that rhyme such scene of bliss must mar !
But rhyme, alas! is one of my atrocities;
In common with those bards who have the scratch
Of writing, and are all right with Catnach.
" How Nancy Sniggles was the village pride,
How Will, her sweetheart, went to be a sailor; ?
How much at parting Nancy Sniggles cried,
And how she snubb'd her funny friend the tailor;
How William boldly fought and bravely died;
How Nancy Spiggles felt her senses fail her_"
Then comes a sad dénouement-now-a-days
It is not virtue dominant that pays.
Such tales, in this, the post-octavo age,
Our novelists incontinently tells us-
Tales, wherein lovely heroines engage
With highwaymen, good-looking rogues but callous,
Who go on swimmingly till the last page,
And then take poison to escape the gallows-
Tales, whose original refinement teaches
The pride of eloquence in-dying speeches !
What an apotheosis have we here !
What equal laws th' awards of fame dispose !
Capture a fort-assassinate a peer-
Alike be chronicled in startling prose-
Alike be dramatised-(how near
Is clever crime to virtue !)-at Tussaud's

From burglar Sheppard unto fiend Laffarge!
PUNCH AND THE SWISS GIANTESS!!
SHERIFFS' COURT.-WEDNESDAY.
BONBON versus PUNCH.
[This important cause came on for trial on Wednesday last. That it has
not been reported in the morning papers is doubtless to be attributed to
the most reckless bribery on the part of the plaintiff. He has, no doubt,
sought to hush up his infamy; the defendant has no such contemptible
cowardice. Hence a special reporter was engaged for Punch. The trial is
given here, firstly, for the beautiful illustration it affords of the philosophy
of the English law of crim. con.; and secondly on a principle-for Punch
has principles laid down by the defendant in his course of public life, to
show himself to the world the man he really is. In pursuit of this moral
and philosophical object, should the waywardness of his genius ever induce
Punch to cut a throat, pick a pocket, or, as a Middlesex magistrate
(for Punch bas been upon the bench many a year), to offer for sale a
tempting lot of liberty to any competent captive, should Punch rob as a
vulgar Old Bailey delinquent, or genteelly swindle as an Aldermanic share-
holder,-in each and every of these cases there will, on discovery, be the
fullest report of the same in Punch's own paper, Punch being deeply

SIBTHORP'S CORNER.
I LOVE the night with its mantle dark,
That hangs like a cloak on the face of the sky;
Oh what to me is the song of the lark ?
Give me the owl; and I'll tell you why.
It is that at night I can walk abroad,

Which I may not do in the garish day,
Without being met in the streets, and bored
By some cursed dun, that I cannot pay.
No! no ! night let it ever be :
The owl! the owl! the owll is the bird for me!
Then tempt me not with thy soft guitar,
And thy voice like the sound of a silver bell,
To take a stroll, where the cold ones are
Who in lanes, not of trees but of fetters, dwell.
But wait until night upsets its ink
On the earth, on the sea, and all over the sky,
And then I'll go to the wide world's brink
With the girl I love, without feeling shy.
Oh, then, may it night for ever be !
The owl! the owl! the owl! is the bird for me!
But you turn aside! Ah ! did you know,
What by searching the office you'd plainly see,
That I'm hunted down, like a (Richard) Roe,
You'd not thus avert your eyes from me.

ENTLE WOMAN!- Beautiful enigma!

cate the following pages. The subject on
which I am about to treat is the gravest, the
lightest, the most decided, the most undefined,
the most earthly, the most spiritual, the saddest,
and the gayest, the most individual, and at the
same time the most universal you can imagine.
To you, ladies, I address myself. You who

I may best touch the chords of your hearts ? Come around me, ye earthly
divinities of every age, rank, and imaginable variety! Buds of blushing
sixteen, full-blown roses of thirty, haughty court dames, and smiling city
beauties, come like delicious phantoms, and fill my mind with images
graceful as your own forms, and melting as your own hearts! Thanks,
gentle spirits ! ye have heard my call, and now, inspired by you, I seize my
pen, and give to my paper the thoughts which crowd upon my mind.
WHAT IS LOVE?
It is easier to answer this question by a thousand instances, than by one-
definition, which can comprehend them all. What is Love? It is anything
you please. It is a prism, through which the eye beholds the same object
in various colours ; it is a heaven of bliss, or a hell of torture; a thirst of
the heart-an appetite which we spiritualize; a pure expansion of the soul,
but which sooner or later becomes metamorphosed into an animal passion
--a diamond statue with feet of clay. It is a dream-a delirium, a desire
for danger, and a hope of conquest; it is that which everyone abjures, and
everyone covets ; it is the end, the great end, and the only end of life. Love,
in short, is a tyrannical influence which none can escape ; and however
metaphysicians may define the passion, it appears to me that it is wholly
dependent on the mysterious

And still perchance thy faithful heart
May pine, and break, when I am gone !
While bitter tears, unbidden, start,

Paris, Passage de l'Opéra, Escalier B. au 3ème.
My dear Punch,
I salute you with reverence-I embrace you with affection-I thank
you with devout gratitude, for the many delightful moments I have enjoyed
in your society. I regularly read your “ London Charivari : ” it is magnifi-
cent-superb! What wit-what agacerie—what exquisite badinage is con-
tained in every line of it! You are the veritable monarch of English
humour. Hail, then, great fun-ambule, Punch THE FIRST! Long may
you live, to flourish your invincible baton, and to increase the number of
your laughing subjects. Your “ Physiology of the Medical Student” has
been translated, and the avidity with which it is read here has suggested to
me the idea that sketches of French character might be equally popular
amongst English readers. With this hope I send you the commencement
of a Physiological and Pictorial Portrait of “ The Lover." I have chosen
him for my leading character, because his madness will be understood by
the whole world. Love, mon cher ami, is not a local passion, it grows
everywhere like-but I am anticipating my subject, which I now commit
to your hands,
With sentiments of the profoundest respect and esteem,
ALPHONSE LECOURT.

WA
WAT in
LAWS OF ATTRACTION.
A FEW WORDS ABOUT YOUNG LADIES.
A young lady, I mean one who has but recently thrown aside her dolls, is
a bashful blushing little puppet, who only acts, speaks, and moves as mama
directs. She is a statue of flesh and blood, not yet animated by the Pro-
methean fire—a chrysalis, which may one day become a beautiful butterfly,
fluttering on silken wing amidst a crowd of adorers; but she is yet only a
chrysalis, pale and cold, and wrapped up in a thousand conventional restric-
tions, like a mummy in its swatbes.
The very young lady is usually prodigiously careful of her little self: she
regards men as her natural enemies. Poor innocent !- This absurdity is the
fault of her education. They have made her believe that love is the most
abominable, execrable, infernal thing in existence. They have taught her
to lie and to dissimulate her most innocent emotions. But the time is not
far distant when the natural impulses of her heart will break down the
barriers that hypocrisy has placed around her. Woman was formed to love :
she must obey the imperious law of her being, and will love the moment
her inspirations for the belle passion become stronger than her reason.
I may add, also, that when a young lady discovers a tendency this way, it
may be safely conjectured the object on which she will bestow her favour is
not very distant.

WITNESS MY
MEDITATION IN LONDON.
You can order, if you please, a cup of coffee without anything to it ; and,
for so doing, you may sit if you wish for five or six hours in succession.
I have said that coffee-houses are excellent places for reading; I might
have added, for meditation also. For unlike public-houses, there are no
noisy discussions and disputes in them. All is calm, tranquil, and com-
fortable. The beverage, too, which is drank as a beverage, as I before re-
marked in a previous chapter, cheers, but not inebriates.
The remarks are generally equally original, and the facts, no doubt in
some degree truths, are all alike humorous ; the more so when the aspect
of the book and the names of the respectable publishers suggest the higher
class of readers to whom it is addressed. Little anecdotes are interspersed,
concerning Harriet, of Coventry-street, who didn't mind her stops ; and
James, behind the Mansion-house, who knew everybody's appetite, that
enliven the descriptive portions of the work, which is in its very inappro-
priateness the more amusing, and cannot be read without reaping both in-
formation and instruction on topics which no other author would have had
the temerity to discuss.
But these are only words. Let Punch, the rival of this Caledo-
nian Asmodeus, do justice to the man whose " character is stamped
on every page (of his own), who yet is above pity; poor, yet full of
enjoyment; humble, yet glorious ; ignorant, yet confident."

But Apollo himself could not charm away the rich fun that pervades the
English adaptation ; nor the modest humour of its preface. It has been,
hitherto, one characteristic of the lyric drama to consist of verse ; rbyme
has been thought not wholly dispensable. Those, however, who are
“ familiar with the writings of Ossian," (and the works of the Covent.
Garden adapter), will, according to the preface, at once see the fallacy of
this. Rhyme is mere "jingle,”-rhythm, rbodomontade,-metre, monstrous,
-versification, villanous,-in short, Ossian did not write poetry, neither
does this learned prefacier-so it's all nonsense!
To burlesque such a work as “ Norma," then, is to paint the lily, to gild re-
fined gold, to caricature Lord Morpeth, or to attempt to improve Punch. Yet
the opportunity was too tempting to be wholly overlooked, and a bint baring

upon it. An enlarged edition of the work may, therefore, now be had at
half-price. A heroine of six foot two or three in her sandals, with a bass
voice, covers the stage with tremendous strides, and warbles out "her wood-
notes" (being a Druidess she worsbips the oak) “wild," with a volume of
voice which silences the trombone, and makes the opbecleide sound asth-
matic. In short, the great feature is Mr. Paul Bedford. The children he
brings forward are worthy of their parentage. Pollio is made a most killing
Roman roué by Mrs. Grattan ; but Norma's attendant does not speak
Irish half so richly as the Covent Garden Flavius.
But, above all, commend we Mr. Wright's Adelgeisa. It is a master-
piece ; all the airs and graces of the prima donna be imitates with a true
spirit of burlesque. As to his singing, it astonished everybody, and so did

THE CHEROOT.
A CUT BY SIR PETER.
An excellent thing it is, when you get it genuine-none of your
coarse Whitechapel abominations, but a veritable satin-skinned, brown
Indian beauty ; smooth and firm to the touch, and full-flavoured to the
taste ; such a one as would be worth a Jewess' eye, with a glass of
tawny Port. But the gratification that we have been wont to derive
from our real Manilla has been sadly disturbed of late by a circumstance
which has caused a dreadful schism in the smoking world, and has
agitated every divan in the metropolis to its very centre. The ques-
tion is, “ Whether should a cheroot be smoked by the great or the
small end?” On this apparently trivial subject the great body of
cheroot smokers have taken different sides, and divided themselves, as
the Lilliputians did in the famous egg controversy, into the Big-endians
and Little-endians. The dispute has been carried on with great vigour on
both sides, and several ingenious volumes have been already written,
proving satisfactorily the superiority of each system, without however
convincing a single individual of the opposite party. The Tories, we
have observed, have as usual seized on the big end of the argument,
while the Whigs have grappled as resolutely by the little end, and
are puffing away furiously in each other's eyes. Heaven knows where
the contest will end! For ourselves, we are content to watch the
struggle from our quiet corner, convinced, whichever end gains the
victory, that John Bull will be made to smoke for it; and when curious
people ask us if we be big-endians or little-endians, we answer, that, to
oblige all our friends, we smoke our Manillas at both ends.

Tomkins, you're dish'd! thy light luxuriant hair,
Like “a distress," hath left thy caput bare ;
Thy temples mourn th' umbrageous locks, and yield
A crop as stunted as a stubble field.
Rowland and Ross ! your greasy gifts are vain,
You give the hair you're sure to cut again.
Unhappy Tomkins ! late thy ringlets rare,
E'en Wombwell's self to rival might despair.
Now with thy smooth crown, nor the fledgling's chops,
Nor East-born Mechi's magic razor strops,
Can vie! And laughing maids you fly in dread,
Lest they should see the horrors of your head !
Laurie, like death, hath clouded o'er your morn.
Tomkins, you're dish'd! Your Jeune France locks are shorn.

PUNCH'S POSTSCRIPT.
MR. AUGUSTUS SWIVEL, (Professor of the Drum and Mouth-organ, and Stage-Manager to Punch's Theatre,)
LOQUITUR.
ATRONS OF “ PUNCH,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
WE has dropped the curtain and rowled up the baize on the first
half-annivel performance of “Punch." The pleasing task now dewolves upon me, on
behoof of the Lessee and the whole strength off the Puppets, to come forrard and
acknowledge the liberal showers of applause and 'apence what a generous and
enlightened British public has powered upon the performances and pitched into our
goss. Steamilated by this St. Swiffin's of success, the Lessee fearlessly launches his
bark upon the high road of public favor, and enters his Theaytre for the grand
steeple-chase of general approbation.
Ourn hasn't been a bed of roses. We've had our rivals and our troubles. We came out as a great hint, and
everybody took us.
First and foremost, the great Juggeler in Printing-house Square, walks in like the Sheriff and takes our
comic effects.

PUNCH'S POSTSCRIPT.
Then the Black Doctor, as blowed the bellows to the late ministerial organ, starts a fantoccini and collars
our dialect.
Then, the unhappy wight what acts as dry-nuss to his Grandmother, finding his writing on the pavement with
red and white chalk and sentiment, won't friz,-gives over appealing to the sympathies, kidnaps our comic offspring,
and (as our brother dramatist Muster Sheridan says) disfigures 'em to make 'em look like his own.
Then, the whole biling of our other hoppositioners who puts their shoulders together, to “hoist up a
donkey,” tries to ornament their werry wulgar exhibitions with our vitticisms.
Now this was cruel, deceitful condick on the part of the juggeler,-a side wind blow from the organ,-didn't
show much of the milk of human kindness with the chalk; and as for the ass, but no,-brotherly love is our
weakness, and we throws a veil over the donkey.
During the recess the exterior of the Theaytre will be re-decorated by Muster Phiz; and the first artists in
pen, ink, black-lead, and box-wood, has been secured to see if any improvements can be made in the interior.
I have the honor to inform you that we shall commence our next campaign on January 1, 1842, with renewed
henergy, all the old-established wooden heads, and several new hands.
And now, Ladies and Gentlemen, on behalf of “ Punch,” the Puppets, the Properrieters, and the Orchestra
(which is myself), I most respectfully touches my hat, and wishes you all a merry Christmas and a happy New
Year. Au rewoir.
