§ëand herewith enriches the world with his Tenth Volume. Writing, as he does, with the
quill of an Eagle, which, sympathising with its living parent, continually renews its youth; for it
is a “great fact” that PUNCH's quill, cut to the very stump at night, is whole again by the morning; it
is not for him to guess, even within a few hundreds, the number of Volumes that Time, his shopman and
publisher, will yet distribute to the Universe. All, prophet-like, he knows is—this: so long as English
Midsummer and English Christmas endure, so long will a new Tome of Punch impart a sweetness and a
beauty to the rose of June; endow with brighter greenness the holly of December. Great news this, for
the present generation. Happy tidings for a yet unborn world ! And while our heart expands with this
conviction of typographic Immortality; whilst PUNCH, pitying the ousted mummies of Egyptian Kings,
sees himself embalmed in decency for ever in printers' ink; he can afford to be compassionate of the few
(the silly few ' ) who now and then are pleased to croak at him. Small frogs are they ; noisiest, too, in
dirtiest pools. But as no croaking, be it ever so vehement, can turn the silver moon into a copper
pocket-piece, so cannot little frogs in the dregs of ink-bottles bring a shadow on the shining countenance
of PUNCH. No: croak as they will, his only revenge shall be to wish them nightingales.

iy PREFACE.
PUNCH has had his Midsummer Night's Dream. Sitting in his honeysuckle bower, his body drinking at
every pore, as a sponge would drink honey-dew, the blessed, balm of the season, he had a sort of vision; fell
into that state of dreaminess when the soul sees earth in a new garment of beauty, and hears sweet new music,
as from a far-off world. And then PUNCH saw trees, bowing with golden fruits; and flowers, such as
only grow in the world of dreams. And the fruits became pictured, as though every fruit bore a cut; and
in the million, million flowers grew syllables and words—(not woful words, that stain the classic hyacinth)—
and from the cells of cup-moss, and half-unfolded buds, leapt a myriad of things—faithful likenesses, as our
spirit then imparted to us, of kings, and queens, and lords, and law-makers, and little bullies, and great
simpletons, all to people this world, in its spinning course, for the next handful of centuries, and all to
make up the engraven pictures and the picture-writing of the future Pusch.
And this was a dream, “but was not all a dream.” Punch feels that his leaves will be
multitudinous as the leaves of the roses of old Bagdad; and although in the course of time it will
indubitably be necessary to build a new wing or two to the British Museum, to contain the many-
volumed Punch, in his published bulk, that the hard students of life, the minute philosophers of the
human heart, may patiently study every letter of him, yet can Punch, lifting the curtain of the year
2000, see his leaves of centuries—like the roses of the East—submitted to the chemist, that his essence
may be extracted, as a most enriching gift for the great and virtuous—or rather for the virtuous, for
in that time virtue only will be greatness. The attar of Punch is—Punch knows it—destined to save
and sweeten Mr. CARLYLE's “decadent generations; ” to arrest them, by sweet intoxication, in their
railway speed to “final perdition.”
When a Hero is to be born, some tremendous event always foreruns the call of the midwife. And
thus it is—and very properly—with the birth of every Volume of Punch. Corn-Law is dead—is a “clod
of the valley.” Already predictions of large-brained lords are about to be fulfilled. The joyous, jocund
Peasantry of Suffolk—Richmond's own—are losing their native Doric, and (fast becoming like unto Polish
serfs) already swear in pure Sclavonic All landowners—save those who grow their own mighionette at
their windows–are ruined. Pockets worn inside out will speedily be the only fashion for a country
gentleman. The social evil would be tremendous, but—
BUT-PUNCH publishes his Tenth Volume. And a Richmond is reconciled to Britain; and, with a
full belief in other volumes, a Buckingham wanly smiles, and more than half consents to live and die in
desolate England

SONG OF JANUARY.
(arrºn run roºf auxx.)
When other months amid the range
Of Time's revolving year,
Exhibit symptoms of a change
From what they should appear ;
Though April fails to bring her showers;
Though March is mild and tame;
Though May forgets her buds and flowers,
You'll find me still the same.
They say that Janussways my lot,
That I two faces wear;
But, let me ask them, who does not?
In this false-world of care.
Oh! I'm amonth that’s always cold,
And who shall dare to blame,
If they're at such a moment told
That I am still the same.

MR. CAUDLE’S BREAKFAST TALK.
CHAPTER L-HOW MR. CAUDLE MARRIED MISS PRETTYMAN, AND HOW HE “NAGGED" HER TO DEATH.
When HARRY PastºryMan saw the very superb funeral of Mas. Carole
-Parrryman attended as mourner, and was particularly jolly in the coach
—he observed that the disconsolate widower showed that above all men he
knew how to make the best of a bad bargain. The remark, as the dear
deceased would have said, was unmanly, brutal; but quite like that Paer-
Tyman. The same scoffer, when Caudie declared “he should never cease
to weep,” replied, “He was very sorry to hearit; for it must raise the price
of onions.” It was not enough to help to breakthe heart of a wife; no; the
*: must joke over its precious pieces.
a funeral, we repeat, was remarkably handsome: in Paerryman's
words, nothing could be more satisfactory." Cauple spoke of a monument.
Whereupon: Pastryman suggested “Death gathering a Nettle.” caudiºs
-theast did equal honour to his brain and his bosom-rejected it.
Mr. Caubus, attended by many of his friends, returned to his widowed
home in tolerable spirits. Paerry MAN said, jocosely poking his two fingers
in Cavolºs, ribs, that in a week he'd look “quite a tulip.” Cauble
merely replied—he could hardly hope it.
Pherryman's mirth, however, communicated itself to the company; and was cauple's second wife. Mrs. Cauple, number two. Poor thing!

in a very little time the meeting took the air of a very pleasant party. Some-
how, Miss PRErryman presided at the tea-table. There was in hermanner
a charming mixture of grace, dignity, and confidence—a beautiful black
swan. Pºerry MAN, by the way, whispered to a friend that there was just
this difference between Mrs. Caudle and his sister—“Mrs. Caudie was a
great goose, whereas SARAH was a little duck.” . We will not swear that
CAUDLE did not overhear the words; for as he resignedly stirred his tea, he
looked at the lady at the head of the table, smiled, and sighed.
It was odd; but women are so apt Miss Pºetryman seemed as familiar
with Caupº's silver tea-pot, as with her own silver thimble. With a smile
upon her face—like the butter on the muffins—she handed CAUDLE his tea-
cup. Cauple would, now and then, abstractedly cast his eye above the
mantel-piece. There was Mas. CApple's portrait...Whereupon, Miss
PRErryman would say, “You must take comfort, Mr. Caudiº, indeed
you must.” At length Mr. Cauple replied, “I will, Miss PRErryman.”
what then passed through Cauple's brain we know not; but this we
know: in a twelvemonth and a week from that day, Sanah Pºwas

There is a cheerful hooting from the owl,
The common hen sits happy on her nest,
The ringdove coos, the crow forgets to scrowl,

|The world has fossilised my heart to stone,

ried four weeks—I don't exactly see what you have to sigh about—and yet
you can't make me a proper cup of tea. However, I don't know how I
should expect it. There never was but one woman who could make tea to
my taste, and she is now in Heaven. Now, Mrs. Caudle, let me hear no
crying. I'm not one of the people to be melted by the tears of a woman;
for you can all cry—all of you—at a minute's notice. The water's always
laid on, and down it comes if a man only holds up his finger.
* Fou didn't think I could be so brutal? That's it. Let a man only
speak, and he's brutal. It's a woman's first duty to make a decent cup of
tea. What do you think I married you for? It's all very well with your
tambour-work and such trumpery. You can make butterflies on kettle-
holders; but can you make a pudding, ma'am! I'll be bound not.
“Of course, as usual; you've given me the corner-roll; because you
know I hate a corner-roll. I did think you must have seen that. I did
hope I should not be obliged to speak on so paltry a subject—but it's no use
to hope to be mild with you. I see that's hopeless.
“And what a herring! And you call it a bloater, suppose? Ha! there
was a woman who had an eye for a bloater, but—sainted creature!—she's
here no longer. You wish she was? Oh, I understand that. I'm sure if
anybody should wish herbackit's—but she was too good for me. “When I'm

And now I do know it.
“Here's the eggs boiled to a stone again! Do you think, Mas. Cauple,
I'm a canary-bird, to be fed upon hard eggs? Don't tell me about the
servant. A wife is answerable to her husband for her servants. It's her
business to hire proper people: if she doesn't, she's not fit to be a wife.
I find the money, Mrs. Caudie, and I expect you to find the cookery.
“There you are with your pocket-handkerchief again: the old flag of
truce; but it doesn't trick me. A pretty honey-moon? Honey-moon, non-

ings—I find it now—that we can't have twice in our existence. There's
no making honey a second time.
“No ; I think I've put up with your neglect long enough: and there's
nothing like beginning as we intend to go on. Therefore, MRs. Caudle, if
my tea isn't made a little more to my liking to-morrow—and if you insult
me with a herring like that—and boil my eggs that you might fire’em out of
guns—why, perhaps, Mas. Caudiº, you may see a man in a passion. It

CHAP. IV.-SHOWING. HOW CAUDLE, HAVING LOST MONEY AT CARDS, DETERMINES TO ABRIDGE THE HOUSE EXPENSES.
“I Don't know how it is, my dear, but when I remember that there's only
you and myself—just two of us, and I eat and drink next to nothing—and
when I see what other people do with half our money, I do think you might
be a little more careful. I'm sure I spend no money on myself—none.
Nobody can be more watchful of every sixpence; but, of course, a man can
save but little when he knows—or, that is, when he fears he knows that
everything's going to waste at home. Besides, it's a woman's place—parti-
cularly a woman's place—to save. Women were designed for it. Economy is
one of the noblest virtues bound up with matrimony. There can be very
littlereal love, MRs. CAUDLE, where economy's neglected. A woman can't
truly care for a man’s heart, unless she has an equal regard for his pocket:
the things go together, and always did from the first.
‘‘No, MRs. CAUDLE, I did not lose at my whist club last might—that is,
only next to nothing; in other words, nothing to speak of. Now, that's
like your sex. You always set about hunting for some foolish, shabby
motive_for whatever your husbands complain about. Because I lose at
cards, I don't want to get the money back out of your cupboard. No : I
want to save money, that, should I be taken from you—and life at all times
is uncertain, MRs. CAudle—you might be left snug and comfortable—that's
my object. But I never knew any woman yet—except one, rest her sainted
soul!—who had the mind or the generosity to allow a truly noble motive to

help it—poor things!—nevertheless, when, a man is depriving himself of
i. little enjoyment that he may lay by something for a rainy day, it is
* —a little hard, I think—to have a woman spend what you do in house-
eeping.
*pº, MRs. CAUDLE, be rational; and, for the thousandth time, let me
beg of you not to cry. You only waste your trouble and your tears. Both
are thrown away upon me : I'm not one of the people, I tell you again, to
be melted with a little soft water. My expenses, that is, your expenses are
dreadful. Your grocer's bill—and when I never taste sugar in my tea—is
preposterous; enough to ruin a man of ten thousand a year. What? I take
sugar in my grog, and so do my friends P. Scarcely any—nothing to speak
of ; not worth naming.
“And then look at your butcher for the last fortnight. Well? I know
I won't eat cold joints. I had enough of them with my first—that is, I can’t
bear 'em. Besides, with half the money you have, a cold joint's an insult
to any man.
“And finally, Mas. CAUDLE,-for you know I hate this talk at breakfast,
it's a meal, of all others, I like to enjoy when I can,—finally, I have made
a calculation, and in the next month, come what will, your cupboard must
do with ten pounds less. It's for your good, I tell you, when l'm gone, and
ten pounds I must have of you.”

what I've paid for hosiery, you've worn in velvet and silk.
“If I could only be sure of this, I should know very well how to act.

The Saturnalia now prevail;
The white and classic foam
Soars high above the porter pots
Of proud and ancient Rome:
Upon the Capitol at night,
There is the cry of “beer,”
As the pot-boy, in histoga,
Salutes the vulgarear.
And from the seven hills of Rome
There is a festive shout
Of youths who ask each other, “If
Their mothers know they're out.”

For many a nose, a Roman nose,
In many a jug will dip.

SHOWING HOWiMR. CAUDLE LEFT HIS WIFE A WIDOW.
MR. CAUDLE, ere he left this world, had much more “Breakfast Talk”
with his unfortunate wife; but it is believed that we have given the principal
heads of his discourses: for his topics were like the church bells, they nearly
always rang the same morning peal. To the reader who believed in the
declaration of the first MRs. CAUDLE that her husband “was really an
aggravating man,” with her prophecy that “the world would at last know him
as well as she did,” the conduct of the individual towards the ensnared and
unfortunate Miss PRETTvmAN may not afford surprise. CAUDLE himself,
however, set up an ingenious if not a credible defence. PRETTYMAN, his
brother-in-law, had now and then remonstrated with him. “I don't mean it
—upon my life, I mean nothing. I'm very fond of your sister—extremely
fond ; it's only a habit, my ill-treatment—nothing but a habit.”
“A habit l” cried PRETTYMAN, “why that's what we complain of .
That's what we want you to get rid of.”
HIS DEFENCE OF HIS TYRANNY.
“Impossible, my dear boy—quite impossible. Having lived so many years
with the late MRs. CAUDLE-though I believe her to be a sainted woman
notwithstanding—how was it to be expected that I shouldn't make a natural
use of my liberty. You don't suppose I was going to suffer Mrs. CAUDLE
the second to be only another MRs. CAUDLE the first,-so you see I bent the
bow the other way.”
“And this is your defence?” cried PRETTYMAN.
“My excellent friend,” said CAUDLE, “bad temper's catching. There-
fore, let folks beware how they come together. If I've been a little bit of a
tyrant in my second marriage, 'tis only because I was a slave in the first ;
and all tyrants, my dear boy, are only slaves turned inside out.”
“I can make nothing of that figure,” said PRETTYMAN, “but this: that
in most marriages there are faults on both sides.”
“Exactly so,” answered CAUDLE, “and both I've known.”

THE CITY CIVIL WAR.
EGRETFULLY we announce that after thirty
years of peace, WAR Has BRokEN out
—in the City. Blackfriars pier has
been turned into a field of battle,
where scenes not yet of bloodshed,
but of hat-shed, have been acted
every day; and though there has been
hitherto no positive carnage, there
has been serimmage in its maddest
sense, and a to-do of the fiercest cha-
racter. Like all wars, the Battle of
Blackfriars did not break out until
after the contending parties had been
long engaged in correspondence.
The first indication of hostility came
in the shape of a Guildhall protocol,
addressed to the Watermen's Com-
pany, with the view of limiting the
right of visit claimed by that frater-
nity. A considerable quantity of diplo-
macy was the result, and the parties
were at length brought to an issue.
The Thames Navigation Committee
declared the Watermen should not
visit the Blackfriars pier, except at
certain times, while º Watermen,
recollecting what had been the privi-
lege of their forefathers, resolved on
resisting the oppressive restriction.
War was now declared 1 and every
preparation was made by the civic
powers for resisting the enemy.
The makers of policemen's staves
were for some time in a state of
activity; and an order of a hundred
bull's-eyes warranted the supposition
that the contest was expected to be
carried on with such inveteracy that
not even the umbrella of night would
throw its protecting shadow over the
peace of the district.
Orders were given to put the pier
in a state of siege : Martial Law
was declared upon the dummy, and
Pier-keeper Hollingsworth was di-
rected to march himself and assistant
down in a double column to the brink
of the water, so as to allow of his
commanding a view of the coast as
far as Southwark. A body of twent
policemen formed the rear, whic
with twenty more brought down in
the van, and a reserve of ten under
the covered passage, gave an effective
force of fifty on the side of the City.
In the mean time the enemy was
not inactive, and the Watermen's
Company had already selected CAP-
TAIN Phillips, of No. 6, to lead the
important enterprise; Pºurs was
a sailor of some experience in the Thames Navy; he had been present at the blockade of Gravesend
Pier, and had moreover distinguished himself by º the º out of Hungerſ td. He had
also, on one ºceasion, quelled a mutiny on board the ºhelor by leaping on to the paddle-box,
and singing, “Rule, Britannia,” in the midst of the grew, º e insurgents to tears, and causing
the stoker, in a moment of remorse, to quit the servic ey
It will be seen, therefore, that Philips was likely to prove a formidable foe to the citizens.
He left Woolwich with a gay heart; his flag flying in the air, his smoke mounting playfully
towards the clouds, and his funnel roaring defiance to the enemy. On his way up the river, he
several times addressed the crew under his command, urging them to strain every nerve in defence
of their rights and liberties. “Gentlemen,” said he, “we go to beard the tyrant in his lair.
Remember the words of Nelson: “Woolwich expects every man to do his duty.' Yes, Gentlemen,
disgrace lies that way, and glory lies the other. Take the first on your right for fº and there you
are ; but take the first on your left, and then—where are you?”a Three truly British cheers re-
spond * ese noble sentiments; and every
one º e |. force was eager tº give battle
to the enemy.
In the rails of the City the scene was hiſtless
invi fig. The Pier keeper reviewed the
troops at eleven o'clock; and, as he passed up
and down the lines of the police, he addressed
cheering observations to each of them. “Ha,
41,” said he, to a veteran of the Civic Blues,
“you and I have fought side-by-side ere this.”
The gallant fellow, who had been through the
whole of the tee-total campaign on Kennington
Common, replied witharespectfulwink. “What,
my old comrade, 46,” cried the Pier-keeper,
addressing a stalwart fellow who had been
broiled beneath some five thousand suns, “how
comes it you are still in the ranks? We must
have: some promotions, I see, after the battle.
We shall want serjeants, and where shall we
find them if not among our own companions
in arms "
Thus did the skilful leader infuse courage into
his cohorts, through themedium of their hopes,
paving a way to triumph for himself over the
vanity of his soldiers.
At length the ship of the formidable PHIL-
Lips hove in sight, and a shout of derision was
the first symptom of hostility. The Pier-keeper
rushed about with frantic energy among, the
force under his command; and, with a loud
exclamation of “Men, to your truncheons !”
he prepared to watch from the upper end of the
pier—through a large telescope—the result of
the encounter. Phillips struck the first blow,
by banging his vessel against the side of the
pier, by which movement the civic forces were
a little shaken; but they presently rallied, and
though the line had been broken for an instant,
it was soon formed again.
PHILLIPs now summoned the pier garrisonto
surrender; but the Pier-keeper, from his secure
position at the upper end, hurled defiance
through a speaking-trumpet, and, roaring out
“Victory or Death,” retired as fast as he could
from the field of battle. The engagement now
became general; and one of the volunteers.
under Phillips, belonging to a corps of gentle-
men-passengers, succeeded in effecting a land-
ing. They were, however, instantly taken
prisoners; and PHILLIPs, giving the word to luff,
retreated in the direction of Hungerford.
Thus ended one of the most formidable con-
tests that ever shook the peace of the City.
The loss on both sides was severe; the invaders
having lost several passengers, a steam-boat
fender, and a quarter of an hour. On the side of
the police there was also a frightful loss—of
temper.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH*S POLITICAL DICTIONARY.
oxinſons, House of. Some-
times called the collective
wisdom. The knights and
burgesses were originally
summoned that they might
come and be taxed, as the
ducks in former days were
invited by the endearing
term of dilly-dilly, to come
and be killed. In the course
of time a practice sprung
up of telling the victims
what their money was want-
ed for; and they began to
give their opinions on the
subject, which was the ori-
gin of the debates that have
since become almost as great a bore to us as the taxes were to our
forefathers. At the revolution of 1688, the Bill of Rights vaguely
declared, “that the election of Members of Parliament ought to be
free;” but it has been frequently laid down that “ought stands for
nothing.” Seats in Parliament could formerly be taken and paid
for like the seats at a theatre; but the Reform Act has interfered
with this arrangement. There were also certain close boroughs,
called close from their being in very bad odour.
ConsERvATIvE PRINCIPLEs. The theory of taking care of the
Constitution, and the practice of taking care of one's self.
Constitution, THE BRIt Ish. It is said that a creaking door
remains long on the hinges, and the healthy condition of the British
Constitution, in spite of the many severe attacks and shocks it has
sustained, is a case quite in point with that we have alluded to.
England may be said to have the Constitution of a horse, and, consi-
dering the variable nature of our climate, this is a very fortunate
circumstance. The Constitution seems to be adapted to all the poli-
tical seasons, whether boisterous or fair ; and it even survived the
storm which PITT, the celebrated pilot, weathered. The Constitu-
tion has received several death-blows, but not one has yet proved
fatal. Its doom has been frequently sealed, but it has not yet re-
ceived the wax that will settle it. Every now and then we are called
upon to rally round the throne in defence of the Constitution; but
as there is no admission to the throne-room, the suggested rally cannot
take place very easily.
Convention, in English politics, is an assemblage of lawyers,
clerks out of situations, shop-boys out of employ, and would-be
patriots out of luck, who meet at public-houses to lay down rules for
governing the country, and to run up a score with the landlord.
There have, within the last few years, been two or three Chartist
Conventions, which have lasted while the members got credit for
their motives, and credit also for their beer. When the latter ceased,
the Convention has invariably mizzled.
Copyhold. A term in English Law. Formerly every copyholder
was a pure villain; but if this were the case in the present day, half
the London landlords would be thorough rascals, for most of the
property is copyhold.
CopyRight is, according to Lond MANsfield, the sole right of
printing and publishing anything intellectual; but the Magazine-
writers and Novelists have a copyright in their works, so that intel-
lectuality is not indispensable. In the reign of her present MAJEsty
a new Act has been passed, extending the term of copyright to forty-
two years, and any author wishing to take the benefit of the Act may
do so without going in the usual way through the Insolvent Court.
The 5 & 6 Victonia, chap. 100, has given a copyright in designs,
which no one is allowed to pirate; but SIR. R. PEEL has infringed
on the copyright of Lond John Russell, by pirating many of the
latter's political designs. There is now a copyright in carpets, and
if an author has a novel on the tapis, he can have it protected.
Coax Laws. On the principle involved in the proverb de mortuis
nil nisi bonum, we say nothing of the Corn Law, which at our present
writing may be considered in articulo mortis. The Corn Laws caused
the Whig Ministry to be beaten in May, 1841; but it has been wisely
said, there is a natural connection between corn and thrashing.
These very objectionable laws, which so frequently curtailed the
supply of food, in one sense, have, in another sense, repeatedly fur-
nished food for indignant comment. Sentence has, however, been
passed upon the Corn Laws, which are doomed, and only waiting for
an executioner. The League has been chiefly instrumental in causing
their condemnation.
* CoRNET. An officer in a cavalry regiment, whose rank corresponds
to that of Ensign in the infantry. He carries the Standard—not the
newspaper, for that would either send him to sleep on his post, or
crush him with the extreme weight of the article.

Oº readers will have perceived by various paragraphs that there
is an intention on the part of the Government to re-organise the
Militia. This patriotic old corps has dwindled down to a few cor-
pulent sergeants in different parts of the kingdom, who keep up what
they call a dépôt, consisting generally of one room, hung around with
big drums and other military trophies belonging to
“The days when they went soldiering,
A long time ago.”
The announcement of the intended calling-out of the Militia has
given an impetus to a vast deal of smothered patriotism, which it is
expected will break out all over the kingdom into a scarlet rash, in
the shape of a general putting on of red uniforms. In the neighbour-
hood of Hammersmith the patriotic flame is burning with peculiar
brightness, and one volunteer has already entered himself at the
Station House as a man determined to lay down his life and his
business in the cause of his country. This energetic individual has
formed himself into a Corps of One, and has valorously called upon
the War Office to send down an efficient Staff for the purpose of
reviewing him.
l
| THE PROSPECT OF WAR. "
A field-day will, it is expected, come off shortly on Brook Green
when this Valiant Unit will draw himself up in front of the officers
who will be entrusted with the task of reviewing him. The scene
will, it is expected, be very animating, and the manoeuvres gone
through will embrace the whole of the platoon exercise, performed
alternately with an umbrella and a musket; for it was found, during
the old Militia campaign, that the soldiery suffered more from the
rain than from the enemy.
When we remember that Hammersmith is the key to the metro-
polis on the western side, and that Brook Green may be considered
one of the bolts of the Great Gate of London, it is comfortable to
feel that we have a pledge of the loyalty of the district in the military
enthusiasm of its inhabitant. NApoleon used to say that he never
need have lost Paris if he had been certain of the banlieue, and there
is a comfort in knowing that the foe must cut its way through Brook
Green before it can penetrate into the capital.
The one volunteer will, it is expected, obtain a commission, which
will enable him to practise the noble virtue of self-command, which
indeed constitutes the true hero.
A SQUIB AND CRACKER PARSON.
UR attention has been called to the subjoined paragraph in
| the Liverpool Mail t—
“On the 5th of November, the Rev. D. JAMEs preached a sermon
at St. Simon's Church, Liverpool, on the Gunpowder Plot, in which
he remarked that “Protestantism was full of light, and that children
should be allowed to burn their bonfires, and that rockets, squibs
[blue lights and Roman candles], should be let off on that day to com-
memorate the event from generation to generation. The security as
well as permanence of their religion depended upon such observances,
as the rising generation would, by that means, be secured from any
contamination with Popery; and thus eventually the land would be
blessed with the light of Protestantism, which was the light of pure
~, religion.'”
There is much wisdom in the Rev. D. James. In our imagination, we
see him in his pulpit, as we have seen Diavolo Antonio on the tight-rope,
with a blazing back-board of fireworks. A human speck, glorified by
Catherine-wheels, squibs, and crackers . We think, too, that a new and
cate the state of the Church. It would, in truth, become a pretty popular
superstition. For instance, if the rockets shot well into the sky, it would
argue brilliantly for Protestant Ascendancy. If the golden drops ex;
ploded and came down in a magnificent shower, the Bishops might, feel
secure of undiminished wealth. If the Roman-candles burned dimly, it
would be a great triumph over the Puseyites and the Pope: “The secu-
rity as well as permanence of religion” depend—infers. Ma. James-on

theological mysteries of gunpowder. We did think, in our forlorn igno-

taught us better. Its foundation is evidently squibs and crackers. It is
plain that MR. JAMEs's SAINT PETER is SALT PETRE.

ELovED PEEL,~When you
were popularin Downing
Street I never spared
you. I never scrupled
- to turn you and your
measures inside out, and
say my say of you and
them. And this, I did,
without one drop of gall
in my ink; for I felt no
malice towards you. You
never denied me any-
thing, for Inever asked
aught at your hands.
Although I have a hun-
dred poor relations—at
least, a hundred who
have claimed kin with
me since I have been
a prosperous authority
in the world, though I
never heard of them
whilst I was compelled
to get my bread in the
street,_yet have Inever
listened to their prayers
to ask of you even a
crumb of the loaves, or so much as a tail of one of the fishes. I have
at least half-a-dozen nephews who have panted for tide-waiterships,
and—you know it—I have never asked you to take pity on one of
them. “No,” I have said, magnanimously tossing a half-crown to
one, a dollar to another, “go and trade with lucifers, buy yourself
a net of oranges, set up a walking penny sandwich shop; but do not
hope to make me bother the Minister. Punch will be independent,
and ask nothing of PEEL.”
Well, it is only the self-same generous nature that now
sympathises and condoles with you.” “By yon marble heaven,”
my heart bleeds for you! Yes, SIR. Robert, it shall not be said
that in this, the day of your tribulation, you have not a friend.
Punch slaps you on your shoulder, and cries “be of good heart.”
Mercy upon us! What a shower of ink is falling upon you on all
sides : What scores and scores of pens—goose-quill and steel—
are stabbed at you ! The Post lies before me. What stale eggs—
what examimate cats and dogs—what foul cabbage-stumps from the
garden of rhetoric—what muddy dregs of an inkhorn are flung at
you ! Flung, too, with a joyousness, a glee, never exceeded in the
neighbourhood of the pillory !
And have you deserved this? Can men have no compassion—no
pity for what you have undergone? Can they not conceive the more
than Vulcanic labour to attempt to melt a cast-iron Duke º Have
they no thought of the terrors of that ferrea cow? Are they incapable
of a single touch of sympathy for the man who has laboured to trans-
form the sow's ears of landed dukes into silk purses for the manu-
facturers? Are they reckless of the baiting, the badgering, the
bullying that, for weeks past, you have endured at the Council :
Well, we have seen the dens of the lions, the tigers, the hyaenas at
the Zoological Gardens. Rather would we select any one of those
nooks, with a cheerful trust in the merciful amiability of any one of
the tenants, than live your late life—dear SIR. Rosent –at the
royal council table. But what cares the world for this—for all your
days of turmoil—your nights of sleeplessness—with now and then
the nightmare, in the form of “the Duke,” sitting astride on a forty-
two pounder, weighing a mountain on your breast?
And is it true, SIR Rohent, that you have no friend? Have you
lost all—“all that were most dear to you?”. Yes; it is the fero-
cious exultation that you are a friendless politician I ºf or how
many weary years have you laboured, only at last to stand alone?
In the shades of Tamworth only do you find sympathy and solicitude!
And still, day after day, is your reputation tattooed. All sorts of
monstrous forms are pricked into it by five hundred quills. This it
is to be achief! We are much more cruel than the New Zealanders;
for when they would mark a leader they employ only one agent—the
priest—who, says a late authority, “performs the operation with a
pointed bone instrument, the juice of a particular tree being insertedin
the cuts, to give the blue tinge.” Now—hapless Sin Rosent —who
shall count the number of pointed instruments at this moment
piercing the cuticle of your fame? Not the Post alone, the Corn-
Law priest, digs its quill, or iron, into you, “inserting in the cuts.”
vinegar and the juice of aloes, to give them, to all posterity, a blue
tinge; but there are hundreds of pointed weapons pricking at you:
and—so horribly fantastic is the work—who shall clearly make out
all the fancy dragons, and monsters, and reptiles made indelible upon
you? Poor SIR. Robert 1
And therefore do we, at this festive season of the year, write you
this little note of consolation. Because so many other pens are
piercing you, we would fain let fall from our quill some few drops of
balm. Therefore, good SIR. Robºt, do we hope that—for Christ-
mas, at least, you will be tranquil—happy. And to that end may
your beef sit lightly on your stomach; may your plum-pudding melt
deliciously in your mouth; your mince-pies dissolve like honey-

fingers—come off well at snapdragons! And, should destiny deter-
mine you to take a hand at around game—say speculation—may you
never turn up a knave, or—again sinking under agricultural weapons,

THE DUCAL GALLERY.
Aving been favoured
* an early copy of
this magnificent vo-
lume, we hasten to re-
view it. It has the
reat merit of being
eculiarly suited to
e times. The get-
ng up and binding
in calf) are almost
A unexceptionable. To
our simpletaste, how-
ever, thereistoomuch
gilding and too little
lettering. The first
portrait that strikes
us on opening the vo-
lume is entitled
The Protectionist Duke.
This is the work of a
tenant farmer, taken
after an agricultural
dinner. It is remark-
able for the colouring,
though we should
decidedly say it was
flattering to the ori-
ginal. The character-
istic features of pride
of order, self-confi-
dence, and hatred of
change, are strongly
brought out. The
artist evidently worked con amore. Perhaps a slight unsteadiness
in the handling may be attributed to the fact, recorded above, that
the likeness was taken after dinner. The companion work,+
The Royal Duke and the Blighted Potato, is very much to our taste.
His Royal Highness, whose face is so well known to the charitable,
is represented at a public dinner, good-humouredly remonstrating
with a very black and angry-looking tuber upon his plate. He is
evidently saying, “Pooh, pooh, blighted! nonsense, nonsense I can't
bel beautiful potato I quite good enough to eat rather like you!
(Aside) Here, take my plate away.”
A few pages further, and we have a historical picture, with the
title, News of a Resignation. The scene is the entrance hall of the
Carlton Club. The steward and several upper servants are sur-
rounding the newsman in attitudes expressive of hope, fear, and
defiance. The expression in the face of the short footman who, with
his right hand upon his heart, his left holding a soup-basin, seems to
be making a solemn appeal to the altar of the Constitution against
the tidings is very finely given. The tall attendant, in plain clothes,
is expressing his disgust at PEEL's conduct; while the hall-porter,
overpowered with the intelligence, falls into the arms of a youthful
page, who appears to sustain his weight with difficulty.
An admirable sample of ducal amateur art is afforded by The
Agricultural Labourer enjoying himself. The Labourer is represented at
the close of his day's work, by his fireside : the fire is small, and just
expiring. The Labourer is anxiously watching a pipkin of hot
water, while he holds between his finger and thumb a pinch of curry
powder, ready to drop it into the water the instant it boils. With
the other hand he keeps back his wife and children—a picturesque
andragged group—who are crowding as if to contest his simplemeal.
Nos. 8, 9, 10, 11, &c., up to 20, are all on the same subject, The
Labourer. We must protest against them as egregiously flattered.
We understand the originals stood for the groups of happy tenantry
on the occasion of the Royal visit to Stowe, and, indeed, the name
CHANDos, in small letters on several of the series, would indicate
that they are the work of that distinguished artist. This accounts
for the extreme unlikeness of the portraits to anything we have ever
seen of the real English labourer, and also for the surprising absence
of that “looped and windowed raggedness” which experience has
led us to believe inseparable from the class.
The Reward of a Life, one of those subjects which fill the patriotic
heart with gratitude. The scene is the dining-room of an agricultural
society. A labourer, who has supported a large family for twenty
years on 7s, a week, is receiving the munificent donation of a sove-
reign and a coat from the hands of a noble lord. His face expresses
the struggle between honest pride and gushing gratitude, while the
donor's condescending affability is beautifully given. The motto,
“Go thou and do likewise,” is happily chosen, as it may apply either
to the giver or recipient of this noble reward. Every labourer should
have a copy of this print framed and hung up in his cottage, between
its usual and most cherished ornaments, The View of the Union, and
The Happy Family. -
Besides these portraits and historical subjects, we have others of
the mixed and landscape class. Among the former, we would parti-
cularly direct attention to The View of the State of the Country, by the
Duke of Richmond, as one of the most soaring flights of fancy we
have ever witnessed. MARTIN's mistiest visions are tame to it, and
TuRNER could not deviate from nature with happier boldness.
Another series, as remarkable in its way, is TYRELL's Views upon
Trade, which, with the companion prints, Noarolk's Views of Cookery,
and SIBTHoRPE's Views of Science, would form beautiful cabinet pic-
tures, and, indeed, are out of place anywhere but in a cabinet. We
fear they are too imaginative to find purchasers at present.
Nothing more horrible was everconceived by Fusel1, after his most
copious indulgence in pork chops, than Newcastle's View of a Free
Trader; a more ghastly creation, we hope, it may belong before we
see again. If such things exist, we believe it is only in uninhabited
regions, like the head of the writer in the Standard.
Here we leave this remarkablework, the publication of which will,
we believe, form an epoch in our history.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ASSAULT ON PRINCE ALBERT,
ATs may look at kings. It is their
prescriptive right : their privilege, no
doubt secured to them by the com-
mon law, since no human memory
can tell the time when they did not
enjoy such immunity. There is a
large mob of the well-dressed and
respectable, who, in the most perse-
vering way, dispute this peculiar right
of cats whenever the opportunity pre-
------- sents itself. Thus, the QUEEN cannot
take a walk from her palace, but Brighton grimalkins will, with their
goggle eyes, stare at her. The Prince, her husband, cannot visit, a
show of fat beasts without being subjected to brutal curiosity on the
part of the two-legged animals not exhibited. We have a recent in-
stance of this mixed stupidity and gross ill manners. A few days ago
the Royal ALBERT visited the cattle-show at the Horse Bazaar, where
he was so set about by “a gaping multitude,” that, says the account :
“It was a matter of the utmost difficulty for his Royal Highne. to observe with any-
thing like comfort the points and peculiarities of a single animal.
The farmers and butchers, we are told, were most respectful. It
was the genteel mob—the crowd of well-dressed and respectable
sight-seers—that troubled the Prince, and assaulted him with their
vulgar staring. They all of them, no doubt, thought of the cats, and
believed themselves quite worthy of cats' privilege.
* Observations such as-“Oh, there he is. See how he smiles He knows his own
beast; I told you he would,” greeted the ear in all directions.”
The nincompoops 1 The vendors of apples or oranges are fined
or imprisoned for stopping the way; can nothing be done with the
mob of respectables who give chase to Royalty—as though it was a
stray peacock—whenever it walks abroad in the world ! It would
hugely content us to see an example made of some of these stupid
offenders, who hunt and outstare a gentleman because, for the time,
it is his misfortune to be a Prince. We should like to have some of
them, just for a week or two, placed on the tread-mill, or set down
to oakum. For, is it not provoking, that PRINCE ALBERT cannot get
a fair sight of prize heifers and prize pigs, he is so thronged about by
those, we must call prize asses :
RAILWAY SCALE OF MANNERS.
We have often been struck with the difference of manner assumed by
railway officials towards different people. Shut your eyes, and you can
tell from the tone of their voices whom they are addressing. The follow-
ing examples will best illustrate our meaning. The Railway Potentate is
calling upon the passengers to get their ticketsready. He calls:–
To the Third Class.-Fortissime.—“Tickets, tickets, come get your
tickets ready.”
gºthe Second Class.-Forté-"Tickets, Gents.; get your tickets ready,
Ints.
To the First Class.-Piano.—“Get your tickets ready, Gentlemen, if
you please; tickets ready, if you please, Gentlemen.
Shame I
A LETTER from Naples says, “the Emperor of Russia is expected here.
The beg and pickpockets are all in prison, to be carefully kept there
till his visit is over.” Perhaps it is well enough to imprison the gars;
but we do not see why the thieves should be denied a sight of their mpe-
rial brother,-the Pickpocket of Poland.
A Capital Spec.
A garat deal of money might be made by taking extensive premises in
the City as soup-rooms, and selling nothing but the Norfolk soup at two-
Pence a basin. A pinch of curry costs about a farthing, and as hot water
imay be had for almost nothing, the profit on every basin of the Norfolk
Soup would be at least 150 per cent. This seems a more promising
undertaking just now, than even the Railways.
KEEPING IT IN THE FAMILY.
Ms. O'Connell has increased the subscriptions of his grandchildren to
the Repeal Fund. He knows well enough that it is only taking the money
out of one pocket to put it into the other.
JEAMES'S DIARY.

SouTHDown, B's eldest son,

“Never havingdone much

when a hinnasent boy, me

at Healing, and shoot spar-
rers in the Edges with a

taining my dressing-case and close.
“I was heverywhere introjuiced in the county as the great Railroad
Cappitlist, who was to make Diddlesex the most prawsperous districk of
the hempire. The squires prest forrards to welcome the new comer
amongst 'em ; and we had a Hagricultral Meating of the Bareacres
tenantry, where I made a speech droring tears from hevery i. It was in
compliment to a layborer who had brought up sixteen children, and lived
sixty years on the istate on seven bobb a week. I am not prowd, though
I know my station. I shook hands with that mann in lavinder kidd
gloves. I told him that the purshuit of hagriculture was the noblist
hockupations of humannaty: I spoke of the yoming of Hengland, who
(under the command of my hancisters) had conquerd at Hadjincourt &
Cressy; and I gave him a pair of new velveteen inagspressables, with two
and six in each pocket, as a reward for three score years of labor. Fitz-
waRREN, my man, brought them forrards on a satting cushing. Has I sat

THE LOST SENSES.
ILLUSTRAtions of the Lost Senses are frequently given by the Metropolitan Magistrates; and a
few days ago MR. Thaill favoured his audience, at the Police Court, with his ideas of deafness and
dumbness. An individual, alleged to be labouring under these maladies, having been brought before
him, the Magistrate addressed a few questions, which the deaf and dumb man, after a little hesi-
tation, commenced very glibly answering. Having got thus far, MR. TRAILL, with wonderful sagacity,
observed to the prisoner at the bar : “Now, do you mean to adhere to the story you first told, that
rou were dumb, and could not speak a word " For enormous Bulls, of which there are nearly six
in two lines, this little speech of MR. TRAILL is a perfect Smithfield Cattle Show. The man, after
having spoken several times, at length admitted that he was not dumb, upon being closely pressed by
the Magistrate.
Singular Unanimity.
DR. Buckland and his brother-savans have been unanimousin one thing about the potato, which was,
that the first thing requisite to save it was instantly to remove the peel. Russell and his party
in their desire to save England, seemſ to have been impressed with precisely the same necessity.
PUNCH'S DIGNITY OFFENDED.
DR. BowRING, the other day, at the great
Anti-Corn-Law Meeting in the City, declared,
in allusion to the Free ers, that—
“From the Pazmier himself, down to Punch, every-
body was with them. The PREMIER had shown his
adherence to their views by deserting his friends.”
From the PREMIER down to Punch, indeed 1
Punch never deserted his friends. Punch
never left his party in the lurch. Punch
never changed his coat, except for a new
one of the same pattern. Punch never ran
away with other people's clothes and then
wore them on his own back. Punch did
not invent the sliding scale. Punch never
bolstered up monopoly at all; his cudgel has
always been wielded against it. Punch never
upheld the Poor Law. The nation has not
Punch to thank for the Income Tax. The
worth of a thing is just what it will fetch ;
and Punch would be sorry to exchange his
Office, 92, Fleet Street, for that of any First
Lord of the Treasury. Down to Punch /
Does DR. BowRING go down the river to
Richmond Does he come down to London
from the country Would he reckon down-
wards from the Corporal to the Captain?
Up to Punch, DR. BowRING, if you please,
another time.
MINISTERIAL RUMOURS.
THE Morning Chronicle stated, the other
day, that Lond CAMPBELL had been remaining
at his town residence ever since the resig.
nation of SIR. R. PEEL, but had not yet had
an interview with LoBD John Russell. We
are not aware whether this paragraph was an
advertisement; but to us it looked exceedingly
like an announcement that LoRD CAMPBELL
was ready to undertake Chancellor's work on
the shortest notice. We were rather surprised
that the intimation did not conclude with a
significant N.B.:—“No objection to travel
and is willing to go to Ireland.”
It is not, perhaps, generally known that our
friend BRIEFLEss remained at his Chambers
throughout the whole of the crisis, never
leaving without writing on his door, “Gone to
dinner, return in an hour,” or “Please to
wait;” but no summons from Lond John
Russell was sent to him. This is a proof of
the ingratitude of party, for BRIEFLEss always
supported the Whigs in the dining-hall of his
Inn, and has been heard to say that he
would at any time throw himself into the gap,
if there should be any difficulty in finding a
Solicitor-General. The treatment he i.
received is wholly unaccountable, for it was
the opinion of his tailor—an influential voter
for a Metropolitan borough—that BRIEFLEss
is the very man for a crisis.
Fair Barter.
A GENTLEMAN advertises that he will give
wines in exchange for Railway scrip. They
consist of “Ports, Sherries, Claret, Cham-
pagnes, and fancy wines.” Fancy wines are
a fair exchange for imaginary property.
Worth Y OF REMARK,
It is a fact—and as the evening Mrs.
Harris says, we will stake our reputation upon
it—that Mrs. Gamp of the Herald did, one day
last week, write, that is, scold, a leader about
LoRD John Russell, and did not quote SYDNEY
SMITH !
DREADFUL Fog.—The fog in the City was so
intense, the other day, that a person actually
got into St. Paul's Cathedral without paying !

SPLENDID RUN WITH THE FREE TRADE HOUNDS.
EALLY these hounds have had capital sport,
so far, this season, and have done their
work remarkably well. The meet on Thurs-
day the 4th instant was Spinner's Improve-
ment, where such inroads have been ef-
fected on the Old Sliding Scale covers,
formerly impenetrable. .." field out,
and a run confidently expected. No one,
however, was at all prepared for the sudden
relinquishment of his hold by SIR BoBBY,
who, all at once, found his retreat too hot
to hold him. This was first decidedly an-
nounced by old Times, (who, by-the-bye,
has changed his note since last year). The
cry was taken up by CoppeN, BRIGHT,
CLAMoUR, and the rest, and the majority
of the field got cleverly away, in high spirits
for the coming run; but one or two were
thrown out by harking back to Standard
and Molly—these babblers got punished
of course.
LoRD John rode his old hobby, Public
Opinion, and rode hard ; and we may par-
ticularly notice, as among the foremost, Londs PALMeRSTON, Cottenham,
MoRreth, and Monteagle, and SIR John Hobhouse and MR. LABouchere.
On leaving cover, the varmint broke right away for Constituency Corner,
but soon altered his course, and pointed for Coalition Clump. All over
this ground the pace was great, and the country ºxceedingly stiff. Many
were the falls, saddles emptied, and heroes chopfallen. The number of
the field caused some confusion; but as the run continued, they settled
better to the job, and each man appeared to take a line of his own. Bobby
how turned to The Groves of Blarney, where he expected to find his old
earth of Maynooth ready to receive him—but it was no go, DAN had
been too many for him.
However, he was still full of running, and led over some waste ground
within view of Oregon Plantations, into which he well knew his pursuers
would not like to poke their noses. His last turn was towards the Down-
ing Street road, after which he gained ground considerably; so much so
that he quite nonplussed his foes, who came to a check in a potato field,
without knowing where to make a cast. As they seemed in the dark,
though without any intention of giving up, our correspondent informs us
he left them—but he will let us know how the run terminated.
MAGNANIMOUS MRS. HARRIS.
A few days ago, MRs. HARRIs stated in her Standard that LoRD John
Russell would be certain to take office; if only for this patriotic reason,
he would obtain thereby—a whole quarter's salary 1 Now, nobody save
the shrewd MRs. H., could dive so deeply into a statesman's soul, and
bring | so magnificent a motive. MRs. HARRIs well knows what she
would do for a quarter's salary, and can therefore readily divine the in-
tentions of others. We only wonder that MRs. H. did not, as is her wont,
clench her charitable hotion with a text from Scripture; for when she
wishes to be particularly mean and malicious, she never fails to quote
from her Bible. Nevertheless, other motives of Lord John have escaped
her. For instance, his Lordship, as Minister, would have dined very fre-
uently with HER MAJEsty. Now, as it is a known fact to MRs.
ARRIs that LoRD JöHN can rarely afford a dinner at home, can she not
perceive that the prospect of a few full meals at Windsor or Buckingham
Palace must have tremendous weight with the expectant Whig
Old Friends.
MARSHAL BUGEAUD and ABD-El-KADER met again, last week, on the
most friendly terms. They played a game of chess, smoked the pipe of
peace together, and parted the best of friends. It was agreed between
the two commanders that there was to be no firing, on either side, for a
month. News were despatched the same evening to Paris of a grand
victory:–2500 Arabs killed, and only one Frenchman.
A RUMOUR,
It is reported in military circles that a new hat, of a peculiar shape, is
already made for a new Commander-in-Chief. We are sure there is
nothing in it.

me messidges by her : while my exlent friend, LADY BAREACREs (on the
contry) was always sending me toakns of affeckshn by HANGELINA. Now
it was a cooling hi-lotium, inwented by herself, that her Ladyship would
erscribe—then, agin, it would be a booky of flowers (my favrit polly
anthuses, pellagoniums, and jyponikys), which none but the fair &s of
HANGELINA could dispose about the chamber of the hinvyleed. Ho! those
dear mothers 1 when they wish to find a chans for a galliant young feller,
or to ixtablish their dear gals in life, what awpertunities they will give a
man! You'd have phansied I was so hill (on account of my black hi),
that I couldnt live exsep upon chicking and spoon-meat, and jellies, and
blemonges, and that I couldnt eat the latter dellixies (which I ebomminate
onternoo, prefurring a cut of beaf or muttn to hall the kickpshaws of
France), unless HANGELINA brought them. I et 'em, and sacrafised my-
self for her dear sayk.
“I may stayt here that in privit convasations with old LoRD B. and his
son, I had mayd my propoasls for HANGELINA, and was axepted, and hoped
soon to be made the appiest gent. in Hengland.
“‘You must break the matter gently to her,” said her hexlent father.
‘You have my warmest wishes, my dear MR. DELA Pluche, and those of
my LADY BAREACREs ; but I am not—not quite certain about LADY
ANGELINA's feelings. Girls are wild and romantic. They do not see the
necessity of prudent establishments, and I have never yet been able to
make ANGELINA understand the embarrassments of her family. These
silly creatures prate about love and a cottage, and despise advantages
which wiser heads than theirs know how to estimate.”
“‘Do you mean that she aint fassanated by me?” says I, busting out
at this outrayjus ideer.
“‘She will be, my dear sir. You have already pleased her, your
admirable manners must succeed in captivating her, and a fond father's
wishes will be crowned on the day in which you enter our family.”
“* Recklect, gents.’ says I to the 2 lords,- a barging's a barging—I’ll
pay hoff SouTHDown's Jews, when I’m his brother—as a straynger–
(this Isaid in a sarcastickle toan)—I wouldnt take such a libbaty. When
I'm your sun.inlor I'll treble the valyou of your estayt. I'll make your
incumbrinces as right as a trivit, and restor the noble ouse of Bareacres
to its herly splender. But a pig in a poak is not the way of transacting
bismiss imployed by JEAMEs DE LA PLUCHE, Esquire.”
“And I had a right to speak in this way. I was one of the greatest
scrip-holders in Hengland; and calclated on a kilossle fortune. All my
shares was rising immence. Every poast brot me noose that I was sevral
thowsnds richer than the day befor. I was detummind not to reerlize
till the proper time, and then to buy istates; to found a new famly of
DELAPLuches, and to alie myself with the aristoxy of my country.
*These pints I reprasented to pore MARY HANN hover and hover agin.
* If you’d been LADY HANGELINA, my dear gal, says I, ‘I would have
married you : and why don't I? Because my dooty prewents me. I’m
*** dooty; and you, my pore gal, must cumsole yorself with that
ldeer.
“There seamd to be a consperracy, too, between that SILVERTop and
Lady HANGELINA to drive me to the same pint. “What a plucky fellow
you were, PLUCHE, says he (he was rayther more familliar than I liked),
‘in your fight with FitzwańREN 1–to engage a man of twice your strength
and science, though you were sure to be beaten (this is an etroashous
folsood : I should have finnisht FITz in 10 minnits), for the sake of poor
MARY HANN 1 That’s a generous fellow. I like to see a man risen to
eminence like you, having his heart in the right place. When is to be the
marriage, my boy?’
“‘Capting S.,’ says I, “my marridge consunns your most umble servnt

want him to put in his ore—I wasn't afrayd of his whiskers, I prommis

“LADY HANGELINA, too, igspawstulated in her hartſ way. “MR. DE LA
PLucHE (seshee) why, why press this point? You can’t suppose that
you will be happy with a person like me?’
“I adoar you, charming gall’ says I, ‘Never, never go to say any
such thing.”
“‘You adored MARY ANN first;' answers her Ladyship; “you can't
keep your eyes off her now. If any man courts her you grow so jealous
that you begin beating him. You will break the girl's heart if you don't
marry her, and perhaps some one else's—but you don't mind that.”
“‘Break yours, you adoarible creature I'd die first 1 And as for

Once for all, suckmstances is changed betwigst me and er. It's a pang
f part with her, (says I my fine hi's filling with tears), but part from her

It was curius to remark abowt that singlar gal, LADY HANGELINA,
that melumcolly as she was when she was talking to me, and ever so
disml—yet she kep on laffing every minute like the juice and all.
“‘What a sacrifice l’ says she, “it’s like NApoleon giving up Jose-
PHINE. What anguish it must cause to your susceptible heart 1.”
“‘It does, says I–Hagnies 1’ (Another laff.)
“‘And if—if I don’t accept you—you will invade the States of the
Emperor, my Papa and I am to be made the sacrifice and the occasion of

“‘I don't know what you're eluding to about Josey FEEN and Hem-
perors your Pas; but I know that your Pa's estate is over hedaneers
morgidged ; that if some one don't elp him, he's no better than an old
pawper; that he owes me a lot of money; and that I’m the man that
can sell him up hoss & foot; or set him up agen—that’s what I know,
LADY HANGELINA,” says I, with a hair as much as to say, “Put that in
your ladyship's pipe, and smoke it.”
“And so I left her, and nex day a serting fashnable paper enounced—

event.
THE CONSTELLATION JONATHAN.
We hasten to congratulate the scientific world on the discovery of a
new constellation, in reference to which the late message of President
Polk to Congress contains the following piece of fine writing :-
“Towards Texas, I do not doubt that a liberal and generous spirit will actuate Con-
gress in all that concerns her interest and prosperity, and that she will never have cause
to regret that she has united her “lone star' to our glorious constellation.”
The constellation JonATHAN is one to which Astronomy furnishes no
parallel, unless, indeed, one of the signs of the Zodiac, Sagittarius the
Archer, may be regarded as its representative. Jonathan, no less than
Sagittarius, is an Archer, being a notable shot with the long-bow;
“Honour bright” is a saying which is by no means an Americanism. Till
America adopts that saying as a maxim, Texas had better let her. “lone
star" remain alone in its glory, to which it will derive small addition by
a connection with the constellation Jonathan.

The custom of stuffing cattle to an unnatural degree, is, we are told,
desirable, for the purpose of improving the character of stock, and we
should be very glad to see the experiment tried of improving the charac-
ters of peasants and agricultural labourers by feeding them. We should
very much like to have an annual show of prize poor got up in the nume-
rous districts where the “friends of the working man” are so very busy
in cramming cattle with all kinds of herbaceous luxuries. If a good
quantity of fat stock is a sign of their owner being a good farmer, surely
a good quantity of plump, portly-looking labourers would be a testimonial
to the goodness of their employer.
We fear, however, there is no chance for any experiment being made
which would involve the necessity of generous dieting. There is a much
greater probability of a competition between the Norfolk and Buckland
principles, by a show of rival peasants, fed respectively on peas, starch,
and mangelwurzel, or the celebrated promoter of warmth lately intro-
duced to the notice of the poor in the shape of curry powder. We can
fancy what a capital catalogue could be made upfrom thematerials of such
an exhibition.

houses should be allowed to send in a limited number of paupers for com-

THE CIVIL WAR IN THE CITY.
y sad mismanagement this inveterate struggle for
dominion is still proceeding, and CAPTAIN
Phillips of the Waterman, No.6, is now gene-
rally regarded as the ABD-El-KADER of the
Thames, while the Pier-keeper has declared
himself the EL Hyper of Bridge-street, threat-
ening to hide all that stand in the way of his
authority by blocking up the gangways. We
and it is with a heavy heart we proceed to
action. As we drew near to the spot, everything
seemed to speak of war, forming an awful
contrast to the peaceful character of the ad-
was brimming over with the fruits of tranquil-
lity and commerce. Fleet-street was gay,
laughing, and animated. The tea-marts were
deeked out with their red Christmas-berries,
telling of quiet homes and all that sort of
thing; and the polite arts—which always
ºlourish in peace—the polite arts were being
practised at the linen-drapers' shops with their
usual effect, by the young men, the jeunesse
dorée of the city.
Everything breathed of tranquillity till we
turned the corner into Chatham Place, when it
became clear that we had got into a country
torn by internecine struggles. We found the
outposts—consisting of a wooden barrier-in
the hands of two of the City cohorts, numbers 6
and 7, to whom we declared ourselves in the
character of neutrals. We found 6, a determined
but humane man, disposed to cheerfulness,
but prepared for the most serious resistance to
the invading forces. He seemed to us to be
rather a strange compound of the cavalier of
Charles the Second's time and the Fine Old
English Gentleman of the present day; for he
was very cavalierin his treatment of stray boys
who approached, probably in the character of
scouts, while he tendered to us every infor-
mation that we desired. 7 was evidently of a
more serious turn of mind, but not less ready
for action than the mercurial 6; and, alto-
gether, the outpost could not be in better
hands.
We ascertained the plan of the campaign
to consist of a concentration of all the land
forces under a tarpaulin until the arrival of the
enemy. A picket of two was to be stationed
behind a bill-board, ready to rush out upon
any invader who should succeed in passing the
first barrier, when he would have been imme-
"diately routed.
* It will be remembered that this is copied from the beautiful ruse of
WELLINGron at Torres Vedras; but as 6 himself magnanimously
owned, “No commander need be ashamed to walk in the same shoes as
WELLINgron’s.” An enormous breastwork had been thrown up at the
outer verge of the dummy; and at the back of the barrier, hidden from the
sight of the foe, was planted the flower of the civic raw-lobstery. Nothing
could have been more complete than the preparations for giving the foe a
warm reception, and the men along the whole line, as well as under
the whole of the tarpaulin, were full of spirits, occasionally singing snatches
of the “Dashing White Sergeant” and other military melodies.
But now let us look what was passing in the camp—that is to say on the
paddle-box-of the enemy. Captain PHILLIPs called a council of war,
which met on the binnacle at three o'clock in the afternoon, and was at-
tended by all the officers. At this meeting a resolution was come to
declaring Blackfriars Pier in a state of siege, and a proclamation was
issued, dated from the Watermen’s depºt, offering to take passengers for
a penny, on condition of their being able to effect their embarkation or
disembarkation at the disputed Pier. This piece of policy puts PHILLIPs
on a par with MEHEMET ALL, SHEER. Doolam, RAMo SAMBE, and other
crafty characters, who owe no less to their natural ingenuity than they
owe to the sword—Ramo SAMEE, by the way, used to swallow his—and
PHILLIPs will go down to posterity with Isaahum Pacha, Mr. T. P.
Cooke, and other heroes of modern times.
As was expected, the offer of a penny passage drew tribes of passengers
to the Waterman's standard, and Patilºps left Woolwich with his heart
fluttering in his bosom and his flag fluttering in the breeze. Our account
must here terminate, for the wind was so high that we could not wait any
have but just returned from the seat of war, E
relate the result of our visit to the scene of L
joining districts. The place we had quitted
longer on Blackfriars Bridge to wait the arrival of the invaders, who were
at least half-an-hour behind their time.
There was a report that PHILLIPs had become a prisoner at Blackwall,
having fallen into the hands of a foraging-party from Greenwich. Later
advices said that he had struck his flag, but we afterwards heard that
there had been no striking on board the vessel, except on the part of the
fifth lieutenant, who had struck the second cabin-boy. It is, of course,
utterly impossible to vouch for the accuracy of any of these statements.
From the preparations that are made it is to be feared the war will last,
and the lutte will be undoubtedly of the most acharnée kind.
We shall visit the seat of war at least twice a week till further notice,
and have made arrangements for establishing a telegraphic communica-
tion between the Mansion House and the Punch office
NOBLE RESOLUTIONS.
At a select meeting of British landholders, the following resolutions
were unanimously agreed to:- -
1. That the appetite for food and drink, unfortunately implanted by
Nature in the agricultural labourers, is the great cause of their distress
and discontent. - ->
2. That for the security and quiet of the landowner, it is expedient that
some measures should be taken for allaying this craving for sustenance.
3. That for the better attainment of this object it is advisable to excite
competition by the encouragement of ingenuity; and accordingly that
prizes, varying in amount, should be awarded by the Aristocracy to the
inventors of the best succedaneum for bread, beef, bacon, potatoes, beer,
and other eatables and drinkables.
4. That rewards should further be offered for contrivances for super-
seding fire and clothing, the deficiency of which, no less than that of food,
is productive of dissatisfaction amongst the labourers.
5. That thanks are due to His Grace the Duke of Norfolk for his
suggestion of curry powder as a sedative to the stomach.

pilfered and appropriated by other parties, who have seized on the Nelson
Column, the Hungerford Bridge, the Exeter'Change Beadle, &c. :
This is to gibe ºutive, that the one volunteer of Brook Green has

A Christmas-boxes at this festive season of the year, those indi-
viduals who supply Punch with jokes have been to us for their annual
boon. Punch always does everything very handsomely, and he has, on
the present occasion, behaved with his customary munificence. The
following have applied for Christmas-boxes, and received them:—
The DUKE of WELLINGTon, who has lately served us pretty
regularly with jokes. . .
LoRD BRough AM, who has not lately found us such a regular
customer as we used to be, and as, when the Parliamentary Session

us something fresh from Billingsgate nearly every day.
PEEL has richly deserved his Christmas-box, for he has been
very useful to us by going his rounds.
Little John NY Russell has come to us with his Christmas-piece.
He has made a sad mess of it; but we have given him a trifle,
nevertheless.
There are a few other well-known characters who have received
Christmas-boxes from Punch, who kindly acknowledges their readi-
ness to serve him with fresh jokes; and he trusts they will be as
punctual in providing him with food for satire and merriment during
the ensuing year.
THE LOVELY GAME LAWS,
STILL game is a sacred thing, and still we must sacrifice to it.
Our religion towards hares and pheasants demands supply of victims.
News from the Shire-hall, Worcester, assures us that the magistrates
of that locality have a faithful, a pious eye towards what they hold
to be the vested interest of partridges. One JAMEs PALMER, a
cowman, has been fined 10s. with 13s.6d. expenses (sweet is that
same expense to the palate of revengeful law), for that he, having
shot at a lark
“Merely for the purpose of discharging the gun, he having taken it out to shoot the
rooks which had been picking up his master's newly sown wheat,”—
a covey of partridges rose from the ground, and took wing, leaving
behind neither killed nor wounded. The wicked man, we say, was
fined: a warning this to all who would shoot at larks, first to take heed
lest they disturb the repose of partridges. All the iniquity, however,
is not told. A man named PREstardo E was also fined 10s, with 13s.
6d. costs. His story was this: “He had been sent by his master to
shut a gate on the farm, and on his return to the farm he had met
the defendant.” This meeting of a man with a gun was, in the
opinion of the Worcestershire magistrates, a clear offence against
the law, and PREs.TRIDGE must be punished. According to the
old Roman superstition, it was thought bad luck to meet a hare—
how much worse the fate of the Englishman who meets another
Englishman with a gun thought to be loaded for a hare The cul-
prit PREs.TRIDGE has a wife and three children, and—think of the
sum, ye BERKELEYs, ye chivalrous “punchers of the head”—9s. a
week wherewith to support them. He, however, begged for mercy,
and obtained it. Yes, the blessed quality that “falleth like the dew
from heaven” descended from the Worcestershire bench on the
culprit head of PREst RIDGE, for he was granted “time to pay it.”
And with this grace, time of course, and precious opportunity to
teach his children due veneration for the wise, the humane Game
Laws. For instance, with ll. 3s.6d. to be saved from 9s. a week, for
having met a man with a gun—the sole witness, be it known, was
the gamekeeper—many, many slices of bread (butter we do not even
dream of) must be saved from the hungry bellies of the young cormo-
rants. Is Mr. BERKELEY an arithmetician If so, will he work us
the subjoined sum ?
Given, A man with wife and three children, at 9s. a week, with
bread at 10d. a loaf I
In what space of time, short of absolute starvation, can ll. 3s. 6d.

And when this sum shall be satisfactorily worked, will any other
admirer of the Game Laws—any clergyman, for instance—resolve us
this other, scarcely less important problem :
What—the money being pinched from the bellies of the aforesaid
—what amount of respect for the Game Laws, and for those who
vindicate them, will remain to the punished

PUNCH's POLITICAL DICTIONARY.
ounsel. A barrister, whose duty it ſis to
manage the causes of his clients, and get rid
of their effects. Some are called Common-
law Counsel, to whom law is not common at
all, for they are seldom employed; and there
are also Chamber Counsel, who sit in their
chambers, doing nothing, and so far deserve
the name. Counsel are punishable for mal-
practice by being prohibited from addressing
the Court; but that which prohibits Counsel
from addressing the Court is not so much mal-
practice as no practice at all.
Count. A foreign title, which may be purchased in Austria or
the Papal States at a very low figure. In the new tariff the duty
was not expressly taken off foreign Counts, but they probably came
under the head of “other live animals.” The English title of Earl
corresponds with the foreign title of Count, and it is called Earl
because it is of early origin.
Count-MARTIAL. A tribunal for trying military or naval offences,
such as the abandonment of posts and fortresses. Thus, if the guard
at Storey's-gate were to be thrown off his guard, or if a soldier in
command of a fort were to come to the conclusion that soldiering
was not his ſorte, and he were to desert, each would be liable to be
tried by a court-martial. Behaviour unbecoming an "officer or a
gentleman is punishable by a court-martial; and it will be observed
that an officer and a gentleman are regarded as two distinctly dif-
ferent personages. A court-martial always consists of a number
that is uneven, which accounts for the members conducting them-
selves frequently in a very odd manner. In a trial by jury, all must
agree to the verdict; but in trial by court-martial, the major part
will bind the rest; and there is a case of a Major who, though dif-
fering in opinion from all his brother officers, insisted that, as he
represented the major ſpart, his verdict ought to be received. A
General who desert his post may be tried by court-martial, unless
he be a generalpostman who deserts his post, in which case he will
not have another trial allowed him.
Counts, from the Latin word curia, because, as some say, people
find in courts a cure for their grievances, though the better opinion
is that a court is called curia, from the curious proceedings that go
on within its limits.
CREDIT, signifies the trusting or lending one man's property to
another; and my tailor, when he sends me home a coat, gives me
credit and does himself credit at the same time if the coat is a good
one ; so that the obligation is really mutual. Some political econo-
mists say there can be no credit without capital. But the absence
of capital is the very essence of credit; for when a man has not the
capital to pay a bill, it is necessary to give him credit. In a case of
credit, the party to whom credit is given is generally called the
consumer, though the other party often consumes much time in
running after the original consumer without being able to lay hold
of him.
THE DRAMA IN AMERICA.
It would seem that the genial soil of America had a wondrous effect
upon some English actors. We are continually reading of its miraculous
power on theatrical mediocrity. For instance, we ship a walking gentle-
man at Liverpool, and at New York he becomes a sparkling light come-
dian. A melo-dramaticranter bursts into a first-rate tragedy genius. We
have heard of a soil so fruitful that, drop a tenpenny nail in it over night,
and it will have grown to a crow-bar in the morning. In the like way,
the merest sticks from the English stage, planted in America, blossom
and (for themselves) bear golden fruit.
Singular Exhibition.
THERE has been lately exhibiting at numerous public meetings a
Mammoth Ass of the most gigantic kind, far exceeding anything that ever
yet was seen in the way of asinine development. The Mammoth Ass is
of the Norfolk breed, and has been fed partly on curry powder. It has
all the peculiar characteristics of its tribe, and is undoubtedly the greatest
donkey of the present day.

STREET ARCHITECTURE.
THERE has been a vast improvement of late years in Street Architecture;
but we do not think the art has yet reached anything like the perfection
of which it is capable. We are of opinion that houses should be built
after designs appropriate to the particular classes that are destined to
inhabit them. Let us take a Railway
Director. What reason can there be
for locating him in a structure like that
at Albert Gate, with nothing in its ap-
pearance to denote the quality of its in-
habitant It is true there are a couple
of stags below, but these unhappy
animals would not be tolerated in the
presence of the Railway King, who
should at once drive them from his
threshold.
Something in the annexed style
would be an admirable design for a
Railway Director's residence –
The abode of a merchant ought
surely to be in some way charac-
teristic of its inmate; and the form
of a strong box might be adopted,
as being not only suited to the subject,
but because many modern erections
might be easily transformed into the shape suggested. A little external
ornamental work would very; speedily convert the long pile of mercantile
buildings in King William or Moorgate Street into the following chaste
design of a strong box; and as home is or ought to be the centre of
the affections, there could not be a centre to which the affections of the
merchant would flyso naturally as to the object which is here represented:

A few years ago, one would have been thought mad to talk of building
houses for authors; but as in these days a literary man is permitted to
live somewhat as well as his inferiors, and to have an establishment of his
own, we may be pardoned the presumption of offering an architectural
design for an author's residence. The shape of an inkstand strikes us, as
being at the same
time appropriateand
convenient. The wid-
ening of the struc-
ture towards the top
affords an opportu-
nity for a good, range
of garrets, to which
early association
may have accus-
tomed the literary
occupant; and as the
“ruling passion” is
sometimes strong in
prosperity, he may
prefer the attic, in
conformity with the
custom of early
years, to the first-floor or basement. The annexed design is at the service
of any architect who is bold enough to speculate in erecting half-a-dozen
entire houses, with the view of getting authors for his tenants:–
We hardly know whether we are justified in proposing a design for an
astronomer's residence. Such people, like winter cabbages, thrive
better in the open air; and it would be probably better to plant them
out comfortably in hot-beds—as hot as the exposed position of the beds
would allow —from which they might watch the stars much more
effectively than if they were in doors.
That they may, however, occasionally enjoy a gaze at the stars under
shelter of some sort, we would suggest a telescope as a design for an
astronomer's residence. -
A farmer's residence-now that small farmers have given place to
large, and compact healthy cattle have been superseded by monsters fit
only for a tallow-chandler in his melting moments—a farmer's residence
Qught, under these circumstances, to be on a very gigantic scale. Some-
thing in the style of the accompanying engraving would make a very cha-
racteristic abode for a British agriculturist of the present day.

CROWNS IN DANGER,
At the present time the English crown is shown (we think) at
sixpence a peep. If the Frankfort Journal speak truly, the price
must very speedily run down to twopence: and for this reason,
diamonds will very soon become nothing better than shining vulga-
rities. A letter from Rio speaks of diamond mines recently dis-
covered in Brazil. “Hats full of the stones have been picked up,
and brought away. Two-thirds are of a yellowish tinge, and do not
possess the usual hardness of the diamond, but many of them are
very fine.” What follows is really alarming: “Every one who has
diamonds on hand is endeavouring to sell them at the best price they
can obtain, fearing a great reduction in the value.” We are assured
from persons in the confidence of the editor of the Morning Post, that
that distinguished individual looks upon the circumstance as one
calculated to bring many imperial crowns into great contempt. The
matter is really serious. For only consider, how much some sort of
nobility owes to its diamonds. Like a very ill-favoured picture, set
with brilliants, it hardly becomes worth the keeping, when the stones
are picked out. And then again for stars and orders I What, for
instance, would be Lond LoNDoNDERRY and other kindred spirits,
without diamonds to make them sparkle in the eyes of the vulgar?
They would, we fear, pass for very little better than the common;
whereas now, they are jewels of folks. Imagine the revolution in
high life, if we are to have diamonds for the million I It is to take
the dearest, noblest privilege from the rich. Strange as the story
from Rio may appear, we incline to believe it; from the fact that
several English peeresses (no, we will not give their names,) have
already disposed of their brilliants, whilst there is anything like a
market for them, with the benevolent intention of dividing the
proceeds among the poor. It is their noble intention to turn their
diamonds into potatoes.
It's Never Tooj Lates
It is never too late to begin anything. Jules JANIN was not ashamed
to learn English after he had translated the “Sentimental Journey.”
It is never too late to finish anything. Joseph HUME confessed it took
him ten years over his first joke.
It is never too late to go home. The SPEAKER of the House of Com-
mons has often been taken in with the milk.
It is never too late to retract anything offensive. MR HARRISON AINs-
.. most handsomely stopped his Revelations of London at the 39th
pter.
It is never too late to give up a bad habit. An old lady, aged 92, ceased
taking in the Standard last week, after having been addicted to it for
upwards of five months 11
SOMETHING IN A NAME,
THE second title of the Norfolk family is that of EARL of SURREy.
We understand the present head of the illustrious race intends to change
Surrey into Curry; for he insists that the latter was the original title, of
which the former is merely a corruption.

THE DELAPORTE TESTIMONIAL.
ſy T. is the prime excellence of goodness to beget what
"' is good. Truth engenders truth. Our readers are
already aware that a testimonial is about to be pre-
sented to LIEUTENANT WAGHoRN—that he is only
a Lieutenant, should, we think, call a faint blush into
certain faces at the Admiralty—for his having
shortened the overland route to India. Merchants are
grateful, and are resolved to reward the indefatigable
man accordingly. Well, a distinguished knot of
dramatic translators have taken the hint, and have
resolved to present a testimonial to MR. DELAPORTE,
the enterprising importer of French Vaudevilles and
Melodramas. By taking the route from Boulogne
viá Folkestone, and by then starting direct west
from the Bricklayer's Arms Station instead of going
to the London #. Terminus, MR. DELApoRTÉ
has hitherto distanced by at least half-an-hour all
other dealers in French plays; and the consequence
is that the English dramatist subseribing to MR. DELApoRre, may
be at least half an act in advance of his translating competitor who
buys at any other shop. We have heard of a recent instance which
proves the value of this speed. For on one occasion, a translation by
one of DELApoRTE's men was absolutely in rehearsal at the very time that
three other translations, by men patronising the other route, were
presented at the stage-door. We have heard that the Testimonial
is to be a small, but very elegant, bed-candlestick and extinguisher,
originally of French metal, but appropriately translated into the very
best Britannia.
D R. BU C K L AND’S EAT IN G-H. O U S E.
AN eating-house on a novel, economic, and scientific principle, is about
to be established, to be called the “Dr. Buckland's Head;" the dishes at
which establishment will be prepared on the principle recommended by
the Reverend DEAN of WESTMinstER, who has identified himself with a
new plan for feeding the people. The Doctor's favourite dishes of starch,
peas, and mangel wurzel, will be served up in every variety, to tempt the
public appetite. There will be an ordinary at one, consisting of three
courses, the first of which will consist of
FALSE COLLARS A LA BRUMMELL,
which will comprise a very strong starchy soup, the nutritious qualities
of which will be quite indisputable. This will be followed up by
MoUchoir DE Poche A LA TUTBURY,
consisting of a delicious entree of fricasseed pocket-handkerchiefs, starched
to the same degree that was found so beneficial in prolonging the
existence of the old lady of the place alluded to. This will be followed
by a third course of
SPLIT PEAS AU NATUREL r
and for the benefit of those who prefer it, there will be the alternative
of BuaxT Bones. There will of course be
MANGEL wurzEL A. DiscBETION,
* will render the eatables complete, while the drinkables will consist
O
EAU CHAUDE A LA POLAR PARTY.
We have very little doubt that a few eating-houses established on
these principles in different parts of the town, would be eminently
successful as speculations; and we strongly recommend some enterprising
individual, with capital enough to buy a pint of peas, a pound of starch,
and a bunch of mangel wurzel, to try the experiment.
SPEECH RESTORED TO “THE UPPER CLASSES.”
The “down-trodden aristocracy of England” have, at last, found
a voice. Farmers have their Mark Lane Earpress, Free Traders their
League. Political Economists their Economist, Milliners their Belle
4ssemblée, the Masses their Weekly Dispatch, Licensed Victuallers
their Morning Advertiser, Footmen their post, the World its times,
but “the upper classes of society,” it seems, have hitherto struggled on
silently, their sufferings unrecorded, their acts of beneficence unchronicled,
their ideas untyped. Much pondering thesethings, John Burke, author of
the “Peerage and Baronetage,” has undertaken to edit the Patrician?
which, “unbiassed altogether by politics and party, will be especially
devoted to “the upper classes of society;” so says the advertisement.
$ome may suggest that, since the pulpit, the magisterial bench, the
artist's studio, the milliner's work-room, the saloons, of Crockford's,
the drawing-rooms of Baker Street and Bloomsbury, are “especially
devoted” to the upper classes, they might, perchance, have found a voice
without calling in the aid of the Fourth Estate. But not so—there are
agricultural dinners given in which his Lordship's speech, or his Grace's
sentiment, are ruthlessly curtailed—nay, by irreverent reporters’ hands
reduced to accordance with vulgar rules of grammar. There are hes
of baronet or lordling, which the “gallery,” not being sufficiently “devoted
to the upper classes of society,” burks outright-there are midnight
sprees, which common newspapers call “ruffianly,” though baronets be
the heroes of them; ducal or lordly prosecutions, which a levelling press
has ventured to style “tyrannical.” One Honourable's verses have been
branded as twaddle; a Marquis's travelling journal held up aloft to
laughter; and not even royal battues held sacred from the lash of journal-
ism. Thanks to the author of the “Peerage and Baronetage,” these
revolutionary blots will no longer deform the fair face of society. The
upper classes have found a voice. “Orson is endowed with reason,” and
the world stands a-tiptoe for the oracular utterance.
How grateful the world should be to the Patrician 1–we, Punch,
especially. We shall no longer have our insight into the life of “the
upper classes” bounded by what of it JENKINs could snatch, with a fear.
ful joy, from servants’ halls or through area railings. We shall no longer
form our judgment of noble battues from the prejudiced reports of gentle-
men of the press, or our notions of aristocratic eloquence from the unsatis-
factory specimens in the County Herald.
THE FARMER'S CORN LAW SONG.
• I REMEMBER—I remember—when the price was very high,
I'd my hunters for December, and my racers for July;
On my brow, PEEL, on my brow, PEEL, .
There are sad signs of care;
For the prices are not now, PEEL,
What once the prices were.
I was merry—I was merry—when the 'lectioneerers came :

Now I’ve no one, now I’ve no one,
To say a word of cheer;
For the Squire and 'lectioneerers
They never come anear.
§ullitm's Comit Quatrúlts.
M. Julliºn having resolved on continuing his Promenade Concerts for
one month, has given his reasons for doing so. The first reason heal
is the early meeting of Parliament, but as his month will have expired
just as Parliament opens, there is something of the non sequitur in this
part of his reasoning. However, we must not look too closely into M.
JULLIEN's logic, and we congratulate him on the prolongation of his series.
He advertises several novelties for his extended term, and we understand
that he intends getting up “Those Evening Bells,” with a band of two
hundred performers, introducing the real muffin-bell and postman's-bell,
with solo parts for street-door bells, to be rung ad libitum by any of the
sporting young gents., who after the shop-hour frequent these concerts.
The grand national air of “Walker the Two-penny Postman,” is also in
preparation, with all the celebrated double-knock effects, and a terrific
larghetto played upon one hundred real knockers. The “Light Guitar” is
in rehearsal for a band consisting of one thousand guitars; and the “Arab
Steed.” is to be done for JULLIEN's own benefit, with the whole of BATTy's
stud of horses.

This splendid band of veterans, who distinguished themselves at all the
greatmetropolitan fires during the war, and gave an undying reputation to
Wormwood Scrubs by several field days and quarterly reviews, will be
called out into active service, in conformity with an order from SIR
JAMEs GRAHAM.
Lancaster and its two corpulent serjeants are already up in arms. The
dépôt has been searched, and a sabertash has been discovered, which the
two old serjeants are disputing the possession of Military enthusiasm is

At Brook Green the same spirit prevails. , The one volunteer has pur-
chased some gunpowder, and is going through the whole of the platoon
exercise, by firing at an old plaster-of-paris cast of the head of NApo LEoN.
He also rushes in among the geese, brandishing a walking-stick, and ex-
| claiming, “Up, guards, and at 'em,” after the manner of the Duke of
WELLINGTON. This looks well for the prospects of the country. It is cheer-
not yet dead in the North, for the two serjeants have often fought their |ing to know, that if America declares war, she must cut her way through
battles over and over again in the tap-room of the public-house, and they the heart and flannel waistcoat, the shirt, the bosom, and the surtout of

will do its duty, if it may have its regimentals repaired, the handles of its

BETWEEN THE PRINCE AND THE “POST.”
THE Post speaks of a rumour that PRINCE
ALBERT is desirous of the office of Com-
mander-in-Chief: the principal claim of his
Royal Highness being, we presume, on his
number of portraits as Field-Marshal. Cer-
tainly, no man has oftener had his sword drawn
for the benefit of his country. The Post, how-
ever, will not believe in this, as we think,
laudable ambition of the PRINCE Conson T.
No : the Post has a most intimate acquaintance
with the Royal ALBERT's thoughts and opinions:
“The Prince is not an ambitious man. He is satisfied—and
he has good reason to be so—with domestic endearments.”
Good reason to be satisfied . Of this pleasing
fact the Post is, of course, well assured. Its
habits of intimacy with the illustrious couple
renders it an undoubted authority. The Prince,
according to the same source, is also satisfied—
“With the position he so deservedly holds as the liberal Maecenas of the Fine Arts!”
If this be really (true, then is his Royal Highness the most easily
satisfied Prince we ever heard or read of. He is moreover satisfied—
“With the pleasure he must derive from giving a laudable example to English country
gentlemen as a master of hounds, and to English agriculturists as a successful breederl'ſ
And therefore is it likely that the Prince, blessed as he is with
placens uror; with the profound gratitude and high admiration of all
professors of the arts; with the treasures of his kennel; and his
prizes at the cattle-show—is it likely that he would forego the true
glory associated with these things, for the noisy, vapid honours of
the Horse-Guards : The DUKE of WELLINGTON has a hundred
orders and medals, commemorative of victories bought with human
blood : but what are they to the medals distributed at the Bazaar,
significant of the triumphs of oil-cake, mangel-wurzel, and good
swedes?

fairly—most unfairly snuffed us out. We know that you are a friend to

EXTRACT OF A LETTER ON THE LATE CRISIS.
[From the “Kelso Snuff Mull."]
2: HE following manly and straight-
sº, forward, letter has been ad-
an dressed to our respected towns-
man, MR. MacFARLANE, by a
gentleman holding a distin-
guished public situation in Lon-
don. It is the testimony of a
person whose means of infor-
mation cannot be questioned;
and when we name the writer,
MR. MAcPunch, of Fleet Street,
the public will agree with us,
that the composition (like every
other by the same pen) does
honour to the head and heart
of our countryman:—
“We are out of office, and Lond GREY has done it all. For my
own part, I told LoRD JoHN that, provided he would go for a total
Corn Law repeal, I was his man. We all said so. MacAULAY said
so. LoRD John agreed. At the eleventh hour in comes GREY, and
says he will not act with PALMERston as Foreign Minister; and the
embryo Cabinet is destroyed by that ill-timed objection, and the
pangs and travail of a week end in bitter disappointment.
“You will, perhaps, be anxious to know, my dear MAcFARLANE,
how this interposition of my LoRD GREY could ruin the just-formed
Administration. You will ask, is it possible that the world could
not go on without LonD GREY and with Lond PALMERston, or
without LoRD PALMERston and with LoRD GREY : Is each of
these noblemen absolutely necessary to the welfare of the empire,
and can't we survive unless we have both of them in a Whig
Ministry? You picture to yourself Death intervening—you fancy
that though GREY should perish, or TEMPLE be carried off to
ancestral vaults, or both eat each other up and expire: yet the
kingdom would survive, the sun would rise pretty much as usual,
and the stocks (after a period of mourning) would rally.
“In this, my dear Mac, you are in gross error. You do not seem to
understand that the Whigs are our natural leaders—appointed by
Heaven and the Red Book to rule and govern us. There are about
a dozen of this privileged class of noblemen—set apart from the rest
of the world—having government vested in them, as priesthood is
in the Brahmins, or was in the tribe of Levi. Read the Court Circular
about these Whigs—these great irrevocable rulers of ours. They see
nobody else; they keep aloof from the world which they govern.
It is Load John goes to Minto House, or MINTo to Lond JoHN;
or Load PALMEaston gave a dinner to Lord MINTo and Lord
LANsdown E ; or, the MARquis of LANspowNE entertained at
Bowood, Lond MINT0, LoRD PALMERston, Lond JoHN RUssell,
&c. They see only one another, these great Signors. They decide
in their conclaves what is good for us, no doubt. The working
people, headed by your Cobdens and WILLIERs's, work, and toil, and
strive—organise the forces of the country against the Corn Laws—
beat it down; and then Lond JoHN comes nobly in, and says, “Well
done, my heroes; you have conquered in this battle, and I place
myself at your head. I have been opposed to your measures for a
long, long time; but you have fought your fight so well, that I con-
descend to lead you. I am your natural aristocracy, I and
PALMEaston, and GREY, and the rest of us. Our services are
priceless. We intend to come into the Ministry upon your
shoulders.”
“It was in this way that Louis-PHILIPPE walked into Paris after
the three days’ fighting and revolution in 1830; and blessed the
people; and took the profits, and has ruled ever since as Managing
Director of the French Nation. PHILIPPE was always a Whig. He
lived in England, and profited by our institutions. There are
forty Articles in the Whig faith; the thirty-nine we know of, and
the fortieth is :—‘It is ordained by Heaven, and decreed by the laws
of Nature, that the Whig Lords should have governance and au-
thority over the people of England.”
“Load John is not a proud man, very likely, but he has these
convictions before-named, and acts upon them. There you have a
proof how honest he is. He conceives the Country can't be governed
without Lond PALMERston and Load GREY. They must rule, or
ICurring Street has no charms for him. So he doesn't hesitate a
moment: Office he resigns; it is impossible without Lord PAL-
MERston—the country may go to the deuce ; he can't preserve it
without Lord GREY.
“I tremble to think, my dear MacFARLANE, that some desperate
atheists may be even now thinking of denying this old dynasty
altogether, and asking, “Suppose GREY goes, and Russell after-
wards, and PALMERston the God of War, and all the race of
MINTo Suppose, when one lord can't agree with tºother lord, the
third lord finds it necessary to break up a Government: is all
England to be balked because their Lordships are so squeamish 1”
“I, for my part, however, must not speak. I was looking forward
to the Tape and Sealing-Wax Office as my berth, and may be con-
sidered an interested party. In my opinion the Whigs are so
necessary, that that I don't happen to know anybody else to take
their place. But, O my dear friend why—why wern’t GREY or
PALMERston out of the way 1
“Ever yours, truly,
“To P. Mac FARLANE, Esq., * T. B. MACPUNCH.
Edinburgh.”
INFIDEL TURKEY AND CHRISTIAN ENGLAND.
WE gather from a writer in Blackwood, that we might learn
lessons of wisdom and humanity even from the barbarous Turks.
In Turkey, the Criminal Code has been so much amended, that—
“The extreme repugnance of the present Sultan to sign, death-warrants, even in
cases which in this country would be considered as amounting to wilful murder, has
rendered capital punishments extremely rare.”
Hence, we much (doubt whether benighted Constantinople would
offer such ghastly exhibitions, as have this week edified the popu-
lation of Christian London. The Divan does not shed blood in
revenge: the Council of St. James's still demands an eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth, after the 'good old Jewish way. The English
Minister hangs according, as he says, to the Bible; whilst it would
seem the barbarous Turk legislates in the benevolent spirit of the
New Testament.
$tting the Q9In Year QBut amb the Ntſu Year #m.
THERE has been so much “seeing out” and “seeing in" for the last
few weeks, in a ministerial point of view, that it was quite a relief to have
a change, in the “seeing out” of the old year and the “seeing in" of its
successor. The poor old year made his exit very gracefully, but an
immense number of parties were given upon the occasion, as if everybody
was really very glad to get rid of him. There is one peculiarity about
the farewell of an old year; namely, that however popular a performer
he may have been in his time, there is no calling him on again or prevail-
ing upon him, as the Manager does upon SIGNOR RUBIN1, to undertake at
least eight or nine positively final engagements. -
The year 1845 made his positively last appearance on the terrestrial
stage and went through his day with as much freshness and energy as if
he had been just commencing his career, instead of quitting it. There
was perhaps a little too much tendency to rant and bluster, for he puffed
and blew very terrifically in several parts of his concluding performance.
His exit was however remarkable for finish ; and when he heard the first
stroke of twelve, his descent through the trap of Time into the fathomless
abyss of the Past was truly magnificent. ---
In order to give every aid to the situation, several families had pre-
pared snapdragons, which diffused a blue glare over the whole scene, and
bathed it in a lurid light that was quite in character with the incident to
which it was an accompaniment. Our own view of the grand tableau was
rendered still more effective by the sudden and ingenious removal of a
lamp from the apartment, as the old year went out; while the accidental
upsetting of a tea-tray by an awkward domestic on the staircase was a
little unrehearsed effect, that enhanced the solemn interest of the scene
amazingly, by giving the idea of a gong which is inseparable from all the
recognised notions of things of this description.
THE FREEDOM OF ELECTION.
*ALDERMAN Gibbs has been elected—that is to say, has elected himself
again—Churchwarden of Walbrook. He proposed himself, seconded him:
self, voted for himself, and declared himself elected. He then returned
thanks in a neat speech to himself in the glass, and concluded by giving
three cheers for himself. In the evening the honourable gentleman
dined with his constituents. Covers were laid for one.

PUNCH's POLITICAL DICTIONARY.
CURATE, PERPETUAL. A poor parson, who gets a curacy of fifty
pounds per annum; who, never getting any preferment, finds him-
self a perpetual curate and nothing beyond.
CURATOR. From the Latin cura, care. A Roman public officer.
There were Curatores riarum, who were classical Surveyors of the
Roads; Curatores operum publicorum, who comprised the Roman Board
of Works; Curatores Tiberis, equivalent to our Conservators of the
Thames; and who, probably, went annually swan-hopping up the
|
|
Tiber. We must not, however, confound tile dignified office of
Roman Curator with that of the curator at a museum; who is respon-
sible for the safe custody of the polished oyster-shells, filed butter-
flies, and stuffed sparrows, of which a museum frequently consists.
CURRENcy, from currere, to run, is a term applied to money, pro-
bably on account of the tendency which all money has to run away.
Customs, or Usages, are old habits of which no one can recollect
the origin, and which, when recognised by judicial decision, have the
force of law. The commencement of the custom must, however, be
buried in oblivion before it becomes dark and obscure enough to be
admitted to an equality with the law of the land. One of the customs
recognised by the courts is called the law of the road, which is chiefly
entitled to be considered as a law because of its paradoxical nature;
for “if you go right you go wrong, and if you go left you go right.”
has been the rule of the road from time immemorial. This custom
is, no doubt, as old as Cæsam and CAswallon, who, when they
fought in their chariots, drove to the left that their right hands
might be left free to give each other battle—or, to speak more
familiarly, to pitch into each other with the greater freedom. Some
customs which are inconvenient to a few, but afford recreation to
the many, are tolerated if no one can remember their commence-
ment ; such as the custom of playing at cricket on a common, which,
though occasionally involving the bowling out the eye of a passenger,
will be permitted if no one can call to mind who was the first to have
his eye pitched into. Reiterated user will not make a custom; as if
a boy uses himself repeatedly to knock at my door and then run
away, it is not a good custom, but he may find me an ugly customer
when he least expects it.
A GOLDEN RULE FOR certain Writers.
If an Earl makes a speech for the Abolition of the Corn-Laws, call
him “an itinerant spouter.” If, on the other hand, he holds forth for
monopoly, write him down “a truly eloquent and enlightened lord.”
NICHOLAS SNUBBED.
THE EMPERoR N1cholas has been to Rome, to see the Pope. The
meeting began with great civility,
“And so between his Darkness, and his Brightness,
There pass'd a mutual glance of great politeness.”
In a short time, however, the Pope took his Emperorship in hand,
as our correspondent assures us, dealing the knout upon the Empe-
ror's soul, as lustily as the Emperor's executioner ever knouted a
Polish matron. Some aver that the Emperor shed tears; a fact
borne out by the discovery of certain small globules of iron subse-
quently found where the Emperor stood. And then Nicholas,
taking the good old man by surprise, would kiss the Pope's hand ;
whereupon his Holiness, turning to CARDINAL LAMBausch IN1,4uoted,
in a low voice, from ShakspeaRE, glancing at the tainted member the
while—“All the spices of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.”
And then the Pope had the hardihood to talk to the Emperor of
death and judgment: it must be owned very free, very extraordinary
subjects to be broached to imperial ears. His Holiness even sug-
gested to Nicholas that he might some day be called on to “render
an account of his government;” whereupon, we learn that the
Emperor turned a little pale, and shook somewhat, possibly, seeing
for a moment the blood of mangled Poland—possibly hearing her
multitudinous shrieks. And the end of all this was, a promise on
the part of Nicholas that he would not treat his Roman Catholic
subjects like oxen, but really allew them some liberty of soul...And
with this promise, and crest-fallen like an eagle with the pip, he
departed from the Holy Father.
And then the Emperor tried the old Imperial way. He gave money
to Roman charities: he bought statues and pictures; but the stale
trick did not succeed. The Romans treated Nicholas with marked
contempt; in which they certainly showed higher morality than
many of the English aristocracy. They would not forget his whole-
sale robberies because he gave a few thousand scudi to the poor—
they would not forget his hourly cruelties practised on ten thousand
images of breathing humanity, because, forsooth, he may have bought
Mercy in marble, and the Son of Mercy on canvas.

THE LORD MAYOR AND BABY THIEVES.
It has not, for some time, been our good fortune to be called upon
to eulogise a Lord Mayor. We have now exceeding pleasure in
acknowledging the wisdom and philanthropy of his present Lordship
(the late never gave us a chance). A few days since, three boys—
mere children—were brought to the Mansion House, charged with
stealing a few peas, whereupon his Lordship eloquently bemoaned
the condition of the helpless creatures who, flung in want and idle-
ness upon the streets of London, became, of course, the vilest
thieves. It is their natural growth. They are as much reared for
Newgate as many of the beautiful babies, taken their morning airings
in the Parks, are reared for hereditary legislators. Some are born
for the House of Lords and some for the House of Correction; and
a wise, paternal Government, looks placidly on the infant starveling
of the street, seeing it grow into a thief, and then—with a most
virtuous wrath–visiting upon the offender imprisonment, and final
slavery. We are quite ready to hear all this called Quixotism—a
foolish attempt to make the world better than it is. We only ask,
what would society have been, had there been no men with pens in
their hands, to put down the manifold wrongs committed by society
-that society might be shamed into amendment? Hear the Lond
Mayon of London on this theme:–
“Society b ponsible for the cont ion to which poor children were
subjected. There was a total absence of restraint or good example, and the very
ingenuity displayed in the little acts of dishonesty perpetrated by those of tender years,
was encouraged by the laughter, and in some cases by the approbation, of the lookers-on.
ere was no calamity in his mind comparable to that which sprang from the bringing
up of youth inhabits and practices of idleness and vice. The Legislature spent hours
and days in discussing the principle of education, could the minds of the represen-
tatives of the people be more admirably, more benevolently employed than in derising
the means of correcting the awful evil which was always before the eyes of the magis.
trate, and was almost as frequently encountered by men concerned in the ordinary
transactions of town life.”
Quite true, your Lordship. The Legislature has talked so long
about the principle of education—has so long debated on the theory
—that it has quite overlooked the practice. To be sure, Parliament
has voted money for the schoolmaster. On one occasion it absolutely
gave 10,000l. for the education of the people; yes, the magnificent
sum of 10,000l. in the very session, if we remember truly, it voted

THE CHURCH IN DANGER.
“MR. PUNCH,
“I am one of the persons who take the twopences at the
door of St. Paul's. I might, I know, have made common cause with
the Whispering Gallery, the Ball and Cross, the Library, and the
Vaults; but I choose to write by myself, representing as I do the
body of the Church. I stand upon my own individual twopence 1
“Well, Sir, I have read in the Standard (and therefore know it can
be no joke) the following disastrous news :-
“‘HER MAJEsty The QUEEN having been graciously pleased to command that for
the future no fee shall be taken from any F. visiting the state apartments at Windsor
Castle, we are authorised to give notice, that from the 1st of January next, in accordance
with regulations issued by the Lord CHAMBERLAIN, tickets for the admission of visitors
to the state apartments may be obtained, gratis.”
“And then follows a list of printsellers, of whom the aforesaid
tickets are to be had.
“HER GRAcious MAJESTY being the head of the Church, it is my
special wish to speak of her with becoming reverence. But, Sir,
when the Church is put in danger, it is my duty, as a subject and a
Church money-taker, to speak out.
“Well, then, is it not plain that if the QUEEN allows her subjects
to see all her state rooms for nothing—if she once gives her people
a taste (I must with all respect say it), a low and vulgar taste for
gratis—is it! not plain, I ask, that folks will refuse to pay to see
St. Paul's and Westminster Abbey
“Consider, Sir, the tremendous influence of HER MAJESTY's high
example. When people can see all the pictures, and all the golden
furniture, and the satins, and velvets, and tapestries of Windsor
Castle for nothing, is it likely that they will out with their twopences
and their testers to see a show at a Cathedral or Abbey Will John
Jon Es and family, having acquired the depraved taste of seeing the
QUEEN’s cabinet gratis, put down ready money for a peep at
NElson's coffin I need scarcely say to you, it isn't in human
nature to do so.
“Foolish, short-sighted people, who can't look deeper than an
inch at most into a millstone, may see nothing in this but at the
most a loss of fees. But I, and my brother money-takers, know that
with the fees are tied up—tight as the strings of a bishop's apron—
the interests of true religion. What people see for nothing, they
soon learn to care nothing for. It is this amazing truth, Sir (it
cannot be otherwise), that has made Deans and Chapters solemn
show-folks. For people to have a true notion of the Ball and Cross
they must pay for 'em. It is this very fact that makes the Bench of
Bishops so very interesting—so very dear to the public. I will
suppose, for instance, that the Bishop of Exet ER hadn't above a
thousand a year. I will suppose him without Bishopstowe, and his
town house, and his carriages, and everything that surrounds him
with a glorious halo of money—they paint the halo about early Saints
after a different fashion;–well, do you think that the ignorant
world would love him, just as they do at the present time, and for
nothing but his humility, and gentleness, and loving-kindness to all
men I fear not.
“Therefore, it behoves the Clergy to be up and stirring – it
behoves the Bishop of LoNDoN and the folks of Westminster
Abbey to look about 'em. The Abbey wax-work is in danger—the
HENRY THE Seventh's Chapel may—so to speak it—be snuffed out
by the QUEEN’s boudoir.
“As I know that the Bench of Bishops, to a man, read your
inestimable pages, I appeal to them through you. Let a meeting of
the Clergy be called immediately; and let a most respectful, but
withal firm address, be voted to HER MAJesty—to be presented by
the Bishop of London—an address praying our Sovereign Lady to
recall her command of gratis; otherwise, there will, there must, be a
speedy termination to the existence of your humble servant,

OUR NATIONAL DEFENCES.
HERE are sometimes entertained doubts
of our being prepared to offer effectual
resistance to a foreign enemy, but it is
refreshing to feel that we are really a
deal more secure than we are oc-
casionally led to imagine. It is only by
a crisis that great facts come out ; and
the Christmas Box crisis has elicited
some very valuable statistics on the sub-
ject of the defences of the Temple, which
* appears to be protected by a phalanx of
force that, considering the size of the
place, must be considered utterly invin-
cible. It will hardly be believed that
a staff of officers night and day is
kept up in the Temple, which, in what
is termed the “war time,” had scarcely
any parallel even in the strong fortified
towns and inland garrisons. The Tem-
plars may sleep over their law-books with
the consciousness that there is a body
* of men taking care of the place, whose
numbers, judging from the long list of
applicants for Christmas-boxes, are suf-
ficient to give them an ascendancy over
all casual enemies.
In the first place, there are two gate-
keepers to open onegate, which is a ways
wide open from morning till night, and
never kept at all as a gate, except during
the night, when, no doubt, two officers
are necessary to guard against surprise
from without, as well as to enable the
gallant fellows to pass a portion of their
time at cribbage before a good fire un-
derneath the gateway. In addition to
these gate-keepers, whose duty it is to die
at their post—the gate-post—though such
a sacrifice has never been required of
them, yet, we have two watchmen who
in case of an attack on the gate, would give the alarm to the whole Temple,
though, by the way, it often happens that a couple of nervous old watch-
men will give the alarm to each other by mutually frightening one another
out of their wits. There is also an efficient corps of under-porters, whose
nominal duty is to take in letters during the day, and sleep during the night;
but who, of course, would be ready in case of an unexpected outbreak.
In addition to these, there are two local troops who sometimes call
themselves beadles, and sometimes warders, from the mixed nature of
their occupation, which is to walk up and down with canes in their hands,
as a terror to little boys, which savours of the beadle, and occasionally to
stand still and gossip, which smacks of the warder. In addition to all
this array of power, the Temple is further guarded by a dustman and a
lamplighter, who, in case of an emergency, would lay down their lives—
that is to say, their lanterns and their dust-baskets—in defence of the
Temple and its liberties.
e are indebted for the discovery of all these statistics to the happy
occurrence of Boxing-day, which has developed the official; force of the
Temple in the fullest manner. We quite approve of this large standing
army being kept up, and cheerfully contributed to its support on the
festive occasion of Christmas; but we should like to suggest that, with
all this power at the di of the Temple, it seems tº:
to allow chambers to be robbed in the way that sometimes happens. We
merely throw this out as a hint for the great standing army of porters,
warders, and beadles to act upon, if they approve of the suggestion.
LEGAL INTELLIGENCE.
It is not generally known that His Royal HighNEss PRINCE ALBERT
was advised to take counsel's opinion on the demand that had been made
upon him for poor-rates in the case of the Flemish Farm. His Royal
Highness's solicitor drew up a case, which was despatched to MR. BRIEF-
less, the Standing Counsel Extraordinary and Deputy Sub-assistant
Attorney-General to the inferior departments of the Royal Household.
The case was endorsed with the words, “Mr. BRIEFLEss, ii. 1s. ; Clerk's
fee (or Christmas Box) 2s. 6d.” A pen had been drawn through the cus-
tomary words “With you,” and “By Younself as usual” had been substi-
tuted in long-primer capitals, which looked to the eye of BRIEFLEss longer
and primer than they had ever done before. The following was the

“A. B. has a farm, and C. D. calls for poor's-rate. Your opinion is
required whether A. B. should pay the poor's-rate or not, and what steps,

After due deliberation, MR. BRIEFLess returned the following opinion,
which does our learned protégé much credit, for it abounds in those beau.
tiful complications that are the life and soul of legal science:—

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE MILITIA MOVEMENT.
HE announcement of the intended calling out of the
Militia has raised a mixed feeling among the people
at large, who are divided, like Desdemona, between
love and duty. Some love the fine regimentals, and
hate the duty; while other, conceiving the duty to
consist chiefly in assen.bling at large fires, and get-
ting a good view of them by being placed in the front
row of a crowd, have no objection to be called into
what they believe to be active service.
Some, who are really of a pacific turn, are run-
ning frantically about, asking what will exempt a man
from serving if he is drawn for the Militia, and a
superstition appears to exist, that a lot of children—
say half-a-dozen—will release an individual from the liability to be called
out on duty as a militia-man. This rumour has created an unhealthy
demand for infants, who are being adopted in all directions by people
who hope to defraud their country of their valour by assuming a paternity
they are not entitled to.
We regret to say that we have consulted the Act of Parliament, and
find the supposed exemption on the score of an enormous family to be a
mere popular error, like the notion that you may eat a cart-load of turnips,
provided you sit down in a field and devour them. . There is a rumour
that MR. Distin and his four sons, the distin-guished horn players, have all
been drawn for the militia; but they declare they will see their trumpets
blowed before they will go.

LINES UPON MY SISTER’s PORTRAIT.
BY THE LORD SOUTHDown.
The castle towers of Bareacres are fair upon the lea,
Where the cliffs of bonny Diddlesex rise up from out the sea:
I stood upon the donjon keep and view'd the country o'er,
I saw the lands of Bareacres for fifty miles or more.
I stood upon the donjon keep—it is a sacred place,
Where floated for eight hundred years the banner of my race';
Argent, a dexter sinople, and gules an azure field,
There ne'er was nobler cognizance on knightly warrior's shield.
The first time England saw the shield 'twas round a Norman neck,
On board a ship from Valery, KING WILLIAM was on deck.
A Norman lance the colours wore, in Hastings' fatal fray—
ST. WILLIBALD for Bareacres 1 'twas double gules that day !
O Heaven and sweet St. WILLIBALD ! in many a battle since
A loyal-hearted BAREACREs has ridden by his Prince 1
At Acre with PLANTAGENET, with Edward at Poitiers,
The pennon of the BAREACREs was foremost on the spears
'Twas pleasant in the battle-shock to hear our war-cry ringing :
O 1 grant me, sweet SAINT WILLIBALD, to listen to such singing !
Three hundred steel-clad gentlemen, we drove the foe before us,
And thirty score of British bows kept twanging to the chorus !
0 knights, my noble ancestors l and shall I never hear
SAINT WILLIBALD for Bareacres through battle ringing clear !
I'd cut me off this strong right hand a single hour to ride,
And strike a blow for Bareacres, my fathers, at your side l
Dash down, dash down, yon Mandolin, beloved sister mine !
Those blushing lips may never sing the glories of our line :
Our ancient castles echo to the clumsy feet of churls,
The spinning Jenny houses in the mansion of our Earls.
Sing not, sing not, my ANGELINE 1 in days so base and vile,
'Twere sinful to be happy, 'twere sacrilege to smile.

THE RICHMOND WAR TRUMP.
A circulah has appeared in the Post, signed by the secretary of
the Agricultural Protection Society, calling a “special meeting of
the aforesaid society,” in the front parlour of No. 17, Old Bond
Street, for the 12th instant. We have every reason to believe that
our much respected man-milliner contemporary has been imposed
upon. We are enabled to give a true copy of the circular in
question.
“ 17, Old Bond Street, London, Dec. 31, 1845.
“SIR,--I am directed by his Grace, the excellent and unflinching
President of the Agricultural Protection Society, to inform you that the
present awful state of affairs requires an early meeting; say, the 12th of
January. You will remember that, on a memorable occasion, his
Grace threatened, on certain provocation being given, to turn out SIR
Robert PEEL. His Grace is quite ready to keep his word ' Backed and
strengthened by the “agricultural mind,” his Grace looks forward to the
place of Premier with the liveliest satisfaction.
“His Grace, however, cannot blind himself to this fact : the
Protection Society is very low in cash It is necessary to knock down
CoBDEN, BRIGHT, and all the lot of the League with a huge money-bag.
Now, all the funds of the Protection Society might, in gold coin, be
comfortably placed in the smallest watch-pocket. In this dilemma, his
Grace calls upon you to come with a cheque for—but he will not dictate
to you : he will merely state the amount that his purse is prepared to
bleed.
“His Grace proposes to head the subscription list with a sum of three
thousand pounds. There is nothing like money to persuade the world
that you are in earnest: no sort of writing so convincing to mankind as
the writing on a bank-note.
“His Grace is also happy to inform you that he has secured the advo-
cacy of his noble relative, Lord WILLIAM LENNox, author of The Tuft-
Hunter, and a distinguished contributor to the Sporting Magazine. His
Lordship has made a most brilliant hit at Chichester, having recited six
lines of verse in favour of the Corn Laws, verse warranted to be his
own. LoRD WILLIAM has promised to attend with a bran-new speech,
culled with his Lordship's well-known taste from fifty other speeches, but
here and there with certain particles altered (after the approved manner
of his Tuft-Hunter), and from this oration Monopoly may look forward
to the greatest support. Yes: LoRD WILLIAM's speech is confidently
expected to be a bulwark against the attacks of the League.
“The proceedings of the 12th will terminate with a grand conflagration
of the Times newspaper—fire, after the manner of the good old days,
being considered the most powerful answer that can be applied to an
opponent. Smithfield, it will be remembered, is rife with such historical
arguments. The burning of the Times went off very well at Chichester:
but to give Monopoly another lift, it is proposed by His Grace that on the
12th, an effigy of the Editor (after the manner of Guy Fawkes) shall also
be devoted to the flames. It is sagaciously believed by the Duke that no
argument can answer argument like this.
*I am, Sir, your obedient Servant,
“HENRY BYRON.
“P.S. Don't forget the cheque.”
FLUCTUATIONS IN THE CAB MARKET.
Though the numerous fluctuations in the Money Market are made the
subject of acute comments in the public journals, we do not remember
having seen any notice of the fluctuations in the Cab Market, which are
upon a very wide and extensive scale. During the gloom that prevailed
for a portion of the past week, HANsom's Patent Safeties without the
coupon—or blind for wet weather—were done at a shilling a mile, and
the reduced fives—or old clarences that will hold five at a cram—were
buoyant at eighteen-pence, with a F. of improvement. Open cabs
during the rain were steady at nothing, and the list shows no transaction.
There was a rush of bears from the Adelphi Theatre, which caused
the Cab Market to assume a very active appearance for a short time;
and fathers of families, with their children, were done at a very high
figure, with a prospect of an advance at the settlement.
White handkerchiefs and polished boots were freely taken at lower
rates than those demanded in the earlier part of the day, when it was
understood that they had made bargains for time, and they were accord-
ingly made to pay for the accommodation somewhat heavily. In one
concern there was a breaking down, and a consequent failure in making the
ºleposits at the time and place appointed. This is the only smash in the
Cab Market that came to our knowledge, and in this the getting out was
ultimately arranged in a satisfactory manner.
ON CE MORE OUR PORT R.A.I.T.
We wished to present a New Year's Gift to all and every of our
readers. We were puzzled what to select that should sufficiently mark
our regard for them, when dear HARRIson AINsworth helped us out of
the dilemma, by suggesting to us that Punch should follow his example,
and give to the world another portrait. Well, we felt that, with Ains.
wonth, we had given ourselves in every way; full-face, profile, three-
quarters. . At length, it struck us that the world had not as yet a correct
portrait of the back of our head. Here then it is:
NOT BY MacLise.
It will be seen that our organ of philoprogenitiveness is very large; a
fact indicating that we take a most prodigious conceit in the children of
our brain. Whether Punch and AINsworth agree in this particular will
be proved next January, when Mr. A. will, as in duty bound, give to the
world a view of his occiput.
Description of A Thin GENTLEMAn.
We overheard the following definition in Tottenham Court Road. The
author of it was a cabman –“I say, BILL, look at that 'ere thin 'un.

HALF A WISH.
SiR Robert PEEL returned to Downing Street just in time for Christmas
Day. In wishing him a Merry Christmas, we wish we could add, “and
many happy returns of the day.”
THE CLASSICAL GERMAN MANIA.
THERE is just now a rage for everything German; and though
we have no objection to the Germanising of shop-boys and lawyer's-
clerks, we cannot tamely submit to see the operation performed upon the
cherished nursery-tales of our infancy. A linendraper's assistant may,
if he pleases, Germanise himself by allowing his hair to hang in greasy
profusion down his back, by which arrangement he not only gives
himself a classical aspect, but saves the various threepences that are
requisite for occasionally getting his hair cut. - -
But while, as we said before, we have no objection to the Germanising

of a gent, we protest against the application of the principle to those
objects which we have garnered up, and put away in our hearts as closely
as the four-and-eightpenny mixed tea in its six-pound packages. We
have caused a few sketches to be made for the purpose of showing what
might be expected if some of our nursery rhymes were illustrated after
the Classico-German style which is at present so popular. Let us take,
for instance, that venerable Mother Hubbard, and see how some of the
most remarkable passages in her career would bear illustration after
the German style of art, which every, one now appears to delight in.
How, for instance, would RETsch—or, as the lovers of simplicity have
styled him, WRETch—how would he have treated, in one of his outlines,
the incident where Mother Hubbard, having “gone to the baker's to
buy him (the dog) some bread,” when she comes back finds that death has |
put a period to his hunger ? We fancy we see Mother Hubbard letting
fall the loaf, brought, alas ! too late ; while the figure of the dog might be
thrown up into frightful relief by the German mode of treatment.
To take another passage from the same fine work, let us look at the
powerful situation in which, after going to the undertaker's to buy him a
coffin, she came back and found him laughing.
We are quite sure that no German artist could render a dog's laugh
with the fidelity that is shown in the annexed engraving. The whole air
that surrounds the dog is riant in the extreme; but we object to the
classicalising of Mother Hubbard in the way in which she is here
depicted.

THE
Thousands of breasts beat horrid hope;
Thousands of eye-balls, lit with hell,
Burnt one way all, to see the rope
Unslacken as the platform fell.
Cove NTRY PATM or E.
WITHIN these few days, the majesty of the law—as the Moloch is
called—has on two occasions asserted itself by the hands of the
hangman. A great moral lesson has been preached to the multitude
—the preachers a dead, law-slaughtered man and woman. MARTHA
BRow NING and SAMUEL QUENNELL–suffocated carcases —have
been hung to a beam to illustrate the sacredness of human life. The
law, to show its horror of the bloodshedder, has shed blood. The
rope and the knife were the death-dealing instruments of the mur-
derers : but the homicides themselves were killed with all the
solemnity of a statute. The first victims were smitten suddenly,
secretly: but the bloodshedders, to expiate their crime, were strangled
for a national sight. Lessons of Christian love and charity were
thought to issue from the dead, distorted mouths of the law-killed
malefactors. The hangman was made the schoolmaster; and the
priest preached the loving-kindness and forgiveness of Chaist to
miserable creatures, to be in an instant slain by the law's revenge.
And there is no mockery in this—none ! In many foolish phases,
under many wicked forms, appears the wonderful knowledge of the
legislature; but if the great Enemy and Mocker of man would show
the fiends the greatest and foulest example of human folly and wick-
edness in the guise of justice, surely he would point to the hanging
carcase of a man, killed according to law, and, with a chuckle, cry,
“Behold, the Wisdom of Parliament 1” True; he may mourn the good
old faggot times, when he snuffed the sweet odour of roasting flesh—of
law-burnt men and women in Smithfield ; nevertheless, there still re-
mains for him neighbouring Newgate; and still Sir James Graham sits
paramount—Justice in granite—at the Home Office What double
lessons of morality did the wisdom of the Secretary set the contem-
plative populace of London last Monday week How cunningly, too,
were the practical themes ordered—that the half-taught of the Old
Bailey might, following the hangman, be completely edified in Horse-
monger-lane I Should Parliament, in its growing tenderness for the
multitude, some day appoint a national Master of the Revels, SIR
JAMEs GRAHAM, above all other claimants, must fill the post. His
unwillingness to deny the mob the execution of MARY FURLEY must
ever be gratefully remembered by the visitors of the Old Bailey.
And there again, thoughtful SiR JAMEs did all he could : he at
least whetted the appetite of the multitude with the sweet death-
warrant; though only eight-and-forty hours afterwards it was re-
called, the woman having suffered only eight-and-forty hours of
needless agony. Nevertheless, it was a fine thought to threaten her,
just in solemn sport, with the hangman—even it may be at the time
it was determined only to expatriate her. Now and then a wise,
benevolent statesman may permit himself to play with heart-strings,
even as NERo played upon the fiddle.
But a great reform has taken place. The press is excluded from
the interior of a prison on killing days. This tremendous sagacity of
SIR. JAMEs will very soon render turnkeys reporters; for somehow
anecdotes of the condemned cell will find their way into print. We
have full evidence of this. For instance, we gather the subjbined
glad tidings from the newspapers:
“In the course of some conversation she (MARTHA Browning) had with the chaplain,
she has expressed an opinion that the spectacle of her being publicly executed would be
calculated to have the effect of preventing others from committing a similar crime, and
there is very little doubt she will meet her dreadful fate with the utmost firmness.”
Now, did the Reverend MR. Davis himself furnish our brethren
with this intelligence On the other hand, did the enlightened
chaplain—the mouth-piece of mercy, as the preacher of the New
Testament—did he himself first suggest such an opinion to the cul-
prit, to be afterwards blazoned as her own penitent conviction We
more than suspect this of MR. Davis; and for this shrewd reason:
we well remember his funeral discourse to Hocker ; in which the
chaplain took it upon himself to answer the opponents of legal man-
slaying, by dilating on the great moral example afforded by public
hanging; it was so awful, so tremendous a lesson to the depraved
and thoughtless.” And can this really and truly be the solemn con-
* In A Plea for the Abolition of Capital Punishment, by the Rev. Ma. Pyns, of Hook,
Surrey, he states, on the authority of the Rev. M. R. Roberts, that in one instance it was
proved that “out of 167 criminals 164 had been themselves spectators of executions."
Yet the Ordinary of Newgate argues for the benefit of hanging, as though it were to the
Ordinary a dear and “vested interest.”
“MORAL LESSON "
OF THE GALLOWS.
viction of MR. Davis, minister of the Gospel 7 And if it be, we ask
of the man, is he blind—is he deaf Has he no perception What—
in the acting of his dreadful functions, when he issues from Newgate
door, what does he see—what hear? Does he behold an awe-stricken
flowing with tears, lips moving with prayer against temptation ?
: Does he listen to a low yet fervent murmur of devotion ? No-no.
He sees around him horrid looks—cannibal eyes, whetted with a
foul appetite, nurtured by the gallows. And he hears a cry of “Hats
off I’” that the public killing of a man or woman may be as fairly
seen by all, as by the expectant gazers of an opening pantomime.
And yet with these sights and sounds—things, we should think, apt
to disturb the rest of holy men—with these horrors acted about him,
MR. Davis translates hanging into a moral example. The dreadful,
curious looks of the Old Bailey, are the looks of penitence—and the
savage oaths of blasphemy are muttered prayers.
But to return to the double horror of Monday week—to a con-
sideration of its moral efficacy. What was the scene in the Old
Bailey on the previous Sunday Let the Globe answer:
“During the whole of the day, a vast number of idle and dissolute girls and boys con-
tinued loitering in front of the prison, uttering the most disgusting and ribald jests.”
Hanging, however, imparts advantages to some people; namely, to
the householders of the Old Bailey; for on the Sunday evening—
“If any respectable person was passing, his ears were assailed with the following ques-
tions by the persons above noticed:—“Do you want a room, sir? A fine view of the
scene, sir. You can have every accommodation and plenty of refreshment already pro-
vided; a good fire, sir, so that you will not feel the cold.’”
And so pass the night with brandy and cigars, awaiting the advent
of the great moral teacher, hangman CALcRAF.T. At an early hour
the mob assembled, and according to the papers, brawled and fought.
The killing at the Old Bailey perpetrated, the Chronicle tells us—
“Soon after the great bulk of the crowd began to disperse, a great portion of whom,
we regret to say, proceeded with great speed to the next sad scene of action at Horse-
monger-lane.”
And thus had the benefit of a twofold moral lesson ; a lesson whose
efficacy was shown in fights at the gallows' foot, and was most im-
| pressively declared by the subjoined paragraph in the same copy of
the Times that narrated the two acted moralities.
| “Guildii All-John Asbury and HENRY Lee, two lads, were committed to Bride-
well for a month for attempting to pick pockets at the execution in the Old Bailey.”
| What says the Reverend Ordinary to this Is it not clear that
the Old Bailey gallows is too often the half-way post to Bridewell—
the seeing a Newgate exhibition merely preparatory to an abiding in
Newgate walls
And now, a final word to Mr. DAvis. We doubt not that he, and
every other gaol chaplain appointed to preach love and mercy to the
culprit while the law waits to kill him, do conscientiously fulfil their
duties: we make no question that they can reconcile together the
function of a minister of the Gospel, who preaches forgiveness, with
the duty of the heathen priest who assisted at the slaying of the
victim. WE cANNot. To hear the peaceful words of the Redeemer
breathed in the ear of a man about to be strangled, is, to our mind,
to listen to a most awful State hypocrisy—a most appalling mock-
ery of the greatest attribute of Jesus. We speak as the ignorant
laity; but we speak our honest thinking. According to our view of
Christianity, it ought to be as difficult in a Christian State to find a
Christian clergyman to assist at the deprivation of human life, as,
thanks to the humane instincts of the common mass, it seems
difficult to obtain a wretched mercenary to do the killing. Is it to
will vindicate their Christianity; and, as one man, petition Parlia-
ment against death-punishment? We throw out this suggestion to
Mr. Davis; let Newgate begin the work. Let the chaplains learn
the lesson set them by the excellent Lond NUGENT at Aylesbury,
and show with him, that even the Bible, which is now made their
great argument for the hangman, does not, truly translated, com-
mand man-slaying. We say again, let the gaol chaplains, with one
accord, lift their voices in solemn condemnation of the barbarous, the
ignorant practice of judicial man-killing; nor will their appeal to the
| wisdom of Parliament be less benevolent, less Christianlike, if
assisted by the dulcet accents of, here and there, a bishop.
| Still, have we this comfort: whether the men of God assist the
goodly work or no, the gallows is doomed, is crumbling, and must
down—overthrown by no greater instruments than a few goose-
quills.

very nearly a natural.
PUNCH*S POLITICAL DIGTIONARY.
AMAGEs. What a man gets by going to
law; and, as the word is derived from
damnum, a loss, it is exceedingly appro-
priate.
DEAD WEIGHT. Wide the National Debt
and other blessings, which are among the
venerable institutions of the country.
DEBENTURE. From the Latin debeo, to
owe. A bill given by Government when
for want of cash it is obliged to have re-
/* course to the Bill System. Debentures
were given to the soldiers for their arrears
of pay in the time of the Commonwealth,
which was a time of common poverty.
DEED. From factum, a thing done; which
is always equivalent to a person done,
when the term is applied to a legal instrument. There are two
kinds of deeds : one called a deed poll, the other an indenture.
A deed poll has only one party, and is cut straight at the top,
or, as it is termed, shaved, as an indication that the client has
experienced some pretty close shaving at the hands of his lawyer.
An indenture is cut out into the form of teeth, being emblematical
of the Law's propensity to show its teeth whenever an opportunity
presents itself.
DEMocracy. A word taken from the Greek language, whence
many of our political terms are derived, which accounts for the
science of political economy being Greek to most people. The third
book of Herodotus attempts a definition of democracy, one of the
essentials of which is said to be the election of magistrates by lot;
and a nice lot of magistrates we should get by such a system.
Another essential to democracy is said to be the decision by the
community at large of all public matters; which would involve the
necessity of a constant succession of monster meetings over the
entire country during the whole session of parliament. If the art
of government were an instinct, or could even be taught, like the
Polka, in three lessons, a democracy might be a very good thing; but
a state in which all are rulers and there is no one to obey, would not
be very eligible. Perhaps the best form of government in which the
whole community could join, is that in which every one learns how
to govern himself before he commences showing his authority over
other people.
DENIzEN is something between an alien and a natural ; a kind
of animal that is, like the mule, neither a horse nor an ass. Perhaps,
however, the denizen rather approaches the latter, for he is certainly
DE posit. A sum of money which one man puts into the hands of
another; a piece of simplicity which, during the railway mania,
became very general. By the Roman law, the refusal to return a
deposit was punished with infamia, or infamy ; and in the present
day there is a good deal of infamous conduct with reference to the
non-return of the deposits.
DEscENTs. The rule of law by which a title goes down from father
to son, or from ancestor to heir ; and the drop-down from one to the
other is sometimes wonderful.
Diplomacy, from the Greek word Strawwa, which signifies any-
thing double; and diplomacy is so called from the duplicity which is
its chief attribute. Some derive the word “diplomacy” from the two
words “dip” and “low,” because it is necessary to dive down into the
depths of people's motives for the purpose of carrying out a diplo-
matic object. Diplomacy is the art by which one nation attempts
to bamboozle another.
THE CLERICAL SHOW.
WE have received numerous letters in reference to the St. Paul's
and Westminster Abbey Exhibitions; and we subjoin a few of these
communications, in order to give publicity, at least, to their writers’
Views.
“To MR. PUNCH.
“SIR,
“My young people are now home for the holidays. I wish very
much to give them and MRs. S. a treat one day; and for that purpose,
think of taking them to St. Paul's. On looking over the “Guide Book”
to the Cathedral, I find the sum total of the price of admission to be
4s. 4d. My wife, three olive-branches, and self, make five persons.
Five times four and fourpence is twenty-one and eightpence. My eldest is
nine years old. Are children under ten admitted to St. Paul's at half-
price I believe that is the case at MADAME Tussaud's.-I am, Sir, &c.,
“WILLIAM SAuxDERs.”
“FRIEND Punch,
“Thou knowest the objection that our people have to taking off
their hats. I went the other day to inspect the interior of Westminster
Abbey. For admission to the tombs I paid sixpence, which I believe
thou wilt think was exactly twenty-four farthings too much. A person
connected with the establishment desired me to take my hat off; and
because I could not conscientiously accede to this request, I was obliged
to leave the place. No prohibition against wearing hats exists at the
Chinese Museum or the Adelaide Gallery. Why, therefore, should it be
enforced at Westminster Abbey show !—Thine verily,
* OBADIAH STIFF.”
“Old Punch ()
“I know you like a cigar—it is a fine thing in cold weather.
St. Paul's is a very cold place. I went there the other day, and paid my
money to go in like a trump. I asked if smoking was allowed, and was
told, ‘No.’ I asked, “Why?' I was answered, “Because it is a Church.' I
said, ‘I don't know what you call a Church, but I don't call a place which
they let you in to see at twopence a head, and show you the sights inside
at sixpence and one shilling each, a Church at all.” Do you? I may
smoke if I choose at the Surrey Zoological : why not at the St. Paul's
Parsonological ? I remain, Old Fellow,
* THOMAS PIPES.”
“MR. PUNCH,
“Not long ago, it being a holiday in the City, and our office being
closed, I took MARY ANN to see St. Paul's, she preferring it to the British
Museum ; worse luck: the latter being free, gratis, for nothing. The
whole concern cost us 8s. 8d. to see, out and out. We found it very hard
work, climbing over that great building; and before we had got half-way,
MARY ANN nearly fainted for want of something. Don't you think that a
few attendants, with apples, oranges, ginger-beer, soda-water, or lemonade,
would be an improvement, and a great accommodation to visitors at
St. Paul's and I would say the same of Westminster Abbey. I men-
tioned this to a fellow-clerk, who told me that a cathedral was not a
theatre; but I can't see the difference whilst you pay for admission to one
as well as the other.—I am, Sir, yours, &c.

Oh Robert bawn, why leave me pining,
Lone waiting here for news from you?
With LEADER now I'm idly dining,
Because I've nothing else to do.
The Whigs were into office creeping,
We hear, to try a brush with you ;
But their nurse, Russell, set them sleeping,
Their sanguine faces turn'd to blue.
Oh Robert bawn, why leave me pining, &c.
The pretty flowers were made to bloom, Bob ;
The pretty moon, to wax and wane;
A tidy wig was made for BRough AM, Bob-
Ah! cruel, was it made in vain :
There’s wicked CAMPBELL at me snarling;
He takes me for a rat, you see :
I wish you'd take me, Robert darling !
Then ratified my hopes would be.
Oh Robert &c.

E still my hagnizing Art 1 I now
am about to hunfoald the dark
payges of the Istry of my life!”
“My frends ! you've seen me
ither 2 in thefullkerear of Fortn,
prawsprus but not hover prowd
of my prawsperraty; not dizzy
though mounted on the haypix
of Good Luck—feasting hall the
great (like the Good Old Heng-
lish Gent in the song, which he
has been my moddle and ig-
sample through life) but not
forgitting the small—No, my
- beayviour to my grammother
at Healing shows that. Igbot her a new donkey cart (what the
French call a cart-blansh) and a handsome set of peggs for anging up
her linning, and treated Huncle Jim to a new shoot of close, which he
ordered in St. Jeames's Street, much to the estonishment of my Snyder
there, namely an ollif-green velvyteen jackit and smalclose, and a crimsn
plush weskoat with glas-buttns. These pints of genarawsaty in my dispo-
sishn I never should have eluded to, but to show that I am naturally of a
noble sort; and have that kind of galliant carridge which is equel to either
good or bad forting.
“What was the substns of my last chapter? In that everythink was
prepayred for my marridge—the consent of the parents of my HANGELINA
was gaynd, the lovely gal herself was ready (as I thought) to be led to
Himing's halter—the trooso was hordered—the wedding dressis were
being phitted hon—a weddinkake weighing half a tunn was a gettn reddy
by Mesuas GUNTER, of Buckley-square; there was such an account for
Shantilly and Honiton laces as would have staggerd hennyboddy (I know
they did the Commissioner when I came hup for my Stiffikit) and has for
Injar-shawls I bawt a dozensich fine ones as never was given away—no
not by His Iness the Injan Prins Juggernaut Tygone. The juils (a pearl
and dimind shoot) were from the extablishmint of Mysuas Stoak and
Morrixºn. The honey-moon I intended to passina continentle excussion,
and was in treaty for the ouse at Halberd-gate (hopsit MR. Mudson's) as
my town-house. I waited to cumclude the putchis untle the Share-Markit
which was rayther deprest (oing I think not so much to the atax of the
misrabble Times, as to the prodidjus flams of the Morning Erald) was
restored to its elthy toan. I wasn't goin to part with scrip which was
20 primmium at 2 or 3; and bein confidnt that the Markit would rally,
had bought very largely for the two or three new accounts.
“This will explane to those unfortnight traydsmen to womb I gayvor-

not my fault if that old screw Lady BAREacREs cabbidged three hundred
yards of lace, and kep back 4 of the biggest diminds and seven of the
largist Injar Shawls—it's not my fault if the tradespeople didnigit their
goods back, and that Lady B. declared they were lost. I began the world
afresh with the close on my back, and thirteen and six in money, con-
cealing nothink, giving upheverythink, Onist and undismayed, and though
beat, with pluck in me still, and ready to begin agin.
“Well—it was the day before that apinted for my Unium. The Ring-
dove steamer was lying at Dover ready to carry us hoff. The Bridle
apartmince had been hordered at Salt Hill, and subsquintly at Balong sur
Mare—the very table cloth was laid for the weddin brexfst in Ill Street,
and the Bride's Right Reverend Huncle, the Lond Bishop of Bullock.
sºuthy, had arrived to sellabrayt our unium. All the papers were full
of it. Crowds of the fashnable world went to see the trooso; and admire the
Carridges in Long Hacre. Our travleng charrat (light bloo lined with
pink satting, and vermillium and good weals) was the hadmaration of all
for quiet ellygns. We were to travel only 4, viz., me, my lady, my vally,
and Many Hºns as famdyshamber to my HANGELINA. Far from oposing
our match, this worthy gal had quite givn into it of late, and laught and
joakt, and enjoyd our plans for the fewterigseedinkly.
“I’d left my lovely Bride very gay the night before—aving a multa-
chewd of bismission, and Stockbrokers & bankers' accounts to settle:
atsettrey at settrey. It was layt befor I got these in border: my sleap
was feavrish, as most mensis when they are going to be marrid or to be

and found as ushle that they became me exeedingly.
“One thing distubbed my mind—two weskts had been sent home A
blush-white satting and gold, and a kinary coloured tabbinet imbridered
in silver;-which should I wear on the hospicious day? This hadgitated
and perplext me a good deal. I detummined to go down to Hill Street
and cumsult the Lady whose wishis were henceforth to be my hallinall;
and wear whichever she phixton.
“There was a great bussel and distubbans in the Hall in Ill Street:

Tricks of the Telegraph.
Last week, the French telegraph made the following announcement :-
“Abd-el-Kader has been taken:"—but it was mentioned that a fog en-
veloped the remainder of the sentence in obscurity. The funds, however,
rose tremendously.
º following day, the sentence being completed, the intelligence ran
thus:
* Abd-el-Kader has been taken with a dreadful cold in his head.”
The funds fell; but the coup had been sufficiently successful for those
who made the telegraph play into the hands of their agents at the Bourse.
A fog in Parisis frequently a great windfall.

The French Minister of Marine has applied for an immense grant for
the improvement of the navy. The French may save their money now,
for we do not see how their navy could have a stronger reinforcement
than the appointment of Lond ELLENBonough as First Lord of the
English Admiralty.

SEA SONGS FOR LORD ELLENBOROUGH.
DIBDIN's songs are said to have done miracles for the British
Navy, by inspiring a love for the sea into the hearts of Englishmen.
What a true benefactor to the country will that poet be who can
infuse into the head of Lond ELLENhonough any knowledge of
that element over which he has been chosen to preside, or the
smallest comprehension of even the rudiments of that service he
has been placed at the head of.
We shall endeavour from time to time to implant into his Lord-
ship's mind, through the medium of the Muse, a proper admiration
for, and some little comprehension of, that glorious pursuit which he
will in future have not to follow, but to lead and to control.
We insert a few specimens of the style in which the Nautical
Lyrics for Lond ELLENBohough will be written. They are of
course adapted to his Lordship's present state of advancement in
the science to which they relate, or, in other words, “to the meanest
capacity,” and are intended to be sung to guitar accompaniments:—
“I MAY be WORTHY-YET.”
WHEN from the tranquil bay of Herne,
I watched the steamer go,
And saw the paddles gently turn
With motion faint and slow ;
I thought, 'tis thus we live and learn
Of things unknown before,
As fortune's paddles take a turn
To some strange distant shore.
And as I watched the fading smoke
Rise upwards from the sea,
I thought “this is a precious joke
To make first Lord of me.”
But never mind, some knowledge slight
I may hereafter get,
And of my new official light
I may be worthy yet.
The son G OF The FiRST Lord of The ADMiralty.
YE mariners of England,
I'll thank you if you please
To come and tell me something of
The service of the seas:
I’ve something heard of horse marines
But nothing do I know ;
Though a trip in a ship
I to India once did go.
If enemies oppose me,
And say I'm very far
From being what I ought to be,
I'll say that others are
So come, brave tars, and teach me
A vessel for to know :
If the heel is the keel—
Or abaft means down below.
Then courage, all you admirals,
And never be dismay'd,
For I'm a bold adventurer,
That never learnt my trade.
Our ministers employme
To vote for them, you know ;
Then be bold, when you’re told
That by interest things go.
Then here’s a health to WELLINGTON,
Who made of me the choice;
And to his worthy colleagues bold,
Who scorn the public voice.
Tell France and tell America
They may begin to crow ;-
While I reign o'er the main
Is the time to strike a blow.
An ETERNAL PLAGUE.
ENGLAND has at last found a nation which can truly sympathise with
her; for Portugal, it seems, labours under the same complaint as herself
—an Income Tax. Let us hope, however, for poor Portugal's sake, that
she has not been wheedled into the tax by any false Premier's vows that |
it is only to last three years.

TAKING POSSESSION.
HE EARL of St. GERMANs has already been taken
º over the Post-office, and introduced to his new
executed inside the Post-office, we would suggest,
to complete His Lordship's postal 'education, that
he be immediately initiated into those duties also
which take place outside St. Martin's-le-Grand.
For this purpose he should be taken to the Charing
Cross office, and witness the length of time a person
has to wait before he can procure a money-order.
We are sure, after his Postmaster-Generalship has
waited in the rain a couple of hours, he will in-
stantly acknowledge the wonderful despatch with
which all matters connected with the Post-office
are transacted. After this we would propose that
: one of the high-mettled racers, belonging to the
celebrated stud, known as Colonel Maberly's Own
should be saddled for the use of His Lordship,
so that he may ride back in triumph to the scene of his future glories
We should like the EARL of St. GERMANs also to go the rounds of one
of the London postmen, merely for one day, and to inquire particularly
| afterwards how much he received for a hard day's labour; but we feel
this would be expecting his lordship to interest himself too much all at
once about his new office. This pleasure had better be reserved for a
fine, frosty day, when the noble Earl will not feel so much the fatiguing
exercise.
Admiralty Intelligence.
LoRD ELLENBoRough had a long interview last week with Mr. T. P.
Cooke, for the purpose of making some inquiries into the
character and habits of the British Seaman. Previous to his
departure, Mr. T. P. CookE danced a naval hornpipe in the
vestibule.
The celebrated poet, BARRY CoRNwall, had an audience of
the First Lord of the Admiralty. It is understood that the
EARL of ELLENBorough was desirous of collecting some in-
formation on the subject of the Sea, the Sea, which was the
subject of a lengthened conversation.
Several dealers in marine stores were presented to the
First Lord of the Admiralty, a few days since, at his official
residence. His Lordship is determined that this branch of the Marine
shall not be any longer neglected.

HOSPITALITY AT FULLIAM.
The Bishop of London keeps up the good old practice of giving an
annual entertainment to the watermen of Fulham, at his episcopal
residence. Of late years, the watermen have been dwindling away one
after the other, through the inroads made by steam, till very few
members of the fraternity remain. In the course of a few more years,
the entertainment of the bishop will have to be given to one solitary
waterman, when he and his Grace of LoNDoN will be compelled to sit
down to a téte-à-tête banquet. As the Jack-in-the-water is likely to be
the last remnant of the once numerous body, we presume that the annual
entertainment will at last come to a friendly mutton-chop between that
official and some future Bishop of London. We must not be under-
stood to speak in ridicule of the custom, which we very much approve,
and only regret that the scope of its application has necessarily become
so limited.
The Dukes.
WE understand that the Duke of Bedford, and one or two other
dukes, are about to petition Hen MAJESTY for leave to lay aside their title
for awhile, and take a plain MR.: the Duke of Norfolk and certain
other Dukes having brought the nominal dignity into such very bad
odour. The Duke of Bedford has already ordered a new card-plate,
simply inscribed—“MR. Russell.”

of a campaign, the one Militia-man—the Soult of the suburbs—the Hero
of Hammersmith—the Blucher of Brook Green—the Kensington NEY,
or the Wormwood Scrubs WELLINGTON.—for by all these honourable ap-
pellations is he already known—this gallant fellow has been taking a
voluntary bivouac. . Though he knows he might have remained comfort-
ably in bed ; though he was fully aware that he might have waited till
glory called him—and glory never calls any one in the time of peace
before half-past seven ; though he was perfectly conscious that there was
not the smallest necessity for a self-victimisation, our own Militia-man—
Punch's own—preferred bivouacking for one night a la Napoleon.
Having pitched his Windsor chair in the centre of Brook Green, and
wrapped his martial mackintosh around him, he sat down to snatch a
brief repose, and to catch a severe cold on the field of Hammersmith.
It may be urged against the one Militia-man, that his bivouac has at
least been premature, and that he might just as well have waited until
the emergency of the time required him to go through this as yet
unnecessary piece of military martyrdom. In his own impressive words,
we leave him to give his own explanation. “No,” said he, “the soldier's
duty must ever be the soldier's pride, and the man who would basely
shrink from a sacrifice because it is not yet required, is unworthy of the
honour of wearing a British epaulette. No sir,” he continued, rising in
vehemence as he spoke, “the man who would refuse to bivouac till he is
compelled, will never be the champion to whom his country may look in the
hour of danger. Go, sir,” he continued, taking an enormous pinch of snuff,
à la GomeRSAL, “Go sir, and tell your proud masters this”—but we did
not wait to hear the remainder of the sentence.

THE TWO INCAPABLES
* onsiden ING that “a little
learning is a dangerous
thing.” SIR. R. PEEL has
displayed great hardihood in
selecting a brace of noble-
men in a state of blessed
ignorance for the situations
of Postmaster-General and
First Lord of the Admi-
ralty. The other day the
EARL or ST.GERMANs was
inaugurated into the duties
of the first-named office, by
being shown over the whole
establishment, and initi-
ated into all its mysteries, from the first putting of a letter into the
post, to its final delivery. His Lordship was very properly afforded
an opportunity of seeing all the arrangements of the office practi-
cally gone through, and personally performing them. It is believed
that he popped a directed envelope into the box at the toy shop in
Fleet-street, rushed in—disguised as a footman—to take it away,
brought it to the chief office, ran round to the inside to receive it,
faced it, sorted it, and threw it off with his own hand, scampered to
the stamping-room, and stamped it, prepared it for being consigned
to the letter-carrier, came in the disguise of that individual—
namely, in his own Windsor uniform with one of his footmen's
hats—and received the self-same letter he had put into the box, then
hurried off to the house to which it was directed, gave a postman's
knock at the door, thrust it into the servant's hand, and dropped ex-
hausted down upon the step, from which he was conveyed to his car-
riage, wrapped in blankets, put to bed, and rubbed with Friar's
Balsam, arquebusade, and other stimulants.
We understand, that, in consequence of the success of the inaugu-
ration of the EARL of St. GERMANs, the same process is to be gone
through with Lord ELLENBoRough, who is thus to be initiated into
the mysteries of the office of the First Lord of the Admiralty. The
plan of instructing him will, however, be somewhat more extensive
than that applied to the Postmaster-General, for the EARL of ELLEN-
Borough's ignorance being more absolute even than that of the EARL
of Sr. GERMANs, it is necessary that the instruction should be in the
former case extremely primary. He is to commence practising with
a toy-boat in the basin near the Nelson column in Trafalgar Square
where the genius loci will, no doubt, have its effect in inspiring the
new First Lord of the Admiralty with sufficient ambition to aid him
in his great undertaking. After he has made himself entirely master
of all the various manoeuvres of luffing, hauling over, and putting
about, in the Trafalgar basin, he will receive from SIR. R. PEEL a
few lessons in sailing with the wind, and tacking. He will then be
taken to Hungerford Stairs, and will be escorted over the Bachelor
to give him some notion of the working of a steam-boat; and will
perform, at least, one voyage in Waterman, No. 6, that most bellige-
rent of boats, to witness the operation of an attempted invasion at the
Pier of Blackfriars. In the course of a few months, he will be shown
a real man-of-war, and it is expected that he will ultimately be as
jºint a First Lord of the Admiralty as any that have preceded
A SCENE AT THE MIDDLESEX SESSIONS.
MR. Sergeant ADAMs begged that the blind might be pulled up. He
had suffered severely from the darkness; he had worn out six eye-glasses
last year, and was not sure that three or four wrong boys had been sent to
Parkhurst, because he could not see the names of the prisoners.
A JURYMAN complained that he could not see the learned counsel.
MR. SERGEANT ADAMs. Very likely not, sir. I have had thirty-five
years' experience in this court, and during all that time I have been sub-
jected to all sorts of annoyances. I don’t blame the Government; but
have a very strong opinion upon the conduct of the County
MR. CLARKson said, when he was a boy, there used to be a game called
blind-man's-buff. Really, the court was so dark that the officer might
turn round three times and catch anybody he ean. He, MR. CLARKson,
hoped that he had never defended the wrong prisoner, because he had not
been able to see his client.
MR. SERGEANT ADAMs said he was sorry to interrupt the learned
counsel ; but really if they went on at that rate, they would never get
through the cases. There were 170 on the day's list, and he had a great
mind to send every one of them to Parkhurst, which he knew would not
hold half of them; but it might bring the authorities to their senses. The
first case was then called on, and the business of the day proceeded with.
THE GREAT CRUMPET CASE.
J. Gallant Exploit. ,
SERGEANT NonTH, 17 N., deserves the thanks of the community for his
valorous efforts to put down the great muffin and crumpet curse, which
has long afflicted Clerkenwell and its vicinity. SERGEANT NonTH, 17 N.,
had long pined for an opportunity of distinguishing himself in a crumpet
crusade; and fortunately, on last Thursday evening, the tinkling of a
small bell afforded the gallant fellow the occasion he had been sigh-
ing for. A juvenile disturber of the public peace, disguised in
respectable clothing, made his appearance suddenly with a bell in his
hand, and uttering the horrible cry of “muffins.” SERGEANT NonTHrushed
forward, staff in hand, and secured the youthful culprit, who was dragged
neck and crop, muffins and crumpets, basket, blanket, and bell, before the
magistrate.
Ma. GREENwood made a very impressive speech, in which he took a
rapid view of the muffin trade from its earliest origin, and indulged in a
vehement denunciation of the cry of “crumpets.” Hethentouched on bells
as a social nuisance, and went into some statistics relative to the curfew,
the dustman's, and lastly the muffin bell. SERGEANT Noarh dwelt, in his
evidence, very strongly on the fact that the boy had rung the bell “for the
purpose of selling crumpets.” And as the criminality lies very much in
the motive with which an act is done, the intention to vend muffins and
crumpets was strongly dwelt upon as a frightful feature in the transaction.
It is not the mere act of ringing the bell that creates the punishable
offence, but ringing the bell with a view to a trade in crumpets subjects
the offender, it seems, to a penalty of five pounds or a month's imprison-
ment.
MR. GREENwood mercifully reduced the penalty to a shilling, when the
boy tendered all he had, which amounted to sixpence; but as justice could
not be satisfied for less than a shilling, the culprit was “removed to the
cell, crying bitterly.” Unfortunately for the cause of justice, its ends
were defeated by a by-stander, who paid the penalty for the urchin, and
thus defeated wholesome retribution of its juvenile sacrifice. If this law-
less by-stander had not been at hand, the atrocious crumpet-seller would
have expiated his crime by a month's imprisonment.
PEACE AND QUIETNESS.
THE Gresham lectures have already commenced. We announce this
for the sake of those gentlemen, who, having business of a private nature
to discuss, are sure of a retired spot where they can talk it over among
themselves, without any fear of disturbance. There is always a good fire,
and nothing charged for the room. Enquire of the beadle of the Royal
Exchange between the hours of 1 and 2.
PLAYING AT SOLDIERs.
It is rumoured that the Militia is being organised with the charitable
purpose of allowing a certain martial Prince the opportunity of rehearsing
the very difficult character of Commander-in-Chief.

POLITICAL RAILWAYS.
‘. . --
Legislation has now become such a hash of politics and railways, that
it is difficult to think of one unconnected with the other; and both are, in
a manner, jumbled up together in the public head." Associated thus with
politics, railways have been rendered political ; and we may now, in fact,
without talking nonsense, venture to talk of political railways. We may
even go so far as to affirm that the following competing lines of political
railway.will come under consideration in the approaching session of
Parliament:— - n -
The Great Conservative Line—Chairman, SIR Robert PEEL, stands first
on the list, and perhaps, may. be regarded as A 1. ... This line has
a large number of supporters; but still there is considerable doubt
as to whether or not it will eventually pass. At present it may be looked
upon as only being provisionally, registered, with reference, at least
to the good graces of the landowners and farmer's friends, the generality
of the Bishops, and the majority of the parsonocracy at large. The pro-
ceedings of its Directors, too, are such, that very many of its shareholders
and subscribers are anything but satisfied with them.
This, line will be supported by many who were interested in the old
Tory, turnpike road, though numbers of those persons who will be ruined
by its establishment will prefer having nothing to do with it.
The opposing line to this will be the Grand Whig-Radical Junction
Line, with Lord JoHN Russell at the head of its management. The
Whig-Radical Junction will have many advocates out of the House, in
consequence of its promising to go further than the Conservative.
That these lines will be sanctioned by the existing Parliament is hardly
to be expected ; but there is no knowing what future Parliaments may
do. Indeed, it is impossible to say what terminus may, in the end, be
selected even by PEEL. The Russell trains might go faster—and this may
be an accommodation to the public ; but still “slow and sure” is a
maxim worth minding, and it must never be forgotten that it is the pace
that kills.
THE CIVIC COHORTS.
IN consequence of the contemplated calling out of the Militia, a Court
of Lieutenancy has been held at Guildhall, to arrange the reorganisation of
the Cockney cohorts. We did not imagine that an excess of valour would
be found to pervade the breasts of the citizens, but such is their military
valour, that “some members of the Court of Lieutenancy, who, in conse-

quence of physical debility, are wholly incapacitated from performing the
most insignificant duties, show great reluctance to resign.” What is to
be done with these civic legions, these fine old Cockney veterans, who
cling to their arms as long as they have got a leg to stand upon There
is a talk of “striking them off the list,” as incapable and refractory; but
surely their valour deserves a better fate, and it would be only a graceful
homagetotheir warlike spirit, if they were enrolled into companies according
to the various kinds of ailments which have reduced them to their present
state of physical debility. A corps of heavy lumbagos might be formed
with advantage, as a sort of stationary troop ; and a company of gouty
cavalry could take it in turn with a troop of light rheumatics, to act as a
kind of army of occupation for the interior of the Mansion House. -
We had some difficulty at first in discovering what the magnet could be
which attracted the citizens to the Militia; but we find the secret to con-
sist in a certain annual dinner which is given to the officers. There is no
doubt, that if the old incapables could be drafted off into a phalanx of
independent beef-eaters, with the privilege of dining twice a year instead
of once, they would soon be induced to retire from all service but the
dinner service. -

INTRODUCTION.
EN 'o'clock. Ten, P. M., by
the parish church; and ere
we shall have written this
first paragraph, MRs. BIB's
Baby will be one month
old. It has almost been
through the Fishes without
knowing it. Unconscious
little JonAH !
Without , knowing it !
Indeed who shall say?
You may have forgotten
all about it, reader; but
for our part, with all res-
pect for your opinion—and
you may take just as much
of the quality as you hon-
estly think your opinion
worth—for our part, we
are not callous enough to
swear that we had not, the
liveliest and minutest
knowledge of every matter
that passed about us during
the first four weeks of our
citizenship of this world.
Does not a philosopher
avow that the soul of every
baby is, at its birth, wrapt
in a sheet of blank paper,
—like a Maintenon cutlett Well, who shall define the exact
moment when the said baby begins to take notes t—the precise point
of time when baby discriminates the nose of Father from the nose
of Mother?—at what instant a judge between the Roman and, it
may be, the pug
We speak not from conceit. We would arrogate to ourself no-
thing superior, when we avow—and with quite as much gravity as
though we talked to a bishop—that we were perfectly conscious of
all that, in our first month of human breath, looked and stirred, and
sounded about us. It may not be readily believed, but really and
truly, we were a remarkably quiet baby. We had a grave—a
somewhat wan, and contemplative spirit. We remember catching
the first glance of ourself in the looking-glass. We were not flattered
by the reflection. We were somewhat withered, shrunken; as
though a little fagged upon our journey into this world. We can well
remember the ancient woman who—when we were six-and-thirty
hours old—remarked that we were “wonderfully like BILLY PITT.”
We have since seen the portrait of the man, and can forgive even
that woman Perhaps, indeed, we have alingering touch of vanity—
a wish that that woman was still alive : that we might confound
her with our present Grecian nose and hyacinthine curls.
We well remember our first impressions of this world. We
thought it a dull, cold, shabby place. We had a feeling that some-
how it was nothing like the place we had come from. It seemed to
us that there lingered in our brain little flecks and dots of light,
which, though they grew fainter and fainter, still made all other
things about us look dim and cold. It somehow seemed to us as
though we had fallen asleep, and had awakened disgraced. Of
course, this could not be; but we give our impressions.
We very soon turned author, or rather note-taker. When we
were not above a quarter of an hour old, we felt contempt, pity, yes,
and ire for our nurse. . How she rolled us up ! The ignorant crea-
ture thought we only cried. Little did she know with what abdo-
minal energy at that moment we swore at her I It was wrong; but
we know what we felt. Consider; a tender piece of Adam's clay
swathed and swathed, that even the very heart of a baby is not per-
mitted to throb and bound, but is made to lie as still as a frog in a
stone. If we have hard hearts in the world, who shall say how much
of their hardness they owe to hard nursing
E |E'S E A E Y.
looked about us, and, without saying anything, have made capital
jokes to ourself, laughing enjoyingly but silently at their tremendous
humour. In these moments, the nurse has said—“Poor thing it's
wind " Yes : we have been full of frolic, and such the cold, depre-
ciatory comment. However, in our later days, with our very best
fancies, we have sometimes met with no better interpretation.
Hence, it is a conviction of the great injustice suffered by millions
of babies—it is a profound and stirring sympathy for the wrongs of
their tops-and-bottoms life—that, as with an arm of steel, has fixed
us in our chair, so that we may render up the secrets of an infant soul
to the foolscap spread to receive them. Yes; it is our solemn pur-
pose to give the biography of Mas. BIB's Baby while in arms. We
shall minutely narrate the various persecutions it endured until the
momentous period when it was first enabled to achieve the dignified
posture of Adam, when rising from the bosom of his mother, he
walked as walked the angels. In plain, working-day phrase, Mrs.
BIB's Baby will leave the reader the very moment it runs alone.
How we have become the depositary of Baby's precious secrets, it
matters not in the present page to tell. When the whole book is
completed, the reader may be informed thereof—and he may not.
Our great difficulty will be to reduce our materials into a modest,
volumable compass. We have matter enough for two thick folios of
the good old times, when an author stretched himself in his page as
in a bed—when he had one ; and was not, as in these days, cramped
head to heel, in twelvemo-duodecimo. If the reader will but think
a moment—will but reflect on the manifold sufferings and dis-
quietudes of a baby that, for the first twelvemonth, is rarely
considered other than a doll that cries, and sucks, and eats—the
said baby's germinating opinions being either contemptuously
neglected, or tyrannously oppressed—if the reader will but take to
heart these daily doings suffered by a plastic, ductile creature, at the
very time it should receive most reverential care, he must, without
pause, acknowledge that we have a mass of matter that needs the
most delicate handling. We shall, however, do with the twelve-
month's history of Baby, what Mas. BIB—good thrifty woman —
did with Baby's garments: we shall cut away all flowing super-
fluities; and so reduce the needless longs into succinct shorts.
For the reader must remember that we have the various wisdom of
father and mother—and grandfather and grandmother on both sides
—and godfathers and godmothers—and nurses, and bosom friends,
and kind acquaintance,—all of whom are apt to consider a baby as
a thing sent into a house to provoke and suffer moral experiments,
we say the reader must remember that we have to chronicle all
the many-coloured thoughts of these many people, and he must
therefore indulgently consider the difficulty of our task; for we
must at once be brief yet full, like a wren's egg.
From a painful consideration of the early sufferings of Baby Bin
—to say nothing of our own personal recollections—we are pro-
foundly convinced that the first year of a child's life is the most tre-
mendously important of any succeeding twelvemonth, though the
creature shall number three-score and ten. It is, therefore, with
more than ten tin-trumpet voice, we would preach the very earliest
respect for the very earliest babies. Consider the blank sheet of
paper with which the head of every baby—according to the philoso-
pher—is lined. Think of it, and shudder, when you see nurses and
nurse-maids writing their pot-hooks and hangers upon it, as though
they wrote with rolling-pins, or, at the best, wooden skewers 1 Poor
human papyrus ! How many after-scratchings, and cuttle-fish rub-
bings it shall take to scratch and rub out the marks,—that, after all,
may never wholly be effaced, but remain dingy and dark under
snow-white hairs 1

believe in the solemn nature and destination of that little cloud-

rance as void of thought as any one of the turnips that, with broth

PUNCHPS POLITICAL DICTIONARY.
Iwan. A Persian word for a Senate, and
an English word for a smoking-room.
The Diwan subsequently came to sig-
nify the place of meeting as well as
the people in it—the room as well as
\ the company. In England, being
without the Persian company, we are
only able to adopt the room. Admis-
sion to the Diwan is very difficult in
the East, but it can be accomplished
for a shilling, which includes a cup
of coffee, in the Strand.
Docton. One who has taken the
high degree in any of the learned pro-
fessions, but it is not necessary that he should be in the highest
degree fit for the rank assumed. A doctor, means literally, one who
is able to teach, but it by no means follows that he has been effi-
ciently taught. The qualification for a Doctor's degree in music is
the composition and performance of a solemn piece on any instrument
whatever, and it would seem that a dirge for the double drums would
be sufficient to constitute a Mus. Doc. at Oxford or Cambridge.
Doctors of Physic are not made by prescription, though there can be
no doubt that they ought to be.
DomicILE. The place where every man is when he's at home.
When, however, you drop in at a friend's house to dinner, and he
tells you to make yourself at home, his residence is not your legal
domicile. A married man's domicile is generally considered to be
the place where his family resides; and it does not seem that it
makes any legal difference if he
“Won't go home till morning,
Till daylight does appear.”
DowAGER. A widow entitled to Dower, so that if Mas. BRow N,
the green-grocer's wife, has a dowry, she is, after the death of her
husband, the Dowage R. Mas. Bnown. It is said that a man
may not marry a Queen Dowager without a license from the
Sovereign, under pain of forfeiting his lands and goods; but if he
is a mere adventurer, without either lands or goods, the pain of
forfeiture would not be very acute or violent.
Duke. The title formerly given to the utmost height of English
aristocracy, but lately rendered synonymous with the height of
absurdity. The word Duke is derived from Duz or Ducks; but
Geese would be more appropriate to many modern instances. It
has been said that some Dukes are pudding-headed, and the
present head of the house of Howard resembles, in some of its
qualities, a Norfolk dumpling. Only four families were advanced to
the honour of dukedom in 100 years, which seems to show that
Dukes ought to be made as scarce as possible.
SHAMEFUL CASE OF SACRILEGE,
A Few days since, an abandoned creature, in the human form, entered
Westminster Abbey—under the pretext of seeing the show—and abso-
lutely passed off a bad sixpence upon one of the vergers.
RICHMOND IN SUSSEX.
WE are requested—we shall not say by whom—to fill a gap that,
we know not wherefore, occurs in all the reports of the DUKE of
Richmond's speech in Sussex. His Grace is talking about “honest
men.”
“* * * There were many honest men in the county—in fact, he
would not trust himself to say how many honest men there were,
quite fit and ready to be Prime Minister of England. Cabinet-
making was put forth as a very difficult business. Now he knew
that Cabinet Ministers might be made as readily as blocks at Wool-
wich,--he would not say how many in a minute. The only thing
required to be worked up in the construction of a Cabinet was
honesty. And when he considered the immense quantity of the
raw material abounding in the Agricultural districts—the more
especially in the county of Sussex—(loud cheers)—he felt sure that
we might even become an exporting country in the commodity. Of
course, he was not of such benighted intellect as to expect to find
the smallest portion of honesty in any manufacturing town. Man-
chester, Leeds, Birmingham, and the like, had not one honest man,
woman, or child, among them. Honesty, like buttercups and
daisies, was only to be found in the green fields, flourishing under a
blue sky, undefiled by the black, pestilential vapours, vomited by
tall factory chimneys. (Very loud cheers.) If, then, an agricultural
labourer must, by his nature, be of such unswerving integrity, what
must an agricultural Duke be? He would say no more;—but this he
would say: he believed himself to be a remarkably honest man ;
and this, too, he would also add ; that he would hold himself ready
to start, by special train, to Windsor, whenever it should please the
wisdom of HER GRAcious MAJESTY to send for him.”
A CORN-LAW RHYME.
Awake to your duties, ye sons of the soil,
So handsomely paid for such moderate toil;
Seven shillings a week your slight labours requite,
For remember you work but from morning to night.
Awake to your duties, a foe is at hand,
A foe to your masters, the lords of the land:
The corn-laws are threaten’d—and if they should go,
Why the rents of the squares must be lower'd you know.
Consider, a moment, the landlord's distress,
Doom'd to drink, after dinner, one bottle the less;
A hunter, a carriage or so, to put down,
Or his lady's small wardrobe to stint of a gown.
Oh! believe not the tales that his enemies tell;
The landowner uses the labourer well ;
Don't you eat beef and mutton each day of the year,
And have you not always got plenty of beer?
When aged, and able to labour no more,
Is there not an asylum provided the poor—
A Union where matron and beadle unite
To render life's sunset calm, pleasant, and bright
By º happy, contented, fat children and wives,
Well clothed and well fed every day of their lives,
Stand ye up in behalf of the Landowners' cause,
And their incomes protect from the Leaguers' fell claws.
By your bread and potatoes, your beer and your beef,
By the workhouse, by in-door and out-door relief,
Oh, my hearties and bucks 1 rally round and defend
The landlord—the farmer's and labourer's friendl
PINAFORE PATRIOTS.
At the Repeal Association, a Mr. M'Keon melted the hearts of his
hearers into buttermilk, by assuring them that he had, a day or two
before, given his—
“little son and daughter a half-sovereign, and on presenting it to them they
exclaimed, “Pa (laughter), do give it to the repeal" (cheers). Sir, when I see the
feeling of my little progeny—I hope, by the bye, they will increase and multiply for
their country's cause-I do hope much for Ireland.”
For our part, we did hope much against Repeal,—but there is now no
doubt of the ultimate separation of Ireland from England, cut off, as she
must be, by the half-sovereign of MasTER and Miss M'KEoN 1

THIs is, perhaps, one of the most extraordinary localities of modern times, for, though
standing in the centre of a great city, at the top of a crowded thoroughfare, it has remained to
this day a mystery, of which no one, except the horse of GeoRGE THE FourTH's Statue, can
make either head or tail. The base of the Nelson column is a sealed book, strongly done up in
boards.
If the Commissioners have exhibited a defiance of public feeling, it has not been an open
defiance at any rate. By the constant hoarding up, we naturally presumed that the Commis-
sioners really had something to hoard, some exquisite treasure too delicate for the vulgar eye,
or some wealth too tempting to the light-fingered hand. Werepaired, therefore, to the spot, a
day or two ago, with the determination to unravel the mystery. We chose an early hour in the
morning, and went round to the side opposite to that on which the policeman stood, that police-
man who looks up admiringly at the statue of NRLson, and fancies he hears the memorable
words, “England expects that every man” (including every policeman, of course,) “this day
will do his duty.” -
We dodged the zealous official, and giving a vigorous leap, succeeded in placing our hands on
the top of the hoarding, in the full expectation of looking down upon, as we hinted above, a
mass of hoarded wealth. What however was our disappointment to behold the thistle and the
dandelion springing up luxuriantly among the grass that time had permitted to grow. The reader
may judge how we were nettled when a certain herb of stinging qualities came into contact
with the tip of our nose. While we looked, we fell into a strain of philosophy in which it is
our delight to indulge.
If we recoil from such very hard study as that of “Sermons in stones,” we have a fine relish
for “books in the running brooks,” which are very preferable to the excessively dry reading
we now and then have to encounter. Indulging our love for philosophy, we commenced
mentally conjecturing what could be the meaning of the prospect before us, when suddenly it
occurred to us to be emblematical of the sepulchre of England's naval greatness. “Ah!”
thought we, while imagination drew a full-length portrait, which we soon squared to our own,
melancholy frame of mind:—“Ah,” said we to ourselves, “there is the figure of Britannia
mourning over the widowhood she has sustained in the loss of NELson, to whom she was wedded
before the altar of national glory. Yes, yes, and those nettles—those thistles are all keeping
up the allegory, as the showman once observed—Yes, they are emblematical of the fact
that Britannia, the disconsolate widow, has literally gone into weeds!” At this stern and
Sterne-like conclusion we had just arrived, when we received a tap from that pink of polite-
ness, the Policeman—if anything can be called the pink when it is perfectly blue—who observed,
in atone of sorrow rather than of anger: “Come, sir, this is against the orders—you mustmove
on, if you please.” We were so rivetted to the spot, that we did not stir, when he pulled us
down and conducted us away from the hoarding. We need not say that we went away,
powerfully moved.

YOUNG ROGUE'S CORRECTOR.
A correspondence has lately taken place between
SIR JAMEs GRAHAM and MR. Senueant Adams, on
the subject of the Punishment of Juvenile Offend-
ers, which, it seems, is a hard one to grapple
with ; but perhaps we may solve the difficulty.
The juvenile offender may, for a slight trans-
gression, be placed in a corner, with his face to
the wall. This, perhaps, the corner being a warm
one, may not be a too heavy punishment for ring-
ing a muffin-bell.
He may becaused to stand for a certain short
time on a stoolin public, with a bit of bread in the
one hand, and a slice of cheese or bacon in the
other, which he shall not be allowed to eat until
he pleases. Such would be an appropriate inflic-
|tion for begging in the streets from destitution.
For graver offences he may be subjected to im-
|prisonment. Boys from seven to ten years of age,
guilty of striking out slides, or trundling hoops
about the streets, might be sent to some charity.
school, and “kept in" during play-hours.
For picking pockets, and for larceny, committed
for want of knowing better, the same penalty may
be inflicted, coupled with a heavy imposition, to
consist of the whole of the Church Catechism, and
a selection from the Statute Book; which, though
a severe, may be a salutary punishment for crime
perpetrated from mere ignorance. Should this
mode of correcting juvenile delinquency be adopted,
the following variation of a popular couplet may
perhaps supersede the original: –
“He who steals, will, when he's caught,
Be sent to School, and better taught.”

AFTER all, it cannot be a very enviable post,--that of Emperor
of Russia, as at present filled by the magnificent potentate. His
Imperial Greatness must, occasionally, be terribly flustered by his
dignity. Suspicion must be to him a continual body-guard. Of this
pleasing truth we read the strongest evidence in a letter from Venice,
quoted in the Constitutionnel. We are told that “on his arrival at
Padua, he himself visited the apartment in which he was to sleep,
striking the walls with a hammer,” lest, we presume, two or three
Poles should, be concealed behind the wainscot, , ready to pay a
midnight visit to the benefactor of their country. He “then caused
the mattresses of the bed to be removed,” lest they should have been
crammed with combustibles, to explode upon the imperial pressure—
“ and replaced by a leather mattress, which was filled”—with roses 1
asks the reader; no—“with hay under his eyes 1” - And then catch
his Magnificence taking bite or sup, for fear of ratsbane. No : “he
refused to taste any of the dishes prepared for his supper, and called
for his travelling case, out of which he took a bottle of Malaga wine,
and a cold roast fowl, which he shared with Count ORLoff.”
Whether the Emperor had previously drawn and superintended the
roasting of the fowl himself, is not stated: nevertheless, it would not
make a bad ideal subject for the picture gallery of St. Petersburgh,
to have Nicholas, the father of his country, duly limned for posterity,
—with one eye watching the spit, and the other fixed on a new
ukase about to be issued against the Russian Catholics and Jews.
When he went to the opera at Venice, “he remained in the bottom
of the box, and could scarcely be seen. Count ORLorf sat in the
front, attired in a rich uniform”—that the bullets, if any should be
fired, might be officially delivered through that officer. The play
being over, four carriages drove up to the gate; “but nobody could
tell which was the one intended for the Emperor.”
It is thus clear that NICHOLAs has, in his own mind, insured him-
self as doubly hazardous. In the Gesta Romanorum, there is a story
of a beautiful girl who was fed upon serpents, and then sent to a
certain tyrant. She kissed him, and “venom did its work;” the
tyrant died. Nicholas has, assuredly, never read the story, other-
wise he would never present his hand—“his red right hand”—to
the lips of any of his loving subjects.
Just Published,
A staiking pen-and-ink portrait of the Right Honourable the EARL GREY.
It is executed in the line manner, and the likeness reputed to be admirable.
The shadows could not be deeper, and some of the strokes of the pen are
remarkable for their boldness. For a proof before letters, apply to T. B.
Macaulay, Designer in general, at 1, Albany, (lately removed from Down-
ing Street,) where a variety of portraits are always kept on hand. Mem-
bers of Parliament taken off at the shortest notice.
THE QUEEN'S SPEECH.
BEING desirous of procuring an early copy of this interesting document,
we despatched a private note to SIR. R. PEEL, requesting him to favour us
with the speech, as we are compelled to go to press before it will be deli-
vered, in the ordinary course, by HER MAJESTY. The PREMIER has not
answered our letter, and we can only conclude that in consequence of the
EARL of ST.GERMANs being new to his place, there has been some mis-
take at the Post Office, which has caused our communication to miscarry.
We have had better luck with the DUKE of WELLING TON, unless the fol-
lowing is a hoax, which is not at all impossible :-
: “F.M. the Duke of WELLINGTON would be happy to oblige Mr. Punch
with a copy of the speech; but the fact is, the Ministers have not yet
agreed upon the contents; and F.M. the DUKE of WELLINGron sees no
likelihood at present of their doing so. F.M. the Duke has had a good
deal of experience in the disagreements of Cabinets on the subject of
Royal speeches; but he never remembers such a mess as the present.
* F.M. the DUKE of WELLINGTON will let Mr. Punch have the
earliest intimation of anything definite having been come to.”
As we have not heard from His Grace up to the time of our number
going to press, we can only presume that the Ministers were, up to the
very last moment, at loggerheads.
THE LAST new POLK.E.R.
MR. Polk would persuade us that the annexation of Texasis by special
desire of the people of that state. The defence is ingenious, but not
original, being manifestly copied from the following lines in BonRow's
“Gipsies of Spain:”—
“There runs a swine down yonder hill
As fast as e'er he can, -
And as he runs he crieth still,
2 ºx ---
* Come steal me Gipsy man. -
Approaching Water Parties.
ELLENBoRough's first Naval exploit will be to command a squadron in
order to capture the Pillars of Hercules—which he has been told will
match admirably with his Gates of Somnauth. His next expedition will
be a voyage to the North Pole, which he has promised posterity to bring
to England, and plant on the summit of Primrose Hill. If he should ac-
complish this great achievement, prizes will be distributed every year to
the boy who climbs to the top of the North Pole, after it has been pro-
perly greased. The prizes will be appointments at the Admiralty, or else
the command of a man at war.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 49
THE POLITICAL CAMELEON.
Orr has it been my lot to see
As great a fool as fool could be,
Attending meetings, with a shout,
That’t would be better PEEL were out;
While others noisily maintain
They're glad that he is in again.
One would at once refuse submission,
And one would bow to his decision.
Two politicians, each inclin'd,
To be of quite a different mind
Began to have a quiet chat
On sometimes this, and sometimes that,
Discours'd awhile, with earnest zeal,
About that bold Cameleon, PEEL,
And very energetic grew
Upon the subject of his hue.
“A stranger animal,” cries one,
*Sure never bask'd in fortune's sun :
A Tory's body, slow and long,
A landlord's head—Free-trader's tongue;
Its heart to quick repeal inclined,
But for its length of tail behind,
Which checks its pace: and then its hue,
Did anything eer look so blue?”
“Hold, there !” the other quick replies,
“He’s green : I saw it with these eyes,
As late upon the ground he lay,
Thrown over in the oddest way;
Resigned—without a cause I mean—
Could anything be half so green f"
“I’ve seen him, sir, as well as you :
I tell you that he look'd quite blue,
When he awhile was in the shade,
And I, John Russell, progress made.”
“'Twas green, sir; green, sir, I assure ye.”
“Blue !” cries the other, in a fury.
So high at last the contest rose,
They very nearly came to blows;
When luckily they spied a third :
To him the matter they referr'd,
And begg’d he'd tell them if he knew
Whether the PEEL was green or blue.
“Sirs,” cried the umpire, “cease your pother;
He's really neither one nort'other.
I saw the animal one night,
Viewed by the House of Commons light:
I marked him well—I can't forget,
For then he seemed as black as jet.
You stare, my friends !” “Indeed we do.”
“'Tis green.”—“"Tis black "-"Nonsense I 'tis blue.”
|THAT by reason of the misconduct, negligence, and inebristy of divers and
“Suppose, as we are all in doubt,”
Cries one, “at once we turn him out.”
Before they'd time to do it quite,
The PEEL appeared—and lo’twas white :
All stared—and all looked wondrous wise.
“My friends,” the sleek Cameleon cries,
“You all are right and all are wrong,
I'm all by turns, and nothing long.
'Tis just according to the view,
That I am black, or green, or blue.
I but reflect each passing ray
That seems the brightest for the day;
And friends, I hold it no disgrace
To suit my colour to my place.”
PETITION TO ExIn G. E.U.Dson.
TO HIS MAJESTY, HUDSON I., KING OF THE RAILWAYS.
May it please your MAJESTY. The Prayer of your
Petitioner humbly showeth: *
sundry Stokers, Engineers, Policemen, and others, your MAJESTY's
servants, various and several collisions, explosions, and over-
settings, are continually taking place on the Railways, your MA-
JEstr's dominions. - g
THAT by such collisions and other accidents, many serious fractures and
dislocations of skulls, necks, legs, and arms, often invol loss of
life; not to mention contusions, bumps, bruises, and the like inju-
ries, very grievous to endure; do constantly happen to Travellers in
the said dominions of your Majesty.
THAT further, owing to the mismanagement of certain of your MAJESTY's
Ministers, Directors df your Railways, Engines, improperly con-
structed, are allowed to travel at an unsafe speed, on some of the
said Railways, the Highways of your MAJESTY, so to speak; inso-
much that your Petitioner has been informed, and verily believes,
that one MAJoR-GENERAL PAsley did lately ride and travel on one of
the said engines, which “rolled like a ship at sea.”
THAT your Petitioner, besides the usual complement of legs, arms, and
other bodily proportions, has likewise a hump upon his shoulders,
whereof he is very tender.
That through the above-mentioned misconduct and mismanagement of
your Majesty's Officers aforesaid, your Petitioner can never travel
in your MAJESTY's dominions but in bodily fear and trembling for his
life, and for the safety and integrity of his said hump, and other
limbs and members to him belonging.
Your Petitioner, therefore, doth humbly pray that your MAJESTY will
forthwith take such measures as to your wisdom may seem fit, for
causing and compelling such Stokers, Engineers, Policemen, and
Directors, your Majesty's Officers and Servants, each and all in their
several capacities, to look sharp, be alive, and mind what they are
• about, to the end that by their carelessness and negligence the lives
and limbs of your Petitioner, and of the Public at large, may no
longer be jº. and endangered. And your Petitioner, as in
duty bound, will ever pray, &c. -

Sussex Arcadians.
The Duke of Richmond ought to have lived in the golden days of
VIRGIL's shepherds. Their guilelessness would have harmoniously accorded
with the ducal mind. Nevertheless, the swains of Sussex are not all
unworthy of the “Georgics.” Such creatures still exist, albeit this hard-
dealing, money-changing world, may doubt the pleasing verity. , His
Grace of Richmond, too, has recently expressed his determination to keep
his Sussex STREPHons in all their primitive purity. He has installed
himself the custos morum of the rural population of the county, declaring
that he would “not send the agricultural labourers, whose integrity he
knew to be great, to be debauched in Manchester or Leeds.” It is
especially kind of his Grace thus sedulously to guard the integrity of the
labourers. It is very kind of him to think of their souls; nevertheless,
let him listen to the voices of Goatacre, and remember that labourers
have also bellies. But no. Probitas laudaturet-alget.
The CAP WILL FIT.
In consequence of the recent displays of wisdom on the part of certain
Dukes, it has been proposed, in Dame-schools, to substitute the Ducal |
Coronet for the Dunce's Cap.

CHARLEs THE FIRst on to the shoulders of CHARLEs THE Second. We understand that the
favourite Ministerial game during the Christmas holidays has consisted in a Political Puzzle,
occasioned by the breaking up of the party which, until lately, exhibited a firm and compact
appearance. WELLINgtoN and PEEL have taxed their ingenuity day after day in endeavouring
to adjust the Puzzle and place the different persons into the places to which they are fitted.
The effort has however been very futile, and it is to be feared
bungling business of it. Considerable difficulty was occasioned by not knowing what to do with
LoRD ELLENBonough. PEEL insisted that he did not belong to
declared resolutely, that a place must and should be found for him. Perl, very reluctantly found
room for him, but exclaimed petulantly, “Well—I know the introduction of ELLENhonough
will throw us out altogether. We tried him before, and he made everything come wrong.” The
Duke was however obstinate, and ELLENBorough was poked in,
knew the consequence would be that the Cabinet Puzzle would never get completely adjusted.

MORALS OF TRADE.
| ONE ALFRED Leonard—a miserable
felon!—was a day or two since charged
with robbing a worthy tradesman,
named BINGLEY, of Pentonville, of a
saucepan, value 4}d. The audacious
ruffian confessed his guilt. Indeed the
saucepan and label were found upon
him.
“Mr. GREEN wood (to the prosecutor): Read
that label.
The prosecutor did so, aloud.
º Ms. Garºnwood: You have not read it all.
Read on.
The prosecutor read a part ofthe label describing
the article as made of block tin.
MR. Gasanwood: That is untrue, and you
know it.
Prosecutor: Yes, that is untrue.
Mr. Grizºnwood : Then why do you represent
an article to be what it is not?
Prosecutor: We are obliged to tell the public so.
Ma. Garznwood: Indeed you are not obliged
to do anything of the sort, and it is not the part
of a respectable tradesman.
- Prosecutor: We tell our customers so, but if they
ask us whether the article really is what it is
| labelled as, we tell them the truth.”
We admire this wisdom on the part
of MR. BINGLEY. Truth being, like
t diamonds, very precious, should not be

part of a thrifty tradesman only to tell
the truth when his customers ask for it.
It would be unseemly in him to press

And therefore the iniquitous rogue-
the open day-light thief, to the value of

trial—and the wise, judicious tradesman
is bound over to prosecute. Wretched

ST. STEPHEN'S SCHOOL, WESTMINSTER.
R. PEEL,
HEAD MASTER or THE ABOVE school,
Begs leave to remind his young friends that the establishment will re-
open on the twenty-second of January, when he hopes to find them all
in their places, and ready to pursue their ordinary tasks. He has several
good lessons in preparation, particularly for the agricultural class, who,
it is hoped, will profit by what he is desirous of teaching them. While
he is anxious to encourage good boys with suitable rewards, it must be
remembered that he has several rods in pickle, which he shall freely use,
if he finds any necessity for doing so. He is determined to preserve the
strictest discipline, and to put down anything like insubordination wher-
ever it may show itself.
R. PEEL has determined on putting down everything in the shape of
sliding, which he will not allow to exist on any scale whatever.
Complaints having been made of the greediness of a small portion of
the pupils, by whom the rest are deprived of what is fairly due to them,
food to all. Those who show any opposition to his plan will be compelled
to learn an extra lesson.
The boys in the upper form are particularly desired to take warning by
the disobedience of MastER STANLEY, who has lost his place, which has
been taken by another and better behaved boy, Master W. Glapstons.
R. PEEL hopes that there will be no quarrelling between the different
classes, as too frequently happens in St. Stephen's School, for want of
discipline.
“PEPPER, AND THAT sort of THING."
We read in the papers, that, at the time the Duke of Nonpolk made
his dreadful lapsus about the curry, the Duke of Richmond said his
feeling was such, that “he wished the earth would open and hide him.”
The Duke of Richmond has not been altogether disappointed; for in
consequence of his ducal displays at several Protection Meetings, the
press has since opened upon him, and given him the hiding he so
particularly wanted.

In answer to a country correspondent, we beg leave to state that the
R. PEEL has made arrangements for giving an unrestricted supply of

THE MILITIA MOVEMENT.
/- ^2. E regret to say that already
-- \ º wº by anticipation the pros-
- * - " ---- pect of the drawing for the
--- Militia is throwing a dark
and lowering shade over the
domestic hearth of many a
family. The gallant fellow
of Brook Green, who has al-
ready voluntarily undergone
the exertions of a review,
and the horrors of a bivouac,
has been accustoming him-
self to a laceration of his
5 feelings by rehearsing a par-
ting from the wife of his bo-
soul. “
This affecting incident has
been carefully got up, with
- all the accessories of arms
and accoutrements, together
with the heart-rending ap-
pendage of the Soldier's Tear,
--- which the Brook Green Mi-
litia Man contrives, with true military punctuality, to cause to be starting
in his eye, just as he himself is ready for starting. In the words of the
poet—or nearly so,
Upon the road he turned
To take a last fond look
Of the Wille of Hammersmith and Green
That bears the name of Brook.
He said some parting words
We do not want to hear,
And the Soldier, having blown his nose,
Did wipe away a tear.
D -
It would be violating the sanctity of domestic sorrow were we to carry
this affecting picture further. For our own parts, we deeply and sensibly
appreciate the patriotic feeling that has inspired the one Militia Man with
| this precocious ardour for serving his country. It has been beautifully said
that one volunteer is worth a whole company of pressed men, and the
hero of Hammersmith must be a regiment in himself, if we estimate his
value by his eagerness to defend his native land, or rather his native
Green, from foreign invasion.
The calling out of the Militia will involve a considerable stoppage to
commerce and the polite arts; for the linendraper's “young man” may
be suddenly called from the counter to the field, and be compelled to lay
down the yard measure for the musket.
It would not be a bad plan to have the regulation muskets a yard long,
for the use of the Militia, so that they might be taking their military
measures and their civil measures at the same time. We can conceive
the dilemma in which the perruquier will sometimes be placed when duty
calls him to drill, and business requires him to dress the hair of a cus-
tomer.

“MR. Punch,
“I observe in a late Number a letter from those two very
rococo persons, Railway Panic and Potato Panic, complaining of me, as
having (to use a vulgar expression) put their respectable noses completely
out of joint. Now, Mr. Punch, it is I who have just grounds for com-

the customary vehicles, your two correspondents (once, I will allow, con-
siderable persons) figure in every third line, while I am entirely excluded

It is proposed to raise a corps of female militia. . Mrs. Harris has,
most nobly, volunteered to take the command. We admire the pluck of
the old lady, and can tell her that she has a most formidable weapon in
her own paper; for we are sure that the stoutest heart must quake
before it. We have known many courageous spirits who were proof
against fire, fatigue, short commons, ridicule, and the whole series of
military hardships; but we never knew the man yet who could stand the
Standard. Mrs. Harris has only to unfurl it, and we will serve in the
militia ourselves, if everybody does not instantly take to flight.

We have frequently been entertained by the feats of Indian Rubber
Brothers, Mackintosh Youths, Egyptian Untrustables, and other pheno-
mena of human pliability and strength; but we have lately been asto-
nished by the extraordinary performances of a political trio, whose
exploits have been the admiration of all, who have, witnessed them.
The three phenomena to whom we have alluded, are all distinguished in
different styles of excellence. Cobden, familiarly known as the Anti-
Corn-Law Hencules, is remarkable for activity and strength; while
Russell, the City Tumbler, is peculiar for his activity in leaping up, as
well as his remarkable rapidity in coming down again.
Perhaps, however, the greatest prodigy of all, is Peel, the Tamworth
Turnabout, or great Conservative Incredible, who has earned a reputation
for the velocity of his movements, as well as for a certain knack of keeping
his balance while supported entirely by the strength of Russºul, and
Cobden. The tact with which the Tamworth Turnabout can shift his
position from side to side, in order to sustain his equilibrium, has won
the admiration of every one who has witnessed it. Our artist has repre-
sented him in his favourite attitude, with his head one way and his hands
another; giving his countenance to one side, and yet very cleverly appear-
ing to lean to the opposite direction.
-l
We have no doubt that the performances at St. Stephen's, during the
ensuing session, will be enlivened by feats of agility and strength, on the
part of the three great Political Acrobats.
“AGRICULTURAL PROTECTION.”
To young ladies, half-pay officers, clerks in the Treasury, tide-waiters,
sinecurists, and footmen, who cannot help sometimes reading the papers,
and listening to political conversation, the phrase “ icultural º:
tection” cannot be unfamiliar. It may, however, be doubted whether
these classes know, precisely, what “Agricultural Protection” means.
On this point Loap ALFoºd has done something towards astonishing, if
not enlightening, the description of minds above adverted to. “Agri
cultural Protection,” as defined by his Lordship in a speech at a meeting
of the Bedfordshire Agricultural Society, held at the Swan Inn,
Bedford, is-
“Such a protection as would prevent the poorlands from going out of cultivation; a
diminution of the profits of the farmer, a lessening of the wages of the labourer; and as
to the landlord, he must take care of himself.”
In fact, according to Loan ALFoRn, Agricultural Protection consists in
the landlord's taking care of himself. The diminution of the farmer's
profits, and the lessening of the labourer's wages, would follow as a matter
of course. To judge from the present rate of labourers' wages, landlords
in general have taken very good care of themselves. Agriculture has
been protected, on Lord ALFoap's principle, with a vengeance 1-
It is wonderful how Loºp ALFoRD could have made such a speech" as
that from which we have quoted an extract. But the marvel is not in-
explicable. Perhaps his Lordship had dined. Certainly Lond ALFord's
definition of “Agricultural Protection ".is a very true one.

MRS. BIB’S BABY.
CHAPTER I.
Hush : “SARAH, what can this blessed
baby want 1 Can't you remember 1
It must be roast pig.” Thus spoke
Mas. DAFFY, mother of young MRs.
B1.B ; and by consequence, grand-
mother of the month-old baby lying
on her lap, and as it seemed, conti-
nually tasting its own lips. “My
dear, it must be pig,” again averred
MRs. DAFFY.
“Impossible,” said young Mn.
BIB, confidently, as though he re-
solved some mathematical proposi-
tion. “What can so young a crea-
ture know of the taste of pig f"
It is a great, a proud triumph for
woman, when she can look down
upon the ignorance of the male ani-
mal—loftily down, as from a garret-
window. Thus, MR. BiB no sooner
spoke, than MRs. DAFFY enjoyed
such conquest suddenly. How very
small in grandmother's wise eyes
was MR. BIB He had sunk to the
dimensions and intelligence of a
mere domestic piece of furniture;
a chattel—a three-legged stool. He
had forfeited his divine diploma as
a rational creature, and stood at his
own hearthstone—in the presence
of the wife of his bosom and the
child of his loins—a nincompoop—a nobody.
Now, be it remembered, Ma. and MRs. Bin were both young—
some people declared, foolishly young. It is true, they had crowned
themselves with the glory of a parent ; but then, what could they
know of children? Everybody asked it. And so, what a treasure
at their fire-side was Mas. DAFFY | We have watered our ink
from the well of Truth; and therefore must certify that in the
common, prose events of prose life, Mas. DAFFY was in no way a
very remarkable person. She ruled DAFFY, rated her servants, and
#. her own domestic wisdom, as exercised in her various
ctions of wife and housewife in no manner to distinguish her
from a million of her sisterhood. But in the matter of babies, she
was an extraordinary woman I Let a baby be born to any of her
friends, and how MRs. DAFFY would rise with the occasion . With
what dignity—the natural result of conscious power l—would she
quietly swim into their houses, and elect herself—a sort of chancellor
in petticoats—the guardian of infants. She at once combined in her
own majestic maternity the person of father and mother, of grand-
fathers and grandmothers, of uncles and aunts of the newly-born.
The baby was her baby; her privilege; her property. Its mere
mother was just tolerated—and that only when very meek indeed—
whilst the father was just a sort of person allowed the run of the
house, Mas. DAFFY adopted the child—made it her own from the
moment of its birth—and only now and then, from an unbounded
generosity of temper, permitted father and mother to assume any
interest in their own flesh. Her look and manner, when nursing
baby, seemed continually to say—“I am myself solely responsible
for this transaction; and, save when I choose to condescend, admit
of no interlopers. Father and mother, and all sorts of relations,
know your places.”
And it must be confessed that, to a great extent, MRs. DAFFY
had earned a right to this supremacy; for her passion was babies—
and like green peas, the younger they were, the better she loved
them. In her own words, “the sweeter they were to her.” This
moral epicureanism—this love of human novelty—this craving for
the last new baby, as for the last new bonnet, was not to be dis-
guised by MRs. DAFFY. No : it was plain that as baby's clothes
were shortened, Mas. DAFFY's interest in the thing diminished;
and when it once run alone, it almost seemed to her that the creature
had achieved a fair start in the world, and had therefore released her
sympathies, that they might engage themselves to the next new
comer. And it must be owned, she never permitted them to be long
out of employment.
It is known that some people have a strange, a fearful relish for
death-beds: that they will run—aye, much faster than the present
serious generation to a bran-new play—to see their brethren lay
down their parts of life. It is possible that such sight-seers seek
the show—a show wherein they must some day be the hero—to
learn decency, or dignity for themselves, at their final leave-taking.
Now, the more cheerful, hopeful taste of Mas. DAFFY, made her
seek precisely the opposite scene. She delighted to contemplate the
renewal of the world. To her ears the first cry of a baby was the
music of hope; a sound as of psaltery and timbrel,-though we do
not insist that she very clearly comprehended what such instruments
were—breathing the triumph of life, and the rejoicing of man's
spirit: a sound, speaking of the activities of the world—of mortal
striving, and mortal conquest. Something of this kind—though we
own we have put the thoughts into holiday clothes—always, at such
seasons, stirred in the brain of Mas. DAFFY. Hence, when sum-
moned from her home—and how blithely, with what a radiant look
she would take leave of Darry —for her delicious mission—to wel-
come another small citizen to the world, to hear him wailingly take
up his freedom of the universe—MRs. DAFFY was always beautifully
impressed with the solemnity of her task. QUEEN SHEBA, setting
forth to meet KING Solomon, must have felt something of the dig-
nity of purpose that always possessed Mas. DAFFY when summoned
to meet the unknown, mysterious little one, that might turn out a
KING Solomon, or might be—for the dynasty will never be extinct
—a KING Noople ! And then, how all matters—even the most
trifling—appertaining to the expected stranger, became heightened
and beautified in the eyes of Mrs. DAFFY 1 No astronomer with
greater rapture could decipher the immortal meaning of the sky—
writ eternally as it is in starry thoughts—no scholar, dipt in the
depths of Egyptian lore, could with keener pleasure pluck out the
subtle soul from the husk of hieroglyphs—than would Mas. DAFFY,
for the hundredth time, gaze upon the pin-cushion whereon were writ
the time-old syllables of love and hope—“Welcome, little strangerſ"
It was this devotion to babies that made MRs. DAFFY consider
them as sent from heaven to man's fireside, as man's best reward.
“You’re a good man,”—she has been known, in rare moments of
enthusiasm, to declare to the patronised father, “You’re a good
man, and quite deserve the babe you have.” As if a babe were a
sort of medal bestowed by fate upon a man, for early hours and
good conduct.
With these self-imposed duties, so rigidly carried out, it was
natural—it was very proper—that Mas. DAFFY should have her
moments of pride. And then her indulgence of the feeling was of a
touching sort, expressed too, at times, with a truly feminine con-
tempt for logic. We give a case.
A young clergyman—one of Mas. Daffy's babies—preached his
maiden sermon in MRs. DAFFY's parish pulpit, and received from
the congregation rounds and rounds of mute applause.
“He’s a sweet preacher 1" cried one gentleman. “So impres-
sive 1° cried another. “So very orthodox 1" said a third. Where-
upon MRs. DAFFY, with a sweet smile, clinched—for there are most
clinching smiles—such flattering opinions. For, drawing herself up,
she said, “He is orthodox. I put on his first things.”
To go back, however, to the beginning. Baby still smacks its lips:
“Sarah, my dear.”—says Mas. DAFFY, -“what can this blessed
infant want?”
But this question we must endeavour to answer in another chapter.

“‘I had all along hoped that you

* THE ONLY AUTHENT1c Account.
“The neighbourhood of Berkeley Square, and the whole fashionable
world, has been thrown into a state of the most painful excitement by an
event which has just placed a noble family in great perplexity and
affliction.
“It has long been known among the select nobility and gentry that a
marriage was on the tapis between the only daughter of a Noble Earl, and
a Gentleman whose rapid fortunes in the railway world have been the
theme of general remark. “Yesterday's paper, it was supposed, in all
human probability would have contained an account of the marriage of
JAMES DE LA PL–CHR, Esq. and the LADY ANGELINA , daughter of the
Right Honorable the EARL of B–RE—cREs. The preparations for this
| ceremony were complete: we had the pleasure of inspecting the rich
trousseau (prepared by Miss Twiddleh, of Pall Mall); the magnificent
jewels from the establishment of MESSRs. StoRR AND MoRTIMER: the
elegant marriage cake, which, already cut up and portioned, is, alas !
not destined to be eaten by the friends of MR. De LA PL - che : the
superb carriages, and magnificent liveries, which had been provided in a
style of the most lavish yet tasteful sumptuosity. The Right Reverend
the Lord Bishop of Bullocksmithy had arrived in town to celebrate the
nuptials, and is staying at Mrvant's. What must have been the feelings
of that venerable prelate, what those of the agonised and noble parents
of the LADY ANGELINA-when it was discovered, on the day previous to
the wedding, that her Ladyship had fled the paternal mansion To the
venerable Bishop the news of his noble niece's departure might have been
fatal : we have it from the waiters of MIVART's that his Lordship was about
to indulge in the refreshment of turtle soup when the news was brought to
him ; immediate apoplexy was apprehended; but MR. MACANN, the ele-
brated Surgeon, of Westminster, was luckily passing through Bond Street
at the time, and being promptly called in, bled pnd relieved the exem-
plary patient. His Lordship will return to the Palace, Bullocksmithy,
to-morrow.
“The frantic agonies of the Right Honorable the EARL of BAREAcres
can be imagined by every paternal heart. Far be it from us to disturb
—impossible is it for us to describe their noble sorrow. Our reporters
have made inquiries every ten minutes at the Earl's mansion in Hill
Street, regarding the health of the Noble Peer and his incomparable
Countess. They have been received with a rudeness which we deplore but
would have relinquished pretensions.
pardon.—One was threatened with a cane ; another, in the pursuit of his
official inquiries, was saluted with a pail of water; a third gentleman was
menaced in a pugilistic manner by his Lordship's porter: but being of
the Irish nation, a man of spirit and sinew, and Master of Arts of
Trinity College, Dublin, the gentleman of our establishment confronted
the menial, and having severely beaten him, retired to a neighbouring
hotel much frequented by the domestics of the surrounding nobility, and
there obtained what we believe to be THE MOST AccuRATE PARTICULARs of
this extraordinary occurrence.
“GEORGE FREDERIck JENNINGs, third footman in the establishment of
LoRD BAREaCREs, stated to our employé as follºws:—LADY ANGELINA
has been promised to MR. DE LA Pluche for near six weeks. She never
could abide that gentleman. He was the laughter of all the servants'
hall. Previous to his elevation he had himself been engaged in a domes-
tic capacity. At that period he had offered marriage to Many Ann Hog-
GINs, who was living in the quality of ladies' maid in the family where MR
De La P. was employed. Miss Hoggins became subsequently ladies' maid
to LADY ANGELINA-the elopement was arranged between those two.—It
was Miss Hoggins who delivered the note which informed the bereaved
MR. Plush of his loss.
“SAMUEL BUTTons, page to the Right Honorable the EARL or
BAREAcaEs, was ordered on Friday forenoon at eleven-o'clock to fetch a
cabriolet from the stand in Davies Street. He selected the cab, No.
19,796, driven by Gronge GREGony MacARTY, a one-eyed man from
Clonakilty, in the neighbourhood of Cork, Ireland (of whom more anon),
and waited, according to his instructions, at the corner of Berkeley Square
with the vehicle. His young lady, accompanied by her maid Miss MARY
ANNE Hoggins, carrying a band-box, presently arrived, and entered the
cab with the box: what were the contents of that box we have never
been able to ascertain. On asking her ladyship whether he should
order the cab to drive in any particular direction, he was told to drive
to MADAME CRINoLINE's, the eminent milliner, in Cavendish Square. On
requesting to know whether he should accompany her ladyship, BUTTONs
was peremptorily ordered by Miss Hoggins to go about his business.
“Having now his clue, our reporter instantly went in search of cab
19,796, or rather of the driver of that vehicle, who was discovered with
no small difficulty at his residence, Whetstone Park, Lincoln's Inn Fields,
where he lives with his family of nine children. Having received two
sovereigns, instead doubtless of two shillings (his regular fare, by the way,
would have been only one and eightpence), MacARTY had not gone out
with the cab for the two last days, passing them in a state of almost
ceaseless intoxication. His replies were very incoherent in answer to the
queries of our reporter; and, had not that gentleman been himself a com-
patriot, it is probable he would have refused altogether to satisfy the
curiosity of the public.
“At MADAME CRINoLINE's, Miss Hoggins quitted the carriage, and a
gentleman entered it. MACARTY describes him as a very clever gentleman
(meaning tall) with black moustaches, Oxford-grey trowsers, and black
hat and a pea-coat. He drove the couple to the Euston Square Station,
and there left them. How he employed his time subsequently we have
stated.
“At the Euston Square Station, the gentleman of our establishment
learned from FREDER1c CoRDuRoy, a porter there, that a gentleman
answering the above description had taken places to Derby. We have
despatched a confidential gentleman thither, by a special train, and shall
give his report in a second edition.

“* Whistlebinkie, N.B. Monday, midnight.
“I arrived at this romantic little villa about two hours after the newly-
married couple, whose progress I have had the honour to trace, reached
Whistlebinkie. They have taken up their residence at the Cairngorm
Arms—mine are at the other hostelry, the Clachan of Whistlebinkie.
“On driving up to the Cairngorm Arms, 1 found a gentleman of mili-
tary appearance standing at the door, and occupied seemingly in smoking
a cigar. It was very dark as I descended from my carriage, and the
gentleman in question exclaimed, ‘Is it you, South Down, my boy 1 You
have come too late: unless you are come to have some supper;' or words
to that effect. Hexplained that I was not the Lord Viscount Southdown,
and politely apprised Captain SilverTop (for I justly emcluded the indi.
vidual beforeme could be no other) of his mistake.
“‘Who the dence (the Captain used a stronger term) are you, then l'
“Are you Baags & Tarawell, my uncle's attor-
neys? If you are, you have came too late for the fair.”
“I briefly explaimed that I was not Baggs & Taemwell, but that my
name was J–Ns, and that I was a gentleman connected with the
Establishment of the Morning Tatler newspaper.
“And what has brought you here, Ms. MoRNING TATLER ‘’asked my
interlocutor, rather roughly. My answer was frank,-that the disappear-
ance of a noble lady from the house of her friends had caused the
greatest excitement in the metropolis, and that my employers were
anxious to give the public every particular regarding an event so singular.
“And do you mean to say, sir, that you have dogged me all the
from London, and that my family affairs are to be published for the
readers of the Morning Tatler newspaper? The Morning Tatler be
(the Captain here gave utterance to an oath which I shall not repeat)
and you too, sir; you impudent meddling scoundrel.'
**Scoundrel, sir!” said I. ‘Yes,’ replied the irate gentleman, seizing
me rudely by the collar—and he would have choked me, but that my
blue satin stock and false collar gave way, and were left in the hands of
this gentleman. “Help, landlord 1' I loudly exclaimed, adding, I believe,
‘murder,’ and other exclamations of alarm. In vain I appealed to the
crowd, which by this time was pretty considerable; they and the unfeeling
post-boys only burst into laughter, and called out, ‘Give it him, Captain.”
A struggle ensued, in which, I have no doubt, I should have had the
better, but that the Captain, joining suddenly in the general and indecent
hilarity, which was doubled when I fell down, stopped, and said, “Well,
JIMs, I won't fight on my marriage-day. Go into the tap, JIMs, and order
a glass of brandy-and-water at my expense—and mind I don't see your
face to-morrow morning, or I'll make it more ugly than it is.”
“With these gross expressions and a cheer from the crowd, MR.
SILVERTop entered the inn. I need not say that I did not partake of his
hospitality, and that personally I despise his insults. Imake them known
that they may call down the indignation of the body of which I am a
member, and throw myself on the sympathy of the public, as a gentleman
shamefully assaulted and insulted in the discharge of a public duty.”
OUR INDIAN MAIL.
THE excessive richness of the intelligence that comes home twice
a month by the Indian Mail, has caused us to consider whether it may
not be worth our while to start an express of our own, for the purpose of
getting early notice of the fun that is passing at the Punjaub.
We find, by the accounts in the Times, that some friends of our own,
called “Punches,” have been falling out with the RANEE, and that SIRDAR
TEJ SINGh, together with RAJAH LALL, have been trying to pacify them.
The PUNCHEs seem to have carried their point, whatever it was ; and
indeed, if they were genuine Punches, they would be certain to succeed in
anything they attempted. It appears that they assembled at the Huzoree-
bagh, the sign of some public-house, we presume, and found four or
five hundred rupees' worth of goorroo ka kurra purshad, prepared for
them. This goorrooka, &c. &c. is, we are told, a kind of sweetmeat, so that
it appears the RANEE hoped to stop the mouths of the PUNCHEs with
lollipops. We don't believe it is very likely that the plan would prove suc-
cessful. If they are kindred spirits, the “kind of sweetmeat” will have no
more effect upon them than a feast of hard-bake, or an entertainment of
Albert-rock, would have upon us if we were pursuing any great object.

WE recommend an addition to the “Dissolving Views” exhibited at
the Polytechnic. Could not the managers of that institution contrive to
include among their tableaux a view of the existing Corn Laws ,

ULYSSES, BUCKINGHAM, AND PUNCH.
"Avôpa uot ºvere, ugºra, troAºrporov.
“Dean Punch,--I observe that MR, Buckingham has brought out a new
edition of his matchless Pamphlet, in which he draws “a parallel between
the Thersites of Hoxtºn and the Punch of Fleet Street.’ I, Mr. Punch,
should have remained an obscure admirer of yours, (and more especially
of MR. Buckingham's), knowing nothing of the original merits of the
quarrel, and taking no partin it, had not certain dishonest imputations,
lately cast by one of the parties, placed him, as it seems to me, somewhat
beyond the forbearance of honest men. Having premised thus much, I
wish just to remark, that it is strange that, when engaged in the study
of his ‘crib' to Hoxtºn, hunting for parallels, MR. Buckingham should
have overlooked that most obvious one which exists between the roadwºrris
ošvage's, (“many-dodged Ulysses,') and another rather well-known
relater of travellers' stories of the present day. For, just let us see what
Ulysses accomplished: we shall find,-
“1. Sea-sand cultivated.
2. The Lotus Eaters, Phoenicians and Silly Islanders, discovered.
3. (See Tennyson) America discovered.
4. The raising of the winds (the whole being placed in a bag)
accomplished. +
5. Rhesus done.
6. Ajax done.
7. Polypheytus done.

11. The underland journey to Hades accomplished.
12. The drawing a bow so long that none could draw it after him,
accomplished. And
13. (By means of a remarkable dodge suggested to Trndanus)
The Trojan War accomplished.
I have only to add, that by the last-mentioned accomplishment Ulysses
became the Author and Founder (and, for many years, in reality, Perma-
nent Director,) of much Greek and Foreign Destitution.

PRESENTS FOR THE PRINCE.
THE Chairman of “The East Berks Royal Agricultural Landlords and
Labourers' Encouragement Society,” has pronounced His Royal High-
Ness PRINCE ALBERT “in every essential an English farmer.” That the
Prince may in every particular, as well as every essential, be an English
farmer, he should dress the character. At the last Cattle-show a sum of
twenty guineas was awarded to him for a prize ox; and the above-named
Society gave him 31, for the production of the best Swedish turnips.
A more appropriate present for a Prince than a sum of money, would
be a suit of clothes—of the right agricultural cut. For the next prize
ox that he produces let His Royal Highness receive a smock frock,
embroidered, to render the gift more gracious. For his next monster
turnip a stout pair of corduroys may be awarded. When next he exhi-
bits a fat sheep, or an improved hog, let him be presented with a service-
able pair of ankle-jacks, which will the better enable the farmers of Eng-
land to tread in his Royal footsteps.
To crown all, His Royal Highness inclusive, we would suggest a neat
pastoral straw hat, with a blue or red ribbon round it; unless, indeed,
giving PRINCE ALBERT a hat is not something like sending coals to New-
castle.

A New School for the Blind is to be opened in Dover Place,New Kent

not if age will constitute an exclusion from the benefits of this Institu-

mended for the Dukes of Norfolk and Richmond, and not a few other
great landowners, who are sadly afflicted with blindness, and who, every-
body will admit, ought as soon as possible to go to school again.

AMongst the names of the new Ministry we do not see the name of

PUNCH2S MINISTERIAL EXPLANATIONS.
UNch believes it is not generally known, that
during the Ministerial Crisis, when the
Ministry was neither one thing nor
the other—that is to say, neither Lord
John Russel L or Sin R. PEEL–
that he was applied to with a view to
his undertaking the formation of a
Cabinet. He had advanced consider-
ably in the important task; he had
advertised in the Times for a young
man with his evenings disengaged,
to keep a set of books, whom he had
agreed with as Chancellor of the Ex-
chequer; he had engaged a First Lord
of the Admiralty, worth half-a-dozen
LoRD ELLENBoroughs, from the
Margate Steam Packet Company's
boats; and indeed he was going on as
swimmingly as possible in the getting
together of a good efficient hard-work-
ing Ministry. He is certain that his
selection of men for the important
task of governing the country would
have been approved by the nation at
large. He had chosen them as the
hackney-coachman did his horses—
not so much for their appearance as
for their intrinsic value.
Punch pledges himself that if his
Ministers had been “rum uns to look
at,” they would have been at all events
“good uns to go,” which is the most
important quality in a set of Cabinet
Ministers. It is all very well to talk
of Lord This, and Sir Robert That,
but we should be glad to know what
a Member of the aristocracy can
possibly know about mere matters of
business. What city house would ask
MR. Goulburn to come and super-
intend its cash department, in preference to a clever clerk who had
been all his life accustomed to accounts on the fine old basis of
WALKER's Arithmetic 1 Our object would have been to have
procured the greatest possible amount of official ability at the lowest
possible price; and it was our intention, if we had been honoured
with the Sovereign's confidence, to have put all the seats in the
Cabinet up to Dutch auction, like so many easy chairs; and we would
have knocked them down, one after the other, to the lowest bidder.
It is true that Lord John Russel L has partly adopted this principle,
by increasing his offers when he finds a difficulty in getting his
price; and he acted the part of a Cheap Jack, when he said,
“Well, if there are no bidders for Fixed Duty, I will throw you in
Total Repeal;” and he almost succeeded in getting his price when
he adopted this very politic system.
Though we have the example of others before us, we shall not be
tempted into the ungentlemanly act of giving to the public any of
our own or our rival's letters on the subject of our attempt to form
a Ministry. We may go so far as to state a few of the stipulations
to which we respectfully required HER MAJESTY to accede, as the
condition of our entering the service of the Sovereign.
First and foremost. The Total, Immediate, and Unconditional
Abolition of the Albert Hat, which we humbly insisted was a delu-
sion and a snare, for it did not embody the principle of protection to
the wearer's head, while from its cumbersome nature, it acted as a
fearful restriction upon his industry.
2nd. A large and liberal measure of supply—for the Fountains in
Trafalgar Square.
3rd. The Colonisation of Herne Bay, and the introduction of a
few model lodging-houses as a guide to the natives, with a view to
the introduction of the arts of civilisation into that beautiful, but
neglected, demi-semi-hemisphere.
4th. The Abolition of all Protective Duties, except Polieemen's
duties, which not being always of a protective character, might be
doubled without any serious injury to the state.
5th. The Absolute and Final Settlement of the great Wood Pave-
ment Question, which is continually opening the road to the very
worst evils with which trade and commerce can be afflicted, cutting
off those means of communication which form the best basis of
friendly relations between two separate districts, and paving the
way to obstructions which it is difficult to overcome.
6th. The Unconditional Opening of the Overland Route from the
West End to the City, involving the entire abolition of the City Toll-
taker, and the sale of his stool for the good of the Civic Charities.
Such were a few of the points upon which we based our condi-
tional acceptance of the Seals of Office from HER MAJEsty's
hands. How it was the country did not obtain the benefit of our
services may hereafter be explained. For the present we have said
enough on this interesting topic.
º, THE NIEW FIRST, LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY.
N |
#The fine old vessel the Admiralty has been consi to the direction
of Lord ELLENBoRough, who has no other qualification for the task than
a dreadnought wrapper. We can only wish the gallant craft a safe pas-
sage under the command of such an inexperienced officer. If a storm
should blow across the Atlantic Ocean, the good ship might be in some
temporary jeopardy from the ignorance of the man at the helm ; but we
have no fear of the ultimate result, nor do we feel any great alarm at the
prospect of a collision with the craft under the command of the French
skipper Joinville.
By the way, we have read in the papers accounts of the extensive
naval preparations that are being made by LoRD ELLENBohough, and we
are enabled to add to the reports by stating, on undeniable autho-
rity, (namely, our own,) that his Lordship has given an order to Mn-
Holman, the coach-maker of Long Acre, for the immediate construction
of 500 captain's gigs, for the use of the British Navy.
Melancholy Bereavement.
It is with no small degree of pleasure that we announce the death of
Mrs. Roberts, aged 10 vols. Her last moments had been anything but
happy. She died in extreme poverty, on the 1st of January, in the
New Monthly Magazine. She was, however, most affectionately
attended to the last by MRs. TRoLLoPE. One or two old readers survive
her loss.
THE BEST AND CHEAPEST DEPOT.
PERsons in want of militia substitutes are advised to apply at the
British and Foreign Destitute. A good, stout, respectable one, can be
had for 5l., and the person thanked. A varied muster always on the
premises. Ring the third bell from the bottom, on the left side, and
inquire for the person who drills them, MR. S. Buckingham.

BURDENS ON BARRISTERS.
WE have been favoured, by a correspondent who has just been called to
the Bar, with a copy of the bill which he had to pay on that very interesting
occasion. The extreme value of our space will not enable us to print it
at length, which we regret, for the curious manner in which it runs up a
quantity of nominal items to 911. 16s. 3d., is really deserving of attentive
study. Those philosophers who have idly said, that “Nothing can come
to nothing,” would do well to watch the ingenious process by which
nothing, so far from coming to nothing, is cleverly made to come to
ninety-one pounds sixteen shillings and threepence.
The first item is small but comprehensive. It includes a great deal,
but amounts to a very moderate figure. It comprises Pensions, Master,
Officers, and Butlers, all for the small charge of nine shillings and nine-
pence, reminding us of those economical contrivances which combine
for a shilling a pair of scissors, two knives, a tobacco-stopper, a pair of
tweezers, a thing to pick stones out of horses' hoofs, a corkscrew, a
gimlet, and a button-hook, not one of which, by the bye, you can ever use
without breaking two or three of the others.
We come next to a charge of four pounds, for “two New Inn exercises,
not performed.” If this is the price of a negative, or “to put the syllo-
gism thus,” as Bulweh says, “if nothing costs four pounds, what will
something come to ?” The Benchers, who are, no doubt, funny
fellows, may probably throw the celebrated sack of coals and red her-
ring in our face, by way of a reply to this query. The charges are,
however, for things that have not been had, as much as for things that
have been had, the former perhaps having rather the preponderance.
Thus, the very next item is, “In lieu of candlelight, 31.” This is a capi-
tal joke 1 Three peunds in lieu of candlelight,-that is to say, for
keeping one in the dark,+is really exquisite. There are several items in
lieu of various matters, amounting to upwards of three-and-twenty pounds,
from which it would seem that it is customary to charge in an inverse
ratio to what is given for the money.
One of the funniest items in the bill is one of 21. for “Organ and
Lucidaries.” A lucidary is something, we presume, which gives light,
and is necessary, no doubt, in consequence of the absence of candles.
What is the meaning of “Organ” we find it difficult to say. Perhaps
the candidate for the bar is favoured with a voluntary on that noble
instrument, but he surely might have been left to pay for it in the shape
of a voluntary contribution. On the whole, we think the bill would be
more applicable to an attorney on his being admitted, than to a barrister
on his being called. The former might use it as a precedent. It
might teach the young legal idea how to shoot, with a tolerably long bow,
when aiming at the pockets of his future clients.

PUNCH's PoliticAL DICTIONARY.
ARL. This very old title has
given rise to the very old joke
that it is called Earl from
being the earliest of all dig-
nities. WILLIAM THE Con-
quERoR, when he sacked the
country, bagged the whole of
the land, which he distributed
among his followers, and it
title of Earl came out of the
early burly that prevailed dur-
ing that tempestuous period.
The coronet of an English
Earl is surmounted with pearls,
and some antiquarians have
attempted to show some con-
nection between the Earls’
Pearls and Early Purl ; but we
do not think they have suc-
ceeded in establishing their
ingenious theory.
EARL MARshAL or ENG-
- LAND. The getter up of all
state processions, who has the grouping of all the state supernume-
raries, and is, in fact, a sort of stage manager to the Royal House-
hold. The Earl Marshal is the head of the Herald's Office; but as
very little head is used in that office, the situation is a sinecure. The
post is hereditary in the family of the Duke of Norfolk, whose illus-
trious name will live as long as peppers, and that sort of thing, have
the power of preserving it.
EastER OFFERING. A sum of money which no one thinks of
offering until he is dunned for it. It is a voluntary contribution,
given very often by people who would much rather keep the money
in their pockets.
EAsT INDIA ComPANY. This powerful Association originated in
1599 in a Prospectus, and an announcement that applications for
shares would be received, just like any of those Railway affairs of
the present day, with which all of us are so familiar. The capital
was only 30,000l., which was subsequently augmented several times,
and Charters were granted ; but in 1636 an opposition was started,
in which the King, who had consented to become a Stag, was a
shareholder. The new concern afterwards amalgamated with the
old ; but in 1655 there was another rival project started, with a
provisional committee of “Merchant Adventurers,” patronised by
CRomwell, who, no doubt, like all professed protectors, protected
himself by securing a good slice of the profits. This company also
amalgamated with the other two, and became one concern in 1661,
when a new Charter was granted. Subsequently there was another
opposition; but in 1702 an Act was passed uniting them all, and we
are only surprised that during the recent bubble mania no new com-
peting Company has been advertised. A new East India and General
Annihilation of Wested Interests’ Association, with shilling deposits,
and an F.R.S. or two among the Provisional Committee, would have
been sure of a favourable reception in the city a few months ago.
It is not necessary to tantalise such of our readers as have no share
in the East India Company, by telling them what are the profits and
privileges of a concern with which they have nothing to do. We
shall also refrain from giving any particulars of those furious
skrimages between Budnee Bagazore, Ramshackle Bang Galore,
and other individuals, whose exploits are every month recorded in
the Indian Mail. We leave these interesting matters to those en-
terprising individuals who spend five thousand pounds a year in
*uly breakneck expresses between the Punjaub and Cheap-
810ie.

THE SIN OF SEEDINESS.
At the Clerkenwell Police Office, one day last week, one MARY LAMB,
a distressed-looking Irishwoman, was placed at the bar with her two chil-
dren, charged with begging. If every Irish mendicant were taken up,
what a fine thing it would be l—would it not, MR. O'Connell ?
Police-constable, 136 E, deposed, that on the previous evening, between
four and five o'clock, he was on duty in Russell Square, when he saw the
poor woman sitting on the step of a door, with her two children. The
wolf seized upon the lamb He took her into custody. “For what?”
inquired MR. CoMBE, the magistrate. Quoth the constable, “For exciting
charity.” He admitted that the prisoner had asked for nothing of the

On reading the above in the Chronicle police report, we were almost
tempted to forget our sex, and to exclaim, “Well, we never !” So one
is liable to be taken up for exciting charity We seriously advise our
readers to mind what they are about ; that is to say, how they go about.
A coat out at elbows is an object that excites charity. Mind that, ye poor
artists and authors. Look to your cracked Wellingtons; the horrid burst
appeals to commiseration,--is calculated to excite charity. Have the
fear of the station-house before your eyes, all ye pallid teetotalers; charity
may be excited by your lean and hungry looks. Labourers at seven
shillings a-week, take care; your condition excites charity; you are in
contradictions, your absurdities, without doubt excite charity.

away their thousands of pounds, their globes, and their numerous other
magnificent presents, we have it in contemplation to endeavour to keep
pace with the generosity we see around us, by offering some gift to the
almost countless subscribers to our work. Being desirous of acting with
a liberality worthy of our name, we have determined on making the pre-
sent as handsome as possible; but we find a difficulty in hitting upon
something new. Giving money is an old and somewhat vulgar idea, for
we would rather not insult our friends by the offer of pecuniary assist-
ance. At one time we thought of making a lottery of it, and giving our
acceptance to any one who happened to draw a bill; but, on reflection,
we did not consider this a prudent or respectable course.
We next had it in contemplation to give a sirloin of beef to every sub-
scriber for a year, a leg of pork to those who paid for six months in
advance, and a mutton chop for a quarterly subscription; but on consi-
deration we found there was no novelty in the scheme, for a somewhat
similar experiment had been tried several years ago at the Lyceum, when
ices were offered as an attraction; but the coolness of the public towards
the theatre was only increased by the plan.
We have at length come to the conclusion that the most handsome
present we can offer our subscribers is a husband or a wife.
our readers as are already married may, if successful, exchange the wife
or husband for a copy of the Caudle Lectures. Our plan of the distri-
bution will be as follows:—Every male subscriber, on paying for a year
in advance—or two years, if he likes, will deposit his name with the
publisher, stating whether he is married or unmarried. He will receive
a number at the time of paying his subscription, and the same course being
pursued with the female subscribers, those who get the corresponding
numbers will be entitled to the privilege of becoming man and wife.
Previous to the full carrying out of our project, we purpose trying it on
a small scale ; and, in order to meet the circumstances of all classes of
subscribers, we intend to give away three matrimonial prizes, each
belonging to a separate rank in life. The husbands will be on view at our
office the day before the distribution; and, for the convenience of sub-
scribers at a distance, daguerreotype portraits will be supplied.
1st. A magnificent half-pay captain, five feet ten inches high, wears his
own hair, and will be five-and-thirty years of age next March. He has
remote expectations of a contingent remainder of the probable reversion
of a little property in Ireland. - -

at present, and expectations of a rise of ten pounds once in fifteen years,
in the event of the death of any of his superiors. -
This last being considered eligible, chiefly as a nice genteel lot, there will
be two or three prizes of this class, so as to give the opportunity to the
fortunate prize-holders, of changing the baker or the half-pay captain for
one of the gentlemen in the Government offices. i º

- PANYER ALLEY.
"THERE is in the heart of London—that heart which has been in a state
of ossification for the last century at least—a little passage called Panyer
Alley, said to be the highest ground in London. Why it is called Panyer
Alley is not accurately known; but the general impression is, that it took
the name of Panyer, or Panier, from some dreadful old donkey who once
resided there.” ".
*The origin of the old legend, as to its being the highest ground, is wrapt
up in the Macintosh of mystery, or rather in the Dreadnought of doubt,
which it is quite impossible to remove at present. We really know of so
many highest grounds in London, that we know not to which particular
spot we ought to give the preference. Golden Square used to boast of its
altitude, but it has been taken down a peg or two; and we do not now
hear, as we used to hear, of its being the Mount Blanc of the metropolis.
|The long-range of hills from Snow to Holborn form a chain of rugged
Alp-like heights; and perhaps Panyer Alley may be called the highest
ground, because being in the neighbourhood of Paternoster Row, formerly
the abode of the Muses, it may claim a relationship to the Happy-nines.
Bayswater boasts that its kitchen windows are on a level with the chimney-
* of Belgrave Square'; so that Notting Hill is aspecies of Ben Lomond.
f we divide Ben Nevis by two, and multiply by Mount Pleasant, we
shall get at the exact height of the highest ground in London. . .
When we consider the propinquity of Paternoster Row to Panyer Alley;
when we reflect that the latter is in the very neighbourhood of literature;
we are surprised at the assumption that this is the highest ground, for
literature was never able to take very high ground, in the time of Stowe
and the old Chroniclers. Some think that the inscription,
“When you have search'd the City round,
You'll still find this the highest ground,”
is from the pen of SPENSER, but we suspect it is a plagiarism from some
other author; and it is very clear that the writer on the stone—whoever
he may be—has ſchiselled the distich. We have such an admiration for
old London nooks, that we should be glad to pass a summer's day in
Panyer Alley. - -
Those who can read “sermons in stones” may get: a very respectable
homily out of the old tablet that adorns this locality. They may moralise
on the vanity of boasting ambition, and, looking at the dirty neglected
piece of stone, may ask themselves what it has got by declaring itself to
be the highest ground in London Who cares whether it is the highest
ground or the lowest ? and what avails the impudent self-glorification of
the lifeless piece of granite?
EMIGRATION.
It has been seriously proposed that, instead of sending strong working
men out of the country, large premiums be offered for the future to the
Dukes, to induce them to emigrate.

THE PUFF PANTOMIME.
s the pantomimes are now all drawing
to the end of their respective ca-
reers, we take the opportunity of
adding one more to the number,
which we promise shall be the last
for the present season. It must
have been obvious to all who have
witnessed this class of entertain-
ment during the last few years,
that their object has lately been
to puff the goods and establish-
ments of particular tradesmen.
This purpose having been only
partially carried out in the pan-
tomimes of the present year, we
think it desirable to supply the
deficiency by a few scenes calcu-
lated to give a healthy impetus to
those branches of commerce which
have been neglected by the writers
or concocters of the entertain-
ments for the recently concluded
holidays.
The Stage represents an Irish Earl lying prostrate on a bank, in the
enchanted gardens of Surinam, In, the back-ground is a view of
Aldborough Castle.
CHORUs or Good spirits.
Gentle spirits treading lightly,
Guard thee from terrestrial ills:
To thy pillow bringing nightly
Boxes of the welcome pills.
Ah! well-a-day, sing Holloway;
Singhey-dey, merry 1
Well-a-day 1 sing Holloway,
Dingdong, derry :
The spirits disappear, and the Irish Eart rises. He rubs his eyes
and seems refreshed.
THE Earl.
What’s this? Where am I? -What are they about 4.
I dreamt that I was torn by fiends of gout;
And then methought a spirit came to cheer:-
It brought relief. Ha! hat what have we here?
There's an inscription too. What does it say?
“To him who might or would.” That means, I may.”
[He takes the lid ºff.
LSees a bow.
[Reads.
Within the box there’s an inscription too.
“Fear not too many, but avoid too few.
Whoever would be free from earthly ills,
Will take, each night and morn, six of these pills.”
Already it is morning by the sun:
I'll trust the Genius, and I’ll swallow one. IMusic.
Tribes
The Earl takes a pill.
He gradually throws down his crutches.
of fairies advance, who unroll the bandages from his legs, and he
dances the Cellarius, to the following Chorus of Good spirits.
Well-a-day, Holloway —Who would shun,
All through life terrestrial ills,
Must take, at the rising of the sun,
One of the celebrated pills.
Ah! Well-a-day ! Well-a-day !
Holloway-Holloway :
Lara la la la 1
As the Fairies disappear the words “Holloway” and “Well-a-day” are
heard in the distance, and the scene changes.
The preceding scene is chiefly designed for recommending Holloway's
pills, and the happy idea of spiritualising the bolus by fairy agency is
quite sufficient to take off any disagreeable sensation that might becaused
by making medicine so prominent. In the American Romances the
medicine-man is one of the most interesting features of fiction, and there
is no reason why the medicine, as well as the man himself, should not be
brought forward as an agent for dramatic purposes.
The next suggestion for a puff pantomime shall be one relating to
cheap furniture, the commerce in which requires some stimulus; for,
since it has been discovered that the cheap arm-chairs are liable to
dislocation of the elbow, and that tables tumble to pieces without leave,
persons have not been so very anxious to accept the invitations that have
been addressed to them. The following pantomime scene may, however,
be calculated to restore the faith in the “Merry green wood,” which
has rather gone out of repute since its ludicrous fragility has become
notorious.
The scene shows a bower, where a Foung Lady is expecting the arrival
ºf her lover.

Since we’re about to marry.
"We might go on multiplying pantomime scenes ad infinitum on the
subject of the various puffs and quackeries of the day; but we think we
have given sufficient to show the genius by which this style of entertain-
ment is, in the present day, animated. We think, however, that it is
hardly fair to defraud the Stamp Office by large advertisements on the
scenes of a theatre, which are undoubtedly liable to the usual duty. We
recommend the active and efficient clerks in Somerset House to pay
especial attention to these matters for the future. An occasional attend-
ance, half-price, at the theatre would be a pleasant relief to their almost
equally arduous duties in the morning.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MRS. BIB’S BABY.
CHAPTER II.
* “WHAT can this blessed infant want?”—for the third time, and
with increased concern, asked MRs. DAFFY.
As she spoke the door opened, and the elder MRs. BIB—mother of
Baby's father, and therefore Baby's paternal grandmother—entered
the room. There was a frozen smile upon her face that spoke of
injuries endured with the serenity of a martyr. She trod her own
son's carpet with the most cutting assumption of humility—the satire
especially intended for MRs. DAFFY-and begged, in the very
softest tones, to assure the company that she could not stop half a
moment; that she had merely called in as it were—and particularly
hoping it was not a liberty—to inquire about Baby; her son's
Baby.
Whereupon MRs. DAFFY, making suddenly a very small mouth,
answered, “Thank you, ma'am — my daughter's darling boy is
beautiful.”
It was a plain case. The two grandmothers could not agree; and
it was equally plain that they tended and nurtured their mutual
difference as though it was a precious plant—a flower: something to
love and take delight in. They had had the politest quarrel in the
world, when Baby was only half-an-hour old. Grandmother B1 B
had ventured some small suggestion for Baby's good, when Grand-
mother DAFFY thanked her very much indeed—but she knew very
well all about babies, or why—she wished to ask—should she have
had seven Moreover, she should never think of interfering with
Mas. Bin's daughter's child, if, indeed, she should ever have one.
Grandmother BIB was immovably polite. She always smiled.
Look at her face as you would, in any light, it always beamed and
shone—even when, like a richly-cut vinegar cruet, acid dropt from
its brightness. Hence, she was no sooner rebuked than she begged
ten thousand pardons. “Of course, it was only her son's child; the
little creature only belonged to EdwańD : and what right, indeed,
had she to speak She herself had had six children at least; but
of course, MRs. DAffy must know better than she.” Whereupon
MRs. DAFFY, silently, but with a graceful undulation of neck—that
would have honoured any grandmother swan—took the compliment
as her undisputed right. MRs. BIB, however, though for the time
silent, expressed—but still in her smiling way—a very strong after-
opinion. For that very night, upon quitting the house, she gently laid
her hand upon the arm of MARTHA, the maid; and her eyes, despite
of her, beaming, and her face in shining plaits, as though she spoke
of a great coming treat—albeit her heart was cut in twain for the
moment—she said –“My dear BEcky, they'll kill that infant.
Certainly kill it. Good night.”
Possibly, the reader may now imagine the ceremonious feelings
with which the two grandmothers met, at the very moment that
Grandmother DAFFY put the question that heads our chapter.
“We’re thinking,” said BIB, with all the stupidity and hopeless
ignorance of a man; “we’re thinking, mother, what it is that baby
wants. For my part, with what’s about it, I can't see that it wants
anything.”
Grandmother BIB loved her son: but even she, filled to the lips
as she was with maternal tenderness, could not help smiling one of her
smiles upon him, that spoke a very eloquent volume of pity. She
merely said—“You can’t see 1 Of course not : how should you ?
But this comes of boys and girls marrying ! What should either of
you know " MRs. DAFFY said nothing : but it was plain she was
labouring at some withering reply. It was not her fault that she
could not speak a very pointed dagger: for it was evident that she
was violently hummaging her brain for such a weapon. Nothing,
however, came to hand: not even the dagger of wood that, in default
of steel, will sometimes present itself—a shabby substitute.
There was a short pause, and baby—no doubt, conscious of the
lull-improved the opportunity by giving another and another smack
with its lips. The sweet sound—the eloquent look of the child—for
a moment took down the dignity of Grandmother BIB : for, kissing
the child, and with a burst of eloquence that seemed rather a liberty
to Mits. DAFFY, the paternal grandmother said, “Bless its darling
rosebud of a mouth I Wants the precious pipkin I know what
it wants It’s salmon l’”
“Mas. BIR 1 " said Mas. DAFFY, in so many syllables; but her
meaning cried—“Foolish woman l’”
Heroically unmindful of the reproach, Grandmother B1R repeated
|
her opinion, strengthening it with an adjective, “Salmon! pickled
salmon I It was the same with its father 1"
“I should be very sorry to give any child of a daughter of mine
any such poison,” said Mas. Daffy. “Sorry, indeed, to have any.
thing of the sort on my conscience.” -
“I’m sure,” cried Grandmother Bin, “’tis the only thing will
satisfy it. If anything happens, I’ll answer for it.”
“Very good; very kind, indeed,” replied Mrs. DAFFY, digging
her words very politely at Mrs. BIB. “You’ll pardon me, but if
anything should happen to this child—my daughter's child—you'll
excuse me, but I should like to know how you would make it good,
indeed.”
“My dear ma'am—that is, Mas. DAFFY"—for Grandmother Bin
suddenly felt that she was becoming too familiar—“nothing can
happen to it. Look at the blessed creature;”—Baby was still
smacking its lips, tasting with great gust an imaginary something;-
“look at it. I know it's salmon;" and this opinion Grandmother Bib
delivered with an earnestness, a solemnity, that she intended to be
convincing—final.
At length Baby's father, MR. BIB, ventured to intrude a word.
He had been so remarkably well disciplined by the two grandmothers,
that he spoke upon the subject of his own child with a very respect
ful timidity. However, he did take heart, and prepared to have his
say. Whereupon, when his mother appealed to him, if the one
thing necessary for his infant’s peace of mind was not salmon-
pickled salmon—he begged, with the very greatest deference, to
differ from such opinion. “If there's anything in these whimsies
at all,” said the ignorant, unphilosophic father—“if a child really |
wants what its mother wished for ”—
“If I’’ exclaimed the two grandmothers—for once in concert, and
both looking on the man with pitying wonder—“If I "
“I should say that the thing at this moment nearest Baby's heart
was a real Cashmere shawl, and a box at the opera.” |
“How can you, Edward "said young Mas. Bib.
“I can't remember anything else,” said the very waggish Bih.
The two grandmothers, treating the unfeeling levity of the man
and the father with the full measure of contempt it merited, made
no further reply. They were, however, in no way to be diverted
from the interesting subject of their contest. Again they began the
battle; Grandmother BIB returning refreshed with a reinforcement
of pickled salmon, which Grandmother valiantly met with her roast
pig. The combat was supported with admirable energy on either
side: its subject, we trust, all unconscious lying in Mas. Darry's
lap. Happy babel Yes, we hope it knew nothing of either of the
experiments threatening its inward infancy. There it lay, fought
for by contending love . A tender sacrifice for killing kindness
It was plain, however, that Mas. Darry—who would enlist her
daughter on her side—must, in the end, carry the day. It was
plain, even to Grandmother BIB, that roast pig, as suggested by
MRs. Bib in our first chapter, must conquer. Whereupon she pre:
pared to retreat with dignity. Wrapping her shawl tightly about
her, she smiled very fiercely, and said— -
“Do as you like; of course you will. But you'll kill that child!
Good morning.”

THE CITY CIVIL WAR.
THE Blackfriars question seems likely to give quite as much trouble as
the American boundary affair; and it is to be regretted that in both cases
men speaking a common language—the language, by the bye, is dread-
fully common on the Thames—are brought into a hostile position. The
abusive language used towards the Watermen, by the Lond MAYor's
mercenaries, has been beyond all conception. The abuse has, however,
been the least part of the fearful hostility that has raged between the
rival combatants. The struggle has been fierce, and our correspondent
at the seat of war sends us letters which confirm our worst fears for the
peace of the river.
Blackfriars pier is already declared to be in a state of siege, and
Martial Law prevails over the whole line of coast, from the coal-
barge at the mouth of the common sewer, to the dummy moored off
Southwark.
The Lord MAYoº reminds us of Charles THE TENTH, sitting in his
easy chair, and dictating ordinances which are adding fuel to the flames
of a frightful revolution. He is lighting a fire upon every coal-barge ;
that is to say, in the hearts of the crew of that great commercial Marine,
which is as potential on the Thames as Britain herself is upon the
channel.
If the Lord Mayor once raises the spirit of revolt among the colliers,
it is a spirit that will not easily be allayed, for it cannot be afterwards
drowned in amicable beer, which only excites the passions it is intended to
swamp in the proffered liquor. The patriotism of the politician may be
cooled in friendly half-and-half, at the expense of his opponent, but the
ardour with which the bargeman clings to a cause he has once embraced
is only too proverbial.
We regret to find that the ambassadors of the Watermen have been
coldly received in the saloons of the Mansion House. We would tell
LoRd Johnson, in his proud and haughty justice seat, that the popular
feeling is against war, and woe will be to him who continues it. When
the Loan MAyor finds the whole of the Thames Navy arrayed against the
dredgers and the dregs whom he has collected under his dishonoured flag—
when he finds the enemy at his very gate-he will then—But it is
quite impossible for us to answer for the conduct of any LoRD MAYon,
and we therefore leave the sentence unfinished.

Eyeaybody is asking everybody else if anybody is exempt from the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CRUEL TREATMENT OF THE DUKE.
IELD-MARTIAL THE DUKE of
WELLINGTon has been hardly
judged by a stiff-necked gene-
ration. He has been either
honoured, or nicknamed—as
his Grace may take it—the
Iron Duke. For our own part,
- we should not consider it a
º compliment to be called Iron
SMITH-Iron Tom KINs—Iron
MUGGERIDGE — or whatever
our name might be ; we should
not, we say, care to have VUL-
cAN for our godfather, being
compelled to bear his iron for
life. The DUKE of WELLING-
Ton, however, has been much
wronged. This is evident from
a letter written by a corre-
spondent to the Post. Any less
awful authority we should, of
course, treat with indifference.
But the solemn man in the Post declares for the Duke, that “his
re-acceptance of office was forced upon him.” When we all know
the amiable weakness of his Grace—when we all feel his proneness
to be over-persuaded, our indignation is very much too great to
come out of any goosequill. And, gentle reader, “if you have
tears to shed, prepare them now.” If you feel any gratitude for
Badajoz and Waterloo, out with your pocket-handkerchief.
“Let us suppose a sovereign, justly beloved by her people, abandoned by her own
Cabinet, and deprived of the possibility of forming, another Cabinet, through the quar-
rels of the other party, harassed, perplexed, ‘beautiful, and in tears." Under such cir-
cumstances, the Duke of WELLINGroN, instead of being “the bravest of the brave,”
and the most chivalrous of the chivalrous, would have been the pilest of the vile if he
had deserted his sovereign.”
The “vilest of the vile” are, in reality, strong words; but they
look well in print, and when we remember where they are printed,
really mean nothing. But we put it to the dispassionate reader, if
the Duke had been made of the metal whereof it has been slander-
ously said he is manufactured, whether he would have given way.
Is it possible, even with royal tears, to “buy old iron 1* Had the
Duke been of such metal, would he not rather have come rusty
from HER MAJEsty But no : the Duke is not the Iron Duke, but
the Sugar Duke ; and, therefore, no wonder that, when tested by
tears, he melted
We cannot, however, comfortably contain our wrath at that
despot, PEEL It is plain that that man has no more heart about
him than the Jack of Clubs, for we are solemnly asked, What—yes,
what—
“What are we to think of the despotism of a Premier, who instead of being struck
with compunction at the result of his own dereliction of principle, should avail himself
of the noble sentiments of his former colleagues in office, and refuse to modify his
opinions, and compel them to re-enter office, impelled by their loyal and chivalrous
feelings, upon his own terms, and at the expense of their own opinions, and sense of
public duty?”
Well, we confess it: we do not know what to think of the despot
PEEL We are lost, and would give any money for even the
smallest thought; just so much as to swear by. But no; we give
PEEL up. All our compassion—all our feelings are engaged by the
Sugar Duke. We weep sympathetic drops of saccharine, as we
picture the mild, the timid WELLING Ton, about to quietly shrink
from Downing Street, nevertheless stopt by the tyrannic PEEL,
who compels the meek, the gentle Duke, to return to his Office,
even as a blustering pedagogue drives a little boy to school.
Hostages for America.
(From the Morning Post.)
We have the following intelligence from a gentleman who is intimately
acquainted with an individual in the confidence of the EARL of ABER-
DEEN's butler, that, immediatel y on the declaration of war by the Yankees,
Miss Cush MAN and her sister will be consigned to the Tower, as American
subjects. It is thought that the Americans will commit reprisals by
taking off the head of CHARLEs KEAN. . We can only tell them that if they
do, they will take nothing by their motion.
THE POLITICAL AUTOMATON CHESS-PLAYER.
ONE of the wonders of mechanism, is an automaton chess-player;
which has astonished the world by the facility with which it beat
everybody, though it was obvious that, being a mere automaton, he
could only be playing some one else's game. The secret was even-
tually discovered to consist in the fact that a Monsieuh MoURET
pulled certain strings, which directed the game of the puppet, and
enabled him to defy all opposition. One of the greatest wonders of
the age is, however, the great political chess-player, SIR Roseat
PEEL ; who makes a series of the most successful moves,"none of
which are the result of his own skill, but are suggested entirely by
others. His last grand move, in which he was very near giving
check to the QUEEN, and by which he forfeited some of his best
pawns—when we say pawns, we mean, of course, pledges—was
dictated by Cobden, who has lately been to the political automaton
what Monsieur Mouhet was to the original chess-player. This
move very nearly lost him the QUEEN's Castle, and will subject him
to a sharp attack from the Knights and Bishops on the other side;
but there is no doubt he will, with his usual good luck, succeed in
bringing Cobden's game to a successful issue.
BREACH OF PROMISE.-PROTECTION versus PEEL.
Unsuant to notice this cause came on
yesterday before MR. Justice Punch,
and a special jury. Damages were
laid at 30,000,000l.
MR. Blusten stated the case to the
jury. The plaintiff in this action was
a young lady of great charms and
personal accomplishments, connected
with some of the highest members
of the aristocracy. The defendant
was a statesman of eminence. For a
long series of years he had paid his
addresses to the plaintiff, with the
full sanction of her parents and
ardians.
them. He had gained her heart
only to throw it away. Like the school-boy captor of the butterfly,
he possessed himself of the prize but to crush it. In 1842 he began to
display symptoms of coldness towards that being who had so adored him.
In 1846 he had consummated his treachery by giving his hand to another.
He (MR. BLUsTER) would now produce proofs of the engagement which
had been entered into by defendant with plaintiff. [The learned
counsel here produced several letters and public speeches of the defend-
ant's, the reading of which caused much merriment in Court.]
The jury were to judge of the feelings which rent her bosom when the
confiding creature found at leng h that all these solemn vows were broken
and scattered to the winds. . [Here the learned gentleman, in glowing
terms, described the anguish of his client.]... For feelings thus lacer.
ated, what compensation could be given His client's views were not
mercenary; but he would call on the gentlemen of the jury, as men,
and Britons, to mark, by their verdict, their sense of the defendant's
heartlessness., , , º
The learned barrister then called the Dukes of Richmond and Buck-
INGHAM, Ma. D'IshAELI, several other Members of Parliament, and some
reporters, in proof both of the promise and its alleged infraction.
MR. Pugh, for the defendant, pooh-poohed the allegations for the
plaintiff. He denied, in the first place, that she was a young lady at all ;
and maintained, on the contrary, that she was a decrepit old woman. He
ridiculed the idea of her possessing any charms or attractions, and de-
scribed her as unenviable and repulsive in the extreme. He should be
sorry to impute wilful falsehood to his learned friend, but his learned
friend must have known that his statements were opposed to truth.
far from being the confiding, attached young creature that his friend had
depicted her, the plaintiff was notoriously an antiquated flirt. He could
not deny that a rash promise had been made by his client ; but circum-
stances over which he had no control obliged him to take the course he
had adopted. He acted from a sense of duty. England expected every
man to do his duty. He hoped the gentlemen of the jury would, on this
occasion, do theirs. He trusted they would not allow an unwary youth
to become the victim of a designing old spinster and her attorney; and,
though he must admit that the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict, he was
sure that the smallest coin of the realm would be an ample compensation
for any injury she had sustained.
MR. Justice Punch briefly summed up; and the jury, after a moment's
consultation, returned a verdict for the plaintiff-Damages, Half a
Farthing.
But, alas ! he had won
er affections only to trifle with

WAR WITH AMERICA.
HE venerable Quincey ADAMs—
with one foot in the grave,
stamps the other on the floor
of the senate, and cries out
for war! “Who’d have
thought the old man had so
much blood in him 1" The
morals, too, of the old gen-
tleman are rather more cu-
rious than elevated. He
advises that Oregon should
first be seized by the Ameri-
cans, and then be negociated
for; at which touch of true
transatlantic humour there
was “much laughter.” We
have no doubt that merriment akin to this has shaken the walls of
many a “fence.” We can understand that the fellows who stole
the gold-dust may have jocosely said to themselves, “We’ll first
nim the swag” (we believe such to be the words, if not, let Ains-
worth correct us), “and then we can negociate 1”
Ma. Adams continued, “That is the military way of doing busi-
ness;” at which there was “increased merriment.” Jocose law-
makers! Wise...MR. ADAMs Morals — common honesty — the
decencies of civilised intercourse—are to be forgotten, set aside as
impertinent—inconvenient to the ambition of the young republic
that was to teach a lesson (How has she blundered at it—how mise-
rably mis-spelt it !) to the nations. “The military way 1” Here is
an old, old man—one who has certainly won the respect and admira-
tion of the world in by-gone years, casting off his fair reputation as a
statesman—“like a wrestler's garland”—and propounding the doc-
trines of a brigand. “The military way!” Yes; the way of robbery
and bloodshed—the way of burglary in uniform, and murder with
floating colours “The military way !” Yes! bullets for words;
cold steel for calm discussion. The bully Might bestriding and in-
sulting feeble Right.
And then MR. An AMs told a story of FREDER1ck THE GREAT.
How that the said FaedERick—in “the military way,” seized upon
an Austrian province. The highwayman way and the military way
very often differ only in this. In one case it is only one man who
presents a pistol, in the other it is twenty thousand with muskets.
If the one man be taken, he is a villain and is hanged: If the twenty
thousand are victorious, they are heroes, and with faces “just like
these harlotry players,” go to church and perform Te Deum. The
way of the great FREDERick, as quoted by MR. ADAMs, was wholly
of this complexion. Had the achievement been lessened to a solitary
act committed by a solitary man, the act and the man might have
been duly chronicled in every Newgate Calendar. And has age taught
Mn. ADAMs no better wisdom? Can his grey hairs bequeath nothing
better to humanity than war—wicked, foolish war 1 Will he lie more
calmly in the earth because drenched with blood? We pity him;
we mourn for him; for he has disappointed us.
America, however, like England, has her political mountebanks—
made, in the bounty of Nature, only to be laughed at. Of these is
the Honour ABLE–(how these republicans, sorry are we to say it,
sniff about the edge of a title)—the Honoun ABLE | FELIx G.
M’Conn ELL. He moved “the adoption of resolutions for the annex-
ation of Ireland l’” What modesty—what more than American
shamefacedness When you have Ireland, as you're so near to us,
why not “annex” England too !
The Corn-Law Fight.
THE terrible Post says—
“. It is not so the battle of Protection must be fought. It must be fought calmly but
boldly, and fought, if need be, inch by inch.”
Would it not be at once more heroic and more agricultural to say,
“barley-corn by barley-corn ?"
StreeT CHRISTENING.
WE learn from the French papers that a new street has been built in
Paris called the Rue D'Isly. We advise our lively neighbours to
christen their next street the Rue d'Abd-el-Kader, for that is their only
chance, we think, of ever seeing him in the streets of Paris.

TO H. R. H. PRINCE ALBERT.
#T.WE wish the Windsor and Clewer parochial authorities much joy of
the gratuity which His Royal HIGHNess PRINCE ALBERT has been
graciously pleased to present them with—the amount of the poor's rate
of Flemish Farm, which certain mistaken HAMPDENs in the neighbour-
hood had presumed to demand, as a right. ... We greatly admire the
profound spirit of humility which dictated theiraddress to His Royal
Highness, disclaiming all art and part in the doings of their audacious
fellow-townsmen; but we cannot help thinking that it would have been
more happily expressed somewhat in the manner following :- -
“May it please your Royal Highness. . We, the undersigned, with
awe and reverence, fear and trembling, shivering and shaking in our
shoes, humbly venture to approach your Royal Highness's footstool, and
lowly kneeling thereat, to kiss the boot of your Royal Highness.
“With mingled feelings of shame, and dread, and consternation, we con-
fess, on our knees, to your Royal Highness, that welhave the misfortune
of belonging to the same parishes with persons who, in seeking to levy
a poor's rate on Flemish Farm, have dared to attempt to enforce against
3. Royal Highness what they, in their blindness, considered to be
the law.
“But we assure your Royal Highness, and we beg, and pray, and en-
treat you to believe, that beside belonging, unhappily, to the same
parish, we have no fellowship, concern, or connexion whatever with those
misguided men. We, therefore, prostrate in the º beseech your
Royal Highness that you will vouchsafe to distinguish between us and
them, and will not overwhelm, with your princely disapprobation, our
innocent selves and our guilty neighbours alike.
“Some of us, dread Prince, are butchers, some bakers, grocers, shoe-
makers, tailors. We are unspeakably afraid that your Royal Highness,
thinking that we, possibly, may have had something to do with the un-
pardonable proceedings of those persons, may, in your just wrath and
indignation, withhold from us a portion of your custom, and that the
Court, in loyal sympathy with your Royal Highness, willimitate your Royal
example. Wherefore, at the feet of your Royal Highness, and before
the whole world, we hereby not only renounce and disclaim all participa-
tion in their acts and deeds, but protest, from our hearts, that we utterly
detest and abhor them. And we implore your Royal Highness not to
avert from us the light of your Princely patronage, but to grant us, your
suppliants, a continuance of your gracious favours. - -
* With the deepest sense of humiliation, blushing for our offending neigh-
bours, we gratefully thank your Royal Highness for the munificent and
unmerited boon which you have bestowed upon our unworthy parishes.
And we joyfully acknowledge that it was not the value of the money, but
the principle of the thing that inspired your Royal bosom with resistance
to a presumptuous vestry. In conclusion, we declare, in all sincerity,
that whatever might have been the law in this matter, we should as soon
have thought of taking it of your Royal Highness as we should of taking
the wall. And so in all lowliness we subscribe ourselves,
“The humblest of your Royal Highness's
“HUMBLE SERVANTS.”
Mildness of the season.
Mn. Wodehouse, on the evening SIR Robear PEEL brought forward
the statement for the repeal of the Corn Laws, found the House of Com-
mons so very oppressive, that he was obliged two or three times, during
the heat of the debate, to go into the lobby to breathe *:: Later in the
evening he rallied a little, and addressed the House. His friends were
apprehensive of an attack, for the warmth he was labouring under was
too evident. Their fears, however, were groundless, for his speech was
remarkable for its extreme coolness. .
Better LATE THAN NEVER,
We take the following rapturous intelligence from the daily papers :-
“Mr. LEADER, M.P. for Westminster, has arrived in town from his chateau in the
South of France."
Several of his constituents have testified their joy by an illumination.
At one house—we forget the number and the street—we read the follow-
ing words in brilliant lamps. “Welcome, little Stranger 1"
Court Irony.
The Duke of Richmond has asked “Why MR. Cobden is not made a
Peer " We can at once detect the artifice of his Grace. He would
raise Cobden to the Peerage, as he feels the only chance of making him
powerless and ridiculous, is to make him—a DUKE.

the Apollonicon now growls, and odorous flowers on the mossy bank,
where PALMER now manufactures his candles. The whole of this
part of the Metropolis was originally a rural district ; and it is even
believed that—such was the savage wildness of the spot—bears were
known to prowl about that part of it to which the name of Bear Street
has since been given. Leicester Fields, as they were then called, formed
the grand centre for the meeting of the hounds, and the loud cry of
“Hilly holyo hoicks 1 hilly high hoſ” was accustomed to reverberate
up Leicester Place, across Newport Market, and right away over the
hills of Holborn.
This brings us again to Whetstone Park, the subject of our present
visit. It was formerly the abode of the Earls of Whetstone, who were
collaterally related to the Barons of Turnstile, who lived in great style :
since corrupted into Great Turnstile, in the neighbourhood. It is well
known to all our legal readers—or if it is not, it ought to be—that no
place can be called a park, without a royal license; and it is said that
the first Earl of Whetstone extorted from ETHELRed the right to call his
domain of Whetstone a Park, as the price of some secret service
rendered to the Saxon monarch in the wars of Wessex. The place has
not preserved its park-like appearance, but it has still some remains of
the sylvan symplicity by which a park would probably be distinguished.
The cat nestles undisturbed amid the quiet chimney-pots; the hen leads
her little brood about in security; and the horse pokes his head out of
the stable-door with a calm sense of security. The aspect of the place
proves, that even as
“You may break, you may ruin the vase if you will,
But the scent of the roses will linger there still.”
So you may build over the park grounds as you may ; still the relics of
rusticity will haunt its gutters, and cling to its tiled roofs, its clothes-
lines, its children, and its chickens, for ever.
Some of our readers may not perhaps be acquainted with the geography
of Whetstone Park, which is a narrow neck of land—as they say of the
Isthmus of Suez—lying between the northern continent of Holborn and
the Lincoln's Inn southern hemisphere. It has been said that there is no
part of the British dominions on which the sun never shines; but Whet-
stone Park, from the height of its buildings, and its own narrowness, is
decidedly extra-solarly situated. It was formerly the residence of those
generous-hearted and fineold English gentlemen who never could see a fel-
low-creature in distress without offering to become his bail, and who took the
name of Straw Bail, from the notion perhaps of straw being usually in the
truss; and the trust they put in their fellow man was really wonderful.
They used to stand at Sergeant's Inn, thrusting into every one's hands
their cards inscribed with their names and addresses; the majority of
those addresses being Whetstone Park, in the County of Middlesex.
These bail, like many other of our venerable institutions, have been
swept away by the besom of Reform, aided by a few twigs in the birch of
the Schoolmaster. Where are they now Echo, alas ! must answer as
it used when these bail were called upon to justify—“Where f"

THE GRESHAM LECTURES.
These Lectures have hitherto been carried on as a
téte-a-téte between the Beadle and the Professor, in some-
thing like the following style:—
Professor (strolling in). Well, beadle !
Beadle. Well, sir!
Professor. Anybody been, beadle?
Beadle. Been, sir? No! nor they ain't never likely 1

The Plush manuscript finishes here : it is many weeks since we saw the accomplished
writer, and we have only just learned his fate. We are happy to state it is a comfort-
able and almost a prosperous one.
| The Honorable and Right Reverend Lionel. Thistlewood, Lord Bishop of Bullock-
'smithy, was mentioned as the uncle of Lady Angelina Silverror. Her elopement with her
cousin, caused deep emotion to the venerable prelate: he returned to the palace at
Bullocksmithy, of which he had been for thirty years the episcopal ornament, and where
he ºried three wives, who lie buried in his, Cathedral Church of St. Boniface, Bullock-
smithy.
The admirable man has rejoined those whom he loved. As he was preparing a charge
to his clergy in his study after dinner, the Lord Bishop fell suddenly down in a fit of
apoplexy 3 his butler, bringing in his accustomed dish of devilled-kidneys for supper, dis-
covered the venerable form extended on the Turkey carpet with a glass of Madeira in
his hand; but life was extinct ; and surgical aid was therefore not particularly useful.
All the late prelate's wives had fortunes, which the admirable man increased by thrift,
the judicious sale of leases which fell in during his episcopacy, &c. He left three
hundred thousand pounds—divided between his nephew and niece—not a greater sum
than has been left by several deceased Irish prelates.
What Lond Southdown has done with his share we are not called upon to state. He
has composed an epitaph to the Martyr of Bullocksmithy, which does him infinite credit.
But we are happy to state that Lady Angelina Silvertop presented five hundred
pounds to her faithful and affectionate servant, MARY ANN Hoggins, on her marriage
with MR. JAMEs Plush, to whom her Lady ship also made a handsome present—namely,
the lease, good-will, and fixtures of the “Wheel of Fortune” public-house, near Sheppherd's
Market, May Fair; a house greatly frequented by all the nobility's footmen, doing a
genteel stroke of business in the neighbourhood, and where, as we have heard, the “But-
lers' Club” is held.
Here Ma. Plush lives happy in a blooming and interesting wife: reconciled to a mid-
dle sphere of life, as he was to a humbler and a higher one before. He has shaved off
body never comes, unless it’s a few boys, and I always
turns them out !
Professor. Ha! you're a wag.
Beadle. I need be a wag here, sir; for there's nothing
else to do. If I wasn't a bit of a wag, sir, I'm sure
I don't know what would have become of me long ago.
Professor (going out). Ha, ha! good morning.
[Erit Professor.
Beadle (singing). “How wery ridiculous.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes; it is wery ridiculous.”
Such has been usuallythe scene at the Gresham Lectures;
but the other day, by some extraordinary accident, there
was a rush of fifty persons, to hear MR. PALMER on
Law, but MR. PALMER not having anticipated that there
would have been any anxiety to hear his lecture, had,
with becoming modesty, stopped away altogether. The
unfortunate beadle was at length compelled to come for-
ward and brave public indignation, and he will hencefor-
ward be known in the City as
“The beadle that weather'd the storm.”
We presume that MR. PALMER will go prepared, on the
next occasion, to edify a large audience, when he will
probably find no audience to edify. It is certainly very
puzzling to a professor to know what to do when he
usually finds himself “alone in his glory,” and at another
time hears of an enormous influx of intended auditors to
his proposed lecture.
State Economy and Principle.
It is a fact, speaking much for the economy of the
Royal household, and the consistency of several of its
humblest officers, that the Royal coachmen, footmen,
and grooms, in the department of the Master of the
Horse have, until a week since, worn the same state
coats for twenty years! Yes, astonished reader; the
same coats for twenty years; and what is more, though
attached to the Government they have never once turned

& Dan in the Common 33leas.
UMouns have long prevailed that the busi-
ness is not equally distributed among
the Common Law Courts; and that
while the Queen's Benchand Exchequer
are overburdened with business, the
Court of Common Pleas has almost,
literally, nothing to do. Being desirous
of ascertaining if such is actually the
case, we determined on visiting the
scene of action—if the Common Pleas
can be called the scene of any actions
at all. We made up our minds to pass
a whole day in this judicial temple, in
which we had heard that Justice was
positively in danger of famishing for
want of food. We had heard that there
is so seldom a bone (of contention)
thrown down to it to be gnawed, that
starvation, must ensueunless something
is done to increase its amount of legal
nourishment. An attempt, it is true,
has recently been made to give the
hungry Court an occasional repast
of the crumbs that fall from the revising barristers'
in the shape
present history. Suddenly the Chief broke, with patriarchal dignity, the
silence that had prevailed. “In the n.atter of Doe, on the Devise of
Nobody against Somebody,” he exclaimed, with solemn earnestness—and
every ear was strained to eight times its usual length to catch the observ-
ations of the old judicial chieftain.—“We have been considering the
point reserved,” he continued, “and shall be in a condition to give judg:
ment some day in some other term.” There is a momentary pause: the
usher looks wistfully round him, and the Judge's clerk turns his eyes
inquiringly up towards the clock. Again the solemn tones of the Chief
Justice are heard pealing over the benches, and climbing up into the
vaulted roof, exclaiming, “We shall sit again to-morrow, at ten.”
The judges wend their way back over the romantic little platform, and
are soon lost behind the recesses of the curtain of scarlet cloth. The
Counsel disappear at different doorways; the ushers wipe the ink from
the pens, which the juniors have been using for the miniatures of the
Judges drawn upon the desks; and the Court of Common Pleas—
“Like the baseless fabric of a vision,
Leaves not a ruck behind.”
registration tables; but we had heard that these were gobbled up in a few º
days, and that the Court was then left without the smallest sustenance.
The following report, which we give literally, of a day in the Common
Pleas, will confirm the very worst accounts of the destitution of that
tribunal. The whole scene is so like a piece of fiction, that we have
adopted the tone and manner of the novelistin describing it. We flatter
ourselves that the ensuing chapter of legal romance, is quite as good as
anything that Bulwen or Ainsworth could have done with the same
materials.
CHAPTER FIRST AND LAST.
Atten o’clock, one fine morning in last Hilary Term, the usher might
be seen wending his way from behind the curtain of the Court of Common
Pleas, and performing his accustomed duties by arranging the pens and
filling the inkstands. In a few minutes a middle-aged stranger sauntered
towards the reporters' box, and having whistled an air, he sat down to
prepare the book which contained his notes. The stranger and the usher &

iooked at each other for an instant, but neither of them spoke a word. is
Looming moodily through the background, a heavy junior, whose light
horse-hair wig contrasted with the rusty blackness of the bombazine
which formed his gown, came sauntering into the Court, and, with an eye
indignantly flashing at nothing in particular, he took his seat on the back
row. He was evidently a disappointed man, whose visions of the woolsack
had been shrouded by the bag of brieflessness. Presently he was joined
by two companions, both as moody and as briefless as himself. The
learned trio did not salute each other, but plunged at once into a broken
conversation, in which they mutually agreed that there was no talent in
the front ranks of the bar. Genius, according to them, was born to fume
unheard, or waste its talent on a mere compute, handed in from the back
rows over the coifed heads of men of inferior ability. In a few moments
four or five serjeants straggled in listlessly, and began reading the Times,
talking about the weather, or something else of less exciting interest. A
shriek from the usher of “Silence, pray silence," created a momentary
sensation in the Court, and the Cºief Justice, followed by three of the
puisnes, might be seen crossing the little platform that runs by the side of
the romantic little Jury-box, and loses itself on the Bench. A bow of
mutual recognition between the Counsel and the Judges, proclaims that
happy harmony which prevails in the profession from the highest to the
lowest grade.
By this time a knot of idle spectators—amounting, perhaps, to six—had
gathered at the back of the Court, which they had entered—for the only
reason that any one ever enters the Common Pleas—because they had no
business there. In conformity with the admirable judicial custom which
prevails in our happy land, the Chief Justice asked the four or five ser:
jeants, in rotation, if they had anything to move, when four or five stiff
bows were the only answer given. Suddenly there is a bustling of feet,
a rustling of silk, a banging of doors, and another serjeant springs into the
front row. Everyone looks with eagerness to the spot, when the serjeant,
raising his arm, and holding a piece of paper in his hand, demands that
the casual ejector may be submitted to the judgment of the Court. The
Chief Justice interrupts a stream of forensic eloquence which is about to
be poured down upon him, by the simple ejaculation, “Brother! you may
take your rule,” and the Court becomes suddenly as hushed as it had
been a moment before.
Many of our readers may have known that moment of doubt, that
instant of intense interest, when one don't exactly know what is to happen
next. Such seemed to be the feeling indicated by the faces of every one
in the Common Pleas at the moment to which we have brought our
It is with all those feelings which a penny-a-liner experiences when
spinning out his report of a calamity to the utmost possible extent-
it is, we say, with the most painful feeling of commiseration that we an-
nounce the bursting of the Great Railway Bubble, which took place under
the most appalling circumstances a few days ago. We regretto state that
a total exhaustion of the receiver, which created a fearful vacuum,
was the immediate cause of the frightful calamity.
The alarm had been spread some time ago, which occasioned a panie
among those who were within the sphere of the great Bubble; but it
seems that the poor unfortunate wretches were unable to escape in time
from the danger in which they had imprudently placed themselves.
Immediately on the Bubble bursting, the rush of cold water was so
tremendous, that several hundreds of railway lines were swamped in an
instant. Some few which relied upon their being placed on solid ground,
and felt themselves secure in the supposed solidity of their stratum,
consisting of a primary deposit, were not affected by the first blow; but
on examination it was found that this deposit had been gradually eaten
away by some birds of prey with long bills, so that these lines have since
been involved in the common ruin.
We have endeavoured to ascertain the extent of the calamity, but
almost every day adds to the long list of casualties. Some of the lines
have been literally crushed beneath an enormous weight that has been
thrown down upon them, which they are quite unable to bear up against.
Some of the defunct schemes were found clinging together, as if in
their dying struggle they had sought safety by leaning upon one another
for support, and actual amalgamation had taken place, in the desperate
energy with which they had clung to each other for assistance. The
scene altogether is one of the most distressing that can be conceived.
Some few of the lines that yet survive are so fearfully shaken, that it will
be fortunate for them when dissolution puts an end to their convulsive
existence.

MRS. BIB’S BABY.
HERE's Master's mother,
Mas. BIB, has sent to
º, know, how baby is, if
Tº you please, ma'am,” said
Becky, the next morning.
“And she begs to say,
that she wouldn't take
the freedom to inquire,
only that how she's had
a dream. What, if you
please, shall I tell the
girl, ma'am!”
“That woman's al-
ways dreaming,” cried
Mrs. DAFFY. “And did
she say nothing else?”
“Only , this, ma'am ;
that if JoANNA saw the
house shut up, she wasn't
to inquire at all—but to
go back as fast as her
legs would carry her.
That’s what JoANNA
told me of herself,
ma'am.”
“SARAH,” said MRs.
DAFFY to her daughter,
sinking her voice to a
somewhat solemn pitch, and playing with her fingers on Baby's back as though
Baby was a piano—the Baby answering the fingering as if its treble keys alone
were struck. “SARAH, it's my belief there's some people wouldn't care if even
death came into a house, so that some people's words might seem to come true.
Mrs. BiB is your dear husband's mother, and therefore, of course, I shall say
nothing; it isn't likely. But if ever there was a woman to bring mischief
into a house-not that it's any affair of mine; none. Nevertheless, I can
see it; we can't help having one's eyes—she looks at me as if I was an inter-
loper. Now, if it was her daughter's child, I think I should know my place.”
And here Mas. DAFFY, addressing the screaming infant, bawled out, “I think
I should—a dear!”
“It can't be well;-it never would cry so—I’m sure it can’t be well,” said
young MRs. BIB, her countenance shadowed and anxious.
“Wind, SARAH-nothing but wind,” averred Mas. Daffy, and still she
played on Baby's back, and looked heroically about her like one invulnerable to
the screams of infants. They might do their worst, and still was she serene
and deaf to them.
“I’m certain, mother, it can't be well,” said sweet Mas. BIB, looking all
the sweeter for the mother's look that perplexed her pretty face. “If any.
thing should happen to it.”—
“Ha! that's just like you, child. I wonder how I should have brought all
of you up, if I’d been half as foolish. Tell Mas. Bib"—here Mas. Daffy
turned to Becky, hallooing through Baby's screams—“tell MRs. BIB that
Baby's charming; a little fractious, that's all; and Becky”—this was given as
private and confidential—“not a word about the pig.”
In our last chapter, we expressed a belief that Mas. Daffy would carry
her point, and—in such matters she was not a woman to be baulked—a frag-
ment of roast pig had been silently, stealthily procured, Becky being the sworn
Purveyor, on the occasion, and secretly administered to the yearning infant;
that, in its eager relish of the morsel, gave tremendous evidence of the sagacity
of Mas. Darry. Great, indeed, was the satisfaction—sweet the triumph
of that wise woman—as she looked down upon Baby, sucking the pig as
yehemently as the pig itself had ever sucked its parent. Fragmentary but
beautiful were the sentences addressed by Grandmother to Babe, some of
which went to assure the infant that “it was a love—a pig-a-wiggy—the pig of
pigs itself.”
...And Baby was, in due season—but after long sucking at the sweet, por-
cine morsel–satisfied, and with greasy lips, and little shining cheeks, sub-
sided into deep sleep. Poor little fellow I this was its first transgression; its
first outbreak from a milk diet—from the sweet simplicity of nature—to feast
upon the flesh-pots of a fallen, carnivorous world. This was the first time that
death had administered to its life—this the first morsel that, with all its delicate
flavour, nevertheless smacked of the fall of man,—albeit Baby smacked its
lips, luxuriously unconscious of the disgrace of his first father. This the first
tit-bit of the thousands and thousands of various joints, and steaks, and
chops, and merry-thoughts, and wings “to follow”— |
things that, to the eye of a philosopher, make adult,
bow-bellied man, seem no other than a sort of
breathing, human Noah's Ark; a machine carrying
transformed within it always two of every living
thing.
Prophetic imagination looking down upon Baby Bib
-its lips still wet and beaded with its first sweet sin of
animal flesh—might parcel out its little body, even as
cattle-breeders parcel out Smithfield, as a future tem-
porary abiding-place for oxen, and calves, and sheep,
and pigs. What a living cattle-market in little had
Grandmother, DAFFY on her knees, and yet—good
thick soul l—how very distant from her the thought
of it !
But beautiful is the regularity, the clock-work of
nature; and certain and severe the penalty on man
for playing tricks with it. Though Bacchus himself
over night lend you his thyrsus to advance the hands
and push on the hours, it is ten to one that in the
morning, you will have a smart knock upon the head
for your boldness: and even if the knock be delayed,
why it is only deferred that it may pay itself with
interest, all the single knocks coming down in after
years, as double ones. For time—when it trusts at all
—takes huge interest of intemperance.
“Now, bless me ! what is all this about—and what
can it have to do with an infant eating pig t” With
ears quite long enough to hear into next week, when
these scratches shall be made legible by type, we hear
many female voices—silveriest sounds, when silver 1–
asking this. We will answer ; we will show, from the
after-confession of Baby BIB itself, what infants may
suffer from early dissipation, when forced upon their
innocence by bad—that is, by ignorant—company.
Baby Bib fastened hold of the roast pig as the one
sole thing of this multitudinous world—the one dear,
mysterious object—the sweet unknown—that in its
long experience of the earth—for it was more than a
month-old citizen of the globe—it had yearned, and
grieved for. No sooner had Baby the morsel in its lips,
than all the common-places about it (for time and cus-
tom had made all things very dull and usual) grew and
changed into beauty. Its own grandmother—Mrs.
DAFFY-was very soon an altered person; her dull
yellow face shone with golden lustre; her cap seemed
like a cloud of glory; and her incomprehensible gib-
berish, invented by nurses for the especial purpose of
insulting babies, was most delightful—most eloquent
harmony. , Baby BIB —still sucking the pig-sank
pleased, melted, soaked in delight to sleep. The little
creature was drunk with satisfaction.
But babies, like men, must pay a common penalty.
How beautiful would be the bottle, if there was no
to-morrow morning in it ! Baby BIB, by foolish com-
pany, had been forced into dissipation; had been at
once tempted and compelled into a debauch—its first
transgression—and it awoke in a condition that pro-
bably the reader inay much more readily conceive than
our pen—for we write with only the quill of a goose,
temperate waterfowl as it is—can express. Baby had
the bile : Baby's head ached; Baby's eyes were fixed
like the eyes of a dead fish; Baby looked heavily at all
things about it, and saw strange characters written
upon them : odd marks that were not there last night.
The forms of these new things, however, remained in
Baby's memory; strange, cabalistic marks, that even
now move much of the world. Baby—become a man
– has since put them down; and they run somehow
thus:-º.84 ſta.s.la.G.
And then Baby—not having yet learned to disguise
the effects of its intemperance—began to scream, and
clench its little fists—and turn purple—and hold its
breath, as though it was Baby's own property, and it
would not give it up, let them smack its back as they
would. And in this disreputable condition, for the
present, we leave it.

showing how PREL went FURTHER THAN HE INTENDED, AND came
SAFE HOME AGAIN.
Of credit and renown ;
And eke, by virtue of his place,
Adviser to the Crown.
Now Richard CoBDEN said to him,
“Protected Corn has been
Thro’ thrice ten tedious years, since eight-
Teen hundred and fifteen.
“Yet landlords and eke tenants say
Of profits they despair;
Despite Protection, growing corn
Is a losing affair.
“There’s MR. BRight, and there's myself,
Aud MR. Fox—make three ;
We've raised a League, and you must ride
(As BEN says) after we.”
Said PEEL, “Your doctrines I admire,
- But I am only one ;
Still, if the Duke will stick to me,
rºll try what can be done.
"I am a Premier stout and bold,
As all my party know ;
And my good friends in Manchester
Will lend their horse to go.”
Now see him in his new Tariff,
On Free Trade—noble steed 1
Full slowly taking duties off,
With caution and good heed.
Then came the blight, and fears arose
We’d not have food to eat,
Free Trade, from walking, 'gan to trot,
Which shook PEEL in his seat.
“Fairly and softly,” PEEL he cried,
But PEEL he cried in vain;
The trot became a gallop soon,
And Free Trade flew amain.
Then giving up, as needs he must
Who cannot help his plight.
PEEL seized Free Trade, and like a shot
Flew past Protection quite.
Free Trade, who by a Tory lord
Had ne'er been cross'd before,
What thing upon his back had got
Did wonder more and more.
Away went Robert-neck or nought
Past Radical and Whig ;
He little thought when he began
His bill would be so big.
The Post did bark, the Herald scream’d,
Out spoke the farmers all,
And every Duke cried out “For shame!”
As loud as he could bawl.
Away went Robert I Who but he
Free Trade still gaining ground,
He carries weight—he'll win his race,
His horse's wind is sound.
~ Robert was a Minister
w
Still, as Division-day drew near
'Twas wonderful to view
How overboard the men in place
Their old convictions threw.
Thro' manufactures of all kinds
His gambols he did play,
And came to Corn Laws at the last,
Which stood dead in the way.
The sliding-scale he knock’d about
Unto his friends' dismay,
And fix’d how that at three years' end
The tax should die away.
Free Trade, not satisfied at all
To wait for three years more,
Straight gallopp'd off with all his might,
As he had done before.
Away went Robert, with the Leagu
Still thundering at his heel,
Insisting loud in total and
Immediate repeal.
The county members in the House,
Thus seeing Robert fly,
With Lord John Russell in his rear,
Set up a hue and cry:
“Stop thief 1 Stop thief a highway man:”
Not one of them was mute,
And Ben D'IshAELI and Colquhoun
Did join in the pursuit.
In the “Protection” heavy coach,
The Upper House gave chase;
But Free Trade's bottom, bone, and wind,
Made it a hopeless race.
The race is run, the race is won
With credit and renown ;
Nor did Free Trade draw breath until
The Corn Laws he ran down.
Now let us sing Long live the League,
And Cobden, long live he ;
And when Peel next doth ride Free Trade,
May Punch his Laureat be.
THE BAD ENGLISH PARLIAMENT.
The English Parliament, we believe, is supposed to express itself in the
English language. In the opinion, however, of a competent judge, this
supposition is questionable ; for JUDGE ALDERson, the other day, in the
Court of Exchequer, on the trial of the case Young v. Smith, re.
marked, respecting the 26th section of 7 & 8, Victonia, c. 110,—the Joint
Stock Companies Act,
“That Clause is generally the most unintelligible in the whole Act; and is not unlike
some interpreters, who speak such bad English as to puzzle one more than the language
of the party interpreted.”
Both the Lords and Commons have standing rules; but these do not
seem to include the rules of Syntax. We propose that these rules should
be inscribed, by way of legends, on the walls of the interior of the new
Houses of Parliament, where, handsomely emblazoned in old English cha-
racters, they would form very appropriate decorations. As, for instance,
“Ye Nominative Case governs ye verb, and replies to ye Question Who!
or What? with Ye Werb,” “Conjunctions, copulative and disjunctive, con-
nect similar Moods, Cases, and Tenses;" or, “Ye Relative agrees with Je |
Antecedent in Gender, Number, and Person.”
When Parliament turns over a new leaf in the Statute Book, which we
hope, on more accounts than one, that it will do when it gets into its new
houses, let us trust that the sentences committed to the fresh page will
accord with the above-mentioned axioms. ADAM SMITH is a parliamentary
authority; why not LINDLEY MURRAY : To the list of officers of the
Lords and Commons, it would really be desirable to add a grammarian, to
be entitled Professor of Plain English. His duty should consist in putting
their enactments into an intelligible form ; and surely, so many charity
boys as there are in the kingdom, there are plenty who would undertake
it for a trifle.
.A. Great Idea.
It will be recollected that MR. B. D'Israeli said that SIR Robert PEEL
was not a fit Premier, because he had not a “great idea.” In the event
of a resignation, HER MAJESTY has determined to offer the Premiership
to MR. D'IshAELI, as being, by his own definition, the beau idéal of a
great statesman : for it is evident that no man, in the course of history,
ever had a greater idea—of himself.
THE STAG'S RETREAT.
The French of Boulogne, not understanding the meaning of the word
“stag,” have nicknamed the aldermen who have run over to their town
for refuge, “Cerfs-volants.” This translation is not so bad, especially
as the flight of the aldermen was probably hastened by the very process
of kite-flying.

of Aldermen, who having ex-
hausted their spirits sin the
fatigues of Provisional Com-
mittees on Bubble Railways,
were said to be seeking repose
on-the-Continent. One-is
= reported to have taken a house
at Brussels; another to have
fled to Malta; whilea third is
alleged to be contemplatinga
protracted sojourn in some
palazzo of Italy. We should

pelled to own that we heard.

REMONSTRANCES FROM THE SHADES.
In the last number, 0 Punchlades 1 which Momus brought us of thy
pleasant scroll, there is that which I, for my part, thy hitherto great
admirer, hugely disapprove; and of my disapproval thereof, hasten to
make thee aware, infºrming thee likewise that both I myself on the one
hand, and on the other many highly respectable Shades of Heroes besides,
have determined, if the like occur again, to cease taking thee in, and in
thy stead to subscribe to the wise and facetious work conducted by the
god-like woman, HARRIs, which work we are informed will prove delec-
table reading for Shades, as being excessively shady, and which, though
having not the ghost of an argument, may soon become the standard
argument of the ghosts. Beware, therefore, O PunchiADEs how hence-
forth thou comparest a hero, and a man of mettle, whose dodges, however
artful, were generally devoted to such ends as his reminiscent eidolon
can now, smoke over without a blush, to—a Buckingham ; for such,

Charity over the Water.
The French Government has kindly consented to allow “A Repuge
Fon DiRectors” to be erected at Boulogne. This large and daily
increasing class are likely at last to have their wants properly attended
to. Several subscriptions have already been made, and the poor alder-
men will shortly have a place where they can rest their cervine heads
with safety. A charitable gentleman has sent a large sum of money,
that each alderman may have a basin of real turtle, at least once a-year.
The day selected is one fraught with civic recollections—the ninth of
November.
Punch's POLITICAL DICTIONARY.
cclesiastical CoMMtssion ERs. A
N body appointed to look into the
ºf Hi-revenues and duties of the Clergy.
# They have recommended a better
fº distribution of the loaves and fishes,
and have made the extraordinary
- discovery that the revenue of half
Tº the bishoprics did not pay their
| expenses, the income being posi-
_tively below-the-outlay incurred.
Perhaps, however, the ideas of the
Ecclesiastical Commissioners were
rather-extravagant, and their own
motorious-bankruptcy may be thus
accounted for.
Education. From educo, to lead
out. The bringing-forth of the
innate-faculties. The State does
not trouble itself much with edu-
cation in this country, but the most
usualischools for ºthae youngº and
destitute are the prisons; where Education of a certain kind is easily
imparted. It quickens the apprehension; for it frequently leads to
the apprehension of the scholariupou some very serious charge. It
moreover sharpens the wits, which are all that they whb-come under
thbiliſtience of prison education generally have to live upon.
EEEctron. Literally, the exercise of a free choice, but practi-
cally, at least-in many casess—the forced confirmation of the choice
of another.
ELEction CoMºrrtrees. Tribunals for deciding on the legality
of elections, but as the decisionnusualiy depends-on-the politics of the
majority of the members, the dabours offthe Committee might well
be spared by settling the matter at their first meeting. The affair
could be arranged with arithmetical precision according to the rule
of three, in the following fashion. As the politics of the majority
are to the candidates, so will be the decision.
ELEcton. A free voter. An elector is, however, in some cases,
one who elects either to support his landlord's nominee, or to take
the consequence.
EMANcipation. An admirable word in the mouths of politicians,
some of whom, however, consider it applicable only to the blacks, in
whose behalf the professions of a love for freedom are often very
highly coloured. It has been wisely and yet quaintly said by one of
the primitive wags, “that he who talks most loudly of emancipation
for the nigger would bestow freedom on his own countrymen with a
niggard hand.”
EMBARGo.—An arrest laid on a ship to prevent its quitting a port.
Such as the order of the Load MAYor, that the Watermen's steam-
ers shall not start from Blackfriars Pier. An embargo may also
be laid on ships to cause them to defend their native land, as in the
case of the levy made upon the coal barges and dredgers who were
compelled, by a kind of embargo, to join the civic fleet.
EMIGRATIon may be defined the act of leaving one's native coun-
try to settle in another. When the act is accompanied by that of
leaving one's native creditors without having settled in one's own
country, the probability that one will go and settle in another coun-
try is exceedingly remote—sometimes, indeed, more remote than the
place to which the emigrant betakes himself. The object of an
emigrant is usually to obtain land abroad, but he has sometimes very
good grounds at home for disappearing. Occasionally he goes into the
bush, and clears away the wood, an operation for which, by cutting
his stick, he has already prepared himself. It is said that an emi-
grant is one who finds that he is not in demand at home, but this is a
mistaire, for some emigrants, particularly those to Boulogne, and other
foreign watering places, have been in verygreat demand at home before
emigration. Some have objected to emigration on the score that
every person who quits a kingdom, takes from it, in his own person,
so much capital and labour. This is very true in some cases, for if
I lend my friend five hundred pounds, and he suddenly emigrates, it
is probable he will take that amount of cºpital with him, and will
cause also a fearful waste of labour by giving me the useless trouble
of looking after him. This is sound political economy, which we
have acquired by submitting ourselves to a course of good grinding
in Mill for the last fortnight.

The Militia-Man, having cured his cold with Rum-and-Water, resolves not to go Home “Till roay-light
does appear."
CONSIDERABLE curiosity has been excited to know the name of
Punch's One Militia Man; but the gallant fellow has resolved on ob-
serving a strict incognito. There is a rumour that he has already won his
laurels on the field of glory, but we can state that the embryo hero is not
the proprietor of any laurels but the two (in pots) beside the gate of his
garden. These he did not win, but paid for like a man, at an adjacent
nursery.
Among the recent military manoeuvres of the Militia Man has been
that of taking up a position in the trenches, for which the great open
ditch running along Brook Green affords the finest facility. This ditch
is further adapted for a military position by the fact, that the vapour
arising from it renders it generally unapproachable. The Militia Man
delights in exposing himself to it, that he may become accustomed to the
atmosphere of any unhealthy climate to which his country may hereafter
call him.
There is a rumour that the local police of Hammersmith are infected
with the military enthusiasm of the One Militia Man, and the inspector—
an old soldier, who has exchanged the bayonet for the baton—has declared
himself ready to bring up his little local cohort to death or glory by the

eight o'clock 'bus, whenever the emergencies of the nation require the
sacrifice.
The ardour for arms is extending to some of the tradesmen in the
vicinity, and it is expected that Hammersmith will become a camp, if the
same spirit continues to display itself. When it is remembered that the town
commands the river on one side, the road to the capital on the other, and
is skirted by the Bush in which the Shepherds tend their flocks, as well
as the celebrated Scrubs, rich in the Wormwood so useful for chemical
purposes; when all this is remembered, it must be admitted that Ham-
mersmith is the CHUBB's Patent Safety of the metropolis. . It is gratifying
to know that this lock will not be easily picked by the enemy.
We have heard a rumour that the glazed horse-guard looking hats of
the disbanded corps of Hammersmith Sapier Pompiers, or fire brigade,
which dissolved itself and its funds some time ago in beer, are about to
be purchased for the volunteers who are likely to be embodied in this
gallant suburb. Hammersmith will, we suspect, be the Hexham or
Hastings of some future history; Brook Green will become a secon
Waterloo, and the turnpike-gate the Torres Vedras of the twentieth
century.
tºº.º. -- NICHOLAS “ AT HOME.”
His Imperial Majesty has been in a high passion. Like many small
domestic tyrants, he had a face of honey, and words sweet as sugar-plums,
when abroad ; but, once come home again, he looks the old fury, and
raps out his customary bad language. To be sure he gave the Order of
Saint Lollypop—or some order worthy of the Calendar—to his son for
his good behaviour: (whether the youth had chained and starved and
scourged a convent of nuns, after the example of gracious papa, has not
yet transpired.) Next, however, his Imperial Cruelty took to task all his
ministers; snubbing some, breaking some, and hinting at Siberia to
others. And what for They had brought disrepute upon his Govern-
ment; they had been tyrannous and sanguinary, and had caused him to
be reprimanded by the Pope 1 And all this is to throw dust—devil's dust,
surely, if any dust soever may deserve the name – in the eyes of his
Holiness. It is needful that there should be a sacrifice of somebody, to
conciliate the Vatican, and so Nicholas offers up a minister or a governor.
Does the reader recollect the sacrifice required to stay the plague among
the beasts? It was not the lion, or the tiger, or the wolf, for its carni-
vorous sins; not the men-eaters and flock-destroyers; but the poor ass,
that confessed, in a moment of temptation, to have eaten a cabbage.
And some such victim does Nicholas offer to his Holiness 1
LEGAL BIOGRAPHIES.
The success that has attended the publication of Twiss’s “Life of Lond

be a great addition to the legal literature of the country. The struggles
of the great are often by no means so interesting as the energetic effort.
of the little, and the career of the Clerk is very frequently a series of
heart-burnings, which terminate in his getting the sack—which is, after
all, the summum bonum of the would-be Chancellor. The life of a Tho"
son is not likely to be less interesting than the biography of a Bacon, ſº
it has been well said by the philosopher, (ourselves, of course,) that it is
easier to learn how to act in a high position than to behave with propriety
in an humble station.

THE LONDON GENEALOGICAL SOCIETY.
“Aux armes, citoyens; aur armes? "
E are about to confer a tremendous
favour - on this new Society,
namely, to make them known,
and charge nothing for the ad-
vertisement. Not that we expect
their gratitude in return ; cer-
tainly not. We have suffered
—yes, suffered is the word—too
much, to hope for it. “For in-
stance, did we not make Silk
BuckinghAM known —Did we
not, on the wings of Punch, ad-
vertise the peculiar advantages
of the Foreign Destitute, even
as far as Otaheite, that in case
any of the aristocracy-should
come over, they might find their
way to Hanover Square : And
what was our reward . One tear
stands in each of our eyes when
we think of it. But “we won’t
weep.” No : we will continue to
do good for good's sake; we will still go on, conferring benefits upon
mankind, and only pity them, when they throw at us dirt and wicked
words in return. And with this preface return we to consider the
many nascent merits of the LoNDon GENEALogical Society.
A prospectus, put forth by this benevolent body, has been sent us. In
it all the world—and ourselves, of course, as minima pars—are invited
to pay one guinea “for the entry of their arms and pedigree :” that is,
one guinea “plain ;” it being more than insinuated that the charge will
be higher, if “coloured ; ” that is, if “fully illuminated.” The
Society—like many other societies—intend to go round the kingdom,
asking for arms. This “Visitation” began in the cities of London and
Westminster on the 2nd inst., and the Society say—
“This Visitation appears the more desirable when it is considered that there are so
many. Foreign Princes, Nobles, and highly distinguished Families (Euglish and Foreign)
at this time resident in Middlesex, of whose Genealogies we have no Record, although
they possess proofs of their great Antiquity; while there are others—and some who have
gained Rank, or elevated position in Society—of the early part of whose Pedigrees no
information has been gathered.”
These latter unfortunates have our deepest sympathies. Imagine the
“Visitation” knocking at the door of a man “who has gained rank,” and
asking, in almost the words of dear Tom Hood—
“Who was your father?
Who was your mother?
Have you a sister?
Have you a brother?”
And then consider the confusion of the person so addressed Perhaps
his utter inability to answer the first two queries, though, it may be,
painfully sensitive—from certain accidents—to the last two In his
despair he calls for his teaspoons, and shows the “Visitation” a some-
thing engraven on them between a griffin and a rocking-horse, or a snake
eating its own tail. From this hybrid griffin, this suicidal snake, depend
upon it, the “Visitation” will make a very pretty illumination; bringing
down the griffin from Cathay, the land of griffins, and the snake from the
favourite curl—the heart-breaker—in MEDUSA's head We have no
doubt that the “Visitation” will guarantee antiquity, even if, like certain
Roman medallists, they make it.
“Though it is not doubted that the Nobility, Gentry, and Clergy (few of whose Pedi-
grees are perfect in the MATERNAL Lines) would most readily assist the proposed object,
the Society has determined not to call upon them to join in Expense, but will charge the
fee of ºne Guinea only, for the Entry of their arms and Pedigree (unless they wish it
fºlly illuminated) in the Visitation Records. It is desirable the Nobility and Gentry in
all parts of the kingdom should become Members, paying two Guineas Annually; and
as the early Members will have peculiar privileges, their names should be forwarded and
enrºlled, as early as possible—whereby they would secure the desirable advantage of
having their Pedigrees traced to a greater extent in the several Lines.”
For instance, an “early member” may have his pedigree traced back
to a very distinguished hod-man, employed at the building of Babel;
whereas a later subscriber may have the founder of his family discovered
no later than in the person of some cordwainer to Japhet. This differ-
ence ought to weigh with all who think to join the Society. Therefore,
again we cry, “Aux armes, citoyens ; aux armes.”
There is also a Genealogical Institution to be established, whereat
“ladies, noblemen, and gentlemen” may execute their own “heraldic
embellishments; such pursuits being now high objects of taste,” and all
blunders avoided;
“For it is notorious that the incorrect execution of Armorials, (the mistakes in the
Engravlug of Arms on Plate, Seals, Glass, &c., and other artistic embellishments) is a
source aſ daily annoyance to persons of distinction; for by such means errors in the
Family Bearings are to a great extent perpetuated.”
We can well believe it. We can feel how certain “persons of distinc-
tion” are apt to be misrepresented by what may pass for their heraldic
bearings. All sorts of monsters may creep into-the-Arms of a family,
perpetuating the annoyance. It is only by such accidents that we can
at all reconcile, many seeming anomalies. By the way, do the Society
bargain to make every bend sinister all right? Nothing, however, can be
more comprehensive than the plans of the Society, for it
“Will have the advantage of Corresponding Members in various parts of each County:
and such, likewise, are being appointed in every part of the globe where British Emi-
grants, Settlers, and Residents are to be ound ; so that the earliest and most exten-
sive modes of information will be insured.”
This is consoling. Let a man dwell either in a log-hut of North
America, or in the bush in New Zealand, it will henceforth be delightful
to him to know that some “corresponding member" from “32, Cockspur
Street, Pall Mall,” such being the Genealogical Office, may drop in upon
him, to have a chat about his family gules, and or, and argent / By
the way, the New Zealanders themselves might be appointed agents; all
their noblemen carrying their arms upon their bodies, and therefore
passionate lovers of the heraldic. -
From what the reader has already gone through, he will doubtless
acknowledge the astounding utility of this Society; nevertheless, it might,
we think, extend its sphere of usefulness. For instance, why should it not
propose to quarter armorial bearings with some new device, to illustrate
and perpetuate the doings of living nobility and gentry. A few of our
dukes, now, would form admirable experimental subjects. Might not the
Times in flames be brought into the coat of Richmond, and a curry bottle
quartered with the marshal's staff of Noafolk :
Let us, however, show our gratitude to the Society, whereof one
“E. WYRRELLE. M. WEBER'' is “Marshal and Principal”—gratitude
that we ourselves, in the comprehensive benevolence of the College, are
not forgotten; for Rule XVIII. states that—
“The society generally, shall have power to elect distinguished Literary Gentlemen as
Honorary Members, without any payments whatever, on the nomination thereof by
the Marshal.”
According to this rule, Punch-will of course be one of the earliest
members. "He therefore—that he may find himself properly illuminated
—begs that the Society will immediately emblazon all his bearings.
When this shall be done. Punch demands the same favour on the part of
Toby his dog. MR. WEBER, “Marshal and Principal,” is of course
at liberty to correct us; but we, Punch, believe that Toby originated
with the apocryphal dog of ToBIT, with possibly a cross from CERBERUs.
But of course, the “Marshal and Principal” will easily decide this.
However, it must be done; for if we do enter the Society, “our faithful
dog must bear us company.”

N consequence of the excitement occasioned in the
neighbourhood by the Battle of the Thames being
fought in the way of a general mêlée, it has been
arranged among some of the parties to settle the
dispute by a series of single coubats. The arrange-
ment, we believe, only waits for the Lord MAYon's
sanction ; and as that dignitary has formally joined
the war-party, it is very probable that he will at once
give his encouragement to any measure having a fight
or series of fights for its object.
We understand that the following propositions for
pitched battles will be among those submitted to the
approval and patronage of the Cockney potentate.
LITTLE Dick, the Bridegroom's pet, will be matched
against SAwNY BRowN, the Paul's Wharf dredger-boy;
StokeR Tugs, the Moonlight deaf'un, will undertake
to fight CITY PolicEMAN SNoBBINs, the Kitchen Romeo;
the Chairman of the Directors of the Watermen's
Steam Packet Company will fight the LoRD MAYon,
and allow him his mace against an ordinary hockey-stick ; WATER
BAIliff SMITH, the long, shore skull-cracker, will fight any three
passengers of any one of the Watermen's Navy, two up and the other
down, for forty minutes.
The above are only intended to make a beginning, and induce other
champions to fall into the arrangements. The parties will therefore
fight, pour encourager les autres, who are requested to enter their names
forthwith, at the Beadle's Box on the Blackfriar's pier, or with the Lond
MAYor, at the Mansion House.

HERE has been a grand Exhi-

to givea classical aspect
to the plates and dishes
of an every-day dinner-

at the bottom of the vessell We are delighted to find a disposition to apply
the higher departments of art to the ordinary tea-tray.
We can imagine what WILKIE might have done with a set of japanned
waiters. What a splendid effect would be produced by the removal of
every plate or glass that was being landed round, revealing at every
movement of the crockery some new bit of colouring, some unexpected
burst of nature, which might previously have been concealed under cakes,
wine, or sandwiches 1
Among the choicest objects in the Exposition is a
pair of library bellows, which some artist in the an-
tique has poured his whole soul into ; so that the
bellows may be said to breathe with the purest spirit
of classicality. Considerable taste has been expended
on the improvement of that social article commonly
known as a brass footman; though the brass for
which all footmen are notorious is by no means of
a pliable character. A wreath of laurel is thrown
tastefully round the top of the footman, showing what
may be done with the humblest article, by a happy
combination of skill and industry.
Much taste and fancy have been displayed in the
construction of an easy chair made of wrought iron;
the ease of the chair consisting of the seat being a
good deal like a gridiron, while the back of it is thrown
up into such relief as can be afforded by clusters of
prickly flowers, made of the hardest metal, to lean
against.
Some stir at the Exposition was made by a poker of
polished steel, modelled after the 'original rod of iron
with which the tyrant Caligula is supposed to have ruled his subjects.
An umbrella-stand, representing DANAE
descending in a golden shower would have
been a good idea, if there had been any
room for the umbrellas; but it unfortu-
nately happens that the article is utterly
useless. Its ornamental aspect may
perhaps in some degree compensate for
the deficiency. Such are the principal
features of the Exhibition; the last fea-
ture we shall mention being a beautiful
and classical Roman nose to a pair of
drawing-room bellows.

SHALL THE QUEEN OF SPAIN HAVE A HUSBAND:
We are really tired of this question, and wish it were at once fairly
settled by the ring and the priest. SENom NARVAEz—that great Spanish
fly—lately declared that Her Majesty herself had no notion of iage.
Like the fair Juliet, “’twas an honour she dreamt not of.” The last
accounts, however, from Madrid, assure us that the Queen has now
serious thoughts of wedlock. Several patterns of husbands have been
submitted to her; in the like way that little girls are shown a variety of
dresses, mamma all the while being determined upon the only one the
dear child shall wear. Thus the Count TRAPANI seems to stand the
fairest chance of obtaining the Queen's hand, and with it the contempt
and hatred of the chivalrous Spanish nation. NARVAEz, however, has
declared—and we must believe him—that the Queen shall not be coaxed
into holy wedlock; that she shall marry, if it shall so please her, “an
African Prince;” yes, a blackamoor, with a crown of parrots' feathers,
and a robe of tiger's skin. This is very generous, indeed, of SRNos.
NARVAEz; but if the Queen may exercise her taste upon African Princes,
it would be only fair that she should be permitted to see certain samples
of them. After all, it is a fine, ennobling thing for humanity, that the
security and happiness of millions of mankind should be brought into
question by the marriage of a little girl with some very little prince .
A WASHINGTON WAR-CRY.
Raise high the shout of warfare 1
E’en now proud England cowers,
As Washington upon her head
Scorn and saliva showers.
Soon the great Columbian Eagle
O'er ocean wide shall soar;
With cock-tail and mint-julep,
He's already half seas o'er. .
Arise, arouse for Oregon —
Prate not to us of Right !
Sons of the Pilgrim fathers,
We take our stand on Might.
The favoured race of Freedom
Are not the men to flinch
From the spread of sacred slavery
And the blessed law of Lynch.
'Tis not in down-trod England
As in this happy land,
Where each man wops his nigger,
And none may hold his hand;
Not as in out-worn Europe,
Opinion here is free,
And no man dares to contradict
The sovereign mob's decree
Democracy wants elbow-room
To put its branches forth ;
Our South is cramp'd by Mexico,
By Canada our North.
Spread, pioneers of Progress,
Your sway from shore to shore,
With unanswerable arguments
And mounted rifle-corps.
With bowie knives and bullets
We'll enforce the rights of man;
In the holy name of Justice
We’ll take whate'er we can.
The South shall send her slave-holders,
To bid the world be free l
Pennsylvania her defaulters,
To teach it honesty I
Timely Liberality.
It is well known that Messrs. Jones, Lloyd, & Co. recently made a
very handsome present, in money, to their clerks. Other bankers, we
perceive, have followed the example (with a difference). presenting to
their employed, in lieu of filthy lucre, religious tracts. We understand
that other firms are about to give to their clerks a significant volume
entitled, “How to live on a hundred a-year.”

A MINISTERIAL QUARTET.
The following little classical quartet was sung just before the tempo-
rary dissolution of the Ministry. Lord STANLEY, who took a part in the
quartet, destroyed the harmony and ultimately put an end to the concert.
He would not agree to subdue his voice sufficiently, or, in other words, to
sing small, and he was consequently kept out of the arrangements when
the Ministerial Sons of Harmony met together again for the purpose of
practising the new tunes, and adopting the airs and variations of the
Premier. But we are losing sight of the quartet, which ran as follows:—
Loºp Stanley, (andantino).
Corn must go up, up, up.
SIR. R. PeFL, (con expressione).
Corn must come down, down, down.
The Duke of WELLINGTox, (constrepito).
Here we go backwards and forwards.
SIR. R. Psel, (vivace allegro).
I shall go round, round, round.
After giving this line with unusual emphasis, SIR. R. PEEL, looking
round him, exclaimed, with considerable meaning, “Now then, chorus,
Gentlemen, if you please; let me hear you all sing out plainly afterme,
“I shall go round, round, round.”
Loan STANLEY positively refused to do so, observing, that it was quite
out of his compass, and he had not sufficient flexibility to get over the
difficulty.
A long discussion ensued, which ended in the entire destruction of the
concert, and the total sacrifice of harmony. After a little rehearsal, how-
ever, the difficulty has been got over by nearly all the principals, who
now sing
“Here we go round, round, round,”
with as much energy as the Premier himself could desire to throwinto it.

Theme is no doubt that Protection originated in amist, which, however,
was not a fine mist, but an intellectual fog of singular density. Its ves-
tiges are apparent in the imperfect state of Agriculture, which no doubt
would have been improved by competition; also inacrippled and shackled
condition of Commerce. Pauperism and the Union workhouse are
vestiges of Protection, which are also observable in the ducal skull; with
whose thickness it has an evident connection.

T
WHAT TO. Do WITH THE DUKES. º.
“We should very much like to know of what use those Dukes are "
This is a question which manythinking persons have lately put to us.
In reply, we have reminded them of the services of the Iron Duke; but
that is, they have said, is not one of those Dukes, whom, in contra-
distinction, they have styled Wooden Dukes. Then we have pointed out
to them the fitness of the Dukes in question for the º: of Earl
Marshal, and of Knight of the Garter or of the Thistle—the last named
order especially:"The answer we have received has been—Pooh, pooh!
We have adduced the value of such Dukes as patrons of the Turf, and
thus maintainers of the equestrian order of nobility; which argument has
been met by the tion of-Stuff and nonsense 1 and the remark,
that it was the asi º ºf the equestrian order that was maintained
by those noblemen." º - ºul
We have instanced *qualifications for the post of Grand Falconer;
but were told that they were qualified for nothing grand, except for the
situation of Grand Gamekeeper, if such an ºffice existed. In vain have
we insisted on the importance of the ducal name in prospectuses, and of
the privilege possessed by Duhes ºf making Duchesses, and thus supplying
Lady Patronesses to fancy-balls and so forth. With as little success
have we enlarged upon . encºuragement which they afford to that truly
national institution, the Italian Opera. The reply to our plea has been,
Fiddle-de-dee lºor, Rubbishi-We will not, however, give up our Dukes
as good-for-nothing; because we are firmly persuaded that they are good
for something; tıd what that is, we believe we have found out.
We have h trºduced as haughty aristocrats—scorners of
trade and comm ºpursuits- On the contrary, we are satisfied, from
their anxiety about their rents and profits, that their bent is purely mer-
cantile, and that their main object is the main chance; so that their sym-
pathies are peculiarly civic. Nay, we are sure that they would make the
first citizens of the first city in the world. From a comparison of the
wisdom of the Dukes with that of Solomon on the one hand, and that of
Lord Mayors in general on the other, as evinced in their respective apho-
risms and argumentations, we are convinced that the ducal and alderma-
nic are precisely the same order of minds; and hence that their Graces
are just the very persons to grace the throne of the Mansion House.
Venice had Doges; why should not London have Dukes? We may say,
with propriety, of the Wooden Dukes, that they are completely cut out
for Lord Mayors. They would commit prisoners with the assistance of
the City Clerk, and themselves without any assistance at all, as cleverly
as any one of their predecessors, from Whittington downto his present
Civic Majesty.
The chief business of Dukes at present, particularly of Royal Dukes, is
to preside at dinners; which is also the principal duty of a Lord Mayor.
Born to consume the fruits of the earth, and having hitherto had little
else to do, they would vie, as trenchermen no less than magistrates, with
any member of the Corporation. Their antiquated predilections would
enable them to fraternise admirably with Gog and Magog, and with the
Man in Armour.
By the union of the Dukedom with the Mayoralty, the splendour of the
latter office would be much augmented; and the Duke, on his inaugura-
tion, on taking the water, might, in imitation of the Venetian Doges,
marry the River Thames.
Let the Lord Mayor, then, in future, be chosen from among the Dukes
instead of from among the Aldermen, and thus will many heartburnings
be removed. Many of them are already free of the City Companies, and
more might become connected with them; as it is, several game-pre-
serving Dukes are poulterers; and why should they not become fish-
mongers, or mongers of any other description—not to mention borough-
mongers as well?
A CARD.
M. Julliºn begs to announce that, encouraged by the unrivalled
success and distinguished patronage which have attended the production
of his “Cricket Polka,” and other compositions of a similar kind, he will, in
his ensuing season, introduce to the public notice two new pieces, namely,
“The Household Walse,” and “The Menagerie Quadrilles.” The former
will include faithful imitations of all the peculiar sounds incidental to the
course of household occupations during the day, from the cleaning of the
boots and knives in the morning, to the fastening of the hall-door at
night. M. Julliex conceives that this valse will be particularly adapted
to the domestic and home-loving habits of the British nation.
The Menagerie Quadrilles (dedicated by permission to the Zoological
Society) will comprise combinations of the cries of the principal animals
of note in the Zoological Gardens.
The very flattering reception which has been given to M. Juliº's
musical productions has emboldened him to bring forward these novelties,
in doing which he believes he ventures upon ground which former
masters have hesitated to tread.

T EI E FLIG EIT OF
T EII: A LID. E. R. M. E.N.
THE LANDLORD’s “HEAVEN.”
AT an Anti-Corn-Law meeting held at Atherstone, one REv. T.C.
PELL, vicar of Sheepy, was very tremendous against the League.
“I hope to God (said his Reverence) these over-grown manufacturers will never
over-ride the landed interest: as sure as they obtain possession of the land, you'll
become a parcel of impoverished creatures directly, with threadbare coats, and lank of
countenances.” -
Of course, he spoke to those fabulous animals of our time, the
“happy peasantry;” none of them already impoverished; none with
thin, white faces; but all with an odd yellow-boy or two in an old
stocking or tea-pot at home; and all looking sleek and rosy, the
painted pictures of rustic contentment 1 The Vicar next—is he from
Cam or Isis —in academical language, denounced “PEEL's speech
and his plan as all fudge,” and closed with this remarkable perora-
tion —“He’d rather like the chance of going to heaven with the
landed interest than go with, the manufacturer.” We are always
prone to bow to a clergyman when he talks of the peculiar privileges
of heaven: he is supposed, ex officio, to know them. Henceforth, it
would appear that MEssRs. Cobden and BRIGHT, and all the lost
ones of wicked Manchester and forlorn Leeds, have but little chance
of future bliss, when compared with the abounding hopes of a DUKE
of Richmond or a DUKE of Noarolk. Their earthly coronets are
but the shadows cast from the immortal crowns, already prepared
for them 1 Now, the wicked manufacturers—living as they do
beneath a canopy of smoke—seeing smoke, smoke, smoke, nothing
but smoke —vomited from their tall, melancholy chimneys, may
see and feel in the stifling vapours, rolling upward from blazing fires,
a terrible type of their future doom. Judging from the expressed
opinions of the Vicar of Sheepy, we have no doubt that he has the
highest and the profoundest veneration for ADAM ; not merely
because he was the prime author of the human race; not that he
was the First Man ; but the Garden of Eden being awarded to him,
that he was the First Landowner Again, too, the excellent vicar
—the reverend laquais de place to heaven—may, possibly, not so much
mourn the Fall of our First Parent, for the Fall itself; but for the
melancholy fact that it made ADAM, from that moment, in some way
dependent on some manufacturer. There is little doubt—according
to the Vicar of Sheepy—that when SATAN tempted our first pa-
rents, he had in his wicked and far-seeing eye the chimneys of
Manchester.
After all, is it not remarkably pleasant—very improving, too-to
have a Reverend Vicar carving up our after-life as though it were a
tythe-pig : giving the tit-bits to his friends, and leaving the poorer
parts for the servants : . . . . . .

MAKING THE MOST OF A VICTORY.
THERE has been a grand Review at Paris before the Ambassador of
the EMPERoR of MoRocco, on which occasion the French, with national
gallantry, fought their battle of...Isly over again. The old Umbrella was
brought out from the Invalides to do honour to the victory, and nothing
was wanting to perfect the illusion of the scene but the presente ºf
Abd-el-Kapen. Manshal Bugeaud had sent word that the Emir would
be sure to attend, and accordingly the battle was kept waiting several
hours expressly for him; but at last an apology was made by the Duke
of NEMouns, that a previous engagement unavoidably detained ABD-Blº
KADER in Algiers. His part, however, was undertaken at the shortest
notice by an actor of the Cirque Olympique, who having acted it a hun.
dred times before, went through it with the greatest sang froid, and
came off, as usual, with flying colours. ,

M RS. B I B2S BABY.
CHAPTER IV.
EALLY MR. Bin was a good, work-
ing-day husband. We do not mean
to back him against any romantic
sample of a spouse; such hus-
bands being too often worked in silk
or painted on satin, like rosebuds
and canary-birds, solely for the
amusement of young spinsters. He
loved his wife in a plain, straight-
forward fashion ; and as he was
never lavishly tender to her before
company, there is the greater reason
to believe that he was neither savage
nor silent to her when alone. For
some married folks will keep their
love like their jewellery, for the eyes
of the world; thinking it too fine
and too precious to wear every day
at their fire-side. MR. BIB, too, was
reasonably proud of his child. His
wife—dear soul ſ—had her private
opinion that, old as the world was,
and multitudinous as were its chil-
dren, there had never — until the
advent of her Babe—been a proper
child born. They had been very
well; they had served to keep up
the stock of mankind, but they were
not like Baby BIB. And who shall
blame her for so sweet a prejudice Natural to her as her mother's
milk?
In our last chapter we left Baby in a tremendous passion; and
the roast-pig, lying heavily on its stomach, it would not be com-
forted. Mas. DAFFY was somewhat ruffled by the perverseness of
the child—whose ill-humour was, in truth, a reflection on her
judgment; a condemnation of her election of pig as the one thing
needful for its peace of mind and body. She was, we say it, a little
angry with Baby; but her greater cause of concern was, lest
Grandmother BIB should bounce into the family circle, and—for she
could not help it—enjoy the triumph conveyed by Baby's ill-humour.
MRs. DAFFY dreaded that icy smile, those coldly gleaming eyes,
and that prophecy—uttered with a sort of relish—of Baby's certain
decease, if certain people would have their way with it. And still
Baby screamed ; and with an energy that gave high promise of its
future strength of character.
“I do think, SARAH,” said MRs. DAFFY, “that a little aniseed
would quiet it. Just a drop.”
MR. BIB entered the room as his mother-in-law delivered the
above opinion. He stopt short; looked, for him, a little sternly in
that" gentlewoman's face, and with a kind of menace, wagging his
forefinger, said—“Mas. DAFFY, you will, I trust, allow me to have
some property—just a little—in my own child.”
“Why, of course, MR. BIB, it’s your own—nobody that looked at
it could doubt that,” said MRs. DAFFY. “To be sure it’s your own,
and though 'tis my daughter's child—which is something more—still
I must say this, the blessed infant does you credit.”
“Being then, my own property,’” said BIB, “it is my intention,
Mns. DAFFY, not to have it tampered with.”
“Tampered 1 La 1" cried MRs. DAFFY. “Who’d think of doing
it? Bless its little heart 1 I'm sure I could eat it.” So spoke a
grandmother's love.
“I’ll not dispute that,” said BIB. It may speak a great deal for
your affection, though I can't very well allow that it says much for
your taste.”
Mas. DAFFY looked at her son-in-law with a perplexed face.
Could the man be such a simpleton as to believe that she could really
digest her grandson But, then, in the matter of babies, men were
such fools. “Why,” she at length observed, “you didn't think I
meant what I said But you’re all alike—you men do so like to
take women up. It's just the same with her father. You're all
alike.” and MRs. DAFFY essayed a slight laugh, though not from her
heart; for there was something odd and strange—almost rude in the
manner of her son-in-law. Here Baby took new breath, and began
to scream afresh. “SARAH,” said Mas. DAfry, very earnestly, “it
must have some aniseed.”
“Not a drop," said BIB ; and he knitted his brow, and looked
authority.
“Well, MR. BIB, if you like to kill your child,” and Mas.Darry
spoke as though she sarcastically allowed BIB's perfectright to such
enjoyment—“if you like to kill your child.”
“I neither intend to kill it myself,” said BIB, “nor tolet anybody
else poison it.”
Different thoughts started into Mas. Daffy's brain, and starting
from different points and jostling one another, leaving the owner in
an interesting state of irresolution. The first tremendous thought
was to ask MR. BIB what he really meant. Thought the second was
to rise from the chair, and majestically depositing Baby in the arms
of its mother, to leave the house and never again to enter it.
Thought the third was merely to echo BIB, and cry “poison 1”
Another thought was to take out a pocket-handkerchief. At length
Mas. DAFFY made her election. She chose thought three, and did
say “Poison 1”
“Exactly so: poison,” said Bip. “I heard you speak of giving
the Baby aniseed.”
“To be sure : why not? I gave it to all of mine,” replied Mas.
DAFFY very courageously.
“Well, I daresay their brains have proved none the stronger for
that,” said the coarse, uncivil BIB ; his sweet little wife rather
opening her eyes at the strange ill-manners of Edward.
“I am sure, MR. BIB, I don't know what you mean,” said MRs.
DAFFY, in tones that declared she too acutely felt the insult of every
syllable. “I believe I’ve had nine children.” MRs. DAFFY was
suddenly touched with such humility that she would not, on her own
responsibility, vouch for the number. “I believe I’ve had nine ;
and a finer family never—but that's nothing to do with it. Nothing.
I'm sure, too, their brains—not that I wish to say anything; I’ve
no right, I know—still their brains have been quite as good as other
people's. The DAFFY's were never fools, MR. BIB.” And here the
good, insulted soul did take out her handkerchief. In fact, if BIB
had had any knowledge of human nature, he must have known that
that white flag of female distress would be duly hoisted at the
rounding of the proper period.
“There’s no necessity for crying,” said BIB ; for he saw his wife
begin to wink her pretty eyelids, and try to swallow the tears that
were coming up ; tears at times being very catching. “Can't I say
that I won't have the child drugged and poisoned without having
such a high-service of water played upon me?”
“Now, don't be unfeeling, Edward,” said meek MRs. BIB. “I’m
sure dear mother means for the best.”
“To be sure she does. I know that,” said BIB ; “I don’t com-
plain of her evil intentions, good soul, but only of her ignorance l’”
Ignorance was the word. And the hearth-rug was not suddenly
rolled up like a scroll, and the flooring did not open at the feet of
MRs. DAFFY. After a moment's pause of consternation she smiled
a smile, intended to cut like a razor, and said, with a slight hysteric
chuckle, “Ignorance 1 Nine children—only nine ! I never knew
that aniseed could hurt a baby yet ! But you’ve such strange ways,
MR. BIB : you’d bring up a Baby like a little heathen savage, and
not like a Christian child. If it’s a cripple, it isn't my fault, for it
isn't half-rolled up enough. I don’t know who'd be your Baby,
I'm sure, to have such new-fangled tricks played with it. I never
heard any other man talk about babies as you do. For my
part—not that I’ve any right to speak—I don’t see what fathers
have to do with children at all till they’re called upon to pay the
school-bills. DAFFY never meddled. I took care of that. But
some people are so clever, talking about a natural way of bringing
up children, just as if precious children were to be brought up like
kittens. I should like to know what sense was given to us for, if
not to invent aniseed, and peppermint, and such things, to comfort
their dear little hearts. It’s all very well with black savages, that
don't know what “ GoDFREY's' is—that never heard of the “Soothing
Syrup" no more than of KING SolomoN, it's very well for them
to trust to what they call nature, but I should hope that Chris-
tians know a little better.”
B1.B would not continue the fight. Taking his hat he emphatically
said, “Mind—I insist—not a drop of your comfort as you call it, to
stupefy the child—not a drop.” With this injunction he quitted
the room. --- -
MRs. DAFFY suffered due time to elapse for the master of the
house to get a safe distance from it, when—tugging at the bell-rope
—she said, “SARAH, my dear, we’ll now send BEcky for the aniseed.”

AN OLIVER FOR A ROWLAND.
THE great genius of Macassar has been outdone by an unknown author,
who has sent forth a powerful piece of writing on the subject of
“THE NEAPOLITAN, CREAM,
“For BEAUTIFYING AND Nourishing THE HAIR, Etc.”
It is pleasant, indeed, when history may be studied in the simple, ad-
vertisements of a pomade for the hair, and we think the proprietor of the
Neapolitan Cream here shows his superiority to the Monarch of Macassar.
The former, in his handbill, gives us an insight into some of the remark-
able events connected with the temporary establishment of Napoleon and
his satellites on the various thrones of Europe. We are informed, for
instance, that
“This extraordinary preparation for the Hair, as used by JoAchim Murat, (the late
KING of NAPLss,) is prepared faithfully from the Receipt originally in the possession
of His late Majesty's first Valet-de-Chambre, and who was induced at a very great
price to part with the Original Receipt to GIAN CARRAR1, now Sole Proprietor.”
We here find that MURAT used the cream, and that the Receipt was
fondly cherished by the king's first valet-de-chambre, from whom it was torn
—heartstrings and all, no doubt—by its present proprietor. There is
also a most beautiful and affecting turn from the pomp of courts and the
downfall of kings to the quiet associations of the nursery. What can be
more charming than the following home thrust at our home affections !
“For the Nursery it is invaluable, and no Parent having any regard for the future
personal appearance of her offspring, will neglect to avail themselves of the use of this
truly valuable discovery.”
What a delightful yet severe reproach is conveyed in these lines against
the occasional neglect shown by a parent of “the future personal appear-
ance of her offspring!” No wonder that the writer gets hurried from the
singular to the plural by the intensity of his emotions, and after talking
of “her,” suldenly charges upon “themselves” the sin of neglecting
“this truly valuable discovery.” We are sure that after the specimen
we have given of his powers, our readers will inquire curiously where the
littérateur of the Neapolitan Cream has hitherto hid himself?

Foreign trade and markets courting.
Safe from all but want of grist;
Louder roars the people's clamour,
Think what fear our minds enthrals;
Harder yet and yet they hammer;
Hark! again the Landlord calls 1
Prepare anew to brave the wind, boys;
Stop the League's terrific force ;
Let the Tariff pass—don't mind, boys,
Though the matter should be worse;
The sliding-scale make safe and fast, lads;
Bread, we’ll hope, will still be dear;
Nail yºur colours to the mast, lads,
Up and at them, boys; dº ye hear? |
Now the British Lion's roaring,
PEEL and PEEL contending clash,
Former friends, behold ! he's flooring, -
Lo! our cause he means to smash :
One vast League is all around us,
From our ranks deserters fly ,
Facts and figures stern confound us—
Hark!—what means that gen'ral cry?
|

“The harvest's fail'd l’ cries every tongue out,
“Through the year our wheat won't last;
Free Trade's banner's proudly hung out,
And Repeal must now be past.”
Quick 1 or else we go to pieces—
Fight, my hearties stout and bold,
Rally round your rents and leases-
Vain the struggle ! we are sold !!
While in our ears huzzas are ringing,
For the good old times we mourn ;
Which back, alas ! there is no bringing,
Of which, alas ! there’s no return.
Competition's gaining on us;
Bread will fall and rent be low ;
Common sense come down upon us!
For only that can save us now.
Cultivate your barren land, boys,
Let your wastes with grain be sown;
To the plough come every hand, boys,
Eh 1 by Jovel our panic's flown
More mouths to feed, more corn to feed them,
Has broken our tremendous fall:
Protective laws no more we need them ;
We're saved, we’re saved, lads, after all !
Now once more on joys we're thinking,
Since we’ve saved our precious wealth ;
Come, the glass, boys 1 let's be drinking
To the British Lab’rer's health !
Fill it up, around we'll wheel it,
Three times three, with Kentish fire:
Where's our ruin now—who feels it?
None, not e'en the country "Squire.

SIR. ROBERT'S WELVETEEN.
T will, doubtless, be remembered by our readers that,
on a certain occasion, not a very long time ago, Sin
Robert PEEL was presented with a handsome
piece of velveteen—of a new and peculiar kind of
fabric, the offering of certain manufacturers. The
velveteen was graciously accepted. Sin Robert
would have it made into a garment of honour.
The velveteen was about to be despatched to the
family tailor, when Sun Robert's eye, or some
other eye interested in the consistency of the Minis-
ter, discovered in the elaborate pattern of the
manufacture certain ears of wheat, surrounded by
letters, very minute, making up the words—“Free
Corn 1" Since the classic and fatal gift of the shirt
of NEssus—since proved to be of Caledonian fabric
—there had been no such wickedness smuggled
in what appeared to be the gift of kindness—a
genuine gage d’amitié. The velveteen was immedi-
- ately returned to the donors with a tart and express-
ive missive, in which SIR-Robert very much
wished to know how it could be supposed that, as a Minister of the
Crown, he could be thought to go about the fields of Tamworth
covered with ears of wheat, and branded with “Free corn tº It was
a sort of fraudulent tattooing to which he would by no means
submit. The manufacturers of the velveteen were to consider
themselves snubbed—and they were snubbed accordingly.
Times are changed. Sin Rossar has since thought it a pity that
he should have so hastily returned what was intended to do him hon-
our, and, therefore, feeling that he now has “Free Cora” written upon
his heart, thinks it nothing more than appropriate that it should be
inscribed a thousand times upon his coat and waistcoat. Whereupon
Sin Robert has written a letter (of which the subjoined is a correct
copy) to the manufacturers of the rejected article. .
-
“TO MESSRS. •
“Gentlemen, In my deliberate judgment I do not hesitate to say that
never in my life did I feel so much regret that—from unforeseen circum-
stances—I returned into your hands a certain piece of velveteen, marked
with ears of wheat, and inscribed “Free Corn.”
“Gentlemen, I am not to be put aside from the course I now propose
to myself, by the taunts or the vituperations of any honourable person
soever. I confidently leave my reputation in the hands of posterity.
My opinions have undergone a great change with respect to the Corn
Laws, and I therefore unhesitatingly, and careless of clamour, propose to
you, gentlemen, that you should return to me the piece of velveteen
which, in my deliberate judgment I could not, at the time you offered it,
send to the tailor.
“Gentlemen, if I mistake not, it appears to me, on my deliberate
judgment, that there was sufficient velveteen to make up not only into a
coat, but also a waistcoat. Now, Gentlemen, I propose to wear the
waistcoat as soon as the measure can be taken. The coat, gentlemen,
I fear I cannot wear—unless my friend the Duke can be brought to
think differently—under three years. In 1849, I propose to put on that
garment; and in the meantime trust that my wearing the waistcoat-
occupying the post I do—will, upon your deliberate judgment, be
considered a step in advance of the right path.
*I have the honour to be
“Your obedient Servant,
“Robert Peel.”
“P.S. Several of my friends, who have been recently and suddenly
* convinced’ of the impolicy of the Corn Laws, begime to state that, in
due season they should have no objection to appear in velveteen as well
as myself. In proof of this I send you tºe measure of MR. Sidney
HERBERT, for one.”
A Lesson for wi. P.'s.
The Messrs. Evenington, of Ludgate Hill, have transmitted an extra-
ordinary piece of information to the papers. It appears that a cow—a
“she-cow.” as Tom Thumb has it—entered their shop. The cow looked
at herself in the mirrors there abounding, walked very gingerly amongst
a set of valuable porcelain jars, and walked out again, “doing no mischief.”
Oh that certain Members of Parliament would copy this example of
“the mother of the milky herd,”—walking into St.Stephens, just reflecting
themselves, and walk out again, “doing no mischief iº
PUNCH*S VISITS TO REMARKABLE PLACES.
HICKS'S HALL.
PREvious to entering on the subject of Hicks's Hall, it may be curious
to inquire who is Hicks? for “it is a settled point,” as the lawyers say,
that if there be no Hicks there can be, a fortiori, no hall belonging to that
imaginary individual. We have searched very accurately into the civic
annals for the purpose of ascertaining who is Hicks, where he originally
lived, and how, when, or why he flourished, but hitherto all our researches
have been far from satisfactory. There is a legend that the Hickses of
the Hall were burgesses of Clerkenwell, and had their domicile in or near
the Sessions House, which has encouraged the notion that Hicks's Hall
was, in fact, the Sessions House; but as there is no proof of this hypo-
thesis we unceremoniously throw it overboard. In the maze of perplexity
which surrounds the subject we have been compelled to draw upon the
imagination of our artist, who has drawn upon the wood such a Hall as it
is probable that Hicks—if he ever existed—might have inhabited. It is
very possible that he would have resided at the end of an avenue such as
we have before us, and we can only say that if any one will give us a more
accurate design of the very identical Hall of the very identical Hicks, we
will pay any sum of money that any one may have the impudence to
ask us for.
We confess that in the statistical part of this article, we have not been
particularly happy, but in the ideal and imaginative we have amply com-
pensated for any deficiency in the historical. But we defy any author, living
or dead, to make anything of such a subject as Hicks's Hall, when both
Hicks and his HALL enjoy but a very apocryphal existence. Neverthe-
less, as one of the remarkable places of England, we give it a place in our
series. ShakespeaRE has a line in which he talks about
“A local habitation and a name,”
but Hicks's Hall is an illustration of the exact opposite, for it is a name
without any local habitation belonging to it. With this excessively
“wise saw” we quit this very attractive subject.
THE VERDURE OF BUCKINGHAM.
In the Times’ report of the tomfooleries attendant on the late Bucking-
ham borough election, at which the juvenile MARQUIs of Channos was
returned as a fit and proper person to represent that independent borough
in Parliament, it was stated that
“The Marquis's colouris green. This is the Buckingham colour generally.”
Not only, we apprehend, is green the Buckingham colour, but also the
ducal colour generally; and the dye appears to be one of singular inten-
sity. It is a curious coincidence that the colour of the noble Marquis
should be green, since, according to the Rev. W. T. Eyre, his proposer,
he is only twenty-one years of age; so that it is hardly using too strong
an expression to say that he is a green young man.

EXTRAORDINARY MEETING OF THE DUKES.
(From our own Reporter.)
UNDERsTANDING that a meeting of several of the Dukes was to
take place last night in Palace Yard, I was early on the ground.
There were, however, no signs of the gathering until about two this
morning, when carriages—coming from various points—drove up
near to Canning's statue. Several parties then alighted; some of
them carrying very handsome lanterns. Footmen spread various
turkey carpets on the stones; and a van driving up, a table and easy
chairs were taken from it for the convenience of the distinguished
noblemen assembled. These preparations being completed, the
footmen took a “sentinel ground” and the police—having assured
themselves that the Dukes contemplated no breach of the peace—
made no attempt to interrupt the proceedings.
The DUKE of Nonfolk, being unanimously called to the chair,
said he would not trespass long upon the time of his noble brethren.
They all knew the cause of their meeting. They were—many of
them—in the direst state of intellectual destitution. (Cries of
“You’re right—tre are.”) He himself had heard of such a thing as
the History of England,-but he had never read it. (Cries of “We
believe it.”) He had heard of inductive philosophy, and Bacon too;
but he had never known what Bacon was in all his life. (Cries of
“shame?”) For, his own part, he did not care what Parliament did
for them ; as it was impossible that their condition could be worse.
The DUKE of Richmond declared that in all his days he had
never heard of Delolme on the English Constitution. If it hadn’t been
that his brother, Lond WILLIAM LENNox, had once read him a
little bit of Blackstone, (it was in one of his Lordship's novels,) he
should not have known that a Peer was not allowed to make Mem-
bers of Parliament.
The DUKE of BuckINGHAM assured the meeting that his condition
was no bit better than that of the last speaker. He knew something
of arithmetic, and was not ashamed to say that he knew a little of
poetry, in proof of which his Grace immediately recited,—
“But a bold peasantry, a country's pride
When once destroyed, can never be supplied.”
The DUKE or MARLBohough said that, in all his life, he had
never read a book upon political economy. He had heard of RI:
cARDo and MAculloch, and had once gone through half of one of
Cobb ETT's Registers, but that was all. His cry, therefore, to the
QUEEN was “Free knowledge for the Dukes.”
The Duke of Rutland addressed the meeting in the like strain;
declaring that he had never read anything, but the Game Laws,
which he had by heart—(his Grace repeated many of his apparently
favourite clauses). He also knew the price of game at London
poulterers', but nothing more. And his Grace spoke with such a
tº its earnestness of manner, it was impossible not to believe
In. - -
After a few other speeches of similar purport, a petition was agreed
upon to the QUEEN, praying that HER MAJEsty would do something,
as, in the expressive terms of the prayer, they (the Dukes) come
what might, “could not be worse.”
RAILWAY INTELLIGENCE.
Among the railways that have complied with the standing orders, is
the “John o'Groat and Land's End Junction, with Branches to Ben
Lomond and Battersea, and an Extension from Pannyer Alley to Peterloo
Direct.” The standing orders consisted of an order to stand anything that
the Chairman liked to call for at the bar of the house where the
company holds its meetings. -
We understand that the secretary of one of the new lines was upset in
a cab with all the plans, which were accordingly thrown out, and the
papers are in the position of dropped notices. -
The traffic on the Kensington railway, as taken from the bed-room
window of the house opposite, has consisted of a ton-and-a-half of coals
and a load of gravel. The pedestrian traffic of boys up and down the
line is somewhat increasing. A dividend has just been declared of the
cabbages grown on the bank. The policeman took one half, and the
secretary the other. We are happy to see that there is to be *
extension of the line of lettuces, which will be carried further north till
they join the trunk of the old beech-tree at the corner.

LITTLE FABLES FOR LITTLE POLITICIANS.
THE PARROT.
PARRoT was boasting of its extraordi-
nary powers of talking. “Name the
subject,” it pompously said, “which I
cannot say something upon.” “It’s
all very fine talking,” said its master,
“but the question is, when you talk,
how much of it do you understand **
The same question might be put to
Lord Brough AM, with about the
same chance of a reply.
THE OLD cock and THE BANTAM.
A BANTAM was once on the top of a dunghill. He kept crowing,
as he scratched up several pieces of grain, but as they were always
more than he could swallow, no sooner had he crowed than he was
obliged to let them drop again. An old cock—well known in his
neighbourhood as the cock of the walk—was always on the look out,
and as the cornfell from the bantam, he had nothing to do but to
pick it up, and turn it to his own use. At last the bantam, by dint
of scratching away the ground from under his feet, had nothing left to
stand upon, and the consequence was he tumbled down from the top
of the dunghill. As soon as the old cock saw this, he quietly jumped
into his place, and ever since has had the pickings of the corn all to
himself.
The bantam is Lonn John, and SIR. Robert is, of course, the
knowing old cock.
THE DRONES.
A swaax of drones lived for a number of years in a rich beehive, |
helping themselves to the best of the honey, and contributing nothing
to the store. This was endured for such a length of time, that the
drones at last really believed that the honey was of their own making,
and that the hive could not get on without them. Whenever a poor ſº
“busy, busy bee” came to ask for food, they would set upon him in
top of a powder magazine, “and would have been blown to pieces
only you knew perfectly well I was close at hand to save you º
We do not know how it is, but the wonderful way in which Mn.
O'Connell has kept out of all explosions, reminds us very much of
the deep old file above.
THE CHILTERN HUNDRFIP&
(From our own correspºndent)
These delightful little Hundreds have latterly become a place of
fashionable resort. We have Lond Ashley staying with us, and other
distinguished members of the House of Commons. The Hundreds have
not been so gay for many years past; and during the season Lond
Aarhua Lennox, together with other celebrated characters, have alter-
nately acted as Stewards. There is some talk of races for the Chiltern
Hundreds, if they continue their present attraction. Several individuals,
who have just broken off from engagements which they have been under
for some years, have sought distraction in the excitement of acting as
Stewards in the romantic little Hundreds of Chiltern.
Some have come among us to drink the waters of political oblivion
which abound in this romantic spot. Others have been to try the cold
water ºure, and Loan Anthun Lennox has done so upon the recom-
mendation of his brother, the Duke of Richmond. It agreed with him
very well, and he has gone back to the Treasury quite another man.

round.

“Protection.” This was more than the blood of the bees could

We implore our venerable Dukes to have the above little Fable all
read to them at least once a day.
THE CUNNING OstLER.
.AN ostler wanted to catch several wild horses, that had long eluded
his grasp. He whistled to them, coaxed them, called them by all
sorts of winning names, but the horses would not be caught by chaff.
The ostler at last went to them with a large corn measure in his
hand. The horses, at first so wild and restive, became all of a sudden
tame, gradually approached the ostler—looked into his measure,
sniffed the corn, and—after turning it over and nibbling it a little—
quietly allowed themselves to be led whichever way the ostler
wished.
In the same way, SIR Robert PEEL, in the new field he has lately
entered, will catch several members who have always avoided him,
by going to them with a corn measure in his hand.

CHANGES OF MINISTERIAL HEADS,
WORSLEY has been very
hard upon certain of the Min-
isters, especially on SIR Robert
PEEL and SIR JAMEs GRAHAM,
for abandoning their former
opinions respecting Free Trade.
His Lordship, nevertheless,
failed to prove that the change
on their parts was not for the
better. But perhaps LoRD
WoRsley's text is, literally, “He
that is unjust, let him be un-
just still.” Be that as it may,
the noble lord, by holding up
to these statesmen the reflec-
tions of their former selves in
the Mirror of Parliament, has
much diverted both the House
and the Public. He might,
however, have created much
more amusement, had he been
possessed of certain means
which, for the interests of science, no less than of jocosity, we wish had
been at his command.
We believe that MR. DEVILLE, the phrenologist, exhibits several casts
of the heads of so many individuals, taken at different periods of life, and
under different circumstances of mental and moral culture. What a pity
it is that casts of our statesmen's heads are not taken regularly every five
or seven years l Had this been done, Lord Worsley might--if there is
truth in Phrenology—have held up the PEEL and IGRAHAM of other days
to the very eye. He might have said, “Behold the Premier and Home

Trade. Here, what a development: there, what a deficiency What a

that
There is only one slight objection to this mode of argument, in its
bearings upon LoRD WoRSLEY’s cause. The increase may have been in
the intellectual and moral ; the decrease in the lower regions of the min-
isters' crania. It would hardly have answered his Lordship's purpose to
have said, “Here you see that SIR. Robert PEEL has a quarter of an inch
more of “Conscientiousness,' and SIRJAMEs GRAHAM at least a tenth more
of ‘Benevolence,” than they had six years ago; and that the reflective
and perceptive organs of both are five-eighths more prominent than
they were then.” For then it is clear that a fact would have been estab-
lished, quod—as concerning Load WoRsley's line—decidedly, NoN erat
demonstrandum.
NICHOLAS AND THE NUNS.
We know not by what accident the subjoined epistle found its
It was evidently—being written by a lady
of quality—intended for the Morning Post. Nevertheless we give it.
“Sir, I have been very much distressed at reading a scandalous
account of the treatment of some nuns at a place they call Minsk—if,
indeed, there is such a place, which I very much doubt. The account
goes on to say that a barbarous man—an archi—archi—archi something
—in the employment of that dear man the EMPEROR Nicholas has
cruelly flogged, and beaten, and tortured, and at length killed some nuns,
and all for the sake of religion; to make 'em turn Greeks, I believe.
Well, the Emperor—it is printed—sent a letter written by his own
gracious hand, in which, writing of his officer, he, in the words I believe
of the Poet BUNN, but correct me if it's BYRoN–
“Very much applauded him for what he had done,’—
thereby thinking it very proper that poor women (for religion's sake)
should be lashed, and chained, and killed.
“Now, sir, I don't believe a word of this. It’s all a piece of slander,
concocted, I have no doubt, by some—radicals I believe you call 'em—
who sneer at everybody with crowns and coronets upon their heads.
Sir, when the EMPERoR Nicholas was here, I had the honour to be intro-
duced to him. Can I ever forget the presence of that magnificent man?
Can I ever cease to remember the balmy look that beamed in his celestial
eyes; the musical smile that played about his imperial mouth ; the soft-
ness—soft as evening breezes whispering amid the orange groves of bella
Italia, the softness, I say, of his condescending voice I Is it likely that
so splendid—so dear a man would demean himself by having nuns
whipped and put in chains, and made to work at building—what do you
call 'em—fortifications :
“Sir, I have a rose—a rose presented to me by His IMPERIAL
-
MAJESTY in the gardens of Chiswick. That rose is faded; but when I
look upon it, even in its ruins, and remember the glorifying effulgence
that lighted the EMPEROR's whole intellectual fabric, when in much better
than Parisian French he told me that that rose was not si belle que moi—
when I remember this, and a thousand other nameless prettinesses, I
cannot, I will not believe the wicked stories of the tortured nuns.
“The dear creature couldn't do it, and so pray contradict so shameful
a calumny.

Qſìje 33lotkate of £ilburn.
KILBURN has lately been the scene of an invasion of a right of way,
which has been met by a determined resistance on the part of the friends
of free footpaths. It seems that the inhabitants are justly incensed
at a recent attempt to stop up twelve ancient footpaths leading from
the Avenue Road to Kilburn. The people have put forward a spirited
manifesto, calling upon “everybody” to insist on going through the dis-
puted footpath, in which case “nobody” would suffer. We fear, how-
ever, that this vigorous demand upon the enthusiasm of the whole popu-
lation of the British Empire will not induce the entire public to rush to
Kilburn to try the right of way, for the sake of the residents in the
immediate neighbourhood.
We, however, wish them success in their patriotic efforts to open the
arteries of Kilburn, and prevent that stoppage in the lungs of the
Avenue Road which might prove fatal to the health of the neighbourhood.
We had rather see a martial spirit evinced in behalf of the native right
of way than in the cause of warfare.

THE MILITIA Movement.
Baitish military ardour, like the measles, is catching, and the valour
of the Brook Green Volunteer Militia Man has kindled a sort of
scarlatina, or desire to appear in scarlet uniform, amongst the youth of
Dover. It is delicious to know that the spirit of military enthusiasm
prevails in that port which would probably be the first landingplace of
an invading enemy. With the Brook Green Militia Man as an inland
hero, and the youth of Dover to protect us on the side of the sea, we
may sit down comfortably in the assurance of the security of our “right
little tight little island.”
The mothers of England may rock their babies on their knees, and
remembering the suburban soldiery of the West, as well as the warlike
youth of the South-East, may warble in tranquillity over their infants’
cradles the following touching ballad:-
Oh slumber, my darling 1 thy mother's all right,
Thy father will never be wanted to fight;
The youths who reside on the coast of the sea,
They all will be soldiers, dear infant, for thee.
We had written thus far, when our special express from the news-
vendors arrived by the overland staircase, bringing extracts from the
Dover paper. We find that the Cinque Ports were in some commotion
on account of a rumour that MR. Hunt, the town-councillor, the Sheen-
LAL of Dover, had received letters from the Duke of WELLINgton, the
Cinque Port Pacha, refusing to sanction the enrolment of the young
Sheikhs and shop-boys into a corps of Volunteer Infantry. The Duke,
who combines all the firmness of Appallah Ben Coolly with the vigour
of the MEER. Singhs, has written the following very characteristic note,
which it will be seen dashes the ALBERT bat from the brow of the Dover
youth, snatches the bayonet from their hands, and tears off the uniform
in which they had in imagination already dressed themselves. We give
the document, which is curious as a regular right down Wellington
despatch. We will, however, interweave our comments with the text.
* London, Feb. 3rd, 1846.
“Fºun-Marshal, rue Duke or Wellington presents his compliments to
Ma. Hunt. He has received his letter.”
Who has received whose letter? Has MR. Hunt received his own
letter
“The Duke is the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, and the Commander-in-Chief
of the Army.”
This little passage contains two “great facts,” and is therefore full of
historical, statistical, and national interest. The Duke is not, however,
the “unqualified” head of the army, as Lond ELLENBoRough may be
termed the “unqualified” head of the navy, and EARL St. GERMANs
the “unqualified” head of the Post-Office. No! there is a “but,” a
qualification after the statement of the fact that His Grace is Commander-
in-Chief.
“But he is not aware that in either capacity he has legal authority to enable him to
organise and form bodies of armed men in the Cinque Ports.”
In replying to this, we are reminded of the celebrated rebuff of the
milk-maid, in the old song-
“‘Nobody asked you, sir, she said.”
Nobody asked the Duke of WELLINgron to organise and form bodies
of armed men in the Cinque Ports. The valorous request of a few boys
to be allowed to dress up in regimentals, and play at soldiers, should not
have been tortured into an alleged application to the Duke to organise
bodies of armed men in the Cinque Ports. His Grace next plunges into
an entirely new subject, without even beginning a new paragraph.
“He has no information upon the intention of the calling out of the Militia.”
This innocence of the intentions of his colleagues is rather affectingly
brought out; but we come next to a piece of composition in which gram-
maris. battered to atoms, and LINDLEY MURRay's lines are blown away
into thin air.
"...It has been stated that one of her Majesty's servants has given notice, in the House
ºf Parliament of which he is not amember, of his intention to introduce a bill for the
Amendment of the Militia Laws. The Duke has not heard that such Bill has been
introduced.
“John Huxºr, Esq., Dover.”
How has notice been given by a Member of Parliament in the House
of which he is not a member? This is a climax, and the subject must
accordingly be dropped.
A SUBJECT For Post ERITY.
T.W. suggest, since the Emperon of Russia contributed so largely to
the Nelson pillar, that one of the devices on the base be devoted to a
subject in his honour. What say you, gentlemen, to the following:-
Nicholas signing the Ukase sentencing the Polish Nuns to be flogged?
Granite is the very material for the subject.
MORE DWARFS.
IN consequence of the success of GENERAL Tom
Thumb, diminutiveness appears to have come
into fashion, and we have not only an English
THUMB, but a Spanish speculator has imported
a Thump, for the purpose of having a dip into
Joan Butt's pocket. The American Thurma
being-in-Scotland, and jealous of any other
Thumb having a finger in the pie, has addressed
a letter to the people of London, entreating
them not to bestow their patronage on any oppo-
sition littleness, but to-wait his return to the
metropolis. This is rather worse than the dog
in the manger, for the avaricious little dog is
positively pocketing all he can-in-Scotland, but
feels annoyed that he cannot be draining the
public pocket in two-countries at once, and is
ealous of the crumbs-which he has left at
the Egyptian-Hall being picked up by the English Dwarf that has come
after him.
The fact is, there appears to be a regular glut of Dwarfs, or Dwarves,
at this particular time, and there is some danger of overstocking the
market. We are surprised that an agitation is not commenced on behalf
of native littleness, calling upon the Government to lay a heavy tax upon
the foreign article, or put a protective duty on the Spanish gentleman who
has just come over. If this, however, were the case, GENERAL Tom Thumb
would have been subjected to the tax as a raw article of American
produce. We believe Dwarfs are not mentioned in the new Tariff, but
the principles of Free Trade would be as applicable to them as to any
other article of speculation. They might be admitted as measurement
goods upon an ad valorem duty.

DUCAL DUMMIES.
A Few nights ago, the Dukes of Buckingham and Richmonn afforded
to the House of Commons two curious specimens of their manufacture of
Members of Parliament. The articles were very much approved.
They were called Chandos and Lennox, and walked up the body of the
House “jointed just enough to move.” They took the oaths and their
seats, and there is little doubt—so perfectis their internal machinery-
that they will never fail to say “aye” and “no” according to the will of
their makers. They are wound up to go for even seven years if neces-
sary; and-considered in every respect as pieces of machinery—are very
far in advance of cuckoo clocks. It is reported that the Marquis of
ExETER,--who lately gave one thousand pounds to a church, though
we have never heard of any remission of any part of his Corn-
Law rents—is very desirous to copy the example of his friends the Dukes,
but meets with most vexatious obstacles. The aristocracy are, at times,
prone to charge the plebeian world with a disrespect for their order.
Surely no such feeling can exist; or if unhappily it should, it must die
in penitence and shame, seeing that Dukes are so enlightened, so patri-
otic, that—not caring to trouble constituencies—they make their senators
themselves. We really do not see why these ingenious noblemen should
not add to their titles that of * doll-makers to the House of Commons.”

SUNDAY TRADING.
CERTAIN zealous folks, of the very pious locality of Lambeth
—is it that the Archbishop's palace exerts so benign an influ-
ence thereabout —have banded together to put down Sunday
trading. Little boys and girls should not buy wicked
oranges and apples—no better than apples of the Dead Sea

strong hand of the beadle, and the police have stringent
directions to watch the goings-on of the vendors of hard.

and-ink rapture—to be able to praise the Home Secretary.
He certainly makes the feeling a great luxury from making
it so difficult to attain. SIR JAMEs at once put down the
pseudo-pious. He would have nothing to do with their
measure. Government would reject it; for SIR JAMEs
“could not see wherefore the poor man should not have his
enjoyments—his pipe of tobacco, his drop of beer, and his
newspaper—on the Sunday, as well as the rich.” Very
true, SIR JAMEs ; but you might have said more than the
rich, inasmuch as the wealthy may—for leisure and enjoy-
ment—make every day of the seven a Sunday; whereas the
poor man has but his one day—a day that foolish zealots
would turn into a time of melancholy and sadness, thinking
themselves “pious, when they’re only bilious.”

A VISIT TO THE PUNCH of FICE
BY THE RING of saxoNY AND DR. cARus.
EING, like SIR. E. Bulwer Lytton,
believersin “the great German nation”
as critics, we extract from the very
characteristic work of DR. CARus,
who accompanied the KING of SAx-
oNY on his visit to England in 1844,
the following account of a visit to
our Office. We remember the inci-
dent perfectly. We translate, as
literally as the language will allow,
from the Docton’s work, England und
Schottland in jahre 1844, ron Dr. C. G.
Carus, ster theil Berlin, 1845:—
- “In the evening we again enjoyed the
| richly-tasting- though - appetite-of-the-
uninitiated-foreigner-provoking-and-over-loading-English-dinner. (Leck-
erhaften-sonst-aber-des- ungewcihtes-Ausländers-appetit-erregenden-und-
gleich-uberladenden-Mittagsmahl.)
“His of all highest and most gracious Majesty indulged in the contem-
plation-provoking-and-indigestion-in-most-cases-averting pipe, and after
longest drawn puffs, suddenly me, his favoured and devoted Chamber-and
Privy-Councillor on the back slapping, said—“Shall we to the laughter-
provoking-and-with-kings-freely-but-inoffensively-joking Punch (Spott-
haftes-undmit-Königen-im-freien-unschuldigen-scherzen-spiclendes-Punch

English carriages, each by four foaming and glossy horses in harness of
the brightest-and-with-the-most-expensive-ornaments-bedecked. (We
spare the reader the German equivalent, which fills four lines,) leather-
caparisoned, drawn, were at the door. The faithful, Royal-and-Court-
highest-ceremonial-coachman Johann, proud to carry his Majesty, drove
with impetuous speed to the with-dirt-obscured-but-with-the-rays-of-
humour-magnificently-irradiated region of Whitefriars.
“Here, indeed, were we royally and with beaming cordiality by the
intelligent and maliciously smiling (høhnisch lachend) Punch received.
Ach Gott t . This was an evening to be ever by us of the royal suit
remembered. I, to-grave-studies-from-my-youth-addicted-and-at-Ulm-
by-my-comrades-of-the-Kneipe-often-as- “Dummy’-(Dunmkopf)-saluted
man, felt inspired by the atmosphere, and, the permission of his Gracious
Majesty first procured, retired to a small, and with-mean-furniture-
sparingly-filled room, which was the central point (das central punct),
as I was informed, of the great I (des grosses Ich) which, subjectively
considered, may be described as humour of the finest and most
Shaksperian,-as-by-the-Germans-alone-understood-character, and ob-
jectively contemplated is Punch. (We have not the least notion what the
Doctor means; we remember he insisted on being left alone in the
Editor's room, where he remained for nearly half-an-hour, groaning
heavily but refusing all offers of assistance or refreshment. We did no:
know till we read his book, how he was employed.) |
“Here did I earnestly and with true German honesty (wahre Deutsche
Tapferkeit) to make a joke endeavour—unhappily—without success.
“How often have I excellent jokes in church, and otherwise at my
leisure in unsuitable places, made? Yet now, after strenuous and long-
repeated efforts, my brain, without the least glimpse of humour, to dry and
unsatisfactory scholastic recollections abandoned remained.
“His Majesty, who knew the object for which I the small room had
slily sought, seemed at my failure, in his indulgent serenity, disappointed.
“Here, in this magnificent establishment, is joke-making in its highest
and most sublimated form, at-an-immense-expense-by-richly-remunerated.

and through-the-Post-office-distributed copies amounts, as I was by a
small but intelligent printer's boy informed, to half a million; and is
into all the in-this vastly-extended-empire-used-languages, by the authors
themselves—of-languages-universally-perfect-masters—translated. Gifts
in rich profusion, from kings and ministers, lie in warehouses under the
printing-office—but these, by no bribe, could I induce the guardian of
them to show us.
“That evening remains in my memory a clear and brilliant, with-rivers-
of-pleasant-recollection-perpetually-green oasis. But one regret is present
—that I could not make a joke.”

“WANTED, A FEW TURNOVERS.”
We saw the above announcement in the window of a printer's in
Fleet Street. At any other time we should have said, apply to Sº
Robert PEEL ; but we are afraid that at present he will require all the
“turnovers” he has in his employ to work the new engine he has
lately set up—the Repeal of the Corn Laws.

PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.
We have perceived with great pleasure, that an attempt has been at
last made to improve the National Gallery. The architectural elevation
has been improved by the addition of two gigantic chimney-pots, which
are thrown up into very high relief by a couple of very graceful cowls
that run into the air, and stand out very refreshingly against the Charing
Cross. Empyrean. The object of these chimney-pots is apparently to give
a loftiness which was previously wanted, and perhaps also to represent a
couple of office files on which to file the receipts for building the Nelson
column. It is said that these chimneys have been erected for the purpose
of letting out the smoke from the apartments of the housekeeper of the
National Gallery. We presume, therefore, that the housekeeper was in
the habit of consuming his own smoke until he got the chimneys added
to his residence.
With regard to the general effect of the two cowls upon the “finest site
in Europe,” we are sorry we cannot say much in its favour. They cer-
tainly throw up the Nelson column, but their influence on the tail of
George THE Fourth’s Hoase is by no means satisfactory. When viewed
in conjunction with the chimneys, the fountains also assume a new phase
of absurdity. They are diminished from wash-hand basins to those little
arrangements on ladies' toilette tables for putting rings upon. We regret
to say, that though the chimneys are rather elegant in their appearance,
the smoke declines to curl gracefully—as smoke, according to the poet,
always ought to do.
BREAD AND BLOOD.
ON the sitting of the American Congress on the 26th ult, MR.
WENTwoRTH gave notice that he should move as follows:–
“But no proposition for arbitration concerning the said territory (Oregon) shall be
made by the Government of the United States, until it shall be satisfied that the
markets of Great, Britain shall be permanently open to the bread-stuffs of the
United States.”
There is here an unmistakable connexion,-it is that of bread and
blood. “Satisfy us that you will take our corn,” says JonATHAN,
“and we'll think the matter over; we will not then be in a hurry to
go to war about that tarnation Oregon. No, Britishers ; for we
calculate we shall make more dollars out of you as customers than
as enemies. Let us knit our hearts together with our purse-strings,
and then our friendship will be etarnal l’” And Jon ATHAN speaks
wisely; albeit his speech rings with dollars—(it always does).
Open our ports, and JonATHAN will send us wheat instead of gun-
powder; he will pour cheap loaves into our cupboards, and will not
damage our navy with his cannon-balls. Our pigs and cattle shall
rejoice in maize and Indian corn; and Johnny-cakes, excellent as
they must be—(for has not their goodness been vouched for by
LoRD MoRPETH !)—will melt in our astonished mouths at our fire-
sides. Considered after this fashion, the Corn Laws are no other
than gunpowder-laws; and the protection of landlords is one and
the same thing with the protection of our coasts: whilst the
Newcast LEs, the BuckINGHAMs, and the Rich Monds are very
great guns, noisy and mischievous. Now do away with the Corn
Laws, and we bind and gag that very fine ogre war; we reduce his
establishment in a tremendous degree : we discharge thousands of
his footmen and his horsemen; and for his guns, instead of con-
stantly feeding them with very expensive powder and shot, we only
|
use them on birth-day and other state occasions, to make loud
Rich Mond speeches; yes, to speak with the voice of Dukes; that
is to say—but to say it with a great bounce—nothing but blank
cartridge.
cAMPBELL's LIFE OF BROUGHAM.
ConsiderABLE curiosity will be felt to know what Lord CAMPBELL will
say of his friend BRough AM when it comes to the time of the former to
tackle the latter in the “Lives of the Lord Chancellors.” We can fancy
that we trace in Lond CAMPBELL's Life of HATron—the dancing Chancellor
—a few sly hits at BRough AM. While tapping HATTON's toes, the
biographer seems to be at the same time rapping BRough AM's knuckles.
Surely the passages in which we are informed of the effect produced on the
people by the elevation of the former, are intended to convey several
severe digs against the latter. We are told, ostensibly of HATTon, but
we suspect covertly of BRough AM, that “when the report was first
spread that he was to be raised to the Chancellorship, most people
regarded it as a joke, and would not believe in its possibility until they
saw him openly presiding in the Court.”
LoRD CAMPBell evidently means this as a hit at his friend WAUx, whose
elevation was a joke to all but to the suitors in Chancery. For them it
was a very serious matter. -
In the Life of Shaftesbury too, LoRD BRough AM evidently comes in for
no small share of satire. Speaking professedly of Shaftesbury, but
really of Bhougham, Lond Campbell observes: “Had he called in Judges
and Masters in Chancery as assessors, he might have avoided any palpable
absurdities, but despising all learning that he did not know, he thought he
was fitter to decide than any of them, and he scorned their advice.” This
may be like SHAFTEsbury a little, but it is like BRough AM a great deal
more ; and, as it was said of CAESAR and Pompey, that they were “very
much alike,” especially Pompey, it must be admitted that Shaftesbury
and BRough AM seem to have been very much alike in their arrogance,
especially BRough AM. We thought that CAMPBELL would hardly throw
away the chance of having a fling at BRough AM, and it is clear that he
has not done so.

about to be assassinated. Why should it be the “last week” of the

suicidal practise. The last time we heard of the brute he was in excellent

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH's POLITICAL DICTIONARY. A PROPHECY FROM THE POTATO.
ENLIsTMENT. The process by which fine, active young men | WE remember a nursery fragment—as, doubtless, does the reader
engage themselves as private soldiers, under the impression that they
will have nothing to do but talk to the nursery-maids in the park, or
ride upon race horses at full gallop in splendid hussar uniforms.
A recruit is not liable to be proceeded against for leaving his wife
and children chargeable to the parish ; so that enlistment is the only
cheap method of obtaining a divorce in the lower grades of society.
Equality. A general levelling, which, when the world is full of
flats, may be perfectly practicable.
Equer RY. From the French ecurie, a stable, an officer of the
royal household; because, according to MILLER, the household
derives from it a stable character.
: EQUITY is, according to BLAckston E, synonymous with true
justice, and is the soul and spirit of law. As spirits do not dwell on
this earth, we can understand the visits of real equity being few and
far between, in accordance with its angelic character. The humorous
MR. SELDEN-by-the-bye, what a melancholy age it must have been
when the lawyers were the best humourists—calls equity “a roguish
thing,” because it varies with the conscience of the Chancellor; and
as that is larger or narrower, so is equity. Had he lived in these
days, he would have compared it to a pair of Indian-rubbertrowsers,
which, when the straps are cut, fly half-way up the leg, and leave it
bare, which he would probably have declared to be typical of the
fate of the client. Equity gives relief when law has failed, the
relief often consisting of the process of relieving the suitor of his
money.
Esquin E, (literally, a shield-bearer,) is the next title or dignity
to that of knight. Some derive the word esquire from equus, a
horse; and in Germany the untitled nobility are still called the
equestrian order; and it would seem that the company at Astley's,
being all of the equestrian order, would rank with the Barons of
Germany. The sons of the nobility, and the members themselves
of certain professions, are rightful esquires; and writers on prece-
dence talk of esquires having been created by investiture with
silver spurs, which has given way to the custom of investiture with
a steel pen, for esquires are now created every day by having letters
addressed to them. It has been said that such esquires have quite
as good a title as the rest, for they can prove their title to the letter.
A DUCAL POULTERER,
MR. BRIGHT, in allusion to the benefits and beauties of the game laws,
said that “in the year 1844 the Duke of RUTLAND “paid 915l. for
game damages on 389 acres of land.” Well His Grace knows what
he is about; for as he is the largest wholesale poulterer in England—
duly carting his hares and pheasants to Newgate Market—he can show
a very pretty profit on the transaction. Besides, his Grace also turns a
decent penny with hare-skins; nearly all the buyers of the article being,
as we understand, nothing more than middle-men, or middle-women, (as
the case may be,) to the DUKE of RUTLAND. For if a noble deals in the
flesh of hares, we don't see why he shouldn't trade in the skins.
_
—running thus:–
“The butcher, the baker,
The candlestick maker,
All jumped out of a rotten potato 1"
We know not whether the good FATHER MATHEw had this dog.
grel in his thoughts, but he has hopefully suggested that future
plenty may be made to germinate from the present potato blight.
The noble meek-hearted man has written a letter to the Cork
Eraminer, in which he dilates on the use and importance of Indian
corn as an article of food. He says, “I hope for many ulterior
advantages from what at present is a calamity: our people will be
deterred from depending solely upon potatoes for food;” and he
concludes as follows:– -
“With the gratifying prospects now before us of sufficient remunerative labourfor
the whole unemployed population of Ireland, I indulge in the expectation of soon seeing
the potato reduced to its proper position of a vegetable, to be used with flesh meat, &c.,
as an accompaniment, and no longer to be esteemed as an exclusive article of food,
except for hogs.”
We fervently hope so too. And when Paddy shall enjoy his own
pork, with a bit of Sunday mutton or beef; shall break his daily
bread of good wholesome corn; when he shall be enabled to secure
to his family these small comforts, originating in the present dire
distress—made ultimately attainable by him in consequence of the
attention of the legislature to his present misery—then let the little
children of Ireland be taught the above-named doggrel as a house-
hold song of comfort and thanksgiving, and let them (generously
assuming the advent of the maker of candlesticks) pipe from con-
tented, full bellies, the realised prophecy:-
“The butcher, the baker,
The candlestick maker, |
DID jump out of a rotten potato.”
We think that Victon IA herself would hear as sweet music in
this as ever she listened to in “God save the Queen.”
EC CLESIASTICAL EXHIBITION S.
As it appears that the taking money
at the doors of the Cathedrals, in the
same way as payment is received at the
entrances of a theatre, will continue
a permanent practice, we recommend
the erection of regular money-takers'
boxes, where a Bishop or a Dean might
occasionally attend in person, and thus
by gaining a knowledge of the actual
receipts, be able to judge of the honesty
of inferior officers. A comfortable ar-
rangement with “pay here” written in
conspicuous letters over the wicket,
would give greater respectability to the
exhibition than the verger keeping the
door half closed, and parleying about
the price of admission with any one who
may happen to present himself at the
entrance without being aware of the
nature of the arrangements. It is a
common practice with Toll Contractors
to attend in person occasionally at the
various gates, so that by the receipts of
the day they may check the correct-
ness of the returns made by the ordinary
turnpike men. The Cathedrals and
Abbeys of the metropolis having become
recognised sources of profit, there need
be no delicacy whatever on the part of
the ecclesiastical dignitaries, who, hav-
ing an interest in the receipts, cannot
think it a compromise of dignity to look after their own business.

CATCHING ABD-EL-KADER.
HERE can’t be the slightest question
That the French are a very great nation,
But the special line
Ihºwhich they shine,
Išthe spread of civilization.
With pride they may point to Algiers,
And ask you, in Africa where is
Another town
Where a man may sit down,
To dineralaſcarte as at WEmiss!
Sºme millions of men and money,
Aninsignificant priče is,

Of Mahometan souls,

From Bona to the Saharaº;
But they'reallajoke,
And end in-smoke,
As wituess the caverms of Dabra.
The world'says BUGEAUD's troopers
Give no quarter at all in battle,
But 'tis false, I declare,
They often spare
The women, and always the cattle.
With these philanthropic feelings,
Can anything be harder,
Than that glorious France,
In each advance,
Should be thwarted by ABD-El-KADER }
So with unfeign'd satisfaction,
We heard that the conqueror of Isly,
Brave MARSHAL Bugeaud,
Was determined to go
And take this chieftain so grizly.
He made the most perfect arrangements
For catching him ere he started,
But whenever he got
To a suitable spot,
ABD-El-KADER had just departed.
When the Marshal after him trundled, -
To secure the rascal trusting,
All at once he'd appear,
And annoy his rear
In a manner the most disgusting.
There was great expectation in Paris,
But to the War Minister's sorrow,
The telegraph's tale
Ran thus, without fail,
“The capture's put off till to-morrow.”
Then the Marshal sent GENERAL Yussuf,
With his cavalry to match him;
They ne'er met with defeat,
And always beat;
But somehow, could never catch him.
France won victories by dozens—
And each day, as the Marshal strode on,
We were sure to hear
That they'd miss'd the Emir,
But kill'd the horse he rode on.
Six times they’ve shot Bou-MAza,
And given his Arabs a licking;
But each time he was slain,
He got up again—
And still is alive and kicking.
And there's one fact grows more puzzling
As one thinks about it the longer;--
ABD-EL-KADER's horde,
Tho' oft put to the sword,
Keeps still getting stronger and stronger.
But still, that he will be taken,
Is certain from one reflection—
That 'tis ever so long,
Since the folks at Toulon,
Made “arrangements for his reception.”
If the Marshal can't make the capture,
He'd better at once have own’d it;
And to save delays,
Said, in play-bill phrase,
He'd “indefinitely postponed” it.
Of course we wouldn't insinuate
That brave Bugeaud could throw the hatchet ;
But we venture to print
MRs. GLAsse's old hint
About dressing a hare—“first catch it.”
TURNIPS, IN PARLIAMENT.
SIR CHARLEs. NAPIER—who, as an agriculturist, grows his own
oakum, and taps his ownitar—has delivered a very capitallecture to
the House of Commons, startling that solemn assembly, with the
extent of his farming information. It was as if NEPTUNE had given
up his trident for a pitchfork, and left the cultivation of sea-weed
for that of mangel-wurzel. He flew from red-wheate to, rye-from
rye to clover—like any bee-gathering; honey therefrom. Finally,
however, he made a grand rest upon turnips. Glowing, dilating
with the subject, and looking very hard at Colon EL SIBTHoRP and
MR. Won EHouse at the time, the gallant sailor said—
“He had one field with turnips as large as the head of most of the gentlemen of that
house. (Laughter). He had had his sheep feeding on these turnips for the last two
months.”
We have a respect for the House of Commons—a respect that is
sometimes, like a cold, very inconvenient to us from its intensity.
We, therefore, feel that respect very much violated by the Commo-
dore's comparison of turnips with the heads of Parliament, for in
how many cases must the turnips carry it hollow For we know
what excellent uses may be made of a turnip. We know—as
school-boys, do we not recollect it?—how the turnip may be illumi-
nated. We remember how we have scooped out the turnip, and
cutting certain holes in its round, have put a lighted taper in it, and
then, promoting it to a high place, have not rays of light shone from
it, lighting men afar Now, can we honestly say this of every head
in Parliament? How many such heads, though in the high place of
St. Stephen's, are dark as dark-lanthorns—profoundly opaque—
emitting not one solitary ray for the guidance of the wanderers out-
side, poor fellows, struggling in the bogs and mire of ignorance and
error Therefore are they more worthless than NAPIER's turnips.
Again, the Commodore has said that his turnips have fed sheep.
Now, have we not seen, by the votes against Corn Law Repeal, that
certain turnips on Parliamentary shoulders will not consent to feed
even men NAPIER, henceforth respect your turnips. In future,
insult not that valuable esculent by any such derogatory comparisons.
Let turnips keep their places—and certain members theirs.
A Pretty Turn Gut.
AN advertisement in the Times the other day announced for sale “a
pony equipage, calculated to carry four persons of the most elegant
description.” It is certainly a great point in favour of this equipage that
four individuals crammed into it would fairly come under the head of “per-
sons of the most elegant description.” It generally strikes us that four
hulking people, seated behind some miserable little under duty pony—who
is indeed frightfully under the duty assigned to him—have the most awk-
ward appearance possible. A miniature equipage that can give lightness
and even elegance to the look of four persons in this usually humiliating
position, must really be worth purchasing. We have been in the habit of
regarding such a thing as a mere vehicle for ridicule, instead of—as this
appears to be—a vehicle for elegance.

PRESENTATION OF COLOURS TO THE BROOK GREEN VOLUNTEER.
- =s
HAMMERSMITH having become naturally proud of her military
prowess, which she owes entirely to her gallant volunteer, it has
been at length determined to present him with a pair of colours, in order
to give some colour to his warlike proceedings. The brave creature has
often been heard to declare that he would nail his standard to the pike-
staff of his country's liberties, but the recollection that he has had
...; to nail has suddenly flashed across his fevered brain, and the
hero of a hundred pelting showers has
“Wiped away a tear.”
The aspect of valour in distress has touched the heart of a British
female, who has determined to make a present of colours to the Brook
Green Volunteer. Feeling assured that every true-born Englishman
must feel an interest in everything concerning the efficiency of our
soldiery, we have no hesitation in giving an account of the interesting
ceremony.
The Brook Green Volunteer, though he has never been in action, has,
in imagination, rallied round the British throne twice a-week for the last
month, and intends adding materially to the security of the crown, every
Monday night, till further notice.
It is owing to him that the neighbourhood feels able to rest in security.
Conscious that the Brook Green Volunteer is at his post, the Lily of Ham-
mersmith sleeps peacefully in her bed, the Rose of Shepherd's Bush
reposes on her pillow of rosy posies, and the Dahlia of Kensington Cres-
cent feels assured of tranquillity. It must be evident, therefore, that the
Volunteer, as the guardian of the fair daughters of the western suburb,
SS
-
must be a “real blessing to mothers” in that too sensitive locality. In a
neighbourhood where
“Five thousand souls shake in ten thousand shoes,”
as the poet gº." hath it, a hero is a boon, and valour must be at
least twenty per cent. higher than it would be in any other market. .
The ceremony of presenting colours is nearly the same on all occasions,
and in all regiments, so that in the case of the Brook Green Volunteer it
was only necessary to follow a precedent. It is usual to bring out the
old colours, and, furling them up like an umbrella, they are put into a
sort of umbrella-case, and marched into the rear, when they are either
destroyed or given to the colonel's little girls, to make dolls' bonnets of:
We know at this moment a sylph-like creature, with arms of wax, and
body of bran, who is always dressed in bits of the old flag of the 34th,
with “Culloden” written on her polka, and “Minorca” figuring on the
crown of her bonnet.
But to proceed with our description of the ceremony. Miss Snooks,
from one of the thousand laundries that abound in the neighbourhoºd,
had been selected to present the Colours. They were received on his
knees by the Brook Green Volunteer, who made a few observations
on the art of war, and gave a long quotation from Caesar de Bello Gallico.
He took a rapid view of heroism from HANNIBAL down to Shaw, the
Life Guardsman, and interspersed his remarks with anecdotes of some."
our most distinguished living sentinels. Before he had concluded his
discourse, every one had left the spot, and we are therefore unable to say
precisely what followed.
A VOICE FROM THE COMMONS TABLE.
You may talk about the banquets of Lucullus and Apicius,
Of the Regent's petit soupers so volatile and vicious;
Of Turtle soup at BIRch's, of Whitebait at Blackwall,
But the banquet nightly spread on me is rarer than them all.
I'show no guests round rumps or loins from fatted flocks or herds,
But honourable members all eating their own words.
Of my repast the first course is absurdities and blunders,
And the second recantations and compulsory knock-unders:
On me SIR Robert bolted all he’d said unto the nation,
And made a meal of his own words about Emancipation;
And the Tapers, and the Tadpoles, who followed his example,
To make up for the nauseous meal, found the loaves and fishes ample.
On me grim GRAHAME's meal was spread, when (with him no rare
occurrence) he
Ate up both facts and figures out of his “Corn and Currency.”
And on me, the previous process of rumination o'er,
The world now sees him gulp again what he'd disgorged before.
I’ve had PALMERston before me, how oft’tis hard to say,
To swallow his own high-spiced words in the most unblushing way.
But of all the entertainments I’ve provided of the kind,
The one that’s just now coming off's the choicest to my mind:
When in solemn ring of gentlemen, adhesive to their places,
SIR Robert and the ministers o'er HANsand make wry faces,
And the Premier, forced to eat his words, adopts the bold"
course
Of washing down his humble pie with floods of his own sauce.

T H E S N O B S OF ENG LAN D.
BY ONE OF THEMSELVES.
PREFATORY REMARKS.
[The necessity of a work on Snobs, demonstrated from History, and proced
by felicitous illustrations:—I am the individual destined to write that work—
My cocation is announced in terms of great eloquence—I show that the world
has been gradually preparing itself for the work and the MAN–Snobs are to
be studied like other objects of Natural Science, and are a part of the Beau-
| tiful (with a large B).
Colonel Snobley.]
They percade all classes—Affecting instance of
E have all read a statement, (the
2 authenticity of which I take leave
to doubt entirely, for upon what
calculations I should like to know
is it founded ?)—we have all, I
say, been favoured by perusing a
remark, that when the times and
necessities of the world call for
a Man, that individual is found.
Thus at the French Revolution,
(which the reader will be pleased
to have introduced so early) when
it was requisite to administer a
corrective dose to the nation,
RoBEs PIERRE was found a most foul and naused us dose indeed, and
swallowed eagerly by the patient, greatly to the latter's ultimate
advantage : thus, when it became necessary to kick John BULL out
of America, MR. WASHINGTon stepped forward, and performed that
job to satisfaction : thus when the EARL of ALDBoRough was
unwell, PaoFEssoR HollowAY appeared with his pills, and cured
| his Lordship, as per advertisement, &c. &c. Numberless instances
might be adduced to show, that when a nation is in great want the
relief is at hand, just as in the Pantomime (that microcosm) where,
when Clown wants anything—a warming-pan, a pump-handle, a goose,
or a lady's tippet—a fellow comes sauntering out from behind the
side-scenes with the very article in question. And here I cannot
help observing how very queer and peculiar the condition of our
own beloved England and Ireland must be. One can fancy a great
people led by Moses, or liberated by WASHINGTon, or saved by
LEoNIDAs or ALFRED THE GREAT ; whereas the heroes destined
to relieve us at present, are a couple of notorious quacks, as SIR,
Rob ERT and MR. O'Conn ELL will bear me out in asserting. This
I throw out as a mere parenthetic observation, and revert to the
former argument, which anybody may admit or deny.
At any rate, men about to commence an undertaking don't deny it.
—Say it is a railroad : the directors begin by stating that “A more
intimate communication between Bathershins and Derrynane Beg
is necessary for the advancement of civilisation, and demanded by
the multitudinous acclamations of the great Irish people.” Or sup-
pose it is a newspaper : the prospectus states that “At a time when
the Church is in danger, threatened from without by savage fanati-
cism and miscreant unbelief, and undermined from within by danger-
ous Jesuitism and suicidal Schism, a Want has been universally felt
—a suffering people has looked abroad—for an Ecclesiastical Cham-
pion and Guardian. A body of Prelates and Gentlemen have there-
fore stepped forward in this our hour of danger, and determined on
establishing THE BEADLE newspaper,” &c., &c. But one or other of
these points at least is incontrovertible. The public wants a thing,
therefore it is supplied with it, or the public is supplied with a
thing; therefore it wants it.
I have long gone about with a conviction in my mind that I had a
work to do—a Work, if you like, with a great W.; a Purpose to
fulfil ; a chasm to leap into, like CURTIUs, horse & foot; a Great
Social Evil to Discover and to Remedy. That Conviction Has Pur-
sued me for Years. It has Dogged me in the Busy Street; Seated
Itself. By Me in The Lonely Study; Jogged My Eibow as it Lifted
| The Wine-cup at The Festive Board ; Pursued me through the
Maze of Rotten Row; Followed me in Far Lands, on Brighton's
Shingly Beach, or Margate's Sand. The Voice Outpiped the
Roaring of the Sea; it Nestles in my Nightcap, And It Whispers,
“Wake, Slumberer, thy Work Is Not Yet Done.” Last Year, By
Moonlight, in the Colosseum, the Little Sedulous Voice Came To Me
And Said, “SMITH, or Jon Es,” (The Writer’s Name is Neither
Here Nor There) “SMITH, or Jones, my fine fellow, this is all very
well; but you ought to be at home writing your great work on
SNoBs.”
When a man has this sort of vocation it is all nonsense attempting
to elude it. He must speak out to the nations ; he must unbusm
himself, as JEAMEs would say, or choke and die. “Mark to yourself.”
I have often mentally exclaimed to your humble servant, “the
gradual way in which you have been prepared for, and are now led
by an irresistible necessity to enter upon your great labour. First
the World was made : then, as a matter of course, Snobs; they
existed for years and years, and were no more known than America.
But presently, ingens patebat tellus, -the people became darkly
aware that there was such a race. Not above five-and-twenty years
since, a name, an expressive monosyllable arose to designate that
race. That name has spread over England like railroads subse-
quently; Snobs are known and recognised throughout an Empire
on which I am given to understand the Sun never sets. Punch
appears at the ripe season, to chronicle their history; and THE
INDIvidual comes forth to write that history in Punch.
I have, (and for this gift I congratulate myself with a Deep and
Abiding Thankfulness) an eye for a Snob. If the Truthful is the
Beautiful : it is Beautiful to study even the Snobbish : to track
Snobs through history, as certain little dogs in Hampshire hunt out
truffles : to sink shafts in society and come upon rich veins of Snob-
ore. Snobbishness is like Death in a quotation from Horace, which
I hope you never have heard, “beating with equal foot at poor men's
doors, and kicking at the gates of Emperors.” It is a great mistake
to judge of Snobs lightly, and think they exist among the lower
classes merely. An immense per centage of Snobs I believe is to be
found in every rank of this mortal life. You must not judge hastily
or vulgarly of Snobs : to do so shows that you are yourself a Snob.
I myself have been taken for one.
When I was taking the waters at Bagnigge Wells, and living at
the Imperial Hotel there, there used to sit opposite me at breakfast,
for a short time, a Snob so insufferable that I felt I should never get
any benefit of the waters so long as he remained. His name was
LIEUTENANT Colon El SNoBLEY, of a certain dragoon regiment.
He wore japamned boots and moustachics: he lisped, drawled, and
left the “r's" out of his words: he was always flourishing about, and
smoothing his lacquered whiskers with a huge flaming bandanna,
that filled the room with an odour of musk so stifling that I deter-
mined to do battle with that Snob, and that either he or I should
quit the Inn. I first began harmless conversations with him;
frightening him exceedingly, for he did not know what to do when
so attacked, and had never the slightest notion that anybody would
take such a liberty with him as to speak first : then I handed him
the paper: then, as he would take no notice of these advances, I
used to look him in the face steadily and—and use my fork in the
light of a toothpick. After two mornings of this practice, he could
bear it no longer, and fairly quitted the place.
* Should the Colonel see this, will he remember the Gent. who asked
him if he thought PUBLIcoALER was a fine writer, and drove him
from the Hotel with a four-pronged fork?

THE NEWLY INVENTED ARTILLERY SPONGE. AN ACTIVE OFFICER.

It speaks volumes as to the disturbed state of the metro-
polis, when R. D.— thinks it necesary to issue cards stating
his profession of Police Constable, and making the public
acquainted with his private residence. Such a card ought to
be over the chimneypiece of every family that is liable to do-
mestic squabbles; so that, in the event of a row, R. D.—,
the Police Constable, could be immediately run for by one of
the parties who did not happen to be implicated in the “scrim-
mage.” We wonder that this active officer did not add to his
card a few of the usual intimations to be found in similar in-
struments. He might have appended a line to the effect that
“evening rows are punctually attended,” and “disturbances
quelled on the shortest notice.” At friendly societies, and other
social reunions, particularly at philanthropic meetings, a police-
man to preserve harmony would be a most important acqui-
sition.
As it appears that there is only one gunner in the Artillery to every 250 guns,
it has become very desirable that if the guns are to be cleaned, some process should
be discovered for doing so. By the apparatus shown in the accompanying engrav-
ing, several pieces can be sponged out at the same time, instead of allowing the
poor, unfortunate guns to feel themselves so neglected that they turn rusty, or
burst their sides eventually at the absurdity of their own position. As economy
has been the order of the day in all the arrangements made for the defence of Eng.
land, a proposition such as that we have made must meet with the approbation of
the Board of Ordnance.
FREE TRADE ANTICIPATIONS OF THE FAIR.
HILst the moody farm-
ers are glumly gaz-
ing into the dark
gloom which lowers
on the agricultural
horizon, we are
23 ashamed to say that
- º their wives and
`-- daughters, with the
characteristic indif-
ference of their sex
to politics, and with
a vision habitually
bounded by their
looking-glasses, are
now exulting in flat-
tering dreams, sug-
ested by the Free
rade Measures of
SIR. Robert PEEL.
Their heads, full of
Valenciennes lace,
are already, in imagi-
nation, bedecked with
caps of that material;
as are their shoulders
with Cardinals, and
things of that des-
cription. Already Fancy invests the hand which is, or ought to be,
wielding the roller, spreading the jam, or mixing the syllabub, if not
milking the cow, in the glove of Paris kid. .
The damsel who is supposed to be trudging to market, or treading the
dairy on the foot supported by the British patten, is trying to think how
that foot will look in a French shoe; not only not considering how it will
be possible for her to put her foot in it, but how the nation will put its
foot in it in another sense, and how soon that nation, no less than herself,
will find out where the shoe pinches. Perhaps, too, she is depicting to
herself the swain of her heart exchanging his smock frock for a blouse,
and appropriately, of course, cherishing a beard and a pair of huge
mustaches.
We have always thought highly of the wives and daughters of Eng-
land; but we are shocked at this want of sympathy with their parents
and husbands, and this disregard of domestic ties in comparison with
bows of ribbon. We lament to find them thinking of what colours they
shall wear, when those husbands and those parents are nailing their own
to the mast.
We are sorry to see them manifest so little excitement, or rather, so
much excitement of the wrong sort, whilst the British Lion is roar-
ing with indignation, and lashing in fury his mane with his magnani-
mous tail.

of various gentlemen of the Church may be duly commemorated.
“MADAME Tussaud proposes to call this apartment the “Clerical
Corner.” In it will be found the most distinguished clergymen of modern
times: reverend gentlemen who have become matters of history, refer-
ence, and precedent to all lawyers. Thus, the REVEREND MR. Joshua
DAY will be placed in the nook with the identical knife with which—on a
well-known occasion—he maimed and mangled certain sheep. The Rev.
MR. CREsswell will also have a place with others of the cloth, too nume-
rous to be admitted within the limits of an advertisement.
“MADAME Tussaud, however, begs leave to call the attention of the
public to her figure of the Rev. MR. ARDEN, as the last pulpit curiosity
of the kind. Careless of expense, she has purchased of the Reverend
Gentleman the identical shirt which he wore “over his clothes" in his
harmless night frolics with the EARL of FERRERs. She has also the exact
representation of his reverend face, as it appeared with the moustachios
corked upon it by the aforesaid distinguished nobleman.

A CANDID ADMISSION.
IT is said that a black crow thinks all its little ones white, or in other
words, that the parents of ugly children are in the habit of considering
the ordinary little darlings as something unusually beautiful. It is there-
fore refreshing to get a piece of parental candour like that contained in
the following advertisement.
Lodgings WANTED; PARLoua and BED-Room, with small plain family,
&c., &c.
This acknowledgment of the plainness of the family, proves that there
is no parental prejudice in this instance. The family is advertised as
plain, and of course it is implicitly admitted that the person letting them
lodgings would find them very ugly customers.

a charming apartment, cut off from the public room—in which are taste- |
fully grouped together bloodshed and homicide in every variety,+she has

EPPING is remarkableſfor its sausages—which by-the-bye all come
down from London by the earrier, and come back again by the coach.
Windsor is illustrious for its soap, which is all made in the Strand.
Epsom stands on a proud pre-eminence for its salts, which are manufac-
tured wholesale in Bouverie Street. Romford is famous for its stoves, not
one of which was ever made at Romford. Westphalia is peculiar for its
hams, which are the legs of British pigsrrhbbed over withaal blacking
brush to get the true Westphalian complexion. But Chelsea is no impos-
tor, for the Chelsea Buns are actually made on the spot from which
they take their title. It is sufficient to say how the Bun first became
identified with this popular suburb.
Bath claims also the credit of giving a Bun to the world, but we believe
that the Bath Bun-son the principle of no man being a prophet in his own
country—is by no meansppopular in the city from which it derives its
name. Perhaps, also; the greater popularity of the Bath Brick may have
snuffed out the glory of the Bath Bun, for two suns, it is well known, can-
not shine in thes sameahemisphere. Farnotherwise is it with Chelsea,
where, in consequence of the dearth of cakes—excepting of course the inha-
*- the Bun is a thing per se, and remains the lion of the neighbour-
As no one thinks of quitting Milan without-seeing the duomo, Egypt
without visiting the Pyramids, or London without making a pilgrimage to
the Punch Office—so no one thinks of leaving Chelsea without going on
an expedition to the “Old Original Bun House.” Formerly there were
two Buan Houses, both laying claim to be the “Old Original,” like those
two HARRIEs from America-one SMITH and the other Russell—each
of whom insists that he is the original Woodman who spared the tree,
and the genuine Maniac. Thus it was with the two Original Chelsea
Bun Houses in the olden time, and our sketch presents a view of that
which still purports to be the Original. It lies a good deal inland, and
the traveller by omnibus must take a guide from the Goat and Boots,
who will lead him in safety to the object of his curiosity. Over the por-
tico is a classical figure, supposed to be Julius Cæsar, who having
arrived with an enormous appetite (for conquest) seized a Chelsea Bun
in order to satisfy his appetite in the speediest manner possible.
We regret to say that the palmy days of Chelsea Buns are gone by, but
the Bun House still remains. There is the shell, but where t oh where
is the oyster? The Chelsea Bun is like the Corporation and Test Acts,
or any other exploded fallacy. Our grandfathers ate it, but we neglect it.
Like a Sally-Lunn Tea-Cake, it belongs to the memories of the past. to make us pause.
We could philosophise over a Chelsea Bun as Hamlet did over the skull
of Yorick, but as MR. Ainsworth said when he had made arrangements
for smashing SHAkspeaRE, “We haven't time.”
THE NEW TIMON, AND THE POETs.
WE know him, out of ShakspeaRE's art,
And those fine curses which he spoke;
The old TIMON, with his noble heart,
That, strongly loathing, greatly broke.
So died the Old : here comes the New.
* Regard him : a familiar face :
I thought we knew him : What, it's you,
The padded man—that wears the stays-
Who kill'd the girls and thrill'd the boys,
With dandy pathos when you wrote,
A Lion, you, that made a noise,
And shook a mane en papillotes.
| And once you tried the Muses too;
You fail'd, Sir: therefore now you turn,
You fall on those who are to you,
As Captain is to Subaltern.
But men of long-enduring hopes,
And careless what this hour may bring,
Can pardon little would-be Popes
And BRUMMELs, when they try to sting.
An artist, Sir, should rest in Art,
And waive a little of his claim ;
To have the deep Poetic heart
Is more than all poetic fame.
But you, Sir, you are hard to please;
You never look but half content :
Nor like a gentleman at ease,
With moral breadth of temperament.
And what with spites and what with fears,
You cannot let a body be:
It's always ringing in your ears,
“They call this man as good as me.”
What profits now to understand
The merits of a spotless shirt—
A dapper boot—a little hand—
If half the little soul is dirt :
You talk of tinsel ! why we see
The old mark of rouge upon your cheeks.
You prate of Nature | you are he
That spilt his life about the cliques.
A TIMON you ! Nay, nay, for shame :
It looks too arrogant a jest-

You bandbox. Off, and let him rest.

A MONSTER PROTECTIONIST.
In our days everything that is great, colossal, astounding, is a monster
—and therefore is LoRD WILLIAM LENNox a Monster Protectionist. We
have the fact written down by his own pen—his own magpie quill.
He wrote a letter, giving his vote to GENERAL Evans. The letter, as it
appeared in the papers, was cruelly mangled; we, however, supply in
italics what was unaccountably suppressed.
“1, Berkley Square, London, Feb. 16, 1846.
“Sir-In reply to your circular, I beg to say I am a strong Protectionist in favour of
domestic industry, [in evidence of which, Sir, I beg to refer you to my novel of the “Tuft
Hunter,’ in which you will perceive how I protected—making them quite my own—whole
pages of “The Antiquary' and “Tylney Hall,” the result of the “domestic industry’ of
Sir Walter Scott ...] Tom Hood]; but as the choice now lies between two free-traders, I
cannot for a moment hesitate to give my vote to the open, honest, consistent supporter
of those sentiments, GENERAL Evans, in preference to CAPTAIN Rous, who, at the
last general election, repudiated the very principles which he now comes forward so
earnestly to maintain.
“I have the honour to remain,
“Your obedient servant,

This letter would be only of the value of a spoilt sheet of paper did it
emanate from a man of no landed property; but when we recollect the
“stake” that Load LENNox has in the country, the epistle is a document

wishes, and—no, she could not bring
herself to do it. Besides, she averred,
BIB was a very clever person ; he had
read somany things; there was nothing
he did not know something of ; and
—there could be no doubt of it—dear
Edward must be right.
“And this blessed creature is to
scream itself to death ! SARAH, you're
getting as great a fool as your husband.
Talking about Nature having its
course ! You've learnt that gibberish
from him 1 A pretty pickle Nature
would bein, if we let it have its own way.
No ; I've had nine of you : but in my
time people never talked nonsense
about Nature. It's only a new-fangled
word that's come up—that people use
to excuse their tricks with. He talked
about Nature when he wanted Baby
not to wear a cap—as if it was born
like a Hottentot, covered with wool.
Not to wear a cap ! Yes—and he
called it Nature ' Now, SARAH, I
wouldn't find fault with your dear hus-
band for the world. But it wasn't
Nature, my love—no ; it was mean-
ness. Ha! you don't know yet what
men are. Yes, meanness : for he only
wanted to save his money, and not to
buy the lace.”
“Oh, mother
cried MRs. BIB.
“Ha! my dear,” said Mrs. DAFFY,
with a compassionating smile, “you're
a young creature, and so believe any-
thing your husband tells you. It was
the same with me when I first married your father. I soon learnt
better, SARAH. Nothing but meanness, my dear. You heard, too,
what he said about a coral and bells | His child, he said, should have
no such trumpery. Nothing like a good hard crust of bread—he said
—to bring through the teeth. Of course ; a crust’s cheap enough—
a coral costs money. That's just like the men, SARAH ; and so you’ll
find it.”
“Not with Edward, I’m sure,” said the nice little wife.
best creature in all the world.”
“Of course. It's right to think so—it's your duty, my dear, to
think so. Nevertheless, you'll see he's just like the rest of 'em. Oh
where is Becky"—and again MRs. DAFFY rang the bell—“for this
aniseed "
“No, mother ; it shan’t be. I never disobeyed Edward's will yet”—
“Well, my dear"—and MRs. DAFFY laughed heartily at the thought
—“you're sure to do it some day—don't tell me, it isn't to be
expected that you shouldn't—and now, when your dear child's suf-
fering, is the best time to begin. I’m sure its cries would pierce a
stone. And how can a little aniseed hurt it 2 ”
“But Edward always said it never should be drugged,” observed
MRs. BIB, evidently giving way.
“Who wants to drug it 2 You don't call aniseed a drug, do you ?
And only half a drop—just as much as would fill the eye of a needle.
You always took it—and how can it hurt your child "
Silently, yet sorrowfully, did MRs. BIB hear her mother give
Becky the fatal order. BECKY—well acquainted with the ignorant
whims, as she contemptuously considered them, of her master—looked
appealingly at her mistress ; and in a moment took her silence for
assent. With considerable alacrity did Becky hasten for the cordial.
Most pleasing to her was the errand ; for it was to circumvent and
confound the nonsense of one of the sex that never did, and never
How can you ?”

“He’s the
could know anything about babies. It was practically to rebuke the
ignorance and presumption of man.
The aniseed was bought. MRs. DAFFY, with considerable presence
of mind, poured the liquor into a spoon, proving, by the quantity, her
gigantic notions of the eye of a needle. Very curious—very interest-
ing—was it to consider the various expression of that family groups.
No DoNNA Tof ANA, no BRINVILLIERs – not even ANNA MARIA
ZwanzIGER — not one of these sweet poisoners did or could
administer the mortal dram that was to send the drinker to sleep in
his coffin—not one of these bold, white-handed women, we say, could
show a finer sample of serenity than MRs. DAFFY, with the child
roaring in her lap, and the brimming spoon held firmly in her hand.
There was a calmness in her face, sweetened by a look of conscious
benevolence : it was plain she felt that she was about to do Baby a
world of good, and at the same time to triumph over Baby's father.
It was a double pleasure. Anxious—more than anxious—was the
face of MRs. BIB. Does the reader remember Michael ANGELo's
Eve, with her hand among the apples 2 She cannot but pluck the
fruit. Yet in her face, throughout her form, there seems to creep a
shuddering sense of the after evil of the inevitable act. It is as if
at the very moment the wings of the Angel of Death shadow her
paradisaical brightness. Something after this—a sort of prose version
of it—looked MRs. BIB. Can we wonder at it 2 For, considering
MRs. BIB—whose heart was grown into BIB's heart, both were so
tightly hooped about by that little round of marriage metal which
gives the legal “hall mark” to love—Mrs. BIB, we say, felt that for
the first time she was committing disobedience to the behests of her
natural and amen-made lord. The first disobedience It is a truth,
ladies—a truth as truthful as the connubial manacle. Happy couple,
MR. and MRs. BIB They were proud, delighted with their chains.
And is it not a charming sight—a touching matter to think of—to see
Married Love, like the thief in the Beggar's Opera, dancing to the
music of his own fetters ?
One twelvemonth had MRs. BIB been married, and it was her first
disobedience. It must be confessed, as was afterwards said of Baby
BIB's running alone, she took to it very late. The first disobedience 1
And who shall reveal the emotion—what moral line and lead shall
fathom the depths of that woman's soul, as she felt that there—stand-
ing upon her own hearth, a hearth endeared to her by many teas and
toasts—she was coolly, calmly, deliberately, and with malice afore-
thought, breaking her marriage vow 2 Or if not breaking it, certainly
cracking it 2
We fear that this domestic wickedness, this treason—
for which, by the defect of our laws, there is no hurdle—is done every
day. But shall its familiarity reconcile us to its terrible iniquity ?
Assuredly no. And MRs. BIB felt the awfulness of that moment.
As her marriage-vow was flawed—(it went off with a short tick, like a
cold glass receiving hot water)—she saw the church wherein she gave
her virgin hand to BIB. The words, “love, honour, and obey,”
pealed upon her remorseful soul with a solemn organ swell. She saw
her own little hand shaking in the hand of BIB. She saw the round
face—streaked like a streaked tulip—of the Vulcanic clergyman,
welding two hearts together. In that brief moment—yes, again she
saw everything. She saw her own weeping face reflected in the double-
gilt buttons of BIB. She saw her dear mother letting fall a heavy
shower of tears upon a very large nosegay; she saw the pug-nose of
her bridesmaid JEMIMA–(one of those charming, almost eatable pugs ;
dear little knobs, especially made for men to hang their hearts, like
hats upon)—she saw her, looking a little misty, yet looking as though
she wondered when her turn would come. All these recollections—
and many more, too numerous for this page—fell smitingly upon the
soul of MRs. BIB in that sad, rebellious moment. However, so callous
does the conjugal mind become, that, in after years, MRs. BIB every
day committed the same sort of treason, and, in her own bravado
words, thought nothing of it. Women, be warned
We must finish our painting of the group. BECRY, the maid—half
grinningly, half anxiously looked, now at the spoonful of aniseed—
and now at the door. Master might come.
It is done. Baby has swallowed the intemperate juice ; the subtle
prologue to who shall say how much after brandy-and-water 2
And the household gods squeak like mice in the waistcoat at the
disobedience of MRs. BIB. And BIB himself—whilst this treason is
acting, where is he 7 Unconscious man he is doing business in the
City, to stock his cupboard at home.
Baby turns blue. Baby clenches its fists. MRs. BIB thinks Baby
is dying. MRs. DAFFY turns Baby round upon its belly, and pats its
back. And whilst employed in this domestic operation, she serenely
says to her daughter—“SARAH, my dear, when BIB comes home, don't
let him kiss the child, else he'll smell it.”

And strain to make an inch of room

THE SCHOOLMASTER IN REGIMENTALs 1
SIR CHARLEs NAPIER, of the Indian army, is, it is allowed, “as
brave as his sword.” But his courage cannot, we think, exceed his
eloquence. His address to the troops in garrison, as printed in the
Kurrachee Adrertiser of December 31, is quite a companion-speech to the
oration of Napoleon, in which his troops were requested to particularly
remember that “forty centuries were looking down upon them from the
Pyramids;” one of those very fine things that the world has consented
to receive as fine, without troubling itself to analyse their meaning.
Wherefore the French troops should be inspired by the ghost of the
legendary Cheors, and the ghosts succeeding him, is a part of the vast
ignorance we shall carry to the grave. But to return to the Indian
Napien-to consider the affectionate terms in which he addresses his
children of the sabre, lance, and bayonet. He shows himself quite a
schoolmaster of glory, and when in wrath wields the laurel bough as
though it were the birch. He starts with a declaration that in “the

carry fire and slaughter all over the earth, but if any petty, ped-
|dling, sneak-up scoundrel of a private soldier, putting aside his con-
science, should be found with a prigged turkey or a stolen goose, why
—assure as my name is ALExANDER—that atrocious villain shall have
Thus on a
certain occasion spoke ALExANDER, whereupon the just gods—
though Plutarch says nothing of the matter—“laughed consum-
edly.” But we must leave ALExANDER THE GREAT for CHARLEs THE
TERRIBLE. With a tremendous burst of indignation against the small
robbers that infest even the most moral of armies, he cries:—
| “where you see one of these rufians disgracing the cloth, seize him by the neck, and
- bring him to your officer at once.”
When the varlets are taken, then they shall see what they shallsee:
**I have got two, and there are four more; I know them, and here tell them. I will
have them yet, and when I get them they shall hang on the nearest tree 1 come to, and
if no tree is insight I will shoot them on the spot—ay, if need be, even with my own hand."
The high rank of the executioner would, no doubt, mightily sweeten
the fate of the executed.
This address, however, should be well considered by those persons
about to enlist. They should thereupon commune with themselves;
they should make an inward inquiry, whether they are fit to become
units of a “glorious, honourable, good, and moral army.” (The mora-
lity of recruiting-serjeants is, by the way, proverbial.) They must
search their souls; and finding the slightest flaw—the smallest speck
—in their divine parts, they must immediately believe themselves un-
worthy of pipeclay : and instead of becoming good, moral, and reli-
gious consumers of bullets and gunpowder, they must be content to
dig the soil, or to work at any handicraft. In future, the recruiting-
serjeants ought to wear ribands of unmixed virgin-white; significant
that none but the very purest will be thought worthy of the man-
purchasing shilling.
THE BATTLE OF THE DRAWING-ROOM.
Considen ABLE consternation was excited at the NELson Column on
Thursday the 28th of February, by an attempted invasion of St. James's
Park. A desperate gang of barbarians, carrying wooden benches, had
collected in large numbers for the purpose of entering the Park, plant-
ing their forms along the road, and remaining as squatters while the
carriages were passing with the company to and from HER MAJESTY's
Drawing-room. Fortunately, a strong body of police happened to be
in attendance at the Column, and resisted the efforts of the invaders.
At one time K-25 had his flank turned by an approach of the foe, with
their benches, full charge; but by the bravery of Private Jones, of
the 3rd Foot Guards, who happened to be on duty, the invaders were
repulsed, after having been severely routed with the butt-end of the
charge of the fortress beneath the Column were seized, at the very
outset of the engagement, with a panic, which kept them
skulking behind the base of the structure from the begin-
ning to the end of the battle. Nothing could exceed the
gallantry of Private Jones, who executed his different
manoeuvres with a mixture of good humour and firmness
that was truly laudable. K25 seemed to carryout the orders
of his superiors in sorrow rather than in anger, and the
man of the world seemed to be struggling with the police-
man under the cape which covered his bosom. The enemy
ultimately retired across the road with their benches, and
having sat down upon them for a short time, firing a few
verbal squibs at the soldiery, made a precipitate retreat
towards Storey's Gate. Here another unsuccessful attempt was made
to force the Park lines, which having entirely failed, they repaired tº
musket. We regret to say that the local Guards entrusted with the lº
their respective fastnesses.

PROTECTION AND NATIVE PROD UCIE.
that
the subject, we have made arrangements
for presenting our readers with a Royal
Doll's Court Circular, of which we furnish a
specimen:-
“The Royal Doll was taken her accus-
tomed airing in her go-cart, drawn by a
superb pair of calves, bred by John the
royal footman. The Royal Doll attended in
the schoolroom for an hour, and reposed
in a drawer with her head downwards
during the time devoted to study.
“The Royal Doll left the drawer at exactly
twelve, and was danced for a quarter of an
hour on the rug before the fire, where she
sustained some inconvenience from the heat,
and has looked considerably paler ever since
period. The Royal Doll had her eyes
exercised with the wire in the usual way
| yesterday morning. The Royal Doll had
an airing, by being left-in-the garden of
|Buckingham Palace-all nighton Wednes-
day last. Her dress was somewhat deranged
by the moisture, but having had her toilette
changed, she speedily recovered.”
THE theory of protection for native produce is an very well, but the practice would, we fear;
AN ALARMING REPORT.
Coxsiderable-consternation was excited
a few nights ago-by-a-succession of loud
renorts, whi rd all over-the-me-
be somewhat ridiculous. We might raise a shout of protection for the native sloe-leaf, and insistºtropolis, just about the hour-when quiet
on the prohibition of tea, while the exclusion of the mild Havannah and the penny-Cuba.
be demanded by those enthusiasts who would ask protection for the British lettuce and the cab-
bage leaves of happy Albion. But if we extend the principle of protection still further, if we
carry it to its legitimate end, or, in other words, carry it to the clothes, we should have ward-
robes consisting only of such articles as might be grownin our own country. The sheep-skin would
take the place of the eight-and-twopenny registered Paletot, and the hayband would become the
substitute for the trowser. Such a set of fashions as would be the result of the prohibition of
foreign articles can only be conceived by the imagination of the artist, and to him, therefore, we
leave the task of depicting them.
Qſhe 330pal Toll's Court Circular."
It has been already announced in the papers that the PRINcess Royal has received a present
of a doll, with a complete wardrobe, from Louis-Philippe. The completeness of the wardrobe of
course admits of the various processes of dressing—for the promenade, for dinner, or for an
evening party or ball, to be carried out with reference to the doll of royalty, which is subjected
to all the strictest rules of court etiquette and fashion. Feeling the importance and interest of
and industrious people were seeking their
nocturnal repose. Children whº are teeth-
ing, of whom it is calculated there are nearly
seven thousand—got off to sleep-with
culty every night—in the metropolis, were all
suddenly woke up by a series of bangs such
as have not been heard-for-a- -
derable period. It is estimated that at least
three dozen of “Godfrey” and two dozen of
“Mrs. Johnson” were consumed in the half
hour, during which the successive explosions
were heard on the night alluded to. At
the lowest computation, three thousand
fathers had-to-turn out of bed to nurse
seven thousand children, allowing two chil-
dren and a half to each father, and four
fathers to every seven families.
All sorts of speculations were indulged in
as to the cause or meaning of the series of
reports. Some thought it was DR. DEE's
overdue earthquake, which was payable
by DEE on public credulity, and those fami-
lies who expected the earthquake were
making arrangements-to-get up imme-
diately, and repair in cabs to some sheltered
suburb.
Others thought the reports might proceed
from the Park and the Tower, and that they
were possibly intended to announce one of
those events which are so frequently adding
to the happiness of the nation-in general,
and the domestic circle of royalty in par-
ticular. It was not until the following day
it became generally known, that the sounds
proceeded from the firing of guns in celebra-
tion of the frightful slaughter that has re-
cently taken place in India, and which we
are told is a matter for general rejoicing.
We confess we have not yet been able to
get up any high degree of hilarity after
reading the accounts in the newspapers.
A Query.
CHILDE HARold, speaking of the Church
of St. Peter's, Rome, says:-
“But lo! the dome, the vast, the wondrous dome!
To which Diana's marvel was a cell."
Which is the more deserving of the term-
the “Ephesian's miracle,”0r the Exhibition
of St. Paul’s a
some time back, according to the bill drawn.

Owing To the Mildness of The SEAson, the Militia MAN looks up his Ducks.
T EI E LATE FIL E E T P R IS ON.
His venerable institution—one of the many evidences
of the wisdom of our ancestors—is fast vanishing.
The ruthless hand of reform is casting brick from
brick of the time-hallowed edifice, and in a few
days we may say of the Fleet what was long since
said of Troy—Fuit/
However, not wholly unmourned does the fabric
disappear. We own it; our pen weeps ink, confess-
ing it, that we have fallen upon a money-changing,
utilitarian age ; nevertheless, it is an age not
wholly unredeemed by some lovers of the ancient
and the picturesque ; for, at the late sale of the
materials of the Fleet, Punch was happy to see the
old familiar faces of various sharp attorneys,
levitical and others, with the well-known counte-
nances of distinguished officers of the Sheriff.
They all attended—we were delighted with the
knowledge of the pleasing fact—to secure for
themselves various articles and fragments of a
building endeared to them by so many ties, and
associated with so many bygone years of happiness
and profit. Several of the late turnkeys (in very
decent mourning) were upon the ground, and exci-
ted considerable interest as living relics of the past.
Messrs. PULLEN & SoN were the gifted auctioneers employed on the melancholy occasion.
The gentleman who wielded the hammer was evidently elevated by the subject. He felt
that “the eyes of all Israel were upon him,” and did his best. He commenced his address
by stating that the materials which he had the honour to offer to an enlightened Public
were associated with the social history of England. Men of the highest and profoundest
genius—men very dear, indeed, to their fellow-Englishmen—had, from time to time, dwelt
in the Fleet, making every brick of it truly classic. He would not weary the attention of
his auditors, otherwise he could tell them how many had not only lived there—but died
there, and all to prove to surrounding nations that the English Constitution gave freedom
to every man—though there had been some people so obstinately constituted as to refuse
to accept it. However, the levelling spirit of the times had doomed the Fleet ; that ancient
fabric was to be swept away. He (the auctioneer) was not an alarmist—certainly not. But
he must say this much : He had always looked upon the stones of the Fleet Prison as the
brightest gems in the British crown. He only hoped that revolutionists would know where to
stop ; and with this patriotic aspiration, the man
of the hammer proceeded to knock down right
and left. We can only give one or two of the lots,
and purchasers.
Lot 1.-The tin-box which the prisoners used
to rattle whilst crying, “Please to remember the
poor debtors,” was very fiercely contested. It
was ultimately knocked down at ten shillings to
a distinguished attorney of Cursitor Street, who
purposed to use it as a family tea-caddy.
Lot 2.-The bolt and lock of the outer gate of
the Fleet. Bought by MR. LAzARUs MACNAB,
Sheriff's Officer, of Fetter Lane, for the garden-
gate of his villa at Hackney.
Ten thousand bricks were purchased by the
celebrated novelist, MR. AINsworth ; that gen-
tleman being about to add Fleet Prison to his
Old St. Paul's, and other public buildings ; and
being desirous—to give the weight of truthful-
ness to his book—to employ the original bricks
in the composition of his three volumes.

'THE SNOBS OF ENGLAND.
BY ONE OF THEMSELVES.
CHAPTER I.--THE SNOB SOCIALLY CONSIDERED.
THERE are relative and positive Snobs.
I mean by positive, such persons as
are Snobs everywhere, in all com-
panies, from morning till night, from
youth to the grave, being by Nature
endowed with Snobbishness—and
others who are Snobs only in certain
circumstances and relations of life.
For instance: I once knew a man
who committed before me an act as
atrocious as that which I have indi-
cated in the last chapter as per-
the using the fork in the guise of a
toothpick. I once, I say, knew a
man who, dining in my company at
the Europa coffee-house, (opposite
the Grand Opera, and, as everybody
knows, the only decent place for dining at Naples,) ate peas with the
assistance of his knife. He was a person with whose society I was
greatly pleased at first—indeed, we had met in the crater of Mount
Vesuvius, and were subsequently robbed and held to ransom by bri-
gands in Calabria, which is nothing to the purpose—a man of great
powers, excellent heart, and varied information ; but I had never
before seen him with a dish of peas, and his conduct in regard to them
caused me the deepest pain.
After having seen him thus publicly comport himself, but one
course was open to me—to cut his acquaintance. I commissioned a
mutual friend (the HoNour ABLE Poly ANTHUs) to break the matter
to this gentleman as delicately as possible, and to say that painful cir-
cumstances—in no wise affecting MR. MARRowfat's honour, or my
esteem for him—had occurred, which obliged me to forego my intimacy
with him ; and accordingly we met, and gave each other the cut direct
that night at the DUCHEss of MonTE FIAsco's ball.
Everybody at Naples remarked the separation of the DAMoN and
PYTHIAs—indeed, MARRow FAT had saved my life more than once—but,
as an English gentleman, what was I to do 2
My dear friend was, in this instance, the Snob relatire. It is not
snobbish of persons of rank of any other nation to employ their knife
in the manner alluded to. I have seen MoRTE FIAsco clean his
trencher with his knife, and every Principe in company doing like-
wise. I have seen, at the hospitable board of H. I. H. the GRAND
DUCHEss STEPHANIE of BADEN-(who, if these humble lines should
come under her Imperial eyes, is besought to remember graciously the
most devoted of her servants)—I have seen, I say, the Hereditary
Princess of Potztausend-Donnerwetter (that serenely-beautiful woman!)
use her knife in lieu of a fork or spoon ; I have seen her almost swal-
low it, by Jove' like RAMo SAMEE, the Indian juggler. And did I
blench * Did my estimation for the Princess diminish 2 No, lovely
AMALIA 1 One of the truest passions that ever was inspired by
woman was raised in this bosom by that lady. Beautiful one long,
long may the knife carry food to those lips : the reddest and loveliest
in the world !
The cause of my quarrel with MARRow FAT I never breathed to mor-
tal soul for four years. We met in the halls of the aristocracy—our
friends and relatives. We jostled each other in the dance or at the
board ; but the estrangement continued, and seemed irrevocable, until
the fourth of June, last year.
We met at SIR GEoRGE GoLLoPER's. We were placed, he on te
right, your humble servant on the left of the adi.irable LADY G.
Peas formed part of the banquet—ducks and green peas. I trembled
as I saw MARRow FAT helped, and turned away sickening, lest I should
behold the weapon darting down his horrid jaws.
What was my astonishment, what my delight when I saw him use
his fork like any other Christian He did not administer the cold

where they cultivated peas, and only used two-pronged forks, and it
was only by living on the continent, where the usage of the four-prong
is general, that he lost the horrible custom.
In this point—and in this only—I confess myself a member of the
SILVER Fork School, and if this tale induce but one reader of Punch
to pause, to examine in his own mind solemnly, and ask, “Do I or do
I not eat peas with a knife 2"—to see the ruin which may fall upon
himself by continuing the practice, or his family by-beholding the
|example, these lines will not have been written in vain. And now,
whatever other authors may be who contribute to this miscellany, I

| IIlan.
By the way, as some readers are dull of comprehension, I may as
well say what the moral of this history is. The moralı is this —
Society having ordained certain customs, men are bound to cobey the
º, of society, and conform to its harmless orders.
If I should go to the British and Foreign Institute (and Heaven for-
bid I should go under any pretext or in any costume whatever)—if I
|ºld go to one of the tea-parties in a dressing gown-and-slippers,
and not in the usual attire of a gentleman, viz., pumps, a gold waist-
coat, a crush hat, assham frill, and a white choker—I should be
insulting society, and eating peas with my knife. Let the porters of the
Institute hustle out the individual who shall so offend. Such an
offender is, as regards society, a most emphatical and refractory SNoB.
It has its code and police as well as governments, and he mustecon-
form who would profit by the decrees set forth for the common
comfort.
I am naturally averse to egotism, and hate self-laudation con-
sumedly ; but I can't help relating here a circumstance illustrative of
the point in question, in which I must think I acted with considerable
prudence.
—the Russians were playing a double game, between ourselves, and
it became necessary on our part to employ an extra negotiator.
LECKERBIss PAs.IIA of Roumelia, then Chief Galeongee of the Porte,
gave a diplomatic banquet at his summer palace at Bujukdere. I
was on the left of the Galeongee ; and the Russian agent Count DE
DIDDLorF on his dexter side. DiDDLof F is a dandy who would die
of a rose in aromatic pain ; he had tried to have me, assassinated
three times in the course of the negotiation : but of course we were
friends in public, and saluted each other in the most cordial; and
charming manner.

dined with our fingers, and had flaps of bread for plates; the only
innovation he admitted was the use of European liquors, in which he
indulged with great gusto. He was an enormous eater. Amongst the
dishes a very large one was placed before him of a lamb dressed in
its wool, stuffed with prunes, garlic, assafoetida, capsicums, and other
condiments, the most abominable mixture that ever mortal smelt or
tasted. The Galeongee ate of this hugely ; and pursuing the Eastern
came to a particularly spicy morsel, would push it with his own hands
into his guests' very mouths.
I never shall forget the look of poor DIDDLoff, when his Excellency,

FATHER AND SON.
Scene FROM. An old comedy.
A REGULAR piece of comedy, of the Old School, has lately been enacted
by Lord LINCoLN and his father the DUKE of NEwcASTLE. The lat-
ter has appeared as a testy old man, a regular political Captain
Absolute, threatening to knock down that young jackanapes of a son of
his if he should run counter to the wishes of his kind and indulgent old
governor. The EARL OF LINcolN has been figuring as the light come-
dian of the political world, a dashing young scapegrace, following the
last new fashions, and, in fact, showing all that kind of spirit that is
generally met with in the modern farces, or those repositories of worn
out rubbish, the sterling, legitimate, five-act comedies of the early part
of the present century.
The scene, as lately acted, comes upon the public with all the fresh-
mess of a revival, but we cannot say that it has been a very successful
one. The choleric and impetuous style of the testy old man is quite
gone by in the present day, and there is no longer any fun to be found
in the mixture of obstinacy, stupidity, and violence which made up the
characters of the dramatic “fathers” of thirty years ago; when, if they
went fuming about, calling their sons rascals and making fools of
themselves, it was merely put down to the score of testiness. LoRD
LINcoLN has not been particularly happy as the dashing young fellow,
flying in opposition to his father's wishes.
In order to render the farce complete we ought to have had old
NEwcAstle relenting at the last moment, handing over Nottingham,
the object of his affection, to LINcoLN, and saying to him, “There,
there, you dog; go, and be happy.”
A few purses pitched about among the populace would have ren-
dered everything perfectly en régle for the fall of the curtain.
A Good speculation.
WE have to notice a gross oversight on the part of Ministers, the
more remarkable since they are converted to Free Trade principles.
One of the leading axioms of Free Trade is, that prices are created by
demand. Surely, the demand for the Stewardship of the Chiltern
Hundreds would create a good price for it : why do they not, then,
make it a saleable office 2

MILITARY FASHIONS.
WE have received the following letter from a female correspondent. We will reserve
our comments until the conclusion of the document:—
“Miss SERAPHINA ScLIGAL presents her compliments to Mister Punch, and has remarked
with much surprise the adoption of a certain article of female dress by the British soldiery.
The article in question cannot be intended for protection in the field, as Miss SERAPHINA
ScLIGAL is proud to say that the troops of her native land are not in the habit of turning
their backs upon the enemy. The appendage is certainly no ornament, for it is only cal-
culated to set off to advantage a very full skirt, and the great coats of the grenadiers
are remarkable for their excessive scantiness.
“That these appendages should be worn only on wet days materially adds to Miss SERA-
PHINA ScLIGAL's perplexity. If Mister Punch can give any explanation of the mystery,
he will confer a very great favour on Miss SERAPHINA ScLIGAL.”
Immediately on the receipt of this communication we called at the War Office, and
ascertained that the appendage which has so much excited our fair correspondent's curi-
osity consists of the cartridge-box, which is worn in wet weather underneath the coats of
the soldiers, that the damp may not reach the ammunition.
PUNCH*S POLITICAL DICTIONARY.
Estate. The title which a man has in his lands or property. Land is real estate,
and goods are personal estate ; so that the earth in the flower-pot is real property, but
the pot itself is a simple chattel. Suppose them both to descend at the same time, the
earth out of the flower-pot would come down upon my heir, but the pot would devolve
upon my executor.
Evide NCE. The legal means of getting at facts—or concealing them. There are
many general rules of evidence, but the chief art is required in dealing with adverse wit-
nesses, who must either be bullied or bothered, according to circumstances. When all
other resources have failed, it is safe, as a general rule, to ask a witness whether he has
ever compounded with his creditors. As he will probably become very indignant, and
lose his temper after this question, an important point has been gained, for the barrister
by keeping cool will have an advantage over the witness during the remainder of the exami-
nation.
Exchange, BILL of. A convenient mode of settling a debt of many pounds by the
outlay of a few shillings. The expression of a philosophic debtor, who exclaimed, “There !
thank Goodness, that's paid ' " was used on the occasion of his giving a Bill of Exchange
which he had not the smallest hope of taking up when it should happen to arrive at
maturity. It is said that exchange is no robbery, and, a fortiori, a Bill of Exchange
can be no robbery; therefore, in giving such an instrument, when it is really of no
value, some persons seem to think they are not robbing their creditors. So long as the
bill has the legal stamp, it cannot be said to have the stamp of fraud upon it. Bills of
Exchange are of very early origin, and it is clear
that the Greeks and Romans had a great many
bill transactions. In the time of JULIUS CAEsAR,
BRUTUs quarrelled with his friend CAssius because
he had been raising money improperly ; and very
likely on a bill, which he had got discounted by
what BRUTUs delicately calls an “indirection.”
It is thought by some that CAssius got his name
from continually going about among his friends,
exclaiming, “Cash us a Bill,” an hypothesis which
is much in favour, though admitting of a good deal
of controversy. His exclamation,
“I sent to you for gold to pay my legions,
Which you refused,”
proves that he had been wanting to borrow money,
and it is very likely that his “legions” were the
swarms of creditors by whom he was continually
pestered.
ExchEQUER, Court of. So called, according to
CAMDEN, because the table of the Court was covered
with a checkered cloth, upon which the king's
accounts were made up, by putting the money on
the different squares or chequers. This mode of
keeping accounts may have been very ingenious,
but we defy the most acute accountant of the
present day to discover the principle on which this
odd mode of bookkeeping was effected. We have
tried the experiment of using a draft board for the
records of our domestic expenditure, but the attempt
proved futile. We made every effort to square our
accounts, and get them into black and white, on the
black and white squares, but we ultimately aban-
doned the project as hopeless. Several officers of
the Exchequer were abolished by the 2nd & 3rd
William IV. c. 110, which gave the sack to the
bag-bearer, got rid of the clerk of the pipe, the
deputy clerk of the pipe, the comptroller of the
pipe, and deputy comptroller of the pipe, by putting
out all their pipes at one blow, and sent several
of the copyists to the right-about by leaving them
nothing to write about. The same act dispensed
with the Surveyor of the Green Wax, by giving
one of those legislative whacks at the abuses of
the law which have been used with such wholesome
effect within the last ten years. The Court of
Exchequer has much about the same jurisdiction
now as the other Courts, but it is presided over by
a chief baron and four puisne barons, none of
whom can have any retainers—which are the very
essence of baronial dignity.
SUNDAY TRADING IN SOLDIERS.
It is a wicked thing—according to the tender
Christianity of some folks—to deal on Sundays.
We must not deal in apples, or oranges,or lollipops,
or newspapers. Nevertheless, the Government,
among other things, permits Sabbath-trading in
soldiers. Recruiting serjeants may ply their trade
on-Sundays—angling for gudgeons on the seventh
day. This pleasing truth has been lately declared
by the Secretary of State, for we learn from the
Manchester Guardian that Mr. TRAFFORD, ºmagis-
trate of the New Bailey, refused to attest recruits
caught on Sundays; whereupon he received notice
from the Government minister, “to the effect that
the law officers of the Crown are of opinion that
Sunday enlistments are quite legal, and that it is
the duty of a magistrate to act accordingly.” To
deal in muffins—giving note of such dealing by
means of the very smallest bell—on Sunday or
any other day, would submit the criminal to a fine
or imprisonment; but to purchase men—biped
“food for gunpowder”—on the Sabbath, is “quite
legal.” This is encouraging for recruiting serjeants,
who may now.look out for the human commodity
even at the church door.

33ptraorbinarp ſtiabnegg among the ſūartſ) flareg.
THE periodical mania which is well known to be epidemic in the
month of March amongst hares is, we understand, unusually prevalent
this year, in consequence of LoRD AshBURTON having, in his place in
the House of Peers, announced his intention of proposing, at some
future stage of LoRD DACRE's “Game Law Amendment Bill,” to take
them out of the class of Game. The hares are frantic at the prospect
now before them, of being deprived of that protection which they have
hitherto enjoyed in common with the Landed Interest in general.
They are said to utter in their paroxysms of frenzy, ravings of the
most awful description, yet exhibiting a certain consistency; so that
there is some method in their madness. We are informed by several
rural correspondents, well versed in the interpretation of the animal
languages, that the tenor of their valid effusions is as follows:–
They declare that if Protection is taken away from them, it will not
much longer be afforded to the partridges. The partridges having
been deprived of their ancient privilege, the next step will be to with-
draw it from the pheasants. The spoliation of the grouse, quail, land-
rail, and woodcock will follow, till at length the deer itself will be
levelled with the vulgar herd. The suppression of stag-hunting will be
the consequence of the stag's debasement, and by a necessary result
the abolition of the order of stag-hunters will succeed. This will be
tantamount to the extinction of the aristocracy, which will involve the
subversion of the Church and the overthrow of the Monarchy.
The lunatic hares call loudly on their species to rally round their
forms, and take all constitutional means that they can devise for main-
taining their vested rights, and perpetuating their existence in their
native clover. In this effort they invite all other descriptions of game,
and all those who are interested in its preservation, to join ; and fur-
ther, in their behalf, they loudly invoke the British Lion : which is a
sane mark of their insanity; for that noble animal, being a beast of
prey, will be only too happy to eat them all up.
THE EXETER 'CHANGE ARCADE.
ECENTLY a convulsive attempt has been made to give
an air of life and gaiety to this dreary abode of
dentists and doll-merchants. There has been a
vigorous effort to get up a kind of season by the
engagement of a small band of three musicians, of
which the cornet acts as conductor, the fiddle as
first and only violin, while the harp takes the
position of répétiteur with amiable humility. The
active and energetic beadle officiates as master of
the ceremonies, and during the playing of the
various morceaua, he occasionally lolls back in
the state Windsor chair with his legs crossed, or
resting on the sill of the unoccupied boutique in
the corner. There is something charming in the
easy nonchalance with which he dandles backwards and forwards the
weapon of office—now placing it across his knees—now poising it on
the tip of his toe—and now brandishing it playfully in a half-mena-
cing manner at some passing associate.
At present the attempt to get up an excitement and gaiety in the
Exeter 'Change Arcade has not been followed by the happiest results,
though the band has played nearly two hundred polkas during the past
week; and the beadle, in the enthusiasm of the moment, has not only
beaten time with the iron heels of his high-lows, but mildly whistled
an obligato accompaniment. The promenade has occasionally been
brisk, but it has not added much to the commercial prosperity of the
Arcade, for people do not rush into dentists' shops to have their teeth
pulled out, nor do they stop suddenly to buy a doll, to the sounds of
cheerful melody. There is generally a somewhat extensive juvenile
conversazione at the gate of the Arcade, which is instantly turned into
a rout by the beadle, who routs out the boys with the butt end of his
staff, and insists on their keeping moving. It is whispered that the
cornet will take a benefit in the course of the Easter week, when he
will play a solo on the triangle, for that night only. No money will be
taken at the gates, but a hat and three saucers will be handed up and
down the Arcade in the course of the evening. HERR Von Row has
promised to attend with his drum and Pandean pipes, but as he never
keeps his word his presence cannot be counted upon.
WANTED, A NEW GOVERNMENT.
THE country party will be very much puzzled
to find a Premier in the event of SIR
R. PEEL being unable to carry his mea-
sure. The public may judge of the ex-
Minister.
Every one knows our fondness for
the ex-Chancellor, and no one will deny
that we have taken every opportunity
of writing him up, drawing him up,
dressing him up, and touching him up
in first-rate style ; but we should as
soon think of recommending PRoPEs-
sor Risley, the posture master, to re-
gulate the present posture of the nation, as dream of accepting
BROUGHAM in the capacity of a Prime Minister. MRs. HARRIs
broadly insinuates that SIR. R. PEEL wrote a leader the other day in
the Times against Lond BRough AM. Whether the Minister really is
engaged to devote his spare time, after governing the country, to the
service of our contemporary, is a secret that our contemporary alone
can tell ; but SIR. R. PEEL must have enough to do if he has to sit down
and write a leader after quitting the House of Commons.
This sort of thing is more in BRough AM's way, and if there were a
little more life and spirit in the ex-organ of the Government, we
should fancy that he might be taking a sly turn at the handle. By the
bye, if PEEL does write, he seems to be writing in a good school, for
we are told he is trying to imitate ourselves, who, we always thought,
were utterly inimitable. But, says MRs. HARRIs,
“This writer may affect to follow the example of Punch and the Times in speaking
slightingly of the noble and learned lord ; but he, at least, well knows that there is not a
man in England who occupies a higher place in the estimation of his countrymen, or
so high a place in the estimation of foreigners, as the truly great man at whom he points
his hypocritical sueers.”
By the way, who is HE that knows this, that, and the other, so
thoroughly 2 Is the HE Punch himself or the Times, or the noble and
learned lord, or this writer, who is so emphatically italicised. High
position indeed . We know very well that BRough AM occupies a high
position, for we have given it to him.
THE CRIES OF PARLIAMENT.
AMoNG the London Cries alluded to in various descriptions of the
metropolis, those uttered by the voice of Parliament have been some-
what unaccountably omitted. These cries, and their import, are prin-
cipally the following:—

T H E S N OBS OF E N G L A N D.
BY ONE OF THEMSELVES.
CHAP. II.--THE SNOB ROYAL.
oNG since, at the com -
mencement of the reign
of her present GRAcious
MAJESTY, it chanced “on
a fair summer evening,'
as MR. JAMEs would say,
that three or four young
cavaliers were drinking a
cup of wine after dinner
at the hostelry called the
KING's ARMs, kept by
Mistress ANDERSON, in
the royal village of Ken-
sington. 'Twas a balmy
evening, and the wayfarers
looked out on a cheerful
scene. The tall elms of
the ancient gardens were
in full leaf, and countless
chariots of the nobility of
England whirled , by to
the neighbouring palace,
where princely Sussex (whose income latterly only allowed him to give tea-parties)
entertained his royal niece at a state banquet. When the caroches of the nobles had
set down their owners at the banquet-hall, their varlets and servitors came to
quaff a flagon of nut-brown ale in the King's Arms garden, hard by. We watched
these fellows from our lattice. By Saint Boniface 'twas a rare sight !
The tulips in MyNHEER WAN DUNK's gardens were not more gorgeous than the
liveries of these pie-coated retainers. All the flowers of the field bloomed in their
ruffled bosoms, all the hues of the rainbow gleamed in their plush breeches, and the
long-caned ones walked up and down the garden with that charming solemnity,
that delightful quivering swagger of the calves, which has always had a frantic
fascination for us. The walk was not wide enough for them as the shoulder-knots
strutted up and down it in canary, and crimson, and light blue. Suddenly, in the
midst of their pride, a little bell was rung, a side door opened, and (after setting
down their Royal Mistress) HER MAJESTY's own CRIMsoN FootMEN, with epaulets
and black plushes, came in.
It was pitiable to see the other poor Johns slink off at this arrival Not one
of the honest private Plushes could stand up before the Royal Flunkies. They
left the walk : they sneaked into dark holes and drank their beer in silence. The
Royal Plush kept possession of the garden until the Royal Plush dinner was an-
nounced, when it retired, and we heard from the pavilion where they dined conser-
vative cheers, and speeches, and Kentish fires. The other Flunkies we never saw
Inore.
My dear Flunkies, so absurdly conceited at one moment, and so abject at the
next, are but the types of their masters in this world. He who meanly admires mean
things is a Snob-perhaps that is a safe definition of the character.
And this is why I have, with the utmost respect, ventured to place THE SNoB
Roy AL at the head of my list, causing all others to give way before him, as the
Flunkies before the royal representative in Kensington Gardens. To say of such
and such a Gracious Sovereign that he is a Snob, is but to say that His Majesty is
a man. Kings, too, are men and Snobs. In a country where Snobs are in the
majority, a prime one, surely, cannot be unfit to govern. With us they have
succeeded to admiration.
For instance, JAMEs I. was a Snob, and a Scotch Snob, than which the world
contains no more offensive creature. He appears to have had not one of the good
qualities of a man—neither courage, nor generosity, nor honesty, nor brains: but
read what the great Divines and Doctors of England said about him : CHARLEs II.
his grandson was a rogue, but not a Snob ; whilst Louis XIV., his old squaretoes
of a contemporary, the great worshipper of Bigwiggery—has always struck me
as a most undoubted and Royal Snob.
I will not, however, take instances from our own country of Royal Snobs,
but refer to a neighbouring kingdom, that of Brentford—and its monarch, the late
great and lamented GoRGIUs IV. With the same humility, with which the foot-
men at the King's Arms gave way before the Plush Royal, the aristocracy of the
Brentford nation bent down and truckled before GoRGIUs, and proclaimed him the
first gentleman in Europe. And it's a wonder to think what is the gentlefolks'
opinion of a gentleman, when they gave GoRGIUs such a title.
What is it to be a gentleman 2 Is it to be honest, to be gentle, to be generous,
to be brave, to be wise, and, possessing all these qualities, to exercise them in the
most graceful outward manner ? Ought a gentleman to be a loyal son, a true
husband, and honest father ? Ought his life to be decent—
his bills to be paid—his tastes to be high and elegant—
his aims in life lofty and noble In a word, ought not
the Biography of a First Gentleman in Europe to be of
such a nature, that it might be read in Young Ladies'
Schools with advantage, and studied with profit in the
Seminaries of Young Gentlemen I put this question to
all instructors of youth—to MRs. Ellis and the Women
of England; to all schoolmasters, from Doctor HAwtrey
down to MR. SQUEERs. I conjure up before me an awful
tribunal of youth and innocence, attended by its venerable
instructors, (like the ten thousand red-cheeked charity-
children in Saint Paul's) sitting in judgment, and Gorgius
pleading his cause in the midst. Out of Court, out of
Court, fat old Florizel ! Beadles, turn out that bloated,
pimple-faced man If GoRG1Us must have a statue in
the new Palace which the Brentford nation is building, it
ought to be set up in the Flunkies' Hall. He should be
represented cutting out a coat, in which art he is said to
have excelled. He also invented Maraschino punch, a
shoe-buckle, (this was in the vigour of his youth, and the
prime force of his invention,) and a Chinese pavilion, the
most hideous building in the world. He could drive a
four-in-hand very nearly as well as the Brighton Coach-
man, could fence elegantly, and, it is said, played the
fiddle well. And he smiled with such irresistible fascina-
tion, that persons who were introduced into his august
presence became his victims, body and soul, as a rabbit
becomes the prey of a great big boa-constrictor.
I would wager that if MR. WIDDIcomb were, by a
revolution, placed on the throne of Brentford, people
would be equally fascinated by his irresistibly majestic
smile, and tremble as they knelt down to kiss his hand.
If he went to Dublin they would erect an obelisk on the
spot where he first landed, as the Paddylanders did when
GoRGIUs visited them. We have all of us read with
delight that story of the King's voyage to Haggisland,
where his presence inspired such a fury of loyalty ; and
where the most famous man of the country—the BARon
of BRADwardINE—coming on board the royal yacht, and
finding a glass out of which GoRGIUs had drunk, put it
into his coat pocket as an inestimable relic, and went
ashore in his boat again. But the Baron sat down upon
the glass and broke it, and cut his coat-tails very much ;
and the inestimable relic was lost to the world for ever.
O noble BRADwARDINE what Old-World superstition could
set you on your knees before such an idol as that ?
If you want to moralise upon the mutability of human
affairs, go and see the figure of GoRGIUs in his real, iden-
tical robes, at the waxwork.-Admittance one shilling.
Children and flunkies sixpence. Go, and pay sixpence.
CHIVALRY FOR THE CITY.
WE observe that a grand contest is pending between the
Lord Mayor on the one hand, and the President of Christ's
Hospital on the other, as to which of those dignitaries shall
take the chair at the hospital suppers at Christ's Church.
An interchange of protocols and manifestoes has taken
place; but these have been unsatisfactory : and the matter
stands over for consideration. An appeal to law would
involve an awful expenditure of both civic and hos-
pital treasure, and we earnestly hope that the dispute
will be submitted to arbitration. Any good Bluecoat-boy
would be an appropriate reference. He would ask no
more than a halfpenny to consider the question, and the
same coin, should the claims of the high contending parties
prove equally balanced, would enable him, by an obvious
expedient, to effect its settlement. Failing this, the ulti-
mate resort would be an appeal to arms ; and we would
suggest knives and forks—yes ; war to the knife and fork.
Let the lists be spread in Guildhall, in the shape of
tables, and let the champions make trial of their respective
prowess, by an onslaught on the turtle and venison—defy-
ing one another to the teeth. Surely this form of the
“Wager of Battle” would be the best for determining pre-
cedence at a supper-table.

PUNCH*S POLITICAL DICTIONARY.
Excise DUTIEs. The taxes levied on articles of consumption pro-
duced within the kingdom. The word is derived from ercido, to cut
out, and means that a good slice is taken out of everything affected
by the Excise duties. They commenced in the reign of CHARLEs THE
FIRST by a tax on beer, and Oliver CRomwell being a brewer, was
no doubt excited to rebellion by this attack on his double X. If he had
been a milkman, and there had been a duty on chalk, he would pro-
bably have been equally refractory. Among exciseable articles we
find soap, which was felt to be such a grievance, that “How are you
off for soap” has become a common mode of salutation among the
poorer classes of society. There is a heavy excise duty on hackney
coaches, but the heaviest duty of all falls upon the horses employed in
drawing the vehicles. In these cases, however, there is often a tre-
mendous drawback, of which nobody gets the benefit.
ExILE... A state of exclusion from the isle, though there has been
nonregularly recognised exile since the celebrated “Exile of Erin,” whose
remarkable case will be found stated at length in one of MistER
CAMPBELL's charming songs. The form of dooming a person to exile
is still occasionally gone through on the British stage, when a prince
at a pound a-week dooms a traitor at five-and-twenty shillings to per-
petual banishment. Practically speaking, however, this species of
exile only consigns the object of it for a few minutes to the green-
TOOln.
ExpoRTs. Things sent out of port. PUFFENDoRF doubts whether
a large lump of doubtful beeswing taken from a bottle of two-and-
fourpenny port can properly be termed an export.
ExTRA-PARoch LAL. That which is beyond the bounds of a parish.
The unbounded quantity of gold lace on the coat of PUMMELL, the
Kensington beadle, seems to be rather extra parochial. It is certain
that, comparing it with the quiet and sober surtout of the peace-
officer of the district, the parish, in the excessive finery of its beadle,
may be said to have outrun the constable. Some of the inhabitants
are of opinion, that—
“Pummell when unadorn'd 's adorn'd the most;"
but our own view of the questionis, that.there might be some reason
in observing a medium.
FACTor. A mercantile, agent who buys and sells.
Some derive
the word factor from facio to do, because some factors are in the habit
of doing their customers. The chief duty of a factor is to receive
consignments and remit money or goods, but he occasionally performs
only the first part of his duty, and wholly neglects the second.
The LUCKY.RUSSIAA COMPANY.
A DAY, or two since, the Russia Company held its Anniversary
Dinner, in commemoration of their connexion with the land, or rather
the ice, of the Czar. It is a very old Company, having been the pur-
veyors of bears' grease to Queen ElizaBETH and her maids of honour,
for in those days Rowland was not. The Company meet every year,
for the principal-purpose of laying one-very-thick—a lot of paint and
gilding upon the EMPERoR Nicholas, just as the Saracen's Head is
newly decorated every twelvemonth. The room was ornamented in the
most complimentary way to the Emperor, being festooned with knouts.
A picture, showing the wickedness of the Minsk nuns, was exhibited
for the first time, and drew forth great commendations for the natural
way in which some received stripes—in which others sank beneath
their burthens. BARoN BRUNNow declared the work a chef-d'oeuvre, from
its fidelity to the real scene. -
Many speeches were made, BARoN BRUNNow threw the company
into delirious ecstasy by observing—
“You are now-the-only commercial corporation enjoying the High Distinction of
having in your possession the portrait ºf the Sovereign of Russia and of the Hereditary
Grand Duke. (Cheers.)"
Yes: the ledger-loving, slaves “cheered.” The portrait of Nicho. As !
Well, heaven knows it is bad enough to know that the portrait of the
Royal child-stealer, the woman-torturer, is among us : it is certainly
bad enough to have his portrait; but oh, Englishmen how grateful
ought we to be that we are spared the original |
on THE DULNess of Thr DEBATE, AND THE LITTLE INTEREST FELT IN IT.
No wonder the debate fell dead,
'Neath such a constant fire of lead.

DON ROEBUCCO, THE SMALLEST MAN IN “THE HOUSE"
AMID the glut
of dwarves that
have lately been
thrown upon the
English market,
we must not for-
get the genuine
smallest man in
“the House,” DoN
ARTURO Roebuc-
co, who beats
ToM THUMB to
the very smallest
atoms, and snuffs
out all the Eng-
lish and Spanish
THUMBs that have
been lately trying
to make the maac-
imum of profit out
of the minimum of
material. The
great free-trade
principle, of buy-
ing in the cheap-
est market, and
selling in the dear-
est, is exemplified
by the dwarfish
practice of mak-
ing the most .
money of £ the
smallest parcel.
There is one
great peculiarity
in DoN ARTURO
Roebucco, in . All
which he is dis-
tinguished from
all other dwarves
that have pre-
ceded him. Every
little lump of
humanity, from
the half-crown's
worth at the
Egyptian Hall, to
the pennyworth
in the caravan at
Greenwich Fair,
has been in the
habit of making ,
himself out ex-
ceedingly small,
while DoN ARTU-
Ro Roebucco not
only avoids this
appellation, but
really runs into
the opposite ex-
treme, of thinking
himself the great-
est, instead of the
smallest man in
England. He re-
minds us, in this
respect, of the
goose which, it is.

2.
head when pass-
ing under a barn-
door; and Roe-
Bucco is continu-

self to all intents
and purposes. In
his own estima-
tion he is a giant,
and bangs about
his great noisy
gong to call atten-
tion to his won-
drous altitude;
but when he be-
gins to make an
exhibition of him-
self, it is evident
that he is only
remarkable for
his excessive and
supernatural, or
ratherinfra-natu-
ral, littleness. He
stands—in public
opinion — some-
thing less than
four-and-twenty
inches high ; and
it is a remarkable
fact that he seems
to be executing a
diminuendomove-
ment every day,
for he gets gradu-
ally less and less;
so that we should
hardly be sur-
prisedathis even-
tually going out of
sight altogether.
Like his rivals in
the dwarfish pro-
fession, he under-
takes variouscha-
racters for the
amusement of
lookers-on, and
he succeeds in
producing ludi-
crous effects by
contrasts likethat
between General
Tom Thumm and
NApoleon. Dox
ARturo's favour-
ite impersona.
tions are those of
a politician and a
Queen's counsel.
The latter is one
of the richest
pieces of bur-
lesque that has
been seen for a
very long period.
He seems as ab-
surd in his silk
gown, as General
Tom Thumb does
in the uniform of
Buonaparte.
THE MARLBOROUGH PIECE OF PLATE.
THE newspapers have published an account of a centre-piece just group is intended to illustrate the independence of the Electors of

MARLBorough. The account forwarded to us does certainly differ from their necks. The DUKE of MARLBorough himself is represented as a

THE SHREWSBURY PET.
--
E-saw-a-week or two ago
an anecdote which
-went the round of
the papers — in
which we were told
that the Duke of
NAssau, his dignity
unknown, asked of
a peasant, if the
Rhine-rose or fell.
The peasant re-
plied, “What an
ass-you--must be
not to see that it
rises.” Immedi-
ately after this, the
peasant learns the
rankofhis querist;
whereupon he thus
congratulates him-
self:-"Well, I’m
glad I wasn'trude!"
It was plain that
the peasant was
never rude—never
“abused” anybody;
he was, in fact, an
inglorious Dis-
It Al-L1.
The Irish pilot
only knew every
rock by continu-
ally making his ship bump upon it; now, on the contrary, it is won-
derful how very closely the Member for Shrewsbury can steer to Bil-

At a grand meeting of the beasts—unnoticed by AEsop—the fox was
twitted by the ermine with his disagreeable odour. The circumstance
reached the ears of the pole-cat ; who, lamenting the fetor of the fox,
said very meekly of himself, “I thank my stars, whatever may be my
faults, my scent “abuses” the nose of no one. “Nobody, can say the

A JUDICl AL DILEMMA.
*WE really believe there is not a more amiable man on the bench or
at the bar than MR. SERJEANT ADAMs. He is, like a summer cabbage,
all heart, and we regret to see him puzzled what to do with the juvenile
criminals upon whom, in his capacity of Chairman of the Middlesex
Sessions, ſhe is compelled to pass sentence. He usually appeals
pathetically to the jury, as if they could get him out of his dilemma.
“Here,” says he, “is a boy of tender years, and what am I to do with
him 2 . If I send him to prison, I send him to ruin. They won't let me
send him to Parkhurst : I can't discharge him. If I were to flog him,
it would do him no good. His mother is always drunk, and his father
has been transported.” It is with no desire to ridicule MR. SERJEANT
AnAMs's amiable anxiety on the subject of juvenile offenders that we
notice the predicament he is continually being placed in for want of
reformatories instead of prisons, for the reception of young delinquents.
The worthy Serjeant keeps up the agitation of the subject with most
praiseworthy pertinacity, and never lets an opportunity pass for
showing the perplexity in which he is placed by the supineness of
the legislature. “Here I am again, gentlemen,” he cries, “with
another little pickpocket of tender years, that I have no means of dis-
posing of in a satisfactory manner.”
The jury can only look stupid when the worthy Serjeant adroitly
takes advantage of that fact to exclaim, “I see by your faces, gentle-
men, that you quite agree with me in my view of the case : ” and a
report, of course, goes forth, that the jury perfectly coincided in every
word that fell from the lips of the Chairman. Formerly he could
enlighten the little boys about Parkhurst, telling them he was going to
send them where they would have an opportunity of becoming decent
members of Colonial society at a future period. Parkhurst being now
closed against all but mature criminals, SERJEANT ADAMs has nothing
to say to his little thieves, but to sentence them, and lament over their
probable-corruption in prison. It is, however, seriously speaking, “too
Examine the
bad,” and we have no doubt the worthy Serjeant will, by constantly
keeping it up, ultimately compel attention to the complaints he is always
making. Already there have been one or two meetings in the City,
and if ADAMs only goes on asking the jury what he is to do with
little pickpockets, and the juries go on looking stupid at the question,
the legislature will at last be compelled to stir itself.
133and)'s QItstimonials.
BELErving that one of the most profitable branches of literature in
the present day is that of supplying Testimonials to the qualities of
sundry specifics that are being continually advertised, we have some
idea of “doing a little in that line,” and we beg leave to offer the
following specimens of our qualifications for this very lucrative depart-
ment of an author's profession. It is true that we have not a title,
like the EARL of ALDBoRough, who is continually being cured of every
malady under the sun, by HollowAY's pills; but we may at all events
claim to be among that class of aristocracy familiarly known as
“nature's noblemen,” and usually occupying the sixpenny gallery at the
minor theatres. As a portion of the peerage of the people, we consider
that our Testimonials will be almost if not quite as respectable as the
EARL of ALDBoRough's. Our terms for a recommendation in the
following strain will be found very moderate, and we have no objection
to have our portrait prefixed to the advertisement, showing us as we
were before the specific (in a state of perfect prostration of course),
and as we were after one bottle of the mixture (that is to say, dancing
about our apartment, hopping, skipping, and jumping over the chairs
and tables, in the usual style of people just recovering from a recent
illness). The following is a specimen of a Testimonial in favour of
DR. Locock's PULMoN1c warERs.
“Sir—I was overrun with black beetles. I had tried hedgehogs out
of number, without effect, and had spent a little fortune in those
absurd machines called black beetle traps, when I was persuaded to try
your pulmonic wafers. Such was their wonderful effect that in a few
days there was not a cockroach to be met with in the whole of, the
premises.”
TESTIMONIAL IN FAVOUR OF MACAss AIt soil.
“I had for some years been afflicted with a most obstinate lamp,
which would not burn either Solar Oil, Sperm, or Camphine. At length
I tried a bottle of your Macassar, which answered every purpose, and,
indeed, the luminous effect was so decided, that I have been light-
headed ever since I had recourse to it.”
TESTIMONIAL IN FAvourt of HollowAY's oint MENT.
“SIR,--I beg leave to state that the creaking of the wheels of my
dust-cart had become so severe, that my nerves were fearfully affected
by the harsh discord. I had used the common cart-grease very
copiously without effect, when I, in a fit of desperation, bought a box
of your invaluable ointment. By continually applying it to the wheels,
all unpleasant noise has been stopped, and my cart is now the admira-
tion of every one who formerly used to be shocked by its dissonance.
You are at liberty to make any use you please of this letter.
“J. BUGDEN.”
“Please to send me eighteen more boxes. The man will pay for
them when he comes round to empty the dust-hole.”
TEs.TIMoni AL IN FAvour of MoRRison's PILLs.
“GENTLEMEN, My garden had been for several years infested with
| grubs, wire-worms, snails, and slugs, so that nothing would grow in
it. Having seen the advertisement of your pills, I was induced to pur-
chase a box, and I sowed a few of the pills among a quantity of onion-
seed. I am happy to say that your pills killed everything that came
near them, and I do not think a single grub “survives to tell the tale.’
“I am, sir,
“Your grateful and obedient servant,
“John SHARPshoes.”
The above are a few specimens of what we are able to do in this
style. . The proprietors of any specific or medicine for curing every
disease, may be treated with, on liberal terms, by applying at the

*The " Pot and "the Rettle.
MR. Roebuck, during the recent debate, took occasion to repudiate
the practice of using coarse language, descending to vulgar menace,
and being guilty of violent persomalities in the House of Commons.
This reminds us of the Regular Dustman who, in his Christmas circulars,
never fails to let the public know, through the medium of a haughty
N.B., “that he has no connection with the scavengers.”

Eton Boy, (loq.)—“Come, Governor Just one Toast.
THE LADIEs '"
M. R. S. B | B2S BABY.
CHAPTER WI.
BABY BIB is a doomed infant—a ruined child—a tippler in long
clothes ; the seductive aniseed curdling “the innocent milk in its most
innocent mouth.” Only a few weeks old, it is given to drinking, and
the sweet vice growing with it, makes it in a very few days a roaring,
screaming, fighting, bullying, most disreputable Baby. Its character
as the best of infants, was gone for ever. There it would lie upon the
threshold of the world—like a sot upon a door-step—very drunk indeed.
And the callous, destructive grandmother would smile upon her victim,
as though particularly proud of the ruin accomplished. The one
spoonful of aniseed soon became one and a half; then two ; then three;
—and when at length Baby BIB was in the depths of sleep and liquor,
MRs. DAFFY would cackle a laugh, and cry she “knew what the blessed
darling wanted; just a drop—only a drop, to comfort it.”
Search every nursery throughout the kingdom—canvas the merits
of every Baby, from the very best porcelain babies of the best houses,
to the common red clay babies of Indian wigwams, and it would be
impossible to find any individual in long clothes, born with sweeter
disposition—with more temperate habits—than Baby BIB. With what
an earnest, business-like faculty it would imbibe the blessed fluid—
heaven-distilled—to nourish it. Every atom of it would seem engaged
in that most comfortable employment : every pore of it seemed to
drink, drink, drink.” It looked neither to the right nor the left, but,
with the vigour of new life, did nothing but drink. And then would
an angel of Peace—one of the host appointed, whose duty it is to
linger at mothers' laps—at cradles and cots, and wheresoever the
human nestling rests—its soul scarce breaking through its baby eyes
—then would an angel, with its harmonious wings, fan Baby to sleep,
and its little upturned bud of a face would look beautiful with the spirit
of quiet that had entered it, and at its little half-closed mouth would
seem some half-uttered sound ! But this was in the days of Baby's
innocence and unmixed milk.
Thus was Baby BIB taken from the pure path—from its true via
lactea—by its dissipated old grandmother, and the change in its
peaceful, sober habits was shocking for even the most stolid nursery-
maid—albeit used, indeed hardened to children—to look upon. That
which before was Baby BIB's great solace and delight—the blest and
blessing point of its existence, whence it drew forth life, and happiness,
and marble-looking sleep—became a thing of second thoughts : Nay,
at times Baby BIB would scream at it, and grow red in the face at it,
and by no manner of coaxing be made for a moment to endure it, but
with both fists fight wildly about it. And, in a word, from the very

mently accuses his babihood of gluttony “at the breast.” See his Confessions for both
the melancholy fact and the after penitence.
best and most mother-loving of babes, it became little better than a
mad little NERo in long clothes.
It is an astounding truth—a truth little considered by man,
when, in his bridegroom best, he stands before the altar, for the
moment manipulating the ring end of the chain ere he fixes it—it is
an astounding truth that there is no household noise like the noise of
a baby, when determined to make a ruffian of itself. There was not a
macaw in the Ark that would not have been silenced by SHEM's Baby,
had the little one resolved to test its screams. Now Baby BIB could
get anything by crying for it. At a remarkably early time of life
Baby became acquainted with the value of this truth, and therefore
shrieked and cried with amazing sagacity. And so, with a growing
love for aniseed, with a determination not to go to bed without it,
passing to sleep upon the mere insipidity of milk, Baby BIB never
saw its night-gown unfolded—never felt itself turned upon its stomach
to be undone at the back—that Baby did not begin to shout, and roar,
and scream, and threaten to stop its breath, and go out of the world
at once in a spasm.
“What would it have, then 2 Would it have its comfort, and be
good?” Comfort : At the word the red and purple-faced little rebel
would "kick, and turn up its nose, and halloo, as though the proffered
comfort was a vinegar-cruet. No : it had been used to aniseed;
and it would no more go to bed and be quiet, and let its father rest
without it, than would any sea-captain pass into the sheets without
his stiff mightcap of stiff grog. No . Baby BIB would have its
tipple ; it looked and roared determination upon that point. And if
it did not have it, why it would make such a noise about midnight,
that Father BIB, roused in his first sleep, would say something impa-
tient, something disrespectful of babies in general ; whereupon Mamma
BIB would meekly remonstrate, and then meekly weep, and then get
out of bed, and walk the room with the sweetest, dearest, noisiest,
little precious that was ever made,-the father of the blessing rolling
his head in the bed-clothes, and muttering deep bass in the sheets.
“SARAH, my dear,” said MRs. DAFFY, as Baby BIB lay upon her lap
helpless in all but shrieking—“SARAH, this dear infant must have
something. It's plain aniseed's no good now—not powerful enough.
For the child is wonderful strong ; wonderful indeed ; quite gets up
in my lap. SARAH, you must try some GoDFREY’s.”
“Not a drop ; no, that I'm determined upon, mother. I'm only
sorry that the dear love has had anything but its natural food, as BIB
says. Very sorry, indeed,” said MRs. BIB.
“SARAH,” observed MRs. DAFFY, considerably hurt, but kindly
endeavouring to control her feelings, “SARAH, you don't think I'd in-
jure your blessed child, do you ? Natural food, indeed . Well, it isn't
for me to interfere, of course, with other people's children ; but I’ve
had nine—only nine babies.” (MRs. DAFFY always invoked her tune-
ful nine.) “BIB will have no rest again to-night, and of course come
down like a fury to breakfast. And then the names he sometimes calls
the blessed infant, when he's only been kept awake, is dreadful to think
of. He doesn't deserve such a child, and I only hope he won't lose it,
—that's all. All I know is, SARAH, if your father—ha! the nights he
used to walk the room with my first three l—if your father, SARAH,
had said a twentieth as much against any of you, I'd have—but, of
course, BIB's your husband, and I've no business to say a word. I
should never forgive myself if I did. Never, SARAH. Still, I can't
see this blessed creature suffer as it does, when I know that a few
drops—just a few—drops of GoDFREY's, as innocent as mother's milk,
would comfort its little inside, and make it as good as any angel. And
I'm sure, SARAH, you look quite worn-out ; and I know you’ve been
crying because of BIB's ill-temper. Now, don't let him know it,
SARAH ; don't—if you wouldn't be an unhappy woman. If I’d have
given in to crying with your father—and I was very near it—a pretty
time I should have had of it. Now, you must send for the GoDFREY’s.”
—The bell was rung.
“If BIB should know it !” cried the weak MRs. BIB, the weaker
that she had given in to aniseed—“if he should know it!”—
“How should he know it He'll know that he'll get a good sleep
to-night; and that's all men—if they spoke in their hearts—care
about. He'll sleep, and this dear creature will be pacified. BECKY,

vered by inquiring wisdom, and further legalised by the solemnity of

twelve months old.

Punch is suddenly smitten with the spirit of utility; he therefore purposes to throw open
his pages—wide as his heart—to fac-similejengravings of all that is new and beautiful in
household decoration ; and requests that pembroke-tables—scroll fenders—ottomans—
lounging-chairs—reading-desks—with every description of new crockery and pottery, may
be immediately forwarded to him. He promises to review them ; and he also promises to
keep them. For, shall not the reviewer be paid for his ink 2
In this brief preface, however, Punch can only hint his intentions. It is his purpose to
make a tour in the manufacturing districts, that he may, in his pages, display to astonished
Englishmen the wealth and ingenuity of England. Punch purposes to begin with the eatables.
Hence he will, make a pilgrimage to Richmond, to report upon and give cuts of the melting
maids-of-honour. He will next visit Chelsea, for the purpose of making known the virtues
of the humble bun. He will then proceed to Epping, to inspect the largesausage manufactory,
taking with him his artist to faithfully represent the scene. He will next make a descent
upon the town of Banbury, distinguished for its cakes ; and, heedless of time, labour, and
expense, will go through the whole of Hampshire, giving splendid cuts of its bacon. Cam-
bridge butter will find a place in his pages, which will also be open to Canterbury brawn.
It being the wish of Punch to furnish his larder with the greatest possible despatch, and
the least possible expense, dealers in the above commodities are requested to furnish early
copies for Punch's artist.

EXTRAORDINARY INSTANCE OF CANINE SAGACITY.
“MR. PUNCH,-I possess a most sagacious dog. I am no stranger to the exploits of
the Great St. Bernard dogs who carry the bells; I admit the shining qualities of the
dog EMILE. But, sir, I consider that my dog bears the bell from the dogs of St. Bernard,
and takes the shine out of the Canis Major of Astley's. You shall judge.
“When I show him one of your engravings of SIR Robert PEEL, he shuts his left eye, at the
same time wagging his tail respectfully ; this, sir, I interpret as a recognition of superior
sagacity, truly worthy of a sagacious animal.
“When shown a head of LoRD John RUssell, on the other hand, he immediately
elevates his off fore-paw to a level with his snout in a significant manner. Am I, can I be
wrong in supposing this to be his imperfect method of inquiring whether the fact of
his ºnly. absence from Downing Street is, in the maternal department, as yet a
Secret
“LoRD BRough AM and WAUx being brought under his notice, the animal gave vent to
several short, dry barks; this, sir, was canine laughter, not unmixed with sarcasm.
“The sight of the Poet BUNN produced a long and melancholy howl.
“When, however, I spread your pages before him, and direct his attention to the letter-
press, he immediately falls over on his back and rolls about in convulsions, barking spasmo-
picture of “Richard III. at his Prayers ;’ viz.,
* long low growl of true cynical disgust.
“I tried another experiment, which had such
sad effects, that I much repented it ; I offered
the poor animal a speech of the Member for
Knaresborough ; the result was vomiting, followed
by indigestion, loss of appetite, bile, fever, dis-
temper, and all the maladies to which his too
delicate nervous organization rendered him liable.
“On seeing LoRD PALMERSTON, he signifi-
cantly turned himself six times completely round.
“On being shown two speeches of SIR JAMEs
GRAHAM's, one delivered in 1841, and the other in

other, then up to me, as if for an explanation;
but receiving none of a nature to satisfy him,
he shook his head, and (looking me in the face)
pointed with his fore paw first to the North, then
to the South ; which I took to mean, that the
two were as far as the poles asunder.
“Seeing an engraving of the Liberator of Ire-
land, he immediately begged.
“The speeches of MR. MILEs and SIR John
TYRREL and others, in the late debate, had also
a curious effect upon him. Taking between his
teeth my pocket-handkerchief, (a large and mag-
nificent bandana,) which happened to be within
his reach, he made as if he would nail it to the
leg of the table ; at the same time endeavouring
(and really not without success) to imitate the
roar of the British lion.
“When I wish to signify that it is bed-time, I
show him the Morning Herald, and he instantly

“Once I tried the Standard for the same pur-
pose ; but on that occasion he slept heavily, and
seemed oppressed with nightmare. I have, there-
fore, since preferred the milder narcotic.

TITMARSH p. TAIT. º
“MY DEAR Mr. Punch,
“You are acknowledged to be the censor of the age, and the father and
protector of the press; in which character allow one of your warmest
admirers to appeal to you for redress and protection. One of those good-
natured friends, of whom every literary man can boast, has been
criticising a late work of mine in Tait's Magazine. What his
opinion may be is neither here northere. Every man has a right to
his own ; and whether the critic complains of want of purpose, or says
(with great acuteness and ingenuity) that the book might have been
much better, is not at all to the point. Against criticism of this
nature no writer can cavil. It is cheerfully accepted by your
subscriber.
“But there is a passage in the TAIT criticism which, although it
may be actuated by the profoundest benevolence, a gentleman may be
pardoned for protesting against politely. It is as follows:–
“‘In the circumstance of a steamer being launched on a first
voyage to Margate, or were it but to Greenwich, there is always an in-
vited party, a band of music, a couple of Times and Chronicle reporters,
also champagne and bottled porter, with cakes and jellies for the
ladies. Eren on the Frith of Forth, or Clyde (this “even ' is very
naïf and fine), or the rivers Severn or Shannon, the same auspicious
event is celebrated by the presence of a piper or blind fiddler, carried
cost free, and permitted, on coming home, to send round his hat. On
something like the same principle, the Peninsular and Oriental Com-
pany’ were so fortunate as to crimp Mr. TITMARSH. . . We
hope they have voted him a yachting service of plate, of at least five
hundred ounces.”
This latter. suggestion I complain of, as being too friendly. Why
Who asked the gentleman
for plack or bawbee ? However, this again is a private matter.
“It is that comparison of the blind fiddler who ‘sends round his hat,’
that ought to be devoted to the indignation of the press of these
or' on the Scotch fiddle.
“He leaves the sending round of hats to professors of the Caledonian
Cremona. He was not ‘crimped' by the Peninsular and Oriental
Company, nor called upon to fiddle for their amusement, nor rewarded
degrading obligation, or called upon to pay for his ride by extra joking,
facetiousness, &c.; nor surely is the person who so gives you the use of
his carriage required to present you also with a guinea, or to pay your
tavern-bill. The critic, in fact, has shown uncommon keenness in
observing the manners of his national violinists ; but must know more
of them than of the customs of English gentlemen.
“If the critic himself is a man of letters, and fiddles professionally,
why should he abuse his Stradivarius 2 If he is some disguised
nobleman of lofty birth, superb breeding, and vast wealth, who only
fiddles for pleasure, he should spare those gentlefolks in whose
company he condescends to perform. But I don't believe he's
a noble amateur ;-I think he must be a professional man of letters.
It is only kiterary men, now-a-days, who commit this suicidal sort of
impertinence ; who sneak through the world ashamed of their calling,
and show their independence by befouling the trade by which they live.
“That you will rebuke, amend, or (if need be) utterly smash all
such, is, my dear Mr. Punch, the humble prayer of
“Your constant reader and fellow-labourer,

MRS. H. A R RIS EIOAXED.
It seems after all that poor Mrs. Harris, when she was “authorized”
to give a flat contradiction to the announcement in the Times of the
Repeal of the Corn Laws, was cruelly deceived by some unprincipled
person, who took a fiendish delight in playing upon the poor old crea-
ture's credulity. As she has confessed having been made to “tell a lie
in the words of truth,” we are not disposed to be very severe in our
condemnation. We can only attribute to the proverbial weakness of
her sex her having placed confidence in her heartless betrayer. Hence-
forth, it is to be hoped that she will not lend so willing an ear to the wily
words of the flatterer, which in her extreme softness of disposition
have led her from the paths of rectitude. The question now is, who
has been the betrayer of so much innocence? We ask, in the emphatic
words of the poet :-
Who hoaxed poor Harris f
“I,” said Lord S-Y,
“I own it wasn't manly,
But I hoaxed poor Harris.”
Who told a fib 2
Said Mistress H., “Don’t scold me,
They regularly sold me,
So I told a fib.”
Who came and clenched it 2
“I,” said Mrs. Gamp,
“I gave the fib the stamp ;
I came and clench'd it.”
THE HEAVY MAN OF PARLIAMENT.
MR. D'IsrAELI compared the member for Bath to the heavy man in
a melodrama “bating his breath,” “wagging his finger,” and indulging
in “Sadler's Wells' sarcasms ” in the House of Commons. RoeBUck's
ironical speeches certainly amount to little more than the celebrated
and sardonic “Ha say'st thou,” of the minor drama. There was
something touching in his acknowledging professional failure to be the
cause of his soreness, for we sympathise even with the “heavy man”
at the Surrey, when he stalks about with a bosom full of crushed hopes,
as the alleged cause of all his bitterness. If Roebuck, had not been
himself, he might have been the “recognised tragedian” of the New
Cut, and have shared with MR. N. T. Hicks the laurels of Lambeth.
Now that the latter gentleman is, according to the bills of a
suburban tea-garden, creating a “tremendous excitement” at Hoxton,
MR. Roeduck would have had the whole of St. George's Fields to
himself, without any formidable competitor. - -
There has been nothing since the days of BLANCHARD and BRADLEY
to compare with the recent terrific combats between MEssRs. FERRAND
and Roebuck. We are convinced that the latter gentleman has all the

AN ASTRONOMER IN A FDX.
WE find from a statement in the Glasgow Argus that PROFESSOR
Nichol, who is a sort of local HERscHEL for Scotland—a kind of Glas-
gow GALILEo, has been in a fearful fix during some sagacious observa-
tions on a supposed hurricane. What chiefly puzzled the professor
was, that there seemed to be “no commotion whatever in the atmo-
sphere,” though everything was being carried away on all sides of him.
The anemometer with which he had been measuring the force of the
wind got smashed very speedily, and the astronomer was compelled to
calculate the strength of the gale by the energy with which it “dashed
in the front window of the observatory,” and “blew down, under pecu-
liar circumstances, the stand of the Herschelian telescope.” It seems
that though attached to a block of about a foot in thickness, it was
tossed ten yards from its place, while the magnetic house—an attractive
little building, no doubt, in its way—was levelled to the earth, and the
floor of it carried to six yards distance. The professor must have
fancied he had found his way into ALADDIN's flying palace. He adds
with much simplicity, “I am quite at a loss to account for this storm.”
The rudeness of some people is really quite unaccountable, and under
this class comes the brutal brusquerie of that blusterer, Boreas. The
Scotch astronomer, however, philosophises very quietly on the subject,
and says he thinks “it must have been a storm of translation, or a
mobing whirlwind of large radius but immense power.” This is a
comfortable way of consoling one's self for having one's house blown
about one's ears, at all events. A “storm of translation” we do not
precisely understand the meaning of. We know that translations
shower pretty copiously upon the theatres now and then, and occa-
sionally bring down houses with thunders of applause, but otherwise we
cannot account for PROFEssor Nichol's theory.
THE SNOBS OF ENGLAND.
BY ONE OF THEMSELVES.
CHAP. III. THE INFLUENCE OF THE ARISTOCRACY ON SNOBS.
Ast Sunday week, being at church in
this city, and the service just ended,
I heard two Snobs conversing about
the Parson. One was asking the
other who the clergyman was “He
is Mr. So-and-so,” the second Snob
answered, “domestic chaplain to the
Earl of What-d'ye-call'um.” “Oh, Is
HE 7" said the first Snob, with a tone
of indescribable satisfaction.—The
parson's orthodoxy and identity were
at once settled in this Snob's mind.
He knew no more about the Earl
than about the Chaplain, but he took
5 the latter's character upon the au-
thority of the former; and went home
quite contented with his reverence,
like a little truckling Snob.
This incident gave me more matter for reflection even than the
sermon ; and wonderment at the extent and prevalence of Lord-olatry
in this country. What could it matter to Snob whether his Reverence
were chaplain to his Lordship or not ? What Peerage-worship there
is all through this free country! How we are all implicated in it, and
more or less down on our knees.—And with regard to the great sub-
ject on hand, I think that the influence of the Peerage upon Snobbish-
ness has been more remarkable than that of any other institution.
The increase, encouragement, and maintenance of Snobs are among
the “priceless services,” as LoRD John Russell, says, which we owe
to the nobility.
It can't be otherwise. A man becomes enormously rich, or he jobs
successfully in the aid of a minister, or he wins a great battle,
or executes a treaty, or is a clever lawyer, who makes a multitude
of fees and ascends the bench ; and the country rewards him for ever
with a gold coronet (with more or less balls or leaves) and a title,
and a rank as legislator. “Your merits are so great,” says the nation,
“that your children shall be allowed to reign over us, in a manner.
It does not in the least matter that your eldest son be a fool . we
think your services so remarkable, that he shall have the reversion of
your honours when death vacates your noble shoes. If you are poor
we will give you such a sum of money as shall enable you and the
eldest-born of your race for ever to live in fat and splendour. It is
our wish that there should be a race set apart in this happy country,
who shall hold the first rank, have the first prizes and chances in all
government jobs and patronages. We cannot make all your dear
children Peers—that would make Peerage common and crowd the
house of Lords uncomfortably—but the young ones shall have every-
thing a Government can give . they shall get the pick of all the
places : they shall be Captains and Lieutenant-Colonels at nineteen,
when hoary-headed old lieutenants are spending thirty years at drill ;
they shall command ships at one-and-twenty, and veterans who fought
before they were born. And as we are eminently a free people, and
in order to encourage all men to do their duty, we say to any man of any
rank—get enormously rich, make immense fees as a lawyer, or great
speeches, or distinguish yourself and win battles—and you, even you,
shall come into the privileged class, and your children shall reign
naturally over ours.”
How can we help Snobbishness, with such a prodigious national
institution erected for its worship 2 How can we help cringing to
Lords 2 Flesh and blood can't do otherwise. What man can withstand
this prodigious temptation ? Inspired by what is called a noble emu-
lation, some people grasp at honours and win them ; others, too weak
or mean, blindly admire and grovel before those who have gained
them ; others, not being able to acquire them, furiously hate, abuse,
and envy. There are only a few bland and not-in-the-least-conceited
philosophers, who can behold the state of society, viz., Toadyism,
organised :—base Man-and-Mammon worship, instituted by command
of law :—SNoBBishNEss, in a word, perpetuated, and mark the pheno-
menon calmly. And of these calm moralists, is there one I wonder
whose heart would not throb with pleasure if he could be seen walking
arm-in-arm with a couple of Dukes down Pall Mall ? . No : it is im-
possible, in our condition of society, not to be sometimes a Snob.
On one side it encourages the Commoner to be snobbishly mean :
and the noble to be snobbishly arrogant. When a noble Marchioness
writes in her travels about the hard necessity under which steam-boat
travellers labour of being brought into contact “with all sorts and
conditions of people.” implying that a fellowship with God's crea-
tures is disagreeable to her Ladyship, who is their superior :—when, I
say, the MARCHIoness of LoNDoNDERRY writes in this fashion, we
must consider that out of her natural heart it would have been impos-
sible for any woman to have had such a sentiment; but that the habit
of truckling and cringing, which all who surround her have adopted
towards this beautiful and magnificent lady, this proprietor of so
many black and other diamonds, has really induced her to believe that
she is the superior of the world in general ; and that people are not to
associate with her except awfully at a distance. I recollect being once
at the City of Grand Cairo, through which a European Royal Prince
was passing India-wards. One night at the inn there was a great
disturbance : a man had drowned himself in the well hard by : all the
inhabitants of the hotel came bustling into the Court, and amongst
others your humble servant, who asked of a certain young man the
reason of the disturbance. How was I to know that this young gent.
was a Prince 2 IIe had not his crown and sceptre on ; he was dressed
in a white jacket and felt hat : but he looked surprised at anybody
speaking to him : answered an unintelligible monosyllable, and—
beckoned his Aide-de-Camp to come and speak to me. It is our fault, not
that of the great, that they should fancy themselves so far above us.
If you will fling yourself under the wheels, Juggernaut will go over
you, depend upon it; and if you and I, my dear friend, had Kotoo
performed before us every day, found people whenever we appeared
grovelling in slavish adoration, we should drop into the airs of
superiority quite naturally, and accept the greatness with which the
world insisted upon endowing us.
Here is an instance out of Lord London DERRY's travels, of that
calm, good-natured, undoubting way in which a great man accepts the
homage of his inferiors. After making some profound and ingenious
remarks about the town of Brussels, his Lordship says —“Staying
some days at the Hotel de Belle Vue—a greatly overrated establish-
ment, and not nearly so comfortable as the Hotel de France—I made
acquaintance with DR. L–, the physician of the mission. He was
desirous of doing the honour of the place to me, and he ordered for us
a diner en gourmand at the chief restaurateur's, maintaining it surpassed
the Rocher at Paris. Six or eight partook of the entertainment, and
we all agreed it was infinitely inferior to the Paris display, and much
more extravagant. So much for the copy.”
And so much for the gentleman who gave the dinner. Dr. L---,
desirous to do his Lordship “the honour of the place,” feasts him with
the best victuals money can procure—and my lord finds the enter-
tainment extravagant and inferior. Extravagant it was not extra-

noble jaws, and my lord receives the entertainment, and dismisses the
giver with a rebuke. It is like a three-tailed Pasha grumbling about
an unsatisfactory bucksheesh.
But how should it be otherwise in a country where Lord-olatry is
part of our creed, and our children are brought up to respect the
Peerage as the Englishman's second Bible 7
BU R GLARY AT HERNE B.A. Y.
OUR readers have doubtless heard of a church mouse, and are
acquainted with the proverbial starvation which is the generalfate of an
animal that is rash enough to look for food in an uninhabited edifice.
We should imagine there must be a very considerable analogy between
a church mouse and a Herne Bay burglar. Such a miserable creature
as the latter was, however, found a few days ago, in the act of prac-
tising the trade of a burglar in that desolate settlement. If he had been
given into custody he might well have set up a plea of insanity on his
trial, for who would have disputed the madness of a man attempting
to get a living as a Herne Bayburglar * The effort to extract blood
from a stone is not more insanely desperate than the endeavour to
squeeze an income even as a robber from this impoverished district.
People go to Herne Bay to spend money, it is true, but who ever heard
of any one visiting the spot in the hope of profit *
It seems, however, that one unhappy man has made the experiment,
and started in a small way of business as a housebreaker. For a young
beginner in the burglary line, it was not perhaps a bad idea to set up
at Herne Bay, where the housebreaker finds nearly every house already
broken to his hand; for most of the premises are in an unfinished, and
consequently a broken condition. The Herne Bay burglar proved to
be exceedingly young in his profession, as might have been expected
from the choice he made of his field of enterprise. He had packed up
all the plate, when he was overheard by a female in the house, who
confronted and completely cowed the unfortunate housebreaker. The
poor wretch proved to be in such a weak and pitiable condition—such
a church-mousian state of starvation, that instead of giving him into
custody as a burglar, the woman relieved him with half-a-crown as an
object of charity. He quietly relinquished the spoons, gave up the
whole of his intended booty, and sneaked away with tears of blended
terror and gratitude. -
We are not surprised at the dénouement; but we confess we are asto-
nished and indignant at the absence of the one policeman, who, it is
evident, is quite sufficient, when he is in the way, to defend the Bay
from the milk-sop marauders by whom it is threatened. The one
policeman, had he been attending to his duty, would have warned off
the one burglar, who, it is quite clear, was afraid to say “Bo to a
goose,” and would consequently have been dumbfounded at the sight of
the local unit.
A SEVEN DAYs' Wonden.—A whole week has passed without a
single new Comet being discovered.
“BUTTERED THUNDER.”
In the noble poem of Festus it is alleged against an illustrious
individual, that he looks as though he fed on “buttered thunder ;”
the meaning of which we take to be, that, though his meals are of
thunderbolts, they are served up with a sweet sauce, that in a measure
dulcifies the Vulcanic provender. (“Greased lightning” is a familiar,
household phrase.) Now, MARSHAL BUGEAUD, in his late very soft
address to the Kabyle tribes, does certainly talk as though filled with
“buttered thunder.” He says:—
“I wrote you some days ago, before entering your territory, that I was not coming
to wage war upon you, but merely to drive out of your country El-Hadj ABn-El-Kaden,
and all the other emissaries who were labouring to arm you against us.”
Not a drop of blood was to be shed. No : ABD-EL-RADER was
merely “to be driven out” with a hazel wand or some such hurtless
instrument:—
“It cannot be the will of the Almighty to plunge all Mussulmans in misery, and suffer
them to be partly exterminated, as was already the case in the central and western
districts of your territory.”
It is plain to the sense of MARsh AL ToxNERRE BEURRéE that it is
not the will of Heaven that Mussulmans should be slain and roasted,
and therefore no razzias are committed under his command—no
Caves of Dahra made roaring furnaces to consume hundreds of the
faithful. The Marshal, bowing to the “will of the Almighty,” will
not shed Mussulman blood. But he says–
“Reject from your country Abd-El-Kanºn, BEN SALEM, Bou Chansun, and all the
other ambitious and intriguing men who wish to entail upon you The Horrors of war.
“I declare to you that I will treat as enemies all the tribes who shall have received
and assisted those dangerous men, and that I will respect the territory of all those who
shall not hearken to their fatal counsels.”
How the good man—we are sure of it—must shudder when he talks
of “the horrors of war !” And then how averse must his gentle
spirit be from the ambition and intrigue of ordinary men, he, the
pilgrim Frenchman, the child of civilization, wandered from his belle
France to teach wisdom and loving-kindness to the darkened Arab.
Certainly, pondering on the Marshal's address, it does, to our poetic
sense, appear that genuine mixture is to be henceforth known to pos-
terity as–"buttered thunder.”
NICEIOLAS AND THE NUNS OF MINSK.
E are very happy to apologise to the
EMPERoR Nicholas, having, as it ap-
pears, cast many drops of undeserving
ink upon his Imperial reputation. It
now appears, past doubt, that the
nuns of Minsk and their suffering
abbess have no more existence in
reality than nine out of ten of the
tragic accusations of MR. BusPIELD
FERRAND. They have been nuns got
up for the occasion, like the ghostly
nuns in theatrical white muslim in
Robert the Devil. The cruelties of the
Bishop have no more truth in them
than the cruelties of MR. Hicks, in
the last melodrama of The Blood-
stained Coal-Sack, or, Forty Murders
in Five Minutes/ There has been no
chaining—no whipping—no ill-usage
by that much-scandalized and long-suffering race of men, the Cossacks
—in fact, no nothing.
Now we are very much annoyed at this wilful casting away of wicked
imputations. It was one of the golden maxims of that great man,
JonATHAN WILD, that mischief was too precious a quality to be
wasted. And when we consider the many atrocities that Nicholas
has really to answer for, we do vehemently denounce this attempt to
charge him with the outrage of the nuns, as a most needless and extra-
vagant expenditure of evil. It is adding a useless stripe to the tiger,
an unnecessary spot to the leopard.
Freparations for war.
THE American Government must be in earnest about the Oregon
question, for we have just heard that GENERAL ToM THUMB has
received an order to return immediately to his country to take the
command of the Yankee Army.

DISRAELI, THE SCHOOLMASTER.
“If my hon. friend (FERRAND) will only follow my advice—never to abuse anybody
(immense laughter, and shouts of “Oh t oh!”), and will only give any opinion he has
of public men in language which our English tongue and the forms of this house permit,
he will never be in the position in which he has been unfortunately, and I believe un-
justly, placed.”—DiskARL1, House of Commons, Feb. 28.
Modest merit will make its way. We know that modesty will
not push itself; but then the world is so in love with the quality,
that sometimes it pushes modesty. MR. Dish AELI's late avowal of his
own discreetness of speech—the Hon. Gentleman never talking any-
thing but roses, the points of his eloquence being only the necessary
thorns of the flower—has sunk into the hearts of many loose-tongued
members. Like Master Stephen, they have resolved to be more gentle-
manlike and melancholy, and have therefore prevailed upon the Mem-
ber for Shrewsbury to give them the benefit of his teaching. With
the philanthropy which—like a pulse—beats in every line of Coningsby,
and consequently distinguishes the public life of its author, MR. Dis-
RAELI has consented to give lessons in what he calls the “Abuse-made-
Elegant School.” In pursuit of this design, he has issued the subjoined
prospectus:—
BENJAMIN DISRAELI, M.P. FOR SHREWSBURY,
Benignly begs leave to call the attention of Members of Parliament to
the advantages conferred at his new polite academy, AQUA-FoRTIs
House. He takes in any number of pupils.
MR. Dismaeli's system is calculated to take the dirt out of any
mouth, however foul, and tò fill it with a never-failing supply of sugar-
plums. The DisrAEL1 lozenge, that sweetens any words, however
offensive, is also administered with tremendous success.
MR. DisrAELI's new invention of a process by which abuse, vitu-
peration, in all their degrees and phases—may be administered in
moral capsules of honey and treacle, is patented ; and any infringe-
ment of his right—unless duly paid for—will be visited by one of his
very heaviest motions in Parliament.

An archery ground is attached to Aqua-Fortis House. A figure of
SIR Robert Peel is for the constant use of the pupils, who are in-
structed to shoot envenomed darts at the effigy of the Prime Minis-
ter; the darts being winged with peacock's feathers.
Pupils are also instructed in the use of the globes. MR. DisrAELI
feeling—like a philanthropist and a philosopher—that the world
ought to be newly made, has a terrestrial globe manufactured upon his
own principle. This globe will show what MR. Dish AELI believes to
be the true Oregon boundary ; and pupils will be duly taught its limits
for ensuing debates. -
MR. Disnarli, in evidence of the efficacy of his system, subjoins—
though not without some violence to his modesty—the testimonials of

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A VOICE FROM THE BOUDOIR, ON BERLIN WOOL.
*E are sure the ladies of England are
very glad to hear that SIR. Robert
PEEL, like a good creature, is going
to take off the duty, or tariff, or
whatever it is called, from foreign
lace and Leghorns, and French shoes,
and other things that they are always
wanting. They are charmed with
dear Sir Robert—a duck of a Pre-
mier —for not having all his mind
taken up with that Ireland, and
those Corn Laws, and the stupid
agricultural interest; but for attend-
ing a little to their own interest,
which must be granted to be the
most interesting of any. But there
is one thing that he must do, or else
they shall not like him half so well
as they otherwise should. He posi-
tively must take the tax off Berlin
wool. They regret to learn that he
does not mean to repeal this tax,
because he thinks it a tax on a lux-
ury. Berlin wool a luxury | They
never heard of such a thing. They
grant that pine-apples and other
foreign frui ampagne, Constan-
tia, Noyeau, and wines and liqueurs
of that kind—such a rarity, for instance, as parfait amour-are
luxuries. They will admit that cigars are luxuries, though they
cannot conceive how ; but they never will allow that Berlin wool can
be viewed in that light. They own that they make little elegances out
of it, but if it is to be taxed on that account, they suppose curl-papers
will be taxed next.
Sir Robert should consider what a save it is in a family to have
cushions and stools, and netting for chairs, worked at home. The
ladies hope that he is still enough of protectionist to appreciate the
value of a kettle-holder, marked with the warning, “Mind, it boils "
otherwise they will not be sorry should he burn his fingers for want of
one. Things of this kind, surely, they maintain, are not luxuries, for
what could they do without them 2 So they hope SIR. Robert PEEL
will not be an obstinate and a stupid, but will give up the Berlin wool
tax along with the other plaguy taxes, or else they shall be very
cross with him, and will give him a good scolding.
A TASTE FOR CAPTIVITY.
A DRoll letter was read at the Court of Aldermen, assembled to
talk over the prison affairs of the metropolis. The missive had been
sent to the clergyman of Preston Gaol, and passionately begged a
twelvemonth's taste of the silent system for the writer. He had “got
into a habit of drinking,” and had not resolution enough to discontinue
it, “so long as he was at liberty.” He therefore supplicated that from
a wildfowl, he might be changed into a gaol-bird. He was willing to
pay 20l. for prison-board and lodging ; and further, he proposed
“—to pursue the cold-bathing system with the water supplied to the cell, and the
drinking of cold water also, as recommended by the hydropathic establishments now in
use in England and on the continent."
And he further emphatically declared that “nothing should lure
him from his purpose 1" This letter was heard with much merriment
by the jovial aldermen, especially the part applying to the cold water.
• For ourselves, we receive the missive with great respect for the writer,
and can only wish that his example might be followed. For instance,
suppose a FERRAND or a Roebuck should make like application to
try, for only one session, the silent system—would such request be a
matter for laughter P. Certainly not. On the contrary, with a deep
sense of the obligation to be owed to them, we should beg that the
Gates of the House of Correction might “turn on their harmonious
hinges,” and take them in.

TOO MUCH TROUBLE.
THE newspaper reports from the Western Circuit state that at Win-
chester, the week before last, three soldiers were indicted for assaulting
a woman named Lucy EDMoNDs, and robbing her of half-a-crown, her
property. The first witness proved that the prosecutrix was a married
woman. Whereupon MR. Justice ERLE said, that—
“As the money in the indictment was stated to be the property of Lucy Edmonds,
and it turned out that she was a married woman, the prisoners must be acquitted, because
a married woman could not have half-a-crown of her own."
Now this may seem a very hard case; and it may appear avery easy
matter for the Legislature to pass an enactment rendering the specifi-
cation of the person actually robbed sufficient, in a case of felony, for
the validity of an indictment. But this change in the law is not called
for ; that is, there is no serious danger of an insurrection or a revolu-
tion from its not being adopted ; why, therefore, should ministers take
the trouble to effect it 7
A Fact worth Enowing.
IT is not generally known that the author of those very popular
works entitled, “Etiquette for the Million,” “Etiquette of the Ball
Room, Dinner-Table, &c.,” which have gone through thirteen or
fourteen editions, is MR. BUSFIELD FERRAND, the member for Knares-
borough. We believe he is at present engaged in a great work, to be
called “Etiquette for the House of Commons.”—He is assisted by MR.
RosBuck, the celebrated corrector of the press.

ROSHERWII, I, E: IN GHANCERY.
We congratulate our readers on a glorious prospect of amusement.
In a case before WICE-CHANCELLOR WIGRAM last week, the learned
judge informed the Court that, owing to a suit concerning shares in
Rosherville Gardens, there was a prospect of the Court of Chancery
“appointing a manager to conduct that popular place of amusement,
and by that means taking the Rosherville Gardens into its own hands.”
We congratulate the public : we repeat it. The rich mine of º
entertainment will now be broken up for the first time ; and with
BARon CottºnHAM presiding in the banquet-hall instead of BARon
NATHAN, and a WICE-CHANCELLOR in the crow's-nest of the Maze
instead of the gentleman in green who now does duty there, the whole
place will present attractions hitherto unparalleled. -
We recommend the Company to petition the Court to carry out their
intention. It will increase the value of the Rosherville property ten:
fold. Only think of WICE-CHANCELLOR KNIGHT BRUCE giving legal
oracles from the Gypsy's Tent, and the Maze being transformed inge-
niously into the model of a Chancery suit, in which helpless parties in
the character of suitors might wander up and down without the least
chance of ever finding the way out, even with the aid of one of the
Masters on the pole at the entrance. These officials would occupy this
place in rotation, and thus get a pleasant run once a week from
chamber duties in London.
Thus, instead of SIGNOR JEROME GELLINI ascending the tight-rope
from the lawn to the 'cliff, we might have an exhibition of suitors
balanced on the fine-drawn subtleties of their Counsel; or by way of
extraordinary attraction, Lord CHANCELLOR LYNDHURST might go
through his celebrated feat of running over the longest case without his
notes, as SIGNOR GELLIN1 makes his ascent without a balance-pole.
Then, for the archery practice, we should have the Chancery practice of
shooting cases at random at a stuffed figure of a judge, so constructed
as to fall the moment he was hit in the head by a case in point.
In fact, the diversion we foresee if Rosherville does come under the
management of the Court of Chancery, is endless. Conceive a concert
of disappointed suitors in the music gallery, with a pas frénétique of ago.
nised expectants in the ball-room below. Then what a sublime effect
might be made of the celebrated “Prayer for relief ' " And the WICE-
CHANCELLoR of England might even give his unequalled performance
of issuing a hundred orders in four hours, with ease to himself if not
with satisfaction to his employers. We hope the Court of Chancery
will not hold out such a prospect only to dash it from our longing eyes.
PUNCH'S FABLES.
THE FARMER AND MANY FRIENDs.
HAT is Consistency, a name 2
** Or, rather, an uncertain flame,
North, South, East, West, it blows
about,
Till comes a breeze, which blows
'•' it out.
Who on consistency depends,
In politics, will lose his friends.

friend.
One morning, as asleep he laid,
There came a shouting for Free Trade ;
He hears the League's determin'd cries,
Rolling like thunder through the skies.
He starts, he kicks, he draws his breath,
He sees the Corn-Law doom'd to death.
He trembles at the fearful sound,
And to his friends he hurries round,
To hear what each has got to say,
Before he to despair gives way.
What transport in his bosom grew,
When first his landlord came to view ;
“Let me,” says he, “on you depend,
I know you are the farmer's friend;
Repeal will all our prospects blight,
On land the burden is not light.”
The landlord said, “Poor honest clown,
It grieves my heart to see you down.
Be comforted, relief is near ;
For all our friends are in I hear.”
He next SIB Robert PEEL implor’d,
And thus replied the Cab'net's Lord —
“Since any one alive can tell
That I sincerely wish you well,
I may, without offence, pretend
To take the freedom of a friend.
My Duty calls—the QUEEN, I vow,
Is a complete Free Trader now ;
And when a lady's in the case,
I think I ought to know my place.
To leave you thus may seem unkind,
But see, the Duke is just behind.”
The Duke remark'd that, by the bye,
Opinion's tide ran rather high ;
Though in Protection he'd been school'd,
He thought the country must be rul’d.
The farmer GRAHAM now address'd,
To save a friend so much distress'd.
“I've reach'd,” says he, “too wise an age,
In hopeless contest to engage.
Older and abler pass'd you by,
The Duke and PEEL, and so must I ;
By undertaking your defence,
To them I should but give offence.
Excuse me, then—you know my heart.
But dearest friends, alas I must part.
How shall we all lament 1 Adieu !
For see, the League is just in view.”
The moral of this little tale
To recognise sure none can fail :
To find it any one is able,
At the beginning of the fable.
The bard pursues a novel course,
And puts the cart before the horse.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OU R NATIONAL IDEFENCES.
N the coast we regret to
say that there is not that
activity which should cha-
racterise our arrangements
at the present very critical
period. Brighton, which
is remarkable for its one
artillery man and its four
guns, is at the present mo-
ment in a very perilous
position. The gunner has
given himself up to the
7. arts of peace, and over the
* Artillery Lodge the words
“Apartments Furnished”
are written in conspicuous
characters. Instead of
sponging out his guns he is
devoting himself to the
enervating pursuitofsweep-
ing out his first floor, and preparing it for the reception of the pleasure-
seeking visitor. While he should be keeping his eye on the possible
arrival of an enemy, he is on the look-out for the chance of a lodger.
The fort itself can no longer be said to be manned, for a boy is the sole
and occasional attendant on the battery. The guns, too, are in such
a position, that were they to fire they would have a suicidal effect, two
of them being positively pointed towards the promenade; and Brighton
consequently appears as if, by the aid of its own artillery, it contem-
plated self-destruction.
By the bye, we must compliment the artilleryman on the general
appearance of the ammunition. It is by no means rusty, but shows the
advantage it derives from its being every morning black-leaded, at
the same time as the stove in the Artillery Lodge, or Lodgings, is sub-
mitted to this refreshing process.
PUTNEY BRIDGE.-SUNDAY PENNIES.
TO THE BISHOP OF LONDON.
“Doctor BLoWTFIELD,-Knowing as I do that you are a constant,
indefatigable reader of Punch, I herewith beg a corner in his columns,
in the hope of catching your episcopal eye.
“You, my Lord Bishop, dwell at Fulham, dispensing about you that
peculiar odour of sanctity which, time out of mind, has been the emana-
tion of bishops. Happy are the denizens of Fulham, refined and puri-
fied by your example ! If any people on the face of this populous
earth are better than another, it is the people of Fulham ; so won-
drously have they benefited by the residence of their bishop.
“Therefore is it a matter of much scandal and wonderment that the
moral benefits of your presence should cease and determine, and come
to a full stop at the toll-taker's box of Putney Bridge. Wherefore is
it, gentle Doctor BLoWFIELD, that the owners of that bridge double
the working-day halfpenny on the Sabbath, making Sunday walkers
pay one penny ? Who receives the added halfpenny ? Is it the
be laid on that the poor man may feel how very precious is his Sunday
walk. Perhaps, too, it may be thought that the holiness of the
seventh day is more significantly respected by easing men on that day
of additional coppers.
“And yet is it not so with the Bridge of Waterloo, of South-
wark, of Vauxhall, of Punch's own Hungerford. Wherefore, then,
should hypocritic Putney hold forth its pharisaical paw for a penny
on Sundays, exacting double toll from Sabbath pilgrims ? Why,
of all the bridges with tolls, should Putney Bridge be made to any man

matter—which from this moment must not be suffered to rest until
duly remedied—and at the same time believe me, your Lordship's

LITERARY INTELLIGENCE.
THERE has been published a new periodical called The Horary,
which is a kind of pocket-book, giving, for each day of the year, an
entire page, subdivided into hours, and spaces for the insertion of the
times for rising, dining, &c.; so that a person may tell, before going to
bed, how profitably he has employed his time. A correspondent from
the Temple writes to inform us he has tried the plan now for two
months, with the greatest success, and sends the following page as a

RAILWAY SAUCE FOR GOOSE AND GANDER.
A PROPosAL, it seems, is about to be submitted to Parliament for
taking, in some measure, into its own hands the regulation of the affairs
of railways. Why the line of rail should enjoy a superiority over the
wood-pavement we cannot see, nor yet why the vehicles pertaining to
the one should be subject to a legislation from which those peculiar to
the other are exempt. True omnibus-justice should comprehend all
carriages. Railway officials should be as liable to be “pulled up” for
an overcharge as cabmen ; particularly as they do not generally
differ from cabmen in their manners. It has been proposed, to secure
public safety, that at least one director should H.P. every train.
Perhaps it would be advisable that such director, like a conductor,
should be compelled to wear a badge. For due distinction's sake, it
might be of gold or silver : this would easily make directors known ;
besides which, it would have the great advantage of causing those
gentlemen to know themselves.
The Last New Railway.
.
It is proposed to carry a line of railroad from Poets' Corner round
the interior of Westminster Abbey. Each train will stop half a minute
at the various side chapels, and a minute and a half at HENRY WIL's
Chapel, to enable passengers to view the monuments. The present
conveyances round the Abbey are considered to be too slow, and inca-
pable of holding a sufficient number of passengers, to be consistent with
the convenience of the public. - The fares, too, will be reduced.
N.B.-An express train, warranted to do the distance in half the
time, will be started ten minutes before each of the services.
noPE FOR GIBLETTS.
“THE French papers tell us, that “Monsieur Roland, butcher, at

THE LAST SCENE OF THE MILLER AND HIS MEN.
THE dénouement of the drama of Protection is at length about to arrive, and the
millers, who have for years been in the habit of plundering the people under the
pretence of carrying on a fair trade in corn, must prepare for the coming explosion.
The part of Ravina, who has for some time been an accomplice of the gang, but at
length fires the train which consigns them to destruction, has been undertaken, at
a somewhat short notice, by PEEL, who fills it with considerable ability. The
utter remorselessness with which he proceeds to sacrifice his old comrades must be
considered as a fine touch of dramatic energy, and shows the skill of the consum-
mate artist. GRAHAM, as the gay and inconstant Lothair, though a little too old for
the part, makes up for it exceedingly well, and by the aid of a rapidity of move-
ment, manages to bustle through very amusingly.
Richmond's Grindoff is however one of the finest bits in the drama. The despe-
rate and restless energy with which he clings to the lost cause of his companions
is a triumph of the old school of melodrama. Our artist has ventured on a sketch
of the horrors of the last scene, which we will not weaken by any description of
our own, particularly as the dénouement is one which the course of events will
now very speedily realise.

IF THE EARL of St. GERMANs is desirous of proving that
he really learned something when he was dragged all
over the General Post Office—stood the pelting of the
six o'clock newspapers—was let down upon the movable
floor—was almost smothered in bags, until it took six
stout letter-carriers to effect his delivery—if he will
evince his capacity for his office of Postmaster-General,
he will take a run down to Brighton. The public, misled
by a very flaming announcement, got under the delusion
that because letters are sent six times a day each way be-
tween London and Brighton, there is any quicker corre-
spondence than under the old arrangement. The new plan
gives the letters themselves a few hours' rest, for they are
allowed to lie at the respective post-offices in a sort of otium
cum dignitate, which the authorities do not attempt to dis-
turb by a precipitate delivery. The letters arrive in the
town, it is true; but, as the song says,
“There they lay
All the day
In the Brighton Office, oh!"
For our own 'parts, we are disposed to regard the an-
nouncement of the six posts as “a delusion, a mockery,
and a snare” to draw people down to Brighton under the
idea that they can keep up a frequent and rapid commu-
nication with the metropolis. Letters arriving at 2 P.M.,
4 P.M., and 5 P.M., are kept until they can go out in
company with those arriving at past 6 P.M., and they
are all delivered together at about * past 7.
The only satisfaction one feels from the early arrival is,
the pleasant consciousness that a letter which reached
Brighton at 2, has been waiting 54 hours in a state of
coma at the post-office. We are disposed to regard the
whole affair as a ruse, to divide the labour of the post-
office people, by getting the letters in six small instalments
instead of their pouring in all at once, and requiring
some little activity to have them sorted ready for delivery.
In London, of course nobody expects to get a letter
until several hours after the proper period. The nearer
the place the longer the time taken in communication, is
the principle of the Post-office. Thus, if it takes eight
hours to hear from Brighton, it follows that it will require
ten to get a letter from Hammersmith. And so on in
proportion, until a letter sent from one part of London
to another stands some chance of never reaching its des-
tination. “As deaf as a post” is a proverb, which no
doubt took its origin from the post-office people being
so very hard of hearing when the public voice is calling
attention to some grievance that requires a remedy,
THE VICAR AND THE POET.
IT appears from the Bristol Journal that some six years
ago a monument to CHATTERton was erected in Redcliff
churchyard, Bristol. The Rev. MARTIN WHish was, it
seems, desirous that the stone should bear certain lines of
the best morality “which the vicar's scrap-book could
furnish.” Time, however, rolled on, when, a little while
since, the Rev. MARTIN WHish, after six years' toleration
of the monument to the “marvellous boy,” the poet
suicide, the overwrought lunatic, bethought himself that
the monument was a wrong, an eyesore to a Christian
place of sepulture, and had it removed. This bigotry
towards the illustrious dead is quite worthy of the spirit
of Bristol exercised toward the living. The city helped
to starve the genius; and now comes the vicar, in the
year of light and liberality 1846, to wreak his sacerdotal
spite (and there is no mischief like it) on the memory of
the truly great and truly unfortunate.
The Theatre of War.
ALGERIA is frequently mentioned in the French
papers as the “theatre of war.” We must say the
principal actors understand their business very well, as
their engagements now have lasted for the last fourteen
years; but then it must be confessed the acting directions
are very easy, for they consist absolutely of nothing else
but “Enter ABD-El-KADER ; Ecit Bugeaud :” and “Exit
ABD-El-KADER ; Enter Bugeaud.”

AN ACT FOR THE ABOLITION OF “HANSARD.”
WE have determined, for good reasons, to draw a bill, which we beg
SIR Robert PEEL, the Cabinet, and the Parliamentary converts to
Free Trade at large, to accept. We shall not trouble them with this
little bill ; unlike little bills in general, it is calculated to give them
pleasure, and no doubt they will gladly pass it. Here it is :—
“CRHI) creas it is expedient that on divers subjects, topics, and prin-
ciples of legislation, Members of Parliament shall, upon rational con-
viction, or on other grounds or inducements which need not here be
alluded to, change and alter their minds, speak and vote contrarily to
their former professions, and veer and turn about in such manner as
shall to them seem good and convenient ; and that without let, moles-
tation, or hindrance : AND where.As, when disposed to make such
change, the fear and dread of being twitted with inconsistency, and
subjected unto irony, sarcasm, and ridicule on account thereof, is a
serious let, a grievous molestation, and a strong hindrance to the
accomplishment of this their design : AND FURTHER, Whereas any
record or document containing and setting forth their said former pro-
fessions, and the speeches, declarations, or votes, which they have made
or given in time past, doth help and enable any evil or maliciously dis-
posed person or persons so to twit and ridicule them, and overwhelm
them with sarcasm and irony : AND where.As during a late debate
numerous and several honourable members have been, after this fashion,
by that kind of persons, twitted, ridiculed, and sarcastically and ironi-
cally reviled, to their great annoyance and discomfiture, and to the
infliction on them of a heavy blow and a great discouragement, by
reason whereof they are well nigh unable to show their faces :
“%Int, Iagtip, Q&Ibercas there existeth a certain record or document
of Parliamentary Debates, commonly called Hansard, which unhappily
hath furnished the means and occasion of citing, quoting, raking up,
and casting in their teeth their former speeches, votes, and declara-
tions aforesaid, and which, if it continue to exist and be in being, will
afford a like handle on future similar occasions, which may be confl-
dently expected to occur : Now, in order to prevent and render
impossible hereafter for ever such injurious and vexatious revival of
things past, to the discomfort and detriment of honourable members,
and in particular to the affixing on them of the odious nickname of
Rat; and also for their encouragement in the due and fitting change
of their opinions: -
“33e it therefore Cºmartetſ; and it is hereby enacted, That the said
record , or document of Parliamentary proceedings called Hansard
be forthwith, altogether, and entirely suppressed, discontinued, abro-
gated, and utterly abolished ; sufficient and reasonable compensation
to the printers thereof having been rendered.”
ERRATUM.
. In the new edition of the “Parliamentary Companion,” which sub-
joins all the clubs to which Honourable Members belong, it is proposed
to read “Coalhole” instead of “Carlton,” after LoRD NorthLAND's
maine.
THE LAST DUKE.
ALL selfishness must meet its doom ;
Humbug itself must die,
Before the Dukes give us their room
'Stead of their company.
I saw a vision in my sleep,
Of Tamboff corn, a fearful heap,
And Belgian cattle prime :-
I saw the last of #. race,
Who in the steamer took his place,
To seek a foreign clime.
His Grace had quite a bilious air;
His cheek with woe was wan;
The Ducal glories center'd were,
All in that lonely man
Some had gone to Boulogne—the hands
Of mortgagees were on their lands—
To Rome and Baden some ;
The House of Peers was drear and dead,
And Punch himself as dull as lead,
Now that the Dukes were dumb.
Yet, donkey-like, that lone one stood,
In seediness still high,
And, turning on the pier of wood,
To England gave good bye ;
Saying, “Thou hast set, my country's sun 1
Thou may'st shut up—the thing is done;
The Dukes are forc’d to go ;
The Corn Laws, that for eighteen years
Have kept up rents and paid the Peers,
Have fallen at a blow !
“What tho' beneath them we had dearth,
And no reward for skill ?
What tho’ the tillers of the earth
Their bellies ne'er could fill P
Henceforth, to men in toil grown grey,
The new coat with its buttons gay,
No Ducal hand imparts—
Henceforth no Duke shall teach the throng,
With curry-powder warm and strong,
To cheer the labourers' hearts.
“But I, for one, won't vote supplies
To men who thus conspire
To lower the Duke in vulgar eyes,
And poke fun at the Squire.
* I quit my country, doomed to death ;
Hard soil, where first I drew my breath,
Where long I ruled the roast ;
I'll take the Corn-Laws for a pall,
And, wrapping them around me, fall—
Wept by the Morning Post/
“Go, John—the steam will soon be up,
A sandwich I would taste ;
I shall be too sea-sick to sup—
Unto Sir Robert, haste ;
Tell that man to his brazen face,
Thou saw'st the last of Ducal race
Quitting this classic spot,
PEEL and Potato-blight defy
To make him hold his tongue, or try
To talk aught else but ‘rot l’”
DEPARTURES FROM THE METROPOLIS,
THE Giant and the Dwarf, and the Boa-constrictor, have all left
High Holborn, where they have paid taxes for so many years. The
Wax-work exhibition has gone with them, and the tide of population,
as it runs past the door, is no longer interrupted in its onward
º the gong of the beef-eater, or the organ of Lady Jane Grey,
who used to take the money with one hand, and play “You’ll
remember me,” with the other.
The celebrated “Original Bear Shop,” opposite St. Giles's Church,
has likewise left the Metropolis, and gone—the proprietor only knows
where. The popular fresco of NELsos fighting a broadsword combat
with six polar bears, which had weathered the fog and the rain over
the balcony ever since 1833, has also “walked its chalks.” It is
rumoured that it has retired into private life, for the purpose of being
engraved for the Art-Union. If this be true, we congratulate the
subscribers upon their getting an engraving at last, the subject of
which it may be possible to understand.

T H E S N OBS OF EN G LAN D.
BY ONE OF THEMSELVES.
CHAPTER IV.
“THE COURT CIRCULAR,” AND ITS INFLUENCE ON SNOBS.
x AMPLE is the best of
precepts; so let us
begin with a true
and authentic story,
showing how young
aristocratic Snobs
are reared, and how
early their Snobbish-
ness may be made to
bloom. A beautiful
and fashionable lady
—(pardon, gracious
Madam, that your
story should be made
public ; but it is so
moral that it ought
to be known to the
universal world)—
told me that in her
early youth she had
a little acquaintance,
who is now indeed a beautiful and fashionable lady too. In mentioning Miss
SNoBKY, daughter of SIR SNoBBY SNoBKY, whose presentation at Court caused
such a sensation last Thursday; need I say more ?
When Miss SNoBKY was so very young as to be in the nursery regions, and to
walk of early mornings in St. James's Park, protected by a French governess and
followed by a huge hirsute flunky in the canary-coloured livery of the SNoBKYs,
she used occasionally in these promenades to meet with young LoRD CLAUDE LOLLI-
Pop, the MARQUIs of SILLABUB's younger son. In the very height of the season,
from some unexplained cause, the SNoBKYs suddenly determined upon leaving town.
Miss SNoBKY spoke to her female friend and confidante. “What will poor CLAUDE
LoLLIPOP say when he hears of my absence?” asked the tender-hearted child.
“O, perhaps he won't hear of it,” answers the confidante.
“My dear, he will read it in the papers,” replied the dear little fashionable rogue of
seven years old. She knew already her importance, and how all the world of
England, how all the would-be-genteel people, how all the silver-fork worshippers,
how all the tattle-mongers, how all the grocers' ladies, the tailors' ladies, the attor-
neys' and merchants' ladies, and the people living at Clapham and Brunswick
Square, who have no more chance of consorting with a SNoBKY, than my beloved
reader has of dining with the Emperor of China—yet watched the movements of
the SNoBKYs with interest, and were glad to know when they came to London and
left it.
Here is the account of Miss SNoBKY's dress, and that of her mother LADY
SNoBKY, from the papers of last Friday:—
“Miss SNOBKY.
“Habit de Cour, composed of a yellow nankeen illusion dress over a slip of rich
pea-green corduroy, trimmed en tablier, with bouquets of Brussels sprouts : the
body and sleeves handsomely trimmed with calimanco, and festooned with a pink
train and white radishes. Head dress, carrots and lappets.
“LADY snobky.
“Costume de Cour, composed of a train of the most superb Pekin bandannas,
elegantly trimmed with spangles, tinfoil, and red-tape. Bodice and underdress of
sky-blue velveteen, trimmed with bouffants and nouds of bell-pulls. Stomacher,
a muffin. Head-dress, a bird's nest, with a bird of paradise, over a rich brass
knocker en ferronière. This splendid costume, by MADAME CRINoLINE, of Regent
Street, was the object of universal admiration.”
This is what you read. O, Mrs. Ellis' O, mothers, daughters, aunts, grand-
mothers of England, this is the sort of writing which is put in the newspapers for
you ! How can you help being the mothers, daughters, &c., of Snobs, so long as
this balderdash is set before you ?
You stuff the little rosy foot of a Chinese young lady of fashion into a slipper
that is about the size of a salt-cruet, and keep the poor little toe there imprisoned
and twisted up so long that the dwarfishness becomes irremediable. Later the foot
would not expand to the natural size were you to give her a washing-tub for a
shoe, and for all her life she has little feet, and is a cripple. O, my dear Miss W1G-
GINs, thank your stars that those beautiful feet of yours—though I declare when
you walk they are so small as to be almost invisible—thank your stars that society
never so practised upon them, but look around and see how many friends of ours
in the highest circles have had their brains so prematurely
and hopelessly pinched and distorted.
How can you expect that those poor creatures are to
move naturally when the world and their parents have
mutilated them so cruelly As long as a Court Circular
exists, how the deuce are people whose names are chro-
nicled in it ever to believe themselves the equals of the
cringing race which daily reads that abominable trash 2
I believe that ours is the only country in the world now,
where the Court Circular remains in full flourish—where
you read, “This day His Roy AL HIGHNEss PRINCE PAT-
TYPAN was taken an airing in his go-cart.” “The PRIN-
CEss PIMMINY was taken a drive, attended by her ladies
of honour and accompanied by her doll,” &c. We laugh
at the solemnity with which SAINT SIMON announces that
Sa Majesté se médicamente aujourdhui. Under our very
noses the same folly is daily going on. That wonderful
and mysterious man, the author of the Court Circular,
drops in with his budget at the newspaper offices every
night. I once asked the Editor of a paper to allow me to
lie in wait and see him.
I am told that in a kingdom where there is a German
King-Consort (Portugal it must be, for the QUEEN of that
country married a little German Prince, who is greatly
admired and respected by the natives), whenever the
Consort takes the diversion of shooting among the rab-
bit-warrens of Cintra, or the pheasant-preserves of Mafra,
he has a keeper to load his guns, as a matter of course,
and then they are handed to the nobleman, his equerry,
and the nobleman hands them to the Prince, who blazes
away—gives back the discharged gun to the nobleman,
who gives it to the keeper, and so on. But the Prince
won't take the gun from the hands of the loader.
As long as this unnatural and monstrous etiquette con-
tinues, Snobs there must be. The three persons engaged
in this transaction are, for the time being, Snobs.
1. The keeper—the least Snob of all, because he is dis-
charging his daily duty ; but he appears here as a Snob,
that is to say, in a position of debasement, before another
human being, (the German Prince,) with whom he is only
allowed to communicate through another party. A free
Portuguese game-keeper, who confesses himself to be un-
worthy to communicate directly with any person, con-
fesses himself to be a Snob.
2. The nobleman in waiting is a Snob. If it degrades
the German Prince to receive the gun from the game-
keeper, it is degrading to the nobleman in waiting to
execute that service. He acts as a Snob towards the
keeper, whom he keeps from communication with the
Prince—a Snob towards the Prince, to whom he pays
a degrading homage.
3. The King-Consort of Portugal is a Snob for insulting
fellow-men in this way. There's no harm in his accept-
ing the services of the keeper directly ; but indirectly
he insults the service performed, and the two servants
who perform it; and therefore, I say respectfully, is a
most undoubted, though royal SN–B.
And then you read in the Diario do Goberno—“Yes-
terday, His Majesty, the king, took the diversion of
shooting in the woods of Cintra, attended by Colo-
NEL the HoNour ABLE WHisKERANDo SoMBRERo. His
Majesty returned to the Necessidades to lunch, at, &c., &c.”
Oh, that Court Circular ! once more, I exclaim. Down
with the Court Circular—that engine and propagator
of Snobbishness: I promise to subscribe for a year to
any daily paper that shall come out without a Court
Circular—were it the Morning Herald itself. When I
read that trash, I rise in my wrath ; I feel myself disloyal,
a regicide, a member of the Calf's Head Club. The
only Court Circular story which ever pleased me, was
that of the King of Spain, who in great part was
roasted because there was not time for the Prime Minister
to command the Lord Chamberlain to desire the Grand
Gold Stick to order the first page in waiting to bid the
chief of the flunkies to request the Housemaid of Honour
to bring up a pail of water to put His Majesty out.

I am like the Pasha of three tails, to whom the Sultan sends his
Court Circular, the bowstring.
It chokes me.
May its usage be abolished for ever !
FORENSIC SinGING.
WE perceive that classes are being formed in the Temple, for the pur-
pose of teaching some of the members of the legal profession to sing,
in the intervals of business. Considering the brieflessness that prevails
in some of the Temple districts, we think that occupation is much
wanted ; though we doubt whether the legal mind will be disposed to
devote itself much to harmony. There is a Solitary, in Hare Court,
who sends forth from his melancholy flute the tones of sadness; and
there is a lively Utter, in an adjacent part of the Temple, who plays
Polkas, “from morn till dewy eve,” on a cracked piano. These “great
facts” prove that the Temple is prepared to receive a singing-master
with open arms, and we are glad that one has at length presented him-
self. The only difficulty now will be in finding a poet worthy of the
forensic vocalists. We shall have much pleasure in furnishing the
classes with occasional snatches of song, for we think the plan deserves
encouragement. We have already seen a junior sofar advanced that he
is able to hum “Marble Halls,” with the slight omission of the final
trill, and leaving out some of the more difficult “accidents” in the
melody.
Several of the Benchers are at work arranging programmes of legal
concerts and chamber music. We subjoin one of these interesting
documents:—
33rogramme.
“Plead thou my cause.” { Suitors and Solicitor-
General.
Mr. Austen and two rival
Railway Companies.
Attorneys of the Court.
ſ By a body of Provisional
l Committee Men.
Chorus AND Solo . . . .
SoNG AND Chorus . . . ſ “How happy could I be }
l with either.”
Comic ARIA “Fi-Fa."
GRAND Chorus “We fly by night.”
Suitors in the Common
SYMPHoNY IN A PLAT . . . . . . . . . . . .
Pleas.
“All in the Downs.”
Serjeants in the Common
{ Pleas.
We would recommend that cases and indictments should be stated in
plain recitative ; the airs being kept in reserve for the pleadings. And
what pleading can be more eloquent than that of music * The magic
of melody will be most beautifully adapted to express what counsel so
often complain that mere words will not express—the feelings of the
plaintiff in a breach of promise of marriage.
We can fancy her advocate bewailing, in a tender andante, the
crushed heart of the deserted one ; and then bursting suddenly into an
indignant bravura, to denounce the perfidy of the defendant. We can
also imagine the light allegro wherein the opposite barrister derides his
learned friend's pathos. Then, too, we can conceive an altercation be-
tween the two, carried on in a lively duet. It is a pity that juries can
hardly be rendered musical ; because a verdict would be a capital sub-
ject for a fugue, as expressive of unanimity.
Judges, we hope, will henceforth be chosen, in part at least, for their
voice, which should properly be a deep bass, to enable them, in passing
sentence, to deliver with due solemnity the awful thunders of the Law.
In compliance with our promise to furnish an occasional piece of
poetry, we beg leave to throw off the following little solo for chamber
practice.
Arn—“Marble Halls.”
I dreamt that I stood in Westminster Hall,
With KELLY and SHEE on my side;
And of all who did argue within those walls,
That I was the Barristers' pride.
I'd motions too many to count, could boast
Of a fee in every suit;
But I also dreamt, which pleased me most,
That I got my rule to compute.
I dreamt that attorneys sought my aid,
That firms of a high degree,
Came all the way up to my chambers, and paid
Some enormous unheard-offee.
And I dreamt that one of that useful host
Came up, as I play'd my flute;
But I also dreamt, which pleas'd memost,
That he brought me a rule to compute.
PUNCH'S POLITICAL DICTIONARY.
AIR. So called from the general
unfairness of the transactions
carried on at fairs, at least in
the vicinity of London. Manu-
factured giants raised on con-
cealed stilts ; dwarfs on their
knees, with a cloth thrown over
their legs to cover the decep-
tion ; pig-faced ladies, made of
wax ; horses with six legs, two |
of them most palpably tied on
with a piece of twine; Indian
savages, with complexions made
of lamp-black, and hair of the
most indisputable worsted;
conjuring by wizards, who bor-
row half-crowns and really cause
them to “fly, pass,” so cleverly
that they never come back
again, are a few of the charac-
teristics of the “fair” pro-
ceedings in the neighbourhood
of the metropolis. There is a
great Book Fair every year at
Leipsic, which is resorted to by
all the booksellers in Germany.
There is some idea of starting a similar fair in England, at which
some of the publishers would attend with caravans full of literary lions
subdued by kind and gentle treatment. The lions of Punch will, on
that occasion, be exhibited “Alive I Alive : " and the public will be
invited to “walk up, walk up,” for they will be told they are “now
in time” for the very attractive exhibition.
FEDERATION. A sort of union of several foreign states under one
government, like that of the United States of America. The result of
this sort of union is a constant division, and the United States are
incessantly quarrelling.
- FEUDAL SYSTEM. This system is one of the earliest specimens of
that folly and tyranny, which until very lately used to go under the
name of the “wisdom of our ancestors.” By the feudal system, a
landlord who had granted an estate could coolly take it back again,
which was called a feud : probably because there was a disturbance
or a row, when the tenant was called upon to hand it over.
The etymology of the word feud has of course been the subject of
much absurd speculation among the old jurists. Some have had a
touch at the Teutonic, others have dashed into the Danish, while the |
Saxon and Swedish have both contributed their quota of conglomera-
tion and mystery. After a great deal of knocking about and melting
down in the crucible of antiquarianism, we find the word feud spun
out into Emphyteusis, which is declared to be synonymous with Pre-
caria, meaning an estate of precarious and uncertain tenure. Feuds
originated with the custom of handing over to a vassal a part of the
spoil acquired in conquest, so that the landlord was a mere thief—from
which perhaps we get the word fief—and the tenant a receiver of
stolen goods, knowing them to be stolen. The vassal was in those
days a sort of valet, which no doubt is derived from vassal, by one of

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
those verbal transmogrifications in which the antiquarians delight ;
and the valet was so called because he got value—vulgarly called
vally—for his services. These definitions may be rather vague, but
they are at all events quite as near the mark as those we find in autho-
rities of higher pretension. The feudal system reached its maturity
at the time of the Norman Conquest, when the whole kingdom
became a fief, or perhaps we should rather say a fife, that was played
upon to a pretty tune by the Conqueror.
FIELD MARshAL. A very high military dignity, conferred on
commanders of armies distinguished for their valour or ability. PRINCE
ALBERT is a Field Marshal, and so is the DUKE of WELLINGTON.
His Royal Highness has not commanded an army, but he has shown
his military talent by the invention of a hat, and his courage by
having not shrunk from avowing himself as the author of it. There
are only six British Field Marshals, three of whom are foreign sove-
reigns—namely, the Kings of Holland, Hanover, and Belgium. The
only English representative of the highest military achievement be-
sides the DUKE of WELLINGton, is His Roy AL HIGHNEss of CAM-
BRIDGE, who has led thousands to the full charge, on many occasions,
when calling on the company of which he has been at the head to
charge—their glasses at the public dinner table.
For Est LAws. “These laws are so old, that we do not know the
beginning of them,” says CoRE; but we are happy to say that we have
pretty well seen the end of them. By the old Forest Laws, the deer
was held dearer than man ; for it was more penal to kill the former
than the latter. If the Forest Laws were now in force, they might
afford some protection to the numerous old bucks who, in the capacity
of railway directors' stags, have got themselves entangled in sundry
very disagreeable branches.
PUNCH'S REVIEW.
Railway Correspondence of a Stag, being a series of Letters addressed to
an Allottee in numerous Railroads during the years 1845 and 1846.
London : 4to, pp. 9086.
His extremely voluminous correspond-
ence—if that, indeed, can be called a
correspondence, which was nearly all
on one side—is a portion of the great
result of the railway bubble mania
of 1845, when every shop-boy dealt in
scrip, and paupers were undertaking
to provide millions for the construction
of lines from every corner of the
earth to every habitable hole on the
face of it. The reader must not expect
in this series of letters to find all the
point which Horace threw into his
epistles ; he must not look for all the
elegance of a CHESTERFIELD, all the chaste correctness of a Mrs.
CHAPONE, nor all the sensibility of a MADAME DE SEVIGNE ; but a
fair sprinkling of these qualities combined, a sort of pot pourri of
every epistolary style may be fairly promised to any one who will
examine the correspondence of our Stag in a spirit of candour and
tolerance.
It has been feelingly said by some anonymous sophist, whose name
we have been unable to catch, that mere correspondence could never
lead to familiarity; but this position we are prepared to deny, after
having perused the growing freedom towards our Stag, which gradu-
ally arose out of a succession of letters from the same quarter having
been addressed to him. Let us take the first letter from the Falmouth
and Fulham Junction Railway, with branches to Turnham Green and
Tadcaster, with ultimate extension to Shepherd's Bush and Shrewsbury.
What can be more stiff, formali and even unfriendly than the tone of
the letter of allotment, written in the moment of pride, pomp, and dig-
nity, when the bubble, blown out to its fullest extent, reflected the
brilliant but evanescent glories of a thousand prismatic premiums ?
What can be more cold and haughty than the following passage,
which, in its stiff classicality, brings back the days of PLAurus, or
reminds us of the almost insulting preciseness of Pliny, when address-
ing to his friend the memorable words—“I have sent the book, accord-
ing to your command. I should have sentitif you had not commanded
me.” But no less rude and unattractive is the observation in the letter
of the J. T. T. S. and S. Railway Committee to our Stag, on his first
being favoured with a communication from that very remarkable
company. “The deposit must be paid on or before Saturday next, or
the allotment will be absolutely void, and the shares disposed of to
other applicants.” What I not a single day's grace 2 No! not an
hour. The haughty provisional directors of the W. T. T., &c., &c., must
have the deposits instantly paid, as the condition of their graciously
allotting some ten out of a hundred shares applied for by those
mimium fortunati, the Stags, whose requests have been partially
attended to.
But soon a less rigid tone is adopted towards the cervine applicant.
The bubble has in the mean time burst, the deposit is not paid, and
the Stag, who is not particularly anxious to connect Shrewsbury with
Shepherd's Bush, or facilitate the communication between Tadcaster
and Turnham Green, gives himself no more trouble about the scheme,
for the success of which he had been formerly solicitous. This brings
us to a new phase in the correspondence, for the panic has begun to
take the starch out of the provisional committee-men, who had formerly
been as full of that material as the potato itself, and there is every
symptom of the bursting of the bubble being likely debellare superbos
to a degree that is really wonderful. Our Stag's correspondence now
contains a letter jogging his memory upon his, having omitted to pay
his deposit, and kindly intimating that the time has been extended for
his doing so. Here we get a little of the admonitory style of CHAPonE,
which is followed in the next epistle by a fine specimen of politeness,
reminding us of some of the most polite and courteous passages of
CHESTERFIELD. The stag is now “requested" to pay the deposit to a
banker, within a certain period, and confidence is usually expressed in
his feeling himself bound in honour to complete his part of the implied
contract between himself and the provisional committee-men. It is now,
for the first time, that our Stag, touched no doubt by this appeal to his
better attributes, at length sends a written reply, in which honour
and conciseness are conspicuous. As it is the first letter of the series
from the Stag's own pen, we give it entire.
“GENTLEMEN,
“I wish you may get it. “Yours,” &c.
There is evidently a struggle between benevolence and beneficence
on the part of the writer. He wishes the provisional committee may
get the deposit, but he does nothing to put them in possession of it.
Pursuing the correspondence on this subject, we find the amiable
wish of the Stag by no means taken in the same spirit that dictated it.
The reply to his communication shows a relapse on the part of the
company into the original state of stiffness in which they were when
they first addressed the Stag when allotting him some shares as a
special act of favour. To the early hauteur, however, is now added a
decided menace, with which, however, an almost latent humour is
interwoven ; for, after a threat of proceedings, he is comically required
to furnish the name of his solicitor, with a view to the commencement
of a suit in equity. There is something provokingly piquant in a
provisional committee of a bubble railway talking about equity in
connection with their project. Law might have been hinted at without
exciting any very violent notion of fun ; but a railway committee
talking about equity, creates an incongruity of the most ludicrous |
character.
We must now close these entertaining letters, which we do with the
following analysis of their general contents, gathered from some five
hundred epistles written by the secretaries of about three hundred
different railways. Confidence in the Stag's honour seemed to have
existed in the proportion of about one per cent.; appeals to his
generosity were very nearly four-tenths of the whole ; threats
constituted one-sixth ; and the rest of the letters may be classed under
the head of miscellaneous, in which bullying, however, seems to pre-
ponderate. It might be interesting to carry still further the investi-
gation into this remarkable phase of our history. We might ascertain
how many of the stag-population responded to the claims on their
honour; how many were assailable through their fears; and how many
found in their sleeves a receptacle for that laughter in which they
could not openly indulge themselves. We fear the number of the
latter would far exceed that of all the other classes together.
PREPARATIONS AT THE ADMIRALTY.
Lond ELLENBorough, in his capacity of First Lord of the Admi-
ralty, has sent round a general order to all the metropolitan rag and
bottle shops, desiring them to keep up their complement of marine
| stores to the very highest point that circumstances will admit of.
| His Lordship has also caused instructions to be forwarded to all the
principal London bakers to keep a quantity of captain's biscuits always
in readiness.
Relieving Guard.
Forty peasants have recently ascended the highest Pyramid. This
act of fortitude must have been for the charitable purpose of relieving
the “forty sentries” who, according to NAPoleoN, have been looking
down for ages from the top of the Pyramids.

THE PROBABLE EFFECT OF CHEAP FURNITURE HUMBUG.
“Oh ' If You Please, MistER, ME AND THIs YouNG Aw-Aw-INDIVIDUAL is About to
MARRY ; AND we want to look over Your Cheap FURNITURE MART.”
THE CIVIL WAR IN THE CITY.
THIs deadly struggle is at an end. The City authorities
have ceded the Blackfriars territory, or at least consented
to a joint occupation by themselves and the Watermen.
Paul's Wharf remains in the hands of the latter, the right
: visit being allowed to the civic police at reasonable
ours.
Waterman, No. 6, gave a poloni lunch on board his vessel,
in celebration of the peace having been concluded. The
health of the captain was drunk, with the constitutional
addition, “and may he never forget the principles which
placed him on the British paddle-box 1" Among the other
toasts, was “The stoker, the true source of legitimate
power ſ” The policeman and the mate smoked the cheroot
of peace, and played the cribbage of reconciliation together
in the evening on the fore part of the vessel. We believe
that an early day is to be appointed for the Lord Mayor
and the Captain to blow the cloud of oblivion over their
past difference.
The civic consul still remains at Blackfriars Pier; and
an effective force of two beadles is to be kept up as a sort
of army of occupation—with nothing to do—for the next
twelve months.
The Yankee Press.
AN American paper says of the singer TEMPLETON :—
“He has given great offence to the New York Press by the exposure of
Should he return there, a considerable excitement will be raised against

And, unless the press be bought for 50 dollars, the faithful
Mirror will be against them ; and the humbug of the New
York Press in general be greatly offended at the “exposure”
of the scoundrel venality!
THE “DUKE” AND HIS AUTOGRAPH.
FIELD MARSHAL THE DURE of WEL-
LINGTON.—although he beat NApo-
LEoN–is a simple, ingenuous soul,
continually duped by a gang of ladies
and gentlemen and others who—with
a morbid taste for ink and paper—
pursue men of mark for their auto-
graphs.
As the DUKE is known to answer
every letter—no matter its import—
addressed to him, all kinds of epistles
are sent him, for the sole purpose of
drawing His Grace of his autograph.
We have seen many of the Duke's
answers, and give a few.
“FIELD-MARSHAL THE DUKE of
WELLINGtoN informs MICHAEL WIg-
GINs that the coat he wore on the
field of Waterloo was not the original model of the present D'Orsay
paletot. The CoMTE D'ORs.AY is much too honourable a man to steal
anything from the DUKE of WELLINGTON, or—as the Duke firmly
believes—from anybody else.”
“The DUKE OF WELLINGTON desires PETER SNout to take note that
he is Commander-in-Chief of the army, and not a hatter. Therefore
it is not the Duke's business to see that the wig of the statue of
GEORGE THE FourTH, Trafalgar Square, should be covered.”
“FIELD-MARSHAL THE DUKE of WELLINGToN has received JoHN
Jones's letter. The late Duke of York's debts may be paid, and they
may not. The DUKE of WELLINGTON informs John Jones that he
shall not pay them.”
And in this shameful manner is the courtesy of the noble Duke
every day played upon. The Irish papers give the last instance of
these intrusions upon his Grace's time, with, of course, the answer it
a private letter from a gentleman connected with the Mirror, soliciting 50
dollars from him for favourable notices of his concerts whilst in that city.
him. No performers or singers can thrive in this country with the press
provoked. Somebody called the Duke's attention to the new cotton
shirts adopted by the Army, and to the potato-sickness. The Duke
went at once into the shirts, but would not touch the potatoes :—
“Upon the other parts of MR. —'s letter, that is, the state of distress existing in the
neighbourhood of —, consequent on what is called the potato disease, the Duke of ,
WELLINGToN begs leave to suggest to MR. — that he is the Commander-in-Chief of the
army.”
And therefore, as MR. ought to have known, is not called upon
to cry “eyes right” to the potatoes. But MR. already knew as
much. All he wanted was the Duke's autograph, and he got it.
PRUSSIAN NIGHTINGALES.
A recent Berlin Police Order decrees that “every person in Prussia
who keeps a nightingale in a cage, shall pay an annual tax of 10 thalers
(40 francs), and that any person putting a nightingale in future into a
cage, without giving information to the police, shall be fined 30 thalers.”
This measure is to guarantee as much as possible, liberty to nightingales.
When will his Prussian Majesty grant the same freedom to Prussian
poets?
The Hero of a Hundred Broadsides.
It is in contemplation to let the four sides of the hoarding round the
Nelson column to celebrated bill-stickers. Thus one side will be
leased to MR. WEBstER, another to MR. BUNN, a third to JULLIEN, and
the fourth will be shared by Moses, the Adelaide Gallery, Parr's Life
Pills, and the minor theatres. By these means it is calculated a suffi-
cient sum of money will be collected in less than ten years to give the
melancholy column a decent pedestal.
THE FUSILEER GOATS.
HER MAJESTY, we learn, has given to the Welsh Fusileers—inconso-
lable for the loss of their venerable Cambrian Billy-goat, he was such
a “sweet William”—a couple of milk-white Cashmere goats. “Goats :
goats | " cried SIBTHoRPE, “why not instead of goats, give them bat-
tering-rams ?”

NEW SCIENTIFIC APPOINTMENTS AT CAMBRIDGE.
It is a common against our two Universities, that their
system of education has too little reference to praetical utility, and is
insufficiently adapted to promote that wide state of wakefulness
required by the circumstances of modern society. The almost exclu-
sively classical and mathematical studies in which it consists, are va-
riously stigmatised as musty, fusty, rusty, monastic, and obsolete ; and
the collegiate schoolmaster is said to be abroad in the sense of being
astray. To this objection, certainly, Cambridge has been less open than
Oxford ; but the late Gown and Town riots at the former seat of
learning, suggest a palpable defect in its provisions for the tutorage of
Young England.
A few of the natural sciences are taught at Cambridge ; but in that
science which is the most natural of any, and which at all events, as
has been proved, comes most naturally to gownsmen, no instruction is
afforded. We allude to the science of pugilism, of which branch of
useful knowledge there is not a chair in the University. Cambridge
has many Masters of Arts, but it does not recognise a single Master of
the noble Art of Self-defence. It has plenty of foundations for sizars,
but not one foundation for bruisers. There are various exhibitions at
Cambridge, but they include no exhibitions of sparring—except those
which take place in the public streets ; to the questionable credit of
the parties concerned in them.
It has wranglers, and it has also fighters ; but the former are
persons who take honours, whilst the latter obtain no honour at all.
Of course all young men should be prepared to fight their way through
the world ; and if it is necessary that under-graduates should also
fight their way along the pavement, surely they ought to be taught
that too. If pugilism is to be practised at Cambridge, let it also be
studied. Let one of the circles of collegiate science be the prize-ring.
This line of argument has appeared to the University authorities so
demonstrative, that we understand a BENDIGo Professorship is forth-
with to be established at Trinity; and there is also to be a CAUNT
Professor at John's. A SPRING Lectureship, we hear, will be likewise
endowed at Peterhouse, and to King's will be appointed a TIPTON-
SLASHERIAN Lecturer. Owen Swift, JEM BURN, and ALIck REID
Scholarships will be founded at Queen's, Pembroke, and Magdalene.
At every College there is to be at least one fistic fellowship ; to be
vacated, of course, on accepting church preferment.
It is further intended to create a new kind of degrees, namely, B.M.,
or Bachelor of Milling; M.B., or Master of Boxing ; and D.D., or
Doctor, not of Divinity, but of Drubbing. The possession of this latter
degree will, we are informed, be a necessary condition for eligibility to
the office of proctor. Moreover, there is to be a fistic as well as a
Classical and Mathematical Tripos, at which the most distinguished
candidate for honours will obtain the title of Senior Bruiser; and
whereat all those plucked will, with truth, be said to be ‘floored. It is
rumoured that the resolutions to the effect foregoing did not pass with-
out some opposition from the heads of houses, which has been imputed
to pedantic prejudice; but probably arose from fear of being punched ;
one which we imagine is not ill founded, considering the recent occur-
rences at Cambridge.
The ATRICAL INTELLIGENCE.
WE understand a new drama is being written for the “Industrious
Fleas.” They are to ſappear after ToM THUMB, in a grand burlesque,
to be called “The Haunted Boarding-House, or the Demon Flea.”

PUNCH'S TOUR IN THE MANUFACTURING DISTRICTS.
Punch has received so many gracious letters—so many kind and
hospitable respondings to his expressed determination to visit the
manufacturing districts, in order that he may (to the astonishment of
the civilised and uncivilised world), give in his cosmopolite pages the
most faithful representation of everything of English manufacture,
from a steam-frigate to a mouse-trap;-Punch, we say, has been so
intreated to make the pilgrimage, that he cannot but consent. Eng-
land, at this moment, knows very little of her manufacturing trea-
sures ; now we intend to astonish her with a knowledge of the
unknown wonders within her.
It is necessary, however, that the manufacturers should properly
understand us.
Whatever Punch reviews, Punch KEEPS His motto may, there-
fore run, Nihil tetigit, quod non grabarit
If, for instance, it be the benevolent purpose of Punch to review,
and graphically represent, a silver tea and coffee service, of the
Queen's pattern,-Punch will, certainly, think the manufacturer no
gentleman should he for one moment dream of a return of the articles.
The same regulation will, of course, apply to any chronometer,
though jewelled in a hundred holes.
Carrying out our noble purpose, and resolving to begin our manu-
facturing tour with London, we called a day or two since at the Bank
of England. We saw MR. PATTERson ; a very courteous person,
apparently, though we fear a Whig. (By the way, we cannot say
much for his pale sherry, and the biscuits were abominable.) Well,
we made our purpose known to the Governor. We told him
that we desired to give a fac-simile engraving of a £1,000 Bank of
England note. He smiled, and said he would afford our engraver
every facility. He immediately rang the bell, and in a few moments
laid the document before us. We took up the note, and with one of
our best smiles were about to consign it to our pocket-book, when
PATTERson (a little rudely, we think), said he could not suffer us to
carry off the property, but it was quite at the service of any engraver
we might send. We confess it ; at the moment we had not the face
to speak our meaning, but went to our country house, and—as ink
doesn't blush, unless it's red—wrote to MR.PATTERson the subjoined:—
I.-PUNCH TO MR. PATTERSox.
“Punch presents his compliments to Mr. PATTERson, and shall be
happy to give an engraving of the £1,000 note in Punck's world-
searching periodical. To return the said note, however, would be in
utter violation of Punch's principles, as, although the engraving may
do Punch some good, it must do the Bank of England considerably
more; inasmuch as the desire to possess £1,000 notes will no doubt be
greatly increased after the appearance of the said engraving, and the
Bank of England profit considerably by such publicity.
“The Pecksniffery.”
II.-Mr. PATTERSON TO PUNCH.
“MR. PATTERSON has only to repeat his objection. He will, upon
due security, lend the £1,000 note to be engraved, but it must be
returned 1
“Bank of England.”
III.-PUNChi to Mr. PATTERSON.
“UNDER such circumstances, Punch declines the loan of the £1,000.
and will think it a stringent duty due to the public to show, by a
future series of engravings, the very marked superiority of the notes of
the Bank of Elegance to the notes of the Bank of England.
“Punch might, but will not, dilate upon the very ill manners implied
in the Governor's italics.
“The Pecksniffery.”
Here the correspondence ended ; but we trust to have better luck in
the provinces. And now, a word as to THE PECKs NIFFERY. We
shall in our next present to the public a view of that suburban abode.

which the learned Serjeant very significantly expressed himself

THE GERMAN SCHOOL.
- WA
/ \ A 2
3
THE alarming spread of the German School in Art has created considerable astonishment ;
but the phenomenon has at length been accounted for, by it having been discovered that
the Committee of the Art Union cannot understand, and will not patronise any other class
of drawing. Every competition for the Art Union Prizes is consequently driven, in self-
defence, to adopt the serpent-like hair for the countenance, inflamed gooseberries for the eyes,
and tufts of tow for the mustaches, which are the principal features of the German School
of drawing.
We . furnished three striking specimens of this extraordinary class of composition :-
No. 1. Is supposed to represent that state of pathos into which a lawyer's clerk is liable
to fall after office hours, when giving himself up to BULwer and melancholy, by reading a
novel of that author, and fancying himself the hero thereof.
No. 2. Is a victim to strong emotions, and to that excessive length of hair which implies an
inability to pay the perruquier's small demand.
No. 3. Is a warrior with that peculiar turn of the head which is not exactly to be found in
nature, but could no doubt be accomplished if Nature had only thought of supplying the
human neck with a sort of double swivel, allowing the head to be turned completely round, so
that the warrior's nose would be where his occiput ought to be.
We have thought proper to give these specimens of the German School, in order that
its merits may be fairly tested. The above figures embody all the beauties of this style,
which has found so much and such exclusive favour in the eyes of the Committee of the
Art Union.
THE ELECTRICAL MINISTER.
A GREAT sensation has lately been produced at Paris by the wonderful feats of a young
lady, a MADEMoisellE ANGELIQUE Cottin, who appears to be a sort of torpedo in petticoats.
Chairs and tables fly across the room on a touch from her apron, when she is charged with
the fluid, and she can be attracted or repulsed at will by the magnet.
It is, perhaps, not generally known that we possess a similar but much more wonderful
phenomenon amongst us. What is MADEMoisellE Cottin's performance in this way to SIR
Robert PEEL's 2
The following detail of experiments proves his infinitely greater powers of attraction
and repulsion :-
ExPERIMENT I.
The Premier, after being very heavily charged indeed during the late debate, being
placed on the Conservative benches by a single speech, succeeded in violently throwing
from him one half of the Conservative members, quite to the opposite side of the house.
Notwithstanding the tremendous efforts made by SIR SIDNEY HERBERT and SIR JAMEs GRAHAM
to hold these gentlemen in their places, the shock was so great that they were almost
knocked over themselves by the violence with which the Protectionists flew across. MR.
FERRAND was flung with a tremendous shock against a knot of Free-traders, and talked
so very wildly that it was feared he had sustained a concussion of the brain. He is not yet
quite recovered.
ExPERIMENT II.
* SIR Robert, being again charged the night after, was found to possess the power of
attracting the League members, in the same proportion as he repelled the gentlemen of
the Central Agricultural Society in Bond Street. MR. Cobden was drawn right across
the house, apparently without the least power of resistance.
ExPERIMENT III.
SIR. Robert, being again charged, was put en rapport with Lord GeoRGE BENTINCR
and MR. D'IsrAELI by means of silk (generally a non-conductor). Notwithstanding, he
drew the honourable members into a "slough
of absurdity, and fixed them so tight in a
dilemma, that they were quite unable to get out
of it—until SLR Robert left the house.
ExPERIMENT IV.
SIR Robert being again charged, and a
quantity of arguments presented to him by the
member for Northamptonshire, these, though
considered particularly strong by those who
selected them, were at once broken to pieces,
one after another, by a single sentence of SIR
Robert's. A gentleman of great scientific
acquirements, who has watched these experi-
ments, assures us that SIR Robert is quite as
powerful as the electric eel, and if possible, more
slippery.
Encouraged by the success of the PREMIER,
MR. D'IsrAELI has announced his possession of
similar powers. He attempted, when fully
charged with sarcasm, and facts from M'CUL-
Loch's Commercial Dictionary, to electrify the
House. The attempt was a total failure, and
Mr. D'Israeli is accordingly pronounced to be
an impostor.

MONG those who may be expected to join the ranks of the Protec-
tionists against the Premier's free-trade policy, are the numerous
smugglers, whose occupation will be entirely gone if the import duties
are generally abolished. We have read very graphic accounts of mid-
night meetings held by agricultural labourers, to make a statement of
their grievances; but we are quite sure that nothing can come up to the
scene represented at a gathering of individuals interested in the pro-
tection of the trade of the smuggler. A distinguished dealer in contra-
band silks was unanimously voted into the chair, and he asked, in a
very passionate harangue, what was to become of himself and his
children, when French goods could be imported so cheap that it would
not be worth while to defraud the Custom House? “I am a family
man,” he exclaimed, “and every bottle of brandy I smuggle over here
is a dinner to my wife and blessed infants. What is to become of the
old woman and the babies at home, if our tyrants take away from us
that protection which makes it worth our while to smuggle 2" (Cheers.)
Several Custom House officers and searchers stated their cases in
very forcible language. “I have got a bit of bread,” said one, “for the
º | -
T.
last ten years, by winking at the introduction of contraband articles.
What am I to do when there is nothing to wink at 2 " (Cries of “Aye,
aye, that’s the real point.”) - -
MR. BRETT, of the British Brandy Manufactory, declared this was a
manufacturer's question, and he would ask what was to become of him
and his men if the foreign Eau de vie could be had instead of that truly
British spirit which constituted the strength of the country He
would say nothing about the smuggler, though he was one of those who
were of opinion that— , - *
“A bold smugglery, a country's pride,
When, once destroyed, can never be supplied;"
but he would put it as a matter relating solely to British industry. If
our native brandy was not to be protected, an immense number of
hands would be thrown out of employ, and they must all go to the
Union. (Cries of shame.)
After a few more speeches in a similar strain, the meeting was
dissolved.
THE GLUT OF COMETS.
CoNs|DERABLE confusion is likely to arise from the recent increase in
the number of comets. Almost every arrival from abroad brings intel-
ligence of some continental astronomer having discovered a new comet.
The public ought to receive with considerable caution all announce-
ments of this nature ; for nothing is easier than to palm off a flash of
lightning, or some other eccentric piece of luminous matter, on the
generality of the public as a genuine and bond fide comet. Besides,
there are many persons who never trouble themselves to look further
than the newspaper report ; and if they see a little descriptive jargon
about latitudes and degrees, with S.S.E. and N.E. mysteriously inter-
woven with the account, they take it for granted that the whole account
is accurate. We should advise that every new light, alleged to be a
comet, should be regularly brought up for examination before a commit-
tee of qualified astronomers, as a preliminary to its admission among
the rest of the recognised luminous bodies. We remember a light on a
very elevated position in Vauxhall Gardens enjoyed for a whole season
the reputation of a newly-discovered fixed star, in consequence of some
noodle having detected it at the end of his telescope, and written to the
papers to announce the result of his nocturnal observation. It was not
until the close of the season the mistake was discovered. We should
not wonder at some of the new comets turning out to be something of
the kind alluded to.
The Houses of Parliament.
WE understand that in consequence of the tardiness shown by MR.
BARRY in completing the Houses of Parliament, he has been requested
to consult some artist in barley-sugar ; for it is a notorious fact that
the whole building has been done in that very delicate material long
ago, as an ornament for a confectioner's window ; while the execution
of the object in the rough—in mere brick and stone—has not yet been
accomplished. A person who supplies the bazaars, has offered to lay a
wager that she will cut out the whole of Mr. BARRY's design, in card,
and gum it together all complete, before he has finished his building’on
the large scale, which, it is contended, is really much less difficult, to
accomplish.
CELESTIAL “PAS DE QUATRE."
THERE is great attraction amongst the stars just at present, for we
read that the four new comets are announced to appear next week, all
on the same evening. Could not MR. LUMLEY engage them for an
astrological ballet 2

THE SNOBS OF ENGLAND.
BY ONE OF THEMSELVEs.
CHAP. W.-WHAT SNOBS ADMIR.E.
ow let us consider how dif-
_ ficult it is even for great
: men to escape from being
s Snobs. It is very well for
* the reader, whose fine feel-
ings are disgusted by the as-
sertion that Kings, Princes,
Lords, are Snobs, to say,
“You are confessedly a
Snob yourself. In profess-
ing to depict Snobs, it is
only your own ugly mug
which you are copying with
a Narcissus-like conceit
and fatuity.” But I shall
pardon this explosion of ill
temper on the part of my constant reader, reflecting upon the misfor-
tune of his birth and country. It is impossible for any Briton, perhaps,
not to be a Snob in some degree. If people can be convinced of this
fact, an immense point is gained, surely. If I have pointed out the
disease, let us hope that other scientific characters may discover the
remedy.
If you, who are a person of the middle ranks of life, are a Snob,
you whom nobody flatters particularly ; you who have no toadies ;
you whom no cringing flunkies or shopmen bow out of doors ; you
whom the policeman tells to move on ; you who are jostled in the
crowd of this world, and amongst the Snobs our brethren ; consider
how much harder it is for a man to escape who has not your advan-
tages, and is all his life long subject to adulation, the butt of meanness:
consider how difficult it is for the Snob's idol not to be a Snob.
As I was discoursing with my friend EUGENio in this impressive
way, Lord BucKRAM passed us, the son of the MARQUIs of BAGwig,
and knocked at the door of the family mansion in Red Lion Square.
His noble father and mother occupied, as everybody knows, distin-
guished posts in the Courts of late Sovereigns. The Marquis was
Lord of the Pantry, and her Ladyship, Lady of the Powder Closet to
QUEEN CHARLotte. Buck (as I call him, for we are very familiar)
gave me a nod as he passed, and I proceeded to show to EUGENIo how
it was impossible that this nobleman should not be one of ourselves,
having been practised upon by Snobs all his life.
His parents resolved to give him a public education, and sent him
to school at the earliest possible period. The REveREND OTTo Rose,
D.D., Principal of the Preparatory Academy for young noblemen and
gentlemen, Richmond Lodge, took this little Lord in hand, and fell
down and worshipped him. He always introduced him to fathers and
mothers who came to visit their children at the school. He referred,
with pride and pleasure to the most noble the MARQUIs of BAGwig,
as one of the kind friends and patrons of his Seminary. He made
LoRD BUCKRAM a bait for such a multiplicity of pupils, that a new
wing was built to Richmond Lodge, and thirty-five new little white
dimity beds were added to the establishment. MRs. Rose used to
take out the little Lord in the one-horse chaise with her when she
paid visits, until the Rector's lady and the Surgeon's wife almost died
with envy. His own son and Lord BuckRAM having been discovered
robbing an orchard together, the Doctor flogged his own flesh and
blood most unmercifully for leading the young Lord astray. He parted
from him with tears. There was always a letter directed to the Most
Noble the MARQUIs of BAGwig, on the Doctor's study table, when any
visitors were received by him.
At Eton, a great deal of Snobbishness was thrashed out of Lord
BUCKRAM, and he was birched with perfect impartiality. Even there,
however, a select band of sucking tuft-hunters followed him. YoUNG
CROEsus lent him three-and-twenty bran new sovereigns out of his
father's bank. YoUNG CRAwLEY did his exercises for him, and tried
“to know him at home,” but YouNG BULL licked him in a fight of
fifty-five minutes, and he was caned several times with great advan-
tage for not sufficiently polishing his master, SMITH's, shoes. Boys are
not all toadies in the morning of life.
But when he went to the University, crowds of toadies sprawled
over him. The tutors toadied him. The fellows in hall paid him
great clumsy compliments. The Dean never remarked his absence
from Chapel, or heard any noise issuing from his rooms. A number
of respectable young fellows, (it is among the respectable, the Baker-
Street class, that Snobbishness flourishes, more than among any set of
people in England)—a number of these clung to him like leeches.
| There was no end now to CROEsus's loans of money; and BUCKRAM
couldn't ride out with the hounds, but CRAwley (a timid creature by
nature) was in the field, and would take any leap at which his friend
chose to ride. YoUNG Rose came up to the same College, having been
kept back for that express purpose by his father. He spent a quarter's
allowance in giving BucKRAM a single dinner; but he knew there was
always pardon for him for extravagance in such a cause ; and a ten-
pound note always came to him from home when he mentioned Buck-
RAM's name in a letter. What wild visions entered the brains of MRs.
Podge and Miss Podge, the wife and daughter of the Principal of
LoRD BUCKRAM's College, I don't know, but that reverend old gen-
tleman was too profound a flunky by nature ever for one minute to
think that a child of his could marry a nobleman. He therefore
hastened on his daughter's union with ProFEssoR CRAB.
When Lord BUCKRAM, after taking his honorary degree, (for Alma
Mater is a Snob, too, and truckles to a Lord like the rest,)—when
LoRD BUCKRAM went abroad to finish his education, you all know
what dangers he ran, and what numbers of caps were set at him :
LADY LEAch and her daughters followed him from Paris to Rome,
and from Rome to Baden-Baden; Miss LEGGIT burst into tears before
his face when he announced his determination to quit Naples, and
fainted on the neck of her mamma; CAPTAIN MACDRAGON, of Mac-
dragonstown, county Tipperary, called upon him to “explene his in-
tintions with respect to his sisther, Miss AMALLA MAcDRAGoN, of
Macdragonstown,” and proposed to shoot him unless he married that
spotless and beautiful young creature, who was afterwards led to the
altar by MR. MUFF, at Cheltenham. If perseverance and forty thou-
sand pounds down could have tempted him, Miss LYDIA CRqests
would certainly have been LADY BUCKRAM. Count Towhowski was
glad to take her with half the money, as all the genteel world knows.
And now, perhaps, the reader is anxious to know what sort of a
man this is who wounded so many ladies' hearts, and who has been
such a prodigious favourite with men. If we were to describe him it
would be personal, and Punch notoriously is never so. Besides, it
| really does not matter in the least what sort of a man he is, or what
his personal qualities are.
Suppose he is a young nobleman of a literary turn, and published
| poems ever so foolish and feeble, the Snobs would purchase thousands
of his volumes: the publishers (who refused my Passion-Flowers,
and my grand Epic at any price) would give him his own. Suppose
he is a nobleman of a jovial turn, and has a fancy for wrenching off
knockers, frequenting gin-shops, and half murdering policemen ; the
public will sympathise good-naturedly with his amusements, and
say he is a hearty, honest fellow. Suppose he is fond of play and
the turf, and has a fancy to be a blackleg, and occasionally conde-
scends to pluck a pigeon at cards ; the public will pardon him, and
many honest people will court him, as they would court a house-
breaker, if he happened to be a Lord. Suppose he is an idiot;
yet, by the glorious constitution, he's good enough to govern us,
Suppose he is an honest, high-minded gentleman ; so much the
better for himself. But he may be an ass, and yet respected ; or a
ruffian, and yet be exceedingly popular ; or a rogue, and yet excuses
will be found for him. Snobs will still worship him. Male Snobs will
do him honour, and females look kindly upon him, however hideous
he may be.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LEGAL “AT HOMES.”
HE greatest excitement has been created in the public,
but particularly in the forensic, mind, by the announce-
ment of the intended cultivation of music by the legal
profession. Barristers are seen hurrying about with
flutes concealed in the folds of their gowns, rolls of
music interspersed with their briefs, and fiddles poked
into their wig-boxes. Everything in the forensic world
wears the aspect of a musical festival. We should not
be surprised—as there is a fashion for amateur per-
formances—if we were to hear of a charitable concert
having been got up by some of the ornaments of the
Bar, upon which occasion some learned QUEEN's Counsel
and others may “kindly consent” to sing certain
popular ballads.
“THE Attorney-GENERAL For THIS NIGHT ONLY 1."
would be a tremendous line in a musical programme.
Unfortunately, however, the musical mania has seized
chiefly on the briefless, as illness usually exhibits itself
first, and rages most furiously in poor neighbourhoods.
Several shocking cases have broken out in the “three
pairs” all over the Temple. We have heard fright-
ful screams, interspersed with low moanings, issuing
from an attic in Hare Court, and frequent bleeding, by
a musical attendant, has been copiously resorted to.
The patient, it is said, has commenced a course of
treatment for his malady—or, as he insanely calls it, his
melody—which makes his condition much worse instead of improving it.
We regret to say that the juniors have been seized by scores in all the upper
districts of the Temple. There were at one time alarming symptoms in Inner
Temple Lane, for moanings were distinctly audible ; but it turned out to be a tem-
porary attack of “Old clothes ' " which, we are happy to say, got speedily subdued
by resorting at once to a regimen of porter.
Nothing is more disagreeable than a singing in the ears, and to this, unless a
stop is put to the mischief at once, all the inhabitants of the
Temple will beliable. The great difficulty is, how to deal
with the malady; for as the patients are chiefly adults, the
phlogistic treatment, usually so efficacious in juvenile in-
stances, cannot here be resorted to.
If, however, music is to be cultivated by those members
of the profession who have one bar's uninterrupted rest—
for want of occupation, either professional or otherwise—we
recommend for their own sakes that something profit-
able should be made of it. Some time ago we proposed a
series of legal evenings, little thinking that such a project
might, in consequence of the musical turn taken by the
gentlemen of the Bar, become really feasible. We therefore
have the pleasure of submitting to those gentlemen whose
leisure allows them an opportunity of giving legal enter-
tainments à la MATTHEws, the following programme of an
AT Honºr. 5 or, LAW AND LAUGHTER.
The curtain should rise and discover a table spread over
with a green cloth, a decanter of spring water, a couple of
lamps, and a variety of blocks for the wigs belonging to
the different characters. The forensic performer should
then proceed something in the following fashion :-
“Ladies and Gentlemen, I appear before you this even-
ing as a humble imitator of the late lamented MR.
MATTHEws, whose Table-Talk some of you may remember,
though others may have forgotten. Talking of MR. MAT-
THEws, reminds me that my introduction must be brief; and
talking of briefs, suggests to me the first document of that
kind I ever received. If you will allow me, I will embody
the circumstance in a song ; and if you will excuse my
stooping down for one moment—(stoops under the table)—
I shall be able to show you the costume in which I appeared
on that memorable occasion. (He rises in his barrister's wig
and gown.) Here, Ladies and Gentlemen, I am–(mimicking)
—Gentlemen of the Jury, a-hem—(strikes up the following
song:—
“As in my chambers, all alone,
At silent eve I sat,
Indulging a despairing groan,
I heard a rat-tat-tat.
I started up—I wiped my eye;
I would not show my grief.
What do I see—what do I spy 7–
. A client with a brief.
“I seize it in my eager hand;
He bids me look within,
That I may shortly understand
The cause I fain must win.
I did so—how my lips I bit,
With rage, despair, and grief –
There was a copy of a writ
Folded inside the brief/?
“This little anecdote, though simple in itself, illustrates,
to a very great extent, the truth of some remarks that are
commonly made upon the ungentlemanly conduct of a certain
portion of the profession.
“Some years ago, in the infancy of my professional career,
when every guinea was of consequence, I had reason to be
deceived in an early client. The first shock the feelings
receive in law is as potent as the original rebuff they expe-
rience in love. I had plighted my professional faith to this
client : I had, in fact—though I know I am risking my repu-
tation for professional correctness in this avowal, for nobody
else does it—oh, no l—nobody else, of course—I had, in fact,
permitted my clerk, the ever-memorable Thomson—of whom
more anon—to keep an account with him. One evening I
was sitting in silent melancholy at my chambers, pondering
over the vanity of human wishes, and other little matters
to which I am in the habit of devoting my leisure hours,
when a knock came at the door, to which my heart responded
by a gentle palpitation. I heard the voice of the “false
client,’ tendering a brief. I rushed forward, and seizing
that precious lyre which had been the solace of so many
briefless hours, I struck up the following strain, into which
I threw alternate bursts of pathos and indignation, though
I must confess the latter was very likely to predominate.
It is arranged to the beautiful air of
“TAKE BACK THY GIFT.’
‘Take back thy brief: it is a token
Of many a still-unsettled fee;
And since your word is long since broken,
Thy brief's not worth one rap to me.

Brought business to restore,
Oh take it back, for now, I own,

The above is a short specimen of such an entertainment as we propose
to write for any forensic vocalist who has the gift of telling anecdotes,
as well as the happy accomplishment of singing songs. Further parti-
culars may be known on application at the Punch Office.

which DR. REID favours the Legislature by
pumping in upon them an atmosphere of FAHREN-
HEIT's severest frost; and the Right Honourable
Baronet has an Indian planter's dress, to be put
on when the Doctor is trying the effect of hot
air and vapour, at the temperature of 96°, by way of variety.
It is all very well to talk of the heat of debate, but the enterprising
REID will take care no debate shall be so hot as to be without its cool
moments, at the very instant when it has come to the hottest. Any one
who has tried the effect of sitting

storm, with the sea and wind roar-

notion of the practical effect of
DR. REID's experiments.

way; but no one likes being par- -

The above little sketches of Par- -
liamentary Fashions, to suit the
alternate mildness and inclemency
of DR. REID, will be found very
serviceable to the members of the Legislature, to whom we most
respectfully dedicate them.
RIVALRY TO PUNCH, AT LAST.
WE take it to be rather unkind of our usually amiable contemporary
the Times, that he should have suggested the only opposition at which
Punch can possibly tremble. It has been suggested to ALMA MATER to
publish portions of its regulations with reference to University
education. Such a budget of broad humour we confess we could
scarcely hope to equal in richness. We shall take an early opportunity
of looking into them ourselves, and shall endeavour to be beforehand
with our academical opponents, by laying some of the raciest bits
before a British public at the earliest possible opportunity.
More GLORY.
ANother horse of ABD-El-KADER has been shot this week. One

E
WE have duly possessed the public with our intention of giving a
tremendous lift to the manufacturers of England, by laying before the
world correct engravings of every variety of bellows, dust-pan, cork-
screw, mightcap, hearth-rug, kettle-holder, teapot, &c. . At this
moment our confidential writers, duly attended by proper artists, are
making the tour of Birmingham, Manchester, Sheffield, the Potteries,
and other places. Now, rigidly keeping to the lineumarked out-for
ourselves, we shall keep all the articles reviewed,...and thus shall
furnish, from top to bottom, the Pecks NIFFERY with presentation
furniture. This very circumstance must, of course, give a tremen-
dous impetus to the trade of the country; for it must be imme-
diately conceded that there will be a mighty rush to secure the same
pattern-bellows that blows up the Wall's-end at the:PEcksNIFFERY—
the same dustpan that receives its dust and dirt, if dust or dirt can
defile such a temple ! We know that there are growelling and selfish
creatures who may be vile and base enough to attribute this peculiar
mode of furnishing the PECRsNIFFERY to the interested motives of the
proprietor. By no means. In making the PECRsNIFFERYasmagnificent
and as cosey as the industrial labours of England can render it, the
proprietor has but one wish beating at his heart—namely, the wish, the
inextinguishable desire to encourage the manufacturers of his beloved
country ! And this, he thinks, he will achieve in a manner wholly
characteristic of his enterprise and greatness of soul, by grouping
under one hospitable roof–for it is the intention of the pro-
prietor of the PEcks NIFFERY once a-week to throw open the hall-
doors to the dilettanti of the land—toast-and-water and rusks to be
liberally supplied on the occasion—under one roof, the most beauti-
ful samples of the manufactures of the land. Thus, the visitor
will behold the glories of Birmingham, Manchester, &c., &c., at little
more than one glance, and at only the expense of cab-hire to Penton-
ville ! (N.B. Master manufacturers forwarding candelabra, bedsteads,
tesselated pavement, tinder-boxes, &c. &c., are desired to send their
goods for review, carriage paid. And let them perfectly well under-
stand—for this fact cannot be too frequently, too earnestly insisted
upon—that all manufactures reviewed, are kept '')
Altogether, we think the Pecks NIFFERY does great credit to the
genius of the architect, who, having in the erection mixed so many
orders of art, may, we think, lay claim to the discovery of a new
order, to be known henceforth as the Art-Union Order. All the ex-
ternal points of the PEcksNIFFERY are admirably suggestive of its
purpose. It combines the utility of the shop for marine stores with
the florid beauties of one of the oldest Halls of England. We particu-
larly direct the attention to the bold yet graceful details of the boot-
jacks, and to the felicitous thought embodied in the knocker.

“JEAMES ’’ FORBIDDEN CHURCH.
ſº |
- 1 vſ R Y
SERVANTs
A comrespondent in the Times lifts up his voice against the ecclesi-
astical authorities of Rawstone Street Chapel, Brompton, inasmuch as
they will not admit any family plush to the cedar seats of that very
exclusive building. “Livery servants and dogs not admitted,” was in
the olden day written over Kensington Garden gates : the exterior of
the Brompton Chapel may bear alike mortifying tablet. “Can it be?”
—asks the master-proprietor of the plush—“can it be that a decently
clad individual, with a family badge”—(why not a family notch in his
ear or nose 2)—“a family badge upon his buttons of his—call it a sky-
blue or a canary-coloured coat—would distract over-much the attention
of his fellow-worshipping mortals 2 ” Now, to hazard an original
thought—much may be said on both sides. In the first place, the
Rawstone Street folks may not conceive how any man can be “decently
clad” if drest in sky-blue; though, to be sure, the sky-blue does in a
measure indicate the celestial yearnings of the master. They may,
too, think it proper that canaries should appear in yellow, but not
acknowledge the propriety of that colour on the back of a miserable
sinner. The correspondent, however, exclaims — -
“Let these persons know that at St. George's Church, Hanover Square, the real aris-
tocracy of the land are separated from their iiveried domestics by a mere oak panelling.”
“A mere oak panelling !” What a frail—a paltry barrier : Does
not the plebeian spirit pass through it 2
“At sea there's but a plank, they say,
"Twixt sailors and annihilation : "
But this is nothing. Only think of “a mere" oak panelling be-
tween a Duke and a footman We are not alarmists; but, thinking
of this, we cannot but think the aristocracy of St. George's in great
danger.
Now, the complainant is evidently not of the real aristocracy of the
land–(by the way, ADAM was of course the first aristocrat of the
land, being made of it,)—but is possibly of the aristocracy of the till.
We doubt it not ; he is one of “the Snobs of England;" and there-
| fore snobbishly puts his shop-boy into Sabbath livery, and bands his
four-and-nine with a band of copper-gilt, out of pure respect to the
Church and the Sunday.
We cannot dive into the hearts of the Chapel authorities; but pos-
sibly they object to the appearance of liveries in church: not that they
distract the attention of the congregation, but that they are unseemly
vestments for a place in which all men at least pretend to meet on
equal grounds. On the other hand, the correspondent may think that
his virtues are best shown forth to the world by his shop-boy clad in
motley. We know that MR. MILTON, in his Comus, speaking of
chastity, says—
“That when a soul is found sincerely chaste,
A thousand liveried angels lacquey her!”
Now, when we have seen high-born Christian maids and matrons
with eyes upon the ground, modestly mounting the Church steps, with
JEAMEs behind, carrying a very red and very golden Prayer-book, we
have generally thought that the pretty creatures had in their hearts
and souls the above lines of the aforesaid MR. MILTON ; that they
thought themselves most intensely in the predicament put forth by
the poet, and were “lacquied” accordingly. In like manner, the Times’
Correspondent may consider his sky-blue coat and canary-plush as
only the fair rewards of his virtue, and therefore be justified in being
very indignant at their exclusion from Rawstone Street Chapel,
Brompton. And then, again, Brompton is so suffocatingly select :
—the very air-pump of gentility l
NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.
GREAT alterations have been made in the uniforms of the Navy, such
alterations having been duly gazetted. The senior officers are to have
all sorts of epaulettes, gold loops, and gold lace. Really this is giving the
enemy a premium to fight with additional courage; for a line-of-
battle-ship will now be made doubly valuable by the bullion of her
officers. To be sure, they will have an added sense of property about
them, and fight accordingly": hence, should there be an American war
(which there will not), the carnage will be dreadful. A very capital
improvement has been made in the midshipmen’s uniforms—though no
account of it has been published. They are, however, to have the number
of years they may have passed for lieutenants, every year worked in
white worsted in their collars, in order to refresh the memory of any
visiting Lord of the Admiralty.
PLEAse, Sir, will You PUMP for ME?
A VERY CLOSE SHOT.
PARIs has not yet illuminated in celebration of the glad event, but
it is now certain that, at last, the French have killed ABD-El-KADER's
—horse. Thus, campaign after campaign, they are getting closer
to the Emir. In another seven years, we may now fairly expect that
they will kill ABD-El-KADER himself! So far, however, it is very
encouraging to have shot his grey horse.

PART II. THE RECONCILIATION.
MARsh AL BUGEAUD, MARSHAL BUGEAUD,
Flinging wide your lattice high,
Why this bootless indignation ?
“Au voleur/" in vain you cry.
See him hurry on his trousers
See him plunge into his boots'
Xºz!"
s | ,
-- 2-2,
Hark, he thunders for the Colonel !
Hark, “Turn out the men "" he shouts.
Quickly at the call they muster,
Fierce moustache, and frightful beard :
Then in brief inspiring accents
Loud the Marshal's voice is heard.
“Soldiers | Frenchmen Civilizers 1
Scour the country swift and sure :
Smoke the bees and bag the honey !
Stifle every blessed Moor
“Lots of centuries behold you !—
“Die, my comrades, never say !—
France expects that every Frenchman
Will his booty sack to-day !
“Spies have shown us the direction
Of my truant daughter's flight :
ABD-EL-KADER, ABD-EL-KADER,
You shall smoke for this 'ere night !”
Then he gave a general scramble,
Ribands red and crosses rare;—
Nearly all who did not catch them,
Had already got them there.
Then each trooper took his faggot,
And his box of lucifers—
Mounted straight his gallant charger—
Struck him with the jingling spurs;
Ne'er was razzia so successful
Since the Gallic cock took wing:
Fast and far they scour'd the country,
Burning, smoking, pillaging ;-
Prov’d “de la civilisation ”
That they were “les vrais apótres;”
And hung up some Arab damsels,
Pour encourager les autres.
Ha what spies yon peering trooper,
That to BUGEAUD's side he speeds 2
“Mille canons?” he shouts, “look yonder '"
Sure enough, two Arab steeds!
Each a double burden carries,
Now they see the chace behind them
Tearing at a fearful bat ;-
Swart Bou MAzA, swart Bou MAZA,
Now you own FIFINE is fat l—
“Faint not, JULIE ; faint not, JULIE,
We shall reach yon cavern yet !"—
“If we do, Papa will smoke us !
For he's in a fuming pet.”
Just in time, they reach the cavern,--
Not a barleycorn to spare—
In they leap, and block the entrance
Ere the foremost foe gets there.
In due course, dismount the troopers,
And prepare the 'custom'd blaze—
“Stay !” cries BUGEAUD, “Stay ! my daughter l—
This is not the common case.”
Then he steps up to the entrance—
“Hark ye, Moor, mon brave!” cries he ,
“Ere you die (to ease your conscience)
First restore my child to me.”— -
“Much I love your only daughter,
Much Bou MAzA loves her maid;
But, if you are bent on smoking,
Smoke us all / we an’t afraid—
“Why dost falter, MARsh AL BUGEAUD 2
Canst thou doubt what course is right,
With an Arab in a grotto,
And the means to strike a light 2"
“Were’t the maid alone, I'd do it;
But (my brain begins to whirl ()
Can I smoke my only daughter—
Suffocate the darling girl?”
See, the Father's heart opposes
What the Governor decrees;
Hark, at length the welcome order—
“Recover faggots | Stand at ease !
“I forgive thee, only daughter |
I forgive thy robber Moor;
Though of MRs. ABD-EL-KADERs
He has got already four.”
Forth then comes brave ABD-EL-RADER,
Fainting JULIE comes to light ; -
Comes FIFINE with swart Bou MAZA,
Looking in a precious fright.
ABD-EL-KADER and the Marshal,
See, they shake the friendly hand;
Into the arms of swart Bou MAzA
Falls the Second-in-Command.
Home returning, all together
Talk the day's proceedings o'er ;
Smoking now the mild Havannah,
'ice the ferocious Moor.
Thus the Marshal's lovely daughter
Won the Arab Chief so plain :
Thus were saved from suffocation
All that did unsmok'd remain.
The Drama-
THE royal children have been taken to Astley's to see the horses.
The public were not admitted to see the infants themselves, but were
afterwards generously allowed to look at their little chairs 1
Which unequal makes the race:
To a skilful handieapper,
Such a match were sore disgrace.

THE DUKE of NewcasTLE seems to be a first-rate painter of happy
peasantry ; and his latest sketch of agricultural labourers is peculiarly
rich and felicitous. He pictures them as “that humble but most de-
serving class upon whose industry and labour the wealthiest merchants
and producers depend ; as, in turn, the workman depends upon his
employer for ample remuneration, in the shape of liberal wages.” The
dependence may be mutual ; but there can be no doubt the wealthy
merchant gets much the better of it. The breach of confidence is all
on his side, the disappointment all on the side of the labourer.
According to the Duke's account, the workman is a being devoted to
sportive pleasure, and oppressed by plethora. He has nothing to do
but to perform his daily work, and receive his “ample remuneration in
the shape of liberal wages.” Our artist has endeavoured to carry, out
this pleasant picture, conceived by the fertile imagination of the DUKE
of NEwcAstLE. We very much fear, however, that, after all,
“It is but Fancy's sketch.”
PUNCH*S POLITICAL DICTIONARY.
Flots AM. That part of a wreck which remains floating in the
water, and if not claimed within a year, goes to the Sover EIGN. If,
however, a man gets into hot-water, and is only just able to keep his
head above it, though the bark of his fortune may be a wreck, his head,
which is in the condition of Flotsam, does not become forfeited.
Forest ALLING. The buying up of a commodity to cause a mo-
nopoly in the hands of one person. This used to be unlawful, but is
so no longer; and, if I publish a tragedy, I may go and forestall it ;
that is to say, prevent its getting on to the book-stalls, by buying up
every copy of it.
Forest LAws. At the Norman Conquest, all animals of chase be-
came vested in the Crown, and WILLIAM had all the wild beasts of the
kingdom settled upon himself and his heirs for ever. Hunting the
stag was then expressly forbidden ; and there is no doubt there are
many stags of the present day who would like to see the Forest Laws re-
vived, so far as to prohibit the practice of stag-hunting. The CoNQUEROR
is said to have possessed an immense number of forests, and 781 parks. But,
probably, some of these parks were no bigger than that of Whetstone.
Forgery. From the French forger, to heat metal and hammer it;
but what this derivation can have to do with signing another man's
name, is by no means evident.
FRANCHIse. A synonymous term with liberty, though the elective
franchise is often a badge of slavery.
FRAUDULENT CoNve YANCE. A term applied to an illegal transfer of
land, but the every-day illustration of a fraudulent conveyance, is a
cab, the driver of which demands double his legal fare ; or an omni-
bus which undertakes to set you down at one part of the town, and
leaves you in another.
FREEDOM : ride LIBERTY. “Britons never, never, never shall be
slaves,” “Rule Britannia,” &c., &c. Freedom is now seldom bestowed
with any formality, except at the minor theatres, where various
| countries are freed by the leading tragedian, who gives liberty to
Switzerland, to Spain, or to Italy, according to the place in which is
laid the scene of the drama he is the temporary hero of.
| FREE TRADE. The liberty of trading with other countries, unfet-
tered by restrictive duties. To the monopolists, such trade is far
more free than welcome.
| FRIENDLY SocIETIEs. Institutions founded for mutual benefit, but
too often leading to disputes, and occasionally to the unlawful dis-
appearance of “the box,” with all the assets. Friendly Societies are
|t great improvement on the old Benefit Clubs, where, by paying
sixpence a week for a few months, a member became entitled to
support during the remainder of his existence. The result generally
was a row, followed by the breaking up of the club, and not
unfrequently the total evaporation of the treasurer.
TO GOVERN ESSES.
We have received the subjoined letter, addressed by a lady—a very
gorgeous lady, no doubt—to a governess :—
“Mrs. H–s compliments to Miss S- begs to acknowledge the
receipt of her note of this morning and should not engage with any
young person unless she were compotent of teaching singing, my eldest
daughter is sixteen years of age, the second thirteen, the youngest
[daughter, of course] a little boy ten. The person who has now left has
resided five years with us, as teacher to my family her salary never
exceeded sixteen pounds paying her own laundressy, she was thoroughly
compotent of tuition in every respect should Miss S-feel compotent
of teaching singing &c MRs. H–s would wish her to name salary and
every particular.
44
near
“Aylesbury.
“January 1846.”
It is plain that MRs. H. (from the style of her letter) is, to use her
own phrase, “compotent” to judge of the scholastic powers of any
young “person.” And she therefore offers sixteen pounds to the suc-
cessor of the “person” who has “now left.” Sixteen pounds a year
for stuffing her children with “tuition in every respect.” What may
MRs. H. give to the “person” in the kitchen who stuffs her geese and
ducks Scarcely less, we should think, than £16 per annum,_but
then, to be sure, it is more important properly to stuff geese and ducks
with sage and onion, than young ladies and “a little boy of ten” with
“tuition in every respect.”
THE AMERICAN, LINE.
IF PRESIDENT Polk means mischief to his country and the whole
civilised world, he will speedily begin mustering forces with a view to
hostilities with Great Britain. What the organisation of the American
army is, we do not know, but the following corps, we should think,
form a distinguished portion of it. The Kentucky Gougers ; the
Bowie-Knife Brigade ; the Sword-Stick Division ; the Revolving
Barrelleers. We might also mention the Auxiliary Niggers; but we
suspect that this regiment is not exactly to be depended on. We still
hope, however, that peace will ultimately be preserved, and that the
affair will end with BoMBAstEs’ address to his followers :—“Begone,
brave army, and don't kick up a row.”
News for Bugeaud.
WE have been credibly informed that ABD-El-KADER is living at
Algiers. He has never left the capital for the last six years, excepting
when MARshAL BUGEAUD has made grand expeditions to capture him.
On these occasions he has always followed the French army. He
returned with the Marshal a fortnight back, and took up his usual
abode, two doors from the Governor's palace. He was present at the
harangue of the Marshal to his troops, and laughed heartily at the
allusions to himself. The French Government is perfectly welcome to
make any use it pleases of our intelligence.
WORKS OF IMAGINATION.
MR. FERRAND has received an offer from Louis PHILIPPE to superin-
tend that fine imaginative work which is published in bulletins, the
French Telegraph. His Majesty offered this appointment to the talented
Member immediately after reading one or two of his speeches.

PEEL AND POLK.
THE English Premier has taken the happiest method of dealing with the American
President. Polk fires off inflammatory messages, while PEEL returns the attack with
Free-Trade measures. The latter will, we have every hope, prove irresistible, and
Polk will not be able to make a successful stand against the very felicitous mode of
warfare adopted by our Free-Trade Minister. It is not likely that the American people
will be misguided enough to continue a hostility, which will be so directly opposed to
their own interests.
PEEL's Free-Trade must be victorious against Polk's firebrands. America may,
if it pleases, pelt us with its corn, while we return the compliment by pitching into the
United States some of our manufactured articles. This will be much better for both
parties than an exchange of lead, whether in the form of swan or grape, or packed in
canister.
ADDRESS FROM MR. OLDCASTLE.
WE have great pleasure in publishing the letter of this firm and consistent old
gentleman, about whom we have lately felt very uncomfortable. What, we have asked
ourselves, would be the feelings of a Pagan parent whose first-born son, on being sud-
denly converted to the Christian faith, should proceed to smash a golden calf in his
father's own private oratory 2 Should we not pardon the very worst grammar, the
most unintelligible depths of bathos, the most unpleasant Billingsgate, in our commi-
seration for the sufferings of the Pagan gentleman in question ?
“To my Fellow-Parishioners:—
“Encouraged by your former kindness, I trust that it should not be mistimed
to encroach once more on your affectionate attention. If my grammar were bad, yet
my heart is in the usual situation ; and if my heart should be in the wrong position,
yet my soul beats with the best intentions. I might be artless and unsophisticated, but
I am an affectionate old man.
“About this time last year, I presumed to address you upon a subject of intense
interest then in progress. I then hazarded an opinion that the same ruthless taste
which altered the cut of the collar would not scruple to change the hue of the whole
coat. You have witnessed with stupefaction and abomination the hideous treachery and
tergiversation of the Beadle, which flared up suddenly upon your incredulous view,
in the full blaze of its triumphant deformity, supported by a shameless effrontery, unex-
ampled in the annals of well-regulated parishes 1
“The Beadle expected that he had so contrived and so judiciously settled the colour
which he has got permission for the present to wear, that becomingness was certain
—ridicule impossible. No man was ever more mistaken in his calculations, no Beadle
ever more deceived in an estimate of his own controlling (if not despotic), power and
individual essentiality. Instead of dismay from the fear of losing him, he finds that no
one desires to retain his services; and where he thought to raise admiration, he has only
raised a pitiless storm of scoffs from the boys, and scornful inquiries after his mother.
Faith and confidence in him have ceased, and his parochial sun is set !!
“Under the orange coat we have flourished; under it and by it—observe well, Not
In spite of it—Little Pedlington has grown into a parish of the very first respecta-
bility. It is not, therefore, because I happen to possess some cloth of that colour,
which I have no other way to dispose of, that I call upon you all to lose not a day
or an hour ! but instantly and busily set to work to form and organise an Orange
Society around every fireside l l and with the energy, the just and firm, but, though firm,
still unbending determination of Pedlingtonians, and with the roar of the Pedlingtonian
Lion to back you, you may reasonably hope that you may be enabled to save your
insulted and injured parish from the most fearful perils which the machinations
—
or infatuations of false men and treacherous Beadles
ever devised for the reform and ruin of the place of
their birth . . .

(Iije Queen amb (ſtſ)iſbrem at 38tlep'g.
It may have been observed by many of our readers,
that HER MAJESTY has not been once this season to
the Italian Opera, though she has visited the French
Plays frequently, and once, in the true spirit of a
British parent, “taken the children to Astley’s.”
We like to see this disposition “to make the children
happy” by treating them to that establishment,
which was always the fairy land of our infancy. The
PRINCE of WALEs and the PRINCEss Royal have
passed that charming epoch in human existence—a
first introduction to WIDDicom B. The very thought
brings us back to those days of light-heartedness and
light-jacketedness, when the bedizened WIDDIcomb,
in the same turned-down collar, the same Hessians,
the same cartridge-box, that he still wears, first
started upon our mazed and mithered vision.
Henceforth WIDDIcomb took his place in our
mental repository by the side of Little Red Riding
Hood, Cinderella, and all the other fairy creatures
with whom our infant mind had already become
peopled. Widdicoxib has now got into the head of
the little Prince and Princess, and there is no
brushing him out of the head into which he has once
found admittance.
While, however, we commend the kindness evinced
on the part of the QUEEN and PRINCE ALBERT, in
giving the little ones the Astle LAN treat, we must
express a hope that proper care will be taken to
point out the erroneous views of history that are
sometimes given in the amphitheatrical spectacles
of MR. BATTY's establishment. Juvenile Royalty
must not be left to the absurd supposition, that the
Battle of Waterloo was fought between 18 Scotch
Greys, headed by twelve Field. Marshals, against
Buonaparte, and a brilliant staff, leading on eight
cuirassiers and one Mameluke. Nor should the notion
be encouraged, that the troops secreted themselves
behind trusses of straw, like Les Moissonneurs, in the
celebrated pas of Les Danseuses Viennoises.
History, as taught at Astley's, is an amusing, but
not a healthy style of instruction. It pleases the
imagination, but does not satisfy the judgment. It
is said of the celebrated SIsMoRDI, the author of the
Italian Republics, that he fainted away at the Coburg,
to which he had repaired to witness the performance
of the Dumb Girl of Genoa, in the hope that he might
have been enabled to enrich his notes with some
excerpta from the melodrama, in reference, to some
nice points of Genoese history. The illustrious
Micheller was “sold" in the same shocking manner,
when he repaired to Astley's to witness the exer-
tions of Mr. Gowers AL as Napoleon. When the
Emperor began planning a vast campaign, assisted by
a peasant, whose sister had been ill-treated by a
French Officer, whose epaulettes Gomers.All tore off
and indignantly trod upon, MichELET rushed ºut of
the house, and ran wildly into the Westminster
Road, declaring that Lord (J. H.) AMHERs1, the
author of the piece, had endeavoured to stab the
honour of France with the steel pen of the dramatist.
In order to avoid mistakes of this sort on the
part of the infant Princes and Princesses, we repeat
our warning, that historical dramas should always
be taken cum grano salis—with a chapter of PINNock.
Terrible Niews.
We thought nothing could equal the rapidity with
which the Spaniards upset Ministries, and threw the
kingdom into a state of revolt, but we find a war;
steamer called the Terrible has just been constructed
at Woolwich, which has the power of making no
less than fourteen revolutions in one minute.

FRENCH NAVAL
|NTELLIGENCE.
OUR correspondent at Marseilles sends us the usual package of
Marseilles' quilts, and the following startling piece of iſºmºio.
which seems to say that quilting in another sense is in store for us
from the same quarter.
A new apparatus has, it seems, been invented by a Frenchman for
the use of the Gallic navy, enabling it to snuff out British vessels, and
extinguish British valour, upon the old simple snuffers and extinguisher's
principle, which has long been applied to our bedroom sº:
As the contrivance is rather difficult to comprehend without ocular
demonstration, we furnish a drawing. Number 1, represents the
PRINCE DE Joinville on the paddle-box of the Belle Poule—or the Bell-
pull, as it is sometimes called—giving orders for the instant annihilation
of an English squadron. Number 2, is a pair of bifurcated snuffers,
on a swivel joint, so that they may be turned in any direction, and
thus be ready at all points to grab the flying enemy. Number 3,
is an extinguisher, capable of being lowered over the English Admiral,
in case of his flaring up, and thus putting him at once hors de combat.
The numerous vessels that are running away are supposed to be the
British fleet flying in terror and confusion from before the French
funnel. The snuffers are so arranged that they may be used for
snuffing off the flags of neutrals, as well as for putting out entirely all
|hostile vessels.
PUTNEY BRIDGE TO “PUNCH.”
“MR. PUNCH,-
- “One of my toll-keepers having just read out to a waterman
the letter of MR. H. WALKER, of Halfpenny Hall, Fulham, that ap-
peared in your paper, about the pennies taken for me on Sundays, -I,
Putney Bridge, herewith declare that the Bishop of LoNDoN has
or Putney any feeling whatever in the extra Sabbath halfpenny.
“Mr. Punch, I was built upon the authority of an Act of Parliament,
an Act passed in the year 1725, when the Lords and Commons
determined as follows upon the fares to be levied by me on all
travellers:– -
“‘For every coach, chariot, Berlin, chaise, chair, or calash, drawn by six or more
horses, the sum of two i.
(Any ditto, ditto, drawn by four horses, one shilling and sixpence.)
“‘For every coach, chariot, Berlin, chaise, chair, or calash, drawn by less than four
horses, the sum of—one shilling!”
“‘For every foot-passenger on Sundays, ONE PENNY : And on every other day,+
One Halfpenny!'
“Now, instead of being abused by MR. WALKER, I ought to be, with
BILLY TAYLOR, “very much applauded for what I have done ; ' for, in
the first place, I might by the Act of 1725 charge not less than “one
shilling’ for one horse, whereas I modestly hold my hand out for only
sixpence. To be sure, I make it up on Sundays, for then I double the
toll (for the sake of religion), and will have twelvepence.
“I know I’m a very ugly bridge. I know the steam-boat companies
swear at me (as if people thought of steam-boats when my arches were
built 1)—nevertheless, if folks don't like me, they can go round. There's
Hammersmith, a fine gimcrack thing, cheaper than I am,_let 'em
try that. I stand upon my Sunday penny, and am your humble
servant, “PUTNEY BRIDGE.”
“[PRIVATE AND CoNFIDENTIAL.]—It is said that, with the march of
the times, my tolls must come down sooner or later. Nevertheless, I'm
determined, as long as I decently can (a little longer, some say), to levy
the Sabbath pence. It's so religious !”
-
RETIREMENT FROM PARLLAMENT.
WE are about to lose PLUMPTRE. There can be very little doubt
that we must undergo the calamity of such an event, for he has given
it as his opinion, that “the conduct of the Government in reference to
Corn-Law Repeal is enough to make man disgusted with public life "
He, moreover, looked upon the admission of foreign corn as only a fore-
runner of the destruction of our “wisely and prudently limited
monarchy l’” There can be no doubt of it. If America sends us
wheat, she will be sure to smuggle republican principles in every sack.
Parents must keep their children from hot-rolls, lest, eating them,
they should catch democracy 1
HOW TO CURE IRELAND.
ARIous attempts have been made, from
time to time, to rectify the disorders
of Ireland ; but they have hitherto
proved wholly unsuccessful. For the
most part, they have consisted in the
empirical administration of steel and
lead, combined with forcible restraint
by means of a strait-waistcoat–a
ZZ practice which may be pronounced to
be the worst of treatment. Hemp,
also, has been largely tried ; but it
has only had the effect of aggra-
- vating the symptoms. Percussion, or
thumping, has been vainly resorted to ; not as a means of diagnosis,
but of cure ; whereas, auscultation, or listening to the patient's com-
plaint, has been almost entirely omitted.
The following is the mode of proceeding we would recommend in this
difficult case :—
First, put the patient on a liberal diet : let one meal be taken three
times a day. The irritation of the system being thus allayed, lose no
time in determining absentee landlords to their proper spheres of action
on the surface of the soil. The most promising measure for this purpose
will be an appeal to the pocket, by the vigorous application of a poor's-
rate. Allay any remaining nervous excitement, resulting from long
mismanagement, by appropriate sedatives. -
Amongst these may be suggested the extract of Monkshood ;
FRIAR’s Balsam may also be applied to old wounds—though these re-
medies, it must be remembered, are dangerous in large quantities. As
the constitution gains strength, the patient may be allowed to take ad-
ditional exercise, in municipal and elective privileges ; all restrictions,
in this respect being gradually relaxed as she progresses towards per-
fect recovery. At the same time, let everything calculated to oppress
the system be removed by a judicious regimen. Any obstinate erup-
tions or malignant; excrescences, arising from vitiated humours, that
may now remain, may, in this improved state of the general health, be
safely removed by legislative operation ; and for the suppression of
any surviving agitation, the strongest antispasmodic in the State Phar-
macopoeia may now be successfully exhibited.
EFFECTS OF FRIGHT.
THE Peers have resolved, at a meeting of the Clarendon, to oppose by
every means the progress of the Corn-Law Bill. The British Lion is
so frightened that he has sent to WAN AMBURGH, applying for a situa-
tion.

T H E S N OBS OF EN G LAN D.
BY ONE OF THEMSELVES.
CHAPTER WI.-ON SOME RESPECTABLE SNOBS.
HAviNg received a great deal of obloquy for dragging monarchs,
princes, and the respected nobility into the Smob category, I trust to
please everybody in the present chapter, by stating my firm opinion
that it is among the RESPECTABLE classes of this vast and happy
empire that the greatest profusion of Snobs is to be found. I pace
down my beloved Baker Street, (I am engaged on a life of BAKER, the
founder of this celebrated Street,) I walk in Harley Street (where
every other house has a hatchment), Wimpole Street, that is as cheerful
as the Catacombs—a dingy Mausoleum of the genteel:—I rove round
Regent's Park, where the plaster is patching off the house-walls;
where Methodist preachers are holding forth to three little children in
the green inclosures, and puffy valetudinarians are cantering in the
solitary mud:—I thread the doubtful zig-zags of May Fair, where
MRs. KITTY LoRIMER's Brougham may be seen drawn up next door
to old LADY LoLLIPOP's belozenged family coach.-I roam through
Belgravia, that pale and polite district, where all the inhabitants look
prim and correct, and the mansions are painted a faint whity-brown:
I lose myself in the new Squares and Terraces of the brilliant bran-
new Bayswater-and-Tyburn-Junction line; and in one and all of these
districts the same truth comes across me. I stop before any house at
hazard, and say, “O house, you are inhabited—O knocker, you are
knocked at—O, undress flunky, sunning your lazy calves as you lean
against the iron railings, you are paid—by Snobs.” It is a tremendous
thought that ; and it is almost sufficient to drive a benevolent mind to
madness to think that perhaps there is not one in ten of those houses
where the “Peerage” does not lie on the drawing-room table. Consi-
dering the harm that foolish lying book does, I would have all the
copies of it burned, as the barber burned all Quixote's books of hum-
bugging chivalry.
Look at this grand house in the middle of the square. The EARL
of LoughcoRRIB lives there : he has fifty thousand a year. A
déjeiner dansant given at his house last week cost, who knows how
much 2 The mere flowers for the room and bouquets for the ladies
cost four hundred pounds : that man in drab trowsers, coming crying
down the steps, is a dun. LoRD LoughcoRRIB has ruined him, and
won't see him ; that is, he is peeping through the blind of his study
at him now. Gothy ways, Loughcorrib, thou art a Snob, a heartless
pretender, a hypocrite of hospitality ; a rogue who passes forged notes
upon society;-but I am growing too eloquent.
You see that fine house, No. 23, where a butcher's boy is ringing the
area-bell. He has three mutton chops in his tray. They are for the
dinner of a very different and very respectable family ; for LADY
SUSAN SCRAPER, and her daughters, Miss Scraper and Miss EMILY
SCRAPER. The domestics, luckily for them, are on board wages—two
huge footmen in light blue and canary, a fat steady coachman who is
a Methodist, and a butler who would never have staid in the family
but that he was orderly to GENERAL Scraper when the General dis-
tinguished himself at Walcheren. His widow sent his portrait to the
United Service Club, and it is hung up in one of the back dressing-
closets there. He is represented at a parlour window with red cur-
tains ; in the distance is a whirlwind, in which cannon are firing off;
and he is pointing to a chart, on which are written the words WAL-
CHEREN, TobAGo.
LADY SUsAN is, as everybody knows by referring to the “British
Bible,” a daughter of the great and good EARL BAGwig before men-
tioned. She thinks everything belonging to her the greatest and best
in the world. The first of men naturally are the BuckRAMs, her own
race : then follow in rank the ScKAPERs. The General was the
greatest General : his eldest son, SCRAPER BUCKRAM Scraper, is at
present the greatest and best ; his second son the next greatest and
best ; and herself the paragon of women.
Indeed, she is a most respectable and honourable lady. She goes to
church of course: she would fancy the church in danger if she did
not. She subscribes to the Church and Parish Charities ; and is a
directress of many meritorious charitable institutions—of QUEEN
CHARLoTTE's Lying-inn Hospital—the Washerwomen's Asylum—the
British Drummers' Daughters' Home, &c. &c. She is a model of a
matron.
The tradesman never lived who could say that his bill was not paid
on the quarter-day. The beggars of her neighbourhood avoid her
like a pestilence ; for when she walks out, protected by John, that
domestic has always two or three Mendicity tickets ready for deserving
objects. Ten guineas a-year will pay all her charities. There is no
respectable lady in all London who gets her name more often printed
for such a sum of money.
Those three mutton chops which you see entering at the kitchen-
door will be served on the family plate at seven o'clock this evening,
the huge footman being present, and the butler in black, and the crest
and coat-of-arms of the Scrapers blazing everywhere. I pity Miss
EMILY Scraper—she is still young—young and hungry. Is it a fact
that she spends her pocket-money in buns 2 Malicious tongues say so ;
but she has very little to spare for buns, the poor little hungry soul I
For the fact is, that when the footmen, and the lady's-maids, and
the fat coach-horses, which are jobbed, and the six dinner-parties in
the season, and the two great solemn evening-parties, and the rent of
the big house, and the journey to an English or foreign watering-place
for the autumn, are paid, my lady's income has dwindled away to a
very small sum, and she is as poor as you or L.
You would not think it when you saw her big carriage rattling up
to the Drawing-room, and caught a glimpse of her plumes, lappets,
and diamonds, waving over her ladyship's sandy hair and majestical
hooked nose:–you would not think it when you hear “LADY SUsAN
ScRAPER's carriage” bawled out at midnight so as to disturb all Bel-
gravia:—you would not think it when she comes rustling into church,
the obsequious John behind with the bag of Prayer-books. Is it pos-
sible, you would say, that so grand and awful a personage as that can
be hard up for money? Alas! so it is.
She never heard such a word as SNoB, I will engage, in this wicked
and vulgar world. And, O stars and garters how she would start if
she heard that she—she, as solemn as MINERVA—she, as chaste as
DIANA (without that heathen goddess's unladylike propensity for field
sports)—that she too was a Snob
A Snob she is, as long as she sets that prodigious value upon her-
self, upon her name, upon her outward appearance, and indulges
in that intolerable pomposity ; as long as she goes parading abroad,
like SolomoN, in all his glory ; as long as she goes to bed—as I
believe she does—with a turban and a bird of Paradise in it, and a
court train to her night-gown ; as long as she is so insufferably virtuous
and condescending ; as long as she does not cut at least one of those
footmen down into mutton-chops for the benefit of the young ladies.....
I had my notions of her from my old schoolfellow, from her son

QIje Neucastle $150largjip.
THE papers of the past week tell us that “the Examina-
tions for the Newcastle Scholarship” have terminated ;
but they failed to supply us with the questions put upon
the interesting occasion. We are, however, enabled to
give a few ; for the agents of Punch—like the spies of
Nichol. As—are everywhere ; albeit, it is hoped, with a
different purpose.
Q. What is your opinion of the Maynooth Grant 2
A. My firm and inextinguishable opinion is, that to the
Maynooth Grant we owe the blight on potatoes.
Q. Define the Anti-Corn Law League.
A. The Anti-Corn Law League has Satan for its head,
and a Republican for its tail.
Q. What will be the result of the admission of foreign
corn into England 2
A. Popery, of course: it will be grown in the wheat.
Corn coming from Catholic countries must necessarily
destroy the Established Church ; as foreign cattle have
brought measles upon tithe-pigs.
Q. What is your opinion of the Condition of England
question ?
A. My opinion of England—leaving out the question—is
this : That having grown out of her glorious institutions,
she is fast approaching destruction. I look upon the
alarming increase of comets as nothing more than a prepa-
ration to burn the country out of the globe.
Q. What value do you attach to the splendid crucifix
sent by the Pope to MR. NEwMAN ?
A. Not being a pawnbroker, I can't say.
A_NEWGATE EXAMPLE.
“MR. PUNCH,
“I AM a very plain man ; even my wife allows
that ; and therefore I want to say a few plain words. I
have to object to an expression used by the Times' gentle-
man that wrote the account of the hanging of Wix. He
says of him, “He bowed to the spectators twice, a proceed-
ing which called forth a tremendous cheer from the
degraded crowd beneath.' Now, sir, I did not cheer; but
I was of the crowd. Am I therefore to think myself
“degraded ?’ Quite the contrary. I went to Newgate to
be taught morals. I'd heard that MR. Davis, the Newgate
ordinary, had preached that hanging did good by the way
of an example ; and not thinking myself a bit better than
my neighbours, I certainly did go to the Old Bailey, as (I
may say) I'd go to à. to be instructed. Indeed, I had
some thoughts of taking my wife and two little boys with
me; for, if a moral example is really taught by the hang-
man, I do think that (if it could be done) there ought
to be accommodation made for all the schools in and near
London. For, if hanging does no good to the living, where-
fore hang 2 If it does good, why am I to be called “de-
graded ' for going to see it 2 Just tell me that ; while I
Itelmalil
“Your obedient Servant,
...“ONE of THE CRowd.”
“P. S. A good many people certainly did cheer; but
some were quite silent—picking pockets.”
WOOLMER v. TOBY.
WE beg leave to state most emphatically that the De-
fendant in this action is not the celebrated dog Toby, of
Punch. Our ToBY is no relative whatever of the unfor.
tunate Toby who has been so severely tickled by the ver-
dict in the recent railway trial. Punch's Toby is not a Stag,
but an exceedingly lucky dog, who never was bitten by
the railway mania.
THE RISE, PROGRESS. AND COMF LETION OF THE
NELSON COLUMN.
THE number three has ever been considered to exercise some mysterious influence
over human destiny. The average life of man is threescore years (and ten); he passes
through the three stages, of growth, maturity, and decay : he is influenced by
three things, pounds, shillings, and pence, and is ruled by three powers, the Sove.
reign, the Lords, and the Commons. It is, therefore, in wonderful analogy with the
ordinary course of human nature, that the NElson Column has at length been
marked by three epochs–First, its wondrous rise; secondly, its miraculously slow
progress; and thirdly, its still more marvellous completion. It is now some very
long number of years ago that a man, in the vigour of maturity, attended by a
THE RISE.
boy of tender age, first placed on the area of Trafalgar Square the hod and the
trowel, the spade and the buckets of industry. How proudly and energetically did
that man advance to the commencement of the great national work, and how fresh
were the words of encouragement spoken to that stripling, who was entering for
the first time on a career of labour ! Determination flashed from the half-winking
eye of the then vigorous man, while hope, not untinctured with fear, earnestness,
which time had not yet hardened into habitual anxiety, played over the features
and gave activity to the gait of that juvenile labourer.
*But we must leave the fresh and balmy atmosphere of hope for the denser air of
its merely partial fulfilment. We must leave the NELsoN Column as it seemed to
promise in the first moment of its rise, and look upon the darker picture of its
tardy progress.
Years had rolled on since that day of high anticipations and ardent aspirations
we have already described, when two forms were seen seated vis-à-vis across the first
stone of a broad-based column. The foaming porter-pot placed between the
figures bespoke rather festivity than labour, while a pipe in either mouth enve-
loped the couple ever and anon in the somniferous fumes of that weed that has
twined itself inseparably in the laurel that adorns the brow of RALEIGH.
Tºlº
*I'm
THE PROGRESS.
The figures are those of a man and a boy ; but a man reckless from sheer laziness,
and a boy with nothing of boyhood left but its brass and its lead—its impudence
and its indolence.

Such was the progress, or, rather, the obstruction of the NELson Column. The
porter-pot occupied the place which the mortar ought to have enjoyed, and the
pipe was wielded by the hand which should have been plying the trowel. Like
NERo, who seized his Straduarius, when he should have clutched his sceptre, the
man and his juvenile myrmidon were fiddling over that column to which an expec-
tant nation looked for the campletion of a trophy worthy of the greatest naval
hero whose name is to be found in human annals.
But we must pass on to the third and last epoch of this strange eventful history.
THE COMPLETION.
And here let us call upon philosophy to read a lesson to the world on the degra-
dation that ever waits on idleness. Behold that very man and boy to whom a
nation once looked with ardent aspirations and hopeful encouragement for the
completion of a great work, now reduced in after years to “chalk the wall,” which
in the shape of an ignoble hoarding, is at once the monument of their shame and
the tomb of their labours. The man bent down by age and humiliation, plies
lazily the paint-brush against the ignoble deal, while the boy—no longer the fresh
and joyous creature who once carried the buckets with an animated and hopeful
step—now stoops, crouches, and almost cowers under the weight of the whitewash.
Let us leave this painful subject, from which we have endeavoured to draw a
healthful moral, to extract, as it were, the sweet of philosophy from the bitter truths
of history.
In conclusion, we can only propose that those three epochs, in which we have
endeavoured to show, in the situation of a moment, the story of a cycle of years,
may be turned into pictures for the base of the NELsoN Column, as a warning to
all future men and boys who may disappoint the expectations of an anxious nation.
There is still a subject wanting for a fourth side. Let us complete the ignomi-
nious history, by inscribing on the fourth side, the shameful fact that the completion
of an English trophy to her greatest naval hero, was due to the humiliating libe-
rality of a Russian despot.
TO THE DAUGHTERS OF “REDUCED GENTLEMEN.”
AGAIN and again have we called upon our readers to admire the benevolence
and loving-kindness of advertisers, as exhibiting themselves in the newspapers.
We give a new case, from the Times of March 27:—
WAN.P. with no salary, on a MERE TRifle, for the sake of a comfortable and res-
pectable home, where she would be treated with the greatest kindness, and her morals at-
tended to, a YoUNG FRENCH PERSON, of the Established Church of England, who can speak
no English, or scarcely any. She would be required to perform no menial office, excepting dressing
and attending to the wardrobes of three little girls; the rest of her time would be occupied in
needlework. She must be able to read her own language well, and to have enough knowledge of
writing and arithmetic to teach children of six or seven years old. The object chiefly being for
the children to have practice in talking French, the less English known the better. If a young
lady, she would often be admitted into the parlour, and would have her meals in the school-room.
Reference as to respectability required. To the daughter of a reduced gentleman this would be a
desirable home. Direct to C. B., Post-office, Exmouth.
It is not very difficult to imagine the sort of “kindness” to be bestowed by
this Samaritan, who, to the daughter of a “reduced gentleman” gives “no salary,
or a mere trifle,” leaving the unfortunate father to supply his child with clothes
and her mite of pocket-money. We can also understand the sort of “morals”
that must be practically taught her; namely, to make the most, by every sort of
pinching and screwing, of miserable dependents; and at the same time to air an
appearance of religion by lisping about the Established Church; to which C. B.,
we presume, is attached—like a whitlow to a bishop's thumb. And then the
sweet leisure proffered to the young French slave 1 After she had taught “the
three little girls” their daily French, she would spend
“the rest of her time” making the little petticoats of
her pupils. If, too, she were a real young lady, she
would be admitted now and then, with the cat, into the
parlour. But like the eat, she would “have her meals"
in another place. Oh, daughters of reduced gentlemen
learn to trundle a mop-to clean knives—black stoves—
polish shoes—forget your books, forget all that may have
educated your taste, your sensibility, be at once sturdy,
healthy housemaids, and flee from the “comfortable and
respectable home” with the “three little girls” proffered
by the C. B.'s of Exmouth.
And now, who is this C. B. 2 Can the Exmouth folks
guess at him or her ? As Englishmen, we would punish
the advertiser for this cold-blooded, deliberate insult,
offered in the basest misery of spirit to the “reduced
gentlemen" of a noble nation. Were we clothed with
Towers of paternal despotism, we would send our benevolent
Janissaries to Exmouth . we would have C. B. searched
| out ; and when found—for his or her insult to France and
to humanity—we would make him or her wear wooden
shoes for a twelvemonth, and every market-day eat a
dinner of frogs in the open market-place. This we would
do, “as we live by bread:”
A song of the Dukes, of the dense old Dukes,
That have rul’d in the land so long ;
With small renown to the Ducal crown,
By dint of legal wrong.
There's rage in their frown when PEEL goes down,
And for Free Trade's cause speaks out ;
And they show him their spite in the Lords each night
That the subject is talk'd about.
Then here’s to the Dukes, to the dense old Dukes,
Who live for themselves alone;
And still live they, though no more to prey
On the country's blood and bone.
They talk of the times when the Christmas chimes
Were a merry sound to hear;
|
|
A Bit of A PARody.
|
|
And pretend that the poor were regaled, galore,
With old English beef and beer.
That tale is all stuff, it is much too tough ;
It won't even hoax an ass;
And don't we know, they who tell us so,
The New Poor Law allow'd to pass 2
Then here’s to the Dukes, to the dense old Dukes,
Who live for themselves alone ;
And still live they, though no more to prey
On the country's blood and bone.
THE HOUSELESS LORDS.
WE understand a Society is in the course of forma-
tion for the purpose of supplying shelter to the houseless
and destitute Parliament. It has been calculated that there
are very near one thousand members of the Legislature
who are actually dependent for shelter upon casual aid,
and who have no other habitation than such as a tem-
porary structure affords to them. Some of those who serve
upon committees are even in a much worse predicament,
and are reduced to the humiliating expedient of clustering
together in attics, kitchens, and even in humble sheds,
thrown together very slightly, with nothing but a piece of
tarpaulin as a roof, to protect them from the inclemency
of the weather. While the destitute poor are being par-
tially provided for by the exertions of the benevolent, it is
to be hoped that the houseless rich will not be altogether
left without assistance in their present pitiable condition.
FRIENDS IN Need.
AN Association has been formed, entitled the “Alleged
Lunatics' Friend Society.” Good news this for the
“Country Party.”
WHAT will THE LoRDs Do? The Nation,

The rights are still chilly; therefore the Militia rºan warms the Red for his Family previous to his going on Guard
CONSTITUTIONAL OPPOSITION.
HAT will the Lords do, when the Corn-
Law question comes before them?
This inquiry rivals, in its uni-
versality, the query as to the
probable observations of MRs.
GRUNDY. It has, however, re-
ceived a partial answer. The
Morning Post states that at a
large meeting of Peers, lately
held at the Clarendon Hotel, it
was unanimously resolved to
oppose the progress of the Go-
vernment Free-Trade measures
in the House of Lords “by every
constitutional means.”
Whether any discussionensued
amongst these noblemen as to
what means of so doing would
be within constitutional bounds,
the Post does not mention ; but
to supply this omission of our odoriferous contem-
we shall venture
porary.
The DUKE of LoAMDALE thought that though what was and what
was not constitutional, might, in the present emergency, be considered
to be neither here northere, yet as there meant another place, and here
their Lordship's own place, it would be preferable to regard what was
constitutional there as being also constitutional here, and consequently
constitutional both there and here.
Viscount FATFIELD congratulated the noble Duke who had just
spoken, on his successful attempt at logic—which was a very fine
specimen of Protectionist logic—and perfectly agreed with him, both
in his premises and conclusion. There was a Roman General of the
name of FABIUs, who, their Lordships would recollect, obtained his
victories by delay. The Fabian system was adopted in the other
place ; he would recommend that it should also be adopted in their
place ; and although Noble Lords are not at Rome, he would advise
them to do as the Romans did.
LoRD CLovERSHAw was of the same opinion with his noble friends.
It was customary, in that other place, to talk against the Government
Measure for from two to four hours at a time. Talk, at any rate, was
strictly constitutional, although it might be all talk. It was said that
the Corn-Laws would be repealed in time. Not while they talked, he
was thankful to say: on the contrary, if they did not talk, those laws
would be repealed in no time.
The MARQUIs of MARLEMONT observed that the Grecian orator DE-
Most HENEs spoke with pebbles in his mouth; which no doubt much im-
proved his Greek. Their Lordships might adopt the like plan ; or, at
least, equivalent arts of debate. Whooping, yelling, and cock-crowing,
were often successfully resorted to in that same other place, and they
might patronise the like expedients; nor did he, for his part, feel it
incompatible with their Lordships' character to bray in defence of
their cause.
LoRD RENTALL felt proud of his moral position. He took his stand
with the discontented Barons. It was the discontented Barons who
carried the Magna Charta; and the same order of nobles would make
the Free-Trade Charter miscarry. The people clamoured for a Bill of
Rights; they had one already; what did they want with another ?
This bill system was most ruinous : their Lordships should maintain
the bill of their own rights, the Corn-Laws. There were two ways of
doing this—by hook or by crook—and both of them, in his opinion,
were perfectly and equally constitutional.
A JOCULAR REGISTER OFFICE.
IN consequence of the great demand for jokes about Easter, for the
use of writers of Burlesques, it has been suggested that a Register
Office should be established, where jokes should be kept on view, either
for sale or hire. As borrowing jokes seems to be the fashionable prac-
|tice in these days, it is presumed that the latter branch of the business,
namely, the lending for hire, will be the most lucrative. It is proposed
to lay in a large stock of jokes every year, and to label them accord.
|ing to their age and condition. Jokes from a week old and upwards
may thus be always had at a moment's notice, and damaged
jokes, allowing for wear and tear, may always be exchanged for a fresher
article. Further particulars will shortly be announced; and in the
| meantime inquiries may be addressed to the Punch Office.

THE FIGHT OF THE CRESCENT. A LAY OF MODERN CAMBRIDGE,
Aº
THE sturdy undergraduates.
Are pouring in amain,
Up thro' the fair Rose Crescent,
The Market-place to gain—
From many a wild wine-party,
From many a sober tea,
From the distant halls of Downing,
And the Courts of Trinity.
From lowly Queen's Quadrangle,
Where muffins are the go ;
From Magd’lene, famed for fast men,"
From Cath'rine, famed for slow ;
From Caius, where anxious proctors
To keep the gates shut try;
From Clare, where Dons chiválrous
Unlock them on the sly.
There be twenty chosen gownsmen,
The foremost of the band,
Pupils of SAMBo SUTToN,
To keep the Crescent stand:
ey can't run if they wish’d it;
Perforce they bear the brunt,
For the gownsmen in the rear-rank
Push the gownsmen in the front.
And all within the Market-place,
And Market-Hill along,
The townsmen, far as words can go,
Come it uncommon strong.
But as yet no nose is bleeding,
As yet no man is down ;
For the gownsmen funk the townsmen,
And the townsmen funk the gown.
When, lo a cad comes brimful
Of bravery and beer—
“To arms 1 to arms . The Borough
Police will soon be here !”
Thro' Market Street, to eastward,
Each townsman turn'd his eye,
And saw the hats and truncheons
Rise fast along the sky.
And plainly and more plainly,
Now may each gownsman know,
By form and face, by port and pace,
Each big blue-coated foe.
There, in the front, fierce FREEstone,
Be-whisker'd, may be seen,
And stalwart SERJEANT SEAmRook,
With buttons bright and sheen;
And BUGGINs, of the mutton fist ;
And MUGGINs, with the fearful twist;
And Hobbs, famed for his waving curls;
And Dobbs, adored by servant girls,
And gruff INSPEctoR GREENE 1
Then out spake a fellow-commoner,
In voice both sad and low,
And darkly look'd he on his friends,
And darkly on his foe:
“They'll be too many for us;
Ten to one against the gown:
Unless we get to Trinity
We'll be wallop’d by the town.”
Then out spake brave FITz-Wiggins,
Though a small college man :
“To keep the Crescent gainst the cads,
I'll do the best I can
And if none will stand beside me,
Alone I'll face the snobs,
Despite fierce FREEstone's truncheon
And the staves of Hobbs or Dobbs' "
Then out spake SIR Tom NoDDY,
A son of Trinity,
“Lo, I will stand at thy right hand,
3 And the Crescent keep with thee.”
And out spake MERRYPEBBLEs—
A Johnian was he—
“I will abide at thy left side,
And the Crescent keep with thee."
A great shout of defiance
From all the snobs arose,
But the three stand calm and silent-
A thumb to every nose !
And forth three Peelers rushing,
Attempt to storm the Pass;
Truncheons are thick, but fists are quick,
And down they go to grass 1
Fitz-WIGGINs floor'd fierce FREESTONE,
ToM Noddy levell'd Hobbs,
And cheerful MERRYPEBBLEs
Black'd both the eyes of Dobbs;
And the aggravated townsmen
Stand all appall'd to see
On the flags the unconscious Peelers-
In the Pass the dauntless Three :
And on the leaguer'd Crescent
Was none would brave attack ;
But those behind cried “Forward ""
And those in front cried “Back!”
* *-*.
º
-
º
Meanwhile their legs the gownsmen
Right manfully have plied;
And now they've got to Trinity,
And the gates are open'd wide.
“Come back, come back, Fitz-W1GGINs,”
Loud cried they from the gate,
“Back Noddy, MERRYPEBBLEs,
Back, or you'll be too late l"
But the police are on them,
And their truncheons fierce they ply ;
Now the Fates save brave Fitz-WIGGINS-
What a terrible black eye —
Though MERRYPEBBLEs' head be
The thickest in the ring,
It scarce can 'scape unbroken ;
Such staves must make it sing.
Alone stood SIR Tom NoDIY,
But constant still in mind,
Policemen pitching in before
And Trinity behind.
“Down with him 1 * cried false SEABROOK,
As he º his bloody face;
“Now yield thee,” cried the Inspector,
Now yield thee, to our grace I"
But brave Tom NoDDY never deign'
An answer ; no not he ;
But he floor'd the Inspector neatly
As a man could wish to see :
And through the storming townsmen
And the irate police,
He fights his passage manfully,
And he wins the gate in peace.
And now, his gown in ribbands,
In the crowded court he stands,
And “to call upon him the next day,”
Receives the Dean's commands.
And then with shouts and clapping,
And hip, hip, hurrah, loud,
He passes on unto his rooms,
Borne by the admiring crowd.
But he was rusticated
By the Dons that very night;
And when he show'd them his black eye,
They said, “It served him right.”
But long at our wine-parties,
We'll remember how, like bricks,
Stout NoDDY kept the Crescent,
In Eighteen-forty-six

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. :

THE POST OFFICE DELAYS.
ost - OFFICE arrangements
are getting slower and
slower every day, while
everything else is getting
on at railroad pace. Where
is EARL ST.GERMANs, who
was to put everything to
rights in notime?—which,
by the way, is a very con-
venient date on which to
make a promise fall due ;
for no time never comes
at all. Where is the Post-
master-General? we again
ask ; for if he does not
manifest himself very
speedily, we will take out
a search-warrant and
search the Post-Office to
see what has become of
him Have they smo-
thered him in the day-
mail, or pelted him to
death with morning news-
papers ? A few days ago
the mail-carts did not
leave the yard of the Post
Office until half-past nine
at night—an hour at
which some of them ought
to have been at the end of
their respective journeys.
If the Post Office people
A can't manage the concern,
let them give it up as a
bad job, and let them
evacuate St. Martin's-le-
Grand at once, instead of
holding the place to the
great detriment of the
commercial and general
community. By some
shocking mismanagement
the letters to the nearest places are the last delivered. As to
Brighton, we have given it up, and never attempt, direct communi-
cation with that place, but always send our letters through a respect-
able firm in Liverpool. We find that by adopting this course, we save
about an hour; for letters directed immediately to Brighton, are
allowed to lie for nearly four-and-twenty hours in repose; in order, we
presume, to allow them to take breath before starting off by the quick
train, or to recover their breath after having arrived by it.
We are happy, to announce increased facilities in the Post-Office
communication between London and Kensington. These places can
now be corresponded with nearly three times in two days ; so that a
Kensington merchant, writing to his London agent on Monday, may
get an answer, in some cases, the next morning. This is a move in
the right direction, and we thank, the EARL OF ST. GERMANs
accordingly. - - -
THE LAW OF RADLWAYS.
THE beautiful uncertainty of the law was never better illustrated
than by the delicious ambiguity that prevails with reference to actions
on the subject of railway liabilities. Every case that comes before a
jury, if the defendant is charged with any liability on account of any
railway, is sure to terminate in a verdict for the plaintiff. A provi-
sional committee-man can recover a deposit from an allottee to-day,
and an allottee may recover it back again from the provisional com-
mittee-man to-morrow. The judges seem to have adopted the old Court
of Requests principle of “How will you pay it 7” in reference to all
claims made upon any person in respect to any railway. Every one is
declared to be liable to every one else ; but it seems to be, at the same
time, perfectly understood that every verdict will be set aside, as a
matter of course, no matter which way it happens to be, or what prin-
ciple it proceeds upon. Any one may have a verdict, to any amount,
upon any ground whatever, provided his demand arises out of some-
thing connected with a railway. The lawyers have hitherto been the
persons to profit by railway speculation, and it seems they are likely
to continue so; for while verdicts are being allotted to all who take the
trouble to ask for them at the hands of a jury, there will naturally be
a strong and general desire to litigate.
PUNCH*S POLITICAL DICTIONARY.
GAME LAws. Game, according to law, includes hares, pheasants,
and a few others ; but there is an old case of a hackney-coach horse
who died game, or, at all events, carried out the gallant resolve of
Macbeth, to “die with harness on his back.” No person can kill game
without a certificate, which proves that he is an individual of “some
mark ; ” but he is nevertheless often very wide of the mark on these
occasions. If the animals shot at were aware of this provision for their
security, they would have the right to call upon the sportsman to pro-
duce his certificate before proceeding to make game of them. A cer- ||
tificate must be taken out annually, and expires in July ; but if a
hare were shot on, the last day of that month, and not to expire until
August, the certificate having expired before the hare, a very nice
question would arise as to the legality of killing him. The landlord
who lets his land, usually reserves the right of killing the game, the #
tenant having the privilege of feeding it. It has been said by Coke,
that the landlord has all the best of the game, which is, for the tenant,
a very losing one. The laws against poaching are very severe, and
extend even to the protection of the eggs of birds of game; so :
that poaching an egg is highly criminal. The preserving of game is
carried to an extent that is often destructive to the tenant.: he is not
allowed to regard self-preservation as the first law of nature, for game
preservation is a paramount obligation.
GAMING, or GAMBLING. A vice declared illegal by an act of the
legislature, but practised by many an act of the legislators in their
private capacity. Gambling was illegal by the Roman law, but ath-
letic exercises might be played at for money; and CAESAR's attempted
achievement of swimming across the Tiber, when he exclaimed,
“Help me, CAssius, or I sink!” was probably a bet between those two
noble Romans.
GARTER, ORDER of THE. The most ancient and illustrious Order of
Knighthood, founded by Edward III. on the occasion of the CountEss
of SALISBURY's stocking having fallen about her heels at a ball, when
the KING picked up a piece of blue ribbon—worn by the Countess
before Indian rubber came into use—amid the laughter of his courtiers.
His Majesty merely replied, Honi soit qui mal y pense, which became
the motto of the Order. There are twenty-five knights, besides the
sovereign, together with about fifteen extra knights, who are princes
or illustrious foreigners. HENRY VIII., who had, like another royal
prince of the present day, a great taste for tailoring, altered the dress
very materially. CHARLEs II., another royal tailor, who was also a
bit of a hatter, put a feather in the cap, which is nearly the only
feather in the cap of this mountebank monarch. Royal Garters appear
to be rather expensive, and must be quoted at £878 a pair, for it
costs £439 to be invested with a single one.
“FOOD FOR POWDER.”
It would seem that recruiting went on but slackly in some of the
provinces ; and therefore the sergeant, like the play-house manager
when business falls off, has had recourse to novel and startling effects.
In the Blackburn Mercury we read of a leash of “dashing sergeants”
with half a regiment of ribanded privates parading the streets, with a
clanging band to catch the unwary. In some instances (names are
given,) the man-trapping shilling has been craftily sneaked into the
hand of the Arcadian, who, when he discovered that he was sold, flung
down the coin, and appealed to the Bench.
Now, Glory is a splendid goddess, no doubt, though she does lay on
the rouge (to hide her scars) a little thick. Nevertheless, let her make
her conquest of the manly heart by the simple beauty of her looks—by
the sweet simplicity of her words—otherwise, Glory loses the purity of
her reputation, and—false one as she is l—is no better than a DALILAH.
Honour to Cobden,
WHEN SIR Robert PEEL shall have safely effected a repeal of the
Corn-Laws, we hope that he will not ‘forget to assign glory where
glory is due ; and that whilst he is mindful of our Indian triumphs, he
will not overlook those achieved in England under the banners of Frce
Trade. We expect, therefore, that he will move a vote of thanks to
MR. Cobden and his gallant League, for those brilliant successes in
the war against the Monopolists ; and we think the resolution might.

WHEN LoRD BRough AM said there was no more dependence to be
placed on BARRY's promises than on a broken reed, he was not perhaps
aware that it was really REID, and not BARRY, that acted as a barrier
to the completion of the Houses of Parliament. Since it has been
discovered that REID is the culprit, the following melody has been
expressly written for LoRD BROUGHAM, who has sung it twice at the
Beef Steak Club, with considerable gusto.
AIR-" Home, succet home.”
“’Nſid Westminster's palace, while REID still shall roam,
The Lords will ne'er taste of the blessings of home ;
If BARRY e'er tries the new house to prepare,
His efforts by REID are all blown into air.
REID, REID, Doctor REID !
Of all great mistakes, there is not one like REID.
“While exil'd from home, all my speeches seem vain;
Oh give me my old House of Commons again.
The ‘cheers’ and the “hears, once my own I could call ,
Give me them, or that sack of wool, dearer than all.
REID, REID,” &c.
A CITY WAGHORN WANTED.
WE have serious thoughts of making arrangements with LIEUTENANT
WAGHoRN—we know we must do the thing liberally, but we are
prepared for that—to convey our West End expresses to the Punch
Office. The constant blockades of the City render it absolutely
necessary that some shorter, or at all events, some more uninterrupted
passage should be found between the East and the West, than that old
civic territory which seems to be always in the hands of a hostile
Paving Board. -
Seeing what LIEUTENANT WAGHoRN has done for the Indian route,
we think it probable that he might succeed in shortening the passage
between Charing Cross and the Eastern quarters of the Metropolis.
We know the thing is only to be done by extreme energy on one hand,
and boundless liberality on the other; but if LIEUTENANT WAGHoRN =
strains his nerves, and we write our cheques with a liberal hand, we
have every hope of accomplishing this great national object. .
It is a mournful fact that, under the present system, there is always
as much excitement about omnibuses over-due, as there is when delay
arises with reference to the arrival of an Indian Mail-packet. Some
of the omnibuses are actually and entirely “lost,” as far as their
intended passengers are concerned; for the vehicles are frequently
compelled to put back, when they happen to be empty, in order to
arrive at the end of their back journey according to the time allowed
them. Thus the omnibus is wholly “lost” to those who are waiting
for its arrival at the Bank to return by it.
We feel convinced that WAGHoRN is the only man to establish the
Great Eastern and Western passage, in the style of completeness and
despatch which such an important thoroughfare requires.
As we write, the whole eastern portion of the Strand is in a state of
complete blockade. Barristers, when they wish to go down to West-
minster Hall to attend Parliamentary Committees, find themselves
suddenly on the circuit—the most unprofitable circuit in existence,—
namely, the North-Western, all the way along Chancery Lane, and
down the greater part of Holborn.
The Early Closing Movement.
ToM THUMB intends to present a petition to Parliament, praying
that he may not work more than twelve hours a-day. His petition sets
forth that he has for the last month been giving at the Egyptian Hall
three and four levees a-day, besides having to support the weight.of a
funny burlesque every night at the Lyceum. The consequence is, that
he never gets to bed before one o'clock, and that he is losing flesh consi-
derably, in consequence of the enormous quantity of hard work he is
made to go through. He hopes the Legislature will take his case into
merciful consideration, and pass an enactment specifying the number of
hours a dwarf shall be compelled to labour every day. DoN ARTURO
Roebucco, with a fine fellow-feeling, has kindly consented to present
the petition. -
NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.
THERE was a report that the Bellerophon, after being got ready in
sixty hours, and again got unready, had been once more submitted ...)
the operation of rigging. Upon inquiry, the rumour turned out to be
perfectly correct, but it appeared at the same time that the last rigging
the Bellerophon underwent, was in Punch.

In justice to the less offensive inmates of the establishment, Pro-

Tuft-Hunters and Toadies will enjoy, without any additional charge,
the exclusive privilege of waiting on and performing all the most

them an infinite source of innocent gratification.
GoLIAH LoNGMAN respectfully entreats such gentlemen as are desirous
of securing for their friends the advantages of his Asylum, that they
will make early application for that purpose, as he feels convinced,
from a careful perusal of the Protectionist speeches lately delivered in
Parliament, that nearly all the most distinguished defenders of the
Corn-Laws will be placed, by their well-wishers or next of kin, under
restraint in his establishment the moment the measure at present under
agitation is finally disposed of.

and the same awful precipices for little children to fall into. At night,
the scene is concealed from the eye, save where a sickly lantern throws
a lurid glare over the brawny pipes that span the horrid depths of the
treacherous chasm. The scene is one which SALVAton Rosa would
have delighted to paint; but upon us the wildness of the locality has
always a different effect. We hurry away from it as fast as we can,
for fearvof tumbling into it.

NICHOLAS AND THE NUNS.
ETRAYED by the serious speech of Lord
ABERDEEN, and in a moment of weakness,
we suffered ourselves to be beguiled into a
sort of sympathy with the EMPERoR Nicho-
LAs ; who, as we conceived, had been un-
justly accused of cruelties towards the
Basilian Nuns. We here beg leave most
emphatically to renounce any good opinion
soever entertained towards the Evil One
of Russia. The history of his tyranny is
as true as the human life, destroyed by the
atrocity of his servants, and now—with
who shall say how many other lives 7–
Nººcrying against him at the bar of God.
It is impossible to refuse credence to the
narrative of the horrors suffered by the
Nuns of Minsk, a narrative just published
by our neighbour, MR. Bogue. The letter
of ANN BIRT to the Times—the letter in which the lady deposes to
having seen the outraged Abbess, having heard the horrors of her
suffering—is also damning evidence against the late imperial visitor
to Rome.
Very seldom, indeed, does Punch venture upon the review of a
book, but this Narrative he especially recommends to the consideration
of those fair ladies—those female lilies—of the fashionable world, those
high English wives, sisters, and mothers, who thronged about Nicholas |
when in London, as about some health-giving shrine,—who were in a
flutter of rapture when the “dear Emperor” only smiled upon them.
In this Narratire they will learn how, under orders of the sweet
potentate, the nuns were chained, and stripped, and flogged, and given
up to the Cossacks,—but no, we must pass some of the atrocities,<
and were, at least very many of them, tortured out of life. The
subjoined extracts may be found of especial interest to some of the
patronesses of ALMAcks, and devout admirers of “that love of an
Emperor.”
“At the end of about two months (1838) began the punishment of flogging, which they
made us submit to twice a week; S1EMAszko's orders were thirty lashes, but Michale-
wicz added twenty on his own account. . . . There was no need to hold us ;
the cross of Jesus Christ was enough to restrain us from stirring under the blows which
bruised our bodies. All the time this torture endured, we seemed to behold our Lord
aten with stripes, and this spectacle took away from us all feeling of pain. What most
afflicted us was, that we were beaten quite naked.” -
There is, however, every ºvariety of torture, from the simple
knocking out of teeth to the baking alive in an oven . We, however,
indicate the crowning horror:-
“They sent us in from our work earlier, than usual, and our prison was immediately
invaded by a crowd of drunken and ferocious barbarians! Ah! what a sad and dreadful
hour ! Whoever had seen it would not desire to survive! True hell ' ' How frightful
is the recollection' to describe it were impossible! They fell upon us as if they were
mad., Who could count the blows, the bites, the rendings.” They trampled upon us—
they crushed us * º * * * -" Who can comprehend our groans and our
burning sobs . . . . . The howlings and the blasphemies of our executioners : The
assistance that our divine spouse vouchsafed us at this moment exasperated their rage:
they bit us, they scratched with their nails, they tore us in pieces. . In the twinkling of
an eye our blood inundated the prison. Two of our sisters were crushed under foot;
eight had their eyes torn out and their faces mutilated, all were horribly bruised. At
last the monsters, wearied and covered with our blood, went away.”
Now, to the fair ladies who kissed the hand of Nicholas, and who
basked in the lustre, imperial lustre of his eyes, we say—buy this
Narratire. We may safely add, in the review slang of the day, that
“their libraries cannot be complete without it.”
".
Proper Resentment.
HER MAJESTY laughed so heartily at WIDDIcoxib, and BARRY the
clown, on her late visit to Astley's, that the joke against them behind
the scenes has been, that they are sure to be elevated to the Peerage.
WIDDIcoxib gets into a rage whenever the subject is mentioned ; but
BARRY only laughs, and, with a fine spirit of loyalty, says, “No 1 no
i.sure HER MAJESTY doesn't wish to make me a greater fool than I
ook.”
CAUSE AND EFFECT.
ONE day last week the only thing to be seen on the Opposition
benches, when MR. FINCH and other Protectionists were haranguing,
was MR. Hawes' hat. We felt strongly inclined to pity this poor hat,
only we have been informed that, like everything else that listens to
the Agriculturists, it enjoyed a very good nap.

SCRAPER's. The fine mansion with
the awning over the door: that canopy
will be let down this evening for
* the comfort of the friends of SIR
ALURED and LADY S. DE MogYNs,
whose parties are so much admired by
the public, and the givers themselves.
Peach-coloured liveries laced with
silver, and pea-green plush inexpres-
sibles render the DE MogYNs' flunkies
the pride of the ring when they appear
in Hyde Park, where LADY DE Mo-
GYNs, as she sits upon her satin
cushions, with her dwarf spaniel in
her arms, only bows to the very se-
lectest of the genteel. Times are al-
tered now with MARY ANNE, or, as
she calls herself, MARIAN DE Mogy Ns.
She was the daughter of CAPTAIN FLAck, of the Rathdrum Fen-
cibles, who crossed with his regiment, over from Ireland to Caermar-
thenshire ever so many years ago, and defended Wales from the
Corsican invader. The Rathdrums were quartered at Pontydwdlm,
where MARIAN wooed and won her DE MogyNs, a young banker in the
place. His attentions to Miss FLAck at a race ball were such, that
her father said DE MogYNs must either die on the field of honour, or
become his son-in-law. He preferred marriage. His name was Mug-
GINs then, and his father—a flourishing banker, army-contractor,
smuggler, and general jobber—almost disinherited him on account
of this connexion. There is a story that MUGGINs the Elder was
made a baronet for having lent money to a R-y-l p-rs-n-ge. I do not
believe it. The R-y-1 Family always paid their debts, from the PRINCE
of WALEs downwards. -
Howbeit, to his life's end he remained simple SIR Thomas Muggins'
representing Pontydwdlm in Parliament for many years after the war'
The old banker died in course of time, and, to use the affectionate
phrase common on such occasions, “cut up” prodigiously well. His son,
ALFRED SMITH MogyNs, succeeded to the main portion of his wealth,
and to his titles and the bloody hands of his scutcheon. It was not
for many years after that he appeared as SIR ALURED MogYNs SMYTH
DE MogYNs, with a genealogy found out for him by the Editor of
Fluke's Peerage, and which appears as follows in that work —
“De Mogwns. SnR ALURED Mogyns SMyth, 2nd Baronet. This gentleman is a
representative of one of the most ancient families of Wales, who trace their descent
until it is lost in the mists of antiquity. A genealogical tree beginning with SHEM is in the
possession of the family, and is stated by a legend of many thousand years' date to have
been drawn on papyrus by a grandson of the patriarch himself. Be this as it may, there
can be no doubt of the immense antiquity of the race of Mogyns.

Rome, and Paris. They got a royal prince to attend their soirées at
the latter place, and it was here that they first appeared under the name
of DE MogyNs, which they bear with such splendour to this day.
All sorts of stories are told of the desperate efforts made by the
indomitable LADY DE MogYNs to gain the place she now occupies, and
those of my beloved readers who live in middle life, and are unac-
quainted with the frantic struggles, the wicked feuds, the intrigues,
cabals, and disappointments which, as I am given to understand, reign
in the fashionable world, may bless their stars that they at least are
not fashionable Snobs. The intrigues set afoot by the De MogyNs, to
get the DUCHEss of Buckskin to her parties, would strike a TALLEY-
RAND with admiration. She had a brain fever after being disap-
pointed of an invitation to LADY ALDERMANBURY's thé dansante, and
would have committed suicide but for a ball at Windsor. I have the
following story from my noble friend LADY CLAPPERCLAw herself—
LADY KATHLEEN O'SHAUGHNessy that was, and daughter of the EARL
of TURFANTHUNDER.—
“When that ofous disguised Irishwoman, LADY MUGGINs, was strug-
gling to take her place in the world, and was bringing out her hidjous
daughter BLANCHE,” said old LADY CLAPPERCLAw “(MARIAN has a
hump-back and doesn't show, but she's the only lady in the family)—
when that wretched Polly MUGGINs was bringing out BLANCHE, with
her radish of a nose, and her carrots of ringlets, and her turnip for a
face, she was most anxious—as her father had been a cowboy on my
father's land—to be patronised by us, and asked me point-blank, in the
midst of a silence at Count Vol.AUVENTs, the French Ambassador's
dinner, why I had not sent her a card for my ball 2
“‘Because my rooms are already too full, and your ladyship would
be crowded inconveniently,” says I; indeed she takes up as much
room as an elephant; besides, I wouldn't have her, and that was flat.'
“I thought my answer was a settler to her : but the next day she
comes weeping to my arms—"Dear LADY CLAPPERCLAw,’ says she,
‘it’s not for me; I ask it for my blessed BLANCHE a young creature
in her first season, and not at your ball ! My tender child will pine
and die of vexation. I don't want to come. I will stay at home to
nurse SIR ALURED in the gout. MRs. BolsTER is going, I know ; she
will be BLANche's Chaperon.”
“‘You wouldn't subscribe for the Rathdrum blanket and potato
fund ; you, who come out of the parish,” says I, ‘and whose grand-
father, honest man, kept cows there.'
“‘Will twenty guineas be enough, dearest LADY CLAPPERCLAw º'
“‘Twenty guineas is sufficient,” says I, ‘and she paid them ; so I
said, ‘BLANCHE may come, but not you, mind;’ and she left me with
a world of thanks.
“Would you helieve it?—when my ball came the horrid woman made
her appearance with her daughter! “Didn't I tell you not to come º'
said I, in a mighty passion. “What would the world have said P’
cries my LADY MUGGINs ; “my carriage is gone for SIR ALURED to
the Club ; let me stay only ten minutes, dearest LADY CLAPPERCLAw.’
“‘Well, as you are here, Madam, you may stay and get your supper,'
I answered, and so left her, and never spoke a word more to her all night.
““And now,” screamed out old LADY CLAPPERCLAw, clapping her
hands, and speaking with more brogue than ever, “what do you
“In the time of BoADick A, Hogyn Mogwn, of the hundred Breves, was a suitor and
a rival of CARAct Acus for the hand of that Princess. He was a person gigantic in sta- |
ture, and was slain by SUEtonius in the battle which terminated the liberties of Britain.
From him descended directly the PRINces of Ponty DwdlM. Mogwn of the Golden
Harp, (see the Mabinogion of LADY CHARLorrs Guest,) Bogv|N-MERodAc-AP-
Mogy N, (the black fiend son of MogyN.) and a long list of bards and warriors, celebrated
both in Wales and Armorica. The independent Princes of Mogy N long held out against
the ruthless Kings of England, until finally GAM Mogwns made his submission to
PRINCE HENRY, son of HENRY IV., and under the name of Sir David GAM DE
Moowns, was distinguished at the battle of Agincourt. From him the present Baronet
is descended. (And here the descent follows in order until it comes to Thomas Mug-
GINs, first Baronet of Pontydwdlem Castle, for 23 years Member of Parliament for that
borough, who had issue, ALURED Mogyns SMyth, the present Baronet, who married

“Arms-a mullion garbled, gules on a saltire reversed of the second. Crest—a tom-tit
rampant regardant. Motto-Ung Roy ung Mogyns.”
It was long before LADY DE MogyNs shone as a star in the fashion-
able world. At first, poor MUGGINs was in the hands of the FLAcks,
the CLANCYs, the Tooles, the SHANAHANs, his wife's Irish relations ;
and whilst he was yet but heir apparent, his house overflowed with
claret and the national nectar, for the benefit of his Hibernian relatives.
ToM TUFto absolutely left the street in which they lived in London,
because, he said, “it was infected with such a confounded smell of
whisky from the house of those Irish people.”
It was abroad that they learned to be genteel. They pushed into
all foreign courts, and elbowed their way into the balls of Ambassa-
dors. They pounced upon the stray nobility, and seized young lords
travelling with their bear leaders. They gave parties at Naples,
think, after all my kindness to her, the wicked, vulgar, odious, impu-
dent, upstart of a cowboy's granddaughter, has done?—she cut me
yesterday in Hy’ Park, and hasn't sent me a ticket for her ball to-
night, though they say PRINCE GEORGE is to be there.'
Yes, such is the fact. In the race of fashion the resolute and
active De MogyNs has passed the poor old CLAPPERCLAw. Her pro-
gress in gentility may be traced by the sets of friends whom she has
courted, and made, and cut, and left behind her. She has struggled
so gallantly for polite reputation that she has won it ; pitilessly
kicking down the ladder as she advanced, degree by degree.
Her Irish relations were first sacrificed ; she made her father dine
in the Stewards' room, to his perfect contentment; and would send
SIR ALURED thither likewise, but that he is a peg on which she hopes
to hang her future honours ; and is, after all, paymaster of her daugh-
ter's fortunes. He is meek and content. He has been so long a gen-
tleman that he is used to it, and acts the part of Governor very well.
In the daytime he goes from the Union to Arthur's, and from Arthur's
to the Union. He is a dead hand at picquet, and loses a very comfort-
able maintenance to some young fellows, at whist, at the Traveller's.
His son has taken his father's seat in Parliament, and has of course
joined Young England. He is the only man in the country who believes
in the DE MogyNses, and sighs for the days when a DE MogxNs led
the van of battle. He has written a little volume of spoony puny
poems. He wears a lock of the hair of LAUD, the Confessor and
Martyr, and fainted when he kissed the Pope's toe at Rome. He sleeps
in white kid gloves, and commits dangerous excesses upon green tea.

YEOMANRY MOUSTACHIOS.
THE DUKE of BEAUFort—having the efficient defence of his coun-
try at heart—has issued an order to that invincible corps, the Gloucester
Yeomanry Cavalry, to wear moustachios. The idea, if original,
would no doubt be received by an intelligent generation, as very bril-
A suspicion of plagiary, however, dims its lustre; for the KING
of HANoveR-having blown out the torch of Hymen in his army—has
just published a manifesto, in which he takes their beards into his pater-
nal keeping. He has ordered that henceforth his soldiers should wear
their moustachios in the form of a scythe ; such form, we presume,
being indicative to the ranks of the enemy, of an efficient mowing-
down. It will be seen by the subjoined order of the day, that this idea
has not been lost upon the DUKE of BEAUFoRT :—
“Companions in Arms and Veterans of Beeswing !—Alive to the
machinations of America and the envy of France, it is necessary that
we should put the boldest face possible upon the danger that may
threaten us, for which purpose it is my desire that every man (capable
of growing the same) shall from the appearance of this order (whether
his wife likes it or not) discontinue to shave his upper lip, letting his
moustachios grow in the form of a carving-knife.
“To men, conversant as you all are with C.Esar's De Bello Callico,
it would be impertinent in me, your Commander, to dilate upon the
moral and martial uses of moustachios. Your gallant ancestors, the
ancient Britons, knew the tremendous use of hair; and, like Britons,
refused to shave accordingly. You will therefore prove yourselves
worthy of that noble race by the use of your swords and disuse of your
razors.
“Should the hour arrive when the foot and horse of an invading
army should desecrate the shores of England, I need not dilate upon the
inconceivable utility of moustachios.
England may be preserved by hairs 1
“Therefore, comrades, Gloucestershire expects her Yeomanry will
from this day wear moustachios I

FRENCH ROMANCES.
WE really begin to believe there is no such person as ABD-EL-KADER.
Like Monsieur THIERs's “Consulat et l'Empire,” he is nothing better
than a clever fiction. Let us ask what proof is there of his existence,
further than the bulletins of MARSHAL BUGEAUD 7 Take away ABD-
El-KADER, and you shoot his horse for ever. Besides, if it is once
proved there is no ABD-El-KADER, there is an end to all razzias—no
more camels, no more sheep captured—no more victories, and, alas ! no
more glory—and how is a Frenchman to live without glory? He has
been accustomed to it all his life. No, ABD-El-KADER is kept alive to
tickle the badawds. He is the Hero of the Gobémouches. He is literally
one of the “Mysteries of Paris.” In a word, he is the Mrs. Harris of

WE very much regret that a severe cold, caught in a crush to see
the Human Tripod, did not permit us to quit the Pecks NIFFERY in
sufficient time to continue our tour in our last. Since then we have
tripped it in an express train to Manchester, and have been especially
delighted with the improvement manifested by MEsses. CoMFIT and
BULLSEYE at their artistic pastry establishment, corner of Lollipop
Lane, Manchester. These gentlemen, with truly Manchester-like
liberality, flung open their doors to us, and it did our taste, our pa-
triotism, exceeding good to mark the greatimprovement in their designs.
A few of the old sweetmeats, sucked by the wisdom of our ancestors,
compared with the new patterns, will at once display the triumphant
advance of MEssRs. CoMFIT and BULLSEYE. Let us instance the sub-
joined Brown Donkey, no doubt very familiar to the barley-sugar days
of our readers :—

Now, if there ever was anything calculated to mislead and stuitify
the intellect of a child in its early knowledge of asses, it must be a
shapeless thing, like the above. It is no wonder that many of our
ancestors tolerated donkeys so long among them, without ever knowing
them to be such. People grew old and died, and scarcely knew asses
when they saw them. How fortunate, then, are the babies of our day,
who have a faithful, spirited design like that we now subjoin—a design
which does equal honour to the hearts and heads of MEssRs. CoMFIT

Let us again consider the Hunters, familiar to our infant months, and
then glance at the Hunters offered to the digestion of our children :-
old style.
Can anything be well more shapeless, more unmeaning than the old
pattern ? Is it not to insult the understanding of a six months' babe
to present such a thing to it as a huntsman mounted ? Whereas, in
the new pattern we recognise a reality, a fire about the horse that
very much reminds us of the steed of CHANTREY ; whilst the rider has
a D'ORSAY-like air, well known to the sportsmen of Leicestershire.
In the new pattern we see everything calculated to animate and inspire
a baby. Indeed, we speak from facts. We presented it to the vision
of a little thing just short-coated, and the baby jumped, and clapped
its hands, and chuckled its little tongue, showing every disposition to
ride. This is, indeed, to make art ministrant to instruction—to make
even cakes call forth the latent energies of the infant soul.
The chanticleer in small clothes, is a well-known piece of pastry.
Dutch gilt, it gleams gorgeously amidst spice-nuts and gingerbread at
wakes and fairs. Yet, with all its splendour, how barbarous is the
old design—how spirited the character of the new :
The bird of the olden time is a mockery, a delusion, and a snare —

WANTED, A TESTIMONIAL, BY COBBETT's GHOST.
“PEEL, “The Shades.
“So you have come round to my way of thinking. Did I not,
years ago, long before I died and left all you statesmen and legislators
floundering in the mud–in which mud the last member of the House of
Commons that arrived in these Shades tells me you are still sprawling
—did I not, I say, week by week, publish and proclaim regularly in my
Register (a hundred thousand copies of which circulated weekly in this
country, and as many in America), the immense value and importance,
as an article of food, of Maize or Indian Corn? And did I not as often
denounce and hold up to the execration of mankind that abominable
|
body-stuffing and soul-destroying root, that hog-food, the Potato ?
Oh I and now you have introduced Maize or Indian Corn into Ireland
as provision for the famishing population of that country. And you,
on your legs, in your place in the Commons' House of Parliament, have
declared your hope that the Irish will now acquire a taste for a higher
species of food. Yes ; but you have forgotten to mention the circum-
stance that this higher species of food is MY Corn. It was very conve-
nient to you, I daresay, to forget this circumstance, but it is convenient
to me to put you in mind of it—or at least to put the people of England
in mind of it, that I may not, PEEL, be choused and diddled by you
out of that credit which is justly due to me.
“No doubt, you would like to lead people by the nose, and persuade
them that You have found out a remedy for the complaints of Ireland;
whereas, the remedy is MY remedy, and I wonder that even You have
the brass to try and pass it off for yours. But do not you flatter
yourself that you will succeed in this base attempt ; and, since you
certainly will not succeedin it, you had better at once, with a good grace,
confess that you are indebted to ME for the discovery of your Irish
physic. I do not much care, indeed, to be stuck up as a marble
image, to be stared at by a set of gaping people ; but as you are going
to have a parcel of such images in your new Houses of Parliament, and
as I do not see how you can now recompense me in any other way, I
think you may as well put mine among them. If this is the most you
can do, it is also the least you can do. But don't rig me out in any of
your Roman togas. Represent me in my pepper-and-salt coat, and
waistcoat and drab breeches, trampling a heap of potatoes under foot,
and holding a number of my Register, (a hundred thousand copies of
which circulated weekly in this country, and as many in America,) in
one hand, and a blade of My Corn (which you want to call yours) in
the other.

THE Limerick Chronicle says:–
“A letter from an officer engaged in the Aliwal affair observes that it was a superb
sight to see the 16th Lancers with the native cavalry breaking through the Khalsa square,
the former cutting up their opponents at every side. Rich shawls and gold bracelets
without end fell into the hands of the victors.”
Glory is, no doubt, a superb person. But even glory (like a fine
woman) must be very much set off by a rich shawl and brăcelets of
gold. And thus the adornments of Glory are made more captivating
than the nakedness of Truth.

LANDLORD EJECTMENT IN
(FRoºt our own Reporten.)
“Castle Dunbilk, April 1st, County Cork.
RoM the day I set foot in this unhappy country, I have seen many a sight
of misery, but that in the midst of which I am now writing exceeds
everything I could have conceived. Talk of the oppressions of the Irish
cottier 1 Read my letter, and then think of the sufferings of the Irish
landlord.
“Several ejectments of this much-maligned class having taken place in
this county, I proceeded to the spot in obedience to your instructions.
The scene was heart-rending.
“SIR DonATUs DUNBILK, with his amiable lady and lovely family,
had just been ejected under circumstances of peculiar atrocity and a
writ of fifa and elegit. By the former, the goods and chattels of the
unfortunate baronet have been seized by his rapacious creditors; while by
the latter his lands and castle (in which the family had resided since
STRoNGBow) are torn from their possessors, and they are left to the
mercies of a Boulogne Hotel-keeper, or a Baden Gasthoff.
“I repaired to the scene of devastation. The sale was concluded just
before my arrival. In the court-yard stood SIR Don ATUs's travelling
carriage, (which had with difficulty been secured from the general
wreck,) ready packed. SIR DonATUs himself, a fine portly man with a red
= nose, was smoking a cigar disconsolately, as he waited, with impatience,
the arrival of his lady, who was dressing.
“I entered into conversation with the venerable and outraged old
man, and subjoin some passages, which, better than any speculations of mine, will let you into the
secret of the misery now prevailing in this unhappy country. This is, the rapacity of creditors, and the
utter disregard to the natural rights of the landlords to unlimited credit, founded on the length of time they have
gone on without paying their bills.
“‘A fine morning, SIR Donatus,' I remarked, respectfully raising my hat.
“‘Mighty fine, Sir, for thravelling,’ was his courteous reply; but a heavy sigh betrayed his inward
agony at thus abandoning the home of his forefathers.
““So you're going to leave Castle Dunbilk 2' I asked, in an offhand way.
“‘Blur' and 'ouns, Sir, I can't stop. They've sould me up, the villains : horse and hounds, Sir,
cellar and stud—all gone !’ and he sighed again.

he took several rapid whiffs of his

distinguishes the son of Erin, I was
disgusted to observe the heartless

alluded to the mournful event, and
mocked the old man in his degra-

THE NUNS OF MINSK.—TABLEAUX WIWANS.
E understand that several dis-
tinguished lady leaders of
fashion—the Morning Post
has been strangely silent on
the matter—have within the
past week got up certain
Tableaur Virans (how very
nicely a bit of strong, ner-
vous French buttresses up
the weakness of English ')
intended, just for the novelty
of the thing, to convey a
great moral lesson. The
ladies—all of them Shining
Ones of ALMAck's — have
taken the subjects of their
Tableaua from the account of
the persecutions of the Nuns
of Minsk, the truth of which
has now the imprimatur of a
Roman Cardinal, deep in the
Basilian mysteries. Theladies,
who have originated these touching spectacles, mightily distinguished
themselves at the time of the EMPERoR of Russia's visit, by their
adoration of the Imperial Goul. Heaven had never before made such
a wonder of a man, and it was to see something like heaven only to
look upon him. The murmur of his voice was an Open Sesame to
all hearts—even to hearts not given to the opening mood—and the
pressure of his hand a foretaste of Paradise. Well, it appears that
these ladies have been visited by a sort of remorse. Not the vulgar,
inconsiderate kind of remorse, that annoys common people; sticking
thorns through their cotton nightcaps, and making “hedgepigs of
their pillows;” but a gentle, lady-like sort of remorse ; tapping their
feelings even as they—the white and rosy loves ſ—would with fan or
glove rebuke some naughty man. Hence, from this polite remorse
have we the Polish Tableaua Vicans; that, it is expected, will in a
very little while make the Nuns of Minsk as popular in high life, as
was erst their imperial taskmaster. Indeed it would not surprise us
—to be sure, the Russian Ambassador might effectually remonstrate—
if MR. LUMLEY, with an eye to the gratification of his patrons,
should reproduce the Nuns in a ballet. However, without speculating
on the future, let us record the past. It was, no doubt, bad, very
inconsiderate, very naughty of Duchesses and Marchionesses to make
so much of a most delicate monster : nevertheless, what would be a
crime in a mantua-maker, is but a peccadillo in a high lady: for, as
singeth the Byron of poetesses (one who subtly knows every bit of
paint, and how laid on the human porcelain), for
“The rugged path of sinners (greatly smooth'd by giving dinners)
Can be paved and rail'd away for the feet of finer clay.”
a wickedness committed in Covent Garden, is only a weakness in
May Fair.
The following are a few of the Tableaua presented by ladies, whose
names it is not necessary to give. It may suffice to state that they
were among the most energetic idolaters (sweet fanatics ) of the
Emperor.
TABLEAU L–The Soldiers driving the Nuns from the altar of their Church.
(“There were thirty-five of us, and when the soldiers received the order to drive us
from the Church, thirty-four rose up; the thirty-fifth lay dead before the Host.”—
Narrative, p. 14.)
This Tableau was most admirably represented. It was wholly
designed by a distinguished Duchess, much smiled upon by the
Emperor. The Duchess herself represented Rosal.IE LANszEcKA, the
dead nun. Nothing could be finer than the mingled expression of
earthly grief and seraphic joy as depicted by the Duchess. It was
most touching; and (when it found it) absolutely thrilled the heart of
fashionable life. The Duchess would have made a fine actress!
TABLEAu IL–The Nuns at Witebsk, breaking stones and wheeling barrows.
(". At abr we were conducted to our hard labour, which varied according to the season.
At first they made us break stones, and draw them in wheel-barrows, to which we were
chained.”—p. 20.)
This scene had a prodigious effect on the beholders. Tears—quite
as bright as the diamonds of the weepers, and, as rarity gives value,
quite as precious—tears flowed from many brilliant eyes. We might
allude to the dignity which the MARCHIoness of threw about
her wheelbarrow, but we know that any such eulogy would but offend
a modesty, a gentleness, that she has made a proverb.
TABLEAU-III.-The Nuns carrying water from the river for the use
of the Czernicks.
(“We carried this water in very heavy copper jars with outstretched arms, lest, as they
said, “the Polish spirit should pass into the water.’”—p. 29.)
Very admirably was this group composed. The Countess of
represented the Abbess. Her acting was perfect. It was impossible
to discover, in the resigned, the almost beatific look, and the morally
noble demeanour of the actress for the time, any touch of the manner
of the true Countess —
“All the greater idolising—all the weaker tyrannising:
Now with knees on stiffen'd hinges—now with servile supple cringes.”
There was not a jot of this. It was, for the time, all Abbess, and
nothing of Countess.-
TABLEAU IV.-The Nuns at work, constructing Siemaszko's palace.
(“It was necessary to draw up to the third floor buckets full of lime; these bucket
were extremely heavy, and only one sister at a time was employed at this work.”—p. 38.
The youthful LADY represented the working nun. The
ineffable sweetness of her look—her angelic patience—physical suf-
fering, chastened and elevated by moral will—all was exquisite,
keenly affecting. Had LADr. not already beamed in The Book
of Beauty, she would certainly be there (in the habit of a nun) in the
Book for 1847.
We have now described a sufficient number of the Tableaux to indi-
cate the spirit and fine taste with which they are produced by the
late worshippers of Nicholas. There is something very fine, very
magnanimous in thus embodying the acts of the EMPERoR, and thereby
showing his true claim to the respect and affection of the aristo-
cracy of England.
We understand that at the approaching Polish Ball several ladies of
distinction will attend, dressed as the Nums of Minsk.
THE WAR OF THE ALLOTTEES.
It is with considerable regret we have come to the conclusion that
war must be the result of the position of the Allottees and the Provi-
sional Committee-men. The boundary line is a mere merry-thought
compared with the enormous bone of contention furnished by the railway
lines all over the country. Protocols have passed between the opposing
sections for several months, and treatises have indeed been signed which
the contracting parties now openly repudiate. Everything has been
done in the way of remonstrance and threat, to prevent the actual com-
mencement of hostilities, but all apparently in vain, for a blow has at
length been struck, and an action has positively taken place at Exeter.
We are almost reminded of the struggles of the French Revolution by
these sad encounters which are now on all sides threatening. WoolMER,
an active member of the Directory, has made war upon Toby, an obsti-
nate Allottee, upon whose fate seems to depend the fortune of the
Stags, whom we may consider as the sans-culottes of this fearful crisis.
The grand policy of the Provisional party, or the Directory, is to make
it appear that the charge of WoolMER upon the unhappy Toby is a
decisive action, by which the campaign is virtually concluded; every
possible use is therefore being made of this alleged triumph, to over-
awe the Staggery, or Railway sans-culottes, into submission.
These desperate men, who are, in fact, fighting for their liberty,
having nothing else to lose, are determined not to yield, and they reply
to the various summonses to surrender, with which they are served, b
silent contempt, or by expressions of ridicule. Others, who have acci-
dentally or imprudently got into the position of Allottees, exhibit a
firm determination not to be bullied or cajoled into the liquidation of
unjust claims, for which they are not liable.
The Provisional Committee, or, at least, their attorneys, have, like
the licentious army of the Sikhs, been revelling in all sorts of excesses,
amidst which an excessive charge for their own trouble is most conspi-
cuous. Having exhausted millions of treasure in their unprincipled
extravagance, they now seek to carry legal fire and sword, in the shape
of writ and declaration, into the camp of the Allottees, in order to
recover part of the enormous losses that have been incurred by causi-
dical wastefulness and avarice
The Allottees have more to apprehend from their own fears than from
the strength, either moral or legal, of their enemies.
The gallant Toby, who has manfully stood up against the pitiless fire
of the impetuous WoolMER, though he may seem to have afforded an
advantage to the enemy, has, in fact, only laid the groundwork of their
final discomfiture.
WoolMER may confidently expect a sad reverse before the question
at issue is finally settled, and ToBY may expect a vote of thanks from
the Stags, in commemoration of his valorous resistance.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SY MIP TO MS OF A PANIC.
“Now, Sir ; how Much do you want on this Theopolite?"
. It is all very well to talk of panics in the money-market, and pecu-
niary tightness in commercial circles; but the way in which to discover
where it is that the shoe really pinches, is by walking into the shop of
any London pawnbroker. “In such a scene,” as the Poet BuNN would
beautifully have it, “in such a scene” one may form a pretty accurate
estimate of the state of the public pocket, and whether there is, in
fact, such a panic as the city articles so learnedly talk about. We
suspect that our worst fears of a railway panic must be considered to
be realised when we saw a celebrated engineer, who was getting his
twenty guineas a day not long since, for laying out all sorts of lines
through all sorts of out-of-the-way places—when, we say, we saw such
a man as this sneaking with his dumpy level, and his now useless
theodolite, into the dark recesses of his uncle's establishment, the
cuttings must have been pretty severe, as our reduced engineer
would technically express it, when he is forced to cut off with his scien-
tific apparatus to the pawnbroker's. What a terrific gradient he
must have descended before he came down to the humiliating
point which our artist has seized upon 1
'THE MONEY MARKET.
THE Repeal Funds are still very low. They have fallen again this
week. The depression is so great, that unless something desperate is
done, and that quickly, a panic must inevitably ensue. Money never
was known to be ‘tighter' in Ireland. Defaulters increase every week.
There was a call of £1 per share on Saturday, but very few paid up.
The doings at Conciliation Hall still continue, but they are so small
that they are not worth quoting. MR. O'Connell arrives on Monday,
when a great coup de main is expected. He is a large shareholder, and
his transactions may revive the market, if they are on a very imposing
scale. Every one, however, is looking forward with dread to the set-
tling day, which cannot now be far distant.
THE IRISH CURFEW BiLL.
* As no person in Ireland is to be allowed to leave his house after a
certain hour at night, Mr. Punch respectfully asks Lord LINcolN, how
the evicted tenants are to manage, who have no houses to remain in 2
Are they to roost in the hedges An answer will oblige.
T EASTER Holidays.-SIR Robert PEEL has gone down to Drayton
Manor to enjoy himself. He has given directions that no newspaper
that contains the slightest allusion to himself is to enter the house.
THE NATION WE CANNOT SUBDUE.
We beat HYDER ALI, we conquer'd Tippoo,
We vanquish'd NApoleoN at famed Waterloo;
We defeated the Burmans, the Affghans we quell'd,
And John CHINAMAN into submission compell’d.
The Sikhs we o'erthrew, in victorious fray, on
Thy field, Aliwal, and the plain of Sobraon;
But, for all that we English endeavour or do,
“There's one obstinate nation we cannot subdue.”
All opponents beside to Britannia have knelt,
But we cannot control the refractory Celt.
Still by turbulent Ireland our power is defied—
Oh that spoke in our wheel—oh that thorn in our side :
If to tame her we've fail'd, it has certainly not
Been for want of the bayonet, or powder and shot.
May it not then be likely our course has been wrong,
In not “drawing it mild” 'stead of “coming it strong 2"
To a different plan, now, suppose we’ve recourse,
And resort to persuasion instead of to force;
And by kindness assail this invincible foe,
The reverse since we’ve tried, and have found it “no go.”
Then hurrah for the Sassenach, with Punch for their chief—
Charge potatoes and buttermilk | Charge bread and beef 1
And charge absentee landlords—a thumping good tax,
And we soon shall have “Bellum" converted to “Pax.”
And wild PAddy's shillelagh shall fall from his hand,
And contentment and quiet shall reign in the land;
And that shameful reproach shall no longer be true—
“There's one obstinate nation we cannot subdue.”

NT. to NApoleoN, the apex of the Pyramids, have seen
M a new wonder. An Italian newspaper, Lo Spetta-
tore Egizano, has been started at Grand Cairo ;
and Astonishment naturally exclaims, “What
next 2 ” to which Echo, in Hibernian accents,
answers, “Gas ;” which will probably be the next
innovation on Egyptian darkness. We wish, for
the sake of our national honour, that the first
journal established in Egypt had been an English
speculation, and this wish is father to the thought
... that if the Italian paper answers, it will not be long
without British contemporaries. We hail the
Spettatore as a sign of the times, and expect that
there will soon be a Printing House Square at Grand Cairo. It is to
be hoped, however, that in the nomenclature of these papers, or rather
papyri, their projectors will not entirely overlook the grand associations
connected with the land of CHEops. So that the Egyptian press will
boast of a Morning Isis, an Evening Osiris, and a Daily Horus. Of
course, a certain fashionable contemporary will have, literally, its own
correspondent at Grand Cairo; perhaps under the title of Morning
Obelisk, as Obelisk would be more national there than Post.
The world cannot admit of two suns, or two Punches, or we too
should anticipate a representative at Cairo. The Egyptian mind might
get up a Sphinx, and prove equal to the composition of a few riddles ;
but we suspect it ... hardly ascend to jokes. We look for much
edification from the Egyptian Court Circular ; as by the information
that His HighNEss MEHEMET ALI this morning took his customary
pipe, or honoured the performance of the dancing dervishes with his
presence.
We also augur no little diversion from Egypt's penny-a-liners, in
their paragraphs relative to the capture of crocodiles, and extraordinary
instances of sagacity in the ichneumon. At the same time, we are afraid
that the progress of Oriental journalism will rather tend to mix up the
common with the venerable. It is not a long step from Egypt to Syria
and Palestine ; and the transition from a Grand Cairo Spectator to a
Jerusalem Ecaminer will be as short. And then we shall have a Bell's
Life in Sidon, a Damascus Era, and a Jericho Sunday Times. Or who
knows that there may not be an Antioch Dispatch Nor is the fear
groundless that the monuments of ancient art will suffer through being
disfigured with placards such as these—“Read the Memphian Atlas,”
“Take in the Coptic Gentleman,” or “Thousands of pounds will be given
away to Subscribers to the Pictorial Ibis.” How the Pyramids and the
statues of MEMNoN will look with those bills pasted over them, may be
imagined by those who can conceive PsAMMEtichus in a suit of Moses,
or picture to themselves RHAMses in the ALBERT hat.

THE BRITISH ARTISTS.
PUNCH is proud of his country. He would
gladly avow his pride in the British
Artists : but if the exhibitors in Suffolk
Street have any right to the name, he
is sorry to say that his face is yet
rubicund with a blush, which com-
menced with his setting foot in the
rooms in Suffolk Street on the private
view, and has lasted ever since.
There were foreigners in the room—
men with black mustaches and trowsers-
pockets and flower-pot hats—who were
evidently taken in by the name, and
believed these painters to be the verit-
able “British Artists.” They will go
back to France, (for Frenchmen never
go to two exhibitions in a foreign coun-
try, being gifted with an instinctive
power of seeing through things at a
single glance,) and shrug their shoulders when British Art is men-
tioned, and utter a most significant “Ah ! Bah!” as they remember
the yards of spoilt canvas in Suffolk Street.
It is a humiliating sight, and that is the only epithet for it.
Punch has suffered much from the violent epidemic eruptions of
Gil Blases, and Vicars of Wakefield, and Findings of the Body of Harold,
which break out every May in the Academy Exhibition. But there
are redeeming points in that. If the artists cannot read they can
paint. If they show a marvellous lack of invention, and plentiful weak
wits, they have a command of the pencil, and a familiarity with the
resources of the palette. Their classical knowledge may be cold-drawn
from LEMPRIERE, but the dose is administered with considerable aver-
age skill. But at Suffolk Street we have all the ignorance of the
Academy—the colour and design of the al fresco exhibitions in the
New Cut and High Holborn—the conceit peculiar to “the British
Artists.” It was suggested to us that the place should be viewed as a
saleroom and not an exhibition. But how any of such pictures can be
sold, passes our comprehension. There is no saleroom, no Jew auction
mart, but there is occasionally a thing worth buying.
We write sweepingly. That there is not some good to counterbalance
the immense quantity of rubbish, it would be unfair to assert, but
what there is of it is swallowed up in the chaos of vulgarities and
absurdities. We call upon the Commissioners of Fine Arts to shut up
this gallery at once. We call upon MR. THOMAs DUNcoMBE, or MR.
HAwes, or MR. HUME, or some other member who combines patriotism
with pictorial taste, to bring in a Bill for the condign punishment of all
who shall hereafter sin as the British Artists have sinned this year.
The only destination we can see for the bulk of these pictures, is for
the Government to purchase them, and fill the National Gallery—a
fitting receptacle for such horrors. The whole of Trafalgar Square
will thus be properly and congruously furnished. The fountains and
George the Fourth would keep the Suffolk Street pictures in counte-
nance, and “the finest area in Europe” would be “spoiled” at once,
instead of being ruined inch by inch by the Commissioners.
The RAPHAELs, and the Poussins, and the REUBENses, and the
WANDYKEs, and the CoRREGGIos, and the CARRAccis, &c., might be
transferred to quarters more suited to their rank; and then the modern
ERosTRATUs (who is only kept back by the great pictures) might
arise and burn down Gallery and contents; so, winning a statue in our
future Walhalla, and the gratitude of all Englishmen of taste for all
time to come.
Again, and in conclusion, we protest against the assumption of the
name of “British Artists” by the spoilers of canvass who exhibit in
Suffolk Street. They should be confined to the initials S. B. A., with
an interpretation clause for the use of strangers, fixing the meaning to
be, “Society of Bad Artists.” This title they have won fairly. We
hope they may not have to wear it long.
Fashions from Pariss
LoRD BRough AM has gone over to Paris, for the purpose, we have
been told, of opening in person the grand congress of fashion which
takes place annually at Longchamps. We may consequently expect
amongst the next importation of modes, a Chapeau a la Lord Harry, and
who knows that his lordship, already so celebrated in trowsers, may
not bring us over the pattern of a new pair of pantaloons, called, in
compliment, after himself, Une paire de Brougham et Vaux
THE BEST ENGINEs of WAR.—Several fire-engines have been con-
structed for the Colonies. One of them will be sent over to Oregon,
for the purpose of putting JonATHAN's pipe out.
THE DUKE AND HIS LETTER WRITERS.
It is too bad. The DUKE of WELLINGTON, like Echo, is expected to
answer every donkey that may choose to bray. A couple of letters
(that have not yet gone the round of the press) have been handed to us.
The first is to the Duke ; the second the Duke's answer:—
“My Lord DUKE,-Being proud to feel that you are public property,
I wish you to inform me whether, as an allottee of the Saffron Hill and
Isle of Dogs Junction Railway, I ought to pay twelvepence a share on
fifty shares, with three-and-sixpence for the application ?
“Your obedient servant,
“ADolphus CARNs.
“P.S. When you're writing will you also decide a little wager pend-
ing in the parlour of the Flower-Pot ? Did you say, ‘Up, Guards, and
at 'em ; ” or, “Guards, up, and at 'em "'f
“FIELD-MARSHAL THE DUKE of WELLINGTON has received the letter
of MR. CARNs. He is the Commander-in-Chief, and not an attorney;
and has no connexion with railways, except when he travels by them.
“As to the expression, ‘Up, Guards, and at 'em, and “Guards, up,
and at 'em, the people of the Flower-Pot may take whichever suits
them. To the Duke either is immaterial.”

A NOTION FOR TH
E CHEAP, TAI LORS.
TAILoRs 1
I AM beginning to respect you : really I am. The scale on
which you puff is so magnificent and grand, that—I do not joke—it is
absolutely imposing. You display aspirit of enterprise truly NAPOLEoN1c.
There is a poetry in your style of business, as well as in your style of
advertising. TAYLor, the water-poet, was nothing to you tailors.
Now, let me suggest to you a means of extending yet further your
renown. Placard the town with the following notice :—
“WANTED, a number of tall handsome young men, with good figures,
and a few old ones of a venerable exterior.”
When you have got them, dress each in a first-rate suit of clothes.
Let one be attired as a gentleman of fashion, another as an officer in the
Guards, a third in a naval uniform, a fourth as a footman in livery, a
fifth as a judge, and a sixth as a bishop ; the two last being selected
from the venerable old men. Array the rest in travelling and other
costumes, and in different forms of the paletot and wrapper.
Among them let there be some ingenuous youths, elegantly clad,
suitably to their respective ages. Cause them all, bearing banners,
inscribed with “In this Style,” and charged with a general defiance to
competition, to march about the metropolis, along the kerb-stone, in
procession, with the bishop at their head. You will thus greatly extend
your notoriety at a moderate additional outlay ; but I know that you
trade for fame, and not for money. Adopt this plan, therefore, regard-
less of expense, and never mind increasing the present obstructions in
the streets.

“TO FINE YOUNG MEN.”
As it is the ARCHBishop of CANTERBURY who draws up thanks-
giving prayers for the successful slaughter of the enemy, may we ask,
is it the chaplains of regiments who write the recruiting bills, scattered
throughout the country, to catch the eye of the “Fine Young Man 2"
One of these compositions, recently put forth at Gloucester, is now
before us. There is a truthfulness in the promises held out—and
indeed a picturesqueness of painting, that do the highest credit to the
morals of the author, whether the thing be written on a drum-head or
a pulpit-cushion. For instance, when the “Fine Young Men,”—like
eels, bobbed for, are caught by the shilling, they are immediately
wºº
The allusion to sky-rockets and other fire-works shows the hand of
the master. The author subtly, knowingly touches on schoolboy
recollections—on those Fifth of November days, when fire-works were
precious to the juvenile. We subjoin a few of the advantages offered
to “the Gunners” (for so artillerymen are styled). Here they are:—
“They are lodged in the finest barracks in the world! They have light work and good
pay, the best begſ that Kent can afford, and a comfortable place in the barracks called the
“Canteen," set apart for them to see their friends in and take a cheerful glass: also a
splendid library and reading-room, a park and pleasure grounds, with a select number
of horses for their instruction and amusement. After their education is completed, they
will have an opportunity afforded them to travel to foreign countries, where they may
drink their wine at two-pence per bottle, by the New Tariffſ"
These, it must be owned, are many agreeable advantages; and yet,
with a modesty peculiar to recruiting sergeants—he of the Upper
George Inn, Gloucester, has said nothing of the box at the opera, and
the Mowbray Hounds, always at the service of the Gunners. But
perhaps the sergeants did not wish to tell the fine young men all that
was in store for them. Only let them enlist, and then no doubt he
would surprise them.
After—it is not said how many—years' service, the recruits are
promised that they shall “return to see their friends”—(balls, bullets,
and bayonets permitting)—“with money, manners, and—experience 1"
The last advantage, no doubt, warranted.
A Sure Capture.
WE recommend the following plan to Louis-PHILIPPE as an infallible
one for taking ABD-EL-KADER. Let his Majesty get the Arab chief to
accept a bill—the larger the sum the better; and put it into the hands
of LEvy. If that illustrious sheriff's officer does not capture ABD-EL-
. the very day it falls due, we will pay the amount and costs
Ourselves.
SEASONABLE RELIEF.
THE Public Baths and Washhouse establishment in Glasshouse
Yard, Smithfield, have been giving pails of whitewash for nothing to
the poor in the neighbourhood. We understand that the applications
from Railway Directors to be whitewashed have been exceedingly
numerous.

T H E S N O BS OF E N G LAN D.
BY ONE OF THEMSELVES,
CHAPTER VIII.-GREAT CITY SNOBS.
HERE is no disguising the fact
that this series of papers is
making a prodigious sensation
among all classes in this Empire.
Notes of admiration (!), of inter-
rogation (?), of remonstrance,
approval, or abuse, come pouring
into Mr. Punch's box. We have
been called to task for betraying
the secrets of three different fami-
lies of DE MogYNs ; no less than
four LADY SUsAN SCRAPERs have
been discovered; and young gen-
tlemen are quite shy of ordering
half-a-pint of port and simpering
over the Quarterly Review at the
Club, lest they should be mis-
taken for SYDNEY Scraper, Esq.
“What can be your antipathy to
Baker Street 2" asks some fair
remonstrant, evidently writing
from that quarter.—“Why only
attack the aristocratic Snobs 2"
says one estimable correspondent;
“are not the snobbish Snobs to
have their turn ?”—“Pitch into
the University Snobs!” writes
an indignant gentleman, (who
spells elegant with two 1's.)—
“Show up the Clerical Snob,”
suggests another. — “Being at
MEURICE’s Hotel, Paris, some time since,” some wag hints, “I saw
LoRD B., leaning out of the window with his boots in his hand, and
bawling out, “Garçon, cirez-moi ces bottes.' Oughtn't he to be brought in
among the Snobs "
No ; far from it. If his lordship's boots are dirty, it is because he
is Lord B., and walks. There is nothing snobbish in having only one
pair of boots, or a favourite pair; and certainly nothing snobbish in
desiring to have them clean. LoRD B., in so doing, performed a per-
fectly natural and gentlemanlike action ; for which I am so pleased
with him that I have had him designed in a favourable and elegant
attitude, and put at the head of this Chapter in the place of honour.
No, we are not personal in these candid remarks. As PHIDIAs took
the pick of a score of beauties before he completed a VENUs : so have
we to examine, perhaps, a thousand Snobs, before one is expressed upon
paper.
Great City Snobs are the next in the hierarchy, and ought to be
considered. But here is a difficulty. The great City Snob is
commonly most difficult of access. Unless you are a capitalist, you
cannot visit him in the recesses of his bank parlour in Lombard
Street. Unless you are a sprig of nobility, there is little hope of
º
º
seeing him at home. In a great City Snob firm there is generally
one partner whose name is down for charities, and who frequents Exeter
Hall; you may catch a glimpse of another (a scientific City Snob) at
my Lord N—'s soirées, or the lectures of the London Institution; of
a third, (a City Snob of taste,) at picture-auctions, at private views
of exhibitions, or at the Opera or the Philharmonic. But intimacy is
impossible, in most cases, with this grave, pompous, and awful being.
A mere gentleman may hope to sit at almost anybody's table—to
take his place at my lord duke's in the country—to dance a quadrille
at Buckingham Palace itself—(beloved LADY WILHELMINA WAGGLE-
wiGGLE | do you recollect the sensation we made at the ball of our
late adored Sovereign QUEEN CARoline, at Brandenburgh House,
Hammersmith ?) but the City Snob's doors are for the most part
closed to him ; and hence all that one knows of this great class is
mostly from hearsay.
In other countries of Europe, the Banking Snob is more expansive
and communicative than with us, and receives all the world into his
circle. For instance, everybody knows the princely hospitalities of
the SchARLAchschild family at Paris, Naples, Frankfort, &c. They
entertain all the world, even the poor, at their fêtes. PRINCE Polonia,
at Rome, and his brother, the DUKE of STRACHINo, are also remark-
able for their hospitalities. I like the spirit of the first-named noble-
man. Titles not costing much in the Roman territory, he has had
the head clerk of the banking-house made a Marquis, and his Lord-
ship will screw a bajocco out of you in exchange as dexterously as any
commoner could do. It is a comfort to be able to gratify such gran-
dees with a farthing or two, it makes the poorest man feel that he can do
good. The Polonias have intermarried with the greatest and most
ancient families of Rome, and you see their heraldic cognisance (a
mushroom or on an azure field) quartered in a hundred places in the
city, with the arms of the Colon NAs and DoRIAs.
Our City Snobs have the same mania of aristocratic marriages. I
like to see such. I am of a savage and envious nature, I like to see
those two humbugs which, dividing, as they do, the social empire of
this kingdom between them, hate each other naturally—making truce
and uniting—for the sordid interests of either. I like to see an old
aristocrat swelling with pride of race, the descendant of illustrious
Norman robbers, whose blood has been pure for centuries, and who
looks down on common Englishmen as a free-born American does on a
nigger. I like to see old STIFFNEck obliged to bow down his head
and swallow his infernal pride, and drink the cup of humiliation
poured out by PUMP and ALDGATE's butler. “PUMP and ALDGATE,”
says he, “your grandfather was a bricklayer, and his hod is still kept
in the bank. Your pedigree begins in a workhouse ; mine can be
dated from all the royal palaces of Europe. I came over with the
Conqueror: I am own cousin to CHARLEs MARTEL, ORLANDo FURioso,
PHILIP AUGUSTUs, PETER THE CRUEL, and FREDERic BARBARoss A.
I quarter the Royal arms of BRENTFoRD in my coat. I despise you,
but I want money; and I will sell you my beloved daughter, BLANCHE
StifFNEck, for a hundred thousand pounds, to pay off my mortgages.
Let your son marry her, and she shall become LADY BLANCHE PUMP
and ALDGATE.”
Old PUMP and ALDGATE clutches at the bargain. And a comfort-
able thing it is to think that birth can be bought for money. So you
learn to value it. Why should we, who don't possess it, set a higher
store on it than those who do º Perhaps the best use of that book,
the Peerage, is to look down the list, and see how many have bought
and sold birth, how poor sprigs of nobility somehow sell themselves
to rich City Snobs’ daughters, how rich City Snobs purchase noble
ladies—and so to admire the double baseness of the bargain.
Old PUMP and ALDGATE buys the article, and pays the money. The
sale of the girl's person is blest by a Bishop at St. George's, Hanover
Square, and next year you read, “At Roehampton, on Saturday, the
LADY EMILIA PUMP, of a son and heir.”
After this interesting event, some old acquaintance, who saw young
PUMP in the parlour at the bank in the City, said to him, familiarly,
“How's your wife, PUMP, my boy 2 ”
MR. PUMP looked exceedingly puzzled and disgusted, and, after a
pause, said, “Lady Blanche Pump is pretty well, I thank you.”
“O, I thought she was your trife tº said that familiar brute,
SNooks, wishing him good by ; and ten minutes after, the story was
all over the Stock Exchange, where it is told, when young PUMP
appears, to this very day.
We can imagine the weary life this poor PUMP, this martyr to
MAMMON, is compelled to undergo. Fancy the domestic enjoyments
of a man who has a wife who scorns him ; who cannot see his own
friends in his own house ; who, having deserted the middle rank of life,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
is not yet admitted to the higher; but who is resigned to rebuffs and
delay and humiliation, contented to think that his son will be more
fortunate.
It used to be the custom of some very old-fashioned clubs in the
City, when a gentleman asked for change for a guinea, always to bring
it to him in washed silver : that which had passed immediately out of
the hands of the vulgar being considered “as too coarse to soil agen-
tleman's fingers.” So, when the City Snob's money has been washed
during a generation or so ; has been washed into estates, and woods,
and castles and town-mansions; it is allowed to pass current as real
aristocratic coin. Old PUMP sweeps a shop, runs of messages, becomes
a confidential clerk and partner. PUMP THE SEcond becomes chief of
the house, spins more and more money, marries his son to an Earl's
daughter. PUMP TERTIus goes on with the bank; but his chief busi-
mess in life is to become the father of PUMP QUARTUs, who comes out
a full-blown aristocrat, and takes his seat as BARoN PUMPINgtoN, and
his race rules hereditarily over this nation of Snobs.
THE STRAND HERO.
ConsidenABLE excitement has been created in the neighbourhood of
the Strand, by the presence of an enormous gendarme within the
portico of the establishment of M. PHILIPPE the conjurer. Crowds
daily assemble round this “monster in human form,” to whom truly
British chaff is being every moment copiously administered. The gallant
fellow not understanding the language, replies with a fierce roll of the
eye, or a slight agitation of the mustache.
Much curiosity has been roused, and various conjectures have
been hazarded, as to the object of M. PHILIPPE in keeping up a great
standing army of one, at the threshold of the Strand Theatre. We
have ascertained that the measure is taken on account of the symptoms
of hostility which have shown themselves at another establishment.
While we are upon this subject, we may as well state that we have
received a communication from our own valiant Brook Green Volunteer,
requesting us to state distinctly that he is not the individual now doing
duty at the entrance of the Strand Theatre. We give the gallant
fellow's own words, as being peculiarly characteristic of the British
soldier:-"Though I would throw myself into any gap, or place myself
in the narrowest passage, in my country's cause, I could never stand at
ease in the service of the foreigner. No, I had rather bring up the van
as the driver of an advertising cart, than ground an arm or fix a
bayonet under a French officer. I had rather turn my cartridge-
box into a cigar-case, sell my gorget for a conductor's badge, and have
my bayonet converted into a skewer for a fillet of veal, than wear those
precious accoutrements as the gendarme of the alien.”
A DESCENDANT OF THE STUARTS.
MARY STUART was brought before MR. HARDwick, charged with
breaking SIR JAMEs GRAHAM's windows, and that with no more cere-
mony than SIR JAMEs broke the seals of MAzzINI's letters. MARY
Stuart's object, by this destruction, was to touch the heart of the
Home Secretary. Thinking that statesmen had their feelings framed
and glazed, she sought to appeal to them with congenial stone. In fine,
she broke two squares of glass, because SIR JAMEs would not believe
that she was “really the grand-daughter of CHARLEs STUART, but out
of her senses.” For ourselves, we think the poor woman under a delu-
sion, and this is our reason:—she said, “As to my birth, I do not think
anything of that. I only want to get my living.” Now, in our opinion,
this is by far too sensible an observation to be made by any descendant
of the STUARTs. The poor woman has no doubt been imposed upon;
the rationality of her words—the independence of her spirit—entirely
falsifies her assumed origin.
GEOGRAPHY FOR YOUNG LADIES.
ONE of the principal studies of young ladies
at Boarding-schools is Geography; but as
young ladies, generally, are not destined
to emulate MUNgo PARK, Geography, as
it is taught them, is of little use to them.
If, however, they have not to find their
way about the world, they have to find
it about town ; and a Metropolitan Geo-
graphy would be really of service to them.
We can here only afford to give an idea
of such a work, leaving it to some in-
dustrious PINNock to carry our notion
out. Geography, perhaps, would hardly
be the proper word for it; a better would
be Topography; or a better still, Shopo-
graphy. It should consist of descriptions
such as the following:—
Is bounded on the north and east by Regent
Swan AND EDGAR's.
Street, on the south by Piccadilly, and on the west by the shop next
door. It is rich in various products of the loom and spindle, and
abounds in silks, satins, balzerines, barèges, mousselines-de-laine,
gloves, ribbons, and silk-stockings.
THE PANTHEoN. On the north is bounded by Oxford-street; being
situated about 100 yards to the east of the junction of the latter with
the Street of Regent. It is bounded on the south by Great Marlborough-
street, and on the east and west by the adjacent premises. Its pro-
ductions are dolls, trinkets, Berlin wool, artificial and natural flowers,
stay-laces, cedar-pencils, card-cases, housewifes, reticules, perfumes,
and nicknackery of all descriptions; also gold-fish, parroquets, Java
sparrows, and other tropical birds. It contains some very queer speci-
mens of the fine arts, besides caricatures, and sentimental lithographs;
and there are occasionally to be met in it some nice young men.
CAPEs. Cape Cardinal is situated at most of the linendrapers'. It
may also be viewed in the Soho Bazaar; longitude about five miles
from Greenwich. This establishment lies in Soho-square, by which
it is bounded to the east; to the south by a contiguous-row of houses,
and to the west by the back settlements or slums.
We recommend the Conductresses of Seminaries for Young Ladies to
give up old GUTHRIE, and substitute for their pupils a system of geo-
graphy more likely to be useful to them in after life.
THE WINDSOR STEEPLE CHASE.
A stEEPLE chAse would be a very foolishimatter, but for the com-
pliment it very subtly conveys to the Church : an institution to
which the military in garrison at Windsor are peculiarly devoted.
During the past Passion Week the officers have raced for the “House-
hold Brigade Cup,” and a foolish parishioner of Upton-cum-Chalvey,
has, in the Times, indulged in somewhat savage remarks at the expense
of the gallant horsemen. He asks—
“Out of the 52 weeks of which the year is composed, could these gentlemen have
found no other in which to collect together the offscourings of society—to erect the stand-
ard of vice and profanity—than that in which our and their Redeemer gave up his life
in shame and agony for a fallen race? Surely this is very bad.”
Not at all. It is very proper that at such a season the play-houses
should be shut up, but wherefore prohibit the reasonable recreation
of officers and gentlemen 2 Besides, there is a moral courage mani-
fested by the military in their fine contempt of observances sacred to
mere civilians : and courage, whether in attacking a column or a cus-
tom, may be considered, by the military of Windsor garrison, the first
element of a soldier. Had they chased on Good Friday itself, 'twould
only have shown a finer spirit. The Parishioner asks :-
“Out of the seven days of the week, could no other day be found except the Sabbath,
wherein to erect their “stands' and 'booths?' Would not the Saturday before, or the
Monday after, have sufficed for the purpose? Let these gentlemen answer.”
And they do, in fact, answer and say—Sunday being observed as a
religious holiday by the vulgar, is, for that reason, the best of all days
to be devoted to sporting preparations for the select.
“The fact is, that throughout the ‘Sunday next before Easter,’ the axe, the hammer,
and the saw were unceasingly plied; and, as if that were not sufficient, a ring was formed
in the evening upon the spot, and a prize-fight concluded the labours of the day !"
Very proper. The Parishioner, however, does not inform us
whether the fight was “for love,” or for a purse contributed by the
gallant huntsmen in garrison.

the 20th of March. MR. Gibbon, says the report in the Times,
“For the last twelve years has been singularly active in causing the apprehension of
many of the most notorious and desperate thieves in the Metropolis.”
In fact, MR. GIBBox—a man of property—was an amateur policeman.
His being so was, as MR. SERJEANT AnAMs properly observed, “a
matter of taste; ” and he himself remarked, of his constabulary incli-
!. that “it was a propensity he had, and he was altogether unable
to help it.”
We have really a high respect for MR. Gibbon, and we wish that
some other men of property would follow his example. There are
numbers of our Aristocracy entirely out of employ, who might devote
themselves—gratis, of course, usefully to preservation of the peace.
Many of them, it is true, hold commissions in the Guards ! but they

THE CIVIL WAR IN THE CITY.
THIs struggle, in which “a brother madly seeks to shed a brother's
cash,” is still raging, and it has been determined that two decisive
actions shall be fought in the courts of law, the most destructive of
all fields of battle. The indefatigable Mr. Newton, the attorney, is
providing ammunition on behalf of the Watermen. That powerful
engine, a writ, has already been brought to play, and he has received
with that effective shield a special plea, the first fire—in the shape of a
declaration—from the enemy.
Writs of certiorari have been savagely exchanged, by which the
parties have shifted the champ de bataille. The City forces are confident
in the name of the LoRD MAYoR, whom they consider a tower of
strength , but it must be remembered that such a tower leans all on
one side, like the structure at Pisa. The Watermen are, on their parts,
eager, and declare themselves armed in the triple panoply of Justice.
However the struggle ends, one lamentable fact is certain—namely,
that the fields of Westminster must be deluged with the costs of both
parties.
HORSE-KILLING.
THREE horses, ridden by gentlemen, were killed—run to death—at
the Windsor Easter Hunt. We understand that the offending riders—
smitten with remorse—have sent in a very handsome subscription to
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. They have felt
that had they been costermongers, and driven their donkeys to death,
they would have been sentenced to a fine, and therefore unanimously
resolved that, being gentlemen, they should, for their offence of
cruelty, pay a double penalty.
France, the Bird of Wisdom.
M. MICHELET says, in his late work—Le Peuple, “France can see
in the darkest night, when others can no longer distinguish.” It seems,
then, that we have mistaken for the Gallic Cock what turns out to be,
in reality, an Owl.

AGRICULTURAL INTELLIGENCE.
It is a delightful thing at the present moment, when so much
excitement prevails on the subject of food, to find individuals coming
forward to suggest modes of nourishment. SIR TRAYToN DRAKE has,
we find, announced to the Royal Agricultural Society the important
fact, that he got a turnip, cut it in slices, and gave a bit to his horse,
who relished it exceedingly. SIR TRAYToN then selected a slice or
two, which he boiled in a copper, and after mashing the pieces of
turnip into a pulp, rushed off to his pig-sty and distributed the
delicacy among the inmates, who devoured it with exceeding gusto.
The country ought to feel very grateful to SIR TRAYTON DRAKE for
having made these experiments, and for having communicated the
interesting result to the Agricultural Society.
We have now got at the important fact, that pigs will eat boiled
turnips, and that a horse will not turn up his nose at the raw article.
Inspired by a strong wish to be useful to our fellow-creatures, we have
been subjecting ourselves to a series of curious experiments with
reference to food, and we hasten to lay before the public a few facts
which we have ascertained beyond all question. In the first place, we
think we can venture to assert positively that the ordinary barn-door
fowl's egg plunged into water, and boiled for a few minutes, will, when
broken, be found to contain a nutritious substance.
The common dough, when baked until a crust is formed on the exte-
rior, also furnishes a very good substitute for the less accessible muffin, or
the still more récherché tea-cake. Those who find a difficulty in purchas-
ing pastry may manage tolerably well by getting a bundle of the stalks
of the common rhubarb, stripping off the leaves, and placing them in a
dish, embedded in a paste of household flour. We have tried this, when
baked, upon our own children, who have eaten it with almost as great
a relish as was exhibited by SIR TRAYTON DRAKE's horse, when he
bolted the sliced turnip.
These things are trivial in themselves; but they are of the utmost
importance in all well-regulated families.

gentile privileges, or the rights of gentility; but as a gentleman
has been defined to be “one who keeps a gig"—and the Romans
were utterly gigless—the gentleman of Rome must have been very
different from the English notion of the character. A gentleman is
parrenus who are desirous of proving their descent
from something very high, and who certainly
prove that there has been a tremendous drop
down on their part, if they ever had illustrious
ancestors. Good genealogies may be had on reason-
said to be “one who bears a coat of arms,” and this seems to be the
definition most in accordance with the modern view ; for a coat of
arms, which means, portably, a good coat to the back, is in these days
often accepted as the distinguishing mark of a gentleman. GEORGE
THE Fourth used to be called the most finished gentleman in Europe,
entirely on the well-cut coat principle. BLACKston E says that any one
who can live idly and without manual labour, is a gentleman. Ac-
cording to this, the vagabond who clears a handsome income by
shivering with a few matches in his hand, or lying on the pavement
with a label round his neck, inscribed with the words, “I am starving,”
is a perfect gentleman. These, however, are matters that we must
leave to that Snob's alma mater, the Heralds' College.
AN “HONOURED” HEATH.

“You'RE A PRovisional DiRecroR, SIR'"
“AND You 'RE AN Allotter, SIR 1”
MOON AT THE WATERLOO BANQUET.
It is certainly not so well known as, by means of Punch, it will be
this day week, that ALDERMAN Moon, in his green gosling days, was
present at the Battle of Waterloo ! There can be no doubt of it ; for
the Alderman, as the publisher of MR. SALTER's picture of the Water-
loo Banquet, appears by portrait in the work. The beholder, after
some search, cannot fail to observe the small features of a small man
peeping in at the door of the banquet-room at the moment “when the
DUKE of WELLINGTON has just risen to return thanks for the drinking
of his health.” Those features—and the fact will show the humility
of the man—are owned, wherever he appears, by ALDERMAN Moon.
The uninformed observer, seeing that little face at the door, might
imagine that the Duke was afflicted with a tight boot ; and that, being
quite at home, he had merely acted up to the simplicity of his cha-
racter by having a moment before ordered a boot-jack; and that some-
where in the hand of the little man at the door was the instrument :
for, sooth to say, by the force of association some faces have a boot-
jack look. But this is not the case. No . ALDERMAN Moon is not
peeping into the banquetting-room under favour of a boot-jack, but by
right of service on the field of Waterloo. He was a young man then ;
but the effect of the British bayonet made a lively impression upon
him. It was from that effect the Alderman dates his passion for
steel engraving.
We are, happily, in the possession of the Military Adventures of
Alderman Moon; evidently written during sundry campaigns : as,
from a certain raggedness of the leaves, it is our belief that the MS.
was occasionally made to supply wadding for the mortal musket.
Nevertheless, we are certain that we can piece out a very handsome
military biography of the steel Alderman, allowance being made for
inevitable omissions.
We owe it to the world; we owe it to Moon himself, to publish
this life. And for this reason. We have not been nearly five years
in print; no, we have not added nearly ten volumes to the imperish-
able literature of the universe without having felt from without the
envy of the little and the malicious, of the small literary croakers,
that puff, puff, puff—swell a little, and finally burst. Therefore do
we sympathise with—therefore will we champion Moon :
For consider the consequence of destroying or keeping back the
biography in which the military claims of Moon are made as manifest,
as bright to the world, as the illuminated clock at the Horse Guards.
Would it not incite fifty people to put in their claims to be painted in
vehemently repeat the question—if the Duke's printseller, wherefore
not the Duke's tailor *
And the Duke's hatter—in a like key of indignation—puts a like
query.
And the Duke's shoemaker—we fear, with an oath, exclaims, “If
the mere printseller is admitted, why is the useful snob left out 7”
And the Duke's Gardener—who has trained and pruned and
watered the Duke's laurels since they were twigs, he, with an honest
tear in his eye, looks at Moon, or rather the half-Moon at the door,
and then indignantly dashing the “gem of sorrow" (when we write a
very fine figure, yet somehow mistrust it, we always clap it between
inverted commas ; it's safest ;)—“gem of sorrow" to the earth, asks
why he, the faithful, honest GERKIN, is not there 2
And so with all the Duke's Household:—the Duke's valet—his
coachman—his footman—his fat porter—his smallest of grooms—all
seeing Moon in the picture, will, naturally enough, clamour for
admission, unless—
—Unless they are made acquainted with the great Waterloo claims
of ALDERMAN Moon to be present—or rather to stand in the draft of
the door—at the Waterloo banquet. These claims, we pledge our-
selves to make so fully known in our next, that neither the Duke's
tailor nor the Duke's shoemaker shall have a word to say for them-
selves. Envy herself, seeing Moon in the picture, shall cease to
frown, and only suck her thumb.
We have treated this matter at some length, inasmuch as if Moon's
claims were unknown, all sorts of people in any way associated with
great men and great things might insist upon being painted to the
great perplexity of all sorts of SALTERs. For instance, when the next
royal christening should be painted, the worthy tradesman who sup-
plies the royal nursery with tops-and-bottoms, might justly expect to
be introduced not very far from the ARCHBishop of CANTERBURY.
And when the Houses of Parliament are finished, and their portraits
painted, all the original hodmen (should any survive) employed upon
the structure, might conceive that they had as good claims to be in
the pictured triumph of BARRY, as Moon has to show himself in the
painted conquest of WELLINGto.N. Now this, with Moon's enormous
military claims made known, cannot be.
In the meanwhile, we congratulate ALDERMAN Moon—we espe-
cially congratulate the subscribers to the print—that the enterprising
publisher is to all future time present at the Waterloo Banquet.
Moon is henceforth imperishably connected with WELLINGToN. He
will go down to posterity as inseparably a part of the great soldier.
Even as Oliver CRomwell's pimple upon OLIVER CRoMweLL's nose.
COMET INTELLIGENCE.
THE Telescope in Leicester Square has been reaping a good harvest
lately, owing to the rush
into the market of so many
new Comets. The astrono-
mer at the head of it is to be
heard of an evening calling
out, “Just up, a new Comet,
in capital condition. There
is likewise, Gentlemen, a tail
after the Comet, in very good
cut. A fine fresh Comet also
ready at eight o'clock, and
another will be served up,
with the milky way, at ten.
The charge is only one penny.” The customers at this Comet ordinary
are very numerous. It is not unusual to hear a gentleman say, “I’ll
take the Comet after you, sir.”
THE REAL RAILWAY KING.
A GENTLEMAN in the Queen's Bench has papered his room with
nothing but railway shares. The effect is very rich. It is calculated
that not less than three millions ofcapital has been sent in this way to
the wall. Every county in the United Kingdom is there represented.
the Waterloo Banquet as well as ALDERMAN Moon 2
For instance, the Duke's tailor speaks (or writes to the Times or
Punch):—“I helped to make the Duke's Waterloo coat. I was then
an apprentice ; but it was my glory to sew the Duke's seams. I was
present in my stitches on the field of Waterloo. And as Moon, the
printseller, is painted at the door, surely I, as the Duke's tailor, may
| be permitted to be taken with my eye at the keyhole. For, I must
The whole railway world is compressed into the space of eight feet by
six. The gentleman breakfasts in England, takes his tiffin in India,
dines at Paris, and sleeps in Switzerland, just according as he moves
his chair. We must not forget to mention that every share has been
made to run in the direction of the fire-place. In this way the flue
ingeniously represents the grand central terminus of all the lines in the
world.

NURSERY RHYW. E.
THE STORY OF THE REPEAL of THE CORN LAWS, “SUITED TO THE
MEANEST CAPACITY.”
THERE was a little Lady who had twenty-four million babies, and
she wanted to get cheap bread for them, but she could not, because of
the Corn Law. So she went to the Lords, and she said,
“Lords, Lords, repeal this law, or I cannot get cheap bread for
my babies.”
Then the Lords said to her, “Pooh We are the landed interest;
what do we care for your babies The Tories to a man will stand by
us.” So she went to the Tories, and she said,
“Tories, Tories, desert the Lords; the Lords won't repeal the law;
and I cannot get cheap bread for my babies.”
Then the Tories said to her, “Madam, we have no objection to eat |
dirt; we do it every day; but at present we are under the orders of the
Duke.” So she went to the Duke, and she said, -
“Duke, Duke, order the Tories; the Tories won't desert the
Lords; the Lords won't repeal the Law; and I cannot get
cheap bread for my babies.”
Then the Duke said to her, “F. M. the DUKE of WELLINGTON is &
Commander-in-Chief of the army, but he is neither a maltster nor a ~~
miller. All communications to his Grace must be made through SIR
Robert PEEL.” So she went to SIR Robert PEEL, and she said,
“PEEL, PEEL, speak to the Duke : the Duke won't order the
Tories; the Tories won't desert the Lords; the Lords won't
repeal the Law; and I cannot get cheap bread for my babies.”
Then PEEL said, “The Tories brought me in, I know, but I should
like to rat and cut the Snobs. However, as yet, there is no pressure -
from without, there's no Great Fact to frighten me.” So she went to
look for a Great Fact ; and she heard a voice, saying to her, “I am k -- - » - -

from St. Martin's-le-Grand to the old town, or ton, of Kensing.
We fancy the time is not far distant when extraordinary expresses
will be as much wanted, and as anxiously looked for, from the suburbs
to the Metropolis, as they have hitherto been between the banks of the
Sutlej and the bureau of the newspaper offices. We can imagine the in-
terest that will be felt in telegraphic despatches from Chelsea—the
Cockney Marseilles—or in a trial of the respective merits of the Pimlico
route, and of the passage along Brompton, the Austria of the Metropolis.

As we begin to think less of such everyday matters of news as
advices from the Court of Delhi, we shall set a higher value on the
arrival of despatches from the Court Road of Tottenham. . Such is
evidently the tendency of the existing state of the Metropolitan
thoroughfares. The inhabitants, harassed by constant blockades, are
beginning to lose sight of those ties which were the result of frequent
social intercourse, while the energy of newspaper enterprise is
rendering us familiar with India and her people.

JOKES FOR THE COURTS OF LAW.
PITYING the great destitution of
wit into which the members o
the Bar appear to be plunged,
and struck by their constant
effort to say something smart,
we have determined on pre-
paring for their use The Funny
Barrister's Manual ; or, Complete
Forensic Jester. Every one must
have remarked the very wonder-
ful economy of wit in the courts
of law, where the homoeopathic
system of humour seems to pre-
vail. The least possible amount
of smartness goes an immense
way, and the smallest contribu-
tions of fun are thankfully re-
ceived on all sides. The forensic
jokes are as old as the forensic
forms, and comprise a set of
platitudes that have appeared in
every edition of Joe Miller, from
tioners' Hall down to the present time. We therefore contemplate the
immediate prepartion of a series of jokes for humorously disposed
barristers. We shall issue an entire set of a dozen, applicable to
motions of course, which will be copyright, but a license for retailing
them may be procured on moderate terms at the Punch Office. We
shall afterwards try a serviceable lot of puns for demurrers, which
being a very dry branch of the law, is capable of much improvement
by means of a little facetious seasoning.
The Judges may receive private lessons in joking at their own
houses; or a judgment, sent down to our office overnight, will be inter-
spersed with brilliant sallies, at ten shillings per sally, and forwarded in
time for the early delivery at the morning sittings. Equity decrees
larded with the most unctuous humour, at five guineas per folio.
A few sets of questions for witnesses, for the use of common-
law barristers, and applicable to any trial on any subject, will be ready
in a few days, and specimens may be procured by application at the
Punch Office.
The present is merely an experiment, intended to prove whether wit
is utterly foreign to the forensic character. If our project succeeds,
classes for forensic joking will be established, to take the place of the
the first copy entered at sta-
singing lessons lately extinguished. Professor HoPKINs will be re-
| quested to act as an assistant, as some compensation for the loss he has
sustained by the rapid evaporation of his vocalising pupils.

some of them on a very questionable kind of ground, will be met
with amongst these Vestiges ; as will also many relics of shot and

THE SNOBS OF ENGLAND.
BY ONE OF THEMSELVEs.
CHAP. IX. —ON SOME MILITARY SNOBS.
* AS no society in the world is
| more agreeable than that
of well-bred and well-
informed military gen-
tlemen, so likewise, none
is more insufferable than
that of Military Snobs.
They are to be found of
all grades, from the
General Officer, whose
padded old breast twin-
kles over with a score of
stars, clasps, and deco.
rations, to the budding
Cornet, who is shaving
for a beard, and has just
been appointed to the
Saxe Coburg Lancers.
I have always admired
that dispensation of rank
in our country, which
sets up this last-named
little creature (who was
flogged only last week
because he could not
spell) to command great
whiskered warriors, who
have faced all dangers of climate and battle ; which, because he has
money to lodge at the agent's, will place him over the heads of men
who have a thousand times more experience and desert ; and which,
in the course of time, will bring him all the honours of his profession,
when the veteran soldier he commanded has got no other reward for
his bravery than a berth in Chelsea Hospital, and the veteran officer
he superseded has slunk into shabby retirement, and ends his disap-
pointed life on a threadbare half-pay.
When I read in the Gazette such announcements as “LIEUTE-
NANT and CAPTAIN GRIG, from the Bombardier Guards, to be Captain,
vice GRIzzle, who retires,” I know what becomes of the Peninsular
GRIzzle ; I follow him in spirit to the humble country town, where
he takes up his quarters, and occupies himself with the most desperate
attempts to live like a gentleman, on the stipend of half a tailor's
foreman ; and I picture to myself little GRIG rising from rank to rank,
skipping from one regiment to another, with an increased grade in
each, avoiding disagreeable foreign service, and ranking as a Colonel at
thirty ;-all because he has money, and LoRD GRIgsby is his father,
who had the same luck before him. GRIG must blush at first to give
his orders to old men in every way his betters. And as it is very dif-
ficult for a spoiled child to escape being selfish and arrogant, so it is a
very hard task indeed for this spoiled child of Fortune not to be a Snob.
It must have often been a matter of wonder to the candid reader,
that the Army, the most enormous Job of all our political institu-
tions, should yet work so well in the field ; and we must cheerfully
give GRIG, and his like, the credit for courage which they display
whenever occasion calls for it. The DUKE's dandy regiments fought
as well as any (they said better than any, but that is absurd). The
great Duke himself was a dandy once, and jobbed on, as MARL-
Borough did before him. But this only proves that dandies are brave
as well as other Britons—as all Britons. Let us concede that the
high-born GRIg rode into the entrenchments at Sobraon as gallantly as
CoRPoRAL WALLOP, the ex-ploughboy.
The times of war are more favourable to him than the periods of
peace. Think of GRIG's life in the Bombardier Guards, or the Jack-boot
Guards ; his marches from Windsor to London, from London to
Windsor, from Knightsbridge to Regent's Park; the idiotic services
he has to perform, which consist in inspecting the pipeclay of his
company, or the horses in the stable, or bellowing out “Shoulder
humps!Carry humps!” all which duties the very smallest intellect that
ever belonged to mortal man suffice to comprehend. The professional
duties of a footman are quite as difficult and various. The red-jackets
who hold gentlemen's horses in St. James's Street could do the work
little Lieutenants, who may be seen sauntering about Pall Mall, in high-
heeled little boots, or rallying round the standard of their regiment in
the Palace Court, at eleven o'clock, when the band plays. Did the
beloved reader ever see one of the young fellows staggering under
the flag, or, above all, going through the operation of saluting it 2
It is worth a walk to the Palace to witness that magnificent piece of
tom-foolery.
I have had the honour of meeting once or twice an old gentleman,
whom I look upon to be a specimen of army-training, and who has
served in crack regiments, or commanded them, all his life. I allude
to Lieutenant-GENERAL THE Honour ABLE Sir George GRANBy
TUFto., K.C.B., K.T.S., K.H., K.S.W., &c., &c. His manners are irre-
proachable generally; in society he is a perfect gentleman, and a most
thorough Snob. |
A man can't help being a fool, be he ever so old, and SIR George is
a greater ass at sixty-eight than he was when he first entered the army
at fifteen. He distinguished himself everywhere : his name is men-
tioned with praise in a score of Gazettes : he is the man, in fact,
whose padded breast, twinkling over with innumerable decorations,
has already been introduced to the reader. It is difficult to say what
virtues this prosperous gentleman possesses. He never read a book in
his life, and, with his purple, old gouty fingers, still writes a school-boy
hand. He has reached old age and grey hairs without being the least
venerable. He dresses like an outrageously young man to the present
moment, and laces and pads his bloated old carcass as if he were
still handsome GeoRGE TUFto of 1800. He is selfish, brutal, passion-
ate, and a glutton. It is curious to mark him at table, and see him
heaving in his waistband, his little bloodshot eyes gloating over his
meal. He swears considerably in his talk, and tells filthy garrison
stories after dinner. On account of his rank and his services,
people pay the bestarred and betitled old brute a sort of reve-
rence ; and he looks down upon you and me, and exhibits his con-
tempt for us, with a stupid and artless candour, which is quite
amusing to watch. Perhaps, had he been bred to another profession, he
would not have been the disreputable old creature he now is. But
what other ? He was fit for none; too incorrigibly idle and dull
for any trade but this, in which he has distinguished himself publicly
as a good and gallant officer, and privately for riding races, drinking
port, fighting duels, and seducing women. He believes himself to be
one of the most honourable and deserving beings in this world. About
Waterloo Place, of afternoons, you may see him tottering in his
warnished boots, and leering under the bonnets of the women who pass
by. When he dies of apoplexy, the Times will have a quarter of a
column about his services and battles—four lines of print will be wanted
to describe his titles and orders alone—and the earth will cover one
of the wickedest and dullest old wretches that ever strutted over it.
Lest it should be imagined that I am of so obstinate a misanthropic
nature as to be satisfied with nothing, I beg (for the comfort of the
forces) to state my belief that the Army is not composed of such
persons as the above. He has only been selected for the study of
civilians and the military, as a specimen of a prosperous and bloated
army Snob. No : when epaulets are not sold ; when corporal punish-
ments are abolished, and CoRPoRAL SMITH has a chance to have his
gallantry rewarded as well as that of LIEUTENANT GRIG ; when there
is no such rank as Ensign and Lieutenant, (the existence of which
rank is an absurd anomaly, and an insult upon all the rest of the army),
and should there be no war, I should not be disinclined to be a Major-
General myself.
I have a little sheaf of Army-Snobs in my portfolio, but shall pause
in my attack upon the forces until next week.
t
just as well as those vacuous, good-natured, gentlemanlike, rickety
Official Intelligence.
WE understand it is in contemplation to add to the number of clerks
at present employed in the Register Office in Chancery Lane, on
account of the number of persons who are continually applying to re-
gister their paletots. If the struggle goes on among the cheap tailors,
who are continually trying to outvie each other in novelty, the Battle
of the Paletot, like the Battle of the Constitution, will have to be fought
in the Registration Courts.
THE REAL SUFFERERS.
AN author has been paying a large sum of money to have his tragedy
played. This arrangement, we think, is hardly, fair—it is not the
manager in such cases, but the audience who should be paid.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE GOLDEN BEAR.
We take the subjoined from The Daily News:-
“BARon STIEglitz, the rich Petersburgh merchant, who inherited his father's vast
property at his decease some three or four years since, was on 'Change yesterday, and
was the “observed of all observers:” his reputation of being worth five millions British,
sterling, obviously secured to him the homage of all the frequenters of a place where
wealth gives rank.”
“Where wealth gives rank 1" We should like to know the spot in
blessed England where wealth does not give rank. Try BARoN
STIEGLITz in every city, town and hamlet throughout the country,
beginning at the Land's End and finishing in London; let it be duly
known that a man, a monster man, “with five millions British, ster-
ling,” was about to produce himself, and the whole populace would
turn out to look at him ; the wiser sort taking care to guard their
eyes with spectacles, lest the five millions of glittering gold should
somehow concentrate their glories in the Baron's countenance, and
scorch them like sunbeams. We are sure of it. The Baron might
add a tolerable amount to the five millions if he would show himself
at a guinea a-head to begin with. We can imagine hundreds of City
men paying down their cash to have a good stare at the marvel they
themselves have some fond hopes to emulate. The price might gra-
dually descend to meet the means of all classes, until it fell to a penny.
As it is thought something even to cut beef “with a hammy knife,”—
so even for poverty to look at a man worth five millions might give to
poverty a certain conceit of wealth—just a flavour of gold.
How is it that BARoS STIEglitz has not yet been especially ban-
quetted at Guildhall ? How is it that the freedom of the City in a
box of diamonds (because he has five millions sterling) has not been
presented to him 2 If wealth is not to have its customary respect—
if the “refined gold” of the golden calf is not to be again gilt and gilt,
alas ! for the privileges of property. But our hopes are in SIR PETER
LAURIE. Doubtless, at the next Court of Aldermen he will propose
the proper honours to BARON STIEGLITz.

A LITTLE while ago we had a regular glut of comets, which came
hurrying into the astronomical market with so much rapidity that it
was feared they would scarcely find room in that part of the skies re-
maining open at all hours of the night for their accommodation. The
| glut of comets has been succeeded by a glut of Wizards, who have come
pouring in upon us with considerable energy during the late Easter
Holidays. Philippe, the soi-disant physician, has had a rival in the
arrival of ANDERSON, the old original Northern Wizard, who was the
first of the present race of metropolitan Magi that started a series of
Delphic mysteries at the Adelphi.
Both conjurers, however, are thrown into the shade by the appear-

articles from the inside of an orange; but what shall we say of the
Political Magician, who draws Free Trade and a variety of other objects
out of nothing in the world but a diseased potato ? His collection of
automata is perhaps the most complete that was ever known. Instead
of having, like MR. ANDERson, one little figure nodding or shaking its

hands to be surpassingly ingenious, and every one is quite aware that
his effects are all produced by mere tricks ; the delusion is so complete
that universal admiration is excited at the ease with which he succeeds
in duping every one, including even those whose eyes are wide open.

in the form of substantial blocks, may be intended as a substitute for
the wood pavement. There is no doubt that, the ice would be an
improvement on the wood; for the latter has all the slippery qualities
of the former, without any of its more desirable attributes.
Another very feasible suggestion with reference to the destination of
the Wenham Ice, is, that its importation may have something to do
with DR. REID's Ventilating experiments. The professor may possibly
require a few cargoes of ice to enable him to cool down the atmosphere
to the degree required for Parliamentary consumption.
Another opinion seems to be, that the ice is intended for workhouse
use, as it has been ascertained by DR. REID that persons in a freezing
temperature feel a total prostration of the appetite. At all events, it
is a mystery to us; for all this ice seems quite incapable of solution.

PUNCH TO HIS MANUFACTURING FRIENDS.
OUR friends in the North are earnestly entreated to pause in their munificence.
We are literally overstocked with articles of utility, and are groaning undera per-
fect plethora of pots and pans, kettles and crockery. We sincerely regret our
rashness in having adopted the principle resorted to for furnishing the PECKsxIF-
FERY; for our attic being small, we are not able to accommodate half the dust-pans,
jugs, and basins that the beneficence of our friends in the North has showered
down upon us. We are compelled to put up with the company of a great wooden-
headed Scotchman in the act of constantly taking a pinch of snuff, which has been
sent to us as a specimen of the perfection attained in making figures for the shop-
doors of the tobacconists. A washing-tub is well enough in its place, but we rather
object to give it accommodation in
our study, and we beg leave to inform
the person who gave it us, that unless
it is carried away, it will be sold to
pay expenses, for it has cost us a
world of worry to know where to
put it. The pickles we have received

to accommodate our friends as far

more ironmongery or turnery, under
any pretext whatever. We are like

And what was his reply
Why, a piping-hot sirocco blast
He puff"d into my eye.

While these two “humbugs” tilt 2

And only gave a wall;
In short, though he's a man of bricks, |
He's not a brick at all.
So take your time, &c.
“No money, no completion ”—
The song now sung to you—
Your sons will hear from year to year,
And your great grandsons too.
So take your time, &c.

The House will see, I know,

New REIDs affect to blow.

As sure as I'm old HARRY,
And you my victims are,
I'll move that REID and BARRY
Be call'd to your Lordships' bar.
So take your time, &c.
And when we know who's guilty,
It then shall be agreed—
That REID shall blow up BARRY,
Or BARRY brick up REID.
So take your time, do BARRY,
But BARRY, BARRY, don't be long ;
If you take much longer, BARRY,

BROUGHAM AND THE TALLow-CHANDLER.
SoME of our readers may recollect the story of the tallow-
chandler, who, when he disposed of his good-will, and was
about to retire upon a fortune, made an especial agreement
that he should be allowed to come to the shop, and enjoy
himself on melting-days. We wonder that this story was
forgotten by BRough AM—so full as he is of anecdote-
when he was called up to the Lords. He ought certainly to
have had a clause inserted in his patent, that would have
relieved him in his present strait, for he complained, a
night or two since, that “there seemed an utter incapacity
to do business in another place. Their Lordships did their
business; but elsewhere they seemed never to think of it.”
Assuredly, like the old tallow-chandler, BRough AM ought
to be permitted to take his seat in the Commons on melt-
ing-days.

MISSISSIPPI LEGISLATION.
In the City Article of the Times of the 17th April is the Report of a
the abolition of all laws for the recovery of debt. It is not against
obtaining performance of a contract. The Report terminates with the
recommendation of a Bill.
A copy of this Bill has been forwarded to us exclusively, and we have
great pleasure in laying it before our readers.
A BILL FOR THE TOTAL ABOLITION OF ALL MEANS OF RECOVERING
DeBTs IN THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI.
&RHijercag the practice of applying for, and recovering debts, is |
found detrimental to that spirit of friendship and good fellowship that
should prevail among the citizens of a free and enlightened state : And
whereas, in cases of debt generally, the lender is the primary cause of
the debt being contracted, and should not therefore be allowed to take
advantage of his own wrong : BE IT ENACTED, That from and after
the 30th day of June next, no person in this State to whom a sum of
money is owing, shall make any attempt to recover it from the party
from whom it is due, either by legal process, application, plain request,
delicate allusion, gentle hint, or otherwise; nor shall he in the presence
of the said indebted party ever make any mention of the said sum due,
either directly or indirectly, under penalty of forfeiting his rights as a
citizen of this State.
IL AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That if at any time after the
said 30th of June any party shall, contrary to the provisions of this
Act, make any mention of a debt due to him in the presence of the
party indebted, and such last-mentioned party shall resent the same by
a prompt application of the bowie-knife, the said party last-mentioned
shall be deemed to have committed no offence whatever against the
laws of this State.
III. AND where.As, sundry schoolmasters in this State have been
in the habit of instructing the children committed to their charge to
write on divers slates and copy-books such pernicious maxims as
“Honesty is the best policy,”—“Out of debt out of danger,” and the
Allottees and two Provisionals.”
said 30th of June shall be convicted of having taught any child or adult
these or similar maxims, or any other maxims tending to show the
justice or expediency of paying debts, shall be deemed to come within
the application of the law of John LYNch, of blessed memory.
IV. AND BE IT ENACTED, That this Act shall not be repealed by
any Act to be passed in this or any future session of the Legislature.
HER MAJESTY'S (LEGAL) STAG HOUNDS.
THE celebrated Stag, WALKER, was last term uncarted at Nisi Prius :
where he afforded a good run of several hours' duration. After he had
been allowed the usual delay, significantly termed, in sporting phrase:
ology, law, the hounds were fairly set on his track; when he started
gallantly across country in the direction of several projected lines of
railway, displaying his usual ingenuity in baffling and doubling on his
foes. After leading them a brisk gallop over several wide fields of
legislation, in the course of which more than one eager sportsman was
deposited in the mud, the dogs came up with him at a corner of the
Joint-Stock Company's ground, where everybody expected he would
have been taken; but turning off at a very acute angle, the wily animal
suddenly took to the Court of Exchequer; thus successfully eluding
his pursuers. In this asylum he has thus, for the present, realised
Edwin LANDsh;ER's picture of the “Sanctuary,” not having as yet been
captured ; and his ultimate seizure is extremely doubtful.
French Polish.
JULEs JANIN has published a translation of Clarissa Harlowe, with a
long preface, in which he talks about having improved Rich ARDsoN.
The next literary attempt of this generous critic will be, we are told, to
rub up Milton, polish Scott, give BYRoN a lift, and throw a little light
upon SHARspeARE.

W.A.N.T ED, A LAU N D R ESS.
It is a matter of much surprise in the City, that the Gresham Com-
mittee should allow the statue of HER MAJESTY in the Royal Exchange
to remain so long without washing. We believe that the citizens are
tolerably well off for soap, and there can therefore be no excuse for
allowing the QUEEN to stand in such a public situation with a face
“regularly grimed in,” as the nursery maids used to say in the days of
our infancy. All the nice shading of the features, designed by the
artist, is destroyed by dabs of soot, and smoke, that have got settled
in all the lines of the royal countenance. The crown is also in a truly
disgraceful state, and has never had so many stains upon it within the
period of our memory.
The hair of HER MAJESTY is smothered in dust, while the royal
fingers are so fearfully besmeared, that we are quite sure if HER
MAJESTY only knew of the fact, she would wash her hands of the
business altogether. The royal robes look as if they had been worn
until the dirt had got so completely ground in, that there would be no
getting it out again. We strongly advise the engagement of a laundress
to do the washing regularly, for HER MAJESTY's representative.
Royalty surely deserves a clean face, once a week at least; and if HER
MAJEsty stands on too high an eminence to be reached every day, she
is at all events approachable through the medium of a Turkish
ambassador, or a Turk's-head, as that great enemy of cleanliness is
technically designated. We should be sorry to harbour a disrespect-
ful feeling towards the QUEEN, but we must confess that we never enter
the Royal Exchange without wishing we had a pail of water at
hand to throw unceremoniously into the face of our Sovereign. Though
HER MAJESTY might take offence, she would not look half so black at
us when the operation was over.
“HIGH ART" versus TOM THUMB.
B. R. HAYDoN, historical painter, has made a bold, not to say an
unfeeling attack on GENERAL TOM THUMB. He has, moreover, shown
a great want of respect towards very distinguished persons. However,
let MR. HAYDoN speak for himself. He thus shouts to HoRACE’
VERNET, LA Roche, and others, through the columns of the Times:–
“Erquisite. Feeling of the English People for High Art.—GENERAL Tom Thumb

We have a great respect for the burning enthusiasm of MR.
HAYDoN ; but, like all enthusiasts, he lamentably lacks judgment—
discretion. In the first place, the 12,000, people who visited ToM
Thumb did not visit the mere dwarf. No. it was not unmixed

makes in the way of human creatures, very dull jokes at times)—no, it
was to pay a reverence to one whom royalty delights to honour. Tom

template it.

A LARGE room, capitally adapted for an exhibition, with benches on
each side for an audience of 500, can be let for several nights in the
week, it being generally disengaged on the Mondays, Wednesdays, and
Saturdays. Tricks, transformations, zoological concerts, and dissolving
views could beshown off to the greatest advantage, the room having been
previously used for those purposes. There is likewise a table which
would be just the thing for ToM THUMB. Terms very moderate, as
the object of the parties is to prevent the rºom from falling into ruin,
from its being so seldom used. For further particulars, apply to the
Speaker at the House of Commons, any Thursday night, not later
than ten. Cards to view the premises may be obtained from any

HOLY (FRENCH) BAYONETS.
M. Michelet has written an admirable book
against the Jesuits. His Priests, Women,
and Families, is truly an excellent work,
stampt with the highest social value. It
would seem that M. MichELET regretted
the authorship of so much excellence,
and straightway resolved to balance the
good book—to overbalance it we should
say—with a very stupid, and a very
wicked one. He therefore wrote his last
work, The People. In this book, or blas-
phemy, MichELET, places the hopes of
human nature in a powder-magazine.
His remedies for all social ills are in bul-
lets ; his light that is to lead the nations
on to regeneration, the flashing rays of
swords and bayonets. A jubilee is to be
preached to the whole earth, but it is to
be preached by roaring cannon. The
whole world is to be blest with fertility,
as in the Golden Age ; but then it must
first be watered with torrents of blood,
and fertilised with thousands of carcases. The next generation, after
breathing an atmosphere of smoke and brimstone, will see the bright
blue of a better day. And, be it understood, France is to do all this.
France is the arsenal where the weapons that are to convert the
human race—weapons of divine temper—are piled. It is French
lead, French gunpowder, and French steel, that are to bring about the
pure!
young soldiers :
millennium.
It is thus the philosopher brays to Young France : it is
thus he would teach the tiger-cubs to lap blood :—
“Ah! my only hope is in the flag 1–that it may save France, and the France of the
army. May our glorious army, upon which the eyes of the world are fixed, keep itself
May it be a sword against the enemy, proof against corruption?”
No hope in the peaceful heart of man—no hope in the fraternising
spirit of science and commerce : no, MichELET's only hope “is in the
flag;” the flag that has in its day been to a nation, what a death's-
head and cross-bones have been to some twenty miscreants who have
pillaged and murdered every luckless victim in their power. Never-
theless, the philosopher prays that the glorious army “may keep
itself pure " Well, recollecting the caves of Dahra, if the army be
pure now, it is safe for all time ; for we cannot well understand what
atrocity—what blackness is to defile it.
“May a spirit of police never enter there : What a deposit in the hands of these
What responsibility for the future! On the day of the last grand battle
between civilisation and barbarism (who knows but it may be to-morrow 2) the judge
must find them irreproachable, their swords pure, and their bayonets gleaming without
spot. Every time I see them pass, my heart bounds within me. Here, and here only,
strength and mind, valour and right, things separated throughout the earth, go hand in
hand. If the world is saved by war, you will save it. Holy bayonets of France!
watch that nothing may darken that glory now hovering above you, and which no eye can
sustain.”
“Between civilisation and barbarism ' " Between civilised France
and barbarian England—eh, M. MichELET 2 Is John BULL to be
taught the humanities by the “bayonets without spot ?” Are his
preceptors to be those nice, irreproachable youths, tipped and mous-

and right” go hand in hand, how will the nations of the earth

all men moral dignity and perfect civilisation,-only there is this slight

PUNCH'S POLITICAL DICTIONARY.
GLEANING. The practice of picking up what is left behind by the
reapers. Gleaning may, according to circumstances, be respectable or
otherwise. If I leave my pocket-handkerchief hanging out behind,
the person who acts as a gleaner, and carries it away, is no better than
a pickpocket. So, if I get into a cab and leave behind me a pocket-
book, the driver is not authorised in turning gleaner, and clearing off
my property, because I accidentally leave it behind me. There are
also gleaners of another class, who enter the field of literature, and,
with a view of making their bread, pick up all the stray ideas left
behind by the original reapers, who may perhaps have had the trouble
of cultivating the crop, for the refuse of which the literary gleaner
crawls about with humble industry. By some rules made at a meeting ||
of farmers, in August, 1845, it was agreed that the privilege of
gleaning should not be allowed to any able-bodied labourer. The same
rule is, we presume, applicable to literary gleaners, as no able labourer
in the field of letters would stoop to such a practice.
GoverNMENT. A word used in several senses, which accounts for
the ambiguity that often belongs to ministers. It means the business
of Government, or thing done, or the persons who do, though the
thing done is not usually the Government, but the nation. There are
several forms of Government, of which Monarchy, Aristocracy, and
Democracy are the principal. To use a musical illustration, Monarchy
may be compared to a solo, where one man executes all sorts of airs.
Aristocracy is a concerted piece ; while Democracy is generally
nothing better than a discord. Our English Government is a combi-
nation of all three, producing generally a very delightful harmony.
When some low notes get out of tune in the bass, or when too much
falsetto is introduced in the higher parts, the effect is often dis-
agreeable.
THE LAND OF BULLS.
“At an Inquest held at Clonmel, on Friday last, on the body of a man found dead in
the street, the jury returned a verdict of “Death from starvation.’”
“At the Dublin Cattle Show, the prize cattle were declared to be fatter than had ever
been seen before. PRINck Albert's heifer is expected to win the first prize.”
To find out the cause of “Ould Ireland's" distress,
The nobs of the nation are puzzling their wigs;
But the Cattle-show leads us to hazard this guess,
—The peasants are starving to fatten the pigs.
While a landlord has prizes at Dublin to win.
What matter potatoes and rubbish like that ?
Poor people, of course, must expect to get thin,
When the farmer's obliged to make cattle so fat.
This explains the strange stories recorded with stress,
In the Times, and indeed all the papers you touch ;
While men die of hunger induced by distress,
The pigs and the calves die of eating too much
SIBT HOR PIE ON ELIECTION S.
THE gallant Militia Colonel has made one of his great speeches
(most imperfectly reported) in the Commons, on the Duration of
Elections Bill. He said, “I have a vote for five counties, and as I am
not a bird—(cries of ‘yes, you are )—I shall not condescend to answer
such ribaldry, for I very well know the sort of bird that hom. members
mean. As I am not a bird, to be in five places at once, how can I eat
the five dinners to be given on the triumph of Conservative principles’
If anything more than another can show the revolution to which we
are fast arriving, it is the shabbiness that has crept into election
expenses. I like to see money fly like winking. (Great laughter.) Hon.
members may laugh ; but they know very well what I mean by
winking. All the true manly spirit—the pride of our ancestors—as
shown at elections, is vanished—effervesced—obliterated. There was
a time when the independent English yeoman expressed his political
opinions by means of dead cats, cabbage-stumps, and bad eggs, but the
Whigs, with their confounded Reform, have broken the heart, yes, the
lion-heart—of BRITANNIA, and—and" [Here the hon. and
(militia) gallant member sat down in a state of great excitement,
promising that his speech should be continued at their “next."]

3Ebutation ºn 33lectric Celegrapí).
T has been announced that a Submarine Electric
Telegraph is to be laid down from Dover to
Calais. If this great feat is accomplished, we
shall have, in addition to electrical eels, a quan-
tity of galvanic soles, and perhaps an immense
assortment of shocking herrings. We shall
have salmon amusing themselves by going
through a series of wonderful evolutions on the
slack wire, and other facetious members of the
finny tribe, hurrying to and fro upon the
great medium of communication between
France and England. It would be awkward
if some mischievous old shark should snap
the wire in two, just as it might be in the act
of conveying some very important piece of
intelligence. He might cut short a royal
speech with a slight effort of his jaw; or, with
a wag of his tail, abbreviate the most interest-
ing announcement. Our object, however, in
alluding to the Submarine Electric Telegraph,
is for the purpose of recommending that it
should be devoted to educational purposes.
We are aware that professors already advertise
their readiness to teach “French, compara-
tively in no time;” but this language may
be acquired in that wonderfully brief space
of time distinguished as “the twinkling of a
bed-post” by the wonderful aid of the Electric
Telegraph.
Supposing branch wires to be connected
with the main line, they could be laid on to
all the schools in England, particularly about
the Kentish coast, where the experiment might
be tried in the first instance. A French
master stationed at the Calais end of the wire,
could direct his lessons along the line, and
the wires laid on to the various schools would
communicate to them all the instruction that the French master might
be capable of affording. The same system could, of course, be equally
well adapted to other studies.
SERIOUS ACCIDENT TO A MEDICAL GENTLEMAN.
“MR. PUNCH,
“I am a physician, and I sign myself as below, because the
appearance of my name in connection with any publication of wit or
humour, would be fatal to me in my profession. I reside near Belgrave
Square, and I was sent for the other day to see an old patient in the
neighbourhood of the Mansion House, instantly. I directly ordered my
carriage, and proceeded as quickly as possible to my destination; but
owing to the obstructions in Fleet Street and Ludgate Hill I was one
hour and twenty minutes before I got there. Judge of my feelings,
Sir, when I tell you that on entering the sick chamber I found a neigh-
bouring practitioner bleeding my patient in the jugular vein and
especially when I add, that the man has supplanted me in the family.
Let me conclude, Sir, by indignantly apprising you of the circumstance
that an omnibus-pole smashed my vehicle into the bargain.

WHO IS THE GOVERNMENT BROKER 2
WE every now and then hear of the Government Broker,
who, we are told, goes into the market and operates. Our idea of a
broker is a man who comes and seizes one's goods for rent, or who
keeps a sort of stall for old furniture, and lives in a place called Bro-
kers' Alley, in the uninviting neighbourhood of Holborn. What the
Government can possibly want with a broker, we are totally at a loss
to conceive. We sometimes think it may be a man kept by the Govern-
ment for the purpose of being put into possession when it is found ne-
çessary to distrain for assessed taxes. At other times we imagine the
Government Broker is the person who supplies the desks, chairs, &c.,
&c., for the public offices. His operations in the market are, however,
beyond us altogether, and we give up the fruitless attempt to unravel
the mystery.
BARON PARKE ON SERMONS.
“MR. PUNCH,
“I HAVE read, in the case of ‘GATHERcole v. MIALL, that
MR. BARON PARKE states that “there was a wide distinction between
the act of a clergyman's preaching a sermon, and the fact of an indi-
vidual publishing a book. In the latter case, it was quite clear that the
publisher of a book invited criticism.’
“Now, Mr. Punch, it appears from this that the whole question is a
matter of printing. Now, I wish to ask you, if, as an actor, I am not
perfect in my part—(an event, by the way, that never happens)—and
I play the said part from a play not printed, whether I could not
recover against yourself for any reasonable abuse, seeing that as the
play was in MS., I did not ‘invite criticism 2'

A LADIES’ CLUB.
It is announced, we perceive, that a Ladies' Club is to be opened
in the ensuing May. We are glad to see that the Ladies of England
have spirit enough to take up the Club in their own defence,
and hope they will return, with compound interest, the heavy blow and
the great discouragement which Clubs have so long inflicted on them.
Your married gentleman of fashion will now know what it is to have a
partner come home the worse for tea, and perhaps none the better for
scandal. We shall willingly contribute any suggestions for arrange-
ments that may occur to us as suitable to this institution. For the
accommodation of mammas, a children's room should be attached to it;
and in addition to the chicken, lobster-salad, and pastry, constituting
the ordinary bill of fare, a sufficiency of rusks, soojie, and “tops-and-
bottoms,” should be kept constantly on hand. It would be well, also,
that a proper quantity of feathers, to burn in case of necessity, as well as
an adequate number of bottles of Leamington salts, should be accessible
on the premises. A cab, as an adjunct to a Club, will become requisite
to the young lady of fashion; and we may hence expect the develop-
ment of a new animal creation, in the shape of a tigress. The Ladies'
Club, of course, will take in all the more elegant periodicals; we need
hardly say, especially Punch. As necessarily will it contain a collection of
music, which should include the following new version of a certain
popular catch: — “We won't go home till evening—till candles do
appear.” In short, it should be invested with every inducement to
ladies to stay out as late as possible, and enjoy themselves away from
the solitary drawing-rooms.
EDUCATION FOR SOLDIERS.
UR contemporary the Quarterly Re-
view has suggested, very properly,
that English soldiers should be edu-
cated as they are in most parts of the
Continent. We think the scheme a
very excellent one ; but it ought
to be extended to the officers, who
are often, comparatively, quite as
destitute as the men of educational
advantages.
Entering the army at fifteen or
sixteen, it is hardly to be supposed
that they can have completed an
education at an age when persons
in other professions are only begin-
ning it. We beg leave, therefore,
to recommend, for the benefit of our
brave soldiery, the immediate esta-
blishment of evening schools for
military adults. It is all very well
to talk about “teaching the young
idea how to shoot ; ” but, unless
the “young idea" in the army can
do something beyond mere shoot-
ing, he will not be qualified to
shine in society.
We are quite sure that the officers of the various regiments will at
once acknowledge the advantages of a course of instruction that shall
combine Latin exercises with the platoon exercise, and enable them to

AFFAIR OF REAL HONOUR.
HE Field of the Cloth of Gold, we believe,
was no field of any such metal, but only of
silver, because, like silver, it has been entirely
superseded. That field, whereon HENRY VIII.
and, FRANCIs I. shook hands, - must yield
henceforth in celebrity to the Field of the
Cloth of Table, over which M. THIERs and
LoRD PALMERSTON have made it up. The
former, if fields were liable to eclipses, we
should say is now eclipsed; but at any rate
fields are capable of sinking, and we pro-
nounce it to have sunk into comparative
insignificance. Indeed, we prefer the Field
of the Table Cloth to that of the Gold Cloth in
-- every way. First, of the two it was much the
least expensive ; although we do not know what it cost M. THIERs, and
are at the same time confident that he did the handsomething. Secondly,
its arrangements were much the more agreeable, and far the better
calculated to promote the end in view ; breaking a lance being consi-
derably less conducive to harmony and good feeling than cracking a
bottle. : A friendly sparring-match, knightly or fistic, may be a good-
humoured termination of a quarrel; but an amicable eating-match is
a much better one ; and the blows in which a difference ends most
satisfactorily are blows-out.
History, in the person of DR. GoLDSMITH, informs us that HENRY,
for the honour of his country, had, at the Field of the Cloth of Gold, a
tilting-bout with MEssIEURs GRANDEvaL and DE MonTMORENCY, the
former of whom he placed hors de combat. Whether LoRD PALMERSTON,
from the same motive, engaged in a bout of another description, and
saw Messieurs Anybody under the table at the field of the cloth thereof,
we are not at present informed. We may, however, confidently state,
that it was M. THIERs who, at this sociable set-to, had the honour of
drawing the first claret; and we hope it proved good. We wish we
had been present at this tourney of the Table Cloth, to have displayed
our devotion to our ladye-love by an exploit the most congenial to
knights of our order.
AN
In the mean time, we congratulate both France and England upon
the whole affair. The best way of putting an end to animosity is
treating it like the DURE of CLARENCE ; and we are glad that M.THIERs
and LoRD PALMERSTON have drowned theirs in the bowl.
DRURY LANE THEATRICAL FUND.
THIs Society has its Dinner on Monday, when the pockets of the
people present will be eloquently appealed to by MR. HARLEY, the
Master of the Fund. We are not at liberty to give the document; but,
following the custom of our contemporaries, as regards QUEEN's Parlia-
mentary speeches, we may venture to indicate the heads. MR. HARLEY
will begin by giving a short history of the Fund. Possibly he will
name the number of claimants, and state the amount of balance in
hand. He will then appeal to the company upon their old dramatic
recollections. He will show what peculiar claims the company of Drury
Lane, as at present established, have upon public charity. He will give

Good News for Politicians,
At a recent conversazione of the MARQUIs of NorthAMPTON, there
were exhibited some examples of a process by which all organic sub-
stances can be brought to a consistency approaching petrifaction, so as |
to be preserved to an indefinite period. In the present dearth of poli-
tical consistency, the discovery bids fair to become of very great value
to Statesmen.

T H E S N O BS OF E N G LAN D.
BY ONE OF THEMSELVES,
CHAPTER X.-MILITARY SNOBS.
ALKING in the Park yesterday with my
young friend TAGG, and discoursing with
him upon the next number of the Snob,
at the very nick of time who should pass
us but two very good specimens of
Military Snobs,-the Sporting Military
Snob, CAPTAIN RAG, and the “larking,”
or raffish Military Snob, ENsign FAMish.
Indeed you are fully sure to meet them
lounging on horseback, about five o'clock,
under the trees by the Serpentine, exa-
mining critically the inmates of the
flashy broughams which parade up and
down “the Lady's Mile.”
TAGG and RAG are very well ac-
quainted, and so the former, with that
candour inseparable from intimatefriend-
ship, told me his dear friend's history.
CAPTAIN RAG is a small dapper north-country man. He went when
quite a boy into a crack light cavalry regiment, and by the time he
them lame horses for sound ones, and winning their money by all
manner of strange and ingenious contrivances, that his Colonel advised
him to retire, which he did without much reluctance, accommodating
a youngster, who just entered the regiment, with a glandered charger
at an uncommonly stiff figure.
He has since devoted his time to billiards, steeple-chasing, and the
turf. His head quarters are RUMMER's, in Conduit Street, where he
keeps his kit, but he is ever on the move in the exercise of his voca-
tion as a gentleman jockey and gentleman leg.
According to Bell's Life, he is an invariable attendant at all races,
and an actor in most of them. He rode the winner at Leamington ;
he was left for dead in a ditch a fortnight ago at Harrow ; and yet there
he was, last week, at the Croix de Berny, pale and determined as ever,
astonishing the badauds of Paris by the elegance of his seat and the
neatness of his rig, as he took a preliminary gallop on that vicious
brute, “The Disowned,” before starting for “the French Grand
National.”
He is a regular attendant at the Corner, where he compiles a limited
but comfortable libretto. During the season, he rides often in the
Park, mounted on a clever, well-bred pony. He is to be seen escorting
that celebrated horsewoman, FANNY HIGHFLYER, or in confidential
converse with Lord THIMBLERIG, the eminent handicapper.
He carefully avoids decent society, and would rather dine off a steak
at the One Tun with SAM SNAFFLE the jockey, CAPTAIN O'Rourke,
and two or three other notorious turf robbers, than with the choicest
company in London. He likes to announce at RUMMER's that he is
going to run down and spend his Saturday and Sunday in a friendly
way with Hocus, the leg, at his little box near Epsom, where, if
report speak true, many “rummish plants" are concocted.
He does not play billiards often, and never in public : but when he
does play, he always contrives to get hold of a good flat, and never
leaves him till he has done him uncommonly brown. He has lately
been playing a good deal with FAMish.
When he makes his appearance in a drawing-room, which occasion-
ally happens at a hunt-meeting or a race-ball, he enjoys himself
extremely.
His young friend is ENsign FAM1sh, who is not a little pleased to
be seen with such a smart fellow as RAG, who bows to the best turf
company in the Park. RAG lets FAM1sh accompany him to TATTER-
SALL's, and sells him bargains in horse-flesh, and uses FAMish's cab.
That young gentleman's regiment is in India, and he is at home on
sick leave. He recruits his health by being intoxicated every night,
and fortifies his lungs, which are weak, by smoking cigars all day.
The policemen about the Haymarket know the little creature, and the
early cabmen salute him. The closed doors of fish and lobster shops
less, when some kind friend (in yellow satin) takes care of him. All
the neighbourhood, the cabmen, the police, the early potato-men, and
the friends in yellow satin, know the young fellow, and he is called
Little BoBBY by some of the very worst reprobates in Europe.
His mother, LADY FANNY FAMIsh, believes devotedly that RoRERT
is in London solely for the benefit of consulting the physician; is going
to have him exchanged into a dragoon regiment, which doesn't go to
that odious India ; and has an idea that his chest is delicate, and that
he takes gruel every evening, when he puts his feet in hot water. Her
Ladyship resides at Cheltenham, and is of a serious turn.
Bobby frequents the Union-Jack Club of course ; where he break-
fasts on pale ale and devilled kidneys at three o'clock ; where beard-
less young heroes of his own sort congregate, and make merry, and
give each other dinners ; where you may see half a dozen of young
rakes of the fourth or fifth order lounging and smoking on the steps ;
where you behold SLAPPER's long-tailed leggy mare in the custody of
a red-jacket until the Captain is primed for the Park with a glass of
curaçoa : and where you see Hobby, of the Highland Buffs, driving
up with Dobby, of the Madras Fusiliers, in the great banging, swing-
ing cab, which the latter hires from RUMBLE of Bond Street.
In fact, Military Snobs are of such number and variety, that a
hundred weeks of Punch would not suffice to give an audience to
them. There is, besides the disreputable old Military Snob who has
seen service, the respectable old Military Snob, who has seen none, and
gives himself the most prodigious Martinet-airs. There is the Medi-
cal-Military Snob, who is generally more outrageously military in his
conversation than the greatest sabreur in the army. There is the
Heavy-Dragoon Snob, whom young ladies admire, with his great
stupid pink face and yellow moustachios—a vacuous, solemn, foolish,
but brave and honourable Snob. There is the Amateur Military
Snob, who writes Captain on his cards because he is a Lieutenant
in the Bungdy Militia. There is the Lady-killing Military Snob ;
and more, who need not be named.
But let no man, we repeat, charge Mr. Punch with disrespect for
the army in general—that gallant and judicious army, every man of
which, from F. M. THE DUKE of WELLINGTON, &c., downwards—(with
the exception of H. R. H. FIELD-MARshAL PRINCE ALBERT, who,
however, can hardly count as a military man,) reads Punch in every
quarter of the globe.
Let those civilians who sneer at the acquirements of the army read
SIR HARRY SMITH's account of the Battle of Aliwal. A noble deed
was never told in nobler language. And you who doubt if chivalry
exists, or the age of heroism has passed by—think of SIR HENRY
HARDINGE, with his son, “dear little ARTHUR,” riding in front of the
line at Ferozeshah. I hope no English painter will endeavour to
illustrate that scene ; for who is there to do justice to it * The
history of the world contains no more brilliant and heroic picture.
No, no ; the men who perform these deeds with such brilliant valour,
and describe them with such modest manliness—such are not Snobs.
Their country admires them, their Sovereign rewards them, and Punch,
the universal railer, takes off his hat and says, Heaven save them 1

* A COMMON ANNOYANCE.
JENKINS ON MARRIAGE IN HIGH-LIFE.
A LoNG time since, we announced the death of JENKINs, but now
and then we are induced to believe that we have been shamefully
hoaxed in the matter. Occasionally, we are led to think that JENKINs
is still in the flesh; or, if not, assuredly his spirit now and then haunts
the columns of the Morning Post:—
“E'en in its pages live his wanted fires.”
Now and then we think we detect him, with a wan and ghastly smile,
and a spectral camellia in his spectral button-hole, seated in an opera
box; and have him eloquent in the Post, on the following morning.
Be this as it may, sure we are the spirit of JENKINs visited St.
GEORGE's Church last week in the marriage of but no, fair,
lovely lady, we will not, in the full honeymoon of your happiness—
(and may all your years be lighted by such moons !)—we will not put
your name in the same page with the Snob's who bought his shoulder
of mutton with the reputed history of your nuptials.
In the Morning Post of the 30th of April, 1846, will be found these
lines (with many others):—
“The first of a series of aristocratic alliances which we had the gratification to
announce, about two months since, as about to be solemnized during the present season,
took place yesterday, at St. GeoRGE's Church, Hanover Square, in the presence of a
very numerous circle of the nobility, the parties to the interesting contract being”
Now, we ask it in a friendly spirit, why should JENRINs feel a
“gratification to announce a series of aristocratic alliances 7" Can
it be possible that JENRINs acts in a double capacity ? Is he also
beadle of St. George's, as well as reporter to the Post Or, as MR.
WEIPPERT contracts for the attendance of quadrille bands at parties,
JENRINs may arrange the non-attendance of the marrow-bones and
cleavers.
JENKINs continues :—
“The noble bride arrived at the church in company with her mother at a few minutes
gſtºr the appointed time. On alighting, her Ladyship was received by the expectant
bridegroom, and welcomed in the most affectionate manner by the distinguished circle
assembled to do honour to the occasion. The Duke of WellingtoN was foremost
among the noble individuals who pressed forward to address a few words of congratulation
to her Ladyship.”
The Duke, it is well known, is what the players would call “the
stock-father" on these occasions ; but in the present instance, FIELD-
MARSHAL THE DURE did not give the bride away.
“The bridal procession moved to the altar, headed by the Hon. AND very Rev.
Hºnky Edward HowARd, Dean of Lichfield and Prebendary and Succentor of York,
who, in the absence of his venerable relative, the Archbishop of York, had kindly
undertaken to perform the religious portion of the ceremony.”
When MR. John Cooper, late of Drury Lane, but now, we believe,
of the Princess's, enters before the curtain, and with an appealing look
assures the audience that MR. CoMPToN is suddenly ill, but that MR.
OxBERRY has “kindly undertaken” to play the sick man's part, we
take such announcement as a matter of course. But why should
JENKINs make an apology for the ARCHBishop of York—trumpeting
the “kindness” of the VERY REveREND HENRY Edward HowARD,
Dean of Lichfield, &c., &c., &c.? Surely the VERY REveREND ETCE-
TERA ETCETERA was, as the phrase goes, “up” in the marriage service
Besides, allowing him to be as “slow of study” as Bottom himself, it
amounts to nothing, seeing that custom allows him to read his part.
“The ceremony commenced and proceeded without the slighest incident to mar its
Solemn effect.”
This is told in a tone of disappointment not to be concealed. How
JENRINs would have expanded on hysterics, 'sal-volatile, and burnt
feathers l Nevertheless, JENKINs will have his paragraph :-
“Her Ladyship appeared slightly nervous, and disappointed many whose eyes were
anariously directed towards her, by a studied endeavour to avoid observation. The happy
bridegroom, au contraire, seemed both proud and conscious of the happiness he had
secured.”
If JENKINs were writing an opera notice, could he be more minute,
more artistic, in his description of the actors ?
The brilliancy of the ceremony was, however, wholly attributable to
its moral and religious character ; for—
“ The good old custom of each guest bearing a favour, which by long usage has become
symbolical of wedded happiness, was in the present instance dispensed with. Two solitary
white satin bows were all we saw among the whole assembly, and these BUT served to
render the absence of others more apparent.”
Here we feel for JENRINs.
wedding ceremony; for he was not to be married. But when he read
the disregard of the “good old custom"—when his soul was smitten
by “two solitary white satin bows,” he felt—as a man of the Post he
felt it—the insecurity of our institutions; and left St. George's a
sadder, if not a wiser flunkey.
A YOUNG IRISH MELODY.
(For the “Nation" Newspaper.)
YE English, a rush for your conciliation 1
Alike your persuasion and force we defy;
We detest, we abominate you as a nation,
We hate you the worse the more kindness you try.
Take back in your teeth every boon that you send us ;
At least take our curse, though the gift we retain;
For the object of all your attempts is to mend us,
Whilst such as we are we desire to remain.
We spurn with contempt the instruction you proffer,
Insidiously meant our wild passions to tame;
And although we’ll receive all the food that you offer,
We wish you bad luck while we eat up the same.
To the best law you give us we bear most aversion,
Since order, and quiet, and peace it promotes :
We abhor your Concession far more than Coercion,
As checking more strongly the cutting of throats.
There’s an enmity, Sassenach, that's sown 'twixt our races—
Old Erin may harbour no venomous thing ;
But Young Ireland's the boy that will fly in your faces,
And the hand that would feed him requite with a sting.
CONTINENTAL AMUSEMENTS.
TUEsday being a fine day, the populace of Lisbon turned out early,
and amused themselves by firing. In the evening there was a slight
revolution, but by midnight everything was as quiet as usual. The
damage has been estimated at two broken windows.
In Spain the provinces break out, with all their characteristic love of
amusement, much the same as usual. The soldiers revolt in the
morning, swear allegiance at noon, and revolt again in the evening.
The greatest revelry prevails at Madrid. The palace has been attacked,
and the treasury taken by the mob ; only NARVAEz had taken the
precaution to leave nothing in it. Great preparations are being made
on the grandest scale to surprise ministers with a new fete. Particulars
of this festive revolution will shortly be announced.

THE French are a polite nation ; therefore
we expect that they will return a compliment
very largely paid them in this country. We
allude to the adoption of cant terms borrowed
from their language by British journalists, in
order to denote the things and transactions
of high-life. As, by calling the most fashion-
able sort of people the élite of ton, and speak-
ing of a dancing tea-party as a thé dansant;
whereas it is the party that dances, not the
Hyson; and the tea is quite distinct from
the caper.
Also, by describing a person of dignified de-
meanour as distingué instead of dignified, a
rout as a soirée, and a meat-breakfast as a
déjeaner a la fourchette, just as if everybody
does not use a fork who has a Yarmouth
bloater for that meal. If we, out of admira-
tion for the French language, employ it when
we might full as well talk plain English, the
French ought surely to reciprocate the civi-
lity, particularly since we go out of our way
in deference to them, often using a phraseology
which is at the same time Frenchified and
nonsensical. Accordingly, in their fashion-
able journals, we shall expect to find such

Our neighbours must really consent to a
free interchange, amongst other commodities,
of fashionable slang, or we shall never believe
in the ententecordiale that they talk about.
POLITICAL PHOTOGRAPHY.
Our old political friends are so much in the
habit of appearing with new faces, that it is
really impossible to catch the very various
aspects under which they, from time to time,
present themselves. We would suggest, there-
fore, that the photographic art, which is capa-
ble of catching the momentary expression of
the features, should be applied to Statesmen,
with the view of giving something like perma-
mency to political appearances. We know
that such portraits are frequently not very
flattering to the subjects, for the shadows
are strongly marked, and the general tone is
by no means prepossessing. Still, as a series
of faithful political portraits, a collection made
on the principle we suggest, would be one of
considerable interest to those who might be
curious to know what SIR. R. PEEL was even a
year ago. A photographic likeness of him,
taken even at that comparatively recent
period, would startle those who have only
seen him in his recent character. -

GREAT MORAL LESSON AT MADAME TUSSAUD’S.
ſº- m
|
#molm all filem, That MADAME Tussaud has come out as a great
public teacher. She has converted her Exhibition in Baker Street
into an educational institution, and has resolved herself and Sons into a
Society for the Diffusion of Useful and Entertaining Knowledge. For
she informs us, by Advertisement, that—
WENTY-FIVE MALE AND FEMALE MAGNIFICENT NEW
COURT DRESSES, of surpassing beauty, intended to amuse and instruct the
middle classes, and to give them an idea of regal splendour, are just added to MADAME
Tussaud AND Sons' ExhibiTIox.
The middle classes owe MADAME TUss AUD a large debt of gratitude,
which, it is to be hoped, they will liquidate by many shilling-instal-
ments; and sixpenny ditto in the case of children under eight years of
age. Her Court dresses will, at any rate, amuse them; Court fashions
being singularly absurd. As certainly will they instruct the British
public, by giving it a correct idea of regal splendour, which people
generally imagine to be imposing, and not ludicrous. It is a pity, how-
ever, that the intentions of MADAME TUss AUD should be limited to the
amusement and instruction of the middle classes, since the higher
ranks are, equally with them, in want of the former, and need the latter
somewhat more than they do; especially on a subject which she
could illustrate admirably.
If we were in the place of MADAME Tussaud, we would superadd to

Mr. SMITH O'BRIEN having become very anxious to make himself
the lion of the day, has very properly been accommodated with a den,
by the House of Commons. Every attempt was made, in the first
instance, to subdue the would-be lion; and it was only when the sooth-
ing system had totally failed that restraint was necessarily resorted to.
The Sergeant-at-Arms has been appointed to act as a sort of political
VAN AMBURGH, to keep the lion in subjection. It is true that MR.
SMITH OBRIEN has only assumed the skin of the noble animal, but if
he is such a donkey as to try and pass himself off for a lion—imitating
the roar and the refractory nature of that formidable brute—he must
expect to be treated accordingly. He boasts of his patience, which is a
quality we naturally look for in his case, and we do not wonder, there-
fore, at his professed determination to endure any burden that may be Family at Hanover last week.”—Morning Post.

ment of the Exhibition should be contained in a separate Chamber of

If we had a gift to bestow—such as our artist has indicated in the
annexed Illustration—and if it bore the inscription Detur stuttiori,
we should be sorely puzzled as to whether SMITH O'BRIEN, or
BENJAMIN D'IsrAELI, would be the fitter person for us to bestow it on.
Knowing the fatal consequences of the Judgment of PARIs, we decline
giving a decision in favour of either of the candidates for the crown of
papyrus now lying before us. There is an old saying, that “He whom
the cap fits, may wear it ; ” but the cap in question may fit both, and
a difficulty thus arises which we are quite incapable of determining.

RAILWAY LEGISLATION.
PERHAPs the best method of dealing with the subject of Railway
liabilities would be to pass an Act of Oblivion, of which, in humble imi-
tation of the legislative conciseness of LoRD BRough AM, we beg leave
to suggest the following short form :—
&ſbertad, it is expedient to expunge and entirely obliterate certain
circumstances that have happened within the last year with reference-
to Railway speculation : AND WHEREAs, it is desirable that certain
individuals should be placed in the position in which they were this
time twelvemonths : BE IT THEREFoRE ENACTED, by and with the con-
sent of Parliament, that so much of the last twelve months as relates
to the Railway mania should be repealed, and the last year, so far as
Railway liabilities are concerned, is hereby repealed accordingly. Pro-
VIDED ALways, that nothing in this Act contained shall be construed
into a permission to any person or persons to forget himself or them-
selves on any other subject whatever.
AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That this Act shall be known by the
name of Lethe's Act, or the Act of Oblivion.
AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That any one possessed of scrip to the
amount of twenty pounds, or being a Provisional Director of any Rail-
way, shall be allowed to claim the benefit of this Act, which shall be a
sufficient answer to all his Railway liabilities.
There should, of course, be the usual clause, that the Act may be
amended in the present Session.

“DEAR PUNCH, “Newman Street, Tuesday.

Fashionable Railway Movements.
It is expected that the railway world of
fashion will be in a state of considerable acti.
vity during the ensuing season. The move-
ments of the provisional committee-men and
the allottees are already exciting very general
interest. We are happy to have it in our
power to give the following, which may be
relied upon :-
SIR JASPER GRIGGs, the indefatigable
chairman of the Eastern Archipelago and
Arctic Circle Junction has taken his depar-
ture for Boulogne, where he will remain during
the legal season. He will return to town for
the long vacation.
* An entresol in the rue des Pipots has been
taken by MR. PHELIM O'Doo, who intends
passing the stag-hunting season on the Conti-
ment. The roughness of the sport is the reason
assigned by MR. O'Doo for declining to re-
main in this country during its continuance.
LEvy's hounds had an excellent run one
day last week after a stag of amazing magni-
tude. After traversing Middlesex for some
time, the pack got off the scent, and it was
afterwards ascertained that the object of
pursuit had got away into Surrey, where the
hounds were unable to follow him.
WHO CAN BLAME HIM 2
PRINCE ALBERT was asked why he went
so rarely to an English theatre, and visited so
often the French plays. His answer deserves
to be engraved over the stage door of every
metropolitan theatre. “My reason,” he said,
“is this : nearly all the English pieces are
taken from the French, and do you think I
would go to the translation of a piece as long
as I can see the original 2"

MUSICAL BEDS.
HERE is a paragraph in
the Nonconformist,
which states, that
some genius has
invented a musi-
cal bed, that be-
gins to play a tune
directly you lie
down, and can be
wound up to play
another tune when
you are desirous of

There is one ad-

PUNCH*S POLITICAL DiGTIONARY.
HABEAs CoRPUs. One of the great bulwarks of the British Consti-
tution, and a supplement to Magna Charta. The use of the bulwark
is that any man in custody may, by virtue of the writ, know
what he is in custody for ; a piece of knowledge that can only be re-
quired by a gentleman so inundated with executions that he scarcely
knows one from the other, and is desirous of being informed at whose
suit he has been pounced upon.
HANAPER. From Hanaperium, a hamper, in which the writs of
Chancery were formerly kept. The hamperitself is abolished, but the
clerkship of it continues, and is a sinecure office of £468 a year—a
salary which the public is somewhat unfairly hampered with.
HERALD. An officer by whom, in the middle ages, “messages and
parcels were carefully delivered.” It was also his duty to lay out the
lists for tournaments, which comprised, no doubt, the careful beating
of carpets, while his presence as an attendant at the banquets which
followed made him a regular waiter at evening parties. The modern
Herald has very little to do, and is only a superior kind of beefeater.
HERALDs’ College. A sort of Snobs' university, in which par-
rite airs of some of
the most popular
composers.
should think, how-
ever, that there must be some tact required in adapting the musical
compositions to the required purposes. It would be very injudicious,
for instance, to attempt to send any one to sleep with a quadrille of
MUsARD, while to try and wake any one up with a bit of SEBAstian
BACH, or a morceau of Juvenile-England classicality, would be equally
preposterous. The invention certainly opens quite a new field to
many of those long-haired and turned-down-collar composers, who
will now have a splendid chance of bringing their composing talents to
bear upon those who are soliciting the sometimes-obstinate MoRPHEUs.
There are several rising young men, who have been rising for the last
twenty years, and who are admirably adapted to the task of setting
four-posts and French bedsteads to somniferous music. We presume
that the idea has been taken from the Chamber Concerts, which have
recently become popular.
Considering the awful infliction it is, to be compelled to hear the
music of certain persons whom we could but will not name, the
addition of their music to a bed might turn it into a regular lit de
justice, or shocking instrument of cruelty.
The arrangement by which one is to be woke up at any hour, com-
prises a march, with drum and cymbal accompaniments. Such a
charirari might not be always very welcome when it came; for, though
one often goes to bed with a very valiant determination to get up very
early, it is extremely natural to alter one's mind by the morning. If
we often get angry with the person calling us, and disturbing our rest,
what should we say to the drums and cymbals going through a regular
march, at a most unseasonable hour 7 For our own parts we should
muffle the drums at once with our bolster, and suffocate the cymbals
with our goose-feather bed. We should recommend that, if the princi-
ple is carried out, the airs chosen should be appropriate to the kind of
beds they might be adapted to. “Oh rest thee, babe, rest thee, babe,”
would do very well for an infant's cot, while “Rise, gentle Moon,”
would be suited to the purpose of waking a celebrated alderman.
self-POSSESSION.
Mansial. Bugeaud, in addressing the Duke D'AUMALE, made fre-
quent allusions to “my army, my soldiers,” &c. It will be next “my
people, my Africa; ” but we are afraid it will be a long time before the
Marshal will be able to say “my ABD-EL-KADER.”
Railway. Curiosity.
THE Papers inform us that not a single accident has occurred on the
Jamaica Railway during the last quarter | The Directors of the
Eastern Counties have sent out agents to Jamaica to look at this
Railway, for they will not believe there exists such a phenomenon.
PenAL CODE FOR EDITORS.
IN Spain, editors are imprisoned; in France, they are decorated
with the Cross of the Legion of Honour. We do not know which is the
greater punishment.
Wes.
venus take their degrees of respectability.
| HERALDRY. The art of arranging coats of arms and badges;
though Heraldry does not teach the proper position of the badge on
the breast of the omnibus driver, conductor, or waterman. The
earliest specimen of Heraldry known in this country is of the time of
Edward THE FIRST, whose badge was a badger.
HUE AND CRY. The old Common Law method of pursuing felons
with horn and voice ; though the Hue and Cry were only used for
crimes of the darkest hue, and for crying evils.
IMPORTs AND ExpoRTs. The Ins and Outs of Commerce.
INconſe-TAx. A triennial periodical, or permanent burden imposed
for temporary purposes.
INDENTURE. A legal deed : from in, and dens, a tooth—a derivation
showing that it is an instrument by which the law sticks its teeth
pretty sharply into him who has to pay for it.
FASHIONABLE ARRANGEMENTS.
ONE of the daily fashionable organs informs its readers that the
fashionable season is likely to be dull, and then proceeds to give a list
of the probable arrangements for the next few weeks. We beg to add
to the list the following “further arrangements,” which will add mate-
|rially to the attractions of the beau monde –
Mrs. EIDERDown will give a series of the et tournez dehors (tea and
turn outs) at her suburban residence in the Kennington Oval.
During the month of May Mr. BRIEFLEss will throw open his cham-
| bers to the élite of the legal world, who will be invited, twice a week,
to a matinée muffinesque, which is expected to surpass the recherché
spreads which gave so much gaiety to the Temple in the course of
the last season.
The loss of ALDERMAN STAG will be much felt in the City. His house
will, however, be the scene of one grand levée during the season, at
MR. Jones has it in contemplation to give a rapid succession of leg-
of-mutton dimmers at his lodgings in Stamford Street. These delightful
little réunions à la jigot created a great sensation last season, and it is
expected they will this year be equally popular.
BARoN NATHAN will throw open his old ancestral hall at Kennington
for a series of Polka soirées during the whole of the new-laid egg season.
He will resume his delightful capers among the eggs, which have never
been equalled since the celebrated performance of the donkey among
the chickens.
The German trumpeters will continue their delightful extempora-
neous soirées in the open air. In the true spirit of foreign hospitality,
these entertainments will be “open to all parties and influenced by
none,” except the policeman on duty.
which it is expected the Sheriff will be represented by one of his officers.
A CHEAP TRIP.
Upwards of 7,000 tons of gravel have been shipped from New York
since September last for the purpose of beautifying the parks and
gardens of London. According to this, a Yankee domiciled in London
would be able to tread again his native soil without going any further
| than Hyde Park.

Governesses BENEvoleNT INSTITUTION.
IN furtherance of the objects of this most useful charity, it is in con-
templation to establish a School,for the purpose of preparing young ladies
destined to be governesses, for the situations they are intended to fill.
The necessity of teaching those who are to be teachers, and of instruct-
ing the governess how to govern, is obvious ; the pupils, accordingly,
will learn all the modern languages and accomplishments—geography,
astronomy, the use of the globes, and so much of moral philosophy as
includes the true principles of education. But as the social position of
a governess is a peculiar one, being, as a novelty, rather uncomfortable,
though, like a certain process to which eels are subjected, nothing
when anybody is used to it. ‘ One great object of this School will be to
familiarise the pupils with the life they may expect to lead. Its
arrangements will therefore comprise a system of training calculated
for the inculcation of an amount of practical as well as moral
philosophy adequate to this purpose.
To the Institution will be attached a Servants' Hall, wherein, at
stated times, will attend a number of footmen and other menials, to
intercourse with whom the future governess may be habituated, and
whose insults and impertinences she may learn betimes to put up with.
A nursery will also be connected with it, in order to exercise her
patience in the management of refractory children, at which proba-
tion the students will take turns. The children will be selected
from the most purse-proud families, and their mammas will drop in
every now and then, daily, and reprimand and find fault capriciously
and unjustly with their preceptress, so as to inure her to such treat-
ment. Some charitable ladies of great style, in the vicinity of Russell
Square, have volunteered their services in this particular. One of
these ladies will, moreover, preside regularly at dinner to teach the
language of looks, that the learner may understand, from a glance,
when she is to refuse wine, or to decline another helping.
Evening parties will be given occasionally, in the schoolroom, and to
them will be invited a number of agreeable men, that the “young per-
sons” may know how to behave in society; that is, to hold their
tongues and sit still.
ters, by whom the scholars are to be studiously snubbed, by way of a
lesson to them in meekness under contumely. The novices, during
leisure hours, are to sit in separate apartments, accessible to all the
servants, who, however, will not be allowed to wait upon them, or
bring them any refreshment, if hungry from the insufficiency of their
meals. Their dresses are to be such as a young lady can afford upon
twenty pounds a year, finding herself in everything but her victuals,
and not having, by half, as much of those as she can eat.
Thus, it may be hoped, will governesses be provided with qualifica-
tions high enough, wants few enough, and spirit humble enough, to
meet the views of any lady in the land. -

black rain fell in the northern part of Worcestershire last week. For

CHAP. XI.-ON CLERICAL SNOBS.
AFTER Snobs military, Snobs clerical
- suggest themselves quite naturally,
and it is clear that, with every
respect for the cloth, yet having
a regard for truth, humanity, and
the British public, such a vast
and influential class must not be
omitted from our notices of the
great Snob world.
Of these Clerics there are some
whose claim to snobbishness is
undoubted, and yet it cannot be
discussed here. for the same
reason that Punch would not set

himself not privileged to make a noise, and puts away his show, and
silences his drum, and takes off his hat, and holds his peace.
And I know this, that if there are some Clerics who do wrong, there
are straightway a thousand newspapers to haul up those unfortunates,
and cry, Fie upon them, fie upon them while, though the press is
always ready to yell and bellow excommunication against these stray
delinquent parsons, it somehow takes very little count of the many
good ones—of the tens of thousands of honest men, who lead Christian
lives, who give to the poor generously, who deny themselves rigidly,
and live and die in their duty, without ever a newspaper paragraph in
their favour. My beloved friend and reader, I wish you and I could
do the same . and let me whisper my belief, entre nous, that of those
eminent philosophers who cry out against parsons the loudest, there
are not many who have got their knowledge of the church by going
thither often.
But you who have ever listened to village bells, or have walked to
church as children on sunny Sabbath mornings ; you who have ever
seen the parson's wife tending the poor man's bedside ; or the town
clergyman threading the dirty stairs of noxious alleys upon his sacred
business ;-do not raise a shout when one of these falls away, or yell
with the mob that howls after him.
Every man can do that. When old FATHER No.AH was overtaken
in his cups, there was only one of his sons that dared to make merry
at his disaster, and he was not the most virtuous of the family. Let
us too turn away silently, nor huzza like a parcel of school-boys,
because some big young rebel suddenly starts up and whaps the
schoolmaster.
I confess, though, if I had by me the names of those seven or eight
Irish bishops, the probates of whose wills were mentioned in last
year's journals, and who died leaving behind them some two hundred
thousand pounds apiece—I would like to put them up as patrons of
my Clerical Snobs, and operate upon them as successfully as I see
from the newspapers MR. Eisen BERG, Chiropodist, has lately done
upon “His GRACE THE RIGHT REveREND LORD Bishop of TAPIoCA.”
And I confess, that when those Right Reverend Prelates come up to
the gates of Paradise with their probates of wills in their hands, I con-
fess I think that their chance is " " " " But the gates of Paradise
is a far way to follow their Lordships ; so let us trip down again, lest
awkward questions be asked there about our own favourite vices too.
And don't let us give way to the vulgar prejudice, that clergymen
arean over-paid and luxurious body of men. When that eminent ascetic,
the late SYDNEY SMITH-(by the way, by what law of nature is it that
so many Smiths in this world are called SIDNEY SMITH 7)—lauded
the system of great prizes in the Church,-without which he said gen-
tlemen would not be induced to follow the clerical profession ; he
admitted most pathetically that the Clergy in general were by no
means to be envied for their worldly prosperity. From reading the
works of some modern writers of repute, you would fancy that a par-
son's life was passed in gorging himself with plum-pudding and port-
wine ; and that his Reverence's fat chaps were always greasy with the
crackling of tithe pigs. Caricaturists delight to represent him so ;
round, short-necked, pimple-faced, apoplectic, bursting out of waistcoat,
like a black-pudding, a shovel-hatted fuzz-wigged SILENUs. Whereas,
if you take the real man, the poor fellow's flesh-pots are very scantily
furnished with meat. He labours commonly for a wage that a tailor's
foreman would despise: he has, too, such claims upon his dismal income
as most philosophers would rather grumble to meet ; many tithes are
levied upon his pocket, let it be remembered, by those who grudge him
his means of livelihood. He has to dine with the Squire ; and his
wife must dress neatly; and he must “look like a gentleman,” as they
call it, and bring up his six great hungry sons as such. Add to this,
if he does his duty, he has such temptations to spend his money as no
mortal man could withstand. Yes; you who can't resist purchasing a
chest of cigars, because they are so good ; or an or-molu clock at
Howell and JAMEs's, because it is such a bargain ; or a box at the
Opera, because LABLACHE and GR1s.I are divine in the Puritani; fancy
how difficult it is for a parson to resist spending a half-crown when
John BREAKstone's family are without a loaf ; or “standing” a bottle
of port for poor Polly RABBITs, who has her thirteenth child ; or
treating himself to a suit of corduroys for little Bob ScAREcRow,
whose breeches are sadly out at elbows. Think of these temptations,
brother moralists and philosophers, and don't be too hard on the
parson.
But what is this? Instead of “showing up " the parsons, are we
indulging in maudlin praises of that monstrous black-coated race O
saintly FRANCIs, lying at rest under the turf. O JIMMY, and JoHNNY,
and WILLY, friends of my youth ! O noble and dear old ELIAs how
should he who knows you, not respect you and your calling 2 May

On cash he was always bent ;
He called for the gold so yellow,
And they forked out the Irish rent.

And widows, their last mites halving,

Though his children wanted clothes ;
And the peasant, a penny turning,

CHARIVARI.
-
SoME curiosity has been excited in the public mind to know what is really the process by
which Dr. REID proposes to blow, not only hot and cold, but all the intermediate degrees
of tepid, freezing, and temperate, into the Houses of Parliament. We can only conceive
that he contemplates suspending a series of bellows in the roof of the building, all of which
will be worked by machinery hung on ropes, and running along upon pulleys... The ropes
may be so arranged that any member may pull one of them as he would a bell, and thus
discharge upon himself any amount or quality of atmosphere he may feel a fancy for.
LoRD BRocGHAM, who is very fond of an opportunity of giving himself a puff, will thus be
always in a position to indulge in his favourite luxury.
One would imagine that such a contrivance as that we have described would hardly
justify the extreme self-conceit of DR. REID, the originator of the plan; but it must be
remembered that the self-importance and conceit of the man who blows the bellows, have
become the subject of a proverb. There is, it will be seen, every kind of air in DR. REID's

MARRIAGES IN MIDIDLE LIFE.
HILE some of our fashionable contemporaries are con-
gratulating themselves on being able to announce a
series of marriages in the circles of haut ton, we are in
a state of ecstatic happiness at being in a position to
record a delightful series of nuptial knots, which are
about to be tied in the middle ranks of society.
A marriage is on the carpet—or perhaps we should
rather say, on the drugget, in this instance—between
the dashing and decisive HoRAtio Twang, the Hay's
Court Dentist, and the lovely Miss LAviNLA LIGHT-
Foot, the daughter of the extensive builder (of bon-
nets) in Cranbourne Alley. The friends of both parties
#| are what is usually called agreeable, except an old
#| maternal uncle on the side of the bridegroom, who
makes himself as disagreeable as possible.
While only the preliminaries have been arranged
for this happy match, we are delighted to be able to
give the particulars of a little hymeneal affair which
came off last week at St. George's—(in the East,
Wapping.) The bridal party arrived in two omnibuses, while a Hansom equipage—we
mean a HANsoM cab–was in readiness to take the happy couple to the London Bridge
Packet Station, with a view to a honey-week at Gravesend. The bride, who is the
eldest unmarried daughter of MR. GUBBINs, the great coal and potato merchant, and who
consequently had, like Love,
“Once lived in a humble shed,”
wore a stout cotton velvet, and being herself rather stout, the effect was extremely pleasing.
She was attended to the altar by her seven sisters from Edmonton, and by a number of
infantine creatures who had formed part of a mob of boys and girls that had collected to
see the marriage 'buses discharge their cargoes.
The bridegroom, who has three flys of his own, with considerable good taste declined
the display that he might have made by driving himself to church in either of the vehicles.
He came in the cab already alluded to, and was given away by the cabman, who was an
early friend, having been brought up in the same livery stable with the happy Benedict.
Such was the recollection of the past, that each had a drop in his eye before the com-
mencement of the ceremony. Immediately after its conclusion, the wedding party repaired
to the house of the uncle of the bride, who, through some mistake, had no wedding break-
fast in readiness. It was ultimately arranged to adjourn to an adjacent tea-garden, where
an elegant déjeúner a la pain et fromage was laid out
on a table ; and beer having been called for, at first
sparingly, but ultimately with much liberality, the
festivities were prolonged until a late period of
the evening.

SINCE the consumption of British produce
should be the desire of the British heart, whilst,
at the same time, the British nomenclature is a
disqualification to it in the British mind, whereas
it goes down or is swallowed very readily under a
foreign one ; and since this particularly applies to
wines, we beg to recommend to public favour some
excellent beverages of this description, as old
friends under new names. This peculiar advan-
tage, in addition to their quality and flavour, is
their moderate price, which renders them very
eligible for the families of small capitalists, or
large economists. We shall specify :—
1. The Gingerberger.—This, particularly diluted
with a little water, is a light and agreeable dinner
| wine, and possesses cordial and stomachic proper-
|ties, which challenge competition with Vermuth,
|Gingerberger, having all the sparkles of that ar-
|ticle without any of its bitterness.
2. The Elderberger.—This so-called rich and lus-
|cious potation is likewise a powerful cordial, and
carries a fine bouquet. Elderberger is very fruity.
|It is a splendid supper-wine, particularly on a
cold frosty night, and may without vulgarity be
said emphatically to be spicy.
3. The Currantsheim has a pleasant tartness, and
is a most agreeable accompaniment to a piece of
plum-cake. It may confidently be offered to the
younger classes of students, male and female.
4. The Sparkling Groseille need not be mentioned
when introduced at dinner parties ; and it will
then be unhesitatingly drunk as Champagne.
When we consider how frequently the vintage
of the hedge-pick is relished as fine “Old Crusted,”
and the amount of bees’-wing, which as such it is
found to contain, we shall readily see that, in order
to be appreciated, four native liquors need only
foreign titles, just as the Monsieur gives a cur-
rency to the BALFE, and the HERR an interest to
the name of MUGGINs.
THE FALLS OF FLEET STREET.
It is not, perhaps, generally known that the
legitimate successors of HENRY VIII. and CARDI-
NAL Wolsey are HoNEY and SKElton, the hair-
dressers. These individuals have got the old palace
in front of the Temple gate, to which there is no
objection ; but they have a sad habit of washing
the outside with pails of water, which they pour
down on the devoted heads of the passengers.
A shower-bath is sometimes refreshing ; but it
is awkward when it is administered without notice
to a person wearing a new hat, and not by any
means prepared for a ducking. We have been
personally drenched three times within the last
week, by an individual attempting to wash the
face of the old palace of HENRY VIII. and his
friend the Cardinal. HoREY and Skelton ought
not to keep up a continual Niagara in front of
their premises.

THE ARISTOCRACY OF GOLD.
UNCH is about to suggest new
honours for the wealthy.
In truth, they need them.
In these revolutionary
days, when that very
grave owl, the Wisdom of
our Ancestors, is abused
as nothing better than a
great goose, we feel that
the rich have a peculiar
claim upon our compassion.
Poor things The hypo-
critical world seems to
have suddenly fallen in
love with LAzARUs, pet-
ting him with at least fine
phrases, whilst Dives is
abused after Billingsgate
fashion. The world—like
an old harlotry penitent
—has fallen in love with
rags and tatters, and spits
out her shrewish words
at brocade and lace. At
this moment, reflecting
upon what the wealthy
have to endure from a
glib-tongued generation, it
would take a very large
sum, indeed, to make us
consent to be rich. No ;
we will “tread upon the
pride of PLAro,” as PLAro
said, “with greaterpride.”
We will wrap our old
cloak about us, looking
the more loftily fºr the
Nothing shall ever make us rich ; nevertheless, we will show that we
have bowels for the unfortunate wealthy. Gather aboutus, then, ye
poor despised men of money-bags, and give attentive ear to what we
propose for ye. It is a genial season, this, and we feel our heart open
—as did the pine that shut up Ariel—and a good spirit come out
of it to work dainty devices. Now, while the earth has its coat of
green—or petticoat, the earth being feminine—in its soft newness;
now, whilst the birds sing, and as prettily sings a Warwick poetess—
“The butterflies, in colours rare,
Dance to the music of the air;"
now, touched by the bounty of the season, will we proclaim ourselves
—The Rich Man's Friend ? The poor have friends enough, with all
Young England to dance with them round the Maypole, to notch for
them at cricket, and to crown their glowing brows with “everything
that pretty bin,”—whilst the unhappy rich,--but let us not be
subdued into unmanly softness. We will dry our eyes, and take
another dip of ink.
So, as the wicked insolence of the world does all it can to revile
wealth, let wealth make for itself a titular aristocracy. Let PLUTUs
turn Herald, and, after his own fashion, ennoble his children. Why
should we give titles to men who bleed and make bleed in the field,
and refuse them to those unfortunate children of MAMMON, who make
others bleed on the Stock Exchange 2 If a man make for himself a
plum, nay, half a plum, ought he not—upon giving good Bank of
England evidence of the fact—to be raised to what, for the time, we
will call the Money Peerage 2 May not his victories over difficulties
—his ambush-work—his feints—his sharpshooting in the acquirement
of the said plum, be equal to the triumphs on the field of battle, or on
the floor of Parliament 2 And what, we ask, is the encouragement
for men to be wealthy in these days, seeing that the poor are so shame-
fully put over the head of the rich 2 What comfort has any man—
we ask for no compassion in our own case—in the possession of half
a million of money, if it is only to make him the shining target to be
fired at by the indignation of pauper virtue 2 Money ought, there-
fore, to ennoble its possessor. Directly the calf was gilt inch-thick,
it should no longer be mere JoHN CALF, but at least LoRD WITELLUs.
patches on the garment.
However, let us put a case. DoDDLEs, a stockbroker, with sons
and daughters, proves to the Heralds' College (to be instituted in the
Bank Parlour) that he has a million of money: whereupon he imme-
diately receives his patent of nobility; the titles for himself and family
running as follow (to be varied according to circumstances, by the
Herald PENNY weight KING-AT-CAsh):—
THE DURE of BULLION. (DoDDLEs himself.)
THE MARQUIs of Goldbar. (DoDDLEs' son and heir.)
LoRD Dollar,
LoRD Two-AND-six,
LoRD FourPENNYBIT,
LoRD Two PENNY.
LADY MARY Bob,
LADY JULIA SixPENCE,
LADY AugustA FARTHING.
Younger sons of DoDDLEs.
} Daughters of DoDDLEs.
And then, for minor branches, there might be the Hon. MR. TIN, MR.
STUMPY, MR. BRADs, MR. REXPENNINARUM, and so forth ; the names
being popular synonyms for money. And whereas, what are now used
as terms of reproach, might, assumed by the ennobled rich, be turned
into titles of honour. Thus, in process of time, we might hope to see
men take off their hats very reverently to the DUKE of Root-of-Evil,
the MARQUIs of Yellowth Ash, the EARL of FILTHYLucRE, and the
like. As it is, it is dreadful for the well-regulated mind (we mean our
own, of course,) to contemplate the increasing contempt for the
wealthy, and the growing love for the poor. Something ought to be
done to stop this social revolution, and it is our modesty to think that
we have suggested the most efficient means.

MANY complaints have been made of the postmen having been em-
ployed to advertise, in the course of their rounds, Kelly's Post-Office
Directory. If the principle of turning postmen into puffers for private
property is to be admitted, we think much trouble would be saved by
clapping a board round their necks with an effective bill pasted over it,
in the style adopted by the itinerant advertisers of MADAME Tussaud,
or the myrmidons of Moses. Instead of leaving a prospectus at each
door, the plan we suggest would be a saving of time and an extension of
publicity. A postman with a bill-board over his breast would be alto-
gether a very attractive novelty, and might fairly calculate on having a
mob at his heels; which, though it might impede the public service,
would well answer the purpose of the proprietor of the Directory.

MORE NOVELTY
|N THE SHIRT WAY.
THE
DRURY-LANE FUND IDINNER.
BEFoRE we proceed, let us apologise
to our readers. We have been mis-
informed. The Fund Dinner has taken
place, and MR. HARLEY has made
his speech Had a “DANIEL come to
judgment,” it could not have been
better. The plate did go round ; but
MR. HARLEY did not, as we were
informed he would, name the amount
of balance on the books, the number
of actors and actresses engaged at
Drury Lane, and what they had acted
during the past and present seasons to
vindicate the dignity and utility of
the drama. Neither did he state that,
in consequence of the condition of
s
N
Drury Lane, the number of actors
joining the Fund must amount to little
more than nil, leaving a thumping
balance for the present fortunate sub- -
scribers. MR. HARLEY said nothing
of these things ; nevertheless, his
speech was very beautiful, and full
to overflowing with truth—playhouse
truth. For instance, he observed with
wonderful gravity:
“This brilliant assembly is one of many triumphant proofs of the high estimation in
which the drama is held by the RANK and intelligence of England.”
This is quite as true as it is eloquent.
least a Duke and a Lord or two—dine at the Freemasons' Tavern, and
prove, by their knives and forks, their devotion to the stage. They
eat and drink, and therefore patronise ! Besides, does not the Morn-
ing Post annually publish the list of noble subscribers to the Haymarket
and Sadler's Wells And was not Covent Garden “so esteemed” by
“rank” that it was shut up, lest it break down under the weight of
nobility thronging it 7 And HARLEY knew this, and looked gravely
as a Bishop at the DUKE of BEAUFort, while he spoke it.
There is, however, touching beauty in this burst about England :
it makes us feel very proud of our country —
“England 1. pre-eminent in arts, invincible in arms, the triple jewels of whose imperial
crown are justice, mercy, and charity; and it well deserves the proud distinction. Our
sublimest poet has enriched it with his immortal scenes, and a bright host of kindred
spirits, in succeeding times, have wound up the intellectual charm.”
We are sure this is very fine, or HARLEY would not have uttered it.
Not he. And then, taking breath, MR. HARLEY asked,
“In what relation to the drama stands the actor?”
Whereupon, a cynic at the lower end of the table observed, in a
low voice,—“Why, at Drury Lane, in the relation of a very poor
relation ; seeing that at that theatre the two never come together.”
HARLEY, however, made a mistake. The Times—publishing letters
touching these funds—called for a balance-sheet, and the number
(not the names) of the annuitants. Whereupon, the orator continued—
“You have hitherto taken our word that the recipients of your bounty are in every
A PRIVATE OPINION.
“well, 1 THINK THIs Is THE NEATEST THING 1 Have seen Fon
A Long TIME.”
The rank of England—at
way worthy of it. This generous confidence
has rendered the gift doubly acceptable. Are
grateful blessings less efficacious because we do
not ostentatiously proclaim by whom they are
individually breathed ”
No, no, HARLEY ; the names were
not required; it was merely the num-
ber, and—the balance-sheet. But next
year, no doubt, both will be forthcom-
ing. Otherwise, eloquent HARLEY,
subscribers may button their pockets,
seeing that they are called upon to
pay in the dark. Whilst Drury Lane
employed a company of comedians,
it was very right indeed in “rank and
intelligence” to subscribe, but whilst
| you yourself, HARLEY, stand alone the
solitary comic pillar of the edifice,
and whilst for the most part foreign
singers and dancers (who cannot by
its laws claim upon the Fund) com-
pose the company, the public will, we
fear, in a season or two, look very
black at the Drury Lane plate. The
Jolly Beggars, though a tolerably amu-
sing piece, may tire on too frequent
repetition at the Freemasons' Tavern.
THEATRICAL INTELLIGENCE.
We are happy to hear that Richardson's Theatre will remain open
at the next Greenwich Fair for an additional day, if the proprietor can
succeed in obtaining congés for the unlimited corps de ballet and indefi-
nite string of figurantes engaged at his establishment. The Ghost will,
it is feared, be compelled to fulfil a provincial engagement as Scarecrow
during the months preceding the harvest, when the corn requires pro-
tection ; and, unless a further congé can be obtained, the Ghost cannot
continue the attractive series of solemn warnings which were so popular
at Easter last, and will be eagerly looked for during Whitsuntide.
The premiére danseuse must also give up her present engagement
at RICHARDson's, unless her congé can be bought from the gentleman
with the Pandean pipes and drum, to whom she is under an engagement
to give a series of Highland Flings on stilts, through a four weeks' tour
in the suburbs. -
Great exertions are however being made to obtain a further congé;
and it is a remarkable fact that Mr. Bolton, the author-manager, and
lessee of the Olympic, is in the same predicament with some of his
danseuses, who are under engagements from which nothing but a congé
can relieve them. We, of course, wait with much anxiety the result of
the negotiations in both cases. -
THE CURIOSITIES OF ADVERTISING.
AN advertisement the other day announced a reward of one guinea
for “a large Spanish blue gentleman's cloak, lost in the neighbourhood of
the Haymarket.” We can fancy any gentleman looking rather blue at
the loss of his cloak, but there is something odd in his advertising the
fact of his blueness in connection with the loss of his garment.

nearly had the honer of being kinected, acurd a few weex sins, when
the LADY ANGELINA S-, daughter of the EARL of B–CREs,
presented the gallant Capting, her usband, with a Son & hair.
Nothink would satasfy her Ladyship but that her old and atacht fam-
dy-shamber, my wife MARY HANN Plush, should be presnt upon this
hospicious occasion. CAPTING S- was not jellus of me on account
of my former attachment to his Lady. I cunsented that my MARY
HANN should attend her, and me, my wife, and our dear babby acawd-
ingly set out for our noable frend's residence, Honeymoon Lodge, near
Cheltenham.

so in complament to his noble Godmanma) craddle, and a small supply

rose-coloured Satting & Pink lace hangings, held up by a gold tuttle-

low, 73 packidges in all.
We got on very well as far as Swindon, where, in the Splendid
Refreshment room, there was a galaxy of lovely gals in cottn velvet
spencers, who serves out the soop, and 1 of whom maid an impresshn
upon this Art which I shoodn't like MARY HANN to know—and here,
to our infanit disgust, we changed carridges. I forgot to say that we
were in the secknd class, having with us JAMEs HANGELo, and 23
other light harticles.
“Fust inconveniance; and almost as bad as break of gage. I cast
my hi upon the gal in cottn velvet, and wanted some soop, of coarse;
but seasing up JAMEs HANGELo (who was layin his dear little pors on
an Am Sangwidg) and seeing my igspresshn of hi—‘JAMEs,’ says
Y HANN, “instead of looking at that young lady—and not so very
young, neither—be pleased to look to our packidges, & place them, in
the other carridge.' I did so with an evy Art. I eranged them 23
articles in the opsit carridg, only missing my umbrella & baby's
rattle ; and jest as I came back for my baysn of soop, the beast of
a bell rings, the whizzling injians proclayms the time of our departure,

it was my losing the umbrella. If it had been a cotton velvet umberella
I could have understood. JAMEs HANGELo sittn on my knee was
evidently unwell; without his coral : & for 20 miles that blessid
babby kep up a rawring, which caused all the passingers to simpithize
with him igseedingly.
“We arrive at Gloster, and there fansy my disgust at bein ableeged
to undergo another change of carriages Fansy me holding up moughs,

peration, “I shall throttle this darling if he goes on.’ ‘Do,” says she-
‘and go into the refreshment room, says she-a snatchin the babby out
of my arms. “Do go,' says she, “youre not fit to look after luggage,’
and she began lulling JAMEs HANGELo to sleep with one hi, while she
looked after the packets with the other. “Now, Sir 1 if you please,
mind that packet !—pretty darling—easy with that box, Sir, its glass
ty poppet—where's the deal case, marked arrowroot, No. 24 P*
she cried, reading out of a list she had.—And poor little JAMEs went
to sleep. The porters were bundling and carting the various harticles
with no more ceremony than if each package had been of cannon-ball.
“At last—bang goes a package marked “Glass,” and containing the
Chayny bowl and LADY BAREACREs’ mixture, into a large white band-
box, with a crash and a smash. “It’s My Lady's box from CRINo-
LINE’s cries MARY HANN; and she puts down the child on the bench,
and rushes forward to inspect the dammidge. You could hear the
Chayny bowls clinking inside; and LADY B.'s mixture (which had the
igsack smell of cherry brandy) was dribbling out over the smashed
bandbox containing a white child's cloak, trimmed with Blown lace
and lined with white satting.
“As JAMEs was asleep, and I was by this time uncommon hungry, I
thought I would go into the Refreshment Room and just take a little
soup ; so I wrapped him up in his cloak and laid him by his mamma,
and went off. There's not near such good attendance as at Swindon.

“We took our places in the carriage in the dark, both of us covered
with a pile of packages, and MARY HANN so sulky that she would not
speak for some minutes. At last she spoke out—

JENRINs (he is certainly come again) in the Post, says—
“We are happy to be able to correct a rumour that was prevalent at the west end of
the town on Saturday, to the effect that a marriage had been clandestinely solemnised
at St. George's, Hanover Square, between a commoner of family and fortune, and the
LADY ANNA Eliza MARY GRENville, daughter of the DUKE of BuckINGHAM AND
CHANDos.” |
Now, why should JENRINs be happy? What has the celibacy of
LADY GRENVILLE to do with his felicity ? JENKINs is surely not of
the house of CHANDos : he can fear no blot in his scutcheon. Then,
again we ask it, wherefore is he happy? At the disappointment of
the lovers ? Stony-hearted JENRINs 1
Smithfield Intelligence.
OUR Smithfield correspondent writes to us in a state of gloomy des-
pondency. A general flatness prevailed in all sorts of meats, and veal
was as dead as mutton. There was a terrible glut of beef, and several
cows got their horns crumpled in the crowd. A few south downs
exhibited a slight upward tendency, but they went into a rapid decline
before the close of business, a decline caused by a want of general
consumption. Pigs fell when taken by the leg, and fine old steers were so
depressed that it required several doses of STEER's opodel.doc to bring
them up again. There was in the course of the day a buoyancy in
heifers, but the (h)effervescence was only temporary.

RESULTS OF RAILWAY SPEcul-ATION.
PUNCH'S LITERARY REVIEW.
Catalogue of the Exhibition of the Royal Academy, for 1846.
This is a very amusing work, and its circulation will no doubt be
large in proportion to its merits. It opens with a sprightly little essay,
called, modestly enough, a Notice to Exhibitors, which is chiefly ad-
dressed to those who do not exhibit at all, but are under the necessity
of carting off their rejected pictures at their earliest convenience.
More might perhaps have been made of this touching topic. A beau-
tiful picture might have been drawn of the would-be RuBENs, loitering
about Trafalgar Square, and listening to the gentle splashing of the
fountains, before he could venture to make inquiry of the porter, and
fainting in the arms of that official on hearing of the rejection of his
pet picture.
This, however, has been lost sight of, and we must therefore look at
the Catalogue as what it is, wafting away, with a sigh of regret, the
conception of what, in more poetical hands, it might have been. There
is a fine commercial spirit in the announcement, that “Persons
desirous to become purchasers, &c., may apply to the Clerk.” We think
it should have been added, that “Persons desirous of going home in a
cab, may apply to the waterman.”
Having read, in the preliminary chapter of the Catalogue, that “No
advertisement, unnecessary quotation, or narrative, can be admitted,”
we were surprised to find a gentleman advertised at No. 63 as a K. H.,
F.R.S., H.E.I.C.S.—within four letters of half the alphabet. We really
think that, for the general convenience, it should be arranged that
every person exhibiting his portrait should be limited to a couple of
vowels and four consonants, or a liquid and two mutes, or a brace of
diphthongs by themselves; which would have a very imposing appear-
ance.
... No one can object to a puff for HER Most GRAcious MAJESTY; but
it is hardly allowable that Number 66 should include an advertisement
of the Blue Coat School, of which, we are told in the Catalogue, HER
MAJEsty has condescended to become a Benefactor and Governor.
This grand puff de deuz is a proceeding we feel we ought to discounte-
nance. We should have thought that F.M. THE Duke of WELLINGron
had experienced puffing enough, but MR. Pickersgill's picture of him
is made the occasion of a quotation from Macbeth, to prove the Duke's
courage. The four lines in which we are told, “’tis much he dares,
&c.," might well have been cut out, as superfluous, from the Royal
Academy Catalogue.
No 296 would have afforded a fine opportunity for historical writing,
by a description of the battle of Trafalgar. Unhappily, however, the
author. has sunk down into a mere showman's account of a penny
exhibition. Look to the right, and you will see “the Dingy being
|just then sent by CAPTAIN HARDY with LIEUTENANT HILLs, to inform
Vice-ADMIRAL Collingwood of the death of NELson; on the left,
&c., &c.” It will be seen that this is upon a level with the unwritten
literature we have alluded to.
Perhaps the puff pictorial is somewhat less agreeable than the puff
verbal, and we may therefore pass over, without any very severe com-
ment, the Number 402, described as “a portrait of himself, purchased
by fifty Scottish artists, and presented by them to the Royal Academy
of Scotland.” As it required fifty artists to make the purchase of one
picture, we may presume that they all subscribed with real Scottish
liberality.
We can scarcely understand the author of the Catalogue, when he
describes Number 1207, somewhat meagrely, as an “old building at
Chelsea: painted on the spot.” Does he mean that the old building
was not removed before it was painted Of course, the old building
could not have been brought to the artist's house, who, if he painted the
structure at all, must have painted it on the spot it stood upon.
Number 1279 has been made the medium of one of the most remark-
able puffs that ever was known; for though the picture only represents
a staircase, MR. Hull AH and his system are somehow or other lugged
in over the banisters. The painting is described most unnecessarily
and lengthily, as “a staircase leading to the Music Hall for MR.
HULLAH's singing classes.” Who cares where the staircase leads to ?
It might have led to the Egyptian Hall, to Tom THUMB's levees, just
as well as to the Music Hall for MR. Hull,AH's pupils. We are sure
MR. Hull AH must regret this unnecessary suggestion of “Sich a getting
up stairs,” for himself and pupils. It is not by such advertisements
as these that one can ascend the ladder of popularity.
On the whole, we think the Catalogue about on an average with
those of past years, as a literary production. We miss some of those
beautiful snatches of poetry, which may well be called snatches, from
their seizing, wholesale, the ideas of other people, that certain painters
used to favour us with, under the signature of M.S., or anonymous.
MR. TURNER seems to have used up his “Fallacies of Hope,” which is
perhaps an advantage, as he has had none left for insertion in this
year's Catalogue. We have only to say in conclusion, that the book
will pass a quarter of an hour very pleasantly.
A VOICE FROM THE CELLAR.
THE subjoined correspondence has been handed to us. With our
customary urbanity—has it not become a proverb 2–we print it.
The first letter is from the Martyr of the Cellar, Mn. SMITH O'BRIEN,
to MADAME Tussaud. The second is that distinguished lady's answer.
“DEAREst MADAM, The Cellar, May 11, 1846.
“At the present moment, when Ireland is ringing with my
wrongs; when millions of hearts, the property of the finest peasantry
of the earth, are beating with sympathy towards their martyr; when,
at least, the same number of swords are ready (on being drawn) to flash
from their scabbards for my liberation,-it has been suggested to me by,
possibly a partial friend, that the figure of SMITH O'BRIEN, the Martyr,
would make a most attractive addition to your collection of distinguished
characters. I am not particular where you put me, so I getin. You've
had O'Connell for some time, and (but quite between ourselves) the
people have had enough of him. All Ireland (including myself) look
up to me as the sort of PRINCE of WALEs to KING DAN. You may
therefore (if you are over-crowded) turn him out, to make room for me.
“Yours, dearest Madam, with every feeling of respect,
“SMITH O'BRIEN.”
“P.S.—Ishall be happy to give you the earliest day for sitting; and
that the thing may be more complete, propose to present you with the
identical suit of clothes worn by me when taken to the Cellar.”
“SIR, Baker Street, Portman Square, May 11.
“PERMIT me to thank you for your very polite offer; but as I
contemplate the immediate addition of ToM THUMB to my Collection,
Ifear I shall be too much crowded to give you even a corner. Besides,
martyrs are, at the best, heavy subjects. I don't think people would
lay out sixpence upon ‘em. O'Connell has done pretty well forme, but
I should hardly like to riskan O'BRIEN;-in the like way that people
who are very fond of mushrooms, are most particular to avoid toadstools.
“I remain your obedient Servant, M. Tussaud.”
“P.S.—I know a man who travels with a van of wax-work. Perhaps
he may accept your offer, Shall I send him to the Cellar?"
WestminstER BRIDGE is in as dangerous a state as ever, MR. BATTY
says, the most difficult feat his horses have to accomplish is crossing
the mountainous paving that runs over the Thames, from his Circus
to the Houses of Parliament. The Alps, he declares, are nothing to it.

THE POLITICAL SERENADERS.
As matters seem to be just now rather flat in the political world, we
strongly recommend the formation of a party of Political Serenaders,
who might prove almost as attractive as the Ethiopians. The old
nigger peculiarity of wheeling about and turning about, has been
practised so long by politicians, that it has ceased to excite either
wonder or interest, and there is nothing now left but quiet meledy, of
which we have much pleasure in affording two or three specimens.
We will commence with the song of SMITH OBRIEN, which might
very well be sung to the admired air of
“JIM ALONG JOSEY.”
I'M from the House of Commons, you all must know,
Where to a Railway Committee I refused to go.
At the Saxons I did defiance fling,
And turn’d a deaf ear when I heard them sing,
Hey, come along, come along SMITHEY.
Hey, come along, come along SMITH.
Once old O'Connell was all de go,
Till he found him rival in BRIEN–SMITH O ;
Now poor old SMITH dey have put him to bed,
With the top of a cellar over him head;
Oh, Jim along, Jim along SMITHEY,
Hey, Jim along, Jim along SMITH.
That I should be a martyr, I expected soon,
But I find dey only tink me a kind of pantaloon :
I thought they'd call me a fine old feller,
But they've shov'd me down in de masty cellar.
Hey, Jim along, Jim along SMITHEY,
Hey, Jim along, Jim along SMITH.
Oh I I’m de bold O'BRIEN, dat don't mind my troubles,
Because I know they'll burst very soon, like bubbles ;
But when one's ambitious, 'tis hard you know,
To be compar'd to “the donkey what wouldn't go.”
Hey, Jim along, Jim along SMITHEY,
Hey, Jim along, Jim along SMITH.
As MR. DILLoN BRowNE seems disposed to follow SMITH O'BRIEN's
example, the latter, in his capacity of a Political Serenader, might
address to the former the following melody to the air of
“LUCY LONG.”
Again I come before you
To sing a little song,
Of one who in the cellar
Will join me p'rhaps ere long.
So take your time, my DILLoN,
My DILLoN, soon be down,
To join me in my cellar—
My DILLoN, DILLoN BRow NE.
My DILLON BRowNE is captious,
Although he is not strong;
He is so very saucy,
I’m sure he can't be long.
So take your time, my DILLoN, &c.
His head it is so empty,
His brains are soft as cotton ;
His learning pass'd from ear to ear,
And now is all forgotten.
So take your time, my DILLoN, &c.
For every information
He feels the utmost scorn,
As blessed in his ignorance
As is the babe unborn.
So take your time, my DILLON, &c.
And when he’s on Committee,
. Each step he's forced to mark;
At every step he's sure to stick,
Because he’s in the dark.
So take your time, my DILLON, &c.
They’ve asked him to a Railway,
They asked him t'other day;
YIe said he'd come, but thought they'd better
Get him to stop away.
So take your time, old fellow,
Stick to it, right or wrong,
And you'll be in the cellar
With me, my boy, ere long.
We will conclude our selection of Political Serenades with one writ-
ten to be sung by a sort of agricultural Ethiopian, formerly attached
to, but now jilted by, the PREMIER. The situation at once suggests the
delicious air of
“LUCY NEAL.”
Come all you members, old and young, and listen to my song,
I'll tell you of a sad affair, I won't detain you long.
When I did vote 'gainst sugar bills, to make old Russell wheel,
I did it for the sake of one, whose name is Robert PEEL.
Oh I clever Robert PEEL–so sharp was Robert PEEL ;
Oh! when I had him at my side, how happy I did feel !
His conduct seem’d quite handsome, his conduct seem'd quite fair;
If you could see him as he was, I'm sure you now would stare.
I had a rival in my love—the Anti-Corn-Law League:
I little thought to fight with him would cause me such fatigue.
Oh ! clever Robert PEEL–faithless Robert PEEL ;
As long as you were on my side, how happy did I feel !
I courted fickle Robert ; he sought companions new ;
And, oh! you won't believe that such a thing he'd do.
But to the League he went, because it made a rout,
And quickly in its favour he turned quite round about.
Oh 1 naughty PEEL–too bad of Robert PEEL ;
If I could have him on my side, how happy I should feel !
Soon Robert swore his innocence, and I believed all true ;
And Iforgave his fault once more, as I'd forgiven two.
I hope you’ll not make fun of us for having had some strife,
Because I’ve been accustomed to be his slave for life.
Oh! Robert PEEL–clever Robert PEEL ;
'Tis only when I'm on your side that happy I can feel.
$tſ)00ling the 3rmy.
OUR gallant troops, at the bidding of their country, are about to in-
vade a new territory, that of Learning, although Learning and the
British Army may, in one sense of the word, be said to be old foes.
Having conquered nearly everybody and everything they have hitherto
encountered, let us hope they will master the difficulties of grammar.
They never yet yielded to numbers; may they vanquish arithmetic'
We have a word or two to offer on some important changes which the
education of the Army will involve. First, what with orthography,
etymology, syntax, and prosody, also ciphering and geography, a new
set of exercises will be added to the military drill. This will necessi-
tate additional words of command; as, Carry satchels, Shoulder slates,
and Present copy-books; and regiments will be ordered to extract as
well as form squares, and not only to fall into lines, but to rule them.
Who knows but that this system, ultimately, may produce a scholastic
mode of warfare, wherein positions will be stormed, and points carried,
by demonstrations and syllogisms, instead of ball and bayonet, and
that artillery will be superseded by the canons of logic * We hope,
however, that the scholastic discipline will not include flogging, which
we shall gladly behold abolished altogether in the New School of the
Army.
FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE.
ThE Morning Post contains the following amongst its fashionable
intelligence:—
“We are informed that MoHUNFLAL entertained a distinguished party at dinner on
Wednesday evening, on which occasion his table was covered with the various splendid
. g a Cashmerian dinner—viz., shabdeg, doofaza, navangpoulow, montunjunc,
c., &c.
The above paragraph contains one fault—it forgets to inform us
what the above delicacies are. If they are only half as difficult to eat
as they are to pronounce, we pity the poor guests who were invited.
Fancy asking a lady if she would have a little “doofazal" or saying to
the host, “LAL a glass of shabdeg l’” By the bye, we hardly under-
stand what is meant by a “Cashmerian dinner.” The only notion we
have of a Cashmerian dinner, is a picnic, when the dimity has been
left behind, and the ladies are obliging enough to lay down their shawls
to make an impromptu table-cloth for the dinner.

DREADFUL GALE.
THERE was a dreadful gale in the House of Commons on Tuesday
night, when REID blew a strong north-easterly wind. We regret
to say that two or three of the small craft had their top rigging blown
away; and a number of papers and several pair of gloves were lost on
the occasion. The wig of one gallant commander, after being violently
tossed about by the contending currents, was torn to pieces, and went
down to the bottom. It was cast ashore the following morning, a fear-
ful wreck. The cruising in the channel of the house was very diffi-
cult, and very few members ventured from their moorings. Pilots who
had weathered the storm for years, quite shook before the violence of
the wind. Not an order could be heard for the roaring of the storm,
and SIR Robert PEEL's voice was quite drowned in the hurricane.
The damage, it is estimated, is very great. These gales, it seems, are
very prevalent in the House. Whenever a storm is brewing, it is not
funusual to hear a hardy weather-beaten old member say, “Hallo I
messmates, it will blow great REIDs to-night !”

T H E S N O BS OF E N G LAND.
BY ONE OF THEMSELVES,
CHAPTER XII.-ON CLERICAL SNOBS AND SNOBBISHNESS.
EAR MR. SNoB,” an amiable
young correspondent writes,
who signs himself SNOBLING,
“ought the clergyman who, at
the request of a noble Duke,
lately interrupted a marriage
ceremony between two persons
perfectly authorized to marry,
to be ranked or not among the
Clerical Snobs P’”
This, my dear young friend,
is not a fair question. One
of the illustrated weekly pa-
pers has already seized hold of
the clergyman, and blackened
him most unmercifully, by re-
presenting him in his cassock
performing the marriage ser-
vice. Let that be sufficient punishment; and, if you please, do not
press the query.
It is very likely that if Miss SMITH had come with a license to
marry Jones, the parson in question, not seeing old SMITH present,
would have sent off the beadle in a cab to let the old gentleman know
what was going on ; and would have delayed the service until the
arrival of SMITH Senior. He very likely thinks it his duty to ask all
marriageable young ladies, who come without their Papa, why their
parent is absent; and, no doubt, always sends off the beadle for that
missing governor.
Or, it is very possible that the DUKE of Coeur DELION was MR.
WHATDYEcALLUM's most intimate friend, and has often said to him,
“WHATDYECALLUM, my boy, my daughter must never marry the
Capting. If ever they try at your church, I beseech you, considering
the terms of intimacy on which we are, to send off RATTAN in a hack-
cab to fetch me.”
In either of which cases, you see, dear SNoBLING, that though the
parson would not have been authorized, yet he might have been
excused for interfering. He has no more right to stop my marriage
than to stop my dinner, to both of which, as a free-born Briton, I am
entitled by law, if I can pay for them. But, consider pastoral solici-
tude, a deep sense of the duties of his office, and pardon this incon-
venient, but genuine zeal.
But if the clergyman did in the Duke's case what he would not do
in SMITH's ; if he has no more acquaintance with the CoEURDElio N
family than I have with the Royal and Serene House of SAxe-CobURG
Goth A, then, I confess, my dear SNoBLING, your question might elicit
a disagreeable reply, and one which I respectfully decline to give. I
wonder what SIR GEoRGE TUFto would say, if a sentry left his post
because a noble lord (not in the least connected with the service)
begged the sentinel not to do his duty 2
Alas ! that the beadle who canes little boys and drives them out,
cannot drive worldliness out too ; and what is worldliness but Snob-
bishness 2 When, for instance, I read in the newspapers that the
RIGHT REVEREND THE LoRD CHARLEs JAMEs administered the rite
of confirmation to a party of the jurenile nobility at the Chapel Royal,—
as if the Chapel Royal were a sort of ecclesiastical ALMAck's, and
young people were to get ready for the next world in little exclusive
genteel knots of the aristocracy, who were not to be disturbed in their
journey thither by the company of the vulgar;-when I read such a
paragraph as that (and one or two such generally appear during the
present fashionable season), it seems to me to be the most odious,
mean, and disgusting part of that odious, mean, and disgusting pub-
lication, the Court Circular; and that Snobbishness is therein carried
to quite an awful pitch. What, gentlemen, can't we even in the
Church acknowledge a republic There, at least, the Heralds’
College itself might allow that we all of us have the same pedigree,
and are direct descendants of Eve and ADAM, whose inheritance is
divided amongst us. -
I hereby call upon all Dukes, Earls, Baronets, and other potentates,
nºt to lend themselves to this shameful scandal and error, and beseech
all Bishops, who read this publication, to take the matter into con-
sideration, and to protest against the continuance of the practice, and
to declare, “We won't confirm or christen Lord ToMNoddy, or SIR
CARNABY JENKs, to the exclusion of any other young Christian ;” the
which declaration, if their Lordships are induced to make, a great
lapis offensionis will be removed, and the Snob Papers will not have
been written in vain.
A story is current of a celebrated nouveau-riche, who having had
occasion to oblige that excellent prelate the Bishop of BULLock-
sMITHY, asked his Lordship in return, to confirm his children privately
in his Lordship's own chapel ; which ceremony the grateful prelate
accordingly performed. Can satire go farther than this 2 Is there
even in this most amusing of prints, any more naire absurdity ? It
is as if a man wouldn't go to Heaven unless he went in a special train,
or as if he thought (as some people think about vaccination) Con-
firmation more effectual when administered at first hand. When that
eminent person, the BEGUM SUMRoo, died, it is said she left ten
thousand pounds to the Pope, and ten thousand to the ARchbishop
of CANTERBURY,-so that there should be no mistake, so as to make
sure of having the ecclesiastical authorities on her side. This is only
a little more openly and undisguisedly Snobbish than the cases before
alluded to. A well-bred Snob is just as secretly proud of his riches
and honours as a parcenu Snob who makes the most ludicrous
exhibition of them ; and a high-born Marchioness or Duchess just as
vain of herself and her diamonds, as QUEEN QUASHYBoo, who sews a
pair of epaulettes on to her skirt, and turns out in state in a cocked
hat and feathers.
It is not out of disrespect to my peerage, which I love and honour,
(indeed, have I not said before, that I should be ready to jump out of
my skin if two Dukes would walk down Pall Mall with me?)—it is
not out of disrespect for the individuals, that I wish these titles had
never been invented ; but, consider, if there were no tree, there would
be no shadow ; and how much more honest society would be, and how
much more serviceable the clergy would be (which is our present con-
sideration) if these temptations of rank and continual baits of worldli-
ness were not in existence, and perpetually thrown out to lead them
astray.
I have seen many examples of their falling away. When, for
instance, Tom SNIFFLE first went into the country as Curate for MR.
FUDDLEston E, (SIR HUDDLEstone FUDDLEstone's brother,) who re-
sided on some other living, there could not be a more kind, hard-
working, and excellent creature, than ToM. He had his aunt to live
with him. His conduct to his poor was admirable. He wrote annu-
ally reams of the best-intentioned and most vapid sermons. When
LoRD BRANDYBALL's family first came down into the country, and
invited him to dine at Brandyball Park, SNIFFLE was so agitated that
he almost forgot how to say Grace, and upset a bowl of currant-jelly
sauce in LADY FANNY Toffy's lap.
What was the consequence of his intimacy with that noble family
He quarrelled with his aunt for dining out every night. The wretch
forgot his poor altogether, and killed his old nag by always riding
over to Brandyball ; where he revelled in the maddest passion for
LADY FANNY. He ordered the neatest new clothes and ecclesiastical
waistcoats from London ; he appeared with corazza-shirts, lackered
boots, and perfumery; he bought a blood-horse from Bob Torry; was
seen at archery meetings, public breakfasts, actually at cover; and,
I blush to say, that I saw him in a stall at the Opera; and afterwards
riding by LADY FANNY's side in Rotten Row. He double-barrelled his
name, (as many poor Snobs do) and instead of T. SNIFFLE, as formerly,
came out, in a porcelain card, as Rev. T. D'ARcy SNIFFLE, Burlington
Hotel.
The end of all this may be imagined : when the EARL of BRANDY-
BALL was made acquainted with the Curate's love for LADY FANNY,
he had that fit of the gout which so nearly carried him off (to the
inexpressible grief of his son, Lord ALIcompayNE), and uttered that
remarkable speech to SNIFFLE, which disposed of the claims of the
latter :—“If I didn't respect the Church, Sir,” his Lordship said, “by
Jove, I'd kick you down stairs :” his Lordship then fell back into the
fit aforesaid, and LADY FANNY, as we all know, married GENERAL
Pod AGER.
As for poor ToM, he was over head and ears in debt, as well as in
love : his creditors came down upon him. MR. HEMP, of Portugal
Street, proclaimed his name lately as a reverend outlaw ; and he has
been seen at various foreign watering-places ; sometimes doing duty;
sometimes “coaching” a stray gentleman's son at Carlsruhe or
Kissingen ; sometimes—must we say it 2—lurking about the roulette-
tables with a tuft to his chin.
If temptation had not come upon this unhappy fellow in the shape
of a LoRD BRANDY BALL, he might still have been following his pro-
fession, humbly and worthily. He might have married his cousin

with four thousand pounds, the wine-merchant's daughter, (the old

“LET us speak of A MAN As we find HIM.”
NICHOLAS'S WIFE IN ITALY.
TAKE heart, poor milliner girls 1 and, though poorly paid, and sadly
overworked, thank Heaven you are not the EMPREss of Russia.
Though you are fagged, you are not dehumanized by adulation—you
are not flattered into insanity—you are not made one fester of human
pride by the abasement and adoration of millions. The hearts in your
bosoms are not petrified by imperial blood; they may yet bound with
kindly impulses; they may yet thrill with a sympathy that the wife
of Nichol.As—poor victim of state —can never know. Late accounts
from Italy present a sad picture of the unfortunate woman. It appears
that she is very sick—but not nearly so sick as arrogant. Could pride
have killed her, she would have died long ago—every one of her nine
lives been rendered up.
It seems that the KING OF NAPLEs has beggared himself for a year
or two, to do the handsome thing for his Russian guest; and she did
little other than turn the poor man out of his own house.
“On the first day of her arrival, the Empress sent her chamberlain to invite the KING
and Queen of Naples to dine with her in his own dining-room, which meant—“to:
morrow I shall dine alone.' The poor King of NAPLEs understood it immediately, and
was in great trouble to know where he should dine with his family, or receive his court.”
And these are the folks who—according to the tribe of JENRINS-are
the patent manner-mongers for the rest of mankind
At Florence, she refused to take the arm of her host, the Grand
Duke, and took that of the Russian Admiral. It is said that in one of
her letters to the Emperor, she wrote—
“Since our marriage I have never asked you a favour, but now I have a request to
make, which I hope you will not refuse, since it is of consequence to my health, and proba-
bly my life may depend upon it—make me a present of Sicily; "-
—with Etna to boil the royal tea-kettle ! What a pity that the Em-
peror could not, by a ukase, give her the man in the moon as a little
flunkey ! Still, we have some compassion for the Empress. She is the
wife of Nicholas, and that may account for much. Nevertheless,
milliners, Punch says, again and again—Thank Heaven you are not the
EMPREss of Russia. Surely, it is better to feel want and oppression,
than to be educated out of the feeling of all human sympathy.
A BACCHANALIAN SONG.
(DEDICATED to FATHER MATHEw.)
To be adapted and sung to the tune of “ Hunting the Hare,” with accompa-
niments by the drum and Pandean pipes.
Toss your tipple off, roystering jolly boys,
Fill the tumbler, and empty the go ;
Ne'er the consequence heed of your folly, boys—
Beggary, ruin, diseases and wo,
Delirium tremens, and Gout, and Dyspepsia,
Febris and Icterus, Phthisis, Decline,
Marasmus and Megrims, confirmed Epilepsia, L
But pass round the bottle and drink up your wine.
Erysipelas, Elephantiasis,
Don't regard, my good fellows, a fig;
Impetigo, Lichen, Psoriasis,
Though they may lurk in each draught that you swig.
Eczema, Lepra, and all the variety
Of Acne that WILLAN's Nosology shows,
Shall never make us, lads, avoid inebriety,
Why, what if I do spoil the look of my nose ?
Haematemesis, Hydrops, and Tetanus,
Though we shall probably have them some day,
Ne'er let us mind, whilst as yet they but threaten us, -
Let us be merry, and drink whilst we may.
Come Apoplexia, Mania, Paralysis
Of these and all other complaints we'll make light ;
And, happy and jovial as kings in their palaces,
Though we suffer to-morrow, get tipsy to-night.
LIBEL ON HER MAJESTY.
WE have to call the attention of the ATToRNEY-GENERAL to a para-
graph in the Berkshire Chronicle, telling us “that it is in contemplation
to close the Royal apartments at the Castle to the Public altogether.”
We have, we hope, a fraternal feeling towards our fellow-labourers of
the press ; but really these wicked and malicious attacks on the
character of HER MAJESTY do call for signal punishment. We would
therefore sentence the writer of the libel to at least a month's exposure
on the Terrace, with his offence placarded on his breast, and a copy of
the Berkshire Chronicle, shaped into a fool's cap, on his wickedly inven-
tive head. On his back should be written—“THE TRAITOR who
LIBELs His QUEEN.”
JENKINS COME AGAIN.
THERE can be no doubt of it. The ghost of JENRINs haunts the Post;
and is fast becoming all his former self. Let the reader judge. The
ghost says, on the first night of I Lombardi:-
“Early as it was, the theatre was filled with the most august, illustrious, and noble
were present, wearing the blue ribbon, in compliment to that matchless rendezvous ºf
refinement and courtesy.”

PUNCH*S PORTRAIT OF THE WINNER OF THE DER BY.

Last year we created a very considerable sensation in the sporting world, by prophesying
the name of the Winner of the Derby. It so happened, that in consequence of a con-
spiracy on the turf, or a piece of orange-peel on the grass, our prediction of last year was not
verified. Being determined, on the present occasion, to get upon what is technically called
the “right horse,” we had serious thoughts of postponing our prophecy until after the race,
which would put our accuracy out of the power of the machinations of our enemies. This,
however, would lay open our pen to the imputation of “showing the white feather,” an
a bold prediction, founded on a consultation of several hieroglyphics, and a chart of the stars.
Finding, however, some little difficulty in reading the Book of Nature, in consequence of the
multiplicity of the leaves, we have thrown upon our artist the greater part of the responsibility
of prophesying the Winner of the Derby, by asking him to draw upon his imagination—that
is, a block of wood—the exact portrait of the Winner of the Derby. The above spirited illustra-
tion (which has been for some time in the hands of our engraver) is the result ; and as we
shall not be guilty of the indelicacy of mentioning names, we shall content ourselves with
describing some of the main features of the animal whose success for the Derby is the subject
of our pictorial prophecy. The victorious brute will display a firmness of fetlock and a
height of hoof that are quite unusual, while the arch of the neck, the wink of the eye, the
cocking up of the ear, and the wagging of the tail will be conspicuous in the winning animal.
Any person making up a book in accordance with these hints, will be sure of clearing a
pretty little property. Any individual disposed to speculate, should take this number of
Punch to Epsom on the Derby Day, and compare our portrait of the winner very carefully
with each of the competing quadrupeds. The one which our picture most resembles is the
right brute to bet upon. As it is likely that there will be several prophecies for the Derby
between this and the coming off of the race, we have only to say that no prediction is
genuine, unless it has the right stamp, and is signed
33&#2&#.
POLITICAL PHOTOGRAPHY.
IN an article on this subject, in a recent number of Punck, we did some injustice to the
photographic process by accusing it of hardening the lines and needlessly blackening the
character of the human countenance. It is only an act of justice to MR. BEARD to state,
that by some understanding with the sun, he has succeeded in causing that luminary to
render its fiercest rays as “mild as the moon-beams” in the process of photographic por-
traiture. . Before the art was brought to perfection, the face was ploughed up into furrows
and fearfully slashed by the Daguerreotype, while the cheeks presented as many lines as
might have been seen traced on a map of projected railways during the recent mania. MR.

amount of lead his sitters may be internally troubled with, none is now visible in their visages.

POETICAL FISHMONGERS.
WE have lately observed a disposition among
Fishmongers to court the muses, and to grace
the advertising columns of the papers with
poetical effusions in praise of the various mem-
bers of the finny tribe. We have remarked, how-
ever, that the intention is much better than
the execution; for the poems are seldom more
than four lines long, and are usually sadly defi-
cient in sentiment. To remedy this defect in
what may, without offence, be termed the poetry
of Billingsgate, we have much pleasure in offer-
ing the following specimen of a-
SONG OF THE FISHMONGER.
How beautiful at early dawn
To seek the river's marge,
And see the oyster, shrimp, and prawn,
Brought inwards by the barge.
Dut oh, 'tis sweeter far to see
The salmon, plump and round,
Which can be bought to-day of me
At sixteen-pence the pound ;
How an inevitable fate
All destiny controls |
Look at that most delicious skate—
Look at those splendid soles;
But yesterday they ranged the deep,
Devoid of thought or care,
While now, the finest in the heap,
Are two-and-six the pair.
Washhouses for Parliament.
It is, we understand, in contemplation to
move for a vote of public money for the esta-
blishment of washhouses for the especial use
of Members of Parliament; the dirt that some
of them throw at each other, during debate,
rendering them very filthy indeed. A large
supply of yellow soap, with very rough towels,
will be constantly on hand for Messrs. Roebuck
and DISRAELI.

230 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“Now THEN, SIR, JUMP. Up on THE Roof, AND Look sharp, PLEASE, SIR; HERE's T'oth ER
Bus A-coming.”
PUNCH*S POLITICAL DICTIONARY.
INCLosure. A term generally applied to the inclosing of commons. The most recent case of an inclo-
sure of any part of the Commons, is the shutting up of MASTER SMITH O'BRIEN in the cellar of the House
for being refractory. It is conjectured that the commons of England amount to about eight million
acres. These are distinct from the Commons belonging to Parliament, which comprise about five hundred
wiseacres, and are called the Collective Wisdom of the country.
INFANTICIDE. One of the most ordinary fruits of the New Poor-law.
INNs of Court. Places where students for the bar are compelled to eat a certain number of dinners
—a custom which renders the term Inns perfectly appropriate. A traveller in pursuit of the legal profes-
sion has only to put up at one of these Inns, and pay the somewhat heavy bill he must incur, and he
will be forwarded to the end of his journey. - -
INsolve NT. From in, not ; and solrere to dissolve, which form together the word insolvent; namely,
a debtor who cannot, or will not liquidate. The worst insolvent is he of whom the most has been
recorded to his credit.
INTEstACY. Dying without a will. Some people never have a will of their own until after their death,
and have therefore been intestate all their lives ; though upon their demise it is otherwise. The song-
writer who said,
“My heart's my own, my will is free,”
evidently knew nothing of law; for though his heart might be his own, his will could not be free, as wills
are always subject to the probate duty.
JAcoBINs. The name of a faction in France, which advocated freedom and committed murder with
equal liberality. The happiness of the human race was the great object of these patriots, who
attempted to facilitate the felicity of their fellow-creatures, by sending them to “another and a better
world,” with the utmost rapidity.
Journals of THE LoRDs AND CoMMONs. The log-book of the vessel of the State, in which it is
shown how frequently the Constitution has got upon a rock, and been happily shoved off again, by some
political pilot, who has weathered the storm successfully.
JURY. An assembly of twelve honest men, appointed to decide on disputes among their fellow-subjects.
As the honest men are liable to be locked up without food or candle, when they cannot agree, it is some-
times customary to toss up or play at odd man, in order to arrive at a verdict. When the jury quarrel
among themselves, it is usual to deprive them of coals, which, if given, would only be adding fuel to fire.
Juries are of very ancient origin; but, in the present day, they are divided into two kinds—Grand and
Petty. In order to prevent the latter from being actuated by petty feelings, they are liable to be chal-
enged by either party. This challenging consists of calling them out of the box, when there is no chance
of their giving satisfaction. Juries
are empannelled, and challenging
them all is called going through the
pannel; but as going through the
pannel might open the door to
injustice, no one but the Sovereign
is allowed to object to more than
thirty-five, without assigning a good
reason.
The
UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS.
SoME reports recently published
prove the pitiable want of attrac-
tion of the Lectures at Oxford and
Cambridge. The learned Professors
are serving out science to select
parties of six, or even four; and in
some few instances the classes
have dwindled down to one solitary
student: so that a species of tete-
a-tête lecturing is now prevalent in
our two great seats of Learning.
Occasionally, where attendants and
demonstrators are required, the per-
formers—if we may so call them—
are more numerous than the audi-
ence: a state of things which may
be said to have its advantages, for
it enables the lecturers to preserve
discipline, and prevent insubordi-
nation among the students. We
remember hearing of a similar case
in a theatre, where the company
on the stage exceeded the number
of the company before the curtain;
and some disapprobation having
been expressed, the actors, deter-
mined not to be hissed by a weak
minority, walked into the front of
the house, and fairly thrashed the
audience. It was held, and perhaps
justly, that so small a number had
no right to be dissatisfied, and that
the lesser ought to be overruled by
the greater number.
It is really a pitiable thing that
so much learning should have to
waste its dryness on the desert air
of an unfrequented lecture-room.
Some attraction ought immediately
to be devised for the purpose of
giving the various Professors the
benefit of a large attendance. We
would propose that GENERAL ToM
Thumb should be engaged to illus-
trate the course of Modern History
by his faithful representations of
NAPOLEoN, the DUKE of WEL-
LINGToN, and other great modern
characters. PROFEssoR KELLER
might also be secured, to show by
his poses plastiques the various posi-
tions in which many of the heroes
of antiquity placed themselves. A
lecture on chemistry would begreatly
relieved by a good Clown, who would
not object to drink off the various
mixtures prepared by the Professor,
and enliven the intervals by some
scientific jokes, which we should be
happy to provide for all the classes,
if we were honoured with the ap-
pointment of Joe-MILLERIAN Pro-
fessor to the whole University.
IMPROVEMENTs of THE METROPolis.
IMMENSE boards have been put
up on each side of Westminster
Bridge, to prevent the omnibuses
falling into the river.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OPERATIC DEBATES.
UR contemporary, the Times, observing the
recent tendency of several members of
Parliament to introduce songs into their
speeches, has suggested “the substitution
of operatic for elocutionary perform-
ances,” by way of enlivening the dull
monotony of the debates in the House of.
Commons. We think the notion an ex-
ceedingly happy one, and in order that
the public may judge of the effect of
the carrying out of the project, we have
taken, as a plot, a debate on the Corn
Laws, and thrown it into a
BALLAD OPERA.
The stage represents the House of Commons, only partially occupied, with
| Members and Officers. The SPEAKER is in the chair, and the curtain
rises to the symphony of the following |
|
CHORUS.
Alas ! how sad is the Member's fate 1
Another long night of dull debate. -
But as long as some one will talking keep,
What matter ? The Member can go to sleep.
Then, hurrah for the speeches, heavy as lead;
They're almost as good as a downy bed. -
Usher, Usher in you we confide;
Wake us up in time to divide.
Borthwick commences. all is right;
Slumber comes o'er us. Good night, good night !
All's well! Good night !
[The various Members who have been joining in the chorus, fall off to
sleep, and the symphony dies away in the distance. Through the
last few bars of it the voice of BoBTHwick is heard murmuring
the following sentences:—
Alas! my unhappy country; thou hast lost thy confidence in public
men; the principles they have been advocating for thirty years, are
scattered to the winds, like the leaves of autumn. Oh I those leaves of
| autumn, how they rustle around me, like the scattered fragments of
broken hopes, which we never can collect again.
BALLAD
Oh how the memory of the past
The human spirit grieves,
To see past pledges idly cast
Away like autumn leaves |
In vain the bosom glows with fires
Of patriotic flame ;
To see their sons, our English sires
Would blush with honest shame.
The once illustrious British Oak
Is shaken by the gale;
The British Lion is a joke—
He wags in vain his tail.
No word by statesmen spoken now,
The hearer e'er believes ;
Broken is every former vow,
Scatter'd like autumn leaves.
Sir James Graham. Well, well, 'tis idle now commenting o'er the past.
Believe me, MASTER Borthwick, there is more courage in acknowledg-
ing an error than in sticking to it. I'm an old sailor, look you, MAstER
| Borthwick; a regular tar for all weathers; and it's only by sailing
with the wind that we can succeed in weathering the storm.
SONG AND HORNPIPE.
My name's fickle JEM, do you see,
In my cap I don't care for fine feathers ;
My pride it is always to be,
The regular tar for all weathers.
If a breeze rises up in the west,
Before it I'm ready to sail,
Because it is certainly best
To go with the strength of the gale.
Sing hey, sing ho,
Blow high, blow low,
I'm the regular tar for all weathers.
Mr. Miles. Oh it’s all very well; but the same breeze which blows
you into harbour, MAstER JEM, gives a sad blow to the British Oak,
under which our Glorious Constitution has been sheltered for many a
long century.
Sir James Graham. Pooh MASTER MILEs, the British Oak is a
mere oaks.
Mr. Miles. I hate such heartless ribaldry. It falls upon mine ear
like the knell of the Constitution. You may sneer as you will at the
British Oak, but I wish you would act like the woodman in the ballad,
and spare that tree.
(He recites, with much emotion, to a sort of recitative accompaniment)
Woodman, spare that tree,
I honour every bough;
In youth it sheltered me,
And I’ll protect it now.
[Members wake up on all sides during the preceding recitative, and at
its conclusion burst into the following finale.
CHORUS.
Those drowsy murmurs, gently gliding
Through the House from right to left,
Now remind us of dividing—
Of patience we are quite bereft.
Then raise, from side to side,
The shout, “Divide, divide l’”
CHORUS OF PROTECTIONISTS.
To have our way, 'tis now our turn ;
We won't divide—adjourn, adjourn.
RECITATIVE.--THE SPEARER.
These noisy shouts on wild confusion border:
Say, shall I put the question ? Order, order 1
The wishes of the House, pray, let me learn.
CHORUS or FREE-TRADERS.
Let us divide.
CHORUS OF PROTECTIONISTS.
No.! no let us adjourn.
GENERAL CHORUS.
Free Traders. Confusion, delusion,
On every side;
'Tis bootless and fruitless—
Divide, divide
Protectionists. While ruin is brewin'
With rage we burn;
Our will now, is still now,
Adjourn adjourn
[In the general confusion the SPEARER intimates, by his gestures, that
the Ayes have it, and the House adjourns.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
As the period for the Waterloo Banquet is soon coming round, our
attention is naturally drawn to the painting of that great annual feast,
which has recently been exhibited by the light of the celebrated Moon
of Threadneedle Street, to the public in general. With his usual
felicity, Moon, the soi-disant patron of the Fine Arts, has contrived to
mix himself up with the Battle of Waterloo, and he will go down to
posterity with a napkin in his hand, as a waiter, in the celebrated
engraving of the banquet. Whether Moon was really on the field of
battle, may be doubtful; but it is not improbable that the scene was
visited at night by his celestial prototype, and this is quite sufficient
to give the Treadneedle Street luminary a pretext for introducing his
own benignant countenance.
In looking at the picture itself we are struck by the ingenuity of the
artist, in contriving to turn the faces of all the guests into such positions
as will admit of their portraits being fairly exhibited. It is true that
the Waterloo Banquet must be one of the most uncomfortable sets out
that ever was given, if the guests are compelled to assume the attitudes
shown in the picture; but the necessity for showing the likenesses
| accounts for the odd postures into which the various heroes have been

back his neck to an extent that would certainly break off his head, if
the evolution were really attempted ; while another military chieftain
has screwed his throat so completely the wrong way, that nothing
short of a most elastic condition of the jugular muscles would enable
him to accomplish the contortion.
Instead of Waterloo heroes, the veterans, by their difficult achieve-
ments in the way of posturising appear to be worthy rivals of the
Egyptian Brothers, the Bedouin Stepfathers, or the Macintosh Macedo-
nians. PROFEssoR RIsLEY and his Sons are positively stiff and
inflexible when compared with the very supple state of the MARQUIs of
ANGLESEA and his aide-de-camps, as they appearin the Waterloo Banquet.
If this picture really bears astrong resemblance to the original, as we have
been led to believe it does, we can only regret the rudeness which causes
so many of the Waterloo heroes to turn their backs upon the DURE of
WELLINGTON, while he is evidently in the act of proposing a toast to
the company.
While the “hero of a hundred fights” is upon his legs, it is clear that
several of his fellow-heroes are chatting together, without paying the
smallest attention to their leader's eloquence. We hope they will
have learnt better manners in time for the next celebration of the
anniversary of Waterloo.

A VISIT TO THE MARTYR BY THE '82 CLUB.
“Green to the green.”
DEPUTATION of the members of
the '82 Club has visited Martyr

Irish spirits. We blush, how-
ever, for the levity of some of
our contemporaries, who have
treated the affecting incident—
an incident to be some day fres.
coed on the walls of an Irish
House of Parliament—with a
ridicule approaching the heart-
less. They have sneered at the
Martyr as a theatrical Jupiter
Tomans: for all the world as if
his terrible thunder-bolts were
of no heavier metal than block-
tin. They have (for purposes
best known to themselves) pub-
lished a garbled account of the
eloquence that, like SHARs-
PEARE's and Jonson's wit at
the Devil Tavern, has left a
spirit in the very walls of the
cellar. Being desirous of setting
the Martyr right with an impatient and sympathising world, we
applied to the heroic sufferer himself, who, with an urbanity second
only to his patriotism, has favoured us with the true account of the
proceedings. With an inexpressible emotion of pride we subjoin it —
“Yesterday a deputation of the glorious and invincible '82 Club
waited upon the Irish Martyr in his Saxon dungeon. The Martyr
was seated on a turned-up kilderkin, immersed in the wrongs of his
country. In his right hand he held a toothpick, by means of which
he had just inscribed on his dungeon wall—
* Hereditary bondsmen, know ye not.—
&c., &c., &c., &c. 2"
- sº
:
W
“At his feet lay a pewter-pot, on which he had engraved the monster-
meeting on the Hill of Tara. It may be remembered that BARoN
TRENCR occupied his captive hours in a somewhat similar manner ;
his cups at the present time bearing a high price in Prussia. Need
we hint the belief that the Martyr's pewter-pots will be bought up at
any sum by the men of Limerick 2 However, to the deputation. No
sooner did the sample half-dozen find themselves in the cellar, than
they all sought to rush into the arms of the Martyr. Alas ! his heart,
like an omnibus, would hold any number, but he could only take to
his arms one at a time. The deputation felt themselves as much
moved as possible in so small a place. Some of them clenched their
fists, and, with heaving breasts, and eyes smouldering with latent fire,
indignantly surveyed the walls of the cell. They spoke no word;
but it was evident that they all internally exclaimed — ‘What
a cell !’
At length one of the six, wiping his eyes and using his handker-
chief, proceeded to read the address —
“To William Smith O'Brien, Esq., M.P.
“‘BELovED MARTYR,-We, the most verdant specimens of the Green
Isle, your brethren of the '82, have to address you in feelings of inex-
pressible delight and sympathy, on seeing you incarcerated in the
prison of the Saxon. Oh! is it not a heart-cheering sight to behold
you here, the defying victim of a tyrant Legislature ? We have con-
templated-deeply contemplated—the condition of a REGULUs inside a
barrel of spikes. But how poor, how little, how very small-beerish
the comparison of a REGULUs in a kilderkin, for the sake of barbarian
Rome, to a WILLIAM SMITH O'BRIEN, Esq., M.P., on a kilderkin, for
dispassionate, enlightened, and all too meek and gentle Ireland " Oh, in
thinking of your great descent, and seeing you here in this ignominious
cellar—(only that the lustre of your virtues gives a gas-light radiance
tº its gloom)—the imagination reverts to the picture of the poet, and
the tongue is forced to exclaim, whether it will or no, -
‘May wenot trace the noble dust of William Smith O'BRIEN, Esq., M.P. >
Till we find it stopping a bung-hole?”
“‘Your country, sir, feels for your martyrdom, and whilst she weeps
over it, glories in it. She feels for your sufferings, your privations,
and is resolved to mark her sympathy by abstinence and self-mortifi-
cation. Until SMITH O'Brien is free from the manacle of the Saxon,
the '82 Club have registered a vow to drink claret only of an inferior
yintage, to eschew venison, confining themselves to penitential
haunch of mutton ; and, further, if they take soup at all, touchingly
and significantly to illustrate their feelings, by entirely abstaining from
real turtle, and enjoying only the mock
“‘And think not, illustrious Martyr, your countrywomen are indiffe-
rent to your claims. The brightest diamonds in the crown of the
Saxon—(if, indeed, they are diamonds and not paste, the only real
thing in it being the emerald stolen from Ireland)—its brightest
diamonds, or paste, are dim and worthless as pewter to the tears that
have gemmed the eyes of your countrywomen, thinking of your
wrongs. But your name, magnanimous martyr, has hymned their
infants to sleep, your name is inscribed not only on the hearts, but on
the hearth-stones of the daughters of Erin
“‘Illustrious sufferer—no, perish the word —rejoicing Martyr, your
countrywomen, by us, have a supplication to make. They pray for—
a lock of your hair Whether that lock, divided into threads, will be
made to mark their pocket-handkerchiefs—whether, like the Danish
raven, it will be worked in a national banner “to flout the sky”
against the Saxon—or, a fireside memento, be worked into kettle-
holders—it is not for us precipitately to anticipate. Kettle-holders,
from their frequent connection with hot water, might possibly be
thought the better vehicle. º
“‘Glorious Martyr —we congratulate you that you are here. Sur-
veying your dungeon, it is with swelling hearts we feel that you have
won it well, and, for the glory of Ireland, may you keep it long !”
“‘(Signed)
“‘&c., &c.”
“The Martyr then proceeded to read an answer to the address. “I
am proud (he said) of these walls : prouder of them than of the tapes-
tried chambers of kings. (Great sensation.) I am resolved to add
another to the list of Martyrs for Old Ireland. It is not for me in this
place, at this time, to speak of my sufferings. It is not for me to
inform you that I am particularly fond of Burgundy ; but, out of
hatred to the dastardly Saxon, have confined myself to Port l My
favourite bit of chicken is the merry-thought. But, I ask it—is this
a place for the enjoyment of merry thoughts, when my country is
bleeding 2 No. Here, all I wish to take is wings. I own it; I am
madly fond of a fine Havannah. But, in the vault of the Saxon, I
scorn to take aught beyond a penny Cuba | (Another sensation.) I
glory in my privations; but I am too proud to speak of them. Other-
wise, I might tell you—and through you tell shuddering Ireland—that
I have renounced the common luxury of a boot-jack; and in lieu of
that most domestic instrument, every night make use of the rail of a
chair I (Here some of the deputation wept.)
“‘My countrywomen ask a lock of my hair. Had they asked my
head they should have had it ; for I would gladly lay my head in the
lap of my country. (Here the Martyr, taking up a table-knife, cut off

the SAMPson of Erin. Here, until my country is righted, will I

may repose upon the strength of her Martyr.
“‘And, brethren, fear not. When the time shall come, the Irish
SAMPson will be more than a match for the Saxon ; and, further,
fear not, while I live and speak, that, like SAMPson, I shall ever want
a weapon for the annihilation of the Philistines.’
“Here the Martyr's hair was ceremoniously tied up with a bunch of
green ribbons, and put in the breast-pocket—“nearest his heart'—of
one of the deputation. Mutual embraces again took place, and the
deputation withdrew. Whereupon, the Martyr again turned his face
to the wall, and with his toothpick proceeded to inscribe —‘First
flower of the earth, and first gem of the sea.’”

A PRACTICE has lately sprung up among advertisers, of sending out
persons “made up” in such a style as to represent the article it is
intended to advertise. We have seen a series of men converted into
gigantic hats, and we have observed other contrivances of equal inge-
nuity. We think, however, the principle might be still further carried
out, in a manner that would combine wondrous effect with startling
novelty. In advertising a pill, for instance, what could be more striking
than a human being rolling along the street in the shape of a tremen-
dous bolus * : Or in advertising a boot-jack, could anything be better
than to send an individual into the Strand, folded up, or made out into
the form of that most useful implement * The “gentleman's real head
of hair,” might also be placed on castors, with a boy inside the wig, and
it could thus perambulate the streets with a certainty of acquiring
ADVERTISERS.
that notoriety which is the acknowledged object of all advertisements.
We saw, a day or two ago, in the Strand, a number of individuals
“got up” in the conventional clothing of British tars, with belts round
their waists, to save them from drowning, and carrying huge placards,
announcing some contrivance that was to be purchased somewhere of
somebody. This was all very well, but it struck us that it would have
been much more effective if the bearers of the placards had been float-
ing about the Thames, with their bill-boards raised above them to act
as sails, while the belts, by keeping their wearers above water, would
give ocular demonstration of the value of the principle.
In making this suggestion, we hope to get rid of the monster-vans
and other advertising nuisances, which are so very objectionable in the
streets of the Metropolis.

wafer with a delicate finger. . His last-made book is called Anecdotes
of Dogs; a very pretty book, worthy of the proverbial magnificence
and taste of his publisher. Now, Punch has a deep affection for Dogs;
indeed, so large a love for them, that there are a few statues—yea, even
royal ones—in London, that Punch, could he have his will, would
take down; elevating to their pedestals the rera effigies of some Dog of
great moral beauty, some Dog of incorruptible fidelity, some Dog of
mingled benevolence and sagacity. We could get all these Dogs from
the pages of Jesse : but the Dog of Dogs is JEsse's Irish Wolf-dog.
What a nose has he for the descendants of the Irish Kings . Let the
following veracious story, chronicled by the guileless Jesse, attest the
loyalty of the Irish bow-wow !—
“A gentleman of an ancient family, whose name it is unnecessary to mention, from
his having been engaged in the troubles which agitated Ireland about forty years since,
went into a coffee-room at Dublin, during that period, accompanied by a noble wolf-dog,
supposed to be one of the last of the breed. ere was only one other gentleman in the
coffee-room, who, on seeing the dog, went up to him, and began to notice him. The
owner, in considerable alarm, begged him to desist, as the dog was fierce, and would
never allow a stranger to touch him. The gentleman resumed his seat, when the dog
came to him, showed the greatest pleasure at being noticed, and allowed himself to be
..ſondled. His owner could not disguise his astonishment. “You are the only person,"
he said, “whom that dog would ever allow to touch him without showing resentment.
May I beg the favour of you to tell me yourname?'—mentioning his own at the same time.
The stranger announced it (he was the last of his race, one of the most ancient and noble
in Ireland, and descended F.Roni onk of its kings). “I do not wonder,’ said the owner
of the dog, “at the homage this animal has paid you. He recognises in you the descendant
of one of our most ancient race of gentlemen to whom this breed of dogs almost exclusively
belonged, and the peculiar instinct he possesses has now been shown in a manner which
cannot be mistaken by me, who am so well acquainted with the ferocity this dog has hither-
to shown to all strangers.’”
There, reader, if you can swallow that, you can of course bolt the
whole Book of Jesse without wincing. Punch, however, must ask one

the Irish wolf-dog be the dog that JEsse avouches, we can only say
that no Heralds' College “is complete without him.”

high estimation in which English music is held at the Palace; for is

THE AMERICAN EAGLE.
(Aquila Repudiatrix, LINN. Aigle Coquin, BUFF)
His unclean bird of the ancients,
though classed among the Eagles,
seems in its aspect and peculiarities
rather to resemble the Vulture tribe.
It must not, however, be confounded
with the “King Vulture” of BEwick,
as it is a republican bird. It is dis-
tinguished from all others by being
curiously marked with stripes and
stars. Its flight resembles that of the
Kite. Its voracity is something tre-
mendous ; it preys chiefly on the
Oregon racoon, the Texas opossum,
and the green snake of California;
but it is also extremely fatal to the
large species of goose called the
Creditor, (Anser Ectraordinarius,
LINN. ; Joli Marin, BUFF.,) which it
decoys into accompanying it to its own haunts by an affectation of
honest friendship, apparently finding means to persuade the foolish
bird that more ample supplies and thorough security will be found there:
the unfortunate goose, thus entrapped, is then at once despatched by
its ruthless betrayer.
It is one peculiarity of this Eagle, that he invariably performs the
operation of plucking his victim, which he does as neatly as the most
accomplished cook. This process has been admirably described by that
excellent Natural Historian, the late REv. SYDNEY SMITH, who was an
eye-witness of the capture and plucking of several Creditor Geese by
the American Eagle, in the manner explained, somewhere in the State
of Pennsylvania.
The Eagle is also partial to the flesh of negroes, which it will
seize with evident gusto. A singular antipathy is evinced by this
bird to that noble animal, the British Lion (Leo Verus Caeruleus,
LINN. ; Lion Bonhomme, BUFF.), whom, in spite of his strength and
courage, it even contrives occasionally to dislodge from his own
hunting-grounds, in Oregon, and elsewhere. This is performed by a
number of the Eagles building their unpleasant nests in his neighbour-
hood, by which the Lion is gradually driven further and further off,
till at length he finds himself deprived of the whole of his accustomed
haunt, merely by this “masterly inactivity” on the part of his inferior
opponent. American naturalists affirm that the Eagle is constantly
seen to “whip the British Lion,” though how this can be performed
it seems impossible to explain, and the statement is commonly classed
with the majority of American assertions.
A sort of alliance has been remarked to exist between the Eagle and
the Gallic Cock (Gallus tolerabilis bonus, LINN.; Coq assez-respectable,
BUFF.), owing, probably, to their sharing in the antipathy to the
British animal; but this is a strange and unnatural alliance, for the
gallant Cock, with all his faults, is a much more valuable bird.
Many eminent naturalists, who have watched the American species
now under discussion, are of opinion that the race is becoming
deteriorated, and losing some high distinctions which it undoubtedly
possessed ; the colours grow dimmer ; and it is expected that (if the
deterioration continues) the stars which adorn the wing of the bird
will be all extinguished : the stripes on the back, however, are likely
to be greatly multiplied.

THE SNOBS OF ENGLAND.
BY ONE OF THEMSELVEs.
CHAP. XIII.-ON CLERICAL SNOBS.
AMoNG the varieties of the Snob Clerical, the University Snob and
the Scholastic Snob ought never to be forgotten ; they form a very
strong battalion in the black-coated army.
The wisdom of our ancestors (which I admire more and more every
day) seemed to have determined that the education of youth was so
paltry and unimportant a matter, that almost any man, armed with a
birch and a regulation cassock and degree, might undertake the charge;
and many an honest country gentleman may be found to the present
day, who takes very good care to have a character with his butler
when he engages him, and will not purchase a horse without the
strongest warranty and the closest inspection ; but sends off his son,
young John THOMAs, to school without asking any questions about
the Schoolmaster, and places the lad at Switchester College, under
Doctor Block, because he (the good old English gentleman) had been
at Switchester, under Doctor Buzwig, forty years ago.
We have a love for all little boys at school; for many scores of
thousands of them read and love Punch:—may he never write a word
that shall not be honest and fit for them to read . He will not have
his young friends to be Snobs in the future, or to be bullied by Snobs,
or given over to such to be educated. Our connexion with the youth
at the Universities is very close and affectionate. The candid under-
graduate is our friend. The pompous old College DoN trembles in his
common room, lest we should attack him and show him up as a Snob,
When Railroads were threatening to invade the land which they
have since conquered, it may be recollected what a shrieking and out-
cry the authorities of Oxford and Eton made, lest the iron abominations
should come near those seats of pure learning, and tempt the British
youth astray. The supplications were in vain ; the railroad is in
upon them, and the Old-World institutions are doomed. I felt charmed to
read in the papers the other day a most veracious puffing advertisement,
headed, “To College AND BACK FoR FIVE SHILLINGs.” “The College
Gardens (it said) will be thrown open on this occasion"; the College
youths will perform a regatta ; the Chapel of King's College will have
its celebrated music ;”—and all for five shillings . The Goths have got
into Rome; NApoleoN STEPHENson draws his republican lines round
the sacred old cities; and the ecclesiastical big-wigs, who garrison
them, must prepare to lay down key and crosier before the iron
conqueror.
If you consider, dear reader, what profound Snobbishness the Uni-
versity system produced, you will allow that it is time to attack some
of those feudal middle-age superstitions. If you go down for five
shillings to look at the “College Youths,” you may see one sneaking
down the court without a tassel to his cap ; another with a gold or
silver fringe to his velvet trencher ; a third lad with a master's gown
and hat, walking at ease over the sacred College grass-plats, which
common men must not tread on. -
He may do it, because he is a nobleman. Because a lad is a lord,
the University gives him a degree at the end of two years, which
another is seven in acquiring. Because he is a lord, he has no
call to go through an examination. Any man who has not been to
College and back for five shillings, would not believe in such distinc-
tions in a place of education, so absurd and monstrous do they seem
to be.
The lads with gold and silver lace are sons of rich gentlemen, and
called Fellow Commoners; they are privileged to feed better than the
pensioners, and to have wine with their victuals, which the latter can
only get in their rooms.
The unlucky boys who have no tassels to their caps, are called
sizers—serritors at Oxford, (a very pretty and gentlemanlike title).
A distinction is made in their clothes because they are poor; for which
reason they wear a badge of poverty, and are not allowed to take
their meals with their fellow-students.
When this wicked and shameful distinction was set up, it was of a
piece with all the rest—a part of the brutal, unchristian, blundering
feudal system. Distinctions of rank were then so strongly insisted
upon, that it would have been thought blasphemy to doubt them, as
blasphemous as it is in parts of the United States now, for a nigger to
set up as the equal of a white man. A ruffian like HENRY VIII.
talked as gravely about the divine powers vested in him, as if he had
been an inspired prophet. A wretch like JAMEs I. not only believed
himself a particular sanctity, but other people believed him. Govern-

his religion, or pulling a Jew's teeth out if he did not pay a contribution, or
ordered him to dress in a yellow gabardine, and locked him in a particular

Now a merchant may wear what boots he pleases, and has pretty nearly acquired
the privilege of buying and selling without the Government laying its paws upon
the bargain. The stake for heretics is gone; the pillory is taken down ; Bishops
are even found lifting up their voices against the remains of persecution, and ready
to do away with the last Catholic Disabilities. SIR Robert PEEL, though he

any means of violently handling that gentleman's jaw. Jews are not called upon

most elegant and fashionable manner.

We understand that DR. REID has undertaken, by his new system of ventila-
tion, to raise the wind to such an extent as will enable him to pay off the whole of
the National Debt in a twelvemonth. The only difficulty is in providing him with
the hundred thousand pounds that it will cost to try the experiment.

... we have in these days Public schools, Private schools,
Proprietary schools, Charity schools, Sunday schools, and

Schools for Members of Parliament. Even the soldiers are
provided with grammars, in which they may learn con-
cord in time of peace; and the policemen are provided
with circulating libraries, by means of which they may
sympathise with the sorrows of Susan Hopleys, and other
domestic heroines or victims of unmerited persecution ;
while the M.P. is left without any means of literary im-
provement. The avowed mental destitution of MR. DiLLoN
Browne has drawn general attention to the distressing
ignorance of many Members of the House of Commons,
for whom it is proposed to open schools where they may
be qualified to perform their numerous legislative duties.
The following Prospectus will, we believe, very soon be
issued —
EDUCATION.
In order to extend the blessings of education to a
class hitherto steeped in the profoundestignorance, it has
been determined to open a Preparatory school for Mem-
bers of the House of Commons. Every branch of parlia-
mentary knowledge will be taught at this establishment.
The plan of instruction will comprehend the polite arts of
saying “yes” or “no,” according to the wish of the Minis-
ter, as well as some of the higher departments of legis-
lative learning. Ciphering, sufficient to enable the stu-
dent to take part in questions of supply will be included
in the usual routine, and the rule-of-three will be taught
with a view to elucidating the theory of Government by
the Sovereign, the Lords, and the Commons.
Young Gentlemen intended for Railway Committee-
Men will be carefully instructed in the elements of Engi-
neering and the first principles of law, and writing out
the standing orders, until they are got by heart, will be
a regular portion of the daily exercise.
Bishops, desirous of availing themselves of the school,
will be well versed in translation, and members anxious
to effect a graceful change of opinion, will be got perfect
in the metamorphoses. Those who are anxious to com-
pete for the Ministerial Prizes will have an opportunity of
being thoroughly drilled by one who has kept marching
with the times, and has acquired the art of whecling to
the right or left with the utmost facility.
N.B. So much a quarter will be charged for extras,
including the usual twelve towels and silver spoon ; but
as many are born with the latter article in the mouth,
it will, in their case, lead to no inconvenience.
SIR PETER LAURDE AT CHALK FARM.
SIR PETER LAURIE has added to his tremendous
reputation for “putting down.” Nearly five years ago
he was determined to “put down suicide”—(see Punch,
vol. i.) He has now put down the Sunday-fair at Chalk
Farm—we believe a very great nuisance. At the Mary-
lebone vestry the knight himself modestly trumpetted
his triumph. “He rode up last Sunday, and the place
was quite quiet, except that one old woman asked his
permission to sell ginger-beer!” His permission I The
knight, however, 'did not inform the meeting whether he
vouchsafed it. We have little doubt, however, that he
did so ; and as little doubt that the old woman will
henceforth exhibit a board, “Licensed by SIR PETER
LAURI.E.” Yes : the knight will suffer “ginger to be hot
i' the mouth” of Sabbath wayfarers. The bounce and
froth of the liquor render it peculiarly worthy of SIR
PETER's patronage.
Early Closing.
The Sheffield Mercury says:—
“The master boot and shoe makers of Sheffield have agreed to close
their shops every evening at eight o'clock, for the future, all the year
round.”
And — in the opinion of Punch—very excellent boot-
closing, too.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE LADIES OF POLAND AND LORD DUDLEY
STUART.
Nicholas has had (and we trust will still have) to contend with
the swords of Poland; in the meantime is he punished by her needles.
The ladies of Poland have worked a magnificent piece of tapestry for
LoRD DUDLEY STUART ; and, with it, just so many stitches in the
sides of Nicholas. His Lordship eloquently acknowledged the tribute.
No man by greater earnestness of purpose ever merited a like reward.
His emotions at the time must have been worth the struggle of a life.
He said :-
“I am most anxious to seize this, the only, opportunity afforded me of assuring them
of my gratitude (cheers). I cannot, because I dare not, address my thanks to them, di-
rectly. My thanks, so addressed, would be full of danger, and might carry with them
tears of sorrow, captivity, and earile.”
* Assuredly Nicholas would make war upon the treasonous needles
of the ladies of Poland, and Siberia break a few more hearts. “But,”
said Lord STUART-
“That glorious and irresistible engine, by means of which information is diffused
everywhere, penetrating through police and prohibitions, and censorships, as the light of
the sun bursts through closed shutters and barred doors—the Press—will enable me, from
the midst of this assembly, to tender to the ladies of Poland the assurance of my deep
and heartfelt gratitude (loud cheers).”
And the engine will carry the news to the pillow of Nicholas,
will echo to him the cheers of the meeting-and every cheer a note of
inextinguishable hatred. If in a calculating mood, it may be a no
very pleasing task for the EMPERoR to reckon the probable number of
women—with hearts loathing him—who worked the piece of tapestry,
“measuring in length twenty-nine feet, in breadth nineteen feet ; ”—
tapestry containing the arms of all the ancient provinces of Poland—
provinces to be won back again It must, indeed, be a heart of
Russian iron not to quail at the thought of the amount of detestation
shown in such work; of hatred of the tyrant, and affection for the
stranger-champion. Hands widowed by Nicholas were employed in
that labour ; hands of the childless ; hands separated by tyranny
from captive and exiled dear ones. But—who can doubt it –the
labour of such hands was sweetened by hopeful thoughts ; of the
coming day of justice ; of the assured time, however tardy, that
Poland would rise in her strength, and strike down the bear that
ravens her. Working with these thoughts, the Polish women awaken
our recollection of GRAY's ode of “The Fatal Sisters; ” spinning the
woof of the future battle :-
“Glitt'ring lances are the loom
Where the dusky warp we strain,
Weaving many a soldier's doom,
Russia's wo, and Nich'LAs"bane.
“See the grisly texture grow,
('Tis of human entrails made,)
And the weights that play below,
Each a gasping warrior's head!"
We heartily congratulate Lord DUDLEY STUART on a testimonial
that, worked by such hands, as animated by such motives, may go
down to his house the noblest of its heirlooms. That Nature's noble-
man, Lord MoRPETH, very fitly presided at the ceremony of its
presentation.

GEology's a noble thing
To teach in Alma Mater,
So straight I will proceed to sing
The earth and all its strata.

Of limestone, sand, and gypsum ;

Cognoscere se ipsum.

Granite and rock are hard, I own,
To youths at school or college ;
But then there's nought so good as stone
To form the road to knowledge.

And in my next I'll take a view

{literary Hintelligence,
WE have heard a rumour that the SERGEANT-AT-ARMs, in attendance
on MR. SMITH O'BRIEN, is preparing an account of the Martyr's cap-
tivity. It is expected that the book will rival in popularity the “Im-
prisonments of SILvio PELLIco.” The volume will be chiefly occupied
with conversations, of which the following is an interesting specimen :-
Smith O'Brien. What's o'clock 2
Sergeant-at-Arms. A quarter to twelve.
Smith O'B. Bless me ! No more What is there for dinner *
Sergeant-at-Arms. Anything you like to order.
Smith O'B. I say ! I’m getting rather sick of this.
Sergeant-at-Arms. So am I, by Jingol It's worse for me than for
you : I don't get even the credit of Martyrdom.
Smith O'B. Pretty credit, indeed Why, I never was so quizzed
in all my life. Besides, I never bargained for being shot down into this
blessed cellar, like so much Wall's-end. I thought we should occupy
the Tower.
Sergeant-at-Arms. Or, perhaps, the quod-rangle.
* Smith O'B. Come, I say, Sergeant, you've no right to cut your jokes
at my expense. Its quite bad enough to be the butt of the newspapers.
Sergeant-at-Arms. Well, if you are a butt, you can't object to my
giving you a gentle tap occasionally.
Smith O'B. Well, well, lay out the tea-things; let’s bury our ani-
mosity in a cup of Twankay. Where's the hot-water 2
ºran. I'faith, MisTER SMITH O'BRIEN, you are never out
of it.
Such is the discourse in which SMITH O'BRIEN and his jailer were
frequently occupied. Sometimes an altercation ensued, but it generally
ended in reconciliation over the cup which “cheers but not inebriates,

THE OPE
|||||||
||||||
|
* TUESDAY, the twentieth of May, will ever be a disgraceful day in
the calendar of Fashion, in consequence of its having been signalised by
an émeute at the Opera. The indignation of the audience at that aris-
tocratic establishment was roused by MARIo having incurred the vulgar
inconvenience of a cold, which muffled the drum of his ear, causing
him to sing out of tune,—and placed an obstruction in his throat, through
which the usually bell-like notes came forth with guttural hoarseness.
The subscribers felt that MARIo had no right to catch cold, or that he
should have made an arrangement with the malady, by which it might
have made its appearance on alternate evenings. They accordingly
got up an Opera Row ; such as, happily for the character of the patrons
of the Surrey and Victoria, can only be got up by an Opera, audience.
In their indiscriminate rage, they attacked not only those who did not
appear, but hissed most vociferously those who were doing their best to
prevent disappointment by exerting themselves to the utmost to carry
on the performances. Poor PERRot, who was skipping about with all
the energy of a roasted chesnut, and the impetuosity of a parched pea,
was rewarded by the most ungrateful marks of disapprobation. He
rushed forward frantically to the front of the stage, and attempted to
tear his hair, when—recollecting he wore a property-wig–a sense of
duty to the management stayed his hand, which had already clutched to notice the bold and striking
the worsted tresses. He however contented himself with an address, in finale to I Lombardi, of which
which he declared emphatically that he had always done his
“possible.” But his “possible” was not enough, for it is quite clear
that the “impossible” is what is looked for by the subscribers to the
Opera at the hands of the management.
Such an émeute was never before witnessed in any theatre. At Drury
Lane, the performers have been allowed to enjoy the privilege of ill
health, without the slightest objection on the part of the public ; but
at Her Majesty's Theatre, indisposition on the part of a performer is
more than the audience can tolerate.
Perhaps there may have been an impression that caprice had some-
RA ROW.
-
thing to do with the illness of MARIO. We know that poor MR. LUMLEY
has had occasionally to complain of colds caught by one singer on
account of an air in the mouth—of another being rather too strong ;
but as we happened to be present at a recent rehearsal, we can answer
for there having been no affectation of illness on the present occasion.
The accompanying sketch gives
an idea of the scene we wit-
nessed, when a rehearsal was
proceeding under circumstances
of severe catarrh on the part of
all the principal vocalists.
It was fearful to hear the
beautiful language of Italy
drained as it were through a
stocking, and the delicious Ah /
mon guinge, transmogrified into
Ah/ lol guilge, by the cold in the
head of the prima-donna.
While we are on the subject
of the Opera, we cannot omit
we subjoin a pictorial represen-
tation. It comprises a solo by
one of the Knights Crusaders,
executing what may be called
a sweeping passage. The neat-
ness and precision with which
it is performed excites general
admiration, every evening of the
performance of the Opera.
THE ADMIRALTY COUNTER-BLAST AGAINST
TOBACCO.
The sailor's two wishes, it is well known, were first—“All the 'bacco
in the world;” and secondly, “More 'bacco.” And now, were it possible
for JACK to have both his wishes, what would they avail him 2 The
Admiralty have set their faces against the weed, unless smoked before
8 P.M. by the galley-fire : very pleasant this, especially in summer
time; since the place (as a letter-writer in the Times observes) is not
capable “ of holding one-twentieth part of a crew's smokers; no, not
if they were jammed together as tight as the fingers of a fist l” We
understand that the sailors are in a great excitement at this attempt
to make them so very genteel. An Admiralty order may compel them
next to curl their hair, and cultivate it with bear's-grease ; to which
end, a bear or two (for long voyages) may be added to the ship's
company.
Does LoRD ELLENBoRough sanction this counter-blast against JACK's
tobacco 2 If so, he is certainly no less than the modern Captain Whiffle,
who, according to Roderick Random, brought such sweet airs on board
the Thunder, and who “sank down in a fit” at the scent of the weed.
MR. S.MolleTT informs us that :—
“As MoRGAN proceeded in his speech, he continued advancing towards the captain,
whose nostrils were no sooner saluted with the aromatic flavour that exhaled from him,
than he cried, with great emotion, “Heaven preserve me ! I am suffocated 1 Fellow,
fellow, away with thee! Curse thee, fellow, get thee gone !’”
Assuredly, unless the order be rescinded, Punch's artist must have
his Admiralty Captain Whiffle, according to the novelist, “faintin
on a settee” with a valet-de-chambre plying smelling-bottles, and
footmen sprinkling lavender-water. --
The Hermit Sold,
AMongst the new attractions of Vauxhall, it is intended to give a
view of the Martyr's cell. An offer has been made to MR. SMITH
O'BRIEN to act the Martyr for ten nights. It is only feared that
his engagement will give offence to BARRY, the clown.

VER SES,
supposed To Be witHTTEN BY willIAM SMITH O'BRIEN,
During his solitary Abode in the Cellar of the House of Commons.
IAM monarch of all I survey ;
My right there is none to dispute ;
From the breakfast-time round to the tay,
I see neither Saxon nor brute.
O Solitude 1 where's the atthractions,
That sages have seen in your face 7
Better dwell in the midst of the Saxons,
Than reign in this horrible place.
I am out of humanity's reach,
I must finish the Session alone,
Ne'er cry “hear !” to an illigant speech,-
Sure I start at the sound of my own.
Them beasts, the attindants and waithers,
My form with indifference see ;
They are so unaccustomed to Marthyrs,
Their coolness is shocking to me.
Society—blarney—abuse—
Gifts dear to the boys of my name !
O if I had the wings of a goose,
It's soon I’d be out of this same.
I then might enliven my gloom
In the ways of repalers and men,
Might learn from the wisdom of HUME,
And be cheer'd by the sallies of BEN.
Ye Mimbers, that make me your sport,
O convey to this desolate door
A Times, with a faithful report
Of the House I shall visit no more.
My frinds, sure they now and then sind
A joke or a laugh after me *
O tell me I yet have a frind,
Though BENTINCK I'm never to see.
The attindant is gone to his rest,
The Saxon lies down in his lair,
While I think of the Isle of the West,
And turn up my bed” in despair.
Iłut whisky is still to be had ;
And the whisky—encouraging thought !
As it is not by any means bad,
Half reconciles me to my lot.
PEEL AND HIS PARTY.
THE ultra-Tories, with the Post for their mouthpiece, are loud in their
abuse of PEEL ; and yet one would have thought him just the man, both
for them and our fashionable contemporary. Who can better figure in
the mazes of the political quadrille 7–who execute with more address
the graceful and difficult movements, balance2 to the right and left,
hands across, change partners, chassez, croisez, down the middle and up
again * With these accomplishments, he ought to be their downright
idol; such recommendations being precisely those of “a nice young man
for a small party.”
CAUTION TO PERSONS VISITING EPSOM.
PERsons wearing moustachios at Epsom on the Derby Day, are
hereby cautioned that moustachios being the legitimate mark of a
military man, every person appearing in a pair of those appendages
will be required to produce his commission, showing the regiment to
which he belongs, the rank he holds, and the date of his admission
into the army. Shop-boys, lawyers' clerks, and milliners' young men
wearing false moustachios for the day, will be expected to produce
a certificate of character from their masters and employers. All other
persons wearing moustachios will be regarded as suspicious characters,
and taken into custody.
Respectability.
AN account of the suicide of an unhappy woman, unknown, has
appeared in the papers. The penny-a-liner profoundly observed: “She
had been in a respectable condition of life, the appearance of her hands
showing she had not been subjected to hard work.” Thus, hear it, ye
labouring base, “hard work” is not “respectable.”
• The Martyr is accommodated with a very neat “folding bed.
PUNCH*S REVIEW.
The Works of George Robins:—(In Times, folio).
OUR friend Robins is scarcely equal to himself this season. The
poetry of his advertisements has not the free, the sledge-hammer swing
of former years. We have known more florid eloquence invite the
purchase of a metal tea-pot than Robins now puts forth for the sale
of the two or three Elysiums always on hand. For, as dear Tom Hoop
said of Robins, he is like unto the Evil One, always “knocking down”
somebody's paradise. Take a sample ! RoBINs would sell “the entire
Hamlet of Willenhall, in Warwickshire.” Now, if it were CHARLEs
KEAN's Hamlet, he couldn't make a poorer thing of it. He says :-
“The Elizabethan villa is altogether adapted to a gentleman's occupation. It probably
might be improved by a finishing stroke from the hand of an artiste. There is; besides,
one of the farm-houses where the proprietor would be but too happy to take up his quar-
ters occasionally during the sporting season.”
This is flat, and small, compared with the sparkling thoughts of other
seasons:–
“Longevity prevails on this ºr. and some time since, this was proved by
MR. BLUE (close by,) retiring into a better world, at the advanced age of 108.”
This, it must be confessed, is a touch worthy of the master. The
“retiring into a better world,” is very nicely, delicately hinted. Had
MR. BLUE “retired” to some country-box and not to his coffin, the
fashionable movement could not have been more prettily chronicled.
MR. Robins begs to ask (“and with earnestness,” mind):—
“If the every-day observation, resounding now from all quarters, that the agricultural
community have been more frightened than hurt, is not rendered most manifest by the
above unassuming recital of facts 2 "
Robins is evidently one of SIR Robert PEEL's converts : he now
sees the necessity of an alteration of the Corn Laws ; whilst last
season he triumphantly quoted the Minister's avowal, that “no altera-
tion was contemplated.” But Robins, like meaner men, has been
converted.
The next lot, gentle reader, is “Seven House Demesne,” near
Bristol. It is placed on an eminence, and—
“The luxuriant shrubberies and plantations that encircle it, keep the cold winds at a
most respectable distance.”
Indefiniteness is one of the elements of high poetry, and here we
have it. The improvement of cattle is oddly enough prescribed by
Doctor RoBINs as a remedy for ennui : black-faced sheep may be
made to cure blue-devils ; for there is—
“A snug little farm-house and buildings, giving to the industrious views of the pro-
prietor a very delightful resource to fill up an occasional idle hour, beside leisure in
improving the breed of his cattle; thus combining the art of driving away ennui (if it
should presume to make its unwelcome appearance) from this seat of happy contentment.".
Had we listened to the mob-eloquence of a cheap Jack—or to the
Demosthenic appeals of a mock-auctioneer putting off plated goods on
the unwary bumpkin—the effort would not have called for comment.
But it is otherwise with the rhapsodies of a Robins; for, though at
the first blush they seem especially concocted for the meanest under-
standing, we must not forget that they are expressly put forth to
catch the rich and aristocratic. A profound compliment to the intelli-
gence of high-life
A RAILWAY CEMETERY.
WHAT is to be done with all the
defunct Railway schemes f
is now the question in many
quarters. Considering the
number of mourners over the
departed projects, is it right
that they should be left with-
out a decent burial 2 We beg
leave to propose a Cemetery
on a large scale for the inter-
ment of the late much-la-
mented Railways. Is it con-
sistent with the dignity of so
many illustrious branches of
the Railway family that they
should be left to perish with-
out a monument to their
memory? The lines of York
and Lancaster, of which so
many have been cut off,
must not be permitted to mingle in that dust—with which they were
unable to come down—unmarked by a single slab of reminiscence. We

are quite sure that a Cemetery devoted to defunct Railway schemes'
would be visited by many sincere mourners, in the shape of attorneys,
engineers, scrip-holders, and provisional committee-men. As to the
lawyers, they might write eulogistic inscriptions in a truly parental
style of affectionate regret; for the attorneys are, in many instances,
the parents of the lines—which were looked upon in many cases, as
the medium of consolation and support in old age for the lawyers who
brought the schemes into existence. We give our readers a pair of
very elegant designs for monuments to be erected in the Railway
Cemetery which we have suggested.
3. Degrabet, 3 cabemp.
(Being a letter from PETER PERUGINo FLATTs, 110, Berners Street, to his
friend, Michael ANGELo McGUILP, 24, Strada Balbi, Rome.)
” “You remember, dear friend, our last dinner at the Lepra, when
you paid the bill, amounting to four paoli and two baiocchi, to GIAcomo,
the waiter, on condition that I sent you a critique on the exhibition of
the Royal Academy in this wretchedly inartistic city. I proceed to
fulfil my promise.
“In two words, the whole affair is disgusting. Art I my dear fellow, the
artists here don't understand the meaning of the word ; so what can be
expected of the critics You know my early Christian Madonna col
Bambino, which, I remember, you thought equal to Giotto, and in which
I flattered myself I had caught a smack of the Byzantine inspiration ?
Well, the miserable ignoramuses here, who are paid so much per line
for criticising, (heaven save the mark 1) call it flat, wooden, tea-boardy,
dead-alive, pseudo-German, everything but what it really is—a grand,
severe, and inspired work I This for a sample. To judge by their
works, the daubers in England don't seem to be aware of the existence
of a school before RAPHAEL. Instead of following the sublime exam-
ple of Germany, and plunging into the renovating bath of ancient
inspiration, they go to Nature I Nature my dear Michael ANGELo;
as if ours was not emphatically an art, and so bound to reject
Nature altogether.
“I give you my word, except my own Madonna col Bambino, which
is packed into a choking little closet (called the Dust-hole), there is
only one work with which a man educated to high art can sympathise;
another Madonna col Bambino, by one DycE, a fine, hard, and grandly-
felt work, in the style of the Umbrian School of the fourteenth century,
in which Nature, as they call it, is boldly and entirely departed from.
One of two soi-disant critics to whom I was introduced had the impu-
dence to take me to a wretched little daub, ‘A Mother and Child,’ by
one LESLIE, and to tell me that was “his” Madonna col Bambino.
Don't be misled by the title. It wasn't a Madonna at all, but a com-
monplace English mother, kissing a nasty little half-naked brat of a
bantling—a bit of the commonest life. They might be MRs. P. P.
*::::: and our first-born. If I painted her, it should be as a St. Cecilia
at least.
“I thought better of English art some years since. It seemed to be
following the true track, in the wake of the glorious Germans, and
might now have reached the sublime symbolic idealism of the thirteenth
century. But it has allowed itself to be turned aside, and is completely
ruined by a vicious study of Nature.
“As for the landscapes, instead of the seven brown trees and sweetly
regular hills we have so often admired in the beautiful backgrounds of
PERUGINo, I find literal things by LEE and CREswick, real green woods
and lanes and river-sides, such as one may see any day in Sussex
and Devonshire. It is enough to drive a classically-minded man to
| despair.
“In fact, English art is sinking rapidly into the slough of common
life in everything. Her painters seem to have no higher aim than to
paint what lies before them.
“It seems clear that no prize-holder in the Art-Union will buy my
Madonna col, &c. Would you advise me to paint out the glory, and
turn it into a Countrywoman and Baby ?
“Send me your advice, and believe me ever, your brother in art,
* P. P. FLATTS.
“N.B. I have painted out the glory. A friend of mine has got an
£80 prize in the A. U.”
DRESS FOR DELINQUENTS.
The newspapers have lately published the decision of a Court-Martial
holden lately at Dublin, on gunner and driver JAMEs GRAY, No. 370,
of the Royal Artillery, who was arraigned on the following charges :—
“1. For having been drunk on patrolling ºl." on or about the evening of the
15th of March, 1846, at Portobello Barracks, Dublin.
“2. For having, at Portobello Barracks, Dublin, on or about the evening of the 15th
of March, 1846, struck, and afterwards kicked, Company-Sergeant William HAwkins,
of the Royal Artillery, his superior officer, when in the execution of his duty.”
On both these charges the man was found guilty; whereon the Court
Martial adjudged—
“That the prisoner, gunner and driver JAMEs GRAY, No. 370, of the Royal Artillery,
be transported as a felon for seven years.”
Discipline, of course, must be maintained ; still, could we procure
for this poor fellow a somewhat milder doom than transportation, we
should be glad. Had we been his counsel, we should have suggested an
expedient to him which might, possibly, have answered that purpose.
We would have advised him to appear before his judges in a suit of
sable, instead of in his uniform, and in a white cravat in place of his
stock, to which, we think, we would have added bands, and perhaps a
cassock. An offender looks so differently in a black coat from what he
. in a blue or a red one ! The cloth makes such a difference to the
culprit !
Lately, in several interesting instances, delinquents differing only
from JAMEs GRAY in respect of the above-mentioned externals, except that
some of them were more guilty, and all had less excuse than the Artil-
lery-man, have been merely suspended from their offices for some three
months. GRAY might, perhaps, have escaped the punishment of a felon,
could he only have claimed the benefit of Clergy.
THE KNELL OF PROTECTION.
FULL fathom five Protection lies ;
On her bones are carols made ;
Those are cut that were her ties :
Nothing of her that doth fade
But doth suffer a PEEL-change,
Into Commerce free to range.
Landlords hourly ring her knell:
Hark! now I hear them—ding-dong, bell.
(Burden—on the land.)—Ding-dong, bell.
* Nosce Teipsum."
IN the course of the debate on the Roman Catholic Pains and Pen-
alties, (which, to the disgrace of Parliament, the dismay of PLUMPTRE,
the disgust of the British Lion, and the speedy destruction of the
Empire, are about to be abolished,) the Bishop of ExETER described
the Law as “the most unaccountable and contradictory thing with
which he had any acquaintance.” Has the Bishop, then, no acquaint-
ance with himself? If so, we congratulate him sincerely, despite the
musty proverb above quoted.
RATHER STIFF.NECKED.
THERE is an individual in the Strand who advertises “Cravats for
the Prince and the People.” Surely this association of Prince and
People in the same Cravat is enough to raise His Royal Highness's
choler. We can scarcely see how this unity of Cravat is to be attained.
It reminds us of the sworn friends who had one heart, one purse, and
one hat. The latter circumstance induces the supposition that the
friends were CASToR and Pollux.

Qt)apter 32xtraorbinary at Cºlegtminster Abbey.
SPECIAL MEETING of the Dean
and Chapter of Westminster
was convened yesterday mor-
ming for the purpose of taking
into consideration the alarm-
ing decrease in the number of
visitors to the Abbey which
has lately occurred, and of
devising some means of re-
newing the popularity of the
Exhibition.
A Reverend Dignitary stated
it as his opinion, that the
falling off was attributable
mainly to the superior attrac-
tion of a rival establishment
in Baker Street: he meant
MADAME TUss AUD's. Why
did not his reverend brethren advertise 2 -
Another prebend concurred with the last speaker. The public taste
was most deplorable ; they preferred a parcel of trumpery wax-works
to the finest productions of the chisel, and by consequence the chisel
in westminster Abbey was much less productive than it used to be.
But perhaps it was not generally known that the Abbey price was only
sixpence instead of a shilling, and no extra for any “ chamber of horrors.”
Were this fact promulgated, the chisel might cut out the wax-work
yet. Advertise, by all means. Suppose they sent a revolving-cart
about the streets º' They had the authority of Moses for so doing.
A third member of the Chapter inquired whether they might not add
a few costumes to their collection ? Tussaud had adopted this expe-
dient with success. -
To this proposition, however, it was demurred that the speculation
involved a risk; for, although the nation found the monuments, it
would probably object to provide dresses for them.
A fourth prebend observed, that, at all events, it would not cost much
to placard the town with a few posters; “Do, Papa, take me to see
Westminster Abbey,” would be a capital one; especially as children
were not admitted half-price. -- - - -
A fifth suggested, that at the gratuitous exhibition on Sundays,
handbills, setting forth the particulars of the week-day entertainment,
should be distributed amongst the crowd. -
Some discussion ensued with respect to this suggestion, which, it was
agreed, was a capital one, if the public, with its prejudices as to
decorum, would stand the adoption of such a plan. The only question
was, whether it was safe, and the meeting separated with the reso-
lution that it should stand over for consideration.
POLICE REVIEW.
THE gentleman who would get a lily out of his garden, and, taking a
five-pound brush, commence the operation of painting it, would scarcely
be guilty of greater absurdity than we should be if we were to attempt
to add to the richness of the following paragraph. It is a little piece of
humorous writing with which we will not attempt competition.
“INsprotion of THE MANchestER Borough Police.—The police force of thi
borough having recently been supplied with new clothing—(no alteration being made in
the uniform)—it was arranged that the watch committee should inspect the men when
clothed in their new uniforms, and Monday last was fixed upon for that purpose. All
the force in the four preventive divisions, A, B, C, and D, with their ºl.
inspectors, and sub-inspectors, in all about 400 men, were inspected by the watch com-
mittee of the council; amongst the members of whom present were Mk. ALDERMAN
Neild, the chairman of the committee, MR. ALDERMAN WILLERT, MR. Alnkhai AN
Potten, MR. Georg's NRLson, MR. Brown, &c. The men looked exceedingly well in
their new uniforms, the make J which was approved. They were put through a few of
the ordinary manoruvres of what is termed “company drill,’ with which the committee
expressed themselves much pleased. * - * **
What a rich idea it is, on the part of the Manchester authorities, to
review the Police whenever they get a new suit of clothes, and criticise
the cut of their habiliments 1 We thought our London raw-lobstery
comprised a considerable amount of dandyism; but it is evident that
the Metropolitan police cannot be compared with the Manchester
exquisites. We should like to know what are a few of the “ordinary
manoeuvres that the men were put through on the occasion of their re-
cent drilling 2 “Present staff " " “Crack skull !” and “Fire bull's-
eye ' " are doubtless among the words of command in vogue among the
police of Manchester.
The Manchester police are, it appears, on the same authority,
famous for their “moral influence ; ” that is precisely their strong
point in London. The “moral influence” they exercise over cooks
and servants-of-all-work is really marvellous.
PUNCH*S POLITICAL DICTIONARY.
JUSTINLAN. A kind of Roman BLAckston E. He was the author of
a code, and devoured the law with considerable eagerness; but he
digested it all, and his digestion, or digest, is admitted to be excellent.
He subsequently brought out a quantity of new laws, which he called
Novels—perhaps in the hope of getting people to read them.
KING. The head of a State, and in France a target for regicides.
In constitutional monarchies the King is nominally supreme, but
really powerless. He has the choice of his ministers; but this is
always Hobson's choice ; for he is obliged to select those who are
supported by the Parliament. The King is the fountain of honour, and
supplies several pumps, who get their honour laid on direct from the
fountain. He can declare war; but he is not worth powder and shot
to carry it on, unless he has the consent of Parliament. Though he
is obliged to put his name to every bill, in order to give it value, and
accepts every one that is laid before him, he is not responsible. It is
a maxim that the King can do no wrong, and that he never dies—two
important facts, of which Charles THE FIRST failed to take the
benefit. The King of a free country, like a King in the game of
chess, may always be subjected to a check, when he lays himself open
to it. Though his course may be eccentric, and he may move in any
and every direction, he can only take one step at a time; so that he
cannot go far astray, and may be checked immediately.
KNIGHT-KNIGHTHood. In the dark ages, the people were liable to
find themselves be-knighted against their will ; for the King used to
summon them to the field as Knights, for the purpose of getting their
services. CHARLEs THE FIRst used to raise money by making Knights,
and exacting a large fee; but an attempt to turn day into night, by
making a Knight of one John DAY, caused the greatest dissatisfaction.
Knighthood is now conferred at a very cheap rate ; but the fall in the
price has caused a diminution in its value. When the Sovereigns
dined in the City, it was usual to grant the honour to the LoRD
MAYor; and the Merry Monarch is reported to have said, that he
always on such an occasion liked to make a (k)night of it.
LORD ELLENBOROUGH AND THE NAVY.
LoRD ELLENBorough has been making a speech at the Royal Naval
School Festival, in which he declared his predilection for Naval society.
He sneered at people serving their country in the study, and came to
the conclusion that a man was much better employed when “blazing
away” in the field of battle. We understand that his Lordship carries
his love of naval habits to such an extent that his dining-room is fitted
up like the cabin of a ship ; he is waited on by men dressed as tars,
and he gives his orders in nautical phraseology. “Shove the marling
spike athwart the ribs of that stove,” is the form of expression he
adopts when he wishes his servant to poke the fire; and “Come, rig
my main top,” is the style in which he requests the assistance of his
valet in the arrangement of his hair for dinner; “clear the decks"
means “take away the breakfast things,” and when he cuts down some
wood on his estate, his Lordship gives instructions that a certain portion
of his timbers shall be immediately shivered.
The little experiment of the Bellerophon is repeated every now and
then in his own mansion ; all the furniture of which is carried out of
all the rooms, thrown into the backyard, and replaced with the utmost
rapidity. All the bells in his establishment are sometimes set ringing
at once, for no purpose but to test the rapidity with which they may be
answered. In fact, Lord ELLENBorough is a much better seaman at
home than out of doors, where he is sometimes rather at fault for want
of experience.
THE SCHOOLMASTER QUITE ABROAD.
LoRD BRough AM could not lay the first stone of a new Wing to
University College Hospital without having a fling at Oxford and
Cambridge. If his Lordship gets a stone into his hand, he must, it
seems, have a shy at somebody.
His Lordship has been giving an outrageous puff to the London
University, and deprecating the “City vulgarity” of sending youth
“to be corrupted at Oxford and Cambridge.” Considering that the
London University contributes a very large proportion of the police
cases that come before the metropolitan Magistrates during the medical
session, (as a return of all the knockers wrenched off in the neighbour-
hood of the New Road between the beginning of October and the end
of July would show,) we do not see that the Institution lays peculiar
claim to support on the strength of its conventional proprieties. We
think, as far as vulgarity goes, the concern in Gower Street may vie
with the older establishments on the Cam and Isis.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

FASHIONABLE MOVEMENTS.
R. PUNCH,-IT is with unmitigated disgust
that I am compelled every week to
read your unhallowed attacks on all
that is good and gracious in this free
and happy country. I say,+and say
it advisedly,–compelled, for I would
not read you if I could help it. But,
I confess it, there is a horrible fascina-
tion about your pages that makes me
fly to them. Willy-nilly, they attract
me as the loadstone rock attracted
tenpenny nails. It is that attraction
that now seizes upon my iron pen, and
urges me to lift up my feeble voice
against your atrocious attempts to de-
stroy the Englishman's idol, the palla-
dium of Britain, the shrine that embo-
dies the “glory and the grace and the power' of this free and enlight-
ened land ; I mean, Sir–Snobbery !
“When, week after week, I witness your ruthless assaults upon the
lilies of my native soil, and when neither MR. WILson CRoKER, nor
MR. SILR BUCKINGHAM, nor any other champion of the graceful
courtesies of life, comes forward to oppose you, I feel that the time has
arrived for meek and modest men to cast away their reserve, and fear-
lessly to bare the manly bosom to the envenomed shaft of ridicule !
“The unfortunate individual who writes your “Snobs of England,'—
I say unfortunate, for though I feel it to be mystern duty to lash him as
a criminal, I cannot therefore cease to feel for him as a fellow-creature,
—that unfortunate being has laughed his loud and satyr-like laugh,
at the ‘fashionable movements’ gladdening and illumining the daily
papers. Poor creature he little knows that these ‘movements’ are
the very pulses of the social body—the arterial blood of John Bull.
When I read that
“GENERAL
has let his house in Square,"—
why then, Sir, “my heart leaps up much more briskly than did
ever MR. Wordsworth's at any rainbow soever. For, consider it,
Sir. As an Englishman, and therefore a worshipper of property, what
a delightful feeling it is to think that GENERAL has a house in a
square : how the knowledge of that delicious fact makes my heart's
blood simmer gratefully. And then how my sympathies are touched,
my interest excited My imagination follows the General's lawyer,
goes with him to the lawyer of the incoming tenant, broods over the
parchment lease, and finally rejoices as the signatures of the con-
tracting parties are affixed, and the legal fact is made manifest that—
HAS let his house in
* GENERAL
Square " '
But the benighted person who perpetrates the “Snobs’ knows nothing
of these sublimating emotions. I would as soon ask a Greenlander's
opinion of Tokay !
“I have long meditated on the subject : and I am convinced that
we owe the revolutionary spirit at present abroad to the imperfect
manner in which the “fashionable movements’ are chronicled. If
they were more detailed ; if they entered more fully into the doings
and feelings of the illustrious folks, for whose peculiar glorification
they are put forth, the people would be led away from the contem-
plation of the potato-blight, the income-tax, and vulgar subjects dis-
cussed in Parliament. Much, I know, is done,—but nevertheless
very imperfectly,–to attract popular attention from stupid politics to
the walkings and ridings in high-life. Permit me, Mr. Punch, to
avail myself of your reputation for liberality—a reputation that, as
the phrase goes, is become European—to explain myself. I take a
few notices from the papers at random :—
‘Her Royal Highness the Duchess or CaMnnidae visited her Royal Highness
The Duchess of KENt yesterday at Clarence House, St. James's."
Now this intelligence is delightful—as far as it goes. But why not
give the colour of the Duchess's carriage, with the height of the coach-
man and footman, and the circumference of their calves 2 It is true,
we are possessed with the important fact that the Duchess of CAM-
BRIDGE visited the DUCHEss of KENT, but we are left in the dark
as to the particular room in which the Duchess was received ; neither
are we informed which lady first said, “Good morning.” Now, these
matters, it strikes me, are sad omissions. As it is allowed to be essen-
tial to the happiness and quietude of this great country to know of
“Again :-
‘The MARquis AND MARchion Ess of LoNDoNDERay and LADY AlexandrainAVANE
have returned to Holdernesse House from Paris.”
“It must be rapturous intelligence to every lover of his country, to
know that the Marquis is within a short cab-fare of the House of
Lords. But curiosity pants for further food. Did the Marquis, the
Marchioness, and the fair ALEx ANDRINA, arrive riá Dover or Folke-
stone And did the Marquis journey in a hat or a bonnet de royage 2
“This is better —
“The EARL AND Countrss of ARRAN and family, the Count AND Countrss de St.
GroRGE, and M. A. ELMoRE, have arrived at the ship Hotel, Dover, from Ostend, by
the Belgian mail-packet, in 4h. 30m., against a strong S. W. wind.”
“Here the public is not half-starved upon the short intelligence of
the mere arrival of the Earl and Countess; but its laudable curiosity
is in a measure gratified by the knowledge of the identical point of
wind that blew against them.
“The following, however, from the same daily source, is small and
meagre :-
* Count wachmustra embarked at Blackwall yesterday morning, on board the
General Steam Navigation Company's steam-ship Columbine, for Rotterdam.”
“Now, Mr. Punch, as one of an intelligent public, I must protest
against this garbled news. Why am I to be tantalized with the mere
knowledge that Count WACHMUsTER was carried off by a Columbine 2
I want to know his particular berth on board the ship, with the hour
he retired to rest,--which leg he first put into bed, whether right or
left, when he rose in the morning, at what time he shaved, and with
what water, cold or hot ?
Nor can any reasonable Briton be satisfied with the mere fact
that—
“The DowAGER MARchioness of Quer:Nsherry is sojourning at Leamington.”
No, Sir : for if it be essential for his country to know the tre-
mendous fact that the Dowager is absolutely, unequivocally, and
without any mistake whatever, at Leamington, it is also vital to the
peace of the nation, to be informed of the Dowager's domestic arrange-
ments. The country demands it.
“And now, Mr. Punch, although I feel this letter to be very
imperfect, and by no means equal to the theme, I trust I have suffi-
ciently indicated in it, what I would have done by the purveyors of
fashionable intelligence. Feeling that the true happiness of the people
consists in the knowledge of the movements of their betters, in know-
ing where they visit, where they tarry, and what opera they witness,
I do think that the perfect bliss of the country can only be realised by
telling ererything connected with such truly national doings.
“I am a father of six children, and it is my boast as a father and a
Briton, that I regularly bind the Morning Post, and have had all my
little ones taught their alphabet out of MR. BURRE's Peerage.
“I remain, Your obedient Servant,
“SLAVERLY FitzTo ADY.”
“ Unless you would have your otherwise agreeable miscellany
banished from the houses of the truly patriotic and respectable, you
will immediately discharge the person who defiles Punch with the
‘Snobs of England.’”
THE HUSBAND’S FRIEND.
It is proverbially advantageous to have a friend at Court; and the
truth of this adage was exemplified the other day in the Court of
Queen's Bench, in which a gentleman found a friend who performed in his
behalf one of the most delicate and perhaps dangerous offices of friend-
ship, that of defending his cause against his own wife. The fact in
question is recorded in the report of the case of DALY v. DALY.
For the defendant, it was argued that an action of ejectment was an
action of trespass, and that no wife could, according to the law of
England, be a trespasser against her husband. It is to be wished that
the law of England in this respect were in accordance with matter of
fact : but this by the way. Lond DENMAN, however, overruled the
objection, and, in delivering judgment for the plaintiff, spoke as fol-
lows:–
“The objection of identity between the interest of a wife and her husband was tech-
nical and artificial, and was, in the present case, effectually met by another consideration
of a technical nature; namely, that in the present action, not the husband, but John
Doe was the plaintiff.”
We never thought to speak a word of praise for John Dor ; but we
now pronounce him a capital fellow. Let him henceforth be called
the visit, why should not the full felicity of the nation be insured by
more minute information ?
“ the Husband's Friend.” Would that MR. John DoE’s sphere of
usefulness in that capacity could be extended !

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WAR AND WOMEN.
THEY have been dining in the East in honour of the late victories .
many speeches were of course fired off in glorification of the slaughter.
One MAJoR WATT, however, made a somewhat ungallant discovery.
He gave “the ladies,” and said :—
“The laurel on the soldier's brow, and the ribbon on his breast, were pleasing to the
bright and brilliant eyes of beauty, by whom they were first designed as emblems of vic-
tory, and for that reason alone, independent of others, these emblems would ever be
coveted, and regarded as true and lasting honours.”
This is very right and very wrong. There is no doubt that women
(foolish darlings that they are 1) do love glory. That is, they love
the epaulets, and the fine clothes, and the beautiful feathers, (they like
birds of paradise on the same principle), and the braying trumpets
and the beating drums. They do love glory in the full dress of full
parade; but we hope they do not love glory en deshabille; with a gash
or two in his skull—his jaw-bone smashed—his leg or his arm, or
both, carried away,+screaming with agony upon the bloody earth.
We are sure they do not like glory thus plucked, any more than they
would like a plucked peacock.
And now, MAJoh WATT, about the “laurel” and the “ribbon ?”
Did woman really design them as emblems ? Did VENUs really culti-
vate a pot of laurels (as though they were fancy heartsease) for MARs 2
Did she really design the “ribbon” on his breast, in the same way
that a later Salisbury VENUs originated the garter 2 You are a mili-
tary man, MAJoit WATT ; nevertheless, you are wrong—we do not
believe you. Woman (poor soul | ) may have much to answer for ;
she may have been the teterrima causa belli, but she did not invent the
emblems of successful carnage any more than she invented gunpowder
and Paixhan shells. Her “bright and brilliant eyes” try rocket prac-
tice of a different sort.
And yet, says MAJoR WATT :—
“This was sufficient to show that war and women—beauty and victory—were so closely
combined as to preclude the possibility of doing honour to the one without the other.”
War and women closely combined For ourselves, we do not
believe it. However, should it be true, it is certainly a truth to be
well considered by “those about to marry.”
THE LAW-HARMONICON.
Wr, hope the scheme lately proposed, of instructing young barristers
in music, has not becn abandoned ; for harmony cannot prevail to too
great an extent in any profession ; and, moreover, if the views of
counsel could be further harmonised, we should have less, perhaps, to
complain of the law's uncertainty. We have, accordingly, much
pleasure in contributing to the promotion of this object, by the
suggestion of a new style of instrument, which will be much more
suitable than the present piano for accompaniments to forensic airs.
Its construction is very simple, consisting merely of an arrangement of
keys, by which, on being struck, certain shillings and sixpences are
made to impinge on as many sovereigns, appended to vibrating wires,
thereby producing a species of music which will be most agreeable to
the legal car. The production of cash-notes, in fact, is the great
object of all pleadings, to which, when vocalised, the gold-and-silvery
sounds of this instrument will be very appropriate.
It will also have the peculiar advantage of cnabling the student to
practise in the key of Fee, of all others the most delightful to a pleader,
and the best accompaniment to the brief; also furnishing the most
eligible quavers for legal crotchets, or opinions. The attorney as well
as the barrister may perform upon this instrument, since it may readily
be made to play the tune of Six-and-Eightpence.
Lastly, it possesses a depth of tone which will accord with the lowest
Old Bailey practice, giving it a vast superiority over the common piano,
which is by no means base enough for all lawyers.
-
Sibthorpe in Despair.
THE gallant militia Colonel is at his wits' end, and where that may
be, who shall say ? However, it is quite clear that no words the
indomitable militia-man can utter, have the slightest effect upon the
pachydermatous PEEL. A night or two since, the laurel-loaded Colonel
called the Prime Minister “an instance of apostacy, hypocrisy, and
perfidy ; ” and—we sigh for human nature —the callous Sir Robert
smiled in the Colonel's face. Since the hardest and unseemliest words
have failed, we see no other missiles left for the gallant soldier save,
perhaps, a stale egg or two, and a few decayed apples. And when the
º, of Billingsgate fail, why not resort to the weapons of the
pillory
T H E S N O BS OF E N G LAN D.
BY ONE OF THEMSELVES,
CHAPTER XIV.-ON UNIVERSITY SNOBS.
Ll the men of Saint Boniface
will recognise HUGBY and CRUMP
in these two pictures. They
were tutors in our time, and
CRUMP is since advanced to be
- President of the College. He
was formerly, and is now, a rich
specimen of a University Snob.
At five-and-twenty, CRUMP
invented three new metres, and
published an edition of an ex-
ceedingly improper Greek Co-
medy, with no less than twenty
emendations upon the German
text of SCHNUPFENIUs and
SchNAPsi Us. These services to
religion instantly pointed him
out for advancement in the
Church, and he is now President
of St. Boniface, and very nar-
rowly escaped the bench.
CRUMP thinks St. Boniface the centre of the world, and his
position as President, the highest in England. He expects the fellows
and tutors to pay him the same sort of service that Cardinals pay to
the Pope. I am sure CRAwley would have no objection to carry his
trencher, or PAGE to hold up the skirts of his gown as he stalks into
chapel. He roars out the responses there as if it were an honour to
heaven, that the President of St. Boniface should take a part in the
service, and in his own lodge and college acknowledges the Sovereign
only as his superior.
When the allied monarchs came down, and were made Doctors of
the University, a breakfast was given at St. Boniface; on which occa-
sion CRUMP allowed the EMPERoR ALExANDER to walk before him,
but took the pas himself of the KING of PRussia and PRINCE BLUchER.
He was going to put the Hetman PLAToff to breakfast at a side-table
with the under college-tutors ; but he was induced to relent, and
merely entertained that distinguished Cossack with a discourse on his
own language, in which he showed that the Hetman knew nothing
about it. |
As for us undergraduates, we scarcely knew more about CRUMP
than about the Grand Lama. A few favoured youths are asked
occasionally to tea at the lodge . but they do not speak unless first
addressed by the Doctor ; and if they venture to sit down, CRUMP's
follower, MR. ToADY, whispers, “Gentlemen, will you have the kind-
ness to get up 7–The President is passing ; ” or, “Gentlemen, the
President prefers that under-graduates should not sit down; ” or words
to a similar effict.
To do CRUMP justice, he does not cringe now to great people. He
rather patronises them than otherwise ; and, in London, speaks quite |
affably to a Duke who has been brought up at his college, or holds out
a finger to a Marquis. He does not disguise his own origin, but brags
of it with considerable self-gratulation : —“I was a Charity-boy,”
says he “see what I am now ; the greatest Greek scholar of the
greatest College of the greatest University of the greatest Empire in
the world.” The argument being, that this is a capital world for beg-
gars, because he, being a beggar, has managed to get on horseback.
HUGBY owes his eminence to patient merit and agreeable persever-
ance. He is a meek, mild, inoffensive creature, with just enough of
scholarship to fit him to hold a lecture, or set an examination paper. He
rose by kindness to the aristocracy. It was wonderful to see the way
in which that poor creature grovelled before a nobleman or a lord's
nephew, or even some noisy and disreputable commoner, the friend of
a lord. He used to give the young noblemen the most painful and
elaborate breakfasts, and adopt a jaunty genteel air, and talk with
them (although he was decidedly serious) about the opera, or the last
run with the hounds. It was good to watch him in the midst of a
circle of young tufts, with his mean, smiling, eager, uneasy familiarity.
He used to write home confidential letters to their parents, and made
it his duty to call upon them when in town, to condole or rejoice with
them when a death, birth, or marriage took place in their family ; and
to feast them whenever they came to the University. I recollect a

letter lying on a desk in his lecture-room for a whole term, beginning,
“My Lord Duke.” It was to show us that he corresponded with such
dignities.
When the late lamented LoRD GLENLIVAT, who broke his neck at a
hurdle-race, at the premature age of twenty-four, was at the Univer-
sity, the amiable young fellow, passing to his rooms in the early
morning, and seeing HUGBY's boots at his door, on the same staircase,
playfully wadded the insides of the boots with cobbler's wax, which
caused excruciating pains to the Rev. MR. Hugby, when he came to
take them off the same evening, before dining with the Master of
St. Crispin's.
Everybody gave the credit of this admirable piece of fun to LoRD
GLENLIVAT's friend, Bob Tizzy, who was famous for such feats, and
who had already made away with the College pump-handle; filed
St. Bon IFACE's nose smooth with his face ; carried off four images of
nigger-boys from the tobacconists; painted the senior proctor's horse
pea-green, &c., &c.; and Bob (who was of the party certainly, and
would not peach) was just on the point of incurring expulsion, and so
losing the family living which was in store for him, when GLENLIvat
nobly stepped forward, owned himself to be the author of the delight-
ful jeu d'esprit, apologised to the tutor, and accepted the rustication.
HUGBY cried when GLENLIvaT apologised ; if the young nobleman
had kicked him round the court, I believe the tutor would have been
happy, so that an apology and a reconciliation might subsequently ensue.
“My lord,” said he, “in your conduct on this and all other occasions,
you have acted as becomes a gentleman; you have been an honour
to the University, as you will be to the peerage, I am sure, when the
amiable vivacity of youth is calmed down, and you are called upon to
take your proper share in the government of the nation.” And when
his lordship took leave of the University, HUGBY presented him a
copy of his “Sermons to a Nobleman's Family” (HUGBY was once
private tutor to the sons of the EARL of MUFFBorough) which
GLENLIvat presented in return to MR. WILLIAM RAMM, known to the
fancy as the Tutbury Pet, and the sermons now figure on the
boudoir-table of MRs. RAMM, behind the bar of her house of enter-
tainment, “The Game Cock and Spurs,” near Woodstock, Oxon.
At the beginning of the long vacation, HUGBY comes to town, and
puts up in handsome lodgings near Saint James's Square; rides in the
Park in the afternoon ; and is delighted to read his name in the
morning papers among the list of persons present at Muffborough
House, and the MARQUIs of FARINTosh's evening parties.

all the week, file down High Street,_sometimes, I say, you may see
HUGBY coming out of the Church of Saint Giles-in-the-Fields, with a
stout gentlewoman leaning on his arm, whose oldface bears an expression
of supreme pride and happiness as she glances round at all the neigh-
bours, and who faces the Curate himself, and marches into Holborn,
where she pulls the bell of a house, over which is inscribed, “HUGBY,
HABERDAsHER.” It is the mother of the REv. F. Hugby, as proud of
her son in his white choker as CoRNELIA of her jewels at Rome.
That is old HUGBY bringing up the rear with the Prayer-books, and
BETSY HUGBY, the old maid, his daughter, old HUGBY, Haberdasher
and Churchwarden.
In the front room up stairs, where the dinner is laid out, there is a
picture of Muffborough Castle; of the EARL of MUFFBorough, K.Y.,
Lord Lieutenant for Diddlesex ; an engraving from an Almanac of
St. Boniface College, Oxon. ; and a sticking-plaister portrait of HUGBY
when young in a cap and gown. A copy of his Sermons to a Noble-
man's Family is on the book-shelf by the “Whole Duty of Man,” the
Reports of the Missionary Societies, and the Oxford University
Calendar. Old HUGBY knows part of this by heart ; every living
belonging to Saint Boniface, and the name of every tutor, fellow
nobleman, and undergraduate.
He used to go to meeting and preach himself, until his son took
orders ; but of late the old gentleman has been accused of Puseyism,
and is quite pitiless against the Dissenters.

“The best of claret is, that You MAY DRINK any

(hic) quantity
QIje 3Library of the 33ritigi) ſºugeum.
WE remember being told by the Penny Magazine, when we were in a
very green youth, which is a much greener condition than a green old
age, that we ought to take particular pride in the British Museum ;
because, being public property, it belonged to us as much as to anybody.
What is everyone's business is no one's business, and what is every-
one's property is no one's property; and the result is, that no one
looks after it. The fearful mismanagement of the British Museum is
thus accounted for.
We must admit that we never contemplated the idea of entering the
British Museum and pocketing a few of the prepared beetles, or
sending a man for some of the Elgin Marbles, as, if the concern were
our own, we should have a proper right to do; but we, in sober reality,
think it hard that if we are the rightful owners of a share in the
British Museum, so little is done to accommodate us in that establish-
ment.
The Library, to which the public has a perfect right to resort, is so
beset with difficulties, that there is scarcely any possibility of enjoying
its advantages; the only persons one can get any communication with
whatever, are the beadle who stands at the gate, and the underlings
who fetch and carry the volumes from the book-shelves. There is a
MR. PANIzzi who keeps the printed books, and who seems to be of a
facetious turn of mind, which causes him to enjoy as a joke the
dilemma in which the frequenters of the Library are placed by the bad
arrangement of the establishment.
A printed catalogue has been suggested by the Trustees, and a manu-
script copy has accordingly been commenced, but as it promised to be
almost as long in hand as the houses of Parliament, MR. PANIzzi has
been asked when it is likely to be completed. He coolly, and with an
air of bland satisfaction, replies that in 1854 there may be a written
list of all the printed books received up to the year 1838, but he begs
to say, in addition, that there are no means by which the business can
be forwarded.
Gaining no attention to our complaints from the book-carriers, we
go to MistER PANIzzi, who derides us with civil intimations of the
hopelessness of our complaints; and we, therefore, naturally turn for
consolation to the Trustees of the British Museum. Of these there
are forty-eight, and at the head of the list stand the ARchbishop of
CANTERBURY, and the Lord CHANCELLoR. Fancy our rushing down
to Lambeth Palace to insist on reparation from the primate, for having
experienced difficulty in getting a book in the reading-room of the
| British Museum. Imagine our presenting ourselves in the Court of
Chancery, and demanding justice for some wrong we had experienced
at the hands of PAN1zzi.
The Speaker of the House of Commons, too, as if he, poor man, had
not his head full enough of the debates, is a trustee, ex officio, of the
great national establishment, that can't get a catalogue. It is true SIR
John HERscuel is a trustee ; but he is too much absorbed in the con-
templation of the great book of nature to attend to the classification of
the millions of volumes that fill our national book-shelves. PANIzzi is,
after all, the only accessible person, and PANIzzi sits, simply laughing
in his sleeve at the embarrassment he sees the public suffering.
If the regular Museum authorities cannot make a catalogue, we are
quite sure that GEORGE Robins would lend a hand upon so great an
emergency. It may be objected, that the individual alluded to has
devoted himself rather to the poetry than to the plain matter-of-fact
of his profession. But what of that ? HomeR was not above drawing
up a catalogue of the ships; and we are convinced that GEORGE
RoBINs will not refuse to try his hand upon a catalogue of the printed
books in the British Museum.

whether she would be well enough to sing that evening ; but after
dinner, the Signora suddenly rallied, and the bills—which LA Fiang-

talented cantatrici was dangerously ill were preserved for another
occasion.
SIGNoF VERMICELLI, owing to an accident in an omnibus, in which
his foot was twice trodden upon, could not dance as the Third Brigand

to omit her pas seul across the flies, as one of the Willis in La Giselle,
owing to her right shoe pinching her, upon which subject this danseuse,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OH, let me try and recollect, if anyhow I may,
The hurry, scurry, worry, flurry, of the Derby Day.
There's first the being woke at six, in temper rather surly,
In order to be up and down for all the early burly.
There's breakfast waiting ; but of course you've got no time to eat it;
A message says, the carriage waits, and you must run to meet it.
You're off, and just arrive in time to find your friends debating
What right have you especially, to keep the rest all waiting 2
There's then a precious piece of work to get you to your places;
P'rhaps on an iron rail you're perch'd, to travel to the races.
You're off at last, when o'er a stone perchance the carriage passes,
To a running accompaniment of wine and broken glasses.
But very soon you all agree 'tis useless to complain ;
So on you go, and lay the dust with sherry and champagne.
To shun the crowd, a quiet road perchance you've made selection of,
Which the two post-boys can't at all find out the right direction of ;
And so they gallop you about, over the self-same ground,
Until you go a circuit where you're never gaining ground.
At length, when for an hour or so you've wander'd quite astray,
You see a line of vehicles which points you out your way.
You join the throng, and get behind some snob who will insist on
Playing all sorts of tunes upon a Cornet call'd a Piston.
Your basket of provisions wins you many a vulgar laugh ;
Your horses too are treated with an extra feed of chaft.
You stop awhile to bait them, in the groom's peculiar way,
Rubbing their tender noses with a whisp of moistened hay.
There's something in a whisp of hay—when wet—that I suppose is
A glorious specific for all equestrian noses.
It may be for a horse's snout a tonic very fine,
I only know I shouldn't like that sort of thing for mine.
Away you go, until you near the horrid turnpike gate,
When you're compelled to slacken much your ordinary rate.
And every one is bent upon the mad, ambitious prank,
Of getting very far before those of his proper rank.
But now, arrived upon the Downs, I'll not exhaust my force)
In a description of a sight that's quite a thing of course.
How one, upon the Derby Day, from Epsom does return,
Is often 'midst the mysteries one can't contrive to learn.
On looking at my coat and boots next day, I felt, I trust,
That pleasure is but vanity, and man is only Dust 1
THE “WELLED" OF EPSOM.
As the summer is setting in, it will by no means surprise us—after
what we saw on the Derby day—if MR. TYLER, to protect the com-
plexion of his rhinoceros, should hang before its countenance a fine
Mechlin web of lace ; for some hundred or two individuals in the mas-
of blue and green tastefully bound about their hats. Some folks, how-
ever, declared that they were not men, but nuns from Bermondsey, out
on a frolic ; whilst others averred that the veiled were unfortunate
individuals who, fearing to meet their creditors, wore coloured rags to
hide their debtor faces.

Accident on the Derby Day.
THE Umbrella, which is now performing at the Adelphi, met with an
serious consequences. It seems that it went to the Derby, but re-
turning home, it was thrown out of its carriage, and had two of its ribs
broken, besides being dreadfully bruised about the nozzle, and injured
in the head. It was carried immediately to an adjoining Hospital for
culine habit were seen upon the way to and from the course, with veils
accident on Wednesday last, which might have been attended with
Umbrellas, in Maiden Lane, to have its ribs reset, and was recovered
just in time to make its appearance before an apology had been made
for its indisposition.
TO MILITARY IMPOSTORS.
Found, on the Epsom Race-Course, a pair of moustaches. They
are of a dark colour, and turned up at each end. The proprietor
can have them by sending his name and address to the Punch Oſſice.”

THE BERKSHIRE LIBELLER.
THE Berkshire Chronicle complains that we have handed him over to
the Attorney-General for a libel on the Queen—
“in stating that the Royal apartments at Windsor were to be closed to the public.
Now Punch is rather hard upon us in the matter, inasmuch as we never connected Hra
MAJESTY's name with the order.”
Now this is sneaking and shabby. What was the inference 2 If
the Royal apartments were closed, could it be by any other than HER
Majesty's order Could such a mandate issue from the Windsor
housekeeper ? Yet now would the Berkshire Arcadian shuffle from the
Consequences of the libel. This smacks of poltroonery. It would have
ºen handsomer to confess the blunder, and promise better behaviour.
The truthful Chronicle also observes—
“Her Majesty has long since excluded punch from every one of her palaces, but

BROUGHAM WOOL-GATHERING.
Lond CAMPBELL has twitted Brough AM for “ sitting upon the corner

MARK ANTONY RICHMOND ON THE BODY OF
PROTECTION.
“DUREs, Barons, Noblemen, lend me your ears;
I come to bury, not to praise, Protection.
The evil that laws do lives after them.;
The good is oft interred with repeal.
So be it with Protection. Good SIR Robert
Hath said Protection was iniquitous :
If it were so, it were a grievous fault,
And grievously she now hath answer'd it.
Here, under leave of Robert and the rest,
For Robert is an honourable man,
(So are they all, all honourable men;)
—Oh, very l—speak I in her funeral.
She was my friend, liberal and kind to me;
But Robert says she was iniquitous,
And Robert is an honourable man.
She hath kept many tenants on your lands,
Whose rents did your good Lordships' incomes swell ;
Did this in her appear iniquitous *
She, whilst the poor have starved, hath made you fat—
Iniquity is of more levelling stuff.
Yet Robert says she was iniquitous,
And he's—oh, yes l—an honourable man.
You all did love her once, not without cause ;
What cause withheld you, then, to vote for her?
Oh sharpness, thou art fled to vulgar Snobs,
And Lords have lost their gumption —Bear with me;
My heart is in my coffers with Protection,
And I Inust pause till it come back to me. *
*
If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.—
You all do know this statute : I remember
The first time ever RIP on brought it in,
That time that he was MR. Robinson.
Look, in this place ran CoBDEN's weapon through :
See, what a cut the envious WILLIERs made :
Through this the well-beloved Robert stabb'd,
And as he pluck'd his sliding-scale away,
Mark how Protection's life-blood followed it ;
As rushing out of doors, to be resolv’d
If Robert so unkindly knock'd or no,
(For, you know, Robert was Protection's angel)
Judge, oh you Lords, how tenderly she lov'd !
This was the most unkindest cut of all :
For when the fair Protection saw him stab,
Inconstancy, more strong than Leaguer's wiles,
Quite vanquish'd her : then burst her mighty heart;
And in her polka muffling up her face,
Ev’n at the base of CANNING's statue,
Which all the while ran blood, Protection fell !
Oh I what a do was there, my noblemen
Then you, and I, and all of us, were done,
Whilst Free-Trade treason flourish'd over us.
Oh I now you weep, and I perceive you see
How the cat jumpeth : these are feeling drops.
Kind Lords, what! weep you when you but behold
Protection's statute riddled ? Look you here,
Here i. herself, burk'd, as you see, by traitor. !
*
Good Lords, sweet Lords, let me not stir you up
To any sudden flood of mutiny.
They that have done this deed are honourable,
(Over the left);-their private ends I know not ;
I am no actor, as Robert is :
But, as you know me all, a dull blunt duke—
For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech
To stir men's blood. But were I Robert PEEL,
And PEEL were RichMoRD, then there were a RICHMOND
Would rub your spirit up, and put a tongue
In each wound of Protection, that should move,
The House of Lords to rise and mutiny.”
ANOTHER BAD ONE.

AN ECONOMICAL MODE OF PUTTING TROOI’s INTo Wiiite TROWSERs.
A WORD ON THE MAY-MEETINGS.
PUNCH is not popular in Exeter Hall. If he were to present himself upon the platform, as a practical
philanthropist, pious ladies would faint, evangelical chairmen break out into unholy passions, and
Punch would be hustled by indignant piety down the steps among the pickpockets, who are practising
their vocation in the crowd outside.
He knows this, and deeply, sincerely regrets it. He has more sympathy with what goes on in May-
meetings than Exeter Hall would be likely to give him credit for.
Punch is anxious for the good of his fellows. He has not been a street-wanderer for nothing. He
knows a good deal, he flatters himself, about the endurances, enjoyments, frailties, follies, vices, virtues,
self-denials, and selfishnesses of the poor. He is anxious to correct the bad, and to set forth and aid the
good round about him. He ventures, on this score, to claim a brotherhood with Exeter Hall.
But still there are differences between him and it, viewed by him calmly and not uncharitably.
Does Exeter Hall think it possible that Punch and the May-meetingers could be made to understand each
other ?
Punch, it is true, teaches by laughter and wears motley. Exeter Hall dresses its charity in grave looks
and black coats. But Punch's grin may cover thoughts as solemn as a drawn-down lip and a dead
eye. His parti-coloured doublet has a heart under it as penetrable, as sympathetic, and as large as
that which beats under the Rev. JABEz BLANK's raven broadcloth, or DR. ANoNYMoUs's sable cassock.
Punch has his peculiar theories of social improvements, like Exeter Hall, but his own strike him as
the wider. He believes in the proverb, that “Charity begins at home,” though it by no means ends
there. Exeter Hall, on the contrary, seems to think that Charity begins abroad, and that it should
keep its pockets buttoned till it crosses the line. Punch has no doubt that the heathen are in a horri-
ble state of darkness and depravity. Exemplary missionaries assure him of the fact ; and, moreover,
that they have the greatest difficulty in convincing benighted but jolly Fejeeans that they are miserable
sinners. But his eyes have taught him the existence of a deeper heathenism and a more benighted
savageness lying round about us—the heathenism of untrained vice and the savageness of degraded
civilisation.
Suppose, besides its Pastoral Aid Societies and its Scripture Readers, Exeter Hall were to turn the
stream of its benevolence—its millions of money, and its thousands of agents, for a year or two,
through our own towns and hamlets; suppose the Bible Society were to sink its Foreign labours for a
while, and to constitute itself a Society for the Education of the Poor—to multiply our Ragged Schools
by ten thousand, and increase their efficiency and scope in the same ratio 2 What if the propagators
of the Gospel were to look at home, and begin propagating the Gospel lessons of peace on earth and good-
will towards men—to carry on, in short, the lessons of which their great Founder sowed the seeds and
left the record 2
What if some dozen of Societies, now ready to tear each other in pieces from sheer excess of Chris-
tian zeal, were to lump their activity and intentions into a great Metropolitan Social Improvement
Union, to go on step by step with the Metropolitan Buildings' Improvement Commissioners ? The
latter pull down the hovels of the poor to build up houses for the respectable ; why should not the
proposed Society set to work to build up comfortable dwellings for the wretched who are thus dis-
placed 7 What if, abandoning for a while their exclusive faith in tracts, they were to throw their
energies into baths and wash-houses, and prepare the human vessel for receiving the purified contents
they wish to pour into it 2
The zealous for Christian education might combine to supersede those present unsatisfactory school-
masters, the prison and the gallows. Saffron Hill and the Rookery lie nearer home than Caffraria and
the Marquesas Islands. The mission-
aries to the savage and heathen dis-
tricts of London would not have far to
travel, and, short of cannibalism, would
meet with every variety of evil habit
to amend, and every degree of igno-
rance to enlighten. They would have
abundance of discouragement, and
enough of disappointment to satisfy
the zeal of a St. VINCENT, St. PAUL,
or a HENRY MARTYN. If not roasted
at the stake, they would be roasted in
slang, and the progress of their labours
would becalculable by something more
trustworthy than missionary letters,
and marked by more cheering results
than MAsheboo's giving up his taste
for gold, or RAUPARAHU's solemnly
putting away eleven of his twelve
wives. We throw out these hints to
the May-meetings in the best spirit
of co-operation, and remain, their bro-
ther in all good works, though they

LEGAL FASHIONS.
THE recent fracas on the subject
of forensic head-dresses, in the Court
of Exchequer, has drawn attention
generally to the subject of legal fash-
ions ; and a barrister's Belle Assemblée,
or Petit Courier d'Halle de Westminster,
is very generally talked about.
One of the newest things we have
lately seen in forensic evening dress,
is the bar gown, and a cigar in the
mouth, for after-dinner promenade in
the Temple Gardens. The dispute in
the Church, as to “Who is to wear
the gown, and when 7" has been vir-
tually answered by a legal exquisite,
who, rushing out of his chambers,
exclaimed, “Who is to wear the gown,
and when, forsooth 2 Why, I'll wear
it now.” And his example has since
been followed by several of the legal
fraternity. The Temple Gardens
every evening exhibit various patterns
of this style of costume. In the way
of collars, the rusty black is found to
predominate.
FRENCH GLORY.
THE Journaldes Débats, dilating upon
the reception given to IBRAHIM PASHA
by the Parisians, says —
“Among the shouts which welcomed him, he
might have heard more than once the name
NEzin; in the matter of glory the French Do
Nor stav To ExAMINE, but applaud whenever
it is brought under their eyes.”
Awfully true this. For the French
judge of glory as men judge of a black-
pudding—by the quantity of the ma-
terial that goes to its manufacture.
Hence, the greater the slaughter, the
greater the glory; the more the blood,
the bigger the pudding.

FAMILY MATHEMATICS.
- ELovED PUNCH,-I am a
Mathematician, and have
the misfortune to be
married. The great pro-
blem which I have con-
tinually to work out, is to
describe from my pocket,
as a centre, a circle of
expenditure that shall be
contained within the
limits of my means.
My wife yesterday wanted
a new shawl, or rather
desired it, for she did
liot want it, having a
very good one already.
We had just arranged a
trip to Brighton, which,
with the contingent ex-
penses, I had calculated
would cost us two pounds
ten, which was all the
money I could afford.
The price of the shawl
was one guinea. Now, Sir, I wished to demonstrate to MRs. PUMPKIN
the following proposition :-
“If the price of a shawl be one guinea, and the expense of a trip to
Brighton be two pounds ten ; and if two pounds ten be all the money
I can afford, then, if I buy my wife the shawl, I cannot afford to take
her a trip to Brighton ; or, if I take the trip to Brighton, then I can-
not afford to buy her the shawl.
“‘Let A,” I began, “be a given shawl.'
“‘Exactly so, interrupted my wife.

“‘Pooh 1” said I. ‘Pray attend, and hear me out.
guinea, and let the shawl. A be equal to the guinea, B.’
“‘It’s equal to more than a guinea ; worth one pound five at least,'
cried MRs. PUMPKIN.
“‘Nonsense !” I said.
“Give it to me; that's just
Let B be one
“Let a trip to Brighton be CD, and two
pounds ten shillings be EF. Let CD be equal to EF, and let EF
be as much as I can afford. Now, because A is cqual to B, and
CD to EF; therefore ACD are equal to BEF. Wherefore, if I pur-
chase A, I cannot also afford CD ; because A CD are equal to BEF,
and I can only afford E.F. Much less, if I am to go to the expense of
CD, am I able likewise to incur that of A ; for CD is equal to EF,
which is the utmost that I can afford ; wherefore, if I spend the whole
EF, equal to CD, I shall have nothing at all left where with to pur-
chase A. Wherefore I shall be able to afford nothing for A ; wherefore
I shall not be able to afford B; unless it be said that B is nothing,
which is absurd.”
“‘B is nothing,” said my wife.
B 2 Surely a guinea is nothing.’
“It was of no use. I bought the shawl, and we are to go to Brighton.
Where the money is to come from, I don't know. I suppose I must
borrow the needful £1 9s. But I wish, Mr. Punch, you would exert
your influence to cause ladies to be instructed in Mathematics.

A Blow at the Legislature.
WE really cannot see what reason there can possibly exist for going
to any expense at all about the Ventilation of the Houses of Parliament.
The Members might be their own ventilators, for most of them are
fearfully long-winded.
DREADFUL REVENGE.
FRoºt the way in which the Protectionists keep talking about the

THE HERNE BAY SEASON,
ENORMoUs exertions are being made to get up an excitement at
Herne Bay; and, in the hope of bringing visitors by a whirl of fascina-
tion which shall allure them as it were into a vortex of gaiety, a com-
mittee has actually been formed to attempt an engagement of the
German green-baize band, with which all the little boys who run after
itinerant musicians in London are perfectly familiar. We have
positively seen a printed notice, signed by a doctor of medicine, and
entreating the inhabitants of the Bay to aid “a Committee of resident
gentlemen,” who have “proposed the engagement of the German
Band” as “an agreeable recreation for the visitors.”
We must admire the native spirit of the Bay, which has ventured
even to contemplate so bold a speculation as the engagement of a street
band ; a measure only second in energy to the gigantic outlay incurred
in securing the two celebrated artists on stilts, for a summer day's fete
at Rosherville.
The notice issued to the inhabitants of the Bay is so rich, that we
can scarcely resist the temptation to print it entire. We, at all events,
must indulge our readers with a few extracts.
“The Committee have determined to use the utmost exertion to provide such attrac-
tion as they hope will induce the visitors to prolong the season to the latest period.
Should the fund collected in the first instance be in proportion to the responsibility, the
Band will commence their engagement about the 10th of June.”
We literally start at the magnificence of the idea, that the season is
likely to be “prolonged to the latest period,” by visitors remaining to
hear, to the very last moment, the German green-baize band, with which
they have probably been bored nearly to death before quitting the me-
tropolis. We wonder what fund can be necessary to secure the services
of those good folks, who are generally satisfied with a saucerful of
coppers, or a thin layer of the same precious metal in the interior of a
hat, for each of their performances. The idea of the “responsibility”
incurred by the whole Bay is absurd ; for one might as well talk of the
responsibility attaching to the mob of idlers and juveniles who gather
round the German green-baize band on the ordinary occasions of their
performance. If the inhabitants do not cash up liberally, let us mark
the sad reverse of the picture of prosperity which the projectors of
this scheme have drawn so glowingly.
“But if the sum collected fall short of the prospect of success, the subscriptions will
be at once returned ; as it appears to the Committee wholly useless to enter into such an
engagement in the hope that the visitors alone should support them.”
The Committee dare do all that does become a Committee ; but evi-
dently dare not incur the risk of an engagement with a party of street
musicians. “That the visitors alone should support them,” is at once
rejected as a hopeless matter, for we believe that an Italian hurdy-
gurdy boy can scarcely make his fortune out of the Bay in the height
of the so-called season.
We understand, however, that if the experiment succeeds, the Com-
mittee will next year offer an engagement to SIGNOR GERoNIMo SAR-
Tone and his highly-trained monkey, for a series of performances, ac-
companied on the organ by the Signor himself, who is a great favourite
in the suburbs of the Metropolis. We cannot conclude better than by
quoting the following paragraph, which repudiates the idea of “exclu-
siveness” in their musical “arrangements :"—
“The Committee purpose that the Band shall perform at each end of the Bay daily,
so that the Subscribers shall have no reason to complain of any exclusiveness in the
arrangements.”
Those, however, who don't happen to like a street band dinning in
their ears, will positively have no escape if this method is adopted.

We intend competing at the next Exhibition of the result of British
Industry, and propose to forward models of two locomotives, each of
which is singularly adapted
to the present fashionable
modes of railway travelling.
The one called the Tor-

accommodation of the poorer
class of travellers, whom it
is desirable to keep upon
the road as many hours as

EATING-MATCH EXTRAORDINARY.
A GRAND eating-match has been for some time going on between the
Courts of Chancery and Aldermen ; the contest being which of the two
Courts shall devour the largest number of charities. Some may object
to this harmless pastime; but one great object of charity is the feeding
of the hungry ; and who can be more hungry than Aldermen, except
lawyers ?
Betting, at the outset, was two to one upon the Aldermen, whose
long-established reputation for prowess at the table had created a
prestige in their favour; and one bold speculator was heard to declare
that he would back them to eat up every charity in England in a
twelvemonth.
Their Worships have certainly been doing pretty well. 'Tis not in
Aldermen, or any other mortals, to command success; but they have
done more, as the poet, says, they have deserved it; having assuredly
spared no exertion to justify the reliance which has been placed upon
them by their backers. At one bout, which not long ago came off at
Greenwich, a small, but determined band of civic champions disposed
of whitebait, stewed, collared, and spitchcocked eels, Thames flounders,
salmon in some half-a-dozen shapes, mackarel in about as many, carp,
tench, turbot, and lobster-sauce, in all about thirty dishes of fish ; the
whole forming a most formidable array of the finny race.
They next got over, or through, a phalanx of strong pièces de résistance,
consisting of shoulders, breasts, and cutlets of lamb, roast and boiled
fowls, ducks, goslings, hams, tongues, sweetbreads, fricandeaux, curries,
and other substantials, to the amount of some forty dishes, not to
mention a numerous force of patties and such light auxiliaries; after
which they set-to with a relay of tarts, cheese-cakes, Charlotte-Russes,
creams, jellies, and custards; all of which, with their accompanying
condiments and vegetables, they utterly cut up and despatched. Un.
wearied with these efforts, they manfully returned to the charge, and
did signal execution upon grapes, pine-apples, almonds and raisins, figs,
prunes, oranges, confections, and sweets ; converting, in an incredibly
short time, a dessert into a desert. In the mean time, they completely
absorbed a whole cellar, in iced punch, Champagne, Hock, Sauterne,
Madeira, Port, Sherry, Claret, Seltzer and Soda Water, French brandy,
and liqueurs. This astonishing feat, unparalleled in any other annals of
deglutition than the civic, was crowned by the demolition of an im-
mense pile of muffins and crumpets, and a proportionate number of
vessels of tea and coffee; with all of which under their waistcoats they
returned triumphantly to town. Our bold citizens thus, at one sitting,
ate up about 90l., or the interest of a charity of 3000l. sterling, funded
property.
| Wonderful, however, as was this achievement, it has been eclipsed
by the exploits of the Court of Chancery ; which possesses a width of
throat and a capacity of stomach which defy all competition. By reason
of these natural advantages, Chancery is enabled to do that at one
gulp which it would take the Aldermen many dinners to accomplish.
In a single suit it has swallowed up from 300l. to 500l. charitable trust
property, as a mere morsel; and its barristers and clerks have bolted,
in fees, the bagatelle or kickshaw of 20l. or 30l. at a time, and thought
nothing of it. So that the odds in this eating-match are now in favour
of the Court of Chancery; for though the Aldermen have eaten large
holes in charities, Chancery has swallowed them entire.

THE SNOBS OF ENGLAND.
BY one of The MSELVES.
CHAP. XV.-ON UNIVERSITY SNOBS.
I should like to fill several volumes with accounts of various Uni-
versity Snobs; so fond are my reminiscences of them, and so numerous
are they. I should like to speak, above all, of the wives and daugh-
ters of some of the Professor-Snobs ; their amusements, habits,
jealousies; their innocent artifices to entrap young men ; their
pic-nics, concerts, and evening parties. I wonder what has become
of EMILY BLADEs, daughter of BLADEs the Professor of the Mandingo
language 2 I remember her shoulders to this day, as she sate in the
midst of a crowd of about seventy young gentlemen, from Corpus and
Catharine Hall, entertaining them with ogles and French songs on the
guitar. Are you married, fair EMILY of the shoulders ? What beau-
tiful ringlets those were that used to dribble over them l—what a
waist —what a killing sea-green shot-silk gown l—what a cameo, the
size of a muffin | There were thirty-six young men of the Univer-
sity in love at one time with EMILY BLADEs : and no words are suffi-
cient to describe the pity, the sorrow, the deep, deep commiseration—
the rage, fury, and uncharitableness, in other words—with which the
Miss TRUMPs (daughter of TRUMPs, the Professor of Phlebotomy)
regarded her, because she didn't squint, and because she wasn't marked
with the small-pox.
As for the young University Snobs, I am getting too old, now, to
speak of such very familiarly. My recollections of them lie in the
far, far past—almost as far back as PELHAM's time.
We then used to consider Snobs, raw-looking lads, who never missed
chapel ; who wore high-lows and no straps ; who walked two hours
on the Trumpington road every day of their lives ; who carried off the
College scholarships, and who overrated themselves in hall. We were
premature in pronouncing our verdict of youthful Snobbishness. The
man without straps fulfilled his destiny and duty. He eased his old
Governor, the Curate in Westmoreland, or helped his sisters to set up
the Lady's School. He wrote a Dictionary, or a Treatise on Conic
Sections, as his nature and genius prompted. He got a fellowship :
and then took to himself a wife, and a living. He presides over a
parish now, and thinks it rather a dashing thing to belong to the
Oxford and Cambridge Club ; and his parishioners love him, and snore
under his sermons. No, no, he is not a Snob. It is not straps that
make the gentleman, or high-lows that unmake him, be they ever so |
thick. My son, it is you who are the Snob if you lightly despise a
man for doing his duty, and refuse to shake an honest man's hand
because it wears a Berlin glove.
* - We then used to consider it not the least vulgar for a parcel of lads
who had been whipped three months previous, and were not allowed
more than three glasses of port at home, to sit down to pine-apples
and ices at each others' rooms, and fuddle themselves with Champagne
and Claret.
One looks back to what was called “a wine-party” with a sort of
wonder. Thirty lads round a table covered with bad sweetmeats,
drinking bad wines, telling bad stories, singing bad songs over and
over again. Milk punch—smoking—ghastly headache—frightful
spectacle of dessert table next morning, and smell of tobacco—your
guardian, the clergyman, dropping in in the midst of this—expecting
to find you deep in Algebra, and discovering the Gyp administering
soda-water.
There were young men who despised the lads who indulged in the
coarse hospitalities of wine-parties, and prided themselves in giving
récherchés little French dinners. Both wine-party-givers and dinner-
givers were Snobs.
There were what used to be called “dressy" Snobs :—JIMMY, who
might be seen at five o'clock elaborately rigged out, with a camellia in
his button-hole, glazed boots, and fresh kid gloves twice a day —
JEssamy, who was conspicuous for his “jewellery,”—a young donkey,
glittering all over with chains, rings, and shirtstuds ;-JACKY, who
rode every day solemnly on the Blenheim Road, in pumps and white
silk stockings, with his hair curled,—all three of whom flattered them-
selves they gave laws to the University about dress—all three most
odious varieties of Snobs.
Sporting Snobs of course there were, and are always—those happy
beings in whom Nature has implanted a love of slang : who loitered
about the horsekeeper's stables, and drove the London coaches—a
stage in and out, and might be seen swaggering through the courts
in pink of early mornings, and indulged in dice and blind-hookey at
races, and kept bull-terriers. Worse Snobs even than these were poor
miserable wretches, who did not like hunting at all, and could not
afford it, and were in mortal fear at a two-foot ditch ; but who hunted
because GLENLIvat and CINQBARs hunted. The Billiard Snob and the
|Boating Snob were varieties of these, and are to be found elsewhere
than in Universities.
Then there were Philosophical Snobs, who used to ape statesmen at
the Spouting Clubs, and who believed as a fact, that Government
always had an eye on the University where to select orators for the
House of Commons. There were audacious young Free-thinkers, who
adored nobody or nothing, except perhaps RobespierRE and the
Koran, and panted for the day when the pale name of priest should
shrink and dwindle away before the indignation of an enlightened
world.
But the worst of all University Snobs, are those unfortunates who
go to rack and ruin from their desire to ape their betters. SMITH
becomes acquainted with great people at College, and is ashamed of
his father the tradesman. Jones has fine acquaintances, and lives
after their fashion like a gay, free-hearted fellow as he is, and ruins
his father, and robs his sister's portion, and cripples his younger
brother's outset in life, for the pleasure of entertaining my lord, and
riding by the side of SIR John. And though it may be very good
fun for Robinson to fuddle himself at home as he does at College,
and to be brought home by the policeman he has just been trying to
knock down—think what fun it is for the poor old soul, his mother
7,
—the half-pay Captain's widow, who has been pinching herself all
her life long, in order that that jolly young fellow might have a Uni-
versity Education. -
Base Ingratitude.
At the grand review given at the Champ de Mars in honour of
IBRAHIM 'PACHA, there were repeated cries of “A bas les Anglais.”
The French certainly imagine that the English still rule in France ;
and yet we wonder at their forgetfulness, for our rule was very
different to Louis-PHILIPPE's. He is continually building fortifications
—whilst we invariably destroyed them.

BRITISH UNICORN.
MR PUNCH,
“You have made my companion,
the British Lion, very popular ; can you
do nothing for me? Understand, I shall
be well content with half the notoriety you
have bestowed upon my leonine friend; for,
certainly, since you have signalised him by

from the obscurity of the National Arms,
and discussed the length of his mane and

and the various modulations of his roar—
the poor beast has been worked and bela-
boured more than any costermonger's donkey.

and all these presumptuous men have flatly denied my right to the
graceful form made familiar by the Royal Arms to every true-born

and—it will be found—outraged unicorns will gore.
“Nevertheless, for myself, I could still endure the contempt and
slander of the world with perfect indifference. Yes, sir; I could hear
my companion, the British Lion, praised for his courage, his magna-
nimity, and every other after-dinner virtue—(though, between our-
selves, I hare known him guilty of certain rogueries and fooleries more
worthy of the British fox and the British goose; only lions, by virtue
of their claws, are privileged as occasional knaves and simpletons)—I
say, I could, unmoved, listen to his praises—unmoved as one opera-

the left by a worse than nothing—by a fiction l Now, sir, will you
urge Lord GEORGE BENTINCR to move for a committee to inquire into
the truth of the existence of the British Unicorn ? I suggest Lord

The publicity which has been given to the operations of “Mr.

assumed for the purpose of cheating under it. The patrician style of
man, too, will now become rather suspicious ; and hence the short and
squat swindler will have an advantage over the rogue who is tall and
shapely. For the same reason, the military cut, and the extremely
i." will be an ineligible costume for the seeker of a fraudulent live.
- |
The costume of the swindler may consist of a suit of black, made |
large and loose, with the hinder coat buttons very wide apart, and the
tail broad ; large, easy boots, and no straps to the trousers. To this |
may be added a white neckeloth ; but then it must be tied very negli-
gently, lest the wearer should be mistaken for a rector. Or the blue or
brown broadcloth coat, with brass buttons, and cord or drab shorts,
with gaiters, or top-boots, may be adopted, and a good addition will
be a buff waistcoat, diagonally traversed by a black ribbon, to the end
of which is to be attached an eye-glass. The hat should be broad-
brimmed; if white, with a green lining, all the better; the whiskers
grizzled, and shaved off where the base abuts on the shirt-collar. A
good stout cane, with a leather thong through the top of it, should be
carried in the hand; and the watch ought to be a hunting one, of large
size, and worn in the fob. To complete the illusion, a smack of the
Hampshire dialect, and a hearty laugh, will be desirable. For the name,
in lieu of MANNERs or CLINToN, the substitute should be MASTERMAN
or Collins. These are the colours that an adventurer should now sail
under, if his craft is to obtain money under false pretences.

THE present taste for monstrosities, in the two extremes of the
gigantic and the dwarf is, we are happy to say, rapidly diminishing.
The GENERAL ToM THUMB is obliged to resort to the cheap order
system, to fill his rooms, and an effort to get up a gigantic ox at the
Egyptian Hall has not proved very successful. "We had the pleasure
of a private audience of the ox, in Piccadilly one night, after exhibition
hours, as the brute was leisurely strolling home to its lodgings, after
the day's excitement. We fancied that we read in the poor creatures
sunken eye and melancholy brow the following impressive paragraph —
“Alas! what is fame 2 A bubble. And what am I, but beef?—a
victim hurrying towards the steak as rapidly as possible 2"
We could not help sympathising with the melancholy beast as the
driver of one of the Kensington Busses exclaimed, in the hearing of the
animal, and in a tone of irony that could scarcely be mistaken by the
most insensible of brutes, “I say, BILL, there's a precious shilling's
worth!” The dwarf cow, at the creature's side, who has been engaged
by way of contrast, looked miserably cowed at the glare of the gas-
lamps, and the row of the passing vehicles. It is a remarkable fact
that the translation of these animals into Latin would cause a fearful
case of misnomer, for it is the ox, and not the cow, that is the Whacker

a few years ago, began with 500l., and is now supposed to have 50,000l.’”
We take it, there is many a “house”—for the sneer implied in the
word is not to be mistaken—that could not give so truly noble a begin-
ning. How many “houses.” for instance, began with plunder—how

an animal, shut-up for the purpose of having ventilating experiments tried upon

Ex-Chancellor, imprisoned in an exhausted receiver, like one of those little figures
we have seen ascending and descending in a glass tube, according as the air was

WE met, 'twas in the House,
And I hoped he would shun me;
He came, I could not breathe,
For his tube was upon me.
He puff"d, the air was cold,
The thermometer alter'd :
I knew 'twas freezing point,
For my voice with shivering falter'd.
I wore my Russia ducks,

...A very salutary suggestion has been made by a cor-
respondent of the Times, that the puffers who avail them-
selves of advertising vans should be charged the regular
duty on their advertisements. Perhaps the better way
would be to have the vans themselves stamped; when
they might be free to circulate, like a newspaper, with all
their announcements throughout the metropolis. The hint
might, however, be improved upon by mixing amusing or
instructive matter with the advertisements posted on the
van ; which might carry an Editor inside to write leaders
on the passing events of the hour, which could be set up
in large type by a printer, also carried in the van, and
posted instantly by the bill-sticker, who is, we believe,
the capitalist or proprietor of these vehicles. A facile

IN the romantic account of PRINCE Louis NApoleoN's
escape from Ham, written by himself, occurs the following
passage :-
d “And after shaving off my moustaches, I took a plank on my shoul-

What must have been the feelings of Loris NApoleoN,
as a Prince and a young foreigner, at being forced to
shave off his moustaches History records many astound-
ing efforts made by heroes in escaping from captivity;
but nothing to match this. How could he have brought
himself to do it? We will adventure to say there is not a

our Alligators are looking up. They have been
considered dull, stupid wretches; but are now disco-
vered to have a world of light in them, when pro-
perly extracted and kindled : in a word, they are to
be killed for their oil. We have almost used up
whales, and shall now begin toº burn the midnight
alligator. An expedition has started from Montreal,
for Black Creek, for the fishery.-The writer says–
“You know how many of these enormous animals are shot out
of wantonness, from the decks of the steamboats that plough our
waters. I expect hereafter to hear of laws passed for their pro-
tection.” ---

# pare peasants, their wives and families, to our game,
our birds and partridges: why should not the folks
and so fatten them upon live Indians ? But this
will come. A sense of the value of alligators is
evidently gaining ground. º
“we must allow them to be killed only at a proper season, when th --

Thus, doubtless, there will be alligator preserves; and to poach
alligators' eggs in the south, will be made as criminal as to poach the
eggs of pheasants in the west. Foreign states besought BENTHAM
for constitutions—why do not the folks of Montreal apply to Mr.
GRANTLEr BERKELEY for a short, concise, stringent law, or a set of
laws, like a set of razors—one for every week-day, and a particularly
sharp one for Sundays, for the protection of alligators? Surely he
might work into a code his grand panacea—his never-failing “punch
on the head”—with the most beneficent effect,
“The alligator is a formidable-looking creature, it is true, but he is generally harmless.
His office is to prowl in the sluggish waters of this southern region, pick up what he can,
and digest it into excellent oil for the illumination of our houses.”

PUNCH AND LOUIS NAPOLEON.
The Foreign Ambassadorsin London
have, it appears, had a meeting to con-
sider what course they will take with
reference to Louis NAPoleon. They
have come to the magnanimous con-
clusion of cutting him dead, till they
receive instructions from their respec-
tive sovereigns. We, who are wholly
independent of the influence of courts,
shall have much pleasure in receiving
the Prince to a quiet chop on any day
that may be convenient. We are quite
sure that Punch may extend his hospi-
ºtality to the stranger, without any fear
of compromising the British Lion.

Statues, in former times, were erected to make illustrious men the
subjects of admiration, but statues in the present day seem to be set
up, in London, for the purpose of making great—and occasionally little
people ridiculous. His late lamented Majesty GeoRGE THE Fourth,
who certainly did a good deal in his lifetime to ornament the me-
tropolis—for he may be said to have found it of brick and left it of
stucco–has been doomed after his death to look on at the spoiling of
one of the first sites in Europe. There he sits, on his mammoth
charger, contemplating the constant squirting of two melancholy
syringes. We should not be surprised to see the spirit of the fastidious
Guelph descend from his horse, and, walking quietly towards the
basins, wash his hands altogether of such a paltry exhibition.
Nelson is better provided for, inasmuch as he at least has his back
turned to the dismal duettino of “Water parted from the Pump;” but
he is tied by the leg, with an immense coil of rope twisted round his
calf, to prevent his cutting away from a position in which he is only
a laughing-stºck. -
Georgetire Trinad is another illustration of the ill-treatment of our
sovereigns and heroes, when they have passed into a state of statue-
The good ſold King sits opposite to the Bank of RANsonſ,
ng the people who go in and out, and really looking as if he
would not object to pay RANsom a good roundsum to come out and
ransom him from his absurd position.
The Duke of York is perhaps placed where he would like to have
been in his own lifetime, quite above the reach of all annoyances.
We cannot, however, tamely submit to the proposed erection of the
Duke of WELLINGrox's Statue on the top of the arch opposite his
Grace's residence. We cannot bear to see the Dukeriding to posterity
along the spikes of the park railings. We may be told that his being
placed on the top of an “imperial” will be illustrative of his having
crushed the imperial power in France; and ºthere is certainly some-
thing in the fact of the imperial looking as if it must inevitably give
way under him. - º
SIR F. W. TRENch, in a letter to the Times, justifies there being no
precedent by asking, where was the precedent for the valour which the
statue is intended to celebrate? This would be just as good an excuse
for anything so unprecedented as fixing the statue with the horse's legs
in the air, with the Duke standing on his head ; and indeed it might
be urged, that as the Duke always relied upon his own judgment, and
was very headstrong, he may be said to have really stood upon his
head; and this mode of placing the statue would therefore be really
appropriate. We can only protest, in the name of common sense and
§. º against the contemplated mode of disposing of the Hero of
aterloo.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. JEAMES AGAIN.
“DEAR MR. PUNCH,
“As newmarus inquiries have been maid both at my privit
ressddence, The Wheel of Fortune Otel, and at your Hoffis, regarding
the fate of that dear babby, JAMEs HANGELo, whose primmiture
dissappearnts caused such hagnies to his distracted parents, I must
begg, dear Sir, the permission to ockupy a part of your valuble
collams once more, and hease the public mind about my blessid boy.
“Wictims of that nashnal cuss, the Broken Gage, me and MRs.
PLUsh was left in the train to Cheltenham, soughring from that most
disagreeble of complaints, a halmost broken Art. The skreems of MRs.
JEAMEs might be said almost to out-Y the squeel of the dying, as we
rusht into that fashnable Spaw, and my pore MARY HANN found it was
not Baby, but Bundles I had in my lapp.
“When the old Dowidger, LADY BAREACREs, who was waiting
heagerly at the train, that owing to that abawminable brake of Gage,
the luggitch, her Ladyship's Cherrybrandy box, the cradle for LADY
HANGELINA's baby, the lace, crockary and chany, was rejuiced to one
immortial smash; the old cat howld at me and pore dear MARY HANN,
as if it was huss, and not the infunnle Brake of Gage, was to blame ;
and as if we ad no misfortns of our hown to deplaw. She bust out
about my stupid imparence; called MARY HANN a good for nothink
creecher, and wep and abewsd and took on about her broken Chayny
Bowl, a great deal mor than she did about a dear little Christian child.
“Don’t talk to me abowt your bratt of a babby,” (seshe); ‘where's
my bowl —where's my medsan 2–where's my bewtiffle Pint lace —
All in rewins through your stupiddaty, you brute, you!”
“‘Bring your haction aginst the Great Western, Maam, says I,’ quite
riled by this crewel and unfealing hold wixen. “Ask the pawters at
Gloster, why yourgoods is spiled—it's not thefust time they’ve been asked
the question. Git the gage haltered aginst the nex time you send for
medsan—and meanwild buy some at the Plow—they keep it very good
and strong there, I’ll be bound. Has for us, we’re a going back to the
cussid station at Gloster, in such of our blessid child.”
“‘You don't mean to say, young woman,’ seshee, “that you're not
going to LADY HANGELINA: what's her dear boy to do 7 who's to
nuss it 2 °
“‘You muss it, Maam,' says I. “Me and MARY HANN return this
momint by the Fly.” And so (whishing her a suckastic ajew) Mrs.
JEAMEs and I lep into a one oss weakle, and told the driver to go like
mad back to Gloster.
“I can't describe my pore gals hagny juring our ride. She sat in
the carridge as silent as a milestone, and as madd as a march Air.
When we got to Gloster she sprang hout of it as wild as a Tigris, and
rusht to the station, up to the fatle Bench.
“‘My child, my child,’ shreex she, in a hoss, hot voice. “Where's my
infant a little bewtifle child, with blue eyes, dear MR. PolicEMAN,
give it me—a thousand guineas for it.”
“‘Faix, Mam, says the man, a Hirishman, “and the divvle a babby
have I seen this day except thirteen of my own—and you’re welcome
to any one of them, and kindly.”
“As if his babby was equal to ours, as my darling MARY HANN said,
afterwards. All the station was scrouging round us by this time—
pawters & clarx and refreshmint people and all. “What's this year
row about that there babby ?’ at last says the Inspector, stepping
hup. I thought my wife was going to jump into his harms. ‘Have
you got him 7” says she.
“Was it a child in a blue cloak 2' says he.
“‘And blue eyes l’ says my wife.
“I put a label on him and sent him on to Bristol; he's there by
this time. The Guard of the Mail took him and put him in a letter-
box,’ says he “he went 20 minutes ago. We found him on the broad
gauge line, and sent him on by it, in course, says he. “And it'll be a
caution to you, young woman, for the future, to label your children
along with the rest of your luggage.”
“If my piguniary means had been such as once they was, you may
emadgine I'd have ad a speshle train and been hoff like smoak. As it
was, we was obliged to wait 4 mortial hours for the next train (4 ears
they seemed to us), and then away we went.
“‘My boy! my little boy ' ' says poor, choking MARY HANN,
when we got there. “A parcel in a blue cloak,’ says the man 2 “No
body claimed him here, and so we sent him back by the mail. An
Irish nurse here gave him some supper, and he’s at Paddington by this
time. Yes,’ says he, looking at the clock, “he’s been there these ten
minutes.”
“Bºt seeing my poor wife's distracted histarricle state, this good-
naturl man says, “I think, my dear, there's a way to ease your mind.
We'll know in five minutes how he is.”
“‘Sir,’ says she, “don’t make sport of me.”
“’No, my dear, we'll telegraph him.”
. “And he began hopparating on that singlar and ingenus elecktricle
inwention, which aniliates time, and carries intellagence in the twink-
ling of a peg-post.
“‘I'll ask,’ says he, “for child marked G. W. 273.”
“Back comes the telegraph with the sign “All right.”
“‘Ask what he's doing, sir,’ says my wife, quite amazed. Back
comes the answer in a Jiffy—
“‘C. R. Y. I. N. G.”
“This caused all the bystanders to laugh excep my pore MARY
HANN, who pull'd a very sad face.
“The good-naterd feller presently said, “he’d have another trile;’
and what d'ye think was the answer ? I'm blest if it wasn't—
“‘P. A. P.”
“He was eating pap ! There's for you—there’s a rogue for you—
there's a March of Intaleck 1 MARY HANN smiled now for the fust
time. ‘He'll sleep now,” says she. And she sat down with a full
hart. * * * :* * * *
“If hever that good-natered Shooperintendent comes to London, he
need never ask for his skore at the Wheel of Fortune Hotel, I promise
you—where me and my wife and JAMEs HANGELo now is ; and where

JENKINS AND CARLOTTA GRISI.
THAT horrible fellow, JENRINs, has flown back—like a bird to its
nest—to the Morning Post, where he threatens to be the death of us.
In his remarks on the first appearance of CARLott AGRIsI, he compared
one of the steps of a fair danseuse to the graceful efforts of a bird to
avoid the gun of the fowler. JENRINs's sporting experience has led
him, we presume, principally into farm-yards, where he has had the
mortification of being dodged by the ducks, geese, and other game that
he has been in the habit of cruelly popping at. The beautiful balance:
of CARLotta GRIsI, and her fascinating oscillation from side to sile,
may have reminded JENRINs of a very large bird trying to avoid a
very awkward fowler ; but the simile, however appropriate, is not
particularly elegant in itself, or flattering to its fair subject.

PUNCH, O,
THE LONDON
BOM BASTES FURICSO’S GAZETTE.
THERE is a journal published in New York, called the
Military and Naral Chronicle—a rag solely devoted
to the triumphant musterings and doings of the
Yankee MARs. It gives “correct likenesses” of
MAJor-GENERAL STRIKER and other heroes, in con-
genial wood. Its intelligence reeks with gunpowder.
Here is a sample :-
“The over-coats of the City Guard not having all been finished,
the parade has been postponed until the 20th of April.”
That the tailor was not brought to a Court-martial,
speaks, with a tongue of thunder, in accusation of
great laxity of discipline. However, when they are
done, they will be tarnation smart, for—
“The over-coats of the Guard are very neat, and when in use
the corps will present a very soldier-like display.”
In the following, VENUs takes a graceful turn with
MARS :—
“Glorious Times among the Continentals.-The gallant Capt.
Cox, our much respected friend, lately of the 4th Co. 3rd Regi-
ment, has taken to himself a wife—his choice was excellent- the
Captain knew where to find beauty, accomplishment, and
intellect combined.”
Come we, ‘however, to the ceremony chronicled in
No. 34, vol. viii., dated April 4, 1846—the presenta-
tion of “a most elegant service of plate, and "-and,
reader 1–" and a pair of military boots and gold
spurs to GENERAL STRIKER . " The boots were presented by EN-
sign Nickinson. A few extracts from his speech will strike upon the
heart like a drum :—
“GENERAL-These boots are not ordinary calf-skin, they are all inspiring reminis-
cences of times of an eartraordinary period.
“Times that tried men's souls, dressed Bull's hide, and pricked him on to toe the mark.
“They are polished remembrances of men who sonced seeds of liberty, which have
wared strong and healthy in the corn patches of American freedom.
“I am aware that a much more finished allusion to the imperishable days of our
infancy ns a nation is expected from me on this occasion, but I am altogether too poor n
cobbler to vamp upon a subject that inspires more eloquence yearly than the souls of
100,000 pair of Demosthenian orators, with well tanned lungs of orhide, could give
utterance to from the days of King Crispin till the hour in which the last man shall
tipple his finishing heel tap.”
And so on. But we cannot give a line more, even to so great a wit
as ENSIGN NICRINson. We must proceed to GENERAL STRIKER —
“The General felt highly gratified with the Ensign's remarks, and replying thereto
with his usual wit and humour, accepted them, and tried them on—they fitted beau-
tifully.”
That is, the boots, not the remarks. We are glad that the boots
were a capital fit. Had they been a little tight, they would have been
found extremely inconvenient on a march, and much more so on a
retreat.
However, the boots of STRIKER are now a matter of the world's
history ; equally so, with the leather of that equal hero, who, defying
the universe, wrote under his calf-skin :—
“Whoever dares these boots displace,
Must meet Bombast's face to face ''
Punch has now done his best to give immortality to GENERAL
STRIKER. Whoever seeks to know more of the General must consult
the Military and Naral Chronicle, April 4, of New York.

Sigh do I say ? perhaps it should be sneeze;

Blunts too our nasal sensibilities :
Ah! I have not sneez'd now these many years.
'Tis hard from old companions but to part,
What must it be to cut them, then, for aye 2
As I must thee, thou Snuff-Box of my heart,
Because to-morrow is my wedding-day.
I’ve vow'd no more to use thee. Ask not why:
I'm told I must not do so; that's enough ;
For MARY ANNE declares that she shall die,
If eer she sees me take a pinch of snuff.
Then go, my box; but, first, my thanks accept
For many a notion—now and then, a hit—
Which in this noddle would perchance have slept,
Hadst thou not put me up to snuff a bit.
And oh yet more for many a service when
Vex'd. disappointed, savage, thou for me
Philosophy hast strengthen'd with Etrenne,
And furnish'd consolation in Rappee.
Friend at a pinch—excuse the ancient pun—
Farewell ! my single life will soon be o'er :
With thee, for ever, must I now have done;

indeed at various places, too numerous

honest bread is, I'm sure of it, dry as a chip: nevertheless, I had
virtuously resolved to swallow it, when a newspaper—the best public
instructor I think I have heard my grandmother call it—fell into my
hands. From that moment, virtue appeared to me not to be thought
of by a stirring man. In that newspaper Iread ‘A Flagrant Case of
Swindling; a very pleasant and animated story, showing how twenty
tradesmen had been induced to send home their goods to a patron in a
military cloak, with military moustachios. They had no other
vouchers for their customer's forthcoming money than “his gentle-
manly exterior' and—pardon the vulgarism—they were done.’
“‘Gentlemanly exterior tº Itºimmediately appeared to me that
when Fortune endowed a man with this, and with nothing more, she
intended that he should make the most of it. Sir, I have attended
various lectures at the Polytechnic and other Institutions, and have
learned that NATURE-in her inscrutable doings—has formed one class
of animals to fatten upon another. Your beggar with ‘a gentlemanly
exterior' is expressly produced to live upon tradesmen. This was my
theory; and a successful practice of no, I will not tell even you, how
many years—has confirmed me in the truth, that to have “a gentle-
manly exterior' is to have everything of shopkeepers. Very often,
with a feeling of human weakness that—I own it—I ought to have
subdued, I have had to repress the zeal of tradesmen in their anxiety
to be plucked. Not that they are men deficient of a certain sort of
intelligence: assuredly not. Most of them have a wonderfully quickeye
for a bad half-crown, whº, nevertheless, cannot see the brassy pocket-
piece under the thin wash ºf a gentlemanly exterior:
“Tradesmen may say what they like; they may, just for the sake
of appearances, make a great outcry when they are robbed ; but, in
their hearts, I'm certain of it, they like it. Like maids under Christ-
mas mistletoe, they squeal and makeanoise, but they love to be rifled;
otherwise they would not submit to it so easily—they would take more
precaution—make some inquiries. But no, sir-mo. In nine cases out
often, they cannot—they will not—resist “the gentlemanly exterior.”

considered too much fºr the show in its present state,) is willing to treat with any
Fire-eater, Slack-rope Dancer, or Spotted Boy—that he may be shown with the
establishment, no additional charge being made to a patronising and discerning public.

DISTINGUISHED PUFFERS.
People are very naturally surprised at the zeal and amiability
manifested by several nobles of the land in coming forward to testify
to the merits of quacks, chemists, and corn-cutters. Old WARREN, of
blacking celebrity, used to avow that he kept a poet. George Robins
is believed to have for some time retained the services of a novelist
who, by his magic descriptions, turned patches of grass into paddocks.
But in the present day it would seem that puffing has become more
ambitious; and no advertising establishment can be ... conn-
plete without a nobleman. As to the corn-cutters, they have on their
side so many members of the peerage, that they could carry the corn
question of themselves, while the proprietor of some pill or ointment
has got so completely into the good graces of the EARL or Alphonough,
that his lordship seems to pass his time in taking pills, ting
puffs about them for the newspapers.
As the aristocracy have latterly devoted themselves to
this branch of utility, we think an advertisement son like the
following would be productive of much good to the proprietors of
quack medicines:–
WANºp. by the Proprietor of anew Pill, an Earl who is willing to be cured
of every disease, and to notify the fact of his restoration to health in the public
newspapers. A Gouty Marquis will be liberally treated with: and Dukes with corns
or bunions may enter into an arrangement, either by the week, month, or season.
There is a vacancy for a consumptive Countess; or any lady of title having three or
four daughters who are willing to take pulmonic wafers, and sign testimonials, may
hear of a desirable offer. Persons signing the testimonials without taking the wafers,
will be allowed the price of the latter in soap, or any other fancy article of perfumery.
N.B. No Irish Earl need apply, as no person of this description will on any
account be treated with. A few Barristers wanted for the new voice Lozenges, and
an engagement is open to any magistrate who is willing to recommend the portable
luncheon in his official capacity.
PUNCH*S*REVIEW.
Mrs. Gaudies duriain factures. (New Edition.)
WE have long wished to speak of this extraordinary book. Again
and again have we taken the penin our hand, but nothing worthy of
the theme would come. Well, we were about to consent to an igno-
minious silence, when a correspondent—and, of course, a friend—
directed our attention to a charming work called Emilia Wyndham, in
which, to our delight, we found the review done—inimitably done—for
us. (See p. 76, vol. i.). Here it is:-
“What?” said extrºta, her peach-down cheek glowing with emotion; ‘You do not
like Mrs. Caudle? well, I never woman as I am, I adore it. All the springs—the
springes I should rather say-of woman's nature are so deliciously, so delicately
developed in that love of a book. "Twould have beguiled. Evelierselfin herbanishment.
She would have looked into its limpid page, and, as erstat the fountain, when but a day
old-alas-how soon we women take to mirrors -she would have seen the reflection of
her very soul well, if ever 1 marry’—and here EMitta looked with ecstatic wickedness
in the eyes of her lover-" if ever I marry, I should wish no better bridal present than
satin-1” --
*H*NRy-what could he do?—instantaneously whipped his arm round EMILIA's
waist, and looking in her blue orbs, exclaimed, in avoice tremulous with passion,
* EMILIA, thoushalt have it.”
There is much more after this fashion in the book, to which we refer
the curious reader. We can only add, that the publishers are desirous
of informing “those about to marry "that EMILLA's suggestion has been
acted upon, and that Caudles, bound for bridal presents, may be had at
the shortest notice.

THE accusations of fraud and peculation brought against the great
American statesman, MR. WEBstER, have turned out to be utterly
groundless. We fear MR, WEBstER will lose his popularity amongst
his countrymen in Pennsylvania.

London, in the event of an invasion, is at all events protected from a
similar spoliation, for all its statues are so bad that not the greatest
barbarian would do us the friendly turn to carry away one of them.

THE Public will no doubt have been very greatly edified at beholding the cellars now
in the course of exposure beneath the NElson Column, at Trafalgar Square. We un-
derstand these cellars will be opened as an ale and sandwich establishment, in the
| course of a few weeks; and the proceeds will be devoted to the completion of the monu-
ment. The best view of these interesting cellars may be obtained by º to the
top of an omnibus. A celebrated archaeologist has already visited them, on hearing
that there was a barrow to be met with inside; but on close examination, it was found
to be a barrow wheeled in by the boy, at the commencement of the works, and never
wheeled out again. The barrow, of course, having remained within the cellar for so
| long a period, is looked upon as a wondrous piece of antiquity. The cellar is to be fur-
nished with a public-house license, and the figure of NElson at the top will make an
excellent sign for the premises. By the bye, we are happy to have it in our power to
give a design, by MR. Pugin, for the completion of the base of the column, in accordance

with the prevailing taste for mediaeval ornament. We do not pretend to understand
the meaning of the figures shown in this sketch ; but this only proves the fidelity with
which the beautiful barbarism of the middle ages has been adopted. Some over-fasti-
dious critics may object to the introduction of monstra horrenda into a modern design,
but that which is familiar can never befrightful, and to familiarise us with the sight
of these objects is the surest way to divest them of their repulsive character.
Great Triumph of Literature.
A DISTINGUIslied Member of Parliament—but whose name we are not permitted to
give—has been so convinced by Mr. Jesse that the Dog is superior to Man, that he
has resolutely taken to all-fours, and says nothing but—“bow-wow !” He is daily taken
an airing in the garden by the footman, tethered to a sky-blue ribbon. So strong is the
infatuation upon him, that he has twice bitten the butcher'
PUNCH'S POLITICAL DICTIONARY.
LEAGUE-ANTI-Corn-Law. An Association formed
to do a certain thing, and wonderful to relate, actually
doing it. The Anti-Corn-Law League originated at a
public dinner given to DR. Bowning, in 1838, at
Manchester, and is a remarkable instance of after-din-
ner enthusiasm having led to anything like sincerity
and earnestness. As the League progressed it took
to publishing tracts against the Corn-Laws, and issued
about one hundred tons; but it is a well-known truth
that tracts never make a subject attractive. The argu-
ments are believed to have been weighty, and put the
question on a broad scale, for they succeeded input-
ting it on those very broad scales that are generally
used by the cheesemongers. The other measures of
the Anti-Corn-Law League were, however, taken
with so much judgment, and pursued with so much
energy, that the Government, placed in power for
the purpose of protecting the Corn Laws, became so
completely converted as to propose and carry their
abolition.
LEASE. From the French word laisser, to let; or,
others think, from the English word least, because of
the three estates, freehold, copyhold, and leasehold,
the leased is the least to all intents and purposes.
The poet who tells us that— -
“It may be for years, and it may beforever,”
must have had in his eye a lease, which certainly
“may be for years,” and a fee-simple, which not only
“may be,” but must be, “for ever.” Bishops are
restrained from leasing the land of the bishopric, but
may sell the produce; and thus a Bishop may dispose
of his entire rick, but cannot let the ground the hay
was grown upon.
Legacy. A bequest of goods and chattels by will
Some parents leave a good name as a legacy to their
children; and some children, directly they get the
good name, put it on the back of a bill as the best
means of turning it into a profit. Many a good name-
has been eventually dishonoured by this process. A
legacy is either general or specific. The man who left
behind him a receipt for a pill that was a specific for
every disease, left undoubtedly a specific legacy. As
it is just possible that a man may not have been taxed-
heavily enough in his lifetime, a tax is laid on his pro-
perty at his death, called a legacy duty; so that the
tax-gatherer may be said to pursue his victim even
beyond the grave.
LEGATE. According to some, from the Latin word-
legatus, one sent on a commission; but according to
others, a person who comes by the aid of his legs from
a distant place in the character of an ambassador.
Solar Intelligence.
OUR old friend, the Sun, had, last week, a glorious
time of it. He amused himself by melting a large
quantity of butter, making a lot of hay, and performing
other feats, some of them exceedingly useful, but
others merely fantastical. Towards the middle of the
day he seemed dreadfully disposed for a broil, but he
generally got quietly off to bed at his usual hour with-
out doing any serious mischief. -

T H E SNOBS OF ENG LAN D.
BY ONE OF THEMSELWes.
CHAPTER xvi-ON LITERARY SNOBs.
HAT will he say about Literary
Snobs 2 has been a question, I
make no doubt, often asked by
the public. How can he let off
his own profession ? Will that
truculent and unsparing monster,
who attacks the nobility, the
clergy, the army, and the ladies
indiscriminately, hesitate when the
turn comes to égorger his own flesh
and blood 2
- My dear and excellent querist,
whom does the Schoolmaster flog
so resolutely as his own son 2
Didn't BRUTUs chop his offspring's head off? You have a very bad
opinion indeed of the present state of Literature and of literary
men, if you fancy that any one of us would hesitate to stick a knife
into his neighbour penman, if the latter's death could do the state
any service. -- -
But the fact is, that in the literary profession THERE ARE No SNoBs.
Look round at the whole body of British men of letters, and I defy you
to point out among them a single instance of vulgarity, or envy, or
assumption. ---
Men and women, as far as I have known them, they are all modest
in their demeanour, elegant in their manners, spotless in their lives,
You
but why? Not in the least out of malice; not at all from envy ;
merely from a sense of truth and public duty. Suppose, for instance,
I good-naturedly point out a blemish in my friend Mr. Punch's person,
and say Mr. P. has a hump-back, and his nose and chin are more
crooked than those features in the Apollo or ANTINous, which we
are accustomed to consider as our standards of beauty; does this
argue malice on my part towards Mr. Punch * Not in the least. It
is the critic's duty to point out defects as well as merits, and he inva-
riably does this duty with the utmost gentleness and candour.
An intelligent foreigner's testimony about our manners is always
worth having, and I think, in this ---
respect, the work of an eminent | º
American, MR. N. P. WILLIs, is | |
eminently valuable and impartial. º | º
In his “History of Ernest Clay,” a Lull º
crack Magazine writer, the reader all *
will get an exact account of the
life of a popular man of letters in
England. He is always the great
lion of society.
He takes the pas of Dukes and
Earls ; all the nobility crowd to
see him : I forget how many Ba-
ronesses and Duchesses fall in love
with him. But on this subject let
us hold our tongues. Modesty for-
bids that we should reveal the
names of the heart-broken Coun-
tesses and dear Marchionesses who
are pining for every one of the
contributors in this periodical.
If anybody wants to know how
intimately authors are connected
with the fashionable world, they
have but to read the genteel novels. ; º
What refinement and delicacy per- ### -- -º
vades the works of MRs. BARNABY
What delightful good company do you meet with in MRs. ARMYTAGE .
She seldom introduces you to anybody under a Marquis I don't
know anything more delicious than the pictures of genteel life in Ten
Thousand a Year, except perhaps the Young Duke, and Coningsby.
There's a modest grace about them, and an air of easy high fashion,
which only belongs to blood, my dear Sir—to true blood.
And what linguists many of our writers are I LADY Bulwen,
LADY LONDONDERRY, SIR Edward himself—they write the French
language with a luxurious elegance and ease, which sets them far
above their continental rivals, of whom not one (except PAUL DE
Kock), knows a word of English.
And what Briton can read without enjoyment the works of JAMEs,
so admirable for terseness; and the playful humour and dazzling off-
hand lightness of AINsworth Among other humorists, one might
glance at a JERRold, the chivalrous advocate of Toryism and Church
and State ; an à Beckett, with a lightsome pen, but a savage earnest-
ness of purpose ; a JEAMEs, whose pure style, and wit unmingled with
buffoonery, was relished by a congenial public.
Speaking of critics, perhaps there never was a review that has
done so much for literature as the admirable Quarterly.
prejudices, to be sure, as which of us have not ? It goes out of its
way to abuse a great man, or lays mercilessly on to such pretenders
as KEATs and TENNYson ; but on the other hand, it is the friend of
all young authors, and has marked and nurtured all the rising talent
of the country. It is loved by everybody. There, again, is Blackwood's
Magazine—conspicuous for modest elegance and amiable satire ; that
Review never passes the bounds of politeness in a joke.
It has its
It is the
arbiter of manners; and, while gently exposing the foibles of Lon-
doners (for whom the beaur esprits of Edinburgh entertain a justifiable
contempt), it is never coarse in its fun. The fiery enthusiasm of the
Athenæum is well known; and the bitter wit of the too difficult Lite-
The Eraminer is perhaps too timid, and the Spectator
rary Gazette.
too boisterous in its praise—but who can carp at these minor faults 2
No, no ; the critics of England and the authors of England are unri-
valled as a body ; and hence it becomes impossible for us to find fault
with them.
Above all, I never knew a man of letters ashamed of his profession.
Those who know us, know what an affectionate and brotherly spirit
there is among us all. Sometimes one of us rises in the world : we
never attack him or sneer at him under those circumstances, but
rejoice to a man at his success. If Jones dines with a lord, SMITH
never says Jones is a courtier and cringer. Nor, on the other hand,
does Jones, who is in the habit of frequenting the society of great
people, give himself any airs on account of the company he keeps ;
but will leave a Duke's arm in Pall Mall to come over and speak to
poor BRow N, the young penny-a-liner.
That sense of equality and fraternity amongst Authors has always
struck me as one of the most amiable characteristics of the class. It
is because we know and respect each other, that the world respects us
so much ; that we hold such a good position in society, and demean
ourselves so irreproachably when there.
Literary persons are held in such esteem by the nation, that about
two of them have been absolutely invited to Court during the present
reign : and it is probable that towards the end of the season, one or
two will be asked to dinner by SIR Ronent Peel. -
They are such favourites with the public, that they are continually
obliged to have their pictures taken and published ; and one or two
could be pointed out, of whom the nation insists upon having a fresh
portrait every year. Nothing can be more gratifying than this proof
of the affectionate regard which the people has for its instructors.
Literature is held in such honour in England, that there is a sum of
near twelve hundred pounds per annum set apart to pension deserving
persons following that profession. And a great compliment this is, too,
to the professors, and a proof of their generally prosperous and flourish-
ing condition. They are generally so rich and thrifty, that scarcely
any money is wanted to help them.
If every word of this is true, how, I should like to know, am I to
write about Literary Snobs 2
A “Forlorn Hope.”
MARsmAL BUGEAUD has hit upon a new expedient for capturing
ABD-El-KADER. He has taken his dog. The cunning Marshal evi-
dently thinks that his only chance of finding out ABD-EL-RADER's
hiding-place is by following in the track of his dog. It would make
a fine picture for Versailles—“The French army marching to Victory,”
and a poodle at the head of it.

HALLO ! SIR PETER—what, LAURIE 1—Just one minute. You have
not heard the news 2 Of course not. We knew it. Otherwise your
reforming heart would be now beating through your waistcoat. You
have “put down” the roundabouts at Chalk Farm—you have dº.
stroyed the last hopes of Sabbatical gingerbread | You are a great
man, LAURIE l—a tremendous person 1 Should we ever erect a statue
to MIDAs, you must be the model for some part of him. Well,—have
you heard ” At the last Court of Aldermen—(but you were there,
and, wishing for an omelette at the Tuilleries, didn't you laud Louis-
PHILIPPE *)—ALDERMAN Wilson gave in the report of the Inspector
of the weights and measures of the City of London. Here it is :—
“The poor are defrauded frequently by those tradespeople who have their goods
weighed in packets for their customers, viz., flour, by the bakers; tea, sugar, cocoa, &c.,
by the grocers; snuff and tobacco, &c., by the tobacconists; candles, starch, blue, &c.,
by the oilmen. The practice of some coal-dealers is to use small weights in their ma-
chines in order to confuse their customers, who may require, say half a hundred weight
of coal. They will use 281b., 14lb., and 71b., and thus manage to give 71b. short weight,
as was proved before the Police Committee a few days ago.”
Now, LAURIE,-you who have put down suicide, and the swings at
Chalk Farm—you who wrinkle a penthouse brow on the judgment-
seat at a thief of fourpence,—try the bakers, try the grocers, try the
tobacco-men, try the coal-merchants ; try the thieves and swindlers
of the City, and—for a moment forgetting the draught of an Act of
Parliament for putting down advertising-vans—bend all your mighty
energies to obtain an Act for the punishment of your fellow-citizens

At the last meeting of the Ragged School Union Society, Loºp -
AsHLEY said—
“Many persons objected to these schools, on account ºf their name; and one friend
of his own had told him that if the name were changed, he would give a large sum
towards their support.”
LoRD AshLEY's friend—whoever he may be, whether of the clergy
or the laity—is a wise man; a man who knows the world, and all its
learned double-meanings. Why—can there be a doubt of it *—if we
begin to label things with their proper names, if we call “rags" rags
—dirt, dirt, hypocrisy, hypocrisy, there is an end of the great
business of society. For, we contend that it is the work of one
moiety of the world to put off certain pocket-pieces, as though they
were sterling coin; and the other half to take them with a grave,
smug face, as current gold; though occasionally each party puts his
tongue in his cheek, to show that at all events he is too clever not to see
the counterfeit that passes for sterling money. Now, many people,
like Lord Ashley's friend, do not choose to have their benevolence
associated with raggedness—it is not respectable. Rags, to be sure,
are the gowns of the pupils. They contheir books in their “looped and
windowed wretchedness;” But why say so * Why should the gentility
of very genteel benevolence be turned from its purpose by the nasty
poverty—the foul and tattered condition of the recipients? Why
should not wretchedness be at least, nominally, laid in lavender * Why
cannot we have pleasant destitution ? Now rags—real working-day
rags, fluttering about unwashed flesh—are too true. Therefore,
although we see the tatters of the students—although we nose them,
can we not, at the least, sink the foul, frowsy truth, in some sweet,
conventional lie? Yes: we will not say “Ragged Schools.”

respectable—as there are no “rags,”—canvas your friends and ac-
- |quaintance ; and although you know that you ask for the “Ragged
Schools,” sink the vulgar name, and beg subscriptions for the “Youths

ABD-EL-KADER'S DOG.
WE had no sooner learned from the Nouvelliste de Marseille the news of
the capture of ABD-El-KADER's Dog, and the transmission of the crea-
ture to France, than we despatched the famous MR. JEsse to Paris, for
the purpose of drawing up a report on the animal; and it is only due
to the author of The Anecdotes of Dogs to state that the document is
worthy of his exalted reputation, as an interpreter of canine intellect
and canine sensibilities. Attention please, for MR. JEsse.
“Your reporter has examined ABD-EL-KADER's Dog, which, after
minute inspection, he has discovered to be a greyhound. The Dog
shows the strongest predilection for the Mahometan faith. Your
reporter tried him with a copy of the Koran and a copy of Mother
Hubbard: on the Koran your reporter placed a chicken ; on Mother
Hubbard a pork sausage. The Dog, turning his head to the east, began
to eat the chicken, but, like a good Mahometan, showed an evident
repugnance to the swine's flesh.
“When the Dog's mistress is about to leave the house, the Dog
immediately brings her veil, nor can threats or entreaties induce him
to cross the threshold until the lady has covered her face—another
striking trait of his Mahometan origin.
disguise that the Dog's notions of polygamy also partake of the same
lamentable darkness.
“A Turk, who sells rhubarb, having attracted the Dog's notice, the
Dog showed his sympathy for the Mussulman by sitting upon his hind
legs, and swallowing, with unmoved countenance, three lumps, as big
as walnuts, of the drug.
“The Dog touchingly vindicates his love of country, by licking every
Frenchman he meets with his feet in morocco.

... EGYPTIAN IMPRESSIONS.
(Being a Letter from FUDDool, EFFENDI, in London, to his friend
KY-Bosh-EL-HADJ, of Musr Cairo.)
PREFACE.
E make no apology for publishing the
first part of this interesting document.
Its Orientalisms are no doubt familiar
to our readers, from the works of
MoRIER, LANE, FRAzer, &c. We have
retained many Arabic words, fearing
to mar their effect by translating. How-
ever, in accordance with the practice of
English writers of Oriental romances,
we have always printed the English by
the side of the Arabic. It may be
thought that this is superfluous, or
that the English might as well be given
at once. Such criticisms, however, are
not worth notice.
“On the 8th day of the Month Show-wal,
in the year 1244.
“To the nephew of an excellent
maternal uncle, to the learned of El-
Azhar (the University of Cairo), to
the master of El-áhh-a-dees (the tradi-
tions of the Prophet), to the doctor
of El-surf (grammar) and El-muntinck
(logic), to the expounder of Elſickh
(the religious, moral, and civil law),
Rybash-Ibn-Hum-bočg-ée El Haq, to
whom be peace, in the name of the Pro-
phet, greeting:
“By my head, O HADJ, the liver of thy friend hath crumbled, and
his gall-bladder has burst, and he is filled with flatulence, by reason of
the madness of our master, our Lord, the Basha. May his digestion be
improved, and his corpulence increased ' Thou knowest, O HADJ, that
I, FUDDool, thy friend, have often sat with thee at the table of the
moodám (wine), and drunk thereof till I have fallen from off the
deewan (cushions) of the mustabéh (dining-room), and that I have been
known among the faithful of Musr (Cairo) as Fuddool El-nebeed (FUp-
Dool, the wine-bibber); but never did I know, till I came among the
Giaours (dogs, i.e., Christians), what was the utter confusion of the
belly, and the contraction of the heart, from much eating and drinking.
Our Lord, the Basha, hath said that his mind is enlarged, and the girth
of his soul tightened by the sights he sees in this city of the Jºnnee
(Evil Spirits), but my backbone hath become as water, and I have
eaten much dirt.
“Verily, O HADJ, these eaters of the unclean beast received us at
their Bāb (port) of Portsmouth, and said unto us, ‘Salaam aleikoom /
(Peace be with you !) Eat, O strangers l’ And they took us to the Aga
of the Makemmhe of the Bāb (Port Admiral), and there came out to us a
round-bellied man, a son of yukhn&e (fat meat), and he laughed, and said to
us, ‘Bismillah (in the name of the Prophet), tafud-dal (do me the favour
to eat'). Whereupon the Basha, to whom be honour, replied, with much
blackness of face, “Henée-an' (may it benefit); for we had already
eaten much chávoorkneh (a sort of sea-pie), on board the ship, and our
appetites were already satisfied. Nevertheless the Aga said, ‘Is it not the
hour of el-ghuda (dinner), and the koërsee (table) is ready ? Eat, O my
fathers.’ And my heart, O HADJ, was broken into small pieces, and I
said in my soul, ‘Am I not khosh (full) º' And so said the Basha, for,
verily, we had already eaten, and the waters of kleeraf (indigestion) had
flowed over our bellies, and we were sad ; so we sat, and the son of fat
meats, the Aga, laughed and ate much, and called on us to drink the
moodam (wine), and āmbéree (liqueurs), and we were exceedingly mad;
and I rose, after the fashion of a durwiesh of the Owlád Noédh (Order of
young men), and danced till the clouds of darkness covered my face,
and I fell down, and the son of fat meat laughed ; and the Basha, to
whom be praise from ALLAH ! rose and called, “O slaves, bring the kurbaj
(whip); and it was brought, and thy friend was flogged until he im-
plored the hareem of the son of fat meat (the common method of appeal
from punishment in Egypt), and the wrath of the Basha was softened,
and my face was no longer black in his eyes.
“Then we went forth to see their cannon, and the great ships of the
Giaours. I swear to thee, O HADJ that everywhere we went there
were sons of fat meat who said unto us, ‘Bismillah, is it not covered ?
Will not my Lords sit and eat º' And the sons of burnt fathers
constrained us. Then great was the confusion in the vitals of thy
friend, O HADJ. We knew not the dishes of the Giaours; the mists
of ignorance covered what we were eating. And when we thought it
was kehābs (morsels of lamb), behold, it was annáb (sweetmeats); and
that which unto the eye was as koonaféh (pancakes), was in the
mouth as khigér (cucumbers), and in the belly as fire.
“Then we, the servants of the Bashā, the fountain of light—to whom
be glory ! fell down and kissed his keften (robe), and said, “O father,
O prince of the faithful, O son of ALEE, we can eat no more; the khöleh
(stopper) of satiety is put into the döruck (bottle) of appetite. Let us
go hence, or we shall die, and our places on the deewan (cushion) shall
be empty.’ And the Basha looked terribly upon us, and said, “Allah
kerim' (Allah is merciful). Surely the Giaours cannot eat for ever. Sons
of accursed mothers, let your faces be white unto the Feringhees
(English). Eat all that is set before you, or, by the soul of Hössey N,
your back shall taste of the kurbaj (whip) and the mikradh (rod)' So
we covered the blackness of our cheeks with the robe of patience, and
did eat until our interiors were as the abode of the Jinnee, accursed of
SULEYMAN.
* “What further befel thy friend, O HADJ, I will write unto thee;
but now I must seek to apply the bitter medicine of repentance unto
the flatulence of excess.-Farewell.”
THE GOODWOOD CUP.
A FEAst there was at Goodwood spread,
With Richmond in the chair ;
A Bishop graced the table's head,
A Member too was there :
And lower down the lab’rers sat,
The men who work'd so hard ;
And all these gentry met, for that,
To give them some reward.
Our gracious QUEEN, these loyal men,
And Royal Family,
Drank first of all ; the Bishop then
They gave with three times three
“My Lord, the Bishop !” was the call,
“His health, boys I Do not slink;”
Alack alack the lab’rers all
Had drunk out all their drink.
So each poor fellow waved on high
His empty pot or cup,
And made pretence unto the eye
To drink the liquor up.
The Goodwood Cup so much renown'd,
And famed both far and near, -
This celebrated Cup, is found,
THE CUP witHouT THE BEER!
MAGNANIMITY OF LOUIS-PHILIPPE.
TERRInle is the wrath of kings Louis-PHILIPPE has very properly
punished the doctor-friend who aided Louis-Napoleon, in his escape,
iy causing the said friend to be handcuffed. In this way ought
OREstes to be punished for his devotion to PYLAdes. It is quite after
the old heroic manner. Nevertheless, the KING of the FRENCH
improves upon the vengeance of antiquity; for it will be remembered
that Louis-NApoleon, in his formidable descent upon Boulogne, which
did not yield to his battery of champagne corks, had with him an eagle
that had been trained to perch upon the NApoleon beaver. Well,
NApoleon was sent to Ham, and the eagle was forwarded to a slaugh-
ter-house, where, until the escape of the royal prisoner, it was per-
mitted to take its daily fill of offal. No sooner, however, was it known
that the captive had made off, than Louis-PHILIPPE caused the Prince’s
doctor to be handcuffed, and the Prince's eagle to be put on half-allow-
ance of garbage. The vengeance shown in either case is equally
magnanimous !

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
277
IBRAHIM PACHA.
ourteous Punch has, of course,
exercised his wonted courtesy to-
wards IBRAHIM—though the Court
Circular, shabbily enough, says
nothing about it—and has shown
him certain sights, to the astonish-
ment of the lion Mussulman. In
the first place, we took him up in
our own unostentatious way,
namely, in a patent safety cab at
Mivart's, and drove to the centre
of London Bridge. “There,” said
we, pointing to the forest of masts
in the pool ; “nothing of that sort
at the golden horn, eh 7” Then
we pointed to the fleet of steamers
whizzing, roaring away, and
thronged with crowds — every
other man, woman, and child
reading Punch—bound for Green-
wich, Woolwich, Gravesend ; to
twenty places—below bridge and
above bridge—and IBRAHIM a
hundred times said, “Allah Bis-
millah!” We then took boat, and
went down to the pool, and still
the old Egyptian stroked his
beard and wondered. Having
shown him Greenwich, we crossed
to Blackwall, and took him
into the Docks. We then drove
westward, calling upon the Bank and the Exchange by the way.
When we approached St. Paul's, IBRAHIM desired to enter it, but
for the honour of our country we told a flam: “Light of the Uni-
verse,” said we, “it is not permitted to a Mussulman to enter the Ca-
thedral.” We confess it; we thought it less dishonour to tell the
falsehood than to suffer the old Egyptian to see the twopence we should
have had to pay for him to behold the show.
PUNCH*S POLITICAL DICTIONARY.
LIBERTY. We can scarcely trust ourselves to define the meaning
of this magnificent word—which is derived from Libertas, freedom.
It is the air we breathe, and the article for which melodramatic heroes
sometimes rant till their breath is exhausted. Liberty is a very good
thing when genuine, but like every other good thing, it is very bad
when abused, and it is an article of which there is an enormous
number of counterfeits. It is generally puffed up by political quacks,
as a remedy for every disease known to the Constitution. Each
quack has, however, almost always a model recipe of his own, accord-
ing to which Liberty must be concocted ; and one of the chief condi-
tions attached to it is, that no one shall take the liberty of setting
up an opposition article. When people dared not open their
mouths during the French Revolution, when the prisons were
full of victims, and the guillotine in constant use—it was all for
the advancement of Liberty. Civil and Religious Liberty, accord-
ing to the notion of many who cry out for it, is no civility at all
to anybody, and an utter abolition of all religion. Political Liberty, in
its largest sense is, that all should be engaged in the business of
government ; so that every one is commanding and no one obeying,
like the regiment in which there were no men, but all officers. The
declaration of American Independence assumes that all men are equal,
and that they are all entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happi-
ness. Among the results of this theory are Slavery, Lynch Law,
and a disagreeable habit of making one another as uncomfortable as
possible. Notwithstanding an occasional request from conventions
sitting in public-house parlours, asking the people to throw off that
invisible article, the yoke, and trample those very inaccessible folks,
our tyrants, in the dust, we think we may say, without a clap-trap,
that England is the land of Liberty, or at least of as much liberty as it
is convenient to the generality that individuals should be allowed to
exercise.
LIEN. From the French lier, to bind. It is the right of one man to
retain the property of another till the demand of the former against
the latter is satisfied. Thus, if I catch a pick-pocket taking my
handkerchief, and I lay hold of his nose, I may remain seised of his
nose, or rather he may remain seised of my finger and thumb till my
demand is satisfied. Thus I have a lien which I should act unwisely
in allowing to slip through my fingers. What is sufficient possession
to create a lien, is a nice question ; but the safest way is to keep a
tight hand on the article, and thus, in the example we have given,
we have tried to illustrate our meaning by taking hold of the most
prominent feature. A lien may sometimes arise by pledge, as if A
borrows half-a-crown and pledges his honour that he will return it, I
have a lien upon his honour; which is probably not worth half-a-
crown, when it is given in pledge for a mere trifle.
THE “DOMINO NOIR'' AT THE HAY MARKET.
IN accordance with a practice once very prevalent among critics,
and still occasionally followed, we had prepared a notice of Le Domino
Noir, at the Haymarket, before witnessing the performance. As it is
in type, we cannot afford to throw it away, and we therefore sub-
join it for the amusement of our readers. It will be seen that we were
somewhat “out,” but we had adopted the old conventional critical tone
of abusing, which is always safer than laudation.
“The Black Domino was performed on Wednesday, at the Hay-
market, the only theatre for the legitimate drama, and, as might be
supposed, quite unsuited to lyrical purposes. FARREN made the most
he could of the first tenor part ; and STUART's basso was exceedingly
good for a tragedian. MR. BRINDAL's vocal efforts were not of the
first order ; and MEssrs. Gough, CLARKE, and others, could not be
expected to furnish a very efficient chorus.”
We had dome a good deal more in this strain, for the purpose of
showing our musical knowledge and fastidiousness of taste, but unfor-
tunately the whole article was upset, by the fact of our having recog-
nised in the band and chorus a wonderful precision and correctness;
so that any compliments to MADAME THILLoN, on her charming singing
and acting need not be qualified by cold water thrown upon the rest of
the musical arrangements.
ENCOURAGEMENT TO FIGHT.
THE State of Louisiana has passed an Act for
the protection of all debtors who are willing to
take arms against Mexico: thus offering a premium
to those heroes who, at home, are not “worth
powder and shot.”
“Standing on its Rights."
AMong the wonderful cures that are being conti-
nually advertised in the papers, we are continu-
ally seeing “A Bad Leg of Thirty Years' Standing”
alluded to. After all, the leg could not be so very
bad, if it has been standing for thirty years ; and
there is something like ingratitude on the part
of the owner of the leg, who permits it to be pro-
claimed to the world as an unworthy member.
Every man ought, we think, to stand up for his
own leg ; particularly when that leg has been
standing up for him during a period of more than
a quarter of a century. We consider that this
| advertisement less creditable to the author's heart
than to his understanding.

The stable Statesman at Ascot.
By the sporting intelligence of Thursday we find that at Ascot the
few Stakes of 100 sovereigns were won by Lord G. BENTINCR's Slander.
His Lordship was, by a singular coincidence, running his slander very
hard in the House of Commons, on the previous night, against Sir R.
PEEL's two year-old filly, Reputation. Though Slander won at Ascot, it
failed at St. Stephen's, for its noble owner was not even placed—a result
that must have been rather mortifying ; for to get “placed" is believed
to have been his only object.
THE SWEETS OF OFFICE.
THE “sweets of office” are very often, like the sweets of the pillory,
sweets gathered from dunghills and gutters, and flung in the face of
the Minister. (N.B.-Thus thinks PEEL, when listening to BENTINck.)

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A NEW WAU XHALL ERA.
IN consequence of the fine weather, we have been disappointed of a
number of jokes which we had prepared upon the opening of Vauxhall.
We had expected that it would rain, as a matter of course, directly the
doors were opened; but as the moon has taken the “royal property”
this year under its protection, and is likely to prove a harvest-moon
for the proprietors, our jokes must stand over till next season, unless
any burlesque writer chooses to sue for them in formá pauperis. We
think, however, that some extraordinary triumph should commemorate
the unparalleled event of Vauxhall having been opened so many
successive nights without a single shower of rain; and we propose, in
order to do the thing handsomely, that a grand transparen y be got
up, as large as life, in honour of WIDDIcomp, who has certainly
succeeded that fine old pump, ST. SwitHIN, as the tutelary genius of
the Gardens. It will be only a graceful compliment to him for honour-
ing the Gardens two seasons with the light of his countenance.
We are sure there is not a lamp on the premises—including the
“20,000 additional,”—which would not burn with tenfold brilliancy, and
boil over with enthusiasm in such a cause. We should not be surprised
if, like the Vestal lamps, they determined never to go out, but burnt
night and day, in order to celebrate one whose whole life has been a
practical illustration of his motto, “Never say die : " When the trans-
parency is inaugurated, the band should play appropriate tunes; such
as, “Oh there's a light in his laughing eye;” whilst a poet should
recite, at intervals, a new version of the poem of the “Last Man.”
SHORT, IF NOT SWEET.
ON IBRAHIM PACHA's journey by the South-Western Railway to
town, addresses from the servants of the Company were presented to
him at the several stations. The following specimen of these courteous
orations will serve as an example of the whole —
“To His Highness IBRAhim. PAchA. M. - - -
Check-takers, Hº: and Policemen, in the ºº, Yinº,
Company, beg respectfully to offer to your High --
The speech was here invariably cut short by a whistle and the
starting of the train, which prevented the Pacha from making that
gracious reply which there is no doubt he would otherwise have
given to it.
THE DUKE OF RICHMOND'S ORATORY.
THE MARQUIs of LoNDoNDERRY has accused the DUKE of Richmond
of “making spicy speeches” in favour of Protection. The Duke indig-
nantly repels the imputation ; and for ourselves, we think justly repêis
it. His speeches bear the same relation to spice, as the Yankee pedlar's
nutmegs to the real thing; being found, upon trial, to come from nothing
but hard wood. -
(IBRAHIM PACHA’S. VISITORS’ BOOK.
IBRAHIM had no sooner squatted comfortably down at Mrvant's,
than all the world rushed to write their names in his “book.” Doubt-
less many of these affectionate Britons believed that IBRAHIM would
be in the deepest state of anxiety lest they should fail to leave their
signatures, and therefore elbowed for pen-and-ink as though the eyes
of all Egypt were upon them. IBRAHIM drew a very long face, and
gravely stroked his beard when he turned over the list. Of the five
hundred who had written themselves down as inquiring friends, he
had never heard the names of above half-a-dozen. He thereupon
questioned his Secretary and Interpreter, a man previously sworn to
know everything about the droppers-in.

came to the fiftieth “SMITH.”)
AN ODD STEP AT THE POLISH BALL.
THERE is an important circumstance in connection with the late
Polish Ball, which we feel imperatively called to make a remark upon.
According to the papers a cord was drawn across the room, separating
one part of the company from the other. Accustomed, too, to asso-
ciate the ropes with the ring, we must say that such an arrangement
savours more of the Fancy than of the Fancy Ball. The cord, of course,
was intended to divide the Snobs from the gentlefolks; but the ques-
tion is, which were the gentlefolks, and which the Snobs 2 and on this
point we fear we differ from those who drew the line.
While on the subject, we may notice the costume of Count KASR-A-
wiski, which, JENKINs tells us, was “the object of special admiration.”
It is difficult to conceive the KAsk-A-wiski without the hoop, which is
less appropriate to a Count than to a Countess. As KASK-A-wiski was
present at the Polish Ball, probably FLAsk-ov-ollANDs and KAGG-o-
BRAND1 were there too ; and, no doubt, between them, they made the
affair go off with spirit.
A Warning to Parents.
THE Midsummer Holidays having commenced, Punch —with an
almost paternal love for the rising generation—advises parents and
guardians who do not wish their children to listen to bad language, to
avoid a certain House, the House of Commons ;-MASTER BENTINCK not

A N ON SEQUITU R.
We are not in the habit of requiring very strict logic from the
manager of a theatre ; but the Drury-Lane Play-bill of the other day
presented such a very odd specimen of reasoning that we cannot allow
it to pass without notice. ...That there may be no mistake as to the
terms of the notice, we will give the paragraph, and then add a word
or two by way of comment:- -
* “Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.--In consequence of MADEMoissLLE CARLoTTA GRisi
having expressed a desire to give the assistance of her brilliant talents to the entertain-
ments of Friday next, she will not perform to-morrow, but will repeat her celebrated
character of Paquita the day after. There will, consequently, be no performance this
evening, or to-morrow."
We can understand CARLotta GR1s expressing a desire to dance on
any particular evening, but we cannot comprehend why that should
prevent her from making her appearance on the two preceding nights;
and we are still further at
a loss to make out why there
should “consequently be no
performance this evening
or to-morrow.” Did CAR-
Lotta GRIsI's expressing a
desire to dance on Friday
preclude every one else from
dancing or singing, or doing
anything, in short, to keep
the theatre open on Wed-
nesday and .." 2
Perhaps the enormous hit
made by Stradella had too
much exhausted the energies
of the performers to allow
of their appearing again
until after an interval of at
least two evenings.
It is to be hoped CAR-
Lott A GRISI will not too
frequently express a desire
to dance on a given night
that has not yet arrived,
for it seems that when she
has said she will dance
nothing can be done in the
theatre till the event has come off in due course, and the performers
consequently lose half their salaries.
Considering the uses to which Drury Lane has now for some long
time been devoted, we recommend an alteration in the style and cos-
tume of the statue of SHAREspeARE. The position suggested in the
present sketch would be more in accordance with the present attitude
of the drama.
A BIT OF MUZZLING.
THE annual proclamation about mad dogs has just made its appear-
ance, in which muzzling is, as usual, strongly recommended. As
honourable Members, however, have lately displayed, in the heat of
debate, undoubted signs of party madness, we think some similar pre-
caution would not be amiss in the House of Commons. The way in
which some of the most rabid Protectionists have been showing their
teeth to SIR Robert makes this precaution doubly necessary. Who
knows the Premier might be bit some day by a “stable mind *" At
all events, the muzzling would have the great advantage of keeping
Members' mouths shut, and ought to be adopted, if it is only to prevent
them saying the same thing six times over.
Corwirrºrg Eventºrs.
WE were looking over a file of this year's newspapers at the Ameri-
can Coffee House, and were painfully struck with the following announce-
ment :- º:
“In a few days will be out,
THE PRIME MINISTER.”
As no date, however, was specified, let us hope the publication has
been deferred.
...tº k + 1 .
A. PETITION FROM HAM.
It is said that the citizens of Ham have “demanded steps to be taken
with the English Government to reinstate PRINCE Louis-NApoleoN in
his prison,” he was such a profitable commodity to the place. Thus,
the Prince, bringing bread well buttered to the city, made of Ham a
sandwich
IBRAHIM IN TOWN.
EARLY every one acknowledges that there
is something almost terrific in the idea of
IBRAHIM PACHA being actually in London.
We have been so in the habit of reading
about his impetuosity and all that kind of
thing, that we cannot conceive his putting
up quietly at MIvart's Hotel, and going
down to Ascot on the day of the races. We
used to hear that IBRAHIM, at the head of
his mountain horde, was doing this, that,
and the other; routing somebody on one
side, ravaging coasts, and carrying his
furious arms in all directions; and we are
therefore unprepared for finding his name
every morning in our newspapers among the fashionable movements
of the season. Considering the military impetuosity of his cha-
racter, we should suggest that a Court Circular should be specially
written to record his acts during his visit to London, in language simi-
lar to that in which we have been in the habit of hearing him spoken
of. We submit a few specimens:–
“The impetuous IBRAHIM left his lair at MIVART's, at an early hour,
and made a descent upon the breakfast-room. He ravaged a plate of
ham, and spread desolation among the French—rolls that were placed
before him. The energetic heir of MEHEMET ALI then planted his
yatagan in the bosom of a fowl, and made a desperate attack upon it,
exclaiming, in his strong Egyptian accent, “Thus will I cut off both
wings of the army of my enemy '" Having finished a hearty meal, he
rushed into the fastness of a carriage, and scoured the country until he
arrived at the Paddington terminus of the Great Western Railway.
The haughty IBRAHIM was met by MR. Russell, M.P., and the impe:
tuous Pacha, having exchanged a few signs of courtesy, precipitated
himself upon the ottoman in the saloon carriage.
“With his usual rapidity of movement he reached the race-course, and
came to a stand in a position commanding a view of all that was
passing round him. Wine was offered to the wily Egyptian, who did
honour to his old friend, the Porte, by finishing an entire bottle.”
The above are only a few of the incidents occurring on one of the
days of IBRAHIM's sojourn in this country. The narration of events
should be continued in the same spirit, when a very interesting record
of his visit would be furnished to the public, written in a style appro-
priate to the habits and character of the illustrious person, whose
proceedings cannot be faithfully chronicled in the mere every-day
language of a Court Circular. -

OUR old friend JENRINs has given us a very elaborate description of
the dresses of some of the ladies at the recent Polish Ball. Some of
them represented the Months, and others the Seasons, though the
representation could scarcely be considered very accurate; for, as one
swallow does not make a summer, so one polyanthus does not make an
April, nor one rose a June. The young ladies alluded to were, how-
ever, satisfied with this species of arrangement, and were not more
elaborate in their costume, according to JENKINs, than to stick in their
respective dresses a flower appropriate to the particular period of
which they were supposed to be the emblems. If this sort of thing can
be so easily accomplished, we should recommend a novelty in the shape
of a Public Building Quadrille, in which the fair dancers might repre-
sent such places as the Horse Guards, St. Paul's, or Westminster
Abbey. The Horse Guards could be typified by a little jack-boot in
gold, suspended to the girdle; St. Paul's could be shown by a little
cross round the neck, and Westminster Abbey by the number 3 worked
on the corsage, as indicative of the threepence paid for admission to
that magnificent exhibition.
We really think more might have been done with the costume of
the young ladies representing the Months, on the occasion of the Polish
Ball. We would have made up June with a robe of white lace, trimmed
en biais with a bundle of asparagus, with little pompons of new potatoes
round the edge, finishing in the centre with a broad bean. A corsage
of green lettuce-leaves, laid on in plaits, and terminating at the point
with a small spring onion, would have had a very graceful effect ; and
the earrings, bracelets, &c. might have consisted of small rows of peas
en marrowfat, with a hautboy accompaniment of strawberries as a fichu
for the neck.
We hope that on any similar occasion of appearing in costume to
represent Months and Seasons, we shall be apprised in time, so that we
may have the pleasure of suggesting a few dresses, of a bolder and
richer design than those which appear to have figured at the
Polish Ball.

THE SNOBS OF ENGLAND,
BY ONE OF THEMSELVES.
CHAP. XVII.-ON LITERARY SNOBS.
In a Letter from “One of Themselves” to MR, SMITH, the celebrated.
Penny-a-Liner.
- 1.-1. º
“MY DHAR SMITH,-
*- F the many indig-
nant remonstrants
who have written
regarding the opinion
expressed in the last
lecture, that there
were no Snobs in the
Literary Profession,
I have thought it best
ºzº to address you per-
*sonally, and through
\Lyou, the many gentle:
w Sºmen who are good
| enough to point out
- - instances of literary
characters whom they
are pleased to think
have the best claim
to the rank of Snob.
“Have you read poor
Theodore Crook's
Life, as given in the
Quarterly,' asks one ;
‘and does any one
merit the title of
Snob more than that
poor fellow ** “What
do you say to MRs. CRUoR's novels, and Mns. WALLop's works
of fashionable fiction?’ writes some misogynist. “Was not ToM MACAU
a Snob, when he dated from Windsor Castle P’ asks a third. A fourth—
who is evidently angry on a personal matter, and has met with a slight
from ToM FUSTIAN since he has come into his fortune—begs us to show
“What do you say to CRAwLEY Spo-
KER, the man who doesn't know where Bloomsbury Square is—the
MARQUIs of Borg1A's friend ?" writes an angry patriot, with the
Great Russell Street post-mark. “What do you say to BENDIGo DE
MINories 2" demands another curious inquirer.
“I think poor CRook's Life a wholesome one. It teaches you not to
put your trust in great people—in great, splendid, and titled Snobs. It
shows what the relations between the poor Snob and the rich Snob are.
Go to a great man's table, dear Smith, and know your place there.
Cut jokes, make songs, grin and chatter for him as his monkey does,
and amuse him, and eat your victuals, and elbow a Duchess, and be
thankful, you rogue ! Isn't it pleasant to read your name among the
fashionables in the papers ?—LoRD HookHAM, Lord CHARLEs SNIVEY,
MR. SMITH.
“MRs. CRUOR's works and Mrs. Wollop's novels are also whole-
some, if not pleasant reading. For these ladies, moving at the tip-top
of fashion, as they undoubtedly do, and giving accurate pictures of the
genteel, serve to warn many honest people who might otherwise be
taken in, and show fashionable life to be so utterly stupid, mean, tedious,
drivelling, and vulgar, as to reconcile spirits otherwise discontented to
mutton and Bloomsbury Square.
“As for the RIGHT HoNour ABLE MR. MACAU-I perfectly well recol-
lect the noise which was made about that Right Honourable gentleman's
audacity in writing a letter from Windsor Castle, and think—that he
was a Snob for putting such an address to his letter ?—no ; only that
the Public was a Snob for making such a pother about it, the Public
—that looks at Windsor Castle with terror, and thinks it blasphemy to
speak familiarly about it.
“In the first place, MR. MACAU was there, and therefore could not be
anywhere else. Why should he, then, being at one place, date his letter
from any other ? Then, I conceive, he has as good a right to be in
Windsor Castle as the Royal ALBERT himself. HER MAJESTY (be it
spoken with the respect that so awful a theme merits 1) is the august
housekeeper of that public residence. Part of her royal duty is a gra-
cious hospitality and reception of the chief officers of the nation;
therefore I opine that MR. MACAU had as good a right to his apartment
at Windsor Castle as to his red box in Downing Street; and had no
call to go to Windsor in secret, or to be ashamed of going thither, or to
conceal his residence there.
“As for honest Tom FUSTIAN, who has cut “LIBERTAs”—“LIBERTAs.”
must suffer under the calamity—until ToM publishes another novel ;
about A month before which time, LIBERTAs, as critic of the Weekly
Tomahawk, will probably receive a most affectionate invitation to
Fustianville Lodge. About this time MRs. FUsTIAN will call upon
MRs. LIBERTAs (in her yellow chariot lined with pink, and a green
hammercloth) and make the tenderest inquiries about the dear little
children. All this is very well, but LIBERTAs should understand his
place in the world; an author is made use of when wanted, and then
dropped; he must consent to mix with the genteel world upon these
conditions, and FustLAN belongs to the world now that he has a yellow
chariot and pink lining.
“All the world cannot be expected to be so generous as the MARQUIs
of Borgia, SpokER's friend. That was a generous and high-minded
nobleman—a real patron if not of letters, at least of literary men. My
Lord left SpokER almost as much money as he left to CENTsUIsse, his
valet—forty or fifty thousand pounds apiece to both of the honest
fellows. And they deserved it. There are some things, dear SMITH,
that SpokER knows ; though he doesn't know where Bloomsbury
Square is—and some very queer places too.
“And, finally, concerning young BEN DE MINormes. What right have
I to hold up that famous literary man as a specimen of the Great Bri-
tannic Literary Snob 7 MR. DE MINories is not only a man of genius,
(as you are, my dear |SMITH, though your washerwoman duns you for
her little bill,) but he has achieved those advantages of wealth which
you have not. and we should respect him as our chief and representa-
tive in the circles of the fashion. When the Choctaw Indians were
here some time ago, who was the individual whose self and house were
selected to be shown to those amiable foreigners as models of the esta-
blishment and the person of “an English gentleman?’ Of all England,
DE MINoRIEs was the man that was selected by Government as the
representative of the British aristocracy. I know it's true. I saw it
in the papers : and a nation never paid a higher compliment to a lite-
rary man.
“And I like to see him in his public position—a quill-driver, like one
of us—I like to see him because he makes our profession respected.
For what do we admire SHARspeARE so much as for his wondrous
versatility? He must have been everything he describes: Falstaff,
Miranda, Caliban, Marc Antony, Ophelia, Justice Shallow—and so I say
DE MINories must know more of politics than any man, for he has
been (or has offered to be) everything. In the morning of life Joseph
and DANIEL were sponsors for the blushing young neophyte, and held
him up at the font of freedom. It would make a pretty picture
Circumstances occasioned him to quarrel with the most venerable of
his godfathers, and to modify the opinions advanced in the generosity
of his youth. Would he have disliked a place under the Whigs 2
Even with them, it is said, the young patriot was ready to serve his
country. Where would PEEL be now had he known his value 2 I
turn from the harrowing theme, and depict to myself the disgust of the
Romans when CoRioLANUs encamped before the Porta del Popolo, and
the mortification of FRANCIs THE FIRST when he saw the Coxstable
BouhBoN opposite to him at Pavia. Raro antecedentem, &c. deseruit
pede Paena clawdo (as a certain poet remarks); and I declare I know
nothing more terrible than PEEL, at the catastrophe of a sinister
career, PEEL writhing in torture, with NEMEsis DE MINories down
upon him
T." I know nothing in LEMPRIERE's Dictionary itself, more terrific
than that picture of Godlike vengeance. What PEEL thought to
murder CANNING, did he and to escape because the murder was done
twenty years ago 7 No, no. What I PEEL thought to repeal the Corn-
laws, did he In the first place, before Cornbills or Irish bills are
settled, let us know who was it that killed Lord GEORGE BENTINck's
“relative.’ Let PEEL answer for that murder to the country, to the
weeping and innocent LoBD GEORGE, and to NEMEsis DE MINorties,
his champion. -
“I call his interference real chivalry. I regard LoRD GEoRGE's affec-
tion for his uncle-in-law as the most elegant and amiable of the quali-
ties of that bereaved young nobleman—and I am proud, dear SMITH, to
think that it is a man of letters who backs him in his disinterested
feud ; that if Lord GeoRGE is the head of the great English country
party, it is a man of letters who is viceroy over him. Happy country!
to have such a pair of saviours. Happy LoRD GEoRGE! to have such a
friend and patron—happy men of letters l to have a man out of their
ranks the chief and saviour of the nation.”
A Reflection on Moon.
WE are requested to state, that MR. Moon was not purposely absent
from the Waterloo Banquet this year. His absence was entirely owing
to circumstances over which this celebrated veteran had no control.
The fact is, MR. Moon did not receive an invitation. He was dressed
for the banquet, and did not dine till twelve, in the full expectation of
being summoned every minute to Apsley House. What makes this
matter still more singular, is, that MR. Moon has not received, the
smallest apology from the Duke for this evident neglect.

PIM LICO MENAGERIE.
PRES
* For EIGN Powers have got into a very inconvenient habit of sending
wild beasts as a present to HER Most GRACIous MAJESTY, QUEEN
VICTORIA, who not knowing what to do with the brutes, has been in
the habit of packing them off at once to the Surrey Zoological. The
Parcels Delivery seldom passes the Palace door without leaving some-
thing directed to the British Sovereign ; and frequently when the
hamper, or whatever it may be, is opened in the hall, a cassowary, a
| coatimundi, or some animal with a name that no one can pronounce,
crawls or springs out among the spectators assembled round the basket.
Hitherto the QUEEN has found in MR. TYLER a ready recipient of every
living creature that has been forwarded as a present to Buckingham
Palace, but the obliging and enterprising proprietor of the Gardens
has been compelled to announce most respectfully, that his establish-
ment is full, and that there are really no more vacancies.
It is no joke to get an extra cassowary coming down upon the

allowance of the animals every afternoon at feeding time, or a fine
polar or other bear, looking out for his daily grub at the hands of the
keepers of the Surrey Zoological. The result will be that Her Majesty
will be compelled either to reject the presents sent her from abroad, or
start a menagerie in the grounds of Buckingham Palace. The question
“Is it alive 2" will have to be asked of every one coming with a parcel
to the Palace; and word will have to be left with the sentinel on duty,
that “the nasty live thing is to go back again.”
We suggest, therefore, that Buckingham Palace should be fitted up
with a menagerie and wild beast ground, together with spots apportioned
to the giraffes for air and exercise. The effect would be pleasing to
such of the public as cannot afford to pay to see a collection of wild
beasts, for most of the animals are on a sufficiently large scale to be
visible over the top of the wall to persons walking on the outside of the
gardens. -
METROPOLITAN SPORTING.
THE sportsmen in the neighbourhood of Lambeth had an opportunity
of gratifying their taste for the chase by the escape of a fox from an
adjacent menagerie. Reynard went away in fine style over the wall of
a back yard, and was soon joined by a miscellaneous party of hounds,
who went after him as far as the Borough Road, while the view halloo
was given by a milkman, who was the first to catch a glimpse of the
enterprising animal. In a few minutes Lambeth became the field of a
vigorous fox-hunt, the pack being supported by voluntary contributions
from any stray dog who chose to join in the exciting pastime. As even-
ing drew in, the dogs fell off one by one from the pursuit, and Reynard
took up his quarters for the night in a water butt. Our sporting cor-
respondent has not sent us any particulars of the fox-hunt having been
resumed, and we must therefore presume that the “varmint" is still
concealed in the place he so cunningly selected for shelter from the
vigilance of his pursuers.
Curious Sights.
THERE are many curious sights yet in store for IBRAHIM PACHA. If
he stops a little longer in England, he may see how a minister goes
out of office, and in how short time a Cabinet can be constructed.
Should he protract his stay a day or two after this, he may also have
an opportunity of seeing how very quickly that Cabinet can be taken
to pieces again, and constructed as it was before. ,
MRS. GAME? SUGGESTS SUICIDE.
MRs. GAMP, of Shoe Lane, mumbles as follows in the Herald of the
17th inst. :— -
“What can possess him [SIR. Robertr PEEL) to ist in the endeavour to clear up
the doubtful passages of 1827, 1828, and 1829? as he no friend to remind him of a
very old proverb (“The more you stir it,” &c.), or to drag him away from an inves-
tigation which, if his heart were like those of other men, would assuredly end in a coro-
ner's inquest P'"
Thus, according to Mrs. Gamp, the Prime Minister would best vindi-
| cate his common humanity by killing himself. Under the same cir-
cumstances, Mrs. Gamp would try to blow out her brains—that she
would. However, it is a great thought, this suicide—a noble sug-
gestion. The Herald cannot make too much of it; therefore, we
would suggest that it should immediately cause to be inscribed over the
office-door the lines of Romeo:—
“And if a PEEL have need of poison now,
Here lives a caitiff wretch will sell it him.”
The poison would, no doubt, be Mrs. Gamp’s “own extract of leaders,”
which, taken in a very moderate dose, would act like the subtlest
laudanum.
INTENSITY OF THE HEAT.
*A LIMERICK correspondent assures us that so sweltering is the heat,
that the Shannon, after simmering for some weeks, has begun to boil,
| and that all the salmon fished out about dinner time can be immediately
dished up, ready boiled.

THE POWDER TAX.
(To Joseph HUME, ESQ., M.P.)
RIEND HUME,
When IBRAHIM PACHA landed the
other day at Portsmouth, he was welcomed
by the lips of cannon. A royal salute was
fired in honour of his arrival; a similar
civility was paid to the ARCHDUKE CoN-
sTANTINE ; and this, it seems, is the national
mode of asking any distinguished foreigner
how he is, an
see him. We also avail ourselves of artil-
lery to cry “Hurrah " when a prince is
born, an enemy conquered, or any other
iece of luck befals us. Now, dear HUME,
as it not occurred to you—it has to me often
—how much good gunpowder is wasted on
these occasions 7 Only think what a number
of tierces of pork might have been salted with
the saltpetre that we have thus thrown away!
I wish you would move for returns of the money that has been
burnt up in this manner during the last three years; how much on
account of Louis-PHILIPPE, of the EMPERoR of Russia, and of the
KING of SAxony respectively; and so on down to our last royal guest.
I wish, also, you would propose that some plan should be adopted for
making these demonstrations more cheaply. The same noise might be
made at much less expense. The contrivance by which thunder is
produced at the theatres, enlarged and improved, would answer the
purpose admirably. Let a monster apparatus of this kind be
established in all our dock-yards, on board our men of war, and at the
Tower. We might thus effect a considerable saving, and at the same
time pay as handsome a compliment as one which, at present, only
ends in smoke.

RAILWAY INSURANCE OFFICE.
WE are gratified to see that an old notion of ours has been carried
into execution. A Company has been actually started at Paris, to
insure persons against Railway risks and accidents. The Directors
promise to give so much for the loss of an arm, a leg-and even the
value of a burn is calculated to a nicety. They offer annuities, also,
to surviving relations, and undertake, free of expense, to bury any one
who has been killed. A similar Company in London would be very
desirable ; and we should not wonder if MR. SHILLIBEER, or some
Maison de Deuil, takes the hint and starts one. We are only afraid
that so many railways would be rated “Doubly Hazardous;” and that
a person travelling by them, would be charged at the same rate as a
Medical Insurance Office would charge a person who is on the point of
sailing for Sierra Leone.
IErraturn.
“MR. PUNCH,-You will oblige me by correcting an error that has
appeared in all the reports of my admirable, PEEL-destroying speech of
the 13th. I am reported to have said, in allusion to my friend, LoRD
GeoRGE BENTINCR, “his racy eloquence.’ This is evidently wrong. I
meant “racing eloquence;” a kind of eloquence to be commonly
enjoyed in the stables, and sometimes to be heard in the vicinity of
a hackney-coach stand.

GENTLEMEN's FASHIONS For THE RACEs, 1846.
TO A DISCERNING PUBLIC.
WE are about to advertise Rosherville Gardens, the Gravesend para-
dise, in which only “military and quadrille” musicians play the serpent.
The BARON NATHAN–eacultans suis viribus—is the M.C. The Baron still
looks very fresh. There is the same delicate decision on his brow ;
and his locks—like MEDUSA's, when they had just cast their skins—
MEDUSA, it is well known, always curling her snakes in scouring-paper,
to assist the operation—are as ever killing. But NATHAN, reversing
the fate of Orson, will be destroyed by a Bear. Had NATHAN been
merely pitted against the animal in a pas de deur, we would have given
odds upon the Baron. He would have danced with the Bear, and, no
doubt, like other dancing masters in the like circumstances, have beaten
him. But NATHAN, like the Bear, has not been purchased by Messrs.
(no, murderous barbers, no ; we will not advertise your grease
pots),-and, therefore, will not submit to be shot at Rosherville for the
amusement and instruction of the visitors.
** Messrs. [no varlets, no; we will not name you]—having purchased the two
young bears bred in the gardens, it is their intention to shoot one on this day.”
Thus, in addition to fireworks, and music, and rope-dancing ; archery,
the warbling of birds, the smell of flowers, and “HER MAJEsty standing
on a raised dais,” the enlightened public may see—not a pig killed—
but a bear shot. There is, however, an omission. Every visitor ought
to be allowed, on such occasions (for there are two bears to be shot),
to bring his gun ; pocket pistols being provided for young ladies.
Why, too, do not Messrs. the Barbers advertise that “Persons bring-
ing their own pots” may take away the grease at a reduced charge 2
Of the humanising, graceful efforts of the proprietors of Rosherville
there can be no doubt. If successful with both bears, they intend to
carry out killing on an enlarged and various scale. A slaughter-house
will be erected, and the company (for no additional charge) will enjoy
the slaughtering of oxen and sheep in every variety of killing. It is
also the intention of the proprietors to advertise a juvenile fete, when
frogs in a pond, with a plentiful supply of stones, and pins and live
cockchafers, will be provided for the youthful visitors.
The Bishop of Norwich “shocked.”
At a recent public meeting, the Bishop of Norwich said that he had
lately visited Westminster Abbey, and was “shocked to see Neptune
and Minerva, and Fame blowing her trumpet !” Now, the fact is, as
Bishops are apt to leave their churches to bless the military colours
that lead to Fame, why should not Fame return the attention, and
“blow her trumpet” in the Bishop's sanctuary 2—"Tis only blow
for blow.
An eVIL OMEN.
It is stated to be a sign of the expected resignation of the present
Ministry, that Sir JAMEs GRAHAM is about to be raised to the Peerage,
by the title of Lond PREston. We presume that the elevation of a
Cabinet Minister is considered a sign of its being all up with the
Government. We know that throwing up any insignificant object will
frequently show which way the wind blows.

divine elements are, in truth, “patronised” by the Mayor, and so,
with certain spa-waters and tonics, are the better recommended to the
use of the vulgar. Blessed City of Exeter 1 blessed with such a
Mayor, who, by his spirited attendance at Divine Service, attracts
meaner men to church, and so imparts a popularity to religion 1
And yet, there is something not altogether healthy in this curiosity,
if we carefully analyse it. On the face of the action it seemed kind in
MR. SHANDY to give the ass a macaroon. But, even while the ass was
munching the cate, what was the remorse of the philosopher ? “My
heart smites me that there was more of pleasure in the conceit of
seeing how an ass would eat a macaroon, than of benevolence in giving
him one,—which presided in the act.”
Think, ponder on it, MR. MAYor. For what—(your advertisement
makes it pretty nearly a parallel case)—what if your fellow-citizens
should say, or what is all the same, think—“Our hearts smite us that
there was more of pleasure in seeing how MR. MAYok would communi-
cate, than of true religion in the purpose that took us to the cathedral?"
Say your prayers, by all means, MR.MAYor—go to church—communi-
cate—perform all Christian observances—but they cease to be Christian
when you “blow the horn”—when you advertise them, MR. MAYor.

CORN-LAW AMENITIES.
“To swear like a lord” is an old phrase; “to scold like a lord” may,
since the Corn-Law Debate in the Peers, be added to it. Lord Ash-
BURton, for instance, spoke of “some half-clergyman, or some low per-
son—half dissenter, or some one of that sort.” Thus, with his lordship,
=|not to be of high church is to be of low standing : excellent orthodoxy!
Stout Gentleman. “What is that the only Boat you have in *"
A MAYOR AT CHURCH !
A copy of The Western Times, May 30, published in Exeter, has been
forwarded to us. Being nearly a month old, we should have thought
it a little too stale for notice, did not certain paragraphs, like spices,
embalm bodies of news for all time. The subjoined (printed in the
way of advertisement) is surely one of these conservative peppercorns:
THE Marore
URPOSES to attend Divine Service, at the Cathedral, on SUNDAY
next, at a quarter before Ten o'clock in the Forenoon precisely, and to
Communicate.
Guildhall, 25th May, 1846.
What are we–humble folks as we are—to gather from these tidings ?
There is a “mingled yarn.” of joy and fear running throughout the
announcement. Our first emotion is that of gladness, to know that
the Mayor attends Divine Service on the 25th of May; and then, a
chilliness, a faintness comes over us, with the thought that the
Mayor i, ordinarily, not a Church-goer. Otherwise, why should he
tax the corporation funds, at least three-and-sixpence, for an advertise-
ment to inform the citizens of Exeter that, at a certain time, and in a
certain pew, they may behold their Mayor—their own Mayor—at his
devotions We know that after such public fashion MR. Tyler, of
the Zoological Gardens, advertises the exhibition of some new baboon,
or rarest goose, but why should Mr. Mayor seek to make a show of
his religion ? Why should he offer himself to church-goers, as an
especial treat on the 25th of May 2 Is Divine Service, as performed
in Exeter Cathedral, so unattractive, that a “star”—a Corporation
star—is necessary to obtain a sufficient congregation? Are the folks
of Exeter so stiff-necked, so darkened, so utterly careless of their
reacher, one of the “fishers of men,” that they are not to be caught
in the Cathedral, unless he baits his apostolic hook with a Mayor 2
“The Mayor purposes to communicate 1” In a word, the Mayor
The EARL of WARwick, with his notions of Christianity, called the
agitation of the League “blasphemous !” the Corn Laws (there is,
of course, divine authority for the fact) being the especial work of
Heaven, for the benefit of the landlords. What a sharp and dangerous
weapon is the word “blasphemy l’” and how many foolish folk have
cut their fingers by flourishing it. EARL STANHope boldly denominated
the Commons' majority as “base sycophants, who, like filthy reptiles,”
&c. During the present session we have frequently thought it a pity
that a clause in the Police Act, that punishes by a fine abusive
language, might be applied to costermongers, but not to Peers and
Members of Parliament.
GRAVESEND DoNEEYS.
FRoM late proceedings of the Commissioners of Gravesend, we learn
that it has been proposed by one of their body to limit thenumber of asses
at present abounding in that town. It is evident that the proposition
originated, on the part of the mover, in the grossest spirit of self-love
and monopoly.
“To PERSONS ABOUT TO MARRY.”
IRCULARs have been sent to us--of which
the subjoined is a true copy—from the
Gretna Green Boniface. As runaway
young ladies — even of age—may not
henceforth feel disposed to trust an
English parson, fearing lest the good
man should privately send the clerk to
their aristocratic papas, and so break of
in the middle of the ceremony, leaving
the little flutterers only half-rivetted,
Punch publishes the announcement of
MR. John LINTon; he being evidently
a man not to be talked from his Hyme-
neal duty, by Earl, Marquis, or even
Duke :—
“John LINTox, Gretna Hall Inn, Gretna Green, begs to return his most sincere
thanks to those Friends who have so kindly favoured him with their Support for upwards
of Twenty Years, and respectfully informs them and the Public, that he transacts
Business at Gretna Hall, as usual, and will be most happy to see his Customers at all
times. He also begs to caution them against the tricks of Mr. HALL, of the Coffee
House, and his Post Boys, who occasionally mislead strangers, by driving them through
Gretna Green, to the village of Springfield, a small poor village half a mile from Gretna,
for the object perhaps of obtaining the greater part of the Fees paid by the Parties on
MATRIMonial Excursions. A discerning Public will at once appreciate the Creditable-
ness of such proceedings, and take their conveyance from the Bush, or the Royal Hotel,
to avoid being carried perforce elsewhere.”
It thus appears that MR. LINTox’s “customers” are so fond of the
ceremony, that they have continued to give him their support “for
upwards of twenty years.” And in the hope that they will still go on
marrying and marrying, he “will be most happy to see his customers
at all times.” We think it necessary to put our too-confiding country-
women on their guard ; for it is but too plain from the above, that
certain unprincipled individuals regularly visit Gretna as they visit
Margate; and for no other purpose than to take a new duck every
season.
