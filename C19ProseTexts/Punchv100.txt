Jtob 27, 1891.1 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVART.

Mr. Pukch was musing of many things. Mainly of his own Jubilee, or rather the Jubilee of his immortal Journal, the One
Hundredth Half-Yearly Volume of which was in his hands.
"This Show," he reflected, " demonstrates what colossal changes—many of the best of them owing their origin to
flje! have taken place since, Fifty Years ago, I penned the Preface to my First Volume, in the Year of Grace 1841!"
The search-light from the top of the Eddystone Lighthouse almost dazzled the Sage's upturned eyes, but for all that
he could hardly be mistaken in his instaut identification of a Shadowy Presence which shaped itself before him. Where
is there an Englishman who would not recognise that small but striking and spirit-suffused figure, that keen, unconquerable
glance, that ardent yet almost ascetic-looking face, that familiar star-decked uniform, that hanging coat-sleeve?
Mr. Pukch rose and doffed his hat in respectful salutation to the Illustrious Shade, murmuring as he did so—
"For gods they are, through high Jove's counsels good,
Haunting the earth, the guardians of mankind."
«« Ah," said the Shade, smiling deprecatingly, " 'twas so Mr. Southbt, in ending the story of my life, spake of ' the
spirits of the great and the wise, which continue to live and to act after them.' But things have indeed changed, Mr.
Punch, since that last went into action!" And he pointed, as he spoke, to the black and yellow poop of the Victory.
"Not so far changed, that there is a single British heart which does not thrill more at the sight of the mimic scene in
yon dimly-lighted cockpit thau at that of the huger Victoria of to-day, though it can hurl in one colossal shot as much iron
as a broadside and a half of the Victory of yours, my Admiral."
"Ah! I wonder what Benuow would have thought of ' The Mimic Naval War on the Lake'?" pursued Mr. Punch's
interlocutor. "We did not play at pitched battles, or rehearse Trafalgar with toy-ships, in our belligerent but less scienti-
fically ingenious days."
"Not much play, my Hobatio, about the encounter between the Ahnirante Lynch and the Blanco Encalada, the
other day," said Mr. Punch, smiling. '* The fact is, Admiral, a naval engagement in our Titauically-armed times must be so
complicated, so sensational and so sanguinary a drama, that a little mimic ' rehearsal' is perhaps advisable.
"Doubtless, doubtless !" murmured the Shade.
"Nevertheless," pursued Mr. Punch, cheerily, " I will wager that the model of the Victory and the Nelson Relics
will draw more British visitors to this Exhibition than all the Cyclopean wonders and Titanic marvels of the Armstrong
Gallery. Vulcan has not yet superseded Neptune iu the worship of the English-speaking peoples."
The Hero's ardent eyes gleamed with gratification.
"Doleful dumps for duffers !" cried Mr. Punch. "A stout heart is never long in the doldrums. You yourself once
lost hope for a little,—after the loss of your dexter fin at Teneriffe. 'A left-handed Admiral,' you wrote, 1 will never again

be considered as useful.' And that was before the Nile and the Baltic! Aha! but right soon ' the radiant orb suspended
in your mind's eye which urged you onward to renown' (to quote your own vivid words), resumed its star-y-pointing sway."
"You combine the dauntless pluck of Dbakb with the cheery optimism of Dwdin, Mr. Pusoh," said the Hero. "But,
the Laureate of the Victorian Navy would have other materials for his metre than Campbell, or Dibuis dealt with."
"Three-quarters of a ton of iron, hurled by the explosion of 900 lbs. of powder from the muzzle of a 110-tou gun, with
an energy equal to 55,253 foot tons, through S8 inches of iron and steel, 20 feet of the hardest oak, 5 feet of solid granite,
11 feet of concrete, and 0 feet of brick—40 feet of tough material all told! By Thor, Admiral, that ought to afford Titanic
inspiration to some lyrical Son of Thunder! We may say, indeed, parodying Campbell's immortal ode —
"Like leviathans afloat "As they hew their headlong path,
Lie our bulwarks on the brine; Fraught with shrieking, shattering death,
Scarce the rocks the Titans threw, The most bold may hold his breath
Or the bolts of Jove divine. For a time!"
Matched the missiles of to-day, immense, sublime—
"Good!" said the Shade. "It seems to me, Sir, considering the part the English Navy has played in the Eng-
lish Story, that it has hardly been adequately sung by our Bards or set forth by our Statesmen. Truly this Big Show is
something—by way of a beginning. But why should there not be a permanent Naval Exhibition, always on view, and so
ordered and arranged that every British boy shall, as a matter of course, become familiarised with the heroic memories of the
past, the great actualities of the present, and the splendid possibilities of the future?"
"Why, indeed ?" echoed Mr. Punch, musingly. "Heroic Horatio, you have accurately hit it! Of the British Boy
it may be said—
"The British Fleet he cannot Bee,
Because 'tis not in sight.
That is, the Naval history of our couutry, and its Naval needs, are not, as they should be, forced home to his intelligence by
every device of pedagogue, poet, paterfamilias, show-shaper, and statesman. When they are, we shall, perhaps, have less
official fumbling, financial waste, and Naval inefficiency."
"Look to it, Mr. Punch !" murmured the Shade of the Great Admiral, in a voice faint but emphatic, his form slowly
dislimning in the sheeu of the search-light.
"Trust me, Mighty Sailor," responded the Sage. "And as evidence of the patriotic spirit in which I shall play my
part, I present you with my own particular (and portable) ' Search-Light,'—powerful, penetrative, all-pervading. For Fifty
Years now it has periodically flared forth and lustrously illuminated the Universe. It will make clear to you many things
that perchance may strike you as obscure and nubibustic—in the Shades. At the end of my Fiftieth Volume I invited the
World to my Jubilee this year—now arrived. May I beg the favour of your presence at my Centenary ' At Home,' on the
17th of July, 1941? Meanwhile, this—and its successors—may profit and please you!"
Whereupon England's favourite Sago politely proffered to England's favourite Hero his

VOCES POPULI.
THE IMPROMPTU CHARADE-PARTY.
Scene—The Library of a Country-Home; the tables and chairs are
heaped with brocades, draperies, and properties of all kinds,
which the Ladies of the company are trying on, while the men
rack their brains for a suitable Word. la a secluded corner,
Mr. Nightingale and Miss Ross are conversing in whispers,
Mr. Whipster {Stage-Manager and Organiser—self-appointed).
No—but I say, really, you know, we must try and decide on some-
'" —i- —in i ii.>
thing—we've been out naif an hour, and the people will be getting
impatient! {To the Ladies.) Do oome and help; it's really no
use dressing up till we've settled what we're going to do. Can t
anybody think of a good Word?
Miss Larkspur. We ought to make a continuous story of it, with
the same plot and characters all through. We did that once at
the Grange, and it was awfully good—just like a regular Comedy 1
Mr. Whipster. Ah, but we've got to bit on a Word first. Come

Mr. Wh. Well, do make a suggestion, somebody I Professor,

Professor Pollen {modestly). Well, really, I've so little expe-

however; I don't know, of course, whether it will meet with
approval—{he beams at them with modest pride through his spec-
tacles)—it's " Monoootyledonous."

which has only one oup-shaped leaf, or seed-lobe. Plants with two

Mr. Wh. I don't see how we 're going to act a plant with only
one seed-lobe myself—and then the syllables—"mon"-" oh "-
"cot"-" till"—we shouldn't get done before midnight, you know 1
Prof. Pollen. (With mild pique). Well, I merely threw it out as a
suggestion. I thought it could have been made amusing. No doubt I
was wrong; no doubt.
Mr. Settee (nervously). I've thought of a word. How would—er

Mr. Wh. {severely). Now, really, Settee, do try not to footle like
this! [Mr. Settee subsides amidst general disapproval.

Mr. Wh. Gamboge, ehP Let's see how that would work: —

going to do the first syllable " Fame," eh? [Mr. Settee sulks.
Mr. Pushington. Oh, that's easy. One of us must come on as a
Poet, and all the ladies must crowd round flattering him, and making
a lot of him, asking for his autograph, and so on. I don't mind doing
the Poet myself, if nobody else feels up to it.
[He begins to dress for the part by turning his dress-coat inside
out, and putting on a turban and a Liberty sash, by way of
indicating the eccentricity of genius; the Ladies adorn them-
selves with a similar regard to realism, and even more care
for appearances.
Afteb the First Syllable.
The Performers return from the drawing-room, followed
by faint applause.
Mr. Pushington. Went capitally, that syllable, eh P (iVo response.)
You might have played up to me a little more than you .did—you

the audience—I'm no use here!
Mr. Pushington. Oh, lyes, Whipsteb, I want you to be my con-
fidential butler, and show the patients in.
[Mr. W. accepts—with a view to showing Pc8HDiaT0N that other
people can act as well as he.
Afteb the Second Syllable.
Mr. Pushingtm. Seemed to drag a little, somehow! There was no
necessity for you to make all those long soliloquies, Whipsteb. A
Dootor's confidential servant wouldn't chatter so much!
Mr. Whipster. You were so confoundedly solemn over it, I had to
put some fun in somewhere!
Mr. P. Well, you might have put it where someone could see it.
Nobody laughed.
Professor Pollen. I don't know, Mr. Pcbhtngton, why, when I
was describing my symptoms—which I can vouch for as scientifically
correct—you persisted in kicking my legs under the table—it was
unprofessional, Sir, and extremely painful!
Mr. Pushington. I was only trying to hint to you that as there
were a dozen other people to follow, it was time you cut the interview
short, Professor—that one syllable alone has taken nearly an hour.
Miss Buckram. If I had known the kind of questions you were
going to ask me, Mr. Pushington, I should certainly not have
exposed myself to them. I say no more, but I must positively decline
to appear with you again.
Mr. Pushington. Oh, but really, you know, in Charades one gets
carried away at times. I assure you, I hadn't the remotest ($c, Sfc.

Look here, I '11 be a regular impostor, don'tyou know, and all of you
come on and say what a liar I am. We ought to make that
screamingly fanny!
Afteb the Third Syllable.
Mr. Pushington. Muddled? Of course it was muddled—you all
called me a liar before I opened my mouth!

ROBERT'S XMAS BANKWET.
We held our annywal Crismus Bankwet larst Satterday. Our
prinoipel Toast of course was, "Success to the Grand Old Cop-
perashun, and may it flurrish for ewer!" with 3 times 3, and one
oheer more for the bewtifool Lady Maress,
and may she flurrish for ewer too I Ah,
we Waiters is a gallarnt race and knows
our dooty to the fairer and weaker sects
quite as well as ewen; Aldermen their-
selves. I next perposed the City Liwery
Compnys, in a speech, as Brown said, as
ort for to be printed and sircculated. I
had serttenly given a good deal of atention
to it, and praps shood have dun ewen
better if I hadn't quite forgot ewery word
of the werry last part, which, unfortnitly,
was all about the lots of money as they
gives away. Bat I remembred all about
their luvly dinners, and that was naterally more intresting to my
hordience. I was werry much pressed to say which, in my opinion,
of all the Nobel Livvery Cumpnys guv the most nobly scrumpshus
Dinners of 'em all, but I deolined, on the ground that it wood nate-
rally cause a most enormous emount of gelosy, and was of too deli-
oat and xquisit a natur to be thus publicly discussed. There was
werry considerabel diffrens of opinion about their warious choice
wines, but all agreed in prauing them werry hily, but ewen more,
the trew libberality with whioh they was served, and not poured
out so close as to make the pore Waiter's dooty a thirsty and
tanterlising one indeed.
We drank the Nobel Army of Hotel Keepers, most serttenly not
forgettin the gentlemanly Manager of the truly "Grand," as ewery -
body knows as is anybody, and drank to their great suocess, for
werry ewident reesons.
Young Frank returned thanks for the Ladies, and, with all the
reckless ordassity of a young feller of forty, was rash enuff to say,
as how as he werrily believed,_that if the prinsipleJQotel Keepers was

forgave him," more specially as he stands six foot one in his
stockings, let alone his boots. However he made up for his bad
manners by singing with his capital voice, his new Song of " Old
Robert the Waiter," being a rayther complementary Parody, as he
called it, upon "Old Simon the Cellarer," whioh was receeved with
emense aplause. So he gave, as an arnoore, the Waiter's favrite
Glee of " Mynear Van Dunk," with its fine eon wincing moral against
Teetotaling and all such cold rubbish.
Brown wound up the armony of our truly appy heavening by
singing his new song of, "The Lord Mare leads a nappy life," and
we sort our seweral nupBhal conches as happy and contented a lot as
his Lordship hisself, our werry larst drink all round being to the
follering sentiment given out by me as the prowd Chairman: "May
all the well to do in this grand old London of ours enjoy as merry a
Crismus as we have enjoyed to-night, and may they all give a kind
thort, and a liberal stump-up, to all the poor and needy who so badly
wants it this bitter weather.' Robert.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Mr. JbrokeK. Jerome,or, more'easily pronounoed, "Mr. Jerumky
Jerum," is occasionally very amusing in his book for Christmastide,
entitled Told After Supper. What he wants, that is, what he
ought to have whether he
wants it or not, is judicious
editing. Had this process
been applied to this tccen-
tric haphazard)' book,
scarcely more than a third
of it would have been pub-
lished. "His style, in this
book at least, and, for my
part," says the Baron, "I
say the same of his Three
Men in a Tub, suggests the
idea of his writing being
the work of a young man _ ,,,
who, among his companions ToU d after SuPPer- 8ubJect for a KneUe«r-
and admirers, has earned the reputation of being a 'deuced funny
chap,' and so has to struggle to live up to this reputation, or to live
it down." Jerumky Jerum still somewhat afieots Yankee humour,
not, however, in so forced and vulgar a manner as in his over-
Eraised Three Men in a Boat. Two of the Ghost Stories are
umorous, but their setting is unworthy of them. Had they been
introduced into a tale as Dickens (of whose style there is a very
palpable attempt at imitation in the description of a stormy winter's
night) brought in his story of Tom Smart, and of the inimitable
Gabriel Grub, their mirth-raising value would have been consider-
ably enhanced. As it is, these choice morsels—sandwich'd in
between heavy slabs of doughy material—stand a chance of not
being tasted. To anyone who comes across the book the Baron says,
"read about the Curate and the Card-trick, and Johnson and
Emily. The tinted paper on which it is printed is a mistake, as
are also most of the amateurish illustrations."
Woman—not "lovely woman " who " stoops to folly "—nor woman
who in our hour of ease is uncertain, coy, and hard to please. But
Woman, the weekly Woman who is doing uncommonly well and
in her fifty-third number, gave the week before Christmas, her idea
of a Christmas dinner, and, but for " sweetbread cutlets," a very
good and simple dinner it was. The same Woman gave also, among
a variety of next-day's treatments of Turkey, Turkey in Aspic.
Turkey in Europe, and Turkey in Asia—yes—but what about
"Turkey in Aspic "? It doesn't look well; muoh better in Frenoh.
But we dare say it's very good, though, for breakfast or supper,
"devilled Turkey" is "hard to beat."
I have been trying to read Leigh Hunt._ His Biography inte-
rested me muchly, and I had al ways heard, in time past, so much of his
writings, though I do not
remember ever having heard
the titles of his works men-
tioned, that, when a neat-
looking volume was sent me
by Messrs. Paterson & Co.
of Leigh Hunts Tales, I
anticipated great pleasure
from their perusal. Alas I
\ the pleasure was only in
anticipation. I have tried,
as the song says, "A little
bit here, and a little bit
there — Here a bit,
There a bit, And every-
where a bit,"—but, hang me, says the Baron, if I can taokle any
one of them. The matter doesn't interest me, and the style doesn't
fascinate me. This may be rank heresy, but I can't help it. I
have tried, and failed. Well, better to have tried, and failed, than
never to have tried at all. But I shan't try again,—at least, not
on this collection of Tales. Baron be Book-Worms.

Pars about Pictures.—A good collection of pictures and sonlp-
ture—inoluding works by Messrs. Burne-Jones, Onslow Ford,
Alfred Gilbert, W. L. Wyllie, and others—is on view at the
Royal Arcade Gallery, Old Bond Street. These are to be sold for
the benefit of the family of R. A. Ledward, the clever young
sculptor, who died only a few weeks ago. Lots more to say, but
you won't stand it, and will probably say, "Par! si bete!" So no
more at present from yours par-entaUy, Old Par.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A FORECAST FOR 1891.
(Being some Extract* from, the Gloomy Outlooker's Diary.)

Old Sol. "Happy New Year, Mr. Punch!"
Mr. P. "Hope we ehall see something more of you in future!"
January.—Continuation of " good old-fashioned winter." London
"snowed up." Locomotion by Hansom drawn by four drayhorses,
the fare from Charing Cross to Bayswater being £2 15*. Milk, 10j.
the half-pint, meat unprocurable. Riot of Dukes at the Carlton to
secure the last mutton chop on the premises, suppressed by calling out
the Guards. People in Belgravia burn their banisters for want of
coals. The Three per Cents go down to 35.
February.—Railway incursion into the centre of the Metropolis
makes progress. Sir Edward Watkin gets his line through Lords,
crosses Regent's Park, comes down Bond Street, and secures a large
centre terminus in the Green Park, with a frontage of a quarter of a
mile in Piccadilly.
March.—Football atrocities on the increase. A match is played
at the Oval between the Jaw Splitting Hovers and the Spine Cracking
Wanderers, in which nine are left dead on the field, and fifteen are
carried on stretchers to the nearest hospital.
April.—Increase of danger from electricity. A couple of large
metropolitan hotels catching fire from over-heated wires, nineteen
waiters, twenty-three policemen, and fifty-five members of the fire
brigade getting entangled in them in their efforts to extinguish the
flames, are killed on the spot, much to the satisfaction of the
holders of gas shares.
May.—The "Capital and Labour" Question reaches an acute
stage. The " Unemployed Other People's Property Rights League"
being patted on the back by philanthropists, formulate their pro-
gramme, and seize the Stock Exchange and the Mansion House.
J»ne.—The " Capital and Labour" Question reaching a still aouter
stage, 20,000 unemployed East End Lodgers break into the Bank of
England, and give a banquet to the Lord Ma you and Corporation to
celebrate the event, at which Mr. Sheriff A vgcstus Harris, in return-
ing thanks for the Arts and Sciences," says he thinks " the takings"
of their hosts must have been "enormous."
July.—Results of Gen. Booth's "Darkest England" scheme.
Triumphant return of the Submerged Tenth, who having enjoyed
themselves immensely, have come back to the Slums with a view to
having another innings at " the way out."
Augmt.—The Authorities at the Naval Exhibition wishing to
stimulate the public taste for the undertaking, fire one of the hundred-
ton guns which, "by some oversight" being loaded, sends a shell
into the City, whioh brings down the dome of St. Paul's, but, bursting
itself, lays Chelsea in ruins, and oauses the appearance of a letter in
the Times from Lord George Hamilton, Baying that the matter will
be " the subject of a searching inquiry " by his Department.
September. — A few Dukes in the Highlands, using several
Hotchkiss guns with their guests asked down to the shooting,
exceed the Known figures of any previous battue to such an extent
that birds sell in Bond Street at 34. a brace, with the result that the
whole of Scotland isj[said to be completely cleared of game for the
next seven years.
October.—The great strike of everybody commences. Nothing to
be got anywhere. Several Noblemen and Members of Parliament
meet the food" crisis by organising an Upper-class Co-operative
Society, and bring up their own cattle to London. Being, however,
unable to kill them professionally without the aid of a butcher,
they blow them up with gunpowder, and divide them with a steam-
soythe, for which proceedings they are somewhat maliciously
prosecuted by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
November.—The Strike continuing, and times being very bad,
several Peers take advantage of the 5th of the month, and make a
tour of their immediate neighbourhoods in their own arm-chairs,
thereby realising a very handsome sum in halfpence from a not
unsy mpathetio public
December.— First signs of a probable second edition of a "good
old-fashioned Christmas " recognised. General panic in consequence.
Attempt to lynch the Clerk of the Weather at Greenwich, only
frustrated by the appearance of a strong force of Police. 1891
terminates in gloomy despair.
EDWIN AND ANGELINA.
(One More Version,)
Dear Mr. Pouch,—1 beg of you to hear my tale of woe,
My oase is really one of those I'm sure you 'd like to know;
How Edwin ana myself, at last, have quarrelled and have parted,
And I am left to shed a tear—alone, and broken-hearted.
We were engaged for eighteen months—he
often said that life
Would not be worth the living, if I would
not be his wife.
My eyes, though brown, were " blue" to him,
my hair a " silken tangle,"
He'd given me his photograph, and such a
lovely bangle!
I had called upon his mother, and had often
stayed to tea-
She said that Edwin had, indeed, a luoky
catch in me.
I thought him quite a model youth—hard-working, loyal, steady,
A thrill of pleasure filled me when he wrote, "Your own, own Eddy."
Oh! a brighter and a gladder day is surely never known
Than when Edwin calls his darling Angelina his " own own."
It warmed me with the glow of love, it cheered me up when lonely,
Yet 1 didn't feel so happy, when it came to be, "Yours only."
The extra syllable indeed did not increase the charm,
I tried, however, to believe it didn't mean much harm;
So confident was I that naught our love could hurt or sever,
But it looked suspicious when next time he only put, " Yours ever."
He only called me darling once! how different from before I
Oh, could it be he liked me less (or other maiden more) P

And was he tired of me—the girl he loved so fondly, dearly?
It could not be! And then he wrote, "I am, Yours most sincerely."
Yes —was he going to fling me off as though a worn-out glove?
You can't do with Sincerity if what you need is Love!
I could not think such ill of him, although it did look queerly,
That in his next the "most" was gone, and he was mine " sincerely."
Yet even then I loved him still, for in the human breast
Hope springs eternal, so I dared to hope on for the best;
And, after all, such things as these ought not to weigh unduly.
But it was more than I could bear to nave to read, Yours truly."
The truth was clear—I quickly sent him back his lovely cartes,
His bangle, and his poetry of Cupid and bis darts.
I said to him how grieved I was his love had thus miscarried—
And then I found out everything; alas! the wretch was married
So here am I, as beautiful as anyone I know,
You couldn't get a better wife, no matter where you go.
And if you know, dear Mr. Punch, a husband, say you've seen a
Nice girl, who'd make him happy and whose name is
Angelina .
Why the Dues were they Done Away with? — Under the
beneficent influence of the early coal dews—subsequently spelt coal
dues—which have existed from the earliest times, City and Metro-
politan Improvements have sprung up into existence. Now, thanks
to ignorant, but well-meaning County Councillors, the coal dues
being abolished, up goes the price of coal, up go the rates, and there
is no surplus for improvement of any sort. If those ancient days of
coal dues were considered "hard times," then sing we, in chorus,
"Hard times, come again once more I"

You 're welcome, my lad I It is Punch'* old style
To hail with stout heart all such annual new-comers;
In winters of chill discontent he'll still smile,
His warmth seems to turn 'em to Summers!

Whose aim is to oheer up the national soul.
Surtum cor da! That motto 'a the best of the bunch;
Make it yours, young New Year, and 'twill keep up jour peoker.
Giving way to tne Blues, you may take it from Punch,
Never helped one in heart or exchequer.
Under the Mistletoe Bough
You cannot do better, I vow,
Than make that same maxim your boyhood's first rule,
As your very first tip in your very first school.
Don't look like a pedagogue, do I, my lad?
And indeed I am not an Orbilius Plagosus,
Like him who made juvenile Flaccus bo sad.
How well the Venusian knows us 1
Under the Mistletoe Bough
He never kissed maid, but somehow
Our Dickensish Season he seemed to divine
With his fondness for friendship, and laughter, and wine.
No, boy, I don't greatly believe in the birch,
(Though sometimes my bdton must play—on rogues' shoulders.)
Love's rather too apt to be left in the lurch
By Orbilian smiters and scolders.
Under the Mistletoe Bough
A kiss is best treatment, I trow.
A salute from the lips of your Punch you '11 not spurn,
And the young guests around you shall each take a turn.
The outlook, my lad, seems a little bit drear,
There are clouds and storm-shadows about the horizon,
But—well, you 're a chubby and rosy Young Year^
As ever your Punchy set eyes on.
Under the Mistletoe Bough
You look mighty kissable—now.
So here goes another, for luck like, my dear.

«< DEFENCE, NOT DEFIANCE."
"In these days of conflicts between Counsel, I
propose to make a few additions to my usual
forensic costume." — Extract from a Letter of
Mr. Welnown Kewsee, Q.C., to a young Friend.
AT THE END OF THE YEAR.
To a Fbiesu.
Do you remember how we sat,
We two, in this Bame room together
Last year, and talked of this and that,
Ana warmed our toes and cursed the
weather?
And dreamed of fame, and puffed a cloud
(We both smoked briars, I remember),
And sipped our whiskey hot, and vowed
To do or die ere next December P
We spoke without respect of Ben,
Ben who was ploughed, or very nearly;
Now Ben bamboozles jurymen,
And makes his thousand guineas yearly.
We both despised the wretohed Joe,
My fag at school, your butt at College.
Dull, elephantine, pompous, slow,
Choked with absurdly useful knowledge.
Yet Job assists to give us laws,
Speaks in the House, and shows his fat form,
'Midst empty thunders of applause,
Erect on many a Tory platform.
And poor, inconsequential Jack,
His mind a maze, like Mr. Toots's,
Has married money, keeps a hack,
And has a big account at Coutts's.
Tom owns a house in Belgrave Square,
And Dick is noted for his dinners—
Life is a race, but was it fair, [winners?
We asked, that these should be the
We, too, would win; and Heaven knows
What vows we uttered fiery-hearted,
While '89 drew to its close,
And '90 found us—so we parted.
• • • *
And here, good lack, while '90 wanes,
Our candles flaring in their sockets,
We sit onee more and count our gains—
Wrinkles, grey hairs, and empty pockets.
Yet, Heaven be thanked that made us friends;
Men prate of wealth in empty words, I
Sit here content as '90 ends.
And sip my grog, and smoke my bird's-eye.

SHADOWS FROM MISTLETOE AND HOLLY.
Deae Me. Pcnch,—I venture to address
you on a subject that I feel sure will enlist
your kind attention and sympathy. How am
I to get through Yule Tide? Ought I to give
up the dispatch of " cards," or ought I to send
them to all my relatives, friends, and acquaint-
ances? If I drop the custom, people who
like me will think I am outting them, and
persons with whom I am less popular will

Tossing up for Turkey at Christmas Time,
imagine that economy, not to say meanness,
is the cause of my ceasing to trouble the Post
Office. Suppose that I " hang the expense,"
and do send the cards. Well, I am in this
position; it is a matter of the greatest diffi-
culty to get a suitable greeting to all those
who receive my annual benediction. If I
have " Wishing you and yours every happi-
ness," with my appended name and address
lithographed, the greeting seems cold, and
even inappropriate, if addressed to, say, a
favourite Maiden Aunt; and unduly familiar
if forwarded to the acquaintance I saw for
the first time in my life the day before
yesterday. Then if I trust to the ordinary
Christmas Cards of commerce, I am often at
a loss to select an appropriate recipient for a
nest t'ul of owls, or the picture of a Clown
touching up an elderly gentleman of highly
respectable appearance with a red-hot poker!
If I get a representation of flowers, the chances
are ten to one that the accompanying lines
are of a compromising character. It is
obviously cruel to send to a recently-widowed
Uncle some verses about " Darby and Joan,"
and my Mother-in-law is not likely to feel
complimented if I forward to her a poetically
expressed suggestion that there is no plea-
sant er place than her own home—away, of
oourse, lrom her Son-in-law I And yet these
are the problems that meet the would-be Yule
Tide card distributer at every turn! I remain,
my dear Mr. Punch, yours sincerely,
One who Wishes to avoid a Row.

that have overtaxed the postal arrangements.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
IN THE LATEST STYLE.
(By Our Intrepid Interviewer.)
Fkbxino that your readers would be inte-
rested in learning Mr. Chosb's own view of
the unpleasant affair, I called upon the
distinguished Arctic Explorer jnst as he was
sitting down to breakfast.
"Now, Mr. Chosb. is it really true," I
asked, " that yon stole the umbrellas?"
The faoe of the warrior flushed angrily,
for a moment, and then regaining his com-
posure, he replied that he could not see the
point of possessing himself of articles that
would be absolutely valueless in those
extremely northern latitudes.
"That is not the question," I persisted.
"Iam sure you will forgive me, when you
remember that I speak in the name of the
Public ; but what I want, and what they want
to know is, Did you steal the umbrellas?
Now, Mr. Chosb, you can surely answer Yes
or No."
"I don't see what either you or they have
to do with it," replied the Arctic Explorer,
cutting off the top of a boiled egg, "but as a
matter of fact, I had nothing whatever to do
with any of the luggage of the expedition.
S3, if it is said, that I walked about with a
shower-protector that was not my own, you
can value the story for what it is worth.
Why, on the very faoe of it, the report is
ridiculous!"
"Exactly," I agreed, "but, then, the
world is uncharitable. However, Mr. Chosb,
perhaps you can tell me if it is true that your
Iriena and colleague, Mr. Blank, converted
an aged Esquimaux into what he termed
Ioed Greenlander?"
"I have heard the
story, certainly; but
oannot say whether it
is true or not. When
the incident is alleged
to have happened, I was
in another part of the
country, having been
sent there to ohange
novels at the local cir-
culating library."
"But would you say
it was probable f"
"Distinotly not.
Blank was a noble-
hearted, chivalrous,
merry, gladsome, gal-
lant young fellow. He
was the soul of honour.
Why," he added, with
deep emotion, "I have
left as much as [f our-
penoe in coppers] on a
mantel-pieoe alone
with him, and on my
return nave found
every halfpenny of the
monev untouched!"
"Then do you not
think he pushed the old
man into the sausage-
machine?"
"If he did, it must
have been either acci-
dentally, or to win a
wager, or perhaps as
practical joke. That he would do an
hands of the severest
is a Loamshire man I"
"So I have heard; and, now, Mr. Chosb, as I see that you have
finished your breakfast, I will put to you a purely personal question.
Is it true that you poisoned your grandmother, drowned your uncle,
stifled your niece, and hanged your brother-in-law?"
The Arctic Explorer pulled angrily at his moustache, and said
something about the reports to which I referred being exaggerated.
I take it that you have never been in gaol for picking

POLITICS UP TO DATE.
(Specimen Leader from an Irish Taper in a
Chronic Slate of Revolution.)
Wednbsdat, 9 a.m.—We appear < his morn-

hope. So far, we have been able to conduct
this journal on patriotic lines. We have
denounced the Leader of the Party as the
enemy of his country, and have applauded
his opponents as the saviours of society.
But we cannot conceal from ourselves that
the time may arrive when this policy may
be reversed. The hour may come
10 a.m.—It has! We have much pleasure
in informing our readers that, after a vigorous
fight (honourable to all who took part in it),
we have conquered. This paper is in our
hands, and henceforward we shall support,
to the best of our ability, the Leader of the
Party, and denounce the infamous pretensions
of his opponents: still, it would be unwise to
ignore the possibilities of the future. We
may be overpowered by a tyrannical majority.
The time may come

fighting to get back;
but here we are again,
ready to denounce the

opponents. For the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE AMUSING EATTLE'S NOTE-BOOK FOE 1891.
January.— If dining: out on the 1st, remember that the Queen
was created Empress of HindoBtan on that date in 1H77, although
the Opposition tried to hinder her from assuming the title. Work
this out. Lent Term commences at Oxford and Cambridge. Can't
be given away if only lent. This entertaining quibble (suitable to
five o'clock teas in Bayswater) can be applied to other topics. Note
the colours of the Universities, and bring in somehow "a fit of the
blues." On the 13th Pitt died, on the 14th Fox was born. First
date suggestive of Pitt, the seoond of pity. Good joke for the
Midlands. Put it down to 8heridan.
February. — On the 3rd Lord Salisbuby born on St. Blaise's
festival. Consequently might be expected to set the Thames on fire.
This said with a sneer, should go splendidly at a second-rate Radical
luncheon-party. On the 11th, if you receive an uncomplimentary
missive, say it is less suggestive of Valentine than Orson. This
capital jest should make you a welcome guest in places where they
laugh until the end of the month.
March.—Not much doing. On the 8th Battle of Abookir, 1801.
If you take care to pronounce the viotory A-book-er, you may pos-
sibly get a jest out of it in connection with a welshing transaction on
the turf, when you can call it " the defeat of A-book-er." Good at
a hunting-breakfast where the host is a nonagenarian, who can
observe " 1801 ?—the year of my birth I"
April.—Remember Bismabck was born on the 1st, so it can't be
"Alt Fools' Day." Work this up to amuse a spinster aunt who
reads the Times.
May.—You may say of the 1st, if it is cold, that it is a "naughty
date." If you are asked for a reason for this assertion, apologise and
explain that you meant a" Connaughly date, for it is Prince Arthur's
Birthday." The claims of loyalty should secure for this quaint
conceit a right hearty weloome. In 1812, on the 22nd, Grisi the
celebrated songstress was born. At a distance of four hundred miles
from London, in extremely unsophisticated society, you may perhaps
venture something about the notes of this far-famed artist being
like "lubrioated lightning" for evident reasons, but you must not
expect any one to laugh.
June.—The name of this month may assist you to a joke here and
there in regard to a well-known eoolesiastical lawyer and Queen's
Counsel. This will be the more valuable, as the " remarkable days"
are few and far between, according to Whitakeb.
July.—Note that on the 3rd the Dog Days commence, and that it
is sJbo the anniversary of the Battle of Sadowa. If you pronounce
the viotory "sad-hour" you should get a jest calculated to cause
merriment amongst persons who have spent the best years of their
lives on desert islands, or as Chancery Division Chief Clerks. On
the 24th the Window Tax was abolished, of which you may say that
although a'priceless boon it was only a light relief. If you can only
introduce this really clever bon mot into a speech at a wedding break
fast, a railway indignation meeting or a debate in the
House of Lords, it is sure to go with howls not to say
shrieks. Pram died on the 30th, and in founding
Pennsylvania was mightier than the sword. This an-
nouncement is the nearest approaoh to levity that in
common decency can be tolerated in a mourning coach.
August.—On the 1st, in 1834, no less than 770,280
British slaves were freed. You might ask satirioally,
how many slaves (be they husbands or be they wives)
now exist? You might offer this to a olergyman to
he used in a sermon. On the 26th, Anniversary of the
Battle of Cressy. Opportunity for saying (at the break
ing-up of an infant school) that on account of the
extremely warm reception to which the French were
welcomed on that occasion, the victory might be appro-
?riately called, "the Battle of Mustard-and-Cressy."
his will be found pleasing by a Colonial Briton home
on furlough, and an Honorary Royal Academioian living
in retirement.
September.—On the 1st, Shooting at Partridges com-
mences. Opportunity for aiming old jokes about firing
off guns without loading, killing dead birds, &c, &o.
On the 3rd, the present Lord Chancellor born in 1825—the
name of Gifkahd entombed in Hals-6ury. A little
obscure this, hut, if carefully worked out, will amply
repay time and attention. On the 9th Thomas Watts
(who may be amusingly called " Watts-his-name"), died
in 1869. Not much in this, but may possibly fill up au
awkward pause during the reading of a will, or the
arrival of fresh hot water at a newly-married lady's
initial hospitality at five o'clock tea.
October.—Fielding, the novelist, bowled out on the
8th in 1754. Battle of Agincourt on the 25th—an awful
example to habitual drunkards. Pheasant-shooting
commences. Right time to tell that story about the
Cockney who, dropping his " h's," shot peasants instead!
This well-worn jest will be still found attractive by Australians
who have spent the better part of their lives in the Bush.
November.—Good
joke still to be made
in the quieter sub-
urbs about having
special appoint-
ments for the 5th,
when one has to take
the chair at a meet-
ing whioh perambu-
lates the streets.

Chapter I.
Stiffun Orbobs was a gigantic fair-haired man, whose muscles
were like the great gnarled round heads of a beech-tree. When a
man possesses that particular shape of muscle he is sure to be a
hard nut to crack. And so
poor r at hick sen found him,
merely getting his own wretched
hack broken for his trouble.
Gorgon Goboonsen was Go-
vernor of Iceland, and lived at
Reykjavik, the capital, which
was not only little and hungry,
but was also a creeping settle-
ment with a face turned to
America. It was a poor lame
place, with its wooden feet in
the sea. Altogether a strange
capital. In the month of Althing
Gorgok took his daughter to
Thingummy-vellir, where there
were wrestling matches. It
came to the turn of Pathicksf.n
and Stiffen. Stiffen took him
with one arm; then, curling one
leg round his head and winding
the other round his waist, he
planted his head in his chest,
and crushing his ribs with one
hand he gave a mighty heave,
and clasping the ground, as
with the hoofs of an ox, he
flung him some two hundred
yards away, and went and
married Rachel the Governor's
daughter. That night he broke
Patricksfn's back, as if he had
been a stick of sugar-candy.
After this he took his wife home,
and often beat her, or set his
mother on her. But one day
she happened to mention Pat-
BiciSBir, so he fled, cowed, humiliated, cap in hand, to Manxland,
but left to her her child, her liberator, her Fason, so that she
might span her little world of shame and pain on the bridge of
Hope's own rainbow. She did this every day, and no one in all
Iceland, rugged, hungry, oold Iceland, knew how she did it. It
was a pretty trick.

on the ocean, but, like other pitchers, he went to the bad once too
often, and got broken on the rocks. Then came Kane Wads, and
Ch alsk, and M ylchref.st, and they sang hymns to him.
Ye've not lived a right life,'* said one. "Now, by me sowl,
ye've got to die," sang another. "All flesh is as grass," roared a
third. Suddenly Fason stood beside his bedside. "This," he
thought, "is my father. I must kill him." But he restrained
himself by a superhuman effort—and that was the end of Orbobs.
THE BOOK OF MICHAEL MOONKET8.
Chapter III.
Michael and Fason were both the sons of Obbobs. They were
both Homeric, and both fell in love with Greeba, who flirted out-
rageously with both. These ooinoidenoes are absolutely essential in
a tale of simple human passions. But, to be short, Greeba married
Michael, who had become First President of the second Ieelandio
Republic Thus .Greeba and Michael were at Reykjavik. Fason
followed, spurred by a blind feeling of revenge. About this time
Mrs. Fatsisteb took a dislike to her husband.
"Crinkum, orankum 1" she said. "you'd have me toil and moil
while you pat your nose at the fire.
"Roth, said Adam.
"Hoity toity!" cried she. "The house is mine. Away with
you I" So poor old Adam also
set out for Reykjavik, and the
boatmen oried after him, "Dy
banne jet oo!" and he imme-
diately jeeooed, as you shall hear.
Last, Greeba s six brothers
paoked up, and left for Reykja-
vik; ana now that we have
got all our characters safely
there, or on the way, we can
get on with the story. It may
be mentioned, however, that
Mrs. Adam found a fever in a
neglected cattle-trough. Being
a grasping woman, she caught
it, ana took it home—and it
killed her.
Chapter IV.
Red Fason meant to kill
Michael. That was plain. So
he was tried by a Bishop and
nine of his neighbours an hour
or so after the attempt. And
although the time was so short,
all the witnesses had been col-
lected, and all formalities com-
pleted. And Fason was dumb,
but great of heart, and the
[/^/Bishop condemned him to the
'sulphur-mines, for which he
soon afterwards started with his
long stride, and his shorn head,
and his pallid faoe. Upon this
the six brothers of Gbeeba
arrived, spread calumnies, and
were believed. Their names
Chapter II.
This is the Isle of Man, the island of Matt Mtlchreest, and
Nary Ckowr, bnt plenty of vultures, the island of Deemsters, and
Keys, and Kirk Maughold, and Port y Vullin. Here at the Lague
lived Adam Fatsisteb, the Deputy Governor, who had been selected
for that post because he owned five hundred hungry acres, six
hungrier sons, a face like an angel's in homespun, a flaccid figure,
and a shrewd-faced wife, named Roth. Hither came Stikfun, to
beg shelter. The footman opened the door to him, but would have
closed it had not Adam, with a lusty old oath, bidden him to let the
man in. Hereupon Stiffdn's faoe softened, and the footman's
dropped; but Obbobs, with an Icelander's inborn courtesy, picked it
up, dusted it, and returned it to its owner. Shortly afterwards,
Sttffon became a bigamist and a wrecker, and had another son,
whom, in honour of the Manxland Parliament, he christened
Michael Moonkets, and left him to be oared for by old Adam,
whose daughter's name was Greeba. Stiffotj, as I have said, was
a wrecker, a wrecker on strictly Homerio principles, but a wrecker,
nevertheless. When storm-winds blew, he was a pitoher and tosser

were Ashek, Jacob, John, Thobstan, Stean, and
preferred addressing one another as Jobbernowl,
Gombrstang, Blobbsbhbad, Nomskoll, and Blatherskite. It
sa ved time, and made things pleasant all round. Michael quarrelled
with his wife, and there is no knowing what might have happened,
if Gorgon Gorgonsen, at the head of some Danish soldiers, had
not upset the Republic, and banished Michael to the sulphur-
mines to join his brother.
THE BOOK OF RED FA80N.
Chafter V.
Poor Adam arrived too late, yet he has his use in the tale, for
his words to Gorgon Goboonsen were bitter words, such as the
cruel old Governor liked not. And he harried him, and worried
him, but without avail, for in Reykjavik money was justice, and
Adah had spent his. What availed it that a grey silt should come
up out of the deposits of his memory? That was a totally un-
marketable commodity in Reykjavik, as Adam found to his cost.
And in the end intending to snoot Michael they shot Fason. And
yet it is perfectly oertain that the next chapter of this Saga, had
there been a next, would have found all the characters once more in
the Isle of Man. For nothing is more surely established than this:
that a good (or a bad) Icelander, when he dies (or lives), goes always
to the Isle of Man, and every self-respecting Manxman returns the
oompliment by going to Iceland. And thus are Sagas ~

AUDITORS IN WONDERLAND.
"If you please," said the Auditor of the Tottenham School Board
aooounta, "would you explain to me what that curious thing is that
you have got in your hand P"
"With pleasure," replied the White Knight, who had reoently
been elected as a Member of the Board. "It's a Tellurium."
"I see that it cost the ratepayers four pounds to buy. What is
the use of it?"
"UseP" said the White Knight, in mild surprise. "Oh, it's a
most useful thing. A child who can't think of the right answer to
a question about the stars, only has to put this thing on its head—
at Examination time, you know—and it at onoe remembers all about
it. It's got Electricity or something inside it. And the shape is my
own invention."
"That's why it's oalled'a Tellurium, then," remarked the Auditor,
who could hardly help laughing, it all seemed so strange; "because,
when they put it on, the children tell you the answer you want P"
"Yes; and William Tell put an apple on his head, or on some-
body else's head, and I thought the name would remind the children
of that fact"
"Then the School must win an increased Government Grant, with
this thing to help them," said the Auditor.
"Well," said the Knight, more despondently, "they have hardly
had time to try it yet. In fact," he added, still more gloomily,
"their teachers won't let them try it. But it's really an admirable
idea, if it could be tried." Ana the White Knight fastened the
curious object on his own head, whence it immediately fell with a
crash upon the floor.
"It's too ridiculous!" exclaimed the Auditor, bursting into a
little laugh. "I declare a Hektograph would be as useful for the
children as this thing I"
"Would itP" asked the White Knight. "Does a Hektograph
work well P Then we '11 get one or two—several."
"And I notice," the Auditor went on, "that there is a thing
called a Cyclostyle put down in the accounts. Please will you tell
me what a Cyclostyle is, and what use it is for purposes of elementary
education P"
"With pleasure," replied the White Knight, who seemed quite
cheerful again; "it's an apparatus for catching cycles, if any
should take to going round and round the room when the children
are at their lessons. It does it in style, you see."
"But," said the Auditor, "it's not very likely that any cyclists
would care to wheel their maohines into a Board School, is it P"
"Not very likely, I daresay," the Knight answered, eagerly;
"but, if any do come, I don't intend that we shall be [without a
machine for catching them quickly. And the plan is my own
invention!"
"I should suppose it was," the Auditor observed. "I am sorry to
be obliged to disallow the costs of all these inventions, but the rate-
payers must not be forced to pay for fads; and, as you take such
an interest in them, I'am sure you won't mind paying for them
yourself. Good-day!"

antomime! Pantomime!! The only Drurio-
lanus, and the only Pantomime in the Tame
"West. Therefore, it is almoat a duty, let alone
a pleasure, on the part of Parents and Guardians
to take the young gentlemen from school,
schools public and private, and the young
ladies freed awhile from their Governesses, to
see Beauty and the Beast at Drury Lane. "Is
it a good Pantomime this year?" "That," as
Hamlet onoe observed, though at that parti-
cular moment he was not thinking of Panto-
mimes, nor even of his own capital little
drawing - room drama for distinguished
amateurs, entitled The Mousetrap, " that is
the question." And Mr, Punch's First Com-
missioner of Theatres can conscientiously
answer, " Yes, a decidedly good Pantomime.
If pressed further by those who " want to
know " as to whether it's the belt Pantomime he ever saw, the First Commis-
sioner answers, "No, it is not Beauty and the Beet" and he is of opinion that
he must travel, in a train of thought on the line of Memory, hack to the Paynes
and the Vokesbs in the primest of their prime, if he would recall two or three
of the very best, mind you, the very best. Pantomimes ever seen in the Tame
West. For real good rollioking fun, the Pantomimes at the Surrey and the
Grecian used to be worth the trouble
of a pilgrimage; but it was a trouble,
for the show used to commence early
and end late, and indigestion was the
consequence of a disturbed dinner and
the unaccustomed heartiness of a most
enjoyable supper.
Drury Lane Pantomime commences
at 7 '30, and is not over till 11'30, and
yet in these four hours there rarely
comes over you any sense of weariness,
except perhaps when the ballets are
too long, _ From first to last the
audience is expecting something, and
is ready to accept every transition
from one scene to another as a change
for the better. Mr. Harkt Nicholls
and Mr. Herbert Campbell are, of
course, funny to look at as the con-
ventional proud sisters; only, as they
admit in one of their duets, " it's been
done before," in Cinderella, for ex-
ample; and, by the way, in choosing
this subject of Beauty and the Beast,
all resemblance between the two stories should have been got rid of, as, up to
the Ball Scene, except for the absence of the Pumpkin and the Mice, it is diffi-
cult to distinguish between the two fairy tales. But, when last I saw Cinderella,
wasn't Rostna Voees the sprightly heroine, and her brother with the wonderful
legs the Baron T I think so: but I will not be too much of a laudator tem-
per is acti, and will be thankful that one of the youthful Commissioners

"Sure such a pair," &c.
thoroughly enjoyed this Pantomime, though he was not
absolutely certain as to what might be the effect of
ghosts and skeletons on his very little brother, aged five
or six, if he were brought to see this show. For my
part, had I at an early age seen these skeletons which
pervade the pieoe, and of whom two become elongated
ghosts, I should
have lain awake
o' nights, seen
horrible repro-
ductions on the
wall by the
glimmer of the
fire-light (spec-
tral rush-lights
were used when
I was a small
boy), screamed
for help, and
perhaps given
my own private
and practical
version of the
Ghost Scene in
Richard the
Third by not
leaping out of
bed and shouting,

Troubled Trots.
Give me another horse!" (there was
only one in the nursery, and that was a towel-horse),
but by putting my head under the bed-olothes and
shivering with fear till my nurse returned from her
supper. Suoh on me, your present brave First Commis-
sioner of Theatres, was the effeot of merely seeing the
interior of the Blue Chamber in Skelt's Scenes and
Characters, with which I used to furnish my small
theatre on the nursery table.
Well, this is all private and personal, aud not much
about the Drury Lane Pantomime, it is true; but, as
everyone will see "The Only Pantomime" (we have
reached the era of the "Onlys"), and be only too
delighted, what need I say more than that the libretto
is written by Mr. Bill-of-the-play Yardley con-
jointly with Mr. Detjeiolanus AucroB, and I daresay
it was very witty and rhythmical and poetical, though I
didn't catch much of it, and the songB were neither parti-
cularly well sung, nor remarkably humorous,—one, intro-
duced by Miss Vesta Tilly (and, therefore, for this our
joint authors are not responsible, except for permitting it
to be done), being a distinct mistake, and utterly out

of character with the part of the Prince, as written,
whioh she was representing. And, d propos of songs, the
music of this Pantomime lacks "go." Wagner borrowed
from pantomime his notion of dramatio music to carry on
the action and tell the story of serious opera; but we
don't want our Pantomimes to become Wagnerian; or,
at all events, as the lamented George Hodder would
have said, " Let's have plenty of the ' Wag,' and none
of the ' nerian.'" What he would have exactly meant
by this nobody would have known, but everyone would
have laughed, as he was one of those self-patented jesters
at whose witticisms the company laughed first and
wondered afterwards.
Dburiolanus Magnus, not content with his own
special pantomime-pie and a Drama at Covent Garden,
has had a finger,—only a little one, perhaps, and not the
thumb, with whioh Johannes Horn erics extracted the
plum,—in the Christmas pie at the Prince of Wales's
Theatre, of which the Manager is Horatius Skdgekius.

tutores, if you want to know what to take your little ohildren,
your burger children, your boys and girls to see, and what you your-
selves, familiar with your Thackeray as I take you to be, would
enjoy seeing, I say emphatically and distinctly, without any evasion,
reservation, or mental equivocation, "Go and see, and take them

There is an excellent orchestra here, playing the musical game of
"follow my leader " to perfection, and kept together, as sheep, by a
Crook. Air. Harry Monkhobss is very droll in the little he has to
do. Mr. Shale's speech as the Court Fainter is capitally given, but
there isn't enough of it. A touch more, a few more good lines, and
the speech, as a showman's speech, would have been encored. Mr. S,

of which sucoess^the name of Bowman is of good omen: and this is
almost a rhyme. The part of Prince Giglis, in the absenoe of Miss
Violet Cameron, was satisfactorily rendered by Miss Florence
Dahley. Miss Maud Holxahd looked and acted prettily as the
Princess Angelica, and Madame Amadi was quite Thackeray an in
her make-up as Countess Gruffanuff. Miss Attalte Claire entered
fully into the spirit of the merry piece; her rendering of a song with
the refrain "Ah! well-a-day!" being deservedly encored.
I must not forget, indeed, I cannot forget, Mr. Le Hay as Bulbo,
who, not only on account of his make-up being an exaot reproduc-
tion of Thackeray's sketch, gave us as good a grotesque performance
as I've seen for some considerable time. To see him on the ground
after the fight, tearing his hair out in handfulls, is something that
will shake the sides of the most sedate or blasS, and among the
audienoe that will crowd to see this juvenile show, there will be very
few sedate (I hope) and still fewer (1 am sure) blasS, It is an excellent
performance throughout. But, my dear Mr. Caholus Harris, one

word,—when you had that capitally-arranged and highly effective
scene of Bulbo going to be beheaded, why did you not carry it a
bit further, and make Bulbo on the point of kneeling down, and the
burlesque axe poised in the air, and then, but not till then, the
moment which,like the present winter, is "critical,"—then, I say,
enter the Princess with the reprieve P As it is, the effect of this
dramatically grouped scene is lessened by the absence of action, and
bulbo is off the scaffold ere the majority of the audience realise the
peril in which his life has been placed.
I must not forget the army of ohildren appearing from time to
time as courtiers, cooks, fairies, soldiers, who will be the source of
the greatest pleasure to ohildren of all ages, from " little Trots"
upwards. Nothing in this genuinely Christmas Piece is there which
can do aught but delight and amuse the young people for whom
primarily it was written. Let "all concerned in this" excellent
piece of Christmas merriment accept the congratulations and best
wishes for crowded houses—which they are sure to be for all the
Matinees—from theirs truly, Mr. P.'s First Commissioner.
Great Disappointment.—Sir Francis Sandford has created a
profound feeling of disappointment among all classes of society by
not having added, "and Merton," to his title. "Lord Sandford of
Sandford" is weak; but "Lord Sandford-and-Merton" would
have been truly noble.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
I tried Cries- Cross Lovers the other day, a Novel, in two or three
vols., I don't remember which: but those may ascertain who are not
choked off in the first hundred pages, as was the unfortunate Baron
de B.-W. He had the presence of mind to put it down in time, and,
after a few moments of refreshing repose, was, like Richard, "him-
self again," and able to tackle quite another novel.
In the English Illustrated Magazine, for this month, I have just
read a most interesting account of a visit paid by the Very Rev.
Dean of Gloucester to the Trappist Monastery of La Grande Char-
treuse, which, thanks to the marvellous spirit of the Order known
as Chartreuse Yerte or Chartreuse Jaune, is one of the Religious
Confraternities not suppressed by the Anti-monkical majority in
the French Government. The Baron—the umble individual who
now addresses you—has himself entered
within these Monastic walls, inspected the
buildings, seen all the monastio praotdoal
jokes, known as "regular cells," and has
oome away the better for the visit, with
muoh food for reflection and refection en %
route in the voiture, and with spirituous
comfort in green ana yellow bottles. This
paper, in the New Illustrated, is well worth
reading.
The Baron has for some weeks had on his
table, Golden Lines; The Story of a Woman's
Courage, by Frederick Wicks. The Baron
being, as he is bound to admit, almost human,
was warned off the book by its title, which
seems to suggest something in the tract line.
The Publishers' name (Blackwood) is, how-
ever, an invariable stamp of good metal. So the Baron picked up the
book, was attracted by the remarkably clever illustrations, and finally,
beginning at the beginning, he read to the end. It is a novel, and
one of the best published this season; and all the better for being
in one stout handsomely-printed volume. The plot is constructed
with rare skill, the writing is good, and the people all alive. If it
is Wickb's first work (and the Baron never heard of Frederick
before) he should go on making candles of the same kind. Their
illuminating power is rare.
"What shall toe play at, and how shall we play itt" The satisfac-
tory answer to these two questions, specially important at Christmas
time, will be found in Professor Hoffmann s Encyclopedia of Card
and Table Games, published by Routledge. Here you will learn
the mysteries of Go-Bang," "Reverse,"—and after learning the
latter, you, if Nature has blessed you with a tuneful voice, will be
able to sing with George Ghoswith (if he'll let you), "See me
Reverse," The motto for the Professor's book should have been the
emphatic exclamation of the street Arab, "My heye! such games!"
This is the sixth year of Hazell's Annual. Whatever informa-
tion you require it will be difficult not to find in Hazell, clearly and
not at all Hazelly expressed. A youthful friend whose pun, says the
Baron, I hereby nail to the counter, on seeing this book on my desk,
observed, "Yes, I'm nuts on Hazpll." The Baron frowned, ana
the youth withered away, as Alice did—not the one who went to
Wonderland, but an elder Alice, whom our old friend "Ben Bolt"
remembers.
Sampson Low, & Co. publish " Wild Life on a Tidal Water," by
P. H. Emerson, who gives the adventures of a house-boat and her
crew on Breydon Water in Norfolk; the photo-etchings are by
Emerson and Goodall, "and therefore," says the Baron, "All-good."
Look into Harper's for January; among the harpers, listen to
M. be Blowitz harping on the journalistic string—good; and, his
talent having served him to a pretty tune, 'tis well he should harp
on it in Harper's, The Baron hopes that M. de B. has spent a
Harpy Christmas. Allow the B. he B.-W. to draw his friends'
attention to " A Military Incident," and two other short papers, in
The CornhUl. Baron de Book-Worms.
P.S.—The Baron says he is not going to be let in for a'disquisition
on the merits of various Pocket-books; but, if asked which he affec-
tionates most as a genuine book of pockets, and for pockets, he puts
his finger to the side of his nose, and wisely replies—" Walker."
Survival of the Fittest.
(At a Trial for Murder.)
Oh, dainty produot of the March of Progress,
Oh, glorious outcome of the Course of Time,—
The watehful, well-attired Old Bailey ogress,
Still finding sweetest stimulus in—Crime!

Eiho Death has a great Ambassador who journeys through all the
land,
With a cap, and a strap, and a slip-noosed rope all ready to his hand.
He's a genial man with a joke for all, and a smile on his jovial face,
And a grip of the hand that is frank and free when he comes to the
try sting place.
And, oh, when the gloomy winter night is fading into the day,
He comes to the cell and is introduced iu a semi-official way;
With a jolly " Good morning, Ma'am," he comes, and as quick as a
morning dream
He has corded his living parcel and flung it across the stream.
The stream flows silently onward, and the flood seems deep and strong,
And some of us pause on the hither-bank slow-footed, ana linger long.
But early or late we must plunge in and battle across the tide,
Though the beckoning Bhapes look dark and grim that wait on the
farther side.
Bat they whom the King's Ambassador, or ever their race be run,
Has summoned, must leave at the moment the sight of the friendly son.
He's a kindly man, with a cheerful voice, but he never brooks delay
When once he has come and been introduced in a semi-offioial way.

With sheriffs to do his bidding, behold he is come in state.
The time is short, and the minutes fly, but ere we forget it, stay,
We must introduce the Ambassador in a semi-offioial way."
Poms Judokeht.—A correspondence has been going on in the
St. James's Gazette as to what six Gentlemen seated in a first class
railway oarriage ought to do if a Lady insists on thrusting herself
upon them. Truth says, let her stand, unless she has been invited,
and adds, that anyhow she, as an extra person, is a nuisance.
Mr. Punch agrees with a differenoe, and says that the uninvited
intruder who becomes a standing nuisanoe ought to be put down-
by somebody giving her a teat.
COMPENSATION.
(Soliloquy of Smelfungus whilst looking at the Pictorial Papers.)
Yes, it's an ill-wind "that blows nobody good,
Discomfort could hardly be greater,
For home-staying fogies of mollyish mood,
Bat think of the joy of the Skater!

When the North-Easter sounds its tieree'Blogan;
But oh, the warm flush and the ecstasy fleet
Of the fellow who rides a toboggan!

And at Hampstead and Highgate they 're " sleighing."
There is plenty of I'stuff for pictorial pens,
And boyhood at snowballs is playing.

LOST IN THE MIST OF AGES.
(Extractsfrom a Critique on an Exhibition to succeed the Ghtelphian,
in 19—.)
No. 76. Portrait of a Warrior. This picture is described in the
Catalogue as the Duke of Wellington, who, it will be remembered,
won, in the early part of the last century, the Battle of Waterloo,
and invented a new kind of boots. The face is adorned with long
blaok whiskers and moustaches, and an eyeglass not unlike the tra-
ditional portrait of the great W. E. Gladstone, Second Earl of
Bkaconskield, as depicted by a now nearly forgotten artist, called
Dundreary Sotherk, or Sothkrn Dundreary. The Duke (if,
indeed, it be the Duke) is wearing the uniform of the 3rd Middlesex
Artillery Volunteers, a corps that was raised some ten years after
His Grace's death, a fact that would argue that the painting was
either a posthumous work, or intended to represent someone else.
Accepting the alternative suggestion, the picture may hand down to
posterity the features of Burdktt Coutts (husband of the Baroness
of that name). J. L. Toole, the popular Comedian, Henry Irving
(his friend), the Rev. C. H. Spurgkon, or (and this is the most
likely hypothesis) Prince Georqb of Wales.
No. 102. Miniature of a Lady Unknown. It is impossible at this
lapse of time to identify the original of this portrait. No doubt she
belonged to a short-lived and somewhat degraded class known as
"professional beauties." In one hand she holds an instrument
called an opera -glass, whioh was used in the last century at trials
for murder at the Old Bailey. The hair she wears on her head is
evidently false, and has been supplied from some foreign peasantry.
Her hat is adorned with a stuffed bird, suggestive of the cruelty of
her nature. As she holds in her other hand a book labelled, " The
Art of Nursing," it may be oonjeotured that she is a frequent
visitor to tbe Dissecting-Room, or the Accident Ward of a London
Hospital. On the whole, perhaps, it is fortunate that her name has
not been preserved by succeeding generations. She must, indeed,
have been a contrast to her angelic descendants of the present
day.
No. 2478. An Utensil Made of Brass. This strange-looking
object may have been used by our ancestors as a helmet, or perhaps
as a fish-kettle. It is, perhaps, rather large for the first, and a
little too thick for the second. The Catalogue describes the exhibit
as " a coal-scuttle." It is impossible to verify this assertion, as ooal is
now only found in specimen cases at museums, and a sketch of a
coal-scuttle has not been seen for the last fifty years. It is, however,
interesting as suggestive of a time when the world was not heated
by volcanic hot water.
Seasonable Reply (By Our Own Politest Letter-Writer.)—
This is a model for a cautious answer at this time of year to an
invitation to witness an out-of-door ceremony, the laying of a first
■tone, &c, &c, returning to London same day:—
"Dear A , if I am (1) alive, (2) well, (3) with
no urgent business, (4) in London, and if the
weather is (i.) fine, (ii.) fairly warm, (iii.) likely to
last so. (iv.) wind 8.W., (v.) no remains of sloshy
thaw, (vi.) no frost; if there are comfortable con-
veyances to and from station; if there is a perfectly
Seasonable " on thia dry spot for me to stand on, and see and hear
Head." everything, and no draughts, and if there is a
good lunoh in a comfortable, dry, well-aired, and warmed room, with
not too many guests, and plenty of good waiters, also with dry
champagne,—say Pommery '80 or '84, for ohoioe,—then you may
expect me, and I accept, with tile greatest possible pleasure.
Yours ever, D. Dash.

The Friend's Reply.
I thought your lines a great success,
(You always did write rather
neatly)
Although I must at onot confess
I can't agree with you completely.
Of course I recollect quite well
How long we sat and smoked to-
gether,
And now our conversation fell
(As fall it will) upon the weather.
Our prospects then seemed bright
and fair,
(Our language certainly got
stronger)
We built our castles in the air,
And by degrees our drinks grew
longer.
Yes—in the game of law Ben wins,
And many guineas in he's picking,
But have yon heard his wife has
twins. Ting '<
And both of them alive and kiok-
And pompous Jos, now Joe, M. P.,
Is ioubtless pleased at growing
rauoous
Through speaking, sinoe he's proud
to be
The Member for a Tory Caucus.
Yet I'm afraid for his poor brain,
That such suooess will surely
turn it,
For every speech means so much
strain, [it!
Sinoe off by heart he has to learn
And mazy Jack, whose chance in life,
We all of us considered shady,
Has married money (and a wife):
But tell jne—do you know the lady P
Dick's dinners, too, I'm quite aware,
Are noted—yet he's far from steady,
Whilst Tom's tine house in Belgrave Square
Is mortgaged, so they say, already.
Life, after all, is surely more
Than guineas, Belgrave Square, or
dinners.
Life is a race—but yet. before
You curse your luck, are these the
winners?
• • • •
And so, old friend, content I jog
Along, amidst life's hurry-skurry,
And smoke my bird's-eye, sip my grog,
Without a care or thought to worry.

Percy. Ah, you see, Grandfather, you had more time for general
reading than we get (He looks through a practicable cottage
window.) Hallo, a Dog and a Cat. Not badly stuffed I
The G. G. Why that must be " Old Mother Hubbard." (Quoting
from memory). "Old Mother Hubbard sat in a cupboard, eating a
Christmas pie—or a bone was it?"
Percy. Don't know. It's not in Selections from British Poetry,
which we have to get up for " rep."
The Aunt (reading from Catalogue). "The absurd ambulations of
this antique person, and the equally absurd antics of her dog, need
no recapitulation." Here's " Jack the Giant Killer" next. Listen,
Bobby, to what it says about him here. (Reads.) "Itis clearly
the last transmutation of the old British legend told by Geoffrey of
Monmouth, of Corinecs the Trojan, the companion of the Trojan
Brutus, when he first settled in Britain. But more than this"—I
hope you're listening, Bobby ?—" more than this, it is quite evident,
even to the superficial student of Greek mythology, that many of
the main incidents and ornaments are borrowed from the tales of
HEsioD>nd Homer." Think of that, nowl
[Bobby thinks of it, with depression.
The G. G. (before figure of Aladdin's Uncle selling new lamps for
old). Here you are, you see 1 "Ali Saba," got 'em all here, you see.
Never read your " Arabian Nights," either! Is that the way they
bring up boys nowadays 1
Percy. Well, the faot is, Grandfather, that unless a fellow reads
that kind of thing when he's young, he doesn't get a chance after-
wards.
The Aunt (still quoting). "In the famous work," Bobby, "by which
we know MasDdi, he mentions the Persian Hezar Afsane-um-um-
mn- nor have commentators failed to notice that the occasion of the
book written for the Princess Homai resembles the story told in the
Hebrew Bible about Esther, her mother or grandmother, by some
Persian Jew two or three centuries B.C." Well, I never knew
that before! . . . This is "Sindbad and the Old Man of the Sea "—
let's see what they say about Aim. (Reads.) "Both the story of
Sindbad and the old Basque legend of Tartaro are undoubtedly bor-
rowed from the Odyssey of Homer, whose Iliad and Odyssey were
translated into Syriao in the reign of Harun-ur-Rashtj>." Dear,
dear, how interesting, now I and, Bobby, what do you think someone
says about " Jack and the Beanstalk" f He says—" this tale is an
allegory of the Teutonic Al-fader, the red hen representing the all-
producing sun; the moneybags, the fertilising rain; and the harp,
the winds." Well, I'm sure it seems likely enough, doesn't it?

OPERATIC GOSSIP.
During the preparation of Sir Arthur Sullivan's new Opera,
Ivanhoe, a grave objection to the subject occurred to him, which
was, that one of the chief personages in the dramatis persona must
be " Gilbert"- Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert. True, that Sir Brian
is the villain of the piece, but this, to Sir Abthub's generous dispo-
sition, only made matters worse. It was evident that he couldn't
change the character's name to Sir Brian de Bois-Sullivan, and
Mr. D'Oilit Casts refused to allow his name to appear in the bill
ezoept as Lessee. "I can't put him in simply as Air Brian," said
the puzzled Composer, "unless I make him an Irishman, and I
don't think my librettist will consent to take this liberty with
Scott's novel." "But the name in the Opera isn't pronounced the
same as W. 8. G.'s," objected D'Oyley. "It will be outside the

l" in it; we're both mixed up with this Guilbert." Fortunately,
the Composer and the Author made up their quarrel, and as a memento
of the happy termination to the temporary misunderstanding, Sir
Arthur, in a truly generous mood, designed to call the character
"Sir Brian de Bois-GUbert-and-Sullivan." Whether the myste-
rious librettist, whose name has only lately been breathed in the
public ear, insisted on Scott's original name being retained or not,
it is now pretty certain that there will be no departure from the
great novelist's original nomenclature.
A Breach of Veracity.—According to the papers, the Chief Secre-
tary's Lodge in Dublin is blocked with, parcels of clothing designed
for the poor in the West of Ireland, sent in response to the request of
Lord Zetland and Mr. Arthur Balfour. We understand there is
no truth in the report, that amongst the first arrivals was a parcel
containing Mr. O'Brien's br s, with a note explaining, that as he
about to go to prison again, he had no further use for the article.
Nsw Irish Drink.—The Parnellite "Split."
A REMINISCENCE OF C. K.
The excellent article in the Times on the 0th inst. upon Charles
Kekne was worthy of its subject. The writer in the P. if. G. of a
day earlier terformedhis self-imposed task with a judicious and loving
hand, and, as far as I can judge, his account of our lamented colleague
seems to be correct. As to our Carlo's Mastership in his Black -
and-White Art, there can be but one opinion among Artists. Those
who possess the whole of the Once a Week series will there find
admirable specimens of Charles Kkenf, in a more serious vein. His
most striking effects were made as if by sudden inspiration. I
remember a story which exactly illustrates my meaning. An artistic
friend was in Keene's studio, while Carlo was at work, pipe in
mouth, of course. "I can't understand," said his friend, how
you produce that effect of distance in so small a picture." "0—
um—easy enough," replied Keenf. "Look here,"—and he did
it. But when and how he gave the touch which made the effect, his
friend, following his work closely, was unable to discover. j>t c. B.

view in his inimitable " Cruise upon Wheels," and this young artist

[In a long communication which accompanied the MS. of this novel, the
Author gives a description of his literary method. We have only room for a
few extracts. "I have been accused of plagiarism. I reply that the accusa-
tion ia ridiculous. Mature is the great plagiarist, the sucker of the brains of
authors. There ia no situation, however romantic or grotesque, which Nature
does not sooner or later appropriate. Therefore the more natural an author
is, the more liable is he to envious accusations of plagiarism .......
Humour may often be detected in an absence of leg-coverings. A naval
officer is an essentially humorous object As to literary style, it can
be varied at pleasure, but the romantic Egyptian and the plain South
African are perhaps beat. In future my motto will be,'Are Langa Rider
brevit,' and a very good motto too. I like writing in couples. Personally I could
never have bothered myself to learn up all these quaint myths and literary
fairy tales, but Lav a likes it."]
Chapter I.
Mr name ia Smaixun Haltbot, a curious name for an old fellow
like me. who have been battered and knocked about all lover the
world from Yorkshire to South
Africa. I'm not!much of a hand
at writing, but, bless your heart, I
know the Bab Ballads by heart,
and I can tell you it's no end of a
joke quoting them everywhere,
especially when you quote out of
an entirely different book. I am
not a brave man, but nobody ever
was a surer shot with an Express
longbow, and no one ever killed
more Africans, men and elephants,
than I have in my time. But I do
love blood. I love it in regular
rivers all over the place, with
gashes and slashes and lopped
heads and arms and legs rolling
about everywhere. Black blood is
the best variety; I mean the blood
of black men, because nobody really
cares twopence about them, and
you can massaore several thousands
of them in half-a-dozen lines and
offend no single soul. And, after
all, I am not certain that black
men have any souls, so that makes
things safe all round, as someone
says in the Bab Ballads.
Chapter II.
I was staying with my old friend
Sir Henry Huktus last winter at
his ancestral home in Yorkshire.
We had been shooting all day with _
indifferent results, and were returning home fagged and weary with
our rifles over our shoulders. I ought to have mentioned that
Coodent—of course, you remember Captain Coodent, R.N.—was of
the party. Ever since he had found his legs so much admired by an
appreciative publio, he had worn a kilt without stockings, in order to
show them. This, however, was not done from vanity, I think, but
rather from a high sense of duty, for he felt that those who happened to
be born with personal advantages ought not to be deterred by any sense
of false modesty from gratifying the reading publio by their display.
Lord, how we had laughed to see him struggling through the ding-
ing brambles in Sir Henry's coverts with his eye-glass in his eye
and his Express at the trail. At every step his unfortunate legs had
been more and more torn, until there was literally not a scrap of
sound skin upon them anywhere. Even the beaters, a stolid lot, had
roared when old Velveteens the second keeper had brought up to
poor Coodbnt a lump of flesh from his right leg, whioh he had found
sticking on a thorn-bush in the centre of the high covert. Suddenly
Sir Henry stopped and shaded his eyes with his hand anxiously.
We all imitated him, though for my part, not being a sportsman, I
had no notion what was up. "What's the time of day, Sir
Henry P" I ventured to whisper. Sir Henry never looked at me,
but took out his massive gold Winchester repeater and consulted it
in a low voioe. "Four thirty,'' I heard him say, "they are about
due." Suddenly there was a whirring noise in the distance. "Duck,
duck 1" shouted Sir Henry, now thoroughly aroused. I im-
mediately did so, duoked right down in fact, tor I did not know
what might be coming, and I am a very timid man. At that moment
I heard a joint report from Sir Henry and Coodent. It gave on the

"Then a strange thing happened.'
whole a very favourable view of the situation, and by its light I saw
six fine mallard, four teal and three widgeon come hurtling down, as
dead as so many door-nails, and much heavier on the top of my pros-
trate body.
When I recovered Sir Henry was bending over me and pouring
brandy down my throat. Coodent was sitting on the ground bind-
ing up his legs. "My dear old friend," said Sir Henry, in his
kindest tone, this Yorkshire is too dangerous. My mind is made
up. This very night we all start for Manannakookaland. There at
least our lives will be safe."
Chapter III.
We were in Mariannakookaland. We had been there a [month
travelling on, ever on, over the parching wastes, under the scorching
African sun which all but burnt us in our treks. Our Veldt slippers
were worn out, and our pace was consequently reduced to the merest
Kraal. At rare intervals during our adventurous march, we had
seen Stars and heard of Echoes, but now not a single Kopje was left,
and we were trudging along mournfully with our blistered tongas
protruding from our mouths.
Suddenly Sir Henry spoke—" Smaixttn, my old friend," he said,
"do you see anything in the distance P"
I looked intently in the direction indicated, but could see nothing
but the horizon. "Look again," said Sir Henry. I swept the
distance with my glance. It was
a sandy, arid distance, and, natu-
rally enough, a small cloud of dust
appeared. Then a strange thing
happened. The cloud grew and
grew. It came rolling towards us
with an unearthly noise. Then it
seemed to be cleft in two, as by
lightning, and from its centre
came marching towards us a
mighty army of Amazonian war-
riors, in battle-array, chanting
the war-song of the Mariannakoo-
kas. I must confess that my first
instinct was to fly, my second to
run, my third, and beBt, to remain
rooted to the spot. When the
army came within ten yards of us,
it stopped, as if by magic, and a
stout Amazon, of forbidding aspect,
who seemed to be the Commander-
in-Chief, advanced to the front.
On her head she wore an immense
native jelibag, tricked out with
feathers; her breast was encased
in a huge silver tureene. Her waist
was encircled with a broad girdle,
in which were stuck all manner of
deadly arms, ttuhpant, sorspans,
spihts, and deeshecloutz. In her
left hand she carried a deadly-look-
ing hatter, while in her right she
brandished a massive rolinpin, a
frightful weapon, which produces
internal wounds of the most awful kind. Her regiments were simi-
larly armed, save that, in their case, the breast-covering was made
of inferior metal, and they wore no feathers in their head-dress.
The Commander held up her hand. Instantly the war-song ceased.
Then the Commander addressed us, and her voioe sounded like the
song of them that address the bulchaboys in the morning. And this
was the torque she hurled at us,—
Chapter IV.
"Oh, wanderers from a far country, I am She-who-will-never-
Obey, the (lueen of the Mariannakookas. I rule above, and in nether
regions, where there is Eternal Fire. Behold my Word goes forth,
and the Ovens are made hot, and the Kee-chtn-boi-lars are filled
with Water. Over me no Mistress holds sway. All whom I meet I
keep in subjection, save only the Weeklibuks; them I keep not down,
for they delight me. And the land over which I reign is made glad
with fat and much stored up Dripn. Who are ye, and what seek ye
here P Speak ere it be too late 1" And as she ceased the whole army
broke forth into a chorus, "She-who-will-never-Obey has spoken!
The Word is gone forth! Speak, speak 1" I confess I was alarmed,
and my fears were not diminished when two of the Skulrimehds
(a sort of native camp-follower) came up to Coodent and me, and
aotnally began to make love to us in the most forward manner.
But Sir Henry maintained his calm demeanour. "She-who-will-
never-Obey," he Baid, "we are peaceful traders. We bring no
Commission—-" how his sentence would have ended will never be
known. Certain it is that what he said roused the Amazons to a
frenzy of passion. They yelled and danced round us. "He who

brings no Commission must die 1" they shouted; and in a moment
we found ourselves bound tightly hand-and-foot, and marching as
prisoners of war in the centre of tine Mariannakookaland army.
Chapter V.
It is unnecessary to go through the details of our marvellous
escape from the lowest dungeon of the royal Palace of ScR van Taaul,
where for months we were immured on a constant diet of suet
pudding. Of course we did escape, but only after killing ten
thousand Mariannakookas, and then swimming for a mile in their
blood. Coodent brought with him a very pretty Skulrimehd who
had grown attached to him, but she drooped and pined away after he
lost his false teeth in crossing a river, and tried to replace them with
orange-peel, a trick he had learnt at school. Sir Hkmhy's fight with
She-who-will-never-Obey is still remembered. He will carry the
marks of her nails on his cheeks to his grave. I myself am tired of
wandering. "Home, Sweet Home," as the Bab Ballads have it, is
the place for me.

HOT INSIDE OTJT.
Fair Maiden, you 're looking a vision of beauty,
You may comfort yourself you've no rival to fear;
But you won't take it ill if I feel it my duty
To whisper a word of advice in your ear.
Now, the word would be this—when the daylight is dawning,
Or, at any rate, when it's more early than late,
Pray remember the coachman, who, fitfully yawning
Outside in the street, finds it weary to wait.
You reok not at all of the hours that are fleeting,
You ask for an " extra "—you can't be denied.
But though, doubtless, soft nothings may set your heart beating,
Yet they 're awfully cold for the people outside.
Want of thought, not of heart, is the reason as ever,
So if you find leisure to read through this/rhyme,
When you order your carriage, in future endeavour
To prevent any waiting—by being in time.

AN UNREHEARSED EFFECT.
(By Our Own Reciter.)
I went to see the Pantomime this Christmas in our town.
We laughed enough the opening night to bring the theatre down.
Thepiece was Burleybumbo,
the Old Giant, and hit
Men;
Fairy Starlight, Little Pop-
sey, and the Demon of the
Glen.
The Supers were collected
from the local talent
round,
And for Burleybumbo71 ser-
vant the Blaoksmith,
John, they found:
A stalwart varlet was re-
quired to carry off his
toes
To Burleybumbo Castle,
where he ate them as he
chose.
His minions, who wore
hideous masks, had
nothing much to say,
So an Irving was not
wanted to do their part of
the play.
On this eventful night the house was packed from roof to pit,
And the Manager was jubilant at having made a hit.
The Curtain drawing tlowly up, revealed a flowery glade,
In which the Fairy Starlight and her lovely maidens played. -
The wicked Demon then oame on, and round the stage did glower;
No mortal man could e'er withstand his wrath or evil power.
Last of all came Burleybumbo with his crew, a motley horde,
Oar old friend, Blacksmith John, was in attendance on his lord.
They were singing and carousing, when a man rushed in to say
That a dozen wealthy travellers were coming down that way.
The band dispersed, and hid themselves, in hopes that they might
plunder
The unsuspecting wayfarers. Alas I now oame the blunder:
Old John he wouldn't hide himself, but coolly walked about
Advancing to the footlights, he looked around—but hark! a shout:—
"Confound you! Dash my 1 Just come off! Hi, you! Who
are you f John 1"
"Not if I knowsh it, jolly old pal! I've only just come on!"
Thus saying, he lumbered round the stage. The Prompter's heart
had sunk:
No doubt about the matter—Burleybumbo's man is drunk!
"Come off! Come off!" from every wing was now the angry cry.
'' Me off, indeed! Oh, would yer? Sh'like to see the feller try!"
Burleybumbo then appeared, and vainly tried to drag him back.
John stove his pasteboard head in with a most refreshing crack.
The wicked Demon now rushed on; his supernatural might
Was very little use to him on this surprising night.
He tried to push him down the glade, but here again John sold him;
He caught the Demon round the waist, and at the Prompter bowled
him.
Ah! such a shindy ne'er was seen, such riot and such rage—
It was the finest rally" ever seen on any stage!
'Mid shrieks and cat-calls, whistles shrill, hysterics and guffaws,
They rang the Curtain down amidst uproarious applause.
The piece is still a great success, but, I regret to say,
John's name appears no longer in the bills of that fine play!
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.

The Publisher of The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine,
earnestly requests the reviewer, appealing to his heart in the reddest
of red ink, on a slip of paper pasted on to the cover of the Magazine,
not to extract and quote more than one column of "Talleyrand's
Memoirs," which appear in this
number for January. The Pub-
lisher of the C. I. M. M. does
not appeal personally to the Baron
—who is now the last, bar one, of
the Barons, and that bar one is
one at the Bar,—but, for all that,
the Baron hereby and hereon takes
his solummest Half-a-Davey or
his entire Davey, that he will
not write, engrave, or represent,
or cause to be, &o.t for purposes
of quotation, one single word,
much less line, of Tallyho—beg
pardon, of Talleyrand,—extracts
from whose memoirs are now ap-
pearing in the aforesaid C. I. M. M.
But all he will say at present is
this, that, if the seoret and private
Memoirs haven't got in them any-
thing more thrilling or startling, or out of the merest common-place,
than appears in this number of the C. I. M. M., then the Baron will Bay
that he would prefer reading such contributions as M. de Blowitz's
story of " How he became a Special," or The Pigmies of the African
Forest by Henrt M. Stanley in the same number of this Mag.
What the Baron dearly loves is, Elliot Stock-ln-tbasb 8 The
Book-worm, always most interesting to Book-worms, and almost as
interesting to Book-grubs or Book-butterflies. By the way, the
publishing offioe of The Book-worm ought to be in Grub Street. For
what sort of fish is The Book-worm an attractive bait P I suppose
there are queer fish in the Old Book trade that can take in any
number of Book-worms, as is shown from a modern instance, well
and wisely commented upon in this very number for January, No. 38,
whioh is excellent food tor worms; the whole series, indeed, must be
a very Diet of Worms. Success to the Book-worm! May it grow
to double the size, and be a glow-worm, to enlighten us in the Dye-
paths of literature. "Prosit!" says the Baron.
I would that some one would write of Browning's work as Henry
Van Dyke has written of Tennyson's. To the superficial and
cursory reader of the Laureate, the Baron, sitting by the fire on a
winter's night, the wind howling over the sea, ana the snow drifting
against the window, and being chucked in handfuls down the
chimney, and frizzling on the fire, says, get this book, published by
Elkin Mathews: ca donne d penser, and this is its great merit.
"Come into the Garden, Maud —no, thank you, not to-night; but
give me my shepherd's pipe, with the fragrant bird's-eye in it, with
tov ypoyov, while I sit by the cheerful fire, in the best of good
company—my books.
Our Mr. Grifftthes (Chister, Mayhew, Broome, and Grte-
fithes) has been all the way From Bedford Bow to Swazieland,
and has written a lively narrative of his perilous journey. He went
on a professional retainer. You don't catch Bedford Row in Swazie-
land on other terms. Being there, he kept his eyes open, saw a
good deal, and describes his impressions in racy fashion. He did not
like the coffee served en route, and was disappointed with the
Southern Cross; but on the whole enjoyed the trip. One would
naturally expeot that the price of his book would be six-and-eight-
pence, or, regarding it in the form of a letter, three-and-fourpence,
but Bradbury, Aonew, & Co. issue it at a shilling.

What words avail to honour friends departed,
Gone from the gatherings whioh so long they graced P
What phrase seems fit when comrades loyal-hearted
Mourn a loved presence late by death displaced?
No formal elegiacs fashioned coldly,
Beseem the memory of that manly soul,
Whose simple, downright spirit trod so boldly
Life's most sequestered ways from start to goal.
Not rank's trim pleasannce, nor parades of fashion
Tempted his genius; his the great highway
Where, free from courtly pride and modish passion,
Toil tramps, free humours crowd, rough wastrels stray.
Therein his magic pencil laboured gladly,
Fixing for ever on his chosen page
In forms fond memory now reviews so sadly
The crowded pageant of a passing age.
What an array! How varied a procession!
The humours of the parlour, shop, and street;
Philistia's every calling, craft, profession,
Cockneydom's cheery cheek and patter fleet.
Sootch dryness, Irish unction and cajolery,
Waiterdom's wiles, Deaoondom's pomp of port;
Rustic simplicity, domestio drollery,
The freaks of Service and the fun of Sport;
And all with such true art, so fine, unfailing,
Of touch so certain, and of oharm so fresh,
As to lend dignity to Cabmen railing.
To fustianed clods and fogies full of flesh.
Nor human humours only; who so tender
Of touch when sunny Nature out-of-doors
Wooed his deft pencil? Who like him could render
Meadow or hedgerow, turnip-field, or moor P
Snowy perspective, long suburban winding
Of bowery road-way, viUa-edged and trim.
Iron-railed city street, where gas-lamps blinding
Glare through the foggy distance dense and dun?
All with that broad free force, whose fascination
All felt, and artists most, that dexterous sleight
Whioh gave our land the unchallenged consummation
Of graphic mastery in Black-and- White.
Pleasant to dwell on, and a proud possession.
Now the tired hand that shaped that world is still,
Leaving an ineffaceable impression
Upon the age that fired its force and skill.
Honoured abroad as loved at home, how ample,
The tribute to that modest spirit paid!
To pushing quackery a high example,
A oalm rebuke to egotist parade!
Frank, loyal, unobtrusive, simple-hearted, _
Loving his book, his pipe, his song, his friend,
Peaceful he lived and peacefully departed,
A gentle life-course, with a gracious end.
Irreparable loss to Art, deep sorrow
To those bis comrades, who so loved the man,
And who had hoped for many a sunny morrow
To greet that gallant spirit in the van.
That tall, spare form, that curl-crowned head, the
knitting
Of supple hands behind it as he sat,
That quaint face-wrinkling smile like sunshine flitting,
The droll, dry comment, the quotation pat;
The small oft-loaded pipe, of anoient moulding,
The brazen box that held the well-loved weed;
Who shall forget who once was graced by holding
In friendship's clasp the hand now still indeed?
Farewell, great artist, oomrade staunch and loyal 1
Few simpler lives our feverish age hath seen.
Could pomp high-pinnacled, or trappings royal,
Add honour to the memory of Charles Keene?

THE SHAH (LEFEVRE) AND THE SULTAN.

idi a series of weeks preceding Christ-
mas, Europe was disturbed by rumours
of a momentous interview reported to
have taken place on the banks of the
unsuspecting Bosphorus. One of the
Farties to the conference was his
mperial Majesty the Sultan-. The
other was an English Statesman, the
trusted counsellor of an Ex-Premier,
and believed in family circles to be the
real author of some of his supreme
measures. The naturally retiring dis-
position of the Statesman in question,
and his inviolable reticence in respect
of any matter concerning himself, made
it difficult to arrive at the truth. Doubtless the stupendous event—the possible
oonsequences of which on European affairs Time will work out—would have
remained for ever hidden but for the ruthless action of "the London Correspon-
dents of various provincial papers, who gave in their London letters more or less
^accurate reports of the event." How they came to know anything about it
admits of only one conclusion. The Svltah mutt have told them. The event
was too important to be left to this haphazard kind of record, and, accordingly,
the Speaker has been favoured with a narrative of what took place, the signature
disclosing the fact that the other party to the interview was the Shah Lkfrvbe.
The Shah's account, regarded as a record of a historical event, is manifestly
hampered by that modest and insatiable desire for self-effacement which marks
this eminent man. We see anonymous persons who had access to the Sultan
approaching" the Shah, and " suggesting to him that he ought to apply for
an audience." We see him "declining to do so on the ground that, having taken
an active part in the agitation in England on the subject of the Bulgarian
atrocities in 1877, it would not be right that I should thrust myself on the
attention of the Sultan." It is generally thought at Stamboul and elsewhere
that Mr. Gladstone was ohiefly responsible for the memorable agitation referred
to. But the Shah is not the man to hide the truth. Also, I wished to be
free to say what I thought about the condition of Turkey on my return to
England." That was only fair to waiting England. No use the Sultan trying
to " nobble" this relentless man. So it came to pass that he went to the Palace,
reluctant, but "feeling we could not refuse such a command from the Sovereign
of the country." He talked with Chakik Pacha and Wahan Effendi; saw
the Sultan's horse; hung about for hours: no Sultan appeared; went baok to
hotel quivering under the insult. Had framed telegram ordering the British
Fleet to the Bosphorus, when Va m hkkt turned up. pale and trembling; besought
the Shah to do nothing rash; explained it was all a mistake. This followed up
by invitation to dine at the Palace the following day.
All this, and what followed at the dinner; how there were " excellent wines,
oiectrio lights, and a great display of plate"; how the Sultan, concentrating
his attention on the Shah, and forgetful of poor Fkedkrick Harbison, who had,
somehow, been elbowed into obscurity, paid court to this powerful personality;
how he received him on the dais, and now cunningly, though ineffectually, he
endeavoured to secure on the spot the evacuation of Egypt, is told in the Shah's
delicious narrative.
Mr. Punch, sharing in the thrilling interest this disclosure has created
throughout the civilised world, has been anxious to complete the record by
supplementing the Shah's account of the interview, with the Sultan's own
version. This was, at the outset, difficult. Obstacles were thrown in the way,
the forty guests, "including the Austrian Ambassador,"
looked on, green with envy.
"It's a ourious thing," said the Sultan, laying down
a book he had been reading when Our Representative
entered, that, when you were announced, I had just
come upon a reference by your great Poet to your still
greater Statesman. You know the line in Lockandkey
Hall,—
"'Oa the dreary, drear Lepbvbb! Oh the barren, barren
Shaw!"1
"That," Onr Representative writes, "is not precisely
the line as I remember it; but I make it a rule never to
correct a 8ultan."
Accordingly His Majesty proceeded: "And so, my
good Cousin, Mr. Punch, wants to know all about this
interview, the bruit of which has shaken the Universe.
His wishes are commands to me. In the first plaoe, I
will tell you (though this is not for publication), that it
was by the merest accident I had the advantage of
knowing your great countryman. I heard there had
come to Constantinople one Frederick Harrison, head
of a sect called the Positivists. I am, you know, in my
way, and within the limits of my kingdom, one of the
most absolute Positivists of the age. I wanted to see
the English apostle, and told them to ask him to dinner.
Somehow things got mixed up, and, at the preliminary
morning call, the Shah Lefevrb walked in. Had never
heard of him before, but gathered from Chakir Pacha,
who had been talking to W ah an Effendi, who, had seen
Woods Pacha, who had spent an hour with Vambeby,
upon whom Shah Lefevbb had called, that the Shah
was really the mainspring of the Liberal Party in Eng-
land, Gladstone being merely figure-head, Habcourt
in his pay, and Chamberlain suffering in exile under
his displeasure. Allah is Good 1 Here was a chanoe
thrown into my hands. I forgot all about Frederick
Harrison; tola Chaiib Pacha and Wajtan Effendi
to entertain the Shah in the ante-chamber with coffee
and cigarettes, drawing him out on Armenia and Egypt.
Meanwhile I crept under the sofa, and heard every word.
The Shah very stern about Armenia, could not be
drawn about Egypt. At end of hour and half began to
get tired under sofa; managed to stick in Wahan
Effrndi's Wellington boot a note, on which I had
written, 'Take him to see my horse. So they went off
to stable, and, as soon as coast was clear, I crept out;
shut myself up in room for rest of day. Heard after-
wards that they oame back, the Shah much impressed with
appearance of my horse; resumed conversation on Armenia
and Egypt for another hour; at last got rid of Shah.
"At night Vambert, disguised as melon-BeUer,
entered Palace and gained acoeas to my room. Told me
fearful mess had been made of matters. The Shah really
didn't care about seeing the horse; wanted to see me.
Talks about ordering round the Fleet. 'Better ask him
to dinner,' said Yambery; so despatched Grand Cham-
berlain in carriage and six. The Shah mollified; gave
him a good dinner: plenty of electric lights. Afterwards
he was good enough to see me on the dais. Tried to get
him to promise alteration in attitude of English Liberal
Party towards me; also wanted him to settle at once
withdrawal of troops from Egypt. But, though most
urbane in manner, exceedingly cautious. Not to be
drawn. Talk about Eastern statecraft! nothing to vou
English, as represented by jour Shah Lefrvres. When
I pressed him to come to point about Egypt, he said, 'On
this subjeot I can only speak my own views. I am not
authorised to speak on behalf of those I am politically
associated with, but personally I am opposed to the
occupation of Egypt by English troops.' There's an
answer for you! Your Machiavellis, your Talleyrands
not in it. Felt I had wasted some time, and given away
a dinner all for nothing, except the memory that will
ever rest with me of having been privileged to see this
remarkable man standing on my dais."
Here the Sultan clapped his hands three times, and
Our Representative, being carefully placed in a sack,
was dropped into the Bosphorus, whence he was rescued
in time to send off this despatch for publication in the
current Number.
but they were overcome by the pertinaoity and ingenuity of Our Representa-
tive, who at last found himself seated with the Sultan on the very dais from
whioh Shah Lefevbb had conferred with his Imperial Majesty whilst other of
Accident on the Ice.—The other day a gentleman,
well known in the world of Sport and Art. was skating
on the Serpentine, and fell in with a friend. Both were
getting on well when our reporter left.

"And I do not hesitate to betray to you this

Great George Street, Westminster, when there was
nobody to look at me, and have indulged in the
refreshing draught which was there afforded me,
feeling at the same time that I was not performing
any action which could eipose me to the resent-
ment or displeasure of my excellent friend whose
name is well known to you all —Sir Wilfrid

THE AMUSING RATTLE'S TOPICAL NOTE
BOOK.
(For the Use of Diners-out and other Ama-
teur Entertainers.)
The Strike in Scotland.—-You might sug-
gest, that were it in Ireland, one might see a
rail way out of .it, or rather in it. This jest
may be expected to be appreciated by a par-
son s wife of the sharper sort. Something
ought to be got out of the visit of the agitator
Burns to the North. Example of what can
be done in this direction:—" People who play
with tire (persons who go in for strikes) must
expect Bubns." However, be careful not to
say this to a Scotchman, or he may want
your blood before you get to the cigarettes.
North Britons are very jealous of the reputa-
tion of their national poet, and permit no
jokes upon the subject. You Bee, in letting
off your witticism at a Scotchman, you would
have to explain that it was a joke. You
might also nint that it was "hard lines"
for the Railway Companies concerned; but
this will provoke gloom rather than gaiety
amongst those who have invested in Cale-
donians and North British. If you talk about
the riots in connection with the movement,
you might say that the pugnacious rioters
remind you of safety matches, "for they not
only strike, but strike on the box!"
The Parnell Negociations in France.—
You can say something about O'Brien's
invitation to Mr. Parnkll to pay him an
evening visit on the French coast, reminds
you of the once popular song, "Meet me by
Moonlight, Boulogne." If you are told that
"Boulogne" should be "Alone," return,
"Preoisely—borrowed a word—Boulogne was
a loan." This ought to go with roars. At
a Smoking Concert you might suggest that
Mr. O'Briew was just the man to settle a
quarrel, because even when he was in prison
he took an absorbing interest in the proper
adjustment of breeches!
The Row at the Post Office. — As the
Savings' Bank Department has for years been
the Cinderella of the Civil Service, this is a
subject that will not create muoh interest;
however, you might possibly extract a plea-
santry out of the name of the present Post-
master-General in connection with the now-
appeased employe's. With a little trouble you
should be able to say something quite spark-
ling about what the officers " Ao« to Xaikes.'
The Portuguese Difficulty in Africa.—
Rather a good subject at a Christmas Dinner,
where relatives (on particularly affectionate
and intimate terms) are gathered together.
Say you have got to the dessert, and you start
the subject. Observe that it is fortunate that
the Sultan of Turkey is not interested in
the matter, or there would be further trouble
of a like oharaoter. To the question,'' Why ?1'
reply, taking up a bottle of red wine to point
your witticism, "would it not be a second
difficulty with the Porte, you geese t" To
make the jest perfect, connect Turkey in
Europe with the dindon avx marrons, of
which you will have just partaken.
The Weather.—-If forced to fall baok upon
this venerable subject (whioh should only be
broached in the wilds of Cornwall, or other
equally primitive spots), of course you can
speak of a hard frost being " an ice day for a
hunting-man, although he is sure to swear
at it." If the weather breaks, you may
observe, " You thaw so," but not when you
have to shout the quibble through the ear-
trumpet of a deaf old maid. And this, with
the other witticisms recorded above, should
carry you (by desire) into the middle of next
week.
A Deadly Kiss,—The Hotoh-kiss.
A PANTOMIMIC BEVEBIE.
(By a "Slippered Pantaloon.")
Tax-Gatherers molest one's door,
The streets are choked with messy mist;
I'm the proverbial Bachelor,
An old, prosaic Pessimist.
Yet somehow—who can tell me why ?—
Urged by the Past's dim Phantom, I'm
Disposed my cosy Club to fly,
And prank it at the Pantomime.
A Phantom weird of things forgot!
My mother, proud of me at her
Sweet side—our yellow chariot—
The long, long drive—the theatre—

My fear to miss —my thrill when in—
The Fairy Queen, the jolly King—
The laughter flung at Harlequin,
And Pantaloon arollicking.
And sister Pruk, and brother Tim,
(I scarcely recollected them),
Magnificent in gala trim:
Dear me, how I respected them!
I deemed them quite grown up, so bold
Seemed they, glared so defiantly:
Yet they, too, cowered to behold
Prone before Jack the Giant lie.
Yes! Where is Tim, where Prue, alack!
Where mother fondly pliant now?
Where for that matter too is Jack,
And where the grisly Giant now '(
In lonely stall, with vacant brow
I sit and eye the coryphees t
In my time they were Fairies; now
They seem to me but sorry fays.
The pageantry is twice as grand,
The wealth of wealth embarrasses;
And yet this is not elfinland
But great Augustus Harris's.
The blase children vote it flat,
When Mister Clown ories, "Here'sago!"
Yes, there's the box where erst we sat
And laughed so, sixty years ago.
The very box: I think, you know,
The reason I'm so queer to-night
Is merely because long ago
Here faces were not here to-night.
I'd best be off Bless me 1 no Clown P
No Stage ?—no Past invidious P
No Orchestra ?—but simply Brows

No Drury Lane P—no tinsel flare ?—
No pirouetting Bogeydom P—

Forgot in sleep his Fogeydom!
Welcome my Transformation Scene;

Old Bachelor like me, I ween,
May muse at times his reverie.

Chapteb I.
_ We were in mid-ocean. Over the vast expanses of the oily sea no
ripple was to be Been although Captain Babbijam kept his binoculars
levelled at the silent horizon for three-quarters of an hour by the
saloon clock. Far away in the
mmrky distance of the mysterious
empyrean, a single star flashed
with a weird brilliance down upon
the death-like stillness of the
immemorial ocean. Tet the good
old Marlintpike was rolling from
side to side and rising and falling
as if the liquid expanse were
stirred by the rush of a tempest
instead of lying as motionless as
a country congregation during
the rector's sermon. Suddenly
Captain Babbijam olosed his
binoculars with an angry snap,
and turned to me. His face
showed of a dark purple under
his white cotton night-cap.
"The silly old ship," he mut-
tered, half to himself and half to
me, "is trying to make heavy .\
weather of it: but I'll be
with her, I '11 be even with her."
"You'll find it a very odd
thing to do," I said to him,
jocosely.
He sprang at me like a sea-
horse, and reared himself to his
full height before me.
"Come, Mr. Ttjglby," he con-
tinued, speaking in a low, mean-
ing voice, " can you take a star?"
Sometimes, I answered,
humouring his strange fancy:
"but there 'a only one about, and
it seems a deuce of a long way
off—however, I'll try;" and,
with that, I reached my arm up
in the direction of the solitary
planet, which lay in the vast obscure like a small silver candlestick,
with a greenish tinge in its icy sparkling, mirrored far below in the
indigo flood of the abysmal sea, while a grey scud came sweeping up,
no one quite knew whence, and hung about the glossy face of the
silent luminary like the shreds of a wedding veil, scattered by a
honey-moon quarrel across the deep spaces far beyond the hairy
coamings of the booby-hatch.
"Fool I" said the Captain, softly, "I don't mean that. If you
oan't take a star, can you keep a watch?"
"Well, as to that, Captain, said I, half shocked and half amused
at his strange questionings, "I never take my own out in a crowd.
It's one of Dent's best, given me by my aunt, and I've had it for
nigh upon"
But the Captain had left me, and was at that moment engaged on
his after-supper occupation of jockeying a lee yard-arm, while the
first mate, Mr. Sowstib, was doing his best to keep up with his
rough commanding officer by dangling to windward on the flemish
horse, which, as it was touched in the wind and gone in the forelegs,
stumbled violently over the buttery hatchway and hurled its venture-
some rider into the hold. _ _
Chapteb II.
Oir the following morning we were all sitting in the palatial saloon
of the Marlintpike. We were all there, all the characters, that is to
say, necessary for the completion of a first class three-volume ocean
L On my right sat the cayenne-peppery Indian Colonel, a small
with a fierce face and a tight collar, who roars like a bull and

says, "Zounds, Sir," on the slightest provocation. Opposite to him
was his wife, a Roman-nosed lady, with an imperious manner, and a
Colonel-subduing way of curling her lip. On my left was the fanny
man. As usual he was of a sea-green oolour, and might be expected
at any'moment to stagger to a port-hole and call faintly for the
steward. Further down the table sat two young nincompoops,
brought on board specially in order that they might fulfil their
destiny, and fill out my story, by falling in love with the fluffy-
haired English girl who was sitting between them, and pouting
equally and simultaneously at both. There was also the stout
German who talks about "de sturm und der vales." And beside
him was the statuesque English beauty, whose eyes are of the rich
blackness of .the tropic sky, whose voice has a large assortment of
sudden notes of haughtiness, while the studied insolence of her
manner first freezes her victims and then incontinently and incon-
sistently scorches them. Eventually her proud spirit will be tamed,
probably by a storm, or a ship-wreck, or by ten days in an open boat.
I shall then secure your love, my peerless Araminta, and you will
marry me and turn out as soft and gentle as the moss-rose which now
nestles in your raven tresses. The Colonel was speaking.
"Zounds, Sir!" he was saying. "I don't know what you mean
by effects. All mine are on board.
What do you say, Mr. Tuglet T"
he went on, looking at me with a
look full of corkscrews and broken
glass, while his cholerio face
showed of a purple hue under the
effort of utterance.
"Well, Colonel," I replied, in
an off-hand way, so as not to
irritate him, "I keep my best
effects here;" and, so saying, I
produced my note - book, and
tapped it significantly. "What,
for instance, do you say to this)"'
But, what follows, needs an-
other chapter.
Chapteb III.
I found the place in my note-
book, cleared my voice, and begin.
"The ship was sailing glorioualy
under a press of oanvas. Her
foretopgallant-sail swelled to its
cotton-like hue out of the blaok
shadow of its inourving. High
aloft, the swelling squares of her
studding - sails gleamed in the
misty sheen of the pale luminary,
flinging her frosty light from
point to point of the tapering
masts, which rose, rose, rose into
the morning air, as though with
intent to pierce the glowing orb
of day, poised in the heavens like
one vast ball of liquid fire.
Through the wind-hushed spaces
of the canvas, where the fore top-
mas tstay-sail"
"I know that foretopmastsf ay-
sail," said the funny man, suddenly. I withered him with a look,
and turned over the page.
"Here," I said, "is another tip-topper. What do you think of
this for a storm ?—' The liquid acclivities were rising taller, and
more threatening. With a scream of passion the tortured ship
hurled itself at their deep-green crests. Cascades of rain, and hail,
and snow, were dashing down upon her unprotected bulwarks.
The inky sky was one vast thunder-clap, out of which the steely
shaft of an electric flash pierced its dazzling path into the heart of
the raving deep. The soud'
"I know that soud," said a hateful voice. But, before I could
annihilate its owner, the pale face of Mr. Sfilxxncs, with his dead-
eyas turned in, dashed breathlessly into the saloon. "By all that's
holy," he shouted, "the Captain's gone mad, and the crew have
thrown off all disguise. We are manned by oorang-outangs 1
Chapteb IV.
Neveh shall I forget the horrors of the scene that ensued. We
olewed up the mizzen royal, we lashed the foretop to make it spin
upon its heels. The seoond dog watch barked his shins to the bone,
and a tail of men hauled upon the halliards to mast-head the yard.
Nothing availed. We had to be wrecked and wrecked we were, and
as I clasped Akaminta's trustful head to my breast, the pale luminary
sailing through the angry wrack glittered in phantasmal splendour
on the soud which

THE SECRETS OF LITERARY COMPOSITION.
The Fair Authoress of " PaHionaie Pauline," gazing fondly at her own re/lection,
writes as follows:—
"I look into the glass, Reader. What do I see?
"I see a pair of laughing, espiigle, forget-me-not blue eyes, saucy and defiant;
a mutive little rose-bud of a mouth, with its ever-mocking moue; a tiny shell-like
ear, trying to play hide-and-seek in a tangled maze of rebellious russet gold;
while, from underneath the satin folds of a rose-thi dressing-gown, a dainty foot
peeps coyly forth in its exquisitely-pointed gold morocco slipper," 4c, Jcc.
(Vide "Passionate Pauline," by Parbleu.)
A COMING MEETING.
(Reported from the Railway Intelligence oj 1892.)
Tn k Chairman, who on opening the proceedings was received with
a feeble chorus of melancholy groans, said that he feared he had no
better Report to make to the shareholders. (" Oh! oh.'") It is true
that he had one fact to mention, which was a matter of supreme
congratulation, and he needn't say that that was that they hadn't
yielded a single inch to the men. (" Oh! oh!" and a Voice,
"Oh! vie've had enough of that'! ") It is also true that this firm
and unflinching front had necessitated some sacrifice, and had
involved the Company in no little difficulty. (Prolonged groans.)
He was sorry to note these manifestations, for he had not only to
announce to that meeting the non-payment of any dividend, even
to the holders of the Company's Debenture Stock, but he had further
to inform them, that, owing to some difficulty in settling the account
of their coal contractors, these last had taken proceedings against
them, and had seized not only all the contents of their refreshment-
rooms, but also the whole of their rolling-stock. (Prolonged wailing.)
He grieved to say that the last two engines that the Company
possessed, and which they had up to now hidden in the oloak-room
at the Edinburgh terminus, were unfortunately discovered and
seized last night. (Groans.) Still, the Company did not despair of
being able to carry on, at least, a portion of the Passenger Traffic.
iFeeble laughter.) They might meet the statement with a moni-
es t&tion of ridicule—but such was the case. It was with a sense of
pride in their method of triumphing over difficulties, that he
announced to the meeting, that a train of cattle-trucks would be
started for the North daily at twelve o'clook, the motive power of
which would be the Directors themselves. (" Oh! oh!*) They
could not say anything about the pace at which the train would
travel, but that, with time, it would do the distanoe he had little, if
any doubt. It is true that in a similar experiment on a neighbouring
line the train came to a dead halt in the first tunnel, and the pas-
sengers had to descend in the dark and grope their way out to the
nearest station as well as they could, but this unsatisfactory experience
would in no way deter them from making the experiment on their own
behalf. (Jeers.) He was sorry to see that the ordinarv stock of the Com-
pany, which, a twelvemonth since, had touched 128|,—oould not now
find purchasers in theMarket at"i. (Groans.) But he hoped for better
times. (" Oh.' oh !") But, come what would, he would hold fast
by his principles, whioh were, "No Compromise, No Meeting Half-
way, No Arbitration, No Concession.'" Men might starve, Trade
collapse, the Country come to ruin, the Company disappear in
Bankruptcy, but he cared not. The Directors had put their foot
down, and, whether right or wrong, whatever happened, there they
meant, with a good down-right national and pig-headed obstinacy,
to keep it.
The Chairman was continuing in this strain, but, being interrupted
by a shower of inkstands, was compelled to olose his remarks, the
proceedings coming to a somewhat abrupt conclusion, in a scene of
considerable confusion.
The "Strait" Tip.
Oh. Mister Blahtb, we don't oomplain
That for your country's weal you 're oaring;
Bnt, clever Yankee, Punch would think 'ee
Not to be quite so over- Behring!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [January 24, 1891.
THE GAME OF PEACE.
April.—Grand informal meeting of the Crowned Heads of Europe
(with the Czar in the ohair) to discuss a scheme of general disarma-
ment, at which the Emperor of Germ ant creates a profound sensation
by the announcement that, as a hint to his brother Monarch s, he has
himself gone on to the retired list, burnt
his cocked-hat, disbanded the Pomeranian
Grenadiers, and confined Herr KHurr
for ten years in a second-class fortress.
May.—By arrangement, all the great
powers call in the uniforms of all their
troops and present them to the King of
the Belgians, on the understanding that,
as the Emperor of the Congo, he shall
forthwith transport them to Africa, and
instantly commence the clothing of seven
millions of the naked native population.
June.— One hundred and eighty thou-
sand horses, with military training,
coming suddenly on to the market, four-
in-hand Hansoms at a penny an hour,
become common in all the great European
capitals, and the Derby, for which there
are 1371 entries, is won by a Cossack
pony, trained in Siberia.
July.—The barrels of all the magazine
rifles melted down, and recast, utilised
for the production of type-writers, whioh,
being produced in large quantities, are
supplied with instruction gratia to all
the children attending the establish-
ments of the London School Board, the
stocks of the rifles being utilised for the
manufacture of billiard-cues, walking-
sticks, and umbrella-handles.
August.—It being resolved to use up all the gunpowder without
delay, a perpetual display of fireworks is inaugurated at Vienna,
St. Petersburg, Berlin, Paris, and London, the show in the last-
named capital including a gigantic set-piece of the Fifteen Decisive
Battles of the World, which is given five times successively every
evening at the Crystal Palace for three months, Piccadilly being
illuminated from 6 p.m. to 3 a.m. by the continuous discharge of
coloured rockets.
September.—The last 101-ton gun having been melted down for
the forging of the metal piles for one of the four newly-projeoted
Channel bridges, a nasty international feeling, fermented by General
Ofnoers who are obliged to sweep crossings and drive four-wheeled
oabs for a livelihood,—and who do not like it,—begins to manifest
itself, and diplomacy intervening irritably only to make matters
worse, several ultimatums are dispatched from some of the Great

worse, i
Powers to others, but owing to the want of soldiers, the matter is put
into the hands of International Solicitors, who, arranging a
stand-up fight for the President of the French Republic and the
Czar against the Emperors of Germany and Austria, and the King
of Italy, the matter somehow falls through for the moment, and the
pnblio excitement subsides.
October.—General note from all the Great Powers to each other
announcing their secession from the "League of Peace," and declar-
ing their intention of resorting again to " Protective Armament" as
soon as possible. War declared all round before the end of the month.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.

There was a bronze group by Pollet among the specimens of
sculpture in the French Salon, some twenty years ago,—" It may
be more or less an hour or so, as the poet sings,—representing a
'form being carried upwards in the embrace of a rather evil-
looking Angel. It illustrated a
poem by the Vicomte Alfred de
vignt, which I remember read-
ing, in consequence of this very
statue having come into my pos-
session (it was afterwards sold at
Messrs. Christie, Maxson &
Woods, under the style and title
of "Lot 121, EUa"), and it
occurs to me .that it was on pre-
cisely the same theme as the
■Aher Alfred's—not the Vicomte
but Muter Alfred Austin's —
"The Tower of Babel," whioh
I have just read with much plea-
sure, and, with some profit; the
moral, as I take it, being favour-
able to the Temperance cause, as a
warning against all spirits, good,
bad, or indifferent. Afrael, the inhabitant of a distant star, falls
in love with Noema, the wife of the atheistical Babelite Aran, to
whom she has borne a son, aged in the poem, as far as I can make
out, about eight years, and a fine boy for that. _ Anyhow, it makes
Noema at least twenty-five, supposing she married at sweet seven-
teen, and, indeed, she alludes to herself in the poem as no longer in
her first youth.
Well, Aran, who is very far from being a domestic charaoter, is
struck down by avenging lightning at the destruction of the Tower
of Babel, and Noema is left a widow, with her child, who has been
protected in the melie by the Spirit Afrael's taking him out of it, and
restoring him to his mother's arms. When, after this, the infatu-
ated spirit-lover A frael requests Noema to say the word whioh shall
make a man of him, and a husband of him too at the same time,
she modestly refuses, until she has had a decent time to order her
widow's weeds at her milliner's and wear them for about a month or
so, at the expiration of which interval Afrael may, if he be still of
the same mind, call in again, and pop the question.
Afrael bids good-bye to the Upper House, and, his heart being ever
true to Poll—meaning Noema—he returns, makes an evening call
upon her, and asks her, in effect, "Is it to be 'Yet-ema,' or
'No-ema f" The bashful widow chooses the former, and the Spirit-
"Afrael, renouncing his immortality, i.e., giving up spirits,
ies plain Mr. Afrael, and an ordinary, as far as anybody can
judge, a very ordinary mortal, showing what a change a drop of
spirits can effect in a constitution. Now I should like the poem "con-
tinued in our next." I should like to hear how they got on together;
and, as longevity was considerable in those patriarchal days, I should
like to know how they got on together when Afrael Esquire was 195,
and his wife, Noema, was 200. Did Afrael never again take to his
spirits? Or, did he become miserable and hipped having entirely lost his
spirits? Did his wife never make sarcastic referenoe to the "stars"
I with whom he had formerly been acquainted P And how about her boy,
bis step-son P Did they have any family P. Whence came the money?
Perhaps Mr. Aukkd Austin (whose works are being printed by
Macmillan in a collected form, and among them The Satire now
historic) will give ns an entirely new volume on the same subject,
telling an expectant public all about Mr, and Mn. Afrael chet
eux, and, in fact, something spicy about this strangely assorted
couplei; for Poet Alfred will do well to remember and act upon his
own dictum when, in the prefaoa to The Satire, he observed, and
with truth, that had he originally "written with the grave decorum
of a secluded moralist, he would" by this time, "have gone down
into the limbo of forgotten bores."
Into that limbo A. A. will never descend. It is delightful to find
him dedicating his book to Lord Litton, to whom—when L. L.
was Owen Meredith, Alfredo mio had pointed out that, "in one
serious particular, he had overlooked parental admonition," and
observing on that occasion that, "had Owen Meredith even a
glimpse of the truth, we" (A. A. himself, in 1861, muoh "we"-er
then than now—" et alors, il grandira, U grandira.'") "should have
been spared the final tableau of repentance and forgiveness which
concludes Luetic." But, thank goodness, we (the Baron, and. his
literary friends) have not been spared the touching picture of
repentance and forgiveness in Alfred Austin's dedicating his
latest poem to Lord Litton. Sic transit ira poetarum!
In The Season Alfredo sang—
"I claim the precious privilege of youth,
Never to speak except to speak the truth."
But those lines were not written the day before yesterday, and as
he can no longer " claim" the aforesaid "precious privilege," he can
in his more mature years " go as he pleases." And there is so muoh
"go" in him that he always pleases; so the Baron anticipates the
sequel to The Tower of Babel on the lines already suggested, pre-
sumptuous as it may seem to suggest lines to a poet.
Phra the Phcenician, a very clever idea, with which Bulwer
would have performed mysteriously thrilling wonders, but whioh
Mr. Arnold has written at onoe too heavily and treated too lightly,
in too much of a " so-called nineteenth century style;" which is a
pity, as it is full of dramatic inoident, and the interest well kept up
through some two thousand years or so, more or less. He is a
wonder is Mister Phra, and might well be called Phra Diavolo
instead of Phra the Phcenician. Sir Edwin Arnold has written a
preface to the volume, and seems to express a wish that the wonders
here recorded could be possibilities of everyday life. But, if so, as
Mr. Weller, Senior, observed, d propos of " there being a Providenoe
in it," "0' course there is, Sammy ; or what 'ud become o' the under-
takers P" And as to cremation—well, such an utter corporeal extinc-
tion would be the only way of putting an end to the terrestrial
existence of Phra the Phoenician, who, however, "might rise," as
Mrs. Malaprop would say, "like a Phoenician from the ashes."
The appearance of A New Lady Audlty is rather late in the half-
century as a " skit" on Miss Br addon's celebrated novel. Now and
then I found an amusing bit in it, bat, on the whole, poor stuff,
says The Baron de Book-Worms.
My faithful "Co." has been reading poetry and prose, and thus com-
municates the result of his studies:—There is genuine but unassum-
ing poetry, whioh is, after all, only another way of saying fine
feeling finely expressed, in Corn and Poppies, by Cosmo Monkhousb
(Elkin Mathews). Much of the verse is musical, and there is
throughout a vein of thoughtfulness which never degenerates into a
morbid brooding. I commend particularly1' Any Soul to any Body,"
"A Dead March," and "Mysteries," as good examples of Mr.
Monkhouse's style. So much for verse. Let me now to prose.
Like my baronial Chief, I say, "Bring me my boots!" and let them
be thick, so that I may trudge safely through Mr. Kody.'rd
KlPLiNQ's.latest, "The Light that Failed" (Lippincott's Monthly
Magazine, January). This is described as Mr. Kipling's first
long story. His publishers, moreover, are good enough to take all
the trouble of criticism upon their own shoulders. They declare
that "there is more stern strength in this novel than in anything
which Mr. Kipling has written;" but that is, after all, only a com-
parative statement, whioh profits me little, as I never yet estimated
the amount of " stern strength" in Mr. Kipling's previous writings.
I am, however, told, in addition, that the tale " is as intensely moving
as it is intensely masculine" (there's lovely language!) "and it
will not be surprising if it should prove to be the literary sensation
of the year." To suoh an expression of opinion by competent judges
it would be futile to attempt to add very muoh. I will only say,
therefore, that the " sensation" produced in me by this novel is one
of the most disagreeable I ever experienced. The characters are,
for the most part, inordinately dull, preposterously conceited, and
insufferably brutal. As for Dick Heldar, the hero, no more dis-
agreeable and hateful bully-puppy ever thought and talked in discon-
nected gasps through ninety-seven pages. The catastrophe moves
no pity. Mr. Kipling seems to despise the public, "who think
with their boots, and read with their elbows;" but so olever a man
might surely show his contempt less crudely. Kipling, I love'thee,
but never mare write such another tale!

cultivation of tubercle bacilli, the local effeot of which, when
injected into a healthy guinea-pig, produces a nodule found at the
point of inoculation, which, when a second punoture is perpetrated,
causes what may be called the bacillary fluid to be brought into the
current of its oiroulalion, so that the infected tissue may react upon
the agent which it had previously been able to resist. I am not
quite sure that I have got the exact words, bat that's the idea.

DOMESTIC MELODIES.
{By Sancho Preston Panxa.)
WINTER BATH-SONG.
Fob weeks the sun eaoh mom arose
As 'tis his nature to,
Bat little difference he made
Sopp'd by the fog's asthmatics shade;
From day's beginning till its elose
The day no brighter grew.
Above the sheets, the sleeper's l
Peep'd shyly, as afraid,
While 'neath the dark and dranghty fine
The burnt-out cinders meanly strew
The hearth, where now no firelight glows,
No waiting warmth is laid.
Fall many a morn I sprang from bed,
As o'er the deadly brink
The wretch, with courage of despair,
Leaps from the slimy river-stair,
By hopeless hope unthinking sped,
Ere he can pause to think.
Cold as the efforts of the dead,
The needle-atom'd air,
Impinged upon the limbs that shrink.
On shivering shanks, and eyelids pink,
And bound its bands about the head,
And chill'd the underwear.
The frost that held us in its grip,
Would raise the prisoning paw,
And Nature, like a mouse set free,
Eojoyed delusive liberty,
While every water-pipe must drip
To greet the passing thaw.
Then rudely dashed from eager lip
The cup of joy would be,
And fingers numbed, and (shattering jaw,
Owned unexpelled the winter's flaw,
And on the steps the goodmen slip,
And shout the major D.
Long like a fossil tipsy-cake
The sponge eaoh morn appeared;
The bath, if plenished over-night,
Was frozen ere the morning light,
And more that frigid water-acne
Thau unwashed days I feared.
Now while the milder zephyrs shake
Onoe more the winter's might.
My sponge, my bath, by loss endeared,
Shall dree no more a lonely weird;
And as young ducks to water take,
Shall be my bath ward flight.
Good Devon!
Mr. T. H. Smith will return to Grosvenor Place
from Torquay on Monday, for tke opening of Par-
liament.
'Tis pity of you, Old Mobalitt,
Back from your rest to loud banality.
After St. Stephen's shindy, Devon
No donbt appeared a very heaven:
But cream s as muoh like water chalky

CHANGE OF INITIALS.
"Often as I may have been invited,"
Mr. T. If. ITealt is reported to have said, in

A WORD TO MOTHERS.
[A well-known Bramatio Critic has recently
spoken of a play as'Murt the play in which grow-
ing girls will delight."]
0 anxious Mothers, *ome and listen
To what just now I've got to say.
If I'm not wrong, your eyes will glisten
Before the end of this my lay.
With strong affection overflowing—
Your children are indeed your pearls—
You can't help feeling pleased at knowing
The play '• the thing—for growing girls!
The pages of a lady's journal
I've very often read with oare,
The news, the gossiping eternal,
You 're always sure of getting there.
Of how you ought to bind your tresses,
The latest styles, the tint in hair,
And there I've seen the kind of dresses
It's right for growing girls to wear.
But never once the slightest mention
Of what they'd better go and see.
And yet it's clear that some attention
To such a thing there ought to be.
For sentiment and love they 're frantio,
They're fond of knights and belted earls,
A play that's just the least romantio—
Yes, that's the play for growing girls.
A crowing child, who loves to prattle,
Can easily be kept at rest.
You've only got to get a rattle,
Or p'raps a dolly would be best.
A bouncing boy will blow a bubble,
And want no more the livelong day;
But if a growing girl gives trouble,
You've got to take her to the play!

A PIONEER IN PETTICOATS.
[An American Lady if about to explore Africa, on humane principles.]
Arrive in Africa.—Convinoed that real way of taming the savage
heart is by Feminine Tact. No need of brutal habits of male
adventurers. Two negresses, from "Ole Virginny," with me, who
said they would like to "see Africa
again"; a few Arabs, to carry our bag-
gage. Intend to study home- life of African
tribes, and to get them to talk into my
phonograph.
Month Later.—Have had to exhibit more
Feminine Tact than I expected. Got en-
tangled in swampy forest on Zambesi (I
think), and Arabs declined to extrioate us
unless their pay was doubled 1 Also one of
negresses — horrid woman 1 — has deserted
me—come to place that she pretended to
jo recognise as her native village, and said she
meant to stay I Taot useless with females!
On Lake Tanganyika—or if it isn't Lake Tanganyika, it's on
entirely new lake,—whioh I have been the first to discover'. Suffer a
good deal from fever and queer diet. Am studying native home-life.
. Later.—Have left two Arabs and my remaining negress on Lake,
and gone myself to look for Stanley's Dwarfs. Told that Tippoo
Tib is somewhere about. Also advised to be very oareful not to fall
in with the "man-eating Manyuema."
Stilt Later.—Did. fall in with them I Also fell out with them.
They made all preparations for using me as a side-dish at a cannibal
banquet, when Tippoo Tib arrived and released me.
Tanganyika again.'—Back here safe and sound I Tippoo Tib
turned out most unsatisfactory. Wanted to marry me!—with a
hundred other wives already I Not prepared for thie sort of home-
life. Managed to get away by describing to him a Remington type-
writer, and promising if he let me go, to bring one baok at once.
Find that my " rear-guard "—the negress and Arabs—have been
up to fearful pranks during my absenoe. Negress killed and ate one
of Arabs, and then other Arab killed and ate negress! Tell remaining
Arab I shall have him punished when I get to Coast. Arab says
he '11 get there first, and publish a book showing me up!

several bales of baggage, and a diary. Question now is—will Femi-
nine Tact show me road to Zanzibar?

THE AMUSING RATTLE'S TOPICAL NOTE-BOOK.
(For the Use of Professional Diners-out and other Amateur Entertainers.)
The Meeting of Parliament.—This is not a very promising
subject, but mild mirth may be produced in outlying districts (say
Southend or Honiton, Devon) by observing, that the rock upon
whioh the Irish Party went to pieces was a happy one—in fact, a
Glad-stone. This, striotly speaking, is not a new jest, and there-
fore must be helped ont by a burst of self-supplied laughter. You
might add, that as Members of Parliament are obliged, by the rules
of the House, to address their colleagues standing, there would be
little chance of a seated discussion. But you must, however, take
care to cough when you say seated, so that those on the look-out for
a brilliant bon-mot may know that you mean heated.
The Revolt in Chili.—The name of the plaoe in which the disturb-
ances have occurred will help you effectively to remark that the
outbreak is seasonable during the present inclement weather. As
the Army sympathises with the Government, and the sister service
with the rioters, you can suggest "that knaves would, of course, be
supported by the Navy!" This may lead up to a really magnificent
burst of waggery in the assertion that the dissentients must of
necessity be all at sea."
The New Archbishop of York.—Insist that his Graoe is a Scotch-
man, and not an Irishman, and prove your proposition by declaring
that the road to buccesswas "Ma co re's (pronounced MAMTJrt) secret I"
This really splendid flash of humour will bear polishing—as written
it seems a little in the rough. You may refer to the Primate's
universally acknowledged partiality for quiet sarcasm, by saying
that " ever since he joined the etclesiastioil Bench he has been known
as an arch Bishop!" These entertaining quibbles, delicately handled,
should he received with enthusiasm at a five o'olock tea in a Deanery.
The New Play at the Hat/market.—As the plot turns upon the
doings of the Society of Friends, you may extract a jest by saying
"that many of the characters trembled with anxiety before its pro-
duction—in faot, were quakers!" The name of the Manager of the
Haymarket has frequently been the subject of a quip, if not a crank;
still it may yet serve as a peg for slyly observing mat, "At the fall
of the Curtain, Thie. naturally enough, appeared with a bough.'"
The Weather.— Of course you must introduce this subject, and
as everything that can be said hat been said about it, you may
quote Stbnby Smith as your authority for observing, that the only
possible sport for M. F. H.'s at this time of the year must be "hunt
—the slipper.'" If the point of this '' good thing " is not immediately
obvious, the fault will be with Sidney Smith, and not with you.
And this quaint oddity should satiate your audience with mirth and
merriment until next week—and even longer 1

STILL ANOTHER CHAPTER OF MY MEMOIR.
{fit Supplement of '' Harper.")
Bi Moksiecr Van de Blowitzown Troup.

forget at this moment where I
was born, but I lived long
enough at Marseilles to be mar-
ried in that great southern
French city. My wife's father
had been in the Marines; her
uncle (on the grandfather's side)
had been a Sapeur pompier.
Thus did I, as it were, become
lie with the sea and land forces
of my adopted country. My
wife's mother was a descendant
of a noble but anonymous family
in the Vosges, whilst her mater-
nal uncle was accustomed to
attach to himself some local
unpopularity by profening for
investigation a complicated sheet
which set forth his genealogy,
tracing his origin baok to the
Bourbons.
You ask me which Bourbon?
1 frankly answer, 1 oannot tell.
My wife'B maternal unole spoke
of them as "t*e Bourbons," just
« as you talk of "the Groceries,"
ana no one asks you Lequelt
As for my own ancestry, I do not speak of it. I have ntver been in the habit
of thrusting myself on the attention of the public It is sufficient for me that
my wife's maternal uncle's ancestors were Bourbons.
I first began to take charge of public affairs in connection with an election
that took place in the city where I found myself. M. de Lessffs opposed
Thiers and Gambitta. He presented himself as an independent candidate.
Wu he f I suspected. Already I had my secret agents in every oentre of
population. One. whose letter bore the post-mark the Pyramids, placed in
my hand proof that De Lesseps was an official candidate of the Empire. I
secretly conveyed this information to a local newspaper. The news burst like
a tempest on the public of Marseilles, and swept away in its irresistible whirl
the candidature of M. de Lesseps.
This was pretty well for a first newspaper paragraph, worth at the time, as I
remember thinking, more than the paltry three sous a line that became my due.
But I had made more than a few sous—I had made an enemy 1 Years after,
Bismarck told me how, chatting with Napoleok the Third at Donohery,
that fallen monarch had recalled this incident, in whioh his prophetic eye
justly disoerned the beginning of the end. He admitted that he had said to
the Km press, "France is too small for me and Van de Blowitzavn Tromp.
One of us must cross la Manche."
Sublime! One of us did.
But my time was not yet. My friends advised, nay, besought me to leave
Marseilles. Towards the end of this year (1869) I took their advice, and retired
to a small property I chanced to nave in the centre of the Landes. This
place being dry, and somewhat remote, was peculiarly suitable for watching
the growth of great problems with a mind unbiassed by any knowledge of
facts. I saw the Franco-German question grow, and I foresaw how it would
end. I wrote to Thiers, and told him all about it. When the war broke out
1 mounted my stilts, and cautiously made my way across the untrodden track,
following my Destiny. I had predicted the downfall of the Empire, and, in
its last gasp, the Empire strove to wither me. Proceedings had been com-
menced, when Sedan put an end to them.
At this epoch France was on her knees, beaten down by the German hand,
her eyes blind with blood and tears. One thing alone could cheer her. I could
do it, and 1 did. I applied for Letters of Naturalisation. Some weeks later I
became a French citizen, and received a letter from M.
Adolfh Cbemieux, then Minister of Justice, and never
suspected of being a wag. He wrote: "Your applica-
tion for Naturalisation in the midst of our great disasters,
is for me the signal of a new life for us. A country
whioh in the midst of such catastrophes recruits citizens
like you, is not to be despaired of."
Years after, Thiers, then President of the Republio,
said, "I never will forget that you became a Frenchman
in the time of our misfortunes." Edmund About pic-
turesquely said, "// s'est fait naturaliser vaincu."
Bismarck has told me that the Emperor William, then
at Versailles, in the first flush of triumph at touch on
his brow of the Imperial diadem, hearing of the event
through the capturing of a balloon despatched with the
news to dolorous Paris, passed a sleepless night.
"I fear me," he said, "all will now be lost."
"Not at all, your Majesty," said Bismarck, affecting
an indifference he assures me be did net feel. "There
is not even a Frenchman the more. They have lost an
Emperor and gained Van de Blowitzown Tromp. C«
met egal."
"Not quite," said the Emperor, with subtle flattery.
The Emperor William, though he had his failings, was
a keen judge of the comparative value of men.
The limits of this article compel me to glance hastily
over succeeding epochs in a career with the main drift
of whioh the civilised world is already familiar. After
saving Marseilles to the Republio, by a series of aotions
alternating between desperate valour and brilliant st rategy,
I went to Paris to report on the great event. Calling
on the official entrusted with the duty of considering
claims to decorations, I began at once by saying that
my own name mu» t not be taken into consideration.
"Let my name," I said, gently but firmly, "be scored
out in the proposed list of decorations."
"Mais, Monsieur," he said, "there is no such list."
I, however, was not to be put off with exouse of that
kind. I insisted, both to the Secretary of the Minister
of War, to M. Thiers, that I should not be decorated. I
was only too successful. When the list oame out, all my
associates at Marseilles were decorated. I was not in-
cluded. This was all right. It was what I had requested.
I could say nothing. All the same, I could not help
thinking that my advice had been too literally accepted.
Every morning, for a week after, I called on M. Thiers.
At the end of the sixth day he said, "You must go to
Riga. I do not quite know where it is, but it sounds
remote. You shall be Consul at Riga." I was delighted.
Like the President, I was not sure where Riga was; but
the salary was certain, and there was tine old Roman
flavour about the title Consul.
But it was not to be. I was predestined to be a great
Newspaper Correspondent. How that came about cannot
be told in this chapter. I will only say that early in my
new career I secured the approbation of Mr. D blank,
who, I need scarcely say, was the most competent judge
the world ever saw of the merits of a journalist.
At the risk of being dry and bald, I have confined
myself to telling accurately what has happened, my
greatest ambition being to leave no one the chance of
misrepresenting, as his whim, fancy, or passion may
dictate, facts in which I am so deeply interested. Let
those note them who, after my time, nave to defend my
memory fhould it ever be attacked.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAPJ.
A GENERAL VIEW OF PRIVATE INQUIRY."
I ax sufficiently old-fashioned, when 1 go to the play, to wish to be amused.
I frankly admit I do not care to he taught a lesson, or to have my mind harrowed
by the presentation of some psychological study. I can remember Wright, and
even Habley, and the days when a
good piece of fun was the last item of
the programme at the Adelphi and the
Olympic-the chief attraction of the
Pittites, who patronised "half-price."
This being so, I am glad to find at the
Strand—a theatre recalling memories
of Jimm t Rooebs and Jon nn y Ci.ark e,
Patty Oliver and Charlotte Satjh-
deks, to say nothing of a lady who was
not only Queen of Comedy but Empress
of Burlesque—"Private Inquiry," a thoroughly
well acted and rattling farce in three Acts. It
is from the Frenoh, but as the task of adaptation
has been entrusted to the Author who turned
BibS the Frisky into Betsy the Wholesome, any
scruples of conscience that the Lobs Chamberlain
may possibly have entertained on reading the original
have been successfully removed, and the play, con-
sequently, is not only highly entertaining, but abso-
lutely free from offence. 1 did not see it until it
had reached its eighth night, and I do not re-
member a piece, taken as a whole, so excellently
acted. Although he does not appear until the Second
Act, Mr. Willie Edoutn, as 'Arry 'Ooker, the
Private Inquiry Agent, is the feature of the per-
formance. His politeness to ladies, his assumption
of businesslike habits, suggested by his reading and
spiking of bogus telegrams brought to him when he
is engaged with a client, his urbanity under difficulties, and his cheerful accept-
ance of the inevitable in whatever shape presented, are all admirable points,
and points that are fully appreciated by the audience. Boars of laughter follow
the one after the other when 'Arry 'Ooker is on the stage. Nothing can be
more absurd than his make-up, his bows, his grimaces, and yet under the
surface there is a vein of pathos that causes one to feel a pang of genuine
regret when the poverty-stricken, light-hearted rogue, who, if he cannot secure
a hundred guineas, is equally ready to accept a "tenner," is marched off to
penal servitude as the Curtain falls. The olerk of this entertaining individual,
Toby, is played by a boy like a boy, by Master Buss. Farther, Mr. Alfred
Maltbt could not be better as the suspicious and bamboozled husband. Richard
Wrackham. Again, even the small part of Alexander, a Waiter, is well played.
Once more —the ladies, without exception, are capital; and as a result of this all-
round excellence, the piece " goes," from a quarter to nine till j ust eleven, with
a verve that must be most satisfactory to all concerned. So I can congratulate
the Author upon a piece full of lines that tell, and the Manager upon a play that
is likely to rival in popularity its predecessor, the phenomenally-successful
Our Fiat. And I can offer these congratulations with a clear conscience, because
I am neither Author of the piece nor Manager of the theatre, but as Mr. Rudyard
Kipling might observe, Quite Another Fellow.

"'Qui vala>' fays he.
LARKS!
Sir,—I am surprised that any of your Correspondents should doubt that birds
eat snow. There is a bull-finch in my aviary, and I tried him. He ate it
ravenously. Strange to say, he has not uttered a sound since! My wife says,
"Probably his pipe is frozen." This is such a good joke, I think you ought to
have it. Yours, Lover of Nature.
Sir,—You may like to have the following story in support of the idea that
animals are aware that snow is frozen water. It was related to me by a rather
rackety nephew, who has lived part of his life in South America, and whose
word can be strictly relied on. He relates that once, when he was travelling
among the Andes, at an elevation of some twenty thousand feet, his mules
became very thirsty, and no water was obtainable. Each animal seized a
ealabath with its teeth, filled it with snow, and trotted off to the crater of an
adjacent volcano; it then waited till the lava melted the snow, which it drank
up, and finally trotted back again. My nephew says he should not have
believed a mule could be eo clever, if he had not seen it.
Yours obediently, Samuel Sobersides.
Sir,—Since writing you that letter about our bull-finch, I have discovered
an even more surprising faot, which I am sure no Naturalist has yet dreamed
of. Not only do birds appreciate snow, but they are very fond of iced beveraget.
A torn-tit, who often drinks water from a saucer which we put on our window-
sill, one day found the water frozen. What did the intelligent creature do P
Why, it rapped on the window-pane with its beak till the window was opened,
then hopped on to the sideboard, and began trying to peck the cork out of a
whiskey bottle! I took the hint, and poured some of the spirit into the saucer;
the bird drank it greedily! My wife's comment on this occurrence is really too
good to be lost, so I send it you. She said, "Evidently the bird was not a tom-
tUvtaller.'" Yours, in convulsions, Lover of Nature [at before).
'J*,' replies I, knowing the languag*."
"Jtamet" and another Old Story.
The international susceptibilities of Sheriff Drurio-
lanus — henceforth to bear the Anglo-French title,
Monsieur le Shirif 'Arris de Paris, or 'Arry de Parry,
—appear to have been considerably hurt by a statement
in the Debate to the effect that the appearance in the
London streets of men dressed as Gendarmes—" en gen-
darmes francais," writes Mossoo Drusiolani—intended
as perambulating advertisements for the Waterloo Pano-
rama, was due to a supreme effort of his managerial
genius. So Sherif Dburiolane wrote at onoe to the
London Correspondent of the Figaro, who bears the sin-
gularly French name of Johnson, denying, in his very
best French, that he, M. le Sherif, had had anything to
do with these walking advertisements, or, indeed, with
the Panorama Company at all, from which he had retired
a year ago. Then he adds, like the preux chevalier he is
known to be, that had he still been on the direction of
the aforesaid Compagnie, he, at all events, would never,
never have committed the enormity of even suggesting,
however vaguely , an idea so calculated to needlessly insult
"let susceptibilitis francaises." (" Hear! hear!" and
"Tret bien 1" from the left.) Then M. le 8herif DRtrRio-
lane, rising to the oooasion, finishes with this magnificent
flourish on the Frenoh horn—" Jit suis nt en France "—
(Isn't it very much " to his credit," we ask with W. S. G.,
that, "In spite of all temptations, To belong to other
nations. He remains an Englishman f" Why, certainly)
—"j'ai vicu parmiles Francais, etje suis d tnoitii enfant
de Paris."
Beautiful! MagnMque! Our Druriolant/s is sur-
passing even the G. 0. M., who has been born, more or
less, everywhere, except in Paris. Should the Republic
be in danger, or should Monarchists or Imperialists get a
chance and want a man for the place, let them wire to
Druriolanus, "d tnoitii enfant de Paris," and the
"Enfant"—" Enfant Arris," not "Enfant Gatti"
—will be ready, aye ready, to assume the purple, and to
bring all his properties with him. "A moitii "—and the
other half? That will ever remain British. So a la

Hagiolooical and Historical Note.—Dr. Harold
Browne, "the retiring Bishop" of Winchester, as he is
called, on account of his innate modesty, wrote to the
people of Farnham to say that, "never was there a
Bishop since the time of his earliest predecessor in the
See, St. Swithin, more literally 'at home' at Farnham
Castle than himself." To this fact Dr. H. B. is, perhaps,
unaware that the Saint in question owed his name, as
when any visitor called to ask if he were at home, the
Hall-porter of the period invariably answered, "Yes,
Saint's within." Dr. Harold Browns is welcome to
this information, which ought to have been in Notes
and Queries.
It is said that the invitations for the Drury Lane oe
bration of Twelfth Night will not be sent out with _.
free a hand next year, the young men on the recent
oooasion having been so Baddeley behaved.

CAPITAL AND LABOUR FORECAST;
Or, Six of One and Ha'f-a-Dozen of the OJter.
Though in some quarters a better feeling was reported to have
prevailed, still, according to latest accounts, the outlook can scarcely
be regarded as satisfactory. A meeting of the Amalgamated En-
gineering Tram-Drivers' Mutual Stand-Shoulder-to-Shoulder Stran-
gulation Society was held on Glasgow Green yesterday afternoon, at
which, amid a good deal of boisterous interruption, several delegates
addressed the assembled audience and recounted their recent ex-
periences up to date. There were still 1700 of the Company's old
hands out of work, and though, thanks to the profound enthusiasm,
"their just cause" had excited amidst the Trade Societies in the
South, by which, owing to subscriptions from no less important bodies
than the Bootmakers' Benevolent Grandmothers' Association, and
Superannuated Undertakers' Orphan Society, they had .been able to
stay out and defy the Company, receiving all the while, every man
of them, a stipend of 3». 9rf. a-week, still they had almost come to
the end of their resources, and all that they had in hand towards
next week's fund for distribution, was £1 13s. 7W., received in
ooppers from the Deputy-Chairman of the Metropolitan Boys' Boot-
blacking Brigade, accompanied with an intimation that that help must
he regarded as the last that can be counted on from that quarter.
Under these circumstances it became a question whether it was not
almost time to consider some terms of compromise.
In the above sense one of the speakers addressed the meeting,
but he was speedily followed by another, who insisted that, "come
what might," they would stick to their latest terms, whioh were, a
three-hours' day— (loud cheers) —and time-and-three-quarters for
any work expected after three o'clock in the afternoon. (Prolonged
cheering.)
A Delegate here rose, and said it was all very well their cheering,
but could they get it? (A Voice, " We'll try.'") For his part, the
speaker continued, he had had enough of trying. With wife and
children starving at home, he had only one course open to him, and
that was, to knock under to the Company and their ten-hours' day,
if they would have him. (Groans, amid which the Speaker had his
hat knocked over his eyes, and was kicked out of the assembly.}
The discussion was then continued, much in the same vein, and
eventually culminated in a free fight, in whioh the Chairman got his
head broken, on declaring that a Motion further limiting the work
nut day to two hours and a half, was lost by a narrow majority.
Yesterday afternoon the Directors' Mutual Anti-Labour Protection
Company met at their Central Offioes for the despatch of their usual
business. The ordinary Report was read, which announced that
though the affairs of three great Railway Companies had "gone"
literally "to the dogs," still, the Directors of each had to be con-
gratulated on showing a firm front, in refusing to acknowledge even
the existence of their employe's. The usual congratulatory Motions
were put, pro forma, and passed, and, amid a general manifestation
of gloomy satisfaction, the meeting was further adjourned.

FROM OUR MUSICAL BOX.
We sent our Musical Box (Cox being unable to accompany him on
the piano or any other instrument, by reason of the severe weather)
to hear Stavenhaoen at St. James's Hall, Thursday last, the 22nd.
Our Musical B. was nearly turned out of the hall, he was in such
ecstasies of delight over a Beethovenly concerto, which "bangs
Banagher," he said, subsequently translating the expression by
explaining, "that is, beats Beethoven." Our M. B. wept over a
cadenza oompoeed by the performer, and was only restored by the
appearance—her first—of Madame Stavenhagen, who gave some-
body's grand scena far better, probably, than that somebody could
have given it himself, set as it was to fine descriptive music by the
clever Stavenhaoen, whioh delighted all hearers, especially those
who were LiazT-eners. "Altogether," writes our Musical Box, "a
very big sucoesf. Music is thirsty work. I am now about to do a
symphony in B. and 8L"

little difficult to choose the right word, but let us say immured—has
he been immured in some cell Y—for it does sound like a " sell" of
another sort—and has he at last effected a sensational escape P No
doubt Charles, our friend, will be able to offer the public a satis-
factory explanation when he re-appears on the Stage whioh suffers
from his absence.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PLAYING OLD GOOSEBERRY AT THE HAYMARZET;
Or, The Dook, the Dancing Girl, and the Little Lame Duck.
"What is to be admired in Enery Hattohoh Jones is not so much
his work but his pluck,—for has he not, in the first place, overcome
the prudery of the Lord Chamberlain's Licensing: Department, and,
in the seoond plaoe, has he not introduced on the boards of the Hay-
market a good old-fashioned Melodrama, brought "up to date," and
disguised in a Comedy wrapper? Walk in, Ladies and Gentlemen,
and see The Dancing Girl, a Comedy-Drama shall we call it, or,
genetically, a Play? wherein the prominent figures are a wicked
Duke,—vice the "wioked Baronet," now shelved, as nothing under the
duoal rank will suit us nowadays, bless you !—a Provincial Puritan
family, an honest bumpkin lover, a devil of a dancing woman who
lives a double-shuffling sort of life, an angel of a lame girl,—who, of
course, can't cut oapers but goes in for coronets,—a sly, unprin-
cipled, and calculating; kind of angel she is too, but an audience
that loves Melodrama is abovo indulging in uncharitable analysis of
motive,—a town swell in the country, a more or less unscrupulous
land-agent, and a genuine, honest heavy father," of the ancient
type, with a good old-fashioned melodramatio father's curse ready
at the right moment, the last relic of a bygone period of the trans-
pontine Melodrama, which will bring tears to the eyes of many an
elderly'playgoer on hearing the old familiar formula, in the old familiar
situation, reproduced on the stage of the modern Haymarket as if
through the medium of a phonophone.
At all events, Drusilla Ives, alias "the Dancing Girl "—though as to
yer at it!" Dismay of Dook and Dancer!! then Curtain on a
most emphatically effective situation.

by vain repetitions of words and actions. To the house where Mi«

where she dances, how she dances, and when she dances, we are left
pretty well in the dark, as she only gives so slight a taste of her
quality that it seemed like a very amateurish imitation of Miss Kate
Vacohan in her best day,—Drusilla Ives is the mistress, neither pure
nor simple, of the Duke of Guisebury,—a title which is evidently
artfully intended by the, at present, "Only Jones" to be a com-
pound of the French " Guise " and the English "Bury,"—who from
his way of going on and playing old gooseberry with his property,
might have been thus styled with advantage: and so henceforth
let us think and speak of him as His Grace or His Disgrace the Dake
of Gooseberry.
This Duke of Gooseberry visits, "quite unbeknown,"—being, for
this occasion only, the Duke of Disguisebury,—his own property,
the Island of St. Endellion, just to see, we suppose, what sort of
people the Quaker family may be from which his mistress, the
Dancing Quakeress (and how funny she used to be at the Music
Halls and at the Gaiety!), has sprang. For some reason or other, the
Danoing Quakeress has gone to stay a few weeks with her family in
the oountry, and while this hypocritical Daughter of Herodias is
with her Quaker belongings at prayers in the Meeting House, the
spirit moveth her to come out, and to come out uncommonly strong,
as, within a yard or so of the building, she laughs and talks
loudly with Gooseberry, and then in a light-hearted way she
treats the Dook to some amateur imitations of Ellen Terry,
finishing up with a reminiscence of Kate Vaushan; all of whioh
al fresco entertainment is given for the benefit of the afore-
said Gooseberry within sound of the sermon and within sight of
the Meeting House windows. Suddenly her rustic Quaker lover,
a kind of Ham Peggotty, lounges out of the Conventicle, which,
as these persons seem to leave and enter just when it suits
them, ought rather to be called a Chapel-of-EaBe,—and, like the
clown that he is, says in effect, "I'm a-looking at yer 1 I've oaught
Two " Regular Dawgs " having a ttte-a-tete.
Dancing Girl is openly living under the protection of Gooseberry, the
Duke's worthy Steward actually brings his virtuous and ingenuous
young daughter! If ever there were a pair of artful, contriving,
scheming humbugs, it is this worthy couple. Because the Duke
saved her from being run over by his own horses, therefore she con-
siders herself at liberty to limp after him, and round him, and about
him, on every possible ocoasion, to say sharp, priggish things to
him, to make love to him, and in the Third Act so craftily to manage
as to Bpot him just as he is about to drink off a phial of poison, whioh
operation, being preceded by a soliloquy of strong theatrical flavour
and considerable length, gives the lame girl a fair ohanoe of hobbling
down the stairs and arresting the thus "spotted Nobleman's" arm
at the critical moment. Curtain, and a really fine dramatic situation.
"Which nobody can deny."
It is in this same Third Act that the fine old crusted melodramatio
curse is uncorked,
and a good impe
rial quart of wrath
is poured out on
his dancing daugh-
ter's head by the
heavy father, who,
country Buit, forces his way
into the gilded halls of the
Duke's mansion, past the
flunkeys, the head butler,
and all the rest of the usual
pampered menials. An au-
dience that can accept this
old-fashioned cheap-novel
kind of olap-trap, and wit-
ness, without surprise, the
marvellous departure of all
the guests, supperless, for
no assigned cause, or expli-
cable reason, not even an
alarm of fire having been
given, will Bwallow a con-
siderable amount.
The Fourth Act is an
anticlimax, and shows up AcT jTj
the faulty construction of _ . , ., _" _
the drama. Of course the Pantaloon David Peggotty Gladstone Ives,
news comes that the Dancing Girl is dead, and this information
is brought by a Sainte Nitouche of a "Sister" of some Theatrical
Order (not admitted after half-past seven), whose very appear-
ance is a suggestio falsi. Equally, of course, a letter is found,
whioh, as exculpating Gooseberry, induces the old cuss of a Puritan
father to shake hands with the converted "Spotted Nobleman ";
but, be it remembered, the Dook is still his landlord, and the
value of the property is going up considerably. Then it appears
that the old humbug of an agent has sagaciously speculated in
the improvement of the island, and poor Gooseberry feels under
suoh an obligation to that sly puss of an agent's daughter, that,
in a melancholy sort of way, he offers her his hand, which she,
the artful little hussy of a Becky Sharp, with considerable affeo-
tation of ooyness, accepts, and down goes the Curtain upon as unsatis-
factory and commonplace a termination to a good Melodrama as any

Philistine of the Philistines could possibly wish. It would have
been a human tragedy indeed had poor Gooseberry poisoned himself,
and the girl whose life he had saved had arrived just too late, only
to die of a broken heart. But that "is quite another story."
The piece is well played all round, especially by the men.
Mr. Tree is excellent, except in the ultra-melodramatic parts,
where he is too noisy. The very best thing he does is the perfeot
finish of the Second Aot, when, without a word, he sits in the
chair before the fire lost in dismal thought. This is admirable:

without exception the best thing in the whole piece. _ Mr. F. Kerr

There is small demand, my Tommy, for a Dibdin in our day.
Oh, I know that arter dinner your M.P.'s can up and quote

Still the Times has took our case up,—werry handsome o' the Times !—
I have heard it charged with prejudice, olass-hate, and similar

But it shows it's got fair sperret and a buzzum as can feel
When it backs us with a "Leader" arter printing our " Appeal."
You are better off, my Tommy, than the Navy Rank and File,
You may chance to get promotion,—arter waiting a good while—
But the tip-top of Tar luck's to be a Warrant Officer;
We ain't like to get no further, if we even get as fur.
'Tain't encouraging, my hearty. As for me, I'm old and grey,
'Tis too late now for promotion if it chanced to come my way;
And my knowledge, and my patter, and my manners—well I guess
They mayn't be peroisely fitted for a dandy ward-room mess.
But the Navy of the Future, Tommy Atkins, is our care,
We hava gone through many changes, and for others must prepare.
It will make the Navy popular, more prospect of advanoe;
And what I say is, Tommy,—let the young uns have a chance!
Some I know will cry " Impossible," and slate the soheme like fun,
Most good things are " impossible," my Tommy,—till they're done!

other officials I can call to mind, winding up by a regular good row
at that of the General in Command. Trumpeter comes out. Take
bugle from him, and give the call. General in Command rubs his
eyes sleepily, and says he '11 be down presently.
5 a.m.—Hurry back to station. Catoh early cattle-train going
back to Berlin. Jump on engine, and deolare myself. Wire
approach down line, and tear away with the cattle, at seventy
miles an hour, getting back to Berlin just in time for breakfast.
Fancy I woke them up! Altogether, a very enjoyable outing.

OUR SPORT AND ART EXHIBITION.

"ON THE SCENT."
FOR BETTER-OR "WORSE.
[At the Anti-Gambling Demonstration recently held in Exeter Hall, Sir
Richard Webstsr, the Attorney-General, said that it was supposed by
many that it was impossible to enjoy athletic pursuits without becoming
interested in a pecuniary sense. He should therefore like to add, not for the
purpose of holding himself up as an example, that, during his entire interest
in sports of all kinds, he had never made a bet.]
An! these are days when Recklessness, bereft of ready cosh,
Will strive to remedy the void by speculative splash;
It is a salutary sight for Bankruptcy and Debt—
Our good Attorney-General who never made a bet.
His interest in manly sports, an interest immense,
Was ne'er degraded to a mere " pecuniary sense;
His boyhood's love of marbles leaves him nothing to regret—
Our good Attorney-General who never made a bet.
Next, when a youth, the cricket-bat he first began to wield,
And "Heads or TailsP" re-echoed for the Innings through the
field.
He sternly scorned to toss the coin, howe'er his friends might fret—
Our good Attorney-General who never made a bet.
And when, an Undergraduate, he swiftly skimmed his mile,
And comrades staked with confidence on him their little pile,
He'd beg them not on his account in gambling ways to get—
This good Attorney-General who never made a bet.
To play for money ruins whist: and seldom can his Club
Persuade him to put counters (coins for Zulus!) on the rub;
He hat been known for lozenges to dabble with piquet;
He wasn't Chief Attorney then, nor was it quite a bet.
His wise profession's ornament, he looks on all such games
Far otherwise than Russell does, than Lockwood, Hall, or James;
For pure platonio love of play he stands unequalled yet—
Our good Attorney-General who never made a bet.
St. Stephen's, too, thinks much of him; but ah! his soul it pains
To know that Speculation o'er the lobby sometimes reigns;
He's chided Old Morality and Randolph and the set,
Beseeching them on bended knees to never make a bet.
We all are fond of him, in short, the Boxes with the Gods;
That he's a first-rate fellow we would gladly lay the odds.
But no!—himself would veto that. "We must not wound our pet
Precise Attorney-General who never made a bet.
THE ARISTOTELIAN TREASURE-TROVE.
All have heard of " a Manuscript found in a Bottle,"
But here is a waif with romanoe yet more fraught:
A newly-found treatise by old Aristotle
Is flotsam indeed from the Ooean of Thought.
Oh, happy discoverer, luoky Museum!
Not this time the foreigner scores off John Bull.
Teuton pundits would lift, for suoh luok, their Te Dtum!
No Shapira, Punch hopes, such a triumph to dull!
May it all turn out right f Further details won't tire us.

EOBERT ON SKATIN'.
"Well, I begins to agree with them as says, and says it too as if
they ment it, that noboddy can reelly tell what is reel grand injiy-
ment till they trys it, and trys it farely, and gives it a good chance.
I remembers how I used to try and like Crikkit, when I was much
yunger than I am now, and stuck to it in spite of several black eyes
when I stood pint, and shouts of, "Now then, Butter-Fingers!"
when I stood leg, till a serten werry fast Bowler sent me away from
the wicket with two black and blew legs, and then I guv it up. I
guv up Foot Ball for simler reesuns, and have never attemted not
nothink in the Hathlettick line ewer since, my sumwat rapid increase
in size and wait a hading me in that wise resolooshun.
_ But sumhow it appened, dooring the hawful whether we has all
bin a shivering threw for this long time, that I found my atenshun
direckted to the strange f ack that, whilst amost ewerybody was busily
engaged in a cussin and swarin at the bitter cold and the dirty
slippery sno, ewerybody else seemed to be injying of theirselves
like wun-a-clock. Now it so appened that when waiting one day
upon the young swell I have before spoken of, at the "Grand 'Otel/'
he was jined by another swell, who told him what a glorias day's
skating he had been avin in Hide Park I and how he ment to go
agen to-morrer, "if the luvly frost wood but continue 1"
So my oureosety was naterally egsited, and nex day off I gos to
Hide Park, and there I seed the xplanation of what had serprised
me so much. For there was hunderds and hunderds of not only
specUbly drest Gents, but also of reel-looking Ladys, a skatin
away like fun, and a larfing away and injying theirselves jest as if
it had bin a nice Summer's day. Presently I append to find myself
a standing jest by a nice respeotabel looking man, with a
nice, cumferai-looking chair, and seweral pares of Skates; and
presently he says to me, quite permisous - like, "They all
seems to be a injying theirselves, don't they, Sir?" which
they most suttenly did; and then he says to me, says he, "Do
you skate, Sir?" to which my natral pride made me reply,
Not much!" "Will you have a pair on. Sir," says he, "jest for
a trial?" "Is there any fear of a axident?" says I. "Oh no, Sir,"
says he, "not if you toilers my hinstrucshuns." So I aoshally sets
myself down in his chair, and lets him put me on a pair of Skates!
The first differculty was, how to get up, which I found as I coudn't
manage at all without his asistanee; for, strange to say, both of my
feet insisted on going quite contrary ways. Howewer, by grarsping
on him quite tite round his waste, I at last manidged to go along
three or lour slides, and then I returned to the chair, and sat down
again: and he was kind enuff to compliment me, and to say that he
thort I was a gitting on fust-rate, and, if I woud only cum ewery
day for about a week or so, he had no dowt but he shood see me a
skating a figger of hate like the best on 'em!
Hencouraged by his truthfool remarks, I at larst wentured to let
go of him and try a few slides by myself, and shood no dowt have
suckseeded hadmerably, but my bootif ul stick to which I was. a
trustin to elp me from falling, elided rite away from me in a most
unnatral manner, and down I came on my onerabel seat, with suoh
a smasher as seemed to shake all my foreteen stun into a cocked-hat,
to speak, hallegorically, and there I lay, elpless and opeless, and
wundring how on airth I shood ever get up again. But my trusty
frend and guide was soon at my Bide, as the Poet says, but all his
united force, with that of too boys who came to his assistance, and
larfed all the wile, as rude boys will, coud not get me on my feet
agen 'till my too skates was taken off, and I agen found myself on
terror fermer on my friend's chair. It took me longer to recover
myself than I shood have thort posserbel, but at larst I was enabled
to crawl away, but not 'till my f rend had supplied me with jest a
nice nip of brandy, which he said he kept andy in ease of any suoh
surprism axidents as had appened to me.
So what with paying for the use of the skates, and the use of the
Brandy, and the use of the too boys, and the use of a handsnm Cab to
take me to the "Grand," that was rayther a deer ten minutes
skating, and as it was reelly and trewly my fust attemt at that
poplar and xoiting passtime, I think I may safely affirm—as I have
alreddy done to my better harf—whose langwidge, when I related
my hadwentur, is scarcely worth repeating, as it was most oertenly
not complementary that it shall be my larst. Robert.

A FREEZING POINT.
{By a Frozen-out Lover.)
Thf.y tell me thou art cold, my
sweet—
A fact that scarcely odd is.
Gales half so cruel never beat
Against poor human bodies.
Cupid's attire is far too light
To weather Thirty Fahrenheit.
How can a glow the soul entrance,
When frostbite nips the finger,
And blushes quit the countenance
To nigh the nostril linger! _
Warmth were a miracle, in sight
And grip of Thirty Fahrenheit.
Chill! chill to me, my Paradise! I
I'11 not complain or curse on.
One cannot well be otherwise
To any mortal person.
Mere icebergs ambulant, we fight
Ferocious Thirty Fahrenheit.
Cold art thou? Not so cold as I—
Nought living could be colder.
I'm far too cold to sob or sigh,
Still less in passion Bmoulder.
I'm turning fast to something
quite
As numb as Thirty Fahrenheit.

ESSENCE OP PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FEOM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Thursday, January 22.—Both Houses met
tc-day after Christmas Recess. No Uueeh's Speech ; no moving and
seconding of Address; no
Royal Commission and pro-
cession of Speaker to Lords.
All seems strange, and
spirits generally a little
depressed. Only Robert
Fowler rises superior to
circumstances of hour.
Blustering about the Lobby
"like Boreas," says Caus-
ton.
"Only not so rude," tays
Harry Lawson, jealous for
the reputation of Metropo-
litan Members, even though
some sit on the Benohes
opposite. With folded hands
thrust behind coat - tails,
rollicking stride, thunderous
voice, and blooming coun-
tenance, Sir Robert posi-
tively pervades the Looby.
Personally receives Pope
Hennes8Y; shakes hands
with everybody; and finally
halting for a moment under
the electric - lit arohway
leading into House, presents
interesting and attractive
picture of the Glorified Al-
King Yah! Yah! derman.
Scotch Members take possession of Commons to-night. Lord
Advocate brings in Bill, providing new machinery for private legis-
lation; the Scotch Members with one accord fall upon proposal, and

tear it to ribbons. Meanwhile other Members troop off to Lords,
where spectacle is provided which beats the pantomimes into fits.
Two new Peers to take their seats; procession formed in back room
outside; enters from below Bar. First comes Black Rod, with
nothing black about bim; then Garter King-at-Arms, a herculean
personage, fully five feet high, with a dangerous gleam in his eye. and
the Royal Arms of England quartered in scarlet and blue and gold on
his manly back. Behind, in red cloaks slashed with ermine, the new
Baron and his escort of two brother Peers. There being no room for
them to advance in due procession, they fall into single file, make
their way to the Woolsack, where sits that pink of chivalry, that
mould of fashion, that perfection of form, the Lord High
Chancellor.
New Peer drops on one knee, presents bundle of paper to Lord
Chancellor. L. C, coyly turning bis head on one side, gingerly
takes roll, hands it to Attendant, New Peer gets up; procession
bundles back to table; here Gentleman in wig and gown gabbles
something from long document. New Peer writes his name in a
book (probably promising subscription towards expenses of perform-
ance.) Garter King-at-Arms getting to the front trots off with
comically short strides for so great a dignity; New Peer and escort
follow, Black Rod solemnly bringing up rear. Garter King makes
for Cross Benches by the door ; passes along one, the rest following,
as if playing game of Follow-my-leader. Garter King suddenly
making off to the right, walks up Gangway to row of empty Benohes.
Stops at the topmost row but one, and passes along. New Peer
wants to follow him. Garter King prods him in chest with small
stick, and tells him to go on to the Bench above. This he does, with
escort. Meanwhile, Black Rod left out in the cold. Garter King
motions to three Peers to be seated; tells them to put on their
cocked-hats; counts ten; nods to them; they rise to feet, uplift
cocked hats in direction of Lord Chancellor on Woolsack. He
raises his in return of salute. Three Peers sit down again. Garter
King counts ten; nods: up they get again, salute Lord Chancellor ,
tit down once more. One—two—three—four—ten," Garter King
mumbles to himself. Once more they rise; salute Lord Chan-
cellor; then Garter King leading the way, they march back to
Woolsack.
Garter King now introduces new Member to Lord Chancellor.
L. C. starts as if he had never seen him before; then extends right

hand; New Peer shakes it, procession reformed, walks out behind Bar. A few
minutes later, another comes in, all the business done over again. Impretsive,
but a little monotonous, and as soon as possible after its conclusion Noble
Lords go home.
Business done.—In Commons, Private Bill Legislation Bill read a Second Time.
Friday.—Wm. O'Brien, standing with tear-stained face on pier at Boulogne
waving wet handkerchief across the main, has drawn away Justin McCarthy,
who can't be back till Monday. Parnell was to have come down to-day. and,
making believe to be still Leader of United
Irishmen, asked Old Morality to set aside
day for discussion of his Motion on operation
of Crimes Act. Breb Fox accordingly looked
in shortly after Speaker took the Chair.
"Seen Brer Rabbit anywhere about,
Toby?" he asked.
So I 'up and told him about McCarthy's
new journey to Boulogne.
"Oh, indeed," said Brer Fox: "if that's
the case. I think I won't trouble House to-
night. Oot an engagement elsewhere; think
I '11 go and keep it. Not used to hanging
about here, as you know; awful bore to me:
but as long as Brer Rabbit comes here, I
must be on spot to vindicate my position.
So I '11 say ta-ta. No—never mind ringing
for fire-escape; can walk down the steps to-
day."
Thus there being no Irish Leader on the
premises, and hardly any Irish Members,
had a rare chance for attending to British
business. Channing brought on question of
working Overtime on the Railways: moved
Resolution invoking interference of Board of
Trade. Question a little awkward for Government. Couldn't afford to offend
Railway Direotors, yet wouldn't do to flout numerous body of working-men,
ohiefly voters. Proposed to shelve business by appointment of Select Committee.
Opposition not going to let them off so easily. Debate kept up all night, wind-
ing up with critical Division; Government majority only 17.
"And this," said Old Morality, with injured look, "after Plunket's
brilliant oration on the time-tables of the London and North-Western Railway
Company! If he'd only illustrated it with magic-lantern, things would have
gone differently. But he was obstinate; said there would be difficulty in
arranging the slides, and so rejected proposal.
Business done.—Channing's Resolution about Overtime on Railways negatived
by 1 11 Votes against 124.

HOMAGE TO SIR JAMES HANNEN.
Sib,—As the recognised organ of the legal profession, will you permit me
to address you? It is common knowledge that within the last few days the
Right Honourable Sir James Hannen has been raised to a dignity greater than
that he has been able to claim for the last eighteen years, when he has sat as
President of the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty Division of the High Court
of Justice. On leaving the Court in which so many of us were known to him,
he was kind enough to say, "Those eighteen years had been eighteen years of
happiness to him, chiefly arising from the advantage he had had in having
before him habitually practising in that Court Barristers who had felt that
their part was just as important as his in the administration of Justice, and
who had assisted him enormously. Without their assistance, his task would
have been an arduous one, whereas it had been, as he had said, an agreeable
one." As I personally have had the honour of appearing before his Lordship
for many years, I think that it is only right that I should make some acknow-
ledgment of this kind recognition of my services.
It is quite true that I have felt, as Sir James Hannen suggests, that my
part (humble as it may have been) has been just as important as his in the
administration of Justice. But it is gratifying to me beyond measure to learn
that my invariable custom of bowing to his Lordship on the commencement
and conclusion of each day's forensic duties—which has been the limit of my
"habitual praotice" in the Probate Division—should "have assisted him enor-
mously." 1 can only say that, thanks to his unvarying kindness and courtesy,
my daily recognition of his greetings from the Bench, instead of being an
arduous task, has ever been an agreeable one. I have the honour to remain, Sir,
your very obedient servant, (Signed) A. Briefless, Juniob.
Bump-Handle Court, January 24, 1891.
"Pbo-digious!"— In last Sunday's Observer we read that at St. Peters-
burg Madame Melba, as Juliette, "teas recalled thirty-one timet be/ore the
proscenium." The italics are ours, rather! If this sort of thing is to be
repeated during the Opera season here, and each gifted singer is recalled in
proportion to his or her merits, the audience will not get away till the following
morning. Juliette must have said, on the above-mentioned occasion, "Parting
is such sweet sorrow, That I could say ' good-night' until to-morrow." And
the usual chorus of operatic habitue's will be, "We won't go home till morning.
Till daylight doth appear!" with refrain, "For—she (or he) 's a jolly good
singer," &c., ad infinitum, or "ad injC-next-nightum."
THE FRIEZE OF THE PARTHENON.
England to Athens:—
0 Queen 0f Cities, with a crown of woe,
Scarred by the ruin of two thousand years,
By fraud and by barbarian force laid low,
Buried in dust, and watered with the tears
Of unregarded bondmen, toiling on.
Crushed in the shadow of their Parthenon;

Mother of heroes, Athens, nought availed
The Macedonian's triumph, or the chain
Of Rome; the conquering Osmanli failed,
His myriad hosts have trampled thee in vain.
They for thy deathless body raised the pyre,
And held the torch, but Heaven forbade the fire.
Then didst thou rise, and, shattering thy bands,
Burst in war's thunder on the Muslim horde,
Who shrank appalled before thee, while thy hands
Wielded again the imperishable sword,
The sword that smote the Persian when he came,
Countless as sand, thy virgin might to tame.
Mother of freemen, Athens, thou art free,
Free as the spirits of thy mighty dead;
And Freedom's northern daughter calls to thee,
"How shall I help thee, sister P Raise thy head,
0 Athens, say what can I give thee now,
1 who am free, to deck thy marble brow?"
• • • • •
Athens replies :—
Shot-dinted, but defiant of decay,
Stand my gaunt columns in a tragio line,
The shattered relics of a glorious day,
Mute guardians of the lost Athena's shrine.
The flame of hope, that faded to despair
Ere Hellas burst her chains, is imaged there.
Yet one there was who came to her for gain.
Ere yet the years of her despair were run;
And with harsh zeal defaced the ruined fane
Full in the blazing light of Hellas' Bun.
Spoiling my home with sacrilegious hand,
He bore his captives to a foreign land.
Ilissus mourns his tutelary god,
Theseus in some far city doth recline:
Lost is the Horse of Night that erstwhile trod
My hall; the god-like shapes that once were mine
Cill to me, "Mother save us ere we die,
Far from thy arms beneath a sunless sky."
How shall I answer? for my arms are fain
To clasp them fast upon the rock-bound steep,
Their ancient home. Shall Athens yearn in vain,
And all in vain must woful Hellas weep?
Must the indignant shade of Phidias mourn
For his dear city, free but how forlorn?
How shall I answer? Nay, I turn to thee,
England, and pray thee, from thy northern throne
Step down and hearken, give them back to me,
0 generous sister, give me back mine own.
Thy jewelled forehead needs no alien gem
Torn from a hapless sister's diadem.

CRUMMLES REDIVIVUS!
Fob some months Society has been on the tip-toe of expectation
with regard to the new Tragedy by Mr. Shaksfeabe Smithson,
which is to inaugurate the magnificent Theatre, built at a sumptuous
and total disregard of expense by Mr. Dii.ky Puff, a lineal des-
cendant of the great Puff family, by
intermarriage with the more recent
Crcmmlfs's, expressly for the perform-
ance of the genuine English Drama. A
veil of secrecy has, however, been drawn
over all the arrangements connected with
the new production. One after another
the Author, the Manager, and the leading
Actors were appealed to in vain. Finally,
one of Our Representatives taking his
oonrage in both hands, brought it and
himself safely to the stage-door of the
new theatre, and knocked. After some
hesitation he was admitted by an intelli-
gent boy, who, however, at first seemed
indisposed to be drawn into conversation,
though he admitted he had been engaged
for the responsible post of call-boy at an
inadequate salary. Oar Representative managed to interest the lad in
the inspection of a numismatic representation of Her Most Graoious
Majesty, which he happened to have brought with him on the baok
of half-a -orown, and with whioh Our Representative toyedJholding
it between the thumb and dexter finger of the right hand. We give
the result in Our Representative's own words:—
"Come this way,'' said the boy, on whom the sight of the coin
seemed to operate like some weird talisman, leading me to a remote
part of the stage, the floor of whioh had been tastefully littered with
orange-peel in a variety of patterns; "we shall be comfortabler."
"Now tell me," I said, '^about this new pieoe."
"It's what they call a Tragedy," said the boy.
"Ah!" I replied, "that is interesting; hut I want to know about
the Author. What do yon think of him?"
"The norther? Oh my!" said the precocious lad. producing an
apple from his trousers' pocket, but his right eye etui fixed on the
talisman, "'e don't count. Why we none of us pays no attention to
'im. Crikey, you should 'a seen 'im come a cropper on his nut down
them new steps. Bat, look 'ere, Sir," he continued, more solemnly,
"I'm a tellin' yer secrets, I am; and if Dilet were to 'ear of it, I'd
get a proper jacketin'. Swear you won't peach."
I gave the requisite pledge. "And that ere arf-orown?" he
said. I nodded assent to what was evidently in his mind. Then
he resumed. "It's a beautiful piece. The play, I mean," he
explained; being fearful lest I should consider him as over-eager
for the ooveted and covenanted reward. "I'm sure 0' that. The
horther says so, and Dilei says so, and Miss O'Gbady says so;
she's got tie 'eroine to play,—and oh, don't she die in the lawtt Act
just proper, with pink light and a couple 0' angels to carry 'er up!
Then there's Mr. Khane 'Arbis, 'e touches 'em all up with 'is
sword, 'places his baok to the wall, and defies the mob,' is what the
hook says. So you may take it from me, it's fust-rate."
I thanked my intelligent little friend for his information, and was
proceeding to put a further question about the music for this new
Drama, whioh. as everyone will soon know, is to be a real chef
d'eeuvre of Sir Hauthob Sunntvun, when a step was heard approaoh-
ing aoross the stage—the deepest, by the way, in London—to where
we were talking.
"That's 'im," said the boy, trembling. *"E's a nqble-'earted
master, so kind and generous, but 'e 'ates deception, and it would be
more than my place is worth to let 'im catch me talking these 'ere
dead secrets to you. Give us the coin. I'm orf!"
And, before I was able to carry out my portion of the contract, he
was gone. And in another moment—so was I,

BRUSTLES' BISHOP.
{By a Muddled Moralist.)
Chapter I.
Ben Brushes was only a poor shoeblack-boy who oleaned boots—
ay, and even shoes, for his daily bread. Saoh time as he could
spare from his avocation he devoted to diligent study of the doctrine
of chance, as exemplified in the practioe of pitoh-and-toss. Often
and often, after pitching and toss-
ing in the cold wet streets for long
weary hours, he would return
home without a halfpenny. Think
of this, ye more fortunate youths,
who sit at home at ease, and play
Loto for nuts! Bnt through all
his vicissitudes, Ben kept a stout
heart, never losing his convio-
tion that something—he knew not
what-^would eventually turn up.
Sometimes it was heads, at others
tails; and in either oase the poor
boy lost money by it — but he

persevered notwithstanding, confident that Fortune would favour
him at last. It is this spirit of undaunted enterprise that has made
our England what it is ]
And one day Fortune did favour him. He observed, as he knelt
before his box, a portly and venerable person close by, who was
engrossed in studying, with apparent complacency, his own reflection
in a plate-glass shop-front. So naive a display of personal vanity,
in one whose dress and demeanour denoted him a Bishop, not
unnaturally excited Benjamin's interest, nor was this lessened when
the stranger, after shaking his head reproachfully at his rtfleoted
image, advanced to the shoe-black's box as if in obedience to a
sudden impulse.
"My lad," he said, with a certain calm dignity, "will you be so
good as to black both my legs for me— at once P"
This unusual request, conceived as it was on a larger scale than
the orders he habitually received, startled the youth, particularly
as he noted th.it the symmetrical and well-turned limb which the
Bishop extended consisted, like its fellow, of a rare and costly
species of mahogany, and shone with the rich and glossy hue of a
newly-fallen horse-chestnut. "I see," commented the Bishop, with
a melancholy smile, "that you have already discovered that my
lower members are the product—not of Nature, but of Art. It was
not always thus with me—but in my younger days I was an ardent
climber—indeed, I am still an Honorary Member of the Hampstead
Heath Alpine Club. Many years since, whilst scaling Primrose
Hill, I was compelled, by a sudden storm, to take refuge in a half-
way hut, where I passed the night, exposed to all the rigours of an
English Midsummer! When I awoke I found, to my surprise, that
both my legs had been bitten by the relentless frost short off im-
mediately below the knee, and I had to continue the ascent next
day in a basket. On descending, I caused these substitutes to be
fashioned, and on them I stumped my way to the exalted position I
now fill, nor have I ever evinced any physioal inconveniences from
my misfortune, save in one particular—that it has rendered
the assumption of gaiters unhappily out of the question! Bnt,
possibly, my wish to have these legs of mine disguised by your pig-
ments, strikes you as bizarre, if not positively eccentrio? Yen will
better understand my reasons after you have heard a confession
which, though necessary, is, believe me, painful to make." And the
good old man, after a short internal struggle, began the following
narrative, which we reserve for a succeeding chapter.
Chapter II.
"Even as a Curate, a certain harmless vanity was ever my besetting
weakness. I might, indeed, have hoped that, after my accident—
but see. my good lad, how pride may lurk, even in our very infirmi-
ties! These artificial limbs have become a yet subtler snare to me
than even those they replaced. I had them constructed, as you see, of
the best mahogany—to match the furniture in my dining-room.
With ever-increasing pleasure, my eyes have gloried in their grain
and gloss, in the symmetry of their curves, in the more than Chinese
delicaoy of their extremities, until gradually they have trampled
upon my better self, they have run away with all my possibilities of
moral usefulness! Yes, but this very moment, as I stood admiring
their contour at yonder window, the pernicious thought crossed my
mind that their appearance would be yet more enhanced if I had
them gilded.'"
"But, your reverent Lordship," objected Brustlbs, as the Bishop
paused, overcome by humiliation, "it's no use coming to me for
that 'ere job!" For, though but a poor boy, he was too honest to
accept any commission under false pretences. Gilding, he knew,
might—and, in a London atmosphere, soon would—become black,
but no boot-polish would ever assume the appearance, even of the
blackest gilt, and so he candidly explained to the Bishop.
"I know, my boy," said the latter, patting Ben's head kindly
with the handle of his umbrella, "I know. Hence my application
to your skill. That presumptuous idea revealed as in a lightning
flash the abyss on the brink of which I stood. This demon of
perverse pride must be laid; humbled for ever. So ply your brushes,
and see you spare not the blacking 1"
Chapter IIT.
Bbustlks obeyed—not without awe, and in a short space of time
two pots of blacking were exhausted, and the roseate glow of the
Bishop's mahogany limbs was for ever hidden under a layer of more
than Nubian ebony!
"'Selp me, your lordly reverence," he cried, dazzled by the
brilliancy of the result; but you might be took, below, for a
Lifeguardsman!"
"Hush," said the Bishop, though with a gratification he could
not restrain, "would you recall the demon I strove to exorcise!
It is true that the change is less of a disfigurement than I feared—
ahem, hoped—but after all, may not the wish to please the eye of
man be excusable? You shall receive a rioh reward. Do you
happen to have such a thing as change for a five-pound note about
you Y"
"Alas!" replied the lad, with ready presence of mind, "but I
have only just paid all my gold into my bank for the day 1"
"No matter," said the Bishop, gently. "I find I have a three-
penny bit, after all. It is yours!" And the good ecolesiastio, as
if to avoid thanks, moved nimbly off, though his eyes still sought
the shop-windows as he passed, with even greater complacency than
before.
Ben tested the threepenny bit between his teeth—it was a spurious
coin; he looked up, but his
late customer was already
passed out of hearing of his
sentiments. He sank down

with his head laid amongst his pots and,brushes. "Bilked!" he
moaned piteously, "bilked—and by a blooming Bishop!"
Chapter IV.
But mark the sequel. The good Bishop had been quite ignorant
that the threepenny bit was a pewter one; quite sincere, for the
time, in his determination to subdue his own weakness. Still it
was not to be: inbred pride is not so easily vanquished—even by
Bishops! The Bishop learned to glory in his blacking far more than
he had ever done in the original mahogany. He had it continually
renewed, and with the most expensive compositions. He would
bend enraptured over the burnished surfaces of his extended legs,
gazing, like another Narcissus, at the features he saw so faithfully
repeated.
Meanwhile the threepence, base as it was, became the humble
instrument of brighter fortunes to Brustles; it showed a marvellous

PLAYTIME FOR A DOLL'S HOUSE.
Dear Mb. Punch,—According to a well-known Critio, writing of a
morning performance of The Bull's Bouse on Tuesday, the 27th ult.,
at Tenry's Theatre, "There is no need to discuss Ibsen's pieoe any
more." I will go a little further, and say, not only should the play
be spared discussion,
but also performance.
All that could be done
for this miserable drama
(if a work utterly devoid
of dramatic interest can
be so entitled) was
effected some years
since, when Breakinq a
Butterfly, a version with
Messrs.
HllXlI
and Jones
as adapters,
was played
at the
P r i n o e's
(now Prince
of Wales's)
Theatre. 1
believe some
one or other
has said that
Fujcy Picture of Hunwellian Admirer of the Ibnenselcs* that version
Drama thoroughly enjoying himself. was mis-
leading, because it modified Ibsen, and did not reveal him in his true
oolours. This I can readily believe, as my recollection of Breaking a
Butterfly merely suggests boredom; whereas, when I consider The
Doll's House of Tuesday, I distinctly mingle with boredom a recol-
lection of something that oaused a feeling of absolute loathing. That
something, I imagine, must be the new matter whioh was absent
from the first version, and crops up in the text of the second, whioh,
according to the Play-bill, appears "in Vol. I. of the authorised edition
of Ibsen's Prose Dramas, edited by William Abcheb, and published
by Mr. Walter Scott." _ By the way, I must confess that, although
the name of the Editor is not familiar to me as a dramatic author,
his superintendence of the authorised text seems to have been per-
formed sufficiently creditably to have rendered him as worthy of an
honourable prefix as the publisher. Why omit the "Mr."? Now I
come to think of it, there is an Englishman, not unconnected with
dramatic literature, who is known nowadays as William, without
the prefix of Mister, but in his own time he was known as Master
William Shakspeabe, and Master he remains. "But this," as Mr.
Rudtabd Kipling might observe, "is quite another William."
I have not the original for reference handy, but the version played
at Terry's Theatre bears internal evidence of a close translation. An
adapter, I fancy, with a free hand would scarcely have made one of the
characters use the same exit speech on two occasions. Nils Krogstad
does this. He can think of nothing better than, "If I am flung into
the gutter, you shall accompany me," repeated twice with the slight
variation, " If I am flung into the gutter for the second time, you shall
accompany me," used for the last exit. Again, Torvald Helmer has
a long monologue in the final Aot that a practised playwright would
have broken up" with the assistance of a portrait, or a letter, or
something. From this it would appear that the Editor, William
Abcheb (without the " Mr.") has very faithfully produced the exact
translation of the original. To be hypercritical, I might suggest that
perhaps occasionally the version is rather too literal. For instance,
Torvald Helmer, although he is cursed with one of the most offensive
wives known to oreation, would scarcely call her " a little lark,"
which conveys the impression that he is a "gay dog," and one given to
the traditional ways of that species of ultra-sociable animals. I have
confessed I have not the original before me, so I cannot Bay whether
the title used by Ibsen is "Smallt Larkz," but I fancy that a
"capering capercailzie," if not actually his words, would be nearer
his meaning. A capercailzie is, according to the dictionaries, a bird
of "a delicious flavour" and partially " green;" it is also found in
Norway " very fine and large," as Ibsen might say. Surely Torvald
would have thus described his semi-verdant Nora, finding her
distinctly to his taste.
Returning to what I venture to imagine must be " new matter" not
in the Herman-pltw-Jonesian version, I consider the scene in whioh
Nora chaffs Dr. Bank about his illness absolutely nauseous, and
the drink-inspired admiration of husband for wife in the concluding
Aot repulsive to the last degree. On Tuesday the spectators received
the piece with patient apathy; and, this being the case, I oould
not help feeling that anyone who could single out suoh a play as
suitable for performance before an English audience, oould scarcely
possess the acumen generally considered a necessary adjunct to the
qualifications of an efficient Dramatic Critic The hero, the heroine,
the doctor, as prigs, oould only appeal to prigs, and thank goodness
the average London theatre-goer is the reverse of a prig. There
was but one redeeming point in the play—its conclusion. It ends
happily in Nora, forger, liar, and—hem—wedded flirt, being sepa-
rated from her innocent children.
For the rest, the pieoe was fairly well acted. But when the Curtain
had fallen for the last time, and the audience were departing more
in sadness than in anger, I could not help asking myself the question,
Had the advantages obtained in witnessing the performance balanced
the expense incurred in securing a Beat? I am foroed to reply in the
negative, as I sign myself regretfully,

A DREAMY MADNESS.
The other night I went to bed,—
It may seem strange, but still I did it,—
And laid to rest my weary head
8o that the bed-olothes nearly hid it;
Which was perhaps the reason why
My brain throughout the night was teeming
With truly wondrous sights, and I
Was wholly given o'er to dreaming.
'Twas on ttc Twenty-first of May,
The streets were filled to overflowing,
The streets, that in a ourious way
Were clean although it kept on snowing.
The daily papers for a change
Came out each day without a leader,'
But. what was surely rather strange,
They didn't lose a single reader I
I saw a Bishop in a tram,
Although he knew it was a Sunday;]
The lion lay down with the lamb,
And Clement Scott with Sidney Grundy.
Professor Huxley said, "In truth
I 'ra really sick to death of rows," and
Wrote there and then to General Booth
To put his name down for a thousand.
I heard that Mr. Parnell wrote
(Much to McCarthy's jubilation)
A very kind and civil note.
In whioh he sent his resignation;
Whilst Andrew Lano with weary air
Professed himself completely staggered
To think how anyone could care
To read a line of Rider Haoqard.
The House of Commons talked about
The case of Mr. Bradlauqh—whether
The Motion which has kept him out
Should now be struck out altogether;
And Old Morality arose
To say they felt no ancient animus,
And when they voted, why of Noes
There wasn't one—they were unanimous .'
• • • • •
I started up, no more to sleep,
The dream somehow had seemed to spoil it,
Nor did it take me long to leap
Out of my bed and make my toilet.
I went down-stairs, and with surprise
I thought of those my dream had slandered,
And there, before my very eyes,
/ saw it printed in the Standard I
I wish I hadn't gone to bed.
I can't imagine why I did it,
Nor why I laid my weary head
So that the clothes completely hid it.
Although I think that must be why
My brain has ever since been teeming;
But tell me (if you can) am I
At present mad, or wot I dreaming P

CHARLIE AND SARAH.
Dear Mr. Punch,—Why should Aristotle bo the only author whose
works get discovered? I found the following story, written on papjrus, and
enclcstd in a copper cylinder, in my back garden, and I am positive that it is
not Aristotlr. Can it possibly have been written by that amiable and in-
structive authoress whose stories for children have recently been reprinted?
Yours, &o., Henry St. Otlb.
Charlie was a"very obedient little boy, and his sister Sarah was a
good, patient little girl. One beautiful summer's day they went to stay
for a week with thtir Uncle William, a man of very high principles,
who was not quite used to the proper method with children. On the even-
ing of their arrival, as they were seated in front of the fire, Charlie
lifted up his bright, obedient, beautiful face, and said, thoughtfully:
"Pray, Uncle William, cannot we have one of those instructive
and amusing conversations such as children love, about refraction,
and relativity, and initial velocity, and Mesopotamia generally't"
"Oh, yes, Uncle William!" said Sarah, pausing to wipe her
patient little nose; " Our dear Papa.is always so pleasant and poly-
syllabic on these subjects."
Then Uncle William regretted that he had paid less attention in his
youth to the shilling science primers, but he pulled himself togetherand
determined to do his best. "Certainly, my dear children, nothing could
please me more. Now here I have a jug and a glass. You will observe
that I pour some water from the jug into the glass. This illustrates
one of the properties of water. Can you tell me what I mean?"
"Fluidity!" said both the children, with enthusiasm.
"Yes, quite so, and—er—er—has a brick fluidity?"
"Why, no, Unole William!"
"Well—st—why hasn't it?" asked Unole William, with some-
thing almost like desperation in his voice.
"That, Unole," said the obedient Charlie, "is one of the things
which we should like to learn from you to-night."
"Yes, we shall come to that; but, in order to make you under-
stand it better, I must carry my experiment a little further. In this
decanter I have what is called whiskey. I pour some of it into the
water. Now it is more usual to put the whiskey in first, and the
water afterwards. Can you tell me why that is so 'i Think it out for
yourselves." And Uncle William smiled genially.
There was silence for a few moments. Then little Sarah said,
timidly: "I think it must be because, when a man wishes to drink,
whiskey is the first thing which naturally ocours to his mind. He
does not think about water until afterwards."
"Quite right. That is the explanation of the scientists. And
why do you think I put in the water first and the whiskey afterwards t"
It was," said Charlie, brightly, "in order that we might not
see so exactly how much whiskey you took."
"No, that's quite wrong. I did it out of sheer originality. Now
what would happen if I drank this ourious mixture?"
"You would be breaking the pledge, Unole William," said both
children, promptly and heartily.
"Wrong again. I should be acting under doctor's orders."
"Why hasn't a brick any fluidity r" asked Sarah, patiently.
"Don t interrupt, my dear child. We're coming to that. Now,
Charlie, when you eat or drink anything, where does it go?"
"It goes into my little oh, no, Uncle, I cannot say that word,"
and Charlie, who was of a singularly modest and refined disposition,
buried his face in his hands, and blushed deeply.
"Admirable!" exclaimed Uncle William. "One cannot be too
refined. Call it the blank. It goes into your blank. Well, whiskey
raises the tone of the blank. Just as, when you screw up the _peg
of a violin, you raise the tone of the string. By drinking this I
raise the tone of my blank." He suited the action to the word.
"Now you'll be screwed," said Charlie, " like the pegs of the"
"On one glass of weak whiskey-and-water—never!
"But why hasn't a brick any fluidity?" asked S
patiently.
"First of all, listen to this. That whiskey-and-water is now
inside me. I want you to understand what intide means. Go and
stand in the passage, and shut the door of this room after you."
"But, Uncle," said 8abah, patiently," why hasn't a brick any"
"Hush, Sarah, hush 1" said the obedient Charlie. "It is our
duty to obey Uncle William in all things."
So the two children went out of the room, and shut the door after
them. Unole William went to the door, and locked it.
"Now then," he said, cheerily, "I am inside. And where
are you?"
"Outside."
"Yes—and outside you'll stop. One of the servants will put you
to bed." And Unole William went baok to the decanter.

A DEAD FROST.
When I saw you on a January morning,
With a very little pair of skates indeed,
And the frosty glow your fairy faoe adorning,
I was suddenly from other passions freed.
And the year at its imperial beginning
Showed the woman who alone was worth the winning;
Though the growing flame awhile I tried to smother
Like a brother;
And that's a very common phase indeed,
As we read.
My hat and stick I suddenly found fleeting,
And they whistled o'er the surface, smooth and black,
And the ice, with an unwonted warmth of greeting,
Slapt me suddenly and hard upon the back.
I didn't mind your laughing, if the laughter
Had left no sting of, scorn to rankle after.
Though I'd joyously have flung myself before you
To adore you,
Still to sit with all one's might upon the ice
Isn't nioe.
When I met you in the lordly local ball-room,
Where you queen'd it, the suburban world's desire,
Though your programme for my name had left but small
I somehow snatched five valses from the fire. [room,
And I did stout supper-service for your mother,
While you wove the self-same spells o'er many another,
And I said, no doubt, the sort of things that they did,
In the shaded
Little nook beneath the palms upon the stair,
To my fair.
But I noticed, as I learned to know you better,
And you ceased to wile the victim at your feet,
There was very little silk about the fetter,
And 'twere flattery to say your sway was sweet:
Nay, you made the light and airy shrine of beauty
A centre for the most exacting duty,
And the fealty of the family undoubting
Met with flouting,
As a tribute which was nothing but your due,
As they knew.
Your Pnpa is getting elderly and bulky,
And he loves you as tbe apple of his eye,
Yet very little things will make you Bulky,
And to meet his little ways you never try.
And I see him look a trifle hurt and puzzled,
And his love for you is often check'd and muzzled;
Yet I think, upon the whole, that I would rather
Be your father,
Than the lover you could torture at your ease,
If you please.

STRANGE, BUT TRUE.
Sib,—Under tbe heading of "Ecclesiastical Intelli-
gence" in the Times of Saturday, I read that. "The
Lord Chancellor has preferred the Rev. W. R. Welch,
of Hull, to the Vicarage of Withernwick, East York-
shire." I presume the Loud Chancellor knows both
the gentleman and the place thoroughly, and so wisely
eleots which he prefers; but to one who, like myself and
thousands of others, know neither, it strikes me that I
would certainly prefer the place to the parson, however
worthy. It is, indeed, gratifying to see that the Highest
Representative of Law and Order in the realm, after
Her Gracious Majesty, is so utterly uninfluenced by
any mercenary motives. I send this by Private Post,
an old soldier, and am yours enthusiastically,
The Retreat, HamcelLon-Sea. Noodle de Noodle.
"Better Late than Never."—Two Jurymen, says a
paragraph in last Saturday's Times, wrote to the Solicitor
acting for a female prisoner, one Cutler, who had been
convicted of perjury and sentenced at Chester, to say
that they " gave in to a verdict of Guilty because it was
very late, and one gentleman had an important business
engagement at home." This recalls the line, "And
wretches hang that Jurymen may dine." The remainder
of Ellen Cutler's sentence of five years' penal servitude
is remitted. It is satisfactory to know that these two
had the courage of their opinions before it was too late.

House of Commons, Monday, Jan. 2(5.—Plunket

Works of recent times. A little coolness sprung up
between bim and Cavendish Bentinck about those
staircases in Westminster Hall. But chacun a son
idea of a staircase. Plunket quite as likely to be
light as C. B. Always doing something to improve
arrangements of House. Does it quietly, too; Mem-
bers know nothing about it till they come down and
find new Smoking-room, fresh arrangements of lights,
new rooms for Ministers, and occasionally a priceless
old table adorning Tea-room. Various ac-
counts of its origin. Some say Magna Charta
signed on it. Others fixing earlier date and
attraoted by the initials n,W. R." clearly
carved on left leg, affirm that it is the very
table on which Wiluak Rex took his five
o'clock tea after Battle of Hastings.
Latest surprise prepared by First Com-
missioner is illumination of entrance to House
from Lobby, cunningly effeoted by eleotrio
lights set within recesses of arch. Schnad-
horst, revisiting House after long interval,
astonished at this. "Making things very
comfortable in anticipation of our coming
in," he says, smiling sweetly.
Later oame upon Nicholas Woods; found
him standing in attitude of patient and in-
telligent expectation. "What are vou wait-
ing there for?" I asked. "Why don't vou
come in and hear Swinburne make one or
"Dear me!" two speeohes on Tithes BiU?"

"Well—er-faot is," said Nicholas, steadfastly keeping his eyes on
arohway, "Wilfbid Lawson told me that if I was here about eleven
o'clock I would see Pltjnkbt and the Attobney-Genebal oome out
under the arohway dancing a pas de deux. Couldn't make out when
I arrived what the illumination was for; asked Law son. 1 Oh,' says
he, 'it's the First Commissioner's reminiscence of one of the alcoves
at Vauxhall Gardens.' Then he told me about Plunkbt and
Webster. Thought I'd like to see it. Do you think it's all right P"
"Well," I said, "Albebt Rollit did tell me something about
Attobney-Genebal going on the Spree. But that was in Germany,
and he had his skates with him. Don't know how it'll be here.
You mustn't forget that Wilfrid's something of a wag. Wouldn't
advise you to wait much after eleven o'clock."
House engaged all night on Tithes Bill. Not particularly lively.
Towards midnight Tanneb, preternaturally quiet since House met,
suddenly woke up, and, d propos de bottes, moved to report progress.
Coubtney down on him like cartload of bricks; declined to put
Motion, declaring it abuse of forms of House. This rather depress-
ing. In good old times there would have been an outburst of
indignation in Irish camp; Chairman's ruling challenged, and
squabble agreeably ocoupied rest of evening. But times changed.
No Irish present to back Tanneb, who, with despairing look round,
subsided, and business went forward without further check.
Business done.—Tithes Bill in Committee.
Tuesday.—"Or. Dice De Lisle oame down to House to-night full
of high'resolve. Hadn't yet been a Member of House when it shook
from time to time with the roar of con-
troversy round Bbadlaugh, his oath,
his affirmation, and his stylographio
Ean. At that time was in Singapore,
elping 8ir Frederick Weld to govern
the Straits Settlements. Buthad watched
controversy closely, and had contri-
buted to its settlement by writing a
luminous treatise, entitled, The Par-
liamentary Oath. Now, by chance,
the question cropped up again. Brad-
laugh had secured first place on to-
night's order for his Motion rewinding
famous Resolution of June, 1880, de-
claring him ineligible to take his seat.
Bra dlauu u ill in bed ; sick unto death,
as it seemed; but Hunter had taken
up task for him, and would move Reso-
lution. Of course the Government
would oppose it; if necessary, De Lisle
would assist them with argument. In
any oase, they should have his vote.
Heard Solicitob-Genebal with keen
satisfaction. He showed not only the
undesirability and impossibility of
acceding to proposition, but denounced
it as ''absolutely childish." Mr. G.
followed; but Mr. G. said the same
■Exit • kind of things eleven years ago, when
he was Leader of triumphant party, and had been defeated again and
again. Of course same fate awaited him now. Government had
spoken through month of Solicitob-Genebal, and there was an
end on't.
Not quite. Staffobd Nobthcote, unaccustomed participant in
debate, presented himself. Stood immediately behind Old Mo-
rality, by way of testifying to bis unaltered loyalty. At same
time he suggested that, after all, would be as well to humour Bbad-
laugh and his friends, and strike out Resolution. Then Old
Morality rose from side of Solicitob-Genebal, and, unmindful of
that eminent Lawyer's irresistible argument and uncompromising
declaration, said, on the whole," perhaps Nobthcote was right,
and so mote it be.
The elect of Mid-Leicestershire gasped for air. Did his ears
deceive him, or was this the end of the famous Bbadlaugh inci-
dents? Old Mobality, in his oheerful way, suggested that, as
they were doing the thing, they had better do it unanimously.
General cheer approved. De Lisle started to his feet. One
voice, at least, should be heard in protest against this shameful sur-
render. Began in half-ohoked voice: evidently struggling against
some strange temptation; talked about the Parnell Commission;
accused House of legalising atheism, and whitewashing treason;
argued at length with Mr. G. on doctrine of excess of juris-
diction. Observed, as he went on, to be waving his hands as if
repelling some object; turned his head on one side as if he would
fain escape apparition; House looked on wonderingly. At length,
with something like sudued sob, De Lisle gave way, and Members
learned what had troubled him. It was dear old Mr. Dick's com-
plaint. Standing up to present his Memorial against tergiversation
of Old Mobality, De Lisle could not help dragging in head of
Chables the Fibst. "As a Royalist," he said, "I should main-

tain that the House of Commons exceeded its jurisdiction when it
ordered King Chables the Fibst to be beheaded, but I never heard
that it was proposed, after the Restoration, to expunge the Resolution
from the books."
Irreverent House went off into roars of laughter, amid which Mr.
Dick, more than ever bewildered, sat down, and presently went out to
ask Miss Betsy Trotwood why they laughed.
Business done.—Resolution of June, 1880, declaring Bbadlaugh
ineligible to Bit, expunged from journals.
Thursday.—As Old Mobality finely say s,\'' The worm persistently
incommoded by inconvenient attentions will finally assume an
aggressive attitude." So it has proved to-night. Sydney Gedge
long been object of contumelious attention. Members jeer at him
when he rises; talk whilst he orates; laugh when he is serious, are
serious when he is facetious. But the wounded worm has turned at
last. Sydney has struck. Gedge has been goaded once too often.
It was Coubtney brought it about.
Been six hours in Chair in Committee on
Tithes Bill; feeling faint and weary, glad
to refresh himself with sparkling conver-
sation of Grand Young Gardner; Gedge
on his feet at moment in favourite ora-
torial attitude; pulverising Amendment
moved by Gbay; thought, as he proceeded,
he heard another voice. Could it be?
Yes; it was Chairman of Committees con-
versing with frivolous elderly young man
whilst he (S. G ) was debating the Tithes
Bill! Should he pass over this last indig-
nity? No; honour of House must be vin-
dicated; lofty standard of debate must be
maintained; the higher the position of
offender the more urgent his duty to strike
a blow. Was standing at the moment
aligned with Chair; paused in argument;
faced about to the right and marched with
solemn steps to the end of Gangway, the
Bench having been desolated by his speech
so far as it had gone.
"Sir," he said, bending angry brows on
Chairman, "I am afraid my speech inter-
rupted your conversation. Therefore I
have moved further away."
That was all, but it was enough. Hf.b-
bebt Gardner slunk away. Coubtnky
hastily turned over pages of the Bill;
hung down his guilty head, and tried to
look as if it were Miljian who had been engaged in conversation.
Now M elm an was asleep.
Business done.—Level flow of Debate on Tithes Bill interrupted by
revolt of Sydney Gedge.
Fridav.—Rather a disappointing evening from Opposition point of
view. In advance, was expected to be brilliant field-night. Irish
Administration to be attacked all along line; neoessity for new
departure demonstrated. Shaw-Lefbvre led off with Resolution
demanding establishment of Courts of Arbitration. Large muster of
Members. Mr. G. in his place; expected to speak; but presently
went off; others fell away, and all the running made from Ministe-
rial Benches. Shaw-Lkfevbe roasted mercilessly. House roared
at Saundebson's description of his going to interview Sultan, and
being shown into stable to make acquaintance of Sultan's horse.
Prince Abthub turned on unhappy man full blast of withering
scorn. Don't know whether Shaw-Lkfevke felt it; some men
rather be kicked than not noticed at all; but Liberals felt they had
been drawn into ridiculous position, and mumured bad words.
"What's the use," they ask, "of winning Hartlepool out of doors,
if things are so managed that we are made ridiculous within?"

PUNCH, OE THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MODERN TYPES.
[By Mr. Punch's Own Type Writer.)
No. XXIII.—THE TOLERATED HUSBAND.
It is customary for the sell-righteous moralists who puff them-
selves into a state of Jingo complacency over the failings of foreign
nations, to declare with considerable unction that the domestic
hearth, which every Frenchman habitually tramples upon, is main-
tained in nnviolated purity in every British household. The rude
shocks which Mr. Justice Butt occasionally administers to the
national conscience are readily forgotten, and the chorus of patriotic
adulation is stimulated by the visits which the British censor finds
it necessary to pay (in mufti) to the courts of wickedness in con-
tinental capitals. It may be that among our unimaginative race
the lack of virtue is not presented in the gaudy trappings that
delight our neighbours. Our wickedness is coarser and less attractive.
It gutters like a oheap candle when contrasted with the steady
brilliancy of the Parisian article. Public opinion, too, holds amongst
us a more formidable lash, and wields it with a sterner and more
frequent severity. But it is impossible to deny that our society,
however strict its professed code may be, can and does produce
examples of those lapses from propriety which the superficial publio
deems to be typically and exclusively continental. Not only are they
Eroduced, but their production and their continuance are tolerated
y a certain class, possibly limited, but certainly influential.
Amongst these examples, both of lapse and
of toleration, the Tolerated Husband holds a
foremost place. Certain conditions are necessary
for his proper production. He must be not only
easy-going, but unprincipled, — unprincipled,
that is, rather in the sense of having no particular
principles of any kind than in that of possessing
and practising notoriously bad ones. He must
have a fine contempt for steady respectability,
and an irresistible inclination to that glittering
style of untrammelled life which is believed by
those who live it to be the true Bohemianism.
He should be weak in character, he may be
pleasant in manner and appearance, and he
must be both poor and extravagant. If to these
qualities be added, first a wife, young, good-
looking, and in most respects similar to her
husband, though of a stronger will, and secondly
a friend, rich, determined, strictly unprincipled,
and thoroughly unscrupulous, the conditions
which produce the Tolerated Husband may.be
said to be complete.
The Tolerated Husband may have been at one time an oflioer in a
good regiment. Having married, he finds that his pay, combined
with a moderate private income, and a generous allowance of in-
debtedness, due to the gratification of expensive tastes, is insufficient
to maintain him in that position of comfort to which he oonceives
himself to be entitled. He therefore abandons the career of arms, and
becomes one of those who attempt spasmodically to redeem com-
mercial professions from the taint of mere commercialism by
becoming commercial themselves. It is certain that the gilded
society which turns up a moderately aristocratic nose at trade and
tradesmen, looks with complete indulgence upon an ex-offioer who
dabbles in wine, or associates himself with a new scheme for the
easy manufacture of working-men's boots. An agency to a Fire and
Life Assurance Society is, of course, above 'reproach, and the Stock
Exohange, an institution which, in the imagination of reckless fools,
provides as large a cover as charity, is positively enviable—a repu-
tation which it owes to the fancied ease with whioh half-a-crown is
converted into one hundred thousand pounds by the mere stroke of
an office pen.
The Tolerated Husband tries all these methods, one after
another, with a painful monotony of failure in each. Yet, some-
how or other, he still keeps up appearances, and manages to live
in a certain style not far removed from luxury. He entertains
bis friends at elaborate dinners, both at home and at expensive
restaurants; he is a frequent visitor at theatres, where he often
pays for the stalls of many others as well as for his own. He
takes a small house in the country, and fills it with guests, to
whom he offers admirable wines, and excellent cigars. His wife is
always beautifully dressed, and glitters with an array of jewels
which make her the envy of many a fsteady leader of fashion.
The world begins to ask, vaguely at first, but with a constantly
increasing persistence, how the thing is done. Respectability and
malice combine to whisper a truthful answer. Starting from the
axiom that the precarious income whioh is produced by a want of
success in many branches of business cannot support luxury or
purchase diamonds, they arrive, per saltum, at the conclusion that
there must be some third party to provide the wife and the hus-
band with means for their existence. His name is soon fixed

upon, and his motives readily inferred. It can be none other than
the husband's rich bachelor friend, the same who accompanies the
pair on all their expeditions, who is a constant guest at their
house, and is known to be both lavish and determined in the
prosecution of any object on which he has set his heart. His
heart, in this instance, is set upon his friend's wife, and the
obstacles in his way do not seem to be very formidable. The case,
indeed, is soon too manifest for any one but a born idiot to feign
ignorance of it. The husband is not a born idiot—he either sees it
plainly, or (it may be, after a struggle) he looks another way, and
resigns himself to the inevitable. For inevitable it is, if he is to
continue in that life of indolence and extravagant comfort which
habit has made a necessity for him. So he submits to the constant
companionship of a third party, and, in order to be truly tolerated
in his own household, becomes tolerant in a manner that is almost
sublime. He allows his friend to help him with large subventions
of money; he lets him cover his wife with costly jewels. He is
content to be supplanted without fuss, provided the supplanter never
decreases the stream of his benevolence; and the supplanter, having
more wealth than he knows what to do with, is quite content to
secure his object on such extremely easy terms. And thus the
Tolerated Husband is created.
It is curious to notice how cheerfully, to all outward appearance,
he accepts what other men would oonsider a disaster. Before the
world he carries his head high with an assumption of genial frank-
ness and easy good temper. "Come and dine with us to-morrow,
my boy," he will say to an old acquaintance,
"there'll only be yourself and a couple of
others besides ourselves. "We '11 go to the play
afterwards." And the acquaintance will most
certainly discover, if he accepts the invitation,
that the "ourselves" included not only husband
and wife, but friend as well. He will also
notice that the last is even more at home in
the house, and speaks in a tone of greater
authority than the apparent host. Everything
is referred to him for decision, and the master
of the house treats him with a deferential hu-
mility whioh goes far to contradict the cynical
observation that there is no gratitude on earth.
The Tolerated Husband, indeed, never tires of
dispensing hospitality at the cost of his friend,
and though the whole world knows the case,
there will never be a laok of guests to accept
what is offered.
At last, however, in spite of his toleration, he
beoomes an encumbrance in his own house,
and, like most encumbrances, he has to be
paid off, the friend providing the requisite annual income. One
after another he puts off the last remaining rags of his pretended
self-respeot. He haunts his Clubs less and less frequently, and
seems to wither under the open dislike of those who are repe lied by
the mean and sordid details of his despicable story. And thus he
drags on his life, a degraded and comparatively impoverished outcast,
untidy, haggard and shunned, having forfeited by the restriction of
his spending powers even the good-natured contempt of those who
were not too proud to be at one time mistaken for his friends.

TOMMY ATKINS'S HARD LOT.
"Tommy Atkins," writing modestly
enough to the Daily Chronicle of the 6th,
February, complains that the coal supplied
by the Authorities for barrack-rooms, is so
limited in quantity that " during the winter
this, as a rule, only lasts about two days"
in the week, and Tommy and his comrades
have to "olub-up" to supply the deficiency
out of their own microscopical pay. "In
fact" (says T. A.) "I have been in barrack-
rooms where the men have had no fires after
the first two days of the week." If this be
so, Mr. Punch agrees with Tommy in saying,
"Surely this ought not to bel" Tommy

THEIR "IBSEN-DIXIT."
A new get of Faddists has been gradually growing up, not in
our midst, bat in the parts about Literature and the Drama. The
object of their colt is, one Renbik Ibsen, a Norwegian Dramatist,
(perhaps it would be more correct to say, the Norwegian Dramatist,)
of whose plays a pretty sprinkling of scribes, amateur and pro-
fessional, but all of the very highest culture, profess themselves the
uncompromisingly enthusiastic admirers. You may not know the
Ibsenites or any of their works, but in their company at least,—
that is, supposing yourself so highly privileged as to be admitted
within the innermost circle of the Inner Ibsen Brotherhood,—not
to know Ihsen would be proof positive of your being in the outer
darkness of ignorance, ana in need, however unworthy, of the grace
of Ibsenitish enlightenment. Recruits are wanted in the Ibsenite
ranks, so as to strengthen numerically the one party against the
other; for the Ibsenitish seot has so far progressed as to be at log-
gerheads amongst themselves; not indeed on any really essential
question, such as would be, for example, any doubt as to the position
of Ibsen as a Dramatist, or as to the order of merit and precedence
to be assigned to his works. No, on such matters they are appa-
rently at one; but in other matters they are at one another. Thus
the unity appears to be only superficial, a decent plaster hiding the
rift occasioned by one of their number having Ibterally translated
into English Ibsen's latest Norwegian drama, of whioh translation the
verbal correctness is impugned by another learned Ibsenite.
Not being "a hardy Norseman," and having neither a reading nor
speaking acquaintance with the Norse language, 1 am unable to
decide abstruse points on whioh such learned doctors disagree; but
not being altogether without some practical experience of English
and French drama, I venture to call in question not only the dramatic
ability of the dramatist himself, but also, after perhaps allowing him
some merit as a type-writer or charaoter-sketcher, to assert that the
style and matter of most of his work is always tiresome, frequently
childish, and the subject often morbid and unhealthy; and, farther,
that his method is tedious to the last degree of boredom; for, as a
writer, if I may judge him fairly by his translators, he is didactic
and prosy, and never more tedious than when his dialogue is intended
to be at its very crispest. As a playwright his construction is faulty.
Here and there he gives expression to pretty ideas, reminding me
(still judging by the translation) of Tom Robertson, not when the
latter was in his happiest vein, but when laboriously striving to
make his puppets talk in a sweetly ingenuous manner.
I have never seen any play of Ibsen's on the stage, but I have
read several of them—indeed, as I believe, all that nave hitherto
been translated and published in this country. I was prepared to
be charmed, expecting much. I was soon disillusioned, and great
was my disappointment. Then I re-read them, to judge of them
not merely as dramas for the closet, but as dramas for the stage,
written to be acted, not to be read; or, at all events, as far as the
general public were concerned, to be acted first, and to be read
afterwards. As acting dramas, it is difficult to conceive anything
less practically dramatic. I do not know what the pecuniary result
of his theatrical productions may be in his own country—where, I
believe, he doesn t reside—but, out of his own country (say, here in
London), I should say that a one-night's performance, with a house
half full, would exhaust Ibsen's English public, and quite exhaust
the patience of those who know not Ibsen.
Years ago we had the Chatterton - Bouoicault dictum that
"Shaksprare spelt failure." Now, for Shaksprare read " Ibsen,"
and insert the words "swift and utter" before "failure," and you
have my opinion as to how the formula would stand with regard to
Ibsen. I should be sorry to see any professional Manager making
himself pecuniarily responsible for the success of such an under-
taking, a word which, in its funereal sense, is of ill omen to the
attempt. Let the Ibsenites club together, lease a theatre, and see
how the publio likes their show. There 's nothing doing at the
Royalty just now; let them pay rent in advance, and. become Miss
Kate Santlet's tenants; then, if the Ibsen-worshippers, with their
Arch-priest, or AscHEB-priest, at their head, come to a temporary
understanding with the Gosse-Ibsenites, they could craftily contrive
to be invited as guests to a dinner at the Play wreckers' Club. The
dilettanti members of this association the United Ibsenites could flatter
by deferring to the opinions of their hosts, while inculcating their own,
thus securing the goodwill and patronage of the Playwreckers, a plan
nowadays adopted with considerable success by some of our wiliest
dramatists, eager to secure a free course and be glorified; and so, by
making each one of these mighty amateurs feel that the success
of Ibsen in this country depended on him personally, that is, on his
verdict or ' Ibsen dixit," a run of, say, perhaps three nights might
possibly be secured, when they could play to fairly-filled houses. One
niohtwi' Ibsen," one night only, would, I venture to say, be quite
enough for most of us. "Oh, that mine enemy would write a book!"
"Oh; that my enemy would bring out an Ibsenite play," and try to
ran it I Perhaps he will. In whioh case I will either alter my
opinion or give him a dose of Anti-Fad.

SULLIVANHOE!
Bra viarnuo. Sir Arthur Sullivan of Ivanhoe, or to oompress it
telegraphically by wire, "Braviisimo Sullivanhos."' Loud cries of
"Arthur I Arthur! and as Arthur and Composer he bows a solo
gracefully in front of the Curtain. Then Mr. Julian Sturgis is
handed out to him, when "Sullivan" and
"Julian "—latter name phonetically suggestive
of ancient musical associations,: though who
nowadays remembers "Mons. Julltrn"?—the
composer and librettist, bow' a duet together.
"Musio" and "Words"
disappear behind gorgeous
new draperies. "All's
swell that ends swell," and
nothing

on the first

to our tale.
As to the
dramatic
construc-
tion of this
Opera, had

about it until the situation where that slyboots Rebecca artfully
threatens to chuck herself off from the topmost turret rather than
throw herself away on the bad Templar Sir Brian de Bote- Ouilbert-
s/ms-Sullivan. The Opera might be fairly described as " Scenes from
Ivanhoe" musically illustrated. There is, however, a continuity in
the music which is lacking in the plot.
The Ecenio effects are throughout admirable, and the method,
adopted at the end of each tableau, of leaving the audience still
more in the dark than they were before as to what is going on on
the stage, is an excellent notion, well calculated to intensify the
mystery in which the entire plot is enveloped.
The change of scene—of course highly recommended by the leech
in attendance on the suffering Ivanhoe—from the little seoond-noor-
baok in the top storey of the oastle tower, where the stout Knight
of Ivanhoe is in durance, is managed with the least possible incon-
venience to the invalid, who, whether suffering from gout or pains
in his side,—and, judging by his action, he seemed to feel it, what-
ever it was, all over him,—found himself and his second-hand
lodging-house sofa (quite good enough for a prisoner) suddenly
deposited at the comparatively safe distance of some three hundred
yards or so from the burning Castle of Torquilstone, in which iden-
tical building he himself, not a minute before, had been immured.
So marvellous a flight of fancy is only to be found in an Arabian,
not a Christian, Night's Entertainment.
The Tournament Scene is a very elfeotive "set," but practioally
an elaborate "sell," as all the fighting on horseback is done
"without." Presently, after a fierce clashing of property-swords,
sounding suspiciously like fire-irons, Ivanhoe and Sir Brian come in,
afoot, to fight out " round the sixth, and last." There is refreshing
novelty in Mr. Copland's impersonation of Isaac of York, who
might be taken for Shylock's younger brother who has been experi-
menting on his beard with some curious kind of hair-dye. This
comio little Itaac will no doubt grow older during the run of the piece,
but on the first night he neither looked nor behaved like Rebecca's
aged and venerable sire, nor did Miss Maclntyre—who, by the way, is
charming as Rebecca, and who is so nimble in skipping about the
stage when avoiding the melodramatic Sir Brian de Bois-Ouilbert-
sam-Sullivan, and so generally active and artful as to be quite a
Becky Sharp,—nor, I say, did Miss Macintyre seem to treat her
precocious parent (Isaac must have married very young, seeing that
Betky is full twenty-one, and Itaac apparently very little more

than twenty-eight, or, say, thirty) with any great tenderness and
affection; but these feelings no doubt will be intensified, as she
becomes more and more accustomed to
her jewvenile father during the run of
the Opera, and he may say to her, as the

Bottle Imp did to his
victim, ''Hal Ha!
You must learn to love

Stout Knight laya low.
I have not time to enumerate all the charming effects of the Opera,
but I must not forget the magic property-harp, with, apparently,
limp whip-cord strings, "the harp that once,"or several times, was
played by those accomplished musicians, King Richard, and Friar
Tuck, the latter of whom has by far the most taking song in the
Opera, and which would have received a treble [or a baritone]
encore, had Barkis—meaning Sir Arthur—"been willin'." The
contest between Richard and the Friar is decidedly "Dioky." Nor
must I forget the magnificent property supper in the first scene, at
so much a head, where not a ham or a chicken is touched; nor must
"the waits " between Bome of the sets be forgotten,—"waits" being
so suggestive of musio at the merriest time of the year. Nor, above
all, must I omit to mention the principal character, Ivanhoe himself,
played by Mr. Ben Da vies, who would be quite an ideal Ivanhoe if
he were not such a very real Ivanhoe—only, of course, we must not
forget that he "doubles " the part. There is no thinness about "Ben
Mio," whether considered as a man, or as a good all-round tenor.
I did not envy Ivanhoe't marvellous power of sleep while Miss
Macinttre was singing her best, her sweetest, and her
loudest. For my part I prefer to believe that the crafty
Saxon was " only purtendin'," and was no more asleep
than Joth Sedley on the eve of Waterloo, or the Fat
Boy when he surprised
Mr. Tupman and Aunt
Rachel m the arbour, or
when he pinched Mr.
Pickwick's leg in order
to attract his attention.
But, after all, Ivanhoe
and Roicena, as Thac-
keray remarked, are a
poor namby-pamby pair,
and the real heroine is
Rebecca. The Opera ends
with a " Rebecca Riot."
Every one wishes success
to the new venture.
As to the Musio,—wall,
I am not a musician, and
in any new Opera when
there is no one tuneful
phrase as in A'ida or
Tannhauser, which, at
the very first hearing,
anyone with half an ear
can straightway catch,
and reproduce next day

hand, besides being certain that Friar Tuck's jovial song will" catch

You are, let us say, a young professional man in chambers or
ollioes, incompetently guarded by an idiot boy whom you dare not
trust with the responsibility of denying you to strangers. You hear
a knock at your outer door, followed by conversation in the olerk's
room, after which your salaried idiot announces, "A Gentleman to
see you." Enter a dingy and dismal little man in threadbare black,
who advances with an air of mysterious importance. "1 think," he
begins, "1 'ave the pleasure of speaking to Mr. "(whatever your
name is.) "I take the liberty of calling, Mr. , to consult you on a
matter of the utmost importance, and I shall feel personally obliged if
you will take precautions for our conversation not being over'eard."
He looks grubby for a client—but appearances are deceptive, and
you offer him a seat, assuring him that he may speak with perfect
security—whereupon he proceeds in a lowered voice.

smoothing a slimy tall hat, " is of a nature so

this, you give him up at a postible client, but
a mixture of diffidence and curiotity compete

likewise me to mention—enough to 'int that he occupies a prominent
position amongst the hupper circles of Society, and is frequently to be
met with in the papers. His faithlessness preyed on my Sister's
mind to that degree, that she is now in the Asylum, a nopeless
maniac! My honely Brother was withdrawn from 'Arrow, and now

former play fellers. 'Tantee nannymice salestibus hirte,' indeed, Sir!
"But you ask what befell myself." (You have not—for the simple
reason that, even if you desired information, he has given you no
chance, as yet, of putting in a word.) "Ah, Sir, there you 'ave me

upon a scholarly illusion. But I'ave resolved to conceal nothing—

and I was once more thrown on my own resources.
"In conclusion. Sir, you 'ave doubtless done me the hinjustice to

view was to ask you for pecuniary assistance f' (Here you reflect
with remorse that a suspicion to this effect has certainly crossed your
mind). "Nothing of the sort or kind, I do assure you. A little
sympathy, the relief of pouring out my sorrers upon a feeling

you will probably assure him that you have no intention of outraging
his feelings in any such manner.) "No, and why, Sir? Because you
'ave a gentlemanly'art, and if you were to make seoh a orfer, you
would do it in a kindly Christian spirit which would rob it of all
offence. There's not many as I would bring myself to accept a'paltry

Here he leaves you with every indication of disgust and disap-
pointment, and you will probably hear him indulging in unclassioal
vituperation on the landing.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The Baron is delighted with Montagu Williams's third volume
of Reminiscences, published by Macmillan & Co. His cheery after-
dinner conversational style of telling capital stories is excellent. He
is not writing a
book, he is talking
to us ; he is telling
us a series of good
things, and, quoth
the Baron, let me
advise you to light
your oigar and sit
down in your arm
chair before the
fire, as not only do
you not wish to
interrupt him,
even with a query,
but you feel in-
clined to say, as
the children do
when, seated
round you in the wintry twilight, they have been listening to a story
which has deeply interested them—" Go on, please, tell us another!
The following interpolated "aside," most characteristic of Montagu
Williams's life-like conversational manner of telling a story, occurs
at page 8, where giving an account of a robbery, of which he himself
was the victim, and telling how a thief asked to be shown up to his, the
narrator's room, he says, "The porter, like a fool, gave his consent."
The interpolated "like a fool," carries the jury, tells the whole
story, and wins admiration for the sufferer, who is the real hero of
the tale. But beyond the book's merit as an interesting and amusing
companion, it contains some valuable practical suggestions for
relieving the ordinary distress in the poorest districts which ought to
receive attention in the highest quarters.
To some readers interested in theatrical life, Polly Mountempte
must prove an interesting work of fiction, if a story can be so styled
which, as its author assures his readers with his latest breath, 1
should say in his last paragraph (p. 291), "is a true tale." It is the
story of a "ballet lady" who rises in "the profession" to the
dignity of a speaking part, and is on the point of being raised still
higher in the social scale, and becoming the wife of a real live young
nobleman, when she sensibly accepts a considerable sum of money,
consents to forego her action for breach of promise, and finally
marries a highly respectable acrobat, and becomes the landlady of
the "Man of Kent." The earlier portion is entertaining, especially
to those who are not altogether ignorant of some of the personages,
sketohes of whom are drawn by the author, Mr. Charles Hollis,
with, it is not improbable, considerable fidelity. They are rough
sketohes, not by any means highly finished, but then suoh was the
character of the original models. Before, however, it can be accepted
by the general public as giving an unexaggerated picture of a certain
sort of stage-life, it ought to nave the imprimatur or the nihil obstat
of some generally acknowledged head of the profession; for "the
profession" is Hydra-like in this respect—a republican creation,
with many heads. The Baron de Book-Worms.

THE OYSTERS AT WHITSTABLE FROZEN IN THEIR BEDS!
(See Daily Papers.)
THE OLD WOMAN AND HER "WATER SUPPLY.
(An Old Nursery Rhyme with a 7iew burden.)
There was an old Woman, as I 'to heard say,
The frost froze her water-pipes fast one day;
The frost froze her water-pipes fast at first,
Till a thaw came at last, and the water-pipes burst.
By came the Company, greedy of gain,
And it out her water all off at the main,
It out her water off sharp, if yon please.
Though it wasn't her fault that the pipes began to freeze.
It wasn't her fault that the water-pipes burst.
So she had no water for oleansing or thirst,
She had no water, and she began to ory,
"Oh, what a cruel buzzum has a Water Company'
But I '11 repair the pipes, since so it must be,
And the plumber, I'm aware, will make piekings out
of me.
If there's a frost I've no water for my pail,
And if there's a thaw then the rate-collectors rail."
On Law the old Woman is entirely in the dark;
There seems ;no one to save her from the fresh-water
shark;
The shark does what he likes, and she can only ory,
"Who'll help a poor old Woman 'gainst the Water
Company?"
HOI-MEM.
"Moi-Meme," in the course of his pleasant Worldly
wanderings among things in general, observes, d propoi
of the younger Coquklir's suggestion absut lectures by
professors of the Dramatio Art to youthful students,
One can scarcely fancy a more humorous sight than Mr.
Toole giving a professional lecture to dramatio aspirants,
telling them when to wink, when to wheezo, when to
''souse his glove,'" &o. Now it so happens that when
this same idea was first started—or perhaps revived—
some eleven years ago, Professor Toolb's Lecture to
Students of the Dramatio Art was given in Mr. Punch's
pages. The lecture, one of a series supposed to be given
by various actors, will be found in Vol. LXXV1IL,
page 93. It appeared en the 28th of February, 1880.

THE HIGHEST EDUCATION;
Or, what is looming a-head,
A Deputation on behalf of the Exasperated Ratepayers' Associa-
tion waited yesterday afternoon on the Chairman of the London
School Board at their new and commodious palatial premises erected
on the vast central site recently cleared, regardless of expense, for
that purpose in Piccadilly, and presented a further protest against
the ever-increasing expenditure indulged in by that body. The
Chairman, smilingly intimating that he would hear what the Depu-
tation had to say, though he added, amidst the ill-suppressed merri-
ment of his confreres, he supposed it was the old sing-song protest,
possibly on this occasion because they had recently directed that the
boys attending the schools of the Board should come in "Eton"
suits, the cost of which naturally fell upon the rates, or some
captious objection of that kind, which it really was a waste of
breath to discuss. However, whatever it was, he added, he was
willing to hear it.
The Spokesman of the Deputation, a D ake in red need circumstances,
who ascribed his ruin to the heavy rates he had been'called upon to
pay through the extravaganoe of the Board, and who declined to give
nis name, said that though they had not thought the Eton suits a
necessity, still it was not against them that they had to protest. It
was the addition of Astronomy involving the erection (with fitting
first-class instruments) of 341 observatories in the London district
alone, Chinese, taught by 500 native Professors imported from Pekin
for the purpose, horse-riding, yachting, and the church organ (these
last two being compulsory), together with the use of the tricycle,
type-writer/and phonograph, all of which instruments were provided
for every single pupil at the expense of the ratepayers, to the curri-
culum of all those pupils who were fitted for the third standard. The
speaker said he knew that it had long been settled that the finest and
education that our advanced civilisation could
supply should be provided for the submerged half of the population,
and they could not grumble at these things, but what they did not
consider necessary was. that a salary should be forthcoming for
each pupil-teacher sufficient to enable him or her to drive down
to the schools in their own carriage and pair. (Much laughter.)
He did not think it a laughing matter. He would strongly suggest
a diminution of at least £1000 a-year in the salaries of these over-
paid officials.
The Chairman here asked the speaker if he had considered that
"descending" from a carriage was necessarily connected with the
teaching of Deportment, on which the Board set great value? Was
he not aware that some great man had said, wishing to give Deport-
ment its proper weight as an educational factor, that the Battle of
Waterloo (at least he thought he was quoting correctly) was won at
Almaoks? (Renewed laughter.) Anyhow, he did not consider that
£2,500 a-year, and a house in May fair, was at all an excessive remu-
neration for a School-Board teacher, as measured by the Board's
standard. He thought, if that was all the Deputation had to urge,
that they might have saved themselves the trouble their protest had
cost them.
The Spokesman having for a few moments consulted with his
colleagues, hereupon turned to the Chairman, and delivering with
fearful emphasis the customary enrse on the School Board, its
Chairman, and all its belongings, at the same time thanking the
Chairman for his courteous reception of the Deputation, silently
and sulkily withdrew.
Druriolanus and Dancino.—The Fanoy Dress Ball—not a " Ball
Marsky"—at Covent Garden, last Tuesday week, was a great
success, on which Dhubiolands Fobtunatus is hereby congratu-
lated. There is to be a similar festivity, to celebrate Mi- Care me.
Quite appropriate this date, when the season is half Lent, and the
costumes almost all borrowed.

TO ME. EUDYAED KIPLING.
f" Every minute of my time during 1891 ii already mortgaged.
In 1892 yon may count upon me."—Mr. Kipling to Magazine
Editor, who wished to secure him at a Contributor.] ,
Oh, happy man I for whom this world of ours
Is but a oeaseleas round of milk and honey,
Who use your wondrous word-compelling powers
For us in telling tales (and making money),
How yon must laugh to rake the dollars in,
The publishers—how badly you must bleed them;
Your tales are good, but yet, ere you begin
On more, just think of us who've got to read them.
It frightens us to hear your Ninety-One
Is mortgaged—for the prospect's not inviting,
To think of all that may and will be done,
If, through the present year you ne'er oease writing!
With bated breath we ask, and humble mien—
We realise how far we come behind you—
That you will leave one remnant Magazine
In whioh we may be sure we shall not find you.
Then will your Rudyabd name with joy be hailed,
If,
And yours will be a never-fading glory,
you're asked to write a Liqht that Failed,
You merely tell us, "That's another story."
AN UPPEE NOTE.
Sib,—I mustn't interfere with the diary of Toby, M.P.
But, as he is not reported as being in the Upper House on
this particular occasion, I cannot help drawing general
attention to the dispatoh of business among the Lords on
Thursday last. I quote from the Parliamentary Report
in the Daily Telegraph, whioh informed us that
"The Lord Chancellor took hie seat on the Woolsack at a
quarter-past four o'clock."
Then in came "A New Spiritual Peer." Awful! It
sounds like an apparition in a blood-curdling ghost-
story. Where was Lisa Joko with his pencil? Well,
"the new Spiritual Peer took his oath and his seat"—
why wasn't he called upon for his toast and sentiment P—
and then—what happened? Did their Lordships stay to
hare a friendly chat with the new-oomer? No, not a
bit of it; for the report says,
"Their Lordships rose at twenty-fire minutes to fire o'clock."
So that, in effect, as soon as the new boy came in, and
seated himself, all the old boys went out. There's
manners for you! And this in the Upper House, too! 1
Yours truly, The Makqdiz.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extracted from the Diary of Toby, M.P.
Souse of Commons, Monday Night, Feb. 2.
—"I do not," said Old Morality, a cloud of
disappointment settling on his massive brow,
"know any case where, comparatively late in
life, after a blameless career, depravity has
so suddenly broken out in a man as it has with
Sydney Gf.dge. It is true, that upon occa-
sion Oedqe has not given entire satisfaction
to our friends opposite. They hold the opinion
that his incursions in debate have been inop-
portune, and, in short, unnecessary; but that
is their affair. We have had no ground for
complaint. Gedoe has always voted straight,
has appropriately filled up a dull half-hour
when we had to Keep a Debate going, and at
all times he has invested our side of the House
with a certain je ne sais quoi of dignity, com-
bined with profound wisdom. And
now to go and break out in this un-
expected manner I It is incomprehen-
sible,—would be, if I had not seen him
with myown organs of vision, incre-
dible. We must make Oedqb a Peer,
or a County Court Judge."
Old Morality's discomposure not The Eollit Albert that gathered
unwarranted. Gedge certainly made Three Bills into the Statute
our flesh creep to-night. Of all things Book.

in the world, it came; about on the Tither Bill. In Committee all
night; Sir John Swinburne spoken several times; Habcourt,
leading Opposition, made several efforts to inspire proceedings with
a little life, but not to be done. Bill rapidly slipping through;
Amendments to Clauses all disposed of; a few new ones on paper.
Of course not slightest ohance of being added to Bill. One by one
moved; Minister objected; Clause negatived; and there an end of
it. Twelve o'clock olose at hand; on stroke of Midnight, Debate
must be adjourned; still plenty of time to get the Bill through Com-
mittee. Everything out of the way except new Clause in name of
Sydney Gedge. But Gedgb loyal Ministerialist; not likely he
would interfere with arrangements, and endanger progress of Bill.
Hicks-Bkach, in charge of measure, kept his eye on the dock;
three minutes to Twelve; running it pretty close, hut just time to
get Bill through. Gedoe on his feet; quite unnecessary; needn't
stand up to (ay he would not move his Clause; if he had simply
lifted his hat when Chairman called his name it would be under-
stood that he had sacrificed his Clause. Dangerous this, dallying
on stroke of Midnight.
To his horror, Hicks-Beach heard Gedoe beginning to describe
purport of his new Clause. Was going to move it thenP Yes.
After moment's horrified pause, Ministerialists broke into angry cries
of, "Divide 1" Opposition convulsed with laughter; Hicks-Beach
pale and stem, and stony silent; Sydney Gedoe flushed, conversa-
tional, dogged. Even if Tithes Bill were lost he would explain the
bearing of his new Clause. Scene increasing in hilarity; lasted
three minutes; then Midnight sounded, and Sydney sat down,
surprised to find he had talked out the Tithes Bill.
You might have knooked me down with a feather," said Albert
Eollit, who, before opening his lips, had observed the precaution
of propping himself up against the wall. "Gedoe, of all men, to

Standing Fire.
spoil the Ministerial plan, and imperil their arrangements for the
week! It's allCourtney's fault. Since Gedge tasted Courtney's
blood, on the night he interrupted his speech by chatting in the
Chair with Hkbbkbt Gahdner, Gedge has never been the same
man. There's no knowing to what lengths he may not go."
Business done.—Sydney Gedge broken ont again worse than ever.
Tuesday.—Mabjoribanks rather depressed as he rose to move his
Resolution for appointment of Royal Commission on New Magazine
Rifle. Had hoped to appear under very
different circumstances. Meant quite to
put in the shade Lyon Play fair's historic
lecture on Margarine, when he had the
tables oovered with pots of that substance,
with penny loaves and small knives for
Members to sample withal. For weeks
Ma k.iorj hanks been preparing for occasion.
Had possessed himself of quite an armoury
of rifles: intended to bring them into the
House and illustrate his lecture with prac-
tical experiments. The climax was to be
the shooting-off scene. Bobby Spencer
and Anstruther on in this. Bobby stand-
ing at the Bar with an apple held on palm
of extended right hand; Mabjoribanks,
using Martini-Henry Rifle, was to clear
the apple off, leaving Bobby's hair un-
singed, and not a wrinkle added to his
collar. Anstruther was next to stand in
the same place, braving the fire of the
Magazine Rifle. But he didn't have an
apple, as it was arranged that the new arm
should jam.
"Suppose it doesn't?" Anstruther in-
quired, when Mabjoribakks first unfolded
his scheme.
"Oh, that'll be all right," said;MAR-
joribanks, cheerily.
Long practice en the Terrace made the
arrangements perfect, when they were
suddenly upset by interference from un-
expected quarter. The Speaker, wondering what all this rifle-
popping was, came to hear of the project; at once said it wouldn't
do; no arms of any kind admitted in House of Commons, except the
sword worn by Serqeant-at-Arms, and onoe a year the lethal
weapons carried by the Naval or Military gentlemen who move and
second Address. Bobby 8pencer rather glad, I fancy; Anstruther
not inconsolable. But Mabjoribanks distinctly depressed.
"Not often I occupy time of House," he said. "We Whips make
Houses, and you empty them. Duff—and he's not a Whip now—
made all the running with his orations on the herring brand.
Thought I would make a hit this time."
"I was a little afraid of it too," said Anstruther.
"Oh, you were all right," said Marjoribanks; "the New
Magazine Rifle will not fire unless, after first shot, you clean it out
with an oily rag, and I was going tol take precious good care to
forget the rag. You've no
public spirit, Anstruther,
since you left us to help
Wolmbb to whip up Dissen-
tients."
No appeal from Speaker's
ruling. Marjoribanks had to
make the best of botched busi-
ness. Brought to the table a
spring snap-extractor, a bolt-
head screw, and some other
odds and ends ; poor substitute
for what he had intended. Still
made out admirable case, Go-
vernment mustering majority
of only 34 against Motion.
Just before Midnight, Tithes
Bill reached; Gbdgb's Amend-
ment still blocked the way;
Chairman called aloud, " Mr.
Gedge I" no answer; plaoe
empty. Whilst Members whis-
pering inquiry, Bill passed
through Committee, and Minis-
ters triumphed. That's all
very well, but where's Gedge?
Cobb, who is developing quite
unsuspected gifts in the Ama-
teur-detective line, intends to
take this matter up when he has settled the affair of the Coroner at
the Bedford inquest.

Grandolph's Latest Achievement.
Business done.—Tithe Bill through Committee. Mysterious
appearance of Sydney Gedge.
Thursday Night.—Grandolph back again, bringing his sheaves
—I mean his beard—with him. Hardly knew him at first. No such
beard been seen in House since Macfarlaitb left us. Not quite the
same colour; but Grandolph could give a handful to Macfarlank,
and win.
"Yes," he said, when I complimented him on so magnificent a
result achieved in comparatively short time, "when I do a thing, I
like to do it well. Little awkward at first, you know, specially on
a windy day; tendency to get between your knees, or wrap itself
round your neck. But we're growing used to eaoh other, and shall
get on nicely by-and-by."
More of Tithes Bill. Drearier than ever, now Gedge'b
empty. Business done.—Report Stage of Tithes BUL
Friday,—Conversation as to course of publio business. Old
Morality regrets Tithes [Bill not through Reporting stage yet.
Down on the paper for to-night, but didn't think there would be
muoh ohance of reaching it. So put it down for Monday. If not
got through then, must be taken on Thursday, and John Mor-
ley'8 Resolution on Crimes Aot shunted along indefinitely. Much
regretted this; duty to Queen and Country, &o.; but no one had
yet discovered the secret of inclosing a quart of fluid matter in a
glass receptacle not exceeding the capacity of one pint.
Members thus informed that Tithes Bill was taken off agenda
for to-night, went off; House emptied; and when, at quarter-past
Seven, Con j he are rose to discuss Mining Royalties, was Counted Out.
"Why, bless me I" oried Old Morality, aghast at the news,
"here 's a sitting praotioally wasted, and we might have used it
for the Tithes Bill. Business done.—Motion to abolish Livery
Franchise negatived by 148 votes against 120.

Chapter I.
The ioeherg was moving. There was bo doubt of it. Moving
with a terrible sinuous motion. Occasionally an incautious ironclad
approached like a foolish hen, and peeked at the moving mass.
Then there was a slight crash, followed by a mild convulsion of
masts, and spars, and iron-plates, and
100-ton guns, then two or three gurgles
and all was still. The iceberg passed
on smiling in triumph, and British
Admirals wrote to the Times to declare
that they had known from the first
that H.M.S. Thunderbomb had been
so faultily constructed, as to make a
contest with a hen-coop a certainty
for the hen-coop. sWtfKEFOlP
And still the iceberg was moving.
"Within its central chamber sat a
■venerable man, lightly clad in nankeen
breeches, a cap of liberty, and a
Liberty silk shirt. He was writing
cabalistically. He did not know why,
nor did he know what "cabalistically"
meant. This was his punishment.
Why was he to be punished P Those
who read shall hear. The walls of
the chamber were fitted with tubes,
and electric wires, and knobs and but-
tons. A bright fire burned on the
hearth. The thick Brussels carpet
was littered with pot-boilers, all fiz-
zing, and sputtering, and steaming,
like so many young Curates at a
Fenny Reading. Suddenly the Philo-
sopher looked up. He spoke to himself.
"Everything is ready," he said, and
pressed a button by bis side. There was a sound as of a Continent
expectorating, a distant nose seemed to twang, the door opened, and
a tall lantern-jawed gentleman, wearing a goat-beard and an
expression of dauntless cunning, stepped into the room.
I guess you were waiting round for me," said Colonel Zedexiah
D. Gobano (for it was indeed he), and sat down in an empty arm-
chnir, as if nothing had happened.
The Philosopher appeared not to notioe. "Next character,
please," he said, pulling out a long stop, and placing his square leg
on the wicket which gave admission to his laboratory, while he
waited for the entrance of the Third Man. There came a murmur
like the buzz of a ton of blasting powder, in a state of excitement.
A oboir of angels seemed to whisper Beefsteak and Pale Ale," as Lord
John Bullpup dashed, without a trace of emotion, into the room, and
sneezed three times without stopping to wipe his boots on the mat.
"One more," said the Philosopher. He hurled himself, feet first,
at the ceiling, knocked his head against the floor, and called down
the tube. J'v suis.'" came the answer, and the typical, light*
hearted Frenchman, M. le Docteur Rfvjsbm, with his thousand
thunders, and his blue lower chest, tripped jauntily up to the other
three. "And now," remarked the Philosopher, "we have got the
lot complete. The story can start. Hurry up! Hark forrard!
En avant!" „ TT
Chapter II.
"Lend me your ears," said the Philosopher. They lent them, but
without interest. Yet they were all keen business men. "Attention,
my friends!" he continued, somewhat annoyed. "You know why
I have summoned you. We have to make another journey together.
The moon, the sea, the earth—we have voyaged and journeyed to
them, and they are exhausted. It remains to visit the Sun, and to
perform the journey in an iceberg. Do you see? Colonel Gobang
will supply the craft, Lord John Bullpup the stupid courage, and you.
M. le Docteur," he added, admiringly, "will of course take the cake."
It came prompt,
The rest

He paused, and waited for Lord John's reply,
and in the expected words.
"Is it a plum-pudding oakeP" said Lord John.
laughed heartily. They loved their jokes, small and old.
Are we agreed P"
"We are."
"Have you anything to askP"
"Nothing. When do we start?"
"We are on our way."
"Shall we not melt as we approaoh P"
"Certainly not"
"How so P"
"We shall have a constant frost."
"Are you sure P"
"Certain. I have taken in a supply of Mutinies, and a stock of
Five-aot Tragedies."
"Good. But how to raise the wind P"
Scarcely had the question been asked, when a frightful explosion
shook the iceberg to its foundations. The Doctor rushed to the gas-
bag. It was empty. He frowned. Lord John was smoking his
pipe; the Colonel was turning over the pages of an old Algebra. He
muttered to himself, "That ought to figure it out. If x ■ the
amount of non-compressible fluid consumed by a given labourer in
y days, fiod, by the substitution of
Eoaohed eggs for kippered herrings,
ow many tea-cups it will take to
make a transpontine hurricane. Yes,"
he went on, that's it. Yes, Sirree."
And at these words the vast mass of
congealed water rose majestically out
of the ocean, and floated off into the
nebular hypothesis. But the Philoso-
pher had vanished.
Chapter III.
When the explosion narrated in the
last chapter took place, the Philosopher
had been looking out of the window.
The shook had nurled him with the
speed of a pirate 'bus through the
air. Soon he became a speck. Shortly
afterwards he reached a point in his
flight situated exactly 40 000 miles
over a London publisher's office. There
was a short contest. Centrifugal and
oentripetal fought for the mastery, and
the latter was victorious. The publisher
was at home. The novel was aooepted,
and the Philosopher started to rejoin
his oomrades lost in the boundless
traots of space.
Chapter IV.
"My faith," said Lord John, "I
am getting tired of this. Shall we never reach the Sun P"
"Courage, my friend," was the well-known reply of the brave
little Doctor. We deviated from our course one hair's-breadth on
the twelfth day. This is the fortieth day, and by the formula for
the precession of the equinoxes, fquared by the parallelogram of an
ellipsoidal bath-bun fresh from the glass cylinder of a refreshment
bar, we find that we are now travelling in a perpetual circle at a
distance of one billion marine gasmeters from the Sun. I have now
accounted for the milk in the cocoa-nut."
"But not," said the Philosopher, as he popped up through a con-
cealed trap-door, "for the hair outside. That remains for another
volume." With that, he rang a gong. The iceberg splintered into
a thousand pieces. The voyagers were each hurled violently down
into their respective countries, where a savage publio was waiting
to devour them.
TOLSTOI ON TOBACCO.
[Count Tolstoi has been declaiming against Tobacco in The Contemporary
Rtricie, and this in no way exaggerates his views.]
Tolstoi fuming, in a pet,
Raves against the cigarette;
Says it's bad at any time.
Leads to every kind of crime;
And the man who smokes, quothhe,
Is as wicked as can be.
Tolstoi knew a man who said
He cut off a woman's head;
But, when half the deed was done.
Lo, the murderer's courage gone!
And he finished, 'tis no joke,
Only by the aid of smoke.
Tolstoi asks us, when do boys
First essay Nicotian joys P
And he answers, quite aghast,
When their innocence is past.
Gamblers smoke, and then again
Smoking pleases the insane.
Tolstoi, when he writes this stuff,
Swears he's serious enough;
Lately Marriage earned his sneers;
At Tobacco now he jeers;
Proving that, without the weed,
Some folks may be mad indeed.

QUEER QUERIES.
Domfstic Service.—My General Servant
has just left me suddenly, on the ridiculous
excuse that she was being "killed by over-
work." She was not required to rise before
5 a.m., and she was generally in bed by
twelve. Our house is not large, though
rather lofty, and there are only fifteen in
family. Of course I shall not pay her any
wages, and shall retain her boxes; but how
can I really punish her for her shameful
desertion ?—Considerate.
Hair Falling Off.—My hair is coming
off. not slowly, but in one great circular
patch at the top of the head. A malicious
report has in consequence been spread abroad
in the neighbourhood that I have been scalped.'
What course ought I to adopt to (1) recover
damages against my traduoers, and (2j recover
my hair ?—Little Wool.

HOW IT'S DONE.
[A Handbook to Honesty.)
No. VIII.-"SOLD AGAIN!"
Scehe—An Auction-room, breathing an air of solid, if somewhat
Philistinish suburban comfort and respectability. Amidst a
labyrinthine accumulation of household furniture, a number
of people are dispersed, many of them substantial-looking
middle-clais male and female "buyers," with lists and lead-
pencils, on the look-out for "bargains," a sprinkling of the
ancient race, and an outer fringe of casual, lounging, lookers-
on. The gentleman in the rostrum is a voluble personage, with a
rapidly roving eye, of preternatural quickness in picking up
"bids." Attendants, shaggy men, in soiled shirt-sleeves, with saw-
dustv whiskers, and husky voices. A pleasant-faced Pater-
familias, and his "Good lady," are discovered inspecting a
solidly-built, well-seasoned, age-toned chest of mahogany drawers.
Paterfamilias [sotto voce). Just what you want, my dear, as far as
I oau see. "What do you think?
Materfamilias. I like the look of them much, Johw. None of
your new, cheap, thinly-veneered, blown-together rubbish, smelling

of shavings and French-polish. Solid ma'ogany, every bit; the
drawers run as smoothly as could be wished, and—see 1 if there ain't
aotually some sprigs of dry lavender still a laying in 'em!
Paterfamilias (decidedly). Just so, my dear. I shall certainly bid
for them. [Marks his catalogue vigorously.

no reserve, and the luoky publio gets the pull. The next article,
Ladies and Gents, No. 471, is a very superior, well-made,
fully-seasoned, solid Spanish ma'ogany chest of drawers. Chest
o' drawers, 8am! (To Paterfamilias.) Would you mind standing a
inoh or so aside. Sir P Thanks! There they are, Ladies and Gentle-
men, open to hinBpection, and warranted to bear it. An unusually
excellent lot, fit for the sleeping-apartment of a prince, at a price
within the means of a pork-butcher. (Laughter.) Oh, it's
righteous. Gents. No 'umbug about me. There's quality, if you
like. Well worth a ten-pun note. What shall I have the pleasure
of saying for this very superior article? 'Ow much for the chest

Thank you, Sir 1 Any advance on thirty shillings? Thirty-live!

[Paterfamilias, highly pleased, pays deposit, and arranges to
send for his bargain in the morning. As hs and his good
lady" leave, they notice close by, three men with barrows,
each bearing a blazingly red and strongly-smelling chest of
drawers. Materfamilias complacently remarks on the mani-
fest superiority of the article they have purchased, to " that
red rubbish." Next morning they receive, instead of their
own "bargain," one of those identical brand-new. badly-
made, unseasoned, thinly-veneered "shop 'uns," which are
'1 blown together by the gross for such purposes. They
protest, but vainly, notwithstanding their true assertion that
the drawers they received contain fresh shavings" instead
of the "sprigs of blooming lavender" they had observed in
those they thought they had purchased. Paterfamilias, a
week later, looking in at the Auction-room, sees what he
could swear to be the very chest of drawers he had pur-
chased being 11 sold again" in a similar fashion.

Finally, you strike a match that never struck you, that never
offended you in any way. Is that juat, or even manly P Yet, in
nine oases out of ten, the law takes no notice of the offence.
"To get a light, or because others do it," Are you not convinced
now that, when you use these words, you are not speaking the
truth?
m.
I no not think I ever met anybody who was quite as moral, or
quite as original, as I am. Tou should give a complete set of my
works to each of your children. I might have generalised on the ill-
effects of those vices from a special oase—my own case. Had I done
so, I could have got it printed. I can get anything printed that I
write. I preferred to take a newer line, and to show you how vile
you are when you use matohes. Everything is vile. But you are
wondering, perhaps, how a great novelist beoomes a small faddist.
You must wait till next month, and then read my article on the im-
morality of parting one's hair with a comb. A common table-fork is
the only pure thing with whioh one can part one's hair. Combs
deaden the conscience. But more of this anon.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THE ETHICS OF MATCH-BOXES.
By Count Dollstoi.
[Intended for a Contemporary, hit found to be too short.)
I.
What is the true explanation of the use whioh people make of
matches—of safety matches, wooden matches, wax matches, and,
less commonly, of fusees? Ask any man why he uses suoh things,
and he will tell you that he does it to get a light, or because others do it.
Is this true P You will probably think so. Let us examine the
question. Why does a man hold his hand in front of a match when
ne lights it in the street f To soreen it from the wind, or to hide it
from the tight of passers-by t Why do ladies leave the dinner-table
before the men begin to smoke? To avoid the smell of tobaooo—
whioh is well known to be aromatic, healthy, and delightful—or
because the natural modesty of women shrinks from witnessing the
striking of a match t Wny, in a railway-carriage, do you hold
your fusee out of window when you light it? Is it because you
do not care about being half-choked—a paltry plea—or is it to
conceal from young persons who may be in the oarriage the sparkle
which must inevitably remind them of wioked and alluring eyes?
"To get a light, or because others do it." Is that true P Do not
trifle with the question. Read all my works. Do not get them
from a oontemptible circulating library, but buy them.
n.
Some may not yet be convinced that the striking of matches is
suggestive and immoral. To me nearly everything is suggestive,
but there are some stupid persons in England. I will be patient
with them, and give them more evidence.
A wax match is called a vesta. Who was Vesta P But this is
too horrible. I cannot pursue this point in a periodical whioh is
read in families. I can only refer you to the olassioal dictionary,
and remind you that everything muBt infallibly suggest its opposite.
Again, there are matches which strike only on the box. It distresses
me to write these words. The idea of "onlyness," of restriction,
must bring matrimony to the mind of everyone. If you do not
know what I think about marriage, buy The Kreutzer Sonata. It
is not customary to have more than one wife. Consequently, any-
thing whioh has one in it—as, for instance, the date of William the
Conqueror—reminds me of marriage, and is, therefore, degrading,
y, the very word "match" suggests marriage; and yet we
young children to sell whole boxes of them in the streets.
What is this the Baron reads in the D. T. of Feb. 9, and in the
Daily Graphic of the same date P Here is a portion of the extraot
from the D. T.:—"The Monthly Meeting of that quaint Literary
Society, 'Ye Odd Volumes,' at Limmer's Hotel, brought together
not merely a goodly show of the Volumes themselves, but an
unusually large array of visitors," and then follows the distinguished
list, the crowning point being reached when we come to the name
of The Baron de Boos-Worms of Punch," and in the_ Daily
Graphic the daring reporter goes a step farther, as, after giving the
name of a certain honoured guest, he parenthetically explains that
this aoademical convive is the "Baron de B.-W.!" Erreur! I, the
Baron de B.-W., being of sound mind and body, herebydeolare that
the Baron himself was not present. And why P Well, do my
readers remember the honest milk-maid's retort to the coxcomb who
said he wouldn't marry her? Good. Then, substituting "me" for
"you," and "he "for "she," the Baron can adopt the maiden's
reply. After this, other reasons would be superfluous.
How oame the reporter to fall into so great an error? Who mis
informed himP A worthy henchman, as indignant as was
Sam WeUer when he found his beloved master's name trifled with,
writes to ask me, " Ain't nobody to be whopped for takin' this here
liberty, Sir?" With the immortal Mr. Pickwick, the Baron
replies, "Certainly not. Not on any account." And, whatever that
sturdy henohman may murmur to himself, he at once obeys. 1' Bring
me my books!" cries the Baron, "I am off to the review."
The Baron's Deputy writes, that he has again been steeping himself
in poetry, and reports as follows:—Ionica (George Allen) is a little
volume, which no admirer of true poetTy should fail to possess. The
author now calls himself W. Cory, but he was known by a different
name to many generations of Etonians. His Muse generally wears
a classical robe, but her speech is always delightfully musical.
She has beautiful cadences, that haunt _ the memory like some
old Volkslied. In spite of a careless confusion between thou" and
"you," I defy anybody to read "Heraclitus," to take only one
instance, without a sense of pleasure whioh will compel him to learn
the two verses by heart. But the Muse is pathetio, playful, and
patriotic, too, when the occasion fits, and, whatever she sings, she
Bings with genuine taste and feeling. Would that we might hope
for more other pure music. So far the Deputy.
Was that eccentric oharaoter in David Copperfield namele
who was represented as sitting in some sort of Blop-shop, wheezing
out fiercely, "0 my lights and liver 1 0 goroo, goroo 1" I think
Dickens didn't give him a name, good or bad; but his constant
repetition of the above outlandish exclamations has impressed
upon him an awful and terriiio personality, whioh places him
among the more popular creations of Dickensian genius. Of what is
this d propost you will ask the Baron. "Well," he will make
reply, it is d propos of cookery books, and bookery cooks; the
latter being those who are not above teaohing themselves from the
saored books of Cookery, and who can put in practice the lessons they
learn therein. Now," quoth the Baron,'' let me recommend you to ask
at Chapman and Hall's for Hilda's ' Where Is It' of Recipes, a
work got up as simply and substantially as a good dinner Bhould be,
with ' pages in waiting,' quite blank, all ready for your notes,—the
book, like a dining-table, being appropriately interleaved; and there
is, happy thought, a pen oil in the cover-side most handy for the
intending Luoullus." The season of Lent is an excellent one for
cookery-books, because you can be studying for the dinner-giving
season, and then—do not forget the generally excellent advice of
your friend, The Baron de Book-Worms.

KING JOHN AT OXFORD.
The Oxford University Dramatic Society have acted another
Shakspearian play with conspicuous success. To say that the
O. U. D. 8. have acted a play of Shaesprare is to say nothing,
seeing that they are compelled, under fear of the most dreadful
punishments known to the University Calendar, to oonfine their
Eistrionio efforts to the drama as Shaespeabe wrote it, with an
occasional exoursion into the dramatio verse of Browning. A great
many, however, of the most influential members of the Hebdomadal
Council are said to view any suoh departure from Shaespeare with
alarm, as calculated to impair the discipline and sap the morality of
the tender nurselings confided to their charge, and it is doubtful if
the experiment will be repeated. Long live the legitimate drama,
say I, and so say all of us. But, after all, it may be questioned
whether those who can listen unharmed to the broad, and, if I may
say so, " illegitimate " humour of Faulconbridge in King John would
take much damage from Sheridan, or Lttton, or Tost Taylor, or
even—though I make this particular suggestion with bated breath—
from the performance of such burlesques as the A. D. C. at Cam-
bridge from time to time offers to its patrons.
All this is, however, by the way. We must take the 0. U. D. S.
as we find it, and 1 must oonfess I found it in a very strong and
flourishing condition during the performance of King John. The
audience is not an easy one to act to. Not that it errs on the side of
over-criticism. Rather it is too painfully f riendly and familiar with
the actors. Here is a stray example culled from the Stalls:—
Enter King Philip, the Dauphin, and attendant Knightt.
Undergraduate in the Stalls [to his Neighbour). Halloa 1 There's
old Johnnie in chain armour and a helmet. Did you ever see suoh a
rum 'un? Let's make him laugh.
[ They do, and the unfortunate Knight infects his fellow Knights
at a moment xchtn a specially stern demeanour is required.
Or again, as here:—
The Dauphin places his arm round the waist of the Lady Blanch,
and conducts her to the back of the stage.
Voice in the Dress Circle. Look out for the Prootor!
[General laughter.
But in spite of these and similar exuberances, the play went well
from first to last, and the enthusiasm of the audience was unbounded.
It was stated on the programme that Mr. Henry Irving had lent
the chain-mail and the tapestries. I have come to the conclusion
that he lent himself as well, and then went and pretended he was
his own son. At any rate, while Mr. Henry Irving (stated to be
of New College) was declaiming as King John, I could have sworn
that the impersonator of Shylock and Macbeth was walking the
CANDOUR IN COURT.
[In Savell v. the Duke of Westminster, Lord
Esher, Master of the Rolls, said:—"It wa< the
demands for interrogatories and discovery of docu-
ments and commissions in cases of this simple
nature which had made the practice of the Common
Law so expensive, and caused the public to fly
from Courts of Law as from a pestilence. This
oppression must be put down."]
"How does it hap," quoth Esheb, M.R ,
"That Solicitors languish for lack of bread?
That want of cases, as felt by the Bar,
To cases of want has recently led?
Oh, how does it come, and why, and whenoe,
That men Bhun the Law as a pestilenoe?
"It can't be denied that the publio tries
To avoid an action by every means j
To a Court it with muoh reluotance hies,
And to arbitration madly leans.
In fact—I say it without offence—
It shuns the Law as a pestilenoe.
"'Tis all the fault," said this great Law Lord,
"Of demands for inspection, and similar
pleas;
Of expenses that neither side can afford,
Commissions and interrogator-ees;
Till Pelion's piled on Ossa—and hence
Men shun the Law as a pestilence.
"/ call it oppression, and I'm a Judge!
We must put it down, for the wrong's acute;
And then the publio no fees will grudge,
But will rush to get suited with a suit;
For Law, the perfection of common sense,
Should never be shunned as a pestilence!"
stage. Voice, gesture, and even mannerisms were there, toned
down, of course, to suit the aoademic atmosphere, but manifest to all
who know and love the great original. My hearty congratulations
to the actor, whoever he was, on a most carefully studied and
dignified rendering of his difficult part. Mr. Alan Maceinnon.
who grouped and arranged the whole of the play, was vigorous and
spirited as Faulconbridge. He delivered his insults with immense
foroe and go. The letter "r" is not an easy one for him to pro-
nounce, but he struggled manfully with this obstacle, and after a
time I got perfectly accustomed to the bold tones in which he ordered
Austria to "hang a calf-skin chround those chrechreant limbs."
King Philip's legs were, perhaps, too much inclined to independence,
and never quite seemed to have made np their minds where they
would settle down, but when once they were fixed the King was
every inch a King. Little Miss Mabel Hoabr made us all weep
copiously as Arthur. I have kept Hubert to the last, in order to
emphasise my opinion that Mr. Clare, of New College, who acted
this tender-hearted Chamberlain, carried off the chief honours of
the performance. For consistent and restrained force, it would
not have been easy to match Mr. Class's impersonation. Lady
Radnor's band was delightful, in light-blue and pink bows.
The tight in the Second Act was tremendous. Never have I seen
suoh dreadful blows delivered with such immense vigour on any
other stage. A very polite French Knight who had taken part in
the combat accorded me the honour of an interview afterwards. I
congratulated him, and suggested that so realistic a battle must
have been long and carefully rehearsed. "Rehearsals!" he laughed;
"not a bit of it. We just lace into one another's heads as hard as
we can lick." For the benefit of Mr. D'Oyly Carte and other fight-
ing managers I have given these admirable words as thev were spoken.
I had almost forgotten the ladies. There were three, Miss Ffitche,
Mrs. Charles Sim, and Miss Dowson, and they were all good—
especially Mrs. Sim as Constance.
And so farewell, for the present, to the 0. U. D. S. and to Oxford.
I may mention, by the way, that hospitality is as extensive and
port wine as abundant as ever in the neighbourhood of the High.

THE PIKK OF COURTESY, AND A TRUE BLUE.
Last week a Cambridge Graduate, a Layman, not a
Reverend Don, kindly coachtd the Oxford. Eight. The
great Duke of Wellington, courteously instructing the
French Army how to defeat the English, would be an
historical parallel. It is to be hoped that this sublime
example of unselfish devotion to squatio f port will be fol-
lowed in other walks of life. We may expeot to learn
from the daily papers how,—
On Monday a Cabinet Council was held at Downing
Street. Lord Salimiury presided, and Mr. W. H. Smith
being indisposed, Mr. W. E. Gladstone (at a moment's
notice) kindly consented to take his place.
On Tuesday General Cafrtvi went on leave, his place
as confidential adviser te the Emperor of Gfrmany being
supplied during his absence by Prince Yon Bismarck.
The Czar of Russia, wishing to take a short holiday in
Denmark, has arranged that his place shall be supplied
by Prince Alexander, onoe of Battenberg, and late of
Bulgaria. Before his return to St. Petersburg His
Majesty is likely to spend some time as the guest of
several leading Nihilists.
On Wednesday President Carnot paid a long visit to
General Boulangsr, with a view to submitting to that
eminent statesman a scheme for the reorganisation of the
French Army.
On Thursday the King of Italy, having arranged to
accompany Signor Cbispi in a yachting cruise to South
America, the Pope took up h's residence at the Qairinal,
and presided at a National Council. Later in the day his
Holiness reviewed the Roman garrison.
On Friday Mr. O'Brien gave a numerously attended
"at home" in his new prison. Amongst those present
were Mr. Gladstone, Lord Salisbury, Mr. Parnell.
Mr. McCarthy, and Mr. Tim IIealy. It is understood
that the result of this amicable meeting will be found
in a spirit of reciprocity exhibited in the anti-Parnellites
writing Mr. Parnell s manifestoes for the Parnellites,
and rice versa.
Query by Ignoramus.—From the Times' " Court Cir-
cular," Feb. 11:—"The following Ladies and Gentlemen
had the honour of receiving invitations, and being re-
ceived by Her Majesty afterwards is the Drawing Room."
Well, Sir (writes our Correspondent) and where are they
usually received? In the kitchen? The report doesn't
mention whether it was the front or back Drawing Room.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Souse of _ Commons, Monday. February 9. — The Attorney-
General, with copy of Orders in his hand, oasts reproachful, almost
angry, glance on the harmless Howorth; that great diplomatist just
dropped in from Arlington Street; been to see
the MARKI88, and give him latest instructions as
to conduct of public affairs, more especially with
respect to Behring Sea, the Northampton Elec-
tion, the Newfoundland Fisheries difficulty, and
Assisted Education. A little fatigued with his
exertions; doesn't observe Webster's wof ul regard.
"If it hadn't been for him," Attorney-Gen-
eral mutters, still glaring on elect of Salford,
"shouldn't have to be down here now, answering
thete sort of questions."
No doubt Howorth was, though undesignedly,
originator of the business. Saw in incident of
Hartlepool election an opening for minimising
effect. Wrapped purpose up in form of question
addressed to Attorney-General. Question in
subtly diplomatic form insinuated against Fur-
ness charge of breach of Corrupt Practice Aot.
Attorney-General, knowing that Howorth is
the man who pulls the strings of statecraft, not
only in Salford and London, but in Berlin and
St. Petersburg, did not venture to decline to
aniwer; gravely played up to his lead. Oppo-
sition laughed and cheered: saw their opening,
and have since diligently filled it. Scarcely day
passed since that questions on hypothetical oases,
addressed to Attorney-General, have not ap- „ .. „
peared on Orders. As they are moulded on Caustic Ciustom
Howorth's, whioh he answered fully, even genially, difficult to
refuse reply. But there must be a limit to this kind of thing;

reached to-day when caustic Causton comes forward with request
for gratuitous opinion on case submitted, involving difficult ques-
tion of eligibility of Catholics for Feat on Woolsack. Summers,
who, depressed by Irish domestic difficulty, hasn't pnt a question
for three weeks, goaded into activity: puts down another on same
subject Mr. Attorney respectfully declines.to answer either.
Opposition yell with derisive cheers.
Mr. Attorney a man of equable temper, but this too muoh for
him. Must find object of attack somewhere. Waited till Howorth
had said adieu to five ladies whom he had been showing round the
House. "Look here, Howorth," said Mr. Attobnet, nis amiable
visage olouded with unwonted wrath, "you content yourself with
looking after the Markiss, and keeping him straight, but don't
you oome round me any more with your confoundedly clever
questions."
Business done.—Tithe Bill still on Report stage.
Tuesday.—Met John Morley in corridor just now walking along
with long stride and troubled countenance. '' What's the matter?
I asked. "Is the French Revolution still troubling you, or are you
in fresh difficulties On Compromise?"
"No, dear Toby," he said; "like Martha, I am troubled with
none of these things. The fact is, I am pining for opportunity to
rive battle to Balfour in the matter of his Government of Ireland.
You remember 1 tabled notice of a Motion on the matter as soon as
the House met in November. Then I was so anxious, so absorbed
in the subject, that I forgot all about it till Brer Fox and Brer
Rabbit appeared on the scene, and bid against each other for pre-
cedence. Thereupon I pulled my Resolution out of pigeon-hole:
reminded Old Morality of my prior claim; had it admitted, and
day fixed. Should have oome on last Monday, you know. Tithe* Bill
in hand all last week: everybody tired of it; agree there's really
nothing in it; Opposition smouldering out; then suddenly, my

everyone so urgent to continue debate that House was Counted Out
on Friday; yesterday was appropriated for further debate on

put off till Monday."
"And who arranged all this P" I asked, with unfeigned sympathy.
"Well, it was our fellows, yon know, with assistance of Irish
Members. We are all so anxious to have it nut with Prince Arthur
that we made it impossible for debate on his iniquities to come on
this week. Tim Healy suddenly deve-
loped personal interest in Tithes Bill.
Put down several new Clauses. So suc-
ceeded in perhaps indefinitely deferring
debate on my Resolution. You know little,
Tobt, of the thirst for battle. It's more
exhausting than the conflict itself. You '11
excuse me. I '11 take another turn; to walk
off the restless excitement is the only hops
left for me."

honest Jons was off again, down the cor-
ridor, his red necktie gleaming in the
farther recesses like the lurid light of

ery) seconded Motion for rejection of Bill.

"Like evening bells," I said to the Member for Sark.
"More like a barrel-organ," he responded, gruffly. "Hall has the
oratorical manner of a street-preacher, and the emptiness of a tankard
that a thirsty porter has held to his lips for sixty seconds. Like
a skilfully-drawn glass of his own four-half, he's mostly froth:
only, after all, there's something under the froth in the glass of

Hirsute Hints for Lord Randolph; or, the Art of Political Make-up.
'Haxl's Hextra,'and there's nothing beneath the sound of Hall's

Sake often says nasty things; seems in particularly disagreeable
mood to-day. i Even fell fool of the inoffensive Member for Crewe.
Walter McLaren, whilst declaring himself strongly in favour of
Bill, wanted to throw it out because it didn't provide opportunity
for women to marry their deceased husband's brother.
"McLaren," snarled Sark, "is one of those typical Radicals who
have no toleration. He's the sort of man who would bite off his
nose to spite his face. Quiet, gentle, almost feminine, in his
manner, he would think nothing of boiling you and me in molten
lead if we didn't cross our t's exactly at the height he is accustomed
to do, or dotted our i's at an angle which did not conform with his
views. Scratch a Radical, Tobt my boy, and you'll find the
Tyrant."
I '11 take care to do no such thing.

202 Votes against 155.
Thursday.—After long period of anxiety, House to-night reassured.
Gedge, who hasn't been seen since he disappeared after obstructing
passage through Committee of Tithes Bill, turned up again.
Curiously regarded by House; looked for signs of privation, but no
falling off visible, whether in physical oontour or volume of voice.
Tithes Bill during his absence has gone through Committee and
Report stage. Now awaiting Third Reading. Gedge proposed to
continue his speech interrupted by stroke of Midnight, when House
in Committee. Fixed himself obligingly behind Goschen and Hicxs-
Brach, so that they should miss nothing of his counsel, and started
off. Instantly arose stormy cries for Division. Gedge, wherever he
has been, seems to have been well-fed, and kept generally in good
fettle. Cheerfully accepted challenge to vocal contest. Every time
he commencsd sentence the boisterous chorus, " 'vide I 'vide! 'vide 1"
rang though House. Opposition, who didn't want Bill, started it;
Ministerialists, anxious to see Bill pass, took it up; a roaring,
exoited crowd; amid them Gedge, grey-faced, imperturbable, with
mouth wide open, shouting in the ear of the pleased Chancellor of
the Exchequer. Business done.—Tithes Bill read Third Time by
250 Votes against 161.
Friday.—The United Services come nobly to the front to-day, all
about Nelson's Pillar in Saokville Street,
Dublin. However it may be at West-
minster, Irish Members oan't abear
obstruction at home; brought in Bill
to remove Monument lower down street;
long debate; towards close Admiral
Field suddenly hove in sight; bore

"As humble naval officer," he roared,
as through a speaking - trumpet, "I

naval hero in the words of the Poet,
saying unto him, 'Friend, go down

himself to Speaker.
Spectaole of the two veterans defend-
ing memory of Nelson deeply touohed
House. Nevertheless, Bill carried. Business done.—Counted Out at
Half-past Seven.

"In rising to respond."
In Montagu Williams' Later Leaves there is a small error, hut
of importance to the historian of the English Stage, which can be
corrected in the next edition : — Mr. Keeley never played Bob
Netties, and there is no such character in Tom Taylor's Our Clerks.
Bob Nettles is one of the principal characters in To Parents and
Guardians, and it was played by Mrs. Keeley, her husband playing
Waddilove. Middle- aged play-goers will remember both pieces; and
in the latter, no one will forget Alfred Wigan as the Frenoh Tutor.

Company present their compliments to the C. 8. Examiners, and

SPECIMENS EROM MR. PUNCH'S SCAMP-ALBUM.
No. II.—The Literary "Ghost."
We will assume, simply for the purposes
of this argument, that you, reader, are an
innocent - minded elderly lady, and a
regular subscriber to the Looal Circulating
Library. You are sitting by your com-
fortable fireside, knitting a "oross-over"
for a Bazaar, when your little
maid announces a gentleman,
who says he has not a card-
case with him, but requests
that you will see him.
"\ou are sure he is a
gentleman, Maky Ann?" you
will inquire, with a slight
uneasiness as to the um-
brellas in the hall.
"Oh, a puffict
gentleman, Mam,"
says Mart Ann—
"with a respirator."
Upon this testi-
mony to his social
standing, you direot
that the perfect gen-
tleman shall be
shown in.
Mart Ann has not deceived you—he has a respirator, also blue
spectacles, and a red nose. He apologises with fluent humility for
intruding upon you without the honour of a previous acquaintance,
and takes a chair, after which he shifts his respirator to his ohin,
sheds a pair of immense woollen gloves into his hat, and produces a
bundle of papers, over which he intreats you to cast an eye. On
perusing them, they prove to be letters from various eminent authors,
whose names are, more or less, familiar to you. These documents
are more interesting as autographs than from any intrinsic literary
merit, for they all refer to remittances for various amounts, and
regret politely that the writer is not in a position to obtain permanent
employment for his correspondent. While you are reading them,
your visitor pays assiduous court to your cat—which impresses you
favourably.
"Possibly, Madam," he suggests, "you may be personally ac-
quainted with some of those gentlemen?" When you oonfess that
you have not that honour, he seems more at his ean>.
"I asked," he says, "because I have long heard of you as a Lady
of great taste and judgment in literary matters—which, after seeing
you, I oan the more readily understand."
It is a fact that several of your nieces and female neighbours are
in the habit of declaring that they would rather take your opinion on
a novel than that of all the critics; still, you had not expected your
fame to have spread so wide.
"I had another motive," he confesses, "because, if you were inti-
mate with any of these authors, I should naturally 'esitate to say
anything which might have the effect of altering your opinion of
them. As it is, I can speak with perfect freedom—though in the
strictest confidence. You see before you, Madam, an unfortunate
bean, whom circumstanoes have 'itherto debarred from ever reaping
the fruit of his own brine! Well may you remark, 'Your Gracious
Goodness'"—[your natural astonishment having escaped you in the
shape of this invocation)—"for in your goodness and in your gracious-
ness rests my sole remaining 'ope. I was endowed from an early
age with a fertile and versatile imagination, and creative powers
whioh, without vanity, I may say, were of a rather superior class.
The one thing I lacked was mnooence, and in the world of letters,
Madam, as I am sure you do not need to be informed, without
inflooence Genius is denied a suitable opening. At several literary
Clubs in the West End I made the acquaintance of the authors
whose letters you have just had the opportunity of reading—men
who have since attained to the topmost pinnacle of Fame. At that
time they were comparatively obscure; they 'eard my conversation,
they realised that I 'ad ideers, of which they knew the value better,
perhaps, than I did myself. I used to see them taking down notes
on their shirt-ouffs, and that, bnt I took no notioe of it at the time.
Probably you have read the celebrated work of fiction by Mr. Gash-
LEIOh Walker, entitled, King Cole'i Cellars t I thought so. I
gave him the plot, scenery and characters complete, for that story.
I did, indeed.'^
"And do you mean to say he has taken all the credit himself!"
you exclaim, very properly shocked.
"If he has," he replies, meekly, "I am far from complaining—a
■hilling or two was an object to me at that time. And it got me
more work of the sort. There's Booty Bay, now, the book that
Robehtson—that was took down, word for word, from my
vol. a i
dictation, in a back parlour of one of Lockhart's Cocoa-Rooms. I got
fifteen shillings for that. He got, I daresay, 'undredi of pounds.
Well, / don't grudge it to him. As he said, I ought to remember
he had all the manual labour of it. Then there's that other book
whioh has sold its thousands, Four Men in a Funny—that was
mine—all but the last chapter; he would put in that, and, in my
opinion, spoilt it, from an artistic point. But what could I do?
It was out of my 'ands! I must say I never anticipated myself
that it would be so popular. 'I should be robbing you, I said, if I
took more than ten shillings for it.' All the same, it turned out a
good bargain for him. Then there's the Drama, you would hardly
credit it that I could name three leading theatres at this present
moment where pieces are running which came originally out of my
'ed! But it's no use my saying so—no one would believe it. And
now I've 'elped all these men up the ladder, they can do without
me—they can go alone—or think they oan. See the way they write
—not a word about owing anything to my 'umble services, a postal
order for three-and-six; but that's the world all over!"
"But surely," you will sympathetically observe, " you will expose
them, you will insist on sharing in the reward of your labours—it is
a duty you owe to the public, as well as yourself 1"
"So I've been told, Madam. But what oan IdoP—I'ma poor
man. 'Slow rises worth, by poverty depressed,' as Pope, or Gold-
smith—for a similar idea ooours in both—truly observes. To put
my case before the public as it ought to be put, I should first have to
gain the ear of the Press—and you want a golden key to do that,
nowadays. The Press is very reluctant to run down successful
writers. 'Hawks won't pick out Awkses heyes,' as Burns re-
marks. (By this time you are probably fumbling for your purse,
which, as usual, is at the bottom of your work-basket.) No, they will
find me out some day—after I'm dead and gone, most likely! _ In
the meantime I envy nobody.
I have the consciousness of Genius,
and—I'm sure your generosity
is overwhelming, Madam — I
really never ventured to—Pardon
these tears; it is the first time
my poor talents have ever ob-
tained such recognition as this!
Could you crown your favours
by giving me the names and ad-
dresses of any
charitable friends
and neighbours
whom you think
at all likely to
follow your noble
example? ... I
thank you from
my heart, Madam,
and, when I suc-
ceed in recovering
my literary in-
tan ce, and am
called upon to
issue a collected
edition of my
works, I shall
take the liberty of
inscribing on the
title-page a dedi-
cation to the gene-
rous benefactress
who first 'elped to
restore my fallen
fortunes!
With this he
seals his lips again with tW respirator, pockets his documents and
your donation, and bows himself gratefully out, leaving you to
meditate on the unecrupnlousness of popular Authors, and the i
with which a oonfiding public is hoodwinked.

been called to a circular, ifsued from

Auk," meaning the Shetland Isles,
and stating that, '• if the season is a
pretty fair one, a haul of at least
twenty thousand eggs" of rare sea-
birds might be expected.—Laxly

The "Brum" and the Oologist
"Were walking hand in hand;
They grinned to see so many birds
On eliif, and rock, and sand.

Slid they, " it would be grand."
"If we should start a Company
To gather eggs all day,
Do you suppose," the former said,

"We might," said the Oologist,
"On the promoting lay!"

And you might lead the birds a

Upon their ugly legs;
And, when you've got them out

MR. PUNCH'S PRIZE NOVELS.
Ko. XTV.—LE PÉTROLIUM; OU, LES SALOPERIES PARISIENNES.
{Par Zorgon-Gola, Auteur de " Toujours Poivre," "Charbon et Crasse,"
"La Fange," "499 Pages d'Amour," "Le Pourvoyeur Universel,"
"Une Rêveuse qui vise l'Académie."
I.—La Famille.
Si vous voulez voir les Slums- Parisiens et comprendre le Peuple
—aveo la majuscule—vous devez visiter les Saloperies, faubourg
au delà de Belleville et de Ménilmontant, faubourg où les femmes
sortent le matin en oheveux — ça ne veut pas dire comme Lady
Gobi va, mais simplement sans chapeau—acheter de la charcuterie;
et où vers minuit dans des bouges infects les hommes se coupent
le gavion, en bons zigs, après une soirée de rigolade. C'est ici qu'on
trouve des admirables exemplaires de oette nombreuse famille Egou-
Oo wash, oui, datant de Phabamosd, peuple Paris et joue tous les
rôles dans la comédie humaine. Ce n'est pas une famille tout à fait
vieille roche, voyez-vous: au contraire, ça commence dans la boue de
Provence et finit dans les égouts de Paris; mais elle est distinguée,
tout de même. Elle a son epilepsia héréditaire, belle et forte
épUepsie qu'on trouvera partout
dans oette vingtaine de romans
que je suis résolu d'éorire au
sujet des Eoou-Ogwash. C'est
une epilepsia généalogique. Il y
en a pour toute la famille.
IL—Les Poppot.
Jane Poppot se promenait sur
le Boulevard des Saloperies par
une belle matinée d'août. En
cheveux, panier sur le bras, elle
allait acheter de la charcuterie
pour le déjeuner de son mari, oui,
son mari pour de bon, chose unique
dans la famille Og wash, un vrai
mariage à la Mairie et à l'église.
Cette petite blonde, Jane, a ses
idées a elle de se ranger, de vivre
en honnête femme aveo son re-
spectable Jean Poppot qui l'adore,
au point de lui pardonner tout le
volume premier de son histoire.
Il n'y a pas dans tout Paris
ménage plus gentil que le petit
appartement au septième des
Poppot dans une cité ouvrière de
oe Betnal Grin Parisien. Tout
va bien aveo ces braves gens.
Lui, o'est le Steeple-Jack de Paris,
où il fait les réparations de tous
les toits. Elle, blanchisseuse de
fin, a développé un secret dans la
façon d'empeser les plastrons de
chemises. Elle fait des plastrons
monumentaux, luisants, dur
comme l'albâtre. Elle a des cli-
ents dans le beau monde et à
l'étranger, jusqu'au Prince de
Baleines, qui lui confie ses che-
mises de grande toilette, celles
qu'il porte au diner du Lor Maire,
par exemple.
Jane achète sa oharouterie, et après elle s'arrête au coin de la rue
pour regarder Paris. _ C'était un tic qu'elle avait, de regarder Paris.
Cela tenait de la famille Og wash. Instinot de race.
Paris, vu du hauteur des Saloperies, semble une grande marmite
pleine de boue et de sang, où les gens grouillent, se tordent,
s'empiffrent, se dévorent, et squirment dans leur propre graisse,
comme de la blanchaille sautant dans l'huile bouillante. Un nuage de
seioer-gaz monte jusqu'à Jank stationnée sur la hauteur de Belleville;
et dans oette brume puante elle sent l'odeur de femmes et del'ognon,
le cognac, le meurtre, le fricot, le mont de piété, les omnibus, les
oroquemorts, les gargotes, les bals à l'entrée libre pour dames, tout ce
qu'il y a de funeste et de choquant dans cette ville infecte.
Jane s'amuse à flairer toutes oes horreurs pendant que le pauvre
Poppot danse devant le buffet en attendant l'arlequin eu le demi
kilo de oharouterie assortie dans le panier de sa femme.
III.—Dégringolade.
Elle a dégringolé. Cela a commencé tout doucement en traînant
ses savates. Quand une femme dégringole elle traine ses savates.
C'est une loi universelle. L'on ne dégringole pas sans trainer ses
savates; l'on ne traine pas ses savates sans dégringoler. Ainsi gare
aux souliers éoulés. 0, mais elle est changée, cette pauvre p'tite

blonde! La maladie héréditaire des Egou-Ogwash vient d'être in-
diquée. Poppot, oe brave Poppot, lui aussi il dégringole. Il re-
semble à un réverbère sur le boulevard dont on oublie d'éteindre
le gaz. Il est allumé du matin au soir.
Ça a commencé si gentiment après que ce bon Steeple-Jack était
tombé du faite de Notre Dame, où il faisait des réparations. _ Le
pauvre homme a fait cette chute en regardant Jane, qui dansait le
cancan sur la Place du Parvis pour ohoquer ces crétins de Cook-touriit»,
et pour distraire son mari. C'était pendant la convalescence de
Poppot que la dégringolade a commencé. Jane lui donna un dé à
coudre de vilain cognac, et de ce premier doigt de casse-poitrine
à l'ivrognerie brutale n'était qu'une glissade, presque aussi rapide que
la glissade de Notre Dame. Poppot traînait ses savates; il chômait;
il rigolait: il gardait le Saint Lundi; il passait des journées devant
le buffet du Pétrolium, ce grand cabaret du peuple où l'on voyait
distiller le trois-six pour tout le quartier.
Jane faisait pire que dégringoler; elle cascadait. Elle ne se
débarbouillait plus. Elle avait pris en horreur le savon. Est-ce
une aversion héréditaire, datant de la première femme qui a senti
la puanteur de cet abominable savon français, avant la bienfaisante in-
vention de M. Poires Sans doute c'était l'atavisme en quelque forme.
Elle avait son béguin. C'était le
linge sale. Plus il était sale, plus
elle en raffolait. Elle ne voulait
Slus les chemises en batiste fine
u Prince de Baleines. Elle
Sriait les aristos du Jockey Club
e donner leurs plastrons à d'au-
tres. Les clients qu'elle préferait
étaient les porte-faix, les forts de
la halle, les chauffeurs du chemin
de fer. C'était en allant chercher
le linge de oes derniers qu'elle
entrait sans le savoir dans le
Dédale de cette voie ferrée qui
enlace et éorase les êtres vivants
comme les grandes roues des
locomotives écrasent la poussière
de la voie.
Le Président du P. L. M. lui
aussi avait son béguin héréditaire.
Il courait les femmes malpropres.
Plus elles ne se débarbouillaient
pas, plus il les courait. C'était
innocent. Il les admirait du côté
esthétique. Cela tenait de la
famille, puis de ce que lui aussi
était de la vieille souche des Egou-
Ogwash. Il s'allumait en lorg-
nant la figure noircie de cette
pauvre Jane, et la rencontrant
dans la gare un jour il se permit
un peu de flirtàge sans penser à
mal. Mais par une fatalité,
Poppot, affreusement paf, des-
cendait d'une quatrième classe
au moment ou le vieux baisait la
main crasseuse de Jane, en lui
disant son gentil bon soir: et des
cet instant Poppot voyait ronge.
IV.—Subinade.
Il voyait rouge. Paris lui sem-
blait un abattoir. Il couvait le
meurtre, et pour l'aider il avait un complice qui était du métier,
Jacques Eispère, condnoteur de machines sur le P. L. M., qui avait
aussi sa manie héréditaire, et sa manie à lui était de couper les gorges.
Il les coupait sans rancune, à l'improyiste, en souriant à sa victime,
les yeux dans les yeux. Crio! c'était fait. Par exemple il est des-
cendu un jour de la locomotive et devant le buffet d'une station où il
n'y avait pas trop de monde il a suriné la barmaid qui lui souriait en
loi vendant une brioche. Il a égorgé son chauffeur au risque
d'arrêter le train de luxe entre Avignon et Marseilles. On ne le
punit pas. Cela tenait de la famille.
'' Touche là, mon drôle! C'est oonvenu," dit Jacques Eispère, après
un entretien de quelques heures devant le buffet du Pétrolium.
"Moi, j'arrangerai tout cela aveo les fonctionnaires. Le train
arrivant de Qénève doit passer le Rapide entre Maçon et Dijon.
Il ne passera pas. Je retarderai le train omnibus arrivant de Mar-
seilles. J'accélérerai le irain-luggage arrivant de Paris. Il y aura une
mêlée de quatre trains, entrechoqués, tordus, enlacés, faisant le
fique-à-baque: et pendant oette mêlée j'égorgerai oe vieux mnfe de
résident. C'est simple."
"Comme bon jour," répondit Poppot, aveuglément soûl.
Eispère tenait parole. A onze heures du soir il y avait une de
ces catastrophes qui font frémir l'Europe voyageuse. L'assassin ne

LISTENING TO THE GENTLE KOOEN.
Maw Marian is "a Comic Opera in Three Acts," at least so 1
gather from the title-page of the book and from the programme of
the Prince of Wales's Theatre; thongh where the comicality comes
in, except occasionally with Mr. Monkhouse, it would require Sum
Wetter'i "pair o' patent double
million magnifyin' gas microscopes
of hextra power" to deteot. Mr. Le
Hat, too, has nothing like the
opportunity which was given him
in Prince Bulbo. Now, when in a
so-called Comic Opera your two
principal low comedians
nave very little to do, say,
or Bing, and when that
little is not of a particu-
larly side-splitting cha-
racter, and when the plot
is not replete with comic
situations, such a work
must depend for its suc-
cess on the freshness of its
melodies, on the popularity
of its artistes, and on the
> excellence of its mise-en-
scene.
As to the last of these
essentials, if, perhaps, it
is not so brilliantly placed
, ,, , c . . TII on the stage as some other
Libretto by 8m th. As be app, ar* m Act III., . . ". . f.
"hammering at it." 8now! nave Deen'7ret ™?re
is plenty of Hamsian
movement, due always to the devices in stage-management of
Charles of that ilk, who certainly knows how to keep the Chorus
moving and the game alive generally.
The yet existing admirers of the once enormously popular com-
poser, Offenbach, among whom I certainly include myself, will be
much gratified by the delicately introduced reminiscences of the
work of that master of opera oouffe which occasionally orop up
during the performance of Maid Marian. If it be permissible for
great Masters to repeat themselves, as notably more than one has
lone, may not little Masters exhibit the results of their profound
studies in the sohools of popular ComposersP Surely they may;
and was I not pleased with Mr. Dk Kooen (whose name seems to
suggest "the voice of the turtle,"—the dove, not the soup) when his
prelude to the Third Act distinctly recalled to my attentive mind
the celebrated unison effect in L'Africaine, only without the
marvellous jump, which, when first heard, thrilled the audience,
and compelled an enthusiastic encore? Then Miss Violet Camebon
sang a song about the bells, with a ohorus not in the least like that
in Lei Cloches de Corneville you understand, because the latter, I
think, is performed without the bells sounding, but in this there is a
musical peal which intensifies the distinction between the two. This
"number" was encored heartily, nay, I think it was demanded three
times, and came just at the right moment to freshen up the enter-
tainment. In the previous Aot Miss Attalik Claire had had a good
song which had also obtained an encore, thoroughly well deserved as
far as her singing was concerned.
I forget what Mr. Cofein had to sing, but, whatever it was, he
did it more than justice, as did also the batto profondo, whose efforts
in producing his voice from, apparently, his boots, were crowned
with remarkable success.
The Friar Tuck here is a kind of good old-fashioned burlesque
Friar, more like that one some years ago at the Gaiety, in Little
JRobin Hood than the Friar in Ivanhoe. But I should say that
this Friar would be uncommonly thankful to have got anything
like the song that Sir Arthur has given hit Friar over the way,
{ or something even as good as Mr. Dallas had to sing, years ago, —

in It feck's Gaiety Burlesque. However, perhaps it was not intended
for a singing part, and perhaps the aotor who plays it is not a pro-
fessional singer. We 're not all of us born witn silver notes in our
chests.
I see that Mr. Horace Sedoeb announces the drama in action,
entitled L'Enfant Prodigue, which recently made suoh a hit in
Paris. Wonder how it will go here. Not knowing, can't prophesy.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The Baron thanks Sir Henry Thompson for his Food and Feed-
ing, which (published by Warne & Co., a suggestive name) has
reached its sixth edition. It is, indeed, an entertaining work, and
a work that all honest entertainers should carefully study. It will
delight alike the host and the guest. To the first, Sir Henbt,
being a host in himself, oan give suoh valuable advice as, if acted
upon, will secure the ready pupil a position as a Lucullus of the
first class; and, even when so placed, he will still have much to
learn from this Past Grand Master in the art of living well and
wisely. "Fas est ab * hoste' doceri"—and a better host it would
be difficult to find as teacher than Sir Henbt Thompson, P.G.M., to
whose health and happiness the Baron quaffs a bumper of burgundy
of the right sort and at the right time. Most opportunely does this
book appear in the season of Lent, which may be well and profitably
spent in acquiring a thorough knowledge of how to turn to the best
account the flesh pots of Egypt, when the penitential time is past,
and the yolk of mortification is thrown off with the welcome return
of the Easter Egg. Read attentively what our guide and friend
has to say about salads, especially note his remarks on the salad of
"cold boiled table vegetables." His arrangement of the menu, to
the Baron's simple taste, humble mode of life, and not inconsider-
able experience, is perfect. Hors d'osuvres are works of supereroga-
tion, and have never been, so to speak, acclimatised in our English
table-land. The Baron may have overlooked any directions about
Scrivisses, not as bisque, but pure and simple as cray-fish, whioh,
fresh from the river and served hot and hot come in late but
welcome as an admirable refresher to the palate, and as a relish
for the champagne, though the Baron is free to admit that the dainty
manipulation of them is somewhat of a trial to the inexperienced
guest, especially in the presence of "Woman, lovely Woman."
"Hesse afore helegance," was Mr. Welter's motto, but "Ease
combined with elegance may be attained in a few lessons, whioh
any skilled M.D.E. (»'.«., Manoeur d'icrivisses) will be delighted to
give at the well-furnished table of an apt and ardent pupil. Onoe
more " Your health, Sir Henrt!" that's the Baron's toast (bread
not permitted) in honour of the eminent practician who does so
much for the health of everybody.
That a considerable number of novel-readers like Saint Monica,
ca5Jv^ by Mrs. Bennett-Edwards, is evi-
dent, because it has reached its
sixth edition, but that the Baron is
not one of this happy number he is
tain to admit. Saint Monica seems
to him to be a
story with which
the author of At
in a Looking-
Olass might have
done something
in his peculiar
way. It begins
with promise,
which promise is
not justified by
performance.
Who does not
welcome the
works of Hawlby Smart, the brightest of our novelists? This is
not a conundrum, and, consequently, has no answer. Everybody
likes the books of our literary Major, and everybody will be pleased
with The Plunaer. The new Story is in two volumes, and is full
of incident. There is a murder, whioh carries one through, from
the first page to the last, in a state of breathless excitement. Not
that the tale commences with the tragedy. But its anticipation is as
delightful as its subsequent realisation; and, when the mystery is
solved, joy becomes universal. The story is told with so light a hand,
that it may be truly said that the only " heavy" thing about the
book is its title.
The Autobiography of Joseph Jefferson is a good stout volume,
full of portraits and interest from beginning to end, forming an
important addition to the theatrical history of the day. The Baron
drinks to his old friend, the greatest Rip that ever lived. "Here's
your health, and your family's, and may you live long, and
prosper 1" says, heartily, The Baron be Boor-Worms.

DUMAS UP TO ARMY ESTIMATES' DATE.
Part I.—The Three Volunteer*.
Lieutenant Porthos, Captain^ Athos, and
Major A it amis were delighted with the pro-
gress discernible in every detail of the
battalion to which it was their honour to
belong. Not a man that did not appear on
parade conscious of the f aot that he had made
himself proficient—the privates were con-
tented, the non-commissioned officers happy.
It was, indeed, a model Regiment. On the
occasion of their inspection by Colonel
D'Artagnax, a man marched from the
ranks, and demanded a hearing.
"And what do you want?" asked the
inspecting officer.
'• We wish the unjust to be made just,"
returned the discontented one. "We ask
for a reform."
Porthos, Athos, and Aramis would have
protested, but Colonel D'Abtagnan motioned
them to be silent. "I am here," he mur-
mured, "to listen to complaints. I must
listen to his."
"Sir," said the complainant, "we have
admirable officers—the Lieutenant, the Cap-
tain, and the Major. They are always at
work."
"Yes," returned Colonel D'AaTAGNAif;
"and so are you."
"But we have merely to obey orders, and
not to command. We feel that although we
pay for everything connected with the bat-
talion, we should do something more. We
ought to subscribe a sum to pay our excellent
officers for commanding us 1"
And Porthos, Athos, and Aramis refused
the suggestion, to the great disappointment
of their subordinates.
Part II.—Twenty Yean Afterwards,
Lieutenant Porthos, Captain Athos, and
Major Aramis were once again being inspected
by D'Artagnan, now wearing the gold and
crimson scarf of a general officer.
"Yes, I have a complaint to make," replied
one of the rank and file, in reply to the
customary interrogation. "We nave three
officers; Dut they have merely to give orders,
while we have to obey them. This is unfair
—unjust. We are always at work."
"Yes," returned General D'Artagnan,
"and so are they.'
'True enough.
We feel that, although
for the battalion, they
they pay i
should do more. They ought to compensate
their excellent privates for the time we devote
to obeying them."
And'Porthos, Athos, and Aramis accepted
the suggestion, to the great delight of their
subordinates.
Part III.—Ten Years Later.
Lieutenant Portho9, Captain Athos, and
Major Aramis were yet again on parade.
'• I salute you, my friends," said Field
Marshal D'Artagnan, the inspecting officer.
"But where is your Regiment?"
Porthos looked at Athos, and Athos
glanced at Aramis. Then they replied in a
Breath, "It has been disbanded."
'' Disbanded!" eohoed D'Artagnan. '1 But
where are the accounts of the Corps f"
Then the three friends replied in a mourn-
ful tone. "Filed in the Court of Bank-
ruptcy I"
And what do you call this filing of officers'
accounts in the Court of Bankruptcy f"
"We call it the last act of the Volunteer
Movement, which, by the way, however, was
not entirely voluntary!"
And the four friends having no further
occupation requiring their joint attention,
shook hands warmly, and parted—for ever!
MEN WHO HAVE TAKEN ME IN-
TO DINNER.
(By n Dinner-Belle.)
No. I.—Thb Over-cultured Undergraduate.
He stood, as if posed by a column,
Awaiting our hostess' advance;
Complacently pallid and solemn,
He deigned an Olympian glance.
Ioy cool, in a room like a orater,
He silently marched me down-stairs,
And Mont Blanc oould not freeze with a
greater
Assurance of grandeur and airs.

I questioned if Balliol was jolly—
Your epithet," sighed he, "means noise.
Yile noise! At his age it were folly
To revel with Philistine boys."
Competition, the century's vulture,
Devoured academical fools;
For himself, utter pilgrim of Culture,
He countenanced none of the Schools.
Exams: were a Brummagem fashion
Of mobs and inferior taste;
They withered "Transluoence" and "Pas-
sion."
They vulgarised leisure by haste.
Self to realise—that was the question,
Inscrutable still while the cooks
Of our Colleges preached indigestion,
Their Dons indigestible books.
Two volumes alone were not bathos,
The one by an early Chinese,
The other, that infinite pathos,
Our Nursery Rhymes, if you please.
He was lost, he avowed, in this era;
His spirit was seared by the West,
But he deemed to be Monk in Madeira
Would probably suit him the best.
"Impressions of Babehood" in plenty
Succeeded, " Hot youth" and its tears,
Till I wondered if ninety or twenty
Summed up his unbearable years.
Great Heavens! I turned to my neighbour,
A Squarson by culture unblest;
And welcomed at length in field-labour
And foxes refreshment and rest.
Question op the Knight.—If it be true, as
was mentioned in the World last week, that
Mr. Justice Wright has'' climbed down," only
to be placed upon a higher perch, will any
change of name follow on the Knighthood?
Will he be known as Sir Robert Kong, late
Mr. Justice Wright?

MR. PUNCH TO MISS CANADA.
Oh, Canada, dear Canada, we shall not discombobulate
Ourselves concerning Jonathan. 'Tie true he tried to rob yon late

But Bcu. has learned the wisdom of not kicking; np a bobbery.
No, Canada, we love you dear, and shall be greatly gratified
If by your March Elections our relations are—say ratified.
We don't expeot self-sacrifice, we do not beg for gratitude,
But keep an interested eye, my dear, upon your attitude.
Bailings and ravings rantipolo we hold are reprehensible,
But of our kindly kinship we 're affectionately sensible.
A mother's proud to see her child learning to run alone," you know;
But does not wish to see her "run away" from home, she'll own
you know.
Macdonald is magniloquent, perhaps a bit thrasonical;
His dark denunciations—at a distance—sound ironical,
And when we read the rows between him and Sir Richard Cart-
whig iit; dear. [right, dear!
We have our doubts if either chief quite plays the patriot part
But there, we know that party speeches are not merum nectar, all,
And we can take the measure of magniloquence electoral;

But when they have to drink it- oold—its strength they greatly

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIAET OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Common*, Monday Night, February 16.—After long
tarrying, House once more justified its old character. Been dolefully
dull these weeks and months past. Thought it was dead; only been
sleeping. To-night woke up, and audience that filled every Bench,
blocked the Gangways, and thronged the Bar, had rare treat
Occasion was the indictment of Prince Arthur; long pending;
was to have come off at beginning of Session: put off on account
of counter attractions in Committee-Room No. 15; postponement
no longer possible; and here we are, House throbbing with excite-
ment, Old Morality nervously clacking about Treasury Bench,
bringing his chicks together under his wing. Randolph brought
bis young beard down to witness performance.
Initial difficulty in Irish
Camp: Brer Fox sitting in
old place, two steps down
third bench below Gangway.
Brer Rabbit, sunk in pro-
found meditation, oblivious
to the rival Leaders presenoe,
occupies corner seat; room
for one between them. Who
shall take it f Anxious time
for Tim Healt. Nothing he
dreads so muoh as possibility
of outbreak. In Committee-
Room No. 15, Brer Fox
snatched out of Brer Rabbit's
hand a sheet of paper. Sup-
pose now, in sudden parox-
ysm, he were to reach forth
and taking Brer Rabbit by
the beard bang his head
against the back of the Bench?
Tim's gentle nature shivered
with apprehension; thing to
do was to get a good plump
gentleman set between the
two, so that in oase hostilities
broke out his body might be
used as buffer. Thought of
Eltoh first. Besides a pro- A Buff|f ft-C.
fessional desire to find occupation for Members of the Bar, Elton's
figure seemed made on purpose for the peaceful errand Tlx had in
mind. Broaehed subject. Elton said, always happy to oblige; but
was, in fact, just now retiring from Parliamentary life; didn't care
to be brought into undue prominence. Besides, he belonged to other
side of House; Why not try T. B. Potter P


A SENSITIVE EAR.
Intelligent Briton. "But we have no Theatre, no Actors worthy
of the name, mademo ssi lb i why, thb english delivery of
Blank Virus is simply torture to an Ear accustomed to hear
it oivbn its full beauiy and significance by a bernhardt or
A Coquelin I"
Mademoiselle. "Indp.fi>? I have nrvir heard Bernhardt or
Coquelin recite English Blank Verse 1"
Intelligent Briton. "Or course not. I mean Frbxcb Blank
Verse—the Blank Verse of Corneille, Racine, Moliere I"
Mademoiselle, "Oh, Monsieur, there is no such tbino!"
[Briton still tries to look intelligent.
"The very man!" cried Tim, "I believe you and be scale the
same to a pound, and though your waist is more shapely, he has the
advantage in shoulders."
Potter most obliging of men; offered no objection. So Tim con-
ducted him to the seat; he dropped gently, but firmly in it; Brer
Rabbit putting on hie spectacles, and looking across the expanse of
T. B.'s shoulders, thought he recognised Brer Fox at the other side.
Anyhow, he was beyond speaking distance, and so embarrassment
was obviated.
Tim, his mind thus at rest, able to devote his attention to debate,
to progress of which, he contributed a few interjections. Finally, when
Division taken on John Mo bxet's Motion, and everybody ready to go
home, he moved and carried Adjournment of Debate.
Business done.—Prince Arthur indicted for breach of Constitu-
tional Law in Ireland. Jury retired to oonsider their verdict. Agreed
upon acquittal by 320 Votes against 245.
Tuesday.—A once familiar presenoe pervades House to-night.
Everyone more, or less vaguely, conscious of it. Even without
chancing to look np to Peers' Gallery, Members are inspired with
sudden mysterious access of Moral Influence. Old Morality him-
self, that overflowing reservoir of moral axioms, takes on an aggra-
vated air of responsibility and respectability. Has had a great
triumph which would inflate a man of less modest character.
Last night, or rather early this morning, Irish Members appeared to
force Government hand; just when it seemed that Russell's Amend-
ment was about to be substituted for Morley's Resolution, Tim
Healy interposed, moved Adjournment of Debate; Old Morality
protested; Sexton slily threatened all-night sitting; after an hour's

struggle, Government capitulated; Adjournment agreed to; Irish
Members went otf jubilant.
To-night Sexton asks Old Morality when they Bhall resume
debate?
"Ah," says Old Morality, with look of friendly interest, as if
the idea had struck him for the first time, " yes; just so. The Hon.
Member wants to know when we shall resume the debate, the
adjournment of whioh he and his friends were instrumental in
carrying at an early hour this morning. Well, I must say, on the
part of Her Majesty's Government, that we
are perfectly satisfied with matters as they
were left. We had a lively debate, a majority
much larger than we had dared to hope for,
and, as far as we are concerned, I think we '11
leave matters alone. As one of our great
prose-writers observed, it is, on the whole,
more conducive to comfort to endure any
inconveniences that may press upon one at
the current moment, than to hasten to en-
counter others with the precise nature of
which we do not happen to be acquainted."
Grand Cross missed this delightful little
episode, not coming in till questions were
over. Now he sat in Peers' Gallery and
gazed through spectacles on ecene of earlier
triumphs. Looks hardly a day older than
when he left us; the same perky manner,
the same wooden visage, with its pervading
air of supreme self-satisfaction and inscru-
table wisdom. It is a night given up to
Indian topics. Plowden, in his quiet,
effective way, has just carried Motion which
will have substantial effect in the direction
of securing fuller debate of Indian ques-
tions. Gokst, standing at table replying to
Buchanan on another Indian topic, alludes
with deferential tone to " the Secretary of
State." Grind Cross almost audibly purrs
from his perch in the Gallery.
"An odd world, my masters," says the Member for Sark, striding
out impatiently, when yon have a man like Gorst Under-Secre-
tary, with a man like Grand Cross at the Head of the Department."
Business done.—An hour or two given to India.
Thursday.—Army Estimates on to-night. Hanbury comes to
the front, as usual. Stanhope tossing about on Treasury Bench, in
considerable irritation.
"What's the use, my St. John," he asked Brodrick, the only man
standing by him, of a family arrangement like ours, if one is
subjected to annoyance like this? With one brother in the Peers,
a pillar of staid Conservatism; with myself on the Treasury Bench,
a Cabinet Minister, a right-hand man of the Government: and then,
final touch, old Philip
Eoaliti: below the Gang-
way opposite, with his Radi-
calism, and his tendency to
out-J A CO by Labouchere.
This is a broad-based family
combination, that ought to
make us, each in his way,
irresistible. And yet there
seems nothing to prevent a
fellow like Hanbury look-
ing down from his six feet
two scornfully on a British
soldier not more than five
feet four in his stocking-
feet, whilst he inflates his
ohest, and asks, in profound
bass notes, how are the
ancient glories of the British
Army to be maintained with

When Hanbury sat

nearly an hour, Stanhope
got up and prodded him re-
proachfully. _ Wonderful

recently spent some time in Boulogne) says, en route pour lee chiene:
the Secretary of State for War demonstrating that everything is
in apple-pie order, and his right honourable predecessor on the Front
Opposition Bench bearing testimony to the general state of efficiency.
Wolmek flashed through the haze a word that has long wanted
saying in the House. Why, he asked, place sentries surrounding
St. James's Palace, the War Offioe, and the Horse Guards? Why, if
presenoe of armed men at these particular gateways is essential to
proper oonduot of affairs of Department—why should Charity Com-
missioners and Education Office be left unguarded P Wolmek should
keep pegging away at this question till he gets common-sense answer.
Business done.— Army Estimates moved.
Friday.—Gallant little Wales took the floor to-night. Wants
the Church Disestablished; Pritchard Morgan, in speech of pro-
digious length, asked House to sanction the proposal. The Govern-
ment, determined to oppose Motion, cast about for Member of their
body who could best lead opposition. Hadn't a Welshman on the
Treasury Bench.
"There's Raises, you know," Akers-Douolas said, discussing
the matter with Old Morality. "He's not exactly a Welshman,
but, when he's at home, he lives in Denbighshire, which is as near
being Wales as yon can get. Besides, his postal address is
Llwynegrin."
"Ah!" said Old Morality, "that looks well. He's not the
rose, but he lives in convenient contiguity to the flower."
So Raises was put up, and a nice, peaceful, soothing, insinuating,
conciliatory speech he made. In fact, as the Member for Sark says,
"He got gallant little Wales down on its back, tied its horns and
heels together, partially flayed it, and then rubbed in ounningly
oontrived combination of Cayenne pepper and vinegar."
Business done.—Welsh Disestablishment Motion negatived by 235

OUT OF SCHOOL!
Dear Mr. Punch,—You are so awfully good to chaps at sohool that
I am sure you will insert this letter. Smith Minor, who takes in the
Times, says, that a "Parent" has been writing to say, that there
should be a meeting of Fathers to swagger over the meeting of Head
Masters. Well, this wouldn't be half a bad idea if it were properly
conducted; but the "Parent" seems to be a beast of a governor,
who wants to cut down the holidays, and suoh like rot. And this
brings me to what I want to propose myself. If there are to be
meetings of Head Masters and Parents, why not a meeting of Boys?
We have a heap of grievances. For instance, lots of ohaps would
like to know why "the water" was stopped at Westminster, and
something about the domestio economy of Harrow. Then the great
and burning question of grub is always ready to hand. The
"Parent" wants to have a hand in the payment for sohool-books,
seeing his way to getting the discount (stingy chap!) then why
shouldn't we fellows have a voioe choosing them? Then about
taking up Greek, why shouldn't we have our say in that matter?
After all, it interests us more than anyone else, as we are the
fellows that will have to learn it, if it is to be retained. Then
about corporal punishment. Not that we mind it mnoh, still tee are

Surely the Boys know more about a licking than Head Masters

delegate; and by publio school, I do not limit the term to the old
legitimate "E. and the two W.'s," Eton, Winchester and West-
minster. No; I would throw it open to suoh respectable educational
establishments as Harrow. Rugby, Charterhouse, St. Paul's, Marl-
borough, Felsted, Cheltenham, Stonyhurst, and the rest of them.
The more the merrier, say I; and if there was a deoided division
of opinion on any subject, we oould settle the matter off-hand at
once, by taking off our jackets and turning up our shirt-sleeves.

'"A GOOD LITTLE 'UN IS BETTER THAN A BAD BIG »UN.HL-C<A JMta.)
A Bit of Modern Boxiana.

"110-Ton Guns do not count for any practical purpose . . . These monsters
are the laughing-stock of everyone who takes the smallest interest in the
subject. They are quite indefensible, and not worth making, even if they
were unobjectionable, for the simple reason that everything we require can
be done by smaller weapons ... It is believed that more of these useless
monsters are to be made by way of reserve. It is an insane policy, desirned
simply to save somebody's amour propre, and we still hope to hear from Lord
Qioboi Hamilton that it has been abandoned."—" The Times " on the
Naval EttimaUt.
"Thai a good little 'un is better than a bad big 'un." is an old and
accepted maxim amongst the really knowing ones of the P. R. It
is one, however, that now, as of yore, swell backers, self-conceited
amateurs, and other pugilistic jugginses are apt to ignore or forget.
Where, we wonder, would the slab-sided "Sprawleybridge Babe"
or the shambling "Baldnob the Titan" have been in front of the
small but active and accomplished "Duodecimo Dumps"? Why,
where the vaunted "Benioia Boy" would have been after fifty
rounds with Tom Bayers— with his "Auctioneer" in full play. In
faot, when a good little 'un meets a bad big 'un, it is very soon a
case—with the latter—of "bellows to mend," or "there he goes
with his eye out 1"
These remarks have been suggested by recent revelations concern-
ing that much over-rated pet of the mugs—the "Woolwich
Whopper," alias the " Elswiok Folly," alias Hamiltoh's " Mbvioe."
The " W. W." always was a fraud, and, for all his lumbering bulk
and " MoLlNKAUX-like" capacity of tatur-trap," never could train-
on soundly, or—figuratively speaking—" spank a hole in a pound of
butter." Many cleverish trainers, and still more ambitious backers

of the "Corinthian Jay" species, have had a shy, pro-
fessionally or monetarily, at the " Woolwioh Whopper,"
and invariably with disastrous results. The "W. W.,"
though big enough in all conscience, is not of sound con-
stitution, nor of the true wear-and-tear sort, is very diffi-
cult (and expensive) to train, and when brought fairly up
to the scratch is certain to go bang to pieces after the first
few rounds, if these are at all of a hot-and-hot character.
Still there are—worse luck!—certain parties connected,
more or lets, with the P.R. who—whether from interest,
vanity, or sheer cussedness, still pin their faith to this
"huge, lumbering, soft, long-shanked, top-heavy,
shambling, thump-shirking Son of a Gun," as Nobby
Nuprins, of the Nautical Division, pithily called him
the other day. If some of these credulous or conceited
ooves had witnessed the little trial " sorap " which took
place reoently (on the strict Q.T.), at the "Admiral's
Head," in the presence of Mr. John B -ll (the famous
P.R. referee), between the vaunted "Whopper" and
a smart and handy light-weight known as " Quiokfire,"
their owl-eyes might, having been a little opened, and
their peacock-strut a bit modified.
The " Woolwioh Whopper," for all his height and over-
whelming weight, seemed to toe the scratch with awkward
reluctance. He put up his dukes very f amblingly, and his
attitude was decidedly of the " head-over-tip" character.
Young " Quick tire," on the contrary, was erect as a dart,
nimble on his pins as a girl at her first dance, and smart in
delivery as a newly-promoted Postman, or the Parcels
Express. He was all over his man in a brace of shakes,
ana the '' Whopper," who looked as though he could have
knocked holes in him if he oould have hit him, could
hardly land a "little one in" once in the course of a
round, and then it was so short that it would hardly have
brushed a bumble-bee off a buttercup.
The respected Referee, who watched the dust-up with
careful interest, was much pleased with the promise of
the smart light-weight, "Quiokfire," who seems to have
in him the makings of a fine fighter. Mr. B-ll did not
disguise his disgust at the feeble figure out by the
"Whopper," about whose pretensions to first-olass form,
let alone Champion honours, it is to be hoped we shall
hear little more for the future.
[Mem.—Mr. Punch suspects that the above edifying and
idiomatic homily was intended for some sporting contemporary,
but, with his accustomed courtesy, he gives it for what it in
worth.]
TO A COMPLIMENTARY COUNSEL.
[" Here the Plaintiff met the Defendant, who formed a
■*rong attachment for her, at which he (the learned Counsel),
did not wonder."— Extract from a recent Report]
Thr Plaintiff she was very fair—
I'd very gladly make a verse on
Her face, her smile, her eyes, her hair,
Her comely and attractive person.
Last year a gentleman had stormed
Her heart and swore that nought should sunder
The strong attachment he had formed,
At which you said you " did not wonder.'"
Oh! tell me was it quite the thing,
Of prudence shamelessly defiant,
In suoh a pointed way to sing
The praises of your pretty client.
Had she been ugly—yes, or plain,
Would you have reckoned it your du'y
To say how muoh it caused you pain
To look and mark her lack of beau<y?
Perhaps vou meant the words you sai 1,
'Twould be amusing to discover
If she had really turned your head,
And in her lawyer found a lover.
Yet even should this be the case,
You cannot well escape supporting
This statement—that it's not the place
In open Court to go a-courtinp.
When next a lady comes to say
That He and She at last have parted,
And that she '11 make the villain pay
For having left her broken-hearted.
You '11 recollect that in the Breach
Of Promise Case, yon must not blunder,
But mention in your opening speech
That at his love you do not wonder.

RECOGNITION OF MERIT.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The Quiet Mrt. Fleming is very nearly being a good novel of the kind with
which "once upon a time " Mr. F. C. Philips used to delight us. Mr. Richard
Psych's Quiet Mrs. F. might perhaps be placed in the tame oategory with
F. C. P.'s Little Mrt. Murray, whioh was not by any means the Author's best.
The story, like the Consols, is good enough for those who don't want much
interest for their money. It may be safely recommended as a pleasant companion
during a railway journey. The Baron does not consider that The Quiet Mrs. F.
will make muoh noise in the novel-reading world.
A coloured leaflet, of autumnal tint, commands me, in the tone of a Wellington
dispatoh, to "order early" a new "Family Magazine," entitled, Golden Oatet,
edited by John Strange Winter. "I have not yet seen it," says the Baron,
"but wish the adventurous pennyworth every possible success." Its bill of
contents announces " a complete story," by the editress, and also a " complete
novelette," by Mrs. Lovett Cameron. This looks well for the first number;
and an editor's motto must be, "Take care of Number One." I suppose in
each number there will be " A Winter's Tale."
Interesting reading for the Baron and his friends the Public, is Mr. Ander-
son's article, entitled Studies in Illustrated Journalism, in this month's Magazine
of Art, Mr. Anderson is a trifle inaccurate in some details of his pleasantly-
written and general! y trustworthy sketch of the history of Mr. Punch, on whioh it is
needless for the Baron to dwell Arc ft nunc. The Baron remembers the dapper,
sportingly-attired " little Howard," who had the reputation of being "Leech's
only pupil," but who was never one of Mr. Punch's Staff Officers. In the same
number of this Magazine is a brief, but carefully written notice of the Baron's
old friend, convive, and fellow-worker on Mr. Punch's staff, Charles Kiene.
"A superb Artist," writes Mr. SriBLMAW, "pure and simple "—true this, in
every sense—"the greatest master of line in black and white that will live for
many years to come." The engraving that accompanies this notice of our old
friend is not a striking likeness of "Carlo," but it exactly reproduces his
thoughtful attitude, with his pipe in his hand, so familiar to all his associates.
Hereby and herewith thanks-a-many are returned to the " Bibliographer,"
who is also the Secretary of the Setto of Odd Volumes, for his charming little
brochure about Robert Moudin, hie Life and Magical Deeds, by his truly,
The Baron de Book-Worms.

Or teach the babe in arms to say,
"Base, bold, bad boys are cheap to-
day"?
Nark. The White Witch.
Sonqgun scarcely knew what
to do. He _ had been up all
day, wandering about the lanes
whioh surrounded the family
mansion. A fitful light blazed
in his magnificent eyes, his
brow contracted until it assumed
that peculiarly battered expres-
sion whioh is at once character-
istic of a bent penny and con-
sistent with the most sublime
beauty. To be properly appre-
ciated he must be adequately
described. Imagine then a
young man of twenty, who was
filled with the bitterest hatred
of the world, which he had
forsworn two years ago, on
being expelled from school for
gambling. There was about
him an air of haughty reserve
and of indifference whioh was
equally haughty. This it was
his habit to assume in order
to meet any neighbours who
happened to meet him, and the
result naturally was that he
was not so popular as some
inferior beings who were less
haughty. In faot he had a
very short way with his rela-
tions, for whose benefit he kept
a Bhell into whioh he frequently
retired. He was dangerously
handsome, in the Italian style,
and often played five bars of musio over and over again, with
one finger, to please his mother. Some women thought he was an
Apollo, others described him as an Adonis, but everybody in-
variably ended or began by calling him an ancient Roman. He
was sarcastic, satiric, and very strong. Indeed, on one occasion,
he absolutely broke the feathers on a hand-Boreen, and on another
he oracked three walnuts in succession without looking up. But,
oh, the sufferings that young heart had undergone. Slapped by
his nurse, reproved by his mother, expelled by his schoolmaster,
and shunned by the society of the country-side, it was small wonder
that the brave soul revolted against its fellow-men, and set its jaws
in a proud resolve to lash the unfeeling world with the contempt of a
spirit bruised beyond the power of such lotions as the worldly-wise
recommended for the occasion. He whistled to his dog Stray, and
clenched his fists in impotent anger. An expression of gentleness
stole over his features. The idea was suggestive. He, too, the
proud, the honourable, the upright would steal, and thus punish the
world. He looked into his make-up box. It contained bitter
defiance, angry scorn, and a card-sharper's pack of cards. He took
them out; and thus Sonog on , the expelled atheist, made up his mind.
Chapter II.
On the green table of life the eards fall in many ways, and the proud king
often has to bow his head before the meek and unassuming ace.—Binns.
Ann now began for Sonogon a time of moral stress and torture

such as he had never anticipated. It is an old saying, and perhaps
(who knows P) a truism, that virtue is its own reward, not, perhaps,
the reward that ambitious people look for, but the easy consciousness
of superiority whioh comes to those who feel themselves to be on a
higher level than the rest of the world, whioh struggles on a lower
level. Another philosopher, nameless, but illustrious, has declared,
in burning words, that" Honesty is the best policy," best in some form,
perhaps hardly understood now, but no less real because we are un-
able to appraise it in the ourrent coin of the realm over whioh Her
Most Gracious Majesty, whom may Heaven preserve, holds sway.
But Sonogun had never thought of Heaven. To him, young, proud,
gloomy, and moody, Heaven had seemed only (8everal chapters
of theological disquisition omitted.—Ed.) The click of the billiard-
balls maddened him, the sight of a one made him rave like a maniac.
One evening he was walking homeward to Drury Lane. He had
given his ooat to a hot-potato-man, deeming it, in his impulsive
way, a bitter satire on the world's neglect, that the senseless tubers
should have jaokets, while their purveyor lacked a ooat. The rain
was pouring down, but it
mattered little to him. He
had wrapped himself in that
impenetrable mantle of cold
scorn, and thus he watched
with a moody air the crowd of
umbrella-carrying respectabili-
ties, who hurried on their way
without a thought of him.
Suddenly some one slapped him
on the back, and, as he turned
round, he found himself face to
face with a couple of seedy-
looking gentlemen.
"I perceive," began Sono-
gun, that you hate the world,
having suffered muoh injustice
from it."
"We do: we have 1" was the
cordial reply.
"I,too,"continued Sonogun,
"have many grievances. But
tell me who and what are you P"
"Our names are unknown
even to ourselves," replied his
new friends, for friends he felt
them to be. "By profession we
are industrial knights. That
should be sufficient."
"It is;—more than suffi-
cient," said the proud, honour-
able young man. "I will be
one of you. We will take it
out of the world together."
The bargain thus made was
soon ratified. They procured
cards, Sonogc.n whistled to his
dog Stray, and they all set out
together to the [nearest railway
station to piok up their victims.
This is the usual method, and
thus card-sharpers are manu-
factured.
Chapter III.
Nay, this is truth, though heart-strings break,
And jouih with gloomy brows bears :—
Howu'cr you try, you shall not make
Silk purses out of sows' ears.
W. Bracn. Soul-tatter:
In the present there is absolute redemption. Though a gulf should yawn,
go not you to sleep, but rub your eyes; be up and doing.—Jakes.
In the meantime, Sonooun's cousin, Acis Arrant, generally
known to his jocular intimates as Knave Arrant, had been living
in luxury with his cousin's weak mother, whom he had contrived to
marry. To effect this, however, he had been compelled to tear a
will into little pieces, and had, at the same time, ruined that peace
of his mind whioh he often gave to Sonogcn. The unfortunate
consequence was, that Sonogun did not value it in the least, and
always returned it to him. And thus the relations of the two men,
who should have been friends, the guardian and the ward, were
always on a hostile footing, which only the most delicate handling
c juld have healed. Acis was not happy. When his glass told him
he was old, he had no repartee ready, and could only speculate
gloomily on the disagreeable fate whioh had compelled him to take
part in a modern novel, and had evidently told him off to pass away
into the unseen in Chapter 40.
But, of course, Gladys and her father, the doctor, knew nothing

—~_. all this. Gusts always looked happy; her hair, her month,
her eyes, her ears, even her little unformed nose, all looked as happy
as possible. She was a pleasant little patent moraliser, with a double
escapement action for great occasions. On this evening all the
family was gathered together, inoluding the inevitable infant, whose
prattle serves to soothe the gloomy perversity of morose heroes. On
tuoh an evening as this Sonogun had seen them all years ago, and,
though he was standing in the garden and all the windows were
shut, he had heard every (ingle whisper of the family conversation.
The Doctor seemed to be troubled, and Gladys came up to him in
her caressing way.
"My dear," he said, simply, "Sonoguk is in trouble, and we
must rescue him." No more was said, but the next moment Gladts
and her father had left by the London express.
Chapter IV.
All things are fair that are not dark;
Tet all are dark that are not fair.
And the same eat that slaya the lark,
Itself is often killed by care.—Bo her.
Sonogtjw had seen a notice in a railway-carriage. "Beware of
card-sharpers " was printed upon it, and it flashed upon him, with
the foroe of a revelation, that it must be meant for him. Once more
he made up his mind. He would fly. Fear lent him a spare pair of
second-hand wings. He whistled to his dog Stray, and having
thrown Haeceel and Reitae out of the window, he napped twioe,
and then soared up, Stray following as best he could. It was very
dark, and the clouds were threatening. For a long time he avoided
them, but at length he fell into a particularly damp one, and would
inevitably have been drowned, had not the sagaoious Stray brought
men to his assistance. And thus Sonoguw, the sooffer, the agnostio,
the moody, gloomy, morose, oast-iron, Roman-faced misanthrope, got
home. That same evening he changed his clothes and his oharacter,
and on the following day married Gladts.

The fencing Leoture, entitled, The Story of Swordsmanship, seems

this offensive and
defensive subject
will be followed

theatres a lecture, the first of a series, on Pugilism and the Drama.

of his audience to what a ohange in the history of the Stage, nay,
perhaps, in the history of the world, would have occurred if to
Box's inquiry as to his pugilistio capacity, Cox had replied, "I can!"
and had there and then thrown himself, like Mr. Pickwick "into
a parolytio attitude," and exolaimed, "Come on!" an invi*
tation which the ohallenger would have been bound in honour to
acoept. The Lecturer will praotioally show how " to make a hit,"
and give an example from the life of the " early closing movement."
The Lecture will be interspersed with songs, such as Black Byes
and Blue Byes," "Hand and Glove," "Ring! Ring!" "The
Hymn to Floorer " a part-song, by four choristers, and "Me-fot-O's
song " from Faust. Perhaps the next Leoture on the same subjeot
will be given at The Umpire Theatre.

8HAKSPEARE AND THE UNMUSICAL GLASSES.
Ma. Fieero, in his letter to the D. T., complained that, should the
Music Halls obtain their wicked way, through the inoompetenoe of
the County Council to deal with the matter—(but is not Drdbio-
LASTJ8 a Counti-Counoiliarius, and ready to see justioe done to the
poor player, author, [and manager alike? Sure-ly!)—then a play
at a Hall of Musio (they used to be "Caves of Harmony in
Thackekat'b time, and the principal Hall of Music was Sam Hall)
will be heard between "a puff at a oigar and a sip from a glass."
Well, but what piece can get on without a puff or so? Would not
a good cigar during a good piece be an additional " drawP" We
have "Smoking Conoerts"; why not "Smoking Theatricals " P But
how about the Ladies f Years ago there were no smoking-carriages on
the Railways. And what nowadays is the proportion of smoking
to non-smoking compartments P Very small. The Ladies will
decide this question. But how about the Actors t In modern pieoes
they never lose an opportunity of smoking. Why shouldn't the oigar
be introduced into Shakspearian revivals P Anachronism to the
winds!—which is a polite way of expressing "Anachronism be
blowed!" 'Baccy be blowed too. Sir Walter Raleigh would have
approved its introduction in Elizabethan days. In Twelfth Night for
example, the line, "Help me
to some light," is suggestive;
so, also, in Macbeth—"Give
us a light, then"—out comes
the cigar. Titus Androni-
cus might be revived, with
a view to inaugurating the
innovation, and the line.
"Some of you shall smoke,"
would be the signal for
the production of many

Hamlet could, perhaps, find
some authority for reading
the line, "Will you play

[All from the Razzlb-Dazzle Agency.]
Hukiewaueie, February 28.
An extraordinary incident has :ust stirred tbe heart of this
populous Western centre to its depths. Some fifteen years ago
Colonel Zachaby B. Dibbs, one of the most prominent citizens of
Hakiewaukie (then a mere collection of log-huts), disappeared with-
out leaving any address to which his letters and papers were to be
forwarded. Mrs. Dibbs, who was then abont to give birth to the
seventh scion of the house of Dibbs, was inconsolable, and ordered
the fish-ponds in the vicinity to be subjected to a rigorous
sorutiny. All her conjugal efforts proved fruitless, the missing
Colonel was nowhere to be found, and, after a decent interval spent
in the wearing of widow's weeds, Mrs. Dibbs was led to the local
registrar's office by Sheriff's Deputy Orlando T. Struggles. Time
went on, and five flourishing Strugqlebes were added by the former
Mrs. Dibbs to the population of the town. On Thursday last, however,
Colonel Dibbs was discovered by his eldest son, Mr. Jerniah N.
Dibbs, the well-known notary public, sitting in his familiar seat in
the Fifth Street Saloon, drinking rum-shrub out of a tumbler. An
explanation followed. Sheriff's Deputy Struggles, in the hand-
somest manner, offered, to resign all claim to the possession of the
Colonel's spouse. The Colonel, however, would not hear of this.
Finally it was decided to spin a five-dollar green-back for the lady.
An inopportune gust of wind, however, carried off the fateful money,
and the momentous question is still undecided. The Colonel has
announced his intention of continuing a baohelor, even if he has to
fight the matter up to the Supreme Court, and a large majority of
the inhabitants of the town are willing to support him, with a view
to making this a test case. Munchausenviixe, March 2.
Yesterday, as one of the chief tiger-purveyors of this oity was
engaged in exercising his troupe of fiery, untamed tigers, in the
main street, two of the ferocious animals escaped from the string
which has usually been found sufficient for their confinement.
A general stampede of the inhabitants immediately followed, the
majority finding refuge in the bar of the recently constructed Hotel
Columbia. Mayor Maddebxey and his amiahle consort were, how-
ever, not so fortunate. The Mayor, being shortsighted, mistook the
two denizens of the jungle for a couple of performing poodles, to
whose training he had devoted much of his leisure, and who, as it
happened, were at that precise moment expected on their return
from the post-offioe, with the Mayor's mail in their mouths—a trick
which had often amused the Mayor's friends. Mr. Madderlby
advanced to stroke his supposed pets, and was much surprised to find
himself torn in pieces before he had time to send for the city mace.
Mrs. Maddibley, a stout, plethoric lady, would have been the next
victim, had she not, with extraordinary presence of mind, declared
herself dead the moment the animals approached her. This deceit
(which, however, has been the subject of grave censure in many
pulpits,) saved her life. Maddened by the taste of blood, the tigers
next attacked Mr. Labiat's grocery store. Here, however, they met
their match in an army of Gorgonzola cheeses, which broke from
their shelves, attacked the intruders with wonderful fury, and in
ten minutes had so far subdued them that their owner was able to
recapture them, and lead them home. The obsequies of Mr. Madder-
ley's shoes and his umbrella—all that was left of the unhappy Mayor
—have just taken place amidst universal demonstrations of sympathy.
The funeral cortege took an hour to pass a given point. Widow Mad-
debley proposes to sue the owner of her late husband's assassins.
Lynchville, March 3.
Two brothers, named respectively John and Thomas, quarrelled
here yesterday about the ownership of a clasp-knife. They drew
their revolvers at the same instant, and fired at a distance of two
paces. Strangely enough the two deadly bullets met in the air, and,
their force being exactly equal, they stopped dead and dropped to
the ground, whence they were afterwards picked up and presented
to the trustees of the Lynchville Museum of Fine Art. _ Nothing
daunted, the fraternal contestants set to work with their bowie-
knives, and were only separated after John had inflicted on Thomas
ten mortal wounds and received from him one less. It is generally
admitted that nothing could have been fairer than the conduct of
the police, who formed a cordon round the duellists, and thuB pre-
vented the fussy interference which has so often brought similar affairs
to a premature termination. The two coffins are to be of polished
walnut-wood, and will be provided by the Friendly Society to which
the two deceased belonged, as a last mark of affection and regard.

the .sort of man to retire in face of enemy. The only way to carry
out scheme recommended by Commissioners after prolonged inquiry
was to get rid of the Dook.
"I do trust," said Stanhope, winking at the Strangers' Gallery.
"that the publio will not interfere in this matter. They have had
the Report of the Commission in their hands for months. They
have taken no notioe of it, or any action upon it. I do hope, now
their attention has been called to the matter by my noble and
Radical friend opposite, they will not get up a fuss and insist that
necessary and important reforms in the Army shall not be indefinitely
postponed in order that the Dook may draw his salary and enjoy his
position. If the great mass of public opinion outside the Army
plainly declared their wishes in that direction, we should have to
yield; but, as I said before," and onoe more the Secretary furtively
dropped his left eyelid as he looked up at the Strangers' Gallery, "I
hope the publio will not change their attitude on this subject."
"That's all very well," said Laurie, who had now entered the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Reoommended appointment of Royal Commission on relations
between Labour and Capital. To uninstrnoted mind looks uncom-
monly like as if Ministers, reading: this speech on Monday morning,
had said to eaoh other, " Halloa! here 'a Randolph in the field again.
Says we mast have Labour Commission; suppose we must."
Nothing of the kind happened. Cabinet Council met at noon on
Saturday and decided upon Royal Commission. Grandolpii didn't
'peak for gome hours later. Odd that be should have hit on this
Commission busines; just like his general awkwardness of inter-
ference. Must prevent all possibility of mistake; so Old Morality,
in announcing Commission, innocently, but pointedly, stops by the
way to mention that Ministers had decided upon it "last Saturday."
Wish Grandolph had been here; would like to have Been the
winkle in his eye when he heard this little point made. But
GRandolph busy down by the Bocks, picking up his outfit. Secret
of the sudden and surprising growth of the beard out now. Grandolph
off to the gold-diggings, and beard usually worn there. Hardly knew
him when I looked in the other day at Connaught Plaoe; trying on
his new things; pair of rough unpolished boots ooming over his knees;
belt round his waist holding up his trousers and conveniently sus-
pending jacknife, tin pannikin, and water-bottle. "For use on the
voyage," he explains. Then a flannel shirt open at the neck ; a wide-
awake oooked on one side of his head; and a pickaxe on his shoulder.
"I'm tired of civilisation, Toby, and I am off to the diggins.
Leave you and Old Morality, and the Markiss and Jacoby
to look after politics. As for me, I'm going to look for gold.
I'm not rushing blindfold into the matter. I 've studied it with the
highest and the deepest authorities—and what do I learn P Native
gold is found crystallised in the forms of the octahedron, the cube,
and the dodecahedron, of which the cube is considered as the
primary form. It also occurs in filiform, capillary, and arborescent
shipes, as likewise in leaves or membranes, and rolled masses. It
offers no indications of internal structure, but, on being separated
by memanioal violence, exhibits a hackly fracture. Its colour com-
prises various shades of gold yellow. Its specific gravity varies from
11 8 to 19'2. It is oommonly alloyed by copper, silver, and iron, in
very small proportions. I mean, if I may say so, to unalloy it":
and, swinging the piok round his head with a dexterity that testified
to natural aptitude combined with diligent practice, Grandolph
chipped a fragment out of the marble mantelpiece, and, picking it
up. eagerly examined it, as if in search of a hackly fracture.
I wished him good luck, and went
baok to the House, where I found Bid
nui.ru smiling behind Speaker's chair,
watching Atkinson illustrating the work-
ing of his Duration of Speeches Bill by
ringing a muffin-bell, borrowed from a
Constituent.
Business done.—Miscellaneous.
Thursday.—Should have been at work
to-night on Army Estimates; but things
getting a little mixed. Nearly 150 Mem-
bers picknioking at Portsmouth; all the
Colonels, the Bo'suns, the Captains, and
the Admirals.
"Cipital opportunity to get on with
the Estimates, Jackson whispered in
Old Morality's ear.
"No," said that pink of chivalry, "I
will never take mean advantage of a
man. even of an Admiral. Let us put on
the Factories and Workshops Bill; won't
take long; keep us going till they get
back from Portsmouth."
So Home Skcrrtary moved Second
Reading. "Mere formality, you know,"
he explained; "shall refer Bill to Com-
mittee on Trade, and there it will be
thrashed out and shaped." But flood-
gates once opened not easily shut. The
Factories and Workshops mean the
Working-Man: Working-Man has Vote: .. „. , , ,, .„

Speeches by the dozen; Compton, after long sitting in patient
attitude at last oaught Speaker's eye. "A milk-and-water Bill,"
he scornfully characterised Home Secretary's measure.
"Ah! Compton knows what the Working-Man likes," said
Wilfrid Lawbon. "A rnm-and-milk Bill is more to his taste."
Lyon Playfatr delivered one of his luminous Lectures; full of
reference to " certifying surgeons," and "half-time children."
"What's a half-time child ?" I asked Campbkll-Bannrrmaw.
"Fancy it's one prematurely born," he whispered baok. "But
really don't know; not on in this scene; ask Mundella or
Lyon Play fair knew all about it and muoh else.


"Wonderful man!" said the Member for Sark, gazing admiringly
on his massive brow. "Always reminds me of what Sydney Smith
said about another eminent person. 'Look at my little friend 1st |
frey. He hasn't body enough to
cover his mind decently with. His
intellect is indecently exposed.'"
Business done. — Faotory and

Friday. — Provand brought on
Motion raising vexed question of
Taxation of Land. Old M orality
always on look-out to do kind thing;
thought this would be good oppor-
tunity of trotting out Chaplin;
had no chance of distinguishing
himself since he became Minister.
So Chaplin put up: made melli-
fluous speech. Unfortunately,
Mr. G. present; listened to Chap-
lin with suspicious suavity; fol-
lowed him, and, as Jkmmy Low
thee puts it, "turned him inside
out, and hung him up to dry."
Played with him like a eat with a
mouse; drew him out into damag-
ing statements; then danced on
his prostrate body. About the
worst quarter of an hour Chaplin
ever had in House, with .Tokkm on
one side of him, and Old Mora-
lity on other, tossing about on
their seats, exchanging groans and glances, while Chaplin mopped
the massive brow on which stood forth iridescent gleams of moisture.
"Meant it all for the best," said Old Morality; "but who'd
have thought of Mr. G. being here? Chaplin 'b a great Minister of
Agriculture; hut, when it comes to questions of finance, not quite
on a par with Mr. G." Butinett done.—House Counted Oat.
Waiting for Opportunity.
CHAMBERS IN ST. JAMES'S STREET.
Tut Idler, by Haddon Chambers, is a real good play, thoroughly
interesting from the rising to the setting of the Curtain. The parts are
artistically adjusted, the dialogue unforced, the acting un-stagey, and
the situations powerfully dramatic. The olimax is reaohed at the
"psychological moment," and the Curtain descends upon all that a
sympathetic audience can possibly desire to know of what must be onoe
and for all the story of a life-time. "The rest is silence." Through-
out the play there is no parade of false sentimentality, no tawdry
virtue, no copy-book morality, no vicious silliness; and, so well con-
structed is the plot, that there is no need of a wearisome extra Act,
by way of postscript, to tell us how all the characters met again at the
North Pole or Land's End; how everybody explained everything to
everybody else; how the Idler, becoming a busy-body, married the
widow of Sir John Harding, M. P., who had had the misfortune to be
drowned out shrimping; and how many other matters happened for
whioh the wearied audience would not care one f nap of the finger and
thumb. On another occasion I shall have something to say about the
acting, which, as far as the men are ooncemf d, has certainly not been
equalled since the days of Peril. The St. James's is in for a good
thing with The Idler; and at this moment I may say, I would be
Alexander were I not, briefly, Diogfnes "The Tubman," B.C.L.
Acting—on a Suggestion.— The Wotnan, always well informed,
tells us on February 26, that, "owing to numerous applications,"
Mr. C. T. Gukin is negotiating for the Royalty Theatre, in order to
give another Ibsenian performance. Now this is exactly what we
suggested in our number for February 14. If the date suits, we will
go and see Ghosts, and, if we succeed in keeping up our spirits after
seeing Ohotts, we will give a candid opinion on the performance of
the piece which hitherto we know only in print. En attendant, we
shall have something to say about the recent performance of that
pieoe of Ibsenity A Doll's House— in our next.
What's in a NamrP—On the recent occasion of the Queen's

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

"Tour Viritor ha« his Note-book out."
SPECIMENS FROM MR. PUNCH'S SCAMP-ALBUM.
No. III.—The Biographer.
Wi will ask you, reader, this week, to compel your fancy to take
a further flight, and kindly imagine yourself a worthy merchant,
who has exchanged the turmoil of City-life for the elegant leisure
of a suburban villa—let us say at Norwood. You are in your
dining-room, examining the sky, and thinking that, if the weather
holds up, you will take your hig dog out
presently for a run before lunch, when you
are told that a gentleman is in the study
who wishes to see you "on particular busi-
'The very word excites you, not
unpleasantly, nor do you
care whether it is Church-
warden's business, or the
District Board, or the County
Council—it is enough that
your experience and prac-
tical knowledge of affairs
are in request—and, better
still, it will give you some-
thing to do. So, after a
delay due to your own im-
portance, you maroh into
your study, and And a brisk
Btranger, with red whiskers
and a flexible mouth, ab-
sorbed in docu-
ments whioh he
has brought with
him in a black
hag.
"I have the
pleasure of ad-
dressing Mr.
Mask Lank,
I think?" he
says. "Just so. Well, Mr. Mark Lane, I consider myself
extremely fortunate in finding you at home, I assure you, and a
very charming place you have here—abundant evidence of a refined
and cultivated mind, excellent selection of our best-known writers,
everything, if I may say so, elegant in the extreme—as was to be
expected 1 Even from the cursory glimpse I have had, I can see
that your interior would lend itself admirably to picturesque des-
cription—whioh brings me to the objeot of my visit. I have called
upon you, Mr. Lane, in the hope of elioiting your sympathy and
patronage for a work I am now compiling—a work whioh will, I
am confident, commend itself to a gentleman of your wide culture
and interest in literary matters." (Sere you will look as judicial at
you can, and harden your heart in advance against a new Ency-
clopedia, or an illustrated edition of Shakspeare's works.) "The
work I allude to, Mr. Lane, is entitled, Notable Nonentities of
Norwood and its Neighbourhood" (Here you will nod gravely,
rather taken by the title.) "It will be published very shortly, by
subscription, Mr. Lane, in two handsome quarto volumes, got up
in the most sumptuous style. It is a work whioh has been long
wanted, and which, I venture to predict, will be very widely read.
It is my ambition to make it a complete biographical compendium
of every living celebrity of note residing at Norwood at the present
date. It will be embellished with copious illustrations, printed by
an entirely new prooess upon India and Japanese paper; everything
—type, ink, paper, binding, will be of the best procurable; the
publishers being determined to spare no expense in making it a
book of reference superior to anything of the kind previously
attempted!" (As he pauses for breath, you will take occasion to
observe, that no doubt such a work, as he contemplates, will bs an
excellent thing—but that, for your own part, you can dispense with
any information respecting the Notabilities of Norwood, and, m
short, that if he will excuse you )
"Pardon me, Mr. Lank," he interrupts, "you mistake my object.
I should not dream of expecting you to subscribe to suoh a work.
But, in my oapacity of compiler, I naturally desire to leave nothing
undone that care and research pan effect to render the work complete
— and it would be incomplete indeed, were it to inolude no reference
to so distinguished a resident as yourself!" (" Oh, pooh—nonsense.'"
You will say at this—but you will sit down again.) "Norwood is
a singularly favoured locality, Sir; its charms have induced many
of our foremost men to seleot it for their rus in urbe. Why, in
in this very road May I ask, by the way, if you are acquainted
with Alderman Mincing? Alderman Mincing has been good
enough to furnish me with many interesting details of his personal
career, a photo-gravured portrait of him will he included, with
views of the interior and exterior of 'The Druggeries,' and a bit
from the back-garden." (You do know Mincing—and you cannot
help inwardly wondering at the absurd vanity of the man—a mere
nobody, away from the City.') "Between ourselves," says your
interviewer, candidly, having possibly observed your expression,
"I am by no means sure that I shall feel warranted in allotting
Alderman Mincing as much space as I fear he will consider himself
entitled to. Alderman Mincing, though a highly respectable man,
does not appeal to the popular imagination as others I could mention
do—he is just a little commonplace!" (" Shrewd fellow, this!"
you think to yourself—" Got Mincing's measure!") "But I
should feel it an honour, indeed, if suoh a man as yourself, now,
would give me all the personal information you think proper to
make public, while, as a specimen of what Norwood can do in
luxurious and artistic domestic fittings, this house, Sir, would he
invaluable 1 I do trust that you will see your way to- "(At
first, you suggest that you must talk it over with your Wife—but you
presently see that if Mincing and men of that calibre are to be in
this, you cannot, for your own sake, hold aloof, and so your Visitor
soon has his note-book out.) "Any remarkable traits recorded of
you as an infant, Mr. Lane? A strong aversion to porridge, and
an antipathy to black-beetles—both of whioh you still retain?
Thank you, very much. And
you were educated? At Dul-
borough Grammar School? Just
so! Never took to Latin, or
learned Greek? Commercial
aptitudes deolaring themselves
thus early — curious, indeed!
Entered your father's office as
clerk? Became a partner?
Married your present lady—
when? In 1860? Exactly 1—
and have offspring? Your
subsequent life comparatively
uneventful? That will do ad-
mirably — infinitely obliged to
you, I am sure. It would be
useless to ask you if you would
care to have a copy of the work,
when issued, forwarded to you
—we can do it for you at the
very nominal sum of two
guineas, if paid in advanoe—
a gratifying possession for your
children after you have gone,
Mr. Lane! I
may put you
down? Thank
you. For two
oopies?" (On
second thoughts,
you do order two
copies: you can
send one out to
your married
Sister in Austra-
lia—it will amuse
her.) "One, two,
three, four gui-
neas— quite oor- ,,_ . .. „
reot, Mr. Lane, "You may bare to wait"
and you shall have an early opportunity of revising a proof, and we
will send down a competent artist, in a day or two, to take the pho-
tographs. Quite an agreeable change in the weather, is it not?
GWday!"
He is gone, leaving you to wait for the proof, and the photo-
grapher, and the appearance of that great work, Notable Nonentities
of Norwood,—end. it is not at all unlikely that you may have to
wait a considerable time.
Iago on the Great Sermon Question.
Good name in Mayor or Parson, dear my public,
Is the immediate jewel of their souls.
Who steals my sermon, steals trash ; 'tis something, nothing;
'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been mouthed by r1™ -
But he who " splits" on me as plagiarist,
Robs me of that which is no good to him,
And leaves me poor—in credit.

"Wherever we Wander," &c—A new book of advice for
intending Travellers has recently been published, entitled. " Where

THE FIRST ACT—AND THE LAST.
(A Departmental Tragi-Comedy, in active Rehearsal.)
Act I.— The Scene represents the Interior of a Military Instruction
Room. Black Boards, on which are displayed advanced
Problems and Calculations in the Higher Mathematics, and
various Scientific Charts cover the Walls. Models of mechanical
contrivances and machinery used in the construction of complicated
Small Arms approved by the Authorities, are scattered about
in every direction. Tommy Atkins w discovered, giving his best
attention to the conclusion of a very lengthy but rather abstruse
explanatory Lecture.
Military Instructor [who has been for an hour and a half ex-
plaining the intricate mechanism of the new Magazine Rifle,
finally approaching the end of his subject). Well, as I have fully
explained before, but may state once more, so as to firmly impress
it on your memory, you will bear in mind that the cylindrical
portion will be shortened in front, the end of the rib being provided
with tooth underneath, and stud on top, both studs on rib to have
undercut grooves, a small keeper-screw, and bolt-head for cover,
being added, while the cocking-stud is enlarged. Then do not
forget that jammed , cases or bullets are removed, by two ramrods,
screwed together by the locking-bolt being omitted. I needn't again
go over the twenty-four different screws, but, in case of accident, it
will be well to retain their various outside thread diameters in your
memory, specially not forgetting that those of the Butt Trap Spring,
the Dial Sight Pivot, and the Striker Keeper Screw, stand respectively
at '1696, '1656, and '116 of an inch. Of course you will remember
the seven pins, and that, if anything should go wrong with the Bolt
Head Cover Pin, as you will practically have to take the whole rifle
to pieces, you should, be thoroughly familiar with the 197 different
component items, which, properly adjusted one with the other, make
up the whole weapon. 1 think I need not refer again to the sight-
ing," seeing that the Lewes system is abolished, and that the
weapon is now sighted up to 3,500 yards, " dead on," no matter what
the wind may be. With tins remark, I have mnoh pleasure in
placing the rifle in your hands {gives him one), at the same time
advising you, if called upon to use it in the heat of action, to be pre-
pared with the knowledge I have endeavoured to impart to you to-
day, and, above all things, to keep your head cool. I don't think I
have anything more to add, Atkins. I have made myself pretty
dear?
Tommy Atkins {with a grin). 'Ees, Sir I
Military Instructor. And there is nothing more you wish to ask
me?
Tommy Atkins {still grinning). Noa, Sir I
Military Instructor. Ah 1 well then, good morning. I trust you
will find it, what they assure me'it is,—a most serviceable weapon.
Tommy Atkins {saluting). 'Ees, Sir!
[Exit, still grinning as Act-Drop descends.
Act II.—The Scene represents a Field of Battle {after the fight) in
the immediate neighbourhood of London. Tommy Atkins and
the Military Instructor discovered lying badly wounded amidst a
heap of the slain. A European War having broken out sud-
denly, from which the Country could not escape, and the Fleet
at the last moment, finding that it had only half its proper supply
of guns, and that the very few of these which did not burst at the
first shot had ammunition provided for them that was two sizes
too large, the Country is invaded, while a Committee of Experts
is still trying to settle on a suitable cartridge for the new Maga-
zine Rifle. The result is, that after a couple of pitched battles,
though in an outburst of popular fury, Mr. Stanhope is lynched
by the Mob to a lamp-post in Parliament Street, London
capitulates, and the French Commander-in-Chief, breakfasts,
waited on by the Lord Mayor, in the Bank of England.
Military Instructor {sitting up and rubbing his eyes). Dear me!
we seem to have been beaten. That Rifle was no good, after all.
{Recognising him.) Halloa, Atkins!
Tommy Atkins {with a grin). 'Ees, 8ir!
Military Instructor. You remember all I told you?
Tommy Atkins {still grinning). 'Ees, Sir!
Military Instructor. I'm afraid that wasn't such a serviceable
weapon, alter all I
Tommy Atkins {stillgrinning). Noa, Sir!
Military Instructor. Dear me I Well, we had better get out of
this! By Jove! it looks like the last Act!
[Mutually assist each other to rise and quit the Battle-field, the
Military Instructor threatening to write to the Times,"
and Tommy Atkins still grinning as Curtain falls.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Sir Edwin Arnold's paper on Japan, in Scribner, for March, is
interesting and also amusing. The Japanese seemed to be a charm-
ing people; and the Japanese women delightful as wives; but then
thev can be divorced for being talkative.
A propos of Japan, to judge from one of our Lira Joko's capital
illustrations of Hospital Nursing in The English Illustrated Magazine,
the Matron's room must be "an illigant place, intoirely "; while as
for amusement, if the picture of a nurse giving a patient a cup of
ink by mistake for liquorice-water isn't a real gcoa practical side-
splitter, the Baron would like to be informed what is P Then we come
upon a delightful little pioture of '1 The Pet of the Hospital"; and so
she ought to be, for a prettier pet than this nursing Sister it would
be difficult to find. What becomes of herP Does she marry a
"Sawbones," or run off with a patient P Anyhow, she must be a
"great attraction," and if anything were to happen to the Baron, and
he couldn't be removed to his own palatial residence, he would say,
"Put me in a oab, drive me to the Furniss Hospital, and let me be
in Pretty Pet's Ward."
The Baron has just been dipping into Mr. Justin Huntly
M'Cakthy's "Pages on Plays' in The Oentleman's Magazine.
Justin Huntly expresses his opinion that " The Dancing Girl will
almost certainly be the play of the season; it will probably be the
principal play of the year." "Almost oertainly " and "probably"
save the situation. The Baron backs The Idler against The Dancing
Girl for a run. In the same Magazine Mr. Albert Fleming has
condensed into a short story, called Sally, material that would have
served some authors for a three-volume novel.
It is a pleasure for the Baron to be in perfeot aocord on any one
point with the Author of Essays in Little, and in proportion to the
number of the points so is the Baron's pleasure intensified. Moet in-
tending readers of these Essays, on taking up the book, would be less
curious to ascertain what Andrew I.a no has to say about Homer and
the study of Greek, about Th£odore db Banville, Thomas Haynes
Baylsy, the Sagas, and even about Eingsley, than to read his opinions
on Dickens and Thackeray, placing Dickens first as being the more
popular. The Baron recommends his friends, then, to read these
Essays of Andrew's, beginning with Thackeray, then Dickens; do
not, on any account, omit the delightfully written and truly appre-
ciative article on Charlbs Lever; after whioh, go as you please,
but finish with " the last fashionable novel," wherein our M.A., in
his Merriest-Andrewest mood, treats us to an excellent parody.
The Baron has appointed an extra Reader, and this Extra-
Ordinary Reader to the Baron has just entered upon the discharge
of his duties by reading Monte Carlo, and Mow to Do It, by
W. F. Goldberg, and G. Chaplin Pibsse (J. W. Ahrowsmtth).
He reports in the following terms to his loved Chief: —This book
achieves the task of combining extraordinary vulgarity with the
flattest and most insipid dulness— not a common dulness, but
a dulness redolent of low slang and dirty tap-rooms. The authors
seem to plume themselves on their marvellous success in reaching
Monte Carlo, whioh, with their usual sprightly faoetiousness,
they call "Charley's Mount." They are good enough to tell
such of the travelling public as may want to get there, that the
train leaving Victoria at 8'40 a.m. reaches Dover at 10•:).">. Stu-
pendous! These two greenhorns took their snack on board the
steamer (Ugh!), instead of waiting until they reaohed Calais, where
there is the best restaurant on any known line. Instead of going by
the Ceinture, they drove across Paris. The greenhorns arrive at
Monte Carlo, and then settle on their quarters. Anyone but an idiot
would have settled all this, and muoh more, beforehand. One gentle-
manly greenhorn, who wishes us to think that "il connait son
Paris," talks of "suppers of Bignon's" (which must be some
entirely new dish), and informs us that, "at the Hotel de l'Athenee,
the btaff esteem it rather a privilege, and a mark of their skill in
language, to grin and snigger when sworn at in English." Oh,
sweet and swearing British greenhorn! now I know why the French
so greatly love our countrymen. But why, oh why do you imagine
that you have discovered Monte Carlo P For the details of the
journey, and the instructions to future explorers, are set out with
a painful minuteness which not even Stanley could rival. As for
Monaco, dear, restful, old-fashioned, pioturesque Monaco, whither
the visitor climbs to escape from the glare and noise of Monte
Carlo, the greenhorn dismisses it scornfully, as having "no inte-
rest." How muoh does this ten-per-oenter want? He "waggles
along the Condamine;" he mixes with many who are "pebble-
beached;" he speaks of his intimates as "Pa," "The Coal-
Shunter," " Baliyhooly," &o., and declares of the French soldier
that "the short service forty-eight-day men don't have a very
unkyperdoodlum time of it." There's wit for you, there's elegance I
Then he becomes Jeromeky-jeromistioally eloquent on the subject
of fleas, throws in such lucid expressions as "chin music," "gives
him biff," "his graft is thusly," and, altogether, proves himself
and his fellow-explorer to be a couple of the slangiest and most
foolish greenhorns who ever put pen to any sort of paper. I can
imagine the readers who enjoy their stuff. Dull, swaggering,
blatant, gin-absorbing, red-faced Cockneys, who masquerade as
sportsmen, and chatter oaths all day. "Ditto to you," says the
Baron to his Extra-Ordinary Reader, and backs bis opinion with his
signature, The Baron db Book-Worms.

MORE IBSENITY!
Dkak Eiutok,—Noticing that the author of The DolPt House was
to have another morning, or, to use an equally suitable epithet,
mourning performance devoted to his works, I made up my mind,
after bracing up my nerves, to attend it.
The 23rd of February (the date of the
proposed function) as the second Monday
in Lent, seemed to me, too, distinctly
appropriate. By attending the perform-
ance—Ibsen recommends self-execution
—I sentenced myself to three hours and
a half of boredom, tempered with dis-
gust. I cannot help feeling that what-
ever my past may have been, the penance
paid to wipe it out was excessive, and
therefore rendered it unnecessary that I
should attend a second performance an-
nounced for last week.
Rotmertholm is in four Acts and one
Scene—a room in Rosmer's House. Aotl.
Rector Krolt, who is the brother-in-law of Pastor Rosmer, calls] upon
the latter, to ask him to edit a paper in the Conservative interest.
Kroli (who, by the way, is a married man) before seeing the widower
of his dead sister, has a mild flirtation with Rebecca West, a f emale
of a certain age, who has taken up her abode for some yean in the
Rector's house. And here I may observe that the Rector's house-
keeper, Madame Helteth, presumably a highly respectable person,
although she has excellent reasons, from the first, for believing that
the relations between her Master and Rebecca are scarcely platonio,
Accepts the domestic arrangements of the Rosmer menage with hearty
acquiescence, not to say enthusiasm, Rosmer interrupts the Rector's
tete-a-tete with the [fascinating Rebecca, and declines the proffered
editorship, because he is a Radical, and an atheist. >End of
Act I.,—no aotion to speak of, but a good deal of wordy twaddle. In
Act II. we learn that the late Mrs. Rosmer has committed suicide,
because she was informed that the apostate Pastor could only save
his villainy from exposure by giving immediately the position of wife
to her friend Rebecca. She has had this tip on the most reliable autho-
rity,—it has been furnished by Rebecca herself. Then the Pastor asks
Rebecca to marry him, but is refused, for no apparent reason, un-
less it be that she has tired of her guilty passion. In Act III.
Rebecca admits to the widower and his brother-in-law that she has
deceived the deceased, and prepares to decamp. In the final Act
the apostate Pastor declares that he has been in love with Rebecca
from the iirst, loves her now, but is not sure that she loves him.
To set his mind at rest on this point, will she do him a small
favour P Will she be so good as to jump into the mill-stream, and
drown herself? With pleasure—and she takes a header! He explains
that courtesy forbids him to keep a lady waiting, and follows her
example I So both are drowned, and'all ends happily!
Ana this is the plot I And what about the characters P Rebecca
is merely a hysterical old maid, who would have been set right,
in the time of the Tudors, with a sound ducking; and nowadays,
had she consulted a fashionable physician, she would have been
probably ordered a sea-voyage, and a diet free from stimulants. The
Pastor is a feeble, fickle fool, who seemingly has had but one
sensible idea in bis life. He has believed his wife to be mad, and.
considering that she married him, his faith in the matter rested
upon evidence of an entirely convincing nature. The Rector Kroli
is a prig and a bore of the first water. When he discovers Rebecca's
perfidy, he suggests that she may have inherited her proneness for
treachery from her father—and, to her distressed astonishment, he
gives the name of a gentleman, not hitherto recognised by her as a
parent! The best line in the piece, to my mind—and it certainly
"went with a roar "—iB a question of the housekeeper—answered in
the negative—"Have you ever seen the Pastor laugh?" Laugh!
with such surroundings! Pretentious twaddle, that would .be
repulsively immoral were it less' idiotic. And so dull!
As a theatre-goer for more than a quarter of a century, I dislike
undue severity, and am consequently glad to find my opinion is
shared by others. "Scrutator," the Dramatic Critic of Truth,
wrote last week—" The few independent persons who have sat out a
play by Ibsen, be it The Doll's House, or The Pillars of Society, or
Rotmertholm, have said to themselves, 'Put this stuff before the
playgoing public, risk it at an evening theatre, remove your claque,
exhaust your attendance of the socialist and the sexless, and then
see where your I bsrn will be.' I have never known an audience
that oared to pay to be bored, and the over-vaunted Rotmertholm
bored even the Ibsenites." I only hope it did, for they deserve their
martyrdom! I believe that you personally, my dear Editor, have
never seen a dramatic performance of the "Master's" work. I wish
I could say as muoh, and I shall be surprised if you do not appre-
ciate the feeling, after you too have partaken of this truly Lenten
fare. Tours sincerely,
One who likes Ibsen—at a Distance.
STRIKING TIMES.
New Version of an Old Street Ballad,
(By a Labouring Elector.)
Cheek up, cheer up, you sons of toil, and listen to my song.
The times should muoh amuse you; you are up, and going strong.
The Working Men of England at length begin to see
That their parsnips for to butter now the Parties all agree.
Chorus.
It 't high time that the Working Men should have it their own way,
And their protpect of obtaining it grows brighter every day!
This is the time for striking, lads; at least, it strikes me so.
Monopoly has had some knocks, and under it must go.
Norwood we licked; Livesey licked us; his was an artful plan;
But luck now turns. Ask Johnny Burns, and also Tommy
Mann!
Chorus—It's high time, &o.
It isn't "Agitators'" now, but Parties and M.P.'s,
Who swear we ought to have our way, and do as we darn please.
Upon my word it's proper fun! A man should love his neighbour;
Yet WhigsJhate Tories, Tories Whigs; but oh! they all love
Labour 1
Chorus—It's high time, &o.
There's artful Joey Chambeblaxn, he looks as hard as nails,
But when he wants to butter ut, the Dorset never fails;
He lays it on so soft and slab, not to say thick and messy.
He couldn't flummerify us more were each of us a Jesse I
Chorut—It's high time, &o.
Then roystering Random; takes his turn; hit treacle's pretty thick;
He gives the Tories the straight tip,—and don't they take it—quick?
And now, by Jove, it's comical!—where will the fashion end ?—
There's Pa knell ups and poses as the genuine Labourer's Friend!
Chorut—It's high time, &o.
Comrades, it makes me chortle. The Election's drawing nigh,
And Eight Hours' BiUs, or anything, they '11 promite for to try.
They '11 spout and start Commissions; but, 0 mighty Labouring Host.
Mind your eye, and keep it on them, or they '11 have you all on toast 1
Chorut.
It't high time that the Working Men thould have it their own way.
They'll t'.rain their throatt,—you mind your rotes, and you may
find it pay.'
WILDE FLOWERS.
Some other fellow, in the P. M. O., has been beforehand with us
in spotting "A Preface to Dorian Gray," by our Oscak WiLDE-r
than ever, in this month's fortnightly. Dorian Gray was published
some considerable time ago, so it belongs to ancient history, and
now, after this lapse of time, out comes the preface. And this
"preface" occupies the better part, I use this expression in all
courtesy, of two pages; which two pages represent a literary flower-
bed, where rows of bright asterisks are planted between lines of
brilliant aphorisms. The rule of the arrangement seems to be,—
"when in doubt, plant asterisks." Sic itur ad astra. The garden
is open to all, let us cull) here one and there one. I" To reveal Art
and conceal the Artist, is Art's aim." Is there not in this the scent
of "Ars est celare artem" t "Art" includes "the Artist," of
course. Then "Purit omnia pura" is to be found in two other
full-blown aphorisms, if I mistake not. St. Paul]s advice to
Timothy is engrafted on to the stalk of another aphorism. "Why
lug in Timothy?" Well, to " adapt" Scripture to one's purpose is
not to quote it. Vade retro! Do we not recognise something familiar
in " When Critics disagree the Artist is in accord with himself t"
But after it is all done, and the little flower-show is oyer, then
arises the despairing cry of our own oherished Oscak. It is in the
Last of the Aphorisms; after which, exhausted, he can only sign his
name, fling away the goose-quill, and then sink back in his luxurious
arm-chair exhausted with the mental efforts of years concentrated
into the work of one short hour. Ah!" La plupart det lu res d'd
present ont Toir d'avoir (tf faitt en un jour avec del livret lut de
la veille." Ask Messrs. Rochefoucauld, Champort, Rtvarol, and
JeanMorle. "Ai! Ai! Papai! Papai! Phillaloo! Murther
in Irish!" Let us he natural, or shut up shop. Yet there is a
chance,—to be supernatural. The great Pan is dead, so there is
seat vacant among the gods, open to any aspirant for immortality.
"All Art it quite useless!" cries Oscak Wru>K-ly. And has it
come to this? "Is this the Hend?" Yes, this is his last word—
for the present Pan is dead! Vive Pannikin!

Affection admiringly eyes them:—

Or is it that in such a habitation,
Herself a spinster more at home might feel;
And in a Spinning House find occupation,
Provided with a decent spinning-wheel;
But there,—no matter whence it oame,
Or what's the meaning hidden in its name,
About its destination there's no fear;
And judging from a noted recent case,
The Spinning House will,—it is pretty dear,—
Itself be soon sent spinning into space.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A WILD WELCOME.
February's reign of gloom
Out of mind and eight is,
Noonday darkness of the tomb,
Carbon and bronchitis.
Though the air is keen and chill,
Cloudy though the skies are,
Buoyant breaths our bosoms fill,
Free from smart our eyes are.
Bursting on the lengthening day
Bellows March the Viking,
"I have blown the fogs away;
Is this to your liking?"
Yes, thy voice o'er moor and mead
Sets the spirits bounding,
Like the Major's chartered steed
At the trumpet's sounding.
Welcome, roaring moon of dust,
Welcome, Spring's reviver;
On the race again we must
Risk the wonted fiver;
Fields are showing brighter/green,
Early buds are shooting;
On the early youth is seen
The new season's suiting.
Long it is since sparrows shrill
With their chirping woke us;
There is one with busy bill
Worrying a crocus.
How they love the flow'r of spring—
Never can resist it;
What a graceful little thing—
Bother, I have miss'd it 1
Now the wind along the plain
Comes with roar and clatter—
There, my hat is off again!
Let it go—no matter.
What am I, to say thee nay
In thy rudest phases?
Blow my Sunday hat away,
Blow my hat to blazes.
'lis but little we can do
For thy bounty's measure—
Sacrifice a hat or two P
Forty hats, with pleasure.
KENSINCTON GARDENS SMALL TALK.
From the Railway Improvement Phrase-Book.
Thai Nursery-maid with the three ohildren
and the perambulator will certainly get run
over by the train if she stands there gossiping
with the man in the signal-box.
That is the nineteenth horse that has run
away and thrown its rider this morning,
frightened by the smoke of the passing engine.
So it is not, after all, a tornado that has
swept across the Gardens, and rooted up all
these trees, bat merely the firm that has taken
the contract for the making of the new line.
Yes, there is no doubt that this wooden
fence, stretching right across the Gardens,
relieved by overseers' moveable hatch-houses,
puffing steam-cranes, and processions of mud-
carts, rather interfere with the beauty and
tranquillity of the place, but one must really
bear in mind that it is, after all, only to last
for Ave years.
Ha! 1 thought so I There go the whole of
the water-fowl under that luggage-train.
It is true, the Gardens are ruined, but one
must not forget the inestimable advantage

MEN WHO HAVE TAKEN ME IN-
TO DINNEB,
(By a Dinner-Belle.)
No. II.—Don Juan Senior.
To share with men the prandial gloom
Of union forced that ratal custom
Decrees to wither " youth and bloom,"
(The phrase is from Sohrab and Rustum)
I've suffered boredom to the full;
Professors dull—of Hindostani!
Da 11 wits, dull statesmen, dandies dull—
He wasn't dull—was Don Giovanni.
A widower feted far and wide,
The jauntiest Bake who drinks the waters,
Smartest of " smart" vulgarians, pride
And terror of his decent daughters;
Old Don Giovanni, fraught with warm
Flirtations, free to fling his cash on
The dining Duchess, "mould of form!"
Antique, good-looking " glass of fashion."

He gossiped how the Viscount bets
(Some heiress he must really "pick up "),
How noble dames smoke cigarettes
And noble heels in ballets kick up.
How " H.R.H." n 'importe ! my friend
Experience shows me that the laches
Of such as air these letters tend
In the direction of their " H"'s.
He chatted next of German Spas,
Of Continental, English "P.B.'s,"
And how our matchmaking Mammas
Are soared by Transatlantic Hebes,
How he with Royalties had graced
The latest function—genial patrons—
While Beauty, perched on barrows, raced
Before the virtuous British matrons.
And then his compliments began
To rain like drops of Frangipanni,
A most insinuating man
He was, this ancient Don Giovanni.
You felt, if yon could half believe,
You'd but to word a whim to find it,
You quite forgot he owned a sleeve,
And several teeth to laugh behind it.
There may be kindness, lofty souls,
Great Brains, and what so ne'er grows older,
Him the Material controls:
He shrugs a sleek, good-natured shoulder.
Time scatters dalliance, joy, and joke;
Your choicest vintage passes; e'en your
Supreme tobacco ends in smoke—
And so will poor Don Juan, Senior.
Mrs. Malafrof is much puzzled at the

SONGS BY A CYNIC.
Lots.
What 's Love, and all that Love can bring,
Youth's earliest illusion:
What tender words she used to sing,
And blush with sweet confusion.
How you would hang upon each word,
When under spells of Cupid;
When half she said was most absurd,
And all extremely stupid.
Yon loved her for her hair of gold,
Unwitting that she dyed it;
She vowed her love could ne'er grow cold,
Though Time had never tried it.
Your worship came to such a pass,
That, when you calmly view it,
You feel you were an utter ass,
Though then you never knew it.
What happened? Why, the usual thing:
While round her you would linger,
Her love was fragile as the ring
You bought to grace her finger.
She went off with another man,
And so you had to sever:
Thus women since the world began
Have done, and will do ever.
REVELATIONS OF A REVELLER.
I revelled at the Albert Hall, which last
week was given up to a festival called " The
Coming Race." I was there at the open-
ing on Thursday, the 5th, when Princess
Beatrice, attended by her husband, Prince
Henry of Battenberg, declared the Bazaar
open. A gay and festive scene. Here, there,
and everywhere, Egyptian houses made of
cardboard, containing stalls full of the most
useful articles imaginable. On the dais, a
number of sweet-faced ladies presenting
purses (containing £3 3s. and upwards) to the
Princess, who received them with an affa-
bility which won the hearts of all beholders.
On the floor of the building was a gaily-
dressed throng, which included many a dis-
tinguished person. The revelry continued for
three days, and was, I trust, the means of
obtaining funds for a charity which, no
doubt, is most deserving of support. And
here, I may say, I revelled so much "at the
Albert Hall, that I had no desire to revel
anywhere else.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTBACTED FEOM THE DIAEY OF TOBY, M.P.
Home of Common*, Monday, March 2.— Navy Estimates on
to-night. Millions of money to be voted, and only fourteen Members
present. One, it is true, is Habcoubt; so perhaps the most accurate
enumeration of the aggregate would be fifteen.
"Que diable allait-U faire dam c» jolly-boat?" George Hamilton
asks, pausing for a moment in his inoessant occupation of tearing up
strips of paper to glance across table at portly figure reclining on
Front Opposition Bench. Several Admirals and Captains have
spoken. Members generally have fled the burning deck. Even Old
Moraliti's sense of duty to his Queen and Country cannot restrain
his flight; but Casablanca Habcoubt still
remains. A little provoking for the Old
Salts descanting on Naval affairs to observe
smile of pitying toleration with whioh he
listens. Doesn't say they 're all wrong, but
smiles it. Even the voice of the Reverbera-
ting Colomb falters when, glancing round
the great gaps of empty Benches opposite, his
eye falls on Habcoubt.
"Sir, I repeat," he said, quite angrily,
though no one had oontradioted him, that
during the period that has elapsed since com-
mencement of the present reign, the revenue
of the United Kingdom has increased only
one-and-a-half times, while that of the out-
lying Empire has multiplied five-fold."
General admission that Habcoubt is a
master in nearly every department of human
knowledge. Up to to-night fondly thought
that at least he knew nothing about the
Navy. But he does; knows more than Ad-
miral Field, or Admiral Matne, or even
Colonel Gourlkt. Presently rose and deli-
vered slashing speech, laying low the Rever-
berating Colomb as if he had been set up
in the Place Vendome; reviewing the British
Fleet in masterly style; nimbly running up
the mainmast and sighting Jerusalem and
Madagascar, to the absolute confounding of
the First Lord of the Admiralty.
"Well," said Kebans, drawing himself B
up to something more than his full height. Something ha
"that's the most remarkable exhibition I
I ever heard, even from Habcoubt. We've nothing like it on our side.

Howobth knows a thing or two, and IIanbury isn't lacking in
accomplishment; but for versatility, for profundity of knowledge,
for readiness of grasp, whether the object be a lawyer's brief, a
Chancellor of the Exchequer's ledger, the hilt of a sword, or the
tiller of a ship, give me Habcoubt."
Business done.—Committee on the Navy Estimates.
Tuesday.—Wolmbb asked Old Morality what about the Fog?
Couldn't something be done to lighten it, say by appointment of
Royal Commission? Old Morality beamed across House upon
his young friend with expression of almost paternal solicitude.
Wolmrb is Whip of the allied force. What did he mean by
suddenly springing this question on the First Lord of the Treasury?
Was there more in it than met the eye? Had it something to do,
however obsourely, with the maintenance of the Union f _
Chambbblain sat on the Front Bench opposite, staring straight
into space with Sphynx-like countenance. Habtington, with hat
cunningly tipped over eyes, hid what secret may have Iain far in
their pellucid depths. Henry James became suddenly absorbed in
the brown gaiters he has recently added to the graces of his personal
appearance, in pathetic admission that the natural charms of youth
are at length fading.
Nothing to be gained by the inspection. If the cause of the
Union really was at stake, the springs of motive were hidden behind
the smiling countenance of the Machiavellian Wolmf.r. The only
thing to do, and it is quite foreign to the habits of Old Morality,
was to meet guile with guile. Wolmkb's question, plain enough as
it appeared in print on the prosaic Orders, was, "Will Her Majesty's
Ministers consider the advisability of appointing a Royal Commission
to examine and report how far the evil of Fog is one that may be
mitigated by legislation?"
"Sir," said Old Morality, rising to the occasion, "I have to
assure my Noble Friend that Her Majesty's Government are, in
common with other inhabitants of the Metropolis, extremely sensible
of the serious injury, disturbance, and hardship inflicted by the
creasing prevalence of fog. What, it may be asked, is the cause
of the London fog? These fogs, which occur generally in the
winter time, are occasioned thus: some current of air, being sud-
denly cooled, descends into the warm streets, forcing baok the smoke
in a mass towards the earth. But, my Noble Friend might ask, why
are there not fogs every night? I will tell him, for this is a matter
in whioh Her Majesty's Government have nothing to hide, or. I may
add, to conceal. Our wish is to meet the convenience of Hon. Gentle-
men in whatever part of the House they sit. Fogs—this I have no
hesitation in stating—do not supervene without intermission on
successive nights, because the air will always hold in solution a
certain quantity of vapour whioh varies aocording to its temperature,
and when the air is not saturated, it may be cooled without parting
with its vapour. Yes, I know. My Right Hon. Friend, the Member

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[Mahch 14, 1891.

for West Birmingham, with his usual acumen—whioh I am sure we
all recognise—asks me, In what circumstances do fogs occur at
night? 1 am much obliged to him for reminding me of the point.
Fogs happen at night, when the air has been satu-
rated with vapour during the day. When this is
the case, it deposits some of its superabundant
moisture in the form known in rural distriots—as
my Hon. Friend, the Member for the Bordesley
Division, is well aware—as dew. In the Metropolis
it is more familiar as fog. This process of deposi-
tion commences as soon as the capacity of the air
for holding vapour is lessened by the ooldness of
advancing night. I think I have
now answered the question of my
Noble Friend fully, and, I trust,
frankly. He will, I am sure, upon
consideration, see that this is not
a matter with which a Royal Com-
mission could be expected success-
fully to cope, and, therefore, I
may add, Her Majesty's Govern-
ment do not, after full considera-
tion of their duty to the Queen
and Country, think it desirable to
adopt the suggestion thrown out
by my Noble Friend."
Bramston Beach's face during
this subtle discourse a study;
Feeling his Way through the Fog. remained very quiet for rest of
sitting; told me at ten minutes to eleven he thought he was
beginning to grasp Old Moralitt's meaning. "Yes," he added,
with more cheerfulness, " I'm feeling my way through the fog."
Business done.—Stansfeld's Franohise Resolution negatived by
291 Votes against 189.
Thursday.—In Lords to-night, three white figures fluttered down
gently on to red Benches, like virgin flakes of snow. But, unlike
snow, they didn't melt. On close examination, turned out to be three
new Bishops; two of them old friends, with new titles.
"Like Bottom, translated," Bramwell growls.
Dr. Magee, walking out Bishop of Peterborough, comes back Arch-
bishop of York. The ceremony of their installation not nearly so
comic as that of ordinary Peers of Parliament. Garter King-at-
Arms does not appear; nor Black Rod; nor is there any game of
Follow-my-leader round the Benches.
"No, no," said the Marxiss, who Mr. G. quite unjustly says has
no strain of reverenoe in his disposition, "that would never do.
Mnst be careful with our Bishops."
So the three new-comers, having paid their respects to the Lord-
Chancellor, straightway
took their seats on the
Episcopal Bench, folded
their hands over their sur-
pliced knees, and lent an
added air of peace and
purity to the precincts.

between two estates of the realm, might work great things. But
I'm beginning to lose confidence in him. At certain periods of the

Business done.—Navy Estimates in Commons.
Friday.—Philippe Eoalite very rarely troubles House with
ordered speech. A good deal on his mind looking after JACOiiy,
and keeping the Party straight. But his silence doesn't arise from
incapacity to speak. This shown to-night in his speech on Railway

Rates and Charges. Full of good matter, admirably delivered.
After this, Dr. Clark proposed to discuss Home Rule; but House
didn't stem to care about it particularly. So at Half-past Eight

THE FINE YOUNG GERMAN EMPEROR.
(A New Song to an Old Tutu.)
I'll sing to you a brand new song, made by a modern pate,
Of a fine young German Emperor, an Oracle of State,
Who kept up his autocracy at the bountiful old rate,
With the aid of Socialism for the poor men at his gate;
This fine young German Emperor, all of the modern time.
His ancestors had " kept their fingers on the pulse of time"
(He said), and he'd do ditto in a fashion more sublime;
For, as Bacon said of Nature, he who'd rule her must obey.
And that with modern " tendency," is the new imperial way,
Of this fine young German Emperor, &c.
He'd " mastered the new Spirit," whioh (how kind!) "he'd not
Social reform or Eduoation he'd not treat as foes, [oppose."
But keep step with the "Tendencies" whioh else might trip his
toes,
And thus he'd "head the movement," and would lead it (by the
This fine young German Emperor, &o. [nose P),
Now surely this is better far than all the old parade
Of tyranny in mufti, and of greed in masquerade;
And of this young German Emperor, whatever may be said,
Or of his new vagaries, you '11 allow he knows his trade,
Does this fine young German Emperor, &o.
There were some who did not like it,—there are always such, one
knows,
Who Ancient Order patronise, and Modern Style oppose.
Particularly one Old Man, who plainly did not see
Laying down his long held power, and submitting tranquilly
To this fine young German Emperor, &o.
He was no Cincinnatus, and he did not love the plough,
So he talked, inspired the Papers, and, in fact, roused lots of row.
For this man of Blood and Iron, when thus laid upon the shelf,
Found that long control of others did not mean control of Belf,
Or this fine young German Emperor, &o.
Then this fine young German Emperor, who aims to lead the dance,
Has a very trying vis-a-vis, that fractious dame, La France,
To keep step with that lady, without treading on her train,
Would tax Terpsichore herself; he finds the effort vain;
Does this fine young German Emperor, &o.
So this fine young German Emperor has got a stiffish task,
That all his strength will occupy, and all his tact will task.
Let us wish him patriot wisdom, and respeot for Elder Fame,
And then he '11 give his country peaoe, and leave a noble name,
This fine young German Emperor, all of the modern time!
A ROUGH CROSSING.
That military-looking gentleman, with his arm in a sling, and his
head covered with bandages, has, I suppose, just returned from
fighting the Dacoits in Upper Burmah P
I certainly am surprised when you inform me that he has only
tried to cross a London street in a fog.
Do you really mean to say that the vehicle that just thundered
past at twenty miles an hour, in the mist, was not a hre-engine, but
only a covered Van P
Yes, I believe it is a fact that specialjbedsjin all the Hospitals are
now reserved for Van-victims.
Of course it is difficult for a man in the Van to look to the Rear;
still he need not swoop down on pedestrians quite so much like a
highwayman, saying, Your collar-bone or your life!"
If things go on as they are now doing, every covered Van will
have to carry its own Surgeon and ambulance about with it.
What is that crowd for, and why is somebody shouting angrily P
Oh, I suppose the old gentleman, who has been run over by the
Coal-waggon and is lying bleeding on the asphalte, is remonstrating
with the driver?
What? Can it really be the case that the driver is abusing the
old gentleman for his stupidity in getting in his way?
I have heard that the Insuranoe Companies now insert in their
policies a condition forbidding the orossing of any street in London,
exoept under police esoort.
And, finally, as nearly six thousand persons were run down in
the streets of the Capital last year, is it not almost time that"
thing were done to oheok the Van Mazeppa-Juggernaut
career?

KENSINGTON CORRESPONDENCE.
i.
Instead of the Sub-Kensington Gardens Railway scheme as
proposed, why not a Sub-Serpentine Line P Start it from the South
Kensington Sta-
tion, Distriot-
cum - Metropoli-
tan system, run
it with one station
well-under-
ground in the
middle of Exhi-
bition Road,
whence an easy
ascent to the Im-
perial Exhibition,
when passengers
would come up
to "carp the vital
airs," then right
away again,
branching off left and right, thus bringing the mild Southerners
into rapid, easy communication, at all reasonable hours, and
at reasonable prices, with the rugged denizens of the Northern
districts, East and West. If Kensington Gardens are to be touched
at all—and, not being sacred groves, there is no reason why they
should not be, faute de mieux—a transverse tunnelling from Ken-
sington High Street to Queen's Road would do the trick. We will
be happy to render any assistance in our power, and are,—Yours
truly, Will Honeycomb, Molb, Fkrrkt & Co.,
(Burrow-Knights.)
n.
0 Sib,—Pleese don't let us ave no nasty railwaies and tunels in
Kinsinton Gardins, were we now are so skludid, and the ohildern
can play about, an no danger from nothink sep dogs, wioh is mosley
musseled, or led with a string, an we ain't trubbled about them, an
can ave a word to say to a f rend, or a ouzzin, you unnerstan, unner
the tree sea, so nice an quite, wioh it wold not be wen disterbd by
in gins, an smoke, skreeges, an steem-wizzels. 0, Mr. P., don't let
um do it. Yours obeegentlee, Saha Jane,
(Unner Nurtrymade.)
m.
Sib,—The Railway underneath Kensington Gardens won't be
noticed if only taken down deep enough below the surface. No
blow-holes, of course. No disfigurement. Take it under the centre
path, where there are no treei, then turn to the left outside the gate
and burrow away to 8. Kensington Station. I can then get across
the park in three minutes for a penny; and now I have to walk,
for which I haven't the time, or take a cab, for which I haven't the
money. Yours, A Practical Paupee.
IT.
Sib,—I take this opportunity of pointing out that if anything at
all is to be done with Kensington Gardens, why not make a real
good Rotten Row there t That would be a blessing and a con-
venience. We're all so sick and tired of that squirrel-in-a-cage
ride, round and round Hyde Park, and that half-and-half affair in
St James's Park. No, Sir; now's the time, and now's the honr.
There's plenty of space for all equestrian wants, without interfering
with the sylvan delights of nurserymaids, children, lovers of nature,
and all sorts of lovers too. For my part, if this is not put forward as
an alternative scheme, I shall vote for tunnelling under the Gardens
out of simple cussedness. If the reply, authoritatively given, be
that the two schemes can go and must go together, then I will vote
for both, only let's have the equestrian arrangement first.
Yours, Joltin Thott,
Mount, Street, W. Captain lit Light* and Liver Brigade.
THE TRIUMPH OF BLACK AND WHITE.
"Aftrk all, the beat of Keene's life-work ii to be found in the inmi'
merable cuts which he contributed to Punch during a period of nearly forty
years; and still more in the originals of these, the masterly pen-and-ink
drawings which are now for the first time shown in a collected form to the
Public."
So says Mr. Claude Phillips, in his "Prefatory Note," to the
"Catalogue of a Collection of Drawings of the late Chablts Ki ■ ene,"
now on view at the Rooms of the Fine Arts Sooiety, 148, New Bond
Street.
If the British Public possess that "taste for Art" and that
"sense of humour" which some claim for and others deny to it, it
(the B. P.) will throng the comfortable and well-lighted Gallery in
New Bond Street, where hang some hundreds of specimens of the
later work of the most unaffected humorist, and most masterly
"l'»lack-and-White" artist of his time. Walk up, Ladies and
Gentlemen, and see—such miracles of delineation, such witcheries of
effect, as were never before put on paper by simple pen-and-ink!
It is difficult to realise sometimes that it is pen and ink, and that
only—all the delightful display of fresh English landscape and
unsophisticated British humanity, teeming with effects of distance,
hints of atmosphere, and suggestions of colour. Many a much-
belauded brush is but a fumbling and ineffective tool, compared
with the ink-charged orowquill handled by Charles Keenb. Look
at " Grandiloquence .'" (No. 220.) There's composition! There's
effect! Stretch of sea, schooner, Pat's petty craft, grandiloquent
Pat himself, a nautical Colossus astride on his own cook-boat, with
stable 'sea-legs firmly dispread, the swirl of the sea, the swish of
the waves, the very whiff of the wind so vividly suggested 1—and all
in some few square inches of " Black-and-White 1"
Look, again, at the breadth of treatment, the power of humorous
characterisation, the strong charm of technique, the colour, the action,
the marvellous ease and accuraoy of street perspective in No. 1C
(" The Penny Toy!"). ActionP Why, you can tee the old lady
jump, let alone the frog I Fix your eye on the frightened dame's
foot, and you'll swear it jerks in time to the leap of the "horrid
reptile."
Or at that vivid bit of London "hoarding," and London low
life, and London street-distance in " 'Andicapped.'" (No. 25.) Good
as is the "gaol-bird," is not the wonderfully real "hoarding"
almost better P
Who now oan draw—or, for that matter, paint—suoh a shopkeeper,
inch a shop, such a child customer as those in "All Alive."'
(No. 411, where the Little Girl a-tip-toe with a wedge of cheap
"Cheddar" at the counter, comes down upon him of the apron with
the crusher. "Oh, mother's sent baok this piece o' cheese, 'cause
father says if he wants any bait when he's goin' a fishin', he oan dig
'em up in our garden 1"
Are you a fisherman, reader P Then will you feel your angling
as well as your artistic heart warmed by No. 75 (" The Old Adam")
and No. 6 (" Wet and Dry "), the former especially! What water,
what Scotch boys, what a "prenoipled" (but piscatorial) "Mee-
nister"! Don't you feel your elbow twitch? Don't you want to
snatch the rod from Sandy McDouqai's hand, and land that" fush"
yourself, Sawbath or no Sawbath P
But, bless us, one wants to describe, and praise, and purchase
them all I A Keenb drawing, almost any Keene drawing, is
",a thing of beauty and a joy for ever " to everyone who has an eye
for admirable art and adorable drollery. And good as is the fun
of these drawings, the graphio force, and breadth, and delicacy, and
freshness, and buoyancy, and breeziness. and masterly ease, and
miraculous open-airiness, and general delight fulness of them, are
yet more marked and marvellous. Time would fail to tell a tithe
of their merits. An essay might be penned on any one of them—
might, but fate forbid it should be, unless a sort of artistic Charles
Lamb could take the task in hand. Better far go again to New Bond
Street and pass another happy hour or two with the ruddy rustics
and 'cute cockneys, the Scotch elders and Anglican curates, the
stodgy "Old Gents" and broad-backed, bunchy middle-class
matrons, the paunchy port-swigging-buffers, and hungry but alert
street-boys, the stertorous cabbies, and chatty' bus-drivers, the
"festive" diners-out and wary waiters, the Volunteers and
vauriens, the Artists and 'Arries, the policemen and sportsmen,
amidst the incomparable street scenes, and the equally inimitable
lanes, coppices, turnip-fields and stubbles, green glades and snow-
bound country roads of wonderful, ever-delightful, and—for his com-
rades and the Public alike—all-too-soon-departed Charles Keene!
Nothing really worthy of his astonishing life-work, of even that
part of it exhibited here, could be written within brief compass,
even by the most appreciative, admiring, and art-loving of his
sorrowing friends or colleagues. Let the British Public go to New
Bond Street, and see for itself, in the very hand-work of this great
artist, what he made manifest during so many years in the pages of
Punch, namely, the supreme triumph of "Black-and-White" in
the achievements of its greatest master.

KING STORK AND KING LOG.
An Old Fable Reversed.

The Frogs, who lived a free and easy life
(As in the ancient fable)
Though not quite clear from internecine strife,
Fancied they were well able
To do without a King. Batraohian wisdom
Disdains the rule of fogeydom and quizdom,
And Frogs as soon would take to bibs and
oorals,
As ask a "King who might inspect their
morals"
From" Jupiter. Then 'twas Juventui Mundi;
The true King-maker now is—Mrs. Grundy,
And she insisted that our modern Frogs
Should have a King—the woodenest of King
Logs.
At first this terrified our Frogs exceedingly,
And, sometimes passionately, sometimes
pleadingly,
They grumbled and protested;
But finding soon how placidly Log rested
Prone in the pool with mighty little motion,
Of danger they abandoned the wild notion,
Finding it easy for a Frog to jog
On with a kind King Log.
But in the fulness of the time, there came
A would-be monarch—Legion his fit name;
A Plebs-appointed Autocrat, Stork-throated,
Ooggle-eyed, Paul-Pry-ooated;
A poking, peering, pompous, petty creature,
A Bumble-King, with beak for its chief
This new King Stork, [feature.
With a tierce, fussy appetite for work;
Not satisfied with fixing like a vice
Authority on Town and Country Mice,
Tried to extend his sway to pools and bogs,
And rule the Frogs!

But modern Freedom, which had champions
Bad read old ^Ksop'b fable, [able,
And of King Stork's appearance far from
amorous.
Croaked forth a chorus clamorous
Of resonant rebellion. These, upreared
On angry legs, waved arms that nothing

King Log defending. Great Craugasideb,
Among batrachian heroes first with ease,
With ventriloquial vehemence defied _
The long-beaked base usurper. At his side
His fond companion, Physignathus 'swelled
Cheeks humorously defiant;
The ruddy giant
Csambopiiagds, as tall as is a Tree,
Flouted King Stork with gestures fierce and
free,
Sleek Calam inth i us, aper deft of eld.
Against the foe a pungent dart impelled;
Htdbochabis too,
(Host Terryble to view), [brave
Fared to the front, whilst smaller, yet as
Tiny batrachian brethren, dusk of hue,
Prassophagus, Prabsceub, staunch and true,

With the frog-host against the beaky bird—
"He be our King f" they loudly cried.
"Absurd!
"Not Mercury, nor Jupiter ice beg
For a devouring despot, lank of leg,
Of prying eye, and frog-transfixing beak;

United we are strong to smite or scoff.

Cht/rch ahd Stage.—Let no rabid Church-
men, of any school of thought, ever again take
exception to the irreligious character of play-
house entertainments. Let them read the
advertisement of the Lyoeum Theatre in The
Times for March 13:—During Holy Week
this theatre will be closed, re-opening on
Saturday, March 28, with The Belle, which
will also be played on Easter Monday night."
Could any arrangement be more thoroughly
in harmony with general ecclesiastical prac-
tice? Any liturgical student knows that the
bells are played once on Holy Saturday, and
that they should be played on Easter Monday
is a matter of course.
TRACKS FOR THE TIMES.
[A Magistrate has just decided that the Police
have a right to interfere with the growing practice
of using the public roada of the Metropolis at night-
time as running-grounds for athletes. J
I come from haunts of smoke and grime,
I start in some blind alley,
And raoe each night against Old Time
Enthusiastically I
I dodge past frightened City gents,
And sometimes send them flying,
Which makes them cherish sentiments
Not wholly edifying.
I wind about, and in and out,
Along the crowded pavement,
While here and there the mockers flout
My costume and behavement.
I slip, I slide, I flash, I flee
Amid the teeming traffic,
And drivers often use to me
Idioms extremely graphic.
I murmur when a Lawyer's view
Absurdly tries to hinder
My turning public roads into
A private path of cinder.
Yet still to " spurt," agile, alert,
Shall be my one endeavour;
For Cits may stare, and Jehus swear,
But I run on for ever 1

which is nearly finished. Now and then she looks out of a

hair has been inserted in my cane by my daughter Hilda! The
only way in which a right-minded Schoolmaster can combat this
anarchic and subversive spirit is to start a newspaper, and I thought
that you, as a weak, credulous, inexperienced and impressionable

Hare's Theatre.
KEEP YOUR HARE ON!"
In not following the advice given in the headline to this artiole,
clever Mr. Pinero has made a mistake. Lady Bountiful with only
a very little Habe is a disappointment. The majority of those who
go to "Hare's Theatre" (they don't speak of it as " The Garriok")
go to see the Lessee and Manager in a
new part: and they go to see a lot
of him: they don't ask merely for a
small piece of Habe, if you please,
though they might be satisfied with
Habe in a small piece. Everyone goes
expecting to see him in a good part
in a good Comedy, his good part being
equal to the better part of the whole
entertainment; and if they don't so
see him, they are disappointed. Why
was Mr. Gbusdi's happy translation
of Les Oiseaux peculiarly successful? because it was a light, fresh,
and pretty piece, wherein the occasional phrase in a minor key was so
artistically introduced as to be a relish to our enjoyment of the
humour of the characters and of the situations; but all this would
have gone for comparatively little had it not been for the excellence
of Mr. Habe's rendering of the first-rate part of Ooldflnch, which
did not consist of occasional flashes, only to collapse and disappear
in the penultimate Act, but continued right through to the end,
dominating everything and everybody. This is not so with Lady
Bountiful. The appearanoe of Roderick Heron, who is no creation
of the Author's, as he admits, but merely Mr. Skimpole under
another name, raises hopes at the commencement, which are blighted
long before the finish. The part gutters out, as does Mr. Charles
Gbovb'b John Veale, another "promise of spring." Young Mr.
Gilbert Habe makes a most oreditable first appearance as Sir
Lucian Brent, Bart. He is easy and natural.
For the greater part of the educated audience, it might have been
more useful if Sir Richard Philliter, Q.C., had gone about with
an old Eton Latin Grammar in his pocket, instead of a Horace i and
if Miss Kate Robke had divided with him the quotation, "Nemo
mortalium omnibus horis sapit." He, being rejected, might have
commenced, "Nemo mortalium," and she might have continued,
"omnibus horis;" then, both together, "sapit." Or when she
had snubbed him, he might have made some telling remark about
"Verbum personate," and so forth. The introduction of a quotation
from Horace is likely rather to be resented than appreciated by the
victims of a superior education. What a bad quarter of an hour or
so Paterfamilias will have when Materfamilias asks him for the
translation of these lines from Horace.' Poor Pater will pretend not
to have "quite caught them;" or "not been attending;" but to himself
he will own how entirely he has forgotten his Latin, and perhaps he
will make a good resolution to himself to "look up his Horace
again." Then the learned young lady will be asked by her Mamma,
or by her sharp young bothering sister, "what that Latin means," and
though she might be able to construe it when she sees it, to translate
it offhand at one hearing is a difficulty, and she will evade the
question by say in g,'' Please, don't talk I I want to listen to the piece."
The youth in the Stalls, fresh from college or school, will be about
as much equal to the translation offhand as is young Sir Lucian
Brent when asked by Mr. Cathcart to give the meaning of the
Latin on the ancient brasses in the old chnroh, and they won* t thank
you for bringing school studies into playtime. On the whole,
nothing is gained by this Dr. Panglossian introduction of Latin
quotation; it doesn't help the action, nor emphasise a character, nor
does it strengthen a situation, to bring in even the most appropriate
lines which are not "in a language understanded of the people."
Sir R' hard Philliter, Q. C, might be known in private life to his
friends as Sir Horace Davus (Non (Edipus). Mr. Cathcabt'b
Pedgrift, parish clerk and sexton, is an excellent little oharaoter-
sketoh, as is also that of Mrs. Hornutt, the pew-opener.
As for Mr. Fobbss Bobestboh and Miss Kate Bjobzx, they
seemed to me to be what the author had made them—i.e., stagey.
Miss Dolores Dbtjhxond, as Mrs. Veale, is very good, and Miss
Marie Lnrnxir, except in one stagey bit in the Third Act, plays
with great care and judgment. The interior of the old oountry
church (Act III.) is a masterpiece of soenio art and stage arrange-
ment,—a perfeot pioture by Mr. W. Harford. I wish I could
say the same of the dincAment of the interrupted marriage, which
strongly reminded me of a piotoriai heading to some exciting chapter
in a penny novelette or The London Journal. It is a very weak finish,
and not strengthened or improved in any way by the line Sir Richard
Philliter, Q.C., has to say, on which the Curtain desoends. And
what does everybody exclaim afterwards? Simply, "Why there's
nothing for Hare to do in it. We thought we should see him again,
and that he would oome out all right at last." That's the feeling.
They can't bear the idea of their favourite first-class Comedian
being a sordid, swindling old villain, unless the oharacter be excep-
tionally amusing. Lady Bountiful might be termed "A bald piece,"
because it has so little Hare.
THE BOAT-RACE TEN YEARS HENCE!
(When no doubt it wiU be conducted on strictly scientific principles.)
The crews were met together on the day fixed for the event in
the Council Boom of the Combined Universities Barge moored at
Putney. Fifteen of the athletes wore the usual training mufti,
whioh contrasted strongly with the garb of the sixteenth—a com-
plete suit of flannels. "To quote our ancestors—' Why this thus-
ness ?'" asked the Camford Stroke, as he recognised one of his own
men in this strange apparel.
"Why notP" replied the other; "surely we are not going to
pull in tweeds P"
"We are not going to pull at all," explained the leader of the
Oxbridge Eight, courteously; "I think we can manage the matter
in a more satisfactory fashion. It was all very well in the Nineties
to race in real earnest, but now that we have reached the Twentieth
Century our civilisation teaches something better."
"Certainly 1" returned the Camford Stroke; "and I think we
had better get at once to business. Who has the sworn information
of our respective coaches P"
"I have," replied the Hon. Solioitor to the rival Boating Clubs;
"and, if you will allow me, I will produce them—or rather it, for the
coaches have affirmed jointly."
All present bowing acquiescence, the man of law, putting on his
spectacles, and opening a brief-bag, produced a document, and read
as follows:—
"It is our opinion that Oxbridge, as the heavier crew,_ has an
advantage over Camford, which is only lessened, and certainly not
entirely removed, by the better training of the latter. Moreover, the
steering of the Oxbridge coxwain is infinitely preferable to the
steering of his rival. The times of the various trials, too, have in
every instance given a distinot advantage to Oxbridge. Again, they
have a better boat. So, given fine weather, the result is a foregone
conclusion. Oxbridge must win, although no doubt Camford would
make a good fight for it, and come in a respectable second."
"I suppose we may add, 'barring aooidents'P" suggested the
Camford Stroke, with rather a forced laugh.
"Sir I" exclaimed the Hon. Solioitor, with some severity. "In a
company of gentlemen like those present, accidents always are
barred 1"
"Quite so," admitted the Camford champion, "and I suppose our
oommittee of the latest Senior Wrangler and the youngest Double
First have considered what I may call the atmospheric conditions
under which the race wonld have taken place P"
"Yes, Sir, we have, end those conditions are all unfavourable to
the success of Camford," was the ready reply.
"Then I think we have but one more thing to do—to give three
hearty oheers for our opponents," said the Oxbridge Stroke, and a
minute later the rafters rang with loud applause.
"But why shouldn't we have rowed it out P" asked the gentleman
in flannels— he was a Freshman— a little later. '' Surely that would
have been more satisfactory."
"Not at all," was the reply. "The plan is merely a survival of
the fittest 1" and his answer afforded general satisfaction.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The Baron can highly recommend The Waget of Sin, by Lucas
Mm.it. "I am informed," says the B. de B.-W., that this is the
nom de plume of an Authoress. This Malet should be Femalet."
Be this as it may, the Baron, who is discretion itself, will not attempt
to penetrate beyond the
veil. 8ome of the writing
is a bit tall; but thank
heaven, my old aesthetic
friend, "O-the-pity-of-it"
occurs only onoe; and 0
the pity of it when he does
so, and gives a "Maudle
and Postlethwatte " tone
to the passage in question.
What does "huffle" mean?
(Vol. III., p. 82.) Genius
has a right to oreate words;
and when Genius does so,
the very sound of the word
conveys its meaning with
and frequently without
the context. "But I'm
hnffled," says the Baron,
"if I understand it here.
Still "huffled" is a good-
substitute for strong lan-
guage, when you're ruffled. Don't let the light-hearted reader
be deterred by the slow pace of Volume One; but stick to it, and
avoid skipping. A selfish mean cuss is the "hero," bo to style him;
and personally, the Baron would consider him in Society as a first-
class artistic bore. The character is drawn with great skill, aB are
they all. The description of Mrs. Crookendon's after-dinner party
is as life-like as if it were a well-staged scene in a well-written
and well-cast Drama.
"I have been dipping into Country House Sketches, by C. C.
Rhys," says the Baron, "and have come to the conclusion that if
the author, youthful I fanoy, would give himself time, and have
the patience to 'follow my Lever,' the result would be a Jack
Hinton Junior, with a smack of Soapey Sponge in it." The short
stories are all, more or less, good, and would be still better but for a

certain cockBureness about them which savours of the man in a
country house who will insist on telling yon a eeries of good stories
about himself, one after the other, until the guests in the smoking-
room, in sheer despair of ever getting their turn of talking about
themselves, or of turning on the tap of their own good stories, light
their candles, yawn, and go pensively to bed.
My "Faithful Co." informs me that he has been reading some
very excellent Sketches of England, by a "Foreign Artist," and a
"Foreign Author." The latter is no less a person than the genial
representative of the Journal des Dibats in London, Mons.
P. Villabs. My " Co." says that, take it all round, this is one of
the best books upon La Ptrflde Albion he has ever read. Both
scribe and illustrator are evidently fond of the " Foreigners" they
find in the British Isles. Mons. Villabs, however, makes one
startling assertion, which has taken my "Co." by surprise. The
"Foreign Author" declares that "laughter never struck his ears."
Now our Monsieur is an admirable raconteur, and if he ever told
one of his capital stories to an Englishman of average intelligence,
he must have heard laughter. He has also read a rather strange
work called, What will Mrs. Grundy say t My " Co." declares that,
considering its subject, the book, which is not without merit, might
be recommended as a disciplinary exercise during Lent.
Says" Co. Junior," to the Baron, "Sir, Ii'vejust come across Austin
Dobson and his Four Frenchwomen." "Holdl"ories the Baron,
frowning. "No scandal." "Nay, Sir," quoth " Co. Junior," ner-
vously. "'tis but the title of a book." "That is another thing,"
says the Baron, waving his hand, " proceed!" "It is about Mile.
de Cobdat, Madame Roland, the Frinoesse db Lam balls, and
Madame de Genlis. I recommend it, Sir. 1'olle, Lege ! ". And
with a bow " Co. Junior," withdraws from the presence.
Quoth the Baron, "I was looking again into Saint Monica, just to
see if I might like it any better than I did on the first occasion—
whioh, "with me hand upon me hearrt," as Doctor O'Q. says, I
cannot say I do,—when I came upon the following misprint,—" This
woman, nevertheless, worshipped him as the god of her tdoltary."
It's a beautiful word, "idoltary," and so much better than the
ordinary way of spelling it. So, after all, there is more in Saint
Monica than I had expected. In fact, its chief fault is that it is
too much spun out; and, just at this time, Saint Monica mustn't be
associated in any sort of way with the House at Cambridge where

"THE FLOWERS THAT BLOOM, TRA-LAI"

'In the Times for March 12th appeared a
notice of The Spring Flower Show, wherein
it was stated that a silver medal was awarded
to Mr. Barb for his "pretty collections, which
included the tpurius Henry Irting." There's
an "o" omitted, of course, but it's the same
word. Who is the "spurious Henby Ib-
ving "? Where does this flower of the Drama
flourish, away from the Lyceum Theatre?
What and where does Henbicus Spubtus
play? Does he appear in the Hare-Bells?
Is he to bloom in Covent Garden? or is it,
after all, only a plant? There is only one
Henbicub Irvikgus, and he's not ilspurius."
QUEER QUERIES.
Health.—I am not an invalid, but I Buffer
from giddiness, a feeling of suffocation, with
excruciating pains, and apparent cessation of
the heart's action. I am also so nervous,
that, whenever the door is opened, I begin
to scream loudly. My mental feebleness
finds vent in pnns that have alienated my
oldest friends. Could some Correspondent
explain these symptoms? I do not believe
in Doctors, but am taking "Soft-sawder's
Emulgent Balsam of Aconitine." It does not
seem to have done me much good yet, but
that is probably due to my not having tried
it long enough.—Ratheb Anxious.
A Danciko-on-Nothino Gibl.—Talk of
The Dancing Oirl at the Haymarket—of
course people will talk—why she's nothing
to the girls who dance to M. Jacobi's inimit-
able ballet-music at the Alhambra. Here
they have a magio show, which "puzzles the
Quaker;" and I don't mind admitting that
I was the quaker when I saw a fair and comely
young lady up in the air standing still and
dancing on nothing at all! Certainly "Aero-
lithe" is as good as any of her marvellous
predecessors, the Vanishing Girl included.
As a conjuror, Mr. Carl Hertz, who I take
to be the inventor of the above illusion,
is also uncommonly neat, and this "Ten
o'Clock," to all lovers of the marvellous, can
be recommended by

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

Herbert Maxwell
Performed his task well.
Anon.
remembered as advocate of cause of Working Man. Bestowed much
care on terms of Resolution; invited Government to enoourage more
general voluntary provision for sickness and old age. Then adroitly
dragged in the axiom that " Sound prin-
ciples of provident Insuranoe should be
included in the subjects prescribed by
the Edaeition Code for instruction in
elementary schools." That meant to draw
Old Morality; succeeded a merveille.
"Tobt, dear boy," he said to me,
half closing his eyes, and folding his
arms, whilst a far-away look melted into
newer softness his kindly countenanoe,
"that reminds me of old days. Many
a time have I written out in my copy-
book, 'Take care of your Neighbour's
Pence, and your own Pounds will Take
Care of Themselves.' 'Borrow an Um-
brella, and put it away for a Rainy
Day.' 'Half a Currant Bun is better
than No Bread'; 'A Bird in a Pigeon
Pie is better than three in the Bush.'
Got heaps of oopy-books filled with
these and similar words of wisdom.
Howabd Vincent is quite right. If
there was more of this in our elementary
schools, there would be, if I may say so,
more men like me. You remember what
Who's-This aaid, 'Let me write their
copy-book headings, and I don't oare who
makes their laws. Howabd Vincent is
on the right taok; think we shall accept
his Resolution."
So it would have been, if that eminent
strategist had foregone his speeoh. If
he had laid Resolution on the table, and
said, "There you are," Government would have accepted it, and
he would have had a night of triumph. But he would speak.
Spoke for an hour, and utterly rained chances of the Resolution he
recommended.
Humbert Maxwell, put up from Treasury Bench to reply for
Government, did his work admirably. After fearful fiasco with
Chaplin last Friday, Old Moealitt ohecked disposition to give
young Ministers opportunity of distinguishing themselves. If Max-
well made a mull of this, following on Friday week's catastrophe
with Chaplin, it would be serious. Maxwell won more than
negative oredit of not making mistake. He delivered excellent
speech, showing complete mastery of subject.
Business done.—House Counted Out again.
Thursday.—An Irish night at last. Quite a long time since we
talked of the distressful country. Wouldn't guess that Ireland was
to the fore by looking at the
Irish quarter. Usual when
Prince Abthur is on his feet
expounding and defending
his policy for Irish camp to
be bristling with contradic-
tion and contumely. To-
night only five there, includ-
ing Bbeb Rabbit. Beer
Fox promised to came, but
hasn't turned up. Under-
stood to be engaged in com-
position of new Manifesto.
Towards midnight Prince Arthub.
wearied of the quietude, observed that
he didn't believe there was a single
Irish Member present. Whereupon
Nolan, waking from sleep, under
shadow of Gallery, indignantly shouted
out, "What?" Tanner, just come
in, roared, " Oh!" "Ah!" said Prinoe
Armor, and the conversation termi-
nated.
Explanation of singular abstention
is, that business under discussion is
Vote on account of Relief of Distress
in Ireland. Prince Arthub asks for
£55,000 for that purpose; wouldn't do
for Irish Members to obey their first
instinct, and oppose Vote moved by
Chief Secretary. If they were there, they might be expected to say,
"Thank you:" so they stay away, one or two just looking in to
contradiet T. W. Russell—" Roaring" Russell, Sabk calls him—
when he gave an account of what he saw during a reeentviaitto Ireland.
Business done.—Relief voted for Irish Distress.

Mr. Swift M'Neill "prating."
'Friday Nijht.—Lo! a strange thing happened. Fell asleep just
now, amid deadly dulness, depth of which no one outside House can
oomprehend. Woke up, hearing familiar voice. 'Twas the voice of
Prinoe Arthur, I heard him complain; something about Ground-
rents in London. Not quite his subject; voioe, too, didn't seem to
come from Treasury Banoh. But no mistaking it; same tone; Bame
inflection. Now I oome to think of it, more like way he used to talk
before he came to govern Ireland. Opened eyes; looked down:
behold! it was brother Gerald, opposing Stuart's Motion on Land
Tax. Very odd; think I '11 go to sleep again.
Business done.—Slept. .
THE SONG OP THE BACILLUS.
[Not a week passes without our hearing of a fresh agent to destroy I
Bacillus.] . f | y a[
Once I flourished unmolested, now my troubles never cease:
Man, investigating; monster, will not let me rest in peace. n ■
I am ta'en from friends and kindred, from my newly-wedded bride,
And exposed—it's really shameless—on a microscopio slide.
Sure some philbacillio person a Sooiety should start ■ : . I i
For Protection of Bacilli from the Dootor's baleful art.
Koch the evil game first etarted, and his lymph oame squirming in,
But, 'twixt you and me. Bacilli did not oare a single pin.
We went elsewhere in the body, and it only made us roam.
But it's hard, you must admit it, to be worried from your home,
And methinks the hapless patient had much rather we had rest,
When he finds us wildly rushing up and down his tortured breast.
Then came Bernhetm and his dodges; his speoific is to flood
All the circulation freely with injections of goat's blood.
That is really rather soothing, and it doesn't seem to hurt.
Though they lacerate your feelings with an automatio squirt; i.
Time will show if it's effective, but 'twill be revenge most sweet
If the patients take to butting every single soul they meet.
Next fierce Liebriech, quite a savage, has declared that we shall die
Shattered and exacerbated by attacks of Spanish fly.
We should like to ask the patient if he thinks he '11 live at ease,
With his system impregnated with that vile cantharides f
We perchanoe may fall before it, waging an unequal strife,
But it's any odds the patient will be blistered out of life.
Therefore, 0 my friends, take heart, and these indignities endure,
Although every week brings news of an indubitable cure;
We have lived and flourished freely ever since the world began,
And our lineage is as anoient surely as is that of man;
While I '11 venture the prediction, as a wind-up to mj song.
That, despite these dreadful Doctors, we may haply live as long.
BLONDEL UP TO DATE.
(A Fragment from a History ofthe Future.)
And so it happened that the King was taken and imprisoned, no
one knew whither. His followers, saving one, treated the matter
very calmly. The exception, who was supposed to be wanting in his
wits (he played on the barrel-organ), determined to do his best to
rescue his Royal Master; and an idea ooourred to him. He had
noticed that when he performed on bid musioal instrument those
who, perforoe, were obliged to listen to him acted strangely. Some
of his audiences had frowned, others had shaken their fists at him,
and all had gone quiokly away. Only once had a loiterer stayed
behind, smiling a sweet smile, as if he were enjoying the music To
his regret, Blondel subsequently ascertained that the apparently
charmed listener was stone deaf. So he argued that if his music
had so great an effect upon the population of his native village it
would work marvels in the wide world without. And thus, with a
heart full of hope and courage, he started on his travels.
He wandered, turning the handle of his organ, for many a weary
mile. He passed through towns, hamlets, and oitiee; the people
put their heads out of their windows, and urged him imperiously to
be gone; and as he hurried away he gazed at their faces, hoping to
have seen the King, his Master, but without avail. He felt, that were
His Majesty to hear his muBio, there would be a further supply of
language savouring rather of the dioing-house than the cathedral.
But, alas! his search was in vain. At length, he reaohed London,
and found it as silent as the grave 1 There were no German bands,
no Niggers, not even a hurdy-gurdy! Greatly surprised. Blondel
asked a policeman the meaning of this strange, this unlooked-for
quietude!
"Strike up that organ of yours," said the constable, surlily, " and
I will soon snow you 1"
Blondel turned his handle, and was immediately arrested.
"What for?" echoed the policeman; "why, for infringing the
provisions of the Jacobi Street Music Prohibition Aot I" • i
And with this brief explanation Blondel was carried off to prison 1 I

THE Q. P. O. CUCKOO.

It was a gallant Postmaster that armed him for the fray,
And, oh, his eyes were gleaming as he summoned his array;
To North and South the message went, to W. and E.,
And where, 'mid piles of ledgers, men make money in B.C.;
From Highgate Hill to Putney one cry the echoes wakes,
As the Postmen don their uniforms and shout aloud for Raises.
"Brave Postmen," spake an officer, who gaied upon the throng,
"Ye tramp the streets by day and night, your hours are very long;
Yet since you love the G P. 0. that thus your feet employs,
We must not see you flouted by a perky paok of boys.
Swift rally round the Master who quavers not nor quakes,
Our Bed Knight of the Pillar-Box, the adamantine Raikes.
"WhatP 'The Publio want the Messengers'? We '11 teaoh the
Public sense,
Whioh consists in looking pleasant while we pocket all their pence.
Though the papers rave, we care not for their chatter and their fuss.
They must keep at home their messages, or send them all through Us.
And we '11 crush these boy-intruders as a mongoose crushes snakes.
They have sown, but we shall reap it—'tis the will of Mr. Raikes."
• •••••
But Punch was there, and listened, and his angry face grew red,
Like the tape that Raikes delights in, and he shook his ancient head.
"Raikes," he cried, "I doubt your wisdom, and 1 much incline to
scorn
Those who trespass on their neighbour's land, and cart away his corn.
Let the man who makes the oven and laboriously bakes
Take the profit on the loaves he sells, nor yield it all to Raikes.
"You say you '11 do the thing yourself: Monopoly decrees
That, if boys go making honey, they must lose it, like the bees.
But, oh, be warned, my Postmaster, it's not a pleasant thing
To incur a bee's resentment and to suffer from its sting:
And (to change my humble parallel) I like not him who takes
A nest prepared by others, like the Cuckoo-Postman Raikes 1"
Sousd Aim Safe.—We hear that Mr. W. H. Griffiths is to be
the new Lessee of the Shaftesbury. Years ago, to the popular inquiry,
"Who's Griffiths f " there was but one answer, "The Safe Man."
Good omen for the Shaftesbury.
BAR BARRED!
Scene—A Parliamentary Committee Room. Committee tilting
at horse-shoe, table. Mar crowded at table covered with plant,
cuttardt, bunt, agreement*, and ginger-beer. Huge plant hang-
ing to wallt. View in distance of St. Thomas's Hospital. East-
West Diddletex Railway Extension Bill under consideration.
Expert Witness standing at reading-desk under examination.
Junior Countel {for Promotert). You have told us that there is
a outting at Burnt House Mill, eoloured red in plan—in your opinion
do you think that the road passing by Hoggsborough, coloured
green, could be so diverted as to avoid the necessity of throwing a
bridge over the River Crowe, coloured yellow?
Expert Witnett (with great deliberation, and illustrating hit
remarks by reference! to a large plan). In my opinion I think the
necessity of building a bridge over the River Crowe may be avoided
by skirting the Swashbuckler Estate, and by making a new road
that would cross the proposed line by a level crossing at Twaddle-
comb, and ultimately reaoh Market Goosebury, coloured blue, by
following the course of the Raisensworth, coloured black.
Junior Countel. Thank you—that will do. [Sits down.
First Crott-Examining Q.C. (suddenly entering from another
Committee Room, looking for hit Junior—aside). Where on earth
have we got to?
Chairman of Committee. Is this witness cross-examined f
First C.-E. Q. C. Certainly, Sir. Now I think you say that it is
necessary to make a bridge over the River Crowe, coloured red in
plan?
Expert Witnett. No; I say that if the Swashbuckler Estate is
skirted, &c, &o. [Repeats the antwer he hat already given.
Second Crott-Examining Q.C. (entering hurriedly, at hit learned
brother sits down). One moment, please. Now you say that it is
absolutely necessary to 'pass the River Crowe, in plan coloured red,
by a bridge P
Expert Witnett. On the contrary, I say that if the Swashbuckler
Estate, &c, &o. \_Repeatt hit antwer for the third time.
Third C.-E. Q.C. (entering hurriedly, at his predecessor resumes
hit teat). And now, Sir, that my learned friends have asked you
their questions, I have to ask you mine. Be kind enough to say,
for the benefit of the Right Hon. Chairman and the Hon. Members
of the Committee, whether, in your opinion, in the construction of
the proposed line, where the road reaches the neighbourhood of—
(consulting plan) — Market Goosebury, coloured blue in the plan,
and, as you will see, runs through the—(intpectt plan clottly)—
Swashbuokler Estate—yes, the Swashbuokler Estate—and oomes,
as you will see, if you refer to the chart, near Twaddle comb—having
now sufficiently indicated the locality, I repeat, will you be kind
enough to say whether, in your opinion, the necessity of building
a bridge over the River Raven—(it prompted by Junxor)—I should
say, over the River Crowe—oould be avoided t
Chairman of Committee (interposing). I would suggest that, as
this question has been answered three times, the witness be excused
further examination at the hands of Counsel not present at the
examination-in-chief.
First C.-E. Q. C. (warmly). I consider this an infringement of the
privileges of the Bar. The Right Hon. Chairman must remember
that it is possible that a single reference in the examination-in-chief
may only require cross-examination on the part of the Clients whom
we represent. Besides, an expert witness's examination-in-chief is
very seldom shaken, and all we can possibly want is a note taken by
a learned friend who has acted as a Junior. All of us are occasion-
ally wanted elsewhere.
Second C.-E. Q.C. (indignantly). Yes; and how can we attend
to our Clients' interests if we are not allowed to be in two places at
once?
Third C.-E. Q.C. (furioutly). You have no right to act upon
an old ruling that was never enforoed. Why, suoh a regulation
would ruin us—and many of us have wives and. children 1
\Exeunt defiantly, to return, later on, ready to brave impriton-
ment in the Clock Tower, if necettary. N.B.— Up to date
the Tower it untenanted.

Junr., having received a respectful invitation from some Brook Street
Photographers to favour them (without charge) with a sitting, "to
enable them to complete their series of portraits of distinguished legal
gentlemen," regrets to say that, as he has already sat for another Firm
making the same request (see Papert from Pump-handle Court), he
is unable to comply with their courteous request. However, he is
pleased to hear that a similar petition has been forwarded to others
of his learned friends, one of whom writes to say, he " possesses a
wig, and the right to wear it, but that there his connection with the
Law begins and ends." Mr. A. Briefless, Junr., wishes the indus-
trious Firm every suocess in their pnblio-spirited undertaking.

"What I like" (said he) "in this nook so shy,
Is that I am quiet, and free as a swallow,
Squaring accounts at my own sweet will,
W ith never a fear of the Big Swan's Bill 1
The Swan's as quiet as though he slept.

The Grand Old Swan came out of his hole,
Snorting with furious joy.
Hidden by rushes he yet drew near,
Behind the Canoeist, until on his ear
Those snortings fell, both full and clear.
Floating about the backwater shy,
Stronger and stronger the shindy stole,
Filling the startled Canoeist with fear;
And the jubilant jobating voice,
With menaoes meaning and manifold,
Flowed forth on a " snorter" dear and bold
(A.8 when a party-procession rejoice
With drums, ana trumpets, and with banners of gold),
Until the Canoeist's blood ran cold,
And over his paddle he crouched and rolled;
And he wished himself from that nook afar
(If it were but reading the evening Star):
And the Swan he raffled his plumes and hissed,
And with sounding buffets, which seldom missed,
He walloped into that paddler gay
(Bent on enjoying his holiday).
He smote him here, and he spanked him there,
Upset his " balance," rumpled his hair.
"I'11 teach yon," he cried, with pounding pinions,
"To come intruding in my dominions!"
And the frightened flags, and the startled reeds,
And the willow-branches hoar and dank,
And the shaking rushes and wobbling weeds.
And the wave-worn horns of the echoing bank,
And the Grand Old Swan's admiring throng
(Who yelled at seeing him going so strong)
Were flooded and flattered by that Stentor song 1

ABOUT THE COURT.
At the Royal Court Theatre, which, as I read on the illustrated
House Programme, is "Licensed by the London County Council to
the Proprietors, Mrs. John Wood and Mr. A. Chudleigh."—is the
Lobd Cham berlain out of it in this quarter f (how can there be a
Court without a Lord Chamberlainf), and, "under which king,
Bezonian?" Was it in the days of The Happy Land f—but nomatter.
To resume. At the aforesaid Court Theatre is now being performed
an original Farce, in Three Acts, written by Mr. R. R. Lumlet.
Ah I Ah I Lum ley, this isn't quite up to your other piece, Aunt
Jack. Mrs. John Wood is invaluable, and keeps the game alive
throughout; while Arthur Cecil's Duke of Donotcay—not a
Comedy Duke, but a Duke in farcical circumstances—is excellent.
Weedon Gbosskith is funny, but in make-up, tone of voice, and
mannerisms, the part seems mixed up with one or two others that he
has played, and is very far from being in the same category Iwith
Aunt Jack's orushed Solicitor. Brandon Thomas as Captain Roland
Gurnet/, R.N.,\i very natural. The Office Boy of Master Wilsoh
and the little Oridd of Master Webtgate (very near Birohington
when the boy is in Mrs. Wood's hands), are capital. Miss Cablotta
Leclbbcq's Duchess is equal to the occasion. The two girls' parts are
unnatural and uninteresting. What ought to make the success of
the piece is the soene where Weedon Gbosshith volunteers to sing
"The Wolft" and everyone talks and chatters until the Babel ends
in an explosion. It convulses the house with laughter; and if this
situation had been so contrived,—as it might have been, allow me
to say,—as to end the Act, the Curtain falling on the climax, the
dashing down of the enraged musician's song and the exit of the
Duke, the run of The Volcano would have been insured from now to
Christmas. Is it too late to retrieve this f To quote the title of
one of Anthony Tbollope's novels, "I say No!" There is so muoh
that is genuinely funny in the pieoe, that if the alteration is done
with a will, hie et nunc, why within a week the pieoe could be fixed
securely in its place for the London season, and beyond it. Let
funny little Wkedon reconsider his make-up, and oome out as the
flaxen-headed M.P. of a Saxon constituency. And a word in his
ear,—Sothern fashioned Lord Dundreary out of a worse part than
this. The Volcano shouldn't " bust up." That's my opinion, as
A Friend at Court.
A SCHOOL OF CRITICISM.
From the Queen. A Correspondent writes:—
"Journalism.—I want to become a Dramatic Critio; how should I begin?
I am fond of going to the theatre, but find it difficult to remember the plot of
the play afterwards. What kind of notices do Editors prefer?—Hittrionica."
Isn't it Mr. David Anderson who has set up a flourishing School
for Journalists P Why shouldn't there be a School for Critics? The
Master would take his pupils to the Theatre regularly, and could
lecture on the Play as it proceeded. Should Managers and Actors
be so blind to the best interests of their Art as to refuse to allow the
play to be stopped from time to time to allow of the Instructor's re-
marks, then he would have to wait until after eaoh Act, and retire
with his pupils into some quiet corner of the Refreshment-room,
where he could give his lecture. Or teacher and pupils could hear a
Scene or an Act every night,—and if they paid for their places (a
reduction being made for a quantity), the particular drama they
patronised would be considerably benefited by this plan.
There might be a uniform or an academic costume for these criti-
cal scholars—say Shakspearian collars, Undergraduate gown, and
portable mortar-board, to fold up, and be sat upon. There might be
a row reserved for them at the back of the Dress Cirole, and twenty-
five per cent, reduction on tickets for a series. The M.C., or Master
of Critics, would take a fee for a'oourse from eaoh pupil. Fee to
include seat at theatre, instruction, and supper aftertcards.
Important Contribution towards the Universal Language.—
"Hallo I " being the recognised telephonio summons in use between
companies and individuals of all nationalities, may be already con-
sidered as " Hallo'd by a variety of associations."

alone with you in solitude, when
you showed me all jour thoughts
without reserve,—little by little,
somehow the fancy passed off. 1
caught the Rosmeb view of life badly, and dnlness descended on
my soul as an extinguisher upon one of our Northern dips. The
Rosmeb view of life is ennobling, very—but hardly lively. And
I've more yet to tell you.
Rosmer (turning it off). Isn't that enough for one evening P
Reb. (almost voiceless). No, dear. I have a Past—behind me I
Rosmer. Rehind you P How strange. I had an idea of that sort
already. (Starts, as if in fear.) A joke 1 (Sadly.) Ah.no—no, I
must not give way to that.' Never mind the Past, Rebecca; I once
thought that I had made the grand discovery that, if one is onl;
virtuous, one will be happy. I see now it was too daring, too
— an immature dream. W hat bothers me is that I oan't—somehow I
can't—believe entirely in you—I am not even sure that I have
ennobled you so very much—t»n'< it terrible P
Reb. (wringing her hands). Oh, this killing doubt! (Looks darkly
at him.) Is there anything I can do to convince you P
Rosmer (as if impelled to speak against his will). Yes, one thing—
only I'm afraid you wouldn't see it in the same light. And yet
I must mention it. It is like this. I want to recover faith in my
mission, in my power to ennoble human souls. And, as a logical
thinker, this I cannot do now, unless—well, unless you jump into
the mill-race, too, like Beata I

A GRAND OLD WETTERUN!
I ain't bin werry well lately, and, to crown the hole, I was
oort in the Lizzard. I think, as they called it, on that awful
Munday nite, and that was pretty nearly a settler for both my old
bones and my breth, and might ha' bin quite so, if one of the
werry kindest Members of the old Cop-
perasnun as I nos on, who had bin a dining
with a jolly party on 'em, hadn't kindly
directed my notise to about a harf bottle-
full of werry fine old Port, with the remark-
abel kind words, "That's just about what
you wants, Mr. Robebt, to take you ome
safely this most orful nite 1" And so it
were,! and I didn't waste a single drop
on it.
However, I was obligated to have a good
long rest, l which 1 took out mostly in
sleep; but, jest as I was preparing to
set out for the '' Grand Hotel," in comes my

Son; and he says tome, "Guvnor," says

when he wants me to do sumthink—" I wants you to do me the favour
to ask Mr. Punch for to do you a favour." "Why, what do you
mean f" says I. "Why, this is what I means," says he. "About
the grandest feller as ewer in the hole world gave up fifty years of
his useful life to trying to make hundreds of stupid boys into clever
boys, and hundreds of bad boys into good boys, and hundreds of
dull boys into witty boys, is a going for to have a testimonial given
him by sum of them hundreds of boys, me among 'em, to sellybrate
bis Jewbilly, same as the Queen had the other day. Ewery one of
us as lives in London will jump at the chance; but the boys as he
turns out from the great City of Lundon Skool is such reel fust-

wherever any smart, clever English chap goes, if he wood most
kindly let this littel matter be mentioned, the grandest, and suok-

So says my Sun, and prowd I was' to lissen to his words; and
this is what I can add to them from my own knowlidg. There's

THE JOLLY YOUNG WATERMAN.
(Latttt Version; suggested by a Case at the London Sessions.)
And did you not hear of a jolly young Waterman,
Who on the river his wherry did ply?
When rowing along with great skill and dexterity,
A Cask of Madeira it oaught his pleased eye.
It looked so nice, he rowed up steadily,
Transferred that cask to his boat right readily;
And he eyed the dear drink with so eager an air,
For the name on the cask not a jot did he care.
When smart Eddabd Satxl got that cask in his wherry,
He cleaned it out—partly—with swiggings not small,
And with his companions—what wonder ?—made merry;
Madeira's a wine that's not tippled by all.
One fancies one hears 'em a laughing and cheering,
Says Eddabd, "My boys, this is better than beenng!
A Waterman's life would be free from all care
If he often dropped on treasure trove like that there."
And yet but to think now how strangely things happen!
They copped him for " larceny by finding,"—that's all!
But Saul couldn't read, and the jury was kindly.
So Eddabd got off, though his chance appeared small.
Now would this young Waterman keep out of sorrow,
No derelict casks let him—shall we say, borrow?
Madeira is nice, but you'd best have a care,
Before swigging the wine, that it's yours fair and square!

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Tbs Childhood and Youth of Dickens, a sort of short postscript to
Fobsteb's Life, very well got up by its publishers Hutchinson & Co.,
will interest those who for the third or fourth time are going through
a course of Dickens.
The Baron is an amateur of pocket-books and note-books. The
best pocket-book must contain a calendar-diary,
and as little printed matter, and as much space
for notes, as possible. No pocket>book is perfect
without some sort of patent penoil, of whioh the
writing-metal,
when used on a
damp surface,
will serve as well
as do pen and
ink on ordinary
paper. Such _ a
pocket-book with
such a penoil the
Baron has long
had in use, the
product of John
Walker & Co.,
of Farringdon
House. It should
be called The Walker Pocket-book, or Pedestrian11 Companion;
for, as "He who runs may read," so, with this handy combina-
tion, "He who walks may write." The Baron is led to mention
this d propot of a novelty by T. J. Smith and Downes, called The
Self-registering Pocket Note-book, a very neat invention, qua
Note-book only, but of which only one size has the invaluable
patent pencil. The ordinary penoil entails carrying a knife, and,
though this is good for the cutler—" I know that man, he comes
from Shtffield"—yet it is a defect which is a constant source of
worry to the ordinary note-taker. Otherwise, Messrs. Smith and
Downes' artfulness in making the pencil serve as a marker, so that
the latest note can at onoe be found, is decidedly ingenious, and
may probably be found most useful. Experientia docet: Baroniut
tentalit.
While on the subject of pocket-books, the Baron must thank
Messrs. Cassell & Co. for the pocket volumes of the National
Library edited by Henhy Moblet, and ventures to recommend as a
real travelling companion, Estayt, Civil and Moral, by Francit
Bacon. In the eighteenth Essay " Of Travel," the chief Diarists,
"Letts and Son," might find a motto for their publications. The
Baron directs their attention to this side of Bacon from which this
is a slioe,—"Let Diaries, therefore.be brought in ute." A new read-
ing for advertising purposes would change "Let" into " Letts," or
Letts could be interpolated in braokets. A oheeky way of treating
Bacon," says the Baron's friend little Funniman (Author of Funni-
man't Poor Jokes); but, if nothing worse than this can be said against
tie Baron's suggestion, why, "Letts adopt it," says
The Babon db Book-Wobhs.

a:
SUFFERING ON THE SILVER STREAK."
These Gentlemen (after a few Hours' best) declared unanimously in favour of tee proposed Channel Tubular Railway.
HANDS AS THEY ARE SHOOK.
(New Style.)
In healthier times, when friends would meet
Their friends in chamber, park, or street,
Each, as hereunder, eaoh would greet.
Your level hand went forth; you elasped
Tour crony's; eaoh his comrade's grasped—
If roughly, neither friend was rasped.
Such was the good old-fashioned one
Of honest British " How d'ye do?"
I think it manly still—don't you?
But note, when smug acquaintance hails
A set that would be " smart," but fails,
Another principle prevails.
The arm, in lifted curve displayed,
Droops limply o'er the shoulder-blade,
As needing some chirurgeon's aid:
The wrist is wrenched of Jones and Brown,
Those ornaments of London Town;
Their listless fingers dribble down:
Brown reaches to the knuckle-hones
Of thus-excruciated Jones;
Brown's hand the same affliotion owns.
At length his finger-tips have pressed
The fingers of his Jones distressed:
Both curvatures then Bink to rest.
A sort of anguish lisped proceeds
From cither's mouth, but neither heeds
The other's half-heroic deeds.
Exhausted, neither muoh can say;
Complacent, each pursues his way;
And J ones axd Brown have lived to-day.
Is Bbown some Altruist in disguise,
And Jones an Ibsenite likewise,
That thus they flop and agonise ?—
Or are the pair affected fools,
"Who catch by rote the silly rules
Of third-rate fashionable schools t
COURT COLD!
For both have sought by strenuous strain
To demonstrate, in face of pain,
That friends they were, and friends remain.
Ah. wonderful I Can Poets deem
Self-eacrifioe a fading dream P
Are salutations what they seem?
[A Page from the Diary of a Chaperon.)
They commanded her to rise early. She
knew that the day's doings would be a ter-
rible ordeal, but she came of a bold and
sturdy race, and felt herself equal to any
emergency. And so as the morning broke—
as daylight orept through the foggy air—she
prepared for the saorifice. Yes, sacrifice;
tor was it not a saorifioe to barter away youth,
pride, nay, life itself! And I had a hand in
the matter 1 Ah, me—but away with vain
regret!
I have been told since that they were hours
and hours arranging her toilette. So long
did it take that she was scarcely able to break
her fast. She had, I believe, a cup of tea, and
if rumour is to be credited, a couple of slices of
thin bread-and-butter! Well, it is over now,
and I can think of it almost without tears!
I called for her shortly after noon—for the
lot had fallen upon me, and I was destined to
attend her to her doom—she was very calm,
and'even smiled as I kissed her. She shivered
a little as she sank beside me. I bade her
to wrap her shawl more closely around her,
and after she had complied with my com-
mand she seemed more at ease.
And now our conveyance had come to a
full stop. We were surrounded by a sea of
vulgar, hideous faoes, grinning and mocking
at us! My charge clung to me for protection.
The laughter ana the jeers increased tenfold.
Then I oast her away from me roughly,
whereupon followed yells mixed with savage
laughter. She, poor girl, regained her
composure, and gazed at the multitude with
the dignity of an outraged queen. And they
laughed the more! Laughed the more!
At length we were set free, and made our
way to a large apartment, where we were
divested of our wraps, and left in costumes
better adapted to late June than to early
March, or mid-December. We were then
ordered to advance. We were driven from
one bitterly oold room to another, until we
knew not whether the blood was circulating
in our veins, or had frozen. We had many
fellow-sufferers, and these poor creatures
pushed against us, and fought with us. The
great object of everyone was to get to the end
of our journey!
She staggered bravely along, until at last
they took away the yards of satin she carried
round her arm, and spread it out behind.
Then her name was uttered, or, rather, mis-
pronounced. She sank on her knees; and,
on regaining her feet, was hustled, away, to
follow a number of fellow-victims who had
been treated with like indignity.
_ Onoe more there was the bitter oold. This
time the draughts were met in that hall, and
endured, until the conveyance arrived to move
us on—she to stand for a couple of hours
amidst gossiping friends, and I to go to bed.
But the seeds of death were sown! She
never recovered the shock, and an addition to
the inscriptions above the family-vault tells of
her early decease!
And who was this poor girl? A homeless
one, wandering the streets of London P or a
political prisoner, on her way to Siberia P
Neither! She was merely a debutante, attend-
ing her first (and last) Spring Drawing-room
at Buckingham Palace!
None (by Our Own Noodle). — Father
Buonaparte, at the Olympic, judging from the
account of it in the Timet, seems to consist
of "apart" for our Wilson Barrett, the
remainder being skeletonish, or "boney."

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FBOM THE DIABY OF TOBY, M.P.
Houte of Commons, Monday, March 16.—House of Commons
really looked to-night as if it meant fighting. No laok of matter
for quarrel. Even before public business was reached, Orders
bristled with Motions raising controversial points. Lord Cituitnei,-
Tannel, that man of peace, was to the fore; his Bill, extending
Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway into London via
Lord's Cricket Ground, down for Second Reading. That redoubt-
able Parliamentary Archer Batman* also on _ alert. Has taken
under his personal charge the social and material welfare of Me-
tropolis; at one time Harry Lawson, on other side of House,
disputed supremacy of position with
him. But, as Sark says, Baumann has
immense advantage of making Liberal
speeches from Conservative side.
"If," says Sark. "I had to begin
my Parliamentary life again, 1 would
sit for a Tory borough, and advocate
Radical notions. If it were possible, I
would, with such a programme, like to
represent one of the Universities, Ox-
ford for choice. There's a sameness
about fellows who pet up from Liberal
benches and spout Radicalism, or about
men who talk Toryism from the Conser-
vative camp. It's what was expected;
what the House of Commons enjoys is
the unexpected. Gbandolph knows
that very well. If he'd come out as a
Liberal, he wouldn't have been half
the power he is. The secret of success
in political life, my young friend, is to
sit in darkness, and clothe yourself with
light. The thing doesn't hold good in
the converse direction. A man sitting
on Liberal benches, and talking Toryism,
will gain cheers from other side, but
not much else. Look at Horsman in
the past; look at Jokim in tbe present.
Certainly he is Chancellor of tbr
Exchequer; but, even with that, I
suppose you wouldn't call him a political success?"
Sark a little prosy and opinionated; otherwise a good fellow.
Whilst his homily in progress ground considerably cleared. Man-
chester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Bill put off till to-morrow ; Ken-
sington Subway Bill withdrawn; Baumann triumphant. Still
remained public business; Old Morality led off with proposal to
take Tuesdays and Fridays for morning sittings and Opposition
mustered in great force; Mr. G. present, glowing with his own
eulogy on Artemis. Old Morality moved Resolution with depre-
catory deferential manner; only desire was to do his duty to Queen
and Country and meet the convenience of Honourable Gentlemen
sitting in whatever part of the House they might find themselves.
Evidently expected outburst of indignant refusal, long debate, and a
big division. Some indignation, but little debate and no division.
Everyone on Opposition Benohes seemed to expect some one else to
declare himself irreconcilable. When question put, a pause; no
one rose to continue the successive brief speeohes; before you
could say James Ferguson, Government had, on this 16th of March,
practically secured all working time for remainder of Session.
"I feel like Cltve," said Old Morality; "or was it Warren
Hastings? Anyhow I am amazed at my own moderation."
Business done.—Morning Sittings arranged for rest of Session.
Tuesday.—" Lords" and Commons came in confliot to-day under
novel circumstances. Lord Tannel-Chunnkl, pending settlement
of question about making his Channel Tunnel, is promoting new
trunk line of railway. Means to bring the Manohester, Sheffield
and Lincoln line straight into London; terminus comes in by
Lord's Cricket Ground; invades the sweet simplicity of St. John's

Cupid's Bowman.
Wood: artistic popula-
tion of that quarter up
in arms; shriek protest
in Lord Chtjnnel-Tan-
nel's ear, and shake at
him the angry fist. But
Tannel-Chunnel not
a Baron easily turned
aside from accomplish-
ment of his projects.
Squares Committee of
"Lords"; impresses
into support of his
scheme representatives
of all the big towns on
the route; Manchester,
Nottingham, Leicester,
all cheer him on; Libe-
rals, Conservatives, Dis-
sentient Liberals, swell
his majority. Second
Reading of Bill carried
by more than two to one.
"How's that, Um-
pire?" Chunnel-Tan-
nel asked, carrying
out his bat. "Well
played, indeed!" said
the Speaker.
Seemed at one time as
if blood would flow, and
gore would stain the
floor of House. Barnes
and Wiggins were in it,
but what it was all about
not quite clear. Some-
thing to do with a coal-
truck. As far as could
be madeoutfrom ohoked
utteranoes of Barnes,
there had at some remote
period been a coal-truck
despatched to London
by the Midland route.
Something happened to
it; either it was de-
layed, or it arrived
empty, or it didn't ar-
rive at all. However,
it was quite clear to
Barnes that the time
had come when a new
line of railway giving
direct access to London
from the Midlands was
an urgent necessity.
Wiggins observed to be
wriggling in his seat
during the Barnes
oration. Made several
attempts to catch
Speaker's eye; at
length succeeded; his
suppressed fury was
terrible to behold: his
rage Titanic. Heat least
knew all about that
coal-truck; though, as
far as House was con-
cerned, he did not
succeed in lifting the
mystery in whioh
Barnes had enveloped
it. Whether it was
Wigqins's coal, or
merely Wiggin's's
truck; whether Wig-
gins happened to be
in the truck when it
went astray; or whether
it was Barnes that was
in it; or whether no-
thing was in it bnt
the coal; or whether,

earlier point, there wag

no eoal in the truok when it did (or did not) arrive at St. Panoras:
these were questions the House vainly pursued, withered, as it was,
under the wrath of Wiggins. The only point clearly perceived was,
that Wiggins is a Direotor of Midland Railway.
In ordinary oircumstanoes there are
not to he found in House two more
affable men than Barnes and Wiggins.
Amongst many other virtues, "Wiggins
is, Saex tells me, one of the best judges
of cigars in House, and is never without
a sample in his case. It is sad to think
that a man so gifted by nature, so
favoured by fortune, should let his angry
passions rise round a coal-truck. House,
contemplating the episode, glad to shut
it out by rushing off to Division Lobby.
Business done.—Manchester, Sheffield,
and Lincolnshire Railway Bill, Read a
Seoond Time, by 212 Votes to 103.
Thursday.—House engaged in con-
sidering Lords' Amendments to Tithes
Bill. [Things as dull as usual; House
nearly empty; walk about corridors
through tea-room, newspaper-room, and
library; 'almost deserted; in smoking-
room came upon little group playing
oards: three of them; Solicitob-Gene-
kal, Charles Russell, and Asquith,
Lockwood looking on.
« About that Coal Truck t" ** I anppOBe," I said, "they 're playing
whist; why don tyou make up the hand?"
"Whisht! it's not "whist I" Lockwood whispered, keeping his eye
olosely fixed on game. "It's Baccarat. (Ah I Clarke! I saw you.
Come, pay up. I on did that very olumsily.) It's the Tranby Court
case you know. I'm not in it, but my.learned brethren here hold
briefs on either side, and they say they are bound, in the interests of
their clients, to master the intricaoies of the game. I must say they
have managed very successfully to subordinate their horror of
gambling. Russell, you know, has a positive distaste for any game
of ohanoe. But as he says, a Barrister must sometimes put his preju-
dices in his pocket. Asquith brings to the game a serious aspeot that
positively sanctifies it. As for Edward Clarke, he's wonderfully
nimble. He was trying la poucette just now when I called out to him,
As everything turns upon this, my learned friends say they must
make themselves acquainted with it. But I hope it won't lead to any
breaking up of families. I'm told the Judges
who are likely to be trying cases in London
before Whitsuntide, impelled by a similar sense
of duty, are also studying Baccarat. The L.C.J,
is reported to have developed a wonderful talent.
As a family man, and Recorder of Sheffield,
I'm glad I'm not briefed in the case."
Business done.—Tithes Bill.
Friday. —Young Harry Lawson, with his
beaver up, moved Resolution approving the
opening for certain hours, and under speoial
regulations, of the National Museums and Gal-
leries, olosed in London to the publio on Sun-
days, made capital and convincing speech;
supported by men like John Lubbock, and,
from Conservative side, Matne and Elcho.
Earlier in sitting, the voice of Whitechapel,
Hoxton, Shoreditch, and Bethnal Green, had
been heard by petition, praying for the boon.
But dear old Robert Fowler knows better
what is good for the people. Opposed Motion.
Old Morality, who never goes into his pioture
fallery at Greenlands after midnight on Satur-
ay, whipped up Government forces; Motion
lost by 166 against 39.
Mr. Bung, who had been watching Debate
from Distinguished Strangers' Gallery, hugely
delighted. T,8'elp me," he said, "that'll stop
their little game tor this Parliament, at least. What do they mean
hinterfering with honest tradesmen? If you go opening your
bloomin' mooseums and pioter galleries on Sunday arternoons, what 's
to become of Ms 1"
Business done.—Mr. Bung's; and very effectively, too.
"Flat, Stale, and Unprofitable."
Hampden, farewell I Ere this you may have found
The World you swore was flat is really round.
But many a man, with brains beneath his hat.
Swears that the World is round, and finds it flat.

THE OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE BOAT-RACE.
(March 21. Oxford won iy half a length.)
Great Zeus! was ever Buch a race since 1829,
When Wordsworth. Selwtn, Merit ale began the mighty line,
First of the stalwart heroes who matched their straining thews,
And on great Thames's tide have fought the battle of the Blues?
Who writes of pampered softness? Confusion on his pen:
Still is there pluck in England, and still her sons are Men.
And still the lads go gaily forth in snow, or wind, or rain,
With hearts elate to row the race, and spurt, and spurt again.
A health to you, brave Ampthtlx • the oheering echoes far;
For Fletcher and the Nickalls' lads—nobile fratrum par,\
A shout goes np for Wilkinson, the stalwart and the strong,
For Reggie Rowe, and dauntless Kent, who kept the stroke so long.
For Poole, the tidy bowman, and Hbxwood-Lonsdale too;
Thrioe thirty cheers for all of them, that gallant Oxford Crew.
Nor,—though the years speed onward, and others wield the oar,
Though others race and win or lose where we have raoed before;
Though others, while we watch the sport, should play as we have
And soorn us prosy greybeards—shall Elin's glory fade? [played,
Noble, and Lord, and Franceltn, they each shall have their oheer,
And Bbaddon, small, but quiok of eye, who craftily did steer,
And Rowlatt, and Fogg-Elliott, and Landalb, of the Hall,
And Fison, sturdy Corpus man—we cheer and praise them all.
Punch loves all sturdy men and true, by whom great deeds are done,
And toasts and cheers with all his might the Crews of '91.
LEGAL MAXIMS.
"Tourg Harry."
(Suggestions for alteration and adaptation to Modern Manners and
Customs, after the Jackson decision by the Court of Appeal,)
Common Law.—" The tradition of ages shall prevail," save when
it runs oounter to the opinions of a leader-writer of a daily paper.
Equity.—(1). "No right shall be without a remedy," save when it
is sentimentally suggested that somebody's right
may be somebody else's wrong.
(2.) "Equity follows the law." at suoh a dis-
tance that it never comes up with it.
(3.) "Equity is equality, save when a man's
wife is literally his better half.
(4.) "Where there is equal equity the law
must prevail," in any view it pleases to take at
the instance of the Lord Chanoellor for the time
being.
(5.) "Where the equities are equal the law
prevails," in any oourse it likes to pursue.
(6 ) "Equity looks upon that as done whioh is
agreed to be done," especially when, after obtain-
ing legal relief, the suitor ultimately finds him-
self sold.
Contracts,—(1.) "All contracts are oonstrued
aooording to the intentions of the parties," save
where one of them subsequently changes his mind.
(2.) "The construction should be liberal" enough to suit the fanoy
of the Jndge who enforoes it.
(3.) "It should be favourable" to a long and angry correspondence
in all the principal newspapers.
(4 ) "The contract should in general be oonstrued according to the
law of the country where made, but certainly not in particular.
(5.) "That testimony cannot be given to vary, but may to explain
a written contract," save when someone suggests that this praotioe
shall be reversed.
(6.) "He who employs an agent does it himself," unless it is con-
sidered advisable to take an opposite view of the matter.
Parent and Child.—" A father shall have the custody of his chil-
dren," except when they get beyond his control and defy his
authority.
Landlord and Tenant.—"A landlord has a right to receive his
rent," if the tenant does not spend the money on something else.
Husband and Wife.—"A man has a right to the society of his
wife." when she does not prefer to give her oompany elsewhere.
Birthright of an Englishman. (Popular traditionally, but strictly
speaking supplementary.)—" An Englishman's honse is his castle,
but only the pied d terre of the lawfully wedded sharer of his
income. Old Father Antic.

QUEER QUERIES.—Climate or the British Isles.—As the
Gulf Stream produces Buch an effeot on the English climate, would
it not be feasible to add to the heat of the water in some way—say,
by erecting powerful furnaces somewhere on the south ooaat of
Florida, or by turning the lava from a volcano in the neighbourhi
of the Gulf into the sea? I am not a man of soience, but I
be glad to hear your opinion of .the scheme.—Sufferer

MR. PUNCH'S POCKET IBSEN.
(Condensed and Revised Version by Mr. P.'s Own Harmless Ibsenite.)
No. II.-NORA; OR, THE BIRD-CAGE (ET DIKKISVOIT).
Act I.
A Room tastefully filled with cheap Art-furniture. Gimcracki in
an itagere; a festoon of chenille monkeys hanging from the
gaselier. Japanese fans, skeletons, cotton-wool spiders, frogs,
and lizards, scattered everywhere ah<mt. Drain-pipes with tall
dyed grasses. A porcelain stove decorated with transferable
pictures. Showily-bound books in book-case. Window. The
Visitors' bell rings in the hall outside. The hall-door is heard
to open, and then to shut. Presently Nora walks in with
parcels; a Porter carries a large Christmas-tree after hei—
which he puts down. Nora gives him a shilling—and he goes
out grumbling. Nora hums contentedly, and eats macaroons.
Then Helmer puts his head out of his Manager's room, and
Nora hides macaroons cautiously.
Helmer (playfully). Is that my little squirrel twittering—that
my lark frisking in here P
Nora. Ess I (To herself.) I have only been married eight years,
so these marital amenities have not yet had time to pall!
Helmer (threatening with his
finger). I hope the little bird has
sorely not been digging its beak
into any macaroons, eh?
Nora (bolting one, and wiping
her mouth). No, most certainly
not (To herself.) The worst of
being so babyish is—one does
have to tell such a lot of tara-
diddles 1 (To H.) See what J've
bought—it's been such fun 1
[ Hums.
Helmer (inspecting parcels).
H'm—rather an expensive little
lark!
[Takes her playfully by the ear.
Nora. Little birds like to have
a flutter occasionally. Which
reminds me (Plays with his
coat-buttons.) I 'm such a simple
iokle sing^but if you are think-
ing of giving me a Christmas
present, make it cash!
Helmer. Just like your poor
father, he always asked me to
make it cash—he never made any
himself! It's heredity, I suppose.
"Well-well I
[Goes back to his Bank. Nora
goes on humming.
Enter Mrs. Linden, doubtfully.
Nora. What, Christina—why, how old you look! But then
you are poor. I'm not. Torvald has just been made a Bank
Manager. (Tidies the room.) Isn't it really wonderfully delicious
to be well off P But, of course, you wouldn't know. We were poor
once, and, do you know, when Torvald was ill, I—(tossing her head)—
though I am such a frivolous little squirrel, and all that, I actually
borrowed £300 for him to go abroad. Wasn't that clever? Tra-la-la!
I shan't tell you who lent it. I didn't even tell Torvai.d. I am
suoh a mere baby I don't tell him everything. I tell Dr. Rank,
though. Oh, I'm bo awfully happy I should like to shout, "Dash
it all!"
Mr*. Linden (stroking her hair). Do—it is a natural and innocent
outburst—you are such a child! But I am a widow, and want
employment. Do you think your husband could find me a place as
clerk in his Bank P (Proudly.) I am an excellent knitter!
Nora. That would really be awfully funny. (To Helmer, who
enters.) Torvald, this is Christen a: she wants to be a clerk in your
Bank—do let her! She thinks such a lot of you. (To herself.)
Another taradiddle!
Helmer. She is a sensible woman, and deserves encouragement.
Come along, Mrs. Linden, and we '11 see what we can do for you.
[He goes out through the hall with Mrs. L., and the front-door
is heard to slam after them.
Nora, (opens door, and calls). Now, Emmy, Ivau, and Bos, come
in and have a romp with Mamma—we will play hide-and-seek.
(Sh« gets under the table, smiling in quiet salufactim; Krogstad
enters—Nora pounces out upon him). Bool . . . Oh, I beg your
pardon. I don't do this kind of thing generally—though I may be
a little silly I
Krogstad (politely). Don't mention it I called because I happened

to see your husband go out with Mrs. Linden—from which, being a
Eergon of considerable penetration, I infer that he is about to give
er my post at the Bank. Now, as you owe me the balance of £300,
for which I hold your acknowledgment, you will see the propriety
of putting a stop to this little game at once.
Nora. But I don't at all—not a little wee bit! I'm bo childish,
you know—why should I? [Sitting upright on carpet.
Krogs. I will try to make it plain to the meanest capacity.
When you came to me for the loan, I naturally required some
additional security. Your father, being a shady Government
official, without a penny—for, if he had possessed one, he would,
presumably, have left it to you—without a penny, then, I, as a
cautious man of business, insisted upon having his signature as a
surety. Oh, we Norwegians are sharp fellows!
Nora. Well, you got Papa's signature, didn't you P
Krogs. Oh, I got it right enough. Unfortunately, it was dated
three days after his decease—now. how do you account for that T
Nora. How P Why, as poor Papa was dead, and couldn't sign,
I signed for him, that 'a all! Only somehow I forgot to put the
date back. That's how. Didn't I tell you I was a silly, un-
businesslike little thing P It's very simple.
Krogs. Very—but what you did amounts to forgery, notwith-
standing. I happen to know, because I'm a lawyer, and have done
a little in the forging way myself. So, to oome to the point—if I
get kicked out, I shall not go
alone! [He bows, and goes out.
Nora, ft can't be wrong! Why
no one but Krogstad would have
been taken in by it! If the Law
says it's wrong, the Law's a
goose—a bigger goose than poor
little me even! (To Helmer,
who enters.) Oh, Torvald, how
you made me jump!
Helmer. Has anybody called P
(Noea shakes her head.) Oh, my
little squirrel mustn't tell naughty
whoppers! Why, I just met that
fellow Krogstad in the hall. He's
been asking you to get me to take
him back—now, hasn't he P
Nora (walking about). Do just
see how pretty the Christmas-
tree looks!
Helmer. Never mind the tree
—I want to have this out about
Krogstad. I can't take him back,
because many years ago he forged
a name. As a lawyer, a close
observer of human nature, and
a Bank Manager, I have remarked
that people who forge names
seldom or'never confide the faot
to their children—which inevit-
ably brings moral contagion into
the entire family. From which it
Boo!"
follows, logically, that Krogstad has been poisoning his children
for years by acting a part, and is morally lost. (Stretches out his
hands to htr.) I can't bear a morally lost Bank-cashier about me!
Nora. But,you never thought of dismissing him till Christina.
came!
Helmer. H'm! I've got some business to attend to—so good-bye,
little lark! [Goes into office and shuts door.
Nora (pale with terror). If Khogstad poisons his children because
be once forged a name, I must be poisoning Emmy, and Bob, and
Ivak, because J forged Papa's signature! (Short pause; she raites
her head proudly.) After all, if I am a doll, I can still draw a
logical induction! I mustn't play with the children any more—
(hotly)—I don't care—I shall, though! Who cares for Krogstad?
[She makes a face, choking with suppressed tears, as Curtain falls.
N.B.—The tremendous psychological problem of whether Nora is
as much of a doll, a squirrel, and a lark, as she seems, and if so,
whether it is her own fault, or Helmer's or Society's, will be solved
in subsequent numbers.
BuriKK Late than Never..—At last by the authority of the
L. C. C. his Grace of Bedfobd has been notified that within three
months from now " Looks, bolts, and bars must fly asunder" in the
parish of St. Pancras, where henoeforth existence oi all suoh obstruc-
tion is to cease. We hope that the gate-keepers, whose occupation is
gone, have been amply provided for, as they will now have no gates,
but only themselves to keep. Mr. Punch has persistently advocated
the reform. And now, Gentlemen, how about Mud Salad Market,

See how the flattering things on painted, wings, foolish as gnat-
swarms near the shrivelling blaze,
Flock: nearer, nearer! Forms, too, quainter, queerer, frog-dupes of
folly, rabbit-thralls of craze,
Butterfly triflers, gay-plumed would-be rifleri of golden chalices,

Flitter and flutter in delirium utter,
As drawn by wizard powers.
Oh, "Painted Lady," Summer coverts shady, the greenwood home,

A butterfly befit; but where's the wit that mire-befouled to the

Samlet " up to date" in this " so-called nineteenth century" would
be compelled to give the speech thus, "The original story, I believe,
is written in the Italian language, with which none of us here are
acquainted." But, after all, the candidates may be inclined to adapt
the Gilbert-Sullivan words and music to the occasion, and sing—

THE WAY OF WESTMINSTER.
{A Story of the Parliamentary Bar.)
"You will not forget, Sir," raid my excellent and admirable clerk,
"that to-morrow you have to appear before a Committee of the
House of Commons, in the matter of the Glogsweller Railway
Extension f"
I glanced somewhat severely at Pobtinoton, but was gratified to
find that his face was quite free from any
suggestion of levity. I was the more pleased
with the result of my investigation, as, truth
to tell, the delivery of a brief in the matter
of the Extension of the Glogsweller Railway
Company had been somewhat of an event in
my life. I had never before had the honour
of practising at the Parliamentary Bar. So for
months my mind had been entirely occupied
with the date fixed for my appearance in the
Committee Room of the House of Commons,
known technically, I believe, at St Stephens,
as "upstairs."
"You will be sure to meet me there, to-
morrow, Porthtoton?" I observed.
'a, —-.— "Certainly, Sir " replied my clerk. "But,
as I have to be down at the Mayor's Court
with Mr. Charles O'Mulligan in the morning, I daresay you won't
mind if 1 come with [your sandwiches and sherry, Sir, at two, or
thereabouts."
I acquiesced, somewhat unwillingly. O'Mclt.iga^ shares with me
the good offices of Portixgtok, but generally contrives to seoure the
lion s portion of his services. 1 had arranged—understanding that no
adjournment was made for luncheon—that some refreshment should
be conveyed to me during the day's proceedings, so that my voioe
should lose none of its wonted resonance (owing to famine-produced
weakness) when the time arrived for my advocacy of the cause of my
clients. Those clients had, so to speak, but a collateral interest in the
day's proceedings. The great North-East Diddlesex Railway were
promoting a Bill to carry a new line into the neighbourhood of the
Glogsweller Extension, and my duty was confined to cross-examin-
ing one of the expert witnesses that I knew would be asked to
support the G. N. E. D. R. To be candid, we had a goods depot
near their suggested terminus, and were fearful that their proposed
proximity would damage our mineral traffic The matter was simple
enough, hut I had taken months in carefully studying a small
library of charts, Encyclopedias, and Parliamentary Blue Books, in
mastering it.
On the morning following my conversation with Porttjtotok,
duly robed (I had put on my wig and gown in Chambers), 1 travelled
by hansom to Westminster, and presented myself at the side
entrance to St. Stephen's Hall. 1 had no difficulty in finding the
Committee Room devoted to the consideration of the alleged
necessities of the Great North-East Diddlesex Railway. It was a
large and pleasant apartment, with a distant view through the
windows of St. Thomas's Hospital. At a horse-shoe table sat the
Committee, some four or five gentlemen, who might have filled
equally appropriately any one of the pews reserved in the Royal
Courts for the accommodation of a Special J ury. I took my place
amongst a number of my learned brethren, who were perfect
strangers to me. The table in front of us was littered with plans,
charts, and documents of all descriptions. A Q.C. brought with
him a large bag of buns, and two cups of custard, and there were
other refreshments mingled with ,the exhibits before us. On chairs
at the side were Solicitors; at our back, separated from us by a
bar, were the Public. On the walls were hanging huge charts,
giving in pantomimio proportions the proposed progress of the pro-
jected line. In the corners of these charts were explanations why
such a part was coloured green, or red, or blue. During the day's
proceedings an .attendant was told off to trace the course of a
counsel's harangue by pointing out, with a lecturer's wand, the
various places referred to in his speech.
I was gratified to find that the expert whose evidence it was my
duty to test by cross-examination, was soon in the witness-box.
He was a gentleman of considerable bulk, whioh gave one of my
learned friends, who was the first to take him in hand, the oppor-
tunity of saying, that he was a "witness of great weight," a remark
whioh cau«ed muoh laughter—even the Chairman of the Committee,
a somewhat austere person, indulging in a stealthy smile at the
ingenious sally. Suoh waggish flashes as this, I need scarcely say,
were most welcome, and afforded, when they came, a pleasant relief
to the necessary dryness that characterised, perforce, the proceedings.
As the hands of the clock progressed, waiters carried into the Com-
mittee various light refreshments, suoh as brandy-and-sodawater,
sandwiches, and buns. My colleagues, too, when not actively
engaged in the declamatory duties of their profession, partook of
the viands with whioh they had provided themselves before the com-
mencement of the day's labours. Thus the cups devoted to custard
soon were empty, and the paper bags, onoe oocupied by buns,
orumpled up and discarded. I gazed at the clock. It was past
two, and I was getting terribly hungry. I felt that my voioe was
beooming weak from famine. This would never do, and might
endanger my olients' interests. I looked round eagerly for Portino-
TOir. He was nowhere to be seen. I whispered to a colleague,
"would the examinatton-in-ohief last much longer?" and was told
it could not possibly be oonoluded within a quarter of an hour. I
made up my mind to hasten to a refreshment^bar I had seen in the
corridor before I had entered the room, and hurriedly left my seat.
I pushed my way through the pnblio, and had scaroely got outside
when I found my faithful clerk laden with sandwiches and sherry
making post-haste towards me.
"Get back, Sir, as quick as you oan," he cried, as he thrust the
invigorating ingredients of my midday meal into my hands; "run,
Sir, run; I hope they haven't noticed your absence!"
Rather offended at the peremptory tone adopted by my subordinate
I returned to my seat, and was pleased to find that the examination-
in-ohief was nearly ended. I pulled myself together. _ I drank a
glass of sherry and finished a sandwich. My voioe was in excellent
tone, and I felt that the orisis of my life had indeed been reached.
I knew that it was now or never. I had this great ohanoe of dis-
tinguishing myself by pleasing my clients and securing a praotioe
at the Parliamentary Bar, whioh might mean hundreds, nay, thou-
sands a-year. I imagined my ohiidren at Eton, my wife in a
oarriage and pair, my address in Grosvenor Place. All I had to do
to seoure these tardily-attained luxuries was to protect my clients
by my careful attention to their interests. The moment at length
arrived. I rose to oross-examine.
"And now, Sir," I said; feeling that I was master of the situa-
tion, and that my voioe had a magnificent resonance, whioh was
striking terror into the heart of the witness before me, "/am going
to put a few questions to you I"
I beg pardon," said the Chairman, promptly—" you will do
nothing of the sort. You were not present during the whole of the
witness's examination-in-ohief, and so we deoline to hear you!"
• •••••
I could have wept 1 The momentary searoh for sandwiohes and
sherry had ruined me! Eton and Grosvenor Place vanished together
(in the oarriage and pair) for ever!

No. I.—At the Estate Aoest's.
Have yon some nice houses to let furnished ?—Here is our Cata-
logue, Sir. 1 peroeive that most of these are Queen Anne houses;
'* sanitation perfect;" where is the satisfactory explanation of the fine
advertisement?—It is in Spain with the other castles (idiom).
What is "Queen Anne"?—Viotoria comes first, Elizabeth seoond,
but Queen Anne is (the) last. Is then sanitation also something?—
It is the little game of the big builder; it is all your (my, his, her,)

furniture of) Chippendale, Sheraton, M'Adam,orLouis-Quinze. It

carpenter. 1 was .done by iyou or by your brother; I require a
room for my mother-in-law (neuter). — The good mother-in-law
sleeps in the ohamber of boxes (box-room), but the evil mother-in-
law prefers the best bed-room. How many persons are you ?—We
are sixteen.—You are, indeed, suited, Sir; it is an eight-roomed
house. Is not, the noble drawing-room smaller than we have a
mind to?—On the contrary, it is very lofty. There is room near
the chandelier. Where is the "moderate-sized garden"?—It is on
the leads with the broken flower-pots, the capital smuts, and the
industrious cats (masculine or feminine). Is it then muoh larger
than a postage-stamp ?—Deoidedly not, Sir. It is also nearly as
stioky. Much rain produoes weeds. Where are "the bath-
rooms"? I only perceived a watering-pot.—Any rooms in which
you put baths, are bath-rooms. What is then the prioe ?—The
exorbitant olient of the first-class agent demands four hundred
guineas for the season. It is too muoh.—He would take less in
some minutes; but my commission will rest the Bame. Here are
"Commanding mansions," "Bijou maisonettes," and "Desirable
residences."—It is not diffionlt; the mansion that has a baok-staircase
is commanding, the " Bijou" is for the newly-married, or the actress,
but the "Desirable residence" is what you desire. What is then
the "square hall" P—It is neither round nor oblong; therefore it ia
square. It is likewise in a square. Is it geometrically the same
as the Bridge of Asses P—I do not know. Sir. Where is the
oapital accommodation for the poor servants r—It resembles the dark
kennel of the sad dog. What are dilapidations and electric light P
—The first, Sir, is what you break; the seoond is what breaks you. If I were to let my own house, and then to myself take it,

TAKEN UPON TRUST.
[A Fair-and-Onfairy Story, Foundtd upon a Magic Act.)
Once upon a time there existed two fatherless and motherless
orphans, who were just old enough to work for their living. Un-
fortunately they did not know how to dig, were too proud to beg,
and had conscientious scruples that prevented them from stealing.
Besides, one of the two was a girl; and there
were not many openings for her. And matters
would have gone very hard with them, in-
deed, had not a distant, but benevolent
relative, kindly died and left them as a legacy
a sum of money, of which they were to have
the interest until they attained their majority,
when it was to be divided equally between
them. They were overjoyed, and rushed to
1 the executor, who happened to be a lawyer.
B<.: "Yes," said the man of costs, "I am indeed
■ oharged with the execution of the trust, and
'for your own sakes I hope you will not give
me much trouble, as I shall, under the conditions of the will, have
to make you pay for it."
And after he had entered their visit (which he called an attend-
ance) in his diary, to be subsequently copied into a ledger, he bowed
them out.
So the two orphans disappeared a ittle crestfallen; and they soon
discovered that their legacy had the faculty of diminishing. The
lawyer immediately transferred the money, which was invested in
what he called "second-rate securities," into Consols, and this cost
something, and considerably diminished their income. When the
two orphans remonstrated, the lawyer said, that as he made scarcely
more than out-of-pocket expenses in the matter, he did not feel
justified in incurring the slightest risk.
"I am only a simple girl, murmured one of the orphans, with a
nervous blush; "but does not a recent statute give trustees power
to invest the funds of their cestui que trusts in securities yielding
a larger return than 2} Goschens P"
"Do not bandy words with me, Miss," replied the lawyer, angrily;
"I shall act as I please, and if you .or I ask for the estate to be
administered, it will cost you a pretty penny."
"Which no doubt will find its way into your pocket," returned
the maiden, simply. "But surely a 41 mortgage on real property
can be obtained without risk, if you do. not act contrary to the pro-
visions of the Trustee Relief Act r"
But the lawyer was very angry, and threatened her that if she
made any further complaint he would appeal to the Chancery
Division of the High Court of Justice, which would mean, probably,
the absorption of the entire estate in a gigantic bill of costs.
So, with a sigh, the maiden and her brother retired. That night,
as she was sitting over the fire, before retiring to rest, she had a
dream, when a nice-looking old gentleman appeared before her, and
asked her " why she was so sad'("
"Because we have a lawyer for our trustee, who is most un-
obliging, and expensive. I am afraid, kind Sir, you cannot help us."
"Do not say so until you have perused this scroll," he replied,
with a benevolent smile, and he gave her a paper. "To-morrow, if
your trustee again threatens you, and offers to retire, take him at
his word. If I replace him, I will do all you wish—enter into
mortgages, invest your capital to the best possible advantage, and
make myself generally amiable."
"But how shall we pay you for so much kindness P " asked the
now overjoyed maiden.
"By a tariff fixed by the Government. It will be my duty to do
my best for you, and I shall have no personal interest in running up
costs like the common (or garden) kind of family Sohoitor.
So the next day, when the lawyer began to threaten to resign, the
orphans took him at his word, and all that the moe-looking old
gentleman had foretold came to pass. And when the orphans were
getting the best possible interest for their money, at a trifling
expense, the maiden looked at the soroll which had been given to
her?and found it was insoribed,'' The Publio Trustee Act."
And, so far as the lawyer, who had been discarded, knew (or
cared), the maiden and her brother lived happily ever afterwards.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
More about Dickens. By the loving hand of Percy Fitzgerald
the Bookmaker,—not sporting, hut literary. Of making books, with
Percy Fitz there is no end. He is the king of the Bookmakers,
Per ee Fit*. This time it is the History of the Posthumous Papers
of the Pickwick Club, published by Chapman and Hall, and
"inscribed"—why not"dedicated f"—to Henry Fielding Dickens,
son of " The Only One," the Master. Interesting t Of course it is.
anything about Dickens, specially in connection with the immortal
Pickwick, must be interesting, and for chatty, gossiping book-
making we only say, "Give us Fits." He is to the manor born.
He is neither romancer nor poet: "poeta nascitur non 'Fitz.'"
Occasionally Fitz is aggravatingly reticent. For instance, at
page 1* we read, "Two or three years ago"—whioh P two or
threeP—"a curious and amusing coincidence brought the author's
son, a barrister in good practice"—Whioh son P His name P
There were more sons than one: were they all barristersP And.
was this one the only one in good practice P—" into connection with
his father's famous book. It occurred at a trial on the Circuit."
Which Cirouit P Which is " the Cirouit" P The Baron, who is now
the Last of the Barons but one, only asks because the phrase "on
Cirouit" would not have required his query; but " on the Cirouit"
is] another pair of shoes. A trial." What trial P When P At
p. 17, "The Judge entered into the humour of the thing"—what
Judge P The Baron is of opinion that in the well-known advertise-
ment about the Waverley Pen, quoted in a note at p. 25, the correct
order should be, " The Pickwick, the Owl, and the Waverley Pen,"
—not Pickwick last Did Charles Dickens ever write to Forstee
that he was '1 getting on like a house o' fire " t Surely this should
be a "house a-fire," or "a house on fire"; for a "house o' fire"
means a "house of fire," which is not what the expression is intended
to convey. At p. 51, in a note, Fitz says,
"' Phix, Whiit, or something of that kind,
was T. Hood's joke." Was itP If so,
where does the joke come in P
My friend, the late George Rose, better
known as "Arthur Sketchley," used to
say that Dickens took Sam Wetter from (as
I understood him) a character in one of
O'Keete's oomedies. This statement was
given on the authority of Mr. Bails Ber-
nard. But I am bound to say I can find
nothing like Sum in 0'Keek's; but I have
found Dickens there bodily. It is in So. 1,
Aotl. of Life's Vagaries; or, The Neglected
Son. "'Oh!' exclaims Fanny, 'if my
papa was to see me—oh 1' {Seeing Dickens,
runs; he stops her.)" And, oddly enough,
in this edition of < 1798, frequently as the
above-mentioned oharaoter appears, it is
"on this occasion only" that the name is spelt with an "s."
Mr. Fitzgerald, at p. 136 of this book, says, that an actor named
Sax Vale, appearing as Simon Splatterdash, in a piece called The
Boarding-House, was in the habit of " interlarding his conversation
with metaphorical illustrations "—and then follow the examples.
The Boarding-Home, however, is not by O'Keeee, but, as appears
from a note in Sketches by Box, was being performed when Dickens's
short tale of The Boarding-House appeared. For my part, I long
ago came to the conclusion that Sam Weller was absolutely an original
creation, as far, that is, as anything outside the immaterial realms
of fancy and fairyland can be an original creation. Our Fitz gives
Caltkrley's Examination Paper, and also an Oxford imitation of
it, whioh, however, is not by any means up to the Caxyerley-Blades
mark. There is also a preface to Pickwick, specially interesting, as
not being found in later editions. Then our Fits informs us now
many dramatio versions of Pickwick there have been, some with
and some without music, bringing the list down to the latest
"Dramatic Cantata" (it oughtn't to have been so described, as there
was dialogue in it), the music of whioh will always hold a first place
among the compositions of the Musical Baron's friend claiming to
be the gifted descendant of the Wise and Musical King Solomon.
Altogether a vote of thanks should be presented to Mr. Percy
Fitzgerald for his entertaining, instructive, and most readable book
on the immortal Pickwick, says In Baron se Book-Worms.

TALKING BY TIME.
Tns growing pressure of the business ha Yin g

communication between Paris and Brussels,
from five minutes to three, it is to be presumed
that the rush of publio patronage that may be
expeeted when the wire is opened between
London and the French Capital, will soon
necessitate the substitution, m place of the
promised ten minutes, of an allowance to eaoh
speaker of a minute, or at most a minute and
a half for his interview, which it may con-
fidently be expected will not unfrequently
take the following shape:—
Inexorable Official. Now, Sir; your turn

While it's fast to your tail, and you wriggle

A TEN MINUTES' IDYL.
Life is a farce, a dreary round,
A fraud—of that there's not a doubt,
Although I've onlv lately found
It out.
Bad boldly masquerades as good,
Fruit turns to ashes in the taking,
Unpleasant very is the rude
Awaking.
'Tis Spring, when something, so one learns,
Seems to affect the burnished dove,
And when a young man's fancy turns
To love.
With window open to the breeze,
The tramp of passers-by unheeding,
I ait reclining at mine ease,
A-reading.
I've read enough—and not amiss
I rather fancy now would be
A little rest—an! what is this
I see?
A Bight that's almost past belief,
And makes me think I must.be raving,
For there a girl a handkerchief
Is waving 1
Like to a light that in the black
And inky night shines o'er the main,
It disappears, and then comes back
Again.
I know the house quite well—I've heard
Her father's something in the City,
And she's a blue-eyed girl absurd-
ly pretty.
By Jove 1 she does it with a whirr,
It's clear this inexpressive she
Is given to the fortiter
In re.
Of course it's forward—and indeed
It's worse—it's shockingly imprudent
Thus to encourage me, a need-
-y student.
Her form is shadowy—I must
Get out my glasses, bo to bring
Her nearer. Yes—the range is just
The thing I

Not waxworks, but their far connections;

But mere reflections.

Our hostess, wont to pedigree
Her portents, slurred his surname sweetly;
So up my smiler tripped—to me
Unknown completely.
Thus mystified, I needs must bruit
The weather—" It was rainy, rather.
"Yes," he rejoined, "It does not suit

"No, no," he murmured mildly vexed,
"You mean my nieces.
"Those delicate young pain tresses

Though for Impressionist success,
Give me my sister.
"My nephew, he's inspired of course,
Divine, quite autre chose : en bref you—
Forgive an uncle's pride—perforce
Adore my nephew."
Reeling with Relatives, I quite
My compass lost: to shift our bearing,
"Who is the Lady on your right P"
Quoth I, despairing.
"That Beauty, like the portraits I've
For sale beheld of Miss Bells Bilton."—
1' She? She's the representative.

This was too much: what could I try
To burst from such a tangled tether?
The shops for neutral ground, thought I,
Eolipse the weather.
The shops! The very thing. I dared
The shops. '' How wonderful was Whtte-
lbt!"
Dazed at the Wizard's name he stared,
And shuddered slightly.
A silence froze his ready twang:
No more he smiled—from that fell minute,
Henby the Fibst—to speak in slang—
Was scarcely in it.
That smilelessness 1 What meant the curse?
Who could the skein unravel? I did.
This was the Diner " Univers-

THE MERRY GREEN WOOD.
An "Epping Forest" Chorus.
"For ever and again the Corporation of London
send down their proteges, the young City sports-
men who may, or may not, know how to load a
gun, but who are very keen on 'Sport.' Then
the herds are driven by beaters towards the gallant
huntsmen, the forest re-echoes with the report of
guna, and next day you can trace the whereabouts
of the wounded buoks and deer by tracks of blood
among the bushes, and by impressions on the grass
where the maimed creature has fallen in its flight
for life."—Fall Mall Gazette.
Chorus of Huntsmen.
Ob", we like,—we love the Merry Green Wood,
As should Huntsmen bold of the proper sortI
And we would hit the stag if we possibly
could,—
As is meet with such palpable sons of Sport.
Away to the forest we cheerily run,
And wait for the beaters' welcome ory;
And though we are new to the use of a gun,
What matters? At anything we '11 let fly I
So Sing hey, sing ho, for the startled deer;
We warrant we '11 hit him, if he comes near
And we'll send him lame and limping away,
With a shot he '11 remember for many a day 1
For marry come up 1 But it would be absurd
To expect a bold Sportsman to bag the whole
herd!
So he blazes away; and he hits one or two;
And they hobble away in some thicket to lie,
And, after a day or two's suffering, die:
We don't see preoisely what more we could do,
Than shout that "we love the Merry Green
Wood!"
And would settle the stag,—if toe possibly
could.'
The following advertisement appears in
the Standard:—
ALady wishea to have twic* from the country
a SUPPLY of LIVE SPARROWS, for a
favourite cat.—Address, 4c.
There is an uncomfortably blood-thirsty
look about this "Lady's" desire to supply
her favourite cat with some downright real
Sport. For it is to be presumed that she
intends her well-cared for pet literally to do
the unhappy sparrows to death in the most
approved fashion. How will she manage it P
Clip their wings, and set them on the draw-
ing-room floor; or tie strings to their legs,
and let the favourite oat "go for them?"
Cats must be fed. But it is not necessary
to provide them with a "Supply of Live
Sparrows" twice, or even once. We submit
the subject to the notice of the S.P.C.A.
One Pound Notes.—Probable rate that a
fashionable prima donna will charge for a
song in the near future.

LEAVES PROM A CANDIDATE'S DIARY.
March 10.—It has come at last, and I 'm free to confess I don't
care for it half as muoh as I thought I should. I got the letter five
days ago. Here it is:—
45, Main Street, Billsbury, March i, 18—.
Sra,—I have been in communication with headquarter*, and I am
informed that you are looking out for a Constituency at the next
General Eleotion. We have been for some time past endeavouring to
find a Candidate for this Borough, and should be glad to hear if we
may submit your name to the consideration of our local Council. The
pohtioal history of Billsbury must be known to you. Up to the date
of the last election we have always been represented by a Conservative.
In fact, Billsbury was always looked upon as an impregnable fortress
of sound Constitutional opinion.
Our late Member, however, was unable to devote to the Consti-
tuency the time and attention it required. Moreover, I may men-
tion in strict confidence, that his conduct over the Billsbury Main
Drainage Scheme alienated a considerable number of his supporters,
and the consequence was that at the last eleotion Sir Thomas
Chubson, the Liberal Candidate and present Member for Bills-
bury, was elected by a majority of 279. Since then, however, the
Party has rallied, the divisions in our ranks have been healed, the
registrations have been very muoh in our favour, and there is no
reason to doubt that, as soon as Billsbury has the ohanoe, she will
return to her ancient allegiance. I shall be in London the day after
to-morrow (Thursday. March 6), and shall do myself the honour of
calling upon you. Kindly let me know where and when I can see
you. I shall be glad to afford you any further information.
Yours faithfully, Jakes Tolland,
To RICHARD B. Pattlk, Esq., President Billsbury Conservative
Dr. Johnson Buildings, Temple, E.C. Association.
I dashed off at once to the Central Association. They urged me to
accept, and told me that even if I failed, which they said was
extremely unlikely, my fight would give me "an irresistible claim
on the Party." Afterwards saw Vulliamy, the Member for one of
the Pinkshire Divisions. He said "Take it? Of coarse yon must.
Ridiculous to hesitate. A youngster like you, who only left College
four years ago, ought to be proud of the ohanoe. If you're beaten
you'11 have a claim on the Party, and mind you don't let 'em forget
it. Curse them, they never think of a man's valuable servioes it he
doesn't keep on reminding them himself; " and then he drivelled on
for a quarter of an hour about all he'd, done for the Party, and how
"the shabby beggars" had refused his nephew the Morterton
Recorderahip. It seems the other side manage their business muoh
better. Next I called on Uncle Henbt in the City. He said he'd
stick to his promise of paying half my expenses, but wouldn't help
me to nurse the place. However, I daresay that won't cost muoh.
Eventually wrote to Old Tolland, and asked him to call at my
Chambers on Thursday at 3 o 'clock. Then went home and told my
mother. She said, "My darling boy, 1 knew you would be distin-
guished. I knew it all along. If your dear father had only lived, he
would have been a proud man to-day. Now, mind you have that
horrid grating removed from the Ladies' Gallery." And with that she
kissed me and rang for cook to tell her the news. I sloped.
On Thursday Old Tolland called. It seems he's an Alderman,
and I only addressed him as plain Esquire. He wanted to know,
What were my views on the Labour Question? Was I an Eight
Hours' manP How about Vaccination and Woman's Suffrage?
and all kinds of other rubbish. I had to beat about a good deal,
and answer generally, but at last I consented to address the
Council, and to-morrow was fixed as the day. If accepted, I shall
have to oome before a Mass Meeting, and go through it all again. It
all seems rather roundabout, but I suppose it '■ the usual way.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FBOM THE DIABY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, March 23.—Easter Holidays begin
to-morrow; to-night last rally ronnd Raikks; Postmaster harried
from both sides of Honse; the Contumacious Cobb begins it; com-
ments on Coroner's conduot beginning to pall on accustomed appetite;
references to delicate investigation in judicial oircles falling flat; so
turns upon Postmastre-General. Wants to know about the Boy
Messengers P Pack in full cry; Raises pelted with newspapers,
assailed with over-weighted letters; late at night Cameron comes
up quite fresh, desiring to " call attention to the position taken up
by the Postmaster-General with
regard to the Electric Call and Boy
Messenger System," just as if he
had at the moment made the dis-
covery.
In course of lecture Cameron
produces sort of pocket-pistol;
explains it's the thing you'work
the electric call with. You press a
button here, and up comes a
tumbler of milk and soda; another
button, and you have a sausage
and a hot potato; a third, and
your boots are suddenly pulled off
by an unieen agency; a fourth,
and you find yourself seated in a
hansom _ oab, with eighteenpence
pressed into your hand to pay your
fare withal; a fifth, and yon 're
awakened at four o'clock in the
morning with anapology. Some-
thing, you learn, went wrong with
the machine, and it was the gentle-
man on the next floor who ought to
have been called at this hour.
Ganf, (i.e., with hands folded
on knees, sat entranced, listening
to this interesting narrative, and
watching the illustrations rapidly
produced by Cameron, as he
touobed the various buttons.
"Wonderful! " oried Gane, ft.C.

What 's Raikes' loss is our Gane," says Wilfrid Lawson.
Must think this over during the Recess.
For awhile Raikes had peace; quite forgotten whilst Honse, fall-
ing into Gane'8 attitude, listened to Cameron's fairy tale.
'It'» only postponed, Toby," he said, wearily, Cameron (having
accidentally touched the wrong button) being promptly carried off to
bed in the middle of a sentence; "they'll be at me again to-
morrow, and will begin once more, like giants refreshed, when

they come back from the holidays. It's an old story; the House of
Commons must always have its whipping-boy. Don't know whether
you've sat long enough for Barks to remember Atrton? A dead
set was made against him, and he was not onlv driven out of office,
but forth from public life. It's generally the Home Secretary who
is fastened on. There was Waxpole, chronically reduced to tears.
Brtjce was chivied by the cabmen, and had his hat blocked by the
publicans. The blameless Harcourt didn't go soot free whilst he
was at the Home Office. Matthews has had a long run, with the
hounds after him. Now they've turned aside from him, and are
yelping after me. It's very well for Matthews, but a little worry-
ing for me. Of course I don't claim to be perfect. As Harcourt
once admitted of himself, I'm almost human. I try to do my
duty, and proteot the interests of Department committed to my
charge. They come in touch with all classes, and naturally there is
friotion. Just now the howling is persistent, and, I fancy, organised.
Perhaps it '11 fall away by-and-by. In the meanwhile, it's rather
wearing, so pitilessly monotonous. As you said the other day, a
new constitutional maxim has been established. Once Old
Morality used to write in bis oopybook, 'The Queen can Do no
Wrong.' Now he may add this oth er, 'The Postmaster-General
Does Nothing Right.' Business done.—Miscellaneous.
Tuesday Afternoon.—Winding up business before holiday; rather
a scramble at the end. Old Morality, as usual, piled up heap of
work to be got through. Quite easy, you
know," he said. "Tithes Bill, Electoral
Disabilities Removal Bill, Savings Bank Bill,
take them in your stride. What does the
poet say P Line upon Line;
Little by Little; Here to-day
and gone To-morrow. Those
are the sound economical prin-
ciples that should guide a man
through life."
At one time seemed that whilst we
were certainly here to-day, we wouldn't
be gone till to-morrow. Tithe Bill in
last stage took a lot of fighting over.
House wouldn't have Electoral Disabi-
lities Removal Bill or the Savings Bank
Bill at any prioe.
"Then I "11 move the adjournment,"
said Old Morality, in despair.
"Not till you've heard my
speech," said Dr. Clark;
pulled out manuscript from
breast coat-pocket, began des-
canting on the under-pay of
Civil Servants in Scotland,
whilst Tyssen Amherst folded
his tent like the Arab, and as
silently stole away. Example
followed generally by Members
Clark thoroughly enjoying himself, com-
posedly went on to end of speeoh, and then adjournment. Speaker
"kept in" till Thursday to take part in oeremony of Royal Commis-
sion. Rest off, and won't be back till Monday, 6th of April.
Business done.—Wound up for Easter Holidays.

"Stole Away!"
in all parts of the House.
CRITICISING THE CALENDAR.
Sir,—The suggestion of your Correspondent " Easter Egg," who
wishes Easter to be a fixed festival, always coming on April 20, is
excellent. At present, Easter-tide, like the other tide, depends on
the moon. What a humiliating confession! Why should we any
longer consent to be the slaves of the (so-called) Science of Astronomy P
Yours, Reforming Spirit.
Sir,—What's all this fuss about Easter being too early this year P
It isn't half early enough. It ought to have come last Christmas,
and Whitsuntide the same, and then we should have polished off
three publio holiday seasons—publio nuisances, 7 call them,—at once.
Yours, gloomily, True Philanthropist.
Sir,—I have just been horrified to hear that one of my boys now
at home from school remains with us for a three weeks' vacation I
The early date of Easter is the paltry excuse offered by his Head-
master for this infliction. Anybody oan see through such a flimsy
pretext. His brother is to have his holiday four weeks later. The
result is that the boys will see nothing of eaoh other during their
holidays, while their parents will see a great deal too much. How
oan brotherly affection—I say nothing of fatherly affection,—that
priceless blessing, which I flatter myself I always conspicuously
display—be expected to continue under these depressing conditions P
Yours, exasperatedly, Fond Parent.
Sir,—As peeple are riting lettres to yon about the Easter holy-
days, I should like you to put in what old Bobeham—he's our
Prinoipul—has been doing. We all think it a thundring shame. He
kept us grinding away right through Good Friday, Easter Monday,
and means us to go on several weeks afterwards I The result was
we had about half a Hot Cross-Bun each! Old Bobeham akshally
fixed Easter Monday for going over all the Latin irreglur verbs. Pleese

MR. PUNCH'S PRIZE NOVELS.
No. XVI.—GERMFOOD.
(By Mart Moraxlt, Author of " OinbittersJ" "Ardart," the., <Lc.)
[The HS. of this remarkable novel wis tied round with scarlet ribbons,
and arrived in a case which had been once used for the packing of battles of
rum, or some other potent spirit. It is dedicated in highly uncomplimentary
terms to "Masieurt let Marronneurt glacis ie Pari*." With it came a
most extraordinary letter, from which we make, without permission, the
following startling extracts. "Ha! Ha! likewise Fe Fo Fum. I smell blood,
galloping, panting, whirling, hurling, throbbing, maddened blood. My brain
ia on fire, my pen is a flarh of lightning. I see stars, three stars, that is
to say, one of the best brands plucked from the burning. I'm going to
make your flesh creep. I'll give you fits, paralytic fits, epileptic tits, and
fits of hysteria, all at the same time. Have I ever been in Paris? Never.
Bo I know the taste of absinthe? How dare you ask me such a question?
Am I a woman? Ask me another. Ugh! it's coming, the demon is upon
me. I must write three murderous volumes. I must, I must! What was
that shriek? and that? and that? Unhand me, snakes! Oh !!!!—M. M."]
Chapter I.
I was asleep and dreaming—dreaming dreadful, horrible, soul-
shattering dreams—dreams that flung me head-first out of bed, and
then flung me back into
bed off the unoarpeted
floor of my chamber. Bat
I did not wake —why
should I?—it was unne-
cessary — I wanted to
dream — I had to dream
and therefore I dreamt.
I was walking home from
a eheap restaurant in one
of the poorer quarters of
Paris. "Poorer quar-
ters" is a nice vague
term. There are many
poorer quarters in a large
city. This was one of
them. Let that suffice
to the critical pedants
who clamour for accuracy
and local colour. Accu-
racy! pah! Shall the
soaring soul of a three-
volumer be restrained by
the debasing fetters of a
grovelling exactitude P
Never I I will tell you
what. If I choose, I
who speak to you, mot
out vous parte, the Seine
■hall run red with the
blood of murdered priests,
and there shall be a tide
in it where no tide ever
was before, close to Paris
itself, the home of the
Marront Glacis, and
into the river I shall plunge a corpse with upturned face and
glassy, staring, haunting, dreadful eyes, and the tide shall turn,
the tide that never was on earth, or sky, or sea, it shall turn in my
second volume for one night only, and carry the corpse of my viotim
back, back, baok under bridges innumerable, back into the heart
of Paris. Dreadful, isn't itP Allans, mon ami. Qu'est-ce-qu'il-y-a.
Je ne sais quoi. Mon Dieu! There's idiomatic French for you,
all sprinkled out of a cayenne pepper-pot to make the local colour
hot and strong. Bah! let us return to our muttons!
Chatter II.
What was that? Something yellow, and spotted—something
sinuous and lithe, with orawling, catlike motion. No, no I Yes,
yes!! A leopard of the forest had issued from a side-street, a cul de
sac, as the frivolous sons of Paris, the Queen of Vice, call it. It was
moving with me, stopping when I stopped, galloping when I
galloped, turning somersaults when I turned them. And then it
spoke to me—spoke, yes, spoke, this thing of the desert—this wild
phantasm of a brain distraught by over-indulgence in marrons glacis,
the curse of ma patrie, and its speech was as the scent of scarlet
ties, plucked from the grave of a discarded mistress.
Thou shalt write," it said, "for it is thine to reform the world."
I shuddered. The conversational "thou" is fearful at all times;
but, ah, how true to nature, even the nature of a leopard of the
forest. The beast continued—" But thou shalt write in English."
"Spare me I" I ventured to interpose.
"In English," it went on, inexorably—"in hysterical, sad, mad,
poppiei
tlTh
bad English. And the tale shall be of France—France, where the
ladies always leave the dinner-table before the men. Note this, and
use it at page ninety of thy first volume. And thy French shall be
worse than thy English, for thou shalt speak of a frissonement, and
thy friends shall say, "Nous blaguons le chose."
Stop I" I oried, in despair, "stop, fiend!— this is too much!" I
sprang at the monster, and seized it by the throat. Our eyes, peer-
ing into each other's, seemed to ravage out, as by fire, the secrets
hidden in our hearts. My blood hurled itself through my veins.
There was something clamorous and wild in it. Then I fell prone
on the ground, and remembered that I had eaten one matron for
dinner. This explained everything, and I remembered no more till
I came to myself, and found the divisional surgeon busily engaged
upon me with a pompe d'estomac.
Chapter III.
Mr father, M. le Due Di Spepsion, belonged to one of the oldest
Frenoh families. He had many old French oustoms, amongst others
that of brushing his bearded lips against my cheek. He was a stem
man. with a severe habit of addressing me as " Mon fits." Generally
he disapproved of my proceedings, which was, perhaps, not un-
natural, taking all the circumstances of the case into consideration.
Why have I mentioned him P I know not, save that even now,
degraded as I am, memo-
ries of better things
sometimes steal over me
like the solemn sound of
church-bells pealing in a
cathedral belfry. But I
have done with home,
with father, with pat-
riotism, with claret, with
walnuts, and with all
simple pleasures. Qa va
sans dire. They talk to
me of Good, and Nature.
The words are meaning-
less to me. Are there
realities behind these
words—realities that can
touch the heart of a con-
firmed marroneur t Cold
and pitiless, Nature Bits
aloft like a mathemati-
cian, with his balance
regulating the storm-
pulses of this troubled
world. Bah! I fling
myself in her teeth. I
brazen it out. She quails.
For, since the accursed
food passed my lips, the
strength of a million
demons is in me. I am
pitiless. I laugh to think
of the fool I once was in
the days when I fed my-
self on Baba au Rhum,
and other innocent dishes.
Now I have knowledge. I am my own good. I glance haughtily
into [Ten rhapsodical pages omitted.—Ed. Punch.'] But
there came into my life a false priest, who was like the ghost of
a fair lost god—and because he was a fair lost, the cabmen loved him
not—and he had to die, and lie in the Morgue—the Morgue where
murdered men and women love to dwell—and thus he should
discover the Eternal Secret!
Chapter IV.
Again—again—again! The moon rose, shimmering like a Marron
Qlaci over Paris. Ohl Paris, beauteous city of the lost. Surely
in Babylon or in Nineveh, where Semirahis of old queened it over
men, never was such madness—madness did I say P Why P What
did I mean P Tush! the struggle is over, and I am calm again,
though my blood still hums tumultuously. The world is very evil.
Mj[ father died choked by a marron. I, too, am dead—I who have
written this rubbish—I am dead, and sometimes, as I walk, my
loved one glides before me in aerial phantom shape, as on page 4,
Vol. II. But I am dead—dead and buried—and over my grave an
avenue of gigantio chestnuts reminds the passer-by of my fate:
and on my tombstone it is written, "Here lies one who danced a
cancan ana ate marrons glacis all day. Be warned!"

Mcreh 11.—I shall have to be pretty careful in my speech to the
Council. Must butter up Billsbury like fun. How would this do? "I
am young, Gentlemen, out I should have studied the political history
of my country to little purpose if I did not know that, up to the time
of the last election, the vote of Billsbury was always cast on the
side of enlightenment, and Constitutional progress. The rash and
foolish experiments of those who sought to impair the glorious fabric
of our laws and our Constitution found no favour in Billsbury. It
was not your fault, I know, that this state of things has not been
maintained, and that Billsbury is now groaning under the heavy
burden of a distasteful representation. Far be it from me to say one
word personally against the present Member for Billsbury. This is
a political fight, and it is because his political opinions are mistaken
that you have decided to attack him"—&c, &c. &c. Must throw
in something about Conservatives being the true friends of working-
men. Chubson is not an Eight Hours' man, so I can go a long way.
What shall I say next? Church and State, of course, Ireland
pacified and contented, glorious financial successes of present
Government, steady removal of all legitimate grievances, and
triumphs of our diplomacy in all parts of the world. Shall have to
say a good word for Liberal-Unionists. Tolland says there are
about thirty of them, all very touchy. Must try to work in the
story of the boy and the plum-cake. It made them soream at the
Primrose League meeting at Crowdale.
By the way, Uncle Hknky said, "What about the Bar?" I told
him I meant to keep on working at it—which won't be difficult if I
don't get more work. I got just two Statements of Claim, and a
Motion before a Judge in Chambers, all last year, the third year
after my call. Sleepy. To bed.
March 12," George Hotel," BtiUbury.—Left London by 215 to-day,
and got to Billsbury at 5*30. Tolland met me at the station with
half a dozen other "leaders of the Party." One was Colonel
Chobxlk, a Volunteer Colonel; another was Alderman Mofpatt, a
Scotchman with a very broad dialect. Then there was Jerram,
the Editor of the SiUebury Standard, "the organ of the Party in
Billsbury," so Tolland said, and a couple of others. I was intro-
duced to them all, and forgot which was which immediately after-
wards, which was most embarrassing, as I had to address them all
as " you," a want of distinction whioh I am afraid they felt Tipped
two porters, who carried my bag and rug, a shilling each. They
looked knowing, but old Tolland had hinted that the other side
had got a character for meanness of which we could take a perfectly
proper advantage without in any way infringing the Corrupt
Practices Act. Must look up that Act. It may be a help. From
the station we went straight to the "George." There I was intro-
duced to half a dozen more leaders of the Party. Can't remember
one of them except Blissop, the Secretary of the Association, a
ohap about my own age, who told me his brother remembered
me at Oxford. There was a fellow of that name, I think, who
came up in my year, a scrubby-faced reading man. We made
hay in his room after a Torpid " rag," whioh he didn't like. Hope
it isn't the same. I said I remembered him well. Dined with
Tolland; nobody but leaders of the Party present, all as serious
as judges, and full of importance. Chorele, who drops his "h's"
frightfully, asked me " 'ow long it would be afore a General Elec-
tion," ana seemed rather surprised when I said I had no information
on the matter.
The meeting of the Council came off in the large hall of the Bills-
bury Beaconsfield Club. Tolland was in the chair, and made a
long speech in introducing me. I didn't take in a word of it, as I
was repeating my peroration to myself all the time. My speech
went off pretty well, except that I got mixed up in the middle, and
forgot that blessed story. However, when I got into the buttering
part, it took them by storm. I warmed old Gladstone up to-rights,
and asked them to contrast the state of England now with what it
was when he was in power. "Hyperion to a Satyr," I said. Colonel
Chobxlk, in proposing afterwards that I was a fit and proper
person to represent Billsbury, said, "Mr. Pattle's able and con-
vincing speech proves 'im not only a master of English, but a con-
summate orator, able to wield the harmoury" (why he put the " h"
there I don't know) "of wit and sarcasm like a master. I'm not
given to boasting," he continued. "I never indulge in badinage"
(query, braggadocio r); "but, with such a Candidate, we mutt win."
Jerram seconded the resolution, whioh was carried nem. con. Must
get local newspapers, to show to mother. She '11 like that. Shall
go back to London to-morrow.

Act II.
The Room, with the cheap Art-furniture as before—except that the
candles on the Christmas-tree have guttered down and appear
to have been lately blown out. The cotton-wool frogs and the
chenille monkeys are disarranged, and there are walking things
on the sofa. Nora alone.
Nora (putting on a cloak and taking it off again). Bother Kbog-
btad! There, I won't think of him. I '11 only think of the costume
ball at Consul Stenboro's, over-head, to-night, where I am to dance
the Tarantella all alone, dressed as a Capri fisher-girl. It struck
Ton. vald that, as I am a matron with three children, my performance
might amuse the Consul's guests, and, at the same time, increase
his connection at the Bank. Toevald is so practical. (To Mrs.
Linden, who comes in with a large cardboard box.) Ah, Christina,
so you have brought in my old costume? Would you mind, as my
husband's new Cashier, juBt doing up the trimming for me? _ i
Mrs. L. Not at all—is it not part of my regular duties? (Sewing.)
Don't you think, Nor a , that you see a little too much of Dr. Rank?
Nora. Oh, I couldn't see too
much of Dr. Rank! He a bo
amusing—always talking about
his complaints, and heredity, and
all sorts of indescribably funny
things. Go away now, dear; I
hear Tohvald.
[Mrs. Linden goes. Enter Tor-
vald from the Manager's room.
Nora runs trippingly to him.
Nora (coaxing). Oh, Torvald,
if only you won't dismiss Kbog-
stad, you can't think how your
little lark would jump about and
twitter!
Helmtr. The inducement would
be stronger but for the faot that,
as it is, the little lark is generally
engaged in that particular occu-
pation. And I really must get rid
of Krogstad. If I didn't, people
would say I was under the thumb
of my little squirrel here, and then
Kkoostad and I knew each other
in early youth; and when two peo-
ple knew each other in early youth
—(a short pause)—h'ml Besides,
he will address me as, "I say,
Torvald"—whioh causes me most
painful emotion! He is tactless,
dishonest, familiar, and morally
ruined—altogether not at all the kind of person to be a Cashier in
a Bank like mine.
Nora. But he writes in scurrilous papers,—he is on the staff of
the Norwegian Punch. If you dismiss him, he may write nasty
things about you, as wicked people did about poor dear Papat
Helmer. Your poor dear Papa was not impeccable—far from it.
I am—whioh makes all the difference. I have here a letter giving
Keootsad the tack. One of the conveniences of living close to the
Bank is, that I can use the housemaids as Bank-messengers. (Goes
to door and calls.) Ellen! (Enterparlourmaid.) Take that letter
—there is no answer. (Ellen takes it and goes.) That's settled—
so now, Nora, as I am going to my private room, it will be a capital
opportunity for you to practise the tambourine—thump away, little
lark, the doors are double! [Nods to her and goes in, shutting door.
Nora (stroking her face). How am I to get out of this mess! (A
ring at the Visitors' bell.) Dr. Rank's ring! He shall help me out
of it! (Dr. Rank appears in doorway, hanging up his great-coat.)
Dear Dr. Rank, how are you? [Takes both his hands.
Rank (sitting down near the stove). I am a miserable, hypochon-
driacal wretoh—that's what Jam. And why am I doomed to be
dismal? Why? Because my father died of a fit of the blues! Is
that fair—I put it to you t
Nora. Do try to be funnier than that! See, I will show you the
flesh-coloured silk tights that I am to wear to-night—it will cheer
you up. But you must only look at the feet—well, you may look
at the rest if you 're good. Aren't they lovely? Will they fit me,
do you think?
Rank (gloomily). A poor fellow with both feet in the grave is not
the best authority on the fit of silk stockings. I shall be food for
worms before long—I know I shall!
Nora. You mustn't really be so frivolous! Take that! (She hits

on the fit of silk stockings."
him lightly on the ear with the stockings; then hums a little.) I
want you to do me a great service, Dr. Rank. (Rolling up stock-
ings.) I always liked you. I love Torvald most, of course— but,
somehow, I 'd rather spend my time with you—you are so amusing!
Rank. If I am, can't you guess why? (A short silence.) Because
I love you! Yo. 'an't pretend you didn't know it!
Nora. Perhaps not—but it was really too clumsy of you to mention
it just as I was about to ask a favour of you! It was in the worst
taste! (With dignity.) You must not imagine because I joke with
you about silk stockings, and tell you things I never tell Torvald,
that I am therefore without the most delicate and scrupulous self-
respect! I am really quite a good little doll, Dr. Rank, and now—
(sits in rocking-chair and smites)—now I shan't ask you what I was
going to! [Ellen comes in with a card.
Nora (terrified). Oh, ray goodness! [Puts it in her pocket.
Dr. Rank. Excuse my easy Norwegian pleasantry—but—h'm—
anything disagreeable up?
Nora (to herself). Kkogstatj's card! I must tell another whopper!
(To Rank.) No, nothing, only—only my new costume. I want to
try it on here. I always do try on my dresses in the drawing-room
— it's cosier, you know. So go in to Torvald and amuse him till
I'm ready.
[Rank goes into Helmer's room, and Nora bolts the door upon
him, as Krogstad enters from hall in a fur cap.
Krogs. Well, I've got the sack,
and so I came to see how you are
getting on. I mayn't be a nice
man, but— (with feeh ig)—I have a
heart! And, as I don't intend to
five up the forged I.O.U. unless
'm taken back, I was afraid you
might be contemplating suicide,
or something of that kind ; and so
I called to tell you that, it I were
you, I wouldn't. Bad thing for the
complexion, suicide, and silly, too,
because it wouldn't mend matters
in the least. (Kindly.) You must
not take this affair too seriously,
Mrs. Helmer. Get your husband
to settle it amicably by taking me
back as Cashier; then I shall soon
get the whip-hand of Aim, and we
shall all be as pleasant and com-
fortable as possible together I
Nora. Not even that prospeot
oan tempt me! Besides, Torvald
wouldn't have you back at any
price now!
Krogs. All right, then. I have
here a letter, telling your husband
all. I will take the liberty of
dropping it in the letter-box at
your hall-door as I go out. I '11
wish you good evening!
[He goes out; presently the dull sound of a thick letter dropping
into a wire box is heard.
Nora (sofily, and hoarsely). He's done it! How am I to prevent
Torvald from seeing it?
Helmer (inside the door, rattling). Hasn't my lark changed its
drees yet? (Nora unbolts door.) What—so you are not in fancy
costume, after all? (Enters with Rank.) Are there any letters for
me in the box there?
Nora (voicelessly). None—not even a postoard! Oh, Torvald,
don't, please, go and look—promise me you won't! I do assure
you there isn't a letter! And I've forgotten the Tarantella you
taught me—do let's run over it. I'm so afraid of breaking down—
promise me not to look at the letter-box. I can't dance unless
you do.
Helmer (standing still, on his way to the letter-box). I am a man
of strict business habits, and some powers of observation; my little
squirrel's assurances that there is nothing in the box, combined with
her obvious anxiety that I should not go and see for myself, satisfy
me that it is indeed empty, in spite of the fact that I have not in-
variably found her a striotly truthful little dicky-bird. There—
there. (Sits down to piano.) Bang away on your tambourine,
little squirrel—danoe away, my own lark!
Nora (dancing, with a long gay shawl). Just won't the little
squirrel! Faster—faster! Oh, I do feel so gay I We will have
some champagne for dinner, won't we. Torvald?
[Dances with more and more abandonment.
Helmer (after addressing frequent remarks in correction). Come,
come—not this awful wildness I I don't like to see quite such a
larky little lark as this . . . Really it is time you stopped!
Nora (her hair coming down as she dances more wildly still, and
swings the tambourine). I can't ... I can't! (To herself, as she

TAKING THE CENSUS.
(A Story of the 6lh of April, 1891.)
As I have but a limited holding in the Temple, and, moreover,
slept on the evening of the 5th of April at Burmah Gardens, I con-
sidered it right and proper to fill in the paper left me by the
Appointed Enumerator at the latter ad-
dress. And here I may say that the title of
the subordinate officer intrusted with the
addition of my household to the compilation of
the Census pleased me greatly— "Appointed
Enumerator'' was distinctly good. I should
have been willing (of oourse for an
appropriate honorarium) to have ac-
cepted so well-sounding an appoint-
ment myself. To oontinue, the general
tone of the instructions " to the Occu-
pier" was exoellent. Suoh words as
erroneous," "specification," and the
like, appeared frequently, and must have been pleasant strangers to
the householder who was authorised to employ some person other than
himself to write, "if unable to do so himself." To be captious, I
might have been better pleased had the housemaid who handed me
the schedule been spared the smile provoked by finding me addressed
by the "Appointed Enumerator" as "Mr. Beefless," instead of
"Mr. Briefless." But this was a small matter.
I need scarcely say that I took infinite painsl to fill in my paper
accurately. I have great sympathy with the "Census (England and
Wales) Aot, 1890," and wished, so far as I was personally oonoerned,
to carry out its object to the fullest extent attainable. I had no diffi-
culty about inserting myiown "name and surname," and "profes-
sion or occupation." I rather hesitated, however, to describe myself
as an " employer," because the "examples of the mode of filling-up"
rather suggested that domestic servants were not to count, and for
the rest my share in the time of Portington, to say the least, is
rather shadowy. For instance, I could hardly fairly suggest that
in regard to the services of my excellent and admirable clerk, I am
as great an employer of labour as, say, the head of a firm of railway
contractors, or the managing director of a cosmopolitan hotel com-
pany. Then, although I am distinctly of opinion that I rightly
carried out the intentions of the statute by describing myself as "the
head of the family," my wife takes an opposite view of the question.
In making the other entries, I had no great difficulty. The ages of
my domestics, however, caused me some surprise. I had always
imagined (and they have given me their faithful and valuable ser-
vices I am glad to say for a long time) that the years in whioh they
were born varied. But no, I was wrong. I found they were all
of the same age—two-and-twenty. To refer to another class of my
household—I described my son, Shaixow North Briefless (the first
is an old family name of forensic celebrity, and the second an appro-
priate compliment to a distinguished member of the judioial Bench,
whose courtesy to the Junior Bar'.is proverbial) as a " scholar," but
rejected his (Shallow's) suggestion that I should add to the descrip-
tion of his brother (one of my younger sons, Geobge Lewis Van
Tromp Chester Mote Bolton Briefless—I selected his Christian
names in anticipated recognition of possible professional favours to
be conferred on him in after-life) the words "imbeoile from his
birth," as frivolous, untrue, and even libellous. We had but one
untoward incident. In the early morning of Monday we found in
our area a person who had evidently passed the night there in a con-
dition of helpless intoxication. As she could offer no satisfactory
explanation of her presence, I handed her over to the police, and
entered her on the Census Paper as, "a supposed retired laundress,
seemingly living on her own means, and apparently blind from the
date of her last drinking-bout." I rejeoted advisedly her own indis-
tinctly but frequently reiterated [assertion that "she was a lady,"
because 1 had been warned by " the" general instructions" to avoid
suoh "indefinite terms as Esquire or Gentleman."
As I wished to deliver my completed schedule to the "Appointed
Enumerator" in person, I desired that he might be shown into my
study when he called for the paper.
"Excuse me, Sir," he said, after looking through the document
at my request: "but you see there is a fine of a fiver for wilfully
giving false information."
"Yes," I returned, somewhat surprised at the suggestion; "and
the proposed penalty has rendered me doubly anxious to be abso-
lutely acourate. Do you notice any slip of the pen f"
"Well, Sir," he answered, with some hesitation, "as the young
chap who does the boots tells me that he has never heard of you
having had a single brief while he's been with yon, and that's
coming three years, hadn't you better put'retired' after ' Barrister-
at-Law' f It will do no harm, and oertingly would be safer 1"
Put "retired" after Barrister-at-Law!" Do no harm I," and be
"safer!"
• ••••*
I silently intimated by a dignified gesture to the " Appointed Enu-
merator" that our interview was at an end, and then, taking my walk-
ing-stick with me, went in earnest and diligent search of the young
ohap who does the boots 1" (Signed) A. Briefless, Junior.

A FAIR EXCHANGE.
Hosea Big low speaks up on the situation: —
Hfre we stan' on the Constitution, by thunder!
State rights won't be hurried by any one's
hoofs;
Umberto, old hoss, would you like, I wonder,
To 'pologise first, and then bring up yer
proofs?
Uncle Sam is free, and he sez, sez he :—
"The Mafia's no more
Right to oome to this shore,
No more'n the Molly Maguires," sez he.
Uncle Sam ain't no kind o' bisness with
nothin'
Like stabs in the back,—that may do for
slaves.
We ain't none riled by their frettin' an' f rothin'
Who shriek, in Hitalian, across the waves.
Uncle Sam is free, but he sez, Bez he:—
"He will put down his foot
On the right to shoot
As claimed by the Mafia gang!" sez he.
Freedom's keystone is Law, yes; that there's
no doubt on,
It's sutthin that's—wha' d'ye call it?—
divine,—
The brutes who break it hain't nutthin' to
boast on
On your side or mine o' the seethin' brine.
Uncle Sam is free, and he sez, sez he:—
"If assassins gang 'em
I 'm game to hang 'em,
An' so git nd on 'em soon," sez he.
'Tis well for sleek oita for to lounge on their
softies,
And chat about "Law and Order," an' Bich.
A formula pleasant for thorn in office,
Home-stayin' idlers, well-guarded rich.
Unole Sam is free, but he sez, sez he: —
"Whar life's a fight,
Law, based on right,
May need the ' strong arm' of a Man," sez he.
Now don't go to say I'm the friend of force;
Best keep all your spare breath for eoolin'
your broth;
And when just Law has a fair clar oourse,
All talk of ''wild justioe" is frenzy and
froth.
Unole Sam is free, but he sez, sez he :—
"If he gits within hail
Of the Glan-na-Gael,,
Or the Mafia either, he shoots," sez he.
This ain't no matter for sauoe or swagger—
Too summary judgment both scout, I
hope;
Though rf it's a chice betwixt rope and
dagger,
I can't help sayin' I prefer the rope.
Unole Sam is free, and he sez, sez he ;—
"At a pinch I '11 not flinoh
From a touch of Lynch,—
That is—at a very hard pinch!" sez he.
But Lynoh Law, Umbebto, or Seeret Society,
Both are bad, though the latter's wust;
We '11 soon get shut of either variety,
You and me, Umbebto, or so I trust.
Uncle Sam is free, but he sez, sez he:—
"Assassination
Won't build a nation,
Nor yet the unlegalised rope," sez he.
Withdraw your Ambassador! Wal, that air

Don't want to rile, but I '11 tell you what:
Unole Sam is free, but he sez, sez he:—

suggestions made in these columns a week ago,

A COMPLAINT OF THE CENSUS.
(By a Disappointed Duke.)
[For the first time the sixth column in the Census
Schedule is simply headed "Profession or Occu-
pation."]
Oh! I'm a reg'lar rightdown Duke:
The trying part I act and look
Right nobly, so they tell me.
Yet I would have yon understand
Why I am thoroughly unmanned
At what of late befell me.
A week or something less ago,
A sohedule came to let me know
The Census Day was Sunday.
The many details, one and all,
Must he filled in, and then they'd call
To fetch it on the Monday.
I found it easy to contrive
To answer columns one to five—
I filled them up discreetly;
But when I camo to column six
I got into an awful fix,
And lost my head completely.
For "Hank " alas I had disappeared.
I'd never for an instant feared
It wouldn't really he there.
Your "Occupation" you could state,
"Profession." too, you might relate,
But I— a Duke—had neither!
His Grace the Duke of Plaza-Tor'
Would call himself, I'm pretty sure,
A "public entertainer."
But I and my blue-blooded wife,
We lead a simple blameless life,
No life could well be plainer.
In such a plight what could I do P
I searohed the paper through and through,
Eaoh paragraph I read. You '11
Scarce credit it but those who " live
On their own means " had got to give
This statement in the sohedule 1
I put it, but my ducal pen
I saw distinctly sputtered when
I did so. All of which he
Will please remember when I say
I thought it in a minor way
Unkind of Mr. Ritchie!
MICKY FREE IN PARIS.
As to the incident which recently appeared
in the papers under the head-line Insulting
an Ambassador," our old friend Micky writes
us as follows:—"Be jabers then, ye must
know the truth. Me and Count Munstkr was
drivin' together. The Count's every bit a
true-born son of Oald Ireland for ever, and
descended from the Kings of Munster by both
sides, and more betoken wasn't he wearin' an
Ulster at the very moment, and isn't he the
best of chums with the Dukes of Connaught
and Leinster? Any way we were in our
barooshpassin' the time o' day to one another
as we were drivin' in the Bore, when whack
comes a loaf o' bread, shied at our heads by
an unknown military blaygaird. It missed
me noble friend, the Count, and, as if to give
him a lesson in politeness, it just took off the
hat of a domestic alongside the coachman on
the box. 1 Tunder and turf!' says I, pre-
paring to descend, and give the scoundrels a
taste of my blackthorn all round. 'Whist!
be aisy now, Micky,' says the Ambassador to
me, in what is, betune ourselves, his own
native tongue; and with that he picks up the
loaf, miffs at it, makes a wry face ('it's a
rye loaf,' says I), and then says he, out loud,
with a supercilious look, 'Ill-bred!' Be-
gorra, there was a whoop o' delight went up
all round, which same was a sign of their pur-
liteness, as divil a one of the ignoramuses could
onderstand a wurrd the Court said in English
or German, let alone _ Irish. * Goot,' says
Mdnstek to me, dropping into his German
accent, whioh, on occasion, comes quite
natural to him—the oraturl 'I'll give the
loaf to the dog;' and he whistles up the
mastiff, own brother to Bismarck's. 'Eh,
Micky, ye gossoon, isn't the proverb, " Loaf
me, loaf my dog "?' Ah! then was oheers
for ould Ireland, and a mighty big dhrink
entirely we had that same night.

FACTA NON VERBA"; OR, PIERROT IN LONDON.
"Op the best! of the very_ best!" as Zeeo or Cibo is perpetually affirming of everything
eatable and drinkable that is for his own benefit and his customers' refreshment at the
little bar, not a hundred miles from the Monte Carlo tables, where he himself and his barris-
ter* practise day and night; and, as this famous cutter of sandwiches and oonfectioner of

A BLACK AND WHITE EXHIBITION.
drinks says of his stock in trade, so say we of L'Enfant Prodigue, whioh, having been
translated by Hobatics Cocles Sedges from Paris to London, has gone straight to the
heart and intelligence of our Theatre-loving public
It is a subject for curious rtfleotion that, just when the comic scenes of our English
Pantomime have been crushed out by overpowering weight of gorgeous spectacle, there
should re-appear in our midst a revival of the ancient Pierrot who pantomimed himself
into public favour with the Parisians towards the close of the seventeenth century. Red-hot
poker, sausages, and filching Clown have had their day, and lo! when everyone said we were
tired of the "comic business" of Pantomime, here in our midst re-appear almost in their
habits as they lived, certainly with their white faces and black skull-caps "as they
appeared," a pair of marvellously clever Pierrots. Mile. Jane Mat as 1'ierrut Junior, "the
Prodigy eon," and M. Codbtes as Pierrot Senior, are already drawing the town to Matinees
at the Prince of Wales's, causing us to laugh at them and with them in their joys, and te
weep with them in their mimio sorrows. Tes! Pierrot redivivut!
Mind you, it is not a piece for children; make no mistake about that; they will only
laugh at the antics, be ignorant of the story, and be untouched by its truth and pathos.
All are good. We like the naughty blanchisseuse the least of the characters, and wish she
had been plus petite que ca. But is it not in nature that the prodigal infant (veritable
boy is Mile. Jane Mat) should fall in love with a young woman some years his senior, and
far beyond him in experience of the world P Why certainly. Then the Baron, played with
great humour by M. Louis Gougf.t, who wins the Mistress with his diamonds, and the
inimitable Black Servant, M. Jean Abcueil, who laughs at poor little Pierrot, and cringes
to his wealthy rival and successor,—are they not both admirable P As for the acting of
Madame Schmidt as Madame Pierrot, loving wife and devoted mother, it is, as it should be,
"too good for words." Her pantomimio action is so sympathetic throughout, so—well, in
fact, perfect. Who wants to hear them speak? Facta non verba is their motto. Yet with
what gusto the Black, heavily bribed, mouths out the titled Baron's, name, though never a
syllable does he utter! It is all most excellent make-believe.
Vive Pierrot d Londres! We see him muoh the same as he was"when he delighted the
Parisians in 1830,—" Avee ta grand casaque d grot boutons, ton large pantalon flottant,
set souliers blanet comme le reste, son tisage enfarinf, ea tete couverte d'un serre-tete noir
. . . le viritable Pierrot avee sa bonhomie naive . . . tes joies (Pen/ant, et tet chagrins
d'un effet si comique "— and also so pathetic
If this entertainment could be given at night, the house would be' crammed during a
long run; but afternoon possibilities are limited. More than a word of praise must be given
to M. Andre. Wobmseb'b music which, personally conducted by Mr. Crook, goes hand in
hand with the story written by Michel Carhk Fils, and illustrated by these clever panto-
mimists. No amateur of good.acting should fail to see this performance. Verb.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Aha! special attraction in The New Review! "April Fool's
Day Poem," by Alfred Austin, and, an announcement on the cover
that " This number contain! a Picture of Miss Ellen Terry in one
of her earliett parts." Oh, dear! I wish it didn't contain this
picture, which is a bleared red photograph of Misses Kate and
Ellen Terry, "as they appeared" (as they never could appear,
I 'm sore) in an entertainment which aohieved a great suooess in
the provinces— but not with this red-Indian picture as a poster.
Of course it may be intended as compliment-terry; it may mean
"always entertaining and ever reddy." However, the picture is
naught, except as a curiosity; but the first instalment of our
Ellen's reminiscences is delightfully written, because given quite
naturally, just as the celebrated actress herself would dictate—(of
course she never has to " dictate," as her soarcely-breathed wish is
a law) —to her pleasantly-tasked amanuensis. Next lot, please!
In Macmillan's for this month, Andre Hope tells a fluttering tale
in recounting "A Mystery of Old Gray's Inn." It would have come
well from thatjweird old clerk, te whom Mr. Pickwick listened with
interest during the convivialities
at the " Magpie and Stump." It
should take a prominent plaoe in
the proposed new issue of Half
Hours with Jumpy Authors.
The Baron has just read a
delightful paper on "The Bretons
at Home," by Charles G. Wood,
in the Argosy, for this month.
The Baron who has been there,
and still would go if he could,
but, as he can't, he is contented
to let " Wood go " without him.
and to read the latter's tales of
a traveller.
Turf Celebrities I have Known,
by "William Day, is a gossipy,
snarly sort of book; casting a
rather murky or grey Day-light on a considerable number of
Celebrities who were once on the turf, and are now under it. But
the Baron not being him■ elf either on the turf or under it, supposes
that this Day is an authority, as'was once upon a time, that is.
only the other day, the Dey of Aloises. But this Day is not of
Algiers, but of All-gibes. Ordinarily it is true that "Every dog
has his day." Exceptions prove the rule, and it would appear from
this book—"not the first 'book,' I suppose," quoth the Baron,
"that Mr. Day has 'made' or assisted in 'making,' "—that every
dog did not 'have' this particular Day, but that some dogs did.
The writer has missed the chance of a good title- not for himself,
but for his book. He should have made it an autobiography, and
then have called it, "Be Die in Diem; or, Day by Day."
Everyone's truly, The Baron db Book-Worms.
WHAT IT WILL COME TO!
(A fragment from a Military-Commercial Romance of the future.)
And bo Mr. Ellersdee approached his proposed recruit, and
invited him to lunch to discuss the matter quietly.
"You are very good," returned the other, "but I can assure you
I eat nothing before dinner. Won't you have a cigar?"
Mr. Ellebsdeb accepted the proffered kindness, and remarked
upon the excellent quality of the tobacco.
"Yes," assented his companion, "itis not half bad, for we get
all our supplies from the Stores; and now what can I do for yon f"
Then Mr. Ellebsdee unfolded his sad story. England was losing
her commercial prosperity, owing to a soaroity of labourers, artisans,
nay, even clerks. _ The Empire was in as bad a condition as those
foreign countries in which forced military service was established.
Like France and Germany, trade was being ruined by the Army,
Would not the young man desert, and become a recruit in the Labour
League?
"My dear friend," was the reply, "I hope I am as patriotic as
most people, but I cannot sacrifice my just interest entirely to senti-
ment. What can you give me in exchange for my present life P I
have recreation-rooms, libraries, polytechnics, and every sort of
amusement?"
"But also drill and discipline," urged the other.
"Which I am told by my medical attendant (whose services by the
way are gratuitous), are excellent for my health. This being so, I
oan scarcely complain of those institutions. Then I have excellent
pay and ample food. Now, I ask you frankly, can the advantages
offered by Trade oompare for a moment with the privileges, as a
soldier, I now eDjoy? Tell me frankly, shall I improve my position
by giving up the Army?
And Mr. Ellersdee was compelled to answer in the negative!
THE DIARY OF AN OLD JOKE.
[Posthumously Printed by kind Permission of Wit, Humour, <fc Co.,

April 1.—My birthday; have no idea whioh. Old as the hills,
but not quite bo pointed: venerable, but broken down, and used up;
not the Joke I used to be; once the rich darling of Society: but it
(Society) didn't pay, so had to work hard for a living. Tit Bits, the
National Observer, and the Chancery Judges, have impoverished me.
Never mind—I'll be revenged—resolve to keep a Diary—"weekly
diiry of a weakly "—oh dear! my old infirmity again. Must really
be more careful.
April 2.—In with the rest of them, for a (North-) Easter outing.
Hacking, in the train, tried to palm me off upon Hornblowbr. who
had actually the impudence to affect that he " couldn't '" —•" • ■«
if I hadn't obviously made his reputation for years I The best of
it is, that Hornblowbr is always airing me in public, and dropping
me in private. Blow Hornblowbr I
April 3.— Out to dinner. What a hypocrite Society is! Everyone
pretended never to have heard me before. I was allotted to Miss
Hornblowbr (worse luck 1), and she positively called me " Her own!"
—at my age, too! It's indecent. Complained to Hornblowbr,
who now faced round, and maintained that he was the first to bring
me out. I could almost have cried. No wonder I fell flat, and
injured myself. Why, Sir, Sidney Smith was my godfather, and
was always trotting me out as a prodigy, and trading on me. I sup-
ported him. Sir, when I was but an infant phenomenon ; I supported
him—but I can't support Hornblowbr.
April 4.—Went to the theatre, as I was told I figured in the'play;
claimed a free pass to the Stalls from the box-office boy, who was
rude; showed him my card; he looked scared, and said it was all
right. The actors were full of me: very gratifying; but everybody
laughed! Just like their oheek! There's nothing laughable.
I should fancy, about anything so played out as I've become. Ugh 1
how I detest irreverence! Hornblowbr and Hacking have both
written to the papers, maintaining that I belong to them, and that
the theatre has no right to have me impersonated on the Stage; they
term it" Thought Transference," "The Brain-Wave," or something
outlandish; and to think that Hacking, who reviews Hornblower's
effusions, once spoke of me as stale 1 They had better not try my
patienoe too far, I oan tell them.
April 5. — Sunday. Want change, and rest. Made for the
0'Wilde's sanctum. Cabman took the change, and 0' Wildb the
rest. Have known all the celebrities of the century, but like
O'W. the most. For one bo young, he's truly affable; made
me quite at home; promised to put me up—or in, I forget which;
and then he uttered this remarkable "preface"—"Jokes are
neither old nor young: they are simply mine or thine—that is all."
Nevertheless. I'm sure to be in his bad books before long.
April 6.—" Horrible outrage—an Old Joke, in trouble again "—bo
run the newspaper placards—was collared forcibly by two marked
ruffians in Grub Street, and dispatched post-haste to Punch offioe.
Mr. P., however, had known me from a boy, and was not to be im-
posed upon. He Bent me back promptly, on Her Majesty's Service,
warning me that, unless I went off, I should probably be knocked on
the head. Dear Evergreen Polictnbllo! but not so evergreen as
all that He knows my constitution won't stand these liberties. The
desperadoes turn out to be Hornblowbr and Hacking, as I suspected.
In defence they alleged I had struck them forcibly! Mr. P. vows he'll
proceed against them for nuisance—interfering with Anoient Lights.
April 7.—Very weak, from effects of yesterday. The heart taken
out of me. Consult my Doctor. To judge from the prints in his
waiting-room, I'm popular enough still with his patients. Says
I'm Buffering from a bad attack of Printer's Devils, but oan't make
me younger; replied that my desire was to be older. He looked
grave, and rejoined, " Impossible"; prescribed a course of Attic salts;
as I came out, met Sir Wilfrid Lawson. He declares I don't look
a day older than when he first knew me; but then, he's licensed to
be sober on the premises! Ab, how I love the House of Commons I
April 8.—Worn to a skeleton; sinking fast, but I '11 die hard.
Make my will. Bequeath Autographs of Talleyrand and Job
Miller to Madame Tussaud's; everything else to be sold for the
foundation of an Asylum for Old Jokes. A knook at the door.
Heaven help me!—two Interviewers I "Come in," I said, with the
conventional "oheery voice." Anticipated the worst, but worse than
I anticipated. Hornblowbr and Hacking are brooding over me;
assert they have been sent by the Lord Mayor. "Thought Trans-
ference" again! Well, I should have committed suioide, and now
I can be released without crime. It won't last long. If I might
suggest my obsequies, I should like to be cremated in Type.
Hacking begs my blessing, and pretends to weep at hearing the
last of me. Hope I shan't ever have to haunt Hornblowbr!
Editor's Postscript.—We have paid a pious visit to his last J eating-place;

I suppose the Meteor people think that witty. When I got home,
an awful thing happened. Mother, of oourse, wanted to see the
papers, so I gave her the Standard, with which she was much
pleased. She said it was evident I had made a wonderful impression,
and that the Billsbury Conservatives were particularly sensible
people! But, by some mistake, I left the Meteor lying on the drawing-
room table. It seems that, in the afternoon, that sharp-tongued old
hag. Mrs. Spigot, oalled. She saw the Meteor, took it up, and said,
"Dear me. is this something about your son P" Mother, thinking it
was the titandard, said, "Oh yes—do read it, Mrs. Spigot; it's a
wonderfully aoourate account, Richard says-" and that old cat
read it all through. She then smiled, and said, "Yes, very flatter-
ing indeed." After she had gone, mother took it up, and. to her
horror, found what it was. She was furious. When I got home in
the afternoon, I found her in a state of what Dr. Bakes calls
"extreme nervous excitement," with the Meteor lying in little
scraps all over the drawing-room, just as if a paper-chase had been
through there. She said, "Don't let me ever see that infamous
paper again, Dick. The man who wrote it owes you some grudge, of
course. Suoh a scoundrel ought to be denounced." I said I quite
agreed with her. Later on. met Vt/ixtamy at the Club. We spoke
about Billsbury. He asked me, with a tort of chuokle, if I 'd seen
the Star, and advised me to have a look at it, as there was something
about me in it. This is what I found in the oolumn headed "Mainly
About People": —
"Mr. Richard Pattije, who is to be the Conservative Candidate
for Billsbury at the next election, is a young man of twenty-six.
At Oxford he was generally oalled ' Podge Pattle' by his friends.
He took a fourth class in History. His oratorical efforts at the
Union were not very striking, but he rowed in his College Torpid,
which was bumped four times.
"Mr. Pattle, as may be inferred from his nickname, is neither
tall nor thin. He is a member of the Middle Temple, but his elo-
quence has not yet astonished the Courts of Law. His father died
five years ago, leaving him a considerable fortune, part of whioh he
proposes to waste in the hopeless attempt to turn out Sir Thomas
Chubson."
Confound the people, I wish they'd mind their own business and
leave me alone!
March 17.—Haven't been down to Billsbury again yet, but go the
day after to-morrow to speak at a Mass Meeting of Conservative
electors. However, I've had shoals of letters from the place —
nearly all of them asking for subscriptions. The Five Bars Cricket
Club, the Lilies Cricket Club, the Buffaloes Cricket Club, and the
Blue Horse Cricket Club have all elected me a vice-president, and
solicit the honour of my support. The Billsbury Free Dispensary is
muoh in want of funds, and the Secretary points out that Sir Thomas
Chubson has subscribed £5 regularly every year. The United
Ironmongers' Friendly Society wishes me to be an Honorary
Member. Chobson subscribes £2 2s. to them. The Billabury Brass
Band, and three Quoit Clubs (the game is muoh played there) have
elected me a member. The Secretary of the former sent me a printed
form, which I was to fill up, stating what instrument I meant to
play, and binding myself to attend at least one Band praotioe every
week. Three "oases of heartrending distress" have appealed to me,
"knowing the goodness of my heart." I shall have to consult
Tolland, or some one, about all this. I get the Meteor and the
Standard every day. The former goes on chaffing. Don't think
Jkrram, in the Standard, writes as smartly as the other chaps.
Must try to get him stirred up a bit. Just received letter from
Tolland, saying he wants to talk to me before meeting about
"matters connected with the Registration." More money, I suppose
Romeike, and all kinds of Press-Cutting Associations, keep on send-
ing me that extract from the Star, till I'm fairly sick of it. They
all want me to subscribe for Press-Cuttings. See them blowed first.

Mr. Keogstad, I have given you a seoret rendezvous in this room,
because it belongs to my employer, Mr. Helm be, who has lately
discharged you. The etiquette of Norway permits these slight

Mrs. L. Don't yon? 7 do. I am a widow—a Norwegian widow.
And it has occurred to me that there may be a nobler side to your
nature somewhere—though yon

Krogs. Right. I am a forger,

I have been blackmailing Mrs.
Helm eh by trading on her fears
like a low cowardly cur. Bnt, in
spite of all that — (clasping his
hands)—there are the makings of a
fine man about me yet, Christina!
Mrs. L. I believe yon—at least,

Mrs. L. How can yon think

but I can still see her faults, and
it is my firm opinion that a sharp

talked seriously together about serious things P
Helmer. Come, I do like that! How on earth could we talk about
serious things when your mouth was always full of macaroons P
Nora (shakes her head). Ah, Tobvald, the mouth of a mother of a
family should have more solemn things in it than macaroons! I see
that now, too late. No, yon have wronged me. So did Papa. Both

Nora. No more do I—that is what I have got to find out. If I had
been properly educated, I should have known better than to date
poor Papa's signature three days after he died. Now I must educate
myself. I have to gain experience, and get clear about religion, and
law, and things, and whether Society is right or I am—and I must go
away and never oome back any more till I am educated!
Helmer. Then you may be away some little time P And what's to
become of me and the eggs meanwhile P
Nora. That, Tobvald, is entirely your own affair. 1 have a higher
duty than that towards you and the eggs. (Looking solemnly upward.)
I mean my duty towards Myself!
Helmer. Ana all this because—in a momentary annoyance at
finding myself in the power of a discharged Cashier who calls me "I
say Tobvald," I expressed myself with ultra-Gilbertian frankness!
Yon talk like a silly child!
Nora. Because my eyes are opened, and I see my position with the
eyes of Ibsen. I must go away at onoe, and begin to educate myself.

The End {with Mr. Punch's apologies to the Master).
MODERN TYPES.
(By Mr. Punch's Own Type Writer.)
No. HIV.—THE GIVER OF PARTIES.
It may be that " Party." in the sense of a hospitable entertain-
ment, is an obsolete word, and that those who speak of " giving a
party" prove themselves, by the mere expression, to be fogeys whom
the rushing stream of London amusements has long
since thrown up on the sandy bank of middle age,
there to grow dull and forget that their legs were ever
apt for the waltz, or their digestions able to cope with
lobster mayonnaise at 2 a.m. Yet, though he who thus
speaks may not be as smart as a swell, or as muoh up
to date as a church-parade-goer, the expression will
serve, for it indicates comprehensively enough every
variety of entertainment known to the London Season
—the dance, the dinner, the reception, the music at
home, the tea-party, and the theatre-party, for all
these in her benevolence does the Giver of Parties offer
to us, and all these does she find the world of London
eager to accept. Now it would seem, one would
imagine, to be the easiest thing in the world,
if only the money be not wanting, to give a
party. A hostess, so someone may say, has
but to invite her friends, to light her rooms, to
spread her tables, to set the champagne flow-
ing, to order an awning, and to hire musio
and a linkman, and the thing is done. The
result of all this will no doubt be a party—
of a sort, but of a sort far different, however
gorgeous it may be, from the splendid and
widely- advertised gatherings which the genu-
ine Giver of Parties organises. For in the one
variety it is just possible that enjoyment may
be one of the main objects sought and at-
tained; in the latter it is certain that enjoy-
ment, though it is not always absent, must yield the precedence to
social success and promotion in the scale of Society. These are the
objects that the Giver of Parties, as it is proposed, to describe her,
has at heart, and to their attainment she devotes herself with a per-
sistent and all-embracing energy whioh no disappointment is capable
of daunting. The envy of her friends, the smiles and the presence
of Royalty, may be hers, but there is always some loftier height to
which she must climb before she can say to herself, "J'y suxe,j'y
reste," and be thankful.
Her life has known many changes. Her parents were county
people of good descent and position, but of a reduced income, for
which they apparently sought compensation in an increasing family,
mostly daughters. It was necessary that she should marry young,
and she submitted to necessity by accepting the proposal of a man
some ten years her senior, who had already come to be favourably
spoken off for the success of his commercial ventures. It is need-
less to add that all her relations took good care to impress upon her
mind the fact that the alliance was an honour to her husband, whose
wealth, even though it might in time rival that of the Rothschilds,
could never make him fit to be mentioned in the same breath with
one who numbered among her remoter ancestors a Baron, who had
fought and bled on many fields for King Charles the First.
However, the marriage took place in spite of the inequality of rank,
and the much-honoured husband bore his wife with him to London,
where for a time the modest comfort of a house in distant Bayswater
satisfied them. Business prospered, and money came pouring in.
The wife, who, it must be said, had undeniable beauty, excellent
manners, and the trick of intuitively adapting herself to any society,
was taken up by a great lady who happened to see her holding a
stall at a large bazaar in whioh the fashionable world took some
interest. Acting upon the great lady's suggestion, she was photo-
graphed in the becoming Tyrolese peasant's costume whioh she
wore as a stall-holder, and the photograph was in some mysterious
way engraved in all the illustrated papers of the following week.
Her name was enshrined in paragraphs, the was observed in the
Royal Enclosure at Ascot, she was introduced to a Royal personage
who was pleased to confer upon her the distinction of his smiles,
and to mention her to the select circle of his intimates as " a very
pretty, pleasant little woman." And thus she was started upon the
thorny path of ambitious pleasure.
It is well known that the sacred fire of fashion burns—or is
supposed to burn—in Belgravia alone. Its warmth drew
her irresistibly. Bayswater became too cold to hold her. and
early in the following year it was announced that a large
house in the purlieus of Grosvenor Square had been purchased
by her husband. However, she was content to climb by
degrees, and, in her first season of social brillianoy, she re-
stricted herself to a small and early dance, and a musical
evening. At the dance, universal admiration was excited by
the lavish profusion of the flowers with whioh her staircase
was adorned, by the excellent quality of the
champagne, and the inexhaustible supply of
oysters. At the musical evening the musio
was as admirably rendered as it was com-
pletely neglected. And at both parties only
those people were present as to whose social
status and absolute " Tightness " there could
be no question. Indeed the dancer, whose
foot had been trodden upon at the former,
might oonsole herself with the thought that
none but a noble boot had caused her pain;
while at the latter the sounds of heavy
breathing, whioh mingled inharmoniously
with Mile. Falsetti's irauura. were forgiven,
in consideration of the exalted rank of their
producer. Her success seemed now to be
assured, and even the muttered discontent of
a neglected husband, who was foolish enough
to prefer comfort to smartness, began to sub-
side. In the following year her entertain-
ments became even more splendid, and less comfortable. She took
a house at Asoot, and, triumph of triumphs! a scion of Royalty
deigned to accept her hospitality.
After this, one would have supposed that she might have reposed
for a space. But the penalty of social life is its never-ending
necessity for movement. Jealous rivals abound to dispute a hardly-
won supremacy, and the least sign of faltering may involve extinc-
tion. Yet it must be said that she is kind to her own, even when
she is most brilliant. She brings out a daughter to be the delight
of young Guardsmen, and marries her to a widowed Peer; she fnr-
bisnes up forgotten relations, and allows them to shine in the rayi
of her glory; she is charitable, after the manner of fancy fairs, and
the hospitality of her house becomes proverbial. But, in the midst
of all the bustle, the confusion, and the rattling turmoil of hei
career, she sometimes sighs for the undistinguished ease of her life ii
the pre-Royal days, sighs, and returns with fresh vigour to the struggle
And so the pleasureless days of the pleasure-seeker follow om
another, each with its particular legacy of little strivings, until, al
the last, consolation may come from the thought that there is at leas'
one place where there are many mansions, but no social ambitions.
New Prater-Book Revision.—Several alterations will now hav<
to be made in the marriage service. If it be permissible for th<
bride to omit her promise " to obey," as is reported to have been tin
oase at a wedding last week, why should any undertaking " to love,'
"to honour," "to cherish," and so forth remain in the text f VVitl
all this left out, a marriage, whioh, of course, will no longer be ai
eoolesiastioal rite, will hardly be a very civil ceremony. In coursi
of time all the promises will be made either explicitly or implioitl;
conditional, the only question being what is the least possible obliga
tion that can be inourred by both contracting parties at the smalles
possible

Q. And should Lord Monkbwell's Copyright Bill, which has

Q. But will not these advantages be purchased at the'prioe of a
loss to the general good?
A. Very likely—the community will suffer for the benefit of the
individual.
Q. In like manner a Patentee, who invents a most useful article,
enjoys (for a consideration) a monopoly of its sale, does he not f
A. For fourteen years. This enables him to recoup himself for
the thought and labour he has employed in the most useful article's

Q. If Author and Inventor were allowed an absolute monopoly of
the profits arising out of their brain-work, it would be immoral P
A. No doubt, as the individuals would benefit at theoost of the

Q. Why should a butterman, then, have an absolute right in the

OPERATIC NOTES.
The first night of the Mixed Italian Opera Season, 1891. We open
with Oluck's Orffo, and, in a strong opera-glass, we drink to
Drukiolanus Opebaticus, and say, "Here's G-luck t'you!"
Nothing can begin the season better than the appearance of Giclia
and Sofia Ravogli—specially Giulia—"There's
something 'bout Giulia So werry peonlia' "—{Old
Song)—in this short Opera, that is to say, an Opera
which should be
short were it not
for the "waits"
between the
Scenes and Acts,
which, as it is in
the nature of
weights to do,
must always make
even the lightest
0 pera seem heavy.
Mile. Giulia sang
and acted per-
fectly. Her ren-
dering of the last
song was most
pathetic This
delicious melody
the audienoe
would have had

again, not in
merry mood, for

sweet musio, but in appreciative sympathy with the woes of Orpheus
so sweetly expressed. The lines in Bombatte* rise in my memory:—
"So Orpheus sang of old, or poeti lie,
And"
On consideration, however, I will not quote the remainder, but
will say simply that we were all charmed. Welcome, at the com-
mencement of another season, to Mile. Bauerxeisteb, appearing as
Cupid, To-morrow she will be Dame Marta! Wonderful I "Time
cannot stale her infinite variety." How is it. 0 premiere danseuse,
my pretty pretty Polly Hop-kino Palladino, Principal Shade among
all these Happy but Shady characters, that thou didst not choose a
classic dance in keeping with the character of the music and of
the ideal—I distinctly emphasise "ideal"— surroundings f What
oughtest thou to represent in the Ely si an Fields? A Sal vat ionised
"Dancing Girl," without bonnet and tambourine? Nay, not so;
but rather the very Bpirit of classic grace and elegance, moving
rhythmically to melodious measure. In such a Scene as this ought
to be, we want as much idealism as your graceful art can lend,
otherwise we are only
among our old friends,
"the ladies and gen
tleraen of the Chorus"
—bless em 1 — repre-
senting most Bubstan
tially the "Shades of
the Blessed." who
appear to be Shades of
every colour. Giulia
Kavogli, however,
kept us entranced in
the ancient classic land
where once we used to
wander. "f ive Lem
priere!"
Second Night.—
Faust, with a new
Marguerite. Gay dog,
Faust. How many
Marguerite* have
there been even in my
time! Same old story.
Faust not a whit im-
proved by experience
—going on just the

aoting over the inert body of Valentine, when she attempts no
sudden Colwell-Hatohney shriek, always so perilous. Signor Pbrotti
looked as Faust might have done, had he been eleoted an Alderman
of the City of London and aoted up to the character. If Drurio-
LASU8 had lent him his Sheriff's ohain to wear, Signor Pkhotti
would have been perfect, that is from this point of view. M. Maubsl
excellent as Mephisto in a new suit of clothes. He appears now as
"The Gentleman in Grey "—rather suggestive of his having become
a Volunteer, and a member, of oourse, of "the Devil's Own."
Imagine Mephistopheles re-dressed at last 1 On both nights Signor
Mahclnxlli, the Conduotor, seemed pleased, and that's something.
Great feature in Covent Garden this year is the decoration of the
Pit-tier Lobby. Dbubiolasus, feeling happy at the Opera prospects,
and rejoioing in a foil subscription, said to the
Committee, "Gentlemen, let's have 'glasses
round' I" Some offioions person, hearing this,
mistook the meaning of the great Chief, and
straightway ran off and ordered looking-glasses
all round for the Lobby! Grand effect! bril-
liant I dazzling I—too muoh so, in fact; several
glasses too muoh. So, after a couple
of nights' reflection, when the habitue's
came on Thursday, behold, two or
three of the aristocratic mirrors or
Peer-glasses had disappeared, the
hat-pegs of former times had been
restored, the wounded susceptibili-
ties of the Stall-keepers whose occu-
pation was partly gone, were healed,
and where gloom was spreading, wreathed
smiles once more prevailed. Even now these
Opera-glasses are rather too powerful. Still, "let
us see ourselves as others see us," is a good
praotioal motto for the loiterer in the lobby, as he
oatches sight of himself, en passant, and wonders
who that chap is, whose face he has seen some-
where before, but whose name he can't for the
life of him recollect. ,
Thursday.—Carmen. Disappointed with Julia mlxtuJ? 2fthUenr?
Ravogli in this, though there are some fine bits Jf'i0I1„i'jf—ih
of acting in it. Didn't care muoh about Sister 0
Sofia as Mickie the Maiden. M. Lubbbt's Don Jose good but not
great; and M. Celli, who, in default of M. Devoyod's not being able
to appear, took the part of EscamiUo, was great, but not very good.
He was, however, well supported by Signor Kandeggbk and the
Orchestra, and considering the difficulties he had to struggle with,
inoluding an apology in the bills, he came out of it safely.
Saturday.—Re-appearanee of the great Db Reszke Brothers, John
and Ned (what's John without an 'ed f) in Lohengrin. Admirable.
Jclii Ravogli excellent as Ortruda, and M. Maubel equally so as
Freddy. But why did he "feather his skull," like the Jolly Young
Waterman, in so remarkable a style? However, his Freddy is a
feather in his cap with which he ought to be satisfied. Miss Eames
as Elsa even better than as Marguerite, Crammed house. '' Friends
in front" more than satisfied. Good start.
Talking about Marguerite behind her Back;
or, "' Tails' out of School."
e as ever. His new Marguerite does credit to his ohoioe, for
ikes—(isn't she Miss Eames, and neither Mademoiselle nor
t And doesn't she hail from Columbia f—but no matter)—
a sweet-looking Marguerite, with a voioe as true as is her heart
Faust. A genuine Oretehen, simple not brilliant Brilliancy she
to property diamonds, but awakes enthusiasm, by her judioious

SWORD VERSUS LANCET!
(An incident in the next War.)
"Now," said the Surgeon-Field-Marshal-Command-
ing -in-Chief, as he stood before his men; "I have the
greatest confidence in your skill. There is not one of
you present who cannot perform an operation as success-
fully as myself;" here there was a murmur of polite
denial in the ranks. "Nay, it is no flattery—I mean it
These are my last instructions. We are few, the enemy
are many. We are not only'soldiers but medical men.
And as medical men it is our business to cure the wounds
that we infliot in our more strictly military capacity."
Again there was a murmur—this time of cordial approval.
"Well, Gentlemen, as we have been taught in our drill,
what the first rank breaks, the rear rank must bandage
up. This would be all very well if our numbers were
told by thousands, or even hundreds, instead of tens.
But to-day we must use the bayonet rather than the
lanoet, the bullet in preference to the pill." Stealthy
applause followed this observation. "But be careful.
Common humanity calls upon us to do as little damage
as possible. You know your anatomy sufficiently well
to avoid inflicting a wound upon a vital part, and can
so arrange that your blows shall incapacitate rather
than funotionally derange. And now, my friends, put
your instrument-boxes and pharmacopoeias in your
haversacks, and draw your swords. All ready P Yes!
Then, * Up, Guards, and at them I'"
With a wild oheer the Royal Regiment of Physicians
and Surgeons (which had recently been admitted into the
Service on the footing of the Royal Engineers) rushed
forward. It was a beautiful sight to see them performing
the most delicate operations in the kindest manner
imaginable. The'enemy trembled, wavered, and fled.
In a moment the Royal Regiment had put up their swords
and taken out their medical appliances. Their military
duties done,' and they were doctors onoe .again, ready to
help those who demanded their ecmi-civilian services.
They had scarcely been engaged in this manner ten
minutes when the Surgeon-Field-Marshal-Commanding-
in-Chief cantered up to them. "Men," he cried, "drop
your surgical instruments, and draw your swords. The
tnemy are again upon us 1 We must take their fort I"
In a moment the Royal Regiment was on the march.
On their way, some of their comrades, wounded by the foe
(in a bungling fashion), appealed to them for succour.
"Very sorry," replied the Surgeon-Field-Marshal-
Commanding-in- Chief, in a tone of commiseration; "very sorry
indeed, but we can't attend to you. At this moment we are acting
in our strictly military capacity!" And the Royal Regiment
of Physicians and Surgeons, full of enthusiasm (but in rather loose
formation) continued weir march to thv fort.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Tourmalin'* Time Cheque*, drawn on the bank of eccentric
imagination by Anstet-Guthrie, is well worthy of the author of
Vice Verti. The oonstruotion of the story is as artful as it is
artistic but the Baron cannot give his
reason for this opinion without jeopar-
dising the reader's pleasure. Still the
Baron feels pretty certain that when
the muoh-amused and greatly-chuck-
ling but diligent ana conscientious
peruser of this light-hearted romance
arrives at the last few pages, he will
frown, rub his eyes, refer back to the
^_>1 I M w . very commencement of the story,—and
■^Vst then? Will he bless Anstet and blow
•=■■»■* 'pp Guthrie, or bless Guthrie and blow
Anstky, or will he, being more tickled
than ever, rush off to recommend it at
onoe to his best friends.'antioipating renewed delight from their
pleasure and perplexity? The Baron wishes that Anstet and Guthrie
had settled between them to call it Tourmalin'* Time Bargain!; but
it is very likely that if Anstet suggested it, Guthrie rejected it,
or, if the Baron may be permitted to say so without infringement
of copyright, "vice vena." It is a great satisfaction to know that
unlike the Erckmann-Chatrjan collaboration, the Anstet-Guthrie
partnership cannot be dissolved. Jekyl-and-Hydk can oease to be,
and Jektl may alone survive; but the Baron rejoices in the fact of
the mysterious bond between Anstet and Guthrie being indissoluble.
Read Tourmalin's Time Cheque!, and remember the prognostications of
The Baron de Book-Works.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FBOM THE DIAEY OF TOBY, M.P.
Howe of Commom, Monday, April 6.—School reopened after
Easter Holidays. Old Morality duly in his plaoe, but not many
of the boys. Civil Service Estimates on; Plunkkt in charge on
Ministerial side; Sage of Queen Anne's Gate Leader of Oppo-
sition. Hammered away all night on old familiar lines. Ghosts of
old acquaintances feebly crossed floor, disappearing behind Speaker's
chair. Kensington Palace, with its cost; Bushey House; Cambridge
Cottage; admission to Holyrood Palace; the deer in Home Park at
Hampton Court: the pheasants in Richmond Park; the frescoes
in House of Lords; the Grille of the Ladies' Gallery: the British
Consular House at Cairo— each came up in turn; talked about; pro-
tested against; explained; divided upon, and voted. Plunkkt left
to himself on Treasury Benoh; bore up with unflagging energy and
perennial patienoe; has heard same points raised every year since he
was First Commissioner; has made same replies, and has seen Votes
passed. Long before he was in office same thing used to go on with
other First Commissioners. That was before the Sage had taken to
S)litics. Good old Rtlands—" Preposterous Peter "—was then the
rand Inquisitor. But it was the same deer, the same gas-bills, the
same question of free residenoe for " that eminent warrior," as the
Sage to-night called him, the Dook of Cambridge.
Oddly enough, almost only flash of humour through long sitting
came from George Campbell. Gave graphic description of his
hanging about Holyrood Palace hankering after admission. Accord-
ing to existing regulation, admission to be gained only after bang
goes two saxpenoes. For sixteen years Sir George ever lured
to vicinity; sometimes casually entered doorway, proposing to loiter
past ticket-collector; stopped by demand of a shilling, had resisted
temptation. That was sad, but what he felt most aoutely was
injury done to his nation. Americans visiting Edinburgh on their
way to Paris went to Holyrood: charged a shilling. Hal ha I"
they cried, "see these stingy Scotchmen. They charge a shilling
before they throw open their one Palace door, whilst in
you may roam through the Palaces free of oharge."

"Another cigarette."
"Sir," oried Sir Geobge, his voice under generous exoitement of
the moment taking on rasping tone, "the arrangement is prejudicial
to the reputation of Scotchmen."
"This," said the Sage, "will. I think, he an
opportunity of going outfor another cigarette."
Business done. — Handsful of Votes in
Supply.
Tuesday^— Napoleon B. Bolton strolled
down to House to-night, intending to hear
what Tomlinson had to say on Emigration
arrangements. In family circle it has always
been considered that, as far as personal re-
semblance to Napoleon Bonaparte goes, the
late Prince Jerome wasn't in it with the
Member for St. Panoras. Bolton blushingly
pooh-poohs the fond little fancy; but he is of
kindly disposition; not inclined to insist on
his opinion in controversy to other people's.
Indeed, has gone so far as to furnish him-
self with fancy dress, fashioned on the style
of that worn by the great Napoleon on State
oocasions. To-night, been at a children's
party, showing himself in his uniform. Am
told that, when be folds his arms, throws back
his head, and recites, "On Linden, when the
sun was low," you would think the Qreat
Emperor had come back from St. Helena.
Intended to-night to create sensation in
House. Doubted whether, as he was not about
to move the Address, he would be permitted to
enter with sword by his side. But he would be free of the smoke-
room; might posture in the Lobby; might read an evening paper in
the tea-room, whilst others enviously glanced at his epaulettes.
Here he was at ten minutes past nine standing in his favourite
attitude at the Bar, no one having challenged his entrance. Fact
is, House was up; not Counted Out, but having duly gone through
the Orders and passed the Second Reading of an important measure.
Such a day the Government had had! At Morning Sitting had
ramped through the Orders, advanoing Bill after Bill through critical
stages. House nearly em tit y; Opposition effaced; Irish Members
all absent exoept Brer Rabbit, who wanders about looking for
Brer Fox. The only note of discord sounded in voioe of Geobge
Cahpbell. Report of Supply reached at a quarter to seven. At
ten minutes to seven, in accordance with Rule ordering Morning
Sitting, Debate must stop. One or two
questions asked; quiokly answered
by Plunket; Vote after Vote agreed
to on report stage. Then Cahpbell
gets up and wants to know about
lighting the National History Museum
at night F
Twelve minutes to seven.
Plunket looks anxiously at clock.
If Campbell would put his question
and sit down he might be answered,
and report stage got through. But
Campbell goes on till hand of clock
points to ten minutes to seven.
"Order, order!" cries Speaker.
Time limit reached; no more debate;
Campbell not finished yet; attempt-
to proceed; angry shouts of "Order!
Order 1 " before whioh he subsides.
Then, witching opportunity, sud-
denly bolts up again and wants to
explain that he was not opposing the
passage of report stage of Supply.
No, but you talked it out," said
Plonkkt, with something less than
his customary suavity.
This happened more than two hours
ago. There has been the suspension
of the Sitting, the resumption at nine
o'clock, the Second Reading of the Rating of Machinery Bill; and
now all is over, the guests are fled, the garlands dead, and all but
Napolvon B. Bolton departed. He, in faot, has only just arrived,
and wishes he had not been in such a hurry to quit the circle where
of late he was the object of awed admiration.
Business done.—Trenormous I
Thursday.—House filled up to-night; flowing tide evidently with
us, including Mr G., baok after his holidays. Also Prinoe Arthur;
been in training for Borne weeks in anticipation of long spurt in Com-
mittee on Irish Land Bill. Irish Members also returned in consider-
able force. Expected to find Tim Healy arrive in fragments; but
he's all there, much as usual.

"How's Brer Koxr" I asked him, wishing to hear latest
from Ireland.
"Oh," said he, "Pabnell's looking up."
"What do you mean f" I asked, astonished at this testimony.
"I mean, he's on his baok, and, being in that position, must of
course be looking up, if he's looking anywhere at all."
Light-hearted Tim! Time does not wither, or Dalton O'Brlkx
stale, his infinite variety.
Scotch Members on before Ireland was approached. Something about
the Scotch Private Bill Procedure Bill. Formidable List of Amend-
ments to Lord-Advocate's proposal to nominate Committee. All
the Clans muster. No var moves Amendment; Campbell-Banner-
man objeoted that thirteen Scotch Members, including Leng and
Lyon Platfaxk, "would not make an adequate Committee." Robert-
son brought against the Lord-Advocate the grave charge that he
was " interpolating an extraneous and alien body into this business."
Lord Kingsbury, ex-Lord-Advocate
happened to be under Gallery on chance
visit to House. Heard this remark with
huge delight. Reminded him of the times
when he used to sit through long nights
with back fairly set against the Gang-
way post of Treasury Benoh, invoking
blessings on head of Duke of Argyll,
and driving the Liberal Scotch Members
wild with his perpetual smile of content.
Business done.—Committee on Irish
Land Bill started.
Friday Night.—When House met at
Morning Sitting Old Morality discovered
on Treasury Benoh, looking more than
usually guileless. Been badgered all week
about Labour Committee. When going
to disclose names of Commissioners and
set forth terms of reference? Only yes-
terday Brer Rabbit put the question,
intimating that whenever the announce-
ment was made Adjournment of House
would be moved in order to protest
against omission of Davitt's name. Old
Mobalitt answering, said it was pos-
sible he might be able to make the an-
nouncement to-day, but much more
likely on Monday.
Everyone thought it would be Monday.
Brer Rabbit in his plaoe to-day, but his
men absent. Old Mobalitt, with posi-
tively a halo of innooenoy round his head, suddenly appeared at
table: read out the list of Commissioners. Brer Rabbit's hand
forced; must needs forthwith ask leave to move the Adjournment.
"Got your forty men f" asked the Speaker.
"Not quite," said Brer Rabbit, apologetically.
Only twenty-nine; so Brer Rabbit bowled out, and opportunity
lost.
"Dear me!" said Old Morality; "how very unfortunate. Now if
I'd only waited till Monday. House would have been quite full; Brer
Rabbit would have got his forty men twice over; we should have had
an embarrassing Debate, and lost several hours of the sitting. As

MR. PUNCH'S POCKET IBSEN.
[Condensed and Revised Version by Mr P.'s Own Harmless IbseniU.)
No. III.-HEDDA GABLER.
Act I.
Scene—A Sitting-room cheerfully decorated in dark colours. Broad
doorway, hung with black crape, in the wall at back, leading to a
back Drawing-room, in which, above a sofa in black horsehair,
hangs a posthumous portrait of the late General G a bler. On the
piano is a handsome pall. Through the glass panes of the back
Drawing-room window are seen a dead wall and a cemetery.
Settees, sofas, chairs, Src handsomely upholstered in black
bombazine, and studded with small round nails. Bouquets of
immortelles and dead grasses are lying everywhere about.
Enter Aunt Julie (a good-natured looking lady in a smart hat).
Aunt J. Well, 1 declare, if I believe George or H edd a are up yet!
(Enter George Tfsmax, humming, stout, careless, spectacled.) Ah,
my dear boy, I have called before breakfast to inquire how you and
Hedda are after returning late last night from your long honeymoon.
Oh, dear me, yes; am I not your old Aunt, and are not these atten-
tions usual in Norway?
Oeorge. Good Lord, yes! My six months'honeymoon has been quite
a little travelling soholarthip, eh P I have
been examining archives. Think of that! Look
here, I'm going to write a book all about the
domestio interests of the Cave-dwellers during
the Deluge. I'm a clever young Norwegian
man of letters, eh?
Aunt J. Fanoy your knowing about that
too 1 Now, dear me, thank Heaven!
George. Let me, as a dutiful Norwegian
nephew, untie that smart, showy hat of yours.
(Unties it, and pats her under the chin.) Well,
to be sure, you have got yourself really up,—
fanoy that!
[He puts hat on chair close to table.
Aunt J. {giggling). It was for Hedda'b sake
—to go out walking with her in. (Hedda
approaches from the back-room: she is pallid,
with cold, open, steel-grey eyes; her hair is not
very thick, but what there is of it is an agree-
able medium brown.) Ah, dear Hedda!
[She attempts to cuddle her.
Hedda (shrinking back). Ugh, let me go, do 1
(Looking at Aunt Julie's hat.) Teshah, you
must really tell the housemaid not to leave
her old hat about on the drawing-room chairs.
Oh, is it your hat? Sorry I spoke, I'm sure 1
Aunt J. (annoyed). Good gracious, little
Mrs. Hedda.; my nice new hat that I bought to
go out walking with you in 1
George (patting her on the back). Yes,
Hedda, she did, and the parasol too! Fancy, sffl8^ J\^.
Aunt Julie always positively thinks of every- _ „
thing, eh ?" I am a gay Norwegian dog."
Hedda (coldly). You hold your tongue. Catch me going out
walking with your aunt! One doesn't do such things.
George (beaming). Isn't she a charming woman? Suoh fascinating
manners 1 My goodness, eh P Fanoy that!
Aunt J. A h, dear George, you ought indeed to be happy—but (brings
out a fiat package wrapped in newspaper) look here, my dear boy 1
George (opens it). What ? my dear old morning shoes I my slippers!
(Breaks down.) This is positively too touching, Hedda, ehf Do you
remember how badly I wanted them all the honeymoon P Come and
just have a look at them—you may!
Hedda. Bother your old slippers and your old aunt too I _ (Aunt
Julie goes out annoyed, followed by George, still thanking her
warmly for the slippers; Hedda yawns; George comes back and
places his old slippers reverently on the table.) Why, here oomes Mrs.
Elvsted—another early caller! She had irritating hair, and went
about making a sensation with it—an old flame of yours, I've heard.

Hedda. George, go and write an invitation at once; do you hear P
(George looks around for his slippers, takes them up and goes out.)
Now we can talk, my little Thea. Do you remember how I used
to pull your hair when we met on the stairs, and say I would scorch
it off P Seeing people with copious hair always does irritate me.
Mrs. E. Goodness, yes, you were always so playful and friendly,
and I was so afraid of you. I am still. And please, I've run away
from my husband. Everything around him was distasteful to me.
And Mr. Lovborg and I were comrades—he was dissipated, and I
got a sort of power over him, and he made a real person out of me—
whioh I wasn t before, you know; but, oh, I do hope I'm real now.
He talked to me and taught me to think—chiefly of him. So, when
Mr. Lovborg came here, naturally I came too. There was nothing
else to do! And fanoy, there is another woman whose shadow still
stands between him and mel She wanted to shoot him once, and
so, of course, he can never forget her. I wish I knew her name—
perhaps it was that red-haired opera-singer P
Hedda (with cold self-command). Very likely—but nobody does
that sort of thing here. Hush! Run away now. Here oomes
Tesman with Judge Brack. (Mrs. E. goes out; George comes in
with Judge Brack, who is a short ana elastic gentleman, with a
round face, carefully brushed hair, and distinguished profile.) How
awfully funny you do look by daylight, Judge!
Brack (holding his hat and dropping his eye-glass). Sinoerest
thanks. Still the same graceful manners, dear
little Mrs. Hed—Tesman! I came to invite
dear Tesman to a little bachelor-party to cele-
brate his return from his long honeymoon. It
is customary in Scandinavian Fooiety. _ It will
be a lively affair, for I am a gay Norwegian dog.
George. Asked out — without my wife I
Think of that! EhP Oh, dear me, yes, 2'11
come!
Brack. By the way, Lovborg is here; he has
written a wonderful book, whioh has made a
sensation. Bless me, yes!
Enter Mrs, Elvsted; she is pretty and gentle, with coj
hair and round prominent eyes, and the manner of
copious wavy
while-gold hair an'
a frightened rabbit.
Mrs. E. (nervous). Oh, please, I'm so perfectly in despair.
Ejlert Lovborg, you know, who was our Tutor; he written suoh

correspondent, a full and enthusiastic ac-
count of it, but that I was bothered all the
time by two persons near me, who would talk
and wouldn't listen. Thank goodness, they
didn't stay throughout the performance. In
a theatre they'd have been hushed down, but
this is such a big plaoe that a talking duet
is heard only in the immediate neighbour-
hood of the talkers; and then no one wants
to have a row during the performance of
saored music It '■ like brawling in churoh.
QUEER QUERIES.
Thb Titers Question.—I am the Vioar of
a country Churoh in Wales; but owing to
the total failure of my last attempt _ to
distrain on the stock of a neighbouring
farmer, on whioh occasion I was tossed over
a hedge by an infuriated oow, my family and
myself are starving. I wish to know if I
can legally pawn the lectern, the anoient
carved pulpit, and several rare old sedilia in
the Churoh P Or they would be exchanged
for an immediate supply of their value in
groceries. —Urgent.
Annoyance from Neighbour.—I live in'a
quiet street, and my next-door neighbour has
suddenly converted his house into a Fried Fish
Shop. Some of his boxes protrude into my
front garden. Have I the right of seizingthem,
and eating contents, supposing them to be fit
for human consumption F My house is per-
petually filled with the aroma of questionable
herrings, and very pronounced haddocks. I
have asked, politely, for compensation, and
received only bad language. What should
be my next step ?—Perplexed.
Deed of Gut. —Upon my eldest son's
marriage I wish to make him a really hand-
some money present. My idea is to hand
over to him £100, on condition that he repays
me ten per cent, as long as I live, my age now
being forty-five. Then as to security. Had
I better get a Bill of Sale on the furniture,
which he has just had given him by his wife's
father for their new house, or how oan I most
effectually bind him ?— Generous Parent.
Holiday Trip.—Would one of your readers
inform me of a locality where I can take my
next summer's holiday of a month, for £3 10»..
fare included? It must be near the sea and
high mountains, with a genial though bracing
olimate. Good boating and bathing. Strictly
honest lodging-house keepers and romantic
surroundingsindispensable.— Easy to Please.
COMING DRESS.

Reformers at the Kensington Town Hall.)
Vainly on Fashion you make war,
With querulous Book, and quaint Bazaar,
Good Ladies of the Higher Light!
A Turkish Tea-gown, loose or tight,
Won't win us to the Rational Colt;

No more than satire, whioh reproves us
Ad nauseam, and for whose rebuff
We never care one pinch of snuff.
No, Ladies Habberton and Coffin,
Your pleading, like the critics' '' socffin
Touches us not; have we not smiled,

MODERN TYPES.
{By Mr. Punch's Own Type Writer.)
No. XXY.-THE ADULATED CLERGYMAN.
The Adulated Clergyman possesses many of the genuine qualities
of the domestio oat, in addition to a large stock of the characteristics
which tradition has erroneously assigned to that humble but mis-
understood animal. Like a oat, he is generally sleek and has become
an adept in the art of ingratiating himself with those who wear
skirts and dispense comforts. Like a cat, too, he has an insinuating
manner; he can purr quite admirably in luxurious surroundings,
and, on the whole, he prefers to attain his objects by a circuitous
method rather than by the bluff and uncompromising directness
whioh is employed by dogs and ordinary honest folk of the canine
sort. Moreover, he likes a home, but—here comes the difference—
the homes of others seem to attraot and retain him more strongly
than his own. And if it were useful to set out the points of differ-
ence in greater detail, it might be said that the genuine as opposed
to the traditional oat often shows true affection and quite a dignified
resentment of snubs, is never unduly familiar, and makes no pretence
of being better than other oats whose coats happen to be of a different
oolour. But it is better, perhaps, at onoe to consider the Adulated
Clergyman in his own person, and not in his points of resemblance to
or difference from other animals.
He who afterwards beoomes an Adulated Clergyman has probably
been a mean and grubby schoolboy, with a wretched but irresistible
inclination to sneak, and to defend himself for so
doing on principle. It is of course wrong to
break rules at school, authority must be respected,
masters must be obeyed, but it is an honourable
tradition amongst schoolboys that boys who offend
—since offences must oome— should owe their con-
sequent punishment to the unassisted efforts of
those who hold rule, rather than to the calcu-
lating interference of another boy, who, though
he may have shared the offence, is unwilling to
take his proportion of the result. A sneak, there-
fore, has in all ages been invested with a badge of
infamy, whioh no amount of strictly scholastio I
suooess has ever availed to remove from him;
and his fellows, reoognising that he has saved his
own skin at the expense of theirs, do their best rj J
to make up the difference to him in contempt and
abuse. Sohoolboys are not distinguished for a \m
fastidious retioence. If they dislike, they never
hesitate to say so, and they have a painfully J
downright way of giving reasons for their be- >{; i
haviour, whioh is apt to jar on a temperament >. k
so sensitive that its owner always and only treads i ^
the path of high prinoiple when self-interest
points him in the same direction.
The school career of the future pastor was not, therefore, a very
happy one, for at school there are no feeble women to be captivated
by heartrending revelations of a noble nature at war with universal
wickedness, and all but shattered by the assaults of an unfeeling
world. Nor, strange to say, do schoolmasters, as a rule, value the boy
who ranges himself on their side in the eternal war between boys and
masters. However, he proceeded in due time to a University. There
he let it be known that his ultimate destination was the Church, but
he had his own method of qualifying for his profession. He was not
afflicted with the possession of great muscular strength, or of a very
robust health. Neither the river nor the football-field attracted him.
Cricket was a bore, athletio sports were a burden: the rough
manners of the ordinary Undergraduates made him shudder. How-
ever, since at College there are sets of all sorts and sizes, he soon
managed to fashion for himself a little world of effete and mincing
idlers, who adored themselves even more than they worshipped one
another. They drank deep from the well of modern French litera-
ture, and chattered interminably of Richepin, Gur be Maupassant,
Paul Bouhokt, and the rest. They themselves were their own
favourite native writers; but their morbid sonnets, their love-lorn
elegies, their versified mixtures of passion and a quasi-religious
mysticism, were too sacred for print, though they were sometimes
adapted to thin and fluttering airs, and sung to sympathisers in
private. Most of these gentlemen were "ploughed " in their ex-
amination, but the hero of this sketch secured nis degree without
honours, and departed to read for the Church.
Soon afterwards he was ordained, was plunged ruthlessly into an
East-End parish, and disappeared for a time from view. He
emerged, after an interval of several years. The occasion was the
inaugural meeting of a Guild for the Conversion of Music-hall
Artistes, whioh is to this day spoken of amongst the irreverent as
the Song and Sermon Society. The sensation of the meeting was
caused by the fervent speech of a clergyman, who announced that he
himself had been for some months a professional Variety Singer,
attaohed to more than one Music-hall, and that, having studied the
life de pres, he knew all its temptations, and was therefore qualified
to speak from experience as to the best means of elevating those who
pursued it. The details of his story, as they fell from the mouth of
the reverend speaker, were highly spioed. His hearers were amused,
interested, ana stirred; and, when a daily newspaper gave a head-
lined account of the speeoh, with a portrait of the speaker, the
professional fortune of the Adulated Clergyman (for it was he) was
assured.
Shortly afterwards his biography appeared in a series published
in a weekly periodical under the title of Unconventional Cleric*.
and he himself wrote a touching letter on "The Plague Spots of
Nova Zembla," in whioh an eloquent appeal was made for sub-
scriptions on behalf of the inhabitants of that chill and neglected
region. Ladies now began to say to one another: "Have you
heard Mr. So-and-So preaoh? Really, not? Oh, you should. He's
so wonderful, so convincing, so unlike all others. You must oome
with me next Sunday," and thus gradually he gathered round him
in his remote ohuroh a band of faithful women, drawn from the
West End by the fame of his unoonventional eloquence. A not too
fastidious oritio might, perhaps, have been startled by a note of
vulgarity in his references to sacred events, as well as by the tone
of easy and intimate familiarity with whioh he spoke of those whose
names are generally mentioned with bated breath, and printed with
capital letters; but the most refined women seemed to find in all this
an additional fasoination. His sermons dealt in (language which
was at the same time plain and highly-coloured. He denounced his
congregation roundly as the meanest of sinners.
To the women he was particularly merciless. He
tore to rags their little vesture of self-respect,
shattered their nerves with emotional appeals,
harrowed all their feelings, and belaboured them
so violently with prophecies of wrath, that they
left ohuroh, after shedding gallons of tears and
emptying their expiatory purses into the sub-
scription-plate, in a state of pale but pious pulp.
In the drawing-rooms, however, to whioh he
afterwards resorted, his manner changed. His
voice became soft; he poured oil into the wounds
he had inflicted. "How are you to-day P" he
would say, in his caressing way. Is '.the
neuralgia any better? And the dulness of
spirits r has meditation prevailed over it F Ah
me 1 it is the lot of the good to suffer, and silence,
perhaps, were best." Whereupon he is treated
as a Father Confessor of domestio troubles, and
ersuades young married women that their hus-
ands misunderstand them.
_ It is unnecessary to add that his subscription-
lists flourished, his bazaars prospered, his missions
and retreats overflowed with feminine money, and
his Church was overloaded with floral tributes.
The brutal tribe of men, however, sneered at him, and perversely
suspected his motives; nor were they reconciled to him when they saw
him relieving the gloom of a generally (so it was understood) aecetio
existence by dining at a smart restaurant with a galaxy of devoted
women, whom he proposed to conduct in person to a theatre. Suoh,
then, is, or was, the Adulated Clergyman. It is unnecessary to
pursue his oareer further. Perhaps he quarrelled with his Bishop,
and unfrocked himself; possibly he found himself in a Court of Law,
where an unsympathetic jury recorded a painful verdiot against him.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Mr faithful "Co." says he has been reading the latest novel by
"Johw Strange Winter," called, The Other Man's Wife, as the
French would observe, "without pleasure." As a rule he rather
enjoys the works of the Author of Bootle's Baby, and other stories of a
semi-ladylike semi-military character; but the newest tale is one too
many for him. The "man" is a mixture of snob and oad,—say "a
enad,"—the "other man" a combination of coward and bully, the
"wife" a worthy mate to both of them. The plot shows traces of hasty
construction, otherwise it is difficult to account for the "man's" in-
tense astonishment at inheriting a title from his cousin, and the far-
fetched clearing up of a sensational West-End murder. My "Co."
fancies that the peerage given to the "man," and the vendetta of
the Polish Countess, both introduced rather late in Vol. II., must
have been after-thoughts. However, the end of the story is both
novel and entertaining. The feeble, fickle heroine is made to
marry, as her second husband, the man who (as an accessory after
the f aot) has been the murderer of her first! And the best of the
joke is—she does not know it 1 My "Co." has also been much
amused by a brightly-written Novel, in one volume, called A Bride
from the Bush. Mr. E. W. Hoenuno evidently knows his subject
well, and has caught the exact tone, or rather nasal twang of our

Australian cousins. My "Co." says that "the Bride" is a par-
ticularly pleasant young person, thanks to her youth, good heart,
and beauty. However, it is questionable—taking her as a sample—
whether her "people" would "pan out" quite so satisfactorily.
On the whole it would seem that Australians who have "made
their pile" by buying and selling land are better at a distance—say
as Aborigines!
It is also the opinion of my faithful "Co." that the Clarendon
Press series of Rulers of India, has never contained a better volume
than the Lift of Mayo,*, work recently contributed by the Editor,
Sir William Wilson Hunter. Admirably written, the book gives
in the pleasantest form imaginable, a most eventful chapter in the
History of Hindostan. But more, the pages have a pathetic personal
interest, as the subject of the memoir was for many years misunder-
stood, and consequently, misrepresented. Even the London Charivari
was unfair to the great Earl, but as Sir "Williah hastens to say, " at
his death'st ood first in its generous acknowledgment of his real dessert,
as it had led the dropping fire of raillery three years before." The
author has, by publishing this most welcome addition to a capitally
edited series, added yet another item to the long list of services he
has Tendered to our Empire in the distant East.
Since Miss Florence Warden's House on the Marsh, says the
Baron, I have not read a more exciting tale than the same authoress's
Pretty Miss Smith. It should be swallowed right off at a sitting,
for if your interest in it is allowed to cool during an interval, you
may find it a little difficult to get up the steam to the high-pressure
point necessary for the real enjoyment of a sensational story.
The Bason de Book-Wobms.
SILENT SHAKSPEARE.
Dear Ms. Editor,
Thb great success that has attended the production of
V Enfant Prodigue at the Prince of Wales's Theatre has encouraged
me to make a suggestion in the cause of English Art. Why not
Shakspeare in dumb show? The Bard himself introduced it in " The
Play Soene." Allow me to suggest it thus :—
Scene—A more remote part of the Platform in Elsinore Castle.
Enter Ghost; then Hamlet.
Hamlet (in dumb show). "Where wilt thou lead me? Speak!"
(In dumb show.)_ "I '11 go no further."
Ghost, by kissing his hand towards the horizon, shows that his hour
is almost come, when he is bound to render himself to sulphurous and
tormenting flames. The latter part of his description is composed of
his shrinking about the stage, as if suffering from intense heat.
Hamlet buries his face tn his hands, and sobs pitifully, expressing
"Alas, poor Ghost I'1
Ghost repudiates compassion by turning up his nose, and throwing
forward his hands; and then, by pointing from his mouth to his ear,
demands Hamlet's serious attention.
Hamlet touches his own lips, points to Ghost, slaps his heart, and
bows, intimating that the Ghost is to "Speak 1" and he is" bound
to hear."
Ohost explains that he is his father's spirit by stroking Hamlet's
face, and then his own, and then shrinks about the stage to weird
music, descriptive of his prison-house. He concludes by appealing to
Hamlet's love for him by pressing his clasped hands to his own
heart, and then pointing towards the left-hand side of his son.
Hamlet jerks his hands passionately upwards, as if saying, "Oh
Heaven!"
Ohost then asks for revenge by touching his dagger, and pointing
towards the sky. He acts the murder in the garden, showing the
serpent who stung him by gliding about the stage on his chest, like
the boneless man. He shows his murderer to be of hit own blood
by walking up and down as himself, and then in the same way,
but with a slight limp, as if he were his brother.
Hamlet might here exhibit " Zadkiel's Almanack "as" prophetic,"
and slap the sole of his shoe for " soul; " for "my Uncle" it would
be sufficient to produce a pawnbroker's ticket: — Oh my prophetic
soul I Mine Uncle!"
Then the Ohost in great detail acts the murder in the orchard,
imitating the apples and the singing birds, the setting sun, fyc, itc.
He shows the composition of the poison after Us plucking from a
bush, and its arrival in the laboratory. He represents the actual
pouring of the poison in his ear. He hints too (by suggesting the
action of the bell-ringer) that he was never really mourned, and
concludes a most spirited Ballet <PAction by a rapid sketch of the
paling of the ineffectual fires of the glow- worm. As he leaves to the
music of "Then you '11 Remember Me," Hamlet imitates cock-
crow, which brings the entertainment to an appropriate termination.
Surely this would be an improvement upon the conventional read-
ing f In this case where speeoh is silvern, silence would be golden.
Trusting some Manager will take the matter up,
I remain, always yours sincerely, A Dumb Waiter.
OPERATIC NOTES.
Monday.—Faust and Foremost. Miss Eamf.s better even than
she was last week. Ned dk Rbszke not so diabolical a Mephis-
topheles as M. Maurel.
Neddy Reszke
Not so goblineake,
and a stouter sort of demon, but of course a "bon diable."
Wednesday. — Romio et Julietta. Jack and Ned de Resike
Rome a and The Friar. Why the waltz alone, which ought to be
on every organ besides Miss Kames'b, but which, strange to say,

Cards held by Drunolanm Operaticui.
isn't thoroughly popular, should be enough to make an Opera; but it's
like the proportion of one swallow in the composition of a summer,
and, however well sung, it does not do everything. It's a dull
Opera.
Thursday.— Carmen again. House not immense. Persons "of
note " chiefly on the stage. Julia same as before; therefore refer
to previous notice. Cab and carriage service after the theatres
everywhere wants reforming altogether. We may not be worse off
than in any other capital of Europe, but we ought to be far ahead
of them.
Somebody or other complained of my writing " Gluck" instead of
"Gluck." He didn't like the two dots; one too many for the poor
ohap already in his dotage; so to relieve him and soothe him, I '11
write it " Gluck," and then he can go to the proprietor of "David-
son's Libretto Books " and ask him to take the dotlets off the "U"
in Gluck. I wonder if my stronglv-speotacle'd fault-finder writes
the name of Handel correctly f I dare say to oorrect a person never
falls into any sort of error; or if he does, never admits it. I like it
done down to dots, as "Handel," myself; it looks so uncommonly
learned.
Saturday.—Tannhduser. Full and appreciative house to welcome
the rentrie of Madame Alb an i, who was simply perfection and the
perfection of simplicity as the self-sacrificing heroine Elizabeth.
From a certain Wagnerian-moral point of view, no better imper-
sonator,—dramatically at least, if not operatically,—of the sensual
Falstaffian Knight could be found than Signor Pehotti; and, from
every point of view, no finer representation of the Cyprian Venus
than Mile. Sofia Ravooli. M. Maurel was admirable in every
way as the moral Wolframo, and Signor Abrahoff the gravest of
Landgraves. The full title of this Opera should be Tannhduser; or,
The Story of a Bard who sang a questionable kind of Song in the
highest Society, and what came of it.
Fine effect at end of First Aot, when prancing steeds, with second-
hand park-hack saddles, at quite half-a-orown an hour, are brought
in, and, on a striking tableau of bold but impecunious warriors re-
fusing to mount, the Curtain descends.
Then what pleasure to see Albani-Elizabeth receiving the guests
in Aot II., varying the courtesies with an affectionate embrace when-
ever a particular friend among the ladies-of-the -court-chorus oame
in view. My Lord Chamberlain, viewing the soene from his private
box, must have pioked up many a hint for Court etiquette from
studying this remarkable soene. Then how familiar to us all is the
arrangement of the bards all in a row, like our old friends the
Christy Minstrels, Tannhduser being the Tambourine, and Wolfram
the Bones! Charming. Great success. Repeat it by all means.

Yes, grandson mine, the treasure take,
A trinket loved, if little,

In yonder looket brittle;
Small, as my banker's balance, small

[Fragment from a Romance founded upon evidence given be/ore the Select
Committee upon Dram-drinking.)
"I really think the experiment should be made,"'said the
Professor. "Our knowledge on the subject is so imperfect, that
nothing definite can be accurately pronounced."
"True enough," replied one'of his friends; "but although the
end to be attained is excellent, may not the means be termed by the
scrupulous 'questionable P'"
"By the over-scrupulous, perhaps," returned the Professor, with
a smile.
"And the expense," observed a second of his intimates, "will be
no small consideration. If we put the matter to a thorough test,
a large quantity—a very large quantity of the necessary liquid will
have to be purchased and disposed of. Am I not right in hazarding
this supposition P"
"Undoubtedly," responded the Professor, "and the cost will be
enhanced by the fact that the neoessarylliquids will have to be of the
best possible quality. As Dr. Pavey observed before the Committee
'It is not the alcohol in itself that is injurious, but the by-products.'
Oar aim must be to eliminate the by-products."
"I think the idea first-rate," said the third friend; and then he
paused and added, seemingly as an after-thought, " Pass the bottle."
So the Professor and his three companions decided to make the
investigation in the cause of soientifio research. It was resolved
that after a week they should meet again, and that in the meanwhile
they should in their own persons carry on the experiment continuously.
When this had been arranged the friends parted company.
At the appointed time ?the contemplated gathering became a
concrete fact. The Professor's friends were the first to appear at the
rendezvous. They were unsteady as to their gait, their neckties were
in disorder and their hair falling carelessly over their eyes, added a fresh
impediment to an eyesight that seemingly was temporarily defective.
They sank into three chairs regarding one another with a smile that
gradually resolved itself into a frown. Then they filled up the pause
caused by the non-appearance of the Professor by weeping silently.
Their emotion was not of long duration, as the originator of the ex-
periment was soon in their midst. He seemed to be in excellent
health and spirits.
"My dear friend," he said, and it was noticeable that he was prone
to clip his words, and to use the singular, in lieu of the plural, when
the latter would have been more conventional, "My dear friend,
glad see you all. Hope you well."
His comrades received the well-meant greeting with a resentful
frown, which ended in further weeping.
"This very painful," continued the Professor, resting his hand
somewhat heavily on the back of a chair; "very painful indeed!
Fact is. you been taking wrong things 1"
His friends sorrowfully shook their heads negatively.
"Tes you have! Sure of it I You, Sir—imbibed whiskey! No
harm in good whiskey—excellent thing, good whiskey 1 But inju-
riverius—should say, injurious—if has too much flavour of malt!
Your whiskey too much flavour of malt! You took brandy—bad

muoh mo—mo—molasses! Now I took all three—whiskey, brandy,
rum, but pure—no by-products. No, not at all. Result I See!
Sober as judge!"
And, succumbing to" a sudden desire for slumber, the Professor, at
this point of his discourse, joined his friends'under the table!
LEAVES FROM A CANDIDATE'S DIARY.
March 20. "George Hotel" Billshury.—Arrived here yesterday
afternoon. Mother made up her mind to come with me, being very
anxious, she said, to hear one of my splendid speeches. She brought
luggage enough to last for a week, and insisted on taking her poodle
Carlo, who was an awful nuisance, in the train. He growled
horribly at old Tolland and Blissop when they came to see me at
the Hotel before dinner. Very awkward. Tolland wanted to put
before me the state of the case with regard to registration expenses.
The upshot was that the Candidate is expected to subscribe £80 a
year to the Association for this purpose, which I eventually agreed to
do. Found fourteen letters waiting for me. No. 1 was from
Miss Poser, the Secretary of the Billsbury Women's Suffrage
League, asking me to receive a small deputation on the question, and
to lay my views before them. No. 2 from the Anti-Vaccination
League, stating that a deputation had been appointed to meet me, in
order to learn my views, and requesting me to fix a date. No. 3 and
No. -1, from two local lodges of Oddfellows, each declaring it to be of
the highest importance that I should become an Oddfellow and pro-
posing dates for my initiation. Nos. 5, 6 and 7 were from Secretaries
of funds for the restoration or building of Churches and Chapels,
appealing for subscriptions. Nos. 8, 9, and 10, from three more local
Cricket Clubs, who have eleoted me an Honorary Member, and want

subscriptions. No. 11 from a Children's Meat Tea Fund. _ No. 12
asked me to subscribe to a Bazaar, and to attend its opening in June.
No. 13, from the local Fire Brigade, and No. 14 from the Secretary
of the Local Society for improving the Breed of Bullfinches, recom-
mending this "national object" to my favourable notioe. Shall
have to keep a Seoretary, likewise a book of accounts. Where is it
all going to end P
The Mass Meeting went off well enough. The Assembly Booms
were crammed. (The Meteor says, with its usual accuracy and good
taste, "The attendance was small, the proceedings were dull.
A wonderful amount of stale Jingoism was afterwards swept up
by the caretakers from the floor. Our Conservative friends are so
wasteful.") I was adopted as Candidate almost unanimously, only
ten hands being held up against me. One or two questions were
asked—one about local option, which rather stumped me—but I
managed to express great sympathy with the Temperanoe party
without, I hope, offending publicans.
Carlo somehow or other'got out of the hotel and followed us to the
meeting without being noticed. Poodles are all as cunning as Old
Nick. He lay quite low in some corner or other, until Colonel
Chobkle was in the middle of a tremendous appeal to "the stain-
less banner whioh 'as so often been borne to triumph by Billsbury's
embattled chivalry." The Colonel thumped on the table very hard,
and Carlo, I suppose, had his eye on him and thought he was going
to thump me. At any rate he sprang out and dashed at the Colonel,
barking furiously. I had to seize him and take him outside. The
Colonel turned quite pale. The Meteor says: "The war-like ardour
whioh burns in the breast of Colonel Chobkle was well-nigh ex-
tinguished by an intelligent dog, whose interruptions provoked
immense applause." I had to apologise profusely to the Colonel
afterwards. Mrs. Chobkle looked daggers at me. Mother was
delighted with the meeting. She has written about it to Aunt
AlTHT.TA.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FBOM THE DUET OP TOBT, M.P.
House of Comment, Monday Night, April 13.—So long since Lord
Stalbridge parted company from Richard Gbosvenob that he
forgets manners and customs of House of Commons. Not being
satisfied with choice made by Committee of Selection of certain
Members on Committee dealing with Railway Rates and Charges,
Stalbriese writes peremptory letter _ to Chairman, giving him
severe wigging; correspondence gets into newspapers; House of
Commons, naturally enough, very angry. Not going to stand
this sort of thing from a mere Peer, even though he be Chair-
man of North-Western Railway. Talk of making it case of privi-
lege. Sort of thing expected to be taken up from Front Bench,
or by WnrrnRFAD, or some other Member of standing. Some-
how, whilst thing being thought over and talked about, Sixton
undertakes to see it through. As soon as questions over to-
night, rises from below Gangway, and in his comically impressive
manner, announces intention of putting certain questions to John
Mowbbat, Chairman of Committee of Selection. Ordinary man
would have put his questions and sat down. But this a great
occasion for Sexton. Domestic difficulties in Irish Party kept him
away from Westminster for many weeks. No opportunity for
Windbag to come into action; now is the time, as champion of
privileges of House of Commons. Position one of some difficulty.
Not intending to conolude with a Motion, he would be out of order in
making a speech. Could only ask question. Question couldn't possibly
extend over two minutes; two minutes, nothing with the Windbag
full, bursting after compulsory quiescence since Parliament opened.
Sexton managed admirably; kept one eye on Speaker, who
from time to time moved uneasily in chair. Whenever he looked
like going to interrupt, Sexton lapsed into interrogatory, which put
him in order; then went on again, patronising John Mowbbat,
posing as champion of privileges of House, and so thoroughly enjoying
himself, that only a particularly cantankerous person could have
complained. Still, it was a little long. "This isn't Sexton's
funeral, is it P" Habcot/bt asked, in loucTwhisper.
"No," said Campbell-Bannekman; "it was
Stalbridge's;
meant to be
but I fancy
Sexton will save him from
full inconvenience of the cere-
mony."
So it turned out; House
tired of business long before
Windbag Sexton had blown
himself out. Poor John Mow-
bbat admittedly flabber-
ghasted by the interminable
string of questions under
which Sexton had tried to
disguise his speeeh. Stal-
bridge got off without direct
censure, and Donald Cam-
ebon abruptly turned the con-
versation in the direction of

in the Lords, of course; listened to with respect, much as Ha [.lam's

readjustment of circumstance, Granville himself would have made,
an assembly not emotional feels with keen pang how mnoh it has lost

Granville; at the other, the dapper figure, with its indescribable
air of old-fashioned gentlemanhood, the light of his smile shed
impartially on the benches opposite, but his slight bow reserved for
the Mabkiss, as, leaning across the table, he pinked him under the
fifth rib with glittering rapier—this is a sight that will never more
gladden the eye in the House of Lords. Granville was the comple-
ment of the Mabkiss; the Mark iss was to Gran ville an incentive
to his bitter-sweetness. Never again will they meet to touch shield
with lance across the table in the Lords. Licn>AS is dead, not ere
his prime, it is true;
"Bat, 0 the heavy change, now thou art gone,
Now thou art gone, and never must return!"
It seemed in stumbling inadequate phrase that Cbanbbook,
Eimbeblet, Derby, and Skiborne strummed their lament. But,
speaking from different points of view, without pre-concert, they
struck the same chord in recognising the ever unruffled gentleness of
the nature of Ltcidas—a gentleness not born of weakness, a sweet-
ness of disposition that did not unwholesomely oloy. Only Mr. G.

his beard, to the.manifest chagrin of his jilted
moustache.

A Dustman's Silent Tear.
I know not how that Dustman stirred my ire:
He may have failed to c all when due: but he—
My breast being charged with economic fire,—
Was mulcted of his customary fee.
I was informed, at first he did not seem
To grasp the cruel sense of what he heard,
Bnt asked, "Wot's this 'ere game P" as if some dream
Of evil portents all his pulses stirred;
Then, muttering, he turned, and went his way
Dejected, broken! I had stopped his beer 1
Ah 1 from that Dustman who, alas! can say
I did not wring a sad and silent tear 1
I thought the matter o'er. I vowed no more,
That I with grief would moisten any eye;
Henceforth, whene'er that Dustman passed my door,
Upon his beer he knew he could rely I
Nay more! For never heeding if my bin
Were full or empty, I that Dustman hailed;
His grateful smile my one desire to win;]
I felt I could not help it if I failed.
Twice every week he oame,—his twopenoe drew:
That Dustman seemed to brighten with his beer.
And. if he wept, thank Heaven, at least I knew
With joy, not grief, he shed hit silent tear!

LEAVES FROM A CANDIDATE'S DIARY.
[CONTINUBD.]
Thursday, April 16.—On looking through my book I find that I
am now a member of ten Billsbury Cricket Clubs, to most of which
I am a Vice-President. Not bad, considering that my average in my
last year at school was four, and that I
didn't play more than half-a-dozen times
at Oxford. Tolland says there are many
more Foot-ball Clubs than Cricket Clubs
| —a pleasant prospect for me in the
Autumn. Have also had to subscribe
to six Missions of various kinds, four
Easter Monday Fetes, six Friendly
Societies, three Literary and Scientific
Institutes, five Temperance Associations,
four Quoit Clubs, two Swimming Clubs,
seven Sunday Schools, five Church or
Chapel Building Funds, three Ornithological Societies, two Christian
Young Men's Associations, three Children's Free Dinner Funds, one
Angling Association, not to speak of Fire Brigade, Dispensaries, and
Brass Bands. Have also given a Prize to be shot for by Volunteers,
as Chubson gives one every year. What with £80 subscription to
the Registration Fund, things are beginning to mount up pretty
considerably.
Have spoken at three meetings since the Mass Meeting. Tolland
said, "You needn't refer to Sir Thomas Chubson yourself. Leave
our people to do that. They enjoy that kind of thing, and know
how to do it." They do, indeed. At our last meeting, Hollf.kone,
the Secretary of the Junior Conservative Club, went on at him for
twenty minutes in proposing resolution of confidence in me. "Sir
Thomas," he said, talks of his pledges. The less Sir Thomas says
about them the better. I oan't walk out anywhere in Billsbury for
two minutes without tripping over the broken fragments of some of
Sir Thomas's pledges. It's getting quite dangerous. Sir Thomas,
they say, made himself. It's a pity he couldn't put in a little con-
sistency when he was engaged on the job. We don't want any
purse-proud Radical knights to represent us. We want a straight-
forward man, who says what he means; and you '11 agree with me,
fellow-townsmen, that we've got one in our eloquent and popular
young Candidate."
This went down very well. Next day, however, the Meteor
"parallel-columned" Sir Thomas Ckubson's career and mine.
Mine occupied six lines; Sir Thomas's "Life of honourable and self-
sacrificing industry" ran to nearly a column. "It will be observed,"
said the Meteor, "that there is a good deal of blank space in
Mr. Pattle's comparative career; but this no doubt recommends
him to his Conservative friends, who are quite equal to filling it
brilliantly with their imaginative rhetoric about his chances of
success."
Primrose Day, the day after to-morrow. We 're going to have a
great demonstration at Billsbury. Mother is going down with me
to-morrow.
April20th, "GeorgeHotel," Billsbury.—The Demonstration yester-
day was a splendid success. At ten o'clock in the morning the Conserva-
tive BandZmarohed up to the Hotelfand played patriotio airs under
the window. Mother and I drove to the Beaoonsfield Club in an open
carriage and pair, escorted by the band. Mother's bonnet was all
primroses, and she carried an immense bouquet of them. Carlo
oame with us and sat on the back-seat. His collar was stuck full
of primroses, and small bunches were tied on to the tufts on his back
and at the end of his tail. I wore a buttonhole of primroses, and
oarried a huge primrose wreath to be placed round the bust of Lord
Beaconsfikld, which stands in the hall of the Club. The coachman
and horses too were all tricked out with bunches. Tolland and
Chorkle, and all the leaders of the Party, met us at the entrance of
the Club, and the ceremony of depositing the flowers all round the
bust began. Chorkle, who once shook hands with Dizzy in the
lobby of the House, made a great speech, mostly composed of personal
reminiscences of our great departed leader. (By the way Chorkle
has six children, five of them being sons, whose names are Ben-
jamin Disraeli Chorkle, Cecil Salisbury Chorkle, Strafford
Thorough Chorkle, Hobbes Leviathan Chorxxe, and Ran-
dolph Churchill Chorkle.) The sixth, eighteen months
old, is a girl. Her name is Williamlna Henrietta Smith
Chorkle. They were all present, covered with primroses. _ I
added a few words about the inspiring effect that the contemplation
of Lord Beaconskield's career must have upon the youth of the
country. Mother's bouquet kept falling off the place she had put it
on, and two or three enthusiasts always dashed forward to piok it up,
causing a good many collisions. In the middle of my speech, Carlo
walked into the centre of the hall, sat down and proceeded to gnaw
off the primroses which had been tied to his tail. He then ate them
all solemnly, and after that rolled over on his back with his paws
stuok straight out, pretending he was dead. I must tell Mother not
to bring that dog again. There was a great banquet in the evening.
Yuxliamy oame down for it and spoke very kindly about me in his
speech. Said he had followed my career with profound interest and
pleasure from my earliest years. I've only known him a year.

NOTHING LIKE DISCIPLINE!
(Extract from the Diary of Private Atkins, Prince's Company, ilh
Battalion, H.M.'s OuzzUbeer Guards.)
Monday,—Joined the Regiment. Appeared on Parade, and was
requested to oome to " attention," although the Sergeant must have
seen that I was "standing at ease." Expressed
a desire that the Commanding-officer should
rectify the mistake, when all ended amicably.
Sergeant apologised, and promised that it should
not occur again. Satisfied. Both Sergeant and
Commanding-officer well up in their duties!
Tuesday.—Bugle sounded too early for Assem-
bly. Sent a message to the Adjutant by his
orderly (with my compliments) saying that I would
feel much obliged if the Parade were postponed
an hour. Adjutant returned his compliments,
with a request that I would give in writing my
reason for desiring a delay. Explained (by word
of mouth) that I wanted to read the newspaperr.
Parade consequently postponed] as .requested. Obliging chap the
Adjutant!
Wednesday.—Warned for Guard. Sent for the Major of my half-
battalion (don't like bothering the Commanding-officer about every
trifie), and explained that, although the Surgeon had seen me, and
reported me fit, I had a presentiment that the easterly winds would
play the very mischief with me if I went "Sentry Go." Major
thought, perhaps it would be better if I were struck off duty.
Excused Guard in consequence. Good sort Major of my half-
battalion!
Thursday.—Sorry to find rations very unsatisfactory. Complained
to the Officer of the day, who reported the matter to the Captain.
Captain said he would nave asked the entire company to dine with
him at his Club had he not been engaged. He then passed us on to
his Subs. The latter most obligingly gave us some food at a
Restaurant. Chateaubriand excellent, Sole d la Normande decent,
but Potage d la bisque too rich. Mistake to order the latter,
as one can never get it really good, except on the Continent. Wine
tol-lol. Pol Royer of '84. However, spent a very pleasant evening.
Both Subs, when you know them, not half bad fellows I
Friday.—Rather a head, and felt generally out of sorts. Warned
for Kit-inspection. Couldn't stand this, so oalled upon General Com-
manding District. Not at home, but was asked would I see his
locum tenens t Replied in the negative, as I don't believe in go-
betweens. Didn't return to barracks, as I thought I might get a
breath of sea-air at Southend.
Suturday.—Arrested and conveyed to the Guard-room. Suppose I
shall be released with a caution. At any rate, for the present, diary
confiscated. I1

WANTED A LOCAL HABITATION.
[Commended by Mr. Punch to the Patrons oj British Art.)

House,—it oslv remains fob tow to build it."

be unwise to risk the failure of the gift of £80,000 which had been offered to erect a building.]
SOMEBODY'S LUGGAGE.
In view of the intense pnblio excitement aroused by the statement
that Lord Randolph Chtjbchill, in his expedition to Mashonaland,
is only going to take two books with him—Shaxspeare and Moliebe
—an Inquiring Correspondent has recently written to several
eminent persons on this subject, and has received—so he says—the
following replies:—
Bra,—Tou ask me what books I should take'if 1 were contemplat-
ing a visit to the Dark Continent, like Lord Randolph Cuckchill.
The question, in the abstract, and without reference to my own per-
sonality, is an interesting one, and no doubt human fallibility would,
in the case you suppose, induce me to take several volumes of my
own Gleanings with me,—not so much for their intrinsic merits, as
because perhaps they might form a new kind of literature for native
African potentates. Homer, too, of course. At my time of life,
however, I must be excused from grappling with any new Conti-
nents, dark or otherwise. I find that Ireland is quite dark enough
for me just now. Excuse a card. Yours, W. £. Gl- dst-ne.
Bis,—As I am not "contemplating an expedition to the Dark
Continent," and have no sympathy with Hottentots, there seems to
be no sufficient reason for my answering your questions, or for your
asking them. S-l-sb-bt.
Sir,—Your question is ridiculous. The only books worth taking
to Africa, or anywhere else, would be a bound copy of last year's
Review of Reviews, General Booth's epoch-making volume, and—
this is indispensable-Sin C. D-lke'b invaluable Problem* of Greater
Britain. When I went to Rome, I naturally took with me the " hun-
dred best books in the world." They were a little heavy, but I thought
the Pops would like to see them. However, circumstances prevented
to His Holiness. Yours, W. T. 8t-d.
Sib,—I don't know muoh about books. I've just written rather a
good one on Cricket, and I think if I were going to Africa I should
take a supply. From all I've heard of Tippoo Tib, I should think he
would enjoy the game; at any rate Tippoo ought to be able to master
tip and run without much difficulty. W. G. Gb-ck.
Sib,—Having consulted my relatives—also Captain M-l-sw-bth
—as to whether there would be any impropriety in giving a reply to
your questions, I am happy to say that they seem to think there
would be none, but that on the contrary it might even assist the
takings at the Aquarium. I may therefore mention that if I were
proceeding to Central Africa there is only on* book I should dream of
taking with me. That would be a copy of the Proceedings of the
London County Council, since the joyful date of its advent on this
planet. Yours obediently, Z - o.
Sir,—The one book I should take with me to Africa would be Dr.
Peters' recent valuable work—More Light on Dark Africa. I
should give it to the Dwarfs. It would make capital poisoned
arrows. H. M. Si-itl-t.
Sib,—The only book worth thinking about for such an expedition
as you mention would be Stanley's In Darkest Africa. Its Haps
would be invaluable,—as presents for a rival explorer, whom one
might desire to mislead as to his route. Carl P-t-bs.
Mr. Herkomer and Mr. Pennell.
Professor Herkomer defends the use of Photography for the en-
Eaver's purposes, and dearly thinks that what Tennyson ought to
ve written, in Locksley Hall, was—
"And the thoughts of men are widened by a Process of the Sun's."
He also comforts himself with the reflection that being called over the
coals in the National Observer, is one of the PnnrxL-ties of success.

(Condensed and Rented Version by Mr. P.'s Own Harmless Ibsenite.)
No. III.—HEDDA GABLER.
Act n.
Scent.—The cheerful dark Drawing-room. It is afternoon. Hedda
stands loading a revolver in the back Drawing-room.
Hedda {looking out, and shouting). How do you do, Judge?
(Aims at him.) Mind yourself! [She fires.
Brack (entering). What the devil! Do you usually take pot-shots
at casual visitors? [Annoyed.
Hedda. Invariably, when they come by the back-garden. It is
my unconventional way of intimating that I am at home. One does
do these things in realistic dramas, you know. And I was only
aiming at the blue sky.
Brack. Which accounts for the condition of my hat. (Exhibiting
it.) Look here—riddled!
Hedda, Couldn't help myself. I am so horribly bored with Tes-
XAir. Everlastingly to be with a professional person'
Brack (sympathetically). Our excellent Tesmak is certainly a bit
of a bore. (Looks searchingly at her.) What on earth made yon
marry him?
Hedda. Tired of dancing, my dear, that's all. And then I used
Tesm an to take me home from parties; and we saw this
villa ; and I said I liked it, and so did he: and so we found
some common ground, and here we are, do you see I And
I loathe Tkbuas, and I don't even like the villa now;
and I do feel the want of an entertaining companion so 1
Brack. Try me. Just the kind of three-cornered
arrangement that I like. Let me be the third person in
the compartment—(confidentially)—the tried friend, and,
generally speaking, cook of the walk 1
Hedda (audibly drawing in her breath). I cannot
resist your polished way of putting things. We will con-
clude a triple alliance. But hush!—here comes Tesm an.
[Enter George, with a number of books under his arm.
George. Puff! I am hot, Hkdda. I've been looking
into Lovbobg's new book. Wonderfully thoughtful—
confound him 1 But I must go and dress tor your party,
Judge. [He goes out.
Hedda. I wish I could get Tesman to take to politics,
Judge. Couldn't he be a Cabinet Minister, or something?
Brack. H'm!

speaking. Enter Geobqe, in evening dress, with
gloves.

seven—but I like to dress early. Fancy that I And I am
expecting Lovborg.

and pale, with red patches on his cheek-bones, and
wears an elegant perfectly new visi'.ing-tuit, and
black gloves.
Qeorge. Welcome I (Introduces him to Brack.) Listen
I have got your new book, but I haven't read it through

but it 'a over now. See, we spent a night in that little mountain
village, Tesm aw and I!
Lovborg. Did you, indeed? Do yon remember that delicious
moment when you threatened to shoot me down—(tenderly)—I do!
Hedda (carelessly). Did IP I have done that to so many people.
But now all that is past, and you have found the loveliest consola-
tion in dear, good, little Mrs. Elvsted—ah, here she is! (Enter
Mrs. Elvsted.) Now, Thea, sit down and drink up a good glass
of oold punch. Mr. Lovbobo is going to have some. If you don't,
Mr. Lovhobg, Geobge and the Judge will think you are afraid of
taking too much if you < nee begin.
Mrs. E. Oh, please, Hedda 1 When I've inspired Mr. Lovborg
so—good gracious I don't make him drink cold punch!
Hedda. You see, Mr. Lovbobo, our dear little friend can't trust you I
Lovborg. So that is my comrade's faith in me! (Gloomily.) I '11
show her if I am to be trusted or not. (He drinks a glass of punch.)

Hedda (stopping him). No more now. You are going to a party,
remember. [Geobge and Tesman come in from back-room.
Lovborg. Don't be angry, Thea. I was fallen for a moment.
Now I'm up again! (Mrs. E. beams with delight). Judge, I'll
come to your party, as you are so pressing, and I 'U read Geobge my
manuscript all the evening. I '11 do all in my power to
make that party go I

Hedda. There, go away, you wild rollicking creatures!

home 1
Mrs. E. Oh, goodness, yes! (In concealed agony.) Mr.
Lovbobo, I shan't go away till you do 1

is lowered for a minute; when it is raised, it u
7 a.m., and Mrs. Elvsted and Hedda are dis-
covered sitting up, with rugs around them.
Mrs. E. (wearily). Seven in the morning, and Mr.
Lovbobo not here to take me home yet! what can he be
doing?
Hedda (yawning). Reading to Tesman, with vine-leaves
in his hair, I suppose. Perhaps he has got to the third part.
Mrs. E. Oh, do you really think so, Hedda P Oh, if I
could but hope he was doing that!
Hedda. You silly little ninny! I should like to scorch
your hair off. Go to bed! [Mrs. E.goes. Enter George.

CAN A MAN IMPEISON HIS WIFE?
(An Autobiographical Consideration of the Question, by an Eminent
Legal Authority.)
Ii may be remembered that (I trust) in deserved acknowledg-
ment of my professional pre-eminence, I received, some little while
ago, the appointment of a Deputy-Assistant-Revising-Barrister-
sfiip. In performing the duties of this important office, I sometimes
have to incur bodily risk—the more es-
pecially when I have to distinguish between
the rival claims of the political parties
that I am sorry to say have made Lamb-
ville-oum-Minton the antithesis of heaven
upon earth. On the oooasion to which I
particularly wish to refer, I was ac-
companied by my Wife, to my seoret annoy-
ance, as I am afraid the Lady who does me
the honour to share my name is unduly
apprehensive of my safety, and, besides
this general plea, I had yet another special
reason for desiring her absence. To tell
the truth, I had been greatly moved by a
Summing Up. decision given in the Court of Appeal,
whereby it seemed to me (and no doubt to many of my learned
friends) the custody of a wife by her husband had become an
empty phrase, signifying nothing. I felt that if, by any means, I
could get this judgment set aside, I would not only confer upon
myself, as a married man, a signal benefit, but, moreover, as a
Counsel, obtain increased professional distinction. However, I
was embarrassed by the presence of my Wife, when I came to con-
sider the best mode in which marital authority might be assumed
to raise the question of the right of habeas corpus. I had returned
to my room before the opening of the Registration Court at Lamb-
ville-cum-Minton, in rather a disturbed frame of mind. Truth to
tell, my Wife, having learned that political feeling was rising so high
in the town that it was possible that the Deputy -Assistant-
Revising-Barrister might be assaulted by either or both of the rival
factions, had done her best to dissuade me from taking my customary
seat.
"What shall I do, to say nothing of the darling children, if you
are brought home on a hurdle P" she sobbed out.
I assured her that there was a very remote risk of my succumbing
to suoh a fate, as the conveyance home on a hurdle raised the pre-
sumption that the victim had been hunting, a sport in which I
seldom, I may say, never indulged. But this explanation did not
reassure her, and she left me in tears. Her emotion caused me much
pain, the more especially as my proposed task seemed to me, under
the circumstances, a species of domestic treason. However, I
hardened my heart, and sat down to consider the facts of the case.
To allow the right of seizure to be argued, it would be necessary to
take my Wife out of the custody of someone other than myself. Her
mother, a most estimable old lady, with whom I have had many a
pleasant and exciting game of backgammon, seemed a right and
proper person to assist me in carrying out my project. But the
objection immediately occurred to me that it would be an exceedingly
difficult matter to induce her to hold my Wife from me unless I
desired her to take suoh a course. But if I made this request, would
not the proceeding savour of collusion? To meet this obstacle I
came to tile conclusion that I might get my Wife to pay a visit to her
mother, and then, appropriately disguised, seize and carry her off. By
locking her in the conveyance and riding on the box, I could preserve
my incognito until reaching home, and then I might confine her in
her own room with assumed harshness, and possibly (of this I had
some doubt) get her to complain of her imprisonment. By keeping
my Wife's domicile a close secret, her mother would be induced to
visit me to ask my professional assistance in recovering her daughter.
Thus approached it would be possible to so advise the old lady that
in the result she would demand my Wife's presence in Court under
a writ of habeas corpus. Then would come my opportunity. Of
course I would produce my Wife, and having carefully prepared my
arguments, would deliver an oration that would fill columns of the
newspapers, and hand down my name to generations to come as the
authority on marital rights. I saw in the near future wealth and
restored domestic happiness. But the first thing to do was to look up
my Wife. And at this point it occurred to me that it was time for
me to walk over to the Revision Court. I hastily gathered certain
necessary articles into my brief-bag, and putting on my hat, grasped
the handle of the door. To my surprise I found that I could obtain
no egress. I rang the bell—and instead of a servant my Wife
answered the summons. "The door is looked, dear," I observed,
"and as the key seems to be on the other side, will you kindly open
it, as I am in a hurry to be off."
"You will stay where you are," was the reply. "You'are not
going to get killed by attending a nonsensical Revision Court."
"But I must go," I explained; and then assuming a tone of
authority I rarely adopt, I added, "and yon will be good enough to
open the door at once."
"I shall do nothing of the sort," replied my Wife, calmly. "I
locked you in, and I shan't let you out."
"What, Madam," I exclaimed; "do you defy myauthority f"
"CertainlyI" was the immediate response. "You may say or
think what you like, but you don't leave this house to-day as sure as
I am your lawfully wedded Wife."
And as a matter of fact I didn't I

OPERATIC NOTES.

Monday.—-To see Madame Alb ah i as Violetta the consumptive
herione of " La Traviata." Charmingly sung and admirably, nay.
most touohingly, acted. Maukel excellent as Oermont Senior, and
Montariol quite the weak-minded masher Alfredo. What a
different turn the story might have taken had it occurred to Violetta
to have a flirtation with the handsome middle-aged pere noble! At
one time it almost seemed as if there had been some change in
motive of the Opera since I last saw it, and that the above original
idea was about to be carried out. But no; in another seoond Oermont-
Maurel as " Old Maurelity" (by kind permission of Toby, M.P.) had
pulled himself together, and Albani- Violetta was in the depths of
remorseful sorrow. In that gay and festive supper scene, where a
physician, unostentatiously styled 11 Dottore (he would probably be
III Dottore the morning alter) is present to look after the health of
the guests, and perhaps to "propose" it, I noticed with pleasure
that, on the tables, Drubiolanus
Aldermaniccs, mindful of oivio
feasts, had piaoed bottles of real
champagne, or at least real cham-
pagne-bottles. This interested the
audience muohly, and numerous were
the glasses turned in the direction of
the bottles—of course 'tis opera-
glasses I mean, yer honour,—in order
to ascertain what particular wanity
was La Traviata's favourite; but
the bottles were so placed that only
one unimportant word on the label was visible. Was it Fommery '80
tris sec T—Or what was it? Impossible to see: it was not men-
tioned in the dialogue, so " Mumm " might have been the word.
But at all events, if the wine is one whioh requires advertisement, the
guests should be told to be very careful to leave_ the bottles in the
same position as in the old prefatial stage-directions "the reader of
the play" is supposed to be; >.«., "on the stage, facing the audience."
Wednesday.—Rigoletto, M. Macrel as the Jester; acting good,
voice too loud. Albani, as Oilda, overwhelmed with encores.
M. Montabiol's II Duca is Alfredo over again, only oonfirmed in a
vioious career. To obtain an encore for the great but now hackneyed
song, "La Donna e mobile," a wonderful rendering is absolutely
essential, and somehow something seems wanting to the success of
Rigoletto when this song goes for nothing and is passed without a
rapturous "bis, bis!" which makes a Manager rub his hands and
smilingly say to himself, "Good bis-ness.
Thursday.—Lohengrin I believe, but wasn't there. Hope the
Opera went all right without me. Can't be in more places than one
at the same moment. Same remarks apply to Friday and Saturday.
TO HISS ALTCE ATHKBTOH AT THE STRAND THEATRE.

Those fool-knots of Hymen's tying;
Dames, who once with him had sided,
Openly his wares derided.
"Who'll buy my love-knots?
Who '11 buy my love-knots P"
All at that old cry came flocking,
Mocking in a style quite shocking.
"Here are knots," said Hymen, taking
Some loose nooses of Law's making.
"Pooh!" the nymphs cried. "Who can
trust 'em P
We have changed your queer old custom.
Who '11 buy your love-knots P
Who '11 buy your love-knots?
Women they bind not. nor tie men.
You 're a helpless gaoler, Hymen I
"When the bargain is completed,
We have bnt to cry, 1 We 're cheated!'
And you '11 find you 're sold most sadly.
Love-knots? Fools'-knots! They tie badly.
Who'll buy your love-knots P
Who '11 buy your love-knots P
Burdens you would lay our backs on—
Our reply is—Tolstoi I Jackson 1"
Hymen dropped his torch; its splutter
Was extinguished in the gutter.
"At my torch and orown of roses
These young minxes cock their noses.
Who^U buy my love-knots P
Who '11 buy my love-knots P
What's the use P Twixt Law and Passion,
Hymen.'8 plainly out of fashion 1
Love, who saw the whole proceeding,
Would have laughed but for good breeding.
"Best join me," he cried. "Old Chappie 1
Ibsen read, be free, and happy!
Who '11 buy your love-knots?
Who'll buy your love-knots?
Have a spree—all shackles scorning,
Come 1 'We won't go home till morning!'"
A BACONIAN THEORY;
Or, Trying it On.
Solomon isn't in it with Judge Bacon.
The point was whether Mrs. Manley had made
Miss Dorothy Dene's dresses to fit or not.
"To fit or not to fit, that was the question."
The Judge gave his decision after a fair trial
of the two costumes—this might be remem-
bered on both sides as "the trying-on case,"—
that, according to the evidence of unimpeach-
able witnesses represented by the Judge's own
common-sense and artistic eye for effect, two of
the dresses and a cloak didn't lit, and that so far,
the Defendant, Miss Dorothy, must consider
herself, in a dress- making sense,"non-suited."
Mrs. Manley had, of course, undertaken to
provide fits for her customers, and for having
partially failed, her customers determined to
return the compliment, by'' giving her tits " if
possible. So the parties came before Judge
Bacon, and appealed to His Honour. And the
learned Judge mindful of ancestral Baconian
wisdom, " Cast a severe eye upon the ex-
ample,—that is, he examined the dresses most
critioally,—" but a merciful eye upon the per-
ton," —for the fair Plaintiff and fair Defen-
dant His Honour showed himmlf a most fair
Judge, unwilling, as Bacon, "to give beans"
to either party, and so dismissing them with
his beany-diction. But, pauca verba,—and
may we always have nothing but praise to
bestow on Bacon't Eteaye.

Hklmttth Karl Bernhabd ton Moltkb.
Born, October 26th, 1803. Died, April 2ith, 1891.
Strong, silent Soldier, whom the unmarked years
Shaped to such service of the Fatherland
As seldom to one firm, unfailing hand,
A State hath owed; to-day a People's tears
Bedew the most illustrious of biers!
The waning century hastening to its close
Hath scarce a greater on its glory-roll,
Hope of thy land, and terror of its foes;
Of foresight keen, and long-enduring soul 1
War's greatness is not greatest; there are heights
Of splendour pure mere warriors scarce may scale.
But thou wert more than battle's scourge and nail,
Calm-souled controller of such Titan fights
As mould man's after-history. When thy star
Shone clear at Koniggratz, men gazed and knew
The light that heralds the great Lords of War;
And when o'er Sedan thy black Eagles flew
And the bold Frank, betrayed and broken, drew
One shuddering gasp of agony and sank,
When thy long-mustered legions rank on rank
Hemmed the fair, fated City of men's love,
Then thy star culminated, shone above
All but the few fixed beacon-lights, which owned
A new compeer. Long steadfastly enthroned
In German hearts, and all men's reverence,
Suddenly, softly thou art summoned hence,
To the great muster, full of years and fame!
How thinks he, lord of a co-equal name,
Thine ancient comrade in war's iron lists,
Just left, and lone, of the Titanic Three
Who led the Eagles on to victory?
Calmest of Captains, first of Strategists.
Bismakck must bend o'er thy belaurelled bier
With more than common grief in the unbidden tear!

ROBERT AT THE CHILDREN'S FANCY BALL.
Well, I've said it afore, and now I says it agane, as I don't
bleeve as sich another both bewtifool and elhgant site is to be seen in
all the world, as is to be seen at these anniwersary yearly festivals
in our nobel Egipshun All at the honoured Manshun|House.
Of course I don't no what sort of intertainement
was held there when the ainoient Egipshnns had it,
or. weather they ewer was there at all—for I ain't
much of a hantiquery; but, from what I've seen of
some on 'em at the British Mewseum, I should think
as there werry peoulyar style of dress was not muoh
■ \!?S"_ sooted to such occashuns.
'ft-RUsk _, I thinks, upon the hole, as the children's dresses
on this speshal ocashun beat the record," as the
runners and jumpers says, both for illigance and
wariety, and, shoud I atemt to describe 'em, where
on airth shoud I begin 1 But, as I must begin
sum where?, I hopes as I shan't awake the bihng
jealousy of all the other mothers present when
I says as I gives the Parm Tree to the two rayther
youthfool Beef Eaters. As for the number of Angels and Fairys,
with most lovly wings, they was so numerus, and so bewtifool, that
ewen I, a pore I ted Waiter, coudn't help the thort, that they was a
giving me my first glimpse of Pairodioe. Then again "I noticed as
the grashus and hansum Lady Marbss—who I should ha liked to
ha seen putting herself at the hed of them all, and leading em all
round the bewtifool All—had most kindly inwited a few poor ereetures,
such as nusses, and charity Gals, and plow boys, and setterer, just
to let 'em see what they may sum day cum to be, if so be as they is
all good.
There was a lot of Hartists a going about makin skitches of the
werry prettiest dresses insted of the werry prettiest faces, as I shood
most suttenly have done. One of 'em wanted for to take my pioter,
but as I coudn't bleeve it was for my bewty, and was quite sure it
wasn't for mv full heavening dress, and ooud therefore ony be for
fun, 1 respekfully declined.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
"Oh Willow! Willow!" Mr. Grace's memories of Forty years
of Cricket are full of interest, of enthusiasm, and of good stories.
"My Early Cricket Days" will hugely interest young would-be
Willow-wielders. "Cricketers I have Met" is excellent reading, the
Champion being as generous in appreciation as keen in judgment. On
the science of the game he, of course, speaks as one having authority.
Thackeray said he never saw a boy without wishing to give him a
sovereign. The "Co." for some time to come will not look on an
athletic lad without longing to give him a copy of "Cricket; by
W. G. Grace." He hopes that lots of other " dasters" will feel the
same yearning, and act upon it.
One of the "Co." reports that he has been reading a work on
Decorative Electricity, by Mrs. J. S. H. Gobdon, and a very pretty
and original little book he found it, full of suggestions, ingenious,
fanciful, and practical, all at once—a rare combination. "Those
about to" instal—and most of us will find ourselves in that position,
sooner or later—will gain some invaluable hints and ideas from this
volume, which, in addition to its other merits, is charmingly illus-
trated. Before very long we shall all be modern Aladdins, and
summon our Slave of the Lamp as a matter of course. But there is
plenty of scope for imagination in devising the form of his appear-
ance, notwithstanding, and Mrs. Gordon's book shows us how the
Genius may be compelled to present himself in a variety of pleasing
and fantastic shapes.
The Baron is of opinion that The Seal of Fate, by Lady Pollock
and W. H. Pollock, is an interesting but somewhat discursive novel.
Will it be followed by The Fate of the Seal,* tale of the Fishery

UPON AFfilC'S SHORE;
Ob, The Battlb or the Heroes.
UTot by the Author of "The Battle of Limerick.
Ye lovers of the nation,
Who burn with indignation,
And England's obfuscation perpetually de-
plore;
Ye floaters of our factions,
And partisan distractions,
How like ye the transactions upon Afrio's
shore?
Ye've all heard of the Lion
Who a rival cast his eye on,
(Yon '11 find him in Bombattei) and thought the
brute a bore.
Such rival Leos flourish,
And mutual hatred nourish,
With a snapping almost onrrish, upon Afric's
shore.
Faith their manes are always waving,
And their claws for contest craving,
And their forms are always rampant, and
they 're ever at full roar,
And in book and morning paper,
They still clapperclaw and oaper,
And they worry, snarl and vapour about
Afrio's shore.
There was Emin, sage paoifio,
The serene and soientino,
Who a wondrous reputation in a hero-
patriot bore,
Until " rescued" by brave Stanley,
Who declared him weak, unmanly
Oh! 'tis strange how heroes can lie about
Afrio's snore.
Then Barttelot and Tboup,
Jephson, Jamison— a group
Who each of eaoh "made soup"—off eaoh
other tried to score;
And in many a verjuiced " vollum"
Stanley's jovial " Rear Column"
Was discussed in manner solemn, anent
Afrio's shore.
Then the " foreign element"
To it tooth and nail they went,
And the Battle of the Heroes it grew livelier
than before.
Now that man, and now this man,
Now Be Brazza and now Wissmanw,
Made it hot for poor Old England upon
Afric's shore.
Now comes Peters 1 He has slanged
Starlet awfully, and banged
The "Rescue" party badly. It is getting a
big bore,
When, with tempers hot as Indies,
Heroes smash each other's windies,
Pursuing of their shindies about Afrio's
shore.
It is doubtless " moighty fine,"
Being what Titmarsh called "a line,"
And it does Society's " sowl" good (no doubt)
to hear him roar;
But 'tis folly to suppose
He must rush upon his foes,
And hit them on the nose, upon Afrio's shore.
Early Closing Movement.—When Mr.
Smith proposed shutting up shop early on
Tuesdays and Fridays, Sir Robert Fowler
was all for singing, " We won't go home till

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED. FROM THE DIABY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, April 20.—The other week T. C.
Baking was sitting among us, one of the Members for the City of
London. Now Baking is no more, ana to-
night Hucks Gibbs oomes in to take his
place. Vicary G. brought his father
down; watched him take oath and has
undertaken generally to see him through.
In fact, when Gibbs pere hesitated about
taking the proffered seat for the City,
Vicary undertook to fill it; finally, Gibbs
pere being warmly pressed, consented to
sit, and Vicary stood aside. But he will
come in by-and-by, when he has
given his fat her a turn.
"Age before honesty, is my
motto," said Vicaby, when I com-
plimented him upon the fine feel-
ing he has shown throughout
these negotiations. "I always
think that we young fellows lose
nothing by giving our elders a
start. My father, you know,
sometime ago wanted to change
the name of our firm. Suggested
it should be called Sons & An-
tony Gibbs. There's something
Late Member for the City. in it; but on the whole, better
leave things as they are. Antony Gibbs & Sons known all over the
world; always embarrassing to change style of an old firm; so, for
the present, at least, we leave things alone. Come along, Pater;
think I '11 take you home now. Never rush wildly into new engage-
ments; you've had the excitement of being sworn in, and signing
the roll of Parliament. You hadn't been in the place ten minutes
before Tra Healy gave you a ohance of voting on a London City Bill,
and that's enough for one night. By-and-by you shall stay all night
and enjoy yourself in Committee on Irish Land Bill."
So Antony Gibbs and Son went off before dinner. Didn't miss
much; grinding away at Irish Land Bill; most soul-depressing ex-
perience of modern life; no heart in it: no reality; Saoe of Queen
Anne's Gate brings up amendment after amendment, and makes
successive speeohes; Seymour Keay does ditto; Shaw-Lefevre
adds new terror to situation by taking voluminous notes which
promise illimitable succession of orations; House empty; Prince
Abtht/k has the full length of Treasury Bench on which to lounge.
Occasionally Division-bell rings; Members troop in by the hundred;
follow their leaders into Lobby right or left, deciding question they
haven't heard debated, and mere drift of whioh two-thirds don't
understand.
Bbeb Fox absent to-night, whioh precludes possibility of flare-up
in Irish Camp. Tim faithful to his post, but laoks inspiration of
contiguity to Brer Fox.
"Paknell's played out," said Tim, referring'in course of evening
to Bbek Fox's reception in his latest run through Ireland. "He
may ramp and roar here, but his game 's up in Ireland."
"And is he resigned to the situation?" I asked.
Tim looked at me, half winking his miraculously preservedlright
eye.
"Did you ever hear. Toby, what the weeping widow saidlto the
parson, who asked, 'Was your husband resigned to die?' 'He
had ter be,' she said, choking a sob."
Business done.— Very little in the Irish Land Bill.
Tuesday. — Mr. G.'s presence at Morning Sitting gave only
fsssible fillip to interminable Debate on Land Purchase Bill. Bbeb
'ox still away, so comparative peace reigns in Irish Camp. Tim
Healy no one to butt his head against; Colonel Nolan too busy
deploying his army of five men; showing them how to retreat in
good order when Division-bell rings, and how, when it is decided
to vote, they shall pass out through one door, maroh in at the
other, cross the floor, and look as muoh as possible as if they were
ten instead of five. T. W. Russell—" Roaring" Russell, as his
old colleague in Temperance fights, Wilfrid Lawson, calls him—
frequently on his legs. At sound of his voice, Mr. G. gets his back
up; interposes interjections and corrections; and presently, when he
can stand it no longer, plunges into a speech.
Another time 8at/ndebson draws him. "I am very sorry," said
Mr. G., who has been itching to speak for last half-hour, "that the
hon. and gallant Gentleman has dragged me into debate by gross
misstatements."
Being there, however, Mr. G. enjoys himself passably well,
grinding Saundkkson to powder, ana hewing Russell to pieoes
before the Lord Strathedbn and Campbell, who are sleeping peace-
fully together in the Gallery. "Like the Babes in the Wood," said

Plunk et, looking up smilingly at the face in the Gallery, which
looks twice as wise when asleep as the ordinary man does in full
possession of his senses.
"I know," Mr. G. continued, in measured accents of polite scorn,
"that the eloquence of the hon, and
gallant Gentleman (meaning Saunder-
son) is as ungovernable as I am afraid
it is sometimes unprofitable. In the ex-
ercise of the understanding which the
Almighty has given him, he has repre-
sented me as being a supporter of this
Bill."
Words cannot convey adequate im-
pression of the subtlety of emotion
conveyed by this unwonted, perhaps
unprecedented, invocation. An unmis-
takeable, though unspoken, indication
of mingled feeling — pity for one so
meagrely endowed, and marvel that,
out of boundless stores, the Deity could,
even in this instance, have been so chary
of gifts.
Business done.—Still less in Com-
mittee on Irish Land Bill.
Thursday. — Rival shows in both
Houses to-night. Lords running the
Newfoundland Delegates at the Bar ; iu
the Commons Budget on. On the
whole, Commons drew the fullest
House, to which Joetm descanted
for nearly three hours. If he'd
taken two, the speeoh would have
been a third less long, and three
times as successful. Still the
Budget oomes but once a year, Roanng Russell,
and Chancellor of the Exchequer feels bound to make the most of
opportunity. Pretty plain sailing for first two hours. Then Joeim
ran aground. It was General Stamps that did it all. Appeared
unexpectedly in long list of details setting forth Estimates for
Revenue in coming year. Nobody ever heard before of the General;
thought, at least, he must belong to the Army Estimates. But Joki m
would have him in, spurs and epaulettes, and all.
"General Stamps," he said, regardless of grammar, "have fallen
off." Joeim, in his loose way, omitted to say off what; presumed
to be his horse. House not sorry to hear it; had enough of the
mysterious warrior. But he was up again a few minutes' later.
"General Stamps," Joeim continued, in his airy fashion, "apart
from the Death Duties, I reduce from £6,700,000 to £5,900,000."
"Better reduce (him to the ranks at once," said Admiral Field,
who is a terrible martinet.
But Joeim took no notice of the suggestion; floundered along,
bungling terribly. Committtee tried to help him out; that didn't
help matters much. To have a Member in one part of the House
filling up an awkward pause by suggesting "dried fruit," another
"coffee," a third " rum," and a fourth "probate duty," when after
all, Jokim was thinking of the Inoome .Tax [or General Stamps,
evidently not designed to advance matters.
"The Committee knows what I mean," Joeim said, piteonsly,
looking round out of a morass a little deeper than he'd been in lately.
But that is exactly what the Committee didn't do.
"Then," said Joeim, "you'll understand the figures when you
read them in the papers to-morrow." Something in that; House
mollified; still can't help thinking that if it is to wait till next
morning to read report of Chancellor's Budget Speech in order to
understand his statements, some preliminary time might be saved in
the evening.
Business done.—Budget brought in.
Friday Night.—Missed Old MoBALirr from Treasury Bench;
looked in his room; found him in arm-chair, collapsed, by fire-
place, with copy of Morning Advertiser in his hand.
"What's the matter?" I asked. "Surely you've not been
reading Joeim's Budget Speeoh right through!" He certainly
looked as if he had.
"No,Toby," he said; "it's not that; it'a the Leader. Haven't
you seen what the Morning Advertiser says about me ?' For the
first time in our recollection he (that's me) bears on his political
escutcheon a deep smudge of dishonour': and that's all because
Joeim wouldn't take a penny off a barrel of beer, and twopence
off a gallon of spirits. It's the injustice I feel most acutely. It
doesn't seem fair that Mr. Buno should try to intimidate Jokim
by abusing me."
"It is hard," I said; "but it's no use sitting moping here.
Come along into House; they're in Committee on the Land Bill
an hour or two of that '11 freshen you up." And it did.
Business done.—In Committee on the Irish Land Bill.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A FIRST VISIT TO THE ' NAVERIES."
"Shiver my timbers!" said the Scribe.
"Hani down my yard-arm with a marling-spike!" cried the
Artist.
And with these strictly nantioal expressions, two of Mr. Punch's
Own entered the Royal Naval Exhibition, whioh now oconpies the
larger portion of the grounds of the Military Hospital, Chelsea.
That so popular a snow should be
allowed to occupy so large a site speaks
wonders for the amiability of the
British Public When the Sodgeries
appeared last Tear, it was, so to speak,
with fear ana trembling that the
powers that were" appropriated a little
of the ground usually over-run by the
Nobility and Gentry of the Pimlioo
Road and its vioinity; or, rather, by
their haughty offspring. This year
the tough old sea-dogs of the Admi-
ralty have had no hesitation in taking
what they required, apparently with-
out causing comment, much less objec-
tion. And the result? In lieu of the
dusty arena of 1890, scarcely large
enough for a ladies cricket-match,
there appears in 1891 an enolosure con-
taining lakes and lighthouses, pano-
ramas, and full-size models of men-
of-war 1 And the Publio take their
exclusion philosophically, either paying
their shillings at the door, or attempting
to get a view of the hoofs of the nantioal
horses through the gaps in the sur-
rounding hoardings.
The Scribe and the Artist, having been
ordered by He Who Must Be Obeyed in
the world generally, and at 85, Fleet
Street, in particular, to make a sort of
preliminary cruise through the wonders
of the (Admiralty) Deep, hastened from
the inviting grounds into the main
building, with its pictures, its plans, and last, but (it is only just to
say) least, its piokles. The first object that attracted their favourable
attention was a trophy of arms, representing the fashions of the past
and the present. On one side were shrapnel and magazine rifles,
on the other flint-locks and the ordnance of an age_ long gone by.
Next they passed through the Arctic seotion, wherein they found
dummies drawing a sledge through the canvas snow of a corded-off
North .Pole. Then they entered the Pioture Galleries oalled after
Nelson and Benbow, wherein magnificent paintings by Powell,
full of smoke and action, served as an appropriate background to the
collection of plate, lent by that gallant sailor-warrior and industrious
collector of well-considered trifles, H.K.H. the Duke of Edinburgh.
They glanced at the relics of Trafalgar, and then hurried away to the
flow k Gallery, which, containing as it did specimens of the imple-
ments used in the game of golf, might have as appropriately been
christened the Wherefore. Next they skirted a corridor full of plans,
and here they discovered that the Committee of the Exhibition must
be wags, every Jaok Tar of them I This corridor was olose to the
Dining-rooms, and the Committee (ha! ha! ha!) had called it (he!
he! he!) after Cook! (Ho! ho I ho!) Oh, the wit of it! How the
Members of the Executive must have nudged one another in the ribs
as the quaint idea dawned upon them! And how they must have
laughed, too, on the Opening Day, when the Guard of Honour,
presenting arms, and the " Greenwioh Boys " singing " Ye Marineri of
England" were drenched in the rain! And wnat a capital notion
it was on that occasion to put " the Representatives of the Fourth
Estate" (no doubt oalled by them, with many a sly twinkle of the
eye, "the Press Gang") into a pen that soon, thanks to a series
of water-spouts, assumed the appearance of a tank!
After leaving the Galleries, the Scribe and the Artist looked up at
the model^of Eddystone Lighthouse, and entered a shed declared to be
an "Arctio Soene." Here they were reminded by the introduced ship
of those happy days of their boyhood spent in the toy-shops of the
Lowther Aroade. Next they visited the Panorama of Trafalgar, and
revelled in the carnage of a sea-fight that only required Margate in
the distance to be entirely oonvinoing. They glanced at the arena,
and gazed with awe at the lake whioh is to be devoted to the
manoeuvring of miniature ironclads. It will be interesting to note
whether these mimio oombats will hold their own in the coming season
against the introduction of capsized clowns, drenched old women,
and oomio police. Keeping the best for the last, the Scribe and the
Artist now entered the model of the Victory— a really admirable
exhibition. There they saw before them the old battle-ship with its
full equipment, as it was in the days of Nelson—when that deathless

hero expected every Englishman (not excluding even those passing
the Custom House—as the Committee would say) "to do his duty.
To make the illusion complete, the great sea-captain was observed
dying in the cook-pit in the agonies of wax. And to think that
this work was exeouted by a firm of house-deoorators! Why,
who would not, after this, nave his back drawing-room converted
into the quarter-deck of the Shannon, and his spare bed-room into
a tiny reproduction of the Battle of Copenhagen!
The Scribe and the Artist, on their
visit, were invited by all sorts and
conditions of men to partake of cham-
pagne. The moment it was discovered
that they were "connected with the
Press," the offerers of hospitality were
absolutely overwhelming. But, obey-
ing the best traditions of their order,
they sternly, but courteously, refused
all refreshment. It is fortunate they
pursued this course, for had they
received the entirely disinterested
kindness of their would-be hosts, their
recollections of the marvels of the
Royal Naval Exhibition would no
doubt have been of the haziest charac-
ter imaginable. As it was, they were
able to take their departure through
the main entranoe with some show of
dignity, and not in a less imposing
manner (as tne Committee—Cook's
Gallery near the Dining-rooms — hoi
ho I ho! ha I ha 1 ha 1—would probably
and amusingly suggest), by Tito Street.

duty to Art and the British Publio
if he did not place on imperishable
record his notes of the exceptionally
brilliant Royal Academy Banquet of
last Saturday. H.R.H. the Prince of
Wales made one of his best and
briefest speeohes, in which he feelingly alluded to the late Sir Edgar
Boehm, R. A. Never was the President, Sir Frederick, more eloquent,
or his themes more varied; for this ocoasion is noteworthy as being the
first time in the history of this great annual representative gathering
that the toast of Music and the Drama has been duly honoured. Sir
Arthur Sullivan responded for the first, and Henry Irving for
the seoond. Both made excellent speeohes. Sir Arthur's solo was
most effective j his notes were in his head; he gave us several varia-
tions on the original theme, and cleverly played upon one word in
saying that musio had been "instrumental" on various historical
occasions. Henry Irving followed suit; he spoke of Mrs. Siddons,
Sir Joshua Reynolds, and of a professional gentleman mentioned,
we believe, by Hamlet as having been, some considerable time ago,
"a man of parts," that is an Actor, in Rome. It was a great success.
Sir Frederick then proposed the Lord Mayor, which may be briefly
expressed as " a toast with a Savory to follow." For '' The Visitors,"
Lord Justice Bowen, oatohing sight of the President's classical
pioture (No. 232), made a happy hit about the delights of a honey-
moon in the Infernal Regions, ending in the return of Ceres to her
mother by order of the Court above. Finally, the President, in
summing up the losses to Art during the past year, paid a graceful
tribute to the memory of Charles Keene, who, but a short while
ago, was our fellow-worker on the staff of Mr. Punch. With a
hopeful allusion to the Storage of Artistio Foroe in the near future,
the President ooncluded; but this Banquet of 1891 will long live in
the recolleotion of all whose privilege it was to be present on so
memorable an occasion.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. PUNCH'S POCKET IBSEN.
(Condensed and Revised Version by Mr. P.'s Own Harmless Ibsenitt.)'
No. III.-HEDDA GABLER.
Act. III.
Scene.—The same Room, but—it being evening—darker than ever—
The crape curtains are drawn. A Servant, with black ribbons m
her cap, and red eyes, comes in and lights the gas quietly and care-
fully. Chords are heard on the piano in the back Drawing-room.
Presently Hedda comes in and looks out into the darkness. A
short pause. Enter George Tesman.
George. I am so uneasy about poor Lovbobg. Fancy 1 he is not at
home. Mrs. Elvsted told me he had been here early this morning,
so I suppose you gave him back his manuscript, eh?
Hedda (cold and immovable, supported by arm-chair). No, I put
it on the fire instead.
George. On the fire! Lovbobg's wonderful new book that he read
to me at Brack's party, when we had that wild revelry last night!
Fancy that! But, I say, Hedda—isn't that
rather— eh? Too bad, you know—really. A
great work like that. How on earth did you
come to think of it P
Hedda (suppressing an almost imperceptible
smile). Well, dear George, you gave me a toler-
ably strong hint.
George. Me? Well, to be sure—that is a
joke!, kWhy, I only said that I envied him for
writing such a book, and it would put me en-
tirely in the shade if it came out, and if any-
thing was to happen to it, I should never forgive
myself, as poor Lovbobg couldn't write it all over
again, and so we must take the greatest care of
it! And then I left it on a chair and went away
—that was all 1 And you went and burnt the
book all up! Bless me, who would have ex-
pected it P
Hedda. Nobody, you dear simple old soul!
But I did it for your sake—it was, love,
Gkokqe t
George (in an outburst between doubt
and joy). Hedda, you don't mean that!
Tour love takes such queer forms some-
times. Yes, but yea—(laughing in excess
of joy)x why, you must be fond of me I
Just think of that now 1 Well, you are
fun, Hedda! Look here, I must just
run and tell the housemaid that—[she
will enjoy the joke so, eh P
Hedda (coldly, in self-command). It
is surely not necessary, even for a clever
Norwegian man of letters in a realistic
social drama, to make quite such a fool
of himself as all that?
George. No, that's true too. Perhaps
we'd better keep it quiet — though I
must tell Aunt Julie—it will make her
so happy to hear that you burnt a manu-
script on my account! And, besides, I
should like to ask her whether that's a usual thing with young wives.
(Looks uneasy and pensive again.) But poorold Ejlert's manuscript!
Oh Lor, you know! Well, well I [Mrs. Elvsted comes in.
Mrs. E. Oh, please, I'm so uneasy about dear Mr. Lovbobg.
Something has happened to him, I'm sure I
Judge Brack (comes in from the hall, with a new hat in his hand).
You have guessed it, first time. Something has.'
Mrs. E. Oh, dear, good gracious 1 What is it? Something
distressing, I'm certain of it! [Shrieks aloud.
Brack (pleasantly). That depends on how one takes it. He has
shot himself, and is in a hospital now, that's all!
George (sympathetically). That's sad, eh? poor old Lovbobg!
Well, 1 am cut up to hear that. Fancy, though, eh?
Hedda. Was it through the temple, or through the breast? The
breast? Well, one can do it beautifully through the breast, too.
Do you know, as an advanced woman, I like an act of that sort—it 'a
so positive, to have the oourage to settle the account with himself—
it's beautiful, really 1
Mrs. E. Oh, Hedda, what an odd way to look at it I But never
mind poor dear Mr. Lovbobg now. What tee 've got to do is to see
if we can't put his wonderful manuscript, that he said he had torn
to pieces, together again. (Takes a bundle of small pages out of the
pocket of her mantle.) There are the loose scraps he dictated it to
me from. I hid them on the chance of some such emergency. And
dear Mr. Tesxian and I were to put our heads together, I do think
something might come of it.
George. Fanoy! I will dedicate my life—or all I can spare of
it—to the task. I seem to feel I owe him some slight amends,
perhaps. No use crying- over spilt milk, eh, Mrs. Elvsted? We '11
sit down—just you and I—in the baok drawing-room, and see if you
can't inspire me as you did him, eh?
Mrs. E. Oh, goodness, yes! I should like it—if it only might be
possible!
[George and Mrs. E. go into the back Drawing-room and become
absorbed in eager conversation; Hedda sits in a chair in the
front room, and a little later Brack crosses over to her.
Hedda (in a low tone). Oh, Judge, what a relief to know that
everything—including Lovbobg's pistol—went off so well I In the
breast I Isn't there a veil of unintentional beauty in that? Such an
act of voluntary oourage, too I
Brack (smiles). Hm I—perhaps, dear Mrs. Hedda
Hedda (enthusiastically). But wasn't it sweet of him 1 To have
the oourage to live his own life after his own fashion—to break away
from the banquet of life—so early and so drunk I A beautiful act
like that does appeal to a superior woman's imagination 1
Brack. Sorry to shatter your poetical illusions, little Mrs. Hedda,
but, as a matter of faot, our lamented
friend met his end under other circum-
stances. The shot did not strike him in
the breast—but [Pauses.
Hedda (excitedly). General Gablkr's
pistols I I might have known it! Did
they ever shoot straight? Where was
he nit, then?
Brack (in a discreet undertone). A
little lower down I
Hedda. Oh, how disgusting 1 — how
vulgar!—how ridiculous!—like every-
thing else about me!
Brack. Yes, we 're realistic types_ of
human nature, and all that—but a trifle
squalid, perhaps. And why did you
give Lovbobg your" pistol, when it was
certain to be traced bv the police? For
a charming cold-blooded woman with a
dear head and no scruples, wasn't it
just a lee tie foolish?
Hedda. Perhaps; but I wanted him
to do it beautifully, and he didn't! Oh,
I've just admitted that I did give him
the pistol—how annoyingly unwise of
me! Now I'm in your power, I suppose?
Brack. Precisely — for

it's not easy to understand. _ But it's

everlasting bores settled?'
inevitable, and you know how'you
anything approaching scandal. All _
past proceedings show that. (To George
and Mrs. E., who come in together from
the back-room.) Well, how are you get-
ting on with the reconstruction of poor
Lovbobg's great work, eh?
George. Capitally; we've made out
the first two parts already. And really,
Hidda, I do.believe Mrs. Elvsted is
inspiring me: I begin to feel it coming
on. Fancy that!
Mrs. E. Yes, goodness! Hedda, won't it be lovely if I can. I
mean to try so hard!
Hedda. Do, you dear little silly rabbit; and while you are trying
I will go into the baok drawing-room and lie down.
[She goes into the back-room and draws the curtains. Short
pause. Suddenly she is heard playing " The Bogie Man"
within on the piano.
George. But, dearest Hedda, don't play " The Boat's Man" this
evening. As one of my aunts is deal, and poor old Lovbobg has
shot himself, it seems just a little pointed, eh?
Hedda (puts her head out between the curtains). All right! I '11 be
quiet after this. I'm going to practise with the late General
Gablek's pistol!
[Closes the curtains again; George gets behind the stove. Judge
Brack under the table, and Mrs. Elvsted under the sofa.
A shot is heard within.
George (behind the stove). Eh, look here, I tell you what—she's hit
me.' Think of that I
[Hi* legs are visibly agitated for a short time. Another shot
is heard.
Mrs. E. (under the sofa). Oh, please, not me! Oh, goodness, now
I can't inspire anybody any more. Oh!
[Her feet, which can be seen under the valance, quiver a little,
and then are suddenly still.
Brack (vivaciously, from under the table). I say, Mrs. Hedda, I'm
coming in every evening—we will have great fun here togeth

walls, which had fallen, like those of Jericho,
to the sound of the trumpet, were put away
oarefully, for alteration and repairs. The

BEPABTEE TO A SPOUSE.
Both parties in the recent extraordinary abduction case, where a
Mrs. Jones was carried off down a rope-ladder at midnight by her
own husband, Mr. Jones, have published statements defending their
own line of conduct. The following is Mrs. Jones's version:—
"As public opinion appears to have erroneously taken my—so-
oalled—husband s side, as far as I can gather from my having been
twice chased through the streets by an infuriated mob, and four
separate attempts having been made to blow up my house with
nitro-glycerine, I feel compelled to explain—with muoh reluctance—
why it was that I declined to live with Mr. Jones.
To begin with, it was only under the most awful threats that Mr.
Jones prevailed on me to become his wife. His words—I remember
them well—were, 'My darling, you know how tenderly I adore you:
if you don't marry me at once 11l break every bone in your body 1
He then snatched my bonnet, a new one, from my head, and so acted
on my nerves that 1 went off to the Registry Office and was married.
That he was actuated by merely mercenary motives is proved by the
fact that the gratuity (of half-a-crown), which he presented to the
Registry Clerk, he actually borrowed from me .'i I knew him already
to be unprincipled; but never until that moment had it flashed upon
me that he was a fortune-hunter! However, as he had the drawing-
room poker with him—he kept it concealed up his back during the
ceremony at the Registry Offloe—I did not ;at that time say any-
thing, but handed him the coin. I do not know if I should have left
him at once, had he not aggravated the baseness of his conduct by
using the vulgar expression, 'Fork it out quick 1' But I regret to
say that his origin is painfully low. Whereas, anybody who con-
sults my relatives will hear from them that they belong to the very
highest County Families. Indeed, he would hear it all day long if
he lived with them, as I do!
"On the day of the abduction, I was treated barbarously! Even
the cab in which 1 was taken off was, so the coaohman informed me,
'put down to my account.' Oh, had I but guessed the truth about
Mr. Jones when I went to the Altar—I mean the Registry Offioe!
Supper consisted of cold mutton and pickles (!) which latter he upset,
and I had a dress ruined."
On perusing the above, Mr. Jones decided that he could no longer
keep silence, and has made public the subjoined explanation:—
"When I first saw Mrs. Jones—then Miss Thompson—her youth-
ful grace quite captivated me. Her age was under fifty-six, and
mine was just sixty. She was, in fact, as I told her at the time,
almost old enough to know her own mind. It is true that she was
wealthy, but that had no influence on my conduct. On the contrary
I felt it as a positive drawback, as my domestic ideal has always been
Love in a Cottage I But as she was bent upon our marrying, I
agreed to waive this objection.
"In proof of this assertion I need only say that on the very day
after our first meeting, I received the following letter:—
"'Priceless and Adorable Pet,—How are your little tootsy-
wootsioums P Did they get wet in conducting me home after that
delicious interview P If so, and you were to catch cold in your
precious head, I should never forgive myself. Oh, oome and see me
soon! Your Own, fill Death, Angelina.'
"Possibly I may be blamed for publishing this letter. I do it for
her sake, not for mine. Even now I believe that, were I left alone
with her for an hour, with none of her relatives nor a policeman
near, I could persuade her to retract her calumnious statement about
the poker. I conclude by saying that it is my belief that her relatives,
who are all of them powerful mesmerists, have hypnotised her!"
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
My Face is My Fortune, by Messrs. Philips and Fendall.
Why don't they agree to spell both names with an " F," and make
it Fillips and Fendall. _ I fancy that Fendall couldn't do without
the sensational fillips. This story excites curiosity throughout the first
volume, and then, in the other volume, satisfies it in so disappointing
and commonplace a fashion as to suggest the idea that one of the
authors, becoming weary of his share in the work, suddenly ohucked
it up, and said, " Oh, bother 1 let's finish anyhow ;" and then the
other collaborateur, whichever it was, did finish it as best and as
quickly as he could. There is evidence of laziness or of lack of in-
vention in the story. If it were for the first time in fiction that a
secret is learnt by some one hiding behind some pantomime plants
in a conservatory, then too muoh praise could not be bestowed on
the ingenious devisers of so strong and original a situation. But
as " we know that situation,—he comes from Sheffield." and as it
has done duty some scores of times before, on or off the stage,
why, the thoroughgoing novel-reader shakes his head and asks,
"Couldn't they nave devised something better than this between
themP" "I expected muoh from this combination in Authorship,
and am disappointed," says the candid Baron de Book-Worms.

"Mori changes, too, to come afore we have
done with changes I"
Ah 1 I said that to good Mister Mould years
agone; which'ow memory ranges
All over them dear "Good Old Times," as I
wish them wos back agen, bless 'em!
Whioh the new ones ain't much to my mind;
there's too many fresh "monthlies" to
mess 'em.
No; monthlying ain't wot it were; the per-
fession's too open, a lamp.
Nnsses now ain't no more like old Sairey, no
not than the old Aldgit Pump
Like the Criatial Pallnses fountings. A
Pilgjian's Projiss is life,
And a Nuss ain't no more like a Noss than a
Wife now resembles a Wife.
Heighol Whioh it's no use a frettin'. But
Fondlings! Ah. well, I did think
Our respectable fam'lies, though mixed, from
si eh ojus demeaning would shrink,
Whioh no greater hinsult to me, the old
reglar, could well be deviged;
And though I'ye to live and to learn, I
confess as this turn 1 'm serpriged.
A Fondling 1! I Turned up unbeknownst
on a doorstep permiskus, no doubt.
And then to adopt him I Oh dear, wot the
plague is our Party about?
Wien to monthly to it were my pride; its
legitermit offspring I've nussed
Many years with the greatest success, but
to-day I feels flurried and fussed,
And my eyes is Saint Polge's fontin with
tears, and this brat is their source;
As it isn't no offspring of ourn—of the fam'ly
I mean, Ma'am, in course;
But a Brummagem bantling, picked hup.
as were not worth its swaddlin' and
food,
And I never yet knowed any brat from that
source as turned out any good.
Missis G., Mum, it's all a mistake, as you
know in your 'art all the same,
For you turned up your nose at the child
when Jos Chakberxinq give him a
name,
Afore we was' thick with his set, when you
snubbed him, and laughed him to
soorn,
And heaped naughty names on this kid, as
you swore was his nat'ral fust-born .
And now you come dandling, and doddling,
and patting the brat on the 'ed,
And forgetting the things as you promiged,
and backing on all as you said.
Missis G., you do raly amaze mel This
comes of our precious mix-up;
Whioh the child's no more like one of ourn
than a pug's like a tarrier-pup.
In the best-regulated o' fam'lies things will
go askew, I'm aweer:
As I says to my friend Mrs. Harris, as says
to me, "Sairet, my dear,
You looks dragged, my sweet oreetur," she
says. "Missis Harris," I mikes 'er
reply,
"When the 'art in one's buzzum beats 'of,
there's exouge for the tear in one's heye.
Which wales isn't in it for worrit, my love,
with your poor old pal, Bairry,
Along o' the Fam'ly," I says; "as things do
seem to go that contrairey,
My services now ain't required, with ' adop-
tions' all over the shop.
From Brummagem, yus, and elsewhere*: and
I ast' Where is this thing to stop?'
Ritchie's ' pick-up' was tryin', most tryin*;
and as to those bad Irish brats,
As Balfour interjuoed—dear! jest fancy our
Party adopting small Pats 1
And now this here Brummagem babby! You
say he's a promising cheild,
Missis G., and you 're learning to love him!'
All this makes old Sairet feel wild.
It's wus than kidnapping, this bizness of

You're musing a wiper, I say, and you'll

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED PROM THE DIARY OP TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, April 27.—" Well, I never!" said
George Elliot, beaming on House from back bench; "have known
Habcoubt man and boy for forty
yean; seen him in divers moods;
watched him through various
occupations. These have been bo
many that I have had time to
forget he was once Chancellor of
the Ezohequer • but he was, and
upon my word, listening to him
to-night, and knowing something
about figures myself, I believe
he would have made a splash at
the Treasury."
Jokim doesn't enjoy performance
quite so much as Genial Geoboe.
Oddly enough. Budget Night,
which ought to be the apex of com-
fort and glory for Chancellor of
the Exchequer, is with him ever
the season of tribulation. House
of Commons is, regarded as audi-
enoe, always at its best on Budget
Night, will laugh immoderately
at feeblest joke uttered by Chaw,
cbllob; cheers to the echo his
moral sentiments; sits enraptured when he soars into eloquence; and
is undisguisedly grateful when he has completed his peroration.
Jokim's muddle of Thursday night made the best of. Opposition
silenced by promised legislation establishing Free Education. Every-
thing in .sunshine-glow of prosperity. Thought! Jokih might keep
some of the sunbeams for himself. Then comes Habcoubt with the
abhorred shears of faots and figures, and slits the thin-spun web of
Joint's ingenious fancy; shows that, instead of a surplus, he has,
when honest arithmetic is set to work, a deficit; instead of increasing
the rate of reduction of National Debt, he has done less in that
direction than his predecessors; and that whilst expenditure on Army
and Navy has exceeded any figures reached by former Chancellors of
the Exchequer, the floating debt is ever growing.
Jokim sits on Treasury Bench affecting the virtue of a smile
though he has it not. Wriggles like a snailjunder dispensation of
■alt. When Habcoubt finished, Henby Fowleb stepped in, and
with fresh array of figures and new marshalling of argument, com-
pleted the demolition of Jokim's system of finance. Mr. G. looked
smilingly on, delighting in the energy and aptitude of his Young
Men. Jo— '' ''' ''

Genial George.
Right lion, (Jentleman need not go
so far afield - will have pretty tough job in answering Habcoubt."
A pretty scene: admirable Parliamentary play. Oddly enough
boxes empty; stalls a wilderness; pit only half fulL Energies of
House so sapped with dreary flood of talk on Irish Land Bill cannot
be reanimated even for a brisk battle over the Budget.
Business done.—Jokim pummelled to pulp.
Tuesday.—Old Mobalttt walked out of House just now, his baok
suffused with sense of duty done, alike to Queen and Country.
Irish Land Bill, which, as Campbell-Bannebman says, makes a
Moated Grange of House of Commons, on again all day. Sags or
Queen Anns; s Gats and his Party active as usual. The Pabtt a
little doubtful of the Sage. Sometimes, in blessed intervals of
silence, is discovered gazing on a bald space on baok of Sage's head,
striving, as it were, to pieroe through this weak spot, and discover
what is in the Sage's mind. The Sage in outward manner most
deferential and encouraging. Misses no opportunity of publicly
applauding him. It is true that when the Sage has got him on his
legs, starting afresh on new Amendment, he seizes the opportunity
to slink out of the House, and take another cigarette, quite oertain
that the Pabtt is good for half-an-hour. This, and one or two
other little things, create a suspicion in the mind of the Pabtt, who
was not brought up in India for nothing. Wilpbid Lawson, who
sits close by, and keenly watches progress of events, says he has no
doubt the time will come when the Pabtt will revolt.
"KKAT,"says Wilfbid, "occupies a strategical position, whioh
S'ves him a great pull over Labbt. His respeoted Leader sits on the
inch immediately below him. Some day Seymour Eeat's wild
Mahratta blood may boil over, an unsuspected scimitar may flash
forth from his trouser pocket, and the Sage's head, falling gory on
the floor of the House, may gently, from mere force of habit, roll
in the direction of Queen Anne s Gate."
"For a real sanguinary-minded man," said Ritchie, to whom I
told this story, "give me a teetotaller."
The Pabtt, with some assistance from Windbag Sxxton,
sitting till quarter to seven. By this time, all Amendments to
Clause 3 being wearily worn ott,[opport unity just left to pass Clause
before Sitting adjourned. Question put that Clause 3 pass. Then
Sage, smelling obtrusively of cigarettes, interposed, and declared it
"would be indecent" to aooept the Clause without further discus-
sion. Nothing House shrinks from just now more abjectly than
from charge of indecency. Accordingly debate stood over, and
Thursday may, if the Sage and his Party please, and the Closure is
not invoked, be appropriated for farther disonssion of Clause 3.
Old Morality might have moved Closure at twelve minutes to
seven, and carried Clause 3. Committee naturally expected he would.
But Old Morality had another card up his sleeve. At very last
moment, whilst Members trooped out, and it was thought all was
over, Old Mobalttt gave notice of motion to take the whole time of
House, including Tuesday and Friday nights' evening sittings.
"I think you had them there," I said, as we walked across to
Grosvenor Plaoe.
"Yes, Tobt," he said, a little flush mantling his modest face;
"we've given them rope enough, and now we'll hang them.
They've had their run, now we '11 take ours. It's the main thing I
always look to. Never forget when I was still in the seminary
writing out copy of verses about a shipwreck. A graphio scene; the
riven vessel, the raging seas, the panic-stricken crowd on deok, and
then this little self-drawn picture of the sole survivor, the one man
left to tell the story:
Some fell upon their bended knees I But I fell to on bread and cheese;
And others fell down fainting, | For that, Sir, was the main thing.
It's the bread and cheese I look to, Tobt, dear boy. For others the
glory of debate, tie prize of Parliamentary oratory. Give me the
bread and cheese of Beeing business advancing, and I'm content."
Business done.—Once more Committee on Irish Land Bill.
Thursday.—A pretty little game on to-night. Old Morality
moved his Resolution taking power to appropriate Tuesdays and
Fridays evening sittings, and all Wednesdays for Irish Land Bill.
In ordinary circumstances there would have been stormy protest led
from Front Opposition Benoh against this inroad on time of private
Members. Other fish to fry to-night. Wednesday week assigned
for Seoond Reading of Woman's Suffrage Bill; if Government take
that day for Irish Land Bill, obviously oan't be utilised for further-
ance of Woman's Rights. This an awkward question for some
Members; don't like it, but daren't vote against it. Here's oppor-
tunity of getting rid of it by side-wind. Not necessary in arranging
Sroceedings to mention Suffrage Bill, or even Wednesday, 13th of
[ay. It was principle for which Members struggled; "the prin-
ciple of uniformity," as Mr. G. beautifully put it "Let us," he
said, though perhaps not quite in this phrase, "go the whole hog or
none; take all the Wednesdays, or leave them."
Pretty to see Old Morality protesting against this unprecedented
acoess of generosity. The very picture, as McEwan said, of a good
man struggling with the adversity of overwhelming good fortune.
Was prepared to take a Wednesday here and there; but, really, too
much to appropriate every one. "Not at all— not at all," said Mr. G.
But it was only under compulsion of a Division that he consented
to aooept the endowment. In meanwhile, the Woman's Suffrage
Debate on Wednesday week snuffed out, and final opportunity of
Session lost.
"I'm inclined," said Wm. Woodall, "as a rule, to take kindly
views of my fellow men, to put the best construction upon their
actions; but, upon my word, I'm not satisfied in my own mind that
we advocates of Woman's Rights have not been made the viotims of
deep and dastardly design."
Order! Order I" said Courtney; "no more am I."
Business done.— Woman's Rights men dished.
Friday.—Brer Fox looked,in to-night, and, finding Brer Rabbit
absent, undertook charge of Irish affairs. Desirous of introducing
novelty into situation, began by patronising Prince Arthub. "So
conciliatory, you know; so anxious to meet the views of Irish
Members; really, they ought to meet him half-way, and ^ refrain
from annoying nun by unnecessary Amendments."
Brer Fox's voice faltered as he spoke, and, bringing round his
tail, he gently brushed away a falling tear. Unfortunately for
him, Tm Healt present. Tin jumped up, and fell upon his
anoient chief, flouting his counsel, and repudiating his right to
leadership. Effect upon Brer Fbz something like that whioh
followed on the flight of the piece of old red sandstone whioh struok
in the abdomen a gentleman who chanced to be standing round.
The subsequent proceedings interested him no more. He walked
out, and was not seen again. "Exceedingly rude man," he said;
"never come near Trie Healt but I feel an infinite yearning for a
fire-escape." Business done.—Land Bill again.

Scheme, to the Tories.

THE RIGHTS AND WRONGS OF LABOUR,
{At the service of the Ch-nc-U-r of the Exch-qu-r, if he purposes writing a
Prophetic Romance.)
Macaulat's New Zealander had arrived prematurely. London
Bridge was not reduced to its centre pier, and St. Paul's Cathedral
was certainly not in ruins. Still there was an uncanny look about
town. On the Embankment electric tram-cars were running, but
they seemed to be little patronised. Here and there he noticed a
pedestrian leisurely going his way, but the side-walks appeared, to
all intents and purposes, abandoned. At length he reached a garden-
peat, upon which was sprawling a Typical Working Man. The New
Zealander gave this interesting individual "Good morning," and
made some common-place remark about the weather.
"Fine day!" returned the T. W. M., rather surlily. "Well,
what does it matter to me ?j [If it rains, I stay at home; if it don't,
why I don't either."
I am a stranger seeking for information," explained the New
Zealander; " so I am sure yon will exouse me if I ask you how much
do you pay for your house P"
",Pay for my house!" ejaculated the T. W. M. "Why, nothing
of course! And I pay nothing too for my sons at Oxford, and the
girls at Cambridge. And I get] my clothes free, and my food comes
in gratuitously. Why, you must be a stranger if you don't know
that! Why everything and anything is paid by the Government-
out of the Inoome Tax.
"And don't you ever work?"
"Work! bless you, no. I can't afford to work! If I did, I
should have to pay the Income Tax myself!" returned the T. W. M.,
with a grin.
"Then who does contribute to this evidently highly-important
source of revenue?"
"Why, the professional men, under Schedule D!" oried the hardy
son of toil. "The authors with families, and the City clerks. All
that set, you know. They pay the Inoome Tax, sure enough. It 'b
as muoh as they can do to keep bodies and souls together. But some-
body must pay—why not they P—pay for themselves—and for me!"
The Dumb Show.—It sounds odd that the serious pantomime,
L'Enfant Prodigue, the play without words, should be "the talk of
London."

LEAVES FROM A CANDIDATE'S DIARY.
"George Hotel," Billsbury, Friday, April 25<A.—Arrived this
morning in order to attend a " Monstre Open Air Conservative Fete,"
whioh was held in the grounds of the Billsbury Summer Palace.
The programme was a very attractive one. First, there was a " re-
ception of town and county delegates and their ladies" by the Earl
and Countess of Rochevieille. The Earl is a scrubby little fellow
of about sixty, who looks more
like an old-clothes-man than
anything else. Norman noses
—at least their descendants in
this generation—are curiously
like the Semitic variety some-
times. The name is pro-
nounced "Rovail," and both
the Earl and Countess get blue
with rage if anybody makes a
mistake about it, as nearly all
the delegates did. They stood
on a raised dais, and received
delegates' addresses to the
number of about thirty. Lady
Kociieyietlle is a stout lady
—very. It was a blazing hot
day, and she was " overcome"
just as she was shaking hands
with Colonel and Mrs. Chob-
kle, who were accompanied
by Benjamin Disbaeli
Canvas and Scrutiny. Chobexe. The rest of the
Chokkle family, including Williamina Henrietta Smith Chobexe,
who was in a nurse's arms, were somewhere about, the grounds look-
ing for the " Magic Haunts of the Fairy Bnlbul," and eating enormous
quantities of macaroons, whioh I had given them. Colonel Chobkle
rather lost his head when Lady R. collapsed. He made an effort to
pick her up, but had to drop her heavily on the boards of the dais.
Eventually, however, she was carried away and revived, and the
proceedings went on. There were Conservative merry-go-rounds,
Conservative negro-minstrels, Conservative acrobats and Conservative
dancing bears, distributed about the grounds. I was taken about by
Alderman Moffat and Hollebone. who introduced me right and left
to'hundreds of my supporters and their wives and daughters. At the
end of it all I felt as if I had got a heavy sort of how-do-you-do smile
regularly glued on my face. One of my chief supporters is an under-
taker named Jobson. Hollebone brought him up to me and said,'' Mr.
Jobson, permit me to introduce you to our popular young Candidate,
Mr. Pattle. Mr. Pattle let me have the honour of introducing yon
to our popular young undertaker, Mr. Jobson." Gave me rather a
shook, but Jobson seemed quite a pleasant man.' His wife was there
too, gorgeously dressed in red plush with an Indian shawl on her
shoulders, and a sealskin muff. She must have felt the heat horribly.
Later in the afternoon there was a political meeting, at whioh we
all spoke, but we had to make it short, as everybody was anxious
to get away to the "Refined Musioal Milange (with incidental
dances) of the Sisters Wilkins," whioh was held in a special 1 y erected
tent. Fireworks, illuminations, and dancing, ended the affair.
April 26.—Was made an Oddfellow to-day. Initiation didn't last
long. Chobxle and Jkbbam were initiated with me, and we all had
to make speeches afterwards, declaring our devotion to the great
cause of Oddfellowship. Afterwards sentiments were called for.
The only one I remember was given by a man called Tab set, a
tailor, who seems to be rather famous for this kind of thing. After
holding his hand to his head for some time, and knitting his brows, he
cleared his throat, and said, in a loud voice,—" May the tear of true
sympathy crystallise as it falls, and be worn as a radiant jewel upon
the finger of affliction." This was vociferously applauded. I con-
gratulated Tabset afterwards, and paid him a compliment about it.
He told me he found it a great relief, after a hard day's work in the
shop, to throw off a sentiment or two. He's going to publish a book
of them, and I've had to subscribe for six copies, 'at half a guinea?eaoh.
Fbom a Watchful Obsebveb.—Sib, — The "other day I saw
advertised in a shop-window, "The Invisible Trouser Stretcher."
Who wears " Invisible Trousers"? Do you remember the story of
The Emperor of China's Clothes t—when they all oried, "He's got
'em on," and he hadn't. That Invisible Trousers should exist is
quite enough stretch of imagination without any further stretcher.—
Yours, The Dat Watchman.
Mbs. R. at the Opeba.—Mrs. Ramsbotham Junior went to hear
La Traviata. She expressed her sympathy with Violetia between
two Gourmands. Remarking on the touching finish to the con-
verted Traviata's career, Mrs. R. observed that it reminded her of
the poet's line about" She who stopped to cough, remained to pray."

any amount of symbols thrown in. The words flow quite easily; you cover
scores of pages. Then you read it over again next morning. If you under-
stand it so little as to think some other fellow must have written it, you may
be quite certain it is an allegory. When you print it, jour publio reads into
it all kinds of mysterious and morbid religious emotions, and confused misin-

Tact' Sankir was stewing kraut in the old Dutoh saucepan. The
scorching rays of the African snn were beating down upon Bowaparte
Bi.kn kinh who was doing his best to be son-like by beating Waldo.
Bis nose was red and disa-
greeable. He was something
like Hucklebebry Finn's
Dauphin, an amusing, cal-
lous, cruel rogue, but less
resourceful. Taut' Sahhte
laughed; it was so pleasant
to see a German boy beaten
black and blue. But the
Hottentot servants merely
gaped. It was their custom.
But in the middle distance
Life was playing marbles
with the Unknown. And
the Unknown said unto Life,
"Give me an alley-tor."
But Life replied, "Nay, for
the commoneys are lying
well, and the thumb of him
that aimeth is seasoned unto
the stroke." And the Un-
known beat his cable wings
together, and one blaok fea-
ther flitted far into the breast
of the day and fell to earth.
And there came a fair-haired
Child plucking flowers in
the desert with brows bent
in thought.
And Life said unto the
Child, "Play with me."
And the Unknown said, "Play with me."
But the Child raised its soft hand slowly end the tender fingers
grew apart, and its thumb was poised in thought upon its nose, and
it spake not at all. And the feather flitted far, far over the waste,
and men came forth and gazed upon it, but it heeded them not.
Then said Life, "I am strong. Kings have need of me and earth
is my dominion." But the Unknown gathered up the scattered
marbles, oonoealing them gently, and answered only this—" 1 am a
greater than Life."
And the Child strayed onwards and the feather flitted, and Tact'
Sannib still stewed kraut in the old Dutch saucepan. And
Bonaparte BlixKiss was glad.
Chapter II.
Cruelty, cruelty, oruelty—all' is 'cruelty 1 Boys are beaten;
oxen are stabbed till the blood bursts forth; happy, industrious,
dung-collecting beetles are bitten in two by careless, happy, beetle-
collecting dogs—everything is wicked and cruel. The Kaffir has
beautiful legs, but he will kick his wife, and Taxt' Sahnis, alas I
will not be there to drop a pickle-tub on his head. And over every-
thing hangs that inscrutable charm which hovers for ever for toe
human intellect over the incomprehensible and shadowy. Omne
ignotum pro miriflco, I might say, but I prefer the longer phrase.
And I stood at the gate of Heaven, I and Tact* Saxnie; and we
spoke to everybody quite affably; and they all had time to listen to
what we said, and to make suitable replies.
And I said, "Are we all here P"
And she said, "Not all."
And I said, "The absent are always in the wrong."
And she said, "I have heard that in French."
And I said, "Is not that impertinent?"
And sVe said, "No."
And a great Light fell across her faoe. as though a palm had
smitten it, and the name of the palm was Hand, and its fruits were
fingers five.
And again I addressed myself in terms of familiarity to the Ever-
lasting, and I planted a book upon the olouds, where eight children
lay prone with bees flying about their ohildish bonnets.
And there came a knock at my door.
"Eight o'olook!" said One. "Arise 1"
"Nay," I answered; "it cannot be."
"But the water is hot within the can, and the table will be spread
for them that break their fast."
"So he it. I rise." And behold it was a dream!
Chatter III.
Far away the mother of the little nigger stood ohurning. Where
is the mother of the little black nigger t She is ohurning slowly in
the garden. But cannot the aunt of the good gardener churn herself?
No; for she is in the orchard, plucking the apples, peaches, apricots,
pears (Birnen), to give to the butler's grandmother.
And there came Life and The Ideal walking hand in hand. And
behind them came Wealth and Vastness singing together. And
Infinity was there, and Health, and Wisdom, and Love. And Reflec-
! tion was mounted on a steed with Joy. And many other shapes
followed, delicately arrayed
in fine linen. And helmet-
wearing Men in Blue mar-
shalled the procession. And
they spake roughly, saying,
"Pass away there, pass away
there!"
And I said, "Ib this the
Lord Mayor's Show?"
And One said. "No."
And I said, "Is it the Sal-
vation Army?"
And again One said," No."
And I said, "Is it Se-
quah?"
And One said again, "No."
And I said. "I have
guessed enough."
And One said, "Yes."
But The Real was not
there, and they passed away.
And One said, "I am
Wealth," which was absurd,
but No-one laughed. And
they all danced a fandango
on the points of their toes.
And a shaft of light lay
over them. And they wan-
dered on. At last they came
to a bad, wicked naughty,
brimstone place. And I
said to Some-one, "I like this. It seems a good place." And still No-
one laughed. And Wealth touched me, and I was glad. And I
said, "Give me millions, or buy a box of matches," and Law
seized me and took me to the Cell. Then I said to the Beak, "Tour
Worship." And the Beak said unto me, "Begging again. Forty
shillings." And again I woke. And it was all a striving and a
striving and an ending in Nothing.

TO MLLE. JANE MAY.

From Cupid's own pinion, 'tis doubtfulliah whether

Might both be struck mute by the Muse of Dumb-Show.

OPERATIC NOTES.

Monday, May 4.—Zklik de Lussan's Carmen is about the best
when all the other dear charmers are away, and in the character she
will probably remain in possession of the field, or, rather, "the
Garden," till the end of the season. The remainder as before, with
Dsvoyod as Etcamillo. But what has be-
come of the " go " in the TorSador't great
song? Where are the double encore* t
Where, indeed, the hearty applause?
Surely it has gone the way of the March
1 \ in Faust, onoe so enthusiastically received
\ and cheered to the echo; and now—" March
rS| off 1" It is true that, onoe let a "tuney
1 tune" become vulgarised by street-musi-
cians, and organic disease would be suffi-
cient to kill it were it not tortured and
ground to death by remorseless hands. But
the Toreador's song and the March have
not been the victims of an organised oppo-
sition. Perhaps, though, they may have been, only 'tis so long ago
as not to be within the ken of the present deponent. Anyhow,
the Toreador's song goes for nothing nowadays, and yet 'tis as good
as ever.
Thurtday.—We weloomed The Don. Not the Aoademio Don onoe
so popularly represented by Mr. J. L. Toole, but Mozabt's
Italianised Spanish Don. A propos of Mr. Toolb, it has always
been the wonder of his friends, to whom the quality of his vocal
powers is so well known, that he has never been tempted to renounce
the simple histrionio for the lyric Drama. It is said, and " greatly
to his credit," that, had it not been for his unwillingness to rob his
friend Sims Reeves of the laurel-crown he wears as first English
Tenor of his age, he would long ago have set up a most dangerous
opposition to that sweet singer, and have ridden off victoriously
with " My Pretty Jane" seated up behind him, pillion-wise, on the
noble steed known as " The Bay of Biscay O!
But the above is an entr'acte, shorter than those at Covent Garden,
by the way. M. Matjhel first-rate as the Don, both in acting and
singing, even better in former than latter; but the dear old serenade,
whioh never can be vulgarised, in spite of its popularity, was encored,
and the encore was gracefully accepted, Signor Bevignani being in
the chair, and willing to tap the desk and announce, "Gentlemen!
Monsieur M aukfx will oblige again!" Applause.
If all the village maidens could dress in a costume suoh as Miss
/ £xie-Zeklina wears, then, to take the best and nicest view of it.
that village must be uncommonly prosperous. Probably tourists'
visits are not few and far between: but anyhow, even the most un-
suspicious bumpkin of a lover, would be inclined to ask a few ques-
tions about this finery. However, her performance was as fine as

the dress, and she looked quite the Zelib-Zerlina, so fascinating to
the Lord and the Lout.
Saturday.—Rome"o et Juliette, that is, M. Jean sx Rbczke and
Mile. Eaves. A nearly perfect performance. J ban a trifle too stout
for an ideal Romeo, but of course he couldn't go into training for the
part at short notice. The spirit with which he played the part far
outweighed the error of the flesh. Miss Eaxbs a charming Juliet in
every way, though her singing of the waltz was not of dazzling fire-
work brillianoy. Brother Ned was the Frere Laurent. Excellent.
The name Anglo-Frenohified, suggests a reverend gentleman who
would meddle with legal marriages and perform private ceremonies
without leave or licence from his Ordinary, and might be known as
Brother Law-wrong, an Extra-Ordinary Friar. The House crammed
full with an audience as brilliant as the performance.
THE LAST SONG.
[Mr. Sims Rbbvxs was announced to sing " Total Eclipse
Concert on Monday.]
Farewell! A most unwelcome word to all
Whom fifty years of charm have held in thrall:
Total eclipse—of pleasure on their part
Who love pure melody and polished Art.
Memory will echo long the silvery ohime
Of such a voice as even ruthless Time
Might stay his stride to listen to, and spare
From the corroding touch. Some scarce will care
To hear " Tom Boating" sung by other lips,
And when in tenor strains " Total Eclipse"
Sounds next upon our ears, Sims Reeves will
To sing again to us as in a pleasant dream.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Houtt of Common*, Monday, May 4.—Windbag Sexton had fine
opportunity to-night; made the most of it. Seymour Kkay absent
through greater part of sitting. Various rumours current in explana-
tion of the happy acoident. Influenza hinted
at; but Grand Young Gabdneb, who is
familiar with both, says Grippe much too
knowing to link itself with Member for
Elgin and Nairn. Towards Eleven o'clock,
rumour set at rest by appearance of K ea y.
Simple explanation of temporary absence is,
that he has been at home, drawing up a few
more Amendments.
In his absence, Windbag had it all to
himself. How many speeches he has made
through the dreary sitting am afraid to
reckon up. Members going off to write let-
ters, smoke a cigar, read evening papers, or
dine, leave him on his legs, with one hand
in pocket, and smile of serene satisfaction on
face, prosing on. Coming back, they find
him still in same position, apparently saying
same thing. Has lattly developed new ora-
torical oharm. Constantly repeats his sen-
tences, word for word. Everybody cleared
out, even Mr. G., and John M ok ley. Only
Prince Abthtjb left languorous on Treasury
Benoh.
"Drooping like a lily out of water,"
McEwan says. Not that he's given to tropes
of the kind; but, being lately at a wedding
feast smothered in flowers, some of them have
got into his conversation.
Btuineis done. — In Committee on Irish Land Bill, but no forrader.
Tuesday.—" Do you think I ought to wear spurs, Toby f"
It was Old Mobalitt who spoke. We were in his room at House;
j abt torn ourselves away from Committee on Irish Land Bill, where,
at the moment, oddly enough Sexton chanced to be speaking. Old
Mobalitt has been made Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, and is
trying on his uniform. Rather piratioal arrangement; blue cloth
coat with large
brass buttons,
red sash
round his
waist, with
holster thrust
in it, con-
taining the
horse - pistol

himself when

ing in a flat-

with broad
braid of gold
ace on outer
seams. Finally
there is a
t ruoule nt
cooked hat,
whioh Old
Mobalitt
persists in
putting on
with the peak «. H. Smith in his new character as Warden of the Cinque
astarn. The r°r,s »nd Constable of Dover Cattle,
dress is picturesque, and Old Morality's figure lends itself to itwith
peouliar grace and fitness.
"I fancy .Wellimoton wore spurs," the Lord Warden persisted.
Yes, I j oint out; but Pni didn't, nor did Pa lm kkston. Anyhow

just as well not to begin with spurs. Might in time grow up to them,
as it were.
Wanted the Lord Warden to enter House in his uniform: sadly in
need of sensation. One would certainly be provided if Old Mobalitt
were discovered sitting on Treasury Bench in his present costume.
"No," he said, "they would think I was going to move or second
the Address. Should like to get used to the clothes a little before
appearing in them in public places."
So go back to House myself, leaving the Lord Warden marching
up and down, making believe he is on the ramparts at Walmer.
Oddly enough, when I arrive Windbag Sexton making a speech, the
few Members present talking about Old Morality's promotion. A
dangerous epoch in a man's life. People apt just then to disoover all
kinds of shortcomings, and reasons why the promotion should have
fallen elsewhere. But no one grudges Old Mobalitt this high and
ancient honour: afresh chapter in the pleasant story of "Mr. Smith,"
a new " Part of His Life." For five years he has sat on the Treasury
Bench in succession to Disraeli and (.Gladstone; now he will
answer for the safety of the Cinque Ports in succession to Pitt and
Wellington, Dalhousie and Palmebston. Business done.—Old
Mobalitt made Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports.
Thursday.—" Tat Pat also among the Gentlemen of England 1"
exclaimed Sags of Queen Anne's Gate, for once almost moved out
of his customary self-possession. It certainly seems so. Came
about on Second Reading of London Tramways Bill; promoters
want to bring tramway over Westminster Bridge, and along Embank-
ment. Demos desires to go about his business on the tramway, and
does not see why he should be arbitrarily Btopped before he has
accomplished his journey. Carriage folk say. No; let Demos and
his penny tram stop at other side of the water, [leaving the broad
thoroughfare of the Embankment for what Radcliffe Cooke called
"the gilded chariot."
Debate gone forward for some time. No one expected to find
Tat Pat in this Galley. Since his return from Ameriky hasn't
opened his voice in debate: spoken in public only once. That
was to his constituents in Scotland Road, Liverpool; announced with
portentous blast in advance that then and there the anxious world
should learn what side he took in the leadership controversy. Others
had declared themselves, whether for Brer Fox or Brer Rabbit. The
momentous issue of Tat Pat's decision required further deliberation.
So all the world had to wait till Tat Pat
came home and saw his constituents.
Result not altogether satisfactory. As
Tim Healy put it, "Tat Pay showed
disposition to hunt with Brer Fox and run
with Brer Rabbit." If in the end Brer
Fox won, nothing in Tay Pay's Scotland
Road speech need prevent him returning
to his allegiance. If Brer Fox remained
nnder a cloud, he could jog along with
Brer Rabbit. Been careful not to spoil
the little game by taking part in debate in
House.
Now, on this London Tramways Bill,
which touches neither Brer Fox nor Brer
Rabbit, Tay Pay interposes. Conserva-
tives snort impatiently when he rises; cry
aloud for division; take it [for granted
that Tay Pay will back upDEMOs's demand
for equal right of way. But Tay Pay has
genuine'little surprise in store; is loftily
contemptuous of tramways, doncha. If
they cross the bridge and approach the
precincts of the West End. what is to
become of carriage-folk P "A noisy and
inconvenient system of locomotion," said
Tay Pay, shuddering with disgust, as
though he heard a coarse voice crying
"Fares, please 1"
House roared with laughter; Raijcliffb
Cooke talked about opposition " coming from Members who hoped to
ride in gilded coaches ;Cbemeb rudely reminded Tay Pay that ten
or fifteen years ago, he would have taken a very different view of the
convenience of tramway cars. This wasn't pleasant; but when the
Division bell rang, Tay Pay had the satisfaction of walking, alone
amongst his Party, with the Gentlemen of England, triumph an tlyivin
dioating the rights of carriage-folk against tramway trabs. Long time
since House of Commons witnessed a scene so rich as this in material
for reflection. Business don*.—Tay Pay declares against trams.
Friday.—Attendance on House gradually diminishing; what with
influenza, and Irish Land Bill in Committee, Members gradually
thinning off. No M.P. complete without his influenza. Barks shall
not be out of anything if its humble, but conscientious Men

LEAVES FROM A CANDIDATE'S DIARY.
[COHTIMUID.]
Wedne$day, April 30th, "George Hotel," Billsbury. —Spent
yesterday and the day before in chambers at the Temple. No work
as usual. Think I shall give it all up, and take entirely to politics.
Yesterday afternoon a Mr. Richabdson Groobam called on me by
appointment. He
had written me a
Ion; letter stating
that he had im-
portant informa-
tion to communi-
cate to me with
reference to my
candidature at
Billsbury, and de-
sired a short in-
terview in order to
lay it before
T >.■ , o l ~ Said he was
Looking for a Scat. Billsbury man born
and bred, and naturally interested in everything that concerned
the welfare of the old place, though for family reasons he had
found it best to make the home of his riper manhood in the
Metropolis." I smelt a rat, but thought it best to give him an
interview. He is a tall man, with a dark beard, straight dark
hair, a sallow face and shifty eyes, and was dressed rather
like a dissenting clergyman. He was immensely genial in his
manner, said he had read every word of my eloquent speeches,
and thoroughly agreed with all I had said, though he himself would
never have been able to say it half as well. He then asked me
if I had heard of his "History of the Borough of Billsbury"
in four volumes. I asked him who had published it and when, but
he said he had been made the victim of intrigues, and had not yet
secured a publisher, though there was any amount of money to be
made out of the book. Would I like to read it in MS., and give him
my candid opinion of it Y Exoused myself on the ground of great
pressure of work. He talked like this for about twenty minutes, and
at last came to what he called the chief purport of his visit. He said
he had in the course of his investigations, been fortunate enough to
acquire important and exclusive knowledge with regard to the early
life of Sir Thomas Chubson and his chief supporters in Billsbury.
"If it is published," he continued, "it will absolutely blast the
prospects of Radicalism in Billsbury. I am not a grasping man, but
I must consider my family. Still, Sir, such is my respect and liking
for you, that I am willing to place a sealed paoket containing all
these stories in your hands on payment of £150 down." I told
that wasn't my way either of fighting a constituency or of doing
business, whereupon he became more voluble than ever, and I had no
end of a job to get rid of the oily beast J erbam tells me to-day that
he was once a solicitor's clerk in Billsbury, and had to leave on
account of some missing money. Since then he appears to have lived
a shady life, varied by attempts at blackmail. Faugh!
Came down to Billsbury to-day, to attend the inaugural dinner of
the season of the Billsbury Cricket Club. I am a Vice-President,
and so is Chubson. The dinner was held in the large room of the
"Blue Posts Hotel." General Bannatynb, an old Indian, who is
the President of the Club, was in the chair, having Chubson on his
right, and me on his left. Old Chubson, to whom I was intro-
duced, seems not half a bad old fellow, but he can't speak a bit.
The dinner was awful, everything as tough as leather, and the
Cabinet Padding more beastly than any Cabinet Padding I ever
tasted—which is saying a good deal. Chubson proposed, "Pros-
perity to the Billsbury C. C." Politics," he said, *' are like Cricket.
We spend our time in bowling overs." At this point a young Con-
servative, who had drunk too muoh, shouted, "Ah, and you mostly
change sides, too "—an allusion to the fact that Chubson is believed
to have started in politics as a Tory. Somebody removed the inter-
rupter, and Chubson finished his speech all right, but the incident
must have annoyed him. I proposed "The Town and Trade of
Billsbury," and started by saying what pleasure it gave anybody
occupied in politics to take a part in a non-political celebration
like this. "My friend, Sir Thomas Chubson," I said, " and I have
not met before, and I congratulate myself, therefore, on having been
introduced to him to-day. We shall do our level best to bowl one
another out, but I know we shall play the game according to the
rules, and in that spirit of fair-play for which Englishmen in
general, and Billsbury cricketers in particular, are celebrated."
This was rather mixed, but it went very well. I think I took the
shine out of Chubson. Later on there was a shocking row between
two of the town-councillors, who got to loggerheads over the question
of the Billsbury Waterworks. It was smoothed over, however, after
everybody had shouted " No political" for about ten minutes.
Tolland says we must begin to canvas a little soon. Horrible
work, but absolutely
BOWLS.
(By a Buffer.
"Unfortunately (at bowls) one had to stoop to conquer: it is that stooping
which (except in politics) plays the deuce with us after fifty."
Jama Fnyn's Pita for Botch.
Yes, Patn, you are right—as you commonly are—
The vertebrae creak and. the ribs seem to jar,
When a man bends his back—after fifty—
If only to pull off his boots; he at length
Finds that curve in his spine is a strain on the strength
Of whioh middle-age must be thrifty.
But Bowls 1 Yes, my boy, it's a jolly old game,
Though athletio fanatics might vote it too tame,
But sense is not baffled by bogies.
The Emerald Green and the " bowls" and the "jack,"
Are beautiful—but for that bend in the back—
To those the young furies call "fogies."
You have not to " sprint" o'er some aores of grass,
To " slog" or to scamper, to " scrummage" or "pass,"
At the risk of your ribs, or "rheumatics";
You have not to treat your opponents like foes,
Or "go for" your rival's shin-bone or his nose,
As do the aforesaid fanatics.
But how pleasant the " green" in the cool of the day,
The tankard of stingo, the yard of white day,
And the play and the chaff of good fellows I
Although not a betting man howls outlthe odds,
And no ring of mad backers—like gallery "gods"—
About us insensately bellows.
Yes, Patn, the " crank in," and the "kiss of the Jaok,"
All— save, as you say, that darned bend in the back—
About the old game is delightful.
We thank you for " trolling the bowl" once again,
Ah 1 it were a pleasure to play it with Patn—
(By Jove, though—that loin-twinge was frightful 1)
A THEATRICAL PLUNGE; OR, TAKING A HEDDA.
A plunge indeed! but fortunately the swimmers are strong,
and able to save the suicidal Ibsenites. For my part,—that it,
as one of the audience drawn by curiosity,—I should say that were
it not for the excellent acting of all concerned
in the piece, and especially of Miss Eliza-
beth Robins as the Hanwellian heroine,
Ibsen's Hedda Gabler would scarcely have
been allowed a second night's existence at
the Vaudeville. Miss Robins is so muoh
in earnest—as a true artist should be—that
she excites your curiosity to discover what
on earth she is taking all this trouble about;
and thus she compels your attention. That
the result is eminently unsatisfactory is no
fault of hers. The pieoe itself is stuff and
nonsense; poor stuff and "pernicious non-
sense." It is as if the author had studied
the weakest of the Robertsonian Comedies, and had thought he could
do something like it in a tragio vein.
In the last Aot there is a situation reminding us strongly of one
short scene in Ccute; there—so delicately and touohingly treated by
its author: here—so repulsively treated by Ibsen. Let it be reduced
to serious burlesque, and let us have it played by Penley as George
Tetman, Abthuk Roberts (with a song) as Judge Brack, Weedon
GB0S8MITH as Ej'lbert Zooborg, Miss Lottie Venne as Mrt. Hedda
Tetman, Mrs. John Wood as Aunt Juliana, and Miss Jessie Bond
(with song and dance) as Mrs. Elvtted. It is announced in the bill
as " I usen's Last Play." There's a crumb of comfort in this.

A Powerful Cast.
QUEER QUERIES.
Oatmeal Pohrtdoe.—Would some Sootoh housewife kindly en-
lighten me as to the proper mode of preparing the above delioaoy?
I fancy there must be some mistake about the method I have hitherto
adopted. Is it really necessary to " boil for forty-eight hours, and
then mix with equal quantities of gin, Guinness's Stout, Gum
Arabic, and Epsom Salts 1"' I have followed this recipe (given me
by a young friend, who says he has often been in Scotland) faith-
fully, but the result is not wholly satisfactory. I doubt whether
genuine porridge should be of the consistency of a brick-bat, or
taste of hair-oilT—Undaurted.

"With bited breath and whispering humble-

Not so! There comes a season when the stress
Of insolent and exacting tyranny
Makes the most patient turn.
Autocracy,
Without the despot's vaunted virtue, pride,
Shows small indeed. Can Power lay aside
Its swaggering port, and low petition mike
(Driven by those Treasury thirsts which never
For help from those^it harries P Pharaoh's
scourge
Was the taskmaster's weapon, used to urge
The Ilebrew bondsmen to their tale of toil,
Bat they round whom the Russian's knout
thongs coil,
Are of the breed of those the Russian palm
Can make petition to. Could triumph balm
The wounds of ages, here were balm indeed;
But blood revolts.
Race of theohangeless creed,
And ever-shifting sojourn, Shakspeare's
type
Deep meaning hides, which, when the world
is ripe
For wider wisdom, when the palsying curse
Of prejudice, the canker of the purse,
And blind blood-hatred, shall a little lift,
Will olearlier shine, like sunburst through a
rift
In congregated cloud-wracks. Shylock stands
Badged with black shame in all the baser
lands.
Use him, and—spit on him! That's Gentile
wont;
Make him gold-conduit, and befoul thefont,—
That's the true despot-plan through all the
diys.
And cackling Gralianot chorus praise.
"The Jew shall have ail justice." Shall
he so?
The tyrant drains, his gold, then bids
him—" Go 1"
Shylock? The name bears insult in its
sound;
Bat he was nobler than the curs who hound
The patient Hebrew from his home, and
drive
Deathward the stronger souls they dread
alive.
Shylock t So brand him, boors and babbling
wags,
Who scorn him, yet would share his money-bags;
Who hate him, yet can stoop to suoh appeal!
Beneath his meekness there s a soul of steel.
High-featured, amply-bearded, see he stands
Facing the Autocrat; those sinewy hands,
Shaped but for clutching—so his slanderers
say—
The huckster bait can coldly put away
"Blood against bullion." The Jew-baiting
band
Howl frantic execration o'er the land;
Malign and menace, pillage, persecute;
Though the heart's hot, the mouth must fain
be mute.
The edict fulminates, the goad pursues;
Proscription, deprivation,—ay, they use
All the old tortures, nor are then content,
But crown the work with ruthless banish-
ment.
And then—then the proud Muscovite seeks
grace,
And gold, from kinsmen of the harried raee!
"He would have moneys" from the Hebrew
hoard,
To swell his state, or whet his warlike sword!
Perchance buy heavier scourges for the baoks
Of lesser Hebrews, whom hu wolfish packs
Of salaried minions hunt.
Take baok thine hand,
Imperious Autocrat, and understand
Gold buys not, rules not, serves not, salves
not all.
Blood speaks—in favour of the helpless thrall
Of tyranny. Here's no tame Shylock: he
Shall not bend low, and in a bondsman's key,
Make o'er his money-bags with unctuous grace
To an enthroned enslaver of his race.
"Well then, it now appears you need n>v
help" [yelp!)
(You - whose trained ours at my poor kinsmen
"What should I say to you? Should I not
say,
"Hath a dog money?" Blood's response
is-" Nay 1"
A somewhat curious association of names
and ideas occurs in last week's Sporting and
Dramatic, where there is an illustration of
some ceremony taking plaoe which is described
as " The Rains's Foundation May Day Cele-
bration." Odd, that this particular Raike
should always fail on the First of May.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The Diary of a Pilgrimage occupies 175 pages of one of Abrow-
smith's three-and-sixpenny books, and no doubt the admirers of
its author, Mr. Jehomk K. Jerome, may possibly not grudge this
amount when gauging its value by its attractive cover. It is
"'Abbt Abroad," that's all. 'Akey Abroad laughs and talks
loudly in foreign churches, sneers and jeers at everything he does
not understand—and this includes the greater portion of all he sees
and hears—chaffs puzzled officials, and everywhere makes himself
highly and exceptionally popular. In this Diary 'Abbt is occa-
sionally rather amusing when he is endeavouring to be either
serious or sentimental, or both. 'Abbt serious or 'Abbt sentimental,
or 'Abbt sentimentally serious and expecting to be taken at his own
valuation, is of course delightful, only a little of it goes a great way,
and this Cockney pilgrim goes too far, especially when giving us his
valuable opinion on the Passion Play. 'Abbt on the Passion Play,
and the character of Judas Iscabiot 1 As Hedda Qabler't husband
observes on every possible opportunity—" Fanoy that!" Only onoa
the Baron finds himself in agreement with the travelling 'Abbt,
and this happens when he says, "I must candidly confess that the
English-speaking people one meets with on the Continent are,
taken as a whole, a most disagreeable contingent." Yes, certainly,
when they are all 'Arries. Set an 'Abbt to catch an 'Abbt, and of
course to the regular right-down 'Altar all other 'Abbibs, not
'appnin' to 'ave the Aonour of being 'is own parties, are detestably
vulgar cads. The remainder of the book, i.e., 131 pages, is padded
with essays, a fact not mentioned on the outside of the work, whioh,
like chanty, covers a multitude of sins. Whether this is quite a
fair way of stating contents, is a question which the lUron supposes
both Publishers and Author have thoroughly considered.
Don't skip Ellen Tkbbt's Memoirs in The New Review. Nothing
much in them, but delightfully chatty and amusing. See Murray's
Magazine for Mr. Gladstone on the Murray Memoirs, in the
number for the " Murray Month of May." When you are routing
ab >ut for something short and amusing, take up the Cornhill, and
read A F>ath in the Pan. I have commenced, says the Baron,
my friend Geobgb Meredith's One of the Conquerore, Now G. M.
is an author whose work does not admit of the healthy and graceful
exercise of skipping. Here the skipper's occupation is gone. G. M.'s
work should be taken away by the reader far from the madding
crowd and perused and pondered over. If Ponder's End is a tran-
quil place as the name implies, then to that secluded spot betake
yourself with your George Meredith, 0 happy [and studious
reader, and ponder in peace.
Since the time of Richard Feverel, whioh I shall always consider
his best, "of the very best" as Zero of the Monte Carlo Bar has it,
G. M. has developed into a gold-beater of epigrams. What once
served him as a two-line epigram, is now spread out over a couple of
pages. Two volumes instead of three would serve his turn far better,
or rather the public's turn, for his own is a very peculiar one. Bat to
my task, says the Baron, give me a slight refresher and a suck at the
lemon as it were, or a sip of the lemonade, and at him again.

ROBERT ON ENGLISH AND FOREIGN WAITERS.
Well, things is cumming to a pretty pass, things is, when I'm
aoahally told that, as it used to be said formerly, "No Hirish need
apply for nothing," so now, we are told, that no English Waiters
need apply at the Royal Nawal Xhibishun unless he bes a German 1

"Rule, Britannia, Britannia rules the Waves!
For Britons never, never, NEVER
Shall be Slaves I"
Robert the Waiter. "What's this I 'No Evoi.ish heed applt I
Gkkmans only taken'! This is 'Britons never shall be
Slaves' with a wenoeance 1"
I never knowed as Jack Tars, and Powder-Munkyr, and Admerals
(as is so fond of Port, that they takes the werry name), was so werry
parshal to Germans, that they woud sooner go without their dinners
and tease, than be waited on by any other gennelmen, most suttenly
not. "O contrare," as the French Waiters says. It 'ud be a jolly
long time^I shood think, before your real British Sailers wood learn
to call a Waiter a Oauon, tho' as it means, I'm told, a Boy, there
is sum little sense in it, ooz there's, in course. Old Boys as well as
Fang ones; but what on airth meaning is there in a Eelner! as
'm acshally told all German Waiters insists on being called 1 Why
the thing's too absurd to tork about.
Besides the British Pabliok is used to our little ways, as we are
quite used to theim, and they talk to us in that nice oonndenshal tone
about the different wines, et setterer, as no true Bom Englishman
ewer yet spoke to a Frenchman, muoh less a German. No, no, the
hole thing's a mistake, as will soon be found out. And what a grooe
injustice to the native article. These sollem-looking Germans, not
content with pushing our poor sons from their stools in our counting-
houses, as Macbeth says, must now cum and take the werry bread out
of their poor Father's mouths. Oh pale-faced shame, where's your
blush t And think too of their himperanoe. Why they are aoshilly
a going for to have a hexibition of their own, here in Lundon, and
does anyone think as they '11 write up on the gates, "Only English
Waiters need apply?" Why the hidear is ridiolouB, butlwhere's the
difference I should like to kno. No, no, no one can kno better than I
do, from a long and waried xperienoe, from the Grand old City, the
ome of ospitality and turtle soup, to the "Grand" and " Metropole,"
the omesof luoksury and refinement, that the British Publio likes his
British Waiter, he likes his nioe respeoful ways, the helligent Bow
with whioh he ands him his At, and the graoef u hair with whioh he
. reoeeves his little dooBure. Robert.

SPECIMENS FROM ME. PUNCH'S SCAMP-ALBUM.
No. IV.—The Husband's Old School-fellow.
We will suppoee tbat you are a young wife, and that your husbind
is absent in the City during the greater part of the day. One after-
noon a card is brought in Staring the inscription:—
Captain Cablkeb.
United Service Club. The Hermitage, Coventry,
which document is followed olosely by a tall, well-groomed, rather
portly and florid stranger, with a military mouttache, who greets
you with the utmost cordiality. "1
Happened to find myself in this neigh-
bourhood," he says, "and I could not
—I really could not—resist this oppor
tunity. My name, I venture to think, is
a sufficient introduction?"
It is nothing of the sort—
bnt you are too shy and too
polite to'admit it, so you
merely murmur some inco-
herenoy. He detects you
at once. "Ah!" he cries,
in good-tempered reproach;
"1 see, I've been too san-
Eine. Now confess, my dear lady, you
ven't a notion who I am!"
Thus brought to bay, you own that
you have no clue to your visitor's iden-
tity—as yet. "Well—well," he sayB,
tolerantly, "Time is a terrible sponge-
though I had hoped that, even after all
these years, your dear husband might
have occasionally mentioned the name of
his old school- chum! I've never for-
gotten Awn—no, all through the years
I've been in India I've never forgotten
dear old. Walter!"
"But my husband's name is William!"
you say here.
"He was always Walter to me,
Madam, or rather—Watty. He was so
like a favourite young brother of mine,
who died young. That drew us together from the first,
old Watty never tell you how he saved my life once?
So like him!—he wouldn't. But he did, though; lyes, by Gad,
jumped into fifteen foot of water after me, and kept me up when I
was going under for the last time. Pardon me, but 1 see a photograph
upon your writing-table—surely, unless I am wrong, that
"That is a portrait of my only brother," you will say; "he is
out in India with his regiment—perhaps you may have met him
there?"
"Thought I knew the face—met him at Simla, several times,"

Did dear
No?
says the Captain; "wonderful how small the world is! But have
you one of old Watty's photos? I should so like to see whether
the dear old ehap has altered ... Ah, I should hardly have known
him- and yet, yes, the came cheery, jolly look, I can trace the
boy there, I can see my old Watty again! No friends, my dear
Mrs. Gosling, like those we make in early youth! And he never
mentions me now? Ah! well, he has a very charming excuse for
forgetting the vast—though I shall tell him when I see him that I
do think he might have remembered his old school-friend a little
better than he seems to have done. Your servant informed me that
he was seldom at home quite so early as this, but I thought if I
could not see him, I would at least give myself the pleasure of
making the acquaintance of his wife, so I just ventured to come in
for five minutes."
"William will be so disappointed to have missed you," you say,
eagerly; "can't you wait and let me give you some tea? He may
be back in half an hour."
"In half an hour? Well, 'pon my word, you tempt me very
much. I shouldn't like to go away without seeing him, but I must
send away my cab first—no, it's not outside, left it at the corner of
the road, as I wasn't certain of the number—I s'pose I've got
enough silver to—no, I haven't, by Jove! Could you oblige me by
change for a—well, really, this is very awkward. I've positively
come out with only a shilling—thought it was a sovereign I I shall
have to ask dear old Watty to accommodate me—I've lent him many
a half-crown in the old days. Absurd predicament to be in, and if
I keep my cabman waiting, I don't know what he mayn't charge
me. I took him three hours ago. I tell you what, my dear Mrs.
Gosling; If you '11 advance me a sovereign, I could run out and
settle with the fellow, and then it won't signify hou> long I wait for
Watty. Can you? Too good of you, I'm sure! Watty will
chaff me when he hears I've been borrowing like this, ha, ha!"
Here your ear, sharpened by affection, catches a well-known turn
of the latch-key at your front-door. Why, how fortunate!" you
exclaim, "here is my husband already, Captain Caulk eh. He will
come in as soon as he has changed his shoes."
"Capital!" cries the Captain. "Look here, Mrs. Gosling,—I've
just thought of a little joke. I want to see if he '11 know me. Now
you go and talk to him a little, and—presently, you know—say
there's a man in the drawing-room, who s come to wind the clocks,
and then I '11 eome in to where you are, and make believe to wind
the clock there—do you see? I'd bet anything he won't spot me at
first!"
You are young enough to be delighted at the idea of such a pretty
little comedy, and you trip away to the study, and archly keep dear
William in conversation until the Captain is ready to make his
appearance. At last, a little impatiently, you give the cue by men-
tioning that there is a clock-winder in the drawing-room. William
is amusingly suspioious, and insists on seeing the man. As the
soene will be just as funny in the drawing-room, you accompany him
thither—but there is no gallant Captain there affecting to wind your
charming little Sevres dock (a wedding present) —he has gone, and—
alas! without leaving a timepiece for anybody else to wind. And
William is most disagreeable and unpleasant about it!

No/lV.-THE WILD DUCK.
Act I.
At Werle's house. In front a richly-upholstered study, (r.) a
green-baize door leading to Wbble's office. At back, open fold-
ing doors, revealing an elegant dining-room, in which a brilliant
Norwegian dinner-party is going on. Hired Waiters in profu-
sion. A glass is tapped with a knife. Shouts of "Bravo."'
Old Mr. Werle is heard making a long speech, proposing—
according to the custom of Norwegian society on such occasions—
the health of his Housekeeper. Mrs. Eobbt. Presently several
short-sighted, flabby, and thin-haired Chamberlains, enter from
the dining-room, with Hialmar Ekdal, who writhes shyly
under their remarks.
A Chamberlain. As we are the sole surviving specimens of Nor-
wegian nobility, suppose we sustain our reputation as aristooratio
sparklers by enlarging upon the enormous amount we have eaten,
and chaffing Hialmar Ekdal, the friend of our
host's son, for being a professional Photo-
grapher?
The other Chamberlains. Bravo I We will.

remember, was a servant in your family once.

preserve, you see. And my poor old father and I sometimes get a
day's gunning in the garret. He shoots with a pistol, which my
illiterate wife here will call a " pigstol." He onoe, when he got into
trouble, pointed it at himself. But the descendant of two lieutenant-
colonels who had never quailed before living rabbit yet, faltered
then. He didn't shoot. Then I put it to my own head. Bnt at the
decisive moment, I won the victory over myself. I remained in life.

happy and contented as I am. [He eats some bread and butter.

an agent of Police appeared upon the scene, and we had to
deoamp hurriedly. Duel postponed till to-morrow.
Tuesday.—New spot ohosen. Pistols this time instead of
rapiers. Just as we were about to fire, appearance of the
agents of the law. Postponement sgain absolutely necessary.
Wednesday.—Onoe more ready to meet. Both of us rather
amused at the precautions we have to take to prevent inter-
ruption. Opponent obligingly suggested a new and suitable
spot for the settlement of our little differences. Found it to be
a most excellent selection, but before we could fight, once
more interrupted. Both of us greatly annoyed, and arranged
to meet to-morrow.
Thursday.—Amused to find myself first in the field—my
opponent five minutes late. Both of us had come before the
seconds, and so spent the time in a pleasant little chat, and
cigarettes. My opponent not half a bad fellow when you come
to know him. Jast as he was in the middle of a most amusing

once more imperative.

Saturday,—Met again. Really quite pleased to have made
the acquaintance of suoh a nice fellow as my opponent. Full
of fun and anecdote. On comparing notes, we found that we
had entirely forgotten what on earth we had quarrelled about.
So shook hands and arranged that if we fired at anyone, our
target should be the Police.

Histoby akd Art.—Doubts have been thrown on the
genuineness of the story about St. Elizabeth of Hungary as
illustrated by Mr. Caldebon's well-known and striking
picture in this year's Aoademy. Mr. C a id ebon affirm*,
according to the best of his high lights, that he has simply
portrayed the naked truth. So far, in a certain sense, the
Court is with him. Still, historians are neither unbiassed nor
infallible, and painters are inclined to sacrifice much for effect.
For our part, we should be inclined to refer the situation,
which this pioture illustrates, to some incident in the life of
the celebrated Miss Elizabeth Martin, generally known as
"Betty Mabtut." The legend may be found in some work
by that voluminous writer Finis, or by the oft-quoted Ibid,
— the quaint heading, Historia Mei et Beati Martini.

Fats, that makes sport alike of peasants and of kings, turning
the one to honour and a high seat,
and making the other to lie low
in the estimation of men, though
haply (as 'tis said in our parish)
he think no small beer of himself,
hath seemingly ordained that I,
Thomas Tiddler, should set down
in order some doings wherein I
had a share. And herein I make
no show of learning, being but an
undoetrined farmer and not skilled
in the tricks of style, as the word
is in these parts, but trusting
simply to strength and honesty
(whereof, God knows, there is but
little beyond the limits of our
farm), and to that breezy carriage
of the pen whioh f avoureth a plain
man treading sturdily the winding
paths and rough plaoesof hisnative
tongue. Notwithstanding I take
no small encouragement from this,
that whereas of those that have
made to my knowledge the bravest
boasting and the loudest puffing
(though of this I am loth to speak,
never having had a stomach for the
work), the writings often perish
neglectfully and nothing said,
some, writing afar in quiet places
removed from the busy rabblement
of towns, not seldom steer their
course to fame and riches, whereof,
thanks be to Heaven, I never yet
had covetousness, deeming theirs
the happier lot to whom a dry orust
with haply a slice of our good coun-
try cheese and a draught of the
foaming cider bring contentment.
Each to his own fashion, say I, and
the fashion of the Tiddlers hath
always been in a manner plain and
unvarnished, like to the large oak press wherein mother stores her
Sunday gown and other woman's finery such as the mind of man,
being at best but a coarse week-day creature, hath never fairly con-
ceived. But lo I I am tarrying on my way, losing myself in a maze
of cheap fancies, while the reader perchance .yawns and stretches
his limbs as though for bed. All I know is paper and ink are
cheaper than when I began to write.
Chutes II.
Now it fell on a Summer morning, I being then but newly come
home from the Farmers' College, in the ancient town of Cambridge,
that our whole household was gathered together in our parlour.
Mother sat by the head of the great table, ladling out a savoury mess
of porridge, not rashly, as the custom of some is, but carefully, like
a prudent housewife, guarding her own. And by her side sat Moi.ly
and Betty, her daughters, and next to them the maids, and they
that pertained to the work of the house. First came old Polly
Thistlf.dew, gaunt of face, and parched of skin, the wrinkles
running athwart her face, and over her hooked nose, like to the
rivers drawn with muoh labour of meandering pen in the school-
boys' maps, though for such my marks were always low, I being
better skilled in the giving of raps with the closed fist than in the
making of maps with inky fingers—a bootless toil, as it always

hath seemed to me. Next to her sat Sally, the little milkmaid,
casting coy glances at mother, who would have none of them, but
with undue sternness, as I thought then, and still think, tossed them
back to the shame-faoed Sally. Lower down sat JoHit Tooxxs,
"Girt Jan Doublefacr " he was ever called, not without a sly hint
of increasing obesity, for John, though a mighty man of thews
and sinews, was no small trencherman, and, as the phrase is, did
himself right royally whenever porridge was in question. All these
sat, peaceably swallowing, while I, at the table's foot, faced mother,
stirring my'steaming bowl with my forefinger, forgetting the heat
thereof, but not daring to wince, lest Betty, whose tongue out
shrewdly when she had a mind, should make sport of me.
Chapter III.
Although I had, for the most part, so very stout an appetite that
my bowl stood always first for the refilling, I had no desire for my
food that day, but idly sat and stirred, and the burden of my
thoughts wore deeply inward with the dwelling of my mind on this
view and on that of it. But, on a sudden, what a turmoil, what a
rising of maids, what a jumping on chairs, what a drawing up of
gowns, and what a scurrying I For, out of a corner, comes the great
brown rat, gliding sedately, and
never so muoh as asking by your
leave or with your leave. Then
mother's old tom-cat, Trouncer,
slowly rising, stretches his limbs,
and bares his olaws, making ready
for what is to come, but not, me-
thinks, with much alacrity for the
conflict, for rats have teeth, as
Trouncer knows—ay, and can use
them to muoh purpose. Therefore
Trouncer, making belief to be
brave, as is the custom both of
oats and of others that walk on
two legs, and have thumb* to
their fore-paws, gathers himself
to the spring, but springs not.
Then comes Gist Jaw's terrier,
Router, at last—where hath the
terrier been tarrying P Terriers
should not tarry—and, with scant
ceremony, leaps upon Trouncer.
Cuff, ouff, go the olaws. Trouncer
swears roundly. Nay, Trouncer,
'tis a ooward's part to fly beneath
the chair. To him, good Router,
to him. my man. But Router
hath forgot the claw - bearer,
though his bleeding nose for many
a day shall remember. Router
hath the rat in view. Round the
parlour they go, helter-skelter,
Router on the tracks of the life-
desiring rat, while the maids upon
the chairs show ankles, in proof
of terror, until, lo! he hath him
pinned fast, never more to stir,
or clean his whiskers in rat-land.
And then all come down, and
Jan boasts loudly how he all but
trod him flat, ay, and could have
done so had rat not fled in terror
of his boot; and Trouncer returns, smugly purring, and mother
rates the blushing maids.
And I to the fields, having work to do, bat liking not the doing.
Chapter IV.
Now I with Router at my heels went manfully on m> way. Gaily
I went over the parched brown wastes where lately the flood had lain
heavy upon the land, past the whispering copses of fir and beech and
oak that top the upland, through the yellowing corn that stands
waving golden promise in the valley, till I oame to where the land
bends suddenly with a sharp'turn from the eastward whenoe a pearly
brook, now swollen to a roaring torrent, babbles bravely over the
stones. Sudden I stopped as though a palsy had gripped me, though of
the Tiddlers, as is well known, none hath ever suffered of a palsy,
they being for the most part a lusty race, and apt for enduring
moisture both within and without. Never till my dying day shall
I forget the sight that met my eyes. For there seated upon a tufiet,
her beautiful blue eyes fixed in horror and despair, her jug of curds
and whey scarce tasted, was my Marian, while beside her, lolling
at ease with the slothful stretch of his great limbs, and the flames
as of Tophet in his fierce eyes sat Spider, the great black-haired
giant Spiber that would make a feast of her.
I know not how I ran, nor what mighty strength was in my limbs,

but in a moment I was with them, and his hairy throat was in my
clutch. Quickly he turned upon me and fain had 'freed himself.
Our breast-bones cracked in the conflict, his arms wound round and
round me, and a hideous gleam of triumph was in his face. Thrice
he had me off my feet, but at the fourth close I swayed him to the
right, and then with one last heave I flung him on his back, and had
the end of it, leaving him dead and flattened where he lay.

Then gently I bore my Ma.hi.vn home, and mother greeted her
fondly, saying, "Miss Muffet, I presume?" which pleased me,
thinking it only right that mother should use ceremony with my
love. But she, poor darling, lay quiet and pale, scarce knowing her
own happiness or the issue of the light. For 'tis the way of women
ever to faint if the occasion serve and a man's arms be there to prop
them. And often in the warm summer-time, when the little lads and
lasses gather to the plucking of buttercups and daisies, likening
them gleefully to the gold and silver of a rich man's coffers, my
darling, now grown matronly, eitteth on the tuffet in their midst,

OUE BOOKING-OFFICE.
One of our " Co."—and the Baron may observe that, when " Co." is
written it is not an abbreviation of " Coves"—has been reading Sir
George (Bentley), a Novel, whioh Mrs. Hnmni has the courage
to put forth in one volume.
At the outset, the writing
is a little slipshod. Mrs.
Hennikek has, moreover,
a wild passion for the
conjunction. When she can't
summon another "whioh,"
she sticks in a " that." On
one page appears the follow-
ing startling announcement
— The March winds this
year were unusually biting,
and her nervous guardian
would therefore [why there-
fore?] never allow her to
walk out without a res-
pirator, till they blew no
longer from the East." We
assume that, as soon as respirators blew from the West, this injunc-
tion would be withdrawn. But, as Mrs. Hbnnikbr gets forward in
her story, the style improves, " whioh's" disappear as they did in
Macbeth's time, and the tale is told in simple strenuous language.
Uncle George is a character finely conceived, and admirably drawn.
The Baron returns thanks to the publisher, W. Heinemann, for
sending a volume of Dk Qcincey's Potthumoroue Works. A small
dose of them, taken occasionally the last thing at night, may be con-
fidently recommended to admirers of The Opium Eater, and will
probably be found of considerable value to some who hitherto may
have been the victims of insomnia. Highly recommended by the
Faculty. (Signed.) Baron dk Book-Works & Co.
EVENINGS FROM HOME.
At the Court Theatre, Le Feu Toupinel, adapted for the English
stage as The Late Lamented, is decidedly funny, that is, if you can
once get over the idea that all its humour depends upon _ the im-
moral vagaries of an elderly scoundrel, an habitual criminal, who
has departed this life in the odour of respectability, without his im-
moralities ever having been discovered. Had he been found out
during his lifetime, he would have been tried for bigamy, convicted,
and punished accordingly. This piece has been adapted from the
French for the English stage; but. query, is it adapted to an English
audience? That's the point. The run must decide. If the best
possible acting can carry it along, then that it has got; for, though
Mrs. John Wood has frequently had better chances, yet she has
never worked harder, and never has she more deserved the laughter
she excites. The same may be said of Mr. Standing and Miss
FuxiPPi, and also of Mr. Arthur Cecil, whose make-up is perfect,
especially the dressing and colouring of his hair, whioh is an artistio
triumph. Mr. Gilbert Farquhar's Mr. Fatecett, the Solicitor,
contributes muoh to the fun of the scenes in whioh he appears with
Mrs. John Wood; and Mr. Cape, as Parker, the Confidential Ser-
vant, is excellent. There's plenty of " go" in it, but will it" stay" P

Gentlemen, if you please, ".For—all our fancy, Dwells upon Nanoy!"
Our Ellen is charming in this, so natural and so theatrical: her-
self as Nance, and then as Mrs. Oldfield, the aotress, in the
characters that Nance assumes. For 'tis Ellen playing Nancy,
and Nancy again playing Tragedy and Comedy. It is an old
piece revived: there never was so old a piece, for there iw onlj itag
oharaoters in it, and they're all Old. There are two Oldjields and
two Oldworthys. Mr. Wenman as Oldfleld Senior, or the Old
Obadiah, is a trifle too blusterous, but on the other hand, I am not
prepared to say that a country attorney of that period wouldn t
be uncouth and blusterous. His son Alexander, the Young Obadiah,
is prettily played by Mr. Gordon Craig, who is a trifle too wina-
milly with his hands and arms; but in the whole play nothing
becomes him so well as the pathos of his broken-hearted exit lie
was touching and going. Henoeforth, this young actor may justly

her Anne-sister—is as bright and lively as need be, considering her
menial position, which is rather odd in her sister's house. Visit

When some years ago the Irvingesque version of it was produced,

He comes to a house in the wilds of Corsica; he is choke-
full of Parisian gossip, he has a lot to say of course, but he
never gets a chance, as Fabien tells him family stories one after the
other, as if he hadn't had such an opportunity or so good a listener for
ever so long. Then, when on the entrance of his mother Fabien
breaks off in the middle of one of his many anecdotes, whioh
evidently can't be told before ladies, the Parisian gent, who now sees
something like an opening for some light Boulevardian ohit-ohat,
is presented with a flat candlestick and bowed off to bed, without
being allowed a word to say for himself. All this is just the same
as ever: there have been no alterations nor repairs; the piece is as
curiously old-fashioned as are the exquisitely correct costumes; while
the Masked Ball at the Opera and the Duel in the snow are as erf ective
as ever, and the latter, ii anything, more so. They make a first-rate
fight of it, do Messrs. Irving dei Franchi and M. Terries de Chateau
Renaud, until the latter collapses, and " subsequent proceedings inter-
ested him no more." As long as the strong right arm of the Corsioan
Brother can draw a good and shining rapier, he will draw as good
and brilliant a house as he did on the first night of this revival.
Why ought this piece to go well in the first theatre in Ireland f
Why? because it s a great play for Doublin'. Exeunt omnes.

These is a singular directness of purpose

The advertiser not only wants change, but
he mentions the exact sum. It seems odd.
One often wants change for a sovereign, and
even oftener wants the sovereign itself. But
what precise coin a man hands you when he
wants thirty-five shillings change is not quite

LEAVES FROM A CANDIDATE'S DIAEY.
Billtbury, May 5.—Received the following letter from Tolland
yesterday:—
D*ab Ma. Paitlk, Main Street, BHUbmy, May 3.
A Committee Meeting of our Council has been summoned
for the day after to-morrow (May 5) at eight o'clock p.m.. at the
Beaeonsfield Club, to consider some important questions alfecting
your Candidature and the plan of campaign to be adopted in prose-
cuting it. I trust that you may be able to make it convenient to
attend, and shall be glad to receive a wire from you to this effect.
I may mention to yon that I have lately heard, in confidence, that
Sir Thomas Chtjbson's health is causing considerable anxiety to the
Radical leaders here. He has attended very few divisions lately,
and has offended many of the advanced section by his conduct over
the Strike Subvention Bill, which was backed by the Labour Mem-
bers. Sir Thomas, however, abstained from the division on the
Second Reading. It is just possible that, under the circumstances,
he may decide to apply for the Chiltern Hundreds very shortly, and
we must be prepared for every emergency.
Tours faithfully, James Tolland.
It was a confounded nuisanoe. I had arranged to take the Bella m is
to the Scandinavian Exhibition this afternoon, and to dine and go to
the theatre with the Jacksons. Had to put off everything. Mary
Bellamy will be dreadfully annoyed. Wrote specially to her to
apologise and explain. They 're sure to get that beast Pom feet to
take them instead. He's always hanging round. Last week he wrote
a lot of verse in Mart's Confession Album, in this style (I copied
some of it out, in order to show it to Vulliamt, who hates him):—
Though, when he '• asked his favourite name, a man is apt to stare, he
Mutt answer, if he knows what's what, "My favouiite name is Mabt."
And this :— The vioe I detest and abhor above all
Is not dancing four times with you at a ball.
And this, in answer to the question, "What or who would you
rather be, if you were not yourself ? "—
I'd rather be the rosebud that nettles in your hair,
Or the aunt whose hand you took in youn and pressed upon the stair.
They all admired this slip-slop immensely, and Mast asked me,
when I called the other day, if I didn't think it wonderfully clever.
I know, when I wrote my answers in her album, it took me days of
thought to get them done in prose, and even then they turned out the
most ordinary, commonplace things. However I thought they pleased
Mabt, and now Pomfbbt steps in with his confounded rhymes.
Mrs. Bellamy's father onoe published a volume of verse, and is still
talked of in the household as " your grandfather the poet." She
told me that she thought "a faculty for versification was the mark
of a truly refined and delioate mind." Bah 1 Pomfbbt's one of
the most selfish and calculating ruffians outside a convict prison,
and always haggles over his luncheon bills at the Club, till the head-
waiter and all the rest nearly go off their heads.
However, I had to come to Billsbury, nilly-willy. Met the Com-
mittee after dinner. They were anxious that I should do some can-
vassing soon, and wanted me, when next I spoke, to explain myself
more fully (1) on the Temperance Question and the question of
Compensation to Publicans; (2) on the Women's Suffrage Question;
(3) on the Labour Question; (4) on Foreign Policy; and (5) with
reference to the Billsbury Main Drainage Scheme. I said I would,
bnt I should probably require more than one speech to do it in.
Afterwards a very solemn member of the Committee, whose name I
forget, got up and made a long speech, in which he observed that my
habit of appearing in dress clothes at the meetings had annoyed a
good many of my supporters, and that he ventured to suggest to
for my own good, that I should wear ordinary dress. It seen
good many of the lower lot thought it looked uppish. I'm glad
enough not to have to do it any more. There were other points, but
I'm too tired to remember them. By the way, I have subscribed to
about a dozen more Clubs and Institutions, and have promised to get
Mother to open a bazaar here at the end of the month. Baok to
London to-morrow. What a life!

been to Westminster this week. Hear, through usual
channels of information, that House adjourns to-day for
Whitsuu Recess. When I say House, I mean fragment
that remains; a few doors and chimneys, with here and
there a ruined wing. Fact is, majority absent with
influenza. Some seventy or eighty of us have formed
House of our own; meet regularly at usual hour; get
through business in a way that would astonish the
residuum left at Westminster: and jog off comfortably
for dinner. All Parties and all sections of Party
represented. Speaker and Chairman of Committees still
stick to Westminster. But we have Gobst, one of the
Deputy-Speakers, who presides with dignity and despatch.
Jackson looks after arrangement of business. Akers-
Douolas whips up the Conservatives, assisted by Sydney
Herbert and Arthur Hill. Thomas Esmonde brings

Have on the whole a very good time. Looked after by Rustem Roose, whose
cure is as alluring as it is infallible. "Eat drink and sleep," he says. "Lie

IN BE THE INFLUENZA.
(An Autobiographical Note on the appearance of the Epidemic in the
Law Courts.)
Owtng to recent sentimental legislation, many members of the
learned profession, to which I have the honour to belong, have found
their practice becoming (to quote the poet) "small by degrees and
beautifully less." Times were when
I could scarcely pass a week in term
time without appearing in Court
holding a consent brief, or armed
with authority to move (unopposed)
for the appointment of a receiver.
But that was long ago—a deep con-
trast with to-day — when my ad-
mirable and excellent Clerk Porting -
ton, finds an hour a day ample, almost
too ample, time for posting up to date
my Fee Book. However, occasionally
a gleam of the old sunshine illumines, Catching,
so to speak, the chambers I occupy, and suoh a gleam was my
retention for the Defenoe in the cause of Quicksilver v. Nore. Itwaa
a Patent Case, and one of the deepest possible interest. It is my
good fortune to know the Defendant ."personally, and it was through
his kind officei that the instructions to appear for him were left at
my chambers. My friend and client (who is unjustly said to be
eccentric in his habits) has recently patentedfand produced a most
important invention, whioh greatly facilitates the retention of dinner-
napkins, after those useful, nay, necessary articles have been used
for the purpose for whioh they are manufactured. Like all really
valuable inventions, the patent is simplicity itself, the napkin-ring
consisting of the section of the thioker end of an elephant's tusk cut
to an appropriate size and hollowed out. It is neoessary to fold the
dinner-napkin in suoh a fashion that, when inserted through the ring,
its shape is retained by the adherent properties inseparable from
the ivory. The patent can also be produced in other materials,
such as gold, silver and jewels for the wealthy, and in bone, tin and
even glass for purchasers of smaller means. I must say that when
the ring was shown to me I was greatly struck with the cleverness
and simplicity of the idea, and could not understand how Mr. Qcicx-
silvkr oould have allowed himself to be so badly advised as to bring
an aotion for infringement, merely on the strength of hit patent being
also a dinner-napkin-holder with the ring element so far introduced
that'it consisted of a circle olosed and opened by a hinge. However,
it was no part of my duty to advise the other side, so I set to work to
get up my case (as I invariably do) con amort. I hunted up all the
causes in the Digest, that seemed to'be on all-fours with the matter
in dispute, and spent days in the Pnblio Library of the Patent Office
searching for patents having to do with table-napkins. As the
specifications were not consecutively published, I had to wade through
a large number of these interesting documents that treated of other
subjects. For instance, the first specification I would take out of
the box in whioh it was kept, would perhaps have to do with house-
raising without disturbance to the foundations, the second would
Frove to be an article half umbrella, half revolver, while in the third
would perhaps find an extremely quaint notion for a portable
pocket corkscrew. I myself pioked up many ideas for future use,
and hope some day, if I do nothing else, at least to perfect a olever
little contrivance of my own for arousing the'inmates of a house in-
vaded by burglars by casement concussions. I propose calling this
valuable little instrument (whioh is founded to some extent on the
simple construction by whioh the figures in a ehild's box of wooden
soldiers are enabled to advance and retire in a scissors-like fashion),
when produced, the Policeman's Upper Floor Window Tapper.
The day for the hearing at length arrived, and, armed with a mass
of carefully selected information, I was in my seat ready to defend
the originality of the Nore Napkin Ring, so to speak, to the death.
In my notes before me I had the skeleton of a really fine oration,
which I felt (if I mastered my normal nervousness) would bristle
with epigram, and thrill with heartfelt, brain-inspired eloquence.
So deeply interested was I in the matter, that I scarcely listened
to my mend's opening, and only became aware of what was hap-
pening in Court by the rising of the Judge. Suddenly his Lordship
bowed, and disappeared. I looked at the clock—it was only noon—
and, consequently, an hour and thirty minutes in advance of the
time usually selected for the mid-day adjournment. And then, to
my dismay, I found that his Lordship was suffering from the in-
fluenza 1 Well, there was nothing to do but to collect my papers,
and, assisted by Pohttnotok, return to my chambers. The next
day my head ached violently, and I oould not move. Then I have a
recollection of dictating to my wife long telegrams to Portinoton,
which I subsequently discovered were neither despatched nor delivered.
When I awoke, I found that the matter of Quicksilver v. Nore had
been arranged and settled—out of Court I

itself felt in many different quarters."—The Timet.

Deliberately discerning
In me a noxious sham I

But now Economists toss over
Their idol of old days.

My road might yield some jolting,

Will probably get bogged,
And, lost in some dim bye-way,

OUR PARTICULAR TIP FOR THE DERBY.
(Furnished by the Odd Man Out.)
Looking through the List of Probable
Starters (who are all coming on well, and
might therefore be called, in the quaint turf
Italian, " comeystartert"), I cannot help feel-
ing that this year the Blue Riband of the
Turf will fall to the flower of the flock—as,
indeed, it should. But if it does not, why,
there are other really sound horses that are
sure to give a good account of themselves.
We may take it, that the winner will be out
of the common. As the glorious animal
passes the post, the cheers will be so deafen-
ing, that there will be a universal cry, "This
must be ordinance!" As the fun of the
Derby of late times has seen some revival,
the hero of the hour will, par excellence, be
the doll, whioh, in spite of many rivals, has
never ceased to be popular. Not that the
fun will be fast and furious—not at all; the
days of the Mohawks are over, and I am,
therefore, in a position to declare, that the
day when it is past and gone, will be ap-
propriately called a doroas meeting. And
this I can say with the less hesitation as I
rely on the power of a deemster. To everyone
the occasion will be pleasant, both to wise
men and persons of a simple sort; to adopt
the words of the historical Pieman, "for this
meeting fits Simon." And here let me re-
mark, that I am an enthusiastic admirer of
the perambulating gentleman who outwitted
the pas tie purchaser; in faot, " I go solid for
the Simoman." If the field is dusty on the
morning of the race, it will be following pre-
cedent. When I think of the Derby, I cannot
help remembering Henry the Eighth, for it
was to hold the Field of the Cloth of Gold
that that eminent monarch had to raise the
dust. Well might Francois Premier have
observed (as I do), "Bravo, Qouvemeur!"
If Dickens's naval hero, the Captain whose
words were always worth "making a note
of," were to use the belt of Orion as a support
in a sea of trouble, I should applaud his
wisdom. In faot, I should observe, that the
occasion was worthy of the Cuttle's tone.
And now to come to business. For after all,
what I have written above is merely a hint
to those who require no telling. A prophet
to be believed must be mysterious. But that
the simplest understanding may comprehend,
I give my final tip. Here it is. This year's
Derby will be won by one of two. It will
either fall to the Favourite or—the Field 1

OPERATIC NOTES.
Tuesday, May 19.—"With pleasant recollections of Mabxe Roze
and Babton McGccein, and, as I think, a Mr. Scobell playing the
swaggering: relative, I went to see Manon, at Covent Garden,
Miss Sibyl Sandebson being the Heroine, and M. Van Dtck the
Hero. The new
prima donna has
everything in her
favour, and very
soon she was in
favour with the
audience, but not
in such high
favour as was the
tenor with the
artistic name,
who, fairly tak-
ing the audienoe
by assault, con-
stituted himself,
pro tern., the man
in possession of
the ear of the
House. He is a
success; as a
young master

of so distin-
guished an Old
Master should be

be rude to say to
a really good Van

be Reszke methinks lacketh impassioned tenderness in the great duet
scene, where Alb am is inimitable; otherwise Jean is a gallant Raoul.
JEnsemble, as already said, which term includes ohorus, mise-en-tcene,
and orchestra under the energetic rule of Signor Bevignam, simply
perfect. Those who this season miss seeing Lei Huguenots with this
unexampled oast, will be justly upbraided by their children and
grandchildren. Mr. Covent-Gabdenia Hall with the Gladstone
flower in his button-hole, almost weeps to think that his much-
loved leader is unable to come from Dollis Hill and bestow his liberal
praise upon Let Huguenot*. Dbubiolantjs may well beam upon the

'ran-"' reply. Of course
much depends on the frame.] As for the new soprano Sibil—
more power to her organ! Her acting was good, but not great, and
what ought to be her song par excellence went for nothing, or, at
least, it could have been bought very cheap. There is far more
dialogue in Manon than a Covent Garden audience is accustomed
to, and this superfluity is resented by those who oome for the
singing, and who, if any talking is to be done, like to do it them-
selves. The three young ladies who go about together as a per-
petual trio, suggest the notion of a light and airy version, feminine
gender, of the thTee Anabaptists in the Prophete. M. Isnabdon as
Dei Qrieux, pere, a character that might be operatically nearly
related to Qermont, pere, in La Traviata, was impressively dramatic,
but deoidedly disappointing in his one great song, which ought to be
a certain encore. It may be true that an opera intended for a small
stage does not stand a fair chance of success on a large one. and
vice versa, as no doubt the Lord Mayor's coach provided by Dbu-
biolantjs Shebiffus for the occasion would look absurd on the
stage of the Opera Comique, while here when it comes round to the
gate to fetch Dee Grieux, it creates as great a sensation as ever it
would do in the Strand on the Ninth of November, even with the
Sheriff inside it.
Wednesday.—Speaking asan opera-goer of some thirty years' sitting,
I am inclined to assert that the performance last Wednesday of Lee
Huguenots beats the record, as will be allowed by all whose memory
runneth not to the contrary, "nevertheless" and "notwithstanding
being inoluded. Except Mario, as Raoul, and some add, exoept
Dobtjs Gras as the Queen, never was seen and heard so fine a per-
formance as is this to-night; and this deponent witnesseth that no suoh
ensemble has ever been seen for this really grand Opera. Strange to
hear sweet little Manon one night, and the next these overpowering
Huguenots. It is well worth the while, in Mr. Punch's pages, to re-
cord this exceptionally brilliant cast. First, Madame A lb am for the
heroine Valentino, superb alike in singing and in acting; Giclia
Kavogli as Urbano, the page, a memorable page in operatic history;
Conte di San Brit, by M. Lassallk, not to be bettered, as may be
also said of Signor Mibaxda (by kind permission of Shaespeabe's
Tempest, probably a descendant) as De Retz, afterwards converted,
and appearing as It Padre Basso, Superior of a Theatrical Order,
one of the exceptional Orders admitted after seven. Then M. Mau
eel, with his highly Maurel tone, cannot be beaten as the high'
minded Conte de Nevert; and Edouard de Reszke, taken altogether
—and there's a lot of him—is quite the best Mar cello that has been
heard and seen for some considerable time. Herr Formes and
Mabini were the rugged Huguenot soldier to the life, but they
weren't the Harmonious Blacksmith that Ned de Reszke is. Jean

added to the harmonious Royal Band, while the loyal public is

the subtle villain, Influenza, has been baulked in bis traitorous

It was Codltngbby Jcniob. who saved the Yraiblerman Party
after the battle of Bahborough. By sending a stern and staccato
epistle to the '' Jupiter Tonans" ; by praising (and imitating) Colonel
Db CAUcnsiKK, the real inspiring spirit in the camp of the victorious
Gkandolman, the maroh of the Hubbabub army was stopped—the
menaced empire of Vraibleusia was saved from the flowing tide of
Radical rain; the Harqnis of Stroxefoqies appeared in a blaze of
triumph that outblazed even the Berlin "Peace with Honour" busi-
ness, and Codlings by Junior " took the cake."
• •••••
The dinner over, the young men rushed from their Club (White's),
flushed, full fed, and eager for battle. If the Blues were angry, the
Buffs were also on the alert.
"I can have a dinner at any hour," said Codlingsby Junior;
"but a Blue and Buff row "—(a shillelagh here flying through the
window crashed "the cake" fromCodlingsbt's hand)—"a Blue and
Buff row is a novelty to me. The Buffs have the best of it, clearly,
though; the Cads outnumber the Swells. Ha! a good blow! How
that burly Cauousite went down before yonder slim young fellow in
the primrose pants 1"
"That is the Lord Tiddlkmpops," said a companion. "A. light
weight, but a pretty fighter," Codlingsby remarked. "Well nit
with your left. Lord Tiddlkmpops; well parried, Lord Tiddlkmpops;
elaret drawn, by Jingo 1"
"He never can be going to match himself against that Wire-
puller 1" Codlingsby exclaimed, as an enormous Caucusite—no other
than Schnaddy, indeed, the famous ex-Brummagem bruiser, before
whose fists the Blues went down like ninepins—fought his way
up to the spot where, pluckily, but a little too negligently, Tiddlkm-
pops and one or two of his young friends were bringing aristocratic
I laissez /aire to bear against the for titer in re of the fighting Caucusite
| Cads.
The young noble faced the huge champion with the languid
gallantry of his race, but was no match for the enemy's brawn and
biceps, and went down in every round. His organisation, in faot,
though fine, was not sufficiently firm and well-knit to face the
sinewy and skilful Schnaddy. The brutal fellow, who meant
business, had no mercy on the lad, who meant larks. His savage
treatment chafed Codlingsby Jdniob, as he viewed the unequal
combat from White's window.
"Hold your hand I" he oried to the Goliath. "Don't you see he's
but a novice?"
"Down he goes again! " the wiry Wirepuller cried, not heeding
I the interruption. "Down he goes again I I like whopping a
| swell!"
"CowardI" shouted Codlingsby. "The sight makes me feel
quite Dizzy. A Codlingsby to the rescue 1" and to fling open the
window, amidst a shower of malodorous missiles, to vault over the
balcony, and slide down one of the pillars to the ground, baring his
steely biceps in the process, and shying the "castor" from his curly
locks with all the virile grace of the Great Earl, was the work of
exactly five-sixths of a second.
At the sixth-sixth he stood before the enormous Wirepuller.
"Schnaddy, my boy," heexolaimed, "I'm going to fight you with
your own weapon—and wallop you. Look to yourself, churl
Caucusite I"
"Dizzy's Double, by all that's theotophical!" faltered Schnaddy,
shrinking at once to half his previous size, under the influence of the
startling sight, and the yet more startling "spank" from young
Dizzy's dexter bunch-of-fives.
• #••••
When Schnaddy, after six weeks' bed and bandaging, at last
came out of hospital, his oconpation as Wirepuller was gone.
Codlingsby Junior had stepped into his shoes, and the late
"Organiser of Viotory " and his Party had not " the least little bit of
a look in."

disciple, for whom his Master's every word possesses deep and subtle
meanings. He believes with George Eliot that "the words of
genius bear a wider meaning than the thought whioh prompted
them." That of course gives him unlimited scope, and sometimes
makes the explanations long; bat every lover of Brownim; will find
in the book a great deal of sound and helpful criticism well expressed.
Buy the book and see for yourself, says the Baron's A. R.
Fascinating is Oscae Wilde's paper "On the Decay of Lying,"
which is the first essay in a book of his entitled Intentions. If it be
true that the art of lying is decaying
—but, stay 1 how can anyone take the
word of a professor of the art of lying
for this or any other faot? No, his
motto must be, "See me reverse."
Not that by suggesting this motto I
would for a moment be understood
as expressing a wish for Oscar's once
again dropping into poetry — that
Oscab should once again take to the
other sort of Lyre; far from it. No; let
him remain the head professor of the
gay science of mendacity in the Cretan
College. Now, when a Professor and
double M.A., i.e., Master of the Mendacious Art in the Cretan College,
says or writes one thing, he must be taken as meaning exactly the
opposite. Otherwise he is no Cretan, and must be degraded from his
Professorship. Bearing this in mind, the essay is, as I have said, in
matter most amusing, and in style charming. Remember, my reader,
that whosoever and whatsoever is blamed, abused, or flouted in this
essay, is really being praised, lauded, and adulated to the skies by
the Cretan critic But when the M.M.A. writes on other subjects,
are we to trust him P there's the difficulty. So after the first essay,
wbich is hereby recommended by the Faculty, the Baron puts the book
aside. "Caute legendum," says BiB0N DE Book-Worms.

LEAVES FROM A CANDIDATE'S DIARY.
May 13<A.—Expenses keep mounting up. On Saturday received
a letter from Blissop (Secretary of the Association), stating that it
was deemed necessary to take a new Committee-room in Main Street,
and asking me if they might draw on me for the cost of furnishing
it, a matter of about £15. Replied that I must take time to consider
whether such expenditure was proper. Three more charitable institu-
tions olaim me as an annual subscriber, and the Billsbury Free Hos-
pital Committee have informed me that Chubson always gives them
£10 a year. Have had to do ditto.
May 14/A.—Had an extraordinary letter from Voxliamy this
morning. He is staying at Billsbury—but the letter explains itself.
Here it is:—
My Dkab Pattle, {Confidential.)
I am asked to let you know that a Committee Meeting has
been called for Friday 16th, and it is hoped that, at all costs, you
will make it convenient to attend. You know how great an interest
I have always taken in your career. I have always told you that
any experience I may have gained in electioneering matters (and I
have been at it for about twenty years now) is entirely at your
service. You will therefore forgive me if I speak quite frankly to
you on some questions which intimately concern your Candidature.
1 don't meet you as often as I should wish, and I am therefore im-
pelled to write to you on matters which require your serious conside-
ration, and on which you ought to be prepared to make a definite
statement on Friday next. I have used the opportunity of my stay
here to see how the land lay with regard to you. Hitherto you
have done very well, but mere public meetings will not win an elec-
tion, and you must make up your mind ere very long to come and
stay here, so as to canvass each ward, under the guidance of the
proper " officers."
Then there is the question of money I The Registration mutt be
paid for by the Candidate. It will he heavy this year. You can
talk it over with the Committee, hut certainly £100 to £150 will be
absolutely necessary. Whatever the sum is, you must be prepared
to pay it. I trust you will excuse my being candid with you, both
for your own sake and the Party's, ii £200 or £300 more or less is
any object to you, and if you (or your friendt) are not prepared to
do oertain things, such as bringing up voters, &c, it is useless your
hoping to win. I don't suggest bribery and corruption, but oertain
things not immoral, though perhaps illegal, must be done. That is
why I once suggested to you that someone from here should have an
interview with some friend who might represent you. You did not
respond to this. You do not appear willing to be guided by your
Committee even in the expenditure of £15 for ohairs and tables for
your new Committee-room; and I must repeat that such excessive
caution will not be followed by suocess. You will only waste your
time, and the Party here will be defeated. If you do not fesl willing
to be guided by the old Leaders of the Party here, who know what is
needed, far better reconsider your position, and resign while there is
yet time.
Now, in addition to your legal election expense! (between £500 and
£600), there wOl be the Registration whioh, nowever, is a permissible
payment. But, above all, railway fares, conveyances, and sundry
other expenses whioh are forbidden by the Act, must be met by your
friends, or success is hopeless. Young Habbison is standing at
Chursfield. His father intends him to win, and he will see to the
needful 11 That is the way to work it, and to win. You must be
prepared to pay at least £150 (or to get someone to pay it for you) for
tundriet. Even thus your expenditure will not reach £1000; dirt
cheap for a safe borough. Formerly a borough contest used to mean
£3,000, and a county anything up to £50,0001
I know you will believe me when I say that I have written entirely
in your own interest. Yours sincerely,
Hemky Pabkinson Vulliamy.
What an old rascal! I answered very shortly, merely stating my
intention of coming to Billsbury on the 16th, in order to interview
the Committee. I must nip all this in the bud, or chuok the whole
business.
Friday, May 15th, "George Hotel," Billtbury.—Came down to
Billsbury this afternoon. Had interview with a delegation from the
Committee in the Hotel. Moffat, Blissop, and Jebram were there.
They laid their views before me. Much the same as Vulliamy's
letter. "Shame to wreck the ship for want of a ha'porth of tar,"
said Blissop. "Gentlemen," I said, "if you think I'm going to
handle any of this tar, or do any dirty work, you are mistaken. I
am willing to help in the Registration and to pay proper subscriptions,
but I wont budge a step outside the Corrupt Practices Act, so far as
my election expenses are concerned. If you want someone who will
make illegal payments, go somewhere else. I'm quite willing to
resign. Now you know my opinion, and I leave you to confer with
your colleagues." With that I left them. Met them again two
hours later. All three looking thoroughly ashamed of themselves.
Said they had reconsidered the matter, and begged me to think no
more about it. They were determined, they said, to use only legal
means in fighting the election. So that blew over. Afterwards each of
them came to me in private, to beg my pardon, and put the fault on
the others. Moffat said it was Blissop, Blissop deolared it was
Jebbah, and Jebram swore that such a thing would never have
entered his mind if Moffat hadn't insisted on it.
Wrote to Voxliamy that I found he had entirely misjudged the
local feeling, and that, in any case, his suggestions were quite im-
practicable. He '11 detest me, but I don't care a brass farthing.

I would repay him by sending home the skins of all the

BOBERT AT THE ACADEMY.
WrrsusTinE being a rayther slack time with us Hed Waiters, ooz
our principle paytrons is all out of Town, I naterally sleeted that
week for my annewal yearly wisit to the Royal Academy. I never
ooud quite hunderstand why it was called a Aoademy, which I
bleeves is a rayther swell name for a Skool, but I hadn't bin there
long larst week afore I soon dishcovered the reason. In course it
stands to reason that lots of the werry wust of the bad picturs is the
work of werry young pupils, who haven't yet left skool, so that's
why they calls it a Aoademy insted of a Hinstitooshun or a Hexe-
bishun.
The fust thing as struck me wos the emense number of portraits of
peeple as noboddy never heard of, and therefore didn't want for to see,
ana I wanders how the poor peeple woud like for to be obliged to wark
about the rooms and hear the fun as the peeple makes on 'em. One
on 'em looks so werry cross, that a dent by me said as how he must
ha' bin taken when the bad news came from India. Another looks so
savage, that amost everybody asks him why he don't have it out and
done with it! Another werry savage sojer looked at me as much as
to say, "What are you staring at, Stupid f" which wasn't at all
perlite. Professor Huxley, I am told, is a werry great man, and so
he most suttenly seems for to think by the looks on him, and ain't he
jist got a lot of big books for to read I I was surprised to find as
there wasn't not no Lord Mare among the lot. His Lordship's state
robes wood have lighted up the hole place. And now for the reel
picters.
Fust and foremost of all the lot stands " The Flock of Sheep," by
Mr. Cooper, and as this happens to be one of the things as I does
understand, I makes no hesitation in saying, that there's about a
dozen of the werry finest saddles of mutton there as I ewer seed,
ewen at the honored Manshun House! Next comes the grand piotur
called " One and Twenty." Ah I ain't they jest a jolly set, and ain't
they all a drinking the young swell's health, and manny appy
returns of the day P Why you can amost hear 'em.
And now jest a word and a hint to all our great Painters. Pray
what is picters painted for F Is it to make peeple werry sollem, and
werry sorry, and werry unappy f Ain't we got reel trubbles, and
reel sorrows enutf in the world, without painting sham ones? And
yet I do declare that, arter looking at them two wnndurful picters
of " The Cruit," and " The Doctor!' and feeling as there wasn't not
no chance for either of the poor things to recover, that the kind
Doctor's trubble was all in wain, and that the poor Mother wood soon
have to bear the awfullest trubble as she ooud ewer know, I left the
place as fast as I ooud get out, for fear the peeple shoud notice the
big round tears as woud run down my silly old cheeks. Oh,
Mr. Filers, Mr. Films, to think that jest a few little delicate
touches of your magic brush woud have sent away thousands of appy
hearts, instead of hundreds of miserable ones, ort to make you
resolve always to put jest a gleam of hope in your wonderful
pictures in future.
There was about the same number of staggerers as ushal, and I
again arsks, who has the hordaoity to buy 'em? I wunder what
Mrs. Robert woud say if I took one home to my sober dwelling I
But, jest as I was a coming away, I seed one of the most howdacious
of the lot, and it was named " The Judgment of Paris " .' I had
off en heard as the French was werry free and bold in all these sort
of things, but I newer ooud have thort that our Royal Academy
swells ooud have so lowered theirselves as to condescend to submit
the whole of the Picters in the Exhibition to the judgment of the
Paris Painters, or that they wood have sleeted the greatest staggerer
as the one in their judgment the most worthy of the werry fust
prize. I don't think as it says much for their taste. Robert

The Timet says, sagely, " There is a good deal of human nature in

NOTES ON THE ROYAL ACADEMY 01? 2091.
"Richard, Duke of Gloucester, refusing the Crown." This picture
will be interesting to the hiatorioil student, as it affords a solution
to a knotty point that has puzzled commentators for the last five
centuries. The wily humpback is represented in his dressing-gown
and slippers, having evidently been oalled from his bath to listen to
the suggestion of the courtiers, who desire him to accept the regal
dignity. The umbrella of the Lord Mayor, we fancy, is of a later
date than the supposed period of the painting, but no doubt the |
artist has authority for the introduction of the quaint old lamp-post
illumined with the eleotrio light, which began to be used some little
time after the Battle of the Roses.
"Charles the Second in the Oak." This is also interesting to
those who delight in folklore. According to the legend (for no
doubt the story was merely a legend), the deposed monaroh was es-
ca ping from the Parliamentary troops, when he had to seek shelter in
the spreading branches of the tree that still is emblematic of England.
The artist has plaoed the leafy refnge near a stream, where Chables
seems to have been bathing. A tragic side (not entirely free from
quaintness) is given to the tale by the discovery of the temporarily dis-
carded wearing apparel of the Sttjabt by the soldiers, who are hunt-
ing him to the death. Chables, with his traditional good humour, is
smiling at an accident which causes him seemingly more amusement
than apprehension.
"The Battle of Trafalgar." The very clever arrangement of
smoke in this painting prevents the flesh-tints of the sailors from
assnming a prominence that might be objectionable to persons of
fastidious tastes. No doubt the artist felt that, if he had studied the
traditions of the British Navy at the commencement of the nine-
teenth or twentieth century (the battle was fought in that period),
he would have shown the gallant tars serving the guns in a costume
not more elaborate than that assumed by the nude inhabitants of the
North Pole. It is amusing to note in this connection that, until the
covery of the summit of the earth, it was supposed that the centre
of the Arctic Regions was bitterly oold. Our ancestors in the re-
mote ages had no idea that that
tiery region was, in reality, hotter
than the tropios 1
"Portrait of an English Gentle-
man of the Nineteenth Century."
— We are not quite sure that we like |
the unconventional treatment of the
accessories in this picture. It is
perfectly true that we find from con-
temporary rt cords that an invitation
to dinner was frequently accompanied
by the expressed wish that the guest
"was not to dress;" but still such
hints at the strange manners and
oustoms of a bygone age may be
carried out too literally.

do my best, and perhaps I had better begin at onoe, as they seem to
be getting—er—rather unruly at the further end of the room. (He
clears his throat.) Children, you must be very quiet and attentive,
and then we shall be able, as we purpose this evening, to show you
some scenes illustrative of the—er—beautiful old story of Valentine
and Orson, which I doubt not is familiar to you all. (Rustic
applause, conveyed by stamping and shrill cheers, after which a
picture is thrown on the screen representing a Village Festival.)
Here, children, we have a view of—er—(with sudden inspiration)—
Valentine's Native Village. It is—er—his birthday, and Valentine,
being a young man who is universallv beloved on account of his
amiability and good conduct (Tothe Vicar'sD. "IsthatoorreotP"
The V's.D. "Quite, quite correct! ") — good conduct, the villagers are
oelebrating the—er—auspicious event by general rejoioings. How true
it is that if we are only good, we may, young as we are, count upon
gaining the affection and esteem of all around us! (A Youthful
Rustic, with a tendency to heckle. "Et 'ee plaze, Zur. which on 'em be
ValentoineP") Valentine, we may be very sure, would not be absent on
such an occasion, although, owing to the crowd, we cannot distinguish
him. But, wherever he is, however he may be occupied, he little thinks
that, before long, ho will have to encounter the terrible Orson, the
Wild Man of the Woods! Ah, dear children, we all have our Wild
Man of the Woods to fight. With some of us it is (He improves
the occasion.) Our next picture represents (To Assistant.) Sure

pecting Valentine. So, often when we—&c, &o. The next scene
we shall show you represents the—er—burning of Valentine's ship.

only have patience, if we only have faith, &c, &o. Here we see—(an
enormous Bison is suddenly depicted on the screen) eh? oh, yes—here
we have a specimen of—er—Orson's pursuits. He chases the bison.
Some of you may not know what a bison is. It is a kind of hairy
oow, and (He describes the habits of these creatures as fully as
he is able. The Youthful Rustic. "Theer baint nawone a-erntin'

only—er—the bison, being a very fleet animal, has outrun his
pursuer for the moment. Sometimes we flatter ourselves that we
have outrun our pursuer—but, depend upon it," &c, &o. But now
let us see what Valentine is about (Discovering, not without
surprise, that the next picture is a Scene in the Arctic Regions.)
Well, you see, he has succeeded in reaching the coast, and here he
is—in a sledge drawn by a reindeer, with nothing to guide him but
the Aurora Borealis, hastening towards the spot where he has been
told he will find Orson. He doesn't despair, doesn't lose heart—he
is sure that, if he only keeps on, if he—er—only continues, only per-
severes—(Asi'de. What drivel I am talking! To Assistant. I say, are
there many more of this sort? because we don't seem to be getting
on !)—Well, now we come to—(a Moonlight Scene, with a Cottage in
Winter, appears)—to the —ah—home of Valentine's mother. You
will observe a light in the casement. By that light the good old
woman is sitting, longing and praying for the return of her
gallant boy. Ah, dear children, what a thing a good old mother
is! (To the Vicar's Daughter. "I really can not keep on like

fumbles.) Well, have you got them?

picture of "St. Elitabeth's Heroic Act
of Renunciation." In this instance the
Clarke got the better of the Abbott, and
the others, including Professor IIuxley,
who is always ready to rush in and in-
vite somebody to tread on the tail of his
coat, were nowhere. The Timet issues
its fiat, concluding the arguments on
both sides—"The Timet has spoken,
cauta finita ett"—and the picture will
remain one of the chief attractions in
the Royal Academy Exhibition until such time as it ascends to the
undisturbed Oilytium of The Happily Immortals. In the meantime,
being on the line, Mr. Caldebon will be perfectly satisfied
if his picture be generally recognised as "St. Elizabeth of Well-
Hung-ary."

Shred stale sentiment fine, just as much as you want,
And thicken with cynical clap-trap and cant,

Then lighten with squibs, whioh, of course, should be damp;

And you '11 find a few geese to taste it and praise you!

LEAVES FROM A CANDIDATE'S DIARY.
Billsbury, Thursday, MayJ.1—Came down here yesterday,
to
stay for a fortnight on end. Four meetings haye been arranged in
different wards, and a good deal of time is to be devoted to canvass-
ing. Pleasant prospect t Begin to think that, on the whole, it was
easier work to wear an oooasional wig in the Law Courts, or to sit in
Chambers, planning imaginary Law-books.
On Tuesday I lunched with the Bellamys, to say good-bye.
Mrs. Bellamy made herself very agreeable. Somebody, so she said,
had told her that my chances at Billsbury were excellent, and she
declared she had always admired young men who devoted themselves
with a single-hearted purpose to the service of their country. 8o
different from the orowd Of shallow-pates, who scorn laborious
days, And shun the rugged paths that lead to praise." This is a
familiar quotation from the works of "your grandfather, the poet."
Mrs. Bellamy quotes him on all possible occasions. A long time
ago she gave me a beautifully bound oopy of his book, " Per Ardua,
by Hewry Gattlbtoh, M A." I've
pleased to see us. They don't care twopenoe about real political
questions in the back-streets. They mostly say, "My father was a
Blue and his father afore 'im, and Pve bin a Blue all my life, and I
am t a goin' to change my colour now. You're all right, Sir; yon've
no oall to bother about me.> I wish you success." They don't mind
being asked any amount of questions as to where they lived before,
how long they've been in their present houses, and so on. It's all a
kind of entertainment to them. Here and there, of oonrse, you come
on a keen politician, who really understands. I hear Chorxle's
dinner to-morrow is to be a grand affair.
got a notion she has a whole room-
full of
the unsold copies, somewhere
at the top of the house.
After luncheon had a long talk
with Mart, who really looked pret-
tier than I've ever seen her. She
said, "Now that you have got into
what Mamma calls 'the vortex of
politics,' I suppose you'll despise
all our simple little amusements,
and begin to forget everybody except
the Billsbury voters." I asked her
how she oould say such a thing, told
her I never could forget the happy
hours I'd spent with her at Exhibi-
tions and dances, and so forth, and
assured her I loathed the Billsbury
voters (which, by the way, I really
think I do). I was just beginning to
screw myself up to the pitch of asking
her the question, in faot, I had taken
her hand, and was aotually stuttering
out something which made her look
down at her feet (she's got the
smallest and prettiest foot I ever
saw), when the footman opened the
door and announoed Pomfrrt. Of
course Pomfrrt must have seen
something was up. He's a beast,
but not a fool. But he chattered
away volubly, just as if he were the
most delightful and weloome person
in the world. I got so angry after
ten minutes of it, and my toes and
fingers began to have such an almost
irresistible longing to be at him, that
I thought it best to go. But Mary
gave me a look as I went away which
simply went right through me, the
kindest and most beautif ul look any
two eyes ever gave to an unhappy
man. I shut my eyes constantly and
bring the whole scene back, and in
imagination I throw Pomfrrt out of
the window, and oarry Mary in
triumph to the nearest ohuroh, while
her mother quotes the late Mr.
Gattleton's poetry over us in blessing,
again and find myself in this hole.
Dinner with the Chorkxes on Saturday.
May 23.—Started canvassing yesterday and continued to-day under
the oharge of Mr. Dikes, one of the Town Councillors. "Old Dickt
Dikes," the people here always call him. He's supposed to be one
of the most knowing cards in the whole county. A man of about
sixty-four, with light brown hair, rather curly, a wig, say his
detractors, but I can't make my mind up about it yet, as I haven't
been able to study him closely with his hat off. His head is large,
face a oross between J. L. Toole's and Dizzy's without the goatee.
Always wears a frock-coat of best broadcloth, and an immense top-
hat. Has one curiously protruding tooth which fascinates me, and
makes my attention wander when he's telling me his anecdotes. I
keep wondering how it ever got into that strange position—a sort of
dental rocking-stone, weird, solitary, inexplicable. Everybody
knows him, as he represents the St. Mark's Ward (which we are can-
vassing) in the Counoil. The flourish with which he always introduces
me is wonderful. I might be an Emperor honouring the place with a
visit. But the people take it all as a matter of oonrse, and seem

ADVANCE, AUSTRALIA!
(From our Special Correspondent at the Agricultural Hall.)
Need I say that I felt greatly gratified at finding myself attached
to the Yiotorian Volunteers. 1 had been present with them in spirit
at the banquets which had greeted their arrival to the Mother
Country, and now I was to have the
advantage of aotually appearing
bodily in their campaign at Isling-
ton. I knew the battle-field well.
In years gone by I had seen many a
Balaclava melee, many a slicing of
the lemon, many a securing of the
tent-peg. Nay, further. I had
assisted many a time at the com-
bined display," when, before a huge
audience, a presentment of war was
produoed, as unlike the real thing aa
anything well could be. But, to
return to the Victorians. As they
appeared in their neat uniforms,
which included slouoh hats, the
hearts of a noble people (represented
by occupants of places from ten
shillings downwards) went oat to
them, and they were greeted with a
n ighty shout. The English race
recognised the service that was being
done. The Mother thanked her Child.
Over the stormy sea had come the
soldiers of the Southern Cross to tell
any Britons still remaining in played-
out Europe how war should be waged;
how battles should be won.
The numbers of our gallant little
body were small; still, we had
enough. Before our appearance " the
country" had been arranged. In
the distance, near the southern en-
trance, were bushes; then, a little
nearer home, a second tow; then,
nearer still, a canvas erection repre-
senting a fallen tree; then more
bushes; and last, the door from
whioh we had emerged to receive the
plaudits of the populace. First,
two of our number (after some
slight hesitation) galloped (takiiig,
without muoh difficulty, the hedges
on their way) towards the south.
They fired. In the meanwhile the
rest of our body had dismounted,
and had buckled the forelegs of
eaoh horse so that it might not un-
duly wander. This clever idea was nearly crowned with sucoets.
Then tents were got out—without any hurry. They were pitched in a
leisurely fashion. Then the fire was lighted, also without flurry. The
two scouts now cantered back knocking over a bush on their way.
Shots were heard in the distance, and our camp was leisurely, very
leisurely, broken up. The tents were, with some difficulty, placed on the
backs of the horses, and most of our troopers mounted without serious
difficulty. One certainly was thrown, and another had to hold firmly
to his horse. Then we advanced. We again dismounted. One of onr |
body, after some negotiation, collected the reins of onr horses. We
fired, and again leisurely mounted. Then our troopers hurried off.
And when the magnificent display was over, I could not help
thinking how good it was of these gallant Colonists' to come so far
that we might learn so much. True, we had seen something a little
like the mounted infantry evolutions in the displays of our own light
Hussars. Again, soldiers have been known before this to pitch
and strike a tent Still, it was deeply gratifying to find history
repeating itself, inasmuch, as in the Viotorian evolutions there was
no difficulty in conjuring up the picture with the popular title,
"The Grandson teaching the Grandmother—how to suck eggs 1"

CHILD'S CHIT-CHAT.
[Possibly written for proposed insertion in certain of Mr, Punch's
Feminine Contemporaries.)
D basest Luna,—We are now book from Heme Bay, where, staying
at Mrs. '■* Boarding House, we met some of the smartest people.
If ever you visit this delightful watering-place, mind you look
Mrs. — up. She is a most charming creature, and the poulet rati
au sauce pain at the table d'hote, is simply charming. Her terms,
considering the company you meet, are very reasonable. Now, I
know you want to learn all about my new gowns. Well, the Pater
insisted that I should send to the Clothing Company, of ——,
for patterns. He says (dear old boy!) that we should patronise
British Industry." I got, amongst other delightful notions, the
cleverest idea possible in stripes, and intending to be very economical,
bought a paper pattern from in Street Well, I turned
out, all by myself, a most stylish frock, whioh Isahellk says suits
me to the ground. But the task exhausted both my intelligence and
industry. The rest of the materials I took to Madame . of
Street, and she is simply making
them lovely I I think I told you
that Madame is supplying
most of the dresses that will be
worn at Jf.ssik Joins' (you know,
the daughter of Lady Joints) wed-
ding. Lady Smith will look
simply superb in rhubarb-tart
satin, and the Countess of Col-
holsborouoh has a wonderful
gown made of squash - beetled
coloured velvet slashed with green,
that is sure to be the talk of the
Row until the end of the Season I
Of course, we have been to all
the Private Views. We miss the
Orosvenor very muoh, for the New
is scarcely a substitute. However,
I saw several smart people at the
latter place—some oi them ladies
of title, my dear. At the door I
found standing one of 's, of
Street, viotorias. They are
very nice, and, as they can be
bought on the three years' hire
system, most convenient. The
pictures at the Academy struck
me as rather dull this year. Of
course, everybody is muoh struck
with Mr. FiLDi»r" Doctor." By
the way, if the poor little patient
is suffering from influenza (as I
fanny he is), he would have ob-
tained immediate relief by taking
. But leaving medioal
subjects out of the question, there
are other gloomy pictures—besides
patients, heaps of prisoners, and
lots of paupers. Fortunately, most
of these last are "skied," whioh
is a blessing 1 I hear that the
Academicians have bought Mr.

ritqui, perhaps it is just as well that it should be buried in the
Diploma Gallery.
The usual gaiety last week. Mrs. Paragraph Prfsscuttehiit
gave a magnificent Ball at Square. The whole of the garden
was covered in by Messrs. , of Street, and the massed
Bands of the Cavalry Brigade at supplied the Music _ The
supper (furnished by Messrs. , of Street), was served in the
Lawn Cricket Saloon, and the gigantic apartment was crammed the
whole evening. I know you like reoipes. I extract the following
from 's Quids to Grub, a capital brochure published at a shilling.
"Pick, wash (in plenty of water), and drain 2 lbs. of crab-shells without
bruising them. Fare and core some well shaped apples. When these are
well heated, add the spinach. Cut into neat slices a dish of lamb's fry, and
fry it a nice brown in the bacon liquor. Boil all together till the syrup is
reduced to half the quantity, then lay the lemon peel on the apples, and pour
the syrup over them."
It is a Russian dish, and is called Boosh. _ You must tell me what
you think of it. Ever your most loving friend, Stllie.
ROBERT AT THE DARBY.
By sum strange cohinoidenoe as I ain't the least abel to account
for, the annual buthday of my muoh better half fell this year on the
grate Darby Day! and so we both agreed as weed have one more jolly
happy day together, ewen if so be as we never had another. So off 1
sets, and I takes two box seats houtside a homnibus and four spank-
ing Bays, I think they calls 'em, coz they was such a butiful dark
brown colour, and for which I paid no less than lis. Gd. a peace, and
with our pockets pretty well stuffed full of sanwiohes, and jest a nice
little flarsk of summut nice, never mind what, off we sets for the
City at nine a clock, hay hem, and at nine forty by the church dock
off we starts on our perrylus journey, reddy, as the Poet says, to dash
through thick and thin.
As it appened it was fortunet as we was so prepared, for, strange
to say, we hadn't got so werry far from Lundon Bridge, when, by
sum mistake of the Clark of the whether, as our jolly Coachman told
us, it began for to rain, but he said as how as he knowd as muoh
about the Darby wether as most men, as he'd driven there about
twenty times J in the larst duzzen years, and what we was a having
was ony a parsing shower. How
it was I ooudnt quite undustand,
for whether we drnv fast or
whether we druv slow, doose a bit
coud we get away from that
parsing shower. However, tho'
we did both get jolly wet, we had
sum capital fun, for we seed no
less than too coaches and four
upset in the road, and to see the
poor passengers all a standing in
the mud, which it was about
amost up to their nees, and a
wundering what time they shood
get to the Darby, was more than
ennff to console us, and we all
larfed artily and left 'em. Snoh
is human N atur 1
Before we both got quite wet
through, I got my best beloved a
seat inside, and, strange to Bay,
although she was werry muoh
sorowged, she axshally prefurrd
it to Betting out in the rain along
of me. It may have bin thorts

is human Naturl Luckily, jest
after she left me, one of our
wheels sunk down in a werry
deep ole, and all on us on my
side had to get down into the
fearful mud, and wait till our
gallant steeds pulled it out again,
and, unluckily, the one as pulled
hardest, let his foot slip, and sent
a reglar shower of whity-brown
mud all over me from top to toe,
or rayther, from At to Boots, and
I was in that orful state that all
our set, Coachman and all, acshally
roared with larfter. Such again,
I fears, is human Nature!
When we got to the Darby, in
course our fust thort was lunch,

until
buster of an ail storm that we was all drove hunder the homnibus
for shelter, and when it leaved off, and I went on the roof, the table
cloth was about three inches thick with round ale stones 1 Ah, that
was a difficult lunch that was, and beat all my xperience in that line.
I didn't see muoh of the race, I didn't, for as it pored in torrents
all the time, I had to seek for a shelter, and under a omnibus is not
a werry favrabel place to get a good view of a horse-race, but ewery
body seemed to speak of it as a werry common one, whatever that
may mean. However we was hamply reokompensed by the most
wonderful site as praps was hever seen in the shape of humberellers.
Heverybody had one, and heverybody put it hup, so, as my better
harf poetically expressed it, it was xaoly like a most butiful field of
henormous mushrooms a hopening out theirselves to the morning hair 1
We was remarkably fortnate in oumming back, as it didn't rain
near so much as it did in the morning, and quite left off jest as we
got home. My sweet darling didn't grumbel a bit at me for giving
her such a reglar damper for her birthday, but the werry larst thing
as she did say that night was, "Thank you, Robert dear, for your

OUR PARTICULAR TIP COMES OFF RIGHT 1
Yon may remember that last week, just before the
Derby, I furnished you with a prophecy. So that there
might be no doubt about it, I named the absolute First,
Second, and Third. Said I (page 255), " We may take it
that the winner will be found out of the Common." But
this was not enough. That all should secure One, Two,
and Three, I wrote, "Well might Francois Premier
have observed (as I do),1 Bravo, Oouverneur!'" implying
that the French horse was certain of a place. But I went
further still; I gave the Third. I carefully introduced
in my short article the name of every probable starter,
save Martenhurtt, who consequently became " the Field."
And what did I say of the Field? Why, "This year's
Derby will be won by one of two. It will either fall to
the Favourite or the Field." Surely this was good enough
to point out No. 3? Cheques from grateful backers may
be sent to 85, Fleet Street, addressed to

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.F.
House of Commons, Monday Night, May 25. — Members coming back in
slightly increased numbers. Harcourt returned from his wandering to and
fro. Akers-Douglas back after his influents experience; presently ooming up
to " tell" in a division, is welcomed by a cheer that rises as heartily from Oppo-
sition Benches as from Ministerial ranks. Jack-
son also back out of the Shadowed Valley; Gokst,
in his plaoe again, sprinkles fine pinohes of subli-
mated cayenne pepper upon Crawford and others
who want to know about Manipur.
But though various benches filled up with
familiar figures, Members look round in vain for
one; finding it not, will not be comforted. Where
is Old Morality P Last time he was seen was
on the Thursday preceding the holidays. He had
come back newly elected for the Strand; took
Sart in business of sitting; just before dinner
[embers had watched his lithe figure disappearing
towards the doorway, and he had been seen no
more. House had met again on the following
night; had adjourned for the truncated holiday;
had met again; and still Old Morality's seat
was vacant, and there dwelt in the fond memory
only that parting back view.
J ok i m occupying, but not filling, Old Morality's
seat, wanted to talk about various things; but ever
the conversation came back to the theme that filled
all thoughts. Harcourt wanted to know about
fixing the day for debate on Manipur; Henry
Fowler hankered after an understanding about
the Factory and Workshops Bill. Everybody but
J km my Lowther wanted to know about the
Education Bill; Tim Healy was curious to learn

House," said .Tokim. nervously rubbing his hands, "must await the
return of my Right Hon. friend, which we expect will be celebrated
on Wednesday."
"Well," said Habcouht, in one of his stage asides, "this is a
revelation indeed. Always thought Old Morality was an easy-
foing gentleman, deferential in manner, unassertive in action,
t seems he'e a regular tyrant, a sort of unapproachable Padishah. In
his bosom are looked all the secrets of State, all the purposes of
the Ministry. He takes no one into his confidence, but broods over the
destinies of the Empire in the haughty solitude of the watoh-tower at
Walmer. When he goes away for short holiday, publio business
entirely dislocated. No one can say or do anything exoept hoarsely
whisper his name. Jokim lives in a state of terror, and even the
martial spirit of George Hamilton cowers in recollecting his
?resenoe. Only shows how prone humanity is to error. We and the
ublio generally have created for ourselves an Old Mobality, a
genial, beaming, modest, unobtrusive personalty, always ready to
oblige, desirous of meeting the views of Members in all parts of the
House, anxious only to do his duty to his Queen and Country.
Whereas it is clear he is a martinet of the severest type, a ruthless
tyrant, a man who rules with a rod of iron, and keeps his followers
in a condition of abject personal terror."
Business done.—Vote on Account taken. Incidentally, Old
Morality's oharacter brought out in its true light.
Tuesday.—Amubath to Amubath sucoeeds. We had a Lord
Elceo, and, thank Heaven! we have one still—not exactly the
same, but curiously reminiscent
in voice and gesture. This suc-
cession of son to sire is one of
the happiest arrangements of the
British Constitution, one most pro-
mising for its maintenance and
prosperity. If the House of Lords,
peremptorily and selfishly, appro-
priated our Elchos and our Ga-
thobnk Habdys, turning them
into Earl of Wemyss, and Viscount
Chad b book, leaving us no substi-
tute or compensation, that long-
threatened institution would be
finally doomed. Bat, by bene-
ficent arrangement, when Elcho
and G at horn i: Hardy fared forth,
the one to become Earl of W em yss,
and the other Lord Ck and rook,
behold 1 there step into their places
other, and younger men, bearing
the old name.
Thus is the wi ad tempered to the
shorn lamb. The system works
beneficently in two ways. Like
the quality of mercy, it is not
strained. It blesseth him that
gives, and him that takes. The
House of Lords is strengthened by
the new recruits, and we still have
our Elcho to make jokes, and our
Hardy to preaoh sermons.
Listening to Elcho, jauntily
moving adjournment over Derby
Day, I say all this to the Sage
of Queen Asne's Gate, who shortly replies, "Fudge!" Remark
does not seem consequential; not at all sure that it is Parliamentary.
Long debate on Budget Bill; Habcoubt discourses at large on
Jokim s finance. Jokim site listening with amused air. Life is on the
whole to him a serious thing. But there is one episode that suffuses it
with a gleam of humour; that is to hear Harcoort talking Finance.
"One of the very few things," Jokim says, "of whioh he knows ab-
solutely nothing." Now J. A. Picton, on the contrary, thinks a good
deal of Habcoubt's aptitude for finance, and when Jokim had girded
at him for the space of half an hour, the Squibb of Mil wood had
the satisfaction of hearing Julius 'Annual Picton publicly desoribe
his criticism as " a most formidable attack on the financial scheme
of the Chancellor of the Exchequer."
Business done.—House agrees to make holiday on the Derby Day.
_ Thursday.—Old Mobality back to-night: everyone glad to see
him; with trumpets also and shawms would we have greeted him,
but Speaker ruled proposed demonstration out of order; so only
cheered. With exception of slight Italian aocent (particularly
noticeable in his pronunciation of the word "Newfoundland ") he's
just the same. Before sitting far advanced, wished he had lingered
for another twenty-four hours on the waters of the tideless sea.
Newfoundland Fishery Question on; the delegates to be heard
at Bar. Members, eager as school-boys for new sensation,
crowded the Benches, in expectation of half an hour's amusement.
Old Morality, fresh from Cabinet Council, knew that hope would
be disappointed. Government had decided to accept compromise
proffered by Newfoundland Legislature: consequently Sir William
Vallancb White way, K.C.M.G., would not appear at the Bar.
It is Old Morality's little way to put on appearance, in whatever
startling development of affairs, as if what was happening was
exactly what had been expected. To-night, at end of questions, he
quite casually mentions settlement arrived at, and proposes that
without debate Second Reading of Newfound-
land Fisheries Bill shall be taken. "A mere
form, you know," he said, nodding in friendly
fashion across the table at Habcoubt. "Every-
thing is amicably settled; we certainly won't
mention Bill again for three weeks, and then
only to withdraw it. Let us read it now a
Eeoond time just for the fun of the thing."
Crowded House sat for a moment in gloomy
disappointment, irresponsive to the cheerful
presenoe of Old Morality, who succeeded in
looking as if he had said something which,
though of no serious importance, was calculated
to be generally acceptable. Actual position
was something akin to what used to happen in
St. James's Hall when Manager came forward to
announce that, owing to sudden cold, Mr. Sou
ckves would not be able to sing. Members
glared round as if they were going to ask for
their money back; increasingly aggravating to
have Old Morality still nodding and smiling
on Treasury Benoh. If he thought they were
going to be put off in that way, should learn
e was mistaken ■ so Debate raged over three
hours, at end of which, Old Morality, swear-
ing he would ne'er consent to adjournment of
Debate, consented.
Just now, Akers-Douglas moved Writ for
New Election in the City, and for the moment
Members turned from Newfoundland to think kindly of genial,
hearty, honest " Yah! Yah !" gone over to the majority.
Business done.—Newfoundland Fisheries Bill shelved.
Friday.—Jokim had another tumble. Came down with light
heart at Morning Sitting, proposing to run Budget Bill through
Committee. Henry Fowler, certainly not an obstructive party,
objeoted, on constitutional ground, that Chancellor of Exchequer
was asking House to propose taxation for purposes not yet defined,
"Give us your Education Bill first," said Fowler, " and then we '11
vote the Budget that provides ways and means. No Education Bill,
no Budget."
Argument irresistible. Jokim meekly withdrew, and House took
up other business.
This continuous blundering not cheerful for Ministers: wonderful
how Akers-Douglas bears up; more than usually beaming to-night.
Don't understand till Gazette comes_out, when, looking down Birth-
After the Adjournment.

how deftly she can touch the lyre, and shows what a clever story-

will also secure a large audience among children of a larger growth.
Also look at Old Time Punishments, by Mr. William Andrews,
who gives an exhaustive account of anoient punishments, copiously

somehow doesn't "go.") I shall next endeavour to represent that
celebrated and tuneful singing-bird—the Sky-lark. (He does it,
but the Lark doesn't quite come off.) I shall next try to give you

at my door, and I answered it, and

told her. "I'm very sorry," I says,

after, as I was going downstairs, she

nothing had 'appened. Oh, jolly,"
I says, or somethink o' that sort—I
wasn't going to take no notice of her—

I says. "Oh, yes; nothing to stay in

didn't say nothing; and so it went on

me in the passage, and he said to me—

A DAY IN THE LAW COURTS
(A page from the Posthumous Diary of the late Mr. Pepys.)

[MR PUNCH'S "TABLEAU." SOCIETY IN COURT.]
Up betimes and to the Court at the New Palace of Justice hard by
the Strand, and near the sign of the Griffin which has taken the
place of Temple Bar, upon whioh did stand long ago the heads of
traitors. There did I see a crowd high and low trying to get in.
But the custodians and the police mighty haughty, but withal
courteous, and no one to be admitted without a ticket signed by the
Lord Chief Justice. And I thought it was a good job my wife was
not with me. She had a great longing to see a sensation action (as
the journals have it), and she being of a fiery disposition and not com-
placent when refused, might have made an uproar, whioh would have
vexed me to the heart. But in truth I found no trouble. It did
seem to me that they did not see me as I entered in. And plenty of
room and no crowding, at which I was greatly contented, as I love not
crushing. Pretty to see the crowd of fine folks 1 And there were
those who had opera-glasses. And when the Bench was occupied by
the Lord Chief Justice—a stately gentleman—and the other persons
of quality, how they did gaze 1 And the dresses of the ladies very
fine, and did make the place—which was splendid, and they tell
me the largest in the building—like a piece at the play-house 1
And the Counsel, how they did talk I Mighty droll to hear them
contradict! One would have it that Black was White; whioh con-
vinced me I had fallen into error, until another had it that he who
had spoken was wrong, and White was Black! Good laokl who
shall decide when Counsel differ f and I was mightily content that I
was not on the jury, although one of these good people did have the
honour of asking a question of His Royal Highness. And it was
answered most courteously, at whioh I was greatly pleased and con-
tented. Then did I hear the witnesses. In a mighty dread that I might
be called myself 1 For that whioh did seem plain enough when he
who was in the box was asked by his Counsel, did appear all wrong
when another questioned him. And the Jury, looking wise, and making
notes. And it is droll to see how oivil everyone is to the Jury, who,
methinks, are no cleverer than any of us f The Lord Chief Justice
himself smiling upon them, and mighty courteous I And met my
friend, A. Briefless, Junior, who it seems, is always in the Courts,
and yet doeth no business. And he did say that it was the strongest
Bar in England. And he did tell me how Sir Charles was eloquent,
and Sir Edward was clever at fence, and how young Master
Gill was most promising. And I noticed how one fair Lady, who
was seated on the Bench, did seem to arrange everything. And
many beauties there, who I did gaze upon with satisfaction. To see
them in such gay attire was a pretty sight, and did put my heart in
a flutter. And I was pleased when the Court adjourned for luncheon;
and it did divert me much to see what appetites they all had! Some
had brought sandwiches, and, how they did eat them! But the Lord
Chief Justioe soon back again, and more witnesses examined until
four of the clock, when the day was over. So home, and described
to my wife what I had seen, exoept the damsels.

LEAVES FROM A CANDIDATE'S DIARY.
Billtbury, Sunday, May 25.—Chobkle's dinner came off last
night. The dinner-hour was seven o'clock. Chobkle's house is in
The Grove, a sort of avenue of detached houses shaded by trees. The
Colonel himself was magnificent. He wore a most elaborately-frilled
shirt-front, with three massive jewelled studs. His waistcoat was
beautifully embroidered in black with a kind of vine-leaf pattern,
the buttons being of silver, with the regimental badge embossed
upon them. His handkerchief was a gorgeous one of blue silk. He
wore it in his waistcoat, carefully arranged, so as to show all round
above the opening. It looked something like the ribbon of some
Order at a distance. Mrs. Chobklx is rather a pleasant woman,
with a manner which suggests that she is much trampled on by her
domineering husband. How on earth she ever induced herself to
marrv him I can't make out. The ohief guests were Sir Chables
and Lady Pesfold. Sir Charles's father was a large Billsbury
contractor, who made no end of money, and represented Billsbury in
the House a good many years ago. He was eventually made a
Baronet for his services to the Party. The present Sir Charles
doesn't take much interest in.
politics, occupying himself
ohiefly in hunting, &c, but
they are people of great con-
sideration in Billsbury; in tact
Lady Pehfold is the leader of
Society in Billsbury, and not
to know them is to argue your-
self unknown. Sir Chables
himself is an Oxford man, and
we had a good deal of talk
about the old place.
"Yes," he said, " I was at
the House more than thirty
years ago, and to tell you the
truth, it's the only House (with
a oapital H), that I ever wanted
to be in."
The faot of the matter, so
Jebbam told me, was that Sir
Chables did once want to
stand for Parliament, but
somehow or other the scheme
fell through, and since then
he's always spoken rather bit-
terly of the House of Com-
mons. _ Their daughter, whom
I took in to dinner, is a very
pretty girl of nineteen, with
plenty to say for herself. She
told me they were going to be
in London for about three
weeks in June and July, so I
hope to see something of them.
Besides the Penfolds there
were Mr. and Mrs. Tollabd:
Mrs. Tollakd in a green silk
drees with more gold chains
wound about various parts of
her person than I ever saw on
any other woman. Two officers
of Chobklk's Volunteers were
there with their wives, Major
Wobbois, an enormous, red-
whiskered man who doesn't
think much, privately, of—
Chobkle's ability as a soldier, and Captain Yatmak, a dapper little
fellow, whose weakness it is to pretend to know all about smart
Sooiety in London.
Altogether there were twenty guests. Precisely at seven o'clock a
bugle sounded on the landing outside the drawing-room to announce
dinner. Everything in the Chohklk family is done by bugle-
oalls. They have reveille" at 7 A H., the sergeants' call for the
seivants' dinner, and lights out at eleven o'clock every night. As
soon as the call was finished, Chobklb went up to Lady Penfold.
"Shall we march, Lady Pbufold?" he said. "Sir Chables will
bring uj> the rear with Mrs. C." And thus we went down-stairs.
The dinner was a most tremendous and wonderful entertainment,
and must have lasted two hours, at the very least. There were two
soups, three fishes, dozens of entries, three or four joints—the mere
memory of it is indigestive. The talk was almost entirely about
local matters, the chief subject of discussion being the Mastership of
the Foxhounds. The present Master is not going to keep them on,
as he is a very old man, and everybody seems to want Sir Chables
to take them, but he hangs back. Difficulties about the subscrip-
tion, I fancy.
In the middle of dinner there was a fiendish row outside. I saw
poor Mrs. Chobklb turn pale, while tie Colonel got purple with
fury, and upset his champagne as he turned to say something to the
butler. Discovered afterwards that the disturbance was caused by
two of the young Chobklbs, who had got out of their bedrooms, and
were lying in ambush for the dishes. Hobbbs LEViATHAif Chobklb
had carried off a dish of sweetbreads, for which Sum ford
Thobougk Chobklb had expressed a liking. The result was,
that Hobbbs Leviathan got his head punched by Sirakko&d
Thobough, who then rubbed his face with sweetbread.
After dinner there was music, but not a whiff of

MITRED MISERY.

June cuh.—Rather gratifying to find that my service to the
Churoh—I don't mean Church Services—have at length been reoog-
nised. Just received intimation of my appointment to Bishopric of
Riohborough. How wild it will make my dear old friend, Canon
Stabbottle, to be sure 1 Well—I must accept it as a call, I suppose 1

made a Bishop was such an
expensive business. No end of
officials connected with Cathe-
dral, all of whom demand their
fee. After spending at least
£500 in this way, found there
was an additional fee of a
hundred guineas for "induc-
tion into the temporalities."
As there are no temporalities
nowadays, this is simply ex-
tortion. Remarked so to the
Dean, who replied (nastily, I
think), " Oh. it's for the inte-
rest of the Churoh not to have
paupert for Prelates." I re-
torted at once, rather ably,
that "I could not conceive a
better plan for bringing Pre-
lates to pauperism than the
iction of extortionate fees
at Installation." Dean re-
plied, sneeringly, "Oh, if you
don't value the honour, I sup-
pose there's still time for you
to resign." Resign, yes: but
should I get back my five or
six hundred pounds?

inquiry, find that fees at Min-

really have to consider whether there would be anything unepiscopal
in negotiating a little loan, or effecting a mortgage on the Palace.
Year Later, — Have been offered vacant Archbishopric! No,
thanks! Late Archbishop almost swamped by the fees, and he was
a rich man. I am a poor man—thanks to reoent preferments—and
can't afford it. An Archbishop in the Bankruptcy Court would not
look well. "His Grace attributed his position to expenses connected
with the various Installation ceremonies, and offered a composition of
one-and-sixp ence in the pound, which was unanimously declined by
the creditors." When will they do away with gate-money in the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
"BEROOFEN!»
"Well," quoth the Baron de Book-Wobms, as he sat down to
dinner on a Friday, a week ago, "I mast say I have never, never
been better in my life I Why, dear me, it ia quite a year since I
was ill!"
"Why ' Beroofen' ?" asked the Baron.
"It is a spell against the consequences of boasting," the lady
explained. "My mother was a bit of a magician."
And you, my dear Countess, are bewitching. Your health!"
And, pledging her, the Baron drank off a bumper of Pommery '80
tret tec, and laughed joyously at the notion of his rapping the table
— all ''table-rapping" being a past superstition, or supperstition
when not at dinner,—and murmuring, Beroofen!" And so he
didn't do it. "Beroofen " never passed his lips: the champagne did;
but not " Beroofen."
• ••##•
"Ugh I—I feel so shivery-and-livery. Ugh!—so chilly. Here I
Send for Dr. Ronsox Roostex Pasha I" cried the Baron, clapping
his hands, and a thousand
ebon slaves bounded off to
execute his commands.
Had they not done so,
they themselves might
have suffered the fate in-
tended for the commands,
and have themselves been
rapidly executed.
* • • •
*' You've got 'em,"
quoth Dr. Robson Roostkm
"Not 'again'!" oried
the Baron, surprised, never
having had 'em before.
"No: the phenomena,"
said the Eminent Medico.
"Have II"' murmured
the Baron, and sank down
into his uneasy chair. It
was an awful thing to have
the Phenomena. It might
have been the measles in
Greek. Anything but
that! Anything hut that.'
But Dr. Roostf.m explained
that "phenomena" is not

Greek for measles, though
one measle;" but
this
perhaps Phenomenon might be Greek for
would be singular, very singular.
"I must tap you." continued the friend-in-need. "No—no—
don't be alarmed. When I say 'tap,' I mean sound you."
Then he began the wood pecking business. In the character of
Dr. Woodpecker he tapped at the hollow oak chest, sounded the
Baron's heart of oak, pronounoed him true to the core, whacked him,
smacked him, insisted upon his calling out" Ninety-nine," in various
tones, so that it sounded like a duet to the old words, without much
of the tune—
"I'm ninety -nine,
I'm ninety -nine 1"
the remainder of which the Baron had never heard, even in his
earliest childhood.
So it was a quarter of an hour of inspiration, musical and poetic:
and, at its expiration, Dr. Mark Taplet, as the Baron declared
he must henceforth be called, announced that there was nothing for
it but to make the Baron a dose prisoner in his own castle, where he
would have to live up to the mark, as if he were to be shown, a few
months henoe, at a prize cattle-ehow, among other Barons of Beef.
"Champagne Charley is your name, so is Turtle soup, so is succu-
lent food, and plenty of it. Generally provision the fortress, and
withstand the assaults of the enemy. If a bacillus creeps in through
a loophole, knock him on the head with the best champagne at hand,
and, if you 're not worse in a day or two, you '11 be better in a week!
Au revoir!" Exit Dr. Mask Taplet.
• •••••
And so the Baron remained within, and sent for his books, and
above all One of Our Conquerort, by "The Geo. If.," who is the
Cablyxb of Novelists. The first volume was missing. In a few days
it had returned. The first chapters, however, seemed still wan-
dering. But the Baron was better, and could follow them slowly,
though not without effort, wondering whither he was being led. When
he arrives at Chapter VII., unless the novelist ceases to meander, the
Baron will exclaim with Hamlet, "Speak! I '11 go no further!"
Yet, 'tis marvellous olever and entertaining withal.
Perhaps there will be a vacation

after this attack of
infortunate Baron. Alas! for the present, it is La
who is " One of Our Conquerort!"
• • • • •
This morning, after a fortnight of it, the Baron was about to
announce that he was better, bnt at the outset he paused, corrected
himself, and, tapping the breakfast-table with his fork, he exclaimed,
"Beroofen.'"
Moral.—Be quite sure you're out of the wood, though maybe
you were never in it, and even then don't congratulate yourself.

getting " Greno," all such being excellent Fizzio for the Epidemic), as

OPERATIC NOTES.
We'be quite the gay Frenchmen now at the Italian Opera: Fautt
in Frenoh, Manon in French, Romio et Juliette in Frenoh, Le
Prophete in Frenoh; American siegers, and Dutch singers—for if Mr.
Yak Dtck isn't as muoh a Double Dutchman as Va.ndebdecken or
any other Van, except Pickford & Co.'s, then am I myself a Dutoh
native—and, by the way, I'm always equal to a dozen of 'em any
time during the right and proper season. Not for many a long day
and night has there been a better show at Covent Garden. Miss
Eah£8, the Brothers De Rrzke, Van Dick, Melba; the two
Ravooli girls, speoiaily Gidtja, as tuneful contralto; Maubel, the
cultured artist; Si by l Sandkhs on, the simple ohild of Nature:
Agnes J arson, with more sauce Hoilandaise; marvellous Mbavina
for the French Queen, "with a song;" and, above all, Madame
Albani, in tip-top voioe, acting and singing better than ever.
Tuesday.— June 2 was a Diamond Night in front. H.R.H.'s
present: Diamond Queens and Princesses of Society all on view.
Dbumolanus, in his glory, beams on everyone.
Wednesday.—State Ball counter-attraction to Opera. Won't do to
in rumpled silks and satins, and drooping feathers, like hens after
,ue rain, to a Court Ball. So Opera suffers; those present trying to
look as if they had been invited to State Ball, but didn't care about
going, or oo uldn't go, on account of recent family affliction. How-
ever, as Dbubiolanus is reported to have appeared in full fig at
State Ball, he couldn't expeot others less interested in the perform-
ance than himself to out the Court and come to the Opera. To-night,
M. Plancon as Mephistopheles, a thinner demon than Brother
Ned de Rwzke, but un bon diable tout de mime.
Friday Night.—Notable for excellent performance of Rigoletto, or
The Little Duke and The Big Duck respectively personified by
Signor Ravklli and Giulia Ravooli. Three "R" s in such a
combination. Quite "R's Poetica." Beg pardon.
"Tag" on the week,—if our friends in front are pleased as they
appear to be, then Dkukiolanus and Council—not the County, but
the Covent Garden Council—are satisfied. Curtain.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Messrs. R. Osgood & Co. in advertising Miss Sarah Okm f. Jbwett's
book, Strangers and Wayfarers, quotes an extraot from one of Mr.
Russell Lowell's letters, which runs thus:—
"I remember once at a dinner of the Royal Academy, wishing there might
be a toast in honour of the Little Masters, such as Tenniel, I)u Maukibr,
and their fellows."
He " wished" it, but was the wish a silent one, or did it find ex-
pression in a speech'( No matter: there are the Old Masters and the
Young Masters, there are the Middle-A Red Masters; there are the
Great Masters; and, according to Mr. Russell Lowkll, there are
"the Little Masters," without any middle term at all. "The Little
Masters," like children in the nursery of Art, not admitted to
dinner, but who oome in afterwards for dessert. May they come
in for their just deserts, as no doubt they will some day. Well,
according to this Lowell y estimation of merit, these would be the Lesser
Masters, and after them the No Masters at all, except perhaps the
Toast-Master a. Bat why not follow a kind of public school classifi-
cation whioh divides one form—of course all the artists belong to
the very best form,
and, like Sir Frbde-
bick the President,
show the very best
form — into several
compartments, so that
we should have in one
form sav, the Fifth,
Upper Fifth, Middle
Fifth, subdivided into
Upper and Lower
Middle, then Lower
Fifth, with a similar
subdivision? Orders
of merit to be worn in
the button-hole could
then be distributed,
and a new Order of the
"B P.",not "British
Pablio," but " Brush
and Penoil," could be
instituted, to be en-
titled fully, "The
Masters of the Black
and White Art."
In the Fortnightli/,
besides an article on
the prevailing epi-
demio, by Sir Morell
MACKENZIE, M.D.,

much the sort of gene-
ral advice that was
given by Mr. Justice
Starleigh to Ravi
Welter, to the effect
that "You had better

ever you are, who
read this short, but
generally interesting
paper. There is an
anonymous paper on an imaginary election at the Royal Aca-
demy, noticeable only for an excellent imitation of Mr. George
Meredith's style. The Novelist is supposed to look in casually,
and, finding an eleotion imminent, he offers sage words of counsel,
and then begs to be allowed to "float out of their orbit by a
bowshot." It seems to me that the paper was written for the sake of
this one short paragraph, which, as a close parody, is inimitable.
A Modern Idyll, by the Editor, Mr. Frank Harris, is, as far as this
deponent is concerned, like the Rule of Three in the ancient Nursery
Rhyme, for it "bothers me," and, though written with considerable
dramatio power, yet it seems rather the foundation for a novel

finish. Alter Hego {in the Office of the B. de B.- W.)
But no! it was not to be. They must seek for help from another
quarter! Suddenly there emerged from the darkness a strange-
looking structure, that with its lights seemed bent upon running them
down. They signalled for help, and the groteique vessel was hove to.
"What do you want?" asked a gruff voioe, to their great delight,
in English. "What are you a haling us for?"
"We are shipwreoked travellers," explained the spokesman of the
party; "and we ask for conveyance to a place of safety."
"A place of safety—sounds like a cab-stand," muttered the other.
"Well, jump in." Thus invited, the shipwrecked travellers entered
what seemed to them to be a welcome harbour of refuge. But they
had not proceeded far when the man who had already spoken to
them again addressed them.
"Come—all of you—turn out—but first pay me," and then he
mentioned a considerable sum of money.
"Have you no mercy P" cried a fair-haired girl, pointing to the
white and rain-drenched locks of her ancient parents.
"Not a bit, Mias," returned the semi-savage, with a hideous grin.
"And who are you, rude man?" Bhe asked, plucking up in her
very despair some spirit. "Are you the Captain?"
"Much the same
thing—I am called the

"And what is the
name of this dreadful

questioned the damsel,
with a shuddering
glance at what seemed
to be a straw-Btrewn

[Fragment from a Romance, Founded upon a Modern Strike.)
It was a dark and stormy night. The wind howled, the rain
pelted, and the poor travellers were drenched to the skin. They
shaded their eyes, and peered forth into the blackness to see if
succour was at hand. Their strength was exhausted, and they felt
they could go no further. Oh 1 what would they not have given to

THE TRAVELLER'S

(A Hint for the coming

Deab Mb. P unch,—
As we are within
measurable distance of
the time when every-
one will be thinking
of going abroad, per-
haps you will allow me
to make a practical
suggestion. No doubt
you will have observed
that, according to the
Correspondent of the
Times, recounting the
"recent railway out-
rage in Turkey," the
Brigands "chose five
_ of the most opulent-
'looking of their vic-
tims, and told them that they meant to hold them to ransom." I am
not surprised at this occurrence, for something of the same sort onoe
happened to me. I am very well to do, and I am fond of what I believe
is vulgarly called " globe-trotting." I do not care to be encumbered
with too much luggage, and if there is a thorn to the rose of my sweet
content it is the objection that my wife makes to my personal appear-
ance. She will have it that a suit of thoroughly comfortable dittos
is not the proper garb for a stroll on the Boulevards des Italiens, or
a lounge on the Piazza San Marco. As for my wide-awake, she
declares (and I can assure you that I have not had it for more than
ten years) it is absolutely disgraceful 1
But to my story. I have said that I myself was once attacked by
Brigands. Our train was stopped in strictly regulation fashion.
I believe the customary number of engine-drivers, stokers, and
guards were shot, or otherwise accounted for. Then the pas-
sengers were inspected. I was rather nervous, for, truth to tell, my
pockets were lined with untold gold and notes. The Chief of the
Brigands—a most gentlemanly person—glanced at my coat with a
slight shudder of pain, and then raised his eyes to my head-gear.
That seemed to satisfy him. "Set him free! "he cried to the two
ruffians who guarded me, "and never let him see me again I" I
never did 1 Yours sinoerely,

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIAEY OF TOBT, M.P.
House of Common*, Monday, June 1.—House of Commons, as
usual at this time of Session, driven against wall in its struggles
with appointed work. With brief recesses, been at work since
November last. One thing everyone insists on is that Prorogation
shall take place at end of July. Difficult to see how even by most
masterly management that can be accomplished. Apart from Educa-
tion Bill, enough work in hand, if Supply be fairly dealt with, to
carry us on to last week in July. Every moment precious; every
quarter of an hour lost an irretrievable misfortune.
Accordingly, to-day, meeting in the freshness and vigour of new
week, House takes up a local Bill dealing with pilotage in Bristol
Channel. Two or three Members talk about it for hour and a half.
House neither knowing nor oaring anything on subject, empties;
Division bell sounds through all the rooms and corridors. How is a man
to vote when the question abruptly submitted is, "That the Pilotage
Provisional Orders No. 1 Bill be now read a Second Time f" Still,
it's as well to vote, as it runs np average attendance on Divisions, at
which at election times constituents sometimes glance. Fortunately,
in this case, Michael Beach, as one of Members for Bristol, took
part in Debate and Division. As useful this as sign-post to belated
traveller at four cross-roads. Conservatives and Liberals crowded at
Bar keep their eye on President of Board of Trade, watching which
way he would go. He led the way into the " Aye" lobby. Thither
followed him all the Conservatives, all the Liberals trooping into the
"No" lobby. When Noses were counted, it was found that 165
voted "Aye," 119 "No." And thus it came to pass that the Pilotage
Provisional Order No. 1 Bill was read a Seoond Time.
One gathered from chance expressions, and especially from the
interest taken in the affair by Members for City of Bristol, that
Bristol had special interest in the Bill. In addition to Michael
Beach's support, Weston on Liberal side, Hill on Conservative
Benohes, supported Seoond Reading. Sinking political differences,
Member for East Bristol, and Member for South Bristol, agreed upon
plan of campaign.
"You, Westow," said Colonel Hilt, who, having obtained his mili-
tary rank in the peaceful pursuits of commercial shipping, is a master
of strategy, " speak so low that they can't hear a word you say,
whilst I, concealing a miniature speaking-trumpet in my mouth,
will roar at them as if a stout North-Easter were blowing through
the lanyards of our first battalion, deployed in open order."
Tactics succeeded admirably. Sir Joseph Wbston, a mild, alder-
manic person, presented himself from quarter behind Front Opposi-
tion Bench, and, to all appearanoes, delivered an admirable address.
His lips moved, his right hand marked the rhythm of his ordered
speech; now his eyes flashed in reprobation, and anon smiled
approval. But not a sound, save a soft murmur, as of distant
dripping waterfall, was heard. JOBnfant Prodigut wasn't in
it for successful pantomime.
When the movement stopped, and the Alderman was discovered to
be sitting down, the martial-nautical Hill sprang up from Benoh
on other side, and the stillness was broken by a rasping voice, that
woke Dicky Temple out of his early slumber. The strategy,
cleverly conceived, was admirably carried out, and Bristol, thanks
to diversified talent of its Members, got its Bill. _ Only it seemed
a pity that an hour and a half of precious publio time should inci-
dentally have been appropriated.
Burin*** done.—Irish Land Bill in report stage.
Tuesday— House of Lords the scene of a thrilling performance to-
night Usually meets for business at half-past four. On Tuesdays, in
order to give Noble Lords opportunity for preparing for exhaustive
labours, publio business does not commence till half-past five.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

"Accommodated with a Seat.1
Punotuall y at that hour, a solitary pedestrian might have been
observed wafting np the floor of the historic Chamber. A flowing gown
hid, without entirely concealing, hisgraoefnl figure; a f nil-bottomed
wig orowned his Btately head, as the everlasting snows veil the lofty
heights of the Himalayas. He looked neither to the right hand nor
to the left, but with swinging stride strode forward. At the end of
the Chamber stood the Throne of England, on which, in days gone
by, Habcourt's Plantagenet fathers sat, and in whioh some day—
who knows ?—the portly frame of him who now proudly bears the
humble titlet Squibb of Malwood, may recline.
But that is another story. The gowned-and-wigged figure ob-
served walking up the floor of the House of Lords at half-past five
on a June evening, was not making for the Throne. Before that
piece of furniture stood a bench, in appearance something like the
familiar ottoman of the suburban
drawing-room. It was the Wool-
sack, and the svelte figure, swing-
ing towards it with the easy stride
of superlative graoe and compara-
tive youth, was the Lobd High
Chancellor! Before him, at re-
spectful distance, went his Purse-
bearer, ready to produce the where-
withal should his Lordship desire
a pick-me-up by the way. Behind
him came the Mace-bearer, and, a
foot further in the rear, Black Rod.
Odsfakins! a stately procession,
whioh ought to have been set in
the centre of an admiring multi-
tude. But the Lobs Chanckllok's
springy footfall echoed through an
almoBt empty chamber. Denman
was faithful at his post, ready to
move that some Bill be read a
Second Time on that day nine
months. Here and there, on widel y
severed benches, perched a Peer,
whilst from the Gallery, where he
had been accommodated with a seat, the smiling mobile face of Mr.
Justice Day peered forth. He had just looked in on his way home
from the Courts, interested in a scene where some day he may take
his place as Brother Br am well and Brother Colebidge have done.
The keen eyes of the great Lobd Chancellor flashed round the
ohilling scene. Clerk at the table mumbled something about
Provisional Orders.
"Those that are of that opinion say 1 Content,'" observed the Lobd
Chancellor. "Contrary, 'Not Content;' the Contents have it.
This House will now adjourn."
Then uprose the Lobd High Chancellor, and with the same
stately swinging step, moved towards the
doorway, with the Purse-bearer, the Maoe-
bearer, and Black Rod in his train. It
was twenty-five minutes to Six; full five
minutes had elapsed since the HouBe of
Lords met. Now House of Lords had ad-
journed, and the throbbing pulses of an
Empire on whioh the sun never sets beat
with steadier motion, knowing that all
was well. Business done.—House of Lords
adjourned.
Thursday.—Rather a painful scene just
now between Prince Arthur and the
Squire of .Malwood. T. W.
Russell proposed new Clause
on Irish Land Bill, whioh
provided for reinstatement of
evicted tenants; received with
general applause, and finally
agreed to. In the midst of
general congratulations and
shaking hands, the Squire
lounged in, and with many
back-handed slaps at the
Government, added his ap-
proval to the general chorus.
The Ministry were hopelessly
bad, but this clause, though
proposed by a supporter of
theirs, was moderately good.
"Singular thing," said
Prince Arthur, in meditative

Balfour, Q.C.
tone, as if he were talking to himself, "that the Right Hon. Gen-
tleman oan never interfere in debate, however far removed the
subject may be from the arena of Party Politics, without forthwith
dragging it into the arena."
"That," said Balfour, ft.C, who ohanoed to be on the Front
Opposition Bench, "is a striking example of the misapprehension under
whioh acute minds occasionally labour. I have known my Right
Hon. friend for many years: we have sat on this Benoh together in
Opposition, and have worked in the same Ministry, and I confess it
is a little shocking to me to hear him aocused of tendency to enter
upon controversial topios. I am myself a man of peace, and do not
readily assume an attitude of reproof; but, as Mr. Henry Arthur
Wilson said when he stood over the improvised Baocarat-table with
a piece of chalk in his hand, the line must be drawn somewhere, and
I am inclined to rule it at the place where my friend Harcoust is
accused of wilfully and designedly disturbing the Parliamentary
peace." Business done.— Still on the Land Bill.
Friday Night.— StiU grinding away at the report stage of Land
Bill; don't get any forrader; been at it a week, and to-night just as
many Amendments on the paper as there were on Monday. All
night upon a single new Clause. Everybody wearied to death.
Even Windbag Sexton a little moody; not had such a good night
as usual; the debate lasting throughout sitting, and, there being
only one Motion before the House, Sexton (with the Speaker in the
Chair) could speak only once; that he did, at considerable length.
But a poor oonsolation for lost opportunity.
Congratulated the suffering Speaker on this accident; pointed out
to him things were bad enough; but might be worse.
"I suppose, Toby," he Baid, "you never read Prior? Haven't
looked him up for many years; but, sitting here through this week,
there is one oouplet—from his Solomon, I think—ever running
through my mind:—
'A bra was ready ere I called her name;
And, though I call'd another, Abba came.'
Jost like Sexton."
Business done.—One Clause added to Land BUI.
"GREY APES OF AGE."
"Grey hair is fashionable for the youthful,"
Says a Mode oraole acknowledged truthful.
Strange that Society should have a rage
For that anomaly—artificial Age I
Dust on their heads our pretty women toss,

quoting from the Middlesex County Times, last Saturday, stated
that, The Lord Chancellor had added the name of Mr.
W. S. Gilbert, Poet and Dramatitt, to the Commission of the
Peace fur the County of Middlesex." So is it said that another
"W. 8.," one William Shaxsfkarb—who, by the way. also had a
Gilbert in the family—was, in his latter years, made a J.P."
Mr. William Shakspearb Gilbert—if he will kindly allow us so to

LEAVES FROM A CANDIDATE'S DIARY.
BUlsbury, Wednesday, May 28<A.—Great
doings here to-day. For weeks past all the
Conservative Ladies of Billsbury have been
hard at work, knitting, sewing, painting, em-
broidering, patching, quilting, crocheting,
and Heaven knows what besides, for the
Bazaar in aid of the Conservative Young
Men's Club and Coffee-Boom Sustentation
Fund. Tou couldn't call at any house in
Billsbury without being nearly smothered in
heaps of fancy-work of every kind. When
I was at the Penfolds' on Monday after-
noon, the drawing-room was simply littered
with bonnets and hats, none of them muoh
larger than a crown piece, which Miss Pen-
fold had been constructing. She tried several
of them on, in order to get my opinion as
to their merits. She looked very pretty in
one of them, a cunning arrangement of forget-
me-nots and tiny soraps of pink ribbon.
Moti.er promised some time ago to open the
Bazaar, though she assured me she had never
done suoh a thing before, and added that I
must be sure to see that the doors moved
easily, as new doors were so apt to stick, and
she didn't know what she should do if she
had to struggle over the opening. I com-
forted her by telling her she would only have
to say a few brief words on a platform, de-
claring the Bazaar open. For the last week
I have had a letter from her by absolutely
every post, sending draft speeches for my
approval. After muoh consideration I selected
one of these, whioh I returned to her. I heard
from home that she was very busily occupied
for some time in learning it by heart When
cook came for orders in the morning, she was
foroed to listen while Mother said over the
speech to her. Cook was good enough to
express a high opinion of its beauties.
Yesterday evening Mother arrived, with the
usual enormous amount of luggage, inoluding
the inevitable Carlo. After dinner I heard
her repeat the speech, whioh went off very
well. This is it:—" Ladies and Gentlemen, I
am so pleased to be here to-day, and to have
the opportunity of helping the dear Conserva-
tive cause in Billsbury. I am sure you are all
so anxious to buy as many of these lovely things
as you can, ana I therefore lose no time in
deolaring the Bazaar open." Simple, but
efficient
The opening to-day was fixed for 2 30, the
Basaar being held in the large room of the
Assembly Booms, whioh had been arranged
to represent an Old English Tillage. At one
o'clock Colonel and Mrs. Chobkle, Alderman
and Mrs. Tolland, and one or two others,
lunched with us, and afterwards we all drove
off together in a profession of carriages. I
insisted on Carlo being left behind, locked up
in Mother's bed-room, with a disk of bones
to comfort him, and an old dress of Mother's
to lie on. That old dress has been devoted to
Carlo for the last two years, and no amount
of persuasion will induce Carlo to take
another instead. We tried him with a muoh
better one a short time ago, but he was
furious, tore it to ribbons and refused bis food
until his old disreputable dress had been
restored to him.
The Bazaar proceedings began with a short
prayer delivered by the Bishop of British
Guiana, an old Billsbury Grammar-Sohool
boy, who was appointed to the bishoprio a
month ago. Everybody is making a tremen-
dous fuss about him here of course. As soon
as the prayer was over, Colonel Chobkle rose
and made what he would call one of his
"'appiest hefforts." The influence of lovely
woman, Conservative principles, devotion to
the Throne, the interests of the Conservative
Toung Men's Sustentation Fund, all mixed
up together like a hasty pudding. Then
oame the moment for Mother. First, how-
ever, Williamina Henrietta Smith Chob-
kle had to be removed outside for causing
a disturbance. Her father's speeoh so deeply
affeoted this intelligent infant, who had come
under the protection of her nurse, that she
burst out into a loud yell and refused to be
comforted. The Colonel's face was a study—
a mixture of drum-head Courts-martial and
Gatling guns. Mother got through with her
little speeoh all right. As a matter of faot
she read it straight off a sheet of paper, having
finally decided that her memory was too
treacherous. We both set to work and bought
an incredible amount of things. After half
an hour I found myself in possession of six
bonnets made by Miss Pen fold, three knitted
waistcoats, four hand-painted screens, two
tea-tables also hand-painted, a lady's work-
basket, three fancy shawls, a set of glass studs
and a double perambulator, whioh I won in a
raffle. Mother got three dog-collars, a set of
shaving materials (won in a raffle), two writing
oases, five fans, two piotures by a local artist,
four paper-knives, two carved cigar-boxes, a
set of tea things, and five worked table-covers.
When we got baok, we found that Carlo
had nearly gnawed his way through the bed-
room door, and was growling horribly at the
boots and the chambermaid through the key
hole. Charming dog!
Simian Talk.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI,
Listen, Bet, from your comfortless seat on the turned-
uj> pail,—if yon 've got the time;
Isn't it qneer that Society's cleansers mutt pass their
lives amidst muck and grime? [" swell" and sweet,
Spotless flannels no doubt are nice—and snowy linen is
But steaming reek is around our heads, and triokling
foulness about our feet.
If the dainty ladies whose linen we lave, we laundress
drudges, could look in here.
Wouldn't their feet shrink back with sickness, and
wouldn't their faces go pale with fear?
White, well-ironed, all sheen and sweetness, that linen
looks when it leaves our hands;
But they little think of the sodden squalor that marks
the den where the laundress stands.
Scrub, scrub, sorub, at the reeking tub, for eighteen hours
at a stretch, perchance,
Till our bowed backs ache, and our knuckles smart, and
the lights through the steam like speotres dance;
Ankle-deep in the watery sludge, where the tile is loose
or the drainage blocked!
Oh, I haven't a doubt that the dainty dames—if they
only knew t—would be sorely shocked.
Typhoid! Terribly menacing word, the whisper of which
■would destroy our trade;
Bat dirt, and damp, and defeotive drainage will raise
that ghost on a world afraid;
And at thirty years our strength is sapped by insidious
siege of the stifling fume, [fort such fife illume.
Or what if we linger a little longer? Scant rays of corn-
Grievances, Bft? Well, I make no doubt that the
world of idlers is sorely sick
Of the moans and groans of the likes of ms. When the
whip, the needle, the spade, the piok,
Are all on strike for a higher wape, 'tis a worry, of
course, to the well-to-do, [offioial to me and you.
And a sleek Home-Sec. must " decline to pledge " support
Of course, of course I Who are we, my dear, to bother
the big-wigs and stir their bile r
Why, it 's all along of our "discontent." and the
Agitator's insidious guile. [aided pacts,
But Labour, But, is agog jnst now to revise the old one-
And even a Laundress may have an eye to the benefit
of the Factory Acts.
Those bad, bad 'Busmen, Bet my girl, claim shorter hours,
and a longer pay; [we women not have our say
J ast think of snob, for the 81aves of the Tub! Why should
In the Park o' Sunday, like like Dah the Docker, or Ton
the Tailor, or Will the " Whip"?
The Tub and the Ironing-board appear to have got a chance
—which they mustn't let slip:
An Object Lesson in Laundress Labour, may move the
callous and shame the quiz.
We dream of "Washing as well it might be" ; we '11
show them "Washing as now it is."
We know it. Bet, in the sodden wet and the choking
fume; with the aohing baok,
The long, long hours, and the typhoid taint, the inverted
pail and the hurried snack.
There may—who knows ?—be hope for us yet, for you and
me, Bet I_ Just think o' that!
Oh, I know it is hard to believe it, my girl. The Sweater's
strong, and appeal falls flat [against us go;
On official ears; and fine-lady fears, and household hurry
But " evil is wrought by want of thought." says some
poet, I think ;—to we'll let them know!
Ah! snowy sheets and sweet lavender scent of the dear
old days in my village home!
The breadths of linen a-bleaoh on the
thought that to this I'd come
Grand ladies of old to their laundry looked, and the tubs
were white, and the presses fair;
Now we cleansers olean in the midst of dirt, in a dank,
dark den, with a noisome air.
Sometimes I dream till the clouds of steam take the
shadowy form of a spectral thing,
A tyrant terror that threatens our lives, whilst we rub and
scrub, whilst we rinse and wring.
Well, cheer up, Bet, girl, stiffen your lip, and straighten
your back. You nave finished your grub.
So to work once more; if our champions so ore, we may
find a new end to this Tale of a Tub 1

STRIKING INTELLIGENCE.-A Page from a Londoner's Diary.
Sunday.—Can scarcely believe the news I What, no omnibuses 1 A strike 1
What shall we do f Fortunately always go to church on foot, so no loss in that.
Then subiequent parade in the Park—don't require an omnibus for that, either.
At the end of the day, ean say that, take one thing with another, state of affairs
more comfortable than might nave been anticipated.
Monday.—Dreaded continuance of strike, but found, practically, little incon-
venience. Had to walk to the office, and enjoyed the promenade immensely.
Had no idea that a stroll along the Embankment was so delightful. After all,
one can exist without omnibuses—at least, for a time.
Tuesday.—Find that people who were at their wits' end .at the mere sug-
gestion of a strike, are becoming reconciled to the situation. Streets certainly
pleasanter without the omnibuses. Great, lumbering conveyances, filling up
the road, and stopping the traffio! London looks twice as well without them I
Tradesmen, too, say that the shops are just as well attended now as when the
two great Companies were in full swing.
Wednesday.—Can't see what the omnibus people (both sides—Directors and
tmployft) are quarrelling about. No matter of mine, and the Public are only
too glad for a chance of a good walk. Fifty per oent. better since I have been
obliged to give up the morning 'bus. Asked to-day to contribute something in
support of the strikers. Certainly not, the longer the strike lasts the worse for
the Public.
Thursday.— Keally the present state of affairs is delightful. I have to
thank the deadlock for teaching me to patronise the river steamboats. Pleasant
journey from Vauxhall to the Temple for a penny 1 No idea that the Thames
was so pretty at Westminster. Yiew of the Houses of Parliament and the
Embankment capital.
Friday.—Strike continues. Well I do not complain. Hired a hansom and
find that considering the cab takes you up to door, it is really cheaper in the
long run. If you use an omnibus, you get jolted, and run a chance of
smashing your hat. If it rains you geti splashed and having to finish your
journey on foot, you might just as well have walked the whole way.
Saturday.—Strike arranged to cease on Monday I This is too muoh I Just as
we were getting comfortable, all the disgusting lumbering old omnibuses are to
come back again I It ought not to be allowed. Asked to-day to contribute some-
thing in support of the strikers. Certainly, the longer the strike lasts the
hotter for the Public

(A Prophetic Forecast, by a Professional
Pessimist.)
1891. The Leader of the House explains,
in answer to a question, that no understand-
ing exists between England and any Foreign
country. No treaty is in contemplation,
and never has been suggested, on either side.
1892. The Government repeats that Eng-
land is absolutely free from any international
engagements. It most not be thought for a
moment that a single battalion will be moved,
or a solitary vessel dispatched abroad with
warlike intentions.
1893. The Representative of the Cabinet
once more denies the suggestion that, under
any consideration whatever, will England
bind herself to accept European responsibility.
This has been said constantly for the last
three years, and the Representative of the
Cabinet is not only surprised but pained
at these frequent and embarrassing inter-
rogations.
1894. Once more, and for the last time, the
Premier insists that whatever may happen
abroad, England will be free from inter-
ference. It has been the policy of this great
country for the last four years to steer clear
of all embarrassing international complica-
tions. The other Great Powers are perfectly
aware that, under no circumstances whatever,
will our Army and Fleet be employed in taking
part in the quarrels of our neighbours. The
entire Cabinet are grieved at questions so
frequently put to them—questions that are
not only disquieting abroad, but a slur upon
the intentions of men whose sole duty is the
safety and peace of the British Empire.
1895. General European War—England in
the midst of it!
VOCES POPULI.
BEFORE THE MECHANICAL MODELS.
A Sketch at the Royal Naval Exhibition.
Scene—The Grounds. A tiring of Sightseers discovered pasting
slowly in front of a row of glazed catet containing small
mechanical flguret, which art let in motion in the utual manner.
Before a Scene representing a Dying Child.
A Gallant Swain. That's the kid in bed, yer see. Like to see it
die, Polly, eh P A penny does it.
Polly (with a giggle). Well, if it ain't too 'arrowing. (The penny
it dropped in, ana the mechanical mother it instantly agitated by the
deepest maternal anxiety.) That's the mother kneeling by the bed,
I suppose—she do pray natural. There's the child waking up—
see, it 'a moving its 'ed. (The little doll raises iltelf in bed, and then
falls back lifeless.) Ah, it's gone—look at the poor mother 'idin' her

The G. 8. Well, it's all over. Come along and see something
more cheerful.
Polly. Wait a bit—it isn't 'alf over yet. There 's i angel got to
come and oarry her away f uBt—there, the door's opening, that '11 be
the angel come for it, I expect. (Disappointed.) No, it's only the
dootor. (A jerky and obviously incompetent little medical practitioner
putt his head in at the door, and on being motioned back by the be-
reaved mother, retiree with more delicacy than might have been
expected.) Well, he might ha' seen for himself if the child wat
dead! (The back of the bed disappear!, disclosing a well-known
picture of an angel flying upwards with a child.) I did think they'd
have a real angel, and not only a picture of one, and anyone can see
it's a different child — there's the child in bed just the same. I
call that a take-in I
The G. 8. I dnnno what more you expeot for a penny.
A Perton on the Outskirts (eagerly to Friend). What happened?

A Softhearted Female. No, I oouldn't stand there and look on. I
never can bear them pathetio subjects. I felt just the same with
that pioture of the Sick Child at the Academy, you know. (Medi-
tatively.) And you don't have to put a penny in for that, either.
Before another Bedroom Scene representing "The
Drunkard's Delirium."
First Woman. That's 'im in bed, with the bottle in his 'and. He
likes to take his liquor comfortable, he do.
Second Woman, He 'a very neat and tidy, considering ain't he f

penny in as the gentleman give yer. (Rosy, aged six, sacrifices her
penny, under protest.) Now, you look—you oan't think what pretty

[The little wooden drunkard sits up, applies the bottle to hit
mouth, and tinkt back contentedly; a demon, painted a
pleasing blue, rises tlowly by hit bed-tide; the drunkard
taket a languid interett in him; the demon sinks.

A Gentleman, in a white tie (at the machinery stops). Well, a

Proverbs pro Omnibus.—Directly the Chairman of the General
Omnibus Company observed that if the men's demands were conceded
the fares would have to be raised, there was a rush to be the first out
with the old proverb about Penny wise and Pound foolish. However,
"In for a penny" remains as heretofore, the employe's having suc-
cessfully gone "in for a Pound." Let them now " take care of the
pence," and they may feel well assured that this particular Found
will be able to take care of himself. Well, farewell the tranquillity
of the streets of last week! Henceforth not "chaos," but "'Bus
'os," has oome again!

Dear Ms. Punch,—I hear that some people are in a great state of
mind lest some blessed Bill brought in by the Govern-
ment, should "destroy Voluntary Schools." What
howling bosh I Why, there are no Voluntary Schools!
No, they're all Compulsory, confound 'em! or who'd
attend 'em? Not Yours disgustedly,
A Human Bot.

Me. Willer & Co., and the 'Bus Strike.—Mr. ^
Suthkrst seems to occupy, as towards the 'Bus-drivers,
a similar position to that nlled by the eminent Mr. Solo-
mon Pell, the general adviser, and man of business to
the Elder Mr. Welter, and his professional coaching brethren. It is
to be hoped that the Solomon Pell of the 'Bus-drivers has been
treated as liberally as was the real Mr. Pell, the friend of the Lord
I Chancellor, by Mr. Welter Senior, the Mottle-faced Man, and others.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The most interesting book, one of the Baron's Retainers ("blythe
and gay,") has read this year is, The Life of Laurence Oliphant.
If it were not written by a reputable person, and published by so
eminently respeotable a house as Blackwood's, there would be
difficulty about aooepting it
as a true story of the life of
a man whom some of us
knew, as lately living in
London, wearing a frock
ooat, and even a tall hat
of oylindrioal shape. Suoh
a mingling of shrewd busi-
ness qualities and Maroh
madness as met in Laurence
Oliphant is surely a new
thing. A man of gentle
birth, of high culture, of
wide experience, of supreme
ability, and, strangest of all,
with a keen sense of humour
—that suoh an one should
voluntarily step down from
high social position at the
_ bidding of a vulgar, selfish,
•Cii» i I _w self-seeking, and, according
to some hints dropped here
and there, grossly immoral man, should, at beok of his fat forefinger, go
forth to a strange land to live amid sordid oiroumstanoes, and with
uncongenial company, to work as a oommon farm-labourer, to
peddle strawberries at a railway station, passes belief. With respect
to Mr. Harris, one feels inolined to quote Betsy Prig's remark
touohing one who may, peradventure, have been a maternal rela-
tion. I don't believe," said Betsy, "there's no sich a person."
But there was, and, stranger still, there was a Laurence Oliphant
to bend the knee to him. Not the least striking thing in a book of
rare value is the manner in which Mrs. Oliphant nas acquitted
herself in a peculiarly difficult task. No man would have had the
restraining patience neoessary to deal with the Harris episodes as
she has done.
The Assistant Reader has been refreshing himself with Lapsus
Calami, by J. K. S., published by Macxillan and Bowes. It is
a booklet of light verse, containing here and there some remarkably
brilliant pieoes of satire and parody. The firBt of two parodies of
Robert Browning is unsurpassable for successful audacity. The
last poem in the book is "An Eleotion Address," written for, but
apparently not used by, the present Postmaster-General, when he
was Candidate for Cambridge University, in 1882. He says of him-
self, after confessing to a dislike for literature and science,—
"But I have fostered, guided, planned I Some ten or twelve directors, and
Commercial enterprise; in me | Six worthy chairmen you may see."
All the pieoes are not so good as those oited—that would bs too much
to expeot—but " get it," say Baron de Book-Worms & Co.
Mortuary.
Andrew Language—no, Lang !— who the classics is pat ia,
Suggests to our writers, as test of their "style,"
Just to turn their equivocal prose into Latin,
As Dbtden did. Truly the plan makes one smile!
Reviewers find Novelists' nonsense muoh weary 'em.
Writers of twaddle
Take Dry den a model—
Turn your books into some great " dead language "—and bury 'em!
WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN TOLD DOWN EA8T;
Or, A Mauvais Jew d'Esprit.
Will you, if you please, point out to me the way to the streets
whioh, I am told, are paved with gold P
Where shall I find the employer of labour who, I have been told,
will instantly get me occupation at a wage of 60 roubles the week?
Dear me! is this, then, your " White Chapel "PI was told it was
a luxurious quarter, famous for its Palaces.
Surely this horrid den is not one of your model work-rooms P I
was told that suoh things existed only in Russia!
And are these people who are scowling at and oursing me your typioal
working population P Why, I was told that I should find them
dear brothers, waiting to welcome us with open arms.
And is this pittance you offer me all that you pay for making a
coat? I was told that it was quite twelve times as muoh as this.
Ah! I'm afraid I have been told, and have given credit to, a
great many things to whioh I never should have listened at all.

SHORT-LIVED PLEASURF.
Portrait or A Literary Friend, who, i ivinq in a Main Thoroughfare,
WAS AN ARDENT SUPPORTER OF THE 'BUS STRIKE, SUBSCRIBED TO ITS FUNDS,
AND HOPED IT MIGHT LONG CONTINUE. He SATS HE HASN'T HAD SUCH A QVIBT
Time with his Books tor Years. But alas I since last Sunday he has
NOT SMILED AGAIN.
MRS. GINGHAM ON THE GREAT 'BUS QUESTION.
"The demand for 'Buses ia immensely stimulated by their presence, and when they are
no longer there, the people who thought them indispensable get on very well indeed without
them . .. Under the influence of penny fares, Londoners are rapidly forgetting how to
walk."— The Time*.
Ah I it's all very fine, my good Sir, whosomever yon are as writes snob,
But of deoent poor folk and their needs it is plain as yon do not know much.
Which I ain't quite so young as I was, nor as light, nor as smart on my feet,
And yon may not know quite what it is to be out late o' night and dead beat,
Out Islington way, arter ten, with a bundle, a child, and a cage,
As canaries is skeery at night, and a seven mile walk, at my age,
All along of no 'Bos to be had, love or money, and cabs that there dear,
And a stitch in my side and short breath, ain't as nice as you fancy,—no fear!
Likeways look at my John every morning, ah I rain, hail or shine, np to town,
With no trams running handy, and corns I As I sez to my friend Mrs. Bhown,
Bless the 'Buses, I sez, they 're a boon to poor souls, as must travel at times,
And we can't all keep kerridges neither, wus luck! Penny Fares ain't no onmes,
If you arsk me, as did ought to know. Which my feelings I own it does rouge
To hear big-wigs a-sneering at 'Buses. There may be a bit of a sorouge,
And the smell of damp straw mixed with pep'mint ain't nice to a dalioot nose,
Likeways neat " Oh be Joyful's" a thing as with orange and snuff hardly goes.
But we ain't all rekerky nor rich, we can't all afford sixpence a mile,
And when we are old, late, and tared, or it's wet, we can't think about style.
The 'Bus is the poor body's kerridge, young feller—and as for your talk
About not never missing a lift, or forgetting—dear Bakes I—how to walk,
And the nice quiet streets and all that; why it's clear you ain't been a poor olerk
With a precious small " screw," in wet weather. Ah! you wouldn't find it no lark
With thin boots and a 'ard 'acking cough, and three mile every day to and thro',
Or a puffy old woman like me, out at Witsuntide wisiting Job,
(My young son in the greengrocer line); or a governess, peaky and pale,
As has just overslep herself slightly, and can't git by cab or by rail.
"Ugly lumbering webioles f" Ah I and we 're ugly and 'umbering too,
A lot of us poor Fenny 'Bus fares, as isn't high-born or true-blue.
But the 'Bus is our help. Wery like some do ride as had far better walk,
Whether tip-toppy swells or poor shop-girls. But all that is trumpery talk.
What I arsk is, why shouldn't the 'Buses be kept a bit reglar, like Cabs,
In the matter of fares and of distances? Oh, a old woman it crabs
To hear of Perprietors pinohing pore fellers as drive or oonduok,
While the " Pirates" play up merry mag with the poor helpless fare, as gets
■tack
Betwixt Dividend-grinders and Strikers? It ought to be altered, I say.
Whilst they talk of what 'Bus-folk should earn, they forget the pore Publick—
who pay!
LE PRINCE 8'AMUSE.
An Apologetic Idyl.
My life is held to be a round of Pleasures;
All I can say is, they who thus would rate it,
For life's delights have most peculiar measures:
For though in plainest English they don't state it,
'Tis clear "no recreation" meets their views,
Or why that sneering cry, "Le Prince s'amuse t"
Or do they think a Prince, without repining,
Foundation-stones unceasingly is laying,
Rewarded with a glut of public dining,
The pangs of hunger ever to be staying,
Is recreation such as he would choose f
If so—I understand " Le Prince s'amuse!"
But how a world that notes his daily doings,
The everlasting round of weary function,—
The health-returnings, speeches, interviewings.
Can grudge him some relief, without compunction,
Seems quite to me "another pair of shoes I"
Dyspeptic is that cry," Le Prince s'amuse!"
THE MODERN BRIGAND.
(Fragment from the Adventures of a Ransomed Prisoner.)
I must oonfess I was agreeably surprised at the treat-
ment to which I was subjected by my oapturers. Instead
of being loaded with chains and confined in a cell beneath
the castle's moat, I was given perfect liberty, and had
quite a pleasant suite of rooms. I should scarcely have
known that I was in durance had not one of the less
refined of the brigands shown me a revolver, and play-
fully informed me that its contents were intended for me
if I attempted to escape. The Chief was absolutely
charming. He treated me in the most courteous manner,
and ended his first interview with me by requesting " the
honour of my company at dinner."
"You need not dress I " he observed, "although I like
to put on a tail-coat myself. But I know that yon have
had some difficulty with my people about your luggage,
and so I shall be only too delighted to excuse grande
ienue."
The " difficulty" to which my host referred was the
seizing of my portmanteau by the gang of thieves of
which he was the acknowledged head. I suggested that
I might possibly recover some of its contents.
"lam afraid not," returned the Chieftain. "You see
my people are very methodical, and by this time I fear all
the goods will have been sold. The motto of the Club is
'small profits and quick returns.' We find no difficulty
in trading. As we carry on business on the most econo-
mical principles, we can quote prices even oheaper than the
Stores."
And this I found to be the case. Although the brigands
were very civil to me, I was unable to trace any of my
Eroperty. However, as my host in the kindest manner
ad allowed me to dispense with ceremony, I ventured
to appear at dinner-time in my ordinary tourist's dress.
"I am delighted to see you," said the Chief, speaking
English for the first time, '' as you are now my guest, 1
must confess that we are fellow countrymen."
'' Indeed 1" I replied, considerably astonished. "If you
are really of British nationality, how is it that I find you
a professional thief?"
"You are mistaken," returned the Chief. "I merely
belong to a society for the redistribution of capital. You
know we are all balloted for, and I was myself afraid
that 1 might get pilled."
'1 Indeed 1" I exclaimed, in a tone of surprise. _'' Surely
your accomplishments—for I noticed, on my arrival, that
yon were a first-rate hand at lawn tennis, and played the
flute—would have secured your admission?"
"Well," be returned with a smile, "I fancy they
helped me with the Committee. But unhappily my ante-
cedents were bad—I had made a fortune on the London
Stock Exchange, and my books were scarcely as satis-
factory as our bandit auditors could have desired them
to be. However they took a kindly view of the case,
and allowed me to pass through. But pardon me, I see
your ransom has arrived. I am afraid I must say good
bye. A pleasant journey."
And shaking me warmly by the hand, he helped me
into the conveyance that was to take me back to home
and freedom. I have never seen him

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A COY COLOSSUS.
Paris, June 15.—It is stated
here, on no authority what-
ever, that when the Czar was
recently visiting the Frenoh
Exhibition at Moscow, his
Imperial Majesty was heard to
remark, "This makes me de-
sire to see the Boulevards
again." A visit of the ruler of
Russia to Paris during the
Summer is therefore considered
to be certain. An offensive
and defensive Alliance between
the two countries is said to be
on the point of signature.
A few evenings ago, in a
low cafe in Belleville, M.
Nokashikoff, who left St.
Petersburg lately to escape his
creditors, and who conceived
the happy idea of raising a
little money by walking to
Paris in a sack composed of
the French and Russian
national flags stitohed to-
gether, was entertained to
supper by his Oallio admirers.
The proceedings, especially
towards midnight, were very
enthusiastic Throughout the
festivities, constant cries of
Vice P Alliance Pranco-
Russe!" were raised. This
incident is said to have placed
the immediate signature of the
Treaty between the Czab and
President Caknot beyond a
doubt.
Last evening a foreigner,
who by appearance would
have been taken for a Mus-
covite, was walking along
the asphalte, when he was
surrounded by a orowd of
persons orying "Vice la
Russie.'" The foreigner
seemed both surprised and

annoyed by these attentions,
and at length began to use his
fists and his boots liberally on
the ringleaders of the mob.
This treatment, however,
seemed only to increase their
Russophil ardour, and the
stranger was soon hoisted on
to the shoulders of some of his
foremost admirers, struggling
violently. On the arrival of a
gendarme, he explained that
he was an English book-maker,
and that "this bloomin' mob
of boot-lickers had taken him
for a bloomin' Russian!" The
crowd shortly afterwards dis-
persed. The completion of the
formal alliance between France
andRussia is considered less cer-
tain than it was a few days ago.
The Frenohman, M. Teie-
bois, who recently attempted
to walk on his head from Paris
to Moccow, in order to show
the sympathy felt in France
for the Muscovite Empire, did
not succeed in carrying out
his design. He was stopped
shortly after crossing the
Russian frontier, imprisoned,
and heavily ironed. After
suffering in this way for a
week, he was told that he
must leave Russian territory
within twenty-four hours, or
else continue his journey to
Siberia. On being appealed
to, the Czar graciously ex-
tended the time given for
quitting Russia to forty-
eight hours. This Imperial
clemency has caused the widest
feeling of gratitude and satis-
faction in France, and the
signature of the definitive Al-
liance between the two coun-
tries is confidently expected
at an exceedingly early date.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTBACTKD FROM THE DIAKY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday Night, June 8.—I knew Dike first
when (good many years ago now) as Dizzy's whip he hunted in oouple
with Rowland Winn; then always called Habt Dike. Like many
other young men he has in interval lost his Habt, and now known
as Sir William: Dyke. Curious thing, as Sark reminds me, how
absorbent is the name of William. Quite probable that before
Black-Eyed*Susan's friend came prominently on the stage he had
some other Christian name, sunk when he was promoted to shadow of
yard-arm. Certainly there is an equally eminent man sitting oppo-
site Dyke in House to-night, who like him is " Sir William" to
the present generation, and was Vernon Habcoubt to an elder one.
Dyke, under whatever name, done excellently well to-night.
Holding comparatively minor appointment in Ministry, suddenly
finds himself in charge of principal measure of Session. Handicapped,
moreover, with recollections of time when he has uncompromisingly
declared himself against the very principle he now embodies in Bill,
and'invites House to add to Statute Book.
That was first hedge for Dyke to take, and he went over in plucky
style that threw the soorner off his trail. Didn't live in close com-
munication with Dizzy through six long years for nothing. Not
likely to forget what happened in very earliest days of Parliament
of 1874, when Dizzy for first time found himself not only in offioe but
in power. During election campaign Dizzy, speaking in the safety of
Buckinghamshire, had made some wild statement about easing the
chains of Ireland. Simply designed to gain Irish vote; forgotten as
Boon as spoken. But Robebt Montagu—where, by the way, is
Robert Montagu P—treasured these things up in his heart, and when
Dizzy appeared in the House, Leader of triumphant majority, asked
him what he was going to do about it P
"It is sometime since the observations referred to were made,"
said Dizzy, "and—er-a good deal has happened in the interval."
Dyke, recalling and admitting his former statements on Free
Education, did not attempt to minimise their import. "But," he
said, button-holing House as it were, and treating it quite confiden-
tially, "the faot is we all change our minds." House laughed at
this as it had laughed at Dizzy seventeen years ago, ana Dyke,
absolved and encouraged, went forward with his speech.
Not a brilliant oration in any way; neither exordium nor per-
oration, and the middle occasionally a little mixed. But a good
sensible straightforward speech, and if Dyke had done no more than
show that an', important Ministerial measure oould be explained
within limit of an hour, he would not have lived in vain.
Business done.—Education Bill introduced.
Tuesday.—Nothing at first sight in personal appearance of Hebbebt
Thomas Knatchbull-Hugessen that suggests a swan. Fancy I have
heard something of these birds being addicted to the habit of breaking
forth into song when convinced of approaching dissolution. That, I
suppose, is how the swan was suggested to the mind when just now,
Enatchbull-Hugisben rose from behind Ministers, and began to
chant his threnody. Resolution on which Education Bill grafted
brought up for report stage; agreed to, and Habt Dyke about to
bring in his Bill. Then from the back seat rose a sturdy yeoman
figure, and a powerful voice was uplifted in denunciation of the Bill
and of a Ministry that had betrayed the trust of the Conservative
Party. It was, so the swan sang, a step on the road to Socialism. He
feared it had come to pass that dangerous measures are more likely
to emanate from the Treasury Bench than from the Front Bench
opposite.
Liberals roared with delighted laughter and cheers; the Con-
servatives sat glum and ill-at-ease. Old Morality's white teeth
gleamed with a spasmodic smile. As for Jokim he folded his arms,
and bit his lips and frowned.
"What antiquated nonsense this is I" he muttered, "of course
Free Education is not a Conservative principle. They all protested
against it at the General Election. A year earlier I, who happened
at the time to be numbered in the Liberal ranks, put my back

son; "wears well, but is politically; a
fossil. Now I'm a progressive
Conservative, which 1 think
you '11 find, Toby, my boy, to
be about the time of day."
Business done. — Assisted
Education Bill; firmly led up
to table by Hart Dyke.
Wednesday. — Lively fight
round Deceased "Wife's Sister
Bill. Ascot in vain held forth
its attractions; supporters of
the Bill hoped opponents would
go; opponents came down
rattier expecting Heneage's
virtue would have given way,
and Asoot would have claimed
him as its own. But every-
body there—Maitns's men with
long list of Amendments warranted to keep things going till half-
past five, when progress must be reported, and chance of Bill for
present Session lost. Makins himself in nigh oratorical feather.
Osbobne-ap-Mobgan, having made a proposition and subsequently
withdrawn it, Makins, putting on severest judicial aspect, observed,
"It is all verv well for the Right Hon. and learned Gentleman to
make a legal Jonah of himself and swallow his opinions."
"Bless us all!" cried Rowntbee, looking on with blank amaze-
ment, "Makins evidently thinks that Jonah swallowed the whale."
Bill seemed to shatter friendships and dis-
sever old alliances. Squire of Malwood
naturally at home in the fray, but rather
startling to find Home Secretary running
amuck at Chamberlain. Matthews in his
most hoity-toity mood; quivered with indig-
nation; thumped the table; shook a forensic
forefinger at the undesignedly offending Joseph,
and, generally, went on the rampage. As for
Heneagr, he filled up any
little pause in uproar by
diving in and moving the
Closure. Onoe, whilst
Gedge was opposing an
Amendment hostile to
Bill, Hen rage dashed in
with his Closure motion.
Gedge'a faoe a study;
mingled surprise, indig-
nation, and ineffable re-
gret mantled his mobile
front.
"To think." he said
afterwards, that just
when I was coming to
Heneage's help with an
argument founded on

"Bless u» all!"
profound study and pointed with legal lore, he should suddenly
jump up, lower his head, and, as it were, butt me in the stomach
with the Closure. It is more than I can at the moment com-
prehend."
Gedge so flurried that when Members returned, after Division on
Closure, he being, in accordance with the rule, seated and wearing his
hat, wanted to argue out the question with Courtney.
"I submit, Sir," he said, "that the Hon. Member, in moving the
Closure, controverted Rule 186."
The Chairman: "I think the Hon. Member can scarcely have read
the Rule."
Mr. Gedge: "I have read the Rule. Sir. This iB what it says—"
Chairman: "Order I Order!" and Gedge subsided.
Then Tomlinson fortuitously turning up on Treasury Bench, joined
in conversation. But Courtney turned upon him with suoh a
thunderous cry of "Oder! Order!" that Tomlinson visibly
shrivelled up, and his sentence, like the unfinished window in
Axladin's Tower, unfinished must remain.
Wrangling went on till a quarter past five, when Talbot inter-
posed, and with most funereal manner moved to report progress.
Heneage almost meohanioally lowered his head and had started to
butt at Talbot as he had upset Gedge when he was providentially
stopped and convinced that farther struggle with obstruction was
hopeless. So, Clause I. agreed to, Bill talked out. Makins, growing
increasingly delightful, protested that a Bill that had been fifty
years before the oountry, was not to be rushed through the House on
a Wednesday afternoon. Argal, the more familiar the House is
with the details of a measure, the more necessary is it to debate it.
Business done.—Marriage with a Deceased Wife's Sister. Banns
again objected to.
Saturday, 1*25 A m.—Land Bill just through report stage. Nothing
left now but Third Reading. "Well, Knox," said Windbag Sex-
ion, "that will be our last opportunity, and we must make the most
of it. In meantime I think we've done pretty well. I'm especially
pleased with you. You 're a boy of great promise. If anything
happened to me—a stray tack in the bench, or a pin maliciously
directed, and the wind-bag were to collapse—you d do capitally,
till I got it repaired."
Windbag Junior blushed. As Old Morality remarks, Ingenuous
youth delights in the Approbation of Seasoned Seniority.
Business done.—Ltnl at last—I mean Land Parohase Bill through
at last. ,

a crowd of lightseer* circulate*, enjoying the oratory with a
deiul'ory impartiality. The usual tilhouettt* of gesticulating
'speaker* appear like jerky clockwork figures above the throng.
A crowd of Socialitl* are "remembering Chicago" in a corner.
The chie f centre of attraction it a drag occupied by a Philan-
thropic Young-lady Chairwoman, her chaperon, tome leading
laundresses, one or two male sympathisers, and a couple of
reporter!. The Chairwoman conducts
the proceedings with the greatest pos-
sible tact and grace, but it slightly
hampered by the levity of a crowd
composed of factory-girlt, temi-imbe-
cile larrikins, and professional laun-
dresses, whote burning anxiety for
reform masks ittelf under a surface
frivolity. In the neighbourhood it a
lorry decorated with clean third, and
occupied by young watherwomen fired
by an enthusiasm which manifests it-
self in bursts of shrill cheering and
lively interchange of chaff with the
spectators. In the meantime, the busi-
ness of this particular platform pro-
ceeds somewhat as follows:—
The Chairwoman (with patient good-
humour). Now, I'm sure you'll all be as
quiet as you can while I . . . (Hubbub,
caused by a personal altercation between
two Women in the crowd, and shouts of
"Order.'") Because really my doctor has
ordered me not to speak in the open air at
all . . . (Here an ill-conditioned female,
taking offence for some inscrutable reason,
remarks loudly, "'Er doctor, indeed, she's
a beauty, she is — 'er and 'er doctor!"
More calls to order, and extreme indigna-
tion of the ill-conditioned female at being
informed that she is "no lady," and had
"better 'old 'er jaw "; ribald and utterly
meaningless jests by the larrikins.) Order,
please! (Imploringly.) I know you won't
make it harder for me than you can help.
(A young Lady in a very tali hat and feather
it heard demanding that the Oentleman in
front of her should remove hit " boxer," on ,,.,
pain of obliging her to remove it herself; 1 Te been anpd 'P°ke *»
the question it argued at length.) . . You rariyment
all know the purpose for which we have . . . (Here an enthusiastic
old Lady on the drag begin* to cheer aimlessly, and wave a scrubbing-
brush; the Laundreise* on the lorry join in.) Well, we're goina; to

Mrs. JiNXliaos, along with the toffs I I want to 'ear Mrs. J innings

Goffjn— who has had several years' practical experience of laundry-
work, and she will tell you, I am sure, what the hardships and
injustices are which we are trying to put an end to.
[Mrs. Goffdi, a stout, red-faced Lady, mounts the seat with a cheery
confidence, amidst roars of laughter, and shout* of " Qo it, aid
pirl!" "Don't forgit to tend my shirt home next week!" 8,-c,
&-c. The female in the crowd repeats her preference for Mrs.
JlHNIKOS' oratory; a tiring of factory -girls, in high-feathered huts,
having just elbowed their way into the throng, suddenly conceive a
desire to "get a breath o' air somewhere," and accordingly push
and trample their way out again with a Parthian discharge
of refined raillery—after which Mrs. Coffin's voice becomes
audible.

SUMMERY MUMMERY.
I no not know how long the Summer Season at Terry's, now being
carried on by Mr. George Ed ward is, is to last, but with a little
dexterous management there is no reason why this excellent form of
entertainment should not go on all the year round. At 8 there is
The Lancashire Sailor, by Brandon Thomas, whioh I didn't see;
but have heard a first-rate report of it from those who have, and who
"know." It might occasionally change places with A Commission.
However, this is bat a suggestion, as both the pieces I saw the other
night will bear a second visit.
A Commisiim is a shoit one-act piece, with a sufficiently good
plot, and every part in it a character, except "Parker, the Maid"
—and here let me enter a solemn protest against the further use of
"Pakkkk" as the name of a lady's-maid in faroe or comedy.
Parker is played out. Let her be unit id to " Charles, his Friend,"
and let both enjoy their well-earned retirement from the stage.
Miss Lilt Hanburt plays "Mrs. Hemmersley, a rich young
widow," which cannot be described aa "a poor part." With this
Lilt, who looks rioh and is beautiful, the poor artist—a very poor
artist—one Marshall (without a Christian name in the bill, so why
not Snelgrovt Marshall t) well played by Dr. Forbes Dawson, fall*
desperately in love. Wkkdon Grow-mith is very good as the servant
—almost better as the servant than as the author of the piece, and
that's saying a good deal.
The Pantomime Rehearsal it eminently funny; especially the first
scene between the four men, Messrs. Elliot, Dankmore, Grossmith,
and Brandon Thomas. As for the last-mentioned, it is well worth
a visit to this theatre to see Mr. Brandon Thomas in two pieces, first
as the Model, and then as the Heavy Swell. It is a strong thing to say,
bat I can oall to mind no actor on the stage at the present moment
who oould in two different characters on the same night so completely
and absolutely lose his identity,—for voioe, manner, action, and of
course appearance are all utterly changed,—as does Mr. Brahdon
Thomas as Gloucetttr the Model, and as Captain Tom JUbinsnn.
All the ladies are good. Miss Helena Dacre looks magnificent.
Then Miss Edith Chester combines prettiness with fun, and the
duet between her and olever Miss Laura Linden is enthusiastically
encored— and deservedly so, for it is seldom that two young aotrtsses
will "go in" for a real genuine bit of nonsensical burlesque, and
win. In fact it is all good, " and if our friends in front" will accept
my tip, they will not find a more "summery" form of entertain-
ment than at Mr. Edwardes' Terry's Theatre.

"Did I mention a name r" inquired the Queen, somewhat
puzzled.

CURIOSITIES.
[If the following hare been

any visitor to Eton is en-
titled to call on the ProTOst,

and ask for an explanation.]
1. "7'm Monarch of

copy of ballad sung by the
First Eton Ten-oar.
2. Old Sketch (land-
scape) of the Very Cross

Also portrait of Suhi.t
Hall himself.
3. A Night on the
Brocas." Old poem, sup-
posed to be the original
of the soene "on the
Brooken" in Fautt. A
curious mistake of
Goethk's, probably due to
his not having been edu-
cated at Eton.
4. The original
"funny " owned by Master
Jostni Miller, supposed
to have provided him with
the notion for his first jest.
*. * Also the original jest
itself, bottled in high
spirits, and in a fair state
ot preservation. As clearly
as cm be deciphered, the
legend is something about
"an Indian," "an oars-
man," and "feathering a
scull," or "skull."

text that "The weak-
est goes to the Wall,"

discovered.]

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

Brother Dick.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OP TOBT, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, June 15.—Richard Chamberlain
back to-night, after long absence. Been up the Nile, calling on
Ptolemy and Pharaoh, and visiting soenes connected with the early
life of Brother Joseph. Much enjoyed the trip; entered House
to-night full of life and energy j suddenly pulled up; hair
flesh crept: blood chilled. Was it true? Could
it be possible? Yes; no doubt about it. There
was Prince Arthur still lounging ou Treasury
Benoh with Madden in reserve. About a score
of Members present, including Windbag Sexton,
looking on with his irritating smile of supreme
superiority, whilst Sage of Queen Annes Gate
moved rejection of Irish Land Purohase Bill.
"Why 1" exolaimed Brother Dick, his hair
still visibly rising, "when I was here last, weeks
and months ago, they were discussing Irish Land
Bill; Prince Arthur sprawled on Treasury Bench;
Labbt was denouncing the Bill as pernicious; and
Sexton, having just sat down and just going to
follow, looked on with sort of pitying toleration
of other people who assumed to know anything of
the Bill. Do 1 dream, or are there visions about?
Think I '11 go and pinch Jesse Colltnqs, and see
if I'm awake."
Yes; wide awake; no mistake about the situa-
tion; still harping on the Irish Land Bill; but,
thank a merciful Providence, this is the last night.
John Morley, who never shrinks from call of
duty, rises, and makes one of those formal, official,
somewhat tiresome protests, recapitulating ob-
jections whioh everyone only too familiar with
through this gruesome spring and saddened sum-
mer. Then Sage of Queen Anne's Gate cracks
a few jokes; Morton appears on scene; attempt
made to Count Oat; talk kept going through
dinner hour. At eleven o'clock Prince Arthur
rises; benohes fill up; then, when everyone ready
for Division, strangers in Gallery startled by mighty roar of execra-
tion; looking round with startled gaze in search of explanation,
discover at corner-seat below Gangway a dapper figure uplifted, on
supernaturally high-heeled boots, with trousers tightly drawn to
display proportions of limbs that would have made Sim Tappertit
green with envy; a black frock coat, buff waistcoat, coloured tie,
a high collar, a wizened countenance, just now wrinkled with
spasmodic contortion, kindly meant for an ingratiating smile.
This is Seymour Eeat. House may roar at him as the dog that
crosses the Epsom Course when the bell rings for the Derby is howled
at. He has, in return for the contumely, only a smile, a deprecatory
wave of the hand and a speech. House keeps up the roar; Kbay
waves his ringed hand, nods pleasantly at the Speaker, and at any-
thing approaching a lull, shouts half a sentence at top of his voice.
For full ten minutes contest continued. Then Speaker rises; Keat
sits down, glad of interval of rest, and hopeful that Speaker is about
to rebuke his interrupters.
"The question is, said the Speaker, "that this Bill be now read
a Third Time." Before Kbay realised situation, House is oleared for
Division, and his final speech on Land Purchase Bill remains unspoken.
Business done.—Irish Land Bill read a Third Time by 225 votes
against 96. ■ •»'.' . • • -
Tuesday.—Gorst gave House to-night thorough surprise. The
Squire of Malwood brought on Manipur business; moved Resolution
asking for more papers. Incidentally indicted the Government at
home and in India. Gorst put up to reply. An average Minister
would have made an ordinary speech; Gorst's reply accepted by
common consent as the most extraordinary ever heard from the
Treasury Benoh since Dizzy left it. Instead of evading respon-
sibilities, colouring faots, doing what Ministers usually do when in a
fix, Gorst simply, boldly, cynically, told the truth. The Senapatti
of Manipur was an ambitious, capable, popular man who might breed
mischief for the rule of the Empress of India. So the Senapatti
must be got rid of at earliest possible moment, and in most absolutely
complete fashion. Arbitrary this; tyrannical perhaps; unjust
possibly. None of Gorst's business to defend or extenuate it. All
he could say was it is not a new thing; done wherever British flag
waves under foreign skies; in New Zealand with the Maori King; in
South Africa with Cetewayo; in Egypt with Arabi; in the Soudan
with Zkbehr "In India," said Gorst, leaning bis elbow lightly on
the table, "they have always hated and discouraged independent
and original talent; always loved and promoted mediocrity.''
As he finished this pregnant and delightful aphorism. Gorst
looked up at the Peers' Gallery, where sat his Chief, Grand Cross.
successor of Clive in the Government of India. His glance travelled
downward, till it rested on the Treasury Benoh, and fell gently on
the figure of Old Morality.
How Dizzy would have delighted in this speech, with this last
exquisite touch! The Squire of Malwood, in his secret breast, not
less appreciative; but debate must be kept up, and he joined in the
hue and cry with whioh Mediocrity resented this fresh and original
way of treating things. Even Campbell-Bannerman shook his
head. "It is brilliant," he said, "but it is not discretion."
Business done.—A. good deal.
Thursday.—Government met with awkward defeat on Faotories
Bill. Not quite certain to whom they chiefly owe it, whether to
Qorst or Matthews. Question arose on Sydney Buxton's Amend-
ment, raising the age of child-labourers to a minimum of eleven
years. Debate lasted all night; a pleasant contrast to the unreality
of Irish Debate; Benohes crowded; audience interested; speeches
practical; Gorst in attendance, though doubtful whether he would
speak. Usually sits in modest retirement under shadow of Speaker's
Chair. To-night marked slight difference of opinion from his
colleagues by taking up corner- seat on Treasury Benoh by Gangway,
quite out of reach of hand-shake from Home Secretary.
Mundella, longing to be at Matthews, waiting on Front
Opposition Benoh; Matthews, earnestly desiring collision with
Mundella, lingered the long night through on Treasury Bench. At
last dragged into arena by John Morley. Painfully conscious of
Gorst on his right hand. Why couldn't he go away? Why ait
there smiling when Matthews floundered, and why turn over the
pages of the Blue Book with such subtle air of contradiction when
Matthews quoted from proceedings of Berlin Conference f
As midnight drew on, ex-
citement inoreased. Uncer-
tain how Division would go.
Rumours of possible defeat
of the Government; Akbrs-
Douglas moving about smil-
ing; therefore all must be
well. House surging with
exoitement; movement to and
fro; a buzz of conversation
rising above the voioe of
Member addressing the Chair.
Only one placid figure under
the glass roof. Seated in side
Gallery facing Treasury Benoh
was J. S. Balfour; (no rela-
tion of Prince Arthur's, bten
entendu) Question put; Di-
vision bell rang; the bustle
of eight hundred departing
feet disturbed J. S. B., and,
stepping carefully down from
the inconveniently high Bench
he walked out to take part in
the Division.
"All very well, dear Toby,"
he said, "talking about eleven
being the age for half-timers. N° Delation of Prince Arthur's.
Eleven seems to me about the figure at whioh we should knock off
here. When it gets on to twelve in this hot weather, I almost feel
as if I could go to sleep." Butiness done.— Sydney Buxton's
Amendment to Faotories Bill carried by 202 Votes against 186.
Friday.—Question to-night, how would Government take their
defeat of yesterday? Soon settled; at earliest moment Matthews
appeared at table, announced that Government "fully and cordi-
ally " accepted deoision of House. It was true that they had resisted,
with fullest strength, Sydney Buxton's proposal. He himself, in
powerful speech, had demonstrated that, if Amendment were added
to the Bill, the heavens would fall, and the British Empire would
stagger to its doom. But that only his play; Gorst really obliged
to the House for beating them, ana Clause would be added to Bill.
Done accordingly. Report stage of Factories' Bill run through, and
Third Reading taken.
Odd thing befell the universe last" week. Happening to mention
in this Diary Wooton Isaacson, Member for Tower Hamlets, the
dissolute Artist drew fancy portrait of Lewis Isaacs, Member for
Newington; labelled it from Dod, "A Progressive Conservative."
Oddly enough, both Isaacs and Isaacson write themselves down in
Dod "A Progressive Conservative." So our Artist (occasionally
quite olear-headed), got mixed up with the family; descended, bo to
► peak, from Isaac to Isaac's son. Notquite sure "to which apology is
due. Just as well to mention it, so that, when the New Zealander
reads his Punch a century or two hence, he may have a clear con-
ception of the actuality. Business done.—Quite a lot
More Russian Tyranny.—Punch is not admitted into
unless bound.

Shodkin.
This Hebrew middle-man dis-
parage,
To whom religion grants a fee,
Paid by both sides, for making
marriage?
Nay, Jew, we thank thee for the
word,
For Fate two Jews might haply
sever;
The busy Shodkin comes as third,
And swiftly makes them one
for ever.
AN OPERATIC PUZZLE.
I had been informed that it was no use buying a book of Mireille,
as those sold in the honse were of a somewhat light and mis-leading
character. So I didn't. Bat I had a programme, and fortunately I
was able to recognise most of the singers in spite of their disguise.
Also I comforted myself with the offioial information that the piece
was to be performed, "by desire, in French." "Oho!" says I, to
myself, "there is some sensible person on the Committee who doesn't
understand Italian, and prefers' French as she is sung.'" However,
I recognised but one of the Covent Garden Committee men present,
and he was there only in a casual sort of way. Dbubiolanus wasn't
en ividence; probably at home rehearsing various effects with a view
to receiving the Imperial Majesty of Germany. These receptions,
including such a getting up (and down) stairs," walking with crab-
like aotion, require a lot of rehearsal, not to mention the manage-
ment of a sword which is apt to be dangerous only to the wearer, and
the carrying of'wax-lights, the tffeot of which on his offioial Court
dress may reoall to the mind of the Operatic Manager the celebrated
name of G uisr. There was no one in authority to tell me anything
about Mireille, and this is what I made out of the plot.
Mireille, Miss Eaves, charming throughout, is a happy peasant
in beautiful little patent leather shoes, which, I hope, are as easy as
apparently are her circum-
stances. She is beloved by
one Vincent, pronounced Van
Song, a peasant of a rather
Whitechapelish - eostermon -
gerish-out-on-a-Sunday ap-
pearance, but picturesque
withal. They are engaged;
at least, if they are not they
ought to be. Then comes a
handsome elderly lady, dis-
guised like a fairy godmother
in a pantomime before she
throws off her hood and an-
nounces her real character, and
this lady, called Taven in the
bill, is Mile. Passama, who
sings a song about a papillon,
for what particular reason I do
not know, exoept to please the
audience, which it aid, being
enoored, and to puzzle Mireille,
in which it also succeeded, if I
might judge by Miss Eahbs's
expressive countenance. And
here I must observe that I
found my intimate acquaint-
ance with the French language
almost useless, for exoept an
occasional "out," given, as
Jeames has it, "in excellent
'le papillon" just mentioned,
et alvrs"—which didn't help me much, even when given
cost dramatically by M. Isnabdon,—I couldn't catch a single
word, and as far as libretto went, it might have been, for me per-
sonally, given in double-Dutoh, or the dialect of a South-African tribe.
On the disappearance of Taven,—[she didn't take off her oloak,
and wasn't a fairy, which rather put me off the soent, I admit,]—in
a gorgeous person, six feet nigh at least, and stout in propor-

tion, who, as I gathered from the programme, was Ourrias (what a
name 1), played by Signor Cisif, and sung with a kind of double
vibrato stop in bis organ, which seemed, when turned on full, to
make the upper boxes quiver. Well, in he comes, and tells
Mireille something—what, I don't know—bat this is how the row
began, as, in less than five minutes, two old men, one M. Isnahdon,
dramatio and in tune, and the other, not mentioned in my pro-
gramme, and therefore pardonably somewhat oat of tune, enter and
commence a rumpus; what the difficulty was all about I am not
clear, but the upshot was that the old man in tone cursed his
daughter, and the old man out of tune held back his son Vincknt,
and prevented him from first assaulting and then being assaulted
by the irate Maxtre Ramon, i.e., M. Isnahdon. The Chorus of
Unhappy Villagers forms tableau. End of Act the Second; in Aot
the First there was no aotion at all, and everything had gone off as
pleasantly as possible.
Then, in Aot III., there is a sandy desert—where ?—Egypt F
—Heaven, Augustus Harris, and the scene-
painter, only know—and here oomes on a
mighty illigant shepherd with a pipe—to play,
not to smoke—and one olever person near me
was sure it was Miss Eambs in dis-
guise, but it turned out to be Miss
Htoi>-a Pinkkkt, a piper of whom
some present would willingly have
paid to hear a little more; bat she
vanished, probably in search of her
flock in the desert,—by the way, an
excellent place for golf this desert,
—and then in came Mireille and
Taven, when the latter, I fancy,
tells Mireille of the crime she has
witnessed in the previous scene,
which, I !regret to say, I have
omitted to mention from motives of
delicacy. But alas I I can no longer
conceal the faot. In that previous
scene Mr. Ourrias had behaved
very badly in first losing his tem-
per, and then sticking a dagger into
poor Vincent Lubert, who fell down
behind a rook, presumably dead.
The golf-ground is cleared off, and
we are baok again in front of the village churoh. But at this
moment a person, who knew all about it, whispered, " If you want
to get your cab, and escape the crush, now's the time, as the Opera
is just over." So I hurried off, and to this moment I haven't the
faintest idea how it all ended, and I don't quite understand how it
began. However, I have recorded my impressions, confused probably,
but—the music is very pretty, and Miss Eaves very charming.
PARENTAL AUTHORITY.
Typical British Father (according to the Home Secretary). Now,
come, Jane and Jim, bundle up to your work. Look sharp!
Government Inspector. No, Mr. Sikes, I think not. Your
youngsters have not touched eleven yet.
Typical British Father. But they're over ten.
Government Inspector. That don't matter. The age is altered.
You'11 just send your young kids back to the Board School again.
Typical British Father. Well, I call it downright robbery. Why,
they supports me, they do; and what more fitter work can you find
for the kids, but to support their parients with the sweat of their
brow. Why, I thought the 'Omk Secretary was all on our side.
Government Inspector. Well, he's been beat, that's all. The
oountry don't see the fun of sending children of tender years away
from their proper training, to wear out their young bodies and poison
their young systems in beastly olose, ill-ventilated work-rooms, and
all just to bring in an extra bit of money to enable their parents,
like yon, to laze and loaf at home, and, maybe, spend their hardly-
earned wage on drink. However, you'll have to dock it, Mr. Sixes.
Typical British Father. Well, I call it downright bloomin' rob-
bery. It's more. It's a invasion of the sacred rights of the British
working man's domestio home. It's a infringement of the liberty of
the subject, that's wot it is. It's a teaching the young 'una
rebellion against their natural protectors. It's a bloomin' shame!

says Mr. Jakes Path in the Illustrated London News, "always 'to

Quai>", the latter will beam on him, and tell him a good story. The

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The Baron is getting along with George Meredith's One of Our
Conquerors. Within the last three weeks he has already reached
p. 94 of Vol. L, and here the weather, having suddenly become
tropical, the Baron felt that his mighty brain " whirled, swam to a
giddiness, and subsided." He has been stopped occasionally en
route; he had oome into view of " the diminutive marble cavalier of
the infantile cerebel-
lum." Then he re-
traced his steps, puz-
zled a bit, but after a
"modest quencher"
Swivellerian libation,
he hit upon a lumi-
nous passage whioh
warned him " in plain
speech''— and w hose
is plainer than George
Merkdith'sP—" that
the Bacchus of aus-
picious birth induces
ever to the worship of
the loftier Deities."
Excellent i' faith 1
And then the Baron
mole, as one who is
interiorly enlightened
umileth as he read,
"Forbear to come
hauling up examples
of malarious men "—
(•'' malarious men' is
Sood," quoth the
iaron)—"in whom
these pourings of the
golden rays of life
treed fogs; and be
moved, since you are
scarcely under an obli-
gation to hunt the

Baron wondered
within himself. Was
he under an obligation
or not Y In foro con-
sciential the case was
set down for that im-
mortal date, "To-
morrow")— in toler-
ance of some dithy-
rambic inebriety of
narration (quiverings of the reverent pen) when we find ourselves
entering the circle of a most magnetic popularity." Here the Baron
paused. Somehow, in his search after truth, he had fallen down
some seventy pages, and was on his back again at p. 33, Vol. I.
Refreshment was necessary. Iced. Also a Nicotinian sacrifice, as
of primitive days, when heifers adorned, not altars, but weeds,
vegetables, and early produoe only. Smokeamus! Veni, vidi, visky!

Question. But should this lead to bankruptcy, what then?
Witness. Bankruptcy should be legally abolished.
Question. Should employers have no money to pay the employed Y
Witness. That duty should be discharged by the Government.
Question. But how should the loss be supplied—by the imposition
of new taxes?
Witness. Certainly not. Taxation should be entirely abolished.

discretion of the Government.
