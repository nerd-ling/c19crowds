was the eve of the New Year, the Year of Grace 1892, and Mr. Punch, musing de-ply upon the manifold duties opening
upon him with his opening Volume, nodded over his cigar, drowsed, and dreamed a dream of the Old Days and of the Now,
" in visionary vagueness strangely blent.” The substance of that suggestive Vision he thus dra'natically sets forth :-
SCENE-Eastcheap. A Room in the Boar's Head Tavern. Enter Prince ALBERT EDWARD and Mr. PUNCH.
Prince. After you, Mr. Punch!
Punch. Though you be but Prince of Wales, yet are you the King of Courtesy !
Prince. Well quoted, i' faith! Verily this shadowy precinct smacks of antiquity, and suggesteth Shakspearian tags.
Punch. To a Prince of Wales, and his fidus Achates--naturally!
Prince. Yet art thou no Porns !
Punch. No more than thou art a madcap Prince Hal.
Prince. Thou art perfect! The brain of this foolish-compounded clay, Man, is not able to invent anything that tends
to laughter more than thou inventest. “At the old place, my Lord, in Eastcheap." How real it seems ! Mahatmas could
not outdo this, though they re-incarnated in all his tun of flesh the Fat Knight of SHAKspeare's virile fancy. One fancies
one can hear the shout for “ FrancIS !” the drawer's cry of " Anon, anon, Sir !” the shrill addition of the irate treble of
Dame QUICKLY, and the stertorous snore of Sir John Sack-and-Sugar from behind yon faded phantom arras!
Punch. Would we could, would we could! I am of all humours that have show'd themselves humours, since the old
days of goodman Adam to the pupil age of this present twelve o'clock at midnight; but, by my faith, the humour of the frolic
Fat Knight -- Prince. Hist! What is't that fetches breath so hard ?
Enter Shade of FALSTAFF from behind the Arras.
Punch. Welcome, Jack. Where hast thou been ?
Falstaff. A plague on all spooks! say I. Give me a cup of sack, an ye love me. Is there no hospitality extant ?
Punch. Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and drink it?
Falstaff. Ah, ar't there? What doth Gravity out of his bei at midnight?
Punch. Looking for Levity, who, at holier hours, may hardly be encountered within the precincts of Cockcrowdom.
Falstaff. Fairly answered, i' faith. Well, if sack and sugar be a fault, God help the wicked : If to be old ani merry
he a sin, then thou, Punce, art but a latter-day plump Jack thyself.
Prince. Bating the grossness, and retaining the humour without the humours, thy comparison is not so wholly unapt,
Sir Joun.

Falstaff. Sweet Prince, I kiss thy neif! Body o' me how are times changed, and Princes with the times, and
Prince's Companions with Princes. No marvel i' faith, that heirs-apparent are so improved, when such a Momus and Mentor

truly, but little better than one of the wicked. A Lord of the Council of your day,—of the County Council to wit, —would
indeed rate me roundly, had he the chance, a McDougall having little more understanding of wild wit than a Shallow of
civic wisdom. Howbeit I can appreciate a Prince-a true Prince and a dutiful withal—who layeth foundation-stones in lieu
of plots with Porns, who openeth exhibitions instead of bottles. Yet would I fain bibe to thy Jubilee-together with that
of Mr. Punch which it so closely follows-in a cup of that same rememberable sack, my Prince !
Prince. Fifty years or so of ceremonials, Falstaff! Trust me, I am sometimes exceedingly weary, a little out of
love with my greatness, and inclined, amidst the sparkle of champagne and-and, loyal addresses, &c., to remember, like my
predecessor, the poor creature, small beer!
Falstaff Why, that's my Prince! What say'st, Mr. Punch, smacks not that avowal of a larger humanity and, a
freer humour than courtiers and County Councillors can compass? Whence hath he it, this Horatian heartiness, this
Terentian catholicity ?
Punch. Partly from the kindly dower of Mother Nature, partly also from the humorous humanities of that same
Momus-Mentor of whom you spake erewhile, Sir John, though I say it who
Prince. -Has the best right to. He hath a good wit, Sir John, not-as thou saidst of Poins's—as thick as
Tewksbary mustard. That's why the Prince doth love him so ! That, Sirrah, is the humour the Prioce is of !
Falstaff. Very singular good! I would fain share his wit, his conceit, with thee, Prince, as Madcap Hal did mine
of old.
Punch. And shall, Sir John, an it please thee. I have devised matter enough out of this half-year's doings, to keep
Prince Hal—and thee—in continual laughter the wearing out of six passions, and ye shall laugh without intervallums. Oh,
you shall laugh till your face be like a wet cloak ill laid up!
Falstaff. Despatch then, I prithee, Punch, for, by this chill, cock-crow approacheth, and I must unwillingly hence,
from well-loved ancient haunt, and well-liked new company !
Punch. First then a Jubilee Health, and Long Life to our Visible Prince, to his Pearl of Princesses, to his happily-
recovered younger son, and—with three times three—to his newly-betrothed elder one, and his English Merry Max!!!
Falstaff. "The heavens thee guard and keep, most Royal imp of fame! God save thee, my sweet boy! My king, my
love! I drink to thee, my heart !"
Prince. Best thanks to ye both !

MR. PUNCH EXPLAINS.
[Last week Mr. Punch congratulated King Henry's "holy
shade” on the Four-hundredth Anniversary of the Foundation
of Eton College.]
To Mr. Punch's friends, who think he blundered,
In thinking Eton's years were just four hundred,
And acted quite in error when he paid
Congratulations to King HENRY's shade,"
A word of explanation now is due,
To show how what he stated then was true.
The word is this—that fifty years have now
Elapsed since Mr. Punch first made his bow ;
And though since then with many friends he's parted,
Himself he is as young as when he started.
Just fifty years ago it now appears
That fair Etona claimed four hundred years.
Ungallant it had been if one had told her
That Mr. Punch kept young whilst she grew older!
Yet if it is indeed the Fourth Centenary
Or Jubilee the Ninth since holy 'ENERY

I have been more and more struck by the extraordinary intelligent

judgment is sound, and his eloquence is of so high an order as to
ensure to him a brilliant success in the House he is destined to
adorn. But what chiefly commends him to my regard and to yours,
is the honourable uprightness of his character. The contest here
will be a fierce and determined one; but, thark heaven, with such
a Candidate as yours, it will be kept free from all personal bitter-
ness, and will be conducted in such a way that no breath of
suspicion will rest on the absolute and scrupulous legality of every-
thing that may be done. The conscience of the people demands this

A BALLADE OF EVENING NEWSPAPERS.
The evening shadows gather round the room ;
How full of joy it were to sit and greet
The twilight slowly deepening into gloom,
And in the cool forget the noontide heat.
The busy hum, the noise of passing feet,
Such quiet calm could scarcely serve to mar,
Did there not come to us from out the street,
Globe, Erening News, Pall Mall, St. James's, Star !
The gaily-coloured omnibuses loom,
Approach, and disappear with footsteps fleet,
The crossing-sweepers blithely ply the broom,
Policemen slowly pace upon their beat.
We buy the blossoms with their fragrance sweet,
And only on our senses sadly jar
The noises of the ruffians who repeat,
Globe, Evening News, Pall Mall, St. James's, Star!
The latest aspect of the latest boom,
The starting price of winners and of wheat,
The thousand lives lost in a late simoom,

A NEW ELECTION “LAY.”
OH, young Mrs. BRAND has gone down to the East !
To give the Electors a musical feast,
And save her fine treble she weapons has none;
Yet she means with that voice that the seat shall be won.
So good at a lay, at a ballad so grand,
There never was dame like the young Mrs. BRAND!
All boldly she's entered the Cambridgeshire halls,
'Mid the squires, and the parsons, the farmers, and thralls!
Said Duncan, the foeman, “My friends, on my word,
Of a stranger proceeding I never have heard.
I don't wish to be rude, but I can't understand
What you mean by this singing, oh young Mrs. BRAND!”
“You need not suspect me,” the lady replied ;
"I care not how flows the electoral tide,
I merely have come down to Wisbech to-day
To sing a few stanzas, trill one little lay.
I am tired of long speeches, Home-Rule I can't stand,
But I do enjoy singing "-quoth young Mrs. BRAND,
So lovely her voice, so bewitching her grace,
Such a treat-or such treating-did never take place.
While the Primrose Dames fretted, the Unionists fumed,
She merely the thread of her roundel resumed ;
And the Duncanites whispered—“'Tis most underhand!
We must send for a song stress to match Mrs. BRAND.”
A change in her theme! She has altered the bar
To Kathleen Marourneen, and Erin-go-bragh!
Spell-bound stand the rustics; she's won the whole throng!
To the lady they've given their votes for a song:
"'Twill be ours, will the seat—'tis the plot I have planned!
Oh, Music hath charms!”-exclaimed young Mrs. BRAND.
There is mourning mid folk of the Wire-pulling Clan;
Agents, Managers, Chairmen, are wild to a man,
For the Cambridgeshire precedent means that their calling

A NEW LEADER.
(“. At present the followers are obliged to be amiable because
the Leader is amiable. Under the Leader I suggest they would
be less amiable, and would be at liberty to say stronger things.”

Chorus of Amiable Tories.
HEAR! hear! Mr. A. We are amiable too,
For we follow our amiable Leader, like you ;
But when forced to say, Bless you!" we choke with our
spleen,
And we add, sotto voce, “You know what I mean.”
While we sit spick and span as a picture by FRITH,
And contend with our feelings, to please Mr. SMITH.
Oh, we pule and we prate, we are nerveless and weak,
And we swallow, like Pistol, the odorous leek.
We palter with truth, and we tlatter our foes,
And we cringe, and we crawl, and are led by the nose.
We are fools soft of speech, and without any pith,
For we smother our feelings to suit Mr. Smith.

Might detest him aloud and declare what he felt.
He might use the crisp words which, if lacking in length,
Make up for their shortness by meaning and strength.
But now we all fawn on the Celt and his kith,
While we smother our feelings to suit Mr. SMITH.
So, friends, we must choose a new Leader, and then,
With a Man at our head we shall quit us like men:
We shall always retort with a sting when we're stung,
With the bees in our bonnet, the D's on our tongue.
And the words that are honeyed shall fade like a myth,

THE WRONG OF SEARCH.
(A Dream of the British Inquisition.)
THE unfortunate foreigner, travel-stained and suffering from the
after-glow of a stormy passage, crawled up the gangway and was
once more on land. He carried in his hand a portmanteau.
"Have you anything to declare?” asked an official, in a gold-
peaked cap and blue frock coat, gruffly.
Only that your seas are terrible," was the reply,
The official made no answer, but merely pointed to some planks
that had been placed upon trestles. The foreigner glanced at the
people who were standing in front of these planks, and noticed that
they
were pale with apprehension.
Have you anyth ng to declare ?" was a second time uttered-
now by a person less gold-laced. Then the official continued,
“Here, open it!”
In a moment the portmanteau was thrown with force on the planks,
and the foreigner protested.
“I understand you now. I have no cigars—I do not smoke. I
have no spirits-I am what you call a teatotaller. I have no lace-I
am a widower.”
Open it!” was once more the cry—this time with great
vehemence.
“But I am innocent of concealing anything! Believe me, there is
nothing to declare! I have some photographic plates-to open them
is ruin! I prize my shirts-they are heirlooms - if they are roughly
handled I can never wear them again." And the foreigner wrung
his hands in his despair.
“If you will not open it,” replied the official, unmoved by his
eloquent appeal, “we shall detain your luggage."
"But this is barbarous-cruel,"continued the foreigner, answer-
ing with excitement. “I have been to Constantinople with its

discussing the Treaty that has
now been in force for some
years.
Kaiser (with assumed cheer-

Brothers, it is really time you
should do something. It is not
on my own account that I am
anxious, but on yours-purely
ours.
King (dryly). Certainly !

Well, my dear friend, as I am
afraid we are on the eve of a
contest with France, I must beg
of you to place three Army
Corps upon your Alpine
frontiers.
King (with assumed surprise).
Why should I do this? It will
be most inconvenient!

the provisions of the Treaty.
Emperor (interposing). Your
pardon, that stipulation was
suppressed at King HUMBERT'S
request.
Kaiser (annoyed). Oh, was

you will be so good (as my re-

Russian frontier beyond Cracow.

astonishment). Why should I
do this? It will be most in-

AN 'UMBLE CORRECTION.
IN “The New Yachting," a discursive paper, pleasantly written by
Sir MORELL MACKENZIE, M.D., in The Fortnightly for this month,
the author quotes a verse from the old song of Jim Collins,” or,
as he writes it, “John Collins" (by way of proving that the drink
known by that name was originated by this individual), but quotes
it, to the best of our knowledge and belief, inaccurately. It was set
to the air of “Jenny Jones," and thus it ran :

“ And my hokkipashun
Ead-vaiter at Limmers',

This, we venture to assert, savours more of the old bar and the
ancient sanded floors, more of the by-gone Cider Cellars and extinct
Vauxhall Gardens, more of the early mornings and late nights, more
of the rough-and-ready.“P. R.” times, than the veneered version

FAR CHARLIE, - It's 'ot, and no error! Summer on us, at last, with a bust;
Ninety odd in the shade as I write, I've a 'ed, and a thunderin' thust.
Can't go on the trot at this tempryture, though I'm on 'oliday still ;
So I'lſ pull out my eskrytor, CHARLIE, and give you a touch of my quill.
If you find as my fist runs to size, set it down to that quill, dear old pal;
Correspondents is on to me lately, complains as I write like a gal,
Sixteen words to the page, and slopscrawly, all dashes and blobs. Well,
it's true;
But a quill and big sprawl is the fashion, so wot is a feller to do?
Didn't spot you at 'Enley, old oyster–I did 'ope you'd shove in your oar.
We 'ad a rare barney, I tell you, although a bit spiled by the pour,
'Ad a invite to 'OPKINS's 'Ouse-boat, prime pitch, and swell party, yer know,
Pooty girls, first-class lotion, and music. I tell yer we did let things go.
Who sez 'Enley ain't up to old form, that Society gives it the slip?
Wish you could ’ave seen us—and heard us-old boy, when aboard of our ship.
Peonies and poppies ain't in it for colour with our little lot,
And with larfter and banjos permiskus we managed to mix it up 'ot.

Bosh! CHARLIE, extreme Tommy rot! It's these sniffers as want to spile sport.
Want things all to theirselves, these old jossers, and all on the strictest Q. T.
Their idea of the Thames being “spiled” by the smallest suggestion of spree,
Wy it's right down rediklus, old pal, gives a feller the ditherums, it do.
I mean going for them a rare bat, and I'm game to wire in till all's blue.
Who are they, these stuckuppy snipsters, as jaw about quiet and peace,
Who would silence the gay constant-screamer" and line the Thames_banks with

Who sneer about “'ARRY at 'Enley," and sniff about "cads on the course,”

TWO EMPERORS;
Or, the Christian Crar and The Heathen Chinee.
[A decree issued by the Emperor of CAINA (in
connection with the recent anti-foreign agitation
in that country) points out that the relations be-
tween the Chinese and the foreign missionaries have
been those of peace and goodwill, and that the
Christians are protected by treaty and by Imperial
edicts, and commands the Governors and Lieu-
tenant-Governors to protect the Christians and
put down the leaders in the riots.}
Many writers remark,-

That for cruelty dark,
And for jealousy vain,

NEPTUNE'S "AT HOME;" OR, NEICHBOURS UNITED.
THE French are all coming, for so they declare,
Of their fleet and their tars all the papers advise us;
They ’re to come o'er the sea and to Portsmouth repair,
Their squadrons at Spithead will please, not surprise us.
Their fleet is to come for a right friendly spree;
To promise them“ skylarks” is hardly presumption.
They're welcome to NEPTUNE's old “ Halls by the Sea.”
Of powder and grog there'll be mighty consumption,
In toasts and salutes, for they ’re friends and invited:
John and JOHNNY clasp paws,
And drink deep to the Cause
Of NEPTUNE's two guests and brave Neighbours United!
The scribes and the specials report wondrous things,
Of the grand preparations, the routs and the rackets.
Gone the old days of huge wooden walls and white wings,
We now meet without mutual dusting of jackets.
Well so much the better! Our seas let them try,
Their squadrons are welcome to float 'em and swim 'em.
Like good Cap'n Cuttle we'll smile and “stand by,”
Friendly bumpers we'll empty as fast as they brim 'em:
To welcome his guests Father NEPTUNE's delighted,
He'll clasp both their paws,
And drink deep to the Cause
Of Sailors as shipmates and Neighbours United !
Old NEP is “At Home" to the Sailors of France.
Old foes turn new friends as their reason grows riper;
* All hands for Skylarking!” A measure we'll dance,
With friendship for fiddler and pleasure for piper.
'Tis a good many years since they sought our white shore ;
Once more at hands’-grip we are glad to have got 'em.
As to Jingos or Chauvinists,-out on the bores!
Such Jonahs should promptly be plumped to the bottom;
Poor swabs! For this party they are not invited ;
Shall they come athwart hawse
As we drink to the Cause
Of Shipmates for ever and Neighbours United ?
Yes, we know that humanity fondly may scheme
For Peace, of all ills the supposed panacea :
We know that Utopia's only a dream,
Unbroken good fellowship but an idea.
Old NEP knows his great Naval Show is now on,
And ARMSTRONG and WHITWORTH's huge works he's aware
on ;
He sees what our shipwrights and gunsmiths have done
To send foes o'er the Styx in the barque of old Chaion.
At sight of War's muderous monsters half frighted,
E'en valour may pause,
And drink deep to the Cause,
Of Good-will among Nations and Neighbours United !
But, gushing apart, 'tis a sight for sad eyes
To see ancient rivals on joint messmate duty.
A French ship in our waters and not as a prize
Might once have perturbed British Valour and Beauty.
But now Father NEPTUNE, “At Home," calmly grips
His trident, and smiles with most friendly benignity..
We welcome French Sailors, and shout for French ships,
Without an abatement of patriot dignity.
To see any friend of John BULL NEP's delighted.
He holds out his paws,
And will drink to the Cause
Of Peace on the Ocean and Neighbours United !
Then shout, Britons, shout, while the neighbouring crews
Hob-nob, as the symbol of neighbouring nations ;
Whilst NEPTUNE at Home welcomes brave Brother Blues,
And serves out the stingo to each in fair rations.
Your spirits, ye sturdy old seadogs, might smile
On a friendship which to your true hearts is no treason.
The Sea-God makes free of his favourite Isle
The French lads he once would have shied, and with reason.
Now to greet brave GERVAIS and his tars he's delighted.
Midst general applause
Let us drink to the Cause.
Hooray for NEP's Visitors, Neighbours United !

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE DEMOGRAPHIC VADE MECUM.
Question. You properly attended the
Congress last week?
Answer. Certainly, by wearing a small
brooch pinned on the flap of my coat.
Q. What effect had this on the cabmen?
A. To cause them to charge me just
double the customary fares.
Q. Did you go to the Inaugural
Meeting?
A. Of course, but as it was so crowded,
I could get no further than the door.
Q. Did you hear the speech of the
Prince of WALES?
A. Unfortunately not; but I had the
advantage of seeing the top of his Royal
Highness's head.
Q. Did you go to the Soirée in Lin-
coln's Inn Fields, at the Hall of the
Royal College of Surgeons ?
A. I did, and was much amused at
finding myself drinking claret cup in
the museum devoted to skeletons.
Q. Did you go to the reception at
Guildhall ?
A. Certainly, and was greatly grati-
fied at the amusements supplied to the
Lord Mayor's guests.
Q. What were those amusements ?
A. So far as I could see, the Band of
the Grenadier Guards, conducted by
Lieut. Dan GODFREY in undress uniform,
playing before Sir JOSEPH SAVORY, Bart. ;
and some charters under a glass case.
Q. Was that all?
Ă. Well, I heard some harps, and then
of course there were the Lord Mayor's
trumpeters.
Q. Did you get your hat and coat in
comfort ?
A. In great comfort-after I had
fought like a wild beast with other wild
beasts for an hour and a half to get up
to the place of distribution.
Q. Was this part of the programme
badly managed ?
A. It was not managed at all. The
City Authorities had not even had the
sense to put the numbers available at each
counter en évidence.
Q. Did you derive any linguistic learn-
ing from this struggle?
4. Certainly. I heard bad language
in sixteen different tongues.
Q. And what (as a connoisseur) did
you think of the oaths ?
A. That none were comparable to that
English expletive which is equally sug-
gestive of a barrier in a river, the mother
of lamb, and the observations of an
angry man.
Q. Did you go anywhere else?
A. The entertainments I attended
were so numerous that it is impossible to
remember a tithe of them.
Q. And what did you do about Science
Å. Left it for discussion until the
moeting of the Congress to be held next

OLD Boy, let me in! Come, now, don't you be stupid !
Why stand at your door in that dubious way?
Like the classical girl who was called on by Cupid,
You seem half alarmed at the thought of my stay.
With meanings of mischief my mind is not laden ;
Be sure, my dear friend, that I shall not sell you,
As the artful young archer-god did the poor maiden,
Who let him in only his visit to rue.
I hope you ’ve not listened to enemies' strictures,
They've warned you, perhaps, against letting me pass.
I shan't soil your ceiling, I shan't
spoil your pictures,
Or make nasty smells like that dirty imp, Gas !
You ’re prejudiced clearly, and that is a pity,
Why, bless you, I'm spreading all over the place !
My spark is pervading the whole of the City;
The dingy old Gas-Hame must soon hide its face.
I'm brilliant, and clean, and delightfully larky;
Just look at my glow and examine my arc!
Fwizz! How's that for high, and for vivid and sparky!
I obviate dirt, and I dissipate dark.
You just let me in ; the result you 'll be charmed at.
Objections, Old Boy, are all fiddle-de-dee.

Ah, yes! it's no use to stand smiling and winking ;
I like the bright ways of you, youngster,-you bet!
You 're white as the moon, and as spry as a rocket;
No doubt all you say in self-praise is quite true,
But you see, boy, I must keep an eye to my pocket!
The Renters and Raters so put on the screw,
That a "middle-class income ” won't stand much more squeezing,
And Forty or Fifty Pounds more in the year.
For your bright companionship, albeit pleasing,
Would come pretty stiff, my boy. That is my fear.

the eatables and drinkables in five minutes than I can manage in the
full time allotted to refreshment; and not only this, but he finds
plenty of time for talking nonsense to one of the nicest-looking
waitresses. Of course, he positively refuses to speak a word of his
own native language, but gives his orders in English, Spanish, and
Russian, to the despair of all the attendants, with the exception of
the pretty waiting-maid, to whom he addresses himself in colloquial
French. She quite enters into the joke; can give and take as plea-

shouldn't be extended to three-quarters of an hour, and less time oc-
cupied on the journey to Paris, I have never yet been able to ascer-
tain. In the not very dim and distant future no doubt it will be so.
I record the above observation in italics, in order to attract the at-
tention of all whom it may and does and ought to concern. Perhaps
they'll kindly see to it.
Our déjeuner at Calais is as good as it usually is at that haven of
Restauration. After the buffeting of the waves, how sweet is the
buffet of the shore. I sit down at once, as an old Continental-
travelling hand, tell the waiter immediately what I am going to
take, and forthwith it is brought; then, in advance, I command the
coffee, and have my French money all ready in an outside-pocket,
so that there shall be no unnecessary delay. All station-feeding is
a fearsome pastime. You are never quite sure of the trains, and you
never quite trust the waiter's most solemn asseveration to the effect
that you have still so many minutes left, decreasing rapidly from fifteen
to five, when, time being up and the food down, you find yourself
hurrying out on to the platform, plunging recklessly in between the
lines, uncertain as to your carriage, and becoming more and more

[“Mr. RITCHIE ... has taken the unusual step of preparing a memorandum explanatory of ... the Public Health (London) Act, which comes into operation
on the 1st of January... The Vestries and District Councils . . , have come out with increased powers, but also with increased responsibilities. They are
in future known as the sanitary authorities'; they must make bye-laws, and enforce not only their own, but those made by the County Council; and, if
they fail in their duty--as, for example, in the matter of removing house-refuse, or keeping the streets clean-they are liable to a fine. It is pleasant
to think that, in future, any ratepayer may bring Mr. BUMBLE to book.”—The Times.]

SILENCE AND SLEEP.
(Lines written at Cock-crow.)
NIGHT-TIME and silence! O'er the brooding hill
The last faint whisper of the zephyr dies;
Meadows and trees and lanes are hushed and still,
A shroud of mist on the slow river lies ;
And the tall sentry poplars silent keep
Their lonely vigil in a world of sleep.
Yea, all men sleep who toiled throughout the day
At sport or work, and had their fill of sound,
The jest and laughter that we mate with play,
The beat of hoofs, the mill-wheel grinding round,
The anvil's note on summer breezes borne,
The sickle's sweep in fields of yellow corn.
And I too, as the hours go softly by,
Lie and forget, and yield to sleep's behest,
Leave for a space the world without a sigh,
And pass through silence into dreamless rest;
Like a tired swimmer floating tranquilly
Full in the tide upon a peaceful sea.
But hark, that sound! Again and yet again!
Darkness is cleft, the stricken silence breaks,
And sleep's soft veil is rudely rent in twain,
And weary nature all too soon awakes;
Though through the gloom has pierced no ray of light,
To hail the dawn and bid farewell to night.
Still is it night, the world should yet sleep on,
And gather strength to meet the distant morn.
But one there is who, though no ray has shone,
Waits not, nor sleeps, but laughs all rest to scorn,
The demon-bird that crows his hideous jeer,
Restless, remorseless, hateful Chanticleer.
One did I say? Nay, hear them as they cry;
Six more accept the challenge of the foe:
From six stretched necks six more must make reply,
Echo, re-echo and prolong the crow.
First shrieking singly, then their notes they mix
In one combined cacophony of six.
Miscalled of poets" herald of the day,”

But he knows that ordinary human nature is apt to be impressed by

conclude that it is some peculiar French way of marking distances
or laying out plots, and I find my conclusion is utterly erroneous.
“These white stones,” M. VESQUIER explains, . "mark the
boundaries of different properties.” Odd! The plain is cut up into
little patches, and champagne-growers, like knowing birds, have
popped down on "here a bit and there a bit and everywhere a bit”
from time to time, so that one headstone records the fact that “here
lies the property of J. M.," and within a few feet is another head-

pagne. And so on, and so on; the initials recurring again quite
unexpectedly, the plots of ground held by the same proprietor
being far apart. But, as it suddenly occurs to me, if these cham-
pagne-growers are all in the same plains for twenty miles or more
round about, all in much the same position, and all the grapes
apparently the same, why isn't it all the same wine ?

breaking off into Russian expletives, and interspersing his discourse
with selections from British national melodies, his explanation is
lucid, and the reasons evident. Soil and sun account for everything;
the soil being varied, and the sun shifty. “ Pou ni my? comprenez-

“ HOTEL ME, GENTLE STRANGER!”
[Mrs. WHEELER and Mrs. CUSTER, two literary ladies of New
York, are starting a hotel for women only.)

But OSCAR WILDE must 'pull up his socks,'
Ere he'll equal women at paradox.
What I mean is this, in our “ Women's Hotel,'
We'll have no such thing as the Curfew Bell,'
And no fixed hour for the cry, 'Out lights!'
We will give free way to true 'Woman's Rights,'
Which are to thump, strum, tap, twirl, trill,
From morn till night at her own sweet will.
That's why we cherish, despite male spleen,

BORN, JUNE 24, 1825. DIED, OCTOBER 6, 1891.
O’ER-BUSY Death, your scythe of late seems reaping
Swiftly our heads of State ;
The wise who hold our England's weal in keeping,
The gentle and the great.
GRANVILLE is gone ; and now another Warden
Falls with the fading leaf,
Leaving at Hatfield sorrow, and at Hawarden
Scarcely less earnest grief.
All mourn the Man whose simple steadfast spirit
Made hearty friends of all.
Whilst manhood like to his her sons inherit
England need fear no fall.
No high-perched, privileged and proud possessor
Of lineal vantage he;
Of perorating witchery no professor,
Or casuist subtlety.
A capable, clear-headed, modest toiler,
Touched with no egoist taint,
To Duty sworn, the face of the Despoiler
Made him not fear or faint.
O'erworn, o'erworked, with smiling face, though weary,
The tedious task he plied.
Sagacious, courteous, ever calm and cheery
Unsoured by spleen or pride.
As unprovocative as unpretentious,
Skilful though seeming-slow;
Unmoved by impulse of conceit contentious
To risk success for show.
O rare command of gifts, which, common-branded,
Are yet so strangely rare !
Selflessness patient, judgment even-handed
And spirit calmly fair!
Lost to his friends their worth may now be measured
By the strong sense of loss.

AN ESSAY IN REVIEWING.
We are obliged to "Beginner” for the
proffered contribution to our collection of
Book Reviews. That is, however, a depart-
ment of the paper our noble friend the BARON
DE BOOK-WORMS reserves for his own pen.
But as Mr. Punch has never been known to
discourage beginners, he finds room here for
the interesting contribution, which perhaps
should more appro-
priately have been
addressed to his con-
frère at the office of
the Athenæum :-
Don Quixote. By
MIGUEL CERVANTES.
We have conscien-
tiously plodded
through this volu-
minous work, which
is certainly not en-
tirely without merit.
It purports to recount the daily doings of a re-
sident in a village of La Mancha (Spain) who,
accompanied by a clownish retainer,
went forth
in search of adventures. He was not very
happy, his day's sport being invariably rounded
off by a sound drubbing, received either by
himself, his Squire, or both. We wish Lord
MACAULAY had lived to see the publication
of this work, and had with fuller leisure
relieved us of the task of reviewing it.
Remembering his method of procedure as
illustrated in his article on Dr. NARE's
Memoirs of Lord Burleigh, he would doubt-
less by careful enumeration have been able
to show that from first to last Don Quixote
had more ribs broken than any man has
actually possessed since ADAM was privy to
a diminution of their original number. He
seems also to have had a perpetual renewal
removal by brute force. As for the number
of legs and arms he had fractured, MACAU-
LAY's Schoolboy would have shrunk from the
task of computing their aggregate.
These are blemishes upon a work that is, at
least, well intentioned, and which might have
been more successful had our author been
inclined to give his hero credit for more
acumen. When he represents Don Quixote
as running tilt at windmills under the im-
pression that they are armed knights, and
members how years ago in the course of a dis-
cussion among literary men about books and
their writers, the Baron acknowledged that
in spite of his having been told how the pathos
of DICKENS was all a trick, and how the senti-
ment of that great novelist was for the most
part false, he still felt a choking sensation in
his throat and a natural inclination to blow
his nose strenuously whenever he re-read the
death of Little Paul, the death of Dora, and
some passages about Tiny Tim. There was
no dissentient voice as to the death of Colonel
Newcome ; all admitted the recurrence of
that peculiar choking sensation, read they
their THACKERAY never so often. Now the
Baron differs from Josh Sedley in, as he
thinks, many respects, but he is almost as
easily moved to tears” as was that stout
hero. Wherefore this preface? Well, 'tis
because the Baron owns to having "snivelled,”
if you will, when reading a delightful story,
published by MACMILLAN in one volume
("bless all good stories in one vol., clearly
printed!” says the Baron, parenthetically),
entitled simply, Tim. No relation to Tiny

A FALLEN LEADER.
CHARLES STEWART PARNELL.
BORN, JUNE 27TH, 1846. Died, OCTOBER 6TH, 1891.
“ The falcon-crest and plumage gone,
Can that be haughty MARMION?
Sir Walter Scott.
FALLEN! And not as leaders love to fall,
In battle's forefront, loved and mourned by all ;
But fiercely fighting, as for his own hand,
With the scant remnant of a broken band;
His chieftainship, well-earned in many a fray,
Rent from him-by himself!
None did betray
This sinister strong fighter to his foes;
He fell by his own action, as he rose.
He had fought all-himself he could not fight,
Nor rise to the clear air of patient right.
Somewhere his strenous soul unsoundly rang,
When closely tested. Let the laurels hang
About his tomb, for, with whatever fault,
He led with valour cool a fierce assault
Upon a frowning fortress, densely manned
With strong outnumbering enemies. He planned
Far-seen campaigns apparently forlorn ;
He fronted headlong hate and
scourging scorn,
Impassively persistent. But the task
Of coldly keeping up the Stoic mask
O'ertaxed him at the last ; it fell, and lo!
Another face was bared to friend and foe.
Scarce to his foes will generous judgment lean-
Foes mean as merciless, and false as mean,
Their poisoned pens, which even softening Death,
Which hate should hush and stifle slander's breath,
May not deprive of venom, prodding still
The unresponsive corse they helped to kill,
Is an ignoble sight. Turn, turn away!
Mean hates pursue the MARMION of our day,
A nobler foe, like Douglas, well may rue
His fall, and sigh, “ 'Tis pity of him, too!

every opportunity of becoming more attached to the soil.”—Mr. Goschen ut
Cambridge.]
ATTACHED to the soil! Pretty optimist phrase !
We are so, and have been, from Gurth's simpler days,
Though now platform flowers of speech-pleasant joke ! -
May wreath the serf's ring till men scarce see the yoke.
Attached to the soil! The soil clings to our souls !
Young labour's scant guerdon, cold charity's doles,
The crow-scarer's
pittance, the poor-house's aid
All smell of it! Tramping with boots thickly clayed
From brown field or furrow, or lowered at last
In our special six-feet by the sexton up-cast,
We smack of the earth, till we earthy have grown,
Like the mound that Death gives us-best friend—for our own.
We tramp it, we delve it, we plough it, this soil,
And a grave is the final reward of our toil.
Attached ? The attachment of love is one thing,
The attachment of profit another. Gurth's ring
Is our form of attachment at bottom, Sir, still,
And to favour that bond HODGE doubts not your good will.
But when others talk of improving our lot
By possession of more than a burial plot,
By pay for our toil, and by balm for our troubles,
You ban all such prospects as “radiant bubbles."
Declare "under-currents of plunder" run through
All plans for our aid save those favoured by you,
Attached to the soil! Ah! how many approve
That attachment, when founded on labour and love!
But about "confiscation” they chatter and fuss
At all talk of attaching the soil to poor us !

We are in a position to state that just prior to the General Election
of 1880, Mr. CHAMBERLAIN was observed standing before a cheval

he replied: “It is in view of the General Election. If on the plat-

should you be able rapidly to transfer your eyeglass from your right
eye to your left, and fix the obtruder with a stony stare, he is so
much engaged in wondering whether you can keep the glass in

their annual, and this time hopeful, account
of the Claret vintage, and when subsequently
Messrs. “P. and G.”—(who on earth are “P.

foot of a page, last Wednesday, enlivened
our drooping spirits with a brief but satisfac-
tory account of Champagne Prospects. If the
vintages of '86 and '87 are good, and those of
'90 and '91 poor, why not make a blend ? and
why not sell it as such ? Let “P. and G.”
[confound it! who on earth can P. and G.
be? “P. and J.” would be “Punch and Judy"
-and, by the way, in the choice Lingua
Tuscana," P. and G.” would stand for
“ Poncio è Giulia.” But, on the other hand,
who, unauthorised, would dare to use this
signature ? No matter - where were we?-ah!
to resume.] Let “P. and G.," whoe'er
they be-which is rhyme, though not so in-
tended-(but why this masquerade in initials?)
- let them exploit a “Blend of '90-cum-'86
and '91-cum-'87," sell it as such-viz., The
“P. and G. Blend,” or “The Punchius and
Giulia Blend"-at a reasonable figure, and
thus the Not-quite-up-to-the-mark vintages
will be saved. Have we not seen in City
partnerships how a strong house saves a fail-

fully? Let “P. and G.” give us a first-rate
Champagne, call it, say, The “G. B.," or
“Golden Blend," at a reasonable price, and,
to drop once again into poetry, No matter what
their name may be, We'll ever bless our P.
and G.!
“P. and G.” might stand for “Pay-for-it and
Get-it,” or “ Pour-it and Guzzle-it.” A Corre-
spondent has suggested that solution of the initial
problem might possibly be found in the names of

“For the purpose of so-called 'sport,' the Badger used
to be captured and put into a cage ready to be tormented
at the cruel will of every ruffian who might chose to risk
his dog against the sharp teeth of the captive animal.”.
This particular sort of "sport" is a little out of date.
But “ drawing a Badger” is not unknown even in these
humanitarian days. Dogs will sometimes voluntarily
rush in to risk their hides and muzzles against the afore-
said sharp teeth, &c. Look at those in the picture!
The two small, if aggressive, terriers seem unequally
matched against the clumsy, but strong-jawed and
terribly-toothed Badger. They have drawn him, indeed,
out of his hole, and one of them, at least, seems rather
sorry for it, if you may judge by the way in which he
turns tail and makes for his protector, the big Bull-

NOTHING LIKE LABOUR.
(A Pleasant Prospect suggested by the
evidence taken before the Royal Com-
mission.)
AND so the Unemployed rose from
the ditch in which he had passed the
night, and made for the town. It was
early morning, and he thought he could
possibly get something to do at the
baker's.
• Want to work ?" cried the foreman.
Why, my good fellow, it is all over
for the next two days. The trade only
allows four hours, so we begin at eight
on one night, and carry it on until
four on the following morning. People
get their loaves a little stale, but old
bread is said to good for the digestion!”
So the Unemployed went on until he
came to a half-built house. The work-
men had left, but there was still a
watchman on the premises.
“Want to work! Why what are you
thinking about! Why, our trade only
allows two hours a day, so we build a
house by laying foundation-stones. It
is rather slow, but very sure.”.
So the starving man continued his
journey. He was unsuccessful at every
trade centre. One industry allowed its
members to work only for three hours a
day, another two, a third four, and so
on. There was only one exception to the
rule, and this (so the doctor thinks) was
caused by necessity. The undertakers
were fully employed twelve hours out of
the twenty-four. Even the public-
houses were closed at noon. The work-
houses and casual wards were never
empty.
But being of a sanguine temperament,
the Unemployed cheered his drooping
spirits by murmuring, “Better fuck
to-morrow!” Then he retired to his
rather damp quarters in the country
ditch !

THE World last week sounded a
note about the compulsory retire-
ment, by reason of age, from one of
the large Revenue Departments, of
a gentleman who has the great honour
to be the son of “the most distin-
guished Irishman of this century."
If this sentence has really been passed
authoritatively, which Mr. Punch
takes leave to doubt, then said
“ Authority” will do well to recall
it in favour of the son of the Libera-
tor, which his name is also “DAN."
And, to give the well-known lines
so often quoted, -
" When DAN'L saw the writing on the
wall,
At first he couldn't make it out at all.”
And the sooner the official writing
on the wall, if it exists-be oblite-
rated, the better for the public ser-
vice, as, when the public, like the
Captain in the ballad of "Billy Tay-
Comes for to hear on't,” the

Beloved from pole to pole!
To get a thing at one-and-four,
For which your friend pays twopence

And cheaper than that Hansom cab
Whose tale I've told thee thus,
Far cheaper it had been to take
The stately omnibus !

Each takes his ticket in his hands,

And at my word it blew.
PART II.
The storm-blast came down Edgware

Shrieking in furious glee,

And he was big and black ;
He wore a little mackintosh

All mournfully mused I ;
It was too small a thing to keep
So large a beastie dry.

(Or what may be expected after a recent Verdict.)
SCENE-An Editor's Room. Editor and Chief Sub, discovered in
conversation.
Editor. And I think you have asked the Solicitors who have
threatened us with proceedings to be in attendance ?
Chief Sub. Yes, Sir. They are below-shall I send them up ?
Ed. If you please. One by one; and kindly impress upon them
the value of my time.
Chief Sub. Certainly. But I think you will find they will get

you would like to look at the Contents Bill, Sir ?

but it was your own idea that I should look you up:
Ed. Entirely. And now, Sir, perhaps you will kindly explain of
what your client has to complain.
First Solor. Certainly. You said of the senior member of the
Bounding Brothers of Bohemia, that, “although a very marvel of
strength and grace, he could scarcely, after fifty years' service in
the ring, be described as a trapèze-practising acrobat.”.
Ed. Well, surely that is a most complimentary allusion to his
personality! What does he want more than to be a marvel of
grace and strength " ?
First Solor. You say he can scarcely be described as a “trapèze-
practising acrobat.”.
Ed. Well, can he ? Does he ever practise on the trapèze ?
First Solor. Well, no. But he might if ſhe liked! You see his
chief business is to stand at the base of the pyramid, at the apex of
which is his smallest and lightest Bounding Brother. But he might
use the trapèze, I repeat, if he liked.
Ed. If what I hear is correct-it would have to be a strong one ?
First Solor. Certainly-an extra strong one. We don't deny that
our client weighs over twenty stone. But there, as we can accept
no explanation, will you kindly tell me the name of your Solicitor ?
Editor. Certainly:
[Gives the requisite information, and returns to his work, until
interrupted by Second Solicitor, who has taken the place of
the First.
Second Solor. I am afraid this interview is absolutely useless.
Our client can accept no apology. You announced that you believed
that John Snooks had ceased to be in the employment of the
Universal Cab and Fly Company.
Editor. Who is John SNOOKS?

that you have seriously injured us by telling the public that you
believed we had lost the services of one of our thousand drivers.

came to the conclusion that
men do really mean some-
thing by the extraordinary
gibberings and chatterings
in which they indulge. My
first experiment was on a female of the species, with a blue feather
in her bonnet. At a sign from me, a young Chimpanzee suddenly
and adroitly snatched the bonnet from her head. The sound she
uttered was, as nearly as I can put it, wh-00-w! ending in a shrill
scream. I therefore take the oo sound to indicate alarm, or dissatis-
faction. Exactly the same vowels were used by the Male.
The mischievous young of the Human Species, we have discovered,
also have this oo sound, and use it when they wish to frighten us.
The three conclusions which I have drawn from my inquiries are:-
1. That Human Beings understand the sounds they utter to each
other, and therefore possess a language, as we do.
2. That Human Beings have, in a very imperfect and rudimentary
shape, the faculty of reason.
3. That Apes have descended from Men! In other words, that

I have little more to add this week, but I think it
only right to hint that I am engaged in perfecting the
details of a scheme which will revolutionise finance. I
am not allowed, at present, to enter into full particu-

with the very highest person in the world of finance,
and that he is to submit my plan to the next Cabinet
Council. Briefly, when my scheme is floated, Consols
will immediately go to par, and will be converted into
a security bearing ten per cent. interest - and this
without a single penny being added to the tax-payers'
burdens. I have been authorised by the officials of the
Treasury to receive any investments that my readers
may offer. Now, therefore, is your time. Next week
I may have to take a short holiday, owing to the strain

QUITE FABULOUS !
(A Story of the Times, dedicated to Professor Munro.)
KING COLE, although described as a “merry old soul,”
was in reality a tyrant. He had a number of subjects
who used to work underground, and their labour was to
bring to the surface the black diamonds of the earth. It
was not altogether a pleasant occupation, but still, the
task had to be accomplished. His Majesty was fond of
ferocious practical jokes, and perchance this may have
been the origin of the jocular description attached to his
One day, some of his subjects complained that
their hours of labour were too many.
"How long do you work?” asked the King.
May it please you, Sire, sixteen," was the reply.
"Try what you can do with twelve," and they were
about to depart rejoicing, when the
Monarch called them
back and added, “But mind you, I shall expect just as
many black diamonds to be unearthed as before."
So the King's subjects worked only twelve hours, and
strange to say, quite as many black diamonds were pro-
duced as in the olden days. Then the workmen began to
grumble once more, and the King again interviewed them.
“Do you still work twelve hours ?” he asked the
deputation.
Certainly, Your Majesty; but we think half would
be quite enough,” returned the spokesman.
"By all means-why not make it three hours ?” and
again his subjects were departing, rejoicing, when once
more he added, “But I shall expect just the same output
as before."
And he got it, for the men worked harder than ever.
And then they came yet again to him. Once more they
considered the hours of labour excessive. They thought

« ON THE HYP”-NOTIST.
(Fragment from a Romance purely imaginary and yet to
be written.)
THE Savants were gathered together to consider the
question of Hypnotism. They had been appointed by a
learned Association, and their Hon. Secretary had distin-
guished himself by writing a letter, which if eccentric
in punctuation, was yet to the point.
* We must not forget, Gentlemen,” said one of the
learned persons," that we have been appointed to investi-
gate the use of Hypnotism as a therapeutic agent. It will
be our duty to ascertain, if it is possible, that operations
can be performed under the shield of its anæsthesia."
“You are indeed right,” replied another, “and it is
fortunate in one sense that we have not had the advantage
of greeting at our board, Doctor OWEN COLEMAN of
Dunedin, Surbiton."
“Why so ?” asked a third.
“Because," returned Savant No. 2, “that distinguished
Member of the Medical Profession can give instances of
successful treatment under the prescribed circumstances.
For instance, JULES CLOQUET, as early as 1845 was using
Hypnotism in the cause of painless surgery. However,
our pleasant little gathering can do no harm."
"Perhaps not,” acquiesced Savant No. 3. Although
it is only right to remark that had we had Dr. COLEMAN'S
knowledge, we should have possibly considered it qua
Committee a trifle superfluous.
Do you not think we ought to visit the Aquarium ?”
asked the first speaker. "I am told that there is a
Hypnotist who appears there twice a day, and whose
exhibition, from a scientific point of view, should be
decidedly interesting."
After this
there was a speedy departure, and for some
hours the Committee lounged about the Aquarium.

they paid a visit to the Alhambra, where they met a plea-

assisted vacation, and consequently had the chief towns of the world, so to speak,

swimmer. Then a second young woman recited something or other in German,
with an atrocious English accent. And the whole concluded with a lecture upon
chemistry (given by a seedy-looking old man), which was illustrated with some
ambitious, but feeble experiments.

Waiting December days to greet
The Beauty's" snowy beard has grown ;
Whilst all about his bulky form
Fir-hedge and holly sprout and twirl.
Sleeping he snoreth, snug and warm,
His breath scarce stirs his beard's crisp
He sleeps: the jolly, brave Old Bird,
Ruddy of phiz as warm of heart,
Who, when he's annually stirred,
Is always good, and game to "part.”
He sleeps: all round his cosy cell
His long-stored gifts are waiting use;
And-till awaked-he there doth dwell,
A cosy form in cosy snooze.

She travels under winter skies-
He yawned, and cracked his annual joke,
She stayeth not for storm or shocks And ran his fingers through his beard.
Celestial Grace with tender eyes,
“How say you? Is it slop or snow?
And loving lips, and golden locks. She answered, “Come along, old chap!
We've much to do and far to go,
She comes, well-knowing what she seeks ;
Ere you resume your annual nap."
She breaks the hedge, she enters there:
Love's flush illumes her maiden cheeks ;
THE DEPARTURE.
She hears Yule's chimes upon the air:
She holds aloft that mystic stalk,
And on the Old Sire's arm she leant,
With white globes decked, to lovers dear; and forth into the world they went,
And round her waist his arm did fold;
“Now, Father Christmas, wake and
walk!”
To glad the grieved, to warm the cold.
She whispers in the “Beauty's" ear.
Across the town, and far away,
Of kindness full, and frolic whim,

That white-wing'd Presence following him.

PUNCH PRESENTING YE TENTH, VOLUME TO YE QUEENE,
(1846.)
FROM W. M. THACKERAY TO MR. PUNCH. (FEBRUARY, 1849.)
Mr. Punch,—“When the future inquirer shall take up your volumes, or a bundle of French plays, and contrast the performance of
your booth with that of the Parisian theatre, he won't fail to remark how different they are, and what different objects we admire or
satirise. As for your morality, Sir, it does not become me to compliment you on it before your venerable face; but permit me to say,
that there never was before published in this world so many volumes that contained so much cause for laughing, and so little for
blushing; so many jokes, and so little harm. Why, Şir, say even that your modesty, which astonishes me more and more every time
I regard you, is calculated, and not a virtue naturally inherent in you, that very fact would argue for the high sense of the public morality
among us. We will laugh in the company of our wives and children ; we will tolerate no indecorum: we like that our matrons and
girls should be pure."
