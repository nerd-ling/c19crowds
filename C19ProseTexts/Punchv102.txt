PRERACT
kancey
SCENE-A snug riverside nook hard by a weir. Mr. PISCATOR Punch discovered enjoying the Contemplative Man's Recrea-
tion in a solitude à deux (with Tobias). To hin enter, from opposite sides, two furtive, mysterious, and apprrently
disguised personages, each bearing rod and line, but looking little to the piscatorial manner born.
First Angler (catching sight of second, aside, with acerbity). Tut! tut! He here ! Hoped he was at Hawarden !
Second Angler (catching sight of first, aside, peerishly). Confound him! what does he want? Had an idea he was at
Hatfield !
Mr. Punch (catching sight of both, aside, merrily). Aha! here they are. Can't leave me alone. Fancy I do not
recognise them, perhaps, in that ill-fitting Izaak-Waltonish disguise. (Sings.)
For Whigs are full of flattery,
And Tories full of pride ;
Heigh trolollie lollie loe!
Both fish for Votes, I fish for perch,
All by the river's side.
I 'm sure of unopposed return.
My countrymen know Me!
Heigh trollie lollie loe!
First Angler (aside). Hanged if he does not twig!
Second Angler (aside). Verily he seemeth to smell a rat!
Mr. Punch (aloud). Hail, Brothers of the Angle! Good-morrow to you both, and a pleasant pitch—at courteous
angler's correct distance. Whither away, Gentlemen ? And are you perchance beknown one to the other ?
First Angler (embarrassed). Well, Mr. Pu—Piscaton, we are not of a party on this occasion ; yet meseems I have
seen our friend in the voluminous collars somewhere ere now.
Second Angler (awkwardly). And I, on my part, seem to recognise that burly form, that bushy beard-
Mr. Punch (laughing). Oh, turn it up, my noble swells ! I know you, as you know each other—and Me! You
have both of you tracked me down to my rural retirement, with an eye, respectively, to “ tips." This fortuitous concourse
displeaseth you much, but you must make the best of it. Perpend, sham Piscators. What d'ye lack? What, in short, is
your little game, Gentlemen ?
First and Second Anglers (together). Well, you see, Sir, the Gen
[They both pause.
Mr. Punch (grarely). I perceive. In view of the imminent General Election, each of you thought he would like a
quiet hour alone with Mr. Punce, with an eye to "pumping " him-each in the interest of his Party. A miscalculation,
Gentlemen! Mr. Purch hath no Party-save Mankind; no Leader—but himself! However, don't look so uncomfortable,
the pair of you, but sit down sociably, help yourselves to the shandy.gaff
, and have a chat. Let “peace, and patience, and a
calm content cohabit in your cheerful hearts" (as they did in Sir HeXRY Wotton's), while—as he did -we "sit quietly in a

summer's evening, on a bank a-fishing." As CORYDON sang, "Fishers must not wrangle." Aha! his song might bo
parodied—for your behoof, Brother Anglers !
O the brave (Vote) fisher's life
We have sly baits in our horn,
Is the best of any !
Party paste and worms too ;
Full of pleasure found in strife,
We can work both night and morn,
So beloved of many.
Suffer toil and storms too.
Other joys
None do fear
Are but toys;
Arms to bear
Only this
In the fray ;
Stirring is,
Fight away!
For our WILL
Some sit still,
Polls will fill.
And bait with skill.
Power 's the only pleasure !
Wire-pullers must not wrangle !
First Angler. Ay, marry, Sir, now you talk like an artist! (Aside.) Only wish William were not here! Then I
might have a chance !
Second Angler (gravely). An art something too artful wholly to hit my taste. (Aside.) Oh, were Solly only away!
Can't speak freely and frankly in his presence.
Mr. Punch (twigging). Marry, scholars, 'tis little use “muttherin' there as if ye'd been ill-thrated." My best
counsel is at the service of both of you, as old Piscator's was, whether to VENATOR, AUCEPs, PETER, or CORYDON.
First and Second Anglers (together, eagerly). Well, what think you of my chances at the Gen ?
[Both stop short, and scowl at each other.
Mr. Punch (winking) singeth
I'm a gay but “leary" Sage, with my one, two, three,
I'm willing to give counsel or wise warning ;
But if it's me you'd pump, with a view to Party " stump,"
You must get up very early in the morning!
There is reason, put into verse, and worthy the consideration of a wise man, as honest old Izask says.
Second Angler (plaintively). But, Master, have you nothing pertinently practical to mix with this frolic discourse,
which, in view of the tremendous issues toward, doth now grow tedious and tiresome ?
Mr. Punch. Cheer up, honest Scholars, and perpend! I may not mar this bright June day, this sylvan scene, this
quiet swim, with platform platitudes, party bickerings, or wire-puller prophecy. I would rather hear Maudlin piping her
“ Milk-Maid's Song," or CORYDON trolling his catch. But if it is sage counsel you want, take it. You are about to enter on
a great political fishing match. Fight it out like honest anglers and good-tempered—like those that, as Izaak hath it, "are
lovers of virtue, and dare trust in Providence, and be quiet, and go a-angling." Fish fair, don't foul your opponent's tackle,
or needlessly disturb his swim. Don't use fancy or poaching baits, nor overmuch of any. Remember the old angling
maxim : “Swear not, lest ye catch no fish."
"Oaths do fray
Fish away,"
and vituperation loses Votes. Finally, if you be beaten, take your licking like a man—and an Angler. If further counsel
ye want, you will find it to the full of your joint and several needs and capacities in this my

THE PARLIAMENTARY ALMANACK FOR THE SESSION OF 1892.
BY ZADKIEL, M.P.)
FEBRUARY. — A pretty con-
junction of Venus with Jupiter
will take place in the evening
western sky on Saturday the 6th
inst. ; but, as the days are still
short, and the nights dark, the
interesting couple will probably
escape embarrassing observation.
About the same time there will
be a conjunction of the House of
Lords and the House of Coin-
mons, meeting to witness the opening of the new
Session by Royal Commission. The SPEAKER will
probably attend in wig and gown, and, as Mars speeds
on his way through the sign Sagittarius, the Sergeant-
at-Armarius will precede the procession, carrying the
Mace. About the middle of this month Venus will be
in opposition with Saturn, very near the Equator. This
will bring Sir WILLIAM HARCOURT to the front, want-
ing to know from the Government much more than
they are disposed to communicate. The stationary
position of Uranus, in 6° 5' of Scorpio, will bring trouble to the Home
Office, where the criminally lavish use of stationery (including pens)
is well known. Towards the end of the month there will be trouble
below the Gangway. The new Leader of tho House is warned to
beware of a sudden outbreak from Mr. LABOUCHERE, having reference
to the cost of the equipment of the Queen's yacht. South America will
suffer from severe shocks of carthquake, the Isle of Skye will be under a
cloud, and the Isle of Man will have trouble with its female population.
MARCII.-Jupiter is again in opposition with Saturn on the 6th inst.
at 8:51 P.M. The former planet being in Pisces 27', Sir WILLIAM
HIARCOURT says that before the month is out he means to knock the
Government into pieces 28. The evil Mars forms the quartile aspect
with Saturn on the 9th, and takes a friendly pint with Jupiter on the
11th. This period is therefore sure to be tempestuous. Earthquakes
will shake the South of Europe, and the First Lord of the Treasury,
the Secretary of State for India, and the First Door Keeper will have
their hands full of trouble. Greeco will also feel the disturbing
influence. Indeed if the MARKiss doesn't keep things straight with
Mr. GENNADIUS the fat will be in the fire. The 20th is rather a
fortunate day, but the 28th is an evil anniversary threatening quarrels,
losses, thunder-showers and skin eruptions. JOKIN is warned not to
select this date for bringing in his Budget. With the Moon in the
26th degree of the sign of Virgo, he will have quite enough trouble
without wantonly seeking it by disregarding the Voice of the Stars.
The 25th of this month is Lady Day, when rents and insurances fall
due. With Mars only just risen at the vernal equinox, strong in
Capricornus and in quartile aspect with the Sun, they had better be paid.
APRIL.-Saturn is on the cusp of the third house of the last new
moon. This threatens danger to Mr. CHAMBERLAIN who is warned to
safeguard his health, avoid dangerous places, and regard Mr. G. as if he
were a distant mountain. Mars is at it again. Progress of the red
planet through Capricornus disturbs Greece, shakes India to the core,
renders Mexico unquiet, and may have potent influence on the Red Earl.
Lord SPENCER is therefore warned to avoid during this month experiments
as to the suitability for his personal use of any stray high collars he may
find lying about his dressing-room, or in that of any blood relation.
Honours will be conferred on some Members sitting cither abovo or
below the Gangway. Magnetic currents very strong about the 26th.
Mr. BALFOUR will do well to note this.
MAY.--Mars enters Aquarius on the 6th of this month, and will not
leave the sign as long as there is a drop to drink on the premises. This
protracted stay will write the history of the Agricultural Department in
letters of blood and fire, bringing sorrow on GEORGIE HAMILTON, WIL-
FRID Lawson, and the borders of Wales. Jupiter's progress through Aries continues to benefit Old England, and gives Lord
HARTINGToy an opportunity of taking ten minutes pap on the Front Opposition Bench, whilst Mr. STANHOPE explains the Army
Estiinates in Committee of Supply. We shall hear of conflagrations and explosions at sea, with some trouble in the House of Lords.
The LORD CHANCELLOR, at whose birth the Moon held the 24th degree of tho sign Virgo, would do well to have the Woolsack carefully
examined before seating himself thereon. It is not for nothing that the Moon is this mooth eclipsed in the sign Scorpio.
JUNE.—Mars holds on his way through Aquarins, thereby disturbing Russia, bringing sorrow on Prussia, heaping coals of fire on
Piedmont and the borders of Persia. This will bring much occupation for the Foreign Secretary, who is warned to avoid any attempt
to walk from Hatfield to Downing Street without his hat. Wedilings will be numerous towards the en:l of the month. There will also,
in all probability, be some births and deaths. The Sun and Mercury in Gemini, forming the quartile aspect with Saturn in Virgo,
Members of the Opposition are warnod (if thor can avoid it) not to be born on the 8th, 19:h, 24th and 25th of this month. Mars
being in a lower meridian at the New Nioon of Midsummer Day, fires will be numerous, discord and strife will arise in connection with
the landel interest anil an Irish Member-perhaps two-rill be suspended. The sign Cancer rules New York, Berne and Lubeck. Sir
John LUBBOCK will, accord.ngly, do well to live quietly and avoid cha ges.

stationary in 1° 59' of Scorpio is of fresh evil omen for
the Lord CHANCELLOR. He is warned to avoid travelling by
water or riding on the garden-seat of an omnibus. Towards
the end of the month (the 9th instant being the day of the solar
conjunction with Venus) the House of Commons will be
counted out. The 17th is a propitious day for Members re-
presenting agricultural constituencies. Unfortunately, there
will be no sitting of the House on this day. An accident to
an ironclad moored off the Terrace. Duchesses and others
are warned not to take tea on the Terrace on the afternoon
of this day, for Mercury in his ruling sign (Leo) meets with
the opposition of Mars. Murs, as the Leader of the Opposition
in the Solar System, takes a fraternal interest in Mr. G.
AUGUST.--Mars still having a high old time in the high
old ’evings. He is now very near the Earth, and with his
mailéd hand urges on the Irish Members to deeds of ruthless
insubordination. About this time the SPEAKER may be ex-
pected to observe, " Order! Order!" Saturn re-enters the
sign Libra at 31 minutes past 9 on the evening of the 31st.
Consequently we shall hear of trouble in Kent, Macedonia, and
Staffordshire. Questions on these subjects will be addressed to
the Baron De Book-Worms, and, the Moon holding the third
degree of the sign Scorpio or the last degree of Virgo, Mr.
Julius ’ANNIBAL PICTON will move the adjournment of the
House, in order to discuss, as a matter of urgent public import-
ance, the unsatisfactory replies of the noble Baron. The 4th is a
very evil day for Her Majesty's Ministers, threatening danger
by fire or colic, according to their nativities. Let those who
were born in this month beware of danger by water, never
going out without an umbrella, or attempting to cross the
Thames by fording it. Morocco will experience some vibra-
tion, and Hon. Members whose rates were due on the 1st of
March, will do well to see they are paid. The Moon being
held in the 25th degree of Virgo, ladies following the course
of debate from the Gallery of the House of Commons, are
warned to beware of disappointment in love or matrimony.
The position of the Moon at this timo is also favourable to saltatory exercise on the part of the
cow." Mr. JESSE COLLixos is warned to hold out three acres beneath the orb, so as to break
the fall of the cow. As the Sun forms the trine aspect with Jupiter shortly before the New
Moon, Parliament will be prorogued this month, ij, Jupiter being in the fourth house, the dissolution
has not already taken place.

it was reported that a very large Porpoise had been washed
ashore. Everyone went down to see it, and among them VIOLET
and her governess. The little lass was in high spirits, for she had
boen indoors in disgrace for the last two days. VI was not a bit
afraid. She danced up to the Porpoise, who was puffing and blowing
and flapping his tail on the sand. The impudent little puss boldly
approached the monster of the deep, and giving him a good ringing
slap, said, “Poor old thing! Did it come ashore on porpoise ?
In a moment tho Porpoise lashed out its tail in anger, caught
the child on the side of the faco, and knocked her into the sea !
With great difficulty sho was rescued! It taught her a lesson she
nerer forgot. She returned home quite cured. She never makes
silly puns upon poor dumb animals now, and they have grown
to respect her very much. If ever she feels inclined to return to
her old foolish habit, ono glance at the silver porpoise-charm-
which her dear Father has given her—is sufficient to remind her
of hor folly, and prevent her transgressing.

No. II.–VIOLET AND THE PORPOISE.
VIOLET was a bright, merry little girl who was always full of fun.
She was rather too apt to be thoughtless. Her Father was very
witty and jocose, and she would often try to imitate him. She
seemed to forget what was a virtue
among grown-ups was unbecoming
in a child, and would sometimes say
something to cause a laugh without
reflecting how much pain it gave to
others. For the sake of a joke--to
make a mere play upon words, or a
pun as it is called, she would not in-
frequently make some silly remark
which would subsequently cause her
the keenest regret.
In vain did her kind Mamma im-
press upon her that puns would entail
punishment, and it seemed equally
futile for her to be told that punning
was the special prerogative of Papas.
It was not only to her kind
parents and friends that she would
behave in this manner. Poor in-
offensive dumb animals she would
treat in a similar fashion. She
would tell the Cow that she was a
“cowrious kind of animal”: she
would say, “I bullieve you, my
boy,” to the Bull, and would in-
form the Pig that it was very "pig,
culiar.” One day her Father found
her telling a large Cochin that, if it
did not move on, it would be "a-
cotchin' it," and heard her sub-
sequently remark, with regard
to a
tamarisk hedgo, * It-
am - a - risky kind of fence."
This was too much for her
long - suffering parent. He
found he was being beaten on his own ground, his position
as family joker was being imperilled, and his merry jests were
beginning to fall rather flat. He at once packed off this short-
petticoated punster to a strong-minded, serious, matter-of-fact
governess by the seaside, who looked upon punning, joking, and
whistling on the Sabbath as all very much in the same light. The
governess had instructions she might take what measures she
pleased, but the little girl was to be cured.
One day there was a terrific storm on the coast. When it abated,

For JULY.
This will be a great month for America.
Nothing much elsewhere. It may be assumed
that if the London County Council has hitherto
behaved with propriety (a large assumption),
now will be the time for the members to dis-
tinguish themselves, individually and collec-
tively, as idiots. They will be guilty of some
gross piece of folly that will be received with
derision by the world at large, and with joy by
the writers of comic copy.
FOR AUGUST.
On the 1st, the statutory Bank Holiday will
be observed by the overcrowding of excursion-
trains and the enlivening of quiet watering-
places. Rejoicings at Margate. After months
of wrangling over the smallest and least im-
portant measure, a year's legislation will be
hurried through both Houses in half-a-dozen
days. Goose-shooting commences. Hampers

compose himself to mend the fire, and draw his chair to
the warm hearth. But, when he had done so, and had

Quite so, Ma'am! Very true, Sir! My.“ conceptions,

Doctor T. (gravely). You see, JOSEPH, there are some
things in your earlier school career which your well-
wishers would fain-forget. You were rather what is
called, I think, a young Radical” once, not to say “a
bit of a pickle.” You seemed not altogether out of sym-
pathy with such revolutionary proceedings as “revolts”
and barring-outs,” and even talked once, if I remember
rightly, of putting the Principals “to ransom"-doc-
trines better worthy of a Calabrian brigand than of a
public school-boy. But let bygones be bygones. Now
that you are in a position of responsibility and re-
spectability, you will, of course, abandon all such
revolutionary rubbish, and think not of yourself, but
others; consider less the wild wishes of your inferiors
than the wise commands of your betters.

CABITAL!
SIR, — The proposal to extend the Cab
Radius to five miles from Charing Cross is
good in its way, but it does not go far enough.
My idea is that the cheap cab-fare should
include any place in the Home Counties.
Cabmen should also be prevented by law from
refusing to take a person, say, from Piccadilly
to St. Albans, on the plea that their horse
"could not do the distance." All assertions
of that kind should be punished as perjury.
Cabmen are notoriously untruthful. Why

SIR, -Why will people libel the Suburbs,
and keep on describing them as dull? I am
sure that a place which, like the one I write
from, contains a Lawn Tennis Club (entrance
into which we keep very select), a Circulating
Library, where all the new books of two years
back are obtainable without much delay, a
couple of handsome and ascetic young Curates,
and a public Park, capable of holding twenty-
six perambulators and as many nursemaids
at one and the same time, can only fitly be

“ OUT IN THE COLD!”
["I am like a traveller lost in the snow, who
begins to get stiff and to sink down while the
snowflakes cover him. In fact, I am gradually
losing interest in politics, but the feeling, like that
of the traveller sinking under the snow, is a pleasant
one." — Prince Bismarck to the Deputation of
Leipsic Students.)
AIR—" Excelsior!”
The century was waning fast,
As through a wintry waste there passed
A man, who bore, 'mid snow and ice,
A banner with the strange device,
Excel no more!
His brows were blanched; his eye beneath
Flashed like a falchion from its sheath;
Red fields had heard his armour clang,
But now he smiled and softly sang,
Excel no more!
In barracks huge he saw the might
Of mailéd hosts arrayed for fight;
Afar the fierce Frank bayonets shone,
And from his lips escaped a moan,
Excel no more!
“Think of the Past!” the young men said,
“Like Saul you towered by the head
Midst those three Titans, Prussia's pride!”
Softly that once stern voice replied,
“Excel no more !"
“Oh, stay,” the young men cried," and mix
Once more in Teuton Politics !”
"Nay," said the Titan, “I grow old,
And, like poor Tom, I am a-cold!
Excel no more!”
“Beware the snow-encumbered branch!
Beware the whelming avalanche!”
“Thanks!” he replied. “I know, I know.
But-well, I rather like the snow !
Excel no more!”
“Lost in the snow! An easy death!
Gentle surcease of mortal breath!
I sink, I stiffen, I'm foredone!
The feeling though 's a pleasant one;
Excel no more!”
The traveller by his faithful hound
Half-buried in the snow was found,
Still muttering from a mouth of ice
That banner's late and strange device,
Excel no more!
There in the snow-drift cold and grey,
Silent, but stalwart, still he lay,

to all managers, actors, actresses, scene-painters, authors,
composers, musicians, costumiers, and wig-makers who
will honour him with their attention. On this occasion
the Professor will (among other things) explain, by the aid
of a Magic Lantern (an entirely new invention recently
discovered by Professor H. H.) how to enlighten the stage
darkness generally. The Professor will also combat the
erroneous impression derived from the dark ages of SHAK-
SPEARE's time, that the Moon, or the Man in it,-probably
a lime-lighterman,-ought servilely to follow the move-
ments, in order to throw light upon them, of the Prin-
cipal Performer. The Professor will observe Such a
course, on the part of the Direction of the Moon, can only
be considered beneficial to Art, when it is directed against
* The Star System.' As each theatrical Star has its own
particular brilliancy, why lug in the Moon ? SHAK-
SPEARE, no doubt, had the Stage Moon in full view
when he makes Juliet roundly exclaim, 'Oh, swear not
by the Moon, the inconstant Moon!'as, of course, a
Moon bound to illuminate the business of any one actor
must follow him about, and so, though 'constant' to
him individually, would be open to a general charge of
inconstancy from the spectators in front. Such a course
for the Moon to take is, as some of the better instructed
among you may possibly be aware, quite unwarranted
by the lunar laws of Nature, &c., &c.'
This interesting entertainment will wind up
with a dia-
logue between Arthur (JONES) and Hubert (HERKOMER),
of which we give an extract. It represents Arthur as
wishing to produce a piece, which Hubert forewarns him

They are ready the waves, or the flames, or

Dealt with in fashion orthodox
By Bumble bodies hard as rocks,
And stern as tykes;
And treated like mere waifs and crocks,
Or herded Smikes!

Have somehow fallen out and fought,
Though each your welfare swore he sought;

How could two Shepherds shindy so.

To all poor muttons.
O Sirs, whoe'er would have expected
That crook and pipe you'd have neglected,
By foolish love of fight infected
Concerning food ?
As though the sheep would have rejected
Aught that is good!
What herd like JOSEPH could prevail ?
His voice was heard o'er hill and dale;
He knew each sheep from head to tail
In vale or height,
And told whether 'twas sick or hale
At the first sight.
But Joe had a new-fangled plan
For feeding ancient sheep. The man
Posed as a true Arcadian,
With a great gift
For zeal humanitarian,
Combined with thrift.
But JOHN replied, "Pooh-pooh! Your
scheme
Is but an optimistic dream,
Whose .shadowy incentives' seem
The merest spooks.
Better the ancient plans, I deem,
Food, folds, and crooks.
"You do not grapple with the case
Of poorest sheep, a numerous race.
As to the black ones, with what face
Claim care for such ?
'Tis hungry old sheep of good race
My feelings touch.
“ Your scheme will cost no end and fail.
No sheep who ever twitched a tail
So foolish is-I would not rail !-
As such a 'herd.'
I'd modest operations' hail,
But yours ?-absurd !
"Better reform, relax, extend
The old provisions. I commend
Plenty of food, and care no end,
For all poor sheep;
But flocks would not get poor, my friend,
Had they good keep!”
Fancy how JOE would cock a nose
Cockney JOHN,” as certain foes
Called JOSEPH's rival. Words like those
Part Shepherd swains.
Sad when crook-wielders meet as foes
On pastoral plains !
Such two! O, do I live to see
Such famous pastors disagree,
Calling each other-woe is me!-
Bad names by turns ?
Shall we not say in diction free
With BOBBIE BURNS ?

By mosses, meadows, moors and fells,
Come join your counsels and your skills
To cowe the lairds,
And get the brutes the power themsels

IN THE SEAT OF WISDOM.
At a meeting of the Drury Lane Lodge of Freemasons,
said the Daily Telegraph, with all due solemnity was
Mr. S. B. BANCROFT installed in the Chair of King
SOLOMON.” This, whether an easy chair or not, ought
to be the seat of wisdom. Poor Solomon, the very much
married man, was not, however, particularly wise in his
latter days, but, of course, this chair was the one used by
the Great Grand Master Mason before it was taken from
under him, and he fell so heavily, “never to rise again.”
How fortunate for the Drury Lane Masons to have
obtained this chair of SOLOMON'S. No doubt it was one
of his wise descendants, of whom there are not a few in
the neighbourhood of Drury Lane, who consented to part
with this treasure to the Masonic Lodgers. So here's

WEATHER REFORM.
SIR, -Acquiescence in the state of the weather is no
longer comme il faut. Bombarding the Empyrean is as
little regarded as throwing stones at monkeys, that they
may make reprisals with cocoa-nuts; yet the success of
the rain-makers is very doubtful. Their premisses even
are disallowed by many considerable authorities. The
little experiment which I propose to submit to the
meteorological officials is founded on a fact of universal
experience, and, if successful, would be of immense
utility: Every smoker must be aware that the force of
the wind varies inversely as the number of matches.
On an absolutely still day, with a heavy pall of fog over
the streets, the striking of the last match to light a pipe
is invariably accompanied by a breeze, just strong
enough to extinguish the nascent flame. Now if two or
three thousand men simultaneously struck a last match,
the resulting wind would
be of very respectable strength
-anemometer could tell that.
My proposal then, is this. When anticyclonic con-
ditions next prevail, and the great smoke-cloud incubates
its cletch of microbes, let some 5,000 men, provided at
the public expense with a pipe of tobacco and one match
each, be stationed in the City, at every corner and along
the streets, like the police on Lord Mayor's Day. At a
given signal, say the firing of the Tower guns, each man
strikes his match. Judging from the invariable result
in my own case, this would be followed by 5,000 puffs
of wind of sufficient strength to extinguish the lights, or,
better still, to give the 5,000 men some thirty seconds
of intense anxiety, while the wind plays between their
fingers and over their hands and round the bowls of their
pipes. Multiplying the men by the seconds (5,000 x 30)
you get approximately the amount of the wind, in wear
and tare and tret. If this experiment were conducted on
a duly extensive scale round London ; say at Brixton,
Kensington, Holloway and Stepney ; there can be no
doubt that a cyclone would be established, and the fog
effectually dissipated. The cost would be slight, and the
pipe of tobacco would afford a welcome treat to many a
poor fellow out of work in these hard times.
Yours obediently,

“VIVE LA LIBERTÉ !"
THE Era at one time used to
enjoy a monopoly of strangely,
but purely professionally-worded
advertisements ; but now the
Daily Telegraph is creeping up
and commencing to occupy the
Era's special domain.. One day
last week in the D. T. the follow-
ing notice appeared : “ Mr.
CHARLES SUGDEN at liberty.
Address, &c.” “At Liberty!”
How will this sound to the un-
initiated millions ? Taking for
granted that the readers, whose
name is Legion, know perfectly
well who and what Mr. CHARLES
SUGDEN is, having a lively re-
collection of this talented actor
as among the best representatives
of bad characters (excepting per-
haps that of William of Orange,
which was Mr. SUGDEN's chef
d'auvre, and a bout whose
character there are strong differ-
ences of opinion), will they not
unnaturally be 'led to inquire
how, why, when and wherefore
Mr. SOGDEN ever came to be de-
prived of his liberty, and under
what circumstances he has been
restored to it, or it to him? “At
Liberty!” It has a grand and
glorious sound I This distin-
guished. Thespian was never an

be
the Rover is free ! SUGDEN
is a name honourable behind and
before the foot-lights.
In the
Courts of Law it is a Legal
Light, and among Gas Companies
the Sugden Burner is, we believe,
justly famous. Whatever the
announcement may or may not
mean, all sons of Liberty will
rejoice that this eocentric comedian
is once more free, and on the stage
he will be again most welcome.
ON RELIGIOUS CYMBALISM.
The Salvationist Bands which
perform in and out of London-
(would that they were restricted
as the Moore and Burgess Minstrels
restrict themselves to one hall,
never or “hardly ever,” perform-
ing out of London!)-everywhere
and anywhere without respecting
illness, or the hours of public wor-
ship in our Churches and Chapels,
or the necessities of repose, show
thereby a distinct want of that
consideration for the feelings of
their fellow-citizens which simple
Christian folk call Charity. These
Booth performers—which desig-
nation savours suggestively of
Mountebanks-would do well to
play their peculiar music and sing
their peculiar hymns within the
four walls of their own places of
worship, employing the intervals
essential for gaining of wind and
for rest of muscle in meditating,
perhaps breathlessly, on the in-
spired Pauline teaching which will
inform them that even the works
of an Apostle, if he have not
charity, will be as
“sounding
brass and tinkling cymbals,"
making, indeed a great noise in
the world, but as one WILLIAM
SAAKSPEARE has said, being mere
"sound and fury signifying .no-
thing." “Liberty of Worship"
by all means, but not such Liberty
for any one particular form of
worship, which, interfering, with
the freedom of others, speedily de-
generates into fanatical licence,
and so becomes a nuisance as in-
tolerant as it is intolerable.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.-Quoth one of the Baron's Assistants to his Chief, “Sir, those who love the personality, and venerate
the memory of CHARLES DICKENS, will thank Miss HOGARTH who has selected, Mr. LAWRENCE Hutton who has edited, and OSGOOD,
MCILVAINE & Co. who publish, a series of letters addressed by Boz to WILKIE COLLINS. They bear date between the years 1851 and
1870, were found among Collins's papers after his death, and prove not the least
precious of his possessions. Foster's Life of Dickens will undoubtedly remain the
medium through which the outer world shall know the great novelist.” “True,"
interposes the Baron, “that
certainly is one way in which
admiration for the works of
the great novelist will be
foster'd among us.
You
agree? Of course you do
Proceed, sweet warbler, your
observations interest
much.” Whereupon the
warbler thus addressed con-
tinued. “But, Sir, we are
all conscious of a certain un-
pleasant taste those volumes
leave in the mouth. Some of
the incidents recorded, and
many of the letters, present
DICKENS with undue promin-
ence in a possible phase of his
character, as a ruthless trades-
man in literature and lectur-
ing, with some tendency to be
overbearing in his social re-
lations. In this little volume
of letters to his old familiar
friend we find him at his best,
whether as a worker in lite-
rature or as a critic of other
people's work."

say finds eloquent expression on the face of our friend JOAN G.

before, and have made up their minds on the subject. They are
ready to vote, but they will not remain to hear the speeches. As
you say, in such circumstances it would appear more businesslike to
take the vote at once, and get along with other work. But that is
unparliamentary. This will be kept going till there is just time left

PHILOSOPHIC STUPIDITY.
["It is better to do a stupid thing that has been done before,
than to do a wise thing that has never been tried.”—Mr. Balfour
in the House of Commons.)
HEAR the great pundit; deem him not absurd,
He utters wisdom's latest, greatest word.
All coats, we know, are best when frayed with wear;
Trousers we love when most they need repair,
Boots without heels, completely lacking soles,
And hats all crushed and battered into holes.
Nay, we'll go farther, and, to prove him true,
Do all the
vanished ages
used to do.
We'll crop the ears of those who preach dissent,
And at the stake teach wretches to repent.
Clad cap-à-pie in mail we'll face our foes,
And arm our British soldiery with bows.
Dirt and disease shall rule us as of yore,
The Plague's grim spectre stalk from shore to shore.
Proceed, brave BALFOUR, whom no flouts appal,
Collect stupidities and do them all.
Uneducate our men, unplough our land,
Bid heathen temples rise on every hand';
Unmake our progress and revoke our laws,
Or stuff them full of all their banished flaws.
Let light die out and brooding darkness reign,
And in a word call Chaos back again.
Then, as we perish, we can shout with glee,
“Hail, hail to BALFOUR and Stupidity!"

(An Effort in the Spasmodic-Obscure, after the American Original quoted
by Mr. James Payn in “Our Note-Book.”)

Collided, squirmed, then howled aghast,
Each to the other, “What's your trouble ?"

Affected to admire, and quote it!".
The other wailed, with shame-bowed head,

THE two Convicts were tried at the same Assizes, put in the same
dock and sentenced by the same Judge. So a companionship sprang
up between them considering that one was by birth and education a
Gentlemen, and the other was not. And they went to the same
prison, and listened to the same words of the same Chaplain, and
took their occasional exercise in the same practising yard.
And as
luck would have it, they served the same time, and were liberated at
the same moment.
“I am afraid I must say good-bye, Giles,” said ST. JAMES, as they
emerged into freedom from the portals of the gaol. Good fellow as
you are, GILES, you do not belong to my set, and your presence
would be embarrassing."
“Oh, would it!” returned GILES, who had already recognised some
of his friends. “Well, I don't want to press my company on anyone."
“No offence !” exclaimed ST. JAMES, “I beg you-no offence! But
we have both to begin life again, and union is not strength in a case
such as ours!”
“Oh, no offence !” acquiesced GILES, as he accompanied some of
his pals to a neighbouring public-house.
ST. JAMES, left to his own devices, hurried to the Chambers that he
used to rent before he went to prison. They were “ To Let." He
rang the bell, and the porter started back when he saw him.
Hope you don't want to enter, Sir," said he; “but the Guy'nor
gave strict orders, as if you called, that you was not to go in. It ain't
my fault, Sir, but the Guy'nor is the Guv'nor!”
Disheartened by this rebuff, he tried the house of a friend, but
was so scornfully received, that he made up his mind never to visit
another acquaintance. Of course he found that his name had been
removed from his Clubs, and not a single individual would recognise
him. He was an outcast, and a ruined man. So he walked about

WHAT DO THEY MEAN BY IT?
In an interesting description (that
appeared in the Times for Saturday,
February 27) of the working of the
"Jacquard Card-Preparing Machine,'
which is, it appears,
a machine for
superseding the human brain, eye,
and hand"-(so that soon all who can
afford it will be fitted up with these
machines, and keep their brains, eyes,
and hands in reserve for very special
occasions)-it was stated that the
blank cards are automatically fed
to the punches.” That punches should
be spelt without the capital P is of
course a Printer's error, deserving
capital punishment. Mr. P. thinks
it right to state in answer to nume-
rous inquiries, that all his Punches
speak by the card. But as to even the
smallest of the Punch family being
fed” on cards, or getting his or her
living by cards, the statement is
utterly at variance with the facts.
Mr. P. is quite sure that the
* Jacquard Automatic Reading and
Punching Syndicate" will at once
retract the injurious statement, or the

Punches will be inquiring of Mr. P.,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“ON THE BLAZON'D SCROLL OF FAME.”
[To each man of the Crews of the three Life-boats stationed in the Isle of
Wight, at Brighstone, Brook and Atherfield, respectively, Mr. Punch has
had pleasure and pride in presenting an illuminated copy of the Picture and
Poem entitled “MR. PUNCH TO THE LIFB-BOAT Men,” which appeared in
his issue of February 13. The names of the coxswains and crews of these
three boats, the Worcester Cadet, the William Slaney Lewis, and the
Catherine Swift, are inscribed thereon (as they should be in the memories of
all true Britons), as follows:-Of the Worcester Cadet, James Cotton
(Coxswain), ROBERT BUCKETT (Second Coxswain), ROBERT SALTER,
WILLIAM BARTON, FRANK EDMUNDS, FRANK BUCKETT, GEORGE New,
GBORGE MORRIS, GEORGE SHOTTER, GEORGE Hawker, EDGAR White,
WILLIAM MERWOOD, and JAMES HEDGECOCK.
Of the William Slaney Lewis, John HAYTER (Coxswain), BEN JACOBS
(Second Coxswain), ROBERT COOPER, W. Jacobs, J. Cooke, G. WHITE,
W. Cassell, T. HOOKEY, J. NEWBURY, J. COOPER, J. HOOKEY, R. Wood-
FORD, M. CASSELL, WILLIAM HAYTER, W. BLAKE, and W. HOOKEY.
of the Catherine Swift, WILLIAM COTTON (Coxswain), DAVID COTTON
(Second Coxswain), JAMES Cotton, Thomas Cotton, FRANK Cotton,
JOAN Cotton, CHARLES Cotton, WALTER WOODFORD, WALTER WHITE,
CHARLES HARDING, and B. WHILLIER.
These names thus receive-as they deserve-honourable record " For dis-
tinguished bravery and gallant conduct whilst on duty on the occasion of
the wreck of the s.s. Eider, January 31, 1892.”]
On the Scroll! And why not? Be you sure that it bears
Many entries less worthy of record than theirs,
The rough sea-faring fellows, whose names now go down,
With applause from their Sovereign to swell their renown,
To posterity's ears. And right pleasantly, too,
They should sound on those ears; for, run over each crew
And you 'll find that those names have a true homely smack
Both of country and kinship; there's JIM, there is Jack,
There is Bob, there is BILL, Tom and GEORGE, CHARLIE, FRANK ;
Can you not hear them sound o'er the waves as in rank
They go down to their work, ringing right cheery hail
Through the shrieks of the storm that shall not make them
pale,
Those bold Britons ? They're brothers, sires, cousins, and sons,
For see how the “ family name" through them runs
Those COTTONS could make up a crew at a pinch !
Whilst the HOOKEYS and WHITES from that task need not Alinch.
Yes, these names sound as well on the Scroll, after all,
As NAPOLEON or CÆSAR; and when the Great Call
Of the last human Muster Roll comes, some plain “ BILL,"
Whose business was rather to save than to kill,
May step before mad ALEXANDER.
Well, brothers,
(You BUCKETTS, and WOODFORDS and COOPERS and others,
Whose names he need hardly string into his rhymes,)
Punch hopes you may look on this Record sometimes
With pleasant reflections. Mere words, he well knows,
Will not—“butter your parsnips”—(to put sense in prose):
But you have his hearty good will, and you know it, –
Right gladly he takes this occasion to show it!
And when or wherever another should come,
Be sure your friend Punch won't be careless or dumb!

If anyone dared stop his play,
He screamed out—"Take the wretch away !
Oh, take my enemy away!
I won't have any foes to-day!”
His old adviser WILHELM swore
Was a pig-headed senile bore.
He meant to try another tack,
So his Old Pilot got the sack.
Nay more, one day, in a fierce squall,
He smashed his picture on the wall;
Tore up the papers when they said
He was a little off his head.”
He yelled, in his despotic way,
“Not any Press for me," I say !
“Oh, take that nasty Punch away!
I won't have any Punch to-day!
He deemed himself, and this was odd,
A sort of new Olympian god;
And when the wise, who watched his whim,
Sighed, “Have the gods demented him?
Quem deus vult, et cetera,” he
Was just as mad as mad could be ;
And, just like other angry boys,
Kicked over tables, smashed his toys,
And cried out, " Take the things away!
I'll have nought but new toys to-day!
“Prudence?" he yelled; "what do I care?”
And here he kicked the old pet Bear
His sire and grandsire had so cherished,
Till the old policy had perished
With Wilful WILHELM, who preferred
The Eagles. With a pole he stirred
Big Bruin up. “Oh, I'll surprise him !
And, if he growls, I'll pulverise' him.”
Some thought that picking rows with Brain
Meant folly, if it did not ruin ;
But when they whispered words of warning,
Then Wilful WILHELM, counsel scorning,
Shrieked, " Take the nasty brute away!
I won't have any Bears to-day!”
Now, WILHELM, do not be absurd,
But listen to a friendly word!
You are a clever boy, no doubt,
And very smart, and very stout,

Whose story is in Struwwelpeter,

had just marked an epoch in her mental development, and that she
considered it quite the supreme achievement of the Art of the
Century: A ponderous man in spectacles, whom TICKLER had no
recollection of having ever met before in his life, encouraged him by
his solemn assurance that his “ Jews Sitting in a Dentist's Waiting-

realism and historical accuracy, and that it ought to become the
property of the Nation; while an elderly lady, in furs and a
crimped front, declared that the pathos of his nursery subject-a

ceiling —"shall we not beat the dastard foe from Camford
to-morrow?" A roar of applause sprang from the
smoking mouths of his seven companions.
But at this moment the Duchess of AVADRYNKE and
Lord PODOPHLIN rose unobserved and quitted the room.
In another minute the sound of hurrying wheels, gradu-
ally growing fainter in the distance, was heard by no one
in the avenue. And the dance went on, and revelry rose
to its maddest pitch. But no one, who, as has been re-
corded above, had heard the sound of the wheels, gave a
thought to the Duke of AVADRYNKE, as he sat tearing
his hair in the violet bedroom, having learnt from the
faithful Seneschal the terrible news of the Duchess's
elopement with the heir to the house of PODOPHLIN,
CHAPTER III.
The morn of the race dawned clear and sparkling. Far
as the eye could reach, the banks of the river were rich
with Millions, and firm enough to bear any run upon
them however heavy. But Sir WELFORARD LONGSTROKE
was ill at ease. His No. 5 had fled leaving no trace, and
he had no one to fill the vacancy. He looked the very
model of an aquatic hero. His broad chest was loosely
clad in a pair of blue satin shorts, and his fair hair fell
in waving masses over his muscular back. His thoughts
were bitter. The Camford crew had started on the race
some ten minutes ago, and the Oxbridge craft still waited
idly in the docks for want of a No. 5,
Surely,” Sir WELFORARD thought to himself, “Po-
DOPALIN might have postponed the elopement for one
day.” A confused noise interrupted his meditations.
Some ten yards from him a man roughly clad, but with
the immense muscular development of the Arri Furnese
A pollo, was engaged in fighting three bargees at once,
As Sir WELFORARD stepped forward, this individual
struck a terrible blow. His ponderous fist, urged by the
force of a thirty-inch biceps, crashed through the chest
of his first foe, severed the head of the second from his
body, and struck the third, a tall man, full in the midriff,
propelling him through the air into the middle of the river.
“That's enough for one day,” he said, as with an air
of haughty melancholy he removed his clay-pipe from
his mouth. His face seemed familiar to Sir WELFORARD.
REALLY PLEASANT !
Who could he be ? All doubt was removed when he
advanced, grasped Sir WELFORARD by the hand, and, in

“The good grey Poet” gone! Brave, hopeful Walt!
He might not be a singer without fault,
And his large rough-hewn rhythm did not chime
With dulcet daintiness of time and rhyme.
He was no neater than wide Nature's wild,
More metrical than sea-winds. Culture's child,
Lapped in luxurious laws of line and lilt,
Shrank from him shuddering, who was roughly built
As cyclopean temples. Yet there rang
True music through his rhapsodies, as he sang
Of brotherhood, and freedom, love and hope,
With strong wide sympathy which dared to cope
With all life's phases, and call nought unclean.
Whilst hearts are generous, and whilst woods are green,
He shall find hearers, who, in a slack time
Of puny bards and pessimistic rhyme,
Dared to bid men adventure and rejoice.
His "yawp barbaric” was a human voice ;
The singer was a man. America
Is poorer by a stalwart soul to-day,
And may feel pride that she hath given birth
To this stout laureate of old Mother Earth.

OUR CRICKETERS.—The English Cricketing Team came
to the end of their Australian tour last week, where,
under the leadership of Lord SHEFFIELD, out of twenty-
six matches they won thirteen, lost two, and eleven were
drawn. The Eleven of course were drawn over and over
again, i.e., photographed. It will henceforth be a recom-
mendation for any Cricketer to say he was out under this
distinguished captaincy, as to this introduction the host
will rejoin, “Ah, I know that man, he comes from SHEF-

played with GRACE.

about by the stupid ignorance of a dunderheaded ecclesiastic, to whose
Bishop Laertes ought to have immediately reported him), Hamlet
returns to weep and throw flowers into the grave. Now excellent
"returns” are dear to the managerial heart, and consoling to his
pocket, when they attest the overflowing attendance of " friends in
front;" but when returns" are on the stage, their excellence may
be questioned on the score of monotony. Now, as to the Church-
yard Scene, permit me to make a suggestion :—the Second Grave-
digger has been commissioned by the First Gravedigger, with money
down, to go to a neighbouring publican of the name of YAUGHAN,
pronounced Yoganor Yawn, -probably the latter, on account
either of his opening his mouth wide, or of his being a sleepy-headed
fellow,-and fetch a stoop of liquor. Now, when all the turmoil is
over, the remaining gravedigger would at once set to work, as in
fact he does in this scene at the Haymarket; but here he just shovels
a handful of mould into the grave, and then, without rhyme or
reason (with both of which he has been plentifully supplied by
SHAKSPEARE), suddenly away he goes, merely to allow for the
'business" of Hamlet's re-entrance. But why shouldn't there be
here, prior to the return of Hamlet, a re-entrance of the Second
Gravedigger, as if coming back from friend YAUGHAN's with the pot
of ale? The sight of this would attract First Gravedigger, and take
the thirsty soul most readily from his work to discuss the refreshment
in some shady nook. Then by all means let Hamlet
return to pour out
his grief; and on this picture ought the Curtain effectively descend.

I have been looking for you everywhere.
Jones. Then I am delighted to have met you.
Brown. I have said of you that you are a trickster, a scoundrel, a
fool, and an idiot!
Jones. Yes—and I have regretted the saying, because it shows
to me that you have misunderstood the great literary movement of
the present day, in its vast and varied effort.
Brown. Of that I know nothing, for I confess I have never read
your books.
Jones (reproachfully). Yes—and yet you accuse me of being a
trickster, a scoundrel, and
a fool, without knowing my works?
Brown. It was my duty. But still I had no wish to be guilty
of an outrage.
Jones. An outrage-how an outrage ?

haystack with their swords! And this is life in the Army !
Chair. Were you arrested on discovery?
Wit. No; they spared me that indignity! They saw, my Lord,
that my mother was dying, and respectfully fell back while i

they were men. In spite of their red patrol jackets, brass helmets,
and no spurs, they were men, my Lord,-men! And, as soldiers,
after I had broken from prison, and was accused of murder, they
again released me, because some one promised to buy my discharge!
Chair. And where are you quartered ?

have these strange experiences of discipline, and where I am enlisted

Bonnets on the South-Eastern.”—Mr. Barry Pain, “In the

EARTH has not anything to show less fair :

A twenty minutes' wait amidst the cry
Of churlish clowns who worn cord jackets wear,
Without one single, solitary swear.
The low, unmeaning grunt, the needless lie,
The prompt“ next platform” (which is all my eye),
The choky waiting-room, the smoky air;
Refreshment-bars where nothing nice they keep,
Whose sandwich chokes, whose whiskey makes one ill;
The seatless platforms! Ne'er was gloom so deep!
The truck tоe-crusheth at its own sweet will.
Great Scott! are pluck and common-sense asleep,

names is to be found in an announcement of a forth-

evening of May 11, to be given by Mr. CHARLES REDDIE

“A. TAYLOR'S REDDIE-made Concert.” If REDDIE-

With Woman's form and features.
Woman? We know her slavish thrall
To the strange sway despotical
Of that strong figment, Fashion ;
But is there nought in this to move
The being born for grace and love
To shamed rebellious passion ?
'Tis a she-shape by Mode arrayed !
The dove that coos in verdant shade,
The lark that shrills in ether,
The humming-bird with jewelled wings, –
Ten thousand tiny songful things
Have lent her plume and feather.
They die in hordes that she may fly,
A glittering horror, through the sky.
Their voices, hushed in anguish,
Find no soft echoes in her ears,
Or the vile trade in pangs and fears
Her whims support would languish.
What cares she that those wings were torn
From shuddering things, of plumage shorn
To make her plumes imposing ?
That when-for her-bird-mothers die,
Their broods in long-drawn agony
Their eyes-for her-are closing ?
What cares she that the woods, bereft
Of feathered denizens, are left
To swarming insect scourges ?

COURT CARDS.
A SPLENDID hand is just now held by Mr. ARTHUR CHUDLEIGH,
Sole Lessee and Manager of the Court Theatre. Full of trumps,
honours and odd tricks. A perfect entertainment in three pieces.
You pay your money and you take your choice. You can come in at
8.15 and see The Nero Sub, by SEYMOUR HICKS (Brayvo, 'Icks! and
may your success be Hickstraordinary !) or at 9:15 for W. S. GILBERT'S
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, or at 10 for A Pantomime Rehearsal,
which, as I remarked long ago on seeing it for the first time, might
last for ever if only judiciously refreshed, say, once in every three
months, and on this plan it might continue until it should be played
in 1992 by the great-great-grandchildren of the members of the
present company.
There is one charming line in the bill-a bill which, on account of
its colour, must be taken as red”-not to be missed by visitors.
It comes immediately after the cast of The New Sub; it is this,

* shut up,”-much to the delight of King and Court. But, the
question remains, why did SHAKSPEARE ever put this speech to the
players in Hamlet's mouth ? My theory is, that he did not want
BURBAGE to play the part, but couldn't help ủimself, and so, out
of pure revenge, he introduced this speech in which he makes
BURBAGE himself condemn all his own faults. Later on the Queen
describes Hamlet as "fat and scant of breath,” which certainly was
not the author's ideal Prince of Denmark; and this is evidently inter-
polated as
a nasty one" for BURBAGE. At the Court Theatre the
skit is capitally played all round, though I confess I should have
preferred seeing Hamlet made up as a sort of fat and flabby Chad-
band puffing and wheezing,-an expression, by the way, that suggests
another excellent performer in this part, namely, Mr. HERMANN
WHEEZIN', who might be induced to appear after a lot of "puffin'.”
Finally, A Pantomime Rehearsal is still about the very funniest
thing to be seen in any London Theatre at the present time. The
ladies are, all of them, as the old gentleman in Pink Dominoes used
to say, "Pretty dears!” They dance charmingly, especially Miss
ELLALINE TERRISS and Miss DECIMA MOORE, whose two duets and
character-dances are things of joy for ever. The representative of
Jack Deedes, Barrister-at-Law and Gifted Author, is LITTLE and
good, and the services of Mr. DRAYCOTT as the Lime-Light Comedian
are invaluable. WEEDON GROSSMITH and BRANDON THOMAS are
better than ever : their duet is immense, but their combat is too
short. Why not introduce a Corsican Brothers duel? The music,
by Mr. EDWARD JONES, is thoroughly appropriate and very catching.

Look 'ere, John, you stow it; you're nuts on the spoutin';
I don't mind a man as can 'oller a bit;
And if shillings are goin', I'd back you for shoutin',
Though your game's an Aunt Sally, all miss and no 'it.
But the blusterin' chap as keeps naggin' the boys on
To fight and get beat all for nothing's an ass.
And I'm certain o' this, that the wust kind o' poison
Is the stuff as you fellers ’ave lots of-that's gas !
What's Orme done to you ? 'E can't'elp a cove bettin'.
To get at’im for that is a trifle too warm.

And I'll throw BENNY TILLETT and one or two more in,

Well, 'e knows what it is, for I'll lay 'e's bin there.

If you don't want to bust and go pop like a bladder,
Why you'd best take my tip-put 'em both in a bag.
So ta-ta, JOHN. I ain't the least wish to offend you,
But plain words to fellers like you is the best.
If they'd give me my way, why I'd jolly soon end you,
Beard, blather and all; you're no more than a pest.

with him. Only suspicious thing about him is, his extreme desire
to keep out of sight. When SPEAKER took Chair he was standing
at Bar surveying House, and wondering when it would be made.
As soon as MATTINSON rose to move Second Reading of Bill,
FORWOOD, so to speak, went backward, and planted himself well in
shadow of SPEAKER'S Chair.
Turns out in course of interesting Debate that, though the speech
on moving Second Reading is the voice of MATTINSON, the Bill is the
Bill of FORWOOD, whose interest in the political affairs of Liverpool
is said to be extensive and peculiar. NEVILLE puts it in another
way. “Whenever,” he said, "any political manipulation is afoot in
Liverpool, be sure the Secretary to the Admiralty will not be far away."
At first, FORWOOD affected indifference to proceedings. "His
Bill! s'elp him, never seen it before. L'pool.' What's that?"
But as Debate went forward, and gentlemen opposite insisted on
dragging him in, he finally yielded, and taking off coat, "went for”
other side. Rev. SAM SMITH interposed with charming story about
a gentleman whom Liverpool Tories had appointed Chairman of
Watch Committee," he being solicitor to the two largest publicans
in Liverpool.” That didn't at first sight seem much to point, sup-
posing even the united cubit measurement of the worthy tradesmen
exceeded twelve feet. But Reverend Sam went on to explain what
he meant was that, “ between them, they owned about 120 public-
houses.” Curious movement in Strangers' Gallery as of involuntary
smacking of many lips. FORWOOD said this (which he daintily
alluded to as an allegation”) had been denied. SAM, couching
the retort in clerical language, said in effect, You're another!
whereupon Ministerialists roared, “Oh! oh!” and FORWOOD, now
thoroughly roused, proceeded to show that SAMUEL and his Liberal
allies were the real Gerrymanders, and that he, FORWOOD, was the
spotless advocate of the true interests of the Working-Man.
House began to look askance on S. S. Never suspected him of
being a man of that kind. Glad when painful discussion came to
end. Bill read Second Time; but jubila-
tion of promoters suddenly chilled by TIM

(Suggested by certain recent manifestations of the
Nonconformist conscience.)
Thou shalt not steal! That's a command
Which grips us with an iron hand;
And "he who prigs what isn't his'n,
When he is cotched shall go to prison !”
So runs the Cockney doggerel, Clear
If ungrammatical, austere,
With not a saving clause to qualify
Its rigid Spartan rule, or modify
Theft's Nemesis. Thou shalt not steal !
At least, -ahem !-well, all must feel
That property in thoughts and phrases,
The verbal filagree that raises
Flat fustian into “oratory,”
And makes the pulpit place of glory,
Such property is not so easy
To settle, and a conscience queasy
O'er picking pockets, oft remains
Quite unperturbed while picking brains !
A Sermon is not minted coin;
It you may borrow, buy, purloin,
In part or wholly, and yet preach it
As your own work. Who'll dare impeach it,
This innocent transaction ? Not

Breeds such unquestioning community
Of property-in Sermons ? True it

as anyone can see who will take the trouble to glance through my
earlier advices!”—these will be difficult to find, as they were only
conveyed in private letters which will not be published until my
biography is written later on !-(very much, I hope). Still, had I
pursued the ordinary course of trying to tip the Winner, Sir Hugo
would undoubtedly have been my sole selection-a fact which should
not fail to weigh with my followers—and I have followers in plenty,
as Lord ARTHUR knows !
Having done the whole of Epsom week, I shall be glad of a rest to
get ready for Ascot-(four new gowns to try on)--and besides there
are some smart parties to attend next week, so Doncaster will not be
blessed with my sweet presence. However, I have a friend there on
the Press who can be trusted. So, in concluding this letter with
my selection for the last horse in the Manchester Cup, I am able to
recommend it very strongly, as my friend will do the placing; and
as I am not there, no collusion can be suspected!
I must just mention that among the shows provided on Epsom
Downs for the entertainment of the multitude, was one which I
should like to see done away with, namely, the so-called "glove
contests"-which to my mind are not calculated to advance "Eng-
land's greatness" nor are they pleasing to look on at. The "abolition
of Slavin(g)” is undoubtedly a fine thing, but is hardly perhaps an
unmixed blessing when it makes
heroes of Dusky Warriors !
I hear from my friend Major CLEMENT that we are going to have
a most successful Ascot in spite of the regrettable absence of Royalty;
indeed he could have let all the Boxes twice over-and as I shall be

The street, the hall its echoes now

STUDIES IN THE NEW POETRY.
No. II.
MR. PUNCA's first example of the New Poetry was, it may be
remembered, in the rhymed, irregular style. It is not a difficult
style. The lines may be long or short; some may groan under an
accumulation of words, while others consist of merely two or three-
a most unfair distribution. The style of the following specimen
(also by Mr. H-NL-Y) is, however, even easier to manage. There
are no rhymes and very few restrictions. The lines are very short,
and a few words, therefore, go a very long way, which is always a
consideration, even if you don't happen to be paid by the column.
This style is very fierce and bloodthirsty and terrible. Timid people
are, therefore, advised, for the sake of their nerves, not to read any

asks himself if it won't be as well, or “ better, to open his byrnie ?”
Those among the audience who have been carefully reading the trans-

proceedings, being evidently uncertain as to what “his byrnie" may
be. Some clever person in Stalls observes that up to now, he has
always thought that byrnie' was the affectionate diminutive for
a mountain byrne'in Scotland." Which clever person had evidently
much to learn. However the effect of the operation for "byrnie
(which ought to have been performed by Dr. BYBNIE YEo, ever
ready to rescue a fellow-creature in distress) is to show that the
supposed Knight is a Lady; Whereupon Siegfried with “surprise
and astonishment starts back ” exclaiming :

MY DEAR MARY,
Algebra Lodge.
As you are many weeks my junior (to be precise, exactly
two months), I hasten to answer your letter. I have searched all
my Biographical Dictionaries, but cannot find the people of whom
you are in search. As for myself, I have never heard of Bluebeard,
know nothing of The Sleeping Beauty, and am sceptical of the exist-
ence of Sindbad and Jack the Giant-Killer. Like Mrs. Prig, who
doubted the existence of Mrs. Harris, "I don't believe there were
no such persons.” By the way, you ought to read DICKENS. He is
distinctly funny, and I can quite understand his amusing our grand-
mothers. I generally turn to his
works after a long day with HOMER
or EURIPIDES.
