SCENE—Chicago. Mr. Pusch seated, like Manius, not howerer amidst Carthaginian ruins, but amidst the colossal, though
incomplete, evidences of "the grand style, the perfect proportions, and the magnificent dimensions of the buildings of the
World's .Columbian Exposition.” To him enters a Majestic Presence, bearing an Eagle, falcon-like, on her fist.
Mr. Punch (rising and saluting). Hail, COLUMBIA !
Toby (greeting the Bird of Freedom). Bow-wow-wow!
Eagle (affably). Squ-a-a-a-kkk !!!
Columbia (with an Olympian air, and a slight accent). Tha-a-anks, and welcome, Stranger! When I say “ Stranger,"
I don't mean that you are one. But it is a delicate compliment to a Britisher to adopt, in some small measure, the quaint
diction with which his wandering wags credit me. I ought to have said “ air" instead of " are," and to have already dropped
in an “I reckon " or two. But I 'm sure your politeness will hold me excused of that !
Mr. Punch. Madam, there is no need to carry the conventionalities of international caricature into the courtesies of
internatior al intercourse.
Columbia. Well said, Mr. PUNCII! Shake! And be seated. [They sit, whilst AQUILA hops down to hob-nob with TOBY.
Afr. Punch (admiringly). COLUMBIA, you look particularly fit and high-toned to-day. Like-how shall I put it?-
well, like an extremely up-to-date Juno, out for an airing with the Bird of Jove.
Columbia. Comparisons are—fragrant, from your truthful lips. Never mind me, however, just now. What do you
thiuk of my Big Show-as far as it goes ?
Mr. Punch. That, unfinished as is its condition, it bear3 the promise and potency of licking all Creation-in the
exhibiting line. Even that colossal conglomeration in the Champs de Mars was scarcely a circumstance to what I see around
me here. England had the credit of starting the game, France trumped her last card, but Chicago “ clears the board."
Colunbia. Now then, AQUILA, leave Toby's tail alone! A fine fowl, Mr. Pusch, but rather fond of mischief.
Mr. Punch. Just a touch of the magpie strain, eh? I fancy I've noticed it before-once or twice. Toby won't
mind. He knows Birds o' Freedom are apt to take liberties,
Columbia (smiling). Mr. Poxca-you do beat all-out of sight!
“ Who is it dares say thet our naytional eagle
Wun't much longer be classed with the birds thet air regal ?".
I ought to resent your sly suggestion ! But, like Toby, I'm good-tempered, and sha'n't.
DIr. Punch. Madam, you disarm me! The Bird 's a beauty, and I'm a brute. [Pats AQUILA's proud crest paternally.

Columbia. Stars and Stripes ! He doesn't peck you !!
MIr. Punch. He knows I love him and his Mistress. Let the jays of Journalism chatter, the finches of Fashion
flutter, and the kites and crows of Party claw and scuflle,-Leo and AQUILA are not " in that crowd."
Columbia. That's so, and don't you forget it !
Mr. Punch. I won't-even when Jim BLAINE blusters, M'KISLEY crows, HARRISON eggs on Canada to revolt, high
tariffs threaten our interests, or long quarantines our comfort.
Columbia. Nor I when emigration agents dump down your human refuse on my shores, or your callow cocky KIPLINGS
mock my institutions, and run a-muck at my manners, till I'm tempted to say with “ IIosea BIGLow”—
“Of all the sarse thet I can call to mind,
England doos mak the most onpleasant kind."
Mr. Punch (smiling). Quits ! Well, COLUMBIA, I 'm infinitely interested in your imminent Exhibition-I beg pardon,
Exposition ! I trust the other (theoretically) imminent things, such as the threatened Strikes, Epidemics, Preposterous
Prices, and other public nuisacces, will not interfere with its complete prosperity, or hinder its achieving the pyramidal
success I most heartily wish it.
Columbia. Thanks ! I'm not quite sure, Mr. Punch, that Lowell's nobly hospitable words, so often quoted, apply
now quite as forcibly as once they did :-
“An' whose free latch-string never was drawed in
Aginst the poorest child O' ADAM's kin."
Humph! You see HOMER WILBUR, A.M. " didn't know everythin' down in "-Jaalam! And my dear, high-souled JAMES
RUSSELL perhaps lived just long enough to suspect that the policy of the ring-feuce night have to supersede that of the “ free
latch-string," after all. But you 'll be welcome, Mr. Puxco, you and your Young Men, if you can manage to run them across
to Chicago, as you did to the Champs de Marz.
Nr. Punch. Ah! It's a fir cry from Fleet Street to Lake Michigan, Madam. But I 'll tell them what you say.
One of them—a “ dear clever boy,” bearing a famous name that is well beknown to you-has lately paid you a llying visit,
and is about to tell the wo:ld, with pen and pencil, what he thinks of you.
Corumbia (sighing). Ah! They all do it! Mex O'Rell, Fursiss, Kipling, it's all the same. They 're awfully
anxious I should see myself as others sce me—in a few weeks. But somehow, Mr. PUNCII, dear BRITANNIA and I do not
always quite recognise ourselves in the perhaps slightly distorting mirrors held up to Nature by caricaturists on either
side the herring-pond.
Mr. Punch. Well, Columbia, humour, like poetry, does not always bear translation -- or transatlanticisation. Britishers
and Yankces are much given to mutually contemning each other's comicalities. Much that strikes as smart or laughable on
one side the Atlantic, may seem coarse or dull on t'other. You see we don't fully understand each other's politics, especially
in their personal details, and there are local fashions in fun as in other things. Still, one touch of genuine free humour-
like one touch of Nature—should make the whole world kin, much more you and me, who are nature's kindred already. 'Tis
in the hope, my dear COLUMBIA, that you may find in its pages a few such touches of Nature—as I am sure you will find no
intentional touches of ill-nature, to you-wards particularly—'lis in that hope, and with heartiest wishes for the c mplete

UNOPPOSED ELECTION.
On Saturday last, being the first day permissible under the statute,
the nomination of a Knight to serve in Parliament for the Shire of
Barks, was held in the county town. The proceedings were marked
by a pleasing unanimity, and an outburst of popular enthusiasm
which seriously tried the resources of the local police. There was
only one candidate-TOBY once more M.P. The nomination paper
was signed by Mr. Punch, Mr. GLADSTONE, Lord SALISBURY, and
most of the Crowned Heads of Europe.
The Sheriff inquired if it were desired to nominate any other
Gentleman. (A Voice" I should think not!") There being no
other response, the Sheriff declared the Hon. Gentleman duly elected,
and said he would like to be permitted to forego his fees, if indeed
any were due.
In response to loud calls from the assembled crowd, Mr. Punch
said he had great pleasure in recommending his young friend to
the suffrages of this important constituency. (Cheers.) He called
him young, for though he had been on his (Mr. Punch's) establish-
ment for over fifty years, he was very little altered. There were
some people who never grew old (A Voice—“ Bully for you, Mr.
Punch!”) and amongst them he might include his faithful follower,
whom they had just unanimously re-elected Member for Barks.
He trusted that in the future, bis young friend would pursue the
course honourably followed by him in the past. (“ Hear! Hear!!”) THE IMPORTANCE OF EXTERNALS.
This was the fourth Parliament to which he had been elected, and he
trusted it would not be the last. (Cheers.) He might perhaps allude

had the authority of Toby, M.P., to say that, as far as his freedom
to retain their confidence and to serve them and posterity to the
utmost extent of his power and opportunity. (Disturbance at
the rear of the hall ; cries of "Put him out !” “Sit on 'is 'ead!”).
Mr. Punch begged they would do no such thing. It would be sure
to give way under pressure. (Laughter.) In conclusion, he begged
to thank them for the honour they had done his friend, and he might
add, themselves.
There were loud cries for TOBY, M.P., but the Hon. Member
begged to be excused from making a speech on this occasion. For
one reason he shrank from coming into competition in the lists of
platform-speaking with his revered friend and Leader. Another
thing was, he was really so overcome by the honour just done him,
that he could not trust himself to speak. He would write - as soon
as the new Parliament met.
After the customary votes of thanks had been carried by acclama-
tion, the new Member was hoisted shoulder-high by the enthusiastic
mob, and carried off to his country residence, The Kennel, Barks,
where he will remain during the Recess.

that of all known preserves, strawberry-jam is both the
best, and the most sustaining. I should disgrace myself
if I were now, at the eleventh hour, to declare a pre-
ference which I do not honestly feel for gooseberry or
raspberry.”
This, of course, settled the matter. Mr. TUFFAN
declared emphatically against the obnoxious strawberry;
and the result was that the Association, by an enormous
majority, decided to support him. The Liberals were at
first much discouraged, but they have now taken heart
again. One of their Canvassers, it seems, has succeeded
in making himself a persona grata to a lady who occupies
the position of under-housemaid in the establishment
of the TUFFANS. Through her he obtained an empty pot
of strawberry-jam, lately consumed by the TUFFAN
family. This has been fixed upon a long pole, with a
placard underneath it, to the following effect:-
TAKEN FROM TUFFAN'S TABLE!
VOTE FOR PLEDGER, AND HONEST CONVICTIONS!
And the device is now being carried all over the Town by
the Junior Liberal Association.
The polling takes place to-morrow. Both sides are
confident, but, on the whole, after reviewing all the cir-
cumstances of the case as impartially as possible, taking
into account everything that tells for or against both
parties, and not forgetting the effect produced by the
public secession of Mr. HONEYDEW, the tobacconist, and
Ex-President of the Liberal 500, I am disposed to believe
in the victory of Mr. PLEDGER; that is to say, unless Mr.

votes to defeat his opponent.

and a Baronetcy for the Lord MAYOR."
“And yet,” 'pondered the New Zealander, “I was
certainly informed by wire, that the glory of Britain had
vanished for ever."
“Very likely an Election cry," observed Mr. Punch.
“In the midst of a contested polling, both sides think
the success of their rivals must be followed by imme-
diate disaster. But somehow or other, things settle
down afterwards, and nothing comes of it. Which-
ever side wins, the old flag floats in the wind as gaily
and as prosperously as ever.”
“And yet I was certainly told that the sun of Eng-
land had set never to rise again," persisted the Aborigi-
nal, who seemed to be of an obstinate turn of mind.
“ Now I remember—the cause was something to do with
Diamonds and Henley. Stay, the bright brains of the
nation had disappeared. I recollect, the Diamond Sculls
of the nation (once so great) had passed to foreigners."
"Ah, now I take your meaning." said the National Repre-
sentative, with a smile," and you must have heard of the
result of the race for the Diamond Sculls at Henley."
“That must be it,” acquiesced the New Zealander. “I
had forgotten to take into account possible errors in trans-
mission. But tell me, has there been a national defeat?”
“Well, yes," admitted Mr. Panch, with a sigh-
"we did not come out altogether satisfactorily. Even
the second man was a Frenchman-albeit, his name was
suggestive of dear old Scotland.”_
" And do you mean to say," said the New Zealander,
“that the best scullers of England were beaten by a
boating-man from the Seine ?"
“It is too true, and the Frenchman himself succumbed
to a Dutchman-yes, we confess it, and with shame."
"I don't see why you should,” returned the other,
changing his tone to one of greater satisfaction. “As a
New Zealander, I observe nothing degrading in the
superiority of 'Old Holland." And considering the
prowess of VAN TROMP in the past, there was perhaps
nothing so strange in the triumph of Ooms in the present.

OH, lovely flower sent from afar,
Like sunlight to this world of ours,
What art thou but a golden star,
A priceless gem amongst the flowers ?
Alas, all earthly things must die,
Thou, too, fair yellow flower must fade,
Thou wilt not charm an Artist's eye,
Upon the breast of some fair maid !
Ah, no, thine is a nobler fate,
Unlike the lily or the rose, :
Thou passest to a higher state
When in sad death thy petals close :
For then thine outward form, grown pale
Is changed to what, at first scarce seen,
Is still thyself, so fair, so frail,
A little fruit of tender green!
When quite matured, how very choice
Thy juicy flavour ; who can then
Sing all thy worth with mortal voice,
Or write thy praise with mortal pen!

And shout, with loud discordant sound,

And lashing the billows to him is true life;
Behold how he buffets and scourges them!
Chase him? The Captain (though also a Kaiser),
Might think that his course to avoid him were wiser,
Until sheer necessity urges them.
And yet whales are beaten-by narwhals and men,
And other mere pigmies. 'Tis said, now and then,
E'en sword-fish can compass their ruin,
By stabbing together-in Cassius's way
With Cæsar. Leviathan, dead, is a prey
To dog-fish, and sea-birds, or Bruin.
There he blows! There he goes! Would an amateur Whaler,
Like WILHELM, that fine blend of Statesman and Sailor,
Incline to the chase and the capture
Of such a huge, wandering, wallopping whale,
To whom “Troubling the waters" with blow-holes and tail
Seems a source of such riotous rapture ?

DUST AND HASHES.
SIR,-When I first took my present house, I was
advised to get a Sanitary Dust-bin, instead of the old
brick one which existed in my back-yard. One of the
blessings predicted for my Sanitary Dust-bin, was, that
it was easily removable." I find this to be the case.
It has already been removed by some area-sneak, and as I
have got rid of the old brick dust-bin, the Vestry
threaten to prosecute me for creating a nuisance, be-
cause my dust is now placed in a corner under my front
steps. What am I to do 1-AGGRIEVED HOUSEHOLDER.
SIR, I find that the law recently passed against tips
to Dustmen is quite unknown-at all events, to the
Dustmen themselves. My servants, I find, go on freely
bribing these functionaries, to remove bones and vege-
table refuse. Their rate of tipping, as far as I can make
out, is about a halfpenny per bone. If I were now to
enforce the law and forbid tips, I foresee that the Dust-
carts would have pressing business elsewhere, and would
visit me about once a month. Then would follow a
régime of." big, big, D.8”-in the window-which would
be intolerable. I prefer tipping to typhoid.
Yours long sufferingly, VICTIM OF THE VESTRIES.
SIR,-The Vestry is quite right to insist on every house
burning up its own odds and ends. The true domestic
motto is—“Every kitchen its own crematorium.” I do
this habitually, out of public spirit. It is true that a
sickening odour permeates the house for an hour or two
of every day, created by the combustion of dinner rem-
nants; also that most of my family suffer from bad sore
throats, which they attribute to this cause. What of
that? The truly good Citizen will prefer to poison himself
rather than his neighbours. A CLERKENWELL Caro.
SIR, I recently purchased Dodger's Digest of Dustbin
Law, and recommend it to the perusal of every house-
holder. In the case of The Vestry of Shoreditch v.
Grimes, Lord Justice SLUSH remarks — “The Vestry
complains that the Defendant's bin was improperly
covered ; that, in fact, it was not under coverture. To
this the Defendant replies that his bin was void ab initio,
as there was nothing in it. Then the question arises
whether the Defendant's Cook was justified in tipping
the Dustman into the empty bin, considering that the
Legislature has distinctly forbidden tips of all kinds to
Dustmen. I am of opinion that the Cook was the De-
fendant's agent, and that the rule of qui facit per alium
facit per se applies here. The Cook's proceeding was
undoubtedly tortious; it was not a criminal action,

“REMOTE, unfriended, melancholy slow,
Or by the lazy Scheldt, or wandering Po?"
Nay, gentle GOLDSMITH, it is thus no more,
None now need fear“ the rude Carinthian boor,"

Or e'en the predatory Bedouin.

Our thoughts, great Agent, must revert to thee.
From Parthenon or Pyramid, we look

Eternal blessings crown the wanderer's friend!

Who do in marshalled hosts the Regular Round;

The heights of Athens, or the walls of Rome,
Then like flock-folded sheep, are shepherded safe home.

Survey mankind from China to Peru.”
By all means, yes, or even further fare,
And Afric's forest huge and poisonous Pigmies dare.
But, to avoid the lonely traveller's pain,
From Ludgate Circus drag the well-linked chain;
As Amurath to Amurath succeeds,
So Cook to Cook! THOMAS's grandiose deeds

But his vast enterprise shall still march on.

The Eight Hours' people were at me next. I said I
saw that the Bill would provide employment for a number
of people, but I added, that I did not see who was to pay
the wages, nor who was to buy the goods. For, I re-
marked, you certainly cannot compete with foreign
countries at this rate, and at home the Classes will be
competing with you, being obliged to have recourse to
manual labour. They said that was just what they
wanted, everybody to labour with his hands. I answered
that many of the Classes, a poor lot at best (cheers),
would come on the Parish. Who was to pay the rates
when everybody was working, and nobody was buying
what was made? If there were no markets, where were
you to sell your produce? They said they would live
on the land. I answered that the land would not sup-
port the population: you would need to import bread-
stuffs, with what were you going to pay for them? I
added that my heart was with them, but that they could
only attain their ends by massacring or starving three-
fourths of the population, and who knew how he him-
self might fare, with a three-to-one chance against his
survival ? Suppose it did not come to that, I urged,
suppose the Bill gave all the world employment; suppose
that, somehow, it also paid their wages, or supported
them, in a very short time you would need a Four Hours'
Bill (cheers), a Two Hours' Bill, a One Hour's Bill, of
course with no fall in wages. The constitution of things
would not run to it.
They said that I had clearly not fought out the econo-
mic aspect of the question. I said that was how my hair
was blanched, with trying to fight it out, but that,
somehow, it always baffled me. I added remarks about
squaring the circle, but they said it was a good deal
easier to square Mr. GLADSTONE. The friends of Total

Robert Lowe, Piscount Sherbrooke.

BORN, 1811. DIBD, JULY 27, 1892.
GREAT fighter of lost causes, gone at last!
A meteoric course, by shade o'ercast
Long ere its close, was thine. A star that slips
At brightest into shadow of eclipse,
Leaves watchers waiting for its flaming forth
In a renewed refulgence. Wit and worth,
Satire and sense, courage and judgment keen,
Were thine. What flaw of weakness or of spleen,
What lack of patience or persistence, doomed
Thee to too early darkness? Seldom bloomed
So sudden-swift a flower of fame as thine,
When BRIGHT and GLADSTONE led the serried line
Of resolute reformers to the attack,
And dauntless Dizzy strove to bear them back.
Then rose “ White-headed BOB," and foined and smote,
Setting his slashing steel against the throat
Of his old friends, and wrung from them applause.
The champion was valiant, though the cause
Was doomed to failure, and betrayal. Yes!
The subtle Chief thus aided in the press
By an ally so stalwart, turned and rent
The flag he fought for, and the valour spent
In its defence by thee, was wasted all.
Yet 'twas a sight when, back against the wall,
White-headed BOB would wield that flashing blade,
That BRIGHT scarce parried, and that GLADSTONE stayed
Only with utmost effort.
Yes, 'twill live
In record, that fierce fight, and radiance give
Through Time's dense mist, when lesser stars grow dim,
And though the untimely ermine silenced him,
The clear and caustic critic, though no more,
That rhetoric, like the Greek's, now “ fulmined o'er"
Democracy's low flats, but silent sank
In those dull precincts dedicate to Rank;
A SATISFACTORY PATIENT.
Still its remembered echoes shall resound,
For he with honour, if not love, was crowned,

And has a feller-feeling.
About the parish must I trot?

Yes, by a co-in-side-ance queer,

For where is the man would strike the lyre,
Or spurn with his foot the thief,
My language, like my hat, flew free?
Or melt all day,
Away in swift pursuit I dashed,
In a Midsummer way,
The hat went scudding fast before ;
At the sight of repentant grief?
By Busmen mocked, by Hansoms splashed,
The more I ran, it flew the more.

While boys screeched forth, in chorus vile,
Where my feet may play in the breeze,

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Thursday, August 4.-
New Parliament met to-day in great force.
Ambition stirs noble minds in different ways.
Some embark on Parliamentary life with de-
termination to outshine BRIGHT or GLADSTONE
in field of oratory. Others will not be pacified
till they emulate Pitt. Others again aim at
the lofty pedestal on which stands through
the ages the man who is first in his place, on
first day, of first Session, of new Parliament.
Exciting race to-day. At night, both Big-
WOOD and SPENCER (not BOBBY, who has
affairs of graver State to look to just now)
sailed in together. At a quarter to ten
SAVORY turned up, sermon in hand, and found
he was forestalled.
“What, MOORE of them !” cried SAVORY.
“The bane of my life.”
“Yes," said Logan, arriving a few minutes
later; "wherever there's one SAVORY you 're
sure to find MOORE, and in this case they
precede you."
Six minutes later Dixon-HARTLAND arrived,
mopping his forehead. When he found
others on spot, pretended he'd only looked in
accidentally, "Passing by, you know;
thought I'd see how old place looked.” But
it wouldn't do. Other men, especially Big-
WOOD, saw through it all. Then Dixon
HARTLAND grew anecdotal. Told fabulous
story about imaginary Scotch Member, who,
at opening of Parliament of 1880, brought
down his plaid, a stoup of whiskey, and a
thimbleful of oatmeal. *Camped out all night
in Palace Yard, and staggered into House as
soon as doors were opened
"That beats you, BigWOOD,” the Evesham
Banker said, with a tartness of voice that
betrayed his chagrin.
Rest of the 665 Members content to look in
later. By one o'clock House full, Lobby over-
flowing. "Difficult to move through the close
ranks, and yet there were many gaps. Ranks
of old House more than decimated. “There

RATHER APPROPRIATE.
UNDER the heading “Military Education,"
there appears in The Tablet, an advertise-
ment concerning preparation for examina-
tions at Woolwich and Sandhurst by “the
Rev. E. VON ORSBACH, F.R.G.S., F.R. Hist.s.,
late Tutor to their Highnesses the Princes of
THURN-AND-Taxis.” What a suggestive
name for a tutor preparing young men for a
Cavalry Regiment is "Von ORSBACH!” Not
only would pupils surmount all difficulties of
EUCLID's propositions, but being brought up
by VON ORSBACH, they would dare all
"riders!” Then as to the Princes, his pupils,
cannot we conceive of the first Prince THURN
how he has been turned out a perfect ’orseman
by Von ORSBACH, and how it would tax all an
Examiner's ingenuity to pluck Taxis. Pity
that when one Prince was called Taxis the
other wasn't named RATES. But evidently
this was an oversight. A neat couplet might
head this advertisement, and add to its attrac-
tiveness, as for instance:-
Every question, whatever they ax is,
n its THURN be answered by Taxis.
Taxis and THURN, for a win you'll of course back,
The pick of the stable, the trainer Von ORSBACH.'
We wish him a continuance of the successes
which, from his list, this Equestrian Military
Tutor-he can't be a “coach” as he is an
ORSBACH-has already obtained. It's a German
name, but it sounds more like 'Orsetrian (!)
Cur Bono ? -“It is a mistake," quoth
The World last week, " to suppose that
Mr. GLADSTONE complacently regards Sir
WILLIAM HARCOURT as his Alter Ego.'”
Mr. G. being the “Ego,” it is not very likely
that Sir WILLIAM V. HARCOURT is likely
to “alter” any of his Leader's plans. Still
an “ Alter Ego” is very useful whenever
Mr. GLADSTONE may want to "wink The
Other 1."
They're darker than of yore.
Avaunt! I'd be forgetting

ELECTION AGONIES.
(By a Re-elected M.P.)
Yes, there I stood beside my wife,
And called it-whilst the mob cheered
wildly-
"The proudest moment of my life,"
Which it was not, to put it mildly.
Heavens, how they cheered! Up went their
caps,
To see their Member safely seated;
Who in his inmost soul, perhaps,
Had almost wished himself defeated.
The girls are pleased. And Mrs. T.,
Has fairy visions of a handle
To grace the name she shares with me;
But is the game quite worth the candle ?
Six years of unremitting work,.
Of flower-shows, bazaars, and speeches,
Of sturdy mendicants who lurk
In wait to act as sturdy leeches.
The faddists-Anti-This-and-That-
Blue-spectacled “One Vote, One Person"-
Extract a promise, prompt and pat,
The while their heads you hurl a curse on.
And in return? The dull debate,
The dreary unimportant question,
The pressure of affairs of State,
A muddled brain, a lost digestion.
Six years of it. I cannot stand
At any cost another bout of it;
But, given away on every hand,
I don't quite see how to get out of it.
Ah, happy thought! My seat is safe,
And so 'mid general adulation,
I'll rescue some poor party waif
By Chiltern Hundreds resignation.
The world will quickly roar applause,
Of martyrs I shall be the latest;
But I'm the party and the cause
To whom the service will be greatest !

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
ONE of the Baron's " Merry Men All” has
been reading and enjoying Mr. BARRY PAIN's
Stories and Interludes. The book has a
wondrously weird and heavily-lined picture
in front, which is just a little too like a
“Prophetic Hieroglyphic”in Zadkiel's Alma-
nack. An emaciated and broken-winged
devil is apparently carrying an engine-hose
through a churchyard, whilst a bat flits
against a curious sky, which looks like a
young grainer's first attempt at imitating
"birds'-eye maple." Upon a second glance
it seems possible that the “hose” is a snake,
the tail of which the devil is gnawing. The
gruesome design illustrates a yet more grue-
some Interlude, entitled, “ The Bat and the
Devil." But it gives no fair idea of the con-
tents of the volume, some of which are
charming.
Read White Nights, stories within a story,
told by a tragical “ Fool," of the) breed of
Hugo's Rigoletto, and POE's Hopfrog-with
a difference. They are told with force and
grace, and with i unstrained, but moving
pathos. Read “The Dog That Got Found,"
a brief, sketch indeed, but abundantly sug-
gestive. Poor Fido—the "dog that got to
be utterly sick of conventionality," and came
to such bitter grief in his search for "life,
poignant and intense!” He might read a
lesson to many a two-legged prig, were the
bipedal nincompoop capable of learning it.
The Glass of Supreme Moments is, perhaps,
needlessly enigmatical, and Rural Simplicity,
Concealed Art, and Two Poets, strike one
as superfluously “uppleasant." Mr. Pain
seems slightly touched with the current
literary fad for making bricks with the
smallest possible quantity of straw. One half-
pennyworth of the bread of incident to an
intolerable deal of the sack of strained style
and pessimist commentary, make poorish
imaginative pabulum, though there seems an
increasing appetite for it amongst those
who, unlike Lucas Morne in The Glass of
Supreme Moments, plume themselves upon
possession of “the finer perceptions." The
Magic Morning is a “scrap" elaborately
auced and garnished; the fleeting flavour
may possess a certain sub-acid piquancy, but
such small dishes of broken meats are hardly
nourishing or wholesome.
Mr. Pain has a delicate fancy and a grace-
ful style, a bitter-sweet humour, and a
plentiful endowment of “the finer percep-
tions." He has done some good work here,
and will do better—when he finds his sub-
ject, and loses his affectations. Read White
Nights, again says the Baron's “retainer.”

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, Aug. 8.-
Think I mentioned, just before Prorogation,
how DUNBAR BARTON, offended at disregard
paid to his warnings by Ministers, protested
that he would never speak again, and should
thenceforth be known as Dom BARTON.
Finding him to-night figged out, prepared to
move Address, reminded him of the incident.
“Quite so, TOBY," he said ; “you 're per-
fectly right.' I never did speak again in that
House. This is a different thing. Besides,
I'm not going to make a speech, but to read
a paper.'
Rather quibbling this; but temptation to
accept invitation to move Address at opening
of new Session understood to be irresistible.

to be excused. W. 8. CROSS seconded

THE LOST JOKE.
(A Song of a Sad but Common Experience.)
AIR :-“The Lost Chord.”
SEATED one day in my study
I was listless and ill at ease,
And my fingers twiddled idly
With the novel upon my knees.
I know not where I was straying
On the poppy-clustered shore,
But I suddenly struck on a Sparkler
Which fairly made me roar.
I have joked some jokes in my time, Sir,
But this was a Champion Joke,
And it fairly cut all record
As a humoristic stroke.
It was good for a dozen of dinners,
It was fit to crown my fame
As a shaper of sheer Side-splitters,
For which I have such a name.
It flooded my spirit's twilight
Like the dawn on a dim dark lake,
For I knew that against all rivals
It would fairly take the cake."
I said I will try it to-morrow,-
I won't even tell my wife, -
It will certainly fetch Lord FUMFUDGE,
And then-I am made for life!
It links two most distant meanings
Into one perfect chime
Here my servant broke the silence,
And said it was dinner-time!
I have sought, but I seek it vainly,

but the MARKISS in his place smiling in unaf-

in Commons when the end came.
"Very odd," said PICKERSGILL, pressing
his hat to his bosom; "it seems nothing
amuses the CECILS and their family belong-
ings so much as a reverse at the Poll."
The MARKISS in such exuberant good
humour at seeing KIMBERLEY opposite to him,
could not resist temptation to try on little
joke. It was not, he said, either desirable
or usual that he, as outgoing Minister, should
say anything on present occasion. But per-
haps KIMBERLEY would oblige, and would
give House full exposition of intentions
of new Ministry with respect to foreign
and domestic affairs. KIMBERLEY gravely
answered, that not yet being Minister of the
Crown, nor having had opportunity of con-
sulting with his colleagues, he was unpre-
pared to make statement on subject.

MUSICAL NOTES.
Popping a Question.-
The Daily News, in its last
week's "Music and Musi-
cians," informs us that
“Mr. CHAPPELL has now
definitely decided that the
season of Monday Popular
Concerts shall this year
commence on a Tuesday.”
Sure then it must be Mister
O'CHAPPELL, the CHAPPELL
by the hill-side, who arran-
ges to have his first “Mon-
day Pop” on a Tuesday ?
If he be going out shooting
on his own native heath,
his name O'CHAPPELL, then
there's no reason why he
shouldn't have his first pop
on a Tuesday, only it
couldn't be his Monday
Pop, could it now? Or if he
drinks Mr. P.'s health in
Pommery '80 (grand vin!'),
or let's say Poppery '80, he
could do so on a Tuesday,
only it would no longer be
the "Monday Pop.” That's
all. Sure'tis mighty con-
fusing and upsets the week
entirely. If Tuesday is to
have all the Pop, what's to
become of Monday ? For
further particulars inquire
at the Pop-shop, Bond
Street.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

AN OLD AND NEW PEER.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-Look here!
I've done good service in my time,
and no one likes to see himself de-
prived of an honoured title, or forced
to take a back seat. I've been
trodden under-foot over and over
again-but I've borne it with forti-
tude, and never, never given way.
Now, what do I hear? That a
Gentleman, a Government Whip, for
whom I have the highest esteem and
respect, is now to assume the title
which, by right of position, place,
time, and prescription, belongs to me,
and to me only. I can bear much,
but, after so many years of devoted
service, during which, with all my
opportunities, I have never once
made any attempt to leave my
place to go higher up, or to go lower
down, or, in either case, to go with
the tide, I cannot, and, indeed, will
not, yield my title to anyone, how-
ever good and useful to his Party he
may have been, but proudly declar-
ing myself as good as any "Sprig of
Nobility,” even as this one who
cometh up as a Flower, I beg, pro-
testingly, to remind the world at
large that I am “ Nulli Secundus,"

SONGS OF SOCIETY ;
1.-INTRODUCTORY. TO MY LYRE.
[“ Smoothly written vers de Société, where a
boudoir decorum is, or ought always to be, pre-
served; where sentiment never surges into passion,
and where humour never overflows into boisterous
merriment.”—Frederick Locker's Preface to “ Lyra
Elegantiarum.”]
DEAR Lyre, your duty now you know !
If one would sing with grace and glow
Songs of Society,
One must not dream of fire, or length,
Or vivid touch, or virile strength,
Or great variety.
Among the Muses of Mayfair
A Bacchanal with unbound hair,
And loosened girdle,
Would be as purely out of place
As Atalanta in a race
O'er hedge or hurdle:
Our Muse, dear Lyra, must be trim,
Must not indulge in vagrant whim,
Of voice or vesture.
Boudoir decorum will allow
No gleaming eye, no glowing brow,
No ardent gesture.
Society, which is our theme,
Is like a well-conducted stream
Which calmly ripples.
We sing the World where no one feels
Too pungently, or hates, or steals,
Or loves, or tipples.
And should you hint that down below
The subtle siren all men know
Is hiding her face,
Some luxuries yet are left to sing,
The Opera-Box, the Row, the Ring,
And Golf, and Coaching.
Not e'en the Socialistic scare
The dandyish and the debonair
Has quite demolished;
Whilst Privilege hath still a purse,
There's yet a chance for flowing verse,
And periods polished.
If IBSEN, BELLAMY, and GEORGE,
Raise not the boudoir critic's gorge
Beyond all bearing,
Light lyrics may she not endurs,
On social ills above her cure,
Below her caring ?
Muse, with Society we may toy
Without impassioned grief or joy,
Or boisterous merriment;
May sing of Sorrow with a smile;
At least, it may be worth our while
To try the experiment.

his admirers have asserted that Britain
ought to have more than one Laureate, and
that Mr. A-FR-D A-ST-N ought to be among
the number. Others are not prepared to go
quite so far. They have been heard to com-
plain that cows and trees, and woodmen and
farms, and sheep and wains, and hay and
turnips, do not necessarily suggest the
highest happiness, and that it is not always
dignified for an aspiring Poet to be led
about helpless through the byeways of sense
by those wilful, wanton playfellows, his
rhymes. The two factions may be left to
tight out their quarrel over the present
example, which, by the way, is not taken
from the collected edition of the Poet's
works.
IS LUNCH WORTH ,LUNCHING ?
(By A-fr-d A-st-n.)
Is Lunch worth lunching ? Go, dyspeptic
man,
Where in the meadows green the oxen
munch.
Is it not true that since our land began
The hornéd ox hath given us steaks for
lunch?
Steaks rump or otherwise, the prime sirloin,
Sauced with the stinging radish of the horse.
Beeves meditate and die; we pay our coin,
And though the food be often tough and
coarse,
We eat it, we, through whose bold British
veins
Bold British hearts drive bubbling British
blood.
No true-born Briton, come what may, disdains
To eat the patient chewers of the cud.
Or seek the uplands, where of old Bo Peep
(So runs the tale) lost all her fleecy flocks;
There happy shepherds tend their grazing
sheep
(Some men like mutton, some prefer the ox).
Ay, surely it would need a heart of flint
To watch the blithe lambs caper o'er the lea,
And, watching them, refrain from thoughts
of mint,
Of new potatoes, and the sweet green pea.
Is Lunch worth lunching? The September
sun
Makes answer “Yes ;” no longer must
thou lag.
Forth to the stubble, cynic; take thy gun,
And add the juicy partridge to thy bag.
Out in the fields the keen-eyed pigeons coo;
They fill their crops, and then away they fly.
Pigeons are sometimes passable in stew,
And always quite delicious in a pie.
Or pluck red-currants on some summer day,

Picturing the Various Modes of Melodramatic Murder. (By Our" Off-his”-Head Poet.)
No. I.—THE DAGGER MURDER.
THEY stand alone on the moonlit spot, - Though one is Standing, and one is not,
Sing Ho-ho! and Ha-ha! there!
For one's cold as the clay there!
One is the villain, and one is not,
But the heroine's father.
They stand alone on the patch of light
(Which comes from the left as well as
right)-
Oh, 'tis a glorious place and night
For a Murder Scene! Rather!
They talk of deeds (of the parchment
kind)
_Sing Ha-ha! and Ho-ho! there!
The heavy father, to reason blind,
Has them with him to show there!
The deeds relate to the old man's will;
The villain wants them to pay a bill!"
The night is cold, and the night is still
Let the music be slow there!
They stand alone in the pale-green
light-
Sing Bey-hey! and he-he! there!
What is this flashing 80 keen and
bright?
What is this that I see there?
Oh ! deed of darkness in light descried !
Oh! villain thrice damn'd that blade to Eva
hide,
Right 'tween the arm on the farther side The villain covers the dead man's stare-
Certain death when it be there!
The corpse lies stiff in the limelight's
glare!
They're still alone on the moonlit spot The act is done -and for all I care,
Sing He-he! and Hey-hey! there! The dead body can stay there!

With a puffy, pasty, podgy, gutta-percha sort of face,
He was rushing off to drown himself, the victim of despair,
Which wrinkles sub-divided into funny little bits,
When he knocked against a person he'd not seen for quite an age,
While beady eyes peered cunningly behind two tiny slits.

["Even the Potato and the Heptarchy will not
leave us perfectly equipped.”—The Daily News
on “Why Young Men Don't Marry.”]
The Tater and the Heptarchy
Were walking hand-in-hand;
They wept like first-night” Stalls to see
The folly of the land ;
"If fools would not talk fiddlededee,”
They said "it would be grand !”
“If modest maids with towzled mops
On you and me were clear,
Do you suppose,” the Tater said,
"More men would wed each year ?"
"I doubt it,” said the Heptarchy-
“They only mean to sneer!
" O Maidens, come and cook for us!'
They-shamming love-beseech.
Oh, tell us about Baxon times !
The course of history teach!'
But what they really want is 'tin;'
A thumping share for each.

And know all HALLAM through,

But what young cubs care for is cash,
And not for me or you.

And have good weeds and wine.

They scornfully decline,
For Benedick's life of manly strife

And babes-and bonnet-strings;
But all the lot talk utter rot.

And he's short, and bull-necked.
When you come to reflect
How he wastes all his wind, 'tis queer
That the man should be stout just here!
But the noise of the throat
In the solos denote
That the cornet is fond of beer -
It's been brought up on pots of beer.

And I know why that Band is queer,
For I see in the face
Of the trombone a trace
Of the blackguard who blows it near
Me in Town, at most times of year!
And I mark, too, the face
Of that beastly big-bass-
(Which has also been reared on beer)-
And I know, too, the face
Of that other disgrace,
The fat cornet! They've come down here
They've been borrowed, and lent new gear!
But I know them of old,
And in spite of the gold
Round the hats, with the peaks just here,
I can see who they are while near.
They wear bowlers in Town,
And frock-coats which are brown,
On account of their age-or beer!
For they play to the public for beer ;
For they stand and they blow
On the kerb in a row,
And then go to the public for beer!
And so this is the Band down here!





And one knows by the way
That the instruments play,
That the talent is not too dear.
And the trombone is not too clear ;
When it has to play quick
It is moistful and thick,

Newspaper Boy (suddenly, at window). “WANT AN OBSERVER, CAPTAIN ?"
Mathilde (on Honeymoon Trip). “OH, FREDDIE, DEAR! Noi NO!! DO LET US BE QUITE ALONE !”
THE FIGHTING “FOUDROYANT”
Being TUGGED TO ITS Last BERTH-IN A SHIPBREAKER'S YARD.
(A Theme from Turner treated in Modern British style, with Apologies
to the Patriotic Painter of " The Fighting 'T'éméraire.'")
“MAYHAP you have heard, that as dear as their lives,
All true-hearted Tars love their ships and their wives."
So DIBDIN declared, and he spoke for the Tar;
He knew Jack so well, both in peace and in war!
But hang it! times change, and 'tis sad to relate,
The old Dibdinish morals seem quite out of date;
Stick close to your ship, lads, like pitch till you die ?
That sounds nonsense to-day, and I'll tell ye for why.
The good old Foudroyant-how memory dwells on
Those brave fighting names !-was once flag-ship to NELSON.
But NELSON, you know, died a good while ago,
And his flag-ship has gone a bit shaky, and so
Joan BULL, who's now full of low shopkeeping cares,
And thinks more of the Stocks than of naval affairs,
Regards not “Old Memories," that “ eat off their head.”
Turn old cracks out to grass ? No, let's sell 'em instead!
A ship's like the high-mettled racer once sung
By that same dashing DIBDIN of patriot tongue,
Grown aged, used up, is he honoured ? No, zounds!
“The high-mettled racer is sold to the hounds!”
And so with a barky of glorious name,
(It is business, of course and a Thundering Shame!!)
Worn out, she is nought but spars, timbers and logs,
And so, like the horse, should be sold—to the dogs!
As for the Foudroyant, the vessel was trim
When it fought with the French, for John BULL, under Him,
The Star of the Nile. Yes, it carried his flag,
When it captured the Frenchman. There's no need to brag,
Or to say swagger things of a generous foe.
Besides, things have doosedly altered, you know.
We're no more like NELSON than I to a Merman ;
We can sell his flag-ship for firewood, to the German !
Sounds nice, does it not? If that great one-armed Shade
Could look down on the bargain he'd_swear, I'm afraid
(If his death-purged bold spirit held yet ought of earth).
And I fancy 'twill move the gay Frenchman to mirth
To hear this last story of shop-keeping JOAN—
Or his huckster officials. The Frenchman, the Don,
The Dutchman, all foes we have licked,-may wax bold
When they hear that the brave old Foudroyant is-Sold !!!
Great TURNER has pictured the old Téméraire
Tugged to her last berth. Why the sun and the air
In that soul-stirring canvas, seem fired with the glory
Of such a brave ship, with so splendid a story!
Well, look on that picture, my lads, and on this !
And no, do not crack out a curse like a hiss,
But with stout Conan DOYLE-he has passion and grip!-
Demand that they give us back NELSON's old Ship!
British hands from protecting her who shall debar?
Ne'er ingratitude lurked in the heart of a Tar.
“ (Sings DIBDIN) That Ship from the breakers to save"
Is the plainest of duties e'er put on the brave.
While a rag, or a timber, or spar, she can boast,
A place of prime honour on Albion's coast
Should be hers and the Victory's! Let us not say,
Like the fish-hucksters, “ Memories are cheap, Sír, to-day!”
ECCLESIASTICAL TASTE.-A condiment not much in favour with
High Churchmen just now, must be “ Worcester Sauce.” It is
warranted to neutralise the very highest flavour.
Impromptu.
OF "garnered leaves"
Perhaps e'er long
And garnered sheaves"
Their simple song
Sing sentimental donkeys. I Will be of Garnered Monkeys!
“A RAILWAY from Joppa to Jerusalem” sounds like a Scriptural
Line. In future, "going to Jericho" will not imply social banish-
ment, as the party sent thither will will be able to take a return-
ticket.

LADY GAY’S SELECTIONS.
Mount Street, Grosvenor Square.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,- I got so wet on the
St. Leger day, that I've been in bed ever since
- not because I had to wait till my things
were dry-but because I caught a cold!
What a day it was !-I am told that in
addition to the St. Leger, Doncaster is chiefly
celebrated for Butter Scotch-if so, I presume
they don't make it out-of-doors, or it would
have stood a good chance of being melted-
(not in the mouth)-on Wednesday fort-
night! But the excitement of the race
fully made up for the liquid weather, and we
all-(except the backers of Orme)-enjoyed
ourselves. I was told that the Duke of
WESTMINSTER had “left the Leger at Good-
wood,” which is simply absurd, as I not only
saw it run for at Doncaster myself, but it is
ridiculous to insinuate that the Duke went
there, put the Leger in his pocket--(as if a
| Nobleman ever kept books) – walked off
quietly to Goodwood and left it there
deliberately!
I conclude it can only be an expression
coined to discount-(another ledger term)
the victory of La Flèche,-to which not half
enough attention has been drawn, solely in
my opinion) because La Flèche' is of the
gentler sex, and men don't like the "horse
of the year” to be a mare.
I still maintain she was unlucky to lose
the Derby, as she won the Oaks two days
later in two seconds quicker time:-(which
is an anachronism-as if you win once out
of twice-how can it be two seconds ?)
There was good sport at Yarmouth (last
week, though owing to the rain the course
must have been on the soft (roe) side, -by the
way you can get them now in bottles, and
very good they are. I am glad to see that
staunch supporter of the turf, Lord ELTHAM,

much out of form lately, at least so I am
told, but I was not aware that horses were

RUBY AND THE ROOK.
Ruby, although she was something of a tomboy, was a pretty and
clever girl.
But, like many pretty and clever little ladies, she was sometimes
very naughty. When she was good, she was as good as gold, but
when she was naughty, she was as naughty as pinchbeck.
The other day, when her dear Mamma was away for the morning,
it happened to be one of her pinchbeck times. Nothing would please
her-she was cross with her governess at breakfast, she quarrelled
with her bread - and -
milk; and even when her
favourite tame Rook,
Cawcus, came hopping
on her shoulder, she
refused to give it any-
thing to eat, but hit it
on the beak with her
spoon.
Miss DUMBELL was

and put flies in the

I shall expect you in

phrases quite perfect."
RUBY's eyes flashed as
she went out of the room; she pouted, she swung her skirts, and
shook her shoulders, so that even Miss DUMBELL, the most patient
and kindest of governesses, quite longed to slap her.
RUBY went to the school-room; she immediately flung the French
phrase-book from one end of the room to the other. She took some
story-books, and a little basket full of apples, bath-buns and "three-
corners,” and ran down to a little plantation called the Wilderness,
at the bottom of the garden. She selected one of the tallest elms,
and as she could climb like a kitten, she was soon at the top of it,
quite hidden from view among the leaves.
“So much for old DUMMY and her French phrases !” said the
naughty girl, as she settled herself in a comfortable position and
brought out her story-book. The stable-clock had struck twelve,
and she heard her name called in all directions, by JORGINS, the
gardener, BRILLIT, the buttons, and long-suffering Miss DUMBELL.
They could not find her anywhere, and her Most Serene Naughtiness
sat screened by the leaves and shook with laughter.
Presently “Cawcus,” her pet Rook, came fluttering amid the
leaves, and began to caw. Ruby offered him bits of Bath bun, and
even a whole three-corner, in order to keep him quiet.
But he remembered his treatment at breakfast, and refused all
these bribes with soorn. He declined to be petted, he continued to
hover over the tree, and circle around it, giving vent to the most
discordant shrieks. Presently she heard the clear measured tones of

You were going to be shot at the close of the season,
And you couldn't spare that, as there weren't any more.
But at length I prevailed, or at least you relented,
After ever so many excuses-in fine
We agreed to a compact, you only consented
On condition I gave you a portrait of mine.
Well, I promised, of course. And I write you these verses
With your face-you'll forgive me,quite close to my own.
There's a charm in your look that completely disperses
All my cares in a way that is yours, dear, alone.
And although I am pleased, since I won in the end-a
More ridiculous bargain has never, I vow,
Been arranged than a picture of pretty MELENDA,
In exchange for the photograph sent to you now.
We did not meet again through some horrible blunder,'
Which a merciless Fate must be asked to explain,
And I sometimes sit smoking, and wearily wonder
If I ever am destined to see you again.
Yet wherever the future may possibly find you,
To this final request do not answer me Nay,
When I ask that this gift of myself may remind you
Of the friend who was with you that evening in May.

“It is not very clear to me why we haven't married,” said he.
“Nor to me either!" she replied. “We dawdled a bit, and I dare-
say put it off because what one knows can be done at any moment
is often not done at all.”
“Well, hadn't we better go to the British Embassy ?"
“Why, yes,” she replied, with some hesitation; “but I really
think you had better say you will marry my cousin. I fancy it
would please AUGUSTE and HENRI."
“Anything to oblige them,” returned the Hon. JULIAN.
“That being settled, please leave me, as I have to fall in a dead
faint-must get an effective Curtain, you know !”
The Hon. JULIAN KNIGHT BELFORD nodded his head, and then
ROSE MILLWARD WOODMERE fainted-with the desired result.
CHAPTER III.-Cackle v. 'Osses. The Favourite wins.
And now Sir John and his considerate circle had come to England,
and were close to Liverpool.
“My dear people,” said HENRI, “never mind your love-making,
never mind your plot, leave it to AUGUSTE, and he will pull you
through."
And HENRI was quite right. AUGUSTE went to work with a will,
and did pull them through. He took them to the Grand National
Steeple Chace, and showed them and all the world a sight the like
of which they had never seen before. There were real horses, real
touts, and a real winner. Oh, how it went! It was magnificent!
And, before this great race, AUGUSTE (helped by HENRI this time)
showed a training-stable, and how a favourite can be nobbled.

to give the creature sufficient vigour to carry on the running until
of gratitude (for they had furnished him with an old family mansion,
a stud of racers, and passes for himself and circle to Paris) were
AUGUSTE LE GRAND, and HENRI LE PETTITT.
“My good friend,” said HENRI, “your daughter is charming.
She has been well brought up, and has the finest sentiments; but
it is necessary that she should run away to Paris, and dodge
the parson. Otherwise, how could she be called The Prodigal
Daughter ?”
Sir John saw the force of this reasoning, and consented.
"And stay,” said AUGUSTE. “We must really have a good set, and
you must go a fox-hunting. You must have armour, and a breakfast,
and all of you must wear hunting-coats. And look here, we can't
do without flowers, and coats-of-arms, and open windows."
“But," objected Sir John, “if I am going a fox-hunting, surely
it should be in the winter or spring. And how about the flowers?"
“You have got them from Nice," replied AUGUSTE.
So it was thus arranged. Sir John's daughter, who was called
ROSE MILLWARD WOODMERE, eloped and broke her father's heart.
“But,” exclaimed her bereaved parent, preparing to mount a horse
that was waiting for him on the lawn amongst the flower-beds,
" although my heart is breaking, I will show the world I am a true
English gentleman by starting off to head the chace!”

-on the Jubilee Course, which said course,
I am told, is by no means a Jubilee for the
jockeys, owing to the danger in “racing for
the bend.”
There are several horses entered who seem
to have great chances, making the race as
difficult as a problem in Euclid-but my
selection will most certainly be “there, or

“BEWARE the Jabberwock, my son!
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!"-
Ah, CARROLL! it is not in fun
Your song's light lilt we snatch.
Our Jabberwock 's a real brute,
With mighty maw, and ruthless hand,
Who ravage makes beyond compute
In Civic Blunderland.
Look at the ogre's hideous mouth!
His tiger-teeth, his dragon-tail!
O'er Town, East, West, and North and South,
.: He leaves his slimy trail.
And where he comes all Beauty dies,
And where he halts all Greenery fades.
Pleasantness flies where'er he plies
His gruesomest of trades.
He blights the field, he blasts the wood,
With breath as fierce as prairie flame;
And where sweet works of Nature stood,
He leaves us-slums of shame.
The loonst and the canker-worm
Are not more ruinous than he.
“I'll take this Eden-for a term !"
He cries, and howls with glee.

Until 'tis made A Building Plot'?
Then it indeed looks nice!

To see if Big BULLIE could lick him or no;
With his boating form that's all gammon and spinach.

So off he set with his boating-cap,

And swore at Big Bull he would just have a slap!
Which BULL declared was all gammon and spinach!

“Pray, Mr. BULL, will you race with me?!!

Says BULL, "If you like, but 'tis fiddle-de-dee!

When they came to Andrésy upon the Seine,

Big BULL pulled his hardest, but pulled in vain,
For he found his boasts were all gammon and spinach.
Heigho for British Rowing!
For in spite of the brag, and the bounce, and the chaff,
Heigho for Rowing !
The FROG beat the BULL by a length and a half,
With your MOSSOP and JAMES, licked by BOUDIN and Cuzin,
Heigho, says R. C. LEHMANN!
“Pray, Mr. BULL, do you relish the spin ?".

With your forty-one strokes all sheer gammon and spinach?"

Since then I have tried, but the late joke,
As seen in my bedside scrawl,

A USEFUL EXPERIENCE.
I AWOKE at one in the morning,
I had been two hours in bed,
When-bang !-without any warning
A joke came into my head.
'Twas brilliant, awfully funny,
It flashed through my drowsy brain,
It was worth-oh, a lot of money!-
I chuckled again and again.
I thought how I might employ it,
I laughed till the tears rolled down,
Foreseeing how SMITH would enjoy it,
And how it would tickle Brown.
I said, “I had best but hint it
To them, or they might purloin
This wonderful jest, then print it,
And between them divide the coin."
Late in the morn I awoke,-I

It is true that I begged, when inditing
My note, a reply with all speed,
And MABEL, to judge from the writing,
Fulfilled 'my petition indeed!

as a matter of filial duty-because, after all, she is his mother-but
he is clearly of opinion that these painful family reminiscences are

indistinguishable from those of operatic remorse. At all events, he

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LADY GAY'S SELECTIONS.
Mount Street, Grosvenor Square.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-Most delightful
weather favoured us last week at Gatwick
and Sandown, and most of the horses I
mentioned as worth following either finished
nowhere or were not there at all, which I
think is a fair average record for a Turf
prophet! I heard at Sandown that sweeping
reforms are to be expected in Turf matters
next Season, but I will not harp too much
on this string, as more able pens than mine
have undertaken it—though how a “pen"
can harp on a string I don't quite see-or
hear, it should be.
I certainly think Brandy would have won
the Gatwick Handicap, but I suppose the
bottle is getting low, and is being reserved
in case the Cambridgeshire is run on a cold
day! And that brings me to the considera-
tion of this great race. I do not propose
to analyse the form of all the horses, but
will devote my attention to a few of the
likely ones—who should feel complimented
thereat (I suppose a horse can feel a com-
pliment just as well as it can a whip)—from
which might spring the winner. First and
foremost, then, La Flèche has, in my opinion,
enough weight to carry, even if the jockey
is included, as I believe is the case—and I
was told by Sir CHARLEY WHITELEY, that
to win the Newmarket Oaks she had to be
“ bustled up”-a fashion which I thought
had quite gone out!-anyhow, many people
think she is “not the same mare she was”
-thongh how they can have changed her
I don't quite understand, but it would not
surprise me to find Windgall the best of
the Baron's on the day.
There are several horses spoken of as
“rods in pickle," but as a rule, these
animals stop at “rods" and never get to
“ poles” much less " perches ! ” Should
Sir Jas. MILLER win the race, the town may
resound with many a merry Tödel, but this
is trying weather for voices, though'I believe
he is running untried, but certainly trying!
There was some doubt as to the starting of
a great favourite, owing to a report that the
owner had been" forestalled"-an excuse
which always sounds very weak to me, as
surely if outsiders can back a horse at a
long price, the owner should also be able to
do so, and thus put backers “in the cart”
-where some of them would present a pic-
ture which might lead people to think the
"cart” was on its way to Tyburn! There
appears to be considerable doubt as to
whether Buccaneer has eaten anything
lately or not, so I must discard him; but I
think if he were given a sherry and bitters
at once he might recover his appetite and
win, as he is known to be a "glutton ” for
work! JEWITT's best will take some beating,
when we know which it is, which we shall
do shortly, as no stable is more ready than
this to let everyone into the secret of their
"good things; ", so if some Whisperer
should tell you that his Suspender is
broken, it is on the cards that the Pensioner
may still be able to walk home in safety !
But enough of this (as your readers will
doubtless say!)—and let us come to the point

PRESENTED AT COURT.
MR. PUNCH, SIR,
I Am indignant-disgusted! I went
last night to see a new piece, called The
Guardsman, at the Court Theatre, the plot
of which, reminded me—'tis merely a coin-
cidence-of Incognita, now going strong in
St. Martin's Lane. The coincident being that
a certain young man won't marry an uncertain
young lady whom they want him to marry, be-
cause he is in love with quite another young
lady (as he thinks) who (the incognita) turns
out to be the very lady whom he is required to
wed. However, that's not what I'm writing
about. I leave criticism to your professional
gent.” Well, Sir, it was very amusing, and
very well acted. But from a military point of
view, shameful, Sir!- shameful! The people
about me were laughing, and said that the
lines were good; that, take it all round, it
ought to be a success; that it was most
amusing. But how could I appreciate any-
thing when I found a Captain in the Guards,
on the Queen's Birthday, walking about in
plain leather boots! It was as bad, in my
mind, as when Mr. CHARLES WARNER, in
the piece called In the Ranks, appeared as a
private in the same distinguished Regiment
in patent leathers! And what was the Cap-
tain doing, Sir, in mess uniform at his uncle's
chambers, when he was supposed to be on
guard at the Tower? At least so I under-
stood him to be, but I may have been wrong.
At any rate, an odd sort of place to dine at,
if he was not on duty, and if he were, he
should not have left his post. Moreover,
where was his scarf, as orderly officer ? But
perhaps he was not on duty, and had dropped
in upon the mess (in the height of the Season!)
in a friendly sort of way. Well, that might
explain matters a bit, but not to my entire
satisfaction. And my wife tells me that it
is rather late to make alterations in a Court
dress the day before the Drawing-Room. And
she says, too, that she has never been hustled

I had made a hearty meal off the bread-and-

Empress (smiling). Very, dear; but wasn't
it a little expensive? Surely you could have
got the bread-and-milk for a smaller sum?
Emperor. Of course I could! But then,
don't you see, it made me popular. It's in
all the papers, and reads splendidly!

will find it particularly interesting. I have

make things better by fixing a ratio between gold and silver? In the
first place, you can't do it; they've got nothing to do with one
another.
First W. I. M. (triumphantly). Haven't they? What have you
got to say, then, about the Indian rupee ? That's where the whole
of your beautiful system comes to grief. You can't deny that.
Second W. I. M. The Indian rupee has got nothing to do with it.
My theory is, that it's all due to the American coinage of silver, and
(vaguely), if we do the same as they, why, we shall only make things
worse. No, no, my boy, you've got hold of the wrong end of the
stick, there. Look at the Bland Bill. Do you want to have that
kind of thing in England ?
Inquirer. God forbid! By the way, what was the Bland Bill ?
Second W. I. M. What! you don't know what the Bland Bill
was? Don't you remember it? It provided that a certain amount
of silver was to be coined every year, and the Treasury was to hold
the surplus until it reached a certain value, and then,-but every
schoolboy knows what happened.
Average Man. What did happen, as a matter of fact?
Second W. I. M. (scornfully). Why, the market was flooded.
First W. I. M. Yes, and that exactly proves my point. Make
fifteen the ratio between gold and silver, and you 'll never have the
market flooded again.
Second W. I. M. (hotly). How do you make that out?
First W. I. M. It's as plain as a pikestaff. Make silver your
legal tender for large amounts in this country, and you stop all these
United States games at one blow.
Second W. 1. M. Fiddlesticks! I suppose you'll want us to
believe next that if we become bi-metallists, corn and everything
else will go up in value ?
First W. I. M. Of course it will. We've only got to get Germany
and France, and the rest of them to come in, and the thing 's as good
as done. What I say is, adopt bi-metallism, and you relieve trade
and agriculture, and everything else.
A. M. Do you mean we shall have to pay more for everything?
First W. I, M. No, of course not; I mean that the appreciation
of gold is a calamity which we've got to get rid of.
A. M. I don't see it. If my sovereign buys more than it did
years ago, that seems to be a bit of a catch for me, don't it?
First W. I. M. Ah, I daresay you think so, but you 're wrong.

ANGLEOMANIA;
You should have seen me yesterday after mounting an eighteen
foot rod in the garden, trying to drop the bait " gently," and

so rosy as I had fancied. Don't
kinow what to do with myself!
BUMPSTEAD, my neigh-
Jame
bour, says I want a hobby:
BUMPSTEAD), who, like Silas
5; 1'egg, has a weakness for
“ dropping into poetry,” thus
doggorelises :-
"Eh? You're chippy, stale, dull cobby?
You've the blooniny hump, my BOBBY!
Stir your stumps, and mount a Ilobby!”
But what hobby? BUMPSTEAD, an enthusiastic Waltonian, says
Angling! He'll play Piscutor to my Pinator. Knows all
about it; generally smells of fish; clothes commonly speckled
with scales, with slimy dabs at knces. Stuffed fish in chilly-
looking glass-cases all over the house, even in bed-rooms. Says
ho caught 'em all himself. “ill men are liars, and some are-
anglers." So says JobSOy, my neighbour on 'tother side. But
he's an orchidomaniac, and consequently scorns BUMPSTEAD and
his hobby. Will think it over.
Second Eutry.--Jare thought it over—with results. Think I've
bought every book on angling ever written, from Dame JULIANA
| BERNERS to ANDREW LANG. As to tackle! Well, you should see.
I purchase one sample at least, of every article in Tackle-shop,
from a twenty feet salmon-rod to a sixpenny bone disgorger.
Ilaven't least idea of use of one-half of tbem. But they nearly fill
a four-wheoler, and frighten JANE, my wife, almost into fits.
BUMPSTEAD says :-
“ Never care for female cackle!
Angler's heaven is heaps of Tackle!”
But BUMPSTEAD is a bachelor.
Third Entry.-Have been reading books and studying tackle,
till I’ın half dazed. Am in great fog about baits, make an awful Fourth Entry.-I have caught my first fish!!! Only an
cight-ounce roach. But oh! the thrill of that first tug at the line,
the breathless excitement of that “ play," the finished rapture of
that “land." I was half hysterical with joy. Hooray! Angling
for ever! Bless BUMPSTEAD, and bully for IZAAK! Pass the big
stone-bottle, B., and I'll drink to my first catch.
"Oh, the gallant fisher's life
Is the best of any!
Woohoop!
“There, sit down, man,” says BUMPSTEAD tartly, “or you 'll
upset the punt and frighten away all the fish!”
Didn't catch another fish that day. But I fouled my tackle fifty
times at least, lost a top joint, and hooked--but failed to "land"
—the frame of an old umbrella.
Went home with my one fish, feeling depressed. BUMPSTEAD
says I must not be discouraged,--
“ For like C nquerors and Clowns,
Anglers have their ups and downs."
Fifth Entry.---BUMPSTEAD quite right. Anglers have their ups
and downs. Wonder if it was first called the Gentle Craft on
account of — " gentles.” Horrid clammy, wriggling, evil-smelling
things, which nobody but an ardent angler would touch. JANE

If those con-
founded “spoons,"
alarmed by my
yells, had not come
in boat to my res-
cue, that would
have been my last
day's angling. As
it is, never trust my-
self alone in punt
again until I've
learned how to
handle it. The
comfortable flat-
bottomed philistine
looking thing, once
adrift, is worse than
skates, bicycles, or
wild horses.
Seventh Entry.-
" When you can
hook, play, and land a barbel,” says BUMPSTEAD, “you may begin
to fancy yourself a fisherman of the bottom-fishing sort at least.”
Most exciting!
. When the warm sun shines, and birds do warble,
If you 're drowsy - just you hook a barbel!
With wet feet, l'ed nose, and tocs like marble,
Would you warm yourself?-just play a barbel!"
Dick DUBBINS, the Richmond fisherman, promises to teach me.
They call him “DOTTY DICK.” But he can fish.
Try for hours for a big barbel in vain. Thinking of giving it up,
when Dick cries suddenly, in a sort of choked shout, “ Got him,
Sir, by the Holy Moses ! ”
"Seven-pounder if it's a hounce!” cried Dick. "Be carefui, Sir!

and I'm left in full glare thereof. Began to melt, and
fear sunstroke. Arrange handkerchief under my straw as

“ Greenies” than Consols. CON says, “Yes." I can make
about two pounds ten by Consols in twenty years, and “six hundred
quid” in five minutes by “Greenies." Prefer “Greenies."
CON says “then that will be a flutter." Very well. Con asks
how much I am willing to lose. Reply with a laugh that “I
am willing to win as much as possible.” CON rather annoyed.

I say I will leave it to him. Come West and spend the rest of the
day at my Club watching the tape. “Greenies” seem to be
falling. They come out with Greeks, Portuguese, Italians, and
Egyptian Unified. Hang all these stocks! Who cares about
them? Man standing near me tells a friend that he has had a

child was worse, and, in her fractiousness, nothing would
content her but my companionship.-she was constantly calling

to undertake the worry and responsibility of watching a sick
child. It was not what I had been bought for, and I really felt
the need of repose. So I hid myself behind a chest of drawers;

lively—but could I bellow like the Bull? That was the test of real
ability.
I could only retort that no Rabbit who respected himself would
condescend to bellow. But I hated the Bull-all the more because
he was so confoundedly patronising ; he praised my performances,
and predicted that I should make a great noise in the Nursery
world. I made up my mind that I would drum him down at all
events before I had done ; and I did. I drummed an impression into
several influential toys that bellowing was played out, that, even
as a bellower, the Bull was an overrated animal, and that he was
beginning to repeat himself. I soon had my partisans; there were
several toys which, though neither vocally nor instrumentally
gifted themselves, were yet excellent judges of noise, and they
maintained that, while my drumming was admirably true to Rabbit-
nature, the Bull's bellow was utterly false and conventional. The
Children with whom we were connected soon adopted this view
themselves, and the Bull fell into general disrepute, though he was
such a beastly magnanimous brute that he didn't seem to mind it
much. “I've had my day," he told me (he would insist on being
friendly up to the last); "they're tired of me—and no wonder; so it's
time I made way for a newer toy !” I could not help tapping my
tambourine impatiently, for I felt that this good-humour of his
was an outrageous piece of humbug-he must be jealous of such
evident superiority as mine; of course he detested me for exposing
his pompous old imposture! My triumph would not have been half
so enjoyable if he hadn't. Well, he drifted into the background,
and the Nursery heard him no more ; after which, I had the entire
carpet to myself. I fear I allowed my head to be slightly turned.
I overdid the drumming; I took myself just a little too seriously,
perhaps. I felt that my drumming was an important factor in
Nursery society, and was entitled to the most earnest attention-II
felt bound to insist on it. This went on, and I became prouder and
prouder, until one day they brought a plain square chest into the
room, and it was rumoured among the toys, that the new arrival
was a more wonderful musician even than myself. I endeavoured
to show the absurdity of supposing that anything worthy of the
namo of music could be contained in such a very ordinary box;
but I was a little anxious myself until they wound the thing up
and it played. To my relief, it proved a very poor performance, and
the drumming-the only creditable feature in it-was simply an

the signal for a storm of howls and jeers.
JOSEPHI went on rising, and after a prolonged

a dry eye in the place. ALPHEUS CLEOPIIAS

subject that comes up for debate,
doubt about the patriotism, or, more telling still,
the common honesty of Right Hon. Gentlemen

lacking. Gentlemen opposite will feel bound to
remain and back you up. Your own side will
sit angry but interested. There will be cheering
and counter cheering. Probably you will be
replied to from whichever Front Bench you may
chance to have attacked, and your fortune is
made. I won't mention names, but I can count
off on the fingers of my two hands just as many
men who are Ministers to-day, or were Ministers
yesterday, who owe their emergence from
obscurity directly to these tactics."
Very glad I came to the Fountain Head for
advice on this subject. Seems easy enough to
follow. I'll certainly try. When we get fairly
to work in February, Cudcattleshire shall loom

AND PUNCH'S ALMANACK FOR 1893.
By shooting soon, or shooting late,
I missed them; yet it does seem funny
Though it were wiser not to care
For trities such as these, they rexed me;
My skill--I would not boast-is fair,
And this day's waut of it perplexed me.
So, as I stood and watched the trees,
1 I vowed this time to aim much harder,
And kill iny birds in style, and pleaso
My host, and help to fill his larder.
MINOR MISERIES.
HALF-COCK.
(By Mr. Punch's Hammer: Gunner.)
It was a dull December day-
Days mostly are in mid-December ;-
From tree to tree a shrieking jay
Made discord, as I woll remember.
“Line up, you boys," I heard him plain,
The Keeper cried Left hand, move faster.”
Slight sounds, but burnt into my brain
By that dull day's supreme disaster.
Oh, sweet to one whose gun is cocked
The pheasant's rustle mid the trees is.
It was a covert thickly stocked
With pheasants as with mites a cheese is.
The line drew onward in its beat,
And, though the sticks kept up a clatter,
I seemed to hear a thousand feet
Of pheasants on the dry leaves patter.
I scarce had shot a single bird.
Iknow not why—these things are puzzles-
Pheasant and rabbit both preferred
To die that day by other muzzles.
Or if somo reckless bird aspired
To suit me, it was very odd he
Seemed, as without effect I fired,
All tail, and not a scrap of body.
Some twenty rabbits, too, had crossed
The grassy rides where I was posted.
My score was cighteon rabbits lost,
And only two completely “ghosted."

At last, at last! a whirr of wings!
Here comes a bunch of six or seven.
To right, to left, they stream in strings,
Some low, come soaring high as heaven.
I raised my gun; with might and main,
While straight above the pheasants rocket,
I pulled and pulled, but all in vain,
For I had quite forgot to cock it.
Away they flew: can pardon be
For bursts of language double-shotted ?
When l'ncle Toby's speech flew free,
The word was by an Augel blotted.
Yet it while I addressed my gun,
That Angel marked me as I muttered,
He must have dropped more tears than ono
To blot the hasty words I uttered.
And still, though years have passed away,
And memories fade as men grow older,
My dreams repeat that fatal day;
The half-cocked gun is at my shoulder,
I strive to cry, my voice is dumb,
While, by my nightmaro fears made bigger,
Flocks of g gantic pheasants come,
And bid me tug the useless trigger.
That fancy thus should elongate
The short but most decoptive bunny.

CHAPTER I. - I spend Christmas with Uncle Joux, who very kindly lends me
his Boots and Breeches (my own Frock-coat answers admirably for the upwardl
man), mounts me on his old Mare, and sends me, in his place, to take charge of
Cousin Maut with the Hounds. Very jolly this-nice girl, MAUD-should not
mind taking charge permanently.
Chapter II.- They are off, I shall be too, if this goes on. Everybody gone
mad (old Mare included). Mald rides wildly past me, begs me to go back and
