SCENE—The Elysian Fields, a flower-gemmed bank, by a flowing stream, beneath the sylvan shade of unfading foliage.
Mr. PUNCH—who is free of all places, from Fleet Street to Parnassus—discovered, in Arcadian attire, attempting
"numerous verse" on a subject of National importance—to wit, the approaching Royal Marriage.
Ar. Punch. Propt on this “ bank of amaranth and moly,"
Talk about Dog-days! Is that nectar iced ?
Beneath the shade of boughs unmelancholy,
Then just one gulp! It beats the highest priced
I meditate on Æstas and on Hymen!
And creamiest champagne. Now, silence, Dog,
Pheugh! What a Summer! Torrid drought doth try And let me give my lagging Muse a jog !

His fiery car to welcome her! By Jove,
Humph! I do hope the happy Royal Pair
That sounds Spenserian! Illustrious Love
(Whose counterfeit presentments front me there,
Epithalamion demands, and lo!
Inspiring, in young manhood and frank beauty)
We've no official Laureate, to let flow,
Will think their Laureate hath fulfilled his duty,
With Tennysonian dignity and sweetness,
His labour of most loyal love, discreetly.
Courtly congratulation. Dryden's neatness,
Compliments delicate, piled not sickly-sweetly,
Even the gush of Nahun Tate or Pre
Like washy Warton's, nor so loud thrasonical —
Are not available, so Pusch must try
Like Glorious Joan's—that they sound half ironical !
His unofficial pen. My tablets, Toby!
'Tis hard indeed for loyal love to hit
This heat is enough to give you hydrophoby !
The medium just 'twixt sentiment and wit-

[Toby barks, and a mellifluous voice soundeth, courteously
intervenient, as two splendid Shades steal silently
through the verdurous shadows.
First Voice. But you have hit it, never-missing-One!
Second Voice. For fulsome twaddle finds best check iu Fun!
Mr. Punch (with respectful heartiness). What ! Sweet-voiced
SPENSER! Chivalrous-souled SIDNEY!!
This is a joy! For heroes of your kidney
Punch hath a heartier homage, as he hopes,
Than the most thundering Swinburnian tropes
Could all express !
Spenser (smiling mildly). Algernon 's one of Us!
In fierce superlatives, and foam and fuss,
He deals o'ermuch, but proof lies in his page.
He's of the true Parnassian lineage,
And should be Laureate—if he care to be so.
Sidney. Would he but heed what Horace wrote to Piso !
“ The singing-skill of god Apollo's giving"
Is his, however, and no lyrist living
Hath such a stretch of finger, or such tone.
Mr. Punch. Faith, but he sings immortal Fames—your owi,
My Philip, latest and not least--in strains
That thrill our nerves and mount into our brains.
If he would study less in Gossos's “ School”
(That of “ Abuse," o'er which you laid the rule
In your “ Defence of Poesy '), and stay
Less in dim Orcus than Arcadia,
Then-well, I might have well been spared this task.
SPENSER, you penned your own ; now may I ask
Epithalamion-recipes from you ?
Spenser (smiling). Yes—when you need them! I was Lau-
reate too!
There's enough inspiration in those faces
[Pointing to portraits of the Duke of York and the
Princess May.
To bring the needful Muses, and the Graces,
All to your aid !
Mr. Punch.
By Jove! That “ takes the cake."
You great Eliz ibethans had the knack
Of courtly compliment. Young GEORGE, fair May,
Shall have your mot upon their marriage day,
As a choice wedding gift, to pair with mine!
Spenser and Sidney (together). What's that ?
Jr. Punch (politely). One you may share, if you incline.
Tobias, hand the new-bound Oracle here !
Take it, brave Sidney, take it, Spenser dear !
It may enliven e'en this amaranth shore ;

Who “do up" your linen, and don't "put

You lead endurable lives!
Wash-Starch-Iron!
That may mean home dampness and dirt;
But at least your collars won't chafe your
neck,
And you'll boast a wearable shirt !
But why do I dream of soap,
Or of honest knuckle-bone ?
Now most men's shirts come home in a shape
That's dreadfully like my own-
That's dismally like my own,
Unless a home laundry they keep;
Great Scott! that shirts should be so dear,
And chloride and wire so cheap!
Scrub! Scrub! Serub!
The wire-brush never flags;
And what's the result? 'A collar that's
And a front that's ever in rags!
That frayed-out wristband worries me sore,
It catches-and shows-the dirt.
And as for the collar !!!-I'll bet you a

Oh! but to breathe the breath
Of old country linen so sweet,
Wherein lavender was spread,
Which was dried on the grass at our

For only one short week
To feel as I used to feel,
Before women washed with chloride of lime,
And scrubbed with brushes of steel!
Oh! but for one short week
Of the good old-fashioned wash,
Before a laundry meant utter rot,
Lime, wax, and such chemical bosh!!
A little swearing would ease my heart,
At that ogress, false, inhuman;
So to the papers a line I'll drop,
On the Modern Washer woman!
With fingers ready and fleet, i
With features indignantly red,
A poor Clerk wrote of his linen in rags,
And this is what he said :-
“Stitch ! Stitch ! Stitch !
Yet I can't keep a decent shirt !
The thing has reached an unbearable pitch,
So-as an appeal to the poor and the rich-
I sing the new Song of the Shirt!”.

Three years that all too quickly went,

He vowed that he'd be married-never!
But I was then engaged to MAUDE,
To MAUDE, who swore to love me ever.
Perhaps she kept her plighted word-
But, if she did, she chose as funny
A way as I have ever heard-
She married Some One Else and Money.
Maybe she did not feel inclined
To risk the bread-and-cheese and kisses,
Or else her calculating mind
Preferred "Her Ladyship” to “Mrs.”
So I'm unmarried to this day,
And live without the great felicity
Which, as Tor used of old to say,
Can't fail to wait on domesticity.

COMPANIONS of his ardent youth,
Or comrades of his riper years;
The poor who felt his kindly ruth,
And mourn him with unpurchased tears;
Men of the world whose mordant sense
Shorn of all maudlin sentiment
Seemed the sharp touchstone of pretence;
Soft hearts on swift world-bettering bent,
All miss, all mourn the man whom all
Responsive found to each high call.

Far dim-seen hours of arduous fight
When gaiety possessed the earth,
When morning felt no fear of night;

But thoughts of dashing MONTAGU,
That dauntless soul now lying dead,
After long fight with pitiless pain
Make the old memories live again.
Before the triumphs of the Court,
Before the honours of the Bench,
Wild days there were of toil and sport,
Long ere our brows had learned to blench
At threatenings of the first grey hair.
Ahl cordial comrade, champion stout,
The fierce ordeal you had to bear
Is ended; fortune's final flout
Has fallen, and that gallant breast
Is still at last in well-earned rest.
It was your happy lot to blend
Sound brain and sympathetic heart;
The loyal service of a friend,
With worldly wisdom keen and tart.

Compassion mild, not cynic spleen
Tempered the edge of caustic wit.

Of your MORRISSES, and SWINBURNES, and that gang ?
I could lick them in a canter-that's a moral!
I'm the most prolific bard who ever sang.
Of the modern Music Hall I'm chosen Laureate,
My cackle and my patter fill the Town ;
I'm more popular than BURNS, a thing to glory at;
My name is PINDAR BOANERGES BROWN.
You have never heard it mentioned ? Bighly probable
A hundred duffers flourish on my fame;
But the Muse is 80 peculiarly rob-able,
And I am very little known-by name?
But ask the Big BONASSUS-on the Q. T.-
Or ask the Sisters SQUORKS, of P. B. B.
And they'll tell you Titan Talent, Siren Beauty,
Would be both the frostiest fizzles but for Me!
Gracious Heavens! When I think of all the cackle

No wonder that the task I've now to tackle-
Something new and smart for TRICKSY TRIP!-appals.
I have tried three several songs-and had to “stock 'em,"
She's imperative; her last Great Hit's played out,
And she wants “ a new big thing that's bound to knock 'em."
And "she'd like it by return of post !”-No doubt!!!
She does four turns a night, and rakes the shekels ;
She sports a suit of sables and a brougham.
Five years ago a lanky girl, with freckles,
First fetched 'em with my hit, " The Masher Groom.”
And now her limbs spread pink on all the posters,
And now she drives her pony-chaise-and Me!

And now, a prey to stone-broke melancholia,
I sit and rack my fancy, to no end!
My ink runs dry, my wits seem gone wool-gathering ;
And yet I know that over half the town
My “stuff” the Stars are blaring, bleating, blathering,
Sacking a tenner where I pouch a crown.
I know that my-anonymous-smart verses,
Are piling oof for middlemen in sacks,
My verse brings pros. seal-coats and well-stuffed purses
My back care bows, whilst profits lade their backs.
If you 'll show me any “Poet” more prolific,
If you 'll point to any " patterer" more smart,
One whose patriotic" zeal is more terrific,
Who can give me at snide slang the slightest start,
Who can fit a swell, a toff, a cad, a coster,
At the very shortest notice, as I can,
Why, unless he is a swaggering impostor,
I will gladly hail him as the Coming Man !
But he'll have to be a dab at drunken drivel,
And he'll have to be a daisy at sick gush,
To turn on the taps of swagger and of snivel,
Raise the row-de-dow heel-chorus and hot flush.
He must know the taste of sensual young masher,
As well as that of aitch-omitting snob;
And then-well, I'll admit he is a dasher,

ELSIE AND THE MACAW.
ELSIE was growing a big girl, and though she was still in short
frocks, she gave herself airs, and had ideas about dress, and some-
times was tempted to argue with her dear Mamma and give her a pert
answer. She was, however, in high glee just now, because she had
been invited by her Aunt DABBLECHICK to a pic-nic with a lot of other
little boys and girls. She made a great fuss about her dress, she
studied The Queen, and The Gentlewoman, and other papers devoted
to this important subject, and
worried her poor Mamma with
all sorts of silly suggestions.
The costume, however, was at
last arranged, and the little
goose was cross because her
Mamma would not allow her to
have a blue feather in her hat.
ELSIE, like a naughty child,
determined that she would,
by some means or other, have
this feather.
How to obtain one was the
difficulty. At last it struck
her that the splendid Macaw,
a gift from her Uncle, Admiral
SANGARORUM, brought from Bra-
zil, had some lovely feathers of
about the right tint.
Taking a few lumps of sugar
with her, she paid a visit to the
conservatory where “Lord Ma-
cawley," as he was called, swung
all day and shrieked. She felt
how naughty she was, but her
overweening vanity quite stifled
her conscience. She scratched
the bird's poll, treated him to
several lumps of sugar, and, when he was not looking, suddenly
jerked one of the finest feathers out of his tail.
“Lord Macawley" screamed furiously, and ELSIE was terribly
frightened for fear she should be discovered. She, however, ran
away with her prize, and carefully fixed it in her hat.
LIKE AS Two P's!

memory for riddles. She was delighted with that somewhat old
conundrum about “What is more wonderful than Jonah in the
whale ?” to which the answer is, “Two men in a fly," and deter-
mined to puzzle her nephew with it the very next time she met him.
“Such a capital riddle I've got for you, JOHN!” she exclaimed.
“Let me see. Oh, yes-I remember-yes, that's it;" and then,
having settled the form of the question, she put it thus-“ What is

MINI
MIXED NOTIONS.—No. IV. EGYPT.
Two Well-Informed Men, an Inquirer, and an Average Man, in
suburban morning train to London.
First Well-Informed Man (reading his paper). Oh, I say, dash it,
this 'll never do. Here's this young KHEDIVE of Egypt kicking up a
shine, and dismissing British Ministers. We can't have that, you know.
Inquirer. What Ministers has he dismissed ?
First W. I. M. Why, British Ministers,—at least (reading on) I
mean Egyptian Ministers; that's to say, chaps whom we appointed.
Second W. 1. M. Come, come, we couldn't appoint Egyptian
Ministers, could we ?
First W. I. M. Oh, it comes to exactly the same thing; they 're
appointed subject to our proviso (consulting paper), yes, subject to our
veto, and then this little whipper-snapper goes and gives them the
chuck. He'll jolly soon have to climb down off that.
Average Man. Gently! The young chap's King, after all, isn't he ?
I thought Kings might appoint or dismiss Ministers as they liked.
First W. I. M. Oh, rot! The QUEEN can't appoint her own
Ministers. We all know that. They're appointed by the Prime
Minister. Any fool knows that.
Inquirer. But who appoints the Prime Minister?
First W. I. M. He appoints himself, and tells the QUEEN he's
done it. They all go and kiss hands and get their seals, or something
of that sort.
Inquirer. Of course, of course. I forgot that. But how about
these Egyptian beggars ?
First W. I. M. The KHEDIVE's had the cheek to dismiss the
Ministry, and shove another lot in. I see Lord CROMER has been to
the Palace to protest.
Inquirer. Lord CROMER! Who's he?
First W. I. M. My dear fellow, fanoy not knowing that! Lord
CROMER 's our Ambassador at Cairo.
Second W. I. M. Oh, nonsense. There are no ambassadors at Cairo.
First W. I. M. Aren't there? Oh, indeed. Well, then perhaps
you 'll tell me what Lord CROMER is ?
Second W. I. M. He's our Minister. That's what they call them.
Inquirer. Was it him the KHEDIVE dismissed, then ?
Second W. I. M. (laughing heartily). No, no; we haven't got to
that yet. He dismissed his own Johnnies, of course; Egyptians.
Lord CROMER 's the English Minister.
Average Man. No, he isn't. He's the English Agent.
Second W. I. M. Oh, well, it's the same thing.
First W. I. M. (taking his revenge). No, it isn't at all the same
thing; it's a very different thing. 'A Minister's only just short of
an Ambassador, and an Agent (pauses)—well, he's something quite
different. I don't think he gets as much pay for one thing, and of

How this will calm your wives' wild
fears,
And give your stout hearts ease!
Hope's blue eyes gleam above the main,
Her lifted light will glow,
And sweep o'er the deep,
When the stormy winds do blow;
When the tempest rages loud and long,
And the stormy winds do blow.
II.
The spirit comfort gathers,
From schemes designed to save
Brave fellows, who have dared the deep,
Near home to find a grave.
See how o'er rock and quicksand fell,
The Electric ray doth glow,
And sweep o'er the deep,
While the stormy winds do blow;
While the tempest rages loud and long,
And the stormy winds do blow !
III.
BRITANNIA needs as bulwarks
Light-towers along the steep,
To save her gallant sons from grayes
Near home, though on the deep:
With levin as from Jovian hand
She'll light the floods below,
As they roar on the shore,
When the stormy winds do blow;
When the tempest rages loud and long,
And the stormy winds do blow.,
Iv.
The Mariners of England
Glad eyes shall shoreward turn
In danger's night. Behold, brave hearts,
Where the Star of Hope doth burn !
Science, tired by Humanity,
Their grateful song shall flow
To the fame of your name,
When the storm has ceased to blow :
When the storm is o'er, and they ’re safe
ashore,
Thanks to 'Hope's beacon-glow!

FINALITY.
["He was one of those who believed
that, even in the ordinary legislation
of the House, and still more in a
measure of such complexity, it was
the utmost folly to talk of finality!”
- Mr. J. Redmond on the Home- Rule
Bill.]
ARE our sage legislators, then,
set upon finding
A measure that’s “final, con-
clusive, and binding,"
As lawyer-phrase puts it? They
might as well try
To fix dawn in the East, or nail
clouds to the sky!
There's nothing that's “final”
in infinite time,
That great, goalless, measureless
race-course sublime;
In which relays of runners must
keep up the race;
There's nothing "conclusive" in
limitless space;
And “binding" man's soul to
his best of to-day
For the future of growth, in an
absolute way,
Were folly as futile as binding
an oak
To the seedling's first prop, or
the sapling's first yoke;
For provisional law, not for secu-

Such phrases are fit. Yet to heal
age-long strife
By the very best “betterment”

Till a better shines forth's the

Everything excellently planned, the man, the hour,

in artfullest way. ESMONDE, mildest-mannered man
that ever whipped for Irish party, casually, as if he
were inviting him to have a cigarette, asked WOLMER
across House whether it was true that he had called
Irish Members “ forty paid mercenaries"? WOLMER, an
equally well-dressed, civil-spoken young man, smilingly
admitted that it was quite true he had couched a remark
in the terms quoted, but had certainly not meant any-
thing offensive to Irish Members. Indeed, general aspect
of noble Lord, and his tone, suggested feeling of surprise
that ESMONDE and his friends should not rather have
felt complimented by the observation challenged.
This turned out to be polite crossing of swords before
duel to the death, a shaking of hands before deadly
set-to without gloves. SEXTON suddenly dashed in,
and, with back-handed stroke at WOLMER, went for

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, February 20.-New
Chairman to-day; dropped in in most casual way.
Wondered to see MELLOR wandering about Library and
corridors at three o'clock in afternoon in full evening
dress. “Going out to tea ?" I asked, in my genial
way.
Order! order!” said MELLOR; "the Hon. Member
will please give notice of that question." And he
stalked off, trying to convey to the mind of his as-
tonished interlocutor as near an approach to back view
of COURTNEY as could be attained, without loan of late
Chairman's famous summer pantaloons.
Everything explained later. Soon as questions over,
Mr. G., rising and fixing glittering eye on SPEAKER,
observed, “I beg to move that you, Sir, do now leave
the Chair.” Strangers in Gallery pricked up their
ears; thought SPEAKER been doing something, and was
now in for it. Right Hon. Gentleman offered no
defence, but meekly left Chair. Mr. G. up again like
a shot. “I beg to move that Mr. MELLOR do take
the Chair,” he said. Then MELLOR (fortuitously on
spot in evening dress) stepped into Chair, where through
six Sessions, COURTNEY has sat ruling the whirlwind out
of order, and riding on the storm All done in moment.

said, addressing Chairman, “that you do report pro-

Rather hard this on MELLOR. Just got into Chair;
beginning to feel comfortable. Had proposed subject
that might have agreeably occupied Committee for half
an hour, when here comes the untameable, irresistible,
peremptory Mr. G., and bundles him off. At first some
signs of inclination to resist. New Chairman, having
put question and declared it carried, should forth with
have stepped away from the table. MELLOR dropped
into Chair again.
A moment of embarrassment. COURTNEY, looking
critically on form below Gangway, grimly smiled.
Members under Gallery tittered. Clerk nudged new
Chairman in ribs. MELLOR sat on till, lifting his eyes,
discovered Mr. G. meaningly regarding him. Knew
he'd be up again if he didn't go; 80 with promising
alacrity, hopped out of Chair, and disappeared from
ken of House.
"Well, I don't know," said honest BILL CREMER.
"Of course I don't hold with COURTNEY's goings-on

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THANK you, Mrs. HUNGERFORD (says the
Baron, bowing his very best to the talented
authoress), for one of the cheeriest, freshest,
and sweetest-if I may be allowed to use the
epithet- of one-volume'd stories I've read
for many a day. The three daughters are
delightful. I question whether you couldn't
have done better with “two only, as are
generally necessary ;” but perhaps this is
ungrateful on my part. Anyway, two out
of the three lovers are scarcely worth men-
tioning, so I don't think I am far wrong,
for the team was a bit unmanageable, well
as you had them in hand. Excellent, too,
is the sketch of Dad, though that of Aunt
Jane is a trifle too grotesque, and will, per-
force, remind those of your readers, who are
theatre-goers, of Mr. PENLEY in petticoats,
now actually playing “Charley's" irresistibly
comio Aunt at the Globe Theatre. But it
is all good, and not too good to be true.
Likewise, my dear Madame, you have given
us two life-like sketches, one of a car-driver
with his vicious mare, and the other of
Molly's little dog. In conclusion, I congra-
tulate you, Mrs. HONGEE FORD, as also the
publisher, Mr. HEINEMANN, on having

there was large muster, evidently taken by
surprise. They know the SPEAKER, because they
daily live with him. How outside public should
have been seized with such keen appreciation of
his worth was more than they were prepared for.
This may have been, probably was, to some
extent a succès d'estime. Mr. PEEL's speech was
genuine triumph ; very brief, the shortest of the
series, but incomparably the best; lofty in tone,
perfect in delivery, saying just the right thing at
the right moment in the right way. Its effect at
Mansion House something like that which electri-
fied House when Mr. PEEL, standing on steps of
Chair, faced it for first time as its SPEAKER,
revealing, even to those who had known him long,
the full depths of his nature and the towering
height of his capacity.
"Mon Dieu, TOBEE," said an eminent French-
man, “ the world in both hemispheres has always
envied you the possession of your House of
Commons. Now we know you have a speaker
worthy of its best traditions."
Banquet a great success ; certainly the most
brilliant galaxy of guests drawn together in same
place since Mr. PHELPS, the American Minister,
said farewell in memorable speech. Much struck
with completeness of arrangements. Even the
waiters imbued with consciousness of great
occasion.
“Hope you enjide your dinner, Sirp” said one
to me, when dessert placed on table.
“Excellent," I said; “perhaps the whitebait
done a little too much ; showed tendency to pre-
sent itself in fragments; but 'twas nothing."
Yessir," said the Waiter, diligently brushing
| off imaginary crumbs. “I'm going now, Sir.”
"Ah,” I said; “then I suppose you don't
wait to hear the speeches ; flow of reason, you
know, quite a treat."
"Yessir," said he, still pegging away at the
spotless table-cloth. “Can I get you anything
more, Sir ?"
"No, thank you," I said, quite touched at the
man's considerate attention, the more marked
since, as far as I recognised him, I had not seen
| him before. “I've done excellently."
“Yessir. I'm going now." Hardly seemed able
to part. Not sure whether, in circumstances of
international amity, I shouldn't have shaken
hands with him. Made half advance in that
direction. He quickly advanced his hand, but
after glance at my extended palm, as rapidly
withdrew it. Perhaps he was right. Not usual
to shake hands with Waiter, though really, on
occasion like this, one might disregard con-
ventionalities. Waiter lingeringly withdrew, still
keeping his eye on me, as if expecting me to call
him back. Nodded a friendly farewell, and
pensively peeled an orange, thinking how one
touch of nature makes us kin. This good Waiter

Then the General from the War
Office called up the Company Officers.
“Gentlemen,” said he, we shall

have had so much experience. You
will do all sorts of new work, and

near future. Not that it will in-

But the Company Officers did not
seem to see it, so they sent in their
papers and marched away. Then
the General from the War Office
called up the rest of the Regiment.
“Now, Non-commissioned Officers
and Men," said he," you have no one
to command you, and no one to pay
for your marches out, prizes, and the
rest of it. But don't let that bo-
ther you. You may still call your-
selves Soldiers-not that I call you
so myself. I mean off parade."
But the remainder of the Regiment
did not seem to see it, so they sent
in their resignations, and vanished.
Then the Officer from the War
Office rode towards Pall Mall.
“It won't interfere with me
much," said he," and give the De-

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday Night,
March 13.-No use disguising fact that when
House discovered FREDERICK MILNER stand-
ing behind Front Opposition Bench, bran-
dishing heavy boot in his hand as he addressed
ASQUITH, it held its breath. Political passion
runs pretty high of late; Opposition stirred
to deepest depths by persistence of Govern-
ment in attempting to read Home-Rule Bill
Second Time before Easter. There have
been sittings after midnight; sittings through
Saturday; hot words bandied about; pre-
paration for deadly duel in lobby. No one
can say whither men may be led when onoe
they permit angry passions to rise. CHARLES
RUSSELL, whose acquaintance with oriminal
classes is extensive, tells me it is by no means
uncommon thing for prisoner in dock to take
off boot and hurl it at head of presiding
Magistrate or Judge.
* Usually an old woman who does it,” he
added.
“But this is Sir FREDERICK MILNER,
Bart.," I said.
“Um!” said RUSSELL, with odd signif-
cance in the observation.
Turns out the apprehension groundless.
MILNER only wants to know why Police at
Leeds and Bradford should enjoy ultimate re-
sources of civilisation in respect of“ SCAITH'S
silent boots," whilst London Policemen not so
privileged ? MILNER tells me his earliest idea
was to get a pair of the boots, put'em on, and
surprise SPEAKER by approaching with noise-
less tread from behind Chair, lean over his
shoulder, and suddenly say, "Boo!” That,
MILNER thought, would be conclusive proof
of the efficacy of the boots as making the
tread inaudible. On other hand, SPEAKER
mightn't like it. So, by way of compromise,
brought down odd boot in tail-pocket of his
coat, and shook it at HOME SECRETARY when
he put question.
ASQUITH behaved very well under trying
circumstances. Did not visibly blench;

thinking the more. In Conservative ranks feeling of profound

From Miss Belinda Bullion at Monte Carlo, to Miss Angelina Vcaudor, in Mayfair. (Being a Pendant to a celebrated Poem by Praed.)
They tell me you've “landed” a lover
If he seems getting paler or thinner,

Before your first Season is over,
Before I have left you a week.
If he gives too much time to his Tennis,

Neglectful of dear L. S. D.,
Who is he? I wish I could guess.
If he chatters of WHISTLER and Venice,
If it's dear Lord Fitz-FRUMPINGTON's brother,
If he cares about Five o'clock Tea;
If he's not sometimes rude or capricious

Such signs are extremely suspicious ;
Are sensible girlhood's sole guides,

And sentiment calmly derides.
If he shows a contempt for “the City,"
I gave you "Bel Ami” as token
And drops little jeers about Jews,
That we were not victims of “glow;"
If he talks of “the People" with pity,
You gave me your vow-is it broken?
Or rails at the Sweaters as "screws,"
My own ANGELINA, say "No!”
These things prove a “popular leaning,"
And popular leanings are low;

And the realms of the dumpishly dodgy. Learn all the mad logic of hate,

THE FOX AND THE GUINEA-PIGS.
(A Financial Fable.)
[" There are dozens of Companies now existing

ACRES, Bart., Major GUINBÁ Pic, M.P., and
the like, figuring upon the Board of Directors.
A short, but drastic Act, making all such figure-
heads directly responsible, would go far to prevent
similar occurrences, and to abolish a delusive, if
not a fraudulent system."-Herbert T. Reid's

So much for Virtue. Repentance may be treated according to the
same formula.
(1) My dear boy, never repent. Repentance leads inevitably to
repetition.
(2) Repentance is like a secret. If you keep it to yourself it
loses all interest. Nobody can repent on a desert island.
(3) To repent is to have been unsuccessful.
(4) Not to be repentant is never to have enjoyed.
(5) Repentance in a man means nothing more than an intention to
change his methods; in a woman it is a last tribute to an expiring
reputation.
Having finished these examples, I will put down a few notions for
general use.
(1) Necessity knows no law, and therefore has to learn.
(2) Everything comes to the man who is waited upon.
(3) The later the bird the better for the worm.
(4) It is never too late to-dine.
There you have the whole secret. Be fearfully cynical, dreadfully
bold, delightfully wicked, and carefully unconventional; let paradox

BY GEORGE!
A CORRESPONDENT of the Daily Telegraph suggests that, as the
Scotch keep up St. Andrew's Day, and the Irish St. Patrick's, the
English should also have a national fête on St. George's Day, the
23rd of April. Why not have the 23rd as St. George's Day, and the
24th as the Dragon's Day? We ought to “Remember the Dragon”
-say, by depositing wreaths before the Temple Bar specimen.
A Dragon's Day would be a most useful National Institution. The
object would not be to exalt the beast, but to celebrate our own
(and GEORGE's) triumph over it. Everybody has his own private
Dragon, and some people have public ones as well. For example,
Sir WILFRID Lawson, in laying down his wreath, would be com-
memorating the introduction of the Veto Bill; Mr. GLADSTONE
would be slaying (in spirit) the Leader of the Opposition in the

“MUCH ADO ABOUT Nil."—Were the Temporal Power in exist-
ence, the LORD MAYOR, in proposing the toast of the POPE before
that of the QUEEN, would have been guilty of a blunder, and we all
know, on TALLEYBAND's authority, how far worse is a blunder than
a crime. But the POPE, being no longer “two single gentlemen
rolled into one, but simply, as it might be set down in a Play-bill
of Dramatis Persone, “First Bishop." and also. by his own style
and title, “Servus Servorum,” the health of His Holiness (which is
uncommonly good) might, in British Dominions, be introduced
after that of the QUEEN and Royal Family, and could be fitted into
Church and State as neatly as possible, that is, where such a toast
is a necessity of the entertainment. But the stupidity of the
incident has been surpassed by the idiocy of the notice taken of it,
and, for the sake of the common sense of the Common Council, it is
to be hoped that a large majority will be on the side of Alderman
and Sheriff RENALS, and refuse to toast the LORD MAYOR on the
Gridiron of LAWRENCE.

[The most gorgeous red yet discovered has lately been produced from the
rare metal ruthenium.]
Who'll sell me a second-hand lyre and a plectrum,
Or (since it's the fashion) a mandoline ?
Con amore I'd sing the new shade of the spectrum-
No spook, though it haunts me-its name is Ruthene.
Nay, don't be alarmed, for I'm no supersubtle
Decadent bard with an eye full of green;
I merely (to copy the late Captain Cuttle)
Am “making a note" in the key of Ruthene.
Well, R's a red letter, you see its ray glow forth-
Look in your “dic" if you doubt what I mean;
Red, rufous, rouge, ruddy, rose, russet, and so forth,
Have all rolling r's like resplendent Ruthene.
More “clamant” than carmine, vermilion, crimson,
Costlier than diamond or ultramarine-
A deuce of a theme to chant lyrics or hymns on,
Or rummage for orotund “rot,” is Ruthene.
Orange-hued are the Odalisque's henna-dyed fingers,
English girls' lips are encarnadine;
A rubicund flame round the toper's nose lingers-
But I'm blest if they rival the blush of Ruthene.
Pink huntsman, gules ensign, deep flush of the sunset,
Cardinal's scarlet, “red” gold have I seen,
With red ruin, red rhubarb, red herring-but none set
My iris afire as does red-hot Ruthene.
The quest, though, is simpler of Roc's egg or Sangreal,
Easier to fashion a flying machine,
Than for my Muse to fake up (forgive Cockney slang) real
Readable rhymes in praise of Ruthene.
THE SCOTTISH TREVELYANDERER.
(Mr. Hozier's Version.)
[Mr. HOZIER (on the Second Reading of the “Registration of Votes
(Scotland) Amendment Bill”) said, "the fame of Mr. GERRY, the Governor
of Massachusetts, would sink into insignificance if this Bill were to pass. In
future they would not talk of Gerrymandering, but of Trevelyandering. ...
Trevelyandering, however, wás a game at which two could play ; in fact, in
the words of the poet, they might fairly say: -
“What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander,
And possibly two can Trevelyander!”]
AIR –“ The British Grenadiers."
SOME talk of Gerrymander, and some of HERCHELLES,
Of HALSBURY and Mr. BRYCE, and such great names as these.
But of all the world's great jobbers (swears HOZIER) none compare
With the job, job, job, job, job, job, of the “Tre-vel-yan-der-er!”
GERRY, of Massachusetts, was smartish, for his time,
But HOZIER "goes one better." it moves his soul to rhyme.
Our Scottish Wegg (sans timber leg) drops into verse—though queer,
About the game-which two can play-of the "Tre-vel-yan-de-rer!”
There's Jove, the god of thunder, and Mars, the god of war,
Brave Neptune, with his trident, but here's a greater, far!
HOZIER-Apollo now is seen descending from his sphere
To string betimes impromptu rhymes on the “. Tre-vel-yan-de-rer!”
Then let us fill a bumper, and drink a health to those
Who, “dropping into poetry,” leave lesser wits to prose,
And especially to HOZIER, who raised a ringing cheer,
By his doggerel delightful on the “Tre-vel-yan-de-rer !”

fess I always do; been chuckling just now over idea that
here we have the whole thing played out. There's Mr.
Punch in person of Mr. G. Up comes a head, GRANDOLPH'S,
or someone else's; down comes the bâton in the form of
the Closure. Everyone supposes that Law and Order are
established and things will go smoothly, when suddenly up
springs JOEY, cool as a cucumber, and upsets everything
again. There's nothing new under the sun, not even pro-
ceedings in obstruction of Home-Rule Bill."
After dinner SOLICITOR-GENERAL discovered seated on
Treasury Bench. A great thirst for speech from him sud-
denly afflicted Opposition. Mr. G. spoke, and John MORLEY
moved the Closure, but nothing would satisfy them save
speech from RIGBY. Pauses in conversation were filled by
cries upon his name. He sat unresponsive, looking wiser
than ever, but still unspeakably wise.
DARLING's Amendment got rid of with assistance of
Closure. GRANDOLPH rashed in; hotly moved to report pro-
gress. Only ten o'clock; two hours more before Debate
adjourned. This merrily filled up with divisions, shouting,
and scenes. GRANDOLPH's motion to Report Progress being
negatived on division, PRINCE ARTHUR moved that Chairman
leave the Chair, division on which just tided Committee over
twelve o'clock, without chance of doing more work.
"I feel twelve years younger," said GRANDOLPH, coming
in from last division, "Reminds me of first Session of 1880
Parliament, when we sat below Gangway there, and bandied
about these alternate resolutions, me moving to Report Pro-
gress ; then, when we came back again, Wolffy, GORST, or
sometimes, to give the boy a turn, PRINCE ARTHUR moved
that Chairman leave the Chair. That was long before he
came into his princedom. House of Commons pretty dull
these six years back. After all, it's the same old place, and,
if we give our mind to it, we can have the same old game."
· Business done.-Got into Committee on Home Rule Bill.
Thursday:-Noisiest evening we have enjoyed since Parlia-
ment elected. Peculiarity of situation was that every body,
not excluding Chairman of Committees, strenuously anxious
to preserve order. Quiet enough till CHAMBERLAIN appeared
on scene, then followed the ordinary cool-cucumbery results.
TIM HEALY torn with anxiety that JOSEPH should limit him-
self strictly to Motion before Committee. Sort of triangular
duel; JOSEPH at corner Bench below Gangway to right of
Chair ; Tim in corresponding position opposite; MELLOR in
(and out of) Chair; all three on their feet simultaneously;
WASTED IRONY.
Committee assisting in general desire for peace and order by
tumultuous shouting. TIM fired furiously at JOSEPH ;

alternately at both. ,
"AND ON MONDAY NIGHT !"-"YES, MA'AM."
Then GRANDOLPH, finding temptation irresistible, romped
"Don'T YOU THINK YOU HAD BETTER HAVE A REGULAR DAY AT Home in. I move," he said, that the words be taken down."

there was someone at that temperature. Committee,
take it all together, in volcanic mood. Peculiarity of
situation, as SAUNDERSON put it, with some mixing of
metaphor, was that "it was the cucumber that kept the
pot a-boiling.” Whenever any sign of placidity was
visible, JOSEPH sure to appear on scene, rub someone's

this at the outset, advising them that they
“hadn't a leg to stand upon.” Very little

occasion. The odd part of these Man and

SCENE—The Course on the Derby-Day. Venerable Parliamentary
Chief, GRANDOLMAN, in holiday attire, is greatly enjoying him-
self. The Picnic provender is peculiarly good, and he has just
drawn the Farourite (in his opinion) in a " Derby Sweep.” To
him enters the shrewd, but somewhat sinister-looking GIPSY
JOSEFA, offering venal vaticinations.
Grandolman (impatiently).
On bother! Get out! Don't you see I am busy?
(Aside. Doesn't dress for the part half as well as did Dizzy!)
You tell me my fortune? Oh well, that will keep.
What I want to know now is-my chance in the "Sweep.”
Eh? “Home Rule?” That is luck! I feel sure of my tin,
For I fancy the Favourite will just about win.
Gipsy Josefa (riciously).
GRANDOLMAN, GRANDOLMAN! Beware of the day
When the Lowlands shall meet thee in battle-array!
For a field of defeat rushes red on my sight,
And the clans of Midlothian are scattered in fight.
As I told the good Brums, you won't have half a chance,
When next Scottish warriors against you advance.
They rally, they fight for the Kingdom and Crown;
Woe, woe to the Chief who would trample them down!
But hark! Through the fast-flashing lightning of war
What steed to the desert flies frantic and far ?
'Tis thine, oh GRANDOLMAN! Hibernia shall wait
With a love-lighted watch-fire all night at the gate.
A steed comes at morning: no rider is there!
They who backed that old crook are reduced to despair.
ERIN weeps, to Coercion's captivity led
By the foolish false friends who would give you your head.
For a general “ Get out!” over England shall wave,
And PAT, SANDY, and TAFFY, in vain try to save!
Grandolman (disdainfully).
Oh come, look you here, you 're a nuisance, my girl!
(Aside :- Ab I those are not dear Dizzy's dark eyes and smart cur :)
Go, preach to the coward, you doom-dealing seer,
My horse you won't get at, my book you won't queer!
“Draw, Chief !” cried McCARTHY. And what is my horse ?
“ Home Rule," as you see! A good omen-of course !
Gipsy Josefa (gloomily).
Ha! GRANDOLMAN, thou laughest my vision to scorn!
Proud bird of the mountain thy plume shall be torn.
When next the Old Eagle sails valiantly forth
To the fight 'midst the dark-rolling clouds of the North,
By the fire shower of ruin the Bird shall be driven
From his eyrie, his home near the dark Scottish heaven.
White-crested GRANDOLMAN, the peerless in fight,
You 'll find the derided JOSEFA was right.
With silver she knows you will not cross her palm,
But-she'll tell you your fortune for nothing! 'Tis balm
To the oft-flouted gipsy to picture your fate,
She was too proud to feed on the scraps from your plate !
But the Romany's deep revenge comes—she can wait-
And the Romany's warning you 'll heed—when too late !
Grandolman (defiantly).
False Wizard, avaunt! I have marshalled my clan;
The three hundred and sixty will fight like one man;
They'll be true to the last of their blood and their breath,
And, like reapers, descend to the harvest of death.
Then welcome be SALISBURY's steed to the shock!
If he dash on like foam, he shall find me a rock.
But woe to his kindred, and woe to his cause,

to the claims of justice ?
A. Yes; the Press, when
invoked, possesses the necessary
authority.

Question. What is believed
by many worthy people the
greatest honour on earth ?
Answer. To be elected a Fel-
low of the Royal Society.
Q. What are the qualifications
for such an election ?
A. To be fairly popular with
a narrow clique..
Q. If a candidate does not
possess this popularity, what
may be expect?
A. A hostile circular suggest-
ing, in lieu of his own reception,
the election of someone else.
Q. What is considered a dis- |
qualification for the honour ?
- A. To have contributed to the
newspapers.
Q. Is there no exception to
this rule ?
A. Yes. A scientist may
write letters to the press upon
general subjects if he is careful
to put his name in full, with
initials of his degrees complete.
Q. How long does it take a
man of science, of a retiring
temperament, to become a Fellow
of the Royal Society ?
A. About a quarter of a
century.
Q. Cannot an energetic scien-
tist obtain the distinction in a
shorter period ?
A. Certainly; in about a
twentieth of the time.
Q. Does the election of an
energetio scientist impede the
promotion of outsiders ?
4. Unquestionably, because

that his own election has been
too expeditious, attempts, by
preventing the election of other
candidates, to maintain the

idea. Why not annex to the
Box Office an extra stall for the

brellas ? Also, why not carry
the idea further, and say, on
very wet nights doors open at 7,

at 6:30? Then the Criterion Res-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SHOOTING THE “CHUTES."
O JANE, my gem and jewel bright,
When you proposed that we should go
To Captain Boytor's Water Show
I laughed aloud in wild delight!-
For you are fair—which may explain
Why loving cousins find it sweet
To take you somewhere for a treat,
And blow expenses, pretty JANE!
I robed myself in gallant style-
A new frock-coat I bravely donned,
A waistcoat white (of which I'm fond),
A glossy and convincing tile :
With trousers grey and gloves of suede,
With silken scarf of azure blue,
And buttonhole of crimson hue-
The picture was complete, dear maid.
That Water Show, beyond dispute,
Was worthy Captain BOYTON's fame;
We laughed and cheered as boatloads came
Careering madly down the “Chute"-
But oh! what demon prompted you
In merry moment to suggest
That we-arrayed in Sunday best-
Should make that headlong journey too?
I smiled assent for your dear sake,
And took my seat by side of you,
Then held my breath as down we flew
Towards that cold and cruel lake!
Oh, JANE, we rued our conduct rash,
For endless Time will not expunge
The horror of that awful plunge-
The woe of that colossal splash !
The blinding, beating, drenching spray,
That took the joy from coat and hat-
That laid my collar limp and flat,
Drowned Hope itself that fatal day;
For when we reached the asphalte shore-
All dripping, draggled, wet, and worn-
You sought a cab with queenly scorn,
And drove away for evermore!

And try, despite a bell-shaped gown,
On microscopic feet to toddle ?
