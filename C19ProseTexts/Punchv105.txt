“Who made that stale and inappropriate quotation ? " exclaimed Mr. Oracle Punch, looking severely around the
illustrious group gathered in his sanctum about the brazen tripod which bore his brand-new Phonograph.
Nobody answered.
“Glad to see you are ashamed of yourself, whoever you are," snapped the Seer.
“Rather think the-a-Spook spoke," muttered a self-important-looking personage, obliquely eyeing a shadowy visitor
from Borderland.
Humph! Julia may use your hand, but you will not trump mine," retorted the Oracle. “ If revenants knew what
nonsense is put into their spectral mouths by noodles and charlatans, they would never return to be made spectral pilgarlics of.”
“A ghost is a good thing-in a Christmas story ! " laughed the jolly old gentleman in a holly-crown. "Elsewhere it
is generally a fraud and a nuisance."
Right, Father Christmas!” cried Mr. Punch. “But the Voces from my Oracular Funograph are not ghostly
nothings, neither are they ambiguous, like the oracles of the Sibyl of Cumw,—to which, my eloquent Premier, some have
had the audacity to compare certain of your vocal deliverances."
The Old Oracular Hand smiled sweetly. “ Nescit vox missa reverti,” he murmured. “ Would that EDISON could
invent a Party Leader's Phonograph whose utterances should satisfy at the time without danger of being quoted against one
fifty years later by Cleon the Tanner, or AGORACRITUS the Sausage-Seller, to whom even the Sibylline Books would scarce
have been sacred. But you and your Funograph—as you neatly call it-have never been Paphlagonian, have never had to
give up to Party what was meant for Mankind.”
“And Womankind, surely, Mr. GLADSTONE?” subjoined the Strong-minded Woman, glaring reproachfully through
her spectacles at the Anti-Woman's-Rights Premier. “I wish I could say as much of you, Sir!”
“ Labour and the Ladies seem to have small share in his thoughts," began the Striker, hotly, when Lord ROSEBERY
touched him gently on his fustian-clad shoulder, and he subsided.
“Am I not a lady ?" queried HIBERNIA, with an affectionate glance at her aged champion.
Golly, and me too ?” added a damsel of dusky Libyan charms, clinging close to the stalwart arm of Napoleonic
CECIL RHODES.
" Yes—with a difference !" said the Oracle, drily. " " Place aux damos' is a motto of partial and rather capricious
application, is it not, my evergreen Premier ?"

"A principle of politeness rather than of politics or Parliament—at present," murmured the G. O. M.
" Pooh!” sniffed the Strong-minded Woman. “It will spread. Read Mr. H. FOWLER’s Bill, and Dr. ALFRED
RUSSEL WALLACE's Woman and Natural Selection ; put this and that together, and perpend !"
"The Penny Phonograph," pursued Mr. Oracle Purch, “is now prodigiously patronised. For the popular penny you
can hear an American band, a Chevalier coster ballad, the Charge of the Light Brigade, a comic song by · Little Tich,' or a
speech by the Old Man ele quent. No; for the latter I believe they charge twopence. That is fame, my Pantagruelian
Premier But in my Funograph-charge the unchangeable Threepence—you can hear the very voice of Wisdom and Wit, of
Humanity and Humour, of Eloquence and Essential Truth, of Music and of Mirth!”
“Hear! hear! hear ! ” chorussed everybody.
"You shall hear !" said the Oracle. “Stand round, all of you, and adjust your ear-tubes ! DIONYSIUS's Ear was not

" Nihil—or Nihilism," growled the Trafalgar Square Anarchist, “is the burden of the vox populi of to-day-

"I trust you have guidance for me," murmured gentle but anxious-faced Charity. “It would, like my ministrations,

“Sweet lady," responded the Oracle, with gentle gravity, “there is guidance here for all who will listen; heavenly

(Revised up to Date.)
Question. Is it good for the
health to keep awake ?
Answer. Certainly not; as
sleep is most necessary to the
body's
repose.
Q. Then should one go to sleep?
A. No; for it must in the end
be injurious to the mind.
Q. Is walking a good thing?
A. Certainly not; as it may
lead to cramp:
Q. Is resting to be recom-
mended ?
A. Oh no; for exercise is ab-
solutely a necessity.
Q. Is riding permissible ?
A. Not when the wood pave-
ment produces the new sore throat.
Q. Should we eat ?
A. No; for everything is adul.
terated.
Q. Should we drink?
A. No; liquor is injurious.
Q. Should we starve ?
A. No; meals are really needful.
Q. Is it safe to stay at home?
Ă. No; because change of air
is most beneficial to everyone.
Q. Is it advisable to go abroad?
A. Not at all; many epidemics
are reported to be rife everywhere
on the other side of the channel.
Q. Is it good to live ?
A. Scarcely; because illness is
worse than death.
Q. Is it good to die?
A. Probably; everything else
is a failure, so no doubt this, too,
is a grand mistake.

for putting any private feelings aside, and rallying round him to
show our respect and sympathy. But of course if you're going to
let petty jealousies of this sort get the better of you, and leave me to
do the 'ole thing myself, I've no objection. I daresay he'll value it
all the more coming from me.
Mr. Sitb. Well, he ought to, after the shameful way he's spoken
of you to a friend of mine in the City, who shall be nameless. You

he complained bitterly of having to change his regular train on your

to you to give him the arm-chair.

it was that first started all this tomfoolery about a testimonial, I'm

TASTE
A LONDON PEST.
To an impartial observer
the public, philanthropic, and
municipal attempts to honour
the memory of the great and
good, if sometimes mistaken,
Earl of SHAFTESBURY, appear
to have been singularly un-
fortunate. The West-End
Avenue that bears his name
is more full of music-halls,
theatres, pot-houses, and
curious property. than any
street of equal length and
breadth in the whole Metro-
polis. Lord SHAFTESBURY may
not have been a Puritan, but
he was essentially a serious
man, and his sympathies were
more with Exeter Hall than
with the Argyle Rooms; and
yet, in the street which is
honoared by his name,
it has
been found impossible to re-
move the old title of this
historic place from the stone
facade of the Trocadero.
The fountain at Piccadilly
Circus, which has been un-
veiled as the second of the
SAAFTESBURY memorials, is
surmounted by-what? Some
writers have called it a girl,
some have called it a boy;
many of the public, no doubt.

bird, and it certainly looks

DELENDA EST DRURILANA !
The Drury Lane Committee,
headed by the dauntless JAMES
O'Dowd, have decided upon
approaching the Duke of BED-
FORD with a protest against his
Grace's present expressed in-
tention of pulling down the
Old Theatre within the next
two years. Probably the re-
sult of this, the latest incident
in the interesting annals of
Old Drury, will simply be to
make another addition to the
well-known collection of "Re-

A VISION OF ROYALTY.
I've never seen him face to face, but what's the odds of that ?
(Written after a surfeit of the Nlustrated Papers.)
In illustrated papers I have watched him every day
Since he went and popped the question to the pretty Princess May.
Ye Royalties of England, how beautiful ye are !
The special artists claim you, they track you from afar.
I've seen them plain or coloured in fifty different styles,
In uniforms and diamonds, with sceptre and with crown,'
Just like a pair of turtle-doves, all bills and coos and smiles.
In many a picture-paper those artists set you down.
I never saw a turtle-dove that smiled upon its pet afore,
And thus the British public may gaze upon its Queen-.
But he who writes of bridal pairs is bound to use the metaphor.
They make her small, but dignified, of most majestic mien. Oh, Princess May, oh, Princess May, in crayon or in oil you
She smiles-the artist marks her; she frowns-the artist quails, Are loveable and beautiful, they can't avail to spoil you.

To make you like a stolid block in all their special sketches.
(The point of silver trowels I ne'er could understand);
So this, my meek petition, to those artists is addressed,
He draws him opening railways, or turning sods of grass,
Give Royalties of every sort a little welcome rest.
And he draws him as a Colonel, 'in helmet and cuirasse.
I cannot bear my Royal ones-of loyalty I'm full-
We see him dressed for London, a-riding in the Row-
To look like wax and sawdust, with limbs of cotton-wool.
I wonder if he ever finds his London pleasures slow;
And we see him down at Sandringham, his country-home in Norfolk, and thus, when next you draw them (oh, may the time be long
Where the Royal pair are much beloved, especially by poor folk.
To make them human beings will surely not be wrong..
And if you 'll take a hint from me you'll earn a nation's thanks,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE MAN MAKES THE TAILOR.
(Fragment from a Seasonable Romance.)
It was towards the close of the London season of 1893 that a man
in a strange garb was seen at an early hour in the East End of
London. He attracted considerable attention. It was a rough part
of the City, still, those who lived there were conventional in their
costume. They wore black coats, and there was a certain respecta-
bility about their hats. But the man to whom we refer was eccentric
in the extreme. His straw hat was worn at the back of his head,
his cut-away coat was thrown open, showing a huge, collarless
coloured cotton shirt. He had flannel trousers tucked into digger's
boote. No one knew whence he came, whither he was going.
“Have you noticed bim " asked the Inspector.
"Yes, Şir," replied the Police Constable, he's got white bands,
so if he belongs to the dangerous classes, he is a smasher, or a forger,
or something genteel ip that line.'
"Well, keep your eye upon him."
“I will, Sir."
And the strange-looking person continued his way. As he walked
through the City, the merchants regarded him with surprise, but
there were those amongst the stock brokers who seemed to receive
him with recognition.
"I fanoy I have seen the Johnnie somewhere before," observed one
Member of the House to another. “I am almost sure I know the cut
of his guit."
And the man walked on until he reached Knightsbridge. There
he was stopped by an elderly, well-dressed, well-to-do individual,
who had evidently just come up from the country. The two pedes-
triads started back when they met face to face.
“What are you doing in that hideous disguise ?" asked the senior
of the junior,
“It is no disguise, father," was the reply; "it is only the custo-
mary, get up of a young man of fashion between the hours of pine
and eleven when he proposes to walk in the park."

And, with these words, the strange apparition crossed over the
road, and entered Rotten Row. And here he was soon lost in a

Odd,” says Member for Sark, “how phrases change in similar
circumstances though at different epochs. When Closure first
invented, put in motion by dear OLD MORALITY, and supported
by BARTLEY, AANBURY, JIMMY LOWTHÆR, and the rest, it used
to be spoken resentfully of as 'pouncing.' Now it is 'gag-
ging.' But it is precisely the same, inasmuch as the minority
of the day, against whom it is enforced, denounce it as iniquitous,
whilst the majority, who took that view when they were on
other side of House, now regard it as indispensable to conduct
of public business. BARTLEY having lived through both epochs
is useful illustration of this tendency. When OLD MORALITY
pounced on Irish members his lusty shout of approval used
to echo through House with only less volume than now his roar
of anguish goes up to glass roof when OLD MORALITY's original
thumbscrews are fitted on him and his friends. A quaint,
mad world, my Toby.”
To-night BARTLEY not so well-informed on subject as usual.
Thought it was JOHN DILLON, who, acting the part of AMPHI-

in advance a table for his guests, found when the dinner-hour
struck JOSEPH and his Brethren seated thereat, merrily profiting
by his forethought. Straightway O'BRIEN led his guests to
the table in members' room which Unionist Leaders have
marked for their own. This he appropriated, and there,
regardless of surprised looks from ex-ministers at adjoining

THERE WAS AN OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN HER SHOE,
SHE HAD SO MANY CHILDREN SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ;
SO SHE GAVE THEM SOME BROTH WITHOUT ANY BREAD,

LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST.
MY
ANGELINA once enjoyed
The mild lawn-tennis all the day,
And did not scorn to be employed
In croquet's unexciting fray;
O truly happy seasons, when
I think of you, I wish you back,
For ANGELINA had not then
Become a golfing maniac !
But now of none of these she thinks.
All such pursuits she reckons “slow,”
And spends the days upon the links,
Where nevermore I mean to go:
For I recall the heartless snubs,
Which those enchanting lips let
fall,
When I demolished several clubs,
And lost my temper, and the ball.
To-day the fickle maid prefers
With young MACDOFF to pass her
time,
Because his "putting,” she avers
Whatever that be—"is sublime;
And when I get a chance to state
The deep affection felt by me,
She interrupts me to relate
How well she did that hole in three !
I love my ANGELINA still,
Yet he who chose her as a wife
Would be expected to fulfil
A caddie's duties all his life;
So, if I turn away instead,
You will not hold me much to blame?
How can I woo her? She is wed
Already-to this awful game!

That last phrase didn't sound seafaring, but, as another honest
sailor was accustomed to say, its bearings lay in the application of
it. Motion before House was to eliminate Second Chamber from

difficult for Opposition. If they voted against the Government they
would be declaring against principle of House of Lords. If they voted

PRINCE ARTHUR elaborately explained that in going into Lobby with
the Radicals he was voting against a concrete proposal and in favour

The quarter where I linger,
My square, is Fashion's acme ;
I'm conscious that the finger
Of scorn may well attack me;
At number six a Viscount
Resides, in proper season ;
No wonder, then, that I count
As vulgar now, with reason.
To stay in London, here too!-
This neighbourhood majestic !
Oh! what must it appear to
A nobleman's domestic ?
I feel, I can't help stating,
Each morn I feel (it tries me),
His Lordship's lords-in-waiting
Both pity and despise me.
His blinds are drawn sedately ;
Mine blazon low disaster;
How desolate, how stately,
That mansion mourns its master!
His Lordship is at Como-.
At least so folks are saying ;
His Lordship’s Major-Domo
Reproaches me for staying.
But, prowling, like a Polar
Bear, up and down the pavement

Teeth over forced enslavement,

A “spook,” deserving quires

Till thence, with stealthy twinges,
Emerged what seemed a mortal;
A lamp was nigh to show him,-

Of the joyous time when I joined the inn,
Nearly forty years ago,
When the fire of youth was in my veins,
Where the blood now runs so slow.
'Twas well in that far off happy time,
That I could not see before,
When we flirted and gambled, and some-
times worked,
In the student days of yore.
When all was common to him in need,
And nothing we called our own.
Gone are those days, and can never return-
We reap the crop we have sown.
Each of us thought that we should succeed,
Though others of course might fail ;
And we went with the tide in our youthful
pride,
Like a ship without a sail.
Where are they now all these friends of our
youth?
Scattered abroad o'er the earth.
Some few are famous and some are dead,
And the world knew not their worth.
Some, like myself, are still found in “Hall,”
Pitied by those we meet,
And who pray that their end it may never be
To sit in the ancients' seat.
OH, AMARYLLIS, in the shade
Of Rotten Row, with ribbons, feather,
And wide-spread brim your hat is made!
Down by the sea, in windy weather,
A sailor hat,
So small and flat,
Is far more natty altogether.
Down by, or on, the waves where swim
The tribes which poets christen“ finny,"
This hat might not, with narrow brim,
Become a spinster sear and skinny-
" old cat”-
Nor one too fat,
Nor little brat, small piccaninny.
But, with it fixed upon your hair,
When breezes blow your flapping dresses,
You look, if possible, more fair;
There's one beholder who confesses
He dotes on that
Sweet sailor hat,
When gazing at those sweeter tresses.

Love
pliments! An Adelphi audience personally hate and detest
the stage villain, but for all that, they couldn't do without
him, any more than can the melodramatic author or the Messrs.
GATTI.
After the villain, who certainly holds the first place in popular
unpopularity, comes the Heroic Boy, CHARLES WARNER, all
heartiness and simplicity, a very “bounding. Achilles ;” and
next to him, the suffering heroine who defends herself with a
revolver, who is finally charged with murder, and gallantly
defended by the Heroic Boy, who, attired in wig, gown, and
bands, appears in the last scene of all that ends this eventful
his'tory as Counsel for the Defence, pleading for his wife before
a full court, much less crowded than is the Old Bailey gene-
rally, and apparently far loftier, and much better ventilated.
The case does not attract considerable public attention, as there
is only a sparse attendance of nobodies in the gallery. Through.
out the drama Mr. GARDINER and Miss FANNY BROUGH capi-
tally represent the comic interest, which is brightly written, and
goes” uncommonly well.
The other scoundrel is only young in his villainy–a mere
amateur as compared with Mr. CHARLES CARTWRIGHT, and
were it not for the things he does and says, he might at any
moment be taken for a comedian neither light nor eccentric,
but a fairly all-round and superior sort of ". CHARLES his
friend," whose lines fall in pleasant places as feeders. Poor
Junior Scoundrel! from the first he has no chance of appearing
either gay or light-hearted, as he is invariably at the mercy of
the Senior Rascal, and is finally shot by his own revolver which,
after being used against him on several occasions, for the poor
Junior Rascal never has a chance with it himself, falls into the
hands of aforementioned Senior Rascal, and so he goes to his
dramatic grave without having bad one solitary opportunity
of making a light and airy speech, or doing anything to bring
down the house. He comes in for his share of the hissing, poor
fellow! as does also Miss ALMA STANLEY, in the costume of a
kind of Madame Mephistopheles—a female villain of the deepest
scarlet and black dge. She, too, is one of the trio only created
to be hooted at by an enthusiastically virtuous public. This
monster of female depravity, however, is not a bad sort, and

THE STRIKER'S VADE MECUM.
Question. You think it is a good thing to strike?
Answer. Yes, when there is no other remedy.
Q. Is there ever any other remedy?
A. Never. At least, so say the secretaries.
Q. Then you stand by the opinions of the officials ?
A. Why, of course; because they are paid to give them.
Q. But have not the employers any interests ?
A. Lots, but they are not worthy the working-man's con-
sideration.
Q. But are not their interests yours?
A. Yes, and that is the way we guard over them.
Q. But surely it is the case of cutting off the nose to spite
the mouth?
A. And why not, if the mouth is too well fed.
Q. But are not arguments better than bludgeons ?
A. No, and bludgeons are less effective than revolvers.
Q. But may not the use of revolvers produce the military?
A. Yer, but they can do nothing without a magistrate reading
the Riot Act.
Q. But, the Riot Act read, does not the work become serious ?
A. Probably. But at any rate the work is lawful, because
unremunerative.
Q. But how are the wives and ohildren of strikers to live if
their husbands and fathers earn no wages ?
A. On strike money.
Q. But does all the strike money go to the maintenance of
the hearth and the home?
A. Of course not, for a good share of it is wanted for the
baccy-shop and the public-house.
Q. But if strikes continue will not trade suffer?
A. Very likely, but trade represents the mastere.
Q. And if trade is driven away from the country will i
come back ?
A. Most likely not, but that is a matter for the future.
Q. But is not the future of equal importance to the present ?
A. Not at all, for a day's thought is quite enough for a
day's work.
Q. Then a strike represents either nothing or idleness ?
A. Yes, bludgeons or beer.
Q. And what is the value of reason ?
A. Why, something less than smoke.

But the rest of this marvellous piece of concise reasoning must
remain for ever a secret, for at this moment a bugle-call disturbed
the stillness of the summer night, and HOLEs immediately paused.
“What can that mean P” I asked, in some alarm, for Camberwell
(our meeting place) is an essentially unmilitary district, and I could
not account for this strange and awe-inspiring musical demonstration.
“Hush,” said HOLES, with perfect composure; "it is the agreed
signal. Listen. The great Samovar diamond, the most brilliant
jewel in the turquoise crown of Hungary, has been lost. The
Emperor of AUSTRIA is in despair. Next week he is due at Pesth,
but he cannot appear before the fierce and haughty Magyars in a
crown deprived of the decoration that all Hungary looks upon as
symbolical of the national existence. A riot in Pesth at this moment
would shake the Austro-Hungarian empire to its foundations. With
it the Triple Alliance would crumble into dust, and the peace of
Europe would not be worth an hour's purchase. It is, therefore,
imperative that before the dawn of next Monday the diamond should
be restored to its wonted setting.'
“My dear HOLES," I said, "this is more terrible than I thought.
Have they appealed to you, as usual, after exhausting all the native
talent ?”
“My dear Potson,” replied my friend, "you ask too much. Let
it suffice that I have been consulted, and that the determination of
the question of peace or war lies in these hands." And with these
words the arch-detective spread before my eyes those long, sinewy,
and meditative fingers which had so often excited my admiration.
Our preparations for departure to Hungary were soon made. I
hardly know why I accompanied HOLES. It seemed somehow to be
the usual thing that I should be present at all his feats. I thought
he looked for my company, and though his undemonstrative nature
would never have suffered him to betray any annoyance had I
remained absent, I judged it best not to disturb the even current of
bis investigations by departing from established precedent. I
therefore departed from London-my only alternative. Just as we
were setting out, HOLES stopped me with a warning gesture.
A NEAT WAY OF PUTTING IT.

" What clue?”

of faded green ribbon which happened to be lying on the pavement.
No. V.-THE HUNGARIAN DIAMOND.
“The very thing," said HOLES, pocketing it, and so we started.
EVERYBODY must remember the apparently causeless panic that Our first visit on arriving at Pesth was to the Emperor-King, who
seized the various European governments only a few years ago. It was living incognito in a small back alley of the Hungarian capital,

the splashing, and the people on board do the ducking.

well at first, but who turn all sorts of colours within a quarter of

(By a Tenant.)
Who asked a rent absurdly high ;
Who never scrupled at a lie ?
The house well built! The soil so
dry ! My Landlord.

The house will fall about my ears?

The ceilings show damp, mould,

Who called the house extremely

It's simply overrun with mice,

Who praised the garden in a way
To seem like Eden? I should say

Yet when I sow the choicest seeds
They all develop into weeds.

MY TENANT.
(By a Landlord.)
Who haggled long about the price ;
Who says my house is far from nice;
Who seeks solicitor's advice?
My Tenant.
Who wants incessantly repairs
To floors and ceilings, steps and stairs;
Who doats on hygienic scares ?
My Tenant.
Who lives in fear of sewer gas,
So that the plumbers soon amass
Vast sums, once mine? That utter
ass,
My Tenant.
Eternally some fresh complaint;
Distemper, whitewash, paper, paint!
He is enough to vex a saint-
My Tenant.
Who lets the garden go to pot ?
What used to be a pleasant spot
Is worse than an allotment plot.
My Tenant.
Deferring payments suits his bent;
When various demands I've sent;
Unwillingly he pays the rent,

A Dialogue in Dialect, some way after Bret Harte's "Jim.”
[Referring, in the course of conversation, to the deadlock in the Senate,
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said :-“My opinion is that the Americans are the most
patient people on the globe. Such an outcome from an organised system of
obstruction would be impossible in England, which I venture to say, with
my foot on New York soil, is far more democratic than America. Democrary,
as I take it, means the government of the people by the people.”—The
“ Times'" New York Correspondent, Oct. 13.]

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
BARABBAS is a romance by MARIE CORELLI, founded upon the
narrative given by the Four Evangelists. It is in three volumes, and
Barabbas is the principal character. Oratorios have been com-
posed musically illustrating the sacred story, mystery plays there
have been showing it forth in action, but never yet have we been
taken, as it were, behind the scenes, introduced to Judas ISCARIOT's
sister, and been informed as to the motives of human action under-
lying "the World's Tragedy." Whether "the stock of Barabbas "
hath been sold out or not, the Baron cannot imagine that this novel
form of treating Holy Writ will ever be popular with any section
of our ordinary reading public. MARIE CORELLI is a writer as
picturesque as prolific, but she has wasted her time and talents on
this romance. There used to be a perversion of the text, which
took this form, “Now BARABBAS was-a publisher” (was it SYDNEY
SMITH'S jest?); but if that applies nowadays, the publisher who
depended solely upon this particular work for his success would,
probably, far nearer resemble Zaccheus than BARABBAS, inasmuch
as he might find himself “up a tree.”
Catriona is written by R. L. STEVENSON, and published' n one
volume by CASSELL & Co. “Aweel, aweel, mon !" quoth the Baron,
after several praiseworthy attempts at mastering the Scotch dialect
in which the story is told"; "aweel, aweel! I am swier to leave ye,
Catriona ! But it maun be as it will; I'm nane sae muckle learned
in your Scotch tongue; sae I'll e'en put doun the book, or I'll be
wearyful, deil hae 'ti" No: Scotch the Baron cannot manage-
except taken as whiskey. But he will tell those who love the language
that McSTEVENSON'S
Catriona they will enjoy to their heart's content.
All the same it remains a mystery to the Baron de B. W.

TO A LOST FRIEND.
(By a Briefless Barrister.)
No more! alas! completely gone,
No shadow of a trace is left,
And I have still to linger on,
Of your companionship bereft,
And fight the battle to the end,
As best I may with one less friend.
It seems a cruel stroke of Fate.
How eagerly I watched you grow!
How much I loved you ; how elate
When other people came to know
On what I always had insisted-
That you in point of fact existed.
I played with you, who every day
Grew more responsive to my touch.
I stroked you in the gentlest way,
With sweet caresses. Ah! how much
We seemed, as though a child and mother,
To be bound up in one another.

It also was they hung on you.
And then one day you disappeared,
Cut off in life's most sunny prime.

Here were heaps of British goods suddenly endowed with the
power of speech, and yet she could not understand them!
And as she considered, the little old lady again appeared.

seem perplexed! Have not all the toys been talking
?”
“Why, yes,” faltered ALICE; “but then you see I cannot under-

"Of course you cannot,” replied the Fairy. “They speak only
their native language."
“Their native language! Then why don't they speak English ?”
“Because, my good girl," returned the Fairy, preparing to take
her departure, "they cannot. You see, young lady, they don't

(Whose "Fringe" has fallen off

Alas! those waving ourls,
That parting on your brow,
Had been some other girl's !
“Vhere ish dot barting now?"
Like BREITMANN's barty gone
Avay in eroigkeit,
Those curls which you put on
To grace the ball to-night.
Too feeble were the pins,
Too frisky were your hops ;
Derisive are the grins,
Departing parting drops.
A parting, this, that shocks
Beholders evermore;
Yon dare not claim those locks
Now lying on the ficor.
I used to think them fair,
I find them false instead;
If thus you lose your hair,
I shall not lose my head.
Nor certainly my heart,
With that I should not care
So readily to part
As you with purchased hair.
We kick those curls aside.
Your looks and locks have fled,
Then hasten home to hide
Your much diminished head.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
A PERUSAL of Captain LUGARD's Rise of our East African Empire fills one
with a thrill of pride at being also an Englishman. Captain LUGARD is a
Soldier of Fortune, of the type of Quentin Durvard, only, instead of lending
his sword to a foreign king, he helps to carve out empire for England in the
very heart of Africa. This is, however, merely an accident. He reached
Massowah bent upon joining the Italian forces, then fighting against the
Abyssinians. This journey was undertaken for what, to my Baronite's peace-
loving disposition, is the oddest reason in the world. Finding himself with his
regiment at Gibraltar in December 1888, his health shattered in the Burmah
campaign, Captain LUGARD came to the conclusion that nothing would do him
good except a little fighting: So, with £50 in his belt, and no outfit except
his rifle, he got on board the first passing ship, and sailed whithersoever it
chanced to be going. This turned out to be Naples, a fortunate stroke, since
Italy was the only nation that chanced at the moment to be at war. Captain
LUGABD's efforts to obtain permission to join the expeditionary force, made
first at Rome, and afterwards at Dogali, were unsuccessful. He drifted into
East Africa, and finally reached Uganda, with which territory, particularly
interesting just now, much of the book is concerned. It is impossible even to
hint at the marvellous adventures through which he made his way. They
were accomplished with marvellous endurance and superb courage, the pic-
turesque narrative being written with charming modesty. No more stirring
story has been told in recent years than Messrs. BLACKWOOD publish in these
two handsome volumes, profusely illustrated and enriched with maps.
A few hints to those about to marry in Courtship and Marriage, by ANNIE
Swan. Miss ANNIE SWAN is a Duck!
The latest “Outs" published by “INNES are The Dainty Books, a charm-
ing series, containing some very pretty stories; that of a little girl, always aiming
at dramatic effects, in A Hit and a Miss, by the Hon. Eva KNATCHBULL-
HUGESSEN, is most amusingly told, and The Lily and the Water Lily is a
delicate flowery romance by Mrs. A. COMYNS CARR, in which flowers and
fairies talk and act for the benefit of some little children.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A CHANCE FOR THE BRIEFLESS.
DEAR MR. PUNCH, -I am a
brieflegs barrister, and I wish to
throw myself upon your gener-
osity by asking you to allow me
to make a suggestion which will
be of great public interest, and
incidentally help me to make my
fortune. All London to-day is
placarded with a thrilling pioture
of the Law-Court Scene in A
Woman's Revenge. My sugges-
tion is – Why not have real
barristers ? The theatre to-day
is nothing if not realistic. Drury
Lane has its race-horses. Ibsenity
its ghosts—why should not the
Adelphi take the town by storm
with its barristers ? The actor
may, no donbt does, act the part
admirably, but who can contend
that he can possibly do so as well
as could a real, actual barrister,
who would know that he was
striving not merely for the ap-
plause of the moment, but for the
guinead briefs of the future? If
Messrs. GATTI will undertake to
accept the plan, I will undertake
to provide the barristers. The
programme would then run :-
Sir John Blacklock, Q.C. (Counsel
for the Crown). Mr.
A. B., 102, Temple Gardens,
Temple, E.C.
What we briefless barristers
want in these hard times is merely
the chance. I look to Messrs.
GATTI to give it to us. I ought
to add that the above address,
though, in point of fact, it is my
own, is given purely by way of
illustration, and in no way to
advertise myself, though should
anyone wish to consult - again, of
course, purely with reference to
this suggestion-the way to my
chambers from the Strand is down
Middle Temple Lane, whilst the
Temple Station is just three
minutes' walk. I am, Sir, your
obliged servant.
L. ERNED COUNSEL.

THE LOST SMELL.
[The Queen's Hall is at present free
from the smell of cooking hitherto
“the inseparable accompaniment of
orchestral music.”—Times, Nov. 27.]
SEATED to-day at a concert,
I am weary and ill at ease,
Though LLOYD and ALBANI are
singing,
Or anyone else you please ;
I know not what they are doing,
For something is wanting
there-
[odour
That old-fashioned concert-hall
Which throbbed in the scented
air.
It flooded the place, like one of
BEETHOVEN's sonatas might,
And it lay on my fevered spirit
With a touch of wild delight;
It quieted pain and sorrow,
It thrilled the enraptured sense,
A song without words 3-or music
That travelled one knew not
whence ;
It linked all delightful odours
Into one perfect peace,
And trembled away into soup-
plates
As if it were loth to cease.
I have sought-but I seek it
vainly-
That one lost smell sublime.
Which came from adjacent kit-
chens
At dinner or supper time.
It may be that CHOPIN is severed
From scents which with music
we group,
It may be that SCHUBERT is parted
For ever from odours of soup.

To-night Henry FOWLER took mean advantage of the suitor. That
person bad amendment on paper which if added to Bill meant nothing
worse than surplusage. Rising from his usual place at back of
Court, he began prodigious speech in support of amendment.
Expected, in accordance with usage, to go on for quarter of an
hour or twenty minutes; FOWLER would say couldn't accept
Amendment; TOMLINSON would talk for quarter of an hour; perhaps
Cap'en Tommy Bowles, having clapped the pilot in irons, would
put in an oar; and HANBURY might say a few words. Then WALTER
Long or Hicks-Beach would rise from Front Opposition Bench,
protest fullest appreciation of Amendment, declara it indispensable
to success of Bill, but in circumstances, observing obstinacy of
Minister, and impatience of gentlemen below Gangway opposite,
advise hon. friend not to press it. THE MAN FROM SHROPSHIRE
would make another speech, thanking right hon. friend for his
remarks, in deference to which he will withdraw, although-

Shrewsbury to Wem. Thus an hour pleasantly and agreeably
disposed of, MAN FROM SHROPSHIRE takes breath, not that he
wants it; a little later, comes up frowning with another Amend-
ment, or a rambling speech
in support of one moved by TOMLINEON.
FOWLER's strategy deprived him of this accustomed round of
luxury. But if President of Local Government Board thought he
had circumvented THE MAN FROM SHROPSHIRE he was as mistaken
as the Chancellor in another court who used to stare at the ruined

instead of lengthening sittings, he will not rather shorten them.
Expected when Mr. G. rose he would make obvious retort that

we do meet the right prevails.

Justice. I have to call your

Law. Your servants are noted
for their good works.
Justice. You are very kind.
Well, these good servant have
defended the poor, protected the
weak, and denounced hypocrites.
Law. Very right indeed. But
how did they manage it without
my assistance ?
Justice. You have a short
memory. It was with your aid
that they brought these good
things about. Surely you have
not forgotten them ?
Law. Well, since I have been
combined with Equity I have
been doing 'so much excellent
work that I have neither time nor
inclination for the recording of
details. Well, and your protégés,
were they successful ?
Justice. Certainly; they won
all along the line. Never was the

THE STOUT SINCER'S SMILE.
O BUXOM maiden, blithe and
gay,
With movements light and
airy,
Some five-and-twenty stone you
weigh,
Fair, fat and forty fairy!
A fairy of the music-halls,
Some men might call you rip-
ping;
In tights, and satin coat and
smalls,
You enter, gaily skipping.
It is not that which brings me
joy,
Nor face, nor form entrances,
It is your smile, so very coy,
Your bashful, girlish glances.
Some twenty years ago, no
doubt,
You were a slender maiden,
But now, so long you have been
With weight of years you 're
laden.
So when you sing of love-sick
grief,
And smile so very sweetly,
I, too, behind my handkerchief,
Smile quite unseen, discreetly.
The more you sing the more you
smile,
Stout charmer, winsome, win-
ning,
Dressed like Lord Fauntleroy-
meanwhile,
Like Cheshire Cat I'm grin-
ning.
Then comes the end ; you curtsy
low,
With looks to heaven soaring ;
You are extremely funny so,
I'm positively roaring.
They clap, they shout, they
thump the floor,
These "gents" serenely smok-

You kiss your hand, smile yet
once more,
And leave me simply choking.

is deserving of censure, surely
some public notice should be
taken of the insult offered to the
Scotch, Welsh, Irish, and Manx
nations by Lord Nelson in his
celebrated signal. That signal
should surely have run:-“Eng-

What memories of the past bring in its train ?
Is it a whiff of country come to-day,
Of mangel-wurzels, or of new-mown hay ?
Or was it when She witched me with a glance
The subtle odour reached me-at the dance ?
Where it was, I'm certain that I know it,
As certain as I am I'm not a poet,
But stay, was it when influenza gripped us ?
It was! Eureka! Yes, it's Eucalyptus!

MAXWELL has had full access to his correspondence and journals.
Uses them with great discretion; they bring into mellow, clear
light the capable, unselfish, courageous man, ever following the
loadstar of Duty. House of Commons used to smile when OLD
MORALITY, faced by any difficulty or dilemma, talked about his
“duty to his QUEEN and country." In his private letters he does
not put it in that oratorical form. But they are full of references to
the calls of duty. Stricken with a painful malady, worn in body
and wounded in spirit, OLD MORALITY still sturdily trod the narrow
path. There is little doubt
that had he, two years before
the end came, retired from the
Leadership of the House of Com-
mons his genial presence might
have been with us to-day. But
he was wanted at his post, and
he stuck to it.
Writing on the 17th March,
1889, he says: “We have trouble
in politics, and I am very weary.
But I must go on doing my daily
work as best I can, looking for
guidance and wisdom where alone
it can be had until my rest comes."
This cry for rest was always
sounding, through day and night.
A few weeks earlier he wrote to
another friend: "I can say God
help me. He will take me out of
my work when I am no longer re-
quired, and then will come rest."
His last appearance in a semi-
official capacity was in July, 1891,
when he went to Hatfield to meet
the German Emperor. In the last
letter written to his wife he says,
“Observing I looked tired last
night, Lady SALISBURY urged me
to go to bed early: which I did.”
