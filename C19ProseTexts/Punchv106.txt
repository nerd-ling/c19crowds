PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

T too, my Lord, 'am not ashamed to be the owner of a good horse,' " said Mr. PUNCH, patting the spotted Hanks of
_L his own immortal and invincible steed, and addressing the lucky owner of the triply victorious Ladas.
The scene was the loose box of the Spotted One. The Lord of Fleet Street, Everywhere, and the Adjacent Islands,
was piloting the Lord of Dalmeny, and the Liberal Party, round his stables.
The smooth-faced and youthful-looking rival of ALEXANDER of Macedon fixed his steady eyes almost enviously on the
Steed of Steeds. "Humph!" he murmured. "A blend of Bucephalus, Pegasus, Ladas, and SINOS'S Trojan 'crack'!!
Something like a Favourite!!! Are you disposed to make a match, over any course you like, for any stakes you please,
Mr. PUNCH? Weight for age of course!"
"I love Sport and hate Speculation," answered the owner of the Spotted One, simply.
"Ah !" began the owner of Ladas, " the Nonconformist Conscience"
"Hates loth," interjected Mr. PUNCH. "There 's the difference! I 'm with it in denouncing gambling; dead
against it spitting sectarian spleen at honest sport. What you aptly called the Blue-Book and Biscuit theory of life is not
mine. But I 've no desire to make Spots 'a contemptible method of appropriating other people's money." Besides, my PRIM-
ROSE, even Ladas wouldn't have a look-in with him, and he couldn't be handicapped down to Matchbox."
"I suppose not," responded Bonny DALMENY, meditatively. "One doesn't pit Pegasus against a mere Derby
champion, eh? If you did, 'twere easy to ' spot the winner'!"
"Did I race him, the winner would always be spotted," chuckled the Sage, stroking the Steed of Steeds affectionately.
"Ah! might call that the Spot-stroke !" muttered the grave-eyed Peer, falling—with a blush—into the light, jesting
mood so objectionable to the heavy-handed Hugh Prics-Hugheses of his party. He glanced round furtively, to make sure
he was not overheard by some eavesdropping member of the great Anti-Laughter League. "Who are these, Mr. PUNCH?"
he queried, sotto voce, pointing to two somewhat shadowy shapes, both in classic costume, and one (a lithe, athletic figure,
with a pose like that of the herald Mercury) in remarkably little of it.
The shorter, yet somewhat more stately and impressive of the two, responded. "The Shades are sombre, and
Charon's Ghosts are generally grave; but it were ' bad form ' to bring the gloom of the Stygian groves into the stables of
Mr. PUNCH."
"The Mighty Macedonian, I presume ?" said Mr. PUNCH, bowing with more than Stanleyish grace.
ALEXANDER nodded assent. "Very nice of you," he said, turning to Mr. PUNCH'S guest, " to name your fleet runner
after mine, my Lord! Pity you have not any MYRONS to immortalise your great men—and horses."
"Humph !" said Mr. PUNCH. "We are certainly not strong in sculpture, just at present. But I 'd back my own
classic and sculpturesque Cartoonist against all your MYRONS at' immortalising' Me and my Spotted One—in black and
white, which perhaps is sometimes better than brass, whatever Academies may think 1"

[JuxE 30, 1894.
The Macedonian bowed in respectful assent. "PfliDUs himself," he said, " would cordially have shaken hands with
your world-renowned artists. But we managed these things differently in Greece!"
"Very," said LADAS, with emphasis. "Would herald-honour, a laurel, a pine, or a parsley crown, even plus a brazen
statue on the Thames Embankment, satisfy your ' Sportsmen,' whether patrons or competitors?"
"I fear not," said Mr. PUNCH, pensively. "I fear that what jovial Sir JOHN ASTLEY calls ' the merry monk' hath
too great charms for our ALEXANDERS and LADASES. So far the rather queasy and querulous Nonconformist Conscience is in
the right of it. Grasping greed and sordid speculation are our true spoil-sports!"
"A good horse," said the Macedonian, " is only second in interest to a ' good man'—in the sporting, not the ethical,
sense bieu entendii. Bucephalus was a good horse. So is Ladas. So, in excelsis, is the Spotted One!"
"Pity you can't put him to the stud, Mr. PUNCH," interjected the PHEMTER. "That would indeed effect what our
chaffing CHAPI.INS humorously ' spoof about, namely, ' improve the breed of horses.'"
They all, Sage, Statesman, and Shades, laughed aloud at this. Even the Spotted One whinnied joyously, and TOBY
yapped gleeful derision, at a fine old crusted sample of conventional cant.
"The Horse," said MB. PUNCH, drily, "is (as the classic quotation hath it) ' a noble creature,' and very useful to Man,
'but if you treat him badly' (i.e. as a mere medium for greedy and dishonest gambling), 'he will not do so.' Your ultra-Puritan
is a ' prig ' of one sort. But unfortunately your Sportsman is too often a ' prig ' of another. DJWII with both! PRIMROSE,
my fortunate triple-eventer, you are Reformer as well as Sportsman. If you can reform in Sport as well as Politics, you '11
'cut the record,' conciliate the Nonconformist Conscience, and deserve a Myron statue, not bra/en but golden, as the modern
Hercules, cleansing the Augean Stables of Turf corruption, a corruption crescent and clinging, ugly and ubiquitous, creeping
upwards and downwards, from Publican to Peer, and from Betting-man to Boot-black!"
"And then," snid Olympian LADAS, smiling, " the suitable reward of the victors in your games will be, not a parsley
but a Primrose crown!"
"Euge, Laconian !" cried Puxcmus, admiringly. "Meanwhile I'll present each of you with that best Sportsman's
Hook, truest Turf-Oracle, and most trustworthy Tipster's Guide, which is published twice a year by the owner of that real
'Horse of the Century,' my champion ' Spotted One '!"
And therewith Mr. PUN^II handed to each of his visitors a handsomely bound copy of his

VERSES A LA CARTE.
(A New Year's Greeting.)
Mr dear Miss TR.\ VERS. H'm! that's stiff;
I wonder now if sudden death '11
Befall your humble servant if
I boldly dare to call you ETHEL.
Enclosed herewith please find a card,
Which as we shan't, alas! be meeting,
(Though you, perchance, don't think it hard)
Is meant to give a New Year's greeting.
What would you like in '94?
A lot of fun? A round of pleasure?
May yours be all you wish, and more—
Pressed down and overflowing measure.
Ere '94 is dead and done,
And our aceo" of Life is carried
To one more _ ju may be won,
And even—tuc.,,r a it sounds odd—married.
What! you have sworn n solemn oath
That marriage vows you "11 not commingle,
That you will never _plight your troth,
But dying be, as living, single?
Well, ETHEL, I quite understand.
'Twas ever thus. And one fine morning
You '11 wake to find your heart and hand
Are gone without the slightest warning.
If I were not upon the shelf,
Removed from masherdom and chappieness,
I 'd help you break your vows myself
If you 'd permit me so much happiness.
Well, anyhow, in this New Year,
Good luck attend your each endeavour,
And recollect you have a dear,
Devoted friend in me for ever.
P.8.
If vou (two verses back) should find
That I was wrong in self-dispraise. Oh!
Tben if you 're what I think you—kind,
Please send me just a word to say so.

DEAR ANGELINA, you are mine,
The dearest, sweetest, loveliest, fairest
Of all the girls. Your face divine,
Of all the faces quite the rarest.
With thoughts of vou, my ownest own,
My brain is nearly always teeming,
When I 'm with others or alone.
By night or day, in waking, dreaming.
I am a lucky man indeed,
In fact, we 're well and truly mated,
And all the world is quite agreed
We 're both to be congratulated.
I 'm yours, you 're mine for aye. Yet stay
I 'd have you know of one small thing. Lei's
Have no mistake. We part the dav

DEAR EDWIX, I 'm content with you,
I love you, sweetheart, more th'an ever,
You '19 all you should be—gallant, true,
Affectionate, devoted, clever,
Mv beau ideal of a man.
Dear, if we ever should be parted
I feel quite certain that my plan
Would be to perish broken-hearted.
Still, darling, I would have you know—
You always listen, dear, to reason—
There is one danger, sweet, and so
Just heed, my own, this word in season.
My happiness is much to me,
And no sane girl would care to risk hers

Your ways are ill-behaved beyond excuse?
Though doubtless spring's delights may

You drive the figure-skater to despair!

TRICOUPPS COUP; OR, THE GREEK MICAWBER AND HIS CREDITORS.
(Adapted from that great, if genial, Economist, "David CojtperficM.")

["The insolvency which M. THH OUPI contemplates with so much philo-
sophic cahu. . . . Hie soothing assurance* of M. Tuicon*! amount to very
little. ... As there was to he bankruptcy, M. TUICOUFI apparently thought
it might as well be carried out on a magnificent scale. . . . Thirty per cent,
was accordingly offered to the creditors, not as being the most Greece could
pay, but as a sort of bid for a settlement that would relieve her from the
necessity of paj'ing any more."—

expenditure, twenty millions ought and six; result, misery! The

in his way; but he applies that maxim very imperfectly. Now, I
propose to work it out consistently, at the expense—well, of all whom
it may concern. My advice is, never to pay to-day what you can put
off till—say, the middle of next week. By that time something may
—well, in point of fact, something may, and in all probability will,
turn up!"
"Just so," returned Mrs. MICAWBEB. "It is precisely that. And
the fact is that we can not live without something widely different j
from existing circumstances shortly turning up. Now I am con-'
vinced myself, and this I have pointed out to Mr. MICAWBEH several I
times of late, that things cannot be expected to turn up of them- }
selves. We must, in a measure, assist to turn them up. I may be
wrong, but I have formed that opinion. I am aware that I am
merely a female, and that a masculine judgment is usually con-
sidered more competent to the discussion of such questions."
"I have no scruple in saying, in the presence of my friends here,"
said Mr. MICAWBEB, "that I am a man who has. for some years,
contended against the pressure of pecuniary difficulties. Sometimes
I have risen superior to mv difficulties. Sometimes my diffi-
culties have—in snort, have floored me. There have been times
when I have administered a succession of facers to them; there have
been times when they have been too many for me, and I have given
in, and said to Mrs. MICAWBEK, in the words of CATO, 'It must be
so! PLATO, thou reasonest well. It's all up now. I can show
tight no more.' I am constrained to admit that such a moment is the
present."
"Mr. MICAAVBEE'S difficulties are almost overwhelming just at
present," said Mrs. MICAWBEK. "If Mr. MICAWBER'S creditors will
not give him time, they must take the consequences; and the sooner
they bring it to an issue the better. Blood cannot be obtained from
a stone; neither can more than THIKTY PEE CENT.'—on account—be
obtainad at present from Mr. MICAWBEK!"
"Thirty per cent.," said Mr. MICAWBEB, solemnly, "is—save to
bloodsucking bondholders and grasping creditors—no trifle! And I
need hardly say that should anything turn up in the.early or more
remote future—of which at present I am exceedingly sanguine—
MICAWBEE would be the last man in the world to wish to play the
classical part of Grceculas esuriens. And then." added Mr.
MICAWBEE, "I have no doubt I shall, please Heaven, begin
to be beforehand with the world, and to live in a perfectly new
manner, if—in short, if anything turns up!"
"I will never desert Mr. MICAWBER," cried Mrs. MICAWBER, with
effusion. "Mr. MICAWBEE has his faults. I do not deny that
he is improvident. I do not deny that he has kept me in the dark as
to his resources and his liabilities both; but I will never desert
Mr. MICAWBER. No!" cried Mrs. MICAWBEH, more affected than
before; "I will never do it! It's of no use asking me!"

BROWN, JONES, [and ROBINSON discovered discussing the state of the
Navy in a first-class compartment.
Brown. My dear fellows, I can assure you we are in a terrible
condition of unpreparedness. If France was to declare war to-morrow
we should be nowhere—absolutely nowhere!
Jones. You mean, of course, with Russia ?•
Robinson. Or was it Italy?
Brown. It doesn't matter which. I fancy that France alone
could tackle us. Why, a man was telling me the other day that
if Gibraltar was seized—as it might be—we should not get a shipload
of wood for months—yes, for months! . •
Jones. But what has Gibraltar to-do with it?
Robinson. Why, of course it guards our approaches to the Suez
Canal.
Brown. Oh. that's only a matter of detail. But what we want is
a hundred millions to be spent at once. COBDEN said so, and I agree
with COBDEJC.
Jones. But upon what?
Robinson. Oh, in supporting the Sultan, and subsidising the
Ameer.
Brown. I don't think that sort of thing is of much importance.
But if we had a hundred millions (as Mr. COBDEN suggested), we
might increase our coaling stations, and build new ships, and double
the navy, and do all sorts of things.'
Jones. But I thought we were fairly well off for coaling stations,
had lots of ships on the stocks, and, with the assistance of our
Merchant Marine, an ample supply of good sailors.
Robinson. That's what all vou fellows say! But wait till we have
a war, and then you will see the fallacy of all your arguments. No,
we should buy the entire fleet of the world. There should be no
other competitor. BRITANNIA should really rule the waves.
. Brown. Yes, yes. Of course; but after all that is not the im-
portant matter. What we want is a hundred millions available to
be spent on anything and everything. And it's no use having
further discussion, because that was COBDEN'S view of it, and so it
is mine.
Jones. But where is it to come from—out of the rates?
Brown and Robinson (together). Certainly not.
Jones. Or the taxes?
Brown and Robinson (as before}. Don't be absurd.
Jones. AVell, it must come from somewhere! Can you tell me
where?
Robinson. Why should we?
Broii-n. Yes, why should we? Even COBDES didn't go so far as
that, and But here we are at the station.

MGHER UP!
(A Sketch Outside an Omniims.)
The Omnibus is on its progress from Piccadilly to the Sank; the
treather is raw and unpkasant, and the occupants of the garden-
seats on the roof of the rehicle are—for once in a way—mostly
men.
First Passenger (to Second, an acquaintance). I sec young BASH-
AWAY the other day. (Significantly.) Jest been to see his father,
so he told me.
•Second Passenger (trith interest). 'Ad he though? And 'ow did
he find him?
Pint P. Fustrate, young JIM said; didn't know when he 'd
seen him lookin' better—(trith sentiment)—quite like his old self!
Second P. (heartily). That is good 'earin', that is! (Reflectively.)
Seems rum, though, come to think of it.
First P. 'Ow a' yer mean—rum? It's no more than what yer 'd
expectj bein' where he is. Look at the air o' the place—there ain't
a 'elthier situation all round London, to my mind!
Second P. No, that's right
enough, and, from all I 'ear, the
food's well cooked, and served
reg'lar, if it is plain.
First P. Ah, and BILL enjoys
his meals now, he does—the work
gives him a appetite, and it's
years, to my certain knowledge,
since he done a stroke, and o
course he ain't allowed no
drink
Second P. And that's enough,
of itself, to be the savin' of 'ini,
the way he was!
First P. Then, yer see, there's
the reg'lar hours, and the freedom
from worrv, and the like, and
nothink on his mind, and the place
with every sanitary improvement
and that—why. he owns his own
self it 'a bin the makin' of 'im.
And from what young JIM was a;
tcllin' me, it appears that, if
BILL goes on gittin* good-eonduck
marks at the rate he 'a doin',

to 'im when he's done his time

Second P. (sympathetically).
Well, and that makes suthin' to
look forward to, don't it, when
he does git let out. Talkin' o'
that, you 've known 'im longer
'n what I 'ave. Do you 'appen
to know what it was as he got

First P. (with the conscious-
ness of superior delicacy). Lor'

'ow yer put a question o' that
sort.

common ground). I see you 're a Conservative—like myself.
The Contrad. P. That's jest where you're wrong.' I ain't no
Conservative, nor yet 1 don't want none o' GLADSTONE neither.
I'm a Radikil, 7 am. JOHN Bvitxs and BEN TILLETT—that's

every man 's got a right to form his own opinions, ain't he?
The Contrad. P. No, he ain't—not if he goes and forms icrong
'uns! (A pause.) 'Ave yer got the time about yer?
The Chatty P. (accepting this as a sign of softening). I 'm sorry
to say I come out without my watch this morning, or else But
there's plenty o' clocks about as '11 tell yer.

You heard, with sore dismay,
That Parliament could scarce adjourn,
This year, o'er Christmas Day.

Now you 've come back to Parliament,
It seems you've come to play
Still at Obstruction's sad, bad game.
To loiter and delay;
To fudge, and tib, and snap, and sneer,
Just in the old, old way.
That's not tidings of comfort and joy!
Still BOWLES blares on, still BARTLF.Y jaws,
Still twitters TOMLINSON:
Hour after hour about one Clause
They hammer on, on, on!
"Amending " purely fancy flaws,
Till FoWLEE 8 chance seems gone.
Is that tidings of comfort and joy?
Ah, would some strong man rise and smash
This stale sophistic sham,
The taradiddles and the trash
Expose as faction's flam;
Brummagem bare, and Bunkum bash,
Oh I that were " real jam "!
True tidings of comfort and joy!
Heaven help the Members of this House,
The Grand Old Man also!
Let the huge Mountain yield its Mouse,
And the tired doctors go j
Obstruction choke and faction chouse,
And shut up spiteful JOE,
And send you all a Happy New Year;.

BOOKING-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE.
A PROPOS of the portrait of the Baron DE BOOK-WORMS in the
Number dated December 23, we have received the following letter of
inquiry:—
Why is the Baron DE BOOK-WORMS this week wearing an Earl's
Coronet? Yours with respect, B. DOD-JUURKE."
Why? Because it is the only one ne has got at home at present;
and by special leave and license all to the contrary, nevertheless and
notwithstanding, the Baron is at full liberty to wear exactly what
best suits him. BARON DE BOOK-WORMS.
SECOND FIDDLES TO THE FORE.
["Seconds were appointed by both parties. They met at Naples on
Saturday, nnd yesterday published their decision, excluding the poisililitj
of a duel between Sipiori SONZOOSO and BoiTo."—Daily Ann.']
SECOND to none in setting matters right,
Seconds to none, as there's to be no right,
lirarissimi! For this relief much thanks."
We liked not these " enraged musicians'" pranks.
Your would-be principals now needn't die
On seeing Naples. You have said " Don't try " ;—
And stopped the "little rift," or big dispute,
Which might indeed have made much music mute.
A SrAGGEKEtt!—"//is official existence being indeed not recog-
nised by statute." We quote from that most useful work Hazell's
Annual for 1894. About whom is this absolutely trustworthy in-
formation given? AVhy, it is concerning the PRIME MINISTER!
Concerning the G. 0. MI! "Ills official existence is not recognised
hi/ statute. But the G. 0. M. is inseparable from WILLIAM LWABT
GLADSTONE. Therefore WILLIAM EWART GLADSTONE is not recog-
nised bv statute! Without his "official existence" he does not
exist. No one can possibly think of him apart from his political
existence. Try it! It can't >c done. It i« unthinkable. But
"Statute Lair" does "not rccognite" him! Statute Law,
then, like Justice, is blind; and so much the worse, perhaps, for
Statute Law. This reduces the Premier to a mere Nobody! He is
the Embodiment, so to speak, of Nobody. Nobody is at the Head of
the Government! Nobody is right, or Nobody is wrong. Here!
Somebody! take us to Hanwell!

Host. "MAT I GIVE YOU SOME ROAST HARE, LADY JONES?"
Master Tommy (Lady Jones's Godson). "AH! / SAW COOK PEEL THAT CAT!"
"COME ABOARD, SIR!"
Captain PUXCH loquitur:—
COJIE aboard, Sir? You're welcome, smart
younker!
You ve hit off the time to a tick.
You're young, hut I trust you're no
funker,
Or apt to turn timid or sick.
For we may have rough weather before
us,
And even a fight mayn't be far.
What odds, if you 're true
To the Red White, and Blue,
The glorious old flag that floats gallantly
o'er us,
0 tiny but stout-hearted Tar?
Y<u're clearly a sea-going "Nipper,"
Unwhiskered, and "only so high."
But you '11 have a tempest-tried skipper;
And don't look like piping your eye.
You seem—like your kit—trim and ready,
Your foot—like the anchor's—a-t rip;
You 're likely and limber,
And sound as oak timber,
With a voice that can join us in "Steady,
bo vs. steady!"
A hand that can fight for the Ship!
Come aboard! Ours will be a long voyage,
One all round the world—and the year,
You 're now at that juvenile-joy age
That feels not foreboding or fear;
You funk not the storm—or the steward—
The mast-head, the rope's-end, the snub.
Like MAHRYAT'S middy,
You sing tiddy-iddy,
And think not of shirking or lurching to
leeward
Should tempests assail the Old Tub!
Quite right! That's the true Tarry
"sperit"
That NKLSON and DruBix proclaimed.
If from Old Salts, and Songs, you inherit
That spirit, you '11 never be shamed.
We hear neaps of chat on the Navy.
No need to be braggart or craven!
If we keep up our pluck,
And our Fleet, with fair luck,
Our goal, boy, will not be the Locker of Davy,
But honour, and home, and safe haven.
Come aboard! Well, the night-watch is set,
boy,
Turn in, and—when wanted—turn out!
No need to "pipe all hands" as yet, boy.
But storms, and strong foes, are about.
At perils nor shrinking nor scoffing,
Our duty 'a to plough on our way,
Steady hand at the wheel,
Dry powder, sharp steel;
And then, lad, if danger should loom in the
offing,
Why, up, boy, and at it! Hooray!!:
THE PIOUS POLYGAMIST.
(New Year's Song of a Hapfy ffusbantl.)
WHEN I arrived at man's estate
And felt I ought to wed,
I knew 'twas a crisis in my fate,
A serious thing to contemplate,
And thus to myself I said:
"You need, of course, a dainty cook,
And a needlewoman, too;
And then, in addition, you want a mu-
sician
To chase the devils blue;
A clever talker, a willing walker,
A capable nurse beside,
A thing of beauty devoted to duty—
And a gentle and charming bride."
AVell, after a time I found my cook
And my needlewoman fair;
I likewise found an excellent nurse
And a lovely girl who could well converse
And play me any air.
I asked them all to be my own,
And they gladly gave consent,
And then together, m finest feather,
To the parish church we went.
And there we tarried until I married
My sempstress, nurse, and cook,
And my other "flames" — and our
several names
Had been entered in the book.
And then we went on our honeymoon,
And then to my Clapham home,
Where the cook prepares me many a dish,
And the artist plays whate'er I wish,
And, should I cnance to roam,
I know the sempstress is well employed
In making my children's dress.
So I needn't worry or be in a hurry,
Or myself in the least distress.
And the nurse is ready, if e'er unsteady
My legs or nerves may be,
With perfect quiet and proper diet
To take good care of me.
So altogether I don't regret
The step I took that dav,
When I married a whole domestic staff,
And I merely regard as so much chaff
What foolish people say
About English wives, and their many
faults—
/ 'm thoroughly well content!
And of any growling or surly scowling
I 'm perfectly innocent.
I 'm happy, very, and blithe and merry,
And if the saying's true
That occupation kills tribulation,
My wife is happy too!

'EN ITERUM!' HERE WE ARE AGAIN!"
WELCOME to our evergreen friends, Clown, Pantaloon, Harlequin,
and Columbine! All of them fresher than ever on the boards of
Old Drury! Some of the genuine "good old " business, too, revived
by Mr. HARRY PAYNE,
which delighteth the
heart of Mr. Punch.
Once more within the
walls of Ancient Drury,
young- and old Drury-
ites joyfully assemble to
acclaim AUGCSTUS DRU-
BiOLANUSthe"P.P.P.P.,"
which, writ large, means
"Punch's Prize Panto-
mime Provider.'"
Peculiar interest (we
hope DRURIOLANUS will
make cent. per cent.) is
attached to this particular
production, seeing it is
announced in the play-
bill as "the last of the
present lease," and of all
the long line of Panto-
mimes, of which this is the
last, most certainly it is j
not the least. But Sir!
DHUIUOLAN us is not to be
evicted, he is to continue
as "The Man in Posses-
sion," the right man in
the right place, and, being
thus re-leased, he isf reeto
remain ad mitltos annos,
and to say most happily
with "theGhost who walk-
ed" in Hamlet, "Leased!
Leased! 0 Leased!"

In Robinson Crusoe, if DBURWLANUS, with his able col/aborateui;
Mr. HARRY NICHOLLS, has not given us quite so much of Robinson
or ot Crusoe as might have been expected, we have a magnificent
spectacle beautiful dresses, forms fairy-like and unfairv-like, and a
wealth of low comedy in Messrs. DAN LENO as Mrs. Crusoe,U.IS&VTXI
"cramming" in English history, so as to be able to answer correctly
the questions that his boys are" safe to put to him; for, should he
hesitate, or be de-
tected in giving ineor-
rectinformation, down
he will go in the esti-
mation of those voung
lads from school, and
the moral effect on
their future will be a
had one. Whereas, if
Pater is spry, and not
only "up-to-date,"
but "up-to-dates,"
those dates being ab-
solutely correct, then
liis visit with his boys
to this Pantomime
will have raised him
fin a higher pedestal
than ever he was be-
fore, and will inspire
his lads with a real
desire to emulate the
rare attainments of
their scholarly pro-
genitor. Paterfamilias
will do well also to
take, or send, them to
see Sandford and
Jferton at a matinee
at the Comedylheatre,
where they will learn
how comically ill-be-
haved two boys can be
who have only that
amount of respect for
their teacher which is
administered with ad-

CAMPBELL as the villain
Atkins, "Little TICH"
as Friday—quite the
shortest day in the year
—and Miss MARIK
LLOYD, looking, as
Polly Perkins, like an
expensive doll. Then
there are Miss JULIA
KENT as Perky Snooks,
and Miss ADA BLANCHE
as the new Robinson,
with others in a full
cast too numerous to
mention individually,
all of whom, with
singing and dancing
and "comic business,"

Pantomime "a going

QUEER QUERY.-CHEAP LITER-
ATURE.—I see that the "Society for
Promoting Christian Knowledge " is
issuing such books as The Talisman
and Robinson Crusoe in a penny
form. Why should some publisher
not start a halfpenny series of equally
valuable works'( For example, 1 am
convinced that my epic poem called Hades Revisited might have
been more popular than it actually was had the natural
eagerness of the masses to obtain a copy not been ruthlessly
checked by the prohibitive price of seven-and-sixpence. There is
also a great future before the Farthing Novelette. I have several
short stories which transcend anything yet done by R. L. STEVENSON,
and which, issued in that shape, would circulate by millions. In
touch-and-go comedy," too, I feel that I could create a furore;
but publishers, to whom I submit my funny talcs, go before they
have touched them!—AUCTOR IGNOTCS.

"PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS CORRUPT GOOD-
LAWYERS,"
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—Though proud of being a member of the same
profession as my good friend Mr. LOCKWOOD, Q.C., M.P., I must
(in the interests of the public) at once protest against one expression
of opinion in a recent Pickwickian lecture. "I can sufficiently
indicate my own feelings," says the Recorder of York, "when I say
that any system which prevents a litigant having the fullest per-
sonal communication with the person he has paid to represent him
is an anomaly and an absurdity." The fullest personal communi-
cation .' Let me give my experience of the fullest personal
communication .'
I once had a client who insisted on interviewing me. At last,
weakly and unprofessionally, I consented. , From that day till
years afterwards I never went into Court but what before long I
was assailed by this hungering litigant. Finally I had to grow a
beard and get rid of him. In another case a man who said he
wanted to see me on private business defeated my clerk and got into
aiy chambers. He was my client—of a guinea brief (only a little
one, I admit, but, though a poor thing, my own). For six hours he
sat and got into legal mare's nests, out of which in turn I had to dis-
lodge him. At last even I—a briefles worm—turned. "Sir,"
I said, drawing myself up to my full height, "Sir, I am obliged
—to your solicitor—for the brief in your case. I am by this time in
perfect possession of the facts. Permit me to remind you that it
is I who am responsible for the late." Then he left. The case
went to the House of Lords, and the junior's brief was marked a
hundred guineas. I was not the junior.
This, Sir, is the result of the "fullest personal communica-
tion." I leave a humane public to decide between Mr. LOCK-
WOOD, ft.C., M.P., and Yours faithfully, L. EBNED COUNSEL.

SHAKE the bottle well!
Even- dose we measure
Makes the bosom swell
With a patient's pleasure.
Joy's electric flame
Ne'er so swiftly passes,
As when through the frame
It shoots from physic-glasses!
Doctors disagree ?—
So the dolts deride us!
Shall ire doubt M.D.

Prove a potent spell,
Smooth away a wrinkle!

With their tasteless doses,
Quenched our physic-thirst,
Made us hold our noses
Over draught and drench,

Rhubarb made us blench,
Jalap was our master.
Now we swig them up!
Pills should have some flavovr.
Brim the "bitter cup"!
Aloes lends it savour,
Vitriol gives it bite,
Brimstone gives it body,
Squills bring appetite,
Laudanum warms like toddy.
And 0 joy! when round

The Blue Pill is found
By the Black Draught lying!

Aiding its detection ;—

LANGUAGE.—1 read in the paper
that " France objects to the prin-
ciple of a Buffer State." Would
somebody kindly explain the
meaning of this curious phrase?
Does it imply that Lord ROSEBEKY
has been calling the French people
buffers? If so, does International
Law allow of such language? A
friend suggested to me that "it
is Siam. and not France, that is
meant." But is it not equally dis-
creditable to use opprobrious ex-
pressions to a weak Oriental
kingdom that cannot retaliate by
a declaration of war? And is
not this a specimen of the way in
which England habitually treats
all feeble races ?—AMATEUR DIP-
LOMAT.
"SMART."
OH! Belles of Bonny Bayswater, pray hearken unto me,
And I '11 show you how to sparkle in Polite Societie.
Never fear that you '11 be visited with contumely or scorn
If you happen not to be aristocratically born;
For success is not dependent on the accident of rank,
And mere birth is badly beaten by a balance at the bank;
So, if only you have money, you need never be afraid
To swagg'er of the swindles of your former days of trade.
For the World, as they receive you to their heart,
Each to each will the opinion impart:
"Oh, she's vulgar, I admit,
/don't like her, not a bit,
But then you know, my dear, she's ' Smart.'"
Your dress must be—well—daring; you must have a tiny waist,
And the colours must be splashed about in execrable taste—
Your bodice may be decent while your youth is in its prime,
But must lower as you counteract the ravages of time.
The colour of your hair and your complexion must appear
To vary with the fashionable fancies of the year;
And, though your wit lack lustre, the tiara must be bright
That you've nired at a jeweller's at ten-and-six a night.
And the World, as they receive you to their heart,
Each to each will the opinion impart:
"Looks quite odd, I must admit,
/ don't like her, not a bit,
But then you know, my dear, she's ' Smart.'"
Then, as to conversation, let each syllable you speak
Be vehemently vapid or extravagantly weak.
Let your words be very risky, though, of course, it must be seen
That you 're artfully pretending that you don't know what they mean.
In the intervals of slander you must prate in flippant tone
On some theologic subject that had best be left alone.
And, though your speech be witless, if not actually absurd,
'Twill be brilliant if a reputation goes at every word.
And the World, as they receive you to their heart,
Each to each will the opinion impart:
"She's ill-natured, I admit,
I don't like her, not a bit,
But then you know, my dear, she's ' Smart.'"
Your parries must be "tidy." So, to compass all your ends.
Find some lady—with a title—who likes living on her friends;
Hint you 're ready with the money that's essential to the task,
If only she will condescend to tell you whom to ask.
On your former friends and neighbours you '11 politely close your door
(Though they used to give you dresses in the days when you werejioor),
Be each guest of yours a Beauty, full of " circumstance and pride,"
A tiara on her head, a co-respondent by her side.
And the World, as they receive you to their heart,
Each to each will the opinion impart:
"She 's a snob, I quite admit,
/don't like her, not a bit,
But then you know, my dear, she's ' Smart.'"
SEASONABLE WISH, FOR A VICTIM OF THE VAMPIRE INSOMNIA.—
I wish you a nappy New Year!

(N.B. No nautical terms or statements guaranteed.)
AWAY by the haunts of the Yang-tse-boo,
Where the Yuletide runs cold gin,
And the rollicking sign of the " Lord Knows Who"
Sees mariners drink like sin;
Where the Jolly ROGER tips his quart
To the luck of the Union Jack;
And some are screwed on the foreign port,
And some on the starboard tack.
Ever they tell the tale anew
Of the chase for the kipperling swag;
How the smack Tommy This and the smack Tommy That
They broached each other like a whiskey-vat,
And the Fuzzy- Wuz took the bag.
Now this is the law of the herring fleet that harries the northern
main,
Tattooed in sears on the chests of the tars with a brand like the
brand of CAIN:
That none may woo the sea-born shrew save such as pay their way
With a kipperling netted at noon of night and cured ere the crack
of day.
It was the woman SAL o' the Dune, and the men were three to one,
SAM the Skipper and NED the Tsipper and BILL that was Son of
a Gun;
SAM was a Skipper and NED wa? a Nipper and BILL was the Son of
a Gun,
And the woman was SAL o' the Dune, as I said, and the men were
three to one.
There was never a light in the sky that night of the soft midsummer
gales,
But the great man-bloaters snorted low, and the young 'uns sang
like whales.
And out laughed SAL (like a dog-toothed wheel was the laugh that
SAL laughed she):
"Now who s for a bride on the shady side of up'ards of forty-
three?"
And NEDDY he swore by butt and bend, and BILLY by bend and bitt.
And nautical names that no man frames but your amateur nautical
wit.
And SAM said, "Shiver my topping-lifts and scuttle my foc's'le yarn.
And may I bo curst, if I'm not in first with a kipperling slued
astarn!"
Now the smack Tommy This and the smack Tommy That and the
Fuzzy- Jf'uz smack, all three,
Their captains bold they were SAM and NED and BILL respectivelec.
And it's writ in the rules that the primary schools of kippers should
get off cheap
For a two mile rea«h off Foulness beach when the July tide's at neap;
And the lawless lubbers that lust for loot and filch the yearling stock
They get smart raps from the coastguard chaps with their blunder-
buss fixed half-cock.
Now SAM the Skipper and NED the Nipper could tell green cheese
from blue,
And SAM knew a trick and NED knew a trick, but BILL knew a
trick worth two.
So SAM he sneaks a corporal's breeks and a belt of pipeclayed hide,
And splices them on to the jibsail-boom like a troopship on the tide.
And likewise NED to his masthead he runs a rag of the Queen's,
With a rusty sword and a moke on board to bray like the Horse
Marines.
But BILL lies low and he keeps off-shore and he waits for things to
stir,
Then he tracks for the deep with a long fog-horn rigged up like a
bowchaser.
Now scarce had NED dropped line and lead when he spots the pipe-
clayed hide,
And the corporal's breeks on the jibsail-boom like a troopship on the
tide;
And SAM likewise, when he ups and spies the slip of a rag of the
Queen's,
And the rusty sword, and he sniffs aboard the moke of the Horse
Marines.
So they each luffed sail, and they each turned tail, and they whipped
their wheels like mad,
When the one he said "By the Lord, it's NED!" and the other,
"It's BILL, by Gad!"
Then about and about, and nozzle to snout, they rammed through
breach and brace,
And the splinters flew as they mostly do when a Government test
takes place.
Then up stole SAM with his little ram and the nautical talk flowed
free,
And in good bold type might have covered the two front sheets of
the P. M. G.
But the fog-horn bluff was safe enough, where all was weed and weft,
And the conger-eels were a-making meals, and the pick of the
flotsam left
Was a binnacle-lid and a leak in the bilge and the chip of a cracked
sheerstrake,
And the corporal's belt and the moke's cool pelt and a portrait of
FRANCIS DRAKE.
So BILL he hauls the dead men's trawls and he booms for the
harbour-bar,
And the splitten fry arejwlted dry by the blink of the morning star.
And SAL o' the Dune was wed next moon by the man that paid
his way
With a kipperling netted at deep of night and cured ere the crack
of day;
For such is the law of the herring fleet that harries the northern
main,
Tattooed in scars on the chests of the tars with a brand like the
brand of CAIN.
And still in the haunts of the Yang-tse-boo
Ever they tell the tale anew
Of the chase for the kipperling swag;
How the smack Tnmmi/ T/iis and the smack Tommy That
They broached each other like a whiskey-vat,
And the Fuzzy- Wuz took the bag.

opinion with their money. The Canal could never have been completed
without the enormous loans to the Company raised by the local Corporations
on the security of the rates."—Daily fitwt.']

In all fair Amphitrite's train than this north-country Thetis.
Eh? "Come unto these yellow sands?" She needs no special pleader,
For on the sea-shore now she stands—through following of her
LEADER!
Has he not led her manfully, through many years, and miles too?
Not unopposed by Fortune's frowns, yet winning her bright smiles,
too!
B v devious ways, through all the maze of Vested Interests guiding h
Like THESEUS through the Labyrinth. When rival nymphs w<

When Parliament seemed dubious, and opponents were abusive,

He bravelv backed, and never slacked until the consummation.

Of the Great Plan that, to a man, now charmetn every voter,

Picklock Holes disguised.
THE ADVENTURES OF PICKLOCK HOLES.
(By Cunnin Toil.)
No. YIII.—PICKLOCK'S DISAPPEARANCE.
NEVER in the course of a long and varied experience have I taken
up my pen with a heavier heart than that which now beats mourn-
fully within niv breast. It has been my enviable lot to follow my
hero, my wonderful friend, my arch-prince of detectives through
many a strange and startling ad-
venture. While he with his match-
less acumen has been engaged in
checking the ambitious designs of
foreign despots, in unveiling to
the startled gaze of statesmen the
criminal plots of secret societies,
in foiling coalitions, in unravelling
the tangled skeins of murder-
conspiracies, in bringing dark
deeds of crime relentlessly home
to ducal perpetrators, in restoring
jewels to bereaved countesses, in
convicting baronets of burglary,
and generally in putting local
constabularies in every part of
the civilised world to shame;
while he, I say, has bfen engaged
in these and similar undertakings
I have been ever at his side, the
faithful foil, the admiring com-
panion, the irremovable fly on the
wheel of his world-renowned ex-
ploits. And now that fate has
taken him from me I scarce know
whither I am to turn. Surely
never again shall I meet in this
world so wise, so cold, so impassive,
so friendly a sleuth-hound of de-
tection; never again shall I behold another upon whom my candid
flow of irrepressible wonder will pour itself with so small an effect.
"POTSON," he would of ten say to me when I had congratulated
him in my impulsive way upon some master-stroke of cunning
strategy; "POISON, you are not absolutely clever, but, personally, i
do not care for very clever men. They are always wanting to
outwit one. The task of course is hopeless, but to counteract it one
has to waste valuable time. But you have about you a comfortable
non-cleverness, always delightfully ready to burst into admiration
whenever I give you an opportunity. POTSON, I like you."
"HOLES, I replied, overcome "by emotion, "you are an extra-
ordinary fellow. I would willingly follow you to the ends of the
world."
I remember this little conversation all the more distinctly because,
taking place as it did in an unfrequented thoroughfare of the
Bloomsbury district, HOLES was immediately afterwards able to
infer from a large stain of milk upon the pavement in front of one of
the houses that a bald and fraudulent solicitor was at that moment
lying in a fit on the floor of the dining-room. This was how he
proved it:
"Milk," he said, "has been spilt here. To spill milk is a blunder
which is often worse than, and, therefore, at least equal to, a crime. We
have therefore got the certainty of a crime. A solicitor has to deal with
crimes. We thus get the fact that we have here a solicitor who has
committed a crime. Now fraud is a crime. Therefore, substituting
fraud for crime we obtain a solicitor who has committed fraud. I
said a moment back that this solicitor was not only fraud but
baldnlent"
"Pardon me," I ventured to interrupt, "pardon me, my dear
HOLES, you mean bald and fraudulent."
"Of course," he retorted, without moving a muscle; "I said so,
bald and fraudulent. Now mark how beautifully it works out. A
detected criminal is invariablv angry. This man has been detected
by me. To be angry is merely another way of saying that one has
lost his hair. He is, therefore, proved beyond possibility of doubt to
be bald. With regard to the fit, the process of induction is no less
delicate and convincing. A solicitor wears clothes which tit him,
whether well or badly matters not. He has, therefore, a fit. Have
I proved mv case!'"
"HOLM,'' I said "you are a wonderful fellow."
We informed the neighbouring policeman, but 1 cannot now
remember if matters proceeded to a conviction. The incident, how-
ever, remains in my mind as one of the most remarkable proofs of my
friend's almost superhuman powers.
And now, as I said, I have lost him, and must proceed as best 1
can to give some account of his disappearance. We were engaged in
investigating the mysterious circumstances connected with the theft
of one of our best-known public monuments. I do not care to be
more precise, though some day in defence of my friend I may have to
tell the story in detail. But at present the honour of a great family
is involved, and I prefer to mention no names. I had noticed that
HOLES had been even more taciturn than was usual with him during
the course of his investigations, but at the time I attributed little
importance to this. One night ne came quietly into my rooms, and
after removing from my coat a speck of dust, wnich proved, he said,
that I had been assaulted by a ticket-of-leave man m Southampton
Street at 5.45 that very afternoon, he sat down opposite me in an
armchair. "POTSON," he said, "there is something in this business
which is out of the common. At every turn I encounter a hidden
force. I walk in Piccadilly and am splashed with mud by a passing
hansom; I turn into Regent Street, and a Music Hall singer—I knew
him by his prosperous, well-fed appearance—insists on shaking
hands with me. Discouraged by these accidents I stroll into Jermyn
Street, when a regiment of Life-Guards charging up Bury Street all
but tramples mo under foot. There is more in all this than meets
the eye. POTSON, I am being pursued."
"But surely," I said, "they know you too well. .Who would
venture to pursue you? Would anyone venture to fly in the face of
the public and of probability by tracking one who has always been
himself the tracker?"
But my words were unavailing. He insisted upon it that he was
being shadowed, and left me with this
impressive warning: "If I do not return
to you to-morrow before six o'clock you -
will know that I am somewhere else. Do
not look for me in the Serpentine."
On the following day I awaited the
arrival of six o'clock with a feverish
impatience. As the hour struck the door
did not open, but a scrap of torn paper
came fluttering down from the ceiling.
I grasped it convulsively, and read these
words:
"MY DEAR POTSON,—It has been a duel
to the death, and both of us perished.
By the kindness of my late opponent,
MY. SHERLOCK HOLMES, I have been per-
mitted to expire after him, and to use
the few remaining seconds of life that
remain in me in writing to you. I knew
I was pursued, • and- I knew it was
SHERLOCK who was dragging me to my
doom. I have killed him, but at the
penalty of my own life. If you wish to
know more do as I should have done
under the circumstances. Commend me
to Mrs. POTSON, and believe me yours
inductively, "PICKLOCK HOLES."
That was all. The blow was a terrible
one, but when I recovered in a measure
I set to work immediately to do what I
thought HOLES would have done. I
assumed a meditative air, I conducted
chemical experiments, I despised the
police, I picked up clues m unsus-
pected corners, I proved beggars in rags (j,e9pot "picklock H "lets

all my enorts were fruitless. My mend, s
last behest is to me a sacred command. Some other—not I—may
search the depths of the Serpentine and discover there the secret
which I have sought in vain.*

I
SCENE—The Stalls of Drury Lane. TIME—During the Historical
Pageant. Uncle, tcho t other prides himself upon his knowledge
of" the Nation's Story," is acting as Lecturer to two rather
np-to-date young Indies.
Uncle (at end of career of " Robinson Crusoe"). And now, my 1
dears, you are going to learn all about English History in Twenty
Minutes. (Referring to action on the stage.) You see, there are the
, Ancient Britons, and here they are opposing the Normans.
First Niece. Yes, Uncle; but didn't the Ancient Britons oppose
the Romans?
Uncle. Yes, as well. And you see there's WILLIAM THE CON-
QUEROR, and he stops and picks up an oyster, and shows it to his
followers in triumph. You Imow they came to England chiefly on
account of its oysters.
Second Niece. Are you not thinking of JULIUS C.ESAR, Uncle?
Uncle. Well, the oysters at Colchester and Hastings had both a
reputation for centuries. And there you see, there's HENRY THE
FIRST and his books—he was a very fine scholar, you know; but he
wasn't very truthful. Very clever indeed! Telling a falsehood at
the dinner-table, and dying. Capitally done! Don t you know that
was why the sea encroached upon the land oif Herne Bay?
First Niece. I thought that was Earl GODWIN, Uncle?
Uncle. Yes, very likely. But to the best of mj- belief it occurred
to HENRT THE JIRST too. And see, here's Sing JOHN signing
Magna Charta. Very good indeed! Ah, we owe all our liberties to
that!
Second Niece. I forget what were the provisions of Magna Charta,
Uncle; will you tell them to me?
Uncle. Oh, to allow people to make wills and to have a right of
way across fields and all that sort of thing. Most excellent pro-
visions. And see here, RICHARD is about to hang the burgesses of
Calais when his Queen intercedes for them and he lets them off.
Really first-rate!
first Niece. But wasn't it EDWARD THE FIRST who spared the
burgesses? And look, he has found a garter! Surely that was
EDWARD, wasn't it, Uncle?
Uncle. Yes, my dear, one of the EDWARDS; but I am always
rather confused between the EDWARDS and
the HENRYS. Ah, here we have the crusades!
You see those must be the Saracens. And
there's the English King with his banner.
He has been taken prisoner.
Second Niece. But why has he got Bannock-
burn on it, Uncle? Mustn't he be the BRUCE?
Uncle. Ah, of course! It is ROBERT BRUCE
in Palestine. Quite right! And look here.
EDWARD presenting the first PRITTCE OF
WALES to the Welsh. Very clever indeed.
First Niece.. Which EDWARD was that,
Uncle?
Uncle. The second, of course. He after-
wards became EDWARD the Black Prince and
EDWARD THE THIED.
Second Niece. Then is that him quieting
the mob and killing WAT TYLER? I thought
that was RICHARD THE SECOND.
Uncle. Yes; I believe you are right. And
see, here is HENRY THE THIRD, pleased with
his son yielding to the Chief Justice. You
see he has discarded Sir JOHN FALSTAFFon
becoming HENRY THE FOURTH, and he has
won in consequence Agincourt. Don't you
see it on the banner?
First Niece. But didn't HENRY THE FIFTH
win Agincourt, Uncle?
Uncle. According to some historians,
perhaps; but there is so much dispute about
these matters nowadays. And look, here is
the origin of the Wars of the Roses. You
see, some of them took white and some red.
The roses were brought in a basket like
that.
Second Niece. But surely those are tennis
balls. What had they to do with the battles
,(f the Roses?
Uncle. Why, they were playing with them
in the- Temple Gardens. Haven t you seen
them playing lawn-tennis there to this day?
It is perfectly extraordinary how these old
customs are continued. _And see, here's
HENRY THE EIGHTH, and all his wives!
Very good indeed! And that's Queen MARY
ordering MARY, Queen of Scots, to be exe-
"" cuted on the day of her wedding.
First Niece. Wasn't it Queen ELIZABETH, Uncle, who ordered
MARY, Queen of Scots, to be executed?
Uncle. She was the actual cause of the death of MARY, Queen of
Scots, certainly. But Queen MARY, too, was greatlv opposed to her.
And see here is Queen ELIZABETH and Sir WALTER RALEIGH and the
Spanish Ambassador in black velvet. You see he presents her with
a letter asking her to be the wife of PHILIP, and she gives it him
back. First rate! That was the cause you know of the Spanish
Armada.
Second Niece. But why is she so civil to the Ambassador after-
wards. She's leaning on his arm. And why is he so pensive and
always in an attitude.
Uncle. Oh, ELIZABETH had wonderful tact, you know. She was
all things to all men.
First Niece. Don't you think, Uncle, that the pensive gentleman
in black velvet may be meant for SHAKSPEARE?
Uncle. I fancy not. And see, here's CROMWELL and MARLBOROUGII
introducing WILLIAM and MARY and CHARLES THE SECOND with his
beauties.
Second Niece. Surely WILLIAM and MART were later than the
Stuarts?
Uncle. They were all about the same period. You remember,
there was the Old and the Young Pretender. But here we are in our
own times. Splendid! See here 'u the Hall of History and there's
the QUEEN! Capital! And here are the events of her present
Majesty's reign. You see there 'a NAPOLEON, NELSON, and WELLING-
TON. And here comes WILLIAM THE FOURTH.
First Niece. But surely WILLIAM THE FOURTH wasn't?
Uncle. Oh, it's all right, but I think, dears, we had better be
quiet, now, as we seem to be disturbing other people.

WHAT I hate at big hotels i#the constant entrance
of page-boys calling the nuinbers-of rooms, for the
occupants of which there are visitors, telegrams, or
messages. The other day, in the writing-room of
the Grandest Hotel, I began a letter, "Dearest
SOPHO.VISBA." Funny name, BoFHOVIHU. But she
is a very serious girl, and refuses to be called by
absurd nicknames. 'Dearest SOPHOXISBA, I have
not written to you since this morning. What a long
time it is since we parted! When I am away from
you the hours in every day seem to be—

up. It was a page. I murmured " No."

—at 12.63"—I wrote what was just then in
my thoughts, as one often does—•" at 12.15, and in

by any penmanship, and nobody begins " together"

afresh, hating alterations at important points. For
a few minutes I was undisturbed, and I had reached
"Ever your most devoted ALGERNON," when I
remembered that I had not referred at all to the
illness of her favourite brother, a horrid boy, whom
I pretended to like. As I wrote the postscript another
page rushed in.
"354," he called loudly, looking at me as though
I were a crowd, perhaps including the' occupant of
No. 354. When I raised m^- "hand, implying-by the
movement "Go away," the boy evidently thought

muttered some angry words, hastily folded up the
letter, and posted it.
When I went to see SOPHOXISBA on Friday, she
received me coldly, and called me " Mr. GOSLING."
I begged for some explanation, and she showed me
the postscript of my letter. "I am sorry to hear
that TOMMY has the measles. Hang the boy!"
She has refused to see me since then.

emblazoned and set as a standard in their midst,
bearing the legend, "There is luck in odd numbers."
But, by the way. to accept this is, so to speak, to

DISILLUSION.
(By a Middle-ay'td Man.)
WHEN I was young, my schemes were vast;
I dreamt by day, not after supper.
I wrote—all bards should be surpassed,
From SHAKSPEAEE down to MARTIN

I drew—dark REMBRANDT, RAPHAEL,
Rich RUBENS, REYNOLDS, I 'd resemble.
I played—resolving to excel
Such men as GARHICK, KEAX, and KEMBLE.
I loved—gay maidens I would meet,
With them midst verdant meads meander,
Or risk my life to kiss mv sweet,
A nineteenth century Leander.
I write—a lawyer's deeds and bills,
Dull, tiresome work that never ceases;
I draw—conveyances and wills,
Agreements, mortgages, and leases.
I play—this very humble part,
I cannot hope for any other;
I love—my wife, she's plain, not smart;
I only wish she had no mother.

THEY were all de-
ighted. They congra-
tulated one another, and
shook hands all round.
Never was seen such en-
thusiasm since the days
when the late CHARLES
DICKENS wrote his
Christmas stories. Men
whe had been silent for
months suddenly be-
came loquacious, and
the most taciturn of
spinsters found that
they had plenty to say.
A spell seemed to have
been removed. England
was herself again.
"During the sum-
mer," observed the first
of the guests, "the
topic was absolutely im-
possible. Nothing but
sunshine and blue sky.
Not an hour of rain for
weeks and months."
"Quite so. If we had
lived at the Equator the
time could not have
been more monotonous.
Oh, it was too dread-
ful!" cried a second.
"Yes, I dp not re-
member the like in my
time." put in a third.
"Why, everyone had
become as mute as an
ovster. However, it is
all over now. Do you
think it will ram to-dav
or do you think it will
snow?"
"Well, I don't know,
but the glass was fall-
ing and I fear the
worst,"
And then they con-
tinued the discussion
with the greatest plea-
sure. For England had
ence more become
"Merrie England."
And the reason f Why,
this. After a long

once again able to talk

A NEW-YEAR'S GIFT.
WHAT's this? "By Parcel Post," I see,
Perhaps a friendly gift for me,
A token pleasant
Of some companionship sincere—
Nay, best of all—the writing's clear,
This happy day has brought me here
Sweet MABEL'S present!
A pipe! And such a ... perfect gem.
That slim, impracticable stem,
What man could plan it?
And then, as I 'm a living soul,
Just feel this wondrous " meerschaum" bowl,
Which fittingly completes the whole—
As hard as granite!
Yet, given by her dainty hand,
What prince or noble in the land
Would dare refuse it?
This present which she's kindly bought
I '11 prize sincerely, as I ought,
Keep, l.ve—do anything, in short,
. Save only—use it!

One who in epigram impromptu glories.
And—above all things f—who can 'tell good

AIR—" Ben Block."
WOULD you hear a sad story of
woe,
That tears from a stone might
provoke?
'Tis concerning a tar, you must
know,
To whom danger and death
were a joke.
His name was BEX BLOCK, of all
men
The most true, the most kind,
the most brave;
But hard-treated by fortune—
for BEX,
In his prime, found a watery
grave.
It was not upon the high seas,
A-fighting the storm or the
foe;
No! 'twas not midst dangers
like these
He gloriously ended—ah, no!
A land-fog confounded BEX
BLOCK;
There was no hand to help or
to save.
When poor BEX staggered into
the dock,
And plunged deep in a watery
grave!

\
SO VERY NATURAL.
Hanker. "I WISH YOU A HAPPY AND PROSPEROUS NEW YEAR."
Smart Broker. "THANKS, THAT DEPENDS ENTIRELY ox you, SIR."
A plague on all miserly knaves.
Who neglect their dashed
docks to protect,
A death midst the sea's briny
waves
Is what a brave tar may ex-
pect;
But to drown like a fly in stale
beer,
Because skinflints their cop-
pers would save,
No rope, buoy, or life-saver'near,
Is a sad sort o' watery grave.
It is time that each miserly elf
Should be taught that that
death-trap his dock
Must not, just to pile up his
pelf,
Drown dozens of tars like BEX
BLOCK.
Such murder must go on no
more;
Some means must be hit on
to save
Our fog-muddled sailors ashore
From a dark, dirty watery
grave!

A LITTLE GIBRALTERATION.
SIB,—This plan of neutralising the Mediterranean is really admir-
able. Let's do it at once! When I say at once, of course I mean
as soon as the Government has settled Home Rule all round, Eight
Hours, Parish Councils, and the rest of the domestic programme.
Then we can sell a lot of our ships, and cut down the Naval Budget
by one-half, and, with the money so obtained, give all the unem-
ployed pensions of five shilling a day, together with free dinners,
beer, tobacco, and room-rent, for the rest of their lives. The only
"Balance of Power" worth having is the balance at our bankers!
That's the creed of Yours, unblushingly, COSMOPOLITE.
ESTEEMED EDITOR,—Glad to find dear Old England is talking
of neutralising Mediterranean. Always thought it was her best
policy. Think so much more now, since Toulon fetes. Give up
Gibraltar to Spain, and there you at once have the immense naval
resources of Spain added to your own in case of war. Malta of
course will go to France, Cyprus and Egypt to Russia, and you '11
find the Cape route to India far pleasanter in every way after
you 've once got accustomed to it. Such a saving, too, not to have
to keep up your expensive Mediterranean squadron!
1 ours, disinterestedly, ALEXIS SLYKOFF.
SIB,—Let's neutralise everything! So much safer. Or neutralise,
let's say. Dover and Portsmouth. Then, in case of war, no enemv
can touch them. The same with I/ondon and Paris, Berlin and
Constantinople. I know, from an intimate friend of the late Lord
TEXKYSON, that the line he really wrote was "The Parliament of
Man, the Neutralisation of the World," only somv printer's devil
altered it to "Federation," and the P. L. never noticed the error!
Then, if the principle were once adopted, we could go on to neutralise
the property of all millionaires; that would render it available for
the use of the public, and of
Yours, cheerily, IMPEHIAL-SOCIAL-DEMOCBAT.
A CHEERFUL COMPANION.—Mr. GEORGE GROSSMITH, now starting
on his American tour, will, it is stated, "accompany himself"
wherever he goes.
PLANTERS AND THEIR "PLANTS."
[See indignant letters in the Standard on the premiums demanded from
"creepers" oil tea-plantations in Ceylon and farmpupils in Canada and
Australia.]
START ix LIFE !—A Ceylon Tea-Planter has vacancies for half-a-
dozen young men on his small and miserably-unhealthy estate in the
interior, which, except for the exorbitant premiums which he asks
with each pupil, would probably go into the Bankruptcy Court
to-morrow. They will gain practical experience of the minutirc of
tea-growing, cholera, and jungle-fever. A year spent in this way
may lead to a fortune; it may also lead to the local cemetery. A
good place for a medical student wanting to study bacilli, or for a
coroner in search of active occupation. Delicate English youths
come here, and leave in an incredibly short space of time with a
wonderful knowledge of tea and no liver whatever. This is a chance
which may never occur again.
WHAT TO DO WITH Otis BOYS.—Ship them to Quebec, en route
for the boundless North-West. Invigorating climate. Thermometer
rarely descends more than fifty degrees below zero. Not more than
six blizzards a week. Premium required, only £200, for the privi-
lege of working like a navvy for a couple of years without any pay.
Just the sort of employment to take the nonsense out of youths found
unmanageable at home. Practical farmer has first-rate opening for
such. Opening should be closed with. The experience acquired is
sure to be profitable—to practical farmer, if not to his pupils.
WANTED.—Any number of "Creepers," with thoroughly stupid
and gullible parents, for a coffee-plantation near Colombo. Glorious
place for sport. Tigers and cobras found on the estate. Good bags
< of elephants can be made. Adjoining forests teeming with deer and
malana. As the day's work, of superintending sickly and dissatis-
| tied coolies, only begins at four in the morning, and rarely lasts
beyond six at night, there is obviously plenty of time to spare for
hunting expeditions. Capital spot for lovers of natural history who
I do not object to sunstrokes. Apply at once.'
GENUINE (PARLIAMENTARY) HOSPITALITY.—Keeping open Honse
during the Christmas Holidays.

CERTAINLY CHARLES WYJJDHAM'H impersonation of The Headless

who is the antithesis of Hedlei/, being the sole representative of

law and order in the house of Hedley, Spooner, ami Meamrell; then
comes the old claimant to a peerage, perfectly played by Mr. J. G.
TAYLOR; and, finally, Mr. BLAKELEY'S quaint General Bletchingly,
perpetually being bullied and put through his facings by Mrs.
General (Miss F. FRANCES). The " three men scene," where in the
Third Act Hedley tries to arrange matters between the claimant and
the sorrowing General, is so well played that it elicits a round of
applause at its conclusion—a rare tribute which may remind play-
goers of the-reception accorded to the serious "three-men scene"
in Diplomacy. Miss JEFFREYS is a charming Mrs. Turrington.
Weather permitting,—for wintry snows play the mischief with
"runs" of pieces as well as with runs with hounds,—the piece ought
to be in the bill for some time to come.
MIXED NOTIONS.
OUR NAVAL SUPREMACY.
SCENE—A frst-class compartment in a suburban morning train to
London. PERSONS—Two Well-informed Men, cm Inquirer,
and an Average Man.
First Well-informed Man (concluding a tirade). What '11 be the
result? Why, we shall be jolly well swept off the sea, that's what
we shall be. \Ve 're only just ahead of Russia and France now, and
in another year or two we shall be nowhere compared to them.
There's no getting out of it. You 've only got to look through the
last list of their ships
Second Well-informed Man (interrupting). Ah! but does that
list include corvettes?
Inquirer. What's a corvette?
Second W. I. M. (with surprise). You don't mean to say you don't
know what a corvette is?
Inq. No, I don't, honestly. What is it?
Second W. I. M. (cornered). It's a ship they use for taking
messages quickly. It's very heavily armoured.
Inq. Ah! Then are we stronger in corvettes than the other
Johnnies?
Second W. I. M. (shortly). Of course we are—ever so much
stronger.
First W. I. M. (u-ilh deliberation). Now, look here, this isn't a
party question. It's far above party. But I should really like to
know what the Government mean to do, because if they don't look j
sharp and do something, we may as well all pack up our traps and!
emigrate to America. We can't sit still and do nothing with Russia
and France in the Mediterranean, can we?
Inq. Is Russia in the Mediterranean? I had a sort of idea it
was somewhere further north than that?
First W. I. M. My dear chap, that's what all the row's about.
Russia has made up her mind she's going to have her fleets in the
Mediterranean, and we all know that when she's made up her mind
about anything she generally manages to do it. Why, she can build
hundreds of ships in the Black Sea, or the Baltic, or the Caspian,
without anyone Tcnowing anything about it, and then all she "sj?ot
to do is just to nh) into the Mediterranean, and there she is. What
I say is that the Government ought immediately to build, say, twenty
more ironclads and another fifty torpedo-boats, and a few corvettes
and cruisers, and send them out all over the place before the end of
the year. That would teach these other chaps a lesson.
Arerage Man. Yes, I daresay it would. We generally do teach
the other chaps all we know, free, gratis and for nothing. But to
hear you talk, one might suppose you imagined we could build an
ironclad or so every week. I fancy vou '11 find it takes longer than
that. Besides, where's this sort of thing to stop? Twenty iron-
clads means, I suppose, something over ten millions. You 're always
laughing at foreign nations for what you call their ridiculous rivalry
in armies, and thanking Heaven we're a free country and can rely on
volunteers and all that; and then you want to start on an immense
race for navies, without a thought of the cost. Why you'll be the
first to grumble when the bill comes in.
First W. I. M. That's all very well. You talk as if we'd got
the millennium all ready to be turned on at a moment's notice; but
you know as well as I do that we 're not living in Olympia
Arer. M. (cruelly). No, nor in Utopia either—which was what
you meant, I suppose.
first W. I. M. Well, call it Utopia if you like. You know what
I mean-anyhow.
Inq. Where's Utopia? I mean, who docs really live there?
First W. I. M. On, it's a sort of classical place.
Inq. Ah! [A pause. They read their tieiritpapfri.
First W. I. M. (suddenly and triumphantly). Aha! Didn't I
tell you? Just listen to this. (He reads.) "\Vhen France and
Russia have finished their present programme of ship-building they
will be superior to us both in numbers and in tonnage. With their fast
cruisers they mil be able to prey upon our commerce, while their
heavy ships will be able to block our fleet in its ports. If we do
venture, out, Jhe first general engagement will prove to the hilt the
soundness of all that I nave ever said in these columns and elsewhere
about the fatal inferiority not only of our present type of armoured
ships, but also of the guns they carry. The sun of England will set
beneath the waves strewn with the shattered remains of the costly
gewgaws on which our money has been wasted. Russia will annex
India, France will seize the" Channel Islands, Spain will re-conquer
Gibraltar, and a dishonoured flag will float over an empire from
which trade and prosperity will have vanished for ever. An indignant
country will then demand a heavy reckoning from the Admiralty, but
it will be too late. An obstinate neglect of the warnings of experience
will have done its work onlv too effectually. I remain, Sir, yours.
JOHN F. BONSOK, Rear-Admiral." What have you got to say to that r
Second W. I. M. Who's old BONSOH? Everything he says isn't
gospel, is it?
firtt W. I. M. He's an Admiral, anyhow, and I suppose he
ought to know better than civilians.
Second W. I. M. (sarcastically). Oh, he couldn't know better
than some civilians who know everything.
first. Jfr. I. M. Come now, I'lljmt a plain question to yon. Is
this blessed Government of yours going to build a proper amount of
ships, or is it not?
Second W. I. M. This blessed Government of mine, as you call it,
is going to dp what your blessed Government never could do, and
that is to build ships that will float right side upwards.
first W. I. M. Ha, ha! very funny. That's quite your record
joke, that is. But if they 're going to do it why don't they tell us so?
Second W. I. M. They have.
first W. I. M. They haven't.
7«7. But what's all this about the Mediterranean? Haven't we
got any ships anywhere else?
First If. I. M. Everybody knows that the Mediterranean's the
only important sea nowadays. (Boldly.) Why, India depends upon
the Mediterran -..n.
Inq. Does it really? How's uatr
First W. I. M. If we lost the Mediterranean, how do you suppose
we should ever get round the Cape, eh?
Inq. Of course; I never thought of that. That would be rather
awkward. But does the Mediterranean belong to us now?
First W. I. M. Yes, most of it does.
Second W. I. M. It doesn't.
First W. I. M. Well, to whom does it belong, then?

p 1 o y m e n t.
What does it all
mean?
First Well-
informed Man
(quoting glibly).
My dear chap, the whole question centres rouud one point, and that is
whether great employers of labour, like the London and North-
Western Railway Company, are to be allowed to continue their acci-
dent insurance funds or not. There ought to be no doubt as to the
answer when we know that the workmen themselves are in favour of
these funds. Yet the Government says the funds are to be abolished!
Ing. Well, that does seem wrong, of course.
Second Well-informed Man. Steady a bit, my friend; don't you
be in such a hurry. The Government says nothing of the kind.
(Quoting with equal glibness.) What the Government does say is
that the insurance funds may continue, but that no workman shall
be deprived of his legal remedy, and that even-thing must be done
to diminish the number of accidents. But (bitterly) of course that's
what JOE CJT.IMDEHLAIN and the rest of them won't have at any
price.
Inq. Ah, they 're wrong there, of course.
First W. I. M. That's right. Put everything down to the
Opposition. But I tell you that in this matter the House of Lords
are the real guardians of our liberties.
Inq. What have they done?
First W. I. M. AVhy, they've inserted an amendment allowing
contracting out.
Inq. But what is contracting out?
First W. I. M. (gaining time). I suppose you know that these
great works are mostly done by contract?
Inq. (dubiously). Yes.
First W. I. M. Well, that'sit.
Second W. I. M. No, it isn't. Contracting out is when the
employer gets hold of the workman's money by telling him he's
going to look after him, and then in the end [vaguely]—well, he
doesn't look after him as he promised.
Inq. (hopeleulff. to Average Man). Is that it?
Arerage Man. It's what I should call rather a loose definition. I
had a sort of notion it meant an agreement between employer and
employed that the provisions of the Act should not apply to them.
linth the W. I. M. (together). Nonsense, it can't mean that.
Arer. M. Whv not?
First W. I. Jl/. How can anybody say an Act of Parliament
shan't apply to him? What's the use of passing an Act of Parlia-
ment at all then?
Arer. M. Just so; but I shouldn't have expected you of all
people in the world to use that argument. [A pause.
Inq. (returning to the charge). But how about common employ-
ment, you know. They call it a doctrine, or something of that kind.
I thought that meant a religion. How does that come in here?
Second W. I. M. (hazarding a nolle conjecture). That's just the
ridiculous part of it; it all comes of having the Bishops in the House
of liOrds. What I say is, religion and politics ought to be kept abso-
lutely separate. Besides, I 'm against the House of Lords anyhow.
First W. I. M. There you go again. Everything'a the fault of
the House of Lords with you. You 're just like that old josser who
couldn't keep King Somebody's head out of his speeches. Same with
you: whenever you can't get everything you want all at one go,
smack you go against the House of Lords. What have they done to
you now?
Inq. (trimming). Yes, what hare they done? I wish you 'd tell
me.
Second W. I. M. (pulling himself resolutely together, and quoting
again). What have they done? I like your asking that question.
Why. in the first place, they 've emasculated the Bill with their con-
founded amendments which nobody wants
VOL. en.
First W. I. M. (interrupting). I be£ jour pardon. Everybody
wants them. All the workmen whose opinion is worth anything have
declared that they must have these amendments; otherwise^the Bill
will ruin them.
Second If. I. M. (irajring irarm). Oh, I say, tell that to the
marines. How on earth is a Bill like this going to ruin the workmen?
Inq. (feeling his ground again slipping from under him). Yes,
I don't quite see myself how it's going to do that.
First W. I. M. Don't von? Of course, I can't make you see it if
you don't want to. But 1 should have thought anyone with half an
eye could sec that the Bill without those amendments must ruin the
working-classes, because it'll smash all their insurance funds.
Who do you think is going to give 'em any more money when the
Bill passes, unless these amendments go in?
Inq. But what are the amendments?
First W. I. M. They simply lay down the principle that these
insurance funds are not to be abolished because the Trades Unions
say so.
Second W. I. M. Then do you mean soberly to tell me that you
wish to deprive workmen of their legal right to compensation if tney
get choked in a mine or cut to bits in a railway accident? Because
that's what your argument means, if it means anything.
First W. I. M. (sneering). A jolly lot of good compensation will
do 'em when they 've been cut to bits. I suppose you 11 want to lay
it down that they're to have money in proportion to the number of
bits they get chopped into.
Second W. I. M. That was worthy of a follower of I/ord
SALISBURY'S.
First W. I. M. What do you mean?
Second W. I. M. (fully roused). I mean this; that you and Lord
SALISBURY never lose a chance of sneering at the working-classes
and their accidents. Why not try a change and give them what
they want?
First W. I. M. Well, anyhow, they don't want this precious
Liability BUI.
Second W. I. M. I say they do.
First, W. I. M. And I say they don't.

BETWEEN THE PIECES AT THE LYCEUM.
DURING the absence of Mr. HENRY IRVING in America Mr.
OSCAK BARKETT is in command at the Lyceum. The new manager
seems to be following in the footsteps ot the old. As there were
clowns in the Shakspearian pieces, so there is a clown in Cinderella,
the play that has taken the place of liecketj presumably with a view
to keeping the boards warm until the promised revival of Faust and
Marguerite. The Wellington Street pantomime would have pleased
Polonius, Lord Chamberlain to His Majesty Claudius, King
of Denmark, inasmuch as "there is no offence in it." On the
contrary, it is a meritorious production. Some of the scenery
and much of the dancing is worthy of the highest praise, and if
the fun of the book is not always fast and furious, it is quite in
harmony with the traditions of the house. In the home of the
legitimate drama we are accustomed to smile with becoming mirth.
Comparisons are odious, so itisunnecessarytoeompareMiss Cinderella
of \\ ellington Street with Master Robinson Crusoe of the second turn-
ing to the right. And this is the more satisfactory, as there is no
comparison between them. All the world knows that Drurv Lane is
good, and everyone is pleased to hear that DHURIOLANUS is better.

Mention some of the topics referred to by PEEICLES in his speech as

The Examiner (sarcastically). I am glad to see you are acquainted
with that fact, at any rate, Mr. SINEWS. Now will you take that
copy of Lrvr in your hand, and translate the passage marked in it.
(loung THEWSAND SINEWS, after great difficulty, manages to give a
bald and ungrammatical version of what he thinks the meaning to
be. An ominous silence follows on the part of the Examiner, who
at length says:) There is a copy of XENOPHON'S Anabasis close to
your elbow; just translate the few lines at the top of page 79. (Young
THEWSAND SINEWS makes a gallant effort to do so, but sticks hope-

A DIALOGUE ON ART.
(A Study in Spirits and ffraler.)
SCENE— The Smoke-room of a Provincial Hotel. TIME— Towards
midnight. CHARACTERS—Mr. LUCESLIPP-BLETIIERON, a middle-
aged Art Patron and Dilettante. He has arrirrd at his third
tumbler of whiskey and tcater, and the stage at which a man
alludes freely before strangers to his "poor dear father." Mr.
MILBOAKD, a Painter, on a sketching tour. He is enduring Mr.
L.-B. with a patience which trill last fur just one more pipe.
First Commercial, who considers Mr. L.-B. a highlit agreeable
and well-informed gentleman, and is anxious to be included in
his audience. Second Commercial, who doesn't intend to join in
the conversation until he feels he can do so with crushing effect.
Mr. Luceslipp-Bletheron. Yes, I assure you, I never come acrosh
a DAVID Cox but I say to myself, "There'sh a Bit!" (Here he fixes
to him, " How mush?" an' he tol1 me, and there wash an end of it,
do you shee?
Mr, Milb. It's the ordinary course of business, isn't it?
Mr. L.-li. Egshackly. But how few do it! Now, I '11 tell you
'nother shtory 'bout my"poo' dear father. He came 'pon a sculpture
in a curioshity shop; it wash very dirty and used up, but my dear
father saw it was worth shpotting, and a thing to be shpotted, and sho
he put hish finger on it!
First Coinm. (undaunted by past failure). And was it an antique,
Sir?
Mr. L.-B. That 'sh more 'n I can tell you; it wash very dirty, at
any rate, and he only gave fifty guincash for it. Washn't a great
shum .
First Cumin, (encouraged by this affability). Xo, indeed; a mere
nothing, so to speak, Sir 1
Mr. L.-B. (annoyed}. Will you have the goodnesh to lemme finish
what I was telling thish gentleman? When mv poo' father got that
his eye-glass, sips whiskey and water, and looks at Mr. MILBOARD as busht home, it was the mos' perfect likenesh p' NAPOLEON!

CORNELIUS JAXSSEN at home. Itsh only hishtory is—my dear father; it, and found a genuine Morland; went on cleaning, and discovered
f of penetration.
Now, we've a'
bought it. He was an artist himself, painted a bit, travelled man, ' an undoubted Rembrandt
an' all that short o' thing.
Well, he picked it up for
ten pounds!
First Commercial (defer-
entially). Did he reelly
now? A Johnson for ten
pounds! Did he get a war-
ranty with it, Sir?
Mr. L.-B. (after bringing
the eye-glass to bear on the
intruder for a second). Then
I've a Mieris — at leasht,
shome clever f ler painted
it, and it 'sh a pleashure to
look at it, and you can't get
1 over that, can you?
Mr. Milboard. I don't
intend to try to get over it.
Mr. L.-B. lou're qui'
right. Now I 'm the lasht
man in the world to shwag-
ger; shtill, I'm goin' to
ashk you to lemme have my
HI' shwagger now. I hap-
pened to be at Rome shor"
time ago, and I metMiDDLE-
MAN there. We had our

friend o' mine. Well; I
picked up a HI' drawing by
a Roman chap; worth no-
thing more than what I got
it for, or anything, as you
may shay. MIDDLEMAN had
the whole run of this chap's

—didn't care mush about
it—but thought it wash a
gem, and gave the modesh

Mr. L.-B. Xo man with the shlightest feelin' or reverence for Art

Xow I 'm comiu' to my point. One afternoon after my return, I
wash walking down Bond Street, when I saw a sketch exhibited in a
window by the shame f ler. I went in and shaid, " What are you
asking for thish? Mind, I don' wanter buy it; ashk me any price
you like!'' And they shaid forty guineash.
Mr._ Milb. Apparently they availed themselves of your permission,
and did ask you any price they liked.
Mr. L.-B. No doubt; but wait till I 've done. I saw another—a

a man Hke MIDDLEMAN, being there, and having the pick, shouldn
buy more of 'em!
Mr. Milb. Wasn't worth his while; he can't buy everything .'
Mr. L.-B. (after considering this impartially with some more
whiskey). No; your ansher is a very good one, and a verv/«i> one.
He can't buy everything. I did pick, however, an' I gorrit. I said
cleaned that, and came to a CrivelH;
couldn't stop, kept on clean-
ing, and was rewarded by a
a portrait of GEORGE THE
FOURTH!
First Comm. (deeply im-
pressed). And all of them
genuine? How rtry extra-
ordinary, to be sure!
Mr. L.-B. (wagging his
head sapiently). I could tell
you shtranger things than
that. But as I was shaving,
here was this busht of NA-
POLEON, by some French
chap—which you would tell
me was against it.
Mr. Milb. Why? The
French are the best sculptors
in the world.
Mr. L.-B. The Frensh!
I can not bring myshelf to
believe that, if only for
thish shimple reashon, they
haven't the patiensh for it!
First Comm. So / should
have said. For my own part
—not knowing much about
it, very likely — I should
have put the Italians first.
Mr. Milb. If you are
talking of all time
First Comm. (feeling at
last at his ease). I should
say, even now. Why, there
was a piece of statuary in
the Italian Exhibition at
Earl's Court some vears
back that took my fancy
and took my wife's fancy
verj much. It was a repre-
sentation in marble of a 'en and chickens, all so natural, and with
every individual feather on the birds done to such a nicety——!
Mr. Milb. I was hardly referring to the skill with which the
Italians carve—ah—poultry.
Mr. L.-B. Ridic'lous! Great mishtake to talk without unncr-
shtanding shubject, (The First Commercial retires from the room
in disorder.) One thing I should like to ashk is thish. Why are
sculptors at present day sho inferior to the antique? Ishn't the
human form divine ash noble and ash shymmetrical ash formerly';
Why can't they reproduce it then?
Mr. Milb. Vou must first find your sculptor. Providence doesn't
see fit to create a MICHAEL ANGELO or a PRAXITELES every five
minutes, any more than a SHAKSPEAKE.
Mr. L.-B. (wavering between piety and epigram). Thank the
Lord for that.' Now there'sh Floreush. Shomc of us who have had
the run there—well, there you see all the original thingsh—all the
originalsh. And yet, if you'll believe me (dreamily), with all my
love and charm for Art, gimme the Capitolme Yenusli living and
breathing \njiesh and blood, Sir, not in cold lifelesh marble!
Mr. Milb. That of course is a matter of taste. But we are talking
about Art, not women.
Mr. L.-B. (profoundly). Unforsh'nately, women are the shubjects
of Art. You 've got to rind out your client's shtyleof Art tirsht, and
then carry it out in the besht possible manner.

THE NEXT LITTLE WAR.
(By our Prophetic Reporter.)
THE C'abinet Council met once again on board the dag-ship, so
that its members might have an opportunity of being on the Spot in
conducting the necessary investigations. The Premier, as usual,
occupied the chair.
The First Lord of the Admiralty said that after consideration with
his colleagues, both naval and civil, he was forced to recommend the
carrying out of the scheme originally proiwsed five years ago. \\ ith
every wish to be economical, he could not sanction any further delay.
At this point the Council was interrupted by the appearance of a
Private Secretary, who informed the members that the combined
fleets of the allies were seen to be approaching.
The Premier declared himself extremely annoved at this intrusion.
He should have thought that Mr. TENTF.KFORE (the Private Secretary)
would have known better than to obtain admission at such a moment.
He (the Premier) must request that Mr. TENTEKFORE immediately
withdraw.
The Private Secretary having retired, proceedings were resumed.
The First Lord of the Admiralty continued his speech, and
strongly urged that something should be done at once to strengthen
the Navy. He (and his colleagues) reallv did not think that at a
time such as this, when war might be declared at any moment, it
would be wise or patriotic to delav further.
The Secretary of State for War. after such a declaration on the
part of his colleague, begged to add his voice to the entreaty. If the
Navy were not immediately strengthened he would not answer for
the safety of the country. The fleet was the first line of defence,
and the Army would be nothing without it.
The Private Secretary who had been recently expelled now put in
a second appearance. He said that he considered it his duty to
inform those present that the allied fleets seemed to be clearing for
action. This might mean nothing, or, on the other hand, a great
deal.
The Premier once more expressed his surprise at Mr. TENTKHFORE'S
conduct, and begged that he should again immediately withdraw.
The Private Secretary having retired, public business was
resumed.
The Premier, before deciding anything further, declared he would
like to learn the cause why the scheme had been hung up for so long
a period.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said a difficulty had arisen about
the price of tar. The tar quoted for the original estimate was a
penny a ton dearer than the Council thought reasonable, and it was
suggested to delay the execution of the scheme until a tar manu-
facturer could be obtained who would supply an estimate at the rate
selected. However, he had reason to believe that now he could flnd
such a manufacturer.
At this point the Private Secretary again hurried in to say that
the Allies had suddenly declared war, and were already engaged in
bombarding Herne Hay.
When our report left, the British flag-ship, without steam, was
attempting to evade the attentions of a number of torpedo boats of
the enemy's fleet. Further particulars (if possible) will be furnished
in a later edition.

THE NORMAN CONQUEST."
A WORD TO THE LORD CHANCELLOR.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—The LORD CHANCELLOR has once more
betrayed the best interests of the profession. As a loyal member of
the body of which he is the nominal head I am sorry to have to say
it, but what else can be said when it is recorded that he has refused
me silk, at a time when he has bestowed it upon Mr. AUGUSTINE
BIKKKLL, M.P., and Mr. GROSVENOH WOODS? I hope I shall not be
misunderstood. Against these two gentlemen I have nothing in the
world to say. The sin is one of omission rather than of commission.
As LEANIN BACKER, the wit of our Common Koom, said to me at
lunch to-day, "My dear EKNED, we 're all astounded not to see your
name in this batch of silks. Whatever can the L. C. have been
thinking about '•"
I may say that no effort on my part was wanting. I sent in my
application in ample time, with full particulars of the extent and
nature of my practice. The choice of the LORD CHANCELLOR leads
me to the conclusion that the present system of bestowing silk is
utterly rotten. Mr. BIRUELL and Mr. GROSVENOR WOODS have each
a large and flourishing practice. To be perfectlv frank, it would be
taking a rose-coloured view of the situation to call mine either. But
that was exactly why I wanted to be a stuff gownsman no longer.
The wretched solicitor who once told me that his office boy knew
more law than I did would almost certainly repent in hundred-
guinead briefs and lavish retainers to Mr. L. ERNED COUNSEL, (}.('.—
merely to write it is cxhilirating. With this official recognition of
merit—the hall-mark of our profession—there are no heights of legal
fame to which I feel I could not attain. I am willing to give Lord
HERSCHELL one more chance. Let him appoint me Attorney-General
of the Out-and-lnward Islands. It would be a wrench to leave
England, but if mv country calls upon me, I am content to be not at
home. If this is denied me, then, though I am sorry to threaten,
beware, my LORD CHANCELLOR, of the ghosts of disappointed,
unappointed Liberal J. P.'s!
Yours expectantly, L. ERNED COUNSEL.

COURT AT LAST!
MESSRS. BROOKFIELD and HICKS'S clever
theatrical rerue, Under the Clock, at the Court
Theatre, might have run throughout the
year and become a hardy annual, had they
adopted the simple process of extracting what-
ever became stale and unintelligible, and sub-
stituted for these withered leaves new matter
quite up to the latest date, with tunes by
EDWARD JONES, purveyor of harmonies,
equally up to time. The Sherlock Holmes part
of the burlesque was capital; the songs were
too long: but Miss LOKTTE VENNE'S Second
Mrs. T. was excellent, and her imitation of
Miss JULIA NEILSON, in her Ellenish-Terry-
ish style, was simply perfectj and might have
given a hint to the actress imitated. The four
Trees were funny, and one of them very good
(which, I don't know). These four Trees ought
to have done a "plantation dance." There
were some imitations, in this Bravo Hicks-
and-Brookfield burlesque, of somebodies which
puzzled even the confirmed theatre-goer, and
which were as double-Dutch to the ordinary
public. These puzzles might have been omitted,
or a board exhibited explaining them; and, as
it was impossible to keep the steam up for an
hour or so, the entertainment might have been
advantageously brought within the limits of
forty minutes. Alas T why was this not done?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
DALY'S NIGHTLY.
RARELY has SB AKSPEAKE'S fanciful comedy Tirclfth Night been put
on the London stage, except at the Lyceum, so perfectly as Mr. AVGTSTIN
DALY.has placed it on the stage of Daly's, where it must certainly
prove^an attraction for some time to come, and may induce Manager
DALT,to prolong his stay among- us. Kxcept in Taming the Xhreic,
Miss ADA REIIAN has neither been seen nor heard to such advan-
tage as in her imper-
sonation of Twin.
Perfectly are her
points made: most
intelligently and in-
telligibly arc all her
lines givo:i. Indeed,
there are some points
so well brought out
as to call forth a burst
of impulsive applause
as an immediate tri-
bute to what seems
to be a suddeu inspi-
ration on the part
of the actress. Miss
UEIIAN'S sole fault in
this character is a
tendency to restless-
ness. MissCATHERIXE
LEWIS is very good as
Maria, though she
goes so very nearovcr-
doing her laughing
as to make it sound
hysterical; vet in her
scene with her mis-
tress, when, full of
her practical joke
played on Mali-olid,
she is bursting with
almost uncontrollable
laughter while trying
to answer her mis-
tress seriously, her
bye-play is admirable.
Duke Orsino must
have possessed a rare
Ducal Opera House,
as the singers, play ers
., , ,,,,... and dancers at his
Shakapeare a l'Amcri,ame. Court (all belonging
to his own establishment, and never allowed to perform out of Orsino
Hall without special Ducal permission) are most excellent; and for
tune, time, unison, and harmony, they may back themselves to
compete with any other existing l> Operatic Company, Limited," be
it where it mav. When it conies to the turn of the principals to sing,
is not "O Mistress Mine" given bv Mr. LLOYD DAUBIGNY, the
Cloifii (also retained on the Ducal establishment so as to be ready for
Christmas time, when, no doubt, a charming fairy pantomime would
be got up for the benefit of the Duke's subjects and guests belonfrm?
to the "House Party"), exquisitely rendered by both the principal
singer, the Cluirn aforesaid (from whom at best the Duke has only a
right to expect the venerable "Hoi Cod/ins "), and the D. C. C.,
which initials may stand for the Ducal (or DALY) Court Chorus?
Of course the full measure of the humour in the scene where Sir
Toby comments upon Sir Andrew's written challenge, and likewise
of the humour there is in the duel scene, is not reached where Sir
Andrew is equal in height to Vinla, who, as represented by Miss
HEHAN, is a tine-grown youngster of apparently five foot nine at lea_st.
Probably SHAKSPEARE wrote the part of Sir Andreir for a dwarfish
member of his company, while that of 1 ~iola was written for a tall,
glim youth, just as the part of Maria was undoubtedly written to suit
a small boy, a real " low" comedian, as there are so many allusions
to her short stature and figure in the play. Imagine how the duel
scene would gain were the Sir Andreir a small man, of whom the
buxom young page is so desperately afraid! However, Sir Andrew
is well played by Mr. HERBERT GRESHAM, and if a little over-played,
his height must be taken into consideration. That Mr. JAMKS LEWIS
should be an excellent Sir Toby goes without saying • whatever he
turns his hand to he does well. Special mention should be made of
Mr. GEORGE CLARKE'S Mali-olio. Of all difficult Shakspearian parts,
with a tradition attached to it, this is one of the most, if not quite
the most difficult, and it is not too much to say that Mr. GEORGE
CLARKE plays it exceptionally well. Miss VIOLET VAXBBUGH is a most
elegant Countess Olicia, and Mr. Jon\ CRAIG a solid and " con-
vincing" (whatever this word may convey to my readers, it is quite
exhaustive to the writer) Duke Orsino, an indifferent part, by the

way, though SHAKSPEARE has given him some of his very best lines.
Judging the work as a whole, Mr. DALY, author and manager, has
done_his stage editing of SIIAKSPEARE'S play most effectively. Of
such cuts as he has made, most modern dramatists of any consider-
able experience will approve. It strikes me, while reading over the
original, "as she was wrote," that
while it is one of the Divine WIL-
LIAM'S happiest inspirations, it was also
written currente calamo, and without
subsequent correction. Several circum-
stances ixiint to this conclusion, and one
especially, i.e., the re-entrance of Mal-
rolio in the last scene (wisely omitted
in DALY'S version), when he is brought
on to explain about the Captain, and
makes his exit very angrily, without
even having uttered one single word of
the explanation which he was brought
on by SHAKSPEAUE to give! When he
has gone, the Duke exclaims, as an
after-thought, probably introduced
after the first performance, or at the
last rehearsal, " He hath not told us of
the Captain yet." How sharply would
the modern SHAKSPEARE Junior be
taken to task by the critics for such
carelessconstruction! And the Fanciful
Comedy ends like a modern extrava-
ganza, with a song. Delightful! Of
course, in SHAKSPEARE'S time, this was
the epilogue, sung after all the dramatis
persona: had disappeared. At Daly's
it is sung as a duet between Maria
and the Clown—a very happy idea—
with chorus and dance by the Unsur-
passed Private Ducal Operatic Com- jg^
pany in the pay of Duke Orsino. One
thing I should like Duke DALY to omit,
and that is, the red splotch on the white
handkerchief that binds Sir Tuby's
cracked skull in the last scene; and
one thing I and every one would like . .
him to insert, and that is the re-ap-AdJ? ,Reha",,?8 " ^?un£ l^"
I*arance of jolly old Sir Toby, who fth™' ^"F6 thc antl1uo
won't be put to bed, but who should Ill*n>al shoes->
shake himself quit of Sir Andreir, and re-appear in the alcove
above, with a flagon, drinking a happy New \ ear to every one, a!
very Twelfth Night king! But then ire are naturally prejudiced in
favour of Toby, and, everywhere, Toby is a popular character.

BALLADE OF THE MAN OF EXPERIENCE.
WHEN I was young I did not like to show
My ignorance to every fellow-flat;
But now I 'm not ashamed of "I don't know"
What I 've not had a chance of getting at.
Besides, the knowing ones soon smell a rat—
The lack of skill or knowledge we would hide;
The game's not worth the candle-wick and fat;—
Expertu crede—trust the man who tried.
A friend of mine^-or should I say a foe ?—
Who had an Irish hunter, known as "Pat,"
Once said, "Get on him, JACK, and let him go."
Now, though I muttered inly—call it "drat!"—
I leaped across. Alas! not long I sat
In mounted majesty. One cannot ride
The high horse, minus stirrup, rein; and hat;—
Expertu crede—trust the man who tned.
I 've had my fill of poverty, if so
A man may put it. There's no plutocrat
Among my kin • and often funds are low;
But care, with ninefold slaughter, killed a eat.
I 've still a sixpence by me, though on that
One can't go far. Here s SANDY from the Clyde;
When you have got the "pawky chiel" to chat,
Experto crede—trust the man who tried.
Encoi.
Youth, heed an old domestic diplomat,
Do not begin to " educate" your oride,
Nor try your "prentice hand at tit for tat;—
Experto crede—trust the man who tried.

A DIARY IN A NUTSHELL.
DEAR MR. PUXCH,—I read some little while since a not unin-
teresting article upon the subject of keeping a diary. The writer
suggested various modes of telling the story of a life day by day.
His suggestions were fairly practical, and on that account I respect
them. Still, to my mind, they did not seem perfect. What we want
is the most work in the least time. I trust that desideratum is
obtained in mv model diary, which I have now the honour to present to
you. You will notice it occupies very little space, and consequently
on that score may be worthy of publication. Here it is:
January.—(1.) Began the year well with a considerable sum at my
bankers. Good friends with all my relatives. (2.) Commenced the
year badly with an overdraw, and a number of neglected county court
summonses. Quarrelled with all my relatives, and engaged in law
suits with half of them.
February.—(1.) Invested at the proper moment, and netted a
good round sum. (2.) My foreign stocks went down with a run, and
I have lost all I once possessed.
March.—(1.) Took to the turf, and trained any number of winners.
(2.) Having partially retrieved my fortunes, plunged on a favourite,
and again lost everything.
April.—(1.) Proposed to an heiress and was accepted. (2.) Jilted a
penniless beauty and was summoned for breach of promise.
May.—(1.) Started on a pleasant yachting trip to the Mediterranean,
and had a lovely voyage all the way (2.) Went on board a boat
bound for Antwerp, and came to grief at Hcrne Bay.
June.—(1.) Entered for the Rose Show, and got all the prizes. (2.)
Unusual frost killed every plant in the place.
July.—(1.) Took a tour through Europe on horseback, and had a good
time. (2.) Started a bicycle, and came to grief in Regent's Park.
August.—(1.) Totheseaside, wherelthoroughlyenjoyedthebathing.
(2.) Took furnished watering-place apartments, and contracted the
influenza.
September.—(1.) Went out shooting, and contributed, probably, the
largest bag of the season. (2.) Tried a few coverts, and shot my
host's favourite dog.
October. — (1.) Rented a theatre, and realised a fortune in less than
no time. (2.) Put my all in the shares of a music-hall, which went
immediately into voluntary liquidation.
A'orember.—(1.) Accepted a baronetage. (2.) Expelled from my
favourite club.
I)ecember.—(1.) Presented with the freedom of the city of my
native town. (2.) Brought up before the Court of Bankruptcy in
London.
There, Mr. Punch, you have everything in a concise form. All
that the diary-keeper has to do is to strike out either No. 1 or No. 2,
and preserve the remaining moiety. Yours truly,
THE MAN WITH A HEAD.
LADY JOURNALISTIC ASIDES.
[" Do the editors of the ladies' papers really pretend that they arc not
perfectly well aware that the mnjoritv of lady journalists who write chatty
little articles bringing in the name of somebody 8 soap, or somebody else's
bonnets or coal-scuttles, receive graceful acknowledgments in a substantial
form from the recommended tradesmen ?"—A Jf oman Journalist in the

Are quite Al—their art designs most subtle,
Their furniture of quite delightful ease."
(If I can choose I'll hare a new coal-scuttle.)
"At MADAME A.'s there's such a charming hat,
The prosiest well could write a poem on it,
The price three guineas, and dirt cheap at that."

A LESSON FOR GRANDMAMMA.
(A Dialogue arranged for Representatives of the Past and the Present,}
Grandmamma. And now, my dear, that I have come from the

Grandmamma. Well, no. I want to sec The Second Mrs.

Grand-daughter. They did, but now it's getting a little out of
date. But, my dear Grannie, you mustn't go and see it; it's
scarcely the sort of piece for you.
Grandmamma. Why not? Hasn't it a good plot? Isn't it well
acted?
Grand-daughter. Yes; but you see it's a little advanced. A
widower marries a second time, and his second wife is not quite so
good as his first.
Grandmamma, What do you mean by that?
Grand-daughter. Well, she belongs to a different class of life; in
fact, I really find it embarrassing to explain further. Why not go
somewhere else 'i
Grandmamma. Certainly. I am told Soiring the Wind is also
very good. What's that about?
Grand-daughter. Well, much the same ns The Second Mrs, Tan-
querai/. I really think you had better select something else. I am
told that the Drury Lane Pantomime is really immense. You had
better come and see it.
Grandmamma. Thanks, but I prefer a comedy. How about An
Old Jew 1 surely that wjjl do?
Grand-daughter. Well, I am not sure. You see, the leading
incident is scarcely suited to a lad}' of your age. You will be shocked
if you go.
Grandmamma, But surely at seventy-five I have come to years of
discretion! AVhat is there wrong about An Old Jen-?
Grand-daughter. Oh, nothing in particular, save But there,
I really cannot tell you. It is so embarrassing! But now take my
advice. The drama is too realistic for you. You want milder
food than our modern playwrights can give you. So take my advice,
and go back.
Grandmamma. But I did so want to go! But if you really think
it would be better
Grand-daughter. I am sure of it. So take all your boxes, bags, and
things, and he off. There's nothing for you here. You are too
innocent for the end of the century.
Grandmamma. But half a century ago I was the life and soul of
everything.
Grand-daughter. Yes ; but even in those days you drew the line
somewhere, and we don't. So you had better go back to the
country.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
"IF there is one serial issue
above another for whose ex-
istence I am truly thankful,"
quoth the Baron, "it is the
Dryburgh Edition of the
H acerley Novels, whereof the
fourteenth volume has just ap-
peared." The Baron regrets
that his many and vastly varied
occupations prevent him from
reading each novel as it comes
out, but he takes them up from
time to time, and, while under
the spell of the Wizard of the
North, he prefers them to the
most modern novels and ro-
mances, no matter by what
talented author they may be
written.
"Yet," continues the same
eminent critic, "it is some
considerable time, since I have
been so fascinated by any
modern work of fiction as I
have been by MARY CEIOLMON-
DELEY'S novel entitled Diana
Tempest." Ere now a large
proportion of the Baron's
mends will have read this
work (though a still larger
number await the Baron's
imprimatur), for Mr. BENT-
LEY announces that he is pub-
lishing the second edition of it,
and these will agree with the
Baron in recommending it
strongly, nay, in pressing it on
the attention of those who have
not vet read it, or, were it
possible, in thrusting it under
the very noses, or before the
very eyes and into the hands of
those who, loving a really good

and in literary style, will be

chase or loan, the goods, the
extra good goods, which the
gods provide. Let no regular
novel-reader be alarmed when
the Baron informs him that
there is neither page nor para-
graph in these three volumes
that can be skipped without
loss to the skipper. Each cha-
racter is carefully analysed,
in so incisive and epigrammatic
a style, and witn evidently
so rare a knowledge of moral
anatomy, as will occasionally
remind the reader of THACKE-
RAY'S handling of his puppets.
Oddly enough, the end of the
story comes when the hero says
to the heroine, "Di! Di!" and
then—they lire happily ever
afterwards. The Baron wishes
his friends no worse luck than
a rainj' afternoon for the
perusal of Diana Tempest.
It must have struck several
persons on reading the number
of the Strand Magazine for
January that the first story
[being No. VII. of "TheDiary
of a Doctor"] ought to have
been called "All Her Eye."
The illustration to this brief
tale is an eye-witness to the
raison d'etre of this correc-
tion. By the way, was the title
for the series suggested by
SAMUEL WARREN'S well-
known Diari/ of a Late Phy-
sician, which, giving EDGAR
ALLEN POE'S tales the first,
and the author of Uncle Silas
the next place in our private

THE BARON DEB.-W.
A MELTING MOMENT FOR WAX.
(By Our Up-to-DaU Reporter.)
THE moment the decision (subject to appeal) was announced, I
rushed off to the figures in the Maryleboue Koad with a view to
ascertaining their views upon the subject. As a whole, they seemed
quite satisfied with their surroundings.
"I have very little complaint to make," said the effigy of the first
Sir BARTLE FRERE; "it is true I am now on a level with the
Refreshment Department, but still I have the satisfaction of know-
ing that I am assisting (at a distance) at the last moments of MARY,
Queen of Scots. If I might make a suggestion, I would prefer not
to be addressing a Zulu Lady, and would be glad to hear the strains
of the band above."
"I have certainly been moved about a good deal," returned the
portrait model of thelate CHARLES DICKENS. "But my present quarters
are fairly good. I have the satisfaction of noticing my old friends
SALA and TENNYSON in adjacent cell-like apartments, and catching a
glimpse of Mr. G. R. SIMS. This is a decided improvement after my
site at Baker Street, where I seemingly exercised a vague super-
vision over the Guide Books."
"Well, it is certainly more cheerful here than it used to be in the
extra rooms," admitted the likeness in wax of XAPOLEON III., "and
all my family seem to prefer it. Of course the additional sixpence gave
a sort of air to our group, but the proximity of the execution party
down below was distinctly derogatory to our dignity."
"But you are going back, arc vou not, to your old quarters?"
"Very possibly. But we are fairly comfortable where we are."
"I have to complain of nothing save my scowl," said King
JOHN. "I should not mind it so much were I not looking towards
Mr. IRVING, Miss TERRY, and the BANCROFTS. I do hope that the
excellent quartette of histrionics do not consider my rudeness in-
tentional. Had I my way I would not make a face at any one of
them. On my word, I wouldn't; it is too bad!"
"Well, yes; I think I would apply for an injunction if I could,"
was the. answer of WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE. r' I have seen myself
in a glass, and look a dreadful guy. If I had shown myself in this
form while acknowledging the cry of 'Author!' on the first night
of Hamlet, I really think I should have been hooted."
"Don't ask me!" said the Old Lady herself; "I hate these new-
fangled ideas. Besides, I have got quite enough to do attending on
the Sleeping Beauty. However, if you must have my opinion, let
me say that I would put that football group into the Chamber of
Horrors; and as for MARY, Queen of Scots, being near the grill, and
close to the steaks, why I think it most appropriate. Isn't HER
MAJESTY, with the Executioner just behind her, on the point of
having a chop?"
And then the Old Lady laughed so long and heartily that I lost
my presence of mind, and came prematurely away. As I quitted
the rooms, it seemed to me that CHARLES THE FIRST was trying to
obtain an injunction compelling the chronic absence of CROMWELL,
and Dr. NEWMAN was asking, on behalf of the Public, for Pius IX.

SO LAKELY!
SIB,—Ho\v anybody can pre-
tend that Windermere is a
pleasant spot for winter residence
is truly astonishing. If you want
a really dry, warm place, try
Coniston. As for rain, we hardly
ever see it. Indeed, we are
talking: of importing- a special
rain-maker from the Congo, as a
shower now and then would he
an advantage. Mr. RCSKIN (who
lives here) has written a local
guide-book which he calls Hortus
Siccus—or is it Hor/its Inclusits i
—and that prores how dry the
climate is. During the recent
"cold snap" all over England,
Coniston was probably the only
place where not a single house
7iad a fire burning in it.' There
is excellent accommodation here,
too; my own lodgings are about
the best in the place. Why go
to Cannes when Coniston is almost
at your door?
LANCASHIRE LACUSTRIAN.
SIR,—The claims of Winder-
mere as a place for wintering in
are simply aDsurd. When it isn't
a misty swamp, it's an ice-
house. The average rainfall there
has never been ascertained, as no
instrument-maker has a rain-
gauge with enough inches on it to
mark the amount that falls. Now
at Ambleside we're obliged to
have punkahs going all through
January, and not a drop of rain
has fallen for three months, so
you can tell what a delightful
winter-resort this must be, and
it is very easy to get to, as coaches
meet all the trains on the Kendal
Line; and I ought to know, as
I happen to own them. N.B.—I
hope nobody will be deceived by
the shallow artifices of Coniston

people, who are, I hear, trying
to pass off that one-horse village
as dry and warm. They boast
that not a single h're was lit there
in the recent frost; and why?
Because not a ton of coal could be
brought to the place, owing to
snow-blocked roads, and the trees
were frozen so hard no axe would
cut them! Comment is needless.
WESTMORLAND WISEACRE.
SIR,—Let everybody who isn't
a Polar bear avoid Ambleside in
winter. It ought to be called
Archangel instead! No rain, they
assert, has fallen there for months.
'This is quite true, because there
has been nothing but snow and
hail. For real comfort and warmth
come to Keswick—especially to
my hotel here. Keswick is dry
enough in summer (particularly
during the "Convention " week),
but the dryness is much greater
now. Invalids bathe in the lake
all through the winter, and find
the water too hot.' We are close
to Borrowdale, and, as I daresay
you know, that valley was so-
called because the inhabitants
have to borrow all their water
from places where rain does some-
times fall. Derwentwater itself
derives its name from an African
prince who once visited it, and
remarkedon " der want o' water,"
and the title stuck. The poor
prince died of a sunstroke on
Christmas Day, it is said. Such
heat was probably a little ex-
ceptional, but people who 've been
at Algiers in winter-time say it
can't be compared with Keswick.

ADMIRABLE in every way is Mr. HAKE'S
performance of the part of" The Old Jew in
one of the dullest pieces it has ever been my
lot to see. Five Acts of it, too! Written
by Mr. SYDNEY GBUNDY, author of Sou-ing
the Wind! Hardly possible to believe, but
so it is. If what the author intends for satire
had only been partially redeemed by here
and there a flash of wit or humour, the acting
of Mr. HAKE, of the three GILBERTS—GIL-
DEBT HARE, GILBERT FAKQUHAR, and GILBERT
TRENT, of Messrs. ANSON, DAY, DE LANGE,
and ROBERT HABWOOD (a most amusing
"bit" of character), and the acting of Miss
KATE RORKE and Mrs. WEIGHT, the latter
appearing in a most trying and unsympa-
thetic part, might have secured for it a certain
amount of success. But what can possibly
be done with an uninteresting story, told
depressingly in Five Acts? It is preceded
by THEYRE SMITH'S A Case for Eviction.
But if ever there were " a ease for eviction,"
it is that of " An Old Jew," and consequently
out of the bill he goes; and, to adapt the
refrain of Mr. GBUNDY'S song in the piece,
we, "Unforgiving, bid it at least Good-bye!''
And so farewell, Old Jew! And, "if"
ever, then for ever, fare thee well!"

FLUFF SITS FOR HIS PHOTOGRAPH;
OB, THE IXSTAXTAXEOrS PROCT5RS.
SCENE — A Photographer's Studio on the Seventh Fluor. It is n
warm afternoon. Mr. STIPPLKR, Photographic Artist, is dis-
corered alone.
Mr. Stippler (to himself). No appointments while this weather
lasts, thank goodness! I shall be able to pet ahead with those
negatives now. (Sharp whistle from ipeakmg-tubf. to which he
goes.) Well?
Voice of Lady Assistant (in simp belrnr). Lady just brought her
dog in; wants to know if she can have it taken now.
Mr. Slip, (to himself). Oh, dash the dog and the lady too!
The 1'oice. No, only the dog, the lady says.
Mr. 8tip. (confusta). Eh? Oh, exactly. Ask the lady to have the
goodness to — ah — step up. (He opens the studio door, and aicaits
the arrival of his client; interval, at the end of which sounds as of n
female in distress about half way doirn are distinctly audible.)
She's stepping up. (Anothei
inter ral. The head of a breath-
less Elderly Lady emerges from
the gloom.) This way, Madam.
f The Elderly Lady (entering,
and sinking into the first plush
chair). Oh, dear me. I thought I
should nerer get to the top! Now
why can't you photographers
have your studios on the ground
floor? So m uch more convenient!
Mr. Stip. No doubt, Madam,
no doubt. But there is — ah — a
Prejudice in the profession in
ivah of the roof; possibly the
light is considered somewhat
supcriah. I thought I under-
stood there was — an — a dog?
The E. L. Oh, he '11 be here
presently. I think he saw some-
thing in one of the rooms on
the way up that took his fancy,
or very likely he's resting on
one of the landing mats, — such
an intelligent dog! I '11 call
an intelligent og! I' call
him. Fluffy, Fluffy, come along,
my pet, nearly up now! Mustn't
keep his missis waiting for him.
(A ten/ long pause: presently
a small rough-haired terrier
lounges into the studio with an
air of proprietorship.) That's
the dog; he's so small, he can't
take very long to do, can he?
Mr. Slip. The — ah — precise
size of the animal does not sig-
nify, Madam; we do it by an
instantaneous process. The only
question is the precise pose you
would prefer. I presume the
dog is a good— ah — rattah?
The F.. L. Really, I've no
idea. But he's rery clever at killing bluebottles; he trill smash
them on the window-panes.
Mr. Slip, (without interest). I see, Madam. We have a speciality
for our combination backgrounds, and you might like to have him
represented on a country common, in the act of watching a hole in
a bank.
The E. L. (impressed). For bluebottles?
Mr. Hlii>. For — ah — rats, (liy u-ay of concession.) Or blue-
bottles, ( f course, if you prefer it.
The E. L. \ think I would rather have something more charac-
teristic. He has such a pretty way of lying on his back with all his
paws sticking straight up in the air. I never saw any other dog do it.
Mr. Stip. Precisely. But I doubt whether that" particular pose
would be effective — in a photograph.
The E. L. You think not? Where has he got to, now? Oh, do
just look at him going round, examining everything! He quite
understands what he 's wanted to do; you 've no idea what a clever
dog he is!
Mr. Stip. Ray-ally? How would it do to have him on a rock in
the middle of a salmon-stream?
The E. L. It would make me so uncomfortable to see it; he has a
perfect horror of wetting his little feet!
Mr. Stip. In that case, no doubt - Then what do you say to
posing him on an ornamental pedestal? We could introduce a York-
shire moor, or a view of Canterbury Cathedral, as a background.
Fluff (/o himself). "Whnt'» shr got hold of note!
The E. L. A pedestal seems so suggestive of a cemetery, doesn't it?
Mr. Stip. Then we must trv some other position. (He resigns
himself to the commonplace.) Can the dog—ah—sit up?
The E. L. Bee-yutifully f Fluffy, come and show how nicely you
can sit up!
Fluff (to himself). Show off for this fellow? Who pretends he's
got rats—and hasn't! Not if /know it!
[He rolls orer on his back with a irell-assiuned air of idiolcy.
The E. L. (delighted). There that'f, the attitude I told you of. But
perhaps it iroiild come out rather too leggy?
Mr. Stip. It is—ah—open to that objection, certainly, Madam.
Perhaps we had better take him on a chair, sitting up. (Fluff is, with
infinite trouble, prerni/ed upon to mount an arm-chair, from which
he groir/n sarage/y whenever Mr. STIPI.KR approaches.) \ou will
; probably be more successful with him than I, Madam.
The E. L. I could make him sit up in a moment, if I had any of his
i biscuits with me. But I forgot to bring them.
Mr. Stip. There is a conf ectionah next door. We could send out
a lad for some biscuits. About how much would you requiah—a
quartah of a pound?
[lie goes to the speaking
tube.
The E. L. He won't eat all
those; he's a most abstemious
dog. But they must be street,
tell them. (Delay. Arrival of
the biscuits. The Elderly Lady
holds one up, and Fluff leaps,
barking frantically, until he
succeeds in snatching it; a
manoeuvre which he repeats
with each successive biscuit.)
Do you know, I 'm afraid he
really mustn't have any more—
biscuits always ercite him so.
Suppose you take him lying on
the chair, much as he is now?
(Mr. STIFLER attempts to place
the dog's patrs, and is snapped
at.) Oh, do be careful!
Mr. Stip. (heroically). Oh, it's
of no consequence, Madam. I
um—ah—accustomed to it.
The E. L. Oh, yes; but he
isn't, you know; so please be
reru gentle with him! And
could you get kim a little water
tirst? I 'm sure he 's thirsty.
(Mr. STIPLEH brings water in a
developing dish, tchich Fluff
empties promptly.) Now he '11
be as good!
Mr. Stip. (after wiping Fluff's
chin and arranging his legs). If
we can only keep him like that
for one second.
The E. L. But he ought to
have his ears pricked. (Mr.
STIPLEK mak?s weird noises be-
hind the camera, resembling
demon cats in torture; Fluff
Oh, and his hair is all in his

eyes, and they 're his best feature!
[Mr. STIPLEK attempts to part Fluff's fringe: snarls.
Mr. Stip. I have not discovered his eyes at present, Madam; but
he appears to have excellent—ah—teeth.
The E. L. Hiisn't he! Now, couldn't you catch him like that?
Mr. Stip. (to himself). He's more likely to catch me like that!
(Aloud, as he retreats under a hanging canopy.) 1 think we shall
get a good one of him as he is. (Focussing.) Yes, that will do
'very nicely. (He puts in the plate, and prepares to release the
shutter, whereupon Fluff deliberately rises and presents his tail to
the camera.) I presume you do not desiah a back view of the dog,
Madam!
The E. L. Certainly not! Oh, Fluffy, naughty—naughty! Now
lie down again, like a good dog. Oh, I 'm afraid he's going to sleep!
Mr. Stip. If you would kindly take this—ah—toy m your hand,
Madam, it might rouse him a little.
The E. L. (exhibiting a gutta-percha rat). Here, Fluffy, Fluffy,
here's a pitty sing! What is it,eh!
Fitiff (after opening one eye). The old fool fancies she's got a rat!
Well, she may keep it! [He curls himself up again.
Mr. Stip. We must try to obtain more—ah—animation than that.
[He hands the Elderly Lady a jingling toy.
The E. L. (shaking it rigorously). Fluffy, see what Missis has

For all the fat " a double debt to pay."

And bone, is what mere skin and bone;

These many blessings—can't we share
And share alike, old boy.

Old oriental rug.

A sky that's dazzling bine:
You 've everything at your command—
A lucky chap are you!

Good-bye to you, old patriarch,
There in yonr frame of gold—'

WE read that in Belgium marriage certi-
ficates, already for some time past in book
form, are henceforth to be morocco-bound and
gilt-edged, suggestive of durability, and
gilding the pill, some will say. A summary
of the Belgian laws on the married state is
given herein. Then amongst a mass of mis-
cellaneous information are directions for the
feeding and care of infants—surely? Our eye
ran oh hastily, then came back carefully, but
no! This conspicuous omission seems the
more unaccountable and ominous upon the
historic battle-ground of Europe. However,
to proceed, there are also provided twelve
spaces for entering the names and birthdays
of the children of the marriage; and, we
doubt not, the national motto, L' Union fait,
la Force, is well to the fore. If after all this
plain statement of the case the marriage rate
remains undiuiinished, who shall deny honour

about us. and if she has we want you to know it 's all a mistake.
She asked us this morning if we wanted what we thought she called
some kind of "jar," and we said "No," not in the least under-
standing that she intended to say " icanderjahr." Now that we find
that she was taking what Pa (wno 's in the House) calls one of Ma's
snatch-votes, and that the meaning of it all is latch-keys and staying
out late, of course we should like it. Poor dear Mamma does (five
us such a time of it. I wonder what she 'd do if she knew that all
the boys have had latch-keys made like Pa's, and that the chain
which goes up religiously every night at 11 o clock is so long that
you cjui undo it from outside. We three girls are determined to
have latch-keys, read "Latch-Key Notes " (is that right ?), thoroughly
indulge our primeval traits," and generally have a real good time.
—Yours wanderjahring, MAMMA'S THREE DAUGHTEKS.
DBA* SIR.—Would you mind telling me what "a mild kind of
wanderjahr" means? I asked REGGIE, my brother, to-day, and he
said he thought a smoke of some kind. Ma says she fancies it's
German for influenza. Pa, when I asked him at breakfast, only
A MERE SCHOOL-GIRL.
JOHNSONESE.
"LET observation with extensive new
Survey mankind from China to Peru."
Tautology indeed! Here half an eye
Would serve mankind, we fancy, to descry
A lexicographer; but, shelving this,
A more important point appears amiss.
Was ever order, large, to say the least,
More loosely given? Looking east-south-east
From shore to shore (the way you 'd travel, mind)
You 'd miss, as much as possible, mankind!
THE SAGA OF THE SHIELD-MAIDEN.
[A "Viking Club" has recently been founded, with a "Jnrl" for
rresident. (Please pronounce Jf'eakina, Yarl.) Other officials are called
"Things-bothman," "Skatt-taker," &c., while the lady members are
designated S/ciald-maijar, or "Shield-maidens." According to the pro-
spectus, "it behoves everyone interested in the North to give it such
support as will entitle it to take Us proper place among the foremost societies
of Europe." The italics are ours.]
IF you 're Weaking, call me Yarly, skal me Yarly, mother dear!
For we've started a Norsemen's Club in town—we began with the
young New Year!
I don't know whether I sound the word in the proper Icelandic way,
But I'm to be one of the Skiald-maijar—a. Shield-maiden, that's to
say!
There '11 be many a black, black eye, mother, in the club to-morrow
night.
For the Things-bothman and the Law-bothman have together
arranged to fight:
While the stakes will be held by the Skatt-taker, and the Jarl will
join the fray,
And we Shield-maidens will shriek and whoop in old Norse, as
best we may!
If we seratch up a scanty Scanian skill with skald and skal and ski,
In the foremost place of societies in Europe soon we '11 be!
To-morrow's to be of all the year our first Walhalla-day,
And I 'm to be chief Shield-maiden, and proud Vi-queen of the May!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

DREAMED IN THE TEMPLE.
(A Communication from an
old Contributor.)
A MATTER of so much im-
portance has recently attracted
the attention of the Bench
that I feel it my duty to call
serious consideration to it in
the columns of a paper that
has been renowned all the
world over as the organ of
the legal profession. 1 need
scarcely say that I refer to a
decision that a barrister-at-
law, although he may be ready
and anxious to practise, can be
called upon to serve on a jury
unless he can say in open
Court that he has received a
brief within six months! With
all due respect to the judge
who is answerable for the
ruling, I must, declare that 1
consider such an announcement
made from the seat of justice
an intolerable wrong to a large
number of worthy, if unfor-
tunate, professional men. In
years gone by I have shown in
these very pages that circum-
stances over which he has had
no control may prevent a
counsel really learned in the
law from attracting the lucra-
tive attention of solicitors.
Taking my own case, I can
say that, although I have since
my call enjoyed a very grati-
fying practise, I have known
it happen that I have not
received a brief for months, I
might almost add (without
laying myself open to a charge
of gross exaggeration) years
together. It is not because a
man has rooms at the top of a
staircase of chambers in the
Temple, and pays a guinea a
year for a locker in the Carey
Street Robing Room, that he
can secure the suffrages of those he would willingly count amongst
his clients. I have made it my custom of a forenoon (following in
the footsteps of my father) to attend regularly at one or other of the
courts of the Queen's Bench Division to extend a matutinal greeting
to the presiding judge. This I have done to show my respect for
the profession to which his lordship and I in common belong. That
I have not had any papers before me requiring immediate attention
(save perhaps the current literature of the time) has been no fault of
mine. If Bedford Row, Ely Place, and Lincoln's Inn Fields are so
blind to the best interests of the litigation-loving public that thev
do not retain me is their business, and their business only, and I
refuse to take any responsibility in this strange, this deplorable
business—business that has been called (by members of my own
family) absolutely disgraceful.
And having given this my deliberate opinion upon the affair, I
should have thought my duty performed, had not something remained
behind. As a rule, I do not attach any serious importance to visions
or dreams, but on the present occasion I
am inclined to accept as reliable evidence
that which at other times I might declare
to be of questionable value. Since the
decision to which I have referred no doubt
the matter has frequently occupied my
thoughts, and possibly—I might almost
say probably—the clue to the mystery can
be found in that admission. Having con-
fessed as much, it may be well to give the
story in extenso.
After a day's hard work at my chambers
setting the circulars I had received during
the past half year in order, I fell asleep,
and, in a state of somnolence, found myself
on my legs in one of the Courts of the
Q. B. D. I was naturally surprised to find
"A PAINTED LADY."
"0, MUMMY DEAR, WHY DID PAPA SAY HE WAS THISKINU OF HAVING
YOU PAINTED BY SlR JOHN MlLLAIS? I'M SURK HE WOULDN'T DO IT
BETTER THAN YOU DO IT YOURSELF!"
"ETHEL, DEAR, I THINK YOU HAD BETTER GO AND PLAY is THE NURSERY
WITH YOUR LITTLE BROTHER I"
!
myself in such a posture, as
usually I remain seated, except
on those occasions to which I
have referred, when it is cus-
tomary for the Bench to greet
the Bar.
"My Lord," I found myself
saying, " I respectfully insist
: that, during the last six
i months, I have practised the
profession to which you, my
Lord, and I, my Lord, have
both the honour to belong."
"Of course, Mr. BRIEF-
LESS," replied the Judge, "I
would not doubt your word for
a second; but as we have had
the pleasure of seeing you here
for many years in what may
be termed an expectant atti-
tude, it would be most inter-
esting if you would be so
kind as to give fuller and
better particulars."
"With your Lordship's fa-
vour, I shall be delighted to do
so," was my prompt reply. '' I
have appeared recently in the
case of Briefless v. Brieflets."
"Dear me," said his Lord-
ship; "I do not remember it.
Where was it heard '•"
"As the amount in dispute
was under the sum warranting
an appeal to the Superior
Courts, my Lord, the action was
foughtout in the CountyCourt."
"Indeed," observed the
Judge; "and if it is not indis-
creet, may I ask what was the
cause of action 'f"
"Certainly, my Lord," and
I bowed; "1 shall be only too
]>lc:iM'd to give you the full
particulars."
"You are very good," put
in his Lordship.' "We shall
be glad to hear you."
As your Lordship pleases.
The plaintiff sought to recover
£15 from the defendant for in-
different board and lodging. It
had been arranged that the plaintiff should board and lodge with the
defendant at the rate of £20 a quarter. At the end of the first
quarter the plaintiff considered that he had received only £5 worth
of board and lodging, and consequently was entitled to recover £15
balance. You see, my Lord?"
"Certainly; and I presume that your client had paid the £20?"
"Well, not exactlv, my Lord. But then the defendant did not
raise that plea. She nad been advised by counsel not to do so."
"Dear me! And who was the counsel?"
"Well, mv Lord, I myself made the suggestion."
"Really, Mr. BRIKFLESS, I am surprised at such an admission!
You appear for the plaintiff and advise the defendant! Surely that
was ultra rircs /"
"I venture to think not, my Lord, as the defendant was my wife."
"I see your contention—that she was a part of yourself. But
surely the'Married Woman's Property Act disposes of^that point?
However, let that pass. And the plaintiff—who was he?"
"My son, my Lord," I replied, with
emphasis; my son, my Lord! And that
justice might be done, I have paid all the
costs. And now, my Lord, you see the
shifts"
I woke. PORTINOTON was beside me.
"I think this is for you, Sir," said he,
holding out a paper. I seized it with a
gleam of hope. It was only a form for the
assessment of income-tax.
And now I am debating whether I shall
follow the suggestion of my dream or not.
It seems to me the only course I can pursue
until Elv Place ceases to be inattentive,
and Bedford Row becomes more kind.

Brown (startled by rushing animal, which has lulled, just as he teas going to putter over where the rail is down). "Now THEN, WHERE
AKE YOU GOING TO?" Groom. "DON'T KNOW 1 AsK THIS BRUTE!"
SONGS OF SOCIETY.
THE HAPPY HEDONIST'S CREED.
I '11 of the Cyrenaic School,
A Pleasure-hunting Hedonist;
I hold the World's most arrant fool
An Altruist.
An Aristippus of the Club,
IIy faith is firm in self and sense;
My love of comfort and choice " grub"
Immense.
Perfectibility I deem
A figment, which iny soul revolts.
All those who dream that dotard's dream
Are dolts.
Of all loud follies that infest
This period of stress and storm,
] do most cordially detest
lieform!
The word's on everybody's tongue.
I know that it is but a word,
Making the speaker, old or young,
Absurd!
But there be words which din and dun
Until they seem far worse than blows,
And this, upon my soul, is one
Of those.
"Mesopotamia" sounded sweet
On the dissenting Durden's ears,
And this " Reform" the maudlin greet
With cheers.
'Tis like those " loyal toasts" outgushed
In hackneyed terms when Britons dine,
And which the witless cheer, when flushed
With wine.
They bore one awfully, they tax
The speakers, put the hearers out,
Yet all enthusiastic wax,
And shout.
So with "Reform." When it is named
By Premier, scribe, or platform prig,
Humbugs applaud, and shams, unshamed,
Look big.
What does it mean? If aught at all
(Which usually it does not),
It means the rule despotical
Of "Rot,"
It signifies the utter rout
Of all whose motto is "Enjoy!"
Of every pleasure that's without
Alloy!
It means that Twaddle on a Tub
Shall rob me of my cent-per-cents,
My wine, my weed, my cab, my club,
"My rents.
It means that Fustian with a vote
Shall push Me from my pleasant perch
Of Privilege. The hand which smote
The Church,
Would smite the Land, and smash the Law,
And, SAMSON-like, Caste's bastions storm,
All with that modern Ass's jaw,
Reform.
Et aprt-s? Afterwards, of course
The Many would "put on the screw,
And subjugate by brainless force
The Few.
Now is it not preposterous stuff?
The world's whole stock of Pleasure 's
small,
And obviously is not enough
For all.
The Romans knew this. What a State!
NERO is my ideal, quite.
We must spread Toil, and concentrate
Delight.
There 's the true Social Formula,
Purged from humanitarian bosh.
The monstrous maxim of to-day
Won't wash.
The greatest number's greatest good?
You might as well sav "ortolans round!'
Or claim for every hind his rood
Of ground.
Children of Gibeon must exist
To hew and draw, fifty to one;
That gives the happy Hedonist
Life's fun.
That's Nature's law, as wise men know,
To keep "the fittest" snug and warm,
With but one formidable foe
Reform!
STILL "THE DARK CONTINENT."—The sub-
ject of "Africa opened up," it appears from
M. CAMILLE DOUUET'S statement, has not
inspired any of the competitors for the annual
prize for poetry, granted by the French State,
with a poem worthy of the name. There
will be no happy prize-winner to "speak of
Africa and golden joys." We are surprised,
and suppose we must now look upon "Ex
Africa semper aliqtiid nori" as another of
our old beliefs gone over to the majority.
SHE HAS GOT IT QUITE RIGHT THIS TIME.—
Mrs. R., who is a great playgoer, expresses
herself as being very sorry to hear that The
Oh! Joe is to be withdrawn from the Garrick
Theatre; but, on the other hand, she is very
pleased at being informed that one of her
favourite actresses, Mrs. BERNARD TREE (or
is it Mrs. TREEBOIIM BARE ?) is now so very
successively appearing as Charlotte Anne in
a new piece at the Haymarket.

TRUE HUMILITY.
Pi-osperous Briton. "An, WELL—GOOD-BYE! YOU MI'ST COME AND SEE

YOU KNOW."
Poor Relation (with grateful emphasis). "YES; ESPECIALLY rouxs,

TO A "DISTRICT" DIVINITY.
[XoTE.—Several of the trains on the District Railway are now fitted
with automatic electric reading lamps, which, upon a penny being
placed in the slot, supply a light for half an hour.]
0 GODDESS with the classic features pale,
And eyes of blue and hair of golden sheen,
Who dai'ly goest by the District Rail
From Charing Cross to distant Walham Green,
These lines—to tell the secret of my heart meant—
Are written in a second-class compartment!
For day by day as homeward both we speed
Each other we invariably face—
It seems as if we tacitly agreed
To each secure a " platform" corner place.
Our frequent meetings spring from Dest of reasons,
For we are technically known as " Seasons."
My fate thou art—my happiness or doom!
And oft, as vainly at thy beauty bright
1 'vc tried to peer through murkiness and gloom,
I 've cursed the Underground's pale, fitful light!—
The gas was not turned up to any ri'rirf end,
Except perhaps the prospects of a dividend.
But now my heart is filled with sweet content,
Since tiny boxes each compartment dot
For public use (and private profit) meant
Contingent on a penny in the slot.
O little box, dp you approve emphatically
The use to which 1 put you—automatically?
For as I drop the coin with gentle thud,
And press a knob with all my manly might,
The face of my divinity I flood
For thirty minutes with electric light!
Obliging box, I hope these verses indicate
The thanks I owe your enterprising syndicate!
These automatic tactics I 've pursued
With regularity for one short week;
But now that classic face is scarlet hued,
And she, whose marble lips declined to speak,
Has spoken out, and asked me " kindly not to";
And close acquaintanceship at last we 've got to!
PROVERBIAL PHILOSOPHY (for the O. If.'s next comedy).—
Manners make the man, but manors make the nobleman.
A "EIDEE" AND FOOT-NOTE TOLINDLEY MURRAY.
LK Vflu has recently consulted MM. ZOLA, GRKA.RD, and FHAN-
CISQVE SARCEY as to whether it is better to say idler a bicycletle, or
en bicyclette. These distinguished authorities nave decided that the
former phrase is correct. i'« tricycle, however, should be employed.
From a similar correspondence between the Secretary of the Scorchers'
Club and some eminent masters of the English language we extract
the following:— C'onistoii.
SIR,—You ask me which I prefer—" to ride a bicycle," or " to ride
on a bicycle." I reply emphatically, NEITHER. I am astounded at
your temerity in putting the question at all, since you must be
aware that I consider "cycling (as I believe it is termed) to be an
invention of the devil. Cse in their proper way the legs with which
Heaven has bhssed you, and eschew excursion-trains, balloons,
penny-omnibuses, dandy-horses, steam-launches, flying-machines,
and all other artificial aids to locomotion; or, if vou must be carried
from spot to spot, let the pack-horse, the sedan-chair, and the
waterman's wherry, be sufficient for your needs. J-N R-SK-N.
Dorking.
Mr. G-HGE M-D-TH very cognisantly presents his compliments to
the Secretary of the Scorchers' Club, and, as he is ever ready to fer-
tilise a brain-pan vacuum with a dot-running-epistolary-rostrum-
lecture, begs to state that a parley-phrase (or piece of word-patch-
work) lacks value, unless with rational yet crazy hocus-jugglery of
metaphors it cheat of its meaning the squab work-a-day gobble-
gobbets; 'wilder with tricky mingle-mangle of brumous trope the
fogged intellects of the pun-wheel trundle-trotter; and, duened
with lark-mirror of verbal leger-de-main, darkly-light and obscurely-
flashing, daze (for some drunken minutes) the rag-bag tag-and-hle
of the bird- wittcd body-public into hypnotic unthinking acquiescence.
He hopes that the Secretary (who is at liberty to make either head or
tail of the foregoing inse dixit) will—if he succeeds in reading or reding
it—nerve his admonished understanding to arrange accordingly.

Jones. But have we an acre of ground?
Robinson. Quite so—have we?
Brown. Well, of course we ought to have. Where the flag goes we

THE GILDED PILL.
Doctor. ' NOTHING is OUR EXPERIENCE, MADAM, is MORE MYSTERIOUS THAN THESE OBSCUBE NERVOUS COMPLAINTS, AND THE
SYMPTOMS THEY EXACTLY SIMULATE; AS, FOR EXAMPLE, IN A HIGHLY-STRUNG NEUROPATHIC CONSTITUTION LIKE YOUR OWN, WHERE
ALL THE PHENOMENA ACCOMPANYING—ER—OVER-EATING AKE EXHIBITED, AND WHICH, ABSURD AS IT MAY APPEAR, MUST BE TREATED
AS IP FOR THAT ACTUAL DISORDER!"
THE THEATRICAL CRITIC'S VADE MECUM.
Question. I see that a Sunday paper has recently told us how u
theatrical criticism comes to be written—can you point out the
way?
Aiisirei: Why, on paper, using only one side, and with the aid of
a pen or pencil.
Q. Naturally; but ought not the critic to master his author before
he commences his review?
A. Certainly. For instance, if the critic has to criticise a drama
of SAHDOU, he should make himself thoroughly acquainted with
all the works of that talented author.
Q. Is it necessary to see the new piece more than once?
A. If the critic adopts one course open to him, it would certainly
be advisable.
Q. Why would it be advisable?
A. Because, unless the critic sees a new piece sereral times, he
cannot thoroughly adjudicate upon the merits or demerits of the
acting.
Q. Then a theatrical critic should see a new piece several times
before he writes about it?
A. Such a course is to be recommended, the more especially as
after the sixth visit he should be able to understand the play'jwiJ
play thoroughly.
Q. And presumably he would have time to examine authori-
ties?
A. Quite so. That too is a matter that should not, be overlooked.
Three or four days can be spent in the Reading-room of the British
Museum in this connection most usefully.
Q. And no doubt the theatrical critic should have ample time to
compose a well-considered essay P
A. He should. To follow precedents set by the reviewers of the
past, he should have at least a fortnight to digest his opinions and
to polish his sentences.
Q. I think you said that this is one method of writing a theatrical
criticism, and you hinted there was another?
A. I did • because although presumably theatrical critics prefer
the first mode, they often are forced to adopt the alternative.
Q. What is the alternative method?
A. To form an opinion in the auditorium, to digest it in the
lobby, and to write the notice on the road to the office in the cab.
Q. And which method is the more popular with the public?
A. The latter, because the public wants its reviews with its
breakfast-rolls.
Q. And which are the more valuable, the notices or the rolls?
A. It is impossible to say; the public pays its money, and takes
its choice.
Crooked Chivalry.
[" The chivalrous instinct seems, in truth, to have been little mgre than
a caste sentiment."—Observer.]
BUBKE mourned over Chivalry dead,
But the Knight of old days was but dark.
To a man with no crest on his head
He 'd be insolent, cruel, and stark.
He couldn't see straight, poor old Knight!
His "Chivalry" squinted, and why:'
He was purblind too poor human Right
Because of the " Caste" in his eye.
MHS. R. says her nephew has struck up a great friendship with a
very rich young ladv; but when she asked his intentions, the foolish
fellow said it was only a " Plutonic friendship."

PREHISTORIC PEEPS.
A VISIT TO AN ARTIST'S STUDIO.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
"THB Prophet John, by FREDERICK BOYLE, suits me!" quoth
the Baron, cheerily. Messrs. CHAPMAN AND HALL bring out a capital
sensational story in one natty, easily-handled, easily-read volume.
"The time occupied," continues the Baron to his friends, "in
swallowing whole The Prophet John, as if you were the whale
taking in JONAH.—which sounds as if JONAH were a magazine in
parts,—is just what you can spare, if only you give your mind to
it, 'between the lights,' or, more properly speaking, within the
limit of the time that may intervene between entering your sanctum
and retiring to your sanctum snorum, yclept your bed. Should
you luxuriate, and by a coquetting and titillating process defer the
crisis, this ' thriller' may last you out two, or even three, evenings."
But having once taken it up, having once put your hand to it, and
your eyes on it, the Baron ventures to think that you will not part
with it in a hurry. It will be your " loss " if you " cut the Prophet,"
though with a paper-knife The Prophet must be cut, else you cannot
read it. Looking through Mrs. DAVENPORT ADAMS'S bulky but hand-
gome volume. The Poets' Praise, the Baron, like the Admiral in the
immortal ballad, " Werry much admiring wot she's done," begs to
suggest that in her next edition, whenever it may be called for,
Mr a. D. A., eminent collector as she is, should not omit from her
threnodies on the death of ALFRED Lord TENNYSON, the verses which
appeared in Mr. Punch's pages on that occasion, for these, the Baron
is certain, may triumphantly challenge comparison with any con-
temporaneous poetry on the same subject. Not alone is the Baron
in this opinion. Mrs. D. ADAMS should supply this want, when she
continues the collection " in her next."
BARON DE BOOK-WORMS.
OCR HIGHEST APPROVAL.—For the office of Chairman of the Con-
ciliation Board no better choice could have been made—Mr. Punch
always excepted, cela ra sans dire—than Lord SHAND. Of course,
he will be expected to drive about in a Shand-radan, drink
Shand-ygaff, and be well up in Tristram Shandy.
"YOUR HEALTH, MA'AM!"
THE sprightly Mrs. KEELEY (this deponent remembereth her as
the Sprite-ly too, a Queen of the Peris) runs the rare evergreen
Mr. G. pretty close. Mrs. KEELKY is in the eighty-eighth (or
eighty-ninth is it V) year of her exceptionally long dramatic run, and
she is still "going strong." There she was at the Lyceum last
j Thursday afternoon, so the D. T. reports, making a neat little
speech to the actors and actresses assembled, in the green-room after
I playing their parts in the pantomime of Cinderella, whose heroine
finds a perfectly charming representative in Miss ELLALINE TERRISS,
[the entertainment itself being, as "this deponent" is further
credibly informed, exceptionally good. Mrs. KEELEY returned
thanks for her health, which couldn't, it appears, be better, and
hoped that "present company" might be all exceptions as to
illnesses and infirmities when they everyone of them should reach
her time of life. The lively actress, who appears to have been
livelier than ever, was, it is reported, "in great spirits." She is
evidently preserved in the very best of spirits, and long may she so
continue.
Hint to a Literary Hotspur.
IN shallowness and prudery to grovel,
And with o'er-nice niaisertes stuff the Novel,
Good Mrs. GHUNDY'S countenance to keep,
Or please the pink Young Person chastely callow,
Is servitude befitting silly sheep.
Yet mud makes not profound the mental shallow,
And Art's high mission prurience will not hallow
By calling spirits from the Nasty Deep.'
MEM. FROM MANCHESTER.—Mr. BALFOUR was last week reported
! to have spoken at "a parochial tea-party." In future he will
i doubtless be known as a Tea-party Leader!

[FEBRUARY 3, 1894.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE IRREPRESSIBLE SHE.
(A Drama of the Day after To-mnrrow.)
SCENE 1.—Boudoir at Lady STOJTEYBROKE'S, JVb. 1574 (round the
corner], lielgrare Square, S. If.
Lady Stoneybroke (to Miss MEDUSA MINKS, Hypnotist and Faith-
healer). No, Miss Minks, I cannot truthfully say I am satisfied.
You know how absolutely necessary it is for me to get rid of my
insomnia and nervous breakdown if I am to cope with all the
difficulties and embarrassments that surround me. Yet you have
never once succeeded in fretting me into a trance state, and,
although 1 've believed in you as I never thought I was capable of
believing in anything, I'm not a bit better! Now how do you
account for it?
Miss Medusa. In the simplest way in the world, dear lady. I
don't believe I could send a dormouse to sleep for five minutes, and,
as for faith-healing—well, it would take a greater simpleton than
your ladyship to be any the better for believing in me 1
Lady S. Then do you mean that
you have come here on false pre-
tences?
Miss M. I do, but from the best of
motives. The fact is, I am con-
tributing a series of rncy and realistic
articles on "The Childish Credulity
of*our Upper Classes" to a leading
daily. I resolved to personate a Faith-
healer and Hypnotist, and turn my
experiences to journalistic account. I
acquired the necessary qualifications
for the part by the simple process
of paying two visits to a conjuror, and
practising the mesmeric art on any cat
I could induce to spare me a few
minutes. Then I came here and
offered my sen-ices. I am deeply in-
debted to you for affording material
which is calculated to throw a startling
light upon the mental crookedness of
a decadent and neurotic type of well-
bred womanhood.
Lady S. (faintly). But—but surely
you won't publish everything I told
you in confidence!
Miss M. Don't be alarmed. It will
appear under an altered name.
Lady S. But suppose people guess
who it is.'
Miss M. I can't be answerable for
other people. Mv only object is to
prove to my sex that faith-healing is
a light ana remunerative occupation,
likely to suit a young woman with
plenty of self-confidence and a fund
of quiet humour. I need not assure
you that to you personally I bear no
malice whatever, and if mv revela-
tions incidentally injure YOU, I shall be
the first to regret it. "Still duty it
duty, and I must perform mine, in the
interests of the public and the paper I
represent! Under the circumstances, "I shall give myself the pleasure
however, I am willing to waive the
question of fees for this particular visit, and will wish you good
afternoon.
[She goes out, learino Lady STOXEYBBOKE in acute discomfort.
Lady S. (to herself). What a terrible young woman! I do trust
she won't make her disclosures too recognisable! And I shall have
(o find another cure now! Insolvency is dreadful enough, but with
insomnia too! (To the New Oovernets, who enters.) Oh, Miss
FLIMSET, I was most unfavourably impressed by your French
accemt to-day at lunch. I thought you told me you were almost a
Parisian!
Mitt F.imsey (tcith spirit). I took half a dozen lessons on purpose
to come here. I really don't know what more you require!
Lady S. We won't discuss the question, but I must ask you to
make other arrangements at the end of the month.
Miss F. They are already made. I was about to inform you, dear
Lady STONEYBROKE, that the purpose for which I entered your
household is now happily accomplished. I don't know whether you
have seen a series of fivelv and popular sketches which are coming
out in The Perfect Lady just now, entitled "My Pupils and their
Dear Mammas. By an Amateur Governess." /am the Amateur
Governess, and you may like to know that a character sketch— quite
one of the most telling things I have ever done—of your daughter
DOROTHY, with a description of her proceedings in the sulks, and
her views on your treatment of children, will appear in next
week's number. I shall give myself the pleasure of forwarding you
an early copy.
Lady S. (gasping). Upon my word! And you propose to mention
my daughter and me by name?
Miss F. Well, I have thought very carefully over that, and, on
the whole, I have decided that, while it is the duty of a journalist
to suppress no facts that are material, there may be occasions when
she is justified in using her discretion. You have treated me fairly
well during my stav here, although I cannot but think that a
governess has a moral and inalienable right to breakfast in bed and
receive her male friends in the drawing-room at«//hours. However,
I shall not go bevond initials in your case. I am leaving at once; so
perhaps, while I am getting my things together, you will kindly
write me a cheque tor my month's salary, to which I need not
remind you 1 am legally entitled. [She goes out.
Lady S. (wringing her hands). A cheque, with my balance over-
drawn as it is, oh dear, oh dear! n hat a mercy my dear boy
HARTUPP is about to repair our
shattered fortunes by an alliance with
a lovely and incredibly wealthy Colonial
girl, who, according to him, is the
dearest and most delightful of her sex!
So nice and unexpected of the dear
fellow, for he never was mercenary!
Didn't he sav he was going to bring
her this afternoon to make my
acquaintance? Perhaps I had better
receive her in the big drawing-room.
I '11—yes, I '11 tell them to light a fire
there!
SCENE II.—The Big Draictng-
room. Later.
Miss Grade Gumtrey (taking her
leave, after haringbeen effusively wel-
comed as the future daughter-in-
law). I'm sure you're very kind,
Lady STOXEYDROKE; you almost moke
me feel as if I oughtn t to have come.
But I simply couldn't resist the chance
of this extra " copy."
Lady Stoneybroke and Hartupp
Stoneybroke. Extra copy! Of what?
Miss G. (modestIt/). Perhaps I should
have mentioned before that I am under
contract with a Colonial syndicate to
do a series entitled "How Patricians
Pop. By a Girl they Proposed to."
Your dear son is number eleven. I
shall complete the series—most pro-
bably—with the dozen.
Hartupp S. (crushed). And all this
time you have been merely trifling
with me!
Mist O. (with angelic siceelness).
Trifiing! JVo, HARTUPP, you cannot
do me the injustice to believe that I
should have encouraged you—as I
admit I did—except tor purely pro-
fessional purposes. It was necessary
of forwarding yon an early copy." to immolate you upon the altar of
Journalistic Enterprise, that is all,
and I think even you yourself will be struck by the spirit and
the absolute fidelity with' which I have reproduced the exact manner
and terms of your proposal. There was a deliriously fatuous inanity,
too, about some of your endearing epithets during our brief engage-
ment, which was ail your own, and is certain to make a hit and
boom the whole series. So it is not without gratitude that I ter-
minate an episode which, to myself at least, has been both pleasant
and profitable. Farewell! Do not forget me altogether!
[She goes out.
Lady S. My boy, my boy, try to bear this blow! Kettect. She
may not be an heiress after all!
Hartupp S. As if it was only her money! And yet, Mother, we
must get money, or else [He goes out.
Lady S. (to herself, gloomily). Or the STOXEYBROKBS will come to
a complete smash! Fortunately, I am in correspondence with the
daughter of a Chicago millionaire, a Miss CHLOE CHITTERLIKO, who
wants a chaperon to introduce her to the best society. I think I
could do it for five thousand pounds—and extras. 1 hate the idea,
but what can I do? (Re-enter Miss GUMTREY.) That dreadful
girl again! (To Miss GUMTREY, irith a reaction of hope.) Ah, you
do love HARTUPP after all, then!
Miss G. Love! We have no time for all that nonsense—except as

FIELD AND COVERT.
(First of February Reflections.)
FAREWELL, for a space, my gallant hammerless ejector! Farewell,
0 cartridge bag, seasoned by wind and rain! Farewell gaiters,
shooting boots, Knickerbocker breeches! The end of the season has
come, and I shall require you no more for the present. What a
season it has been! Grouse
plentiful, partridge abun-
dant, pheasants as strong and
tall as the heart of a mode-
rate shooter can desire, or
his uncertain aim attain to,
swarms of hares in defiance
of mournful prophecies
extinction given forth year
by year by those who see in
the Ground Game Act the
death of sport, and look upon
Sir WILLIAM HARCOURT,
who brought it in, as an iconoclast worse than any follower of JOHN
KNOX; here and there a glinting woodcock to give a spice of danger to
the day and till up the gaps in our shooting conversation; rabbits of
almost Australian plentifulness—this is the record on which I look
back as the evening's shadows close in on the First of February.
Did I shoot well? Hum, well—ask me another. Did I shoot
badly? No-o-o, I don't think I did; no, I'm certain I didn't.
Still, there was one awful day, when the pheasants seemed to come
merely to "cock (or hen) a snook" at me, and then sail away
unharmed into the distance in spite of my two despairing shots.
But of course I knew I shouldn't shoot well that day. I had slept
on a feather-bed, which is fatal to accurate shooting, and had eaten
devilled chicken for breakfast, which is equally fatal. Besides, I 'm
quite certain there was something wrong with my cartridges, and there
was a yelping retriever who got on my nerves. Curious, he didn't
get on DICK'S nerves, and DICK is as a rule more irritable than I am.
Perfect rot, DICK trying to make me believe he had filled his
cartridge-bag by mistake with my cartridges. He couldn't have
done that, because he shot extraordinarily well. Yet DICK was
never a gratuitous liar. Anyhow, I couldn't hit anything that day.
The miserable recollections, however, were almost wiped out two
days afterwards. Really flatter myself I held as straight as the
straightest that day, and was quite modest about it. DICK, who is
one of the glories of the Gun Club, didn't come off that day. Much
annoyed because I wiped his eye three times running at what he
called " impossible birds." He said it all came from sleeping on a
feather-bed, but I had slept on a feather-bed too. So it couldn't
have been that. But why, oh, why, are rabbits so hard to shoot P
They are small, of course, hut so is a partridge; and they go very
fast, but so does everything else, except a land-rail, and I 've seen a
slow old land-rail Hap the gauntlet of three Al shots without losing
so much as a tail-feather. "By gad," they explained, "that was
a rum 'un, but you can't expect to hit a thing that goes a yard an
hour when you've been shooting at flashes of lightning all day."
Of all created things rabbits in covert are the most perverse and
elusive. They don't want to be shot. Perhaps that's natural; but
then they 're no sportsmen, for they don't give you the ghost of a
chance of making ghosts of them. Yet LODER, my fritnd LODER,
doesn't seem to feel this. He sees a flash of white fur in the
thicket, and, while I 'm wondering whether I ought to fire, bang!
the rabbit's dead, and LODEB'S score is increased by one. The
beggar doesn't even trouble to put his gun to his shoulder always.
It'snot right.
Another day stands out in my memory, a day when al fie birds,
I moved by the diabolical impulse that sometimes afflicts them, would
i insist on going wrong. If we stood forward, with all proper regard
I for wind and every other circumstance, streams of feathered demons
kept whirring back where JOHNSON, the sporting solicitor, missed
them with a genial regularity that nothing could disturb. If we left
our best guns back, as we did eventually in desperation, JOHNSON, who
j was placed forward, again stood under a canopy of pheasants, and
shot, with brilliant success, into the gaps. The host was furious,
the keeper was in sombre despair, the good shots were depressed,
only JOHNSON was jubilant. On such occasions the only theory
which is accepted as explaining the catastrophe is one that imputes
a malignant cunning to the birds. This is the kind of conversation
you wifl hear.
Host (at the end of the beat). Done again, by the living Jingo!
Did you ever see such infernal birds? I 've shot this wood on the
same plan for five years and I 've never known the birds to go that
way. It's perfectly sickening.
The Keeper. Ah, they've fairly heat us this time, Sir. Pity you
didn't leave the two Captains back as I asked you. They 'd 'ave 'ad
firgt-rate shootin'.
A Gun. Oh, it's no good calculating on these pheasants doing
anything for certain. Do you think they don't know what we want
them to do? Of course tney do, and they jolly well make up their
minds to best us. They 're just as blessed cunning as they make 'em.
Nothing beats an old cock-pheasant for cunning. Why, when I
was shooting with JACK BAILEY the other day, we only got twenty-
five out of nis best wood, where we ought to have got about 150
(and so on, icith the usual reminiscence of a sporting disappoint-
ment).
Host. You 're quite right. Pheasants are the knowingest brutes
that ever flew.
You have only got to substitute grouse or partridge for pheasants,
and you have in the above dialogue a formula that will fit every case.
And so farewell till next season, ye guns, cartridges, shooting-
lunches, muffed birds, lost birds, winged birds, eager dogs, liable to
your masters' anger, ye beaters, hot in pursuit of the innocent
bunny, ye keepers, men of sterling quality both in skill and in the
tips we offer you, farewell, a brief farewell to all of you. Heaven
prosper all good shooters in the interval.
TO PYERHA.
WHAT if I send you trinkets, flowers, and gloves;
GHUNDY herself must grant we 've known eacli other

While lavishly my floral gifts you

doesn't matter."
Those little hands were never made to
spurn
The floral symphonies from Covent
Garden,
The dainty gloves that fit them to a
turn,
And plead the unromantic donor's
pardon.
E'en when the small glove holds that
tiny hand
We truly may declare there's nothing in it;
Such loyal tribute all may understand—
But all would change if others should begin it.
With them indeed you 'd rightly look austere,
Chillingly check their offertory zealous;
Not that I deem I really am more dear,
Not that I claim the right of being jealous.
Yet if presumptuous posies offered be,
Howe'er their worth and beauty may commend them,
Remembering that thev do not come from me,
Turn like a pearl at bay, and rend the swine who send

them.

"AND now you know the secret of my life. Can you forgive
ra??"
And in an agony of tears, but not remorse, FREDERICK threw him-
self at the feet of Lady MAVD.
"But it is all so strange," replied the nobly-born maiden, dazed
and wandering; "so unnatural—so wrong!"
"No, not wrong," cried FREDERICK, rising to his feet; "not
wrong, darling. I acted from the
purest motives. My every word,
my every thought, my every deed,
were guided by conscience, and
conscience alone. I know that
there is a prejudice against the
profession. I know that bv mam-
my career would be condemned.
How little do the gentlemen of
England who sit at home at ease
know the danger of the official
detective."
"You have found a prettier
name for your calling than that
usually bestowed upon it," an-
swered the now weeping girl, not
without bitterness. I have heard
you, and such as you, described as
spies!"
"And why not?" cried FREDERICK, proudlv. "I am a spy, and
I glory in it. I claim to be the protector of the community. It is
through my efforts that the good and true live in safety. It is through
my efforts that crime meets its just reward. Without my intellect
to serve the cause of virtue, innocence would be vanquished and vice
triumphant."
She was evidently influenced by his splendid vindication of his (to
pnt it mildly) unpopular calling. Still she would not give in—at first.
"But was it right to betray your uncle?" she sobbed out. "And

do you call it kind to hand over vour grandmother to those who live
j in Scotland Yard?"
"And why not?" he answered. "Both of my misguided rela-
tions were guilty; the fact was proved up to the hilt at their trials.
| And if the fact of my blood-connection with them procured me
access to their private papers, surely you, as a good citizen, a regular
'ratepayer, ought to rejoice, not utter expressions of regret!"
She was still hesitating. Then she spoke.
"My dear," she murmured, "it is not because I do not love you
that I refrain from falling into your arms. I do love you, with all
my heart,"
'" My own!" cried FREDERICK, rushing towards her.
"No, stay and hear me out. I have suspected your profession
from the first; and I have been proud of your success. But, love, I
was obliged to be cold and distant, because I too was"
"Not another word!" he cried, taking her in his arms, and im-
printing a kiss upon her brow. "My darling; as the lawyers say, it
might be used at your trial."
"My trial!" she faltered.
"Nay, darling, look not at me with those piteous, pleading' eyes.
We both have our duty to perform, and we must perform it bravely.
You have guessed rightly. I have known your story from the first.
Yes, darling, while I was basking in the glorious summer of your
smile, while I was in an ecstacy at the sound of your silvery
voice, I was vet attending to business."
"And my letters?" she gasped out.
"Arc no longer in my possession. They have been sent to the
proper quarter. And now, darling, bear it bravely—bear it bravely,
for my sake."
"Oh, FREDERICK, FREDERICK. I cannot give you up!" she said,
passionately. "It is now doubly hard to lose you. Oh, my love,
oh, my love, you shall not go!"
"I must, darling." And, gently disengaging his hands, he blew
a whistle, and, with a heavy sigh, left his beautiful (but now
fainting) burden in the custody of the police.—THE F.xn.

EARLY ANNOUNCEMENT.—New
book in preparation for next Christ-
mas :—The Mince-Pie-rate. By
the Author of The Iron Pirate.
STRICTLY ACCORDING TO PRECEDENT.
(A Fragment from the coming Colonial History.)
THE Managing Director of the Universal Colonisation Company
was seated in his sanctum when the General and the Admiral
visited him.
"You have seen the news?" asked the soldier.
"And know the gravity of the situation?" queried the sailor.
"Certainly," returned the official. "The native forces on the
west coast of Undiscoveredia have mutinied."
"Yes," said the soldier; "and threaten every moment to invade
the colony. It is a serious crisis!"
"And propose to level to the ground all the European factories,"
put in the sailor. "The position is distinctly critical!"
"Not impossible," returned the Managing Director. "But how
can you help me, gentlemen?"
"By taking over an Army Corps—subject to the sanction of the
War Office," responded the General.
"By sailing away from England with a fleet—subject to the per-
mission of Whitehall," replied the Admiral.
"And how long would all this take?" asked the official.
"Well, I think I could get the fleet there in about six months,"
murmured the sailor, after considering the delays of commissioning
and other formalities.
"And I might manage my part of the business in something like
a year," suggested the soldier, who knew that there was a good deal
of red-tape in the cellars of Pall Mall.
"Well, gentlemen," exclaimed the Managing Director, "I must
thank you on behalf of my company for your Kind offer of assistance,
but I feel we cannot avail ourselves of your courtesy. We prefer to
do without you."
"Almost rude." muttered the soldier, as he made his exit.
"Scarcely civil," whispered the sailor, as he took his departure.
Then, when the two warriors had gone, the official spoke through
a speaking-tube.
Be good enough," he said to a clerk in attendance, "to telephone
to the coast, and request the District Manager to put the insurrec-
tion in the hands of the local police."
"Certainly, Sir," returned the clerk.
So the necessary message was sent, and the customary steps were
taken, and, as usual, the rising was put down by the strong hand of
the law.
And (also), as usual, this satisfactory result was attained without
the assistance of the Imperial power.
SARAH BUDDHA-INQ OUT AGAIN.—"The Divine SARA" has evi-
dently got something of everything, and something from everywhere,
in the new very tragical-poetical play •written for her by Messrs.
SYLVESTRE and MOHAND, entitled Izeyl. The gaiety, levity, passion,
wild love of the courtesan and the inspired devotion of the fanatic,
physical suffering, torture, rage, madness, despair, stabbing, going
blind, a thrilling death-scene, and a saintly angebc apotheosis, go
far to exhaust the possibilities of any drama, past, present, or to
come, and do not leave many crumbs of dramatic comfort for the
lesser talents, be they actors or authors. Quite in her old form
again, or rather young form again, is SABA B.!
"INHARMONIOUS."—A highly-wrought poet observes that, being
impressed with the "eternal fitness of things" generally, he
actually shudders at the mere idea of having to eat an Under-
ground Artichoke when travelling by The Overland Route.

(Signs of the " Times.")
DEAR SIR,—Will you allow
me to give some reasons why
cycles should be taxed? The
proposal I know is old, but
I venture to think that the
reasons now advanced will
hardly be open to the same
objection.
1. By reducing the num-
ber of cycles it would (like
the Employers' Liability Bill)
tend to diminish the loss of
human life and limb. Babies
are frequently brushed off the
spokes after long rides (see
published works of Mr.
BARRY PAIN).
2. It would enormously in-
crease the number of cycles
used, and thus incidentally
send all the unemployed to
Coventry to make them.
What a man pays for that
he appreciates. He who is
by nature cold to cycles
would buy one if taxed.
3. All allusions to cvcles
in popular songs would be
taxed. This would act re-
trospectively. The amount
obtained from '' A Bicyrle
made for Ttco " would in all
probability be enough to buy
enough ships for a hundred
years to come.
I am aware that reasons 1
and 2 apparently conflict, but
it is the mark of a really
great cause that it should be
supported for absolutely op-
posite reasons. I commend
my scheme to a perplexed
Chancellor.
Yours contentedly,
NOT A WHEEL-MADE MAN.
P.S. Of course the tax
would include the " cycle of
Cathay."
DEAB MR. PUNCH,—It's
time for those who don't
want to be swept away by
the incoming tide of Democ-
- racy to assert themselves.
Some shout themselves hoarse for a Free Breakfast Table; why not
a Free Dinner Table? It's clearly much the more statesmanlike
proposal of the two. There are millions who don't care a rap for
breakfast, but where is there a man or woman who is content not to
dine? 1 don't know what we have for dinner that's taxed (I never
could do political economy) except champagne and cigars. But
what more need be said? To eat is human, to drink wine divine.
I leave the matter there. At any rate it can't be »aid I 've neglected
my duty. ONE WHO TREATS DLNNER AS A MATTER OF COURSES.
DEAR SIR,—I see the CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER has to raise
;i lot of money. I have a suggestion. And really in these unimagin-
ative times I consider it a most brilliant one. It occurred to me sud-
denly, and as suddenly I ceased to remember it. And this statement
of facts has temporarily driven the notion from my head. What was
_ ^c „„„„„„, it? Ah, I have it! We are all nothing if not forgetful, and
"What! tell Still-room secrets-^? No, no, no.'" \ my proposal is that, as often as we forget anything we should-

SIR (or "Madam."—as the

answer to this inquiry, for the
time being, is that the present
representative of Si/lria is
Miss OLGA NETTIESSOLE, and
that she is to be seen at the

in an indifferent piece entitled
The Transgressor. Certainly
of this clever actress it may be
predicted " elle ira loin" and,
if not going too far, would she
not fittingly impersonate
Madame Mephistopheles?
There was recently such a
piece in Paris entitled Madame
Mefisto, and for the leading
part in this who could be found
apparently, or at least nomin-
ally, better suited to such a
part than a Miss Spirit Below,

DIARY OF A PARTIALLY-EXTINGUISHED PERSONAGE.
Monday.—Greatly annoyed at finding the sentry in front of my
Palace taking shade in the sentry-box, instead of marching in the
sun. Ordered him out. He refused to go. Found a.sergeant, and
ordered him under arrest. Sergeant inquired into the matter, and
said " that the man did not know I was an officer." This in spite
of my diamond-covered fez and emerald and ruby overcoat! Told
the sergeant I considered the English soldiers a disgrace to the
Egyptian army. Sergeant saluted and replied, "All right, Sir, I will
report your remark to my captain." Did not continue the con-
versation, as one of my Ministers came to inform me that my lunch
of rahat lakourn and real Persian sherbet was wailing for me. But a
day will come, and when it does, "Down with the English!"
Tuesday.—Went out in a steam-launch, and boarded a British
man-of-war. Asked to see the Admiral. Midshipman replied that
he thought the Admiral was away, but " that no doubt he would do
as well." Told Midshipman that I considered the English fleet a
disgrace to civilisation. Pointed out that the officers did not know
the proper colour for their ships. Fancy painting them white, when
they might have selected green, with yellow spots and pink stripes!
Midshipman "begged to disagree with me." Ordered him to put
himself under arrest. Midshipman said "he would obey my
instructions when he had time to attend to them, but just then he
was busy." Returned to my launch in a fury, and only regained my
usual equanimity after taking a ride in my new electric self-guiding
perambalator.
Wednesday.—Looked in at the Railway Station, and insisted upon
seeing the Chairman of Directors. Porter told me " that he was not
there, but might be expected in the course of a month or so." Dis-
graceful! Found out the station-master, and insisted that steam-
power was a mistake. Ordered the official to take out all the engines,
and supply horses in their stead. Station-master civil, but unsatis-
factory. He said he " would do anything to oblige me, but just then
he had to catch a train. He would think the matter over on his
return." Desired him to keep himself in solitary confinement in
the Lost-luggage Department. Station-master said, "All right,
VOL, CTI,
Sir;" and, entering a first-class carriage, steamed away. Imper-
tinent! How long must I suffer these outrages! However, was
mollified on learning that a consignment of tin-soldiers from Vienna
has just reached my nursery.
Thursday.—Took a walk. Met a tourist, who only took off his hat
to me. Ordered him to fall upon his bended knees, and touch the
ground with his forehead. He refused. Told him to consider him-
self under arrest. He said that he should report the matter to his
Consul. Begged him to forgive me, and told him I would never be
a naughty boy again. My tears moved him, and he (rave me some
money for sweetstuff. On his departure, called a Cabinet Council,
and insisted that Egypt should declare war against Europe. The
Ministry then retired to consider the situation.
Friday.—A. terrible day! The soldier, the midshipman, the
station-master, and the tourist have all lodged complaints. Called
my Ministry together, but they refused to come. They said they
were still considering the situation. Appealed to my head nurse,
but. she sided with my enemies, and sent me to bed! A nice way to
treat one of the greatest of contemporary princes! However, did
not like to offend her, as she has been with me since I was a child.
So thought the matter over under the counterpane.
Saturday.—I must have been born under an unlucky star! In
spite of my promises of amendment I am to be further punished!
What they will do to me I can't imagine! But Lord CROMER is
such a very severe man! I do so hope he won't send me back to
school. My only consolation is that, if he does, my dear old nurse
will be sure to" forward a hamper! I am very wretched! I can't
read. I can't write. I can't eat—no, not even lollipops! I can only
murmur " Kismet." It is a familiar sound, but, under the circum-
stances, not very comforting! Kismet!
Ad Astorem.
So they 've hoaxed you again! We shall know you, my master,
Henceforth as the great journalistic dis-Astor.
And, if curses avail, you '11 get nothing but dust
For the millions you spend, since your editor's CrsT.

ROSAMOND AND THE WANDERJAHR.
A MORAL TALE.
(By Mariti Edgcworth Kedirim.)
"MAMMA," said ROSAMOND one day, when she was turned twenty,
and'very busy in reading a clever article in one of the monthly-
reviews, "don't you erer thirst to taste the joys of life'?"
"AVhich of them, ROSAMOND?" (For her mother was just the
same imperturbably wise and Socratio parent as in the old days of
The Purple Jar and The 'Two Plums.)
"Which? I don't know which; any of them will do, for they
are all thrilling."
"Yes. they are all thrilling, but of what use would thrills be
to me ? '*'
"Use! Oh, I'm sure you could find some use or other if you
would only try first."
"But I would rather find out the use first."
ROSAMOND was very sorry that her mother was so unresponsive.
Presently, however, she came to a part of the
article which appeared to her more beautiful
than the rest. It was not intended to be taken
quite seriously, but she did not know that.
Oh, Mamma, oh!" cried she, touching her
mother's arm: "listen! listen! what lovely
sentiments! Why not allow the possibility
that nice girls—well-disposed girls—may also
desire a mild sort of Wanderjahre period, dur-
ing which they, too want, not to break fences,
but to get occasional glimpses of the landscape
beyond,the family domain.'"
Kay. my dear; why not indeed?"
"Oh, Mamma, but only hear this. 'The far-
seeing mother will consent to sit a quiet and
smiling spectator when her daughter ventures
on small, or even comparatively big, social ex-
periments.'"
'' That, ROSAMOND, is the system which I have
consistently pursued with vou from infancy."
"Then, won't you let me nave a mild Wander*
jahrj Mamma?
Still her mother answered as before. "Of
what use would it be to you, ROSAMOND r"
"I might 'trv things on my own account,'
Mamma. I could ' make my own minor mis-
takes,' and—and 'do my little bit of the
world's work," you know!"
"You have your little bit to do at home,"
said her mother. "And wandering is not
working."
"But I could use it for working. Mamma,
you know. I want to see what Me is really
tke!"
"Perhaps, if you were to see it nearer, you
might be disappointed."
No, indeed, I 'in sure I should not. I should
like it exceedingly."
ROSAMOND'S head was so turned by the idea
of having a Wanderjahr. like her brothers,
ORLANDO and GODFREY, that she could think
of nothing else. "Then, Mamma," said she,
after a pause, "perhaps vou cant afford to
give me a portion to enable me to make my
experiment f"
Yes, I can. But what would you do with
your Wanderjahr when you got it f"
"What would I do, Mamma? Let me see. Oh, I would have a
larger liberty—I would be an individual as well as a daughter. I
would study for a profession, or a business, like other girls. Some
of them succeed, quite as well as men."

ROSAMOND, are vou quite sure that you have the energy and ability
to succeed, or that you feel a distinct vocation to any particular
profession or business '("
"Well, I can't tell till I have trieJ, you know, Mamma; and I
may have to try several before I decide. But at least I shall be ablo
to live in lodgings alone, and have a latchkey, and go to music-halls
by myself, and know people who are not' properly introduced' and
'accredited.'"
"I thought, ROSAMOND, you were so anxious to see more of those
nice Miss FAIRCHILDS, who have come to live near us ?. And there
was that Mr. FRANK PINCENEY, who is so clever and getting on
so well at the Bar, and HAHKY SANDFORD, who is doing so much
work among the poorer classes; were you not desirous that I should
ask them to dine with us?"
"Why, yes, Mamma, if you would be so very good. I should like
to know them very much. I think o>ir tastes would be. very
much the same, and you know they would really be agreeable
acquaintances!"
"Perhaps they might, but you cannot be sure till you have
tried any more than you can be quite sure that you should like the
Wnnderjahr exceedingly,"
"Why, I don't know about the acquaintanceship, certainly,
till 1 've tried, but, Mamma, I am quite sure that I should like the
Wanderjahr."
"Well, which would you rather have—the Wanderjahr, or the
friendship of the FAIRCHILDS and the acquaintanceship of Mr.
PINCENEY and Mr. SANDFORD and their circle? You shall have
either."
"Dear Mamma, thank you; but, may I not have both f"
"No, not both."
"Then, the Wanderjahr, if you please."
"But I should tell you that, in that case, I cannot promise you
that vou would enjoy any intimacy with the FAIRCHILD family, nor
would Mr. PINCENEY or Mr. SANDFOBD care to cultivate the
acquaintance of a young girl who lives alone,
without necessity, and apparently finds her
highest ideal of enjoyment in visiting a music-
hall."
"But indeed I don't, Mamma. It is only
because most young men go to such places,
and why should they object to our doing the
same';"
"Perhaps for that very reason, my dear."
"That's a very bad reason indeed! But I
believe I 'd better go on in the old conventional
groove. Yet—that mild Wanderjahr! Oh,
indeed, Mamma, I 'have no unwholesome
hankering for forbidden fruit.' The year
would soon be over, and then I can come back
and be conventional again, can't I? Don't
you think so, Mamma?"
"Nay, my dear. I want you to think for
yourself. You will have time enough to con-
sider the matter whilst I write to.the Times
about ' Why Young Men don't Marry.'"
Whilst her mother was composing her letter,
ROSAMOND stood in profound meditation, with
Mr. PINCENEY'S and Mr. SANDFORD'S and Mrs.
and the Miss FAIRCHILDS' visiting cards in one
hand, and the Nineteenth Century in the other.
"Well, my dear, have you decided'("
"Mamma! Yes, I behove 1 have. If vou
please, I should like to have the Wanderjahr;
that is, if you won't think me very silly,
Mamma."
"Why, as to that, I can't promise you,
ROSAMOND; I may have my suspicions that
you are making this choice, not so much be-
cause you feel any overpowering vocation, as
because you fancy it is going to be the fashion-
able thing to do. But when you judge for
yourself, you should choose what will make
you happy, and then it will not signify who
thinks you silly."
"Then, Mamma, if that's all, I 'm sure the
Wanderjahr would make me happy, so I
choose the Wanderjahr."
"Very well; you shall have it." ROSA-
MOND felt much pleasure upon hearing her
mother announce that she had placed an ample
sum at her disposal, and that she was at liberty
to take lodgings in any part of the town she pleased (ROSAMOND
thought she would like' to live near Regent's Park, or somewhere
about Chelsea), spend her time in future exactlv as she chose, go
everywhere alone, stay out as late as she considered necessary, receive
"No doubt—when they are exceptionally robust. But tell me, anv acquaintances—male or female—who should seem to her worth

studying, and generally enjoy rather more privileges, and be more
free from supervision than the majority of young men of her age.
"I shall be very happv during my If anderjahr. Mamma," she said.
"I hope so, my dear/'
«'» » » • •
Was ROSAMOND very happy? Was her Wanderjahr a greater
success than the famous Purple Jar of many years ago? Some say,
yes-bothers, no; and, indeed, opinions differ so widely on the
subject that perhaps it is better to allow each reader to till in the
sequel and apply the moral, according to his or her private intuition.
Mr. Punch knows what his opinion is—but he doesn't intend to tell.

READING BETWEEN THE LINES."
A BIARRITZ DIARY.
Monday,—Basque language highly remarkable. Must get Basque
Grammar and Dictionary, and make real study of the subject. Just
the thing for a holiday!
Tuesday.—Have done so. Basque gets more remarkable the
farther I get into it. Rather like mixture of Gaelic and Russian,
with slight fiavour of Double Dutch. Take my vocabulary to shore,
and try some sentences on fishermen. Fishermen pretend not to
understand. Query—can they he Obstructionists't If so, how can I
closure them'( As it is, they closure me by walking away. Tele-
gram from H-RC-HT, about Budget. Says "Thought of deficit gives
him sleepless nights." What he wants is change of scene and occu-
pation. Wire back to him to come to Biarritz, and study Basque.
If that doesn't send him to sleep, nothing will.
Wednesday.—What's the good of being near Spain if you don't
see a bull-fight? I have, at St. Sebastian. Authorities there most
polite—gave me a front seat. Slipped out during the performance
and got the "Toreador" (think that's what he's called) to let me
take his place for a time. Did so. A little practice would, I feel
sure, make me an accomplished bull-fighter. As it was, not quite
perfect in throwing the cloak over bull's horns as he charged. Only
a timely remembrance of my tactics with the cow in Hawarden Park
prevented my being tossed. Prefect, when he knew it was me.
interfered to prevent my "exposing myself to needless risks."
;j
Stupid of Prefect, just as I was getting into it, too! Back to
Biarritz. Tired, but cheerful. Telegram from R-S-B-KT; wants to
know what he's to do with KHEDIVE. Obvious answer—send him
here, to learn Basque. That '11 sober him!
Thursday.—Deputation of Basques waits on me. Gratifying, as
it enables me to practise the language on them. Give them an
hour's speech, explaining Home-Rule Bill. Very attentive. Find
at end that they think I've been addressing them on Pyrencan
agriculture! Disappointing. Tell them about Welsh Disestablish-
ment. A Priest in audience assures me "Basques devoted to their
Church, and won't like the subject." Curious superstitions still rife
among this ancient people! However, manage to give them a com-
prehensive lecture on their own history, politics, system of education,
and so on, which seems to surprise them.
Friday,—Off to Roncesyalles, where ROLAND fell. Imagine
myself knight of old, fighting Paynim hosts. Why "Paynini:"'
Must look this up. Or telegraph to BKYCE to explain—he knows this
sort of thinif. Might pain 'im, however, to bother him in the
holidays. Air must be very good here—never could joke like that in
Downing Street. Borrow some old armour, and dress up in it. Ix>cal
Gendarme interferes. This coercion unpleasant. Back to Biarritz.
Hear Lords have dished my Bills. Don't care! Jollv evening for a
bathe. Had one. More Basque vocabulary after. Bed.
Saturday.—Family say I am over-
doing it! They 've hidden my Basque
dictionary! What tyranny! Must do
something to-day. Hear they still
make swords at Bilbao. Off to see.
Nice Prefect, charming "SeBoritas,"
but no swords! Yes, one—with a Bir-
mingham stamp on it! Depressed—
reminds me so of J-S-PH. Back, and
console mvself with three hours over
Basque, then a few chapters of my
"History of Light - houses," my
"Theory of Marine Fishing," and my
"Hints to Vine-growers," all of which I've begun since I came
here. Wires from R-S-B-RY, H-RC-RT, R-P-N, SP-NS-R, M-RL-Y,
and the rest asking "if it's true that I intend to resign?" Why
not? Then I could settle down here, master the eighteen Basque
dialects, and that bull that nearly finished me. But,—as the old song
has it, "Take me while I 'in in the humour,—not just now!"
PROPHECY OR PREVENTION.
IF you chance to make a statement, that's untrue,
And the party most concerned declares it is so;
The papers of another party true
Will chuckle at your queer canard, and quiz so.
But bless you, if you know what you 're about,
You '11 discover many ways to turn the tables.
Denial always dues engender doubt,
And prophesies—postponed—are not mere fables.
To-morrow, or next week, or e'en next year,
The future tense impartially applies to.
You may put constructions on such words as "near"
That COCKEK cannot count although he tries to:
And then—and this is really awful fun!—
It will prove you most ingenious, and knowing, too!
Just what you said the party would have done,
If you hadn't told the world that he was going to!

Canards.
MRS. 11. saw a paragraph in some newspaper a few days ago,
headed "Apprehension of Mr. JABEZ BALFOUH." She is not at all
surprised at this. Naturally he must be feeling nervous.

HISTORY DEFEATS ITSELF.
["You are not like Cerberus, three gentlemen at once, are you?"
Mus. MALAPROP.]
THE Daily News informed us on the 26th ult., as did the Daily
Telegraph a few days earlier, that the body of RICHARD THE THIRD
was conveyed after the battle of Bosworth to Rothley Temple. A
correspondent, writing to the latter paper, has, however, pointed out
the perplexing fact that there is a tablet on the bridge now replac-
ing the old " Bow Bridge" at Leicester, which states that the King's
body was thrown over into the river. Sundry historians assert that
his remains were buried in the Grey Friars' church at Leicester;
while a tradition adds that his stone coffin afterwards became a
drinking-trough.
Certainly, our historians do not seem to be quite what is at the
present day commonly called " up to Dick " ; and we confess at once
our own inability to reconcile the opposing reports. Unless the
really dead RICHARD CROOKBACK had almost as many adventures as
the apparently dead little hunchback of Arabian Nights fame, it
looks rather like RICHARD being himself again, ana again!—in
fact, not merely double GLOSTER, but triple ditto. Perhaps
ARTEMUS WARD is your true historian when he speaks of " RICHUBD
THE THREE,"-^or it may be that the unlucky monarch, thinking he
had not had fair play when in life, mode a naif successful attempt
afterwards to get even with " six RICHMONDS in the field."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE HAYMARKET MYSTERY!
THE ways of managers arc inscrutable. The other day Mr. HAKE
accepted, presumably therefore approved of, and emphasixed his
approval by producing, and playing the leading part in, a play by
Mr. SYDNEY GRUNDY entitled An Old Jeir, which will now become
another " Wandering Jew," since it is highly probable that he will
vainly seek rest for the sole of his foot on the boards of provincial,
American or Colonial theatres. And here is Mr. BEERBOKM TREE
approving, accepting, producing, and himself performing the title
role in The Charlatan a sort of mesmeric-and-spiritualistic play,
which nothing but the prestige, the earnestness, and the excellent
acting of the principals could have possibly induced the public to

Professor Charlatan. "Observe there is no deception! Nothing up my
sleeve!"
accept. No act of prestidigitation which that most skilful conjuror
Mr. BEERDOHM TREE may perform can equal this one great trick of
"palming " this play off on the public as a finished work either of
dramatic art or of literary excellence.
The idea seems to be a muddle, too, for The Charlatan discovers
that he really is what he has been pretending to be; and then, in
spite of the evidence of facts which contradict him flatly, he confesses
that he is not what he has discovered he really is! Why, 'tis a
plot that Lord Dundreary might have conceived, or that The Head-
less Man, had he turned his mighty intellect towards the Drama,
might have concocted! If Philip H'oodrille be a Mesmeriser and
Spiritualist, as he professes to be, then is he not a Charlatan. If
Philip Jf'oodrille be only half of this, a Mesmeriser and not a
Spiritualistic Medium, then he is only half a Charlatan; but at the
same time, if undeniable facts have proved to him, in spite of him-
self, that he does possess just half of those very powers Tie has been
pretending to wield, would he not at once reason to himself that,
for aught he knew,he might indeed be able to " call spirits from the
vasty deep," if he only gave his mind to it? No; it seems that the
sanguine dramatist had got hold of just one situation and a couple
of characters; and then in answer to his own question, " What shall
I do with them ?" he tits up a skimpy sort of frame-work, which
will hardly hold together, for '' the picture of ' We Three,'" the three
being Philip the Charlatan, Madame Obnoskin (ye Gods, what a
name!), and Isabel Arlington.
Poor Madame Ob-no-skm! She is substantially represented in
the flesh by Miss GERTRUDE KINGSTON, who plays the difficult part
with considerable power; and it is not her fault if the part is not
better, and if it does not otter those chances which, had the plot
been well thought out and thoroughly developed, such a part ought,
to have afforded her. As it is, poor Madamf Ob-all-_fiv>ih-and-iit>-
akiii, who has very little to do worth doing, and still less to say worth
hearing, is a sort of female Cook in a firm of Real Spiritualistic
Conjurors, Masculine and Cook, the senior partner in the firm being
represented by Mr. BKKKBOHM TREE, who, true to the MAKKELYNE
mission, finally conies out as an exposer of spiritualist ic frauds. But
how about the"female confidante r1 What is she besides this't What
have been the relations between these two r1 Is she jealous of him?
Was it she who came "tapping" like the Raven at the door of the
Charlatan's "Turret-Room" when Isabel Arlington, having
walked thither iu her sleep, had to walk off again, uncommonly wide
awake r1 It may have been: but she didn't say so: at least, as
Iloratiu says of the (rhost, "Not when I saw it."
Mrs. TREE as Ophelia, after-
wards Lady Macbeth, and finally
La Sonnanibii/a, or The Sleeper
Awakened, three single ladies
(Lady Macbeth wasn't single, by
the way, but "this is a detail )
rolled into one, is really admirable.
One false step when asleep, one
false note (and she sings with ex-
quisite pathos) would have upset
the entire piece. Mr. ROBERT
BUCHANAN owes her more, perhaps,
than he does to Mr. TREE for the
success of the piece; for indubitably
the success of The Charlatan is
mainly due to these two.
Mr. KERR is as good as the part
will permit him to be, find so is
Miss LILY HANBURY. Mr. CHAKLES
ALLAN is a much-married Dean to
the life ; and if Mr. HOLMAN CLARK
did not just in one instance (where
he surveys the Dean literally up
and down, and only arrives at the
conclusion that the subject of his
inspection is an Anglican clergyman
on seeing his knee-breeches) overdo
the part of Professor Mumbles, he
would be perfect.
As the Author makes Lord Deirs-
bery more a cad than a gentle-
man, it would be hard to blame
the actor for not making the char-
acter more gentlemanly than the
Author intended him to be; still,
Mr. FRED. TERRY might have con-
trived to soften down the crude
lines of Mr. BUCHANAN'S "fancy portrait" of a young gentleman
"all of the modern time," and thereby he would have improved on
the original considerably.
All told, this "new plau of modern life" as Mr. BUCHANAN
describes it (" Modern Life" of the time of WILKIE COLLINS's Moon-
stone and of Mr. HOME'S spiritualism), will owe its success, as I
have said before, to the excellence of the acting as framed in most
artistically effective "sets" by Mr. W. HANN, one of which, The
White Gallery, a legitimate effect of painting and arrangement,
may be reckoned among the best "interiors" presented either here
or on any other stage. (Signed} THE B IN Box.

How the Dark Continent takes tithe and toll
Of Britons of stout heart and steadfast soul!
Venturing life to bear the quickening light,
Midway of manhood's day he met his night.
Afric's late dawn of which such deaths are herald,
Should glory-gild the tomb of good Sir GERALD!
IN AQUA VERITAS.—We read that it is becoming the custom to feed
Spanish Anarchist prisoners exclusively upon cod, while denying them
water. When brought into court, the accused find themselves close to
decanters that sparkle again, but the judges hasten to inform them
that the water within, and all other, will be withheld until they have
told the truth. This simple method of procedure, it is added, has
proved singularly successful. Evidently Spain, in spite of an appa-
rently retrograde movement to the times of the Inquisition, has
really made a great advance, and is to be congratulated upon her
fortune above other nations in not having to go so far as the bottom
of the well for truth, but only to the bottom of the decanter.

THE GENTLE ART OF ADVERTISING.
DEAR SIB,—I notice that the enterprising lady (of the "Irre-
pressible She" order) who, in cap and apron, deceived so many
servant-worried mistresses, has been turning her attention to fresh
fields and pastures new, and has purported to be a young American
heiress desirous of obtaining an entrance into that exclusive
preserve known as London Society, and necessarily desirous also of
securing some one to act as her introducer. One of the victims of
her copy-seeking endeavours was a (i.C., and it appears that my
learned and excellent friend (for I shrewdly suspect that I know
where to look for him) wrote that he was willing, for an adequate
consideration, to undertake (in conjunction with his wife) the task
of chaperoning (if the word applies to a mere man) the supposed
heiress. We now know that the whole thing was a heartless noax
—at a penny a line. The learned leader has oeen fooled by a chit
of a girl, and must look elsewhere for the guineas which are to
compensate him for the lack of briefs.
For it cannot be denied that, with the cleverest and bust of us,
briefs are uncommonly scarce, and we have to scheme and contrive
to any extent to get those there actually are. There's a pleasant
fiction abroad, I believe, that at the Bar no one advertises. That is
correct by the card. You will not find in the columns set apart for
advertisements the announcements of Barristers between those of
Barmaids and Buttermen. No, but in the Correspondence Column
we write letters from our chambers on the vital questions of the day
—to keep our name before the public. I well remember a guinea
County Court brief (the fee for which, by the way, was never paid)
which I was able to trace directly to a most valuable letter I wrote
on " Ought Judges to sleep in Court for more than half an hour at a
time ? "— a subject to which I hope with your permission, at an early
opportunity, to recur in your columns.
Then, of course, our movements ore chronicled in the most com-
plete way. "Mr. L. EKNED COUNSEL and Mrs. ERNED COUNSEL
leave town for the South Coast this afternoon. Mr. COUNSEL has
several cases in the list on Monday, and returns to London that
morning." Some of it was quite true—my wife and I did go for the
"Week-End" (at specially low rates) to a boarding-house at East-
bourne. I am aware that to some this may seem ignoble, and
unworthy of a great profession. I hope, however, that I shall not be
mistaken. I have only token my own case to spare the blushes of
my comrades. The practice is as common as it is notorious. In
fact, if this were not (by your leave) to appear in the august columns
of Punch, I should be tempted to say. in conclusion, that the only
object _of this very letter was what I have admitted as ignoble—
advertisement. But, as it is, permit me to be,
Yours modestly, L. EKNED COUNSEL.

(The Wail of the Much-producing-Long-crowded-out Poet.)
WHERE is the verse I sent you months ago,
On various subjects, humorous and terse?
The weeks pass by in unremitting flow,
—Where is the verse?
Though long in type, they rest beneath your curse,
(A strongish word—the rhyme will have it so)
That which was topical grows flat, or worse,
That becomes stale, which once was comme ilfaut,
So heed the scribbler, impotent to nurse
His grief in silence, and who 'd like to know
Where is the verse?
As IT SHOULD BE.—Mr. Punch is much gratified to find his
advice taken, and that the case of Koster v. Empire Palace, Limited,
was tried lost week before Mr. Justice 'AWKINS, in accordance with
Mr. Punch's suggestion three weeks ago.

THE NEXT INTERVIEW.
SCENE—Friedrichiruh. TIME—.4 month hence.
PBESENT—EMPEBOR and PRINCE.
Prince. Well, your Majesty, now that we are together I mutt
again express the delight I feel at seeing you here as my guest.
And I think I can best repay your kindness by giving you a little
advice.
Emperor. A thousand thanks, my dear PRINCE, but pardon me,
where did you get that hat?
Prince. I scarcely know, Sire. And now about England
Emperor (interrupting). Stay, you must allow me. This hat for
yours (gires head cover-
ing). Why, it makes all
the difference! Look in
the glass and judge for
yourself! Why, you look
half your age!
Prince. Many thanks,
your Majesty, but I do
not wish to talk about
hats. I cannot help
thinking that the Triple
Alliance

Bother the TripleAlliance.
But tell me something in-
finitely more important
—where did you get that
coat?
Prince. Never mind
my coat; you must
know
Emperor (as before).
But I must mind about
your coat (producing
parcel). Here is one
fashioned like my own;
wear it for my sake!
Prince. Again many
thanks; but do leave my
clothes alone. You see,
if Russia joins hands
with France
Emperor (as before).
But I must call your
serious attention to the
condition of your waist-
coat! I say it's abso-
lutely awful. However,
you will find in this parcel
something that I Know
will please you! (Pro-
duce* parcel.) There,
my dear old man, take it
with my blessing. You
will find it very comfort-
able, because it is lined
throughout with fur.
Prince. Yes, yes; but
do let me talk of our
connection with Italy.
Practically the land i«
bankrupt, and
Emperor (<>nce again).
I dare say; but that has
nothing to do with your
frock-coat. (Produces
parcel.) See, I have got the very thing for you.
Prince. You are too good! But please let me give you my view
about Austria. Now you must know that the Emperor King is
Emperor. On bother the dual country! What I want to see is
something better in the shape of boots. In this parcel (produces it)
I have bought all that you can possibly desire in that line.
Prince. But I assure you, Sire, that I have everything I want,
and it would be a great thing if you and I could compare notes about
the English occupation of Egypt.
Emperor. Of course. But, dear me, I have forgotten your
umbrella! I must have left it in Berlin. I will go and feteh it;
or, better still, I will send it to you by parcel-post! I will be off at
once. So good-bye, my dear Prince, and may we soon meet again.

THE JUDGE'S GUIDE TO KNOWLEDGE.
(Compiled by the Bar fur tht vat of the Bench.)
Bar. And now, my good judge, can you tell me anything about
Mr. COEXEV GRAIN '(
Bench. No; but from his name I imagine he must be a celebrated
agriculturist.
liar. A very good answer, but not quite right. Mr. CORNET
GRAIN is a very clever entertainer, and has lived a good portion of
his life amongst RxKDS.
Bench. I see; a sort of water lily.
Bar. Not quite; but that is a natural inference. And I suppose
you know what is the
meaning of a bob?
Sench. A nod, a cur-
tesy! We have a bob
when Mr. BRIEFLESS bows
to me in Court, and I re-
turn the salutation.
liar. Well, not exactly;
by bob I meant a shilling.
And now can you tell me
what a prize-fighter means
when he says he had " got
into Chancery "?
liench. Why that he is
interested in an adminis-
tration suit, or has been
ihecauseof an originating
summons.
liar. Well, scarcely;
although from a profes-
-ional point of view no
fault can be found with
the definition. Do you
ki.ow what "tossing for
drinks "is?
Bench. I have no idea.
Stay; a mad bull tosses,
but then, as a victim to
hydrophobia, he avoids
drinks.
liar. Well, I think vou
have a glimpse of under-
standing, but you have
not got quite" the real
meaning. Now, 1 will
give you a professional
Itiestion. What is a
judge?
Bench. A man learned
in the law, but learned
in nothing cKe.
Bar. Quite right.
Now, does a j udge under-
stand the meaning of
slang?
liench. Slang! Why,
I never heard the word
before.
Bar. But ret, my Lord,
you have been young
yourself?
Bench. Yes, but never
since I became a judge.
And now, my rather—
too—learned friend, let
me ask you one question.
'THE UNHAPPY DISPATCH."
Do you know how to forget everything but ease law?
Bar. By existing on a desert island.
Bench. That is scarcely necessary. The easiest way to lose sight
of the barrister of the past is to become the judge of the present; and
having said this, I think we will resume the hearing of the case
which was under consideration when you became my cross-examiner.
[The Bench resumes its dignity, and the Bar subside*. Curtain.
PRACTICAL SUGGESTION.—As something must be done to increase
the number of men in the Navy, it is proposed to transfer the Royal
Horse Guards Blue to that Service, where they will in future be
known as the Ultra-Marines.
THEFT NO ROBBERY.—If you are acquainted with a collector of
water-colour drawings, why have you a right to pick his pocket?
Answer. Because he has piet-ures (pick'd yours) !.

II.—ONE SHILLING!
SHOVLD you go on a journey and fancy it dull
To have nothing to read as you travel,
You can purchase a book that is sure to be full
Of a mystery yon can't unravel.
But the talented author will do
it instead,
From obscurity clearness dis-
tilling,
It's a curious thing called a
"shocker" you 've read,
And it costs you — at book-
stalls — one shilling.

Our Army's a marvellous source
of delight
To those who are haply not
in it,
A glorious career of victorious
tight
And the raw'un is keen to
begin it.
When the youngster decides he
will march, drill,ind shoot
And Barkis-like says he is
willing,
The QUEEN 's so delighted to get
a recruit.
She presents him at once with
a shilling.
When a son falls in love with a beautiful maid,
Whose degree, notwithstanding, is lowly,
The father is apt, I am sorely afraid.
To use language you couldn't call holy.
The son swears for his part he means to be true,
But it's bad for the cooing and billing
When Papa says in terms—it's his bolt from the blue—•
That he '11 cut off his son—with a shilling.
You sec that a man has contrived to invent
A machine to make tea out of shavings.
Ere long an attractive prospectus is sent,
And ere long you make shares of your savings.
The directors aren't rogues—that were past all belief,
Yet when thev 've succeeded in tilling
Their pockets, the company quick comes to grief,
And you 're lucky if you get—a shilling!
MEETING THE METEOR.
To the Editor of Punch.
SIB,—I am surprised that scientific men should have remained

by the pavement. Once or twice the road seemed about to rise into
the air, and then as rapidly subsided again, the effect being to throw
me violently against an old friend of mine, who happened to be
walking next me. At first we treated this as a joke, and laughed at
it; but after it had continued for some time I became alarmed,
and was just about to summon assistance when I felt myself hurled
violently backwards. The back of my head struck the pavement
with some force, and at the same moment a beautiful constellation
of stars appeared, and shone with a bright light for the space of a
full second. Such was the force of the shock, that when I opened
my eyes I found I had been transported bodily to Vine Street. Can
any of your readers speak to a similar experience?
Yours faithfully, , IN VINO (STREET) VEBITAS.
SIB,—I hasten to inform you of an extraordinary natural phe-
nomenon bv which this peaceful suburban district was much dis-
turbed on Tuesday night. "It is my habitual custom before retiring
to bed to unchain the-Yorkshire terrier by whom my home is pro-
tected. I had just done so, as usual, when I suddenly perceived a
brilliant light coming up the road in front of my house. At the
same time a heavy and regular footfall sounded in the direction from
which the rays proceeded. At the same moment my cook, in whom
I place implicit confidence, rushed past me in a state of great alarm.
She, too, had seen the light and had been terrified by it. On going
out I found the policeman standing close to my front door, but he
had seen nothing, and could offer little intelligible explanation, as he
was engaged in the consumption of a frugal supper of bread and
cheese by which his utterance was impeded. Taking everything into
consideration, the only conclusion I can come to is that I saw a meteor
at the moment of its impact upon the earth. The hour, I should
state, was 10.15 P.M. Yours truly,
Camberwell. S. E. AGCLL.
SIB,—I write to say that a meteor, which was entirely hidden from
view by thick clouds, passed over this town at 10 o'clock last night.

Sin,—I cannot tell vou how shocked I have been at hearing from
my fnend and neighbour, the Reverend JOSHUA FLAMMKR, that a
large meteor was allowed to pass over this place last night!

FLOATING A BUBBLE.
Paragraph (printed in bold double-leaded type).—We have reasons
for believing that it is not impossible that the Beadle intends shortly to
resign. The Beadle is at present away on leave, but on his return
will probably acquaint the members ot the Vestry with his decision.
Paragraph (in type a little larger and slightly more leaded).—In
regard to a rumour published by a contemporary that it is the in-
tention of the Beadle to resign, we have it on the most reliable
authority that nothing is known of the matter in the best informed
municipal circles.
Paragraph (eren more "displayed" than its premiers). — At
a late hour we have ascertained that nothing is known of the
rumoured resignation at the Beadle's private address. In reply to a
wire it is now stated that the Beadle has gone out for the day and is
not expected back until to-morrow.
Paragraph (special).—We have reasons for believing that the
reported, intendea resignation of the Beadle is a canard. As the
Beadle has not yet confirmed the report or denied its veracity it will
be necessary to publish an extra edition containing further and later
particulars.
Paragraph (extra special).—The Beadle has come home and is
considering his reply. It is believed in well-informed quarters that
the rumour of his reported intended resignation is to say the least
premature.
Paragraph (extra special special).—Nothing further is known of
the Beadle s intentions, but as he smiled when he received his tele-
grams it is conjectured that he considered his rumoured intended
resignation as a practical joke.
Paragraph (from a medical paper).—In regard to the rumour of the
intendea resignation of the Beadle, we have authority for saying that
it was the opinion of an eminent physician that his patient was
capable of eitner resigning or remaining at his work. There was no
medical reason for the resignation, and no medical reason for the
devotion to work. This valuable diagnosis of a difficult case was
handed to us with permission to make it public when the exigencies
ofjthe situation seemed to demand its open circulation.
Official Dispatch (furnished by the Private Secretary to the
Beadle).—With regard to the rumoured intention of the Beadle to
resign, it is well to point out that the situation remains unaltered.
The Beadle is aware that he may resign at any moment, but then he
may not resign: it may be for years, it may be for ever. Intentions
are not facts, and facts are not intentions. What may happen to-
day may not have happened yesterday, and may not be repeated
to-morrow. The point of this observation depends upon its applica-
tion. And this being so. the Beadle wishes everyone good luck, and
counsels everybody to keep a sharp look-out a-head. This, the
Beadle begs to observe, was the advice of Jack Jiunsby, and is quite
worthy of being accepted as a wholesome precedent.
Newspaper Commentary (from one point of r/etr).—It will be
seen, that as there is no smoke without fire, there is every reason for
believing that the rumoured intention (of which we were the first to
give publicity) was amply warranted by the then existing situation.
Newspaper Commentary (from a different point oftiew).—It will
be seen, from the communication authorised by the Beadle, that our
contemporary who was the first to announce the intended resigna-
tion of the eminent gentleman has been amusingly hoaxed. The
situation which has existed for months seems to be entirely
unchanged.
Commentary by the General Public.—Thanks to the misunder-
standing about the Beadle's resignation, we seem to have purchased
without any necessity a very large number of newspapers.
AMOK VIXCIT SAXDOW.—Sandow's latest and most important
engagement has just been publicly announced. It is to Miss
BLANCHE BURNS, of London; and it looks like a genuine ardent love-
affair—at any rate, it suggests passion at trhite heat. They have
our best wishes.

"OH, LET ME BE YOUR VALENTINE I"
AN UNAMBITIOUS DESIRE.
PRAY tell me, Mr. Punch, what ails
The man who 'd make this queer request,
Oh, say wherein the fellow fails
Who 'd seek to swop his swallow-tails
For feeble finery at best.
I marvel not that man should sing
He 'd like to be a butterfly;
The insect is a living thing,
However soon its life goes by;
But ne'er as yet has living sign
Been present in the Valentine!
The world is very hard, I know,
And human fate is beastly rough,
And hearts that make a tender show
Will often prove intensely tough;—
I know that in the scales of life
Our woe exceeds the weight of joy—
'Twas thus when first began the strife,
And Earth was quite a little boy.
But, still, that can t excuse the line,
"Oh, let me be your Valentine!"

Ambition's bent we all admire—
No doubt 'tis very right we should;
But who '11 respect the mad desire
To be a Valentine? Who could f
I 'd rather be a rat, a mouse,
A cat, a cow, a cockatoo,
A tenant of a monkey-house,
A bounding, boxing kangaroo,
A'lone and loveless porcupine,
Before I 'd be a Valentine!
At all events, the things I 've named
Can move and eat and pay you calls;
And that is more than can be claimed
For Valentines on fancy-stalls.
Besides, the wish is so absurd.
For how could mortal ever be
At once four Cupids pink, a bird,
Some knots of ribbon (two or three),—
To mention nothing of the line,
"Oh, let me be your Valentin*!"
Mi/ heart's a tender one and true,
0 lady that I love the most!
1 'd rather have it crushed by you
Than flattened bv the parcel post!
And even though all safe and sound
1 reached you—with no dent above—
I question if I should be found
An eligible thing to love.
And that is why I cannot whine,
Dear girl, to be your Valentine!

DEVELOPMENT: A DREAM OF POLITICAL DARWINISM.
[There is a fine Orchid, believed to be the only one of its kind known,
which has been named Anthiirium Ckamoerlainium. [*»* See our specimen,
re-christened " Josephta CitbicHlariits."]
"Sir WILLIAM HAKCOURT (said Mr. CHAMBERLAIN at Edgbaston) had
recently sneered at him as a former Radical whose Radical days had passed
away. He did not complain. He accepted the designation."
"New forms (of Orchids) are produced by hybridising more rapidly than
wild ones are detected. . . . Natural hybrids are not common. ... In
cultivation, however, plants which naturally grow a thousand leagues apart
can be brought under the same roof ... so that all that is required is skill
on the part of the fertiliser to effect on a much larger scale what Nature has
been slowly doing for ages."—Stilti on Orch\ds.~\
OH! Anthurium Chamberlainium was a plant of sturdy growth,
Unique in flower and foliage, in form and colour both.
The proletariat's pride and pet, so smart, and trim and tall,' m«
That it scarce seemed an exotic or a parasite at all.
E'en the Working Man, who loves his plant o' musk or red geranium,
Admired quite unsuspectingly Anthiirium Chamberlainiiim.
The Horny-handed hasn't much helief in foreign flowers
You've to coddle up in hot-houses, and shield from Nature's showers;
But this sturdy Bulb of Brummagem put forth a bonny blossom,
More like a British garden-bloom than a swell Oduntoglossum,
Or Dendrobium suacissimum (Balfourian and Burmese)
Or some languid Leelia elegans, all pround patrician ease.
'Twas nicknamed Cochlea simplex; for your Orchid is a mime
And imitates all sorts of things from simple to sublime,
From a spider to a slipper; and it seemed to cursory view
That the sepals of this Orchid took some semblance of a screw,
In their spiral or vermicular appearance. But what odds?
Anthiiriiiin Chamberlainiiim pleased the gallery and the gods;
And the manlv Midland Radical, that plain and sturdy soul.
Would sport this special Orchid in his Sunday button-hole.
But Nature is a rum "tin—in the words of Mr. Squeers—
And had they read their Darwin well, they might have felt some fears,
These friends of the Screw-Orchid. For 'tis really quite surprising
What wonderful developments are wrought by hybridising.
The change was slow and gradual, and what social butterfly
Had played cross fertiliser, or what sinister and sly
Night-flying moth malignant, or striped wasp with venom swollen,
Had tainted stout Rad stigma with the touch of Tory pollen,
Who knows? Alas! it came to pass; the simple, honest, plain
Screw-Orchid got contaminate by quite another strain;
Proved, to its proletariat admirers' wrath and dolour,
Like some from New Granada, "very variable in colour."
It donned municipal maroon and gold, of gorgeous hue,
It's honest buff gave gradual place to stripes of royal blue.
Its " native hue" was "sicklied o'er" with lurid mirple patches;
It drew mere modish butterflies in Primrose-tinted batches.
They wheeled like winged houris round its parasitic glories,
Polychromatic splendours tit for peacocks—who 're the Tories
Of the finely-feathered kingdom, and were therefore loved by DIZZY—
Since they 're useless, noisy, arrogant, and never, never busy.
Cried old friends of our Screw-Orchid, "we have been besotted
sillies.
This Anthiirium Chamberlainium is worse than SOLLY'S Lilies!
It toils not, neither does it spin, it scorns the Gladdyolus
Which once it used to worship, just as we do, holus-bolus.
Alas for hybridising! The downward change immense is.
The Protocryptoferox Madagascariensis,
Which intent upon destruction in the jungle lurks and cowers
'Midst the gay JSulophiella with its lurid-purple flowers,
Is not more strange and sinister. 'Tis ' developing,' yes, daily.
Already party-coloured, it takes on the True-Blue gaily.
It scorns the Shamrock-green it loved, Imperial purple doffing,
And at the Quaker-tinted tribe it loved to dwell with scoffing.
Like all its class mimetic, it is growing proud and courtly;
The Screw into the Coronet you '11 see develop shortly.
Though not porphyrogenittis, the purple it will borrow.
That faint foreshadowing of a crown may prove no dream—<o-

QUESTION" FOR IMPATIENT IMPERIALISTS.—Is it not more urgently
important that our people should be fed, than that they should be

LAW IN UNCOMMON FORM.
RELUCTANT as I am to force my own personality upon the public, I
feet it my duty to comment upon an article upon "the lax state of legal
education," which has recently appeared in the influential columns
of the Times newspaper. And I further consider it my mission to
offer to the organ of the
Bar those remarks that, so
to speak, whelm over my
brain in the hours of prac-
tice. Punch for more thau
half a century has been the
representative of Justice
and her votaries, and
amongst the latter I count
the Lord Chancellors and
the judges, "silk" and
"stuff," and in fact every
one having the right of
audience in the Royal
Court, or any other Superior
Court in the United King-
dom. The Times insists
that our legal education can
be improved, and amongst
various proposals suggests
that the Council should
provide, "within reasonable limits, varied instruction to meet the
wants not only of lawyers but also of the not unimportant part of
the public interested in the same matters." I support the proposal.
Surely the time has arrived when legal education should be popu-
larised. Lectures should be made palatable not to students only,
but to that "not unimportant part of the public" (to quote the
Times) that loves a lecture accompanied by music, and attended by
dissolving views. To show that it would be perfectly easy to
deliver such an address, I jot down a few ideas that have occurred to
me while waiting for expected communications from my learned and
esteemed friends Mr. JOHN HOLLAMS, Messrs. BOLTOX AND MOTE,
and Sir GEORGE LEWIS. I will i magi no that I am standing in the
Hall of Gray's Inn, with a broad disc behind me, and in the music-
gallery a lantern, fitted with appropriate views. I report my speech:—
MY LORDS, MASTERS OF THE BENCH, UTTEB BARRISTERS, STU-
DENTS, AND GENTLEMEN,—As we have but a short time at our
disposal this afternoon (owing to the need of getting hall ready for
sir o'clock dinner), I purpose making my remarks as few and as
brief as possible. You will be glad to see a place remembered by
many here present, and known by repute to us all. (Rings bell.
Westminster Ilall appears on disc. Applause. Organ effect.)
We are reminded by the solemn music that it is near the Abbey, and
those offices of Parliamentary Agents which are the source of so much
profit to those who practise upstairs." Here is the Abbey. (Hell.
Change on disc. Applause.) And a well-known office in Parliament
Street. (Hell. Change of scene on disc. Thunders of applause.)
I thank you for your kind appreciation. (Applause.) I will now
tell you how I read for the Bar. (Conuc song, introducing the mys-
teries of cramming. Immense applause.) Thank you. Having thus
shown you lyrically how things can be done, with the assistance oi
a coach, I will conclude my lecture, which I fear has been too long
(" No. JVo.") with a series of photographic reproductions of men
and places connected with the profession to which most of those
present have the honour to belong. (Sell.) "EDWARD THE FIRST,
the English Justinian." (Sell.) "Sir PETER EDLIN, presiding at
the London County Sessions." (Sell.) "Lord COLERIDGE, thinking
on the Bench on a sultry afternoon." (Cheers.) "The Old Bailey
by moonlight." (Solemn music.) "A caricature by Mr. FRANK
LOCKWOOD. Q.C., M.P." (Laughter.) "Mr. Justice NORTH hearing
a case in Chambers." (Renewed laughter.) "The last brief of tho
dying Junior." (Solemn music.) And last, but not least, "Our
Clients," including portraits of the most eminent Solicitors on the
Rolls. (Cheers.) And now, my Lords, Masters of the Bench, Utter
Barristers, Students, and Gentlemen, I _have nothing more to do
than to thank you for the very kind way in which you nave received
my poor efforts to combine amusement with instruction. I bid vou
one and all a respectful farewell. (Loud and prolonged cheering.)
I could not only deliver an address, but arrange for the introduction
of more or less comic interludes, such as "The Learned Pig," "Captain
Coke and his Ventriloqnial Entertainment," "The Bounding
Brothers of Bohemia in their refined Robing-Room Seance," and
"Dazy Blackstone, the fascinating Inns of Court Serio-Comique."
Of course these features would be intended not so much for lawyers
as "for the not unimportant part of the public interested in such
matters." I shall be glad to give full particulars as to fees, &c., at
my chambers, with the assistance of Mr. PORTINGTOX, my senior
clerk, any day during term time from nine to six and during vacation
from ten to four. (Signed) A. BKIKKLF.SS, Ju.v.

SHERIDAN BU-CANOMSED!
WHAT fatal dementia seized upon Bon BUCHANAN that he should
have written a play on Dick Sheridan f Had he been as familiar
with his subject as he has been with the Christian name of his un-
played by Mr. EDMUND MAURICE, who, now, as representing the
stern pairent who has but one daughter an unkimmon tine young
gal," is much "exercised" in spirit, and has to observe, in the course
of other sapient remarks, that "he has some difficulty in making up
his mind," which, by the way, can be nothing to the difficulty he
"
fortunate hero he might possibly have taken more time and more
thought, if either would have assisted him, before giving (for a con- „ , ,
sideration) this " new and original comedy " to a mighty censorious and had to alter from brown to grey) it is rare to see, even in these
world. However, 'tis done, and there's an end on't, or soon will be, j days of ultra-perfection in the art of "making up."
but in the meantime let me congratulate the principal actors in this «•---" • ,, ,
series of scenes from the life of Dick Sheridan, arranged by BOB
BUCHANAN, not on the parts they play, but the way in which they
play them.
Pnysical resemblance between RICHARD BRIXSLEY SHERIDAN, as
e must have experiencen in making up his face, for "a more complete
- change of front" (as the old lady said who didn't wear her own hair,
Then there is Mr. JOHN BYRON, who very carefully plays Abedne-
go, in a tediously witless scene (quite representative of "R. B."
without the "SHERIDAN"), and Mr. WILL DENNIS, who does his
utmost to realise, to himself at least, even if others remain uncon-
vinced, that he is a living representative of DAVID GARRICK, and,
known to us by his portraits, and Mr. H. B. IRVING there is none; ' for the matter of that, so he"is, for does he not represent David
but, physically and mentally, he is as like Dick Sheridan as Mr. I Garrick " as he is wrote" by Mr. ROBERT BUCHANAN, whose work,
BOB BUCHANAN has allowed him to be. What an unconscionable ' by his own admission, " has no pretensions to historical accuracy in
dull dog, though a bit of a " rantin' roarin' boy," too, on occasion, | matters of detail"?
is this Bu-canonised Dick Sheridan.' Like the saturnine CHAHLES It is by Miss WINIFRED EMERY, as Miss Elizabeth Linley, or
THE SECOND of merry memory, this Dick Sheridan often says a rather as herself playing the heroine, whether the name be Linley
foolish thing (and a very prosaic one too) and never does a wise one. or any other, that the piece has to stand, even if it stand totteringly.
She is strong enough to
support the poor thing;
and she may impart to it
some of her own vitality.
But what is there for her
to do? Where is there
scope for the actress to
act? There is much
vapouring, and much
appealing, as it were, to
the SHERIDAN tradition
in order to enlist the
sympathies of the public
for Mr. BUCHANAN'S
namby-pamby heroine:1
It seems to me a thank-
less part, which only the
auctoritas of the actress
can make occasionally
interesting. Is there in
it one really strong and
telling situation depend-
ent on the heroine alone?
By the way, one word
witli Mr. WALTER HAXN,
whose scenery is admira-
ble, and with Mr. HAST-
INGS the Stage Manager.
Are Sheridan's lodgings
next door to Mr. Linlei/'s
house? Why do I ask?
Because when the cur-
tains of the window in Miss Linley's jxjudoir (Act III.) are not quite
closed, the same view is distinctly visible as is seen from the window
(Act II.) of Sheridan's lodgings in London. Mr. WALTER HAXN
will go for a change to Hastings.
Mr. ROBERT BUCHANAN did exceptionally well with Tom Jones and
Joseph (why didn't he call him " JOE " ?) Andrews at the Vaudeville.
But that was "once upon a time," and, however well he succeeded
with Tom and Joe, BOB has shown that, to use the slang of a year or
so ago, now happily almost out of date, he is not " up to Dick."
THE B IN Box.
However, young Mr. IR-
VING, considering that
after all he is little more
than a beginner, plays
this part (such as it is,
and thank BUCHANAN for
it) so well that we may
look forward to his suc-
cessful appearance as
Joseph Surface and then
as Hamlet. II ira loin.
The eccentric part of
Dr. Jonathan O Leary,
a kind of Dr. O'Toole,
the Irish tutor, with a
dash of that very old-
fashioned pedagogue Dr.
Panyloss, is made the
most of by Mr. BRANDON
THOMAS, who indeed adds
to the natural gifts of the
individual by throwing
in here and there just so
much flavour of Scotch
accent as suggests the
observant ancT retentive
traveller. With spright-
ly Miss PATTFE BROWNE
as Mrs. Lappet the lady's
maid (a name fashioned
on the good old farce
principle of styling a

Following his Father*! Footsteps.
tailor Mr. Button, a butcher Mr. Chops, and so forth, a plan adapted
to the meanest capacity of theatre-going intelligence), Dr. O Leary
Thomas is responsible for the conventional low comic relief, a kind
of forlorn hope in such cases, essential to most pieces, and more especi-
ally to Adelphi Dramas, to which class of entertainment this play,
with its turgid sentiment, its scowling villain, its aforesaid low
comedy "relief" of servant and maid, its stern parent, its secret
marriage, its heroine in distress, and its duel in the room by candle-
light, evidently aspired to belong.
Had BOB taken more thought over DICK, he might perhaps, with
the aid of a collaborator such as was the late Mr. HENRY PETTITT,
and by eliminating Sheridan, and introducing a railway accident
or a battle-scene, have realised by it a considerable fortune at the
Adelphi; and then he could have retired and amused himself, if
nobody else, by writing comedies for nowhere in particular on the
model of this Dick Sheridan.
Mr. CYRIL MAUDE is always marvellous in his making up, and
this latest trarestie of his as Lord Dazzleton (another farce-name!
So good!) is quite equal to anything he has previously done. The
part is as admirably played as the picture is painted by this artist
from the sketch given him by BOB, the author.
With excellent effect does Mr. LEWIS WALLER represent the
Adelphi-Drama-villain, Captain Matthews, who is not at all the
Captain MATTHEWS of SHERIDAN'S true story; but as "R. B."
[not "RICHARD BRIXSLEY" without the SHERIDAN, but " ROBERT
BUCHANAN") explains in a foot-note to the bill, "this Comedy has
no pretensions to historical accuracy in matters of detail," we must
be satisfied with the goods the gods provide, and no more question
letails of this historical unhistorical pastoral-comico-tragical comedy,
ihan we would inquire too curiously into the excellence of the raw
property materials for Dr. (fLeary's Irish stew.
Mr. SrDNEY BROUGH has a character closely resembling that
horsey " one of the Tom-and-Jerry period in Sowing the Wind, then

A THEOLOGICAL DISPUTE.
THE Piano was accompanying
the Fiddle. They were getting
on together in perfect harmony,
and, whilebeing played upon, they
were holding a theological discus-
sion. They waied warm. They
indulged in rather forcible lan-
guage, and got so far as to bring
in Latin by way of exhibiting
their theological knowledge.
"Ah, my dear," exclaimed the
Fiddle. "What you want is the
Latin representative of myself in
the tifth declension, Fides, Fidei,
Faith!"
"Fiddle-de-dee!" replied the
Piano. '' What you want is what
you '11 never have, and what /
nave always got."
"And that is?" inquired the
Fiddle.
"Works my dear, works!"
But the discussion was brought
to an end by a bang from the
pianist and a violent scrape from
the violinist, and then both instru-
ments were silent.
ABOUT AN OPTIMIST. — "All
musical people," says the Times,
and rightly, "will regret to hear
that, under the peremptory order
of his medical adviser, Mi. W. T.
BEST has resigned his position as
organist of St.George'sHall, Liver-
pool." We are indeed sorry; but
when the Best isdone,—well,—the
Best can do no more. Let us, as
optimists, hope that this case will be
an exception to the proverbial rule.
But it will be difficult for anyone
to " go one better" than BEST.

MR. JUSTICE HAWKINS had quite a grand day of it last Tuesdav

before his lordship and a special jury. It ought, indeed, to be a

and they will try some of the very best cases, the contents of which
are as sparkling as if the cases were of the very best champagne.
Replied a witness to a question put by Sir HENRY, " An agent
(it was a picture-dealing case) would object to disclose his princi-
pal." "So," said Sir HENRY at once, "would a thief." Whereat
'' laughter." Not'' suppressed," you may be sure; not even'' suppressed
with difficulty." Subsequently, Mr. McCALL, Q.C., who should be
"Mr. WHAT-YOU-MAY-CALL, Q.C." (with apologies to Sir HENRY),
said that a Mr. BUCK, when questioned as to his selling price,
"blushed like a school-girl." Quoth Mr. Justice HAWKINS: I con-
fess I did not see much sign of blushing or of the school-girl about
Mr. BUCK" (laughter). But what a chance was here lost by his
lordship! Not much blushing about Mr. BUCK, truly, but had it been
"ROE * or "DOE," or any other "little deer "? Eh? Why, the
Court would have been in convulsions!
Then, said Mr. Justice HAWKINS slily, before adjournment:—
"I gather your arguments "—(Pretty picture this! Judge " gather-
ing arguments," like "Gathering rosebuds while ye may!")—" are
these: You, Mr. LEWIS THOMAS, contend that GROOME was a factor,'
and you, Mr. McCALL. that he was a 'malefactor.'" (Laughter.)
Bravo! Whereupon Mr. McCALL answered. "Just so." "The
Court then adjourned." What else could the Court do? Adjourned!
Carried out in fits of laughter! Judge off to his room chuckling!
Why cannot all summaries be done as neatly and wittily as this?
Let Sir HENRY occupy his rare leisure by going over the old reports and
"essencing" them, until he gets the lengthiest summinir up reduced
to this admirable model of "Factor" and "Malefactor." But of
course there is an " important factor" in this example that does not
occur in every case, or in one out of a hundred. But this is a difficulty
over which Sir HENHY will easily triumph.
OUE BOOKING-OFFICE.
THE Baron welcomes a daintily got-up book of Hood's Humorout
Poems, edited by Canon AINGER and published by MACMILLAN &
Co. Excellent old friends! delighted to see you again ! always read-
able, but now more readable than ever by reason of the clear type
and "open spaces." For prose and verse, to thrive, require open
spaces just as much as do authors and readers. The illustrations
are not quite up to the humour of the poems, yet if ever there were
a chance for a humorous illustrator it is at his service in these very
comic verses. Canon AINGER has made himself responsible for the
editing of this new edition, and has written a pleasant biographical
preface in which his Canonical Reverence appears as the apologist of
the pun. Good wine needs no bush, and a good pun needs no
apology. A written pun is one thing: a spoken pun is quite another.
The first appeals to the eye; the second to the ear; and the second
depends for its immediate success on the accidents preceding and ac-
companing its utterance. Most of the best spoken puns will not bear
repetition. Not only is it " what he said" but "the way he said it,"
and the time and place of his saying it. The Canon's appreciation of
TOM HOOD is both just and generous; but his Reverence's reverence
for his author's work has caused him to leave undeleted one
stanza which will offend many not otherwise inclined to take um-
brage at anything " in the canon's mouth." "I am sorry for this,"
quoth the Baron; "and, but that I would rather not indicate the
blot which may escape the notice of the heedless majority, I would
give him the page and the verse which, I fancy, the Canon himself
would, on second thoughts, like to omit." The Baron will say no
more, except to hint that the verse to which very many will take
objection, and which the Canon should most certainly have omitted,
is to be found within the first forty pages.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TOBY, M.P., IN THE TROPICS.
R.M.S. "Pembroke Castle." Off Madeira, Wednesday.—I take
up my pen to write these few lines hoping they find my dear Master
warm as they leave me at present. To-night being Wednesday he
will, I wot, be sitting round the Mahogany Tree with his young men
distilling wit and wisdom for coming generations and (incidentally)
eating a frugal meal. I wish that I might take my accustomed seat
at his feet on the heap of volumes that, ever
growing, do not increase in bulk or height.
I should indeed be glad to sit at any table
which would behave itself in ordinary, not to
say tabular fashion. Our dining-table has
had the fiddles on dav by day from agitated
breakfast to illusory dinner. Neptune pipes
and we dance—at least, our knives and forks
and plates and glasses do. A voyage to the
Cape is not all beer and skittles. The early
part of it is the Bay of Biscay. Can't say
we 've had a gale, but there seems to have
been one blowing lustily for six or seven
weeks. We come in for what is called "the
swell," a more than usually undesirable
person to meet. The Member for Sark says
that, regarded as Master of the Rolls, ESHEH
not in it with the Bay of Biscay.
One gets used to the motion but it is fatal
to conversation. You walk up and down
deck with chosen companion; are in middle of interesting remark
when you discover you are alone. Friend and companion dear shot
off with catapultie force either to port or starboard as ship may roll.
"Ever been to the Cape before," I asked S\RK just now as we
staggered up and down.
"Never" he said, "but "(here he shot off, brought up sharp
by bulwarks on larboard side; being nearer centre of deck I held on
tUl roll to starboard brought SARK back again)—"my brother has."
This lasts only for day or two. Weeping may endure for the
night, but joy cometh with morning. Already we are within a
day's steam of Madeira, and the scene has changed. I believe it is
the astute Highlander DON CURRIE who arranges it all with a view
to permanent effect. If on leaving Southampton passengers found
themselves forthwith in summer seas they would not sufficiently
appreciate the rest and jovousness of the surroundings. The stormy
gateway of the Bay of Biscay is an incomparable approach for the,
thereafter, rarely ruffled beauty of the voyage over the sunlit waters
of the South Atlantic. We are not far off Madeira now; a wineglass
full, so to speak. But already summer has bloomed again. The days
have lengthened, the sun shines from a cloudless sky, and at night the

BORES! BORES!
I GENERALLY tire of things I hear a deal txxfmuch about.
The things that won't content themselves with living for a day;
The sentimental Coster-man who maunders his old Dutch about,
Or glorifies his Nipper—you'll confess he isn't gay.
With his kickseys and his buttons and his
everlasting moke,
And his East-End-lingo answer to "John
Anderson my Jo."
I seem to feel that Coster-men have got beyond
a joke;
I 'm tired of them, I 've done with them—
the Coster-man may go.
Of course it's very splendid in the halls that
court variety
To wring from breasts Belgravian the unac-
customed sob,
And force them to admit that the pursuits of
good Society
Are worthless when contrasted with the
feelings of the mob.
Ye dp it, 0 ye Coster-men, in many different "turns,"
With voices sometimes excellent, and some that are so-so;
But that rank is but the guinea-stamp we've learnt from ROBBIE
BURNS;
Your teaching seems superfluous—the Coster-man must go.
Full often (pray forgive the slang) I 've listened to a bally hen
That lays an egg and tells the news as loudly as she can;
I thought of this when reading how a poet called LE GALLIENNE
Had found the true Religion of a Literary Man.
But for all his pretty sentences I do not care a cuss
They 're froth stirred up with platitude and merely meant for show;
The literary men who with religion make a fuss
Deal far too much in fustian; they 're bores and they may go.

BUCHANAN and his grievances—I would that they were dead.
And all the silly tribe of merely advertising windy-men,
The Spooks and their mendacities, and cranky Mr. STEAD.
Of cranks and their creations we have had a qttantum stiff.;

has a history which makes up for the absence of electric lights, and
the lack of a larger smoke-room. Ten years ago, on the 18th Sep-
tember, 1883, twenty-nine royal personages—not counting DON
waves, gently undulous, flash in the moonlight that makes it almost
as bright as noon.
The Pembroke Castle is not one of the crack ships of the Castle
Line. As compared with the Xorham Castle or the Dunnottar she
And some of us are far from the religion of the Schools;
But why declare it all aloud, or use the little rope we have
To hang ourselves as warnings to unliterary fools.
You 're a clever lad, LE GALLIENNE; you've written pretty rhymes;
• To the creeds of crass Philistia be, if you will, the foe;
But let me here intreat you, Sir, don't, don't, a thousand times,
Don't prate about your sentiments, but rather let them go.
Would we could say a long farewell to literary shindy-men,
1883, twenty-nine royal personages — not
CURRIE, who rounds off the number — lunched in the dining saloon.
It was on the famous trip when DON CUBRTE captured Mr. GLADSTONE,
tore him away from labours that threatened to break him down, and
carried him round the west coast of Scotland to Norway. At Copen-
hagen the luncheon-party gathered. Mr. G. presided at the centre
table. TENNYSON took the port-side table (DoN CUHRIE knew his
weakness for 1834 and '47), the host taking the starboard table.
The guests included the Emperor and Empress of RUSSIA, the CZARE-
VICH; the King and Queen of DENMARK and their family; the
King and Queen of GREECE, and various royal grease-spots • the
Princess of WALES with their children; and the brothers of the
King of DENMARK. Ambassadors, Admirals, Generals, and such
small fry brought this historic luncheon party up to forty-five.
SARK says though the rose is departed, perfume still lingers round
the place.
I thought it was stewed mutton ; but SAUK, when he is not aggres-
sively practical, is succulently sentimental. I heard him just now
softly singing to himself —
'' You may break, you may shatter
The vase as you will,
The scent of the cauliflower
Clings to it still."
I notice he never passos through the saloon without removing his
cap and gazing reverentially round the chairs.
I am not the rose," he said, one afternoon, whilst we were still
in the Bay of Biscay; "but," he added, when he came back after
the usual brief excursion, " I shall always remember I have lived
near it."

Q. Is not Scotland Yard the

Q. Have not the Police

A. Assuredly, Sir. It is
their business to regulate the
traffic and to tell flower-girls
to move on.
Q. But ought they not to
prevent the use of inflamma-
tory language?
A. Practically, no. It would
be a legal action to arrest a
traitor, but it is considered to
be better not to attempt any-
thing of the sort.
Q. Does the Home Secretary
endorse this seemingly rather
mistaken clemency?
A. Certainly; by the ad vice
of the police.
Q. But if wild words are
tolerated, will not the weak-
ness shown by the authorities
encourage wild deeds?
A. Possibly; but that is a
matter for counsel's opinion.
Q. But would such an
opinion naturally prevent the
occurrence of an outrage?
A. Perhaps not naturally;
but it is invariably best to

THE NAVAL CONTEST.
(Translated from a Latin Fragment lately found in Oxford.}
THEN suddenly, while the runners in due order stand intent
upon the river-bank, bursts forth the explosion heralding the start.
TIMMIUS. a man not unused to shocks, himself the arbiter of destiny,
stands, firm and determined, above the lethal tube now vomiting
forth clouds of thick smoke and hateful noise; TIMMIUS, a sailor ot
rosy face and rotund figure, to whom daily the Oxonian tribes bear
offerings of stout beeves, hissing and juicy from the spit, or of
sheep, a wool-bearing herd, pastured where the red-bearded
Welshmen hold rule over tracts unpronounceable by merely mortal
mouths. There he stands, like to a rock beaten upon in vain by
furious waves, and surveys, calm and not unconscious of duty
accomplished, the tumult of them that with loud cries and
clangour of hideous instruments speed past him. And now the
contest waxes fierce. One behind the other the ships cleave the
water. The churned stream froths and eddies with the repeated
blow of broad oars. Not otherwise in Libyan Desert the famished
lion spies from afar his frail-limbed prey. His eyes glowing,
he hurls his body through the air, roaring with hope of food,
and the vault of heaven reverberates. So on the stream the ships
spring forth, each upon its destined victim, and on every side
fierce cries, the anticipation of triumph or the warning of defeat,
are borne aloft upon the wings of the affrighted wind.
First behold, flashing in warlike array over the smooth expanse of
water, the ship of them that worship the Brazen Nose, a pious race
of muscle-bearing men rendering at all times a due obedience to their
rulers, delighting in fire and battle and the clash of contending
arms. Lo, their broad backs bend forward unanimous, their flanks
heave, their eyes bulge from the sockets, and from their matted hair
the streaming sweat bedews their faces and all their vestments. The
helmsman, small in stature but in clamour a man. with wide-open
mouth exhorts them ever to renewed effort, reminding them of the
great deeds of them that went before, and not unwittingly deceiving
them both as to the lengths gained and the distance yet to be
traversed. They, heedless of everything save the instant backs of
TOt. CTI.
the untiring pursuers, pant and toil, their hands shoot forth as when
from the stricken wall the ball rebounds; forward they swing and
back, and the air is filled with foam. Far away in quiet homes their
kindly mothers sit, each engaged upon her allotted task of wool and
needle, or conversing with female slaves as is meet for them that rule
a household. They reck not of the labour of their sons, but, each
considering her own the handsomest and most famous, they go about
the simple duties of the day in peace and calm. So when the hen,
having duly hatched forth alien eggs, has reared a tribe of ducklings,
she busies herself on land after the manner of hens. But her downy
brood ruffle with web-footed endeavour the surface of a lake, for-
getting the firm earth and the toil of the hen-mother. Whom she
on a sudden perceiving calls back anxiously and in vain, and the
surrounding hills give back her cries of sorrow. Not otherwise the
mother of men, when she has become aware of their bodily contests
and the perils hardly to be avoided by those that wield the oar,
addresses herself to her neglectful sons, imploring them to desist.
Vainly seeks to restrain their ardour and invades their obdurate
hearts with anxious counsel of woollen garments and foot-coverings
to be changed when Jupiter has burst in showers from the sky and
all the land is soaked in water.
(Here the fragment ends.)

DUCAL DUMB SHOW.
(Being some Account of a Spectacular and Terpsicttvrcan Tour from
Addison Road to Conttantinople.)
Yoyxo HAROLD, l)uke of ORLEIOH, was master of an Old English
mansion and a "picturesque estate," with appropriately picturesque
tenantry, all young and lovely, and exquisitely dressed. As it was
May-Day, and his twenty-first birthday, he determined to celebrate
the occasion by starting on a journey to foreign lands with his
friend, Viscount RASHLEIGH, who, according to the Argument, had
"vowed to accompany HAROLD, and share his pleasures and his
dangers." So the villagers rose to the occasion, and determined to
give the young Duke what is professionally known as a " shove off."
First of all they crowned his guardian's daughter Queen of the
May, and then they sang him congratulatory choruses, and presented
him with a bouquet, whereupon he expressed heartfelt gratitude by
extracting several yards of invisible tape from his mouth, and indi-
cating by a few masterly gestures that his trunks were all packed
for the journey, and that he hoped his rascally valet had not for-
gotten his sponge-bag. Next came the indispensable ceremony of
the "Heading of the Will," which was performed by the family
solicitor, attired as a herald. The will was on a scroll, and he un-
rolled about three inches of it, just to give an idea of the general
effect, and the document was then, very sensibly, "taken as read."
any notice, thinking, perhaps, that he would see ballets enough
during his tour, and conscious, besides, that his time with the fair
ISABELLE was getting shorter and shorter. The villagers> indeed,
amiable and sympathetic as they were, were just a shade deficient in
tact. They would not understand, though the Duke did his best to
convey the idea by imitating the actions of ^flying and swimming for
their benefit, that they were confoundedly in his way, and that he
would prefer to say farewell to his fiancee with rather less publicity.
No, they had learnt a chorus of valediction expressly for this
. occasion, and they were not the people to let him off a line of it. So
J they stayed to see the very last of him. For, although his betrothed
j was positively broken-hearted at parting with him, and doing all
j that could be done in dumb show to induce him to postpone his
journey under the circumstances, it was no use—he icoiddn't stay.
i The gilded barge which was to convey him direct from the orna-
! mental lake of his ducal grounds to the coast of Spain was waiting
at the steps, and, after pulling sufficient tape to indicate that he was
going simply- from a strong sense of duty, and for the purpose of
j improving his mind by foreign travel, and that he would oe sure to
! come back some day and go on with the betrothal, he stepped on
j board, to the inconsolable grief of his fiancfe and another equally
young and lovely lady, whose affection and despair produced
unworthy suspicions of the Duke's constancy, until it was ascer-
tained from the programmes that she was only his mother, the
dowager-duchess. So the vessel slowly paddled away with him and


THE IIEIR TO THE DUKE-DUMB.
But it was generally understood that the young Duke had bequeathed
the title to the next of kin, in case of accidents.
After that he met ISABELLE, and recognised in her not only the
Queen of the May, but "the fair companion of his youth." One
might have thought that, as she was his guardian's daughter, and
there was nothing to indicate that they had ever been separated
hitherto, he need not have put off his recognition quite so long. Hut
that is the keynote of the Duke's character. He is dilatory. Well,
HABOLD, having recognised the fair ISABELLE, naturally went on to
experience the "Dawn of Love," which made a heavy demand on
his internal supply of tape. And in about two seconds they were
betrothed, and a pint of wine was served to the populace in six tin
cups, while, in a spirit of gentle irony, they exhorted each other,
in chorus, to—" Your goblets fill to the'briin, And drain them to the
end!"
At this stage the Viscount who was to be HAROLD'S travelling
companion arrived, and tape was pulled on both sides in reckless
profusion, while the Viscount was introduced to his friend's brand-
new betrothed, and they all retired to a little buffet on a balcony
next to tbe front door, from which they ignored the revels. This
was a pity, as they were well worth looking at. The villagers had
really taken immense pains over the affair; they brought out
graduated green platforms and stood on them in attitudes; they
played peep-bo behind bunches of lilac and cowslip; then all the
green and violet gardeners made themselves into a kind of hedge,
out of which pink flower-girls ran, saw the audience, turned
suddenly shy, and popiel in again, exactly like rabbits. Then they
finished up by dancing round maypoles, but the Duke wouldn't take
the Viscount. There was a little table on deck, with a gilt decanter
and goblets, in case they desired to assuage their sorrow, but, with
all its luxurious appointments, it seemed the sort of craft that would
be likely to have a lively time of it in the Bay of Biscay.
However, we were in Spain before we knew where we were, and
there was local colour in the shape of a pantomimic representation of
the rivalry of two toreadors for the hand of "the pretty PEPITA,"
who, the Argument informed us, was to be " given in marriage to the
victor in the coming bull-fight," to which they all went, in procession.
After that, the Duke came rattling on in a coach and six. He was too
late for the bull-fight, but he did not seem to mind that. His first
act on alighting was to return thanks to the chandelier for pre-
serving him from being tipped into the orchestra. Then PEPITA'S
father rushed on and began to ramp about, and pretend to pull off
his eyebrows and offer them for the strangers' inspection, and pat
himself on the pulse with fierce approval. This, however, was
merely the old gentleman's way of announcing that one of the
torfadors had been "wounded by the bull through the treachery of
his rival," which elicited much sympathy (of course, in the form of
tape) from the kindly young Duke. So they carried the wounded
man in on a mat, and PEPITA felt his heart and thought there was
life in him still, and HAROLD gave him " a purse of gold," and he
recovered promptly. Then there were great rejoicings, and a
Spanish dance, followed by evening prayers, after which we were
abruptly hurried off to Vienna, where we found "a fair in full
progress." A wonderful scene it was, too. with clowns, wire-
walkers, acrobats, quack doctors, dogs, monkeys, and showmen, all
too busy with their own performance to have time to attend to that

of anybodv else. Unfortunately the change was so rapid that the
young Duke and his friend the Viscount couldn't possibly get there
in time; perhaps their coach broke down, or they ran out of tape, or
something; at all events, the Duke did not turn up till near the end,
while, so far as we could observe, the Viscount never turned up at
all, and consequently missed one of the very best things in the whole i
entertainment.
Then came an interval of several minutes, and the Second Act!
began in Roumelio, Here the Duke was more dilatory than ever;
he arrived just too late to rescue a Turkish Princess from being
captured by brigands, and sold as a slave, and he entered Constanti-
nople on horseback, characteristically, at a sedate trot, "bringing
intelligence of the rapture of the Princess," thereby interrupting the
triumphal procession of the Prince, who was coming in with Virgins
in White, and "Turks in High Turbans and Gay Caftans," and
"Ladies of the Harem in Transparent Veils," and "Armenian
Camels carrying loads of costly Garments," and "Dancing
Negresses," and, very naturally, did not relish such an ill-timed
interruption. However, HAROLD explained everything by snatching
off a grey wig and beard from a respectable Oriental, and revealing
that he was not really elderly at all, but had quite black hair, which
so pleased the Prince that he took the young Duke into favour, and
"high honours were offered." But all the modest nobleman would
accept was "permission to witness the revels that were to follow."
He probably felt that, as. by some fatality, he had invariably
missed the revels all through the piece, this was his last chance of
j seeing any. He also intimated, so it was stated in the Argument,
! that " Adventures in the East being ended, he prefers to return to
j Kngland, Home, and Beauty, for in all his wanderings he has never
! forgotten the gentle lady who had won his heart, and he dearly loves
his native land."
Which was very pretty, but merely his tape: for he never did
return to the gentle lady. When the Curtain finally descended he
was still in the royal box, with the Prince and the Ladies of the
Harem, witnessing the sports by Genuine Arabs, and Grand Ballet
of the East. He really ought to have gone back, if only to give a
lucid and spirited account of his adventures to the fair ISABELLE in
his best tape.
But if tne story is, as has been hinted, just a trifle difficult to
follow, that matters little enough in a spectacle so brilliant and
exhilarating as "Constantinople," which no one will see once
without desiring to see again, and as many times as possible.
WISSELINGH WITHOUT A WHISTLER.
A HEAL treat. In a quiet little room at the Gallery of E. J. VAN
WissELiNiiH, at 14, Brook Street, is to be seen a charming exhibition
of pictures by French and Dutch masters. Hearing the name of the
exhibitor—WissELiJJfiH—it naturally saute aux lerres to ask for speci-
mens of WHISTLES. But though JAMES MCXEILE haa exhibited in
France, nothing from the Whistlerian brush is here. You will see two
delightful specimens
of J. F. MILLET, Nos.

—_ — «/«AB ing quiescent after
having had "a bad
night of it." Don't
miss No. 15, "The
Voting Bull" by C. TROYOX, representing a youthful animal re-
volving in his mind what his capacity of strength may be, and
what he shall troy-on next. But of all the woodland scenes, for
choice give us (and we '11 take it with pleasure) No. 29, by N. DIAZ,
called " The Forest." It is a glade in Fontainebleau. Exquisite!
What is its size? Eighteen inches by twelve—there or thereabouts;
and yet, as you sit in front of it, it shuts out the surroundings, and
the picture grows and grows, like the Genie in the Arabian Nights,
until it dominates the spectator, who will only wake from his dream
when he finds he cannot lie down under that tree, shading himself
from the sunlight, to enjoy a quiet, thoughtful post-prandial pipe.
"No smoking here, Sir," says the gentle guardian, and you wake up
from your reverie to find yourself in the show-room, and with several
pictures still to be seen.
It is quite in keeping with our dreamy state that we should turn
hopefully to " The Edge of the Wood," by ROUSSEAU (18), aroused
as we are from what has oeen not far removed from " Rousseau's
Dream." Yet what time of day is this when we find ourselves at this
point? Is it sunrise, or is it sunset? "By this light I cannot

tell!" And the reply, for the nonce, may be provided by that ancient
Greek Scholastikos, who to a somewhat similar query replied " that
he didn't know, as he was a stranger in those parts. _ Well, if
sunset, the sooner we're away the better; but if sunrise, let us
pic-nic here, and merrily pass the day under the greenwood trees.
Of JOSEF ISRAELS there are some excellent specimens, and those
who up to now " knew not JOSEF," should lose no time in visiting
this collection. Note " The Task" or, as its second title might be,
"AStitchin Time sa-:es Nine," representing a girl makingthe most of
"The light that fades." Very perfect and yet a " sew-sew " subject.
Another of JOSEF'S is No. 21, "The Toy Boat," which, adapted,
might be taken as representing our shipbuilding authorities con-
sidering their latest venture. Here are three fisher-girls watching
the progress of a sabot which has been rigged up as a vessel. 'Tis a
sabot, and one of our naval authorities would certain^ have "put
his foot in it."
Then later on, at No. 38, JOSEF gives us "A Fisher-Girl" alone,
coming home empty handed, with no nets, suggesting a general idea
of "hard lines," and her strong legs and arms all mussels. Most
effective. Then there is 41, also by JOSEF, a study of "A Break-
fast," which is being eaten by a little girl, while the cat, who thinks
that where there is enough for one there must be some for two, is
anxiously watching the progress of the meal. Finally JOSEF gives
us No. 43, "The t'hurc/ucardeti," which is "Prodigious!" It is
St. Ledger Day, and the old "Dutch Uncle" is going over his
account-Dooks, while his wife knitting on anxiously watches him.
"'Tis all knitting, knit, knit, knitting. And 'tis all knitting at our
house at name."
Mr. J. S. FORBES is, we believe, the fortunate possessor of moat
of these pictures, which, as a great benefactor of his art-loving fellow-
creatures, he is now exhibiting to the public; and proud and happy
may he be to point to himself as the possessor of "My Old Dutch.
IS FLIRTING ON THE INCREASE?
M_H. PUNCH has been applying his great mind to this question.
Living, as he does, amidst a bevy of the most beautiful girls in this
or any other country, he has exceptional opportunities for coming to
an accurate conclusion on the point. Mr. Punch would be false to
himself if he forgot for a moment the distressing circumstances that
attended the rupture of his own domestic happiness and the removal
from his side of the fondly-cherished partner of his joys and sorrows.
Since that melancholy event Mr. Punch has lived a strictly single
life. But there have been alleviations, and one of the chief has
been the society of delightful charmers who are not averse to flirting.
Why shouldn't they flirt, bless their pretty eyes? Think of life
without any flirting amenities. How inexpressibly dull it would
become. To know not only that all one's gallant badinage would be
taken at the foot of the letter (by the way, never write letters; they
are too compromising), but further that you yourself were bound to
see an abyss of solemn meaning in every dimple, a vista of conjugal
possibilities in every wreathed smile—that would be far too horrible.
Monasteries and Nunneries would cover the land and teem with in-
habitants. No. no! While life endures let flirting, with its gay and
sportive trivialities so abhorrent to prigs and dullards, continue and
increase. Punchius dixit.
"FANCY!" exclaimed Mrs. R. "Why I remember hearing the
name of 'Pizarro' when I was quite a child! There was a play all
about him; and last week I heard somebody read out from the Pall
Mall Gazette that his mummy had been found! What a very old
woman she must be! Quite a centipede! I"

Where now were thine House and thee, save

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
MR. FRANCIS ADAMS, the
writer of The Xetc Egypt, is,
we are told, dead—dying al-
most literally pen in hand,
• hurrying to finish this cher-
ished work before he turned
:his face to the wall. It is a
circumstance that makes it the
more pleasant to be able hon-
; estly to esteem the book. Mr.
ADAMS was, perhaps, inclined
too-seriously to regard himself
and his self-appointed task of
telling an ignorant world all
about Egypt. He resents any
other authorities who have
writtea on the subject, and
even, my Baronite tells me,
speaks disrespectfully of Mr.
MOHEBLEY BULL. He reserves
his unqualified approval for
the young Khedive, with
whom, on behalf of an enter-
prising London evening paper,
he had an interview. The
chapter in which this conver-
sation is reproduced throws a
strong light on the character
of a personage who seems dis-
posed just now to come into
unexpected prominence, a ten-
dency, which makes opportune
Mr. FISHES UNWINDS pub-
lication of this work.
"My dear Baron, what do
you think of it P" "My dear
Sir," replies the Baron,
"when a novel brought out
by that astute publisher Mr.
HEINEMANN has not only
reached its Nineteenth Thou-
sand but has also passed into
the enormous circulation of a
cheap edition in one volume,
it is rather late in the day to
ask me, the Baron, to express
any opinion on its merits;
though, by the way, I would
far rather pronounce on these
than on its demerits. Frankly,
then, I must admit that as
long as the Heavenly Twins
were on the scene as girl and
boy together, their diversions
delighted me hugely, and I am

bound to admit that I looked
upon all the other characters
in the somewhat meandering
story as rather—excuse me—
wearisome intruders. The real
persons of the real story seemed
to me to belong to what Mr.
RIDER HAGGARD would style
'another story.' I should have
liked the Twins, and only the
Twins, and nothing but the
Twins. Finally, the Twins
disappointed me." "What
did you expect Baron?"
"Ah, that is somewhat diffi-
cult to answer either to my
own or the inquirer's satisfac-
tion. The Twins themselves
are a creation: the epithet
'Heavenly' for these two mis-
chievous little fiends is ad-
mirable. The gods love them,
yet they live on, and become
mere mortals. True: life-
like : but an unromantic finish
after so much romance. Yet
'tis a remarkable book, leav-
ing me under the impression
that SARAH GRAND, the clever
literary mother of these Jfea-
vfitly Ttrins, had not quite
made up her own mind as to
their treatment. The public
has, however, taken lovingly
to the Twins, and everywhere
they are universally popular."
So the Baron, adopting the
practical Pickwickian solution
of the electioneering problem,
"shouts with the biggest
crowd."

stack would you take measures
to prevent him from carrying
his intention into effect?
A. Scarcely.
Q. Certainly. And if you

Q. Correct again. And if
you noticed a man with an

THE WISDOM OF THE TURTLE.
(A Fable for London the Great and London the Greater.)
A MAN once made up his mind to give a feast to the lower animals
of the field. But that they might all be satisfied he determined on
asking their opinions about the bill of fore. He first came to the
Donkey, who was educating himself on thistles.
"Would you like turtle-soup on the menu ?" questioned the Man.
"Although I am a member of the School Board, I am not such an ass
as to think that such a toothsome dish would be otherwise than
excellent."
Satisfied with this reply, the Man travelled on until he came to
someparochial geese who were dawdling about a pump.
"Would you not like a banquet'? " asked the Man.
"We are not sure!" hissed out the Geese. "What was good
enough for our fathers is good enough for us. We object to change."
"But," persisted the Man, "if I do provide you with a banquet,
you would like the feast to commence with turtle-soup?"
"We are not such geese as not to be pleased with that," answered
the Geese. "It stands to reason that if we get turtle gratis, we
must be the gainers by the transaction."
Pleased that his suggestion had been taken in such good part, the
Man continued his journey until he came to a fox.
"Hullo, my friend," said the Man, "I see you are no longer a
member of the Board of Works; yon have changed your quarters."
"Yes," returned the Fox; "out not my nature. My new place is
called the L. C. C. However, you must not detain me, as I am ex-
cessively busy in doing nothing in particular. What do you want?"
"Well," returned the Man; not too well pleased at the reception
of his civility; "I was thinking of asking you to a banquet, and
heading the menu with a plate of turtle-soup."
"Quite right," replied the Fox; "but as I consider the turtle my
own particular property, I shan't thank you for that plate. How-
ever, you may as well serve him up."
The Man walked on, and at length arrived at the home of the
turtle.
"My good friend," said the representative of humanity, "I am
going to give a banquet to your neighbours, the Donkey, the Fox,
and the Geese. Can vou suggest an appropriate menu f"
"Why not let the Fox eat the Geese, and the Donkey might con-
tinue to munch his thistles."
"But they all say they would like to devour you," begun the Man
in a studiously polite toue; "and I don't see how I can disappoint
them."
"Why not ?" asked the Turtle. "I am sure they do not appre-
ciate me as much as I appreciate myself."
"Well, well, I am afraid it is settled. But as you are a most
respectable creature, I do not mind you telling me now you would
like yourself to be cooked."
"It seems to me rather waste of time to comply with such a sug-
gestion. I don't want to be cooked, and I decline to be eaten."
"Well, at least you will give every assistance in serving yourself
up at table?"
"Not at all. You have no right to expect it. And you know that
it is more than you would get from a goose, a fox, or even an ass."
And the Man, being an average man, in his heart of hearts
believed that the Turtle was in the right.
MORAL.—When dealing with the rights of the City of London, it

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LAYS OF THE CURRENCY.
TO A FARTHING.
On! little coin that dangles
on my chain.
Like Captain SHAW, "type
of true love kept under,"
The sight of you brings with
it much of pain.
And, seeing how I got you,
that's small wonder.
It is a tragic story. She was
fair;
She had the kind of look
that might embolden
The humblest man take heart
to hope. Her hair,
I hardly need to add, as
good as golden.
We met, not in the customary
crowd,
But at a small, select, swell
Cinderella.
When we were introduced,
she sweetly bowed—
Well, ere the dance was
done, I called her BELLA.
I know that it was rash, but
then her eves
Spoke liquid nothings to
my heated passion,
And looked at me in startled,
sweet surprise,
In quite the truest amatory
fashion.
We said good-bve. I did not
sleep that night.
But paced my lonely cham-
ber half-demented.
Next day I called. Imagine
my delight
When /said "Will you
wed?" and she con-
sented.
Three weeks of most ecstatic
bliss were mine,
And then the seeming gold
proved worthless pewter.
The scales fell off my blinded
eyes. In fine,
She wrote to say she found
I didn't suit her!
"And so for both our sakes,
we part." My jaw
Fell when I read her note. Soon my dis-
traction
Came to an end. I flew from love to law,
And brought at once a breach of promise
action.
Retained on mv behalf were three Q.C.'s,
They ohe and all advised me naught could
save her,
For I should win the day with utmost ease,
And get a swinging verdict in my favour.
The day arrived. The Court was crowded
out
With dames who spend their time in never
missing
A cause cfli'bre, whilst perplexed with doubt
The Judge said; "'Kissing'—dear me,
what is ' kissing'?"
She wore a lovely gown of coloured silk,
A dream in dresses, and she smiled so
sweetly,
Whilst I confess that she knew how to bilk
My counsel in her answers most completely.
Well in the end of this forensic fight
My case alas! become a Sun and Stnr thing,
The jury gave me, not the Widow's Mite.
But you, my sweet, sad coin, the Maiden's
Farthing.

"OLD JOE AND YOUNG JOE."
Joe, Junior, explains Ihf Double-headed Parish-Disl rid trick to
audience a', the Unionist tizanee, Thursday, February
So when I look at you with eyes that fill
With tears that can't but come, in, out of i
season,
Remember, shameless BKI.I.A (with my Bill
Of costs) is just the real romantic reason!
MRS. R/ox ECCLESIASTICAL TITLES.—"I
see," observed our excellent friend, "that in
Daily Telegraph a correspondent has
the
been asking why a few of our clergymen call
themselves ' Fathers.' Well, as most clergy-
men of my acquaintance are married men
with small means and very large families, I
don'tseewhy they shouldn't be called just what
they are, and that is, 'Fathers.' It's much
more sensible than calling clergy 'Fathers'
who are not allowed to marry, and are bound
to remain what they call ' Silly-bits,' which
seems to me a foolish title."
MOST LIBERAL TEHMS!—The following ap-
peared in the Murning Post of Feb. 16:—
ABED-ROOM (first floor) for a Gentleman near
Victoria and Bclgnive Square; terms logs,
weekly, in advance; gas and boots inclusive;

DIARY OF AN EXTIN-
GUISHED PERSONAGE.
(Second Instalment.)
Preface,—This important
work may be fragmentary,
but for all that it is import-
ant. It is important, be-
cause it tells the story of a
most important personage.
I am the most important
personage, and I tell the
story. I not only tell this
story, but lots of others.
And: why do I this? Be-
cause I hate the brutal Eng-
lish. But hush! I must
dissemble. Some one comes.
Some one goes. I can re-
sume my writing. It was
the English General. He
declares that the next time
I hit a Sergeant-Major over
the head with an umbrella,
I shall receive a thrashing
myself! Oh the indignity!
But I must dissemble- nay,
I have dissembled. I have
said that I was egged on by
BAND rr- BEY to attack the
non-commissioned officer. I
have been forgiven this time,
but BANG UP BEY is to be
sent off about his business.
Well, I have consented to
the degradation of BANG rjp
BET. He is to cease to be
Lord Grand Sugar-Stick in
Waiting, but is to become
Prince of Mesopotamia, and
Knight Grand Cross of the
Emerald Bowstring. I have
done this, not to please BANG
rp BEY (who is rather an
ass), but to spite the English
General!
Later.—What is thisP
What do I hear through the
telephone? A celebrated
actor dares to "takemeoff!"
I have wired for an apology.
I hear that the piece lias been
altered. Good—very good!
1 have told the English Gen-
eral that if it occurs again 1
will turn every "red-coat"
out of the country. The barbaric warrior has
laughed, and says that if I do anything non-
sensical (nonsensical! ha! ha! but. a time will
come!) 1 shall be taken off the throne of mv
ancestors! I am foaming at the mouth witt
rage, but I have apologised!
Later still.—I have sent a note round to all
the Powers complaining of the treatment to
which I have been subjected. The English
General has called declaring that he won't
post my letters. What ho, my guards!
This is treason! The reply of the General is
to box my ears! I wish he wouldn't, he does
hit so hard!
Later yet.—My master at Constantinople
has wired to me "not to play the fool."
Disgraceful! However, my haughty spirit
is not to te crushed by threats. Havj de-
clared war against Europe!
Latest. — Boohoo! Boohoo!! Boohoo!!!
They have sent me to bed without my tea!
And I am told that if I am not a better boy
to-morrow I am to go back to school at
Vienna! Oh, boohoo! I am so unhappy!
Oh, boohoo! Boohoo!! Boo-boohoo !! f
A SOCIAL PROBLEM.—Which is the more
desirable to be, a worthless scamp or a

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

TOBY, M.P., IN THE TROPICS.
Ji.M.S. "Pembroke Castle." Madeira, Thursday.—Very par-
ticular to tell steward to call us this morning at six o'clock. Ship
due at that hour at Funchal. At 6.30 party arranged to go ashore
and see Madeira. Ship coaling. Notice given that all passengers
must be aboard by 9.30 A.M. Awakened at dead of night by uproar;
voices i ising high in unknown tongue; pitch-dark in cabin; put on
pyjamas and grope way on deck. Madeira lying a biscuit-throw off.
(Some ship's biscuits are hard
and will carry far.) A few
lights flash in white houses
by edge of the sea; beyond
what looks like a cloud and
might be a mountain.
Our lower deck a liabcl of
sound and a mass of wicker-
work tables, chairs, and
baskets, of all shapes and
sizes. Proprietors seated in
chairs, witn lantern in one
hand and cigarette in other.
All round the ship, boats
with more baskets, lanterns,
cigarettes, and men shout-
ing. Does not seem to be a
whisper in the Portuguese
tongue.
Chairs intended for sale to
passengers. No passengers
vet about; dealers apparent-
ly engaged in trying to sell
goods to each other.
Toby just off the Pint of Madeira. Got off for island half an
hour late; picked way through
fleet of chair-laden boats; one or two follow. Impossible to conceive
English jiassenger, just arrived, not wanting wicker-work chairs.
On tin- pier enthusiastic reception by the halt, the lame, the blind,
and the interpreters. These natives plainly thought if we hadn't
come to Madeira to buy chairs, must have come to see them, and
give them shillings. Gently tried to disillusionise them; no use;
followed us in triumphant procession to hotel; took kindly interest
in our ordering breakfast • saw us into the ox-carts which dragged
us up the steep, stony hill to roof of island. Nothing escaped the
blind man's_ eye. A gentleman exceptionally endowed with total
absence of fingers and thumbs persistently thrust the soiled stumps
under our nose, as if we had come to Madeira to smell them. As the
oxen tugged at the sledges, the procession tailed off; the blind man
lost sight of us; the lame gentleman ceased from running; the
thumbless citizen, thrusting his stumps into the sides of his trousers,
moodily strode off.
The rest of the population came out to see us pass. Men and
women curiously like natives of the West of Ireland. Having
lumbered to top of hill in the ox-drawn sledges, came down like
flash of lightning on other side of town, in sort of clothes-basket,
which glides at rollicking pace over smooth cobble-stones, a sturdy
Galway peasant guiding and restraining it by ropes attached to front
of basket. Pleasant the air on these lofty heights. On journey
down we flash by red and white walls overgrown with roses, helio-
trope, and cyclamen, with oranges gleaming in the groves, and
bananas peeping up from every garden.
Half way down men suddenly pull up, and explain that they are
"going to have a drink." A pleasant halting-place, with the sea
below and the soft air scented with heliotrope. Even under rule of
Portugal Madeira is free. If a man would drink the wine of his
native country who shall say him nay? So we sit and wait their
pleasure, thankful to be delivered from our body-guard down in the
town.
After a while woman comes out with tray which she hands round;
we say "no " ; we do not care about taking wine at this early hour;
she remonstrates; argues; entreats; grows angry; goes away • comes
back with interpreter. He explains she wants ze momsn." It
appears that our light-hearted porters, having invited themselves
to take refreshment, we have to pay for it.
This we do, and dash on again, pulling up at door of hotel, nearly
running over the lame gentleman, causing the blind man to skip
out of the way with amazing alacrity, and convulsing our finger-
less friend with joy at seeing us once again. To them enter lour
more interpreters (who loudly ordered everybody about in our
interest), a boy leading the opposition blind man, and a voluble bald
man who sold canaries. Three shillings each they were if taken
singly; but if the whole lot were purchased, he would sacrifice
everything and let them (jo for " ten schelling."
Boy who led the opposition blind man wifl be heard of later in
life. Finding no one would give him sixpence he produced six
pennyworth of coppers and blandly offered change to gentlemen
whose charitable impulses might be hampered by not having any.
This was a deal which, if effected, would have made two profits,
English copper is a drug in the Madeira market; shop-keepers wil-
lingly give thirteen pence for a silver shilling.
Young Shylock would have made a halfpenny on exchange in
addition to the eleemosynary copiers handed to him.
After breakfast found our friends, the lame, the halt, and the
blind, fresher than ever, awaiting us. Escorted us to boat, and
saw us embark, with kindliest expression of regret at our too brief
stay in their beautiful island. The fingerless gentleman wanted to
shake hands; pretended not to see the friendly advance, and, nod-
ding to the blind man, stepped into the boat, the men refusing to
put off till we had paid our fare.
"TRYING A MAGISTRATE."
[The Board of Trade have been for four months "considering" the request
of the Magistrate at Marylcbone Police Court to be furnished with a pedo-
meter (for measuring cab-fare distances), in place of an old and useless one.
The following is a page from a Blue-book that may be presented to Parlia-
ment—some day. It bears evidence of being a Kcport of a Departmental
Sub-Committee.]
Utility of
Pedometers:
the evidence
taken.
Unusual
expedition
shown.
Attempts to
get the cost of
a new Machine
out of other
Public Bodies.
Replies of
the County
Council and
the School
Board.
Evidence of Land-Surveyors, Instrument-makers,
Mechanical Experts, Cvclists, Umpires at Pedestrian
Contests, and other autnorities who might be expected
to know something about the subject, was next taken
as to the general construction of Pedometers.
Owing to the unexampled expedition with which
youi Sub-Committee conducted this important branch
of the inquiry, only one year and six months was
taken up in the examination of witnesses, whose evi-
dence will be found in pages 575 to 2864 of this
Report.
The efforts of your Sub-Committee were naturally
directed at an early period to the question of whether
the cost of obtaining a Pedometer for the Marylebone
Police Court could not be debited to any other Public
Department or Body. It appeared that on this sug-
gestion having been made to the learned Magistrate,
he had put himself in communication, successively,
with the London County Council, the London School
Board, the City Corporation, some of the Vestries, the
Charity Organisation Society, the Ragged School
Committee, the Soup Kitchen Association, and private
philanthropists. The replies of these bodies and
individuals will be found in Appendix B, and affords,
the Sub-Committee believes, some reading of quite
unique interest.
It will be seen that the London County Council
offered to purchase a second-hand Pedometer for the
Court "on condition that it was only worked for
eight hours a day, and that every person residing in
any street which had to be measured should have an
extra penny put on to his rates." The London School
Board took up the position that, though a Pedometer
might be described as an educational instrument, they
would not be justified in paying for one "unless the
maker were certified bv an Archbishop and at least
three Bishops to be able to repeat the Thirty-nine
Articles backwards without a mistake."
TO A YOUNG LADY.
( With a Box of
SWEETS to the sweet — that is I fear an old
Remark to make to one so young as you are,
Would that this box were worth its weight in gold
To be a gift worth giving you, which few are.
Some marrons glaces, chestnuts, sugared ioe,
In this small box are delicately placd.
My jokes are sometimes chestnuts — not so nice —
And yet you laugh at them, you 're never glacte.

admitted Knight of the Order of the Garter, like a canary in a bird-

THANKS, Canon BODY! In th

"THE EOGS OF THE GREAT
AUK."—The meagre result of

A SHACONIAN FYTTE.
ACCORDING to a Detroit investigator, not only did BACON write
"SHAKSPEARE," but also BURTON'S Anatomy of Melancholy, and all
the other Elizabethan literature. However, the Hanwell Professor of
Acrostics has gone several better. He sends the following :—
Eureka! Bravo! and
Hooray! I 've un-
ravelled
The secret that sages for
ages has gravelled!
Aha and oho! I 've dis-
covered the key,
That none of your
sphinxes or lynxes
could see!
Yes, the cryptogram
mystic I solved in a
minute!
Good gracious, IUNATIUS
DONNELLY'snot in it!
And " BACON " I 've found for all names you must write,
That for B-C-N would make an acrostical "light."
What need to explain? 'twere an act of presumption—
My facts a child may know (cum grano of gumption !)
These authors are merely (their number's immense)
Ignoramuses, famous at BACON'S expense!
For BACON wrote BYRON and BITFON and BUNYAN,
BJOR.VSON, BEN JONSON (he could be a funny 'un!);
While Dodo by " BENSON " his lordship may claim,
And the Classics of BOHN were all bohned from the same!
Of names meaning BACON I '11 give you a crack array,
There's MEREDITH, BLACKMOHE, CHARLES DICKENS and
THACKERAY,
VOL T

And I 've learnt hy a system of crosses and noughts
'Twas certainly BACON who wrote Happy Thoughts.
Yet more Verulamian cyphers I '11 add on:—
BUCHANAN, DICK BURTON, "Miss" BROUGHTON, "Miss"
BRADDON,
And Cookery-books, too, as " BEETON," he wrote
Why, these pseudonyms all simply BACON denote!
Nay, he nearly was " BROWNING," unless I 'm mistaken;
BKSANT, BURNS, and BLAKE, too, just missed being BACON!
I '11 swear he's the author of Sradshaw and Burke,
And, to end, all "ANON. " writes is really his work!
NAY! NAY!
HK IVENS! What is this we read in a sporting paper?
"The injury to Lady HALLE'S foot is rapidly mending, and her trainer
declares the tilly will be quite herself again in a short time."
How did this charming and distinguished lady damage her foot?
And why is it reserved for a sporting contemporary to publish the
intelligence? Is Lady HALL£ perchance a horse, that she should do
this thing? How irreverent (and inappropriate) to talk of her as a
tilly! Did she give a horse-laugh when she read about it? We
i pause for a reply. Was she playing excerpts from Le Chei-al de
Bronze or from Cu caller ia liusticana when she hurt herself? Please
answer quickly.
THE EARLY BIRD CATCHES THE WORM.—When M. BEHNAJID,

THE DEVIL'S LATEST WALK.
(A long way after Coleridge and Southey.)
"For Satan finds some mischief still
1'or idle hands to do."—Dr. WATTS.
FKOM his brimstone bed at break of day
A-walking the Devil is gone,
To stir up strife in his favourite'way,
And see how his work goes on.
Over the hill and over the dale
He went, and through swamp and scrub;
And backward and forward he swished his
long tail
As a golfer swishes his club.
And how then was the Devil clad?
Oh! he was dressed like a working lad,
With fustian jacket and corduroys stout,
And a hole behind where the tail came
out.
He saw poor Labour angry and blind,
And Capital proud though unstable •
And the Devil smiled, for it put him in
mind
Of the strife between CAIN and ABEL.
Down the river there plied, with wind and
tide,
A Strike-pig with great celerity.
And the Devil looked wise as he saw the
while
It cut its own throat. "There," quoth he,
with a smile,
"Goes'England's commercial prosperity!'"
He went through the City, he went through
the slum,
Spied flocks of fashion and troops preda-
cious;
And he saw that the suffering poor were
dumb,
And their parasites loquacious;
And he saw that some^from selfish choice,
And some from bitter need, were idle •
And he thought " I '11 lift up a lawless Voice
That the Law itself can't bridle."
So he went down into Trafalgar Square,
And perched by a I.andseer lion;
And he spouted loud to the gathering crowd
That he kept a sinister eye on.
He scanned their ranks, as they shambled
near,
With a cynic's critical scrutiny;
And he saw that some were loungers mere,
That some looked vicious, and some looked
drear,
While some 'neath the scourge of hunger and
fear
Were ripe for mischief and mutiny.
He saw that loafers with sodden lips,
And waifs with faces pallid;
Superfluous drudges from shops and ships;
Prowlers watching policedom's slips,
Law's mischances and Order's trips;
And sufferers true with starvation at grips,
To his audience all were rallied.
And he raised his voice and lifted his hand,
And he spouted—spouted—spouted!
Crass declamation that sounded grand.
Denunciations of Capital's band,
Of slavery rampant in Liberty's Land,
Sly appeals to the bomb and brand;
And the poor dupes nothing doubted
This " gent" so eloquent, fiery, bland.
With such warm love for the Horny Hand,
And though they could hardly half under-
stand,
They tossed their caps and shouted.
He stirred the poor to vain hope of good,
And the bad to fierce hope of evil.
With Satanic subtlety there he stood,
Appealing to every mind and mood.
And in half the hearts in his neighbourhood
He raised—the very Devil!
He left them girding at Order and Law,
And what was yet absurder,
Looking for Justice to empty Jaw,
Happiness in foul Anarchy's maw,
Rest 'neath the ravening tiger's paw,
And Brotherhood—in Murder I
• • • * •
The Devil unhitched his tail and went
And left his audience teeming
With simmering hate, blind discontent;
Left fiery hearts in a fierce ferment,
And fogged brains vaguely dreaming.
And he said with a grin on his sinister face,
"Fools love the Devil's oration!
Red revolt in their hearts will wake;
Idle hands will my death-tools take;
And if stolid Order I can but shake,
And move dull Law to the old mistake,
I rather fancy the town will quake
At streets as red as my own hot lake
And a general Conflagration."
"WHITE ME powx AN Ass."—The promi-
nent representative of National Liberalism in
the Reichstag is "Herr HASSE," and when-
ever he has to affix his signature to any docu-
ment he fulfils the Shakspearian dictum, and
"writes himself down a BASSE."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE IDEAL DEMOCRACY.
"I THINK you left directions that you were to be thawed in 1001
precisely?" said the stranger politely. "Allow me to introduce
myself—Number SEVEN MILLION AND Srx. If you feel equal to
the effort, and would care to see the vast improvements in our
social condition since the close of the benighted Nineteenth Century,
I shall be pleased to conduct you."
Mi: Punch then began to realise that he had had himself frozen
by a patent process just a hundred years ago, and that he had
returned to animation in time for the close of the marvellous
Twentieth Century; so he jprepared, in much curiosity and excite-
ment, to accompany his guide.
"By the way," observed the latter, "you must not be annoyed
if your—hem—habiliments, which we are unaccustomed to nowadays,
should attract some attention."
Singularly enough, Mr. Punch had just begun to feel a certain
embarrassment at the prospect of being seen in Piccadilly or Regent
Street in the company of a person attired in grey cellular pyjamas, a
drab blanket, and a glazed pot
hat. However, on reaching the
street, he found that every man
he met was similai-ly clad, while
his own costume—which, in his
original century, would only have
been remarkable for its unim-
peachable taste—was, in this, the
subject of universal and invidious
comment.
"You '11 have your regulation
pot hat and pvjamas served out
to you in time!" said Mr. SKVKX
MILLION AND Six encouragingly.
"Then no one will say anything
to you. In these days we resent
anything that tends to confer an
artificial distinction on any man.
Surnames for example, which
occasionally suggested superiority
of birth, have long been abolished,
and official numbers substituted.
You seem to be looking for some-
thing you do not see ?" he added,
noting a certain blankness and
disappointment in Mr. 1'unch's
expressive countenance.
I was only wondering why I
saw no signs of any new and mar-
vellous inventions at present,"
said Mr. Punch. "I rather
expected to see the air full of
electric trains, manageable bal-
loons, or coveys of citizens dart-
ing about on mechanical pinions.
But I see none, and even more
l>eople go on foot than in my own
time."
"Inventions, I take it," was
the reply, "only served to enrich
the Capitalist, and save time or
jabour. Now we have no Capital-
ists and no riches, and no reason
for hurrying anywhere, while it
would be absurd and useless to lessen the amount of manual labour'
when, even as it is, there is scarcely enough to keep everyone em-
ploved for six hours a day."
11 Why ar_> all the women I see dressed exactly alike in navy-blue
woollen frocks and coal-scuttle bonnets:"" Mr. Punch inquired
presently. "Surely they can't all be members of the Sal"
"A uniform costume was decreed by plebiscite some years ago,"
replied his mentor, promptly. "Any real equality amongst women
was found hopeless so long as some were able to render themselves
exceptionally attractive by a distinctive toilette."
"What!" exclaimed Mr. Punch, "did all the pretty women
consent to such a sacrifice''"
"They were in a very decided minority, even then," said Mr.
SEVEN ifiLLlox AND Six; "and it is not our way to think much of
minorities. At present, owing no doubt to an enactment which
penalised every pretty woman by compelling her to wear blue goggles
and a respirator, feminine beauty is practically extinct."
Mr. Punch could not restrain a sigh. They were now entering a
somewhat gloomy thoroughfare, between massive blocks of buildings,
with large doors and innumerable small windows, which towered
into the sky on either hand.
"I seem to miss the shop-fronts," he said aloud, " with their plate-
glass, and all their glitter and luxury. What has become of them all?"

"Such necessaries as the citizen requires^' said his companion,
"are procured at the Public Storehouses, which you see around you,
by the simple method of presenting a ticket. The luxuries you refer
to were only procurable by the rich, and nolwdy is rich now. If you
will come with me, I will take you over one of the State Dwelling-
houses, and show you one of the suites of rooms. Every citizen has
a room; or, if married, a couple of rooms, exactly the same shape
and size as those of his fellows. . . . Beautifully clean, you seej " he
remarked, complacently, as he threw open one of the doors. "Neat
whitewashed walls, plain deal furniture, nice holland blinds—what
more can any reasonable citizen want in the way of comfort?"
"There used to be a celebrated poet in my time," said Mr. Punch,
with some hesitation, "who designed and sold very beautiful
upholstery—tapestry, -wall-papers, curtains, and so on. I fancy hi'
held Socialistic views. But I see no trace of his work A<re."
"I think I know whom you refer to." was the reply. "The com-
munity would doubtless have been glad of his services if he would
only have contracted to supply every citizen with precisely the same
pattern and quality of Ids manufactures at, say, a pork-pie a yard.
But, for some reason, he could
not see his way to it, and the in-
dustry declined; which is not
to be regretted, for it certainly
tended to foster individualism."
"It is curious," said Mr.
Punch, when they were outside
again, "that I have not as yet
seen a single policeman."
"Not at all curious. We hare
none. Crime simply proceeded
from the galling sense of social
inequality. Consequently, as soon
as that was removed, Justice,
with all its machinery, became
an anachronism."
"I think," said Mr. Punch,
presently, "I should like to take
a stroll in Hyde Park."
"That," said his guide, "has
not been ]x>ssible for at least fifty
years. All the parks are now cut
up into three-acre allotments,
where every able-bodied citizen
does an hour's compulsory spade-
work once a fortnight. A most
admirable reform, as you will
agree!"
"Capital! " gasped Mr. Punch,
with an anticipatory pain in his
back. "Then I am curious to see
what strides have been made by
•=- w your modern painters. Could you
take me to a picture-gallery?"
"There are wo modern painters.
It is perhaps a pity—but quite
iinavoulable. It was an obvious
injustice that, when all citizens
had to perform their share of more
or less distasteful manual labour,
there should be any one class that
earned a living bv work in which
hours' stone-breaking or brick-making, or what not, as an ante-
cedent condition of being permitted to paint at all, and naturally
the State declined to provide him with paints and brushes at the
expense of the community. A few artists persisted for a while,
from sheer love of the thing ; but as no picture fetched more than a
pound of sausages, and the average price was a bowl of porridge,
they found it expedient to turn to some more useful occupation.
And it is undeniable that they contribute more to the resources of
the commonwealth by wielding a trowel or a broom than by messing
about with brushes and paint. As a concession to hereditary
instinct, however, their descendants ore still set apart as State
whitewashes."
"And the Drama?" Mr. Punch inquired next, "How is Unit
getting on? Has the New Dramatist made his appearance at last':"
"On the contrary, I am glad to say he has disappeared—let us
hope for ever. For the essence of Drama, as I understand, was
Emotion—Passion, Jealousy, Marital and Parental relations, and so
on. Now that marriages are the subject of State regulation, and
extend only for a limited period, Passion, of course, is obsolete:
Jealousy, too, is recognised as merely Selfishness in disguise, and
we have grown too altruistic to desire the exclusive possession of
anything. While, as the offspring of every union are removed at
birth to a communal crfcfie, and brought up and educated by the

"Just so. Fiction depended on Contrast. "When everybody is on
precisely the same level, the novelist is, happily, unnecessary. What

"1 was wondering1 if I could buv an evening paper anywhere,"

"Of course. Everyone is so contentedly and peacefully absorbed

to read about the doings of other personSj even if there was any-
thing of interest to be told, which there isn't. We produce just
sufficient for our own wants, so there is no commerce; we have no
Army or Navy, since we don't desire to conquer, and are not worth
conquering. No Politics, because we govern ourselves by our own
consent and co-operation; no Science, as inventors only benefited
capital at the expense of labour; and, this being so, what is there

"I used to do a little in that way once."
"You had better not do it here. Humour, I believe, consisted in
representing Humanity under ridiculous aspects. We 're Humanity,
and we don't see any fun in being laughed at. None of your
humour here, mind!"
"But the citizens have a certain amount of leisure, I suppose,"
said Mr. Punch. "How do they amuse themselves.'' For I can
discover no libraries, no circuses, nor concert-rooms, nor anything!"
"It was seen to be invidious to furnish any entertainment at the
public expense which did not give equal amusement to all, and so
the idea was gradually dropped. When our citizens have finished
their daily task, they find their relaxation, in the intervals of eating
and sleeping, in the harmless and soothing practice o:
They can all do that, and the State provides each

have now no objection to taking up work in the "ft. B. D.," the
Chancery side, or even dabbling, so to speak, in Probate, Divorce and
Admiralty. In the latter Division I have long desired to appear, as I
have wished for an opportunity of suggesting to the presiding Judge
and the assessor from the Trinity House that I am all at sea," and
consequently well fitted to deal with matters connected with our
marine. In the courts over which Mr. Justices CIIITTT, ROMER and
NORTH (not to mention other ermine-wearers of equal eminence)
preside it is not necessary to study posture, to any great extent. As
a rule, counsel who appear in an administration suit are satisfied to
adopt a colloquial tone, and rather neglect the graceful attitudes
suggested by the statues of CORDOVA. It has not been my good for-
tune to appear very frequently in the Chancery Courts, and therefore
I have not adopted manv poses for the somewhat rare occasions to
which I have alluded. To all intents and purposes, when I have con-
sented to the appointment of a receiver, or asked (in the absence of
my leader) that such and such a case may be "mentioned" on such
and such a day, I have found that a more or less faithful reproduc-
tion of the pose of the Apollo Belvidere has been sufficient to obtain
the goodwill of the Bench, the silent respect of the Bar, and the
murmured admiration of the public in the gallery. The attitude is
not a difficult one to master, especially if you strengthen your brief
by giving greater stability to the bundle by the introduction of a
stray copy of the Athentfum.
But the decision in the matter of the Living Pictures is of the
greatest importance to Counsel appearing at the Royal Courts before
a jury, or attending the proceedings at the Old Bailey. At the
Central Criminal Court an attitude is almost everything, and a
barrister who thoroughly knows his work will never do full justice
to his client's interests unless he can during the course of his address
suggest a perfect gallery of noble statuary. If he has to abuse his

A REAL LIVELIHOOD FROM LIVING PICTURES.
(An Appeal from thf Bar to the Public.)
PERSONAL advertisement is one of the curses of the last decade of
the nineteenth century, and it has no greater opponent than myself.
Consequently, I am loth to attach my signature to any opinions save
those forwarded in the customary
course to my clients the solici-
tors. Of late (during the last
twenty years or so) those profes-
sional opinions have been few and
far between. It seems that the
Public prefer to be guided b;
their own untrained will, am
shrink from asking advice at the
hands, or rather the pen, of an
expert. Still, when the Bar of
England is expected to speak, I
think I shall ever be ready to be
the spokesman. Fortunately, too,
there is no difficulty in deciding
the proper place for the publica-
tion of the Bar's opinion. For
more than half a century the
pages of Punch have been recog-
nised by the Bench as the only
legitimate columns sa<red to the
support of Justice in all its
branches. I consequently think
it my duty—merely as the mouth-
piece of the profession to which I have the honour to belong—to
offer my sincere congratulation to the universe at large, and that
particular part and parcel of it known as the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Ireland, on the result of the recent litigation con-
cerning the copyright of Tableaux Vivanls, or, to come to our dear
old English vernacular, Licing Pictures.
During the argument upon this knotty point, it was suggested
that the Lords Justices in the Court of Appeal might, by assuming
certain postures already used by an artist of considerable eminence,
lay themselves open to the charge of an infringement of copyright.
Had this point been conceded it would have been almost impossible
to estimate the damage there would have been done to those who
practise in the Divisions appropriated to Nisi Prius. Since the
merging of Equity with Law I have extended my own practice, and

of the masterpieces of antiquity.
But to move a step in advance of this contention. A short while
ago I called attention, in the name of the legal profession, to a valu-
able suggestion thrown out by the Editor of the Times newspaper,
that in future lectures should be popularised. With the purpose of
developing this most admirable proposal, I reported an imaginary
Address that might be delivered in the Hall of Gray's Inn. The
Address to which I now refer was, if my scheme were accepted, to be
illustrated with dissolving views; and when I made the proposal, of
course I had in my mind the wealth of material ready to hand in our
picture-galleries. Deprive the lecturer of that material, and his
powers of illustration would be poor indeed. No doubt portraits of the
Judges shown on a disc would be received with respect, but they
would become monotonous unless relieved by such stirring tableaux
as " King JOHN signing Magna Charta," or " The Forcible Suppres-
sion of Grand Sergeanty." I fail to sea how it would be possible to
adequately depict the renowned " rule in Shelley's Case," unless
recourse were had to the portfolios of MICHAEL AXGELO and his
predecessors in the work of the studio.
Under all these circumstances I venture to submit that the de-
cision in the matter of the Liring Pictures has been of enormous
benefit to the Bench, the Bar, and the Public. Fond _as I am,
from a professional point of view,
that decision will not be reversed. True,
to those who are dissatisfied
Courts; but in this instance
, of litigation, I can only hope that
. True, the House of Lords is open

I trust the case may be left in its
existing position. Practically. Mr. Punch is one of the best of our
Judges, and I earnestly pray that, should such an appeal be brought
before him, that he will support the decision already reached, and
frown upon any proposition to disturb it. '°~' n

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
ANY new work by the author of Timothy's
Quest is assured of a circle of charmed
readers on both sides of the Atlantic. Poll if
(Hirer's Problem, Mrs. WH;(;IN'S last book
(GAY AM» BIBI>), is marked by that whole-
some bree/iness of tone, quiet humour and
dainty style which have sent her earlier work
into a fifth edition.
In the publication of TIIIKRS'S History of
the Consulate anil the Umpire of France.
Messrs. CIIATTO AND Wrxnrs have embarked
upon one of the most attractive and impor-
tant literary undertakings of the year. My
Baronet has a cherished recollection of boy-
hood, when the work, then fresh from the
hand of the author, reposed on a certain library
shelf, in twenty solid volumes, a romance
enchanting beyond all contemporary fiction.
The new edition, admirably translated by
Mr. FORBES CAMPBELL and Mr. JOHN STEE-
RING, will be completed in twelve volumes.
The first, portable and well printed, brings
the moving story from the date of the 18th
lirumaire (Nov. !>, 17110) to the month of Ger-
minal, year VIII. of what was still nomin-
ally the French Republic. Within the space
of eighteen months we see NAPOLEON at his
marvellous best, still young and slim, victor
at Marengo, master of Italy, dictator on the
Continent, baulked only by England, with
whom, as the volume closes, he, under cover
of a transitory peace, is preparing for a deadly
struggle.
My Child and 7, by FLORENCE WARDEN,
is a story that you may take up in a hurry,
but which you will not be able to put down
as quickly as you took it up. Look at the
clock! "I'll just read one more chapter."
you'll say, " to see what happens to so-and-
<o"—the Baron will not disclose the secrets
of the three volumes by breathing one single
name—and then, having finished the chapter
in less time than you had expected, you will
i?ive yourself "just five minutes" to dip into
another. You '11 dip, and dip, and dip, until,
perhaps, unless vour study be gas-lit or
electric-lit, you will have expended the mid-
night oil and wax, and be reduced to "a
I dip," if such a thing can be found in the
house. An imperious voice will be saying to
you, "You don't leave the room till you
have finished that" and even an imaginary
finger will point to the third volume. An
occasional helping of spiced brawn refreshes
the literary palate, and is good for the lite-
rary digestion; and FLORENCE WARDEN'S
My Child and I will both tickle the taste,
and satisfy the appetite. For ladies I should,
says the Baron, recommend it, if you 'ye been
out for a good walk after lunch, with five
o'clock tea, as it will occupy you till dinner-
time; but for the men, the Baron would say,
await the retiring hour after dinner, /hot re
lie ichisJty et du tabor, and then take My
Child and Me (to be grammatical) on your
knee, and enjoy it till your eyes close, and
the demand for " the downy" is imperative.
That this is the way to enjoy a novel is the
boldly expressed opinion of the unselfish

THE STAGE MARITIME
MURDER.
OH, loud roars the metal thunder!
Oh, tierce blows the beastly
draught,
Careering around and under
The waves and the rocking raft!
But now, though, the waters
simmer,
And now, though, they light
the moon,
Which says with its greenish
glimmer
That murder will happen soon!
And then, there's the tremb-
ling tune,
The tune that gets dimmer and
dimmer and dimmer
Till it sinks right away in a
swoon!
Yes, I know that theatrical
tune,
And! know that theatrical moon,
Which invariably cometh too
soon,
Ere the gasman can trim her!
The raft is a creaking lumber
Of curious logs of wood;
The persons upon it number
Just two, as they always should
When tunes arc ajfettuoso,
And murder is in the air!
When fiddles begin to go so,
A corpse is as good as there!
The men make a grisly pair,
Their cheeks being smudged with
the paint of starvation,
And their eyes being fixed in a
stare,
In a rather remarkable glare,
Which you never see anyone
wear
Save in this situation.
Oh, why are the fiddles fainter?
Oh, why is the drumming o'er?
Oh, why are the moonbeams
quainter
Than ever they were before?
Oh, why—but I see the notion:
The reason for all is plain;
The murder is now in motion—
The victim is in the main!
Is struggling with might and
mam!—
Is kicking and making a fearful
commotion
In the dusty and faint-smelling
main!
But he struggles and struggles
in vain,

best (as you will) of this re-arrangement is that the Leveret is so
uncommonly like the old Hare, that HARE pere, as to allow small
chance to those who have seen Caste with the original cast of forget-
ting the old Jeremiah as they see before them the young Jeremiah,
and consequently uttering a jeremiad. On the other hand, those who
see this C'atte for the first time are immensely pleased with HARE
minor; but even these; being aoquaint«d with other performances of
HARE major, and having been told that this is HARE major's part,
cannot be quite unprejudiced, much as they may enjoy the per-
formance of HARE minor. This may be mere Hare-splitting, but, if
it is so, who began it? Why, the Management,—whatever that term
may mean,—at the Garrick.
FORBES ROBERTSON is excellent; he is a thoroughly manly George
d'Alroy. But poor Mr. ABINODON cannot keep BANCROFT out of the
part, very much as the well-intentioned Mr. Dick could not, for the
life of him, exclude King CHARLES'S Head from his Memorial. And
if ABINODON cannot forget BANCROFT, how much less can it be
expected of an audience who know the idiosyncracies of that actor by
heart f Miss KATE RORKE is most interesting as Esther; but Miss
MAY HARVEY is inclined to over-act Polly Eccles; she is, however,
very good, and at her very best in the last Act, which would cover
a multitude of faults, even if there were a multitude to cover.
There cannot be, and could never have been, a better Marquise than
Miss ROSE LECLEHCQ, who is La Marquise nu bout des angles, a typi-
cal foolish feminine aristocrat. The piece is all very charming and
very pretty, but it has become old-fashioned, yet not so sufficiently
old-fashioned as to make it a study of a period. A JUNIOR 0. P.

TOBY, M.P., IN THE TROPICS.
R.M.X. "Pembnike Castle." Saturday.—Under the Southern
Cross. The sun is shining out of a blue sky. A warm west wind
is blowing; half a mile to leeward a school of whales puffing and
blowing-, as if the water were insupportably hot. Since we left
Madeira we have been sailing on a summer sea, lightly rippled by a
breeze that one night, blowing off Cape de Verde, Drought a
strong smell of seaweed, though no land was visible.
Conversation quite easy now; but no such desire to indulge in
it as was displayed when the rollers of the Bay of .Biscay made it
impossible. Quite enough to sit about the deck, read and smoke.
We have come unto a land where it is always afternoon. Realise
the languor of the lotus-eater. Our world is bounded by a
horizon five miles distant, whichever way we look. For us the
while this is all the world, and we have it to ourselves—we and
the whales. For more than a day after we left Madeira a flock of
sea-gulls followed us, swooping restless and tireless in our wake.
They have deserted xis, gone back to Madeira, or, peradventure,
called in to moult a friendly feather on acquaintance^ at Cape de
Verde. Twice a ship, homeward bound, has passed us by on the
other side, apparently fearful of breaking in ui>on our solitude.
• '-.,-.-, The scene, fair all day, is fairest at
night, when the wind falls, and a
sultry yet fresh air, born in Africa,
whose continent we skirt, floats
over the ship.
Last night as darkness fell our
pathway was lighted on the one
side by the setting sun, on the
other by the rising moon. Later
the stars came out, their sheen
reflected like diamond points upon
the glassy sea. Night follows
night, each resembling the other
in quietness and beauty. After
dinner this evening we had a con-
cert in the saloon, at which pas-
sengers from other parts of the
ship looked in. Afterwards on
deck, listening to the bells sound-
ing the swiftly passing hours, with
the answering All's well" sung
by the man on watch in the distant
bows.
T/ntrsdai/.—Astride the Kqua-
Toby Crossing the Line. tor- Crossed the Line at ten o'clock
this morning. Would not have known it if Captain hadn't men-
tioned circumstance. Anyone could have done it, as dear old JOHNNY
TOOLE used to say. When its over thiuk no more of it than when
you've crossed Piccadilly. Not nearly so dangerous. SARK says he
felt slight shock as if we touched it. That is his imagination, which
is always active.
Thermometer on deck marks 81°. Spend day in truly British
fashion. After luncheon played cricket. After dinner had a ball on
lower deck. Ball-room covered in by awning open at sides to wind
blowing in from Atlantic. Still a tnfle hot for the exercise.
Getting a little anxious about Father MULLIXOAR. Evil commu-
nications are having proverbial effect. He is, so to speak, growing
a little tropical. First noticed him coming down Channel from
Southampton. His presence seemed to east a peaceful balm over the
ship, its busy crew and its multitudinous passengers setting forth
on a long voyage. SABK looking upon him began softly to whistle
"Fur those in tieril on the .SV'rt." Like another great man, Father
MULT.IXUAK is little but 'e's wise." Benignantly wise he seemed
as he stood with folded hands surviving through gold-rimmed
spectacles the bustling scene on deck. The sombreness of his cleric-
ally cut black suit was solely lightened by a deep band of linen tied
across his throat, serving the part of an ordinary collar. On his
head was a black silk cap with here and there a tint of purple,
presaging the cardinalate to which faithful service would even-
tually bring him. It was said that he had served man and the
Church in all the wilds of the earth. Had been partly burned by the
Sioux in the backwoods of Canada; had dined on sperm oil witfi the
Esquimaux; had been buried up to his neck by unbelievers in
Central Africa; and had for an hour and twenty minutes been used
as a target by a Zulu horde.
These things may bo true. I can personally vouch for fact that on
morning after we left Madeira 1 saw Father MuLLiNOAitstanding at the
bar drinking a cock-tail before breakfast. He explained that lie had
never tasted one before, which may account for the unusual hour.
Next morning passing smoke-room where TENNYSON used to read
Jfaiid to Mr. G. received another shock. Caught a glimpse behind
a hand of cards of pair of eyes twinkling through gold spectacles.
It was Father MrLLlNGAE joining a hand at whist. He played it
badly too.

"Ah," said he apologetically; "you should see me play euchre.
That's my game."
This afternoon he appeared on the cricket field got up in pair of
ducks, with white flannel shirt tied round the waist by bandana
neatly coloured in violet and vermillion. In place of his clerical
white collar shone a red and yellow kerchief of the kind dear to the
heart of the costcrmonger out for a Sunday afternoon. On his feet
were a pair of pumps with neat bow of ribbon tied over instep. The
good Father pointedly called attention to these by a habit, contracted
in some foreign parts, of lifting up a foot when the ball was
delivered and standing on one leg to bat. This, he savs, diminishes
the risk from a ball a little off the wicket delivered with undue
swiftness. Still like Jiobsof RUDYARD KIPLING'S fancy, " e 's a terror
for 'is size," is Father MTLLIKOAH. He's bound on mission service
for New Zealand, and being in good hands on board this ship, he'll
be able to teach the natives a thing or two when he arrives.
Saturday.—Off St. Helena, but cannot see it, because, like the
Spanish fleet, it is not yet in sight. Hear a pretty story about
the famous picnic trip. After luncheon at Copenhagen, it was
suggested that TENNYSON should follow his custom of an after-
noon, and read aloud from his poems. Poet Laureate usually
had seated next to him the young lady of the party, and had
formed pleasing habit of holding her hand with fatherly affection
whilst he declaimed favourite passages from his works. In the
arrangement of guests and visitors in smoking-room after the
Copenhagen lunch, the PRINCESS OF WALES chanced to sit on TENNY-
SON'S left, in place usually occupied by the other young lady.
TENNYSON read Mauri. As" he proceeded, losing himself, as usual,
in the intensity of the poem, the other guests were horrified to
observe his left hand fall into its accustomed position, and seize
(hat of his companion on his left. H.R.H. smiled, and left her hand
passive in the poet's vigorous grasp, where it was held till the
reading was finished. [N.B. This (by exception) is a true story.]
Capetown, Monday,—You remember HORACE'S Her ad Brttn-
flisiiim, an account of his travels through Greece, on his way to visit
the famous Brundisium'? He gives much detail of the journey;
tells how bad was the water he h:id to drink, and how he used to
anoint Ms weak eyes. A single line of the narrative, and that the
last, is given to Brundisium. "Here," he writes (I quote from
memory. No HORACE in ship's library), "ends my journey and my
stock of writing materials."
Shall follow in my Itur ad ('apiniin an illustrious example, by
writing nothing about Capetown. This for clivers reasons. First, T
shall be back almost as soon as this reaches you, and will tell you all
about it. Next, I am straightway going up country to meet Lo
BENGULA. I have a message and a parcel for him. When SAGE
OF QUEEN ANNE'S GATF, heard I was going to South Africa, he came
bearing a blanket and a parcel of tracts, which he begged me to
bestow on Lo BEN. should I come upon him by the wayside, evicted
without compensation.
"I would," said the good man, brushing away a tear, "have
added a rifle and a bottle of rum. But I do not like ostentatiously
to place myself in competition with agencies of older standing for
the spread of civilisation."
BRAVO CAMBRIDGE!
[Cambridge boat Oxford at Association Football, February 21.]
BUAVE boys, you beat the odds and Oxford too;
A feather this in football-cajps for you.
Cambridge may fail, and things go hugger-mugger,
When meeting Oxford at the game called " Rugger."
Yet who henceforth shall rashly dare to mock her
When with great Oxford shins are crossed at "Soccer"?
From eulogistic and exhaustless firkins
Shall streams of Cambridge butter flow for PERKINS,
Who boldly faced the cloud-compelling FHY,
And, shooting well and wisely, wiped his eye.
Tell me who better challenges comparison
With classic heroes than the dauntless HARRISON,
Who, when the ball came near him, never missed it,
Withstanding Oxford charges while he " fisted."
0 keen to charge and skilful to defend,
Accept, ye brave, three cheers from Punch, your friend.

"MrSoozie! MyToozie! MySoozie!"
It is the voice of a man, and he sings. Ho has grey eyes, and
wears a grey Norfolk-broad. They accentuate one another; the
pine-trees also accentuate his fishing-rod. His hum blends with
the bleating of the Hufo rulgaris and the cooing of Coleoptera.
Beside a fallen pine lies a woman (genus, in fact, muliebre).
"Where the tree fell
there she lies. Her
fresh animal in-
stinct sniffs the
music-hall refrain;
the footlights of the
Pavilion llouge mix
rather weirdly with
a vision, just rude-
ly interrupted, of
terra-cottas from
Tanagra. Not every
woman thinks of
these things in a
wood.
The male is a stu-
dent of the Eternal
Femininity. Al-
ready, while still
out of gunshot, he
has noticed her
wedding-ring and
1 he diamond keeper.
"Talking of keep-
ers," he begins,
with the affected
drawl now suffi-
ciently familiar to
the reader,'' are we
trespassing here?"
She replies in her
frank unembar-
rassedway. "Better
ask a p'leeceman,"
she says. (A lady,
obviously! Worth
cultivating? B et
your braces!)
'' After trout, you
Any local tips in flies?" A rare smile comes with her ready
answer. "'Pick-me-ups' after a heavy night- 'Henry Clays' after
lunch; 'spotted cocktails' for the evening. Like a'coachman'my-
self; sometimes find them quite killing !" Happy coachman!"
A chill comes over the sylvan scene with these reckless words
She has gathered her cream-coloured mittens about her wrists; the
contrast at once strikes him- in the subdued evening light he can
see that her hands are unwashed. She bows coolly, and is off across
the stream like a water-snake.

Shi1 is lounging nervously on the edge of the parlour-grate. There
are two (an acute observer would say three) furrows on her forehead.
"Off your pipe, old chappie? Feel a bit cheap?" (It is her husband
who speaks in this way.) "Yes, beastly, thanks, old man!"
"Try a nip o' whiskey. No soda; soda for boys. There, that's
right! Buck up! What's your book?" "Oh! one of WILDE'S
littb things. I like WILDE; he shocks the middle classes. Only
the middle classes are so easily shocked!" He smiles a gentle, dull
smile. There is a long pau«e; he cannot follow her swift eternally
feminine fancy. "What's it now, old buffer? A brass for your
thoughts!" ''I was thinking, little woman, of a filly foal I once
had. She grew up to be a mare. I never would have let anyone on
God's beautiful earth ride her." "I 'd have ridden her!" "No,
you wouldn't!" "Yes, I would!" (passionately and concen-j
tratedly). "Well, I sold her anvway. Lucky the beast isn't here:
now to spoil our conjugal unity!" The crisis had past. Another
moment and she might have left him for ever lonely and forlorn!
But in a twinkling her wild, free instinet doubles at a tangent.
With a supple bound she is on his shoulders curling her lithe fish-
ing boots into one of his waistcoat pockets. Surely gipsy blood runs
in her veins!
"Oh! I wish 1 were a devil" (it is the lady speaking); "yes, a
d-e-v-i-1!" "But you are, old woman, you are! and such a dear
little devil!" "Say it again, old man!" (kiss-ing him fiercely in
the left eye and worrying his ear like a ferret), " I love to hear you

know.
call me that. We women yearn for praise!" "You're a rare
brick, old dear ; and you 're never jealous. Look at that photo of the
other girl' Some women would have cut up rough about it. But
you—why, you sent her a quid when she was peckish, and she
chewed it for a week! Was there ever such a little chip?"

A Soxo OF SWELL "KLEPTOMANIA."

I KNEW by her hair which so cunningly curled
About her keen face, the Shoplifter was near;
And I said, " If there s innocence found in this world
A shopkeeper simple might look for it here."
It was noon, and on seats that were scattered around
Gaily chatting reposed each fair shopping swell she;
Her face seemed at rest, and she made not a sound,
This Shoplifter " nicking " when no eye could see.
And " Here in this sumptuous store," I exclaimed,
"Sits this maid who is lovely, at least to the eye;
She would storm if I charged her, and blush if I'blamed,
And swear that before being searched she would die."
Yet within her back pocket her hand as it dips
Deposits the " swag," this she-SiKEs fair and fine;
And I know, when arrested, those innocent lips
Will swear that those trinkets are hers, which are mine.
Chorus:—
Yet she smiles there, at rest, and she makes not a sound,
This Shoplifter " nicking" when no eye may see.
OUE BOOKING-OFFICE.
THE liaron has been much in-
terested inMr. NORMAN LOCKYER'S
Dawn of Astrnnumy. published
by CASSELL. The gods, whether
star-gods, or sun-gods, or any-
other gods, seem to have been
invented pictorially bv the same
kind of inspired talent that painted
"The Faithful Servant" on the
wall of a cloister in Winchester
College. There is no doubt what-
ever that the Egyptian Sun-day
was observed as strietly or even
more so than our Sunday is now-
a-days; but whether all the shops
were shut, and the taverns open
only at certain hours, as in Eng-
land, or whether the Egyptian
Sun-day was kept (or not kept, in
a Sabbatarian sense) as it is pretty
generally abroad, the observant
astronomer LOCKYEK is unable to
inform us. The chapter about
Isis and Horus is most interesting,
and specially at this time, when a
symbolically-inclined Oxonian ar-
tist might represent Isis as nursing
the Eight,—symbolised by a fifrure
of Oarus instead of Horus,—pre-
paratory to the aquatic contest Ancient Egyptian Sfatue, appropriate
between the two Lmversities. - •* "-V-- "-• •-- *£..*„

PREHISTORIC PEEPS.
"COACHING" FROM THE BANK WAS NO SINECURE EVEN IN THOSE DAYS. (THE
FEW DATS TO THE RACE !)
"EIGHT" ALL SIXES AND SEVENS—AND ONLY A
AMALGAMATION.
[" The County Council observes that there are two ways of amalgamating
the City and the County of London—by extending the boundaries of the City
until it becomes co-extensive with the County, and reforming the constitu-
tion while preserving the identity of the Corporation, and by creating a new
Corporation for the whole County, into which the existing Corporation and
County Council shall be absorbed. Not unnaturally, the second way is the
one chosen by the County Council, though some will find it difficult to recog-
nise the new Corporation as anything but the old County Council swollen by
the deglutition of the Citv."— The " Times" on the draft proposals of the
London County Council for the amalgamation of the City and County of
London.]

Ain't its tail sufficient curly? Gr-r-r! It makes me shudder

THE VERY LATEST THEORY ABOUT SHAKSPEARE.—Mr. LECKY,
speaking at the recent banquet in honour of Baron VAN GOLTSTETN,
suggested that SHAKSPEARE might have been inspired by CATS. We
think that the Daily Telegraph, in putting it " cats." has stumbled
upon the truth. Of course, SHAKSPEARE'S having derived inspira-
tion from cats accounts perfectly for the fact that throughout his
works he has not a single good word for dogs. We reo.uire a little
more time to think over the connection between cats' nine lives and
SHAKSPEAHE'S immortality.

by Mr. GUTHRIE in his inimitably humorous romance of world-
wide fame. The hero of this farce is transformed into the boy, and
has to bear all the ills that school-boy
flesh is heir to; which is just exactly
the main idea of the plot of Vice
Versa. Evident, therefore, as it may
be, that LAW went to GUTHRIE, it is
by no means clear that any good
grounds exist for GUTHBIE going to
law.
The best written scenes of Mr.
LAW'S "New and original farcical
comedy" which justify him in apply-
ing the term " comedy " to his farci-
cal work (that is neither " new " nor
"original" if founded on Ihe story
of Vice Versa) is just that por-
tion of it with which the essential
portion of the Vice Versa story has
necessarily nothing whatever to do,
I mean the scenes between the Irish
adventurer, Mrs. liennick and Dr.
Candy; those between Theodore de
Brizac and Nancy Roach ; and those
also between the latter and her
father.
The two characters that stand out
in this piece are Felix Roach, which
is admirably played by Mr. J. D.
BEVEHIDGE, and the French Usher,
perfectly impersonated by Mr.
SYDNEY WARDEN, the best French-
man on the stage since the days of
Monsieur MAEIUS at the Strand. Mr.
BKAUCHAMP'S Dr. Candy is very
good, and Mr. T. PALMER, as the
irate Farmer, is a first-rate bit of
character, not a bit too highly
coloured, not the least overdone;
and this may be truthfully said in
praise of every one all round in
about as complete a cast as has been
seen on the boards of any theatre for
a considerable time.

Aunt is emphatically a one-part piece, but this is not the case with
The. New Boy; and it never could have jumped so suddenly into
public favour, had it not been for its
good comedy scenes, carried on by an
excellent dramatis personee.
Mr. WEEDON GROSSMITH does not
look quite youug enough to deceive
the schoolmaster, the usher, the
schoolgirl, and the knowing Irish
cousin. He could improve his
"make-up" by giving nimself a
fresher and healthier colour, and in-
stead of wearing a costume such as is
displayed in a boy's tailor's shop
window, he should be dressed in
"Etons" as is the Thackerayan
Bullock Major. Mr. WEEDON'S boy
belongs to a Sunday School lot, and
not to the establishment of Dr.
Candy, LL.D., who presumably
prepares his pupils for Eton, Harrow
and Winchester, and who are not so
"grown up" as to have dropped all
acquaintance with the cane. Any-
how, this is the "dressing" I would
suggest for The Neic Boy, who will
have outgrown everything except his
popularity by the time he has become
"an old boy." B. IN THE Box.

"COMPULSORY PURCHASE OF LAND

"I do not understand this. Are we

played by Miss GLADYS HOMFREY. The Author may thank this
clever actress for a good deal, hut the piece could not have been
saved by her, had not the cast been so judiciously selected as it has

would be very easy for the Author to have given us too much of this

UNARMING.
"Unarm—the lonjf day's task i-s done."
Antony and Cleopatra, Act IV., Scene 12.
AT last!—Chill phrase by loyal love abhorred!
There lives a lingering sadness in each word !—
At last the unvanquished kuight suspends his sword.
The Lancelot of our lists for so long years,
Victor so oft amidst loud storm of cheers;
Shall not such passing touch the source of tears?
"Sot Arthur's passing, out from living sight,
Hut the withdrawal of the war-worn knight
From the glad fray and the tierce joy of tight.
War-worn but yet unbroken, straight and strong,
We hoped-he yet should head the charge for long,
Tht star of battle and the theme of song.
It scarcely seemed old Time himself had force
This many-laurelled champion to unhorse,
Shiver his lance, or stay his conquering course.
From clustering jet to scattered silver went
The hero's locks,.yet left his frame unbent,
His courage unimpaired, his strength unspent.
He seemed of Ag«, as of all lesser foes,
The easy master in the ceaseless close.
Renewed in strength from every bout he rose.
"He's down—at last 1" foes cried full many a time;
"His strength is sapped, shorn is his crest sublime."
He rose, and smote, and won as in full prime.
E'en now his four-score years bow not his crest.
With sword unscabbarded or lance in rest,
He looks the ready chief disdaining rest.
Yet he hangs up that sword, that lance lays by,
Conscious, though loud applauding cohorts cry,
Of failing vigour and of dimming eye.
"The seven-fold shield of Ajax cannot koep"
Time's battery from- the heart. The cruel creep
•"* Of the slow years bears all to the great deep.
Bears champion with coward, knight with clown.
The hero of a hundred tights steps down,
Hangs up the sheathed sword, and takes the crown.
"No more a soldier:—Bruised pieces, go;
You have been nobly borne." So. in proud woe,
Cried Roman Antony, by love laid low.
"Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,"
This is no Antony; here's a nobler one;
Yet like the Roman his great course is run.
From source to sea a fair full-flooded flow
Of stainless waters, swelling as they go,
Now widening broad in the sun's westering glow.
Broad widening to the ocean, whither all
The round world's fertilising floods must fall.
The sweeping river with the streamlet small.
Hang up the sword! It struck its latest stroke,
A swashing one, there where the closed ranks broke
Into wild cheers that all the echoes woke.
That stroke, the last, was swift, and strong, and keen.
Now hang thou there, though sheathed, yet silver-clean,
For never felon stroke has dimmed thy sheen!
For thee, good knight and grey, whose gleaming crest
Leads us no longer, every generous breast
Breathes benediction on thy well-won rest.
The field looks bare without thee, and o'ercast
With dark and ominous shadows, and thy last
Reveille was a rousing battle-blast!
But though with us the strife may hardly cease,
We wish Ihee in well-earned late-coming ease,
Long happy years of honourable peace!

A RAID ON A COCKROACH CLUB.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FKOM THE DIA.UY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Comment, Thursday, March 1.—Mr. ff.. Downing
Street, S.W., to Toby, M.P., Tropics, E.G. Come back at
once. Some jieople say I'm going to resign. Others say I'm not.
Come along, and tell me how it is.
In obedience to this summons, left South Africa with its glorious
sunlight, its blue mountains, its soft South Atlantic sea, its peach
gardens, and its vineyards; hastened home to Westminster. Was
what people here fatuously call a fine day when we arrived; at least,
not raining; something glimmering in sky that looked like the sun
after severe attack of influenza.
"Sunlight and water, / call it," said SAKK, gloomily looking at
ths best that can be done in London in March.
Got down to House just in time to see Mr. G. enter. On the whole,
since he leaves the point to me, I should say, on question submitted
in his telegram, "The Noes have it." There is no resignation in!
that eye with which he surveys the House,
crowded in every part. More than two months
since I was here; seems as if nothing had passed;
certainly the Parish Councils Bill hasn't. House
engaged on its consideration when, before Christ-
mas, SAEK and I paired and went off. On it
still; Mr. G.'s speech makes clear that the end
has come at last. The Lords have proved con-
tumelious to the end.
"Very well," says Mr. G., taking that august
assembly by the ear (so to speak), and vigorously-
shaking it; "you shall have your own way, you
bad. ungrateful boy. But it will be only for a
while. If we thwart you now you '11 only kick
and scream and tear the Bill to ribbons, at a
time when we have no alternative but to east
the fragments away. So we '11 take it as you
have left it, and put it on the shelf. By-and-
by, at a more convenient season, we '11 have it
out with you. There's a long score to settle;
we '11 choose our time for taking the work in
hand, anl we'll do it thoroughly, settling it
once for all."
Radicals screamed with delight at prospect
thus opened up. Haughty aristocrats like
ELLIS ASHMEAD-BARTLETT (Knight) curled the
lip, and scornfully laughed, "Ha, ha!" SAGE
OF QUEEN ANNE'S GATE, encouraged by this
incitement to anarchy, crossed the floor and
made an attempt, ineffective at first onslaught, Toby and the " Dock

to eject ATTORNEY-GENERAL, who, finding no place on crowded
Treasury Bench, had appropriated SAGE'S seat below Gangway. Two
dozen Peers cowered in the Gallery over the clock. Mr. AKCH rose
to his feet and waved his hat; PKINCE AKTHUB, stepping into arena,
picked up the glove thrown down by Mr. G., and flung it back.
Listening to his brave words, gazing upon his fearless port, Peers
in the Gallery plucked up courage. When, fixing a glittering: eye
on Mr. G., who having delivered his challenge had relapsed into
attitude almost of humility, PBINCE ARTHDR satd, " Let me tell the
right hon. gentleman we look forward without dismay to the fight,"
ASITBOURNE in Peers Gallery half rose to his feet and made as
though he, too, would wave his hat. "Nay," said Lord MORRIS in
his grave, solemn tones. "Nay, my brother, let us leave these ill-
considered ebullitions to the newer nobility;" and his dreamy eye
rested for a moment on Lord ROWTON, who made no sign.
A historic scene; a tine audience; two speeches worthy of the
occasion; and so home to prepare for the new Session. "Do you
really think he's going to resign?" I asked the old friend whom it's
so hard to call anything but HARTINGTON.
"Well, Toby," said the DUKE, "you ought to
know better than I, since I 'm no longer in his
confidence. But it 'a hard to see how a man can
make a speech like that, opening up a new and
desperate campaign, on the eve of the day when
he himself lays down his arms. It's too remi-
niscent of another great soldier,
\Vho fled full soon on the first of June,
And bade the rest keep fighting."
Business done.—The Session's. HENRY FOWLER
goes home, carrying in his bosom the one ewe lamb
that has survived the bliz/ard, a survival largely
due to his solicitude and Parliamentary skill.
Monday.—After all Mr. G. is going, not to say
gone. Secret well kept to the end. House knows
now that the speech it listened to on Thursday
was the last he will ever deliver as Minister of
the Crown; possibly the very last of the incom-
parable coruscation that has flashed across the
House of Commons through these more than
sixty years. The few Members present to-day
to witness barren ceremony of Prorogation tread
softly, as if in presence of a great bereave-
ment. Tories, Radicals, Liberals, Conservatives,
Unionists, Parnellites, Nationalists, whatever
we be, we are each all one in our homage to Ihe
greatest Parliament man known since Parlia-
ment began.
Business done.—Prorogalion.

ITALIAN FINANCE.
(From the Newspapers of the
next Century.)
YESTERDAY Signer GHASPI
made his statement of the pro-
posed new taxes. He said that
unhappily there is now a deficit
of twenty billions of lire, bnt
that the Government hoped to
meet this by increased taxa-
tion, and not by any reduction
of the Army or Navy. (Loud
applause from the two deputies
present, both supporters of the
Government.) [It may be ex-
plained that all the members of
the Opposition are now loaded
with fetters, and imprisoned in
the deepest dungeons of the
Castle of Sant' Angelo. The
supporters of the Government,
except two required to form a
quorum, are serving with the
colours.] The Minister said
that it gave him great pleasure
to reflect that every Italian,
even if blind or lame, is now a
soldier or a sailor. He had just
received a telegram stating
that, in the wildest portion of
the Apennines, another man
had been discovered. Unfor-
tunately, he was over eighty
vears old, and bedridden.
Nevertheless, he had been
added to the reserve forces, and
had increased the nominal
strength of the army to
26,349,001, including the im-
mense reserveof f emalemilitia,
now in a most flourishing con-
dition. (Loud cheers.) The i
Navy was also in a most effi-
cient state, and Italy was with
justice proud of her 270,600
sailors, male and female. (Re-

WILL BE!" She. "AH, YOB 'LL FIND YOU 'RE WHQKQ!"
newed applause.) He had now
to consider the increase of tax-
ation necessary to maintain
this state of efficiency. It
would be difficult to add to the
existing octroi duties on bread,
now at nve lire the loaf; or on
water, at two lire the pint.
(Here one of the deputies
fainted from exhaustion, and
was carried out. It was stated
that he had had no food for
three days.) It was also un-
fortunately impossible to in-
crease the income-tax, now at
99 centesimi in the lira, exclu-
sive of other duties, since no
one had any income to tax.
(Here the other deputy took
three W-centesimi pieces from
his pocket, and gazed mourn-
fully at them.) It had there-
fore been resolved to place a tax
on air. and a Royal Decree had
just been published forbid-
ding any person to breathe
except on payment of 15 cen-
tesimi for each inflation of the
lungs. (Here the Deputy left
the chamber hastily, in search
of the Tax Collector for the
district.) "Gentlemen of the
Government," concluded Sig-
ner GBASPI, " since there is no
one else here, it is evident that
these measures will be passed,
so that our country, still main-
taining her glorious Army,
more numerous by five persons
than that of Russia, and her
magnificent Navy.more power-
ful by one torpedo-boat than
that of France, can hold her
rightful place amongst the
Great Powers, and hand down
to posterity a record of untar-
nished glory."

A VADE MECUM FOR THE HOUSE OF PEERS.
(Compiled by a Lord Literally in Waiting.)
Question. What are the benefits of having a
seat in the House of Peers?
Answer. To receive a large number of Blue
Books, to be called upon to dwell for so many
hours every year in a particularly draughty
Chamber, and to have the daily advantage of
seeing oneself abused in a fair proportion of
the Press.
Q. Are there any other privileges?
A. To be asked to attend at charity dinners
by professional philanthropists and to feed
with snobs.
Q. Can you not remember a few more?
A. To be called by tradesmen, self-made
millionaires and flunkeys, "my lord," and to
be charged double everywhere for everything
in recognition of one's title.
Q. Are there no duties attached to the
position?
A. Certainly. A Peer is supposed to act
on behalf of his neighbours, whether they be
rich or whether they be poor.
Q. Has he any particular training for this
emplovment?
A. Ninety-nine times out of every hundred
he has been educated at a public school, and
an university, and five times out of every
half dozen his ancestors for a generation or
two have been gentlemen.
Q. Surely this should give some guarantee
that a Peer will understand the meaning of
noblesse oblige?
A. So it would seem to every one save the
Editor of a radical and levelling newspaper.
Q. Are there not Second Chambers in every
country under the sun?
A. I think so, but geography was not my
strongest point when I was at Eton.
Q. And as a whole the debates and divisions
of the Upper House have been beneficial to the
British Empire?
A. Soi I believe, although I must confess
that I did not pay much attention to Consti-
tutional History when I took my Double First
from Christ Church.
Q. Then do you think you should consent to
the abolition of the institution of which you
form a part?
A. No; because I should be the means of
breaking up the British Constitution.
Q. Can you imagine any advantage that
could be derived by this English application
of the Japanese " Happy Dispatch?
A. Only the questionable merit of pleasing
Mr. HENKY LiBorcnEBE.
Q. And would this merit compensate for
the demerits of the scheme?
A. I venture to think not, although, of
course, every one would be delighted to oblige
the senior Member for Northampton for the
sake of his uncle, the late Lord IAUXTON.
Q. Then what course do you propose to
pursue?
A. To let well alone, although Truth may
be at the bottom of it.

1. Jones was a tuft-hunter. One day, in a train, he encountered an
elderly gentleman who aroused great interest in his bosom. "Porter,"
said that elderly gentleman, " 'ave you seen my old hall?" "Got an old
hall!" murmured Jones to himself. "Rich man—probably duke! Should
like to cultivate him!'
1. The Stranger was affable. "Did you ever 'ave an old hall '•" he said.
'MVTiy—er—n-no," said Jones. "Very convenient thing to 'ave," said the
Stranger. "I 've got all manner o' things in my old hall." "Ah—armour,
and ancestors, and tapestry, and secret doors, no doubt," thought Jones to
himself.

she said, speaking of her nephews

It was n summer's afternoon,
Old GASPER'S work was done,

last line vulgar, decidedly, but it
didn't strike us so when we were
mere children. And then I re-
member his grandson, 'Little
PIPPIKIJ.',' asks him a lot of ques-
tions; and Old GASPER'S answer
was always the same,—
'.Why that I eaiinot tell,' says he,
'But 'twas a famous victor}*.'
And he went on repeating the
same thing at the end of every
verse, in the most irritating man-
ner. But, as children, we were
fond of Old GASPER and PIPPIKIN.
I 've never seen them since."
SOME VIEWS ON THE MONEY MARKET.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,
I have been forced to study the Money Market. This was how
it happened. Having injured my right hand, which I now carry in a
sling, I am under considerable disadvantages in reading my morning
paper in a crowded railway carriage. Those who have ever tried to
unfold, re-fold, and double back an elusive broadsheet with the left
hand alone, will appreciate my difliculties. There is nothing more
perverse or malignant in existence than a newspaper for which a
man can only use his left hand. One corner of it is sure to insert
itself into your neighbour's eye, while another corner is engaged in
ruffling the opposite man's top hat, and when you have more or
less completed the process, you will rind probably that you hold in
your hand an irregularly formed ball, which has no resemblance
whatever to a newspaper.
AVell, the other morning I bought my newspaper, and took the
only vacant seat in a smoking-carriage on the District Railway. I
sat still for some time, and then began to shake out the paper.
A very polite gentleman opposite (I do not know his name^, but I
hereby thank him for his kindly sympathy) perceived my difficulty,
and offered to help me. He took the paper from my willing
hand, and folded it so that I could read the leading articles and
the foreign intelligence. These took me comfortably through three
stations, but as there were live still left, and as I was anxious to read
some political speeches and the law intelligence, I was not satisfied.
However, I couldn't begin the struggle afresh, so with a sigh I laid
the paper down. My sympathetic friend observed my predicament,
and once again offered to help me. With deft hands he rearranged
the paper and handed it back to me saying, in a tone of smiling in-
terrogation, "Money Market, I suppose?" Now, if there is one
thing I never read in the daily paper, it is the Money Market. I
have never understood it, and never shall, but what was I to do?
There was the paper, neatly folded, with nothing but "Money
Market" and " Mines showing. I could not presume again on my
TCI. cn.
friend's kindness. How was I to explain to him that I didn't want
to read the Money Market? He would probably have thought me a
maniac and treated me accordingly. I therefore resigned myself to
reading what was before me with as good a grace as I could muster,
and for the benefit of my fellow-men I here beg to offer the result of
my investigations.
I have no doubt the article I read was a nice article, written with a
due regard to accuracy and with a literary style appropriate to the
subject treated of. The first statement, however, fairly took my
breath away. The writer said:
"Short money was distinctly scarce to-day, which was not surprising."
I beg to assure him that he is entiiely mistaken. It was surprising,
for it certainly startled me to learn that money possessed degrees of
height. I know what it is to be short of money, but I don't suppose
that condition is particularly scarce. But it had never struck me
that money, as money, could be tall or short, or could, in fact, have
any other size than that ordained by the authorities of the Mint.
Finally, I came to the conclusion that short money must mean three-
penny pieces, though I am still without an idea as to why three-
penny pieces should have been scarce last Wednesday. But I had
not done with short money, for I learnt immediately afterwards that
"The temporary tightness of short money kept discount rates fairly steady,
and fine three months' bills were quoted ut 1} per cent."
I began to see light. If short money gets temporarily tight, it is
perhaps natural that it should make itself scarce. But then I was
thrown back again. That in this inebriated condition, short money
should have been able to keep anything else fairly steady was more
than I could believe. I can only "regret that fine three months' bills
should have allowed themselves to be seen in such disreputable com-
pany. After this I was not surprised to learn that "African Cy.
Perps. had fallen" consequent, no doubt, on a collision with short
money in a state of temporary tightness.
Yours pecuniarily, A VAGBANT.

reckon this as perhaps her best impersona-
tion, bar one, given in London. Mr. GKOROE
CLARKE, as Mali-olio, is capital, and Mr.
LEWIS, Miss CATHERINE LEWIS, and the rest
of the merry roistering party, are hard to
beat. The solo and part-singing and the
music throughout is charming. Those among
us who fear being bored by a classic should
just step into DALY'S and learn how the Bard
was not for an age or for any particular
country, but for all time and for all sorts and
conditions of men and women, and how the
humour and the fun is as fresh as ever it was
three centuries ago. We have to thank our
American Cousins for this Twelfth Night treat.
Truly they "take the (Twelfth Night) cake."

'' Well, look here " (desperately). '' What do you say to a trip in my!
yacht? Southern seas! Venice '. Constantinople! Olympia! And •
then, when the winds are hushed and the steam is shut off for the
night, we would fly with no visible means of locomotion over the i
silvery deep! You smile? Where is the pain?" "Oh! if I could
only have the yacht without you in it!" (He winces.) "Yes, I say,
give us women freedom and we would all go one better than
NAPOLEON. NELSOJT knew nothing of the eternal I! Bah! and he was

A long silence broken onlv by the chirp of a grasshopper. The air
is charged like a battery. It seems that a submarine cable connects
these two souls. Nevertheless, she distinctly observes that the
grasshopper has strained his Achilles-tendon. Curious that at such
a climax the minutest detail should not escape her. Am I right in
thinking that no novelist has as yet detected this remarkable phe-
nomenon? He comes nearer (I mean the grey man). His skin
beneath his collar blushes a rich cobalt. Is my little moment

to send me away, liang something white on the gitoseberry-oush (our
gooseberry-bush) to-morroir about the ninth hour."' She rises and
is gone like a water-snake.

It is to-morrow about the eighth hour. She is still in bed. There
is a nod at the window. It is all right ; only a blushing sweet-
william. On the mantel-piece is
a daguerreotype of her late aunt,
in a velvet bodice and other things.
But it is not that which drives her
crazy. It isherhusband'scheery
pick-axe in the garden. Is he
really digging her grave? Why,
surely, no; he is simply arranging
the onion-bed. Yet what an in-
teresting corpse she would make!
The pity is that one can never see
one's own corpse in the glass.
Stay, is that BETSY? liOh!
BETSY" (the young cook enters
demurely for orders), "I wonder
had you ever a lover?" "Well.
Ma'm, what do you think?
"Sav, what happened him, any-
way'?" "Why, he left me,
Ma m, left me for Another;
and" (regretfully) "we might
have married, and had such
hearenly twins;; and, oh! he had
such a beautiful crest on his
writing-paper!"
A moment's tension fellows; the
next sees the lady feeling for a
coin in her dress-pocket. She spins it deftly. "Heads, he stays!
tails, he goes! Tails! by all that is virtuous."
"BETSY!" (Her voice is firm, like a quickset hedge.) "BETSY!
I cannot spare my 'nighty' just now, but your white apron will do
as well. 1 ou do love me, don't you?" (Kisses her.) "Then for my
sake go and hang yourself for a little while on the gooseberry-bush.
Mind! the jooseierry-bush!" "Yes, Ma'm."
A rare fidelity! And so few men could have understood or even
spelt the why in BETSY!
* * * • * *
Two hours later she wakes up, and remembers the faithful girl!
Perhaps it is even now too late! She hurries through her toilet.
The daguerreotype shows no sign. Threads of bogwool float per-
sistently in the summer air. She is by the gooseberry-bush with a
stout pair of scissors. Too late! The girl is gone! Another hand,
a hand that held a stop-watch, has cut her down, and BETSY is by
this time a free and unfettered woman, on her way to a yacht.
The grey man, after all, had his consolation.

And Social Democrats have this of human,
That they can play the fool about a woman.
But, Mr. HARRIS. Mr. HARRIS, you
Deserve no love, for slighting Beauty's shoe.
You should be handed o'er to Mrs. lirundy,
With cameo brooch, long chain, and silks o'

Who'd brand the Graces as three foreign

And cram poor Cupid into knickerbockers.
Yes, where brave days of powder and of

Such brief abandonment of joy would snatch,
And modern Democrats the same would win.
Proving that woman makes the whole world

We want no legal phantom of propriety
To fix his Human canons of Society.
But soft. No comment on a law report!
"Honour the King!"—here's no contempt
of Court.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
"RECOMMEND me a good
novel," write his many friends
to the Baron, to whom present-
ly he doth reply,unhesitatingly:
lt Ask for Hooks of Steel, and
see that you get it. Tiswritby
one HELEJT PEOTHEEO LEWIS,
and published by Messrs.
HUTCHINSON & Co., so now you
know as much as the best-in-
formed advertisement can tell
you. 'Tis a queer title, nay. a
bad title, "a title," quoth the
Baron, "that set me against it
for some time." There it lay on
his table neglected, when one
afternoon, having unexpected-
ly finished his tale of work, it
occurred to the mighty mind
of the Baron, or the Baronial
mind, that there might possi-
bly be something sharp in
Jfooks of Steel. "Ladies and
gentlemen, my readers all, 'tis
a very powerful novel, a well-
imagined, well-developed plot,
worked out by means tho-
roughly original, and by simply
natural characters." To what
is somewhat conventionally
melodramatic in it, the abor-
tive abduction, to wit, the Baron
has some objection; not on the
score of its improbability,—for
who can say with certain given
characters what may or may
not be probable as long as the
personages of the drama are
represented as acting consist-
ently with the characters as-
signed to them by their author?
Critically speaking as to the
heroine, the making her such a
student of SHAKSPEARE that
she applies quotations to every
situation in which she finds
herself, is rather a nuisance to
the reader, and must have been
somewhat hampering to the
authoress. There are o)d farces
and antiquated novels in which

the same idea, always more or
less wearisome.has been worked
to death, and long ago played
ont. Here it is quite unneces-
sary, and adds nothing to the
humorous portions of the story,
which are good enough in
themselves and without this.
Had the authoress, giving her
heroine's childish r e m i n i s-
oences of home, writtennothing
else but the following brief
summary of her early family
history, it would have atoned
for some dreary chapters, did
any such exist. The Baron
begs to quote this passage:—
"Of my father, I, though for
different reasons, find it difficult
to write. He left when I was very
youne. He took the governess
withnim. I was glad of that."
Isn't it perfect? What a
summary. The child was six
or seven at the time, and just
remembers her delight at the
removal of the governess. A
domestic drama in four lines:
the quintessence of pathos and
humour combined, at least, so
thinks the Barou, nor can he
recall at this moment any pas-
sage equally brief in STERNE
or THACKERAY that tells a
whole drama of events and
emotions in so few words.
Read it, my friends, ye who
ask me for a book, says
THE BARON DB B.-W.
DELIGHTED TO HEAR IT.—
The eminent physician, Sir
WILLIAM BROADBENT, Bart.,
is restored to health. This
is excellent news, and could
hardly have been expected,
seeing that the doctor who
was first called in to attend
his brother medico was awed!
But Sir WILLIAM soon began
to rally when complying with
his adviser's Orrf-mances.
"THE NURSERY OF THE STAGE."
How marvellous is Mr. ARTHUR ROBERTS in Don Juan at the
Gaiety. Whether he be a gentleman bathing, or a cockney sports-
man out fishing or shooting, or a music-
hall masher, or an ancient Greek philo-
sopher, or an auctioneer, or twenty other
characters in the same piece, for he is
everything in turn and nothing long,
he is the cause of continual and spas-
modic merriment. I am informed that
there is scarcely a performance of his
without a surprise for the audience,
and equally so for those who are on the
scene with him.
Miss CISSIE LOFTUS
is capital with her
imitations of pop-
ular vocalists, and
Mr. EDMUND PAYNE
** something or
other —it doesn't
matter a bit what,
as he has nearly as many changes of costume as
Mr. ARTHUR ROBERTS—is very droll. The dan-
cing, of course, is good, and Miss LOUISE MON-
TAGUE ought to be able to do a great deal more
than she does, if she ever gets a chance in either
Comic Opera or Opera Boutfe. It is a pity that
Miss MILLIE HYLTON should in one of her songs
suggest an inevitable comparison between her
and NELLIE FARREN in the latter's inimitable

Street Arab, written by the late ROBERT REECK, and marvellously
sung and acted by Miss NELLIE as Aladdin. Miss HYLTOX might be
very well satisfied with the success of her " Linger Longer Loo.'"
which is still in the full swing of its popularity.
"I hear," said one Royal Academi-
cian to another R.A., but which Royal
A. it was, and who was the other R.A.,
I have quite forgotten, "I hear that
you like my pictures, but you describe
my skies as ' putty.'" "Well, my
dear fellow," returned Tother R.A.,
pleasantly, " I own I did. Sat—I'm
eery fond of putty." So of the Gaiety I'.
piece and players with ARTHUR ROBERTS
at their head; it is
mere child's play;
it is like children in
the nursery dress-
ing up, saying,
"Now I'll pretend
to be so-and-so,"
or acting eccentric
scenes with their »
toy theatre and shoving on any characters in any
costume, letting them do anything without
rhyme or reason, but always funnily, absurdly
funnily, and all done in the best of all possible
spirits. I am very fond of such nursery enter-
tainments: and the Gaiety Theatre might well be
styled " The Nursery of the Stage," with ARTHUR
ROBERTS as the big baby, the absurdest, wbimsi-
calest, comicalist, laughablest baby of them all.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday. March 12.—Unusual bustle in both
Houses to-day. Remember in days pone by how JOSEPH GILLIS, in
course of all-ni<rht sitting, repaired to Library, stretched himself on
two chairs, slept the sleep of the just, turned up again in House at
six o'clock in the morning, "feeling," as he said, "like a giant
refreshed." Longest Session on record having been balanced (on
CHARLES LAMB'S principle of attendance at office) by shortest recess
ever known, Members come back to-day so many giants refreshed.
Sat through 220 days and nights in Session that closed last Monday;
beginning afresh this Monday ready to sit on till Christmas Eve.
One place vacant—at least, filled'by another. Mr. G. will no more
be seen on Treasury Bench. In his seat towers the colossal figure of
the SQUITCE OF MALWOOD.
"Yes," said the SQUIRE, as we shook hands with all the warmth
engendered by prolonged absence of six davs, "both Houses under
entirely new management. Hope we shall do well; certainly failure
will not result from lack of effort. Don't know which has the harder
task, ROSEBEHY. with a majority of six to one against him; or me,
with a nominal majority of 36 behind me. Have offered SAGE
OF QUEEN ANNE'S GATE to ROSEBERY. Might create him Baron
TWICKENHAM of Pope's Villa. ROSEBEHY says better leave things
as they are. Dangeous experiment to make a Radical a Peer.
Within twelve months the SAOE would drift towards the Dukes,
and TwiCEENBAH would be counted among the Dissentient
Liberals."
"Well," I said, "your majority at least is all right. If it pulled
through Mich a Session as (he last it will do anything. Certainly
you've lost MARJOKIBANKS,
a Heaven-born whip. But
ELLIS is a capital fellow,
and, moreover, 'BOBBY'
sticks to the old ship. With
Youth at the prow and ELLIS
at the helm, she'll travel
far."
"Ah!" said the SQUIEE.
stroking his chin, a troubled
look crossing his ingenuous
countenance, "but the worst
of our majority is that it's
always threatening to split
up. Our little household is
in a chronic state of giving
a month's notice. There's the Irish Cook, represented by JOHN
REDMOND and the rest of the Muses, gives notice that unless we do
something impossible he '11 leave. Then the Welsh housemaid writes
to say if she s obliged to go to church on Sundays she won't stay in
the place. Even the Scotch Butler threatens to go unless we, inter
alia, veto the opportunities of other people to get wnuskey when
they want it. I ve often thought, dear TOBY, that if I started in
business again with any prospect of reaching the position of Leader,
I should come out as a Tory. Look at PRINCE ARTHUR'S happy
lot. It's rare, indeed, that anyone on his side kicks over
traces. If they do, the PRINCE has only to hint that if this sort of
thing goes on he '11 go off. Thereupon, stamping and rearing cease;
the truculent 'Neigh, Xeigh!' becomes the disciplined 'Yea,
Yea.' At best of times it's no easy thing to drive the Liberal
coach. Just now, with the road up in many places, and the team
restive, it's peculiarly hard for a new coachman."

MONSIEUR RIP AT ASNIERES.
(A Legend of the Boat-race.)
MONSIEUR RIP, when he closed his eyes on the banks of the Seine
at Asnieres, was wearing a boating costume of the latest mode.
There had been pictures of him in the print shops of the Rue de
Rivoli, and he had accepted them as faithful portraits.
"Yes," said he, as he glanced at one of these engravings; "my
dress is not exaggerated. I have high boots like those worn by Life
Guards in ' Old England ' and the Cent Gards
of the Second Empire. Yes; and my stiff linen
shirt, and my even stiffer linen collar, is admir-
ably represented. Again, here are my buckskin
breeches, and my lavender kid gloves, and my
delicately tinted necktie, and my artistically
arranged button-hole. I am here to the life.
It is the costume of the French boating-man!
Long live France!"
['? T^ ^° m^ Monsieur Rip before closing his eyes
^ jjr^ and dreaming his dream. Then came his vision.
SV £| xx.. f?te> He saw in his sleep delegates from England
coming to Paris and teaching his countrymen
how to row, and how to train for boat-racing. His compatriots were
initiated in the mysteries of the tub, and the advantages of the
matutinal scamper. He could not make it out. It was contrary to
the traditions of the race. He was quite the " sporting man." but
then it was a "sporting man" of his own particular pattern. When
he went a hunting it was with a short sword and a huge horn.
When he raced he chose August for hurdles and other obstacles.
After a while he came to himself. He rubbed his eyes. Where
were the pleasure-boats of his delightful Asnieres, with their cargo
of long-booted swains and elegantly attired damsels? Where were
his counterparts and their companions? They had gone. It was
early morning, and there he saw a sight which fairly filled him with
amazement. He noticed a number of athletes, clad in flannels,
running steadily round a cinder-path, evidently doing a fixed
distance. They looked like thorough JOHN BULLS, and had not a
soupi^on of the petit-maltre who used so frequently to be the model
of the artists of the boulevards.
"Why JULES, ALPHONSE, GUSTAVE!" cried the astonished
Monsieur RIP. "What are you doing?"
JULES stopped, but the others went on.
"We are training for the great boat-race between London and
Paris," explained JULES. "I can give you a few minutes, as 1 am
in the centre of the boat, and need not keep down my weight to the
limit of those others."
"I am glad to see you, my dear friend," said Monsieur RIP.
"And you must breakfast with me. A mouthful of soup, a sole
a la Normande, a ragout of"
"Stop, stop!" interrupted JULES. "I had my breakfast at eight,
and our coach doesn't allow kickshaws. I have to practise for a
couple of hours."
"But it is raining, my dear .friend," cried Monsieur RIP. "You
surely will not run the risk of spoiling your clothes with the rain.
For you cannot row with an umorella." JULES laughed, and said
that he did not cure a jot for a ducking. On the contrary, he
liked the rain, as it made the river "nice
and wet."
"And you have adopted the manners and
customs of Albion the Perfidious1'" con-
tinued Monsieur RIP.
"Don't you call names," said JULES,
indignantly. "Our friends, the English,
are particularly good fellows, and we like
them. 'A fellow-training makes us won-
drous kind,' to adapt SHAKSPEARE to the ~
emergencies of the moment."
"You mean SUAK-IS-PEARE, the great
YILLIAMS:-"
"I mean what I say. and nothing else," said downright JULES.
"It seems to me, old chap, you are slightly out of date. You are
'the Frenchman for laughter,' which is as scarce as the ' Anglais
pour rire.' Come, I can waste no more time on you. So good-bye."
"But I have been asleep for twenty years," cried Monsieur RIP.
"What had I better do ?'r
"Why, go to sleep again, as the world has caught you up and
passed you. France is no longer the laughing-stock of England.
Mossoo' is out of date, and we Know how to hold our own."
So Monsieur RIP, seeing that he was "not in it," took JULES's
advice, and commenced a fresh slumber.

APPROACHING FINANCIAL CRISIS.—On Saturday, the 17th instant,
there will be a great run on two well-known banks. Don't be panic-
stricken! 'tis the day fixed for the University Boat-race.

AVADEMECUM FOR THE
EASTER HOLIDAYS.
(Sy a Misanthrope who does
not intend to observe them.)
Question. What is the
great advantage of the,
Easter holiday over any I
other vacation?
Answer. That it is shorter'
than any of its rivals.
Q. Then you do not con-
sider it a recreation?
A. Certainly not; on the
contrary, I believe it to he •
distinctly a labour.
Q. In what shape does
the labour lay?
A. In the shape of so-'
called pleasure-trips and
other festivities equally;
foolish and fraudulent.
Q. But surely you tind:
a visit to Paris and back
in four days a delightful •
relaxation f
A. Indeed 1 do not. If
the sea is calm the hotels
are sure to be full; and if
there is a rough passage j
nothing on earth will com-
pensate for the couple of;
hours of pure misery.
Q.'But surely travelling
at Easter is popular?
A. So popular that every
one does it and inconve-
niences every one else.
Q. But nowadays the
railway and boat arrange- [
ments are so excellent P
A. Sufficiently excellent;
to give a foundation for a!
report that they might be
better.
Q. But would we not find
at this moment hundreds of
compatriots abroad y
A. Quite so ; which af-

fords the best reason for re-
maining at home.
Q. In your opinion, are
your countrymen to be
shunned when discovered
on the Continent?
A. Why, certainly. If
they are personally con-
ducted they are on bad
terms with LIXDI.EY MUB-
BAY, and if they travel en
prince they are simply in-
supportable.
Q. But suppose you avoid
your fellow-travellers, will
not your Easter trip abroad
under those circumstances
be enjoyable?
A. No, for you will then
have to endure the hotel
proprietors, who "do " you
bpttL as to your accommoda-
tion and as to your pocket.
Q. Is it necessary that
you should always meet
with swindling caravan-
sary keepers?
A. Not necessary, but
habitual.
Q. But does not foreign
travel enlarge the mind:
A. Not necessarily, al-
though it may lighten the
purse, and extend one's
knowledge (and use) of
strong- language.
Q. Then whatis your best
way of enjoying Easter P
A. By ignoring it.
Q. And you would keep
on at your ordinary work?
A. Certainly, for it
would be less labour than
trying unsuccessfully to
find recreation in the hard
toi 1 of imaginary relaxat ion.

TO THE GIRL OF TO-DAY.
(A Screed by a/i Anatomical Poet.)
[" There is a terrible rumour abroad. . . . The
enormous and preposterous shoulders, that girls
have been wearing, are of no inconsiderable
weight, and this has brought about a development
of the deltoid and neighbouring muscles; conse-
quently a permanent enlargement supervenes,
and the graceful, polished, well-shaped shoulder of
the English maiden is likelv soon to disappear alto-
gether."—" The Jtystattdei;" Graphic, Mnrc/i 10.]
QrEBY.—When last week Parliamentary
questions were occupying most minds of any
voting power, there appeared a large-typed
heading to a column of the Daily Arews, Re-
turn of Mr. W. H. STEAD!" At first sight,
the readers put down paper and exclaimed,
"STEAD an M.P.! Where has he been stand-
ing for?" Then, on resuming their perusal, <
they discovered that he had just come back i
from Chicago. But—why come back?

Nor rival Caryatid, pillar-wise,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAEI.
BALLAD OF THE SPOOK.
IT was the melancholy PSYKE,
Within the haunted room.
"lie I can never, never strike!"
He murmured in his gloom.
"Mv spiritual sense is sealed.
What others say they spy,
It never yet has been revealed
To my material eye."
• • • *
That night he saw a real Spook
Rise from the empty air,
And anxiously begin to look
And fumble everywhere.
He spoke no word, though heavy
sighs
Revealed his wretchedness.
Shoeless his feet, but otherwise
He was in evening dress.
The watcher trembled with
delight,
His heart beat loud and fast.
"Long have I waited for this
night,"
He cried; "we meet at last!
"And'now you stand before my
eyes,
I long to hear defined
The nature and the boundaries
Of matter and of mind.
"You, you can satisfy our doubt
On many a bitter crux!
What sayest thou, Phantom?
Ah, speak out
More clearly. 'Fiat lux.""
Right wearily replied the ghost,
In grief-worn accents slow,
"I 'm looking for the shoes I lost
Two centuries ago!"
Envoi.
Ever the Phantom goes and comes,
Mobbed by inquiring hosts,
And there are many Mediums,
And there are many ghosts.

PARTING SHOT.
She. "AND NOW, MY DEAR, HAVING GIVEN YOU A BIT OF MY
MIND, I 'M OFF TO THE DENTIST TO HAVE MY TOOTH STOPPED."
He. "EXCELLENT, DEAR. AND, WHILE HE'S ABOUT IT, ASK HIM
TO STOP YOUR TONGUE ALSO!" [Exit "She who CAI?T be obeyed."
Yet spirits of " the mighty dead"
Are never brought to book.
The Spook we summon in their
stead,
It is an idle Spook.
The words that on his lips are
found
Are trivial and untrue.
The Borderland he hovers round—
Naught else has he to do.
A GLADSTONIAN LAMENT.
THERE is nae luck about the
House,
There is nae luck at a',
There is nae luck about the
House
When our Old Man 'a awa'!
LETTERARY GLADSTONIAN PROS-
PECTS.—Mr. GLADSTONE, during
his retirement, has already com-
menced letter-writing. He began
with an epistle to JONES. It will
of course be followed by two or
three to SMITH, a few to BROWN,
and any number to Sir ROBIN-
SOX D. "N.

But most of us would start,
If you by any chance essayed
To call your heart a heart.

LAND MAXIM.—Always to tell the

able reserve.
MKS. R. has learnt the fashion-
able game, Rubicund Bezique.
A DISPASSIONATE CKITIC.
The Recluse of Brighton Reads and Ruminates:—
HUVPH! Pleasant yet strange, passing strange to read the next
morning of the Parliamentary fray in heu of taking part therein
overnight! Newspapers are more interesting than I imagined.
They do not now entirely consist of abuse of me.' Pretty to observe
how they 're beginning to say pleasant things about me. The next
step I suppose will be to regret me as "a restraining influence."
Fancy a firebrand as a restraining influence! As HORACE says :—
"Sunt quos curricula pulverem Olympicum
Collegisse jurat."
Let's see, how have I translated that? No matter! MS. not here.
I've collected plenty of Olympic dust in my time. How many
"King's Ransoms" I wonder? Now I 'm out of it. So glad! At
least I think I am. Wonder how the new charioteer is getting on.
'' melaque fervidis
Evitata rotis."
(I hope he remembers his HORACE.)
"palmaque nnbilis
Terrarum dominos erehit ad dens.'1''
One of that sort I 've no doubt. General chorus of praise. Not
quite universal though. Suppose the Thersites of Northampton
would translate " Terrarum dominos" House of Lords, and impeach
the oonrtly Venusian as a sycophant.
Well, well, "mobilium turba Quiritium" not masters of majorities
now. What were those jocular line.? someone sent me about "LABBY
in Our Lobby"?
Ha! ha! ha! Never gave my mind—like CANNING and Sir WIL-
FRID—to political doggerel. Perhaps if I 'd stolen a few hours from
HOMER and HORACE to pen squibs for Punch Well, no matter!
Doubtless their doom would have been the W. P. B.! (Reads on.)
Hillo! hillo! What is all this hullabaloo? Government beaten—
on an amendment to the Address—by two votes!!! And on the
motion of Thersites, too!!! Oh, ROSEBERY, oh, Sir WILLIAM, this
is a bad beginning! LABBY in our Lobby indeed? Nothing of the
sort. And what's it all about? Something in ROSEBERY'S speech
to the Peers apparently. What has he been saying? Must see.
r T» j i i
[Reads back.
Tut! tut! tut! What a tempest in a teacup! But why, PRIM-
ROSE, did you go out of your way to "agree" with the Marquis?
Most indiscreet, and unnecessary. Cuts most of the ground from
under our feet, too, I must admit. Dear, dear, dear, tchat a pity a
PRIME MINISTER should ever be ambiguous.' Fatal! just as well
be "inebriated with the exuberance of one's own verbosity." Ah, I
must write to ROSEBERY about this. Half a mind to run up by next
train and put things straight by a little plain speaking. Suppose
that would hardly do, yet. Let's see, what is it HORACE says
again?—
"ambitiosa recidet
Ornamenta, parum clans lucem dare coget,
Arguet ambigue dictum, mutanda notabtt
Fiet ARISTARCBUS."
"He will make him throw light on the parts that are not per-
spicuous; he will arraign what is expressed ambiguously."
Ah, ROSEBEBY, I see I must play the friendly ARISTARCHUS with
you, as old HORACE advises. Whatever you do you must not be
amity nuns. Crede experto.' [Sit« down to write to that effect.
"The paper* and the people all
Make game of little LABBY,
And ray that cheek deserves a fall,
When cheek grows tour and shabby.
He (Wears a Rad who trusts a Peer
Is foolish, false and tnobby.
That'» all my eye! We '11 by-and-by
Find LABBY in our Lobby!"
Two QUERIES.—A most, if not the most explosive Ecclesiastic—
Isn't it the Bishop of Bomb-ay? And, when in full canonicals,
does he wear a dyna-mitre?

A TWICE-TOLD TALE;
OR, THE OLD, OLD STORY.
OUT of the joy and beauty of last night
There grows to shape a spectre of affright,
As o'er the shining wave the sea-fogs creep,
Choking the myriad laughter of the deep,
Slaying the sunshine with their blinding
blight.
All was so fair, with fairer promise yet!
It is no dream, your gladness when we met.
Too humble am I to misread your grace.
Yet was there not a new light in your face,
The light, once seen, that no man will
forget?
Was not your sweet austerity surprised
By tenderness in sympathy disguised,
As when the stubborn winter steals away
In the fair presence of the first spring day,
Smiling through a soft haze, scarce recog-
nised';
Yes, Memory, candid friend, tells nil too true,
That, Herod-like, those infant hopes I slew,
When with the same ingenuous conviction,
The same impromptu grace of air and
diction,
I told the self-same story twice to you.
Was it to you I let it off before,
That brilliant-seeming flash about the floor,
About the floor, and letting things go slide?
Yes, I can see your calm eyes opening wide,
Your mouth's faint quiver pleading Oh, no
more!"
Would I had been a bird whom nature's plan
Prompts to a coda often as they can!
A thrush is wise to show he can recapture,
As BHOWJTING says, his first, fine, careless
rapture,
But thrush's wisdom ia not wise in man!
'Twiit you and me there falls a killing hush.
Severed from human kin and raptured
thrush,
Hated by gods and men, a bore, a bore,
I ne'er can venture, sweet, to woo thee more
In profuse strains of unpremeditated gush.
IN A LADY'S ALBUM.
A Flattering Evasion.
WKRB I but JONES I would strive worthily
To hymn thy praise in soul-pervading
tones. [me—
And laurel laureate wreaths would come to
Were I but JONES.
'Midst piles of girdlecakes and buttered
scones
I sadly sit and drink my cup of tea.
All. all in vain I range the trackless Zones —
The Frigid, Temperate, Torrid, all the
three.
I would sing if I could, and make no bones
Of sonnets bv the score in praise of thee—
Were I but JONES!
MORE APPROPRIATE.—The Clergy Direc-
tory, issued by PHILLIPS of Fleet Street, is
mentioned as a Book of Reference. It ought
to be " A Book of Reverences."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Biirdett's Official Intelligence is out, with the violets and other
blushing evidences of Spring. The little thing is now in its thir-
teenth year, and the amount of information it has garnered would
floor Lord MACATTLAY or any class of his young schoolboys. There
seems to be only one point in which Mr. BUKDETT might add to the
value of his marvellous and, to an important section of the com-
munity, indispensable volume. In addition to fullest particulars
of stocks known to the London Market, and dealt in on the prin-
cipal Exchanges, he tiuotes the Litest prices current. Now, if in a
parallel column he would only give the prices that will be current
this time next year, the already inestimable value of the work
would be materially increased. Perhaps he will think over this
suggestion.
In Outlines (HuiCHiNsoN & Co.), Mrs. HENNIKER has kept her best
wine till the last. All the four stories in the dainty volume are
good, being marked by a purity of style which my Baronite, basely
sheltering himself behind me, ventures to observe is not common
with lady writers. There are scattered sentences which bring to the
pleased senses the sound of the sea, the scent of the gorse, and the
restf ulness of green meadows in which the kine stand. Moreover,
Mrs. HENNIKEU has an unstrained humour that is refreshing. The
Major in the second story is a delightful reality, which Mr. Fludi/er,
the statesman who has a lapse in love, is not. Best of all, save
for its atrocious title, is the last story, which Mrs. HENNIKER, in a
lapse almost as sad as the statesman's, calls " A Sustained Illusion."
It is both powerful and pathetic, a plot DICKENS might have con-
ceived, a story he would nave read with keen appreciation.
The Surrender of Margaret Bellarmine, in two volumes, by
ADELINE SERGEANT, published by Mr. HEIXEMANN, who has been a
bit lucky in his outputs
lately, attracted the Baron's
attention. 'Tis a good title,
and it commences uncom-
monly well, the first chap-
ters being as appetising as
a piquant hore tfccuvre.
"But," quoth the Baron,
"taking it that 'time is
money, then is this story
like a well-sounding in-
vestment, which, after pay-
ing well at first, is gradu-
ally compelled to let the
interest dwindle until we
come to the conclusion—at
the end of vol. II.—that
the concern might have
been wound up long before
with advantage to the in-
vestor." There is a re-
ligious element in it which
is a bit puzzling to the Baron. For example, there is "that saintly
priest Father Larignon, of the Roman Communion," who at one
time seems to be intended to influence the heroine to a consider-
able extent; but he fizzles out and disappears. Then there is
Lady Iiif/oldsthorpe's sister, who is a member of the Community
of St. Hilda's, and is called "Sister MONICA 'in religion,'" and
who is apparently a real genuine nun. She.- too, fades from our
sight. The neroine marries an elderly atheist, and herself becomes
a kind of sentimental Nothingarian, with a sneaking affection for
ecclesiastical lights and hymn-tunes. Later on appears on the
scene a clergyman, who is sometimes styled Father Clermont,
and sometimes Mr. Clermont, but who preaches and conducts the
service in nn Anglican Protestant Church, and on a most solemn
occasion, by the bedside of a dying man, uses a form of words
peculiar to a certain Roman rite. However, any question of a
persuasion "is a mere trifle to this heroine, who can persuade herself
to pretty well anything, and such details as these would have escaped
notice had the story been condensed into one volume, printed
in the same clear type as it is now. But—"Bother sermons in
novels that I take up for amusement," quoth the Baron. "And
now," he continues, ' permit me, in view of leisure time and the
coming Easter holidays, to strongly recommend to your notice a
single-volumed novel, by F P. CAREW, entitled Jim B. 'Tis true
to nature; 'tis a plain unvarnished tale told with dramatic simpli-
city." By the wayt d propot of the Baron's remarks on the clergy-
men as represented in The Surrender of Margaret Sellarmine, here
in the story of Jim B. are two capital parsonic sketches. The heroine
of the story is by no means an exceptional person, though a person
to whom some may take exception. Are there many varieties of the
Jim B. tvpe? Yes: but as a rule they do not end as he ended. The
author of nis being had pity on him. "'Tis an excellent piece of
work, and I strongly recommend it," quoth emphatically,

"THIS FEARFUL STEAD."
SFEXSER.
[Mr. W. T. STEAD hag complacently told the Daily. Xnci interriewer how
rude he was to the ladies of Cnicago. j
A SHIP has arrive.! with a very great man,
Who loves to be adv •jrtised still if he can-
Priceless cargo!
He taught the Old Wcrld what's good, beautiful, true,
And now he 's been doir g the same to the Now
] n Chicago.
He talks with a very superior air—
To hear him, perhaps, little ihildren with their
la ai.d Ma go.
He was, when he spoke in a ir anner so crude
Of rich, idle ladies, uncommonly rude
In Chicago.
How lucky for him he es-
caped Deing ducked,
Or out of the place, by the
populace, chucked i
With " Ta, ta, go
And tell other people tbis
drivelling rot;
You think that we want it,
we simply do not
In Cnicago."
But JONATHAN answered
with tongue, not with
foot,
How sad^that on language like this we can't put
An embargo;
When reading'the elegant things that he said,
We wish they had kept Mr. W. STEAD
In Chicago.

VERY LIKE.—" Carrying on a milling business." a description
given of some parties in a recent case heard before Mr. Justice
KENNEDY, reads to a student of P. R. reports as if the persons in
question were professional pugilists. The word "flour" was omitted
before " milling."
"THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE KINO or THE BELGIANS."—Such
was the heading of a paragraph in the Daily Telegraph last Friday.
Perhaps ere this number be issued some satisfactory news of the
missing monarch will have been received. If not, then perhaps
a more telling advertisement might be headed.—" LOST. ONE
SOVEREIGN. Any one finding the same may keep him at their oicn
expense as long as they like. No further reward.

Sir ROSEBERY the Knight was of right noble blood,
Sing waly, waly. oh!

The Knight had been raised to the highest command,
And entered the lists looking lofty and grand.
".Such choice," quoth the Jester, "/ can't understand!''
Sing waly, tcaly, oh .'
Sir ROSEBERY the Knight entered gay on his course.
'Sing tcaly, waly, oh!
Cried LABBY the Jester, "This knight I '11 unhorse!"
Sing waly, waly, oh.'
So he mounted himself, cap-d-pie, on a pig.
And he pranced in the path of Sir Knight in f ull fig;
And said he, "I will_play this proud champion a rig!"
Stng waly, waly, nh!
Sir ROSEBEHY the Knight rode exceedingly well,
Sing waly, waly, oh!
And he had, as a rule, a firm seat in his telle;
Sing waly, waly, oh!
But whether too proud or too careless, our knight
Was not sitting fast as the pig hove in sight,
And the sorry result was—at least a sore fright.
Sing waly, waly, oh!
For LABBY the Jester sat much at his ease,
Sing waly, waly, oh!
And shook at the Knight a big bladder of peas;

At the porker's hoarse grunt, and the Jester's shrill " Boo!"
And—our Knight in his saddle he lurched all askew,

Ah! sure in the Lists 'twas a piteous sight,
Sing waly, waly, oh.'
To see a knave Jester upset a proud Knight;
Sing waly, waly, oh 7
The Lists laughed aloud, and the ladies turned pale,
To behold a stout champion all covered in mail
Before coxcomb and bladder and porker turn tail!
Sing tcaly, waly, oh!
'Twas but for a jiffy! The^Knight's face flushed scarlet,
Sing waly, waly, oh!
As he settled in saddle, and scowled at the varlet,
Sing waly, waly, oh.'
But knights should be wary, and keep a firm seat,
Nor in stirrups loose dangle negligent feet;
Such a Jesters best jest is at best bitter-sweet,
Sing waly, waly, oh!
NOVEL PICTURES.—"Were an artist totally ignorant of the ways of
our Parliament commissioned to illustrate the descriptive reports,
how would he have represented this incident, graphically given bythe
writer of " Pictures in Parliament"—" When, after prayers, Sir WIL-
LIAM HAKCOURT rose from the Treasury Bench, the House was, with
a single curious exception, densely crowded." Wouldn't the
artist have represented Sir WILLIAM in the act of slowly and
reverently rising from his knees in the presence of a devout
assembly? It would be interesting to see what would be made of
"Pictures in Parliament," by one who had never been inside St.
Stephen's, and who had adopted some ingenious process of "combin-
ing the information."

after considerable deliberation, "I shall send a subscription to the
Irish Association for the Promotion of Intemperance."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SNOBLESSE OBLIGE!
[Mr. PEARCK EUOCCMBE, Liberal Candidate for South Dorset, told
a Teoril audience—'' The only use of making Peers was to get money
for Party purposes. On both the Liberal and Conservative side Peer-
ages were exchanged for live or ten thousand pounds. It was a
well-known fact, and was degrading all round."]
1850.—Quite useless to attempt to conceal from myself the
fact that what I really do aspire to is a Peerage, to tie "Vis-
count," or possibly "Baron," BLA/.ER. Should of course be
glad to do some good work in the world, such as being eminent
statesman, soldier, author, and so on. Still, could do without
those. Can't do without the Peerage. Here goes for it 1
1860.—Have spent last ten years in becoming famous as a
writer. Marvellous success I Confess I was a little doubtful
whether my very introspective and improper novel, called
Topsy TurryriUe, or the Infernal Triplets, would bring me a
reputation or six months in Clerkenwell gaol. It did the
former, mainly. I think, because I had previously made
friends of the Gammon of Writingness in the shape of all the
leading critics. Thought authorship would be a sure road to
rank. And the Government has only made me a C.B.! Dis-
gusted. Shall try something else.
1870.—Last decade spent in Colonies. Made enormous for-
tune out of storing mutton in cold chambers. Question is—-
Will it send me to Upper Chamber? Also become greatest
living authority on Imperial Federation. Home again, and
this time feel pretty confident about the title. Unfortunate
change of Government. New one doesn't care for Federation.
Offers me—a C.M.G.! Not even with the K. before it. Must
begin my Peerage-hunt all over again.
1880.—Have tried .philanthropy. In last ten years given
two public parks, endowed a hospital, been elected President
of five Societies, made no end of speeches, and finished up by
offering to build National Social Home for Epileptic Anarchists.
And all I 've got by it is a statue in Embankment Gardens!
As far off the Viscount as ever, and nearly fifty years old!
1890.—My hopes decay. Given up last ten years to fashion.
Won a Derby, got Royalty to assist at my battues, and always
took care to send pars to the papers saying ttat "Mr. THEO-
DOSIUS BLAZER, C.B., C.M.G., and the Hon. 1
left town for their place in Bedfordshire."
Their "place" sounds so imposing' Who
was it who '' went to his own place ? Must
look it up. My friends consider I 'm lucky.
Say I 've got a "stake in the country." I
have, and I feel tied to that stake. As re-
gards Peerage, no forrarder!
1900.—Hurrah! got it at last! Might
have had it years ago, it seems, if I'd known
how political matters are managed. Needn't
gay much about the subject, but the Elec-
tioneering Fund of the Party to which I belong
has, somehow or other, become richer by ten
thou. Fair exchange is no snobbery. How
true Sjre the poet's words, that " The Rank is
but the Guineas' Stamp ." Send Press notices
that " Viscount and Lady BLAZER are leaving
town for Cairo," and so ends my story of
satisfied social ambition.

They came, those gallant teams, they came,
Each one of those heroic maids
Had vowed to conquer in the game;
Or, even if she failed to win,

Mrs. R. heard her nephew reading out from
the Daily Telegraph of Saturday last how
that " the right honourable gentleman (Mr.
ARTHUR J. BALFOUR) was handicapped to re-
ceive thirteen strokes." "Good Heavens!"
interrupted Mrs. H. "Whatever his faults,
I couldn't believe that such things were done
nowadays I I know he is against the Govern-
ment, and in old days he might have been
brought to the block and beheaded. But
now "And it took all her nephew's
eloquence to pacify her, and to make her

Which decked those damsels, doubly

Though one, malicious spite asserts,
Declined to don the proper hue,
Because—no doubt she was not right—

And then the game—the onslaughts ra*h,
The furious, if erratic, blows
When stick met stick with sounding crash,
Or swiftly fell on hostile toes;
What fiery words, what thrilling cries —
In purest Attic—rent the skies!
Full long and fiercely raged the fray,
Till when at length the game was done,
Cambridge, it proved, had gained the day
By three resplendent goals to one;
And friend and foe and referee
Went, somewhat breathless, home to tea.

Though all their runners gain success,
However well they bat or catch—

(Kirke White very much Up to Date.)
COMMUNICATED TO MR. PUNCH BY A
MODERN MAIDBJJ.
Are—" Why should Iblushtoown Hove?"
WHY should I blush to own I—flirt?
'Tis pleasant, and no soul gets hurt!
Why should I blush to say to all
That flirting holds my heart in thrall?
Why should I seek the staircase shade,
Lest flirting's secret be betrayed?
Why should Ma's brow in sternness move,
Because I practise mimic love P
In dim-leaved green conservatories,
We spoon and tell tremendous " stories";
We fib and mutually flatter,
But after all, what does it matter?
He loves me not, /don't love him.'
Yet in that Eden greenly dim,
After the rapture of the dance,
It seems romantic to—romance!
Pretty pretences, bold " white lies,"
Make up this passing Paradise.
As Eden 'tis a sweet mistake,
But—there's no venom in our snake.
ADAM 's a fraud, and so is EVE,
But then we mutually deceive,
That is, deceice—for all our pother —
Neither oursehet nor one another!
What matters then the pretty flam,
If we are partners in the sham?
And r/hands meet, or may be lips,
'Tis but to part, like passing ships.
Cold is the sparkle, false the glow;
But then it's awfully nice you know!
And makes, like tilting in the ring,
Fine practice for the real thing.'
To look into each other's eyes,
And tell a pack of pretty—lies;
To passionately press hand on hand,
Is—humbug, we both understand.
To sigh, and blush, warm lips to taste,
And madly clasp the mutual waist,
Of course is all mere amorous mockery,
For modern hearts are not like crockery.
But since love-making is an art,
A play in which we 've each a part;
Why, why, despite the chaperon's curse,
Should we not practise and rehearse?
The Flirt just " understudies " Cupid,
And fuss about it all is stupid.
Unless true Marriage is to cease,
Flirting must be "on the increase"!
Is it too naughty then to dwell
On Flirts, who kiss and do not tell?
No, we agree—myself and BEET—
'Tis blameless as 'tis sweet, to flirt!
THE LATEST KIND OF LADY-KILLERS.
(Fraginent from, a Colloquial Hiitory of Modern Times.)
THE members of the Ladies Medical Staff Corps had passed a most
successful inspection. The Surgeon-Field-Marshal-Commanding-in-
Chief was entirely satisfied.
"My dear Madam," said the Doctor to the Lady Colonel-Superin-
tendent, "nothing could be better than your ambulance drill. You
all seem to know now to »et a leg and to bind up a fractured arm.
And now thank you very much indeed, and you may dismiss." •
"Not yet, Surgeon-Field-Marshal-Commanding-in-Chief," replied
the Lady Colonel-Superintendent. "We have something else to
show vou. Now women, fall in!"
And then the females who had been doing so remarkably well as
bearers and hospital orderlies seized their rifles and formed up in
companies. In a moment their commander had drawn her sword and
had placed herself at the head of the battalion. The ladies skir-
mished and charged and resisted cavalry. They even began to fire,
although some of them at this point of the war game put their
fingers in their ears to keep out the noise of the explosions.
Are you not satisfied?" asked the fair commander of her in-
specting officer. "Do you not think we should be useful in the field?"
"Do you mean to loll menP" said the Doctor, replying to one
question by asking another.
"Well, I suppose we should kill men; although that is putting it
rather brutally.
"My dear Madam, women as fighters, are out of place," said the
Surgeon-Field-Marshal-Commanding-in-Chief, courteously, but
firmly. "If there is any killing to be done, take my word for it, you
had better leave it to the doctors."
And the old Surgeon spoke as an expert and gave sound advice.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
"WORDS! WORDS!
WOED8!"
IN the advertised programme
of the last morning perform-
ance of London Ballad Con-
certs, whereat, by the way,
precious few London Ballads
appear to be given, with every
vocal piece of music is given
the name of the composer only,
while that of the writer of the
words that inspired the com-
poser is invariably omitted,
except in one instance, namely,
that of " The Judge"> Song>"
with chorus, sung by Mr.
SANTLEY, to which are ap-
pended the joint names of
GILBERT and SULLIVAN, which
is the proper order wherein
they should appear, seeing
that words come first and
music follows. But why omit
the names of the word-mon-
gers of all the other songs on
the list? Why, for example,
is " The Fight Watch" an-
nounced as by "PlNSUTl,"
when it ought to have been
"by FRANK FBANXFOBT
MooBEandPlNSUTl"? Again,
why not "O Ruddier than
the Cherry" by "GAT and
HANDEL" instead of by
"HANDEL" alone? Should
not "WEATHERLEY" share
with " MOLLOT" such success
as has been achieved by " To-
morrow will be Friday "?
And how comes it that the
author of the beautiful " Lost
Chord" that inspired SULLI-

VAN'S melody should in the
programme be nameless, un-
less it be omitted on the erro-
neous supposition that the
majority everywhere know
that it is the inspired work of
Miss ADELAIDE PROCTOB?
This omission is customary,
but it is a custom that would
be more honoured in the breach
than in the observance, and
librettists owe a debt of grati-
tude to Mr. W. S. GILBEBT for
vindicatingtheirright of being
named in the same programme
with the composers. The libret-
tist of Pinafore and other
works has invariably stuck
up for the rights of the
"words." Further, he has
always stuck to the principle,
as between librettist and com-
poser, of "honours divided,"
and "forces combined." He
has persistently adhered to
that immortal incident of
Equality and Fraternity which
is embodied in that motto of
eternal verity "Share-and-
share-alike!"

A NEW CASE ADDED LAST
WEEK TO THE VARIED COLLEC-
TION IN THE BRITISH MusErM.
—" The Libel Case."
HOUSE OF COM-
MONS, Monday,
March 12.—For
first timeinapro-
cession of Par-
liaments striding
through sixty-
two years, Mr. G.
is not here when
business of new
Session opens.
Though his pre-
sence is lacking,
his fame and
what ROSEBERY
calls his trans-
cendent person-
ality fill both
Houses. Eventhe
Lords discreetly
murmur ap-
plause when the
MARKISS, mo-
mentarily forget-
ful of great gulf
that separates
him from the po-
litical adversary,
pays tribute to
the most bril-
liant intellect de-
voted to the ser-
vice of the State
since Parlia-
mentary Government began." A nne passage in KGSEBERY'S speech
where he likens the great statesman to " some noble river that has
gathered its colours from the various soils through which it has
passed, but has preserved its identity unimpaired, and gathered
itself in one splenoid volume before it Breasts the eternal sea."
This very good for the Lords, aa aujpiet body Mr. G. has just
declined his Sovereign's invitation to join. In the Commons the

loss more acutely felt, the ffrief more poignant, the lamentation the
louder. Hon. gentlemen in the corner under the Gallery, which
Mr. MELLOR cannot see from the Chair, manage with manly effort
to control their emotion when they look across at Mr. G.'s seat and
find it filled bv drooping figure of SQUIRE OF MALWOOD. Prince
ABTHUB is unaffectedly touched at the severance of long and illus-
trious companionship. He, at least, has no self-reproach as he looks
back on his association with the Great Master. He has ever main-
tained that high standard of public life he admired in Mr. G., and
even in moments of fiercest party conflict has observed the great
House of Commons traditions on which, as he truly said, are based
no small part of the dignity and utility of the Assembly. One of the
highest and most cherishea was worthily observed in the eloquent
touching tribute which the young Leader of the Opposition laid at
the feet of the veteran statesman, whom a few days back he faced
across the Table, taking up with almost fierce gesture the challenge
Mr. G., by way of farewell, flung at the House of Lords.
The SQUIBE OF MALWOOD'S eulogy was worthy of its place in.the
quartette. Its very best point was the unprepared one at which he
broke down, stood silent with bowed head as he looked upon the
vanishing figure of "the glorious and venerated chief, to us the
kindest and most constant friend." House not accustomed to find
the SQUIRE in melting mood. More used to watch him whipping up
foes (and sometimes mends) with the scorpion of his ready wit. To
see him wrestling with this rush of emotion a revelation to those
who know him only at the Treasury, and are accustomed to see his
face when he is asked for another thousand or two of public money
for current expenses. Business done.—Address moved.
Tuesday.—" In the words of Scripture," Mr. FIELD observed,
further filling out that shirt front whose voluminous whiteness is
the pride of the Irish Cattle Traders and Stock Owners Associa-
tion, ot which he is President; "In the words of Scripture," he
repeated, pulling into fuller view the shirt-cuffs that even from
Monday to Saturday throw an air of respectability over the National
Federation of Meat Traders, of which he is V ice-President; "In
the words of Scripture," here he lightly touched the glossy raven
locks which, brushed back from his brow, and hanging over his coat
collar, lend a certain subtle Byronic flavour to the Dublin Victuallers
Association, of which he is Honorary Secretary; "In the words of
Scripture, the conduct of the Government is sound and fury,
signifying nothing."

"The Great Mogul."
Some lack of generosity in this gibe, uttered at this particular
moment. Government momentarily on its back. Not the time that
one would imagine so heroic a figure as that of the Member for St.
Patrick Division of Dublin would select to spurn it. 'Twas the SAGE
OF QUEEN ANNE'S GATE who laid it there; brought on amendment
to Address praying QUEEN to kindly "end" the Lords. Nothing
serious anticipated; SAGE got on hand a few sparkling paragraphs
which he would distribute, and then House, amused, would get to
business. Expected this last and least important step would not be
taken before ten o'clock; Members back then- so went off to dinner.
The SAOE glancing round discovered position. If he divided at
once he would
; : . have Ministers on
the hip. Sud-
denly turned off
the tap of talk;
division taken
in dinner-hour,
and new Govern-
ment, on second
day of new Ses-
s i o n, found
themselves in
minority of two.
"What are
you going to
do?" PRINCE
ARTHUB blandly
inquired across
the Table. "We
are going on with
our business."
answered the
Sui IKK OF MAL-
WOOD. with the
genial smile and
airy manner
which character-
ised the well-
known Spartan
who went about
with a fox gnaw-
ing his entrails. "Oh no, you're not," said JOSEPH, sweetly, from
the back bench. "I will move the adjournment, then you can sleep
on the matter, and tell us at noon what you think of it.
This was after one o'clock in the morning. No use fighting;
SQUIRE, shaking with genial laughter (or was it the fox taking a fresh
bite ?), promptly agreea.
Business done.—Arranged that Debate on Address should be closed
to-night. "Instead of which," as the Judge once said, Govern-
ment have been defeated. House finds itself unexpectedly plunged
into Ministerial crisis.
Wednesday.—On ordinary Wednesdays at quarter past twelve
House a desert; Whips waylay Members in Lobby to form a quorum,
so that SPEAKER may take the Chair; Sergeant-at-Arms, with
sword drawn, perambulates Committee Rooms, poking the arras in
likely places if peradventure he may prick POLONIUS, M.P., thereby
inducing him to show himself and help to make a House.
On stroke of noon to-day House crowded; Members still stream-
ing in till every bench tilled, and throng clustered at the Bar. What
will Ministers do? The usual three courses PRINCE ARTHUR has
found for them, with one over. Treat the SAGE'S amendment with
contempt; reverse it; resign; dissolve. Which shall it be? Fully
500 Members crane the neck to hear the message the SQUIRE brings
from the Cabinet. In funereal dress and solemn mood he slowly
reaches conclusion, which announces that Address, embarrassed
by SAGE'S supplementary remarks touching1 Lords, shall be dropped
and new one moved. "I will move it myself," said the SQUIRE, chil-
ling the hopes of young Members on Ministerial benches who thought
since there were to be two Addresses in one Session they might
still have a chance of coming to the front. PRINCE ARTHUR merci-
lessly chaffed the Ministry, but offered no objection to the course.
Rather the wounded Ministry might turn to hiin and his Party with
confidence that they would save them from their friends.
When the SQUIBE rose to move new Address in reply _ to gracious
Speech from the Throne, JOHN MORLET, another promising young
member, preparing to second it, SAUXDERSON interposed. Was it in
order, he asked the DEPUTY-SPEAKER, for the CHANCELLOR OF THE
EXCHEQUER moving the Address to scout immemorial custom and
fail to present himself in uniform according to his rank? Was
sure House would be ready to adjourn for twenty minutes to give
right hon. gentleman an opportunity of getting into military or other
uniform. If glances were swords," said DAVID PLUNKET, looking
across at the SQUIKE eyeing the Colonel, "SAT/N^ERSON would be a
dead man." Btninefn done.—New Address carried. Cri«is over.
Thursday.-—Thought to have a quiet night. Began well; promised
to close peacefully; in the middle an eruption. It 'was the SAOE
OF QUEEN ANNE'S GATE again. Murmuring about Matabeleland,
he was interrupted by ironical cheer from ELLIS ASHSTEAD-BABTLETT
(Knight). SAGE turned upon him with bland ferocity. Declared
that as usual he knew nothing about the matter, his political stock
in trade being vague abuse of Liberals, and a general waving of
the British flag, though he was an American -not a British citizen."
Later the gallant Knight protested, in hearing of interested Com-
mittee, that his " ancestry were entirely English." SAGE bound to
admit that a not uncommon incident with gentlemen born in the
United States. He therefore withdrew his remark. For the time
silence fell, but gore must ensue. Pistols (or lances) for two, and a
vacancy either in Northampton or Sheffield is regarded in Whips'

"I know that man; he coint* from Sheffield."
room as inevitable consequence of the episode. Difficulty for
lookers on to understand why the SAGE should think American
citizenship a reproach, or why the Knight, formerly of Brooklyn,
U.S.A., should resent it as such.
Business done.—Supplementary estimates agreed to.
Friday.—In Committee of Supply; Army Estimates under discus-
sion; vote a mere fleabite of £5,981,000 to meet expenses of British
Army during coming year. A pretty large order; attendance
scarcely commensurate; no one looking round empty benches would
imagine that, not to dwell on trilling amount of sum named, safety
of Empire is at stake. AaifOLD-FoBSTEB not at all satisfied. Navy
pleases him not nor the Army either. Still, members drop out to
dress for dinner, the worloT goes round, CAMPBELL-BANNERMAIT
cracks his little ioke, the bill is ordered to be paid, the British Army
marches out, ana so home to bed.
Business done.—A good deal. .
"WHY CERTAINLY!"—There appeared quite recently in the
Observer an article on "Coming Costume." Now though this was
not labour lost; yet what may be A Coming Costume is not so in-
teresting to ladies as what is the Be- Coming Costume.
AFTER THE BOAT-RACE.—Writes an expert in the St. James's
Gazette, "The style of Oxford is undeniably good, saving some
feather under water of three of the oars." Very low feathering
this. But the Oxonian winners were all in uncommonly "high
feather" afterwards.
MOTTO FOR FRAUDULENT BANKRUPT.—As you make your books
so you must lie in them, and sleep as comfortably as you can in your
own balance-sheets, which will never be sufficiently well-aired—if
you can help it.
THB PLACE FOR MR. LABOTOHERE TO SPEND A HAPPY DAY.—

POPULAR SONGS RE-SUNG.
THE CONDUCTOR'S EYE.
AIR—" The Speaker's Eye."
[" Minor grievances, in their sum, muke the greatest sorrows of life.
Here is one, and not the smallest. I can never be sure of catching the eye
of the conductor of nn omnibus."
Letter by " rant Forty Year," in the "Daily JVi«."]
MB. SIDNEY BROWN was a worth}' "old
bloke."
Who lived in a suburb out of London's
smoke.
He had 'bus'd it to town for thirty year,
Till his legs pot shaky, and his sight grew
queer.
But though he stuck to his shop like a
leech,
Times changed with him as they changed
with each;
For he found of late, howsoe'er ho 'd try,
He could seldom eatch the Conductor's eye.
He seldom could catch—
(Whistle) O phew! O phew!
O phew!
He hardly could catch—
O phew! O phetr! O phew.'
He found it hard, confound it, yes,
To catch the Conductor's eye!
The " ead " was once on the footboard found,
Keeping of a sharp look-out around,
But now he went clambering across the
roof,
With a ting-ting clipper for the passenger's
oof;
Collecting fares with his musical clips,
Or chatting with the driver about sporting
tips.
Poor BHOWN would whistle, wave his ging-
ham, and cry,
But he could not catch that Conductor's eye!
He could not catch, &c.
He would stand on the kerbstone till his
. feet grew cold,
A-hailing of the 'busses that unheeding
rolled.
The driver whipped on with disdainful pride.
As though the Conductor had yelled Full
hinside!"
When he looked at his watch BROWX was
sick at heart,
For fear for his suburb he should never make a start.
He 'd shout and he 'd whistle, and he 'd cry out " Hi'."
But he could not catch the Conductor's eye.
He could not catch, &c.

And if by chance he obtained a seat,
His conflobustieation seemed vet more complete,
For when he wanted near his nome to alight.
The Conductor was quite certain to be out of sight.
He would whack with his brolly on the roof, and shout,
But once in that 'bus, 'twasn't easy to get out.
A quarter of a mile past his villa tney would fly,
Ere BUOWN could catch the Conductor's eye.
He could not catch, &c.
Poor BROWS would sit with his Gladstone
and his rug
A-dreaming of old days so serene and snug.
When the good old "knifeboard" had not
to compete
With spiral stairway and with garden-seat.
When the genial Conductor was ever on his
board,
And time for pleasant gossip with his fares
could afford;
Ere the punch and the ticket made it vain
to try
To catch an invisible Conductor's eye.
He could not catch, &c.
One night, at the close of a dreary drowse,
BROWN found he had travelled half a mile
past his house;
He tugged at the strap, and he yelled till
hoarse,
To attract the Conductor—on the roof, of
course!
Then he grasped his gingham, and he stag-
gered to the door,
And prodded at space for a minute or more,
Till at last, lunging out with a fiendish cry.
He caught the Conductor—bang in the eye!
At last he 'd caught, &c.
Then an awful silence tilled that 'bus,
Whilst the blinded Conductor began for to
cuss.
He writhed and squirmed and screwed his
face,
And punched a penny ticket in the two-
penny place.
At last he cried, " You jolly old guv!
You've stuck your brolly in mv nloomin'
heye!''
Then BROWN he chortled with extreme
delight,
And said, "Confound you, and it scrres t/uit
right!
\ 've caught at last—(whistles)
I 've caught at last—(whistles)
At last, hooray! I 've been and gone.
And caught the Conductor's eye!"
TAYS FROM THE LINKS.
A "THREE-CARD LAY."
LONG ago in sweet September,
Oh! the day I well remember,
I was playing on the Links against the
winsomest of maids:
In a " cup" my ball was lying,
And the " divots" round were Hying,
And with eyes a-dancc she said to me, "Your
iron's the King of Spades!"
Now a foe, on such occas-ion,
Of the feminine persuasion,
Fair and twenty to the game a sort of
subtlety imparts;
And I felt its potent glamour,
And I answered with a stammer
Shy and nervous, "It was rash of me to play
the Queen of Hearts!"
Any further explanation
Of my inward admiration
Very likely had exposed me to the deadliest
of snubs;
But a snigger from behind me
Just in time came to remind me
Of the presence of my caddie—and I blessed
the Knave of-Ctobs !• • -
Mits. K. ox FISH DIET.—Our good friend
has heard that many diseases can be traced
to eating tii-h not absolutely fresh. "It's
very likely," observed Mrs. 11. thought-
fully, "though it never occurred to me till
now to ask from what illness a herring had
been suffering previous to its being cured.
But I never again will eat any fish unless it
can be guaranteed as quite fresh and well,
or that it has been thoroughly cured. By the
way, I know there arc horse-doctors and
dog-doctors, are there any regularly certifi-
cated fish-doctors'?" Her nephew suggested
that if there were, they would be known as
"Physh-icians." Mrs. U. objected that he
never could be serious for a minute; and for
her part her motto as to this fish question
would always be that "What can't be cured
oughtn't to be endured."

Those feet trip smart and skittish.

But our Hornpipe beats 'em—easy '.

A LAY OF EASTER EGGS.

I NOT the Great Auk itself, not SindbatVs Roc,

As Liberal Love has added to my stock
This Easter Day!
Some Moa—nay, that's too much like some

My eggs are full,
But not of meat; a miscellaneous store;
All care could cull
From Sindbad's valley—or a jeweller's shop,
Toyman or cutler;
The sweet pearl pendent or the diamond drop;
Or, sweeter, subtler,
The rubied golden circlet; garters, gloves
(WHEELER'S and DENT'S);
Brooches and bangles, bracelets, lockets —
loves!
Kerchiefs and scents.
On all the season's joys, without expense
I am a fcaster!
Ah! of all poultry I prefer the hens
That lay at Easter!

TO AN EAELY-EISING SPAEEOW.
A Lie-a-bed Lay by the Lazy L\ef.
DfsjY little specimen of common ornithology,
Why this early rising from your elevated nest?
Surely, dirty dickey-bird, you owe me an apology,
Cutting short the heaven of a Club-frequenter's rest.
True, your situation is rather mortary and bricky, bird,
Lending little comfort to a dissipated head;
Still, it is not absolutely necessary, dickey-bird,
Thus to tell your neighbours when you''re getting out of bed.
Why should you, a sparrow, have
your every movement signified?
Don't imagine, dickey, that all
insects are the same.
Beetles have a manner that is emi-
nently dignified,
So have other creatures that I
hesitate to name.
Move they on their missions with
funereal solemnity,
Emulating Somnus by their quiet-
ness and tact,
You, because your wings afford
aerial indemnity,
Seem to think it clever to be rather
less exact.
Cease, I beff, that chirruping, like
unrepaired machinery—
Squeaking, whose intensity all
other noises drown;
If you are excited at the absence
here of greenerv,
Surely there is plenty in the or-
chards out of town!
If a Jack of worms and things immediately distresses you,
Worms and things can always be discovered on the ground!
Truly, 'tis a puzzle to imagine what possesses you,
Dickey-bird, to make this most abominable sound.
Say you that the remedy I hold, and have neglected it?
Hint you that, if up and dressed, I would not heed your squeak?
That's your ignorance, you know. I must say I expected it!
That's the way you lower classes generally speak?
Does it not occur to you that you and I proceed to bed
Scarcely at a similar position of the sun,—
You, when he is setting, showing readiness to speed to bed:
/, when he his lighting job has only just begun?
Probably you '11 tell me that I ought to sing a glee with you,
Welcoming the da\yning of another blessed day?
There, my young ornithic friend, I wholly disagree with you;
Nothing would induce me to go on in such a way—
Save if by some awkward transmigrationary blundering,
I should ever find myself inclined to do it too:
Then, no doubt, the world would have another fellow wondering
Why /wasn't slaughtered—as I 'd like to slaughter you!
"YES," says Mrs. R., "I like the spring, with its violets and
primroses; but for colouring, give me the autumn tinctures!"

AU REVOIR TO PANTOMIME.
THE Pantomime Season is over in London. Provincially, the Pan-
tomime Plant sometimes flourishes for some time longer. We have
had two Pantomimes, one at Drury Lane and one at the Lyceum, and
both must have been more or less damaged at first by the gigantic
show of Constantinople marvellously
worked by Bossr KIBALFY. At
the Lyceum, Cinderella was much
nearer the extravaganza of ancient
VESTKIS and MATHEWS djiys, the
days of PLANCHE and DANCE, for
PLANCHE did so much work alone
that to bring in a DAXCE was quite
a relief to him—than it was to a
modern Pantomime. It was in two
acts; which is a novelty, as Panto-
mimes are not usually in acts, and
in this respect it resembled some
of the ancient, elegant, fairy-tale
extravaganzas; and it could have
done perfectly well, if not better,
without the Harlequinade.
The "Harlequinade" is not
played out if it could only have
some startling mechanical changes
and some really good comic scenes for Clown and Pantaloon. It
is not played out if, in addition to fulfilling the above require-
ments, it could be made to form part and parcel of the story,
if the transformation scene were not made the culminating point
of the show, and if the entire performance, beginning at a reason-
able hour, say eight, could be over by eleven to the minute. At
the same time an extravaganza, which means a fairy story
prettily and well played, well sung, without any music-hall ditties,
and with the most fanciful transformation scenes and the most
grotesque changes that can be imagined and effectively given,
would be as safe to attract as did those of "long, long ago,'
which Mr. OSCAB BAHEETT evidently took as his model. This
style of thing would not do for Drury Lane, cela ra sans dire, or for
Covent Garden, but for a theatre like the Lyceum.

A VADE MECUM TOE "MORTAE-BOARDS."
(Compiled by a Bigot with rather strong Prejudices.)
Question. Why should London have an University?
Answer. Because Oxford and Cambridge are within an hour or so
of town.
Q. Have not the colleges on the Isis and thelCam been hitherto
considered sufficient?
A. Certainly; and that is the reason why London is to have col-
leges of her own.
Q. Of whom will the governing body be composed?
A. Of all sorts and conditions of men. The London County Council
are to fraternise with Convocation, and the Inns of Court are to pull
together with the Physicians and the Surgeons.
Q. Can you say from what quarter the
first row will emanate?
A. Probably from the Surgeons, who had
a dreadful quarrel in Lincoln's Inn Fields
only a year or so ago.
Q. Will the Inns of Court get on nicely?
A. Not if they squabble as much about
the University Government as they have over
their Bar examinations.
Q. Are not the British Museum and the
Royal Agricultural Society also to be repre-
sented?
A. Certainly; and no doubt the spokes-
men of these two "interests" (with the kind
assistance of the Engineers and the Mercers)
will make confusion worse confounded.
Q. What advantages are expected from the carrying out of the
scheme?
A. That Upper Tooting College will compete with Trinity, Cam-
bridge, and Lower Bayswater Hall challenge comparison with Christ
Church, Oxford.
Q. And what effect will the Town Establishment have upon "the
Blues"—dark and light?
A. None.
Q. Do you mean to say that Oxford and Cambridge will hold
their own?
A. Certainly. Men who would have gone to the Universities on
the Isis and the Cam will " continue the movement," while those who
wouldn't will be satisfied with "the 'Varsity" on the Lower Thames.

Mr. Stage Manager (aside). Dear, dear! They want a dea 1 of

men, fall into places, if you please. Curtain's just about to be rung
up for the Grand Tableau

Most important, you know, we should show no disunion in doing it.
Miss Cambria (pettish!//). Oh, that's all very well, but I'm
awfully uncomfortable in this position. Can't I come just a shade
more to the front.
Miss Hibernia (aside). Oh. of course.' Forward, puss! Thinks
to put me in the background, I suppose. We shall see. (Aloud.)
You know you told me, Mr. MANAGER, that I should
Mr. Stage Manager. Oh yes, yes, yes! That will be all right.
But I must group you so as to get the best effect from the front.
A little less stitf, if you please, Mr. BULL!
Mr. Bull. Humph! If I'd been stiff, as you call it, I should
have stood out altogether, I think. I 've been in the background
long enough. Miff, indeed!
Mr. Sandy. Well, you do look a little wooden, JOHN, I must say.

Mr. Stage Manager. Now gentlemen, please, no talking. This is

Miss Hibernia. Unite so, Mr. MANAGER! Mr. BULL alirays

Mitt Cumbria. I hate such arrogant, bouncing ways! Better be
"little," /think, provided you are also " gallant." [Bridles.
Mr. Sandy. He. he! Fancies he can do the " United Kingdom"
all by himself, and that the other figures do not count. Won't even
learn that England doesn't mean Great Britain, often as I have to
remind him of it. [Chuckles.
Mr. Bull (loftily). Bah! you're a cantankerous, separatist, pro-
vincial, unpatriotic lot! [Snorts.
Mr. Stage Manager. Pray, pray ladies and gentlemen, stop talk-
ing, and take your respective positions.
All. Yes, but what are our respective positions?
'Mr. Stage Manager. I will show you. (Arranges the four figures
in an impressive group, pushing this one forward a little, rery gently
pushing another a shade back, straightening a back here, bending a
limb there, turning a face, lifting a chin, shaping a drapery}.
There! That's better. Except the expressions of your faces. They
will nerer do! Smile, Mr. BULL, as in proud, placid confidence.
Xo, no, that's the pride without the placidity. Look boldly out, but
do not clench your jaws or knit your brows. And you, Mr. SANDY,
a shade less sourness—if I may say so—would make you look more
genial and—ahem !—Scotch! Not quite so much prickly thistley

dear, as the prominent figure •

Mr. Stage Manager (blandly and deprecalingly). in this par-
ticular tableau, for the moment, do not hide more of the other figures
with your cloak and hat than you are obliged to. And now, if you
please, all of you, fancy you are having your photos taken for your
—ahem!—sweethearts, and look as pleasant as erer you can .'
All. Oh, I daresay! When we are all as cramped and uncomfort-
able as possible!
Mr. Stage Manager (gcntlt/). Well, you know, tableaux are
always just a little trying—to the muscles and nerves. But I do
want our " Living Picture" to be a success, and I 'm sure you will
all share with me the desire that it should be so. Now, then, do not
shift or change your relative positions, and, oh! Miss HIIIEHNIA
(seductirely) before I rin? up the C'urtain, just a leetle shade further
back, if you please, my dear!
(Curtain rises.)
Ctmious OPERATION.—In a recent Scotch trial held at the Court
of Session. Edinburgh, Lord KYLLACIIT, in answer to a question,
replied, "I do not think I can compel the witness to be precognosed."
Mrs. R. was much puzzled on reading this. Of Pug-nosed, Roman-
nosed, Grecian-nosed, Snub-nosed persons she has heard, and knew
some personally. But they were born so, and she should like to ask
what possible law there could be, even in Scotland—which was, she
believed, still a snuff-taking country—that could compel a change
in anybody's nose.

IV.—" PRICE SIXPENCE."
I sixs a song, it has been done
before;
I could not (if I would) with
truth deny it.
We have our minor poets by the
score,
Who make somehow a decent
living by it.
In point of fact I do myself—
that's more
Or less, and so could you were
you to try it.
It's pleasant thus to earn (when
in a fix) pence,
So that is why I sin? a Song of
Sixpence.
Oh, not for me (I 'm glad to say)
to sing
Of that abnormal poeketftil of
rye;
I fondly hope and quite believe
the King-
Used language suitable to such
a pie.
No doubt he stormed and swore
like anything,
And blew the wicked cock up
—to the sky.
My song is different. Somehow
Nursery Rhymes
Seem quite unsuited to these
modern times.
With Sixpence now you pet a
ladies' journal,
News-crammed up to the very
brim, where no thing
Too sacred is to print. It seems

Is woman's interest in her—

A HOIIDAY TASK FOR THE EASTIR VACATION.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—As you always look after us fellows, will you
say a good word for us at Easter? Everyone knows that we don't
have too many holidays, but it seems a beastly shame to handicap
the little vacation we are allowed by setting us holiday tasks.
However it we are to have them, let us answer them as we please,
in a cheery, light-hearted spirit appropriate to the occasion. To teach
you what I mean I will jot down a few questions to show you how
I think they ought to be treated, and when I write myself I feel
sure that I am speaking for a lot of chaps who share my opinion.
HOLIDAY QUESTIONS WITH MODEL ANSWERS.
HlSTOET,
Question. Who was WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR?
Answer. A Johnny who came over to England to have a tussle
with HAEOLD, and got the best of it at Hastings.
Q. What was the result of the Battle of Hastings?
A. That everything was made ship-shape for no end of a time, and
consequently caused it to be unnecessary to consider events until the
reign of QUEEN VICTOIUA.
Q. What do you know about the Normans?
A. Chaps in armour, who became the ancestors of anyone claiming
respectability at the end of the Nineteenth Century.
Q. What were the provisions of Magna Charta'?
A. Not generally known, but if there were a luncheon rarty at
Runnymede, probably venison from the New Foiest.
Q. Who was RICHARD THE Fiitsi?
A. A King of England who was fond of music. He killed a lion,
was taken prisoner, and discovered by BI.UXDEL, probably from
MAPLES. Fond of fighting, and was a friend of Sir WALTER SCOTT,
who put him in Iranhoe.
Q. Give the principal events from the commencement of the reign
of CKABLES THE FIRST up to the present time.

A. Eton, Harrow, Winchester, Westminster, Rugbj^Marlborough,
Cheltenham, Foisted, Radley, Godalming, and West Kensington.
Q. Specify the principal exports and imports of Great Britain.
A. Don't know.
Q. What causes the creation of an itland in latitudes ^here
volcances are in constant eruption?
A. Don't care.
There, Mr. Punch, if we might floor our papers as above
mentioned, a holiday tatk would become quite a little holiday
pleasure. Do your best for us. We always take you in during
term time, and, when we come home, get the governor to buy a
couple of copies—one for himself, one for us. So you see you owe us
something. One good turn deserves another.
Your affectionate little friend, JONES MINOR.

And send us not to inundated graves,
With cough and cold, consumption and catarrh.

nation.
"ADVICE GRATIS."
MY BEAR BRIEFLESS,—I have long been puzzled by the want of
success accorded to you in our mutual profession. This is certainly
not the result of lack of assiduity on your part. You are punctual
and regular in your attendance in Court. On the occasions when
you have addressed it, so far as my experience goes, you have shown
yourself equal to the occasion. It is true that I personally only re-
member two such, but doubtless there have been many others.
Those to which I allude are, first, when you rose in the Queen's
Bench Division to complain of a draught, and Mr. Justice at
once granted your application, and made an order directing the
usher to close a window. Second, when, being the senior barrister
6resent, you rose to congratulate Mr. Baron on his return to the
ench. "(He had risen, you will remember, half an hour earlier than
the usual time on the previous afternoon, owing to a somewhat
premature increase to his domestic responsibilities.)
It is true that his Lordship, after you had spoken, observed that
"it was a private matter, and ougnt not to form the subject of
public allusion " ; but I can never forget the dignity with which
you replied, "My Lord, that which concerns you concerns the
nntinn" You had, I remember, resumed your seat even before
His Lordship requested you to do so. So
that the report, as it appeared in the
papers, that you were "ordered to sit
down," "and resumed your seat accord-
ingly," is not correct.
How is it, then, that your efforts have
not been crowned with success V My dear
BRIEFLESS, you will not be offended with
me if I sugg'est that your personal appear-
ance is not sufficiently impressive. I illus-
trate what I mean. Your forensic costume
is correct, your dress appropriate, your
whiskers arc according to a well-known and
universally accepted pattern, "the mutton
chop." But you lack, dare I say the word,
"Devil," or rather "go" ("go" is better, and I adopt it). Now
my idea is that, with your undoubted ability, it is worth while
making a series of experiments in your personal appearance, with
the view of ascertaining whether the success yen undoubtedly
deserve can any longer be denied to
you. In jirinn's, you must sacrifice your
whiskers. I know this may bring
trouble at liome; but if the importance
of the situation is urged, I fancy the
opposition will give way, or at any rate
compromise, for moustaches to be grown
at the sea-side during the Long Vacation.
I remember a friend of mine who
sacrificed his moustaches on taking silk,
overcoming a good deal of hostile do-
mestic feeling by having them mounted
on a Christmas curd with some appro-
priate verses. I don't see why you
should not do something in this line
with your whiskers. Hariris' -got-rid
of the' whiskers, I would" suggest th»t
you should put yourself into the hands
of an expert, like Mr. CLAKKSON, the theatrical pcrmquier, in


order that you may appear as the spry, incisive barrister. The
wig must be uncurled, and rendered less formal, but your collars
and bands must be as stiff as
starch can make them. CLARK-
SON will give you a heavy eye-
brow, and you will wear a glass.
Your manner will be short and
sharp, your gestures quick and
emphatic, you will not brook
contradiction, and your power
of self-assertion must be un-
limited.
I have great faith in this type,
but should it fail after a fair
trial, I would recommend the
following change. The wig
should be straightened out. The
heavy eyebrow removed, the glass
l^d aside. CLARKSON should
Pr°dnce you as the jocular genial
counsellor. This should be
achieved by raising the colour
of, and bringing into prominence,
your cheek; a slight redness on
the nose indispensable in true comedy. You will assume a quaint
and quiet mien; but your eye must twinkle (CLARKSON will see to this).
The last type that I would suggest to
you in this letter as worthy of a trial
is the erudite counsel, for this character
you will require whiskers, but not the
formal pattern you now wear. They
must be irregular and struggle}'. The
face a good deal lined, and heavy
spectacles: collar and bands limp.
Affect to be suffering from short sight,
and let your excellent clerk see that you
are regularly supplied in Court with
legal works, black letter preferred,
which you will diligently study about
three inches from your nose.
My dear BRIEFLESS, I shall be anxious to learn what you think of
my suggestions, and to give you others should these fail after fair
trial. Yours, WELL-WISHER.


PHILANTHROPY A LA MODE.
A SITTING for the Public Examination of the Directors and Officers
of the Children's Benevolent Bank was held recently before the Pre-
siding Authority. Although eighty witnesses were required to appear,
only the Secretary attended. It transpired that the Institution was
registered for the purposes of transacting the business of bankers and
money lenders. The insolvency of the Bank was attributed to its
funds having been advanced on inadequate or worthless securities.
The Secretary, having been called, was examined by the Presiding
Authority. He said he was appointed pro tern., but had nothing to
do with the composition of the prospectus. Two hundred million
prospectuses were issued in China, Japan and other charitable com-
panies. The alleged object of the Bank was to assist infants of
tender years at times of pecuniary difficulty.
The Presiding Authority. Was not the prospectus a combination
of cant and cuteness?
The Witness admitted that such was the case. He was not respon-
sible for the prospectus. That was the work of the promoter, who
received two-thirds of the shares as a consideration for the trouble he
had taken in establishing the Institution. The other shares, worth
apparently £100 each, were issued at a very considerable discount.
The Presiding Authority. Is it not a fact that some of the £100
shares were sold at twopence a-piece?
The Witness was not prepared to answer that question in the
affirmative. However, he had certainly heard (on reliable authority)
that some of the shares were purchased at the sum per share of
twopence halfpenny. He did not consider this a disproportionate
sum for the value of the investment.
The Presiding Authority. Why did the Promoter receive two-
thirds of the shares of the Institution?
The Secretary. For forming and floating the Company.
The Prcxidinii Authority. And what became of the funds that
were actually received by issuing the debentures at the large discount
you h;i\c mentioned?
The Secretary, They were sent to the Promoter.
The Presiding Authority. And where is that official?
The Secretary. I believe that he is residing abroad.

BETWEEN THE (SUNDAY) SHOWS.
SCENE— The West End. TIME—Between Show Sunday and Studio
Sundat/. PRESENT—Tiro Art Enthusiasts.
First Art Enthusiast. Yes; we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly.
We took a fly, and went first to Chelsea, and did it thoroughly, and
then to the Regent's Park, and did it
thoroughly too.
Second Art Enthusiast. Well, we
only had a cab. You see as the studios
are in groups, it is so easy to go from
one place to another, and then walk.
It was really most amusing.
First A. E. Yes; I always like the
fun. You see the same people at each
place. They come up regularly until
you quite begin to know them.
Second A. E. Yes, just as if you
were on board ship and saw them every
day. And that s why I think you
should dress very quietly.
First A. E. 1 quite agree with you.
There was an arrangement in green and yellow which palled upon us
terribly before the day was done. We quite liked it the first time
we saw it. But it grew so terribly monotonous. We saw it fourteen
times.
Second A. E. Yes, and you must look at a startling costume. It
attracts your attention in spite of all your efforts to look at some-
thing else.
First A. E. Quite so; for what else have you to look at if you
don't examine the dresses? Of course, if you meet friends, you can
talk to them.
Second A. E. Exactly. That 's what we did. We met the
SOLKERINO SMITHS, and chatted all the afternoon with them. We
got into the stream, and were carried away with it. We drifted
from place to place most charmingly.
First A. E. That must have been very nice; because, after all, it
it rather dull spending a whole afternoon in doing nothing in
particular.
Second A. E. Well, you can scarcely call it nothing in particular,
because it is quite the thing to do. Besides, one must be somewhere
on a Sunday, and why not in the studios? It is chilly out of the sun
in the parks, and now the House is sitting it is difficult to get away
into the coxmtry.
First A. E. Certainly. I suppose you did not see many of the
pictures '<
Second A. E. Well, to tell the truth, I never looked at them.
You see, there is always such a crush, that it's quite a business to
|?et near them. Besides, what is the good? You will be able to
inspect them to your heart's content early in May. What irere
they like?
First A. E. Oh, I don't know. I make it a rule to attend to more
important matters. The pictures can wait.
Second A. E. Quite so. And apropos of the subject, are you
going to the show of the Academicians on Sunday?
First A. E. Of course I shall. Why, I wouldn't miss it for any-
thing. Why half London will be in the Melbury Road and the
Regent's Park. Of course, the paintings will be more interesting
than those exhibited by the outsiders. But I don't think I shall
trouble myself about them. As you say, they can keep until the
Private Views at the New Gallery and the Royal Academy.
Second A. E. Exactly. But really art must be making great
progress in England. Why, a few years ago no one thought of visit-
ing the studios.
First A. E. Yes, we arc distinctly an art-loving people. But you
haven't told rhe—shall you come to the Show on Sunday?
Second A. E. That is a question I cannot answer until I have
heard from my dressmaker. If I can get my main' gown in time I
shall certainly turn up. But if it doesn't come I shall mope in the
drawing-room. Won t it he too sad?
First A. E. Too sad. And I am in the same position. My second
Sunday gown is behind time. If it doesn't come, I shall be moping
too. I do so love art.
Second A. E. So do I. Especially now one is not bothered to say
anything complimentary to the artists. So much nicer to move in
and out without having to criticise or to praise. But if we are not
betrayed by our dressmakers, we will go together.
First A. E. Of course we will. And that will be delightful; I do
so dote upon paintings—in a new bonnet.
Second A. E. And I do so love statues—in a new cloak. Ah!
what would we do without the two Sundays?
First A. E. Ah, what indeed! So good for Art generally!
Second A. E. And English artists particularly!
[Scene closes in upon preparations for a great intellectual treat
for the Pillars of Art in England.

LIVELY TIMES IN DRURY LANE.
"DSURIOLANUS" is doing well, very well, with his "Operas in
English." The National Theatre has been crowded on the nights it
has been opened for the reception of the Public and the Public's
favourites. Maritana, Faust, Carmen, and The Bohemian Girl,
have been played in turn and with
equally satisfactory results. At the
initial performance of BAI.FE'S master-
piece it was (musically) noted that
Yon 'II Hemember Me" was not
encored. Quite so, the dear old girl
(she's fifty if she "s a day) could he re-
collected without a reminder. Every
melody is as familiar in our mouths
(with pianoforte accompaniment) as
household words. As the composer (who
was more of an Irishman than a French-
man) might have said of the libretto, "it
is tri-s Bunn." Sir AUGUSTUS seems to
have discovered a Lane without a turn-
, ing. Drama, Pantomime and Opera may
i be seen one after the other, but they keep
to the same straight road—the road to success. So we can sing
'' Turn on Old Times" (adapted from Maritana) without any fear for
the consequences.
JUSTICE TO SHRIMPS. -
A MASS meeting of shrimps took place yesterday in Tide Park, a
nice sandy reach at the mouth of the Thames mid-way between the
Kent and Essex coasts. As it was a Bank Holiday for all
crustaceans, the banks were deserted, and a large attendance was
the result. The state of the water was as
calm as could have been desired, and the
only drawback was a mist supposed to be
due to the Barking outfall.
The Chair-Shrimp said that the object of
that imposing demonstration was known
to all. They had crawled there in their
thousands in order to support the Bill now
before Parliament to check the sale of
French and Belgian shrimps. (Cheers.)
The meeting, of course, was aware that
owing to this unfair foreign competition
^7 the value of true-born British shrimps had
been reduced to half what it once was.
(fries of "Shame."') He protested
against this immigration of destitute alien
shrimps, creatures—he meant—who were
destitute of the praiseworthy and realistic
tlavour which, as all the world acknow-
ledged, belonged tot hemsclvcs. (Applause.)
The foreign shrimp was a fraud. He put it to the meeting —did his
tail come off as easily as their own? (" Ao, Ao.") Had he the same
fine colour? ("Ao/") What he desired was protection to native
industries, and shrimps irere industrious, whatever prawns might
say to the contrary. (Cheert.) The whole effort of their existence
was to taste nice, and keep up their character on the British tea-
table. (General cheering.)
The Next Speaker (irho declined to gire his name for fear of losing
his situation) remarked that what was really wanted was the forma-
tion of a National Union of Amalgamated Crustaceans. Even
prawns and crayfish should be included. ("Ao/" and uproar.) The
foreign shrimp was a blackleg. (Cheers.) Let them drive him back
to Belgium by picketing the eastern coasts, and at the s-ame time
establish a large strike fund! L4pplatite.) To set up such a fund
it was only necessary for them all to shell out. (liiinghli'r.)
Another Shrimp declared that he was a Free Trader. (Hisses.)
Let the foreigners compete with them! Did they think the British
public were such idiots as not to know the difference of taste between
the two? (" Yes" tind" Xo.") If they liked, let the foreigners
have the words " Made in Belgium" inscribed on their backs prior to
sale. (Cheers, and ti mice " Xo room.") He agreed that there was
no room for them in England. (Luiiqhter.) But lot them trust to
the principles of free trade to drive them out! (Cheers, hisses, and
confusion?)
At this point the Resolution was put and declared carried amid
great enthusiasm, and the proceedings terminated with the usual
vote of thanks to the Chair-Shrimp.

"WEARV! so WEARY !"—On Friday last a gentleman wrote to the
Times, signing himself " A Barrister of Twenty Yearn''Standing."
Did he take a chair and sit down to write that letter? If so, has he
ever got up again?

Worn with the long day's ministrations;
In chilly loneness, silence absolute,
Grilling h( r supper o'er the scanty stove.
No brisk companionship, no light, no love;
Nought womanly, save patience and the grace
That arduous culture lends the homeliest

No comfort in that bleak, blank, barn-like

Nothing to warm the heart or charm the taste,
Only Boeotian bareness coarse and crude,
Discomfort drear, and soulless solitude!

"Brutal severity of work, to crush
Her womanhood clean out!" Health's roseate

Frozen to pallor, as her long-stored stock
Of varied learning to her rustic flock
Of dull, precarious pupils is outpoured,
At the dictation of a blundering Board.
Tyrannical Committees overtask her;
High-stomached village autocrats will ask
her
Zeal in return for snubbing; bigots job.
And the mean, pettifogging school-board snob
Makes her dull life a burden and a fear—
She—passing poor on forty pounds a year!

imagine that their salaries are insufficient they will continue to
dispense justice at an inadequate remuneration. This is where, with
deference and, I venture to hope, humility, ERNED COUNSEL comes
in. I am willing to accept a County Court Judgeship, (1) because 1
think £1500 a year an ample stipend, for the services which I should
render; and (2) because I want the post—I may add with truth,
want it badly. Some time ago 1 warned the LORD CHANCELLOR that
unless I were provided for I should take steps to make myself felt,
unpleasantly felt. My hand was temporarily stayed by the fact that
a solicitor induced me to believe that he would brief me in a case in
which my fee would be I(K) guineas, to say nothing of daily refreshers.
Before my brief was delivered, the parties compromised—at least,
the solicitor said they did, though I have my doubts as to whether
the whole thing was not a put-up job.
Now, however, the LORD CHANCELLOR has another chance. As I
have said, I am prepared to sacrifice my prospects at the Bar, and to
suffer the brilliant Junior to be forgotten in the hard-working
County Court Judge. When the present underpaid occupants of
that dignified office resign, I know of no two names which would be
more rapturously hailed by an appreciative public than A. BRIEF-
LESS, Jun., and L. ERNED CODNSEL. There 1 leave the matter, and,
for 1 hope the last time as a stuff-gownsman, subscribe myself,
Yours faithfully, L. EBNED COUNSEL.

Mrs. R. heard some lovely Irish songs lately: they were called,
"Oft in the Chilly Niuht,'1 " The Harp that once through Sara's
Hulls," and " The Minster Soy."
THE NEW "CURSE OF LABOUR."
LABOVR is looked on as the " Primal Curse,"
And that perchance in some respects is true;
Civilisation has devised a worse,
As shown when toilers find " no work to do."
Faith fails, and Charity chills, and Hope lies dead,
When Labour cannot win its " daily bread."
Alas for honest industry, and willing,!
Which welcomes death because it mat/ not work!
Thy torments, idle-handed Toil, are thrilling.
Societv this question may not shirk:
What snail we do with starved, industrious pride,
That, reft of work, seeks rest in—suicide?
NOTE ON THE NEW PIECE AT THE HAYMARKET.—We wonder how
many dramatic authors have thought of placing the old story of
"The Emperor of China's Mantle" on the stage and have been
baffled by the impossibility of representing the Emperor as a " study
from the nude," walking alone, in a procession, until a little
child called out " Why, he's got nothing on!" It was a "new
rfe-parture" on which no English author, experienced or inexperi-
enced, had liked to venture. And now it is produced at the Hay-
market, after being "made in Germany!" We hope that Mr.
ARMBRUSTER, who is responsible for the music to Mr. TREE'S new
piece, has carefully interwoven with his own melodies the theme of
the once popular ditty, "He's got 'em on!"
"RAILWAY RATES BILL."—One clause of this is to insure strict
punctuality, as for certain trains certain rates are to be kept up, and
the time of arrival is to be reduced to a practical certainty. These
trains are to be henceforth known and spoken of as "Certain trains
running on a certain system."

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The Raiders (FISHER UNWIN) is a stirring story of life in Scotland
when GEORGE was King. And a pretty nice life they seem to have
had. The scene is laid in Galloway, land untrodden by WALTER
SCOTT or any of Mr. CROCKETT'S predecessors in this field of fiction.
Mr. STEVENSON writing about The Stickit Minister, an earlier work
by the same author, says of two of the stories contained, "They are
drowned in Scotland." If the weather in Scotland generally is any-
thing like that which prevails through the adventures of Patrick
Heron, hero of this story, the marvel is that anyone should escape
drowning. Through nearly every chapter of The Raiders there is
storm or rain, and whiles it snows. On one occasion, Patrick and his
friend the Gipsy King being snugly ensconced in the cave, "from
•whose very door the precipice, scarred and sheer, fell away both above
and below," it snowed and simultaneously blew a hurricane for six-
teen days! But that was a long time ago, and Scotland, in these davs
beset by tourists, knows how to behave itself better. Perhaps Gal-
loway may be an exception to this ride. But with opportunity of
seeing it in moderately fine weather, there is no need to go to Switzer-
land or the Alps. The natives lived and fought, slaughtered and
were killed, in a country whose sublime picturesqueness glows
through the pages of The Raiders. Mr. CROCKETT'S style is charm-
ing. My Baronite never knew how musical and picturesque is Scot-
tish-English till he read this book; at least, such is the candid
opinion which he gives to the THE BARON BE BOOK-WORMS.

SOCIAL SUBJECT QUESTIONS.

Q. Why should children go home for the holidays to see their

A. Because it is the duty of children to see their parents at least
once a year.

COLONEL QUOTT.M.—Colonel SAUNDERSON at Belfast, Tuesday last,
among other good things, observed that Lord UOSEBERY "appeared
inclined to wear the mantle of the fallen prophet." The simile is, of
course, the Biblical one of the mantle of ELIJAH falling upon the
shoulders of ELISHA, but ELIJAH had gone up and had decidedly
not "fallen." Mr. GLADSTONE has not gone up " to the House of
Peers, but he has certainly "gone up " in the estimation of all parties
by retiring. However, probably Colonel SAUNDEHSON'S knowledge
of his audience is better than his acquaintance with Scripture.

DISCOVERIES IN SKY.—Sir HENRY THOMP-
SON, the eminent surgeon, has offered the
magnificent sum of £5000 to the nation for
the purchase of a new telescope for Green-
wich Observatory. Not satisfied with being
an undeniable authority on gastronomy, Sir
HENRY is now about to earn the thanks of
several Heavenly Bodies for bringing them
in closer communication with our earth.
Perhaps, by some surgical operation, he could
get one of the "Heavenly Twins" to visit us,
and bring us a specimen of ethereal drink in
a bottle of "mflky whey," and, in another
bottle, the spirit known as "Three Stars."
Sir HENRY might start a Company of " Astral
Bodies," Limited.
"A STORY OF HIDDEN TREASURE." (See
Times of March 29.)—There will already have
been a rush for this idea, and the first to
grasp it and bring out a romance will win,
unless it should turn out that Mr. ROBERT
Loos STEVENSON is the "correspondent"
who sent the strange tale to the Times, in
which case the novel will be announced in a
few days by the author of Treasure Island,
which is sure to be "treasure trove" for the
readers thereof.

GLADSTONIAN REGIMEN.—Mr. G.'s diet is

THE WHOLE ART OF FICTION.
[" Plots for Novels for sale."]
! NOVELISTS weary of commonplace platitude,
Seeking developments striking and new,
Listen, and learn with appropriate gratitude
What a resource is here opened for you!
Writers of stories, designers of serials,
Up to the present you 've painfully made
Quite a superfluous search for materials,
Here is a system your labours to aid.
Whether you write in a style allegorical.
Whether the comic you cultivate most,
Tales of adventure, romances historical,—
Plots for them all will be sent you by post!
And when the trade has attained to dimen-
sions that
Few at the present would dare to conceive,
Surely the scheme will admit of extensions
that
Further your arduous work will relieve.
For if the plot, in the manner suggested in
Offers like this vou are willing to buy,
Characters too will be largely invested in,
Dialogue somebody else will simply.
Thus, by adapting the work of your neigh-
bour, you
Quickly the taste of the public will please;
Thus, by this splendid division of labour, you
Surely will write with ridiculous ease;
Thus without any commanding ability
Soon you'll secure the renown which you
seek,
And by this scheme of enormous utility
End by producing a novel a week!

TO ANGELINA, DAMOSEL ERRANT.
["Fie fro the pres."—Good Cotmteilof Chavcei:}
MY twinkling meteoric love,
I 've often wondered where you are,
Since, like the dear diluvian dove,
You flitted on your Wanderjahr.
Compelled to take another fair
To be the butt of my effusions,
I trusted to the printer's care
My tropes ana delicate allusions.
For you, I said, would know my hand
Under " Tip-topics of the Week ";
Old memories would waken and
A sorry rheum bedew your cheek;
And jealousy would in you burn
And freely melt your snowy breast,
And ultimately you 'd return
To seek forgiveness on my chest.
Meanwhile I raked the haunts of men,
The club, the common bar, the course;
I dogged the gambler to his den,
And questioned members of the Force;
I thought to trace your form disguised
As Patte en Fair or Columbine,
And frankly own I am surprised
To find you in the printing line!
I never guessed you loved the art,
Although, of course, I often hinted
That on the tablets of your heart
My faithful name should be imprinted.
But when my verses, more or less
Adapted to the concertina,
Got rudely mangled in the press,
I spotted you, my ANGELINA.
I recognised a woman's spite,
That rankles like a common splinter,
And knew it was my heart's delight
Had played the devil of a printer.
The proofs were there; they could be seen;
It drove me nigh to pessimism,
This fruit of lawless rites between
A Malaprop and Spoonerism!
The " load of all my bitter past"
Was grossly changed to "lard" and
"butter";
I "sought a shelter from the blast,"
The proof declared I " bought a shutter."
The "spoils of time" were turned to
"spills,"
'' Union and peace" to " peas and onions,''
The " lover's ifls'; to " liver pills"
And "Cupid's pinions" to his "bunions."
0 ANGELINA, turn again
And print a kiss on lips of mine!
Come back, and wed your amorous swain!
(Please do not read it "humorous swine.")
Oh, listen to the Laureate's pipe!
With Nature let your feud abate;
And be more careful of the type,
More careless of the single state!
A CHANCE.—"A gentleman going abroad"
advertised in the Times the other day that he
wanted "to realise 167 dozen of wine at
once." When "wine is in," as we all know,
"wit is out" ; but as the wine evidently is
not "in," surely the gentleman must be
strangely lacking in the imaginative faculty
nottobeabletositdown and "realise" to him-
self the notion of " 167 dozen of wine." Sit in
your chair, think of it, shut your eyes, see
the 167 dozen in your mind's eye, HORATIO,
and the thing is done. But we can't realise
enough to buy the 167 dozen; which is quite
another story.

I WROTE you a sonnet last night,
It seemed such a brilliant idea,
And when I had finished it quite

Then I read it three times to find out
What manner of sonnet it was,
And the third reading banished my dtubt,
For I tore it across and across.
For somehow I hoped to compress
The torture and tumult and bliss,
And the general conflict and stress,
And the rapture we only just miss
Into fourteen rhymed lines, that should fioat
All down the broad river of Time—
A sonnet the Last Man might quote,
A cameo, small but sublime!
Of vintage I counted thv thought
The rarest, and bound to endure,
And rhymes were the cork that I sought
For keeping the bottle secure!
But though 1 had corked the thing fast
With infinite labour and pride,

TO BE OR NOT TO BE—EASTER.
DEAR MR. PUNCH.—You are so good to us
fellows that I am quite sure you won't mind
putting in a suggestion on our behalf. I see
that some people calling themselves "Pater-
familias," "A Parent," "The Father of a
Public Schoolboy," and the like, have been
writing to the papers suggesting that the
Easter Holidays are very "inconvenient."
They complain that the uncertainty about
the dates of the vacation causes no end of
trouble. One of these persons last week said
that he had a master son who came home in
the middle of March, a scholar son who
turned up in the second week of April, and
a boarding-school daughter who did not have
her vacation until the month of May. He
declared, that in consequence of this arrange-
ment his eldest son and that eldest son's
sister never met. Of course, this was a cause
of great regret to 1he parent, who, however,
seemed more cut up at the fact that the mix-
ture of dates seriously interfered with his own
convenience. Now, with a view to pleat-ing
everyone, I have a suggestion to make. If
the times are all different, whv not get them
uniform by fixing the Easter Holidays to be-
gin in the middle of March and to end in the
middle of May? By this arrangement brothers
and sisters \yill be able to be at home all to-
gether. This will please the masters and the
boys equally, and if Paterfamilias objects,
why let him refer the matter to Mater-
familias who is more of a brick than he is.
Thanking you in advance for inserting this
letter and possibly for sending me next term

ELECTION INTELLIGENCE.
Leith Boroughs.—Despite the fact that
Tory Party fought with one of the Blue Bells
of Scotland, a handsome victory for the pro-
mising young Whip, MUXRO-FERGUSON.
Hatctck.—Liberal motto here—" SHAW to
win." True, no doubt, that " every dog has
his day," but election-day here evidently
not FCLLAHTON'S.
Montgomeryshire.— Result here a paradox.
OWEN, the M.P., a Liberal; but the Tories,
having dropped their MYTTON, secure a
WYNN.
Berwickshire.—This delightful country
seat let to a highly eligible young TENNANT.
C. B. BALFOUR, however, says, not a life-
Tennant.
Wisbech.—Liberals satisfied their candi-
date is of the right BRAND. STOPFORD SACK-
VILLE finds it difficult to compete with songs
of the singing Mrs. BRAND.
Ramford.—Liberals irreverently called the

"LORD JACK AND MY
LADY JILL.".
(Tht Latest Jhniiance of the
Peerage.)
FORTUNE had been very
good to JACK BROWN-JONES.
He had succeeded beyond his
wildest dreams of ambition.
He had successfully contested
an election, and had been re-
turned to the House of Com-
mons by a small but sufficient
majority of half-a-dozen votes.
At Westminster he had done
wonders. Joining the extreme
Radicals, he had asked so
many awkward questions that
he had been put down for a ]
special place in the list of the
coming Government. He had
but one regret, and it was not
a very deep one. Although
bitterly opposed to the House
of Peers, he was distantly—
very distantly—related to a
member of that august but
useless Assembly. He was
ninth cousin, twice removed,
to a Baron of the Realm.
Well, what of that:1 When
the time came, in spite of the
blood relationship existing
between himself and one of
the hereditary legislators, he
would vote the abolition of the
Upper Chamber, not only
without compunction, but with
absolute pleasure. Seeing so
bright a prospect before him,
JACK had engaged himself to
a young lady of advanced
views. JILL was as beautiful
as she was free, and as good
as she was unconventional.
She was careful not to inter-
fere with the career of her
fiance. In fact, she ht I not the time, for she had a career of her
own. She believed in latch-keys, and unattended visits to music-
halls. She sympathised with the nursing movement, and wished to
join the Amazon detachment of the Ambulance Corps. She knew
her platoon exercise as well as her bandage drill, and was quite as
successful in making a bull's-eye as binding up a man's feg. So
although she never disturbed JACK unnecessarily, she did not con-
sider it contrary to maidenly modesty to look him up when she
pleased.

same name on the same address
cards that we are a drag upon
one another."
"I don't think we shall,"
returned JILL, earnestly;
i " and if we do, we can get a
deed of separation. You see,
my dear bov, I am nothing if
not practical."
"And so am I, my good old
lass," put in JACK; "and it
would be awful rot were we to
take a step that would cause
mutual inconvenience."
"Rot!" echoed JILL; "it
would be blessed rot."
JILL did not say " blessed,"
but "blessed " is a word that
will do as well as (and perhaps
belter than) any other.
"But," continued the fair
female with animation, "I
don't see how it can hurt
either of us. You are in the
House of Commons. You
have the ball at your feet.
All you have to do is to stretch
forth your leg and kick it.
Hut here, I am hanged if I did
. not forget to give you this
letter."
And, again, JILL did not,use
the word "hanged," but
"hanged" is once more an
expression that will do us well
as (and perhaps better than)
any other. The young man
opened the letter carelessly,
and, having read it, turned as
white as a turnip, and possibly
whiter.
"What's up, old chap!"'
asked JILL, putting down her
cigarette lor a moment, and
fixing her fiance with her
pince-nez.
"I am a ruined man,"
gasped out JACK. "My noble
relative and all his immediate descendants are dead, and I have suc-
ceeded to the peerage!"
"A gone coon," was the reply, followed by a lengthy and melan-
choly whistle. '' Then you are no longer BKOWN-JONES?"
"No, alas! I am now the Baron ROBINSON."
"We must defer further discussion until a more fitting oppor-
tunity," commented JILL, and once more puffing at her cigarette,
she nodded to her ex-fianci' and left him.
"Confound my coronet!" muttered the young man, when alone.

"Have a brandy and soda, JiLL'r" said JACK, as he continued \ And the same idea was conveyed in stronger language (but "eon-

intended to shake the House of Lords to its very foundation. "Help
yourself, like a good girl, as I have a lot of letters to write before
post time."
"All right, old man," answered the lovely female. "I will rob
you of some spirits and fizzing-water. You don't mind smoking, do
you?" and without pausing for a replv, JILL lighted a cigarette.
JACK stolidly continued his labours, and after a silence of a quarter
of an hour turned round in his chair, and faced his visitor.
"And now, my dear old girl, what do you want'' If it's money,
say so at once, for 1 have plenty of it; and I need scarcely tell you
that my cheque-book (plim signatures) is entirely at your disjwsal."
"You arc really a trump, old man," returned the fair girl with
glittering eyes; "but I am hanged if I want anything of the kind."
JILL did not say "hanged," but that is a word that will do as well
as (and perhaps better than) any other.
"Then what's it all about ?>r
"You asked me some years ago to become your wife. Well, at
that moment I was more accustomed to the nurserv than behind the
scenes at the Frivolity, and did not know my mind. I wanted to see
life. Since then I have seen it, and consider life a dashed bad busi-
ness."
The lovely lady did not say "dashed," but "dashed" is a word
that will do as well as (and perhaps better than) any other.
"And so you want to withdraw your refusal 'f" queried JACK.
"But, my dear lass, business is business, and I can't give you a
reply in a hurry. The happiness of my life—besides yours—depends
upon my decision. We may find after we have agreed to share the

From the S-cr-t-ry for W-r to the F-rst L-rd nf the Adm-r-lty.

Above is self-explanatory. Think we can spare a Militia Regi-

We can't do more. Send paper on to anyone you please.
From the F-rst L-rd of the Adm-r-lty to the L-rd Ch-nc-llor.

Above is self-explanatory. "We can easily spare a ship to send

Above is self-explanatory. Don't think there is much in the point

had better return it to the Premier.
From the Ch-f C-mm-ss-n-r of P-l-ce to the Pr-m-r,
Scotland Yard.
Have the honour to return this paper, as directed. Do not con-
sider that either Militia Regiment, Troop-ship, or Legal ophrion, is
necessary. Probably the treasure by this time has been discovered
and appropriated. Under these circumstances can only express a
respectful wish that the Government may quickly recover it.
"A FEARFUL TRADE."

this sale. What a dreadful finish for these aged servitors! Please
do your best to prevent this sad traffic and receive the thanks of

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE VERDERER'S VISION;
OR, THE EPPIXG HAMADRYAD'S APPEAL.
"Hast thou not dragged Diana from her car,
And driven the Hamadryad from the wood?"
E. A. POE.
The Vigilant Verderer hearetk in Vision a Voice
from an Epping " Talking Oak."
f PAKE, Woodman, spare my tree! Good
Civic Verderer,
Let Nature and her Nymphs move thee to
pity!
Pan's rule swift narrows; wouldst thou play
the murderer
To the poor Muses' train? Thou hast the
City,
The formal urban park, the prim town-garden,
To play the pedant with, with square and
angle;
Leave London its last patch of genuine Arden,
The winding wood-walk and the untrimmed
tangle.
Lovers of lavish leaf ery and branch-mazes,
Of bosky brushwood and tumultuous
bracken,
Echo my plea, and wait to pour forth praises
On him who bids the axe and saw to slacken
In their too sweeping work. Sweet Nature's
fashion
Of opulent overgrowth and rich disorder,
May need some check, but the Boeotian
passion
For rectilinear road and rigid border,
The butcher-love of felling, topping, lopping,
Trunk pollarding, and blundering branch-
maiming;
The clumsy gardener-rage for random chop-
ping,
The cockney taste for trimming and for
training,—
These, Verderer, need the Nature-lover's
checking.
The winning charm of wildness is a rapture
Art cannot give. The jocund wild birds,
pecking
And jargoning at large are spoilt by
capture;
The clipped hedge chills, the straight drawn
alley sickens;
The sapling lopped, the tall tree mutilated,
Enrage and sadden every heart that quickens
At Pan's spontaneous pipings. Am I fated,
I and my true, tree-loving, Ariel-footed,
Free company of Wood-nymphs, to be
banished
Each from the tree wherewith since first it
rooted
Our being blent? Nay Verderer! Pan
hath vanished
And neither charms nor frights the holiday
comers,
Who dance not as the fauns did; but the
sweetness,
The glad home-feeling, born of countless
summers
And long, wild, windy winters; the com-
pleteness
Of the green earth's inimitable glory,
Soul-restful raptness, and rich, low-voiced
quiet;
fhe pregnant peace of forest king-crowds
hoary,
Which even satyr mirth and cockney riot
Cannot destroy,—these woodlands still are
haunted
By those glad graces! Let these glades
unbroken
Still keep some semblancs of the woods en-
oh anted
Of Arden and Broceliande!
Be it spoken,
The word that checks the axe-fall. Wood-
man spare us!
My oak perchance is old, grer-boll'd, age-
eaten,

AFTER THE THEATRICALS.
"WHAT ON EARTH MADE YOU TELL THAT APPALLING LITTLE CAD THAT HE OUGHT TO
HAVE TROD THE BOARDS OF ANCIENT GREECE? You SURELY DIDN'T REALLY ADMIRE HIS
ACTING?"
OH NO! BUT, YOU KNOW, THE GREEK ACTORS USED TO WEAR MASKS!'
But it yet spreads brave greenery. Do not
tear us
Untimely from dear earth. Sun-wanned,
gale-beaten
Long centuries through, he yet can breast
the thunder,
And drink the shower this many and many
a season;
Shelter sport-heated holiday groups there-
under.
And harbour warbling bird-choirs! 'Twere
sheer treason
To noble woodcraft, as to woodland lovers,
To fell or maim this monarch prematurely.
Nay; while the dove o'er its spread branches
hovers,
Let the tree stand; let Faunus pipe securely
At quiet morn in its cool shade, sly hidden
In uncleared undergrowth of tangled
greenery;
Let axe and saw and billhook be forbidden
To turn these bosky breadths of forest
scenery
To a trim-planted, straight-walk'd park.
Oh, listen [sad burden'
To the fond Wood-nymph's plaint and its
And gladness in a thousand eyes shall glisten,

IN ROTTEN ROW.
(To Althea, from " Wandering Willie.")
WHEN the Row is in its pride,
When the riders come and go,
Though I can't afford to ride,
Is it not a pretty show?
With a glint of golden hair
Goes a rider fleet and fair.
We have never spoken yet,
Often as you 've ridden by,
Only once your eves I met,
And vou bowed and so did I.
Still—I wonder if you know
Why I walk in Rotten Row!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TO PHYLLIS.
In Fashionable Attire,
I LIKE your bow—or is it called a tie 'i
That's just the kind of thing I never know.
Perhaps it is because I never try—
I like your bow.
Somehow I fancy that it seems to go
Extremely well with what you 're wearing. I
Delight in harmonies of colour—though
These reasons up to now are all my eye.
The only true one I 've still space to show.
You wear it, Sweetheart. That's the reason why
I like your bow.

AT THE GOUPIL GALLERY.
BEING a bit of an impressionable myself, and understanding that
Goupil Gallery contains best one-horse show of its kind, went to
take a stereoscopic view of same. Find that I am misled about
one-horse business; actually quite a herd of steers. Always re-
garded impressionist as one who (fivesivou his impression of a thing,
and leaves you to form yours of his. Here, however, is artist giving
his impressions of a lot of other impressionists' impressions of things,
and leaving you to form yours of his or theirs. Sort of iridescent
palimpsest.
Natural, perhaps, in one who has plainly travelled a good deal—to
the Isle of Wight, for instance, and
even Boulogne-sur-Mer. Notice no
fewer than six out of a total of forty-
four pictures admittedly inspired by
this classic watering-place. You
will begin with No. 1. It is the
Casino at Boulogne, and the catalogue
says it is the property of T. HUM-
PHREY WARD, Esq. In that case let
me tell this gentleman that I very
strongly disapprove of the system of
Petits Cheraux as practised on his
property. Have calculated the
chances, and find that bank makes
9'1 per cent, on all moneys laid on
table. Should have complained to
Mr. WARD before, but was under
impression that Casino was worked
by local Municipality*; otherwise
could not account for public gambling-table being allowed in country
where it is illegal. No. 23 shows the Hotel Imperiale at the same resort.
Observe that all the windows have been plastered up since I was there.
Pathetic touch in foreground—black man bathing. No ocean, nor
all the House of Pears will ever rectify this Ethiopian's skin! Do
not easily weep, but was honestly affected at this thought.
'' Boulogne—ereninq" (No. 25) has also human appeal in it. So have I
seen this harbour, biliously patchy, impossibly crooked, after an ex-
purgative passage from Folkestone. Boulogne Sands" (No. 32),
are, I see, the property of Professor BROWN. But professor of whati'
For professors are many, but performers few; chieflv on the tight-
rope are they found together. And for that any sand is bad, but this
sort of sand very bad. Again I ask myself if Mr. BROWN'S property in-
cludes the figures. If so, his responsibility is indeed great, and I
offer him my respectful sympathy. If he will accept my advice as
well, he will hang the picture the other way up. Sand, sea, and sky
are all pretty indifferently ribbed, and I think the figures would be
perceptibly improved by the change. The gentleman that owns
the pier (No. 43) might perhaps have the structure raised a little.
At present it dips into the sea at one corner. Have thought
this may represent the levelling process of which the Radicals speak.
Also there are figures on the pier that would improve the picture if
they were removed. Am not a draughtsman myself, but should cer-
tainly draw the line somewhere short of the length of these young
people's femora. No. 3H is the pier—no, peer—of the other. Girls
running (the catalogue says they are "girls," and "running") are
shown in strong sunlight.' A vivid thing, and true to Nature in at
least one particular. Could never bear to look at strong sunlight;
could not bear to look at this picture.
Still on foreign tour, we approach Isle of Wight in No. 2. Here
we have Steer at sea (ritulut marinus). Naturally enough, off
Cowes, with bulls'-eyes distributed along shore. No. 15 gives an
Iceberg race run in strong pea-soup, and watched by NANSBN,
FRANKLIN, and others, as seen in foreground insecurely balanced on
—is it a whale, or only backed like a weasel? Observe that it is the
property of Miss JANE HARRISON. Have great respect for this lady
as authority on Greek Art. This Art also Greek to me.
Walk up to charming girl seated on sofa; curious to know more
about her. Look in catalogue and find that she is " Croquet." Am
prepared for a good deal, but have doubts this time of the purity of
my vision. Closer investigation shows part of ticket to be concealed
behind frame. Actual title of picture (No. 34, not 4) proves to be
"The Sofa," lurid light thrown on subject by this revelation
practically clearing up lady's past history. Turn to the real No. 4
(" Croquet"). Find more children, as happy and careless as the
artist, sporting ankle-deep beside sea. Have heard of Olympian
races run in deep sand, but never remember croquet played under
these conditions. "Bathing-machines" (No. 13) recalls Mr.
Punch's prehistoric peep—"No Bathing to-day." This time it is
the shore that is covered with horrid creeping things. "In a
Wood" (No. 40) gives similar effects. Lady, properly terrified,
kneels deprecatingly to vast army of green beetles, begging them
not to
Much attracted to delightful young person in No. 3. Reminds me
of subject of my unpublished Irish ballad:—
My MOLLY she'd the natest waist,
And ('hakes like cherries at a faist,
So soft to touch, so swate to taste, &c.
Pleased to find title of same beginning " Molle meurn." So far so
good; but continues darkly as follows:—
levibus cor cst violabile telis,
Et semper causa eat our ego semper amcm.
Inspect picture carefully to dettct bullet-marks. Find some half-
dozen on background; really excellent shots but a little wide to the
right. Interested to recognise same lady in No. 44. Besieging
party in this case much more succesiul. Figure completely
covered with pellets. Caught napping, which may account for it.
Note also, that she has changed hands and become the property of
another gentleman. Seems consistent with description of her eclectic
temperament.
Am finally petrified before No. 42. Commonly amuse myself at im-
pressionist collections by guessing subject of picture before referring to
catalogue. Remember one at Grafton Gallery last year which I took
to be me green-room of the Folies Bergeres, and found that artist
thought it was Sunday morning in Sweden. Proceed to speculate on
abvsmally despondent girl in No. 42. Has she also just crossed from
Folkestone? Is it the liver (absinthe, perhaps) or "is there a nearer
one yet and a dearer," that has played her false? Cannot endure
further suspense, and so look in catalogue. Answer—"Girl in a
large hat." Wonder that I had not thought of that before. See
that she is the property of GEORGE MOORE, Esq., who has taken us
into his confidence in the Speaker, and says that she has been his
for now several months, and that he grows fonder of her every day.
Thank Heaven, I have a soul above envy, and I sign myself,
ONE MORE (OR LKSS) IMPRESSIONABLE.
PEERS, IDLE PEERS!
Or, The. Wail oflhc Eldest Sons.
[Mr. GEORGE CUKZON, Mr. ST. JOHN BUODRICK, and Lord WOI.SIER
(in the Nineteenth Crntnry), lament the doom of eldest sons of Peers,
prospective banishment from the Commons and burial in the Lords.]
PEERS, idle Peers! I well know what that means.
Peers! Oh, it fills me with divine despair,
Hearing the " Noes," and listening to the " Ayes,"
$P>ii And looking on those happy Commons seats,
And thinking I may soon sit there no more.
Fresh is the first, cheer, rising like " All hail!"
When one is brought into the Lower House.
Sad is the last which murmurs over one,
Who sinks, with all the chance of fun, upstairs!
So sad 'twill be when we sit here no more!
Ah, sad and strange, amidst the robes and lawns,
The peevish pipe of half-awakened Peers
On age-dulled ears, and dim and drowsy eyes
'Midst owlish moans and glimmering despair!
How dull our doom when we sit here no more!
Dear as remembered " sprints " when scant o' breath
Will be those cheers, by hopeless fancy feigned
From lips that shout for others. Kicked upstairs?
Ah, there, above, we '11 mourn with wild regret,
Midst Death in Life, the days that are no more!

THE UNION JACK OVER THE HOUSE OF LORDS.
THE Flag that flies in any
fray
Will last to fly another day;
But flags, like men of stoutish
kind.
Must fail to fly for laek of wind.

KNOW ye the land where the tax-papers
hurtle,
And rates will run up, e'en though incomes
run down?
Where the people of culture, the lovers of
turtle,
Don't pay their full whack, whilst the poor
are done brown.
Know ye the land of distraint, fee and fine?
Where the taxes still swell, and the rates
ne'er decline;
Where the little shop slave in his little back
room,
Waxes faint as his lilac trees burst into bloom;
Since in spring Schedule D is in angry
pursuit,
And the voice of the Tax-grabber never is
mute;
Where the tint of the summons resembles the

breeze P
The old word of command from the Treasury

'Tisn't music to millionaires dwelling at ease,
But to the hard-uppish 'tis horror; hearts

And they shorten your grace, and it comes in
one lump.
And they tighten the screw, harder pull at
the pump,
Till it makes your brain whirl, and it makes
your heart thump,
And gives you what cads call " the bloomin'
old hump!"
Every year makes it worse; they are stuck-
up and starch;
What in August you paid, you must now pay
in March,
For the gold-stream must flow as it suits them
to pump it,
And if you don't like it, of course you can
"lump it."
Ah! pity the worries—though nobody will.'—
Of the poor little victim of Tax, Kate, and Bill!
If quidnuncs indulge in a big naval scare,
Or a summer too hot bids rum-vendors despair;
The income-tax payer, though nigh " stony-
broke,"
Must expect a fresh " squeeze" as the crown
of the joke!
Squeeze! SQUEEZE!! SQUEEZE!!!
You mav shrink as you please,
You poor little, often-drained, much-wilted
lemon;
Your sighs will not soften the Treasury Demon.
For squeezing and squashing, you see, is his
trade,
And he cannot conduct it without Lemon-aid.'
And be sure he won't slacken the leveror screw,
While he thinks he can drain a drop more out
of you.'
MSOP UP TO DATE.
A CERTAIN man and a lion, who considered
himself just domestic enough but not too
domestic, were journeying together and dis-
puting, as is the wont of fellow-travellers.
"At any rate, we agree thus far," said the
man, "that fitness for ladies' society must
accompany every claim to domesticity."
The lion was graciously pleased to assent.
"Then just you listen to this," continued
the man, producing a pocket-volume of SHAKS-
PEABE and reading in a triumphant tone:—"A
lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing!"
The chivalrous beast was taken aback some-
what.
"And this," he sighed, "despite your
former belief and admission that we have ever
been in the habit of treating young ladies, who
deserve it, with peculiar respect! However,
this is only your statement of your case after
all. Pray let me have your patient attention
for one moment now. You nave, of course,
read or heard about a certain affair at West-
minster, where, in addition to a heavy whip,
an iron-spiked pole, 'not to put too fine a
point on it,' is at least en evidence. Well, so
have we. You have only to wait until we lions
turn authors, and you will discover that we
hold just the contrary opinion to yours. I
doubt not that our greatest poet, when he
arrives, will put it that ' a lady among lions
is a most dreadful thing.'"

His Lordship. Now, gentlemen, I must
beg you to act with expedition, as I have an
immense list to get through.
First Counsel. May it please your Lord-
ship, but there is an important case that
should have been tried in another Court, but
owing to the absence of his Lordship on busi-
ness elsewhere, it cannot be reached. Would
your Lordship have any objection to its being
added to your own list?
His Lordship. Very sorry, but utterly im-
possible. I have already told you that 1 have
more to do than I can manage. I would be

utterly impossible.
Leader of the Bar. If I might venture to
intervene, my Lord, I would suggest that Mr.
Justice is sitting to-day at the Guild-
hall, and from what I am told, is likely, I
believe, to get through his list rather rapi'dly.
His Lordship. I am much obliged to you.

OUGHT JUDGES TO SLEEP
IN COURT.
DEAB SIB,—You will re-
member that some short time
since I promised at an early
opportunity to recur (of course
with your kind permission) to
the question with which I have
headed this letter. I wish at
once to say that the effect of
my previous reference to the
subject has been extraordi-
nary, to put it at the lowest.
One learned Judge, not un-
known for his fondness for
tempering justice (to others)
with forty winks (for himself),
took occasion, in a case in
which at a moment's notice I
held a brief for a friend, to
say that I had conducted it
with "the ability and know-
ledge which we always expect
and get from Mr. COUNSEL."
It was the first time I had ever
practised before him in my
life. Another Judge, whose
reputation for slumber never
sleeps, asked my wife and my-
self to dinner on the ground
that he fancied my father and
he were College contempo-
raries. My father, as a fact,
never went to College, but that
did not prevent me going to
the dinner. A third Judge
even went so far as to give me
a judgment in a case in which
I was clearly out of Court.
As I had pledged my reputa-
tion to this effect to my client,
who had steadily taken an
opposite view, the Judge's
attention to me was a cruel
kindness.
Such have been the attempts

FROM THE SISTER ISLE.
"ARK YOB A PROTESTANT? I NLVER HIRE A CAR UNLESS IT'S DRIVEN
BY A PROTESTANT."
"WELL, MA'AM, I 'M NOT A PROTESTANT MESELF—BUT SURE ME HORSE
is!" "You 'RE A VERY IMPERTINENT PEBSON I"
"WELL, MA'AM, I'M SURE or IT; FOR I'VE BEEN DHRIVIN' HIM Two
YEARS, AND HE'S NEVER BEEN DOWN ON HIS KNEES YET!"
LAST SUMMER'S STRAW

They don't concern me.
Where is that old straw
hat of ninely-three.
Cool to my fevered brow

Hot as can be?
April has come, not April

Showers, cold winds, slight
snow we do not fear;
Summer-like sun brings me-
mories of grilling
Daya of last year.
Where is my old straw hat?

Tempts one from toppers.
Buds are on Ihe limes.

FRENCH ORIGINALS AND
ENGLISH ADAPTATION.—In no
instance is this more apparent
than in a certain 'Arry-like
which have been made to stave off the evil day, but I am nothing if vulgarism, which is, says our own etymological jrofessor, simply a
not incorruptible. The compliment, the dinner, and the judgment perversion of " Elle et lui." _" Lui" is individualised as " Tommy,"
were all equally extremely pleasant, and I am loth to repav kindness and an aspirate has been prefixed to "elle." The other evening this

the bench for longer than, say, half an hour at a time. I assume that ________________
there must be sleep, because my observation leads me to see that to
look for any other condition of affairs is hopeless.
There are wideawake Judges, of course; just as there are white
blackbirds. The general position is, however, clear. The right of
a Judge to fleep on the Bench is regarded as an inalienable privilege,
to take advantage of which is not only natural but meritorious. If
you go into Court—especially in the afternoon—it's pretty well an
even chance that you will find his Lordship—well, not awake.
I notice that a discussion has lately taken place as to the best
method of waking Judges under these circumstances. The best
method would appear to be a violent forensic fight between counsel
—a "put up job," designed to arouse the Court. I know another
good—to stop the case absolutely. I well remember the

What is certain is, that THE MACGBEGOB to-day presented himself in
the ordinary modest dress with which he used to lend an air of
respectability to Penrith, what time he was Medical Officer and
Public Vaccinator for the district. This again may be a ruse
designed to throw the SQUIRE off his guard, and circumvent the
police. Whilst appearances are satisfactory it would not be wise to
forget that THE MACGBEGOB'S words remain on recoid unrecalled.
The House of Commons and a reckless Ministry have been told that in
continuance of certain circumstances he (THE MACGREGOB) will not
be responsible for peace in the Highlands.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A sense of something darkly impending from the back bench
vhere THE MACGREKOR Rits, looking wiser than mortal man ever was,
cast a gloom over what should have been genial debate. TREVKI.YAN
moved resolution remitting Scotch business to Grand Committee of
Scotch Members, with fifteen hapless foreigners thrown in with
>rospect of a session's serious enjoyment. With all the skill of a
naster of literary art TREVELYAN drew picture of halcyon times in
Jrand Committee room. Orators Scotch: audience Scotch; seventy-
wo Scotchmen all told, with fifteen feeble Southrons ill with haggis.
So passage in the most delightful of modern biographies more
inisned or more effective.
"Mon!" said DO.VALD MICPAHLANE, furtively wiping away a
tear with dexterous fling of the last half yard of his beard, "it's
delcm m*. It prjmises the fullest p>ssible realisation of Paradise
Regained."
The effect, though swift and marked, was but momentary.
PHINCE ARTHUR, sti red to the depths, tKshed forth a brilliant
replv. Then Scotch M -mbers took the floor, and the rest went forth
on the Terrace or in I ho Tea-room to think over -what they might
possibly be going to say.
Butuiest done,—TIIEVELYAN sketches a Parliamentary Elysium.
Tuesday. — Ai.iiF.RT HOLLIT is the gentleman whom a Conserva-
tive, angerul at fome evidence of inde-
pendence, hit off in a phrase that hugely
delighted the party. "The proposal,"
he said, alluding to a motion before the
House.-, " receives the support of gentle-
men sitting on this side of the House;
it is approved by gentlemen who sit on
the other side; and it is accepted by
the Member for South Islington, who
endeavours to sit on both sides of the
House."
That, meant as a sneer, was really
tribute to judicial mind, and freedom
from party servility. ROLLIT delivered
admirable speech to-night in support of
Motion for Select Committee to inquire
whether anything can be done to im-
prove procedure of House. DILKE,
another model of the judicial mind,
supported him. GHANDOLPH, strangely
angered at suggestion, replied with great
vigour to speeches which ROLLIT and
DILKE from time to time insisted they
had not made. GRANDOLPH knew better,
and pounded away. Whilst objecting to
taking this particular step towards alter-
ing Parliamentary procedure, he intro-
duced an innovation of his own. Instead
of referring to mover of Motion as " the
Hon. Member for South Islington," he
lightly alluded to him as "ROLLIT."
House almost convulsed with horror. You may, within certain
bounds, say almost anything about a man in the Commons, but you
must not mention his name.
Some time before House got over the shock. The consequent
paralysis, though temjKirary, had probably something to do with
what followed. The SQUIRK intended to take part in debate and
state views and intentions of Government. When SPEAKER went

remarkable was the effect of the CAP'EX'S eloquence, that when he
sat down it was felt there was nothing more to be said. The SPEAKEI

trooped in amazed to find debate that had promised to go on til
midnight, concluded. With them, torn away abruptly from his
hasty meal, came the SQUIRE, "his mouth full of cabbage and con-
tradiction," as the CAP'EX profanely whispered in the ear of th<
abashed BARTLEY. Nothing to be done but to vote. Members

CAN'T BE BETTEE THAN BEST.
MR. J. L. TOOLE is, as he always is, very
droll, cela ra sans dire, and seeing that a certain
Mr. Price Putlfatp, Chairman of the Great
Southern Railway, appears as Mr. TOOLE in Mr.
RALPH LUMLEY'S comic play of The Best Man,
it is only good logic to say that Mr. Price Putt-
low aforesaid is as droll as Mr. J. L. TOOLE.
The plot is not ill-contrived, though the author
has scarcely used his own materials to the best
possible advantage. As to the dialogue, it is
decidedly not brilliant. One or two little bits,
which are calculated to make the judicious
grieve, ought to be operated upon by the excise
officer at once. If I remember rightly they
occur in the part of Mr. Minch, which is capi-
tally played by Mr. GEORGE SFIELTON. Granted
Mr. TOOLE as the Best Man then is Miss
BEATRICE LAMB the Best Woman ia a part
which certainly suggests Mrs. JOHN WOOD'S
peculiarities at every turn of it; but Miss LAMB
is quite equal to the occasion. Miss ELIZA
JOHNSTONE squeezes the regulation "chamber-
maid" and gets out of it all that was put into it.
Miss ALICE KINGSLEY and Miss FOBDYCE do all
that can be done with two girls not strongly
individualised, and Miss CORA POOLE makes a
decided hit as a young lady who, through a
considerable portion of the play, has lost her
voice. Her pantomime might have been stronger,
and the scenes in which this new edition of the
"Dumb Belle" appears might have been comic-
ally developed with benefit to the piece. Mr.
BILLINGTON in Brown Boots,—Brown-booted
BILLINGTON,—is a fine specimen of the theatri-
cal middle-aged, jovial, fiery, country-loving
Baronet, a variation of the genus "peppery
Colonel" character of old farce and venerable
comedy. Mr. LOWNB is a gentlemanly and un-
obtrusive portrait-painter, " taking things very
easel-ly" (as Mr. TOOLE, for a wonder, does nut
say), and Mr. COVENTRY gives capitally a bit of
novel character as an untidy youth much in
love. It is not a piece with great opportunities, but it will serve till
Mr. J. L. TOOLE gets something better. THE B IN THE Bos.

MORE PLEASANT THAN WELCOME.
DEAR MB. PUNCH,—I know the British Farmer
has a reputation for always gnimbling. But for
all that at last he has a real grievance. Nothing
can be more intolerable than the present weather.
The sun is shining brightly, the birds are singing
their loudest, and the trees are covered with
foliage. Nothing could be more unsatisfactory.
How are we to live if this sort of thing goes
on? It was bad enough last year, but it is
worse this.
And yet when we are all asking for water there
are certain misguided persons who go about exult-
ing in what they call this delightful weather."
Delightful indeed! When we shall have no grass,
nocorn, no fruit," no nothing." And here allow me
to apologise for relapsing into the old-fashioned
expressions of my half-educated father; but these
dreadful times are enough to make one forget
everything—even the style one acquired at a
public school, with a university to follow. And
this very training has proved a curse rather than
a blessing. In the olden davs my father never
troubled himself about the why or the wherefore.
If things were "uncommon bad," he expressed
the sentiment in homely common-place. He did
not trouble to polish his diction, and round off
his sentences. He knew nothing about chemistry,
and merely uttered a bucolic exclamation when
anyone referred to scientific cultivation. He
was better off than I am. Unfortunately I can
appreciate cause and effect, and consequently
regard the present disgusting sunshine with
loathing, and the monotonous song of birds with
a scowl that would not be unbecoming on the
burnt-corked face of a transpontine theatrical
villain.
But why am I writing to you? Why, indeed?
It is in the feeble hope that the thoughtless
and the frivolous who read these lines may
remember that a smile in the presence of a
farmer swearing at the sunshine is a cruelty,
and a word of praise about the "delicious
weather" a deadly insult. Yours truly,
GYLES BE GROGGYNS.
P.S.—My solitary satisfaction lies in the thought that the weather
in this wonderful country is so changeable, that by the time these
lines appear in print it may be snowing.
SPRING THOUGHTS.
(At the Sign of the "Trite '£/».")
THERE is the pond that was frozen;
It is not frozen now!
And a nesting bird has chosen
To build on the bare, black bough,
The wintry bough that was black and bare
Before the leafage of Spring was there.
There is the roadway miry
Where rainy puddles lajr
What time the cab-horse fiery
Splashed all my best array;
But the pools are dry, and the mire is dust,
And the norse is with the saints I trust.
And there is an army of sweepers
Sweeping the ground so dry,
And the ways are filled with weepers
As the pillars of dust go by.
And each man speereth as best he can
For the mystical hydrostatic van.
Above are the dark clouds mooring,
Laden with goodly rain,
And it seems that their freight down-pouring
Never can cease again.
And what is that rumble, heavy and slow?
Is it the foot of the thunder? 'No!
For the rain is tiring, in April's way, [play.
And the sparrows flock down to splash and
Forth of its prison, like frog long dried,
By water at length revivified,
Shamed by the ehower to play its part
Comes the long-lingering water-cart!

THE British Constitution? Yes,

But is there really such a thing

A being inconceivable.

And all is Anarchy till they

For thirty years I 've duly dogged

The strain I cannot bear.

With mine, are faint and frail;

And Mister FUEL 's the last—not least—
Of my presiding band.
From morn to midnight were my hours—

Oft in my clothes I 've had to sleep—

The legislative drone,
And spectral robes for ever bear
Toward a phantom throne.

"FINDING SALVATION."
[In view of the approaching celebration of his "Jubilee," General BOOTH
of the Salvation Army has received letters of warm congratulation and
approval from Sir WILLIAM HARCOURT and Sir EDWARD CLARKE, Q.C.
The former said the General's work was " noble and successful," the latter
declared it " altogether admirable."]
OH! Salvation WILHEMTNA has donned the bonnet blue,
And Hallelujah EDBARD has joined the scarlet crew,
And there is loud rejoicing within the halls of BOOTH,
About the tambourining lass and drum-bedrubbing youth,
For these have "found salvation" upon a larger plan,
Than gratified the worldly wit of CAMPBELL-BANNEHMAN.
A Camp-Belle (on a biggish scale) is WILHEMINA now,
And EDDARD as a Banner-man, will take the cake I trow;
For WILHEMINA ever had a fine flamboyant style,
And EDDARD hath a prim-set mouth and true post-office smile.
Oh, hand her out the tambourine, the big drum strap upon
The shoulders wide of EDDARD. Both have'' found sal-va-ti-on!''
There's a charm for WILHEMINA in a declamation windy,
And EDDARD is susceptible to the song of (holy) shindy.
That Puritanic bonnet fits the lass's lofty "forred,"
And Hallelujah EDDARD won't denounce red shirts as horrid!
Hurroo! The nattiest of bhoys, the bouncingest of girls,
Bethumps the biggest of big drums, the tambourine betwirls.
The Jubilee! The Jubilee! 'Tis coming! Sceptic malice
May mock that hanniversary all at the Crystial Pallis;
But Wirtuous WILHEMINA is no wicked worldly wag,
And 'Oly EDDARD loves to raise (hit species of red flag!
Oh, how the marshalled myriads will be sublimely stirred
When these two lead the Army Band upon July the Third!
One pictures WILHEMINA as she lifts her voice and states
How pious contributions swell these Army Estimates!
One dreams of 'Olv EDDARD, as with neat nutcracker jaw,
He tottles up the Profits, and likewise lays down the Law!
Sublime! And the Ridiculous can never (can it ?) verge
Thereon—in scarlet sweaters, and in garments of blue serge!
Oh, Salvation WILHEMINA! Hallelujah EDDAKD, oh!
Great is the histrionic BOOTH, mighty are Sound and Show!
Vociferous vulgarity, and nubibustio noise,
To Hallelujah Lasses and to Go-to-Glory Boys
Are not confined. No, secular seekers after fame and fun
In following the multitude have oft " found sal-va-ti-on!"

THE ART OP EXPLANATION.
(Extracts from the "Leader-writer's Manual.")
BYE-ELECTIONS (FOR CONSERVATIVE USE).
WHEN the Liberal wins by a decreased majority, this is a Radical
Reduction which shows that the country is sick of a set of political
poltroons, who only are enabled to keep office through the votes of a
brigade of Irish Factionists.
Should the election result in the gain of a seat for the Conservative
party, multiply the above by ten, interlard with peremptory demands
for an immediate dissolution, and serve in leaded type and authorita-
tive paragraphs.
If the Radical improves his position, the election was clearly not
fought on Home Rule, but the Newcastle Programme was dangled
before the eyes of a deluded Electorate, who nibbled the bajt. and in
swallowing the Newcastle jam, also swallowed the Irish pill. This
is a mixture of metaphors, but it looks vigorous.
BYE-ELECTIONS (FOR LIBEBAL USE).
Any Electoral mishap should be attributed to the influence of the
Church and the Public House, about which some choice flowers of
speech should be kept in stock—alliterative for choice. For instance,
say that the Liberal Flowing Tide has been checked by the Tory
Flowing Tied House.
Should the poll be favourable, insist strongly that the present
Government is the most admirable and most enlightened which has •
ever controlled the destinies of the country. Lay special stress on the
fact that a new era has commenced. Don't be deterred from saying
this by the fact that you don't know what the old era was.
It'« a useful thing at times to accuse the other side of intimida-
tion. When you are challenged to give instances, say that thu
Intimidate* (i. e,, the person who was intimidated) would be ruined Hi
you gave his name. It's not magnificent this, even if it is war, bun
it's quite safe.
WHAT DOES LITTLE BIRDIE SAY?
Uncle Charles. "IF WE COULD UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE OF
BIRDS, TOMMV, WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND WHAT DICKY 'a SAYING
A OIF."
Tommy (u-ko's going bad- to School). "I THINK UK 's ASKING FOR
A TIP, UNCLE CHARLES!"
Special note.—If it comes to the worst, blame the out voter. "The
legitimate voice of the residents has been drowned by the imported
votes of those whose only right to vote consists in tnis, that their
names are on the voting list." A carping critic might call this
bathos. But, notwithstanding, it's often capital journalism.
THE COLOUR OF COLLERY'S SUCCESSOR.
["The resignation of Mr. COLLERY, M.P., has not been acted upon,
because neither the Dillon nor the llealy division of the Anti-Parncllite
party can agree'as to the complexion of the candidate who is to be selected
to fill the vacant seat."—Standard.}
A STRANGE disagreement to stop an election!
They can't come to terms on a point of complexion.
If, his cheeks being sallow, he looks like an ill 'un,
Is he likely to please or displease Mr. DILLON?
Shall his colour be rich, shall his colour be mealy,
If he wants to find favour with TIMOTHY HEALY f
Of one thiniy I 'm certain, whatever his h\ie.
Being kept in the cold he is bound to look blue;
And, when Irish meets Irish, and whack follows whack,
To the blue will be added a touch of the black.
Yet the true Irish colour, wherever I 've been
(They swear by and wear it), was always the green.
Soon, soon may there come of the strife an annuller
To settle this Colleric quarrel on colour.
"ORANGE-PEEL."— Sir, I agree with the writer in the St. James's
Gazette last Saturday, and I beg to second the proposal for a bill to
do away with chucking orange-peel on the pavement. I 'd be lor
excepting Ireland from the Act, and let there be as much orange-
peel chucked about there as will upset the Ribbon-Nationalists.
Whoop! Yours, SAM PIPS.

AN "UP-TO-DATE" BALLET.
(As it impressed an Unsophisticated Spectator.)
WHEI? a friend of mine, who is intimately connected with this
periodical, heard that I was coming up to town, he urged me to send
him an account of anything I might see at places of popular enter-
tainment which appeared to me worthy of record. Why, I cannot
think—for I am a quiet country person, and have led hitherto but a
studious and secluded life. But when I raised this objection, he
replied that there would be a value in the impressions of anyone who
came to a performance with what he described as "a fresh eye." I
think I may claim that both my eyes are tolerably fresh, and so I
promised to let him have the benefit of my observations whenever an
opportunity presented itself. It presented itself the other evening.
I nad been dining with a very dear old friend of mine. . . .
(Description of friend and dinner omitted for want of space.—ED.)
and later in the evening, he proposed that we should drop into a plane
of amusement known as the Empire," and
see the "Up-to-Date Ballet" there. I was
greatly struck on entering by the interior.
. . . (Description omitted as superfluous.—
Ep.) We found ourselves just in time to
witness a species of optical illusion called
"Living Pictures," which were indeed mar-
vellously deceptive, some of the figures being
so exquisitely painted that it was difficult to
believe that they were not veritable flesh and
blood. I could almost have sworn I saw one
or two of them move. My companion—think-
ing, I fear, to take advantage of my inex-
perience—endeavoured to persuade me that
they were actually alive but, Provincial as I
am, I was rather too old a bird to be caught
like that. Then there was some juggling by
a gentleman called CINQUEVALLI. I took a
great fancy to him—he was so modest and
unpretending. He seemed surprised and
almost apologetic when his feats succeeded,
which they almost invariably did, as if he
couldn't account for it, and had really had
very little to do with it personally. But I
did not like his attendant. He was a
saturnine young man with a baleful eye, and
it was easy to perceive that he had no belief
in his employer, and expected each trick to
fail, being malignantly disappointed when it
didn't. I think he had discovered that they
were accomplished by using specially con-
structed implements, and that Mr. CINQUE-
VALI.I was obliged to bear with him for fear
he should suddenly turn round and expose
him. If I were a juggler myself, I should
insist upon my attendant preserving at least
an outward respect for me in public. I fear
Mr. CINQUEVALLI is not quite firm enough
w,ith him.
But the crown of the entertainment was of
course the Ballet, which was called—I don't
know why—" The Girl I Left Behind Me."
It began at Epsom on the Race-course, and
young Harry Orerdale, a nice curly-headed,
smooth-faced boy, in a grey frock-coat and

about the walls, and a roof composed entirely of playing-cards. The
Spirit of Gambling introduced mm to a lady on a couch, and then
poor Harry became so hopelessly involved in a ballet of Clubs,
Hearts, Spades, and Diamonds, and was beginning to feel so awk-
ward and m the way, that the Demon of Vires was compelled to
come in and extricate him. Next he was tempted by a lady who
pranced all round him in very short crimson skirts, conduct which,
at first, only shocked and distressed him—and very properly too—
but, gradually, he found himself observing her feet with interest,
and admiring her agility more and more—until he was actually on
the point of embracing her! Fortunately the Genius of Honour
and Courage appeared just when all seemed lost, and directed his
attention to Mary Mayrose^ standing on a rock at the back. So he
woke, with the fixed determination to go and enlist for a soldier, and
his stout and faithful servant, on being informed of his intention,
shook him by the hand, and insisted on enlisting too.
So they were both enlisted by a recruiting sergeant in front of the
H-r-e Guard-", and there was a painful interview between Harry
and his mother, a melancholy lady in grey—
the family colour—who intimated t>y a sort of
stately springiness in her action, that he had
broken her heart. After this, the proceed-
ings were enlivened by the entrance of Miss
Mat/rose's maid, Nellie, a very comely young
woman in a muslin cap, a pink frock, ana
black silk stockings—which last I cannot
help mentioning because they were somewhat
forced upon our notice in the course of an
eccentric dance which she executed in the
presence of a crowd, and with a disregard of
appearances which I confess surprised me.
1 cannot think that a young lady with Miss
Mai/rose's evident sense of propriety would
have approved of her maid s dancing wild
breakdowns in broad daylight in so public a
thoroughfare as Whitehall. I would rather
believe that such an incident is exceptional,
but I intend to go and have a look at the
Horse Guards myself some morning and see
what really goes on there.
Next we were shown a quay, with a troop-
ship ready to start for Burmah. Gentleman
Jack appeared in blue serge and a white
yachting cap, swelling with successful vil-
lainy, though I failed to discover exactly
what he had been about. But—like all real
villains—he had a soft spot in his heart, and
he could not restrain himself from pulling
out a large brass locket containing a likeness
of Miss Mayrose, and gazing at and kissing
it passionately. Then Harry came on in his
new uniform with his mother and sweetheart.
He had joined a Highland regiment, which,
by an odd coincidence, was going out to
Burmah under the command of Colonel May-
rose. The villain tried to prevent him by
showing the Colonel another slip of blue
paper, which had just been brought in by a
messenger boy—but his cunning plot failed,
as the Colonel seemed unable to seize the
drift of the paper, which he pooh-poohed
altogether. Presently Harry's regiment
marched in with flying colours, and turned out
hat, who looked much too young and innocent to frequent such to be a set of as nice-looking young ladies as I ever remember to have
places, came in and explained by signs to the crowd of sportsmen,
bookmakers, gipsies, and acrobats, that he had been betting, and
lost all his money, which seemed to interest but not astonish them.
They were still more interested when the villain, Gentleman Jack,
beheld. / should have expected that poor Mrs. Orerdale and Miss
Mayrose would both have Deen pleased to know that their boy was
drafted into sueh a nice regiment, but it did not seem to console
them in the least. Perhaps they thought that—considering the
came in, and taunted him with his ruin. The villain was plump: vicissitudes of Indian warfare—he would be safer in action with
he had a high complexion, and a good deal of back hair; he more masculine comrades—but the young women (who, I daresay,
wore a straw billycock hat, a cocoa-coloured suit, and chocolate : were "Daughters in Revolt") drilled to absolute perfection, and did
riding-boots, and he carried a hunting-crop, which he showed not seem particularly terrified by their own tire-arms.
Harry triumphantly, together with a slip of blue paper. Then We were then taken to an encampment by moonlight; AW/ie, the

both had their fortunes told by the gipsies, and Harry went home,
resolved on suicide. We next saw him in his chambers, which
seemed to be mostly mantelpiece, preparing to blow his brains out
with a pistol, but, on reflection, deciding to sleep over it. So he
went to sleep on the floor, and had a singular dream. He dreamed
he was in a lurid kind of cavern, with demons and fiends perched
linen, in pursuit of Mary Mayrose, who, it appeared, had not been
left behind after all—(there wasn't any girl that I could find who
had been—except the soldiers)— and was acting as an ambulance
nurse. He forgot himself so far as to seize her, lay his hand on her
mouth, and attempt to abdnct her by force, just outside the very
tent to which the old Colonel had retired with his arm in a sling—

which was rash to the verge of indiscretion, for of course the gallant
officer came out directly and caught him in the act! After that
Colonel ^fat/rose could no longer maintain his objection to Harry as
a son-in-law, and he and Mart/ were united, and Gentleman Jack,
stroking his wrists and pointing to the ground, to express repent-
ance, retired in discomfiture. Then the vanquished Burmese got
up a magnificent ffte in celebration of Harry's gallantry, and
danced nimbly and gracefully, and waved gilded palm branches,
while the Colonel pinned a medal on the young hero s breast. The
Burmese seem a pleasant race, entirely free from malice or ill-
feeling. They have wonderfully fair complexions, too, and are
remarkably attractive in appearance. They wear costumes adapted
to the climate. Altogether I liked the Burmese.
I have endeavoured to give a faithful account of the spectacle as I
saw it, and I wish to state my conviction that these "Up-to-

realistic picture of contemporary 1 fe and manners. Except in
respect to that dance in front of the Horse Guards. I cannot believe

DUE BOOKING-OFFICE.
"I MAY be right or I may be wrong," quoth the Baron; "but,
being in a sporting mood, 1 am prepared to back my opinion of the
high merits of MAKION CRAUFORD'S Katherine Lauderdale from the


sustained interest, their dramatic situa-
tions and their carefully-drawn characters,
vet hitherto nearly all of them have been
localised in Italy, and the dramatis per-
sona consist of types unfamiliar to the
majority of English readers. But here, in
the story of Katherine Lauderdale we
are at home among our English-speaking
American cousins, whose more or less
English habits and manners our un-
travelled countrymen can understand.
The story of Katherine Lauderdale, so far
as MARIOS CRAUFORD has narrated it in
these three volumes, is admirable in its
simple pathos, its unforced humour, and,
above all, in its truth to human nature.
As ZOLA, in his terribly fascinating style, |
has given us the history of that fiendish
Hougon-Macquart family, so, as appears from the final chapter of
this novel, MARION CRAUFORD intends telling us the story of those
members of the Lauderdale family whose acquaintance we make
while reading about Katherine Lauderdale. The novel is not yet
ended, these three volumes are only an appetising instalment. The
Baron has two faults to find, and one question to put. The first
fault is, that most of the characters, especially the light-hearted
and intentionally epigrammatic personages, talk at too great a
length. The talk is good, but in real life these persons would be
bores of the first magnitude. The second fault is tne employment of
so old a device as the detention of a letter. True that this familiar
modus operandi is well done, and granted that the action may be
consistent with the character of the man who is guilty of such mean-
ness, though that this is so is not made absolutely clear. But, where
all the other incidents of the complication are so naturally arranged,
and where so much originality is shown in the combination, surely
just another turn of the thinking machine would have provided the
author with a newer device than this. Now comes the IJaron's one ,
question. When Kutherine Lauderdale was secretly married to Jack \
Jtrilst(»i,Bhe came out of the Church with the wedding ring on her
finger. The story does not say so, but we may take the fact for granted.
Now, the last thing any true woman, on becoming a bride, would do,
is to take off that ring. It is not mentioned that Katherine removed
it. How does the author account for the ring having escaped every-
body's notice, especially that of her mother and her married sister?
Of course, if Katherine took it off soon after it was put on, there is
the answer; hut "'tis not in the bond," I cannot find it in the
book, and, if it be there, would that action be consistent with
Katherine s character? Mayhap, the author of her being, MARION
CRAUFORD himself, will tell us in his next." But long dialogue or
short dialogue, incident probable or improbable, there is not a tedious
page or paragraph in the three volumes, even when the author pauses
to analyse the motives of the beings to whom he has given local
habitation and name. At least, such is the opinion of the
BARON DE BOOK-WORMS.

AIR—" Miss Bailey's Ghost."
A COVE at Hucknall Torkard turned the touchiest of Tarters;
On a " Conciliation Board" he railed. Oh, stars and garters!
He said his conscience smited him, and made him grumble daily;
But 'twas his narsty temper what so worked on Mister BAILEY.
Oh, Mister BAILEY! Unfortunate Mister BAILEY!
Consarnin' of the Minimum Wage he got into a fever,
Says he, "That SHAXD 's a clever man, but he's a sly deceiver!"
He pounded on in platformese until his face blanched palely;
He was a-fighting of a ghost, poor bitter Mister BAILEY.
Oh, Mister BAILEY! Unfortunate Mister BAILEY!
"Avaunt Conciliation SHAND!" he shrieked in accents squeally,
But people thought the Chairman he had used most ungenteelly,
As a Conciliator Mister BAILET acted frailly,
And even Colliers couldn't all back up poor Mister BAILEY.
Oh, Mister BAILEY! Ill-tempered Mister BAILEY!
Oh boasting BAILEY your account with anger once for all close!
Keep on your hair, and be your shirt tucked well within your small-
clothes!
Conciliation needs good temper; then 'twill go on gaily, [BAILEY.
And Labour as true friends will then remember SHAND—and

Mu. AUBREY BKER DE
BEERS,
You 're getting quite
a high renown;
Your Comedy of Leers,

Is posted all about the

This sort of stuff I can-
not putt',
As Boston says, it
makes me " tired";
Your Japanee-Rossetti

Is not a thing to be
desired.
Mr. AciiREY BEER DE
BEERS,

cuse the chaff)

mour style,
It 's not a thing at
which to laugh;
But all the same, you need not maim
A beauty reared on Nature's rules;
A simple maid au naturel
Is worth a dozen spotted ghouls. .
MR. AUBREY BEER DE BEERS,
You put strange phantoms on our walls
If not so daring as To-day's,
Nor quite so Hardy as St. Paul's;
Her sidelong eyes, her giddy guise,—
Grande l)ame Sans Merci sne may be;
But there is that about her throat
Which I myself don't care to see.
MR. AUBREY BEER DE BEERS,
The Philistines across the way,
They say her lips—well, never mind
Precisely what it is they say •
But I have heard a drastic word
That scarce is fit for dainty ears;
But then their taste is not the kind
Of taste to flatter BEER DE BEERS.
Bless me, AUBREY BEER DE BEERS,
On fair Elysian lawns apart
Burd HELEN of the Trojan time
Smiles at the latest mode of Art;
Howe'er it be, it seems to me,
It's not important to be New;
New Art would better Nature's best,
But Nature knows a thing or two.
AUBREY, AUBREY BEER DE BEERS,
Are there no models at your gate,
Live, shapely, possible and clean?
Or won t tney do to " decorate"?
Then by all means bestrew your scenes
With half the lotuses that blow,
Pothooks and fishing-lines and things,
But let the human woman go!
BEFORE SUPPEE.
SLOW, dignified dancing;, a decorous
sight,
Prevails before supper, when people ore
cool;
The accurate Lancers, infallibly right,
The waltz, grave and stately—no play-
ing the fool,
As does TOOLE.
Then elderly charmers, still trusting to
chance
To bring them all partners, compla-
cently wait
For elegant gentlemen eager to dance—
Not TOOLES, rather IRVINGS, grand,
graceful, grave, great,
And sedate.
AFTER SUPPER.
WHEN supper is over frigidity goes,
Frivolity comes—now for playing the
fool!
In Lancers linked lines dart regardless of
toes,
In vigorous barn dance they caper, for
who'll
Now be cool?
The sad, weary wallflowers watch with
dazed eyes
Such dancing as they have, no doubt,
never done.
What matter if they should evince some
surprise?
When supper is over the best of the

102, Temple Gardens, E. C. L. ERXKD COUNSEL.
THE LITIGANT IN PERSON.
DEAR Sis,—I have often in the communications which you are good
enough to insert in your pages, and which there are read throughout
your kingdom—the wide, wide world—I have often referred to the
fact that legal business is bad. The depression in trade is respon-
sible, no doubt, for a good deal. Litigation is an expensive luxury,
and a reduced income leads its owner to use bad words, and indulge
in fewer actions. Lawsuits are among the first articles of which a
man divests himself. Still, bad trade is not responsible for every-
thing. The law's delay is another cause, and I know of many others.
Of one I should like to express myself in terms which I am sure you
wouldn't print. So as to save you the pain which I am confident you
would feel at using the blue pencil, I will restrain myself, and merely
sum up what I mean by saying that when a litigant becomes personal
he (or she) becomes offensive.
The litigant in person is, in my opinion, one of the reasons why
we men at the Bar are having hard times. It is obvious at once
that every one of this class of wretched creatures means that we
have been defrauded of at least one brief, probably very many more.
Appearing in person seems attractive very often to ladies. I even
recollect one case within my own knowledge where a lady conducted
her own case against a formidable array of counsel, which included
two leading silks. She did it, I am bound to say, extremely
well, and it was decidedly inspiriting to hear the lady—who had
considerable personal attractions—referring to an eminent O..C. as
"my learned friend." She was, however, an exception. Speaking
generally, personal litigants take guineas out of our pockets, conduct
their own case in the worst possible way, spoil the tempers of our
sweetest-mannered Judges (thereby making miserable the countless

And upstart-Malt-olio for long have been foes!
You 're three hundred years old, but yet jolly and fruky;
Still slily you joke with a reprobate tongue!
Though born ere the age of split sodas and whiskey,
You noisy old boy, you 're eternally young.
Most potnnt, irreverend senior and songster,
What think you of England and us of to-day,
Of "movements" and " questions " that our petty throng stir,
Of Anarchy, Woman, and bards of Dtcay?
Nay, I hear vou dismiss such " kickshaws" with a hiccup—
You date from the rollicking times of Queen BESS!
Your motto profound's " Tillivallv, and snick up!"
(The meaning I '11 leave the kind reader to guess.)

Extracting with catches " a weaver's three souls!"
Long may you "do that," though Blue-Ribbonites might howl

SPORTING NOTE.—It is reported that a forthcoming volume of the

A CALL FROM ARMS.
(Extracted from the Note-Boot of our Prophet
Reporter.)
THE first meeting of the nations summoned
by the Arbitration League was numerously
attended, and as equality was to be the first
consideration, it was unanimously agreed that
the proceedings should be carried on without
the assistance of a chairman.
Jony BULL, as the originator of the move-
ment, was the first speaker. He said there
wai no doubt that a very large sum was ex-
pended upon armaments. If the money that
was paid away upon guns and ammunition
could be used for other purposes there was
no doubt that the expenditure would be of
far greater practical utility to the people it
was his pride and honour to represent.
Madame LA REPUHLIQUE cordially endorsed
the sentiments of her Western neighbour. She
was fond of thrift herself, and believed that
war was an unmixed evil. It would be so
much better to save the millions of pounds
expended upon soldiers and sailors. What
would they want with armed men if every-
one consented to live in peace and give up
quarrelling? By all means abolish standing
armies, and avoid the cost. It would be so
much wiser to save than to squander.
The German EMPBBOE (who insisted upon
appearing in person) was of the same opinion.
He was very fond of soldiering, but no fonder
of that employment than of any other. He
believed he would be just as nappy stage-
managing, or preaching, or teaching nis entire
people everything. He had reasons for be-
lieving that the military service in the
Fatherland was a drain upon the country.
This was not only injurious to the Teutonic
race in general, but (what was of far greater
importance) to the Hohenzollern family in
particular. By all means let the nations
disarm. It was a most admirable idea. How-
ever, he did not think that a universal and
simultaneous disarmament would be possible.
He for one would decline to lay down his
arms before Madame LA REPUBLIQUE had
set him the example.
The meeting was then addressed by repre-
sentatives of Russia, Austria, Italy, Turkey,
and even Spain. After a very long discussion,
JOHN BULL said that he was nothing if not
practical. The first thing to be done was to
disarm, as suggested by his young friend the
German EMPEHOB. But who _ should begin?
He begged to move that a decision be arrived
at as early as possible.
The subject was still under consideration
when our report left, and an immediate
settlement seemed highly improbable.
BALLADE OF THE EIGHTS.
(For those about to Train or in Training for
"the College Eights.")
THE burden of hard training—eat away
Each morning at thy porridge and thy
steak,
Cram down thy buttered-eggs and whiting—
yea,
Of marmalade unsparingly partake;
Of port—a little, for thy stomach's sake
At night to wake thy strength and manly
fire;
Put from thee pipes and WILLS his Golden
Flake.
This is the end of every man's desire.
The burden of long journeys—when the coach
Runs on the bank with loud and wrathful
cries,
And heaps thy head with heavy, hard reproach,
Praying that Fate may overtake thine eyes
To their complete destruction, in this wise:
"Bow! when you finish, bring those hands
up higher,
And as you're swinging" (language) "let
them rise."
This is the end of every man's desire.
The burden of much bumping—when the
swing
Grows shorter than the swing of heretofore,
A burden without joy in quickening
Thy stroke from thirty-seven to two-score,
When those thou scornedst paddle on before.
And those thou mockedst at come nigh and
nigher,
And curses reach thee from the farther
shore.
This is the end of every man's desire.
But when thy toil is over, take thy rest •
And if thou hast a sweet and juicy briar,
Light it, and cease from sadness, being
blessed.
This is the end of every man's desire.

THE BOOK MANIAC'S
VADE MECUM.
Question. I suppose you
believe yourself to be a sup-
porter of literature?
Anmcer. Distinctly. I
spend enormous sums for
books at one tithe of their
existing value.
Q. Are volumes without
their covers of any use '(
A. It depends entirely
upon the date of their publi-
cation. Some works are more
valuable than others when
they appear in their early
paper leaves.
Q. And yet a common
cloth shield may make an
enormous difference in the
price of a book published in
the earlier decades of the
century?
A. Assuredly.
Q. As a collector, would
you desire the pages to be in
perfect condition?
A. Certainly; and I should
esteem it a great advantage
if they were uncut.
Q. If there were a mis-
take in the setting up of the
type, would you count that
as a flaw?
A. No. On the contrary,
if the error were subse-
quently corrected, I should
deem the misprint a great
find, and one to be highly
valued.
Q. You say that you would
like the pages to be uncut;
would not that cause the
reading of a book to be diffi-
cult, if not impossible?
A. Certainly; but that
would be no disadvantage.
Q. Then you do not pe-
ruse the works you purchase?
A. Why, of course not; I
only desire to possess them.

MAN AND BEAST.—From
a recent case it would ap-
pear that lions and other
"wild fowl" are unprotected
by the law against cruelty
because they are not "do-
mesticated" animals. If so,
the Law in this case is in-
deed "a hass," a veritable
"Bully Bottom." If the lion
is not to be "protected"
against man, it seems only
fair that man should not be
protected against the lion.
Let lion and man be left to
settle it, with Nature's wea-
pons, out in the open, and
probably the " domesticated
beast" would be the first to
howl for " protection."

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Comntons. Monday, April 9.—SQTJIBE OF MtiwooD in
excellent form to-night. All the morning papers aflame with
apprehension. Ministerial crisis imminent. Government proposed
to take the time private Members had laboriously won at the ballot.
Private Members naturally resented the flat burglary. Now's the
opportunity for Opposition to strike in and bowl over Ministry. The
Parnellites have broken away; the Nationalists no longer come up
to time; the Liberal private Members in state of revolt; days of the
Ministry surely numbered.
House crowded to fullest capacity, in anticipation of critical divi-
-ion. Must be anxious moments on Treasury Bench. Within next
eight hours Government's fate settled. There may be other evictions
to consider beyond those that concern the Irish tenant. A great occa-
-ion; much depended upon whether the SQUIRE would rise to it. He
lid better still. He (apparently) fell far below it. Temptation for
(rdinary man in such circumstances to raise the war-whoop; take
'ip with grand air the challenge thrown down; make a speech that
should animate friends, irritate foes, till the thronged House with
exhilarating thunder of cheers and counter cheers. SQUIRE not an
ordinary man. Proved himself a great artist. Successfully affected
to be wholly unconscious of any condition approaching crisis.
Nothing more common-place than the situation. It was the 9th
"f April. At least no one could deny that. According to present
arrangements Ministers had eight nights a month in which to carry
•m business of the nation. Supposing House sat till 10th of August,
lhat would be thirty-two days.
There was a movement in the quarter behind the Front Opposi-
tion Bench which Mr. MELLOR cannot see. Hon. gentlemen sitting
there would like to have denied the SQUIRE'S assumption that four
eights are thirty-two. But it couldn't be done. Even if it were
possible, who so stony-hearted as to be disposed to utter note of con-
tradiction addressed to big meek figure standing at table, hoping it
did not intrude, but, being there, cooing little nothings, none much
in itself, hut the procession irresistibly leading up to the conclusion
lhat the House would gracefully yield to necessity and give up to the
Government what was meant for private Members.
PRINCE ARTHUR visibly affected. Had come down prepared to
fight; was disarmed as he entered the lists. To strike at the figure
now modestly seated on Treasury Bench, withdrawing itself as far as
possible from public gaze under the compression of folded arms,
would be like hitting a woman. PRINCE ARTHUR couldn't do it.
JOSEPH le«s susceptible: when his time came girded at the SQUIKE
and the Ministry. But he was evidently out of tune with the general
feeling. His asperities found no echo save in the jeering cries of the
Members opposite mad with delight when once, losing his way under
unwonted circumstances of his reception, the SPEAKER called him to
order. One by one the private Members whose ewe lamb had been
taken, kissed the hand stretched forth to rob them. Only two Par-
nellites, including the Leader, showed up, and when division bell
rang they shrank from voting against the Government. So the
black thundercloud melted away and the sun shone on the SQUIRE'S
pathway.

happily, out by the ventilator with other vitiated particles of atmos-
phere.
Ages ago GRANDOLPH fell upon SCLATEB-BOOTH with savagely-
spoken declaration that he had ever observed that mediocrities
were apt to furnish themselves with double-barrelled mties. A
Eretty remark^ as was felt at the time, to
ill from the lips of a SPENCER-CHURCHILL.
In case of Member for Belfast the accident
of double-barrelled name is appropriate and
explicable for quite other reasons than those
alleged in case of a gentleman who, ns
speedily as possible, lost his obnoxious appel-
lation in the title of a Peerage.
"Listening to him on any subject," says
tb.3 Member for Sark, "more especially the
Navy, one instinctively feels that, anything
short of a double-barrelled name would be
ludicrously out of proportion with ARNOLD-
FORSTEH'S personality. He could not sup-
port all he knows on monosyllabic, or even
trisyllabic name, such as GLADSTONE or
HARCOURT or BALFOUR."

below him, probably anxious at interruption, which might threaten
or delay his measure, should be at once reassured.
"Mr. SPEAKER, Sir," said the ex-Lord Mayor of London; " >

SPEAKEB interposed. With blandest air
explained that if Sir JAMES did not rise to
offer opposition he was out of Court. "I
am bound," said the SPEAKER, "at this stage
to hear speeches against the Bill, not to
listen to any in favour of it."
For a moment old instincts of Lord Mayor
prevailed. WHITEHEAJ), with lips parted
by unfinished sentence, remained on his
feet confronting SPEAKER. Would he call
on his sword-bearer, his mace-bearer, and
eke his chaplain to come forward, carry forth
the right hon. gentleman, and bring nim up
at the Mansion House? Possibly had he
been still in office he misjit, in the cir-
cumstances, have felt justified in adopting
that extreme but constitutional course. But
long ago he stepped down from the Civic
throne. He had no longer at beck and call
sword-bearer or mace-bearer, and had to
share the common ministrations of a chap-
lain. In circumstances, especially as angry
cries of "Order!" were rising round him,
he sat down, ruefully pocketing the notes
of his speech.
"Ah!" said CAI-'EN TOMMY BOWLES,

THE BUDGET WASTE-PAPER BASKET.
(Imaginary Samples of Possible Contents.)
DKAR SIR WILLIAM,—Now that you are busily employed in
preparing your Budget, I think [it the duty of everyone—inclusive,
of course, of members of my sex—to send you suggestions. Although
I coxild have married over and over again, had I pleased, I have
preferred to remain single. Still, I know that many of my
dear female friends have never received a single proposal. No, my
dear Sir WILLIAM, not one. It is in their aid that I make the
following suggestions:—
1. Let every Club with a subscription of two guineas and upwards
be taxed at the rate of eighteen shillings in the pound.
•2. Let every man attaining the age of five-ana-twenty be asked if
he proposes to marry, and then, if he does not, let four-fifths of his
income be annexed for the use of the State.
3. Let a ten shilling duty be imposed upon Manilla cheroots, and
a pro ratfi duty upon cigars of a yet more expensive quality.
There, my dear Sir WILLIAM, if you take these hints, I am sure you
will not only get a satisfactory revenue, but please the ladies. And
what more can you want? Yours gushingly,
A MAIDEN WELL OUT OF HER TEENS.
RIGHT HON. SIR,—For the last five years I have been staying in
retreat at Hanwell, attempting to solve the great problem of how to
make both ends meet with a rising expenditure and a falling
revenue. You follow me, Right Hon. Sir? With a rising expendi-
ture and a falling revenue I Now it seems to me, Right Hon. !Sir, if
you take the Death Duties, multiply them by ten, and then think of a
number, you must get within reasonable distance of a surplus—say
that of the Archbishop of CANTERBURY. But failing this, why not
trust to the Income Tax. Why not remit as much of this impost as
will serve for a lever, and then put the remainder on to the winter
favourite for the Derby? I merely throw this out as a suggestion,
with a right of pre-emption vested in the Beadle of the Burlington
Arcade. And now to breakfast with what appetite ye may !—Yours
to the last drop, THE EMPEROR OF CHINA, IHSUUISED AS
BALBUS, WITO BUILT A WALL.
DI:AR SIR WILLIAM HARCOURT,—I don't know you, and you don't
know me. But my father often talks of you and says how well you
are. I daresay he's right. From what he says it seems you are
framing a Budget. Well, frame away, I don't mind. But if you
want a real tip you take my advice. Tax all the schools. They are
not a bit of good, and a serious nuisance to men of talent until they
reach the age of fifteen and upwards.
Your affectionate little friend, JONES MINOR.
MY DEAR SIR.—You will have come to me in the long run. You
may have a free breakfast table, a free luncheon bar, a free every-
thing, but they won't help you. Take my advice and stick to the
income tax, and for final advice rely on

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ON FAUST.
Sra,—Putting aside the admirable acting of HENRY IRVING as
Mephistopheles, of ELLEN TKRBY as Margaret, and of Mr. TEKRISS
as Faust, and dismissing from our
minds any particular representation
of the play, what a "queer story"
(apologising to the proprietor of
Truth for using this title) is this
same tale of Faust and Margaret..'
Is Mephistopheles the "very devil
incarnate," or is he a subordinate
fiend? If he is the devil himself,
why all this trouble to catch one
soul, to the apparent neglect of
business all over the world? Is
Faust so big a fish as to warrant
his monopolising the entire atten-
tion of Mephistopheles?
Mephistopheles is a Cretan of
Cretans. When can you believe
him? Whtn he pledges his word
to the bond that Faust signs,
or when, as in GOETHE'S dra-
matic poem, he says, "Have I
all twicer in hearen and upon
earth :<* /'// cloud the senses of
the tcarder,—do thou possess thy-
self of the keys, and lead her forth
with human hand. I trill keep
watch' The magic steeds are
waiting, I bear thee off. Thug
much is in my power!" But
surely so much was almost in the
power of any artful human being,
provided always that the gaolers
would yield to the temptation of
drink (with a soporific admixture
in it), or could be otherwise "got
at" with a bribe.
The compact entered into between
Dr. Henry Fatistus on the one
part, and Mephistopheles on the
other, is in these terms, dictated
by the Doctor himself:—
If ever to the passing hour I say,
"So beautiful thou art, I thv flight
delay!"

Betting Mephistopheles; or, The Magic Eing-Man.
moment specified in the contract arrived, then and not afterwards,
both delinquents willingly sinning, and Faust appreciating the
present moment to the very uttermost. Then, according to the
bond, should Mcphistopheles have stepped in. He could have
captured both fish at one haul.
Yet Mephistopheles allows this
time to pass, and, at a moment
when Faust's sentiments towards
the world are distinctly in opposi-
tion to those mentioned in the con-
ditions of the bond, the satirical
jesting fiend, of power limited,
says, "Come with me," and with
him Faust has to go, in spite of the
voice of Margaret heard in the air
crying faintly, "HENRY! HENRY!"
—which, by the by, might have
been legitimately and appropriately
retained in the Lyceum version.
If Mephistopheles can take him,
at any time, without reference
to the stipulated conditions, why
were they ever brought into the
bond?
And there's this peculiarity about
Mephistopheles, namely, that, as a
personality, he is always and every-
where undoubtedly popular with
the entire audience. Yet if he
were on the Adelphi stage, a human
villain, actually seen committing
murder, caught as it were on the
stage red-handed, and aiding and
abetting a variety of other crimes,
including the utter ruin of a voting
and lovely heroine, and all the
time cynically nesting about his
•victims, would he not, while ad-
mired for his art, be called before
the curtain only to be howled at and
execrated for his enormities? Cer-
tainly. But why is this not the
fate of Mephistopheles t That it is
not so is evident. The Fiend is
popular. There is " no deniging of
it, BETSY." The Fiend is abso-
lutely laughed at as an absurd

But what happens? At the supreme moment when Margaret
yields herself to Faust, Mephistopheles is off duty! Then has the

TOL, CVL
MRS. MORE-OR-LESSINGHAM.
THE acting in the play called Mrs. Lessingham, at the Garrick
Theatre, is, on the whole, about as good as acting can be. Of course
it happens unfortunately for this particular drama that The Second
Mrs. Tant/iterat/ came first, and so rather belittled Mrs. Lessingham,
and made her Mrs. Less-and-Lessingham. As for the scenery, the
picture of The High Moor near Castle Glen is certainly one of the
finest and most striking examples of scenic art, that is of genuine
artistic scene painting, at present to be seen on any London stage.
For a long time it will be indeed very hard to beat, and Mr. "W.
HARFOED is to be heartily congratulated on a real triumph. The
dramatic scenes as they stand apart are good though not great; but,
unfortunately, the foundation of the piece crumbles away at the
first touch of critical analysis. It is said that Money is to be im-
mediately revived with a very strong cast, which is to include the
BANCROFTS. If there is little interest in Mrs. Lessinr/hain, there
ought to be a high rate of interest for Money. It is in rehearsal;
so 'tis not as yet "ready Money." Good omen. Success in view,
and " Here we Hare again!" say Mr. and Mrs. BANCROFT.

DONNA QUIXOTE.
THE dreamy Don who to the goatherds told
Lone-winded legends of the Age of Gold,
Finds a fair rival in our later days;
The newest Chivalry brings the newest Craze.
Dear Donna QUIXOTE—and the sex is dear,
Even when querulous, or quaint, or queer—
Dear Donna, like La Mancha's moonstruck
knight,
Whose fancy shaped the foes he burned to
fight.
Mere book-bred phantoms you for facts mis-
take;
Your Wanderjahr will vanish when you—
wake!
Yes, there you sit surrounded by wild hosts
Of warring wonders which indeed are
"Ghosts";
"DolPt-House" delirium sets your nerves
a-thrill,
"DODO" hysteria misdirects your will;
You yearn—indefinitely—to Advance!
You shake your lifted latch-key like a lance!
And shout, "In spite of babies, bonnets, tea,
Creation's heir, I must, I will be—Free i"
Morbid conceptions born of books ferment
In brains a-burn with febrile discontent!
So the dear Don, with dream-disordered head,
His fancy fired with all that he had read-
Enchantments, contests, challenges, and
scars—
Found rustic Arragon a world of wars,
Windmills fierce foea, and e'en domestic sheep
Destructive demons.
Donna, could you keep
That trim-coiled "hair on"—pray forgive
the slang!—
You do in Dodo /—let the fads go hang,
And " realise yourself" in natural sort,
For churls and cynics you should make less
sport.
These shapes are things of mirage and the
mist.
Gendered by genius with a mental twist;
By male hysteria, Amazonian sham,
And the smart world's great J-'in de Siecle
flam!
See Mrs. Cerberus in your cloudy vision,
Keeping the portals of that Home Elysian
Which cranks now call a Hades! Home,
sweet home?
Nay, 'tis a gaol to those who long to roam,
Unchaperoned, emancipate, and/ree,
With the large Liberty of the Latch-key!
Materfamilias and the chaperon grim,
Of watchful eye, firm mouth, and triple chin,
Are Mrs. GRUITDY'S brace of stout supporters,
Three - headed guard of our Revolting
Daughters!
You, Donna QUIXOTE, to this ward—or
these—
Would but too gladly play the Hercules,
Urged by the CALEBS, and CRACKANTHOBPES,
and G n A .v i is I
These demon-weavers of domestic bands,
Who 've snared the Daughter of the Day, and
bound her,
As the bard sings, with dark Styx nine times
round her,
Do not exist, dear Donna, save in dreams,
Like QUIXOTE'S Caraculiambo! Gleams
Of common sense and glorious hope illume
(As dawn's first rosy streaks break night's
black gloom)
The sex's future. The dull despot, man,
Backed by the bondage of the social plan,
Shall not for ever unrestricted sway.
But Donna dear, not by the masher's way,
Or MILL'S or the sham Amazons, or CAIRN'*

Midway between a maniac and a troll;

Its pot-bound limitations—all the cants
Of culture's cranks, and extra-ethic dolts,
Whose fetish is the Gospel of Revolts,—
Not these shall shed one single lustrous ray
Of light divine upon the bitter way,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AN EVENING WITH A THOUGHT-READER.
The Scene is an Upper Hall in the Suburban Assembly Rooms in
which MR. COLIN MAILLABD it about to give an exhibition of his
Thought-reading powers. On the platform is Mr. MAILLABD,
with a simple apparatus, consisting of a black board and a de-
canter of water. At the back, on a row of chairs, are the
Committee, who have just—after prolonged anrf complicated con-
sultations such as attend the formation of a French ministry—
elected a Chairman. Their general attitude is expressive of
acute personal discomfort, combined with a stern sense of duly
and dark suspicion of Thought-reading as an imposition which
it trill be their painful mission to expose.
Mr. Colin Maillard (coming forward). I shall begin with a little
experiment which I performed with remarkable success before His
Majesty the King of DENMABK and several members of his family.
(Several ladiet in the front rows smile with pleasant anticipation.)
I am going to ask some gentleman on
the Committee to fix his thoughts in-
tently upon some object on this plat-
form. (To a Committee-man.) Will
you oblige me, Sir? Thank you. (The
Committee-man, having contented, be-
gins the experiment by looking par-
ticularly foolish.) When you nave
settled what it is to be, perhaps you
will tell the Chairman—not aloud—
and it must be something on the plat-
form, not above it; and you must
think of nothing else. I can't make a
man think if he wan't—or if he can't.
(Here, for some inscrutable reason,
the Committee-man takes offence, ins-
pects that it is " a catch of some sort,"
and abruptly declines to hare anything
further to do with it; whereupon Mr.
COLIN MAILLABD expresses his feelings
by a disgusted shrug. A second Com-
mittee-man nobly volunteers to assist
the lecturer, selects an object for private
meditation, informs the Chairman in
strict confidence, and Mr. C. M., after
blindfolding himself', pressing the.
Thinker's hand to his own forehead,
and seizing him by the wrist, proceeds
to rush about the platform with a view
to discovering the article, while hia
companion follows him passively, evi-
dently wondering tchether he looks o.v
helpless an idiot as he feels. Mr. COLIN
M., after much meandering, has made
a point at the decanter, which he pats
pensively for some time, until he is in-
formed that he is on a false track.)
Very well—you 're sure you 're think-
ing of nothing else all the time? I '11
try again then. (He does, and almost
upsets the black board.) Mind, if you
don't want me to find it, I can't. (The
Thinker assures him that he does want
him to find it very much.) I never
had so much difficulty in all my life.'
(He has now worked round to the Com-
mittee, and after some patting and groping, extracts a card from a
member's breast-pocket; the Thinker refrains from giving the
slightest indication; the audience, who are totally in the dark at
present, lose faith in Mr. C. M., who is obviously annoyed and dis-
concerted.) Am I wrong again 1 Then all I can say is—eh, what P
That is the article? 1 ask you to tell me when I succeed. Ladies
and Gentlemen, this is the object thought of, and I have found it, as
I undertook to do! (Loud applause from the audience: the Com-
mittee reluctantly concede that this is one to Mr. MAILLARII, but
seem hopeful of catching him before the evening is over.) Now my
next experiment will be of a more interesting character. I shall ask
the assistance of some member of the audience who is able to draw.
I can't draw myself. Can't draw a bit! But if anyone will think
of an animal that he wishes to have drawn, and see it clearly enough
in his own mind, I shall be able to draw it blindfolded on this board
before you all. Is there anyone here who can draw? (Ao response.)
What, no one! (With pathos.) No one in all this large audience
who is able to draw! (The audience look at one another reproach-
fully, as persons who really ought to have acquired this useful
accomplishment.) Most remarkable thing I ever knew in all my
life! . . . If you can't draw, I can't make you.
[He regards them with sorrow and pity.
A Matron (to her husband). What nonsense, Pa! You can draw
animals very nicely when you like.'
Pa (modestly). Only in a very amateur way, my love. I can
do a pig, and so on, to please the children, that's all.
The Matron. Then go up, Pa, only you mustn't make it a pig, or
he '11 guess it at once.
[Pa rises, amidst applause, and is invited to mount the plat-
form; he mentally selects his animal, and tells the Chair-
man, who appears to think highly of it. Mr. C. M. blindfolds
himself, puts Pa's hand to his forehead, instructs him to
hold him lightly by the wrist, and concentrate his whole
powers of thought on the animal; they both advance to the
alack board, amidst intense excitement.

it was an eleph—no, it can't be—it|s
got pointed ears ; it's more like a rabbit
... no, it' s got wings. . . Well, I
declare he's rubbed it out again!
Mr. C. M. I 'm afraid I shall have
no chance of succeeding with this par-
ticular subject. There are some indi-
viduals who are absolutely incapable of
concentrating their thoughts for any
length of time, and this gentleman
appears to be one of them.
[He politely dismisses Pa as con-
victed of incompetency, and
he returns to his seat to find
his popularity departed.
The Matron. Well, Pa, a nice ex-
hibition you 've made of yourself!
Pa (with a feeble tmile). I rather
thought I should puzzle him, my love
—it was a rhinoceros.
The Matron. I might have known
it would be something ridiculous;
you 'd better have stuck to a pig after
all! (A Member of the Committee
has represented himself as able to
draw anything except animals, and
Mr. C. M. has been reduced fo accept
his assistance.) Now, Pa, watch this
man thinking and see how he does it.
Mr. C. M. (who has rubbed out one
design and completed another, which
is like nothing in the world except a
proposition conceived by Euclid in ex-
treme dotage}. I can't get any nearer
to it than that. Would you mind
drawing your own picture side by
side?
[The Committee-man bashfully executes a scrawl, which, as he
explains, represents a yacht under full sail.
Mr. C. M. (to the audience). You see, there is a certain resem-
blance between the two—only I drew one sail on the other, and
mixed the masts up a little. I told you I couldn't draw. (Applause.
The Committee waver, though several are still inclined to scepticism.
A Coloured Committee-man is requested to choose any lady among
the audience to whom he wishes a flower to be presented—whether he
knows her or not. He confides his choice coyly to the Chairman.
Mr. C. M. is blindfolded and drags the Coloured Gentleman, who is
smiling affably, to a lady in the middle of the third row, whom he
presents, greatly to her confusion, with a buttonhole.) Mr. Chair-
man, will you kindly inform the audience whether this experiment
was correctly performed or not?
The Chairman (rising with dignity). Quite correct. And also the
manner in which the itower was presented was perfectly correct. I
may add that the lady is a relation of my own.
[Enthusiastic applause; the Committee regard him as a Lost
Leader. Their demoralisation is complete when Mr. C. M.
undertakes to write up on the board the number of a
bunk-note in the possession of the greatest sceptic among
them, and actually does it without a single error. The

entertainment concludes with an Amateur Murder. Mr.
C. M. retires to a waiting-room with the Chairman and a
member of the Committee. Two other members of amiable
and harmless exterior are chosen by the audience as assassin
and robber respectirely. They select a rictim for sacrifice
from the spectators, lead him on the platform^ where they
seem rather at a Ivss to know hoic to dispose of him. Finally,
one throttles him from behind and stabs him irith a pen-
knife, while the other holds him up by the heels, and robs
him of half-a-crmnt, which he hides in a hat belonging to
somebody in the balcuny. The audience express their high
approral of the genertil style and finish of this criminal ex-
ploit, and the rictim returns complacently to his seat. Mr.
C. M. is called back and blindfolded: discorers the victim
at once, takes him back to the platform, and repeats the
crime in e>-ery detail, eren to holding him up by the heels;
after which he mukes an impetuous rush, holding the
robber's hand, to the balcony, where he triumphantly ex-
tracts the half-crown from the hat. Unanimous applause,
in which the Committee, who are now completely converted,
join with enthusiasm.
The Chairman. I 've only to say on behalf of the Committee, that
we are all quits contented; everything has been perfectly above-
board and, (solemnly) to myself, inexplicable.

trill lead to very useful and practical results one of these
days. Pa, hotcerer, is of opinion that the entertainment
would hare been more satisfactory, from a scientific point of
new, had the lecturer succeeded in realising his rhinoceros;
though—as he admits to being rather hazy as to whether he
meant it to hare one horn or two, and where its tail went
precisely—this objection is perhaps a little unreasonable.
DECIDEDLY QUAINT.

WHAT must have been a most interesting ceremony took place at
the Friends' Meeting House, York, when the Lord Mayor; who is
a member of the Society of Friends, attended the service in state,
on which occasion, as appears from a picture in the Daily Graphic
of April 17, somebody chucked the sword of state on to the head of
His Worship sitting below, while somebody else in turn-down collars
most unwarrantably whacked the bald skull of a peaceable old
gentleman with the official mace!! Some of the excellent Friends
must have been inclined to raise a protest against the dramatic
action of Punch and Judy being introduced within the walls of a
decorous meeting house. Their scruples, we may suppose, were
ultimately satisfied.

THE BOOBYGONE.
(By the Author of "Doritdon't.")
BOOK I.
SHE sat down in her mother's chair, who was pouring her out a cup
of tea (this is my usual arrangement of relative pronouns). Then she
went with her uncle for a ride, who disappeared completely after-
wards; the first oooby gone. Later on her
father also disappeared; another booby
gone. In fact, all the men in this book are
boobies. Lord DAZE was a booby also, who
was so very far gone that he asked her to
marry him. "1 will be your wife," she
said, letting her hands drop down by her
side. Being a courteous gentleman, he
Picked up her hands for her. She looked
at him steadily—and the elongated chiaros-
curo of monotonous meridians had passed
from her life for ever. Not long after, at
Mentone the blue horizon was, naturally
enough, quite weary of her silences and her
long glances which showed that her soul had awakened with throbs
of surprised indignation.
There is something so English in the London homes of the aris-
tocracy. They are often in squares. Taking them all roundt the
aristocrats are more in the square than on the square. (Occasional
puns do enliven a dull book so much.) The dowager was sitting in
the drawing-room wearing Dr. FADD'S Patent Hygienic Clothing',
which I am happy to advertise here. Then Lady DAZE came in,
turning a neat somersault, and they discussed the modern maiden in
violent but elegant language.
BOOK II.
STODGIE STTTPIDSORT was usually in love. Perhaps that is why he
was the greatest booby of all. But he had a sincere affection for his
mother, and once, when she was lost in the snow, he actually offered
to undergo the fatigue of taking off his pumps and putting on thick
boots, so that he could go out to rescue her. But he did not really
mean to do it, and sat comfortably by the fire.
This brave, noble Englishman is the hero of my
story. But you will have to wade through a
great many episodes before you come to his
meeting with the heroine. To fill up the time,
she went to Algiers with her husband and Mr.
HARMMEAN, another male booby. While he was
making love to her, Lord DAZE listened at the
keyhole, who then entered and laid his hand on
the young man's shoulder.
"Allow me to lend you a Bradshaw," he
said.
"What do you mean P" asked his wife.
"I mean that I ought to kick this man out
of the house; but, as he is bigger than I am, I
hint at his departure in this courteous and cautious manner."
She stood up with intense anger, and boxed her husband's ears,
who went to bed crying.
STODOIE STUPIDSORT was very fond of music, and when he heard an
organ playing "'£ diinno where 'e are," he thought it was by
WAGNER. And then at last one evening he met Lady DAZE. As he
was seven foot five she noticed him at once. Soon after he gave her
his photograph, who gave him hers. Then she asked him to her box
at a music-hall, and he understood nothing.
"Oh!" she said, "it gets easier further on."
Then the band struck up " 'E dunno where 'e are," and STODGIE,
flinging his opera-hat in her face, rushed put. Another booby gone.
Just about this time Lord DAZE, finding himself useless in the story,
died suddenly. Yet another booby gone.
BOOK III.
There is really no need for this book except to fill up. I might tell
you all about Prince and Princess THAJOALAHI, and how they screamed,
and behaved generally like Austrian nobles. But it cannot possibly
interest you, so I will merely mention that Lord DAZB carefully
left some poison in his laboratory, which I have just remembereil
opportunely, and that his widow, who must have been covered with
mud after lying for half an hour on the fresh-turned earth in the
churchyard, went back to the tall house. There she turned her last
somersault with all her indolent, unrivalled grace of movement, and
passed through the study into the laboratory beyond, which is the
end. Perhaps she went away into stage-land, and joined the Second
Mrs. Tanqueray and Little Mrs. Lessingham. Who can tell?
Anybody? At all events, not the author. What happened to the
other boobies in this story nobody knows—or cares.
"'AvE A NEW PIECE ? "—They've got it, at The Avenue. A
shawt criticism on it is, "Pshaw! Absurd!"

"CHURCH AND STAGE."
THE Tablet of the week before last, quoting from the Notre Dame
Scholastic, told us how a certain honour called "the Lretare Medal"
had been awarded to Mr. AUGCSTIN DALY, of "Daly's," New York
and London, by the Very Rev. ANDREW MOBKISSEY, President of the
University. It is to be presented to the clever theatrical manager
on his return, "when The Most Rev. Archbishop CORRIGAN will read
the address." Now this is as it should be. In America the Catholic
Clergy, "permissu guperiorum," can visit the theatres, or at least
some theatres, such as ATTJJUSTIN DALY'S, and on these special occa-
sions a Shakspearian play is provided for their entertainment. Mr.
Punch notices that an extra matinee, " under the patronage of H.E.
Cardinal YAUOHAN," at Daly's, is announced for this Wednesday;
but H.E. "Vaughan't be theer" in propria persona, though he
gives his countenance, a decidedly handsome one, to the performance.
Mr. Punch asks why should not this rational form of recreation be
occasionally permitted to the hard-worked, over-taxed, and very
poorly paid Catholic Clergy in London? in Manchester? in Liver-
pool? or in any one of the great industrial centres P The Anglican
Clergy, and the Clergy of all other denominations, are free to go to
the theatres according to their own sweet will—even though the
"Sweet Will" of the occasion in question be not "Sweet WILL
SHAKSPEARE," and many of them are to be seen at the theatres, and
occasionally at the Opera. Let Eminences consider. "All work and
no play " is a dangerous system. The,- go to their work regularly
enough; let 'em occasionally get to a little " play."

COTTON REEL-ISM AT THE ADELPHI.
WHAT mav be the details of the plot of
Mr. SUTTON VANE'S The Cotton King, at the
Adelphi, I confess I did not follow after the
highly satisfactory conclusion of the Seconc
Act, which seemed to me to finish the pluy
At that psychological moment I was perfectly
content to see
Virtue Victori-
ous, and Via
Vanquished! '.
was well aware
that in a pre-
vious scene th
villain had doni
something so
artful with
some property
bank notes—
very " real pro-
perty" these—
that the much-
suffering hero
Jack Charles
Warner Os-
iorn.wasbounc
to be suspected
of having appropriated monies belonging to
the firm of Herbert Fleming, De Fonseca i$-
Co., to his own use; but as at the end oi
the Second Act the villain had been un-
equivocally " cornered," his crimes exposed,
and he himself very nearly killed, and as on
that interesting occasion virtue had been
triumphant and vice nowhere, there was
every opportunity for any little difficulty
with regard to the aforesaid property notes
to have been cleared lip on the spot, had
the author and the villain been so minded, to
the satisfaction of everybody in the play.
But, not a bit of it; no self-respecting melo-
dramatist would dare to deceive a trusting
audience in this manner, and no Adelphi
Manager with his heart in the right place,
which I take to be the Cash-box in the
Theatre Treasury, could possibly so trifle
with the feelings of an audience as to start
an Adelphi drama at eight, and end it by
ten. Perish the thought! So in the Third
Act the villain is seen going about again
just as if nothing had happened, and being
received as a visitor by the woman to whom
he had been (to put it delicately) so un-
pardonably rude, that bruised worm as is
the heroine Hetty prat/son (played sympa-
thetically on the night I was there by Miss
JANET ACHUHCH, in the absence of the
original interesting victim of villainy, Miss
MABION TERRY, who has since reappeared on
the scene), even she might have refused to
receive this villain of the deepest dye (whose
dark black hair and ditto moustache are but
an index to his mind) as a visitor, with even
ordinary politeness,—at least so I should
have thought. But no! With superhuman
charity she apparently lets bygones be by-
gones (his victim, Elsie Kent, "the pet of
the works," who has suffered for the works
of the pet, has, since the end of Act II., been
laid to rest with her mother in an adjacent
churchyard, much to the gentlemanly villain's
satisfaction), and in a pleasant, if perhaps a
slightly distant manner, she accepts his polite
attentions. This atrocious scoundrel, named
Stockley (played by Mr. EDWARD O'NEILL
with as much unconventionality as is per-
missible in a villain at the Adelphi), is still
retained in his responsible position as manager
of the Ashton Cotton Works, as if there had
lever been that one memorable evening when
le was publicly denounced by his victim
lacked up by the heroine, and was then only
laved from the vengeance of his own employes
by the intervention of Jack Osborn!
Then at the end of Act III. comes THE
Sensation Scene, which does " give the drama
a 'lift'" with a vengeance. Down it come;
with crushing effect! and down comes thi
curtain amid the ringing cheers of the hitherto
breathless audience!
Delightful to see the incomparable Colleen
Batcn, Mrs. DION BOUCICAULT, once again on
the scene of her former triumphs, gently re-
presenting the heroine's mother. Miss ALMA
STANLEY, described as " Servant at the Dray-
sons, afterwards a Strong Woman," sings an<
dances, in conjunction with that dry humorist
Mr. ARTHUR WILLLAMS, with great effect
But what a lime " The Draysons" must hav(
had with this handsome singing and dancing
chambermaid!! Very funny, too, is Mr
LENNOX PAWLE as the RererendMr. Ponder
whose rather unecclesiastical conduct makes
the judicious wonder what will be " Pander's
End."
BRUCE SMITH'S scenery is admirable; anc
the stage management, for which Mr
CHARLES HUDSON is responsible, is about as
good as it can be, except in the scene where
the dance and song occur, when the persons
for whose amusement the two principals are
supposed to be performing take uncommonly
little interest in the entertainment, whicr
callousness is perhaps pardonable, seeing thai
the two singing and dancing entertainers so
far ignore their audience (on the stage) as to
turn their backs on them the whole time!!
Altogether, the dramatist new to the
Adelphi shows great skill in designing sensa-
tions, and exhibits a Sutton Vane of humour.

Henceforth my cardigan is shunned—
This heat demands a Cummerbund!
Then out from some secluded spot
Discreetly spread with pepper hot
Shall come my flannels fresh and new—

My hat of straw by summer sunned,
And last—not least—my Cummerbund!

The glories of the golden day
In drifting on the river's tide,
With some fond maiden by my side!—

Will like me in my Cummerbund.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
QUOTH the Baron, who has lately been allowed some
leisure for novel reading, "I must congratulate Miss
BESSIE HATTON on her novel in two volumes, entitled
Enid Lyle, and published by CHAPMAN AND HALL."
Having in his time picked up some little knowledge of the
World, the Convent, and the Stage, the Baron can testify
to the truthful representation of the two latter divisions;
for, though his experience of conventual life is naturally
limited, yet his experience of the stage is by no means
inconsiderable. The clever authoress's scenes in the world
are, here and there, a trifle too melodramatic, and rather
suggestive of a telling situation or two in a Drurylanian
or Adelphian drama, intended to thrill a sensation-loving
audience, than as representing a real situation in ordinary
life where the object is to avoid publicity or anything
savouring of effect.' But the storv is thoroughly interest-
ing from point to point, the lovable characters of the tale
are drawn with a skilful hand guided by a warm heart
and a clear head, and more than once, when the Baron has
paused for a while to consider whether the hero of the
story, Al-ec Meadows, were not sketched from life, has he
murmured to himself meditatively, " 'I know that man,
he comes from' but no, I recommend novel-loving
readers to (ret this book, but I will not give any one of
them this clue: suffice it that the 'missing word' is not
'Sheffield.'" The Baron fancies that the sketch of the stage-
manager—"the staige-manager"—is rather burlesqued.
In a theatre such as this whereof Mr. Alec Meadows is
the proprietor and manager, an unpardonably vulgar'ARRY
as the staige-manager" is scarcely probable. The Baron
does remember such an one, in fact two or three of them,
in what were not "the palmy days," but the " cabbagey
days" of the drama, when stage-managers habitually used
as strong language as did "our army in Flanders," and
when a five-pound note was the payment, or, indeed, the
highest payment, given to a stock-author for " cabbaging"
from the "French. What that "stock-author" was, in
byegone days, may be gathered from ALBERT SMITH'S
Pottle/on Legacy, whence the Baron begs to quote
the following; i.e., a dialogue between Mr. Flitter and
Mr. Shem the manager and proprietor of a theatre:
"There's a charming piece, governor, just out. I saw it
at Paris on Friday. Now, look here—it is sure to make a
tremendous hit; and if you '11 give me a ten-pound note,
[ '11 do it for you off-hand." Then Mr. Shem has a look
at it and hands it back saving, "I had that piece last
week, my boy. I 've got it done already. Mv man Croon
has two guineas a week to do all my interludes—eh?"
Where are the representatives of Mr. Shem nowadays?
You must turn to a certain ZoLA-esque English novelist
called GEORGE MOORK for a portrait of the modern Mr.
Shem of the theatrical world; and when found and made
a note of, his existence will be denied, and My Lady
BETSY PRIO will boldly say to Mrs. GAMP, the authoress,
who may have ventured on the theatrical portrait in ques-
tion, "1 don't believe there 's no sich a person!" Now
the Baron and the Baron's friends do believe that there is
such a person as the theatrical manager and actor Alec
Meadows so excellently portrayed by Miss BESSIE HATTON;
and, moreover, that just now he is not by any means an
~~ exception to the rule.
Likewise the Baron most cordially welcomes a very excellent
little volume, charmingly bound, "And bound," quoth the Baron,
"so as to deceive even the elect," entitled Memoires Inedits,
gathered together by one Maitre WALTER H. POLLOCK, and dedicated
to Mr. GRAHAM MTJKRAY. The Memoires Inedits concern a certain
"Monsieur le Marquis de ," whose name remains a secret, being
writ, as is the little book, with a dash. And what more expres-
sive? for, as the Marquis lived dashingly, so died he with a dash, and
all that was left for the tombstone memorialist to do was on his
headstone to " cut a dash." The Marquis is delightful. Enter his
valet Francois:—
"Monsieur le Marquis a sonne 1"
[There are some misprinted accents, by the way, which will be
corrected in the next edition. For example, "a*1 is in my copy
printed " a." For a less matter a compositor has been shot; or, if
not shot, at least, like a gun, discharged.]
"Out" replies the Marquis, "presque rten. II me sembh que
Monsieur de Sarrazere n'aime pas mon tin de Bourgpgne. Coupe-
la gorge a Monsieur de Sarrazere. Aussitot dit, aussitot fait."
Let me commend this little gem to all readers who trust the wore
of their friend and literary guardian,
M. LE BABON DE BOUQUINAUX.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROJI THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, April 16.—Appearance of House
recalls historic nights when Mr. G. has had a big Budget in hand.
Not a vacant seat anywhere; no passage up the gangways, on
which late-comers camp out like pittites waiting to storm the
Lyceum on the night when ELLEN and HENRY came sailing home
from Ameriky. Both side galleries full. Camp-stools eke out
scanty accommodation for private secretaries and Treasury authori-
ties under gallery. Strangers' galleries packed; the rarely-used
seats behind SPEAKER'S chair keenly competed for.
The SQUIRE OF MALWOOD spoke for over two hours and a half,
with that air of chastened resignation he has assumed with his new
office of Leader. No more quips and cranks, nor any further setting
of the table in a roar. Like all reformed sinners, the SQUIRE is
even savagely resentful of people who would make merry in a world
like this. Once when a Member opposite, oppressed by the sur-
rounding gloom, broke into something suspiciously like a hysterical
laugh, the SQUIRE turned upon him a visage of such awesome
reproof that a smiling countenance was abruptly suffused _by a dull,
stolid stare, put on with obvious intent to convey impression that it
wasn't he who had laughed. Amongst Peers in gallery over the
clock was a Bishop. The Member for SARK tells me the right
reverend gentleman confided to him that when the SQUIRE concluded
his address, it was with the greatest difficulty he restrained himself
from rising, giving out the Doxology, and inviting congregation to
join in its familiar strains. But I aon't believe SARK is on speaking
terms with a Bishop.
CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER shares with the VICE-CHAM-
BERLAIN and the CONTROLLER OF THE HOUSEHOLD the distinction of
having a special dress pertaining to his ministerial office. It is a
stately gown, of rich black silk. Remember seeing Mr. G. arrayed
in it at the opening of the new Law Courts. Never in any public
appearance did he look so well. Why should CHANCELLOR OF EX-
CHEQUER forego advantage of wearing this gown when expounding

"The Doctor (MnG r) Rampant, or Scotland
for the Scotch."
his Budget in House of Commons? It would to-night have ad-
mirably suited the SQUIRE and his almost monastic manner of
announcing the addition of a penny to the income-tax. His intro-
duction of the death duties to the notice of the House was artis-
tically funereal. As PRINCK ARTHUR said, talking it over after-
wards, "you might almost hear across the hushed House the boom
of St. Paul's, the sound of muffled drum, or the sadly throbbing
recurrence of the minute gun."
Quite so. But there remains the fact, agreed upon on both sides,
that in a speech that was a model of lucidity, the SQUIRE presented
to the House a boldly conceived scheme, broad-based upon an econo-
mically sound foundation. Business done.—Budget Bill brought in.
Tuesday.—'' This is Bannockburn over again," said THE MACO REOOR,
surveying the embattled hosts from the heights behind the Treasury
Bench. "PRINCE
ARTHUR, of course,
stands for EDWARD
THE SECOND; CAW-
MEL-BANNERMAN is
the BRUCE. Don't
know how to fix
JOSEPH," he con-
tinued, glancing re-
flectively across the
Gangway. "There
wasn't any one
exactly like him in
the early years of
the Fourteenth
Century."
This, of course,
is poesy. Plain
parliamentary fact
is that House is
again engaged in
struggle round pro-
posal to create
Scotch Grand Com-
mittee. Ministers
say it is a mere
nothing, designed
simply to expedite business. Under this muffler the Opposition spy
the _peard of Home Rule. Difficult to work up excitement round the
subject even when thus presented. JOKIM labours hard, but his
blows resound through empty House. CAWMEL-BANNEHMAN strictly
Scotch in his manner of dealing with the question. JOSEPH, saying
himself up for the after-dinner hour, more successful, especially
when prodding at his old friend and Round-Table colleague TRE-
VELYAN. J. a person of few prejudices. But he doesn't seem to
like TREVELYAN. PRINCE ARTHUR lolls disconsolately on the Front
Bench, occasionally interposing to demand another Minister.
This thirst for eloquence from Treasury Bench been the peculiarity
of the long Debate. On second night, GEOROIE HAMILTON hotly
moved Adjournment, because no Minister had immediately followed
EDWARDCLABKE. Since then the SQUIRE and PRINCE ARTHUR have sat
and watched each other across the table. Whenever the PRINCE has
shown disposition to rise, the SQUIRE has hastily thrown in another
Minister; upon which PRINCE ARTHUR subsided; Debate went
forward for another hour or so; fresh signs of restlessness, and pop
goes another Minister.
Began even before Orders of Day reached. "Is the right hon.
gentleman aware," said PRINCE ARTHUR, fixing the guilty Leader
of House with glittering eye, "that no Cabinet Minister has yet
replied on the particular Amendment to the Motion for the Scotch
Grand Committee now before the House?"
"We will place a Cabinet Minister at the disposal of the right
hon. gentleman at an early hour," said the SQUIRE, affecting levity,
though he felt it not.
"Reminds me," said PI.UNR-KT, "of story that used to thrill my
voung marrow when I was in the nursery. All about a father of a
family driving in sledge over steppes of Russia, white with the
harvest of snow. The wolves come out; father of family touches
up horses; wolves gain on him; happy thought; throw out a child;
wolves stopping to devour infant, the affectionate but perturbed
father gets a start; wolves come up again; out goes another child,
plumper than the last; wolves a little longer over the meal, but
once more gain on sledge. Forget how many children there were to
start with, but remember the anguished father got safely to his
home in Smolensk!, and received the sympathy of Tiis friends on his
successive bereavements. Suppose the &QUIRE will pull through.
But he's already chucked out TREVELYAN, the LORD ADVOCATE,
CAWMEL-BANNERMAN, and the Solicitor-General for Scotland.
Supply must be getting short, and our pack is still in full cry."
Business done.—Battle of Bannockburn still going on.
Irish tenant and landlord. JOHN MORLEY brings in Bill dealin
with case of evicted tenants. PRINCE ARTHUR criticises proposal
Then follow HARRINGTON, T. W. RUSSELL, JOHN DILLON, RED-
MOND, SATTNDERSON, and the CURSORY CARSON, himself a compara-
tively late-comer on the scene. Curious how at touch of the old
topic the old manner asserts itself. JOHN MORLEY, as usual,
practical, earnest, really thinking of the interests of the persons,
tenants and landlords, concerned in his Bill. PRINCE ARTHUR reaches
fuller development of the high tone of statesmanship, as opposed to
partisan implacability, which more than once since new Session
opened has delighted the House.
Then HARRINGTON steps in, and the fair picture is smirched.
With one eye on the hapless peasantry, the other on his parted
friends seated below, he loudly declares that he and the patriot band
of which he is the ninth part will have nothing to do with this effort
to ameliorate the condition of the ruined, starving victims of a
political campaign. Don't let them think that, because they 're
hungry, Parnelhtes are to be intimidated into, even temporarily,
withdrawing from the vendetta commenced in Committee Room
No. 15. It's a case of "Pull, REDMOND '. Pull, SEXTON!" as SARK
observes, and, when the tussle is over, there is not likely to be
much of the emaciated tenant left.

from the Treasury Bench, the hectoring HANBURY got up a controversy
on the subject of his professional emoluments, more than hinting that,
:or the sake of filthy lucre, he had broken an honourable under-
standing. Sir CHARLES'S patience under the trial was supernatu-
rally benignant. LOCKWOOD, who has met him elsewhere, sat
amazed, while tears stood in eyes of BOB REID at this fresh testi-
mony, which he is always ready to welcome, of the innate goodness
of man.
For fourteen years, through troublesome times, RUSSELL has sat
n the Commons, working his way from below Gangway to Treasury
[Jench. He has taken a prominent part in the fiercest controversy
that has raged at Westminster since Corn Law times. The strife
has parted friends, and riven families. But on neither side has this
foremost champion of Home Rule made a single personal enemy,
nor is there in any quarter variation from the regret felt that the
House of Commons is poorer by the withdrawal from its ranks of
one who in all his Parliamentary relations has preserved the tradi-
tions of the chivalrous Irish nature, and in his contributions to debate
has maintained the highest standard of a gifted race.

["* * * The Duchess of TECK and the Duchess of SUTHERLAND arranged

"Daily Naet," April 23.]
ON Monday, the 23rd ult., the Duchess of TECK and the Duchess of
SUTHERLAND ar-
ranged a meeting in
order to settle certain
points in connection
with the exhibition of
"English Silks" to
be held at Stafford
House on May 8. We
give a fine specimen
of an English Silk in
the accompanying
picture, which is from
a fine drawing by
WOODBLOCK, Q.C..
one of our; best Legal
Draughtsmen. The
first objection to the
show came from a dis-
tinguished Leader
who "objected," he
said, "to an exhibi-
tion of ' Silks' taking
place at Stafford
House!" The objec-
tion was overruled by
the Duchess of TECK,
who observed that all
the wisdom of the Bar
was in the Silks, while
the others could only
be considered as
"Stuff and Xon-
sense." After some
discussion, Mr. BRIEF-
LESS rose to address
the Chair, which hap-
pened at the moment
to be vacant, as within
two minutes were all the other seats. Mr. BRIEFLESS then pro-
posed a vote of thanks, which was carried nem.con., and he then
broke himself up and left.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
"I HAVE just read," writes one of the Assistant Readers to his
adored chief, "one of the best stories of adventure, intrigue, hand-
to-hand fighting, and hair-breadth 'scapes that it has been my good
fortune to come across for many a long year. It is called The
Prisoner of Zenda, is written by ANTHCJST HOPE, and is published
by ARBOWSMITH. It is in one volume, and I read it, so to speak, at
one gulp. Imagine the younger brother of a respectable British
Earl suddenly transformed by the most wonderful, but artfully
possible, concatenation of circumstances into the ruling sovereign of
a great Continental monarchy. Imagine !him fighting like a paladin
for the very king whose character and crown he has been forced to
assume, winning the love of the beautiful girl whom that king is to
marry, storming fortified castles, swimming deep moats, plunging
his sword into scoundrels, and behaving altogether as if he had
never known civilisation, top-hats, and woollen under-clothing.
I daresay there are faults in the book. All I know is, they didn't
trouble me, as I abandoned myself to the dash and galloping excite-
ment of this rattling story."
"Mr. BARING GOULD," quoth the Baron, discussing The Queen of
Lore with one of the Assistant Readers, "has gradually become
one of my favourite authors. You soon begin to know his
'tricks and his manners,' and when he tikes the greatest possible
pains to describe some ugly piece of ground, smooth above but
rotten beneath, you know what is in store for the villain or the
troublesome personages in the novel. So when he tells you of the
salt works and the burning brine, and how no one ever comes out
alive after a few seconds' pickling, the novel-student may bet his
bottom dollar that it will be all up with one at least of the bad cha-
racters in that story. He chooses several very odd names for his
dramatis persona, chooses them defiantly; because just imagine
any knowing-hand at novel-reading being seriously interested in
parties of the name of ' BUTTON !'" "Burro**," quoth the Assistant,
diffidently, "ought to be the name of a man who keeps a^stud-
farm." The Baron frowned. The Assistant humbly apologised, and
TOT., on.
order being restored, the Baron resumed. "Yet interested you do
become, and, having once commenced reading the pretty and
occasionally Adelphian sensational story of The Queen of Love,
you cannot put it down until you have finished it. In perusing
such a novel the office of ' Skipper' is not a sinecure. But, to skip
well and wisely is an art. Heartily," quoth the Baron, "do I
recommend The Queen of Lore to those who ask me ' What shall we
read, pour nous distraire?'" THE BARON DE B.-W. & Co.
TIVOLIMUS!
"TIVOUHUS!" Hie we to Tivoli. the Tivoli on the banks of the
yellow Thames, that is, the Tivoli Music Hall in the Strand, where
there is about as good a specimen of the Variety Show as is to be met
with anywhere in London. Good. We are here, at the Tivoli. To
us appeareth, on the stage, a certain artistic VESTA VICTORIA dis-
guised as a kind of "Good-for-nothing" Nan, proving herself,
however, good for a great deal. Then carolled forth HARRY FREEMAN
a song whereof the burden was " Why do I smile '? " which question
he answered to the satisfaction of the audience, who certainly were
not puzzled to know why they laughed. GEORGE BEAUCH.*MP, whose
name suggests a poppillar remedy, sang " / ran't change it" capitally,
and DAN LF.NO was irresistibly funny with his own peculiar kind of
eccentric discourse (to which the verses of his song are as the propor-
tion of Falstaff's pennyworth of bread to the intolerable quantity of
sack, only that this is anything but "intolerable," on the contrary,
it is most excellent fooling), keeping the audience in a roar from first
to last, when they recall him and ask for more.
Of the Brothers GRIFFITHS, with their lion in a cage, we only heard,
for they did not appear, but instead came a one MORRIS CRONIN,
neatly attired in white flannel boating suit, doing marvellous feats
with Dottles and clubs, and performing his varied feats with rare
grace and without any apparent effort.

mother might very properly have licked kitten for licking milk;
poetical justice—the liquor licked. See no sense in present arrange-
ment. No. 35 is " The Taxidermist." But why taxidermist? Am
I a paphydermist that I cannot see the reason? Have known many
men sit in easy-chair with legs on mantelpiece and not a taxidermist
among the lot. Give it up, unless it is misprint for The MACDEBMOTT,
and bad portrait at that.
Underneath a charming little chip of wood by Mr. R. E. FBY

Clad rather stingily,

Pomntcs (pa» de terre).
Find myself involuntarily running to the French for unearthly
apples. Artist himself gives lucid explanation of picture in verse on
scroll. If my memory serves me, something like the following:—
"It 's tart, she said, this pippin,
Just where I've been and bit it;
Its taste is nice, but nippin';
I think 1 'd better quit it."
Feel acutely for her when I think of pathos of Casino-song,
"Elle a mange trop de melon."
Passing by Charley's Aunt (No. 42), which is as good as a
play, we reach No. 47 (" Night Trawlers "). Recall poet's words,
"Ihe moon may draw the sea." Think this is just the way a blue
noon would draw it. Must, however, give word of honest praise to
Mr. LINDNER'S sea-pieces (this and No. 87 and No. 105). All three
could tell some home-truths to Mr. STEEB'S " Marines," and do them
food. Notice that some pictures have a red stamp in corner to show
;heir sale is over; these Trawlers in No. 47 have little highly-
coloured wafers stuck all over them; conclude their sail must be
over too. No. 50 is what Mr. STOTT (not of Oldhain) calls " In the
Moonlight." Should myself have called it fairly broad—not of
she dared to do such a thing, she actually
said that she couldn't see where the harm came in, and that she
didn't see what else she was to do. No! Let woman stick to her own
sphere—the common round, the daily task—and there will be no
more of this bother about men not having room to smoke, or not
caring to because ladies are present. I enclose my card, and am,
Yours, only an old-fashioned Woman,
A MAYFAIB MOTHEB.
DEAB MB.P.,—One gentleman has very kindly consented to disclose
the real reason why he, at any rate, always goes into a smoking-car-
riage—to escape the women's " prattle" which goes on in the other
carriages! Poor thing ! he only finds he's jumped out of the frying-
pan into the fire, for even in the smokers he finds women who dare to
talk and disturb his highness. Really, we 're very sorry. If we'd
only known we would liave cut out our tongues rather than have
driven away this sensitive creature to despair and a smoking com-
partment. I can fancy him saying:—
"0! hang this noisy womankind,
Her prattle me displeases.
She only does it to annoy,
Because she knows it teases."
I think the best plan will be for us not to travel by train at all.
we are in a smokine-carria^e we 're in the wav: if we 're not. we
If
we are in a smoking-carriage we 're in the way; if we 're not, we've
too much to say. Lest this habit of rhyme should grow chronic, let
me hasten to subscribe myself, dear Mr. Punch,
Your devoted admirer, ETHEL TBAVEBS.
P.S.—I 'm sure you would never be rude enough to say I prattled
too much.—E. T.
DEA.R SIR,—This correspondence must not end as it began,—in
smoke. Something practical must be done. It's clear to my mind
that an ordinary train is not large enough to hold both man and
woman. Now, it's certain that man must go by train. How would
the "somethings" in the City ever get there else? If this is so, it
seems equally certain that woman must consent not to travel by
train. Every woman would, I think, have a claim upon her husband
to provide her with a carriage and pair, but that could, no doubt, be
arranged. It will be a glorious day when the Male Train becomes a
reality, instead of a Post-Office fiction. Yours suggestively,
OjfE WHO LIKES TO TRAVEL IN A TBAIN
OF HAPPY THOUGHTS.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.
PRIMEVAL BOY.
A HOLIDAY STUDY, BY A SCIENTIFIC PARENT.
IF novelty cannot be claimed for Boy as a subject for the essayist
or the philosopher, the purely scientific aspect of the race has
hitherto been strangely overlooked. This is the more remarkable,
for boys are indubitably a far more interesting survival than any of
the belated fauna or flora of the antipodes. The antiquity of boys
should alone be enough to commend them to the scientific heart of
an age devoted to the study of Origins. There have certainly been
boys for close upon six thousand years, if we only accept literally the j
chronology which is taught to the genus under the heading—in their |
school reports —of "Divinity." But,
taking the wider floor of speculative ."^
science, the hearth and home of the
chuntering Cave-man must have been
rendered hotter and less homely by the
irrepressible and irresponsible Cave-boy at
some wholly indefinable distance of tune.
This venerable relic of primeval ages we
have continually with us, in apparently
inexhaustible profusion; and that not in
a mummified state, or fossilised, like
Time's monuments to its own victims;
not in a fragmentary condition from which
science can only hesitatingly reconstruct
the broken image; but living and energising
and thinking as it has lived and energised
and thought since the original boy first
played Robinson Crusoe in the lagoons of
a vanished continent.
As far back as tradition and legend go,
we find change continually affecting the
moral, mental, and physical condition of
adult man. But wherever found in his-
tory or legend, in folk-lore or myth, the
small boy maintains an unimpaired iden-
tity. He alone is independent of secular
circumstance, from Dr. GRIMSTONE to
ORBILIUS, back to the academies of
Babylon and the choir schools of Stone-
henge, and so into the forgotten dark-
nesses of time, where Induction alone can
penetrate, guided like a glow-worm by
the light of her internal consciousness.
There is nothing in common, save mere
common humanity, between the pale
scholar of the PARKS and the ancient Assyrian scribe, whose
records he laboriously deciphers. But between the pale scholar's sons
(who have been marring his work by their trampling and shouting
overhead, and, banished to the back garden, shall shortly let you
off a home-made petard) and the sons of the long-forgotten
Assyrian, there is an absolute identity of manner, custom, aim,
and view. To times where even tradition reaches not, Induction
guides us with unerring foot, and we find the Cave-boy, not like his
father, a rude, rough-hewn image of the man that is to be, an unread
proof of an article that the ages shall revise, but factus ad ttnguem
(hand dubie immundani) tit to take his place, if caught young enough
to accustom him to jacket and trousers, alongside of JONES Minor in
the class-room; to mix, a welcome and ready-made companion with
JONES Minor and his young friends in the playground, the tuck-
shop, or the secluded Campus Martins of single-combat. Fit, except
for one thing. He would physically have an immense, and from the
boy's point of view, an unfair advantage, for there can be no doubt
whatever that the head of Primeval Boy was of stone, presumably
one of the less ornamental kinds of granite. The reasoning which
leads to this conclusion is at once interesting and irrefragable.
Seeing that everything points to the identity of the Boy nature,
semper et ubique, while man's nature, bad enough now, has, demqn-
strably, become much mollified, it follows that the Cave-boys, with
the nature of the contemporary boy, and only an equal physical
equipment, must have perished very early indeed in the history of
the race. They would either have been killed off by justly exas-
perated parents during the holidays; by masters, workmen, and
gamekeepers, during term-time; or they must have sought safety
in flight to the most inaccessible fastnesses.
But this latter seems to be an untenable position. We are well
aware of the extraordinary hardiness and the even more extraordinary
impunity of Boys. They defy the laws of physiology, even of gravi-
tation, at what is supposed to be a tender age. The adult athlete
would perish miserably from half the deleterious dainties consumed
in a given time by a quite negligeable fourth-form boy. The wet-
tings, the chills, the tumbles of any winter half-holiday, of any
spring bird-nesting foray, would infallibly slay, or hopelessly wreck,
the paladins whose exploits the boys mimetically emulate. It is not

on physical grounds, then, that this theory must be rejected, for at the
risk of incurring the charge of extravagance it must be claimed for
the Cave-boy that he was even hardier and more audacious than his
descendants at the present day. No! The grounds for rejecting
the flight-theory are, that if released from an authority against
which to rebel, from the joy and the risk of exasperating his adult
congeners, the whole significance of the Boy disposition would be
lost, and Nature we know makes nothing in vain.
No, Primeval Boy must have remained at home. And this being
so, he must certainly have possessed a singularly indurated cranium.
The only material that would have resisted the fury of Cave-parents
would be stone, for iron was at that period unknown. Another abso-
lutely conclusive proof that the Primeval Boy had a stone head is
the prevalence of stone weapons and uten-
sils. The untutored Cave-man would
never have hit upon the idea of stone im-
plements unless he had physically hit
upon stone first, and even the rudest
Cave-dweller would not have gone
about banging his knuckles deliberately
upon hard substances in a mere spirit
of utilitarian research. No — passion
sways uncultured man. And in some
transport, smiting his unruly or im-
pertinent offspring on the head, he learnt
by experience the first lesson of civilisa-
tion, the need, the use, and the construc-
tion of tools; and, secondarily, the virtue
of discretion in the infliction of corporal
chastisement. Boy was thus the first
great educational motor • and man,
having stolen his thunder, has been pay-
ing him back with interest ever since.
The study of Primeval Boy seems to be
leading to an even more astounding con-
clusion than that all civilisation is
primarily due to his head, if not exactly
to his brain. And that is nothing less
than that the human race sprung origi-
nally neither from a monkey nor a marine
ascidian, but from the stone-headed boy,
I whose parents were a debased form of the
higher type. As his educational influence
grew upon his elders, there became by
- Degrees less need for the stone head, or
., /,' f°r tne bronze shins of a later period, and
•///, ••• •' /'','";/+ /• so in time the wooden head was evolved,
which is even now not seldom met with.
WORDSWORTH, with the accidental inspiration of poetical genius,
anticipated this latest discovery in the line, "The Child is Father to
the Man," and science, by the study of Primeval Boy, gracefully
accepts and confirms the suggestion of the lake-dwelling poet.

also a perfect egg,—quite fresh, of course,—for £000. Mr. WARD is
a man of great awk-toritas, and what he has given so large a sum

bargain for this his recent purchase will have an awk-ward customer

For playing upside down with Holy Writ;
'Sell all thou hast and give it to the poor,'
Take all they have and give it to thyself;
Then, after we have eased them of their coin,
It is our forest custom they should revel
Along with ROBIN."
Robin Hood in Tennyson's "Foreileri."
WHEN limes beene greene, and laylocks

Quoth ROBIN, "and goe your wayes.

And when he came to the merry greenwood,
Hold ROBIN was aware
Of a Merchaunte rich, who forth y-rode
All on a palfrey fayre.
"Stand you still!" quoth bold RODIN HOOD,
"Under this tree so greene;
And hande me straighte that bagge of golde
Whiche neath your cloke is aeene I"
"Thou art a madman," the Merchaunte said.
"Woldest take my all for fee?
Seeing thy asking hath beene soe bad,
Well granted it shale not be."
Then ROBIN bent up his long bende-bowe,
And fettled him for to shoote;
And the Merchaunte dragged forth a bagge
of golde,
Shaking from head to foote.
"Woe worth thee, woe worth thee, thou

The charms that Nature lacks.

And folly finds some business still
For popinjays to do!

'Tis the Place, and in the distance I have heard the curfew call
When the wind blows up from Oxford clean and clear to Cumnor

Where the Scholar-Gipsy learned to practise his abandoned tricks.
All about the show I 've wandered, nourishing the quite sublime
Fancy that the Dudley Chamber knew a tale of deadly crime.
And I said, "My airy AMY, state the naked facts to me;
Are you still the great attraction that a ghost is bound to be?"
Far along the woodland whisper of the eerie eventide
Stole the creepy rumour—"Hush thee, hush! Here comes the

O'er my pallid cheek and chilly came a perspirative glow,
And the hair upon my forehead lifted freely from below.

Where is comfort? Ask another! Lines indeed are deuced hard,

"THE PLAY '8 THE—RING."
DEAR MB. PUNCH,—The production of Gentleman Jack at Drury
Lane, in which a distinguished member of the prize-ring takes a
leading part, has suggested to me the reflection that in future our
dramatic critics should not only be well-read men of letters, but also
students of sporting literature. The reception with which the piece
has been met points to the possibility oi other plays of a similar
character occupying the boards; or, to use a more appropriate phrase,
"taking the field in front of the green curtain." If this comes to pass,
surely the first-night critic
fhould be able to describe a
"little mill," or "a quarter
of an hour inside the ropes,"
in language that will be com-
prehended by the common (or

that it could be done, I en-
close a notice of Hamlet as it
might be reported in "the
new reviewing."
THE LIGHT-WEIGHT PRINCE
v. THE HEAVY KING.
(By Our Special Commissioner.)
Last night this interesting
little affair was seen through
by a large company of the
knowing community from all
points of the compass. The
first part of the performance
did not attract much atten-
tion, as all were in waiting
for the last act, in which Ham-
let was matched against
Claudia*, with Laertes (as the
gentlemen of the long robe
would say) intervening. The
plot of the play is simple
enough, and is construct* d
mainly with a view to leading
up to the item in the last act.
Claudius gets rid of his nephew and seizes his throne. Hamlet goes
to England and there picks up the noble art of self-defence. On
his return the Prince goes for the King, and the match comes off in
the final scene. This was specially arranged last night to meet the
requirements of the amended text and stage business. Stakes were
pitched and a ring was made in accordance with the Queensberry
Rules. Then, after the preliminaries had been settled by Osric, who
acted as stakeholder, the principals got to their work with a good

deal of smartness, and plavgoers will notice that the business of the
action has been specially altered to meet modern requirements.
HOUND I.—Hamlet and Laertes having shaken hands, got to work
with great zeal. After a little sword play they dropped their
weapons and took to their fists. Hamlet was the first to get in upon
Laertes' dexter ogle, with good effect. After a little nipping on
both sides, Hamlet caught Laertes a nice upper-out, and sent his man
to the grass with great spirit. First knock-down blow to Hamlet.
ROUND II.—Laertes came up smiling, but, before he could do any-
thing, Hamlet shot out his left, and landed with smart effect on his
opponent's jaw. First blood
for Hamlet.
ROUND III. AND LAST.—
Laertes came up very groggy,
hut apparently ready to take
his punishment like a man.
He promenaded the ring, fol-
lowed by Hamlet, who never
lost an opportunity of landing
a little one on his opponent's
dexter ogle. Each of these
attentions told its tale,, and
before the men had been at
their merry work for five
minutes, Laertes had his ogles
both closed up, and his smeller
in a state of liquidation. It
was at this point that Laerles
called out that Claudius had
"sold the match." Upon this
Hamlet turned his- attention
to the unfortunate king, and
shooting out with his left,
gave him half-a-dozen in
swift succession just under
1he right ear. Ibis caused
Claudius to seek the earth,
and Polonius very properly
threw up the sponge. At this
moment both Hamlet and
J.aertes were prostrate, and
both were deaf to all inquiries
about time. Under the cir-
cumstances, O«riVwill keep the stakes until the referee decides which
of the personal representatives of the deceased shall have them.
Now, Mr. Punch, this is merely a rough idea; but if it were
properly worked up, I have no doubt that a report of this kind
would be fully as interesting as the description of a professional
prize-fight. 1 have shown the will, and others must find the way.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBT, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, April 23.—NOLAN been threatening
to burst all night; popping about on his seat like parched pea;
whenever Member in possession of Committee resumed his seat, the
Colonel on his legs; rapped out sentence or two btfore he discovered
Chairman had called on someone else. In this way, surmising the
sentences to be consecutive (a bold assumption), and taking into
account the rapidity of the Colonel's utterance, he had between
eight and half-past ten, at which hour he got his innings, delivered
a speech of average length.
'This habit of adding to the whisky duty sixpence by sixpence,"
he said, when his chance came. "is becoming fearful."
SQUIRE OF MALWOOD moved uneasily in his seat, as the Colonel
fixed him with glowering eye. Had been pitched into all through
the sitting; JOKIH had criticised his Budget; PRINCE ARTHUR had
almost viciously attacked him because, instead of being abashed, he
had joked at JOKIM. Just before eight o'clock, having been in close
attendance for three hours and a half, having answered many
questions, having made two elaborate speeches, thought he might go
eat a sardine, swallow a cup of bouillon, and hurry back. Tne
blameless BARTLET, rising to continue discussion, Members with one
accord trooped out to dinner.
"Now 's my time," said the SQUIRE to himself. Cautiously
rising, he walked on tiptoe towards the SPEAKER'S chair. Looked as
if he were merely passing in that direction to speak to one of
clerks at table. BABTLET watched him till his figure almost dis-
appeared behind SPEAKER'S chair. There was no doubt the
CHANCELLOR or THE EXCHEQUER was actually leaving the House
when GEORGE CHRISTOPHER TROUT BARTLET, one of the founders
of the National Penny Bank (Limited), was about to offer counsel
and criticism on national finance! This too much for human nature.
"Even the TROUT will turn," as GEORGE CUBZON, looking up for
moment from study of his pocket Koran, observed.
BARTLEY. bituminous now rather than blameless, snapped out re-
mark that the right hon. gentleman is, as usual, leaving the House."
This too much for the most placable of ttmpers. The SQUIRE, hungry,
harassed, returned in three strides, and aimd general cheering badly
battered BABTLEY. • . •
"I have never," BARTLEY whimpered, "been discourteous to the
right hon. gentleman."
"I never thought it worth while to attack you," said the SQUIRE,
grimly.
The" SQUIRE had had his hasty dinner when NOLAN returned to the
attack. Therefore the betttr able to bear things. Listened with
pleased attention as the Culonel, firing off sentences like charges from
a Maxim gun, showed how drunkenness is all a question of latitude,
and how the Scotch drink more because they dwell farther north.

Came in for the Horncastle Division of Lincolnshire on death of poor
EDWARD STANHOPE. Like all sensible men DE EBES-IIY disposed to
serve at least one Session before making his maiden speech. Would
have done it only for the family ghost.
"SuppoFe, Tony," he said, just before he caught the Chairman's
eye, "there isn't a ghost in your family? If you can manage it keep
them out. Nothing more overbearing or inconvenient. Wasn't it a
cabman who described JOHN FOSTER as ' a harbitery gent'? FOSTER
wasn't in it with our ghost. Ghosts worse to live with now than they
used to be. Read the penny papers. Ours up in the Budget. Ever
since the SQUIRE brought it in given me no rest; insists on knowing
whether succession duty will have to be paid upon it; if so at what
scale. Quest ion sounds commonplace enough seated here in the smoking-
room. But put in dead of night, in hollow tones, with the distinct
smell of graveclothes filling the room, it's no joke. Tried to get the

After dinner DE ERESBY pulled himself together and trotted out

A VOICE FROM THE BAR.
(To the Editor of Punch.)
SIR,—I notice that attention has been called in an evening paper
to a recent decision of the Czar of RUSSIA in the case of a doctor at
St. Petersburg. According to the St. James's Gazette, an all-round
family practitioner, having treated one of his patients unskilfully,
was sentenced to seven days' imprisonment, fined a thousand roubles,
and ordered to pay the injured lady three hundred roubles a year for
life. This seems strange to us in England; still, I can imagine a
case in which such a punishment would be appropriate in our own
free land. I will imagine an example.
Let us say that a solicitor is in the position of the doctor, and a
client has proved his case against him up to the hilt. I will imagine
that an occupant of the Bench is giving judgment. Let us say
SNOOKS, J.
"I have no hesitation in declaring," says SNOOKS, J., impressively,
"that there has been a serious miscarriage of justice in this case.
This is a suit for administration, and a matter of great importance
has come before a Chief Clerk in Chambers. Now if ever there
was reason for counsel to be briefed here was a convincing
argument. It is true that matters before the Chief Clerks are
argued, and efficiently argued, by juniors who are more acccus-
tomed to writing addresses on envelopes than dealing with ab-
struse points of law. But this was not such a case. It was
distinctly a matter for counsel. And I think that the solicitor
before me—who it must be remembered is an officer of the
Court—has been guilty of great neglect; neglect that almost
amounts to criminal neglect. Under these circumstances I can only
order him to pay all the costs in the action, return the sum lost to
his neglected client, and furnish Mr. BRIEFLESS with suitable causes
for the natural term of his life."
This, Sir, I feel would be a worthy adaptation of the Russian Law
to the requirements of our country, and, as such, I beg to propose it
for acceptance to those who have the framing of
of Court.

No. I.—FROM THE HON. VICTOR MAYDEW, WHITE'S CLUB,
LAD? MABEL HUKTEK, PENTLASD HALL, HANTS.
TO
DEAR LADY MABEL, December 2,189—.
I can't tell you how vexed and disappointed I am at not being
able to come to Pentland on the 14th, but
I am engaged to the BLAGDENS, and
though I scarcely look forward very keenly
to the visit, I don't quite see how I am to
slip out. Had it only been in the follow-
ing week, or indeed in any other week—
but after all I 've no right to worry you
with my might-have-beens. I suppose
we all get the engagements we deserve,
and miss those that we don't deserve, and
I "m not ambitious enough to try to be an
exception to a rule of life which I heard
you lay down when we last met. Still, I
am sure you won't mind my telling you
how immensely I always enjoy a visit to
Pentland. Dear old HAHBY was about
the best friend I ever had, the best, I
think, I can ever hope to have. When
you married him yon told me that nothing
would be changed at Pentland; there
would only be two friends for me there
instead of one—and so it was. Good
Heavens, why [must destiny strike so
blindly and cut down the best and the
noblest when so many, of whom the
highest that can be said is that they are
useless, almost invite the blow that never
falls? No doubt that is all very trite,
and has been said much better by others
ever so many times, but I don't think we
ever know how true most truisms are until
some crash of our own brings them home
to ns; and even after four years—but what
a, brute I am to renew your sorrow or to
mention my feelings at such a loss to you.
London is fairly full, though the weather
has been simply abominable. My brother
HAROLD turned up the other day from four
years of knocking about in all the most
outlandish places in the world, and he
has been dragging me from one place of
amusement to another without remorse.
I 've seen some very bad acting, heard
some very poor singing, have laughed,
though upon my word I scarcely know
why, at two or three shockingly tedious burlesques, have dined at
three or four restaurants, at all of which one seems to come across
the same waiters offering the same dishes (the Supreme* of this that
or the other, the something else en Casserole, and the inevitable
Mousse or Same Blanche), and all calmly expecting the same
exorbitant tip for such slight services as handing one another man's
hat, or calling a four-wheeler when one has requested a hansom.
But HAROLD has come back to it all as fresh as if he had only just
left school instead of being a grown man of twenty-eight with two
wounds and four mentions in despatches.
"Handing one anotLcr mini's hat."
The MAXWELLS dined and went to the play with us yesterday. He
isn't a bad fellow, though he has a kind of lower-middle- Aldershot sort
of mind—the kind of man who tells you a dull story with all its dread-
ful details and all his own tedious corrections of slips that don't matter
in the least. He always introduces it as "the funniest thing, 'pon
my word, I ever heard (or saw) in my life. By Jove, thought I should
ha' died o' laughing!" When I hear that I know what to expect, and
I try in vain to withdraw him from his hideous purpose, but he's got
the horrible pertinacity of a wounded
rhinoceros. Curious that that kind of
dulness doesn't seem to strike women as
really dull, whereas it exanimates men.
MAXWELL has an undeniable cavolry-
moustached popularity with most women.
They humour him, and laugh at his
obvious remarks, and listen patiently to
him, and seem to take an unvarying
pleasure in his society. But I have noticed
that no woman can be with him even for
one evening without getting it into her
little head that Sandown and Kerapton
and Hurlingham are the be-all and end-
all of existence, and that if you don't
know the name and history and odds of
the Derby favourite you are a mere
nothing, scarcely tolerable even as a
helper-on with a cloak when a play is
over. Perhaps you, dear Lady MABEL,
can explain the reason of all this to a
crass masculine intelligence.
Mrs. MAXWELL has a sister, a Miss
CRAIK, staying with her—a rather showy,
handsome "girl, with lots of fair hair, a
good complexion, a trim figure, and a
horribly unlimited capacity for talking
slang, and, to use her own words, going
one better than the men on every possible
occasion. I 've seen something of men
and women during the thirty years I have
spent (and wasted) in the world, and I am
not easily startled, but I confess that the
manners and laneuage of this young
woman made me shiver. But I suppose
we fools are to blame, for some of us
pretend to like that kind of thing, and to
admire the bold, unconventional freedom
of a girl who is apt to slap us on the back
after nalf-an-hour's acquaintance.
I don't know why 1 have bored you
with all this discourse. You must find
the reason in your own kindness, for you
have made me feel that it is (rood and
pleasant to gossip with the mistress of
Pentland, even though it be merely by letter. Give my love to little
HAEET, and tell him that I have no doubt the Duke will view with
favour his application for a Commission (direct from the nursery) in
the Blues. Five years is perhaps younger than the average age of
that gallant regiment, but, after all, ardour and determination are
better than mere length of years.
I hope you will have fine weather, a good shoot, and a right plea-

sant party on the 14th.
Yours very sincerely,
VICTOK MAYDEW.
OUR DOCTORS.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
JTni/se of Commons, Monday, April 30. — Not an honester nor
kinder-hearted man in House than JOHN GILBERT TALBOT. High-
minded, sensitively conscientious, naturally a little unhappy as he
went off to dinner to-night thinking of the trap he had unconsciously,
certainly undesignedly, laid for ROBERT
GRANT WEBSTER. It happened when
LLOYD GEORGE, in softest voice, was

raging furiously against the Church in
Wales. Mere mention of the Church
Mp f,,r TI
.1 . 1OI I1U11UJV .
touches TALBOT to the quick. Any dis-
respectful reference excites his keenest
indignation. His best - remembered
Parliamentary remark was delivered
on the historical occasion when GRAND
CROSS, at that time still with us in the
House of Commons, defended the
bishops from an attack made upon
their Parliamentary position. It was
in the lobby, whither he had withdrawn
to hide his emotion, that TALBOT, sadly
shaking his head, and assuming an
expression more than usually lugu-
brious, slimmed up the situation in
poignant phrase. He is not so effective
in ordered speech, being somewhat too
obviously weighted with more than his
, . < cii'll l_ • 1
share of human woe. Still, he is always
listened to with the respect high personal character extorts even
in most frivolous mood of House of Commons.
To-night he broke silence several times whilst LLOYD GEOKGE spoke
disrespectivelv of the Church in Wales. WEBSTER sitting behind
quietly enough; but at sight of this venerable figure popping up like
a clerical Jaek-in-the-pulpit, he began to move restlessly. Once or
twice he rose, but TALIIOT, happening to be on feet at moment he
dropped back in his seat. "I rise to a point of order," he from time
to time shouted. At length he got his chance; GEOHGE resumed his
seat; House silently awaited point of order.
"The Hon. Gentleman," WEBSTER thundered forth, in his most
magisterial manner, " says he quoted from an official return these
Hgures showing the relative numbers of Nonconformists and Church-
goers in Wales. Was there," he added,' dropping his voice to tragic
notes, " an official enumeration?"
"That is noquestion of Order," said the SPEAXER, shortly, even
sharply; and WEBSTER, suddenly subsiding from condition of almost
dangerous effervescence, limply resumed his seat.
TALBOT, conscience-stricken, wounded more deeply than if the
blow had fallen direct upon himself, also subsided, and shortly after
the congregation peacefully dispersed.
Business done. — Bill Disestablishing Welsh Church read first time.
Tuesday.— Rather a serious evening. Registration Bill down for
Second Reading. EDWABD
CLARKE criticised it for up-
wards of an hour; DILKE
in succeeding hour criticised
CLABKE, and defended Bill.
For all practical purposes,
House might just as well,
much more usefully, have
forthwith divided, sent the
Bill into Committee, and
worked it up there. Of
course, that would never do.
Speeches been prepared, and
must bfi delivered.
A dozen Members sprang
up with portentous sheaves
of notes in hand.
"Mr. DISRAELI !" said the
SPEAKER,..
Old Members started to
hear the old- familiar name,
long .unused. Would there
appear at either side of the
tame the bowed figure, the
wrjnkled face, and the still
miraculously glossy curl
wreathed adown the high
forehead? Ins'tead there rose
from below the Gangway,
from the seat occupied by WILLIAM O'BRIEN before he regained his
breeches and lost his voice, a dapper youth, bearing no resemblance
to his great namesake, save a peculiar hoist of the shoulders. He

distrusted the Bill, and said so in a speech that might have been
"delivered by JONES, or even by BROWW.
SARK has an idea that particular names, rendered illustrious by
individuals, should lapse at their death. It would, in his view—and
he is an unpresumptious person—have been all right if DIZZY'S
heritors and successors could have taken the title of BEACONSFIELD.
Nobody cares about that, unless it be Garter King-at-Arms. But
the name of DISRAELI is a precious House of Commons possession.
"Makes me sad," said SARK, "to have it associated with pointless
speech, unillumined by a stray flash of humour."
Business done.—Second reading debate on Registration Bill.
Thursday.—Rumour current this afternoon presaging early resig-
nation of SPEAKER. Mere mention of such contingency sufficient to
eclipse the gaiety of House, already undermined by debates on Regis-
tration and Welsh Disestablishment. No man is indispensable; but
House of Commons, accustomed to the passing of great figures, stands
aghast at mere mention of possibility of missing from the Chair the
stately presence of ARTHUR PEEL. None but those who spend their
nights and days in the House of Commons know how much he is to
it, or how much the country, whose interests are closely bound up
with those of its Parliament, owes to him.
By happy accident, contemporaneous with currency of this rumour,
SPEAKER nad opportunity of testifying, under peculiar daunting cir-
cumstances, to maintenance of unshaken vigour of mind and body.
Cap'en TOMMY BOWLES, having temporarily intermitted task of
instructing SQUIRE OF MALWOOD upon the intricacies of finance;
CAWMELL-BANNERMAN in the science of war; BRYCE in the niceties
of Americanpolitics; SHAW-LEFEVHE in the law regulating public
commons; HERBERT GARDNER on the rotation of crops; EDWARD
GREY on Imperial duties at the Equator; SYDNEY BI/XTOX upon the
safest way of extending our Empire in South Africa; WALTER
FOSTER on the contingencies that environ vaccination; the LORD
ADVOCATE on the practice of hypothek in the time of JUSTINIAN; the
ATTORNEY-GENERAL on the means of increasing his legal income;
and having given up trying to teach MUNDELLA seamanship, under-
took to convince SPEAKER that Registration Bill was in hopeless
state of disorder, necessitating its immediate withdrawal.
House listened in respectful amazement whilst the CAP'EN, show-
ing as intimate acquaintance with ERSKINE MAY on Parliamentary
procedure as he might be supposed to have with Longley on Latitude,
seemed to be demonstrating something. What it exactly was no
one but the SPEAKER knew. He, however, more erudite even
than TOMMY. It appeared from his clear, impressive statement,
that if at end of title of Registration Bill there had been added
the words " and for purposes connected therewith," all would have
been lost. Bill must have been withdrawn, and, in present block of
business, hopeless to bring it in again. Happily, instead of "con-
nected therewith," had been written "consequential thereon."
That, as the CAP'EN would have observed had he been on another tack,
made all taut. SUUIXK OF MALWOOD, who had scarcely ventured
to breathe during delivery of this judgment, heaved deep sigh of
relief. It had been a close shave, but aU was well.
"Worst of TOMMY," said our new ATTORNEY-GENERAL, regarding
him with fresh terror flushing his mobile countenance, "is, you
never know where to have him. Always breaking out in fresh place,
the more unexpected the more fascinating its attraction for him."
Business done.—More of Registration Bill.
Friday, 10.25 P.M.—Seemed to be in for a pleasant evening, after
rather heavy afternoon. WILFRID LAWSON on with motion propos-
ing that, when honours and titles are conferred, statement of the
services that had won them should be published. Several names occur
which indicate the embarrassment inevitable if such a course were
adopted. SQFIRE OF MALWOOD would not listen to suggestion;
proposal was negatived.
Then uprose SAM SMITH with resolution on Bimetallism. Net-
ton o'clock yet; at least two hours to dicuss the enchanting topic;
Members rubbed their hands in keen anticipation; a pleased smile
suffused the benches; large number of Members couldn't contain
their joy within limits of decorum imposed by SPEAKER'S presence in
Chair; went out to give full course to their delight; consequence
was, when KNOX rose to read the second paper of the series, House was
counted out.
Business done.—On second reading Registration Bill, Government
Majority reduced to 14.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUE BOOKING-OFFICE.
MY Baronite, to his distinguished Chief,
deponeth and sayeth :—
The Life of General Sir Hope Grant, with
Selections from )iis Correspondence, edited
by Colonel HENRY KNOLLYS, just published
by BLACKWOOD, turns over again the ever
fascinating pages of the Story of the Indian
Mutiny. HOPE GRANT, then'in the prime of
life, and in command of the Ninth Lancers,
went through it all, in the front rank of the
dauntless body of Great Britons who first
withstood and finally beat back the native
flood that for a while threatened to swamp
the English in India. As the despatches
show, HOPE GRANT'S share in the hard won
victory was second to few. These two hand-
some volumes are chiefly made up of extracts
from his diary, written amid the smoke of
battle. There is, my Baronite says, some-
thing sublime in the matter-of-fact manner
in which he jots down record of thrilling
incident, much as if he were entering a
memorandum of a sail from Westminster
Bridge to Chelsea, or a ride in the park. Day
after day and night after night, at Cawn-
poor, Lucknow, and Delhi, HOPE GRANT lived
on intimate terms with Death, with the pro-
verbial result. It did not breed exactly con-
tempt, but there was induced absolute indif-
ference. A choice companion spirit was found
in COLIN CAMPBELL, who commanded the
relief operations. In one of the almost hourly
fights it is written " Sir COLIN was struck in
the stomach by a spent rifle-shot, which nearly
doubled him up, but did not othem-ise injure
him." The italics are not HOPE GRANT'S.
He docs not use them. But isn't the touch
delightful — a man nearly doubled up by
receipt of a rifle-shot in the stomach, • but
not otherwise injured." Perhaps HOPE GRANT
was thinking of the graver consequences
which followed on the delivery of a famous
chunk of old red sandstone, the subsequent
proceedings interesting no more the recipient.
By a like shot," he adds, "when talking to
Sir COLIN and MANSFELD, I was hit in the
side with such force that for some moments
I could not speak. Happily I was only
bruised." Exactly. But these methods of
interrupting a friendly conversation are, to
say the least, inconvenient. Of such stuff
is the British Army made. As a means of
keeping up its tone, Mr. CAMPBELL-BANNEB-
MAN might do much worse than include in
the Army Estimates the small vote necessary
to supply every mess-room throughout the
Empire with a copy of Colonel KNOLLYS' book.
Quoth the Baron, " I admit that I am one
of those given to what Sir WALTER SCOTT in
Kedgaitiitlvt styles ' The laudable practice of
skipping.' With the skipper Sir WALTER
owns to having ' a strong fellow-feeling.' It
is good indeedto possess such high authority
for being a skipper in novels. Yet the skipper
must beware. Give him plenty of rope for
skipping and maybe he will skip no more.
A jirtipos of Sir WALTER," continued the
Baron, "I had up to now thought that ' hard
lines' was a modern slang expression. Not
a bit of it; it is in Kcdyauntlet. The man
who is in charge of the hshing station says
'It is hard lines for me to leave your honour.
When did 'hard lines' travel south? By
rail?"

THAT HAT.
(At the Private View.)
I 'LL see, I fear, not a picture here,
For ever there comes between
A flower-bed on a lady's head—
That's pretty well all 1 've seen.
I dodge and dive, but I can't contrive
To peep past the things that trim
That tar from flat, waving, curling hat,
With it's quite enormous brim.
I 'm short, she's tall, I can't see at all,
And she always comes between;
Though quick or slow be my pace, no go,
In front she has ever beeii.
So all I know of this picture show
Is a brim that scrapes my nose,
On which upright, half a yard in height,
Stands, "mowing and growing," a rose.
AFTER THE BALL.
(Fragment from a Record at the End of the
Season.)
THE stranger had heard shouts and cries,
but had seen no smoke. He had ascribed the
latter characteristic of the fray to the newest
invention in gunpowder. Still the noise was
terrific. He could not see the combatants
engaged in their fierce contest, but every now
and again a victim was carried to the rear.
Sometimes to the ambulance-tent, sometimes
to a retiring-room of even a sadder nature.
The fight was evidently hotly contested, and
the list of the lost and wounded would he a
very long one.
"And how many patients have you,
Doctor?" asked the stranger, as he entered
the hospital tent.
"Oh, about the average. Six broken legs,
ten fractured arms, twelve staved-in ribs,
and seven collar-bones unsettled. Had this
poor fellow's neck been twisted half an inch
more, they would have had to carry him to
the other tent. It would have been all up
with him."
And then the stranger noticed that although
the marquee was fuU of suffering men, there
were no signs of warfare. He saw no swords,
no rifles, and no accoutrements.
"And where was the battle fought?"
asked the stranger.
"What battle?" queried the Doctor.
"Why the battle in which these poor
fellows came by their wounds."
"Oh, it wasn't in a battle," returned the
Medico, "that my patients got into such
straits. No, they owe their presence here to
joining in a game of football.

How best a buyer to entice,

A TURN FOR THE HANDEL
-FESTIVAL.
MT DEAR GOOD FRIEND, MR.
P., MY SWEET.BUT NEVER
GREEN, P., — We have got
our triennial Handel Festival
coming on in June. "Try any,
all Handel at this Festival,
and pick 'em where you like.
Give this Handel a turn, my
dear Mr. P.!
We 've that Gye-antess as a
songstress Madame ALBANI
coming, likewise MELBA (on
whose name my friend WAGG-
STAFF can only pun when he
has a cold id 'is 'ed, and sings,
"Then you 'U re-Melba me!"
Oh!); also Maid MABIA.V
(M'KESzre). Then of course
the merry MANNS with his
merry men, and the Organist
EYRE, who is 'igher up than
most of the performers, in fact
the only thing at the C. P.
that can anger anybody con-
nected with the Festival is
the position of the organist,
because, from the moment we
were compelled to place him
where he is now perched aloft,
it became evident to everyone
that our EYRE was raised. If,
as some persons insist on doinff,
you pronounce his name as atr
and not ire, then your angry
passions need not rise, and you
are simply delighted to have
such an Air on the organ.
But alas! the news has just
arrived that this EYBE is not
strong enough for the Handel
constitutien, and so his place
will be taken by Mr. WALTER
HEDOCOCK, quite a "rara arts." CHARLES
THE FIRST (and only) SANTI.EY will be there;
high BEN DA VIES will be all there, but Ben
Nevis cannot come, and he 's a trifle higher:
we 've caught our NORMAN SALMOND, than
whom no better by musical doctors has ever
been ex-salmpnd. Mr. ANDREW BUCK, not
a Christy Minstrel as his name suggests,
sings in this Festival for the first time; and
EDWARD LLOYD is a certainty,—at least, if
he didn't come after promising, "Whoy
then," as the Yorkshireman broadly observed,
"he told a loy, and so after all it s EDWABD
Loyd."
So, Mr. P., 'twill be a big occasion, a great
show! So don't forget to book it, and come
to see your dear old CRYSTAL PAL.
P.S.—Lots of seats for everyone who comes
to Syd-in-'cm! (Ahem!)
TOO WILLINGLY LET DIE.
[According to the JJaily Neu-s of the 28th ult.,
an inscription on the front of No. 34, Kue de
Richelieu, Paris, announces that MOLI£KK'S death
occurred there, while No. 40 also claims in a
similar manner to occupy the site of the house
where he died.]
BEHOLDERS, getting back their breaths,
Must deem one statement—unveraeious;
And yet, perhaps, it took two deaths
To kill a being so vivacious.
Conjectures, probably, are rife;
But this, at least, may be decided:
MOLIKRE was pleasant in his life,
Though in his death he be divided.

counted on you to play host for us;
my eldest brother has his own shoot,
and KOLLO is recruiting at Valles-
oure after the fatigues and dis-
appointments of the election. I have
got Mother with me just now on a
long visit; she so looked forward to
seeing you again. "Dear MARY'S
boy, she said; "she and I were
such friends, and called each other
'ARAMINTA' and 'ELVIRA' in our
letters—girls were romantic in those
days—and then we were maids of
honour together, and the dear Queen
used to enioy duets. MABY and I
both learned the harp from CHATTEH-
TON; nowadays girls learn the
trumpet and the cornet I believe."
I am afraid Mother doesn't much
like the latter-day girl: neither the
desperately earnest type with a
mission to the Boot-black Brigade
and a disregard of all home duties,
nor—worst of all—the Miss CRAIK
variety. Oh dear, your description
of her made me shudder! Take
care, or she will marry you before
you know where you are. So many
men are married by girls nowadays—
it is a new development.
Talking of new developments,
what do you think of JOHNNIE
GRAY'S engagement? He has only
£150 a year from his mother, and
can't get anything to do ("Shouldn't
mind a political secretaryship, or an
agency for some big office with good
commissions, don't you know," he
always says in a sort of resigned
voice); but his fiancee. Lord EGBERT
ARDEN'S second jrirl, has an excel-
lent post as lady-housekeeper to one
of the new working-ladies' flats,
with a matron under her; and
directly she gets her next "rise." she

What my party next week will be
without either her or you to help
me, I dare not contemplate. Four
guns, whom I don't particularly
mind, and the wives of two of them,
whom I do. Neither of them is in
the least congenial to me, or would
by any chance have been asked to
Pentland save as the wife of a gun.
Bless me, I 've heard of the son of a
gun; but that's nothing, I 'm sure,
to the wife of a gun. A dreadful
specimen I 've generally found her.
However these four men are old
friends of dear HARRY'S, and have
come to our December shoot for
years. It's an understood thing
now. Captain CHRISTIE'S wife, by
the way, is a sister of your friend
Captain MAXWELL, and simply a
feminine replica—so you may
imagine how sympathetic we are to
each other. What you say of the
popularity of the MAXWELL type of
man is so true, and that's one of the
things we'll talk about when you
come.
Little HARBY shares the general
disappointment, he is panting to
show " Godpa " his sailor suit. "His
dear little leggies would be more
honoured now in the breech than in
the observance, I think," said Mother
(can't you hear her say it), so HABHY
was promoted to trousers. He grows
very like his father (thank you, dear
friend, for vour words about him),
but has the BORODALE eyes, and often
reminds Mother of TARNAWAY and
HOLLO when they were little, she
says. He does little lessons with me
now, and has developed a passion for
arithmetic. '' What comes after mil-

day; "oh yes, billions, of course,

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
MY Baronite-in-Chief sends me the follow-
ing opinion on a new work. He says:—" The
Green Hay Tree, joint work of W. H. WIL-
KINS and HERBERT VIVIAN, published by
HUTCHIXSON & Co., is, truly, as its second
title denotes, a tale of to-day. The pity of it
is it should be so sorry a one. These young
men know their Harrow, their Cambridge,
their London, with its varying phases of
the season, and Monte Carlo with its smiling
sea and its (sometimes) gloomy Casino. They
skim the froth of society, and, on the whole,
the product is exceedingly distasteful. But
that is not their fault. They did not make
the wide world and all that therein is, though
there are not lacking in the writing of the
work traces of evidence that they would have
felt equal to :the task had it been imposed
upon them. As it is, their duty i*limited to
transfering to their canvas portraits of some
of the personages who scamper by in the whirl
of society, and sketches of some of the scenes
their conjunction creates. It is all smartly
done. No flagging on any page of the three
vot en.
volumes, with here and there — notably the
chapters describing the opening of the Cory-
ton honeymoon at the 'Lord Warden,' and the
closing of the Tvrconnel honeymoon at Monte
Carlo—powerfully delineated episodes. The
sketches of school and college life are evi-
dently reminiscent of personal experiences,
whilst those who live in London Society to-
day will fancy they recognise familiar faces
flitting through the book." My Baronite is
more fortunate than his Chief, who had a
gallant struggle with the first volume of the
O. H. T. But " I am quite content with this
opinion of a trusted expert, and shall not
take any further trouble to form my own on
this book," quoth THE BAKON DE B.-W.

BRILLIANT STARS AT THE ST. JAMES'S.
And then as beforehand they had thrown dice for Penelope
Annel so now they betake themselves to cards, so that the original

written a strik'ingly-dramatic play, of which the two great scenes
are so daringly improbable that, had they not been acted to per-
fection by Mr. GEORGE ALEXANDER and Mr. HERBKHT WARING,
aided in the second and more powerful situation by Mrs. PATRICK
CAMPBELL, the fate of the piece would have been seriously imperilled.
But the author is justified of his actors, and the play, a triumph for
both, is drawing over-crowded houses.
First Act: hunt ball at old-fashioned inn of county town. Ad-
one calls the other "cheat," and the other retaliates with
"swindler"; and then, just as Darid Remon pitches into Sir
Brice, so Cox is about to rush on Box, and Box to rush on Cox,
when—but as the scene is familiar to every amateur it is needless to
recall the details. Is it not incredible that a playwright such as is
the erudite JONES should have been in happy ignorance of this
classic?
Well, the half-drunken Sir Brice loses, and then is knocked over,
mirably painted and arranged: view of bar below; of corridor, or and shaken violently (his lost wife being still present, rather enjoy-

on which play turns is an appeal to the gallery—viz. the selling by threatens to murder him if he dares ever to interfere with his own
auction, in the presence of the county ladies and gentlemen, of a : wife, who will be, from henceforth, the mistress of Mr. Darid
Barmaid's Kiss!! The amateur auctioneer is a kind of burlesqued Remon. At last an English dramatic author has justified the popu-
Careless selling Charles Surface's ancestors at the hammer. Even lar belief of the French people, that English noblemen sell their
had Miss Dulcie Larondie been but a
common barmaid, the gracious and
approving presence of the high-bred
ladies, entering into "the fun of the
thing," would surely have been an
impossibility. True that 'EXERY
HAUTHOR shows one minor character,
Lord Crandorer, mildly protesting.
But Lady Crandover should have
initiated the protest; and, as apparently
the only chaperon present, would she
not have risen witn dignity and have
bade her daughter and the other young
ladies follow her back to the ball-
room, which the entire party had tem-
porarily abandoned, probably during an
interval allowed the band for refresh-
ment? Again, as this barmaid is
known to be a young lady " in reduced
circumstances, with evidently a con-
siderable amount of self-respect, surely
she would have retired to her own room.
All the does, however, is to expostulate
in dumb show with two or three of the
supernumeraries, and the only practi-
cally solid reason against her retire-
ment seems to be that in this hotel of
Mr. JONES'S there is no one else except
the aged proprietor, Brinkler, to attend
to the business. Of course 'ENERY
HATTTHOR has taken out his own
"poetic licence," and can do what he
likes on his own public-house premises.
In this Act the character-part of the
old huntsman, as played by Mr.
WILLIAM H. DAT, could not be bettered.
During the entr'acte one George
Cope/anrf(heartilyrendered by Mr. BEN
WEBSTER), an ingeniously conceived
variety of "CHARLES his friend," has
gone off, died, and left his entire for-
tune, for no particular reason (which is
reason enough, of course), to David
Remon. So in the Second Act David,
the poor astronomer, is a rich man.

kill the now inconvenient Sir Brice.
UK that would be too old and hackneyed
an expedient, so he shows us the rich
astronomer, the unprincipled winner
of the Wife and Nursery Stakes,
the desperately infatuated and long-
hungering lover. Darid Remon, sud-
denly converted by the copy-book
morality of a nursing sister, seconded
by the whimpering sentimentality of a
foolish, vapouring younger brother, a
kind of aesthetic effeminate roysterer
(and the highest praise is due to Mr.
H. V. ESMOND for his rendering this
unreal character so as not only not to
make it ridiculous, but to win for it
the audience's warmly-expressed ap-
preciation), whom David can kick or
caress just as he feels inclined. Out
of the Ibsenitish drama no such demi-
sexed creation as this Eddie Remon
pan, as far as I know, be found. It is
in this character that JONES salutes
IBSEN. And so the astronomer, pas-
sionately loving the woman he has
won, who passionately returns his love,
renounces her, gives her up, as if she
were an insoluble riddle,—which she
isn't; and saving, airily and astro-
nomically. "We will meet again in
Andromeda"—he might just as well
have said "We will go and stay with
my old friend the Man in the Moon"
—he departs on his astronomical ex-
pedition. Was ever tale more im-
probable? This last Act gives the
audience a cold douche, which would
be fatal to the success of the play had
not the overwhelming force of the
Third Act triumphed over all obstacles,
past, present, and future.
The best light comedy scene of the
play is in the Third Act between Mr.

the rich astronomer of a cheque-book and unlimited credit at his immensely,
bankers to Lady Skene, we come to the Third Act, where, in the
great situation of the play, Mr. ALEXANDER'S acting is the finest
thing he has ever done. He lets himself go with a vengeance, and
he is magnificently seconded by Mr. WARING.
And what is this situation? Remon, the virtuous, self-sacrificing
lover, proposes to Sir Brice Skene that they two shall play cards—
two cuts out of three—the stakes being Reman's two hundred
thousand pounds against Sir_ Brice's wife and baby! The baby
is certainly a prize one, and is exhibited to the audience by Nurse
Helen Larondie. a part effectually played by Miss GRANVILLE.
But is this telling situation quite new? Will our 'ENERY HAOTHOR
JONES venture to deny that the original of this scene is to be found
in one of the strongest situations of that immortal dramatic work
Box and Cox f I submit the quotation:—
"Sox (David Remon). I have it! Suppose we draw lots for the lady?
Eh, Mr. Cox „. Cox (Sir Sriet Skf»e). That's fair enough, Mr. Box.

ANNE (Itnlcie L'arandit)': Cor. The very thing I was going to propose."
And now—Why is it called The Masqueraders? Is it because
human action is travestied by the author? Who "masquerades''?
Not the brutal husband; not the lovers; not the cynical friends Sir
Benjamin Backbite Lushington and Lady Sneertcell Shelford, for
these persons do not in any way disguise their real sentiments, but,
on the contrary, air them in public with obtrusive cynicism; not the
voung gentlemen of the Hunt; not the matronly Lady Crandover.
But if none of these, who represent The Matqueraders t Simply
nobody.
As to the plot. Puff's immortal answer to his critic Dangle must
be borne in mind and quoted on behalf of Mr. HENRY ARTHUR
JONES. "But," asks Donate, after hearing Puff describe a strong
situation in his own play, '' won't this appear rather improbable?
Puff replies, " To be sure it will—but what the plague! a play is
not to show occurrences that happen every day, but things just so
strange, that though they never did, they might happen." Nothing
succeeds like success; and this is, without doubt, a daring, but a
deserved success, and 'EXRY ASTRONOMER JONES "may bless his
lucky stars" at the St. JAMES'S.

QUITE A LITTLE (BANK) HOLIDAY.
(A Page from Nobotii/ in Particular's Diary.)
WOKE at throe, and did not like to drop off again for fear I should
oversleep myself. However, did, and consequently had to dress in
ten minutes. No time for breakfast. Had to run to catch the train.
Too early for omnibuses, and didn't see the pull of taking a cab.
Got to the station just as they were closing the doors. However,
managed to buy my ticket and scrambled into overcrowded compart-
ment. Counted my change and found myself
half-a-erown short. Must have left it in the
pigeon-hole at the booking-office. However,
might have been worse; might have lost half
a sovereign. Still, just my luck. Irritated at
seeing over-dressed foreigner smiling at my
disappointment.
Sudden intrusion in overcrowded compart-
ment resulted in unpleasant remarks about
people who won't come in time, and will in-
convenience everybody. Nobody makes room,
and everybody glares" at an elderly traveller,
much encumbered with luggage, who tries to
get in. Find standing for hours in a cramped
position far from pleasant. But can't be helped. Train don't stop
until we get to our journey's end. Wish they would open the
windows, but they won't. Wish they wouldn't smoke, but they will.
Get to Snaresborough at last. It isn't much of a town. In fact,
it's more of a village than anything else. If you walk a hundred
yards anyway you come to flat country. The flat country consists
chiefly of miles of fields. It's got an old church, but the church isn't
open. Key with the Sexton. The Sexton can't be found, as he has
gone to London for a holiday. He has taken the key with him.
Snaresborough much better in fine weather than in wet. To-day
it rains. Ask old inhabitant if he thinks it will clear up by-and-by.
No; he doesn't. When it rains at Snaresborough it generally keeps

at it for a week. It has been raining for the last four days, so
it is likely to be fine by Wednesday. As this is Monday and
I have to catch the 7.30 train to 'town, afraid I can't wait.
I ask the old inhabitant if he
knows of any place of interest
in the neighbourhood. He
scratches his head, looks at
me for three minutes, and
says, "Not that he's heard
of." I am moving off, when
he adds that perhaps I would
like to go to " the top of St.
Syce." On further inquiry I
discover that St. Sims (pro-
nounced "St. Syce") is a
local hill of some celebrity.
Is there anything to be seen
when I reach the summit?
"No, not that he's heard of."
I enter the "Black Bear,"
and find it full of weary
merry-raakers. I ask if I can
have anything to eat. In-
attentive barmaid says " No," and gives a villager some beer.
I repeat my question to a person who seems to be the landlord,
and he says he will consult his missis. After consultation, he
tells me that he thinks I can have some eggs and bacon in the
course of "a couple of hours or so." I ask him how long it
will take me to get to the summit of "St. Syce" and back;
and he returns, A couple of hours or so." This decides me
to make the ascent.
I walk for about a mile and a half along an extremely muddy
road, and then begin to climb. I get over a hedge, and enter
a wood. I find myself much impeded by brambles. However,
bv plodding away in the rain I at length get to the summit.
When I have arrived at my destination I find there is nothing
particular to be seen except mist. I consult my watch, to learn
that "the two hours or so" has been lengthened into about
double that period. It occurs to me that by the time I get back
the eggs and bacon should be ready.
Although my descent is now downhill, I don't progress very
rapidly, as the clayey mud is thicker than ever. After another
couple of hours'hardwork I once more find myself in the village
inn. I ask the inattentive barmaid if my dinner is ready.
She replies (after a pause), "What dinner?" and gives a
countryman a mug, presumably containing beer. I explain,
"Eggs and bacon." She (again after a pause) replies. " What
eggs and bacon?" and gives another countryman another mug,
presumably containing beer. At this point the landlord, who
has a gleam of intelligence, asks me, Was I the gent who
ordered something in the afternoon:"" On hearing my affir-
mative, he adds, "Then your dinner was eaten by another gent.
I thought as how there was something wrong somewhere." He
seems amused, so does his missis, so does the inattentive bar-
maid. I would reply angrily, if a glance at the clock did not
inform me that I have but ten minutes to catch my train back to
town. I hurry away, and am forced into a carriage constructed to
carry twelve passengers which is already crowded with fifteen. My
appearance is greeted with disfavour. However, after I have been
in the compartment for an hour or two, my
presence is tolerated. I gain good-will by not
objecting to the smoking of rank tobacco and the
singing of oft-repeated comic songs. I reach the
terminus.cramped and weary, hungry and damp.
All the omnibuses have ceased running, and
I can't find a cab. On my way home I come
across my cousin in a mud-covered uniform, who
has been enjoying a day with the Volunteers. I
recount my adventures, laying stress upon the
absence of food and the need for exertion.
"Ah," says he, in a faint voice; "you have
had a better time of it than we have!"
From this I take it that on the whole he envies
me. I get home to bed, and just write this diary before putting out
the light.
Take it all in all, I have enjoyed myself immensely. Such a
perfect change! Feel so tired that I am sure I should fall asleep—
even in a theatre!
MR'. K. was in an omnibus lately. The streets were so badly
paved, she says, that the osculations were most trying to elderly
people, though the younger ladies did not seem to object to them.

A MONSTER PARLIAMENTARY MEETING IN VACATION TIME.
LAYS FROM THE LINKS.
To ii Parliamentary Candidate.
WERE you deaf and dumb and dotty, you might solve the question
knotty
Of the way your country's suffrages to earn;
All you want's a wife who's pretty, and can sing a party ditty,
To secure your Parliamentary return.
You will find your new vocation is a lib'ral education,
Repartee, in all its branches, you will learn,
And a yawn you'll merely smother when you're told that " you're
another "—
It is quite a Parliamentary return.
You may temper legislation with some harmless recreation,
For a foursome you should now and then adjourn;
Once a week yourself uprooting from you wonted seat, to Tooting
Take a third, or Parliamentary, return.
For the handicap you'll enter, of admiring gaze the centre—
'Tis for fame not handy capital you yearn—
And I hope that you may win it, and the House will makj a minute
Of your record Parliamentary return.
On the Links, or when on duty in the House, made rirlute!
Till with pride your whole constituency burns:
By the '' gods and little fishes" you 've my very best good wishes—
Many happy Parliamentary returns!
"THE REFORM OF GENERAL AVERAGE." — Such is the weird
heading of a recent newspaper paragraph. Who is General
AVERAGE? And why should he be reformed? Or is it a burlesque
on The Silence af Dean Maitland?
APPROPRIATE.—Health to the new married couple in a bumper of
Chateau Margot!
DIARY OF AN INTELLIGENT CITIZEN.
Monday.—Read all the morning the fearful expenses incurred by
the School Board. Fancy paying two millions a year to educate
half a million of children! Seems monstrous. Does indeed. Must
be careful to vote at the next election. Find that the contest is fixed
for Saturday.
Tuesday.—Still getting up facts about the School Board. Not
only two millions of money paid every year, but lots of it wasted.
Really must vote on Saturday, and for the right men. The scandal
has lasted too long, and all our fault. Why won't we vote? The
matter is really in our own hands. And yet we won't move a step!
Disgraceful!
Wednesday.—Looking up fresh statistics. Seems that in East
Finsbury only 16,000 voted out of a possible 86,800, and much the
same proportion was observed in East Lambeth, Chelsea, and
Hackney. Really disgraceful! But at least I will do my duty on
Saturday. Only wish others were like me.
Thursday.—More statistics. Fearful waste in all directions, and
all sorts of nonsense. Some children overworked. Pupils ill from
study, teachers not too well paid, and a great deal ton much atten-
tion given to useless accomplishments and sectarian disagreements.
However, wait till Saturday! I will be there, and I will vote, at
any rate.
Friday.—Yes, to-morrow is the polling day. Well, I only hope :•
tveryone will behave like me.
Saturday.—As I thought it might rain, I did not go to the polling-
place. Better luck next year—if I remember it.
"An!" observed Mrs. R., speaking about a middle-aged gentleman
of most exemplary iharacter. "He wasn't always like this, I
believe. 1 have heard that as a young man he was mixed up in all
sorts of piccadillies."

ROBERT ON THE GRAND TOWER BRIDGE!
I DON'T exacly kno how it came about, but I ain't bin at all well
lately. I carat say as I've bin a hindulging more than usual, tho
we most suttenly has bin rayther a going it, thanks to the amost
boundless ginerosity of our nght honnerabel and most liberal LORD
M A KK. I m promised a reglar holly-day about the hend of nex
month, when the Prince and Princess of WALES is a coin mi Tig into
the City, with their usual kindness, to hopen our grand Tower
Bridge, which one of the principal makers on it tells me is about the
grandest Tower Bridge in the world, and will cost the grand old
Copperashun jest about a hole million of money! He also tells me
that so wunderfully is the Bridge made, that when any ship, however
big it may be, wonts to pass thro it, all the Pilot has to do is to blow
his wissal and the Bridge will open of itself in two minutes and a
harf I The poor Bridge Committee seems to be oilers at work about
it, and well deserves their bits of luncheon, and I supposes as it was
a sort of small reward for my xtra trouble about them, that I was
most kindly allowed to see the but i t'ul gold Badges as is a being made
for the Committee to wear when the Prince and Princess comes, and
werry werry splendid they is. Why so werry particuler is the Com-
mittee that t nay has aoshally had the Invit ushuii Cards speshally
printed for the ocasion, so that all the many wisitors on the grand
dav may have a memoreal to keep to alters remind em of it.
What the distinguist onners will be that will be heaped by the
royal Prince and Princess on the LORD MARK, and the Sherrif s, and
the Chairman, and the hard working Committee, in course nobody
yet knos, but as their royal Bignesses acts in the name of Her
Majesty the QUEEN, in course they will be simply staggerers.
1 remembers werry well going to see the werry fust stone of the
Bridge laid, ever so many years ago, and not one of us ever thought
as how as we shoud live to see it finished, and lots of clever fellers,
as they thought theirselves, all prosefied as it woud never be big
enuff or igh enuff to let a great big ship go thro it without a
breaking of it; and I well remembers now artily some on em larfed
when they was told that it woudn't take above 2 or 3 minnet* to
hopen or shut it again 1 But they don't larf now, but beleeves what
they are told by our grate Engineer, like all good Cristiens ort to do,
speshally if a Royal Prince and Princess comes and shows cm all as
there really ain't not nothink for to be afraid on.
Strange to say, I hears from one of the men as how as the Guverner
of the Tower, which is close by, is that gelous of the Bridge, that he
has applied to the Dook of CAMBRIDGE to make the Copperashun alter
the name of it, and call it the Terns Bridge, or sum such common
name, but the Dook, like the reel gent as he is, has refused to do so,
and says it's a werry good name for it considering its great Light
and its grand size.
The Copperashun, with its usual ginerosity, don't mean to charge
not nothink to go over it or to go under it, tho it will cost em jest
about a hole round million, which clever BBX>WN tells me is jest
about a thowsend thowsend soverainsl And if that ain't about
enuff for our Bridge, I should like to know what is, speshally as I 'm
told that it is more than all the other five London Bridges cost put
together!
But that's just like the jolly old Copperashun, when they makes
up their mind to do a big thing they does it thoroly, and leaves
others to toiler their xampel, if they can. ROBERT.
To W. Grace, Junior.
BRAVO, Sir! A hundred and twenty and six
Before they could find the right way to your sticks,
Should prove you a chip of—well, not " the old black,"
That would seem the free play of the Champion to mock.—
But a GRACE of the GRACES. 'Tis pleasant to see—
'Ere the elder has passed—a young "W. G."!

there's a niche in it."

that nothing less than three

before debate on second read-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
So here we are, mercifully only a few of us,
watching the dreary game. List of speakers
drawn up long enough to keep things going
till Thursday night. No lack of volunteers
for speech-making. Only stipulate they shall
not be expected to remain to hear others.
SQUIRE OK MALWOOD behaves with great
heroism. Has fortified himself with stock of
foolscap paper sewn at the corner. On this he,
with ostentatious benignity, takes notes. As
each sheet is filled he turns it over, and,
holding it between finger and thumb, lets it
hang forlornly flapping, whilst, with crossed
hands and look of sainted resignation, he sits
and waits for the next speaker.
This turns out to be that other great Syi IBK
the Man from Blankney. At White's and
at Newmarket there is a general impression
that on finance, as on any other question, the
SQUIRE OF BLANKXEY could give a stone to
the SQUIRE OF MALWOOD and beat him.
CHAPLIS himself suspects there is something
in this, and justifies the assertion in a pro-
digiously learned speech. What he most bit-
terly protests against is "the dumb silence"
on the Treasury Bench.
I did not hear it myself; hut 'tis a blessed
phrase, its coining making stronger than ever
the vearning for the spread of silence, dumb
or otherwise, over the mechanism of the talk-
ing machine.
Business done.—None.
Friday, 1 A.H.—Everything comes to the
man who waits, even the end of the dreariest
debate of modern times. Responsibilities of
leadership imposed on PRINCE ARTHUR duty
of making long speech by way of summing
up Budget discussion from Opposition side.
Ordeal too much even for his gay courage.
Stumbled heavily amid dry phrases belonging
to the Probate Court; couldn't always hit on
the right one; had spent much time on dis-
-tasteful lesson; got it off pretty well by heart;
but, not being quite clear to himself, case,
naturally, not pellucid for audience. Still
thev sat it through, buoyed up by expectation
of the end.
SQUIRE OF MALVOOD at least understood his
case. Got it all at his finger ends. Had, for
greater accuracy, set it forth in series of
sewed volumes of manuscript. Volume I.,
Wine and Spirit Duties; Vol. II., Graduated
DeathDuties; Vol.IIL.IncomeTax; Vol.IV.,
Bang JOKIM about the Head.
Though there was evidence in the delight
with which the SQUIRE took up Vol. IV. that
this was specially designed for the comfort
and consolation of JOKIM, refutation of the
financial heresies of that eminent man pretty
frequently cropped up in preceding volumes.
"My master," "my teacher," said the SQUIRE
in severest irony, looking across the table to
see how JOKIM took his punishment. House,
now crowded, roused at last. Cheers and
counter cheers stirred the heavy atmosphere.
"Now, Sir, I venture to say, if I may use a
vulgar expression "observed the SQUIBE.
"Oh! oh!" cried the gentlemen in the corner
behind Front Opposition Bench, terribly
shocked. "If I may ." "Hoi no!*
They would not have it on any account;
SQUIRE persisted. When it turned out that
his vulgar expression was nothing more than
the taunt that Members opposite were "be-
ginning to see it is not safe to face the music,"
unmistakeable evidence of disappointment.
Thought it was going to be much worse than
that.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MANNERS AND CUSTOMS.
(Being a Series of Private Letters cm these and other Subjects.)
No. III.—FROM THE Hox. VICTOR MAYDEW, CRAXWELL PARF,
SUFFOLK, TO LADY MABEL HUNTEB, PENTLAND HALL, HANTS.
DEAR LADY MABEL, December 16, 189—.
If it were not for Sunday mornings, I really believe country-
house parties as an institution would perish. I mean, of course,
Sunday mornings spent in calm meditation, gentle reading, or the
writing of letters. If one is whirled away by a stern domestic
decree, assisted by a barouche or family omnibus, to the parish
church, the usefulness of the day is gone, for the two happy morn-
ing hours, so peaceful, so restoring, frequently so admirable for the
making up of arrears, fly from you irretrievably. To have seen the
little apple-faced boys who compose the parish choir, and to have
listened to twenty minutes of reproof and exhortation from the
Reverend THOMAS SPAHKES; to have sat in a pew fashioned on the
model of a loose box—these, dear Lady MABEL, are not sufficient
consolations. The apple-faced ones
may please the eye trained to bucolic
sights, but they sing horribly out of
tune; I remember TOMMY SPARKES at
Cambridge as a warning rather than a
fitting warner; and my nature is not
sufficiently equine for an ancient pew.
This is merely another way of say-
ing that I have not gone to church,
though Mrs. BLAGDEN and her
daughters, together with all save one
of the women guests, and two, actu-
ally two, of the men besides our host,
who has to keep up his character as an
M.P. and a supporter of charities and
churches, are at this moment safe in
the big pew. Mrs. BLAGDEN is not
the soul of refinement, but she is
a nice, comfortable, unpretentious,
raotherlv woman. I like her much
better than her rather aspiring girls,
who have airs and graces and wish
to be thought dreadfully smart. Dear
Mrs. BLAGDEN, as she passed through
the hall, looked like a stout morning
meteor—so greatly did she gleam with
brilliant silk, so flashing was the
sweep of her skirts. She shook a
dumpy, good-natured forefinger at
me, and announced roguishly that I
was a bad man, but her tone was not
meant to carry conviction. Still,
there is a delicate suggestion of
flattery in the mere accusation of
devilry—even when it rests on no
firmer foundation than absence from
Sunday morning service.
We have had two good days at the
pheasants, though we have of course
shot no hens. On Friday we got 250
pheasants, five brace of partridges,
four woodcock, 40 hares, and 163
rabbits. Yesterday's bag was 274
pheasants, two woodcock, 27 hares, and 206 rabbits. That is a fair
total for eight guns, two of whom were much worse shots even than
I am on my bad days. Our party consists of Captain and Mrs. MAX-
WELL (without the CRALK sister I am thankful to say), HENRY
BERKELEY, who brought his pretty daughter LUCY—do you know
her? fair, fresh, and well-figured, with a charming smile,'and most
attractive ways—mv brother HAROLD, your Cousin Miss BRUCE,
MANTON of the F. 0., and myself. That gives us five guns; the
Baron PAUL DE CHAUMONT is the sixth, Mr. BLAGI>EN himself
makes a seventh, and the eighth was on Friday a Hussar, who
drove over in the tallest dog-cart I have ever seen. Yesterday
ALAN CROWTHORPE turned up, to my great delight. I had not seen
him for more than five years, and I 'm afraid we missed more than
one good chance while we were exchanging reminiscences which
carried us back through Cambridge to Eton, and beyond into the
region of preparatory schools.
Our dinners have been immense. I must sav the BLAGDENS know
how to do things well, for everything was of the best, and yet there
was no unnecessary ostentation—except, perhaps, in the gorgeously
gold-laced lackeys whose solemn presence tempered even the electric
light, and made one feel how infinitely contemptible an unliveried
life must appear to these resplendent beings. Last night we had an
Archdeacon at dinner—WARBURTON is his name—a most pleasant,
humorous old gentleman, with the courtliest manners. To near him
TOL, en.
discussing modern women with Mrs. MAXWELL was delightful.
"And is it really believed by refined and cultivated women that life
in London becomes insupportable without frequent visits to Variety
shows—that, I believe, is the correct term, is is not?" Thus did he
pose Mrs. MAXWELL, but she retorted in her flat, uncomprehending
way, that she didn't see why women shouldn't go if men went and
found it amusing.
"But do they?" said the Archdeacon. "Many of them have
told me that mus-ic-halls, and the theatres that ape them, are a mere
desolate region of dullness and ennui."
At this poor little Mrs. MAXWELL could only btare, and the
honours of the encounter remained with the Church.
PAUL DE CHAUMONT is a capital fellow, a real sportsman, a good
companion, and a gentleman to his finger-tips. Only a Frenchman
could be so utterly unlike the beefy Briton's ordinary conception of
a Frenchman. He is more vivacious than the average Englishman,
and talks better English—that's all the difference I can see.
Mr. BLAGDEN was trying to convince him last night that the Riviera
of France could not possibly have justice done to it by the Repub-
lican Government of France, and that
the best thing to be done would be to
hand over the region to England to be
administered. The pleasantry — for
that kind of thing passes for pleasan-
try with a man of Mr. BLAGDEN'S
stamp—was particularly misplaced, as
the DE CHAUMONTS have not only
always been distinguished for patriot-
ism and courage, but have for some
years now been warm supporters of
the Republic. But DE CHAUMONT
took it with a perfect tact.
"No," he said; "I cannot agree
with you. We are not ready for the
strong meat of your British institu-
tions. We do best in our own way,
call it frivolous and sometimes childish
if you like, but it is at least a happier
existence for those who are not of the
rich classes. Besides," he added with
a smile, "the careless inhabitants of
that region could never be got to see
the importance of a Diocesan Reform
Bill; they would not vote for it.
Therefore, I think, we will leave
them under the easy disadvantages of
their present government." This was
a delicate rapier-thrust at Mr. BLAG-
DEN, who bores not only the House,
but his acquaintances to death about
his ridiculous Diocesan Reform Bill.
There is an epidemic of marriage
engagements far more violent and
deadly than the influenza. The last
to go has been poor FRANK HATTERS-
LEY, who announces his defeat from
the County Wicklow—a veteran who
has escaped unharmed through a score
of battles struck down, as it were, in
a wretched border foray.
Miss BRUCE has, I think, written
to you herself, so I do not charge
myself with any messages from her. Every word you said about her
is true. Can she and such girls as Miss CRAIK, or the stupid, affected
BLAGDEN couple really belong to the same order of creation? No, a
thousand times no.
Please give my kindest and most affectionate regards to Lady
FINDHORN. How happy she must be at Pentland with you and her
grandchildren. My love to HARRY and MAB. I am leaving this on
Wednesday. As I shall probably not see you before Christmas, I
must content myself with this written wish that it may be a very
happy one for you and yours.
They are returning from church—flushed, triumphant, superior.
In ten minutes we shall be visiting the horses. The model farm will
occupy the afternoon. Farewell. I must collect my thoughts so as

Mr Baronite's opportunities of
reading a three-volume novel are
rare, and precious accordingly. It
is a terrible thing conscientiously
to commence the long journey and
to find the pathway dreary and
the country fruitless. BLACK-
WOOD'S name on the back of a
novel is a sure sign that the
attempt is worth making. The old
Edinburgh house still possesses
the magnetic influence which,
through nearly a century, has
drawn towards it new writers of
desirable kind. Red Cap and
Blue Jacket, by GEORGE DUNN,
just issued, does not fulfil the
most generous expectation. There
are about it indications of the
voung and unaccustomed hand.
It requires the blithe courage of
youth to go back to Paris in the
Reign of Terror for chapters in a
domestic novel. The first volume
conveys the pleasing impression
that the reader is in for a really
good thing. But when he gets to
Paris he shares the desire of
Andrew Prosser and his fellow-
adventurers, and wishes he were
back again. Mr. DUNN'S plot is
of the good old melodramatic
style. Everything fits in a mer-
reille, as ROBESPIERRE used to
say. 'You turn'a'corner and there
you are; in most unexpected com-
pany, but amid the very circum-
stances necessary to carry on the
story. Still, Mr. DUNN'S literary
style is excellent, and he has a
subtle humour occasionally re-
freshing. He will do much better
than this. He may have been
christened ANDREW, bat he is
certainly not yet DUNN.

(Simple Questions and Answers for the Use of Students at Law.)
Question. Suppose that a man is suspected of being insane, and
consequently is unfit to manage his own affairs, what is the proper
thing to do f
Answer. To commence legal proceedings to test his sanity.
Q. What does this entail?
A. The instruction of at least a couple of sets of solicitors.
Q. And what are the consequences of these instructions''
A. The preparations of bnefs, proofs, and the engagement of a
strong bar of counsel.
Q. And are there any further expenses?
A. Why, certainly; the cost of the production of witnesses must
be provided, for, and many other necessary expenses must be incurred.
Q. What next will happen?
A. The case will be heard before the proper authority, and a nearly
double jury.
Q. And will there be a large number of witnesses?
A. On both sides. And, consequently, the case will consume a
large amount of time.
Q. And will the counsel receive refreshers, and the solicitors
gather additional costs?
A. Undoubtedly, and this is a part of the system.
Q. And when the case has been thrashed out by the examination
of witnesses for the prosecution and the defence, may not the Jury
take it into their heads to clear the Court and examine the alleged
lunatic without assistance, and foi themselves?
A. Certainly; and this examination may lead to a prompt decision.
Q. And will not this prompt decision be entirely independent of
the evidence that has been adduced? A. Entirely.
Q. Then will not the whole of the proceeding anterior to this
action of the jury seem absolutely superfluous?
A, Why, certainly. That stands to reason.
Q. Then why not have the examination first, andrtherefore dispense
with the unnecessary ajid expensive preliminaries?
A. Because such a course would be inappropriate to proceedings
so closely associated with insanity!

(COVENT) GARDEN PARTIES.

The Opera-goer's Diary.— Whit Monday.—Opening night of
Opera. Sir DRUEIOL.VNUS cares not a whit—Monday or any other
day—when the Opera Season commences, as long as the date is as
early as possible, in order to give him time to produce his " whole
bag of tricks." So Whit Monday night resulted, in about as full
a house as any Covent-Gardener could possibly have expected to see.
An enthusiastic reception was given to PUCCINI'S opera Manon
Lescaut, performed by the company got together by " the celebrated
Milanese publisher, Signer RICOBDI,"—a pleasant fact which must
be Ric.ordi'd here. Singers all good, and opera pleasing; hut,
considering chance offered by the story and great opportunities, it is
certainly lacking in dramatic power. Of course MASSEXET had
previously taken all the dramatic prints of the story, so there wasn't
much left. Signorina OLGA OLOHINA (quite poetic this name) good as
Manon, and Signer BKDUSCHI, a prettily-voiced lover, as Des Cfrieur.
Little Signer Pixi-CoRsi looked (as GARBICK did when in a passion)
quite six feet high, owing to his excellent performance of Lescaut,
a part in which there are very small chances of doing anything.
The hits of the Opera are the concerted pieces. The intermezzo—
no modern opera now perfect without an Intermezzo— is meant to be
as descriptive as was Lord BUBLEIGII'S portentous shake of the head;
and very necessary information is given in the book. The composer
was called at the end of every act, and came on joining hands with
the singers, "all in a row," as if their original idea had been to
dance in a circle, singing, "Here we go round the mulberry bush."
which, if Sir AUGUSTUS had " taken the flure " in the centre, would
have been a pretty and exhilarating sight. Opera over about ten
minutes to midnight. Congratulations all round; and Sir DRURIO-
LANUS, watching the proceedings from a stall, as if he had nothing
on earth to do with the entertainment, but had just dropped in as
one of the general public, was of course recognised, and ovationed.
Tuesday.—Faust. Reaction after excitement of opening night.
Habitue requires something startling in Faust, and on this occasion
habitue doomed to disappointment. Mile. SIMMONET as Marguerite
rather like " negus" at a children's party, "sweet but not strong."
PLANQON capital as the French Mephisto, and M. ALBEES an ex-

Wednesday.—Real treat. JULIA RAVOGLI as Orpheus (" with his
loot" Eurydice whom he loots from Hades, only to see her expire on
a Bank-holiday) perfect in acting and singing. After last song,
"Eurydice!" curtain up and down several times, audience enthu-

siastic and JULIA joyous! But for the play-bill, who could possibly
guess that JULIA is playing a male part? This talented artiste
might as well play Orpheus in a modern dressing-gown and sandals.
Decidedly over-draped. Beaming BEVIGNANI being gailv deposed,
up comes Merry MANCINELLI to conduct the Cai-alleria Rusticana.

Thursday.—1}i&t charming light 1-rench comic opera Philemon
el Baucis, followed by Pagliacci, wherein Madame SIOBTD ABNOLD-
SON is bewitching as the volatile but unfortunate Netlda, and
Mr. RICHABD GBEEN good as ever in the character of the seductive
villager who plunges into the " wortex," and takes a Nedda into a
sea of troubles. Pagliacci, excellent as it is, is not to be compared
with Rustitana, so I will not compare it. Each of these two operas
holds the audience entranced until the very last note.
Friday.—Strike of Cabmen had nothing to do with the hit of
Carmen made by Madame
CALVE. She is marvellous in
it. Only two things want-
ing, that she should be able
to play the castanets and to
dance a bolero, or a fandango,
or something with some
genuine go in it, just to
suggest the idea of capti-
vating Jose. Whatever fas-
cinations the Carmen of
Madame CALVK has for Jose,
certainly her dancing and her
playing at playing the casta-
nets couldnt have had much
extra effect on the already
enamoured soldier. There is,
just now, no Carmen but
CALVK, and great ought to be
the Profit! M. ALBEBS came
out strong as Escamillo, and
our dear old " Toreador con-
tento" obtained such an encore
as has been rarely heard since
it was first sung and wildly
re-demanded over and over
again.

THE CAB-HIRERS VADE
MECUM.
Question. Why do you take
a cab?
Answer. Because it is my
custom.
Q. Would you not do just
as well without one?
A. Certainly; for I could
either walk, which would be
better for my health, or take
an omnibus, which would be
better for my pocket.
Q. But is not a cab a neces-
sity at a railway station when
a weary traveller arrives
weighted with luggage?
A. Certainly not, for nowa-
days railway companies are
accustomed to provide their
own conveyances, which are
just as convenientl.as four-
wheelers.
Q. What is your opinion of
cabmen'(
A. That they are well able
to look after their own in-
terests.
Q. Then you have not much
sympathy with the recent
stiike?
A. Not much, as cabman
seem always fairly prosperous
and quite equal to obtaining
the living wage.
Q. Has a cab strike any
advantages?
A. Considering that about
half the street accidents are
"running down" cases, the
chances are that a cab strike
is a boon and blessing to the
coroner.
Q. Do you know of any
further advantage?

A. That the chance of th
spreading of infection is les
sened.
Q. But is not the cab strik
very inconvenient?
A. Scarcely, as the suppl
is always equal to the demand
Q. Then who suffers when
the cabmen strike?
A. Presumably the cab
men's wives and children.
Q. And how does the strike
affect the public generally?
A. By teaching them how
to do without them.
Q. Is this satisfactory?
A. To the public, possibly
yes; but to the cabmen dis-
tinctly no.

A BALLADE OF THE NEW MANHOOD.
By an Unregenerate Male.
["Madame GRAND is going to take Caliban in
aand, and make a new man of him. But the
present generation is past praying for. Man has
seen allowed to act on his own 'worst impulses.'
HIB education has been carefully planned to make
lim morally a weak-willed, inconsistent creature.'
. . It is the next generation which is to have
proper principles spanked into it in the nur-
sery.1 "—fall Mall Gazette, May 16.]
YES, it pains me indeed to relate
To the rising male genus the news—
At the terrible thought of their fate
They may shiver and shake in their shoes!
Jor from one of the monthly reviews
It appears they '11 be taken in hand
By the New Womanhood, that pursues
The programme of grim Madame GRAND!
Poor youths! at an imminent date
All the foibles of man they 're to lose;
If one ventures to lie in bed late,
Or latchkeys and "language'' to use,
Or play penny nap, or amuse
His weak wits with aught else that is banned,
He '11 be spanked till for pardon he sues—
Tis the flat of firm Madame QRAND!
Still, there's one fact, I 'm happy to state,
That some consolation endues!
To reform each grown-up reprobate
Is too hard—'tis enough to abuse!
So we men will go on as we choose,
And unlimited Caudle we '11 stand,
And with chastened amusement peruse
The attacks of irate Madame GRAND.
ENVOI.
Mr. Punch, pray do not refuse
To spread through the length of the land
Your decided dissent from the views,
And the plans of severe SARAH GRAND!

"Maid in Germany."
"DULCE RIDENTEM LALAGEN AMABO."
MY love no rhymer cjuld relate
In metrical professions,
Nor gauge by coldly accurate
Numerical expressions,
So passionate it is and strong . . .
And yet. . . can anything be wrong?
I learn—the best authorities
Consistently inform me—
That if malignant fates should please
With evil luck to storm me,
I ought to scorn them all the while,
Content with CHLOE'S charming smile.
Yet, while admitting, after all,
The troubles daily sent us
Are not the kind one well can call,
With truthfulness, momentous,
I find annoyance still in these
Let CHLOE giggle as she please!
When I have hooked the wily trout,
And find that I 've forgotten
The net, and fail to pull him out
Because the tackle's rotten;
Or when, with my accustomed luck
I score the ignominious "duck ;"
Or when, "all square and one to play,"
My ball is bunkered badly,
As much as ever, truth to say,
I rate misfortune madly,
And CHLOE, though my future wife,
Would smile—at peril of her life.
The cause of this I cannot state,
Alternately one fancies
That men are now degenerate
From heroes of romances,
Or that such griefs as we endure
No smiles are competent to cure!

PREHISTORIC PEEPS.
A NOCTCRNK WHICH WOULD SEEM TO SHOW THAT "RESIDENTIAL FLATS" WEPE NOT
WHOLLY UNKNOWN EVEN IN PRIMEVAL TlMES I
THE BUDGET AND THE BAR PROSPECTS.
DEAR SIB,—The Haroourt Budget (a
capital name, by the way, for a new illus-
trated weekly paper) seems to be a great
success. The small income-tax payer rejoices
in the fact that he will pay less next year
under an eightpenny tax than he did last
year under a sevenpenny, and the City Clerk
has, I understand, already celebrated the oc-
casion by buying a new hat, and (I hope) his
wife a new bonnet, though my information on
the latter point is, I am sorry to say, not so
specific. As to the beer and spirit tax, it
would be absurd to suppose that, whatever
duty was put upon these necessities of exist-
ence, we should drink any the less. The
brewers and publicans have, as I gather from
the reports I see in the Press, turned the
occasion to profit by increasing their per-
centage of gain from the modest 100 per cent,
to a percentage of four figures.
It would be insincere, however, to say that
these were the reasons which induce me to
agree that this Budget has placed its author
in the very fir at rank of CHANCELLORS or
THE KVCHKni'Kii, It is one criticism on the
Budget (intended curiously enough, I believe,
to be an unfavourable criticism), which I
noticed fell from the lips of some M.P. or
other, that has appealed to me, and, I venture
to add, to every man, silk or stuff, at the Bar.
"The consequence of the Death Duties
scheme," said the critic, "will be that all
wills will have to be made over again." Could
anything ever dreamt of, ever pictured in the
wildest flights of a luxuriant imagination,
look more like the realisation of a lawyer's
paradise? Solicitors will have to do hurriedly
that which should be done calmly and con-
siderately. His dot out i-itn dot is a capital
maxim, and the legal interpretation of it is
that a lawyer makes twice as much out of a
hurriedly made will as out of one made with
befitting consideration. Where the barrister
comes in will be to conduct the cases in Court
when these wills come to be contested. One
Man's Death Duty will be another man's
living. The Chancery Courts will be abso-
lutely flooded with work, and additional
judges will not merely be agitated for, but
will become a necessity to which no respecting
LORD CHANCELLOR can possibly fail to yield.
In that day my friend BRIEFLESS and myself
will, no doubt, add ourselves to that "Col-
lection of English Silks," which has as its
permanent exhibition ground the front rows
of our Courts.
Now there are many lawyers in the House,
and their votes cannot fail to influence the
prospects of the Budget. After what I have
ilready said, I need say no more. Charity
begins at home. Verbum say.
Yours proverbially,
L. ERNED COUNSEL.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LETTER TO A DEBUTANTE.
MY DEAR GLADYS,—So you
have come to London to spend
TOUT first season with the
LYON TAYMEBS.
I shall be very glad to give
you all the hints I can.
As you have, fortunately,
no convictions, no opinions,
hardly any ideas, ana no de-
cided tastes, it will be the
easiest thing in the world for
you to become extremely popu-
lar. You have merely to fall
in with the notions of other
people, and echo the phrases
you hear. Do not make the
mistake of trying to take a
line of your own.
You say you are rather at a
loss for the small change of
conversation, and you want to
know (for instance) what to
say to an Author whose books
you have not read, an Artist
whose pictures you have not
seen, a Composer, or an Ex-
plorer, of whom you have
never heard.
Generalise. Be cautious. Do
not plunge hastily into some
rash assumption which you
may afterwards regret — a
recklessness that leads to such
dangers as that of telling
Mr. WHISTLES that" Svbbles"
is your favourite of his pic-
tures, or of congratulating
Mr. OSCAR WILDE on the suc-
cess of " Dodo." Say, vaguely,
"I am so interested in your
work, Mr. So-and-so," and
leave him to give information
about it. You will soon learn
how to make people tell you
what they suppose you already
know.
When you meet a writer,
and you are not sure whether he is the author of a burlesque,
or of serious articles for an important review, a safe general
remark for a young girl is, "I am so afraid of you, Mr. So-
and-so; I hear you are so dreadfully clever!" This is one of
those unanswerable speeches that for the moment may cast a slight
gloom over the conversation, but Mr. So-and-so will presently revive,
and it is just possible that you may find out from his remarks whether
he is funny or serious. If you do not. it does not matter.
You may discuss (and warmly) a book you have not read, with
anyone but the author. "The book of the season" is read less than
any other book, because the remarks in vogue are so easily caught up
and repeated. Say that when you have once put it down you could
never take it up again. To the author, say frankly you have not
been able to get it, there is such a rush for it; and do not ask him
to tell you " what gave him the idea," nor how long it took him to
write.
At private views, say to serious people, "What a dreadful crash!
I hate these things! I shall come another day, quietly, to look at the
pictures."
To the flippant, complain that there are so many pictures that you
cannot see the people, and ask to have GLADSTONE pointed out to
you, or CISSIE LOFTUS.
Remember that " argument is the last refuge of the intellectually
destitute."
Never contradict anyone, except yourself. Never correct people
about dates, or names, or any trifle. Never be positive or well-
informed, or have heard a story before.
Never call people names in their preseneet such as "the great
Impressionist, or Symbolist, or New Humourist. They are always
irritated by the string that ties the label on.
Adapt yourself.
If you meet the sort of person (you will) who says that all he cares
about is to bathe his head in God t beautiful sunlight, you may tell
him that you are very highly strung, and " neurasthenic." He will
probably lend you LE GALLIENNE'S Poems, and tell people you are
quite charming.
To the sportsman, laugh at insomnia, and be interested in golf.
PROFESSIONAL SCORN.
Joshua (the new Gardener). "WHO SOWED THEM PKAS, Miss MAUD?"
Mist Maud. "I 'M ALMOST AFRAID / DID, JOSHUA!"
Joshua. "An, I TBOUOBT THEY LOOKED AS IF SOMEONE HAD DONE IT
'ISSXLP.'"
Say, " If Lord ROSEBEBY wins
the Derby, will there be a
dissolution of Parliament?"
If you cannot think of any-
thing better, as a general
remark, you can always say,
"Are you going on?"
Commonplaces are useful
and necessary.
Still, avoid the more flag-
rantly hackneyed, as, for
instance, when the gentlemen
join vou after dinner, "Have
you been settling the affairs
of the nation?"
If you are asked what you
think about ladies smoking,
say it all depends where, how,
and when they do it; thus
implying you would not like
to see a lady smoking a short
pipe in the park on Sunday
morning. But, under certain
circumstances, you may occa-
sionally have your first cigar-
ette. You need not cough,
but laugh a good deal.
To the thought reader, say
you feel sure there is "some-
thing in it," to the Spiritualist,
that there certainly is a good
deal that has never been ex-
plained. Still, be careful not
to appear too deeply interested,
or he might come and explain.
You can make the same
remark over and over again
(as for instance, that one about
"If Lord ROSIBEBY wins the
Derby," <Sbc.) to a dozen dif-
ferent people.
Be economical with your
phrases. It will never be
noticed. Now, I know what
you are thinking. No, GLADYS
dear, you will not be found
out. There is no time. No
one remembers a word you
— • -' say, and very few people listen.
By following the line of conduct I have indicated, you will get a
general reputation of being a particularly nice girl, with a gnat deal
more in her than any one would suppose.
Later on, if a little flirtation should begin, vou had better write to
me again, telling me all about him. Love to Lady TAYMEB.
Believe me, • Your loving IIAKJOEIK.

Wednesday.—Fired, by the enthusiasm of some English critics,
resolve to run over to Paris to see the wonderful WHISTLEB iu the
New Salon. Understand that it excels anything done by VELASQUEZ
or TITIAN. As for such old-fashioned men as REYNOLDS or GAINS-
BOROUGH, they are simply forgotten. True art is so elevating.
Therefore run over.
Thursday.—Delightful in Paris. Brilliant blue sky, glorious sun-
shine; animation, movement everywhere. Glorious sunshine a trifle
hot. Can't possibly go to see the WHISTLER to-day in that great
greenhouse on the Champ de Mars. Sit in the Avenue du Bois and
look at all the pretty Parisiennes. By chance meet that
charming little Comtesse, who is so gay and delightful.
Shall do the New Salon to-morrow.
Friday.—Sky bluer. Sunshine brighter and warmer.
Unfortunate. Did really want to see the chef-d'oeuvre of
modern times. Art is so ennobling! But on a day like
this, and in a greenhouse! Stroll along the Avenue des
Acacias and watch the pretty little dames bict/clisfes in their
knickerbockers. Meet the Comtesse again. WHISTLER
must wait.
Saturday.—Sky if possible bluer. Sunshine decidedly
warmer. Begin to get anxious about that Salon. Must
do it somehow. But art longa in a conservatory in this
weather would make vita very brerit indeed. Can't do it.
Take one of those comfortable little fiacres and drive to
the Bois, and have dejeuner in the open air with the
Comtesse and some friends. Resolve firmly that, what-
ever the weather may be, will do the New Salon to-
morrow.
Sunday.—Last day here. By Jove, it is warm! How
delightful it will be to go out to St. Germain, or somewhere,
and Oh, hang it! There's that sublime WHISTLER.
Must really see it. Give up trip to country air and, in
frock coat and top hat, drive to New Salon. Roasted on
the way. But at least in fresh air. Inside Salon, baked
—without fresh air. Sun blazing on glass roof. Crowds

of bourgeois endimanchet. Pull myself together and, in the inte-
rests of immortal art. resolve to find that WHISTLER. These alpha-
betical catalogues maddening. Never know what room anything is
in. Walk round (rasping. That's a funny figure anyhow. No. 1186.

MANNERS AND CUSTOMS.
(Being a Series of Private Letters on these and other Subjects.)
No. IV.—FROM Miss BRUCE, CRANWELL PASK, SUFFOLK, TO LADY
MABEL HUNTER, PEKTLAND HALL, HANTS.
MY DEAREST MAS, _ December 15, 189—.
Such a disappointment not getting to you and dear Pent-
land! I did so look forward to it, and then to think that this
tiresome visit should clash—yes, tiresome, because it kept me
from you. Though iu itself, I am bound to say, it
is not at all bad! The BLAGBEN girls, whom I
haven't seen since we were at St. Salvador's to-
gether, are kind enough when you don't interfere
with any of their little plans, and Mrs. BLAGBEN is
a dear, the image of your old JACKIE (my best
respects to the estimable Mrs. JACKSON, by the
way), only saved from vulgarity by absolute un-
pretentiousness.
The house party is very cheery; I like Mr.
MAYBEW immensely; we have long talks about
you, and he's never tired of hearing about our
funny time in Eastneuk, when I acted as nurse for
those two pets during JACKIE'S holidays, and we
all shared the "front parlour," where you used to
work at your Greek with the classical mistress from
St. Salvator's, while the chicks and I watched the
golfers at the last hole from that delightful bow-
window. Fancy Mr. MAYBEW never having been at
Eastneuk. nowadays when it is overrun by every-
body, and almost turned into a watering-place,
instead of a dignified university town, known only
to a few elect spirits like yourself, and quiet resi-
dents like ourselves, besides its own professors and
students—as was the case before this dreadful'' Golf
boom," and before our special Poet had written BO
much and so delightfully about it. Mr. MAYDEW
says he means to go next September, if you are
there to do the honours of the dear old place; and
M. BE CHAUMONT wants to come too, if only to see
"this interesting new development, the pioneer of
great public schools for girls, with a similar educa-
tion and physical training to that which boys get at
Eton and Harrow, only of course far superior in
every way. ... I think I must tell my brother,
who is Anglo-mane, to send his little girl to your
St. Salvator's." . . . They are always teasing the
BLAGBENS and me about St. Salvator's since they
got hold of a number of our school magazine, and
read about the cricket-scores and the Lacrosse team
and the house shield and house colours! They pre-
tend to be very much shocked at the girls always
wearing gymnastic suits in the playground, and

very mucn amused at the Latin and Greek; but, as I tell them,
they need not be jocular over that, considering that one of our St.
Salvator girls got a First-class at Oxford or Cambridge, I forget
which, when not a man did!
I don't think much Latin and Greek has stuck to the BLAGDEXS
and me, but then we were good at games; BELLA BLAGBEN was the
best Captain of the Eleven we ever had. She is now Captain of the
Ladies Golf Club near here, by the way • such a good course, dozens
of clubs used, and then, the uniform! green skirt to the ankles,
yellow boots and gaiters, green Tarn o' Shanter, scarlet coat and brass
buttons!! Imagine this on our modest Ladies' Links at Eastneuk,
where we sally forth humbly with our "putter." It's rather a joke
—the Men's Club here don't allow women on to their Links, of
course; while the men are honorary and valued members of the
Ladies Club, equally of course! BELLA BLAGBEN and I are going
to initiate Mr. HAYBEW and the Baron PAUL BE CHAOIOXT into the
mysteries of golf to-merrow. I like both men so much, the Baron
plays Chopin and Schumann as I thought only you could, and he is
so intelligent and responsive—" gey quick at the uptak," as we say
over the_ border. To near him returning Mr. BLAGBEN'S elephantine
chaff with what Mr. MAYBEW calls "delicate rapier thrusts" is
delightful, very. I can't stand Papa BLAGBEN; he revels in plati-
tudes till I feel I could shriek. What ROLLO would
call "an apostle of the obvious;" and oh, so self-
satisn'ed and ostentatious. Ugh!
I never staid in this sort of country-house before;
mother thought it was just to be a quiet time in the
country with my "old school-friend," and so did I;
whereas it's quite a party, and "Well, I've
come to the conclusion that I am dreadfully old-
fashioned, and behind the times, for LUCY BEBKE-
LEY, who is staying here, says this is quite a hum-
drum house compared to the ordinary run; and yet
some of the "goings on" would make mother and
Aunt JEAN'S hair stand on end. We certainly don't
have what LUCY graphically calls "Passage Fun"
(think of it, MABEL !) after the household is sup-
posed to be wrapped in slumber; nor are the
cigarettes passed round to men and women alike at
the table after dessert; but the BLAGBEN girls and
Mrs. MAXWELL certainly are beyond me. I can't
cope with them when they make allusions and tell
stories. I hate it. Mrs. MAXWELL laughs, and says,
"Oh, I minded it, too, once; but you'll soon get
used to it. The best way for a girl is just to make
an idiot face, and pretend not to understand." Well
I don't understand; but I feel it would be dreadful
if I did, and that makes me wretched, and crimson;
and then Captain MAXWELL always manages to get
opposite to me and stare, with a kind of amused grin
that makes me long to slap him with my open hand.
He is a horror, but Mr. M ANTON, of the Foreign
Office, is worse; he looks like a June oyster, and
talks in a little mincing, falsetto voice, that would
make ROLLO or one of the boys at home kick him.
Mrs. MAXWELL says he's a dear thing," and
Captain MAYBEW, who's awfully amusing and
cheery, says he's "a mini." He talks about his
emotions as if they were dresses. "I felt a pink
joy," he said the other night, "and after the drab
misery, shot with purple patches of despair, it
seemed almost a crimson rapture."
Oh, I wish you could have seen Mr. MAYBEW'S
face—it looked more aquiline than ever, and that sort
of clean-shaved curl of the lip ... if Mr. MANTON
"Like a June Oyster."
were not so absurdly tiny and sickly, I think he would have punched
his head. He had another "crimson rapture" last night when LUCY
BERKELEY and Mrs. MAXWELL did a skirt dance in rainbow accordion
skirts—it really was pretty; but then BELLA and DOT BLAGBEN came
on in black dancing skirts and did a sort of stamping and kicking
dance. Dreadful! I can't imagine how nice old Mrs. BLAGBEN could
allow it! but I don't think she 'has any authority over them. Do, do
write to me soon, or if you are too busy with all your guests, ask dear
Aunt JEAN to write me one of her delightful letters; nobody writes
any like them. Fond love to her, and kiss my two darlings; you
know how much love to take for yourself, from your own BETTY.
P.S.—How is ROLLO?

but not Faust-rate; a trifle too
small for the gay and gallant rejuvenated Professor, and not up to
his own height in Pagliacci.
Sir DBUBIOLANCS hard at work rehearsing seven operas, of which
four are brand new. L'Attaque de Moulin will offer a great chance
to " the wind " in the orchestra. The prize-fighting drama did not
make a hit at Drury Lane, but there is every chance for the "merry
Mill" at the Opera.

LINES IN PLEASANT PLACES.

TIGHTLY packed, an hour and a quarter
Inconvenienced by this "mortal coil,"
Gasping like a fish just out of water,
Feeling like a sardine out of oil;
Here I stand before the threshold sighing,
And the minutes—don't exactly fly;
"Pleasant places!" Here my lines are lying —
Someone^s eating peppermints hard by:
Vain to ask a burly country cousin,
"Twixt him and the door securely rammed,
Not to shove enough for half a dozen,
He but grins, and answers, "Yon be

But at last—'tis not in vain I 've waited—
Ope the portals fly, an end to pain;
And I feel, like Faust, rejuvenated,
In the pleasant Pit I breathe again!

doubtless, he will feel
repaid
When, joyfullv complacent,
His name and hers he sees

Within that list adjacent;
His letters will have ceased; instead

Excusably one fancies
That Love has fled to other climes,
So trite are our romances,
It lives! It thrives, in this our age,
Within the daily paper's page!
QUEER QUERIES.—USEFUL DISCOVERY.
—I should be glad to know what is the best
way to approach the War Ofllce with a valu-
able invention? It is a bulletproof coat on
an entirely new principle, far better and
heavier than DOWE'S. I have tried it on a
cat in our back-yard with really surprising
results, and now I want to try it on the
Secretary for War in AM back-yard. But it
seems difficult to interest him in the idea.
Indeed, on the last of my daily visits to the
War Office a policeman was summoned to
remove me! Perhaps the fact that I went in
my patent Impregnable Suiting mounted on
the oack of an elephant—which is the only
animal that seems able to bear the weight—-
may have had something to do with my
reception, especially as a largeand disorderly
crowd if ill accompany me. Why not form a

in force to wait on the Officials! B a Fund

(Composed for tht Use of those

Question. What are the pri-
vileges of a lady?
Ansirer. To do everything
she pleases.
Q. A re there any drawbacks
to this position?
A. Certainly not; because
while a woman can claim
equality with man fhe can
Btill obtain superiority by ap-
pealing to his chivalry.
Q. What is the strength of
woman?
A. The weakness of man.
Q. Is this truism of benefit,
for instance, to a lady on a
journey?
A. Unquestionably, as no
man of right feeling would
forget the deference due to the
weak from the strong.
Q. Then a man and woman
are absolutely equal in theory?
A. Absolutely.
Q. Supposing there were
only one chair and two candi-
dates for it of different sexes
—who would possess it?
A. Why the woman, of
course, at the earnest invita-
tion 6f the man.
Q. Has a woman a right to
enter a smoking-carriage?
A. Yes; although it may
be as well for her to accustom
herself to cigarettes.
Q. But suppose she objects
to cigarettes?

is permitted.
Q. But supposing she in-
sists upon entering a smoking-
carriage.
A. Well then she must make
up her mind to accept the in-
evitable.
Q. And what may that be?
A. Homage to nicotina.
Q. Do you mean smoking?
A. I do, but prefer the other
way of putting it.
Q. But suppose a lady, after
forcing herself into a smoking-
carriage, coughs, and exhibits
other signs of distress.
A. Express sympathy
whilst puffing your cigar.
Q. Then you would not
desist?
A. Certainly not, for smoke
is the friend of man, and is
far too precious to be cancelled
for the joy of receiving a
woman's smiles, to say nothing
of her frown.
Q. Then what is the pro-
bable ending of a woman's
protest raised in a compart-
ment devoted to use of pipes
and cigars?
A. Why, smoke to be sure.
Q. Then what should a
woman remember before utter-

A. That the worm will turn,
and so, on rare occasions, will
the smoker.

A FAIR UNKNOWN.
THE little dark curls stray out below
The little red hood on your brow of snow,
And what is your name I do not know;
But I know you are pretty and brave and
You dainty little lied Riding-Hood, [good,
I might find out, for the world is small,
And even the Bladud fancy ball,
That looks like a living kaleidoscope,
Is studded with those tix'd stars of hope
Who know the who and the what and where
Of plain and ancient, of young and fair.
But I will not learn. For your face and
grace
Shall never be bound by the commonplace,
The definite house in crescent or square,
And life with its social wear and tear.
^But here, with your pretty, homely gown,
Your mitten'd arms ana your stockings brown
You are far away in the fairy wood
Of ages ago, lied Hiding-Hood!
Ah, were you alone in the forest wide
I 'd be a gaunt, grey wolf at your side,
And your steadfast eyes would show no fear
For I would not hurt you, or eat you dear.
But take you safely the wild wood through,
A lovelier Una's guardian true.
The Militant Daughters, of Key and Club,
Whose crown is swagger, whose wit a snub,
They wilt like ghosts at the eye of day
In the simple charm of your sweet array.
And yours is the soul that makes men fight
For the cause that is yours—for the cause of
right.
And the decadent herd may moan and rave,
And leave the temple to dig the grave,

But life will blossom, while maids like you
Will keep men noble and straight and true.
So I won't escape from the waltz I hate
With that unconversational heavy-weight.
And duty-dances I '11 gaily do
All for the love of unknown you.
And here you come on a warrior's arm,
With a little flush for an added charm.
And merrily off you go to sup
While my penalty waltz is striking up.
Good-bye I To duty I firmly go—
And what is your name I shall never know;
But life is no longer a wolfish wood;
But a shrine for yon, little Red Riding-Hood.

pretty faces, combined to make up a function

was heard to murmur, at the sight of the
magnificent roses, "Yes, it's ROSEBERY,

THE OPERA-GLASS.
HERE I sit, profoundly sad,
It would make the meekest
mad;
Though my eyesight is not bad,
Can I see
From the balcony's last row?
Pretty girls go to and fro
On the stage, but they bring no
Joy to me.
They are pretty I am sure,
Yet I silently endure
Woe for which there seems no
cure;
I have left
My binoculars behind,
Grievous is my state of mind,
Of these maiden's charms I find
I 'm bereft.
One seems quite divinely
fair,
In the distance over there,
Lovely face and golden hair
Catch my eye;
Graceful figure, slender waist,
Dress, though scanty, chic in
taste,
limbs so elegantly placed,
I descry.
If I had my glass to see
All her charms, how nice for
me!—
What a duffer I must be!
I forgot
Automatic cases fall
Open when you place a small
Sum—a shilling, that is all—
In the slot.

A STRIKING ATTITUDE.
PATIENCE ON A TRUNK WAITING FOR A CAB.
How I rush to one of these,
Past the other people's knees!
Though they frown with looks
that freeze,
I don't care;
For my brain is in a whirl,
I shall see that lovely girl,
That bright jewel, peerless
pearl,
Over there!
Fit the focus to the view;
Hang this glass, it's far from
new!
How I fumble with the screw;
Is it smashed?
That's the charmer. No, it's
not,
Some old woman I have got.
Yes, it is, though. Oh! Great
Scott!
Well, I 'm dashed!
I am staggered at the sight.
Why, the woman is a fright!
Distance lent enchantment—
quite
Hid the paint.
Black above, beneath each eye!
Golden hair—a wig, or dve!
Slender waist—stays!" Oh!''
I cry.
Feeling faint.
Then the glass falls with a
crash
On the floor, a total smash;
From the hateful place I dash;
As I pass,
An attendant stops the way,
With a civil air, to say, [_ pay
"There's ten shillings, Sir, to
For the glass."
AT THE NEW GALLERY.
As an Impressionable, am easily affected by omens; a sneeze in
my right ear, a vulture alighting on my left arm, compel me to
laughter or tears for entire dav. Judge of my feelings on entering
this Gallery when I detected inauspicious raven seated to my left
on terra-cotta of Minerva, as in EDGAR POE'S
story. This is No. 412, and may be named
The Ditsulute Bird; or, the Raven on the
Bust. Unmanned by Ibis, was further de-
jected by No. 6 ("After Music"). Time of
day is P.M., or Post Jfttiieam, and a coolness
has sprung up between the two players, due
to absence of clothes and fact that one of them
has been playing flat; though we shall never
know which.
If I were lady in "A Gift for the Gods"
(No. 47), should never think of walking back-
wards to temple down those perilous steps.
In No. 57 we have Mr. DONALDSON'S Me-
dieval Miracle Play." Have myself studied
DONALDSON on Greek Theatre, and hope
archaeology of picture is more correct. Had
I been of the period, should have used strong
language about head-gear of ladies in front
row of stalls.
As for boy in " The White Cow" (No. 109),
I know that boy: he comes from the New
English Art Club; was hay-harvesting there
when I saw him, and showed perfect fever for
it. Have myself been victim of hay-fever,
and worn just this expression. Looking at
"Ariadne" (No. 114), can half guess why
she was deserted in favour of the second Mrs.
Bacchus. By happy tench of colour, artist
shows her marooned on desolate island. No, 33- A Lift on with her new CoTcr-coat.
Am arrested by a series of archaic works.
"The Burning of King Hakon" shows us inflammatory old gentle-
man putting out to sea, with painted shields and dead horse, beyond
possible reach of tire-brigade; sail up, with '' prehistoric peep" on it;
one porpoise, two whales, and five seals, to say nothing of gulls, float
round, awaiting eventualities. Have idea that seditious allegory
underlies this work. President, with row of pictures by Acade-
micians all round him, is being sacrificed on altar of New English
Art; specimen of whose devices floats boldly on ship's canvas. To
talk of burning, besides that of his Majesty, there is the conflagra-
tion of "Mrs. Reginald Smith" (No. 201), who is seen standing in

grate, about to commit arson de se. Should have expected Mr.
COLLIER to better understand igneous charac-
ter of coal.
Second example of archaic period is " The
Mermaids' Rock" (No. 199). Gentle-hearted
Naiads act as buffer between ship's ram
and nasty bit of reef. Kindly purpose lost on
antediluvian mariners, who wok possessed.
However, have been in boat myself, and
know that one does not under these conditions
look one's best. Third of series is same artist's
"Strangers on a Strange Shore." Seem so,
certainly; anyhow, do not appear to be at
home with their ship. Bo'sen on poop seen
leaning on figure-head, and nipping beak of
prehistoric bird, while he signals to another
stranger, half-a-brick's-throw off. Break
forthwith into rhyme as follows:—
punt!
On, on, my bold seaworthy
Run up before the wind!
With a well-tanned pinafore in front,
And a semaphore behind.
Cannot overlook balcony. Many interesting
things happen "In a balcony." Forinstance,
"The Commemoration of Adonis." Have
witnessed a "Commem." often in remote
period when I was a young Adonis; but do
not remember my friends' sisters and cousins
wearing quite the costume here depicted. Am
getting a little tired of Mr. SCHMALZ'S new
dark model of the many names. Her left
profile is called "Lucile" (No. 347). At a three-quarter view,
answers to "Janette" (No. 343). To right is known as "Nina"
(No. 143), and at full length joses as "A Gift for the Gods"
(No. 47), which is short for Theodora. By any other name she
would do as well; perhaps better.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
"GOT HIS MONEY ON" AT THE GARRICK.
THERE 's something attractive in the title of Money. It looks
well. Bills are always a difficulty, but when every bill, that is
every playbill, is more than covered by Money, the result ought to
be satisfactory to the monied management. Therefore may the omen
be good for the Garrick Theatre, where, as all theatre-goers are by
this time aware. Money, BFLWER LYTTON'S comedy, has been
revived. I should like to have seen it in "the costume of the

ANXIOUS MOMENT.
Sir John Jl'/ieezy (to Lady Franliliii-Ilanci'off). "Well,—um—hero we
are again, with Money."
Lady Franklin-Bancroft. "Yes—and ' What will we do with it ?'"
period" to. which it belonged; but Dh aliter mum, and so Money
(as far as costume goes) has been changed, and brought "up to
date" with a few touchings-up of the dialogue, a little introduction
here, and a considerable omission there, with the result that the old
wine doesn't burst the new bottles, but, being adroitly mixed, and
craftily qualified, is offered as a very pleasant beverage to the public.
Mr. I ORBES-RoBERTSos deserves all praise for making that
hitherto insufferable prig Erclyn acceptable, and, as far as such a
character possibly can be, interesting. Miss KATE ROBKE does the
same wi'h that melancholy Clara Douglas. ARTHUR CECIL is a
Bab-Ballady sort of Graces, but the scene between him and Mrs.
BANCROFT as Lady Franklin, of course, goes immensely.
How doth the little Mrs. B.
An audience delight!
She helps to "make " eo merrilee
HAKE'S Money everynight.
As for Sir Jons HARE as Mr. Vesey, no, Mr. JOHN HAKE—quite
white HARE—as Sir John Vesey, he is admirable. True comedy,
every bit of it. Mr. BOUKCHIER as Lord Glossmore, and Mr. KEHBLE
as Stout, who might be a typical County Councillor, are capital;
but Captain Deadly Smooth must have disappointed Mr. BROOKFIELD.
To adapt an ancient proverb, we hope that "Money makes the
Hare to grow," and that at the end of the run, by the time the
Pinerian, or the Grundian, or the Jonesian piece be readv, the
manager and lessee, two single gentlemen rolled into one, will find
that Money has gone well, and that there is a handsome profit
left. So during this run of the revival the Garrick may be tempo-
rarily named Le Theatre de la Monnaie.
QUEER QUERIES.
HONOURS FOR WORKMEN.—Is it true that a knighthood has just
been given to a common pitman connected with a colliery in the
North? If so, it is far the best thing Lord ROSEBERY has done yet.
Why should not every navvy have a handle to his name? I would
give every workman a C.B. at once, and the best workers in each
trade a K.C.B. This would really be something like " the dignity
of labour." At the same time of course I hold that all titles are
wretched shams, and should be instantly abolished. P.8.—A friend
ti-lls me that it is a Mr. PITMAN who has been knighted, and not a
collier, and that he is a man " who has never gone down a pit in his
life, unless when they were short-handed." Can it really be the case
that the Government has thus gone out of its way to honour a person
who must evidently be some mere aristocratic loafer P The true facts
would oblige GENUINE DEMOCRAT.
SUGAH AND MUSCLES.—I saw in the papers some fellow said the best
way to divilope the mussles was to eat lots of sugar. I think it must
be true because he was a Doctor. I want to divilope my mussles,
awfully, because I want to win the mile at our school, and lick that
beastly bully SNOOKS SENIOR. So I tried eating half-a-crown's
worth of Barley Sugar straight off at our Tuck Shop. It didn't
make me a bit more muskular, it only made me sick, and SNOOKS
boxed my ears for being a " sneak and a pig." Please will someone
say what sweets have most sugar in them? I like toffy awf ally-
would toffy do? How much of it should I have to eat to be able to
kick SNOOKS SENIOR all round our playground ?—AUGUSTUS.
THE MAN BEHIND THE GUN.
[" A bond of affection existed between the navies of England and America,
and they were always glad to reciprocate the good feeling exhibited towards
them by the British Navy. Nobody had said a word on behalf of JACK, the
roan behind the gun; but he was as good as he ever waa, and blood was
the thing that told."—Sear-Admiral Erben, in response to the toast of
"The Initeii States Navy" at the Banquet given at St. James's Hall to
tht Officers of the U.S. Cruiser " Chicago.1']
Mr. Punch loquitur :—
GOOD ERBEN, good! You 've hit my mood,
And also hit the mark.
Punch loves all craft, afore and aft,
Right down from Noah's Ark.
A ship to him means pluck, smart trim,
Loyalty, love, and tun;
But.Sir, you bet, he '11 not forget
"The Man behind the Gun!"
Thanks, Admiral E., for teaching P.
That neat and telling phrase!
He joins full heart, for his poor part,
In all that mutual praise
Poured freely out 'twixt sailors stout,
But that which " oops the bun"
Is your sound crack about brave JACK,
"The Man behind the Gun!"
Yes; he's the chap who, hap what hap,
Will keep our Flags afloat.
JOHN, JONATHAN (each sailormiin
Is " JACK" aboard a boat!)
Briton or Yank, whate'er his rank,
All know what has been done,
'Neath Cross or Star, by plain Jack Tar,
'' The Man behind the Gun I"
Yes; guns grow big, and build and rig
Are changed since NELSON'S time.
Huge iron pots and spanking shots
Spoil beauty and floor rhyme.
But when we close with fighting foes,
We '11 find, ere all is done,
We '11 still depend on our old friend,
"The Man behind the Gun!"
Captain MAHAN* is just the man
To prove that ERBEN 's right.
Iron or oak, ships are " no joke,"
But " flesh and blood" must fight.
Your "hundred tenner" is a stunner;
Yet fights will still be won.
If won they are, by stout Jack Tar,
"The Man behind the Gun!"
Fair breezes waft your U.S. craft,
(Cruiser Chicago,) still!
Valour and wit still keep us knit
In brotherly goodwill!
MAHAN, let's liquor! Blood is thicker
Than water. So my son,
A bumper brim all round to him—
"The Man behind the Gun!"

JOAN LA PucELLE.—It is
said that this heroine is to
be canonised. Quite befit-
ting a military heroine that
everything should be ac-
cording to cannon law. At
present, so it is stated in
the Weekly Register ."the
Maid" has only achieved
the title of "Venerable."
This may be an ecclesias-
tically polite way of put-
ting it, but it does sound
uncommonly like calling
her "The Venerable JOAN:
or, Old Maid of Orleans!"
No pleasanter person than
an old maid, but still, some-
how, it is not the rule asso-
ciated with the modest but
militant JOAN.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons. Monday, May 21.—A pleased smile lighted
up HIBBERT'S grave face when he took his seat on Treasury Bench
at half-past three, and looked round on empty benches. Whitsuntide
holidays over; work begins again to-day; Civil Service Estimates
first order; axiom of long standing at Treasury that the fewtr
Members present the more votes. Exceedingly few Members on
view at this moment; arqal, there should be votes by the handful.
No sign of activity on Front Opposition Bench. PRINCE ARTHUR
comes not, nor JOKIM either.
As usual in such circumstances, JEMMY LOWTHKR to the fore.
Drops into seat of absent Leader, and endows Front Bench with im-
posing air of respectability and responsibility. He may have some-
thing to say on the successive votes, HIBBERT musingly admits, but
will be satisfied when he has shown new generation of Members how
their elders used to spesk.
Whilst the Financial Secretary looked on content, a tall figure
strode up the almost empty House; seated itself at corner of second
bench above gangway. This was ROBERT WILLIAM HANBURY.
"Um!" said HIDBEKT, slightly contracting his brows.
Five minutes later there rolled up the passage a short, stout gentle-
man, with one hand in trowsers pocket. Looked as if he had got a
coin there he was intent upon depositing in the National Penny
Hank. Tlin was GKOKOR CnittsToniER TROUT BARTLEY.
"Ah!" said HIBBEKT, the pleased look that had erewhile
illumined his kindly face giving place to one of uneasiness.
The moments sped. Preliminary business rattled through at
exhilarating speed. Ten minutes sufficed to pass second reading of
Bill accelerating Registration of Parochial Electors. Only four
o'clock. Yet a little while, and SPEAKER would be got out of Chair,
and the rattling through of votes might commence. House
still almost empty. HIBBERT looking round to assure himself, his
eye fell on sprightly figure smartly advancing, diffusing subtle
aroma of the briny ocean, impelling suggestion of the whistle of the
wind in the shrouds, the surge of the sea at the bows.
It was Cap'en TOMMY BOWLES.
"Oh!" groaned HIBBERT, sitting limp on Treasury Bench with
hands fallen hopeless at his side, the ashy paleness of despair
gathering over his expressive countenance.
Felt all was over; dream of placid evening with its piled-up votes
vanished. Nor was his sorrow lightened as the slow hours sped.
HANBURY spetdily led off- BAHTLEY blandly backed up his objec-
tions; Cap'en TOMMY filled up any occasional interval; whilst from
the other tide ALPHEUS CLEOFHAS MORTON benevolently dropped
"h's" over the group, threatening to bury it in the agglomeration.
Business done.—Eight hours talk and three votes.
Tuesday.—Exhilarating night making speeches round second
reading Scotch Local Government Bill. Sort of nicht wi' BURNS,
only none of us, not even THE MACGREGOR, dropped into poetry. That
eminent Scot did not, indeed, even succeed in carrying out his fixed
intention of contributing a short stave in prose. This was frustrated
by interposition of that envious Southron the SQUIRE OF MAXWOOD,
On an occasion like present, when interests of Scotland absorb
attention, THE MACGREGOR very properly thinks it his duty to
assume judicial attitude. Let others, in whatever part of the House
they sit, from whatever district of the kingdom they hail, freely
state their views. THE MACOREGOR, enthroned above Gangway, with
arm carelessly thrown over back of Bench, and air of supernatural
wisdom lightening his countenance, and appreciably illumining
Members in immediate vicinity, carefully listens. When others have
made an end of speaking, and the question is about to be put, THE
MACGREGOR slowly rises, and, nodding encouragingly towards the
Chair, observes, "Mr. SPEAKER, one or two ideas occur to me."
This, or Home cognate phrase, invariably acts as cue for the
SQUIRE OF MALWOOD. To-night it was close on midnight when THE
MACGREGOR consented to give listening Senate advantage of his

carrying Debate on to second night. But, as DONALD MACFARLANE '•• To-night average struck. LUBBOCK commissioned to lead heavy

admits, Scotch Members are, after all, almost human. A dour
race, unaccustomed to yield to circumstance, not a man among them
would have raised his voice if its utterance would have secured
avoidance of another such night. They would have doggedly pressed
on. and some might have survived a second night. Nevertheless, if
a Minister insisted on bringing the dreary business to conclusion,
it was not for them to fly in face of Providence.
The SQUIRE'S quick eye glancing round took in the situation. THE
MACGREGOB, having slowly swung himself into position, had just
opened his mouth when the SQUIRE (so to speak) put his foot in it.
In other words, he moved the Closure.
"I consider that very shabby conduct," said THE MACGREGOB, and
wrapping his tartan round him, relapsed into a statuesque silence
more impressive than other people's word.
That nothing should be lacking to completion of Scottish character
of night ROBERT THRESHIR REID, commonly called BOB, sat on the
Treasury Bench tilling his new character as Solicitor-General.
Everyone glad to see him there. BOB as popular in the House of
Commons as " BOBS " is in the Army. Only, LOCKWOOD says, as far
as the Scotch night was concerned, BOB is an imposter.
"ROBEBT THBESHIE," says FRAUK, Q.C.. is no Scotsman at
all. He was really born at Corfu, and to this day, when neither
Court nor House H sitting, he has the Corfu hell rung at home
every night at eight o'clock."
But that's only professional jealousy.
Business done.—Scotch Local Government Bill read a second time.
Thursday.—Tide suddenly returned; filled every nook and cranny
of House. When MUNDELLA rose to explain reasons for resigning
Presidency Board of Trade, not anywhere an empty seat; a throng
at the bar; a crowd in the side galleries.
Task undertaken by MUXDEI.I.A one that tries a man. He came
well out of ordeal; said the right thing in the right way. House
brigade in renewed charge on motion to go into Committee. General
commanding had reckoned without the naval contingent. LUBBOCK
hardly opened fire when the CAP'EN steamed up, and took charge of
the order of battle. The CAP'EN spends his nights and days with
ERSKINE MAY. That eminent authority's Parliamentary Procedure
is his pillow by night, his light refreshment by day. Ever he over-
hauls the wollum, and from time to time makes a note, to SQUIRE OF
MALWOOD'S discomfiture. Just when Ministers, after long struggling,
think they have piloted a bill into harbour, the CAP'EN appears in
the offing, runs up the black flag, and rams home "a point of
order, Sir."
To-night he has dominated the scene. Difficult to decide whether
more terrible in morning dress, with volumes of books on Consti-
tutional Law under either arm, or after dinner, with a white shirt
front that made FIELD green with envy; in his button-hole, the
red flower of sanguinary intent. Committee got altogether out of
hand. SQUIBE could not lead it, nor could PBIHCE ARTHUR restrain
it. The CAP'EN appeared after dinner with fresh Amendment.
MELLOR, wringing his hands in despair, brought unwonted tears to
hardened eyes bv his protest against custom of abruptIv thrusting
upon him not always legibly-written Amendments, and expecting
him, amid conflicting duties of Chair, to decide on their bearing
upon the Bill, and upon a hundred collateral Amendments. PRINCE
ARTHUR besought CAP'EN to withdraw his Amendment in favour of
one standing in name of DICK WEBSTER. Not he. Greatest respect
for ex-Attorney-General; but really knew more about this business
than that eminent authority. Then blameless BARTLEY interfered;
motions for progress hotly made. SQUIRE cuts up rough. Cheers,
and counter cheers; divisions, and more divisions; and no progress
made. Business done.—Got into Committee on Budget Bill.
Friday.—House hears to-day, with keen pleasure, that everything
is going on well with Mr. G. after the operation on his eyes. Not

all reverence, be performed by an expert in the

will help to insure peace, respect, and happiness to

MY DEAR OLD CHAP, January -Uh, 189—.
I went round to your diggings to-day to have a talk with

body thought ne had forgotten." I give you
my word I 'm surprised myself when I think
of it. Nobody was surer than I was that that
blessed song had gone out of my head, words
and music, never to come back again.
Well, to make a long story short, here's
what has happened. It's money, of course—
you '11 have gathered that—but I tell you now,
so that you mav not think there's anything
worse; though I 'm hanged if I know what is
worse than a money fix. When I left Eng-
land I had a vague sort of notion I had got
square, settled everything and everybody, and
got my new leaf staring me in the face. Of
course I hadn't. One never has. There's
always some sentence in the old leaves that
requires your attention, and vou've got to
turn back and go through it all again. Any-
how, letters and bills came popping in—some
of them even got as far as Kashmir, where I
couldn't even use them as pipe-lights, having
lost one pipe and broken the other. However,
they didn't trouble me much till I got back
here two months ago. Then I began to reckon
them up just for the fun of the thing, and
found they mounted to what's called a re-
spectable total—£550, not a penny less. Since Ihen I 've managed
to heap up another £800, racing and card-playing, complicated

with Moss ABRAHAMS, that infernal soapy-voiced, oily-faced,
hypocritical little Jew money-tout. I daresay you know the
beast: he's always pretending to be so extraordinary generous
and agreeable, such a deuce of a gay, light-hearted, reckless
plungert that, by Jingo, he actually takes you in for a bit until
you're in the beggars clutches. Then the trouble begins. He's
found out that my prospects aren't quite so good as ne thought
them, and he's beginning to show his teeth.
Of course he pretends that he himself
wouldn't be disagreeable for millions, but
that the matter has got partly out of his
hands, and that he himself is any amount
hard up, and doesn't know where to turn
for money. You know the kind of game these
chaps play. Anyhow, I'm pretty certain the
brute won t renew even if I asked him—which
I shan't. My dear old VICTOR, will you help
a lame dog over a stile. I know I 've no right
to ask you, and if you say you can't do it—
why I shall know you can't, and you needn't
trouble to give me any reasons. But I don't
want to ask the dear old Governor again.
He's ill, and, if I can possibly help it, I
don't want to make him worse with my follies.
You'll say I ought to have thought of all
that before. Quite true, so I ought, and no-
body knows that now better than I do. But
I tell you, VICTOR, I 'm sick and tired of this
business, of all the gang of silly, rowdy fools
and painted women, and Jews and racing men
and would-be smart people. I don't think it 'a
a case of when the devil was sick, &o. I do
really mean to chuck the whole concern, and
never pick it up again. But you know what a
fellow feels like when he's got a mill-stone
round his neck in the shape of accumulated
debts. He plunges, and naturally enough
down he goes deeper and deeper.
There you are. If you can give me a lift
I 'm sure you will. I 'm not going to spin
long sentences about gratitude; and, in fact,
you know that, come what may, nothing can
ever alter our friendship.
It was awfully nice, seeing so much of you at

THEY were in consultation behind the Speaker's Chair, and it was
three o'clock or thereabouts. They had their hands full of papers,
and anxiety was on all their brows. It was a moment of intense in-
terest, of overwhelming doubt.
"I can quite appreciate that infected
cattle imported from abroad must be most
injurious to the agricultural interest at
home," said one of the Ministers; "but
what has that to do with the chances of
Sullingdon beyond that the first syllable
of the name is distinctly suggestive of
success."
"I do not believe in omens nor yet in
coincidences," returned he who was re-
sponsible for the country's revenue; '' but
the fact that when Mr. LOWE was Chan-
cellor of the Exchequer his financial
arrangements were jeopardised by a strike
of match girls, inclines me to believe that
those who supported Matchbox in spite
of all appearances did not act entirely
unreasonably. That is my contention,
and I have given the matter even more thought than I have disposed
upon the Death Duties."
"The cavalry manoeuvres this year, as I have already said, will be
most interesting," put in a Minister of military appearance; "and
as my department naturally deals with all matters equestrian, I
cannot blame myself for having accorded to the claims of Galloping
Dick adequate attention."
"I fancy it will not be contested that since I have influenced the
Irish Government from the lodge of the Chief Secretary," observed
another; "that the Emerald Isle has had her fair share from the horn
of plenty. So, without being superstitious, I can find apologies for
the deep interest I took in Hornbeam at one period of its career."
The hands of the clocks slowly moved, at length a special messenger
rushed up to them. "Who's won ?" they cried with one voice.
_ The messenger gave the required information. Then there was a
sigh of relief, and the Ministers returned to business with emotions
of a varied character.

SOMETHING IN NAMES.—In conjunction with another defendant,
one FEED STANTON. a Miss VESA HOPE, was charged at Bow Street,
on remand, with obtaining money by falsely pretending to provide
young women with theatrical engagements. Both "YERA" and
''HOPE" are attractive names. "VERA" suggests "Veracity,"
and, without "Hope," how impossible would be everything in life 1
But, in this instance, "Hope" seems to have "told a flattering
tale," and thereby bade farewell to joy!

the poor carriage-horses are most cruel. She does not know who
Mr. BARING was, but he might easily have found a better employ-

consideration (only not too "deliberate,"—say a week, and then
let him act in accordance with Mr. Punch's wishes) to the rides and
drives which ought to be made, for the benefit of equestrians and
vehicularians, across Kensington Gardens, from south to north, i.e..
from South Kensington to Bayswater. Rotten Row should be extended
on the southern side of the Serpentine in a nor'-westerly direction,
so that the jolly young Bayswatermen on their gallant hacks might
have the advantage of a short cut into Rotten Row, under the shade
of some of the finest old spreading trees that London can produce, and
that Paris, with all its lovelv Bois and its beautiful pale greeneries,
cannot equal. These great improvements, as has been over and over
again pointed out to " the authorities," could be effected without any
danger to nursemaids and their charges, and without any sort of
deprivation to the lounging or hurrying pedestrian. No'. the parks
can be opened to a motly, noisy, rampaging crowd, with carts and
platforms that damage the grass and its own cause at the same time,
but not an effort is made on behalf of the convenience, enjoyment,
and healthful recreation of law-abiding citi/ens with a seat in the
saddle, and, perhaps, in the House, who are loyal to QUEEN and
country, who love their London, and who wish, by gentle equestrian
exercise, to support, to the greatest possible advantage, tneir own
British Constitution. Let us begin with such improvements as these
in Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park, and then it will be time to
consider what can be done in the same direction with the other
Un-open Spaces.

WHEN lovely woman tries to volley,
But finds that men refuse to play,

To fascinate the tardy lover,
And gain his favour is—to Golf.

"Hop-Scotch." At the same dinner there were some green grapes

"PLACE AUX DAMES."
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—On Friday, the 1st of June, there was a dinner
at which only literary ladies were allowed to be present. As every
one was bound over to secrecy, of course I cannot divulge the topics
of conversation that were discussed during the course of the evening.
Those of your sex who have been privileged, on account of their
extreme youth, or for other merits, to "J9in the ladies" at times when
"the gentlemen have been left over their wine," may possibly be in
a position to judge of the intense interest of the woman's talk on the
occasion to which I am referring. It may be that the bills of the
butcher, the baker, and the candlestick-maker came under review.
It is not impossible that the merits of this person's gowns and
that person's toupes found advocates both for the defence and the
prosecution. It is not incredible that children's ailments were con-
sidered, and the difficulty of obtaining a satisfactory servant faced
and mastered. Of course I cannot say whether cigarettes were ad-
mitted, nor can I tell you whether ginger beer was more popular
than soda water, or champagne was preferred to lemonade. All
these details must be reserved until the time arrives when one of the
fair diners decides to publish her reminiscences. And this is not
very likely to come oft just at present, as everyone knows that the
autobiographer commences his account of his career by giving the
date of hui birth, a proceeding that would certainly, and very
properly, be unpopular amongst ladies. However, if I must not tell
you anything about the matters upon which I have touched, or
rather to which I have referred, I can make at least one admission,
and, when I make it, I think I shall be supported by the vast
majority of those who were present on Friday last. The Literary
Ladies' Dinner of the 1st of June only needed one feature to be abso-
lutely perfect—the presence of gentlemen.
Yours cordially,

he was badly hurt, but I do so
hate a row that I didn't stop
to find out. Then, in going
down a steep hill the brake
(or is it break ?) wouldn't act,
and I ran into a policeman at
the bottom, and upset him.

THE CONSISTENT CYNIC'S VADE MECUM.
(Specially prepared for the Derby Day.)
Question. What is your opinion of the
Derby?
Answer. That it is an intensely over-rated
race; immeasurably inferior to many others
with but a tithe of its popularity.
Q. What do you think of people who take
the trouble to see it decided at Epsom'(
A. That they must be suffering from tem-
porary insanity.
Q. But is it not pleasant to go down to the
races by road?
A. Unquestionably no. If it rains the
discomfort is sufficiently marked, and if it is
fine the dust is insupportable. Besides, the
humours of the streets have departed. The
drive down is as cheerless as a journey to a
suburban cemetery.
Q. Then you prefer travelling on the rail-
way?
A. On the contrary; on account of the im-
menie crowds, who light for admission at the
doors of the carriages, I can scarcely imagine
a less agreeable route.
Q. But you cannot go by water, and if you
charter a balloon it runs into money—am I
not correct in the assumption?
A. Yes; and therefore I shrink from visit-
ing Epsom when the road is dismal, the trains
are inconvenient, the river is impossible, and
the atmosphere is (after taking everything
into consideration) impracticable.
Q. And what do you think of "aDerby
snack"?
A. Merely a premium upon indigestion.
Q. And are you opposed to the consumption
of "a Derby luncheon"?
A. On behalf of the non-medical public
"Yes "; on behalf of the doctors I can
imagine nothing more beneficial to the finan-
cial side of their profession.
Q. But surely you see no harm in the club
sweep?
A. On the the contrary, it is a snare to the
thoughtless, a lure to the extravagant, and a
disappointment to almost everyone.
Q. But if in the drawing you find yourself
in the possession of the first favourite, would
not such an occurrence cause a modification
in your opinions ¥
A. No; because principles are not affected
by events; and it might happen too that the
favourite might be scratched at the last
moment.
Q. Then, if you were an employer, you
would give no holiday to your subordinates
on the Derby Day?
A. Certainly not. On the contrary, I
would take care that even customary leave
should, on that particular occasion, be
abolished.
Q. And you approve of the House of
Commons meeting on the 6th of June, Derby
Day or no?
A. Most assuredly; and it seems to me an
absolute scandal that the House of Lords
docs not follow the example set in another
and a better place.
Q. And it is your deliberate opinion
A. I beg pardon, but I have no more time
to answer questions.
Q. Why not P
A. Because, in company with a numerous
party of fellow-travellers, I have to catch a
train to Epsom.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE OPERA-GOER'S DIARY.
__ Tuesday and Friday.—Two single nights rolled into one very fat
Knight—Falstaff. Falstaff, personally, is sufficient to fill several
stalls, yet this present deponent, having seen Falstaffs not a few,
is unable to call to mind any one of them, save MARK LEMON, who
did not look just exactly what he was, a stuffeditigure. The stage
Falslaff's portliness is always unreal, his swagger is conventional,
his voice is forced: neither singer, nor actor, can ever be SHAKSPEARE'S
Sir John Falstaff; and though Signor VERDI may stuff him with
notes, yet the fact remains that Falstaff is a very heavy person, and
that the best scenes in VERDI'S Opera are just those in which either
the_Fat Knight doesn't appear at all, or is only of about the same use
as is a football in a scrimmage, and is being hustled about here,
shoved away there, and finally jammed into the notable buck-basket,
to disappear over the balcony and fall splosh into the river below.
As said game of football cannot get along without the object of the
kicks, so 'tis with the dramatic portion of the Opera of Fahtaff,
for its principal character is to the other dramatis personcr what the
football is to the players. Much of the music is delightful, but
of SHAKSFEAEE'S creation. Why should this Op-erratic Fahtaff
"give" at the knees, and shuffle in his walk?
Sir DRURIOLAJTCS has done everything for the Opera, and the last
scene is most effective. By the way, as the masquerade in the
Forest was got up at a few hours' notice by Mistresses Ford, Page,
and Quickly, what a very extensive circle of female acquaintances
they must have had in the town and immediate neighbourhood of
Windsor to enable them to assemble so large a party at such very
short notice! And how fortunate that all these ladies, presumably
merry wives, merry cousins, merry nieces, merry sisters, and merry
aunts, belonging to highly respectable burghers' families in and
about Windsor, happened, not only to be disengaged, but also to
possess, ready for use, these very fairy dresses, without which the
whole idea might have resulted in a sad fiasco for the Merry Wives.
If ENRY HAUTHOR JONES hadn't thought of it first, SHAKSPEARE
might have called his play The Masqueraders.
Thursday.—Madame Anna made her first appearance here as
Valentine, not Marguerite's brother, but the heroine of the Hugue-
nots. Much applauded. Her duet with Marcel acclaimed enthu-
siastically. JI'PITEB PLANIJON (uncommonly like Plain-song in

"EEVEKENZA!"
rarely catching; not from beginning to end is there a phrase in it BO
immediately taking as is that well-known one in the overture to The
Merry Wires of Windsor. There is a taking Nonette in the first
Act; but, to sum up, the Second Scenes of both Acts take first places,
and the Opera is more a success for the orchestra than for the singers
as either vocalists or actors. Occasionally it occurred to me what
either of our two humoristical composers, yclept SULLIVAN or SOLO-
MON, might have done with this subject. Sur,LivAN-cum-SoLonoN
would have made a magnificent work of it. The orchestration is
full of VERDI'S fun, and this brought to my mind the work of
both our English composers. Signora GIULIA RAVOGLT, as Dame
Quickly, with little to do or to sing, makes so much of it, that
when she is on the stage, the time passes Quickly, and the Opera
"goes." The eccentric characters, Dr. Caius.Mardolph, Pistol,
well played and sung by Messrs. ARMANDI, PELAGALLI-KOSETTI,
and ARIMONDI, are capitally made up. Signor PESSINA makes quite
an Italian Falstaff, with such airs,—more or less taking,—graces
and pantomimic action as are not associated with the English idea
English), as Marcel, excellent and not to be bettered. Mile. SIMON-
NET also first-rate in the part of Marguerite, not of Faust but of France,
La Seine Marguerite, who appears like a brilliant musical firework
in the second Act, and then goes out with a bang and is heard no
more. But for the time she is Queen of song. Altogether a fine
performance of the Huguenots, difficult to beat.
Saturday.—Grand night. House choke full, in spite of continued
cab strike. "Royalties," amounting to a considerable sum, thoroughly
appreciating Madame MELBA making her first appearance this season
as a French-speaking Marguerite to Signor DE LUCIA'S Italian
Faust. Her jewel song a gem, but not a brilliant. When ended,
floral compliments handed in. JUPITER PLANIJOH admirable as

WHAT can we do? Since a novelist
teaches us
That mediocrity's simply a crime,
How can we pass, as she warmly beseeches us,
From the ridiculous to the sublime P
If she will but condescend of her charity
Hints on the way it is managed to give,
Then will we all, with the utmost hilarity,
Live as her heroes and heroines live.
Then shall we lounge in luxurious leisure in
Rooms that are rich in each costly device,
Then shall enjoy an unlimited pleasure in
Smoking Havannahs of fabulous price.
If we play cricket, with marvellous steadiness
Centuries we shall compile as we please,
LASKEH at chess we snail conquer with
readiness,
Pulverise ROBERTS at billiards with ease.
While if we take to poetic activity,
Critics will reckon our cantos divine,
Or if we feel an artistic proclivity,
All of our pictures will be on the line.
Yes, could we reach to the proud elevation of
One of her heroes, there would not arise
Need for such lengthy and fierce castigation of
Base " Mediocrity's carrion-flies."
Cease, we beseech you, great censor, to jump
any
More on a failing we 're eager to shun,
Fain would we imitate STRATHMORE and com-

In their perfection—but how is it done?

somehow to get
a trip up to Richmond last
week, and if it hadn't bin for
the heavy rain and the bitter
cold wind as we had for a
good part of the time, we
ahond all have enjoyd it

waiters.

Everybody as knos Richmond
knos as well as I do that the
one great nuisance of that

nearly all run away, and so

has set to work for a year or

of the river up there in which

cillibrated "Stars and Gar-

they seemed to in joy their-
selves much as usual, and

the same frendly nod of

from what I heard from sum
of the natives, as how as there
is sum amount of gelosy at Q
on acount of their mud being
alpwed to remain as before,
without not no slooces for to
regerlate it, so I dare say as
they will be trying their hands
at a similer job next year, and
then we may all have to go
down to Q insted of up to
Richmond, and I shant object
for one.
As I was a coming out of

except get on with Budget Bill, which was pre-
ordained business of sitting. First, there was a
private Bill, which, in accordance with quaint
procedure of House, rides roughshod over every-
thing. When Japanese student of Parliament-
ary practice recently visited Westminter, he was
much struck with this evidence of Western
civilisation.
"You have," h» said to Mr. MILMAN. who, he
believes, wrote The History of Greek Chris-
tianity and The Annals of St. Paul's, " constant
difficulty about important measures. Ministers
have to apologise all round because they can't
make way for particular Bills, however far-
reaching may be their national or imperial in-
terests. It's all for lack of time. A public
Bill can come on only in certain order, and in
particular circumstances. But if there arrives
what you call a private Bill, to put up a parish
pump, or divert a village sewer, it must needs
be dealt with on any day the promoters fix, and
takes precedence over everything, even your
Budget BUI, or your several Disestablishment
Bills. I like to talk of this freely to you, for
it must be my only word on subject. If when
I go back I were to report existence of such state
of things in what you call the Mother of Parlia-
ments, my narrative would be punctuated by
fall of my head, struck off by a two-sworded
man, and that would be what you coll 'a full
atop.'"
Budget Bill not reached till House been in
session nearly five hours. Sat till half-past
twelve, but did nothing. Only gleam of light

MARKING TIME.
Sir William. "Doesn't look well on
the fact of it; but we mustn't quite
show all our hand yet!"
Tuesday.—SETON-KARR never so much sur-
prised in his life. Some people have prepared
scheme for carrying, not coals but, water to
Newcastle. Seems in drought of last year,
population of this thriving town threatened with
water famine. For weeks had nothing to drink
but champagne, chablis, and stout. Plenty of
water in the River Rede. Proposed to take it.
All very well, only scheme will interfere with
convenience of the salmon, who riot in the Rede.
SETON-IYARR, late of the Northern Circuit, is
trustee of one of the riparian owners. Petitioned
against Bill when before Lords. Opposition un-
availing. Much expected from Lords, but
proved, as riparian owner bitterly said, "a
broken Rede."
Now SETOS-KARR, producing brief, addresses
Commons at stupendous length, hoping to induce
them to save the salmon. Budget Bill waiting;
important Amendment and Division pending;
but SETON-KARR, like the River Rede, flows on.
He chatters over stony ways,
In little sharps and trebles;
He bubbles into eddying bays,
And babbles on the pebbles.
TIM HEALY made first attempt to dam him.
Suddenly dropped rock in level flow of his
argument in form of objection that, being
pecuniarily interested in question, he was not

competent to advocate the cause
in House of Commons. SETON-
K\ UK, just about to land a fresh
salmon in the way of concluding
argument, sat down amazed at
TIM'S temerity. SPEAKER never
taken aback, even by TIM
HEAXY, drew nice distinction.
In circumstances, SETON-KARR
was, he said, quite in order in
pleading cause of his clients;
but if Motion pressed to Divi-
sion, he would not be able to
vote.
Stream flowed on again; at
last ran dry; whereupon Jtus-
ticus Expectans appeared in
person of SQUIRF, OF MALWOOD,
who forthwith belaboured the
astonished fisherman with vigour
that took away what was left of
his breath. When recovered, he
proposed to expend it in further
speech. Called to order; Ques-
tion put from Chair; SPEAKER
declared Amendment negatived;
SETON-KABR wildly clamoured
for Division; Members near tried
to stop him.
"I think the Ayes have it,"
said SPEAKER for third time,
fixing the haplessfisherman with
glittering eye. SETON - KARR
feebly napped his arms as a
salmon landed on the bank of
the rustling Rede shakes its fins
in final protest against the whole
proceeding. I$nt no sound issued
from his parched lips, and New-
castle will have its water supply.
Dull hours of debate in Com-
mittee on Budget varied by
bright flash cast over scene by
PRINCE ARTHUR. Been absent
during dinner-time, shut up in
privacy of room. Comforted by
a cursorv chop, sustained by a
flagon of the bubbling Salutaris,
surrounded by musty treatises on Probate Duty, the Law of Succession,
the range of Mortmain, the young but austere statesman passed a soli-
tary hour. Came into House whilst COURTNEY was speaking; followed
him with genial compliment upon exceptional power of his speech.
The incentive of being at loggerheads with the party he formerly acted
with usually sustained him. Now, enjoying the luxury of being at
loggerheads with both parties, he surpassed himself. So did PRIXCE
ARTHUR, his brilliant speech, just crossing the limits of half an hour,
infusing life into the saddening scene, causing the dead bones of the
Budget debate to rattle into hilarious life. If preparation severe,
the result more than repaid the stern self-sacrifice.
Business done.—Not much. Some hours in Committee on Budget.
Thursday.—To say that butter wouldn't melt in mouth of SQUIRE
OF MALWOOD when, just now, he rose to move Resolution appro-
priating remaining time of Session for public business, would be
quite inadequate representation of fact. Remark, moreover, irrele-
vant. Why should butter melt in any man's mouth, or why should
it forbear? Apart from that not delectable illustration, there was
dangerous benignity in SQULRF.'S mood as he stood at the table. He
had no complaint to make of the past, nor imputation to cast
upon anyone a probable conduct in the future. Some people might
be disposed to say hard things about a blameless Opposition. Not
he. All he wanted was possession of the fragments of time hitherto
left at disposition of private Members.
So apprehensive was the SQUIRE of importing any trace of trucu-
lence into his manner, that he dropped his voice to whisper that
barely reached across the table. Members behind, more especially
those below the Gangway, could not hear. Angry shouts of " Speak
up!" ruffled the quiet scene. The SQUIRE'S face, as he turned to
face this tumult, was a study of meekness that might be done justice
to only by an artist in stained glass, whose masterpiece is set in quiet
nook of country church. For his part the SQUIRE could not under-
stand any mood less placid than that of a lily-strewn pond, nor any
impulse to raise the voice above that attuned to benediction.
"That's all very well," said Baron FERDY. "A voice soft and
low is a beautiful thing in woman. In Leader of House of Commons
it's a little embarrassing, especially for a modest man like me, who

(A Suggestion in view of another Cab Strike.)
instinctively takes his place on
a back bench. Half the time
when the SQUIRE is speaking at
the table we in this part of
House catch a word only here
and there, and we can't afford
to lose a syllable of his uttered
speech."
A good deal in this. Since
Session opened SQUIRE, as he
describes himself, standing
between rival friends and united
foes, overwhelmed by the kind-
ness of one and devoured by the
other, has fallen into the habit
t (if pitching his voice in a key
that does not carry it further
than across the table, leaving
other parts of House distraught.
That however by the way.
To-night the SQUIRE disarmed
Opposition at the outset.
Whole thing managed so well
that debate closed before dinner,
and the SQUIRE got all he asked.
Business done.—Remaining
period of Session appropriated
for public business.
Friday.—"Don't hear much
now of ELLIS ASHMEAD-
15 AH T LETT (Knight)" said
WILFRID LA.WSON, looking
across at Front Opposition
Bench. "But it's always a
comfort to me to find him fit-
ting there with arms folded,
legs crossed, and on his face
a look of grave suspicion of
the Government."
"Why does he always sit
with his legs crossed Y" asked
the Member for SABK, ever
eager for information.
"'Tis a knightly attitude."
said Sir WILFRID. "You'll
see it on the tombs in ancient
churches. It shows that he's
either been to the Crusades, or is going."
"I hope he hasn't been," said the Member for SABK, with a far-
away look in his eyes.

Are as vulgar as coin of the mint;
And you merely distinguish yourself from the crowd
By the fact that you put 'em in print.
You 're a 'prentice, my boy, in the primitive stage.
And you itch, like a boy, to confess:
When you know a bit more of the arts of the age
You will probably talk a bit less.
Fur your dull little vices we don't care a fig,
It is this that we deeply deplore;
You were cast for a common or usual pig.
But you play the invincible bore.

No. VI.—FBOM THE HON. VICTOR MAYDEW TO HIS BROTHER,
CAPTAIN- THE HON. HAROLD MAYDEW, 24TH LANCERS, NAVAL
AND MILITARY CLUB, LONDON.
MY DEAK HAROLD, Hotel JUeurtrt, Paris, Jan. 6, 18!)—.
I needn't tell you how sorry I am to hear of all your troubles.
At the same time, I 'm sincerely glad you wrote to me. Of course I
•will help you. 1 have written to JAQUES AND NEWBOLD to arrange
everything for you up to £1500. If you will pay them a visit at
their office in Frederick's Place, Old Jewry, E.G., and give them all
the necessary information as to names, amounts, &c., you'll find
they '11 settle the whole business for you ever so much more quickly
and cheaply than you could doit personally. Yourdebts "of honour"
you will, I presume, like to settle yourself. I don't speak of those,
but of tie cigar gentlemen, the "bookies," and the Hebrew with
the plural name of ABRAHAMS. Don't you try to deal with him.
Leave that job to Mr. JAQCKS, who knows a trick or two of fence, and
can pink even so clever a swordsman with the most perfect neatness,
propriety, and despatch. And, after all, ABRAHAMS is a "difficulty,"
for all his hair-oily affectation of bonhomie, and pretence at reckless,
spendthrift, dashing
habits. When I see
him driving about in
his smart Victoria,
drawn by two spank-
ing bays.—well, no
matter,—I am con-
tent to be afoot, and
need I say, that, had
I the honour or hia
personal acquaintance,
I should salute him
far more respectfully
than do my Lord This
and Sir Something
That, who are so
deeply indebted to
him.
You '11 find old
JAQTTES a first-class
man. He's just as
clever as a man can

you up, and jot down

these smooth and completed follies. Besides, think of it, we haven't
got by any means too many promising soldiers to be the Marlboroughs
and the Wellingtons of the future. You are cut out by Nature to be
a great soldier, a leader of men, to give a new and brilliant distinction
to our name. Don't check yourself almost at the very start.
There, that's enough of preaching. Off goes the surplice, never,
I hope, to be donned again before the same fraternal congregation of
one. I shall be back in London in a week's time, and we will then
have a great talk, and settle all that is outstanding in our own
affairs and in those of the universe.
I have had a delightful time here. The weather has been bright,
and positively warm, and I have gone my usual round of theatres and
restaurants. PAUL UK CHAVMONT is here^ and has done the honours
of his beautiful city like the prince he is. There is something in
Paris, in its broad and airy streets, in the brightness of its shop-
windows, and, above all, in the cheerful and unaffected gaiety and
good-humour of the people, rich and poor, which always acts on me
like the sound of running water on a hot day—gives me a sense of
refreshment and repose. These people don't hate us, whatever the
blusterers on both sides may say or do. Who can be angry with
them if they now and then resent our burly, over-fed, beef-and-beer
assumption of an incontestable superiority? Don't we pay them
back by our allusions'to tiger-monkeys, and an immoral society and
literature? For my-
self, I can assure you
that I never meet any-
where else with such
simple courtesy and
food-will from all as
do here. To be an
Englishman seems to
be a passport to their
hospitality and friend-
ship.
By the way, at the
Palais Royal last night
I saw Mr. and Mrs.
VEN ABLES,both purple
with laughter at one
of the riskiest situa-
tions ever put upon
the French stage.
What pinks of solemn
propriety are the
VENABLBS pair in
London, how perfectly
British, how out-
wardly respectable,
how decorously dull
are all their habits
and their belongings.
Only a fortnight ago
VENABLES was made
president of some
league or other for
elevating the moral
standard of the lower
classes. How furiously
are bis chief delight—
books, and the society
of his friends. If you want to know what laughter means, wait till he inveighed on that occasion against "the licencejwhich, like a

or a bright flash of the unexpected. Then, when he has got his
hearers with him. away he goes, dragging them after him in the
wildest gallops of a humorous fancy, until, with a masterstroke of
memory (or invention), he plunges you, souse, head-over-ears into
helpless laughter. When you've seen him, tu m'en diras des nouvelles.
My dear old HAROLD, when I started this letter, I meant to preach
to you one of the very finest and most paternal sermons ever delivered,
but the heads of the discourse seem to have escaped me. Still I can't
let you off altogether. Hang it, man, you're no longer a mere boy. If
the family Bible tells the truth, you 've begun your twenty-ninth year,
and if various public documents are to be believed you nave already
taken and given some hard knocks on behalf of your country in various
African and Asiatic battlefields. Is a man like you, two fine, full-
blooded, hearty, straight-forward unaffected yards of humanity, with
a good position and a brilHant record to his name, is such a man to be
for ever the boon companion of gamblers and fools, a mere mass of
squeezable material ready for the money-lender's grasping fingers?
My dear boy, if you were to be asked that question about anyone else
you 'd laugh in derision of the mere idea. You can laugh now, if you
like, when I ask you the question about yourself—but when you have
done laughing just pull yourself together and reflect. Heaven knows
we 're none of us perfect, not even the most middle-aged of us, but
after all there are some follies that simply jump to the eyes and
declare themselves as perfect follies, made ad unguem, as our old Head
cankerworm, has eaten it's way into the heart of the French nation,
has blasted their drama, destroyed their literature, and shaken the
foundations of their social edifice." The metaphors were mixed,
but they were received with tremendous applause by his fellow-
leaguers. And now behold VENABLES paying his money like any
Frenchman to see a Palais Royal farce, and laughing till I thought
his white tie would be shaken off his collar. Well, well!
Farewell, my dear boy! Keep your pecker up!
Ever your affectionate brother, VICTOB.
MRS. B. ON THE OXFORD TROUBLE.—Mrs. R. on the Ch. Ch. dis-
turbances i* inclined to side with the College Dons in their recent
treatment of the undergraduates accused of being riotous. "Of
course," says our old friend, "I don't quite understand these matters,
but when I hear of a set of young men, members of some Bullying
Club, which name is enough to condemn them, getting together and
painting, perhaps tarring and feathering toot a helpless fellow-student
of the name of TOM QUAD, then I must say it seems to me time for the
authorities to interfere. On the other hand, I must say that I think
the custom, still permitted, of hunting undergraduates with trained
bull-dogs seems to m,e to be a relic of Darbarous times that ought to
be discontinued." •

WHERE 's TEB
A TALE FOE THE CABMEN.
(A Story to be Head at a Shelter Gathering.)
THEBE was once a driver who had a cab and horse. And he used
to take them out, and was very civil, and obtained many a fare.
And he was pleased with the result. In those days omnibuses were
costly, and the Metropolitan and District Railways were things of
the future.
And, as the years passed, the cabman came to the conclusion
that he would make more money by striking. So he left his cab
in the yard, and put his horse in the stable. Then he looked at
the Public.
"The Public will find it an awful nuisance," he observed; "and
goon will be brought to their senses."
But the Public seemed disinclined to become rational. On the con-
Irarv, they expressed satisfaction that there should be so much less
traffic in the streets, and rejoiced exceedingly.
Then the cabman, noticing that the Metropolitan and District
Railways had become cheaper, raised his fares.
"That will bring the Public to their senses," he exclaimed.
"When they find that they cannot have my cab without paying
more money there will be quite a competition to enter its doors."
But again the cabman was out in his reckoning. The Public
refused to patronise cabs because these vehicles were dearer and
underground railways cheaper.
"Ah, I know what I will do now," observed the cabman, when the
omnibuses and tram-cars also lowered their fares; "I will raise my
rate per mile even higher."
But once again the Public failed to see the necessity of the
cabman's action. Then the driver of the horse in the cab became
very melancholy, and asked an old friend for advice.
"Why, learn that demand commands supply, and that the more
you try to charge the less you will surely get. Do not forget that
two and two make four, and that anyone who says they are either
three or five is a very faulty counsellor."
And the cabman (very properly) thanked Mr. Punch for his
excellent advice, and attempted to follow it.

QUEER QUERIES.
THE SILVER STEEAK.—What is this ridiculous plan of a bridge
across the Straits of Dover? Could anything be more absurd—unless
it were the other schemes of a tunnel, a steam ferry, or a tubular
railway? I am glad to see that the Prince of MONACO knocks the
bridge idea into a cocked hat in this month's Fortnightly. He shows
lhat an ironclad colliding with the bridge would break the bank, so
to speak; and of course anybody on the bridge at the time would
dime a croupier,—a cropper, I mean. No; the only really practical
scheme is one I have patented. What is the objection to the tunnel?
That it goes underground. What to a ferry? That it goes on the
water. Well, then, the only element left is the air, and my plan is
to use lhat. All you have to do is to moor a sufficient number of
captive balloons to buoys, connect the balloons with pulleys, and then
you jubt step from one to another till you get across. What could be
timpler'? Now, will some millionaire kindly supply me with capital
to carry out this design ?—BALLOONATIC.
ACCOBHTIKG FOB IT.—A note in the P. 3i. G. last Friday in-
formed us that "The Parisians pay only one shilling and eleven
pence per head for their water, compared with four shillings and
fourpence per head which we pay in London." Certainly, the water
here is high-priced, but in Paris it is and must always be I'run.

MY DF.\K PR-MR-SE,—A day or two ago when I saw you I promised
to write you in any event after June 6. I 'm delighted to think
that I can now congratulate you with
all my heart on winning the Derby,
on what will, of course, be known
henceforth as Primrose Day. I read

THE OPERA-GOER'S DIARY.
Tuesday.—" In consequence of many requests," said Sir DHUEIO-
LANCS OFERATICUS in his programme, "that Madame MELBA should
appear in DONIZETTI'S Lucia"—why so she does, and here she is
delighting everyone, and encored in every
scene. Lucia comes out as fresh as ever it
did. Only get the right people in the right
parts, and there's life in all the old Operas
that have had a brilliant career. A comet
appears, startles us with its brilliancy, then,
having made its mark, it retires into space
for a hundred years or so, and then reappears
brighter than ever. Signor IOINIO COBSI
was an excellent Arturo—of course he would
be—and Signor W. BKDUSCHI, as Edgardo,
pleased a full and enthusiastic house. A
light voice has BEDUSCHI, to be known hence-
forth as FEATHER-BED-USCHI. The season
may be sorry, temperature treacherous, cab-
strike contemptible, everybody anywhere and
money nowhere, yet does the Opera attract,
and anything like a bad house seems to be
quite an exception to the rule. Merry
MANCINELLI conducted, and chorus was
conscientious and capital. So "I love my
love with an 'L' because she's Lucia" and
I congratulate Sir D. 0. with an M because of MELBA.
Wednesday—the Derby Night.—House must have lost on the
race, as it looked rather poor. Audience unenthusiastic. Everybody
present talking of Ladas. MELBA excellent, but couldn't struggle
against general depression of Derby Night. PLAsgoN perfect as
Mephistopheles ; but general impression seemed to be_that no one in
[he nouse, on the stage or off it, had backed the winner. Much
applause, but no enthusiasm, and no encores "taken or offered";
probably losers on race among audience considerately felt for
probable losers on stage, and thought they had no notes to spare.
Hence no encores. BKVIGNANI bothered, but bold. Outside no cabs.
Everyone expecting that, as Sir DRTTRIOLANUS had addressed a cab-
drivers' meeting, there would be a plentiful supply of four-wheelers
and Hansoms. But Hansoms doing the un-hansome thing, and not
:here to take ladies. Sir PBUBIOLAKTJS, it was said, had at one time
thought of putting Omnibus Box at disposition of habitues, but
proposal negatived by Operatic Committee.
Friday.—If striking cabmen not to be found outside Opera, very
striking Carmen to t>e seen and heard within. Madame (.' u.vf.
admirable as ever as the heroine. Monsieur ALDERS good as Esea-
millo, the Toreadored One, and Signor COSSIBA passable as Don
si'; IU.VIONANI brilliant, carefully conducting orderly orchestra.
Saturday.—Rigoletto with Madame MELBA "by special desire," to
luote Sir DKUUIOLANTPS'S "no-charge" programme. And the com-
rinatiim was irresistible. House crowded in every part, no further
•oom in the stalls, boxes with full complement of spectators. Madame
UEJ.KA in admirable voice. Calls after every fall of the cnrtain,
accompanied with basket of choice flowers. This last, of course, in-
ended for heroine of the evening. Received with becoming gratitude.
MadameMtLBAsupported with excellenteffeetbvMlle.BAUEBMEtsTER

Duke by Signor DE LUCIA, and the double-lifed dwarf by Signor

QUEER QUERIES.
FOWL-LAW.—I see that a Magistrate told a complainant the other
day that there was " no remedy" for the nuisance of a crowing cock
next door, and that the only course was to "appeal to the sense of
propriety" of the owner. Is this good law? Would it not be better
to appeal to his sense of property by shooting the disturber out of
hand, or out of an air-gun? My own copy of BLACKSIONE is forty
years old and has most of the pages missing, but I am sure I once
read that for a cock to crow within five hundred yards of an in-
habited house was a tort ab initio, and that one had a right to stop
the crow in transitu. It's an interesting question. Perhaps the
Lord Chanticleer—I mean the LORD CHANCELLOR—might reply.
BARKISTKR (UNCALLED).

DUMB SPECTATOES.
SIR,—It is absurd to say that only dogs recognise likenesses. I
have a tame lizard which is quite as extraordinary in that respect as
any dog mentioned by your correspondents. Last year my wife's
portrait was painted by a Royal
Academician whose name I shall
not divulge. We all thought it
an extremely unsatisfactory like-
ness, and were very much annoyed
with the artist for refusing to paint
his sitter in her emerald silk gown,
a present to my wife from her aunt,
Lady JOSKINS. As a test we de-
cided to let the lizard see the pic-
ture. He knows my wife very well,
aa she gives him his daily feed of
bread and milk in the dining-room. We brought
the intelligent little fellow up to the picture in
his basket. You may judge of our astonishment
when I tell you that he gave absolutely no sign
of recognition whatever, thus proving that, how-
ever good the picture may have been as a work
of art, it was entirely without value as a likeness. These so-called
dumb creatures can teach us many a lesson, both in art and in
general conduct, and those who would credit them merely with
instinct are very, very far from the truth.
I am, Sir, yours, &c., JOHN HENHY NCMSKTJLL.
SIR,—I have a cat which I make bold to say is superior to any dog
I have ever heard of in its power not only of recognising likenesses,
but also of adapting its behaviour to the circum-
stances that naturally arise from such a recognition.
In order to make my meaning plain, I will relate
a remarkable incident that happened only yesterday
in our drawing-room. Ebenezer (that is the name of
the cat in question) very often jumps on to my shoul-
ders, and sits there for quite a long time. Yester-
day, when I went into the drawing-room, I found him
reclining in an arm-chair close to the mantelpiece.
On removing Ebenezer, I found on the seat of the
arm-chair a particularly good
photograph of myself, taken last
year in the uniform or the High-
gate Ponds Royal Yacht Club.
The photograph generally stands
on the mantelpiece, and had evi-
dently fallen, face downwards,
where I found it. Ebenezer, see-
ing it in that position, must have
realized that it was a speaking
likeness of his master. He must
then have decided to place himself
on his master's shoulders, in his
usual attitude of repose. It was thus that I found him sitting, as
it were, on the back and shoulders of my photograph. Think, Sir,
of the train of thought that must have passed through that animal's
mind. Who will dare, after this, to deny to cats the possession of
a reasoning faculty at least equal to that of human beings?
Yours, &c., THOMAS TTLEE MEWSON.
SIR,—I think the following true story of the reason-
ing power of animals will interest your readers. Last
month I painted a battle picture entitled " A Brush
with the Arabs." Happening to leave it on the easel
one day when I went out for my morning walk, 1 was
surprised to find on my return that my two favourite
fox-hound puppies had secured an entrance to the
studio, and had literally torn the picture to pieces.
They must have recognised the word "Brush" in the
title, and, being naturally reminded of their here-
ditary enemy, the fox, must have thought it their
duty to destroy the picture. I was so greatly im-
pressed by their intelligence, that, although much
vexed at the loss of the picture, I refrained from
chastising them. Yours very truly,
WILLIAM JOHROCXS DAUBLET.



MRS. R. read a heading in a daily paper last week; it was "The
Sutherland Will Suit." Without further perusal she exclaimed,
"Dear me! a tailor's advertisement, of course! I wonder if 'The

tailor know that it ' trill suit'.' There's no end to their impudence!"
And our worthy friend passed over the article and went to anothei

THE COLONIAL STATESMAN'S
VADE MECTJM.
(Written up to Date.)
Question. What is the proper objects of a
Colonial statesman's ambition?
Answer. To secure for his own Colony the
best possible position, and to strengthen as
much as possible the bond uniting it to the
mother country.
Q. Is this second object finding at this
moment further development?
A. Certainly by the calling of an Inter-
colonial Conference at Ottawa.
Q. Who have arranged to be present at this
important gathering?
A. Most of the Premiers and other leading
politicians of the American, Australasian and
South African Colonies.
Q. Then, from a Colonial point of view, the
meeting will be of a thoroughly representative
character?
A. Undoubtedly, as no important Colony
will be without a statesman representing its
particular interests.
Q. What are the subjects that will be dis-
cussed at this cvidentlv important Congress?
A. One of them will be the institution of an
intercolonial commercial union.
Q. Is not this a matter that should interest
subjects of HEK MAJESTY living in the mother
country?
A. Certainly, since it will affect the com-
merce of the United Kingdom.
Q. Is not intercolonial free trade also to
form a matter of discussion?
A. Yes, and here again England should, in
her own interests, have her say.
Q. And is it not considered possible that
Imperial Defence will be considered?
A. Not only possible, but probable. There
is no doubt that this subject alone would
justify the presence of an English Minister
of Cabinet rank at the'.deliberations of the
Congress.
Q. Are there any other subjects that may
be considered worthy of Imperial (in distinc-
tion from Colonial) consideration?
A. Why, certainly. African transconti-
nental railways and telegraph schemes will
no doubt appear on the agenda.
Q. Anything else?
A. Most likely the rights of the Colonies
to enter into diplomatic relations with Foreign
Powers without reference to Downing Street
may form a subject of the most serious con-
sideration.
Q. Then, of course the mother country will
be represented by a number of experts well
qualified to tender advice and generally guard
the Imperial interests?
A. Certainly not. The Earl of JERSEY will
be present, but chiefly inaceremonialcapacity.
Q. Can yon give the possible reason for this
strange inaction on the part of the Foreign
Office and the Colonial Office?
A. It probably arises from the blundering
of some minor official, or the laziness of a
personage of superior importance.
Q. Apd what may be the result of this
blundering or laziness?
A. That England's heritage beyond the seas
may slip from her grasp for ever.

The stalls between:

Then my poor bunch I offered you
With pleading look.
But ah, with a determined air
You shook your head,
And bid me keep them! "Won't you w.;

And, as you granted me this grace—

But yet there fell upon your face

I 'M BKGINNIN' TO THINK AS THB PUBLICS DOESN'T KNOW WHAT
LETTER TO A DEBUTANTE.—II.
MY DEAK GLADYS,—It is satisfactory to hear that my advice has
been, so far, of service to you.
I gather that you enjoyed your first party, though the only items
of success you mention are that a celebrated Hungarian pianist shook
hands with you, mistaking you for somebody else, and that an
Austrian attache was introduced to you, at his own request, three
times in the course of one evening—each time showing not the
smallest recollection of having ever seen you before.
I am interested in your admirer. Your description of him is
delightful; yet, lucid as it is, it fails to convey to me a delinite i but outline and general effect
picture of the man. You say— | YOU remember the advice
He is rather intellectual and amusing, but not at all dull. He
photographs, and has written a book on South Africa, but I am afraid
Fie is not very religious. Personally, he is rather dark, but not tall.
Lady TAYMKB says he is a good match. Shall I encourage him? He
docs conjurini,' tricks." - - •
Frankly, GLADYS, it appears to me that he is too accomplished,
[injuring tricks, alluring as they may be, socially, to the young and
unsophisticated, when carried into domestic life would be apt to pall,
or, in time, even to cause dissension. Your liking him "pretty
well," and his beius: " personally" dark but not tall, are not suffi-
cient grounds for giving him marked encouragement. Still, do .not
be absolutely chilling in your manner.
Keep him in doubt as to the degree of
yonr regard for him, and if you can
possibly prevent it, do not let him send
you his book on South Africa yet—as
that would end your friendship too
abruptly.
That tragic little episode about "the
really delightful man" with whom you
got on so splendidly at dinner made me
smile—it recalled my own youth. My
dear child, ahcays mistrust a man who
tells you he is sure he has met you in a
previous existence. He is invariably a
fraud, and it was inevitable that just
as you were beginning to think you nad
found your ideal he should introduce
his wife—a fat old lady whom you had
fancied to be "a sort of aunt." This
blow will be a lesson toyouforthefuture.
A hint for ball-rooms. Supposing that
you had promised someone a valse, and
your partner, either being at supper or
for some other reason, failed to claim it
— which might happen to the most
popular girl—let me entreat you not to
stand near the door with the blush of
shame on your countenance and the
agony of despair in your heart, betray-
ing, by your anxious eyes and flut-
tering fan. all the humiliating fear that
people will think no one has asked you.
Sit calmly down, and await events. If
another person should present himself,
keep him by your tide, but do not valse
with an incompetent dancer merely to
show you are not without a friend. He
might tear your frock, and then he
would be your enemy for life. In these
days of anarchy and no programmes, an
unruffled demeanour is the best resource.
At race-courses, where Sir LYON is
sure to take you, affect neither a celestial
ignorance nor an absolute knowledge of
horses. Do not ask "Which do you
think will get there first?" nor " Won't
the poor things be dreadfully tired?"
But, on the other hand, do not say,
knowingly, that Barley-Sugar looks a
bit oft' colour to-day, nor that you have
taken 5 to 2 about Hedda Oabler for a
place.
Another word of warning. If you
observe a gentleman rather frequently
with one lady, don't ask " whether they
are engaged. The chances are that he
may be a barrister, and the the wife of
a solicitor. And the person to whom
you are talking may DC the solicitor.
(This is, of course, entirely a fanciful
and impossible instance—merely to show
you it is better to refrain from questions.)
And now, let me impress on you once more, never to worry about
trifles, and still less about serious matters. It is hardly possible to
exaggerate the unimportance of nearly everything that happens.
At this time of year, when so much is crowded into so short a space
of time, you will constantly hear, " I was so sorry you could not
come to my At Home, dear." "Why, I did come darling! and
enjoyed myself so much." "Oh yes, so you did; then it must have
been somebody else who didn't," &o.
And young people like yourself are apt to overrate the value of
details in dress. If you cannot get that bit of mauve nbbon to
match your shoes, you think you will be a failure! Nothing matters
You remember the advice the Red Queen gave to Alice in
Wonderland? "Curtsey when you're thinking what to say—it
saves time." For curtsey, substitue laugh. Cultivate a continuous
slight, ready, unmeaning society laugh, about nothing in particular.
It is invaluable, it tills gaps, and tides over difficult moments.
Write soon again, telling me of the progress of your friendship
with the South African conjuror, and all other news.
Ever aitc'ctionattly yours, MAHJOEIK.

THE GRAND PRIX.
(By a Non-sporting Prophet.)
No League, that now proclaims
The sin of bets, depresses
These animated dames,
In such delightful dresses.
Some horses? There may be—
They often run at races;
But rather let us see
These very pretty faces.
Some makers, too, of books—
A man of taste confesses
That he prefers the looks
Of those who wear the dresses.
Some folks who yell with joy,
Or groan with grim grimaces—
Enthusiasts annoy,
They have not pretty faces.
Avoid them, show your taste,
See rather who possesses
Bright eyes, sweet mouth, slim
waist,
And daintiest of dresses.
Such'costumes, festive, new,
On'forms of modern Graces!
Pink, yellow, white, and blue,
Show up the pretty faces.
Gav, graceful hats adorn
The coils of silken tresses;
Vile "buns" are never worn
By those who sport these
dresses.
A hush—the race is run,
A shout—and each one presses
To see the horse that won
Led past the dainty dresses.
The fair ones drive away;
To Paris one retraces
One's steps, and dreams of gay
Petage and prettv faces.

THE REBELLION IN COBEA.—Last
we«k it was announced in the Times
that an expedition against _the rebels
was embarking from China under
command of " General YES." What
an idea of harmonious unity in mili-
tary action does this name suggest!
"General YES!" If only the rebels
were in force under " Field-Marshal
No" the contest might be settled in
English Parliamentary fashion with-
out bloodshed, the members of both
parties going into the lobbies. But,
against a "General YES," or even a
prettv general" Yes,"thedissentients
wouldn't have a chance.
SUGGESTED IMPBOVEMENT.—Surely
a better title than Cricket Songs for
Mr. NOBMAN GALE'S recently pub-
lished book would have been Chtrps.
The name of "NormanGale" is sug-
gestive of " French airs."

House of Commons, Monday, June 4.—
Clause I. of Budget at length added to Bill. As
the SQUIRE says, "You cast your Clause on the
Committee and find it again after many days."
The Scotch Members in Grand Committee on
Local Government Bill are, SABK tells me, lost
in admiration of themselves at the business-like
fashion in which they approach their tank. At
one sitting get through, more than would be done
in a week in Committee of whole House. This
comes of avoiding the making of long speeches.
They converse instead of orate. Different in
Committee on Budget Bill. To-night BYBNE
moving amendment delivered speech of propor-
tions that need not have been exceeded on intro-
ducing the Budget scheme. Full of riddles as
to what would happen to brothers and sisters of
the grandfather or grandmother of the deceased,
in the event of his (or her) having married a
second cousin's aunt, always assuming that the
principal value of the whole succession does not
amount to £10,000 (see 16 & 17 Vic. o. 51, i. 18).
HAT/DANK and FLETCHER MOULTON, sitting
together behind SQUIBE OF MALWOOD ready to
"give him a knee," or show themselves handy
with the sponge, after one of his rounds witn
JOKIM, looked wondrous wise. Suppose they

understood it all. But, as Dr. MACGREGOB eays,
quoting his favourite author SYDNEY SMITH,
to the general it is caviare on toast." Then
GRANT LAWSOX, not liking forward manner in
which BTBNE behaved, came along with his case
of conundrums, laying them out in speech of
prodigious weight and illimitable length.
The Member for SABK, who does not mean to
offer himself for re-election, tells me he is having
prepared a little legacy which he will leave to
House of Commons free of Succession Duty. It
is a silken scarf, which he proposes to have
bound on the front of the canopy over the
SPEAKER'S chair. On it will be embroidered in
letters of gold these words, which he heard from
the lips of ANDBEW CABNEGIE, or some other
great American humourist—
If you can't strike ile in twenty minutes,
Cease boring.
Capital idea. If anything comes of it, SABK
will be remembered through future ages as bene-
factor of House of Commons. There is nothing
useful to say that cannot be fully uttered in
twenty minutes. Wouldn't be at all a bad
thing, next time we improve Parliamentary pro-
cedure, to have new Standing Order, founded
on principle of maximum length of speech. Our
motto should be Twenty minutes; apres $a le

it was poised aloft quite suffi-

Budget Bill through Com-
mittee.
Tuesday.—Grave difference
of opinion was manifested on
occasion of JOHN WILLIAM
MACLURE'S historic encounter
with the Bishop of LONDON in
Lobby. Some disposed to re-
gard as indiscreet the invita-
tion to partake at the bar of
a glass of sherry and bitters.
The Bishop, as it happened,
coming in from House of
Lords, was in canonical dress.
The vision of a lawn sleeve
stretched out across the bar to
lift to right reverend lips a
flass of sherry, even with
itters, might have b en
misconstrued. It would be
different now, when the bar
is removed to a discreet
corner- then it stood in full
view of crowded Lobby.
Others hold that JOHN
WILLIAM acted on the occa-
sion in accordance with im-
pulse of kindly heart, and
worthily vindicated hospi-
table instincts of House of
Commons. Here was visitor
from neighbouring House
straying into Lobby about
the nour when, to some cul-
tivated tastes, a compound of
sherry and bitters recom-

"Szo I Miss MARY, I>EY TELL ME DAT you SHALL TELL MY GARACHTER
BY MY HANDT!"
"WELL, TO BEGIN WITH, YOU 'RE A GERMAN"
"ACH, IT IS VONDERFUL I"
mends itself; no harm in asking; Bishop could at least say "No,"
and then the conversation might have been changed.
Balance of opinion, trembling at time, would doubtless been plumped
in JOHN WILLIAM'S favour had it been known how intimate are his
relations with the Church and, presumably, how authoritative his
action in relation thereto. To-day he moved adjournment of
House over Derby Day, and was seconded by SQUIRE OF BLANKNET.
SQUIBE naturally backed his opinion by reference to desirability of
keeping up the breed of horse'. JOHST WILLIAM, humbly yet
proudly, spoke " as a Churchwarden and a member of the House of
Laymen of the Province of York."
Even this rare combination of both branches of the Church did not
avail against stern business principles of SQUIRE OF MALWOOD.
House just consented to place its whole time at disposal of Govern-
ment. Could not give up a day to go to the Derby, even when
invited by official spokesman of Church and Laity. Forthwith
divided, and holiday renounced by rattling majority of 86 in House
of over 400.
Only the two Squires and the Churchwarden spoke. Often read
paragraphs founded on marriage or obituary notice in the Times
which set forth that their " united ages amounted to" so and so.
"I wonder now," said WILFRID LAWSON, gazing reflectively on
the three members who had monopolised the debate, "what their
united weights would scale."
Business done.— Slill harping on the Budget.
Thursday.—Been revival of talk lately on the old subject of
removing grille from before Ladies' Gallery. Advocates of woman's
rights, feeling that they lose appreciable advantage in obscuring the
personal charms of prominent members of Hie party, would tear the
railings down. Others insist that on the whole the regulation as it
exists is preferable. HERBERT GLADSTONE, with the rashness of
comparative youth and the vigour of a freshly-appointed Minister,
signalised his accession to Commissionership of Board of Works by
proposing to remove part of grille. Found he had placed his hand
on hornets' nest; judiciously withdrew; positively declines to have
anything further to say on subject.
Those in favour of retaining the grille find their position much
strengthened by incident that occurred just now in discussion on one
of the amendments to amendments proposed on amended clauses of
Budget Bill. In course of his argument PRINCE ARTHUR, blushing
—whether with satisfaction or remorse will never be known—inci-
dentally observed, "Now, I am a bachelor." Easy to imagine,
supposing the ladies had sat in their Gallery in full view, how em-
barrassing this remark, in
its irrelevancy amounting
almost to a challenge, would
have been. As it was, the
occupants of the Ladies' Gal-
lery remained in obscurity.
Only those immediately near
heard what French reporters
call moitrrment; a swift, soft
rustling of dresses and some-
thing that sounded like a sup-
pressed nigh.
Since he desired the post
everyone sorry to hear that
WALLACE has failed to secure
coronorahip fir East London.
Seems he was selected out of
multitude of applicants, one
in a group of nine. On fur-
ther consideration this re-
duced to three and WALLACE
left out. "One of the Muses,"
says SARK; "but not thought
good enough for the Graces.
This is way we treat our most
brilliant men. We do not
even make them coroners."
Business done.—Clause II.
added to Budget Bill.
Friday. — Level course of
dreary debate on death duties
occasionally relieved by little
rounds between JOKIM and
SQUIRE OF MALWOOD. On
Monday JOKIM complained, in
delightful phrase, that "the
right hon. gentleman, Ihe
CHANCELLOR OF THE EX-
CHEQUER, never opens his
mouth to make a speech on
this Bill without trailing his
coat." JOKIM, for his part,
only embarrassed by the
wealth of opportunity. Momentarily distraught as to whether he
should jump down the CHANCELLOR'S throat, or merely tread on
his coat. One feat or the other certainly accomplished. Scuffle for
some minutes; then interval for refreshments; tilled up by speech
from GRANT LAWSON or TOMMY BOWLES.
Pleasant contrast afforded by momentary appearance on scene of
ROBERTSON, who rises to reply to question addressed to the Civil
Lord of the Admiralty. Pretty to see how he dresses the part, and
fulfils the obligations of his Ministerial title.
Business done.— Clause III. Budget Bill passed.
THE CAPITALISTS.
(A Story o/ Yesterday for To-morrow and To-day.}
"WHAT, BROWN, my boy, is that you?" said SMITH, heartily.
"The same, and delighted to see you," was the reply.
"Have you heard the news, my dear fellow?" asked SMITH.
"You mean about the position of the Bank of England? Why,
certainly; all the city is talking about it."
"Ah, it is absolutely grand! Never was the Old Lady of
Threadneedle Street in such a strong position. Marvellous! my
dear friend; absolutely marvellous!"
"Quite so. Never were we—as a people—so rich!"
"Yes, prosperity seems to be coming back by leaps and bounds."
"You never said anything so true," observed SMITH.
"Right you are," cried BROWN.
And then the two friends shook hands once more with increased
cordiality, and passed on. They walked in different directions a few
steps, and both stopped. They turned round.
ll SMITH," said BROWN, " I have to ask you a trifling favonr."
"BROWN, it is granted before I know its purport."
"Well, the truth is, I am penniless—lend me half-a-erown."
SMITH paused for a moment.
"You surely do not wish to refuse me?" asked BROWN, in a tone
of pained surprise.
"I do not, SMITH," replied his friend, with fervour. "Indeed, I
do not!"
"Then produce the two-and-sixpence."
"I would, my dear fellow, if in the wide world I could raise it!"
And then the ancient comrades shook hands once again, and parted
in sorrow, but not in anger. They felt that after all they were only
in the fashion.

being just the same, minus the Scotch accent!
The BERKELEYS who you know are here too; the girl isn't a bad
sort, and I tell you what, JACK, you might do worse than marry her.

You've got to marry money, and she's got a pot of it; and she 's
rather a pal of mine and very nice, besides being very well turned

got to look sharp and make the running, or she '11 be snapped up. I

THE SITUATION IN HALT-KALF.
(By One who Known.)
MR. PUNCH, DEAR SIR,—My personal reminiscences of the late
BtrLBCL VON HALF-KALF may interest you as throwing some light on
the present European deadlock, and tending to preserve in some
measure the status in quid pro quo. My qualification to speak lies
in the fact that I belong to a famous hrm of pyjama-brokers, and
that my father before me, and my grandfather,'need I say, before
him, have for generations served the harem of the deceased potentate.
My first interview with him was by my own appointment. I found
the monarch in the garden of his Shaftesbury Palace of Varieties
seated in an oriental bath-chair, surmounted by a baldachin of
matchless rubies. I remember noticing this at the time. We dis-
pensed with an interpreter, his Majesty declaring that my old Dutch
was familiar to him from the frequent visits of up-to-date British
artistes bound for Half-Kalf. On this occasion, as always, he sat
with his back to me, occasionally caressing my person with the flat
of his foot. You are probably unaware that the Bulbul's-eye is
certain death, and the touch of his hand a breach of etiquette.
I was not slow in discovering that the accepted estimate of the
Lord of Half-Kalf was based upon gross ignorance. Thus, although
his seraglio was constructed upon lines of almost Semitic extrava-
gance, and could, at a pinch, hold 1500 odd, the Bulbul was by
principle an austere monogamist; I might almost say, a celibate.
Again, his extraordinary gifts of insomnia may be realised when I
say that I have frequently left the presence-chamber at 2.30 A.M. to
be hastily summoned at 2.45 to witness a review of mounted Kiff-
liall's parading before the sleepless monarch.

a superb clarion sounded the popular refrain of " My lot takes the
cake." Instantly the whole staff disappeared into the ovens, and my
own head was held down in a seething cauldron. On returning to
consciousness, I learned that a dish of this sacred confection had
passed through on its way to his Majesty's table.
Although he had not, to my knowledge, taken a degree at either
of the two great English Universities, his delight in mechanical
science, conjuring tricks, &c., was remarkable and discriminating.
Not to mention a barrel-organ, studded with Koh-i-noors and con-
structed to play Daisy and the Intermezzo, a trifling gift which I
Eresented to him as a souvenir of our friendship, I recall the interest
e displayed in the three-card trick which I had the honour of ex-
hibiting before his astonished Court. The Knave was so delineated
as to represent the typical features of a Spaniard. The Bulbul's
friendly attitude to pur nation, and at the same time his happy vein
of humour, may be illustrated by a facetious observation which he
condescended to make at the time. "I prefer," he said in broken
Hollandaue, "I prefer your English fool to your Spanish knave."
As for the succession to the throne of Half-Kalf, I flatter myself
that I had always urged upon his Majesty the advisability of en-
couraging Socialistic sentiments among his subject i. Only as late as
the 34th day of the month Damaram I received a vellum postcard
from him asking for further information on the Cab Strike. But the
time was not yet ripe for such reform. Still, whatever the issue of
things, the new Government can count on my distinguished con-
sideration. The same I also extend, dear Sir, to you; preferring
however, to retain my incognito of

SCIENCE AT OXFORD.
I SENT my son to Oxford
To court the classic Muse,
To pick up knowledge of the world
And sound religious views.
Our family is ancient,
And Tory to the core;
I sent the boy to Christ Church,
Where I had been before.
And he went in for Science!
Diethylene - sulphide - methyl - sul-
phine-iodide:
Ca H« 0. Oh, I felt so mortified!
I do not understand it,
This scientific craze:
It's a thing we never heard about
In my old college days.
We hunted and we cricketed,
As gentlemen should do;
We spent our mornings on the
"Cher."
Our nights at whist and loo.
But we never dreamt of going in for
Science.
Mechanical, terrigenous, infra-
littoral, abysmal;
Stalactites, stalagmites—Circe! this
is dismal.
lie never cared for horses
Till my old hunter died,
And then I found my son and heir
Absorbed in its inside.
He doesn't care for hunting,
He classes hounds as " dogs ";
But he shows a horrid tendency
For collecting cats and frogs.
And that, he says, is because he has
gone in for Science.
METSCHINIKOFP'S phagocytosis, amoeboid
protozoa,
\tlantosaurus immanis—Oh, how I pity
NOAH!
Last night when we were smoking
He talked above my head.
I thought I 'd be paternal,
So I asked what he had read.
I quoted from my HORACE—
1 have the volume yet—
But that confounded rascal
Said, "Sir. you quite forget
That we never have any time for books of that
sort after we 've gone in for Science."
Confocal ellipsoids, hemispherical cavity,
Reciprocal radius vectors — this is sheer
depravity!
The Squire says his eldest
Is steady as can be;
He '11 marry in the county, and
Die M.F.H., J.P.
Young TOM, Sir THOMAS tells me,
Shall go to Sandhurst straight;
And we all know voung Lord HABRY
Has nought to do but wait.
But my son—well, he always was eccentric —
has gone in for Science.
Oxhsemoglqbin; Pre-dicrotic wave.
He's bringing my grey hairs with sorrow to
the grave.
So, when my neighbours ask me
About mi/ eldest son,
And what he's going to turn to
When his time at Oxford's done—
The English liar and Parliament?
And make himself a name ?—
I have to change the subject,
And I hang my head for shame,
Because how can I possibly tell them that one
of our family has taken honours in
Science?
That he calls a mushroom "saprophyte," and
my prize orchid " epiphyte.
I don't know what he's coming to! I wonder
if his head's quite right?

III.—THE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM.
A RALLY of fairest women,
Proud lady and humble quean,
And men clad in brave apparel
Of velvet and silken sheen.
An Emperor, bright with purple
And other delights arrayed,
Conversed with a lovely lady—
Some called her a " painted" maid.
Her dress was a dream of splendour,
Black, rose-colour, brown and grey;
But her painting was done by Nature,
AVhatever the gossips say.
There Burgundy's Duke was bending
Full low to the Queen of Spain—
In silver, and brown, and green robes
Her courtiers swelled her train.
And there stood a handsome Admiral,
As ever white ensign flew,
A little at sea whilst talking
To a common, or Girton, "Blue."
Hard by sat a grey old skipper
In dingy and sober vest,
Spinning yarns with his Lulworth cousin,
A rare and an honoured guest.
There mixed in the throng proud beauties
In livery rich and rare
Of claret with creamy borders;
The fairest where all were fair.
Ah me! There were lovely dresses.
Pearl-bordered and silver-washed,
Not made, I'm convinced, by mortals—
A conviction that won't be quashed.
And here was a glint of copper,
And yellow of clouded gold,
And glory of endliss colour,
Profusion of tints untold.
The brown of a maiden's ringlets,
The tortoiseshell of her comb,
The grey that in age her hair streaks,
The green of a woodland gnome.
The plumage of dainty peacocks,
Bright colours and homely dun,
And robes that were tipped with orange
Like hills by the setting sun.

Rude shock to my dreaming Muse—
It seems she has been inspired by
The Butterflies' rainbow hues f
DARK' EYES.
WHEN I saw you first the dart,
AVhich from Cupid's fingers flies,
Found a target in my heart,
Dear dork eyes.
Eyes to fire the hearts of men,
Be they foolish, be they wise.
I adore you now, as then,
Dear dark eyes.
Is that what I ought to do?
Though your mistress laughs or dies,
Sad or smiling, still are you
Dear dark eyes.
AArhen I went you showed some pain;
Will you gleam with glad surprise
If you see me once again,
Dear dark eyes?
If you don't, and show delight
At some other fellow's sighs.
Shall I hang myself ?. Not quite,
Dear dark eyes!
From his love, though he may pine,
No poor i>oe1 aster dies;
1 '11 adore some other tine,
Dear dark eyes.
I.est the other fellow's fist.
As in prize-fight—you (he prize—
Knock me down, though I resist,
Dear dark eyes.
Black my peepers with a blow,
AVhich Ihe boxer's art supplies;
Mine would then be also— oh
Dear!— dark eyes.

chamber (which had cost £500,000
to erect), to carry on the Colonial
business of Oceana.
There was some little diffi-
culty in electing a Speaker, as
no less than six sections of the
('onfederation claimed to bo spe-
cially represented. After an
hour's discussion (conducted
through speaking-trumpets so
that the speeches might be heard
in the reporters' gallery), half-
a-dozen gentlemen were chosen
to fill the Presidential chair,
which was replaced by a sofa
for their accommodation.
The Half-a-Dozen (in chorus)
then announced that the pro-
ceedings had commenced. They
would be pleased to hear if there
were any Bills stir le tapis.
The House was then addressed
by two hundred delegates from
Queensland. As they all spoke
at once, it was a little difficult
to understand the purport of
their observations, but it was
generally understood that the
delegates were in favour of
slavery, or, failing this, Coolie
labour.
Four hundred representatives
of Victoria and New South Wales
took an opposite view, and ex-
pressed their determination of
passing a Bill for establish-
ing the eight hours day, the
living wage, and the State-

A DAY IN THE COUNTRY.

assisted establishment of Trade
Unionism.
Several Premiers of various
colonies then proposed that the
Budget should be considered
before any other public business
was allowed to occupy the atten-
tion of the House.
Conversation having now be-
come general, eighteen Chan-
cellors of the Exchequer who
had come to an agreement an-
nounced on a huge screen, with
the assistance of a gigantic
magic lantern, the exact amount
of the Revenue.
On inquiry, it was ascertained,
amidst much laughter, that the
sum named would exactly pay
every delegate just a year's
salary.
By universal consent it was
agreed that a year's salary
should be paid to all present.
There being no other business
before the members, the House
adjourned until the time should
arrive for the discussion and
distribution of another Budget.
The proceedings terminated
with a salute of twenty-one
guns, which it was explained
on the screen was intended to
pass as a hearty vote of thanks
to those who had presided with
so much tact, urbanity, and dis-
tinction at these exceedingly-
interesting proceedings.
MKS. R. was so sorry to hear
that the little boy who fell off
the ladder on to his head had
got to be japanned. On inquir-
ing at the hospital, she was glad
to learn that he was progressing
favourably under the antisceptio
treatment.

OPERA NOTES.
Monday.— Werther by MASSENET. Thus inspired, the Opera
Goer breaketh forth into rhythmic praise:—
KM M v EAMES is singing Charlotte,
Goody-goody, not a flitter,
And 'tis Brother .1 KAN UK RESZKE
Takes the part of warbling Werther.
ABNOLBSON sings Sophie sweetly;
First rate Baitti CASTELMABY;
ALBEUS good as Charlotte's husband.
Thus completes a caste quite starry.
Boyish choristers sing " Noel!"
Listening to this choir of laddies
Doth recall old Herr VON JOEL
When our youth was Green, at" Paddy's."
DRTTHIOLANUS back has ta'en us
To the days when we were perter
And the poem Thackerayan
Kead we on the Woes of Werther.
Than the merry MANCINELLI
Can conductor be alerter?
Chorus, band, arrangements scenic,
Perfect are for Warbling Werther!
Wednesday.—Romeo et Juliette, House crowded. This house
quite equal to the two Houses of CAPULETS (Lords) and MONTAGUES
(Commons). Royalty present, and evidently much pleased, as who
could help being, witn MELBA at her best, and the Brothers DE
REPZKE in most excellent form. Happy Thought. Instead of basket
of flowers, handed up at end of Act II., why not hand up basket
full of something really useful, say vegetables? Considering the
poor season it has been, a basket of the very best green asparagus,
the smallest and sweetest peas, and the moat minute and narrowest
of broad beans, with some rare hothouse fruit, a few jars of real
turtle, and a prime saddle of mutton, would be something worthy
the acceptance of a prima donna! But as the Priest of Venus says in
OFFENBACH'S La Belle Helihte, "Trap defeurs! Trap defleun.'.'"
Far more acceptable than even the most gigantic bouquet, would be
the substantial trophy—"a trophy" suggestive of everything the
very opposite of anything like " atrophy"—which we have suggested.
Touching, too, to see the nabUues bringing such gifts in carriages and
cabs, and the servants of the establishment jealously guarding them
in their passage under the stage to the orchestra! A few fresh
lobsters with prime green salad would add to the artistic effect, and
make the baskets, so handed up, a tight for Gods in the gallery, a
delight for "the Diva," and the envy of everybody everywhere.
LrciLE HILL, as Stephana, looks pretty, singing prettily. Merry
MANCINELLI all there, and more,
Friday.—Lohengrin. MELBA as Elsa. Mr. WAGSTAFF observes,
"She is bright and effervescent as seltzer." WAOSTAFF to be sup-
pressed, as he will whisper these very soft nothings to me during acts,
and people look round at him indignantly. Worst is, he chuckles
audibly. EDWAKD BE RESZKE noble as tie King, that is if he be a
king, though must own to never having discovered what sort of
a dignity " F I'ccellatnre" is meant to be. However, he appears to be
six foot six by four, and take him as length and breadth he is every
inch a king. Herr WALDMANN is VA raldo del Re, a part which, as there
is only one pong in it, just suits one Herr. JOHN BE RESZKE tries to
makehimeelf look flaxen and effeminate as the S wan-Hopperat ic Knight
but, thank goodness, does not succeed, but sings and plays in a grandly
masculine manner. ANCONA so dramatic as Freddy Telramondo
(" Who was Ramondo f" asks that chuckle-headed WAOSTAFF, " and
what did who have to Tell him?" Down, WA GSTAFF, down!) as to make
this part quite lively; while GIULIA RAVOCH, marvellously made
up as the intruding Ortruda, ('''Aught ruder than she is"
Hufh! Irrepressible WAGSTAFF; and he subsides with a Puck-like
chuckle- a difficult combination of words, and liable to be uttered as
"a chuek-like Puckle"), is undeniably powerful histrionically, even
if her tinging be not absolute perfect. "Chorus, if you please,
ladies and gentlemen," excellent, as usual, and Signer MANCINELLI
Meritorious and Monarchical, but here and there apparently Morose
and Miserable, turning with a frown and with energetic action, as
if remonstrating with the left-hand portion of the orchestra for doing
or not doing something or other, which fault, if fault it were on
either side, escaped the notice of the learned musical Thebans in
front of the House. Fine performance of Opera, but very wet per-
formance ("a down-ponr-formance," says WAGOTAFF, whom I will
not take with me in my cab) outside.
Saturday.—VERDI'S Falstaff " going strong." Sir DRURIOLANUS
looks in from rehearsal of German Opera, nas a conversation in
German, Italian, French, Chinese, Russian, Spanish, and Siamese,
with afewfriendsof various nationalities in the house; but, as GILBERT
("W. S.," not "YVETTK") sang, "In spite of all temptations To
i* l<>ng to other nations, He remains an Englishman!" Brayvo!
A JOVE-IAL EXTRAVAGANZA.
THE Cambridge May Week this
year seriously marred by rain, but
nothing could damp the spirits of
visitors, who showed themselves to
be not at sea by going to the A. D. C.
there to see Jupiter, LL.D., an
original mythological musical ei-
travaganza. The LEHMANN element
supplied by the author, the music
composed by Mr. TERHUS NOBLE,
the 9rganist of Ely Cathedral. Most
musical pieces nowadays a collection
of excellent "turns." "One good
turn deserves another" and the
thing's done. Jupiter. LL.D., not
at all like that. The took a capital
coherent story. A Cambridge Vice-
Chancellor—the Vice men most de-
test— Dr. RumbnldQ&i. A. H. HALL)
and an undergraduate Arthur Henry
Halifax—so named that the heroine
may call him "Arthur " in the first
two acts and go to Halifax in the
third, and played with great spirit
and skill by Mr. C. E. MAHTINEAU—
go to Olympia to beg all the gods
and goddesses to come to Cambridge
to get their LL.D. They arrive there

prising adventures with the girls and principal of (Pretty) Maida Hall.
All roads, of course, lead to the Great Court of Trinity, which
made a beautiful Third Act, with a
procession of newly-made Doctors
and Dootresses, which made one
hopeful for the future of learning.
The bedmakers, Mr. R. A. AUSTEN
LEIGH and Mr. A. L. HARRISON,
really immensely funny. Both
have, it is rumoured, since received
offers of important engagements
from a leading College. Mr. LEH-
MANN'S songs went with the utmost
dash. So much rhyme that there
was no sign of a frost. Mr. NOBLE'S
music as graceful and pretty as the
A. D. C. ladies. Hebe (the Hon.
F. W. G. EGEBTON), who had got
her blue, and wore it, was charm-
ing in a leading part, whilst the
two goddesses, Juno (Mr. T. BAL-
FOUB) and Venus (Mr. F. G.
B'HAUTEVILLF.), looked divine.
It's a way goddesses have. The
whole affair a great domestic
triumph for the A. D. C., a per-
sonal one for Mr. LEHMANX and
Mr. NOBLE. These two gentlemen
responsible for a good deal. For
all men now swear—by Jupiter,
LL.D. And one who swears as
loudly as any may, perhaps, as
coming from the bister University, not untruly assert he was
OXFORB IN CAMBRIDGE.

First Bedmaker.
MOORE ANB DOWNS.—-At the Grand Steeplechase de Paris, as we
gather from the St. James's Gazette's Sporting Notes, " Mr. TONY'
MOOKE'S colours were sported for the first time, but the horse was
unplaced." The colours of Mr. "Pofrr" MOOKE, the celebrated
Christy Minstrel, would of course be " black on white" as they say
at pool. As the horse didn't win, there were no winners or losers,
and no bettor will, in consequence, be able to consider himself as all
the better off for having one "pony more" in his pocket. "The
Minstrel Boy tn the race has gone. And he's left his bones behind
him," is what they ought henceforth to sing at St. James's Hall if
the old established " Corner Man" is to become a regular "Tatten-
tiam-Corner Man," and to go in for the "Bettor Land," Winner
first, Moore to follow.

The Modern Amphitryon to the Up-to-Date
Diner- Out:—
COME dine with me on Monday week,
And we will all the pleasures seek
That a prime cook, and cellar good,
May yield to one in dining mood.
We shall sit down a jolly eight
(My " octagons " you 've not tried of late),
I 've asked JACK SPBATTE, and the DE
BOORES,
MUNDUNOCS and the MADREPORES.
No silver dishes for thy meat,
Bat—you '11 find something good to eat!
And on the table there shall be
No cheap champagne, take that from me!
I know you love a first-rate smoke,
The oldest wine, the newest joke;
And if delights like these you seek,
Come dine with me next Monday week!
The Up-(o-l)ute Diner-Out's Reply to the
Modern Amphitryon,
IK feeds were scarce, and I were young,
And truth on each Amphitryon's tongue,
Your pretty note might make me seek
To dine with you next Monday week.
But time runs on, I 'm growing old.
And dullard guests, and dishes cold,
Make hospitality all a hum,
So I '111 afraid I cannot come.
Pardon delay in my reply!
I always let a week slip by
Before response to such a letter,
Since any day may bring a better!
You saw the tip of " Diner-Out"
Who wrote unto the Times, no doubt?
Procrastination is time's thief,
But gives the diner-out relief.
No thanks, old man! And since you wrote
I 've had the friendliest little note
From Lady MADGE,—sly little sinner !—
And—well, you know her style of dinner!
There I shall meet no pursey bores,
Or mutton-witted MADREPORES;
So, as I love the smart and chic,
I dine with her on Monday week.
Of course, dear boy, had nothing better
Turned up since I received your letter,
Why/««<e de mieux, I yet might seek
To dine with you next Monday week.
A ROAD TO THE CODE.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—So many codes have
recently been published to simplify the send-
ing of telegraphjc messages, that it seems
necessary to furnish one that may be used by
all the world. Such a work is now in active
preparation. I am the compiler. The fol-
lowing (which are not unlike entries in other
codes) are a few examples of its contents : —
Coif Word. Explanation.
POLITE . . You cannot possibly dine with
us this evening, as there will be
thirteen at table if you come.
Besides, we have not the right
set to meet you. You are dull
and uninteresting. We may as
well be frank and open, and it
would be gross flattery to say
anvtHng else.
AKGEL . . The man in possession refused
to go out, and has taken to
smoking in the back drawing-
room. He has got the key of the
bookcase, and is thumbing the
original edition of RUSKIS'S
Seren Lampt of Architecture,
and the Stones of Venice.
CATSPAW . We arrive in Paris at 7.45,
breakfast at the table d'hote at
the Grand at 11.30. and visit the
JardindesPlantes before leaving
for Basle in the evening.
BEAUTY. . Yes. your brother nas come
back from New Zealand. He
managed to borrow half-a-sove-
reign from Uncle JACK, and has
walked off with the watchman's
supper. This last outrage has
caused a terrible row, and may
bring him before a magistrate.
FIREWORKS . We shall go to the Abbey in
the morning, St. Paul's in the
afternoon, and perhaps dine at
the Albany Club in the evening.
If we go to Kingston, we may
return in Lord DASHOVER'S four-
in-hand.
BOTTLE . . The children are going to
school at Dr. BIRCH'S. Thev are
required to take six towels, a
fork, spoon, and knife, and the
customary outfit. French is nn
extra, but drilling is thrown in.
The matron is a Mrs. BROWN, a
widow, whoM husband was killed
in the Mutinv.
FREEDOM . Certainly buy for the rise, as
Mexicans have declared a feeble
dividend. British Railways and
Foreigners still doubtful. Grey
shirting dull, and nothing doin#
in the silver market.
There, Sir! I have picked out a word here
and there, so that you may see the modus
operandi. Yours verv truly,
A I'RACTICAI. MA*.

And growing yet more charming daily.

In country garden bright with flowers,
Where falling blossoms flutter down
Upon thy head in scented showers.
I dream of thee where skies are blue;
I feel an eager hope of winning
Thy heart, so tender and so true,
A heart incapable of sinning.
I can but dream of all thy charm,
Until at last we are together;
I fear lest cold should do thee harm
In this uncertain, changeful weather.
I dream— perhaps it is not right,
And I am an abandoned sinner —
Of some not distant summer night
When thou wilt come to me to dinner.

Why, it's a fore-quarter of prime Canterbury

ture of broad beans, onions, tomatoes, gum
arabic, and cellulose. Mv bean-butcher re-
commends it strongly. May I tempt you?
Do try my pulse—not medically, of course!
Well, on second thoughts, perhaps I should
feel safer with some of those South-Down

Why not strike out a new line, and go in

It is certified by a specialist to contain five

barous old sirloin of beef.
You are too kind. But my doctor tells me
to avoid nitrogen, and only take carbonaceous

PREHISTORIC PEEPS.
A NIGHT LECTURE ON EVOLUTION.
LETTER TO A DEBUTANTE.—III.
Mr DEAR GLADYS,—You have made great, progress lately, and I
FCC you are acquiring a sense of proportion and a feeling of that rela-
tive value of your acquaintances that varies so subtly according to
time and place. Captain MASHINGTOX, for instance, admirable in a
ball-room, useful at Hurlingham, and adequate in the Park, is
nobody, and completely "out of it," at FLORIAN HATE'S Studio
afternoons, where it's a privilege to be noticed by ARCHIE
WJEBDSLI.Y, and a distinction to get a word with ADRIAN CLIVE.
These gentlemen are fashionable and entertaining; yet, if there is a
tinge of the romantic about their hair, or anything too vivid and
dramatic as to their button-holes, they would not be appreciated,
pay, at LORD'S, at the Eton and Harrow cricket match, wnere they
would shudder at the crude shades of blue, and Captain MASHINGTOS
would be in his element.
Wherever you may be, I trust you never snub a faithful, fan-
holding, wire-sending, ice-fetching old friend—(by old friend, I
mean, in Ixradon, anyone you have met four or five times)—it's
unkind; and you never know when you may require him.
Your last letter was quite exciting. So you have had your first
proposal! And from the serious man who does conjuring tricks.
And you refused him—incoherently, but tirmly— at a Wagner
concert.
I cannot jity him. He brought it on himself, by sending you his
book on South Africa. But why were you disappointed at the way
he did it? What had you been reading? Did you think he would
kneel on one knee, and say, "Miss KEtcsixoroN—GLADYS—may I call
you GLADYS?" (or words to that efftet)—" In short,—I love you!"
People don't say, " In short." nor kneel, nowadays. You say he
is going away, to get over it. I suppose to Brighton, from Saturday
till Monday.
And now, about CapfainMAsmNGTON? You seem to see him very
often. By a series of miraculous accidents he is always "crossing
your path," as Ihey say in melodrama, and you are never out when
he calls. You repeat to me remaiks of his really unworthy of quota-
tion in pen an ink, and altogeth(r, I fear you have u weakness for
him. I am anxious, because I know him to be "hard up," liable to
be "ordered off" at any moment, and entirely unsuited to the
profeesii n of marriage. Think, my dear GLADYS.
Would you like a long engagement? with letters by every mail for
six years while BERTIE (I daresay his name is BKKTIE) U out in some
distant savage country, subject to fever and forget fulness? Or
would you like to marry now—at eighteen—and perhaps go out, say,
to Bermuda with Captain MASHIXGTON—in the middle of the season,
for instance? He would tlirt on. board with ladies old enough to be
your mother, and you would be far too ill even to dress well enoush to
annoy them. That excellent valsing that charms you now would be
the greatest annoyance to you after your marriage—you can't dance
with your husband, remember. So to marry him for that would be
short-sighted indeed.
You are not very good at characterization, GLADYS. What a long
word! but I mean that your descriptions are disconnected, and from
them I can form onlv a vague idea of your new admirer, Mr.
KLTSINGELDER. What I hear, on the whole, I rather like.
"Said but good-tempered—better-looking really than he seems,"
Curious—one would have thought good looks really a matter about
which one might judge by appearances. But, let that pass. "Plays
the bassoon, but very little, and only in private." One can't play
the bassoon, even " in private," without it s being noticed—unfortu-
nately. Are you sure it is the bassoon?
"Drives a draff, and has asked you and Lady TAYMER io go to
Kanefaqh. Gives huge dinner-parties, on Sundays, at the Saroy.
Sends fovers, and makes jokes. As he is rery rich, and has nothing
whatever to do, it is supposed he trill never hare time to marry.
The music is against him, but we all have our faults. What style of
humour does he indulge in? Does he make jokes you have heard
before, or only the kind you do not wish to hear again? He sent yon

Amis, LEGS, AND THE MANX-

his letter to a Manxman, who had
written to inquire if H. L., M.P.,
suggested the cession of the Isle
of Man to Germany, with this
explanation :—" It was what i«
called ' argitmentum absiirdum.'"
But it is not so called; the phrase
is "argwnentum ad abrurdum."
"LABBY" had only to add " ad."
If the Manxman were a poet, he
would have been inspired to send
a reply in a couplet—
Many thanks, man,
From your Manxman.
But there is no record of his
having done so. The island will
not he ceded to Germany. The
"House of Keys" is safe,—no
deadlock; and the Manxman will
not have to subtract from the Manx
Arms, and will not have to sur-
render even one of his three legs.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FBOM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, June 11.—Affecting scene just
now between Cap'en TOMMY BOWLES and the Chair. Clause IV.
of Budget Bill having been under discussion since Friday night.
Amendments finally disposed of. On question that Clause be added
to Bill, Ihe blameless BABTLEY blandly moved its rejection. Then
the CAP'EN hove to, fired off stupendous speech, just as if on succes-
sive Amendments to Clause he had not delivered a doxen others.
MELLOB having been carried out in comatose state, ROBY temporarily
in Chair. At end of first twenty words, hailed the CAI>'F.S; ordered
him to clew up. CAF'EN held his course as before; ROHY fired shot
across his bows.
"I will," said the CAP'EN for only response, "give the Committee
a last illustration."
"I have to request the hon. gentleman not to proceed," said the
CHAIRMAN, sternly.
Here was a crisis. If the CAP'EIT, after this warning, still held
on, the CHAIRMAN, who had trained his heavy guns, would certainly
sink TOMMY'S light craft, or, taking it in tow, would dock him in
the Clock Tower. Yet there were the widow and the orphan to be
thought of. TOMMY, as he told the Committee, had compiled set of
tables which showed how these were wronged by the Budget Bill.
He had brought the tables in with him, one under each arm. As he
walked with them up floor of the House (" Looking," so SAHK said,
"like one of the pictures in old Bibles of MOSES coming down from
the Mount with the Tables of the Law "), the widow and the orphan
tugged at TOMMY'S heartstrings. He looked wistfully at ROBY to
see if he really meant businessi Coming to the conclusion that he
did, Cap'en TOMMY heaved a sigh, then heaved his anchor, and
forged away out of range of CHAIRMAN'S battery.
Business done.—Clause IV. added to Budget Bill.
Tuesday.—A few weeks ago HERBERT MAXWELL interrupted his
literary labours to call attention to marked increase of Scotch
accent in places of popular resort at height of Ix>ndon season. Seems
the peculiarity not altogether unconnected with habit of bailies and
other pawky persons in high places in municipalities and parishes to
vote themselves certain sums of money out of the rates, sufficient to
cover expenses of visit to London. Ostensible occasion for journey is
to keep an eye upon proceedings in Scotch Grand Committee. Inci-
dentally, being on the spot, and obeying the national instinct not to
lose anything, even if it be only an opportunity, they take a look round
at other places. A visit to London always hampered by reflection on
experience of the famous explorer—wasn't he our dear CHARLES
KEENE'S acquaintance ?—who nadn't been in the place ten minutes
when " bang went saxpence." To be in the place for a fortnight
with the ratepayers' saxpences going bang for your entertainment
and instruction is quite another thing.
HERBERT MAXWELL'S implications received confirmation from
unexpected source. THE MACOBEGOR has his eye upon two members
of Deer Forest Commission whom he has accidentally met at Exeter
Hall, or other place of public resort, when they were understood to
be in the Highlands a hunting the Deer Forest Owner. Asked a
question on subject the other day. Secretary for Scotland affected
to know nothing of circumstance. Subject seemed to drop; THE
MACGREOOR, according to his wont at periods of personal or political
excitement, took the 'bus to Hampstead; walked for a while on
the heath; came down to House this afternoon refreshed and filled

with mighty resolve. Did TREVELYAN mean to have those two
Commissioners stalked, run down, tied up, and conveyed to scene
of their duties in Scotland, or would he forbear? TREVELYAN
concluded he'd forbear.'
Then up rose THE MACGREGOR, drew his claymore and swore on
its hilt a great oath that henceforward the Government must
count him their foe. Putting it in Parliamentary phrase and
sheathing the claymore, THE MACGREGOR said: “In consequence
of the reply of the right hon. gentleman I beg to give notice that

reply, in the interests of my constituents, I shall feel it my duty

watched THE MACGREGOR stride forth to vote against Government
in Committee on Budget Bill.
SQUIRE OF MALWOOD, usually keen to scent a joke, didn't seem
to see the fun. “It's dull work here just now,” he said, "and
if a donkey suddenly brays the bored House gratefully goes off
into a fit of laughter. But this sort of thing has also its serious
side. You remember, TOBY, what BISMARCK said the other day,
chatting with five hundred veterans from Holstein who, passing
by Friedrichsrub, halted to salute the maker of Germany ?
Talking about attacks made on him in the press the old warrior
said he cared nothing about the criticisms of his opponents. It
was when friends turned upon him that he felt the hopeless-
ness of further strife. When the French shot at us,' he said,
it was a matter of course, and if one was wounded one was taken
to the hospital. But when we are shot at from behind, from
our own ranks, that is another thing. This often happens to me
in politics.' It still oftener happens here, and makes the life of
a Liberal Leader not worth living."

A SARA-SCENIC SHOW.
WELCOME to SARA as Izeyl,—" with the dot lets on the y,"—and
welcome to SARA generally, what-
ever she may play. She may not,
perhaps, be quite so ethereal as here-
tofore, she may be a trifle more soli-
dified, but " for a' that and a' that,"
SARA is SARA, the same incomparable
SARA. There is nothing particularly
new in Izeyl, a poetical tragical
drama in verse and four acts. Its
first two scenes are as tranquilising
as a scientific lecture, and as pretty
as a pastoral dissolving view. Kepre-
presenting the converted courtesan,
SARA is the same sweet, magnetising,
purring person, with an occasional
fit of tiger-cat just to enliven the
otherwise drowsy proceedings.
It is not till we come to the Third
Act that there is anything at all
approaching a dramatic sensation.
Scyndia (M. DENECBOTJBG), the gay
young spark, who, as his mother, the
remarkably fine Princess (Madame
MARTHOLD) thinks, goestobedat eight,
and remains there, comes to IzeyFs
palatial residence, and brings with
him a handsome present for her of
all sorts of, apparently, Palais Royal
jewellery, and imitation coins in large
boxes. The gifts the still fascinating
but recently converted courtesan at
once hands over to the poor, whom she
has always with her, in the shape of
a crowd of invisible beggars waiting
outside, all cheering loudly, and no
wonder, at the distribution of this
largesse by the hands of one Yoghi,
a sort of Bogie-man, well played by
M. DfiMAX. But the young Scyndia,
being on pleasure bent,| and evi-
dently not " of a frugal mind," like
JOHNNIE GILPIN, has also ordered
in, from the nearest Stores, a sump-
tions supper, consisting apparently
of " pine-apples for one," and several
dishes of more or less ripe fruit, with
a few empty goblets—"No Bottles
to-day,"—aU placed on a portable
table, which is bronght in by handy
attendants, also probably hired from
the waiter-supplying greengrocer's.
But Izeyl, naving turned from
the error of her ways, is, so to speak,
"living with mother now," and re-
fuses the prof erred supper. Moreover,
she rejects with scorn the amorous
advances of the gay young Prince,
who, becoming still gayer and more
amorous every minute, exclaims in
the language of ancient melodrama,
"I must and will possess her!"

incontinently rushes to embrace his victim. But Izeyl recalls a
situation curiously like this in La Tosca. table and all included, and
so snatching a queer sort of triangular dagger from Scyndia's belt,
she poignards him sharply, fatally;
and from being all life and energy
down goes Scyndia dead as the pro-
verbial door-nail. With dramatic
prescience he falls close to the table,
and in a few minutes the distracted
Izeyl on hearing, like Lady Mac-
beth, "a knocking at the door,"
partly drags him underneath the
table, partly drags the table over
him, and as a happy thought,"
being a person of considerable re-
sources, she, at the last moment, ma-
nages to hide his legs, which are
sticking out awkwardly, under the
tablecloth.
Enter the stout Pi-incest, who, in
the character of the mother un-
aware of her son being out, has a
pleasant confidential chat with the
interesting convert to Buddhism,
during which poor Sci/ndia has to lie
under the table, (rather trying this
for an actor who would be "np and
doing,") and then she suddenly dis-
covers the truth. The infuriated
Princess orders Izeyl off to be
tortured, and to have a lot of
pleasant things done to her pre-
vious to being publicly exposed—
which no adventuress likes—in the
desert.
In the last Act, all we see is poor
Izeyl gone to the desert with her
eye out—both eyes out; but as there
is no trace of hot irons, nor any sign
of any cruelty having been inflicted
on her body, she seems to be none
the worse for what ever may have
happened to her—indeed, she is just
a trifle more purring and fascinating
than ever. There she sits, in a light
and airy chemise, which, considering
her fragile form, may be described
as "next to nothing," or almost so,
while a few rude persons—idlers, of
course—stand by and jeer at her.
Then the mad enthusiast, the cause
of all this trouble, enters, and pats
her on the head, but the Prince,
suddenly entering, dismisses Yoghi-
Bogie, "has a love scene with the
unfortunate Izeyl, who still ap-
pears to be more of the courtesan
than the convert, and who finally

of course, anatomically, is quit*

that "the merry comedy was received with enthusiasm by a large
audience, not the least appreciative members of which were Mr.
IRVING and Miss ELLEN TERRY." Presumably the Randolphian
banqueting hour was eight to half-past, coinciding with the hour of
the performance at the Gaiety. Party and Play last about the same
time, so how did HENRY IRVING manage to be present at both at
once? Has he a double? Or is it a Mephistophefian mystery?

microbes in a third-class carriage as in a first-class. Well, then, the

House of Lords, Monday, June 18. — Quite a big muster of Peers
to-night. Looking round Conservative Benches, seemed evident that
either Church or Land was in danger. Turned out to be neither.
It was Cambridge University that had whipped up noble Lords and
one Bishop in support of plenary powers of police on pavements of
university town. Of the three score Peers who rallied round the
dons, there were some to whom Cambridge is Alma Mater. If only
the talk had gone back to days of yore, and bench had echoed to
bench tales of Undergraduate days, what a charming evening
we might have had_! County GUT could have told the House
something of Cambridge in the Exhibition year, and " ROWTON on
Running would have supplied a thrilling chapter of incident.
More than half a century since RUTLAND was at Oxford, his soul
distilling deathless verse. Through the ages still rings his famous
battle cry-
Let wealth and commerce, laws and learning die,
But leave UH still our old nobili-ty.
But though an Oxford man, the old Duke spoke up for Cambridge,
flaunting the idea that the police at Cambridge would be less discri-
minating than the police at Oxford. Ah! how discriminating they
were when WILLIAM THE FOURTH was King, and a gold-chain-
bedbiened youth, with hair curled and oiled like an Assyrian bull,
joined forces with JOHN MA.VNKIIS to save his adopted country.
_ Peculiarity of the Debate was the severe manner in which oil and
vinegar ran their appointed courses. No political question at issue;
yet into one lobby streamed the Tories to a man, while into another
the PREMIER led his scanty flock. Business done. — Commons still
boring themselves to death round Budget.
Tuesday. — " This Committee," said Sir RICHARD EVEBARD
WEBSTER, of Pump Court, Tem-
ple, "is all h - and TOMMY."
Never so shocked in my life.
Remark obvious. Anyone else
might have made it; but not the
almost Reverend Member for Isle
of Wight. Fancy WEBSTEB must
have read expression in my face.
"All HANBUBY and TOMMY
BOWLES I mean," he added,
hastily.
That's so. There's also what
the Scotch call "a bittock" of
BYRNE and BUTCHER, BARTLEY
and BOUSFIELD, not to mention
NAPOLEON BONAPARTE BOLTON,
who is always turning up the
night before Austerlitz, or the
morning after Marengo, with an
Amendment under his cloak, or a
new sub-section hidden in his
famous chapeau grit. Also there
is JOKIM, PRINCE ARTHUR, and the
SQUIRE OF MALWOOD. On slightest
provocation they vary proceedings
by triangular duel. Difference
between their practice and the
famous ease reported in nautical
history is, that PRINCE ARTHUR
in tne House of Common,!
The interlude occurs once or twice in dull sitting, with unexpected-
ness that invests it with additional charm. To-night HANBURY,
determined that Cap'en TOMMY should not make all the running,
moved Amendment in speech of considerable length. The SQUIRE
contemptuously dismissed it as not seriously meant. If it were
carried, he showed, it would make nonsense of the Bill. JOKIM cut to
the quick by this punishment of an inoffensive friend. Took the
SQUIRE by the collar (of course, in the Parliamentary sense), and
savagely shook him, declaring in excited voice that " the Bill would
make better progress if the CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER could
only keep his temper."
The SQUIRE blandly retorted, "Here's the EX-CHANCELLOR OF
TEE EXCHEQUER going to vote against imposing a penalty for a
breach of the revenue laws 1"
"That's," cried JOKIM, jumping to his feet, and glaring across
the table at the bland presence on the other side; "That's a I
mean, the right hon. gentleman makes a statement which is abso-
lutely contrary to fact."
Don't know what we should do without these little breezes.
Sometimes PRINCE ARTHUR joins in, endeavouring, as he puts it,
to re-establish order, broken by the wanton conduct of SQUIRE OF

MALWOOD. As for that eminent statesman, he is in the wrong
whatever course he takes. If in his place in active charge of the
Bill he is told that things go much better when he is away, and
ATTORNEY-GENERAL or SOLICITOR-GENERAL looking after things
from Treasury Bench. He humbly goes away to partake of hasty
and inadequate dinner; when he apologetically comes back WEBSTER
turns upon him with inquiry " at what period of the evening has the
CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER bestowed on the Committee the
privilege of his views on the Bill?"
"Hit high or hit low I can't please them, TOBY. The only thing
that sustains me in trying circumstances is the consciousness of
rectitude and the gift of an equable temper."
Buitiness done—Clause IX. added to Budget Bill.
Wednesday.—" Is JOHN MOHLEY speaking?" I asked the Member
for BARK who hod just left the House.
"No," he said; "T. W. RUSSELL is interrupting."
Irish debate on; interpolated between incessant courses of Budget.
Odd to note how welcome the variety is. Time was when men used
to complain of the parliamentary fare being toujours Irlande. Now
positively jump at opportunity of talking about something else than
Death Duties. Debate marked by breezy speech from HORACE
PLUNKETT. PLUNKETT is Member for division of Dublin County.
He is of the bluest landlord blood; his father's barony one of the
oldest in Ireland. SHIFT MACNEILL, in his historical researches into
family history of peers who voted down Home-Rule Bill last year,
will find no such proud record as is preserved in a fifteenth century
manuscript touching HORACE PLUNKETT'S forefathers. "Theyre be
two Ionics PLrNKETTE," so it runs, "one of Killyn and the other of
Donsane, and itte dot lie soe happen that hee who shalle passe safely
by Killyn, shall be robbed at Donsane. and hee who shalle passe
safely by Donsane shalle be robbed at Killyn."
Hence it will appear that PLUNKETT speaks on Irish affairs with
all the authority that belongs to respectable lineage. What he had
to sav just now was, that the feeling all over Ireland at the present
time has far more healthy tone than ever before. Times unques-
tionably better now than within recent memory.
"To that end," savs SARK, "there is no man who has contributed
more than HORACE PLUNKETT. He has given himself up wholly to
establishing on sound basis his system of co-operation amongst Irish
farmers, large and small, for sale of produce. Already he has
worked the miracle of not only inducing Irish agriculturists to trust
each'other, but to trust a working Committee that includes some
landlords. DIZZY, vou remember, once talked about 'POPKINS'
Plan.' Best thing I 've heard of for long time is PLUNKETT'S Plan.
If we had a few more Irish Members like HORACE PLUMCKTT we
would soon have no Irish Question." Business done.—JOHN MOR-
LEY'S salary voted in undiminished sum.
Friday.—Gaiety of House, chastened by successive weeks in
Committee on Budget Bill, eclipsed by announcement that LOTJLU
HABCOURT is about to retire from political life, with intent to become
"^something in the City." This course of procedure not unknown in
history of the world. Seem to remember something about Crx-
CINNATUS and a plough. Also TEMPLE (not Sir RICHARD) went to
Sheen, and after governing a nation, took to cultivating roses. But
these things happened late in life, when statesmen were worn with
strife, and had built up a mighty record of accomplished work.
During the last five or six years LOULU had done more than meets
the eye. In the organisation of the party and, later, at the Treasury,
he has accomplished work the amount and value of which are hidden
under more than a bushel of modesty. Still, he is only on thresh-
hold of what promised to be a useful, even a brilliant political career.
Now he gives it up, and will go down every morning in a 'bus to the
City. 'f Won't you linger longer, LOULU f"
Ah TOBY," he said, passing his hand across his fevered brow,
"I cannot. I am the thrall of Ambition. 'Tis a cursed passion ; but
it possesses me and I cannot exorcise it. You see, if I went into
Parliament and devoted myself to political life I might become
Chancellor of the Exchequer even as my father is. If I go into the
City and set myself diligently to work, I may in time become Lord
Mayor. There is the secret of a decision which has puzzled other
people besides you."
Businets done.—On Clause XVI. Budget Bill.
A DOUBLE'D DUTY.—Matchbox for the Grand Prix represented an
English horse belonging to a German. Wasn't it the duty of every
good Frenchman to bet any amount of odds against that horse 'f
Why, certainly. But oddly enough, it was 6 to 4 on Matchbox, and
that Matchbox should lose was a lesson to such Frenchmen as had
preferred pockets to patriotism.
MEM. FOR NEXT COMMKir. AT OXFORD.—As the "procession of
boats" is now omitted from the programme, why not substitute for
it " a review of Scholar-ships"?

OPERA NOTES.
Monday.—Faust, in Italian and French, by the "Combination
Opera Company." ESTMA EAMES as Marguerite, with her own hair,
not (he usual flaxen tails—but that's another tale. It is difficult to
get a real sood representative of Faust, and Mons. COSSIBA is not the
ideal for the part. PiAxgoN good as ever as the bad spirit, Mephisto.

opera La Navarraise afterwards. Let this Opera-Noter at once

success, no doubt of it. It was written for Madame CAI.VK, and
Madame CALVK did the part, the librettists, and the composer full
justice.

drew my objection. For once WAGSTAFF was right; it is an ex-
cellent work. Madame CALVE'S Anita, La Nararraise, is a com-
panion picture to her Santuzza; but there can be no comparison
between this work of MASSENET'S and that by MASCAGNI. There
is not much that, at a first hearing, "catches on" musically as
there is in MASCAOHI'S work, where the very first air sung behind
the scenes takes the audience at once, and then,—not to mention the
several striking numbers in the first part,—the intermezzo, which is
hard to beat, and which I venture to opine still stands alone, and has
not yet been beaten; though, by the way, it has been ground into our
ears by the organ-grinders until it has been nearly reduced to the
level of " Tft-ra-ra-booin-de-at/," which by now has had it's "de-ay,"
and has died a natural death.
No better evening's tntertainment could DinnuoLAJrus provide
than some short opera to cbtnmence with at 8 or 8..'iO (not Orffo,
but Philemon et Baucis) to be followed at 10, or thereabouts, by La MR. JOHN HAKE'S MOTTO AT THE GARJUCK TIIEATBE.-

by Caralleria Rusticana. The short opera is on the triple-bill
principle, and chimes in with our late dining hours or early closing
restrictions.
Madame CALVE, as Anita ("Anne Hater," observes WAGSTAFF,
"is not a bad name for a big peasant woman"), is simplyjperfect.

ment was received with acclamation.
FATAL FLOWERS.
ACCORDING to M. JOAX most of the ills that flesh is heir to are due
to the injudicious inhaling of the perfume of various flowers. This
being so, the following " conversation with a medical man" should
be added to the " Dialogue Books" of all foreign languages :—
Doctor. And now, my friend, what is the matter with you?
Patient. I have pains in my head, and shooting aches in all my
limbs. My hair has come off from my scalp, and one of my arms is
withered.
Doctor. It is clear to me that you must have been inhaling a
bouquet of roses.
Patient. Well, yes, I certainly was in a conservatory the other
evening, where there were a number of flowers. Can I do nothing to
effect a cure?
Doctor. You must take a voyage to Australia in a sailing-ship
which touches at no ports, and from which all plants have been
excluded. And now, is there anything else you wish to mention?
Patient. Why yes, Doctor. The other day I was dining at a
friend's, and after we had finished the dessert I found that I could
only speak with difficulty, and that the fioor was undulating, and the
room generally unsteady. I put this down to the salmon and a piece
of bread that I had eaten, instead of my customary biscuit. Was I
right in this assumption '<
Doctor. No, my good friend. No doubt the condition which you
describe was caused by inhaling your button-hole. And now fare-

A TF.Npini-nEARTED PRELATE.—At a meeting called to consider
the advisibilityof sending money and missionaries to assist struggling
Assyrian Christians, the Archbishop of CANTERBURY observed that
"he knew nothing more tragic than a once great, powerful, and
wide-spread church like this becoming so reduced that its bishops
hud occasionally to work in the fields." Why "tragic"? Their
work in the fields is only " occasional." And isn't this manual labour
rather like that of the tent-maker SAUL, whose other name was PAUL?
Might it not do a bishop or two, or even an archbishop, some good
were he to tuck up his lawn sleeves and a corner of his apron just
to take a turn at digging and delving? Perhaps, on the score of
practical Christianity, it would be well if these hard-working
Assyrian Christians sent a few missionaries over to our comfortable
Christians here.

I HATE a passion to be told
(Amounting almost to a thirst),
What constitutes a dam in gold,
And when the thing is bound to burst;
And could you tell us, Mr. CRUMP,
Why silver undergoes a slump?
That metaphor of " dam," it seems,
Is drawn from rolling logs that hug
Each other in Norwegian streams,
And cause a temporary plug,
Until, I gather, Mr. CRUMP,
They ultimately come down plump.
What all the glut of oof should buy
You say surpasses human wit;
Strangely enough I feel that I
Could show you what to do with it;
Speaking for paupers, Mr. CRFMP,
I rather like it in the lump.
Bat soon there '11 be a blessed spate,
The dam will give, I understand,
And Little Chatbams turn to Great,
And Trunks Preferred be really Grand,
And low investments, Mr. CRUMP,
Go smartly on the upward stump.

Of those effects in which my mother

To render rugged places level;
Some call the same a sheer abysm,

The sickly camel gets the hump.

A fiscal flutter, when I saw it,

No power of man or beast should draw it;
Neither wild horses, Mr. CRUMP,
Nor any earthly stomach-pump.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
"AFTER reading W. S. LILLY'S latest and really most admirable
book, entitled The Claims of Christianity," quoth the Baron, "I
feel inclined to exclaim with the Cantab wno had been compelled to
attend a course of University sermons, ' Thank Heaven. I am still a
Christian!'" The tirst part is about Buddhism, which came into
the world 700 B.C., and at this present moment, so the Baron gathers,
not only counts more adherents than would all Christendom even if
united, but is absolutely spreading faster than Christianity is now
doing, or has done, for some time past. So at the end of this first
part, the Baron, elevating his thoughts and his eyes, exclaimed, "I
will be engrafted on the Buddha! I will be Buddha'd out with the
Lilly I I will flit from flower to flower! and up to regions of Floral
Halls above! I'll be a Buddha-fly!" Coming down from these
flights of pious fancy, the Buddha-Baron commenced Part the Second
of the same work. It was, as it were, a Turkish Bath. The Baron,
no longer the "Buddha-Baron," but the "Bechesm-on-my-eyes-
be-it Baron," called for a fez, renounced his toddy—was not the glass
well-nigh void ?—sent out for a sixpenny bottle of the best sherbert,
and was considering the advisability of immediately consulting the
Baroness as to giving a general order for a Harem at the Stores
of some Universal Provider, when, on resuming his study, and after
finishing the third part, which concludes this work with a convincing
summary of the superiority of Christianity over any other form of
religion, he counter-ordered the fez, kept silence on the Harem
subject, gave the sherbert. to the youngest Baronite, aged seven, and,
after a pipe and one more toddy, the Baron murmured " Christianas
gum non CEdipus," Then melodiously whistling " Lilly Bolero" he
ascended the Baronial stairs to seek, beneath his virtuous eider-downy,
"That calm repose
Which innocence and virtue only knows."
But before doing so he uttered the quotation which heads this brief
notice. "I have a multitude of books to read, and but scant time to
look into them till the vacation arrive! But, ah me!'' sighed the
Baron, " is there any vacation for this ever-toiling, never complaining,

matchmakers you women are! You 're never happy, any of you, till
yon 've taken a poor devil of a chap away from all his little games,
and all his little comforts, and got him safely started in the Peram-
bulator Stakes. It's all very well to talk, but the more I see of the
world, the more I 'm convinced that men were never meant to marry.
That's a game that may suit women, but it don't suit us. Where's
the catch of it P You say I want money; that's right enough, but
I 'd rather go on as I am than take £10,000 a year with the sort of
penalty that you generally find buckled on to it. A girl's all light
as long as she's a girl; but it don't last long, that's were the pinch
comes, and some of 'em turn into frumps, and others nag the life
out of a chap, and then there's what they call the care of a family—
all the blessed little olive-branches opening their beaks, and wanting
to be fed (that don't sound right somehow, but you know what
I mran). If you can pick me out the dead spit of yourself, I '11
marry her to-morrow; but you know as well as I do that there's
only one DODDLES in the world. TOM 's a lucky beggar, and
There, I'm getting quite sentimental, so I'll drop that tack. Any-
how, the American widow is off. I oan't do it, and there's an end
of it. She introduced me to her blessed father—"Popper" she
ci lied him—and the old man finished me.
I 'm writing to BEKKELEY to ask him and LUCY B. to dine at the
"Plato" on Thursday, so we can put off all discussion till we see
how that evening pans out. Bless you, DODDLES, you're a good sort.
Awfully glad to hear you 're going to the WlLLoroHBYs' "Divorce
Supper." I 'm to be there. What a game it is. MABEL KILLIGREW
and ALICE KENDALL are going, and I near TOTTIE MONTRESSOR and
ALMA KICKSEY are asked. I wonder if TOTTIE will do her wig-dance.
She took off ABQENTINO'S curly, brown head-covering as neat as nine-
pence last time she did it. Never saw anyone so angry as that old
gold-mine was. DICK TALBOYS is terrible gone in that quarter they
say, which is a pity, because he's a real good chap. Ait revoir on
Thursday. Bemember mo to Ton. Yours to a cinder,
JACK.
GERMAN OPERA AND MB. J. L. TOOLE.—Our eminent Comedian
wishes it to be distinctly understood that he has not entered into any
engagement with Sir DRUKioLANrs to appear at his theatre in Die
Walkure, which Mr. J. L. TOOLE here takes this German-opera-
tunity of stating is not an adaptation or translation of Walker—
London. Mr. J. L. TOOLE begs to add that his season concludes
next Saturday, when The Best Man (now in London) will go out of
town for " betterment," in older to return better than ever.
