'You well know what my pen can do, j I ride, and write, and skttch, and print, I I prose it here, I verse it there,

"Marvellous man !" cried Dr. SYNTAX, lifting his eyebrows until they almost met the downward curve of his tilted wig.
"TOBY," cried Mr. PUNCH, " call for clean pipes, a roll of the best Virginia, a dish of coffee, wax candles, and the
Supplement (otherwise my Christmas Number). Tell them, TOBIAS, to follow with a bowl of steaming punch—my own par-
ticular merum nectar—and Sir ROGER shall see what I have forgotten of his story, his tastes, and the duties of Amphitryon!"
In two minutes the Illustrious Trio were "making the centuries meet" under the benignly blending influences of
Good Tobacco, Sound Tipple, and Cheery Talk.
"And how fares ' Our Village ' (to quote Miss MITFORD) in these revolutionary days?" queried Dr. SYNTAX.
Mr. PUNCH smiled, and promptly quoted :—
"' And liquor that was brew'd at home

"Exactly so," cried the pursuer of the picturesque, profoundly flattered by Mr. PUNCH'S prodigious memory.
"Aye, prithee, Mr. PUNCH," said the old Knight, seriously, "tell us what means all this new-fangled nonsense of
Parish Meetings, Village Councils, Hodge pitchforked into power, and Squire and Parson out of it, and I know not what

"It means, my dear Knight," replied Mr. PUNCH pleasantly, "that power and responsibility, otherwise the Village

"Humph !" groaned the Knight, " too well, too well!
'A judge erected from a country clown'
might do well enough in poetry, but may mean ruin in practice. My misguided and stubborn friend, Sir ANDREW
FREEPORT, should have lived to see this day, and acknowledge the prescience of the testy old Tory he was wont to deride."
"Tilly-vally, my dear Sir ROGER," returned the host, cheerily; "trouble not thine honest soul with such gruesome
forebodings. 'The old order changeth, yieldeth place to new.' But 'tis 'lest one good custom should corrupt the world.'
CYMON, with a vote, will not capsize the Commonwealth, any more than the British workman hath done, despite the
prognostications of BOB LOWE and other cocksure clever ones. I '11 see that the ' Good Old Times' are not banished, save to
give place to Better New Ones! The New Village, Dr. SYNTAX, may not be quite as picturesque—in the old artistically
dilapidated, damp, dirty, disease-gendering sense—as the old one. As you yourself said—
'Though 'twill to hunger give relief,
There 'B nothing picturesque in beef."
No, nor are cleanliness, sanitation, education, fair wage, an independent spirit, and the capacity for self-government. These
things, dear Doctor, make the Man, not the Picture, and Man-making is—or should be—the aim of modern statesmanship."
"Mr. PUNCH," said Sir ROGER DE COVERLET earnestly, " my only wish is that Merry England, in going in for the
New Politics may not lose the old humanities and humours and heartinesses."
"As described, Sir ROGER, in your own words, of which your presence and the festive season, remind me:
'I have often thought that it happens very well that Christmas should fall out in the middle of winter. It is the most dead, un-
comfortable time of the year, when the poor people would suffer very much from their poverty and cold, if they had not good cheer, warm
fires, and Christmas gambols to support them. I love to rejoice their poor hearts at this season, and to see the whole village merry in my
great hall. I allow a double quantity of malt to my small beer, and set it a-running for twelve days to everyone that calls for it.'"
(The Spectator, No. 131, Tuesday, July 31, 1711.)
"Trust me, gentlemen," continued Mr. PUNCH, "all that was really good—like this—in the Good Old Times you
know can be preserved in the Better New Times we hope for. There will be plenty of work for the Sir ROGERS, the
Dr. SYNTAXES, for your humane Vicar, Doctor, and your Squire HEARTY and Squire BOUNTY, in the New Village as in the old
one. We love the old country customs, but our country dance cannot for ever be to the same old tune—even the loved and
time-honoured one of ' Sir Roger de Coverley '!"
"Sir," said the good old Knight, gladly, "you are doubtless right—as you always are—and I shall return to the
Shades greatly solaced both by your good cheer and your good counsel!"
"Sorry to lose your company so soon !" cried the Fleet Street Amphitryon. "I perceive, Dr. SYNTAX, that your old
grey mare, Grizzle, awaits you at the door. 'Vale! 0 Vale!' You ride pillion-wise, Sir ROGER, I suppose. Well, to
cheer your journey, brighten the Shades, and reassure ye both as to the safety of the New Village under the guidance of the
Old Counsellor, take with ye my

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

MR. PUNCH AT WHITE LODGE, RICHMOND.
"DON'T MAKE A NOISE, OR ELSE YOU "LL WAKE THE BABY
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
ABOUT the reminiscences of GEORGE AUGUSTUS SALA there lingers
a before-the-Flood flavour which abashes my Baronite. In Things
I hare Seen, and People I have Knoirn, two volumes, published by
CASSELL, there is nothing merely modern. The only thing 0. A. S.
doesn't appear to have seen was the world in the state of chaos, and
almost solitary among the people he has not known was METHU-
SELAH. That is an illusion due to the art of the writer, for, as a
matter of fact, his recollections commence in the year 1839, when he
was a boy at school in Paris, snubbed, fillipped, tweaked, punched,
and otherwise maltreated, by way of avenging Waterloo in his
person, and redressing the petty injuries inflicted upon NAPOLEON at
St. Helena by Sir HUDSON LOWE. Mr. SALA has not only lived long,
but, like ULYSSES, has travelled much, and has had singular good
fortune in being around when things were stirring. Thus, for
example, in the year 1840, as he happened to be strolling down the
Rue de la Paix, he saw a carriage draw up at a jeweller's shop,
escorted by a troop of shining cuirassiers. In it were two handsomely-
dressed ladies, "in cottage bonnets, with side-ringlets." There \yas
also a Norman peasant-woman, and in her lap reposed a great! v glorilied
babv. One of the ladies was the Duchease D'ORLEATJS, Consort of
the Heir Apparent, and the bundle of pink flesh was the Comte de
PAEIS, who seemed at the time to have nothing to do but to grow up
to man's estate, and take his place among the kings of France.
Sixteen years later, in the Rue de Rivoli, Mr. SALA saw another
carriage; more glittering cuirassiers; another little pink face;
again two little pudgy hands, and a surrounding wave of lace. Baby
number two was the Prince Imperial, and the scenes cnlled from
the flowery field of the great journalist's memory mark two memor-
able epochs in French history. A mere list of the people Mr. SALA
has known, and the things he has seen, form of themselves an entic-
ing, even an exhilarating chapter. THACKERAY and DICKENS he
knew, and worked with, and he throws some fresh light on their
characters. Soldiers, actors, statesmen, kings, murderers, and
habitats of debtors' prisons, have all come under his observation,
and live again in his pages. He is careful to make it clear that this
is not his autobiography. On that he is still engaged. This work,
presented as a sort of hors d'oeuvre, effectually serves to whet the
appetite, and makes the world hope he will hurry up with the
remaining dishes in the rare feast. "So says my Baronite, and the
Court is with him."
In reply to a question, which is "not a conundrum," at least
so says an Inquirer, as to "why the Baron spells ' sherbet' with two
'rV instead of only one," the Baron would remind his interlocutor
that, firstly, "genius is above all rules"; that, secondly, the Baron
would rather err with two " r's" than have anything to dp with a
"bet" when it can possibly be avoided; thirdly, that beinff of a
generous disposition, in this hot weather he loves prodigality in
liquids; not ashamed of avowal. Finally, he states that he uncon-
ditionally withdraws the "r" in the second syllable of "sherbert,"
because in "sherftei" there is no 'ert to anyone. So here's to his
eminent Inquirer's jolly good health, says
THE" BOUNTIFUL B. DE B.-W.
NOBLESSE OBLIGE.
ONE of the most pleasing incidents at the opening of the Tower
Bridge was the introduction by the LORD CHAMBERLAIN of the
Recorder of London to H.R.H. the Prince of WALES. "Our Own
Special" was not sufficiently near to hear the dialogue that passed
between them, but he has reasons for believing that Lord CABBJNOTON
observed to H.R.H., "Sir, I have the honour to present to your notice
Sir CHARLES HALL." Not to be outdone in courtesy, the Recorder
immediately added, "And I, Sir, am delighted to make known to
vour Royal Highness Lord CARRINGTON." Then returned the
Prince, with his customary gracious kindliness, "I am rejoiced
to meet two officials of so much distinction; but, do you know,
—I fancy we have met before! Indeed I am certain that the
excellent make-up of Sir CHARLES' wig and the easy carriage of
the LORD CHAMBERLAIN could only have been acquired oy long prac-
tice on the boards of the Cambridge A.D.C. I congratulate you my
Lord, and you Mr. Recorder upon the excellent use to which you have
put the educational advantages that you and I have derived from
our common Alma Mater." At this point the Tower guns began to
be fired, and consequently the remainder of the conversation was lost
in the reverberations of heavy artillery.

PART I.—SHADOWS CAST BEFORE.
SCENE I. — SIR RUPERT CULVERIN'S Study at Wyvern Court. It
it a rainy Saturday morning in February. Sir RrpEBT is at his
writing-table, at Lady CULVERTS enters tcith a deprecatory air.
Lady Culverin. So here you are, RUPEET! Not very busy, are
you? I won't keep you a moment. (She goes to a windoic.) Such a
nuisance it'a turning out so wet with all these people in the house,
isn't it?
Sir Rupert. "Well, I was thinking that, as there's nothing doing
out of doors, I might get a chance to knock off some of these con-
founded accounts, but—(resignedly)—if you think I ought to go and
look after
Lady Cult: No, no, the men are playing billiards, and the women
are in the Morning Room—they "re all right. I only wanted to ask
vou about to-night. You know the LULI.INOTOXS and the dear
Bishop and Mrs. RODNEY, and
one or two other people, are
coming to dinner? Well, who
ought to take in ROHESIA?
Sir Hup. (in dismay). RO-
HESIA! No idea she was coming
down this week!
Lady Culr. Yes, by the 4.45.
"With dear MAISIE. Surely you
knew that?
Sir Rup. In a sort of way;
didn't realise it was so near,
that's all.
Lady Cult. It's some time
since we had her last. And she
wanted to come. I didn't think
you would like me to write and
put her off.
Sir Rup. Put her offP Of
course I shpuldn 't, ALBINIA.
If my only sister isn't welcome
at Wyvern at any time—I say,
at any time—where the deuce
is she welcome?
Lady Culv. I don't know,
dear RUPEBT. But—but about
the table?
Sir Rup. So long as you don't
put her near me—that's all 7
care about.
Lady Culv. I mean—ought I
to send her in with Lord LUL-
LINGTON, or the Bishop?
Sir Rup. Why not let 'em
toss up P Loser gets her, of
course.
Lady Culv. RUPXRT! As if
I could suggest such a thing to
the Bishop! I suppose she 'd
better go in with Lord LUL-
LLNGTON—he's Lord Lieutenant
—and then it won't matter if
she does advocate Disestablish-
i
ment. Oh. but I forgot; she
thinks the House of Lords ought to be abolished too!
Sir Rup. Whoever takes ROHESIA in is likely to have a time of it.
Talked poor CANTIRE into his tomb a good ten years before he was
due there. Always lecturing, and domineering, and laying down
the law, as long as / can remember her. Can't stand ROHESIA—
never could!
Lady Cult: I don't think you ought to say so. really, RUPEHT.
And I m sure / get on very well with her—generally.
Sir Rup. Because you knock under to her.
Lady Cuh: I 'm sure I don't, RUPERT—at least, no more than
everybody else. Dear ROHESIA is so strong-minded and advanced and
all that, she takes such an interest in afl the new movements and
things, that she can't understand contradiction; she is so democratic
in her ideas, don't you know.
Sir Rup. Didn't prevent her marrying CANTIBI. And a demo-
cratic Countess—it's downright unnatural!
Lady Cuh: She believes it's her duty to set an example and meet
the People half way. That reminds me—did I tell you Mr. CLARION
BLAIK is coming down this evening, too?—only till Monday,
RUPEBT.
Sir Rup. CLARION BLAIR! nev«r heard of him.
Lady Cuh. I suppose I forgot. CLARION BLAIR isn't his real
Sir Rup. Don't see what any fellow wants with an alias. What is
his real name?
Lady Cult: Well, I know it was something ending in "ell," but
I mislaid his letter. Still, CLARION BLAER is the name he writes
under; he's a poet, RUPERT, and quite celebrated, so I 'm told.
Sir Rup. (uneasily). A poet! What on earth possessed you to ask
a literary fellow down here? Poetry isn't much in our way; and a
poet will be. confoundedly!
Lady Culv. I really couldn't help it, RUPEBT. ROHESIA insisted
on my naving him to meet her. She likes meeting clever and in-
teresting people. And this Mr. BLAIR, it seems, has just written a
volume of verses which are finer than anything that's been done
since—well, for ages!
Sir Run. What sort of verses?
Lady Culv. Well, they 're charmingly bound. I 've got the book
in the house, somewhere. ROHKSIA told me to send for it; but I
haven't had time to read it yet.
Sir Rup. Shouldn't be surprised if ROHESIA hadn't, either.
Lady Cuh: At all events, she's heard it talked about. The young
man's verses have made quite a
sensation; they 're so dreadfully
clever, and revolutionary, and
morbid and pessimistic, and all
that, so she made me promise to
ask him down here to meet her!
Sir Rup. Devilish thoughtful
of her.
Lady Cuh. Wasn't it? She
thought it might be a valuable
experience for him; he's sprung,
I believe, from quite the middle
class.
Sir Rup. Don't see myself
why should he be sprung on us.
Why can't ROHESIA ask him to
her own place?
Lady Cuh: I daresay she
will, if he turns out to be quite
presentable. And, of course, he
may, RUPERT, for anything we
can tell.
Sir Rup. Then you've never
seen him yourself! How did
you manage to ask him here,
then?
Lady Cuh: Oh, I wrote to
him through his publishers.
ROHESIA says that's the usual
way with literary persons one
doesn't happen to have met.
And he wrote to say he would
come.
Sir Rup. So we 're to have a
morbid revolutionary poet stay-
ing in the house, are we?
He '11 come down to dinner in a
flannel shirt and no tie—or else
a red one—if he don't bring
down a beastly bomb and try
to blow us all up! You '11 find
you 've made a mistake, AL-
BENIA, depend upon it.
Lady Culv. Dear RUPERT,

"What on earth possessed you to ask a literary fellow down here?"
aren't you just a little bit narrow? You forget that nowadays the
very best houses are proud to entertain Genius—no matter what their
opinions and appearance may be. And besides, we don't know what
changes may be coming. Surely it is wise and prudent to conciliate
the clever young men who might inflame the masses against us.
ROHESIA thinks so; she says it may be our only chance of stemming
the rising tide of Revolution, RUPERT!
Sir Rup. Oh, if ROHESIA thinks a revolution can be stemmed by
asking a few poets down from Saturday to Monday, she might do
her snare of the stemming at all events.
Lady Cuh: But you will be nice to him, RUPERT, won't you?
Sir 'Rup. I don't know that I 'm in the habit of being uncivil to
any guest of yours in this house, my dear, but I '11 be hanged if I
grorel to him, you know; the tide ain't as high as all that. But it's
an infernal nuisance, 'pon my word it is; you must look after him
yourself, I can't. I don't know what to talk to geniuses about; I 've
forgotten all the poetry I ever learnt. And if he comes out with any
of his Red Republican theories in my hearing, why
Lady Cuh: Oh, but he won't, dear. I'm certain he'll be quite
mild and inoffensive. Look at SHAKSPEARE—the bust, I mean—and

PuBvan! Doctors may talk, but—I 'ye been

down adiposity,
And preserve your liver from chill and shiver,
or growing a shrivelled callosity.
So I put on my hat—for I am getting fat!—
and I 've been for a walk—in the City.
The result of that walk P Well my mouth is
like chalk and my eyes feel all smarting
and gritty;
I "ve_got a sore throat from the matter afloat
in the air. It may sound like a fable,
But I'm game for betting that London is
getting one large and malodorous f table' 1
Dtar days of McADAM! If onli/ we had 'em,
with all disadvantages, back again!
Oh! to hear the rattle of well-shod cattle
upon the old granite-laid track again.
But this wooden pavement, e'en after lave-
ment is simple enslavement to nastiness,
For when it is dry 'tis foul dust in your eye,
and when moist mere malodorous pasti-
ness.
[)h, slip-sloppy Cabby, this Bouquet de Baby-
lon sniffs of ammonia horridly,
And stable-dust flying is terribly trying when
Phoebus is pouring down torriuly!

I 'm frantic with drouth, and the taste in my

The water-carts come; but they're only a
hum, for the sun and the wind dry it up
again,
And then on manure in a powder impure the
pedestrian's fated to sup again.
It's worse than a circus. If men from the
"Vorkus" were turned on to keen it well
swept up,
There might be improvement. But there's
no such movement; the dire thorax-
torture is kept up.
Manure-desiccation sets up irritation and
then inflammation will follow,
Your tonsils get red, you 've a pain in vour
head, and you tind it a labour to swallow.
And as to your nose!—well, I do not suppose
for that organ reformers feel pity,
Or I really can t think every species of stink
would find such ready home in the City.
There's nothing more foul than your grim

Valley of BUNYAS'S !—
And then manhole whiffs! Or nose-torturing
sniffs from the shops that sell " Sausage-

this Bouquet de Babylon bothers.
Surely pavements of wood cannot be very
good when they lead to such' stenches
and smothers.

And so ends my talk on alate evening walk, and
Which worries my nose, sets my thorax in
throes, my nostrils stuffs up, till I 'm like
a pug pup, all snorts, sniffs, and snuffles;
my temper it ruffles; gives me a choked
lung, and a coppery tongue, a stomach at
war, and a nasal catarrh; a cough and a
sneeze, and a gurgle and wheeze; a thirst
quite immense, and a general sense that
the bore is intense; and a perfect con-
viction, beyond contradiction, that till
the new brood paved our city with wood,
and its air made impure with dust-pow-
dered manure, I never was sure that at

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
GAIETY "SANS-GENE."
Madame Sans-Gene, represented by Madame REJANE, at the
Gaiety Theatre, has made a decided hit. The plot of the piece by
Messieurs SARDOU and MOREATT is poor, but it shows what an ex-
perienced dramatist can dp with meagre materials and one strikingly
(food notion. It seems as if the plan of the play was started from the
idea of an interview between the great NAPOLEON, when Emperor
with a washerwoman whose bill for washing and mending he, whe:
only a poor lieutenant, had been unable to discharge. Thia scene i
the scene par excellence of the piece. It is here that both Madam
REJANE and M. DCQCESNE are at their very best. Besides this
and the scene between Napoleon, La Heine Caroline, and Madam
He Bnloie, when there is a regular family row admirably acted b'
M. DUQET,SNE, with th
tongs, and Miles. VEKNETJT
and SUOER with their glil
tongues, there is very littl
in the piece.
M. CANDE, as the ser
geant who rises to Mare
chal, is very good, as i
also M. LERAND, as Fouchf
Madame REJANE is i
thorough comedienne, bu1
it is most unlikely (good as
are historically the stories
told about this same washer
woman elevated to the rank
of Duchess) that she, in an
interval of nineteen yeari
—i.e., between 1792 anc
1811—should not have been
able to wear her costume
with, at all events, some
grace and dignity, and it
is most improbable thai
the clever blanchisseuse oi
1792 should, in 1811, have
found any difficulty in
managing her Court cos-
tume without rendering
herself outrageously
ridiculous. All this hitch-
ing up of the dress and
kicking out of the leg
"goes immensely with
the audience; and this
must be the comedienne's
excuse for overdoing the
farcical business of her
chief scenes, save the best
of all, which, as I have
already surmised, was the
motive of the piece, name-
ly, the scene with the
Emperor in the Third Act.
Here she is perfect, only
just assuming so much of
her old manner as would
naturally come to her when chatting with " the little Corporal" over
old times.
As to M. DUQUESNE as Napoleon premier,—well, middle-aged play-
goers will call to mind Mr. BENJAMIN WEBSTEB as a far more perfect
portrait of the great Emperor than is M. DUQUESITE, but the latter
Etas the advantage in manner, and realises the Emperor's traditional
jccentric habits in a way which at once appeals to all conversant with
the story of the eccentricities of the Great Emperor when he chanced
to be in a very good humour. Perhaps nowadays there are very few
who read LEVER'S works, but a dip into Charles O'Malley, with
PHIZ'S spirited illustrations, will give exactly the phase of NAPO-
LEON'S character that Messrs. SAKDOU and MOEEAU have depicted
n this piece.
The play is well mounted, and the acting of all, from the leading
Mirts to tne very least, is about as good as it can be. The incidents
of the drama are not particularly novel, but they are safe, and to
every Act there is a good dramatic finish. Madame REJAJTE may
congratulate herself and " Co." on a decided success in London.

MRS. R. was driving lately in a friend's barouche, which seemed
o swing about a gtettt deal, and made her feel rather uncomfortable.
She was not surprised at this, however, when she heard the carriage

wunderfool Bridge, I was arsked to take a jurney to Boolong, which I
bleeves is in France, and back again in the same day! but I aint a
werry good Sailer so I thort I had better decline it. So BROWN went
in my place, and werry much he says he injoyed it, tho he didn't git
home till eleven o Clock at night!

the sea must have bin werry uncommon smooth, and both ways,

aoount for its treeting him so smoothly.
Most of the Gents of the London Press on their wisit to the Big
Bridge seemed to think most of the opening and shuttin of the
enormers shutters as they opened and shut all of their own acord
to let the big ships go thro, and werry wunderfool they suttenly
was, but to my poor mind, ewery body as reelly wants to see the
most butiful part of the hole show shoud have hisself took up in the
lift to the walk along the top, which is only about 210 feet high, and
then he can have such a grand view of our butiful river Terns as
werry few has ewer had since it was fust made. One of the Press
[Jents, seeing' me staring at it with wunder and admiration, came up
to me and sed, "Why, Mr. ROBERT, you've most suttenly picked
out the most lovely view of the lot. I don't know what enormus
distance we can see, but if you looks just where I 'm a pinting you
will see the Kristel Pallia, and it don't look more than a mile or two
away!" No more it did! And as for the crowds of ships as we
ooud see with our naked eyes, I schod have thort they was more than
iwer entered the River in a month or two, and all round was the
nit i ful hills and grand houses, and everythink looking chock full of
jussel and prosperity, and all quite reddy to make use of the butiful

not be persevered in. SAUNDERSON perceiving; his mistake acquiesced,
and DON'T KEIR HARDIE went on to final ignominious collapse. When
in crowded House question put that Address be presented, a solitary
cry of "No " answered the loud shout " Aye. House cleared for
division; but when opportunity of taking final step presented itself, it
turned out that HARDIE Didn't Keir to take it.
"Now if this were France in the days when the Empire was totter-
ing to its fall," said SAKK, "I should suspect the secret police to have
put up DON'T KKJK to play their game in stirring up embers of popu-
laritity of Imperial Family. In England to-day, of course, no neces-
sity for such manoeuvre. But if by outside influence the popularity
the Prince of WALES has worked out for himself could be increased,
DON'T KEIR HARDIE 's the man to do it."
The Four Busy (Budget) B's.
Eusinefs done.—Clause XVIII. added to Budget Bill.
Wednesday.—GBANDOLPH sails to-day in the track of COLUMBUS,
only going much farther. He will cross Continent and Pacific to
pay a morning call on the MIKADO; afterwards to India and Burma.
"I want," he says, with certain proud pathos, " to see the frontier
I extended, and Burma which I annexed.
You remember the old French song written about GRARDOLPH'S
great ancestor? It was sung as a lullaby to the little son of LOTJIS
THE SIXTEENTH, and NAPOLEON never mounted bis horse for the
fight without humming the air,—
MAKLBROOK e'en va-t'en guerre— Ne sais quand reviendra!
Hironton, mironton, mirontaine! Ne sais quand reviendra!
MAKLBROOK s'en va-t'en guerre... Ne aai» quand reviendra!
There is a sad last verse to the old ballad. But we all hope to see |
our GKANDOLPH back again, bringing his sheaves with him in the j
shape of renewed health and strength. Business done.—Budget.
Thursday.—DOX'T KEIR HARDIE canfided to House to-night the'
interesting fact that in particular he Don't Keir for the Royal
Family, and is "indisposed to associate himself" with effort to do
them special honour. Like old Eccles in Caste, he upbraids the
baby in the cradle with being a young aristocrat. Yet there are
limits even to his uncompromising Republicanism. The question
before House is the presentation to HER MAJESTY of address of con- |
gratulation on birth of son of Duke and Duchess of YORK. "If I
had the opportunity of meeting the parents," says DON'T KEIR, "I'
should be pleased to join in the ordinary congratulations of the
occasion." He did not hesitate, standing in his place in Parliament
as representative of the electors of 'Am. to add that he "had been
delighted to learn that the child was a fairly healthy one." Beyond
that, stern principle would not permit him to pass.
Note that he felt constrained to modify even this approval of pro-
ceedings at White Lodge by introduction of the word "fairly."
AsQUTTir, who knows all about it, seemed for moment inclined to
resent this aspersion on the perfect soundness of the object of his
recent attentions; on reflection he let it pass. SAUNDERSON, of
whom House has seen lamentably little of late, was under less com-
plete self-restraint. When DON'T KEIR turned his attention upon
Prince of WALKS, proposing to appraise his value to the nation,
SAUNDERSON leaped to his feet, and moved that "the hon. Member
be no longer heard."
A difficult moment this. The Motion being made, the SPEAKER
must put it from the Chair. Many Members, whilst justly angered
with DON'T KEIR'S grotesque performance, would have felt bound to
resent what might be construed as attempt to throttle free speech.
There would have been long and angry debate; a succession of
scenes; and DON'T KEIR HARDIE would have been triumphantly
advertised. Happily, though, strictly considered, irregularly, the

Scene from " Caste" adapted for representation in the House of Commons.
Eccles (played by Don't Keir H-rd-e) addresses the Royal Infant.
"Everybody in the House is sacrificed for you! And to think that a Work-
ing Man, a ^Member of the House of Commons, and one of the Committee of
the Banded Brothers for the Regeneration of Human Kind, by means of equal
diffusion of intelligence and equal division of property, should wunt the price
of half a pint, while you are lying in the lap of luxury!" ice., &c., &c.
Business done.—QUEEN congratulated on birth of latest great-
grandson.
Friday.—Been much struck through week by appearanceof stranger
in Speaker's Gallery. Every night about quarter of an hour after
questions over he has come in; gone out again a little after eight,
about time SPEAKER, when in chair, leaves for his chop. Comes back
punctually in half an hour; remains till fifteen or twenty minutes
before progress is reported, and Chairman of Committees makes way
for SPEAKER. Something about him familiar, though never before
that I remember have I seen that stubbly red beard, or those green,
goggly spectacles. Quite fascinated me. To-night went up and sat
in gallery behind him.
At ten minutes past eight, amendment before Committee disposed
of, the stranger rose; heard him exclaim under his breath, "Order!
Order!" saw him clutch at imaginary robe, and stride forth with
stately tread. Truth burst upon me with a flash.
It was the SPSAKKR!
"You're a dangerous person to have about the premises, TOBY," he
said as we made our way by circuitous route to Speaker's Court.
"Every day for last fortnight I have written out myself an order for
the Speaker's Callerv, have passed the doorkeepers unobserved, and
remained hour after hour unnoticed. Then your eagle eye falls upon
me and all is lost. Pray don't let the secret go any further. Fact is,
for weeks and weeks I 've been shut out of my proper place bv this
Budget Bill. Questions last half an hour or an hour. Then House
goes into Committee, and 1 'm shunted save for few moments after
midnight, when I adjourn the House. Couldn't stand it any longer.
Might as well be in Kamtchatka. So have had recourse to this in-
nocent device, and have thoroughly enjoyed my evenings."
Business done.—Once through Committee on Budget Bill. Pick
SQUIRE OF MALWOOD interposed; expressed hope that Motion would
up dropped threads next week.

STATE AID FOR MATRIMONY.
(By a University Eztensioniit.)
DEAH MB. PUNCH,—What a charming little
theatre that is at Burlington House I I missed
you at the malinfes there a few days ago. Of
course you know the Travelling Provincial
Company of the Universities' Guild for the
Extension of High-Class Comedv? Well,
they visited the Metropolis for their coming-
of-agc, and gave the new extravaganza of
Hodge, li.Sc., or The Vision of Peers and
the Plowman. This had nothing to do with
Jupiter. LL.T)., though no fewer than three
noble Chancellors took a leading part at the
different performance?. After all it was
nothing but a dished-up version of the old
plav ot Gentleman Geordie, or The Cultured
Collier: only the pitman business is a little
played out, and the victim of Agricultural
Enlightuient is just now the vogue, thanks to
the County Councils.
But what interest, you will say, ran this
weary work have for " the young person" (is
not that the phrase!'}. Why should KTBKL
and I and the other country cousins, who are
up to have a pood time, waste our precious
moments on University Extension, when they
might have been given to the galleries, or,
better still, to the shops? Dear Mr. Punch,
you will not betray my confidence and print
my real name, trill you, if I tell you the
rtason? I do so in the hope that you will
use your great and good influence to support
our claim for State aid in a matter deeply in-
teresting us girls in the provinces.
I have ahyays thought that the most
important object of University Extension
has been overlooked. It certainly was the
other day. I mean this. In the present
unparalleled depression of the matrimonial

market, what we want is a constant supply
of nice, eligible young men from the Univer-
sity "brought home to our very doors," as
they say about culture and the people. We
cannot all live in garrison towns, and what
are two or three curates among so many?
Alreadv, as I have seen in one of the maga-
zines for young ladies, the cleric cloth is
being supplanted in romantic fiction by the
lay lecturer's velveteen. But we must have
State said, and, if necesary, create a fresh
Government Department, for the increase
and support of this class of men. The pro-
fession would be very popular; those who
joined it would keep marrying and moving
on (I hope I express myself intelligently),
and there would soon be enough to go round.
ETHEL'S papa, who is not very rich, and has
a large family, told her that people in Rome
who married, and had three children, got a
sort of degree for it, and were let off taxes.
It seems to me that the scheme for State aid
which I suggest is a much more modest one.
A man that played the title-Kile in Iluilge,
B.tie., gave vent to what I considered a very
stupid sentiment. "Give us," he said,
"some really useful and sensible instruction,
not silly lectures about Love and Marriage,
just to make people laugh!" This only
shows how dreadfully void of finer feeling is
your man of Agricultural Enlightenment.
Why, we once had a delightful course on
almost the very subjects at which he was
ignprantly _pleased to scoff! It was given by
an interesting-looking young graduate from
St; Valentine's, and was called "Byron and
Shelley, with dissolving views." 1 remem-
ber well the questions set by him for one of
the weekly papers. Shall I repeat them':
He had just been lecturing on Don Juan.
1. Give in alphabetical order the chief at-
tractions of the Hero of our poem.
2. Cite parallels to Don Juan among the
gentleman friends of your acquaintance other
than Jixti-ntion Lecturers.
3. Contrast the character ;if any) of JfaiJee
with that of (</) The Maid </ Athens.
(6) Queen Mai).
I took a lot of pains over this paper, and I
sent the lecturer an anonymous buttoa-hole,
with a request (in the fame handwriting as
on the answer-paper) that he would wear my
floral tribute at lecture. Ho did so, and ex-
pressed himself as greatly pleased with my
work. On my exercise (which I have kept)
he wrote the following observation:—"Ex-
cellent; most appreciative and womanly; 1
thank you; should like to discuss a small
question with you after class."
Now we want more of this spirit among
Extension Lecturers. True, the one of whom
I spoke turned out afterwards to have been
married all the time, and I do think he should
have mentioned it on the cover of his syllabus;
but the principle holds good just the same.
So, dear Mr. Punch, on this question of
State aid, at which I have (as I hope with
delicacy) hinted above, you irilthdpus, won't
you V Your devoted, MADGE.
P.S.—Couldn't you lecture to us on some-
thing nice, and help to raise a fund for our
scheme?
YET ANOTHER MEMOIR OF NAPOLEON.
DEAR MB. PCXCH,—There are so -many.
lives of the great NAPOLEON being published •
nowadays that one might fancy the former
ruler of France must liave been as many-
1 careered as a cat. Still, it may be interesting'
to your readers if I give a few particulars of
the great man that have not yet appeared in
print, if I except the pages of your own im-
I mortal volumes.
I had the pleasure of meeting the great
NAPOLEON someforty or fifty yearsago; hewas
then in his prime.
In personal appearance he was not unlike
! the portraits so familiar to the public. In
1 spite of his enthusiastic devotion for France,
he invariably addressed his troops in the
| English language. This is a characteristic
i that seemingly has escaped the attention of
all his biographers.
The numbers and quality of his army have
been much exaggerated. Although in his
speeches he was accustomed to boast of the
strength of his troops, as a matter of fact
I they could be more easily counted by tens than
hundreds. His artillery was almost a myth,
and the ammunition was chiefly composed of
crackers. As for his cavalry, the hordes were
thowy but unreliable, many of them hud white
spots, and not a few were extremely intelli-
gent. His favourite charger had been known
on occasion (when engaged in circus duty) to
drink a glass of sherry with the clown.
i But there is one point I particularly wi4i
to set right. Although known by the public
asNAPOLEOX BroNAi'AHTE, my hero in private
life was invariably called by his intimates
"poor old GOJIERSAL."
Yours respect fully,
The Amphitheatre Bos\VELL llemvivrs.
Within Si/e i>f Astlcy't.
P.S.—I saw the latest actor's edition of
NAPOLEON the other night at the Gaiety. He
wasn't" in it" with " GOMEK«.\L,"—but then
i GoMEESALwasoccasionallyonhorseback; still,

Thursday.—DON'T KEIR HARDIE confided to House to-night the
interesting fact that in particular he Don't Keir for the Koyal
Family, and is "indisposed to associate himself" with effort to do
them special honour. Like old Eccles in Caste, he upbraids the
baby in the cradle with being a young aristocrat. Yet there are
limits even to his uncompromising Republicanism. The question
before House is the presentation to HER MAJESTY of address of con-
fratulation on birth of son of Duke and Duchess of YORK. "If I
ad the opportunity of meeting the parents," says DON'T KEIR, "I j
should be pleased to join in the ordinary congratulations of the
occasion." He did not hesitate, standing in his place in Parliament
as representative of the electors of 'Am, to add that he "had been
delighted to learn that the child was a fairly healthy one." Beyond
that, stern principle would not permit him to pass.
Note that he felt constrained to modify even this approval of pro- |
ceedings at White Lodge by introduction of the word "fairly."
ASQUTTII, who knows all about it, seemed for moment inclined to
resent this aspersion on the perfect soundness of the object of his
recent attentions; on reflection he let it pass. SAUNDERSON, of
whom House has seen lamentably little of late, was under less com-
plete self-restraint. When DON'T KEIR turned his attention upon
Prince of WALES, proposing to appraise his value to the nation,
SAUNDERSON leaped to his feet, and moved that " the hon. Member
be no longer heard."
A difficult moment this. The Motion being made, the SPEAKER
must put it from the Chair. Many Members, whilst justly angered
with DON'T KEIR'S grotesque performance, would have felt bound to
resent what might bo construed as attempt to throttle free speech.
There would have been long and angry debate; a succession of
scenes; and DON'T KEIR BARDIE would have been triumphantly
advertised. Happily, though, strictly considered, irregularly, the
Settle front " Caste," adapted fur representation in the Hunsr uf Commons.
Eccltf (played by Don't Keir H-rd-e) addresses the Soya! Infant.
"Everybody in the House is sacrificed for you! And to think that a Work-

diffusion of intelligence and equal division of property, should wunt the price

Business done.—QUEEN congratulated on birth of latest great-

before progress is reported, and Chairman of Committees makes way
for SPEAKER. Something about him familiar, though never before
that I remember have I seen that stubbly red beard, or those green,
goggly spectacles. Quite fascinated me. To-night went up and sat
in gallery behind him.
At ten minutes past eight, amendment before Committee disposed
of, the stranger rose; heard him exclaim under his breath. "Order!

stately tread. Truth burst upon me with a flash.
It was the SPZAKBR 1

To learn the new artistic tint
Adopted by Princesses,
To roam the galleries with her

STATE AID FOR MATRIMONY.
(By a University Extensionist.)
DEAB MB. PUNCH,—"What a charming little
theatre that is at Burlington House I I missed
you at the matinees there a few days ago. Of
course you know the Travelling Provincial
Company of the Universities' Guild for the
Extension of High-Class Comedy 'if Well,
they visited the Metropolis for their coming-
of-sge, and gave the new extravaganza of

the Plotcman. This had nothing to do with

noble Chancellors took a leading part at the
different performance?. After all it was
nothing but a dished-up version of the old
plav ot Gentleman Gcordie, or The Cultured
Collier; only the pitman business is a little
played out, and the victim of Agricultural
Eniightinent is just now the vogue, thanks to
the County Councils.
But what interest, you will say, can this
weary work have for " the young person" (is
not that the phrase'r). Why should KTBEI.
and I and the other country cousins, who are
up to have a good time, waste our precious
moments on University Extension, when they
might have been given to the galleries, or,
better still, to the shops? Dear Mr. I'unch,
you will not betray my confidence and print
my real name, irilf you, if I tell you the
reason? I do so in the hope that you will
use your great and good influence to support
our claim for State aid in a matter deeply in-
teresting us girls in the provinces.
I have always thought that the most
important object of University Extension
has been overlooked. It certainly was the
other day. I mean this. In the present
unparalleled depression of the matrimonial

market, what we want is a constant supply
of nice, eligible young men from the Univer-
sity "brought home to our very doors," as
they say about culture and the people. We
cannot all live in garrison towns, and what
are two or three curates among so many?
Alreadv, as I have seen in one of the maga-
zines for young ladies, the cleric cloth is
being supplanted in romantic fiction by the
lay lecturer's velveteen. But we must have
State said, and, if necesary, create a fresh
Government Department, for the increase
and support of this class of men. The pro-
fession would be very popular; those who
joined it would keep marrying and moving
on (I hope I express myself intelligently),
and there would soon be enough to go round.
ETHEL'S papa, who is not very rich, and has
a large family, told her that people in Rome
who married, and had three children, got a

COKAYNE, Mrs. BBOOKE-CHATTEBIS, and Miss VIVIEN SPEL-
WANE are comfortably established near the fireplace. The
Hon. BEBTIE PILLINER, Captain TIUCKNESSE, and ARCHIE

Miss Spelu-ane. Why, you don't mean to say you've torn your-
selves away from your beloved billiards already? Quite wonderful!
Bertie Ptiliner. It's too horrid of you to leave us to play all by

come and toboggan down the big
staircase on a tea-tray. Do! It's

Capt. Thick, (to himself). If there's
one thing I can't stand it 'a a rowdy
buUyraggin' ass like ABCHIE!
Lady Rhoda. Ta muchly, dear boy,
but you don't catch me travelliii'
downstairs on a tea-tray twice—it's
just a bitioo elinkin', don't you know!
Archie (disappointed). Why, there's
a mat at the bottom of the stairs!
Well, if you won't, let's get up a
cushion fight, then. BERTIE and I
will choose sides. PILLINEE, I '11 toss
you for first pick up — come out of
that, do.
Bertie (lazily). Thanks, I'm much
too comfy where I am. And I don't
see any point in romping and rump-
ling one's hair just betore lunch.
Archie. Weil, you are slack. And
there's a good hour still before lunch.
THICKNESHK, you suggest something,
there's a dear old chap.
Capt. Thick, (after a mental eff'ort).
Suppose we all go and have another
look round at the gees—eh, what?
Bertie. I beg to oppose. Do let's
show tome respect for the privacv of
the British hunter. Why should 1 go
and smack them on their fat backs,
and feel every one of their horrid legs
twice in one morning? I shouldn't
like a horse coming into my bedroom
at all hours to smack me on the back.
I should hale it!
Mrs. Brooke- Chatteris. I love them
—dear things! But still, it's so wet,
and it would mean going up and
changing our shoes too—perhaps Lady

clines to stir before lunch.

a little mud. (He saunters up to Miss SPELWANE and absently
jtulls the ear of a Japanese spaniel on her knee.) Poo', little fellow,
then!
Miss Spelw, Poor little fellow? On My lap!!!
Capt. Thick. Oh, it—ah—didn't occur to me that he was on your
lap. He don't seem to mind that.
Miss Spelw. No? How forbearing of him! Would you mind not
standing quite so much in my light, I can't see my work.
Cant.' Thick, (to himself, retreating). That girl's always fishin'for

afternoon.

Bertie. Dear Lady RHODA, how cruel of you! You'll have to let
me stay. I '11 be sojrood. Look here, I '11 read aloud to you. I can
"My Love has sicklied unto Loath,
And foul seems all that fair I fancied—
The lily's sheen a leprous growth,
The very buttercups are rancid!"
Archie. Jove! The Johnny who wrote that must have been feelin'
chippy!
Bertie. He gets cheaper than that in the next poem. This is his
idea of " Abasement." [He reads.
"With matted head a-dabble in the dust,
And eyes tear-sealed in a saline crust,
I lie all loathly in my rags and rust—
Yet learn that strange delight may lurk in self-disgust."
Now, do you know, I rather like that
—it's so very decadent!
Lady Rhoda. I should call it utter
rot, myself.
Bertie (blandly). Forgive me, Lady
RHODA. "Utterly rotten," if you
like, but not "utter rot." There's a
difference, really. Now, I '11 read you
a quaint little production which lias
dropped down to the bottom of the
page, in low spirits, I suppose. "Stanza
written in Depression near Dulwich."
[He reads.
"The lark soars up in the air; The
toad sits tight in his hole;
And I would I were certain which of
the pair Were the truer type of
my soul!"
Archie. I should be inclined to back
the toad, myself.
Miss Spelw. If you must read, do
choose something a little less dismal.
Aren't there any love songs?
Bertie. I '11 look. Yes, any amount
—here's one. (He reads), "To My
Lady."
"Twine, lanken fingers lily-lithe,
Gleam, slanted eyes all beryl-
green, [awrithe,
Pout, blood-red lips that burst
Then—kiss me, Lady GBISOLINE!"
Miss Spelw. (interested). So that 's
his type. Does he mention whether
she did kiss him?
Bertie. Probably. Poets are always
privileged to kiss and tell. I '11 see ...
h'm, ha, yes; he does mention it ... I
think I '11 read something else. Here 'a
a classical specimen. [He reads.
"Uprears the monster now his slob-
berous head,
Its filamentous chaps her ankles
brushing;
Her twiee-five roseal toes are cramped in dread,
Each maidly instep mauven-pink is flushing."
And so on, don't you know. . . . Now I '11 read you a regular
rouser called "A Trumpet Blast." Sit tight, everybody! [7/e reads ^
"Pale Patricians, sunk in self-indulgence, (One for you, dear
ARCHIE !)
Blink your bleared eyes. (Blink, pretty creatures, blink!)
Behold the Snn-
-Burst proclaim, in purpuratc effulgence,
Demos dawning, and the Darkness- done!"
[General hilarity, amidst which Lady CuLVEBIX enters.
Lady Culcerin. So glad you all contrive to keep your spirits up, in
spite of this dismal weather. What is it that's amusing you all so
much, eh, dear VIVTEN?
Miss Speltf. BERTIE PILLINER has been reading aloud to us, dear
Lady CULVEBIN—the most ridiculous poetry—made us all simply
shriek. What's the name of it? (Taking the rolume out of
BERTIE'S hand.) Oh, Andromeda, and other poems. By CLABION

interested in the author, and as she and my niece MAISIE are coming

TO 1HE OXFORD CRICKET CAPTAIN.
"100, Not Out." Monday, July 2, 1894.
CONGRATULATIONS, Mr. C. B. FRY,
You neatly wiped the Cantab Light Blue eye,
And well deserved the fashionable shout
Which hailed you for your century, not out.
For your exploits, what language is too tall?
At cricket good alike with bat and ball,
Full back at football (that's Association),
At jumping lengthways—well, you lick creation.
In Schools no idler when stern duty calls,
Already having got a First in " Smalls."
Yes, Oxford surely boasts to-day in you,
Her most distinguished son, a Triple Blue.
The Lord's good wicket made a scoring high day,
But you yourself turned Monday into Fry-day!
ANARCHIST ATTEMPT ON A WELL-KNOWN BRIDGE.—After several
failures, the Hampton Court Bridge was shot yesterday evening by
a young man. supposed to be an Anarchist, whose name and address
remain a profound secret, as, owing to his having taken his outrigger
by the hour, and, having paid his shot, there was no excuse for his
detention by the assistants in charge of the boats. He had been
dining freely at a neighbouring hostelrie, (he sign of which being
"The Mitre," suggested to the intelligent detective in charge of the
case Ihe probability of the wretched youth being a " dine-a-mitre."
Furnished with this clue, the police are on his track. Fortunately
the bridge escaped without injury, and this morning it not only
crossed the river itself without difficulty, but assisted many travel-
lers to do the same.
ASPIRATION.—A youthful rhymist, inspired by the Derby, wishes
to become a Sporting Poet. "'Poet' ana ' Prophet,' " he learnedly
observes, "meant about the same thing in Homeric times; and,
indeed, in most prophecies of coming events on the turf I have
generally found more of poetry than of profit." The modest rhymster
says, that as he can never hope to be first in the field of poetry, "he
OPERATIC NOTES.
IT strikes me forcibly that the Wagnerian idea has influenced all
recent compositions. Nothing is now done without a " motive." It
may be a good motive, or a bad motive, or an inadequate motive, or
an indifferent motive; but motiye there must be with our most modern
school of composers, who, adopting the Wagnerian idea, (not in itself
a purely original one,) and improving on it, attribute less importance
to the "Act" than to the "motiye," though by a reflex action the
scheme of the Act suggests, organises, and it may be added, orches-
trates the " motives." L'Attaque du Moulin is a practical example
of this theory. It is
not styled an opera
but a lyric drama in
four acts. It is founded
by M. Louis GALLET
on ZOLA'S story; it is
reduced to plain English
by Mr. WEATHERLY;
the music is by ALFRED
BRUNEAU; and for the
stage management,
which has so largely
conduced to its success,
Sir AUGUSTUS DRURIO-
LANCS is responsible.
It is not what the
sporting papers term
"a merry mill," though
there is plenty of fight-
ing. There are some
songs in it, and there
are some melodies —
_ which

IH M M i- r*t~ \
'AttnqueJdu Moulin (afpoivro)
may'catch on when heard a second or third time; but they certainly
do not arrest the attention at a first hearing. The music, 1 judge
only from the one representation, seems lacking in those catching-on
airs which, coupled with the admirable acting of the principals,
made the fortune, stir le champ, of the Caralleria Riistlcana. But
a " wind-mill" without any " air" can't be expected to "go."
Madame DELNA is forcibly dramatic, true, but not powerful as a
singer, at least in Covent Garden. Nor is therein the character of this
Maid of the Mill any such great opportunity whereby to test the power
of the actress as there is in the part of Santitzza, or of Anita^
in La H'arurraise. Madame DELNA may be all that enthusiastic re-
porters have said she is, but she must have a great deal of power in
reserve, for the display of which this opera does not offer the chance.
Mons. BotrvET as Merlier, the Miller, who " created " the part in Paris,
is good, but his acting is somewhat monotonous. Madame DE Nuo-
VINA as Fran^oise, is a young Lady Macbeth, who gives the dagger
and does not request that it may be returned to her again when done
with. M. BONNABD, as the Singinif Sentinel, reminding me of
GILBERT and SULLIVAN'S Sentinel 'with a song " in one of the Savoy
Series, was very good; and Mons. COSSIHA, excellent as the escaping
prisoner, bore so strong a resemblance to the Director of the Fortunes
of Covent Garden and Drury Lane, that people looked twice at their
programmes in order to be quite sure that an apology for the singer
had not been made, and that the much-talented Sir DHURIOL ANUS had
not, at the shortest possible notice, consented to be his "remplacant."
Mons. ALBERS, as the German Captain, ought to be in receipt of a
very large salary, seeing "how wide he opens his mouth" when
singing. All were good in the best of all possible operatic entertain-
ments, including the unequalled orchestra conducted by M. PH.
FLON, (is this " Phlon-FLON"?) who has taken his turn with Signori
BEVIONANI, MANCINELLI, and Mr. FREDERIC COWEN, the last-
mentioned coming to look after his new Opera of Signa, in which
Madame DE NUOVINA was charming, and Signer BENJAMINO DAVIESO
appeared as the Anglo- Italian Tenor. Congratulations to Signer
FREDERICO COWENI.
Saturday night. Elaine. "If it 's not very lively," observes Sir
AUGUSTUS beforehand, "still it must be remembered that 1 have
not only at heart the interests— and in pocket the interest— of Covent
Garden, but also of ' Drear Elaine.' Should it prove a joyous opera
and attract the people, then I shall consider it as an example of
'Drawer- laine' at Covent Garden. But now — hark! — let us not
trifle with time and tune. MANCINELLI is raising his baton, up goes
the curtain, and all in to begin. Now verrons." And the "all"
includes the Prince and Princess of WALES and their two unmarried
daughters, and a very good house indeed. "And how is Elaine f"
is the question. "Very well, thank vqu, and much better than she
was two years ago," is the reply. Elaine is decidedly thinner. One
Act gone, and other judicious cuts have reduced her. The opera is
consequently lighter. Due weight, however, is given to it bv
Madame MELBA and JEAN DE RESZKE. DRUHIOLANUS has followed
the precedent of " cutting the "osses." But the " cackle" of geese
may at least become a second Ossy-'un,"
1 followeth not. On the contrary, the applause is abundant.

TO THE OXFORD CRICKET CAPTAIN.
"100, Not Out." Monday, July 2, 1894.
CONGRATULATIONS, Mr. C. B. FRY,
You neatly wiped the Cantab Light Blue eye,
And well deserved the fashionable shout
Which hailed you for your century, not out.
For your exploits, what language is too tall?
At cricket good alike with bat and ball,
Full back at football (that's Association),
At jumping lengthways—well, you lick creation.
In Schools no idler when stern duty calls,
Already having got a First in " Smalls."
Yes, Oxford surely boasts to-day in you,
Her most distinguished son, a Triple Blue.
The Lord's good wicket made a scoring high day,
But you yourself turned Monday into Fry-day!
ANARCHIST ATTEMI'T ON A WELL-KNOWN BRIDGE.—After several
failures, the Hampton Court Bridge was shot yesterday evening by
a young man, supposed to be an Anarchist, whose name and address
remain a profound secret, as( owing to his having taken his outrigger
by the hour, and, having paid his shot, there was no excuse for his
detention by the assistants in charge of the boats. He had been
dining freely at a neighbouring hostelrie, the sign of which being
"The Mitre," suggested to the intelligent detective in charge of the
case the probability of the wretched youth being a " dine-a-mitre."
Furnished with this clue, the police are on his track. Fortunately
the bridge escaped without injury, and this morning it not only
crossed the river itself without difficulty, but assisted many travel-
lers to do the same.
ASPIRATION.—A youthful rhymist, inspired by the Derby, wishes
to become a Sporting Poet. "' Poet' and ' Prophet,' " he learnedly
observes, "meant about the same thing in Homeric times; and,
indeed, in most prophecies of coming events on the turf I have
generally found more of poetry than of profit." The modest rhymster
eays, that as he can never hope to be first in the field of poetry, "he
OPERATIC NOTES.
IT strikes me forcibly that the Wagnerian idea hast influenced all
recent compositions. Nothing is now done without a "motive." It
may be a good motive, or a bad motive, or an inadequate motive, or
an indifferent motive; but motive there must be with our most modern
school of composers, who, adopting the Wagnerian idea, (not in itself
a purely original one,) and improving on it, attribute less importance
to the "Act" than to the "motive," though by a reflex action the
trates the " motives.'

,
scheme of the Act suggests, organises, and it may be added, orches-
3s." L Atiaque du Moulin is a practical example
of this theory. It is
not stvled an opera
but a lyric drama in
four acts. It is founded
by M. Louis GALLET
on ZOLA'S story; it is
reduced to plain English
by Mr. WEATHERLY;
the music is by ALFRED
BBUNEATT; and for the
stage management,
which has so largely
conduced to its success,
Sir AUGUSTUS DRURIO-
LANUS is responsible.
It is not what the
sporting papers term
"a merry mill," though
there is plenty of fight-
ing. There are some
songs in it, and there
,, .. ... — p- •.- are some melodies —
Moulin (ajpoivre) or miU_0(lics _ wMch
may^catch on when heard a second or third time; but they certainly
do not arrest the attention at a first hearing. The music, I judge
only from the one representation, seems lacking in those catching-on
airs which, coupled with the admirable acting of the principals,
made the fortune, snr le champ, of the Carallerin Riisticunu. But
a " wind-mill" without any " air" can't be expected to " go."
Madame DELNA is forcibly dramatic, true, but not powerful as a
singer, at least in Covent Garden. Nor is there in the character of this
Maid of the Mill any such great opportunity whereby to test the power
of the actress as there is in the part of Santuzza, or of Anita^
in La Xararraise. Madame DELNA may be all that enthusiastic re-
porters have said she is, but she must have a great deal of power in
reserve, for the display of which this opera does not otfer the chance.
Mons. BOUVET as Merlier, the Miller, who "created " the part in Paris,
is good, but his acting is somewhat monotonous. Madame DE Nuo-
VINA as Franqoise, is a young Lady Macbeth, who gives the dagger
and does not request that it may be returned to her again when done
with. M. BONNABD, as the Singing Sentinel, reminding me of
GILBERT and SULLIVAN'S Sentinel with a song " in one of the Savoy
Series, was very good; and Mons. COSSIRA, excellent as the escaping
prisoner, bore so strong a resemblance to the Director of the Fortunes
of Covent Garden and Drury Lane, that people looked twice at their
programmes in order to be quite sure that an ajxjlogy for the singer
had not been made, and that the much-talented Sir DBURiOLANUshad
not, at the shortest possible notice, consented to be his "remplaf nut."
Mons. ALBERS, as the German Captain, ought to be in receipt of a
very large salary, seeing "how wide he opens his month" when
singing. All were good in the best of all possible operatic entertain-
ments, including the unequalled orchestra conducted by M. PH.
FLON, (is this " Phlon-FLON1'?) who has taken his turn with Signori
BEVIGNANI, MANCINELLI, and Mr. FREDERIC COWEN, the last-
mentioned coming to look after his new Opera of Signa, in which
Madame DE Iv UOVINA was charming, and Signer BENJAMINO DAVIESO
appeared as the Anglo- Italian Tenor. Congratulations to Signor
FllEDERICO COWENI.
Saturday night. Elaine. "If it 's not very lively," observes Sir
AUGUSTUS beforehand, "still it must be remembered that 1 have
not only at heart the interests— and in pocket the interest— of Covent
Garden, but also of ' Drear Elaine.'1 Should it prove a joyous opera
and attract the people, then I shall consider it as an example of
'Drawer- laine' at Covent Garden. But now— hark !— let us not
trifle with time and time. MANCINELLI is raising his baton, up goes
the curtain, and all in to begin. Nous rerrons." And the "all"
includes the Prince and Princess of WALES and their two unmarried
daughters, and a very good house indeed. "And how is Elaine?"
is the question. "Very well, thank vou, and much better than she
was two years ago," is the reply. Efaine is decidedly thiuuer. One
Act gone, and other judicious cuts have reduced her. The opera is
consequently lighter. Due weight, however, is given to it bv
Madame ME'LBA and JEAN DE RESZKE. DRUBIOLANUS has followed
the precedent of " cutting the "osses." But the " cackle" of geese
may at least become a second Ossy-'un."
1 followeth not. On the contrary, the applause is abundant.

"A DELIGHTFUL book," quoth
the Baron, "is Dai-id Garrick,
written by my worthy friend,
JOSEPH KNIGHT, F.8.A. Let me
recommend this work as one to be
placed by your reading chair, and
to be taken up, as was Mrs.
Gamp's bottle, when so dispoged,
and oftentimes will you thus enjoy
a Knight with GARRICK." One
of the most humorous among very
many anecdotes in this book is
that about BOSWELL going to the
SHAKSPEABE Fete costumed as a
Corsican, within his pocket a poem
he had written for the occasion,
and "which," says Mr. KNISHT
simply, "he intended to speak,
but the crowd would not suspend
its diversions to hear him." That's
all: but isn't it delightful! Poor
BOZZT!!
The Baron is more than pleased
to see once again the deft hand of
Mr. T. H. S. ESCOTT at work in
reviews and magazines. Hispaper,
entitled " Edmund Yates, an Ap-
preciation and a Retrospect," is
most interesting to the Baron, who
can call to mind the persons he
mentions in literary and jour-
nalistic connection with EDMUND
YATES—though theBaron does not
happen to remember them in this

all of them younger by some years
than EDMCND YATES, who, at the
time HOOD, PROWSE, H. S. LEIGH

made his name in literature, was
CHARLES DICKEXS'S henchman,
and had been also more or less suc-
cessful, in combination with a Mr.

"all the world was young." The
World itself, of course, not having
been born or thought of. Looking
back to those days the Baron
thinks that Mr. ESCOTT does him-
self an iniustice, and that he is
younger than he thinks he is. Be
this as it may, he will in any case
have a stock of pleasant memories
to draw upon, and now, if his
health permit, all will look for-
ward to what he cannot look
forward to himself, i.e., his re-
miniscences. "Prosit.' Mr.

I regret, my Lord, that my young and

the Duke of HERNE BAY—misunderstood his
instructions.

however, that the inexperience of my noble

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

Smite of Commons, Monday, July 2.—" I am sorry," said Cap'en
TOMMY BOWLES, "that there is no CHATHAM, BURKE, or Fox alive
at this moment to resist this project of taxing the Colonies."
In their unavoidable absence the CAP'EN, contrary to his custom,
offered a few remarks. It had been just as well if he had omitted
the preliminary one. He really did not mean anything, much less
did he desire deliberately to offend his friends BARTLEY. BUTCHER,
and BYRNE. But, as the poet remarks, Evil is wrought by want of
thought, and the mvidiousness of TOMMY'S remark lost nothing of
sting because he hod not intended to hurt anyone's feelings—except,
of course, those of SQUIRE OF MALWOOD, and that is a legitimate
occupation. When an enthusiastic female admirer observed to the
eminent WHISTLER that he and VELASQUEZ were the two greatest
artists of times ancient or modern, JEMMY modestly observed, " Why
dragin VELASQUZZ?" Thus BARTLEY, BUTCHER, and BYBNEturned
upon TOMMY with reproachful glance and murmured, "Why drag
in CHATHAM, BURKE, and Fox?"
However, all over now. The midnight bells chiming over sultry
London proclaim passing of Budget Bill through Committee. Been
a long hard fight, monotonous in its continuity, occasionally exciting
in its divisions, continuously illustrative of Englishman's faculty of
never knowing when he's beaten. Honours rest with SQUIRE OF
M u.woo n who throughout has unflinchingly and, in the main, good
humouredly, borne the brunt of battle. The flesh is weak,
especially when there is a good deal of it, and the thermometer
stands at 82° in the shade. The SQUIRE has snapped occasionally,
JOEIM'S apologetic figure, upright at opposite side of table, proving
unfailing, irresistible, incentive. Even worse to bear have been the
dewrtion of a few followers and the importunity of many. Had the
SunKK been a weaker man, he would long ago have brought the
Closure to bear on obstruction, and there would have followed a
state of irritation, amid which, if Budget was not wrecked, it would
have appropriated the whole time of an extended Session. The
SQUIRE, going on another tack, has worn out obstruction by affecting
the virtue of urbanity if he had it not.
It was particularly hard lines, after getting Clause XXVII. through
last Wednesday with a majority of over half a hundred, to be com-
pelled to recommit Bill, in order that CLANCY might chortle, and
REDMOND rage. SQUIRE advised to resist; condemned from his own
to-night Bill recommitted in respect of this clause, and on stroke of
midnight the whole thing was done with.
"We Liberals," said the Member for SARK, "always know better
than pur leaders. As there are many of us, and as we each take our
individual view, result somewhat chaotic. Good thing if in com-
parative leisure of week end we think over how the Budget Bill was
passed, and what would have happened if we had worried the SQUIRE
into going one of our diverse ways."
business done.—Budget Bill.
Tuesday.—Enter the apothecary. It was Cap'en TOMMY BOWLES
who brought him on. The last person in any one's mind. House in
Committee on Army Estimates; HANBUHY to the fore. Bound to
live up to the 534 speeches he made and questions he put last year.
TOMMY then beat him by fourteen, and promises to be equally ahead
in the current Session. The CAP'EN hitherto had peculiar advantage,
seeing that for many weeks he has been, so to speak, cruising in
borne waters. Having been brought up on legacy tax, teethed on
death duties, TOMMY surprised himself and the House with the
command he displayed over intricacies of Budget Bill. HANBUEY
then fell behind. Now, with House in Committee on Army Estimates,
be can show TOMMY a clean pair of heels, a spectacle in which that
eminent and able Marine may or may not take keeu personal
interest.
HANBUBY began at once raising point of order; MELLOR ruled him
out like a shot; so went off on another tack. Adventured the
startlingly novel proposition that " promotion should be by merit."
Enlarged on the theme for twenty minutes; sat down only when he
concluded that audience had fully mastered^ the proposition, contem-
plation of which was new to their bewildered mind.
It was at this stage TOMMY towed in the apothecary. _He appeared
on the scene quite as abruptly as Romeo's acquaintance in the streets
of Mantua:—
I do remember an apothecary,
And hereabout he dwells.
CAP'EN omitted details; but House gathered that his friend the
apothecary was, like Romeo's, meagre of looks, worn to the bones by
sharp misery. This condition engendered by circumstance that he
had been brooding in his needy shop, among the green earthen pots,
bladders, and musty seeds, remnants of packthread and old cakes of
roses, upon fact that whilst there are surgeon-majors in the Army,
there are no apothecary-majors. On behalf of his absent friend,
TOMMY demanded an explanation from SECRETARY OF STATE FOR
WAE.
CA\VMELL-BANNEBMAN with the ruthless disregard of Shaksperian
traditions that seems to suit the War Office, said "apothecaries are
an expiring class," a wav of putting it that suggested they had been
dosing themselves. Their place was now filled by non-commissioned
officers, who were called compounders of medicine.
What a fall is here. Fancy Romeo going about the moonlit
streets of Mantua calling out, "What ho! Compounder of Medicine."
This callous remark had such effect on Cap'en TOMMY that he laid
aside his speaking-trumpet, and was heard no more through the live-
long night. ItimiiK'sa done.—Some Votes in Army Estimates.
Thursday.—Looked in after dinner just now; startled to find
HANBUEY on his legs, with bit of dirty white rag held out in
both hands towards Treasury Bench. Not many Members present;
those on Liberal side vociferously cheering. CAWMELL-BANNEEMAN
looking in better temper even than usual; which was strange since
Committee on Army Estimates been at it since four o'clock, and only
one vote passed. WOODALL, only other occupant of Treasury Bench,
been shewing how a man mav smile and smile, and be a Financial
Secretary to the War Office. Now the smile broadens till it stretches
almost full length of Treasury Bench. As SARK says, it justifies
RUDYARD KIPLING'S bold imagery of BOBS sitting on a bucking
charger,
With a smile round both yer ears,
Ain't ye Bobs?
CAUSTON just bustled in, holding telegram at arm's length. It is
the reading of this that has broken the monotony of Committee with
noise of cheering, and dashed a smile along the Ministerial benches
like a sudden flash of sunlight. Only for this merry mood, one
entering the House at thin particular moment might fear the worst.
HANBUEY been at it hour after hour since Tuesday, when House got
into Committee on Navy Estimates. CAWMELL-BANNERMAN, a
person of imperturbable temper. But there are limits to human
endurance; now they seem to have been reached. This telegram
CAUSTON has brought in and handed to War Minister doubtless
announces that all is ready: a file of soldiers waits on the Terrace;
HASBUBY will be seized, bound, carried forth, blindfolded, shot;
and then the Committee will really get to business, and vote Supply.
A sad fate for one only moderately middle-aged. Tu Fat voulu

The Baron is more than pleased
to see once again the deft hand of
Mr. T. H. S. ESCOTT at work in
reviews and magazines. Hispaper,
entitled " Edmund Yates, an Ap-
preciation and a Retrospect," is
most interesting to the Baron, who
can call to mind the persons he
mentions in literary and jour-
nalistic connection with EDMUND
YATES—though the Baron does not
hapoen to remember them in this
Particular connection, but as a
and of brothers quite apart, and
all of them younger by some years
than EDMUND YATES, who, at the
time HOOD, PBOWSE, H. S. LEIGH
and others were commencing, had
made his name in literature, was
CHABLES DICKENS'S henchman,
and had been also more or less suc-
cessful, in combination with a Mr.
HABBINGTON, as a dramatist. The
time I speak of is when H. J.

"all the world was young." The
World itself, of course, not having
been born or thought of. Looking
back to those days the Baron
thinks that Mr. ESCOTT does him-
self an iniustice, and that he is
younger than he thinks he is. Be
this as it may, he will in any case
have a stock of pleasant memories
to draw upon, and now, if his
health permit, all will look for-
ward to what he cannot look
forward to himself, i.e., his re-

MAY it please your Lordship, the Duke,
my learned and noble junior, will read the
pleadings.
I will leave it to mjr noble and learned friend
the Marquis to examine the next witness.
I can quite understand your Lordship's
annoyance, but I can assure you, my lord,
that the noble Earl from whom I receive my
instructions promised that the documents
should be forthcoming.
I suppose we may leave the question of
costs to be settled by our juniors the illustrious
Prince and the hereditary Earl Gardener?
Really, Duke, I must ask you not to inter-
rupt me while I am conducting this cross-
examination.
I regret, my Lord, that my young and
promising junior, who has but recently been
called to the Bar. should have made the
concession, but it is only right to tell your
Lordship that the nobleman in question—
the Duke of HERNE BAY—misunderstood his
instructions.
I am sorry, my Lord, that absence in
another part of the building prevented me
from addressing your Lordship. I trust,
however, that the inexperience of my noble
and learned friend, the Viscount TOTTEN-
HAM COURT ROAD, will not be allowed to
prejudice my client's interests.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

Home of Commons, Monday, July 2.—"I am sorry," said Cap'en
TOMMY BOWLES, "that there is no CHATHAM, BURKE, or Fox alive
at this moment to resist this project of taxing the Colonies."
In their unavoidable absence the CAP'S*, contrary to his custom,
offered a few remarks. It had been just as well if he had omitted
the preliminary one. He really did not mean anything, much less
did he desire deliberately to offend his friends BARTLEY, BUTCHER.
and 1! v UN K. But, as the poet remarks, Evil is wrought by want of
thought, and the invidiousness of TOMMY'S remark lost nothing of
sting because he had not intended to hurt anyone's feelings—except,
of course, those of SQUIRE OF MALWOOD, and that is a legitimate
occupation. When an enthusiastic female admirer observed to the
eminent WHISTLER that he and VELASQUEZ were the two greatest
artists of times ancient or modern, JEMMY modestly observed, " Why
dragin VELASQUEZ P" Thus BARTLEY, BUTCHER, and BYBXEturnea
upon TOMMY with reproachful glance and murmured, "Why drag
in CHATHAM, BURKE, and Fox'("
However, all over now. The midnight bells chiming over sultry
London proclaim passing of Budget Bill through Committee. Been
a long hard fight, monotonous in its continuity, occasionally exciting
in its divisions, continuously illustrative of Englishman's faculty of
never knowing when he's beaten. Honours rest with SQUIRE OF
MALWOOD. who throughout has unflinchingly and, in the main, good
humouredly, borne the brunt of battle. The flesh is weak,
especially when there is a good deal of it, and the thermometer
stands at 82° in the shade. The SQUIRE has snapped occasionally,
.IHKIM'S apologetic figure, upright at opposite side of table, proving
unfailing, irresistible, incentive. Even worse to bear have been the
dessrtion of a few followers and the importunity of many. Had the
SQUIRE been a weaker man, he would long ago have Drought the
Closure to bear on obstruction, and there would have followed a
state of irritation, amid which, if Budget was not wrecked, it would
have appropriated the whole time of an extended Session. The
SUUIRE, going on another tack, has worn out obstruction by affecting
the virtue of urbanity if he had it not.
It was particularly hard lines, after getting Clause XXVII. through
last Wednesday with a majority of over half a hundred, to be com-
pelled to recommit Bill, in order that CLANCY might chortle, and
REDMOND rage. SQUIRE advised to resist; condemned from his own
to-night Bill recommitted in respect of this clause, and on stroke of
midnight the whole thing was done with.
"We Liberals," said the Member for SAHK, "always know better
than pur leaders. As there are many of us, and as we each take our
individual view, result somewhat chaotic. Good thing if in com-
parative leisure of week end we think over how the Budget Bill was
passed, and what would have happened if we had worried the SQUIRE
into going one of our diverse ways."
Business done.—Budget Bill.
Tuesday.—Enter the apothecary. It was Cap'en TOMMY BOWLES
who brought him on. The last person in any one's mind. House in
Committee on Army Estimates; HANBORY to the fore. Bound to
live up to the 534 speeches he made and questions he put last year.
TOMMY then beat him by fourteen, and promises to be equally ahead
in the current Session. The CAP'EN hitherto had peculiar advantage,
seeing that for many weeks he has been, so to speak, cruising in
borne waters. Having been brought up on legacy tax, teethed on
death duties, TOMMY surprised himself and the House with the
command he displayed over intricacies of Budget Bill. HANBURY
then fell behind. Now, with House in Committee on Army Estimates,
be can show TOMMY a clean pair of heels, a spectacle in which that
eminent and able Marine may or may not take keen personal
interest.
HANBURY began at once raising point of order; MKLLOH ruled him
out like a shot; BO went off on another tack. Adventured the
startlingly novel proposition that " promotion should be by merit."
Enlarged on the theme for twenty minutes • sat down only when he
concluded that audience had fully mastered the proposition, contem-
plation of which was new to their bewildered mind.
It was at this stage TOMMY towed in the apothecary. He appeared
on the scene quite as abruptly as Romeo's acquaintance in the streets
of Mantua:—
I do remember an apothecary,
And hereabout he dwells.
CAP'EN omitted details; but House gathered that his friend the
apothecary was, like Romeo's, meagre of looks, worn to the bones by
sharp misery. This condition engendered by circumstance that he
had been brooding in his needy shop, among the green earthen pots,
bladders, and musty seeds, remnants of packthread and old cakes of
roses, upon fact that whilst there are surgeon-majors in the Army,
there are no apothecary-majors. On behalf of his absent friend,
TOMMY demanded an explanation from SECRETARY OF STATE FOR
WAR.
CAWMELL-BANNERMAN with the ruthless disregard of Shaksperian
traditions that seems to suit the War Office, said "apothecaries are
an expiring class," a wav of putting it that suggested they had been
dosing themselves. Their place was now filled by non-commissioned
officers, who were called compounders of medicine.
What a fall is here. Fancy Romeo going about the moonlit
streets of Mantua calling out. "What ho! Compounder of Medicine."
This callous remark had such effect on Cap'en TOMMY that he laid
aside his speaking-trumpet, and was heard no more through the live-
long night. Business done.—Some Votes in Army Estimates.
Thursday.—Looked in after dinner just now; startled to find
HAXBURY on his legs, with bit of dirty white rag held out in
both hands towards Treasury Bench. Not many Members present;
those on Liberal side vociferously cheering. CAWMELL-BANNERJIAN
looking in better temper even than usual; which was strange since
Committee on Army Estimates been at it since four o'clock, and only
one vote passed. WOODALL, only other occupant of Treasury Bench,
been shewing how a man mav smile and smile, and be a Financial
Secretary to the War Office. Now the smile broadens till it stretches
almost full length of Treasury Bench. As SARK says, it justifies
RUDTARD KIPLING'S bold imagery of BOBS sitting on a bucking
charger,
With a smile round both yer ears,
Ain't ye Bobs?
CAUBTON just bustled in, holding telegram at arm's length. It is
the reading of this that has broken the monotony of Committee with
noise of cheering, and dashed a smile along the Ministerial benches
like a sudden flash of sunlight. Only for this merry mood, one
entering the House at this particular moment might fear the worst.
HANBURY been at it hour alter hour since Tuesday, when House got
into Committee on Navy Estimates. CAWMELL-BANNERMAN, a
person of imperturbable temper. But there are limits to human
endurance; now they seem to have been reached. This telegram
CAUSTON has brought in and handed to War Minister doubtless
announces that all is ready: a file of soldiers waits on the Terrace;
HANBURY will be seized, bound, carried forth, blindfolded, shot;
and then the Committee will really get to business, and vote Supply.
A sad fate for one only moderately middle-aged. Tu Pas roitlu
ROBERT WILLIAM. Still, cannot withhold the tear of pity as the
hapless man stands clutching at the extended white flag which
announces his capitulation, his entreaty for pardon, his promise of
side when he yielded. But what happened? At quarter past ten
better conduct in future.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Ask SAHK if he won't say something for
the doomed man. SARK, in language not to
be here repeated, explains that things are
not what they seem. Fact is, HANBURY has
somewhere obtained (in what manner, SAHK
hints, may be matter for police inquiry) a
portion of sheeting, the property of HER
MAJESTY, supplied to soldiers. This he has
brought down, intending to confound CAW-
MELL-BANNKHMAN. Happened to bring it
out just at the moment when news arrived
of a great Liberal victory snatched at the
polls at Attereliffe. That's all.
Easiness done. — Two votes in Army
Estimates.
House of Lords, Friday.—Peers not
habitually given to tears. To-night the
MAJJKISS plunged them (especially Ministers)
into condition of abject woe. Only said
that England was the head-quarters of the
Anarchist operations, the laboratory in
which all their contrivances were hatched.
ROSEBERY jumped at opportunity with in-
tuition of Old Parliamentary Hand. En-
larged upon it with skill of born debater.
MAKKISS saw his mistake. Hadn't meant
anything; only his way of putting a case.
But here was ROSEBERY pitilessly making
it clear how the Leader of the Patriot
Party had given his country away to the
Paris gossips ; how he had assumed a state
of things which, set forth on authority of
ex-Priine Minister and ex-Secretary of State
for Foreign Affairs, would be made much
of by the enemy abroad.
MARKISS for once so singed by his own
blazing indiscretion that he did not wait for
SCHOMBERG MACDONNELi/s convenient cor-
respondent, but forthwith endeavoured to
explain away his remarks. This led only
to tears coursing more rapidly down ROSE-
BERT'S pained face, whilst SPENCER forlornly
shook his beard as if it were the flag of
England drooping under the shamed skies,
and KIMBERLEY dolefully dropped his head.
A pretty scene, admirably staged and acted.
Business done.—The MARKISS puts his
foot in it.
The Two Sarahs.
0 WOMAN, you romp in with ease!
If you 're not proud you 're hard to please:
Men talk to-day on every hand
Of "the Grand SARA" and "SARAH GRAND."

Enylith Tourist. "I HAVE SEES THAT, PAT. I WEST THERE Two YEARS

Irish Jurcey. "AH, YER HONOUR, SHURE THEY'VE ADDED TO THE SCENERY
SIKCE THAT TOIME!"
STARTLING FOR HER.—Mrs. li.'s niece read out the heading of a
Paragraph in the Duily Graphic last Thursday, which sounded to
er attentive aunt like " The New Baby." Mrs. R. was all attention,
expecting some gratifying intelligence from White Lodge. Imagine
her astonishment when her niece continued, "An addition to the
collection of the Zoological Society of London was made last week"
"What!!!" exclaimed Mrs. R., and her niece continued.) "When
a gnu was barn at the menagerie in Regent's Park." The excellent
lady was dumb with amazement. Then her niece showed her the
heading which was " A Gnu Baby," with the illustration of the gnu
baby and the old mother.
PHOSPHORESCENCE IN ART.—Said Professor DEWAB, in a recent lec-
ture, "A perfectly clean plate of metal does not phosphoresce, but
the merest trace of grease - such as is left by the touch of the hand
—will make it brightly luminous." Take, adds Mr. Punch, byway
of example, a perfectly clean plate of metal, apply to it the hand of
a skilled etcher, say of Professor HCIIERT HBBKOMEH, R.A., and the
result will be brightly luminous, and what is more, it will last, and
its bright luminosity will increase with age.
YIVF, ROSEBF.RY!—The owner of Ladas celebrated the Derby
triumph with an entertainment to the Kpsom Poor of the Union
Workhouse, all Unionists, of course, which makes the Premier's
Ladasian horse-pitality still more noble. "This week His Lordship
entertains the Epsom tradesmen," so it is announced. One of the
entertainments will be of a novel naval character, and will consist of
a hornpipe by the celebrated Old Epsom Salts. Afterwards nautical
REALLY SENSIBLE.—The Lord Chief Justice of England, Lord
RPSSELL of Killowen, (and if there is anything in a name isn't this
"Justice to Ireland" ':} will commence his judicial duties, after the
swearing is over, to-day, Wednesday. His Lordship has appointed
Mr. R. J. BLOCK to be his Chief Clerk. Excellent appointment!
Especially in this summer heat, as when oppressed by the weight of
his Ipgal wig, the Lord Chief will simply take it off and put it on
the Block.
SHE Ksows!—Mrs. R. is much pained on hearing that in some
parts of the Potteries the favourite song is the well-known one
containing the lines :—
The beating of hia own wifu
Was all the sound he heard.
As she shrewdly remarks, this indicates the manner in which the
cottar in this district is accustomed to spend his Saturday night.
OOH TOBY AND nis ANXIOUS FRIENDS.—Mr. Punch has received
several letters reminding him that the Duke of RUTLAND is a Cantab,
not an Oxonian as stated in our TOBY'S " Essence " for June 30. TOUT
is delighted to hear it. He will remember in future that "Mr.
Crummies is not a Prussian," &c., &c.
"LONDON PLAYGROUNDS."—Drury Lane, Lyceum, Haymarket,
Toole's, &c., &c. The respective managers say they prefer to tee

THE VOLUNTEER'S VADE MECUM.
(Bisley Billion.)
Question. What is the ambition of every
rifleman?
Answer. To become an expert marksman.
Q. How is this to be done Tf
A. By practice at the regimental butts
(where such accommodation exists), and ap-
pearing at Liisley.
Q. Is the new site of the National Rifle
Association better than the last?
A. Certainly, for those who come to Bisley
intend to choot.
Q. But did anyone turn up at Wimbledon
for anv purpose other than marksmanship '<
A. Yes, for many of those who occupied the
tents used their marquees merely as a suitable
resting-place for light refreshments.
Q. Is there anything of that kind at Buley?
A. Not much, as the nearest place of inte-
rest is a crematorium, and the most beautiful
grounds in the neighbourhood belong to a
cemetery.
Q. Then the business of Bisley is shoot-
ing?
A. Distinctly. Without the rifle, the place
would be as melancholy as its companion
spot, Woking.
Q.^ In this place of useful work, what is
the first object of the marksman '(
A. To score heavily, if possible; but, at
any rate, to score.
Q. Is it necessary to appear in uniform?
A. That depends upon the regulations
commanding the prize competitions,
Q. What is uniform?
A. As much or as little of the dress of a
corps that a judge will order a marksman to
adopt.
Q. If some marksmen were paraded with
their own corps, how would they look?
A. They would appear to be a sorry sight.
Q. Why would they appear to be a sorry i
sight?
A. Because over a tunic would appear a
straw hat, and under a pouch-belt fancy
tweed trousers.
Q. But surely if the Volunteers are anxious I
to improve themselves they will practise
"smartness"?
A. But they do not want to promote smart-
ness; they wan', to win cups, or the value of
cups.
Q. What is the greatest reward that a
marksman can obtain r1
A. Some hundreds of pounds.
Q. And the smallest?
A. A dozen of somebody's champagne, or
a box of someone else's soap.
Q. Under all the circumstances of the case;
what would be an appropriate rule for Bisley'(
A. Look after the cup-winning, andevery-
j thing else will take care of itself.

And several acts in each. And first the infant,
A vernal blossom of the Garrick Caste,
Playing the super in his bassinet,
And innocently causing some chagrin
To Mr. ECCLES. Then there's Archibald,
Xew Boy, and nearly father to the man.
With mourning on his face and kicks behind.
Returning under strong connubial stress
Unwillingly to school. And next the lover,
Sighing like ALEXANDER for fresh fields,
And plunging wof ully to win a kiss,
Even to his very eyebrows. Then the soldier,
Armed with strange maxims and a carpet-bag,
Cock-Shaw in military ironies,
And blowing off the bubbling repartee [stuff,
With chocolate in'his mouth. And next is .FW-
In fair round belly with good bolsters lined,
Full of wide sores, and badly cut about
By Windsor husiies,—modern instances
Of the revolting woman. Sixthly, Charley's
A tint.
Now ancient as the earth, and shifting still
The Penley pantaloons for ladies' gear,
Her tine heroic waist a world too wide
For the slim corset, and her manly lips,
Tuned to the treble of a maiden'e pipe.
Grasping a big cigar. Last scene of all,
The season's close and mere oblivion;
Away to Europe and the provinces;
| And London left forlorn without them all,
! Suns-Gene, Santuzza, yea, sans everything.

of example, a perfectly clean plate of metal, apply to it the hand of

VIVE ROSEBEBY!—The owner of Latlas celebrated the Derby
triumph with an entertainment to the Kpsom Poor of the Union
Workhouse, all Unionists, of course, which makes the Premier's
Ladasian horse-pitnlity still more noble. "This week His Lordship
entertains the Epsom tradesmen," so it is announced. One of the
entertainments will be of a novel naval character, and will consist of
a hornpipe by the celebrated Old Epsom Salts. Afterwards nautical
REALLY SENSIBLE.—The Lord Chief Justice of England, Lord
RrssELL of Killowen, (and if there is anything in a name isn't this
"Justice to Ireland " ':) will commence his judicial duties, after the
swearing is over, to-day, Wednesday. His Lordship has appointed
Mr. R. J. BLOCK to be his Chief Clerk. Excellent appointment!
Especially in this summer heat, as when oppressed by the weight of
his Ipgal wig, the Lord Chief will simply take it off and put it on
the Block.

parts of the Potteries the favourite song is the well-known one
containing the lines :—
The beating of liis own wife1

As she shrewdly remarks, this indicates the manner in. which the

A RIVERSIDE LAMENT,
IN my garden, where the rose
By the hundred gaily blows,
And the river freshly flows
Close to me,' "•>•".••!«
I can spend the summer day
In a quite idyllic way;
Simply charming, you would
say,
Could you see.
I am far from stuft'y town,
Where the soots meander
down,
And the air seems — being
brown—
Close to me.
I am far from rushing train:
Bradshaiv does not bore my
brain,
Nor, comparatively plain,
A B (.
To my punt I can repair,
If the weather's fairly fair,
Butone grievance! havethere;
Close to me.
As I sit and idly dream,
Clammy corpses ever seem
Floating down the placid
stream
To the sea.
Though the boats that crowd
the lock—
Such an animated block !—
Bring gay damsels, quite a
Hock,'
Close to me,
Yet I heed not tasty togs,
When, as motionless as logs,
Float defunct and dismal cogs
There aussi.

As in Egypt at a feast,
With each party comes at least
One sad corpse, departed beast,
Close to me;
Till a Canon might go off,
Till a Dean might swear or scoff,
Or a Bishop—tip-top toff
In a see.
Floating to me from above,
If it stick, with gentle shove,
To my neighbour, whom I love,
Close to me,
I send on each gruesome guest.
Should 1 drag it out to rest
In my garden? No, I 'm blest!
Nun, tnerei!

HOTEL NOTE.—The chef at

THE VOLTTNTEEE'S VADE MECUM.
(Bislcy Eilitwn.)
Question. What is the ambition of every
rifleman?
Ansicer. To become an expert marksman.
Q. How is this to be done?
A. By practice at the regimental butts
(where such accommodation exists), and ap-
pearing at bisley.
Q. Is the new site of the National Ride
Association better than the last?
A. Certainly, for those who come to Binley
intend to thoot.
(I. But did anyone turn up at Wimbledon
for anv purpose other than marksmanship?
A. Yes, for many of those who occupied the
tents used their marquees merely as a suitable
resting-place for light refreshments.
Q. Is there anything of that kind at Bif ley?
A. Not much, as the nearest place of inte-
rest i§ a crematorium, and the most beautiful
grounds in the neighbourhood belong to a
cemetery.
Q. Then the business of Bislcy is shoot-
ing?
A. Distinctly. Without the rifle, the place
would be as melancholy as its companion
spot, Woking.
Q. In this place of useful work, what is
the first object of the marksman?
A. To score heavily, if possible; but, at
any ratfi, to Bcore.
Q. Is it necessary to appear in uniform?
A. That depends upon the regulations
commanding the prize competitions.
Q. What is uniform?
A. As much or as little of the dress of a
corps that a judge will order a marksman to
adopt.
<i. If some marksmen were paraded with
their own corps, how would they look?
A. They would appear to be a sorry sight.
Q. Why would they appear to be a sorry
sight?
A. Because over a tunic would appear a
straw hat, and under a pouch-belt fancy
tweed trousers.
Q. But surely if the Volunteers are anxious
to improve themselves they will practise
"smartness"?
A. But they do not want lo promote smart-
ness; they wan', to win cups, or the value of i
cups.
Q. What is the greatest reward that a
marksman can obtain':
A. Some hundreds of pounds.
Q. And the smallest?
A. A dozen of somebody's champagne, or
a box of someone else's soap.
Q. Under all the circumstances of the ease,
what would be an appropriate rule for Bislcy?
A. Look after the cup-winning, and every-
thing else will take care of itself.

—ALL the world's upon the stage,
And here and thxrc you really get a player:
The exits rather than the entrances
Are regulated by the County Council;
And one man in a season sees a lot—
Seven plays a week, including matinees,
And several acts in each. And first the infant,
A vernal blossom of the Garriek Caste,
Playing the super in his bassinet,
And innocently causing some chagrin
To Mr. ECCLES. Then there's Archibald,
Xew Soy, and nearly father to the man.
With mourning on his face and kicks behind.
Returning under strong connubial stress
Unwillingly to school. And next the lover,
Sighing like ALEXANDER for fresh fields,
And plunging wof ully to win a kiss,
Even to his very eyebrows. Then the soldier,
Armed with strange maxims and a carpet-bag,
Cock-Shaw in military ironies,
And blowing off the bubbling repartee [stuff,
With chocolate in'his mouth. And next is Fal-
In fair round belly with good bolsters lined,
Full of wide sores, and badly cut about
By Windsor hussies,—modern instances
Of the revolting woman. Sixthly, Churley't
Aunt.
Now ancient as the earth, and shifting still
The Penley pantaloons for ladies' gear,
Her tine heroic waist a world too wide
For the slim corset, and her manly lips,
Tuned to the treble of a maiden'e pipe.
Grasping a big cigar. Last scene of all,
The season's close and mere oblivion;
Away to Europe and the provinces;
And London left forlorn without them all,
Sans-G'ene, Xantuzza, yea, sans everything.

A MODERN MADAME.
(According to the New School of Teachers.)
SHE believes in nothing but herself, and never accepts her own
personality seriously.
She has aspirations after the impossible, and is herself far from
probable; she regards her husband as an unnecessary evil, and her
children as disturbances without compensating advantages.
She writes more than she reads and seldom scribbles anything.
She has no feelings, and yet has a yearning after the intense.
She is the antithesis of her grandmother, and has made further
development in generations to come quite impossible.
She thinks without the thoughts of a male, and yet has lost the
comprehension of a female.
To sum up, she is hardly up to the standard of a man, and yet has
sunk several fathoms below the level of a woman.

bably only half understand—but out
of mere idle curiosity to see what
manner of strange beast a Poet may
be! And / don't know this Lady

simply to please them f
Drys. I should think it a doubtful kindness, in your present frame
of mind; and, as you are hardly going to please yourself, wouldn't

it be more dignified, on the whole, not to go at all?
Und. You never did understand me! Sometimes I think I was
born to be misunderstood! But you might do me the justice to
believe that I am not going from merely snobbish motives. May
I not feel that such a recognition as this is a tribute less to my -poor
self than to Literature, and that, as such, I have scarcely the right
to decline it?

Und. Or what if I am going to show these Patricians that—Poet
of the People as I am—they can neither patronise nor cajole me?

romantic one—but yon would only sneer if I told you! I know you

show it some day; there are even signs of it in Andromeda here and
there; but you'll do better things than that, if you'll only let some
of the wind out of your head. I like you, old fellow, and that's
just why it riles me to see you taking yourself so devilish seriously
on the strength of a little volume of verse which has been "boomed''

THE LATEST GREAT YACHT ItACE.
(By our oirn Nautical Special.)
DEAR SIR,—The captain went on hoard the gallant Naughty Lais
with his Wind Lass. A Wind Lass is short for " Winn'd Lass," i.e.
a Lass he has won. I think her name is "POLL." The Captain says
he is always true to her, and nothing will ever induce him to leave
his dear Wind Lass ashore when he's afloat. Noble sentiment, but
unpractical. The fact is (as whispered) the Wind Lass is jealous of the
Naughty Lass, and won t let the Captain go alone. When the other
Captain went on board the rival of the gallant Naughty Lass, the
Anne Nemone, and " the crafty ones," as they call the sailors "in the
know," were ready to bet any money on the Anne Nemone. Both
cutters "cut" (hence the name) well away from each other at the
start, and a fresh breeze coming up (the stale one had been got rid of)
there was a lot of fore-reaching, until the Captain, who is an old hand
at this sort of thing, sent round steward with brandy. "All hands for
grog!" was then the order of the day, and we just managed to clear
Muddle Point, leaving the home-marked (or " home-made," I forget
which is the technical term, hut I suppose the latter, as she was
built on the neighbouring premises) boat well to windward. After a
free reach in this weather down to Boot Shore—where the vessel
heeled over a hit, but nothing to speak of, as it was soon remedied
by a cobble that was close at hand—the Naughty Lass lifted her
head-sails, and away we went for Incog Bay, where nobody knew
us, or we should have been received with three times three.
At this moment the Anne Nemone, racing close to us, let out a
right good "gybe," which was in execrable taste, I admit,but which
ought not to have called for any retort from the captain's Wind
Lass, who gave it her hot and strong, and threatened to haul her over
the coal-scuttlers. Fortunately we were away again, and there was
no time for opposite gybes. (I spell "gybes "m the old English
nautical fashion, but, as I ascertain, it is precisely the same as" jibes.")
Sailors' language is a bit odd; they don't mean anything, I know—
it's only professional; still, as reporting the matter to ears polite,
I scarcely like to set down in full all I heard. At 1 P.M. all hands
were piped for luncheon, and we had spinnakers cooked in their skins
(they are a sort of bean), with a rare nautical dish called "Booms
and Bacon." Fine! I did enjoy it! But then I 'm an old hand at
this sort of thing,—luncheon on hoard, I mean; for there's scarcely
a board, be it sea board or other board, or, in fact, any boarding
establishment, that I don't know. But "yeo ho! my hoys! and
avast!" for are we not still racing? We are!!
We passed The Bottle at 2.30 P.n. What had become of the
Anne Nemone I don't know, and probably we should never have
seen her again had not our captain, who was trying to sipht the
j)ort after passing The Bottle, stood on the wrong tack, which ran
into his boot and hurt him awfully. He was carried below, and we

"OH, I SY! WHAT SEEDS THEM MUST BE TO
mured—but POLLY objected that there was nothing to murmur about
or to grumble at, and that the sooner he stumbled on deck the
better it would be for Ihe race. 80 up rose our brave captain, totk a
stiff draught of weather bilge (which is the best preventive of sea-
sickness), and calling for his first mate, Mr. JACK YARD TOPSAIL,
told him to "stand away," which I could quite understand, for JACK
YARD TOPSAIL is a regular salt, lull of tar, rum, 'baccy, and every-
thing that can make life sweet to Aim, but nut to his immediate neigh-
bours. So " stand away" and not "stand by" it was, and when we
got to Squeams Bay the sailors took a short hitch (it is necessary occa-
sionally—but I cannot say more—lady-readers being present), and we
went streaking away like a side of bacon on a fine day.
"Are we winning:"' ae-ks POLLY, the Wind Lass. "I'OK look
winning!" I reply, politely. "By how much'(" she inquires, just
tucking up her skirts, and showing a trim ankle. The Captain, with
his glass to his eye, and looking down, answers, " The fifth of a long
leg!" I never saw a woman so angry!" I haven't!" she exclaimed;
and there would have been a row, and we should never have won, as
we did splendidly, had not the " First Officer" (j list as they name the
supernumeraries in a play) come up and reminded Pretty POLLY that
she wasn't the only mate the Captain had on board. "Where's the
other?" she cried, in a fury. "Below!" answered the First Officer,
and down went POLLY, not to re-appear again until all was over, and
our victorious binnacle was waving proudly from the fore-top-gallant.
At the finish we went clean into harbour, without a speck on our
forecastle, or a stain on our character. I wire vou the account of
this great race, and am (Kule BRITANNIA !) Yours,
"KVEHY OTIIHI INCH A SAILOR!"
P.S.—I am informed that after I left the vessel - in fact it was
next day a Burgee was run up at the mast head. I suppose some
sort of court-martial was held first, and that the Burgee (poor
wretch !) was caught red-handed. Still, in these days, this sort of
proceeding does sound rather tyrannical. High-masted justice, <h!'
Well, sea-dogs will be sea-dogs. I don't exactly know what a Burgee
is, but I fancy he is something between a Buccaneer and a Bargee;
a sort of river-and-sea pirate. But I fear it is a landsman!!
Burgee, masculine (and probably husband) of Burgess!! If so, there
gathered round him as he turned to the Naughty lass and mur-
tcill be a row! YOURS AS BEFORE THE MAST.

THE MINX. A POEM IN PROSE.
Poet. IT'S so pood of you to see
me. I merely wished to ask one or
two questions as to your career. You
must have led a most interesting life.
Sphinx. You are very inquisitive
and extremely indiscreet, and I have
always carefully avoided being inter-
viewed. However, go on.
Poet. I believe you can read hiero-
glyphs?
Sphinx. Oh yes; I ran, fluently.
But I never do. I assure you they
are not in the least amusing.
Poet. No doubt you have talked
with hippogriffs and basilisks?
Sphinx (modestly). I certainly was
in rather a smart set at one time. As
they say, I have "known betterdays."
Poet. Did you ever have any con-
versation with THOTH?
Sphinx (loftily}. Oh, dear no!
(Mimicking.) Thoth he wathnotcon-
thidered quite a nice perthon. 1 would
not allow nim to be introduced to me.
Poet. You were very particular?
Sphinx. One has to be careful.
The world is so censorious.
Poet. I wonder, would you give
me the pleasure of singing to me?
"Adrian't Gilded Surge," for
instance?
Sphinx. You must really excuse
me. I am not in good voice. By the
way, the "Gilded Barge." as-you
call it, was merely a shabby sort of
pnnt. It would have had no effect
whatever at the Henley Regatta.
Poet. Dear me! Is it true you
played golf among the Pyramids?
Sphinx (emphatically). Perfectly
untrue. You see what absurd reports
get about!

Poet (softly). They do. What was
that story about the Tyrian?
Sphinx. Merely gossip. There was
nothing in it, I assure you.
Poet. And APIS?
Sphinx. Oh, he sent me some
flowers, and there were paragraphs
about it—in hieroglyphs — in the
society papers. That was all. But
they were contradicted.
Poet. You knew AMMON very
well, I believe P
Sphinx (frankly). AMMON and I
were great pals. I used to see a
good deal of him. He came in to tea
very often— he was quite interesting.
But I have not seen him for a long
time. He had one fault—he would
smoke in the drawing-room. And
though I hope I am not too conven-
tional, I really could not allow that.
Poet. How pleased thev would all
be to see you again! Why do you
not go over to Egypt for the winter?
Sphinx. The hotels at Cairo are so
dreadfully expensive.
Poet. Is it true you went tunny-
fishing with ANTONY '•!
Sphinx. One must draw the line
somewhere! CLEOPATRA was so cross.
She was horribly jealous, and not
nearly so handsome as you might sup-
pose, though she irat photographed
as a " type of Egyptian Beauty 1"
Poet. I must thank you very much
for the courteous way in which you
have replied to my questions. And
now will you forgive me if I make
an observation? In my opinion you
are not a Sphinx at all.
Sphinx (indignantly). What am I,
then '•! Poet. A Minx.

In any character could score a
Distinctly leonine success,

Poet. IT'S so good of you to see
me. I merely wished to ask one or
two questions as to your career. You
must have led a most interesting life.
Sphinx. You are very inquisitive
and extremely indiscreet, and I have
always carefully avoided being inter-
viewed. However, go on.
Poet. I believe you can read hiero-
glyphs?
Sphinx. Oh yes; I ran, fluently.
But I never do. I assure you they
are not in the least amusing.
Poet. No doubt you have talked
with hippogriffs and basilisks?
Sphinx (modestly). I certainly was
in rather a smart set at one time. As

about it—in hieroglyphs — in the

were great pals. I used to see a
good deal of him. He came in to tea
very often- he was quite interesting.
But I have not seen him for a long
time. He had one fault—he woiM
smoke in the drawing-room. And
though I hope I am not too conven-
tional, I really could not allow that.
Poet. How pleased they would all
be to see you again! Why do you
not go over to Kgypt for the winter?
Sphinx. The hotels at Cairo are so
dreadfully expensive.
Poet. Is it true you went tunny-

House of Lords, Monday, July 9.—PLAYFAIB'S leonine coun-
tenance habitually cheerful. But never saw him looking so pleased
as when we walked through St. Stephen's Chapel on way to Lordsjust
now. "From point of view of old House of Commons man the Lords
are, I admit, a little unresponsive," my Lord said. "The chamber is,
acoustically and otherwise, the sepulchre of speech. You remember
the little lecture on
margarine I delivered
years ago in the Com-
mons P Bless me, how
delighted the House
was to see the table
covered with small
white pots containing
samples, with a bottle
of best Dorset marga-
rine hooked on to the
Mace for greater con-
venience of reference.
Often I've enchained
an audience with my
object lessons. Up to
present time that mo-
nologue on margarine
ranks as most suc-
cessful. But I '11 beat
the record to-night.
See that?": (Here he
slapped a something
bulging out from his
trouser pocket.)
"Guess what that is't
Thought you couldn't.
It 's cnltch. Know
what cultch is?"
"Not unless it's
the beginning of know-
ledge," I said, draw-
ing a bow, so to speak,
at a venture. "Posi-
tive cultch, compara-
tive culture, eh 't"

with their rates; were Death Duties applicable to some of them; if
so, which; and whether the tenants compounded for rates or other-

remarkable for concentration of thought or conciseness of phrase.
At length PLAYFAIB'S turn came. A nutter of interest amongst
Peers as he was observed tugging at something in trousers pocket;
hauled out what looked like empty oyster shell.
"Ah!" said HEBSCHELL, smiling, "I gee the lawyers have been
before us."
"In moving the Second Reading of the Sea Fisheries (Shell Fish)
Bill, I propose, if I may be permitted, to give your Lordships
an pbject lesson. This particular shell." PLAYFAIB continued,
holding it up between linger and thumb, "is covered all over with
microscopic oysters. Oysters in all stages of growth are seen there."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Business done.—Considering and nega-
tiving new Clauses to Budget Bill.
Thursday.—All the cheerfulness of to-day
has brightened Committee-room, where ques-
tion of issue of Writ, following on appli-
cation for Chiltern Hundreds, is considered.
The SQUIRE under examination for nearly
two hours and a-half. Difficult to say which
the more enjoyed it, the witness or the Com-
mittee.
"What is the state of a Peer pending issue
of Writ of Summons?" asked the SQUIRE,
suddenly taking to interrogate the Com-
mittee assembled to question him. "Is he a
caterpillar passing through a larva, spinning i
a cocoon of silk until he reaches a condition j
where they toil not neither do they spin?"
(Here, quite by accident, his glance fell upon
JOSEPH, supposed to be sitting upon him in
judicial capacity.) "There is," he continued
(and here he glanced at PRINCE ARTHUR,
smiling at the sly hit dealt at his dear friend
JOE) an opening for philosophic doubt as
to the precise condition of this impounded
Peer in nis intermediary state."
The House still going about with millstone
of Budget Bill round its neck, BYRNE,
BUTCHER, BEACH, BOWLES and BAKTLEY
tugging at it, KENYON-SLAXEY now and then
uttering obvious truths with air of super-
natural wisdom. GRAND YOTJNG GARDNER
(address Board of Agriculture, Whitehall
Place, >S. W.) hands me scrap of paper; says
he found it near SQUIRE'S seat on Treasury
Bench; but it doesn't look like his writing: \
"Two modes there are, 0 BYRNE and lirTCHEE,
Our gratitude to earn:
If JJvitNE would only burn up UVTCHER,
Or Bi'TCHKR butcher UYRNK;
Or both combine—yes, blesa their souls—
To burn and butcher TOMMY ]{UWLKK!"
Business done.—Very little.
Friday.— TKMPLI-: going about much as if
on Tuesday night he had got out of his cab
in the ordinary fashion. He didn't, you
know. Taken out in sections through the
upper window by couple of stalwart police-
men. This owing to circumstance that Irish
cab - driver having, after fashion of his
country, saved a trot for the avenue, dashed
up against kerbstone and overturned cab.
"Gave me a start, of course," TEMPLE
said, as we brushed him down. "Not a
convenient way of getting out of your
hansom. Whit I was afraid of was being
disfigured. Am not a vain man, but don't
mind telling you, Tour, a scratch or a scar
on one's faee would have been exceedingly
annoying. But I 'm all right, as you see.
Hope it isn't a portent. A small thing that
under this Government I should be over-
turned. What I fear is, that unless we
keep our eye on them they'll overturn the
Empire."

"You remarkably rum-spelt land, you,

The Prince tried hard, but the songs he heard
Very soon brought his proud soul under,
With twenty consonants packed in a word,
And no vowels to keep them asunder!

LORD ORMONPS MATE AND MATEY'S AMINTA.
VOLUME I.
BY G"*GE M'R'D'TH.
His admiration of the cavalry-brother rose to a fever-point. Not
THIS was a school. Small wonder if the boys, doubly sensitive good with the pen, Ladv CHARLOTTE opined; hard to* beat at a
under a supercilious head-master of laughter-moving invention, sword-thrust, thought MATEY. "Be his pen-holder," put in the
poised for a moment on the to and fro of a needless knockabout jig-
face with chin and mouth all a-pucker for
the inquisitive contest. The stout are
candid puff-balls blowing in an open sea
of purposeless panting, hard to stir into
an elephantine surging from arm-chairs;
and these are for frock-coats, and they
can wear watch-chains. So these boys
understood it. MURAT here, MCKAT there,
MURAT everywhere, with SHALDERS
a-burst at the small end of a trumpet,
cheeks rounded to the full note of an
usher's eulogy, like a roar and no mis-
take, arduous in the moment, throbbing
beneath a schoolmaster's threadbare waist-
coat, a heart all dandelions to the plucker,
yellow on top with white shifts for feather-
fringe; or a daisy, transferring petulance
on a bath-chair wheezing and groaning—
on the swing for the capture of a fare—or
shall it be a fair, that too a wheeze per-
mitted to propriety hoist on a flaxy,
grinning chub. This was SHALDERS.
Lady CHARLOTTE EGLETT appeared.
Hers was the brother, the Lord OBMONT
we know, a general of cavalry not a
doubt, all sabretache, spurs and plumes,
dashing away into a Hindoo desert like
the soldier he is, a born man sword in fist.
She wrote, "Come to me. He is said to
be married."
• He spoke to her. "My father was a
soldier.^
"He too ?" she interposed.
Their eyes clashed.
"You are the tutor for me," she added.
"For your grandson," corrected he.
It was a bargain. They struck it.

lady. "I ii-iiii/if," said he, smiling again. She split sides, con-
vulsed in a take-offish murmur, a roll
here, a roll there, rib-tickling with eyes
goggling on the forefront of a sentence
all rags, tags, and splutters like a jerry-
builder gaping at a waste land pegged out
in plots, foundations on the dig, and auc-
tioneer prowling hither thither, hammer
ready for the " gone " which shall spin a
nobody's land into a somebody's money
passing over counter or otherwise pocket to
pocket, _full to empty or almost empty, with
a mowling choke-spark of a batter-foot all
quills for the beau-feast. So they under-
stood it.
MATEY then was Lord ORM9NT's secre-
tary. A sad dog his Lordship; all the
women on bended knees to his glory. Who
shall own him': What cares he so it be a
petticoat? For women go the helter-skelter
pace ; head-first they plunge or kick like
barking cuckoos. You can tether them with
a dab for Sir FRANCIS JEUNE. He will
charge a jury to the right-about of a
crapulous fallow-ball, stiff as Rhadaman-
thus eyeing the tremblers. But MATEY
had met this one before. Memories came
pouring. He gazed. Was she, in truth.
Lord ORJIONT'S? The thought spanked
him in the face. A wife? Possibly. And
with an aunt—AMINTA'S aunt. She has a
nose like a trout skimming a river for
flies, then rises a minute and you not
there, always too late with rod and line
for sjort. But there was danger to
these two, and Lord OIOION r was writing his Memoirs. A mad
splashing of unnecessary ink on the foolscap made for his head,

A VADE MECUM FOR THE NAVAL
MANCEUVRES.
(Compiled by a Pessimist.)
Question. Will the Naval Manoeuvres of
1894 have any novel features?
Anitrer. Only in the imagination of the
special correspondents.
Q. Will there be the customary coloured
fleets?
A. Yes, with the usual commanders,
officers and men.
Q. Will the lesson that a fleet having speed
equal to a pursuing fleet, if given a start, will
escape, be taught to all concerned?
A. Yes, to the great admiration of the
authorities at Somerset House and Whitehall.
Q. Will it be demonstrated that if a town
on the coast is left undefended, a hostile iron-
clad will be able to bombard it at pleasure?
A. Yes, to the satisfaction of every scientist
in the United Kingdom.
Q. Will it also be made clear to the
meanest comprehension that if the night is
sufficiently dark, and search-lights insuffi-
cient, a fleet will get out of a harbour in spite
of considerable opposition?
• A. Yes, to the great appreciation of the
world at large, and the British public in par-
ticular.
Q. Will there be the customary secrecy
about self-evident facts and trivial details?
A. Yes, to the annoyance of the news-
paper correspondents, and the indignation of
editors thirsting for copy.
Q. And, lastly, how may the Naval If an-
eenvres be appropriately defined?
A. As the means of obtaining the minimum
of information at the maximum of expense.
A PAINFUL POSITION.
IT is my base biographer
I 've haunted all day long.
He's writing out my character,
And every word is wrong.
With the wrong vices I 'm indued,
And the wrong virtues too;
My motives he has misconstrued
As only he could do.
I read the copy sheet by sheet
As it issues from his pen,
And this, this travesty complete
Will be my doom from men!
I 've wrestled hard with psychic force—
It is in vain, in vain 1
His nerves were ever tough and coarse,
Impervious his brain.
Ah, could a merely psychic spell
Ignite an earthly match!
Or could a hand impalpable
Material " copy" snatch 1
I 'm as incompetent as mist
The enemy to rack.
Ah, if a spiritual fist
An earthly eye could black!
A paper-weight it lies below,
It cannot be dispersed!
The publisher will never know
Who read that copy first 1
His gliding pen, for all my hate,
Has never gone awry;
"All rights reserved," they'll calmly
state,
O'er me. And here am I!
GUESSES AT GOODWOOD.
(By a Tranmtlantic Cotisin, acm-tiiny to English
ideas.)
THAT I shall get puppar to take me and
mother down in real style.
That we will wake up sleepy old Europe,
and show these insolent insulars that we are
above small potatos.
That I shall cut out the Britisher Misses,
and make their mummars sit up.
That 1 shall take care that luncheon is not
neglected, and see that all my party, like the
omnibuses, are full inside.
That I shall think very small of the races,
so long as I get my boxes of gloves.
That I shall do credit to the best society of
Boston and the seminaries of New York by
speaking through my nose a mixture of slang
and nonsense.
That I shall call bis Grace of Canterbury
"Archbishop," and any owner of strawberry
leaves " Duke."
That I shall wear a gown trimmed with
diamonds, and have my parasols made of net
and precious stones. That I shall conceal the
fact that puppar made his money out of the
sale of wooden nutmegs and mother's aunt
was a laundress.
That I shall flirt with a Duke at the Races,
marry him at St. George's, and give up for
ever the stars and stripes.
P.S. (by a Transatlantic Coutin, according
to American idea*).—I shall continue to won-
der at an English girl's notions of her kins-
women when there are so many charming
specimens of refined Columbian gentlewomen
resettled in the old home of the Anglo- Saxon
race.

PART IV.—RUSHING TO CONCLUSIONS.
SCENE IV.—A First- Class Compartment.
Spun-ell (to himself). Formidable old party opposite me in the
furs! Nice-looking girl over in the corner; not a patch on my
EMMA, though! Wonder why I catch 'em sampling me over their
papers whenever I look up! Can't be anything wrong with my turn
out. Why, of course, they heard TOM talk about my going down
to Wyvern Court; think I 'm a visitor there and no end of a nob!
Well, what snobs some people are, to be sure!
Lady Cantire (to herself). So this is the young poet I made
ALBINIA ask to meet me. I can't be mistaken, 1 distinctly heard his ,
friend mention Andromeda. H'm, well, it's a comfort to find'
Lady Cant, (with a dignified littU shiver). With a temperature as
glacial as it is in here! Surely not!

beginning to doubt whether it was quite prudent to bring MAISIE;
but I needn't have worried myself.

Spurr. Oh—er—well, you knoWj I only meant, bring on blindness
and that. Harmless attempt at a joke, that 'a all.
Lady Cant. I see. I scarcely expected that you would condescend
to such weakness. I—ah—think you are going down to stay at
"Wyvern for a few days, are you not?
Spurr (to himself). I was right. What TOM said did fetch the
old girl; no harm in humouring her a hit. (Aloud.) Yes—oh yes,
they—aw—wanted me to run down when I could.
Lady Cant. I heard they were expecting you. You will find
Wyvern a pleasant house—for a short visit.
Spurr (to himself). She heard! Oh, she wants to kid me she
knows the CULVEBLNS. Rats! (Aloud.) Shall I, though? I daresay.
Lady Cant. Lady CULVEBIN is a very sweet woman; a little
limited, perhaps, not intellectual, or quite what one would call the
grande dame; hut perhaps that could scarcely be expected.
Spurr. (vaguely). Oh, of course not—no. (To himself.) If she
bluffs, so can I! (Aloud.) It's funny your turning out to be an
acquaintance of Lady C.'s, though.

Lady Cant, (graciously). You've said nothing whatever to dis-

who I was. Perhaps I had better tell you at once that I am Lady
CANTIBE, and this is my daughter, Lady MAISIE MULL. (SruRBELL
returns Lady MATSIE'S little boic in the deepest confusion.) We are
going down to Wyvern too, so I hope we shall very soon become
better acquainted.
Spurr. (to himself, overwhelmed). The deuce we shall! I hare
got myself into a hole this time; I wish I could see my way well out

shall look an ass when I tell 'em.

SCEXEV.—A Second- Clttss Compartment.
L'ndershcll (to himself). Singularly attractive face this girl has;
so piquant and so refined! I can't help fancying she is studying me
under her eyelashes. She has remarkably bright eyes. Can she
be interested in me? does she expect me to talk to her 1 There are
only she and I—but no, just now I would rather be alone with my
thoughts. This MAISIE MULL whom I shall meet so soon; what
is she like, I wonder? I presume she is unmarried. If I may judge
from her artless little letter, she is young and enthusiastic, and she
is a passionate admirer of my verse; she is longing to meet me. I
suppose some men's vanity would be flattered by a tribute like that.
I tnink I must have none; for it leaves me strangely cold. I did not
even reply; it struck me that it would be difficult to do so with anv
dignity, and she didn't tell me where to write to. ... After all,
how do I know that this will not end—like everything else—in dis-
illusion? Will not such crude girlish adoration pall upon me in
time? If she were exceptionally lovely; or say, even as charming
as this fair fellow-passenger of mine—why then, to be sure—but no,
something warns me that that is not to be. I snail find her plain,
sandy, freckled; she will render me ridiculous by her undiseriminat-
ing gush. . . . Yes, I feel my heart sink more and more at the
prospect of this visit. Ah me! [He nighs heavily,

solitary. And true sympathy is so rare, so refreshing. I—I fear
such an appeal from 'a stranger may seem a little startling; it is
true that hitherto we have only exchanged a very few sentences;
and yet already I feel that we have something—much—in common.
You can't be so cruel as to let all intimacy cease here—it is quite
tantalising enough that it must end so soon. A very few more
minutes, and this brief episode will be only a memory; I shall have
left the little green oasis far behind me, and be facing the dreary
desert once more—alone!
His Fellow P. (laughing). Well, of all the uncomplimentary
things! As it happens, though, "the little green oasis "—as you 're

[" It is impracticable to proceed in the present
Session with some of the great measures to which
the Government is pledged, such, for example, as
that relating to the Church in Wales, the Regis-
tration Bill, and the Local Veto Bill."—Sir William
Raranirt.
Little Local Veto, loquitur :—
OH, exactly! Just what I expected! And
after such volumes of talk!
My prospects you told me were brilliant, and
here it all ends—in a baulk!
0, won't I just work up Sir WILFRID, and
won't I just wake Mister CAINE?
But there, you can't trust anybody, these
times, that's exceedingly plain.
And you too, my own bringer-up, to turn me
out of house and of home!
Oho, you unnatural parent! And where shall
we wanderers roam—
Poor Taffy, and young (Registration) Bill—
look at him limping !—and Me?
And the other ones tucked up inside, and
especially that impudent Three,
The Irish, the Scotch, and the London boys,
whom you so favour and pet,
Are laughing at us from the window. Bat,
drat them, their turn may come yet.
They may have to turnout, after all! BILLY
BUDGET of course is all right,
For you fought for your favourite che-ild,
and, by Jingo, it hat been a fight!
But what have / done to be rounded on?
Call yourself boss of the place?
Why. the BABTLEYS, and BOWLESES, and
BOLTOITS and BYRNES simply laugh in
your face!
What use to be landlord at all if you can't
choose your tenants? Oh my!
That odious Bang-^-one more Bl—has the
But I icon't. I will kick! I 'm not
meek, like those other two poor little
BILLS;
Look, how limp and dejected they go, though
against their poor dear little wills!
But I am not going to be put upon. I '11
make it awkward all round.
You won't treat me so any more; you won't
"chuck" me again, I'll be bound.
And what Compensation have I, for Disturb-
ance? Eh! what's that you say?
"All right?" — " Reinstatement — next
year ?"—" Pass away, my dears, please,
pass away ?"—
Ah! it's all very fine to look pleasant and
promise fair things—at the door;
But that's regular constable blarney, old boy,
and you 've done it before.'
Meanwhile we're Evicted, worse luck! like
the poor Irish Tenants whose case
Those busy B's muster to fight over. Ah!
you put on a bold face,
But ice ain't the only Pill Garlics! No; some
of 'em still left inside
Will yet join us, out in the cold, as will

THE COLONEL AND THE QUIVER.—Our own
Colonel SAUNDERSON, M.P., was never better
at his best than when, in the debate last
Thursday night, he said, "If the Bill passes,
a quiver of norror will run through every
tenant, &c., &c." Of course the gallant
Colonel meant "arrow" or "dart," not
"quiver." A dart or an arrow will run
through a person, piercing him in front, and
reappearing at back. But "quiver" doesn't
do this sort of thing. An arrow so transfix-
ing a body may make it quiver—but this is
another matter. More power to the quivering

THE COPPERATION AT WINSEE.
OH, didn't the grand old Copperation have a grand treat last week
at Winser! Her grashus Majesty the QUEEN asked 'em all down to her
butiful Pallace to hear the soBem Recorder read to her their joyful
feelings at the birth of her dear little Great Grand Son! And then,
to the great joy of all on 'em, Her MAJESTY read such a delishus
arnser as amost brort tears to the eyes of some of the young uns of
the Party, and sent 'em away to the Dutiful Lunshon Room to refresh
exhorsted natur with a delicate Lunch, and sum exkisit Madeary, such
as King GEORGE THE FOURTH is said to have saved xpressly for
simmilar glorius ocasions.
Don't let it be supposed as I wants peeple to beleeve as I was
there; but I had the hole account given by one as was, and I ain't
ixagerated it not a bit.
There is a sertain Body of gents in London as ewidentlv wonts to
play fust fiddel in the guvernment of our grand old City, but I
havent heard of their being asked down to Winser Carsel to con-
gratulate her Most Gravsnus MAOESTY on the late appy ewent.
Should they be so I should most suttenly make a pint of seeing 'em
all start, if it were only out of curiosity to see what sort of State
Mazerine Gownds they would all wear!
I had allmost forgot to menshun that the two Sherryffs, and the
Chairman of the big Tower Bridge, was all benighted, and came out
of the presents Chamber smiling like ancient Cherubs. I am told as
how as the Copperation was so werry much delited with their royal
wisit to royal Winser, that they has been and passed a werry similer
wote of thanks to the Dook and Dutchess of YORK, and arsked them
to receeve 'em jest the same as the QUEEN did, hut they is both werry
sorry to say, that their Pallis not being near so big as Her MAJESTY'S,
they hopes as only a small Deppytation of Aldermen and C. C.'s will
attend.
Oh won't there be jest a rush for places, as every one on 'em is
naterally anxious to show his loyelty on so hinteresting an ocasion,
tho of course they carnt expec to have heverything exacly the same
OPERA NOTES.
Tuesday, July 17.—"The opera season will terminate July 30."
To-night VERDI'S opera of A'ida, "with the dotlets on the i." First
appearance of Madame ADINI, a spacious prima donna who amply
fills the part. GIULIA RAVOGLI an excellent Amneris. Opera
apparently not particularly attractive, or more powerful attractions
elsewhere.
Saturday, 21.—Pagliacci followed by new opera entitled The
Lady of Longford, though it would have been more polite had the
Pagliacci allowed the Lady to precede them. But Pagliacci will be
Pagliacci. The Lady's Librettists are Sir DHUBIOLANUS POETICUS
and Mr. F. E. WEATHEHLY. The music is by EMIL BACH. The
Gentlemen of Longford are represented by Messrs. ALVAREZ and
EDOUARD BE RESZKE, while the Lady, the big lady, is EMMA EAMES
—" quite the lady "—and the little lady is EVELYN HUGHES. This
new Lady turns out to be our old friend the one-act drama by
TOM TAYLOR entitled A Sheep in Wolfs Clothing, set to music, the
comic characters being omitted, and the end made tragic instead of
happy. The music does not entitle BACH to take a front seat.
EMMA EAMES excellent; FANBY HUGHES funny; ALVAREZ good;
JEAN DE REKZKE first-rate all-round-head Colonel, but more Eke a
Cathedral than a Kirk. Composer and Librettists complimented;
MANCINELLI conducted; house full. General satisfaction.
HARD CASE OF "EVICTED TENANTS" IN DRUBT LANE.—At a
general assembly of the Theatre Royal Drury Lane Company of Pro-
prietors last Wednesday, Mr. CHITTY is reported to have observed that
"after putting £300,000 into the building without receiving a farthing
in return, they were now to have their money confiscated by the law,
but in such circumstances as one would not have expected from a
nobleman in the Duke of BEDFORD'S position." Ahem! Why did
not Sir DRURIOLANUS arise and, remembering the Barber of Seville,
sing "CHITTY, CHITTY, piano!piano!" But naturally the Drury

THE "GRAND NATIONAL"
TRUST.
A MEETING has recently
taken place at Qrosyenor
House to establish a National
Trust, the idea being to pre-
serve places of historic in-
terest and natural beauty.
Announced at the meeting
that already a beautiful cliff
had been promised by a lady.
We understand the following
promises have also been re-
ceived :—
The Duke of W-stm-n-
st-r. — A very handsome
ground-rent. Intended to
support and sustain beauti-
ful cliffs, &c.
The Duke of D-v-nih-re.
—Ch-tsw-rth, which, owing
to recent legislation, he can
no longer afford to keep up.
Intends to take a small cot-
tage, it is believtd, at some
inexpensive town on the
East Coast. Several Dis-
tressed Dukes have also pro-
mised, on their death, to
leave their estates to the
Trust.
A_ Lover of Ozone. — A
particularly bracing breeze.
To be dedicated to the public
for ever.
The London County Coun-
cil—The Shaf tesbury Foun-
tain. The L. C. C., we
understand, welcomes the
prospo t of handing over to
the Trust the responsibility
attaching to this insoluble
problem.
A Hertfordshire Oentle-
nian.—A thoroughly reliable
right of way.
Mr. Th-m-i B-ch-m.—
A unique collection of sign-
boards in tilu. These are
placed in the midst of the
most lovely natural scenery,
and in themselves will very
soon, it is hoped, be of his-
toric interest.
-Sir Fr-d-r-c k P-ll-ck will
arrange in every case to
supply a good title.
Mr. Punch heartily com-
mends so patriotic a scheme
to his readers. Any beauti-
ful cliffs, ground-rents, rights
of way, &o., sent to him at
85, Fleet Street will imme-
diately be forwarded to the
proper quarter. N.B.—It is
just possible an exception to
this rule might be made in
the case of ground-rents.
HOW IT IS DONE.
(An Art-Kecipe.)

TAKE a lot of black triangles,
Some amorphous blobs of red;
Just a sprinkle of queer spangles.
An ill-drawn Medusa head;
Some red locks in Gorgon tangles.
And a scarlet sunshade, spread:
Take a "portiere" quaint and spotty,
Take a turn-up nose or two;
The loose lips of one " gone dotty,"
A cheese-cutter chin, askew;
Poee like that of front-row " TOTTIE,"
Hut as worn by " Coster Loo ";
Take an hour-glass waist, in section,
Shoulders hunched up camel-wise;
1 .Give a look of introspection
(Or a squint) to two black eyes;
Or a glance of quaint dejection,
Or a glare of wild surprise;
Slab and slop them all together
With a background of sheer
sludge;
(Like a slum in foggy weather).
And this blend of scrawl and
smudge
\"end as ART—in highest feather !—
Dupes in praise will blare and blether.
Honest Burchellt will cry —
"FDDGE!!!"
A Demi-French Octave.
(Pifked up in a Dressing-room.')
MY razor, you 're a true
raseur,
_ That is. you bore me badly!
You 're blunt, you gash—tie

I bless you wildly, mudlv!

tn horreur
Each morn on rising sadly;
Were 't not that shaving's
de rigueur,
In turn I 'd cut you gladly!
IN VIEW OF H9LIDAYS.
A HINT.—Of course if you're
on pedestrian tours bent—if
you're a bicyclist you'll be
still more bent—you cannot
do better than, as a pedes-
trian, get WALKER'S Maps.
If you are going to sail,
or by steam, you are again
referred to "WALKER.
London." There is a good
idea in these Maps which
might be still further deve-
loped, and that is not only to
show the route and the
manner of making your
journey, but by arrange-
ment with the principal
Steam - boat and Railway
Companies some sort of
"itinerary" might be added
to the Map, with informa-
tion as to the "means
whereby," which to the
toiler in search of a brief
holiday "by rail, by river,
or by sea," and perhaps by
all three, would be most
useful were it available as
an almost "instantaneous
process " of reference.
BISLEY.

THE COPPERATION AT WINSER.
OH, didn't the grand old Copperation have a grand treat last week
at Winser! Her grashus Majesty the QUEEN asked 'em all down to her
butiful Pallace to hear the sollem Recorder read to her their joyful
feelings at the birth of her dear little Great Grand Son! And then,
to the great joy of all on "em, Her MAJESTY read such a delishus
arnser as amost brort tears to the eyes of some of the young uns of
the Party, and sent 'em away to the butiful Lunshon Room to refresh
exhorsted natur with a delicate Lunch, and sum exkisit Madeary, such
as King GEORGE THE FOUKTH is said to have saved xpressly for
si in mi I ;ir glorius ocasions.
Don't let it be supposed as I wants peeple to beleeve as I was
there; but I had the hole account given by one as was, and I ain't
ixagerated it not a bit.
There is a certain Body of gents in London as ewidently wonts to
play fust lidilrl in the guvernment of our grand old City, but I
havent heard of their being asked down to Winser Carsel to con-
gratulate her Most Gravshus MAGESTY on the late appy ewent.
Should they be so I should most suttenly make a pint of seeing 'em
all start, if it were only out of curiosity to see what sort of State
Mazerine Gownds they would all wear!
I had allmost forgot to menshun that the two Sherryffs, and the
Chairman of the big Tower Bridge, was all benighted, and came out
of the presents Chamber smiling like ancient Cherubs. I am told as
how as the Copperation was BO werry much delited with their royal
wisit to royal Winser, that they has been and passed a werry similer
wote of thanks to the Dock and Dutohess of YORK, and arsked them
to receeve 'em jest the same as the QUEEN did, but they is both werry
sorry to say, that their Pallis not being near so big as Her MAJESTY'S,
they hopes as only a small Deppytation of Aldermen and C. C.'s will
attend.
Oh won't there be jest a rush for places, as every one on 'em is
naterally anxious to show his loyelty on so hinteresting an ocasion,
tho of course they camt expeo to have heverything exacly the same
OPERA NOTES.
Tuesday. July 17.—"The ooera season will terminate July 30."
To-night VERDI'S opera of A'ida, "with the dotlets on the i." First
appearance of Madame ADINI, a spacious prima donna who amply
fills the part. GIULIA RAVOOLI an excellent Amneris. Opera
apparently not particularly attractive, or more powerful attractions
elsewhere.
Saturday, 1\.—Pagliacci followed by new opera entitled The
Lady of Longford, though it would have been more polite had the
Pagiiacci allowed the Lady to precede them. But Pagliacci will be
Pagliacci. The Lady's Librettists are Sir DHUBIOLANUS POETICUS
and Mr. F. E. WEATHEHLY. The music is by EMIL BACH. The
Gentlemen of Longford are represented by Messrs. ALVAREZ and
EDOUARD DE RESZKE, while the Lady, the big lady, is EMMA EAMF.S
—" quite the lady "—and the little lady is EVELYN HUGHES. This
new Lady turns out to be our old friend the one-act drama by
TOM TAYLOR entitled A Sheep in Wolfs Clothing, set to music, the
comic characters being omitted, and the end made tragic instead of
happy. The music does not entitle BACH to take a front seat.
EMMA EAMES excellent; FANNY HUGHES funny; ALVAREZ good;
JEAN DE RESZKE first-rate all-round-head Colonel, but more like a
Cathedral than a Kirk. Composer and Librettists complimented;
MAXCINELLI conducted; house full. General satisfaction.
HARD CASE OF "EVICTED TENANTS" IN DRURT LANE.—At a
general assembly of the Theatre Royal Drury Lane Company of Pro-
prietors last Wednesday, Mr. CHITTY is reported to have observed that
"after putting £300,000 into the building without receiving a farthing
in return, they were now to have their money confiscated by the law,
but in such circumstances as one would not have expected from a
nobleman in the Duke of BEDFORD'S position." Ahem! Why did
not Sir DRURIOLANTJS arise and, remembering the Barber of Seville,
sing "CHITTY, CHITTY, piano! piano!" But naturally the Drury

THE "GRAND NATIONAL"
TRUST.
A MEETING has recently
taken place at Grosvenor
House to establish a National
Trust, the idea being to pre-
serve places of historic in-
terest and natural beauty.
Announced at the meetin?
that already a beautiful cliff
had been promised by a lady.
Wi> understand the following
promises have also been re-
ceived :—
The Duk« of W-ttm-n-
st-r. — A very handsome
ground-rent. Intended to
support and sustain beauti-
ful cliffs, &c.
The Duke of D-v-nsh-re.
—Ch-tsw-rth, which, owing
to recent legislation, he can
no longer afford to keep up.
Intends to take a small cot-
tage, it is believed, at some
inexpensive town on the
East Coast. Several Dis-
tressed Dukes have also pro-
mised, on their death, to
leave their estates to the
Trust.
Af Lover of Ozone. — A
particularly bracing breeze.
To be dedicated to the public
for ever.
The London County Coun-
cil.—The Shaf tesbury Foun-
tain. The L. C. C., we
understand, welcomes the
prospei t of handing over to
the Trust the responsibility
attaching to this insoluble
problem.
A Hertfordthire Gentle-
man.—A thoroughly reliable
right of way.
Mr. Th-m-s B-ch-m.—
A unique collection of sign-
boards in titu. These are
placed in the midst of ihe
most lovely natural scenery,
and in themselves will very
soon, it U hoped, be of his-
toric interest.
Sir Fr-d-r-c k P-ll-ck will
arrange in every case to
supply a good title.
Mr. Punch heartily com-
mends so patriotic a scheme
to his readers. Any beauti-
ful cliffs, ground-rents, rights
of way, &c., sent to him at
85, Fleet Street will imme-
diately be forwarded to the
proper quarter. N.B.—It is
just possible an exception to
this rule might be made in
the case of ground-rents.
HOW IT IS DONE.
(An Art-Recipe.)

TAKE a lot of black triangles,
Some amorphous blobs of red;
Just a sprinkle of queer spangles,
An ill-drawn Medusa head;
Some red locks in Gorgon tangles,
And a scarlet sunshade, spread:
Take a "portiere" quaint and spotty,
Take a turn-up nose or two;
The loose lips of one " gone dotty,"
A cheese-cutter chin, askew;
Pose like that of front-row " TOTTIE,"
Hat as worn by " Coster Loo ";
Take an hour-glass waist, in section,
Shoulders hunched up camel-wise;
.Give a look of introspection
(Or a squint) to two black eyes;
Or a glance of quaint dejection,
Or a glare of wild surprise;
Slab and slop them all together
With a background of sheer
sludge;
(Like a slum in foggy weather),
And this blend of scrawl and
smudge
Vend as ART—in highest feather !—
Dupes in praise will blare and blether.
Honest Burchells -will cry —
"FUDGE!!!"
A Demi-French Octave.
(Picked tip in a Dressing-room.)
Mr razor, you 're a true
rcmeur,
That is, you bore me badly!
You 're blunt, you gash—de
tout mon creiir
I bless you wildly, madlv!
I'raiment, c'est rous qu' jfai
m horreur
Each morn on rising sadly:
Were 't not that shaving's
de rigueitr,
In turn I'd cut you gladly!
IN VIEW OF HOLIDAYS.
A HINT.—Of course if you're
on pedestrian tours bent—if
you're a bicyclist you'll be
still more bent—you cannot
do better than, as a pedes-
trian, get WALKER'S Maps.
If you are going to sail,
or by steam, you are again
referred to "WALKEH.
London." There is a good
idea in these Maps which
might be still further deve-
loped, and that is not only to
show the route and the
manner of making your
journey, but by arrange-
ment with the principal
Steam - boat and Railway
Companies some sort of
itinerary" might be added
to the Map, with informa-
tion as to the "means
whereby," which to the
toiler in search of a brief
holiday "by rail, by river,
or by sea," and perhaps by
all three, would be most
useful were it available as
an almost "instantaneous
process" of reference.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, July 16.—The Blameless
you know; helps WOODALL in getting his clothing vote; and, I
believe, is rather liked by Tommy Atkins."
Business done,—SQUIBE OF MALWOOD announces programme for
remainder of Session. A mere nothing. Only, as PEINCE ABTHUB
, ,, ., „. B. is ; says, in view of number of Bills and their contentious character, more
translated into the Breathless BABTLEY. Of eleven pages of Amend- like what we are accustomed to at beginning of Session, than to have
ments to Budget Bill standing for consideration when House met, dumped down in what should be its last month,
to-day^ not less than three contributed by this particular B. | Thursday.—" JOSEPH," said the Member for BARK, dropping into
one of his tiresome didactic moods, "would do well in any circum-
stances. Whether in Upper Egypt or Lower, he was sure to come to

Embodied readjusted ecale of graduated taxation. Only objections
to it presently stated by SQUIBE OF MALWOOD: (1) It would
necessitate total reconstruction of Bill (2) resulting in loss of
£643,000; (3) whole question had been thoroughly threshed out in
Committee. To raise it again at eleventh hour seemed too much to
ask even in connection with Budget Bill.
Nevertheless BABTLEY. not yet breathless, moved his multi-
tudinous Amendment. Resumed his seat with consciousness of man
who had done his duty. The SQUIRE would get up to answer him;
debate would follow; at least two hours would he pleasantly
occupied. Instead of SQUIRE, ATTOBNEY- GENERAL rose. "Well,"
said BLAMELESS, throwing himself into attitude of attention,
"let's hear what he has to say."
Turned out to be exceedingly little. "Government scale has been
attacked and defended many times," said ATTOBNEY-GENERAL. "I
do not think it necessary to defend it again; but," here he leaned
on the table with engaging look at the now BREATHLESS BAHTLEY,
"the hon. gentleman can take a division if he thinks fit."
BARTLEY sat and audibly gasped. JOKIM gal-
lantly protested against this treatment of his hon.
friend; threatened to move adjournment of debate.
PRINCE ARTHUR sent for; arrived almost as breath-
less as BARTLEY; thunder boomed, lightning
flashed round head of ATTORNEY-GENERAL, who is
always finding himself astonished. "The hon.
and learned gentleman," said PEIKCE ARTHUR,
with delightful assumption of anger, "has abused
the situation. The Opposition have no means of
compelling him to talk sense, but talk he must."
SQUIRE OF MALWOOD, who had fled before pros-
pect of long speech from BAHTLEY, hastily brought
back. Don't know where incident would have
ended had it not been for KEN YON- SLANBY. Find-
ing opening he slipped in. Threw himself into
easy oratorical attitude; proposed to consider prin-
ciple of graduation adopted in Bill. Would do so
under three heads: injustice to the poor, injustice
to the middle-class, injustice to the nch.
This too much even for Opposition. With
groans of despair they rushed into Division Lobby;
BABTLEY'S scheme negatived by majority of 62.
Business done.—Budget Bill passed Report
stage.
Wednesday,—ST. JOHN BRODKICK sitting on
front Opposition Bench through Committee of
Supply on Army Estimates this afternoon, in-
vested neighbourhood with unwonted air of fashion.
Not that there is. as a rule, any lack of style on
part of Leaders of Opposition regarded as a body.

the top of the well, however securely his brethren might have packed
him in its lowest depths. But, regarding him just now as he criti-
cised the SQUIRE'S arrangements for the Session, I could not help
thinking what a loss the auction-room has only partially survived
by his turn into the field of politics. If in early life, or even
middle age, he had only taken to the rostrum, the shade of the much
over-rated ROBINS would have been dimmed in glory. Observe how
well he looks the part. See with what unconscious effect he produces
a stumpy piece of lead pencil, and looks round for bids. Listen to
the clear sharp notes of his voice. 'What shall we say, gentlemen,
for the Equalisation of Rates Bill? How many days will you give
for it? Name your own time, gentlemen. There is no reserve. Shall
we say six days? Does the tall, somewhat stout gentleman with a
white waistcoat, on the Treasury Bench, shake his head? Very well,
we will say four days. Going at four days;' and the pencil,
scratching out six, substitutes four. This may seem very easy
when it's done; but it's art, TOBY, even genius.
If you think it's easy for a man discussing State
business, suddenly but completely to invest the
high court of Parliament with the tone and atmo-
sphere of an auction-room, just reckon up how
many other men of first rank in public life could
do it. Not to go further afield, could PRINCE
ARTHUR manage it, even after a week's training?
Very well; then don't minimise a successful effort
because, thanks to the commanding influence of
native talent, its accomplishment teems easy to a
particular person." Business dune. — HICKS-
BEACH, complaining that Ministers have dropped
a large number of Bills for lack of time^ to pass
them, and asserting .that the time remaining at
their disposal for passing the poor balance is too
short, reauces it by three hours, in order that he
and his friends may lament the fact.
Friday.—House heard with keen satisfaction
that SZLUMPEB is around again. Not having seen
in the newspapers any telegrams from him lately,
there was vague idea that he had succumbed to
his exertions on occasion of the happy event at
White Lodge. Perhaps he was a little fatigued, for
SZLUMPEB, in addition to being Mayor of Rich-
mond, is almost human. No man born of woman
could with impunity fire off such a succession rf
telegrams as on that memorable day SZLUMPEB
dealt out to his Sovereign, the Heir Apparent to
the Throne, the Crowned Heads of Europe, and
his ducal neighbours at the White Lodge. But on Royal Christen-

That token of the season sere,
To the unthinking fair so cheaply dear,
Who, like to shipwreck'd seamen, do it hail,
And cry, "A Sale! a Sale!
A Sale! a Summer Sale of Surplus Stock!"
See, how, like busy-humming bees
Around the ineffable fragrance of the lime,
Woman, unsparing of the salesman's time,
Reviews the stock, and chaffers at her case,
Nor yet, for all her talking, purchases,
But takes away, with copper-bulged purse,
The textile harvest of a quiet eye,
Great bargains still unbought, and power to
buy.
Or she, her daylong, garrulous labour d me,
Some victory o'er reluctant remnants won,
Fresh from the trophies of her skill,
Things that she needed not, nor ever will,
She takes the well-earned bun;
Ambrosial food, DEMETEB. erst design'd
As the appropriate food of womankind,
Plain, or with comfits deck'd and spice;
Or, daintier, dallies with an ice.
Xor feels in heart the worse
Because the haberdashers thus disperse
Thtir surplus stock at an astounding sacrifice!
Yet Contemplation pauses to review
The destinies that meet the silkworm's care,
The fate of fabrics whose materials grew
In the same fields of cotton or of flax,

And the fame mill, loom, cose, em]xjriuu>,

(For Use in Rotten Raw.)
Question. What part of London do you consider the most dan-
gerous for an equestrian P
Answer. That part of the Park known as Rotten Row.
Q. Why is it so dangerous'?
A. Because it is overcrowded in the Season, and at all times im-
perfectly kept.
Q. What do you mean by " imperfectly kept"?
A. I mean that the soil is not free from bricks and other impedi-
ments to comfortable and tafe riding.
Q. Why do you go to RotUn Row?
A. Became it is the moat convenient place in London fi/r the resi-
dents of the West End.
Q. But would not Battersea Park do as well?
A. It is farther afield, and at present, so far as the rides are con-
cerned, given over to the charms of solitude.
Q. And is not the Regent's Park also available f»r equestrians?
A: To some extent: but the roads in that rather distant pleasaunce
are not comparable for a moment with the ride within view of the

Q. Would a ride in Kensington Gardens be an advantage P
A. Yes, to some extent; still it would scarcely be as convenient
as the present exercising ground.
Q. Then you admit that there are (and might be) pleasant rides

A. Certainly; but that fact does not dispense with the necessity of
reform in existing institutions.
Q. Then you consider the raising of other issues is merely a plan to
confuse and obliterate the original contention Y
A. Assuredly; and it is a policy that has been tried before with
success to obstructed and failure to the grievance-mongers.
Q. So as two blacks do not make one white you and all believe that
Rotten Row should be carefully inspected and the causes of the recent
accidents ascertained and remedied?

for the benefit of the public in general and riders in Rotten Row in
"PERSONALLY CONDUCTED."

(For Use in Rotten Rwe.)
Question. What part of Ix>ndon do you consider the most dan-
gerous for an equestrian?
Answer. That part of the Park known as Rotten Row.
Q. Why is it so dangerous?
A. Because it is overcrowded in the Season, and at all times im-
perfectly kept.
Q. What do you mean by " imperfectly kept"?
A. I mean that the soil is not free from bricks and other impedi-
ments to comfortable and tafe riding:.
Q. Why do you go to Rotttn Row?
A. Becaufe it is the moat convenient place in London for the resi-
dents of the West End.
Q. But would not Battcrsea Park do as well r1
A. It is farther afield, and at present, so far as the rides are con-
cerned, given over to the charms of solitude.
Q. And is not the Regent's Park also available f»r equestrians P

but, in speaking to Mamma or me, it isn't at all necessary to say
'my ladv' or ' your ladyship.' I—I mean, it sounds rather, well—

Lady Maisie (more nervously still). It's reafiy such a trine, but—
but, in speaking to Mamma or me, it isn't at all necessary to say
'my ladv' or ' your ladyship." I—I mean, it sounds rather, well—
formal, don't you know!
Spurr. (to himself). She's going to be chummy now! (Aloud.) I
thought, on a first acquaintance, it was onlv manners.
Lady Maisie. Oh—manners? yes, I—t daresay—but still—but
still—not at Wyvern, don't you know. If you like, you can call
Mamma ' I-ady CANTIHK,' ana me ' Lady MAISIE,' and, of course, my
Aunt will be 'Lady CUI.VERIN,' but—but if there are other people
staying in the house, you needn't call them anything, do you see?
Spurr. (to himself). 1 'in not likely to have the chance! (Aloud.)
Well, if you're sure they won't mind it, because I'm not used to
this sort of thing, so I put myself in your hands,—for, of course, you
know what brought me down here?
Lady Muisie (to herself). He means my foolish letter! Oh, I
must put a stop to that at once! (In n hurried undertone.) Yes—
yes; I—I think I do. I mean, I do know—but—but please forget
it—indeed you must!
Npurr. (in himself). Forget I've come down as a vet'( The CPL-
VERiJis will take cure I don't forget that! (Aloud.) But, I say, it's

tlmi't speak so loud! Mamma might hear!

yout Mother knew!
Oh, how dense he is! (Aland.) Yes—yes—of cnurse she knows —
butr—but you might tcake her! And—and please don't allude to it
again—to me or—or anyone. (To herself.) That I should have to
beg him to be silent like this! But what can I </»? Goodness only
knows what he mightn't say, if I don't warn him!
Spurr. (nettled). I don't mind who knows. I'm not ashamed of
it, Lady MAISIE—whatever you may be!
Lady Maisie (to herself, exasperated). He dares to imply that 7've
done something to be ashamed of! (Aloud; haughtily.) I'm not
ashamed—why should 1 be? Only-^-oh, can't you really understand
that—that one may do things which one wouldn't care to be re-
minded of publicly i* I don't wish it —isn't that enough?
Spurr. (to himself). I see what she's at now—doesn't want it to
come out that she's travelled down here with a vet! (Aloud,
stiffly-) A lady's wish is enough for me at any time. If you 're
sorry for having gone out of your way to be friendly, why, I m not
the person to take advantage of it. I hope I know how to behave.

Lady Maisie (to her self). Why did I say anything at all! I've only
made things worse—I 've let him see that he has an advantage.
And he's certain to use it sooner or later—unless I am civil to him.
I 've offended him now—and I shall have to make it up with him!
Spurr. (to himself). I thought all along she didn't seem as
chummy as her mother—but to turn round on me like this!
Lady Cant, (waking up). Well, Mr. ANDROMEDA, I should have
thought you and my daughter might have found some subject in
common; but I haven't heard a word from either of you since we
left the station.
Lady Maisie (to herself). That's some comfort! (Aloud.) You
must have had a nap, Mamma. We—we hare been talking.

DREAM BOOK.
(Compiled by our Pet Pessimist.)
IF you imagine that it will
be fine, and consequently that
you can don the lightest of
attire, you may he sure that it
will be cold and wet, and ab-
solutely unsuitable to travel-
ling:.
If you fancy that you will
enjoy a delightful visit to some
intimate friends, you will (ind
that you have had yourjourney
to a spot "ten miles from any-
where" for nothing, as your
intended hosts have gone
abroad for the season.
If you believe that you are
seeing a favourite piece being
played admirably at a West
End theatre, you will discover
that the programme was altered
four days ago, and that the
temple of the drama will not
reopen until the autumn.
_If you arrange to go abroad
with a friend, you will quarrel
with your acquaintance on the
following morning, and dis-
arrange your plans for a life-
time.
Lastly, if you dream that
you have decided to give up
gadding about on a bank holi-
day to remain at home, you will
see that it is better to follow
your fancy, and avoid the risk
of making a mistake by adven-
turing to strange places and
pastures new.

but deadly to the gout-ridden toes of the home-faring Alderman,
now sinking to a fall, now impetuously whirled on a devil-dance,
clamorous as Cocytus, the lost souls filling it to the brink, at last the
meaning glimmered to the eye—not that wherein dead time hung
just above the underlids, but the common reading eye a-thirst for
meanings, baffled again and again and drooping a soimritic lid slowly,
nose a-snore. and indolent mind lapped in slumber. 'Ihey discussed \*.

deep in the compound, and no distinction.

scattering apish hop-poles like a parachute blown into space by the

showed command, hor bonnet puckered to the front, a fat aunt
trailing behind. They came steadily. It was AMLNTA with her aunt.
Lord ORMUXT, his temper ablaze like his manuscript, thirty-four
pages, neither more nor less, fortifications planned, advice given
gratis to the loutish neglecting nation, stepped forward.
"You must remove her," he declared to WEYBURN.
"But the aunt?" questioned MATEY.
"She must go too. See to it quickly!" He fell back, the irre-
vocable quivering in his eveball, destiny mocking with careless glee,
while MoRSFraLD and a bully-captain saw their chances and just
missed the taking.

Caddie. "EH, MON, THERE 's MORE SWEARING USED OVER GOLF THAN ANY OTHER GAME! D'YE NO CA' THAT EXCITEMENT 1"
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Souse of Commons, Monday. July 23.—Quite like old times to
hear TIM HE ALT saying a few plain things about landlords; PRINCE
ARTHUR replying; TIM growling out occasional contradiction; whilst
O'BfilEN hotly interrupts. To make the reminiscence complete JOSEPH
contributes a speech in which he heaps contumely and scorn on
representatives of Irish nationality. TIM reminds him how different
was his attitude, how varied his voice, at epoch of Kilmainham Treaty.
TIH has a rough but effective way of fastening upon a name
or phrase, and even blatantly reiterating it. Thus, when OLD
MORALITY, in his kindly manner, once alluded to a visit paid to him
at a critical time by his "old friend Mr. WALTER," TIM leaped
down upon it, and, characteristically leaving out the customary
appellation, filled the air with scornful reference to "my old friend
WALTER." To-night, desiring to bring into sharp contrast JOSEPH'S
present attitude towards Ireland and the landlord party with that
assumed by him twelve years ago, he insisted upon calling the
Arrears Bill of 1882 "the Chamberlain Act." It wasn't JOSEPH'S
personal possession or invention any more than it was the SQUIRE OK j
MAI-WOOD'S. But that way of putting it doubly suited TIM'S pur-
pose. It permitted him, without breach of order, to allude by name
to the member for West Birmingham; there's a good deal in a name
when the syllables are hissed forth with infinite hate and scorn.
Also it accentuated the changed position ris-d-rii Ireland to which
further reflection and honest conviction have brought the prime
mover in the Kilmainham Treaty.
Irish Members, forgetting their own quarrels with TIM as he
fustigated the common enemy, roared with delight. A broad smile
lighted up the serried ranks of the Liberals. PRINCE AHTHCK wore
a decorous look of sympathy with his wronged right hon. friend.
The Duke of DEVONSHIRE,—" late the Leader of the Liberal Party,"
—from the Peers' Gallery surveyed the scene with stolid countenance.
JOSEPH, orchid-decked, sat in his corner seat below the gangway,
staring straight before him as one who saw not neither did he hear.
Business done.—TIM HEALY goes on the rampage. Evicted
Tuesday.—As has been noted on an earlier occasion, Britannia has
no bulwarks, no towers along her steep. It is, consequently, the
more comforting to know that ELLIS ASHMEAD-BABTLETT (Knight)
keeps his eye on things abroad as they affect the interests of British
citizens. The Member for SAKK tells me he has a faded copy of the
Skibbereen Eagle containing its famous note of warning to NAPOLEON
THE THIRD. Was published at time of the irruption of Colonels.
These gentlemen, sitting on boulevards sipping absinthe, used to
twirl their moustache and—sacrree!—growl hints of what they
would do when they as conquerors walked down Piccadillee, and
rioted in the riches of Leestar Square.
NAPOLEON THE THIRD did not escape suspicion of fanning 1his
flame. Howbeit the Skibbereen Eagle came out one Saturday
morning with a leading article commencing: "We have our eye on
NAPOLEON THE THIRD, Emperor of the French."
Thus ELLIS ASHMEAD-BARTLETT (Knight) digs eagle claws into
the aerie heights of the Clock Tower, and watches over the interests
and cares of an Empire on which the sun rarely sets.
"All the kinder of him," SARK says, "since they cannot be said
directly to concern him. In an effort to redress the balance between
the Old World and the New, United States has lent us ASHMEAD.
The temporary character of the arrangement makes only the more
generous his concern for the interests of the Empire in which he
lodges."
In the peculiar circumstances of the case those able young men,
EDWARD GREY and SYDNEY BUXTON, might be a little less openly
contemptuous in their treatment of the Patriotic Emigrant. Hard
to say at which office door. Foreign or Colonial, ASHMEAD bongs his
head with more distressful result. He takes them in succession, with
dogged courage that would in anyone else excite admiration. Of the
two janitors, perhaps EDVVARD GREY'S touch is the lightest. He
replies with a solemn gravity that puzzles ASHMEAD, and keeps him
brooding till SPEAKER stays the merry laughter of the House by
calling on the next question. BUXTON is more openly contemptuous,
more severely sarcastic, and sometimes, when ASHMEAD'S prattling,
of no consequence in the House, might possibly have serions effect
when cabled to the Transvaal where they think all Members of
Tenants Bill read second time.
Parliament are responsible men, he smartly raps out. Between the

time of it. Has long learned how much sharper than a serpent's
tooth is the tongue of an Under Secretary of State. Business done.
—Second Reading of Equalisation of London Hates Bill moved.
Thursday.—Lords took Budget Bill in hand to-night. MARKISS
asked for week's interval. This looked like fighting. At least there
would he a reconnaissance in force led by the MAHKISS. House full;
peerless Peeresses looked down from side gallery; MABKISS in his
place; DEVONSHIRE in his—not Chatsworth; that going to be shut
up; but corner seat below gangway; ROSBHERY hovering about,
settled down at length in seat of Leader. Clerk read Orders of the
Day. "Finance Bill second reading." "I move the Bill be read a
second time," said ROSEBERY, politely taking his hat off to lady in
gallery immediately opposite. Then he sat down.
Here was a pretty go! Expected PREMIER would make brilliant
speech in support of Bill; the MARXISS would reply; fireworks would
fizz all round, and, though perhaps Budget Bill might be saved,
SQUIHE OK MALWOOD would be pummelled. ROSEIIERY takes oddest,
most unparliamentary view of his duty. The Lords, he said, when
last week subject was mooted, have nothing to do with Budget Bill,
unless indeed they are prepared to throw it out. "Will you do
that?" he asked. "No," paid MARKTSS, looking as if he would
much rather say "Yes." "Very well then," said ROSEBERY, "all
speeches on the subject must be barren."
This to the Barons seemed lamentably personal.
ROSEBEET illustrated his point by declining for his own part to
make a speech. Still there was talk; barren speeches for three hours;
audience gradually dwindling: only a few left to witness spectacle of
HALSHDRV'S blue blood boiling over with indignation at sacrilegious
assault on landed aristocracy.
"If you want to make your flesh creep," says SARK, "you should
hear HALSIIUKY, raiting to full height his majestic figure, throwing
the shadow of his proudly aquiline profile fiercely on the steps of the
Throne where some minions of the Government cowered, exclaim,' My
Ix>rds, I detect in this Bill a hostile spirit towards the landed aristo-
cracy.'"
"A HALSBURY! a HALSBURY! " menacingly muttered FEVEBSHAM
and_ some other fiery crusaders.
For the moment, so deeply was the assembly slirred, a conflict
between the two Houses seemed imminent. But Black Rod coming
to take away the Mace the tumult subsided, and Lord HALSBVRY
went home in a four-wheeler.
Business done. — Budget read second time in Lords.
Friday.—Scene in Commons quite changed; properties remain but
leading characters altered. After unprecedented run, Budget Bill
withdrawn; Irish Evicted Tenants Bill now underlined on bills.
JOHN MORI.EY succeeds the SQUIRE; Irish Members take up the
buzzing of the no longer Busy B's.
As for the SQUIRE, he takes well-earned, though only comparative
rest; preparing for congratulatory feast spread for him next Wed-

OUR CHARITY FETE.
ELL, my dear Mr. Punch, you, who hear
everything, will be glad to receive from me
the particulars of our Annual Farewell Charity
Fete, given this year at the Grafton Gallery
for the excellent object of providing the un-
deserving with pink carnations. It was a
bazaar, a concert, and a fancy-dress ball, all
in one; everyone who is anyone was there,
and as they were all in costume, nobody could
tell who was who. It was indeed a very
brilliant scene.
I refused to hold a stall, for I had enough
T> • t« n to do writing out autographs of celebrities
i -; M BOX. -they gell lendidl )f but g wa? hard ^OTk<
and there was an absurd fuss just because I made the trifling mistake
of signing "Yours truly, GEORGE MEREDITH" across a photograph of
ARTHUR ROBERTS. What did it matter? I really cannot see that it
made the slightest difference; the person had asked for an autograph of
MEREDITH and he got it, and a portrait of ROBERTS into the bargain!
so he ought to have been satisfied; but some people are strangely
exacting! There was a great run on the autograph of SARAH BERN-
HAHDT and I grew quite tired of signing YVETTE, ROSEBEET, and
CISSIE LOFTTJS, however, it was all for the charity. I went as a
Perfect Gentleman, and it was quite a good disguise—hardly anyone
knew me! I saw SIR BRUCE SKENE dressed as a Temperance Lec-
turer; GRINGOIRE was there as the Enemy of the People with a
bunch of violets in his button-hole; the NEW BOY went as Becket,
and CHARLEY'S AUNT as the Yellow Aster. THE GENTLEMAN or
FRANCE looked well as The Prisoner of Zenda, I recognised our old
friend DORIAN GBAY in a gorgeous costume of purple and pearls, with
a crown on his head of crimson roses. He said he had come as a
Prose Pocin, and he was selling Prose Poem-granates for the good of
the charity.
Here are some scraps of conversation I overheard in the crowd:—
Enemy of the People (to Sir BRUCE SKENE). Been having a good
time lately 'f
Sir Bruce. Rather! Tremendous 1 I 've been doing nothing but
backing winners, and, what's more—(chuckling)—I've at last got
that astronomer fellow to take my wife and child off my hands.
Isn't that jolly?
Enemy of the People. Ah, really? She is coming to us in the
autumn, you know.
Virien-the Modern Eve (to the New Boy). I cannot stay here any
longer. They never dust the drawing-room, the geraniums are
planted all wrong, and I do not like the anti-macassars. Will you
come with me?
New Boy. What a lark it would be! But I 'm afraid I must stay
and look after my white mice. You see, BULLOCK MAJOR
Lady Belton (after her marriage, to Charley's Aunt, tearfully).
He doesn't understand me, Aunty.
Charley's Aunt. Never mind, my dear. Don't cry! You shall
come with me to Brazil; you've heard me mention, perhaps, it's the
pjace where the nuts come from; and we'll get up an amateur per-
formance of the Pantomime Itehearsal!
We had all sorts of amusements. Under a palm, a palmist was
prophesying long journeys, second marriages, and affairs of the
heart to the white hand of giggling incredulity. Beautiful
musicians, in blue uniforms, with gold Hungarian bands round their
waists, were discoursing the sweetest strain that ever encouraged the
conversation of the unmusical. A feature of the bazaar, that
I invented, was a mechanical Sphinx behind a curtain. They asked
it questions—chiefly, what would win the Leger—and put a penny
in the slot. There never was any answer, and that was the
great joke!
The whole thing was undoubtedly a wonderful success—and I knew
it would be. I believed in my Fete, having always been rather a
fatalist.
And, in the rush of a worldlv, frivolous existence, how great a
pleasure it is to think we should have aided—if ever so little—in
brightening the lives of the poor young fellows, kept, perhaps, all the
season through, in or near the hot pavement of Piccadilly, and with
not so much as a buttercup to remind them of the green fields, the
golden sunlight, the blue sky of the glorious country. To have
helped in so noble a cause as ours is a privilege that made us leave
the bazaar with tears of sympathy in our eyes, feeling better and
purer men and women. Long, long may the button-hole of improvi-
dence be tilled by the wired carnation of judicious charity.
Believe me, dear Mr. Punch,
Yours very truly, "JEMIMA THE PENWOMAN."
P.S.—An absurd name they gave me on account of the autograph
incident. You remember what " JIM THK PENMAN" was? Of course,
but there 's no chance of my becoming the PEN-" WIPER" in the

Und. I might—if I had any desire to make an unnecessary and
j insulting remark.
Phill. Insulting? Why, it's what I am! I 'm maid to Lady
1 MAISIE. I thought your mysterious instinct told you all about it?
Und. (to himself—after the first shock). A lady's maid! Gracious
j Heaven! What have I been saying—or rather, what haven't I?
! (Aloud.) To—to be sure it did. Of course, I quite understand that.

Phill. And, after all, you've never told me who you are. Who
are you?

SCENE X.—In a Fly.
Undershell (to himself). Alone with a lovely
girI7 who has no suspicion, as yet, that I am
the poet whose, songs have thrilled her with
admiration! Could any situation he more
romantic? I think I must keep up this little
mystification as long as possible.
Phillipson (to herself). I wonder who he
is. Somebody's Man, I suppose. I do be-
lieve he's struck with me. Well, I've no
objection. I don't see why I shouldn't forget
JIM now and then—he's quite forgotten me!
(Aloud.) They might have sent a decent
carriage for us instead of this ramshackle old
Biimmerhouse. We shall be hours getting to
the house at this rate!
Und. (gallantly). For my part, I care not
how long we may be. I feel so unspeakably
content to be where I am.

And I shouldn't call stuffiness enchantment myself.
Und. I'm not prepared to deny thy stuffiness. But cannot you
gness what has transformed this vehicle for me in spite of its un-
deniable shortcomings—<>r must I speak more plainly still?

•an almost fastidious shrinking from strangers
, Phill. (icith a little laugh). Really, I shouldn't have thought it!
| Und. Because, in the present case, I do not—I cannot—feel as if
we were strangers. Some mysterious instinct led me, almost from
'the first, to associate you with a certain Miss MAISIB MULL.
; Phill. Well, I wonder how you discovered that. Though you
shouldn't have said " Mi«s "—Lady MAISLE MULL is the name.
Und. (to hinitelf). Lady MAISIE MCLL! I attach no meaning to
•titles—and yet nothing but rank could confer such perfect ease and
distinction. (Afaud.) I should have said Lady MAISI n MULL, un-
doubtedly—forgive my ignorance But at least' I have divined you.
Phill. Oh, I knew thai. But you let out
just now you had to do with a Mews. You
aren't a rough-rider, are you?
Und. N —not exactly - not a rot/^A-rider.
(To himself.) Never on a horse in my life!
- unless I count my Pegasus. (Aloud.) But
you are right in supposing I am connected
with a muse—in one sense.
Phill. I said so, didn't I? Don't you think
it was rather clever of me to spot you, when
you 're not a bit horsey-looking?
Und. (with elaborate irony). Accept my
compliments on a power of penetration which
is simply phenomenal!
Phill. {giving him a little push). Oh, go
along—it's all talk with you -I don't believe
you mean a word you say!
Und. (to himself). She's becoming abso-
lutely vulgar. (Aloud.) I don't—I don't:
it's a manner I have; you mustn't attach
any importance to it—none whatever!
Phill. What! Not to all those high-flown
compliments? Do you mean to tell me you 're
only a gay deceiver, then?
Und. (in horror). Not a deceiver, no; and
decidedly not gay. I mean I did mean the
compliments, of course. (To himself.) I
mustn't let her suspect anything, or she '11
get talking about it; it would be too horrible
if this were to get round to Lady MAISIE or
the CULVERINB— so undignified; and it would
ruin all my prestige! I 'ye only to go on
playing a part for a few minutes, and—maid

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
"THERE are, methinks," quoth the Baron, " two or three novels
—one certainly I can cull to mind—wherein the interior domestic life
of Jews strict in the observance of their ancient and most touching
religious rites and ceremonies is more amply, as well as more
minutely, described than in Mr. FARJEOS'S Aaron the Jew, which, be
it my pleasing duty to testify, is one of the best of_ this prolific
author's works; a simple, touching story, the interest being wAl kept
up, as of course the " interest" should be when dealing with the true
history of one who commenced as a pawnbroker." As to the rites above
mentioned, no special or intimate personal experience is shown to be
possessed by the author, who could very eadly have obtained his
materials from an interesting work entitled, as I fancy, The Jew at
Home, which has, the Baron regrets to say, disappeared from its shelf
in the Baron's library. Aaron is lively, is gay, is witty, a "Jew
d1 esprit," and, like Mr. Peter Magnus, he amuses a small circle of
intimate friends; but his story, and that of his sweet wife Rachel, as
related bv Mr. FARJEON, will increase this friendly circle to a very
considerable extent. The Baron ventures to think that a good deal
of the dialogue and of the descriptive writing is unnecessary,—bat
Mr. FARJEOX likes to give everyone plenty for their money,—and,
further, that the story would have gained by the loss of what would
have reduced the three volumes to two. But altogether, the novel
is "recommended" by the interested but disinterested

regret. But if he were asked for a justification of

Order Book of the House of Commons."]
Gunner HAKCOUKT, loquitur:—
EXCEPTIONAL measures I hate,
I 'd rather not always be battling;
The good old " Brown Hess" I prefer, I
confess,
To fight in the old-fashioned way,
Good temperedly, fairly, politely,
Is more to my mind; hut these fellows, I find,
Will not let a. leader be knightly.
If BALFOTJR would only fight fair;
And impose that condition on BARTLEY;
If JOE would not ravage and shriek like a
Ravage;
Did TOMMY talk less, and less tartly;
Were GOSCHEN less eager for scalps,
And kept a tight rein upon HAKBURT;
Why then 'twere all right; we'd soon gtt
through our tight
But no, they 're like Soudanese blacks,
All fury and wild ugly rushes.
They shriek and they shock, and they hack
and they hock.
Till chivalry shudders and blushes.
And so the machine-gun, I find,
Is just the one thing will arrest 'em.
They 've quite lost their head, but a fair rain
of lead
Played on them will try 'em and test 'em!
Whir-r-r-r.' GEOHGE! how it's mowing
them down,
Their Advance - guard,—" Amendments"
they dub them!
They swarm thick and thicker. The handle
turns quicker!
'Tis dreadful; but then we must drub them.
As COURTNEY so gallantly said,
'Tis " deplorable"; troubles me sorely.
But if ARTHTJK and JOE won't make terms,
why, you know,
They really can't blame me and MOELEY!
AIRS RESUMPTIVE.
II.—THE LINKS OF LOVE.
MY heart is like a driver-club,
That heaves the pellet hard and straight,
That carries every let and rub.
The whole performance really great;
Mv heart is like a bulger-head,
That whiffles on the wily tee,—
Because my love distinctly said
She 'd halve the round of life with me.
My heart is also like a cleek,
.Resembling most the mashie sort,
That spanks the object, so to speak,
Across the sandy bar to port;
And hers is like a putting-green,
The haven where I boast to be,
For she assures me she is keen
To halve the round of life with me.
Some wear their hearts upon their sleeve,
And others lose 'em on the links;
(This play of words is, by your leave,
Rather original, one thinks;)
Therefore my heart is like to some
Lost ball that nestles on the lea,
Because my love has kindly come
To halve the round of life with me.
liaise me a bunker, if you can,
That beetles o'er a deadly ditch,
Where any but the bogey-man
Is practically bound to pitch;
Plant me beneath a hedge of thorn,
Or up a figurative tree,
What matter, when my love has sworn
To halve the round of life with me '<
THE YELLOW AGE.
THE poets sing of a Gjldon Age.
Are we trying to start its fellow?
The Yellow Aster js all the rage;
The Yellow Rices in war engage;
The Primrose League wild war doth wage,
And the much-boomed Book in cover and page
Like the Age itself is—Yellow.
Well, Yellow 'a the tint of Gold—and Brass!
Of the Golden Culf-and the Golden Ass I
Of the " livery " face and the faded leaf,
But 'tis tedious, very, beyond belief.
I own I am little inclined to smile
On the colour of age, decay, and bile
And mustard, and Othello;
['m tired, I own, of it's very look,
And I feel compelled to cock a snook
At the Yellow Primrose, the Yellow Book.
Though an Age iml id
That runs to seed
To a new (Parliamentary) Gatling.
Is like to run to Ytllow!
And hatrea in love's flowing can bury.

SATURDAY POPS.
NEW SERIES.
"ROTTICUS," who is clearly
"Rcsticcs EXPECTAN8," was
moved to write to the Chronicle
on July 31st, to say that,
though not a rich man, he
lives in a pretty Surrey village
within an eigntpenny return
railway fare of tne Citv; and
has a fairly large and quiet
garden, with field, &c. "The
trees are all at their finest,"
he proceeds, "the flowers look-
ing very gay and walking in
the garden." Capital fun this,
when flowers actually walk
about. But no! it's "walk-
ing in the garden to-day the
thought came to me," so it's
a walking-thought, comparable,
doubtless, to a running com-
mentary. Anyhow, "Rusn-
cus" is moved—by the thought
of a "tired working-man or
band of City workers" who
would find in his garden plea-
sure on a quiet Saturday after-
noon—to make an offer. Here
are his words:—
"I am a bachelor, therefore I
say, men, you are welcome to my
very simple hospitality if it is of
any use to you. I can do with a
limited number every or any
Saturday. Any creed or class is
welcome. All I stipulate for is
honest souls. Come and smoke
and talk under the trees and spend
a quiet time away from the town.
I limply condition—no publicity
or fuss, the giving and acceptance
of the invitation quietlv,houestly,
brother to brother. Would you,
Sir, forward any letteraon to me?"
This is of course an example
which will be followed, and

others), which he now prints
with pleasure.
SIR,—Owing to the Death

man, but I have a little house
in Piccadilly, not more than
a twopenny 'bus ride from
Charing Cross. It has occurred
to me that some hungry work-
ing-man might like to drop in
to a quiet little dinner some
night. I am a Duke, there-
fore I say, comrades in depres-
sion, you are welcome to my
roof, if it's of any use to you.
I can dine a hundred or so of
you any or every night. All I
stipulate for is that there shall

She. Quite. But tell me, have you been attending the Congress 'f
He. Of course; that is why I received an invitation to-night.
She. And you found the lectures and all that most interesting?
He. Yes, very; and then there were the Opera and the theatres in
the evening.
She. But do let us talk about the Congress. Did you not discuss
sanitation?
He. Discussed it very much indeed. So fortunate too that we
had the meeting before everybody had left town.
She. Yes. But did you not inquire into microbes and all that?
He. Certainly; had a lot of talk about them, and finished them all
up just in time not to interfere with Goodwood.
She. And I suppose you found out the way to keep everyone in
perfect health?
He. That was the idea, and yet we floored Lords and the Oval.
She. But oughtn't every town to be in a satisfactory condition?
He. Why, ye«. But that depends upon the season of the year. Of
course, some places are deadly dull when nothing's going on from a
social point of view.
She. I mean from a health point of view—oughtn't everything
nowadays to be simply excellent?
He. Yes, of course. That's the modern theory.
She. And yet, according to the papers, London is full of fever and
insanity.
He. 1 daresay; the Press men generally get their figures right.

things be practically wrong V

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTBACTED FKOM THE DIAKT OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, July 30.—Having settled Budget
Bill, and, incidentally, brought CHANCELLOR OF EXCHEQUER to
Death's Door by observations on Death Duties, TOMMY BOWLES has
time to turn his attention to another social question. Looks as if he
were going to take the Bicycle Fiend by the scruff of the neck.
Herein he has opportunity of deepening and enlarging his hold on
affection and esteem of British public. Bicycle Fiend has increased,
is increasing, and, at least, ought to be registered. He comes upon
the hapless rider or pedestrian in quiet country lanes, brushing him
aside as if the earth were the Fiend's and all the highways thereof.
Bad enough in the country, where there is room to get out of the
way. In crowded streets of metropolis, Fiend pounces round unsus-
pected corners upon elderly gentlemen, ecattering streams of peaceful
passengers at peremptory sound of fearsome bell.
TOMMY B. got his eye on him. Not without suspicion that this
new departure has something to do with old. now closed, campaign
against the Budget. TOMMY warned the SQUIRE whiUt in Com-
mittee that his Death Duties would not reap ihe full harvest antici-
pated. Every little helps. What _ with actual concussions and
sudden frights, Bicycle iiend leads in course of financial year to
considerable succession of propeity changing on sudden death, with
concurrent toll paid to Treasury. If the Bicycle Fiend can only be
placed on same footing as the common carrier, or the harried
hansom-cab driver, the death-rate would appreciably decrease, and
with it the flow of legacy and succession duties. TOMMY may or
may not look thus far ahead. No matter, if he only succeeds in
restraining a nuisance that is a disgrace to a civilised community.
The Member for SAHK tells me he has a Short Way with the B. F.,
which makes him to considerable extent indifferent to slower action
of HOME SECRETARY, who has evidently never had his shins barked
by this agency. SARK says when he takes his walks abroad he
usually carries a stick or umbrella. When, crossing a road, he hears

him out of the way on pain of
being run over, he, instead of fly-
ing for his life, as is the use of the
ordinary citizen, carelessly throws
stick or umbrella lance-wise across
hollow of right or left arm, accord-
ing as the Fiend approaches from
one direction or the other. Thus
armed he leisurely pursues his way.
If the Fiend continues on the track,
he will run with face or chest on
to the point of the umbrella. As
that would be inconvenient to him,
he slows up or goes on another
tack, and when he arrives home
writes a letter to the Bict/cling
Blister, indignantly denouncing a
street passenger who wouldn't get
out of his way.

by swift encounter, in which JOHN MORLEY had followed PRINCE
ARTHUR, and JOSEPH, springing in from behind, had clouted the
CHIEF SECRETARY on the head. The SQUIRE had moved time-
closure on Evicted Tenants Bill in speech the studied tameness and
provoking brevity of which had riled Opposition much more than if he
had belaboured them with Harcourtian phrase. SAGE OF QUEEN
ANNE'S GATE said a few words, preparatory to packing up for
holiday; then COUBTNEY rose from JOSEPH'S tide to continue debate.
Members, taking it for granted that he, possibly with some reserva-
tions in favour of Eviction Bill whose second reading he had sup-
ported, was about to say ditto to JOSEPH on question of Closure, began
to move towards door. Arrested by COURTNEY'S solemn tone, and his
expression of regret, evidently unfeigned, at deplorable condition in

only hirsutejjarb, stave and honeypot. ''Through whom did the

brows upon the bench where the Busy B's hive, "the offence lies

CRIPTOGRAMMATIST WANTED. — After a plain matter-of-fact
paragraph in the Daily Telegraph, stating that "Lord GHEVILLE
leaves town to-day for Harrogate (to undergo the " tonic sul-phur"
cure, of course, i.e., of water-course), there appeared this mysterious
announcement, "Lord Rowroif leaves London to-day for some
tceeks." Now where is " some weeks"? Of course as his Lordship
has quitted town for " some weeks," he evidently prefers "some
weeks," wherever it is, to London. And that is all we know at
present. Strange disappearance. Weird.
THE COSTIR KNIGHT.—There are pictures on almost all the

sidered as the type of an honest " Cheralier d1 Industrie."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MORE ORNAMENTAL
THAN USEFUL.
(A Lfjcrul of the Rtsulls of (lit
Sclwol Board.)
THE Committee sat waiting
patiently for candidates. Al-
though the papers had been
full of advertisements describ-
ing the appointments the
rfclames had had no effect.
There were certainly a number
of persons in the waiting-room,
but the usher hod declared that
they did not possess the ele-
mentary qualifications for the
post that the Committee were
seeking to fill with a suitable
official.
"Usher," cried the Chair-
man sit length with some im-
patience; I am sure you
must be wrong. Let us see
some of the occupants of the
adjoining office."
The usher bowed with a
grace that had been acquired
by several years study in de-
portment in the Board School,
and replied that he fancied
that most of the applicants
were too highly educated for
the coveted position.
"Too highly educated!"
exclaimed the representative
of municipal progress. "It is
impossible to be too highly
educated! You don't know
what you 're talking about!"
"Pardon me, Sir," returned
the Usher, with another grace-
ful inclination of the head,
"but would not 'imperfectly
acquainted with the subject of
your discaurse' be more
polished? But:, wjth your
permission, I will obey you."
And then the official re-

Honest Jiustif. "WELL, THANK Y', SIR, BUT ME AND MY MATE, NOT
SKEIN' A HflWNER ABOUT, WE 'VE TA'KN WHAT THEUE WERE INSIDE."
Why I can't read nor yet
write!"
"Better and better," said
Committee Man No. One.
"First rate," murmured
Committee Man No. Two. "I
think we have at length found
our ideal."
Then the usher read the
advertisement.
"What! shake the hall
mat!" cried the candidate.
"Why I could do that little
job on my head!"
So there being no other
applicant for the post, the
backwoods' ignoramus was
appointed office-sweeper at a
couple of hundred pounds a
year.
"Rather high wages," said
the Chairman to himself, as
he went home on the top of
an omnibus; "but what can
one expert when we educate
all the children at the cost of
the rates. Last year there was
an additional farthing; this
year we have to pay five
shillings, and gondness only
knows how much it will be
hereafter!"
^ And as he thought this, the
Chairman (in the names or the
rest of the ratepayers) heartily
cursed the School' Board.

At length a rough man, who had been lounging down the street,
walked into the Council-chamber.
"What may you want. Sir?" asked the Chairman, indignantly.
"What's that to you 'f" was the prompt reply. "1 ain't a going
to tell everyone my business —not me—you bet!"
"Ungrammaticol!" said Committee Man No. One. "Very pro-

"Uncouth and vulgar!" murmured Committee Man N,o. Two.
"Where were you educated 'i" queried the Chairman.
"Nowheres in particular. I was brought up in the wilds of
Canada. There's not much book learning over there," and the rough
fellow indulged in a loud hoarse laugh.
"Ah! that accounts for your not having enjoyed the great advan-

read the details of the proposed appointment?"
"Me_read!" cried the uncouth one; "oh, that is a game I
Walking" down street. Met another nurse—a real one, I suppose.
She stared, turned red, and then looked horribly offended. I believe
she must have made some sign to me that I didn't understand. Are
Nurses Freemasons, I wonder? Quite a secret society, it seems.
Really that sort of thing oughtn't to be allowed. It makes things
so awkward for the impost—the imitators, I mean.
Just got home after dreadful incident! I was in a Bays water
Square, when suddenly a man driving round a corner in a cart got
upset, and was pitched on to the road close tome. A small crowd
gathered immediately, and evidently expecttd me to help. One man
shouted " Hi 1 Come and bind up his head. Miss!" And his head
was actually bleeding! I couldn't do anything, except feel awfully
inclined to faint, and then the mob began to hiss and jeer! Some-
body said I must know how to render "first aid to the injured,"
and if I didn't come quick the man would bleed to death. I was so
frightened I ran away, and the mob ran after me, and I had to take
shelter in a shop, and ask the shopman to explain to the crowd that
I was not really a nurse at all. Then thev used dreadful expressions,
and I had to be got out by a back way. I don't think the costume is
half as becoming as it seemed this morning; 1 'm going to sell it as
a " cast-off garment." Lucky for me it wasn't a torn-off garment!

"JUSTICE AS SHE IS SPOKEN IN FRANCE."
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—Now that we are close upon the silly season,
when it is most difficult to get interesting "copy" for the columns
of the daily papers, may I be permitted to make a suggestion? No
doubt you have seen an account of the examination of CASKKIO
SANTO oy the President of the Court on the occasion of his trial.
Could not the idea be naturalised in London by the Metropolitan
Police Magistrates? I would not, of course, propose to apply the
method in cases of a serious character, but used in what are known
as "the night charges," the practice would become very interest-
ing. To better explain my meaning. I will imagine that a prisoner
who has been arrested on a charge of being " drunk and incapable" is
standing in front of his worship.

is the curse of the country!

to be your father!
Prisoner. My father! You my father! What an honour!
Magistrate. I do not envy him! Nor your mother!
Prisoner (excitedly). You shall not speak of my mother. My
mother is sacrtd. She shall not be referred to in the tainted atmo-
sphere of a Court of Justice. [Applause.
Magistrate. This hypocrisy shall not serve you. You never loved
your mother! [Prolonged sensation.
Prisoner. Your worship, vou are a liar! [Loud cheers.

you were found drunk and incapable in the gutter. What were you
doing there?

mother. [Sympathetic applause.

SPURRELI,'t (To herself.) I said he
ended in " 'ell"! (Aloud.) So pleased
to see you! We think so much of your
Andromeda here, you know. Quite
delightful of you to find time to run
down 1

chummy, too! Old Drummy pulls me
through everything! (Aloud.) Don't

proud to get your summons!
Lady Culv. (to herself). He doesn't
scorn very revolutionary! (Aloud.)
That's so sweet of you; when so many

rather a run on me just now, but I put
everything else aside for .vew,of course!
Lady Cult: (to herself). He 's soon
reassured. (Aloud, with a touch of
frost.) I am sure we must consider
ourselves most fortunate. (Turning
to the Countess.) You did say cream,
KOHESIA F Sugar, MAISIE dearest?
Siptirr. (to himself). I'm all right
up to now! I suppose I 'd better say
nothing about the horse till the;/ do.
I feel ruther out of it among these
nobs, though. I '11 try and chum on
to little Lady MAISIE again; she may
have got over her temper by this time,
and she's the only one I Icnow. (He
approaches her.) Well. Lady MAISIE,
here I am, you see. I 'd really no idea
your aunt would be so friendly! I
pay, you know, you don't mind speak-
ing to a fellow, do you? 1 'ye no one
else I can go to—and—and it's a bit
strange at first, you know!
Lady Maisie (coloured with mint/led
apprehension, relation, and pity). If
I can be of any help to you, Mr.
SPUKBELL!
Npurr. Well, if you 'd only tell me
what I ought to do?
Ladv Maisie. Surely that's very simple; do nothing; just take
everything quietly as it comes, and you can't make any mis-
takes.
Npurr. (anj-ioiislif). And you don't think anybody '11 see anything
odd in my being here like this?
Lady Maisie (to herself). I 'm only too afraid they will.' (Aloud.)
You really must have a little self-confidence. Just remember that
no one here could produce anything a millionth part as splendid as
your Andromeda.' It's too distressing to see you so appallingly
humble! (To herself.) There's Captain THICKNKSSE over there—he
miiiht come and rescue me; but he doesn't seem to care to!
Npurr. Well, you do put some heart into me, Lady MAISIE. I feel
equal to the lot of 'em now I
Pilliaer (In Miss SPEI.WANE). Is that the Poet? Why, but I say
—he'sa. fraud.' Where's his matted head? He's not a bit ragged,
or rusty either. And why don't he dabble? Don't seem to know
what to do with his hands quite, though, does he?
Miss Spelicane (coldly). He knows how to do some very exquisite
poetry with one of them, at all events. I 've been reading it, and /
think it perfectly marvellous!
Pill. 1 see what it is, you 're preparing to turn his matted head

"My keys! Why, what do you wiint them furV"

Aim. MAISIE and he used to be great
friends. . . . Ah, how do you do, Cap-

finding you here; such ages since we
saw anything of you! Why haven't
you been near us all this time ? . ..
Oh, I may have been out once or twice
when you called; but you might have
tried again, mightn't you? There, /for-
give you; you had better go and see if
you can make vour peace with MAJSIE!

Lady Cant, (in a whisper). He's
always been such a favourite of mine.

it will make a great difference—in

Capt. Thick. How arc you? Been
hearin' a lot about you lately. Andro-

Spurr. It's wonderful what a hit she
seems to have made—not that I 'm sur-

Do go and get some before it's taken

Lady Maisie. Was I? So absorbed as all that! Wrhat with?
Capt. Thick. Well, it looked like it—with talkin' to your poetical
friend.
Lady Maisie (.flushing). He is not my friend in particular; I—I
admire his poetry, of course.
Capt. Thick, (to himself). Can't even speak of him without
a change of colour. Bad sign that! (Aloud.) You always were
keen about poetry and literature and that in the old days, weren't
you? Used to rag me for not readin' enough. But 1 do now. 1 was
readin' a book only last week. I '11 tell you the name if you give me
a minute to think—book everybody 's readin' just now -iio end of a
clever book. [Miss SPEI.WANE rushes across to Lady MAISIE.
Miss Spelw. MAISIE, dear, how are you? You look so tired!
That's the journey, I suppose. (Whispering.) Do tell me—is that
really the author of Andromeda drinking tea close by? You're a
great friend of his, I know. Do be a dear, and introduce him to me!
I declare the dogs have made friends with him already. Poets have
such a wonderful attraction for animals, haven't they?
[Lady MAISIE has to bring SPURKELL up and introduce him;
for him? I warn you you '11 only warte your sweetness. That
Captain THICKNESSE chooses to consider himself dismissed.

When the dot-tor shakes hii head,
Banning wine or white or red,
And at nil my well-lovtd joints
When my poultry too he stops,
Then, reduced to taking " slops,"
I, for solace and relief.
Fly to thee, 0 Tea of Beef!
But—if simple truth I tell—

Thy delights, <) Bovine; Tea,
Have no special charm for me!
Though thou comest piping hot,

'TO BE TAKEN AS READ."
DEAR MB. PUNCH.—Thanks to the action of the Circulating
Libraries, it seems that the old-fashioned three-volume novel is
doomed to become a work of the past. Most of the popular writers
have abandoned it, and now the publishers are beginning to right
shy of it. The principal argument,
I believe, in favour of its retention
is that it gives a chance to "the
little read.'r The Circulating Libra-
ries are called upon to fill boxes
intended for the eoification of sub-
scribers in the country, and in
these receptacles of light literature
I believe the unpopular authors
have their greatest chance. But
v-._,_ as a matter of fact, although a
romance may be sent to a peruser,
it is not within the scope of civili-
sation to cause that romance to be
read. According to statistics I be-
lieve about sixty per cent of the
second and third rate is only
sampled by the recipients of the
aforesaid boxes. The last couple
of pages of the third volume are
s- largely read, whilst the remainder
of the work is saved from the
labours of the paper-knife. As this is so, would it not be as well to
give a "common form" finale to serve as a model for novels in
extremis f To make my meaning plainer I will give an example.
Let me suppose that the country subscriber has received a novel per
mrcels post called The Deed in Drab. Instead of having to cut some
line hundred pages, he finds gummed to the inside of the cover what
[ may call
THE LAST CHAPTER.
And so amidst the joy bells of the old church and the songs of the
nightingales, and the pleasant laughter of the little children, EDWIN
ind ANGELINA were married. As they passed under the oaken porch
he Duke gave them his blessing. Need it be said they lived happily
—like a prince and a princess in fairy tale—for ever after?
Captain MoxTMORENrv GUILT, kicked out of his club and warned oft'
he Turf at Newmarket, left England with his ill-gotten gains fur
Jairo. Arrived in Egypt, he disappeared into the Soudan. Those
of the Arabs who came from the desert declare that there is a white
ruler in Khartoum. Whether it be he, who knows? Still, the stories
rf cruelty brought back by the swarthy traders are not OUngMktive
f the man who brought poor PAULINE to her grave and broke the
5ank at Monte Carlo.
EDWARD WATTS did marry MARY BEETLES, and they are now doing
well at Little Pannington. The village all-sorts shop has grown into a
'Stores," and those who are in the know say that at a near date it
rill be converted into a "Company, Limited." Be this as it may,
HOWARD and MART drive to chapel in their own gig.
And what became of PAUL PETERSON? Overwhelmed with the
ecret sorrow that could never be shared by another, he went his
way to the wilds of Australia. And there, under the starlight
inuence of the Southern Cross, and amidst the glorious glaciers of
he Boomerang Mountains, he tries to forget the terrible and half-
orgiven details of the " Deed in Drab."
THE END.
There, Sir, you have the ending of ninety-nine novels out of
possible hundred. In the hands of an experienced writer the
entences mig^ht be so adapted as to meet the requirements of the
wok completing the century. Surely the suggestion is worthy of
ic attention of a MuniK, and the consideration of a W. H. SMITH
Disapproving finger points;
Your* faithfully, Mri/rrM IN PARVO.

"TO BE TAKEN AS READ."
DEAR MR. PUNCH.—Thanks to the action of the Circulating
Libraries, it seems that the old-fashioned three-volume novel is
doomed to become a work of the past. Most of the popular writers
have abandoned it, and now the publishers are beginning to fight
shy of it. _ The principal argument,
I believe, in favour of its retention
is that it gives a chance to "the
little read.'r The Circulating Libra-
ries are called upon to till boxes
intended for the edification of sub-
scribers in the country, and in
these receptacles of light literature
I believe the unpopular authors
have their greatest chance. But
as a matter of fact, although a
romance may be sent to a peruser,
it is not within the scope of civili-
sation to cause that romance to be
read. According to statistics I be-
Sp\\\ lieve about sixty per cent of the
second and third rate is only
sampled by the recipients of the
,-JT~ -,3 aforesaid boxes. The last couple
of pages of the third volume are
largely read, whilst the remainder
of the work is saved from the
labours of the paper-knife. As this is so, would it not be as well to
give a "common form" finale to serve as a model for novels in
extremis f To make my meaning plainer I will give an example.
Let me suppose that the country subscriber has received a novel per
parcels post called The Deed in Drab. Instead of having to cut some
line hundred pages, he finds gummed to the inside of the cover what
[ may call
THE LAST CHAPTER.
And so amidst the joy bells of the old church and the songs of the
nightingales, and the pleasant laughter of the little children, EDWIX
and ANGELINA were married. As they passed under the oaken porch
the Duke gave them his blessing. Need it be said they lived happily
—like a prince and a princess in fairy tale—for ever after?
Captain MO.NTMORENOY GUILT, kicked out of his club and warned off
he Turf at Newmarket, left England with his ill-gotten gains for
2airo. Arrived in Egypt, he disappeared into the Soudan. Those
af the Arabs who came from the desert declare that there is a white
ruler in Khartoum. Whether it be he, who knows;" Still, the stories
if cruelty brought back by the swarthy traders are not OMDgMktivc
if the man who brought poor PAULINE to her grave and broke the
Jank at Monte Carlo.
EDWARD WATTS did marry MARY BEETLES, and they are now doing
well at Little Pannington. The village all-sorts shop has grown into a
'Stores," and those who are in the know say that at a near date it
rill be converted into a "Company, Limited." Be this as it may,
HOWARD and MART drive to chapel in their own gig.
And what became of PAUL PETERSON? Overwhelmed with the
ecret sorrow that could never be shared by another, he went his
way to the wilds of Australia. And there, under the starlight
nrfufnoe of the Southern Cross, and amidst the glorious glaciers of
te Boomerang Mountains, he tries to forget the terrible and half-
orgiven details of the " Deed in Drab."
THE END.
There, Sir, you have the ending of ninety-nine novels out of
possible hundred. In the hands of an experienced writer the
entences might be so adapted as to meet the requirements of the
xx>k completing the century. Surely the suggestion is worthy of
ie attention of a MDDIK, and the consideration of a W. II. SMITH

STROLL IN THE ZOO. SUNDAY AFTERNOON.
THE MESSAGE FROM MAES.
(Per fa vour of ifr. Punch.)
Mr. Punch. So you "ve not been signalling lo Mother Earth, after
all. my noble Warrior?
Man (tcith a iriiik). What do i/nn think? Why should 1 dji?
canals 100 miles wide, and 2,000 miles long, or build 'bonfires as big
as Scotland, when I can always communicate what I may have to say
through you?
Because Mars looks spotty or misty,
Some dreamers, with intellects twisty,
Imagine, old horse,
Mars is playing at Morse!
All bosh! You ask DYSON or CHRISTIE.
Mr. Punch. Mr. MAUNDER "has you under his special charge,"
hasn't he? •
Mars. Much obliged to Mr. MAUNDER, I 'm sure! Wants to take
my photo, doesn't he 'f As if I were a mere politician, a popular
comedian, or 'ARRJET at the seaside on a Bank Holiday!
Mr. Punch. Have you anv Bank Holidays in your planet?
Mam. Thank Sol, Mr. Punch, we have outlived the epoch of
taking our pleasure in spasms, like your cockney victims of the
vulgar voluptuary's St. Yitus's dance!
Mr. Punch. Don't be uppish, old man! 'Tis an ill-bred age of
Kodaks', and Interviews, and other phases of popular Paul Pryism.
But you 've had your ignominious moments, Mars. If a "snap-
shot" could have been taken at you when held prostrate, chained,
and captive, at the feet of Otus and Ephialtes, or, still worse, when
caught with Venus in the iron net of Vulcan :—
All heaven beholds, imprison'd as they lie,
And um-xtinguish'd laughter shakes the sky.
Mars. Spare me, excellent Punch. Eugh! Thank heaven
Olympus knew no Kodaks then, or "the gay Apollo" would yet
longer have had the laugh of me.
Mr. Punch. Pardon me for awaking unpleasant memories! But
even gods should not be bumptious, especially when, like the Second
Mm. Tanqurray, they " have a past.
Mars. Well, 'anyhow I 've been able to baffle the camera-wielders
up to now. My ruddy countenance and "bluish radiance" have
beaten Greenwich, and even lic-ked the Lick! As they themselves
admit, "Mars up to the present has defied cameral detection."
Mr. Punch. But what about those " bright spots"?
Mars. Have you no "bright spots" even on your dull and foggy
old planet'; I have often noticed one at H.">, Fle-t Street. In June
and December it emits thousands of brilliant sparks of a " bluish
"signalling" to me. Look, the naked eye can see the Punchian
"projection litmiiieuse" even from here!
Mr. Punch. I do not have to " signal" my mes.-a?cs to " Hellas"
or "LOCKYER'S Land" by canals or "ten million arc lights of
100,000 candle-power apiece." Like the Sun, I am self-luminous,
and do not, like the finest planets, shine by reflected light.
Mars. True for you. And from your own intellectual observatory,
like TEUFKLSDBOECKH " alone with the stars," you ofttimes scan the
heavens when, as LONGFELLOW says:—
"the first wateh of night is given
To the rod planet Mars."
Mr. Punch. Precisely!
And earnest thoughts within me rise
When I behold afar,
Suspended in the evening skies
The shield of thut red star.
A star of strength! I see thce Btand
And smile upon my pain;
[Murmurs musingly,
Thou beckonest with thy mailed hand,
And I am strong again.
The star of the uneonquered will
lie rises in my breast.
Serene, and resolute and still,
And calm, and self-possessed.
Mars. Ah yes! that's all very pretty and poetical, and I 'm much
obliged to HENRY WADSWORTH and the other bards who have lyric-
ally glorified me. But Punch, old man, you and I know letter.'
Mother Earth has ever paid, and payeth still, far too much worship
to Mars—the Mars of her own militant fancy. To tell you the truth,
Punch, I 'm sick of my old metier, especially since Science stepped in
and bedevilled it past bearing with her big guns, and dynamite-
bombs, and treacherous torpedoes; weapons more fit for grubby
Vulcan's subterranean Cyclops than a god, a gentleman and a soldier
like me.
Mr. Punch. Hoho! That'sthe way the (LOCKTKU'S) land lies, eh?
Mars. Exactly, /wasn't signalling to your stupid, conservative,
bellicose old world, which, like the Bum-Imps, learns nothing and
forgets nothing. Could I write in plain Titanic capitals across a
thousand square miles of my smoothest surface Mars s Straight Tip
to Mother Earth, viz.:—
FIGHTING'S AN EXPENSIVE BORE,
SO DISARM AKI) WAH NO .MORE!
what effect would it have on any of you, from civilised England,
with you to enlighten it, to the furious fighting dragons who are
tearing each other in the eastern seas? None! But if any of your
quidnuncs really want to know what I would say if I tliil signal,
tell them old Mars, grown wiser, has turned up War; has nailed
his raven to a barn-door as a warning; has made a pet of Peace's
soft-plumed dove; and strongly advises the belligerent loobies on
earth who take his old name in vain, and play his abandoned game
still, to — go and do likewise !.'!

ODE TO IXION.
(By a Sympathetic, but Super-

OH ! the hardest of hearts some
compassion must feel
For that modern Ixion, the
Man on the AVheel!
See him scouring the roads on
his spindly-spoked spider,
Dust-hid till you scarce tell
the " bike " from its rider •
His abdomen shrunken, his
shoulders up-humped,
With the gaping parched lips
of one awfully pumped.
Could a camel condemned to
the treadmill look worse?
Sure those lips,Jcould he close
them, would shape to a curse
On his horrible doom I As I
gaze and stand by.
With a pang at my heart, and
a tear in my eye.

And other poor victims of piti-

were frightful indeed,
The Bicyclist's fate is the
worser by far.

and a "pull" at the "bar,"

III.—THE KIME OF THE ANCIENT
SAWBATH-BRBAKER.
(Being a Record of the \1th.)
IT was an ancient poacher-man,
Bronzed as a penny-bun;—
"By thy beady eye, now tell
me why,
Thou offspring of a gun,
0 tell me why beneath thy
Exceeding hoary tnft[chin's
Precisely half a brace of grouse
Hangs, admirably stuffed:"'
He blinked his beady eye; his
voice
Was singularly clear;
And as I listened to his tale
I could not choose but hear.
"M on, ye mun ken I have not
aye
Been sec a feckless loon;
In me behold the wreck of what
Was once The McAHOOJf.
Oft have I made a merrie bag
Across my native heath;
Shot o'er my ain ancestral
dawgs
Or aiblins underneath.
Until lang syne, a monie year —
Ye couldna weel be born—
The blessed twalfth of August
fell
Upon a Sawbath morn.
Braw were the birds, my gun
was braw,
My bluid was pipia' hot:
1 l l.o hi it crime to gie em
time-
-Allowance like a yacht.
Scarce had I bagged but aw
wee bird,
There was the de'il to pay:
It's unco deadly skaith wi'
Scots
To break the Sawbath day.

The billies wha the nicht before
Were fou at my expense,
They deaved the meenister
aboot
My verra bad offence.
An' a' the Kirk declared the
work
Was perfect deevilrie,
An' hung the bird by this
absurd
Arrangement whilk ye tee.
Twal' month an' mair my
shame I bear
Beneath the curse o' noon,
A paltry wraith of what was
once
The Laird o' McAsoojf.
An' aye when fa's the blessed
twalfth
Upo' the Sawbath day,
I bear the bird in this absurd
An' aggravatin' way."
The ancient ceased his sorry
tale,
And craved a trifling boon,
To wet the whistle of what
was once
The Laird o' McAROOX.
Ditto to Mr. Courtney.
As after jackdaw chatter and
owl-hooting,

I FOUND (he pi eat man surrounded by plans and models of any
number of wonderful inventions. Here was a clever scheme for
spending a week's holilay in the Mountains of the Moon, there a
recipe for removing the spits from the

The great man tmiled. lie evidently

aerial contrivances to all the countries of the earth? What is thi re to

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[AUGUST 18, 1894.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Hmue of Lords, Monday Night, August C.—MARKISS expected to
continue to-night that speech around the Budget he didn't commence
on second reading of the Bill. Sat mysteriously quiet on that
occasion. Unexpectedly hroke out at following sitting, wanting to
know what HERSCHELL meant by saying Judicial Committee of Privy
Council had arrived at conclusion that Lords had no power to amend
a money bill. "Where's your report?" he asked. "Produce it."
LORD CHANCELLOR didn't happen to have it in his waistcoat pocket
or secreted in wig. MABKISS gave notice that he would to-night
formally move for production of report. Flutter of interest in House.
bright things to say; but what was one speech among so many?
Pensh his speech, rather than the whole arrangements of Parliamen-
tary week be upset. So gracefully stood aside; DILLON took his
half hour; JOHN MORI.EY followed in •vigorous fighting form,
marking fresh step in steady improvement as Parliamentary debater;
and before midnight all was over.
Business done. — Evicted Tenants Bill read third time by 199
votes against 167.
Wednesday.—M. do Londres—the Hangman, as blunt Britons put
it—called to-day. House engaged on Committee of Equalisation
of Rates Bill; seat found for Monsieur under Gallery, whore ]>riv;ite
secretaries of ministers and heads of public offices sit when Bills
affecting their departments are under discussion.
Commons flocked in prepared for some fresh "blazing indiscre- "Monsieur has something to do with the Home Office, n'est re
tion." Found the MARKISS sitting on woolsack chatting with LORD pas ?" I asked SARK. "Looked in, I suppose, to help ASUCITII'("
CHANCELLOR. Held book between them, as
young persons about to marry are wont to do
when attending morning or evening service.
Vague idea that presently they would rise and
sing a hymn. LORD CHANCELLOR quite equal
t > it, being a big gun at the Bar Musical So-
ciety and very fond of the Opera. Nothing
however came of it, at least, not in that direc-
tion. When hour for public business arrival
MABKISS left woolsack carrying the tune book
with him. His motion for report of Judicial
Committee stood half way down Orders of the
Day. When it was reached MARKISS said
nothing. Naturally other peers were silent,
and whilst commoners accustomed to other
ways of transacting business were marvellinsr
as to what had happened, and what would
follow, House adjourned, practically for a
week.
"Well," said SABK for once nonplussed:
"certainly if there is a place in the world
where 'e don't know where 'e are, it's the
House of Lords. When a peer is expected to
speak he sits dumb. When arrangements have
been made for a quiet sitting, the MARKISS or
some other big gun is sure to go off unex-
pectedly with alarming consequences."
Business dune.—Irish Evicted Tenants Bill
passed Report Stage in Common".
Tuesday.—It is the unexpected that happens
in the House of Commons. Befel to-night with
dramatic suddenness. Third reading of Evicted
Tenants Bill moved. At eleven o'clock JOSEPH
resumed his seat with pleased consciousness of
having cast some balm, in the shape of vitriol,
over Irish Question. House crowded; DEVON-
SHIRE, in depression and dinner dress, looked
down from Peers' Gallery. Over the clock sat
SANDHURST, presently to move first reading of
Bill in House of Lords. Arranged Bill should
finally leave Commons to-night. Only one
hour in which PRINCE ARTHUR might speak,
and JOHN MORLEY reply. JOSEPH haying des-
patched his final arrow at his old friends the
Irish Members, the shaft being barbed with
points composing pleasing legend, "Violence,
Agitation, Dishonesty," PRINCE ARTHUR rose,
with evident intent of showing, as has hap-

No," said the Member for S.VKK. "It's
not that. He 's heard House intends to sus-
pend the Standing Orders. Wants to see how
tee go to work. Not above taking a wrinkle
even from amateurs."
"Ah," said W. P. JACKSON, throwing up his
hands with gesture of despair. "Knew it
would come to this under present Government.
First the guillotine, then the gallows."
Business done.— Quite a lot.
Thursday.—Southerners long heard of plea-
surable hours spent in Committee-room up-
stairs, where Scotch Members been engaged
for weeks in Grand Committee on their Local
Government Bill. Sueh badinage! such per-
siflage! not omitting refreshing influences of
another kind familiar in Nortes Ambrosianrr.
'Tis said, when conversation flagged quite usual
tiling for J. B. BALFOURand CHARLES PEARSON
to strip off coats and waistcoats, place two
umbrellas crosswise on floor, and go through
sword-dance, TREVELYAN in the chair leading
off colourable imitation of bagpipe accompani-
ment, in which Committee joined in mad
chorus.
Not sure about that. Absolutely no doubt
that on last day of meeting all the members
stood on chairs, with one foot on the table, and,
holding hands, sang "Auld Lang St/ne."
Bound to say they seem to have exhausted all
their hilarity in Committee-room. PARKER
SMITH still a good deal to say; HO/.IER not
uncommunicative; and WALTER M'LAREN
i njoys keen satisfaction of insisting on Division
that presents smallest minority of the series.
But, on the whole, House eeems filled with what
HARK tell me Edinburgh, occasionally suffering
from the visitation, calls " an easterly haar."
Through the cold, wet, white fog, comes one
gleam of light. JOHN MORLEY brings in a Bill
making further provision with respect to Irish
Congested Districts Board. SPEAKER puts cus-
tomary question, " Who is prepared to bring in
this ffijl?" "Mr. ARTHUR BALFOUR and
myself," responds the CHIEF SECRETARY ;_ and
the House gratefully goes off into a tit of
laughter.
"Lovely in life," exclaims DAVID PLUNKET,
pened several times this Session, how the same The Macgregor prop08(,s to.; ,038 the Cubcr,,_ looking with almost equal affection on his- two
sort of thing may be said with better effect in next Session! right hqn. friends, on the Congested Districts
quite another way.
Simultaneously from below gangway uprose the tall figure of
DILLON. Opposition roared with despairing indignation. Every-
thing settled, to last button on the gaiter; JOSEPH nad had his half-
hour; Prince ARTHUR would take his, honourably leaving JOHN
MORLEY his thirty minutes. Then Division called; Bill read third
time; sent on to Lords; Commons comfortably home by half-past
twelve. And here was JOHN DILLON claiming the right to reply to
attacks and inuendos of the genial JOSEPH!
Tumult rose • DILLON folded his arms and faced it. A bad sign
that gesture. Remember it in years gone by, when all things were
topsy-turvev; when FOKSTER was Chief Secretary, and, next to
PABNELL, the hope of the Irish Members fighting for Home Rule
was JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN.
DILLON in that attitude evidently immoveable; various suggestions
offered. Evade the Twelve o'Clock Rule, and sit till all was over;
adjourn the Debate. Finally agreed that Debate should be adjourned
till to-morrow—to-morrow, the day on which, at end of last real
fight of Session, most Members were off on the delayed holiday.
Out of this dilemma PRINCE ARTHUR delivered a grateful House.
Board (Iivland) Bill they are not divided."
Business done.—Scotch Local Government Bill.
Friday.—Another '' Nicht wi' BURNS." Sadder even than the last.
But sooner over. By eleven o'clock report stage agreed to. "Shall
we take third reading now, or would you like a third night with the
Bill ?"a<ked TREVELYAN.
A shudder ran through the House; when it was over Bill hurried
past final stage. Business done.—Winding-up rabidly.
THE NEW NEWNESS.
"THERE is nothing new under the sun."
So said the proverbial preacher.
But surely 'twas only his fun!
A modern and up-to-date teacher
Would tell him that Humour, and Art,
And Daughters, and Wives, and Morality,
All aim to make a fresh start
In novel (and nauseous) reality;
And the wail of the Wise Man will be, pretty soon,
Had prepared his speech through long sitting; doubtless had many
"There is nothing old under the sun—or the moon!"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TO A SUBREY HOSTESS.
(A Parodic Vote of Thanks to a Town Matron,
who took a House in the Country,)
LADY CLARA SHERE DE SHERE,
Through me you now shall win renown;
It nearly broke my country heart
To come back to the dusty town.
In kindliest way, you bade
me stay
And nothing better I de-
sired,
But Duty with a great big D
Called far too loud, and
I retired.
Lady CLARA SHERE DE
SHERE
I wonder if you'll like

your name
«£/>"
Oh! how you all began to
chaff
And laugh the moment
that I came.
Yet would I take more for
the sake
Of your dear daughter's
girlish charms.
A simple maiden not yet four
Is good to take up in one's arms.
Lady CLAEA SHERE DE SHERE,
Some newer pupil you must rind,
Who, when you pile his plate sky-high,
Will meekly Bay he does not mind.
You sought to beat my power to eat,
An empty plate was my reply.
The cat you left in Grosvenor Square
Is not more hungry now than I.
Lady CLABA SHEKE DE SHKRE, _
You sometimes took a mother's view,
And feared lest winsome DOROTHY
Should learn too much from me—or jou.
Indeed I heard one bitter word
That scarce were fit for her to hear;
Our language had not that repose
Which rightly tits a SHERE DE SHEKE.
Lady CLARA SHERK DE SHERE.
The marriage bells rang for the Hall.
The flags were flying at your door;
You spoke of them with curious gall.
How you decried the pretty bride
And swore her dresses weren't by WORTH,
And gaily went to church to stare
At ner of far too noble birth.
Trust me, CLARA SHERE DE SHEHE,
The man I saw who'a rather bent,
The grand old gardener at your house
Prefers the bride of high descent.
Ilowe'er that be, it seems to me
'Tis all important what one eats.
Milk pudding's more than caviare,
And simple food than coloured sweets.
CLARA, CLARA SHERE DE SHERE,
If time be heavy on your hands,
And there are none within your reach
To play at tennis on your lands,
Oh! Fee the tennis court is marked,
And take care that it doesn't rain,
Then stay at Shere another month
And ask me down to stay again.
A VOICE FROM "THE UPPER SUCKLES.'
MY tiOOD MR. PUNCH,— I notice that in
spite of all London being out of town, a
number of persons have been holding, or pro-
pose holding, a meeting condemnatory or the
House of Lords. I fancy, regardless of the
close of the seasr.n, the site chosen has been
or will be Hyde Park. Perhaps, under these
circumstances, you, as the representative oJ
the nation—equally of the aristocracy and
;he democracy—will allow me a few lines
space in which to express my sentiments.
My good Sir, I am considerably past
niddle age, and yet, man and boy, have
>een in the House of Peers quite half-a-
dozen years. I cannot sav that I was added
:o the number of my colleagues because I
was an eminent lawyer, or a successful
reneral, or a great statesman. I believe
ny claim to the distinction that was con-
:erred upon me,—now many summers since,
—was the very considerable services I was
able to afford that most useful industry the
japer decoration of what may be aptly
:ermed "the wooden walls of London.
When called upon to select an appropriate
;erritorial title, I selected, without hesitation,
:he Barony of Savon de Soapleigh. Savon
s a word of French extraction, and denotes
ihe Norman origin of my illustrious race.
Sot only was I able to assist at the regenera-
tion of the " great unwashed," but also to do
considerable service to the grand cause with
which my party in politics is honourably
associated. I was able to contribute a very
large sum to the election purse, and having
fought and lost several important consti-
tuencies, was amply rewarded by the coronet
that becomes me so well, the more especially
when displayed upon the panelsof my carriage.
You will ask me, no doubt (for this is an
age of questions), what I have done since I
entered the Upper Chamber? I will reply
that I have secured a page in Burke, abstained
from voting, except to oolige the party whips,
and, before all and above all, pleased my lady
wife. And yet there are those who would
wibh to abolish the House of Peers! There
are those who would do away with our ancient
nobility! Perish the thought I for in the
House of Peers I see the reflection of the
nation's greatness.
But you may ask
me, "Would I do
anything to improve
that Chamber?"
And I would answer,
"Yes." I would
say, "Do not in-
crease its numbers;
it is already large
enough."
It is common know-
ledge that a gentle-
man of semi-medi-
cinal reputation, who
has been as beneficial,
ornearlyas beneficial,
to the proprietors of
hoardings as myself,
wishes to be created
Viscount Cough of Mixture. Yet another
of the same class desires to be known to
generations yet unborn as Lord Tobacco of
Cigarettes j whilst a third, on account of
the attention he has paid to the "under-
standings" (pardon the plaisanterie) of the
people, is anxious to figure on the roll of
honour as " Baron de Boots."
My good Mr. Punch, such an extension
of the House of Peers merely for the satis-
faction of the vanity of a number of vulgar
and puffing men would be a scandal to our
civilisation. No, my good Sir, pur noble
order is large enougn. I am satisfied that
it should not be extended, and when I am
satisfied the opinions of every one else are
(and here I take a simile from an industry
that has given me my wealth) "merely
bubbles—bubbles of soap."
And now I sign myself, not as of old, plain
JOE SNOOKS, but Yours very faithfully,
SAVON DE SOAI'LEIGH.
P.S.—I am sure my long line of ancestors
would agree with me. When that long line
is discovered you shall hear the result.

BYGONES.
TIIK midsummer twilight is dying,
The golden is turning to gray,
And my troublesome thoughts are a-flying
To the days that have vanished away,
Whenlifehadno
crosses for me,
love,
But Proctors
and bulldogs
and dons,
And I used to
write sonnets to
thee, love,
In the dreamy
old garden of
John's.

By Jove! What
a time we just
had, love,
That M'eek you
were up for
Commem.!
The dances and
{>icnics — egad,
ove,
How strange
to be thinking
of them!
How we laughed at the dusty old doctors,
And the Vice with his gorgeous gold gown.
And you thought it a shame that the Proctors
Were constantly sending me down.
We danced and we dined and we boated,
Did the lions all quite cornnie ilfaut,
And I felt a strange thrill when you voted
Old JOHNNIE'S the best of the show.
I remember your eager delight, love,
With our garden and chapel and hall—
And oh, for that glorious night, love,
When we went to the Balliol ball!
There is very poor pleasure in dancing
In a stuffv hot ball-room in June—
And the Balliol lawn looked entrancing
In the silvery light of the moon.
I fancy the thought had occurred, love,
To somebody else besides me,
For I managed, with scarcely a word, love,
To get you to smile and agree.
We sat on the Balliol lawn, love,
And the hours flew as fast as you please,
Till the rosy-tipped fingers of dawn, love,
Crept over the Trinity trees.
A stranger might say he had never
Heard trash in a vapider key;
But no conversation has ever
Been half so delicious to me.
I seemed to be walking on air, love;
And oh, how I quivered when you
Snipped off a wee lock of your hair, love.
And said you were fond of me too.
I clasped it again and again, love,
To my breast with a passionate vow.
There ever since it has lain, love,
And there it is lying just now.
—Hut my heart gives a horrible thump, love,
1 find myself gasping for air,
For my throat is choked up with a lump,
love,
Which surely should never be therr.
And I tadly bethink me that life, live,
Won't always run just as we will—
For you are another man's wife, love,
And I am a bachelor still
Common (Gas) Metre.
"LIGHT metres" there are many,
The lightest of the lot
Is what is called " the Penny-
-in-the-Slot!"

And laugh the moment
that I came.
Yet would I take more for
the sake
Of your dear daughter's
girlish charms.
A simple maiden not yet four
Is good to take up in one's arms.
Lady CLARA SHERE DE SHERE,
Some newer pupil you must find,
Who, when you pile his plate sky-high,
Will meekly say he does not mind.
You sought to beat my power to eat,
An empty plate was my reply.
The cat you left in Grosvenor Square
Is not more hungry now than I.
Lady CLARA SHEKE DE SHKRE, <
You sometimes took a mother's view,
And feared lest winsome DOROTHY
Should learn too much from me—or jou.
Indeed I heard one bitter word
That scarce were fit for her to hear;
Our language had not that repose
Which rightly fits a SHIRE DE SHKKE.
Lady CLARA SHERR DE SHERE.
The marriage bells rang for the Hall.
The flags were flying at your door;
You spoke of them with curious gall.
How you decried the pretty bride
And swore her dresses weren't by WORTH,
And gaily went to church to stare
At ner of far too noble birth.
Trust me, CLARA SHERE DE SUERE,
The man I saw who's rather bent,
The grand old gardener at your house
Prefers the bride of high descent.
Howe'er that be, it seems to me
'Tis all important what one eats.
Milk pudding's more than caviare,
And simple food than coloured sweets.
CLARA, CLAEA SHERE DE SHERE,
If time be heavy on your hands,
And there are none within your reach
To play at tennis on your lands,
Oh! fee the tennis court is marked,
And take care that it doesn't rain,
Then stay at Shere another month
And ask me down to stay again.
A VOICE FROM "THE UPPER SUCKLES.'
MY GOOD MR. PUNCH,— I notice that in
spite of all London being out of town, a
number of persons have been holding, or pro-
pose holding, a meeting condemnatory of the
House of Lords. I fancy, regardless of the
close of the season, the site chosen has been
or will be Hyde Park. Perhaps, under these
circumstances, you, as the representative oJ
the nation—equally of the aristocracy and
,he democracy—will allow me a few lines
space in which to express my sentiments.
My good Sir. I am considerably past
niddle age, ana yet, man and boy, have
leen in the House of Peers quite half-a-
dozen years. I cannot sav that I was added
o the number of my colleagues because I
was an eminent lawyer, or a successful
general, or a great statesman. I believe
ny claim to the distinction that was con-
ferred upon me,—now many summers since,
—was the very considerable services I was
able to afford that most useful industry the
paper decoration of what may be aptly
termed "the wooden walls of London.
When called upon to select an appropriate
territorial title, I selected, without hesitation,
the Barony of Savon de Soapleigh. Savon
is a word of French extraction, and denotes
the Norman origin of my illustrious race.
Not only was I able to assist at the regenera-
tion of the " great unwashed,'"' but also to do
considerable service to the grand cause with
which my party in politics is honourably
associated. I was able to contribute a very
large sum to the election purse, and having
fought and lost several important consti-
tuencies, was amply rewarded by the coronet
that becomes me so well, the more especially
when displayed upon the panelsof my carriage.
You will ask me, no doubt (for this is an
age of questions), what I have done since I
entered the Upper Chamber? I will reply
that I have secured a page in Burke, abstained
from voting, except to oblige the party whips,
and, before all and above all, pleased my lady
wife. And yet there are those who would
wish to abolish the House of Peers! There
are those who would do away with our ancient
nobility! Perish the thought 1 for in the
House of Peers I see the reflection of the
nation's greatness.
But you may ask
me, "Would I do
anything to improve
that Chamber?"
And I would answer.
"Yes." I would
say, "Do not in-
crease its numbers;
it is already large
enough."
It iscommon know-
ledge that a gentle-
man of semi-medi-
cinal reputation, who
has been as beneficial,
or near) y as beneficial,
to the proprietors 01
hoardings as myself,
wishes to be created
Viscount Cough of Mixture. Yet another
of the same class desires to be known to
generations yet unborn as Lord Tobacco
Cigarettes; whilst a third, on account
the attention he has paid to the "under-
standings" (pardon the plaisanterie) of the
people, is anxious to figure on the roll of
honour as " Baron de Boots."
My good Mr. Punch, such an extension
of the House of Peers merely for the satis-
faction of the vanity of a number of vulgar
and puffing men would be a scandal to our
civilisation. No, my good Sir, pur noble
order is large enough. I am satisfied that
it should not be extended, and when I am
satisfied the opinions of every one else are
(and here I take a simile from an industry
that has given me my wealth) "merely
bubbles—bubbles of soap."
And now I sign myself, not as of old, plain
JOE SNOOKS, but Yours very faithfully,
SAVON DE SOAI-LEIGH.
P.S.—I am sure my long line of ancestors
would agree with me. When that long line
is discovered you shall hear the result.
BYGONES.
TIIK midsummer twilight is dying,
The golden is turning to gray,
\ndniy troublesome thoughts are n-flying
To the (lays that have vanished awny,
When life hud no
crosses for me,
love,
But Proctors
and bulldogs
and Anns,
And I used to
write sonnets to
thee, love,
In the dreamy
old garden of
John's.


By Jove! What
a time we just
had, love,
That week you
were up for ',
Com mem.!
The dances and
picnics — egad,
love,
How strange
to be thinking
of them!
How we laughed at the dusty old doctors,
And the Vice with his gorgeous gold gown,
And you thought it a shame that the Proctors
Were constantly sending me down.
We danced and we dined and we boated,
Did the lions all quite comnie ilfaut,
And I felt a strange thrill when you voted
Old JOHNNIE'S the best of the show.
I remember your eager delight, love,
With our garden and chapel and hall—
And oh, for that glorious night, love,
When we went to the Balliol ball!
There is very poor pleasure in dancing
In a stuffv hot ball-room in June-^-
And the Balliol lawn looked entrancing
In the silvery light of the moon.
I fancy the thought had occurred, love.
To somebody else besides me,
For I managed, with scarcely a word, love,
To get you to smile and agree.
We sat on the Balliol lawn, love,
And the hours flew as fast as you please,
Till the rosy-tipped fingers of dawn, love,
Crept over the Trinity trees.
A stranger might say he had never
Heard trash in a vapider key;
But no conversation has ever
Been half so delicious to me.
I seemed to be walking on air, love;
And oh, how I quivered when you
Snipped off a wee lock of your hair, love.
And said you were fond of me too.
I clasped it again and again, love,
To my breast with a passionate vow.
There ever since it has lain, love,
And there it is lying just now.
—But my heart gives a horrible thump, love,
I find myself gasping for air.
For mv throat is choked up with a lump,
love,
Which surely should never be there.
And I fadly be'think me that life, Live,
Won't always run just as we will—
For you are another man's wife, love,
And I am a bachelor still
Common (Gas) Metre.
"LIGHT metres" there are many,
The lightest of the lot
Is what is called "the Penny-
-in-the-Slot!"

LYRE AND LANCET.
(A Story in Scenes.)
I'ART Vni.-SURl'RISES-AGREEABLE AND OTHERWISE.
SCENE XIII.—The Amber Boudoir. Sir RUPERT has just entered.
Sir Rupert. Ha, MAISIE, my dear, glad to see you. Well, Ro-
HESIA, how are you, eh? You 're looking uncommonly well! No
idea you were here!
Spurrell (to himself). Sir RUPERT!
pretty soon, I expect!
Lady Cantire (agnrieved). We have been in the house for the best
part of an hour, RUPERT—as you might have discovered by inquir-
ing—but no doubt you preferred your comfort to welcoming a guest
who was merely your sister!
Sir Rup. (to himself). Beginning already! (Aloud.) Very
sorry—got rather wet riding—had to change everything. And I
knew ALBINIA was here.
Lady Cant, (magnanimously). Well, we won't begin to quarrel
the moment we meet • and you are forgetting your other guest.
(In an undertone.) Mr. SPURRELL—the Poet—wrote Andromeda.
(Aloud.) Mr. SPUBRELL, come and let me present
you to my brother.
Sir Rup. Ah, how d'ye do? (To himself, as lie
shakes hands.) What the deuce am I to say to this
fellow? (Aloud.) Glad to see you here, Mr. SPUR-
RELL—heard all about you—Andromeda, eh? Hope
you'll manage to amuse yourself while you're with
us; afraid there's not much you can do note though.
Spurr. (to himself). Horse in a bad way; time
they let me see it. (Aloud.) Well, we must see,
Sir: I'll do all I can.
Sir Rup. You see, the shooting's done now.
Spurr. (to himself, professionally piqued). They
might have waited till I 'd seen the horse before thev
shot him! After calling me in like this! (Aloud.)
Oh, I 'm sorry to hear that, Sir RUPERT. I wish I
could have got here earlier, I 'm sure.
<Si> Rup. Wish we 'd asked you a month ago, if
you're fond of shooting. Thought you might look
down on Sport, perhaps.
Spurr. (to himself). Sport? Why, he's talking of
birds—not the horse! (Aloud.) Me, Sir RUPERT?
Not much! I 'm as keen on a day's gunning as any
man, though I don't often get the chance now.
Sir Rup. (to himself,pleased). Come, he don't seem
strong against the Game Laws! (Aloud.) Thought
vou didn't look as if you sat over your desk all day!
There's hunting still, of course. Don't know whether
you ride?
Spurr. Rather so, Sir! Why, I was born and
bred in a sporting county, and as long as my old
uncle was alive. I could go down to his farm and get
a run with the hounds now and again.
Sir Rup. (delighted). Capital! Well, our next
meet is on Tuesday—best part of the country; nearly
all grass, and nice clean post and rails. You must
stay over for it. Got a mare that will carry your
weight perfectly, and I think I can promise you a
run—eh, what do you say?
Spurr. (to himself, in surprise). He is a chummy
old cock! I '11 wire old SPAVIN that I 'm detained on biz; and I '11
tell'em to send my riding-breeches down! (Aloud.) It's uncom-
monly kind of you, Sir, and I think I can manage to stop on a bit.
Lady Culrerin (to herself). RUPERT must be out of his senses! It's
bad enough to have him here till Monday! (Aloud.) We mustn't
forget, RUPERT, how valuable Mr. SPURRELL'S time is; it would
be too selfish of us to detain him here a day longer than
Lady Cant. My dear, Mr. SPURRELL has already said he can
manage it; so we may all enjoy his society with a clear conscience.

Sir Rup. No luggage, eh? Well, well, it's of no consequence.
But I '11 ask about it—I daresay it's all right. [He goes out.
Captain Thicknesse (to SPUHRELL). Sure to have turned up, you
know—man will have seen to that. Shouldn't altogether object to a
glass of sherry and bitters before dinner. Don't know how you feel
—suppose you 've a soul abore sherry and bitters, though?
Spurr. Not at this moment. But I 'd soon put my soul above a
sherry and bitters if I got a chance!
Capt. Thick, (after reflection). I say, you know, that's rather

stuck up-—not half a bad sort, if he is a bit of a bounder. (Aloud.)
Anythin' in the evenin' paper? Don't get 'em down here.
Spurr. Nothing much. I see there s an objection to Monkey-
tricks for the Grand National.
Capt. Thick, (interested). No, by Jove! Hope they won't carry it

Spurr. I wouldn't back him myself. I know something that's
safe to win, bar accidents—a dead cert, Sir! Got the tip straight
from the stables. You just take my advice, and pile all you can on
Jumping Joan.
Capt. Thick, (later, to himself, after a long and highly interesting
conrersation). 'fhunderin' clever chap —never knew

Sir Rup. Take you up now, if you like, Mr. SPURRELL—it's only
just seven, though. Suppose you don't take an hour to dress, eh?
Spurr. Oh dear no, Sir, nothing like it! (To himself.) Won't
take me two minutes as I am now! I 'd better tell him—I can say
my bag hasn't come. I don't believe it has, and, any way, it's a good

SOCIETY FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF LITERATURE
THE first annual meeting of this society, which, as our readers will
remember, has been in process of formation for some years past, was
held yesterday. We cannot congratulate the society on its decision
to exclude reporters. It
is true that our represen-
sJsX tative, on seeking admis-
sion, was informed that
his presence would be un-
necessary, as members of
the society, having for
some time past done their
own reviewing, intended
for the future to report
themselves. The public,
however, whose eager in-
terest in literature is
sufficiently attested not
only by the literary page
of democratic news-
papers, but by the columns which even reactionary journals devote
to higher criticism and literary snippets—the public, we say, will
pot brook this absurd plea, and will refuse to accept any but an
impartial report of a gathering such as was held yesterday. This
we have obtained, and we now proceed to publish it for the benefit
of the world.
The meeting opened with a prayer of two thousand words specially
written for the occasion by Mr. RICHARD L- G-LLI-NNE in collabora-
tion with Mr. ROBERT B-rn-N-N. As this is shortly to be published
in the form of a joint letter to the Daily Chronicle it is only
necessary to say at present that it combines vigour of expression
with delicacy of sentiment and grace of style in the very highest
degree. By the way, we may mention that the new Prayer-book of
the Society is to be published by Messrs. E-K-.V M-mi-ws and J-HN
L-XE, at the " Bodley Head," before the end of the year. It will be
profusely illustrated by Messrs. A-IIR-Y B-ABD-L-V and W-LT-R
S-CK-KT, who have also designed for it a special fancy cover. Only
three hundred copies will be issued. To return, however, to the
meeting.
Afterharmony had been restored, Mr. W-LT-R B-S-NT asked leave
to say a few words. His remarks, in which he was understood to
advocate the compulsory expropriation of publishers, were at first
listened to with favour. Happening incautiously to say a word or
two in praise of a Mr. DICKENS and a Mr. THACKEBAY he was groaned
down after a sturdy struggle. Mr. DICKENS and Mr. THACKERAY
were not, we understand, present in the room at the time.
Mr. H-B-RT CH-CK-NTH-BPE rose and denounced the previous
speaker. Literature, he declared, must be vague. What was the
use of knowing what you were driving at? What was the use of
more than he could help, and he could assure the meeting that he
could help a great deal; yes, he could help his fellow-creatures to a
right understanding of the value of patchwork and jerks. That was
the religion of humanity.
Mr. N-RM-N G-LE said he wasn't much good speaking, but he
could do something in the dairy and orchard style. He then gave
the following example:—
Enter CELIA, robed in white,
CELIA 's been a-milking.
CELIA daily doth indite
Praises to the Pill-king.
CELIA'S flocks and CELIA'S herds
(Only she can teach "em)
All produce their cream and curds,
Helped by Mr. B-CH-JI.
A loud cheer greeted the recital of this charming pastoral, and one
editor, who is not often a victim to mere sentiment, said it reminded
him of his happy childhood, when he used to take Dr. GREGORY'S
powders after a day spent in the neighbouring farmer's orchard.
The next shaker was G-OBGE EG-RT-N. All women, she said,
must be GEORGES. GEORGE SAND and GEOBGE ELIOT were women
she believed. GEORGE MEREDITH was an exception, but that only
proved her rule. Women were a miserable lot: it was their own
fault. Why marry? ("Hear, hear," from Mrs. MONA CAIBD.) Why
be born at all? She paused for a reply.
At this point Mr. W. T. ST-AD entered the room and offered to talk
about " JULIA in Chicago," but the meeting broke up in confusion,
without the customary vote of thanks to the Chair.

HOW IT WILL BE DONE HEREAFTER,
(A Serene Ducal Romance of the Future.)
His Highness was smoking a pipe at the close of the day in the
fair realm of Utopia. He had finished dinner, and was discussing
his lager beer, which
had quite taken the
place of coffee.
"Dear me," said
the Duke, rather r^!f /•$ '3)*
anxiously, as he no- X^Mi W$L
ticed the Premier was
seating himself in a
chair in his near
neighbourhood; "I
am afraid I am in-
disgrace."
"Not at all, Sir,'1
replied the Minister,
graciously. "On the
contrary, in the name
of thepeopleof Utopia,
I beg to offer you my
sincere thanks."
"For what? "que-
ried the Duke.
"For doing your duty, my liege. Not that that is a novelty, for,
as a matter of fact, you are always doing it."
"I am pleased to hear you say so," observed His Highness; "as I
was under the impression that I had rather shirked my engagements."
"Not at all, Sir—not at all. If you consult your memory, you
will find you carried out to-day's programme to the letter."
"Had I not to lay a foundation stone, or something, this morning "f"
"Assuredly; and you touched a cord as you were getting up, and
immediately the machinery was set in motion, and the stone was duly
laid. Much better than driving miles to have to stand in a drafty
marquee."
"And had I not to open an exhibition?"
"Why, yes. And you opened it in due course. Your equerry repre-
sented you and ground out your speech from the portable phonograph."
"Well, really, that was very ingenious," remarked His Highness-'.
"But was I not missed?"
"You would have been. Sir," returned the Premier, "had we not
had the forethought to send down the lantern that gives you in a
thousand different attitudes. By revolving the disc rapidly the
most life-like presentment was offered immediately."
"Excellent! and did I do anything else?"
"Why your Highness has been hard at work all day attending
reviews, opening canals, and even presiding at public dinners.
Thanks to science we can reproduce your person, your speech, your
very presence at a moment's notice."
Exceedingly clever!" exclaimed His Highness. "Ah, how much
better is the twentieth century than its predecessor!"
And no doubt the sentiment of His Highness will be approved by
anyone knowing anything? Personally he didn't mean to know
posterity.

SCENE XIII.—The Amber Boudoir. Sir RUPERT has just entered.
Sir Rupert. Ha, MAISLE, my dear, glad to see you. "Well, Ro-
HESIA, how are you, eh? You're looking uncommonly well! No
idea you were here!
Spurrell (to himself). Sir RUPERT! He'll have me out of this
pretty soon, I expect!
Lady Cantii-e (aggrieved). We have been in the house for the best
part of an hour, RUPERT—as you might have discovered by inquir-
ing—but no doubt you preferred your comfort to welcoming a guest
who was merely your sister!
Sir Hup. (to himself). Beginning already! (Aloud.) Very
sorry—got rather wet riding—had to change everything. And I
knew ALBINIA was here.
Lady Cant, (magnanimously). Well, we won't begin to quarrel
the moment we meet; and you are forgetting your other guest.
(In an undertone.) Mr. SPURRELL—the Poet—wrote Andromeda.
(Aloud.} Mr. SPURRELL, come and let me present
you to my brother.
Sir Hup. Ah, how d'ye do? (To himself, as fie
shakes hands.) What the deuce am I to say to this
fellow? (Aloud.) Glad to see you here, Mr. SPVE-
RELI,—heard all about you—Andromeda, eh? Hope
you '11 manage to amuse yourself while you 're with
us • afraid there's not much you can do now though.
Spurr. (to himself). Horse in a bad way; time
they let me see it. (Aloud.) Well, we must see,
Sir: I'11 do all/can.
Sir Sup. You see, the shooting's done now.
Spurr. (to himself, professionally piqued). They
might have waited till I 'd seen the horse before thev
shot him! After calling me in like this! (Aloud.)
Oh, I 'm sorry to hear that. Sir RUPERT. I wis-h I
could have got here earlier, I 'ra sure.
Sir Rup. Wish we'd asked you a month ago, if
you're fond of shooting. Thought you might look
down on Sport, perhaps.
Spurr. (to himself). Sport? Why, he's talking of
birds—not the horse! (Aloud.) Me, Sir RUPERT?
Not murk! I 'm as keen on a day's gunning as any
man, though I don't often get the chance now.
Sir Rup. (to himself, pleased). Come, he don't seem
strong against the Game Laws! (Aloud.) Thought
vou didn't look as if you sat over your desk all day!
There's hunting still, of course. Don't know whether
you ride?
Spurr. Rather so, Sir! Why, I was born and
bred in a sporting county, and as long as my old
uncle was alive. I could go down to his farm and get
a run with the hounds now and again.
Sir Rup. (delighted). Capital! Well, our next
meet is on Tuesday—best part of the country; nearly
all grass, and nice clean post and rails. You must
stay over for it. Got a marc that will carry your
weight perfectlv, and I Ihink I can promise you a
run—eh, what do you say?
Spurr. (to himself, in surprise). He is a chummy
old cock! I '11 wire old SPAVIN that I 'm detained on biz: and I '11
tell'em to send my riding-breeches down! (Aloud.) It s uncom-
monly kind of you, Sir, and I think I can manage to stop on a bit.
Lady Culrerin (to herself). RUPERT must be out of his senses! It's
bad enough to have him here till Monday! (Aloud.) We mustn't
forget, RUPERT, how valuable Mr. SPURRELL'S time is; it would
be too selfish of us to detain him here a day longer than
Lady Cant. My dear, Mr. SPURRELL has already said he can
manage it; so we may all enjoy his society with a clear conscience.
(Lady CDI.VERIN conceals her sentiments with difficulty.) And now,
ALBINIA, if you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to my room and rest
a little, as I'm rather fatigued, and you have all these tiresome
people coming to dinner to-night.
[She riles, and leaves the room; the other ladies follow her
example.

glass of sherry and bitters before dinner. Don't know how you feel

C'ELIA'S flocks and CELIA'S herds

A loud cheer greeted the recital of this charming pastoral, and one
editor, who is not often a victim to mere sentiment, said it reminded
him of his happy childhood, when he used to take Dr. GREGORY'S
powders after a day spent in the neighbouring farmer's orchard.
The next speaker was G-ORGE EG-BT-N. All women, she said,
must be GEORGES. GEOHGE SAND and GEORGE ELIOT were women
she believed. GEOBGE MEREDITH was an exception, but that only
proved her rule. Women were a miserable lot: it was their own
fault. Why marry P ("Hear, hear," from Mrs. MONA CAIED.) Why
be born at all P She paused for a reply.
At this point Mr. W. T. ST-AD entered the room and offered to talk
about " JDLIA in Chicago," but the meeting broke up in confusion,
without the customary vote of thanks to the Chair.

HOW IT WILL BE DONE HEREAFTER.
(A Serene Ducal Romance of the Fu/ure.)
His Highness was smoking a pipe at the close of the day in the
fair realm of Utopia. He had finished dinner, and was discussing
his lager beer, which
had quite taken the
place of coffee.
"Dear me," said
the Duke, rather
anxiously, as he no-
ticed the Premier was
seating himself in a
chair in his near
neighbourhood; "I
am afraid I am in-
disgrace."
"Not at all, Sir,'1
replied the Minister,
graciously. "On the
contrary, in the name
ofthepeopleof Utopia,
I beg to offer you my
sincere thanks."
"For what? "que-
ried the Duke.
"For doing your duty, my liege. Not that that is a novelty, for,
as a matter of fact, you are always doing it."
"I am pleased to hear you sav so," observed His Highness; "as I
was under the impression that I had rather shirked my engagements."
"Xot at all, Sir—not at all. If you consult your memory, you
will find you carried out to-day's programme to the letter."
"Had I not to lay a foundation stone, or something, this morning!'"
"Assuredly; and you touched a cord as you were getting up, and
immediately the machinery was set in motion, and the stone was duly
laid. Much better than driving miles to have to stand in a drafty
marquee."
"And had I not to open an exhibition?"
Why, yes. And you opened it in due course. Your equerry repre-
sented you and ground out your speech from the portable phonograph."
"Well, really, that was very ingenious," remarked His Highness.
"But was I not missed?"
"You would have been. Sir," returned the Premier, "had we not
had the forethought to send down the lantern that gives you in a
thousand different attitudes. By revolving the ditc rapidly the
most life-like presentment was offered immediately."
"Excellent! and did I do anything else?"
"Why your Highness has been hard at work all day attending
reviews, opening canals, and even presiding at public dinners.
Thanks to science we can reproduce your person, your speech, your
verypresenpe at a moment's notice."
Exceedingly clever!" exclaimed His Highness. "Ah, how much
better is the twentieth century than its predecessor!"
And no doubt the sentiment of His Highness will be approved by
anyone knowing anything? Personally he didn't mean to know
posterity.

There's hunting still, of course. Don't know whether
you ride?
Spurr. Rather so, Sir! Why, I was born and
bred in a sporting county, and as long as my old
uncle was alive. I could go down to his farm and get
a run with the hounds now and again.

SOCIETY FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF LITERATURE
THE first annual meeting of this society, which, as our readers will
remember, has been in process of formation for some years past, was
held yesterday. We cannot congratulate the society on its decision
to exclude reporters. It
is true that our represen-
tative, on seeking admis-
sion, was informed that
his presence would be un-
necessary, as members of
the society, having for
\ N\3HH& '^o^A-—_ \>\x?, .' ',--1 80me t™6 P?8* d?ne *neir
own reviewing, intended
for the future to report
themselves. The public,
however, whose eager in-
-•OUUIUiuai^MKIteZ^jcr terest in literature is
sufficiently attested not
only by the literary page
of democratic news-
papers, but by the columns which even reactionary journals devote
to higher criticism and literary snippets—the public, we say, will
not brook this absurd plea, and will refuse to accept any but an
impartial report of a gathering such as was held yesterday. This
we have obtained, and we now proceed to publish it for the benefit
of the world.
The meeting opened with a prayer of two thousand words specially
written for the occasion by Mr. RICHAED L- G-LLI-NNE in collabora-
tion with Mr. ROBERT B-rn-N-N. As this is shortly to be published
in the form of a joint letter to the Daily Chronicle it is only
necessarv to say at present that it combines vigour of expression
with delicacy of sentiment and grace of style in the very highest
degree. By the way, we may mention that the new Prayer-book of
the Society is to be published by Messrs. E-K-X M-TTH-WS and J-HN
L-NE, at the " Bodley Head," before the end of the year. It will be
profusely illustrated by Messrs. A-BR-Y B-AHD-L-Y and W-LT-R
S-CK-RT, who have also designed for it a special fancy cover. Only
three hundred copies will be issued. To return, however, to the
meeting.
After harmony had been restored, Mr. W-LT-R B-S-NT asked leave
to say a few words. His remarks, in which he was understood to
advocate the compulsory expropriation of publishers, were at first
listened to with favour. Happening incautiously to fay a word or
two in praise of a Mr. DICKENS and a Mr. THACKEBAY he was groaned
down after a sturdy struggle. Mr. DICKENS and Mr. THACKERAY
were not, we understand, present in the room at the time.
Mr. H-B-ET CR-CK-NTH-BPE rose and denounced the previous
speaker. Literature, he declared, must be vague. What was the
use of knowing what you were driving at? What was the use of
more than he could help, and he could assure the meeting that he
could help a great deal; yes, he could help his fellow-creatures to a
right understanding of the value of patchwork and jerks. That was
the religion of humanity.
Mr. N-BM-N G-LE said he wasn't much good speaking, but he
could do something in the dairy and orchard style. He then gave
the following example :—
Enter CELIA, robed in white,
CELIA 's been a-milking.
CELIA daily doth indite
Praises to the Pill-king.
CELIA'S flocks and CELIA'S herds
(OnJy she can teach 'em)
All produce their cream and curd*,
Helped by Mr. B-CH-M.
A loud cheer greeted the recital of this charming pastoral, and one
editor, who is not often a victim to mere sentiment, said it reminded
him of his happy childhood, when he used to take Dr. GREGORY'S
powders after a day spent in the neighbouring farmer's orchard.
The next speaker was G-OROE EG-RT-N. All women, she said,
must be GEORGES. GEORGE SAND and GEORGE ELIOT were women
she believed. GEORGE MEREDITH was an exception, but that only
proved her rule. Women were a miserable lot: it was their own
fault. Why marry? ("Hear, hear," from Mrs. MONA CAIKD.) Why
be born at all? She paused for a reply.
At this point Mr. W. T. ST-AD entered the room and offered to talk
about " JULIA in Chicago," but the meeting broke up in confusion,
without the customary vote of thanks to the Chair.

HOW IT WILL BE DONE HEREAFTER.

fair realm of Utopia. He had finished dinner, and was discussing
his lager beer, which
had quite taken the
place of coffee.

"Excellent! and did I do anything else?"

very presence at a moment's notice."
Exceedingly clever!" exclaimed His Highness. "Ah, how much
better is the twentieth century than its predecessor!"
And no doubt the sentiment of His Highness will be approved by
anyone knowing anything? Personally he didn't mean to know
posterity.

SOCIETY FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF LITERATURE
THE first annual meeting of this society, which, as our readers will
remember, has been in process of formation for some years past, was
held yesterday. We cannot congratulate the society on its decision
to exclude reporters. It
is true that our represen-
tative, (in seeking admis-
sion, was informed that
his presence would be un-
necessary, as members of
the society, having for
some time past done their
own reviewing, intended
for the future to report
themselves. The public,
however, whose eager in-
terest in literature is
sufficiently attested not
only by the literary page
of democratic news-
papers, but by the columns which even reactionary journals devote
to higher criticism and literary snippets—the public, we say, will
not brook this absurd plea, and will refuse to accept any but an
impartial report of a gathering such as was held yesterday. This
we have obtained, and we now proceed to publish it for the benefit
of the world.
The meeting opened with a prayer of two thousand words specially
written for the occasion by Mr. RICHAHD L- G-LLI-NNE in collabora-
tion with Mr. ROBERT B-rn-N-N. As this is shortly to be published
in the form of a joint letter to the Daily Chronicle it is only
necessary to say at present that it combines vigour of expression
with delicacy of sentiment and grace of style in the very highest
degree. By the way, we may mention that the new Prayer-book of
the Society is to be published by Messrs. E-K-X M-TTII-WS and J-HN
L-XE, at the " Bodley Head," before the end of the year. It will be
profusely illustrated by Messrs. A-BR-Y B-AHD-L-Y and W-LT-R
S-CK-RT, who have also designed for it a special fancy cover. Only
three hundred copies will be issued. To return, however, to the
meeting.
After harmony had been restored, Mr. W-LT-R B-S-NT asked leave
to say a few words. His remarks, in which he was understood to
advocate the compulsory expropriation of publishers, were at first
listened to with favour. Happening incautiously to say a word or
two in praise of a Mr. DICKENS and a Mr. THACKERAY he was groaned
down after a sturdy struggle. Mr. DICKENS and Mr. THACKERAY
were not, we understand, present in the room at the time.
Mr. H-B-RT CR-CK-NTH-HPE rose and denounced the previous
speaker. Literature, he declared, must be vague. What was the
use of knowing what you were driving at? What was the use of
more than he could help, and he could assure the meeting that he
could help a great deal; yes, he could help his fellow-creatures to a
right understanding of the value of patchwork and jerks. That was
the religion of humanity.
Mr. N-RM-N G-LE said he wasn't much good speaking, but he
could do something in the dairy and orchard style. He then gave
the following example:—
Enter CF.LIA, robed in white,
CELIA '» been a-milking.
CELIA daily doth indite
Praises to the Pill-king.
CELIA'S flocks and CEUA'S herds
(Only she can teach 'cm)
All produce their cream and curds,
Helped by Mr. B-CH-M.
A loud cheer greeted the recital of this charming pastoral, and one
editor, who is not often a victim to mere sentiment, said it reminded
him of his happy childhood, when he used to take Dr. GREGORY'S
powders after a day spent in the neighbouring farmer's orchard.
The next speaker was G-ORGE EG-RT-N. All women, she said,
must be GEORGES. GEORGE SAND and GEORGE ELIOT were women
she believed. GEORGE MEREDITH was an exception, but that only
proved her rule. Women were a miserable lot: it was their own
fault. Why marry? ("Hear, hear," from Mrs. MONA CAIRO.) Why
be born at all? She paused for a reply.
At this point Mr. W. T. ST-AD entered the room and offered to talk
about " JULIA in Chicago," but the meeting broke up in confusion,
without the customary vote of thanks to the Chair.
.

HOW IT WILL BE DONE HEREAFTER.
(A Serene Ducal Jiomance of the Future.)
His Highness was smoking a pipe at the close of the day in the
fair realm of Utopia. He had finished dinner, and was discussing
his lager beer, which
had quite taken the
place of coffee. >^IVk
"Dear me," said
the Duke, rather
anxiously, as he no-
ticed the Premier was
seating himself in a
chair in his near
neighbourhood; "I
am afraid I am in-
disgrace."
"Not at all, Sir/'
replied the Minister,
graciously. "On the
contrary, in the name
of thepeopleof Utopia,
I beg to offer you my
sincere thanks."
"For what? "que-
ried the Duke.
"For doing your duty, my liege. Not that that is a novelty, for,
as a matter of fact, you are always doing it."
"I am pleased to hear you say so," observed His Highness; "as I
was under the impression that I had rather shirked my engagements."
"Not at all, Sir—not at all. If you consult your memory, you
will find you carried out to-day's programme to the letter."
"Had I not to lay a foundation stone, or something, this morning''"
"Assuredly; and you touched a cord as you were getting up, and
immediately the machinery was set in motion, and the stone was duly
laid. Much better than driving miles to have to stand in a drafty
marquee."
"And had I not to open an exhibition?"
"Why, yes. And you opened it in due course. Your equerry repre-
sented you and ground out your speech from the portable phonograph."
"Well, really, that was very ingenious," remarked His Highness.
"But was I not missed?"
"You would have been. Sir," returned the Premier, "had we not
had the forethought to send down the lantern that gives you in a
thousand different attitudes. By revolving the disc rapidly the
most life-like presentment was offered immediately."
"Excellent! and did I do anything else?"
"Why your Highness has been hard at work all day attending
reviews, opening canals, and even presiding at public dinners.
Thanks to science we can reproduce your person, your speech, your
very presence at a moment's notice."
Exceedingly clever!" exclaimed His Highness. "Ah, how much
better is the twentieth century than its predecessor!"
And no doubt the sentiment of His Highness will be approved by
anyone knowing anything? Personally he didn't mean to know
posterity.

TO A WOULD-BE AUTHORESS.
THOUGH, MAUD, I respect your ambition,
I fear, to be brutally plain,
No proud and exalted position
^ our stories are likely to gain;

And, frankly, I cannut pretend I
Regard with the smallest delight
The vile cacoHhes scribexdi
Which led you to write.
Your talk is most charming, I know it,
You readily fascinate all,
But yet as a serious poet
Your worth, I 'm afraid, is but small;
Your features, though well-nigh perfection,
Of the obstacle hardly dispose
That vou haven't the faintest conception
Of how to write prose!
You think it would be so delightful
To see your productions in print'(
Well, do not consider me spiteful
For daring discreetly to hint
That in this too-crowded profession,
Where prizes are fewer than blanks,
You '11 find the laconic expression,
"Rejected—with thanks."
And so, since you do me the pleasure
To ask for my candid advice,
Allow for your moments of leisure
Some other pursuit to suffice;
And, if you would really befriend me,
One wish I will humbly confess,—
Oh, do not continue to send me
Those reams of MS.!
A MODERN TRAGEDY.
Om hostess told us off in pairs,
I had not caught my partner's name,
But learned, when half way down the stairs,
She long had been a Primrose Dame;
And, ere the soup was out of sight,
She'd found, and left behind, her text on
A speech, if I remember right,
Attributed to Mr. SEXTOX.
And I—I sat and gasped awhile,
And only when we reached the pheasant,
Assuming my politest smile.
And with an air distinctly pleasant,
Attempted firmly to direct
Her flow of talk to other channels.
Books—shops—the latest stage-effect—
The newest ways of painting panels.
I tried in vain. "Ah, yes," she said,
"And that reminds me—this Dissent"—
And thereupon began, instead,
The case was clearly hopeless, so
I hazarded no more suggestions,
But merely answered Yes or No
At random, to her frequent questions.
Yet, while that gushing torrent ran,
I made a solemn private vow
That, though no ardent partisan.
Those Ministers I '11 vote for now
Who '11 introduce a drastic bill
To bring about her abolition,
To banish utterly, or kill
The modern ladv-'x>litician!
THE OYSTER AND THE SPARROW.
A Pessimistic Tale.
AT Whitstable one summer day,
An oyster gave his fancy wings;
He very indolently lay
In bed, and thought of many things;
Of what his life had been; of weeks
All spent in having forty winks—
You know an oyster never speaks.
But lies awake in bed, and thinks.
He thought, with pardonable pride,
That he had never worked—a plan
Which showed, it cannot be denied,
That he was quite a gentleman.
He lived more calmly in his sea
Than any Bishop; never crossed
In any sort of wishes, he
Had never loved, and never lost.
No cruel maid had ever spurned
His heart, such grief no oyster knows;
Nor hatred ever in him burned
a> Against the rival whom she chose.

Yet, when considered, all appeared
Too softly calm, too free from strife;
He thought, and, sighing, stroked his
beard,
"There does not seem much use in life."
By chance, upon this very day
A London sparrow, for a minute,
Was thinking somewhat in this way
Of life, and what the deuce was in it,
And how he ituttered up and down,
Like Berthas, Doras, Trunks, or Yankees—
His nest was far above the town.
Upon the buildings known as Hankey's.
He thought, with pardonable pride,
Unlike a pampered, gay canary,
He worked—it cannot be denied
That " Laborare est orare."
He worked with all his might and main.
Yet now he chirped with some misgiving,
"Shoot me if I know what I gain,
There does not seem much use in living."
Soon after this the bird and fish
Were slain by old, relentless foes,
When death was near, each seemed to wish
The bird was knocked upon the head—
A crack no gluing could repair;
The oyster rudely dragged from bed.
Died from exposure to the air.
They helped in one great work, at least,
To make some greedy beings fat;
The oyster graced a City feast,
The bird was eaten by the cat.

Thus, though they led such different lives,
One fat from sloth, from work one
thinner,
Their end was that for which man strives.
And mostly ends his days with—dinner!
VERSES TO THE WEATHER MAIDEN.
LADY, the best and brightest of the sex,
Whose smile we value, and whose frown
we fear,
Let ine proclaim the miseries that vex
The numerous throng who all esteem you
dear-
'Tis not that you habitualV ippear
Serenely contemplating the Atl intic
In raiment which, if fa'hicnible h<re,
Would greatly shock the properly pedantic,
Make Glasgow green with rage, and Mrs.
GliimDy frantic;
Your classical costume a true delight is
To all who study you from day_ to day,
And even if it hastens on bronchitis
It serves your graceful figure to display:
But now your thousand fond admirers
pray
Amid the tumult of the London traffic
And in each rural unfrequented way—
"0 weather-goddess, look with smile
seraphic
And prophesy 'Set Fair' within the Daily
Graphic!"
Too long, too long, each worshipper relates,
You've told of woe with melancholy
glance,
Predicted new "depresions" from the
States,
Or" V-shapcd cyclones" nearing us from
France;
Our summer flies, oh, herald the advance
Of decent weather ere its course be ended,
Put your umbrella down, and if by
chance
PJKCATOR grumble, let him go unfriended,
Heed not his selfish moan, but give us
sunshine splendid!
Our confidence towards you never flinches,
Let others be unceasingly employed
In working out the barometric inches,
Or tapping at the fickle aneroid,
Wet bulb and dry we equally avoid,
In you, and you alone, our hopes remain,
Then be not by our forwardness annoyed.
Nor let our supplications rise in vain,—
Ob, Daily Graphic maid, smile, smile on us
Discusssing' Disestablishment!

How worry particklar sum peeple is in having it advertised where
they have gone to to ppend their summer holliday. I wunce saw it
stated, sum years ago, that the Markis of SOBLSBEBBY had gone with
the Marchoness to Deep, I think it was, and then follered the
staggering annowncement that Mr. Deputy MUGGINS
and Mrs. MUGGINS was a spending a hole week at
Gravesend I I 'm a having mine at Grinnidge, and
had the honner last week of waiting upon the
Ministerial Gents from Westminster, and a worry
jowial lot of Gents they suttenly seems to be.
I likes Grinnidge somehow; it brings back to fond!
memmory the appy days when I fust proposed to my i
Misses ROBERT in Grinnidge Park, and won from her
blushing lips a.fond awowal of her living detachment
for me!
Ah! them was appy days, them was, and
never cums more than wunoe to us; no, not ewen
in Grinnidge Park.
I 'm fold as how as Appy Amsted is not at all a bad place for this
sort of thing; but I cannot speak from werry much pussonal
xperience there myself.
Having a nour or two to spare befo: e the Westminster Dinner, I
took a strol in the butiful Park. Not quite the place for adwenters,
but I had a little one there on that werry particklar day as I shant
soon forget.
I was a setting down werry oumferal on a nice cumfernl seat, when
a nice looking Lady came up to me, and setting herself down beside
me asked me werv quietly it I coud lend her such a thing as harf a
crown! I was that estonished that I ardly know what to say,
when to my great surprise she bust out a crying, and told me as
how as she had bin robbed, and had not a penny to take her home
to London! What on airth coud I do? I ooudn't say as I hadn't
no hirf crown coz I had one, and I curnt werry well ttll a hun-

was the only one as I had, and so I hoped as she woud return it to

her arms round my neck and acshally kist me, and then got up
and ran away! and I have lived ever since in a dredful state of

THE NEXT WAR.
(Fragment from a Romance of the Future.)
TnB successful General, after winning the great victory, acted
with decision. He cut all the telegraph wires with his own hands,
until there was but one left in the camp—that which had its outlet
in his own tent. He called for the special cor-
respondents. They came reluctantly, writing
in their note-books as they approached him.
"Gentlemen," said he, with polite severity,
"I have no wish to deal harshly with the Press.
I am fully aware of the services it does to the
country. But, gentlemen, I have a duty to
perform. I cannot allow you to communicate
to your respective editors the glorious result of
this day's fighting. For a couple of hours you
must be satisfied to restrain your impatience."
"It will yet be in time for the five o'clock
edition," murmured one of the scribes.
"And I shall be able to get it into the
Special," murmured another.
Then the General bowed and retired to his
own tent. At last he was alone. Over the re-
ceiver to the telephone was a board inscribed
with various numbers, with names attached
thereto. He saw that 114 stood for ""Wife," 12,017 for "Mother-
in-law," and 10 f jr " Junior United Service Club." But he selected
none of these.
"No. 7," he cried, suddenly applying his lips to the receiver and
ringing up, "are you there?"
"Why, certainly; what shall I do i"'
"Why. buy 30,000 Consols for me," was the prompt reply. And
then the General a few minutes later added, "Have you done it '<"
"I have—for the next account."
And then the warrior smiled and released the Press-men. Nay,
more, he ordered the telegraph wires to bo repaired. All was joy
and satisfaction. The glorious news was flashed in a thousand
different directions. The name of the general received immediate
immortality.
And the great commander was more than satisfied. His fortune
was assured. Before allowing the news to be spread abroad he had

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTBACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Lords. Monday, August 13.—Sorry I didn't hear the
Duke of AKOTLL. Have been told he is one of finest orators in House;
a type of the antique; something to be cherished and honoured.
"Were you ever," BARK asked, " at Oban when the games were
going on? Very well then, you would see the contest among the
pipers. You have watched them strutting up and down with head
thrown back, toes turned out, cheeks extended, and high notes thrill-
ing through the shrinking air. There you have Duke of ARGYLL—
God bless him!—addressing House of Lords. He is not one piper,
but many. As he proceeds, intoxicated with sound of his own voice,
ecstatic in clearness of his own vision, he competes with himself as
the pipers struggle with each other until at last he has, in a Parlia-
mentary sense of course, swollen to such a size that there is no room
in_the stately chamber for other Peers. Nothing and nobody left but
His Grace the Duke of ARGYLL. Towards end of sixty minutes
spectacle begins to pall on wearied senses; but to begin with, it is
almost sublime. For thirty-two years, he told ROSEBEKY just now,
he had sat on the opposite benches, a Member of the Liberal Party.
He sat elsewhere now, but why? Because he was the Liberal Party;
all the rest like sheep had gone astray. Pretty to see the MARKISS
with blushing head downcast when ARGYLL turned round to him and,
with patronising tone and manner, hailed him and his friends as the
only party with whom a true Liberal might collogue. In some cir-
cumstances, this bearing would be insupportably bumptious. In the
Duke, with the time limit hinted at, it is delightful. He really nn-
feignedly believes it all. Sometimes in the dead unhappy night,
when the rain is on the roof (not an uncommon thing in Inverary) he
thinks in sorrow rather than in anger of multitudes of men hopelessly
in the wrong; that is to say, who differ from his view on particular
subjects at given times."
Business done.—Second Reading of Evicted Tenants Bill moved in
Tuesday.—For awhile last night, whilst LANSDOWNE (.peaking,
CLANRICARDE sat on rear Cross Bench immediately in front of Bar
where mere Commoners are permitted to stand. Amongst them at
this moment were TIM HEALY, O'BRIEN, and SEXTON, leaning over
rail to catch LANSDOWNE'S remarks. Before them, almost within
hand reach, certainlv approachable at arm's length with a gotd
shillalegh. was the bald pate of the man who, from some points of
view, is The Irish Question. CLAHRICARDK sat long unconscious of
the proximity. SARK, not usually a squeamish person, after breath-
lessly watching this strange suggestive contiguity, moved hastily
away. This is a land of law ana order. Differences, if they exist,
are settled bj; judicial processes. But human nature, especially
Celtic nature, is weak. The bald pate rested so conveniently on the
edge of the bench. It was so near; it had schemed so much for the
undoing of hapless friends in Ireland. What if * * *
To-night CLANRFCARDE instinctively moved away from this
locality. Discovered on back bench below gangway, from which safe
quarter he delivered speech, showing how olessed is the lot of the
light-hearted peasant on what he called " my campaign estates."
The MARKISS and CLANRICARDE rose together. It was ten o'clock,
the hour appointed for Leader of Opposition to interpose; in anticipa-
tion of that event the House crowded from floor to side galleries gar-
landed with fair ladies. Privy Councillors jostled each other on steps of
Throne; at the Bar stood the Commons closely packed; TIM HEALY,
anxious not again to be led into temptation, deserted this quarter;
surveyed scene from end of Gallery over the Bar. The MAEKISS
stood for a moment at the table manifestly surprised that any should
question his right to speak. According to Plan of Campaign prepared
beforehand by Whips now was his time; ROSEBERY to follow; and
Division taken so as to clear House before midnight. CLANRICARDE
recks little of Plans of Campaign: stood his ground and finally
evicted the MARKISS; cast him out by the roadside with no other
compensation than the sympathy of HALSBURY and of RUTLAND, who
sat on either side of him.

spoke to enthusiastically friendly audience.
RosEBEitY recognised in himself the represen-
tative of miserable minority of thirty; un-
daunted, undismayed, he played lightly with

of strike, WEIR gazed round angered Com-
mittee. With slowest enunciation in pro-
foundest chest notes he said, " I will tell with
the hon. Member."
Committee roared with anguished despair •
but, since procedure in case of frivolous and
vexatious Division seems forgotten by Chair,
no help for it. If there are two Members to
"tell/' House must be "told." But there
tyranny of two ceases. Yoxi may take horse
to water but cannot make him drink.
Similiarly you may divide House, but cannot
compel Members to vote with you. Thus it
came to pass that after Division CLARK and
WEIR marched up to table with confession
that they had not taken a single man into the
Ix>bby with them. They had told, but they
had nothing to tell.
"They're worse off by a moiety than the
Squire in the Canterbury Tales," said SARK—
"Him who left half told
The story of Ciimbiucan bold."
"Yes, poor needy Knife-grinders," said the
other SQUIRE; "if thev 'd only thought of it
when a^ked by the Clerk, 'How many?' they
might have answered, 'Members, Gcd bless
you, we have none to tell.'"

Butter, and eggs, and the care of bees!

And more sting than honey. Eh! Who's
Well, well, let me sing, in mellifluous tones,
The ladies have taken to speeches of late,
Butter, and eggs, and the care of bees!
Serious matter, dear friends,—for the State!
Butter, and eggs, and the care of bees!
On Female Suffrage I hardly dote,
But ladies may speak, while they have not

Of course is Home Rule—but there, nobody

THE TALE OF TWO TELEGKAMS.
ANOTHER DOLLY DIALOGUE.
(By St. Anthony Hope Carter.)
THE redeeming feature of the morning batch of letters was a short
note from Lady MICKLEHAM. Her ladyship (and ARCHIE) had come
back to town, and the note was to say that I might call, in fact that
I teas to call, that afternoon. It so happened that I had two engage-
ments, which seemed to make that impossible, but I spent a shilling
in telegrams, and at 4.30 (the hour DOLLY had named) was duly
ringing at the Miekleham town mansion.
"I 'm delighted you were able to come," was DOLLY'S greeting.
"I wasn't able," I said; "but I 've no doubt that what I said in
the two telegrams which brought me here will be put down to your
account."
"No one expects truth in a telegram. The Post-Office people
themselves wouldn't like it."
DOLLY was certainly looking at her very best. Her dimples
(everybody has heard of DOLLY'S Dimples—or is it DOLLY DIMPLE;
but after all it doesn't matter) were as delightful as ever. I was
just hesitating as to my next move in the Dialogue, which I badly
wanted, for 1 had promised my editor one by tho middle of next
week. The choice lay between the dimples and a remark that life
was, after all, only one prolonged telegram. Just at that moment I
noticed for the first time that we were not alone.
Now that was distinctly exasperating, and an unwarrantable
breach of an implied contract.
"Two's company," I said, in a tone of voice that was meant to
indicate something of what I felt.
"So's three," said DOLLY, laughing, " if the third doesn't count."
"Quod ist demonstrandum."
"Well, it's like this. I observed that you've already published

twenty or so ' Dolly Dialogues.'" (The dimples at this period were
absolutely bewitching, but I controlled myself.) "So it occurred to
me that it was my turn to earn an honest penny. Allow me to
introduce you. Mr! BROWN, Mr. CAKTER—Mr. CARTES, Mr. BROWN."
I murmured that any friend of Lady MICKLEHAM'S was a friend
of mine, whereat Mr. BROWN smiled affably and handed me his card,
from which I gathered that he was a shorthand
writer at some address in Chancerv Lane. Then
I understood it all. I had exploited DOLLY.
DOLLY was now engaged in the process of ex-
ploiting me.
"I hope," I observed rather icily, " that you
will choose a respectable paper."
"You don't mean that."
"Perhaps not. But if we are to have a
Dialogue, perhaps we might begin. I have an
engagement at six."
"Telegraph, and put the contents down to
mv account.
I noticed now that DOLLY had a pile of pa-
pers on her table, and that she was playing
with a blue pencil.
"Yes, Lady MICKLKHAM," I said, in the
provisional way in which judges indicate to
counsel that they are ready to proceed.
"Well, I've been reading some of the Press Notices of the Dia-
logues, Mr. CARTER."
I trembled. I remembered some of the things that had been said
about DOLLY and myself, which hardly lent themselves, it appeared
to me, to this third party procedure.
"I thought," pursued DOLLY, "we might spend the time in dis-
cussing the critics."
"I shall be delighted, if in doing that we shall dismiss the
reporter."
** Have you seen this? It's from a Scotch paper—Scottish P you
suggest—well, Scottish. 'The sketches are both lively and elegant,
ana their lightaess is just what people want in the warm weather.'"
"It's a satisfaction to think that even our little breezes are a
source of cool comfort to our fellow-creatures."
"Here 's another criticism. 'It's a book which tempts the
reader -'"
"It must have been something you said."
"'• a book which tempts the reader to peruse from end to
end when once he picks it up.'"
"' Read at a Sitting: A Study in Colour.'"
"Please, Mr. BROWN, don't take that down."
"Thank you, Lady MICKLEHAM," said I. "Litera scripta manet."
"You are not the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. CARTER, and
you must break yourself of the habit."
"The next cutting?"
"The next says, 'For Mr. CARTER, the hero or reporter '"
"It's a calumny. I don't know a single shorthand symbol."
"Let me go on. 'Reporter of these polite conversations, we
confess we have no particular liking.'"
"If you assure me vou did not write this yourself, Lady MICKLE-
HAM, I care not who did."
"That, Mr. BROWN," said DOLLY, in a most becoming frown,
"must on no account go down."
"When vou have finished intimidating the Press, perhaps you
will finish the extract."
"' His cynicism," " she read, " ' is too strained to commend him to
ordinary mortals '"
"No one would ever accuse you of being in that category."
"' but his wit is undeniable, and his impudence delicious.'
Well, Mr. CARTER?"
"I should like the extract concluded." I knew the next sentence
commenced—" As for DOLLY, Lady MICKLEHAM, she outdoes all the
revolted daughters of feminine fiction."
Then an annoying thing happened. ARCHIE'S voice was heard,
saying, "DOLLY, haven't you finished that Dialogue yet? We
ought to dress for dinner. It']! take us an hour to drive there."
So it had been all arranged, and AECHIE knew for what 1 had been
summoned.
Yet there are compensations. DOLLY sent the Dialogue to the only
paper which I happen to edit. I regretfully declined it. lint the
fact that she sent it may possibly explain why I have found it so
easy to give this account of what happened on that afternoon when
I sent the two telegrams.
The Cry of Chaos.
"T ivs I1 Anarchic '?"—Fools! Chaos shrieks in that cry
Did Anarchy live soon would Anarchists die.

began evening by accusing SQUIRE OP MAL-

least a dozen votes to Government in Division
that followed. Tiir HEALY, who can't abear
strong language, was one who meant to vote
against proposal to take remaining time of
Session for Ministers. After CLARK'S speech,
voted with and for the SQUIRE.
CLARK closed pleasant evening by insisting
on Division upon Statute Law Revision Bill
running through Committee.
"Will the hon. Member name a teller,"
said Chairman, blandly.
"Mr. CONYBKARE," responded CLARK, in-
stinctively thinking of Member for Camborne
as most likely to help in the job he had in
hand.
But CONYBEARE is a reformed character.
Even at his worst must draw line somewhere.

[AUGUST 25, 1894.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
to hear; every sentence a lesson in style.
Hard task for young Premier to follow so old
and so perfect a Parliamentary hand. MAHKISS
spoke to enthusiastically fnendly audience.
RosEitEiiY recognised in himself the represen-
tative of miserable minority of thirty; un-
dannted, undismayed, he played lightly with
the jxmderous personalities of ARGYLL, and
looking beyond the heads of the crowd of icily
indifferent Peers before him, seemed to see
the multitude in the street, and to hear the
murmur of angry voices.
Business done.—Lords throw out Evicted
Tenants Hill by 249 votes against 30.
Thursday, Midnight.—Spent restful even-
ing with Indian Budget. There is nothing
exceeds indignation with which Members re-
sent postponement of opportunity to consider
Indian Budget, except the unanimity with
which they stop away when it is presented.
Number present during FOWLER'S masterly
exposition not equal to one per ten million of
the population concerned. Later, CIIAPLIX
endeavoured to raise drooping spirits by few
remarks on bi-metallism. Success only par-
tial. CLARK did much better. Genially
began evening by accusing SQUIRE OF MAL-
woon of humbugging House. That worth at
least a dozen votes to Government in Division
that followed. TIM HEALY, who can't abear
strong language, was one who meant to vote
against proposal to take remaining time of
Session for Ministers. After CLARK'S speech,
voted with and for the SQCIKE.
CLARK closed pleasant evening by insisting
on Division upon Statute Law Revision Bill
running through Committee.
'' Will the hon. Member name a teller,"
said Chairman, blandly.
"Mr. COXYBKARE," responded CLARK, in-
stinctively thinking of Member for Camborne
as most likely to help in the job he had in
hand.
But CONYBEARB is a reformed character.
Even at his worst must draw line somewhere.
Drew it sharply at CLAHK. Appeared as if
game was up. On the contrary it was WEIR.
Deliberately fixing a pair of cantankerous
pince-nez that seem to be in chronic condition
of strike, WEIR gazed round angered Com-
mittee. AVith slowest enunciation in pro-
foundest chest notes he said, " I will tell with
the hon. Member."
Committee roared with anguished despair;
hut, since procedure in case of frivolous and
vexatious Division seems forgotten by Chair,
no help for it. If there are two Members to
"tell/1 House must be "told." But there
tyranny of two ceases. You may take horse
to water but cannot make mm drink.
Similiarly you may divide House, but cannot
compel Members to vote with you. Thus it
came to pass that after Division CLARK and
WEIR marched up to table with confession
that they had not taken a single man into the
Lobby with them. They had told, but they
had nothing to tell.
"They're worse off by a moiety than the
Squire in the Canterbury Tales," said SARK—
"Him who left half told
The story of Ciimbuscan bold."
"Yes, poor needy Knife-grinders," said the
other SQUIRE; "if they 'd only thought of it
when a^ked by the Clerk, ' How manv ?' they
might have answered, 'Members, Gcd bless
you, we have none to tell.'"
Business done.— Indian Budget through
Committee.
Friday.—Something notable in question
addressed by BRYN HOHERTS to HOME SECRE-
TARY. Wants to know "whether he is aware
that the Mr. WILLIAMS, the recently appointed
assistant inspector, who is said to have worked
at an open quarry, never worked at the rock
up slabs cast aside by the regular quarrymen,
and split them into slates; and that, ever
since, he has been engaged as a pupil teacher
and a schoolmaster.
Shall put notice on paper to ask BKIN
ROBERTS whether the sequence therein set
forth is usual in AVales, and whether picking
up slabs and splitting them into slates is the
customary pathway to pupil teachership.
Long night in Committee of Supply; fair
g-ogress in spite of WELR and CLARK. TIM
EALY sprang ambush on House of Lords:
moved to stop supplies for meeting their house-
hold expenses. Nearly carried proposal, too.
Vote sanctioned by majority of nine, and these
drawn from Opposition.
Business done.— Supply.
A HAWARDEN PASTORAL;
Or, The Grand Old Georgic.
[" The whole care of poultry, the production of
ogga, oare of bees, and the manufacture of butter
—of itself a most important branch of commerce —
are really included within the purposes of thin
little institution."—Mr. Gladstone on "Small
Culture," at the Hatranleii Agricultural and
Horticultural Fete, August 14,1891.]

G. O. Mvlibccus sings:—
WHAT am I piping about to-day?
Suiter, and egqs, and the care of bees!
What shall I praise in my pastoral way''
Sutter, and eggs, and the care of bees .'
Here I am, smiling, afar from strife,
(Indifferent substitute, true, for my wife !)
Discussing, as though they 'd absorbed my life:
Sutter, and eggs, and the care of bees!
A Georgic, my lads, is my task this time.
Sutler, and eggs, and the care of bees .'
HORACE I 've Englished in so-so rhyme,
Sutter, and eggs, and the care of bees!
To-day I am in a Virgilian vein,
My pastoral ardour I cannot restrain;
Ana so I will sing, like some Mantuon swain,
Sutter, and eggs, and the care of bees!
Home Rule? Dear me, no! Not at all in the
mood!
Suiter, and eggs, and the care of bees!
(Though Irish butter, you know, is good.)
Butter, and egys, and the care of bees!
I hear they 're yet wrangling down West-
minster way;
The " Busy B's" there are still having their
say. [lay.
Now the care of those B's—but that is not my
Suiter, and eggs, and the care of beet!
"The frugal bee," (as the Mantuan sings),
Suiter, and eggs, and the care of bees.'
Is valued for honey, and not for stings,
Sutler, and eggs, and the care of beet!
Poor HARCOUHT'S hive has a good many
drones, [that groans?
And more sting than honey. Eh! Who's
Well, well, let me sing, in mellifluous tones,
The ladies have taken to speeches of late,
Sutter, and eggs, and the care of bees!
Serious matter, dear friends,—for the State!
Butter, and eggs, and the care of beet!
On Female Suffrage I hardly dote,
But ladies may speak, while they have not
the vote.—
Beg pardon! That's hardly the pastoral
note!
Sutter, and eggs, and the care of bees '.
Not only to flowers we look, but fruits;
Sutler, and eggs, and the care of bees!
Nay, not to them only, but also to roots.
Sutter, and eggs, und the care of bees!
The root of the matter, in Irish affairs,
Of course is Home Rule—but there, nobody
cares
For such subjects here! Let's sing poultry,
and pears,
Butter, and eggs, and the care of bees .'
This " little culture " 's the theme I'd touch,
Sutter, and eggs, and the care of bees!
(Tories pooh-pooh it !—they 've none too
much!)
Butter, and eggs, and the care of bees!
But "mickles" soon merge into "muckles"
you know.
And from "little cultures" big aggregates
grow,
Jmt as small majorities—Woa, there, woa!—
Butter, and eggs, and the care of bees .'
Hawarden's example will do much good,—
Sutler, and eggs, and the care of bees '.
Nay, friends, I am not in a militant mood,—
Butter, and eggs, and the care of bees!
S > I don't mean mine, but your own example.
The powers of the soil are abundant and
ample;
3'ou'll teach men to furnish—and up to
sample—
Butter, and eggs, and the care of bees!
I'm a little bit tired—in a physical sense—
Butter, and eggs, and the care of bees .'
But my pleasure in pastoral things is immense,
Sutter, and eggs, and the care of bees!
My Georgic to-day I must cut short, I fear,
But—if you desire—and we're all of us here,
I may give you a much longer Eclogue—next
year!
Butter, and eggs, and the care of bees .'
RHYME TO ROSEBERY.
(On his Be rival of the Ministerial jyhitebait
Dinner at the "Shin," Greenwich, Wed-
nesday, August 15, 1894.)
GOOD, PBIMHOSE! If not a fanatical "Saint,"
At least you're a genial " Sinner."
At the thought ef a Race—and a Win—you
won't faint,
Nor squirm at a loss—with a Dinner!
Pluck, patience, and cheer make good States-
manlike form.
We trust that yon reli-hed the trip, Sir!
If not—yet—"the Pilot who weatherid the
Storm,"
You're the Skipper who stuck by the
"Ship," Sir!

WITH rest-thirst and holiday-yearning to

I strive, but in August begin to despair.
I pity poor EVE with the thirst at her thrapple,

My lures are " a brace" and a " pair."

"CONTRIBUTIONS THANKFULLY RECEIVED."

MR TO SEND TOU A BOUQUET? AND IS THEKE ANYTHING ELSE YOU

AND"—{hesitating, then after some consideration)—"I 'M SURE MAMMA
WOULD LIKE THE ICES AND SPONGE CAKES I"
THE TALE OF TWO TELEGRAMS.
ANOTHER DOLLY DIALOGUE.
(By St. Anthony Hope Carter.)
THE redeeming feature of the morning batch of letters was a short
note from Lady MICKLBHAM. Her ladyship (and ARCHIE) had come
back to town, and the note was to say that 1 might call, in fact that
I teas to call, that afternoon. It so happened that I had two engage-
ments, which seemed to make that impossible, but I spent a shilling
in telegrams, and at 4.30 (the hour DOLLY had named) was duly
ringing at the Miekleham town mansion.
"I 'm delighted you were able to come," was DOLLY'S greeting.
"I wasn't able," I said; "but I 've no doubt that what I said in
the two telegrams which brought me here will be put down to your
account."
"No one expects truth in a telegram. The Post-Office people
themselves wouldn't like it."
DOLLY was certainly looking at her very best. Her dimples
(everybody has heard of DOLLY'S Dimples—or is it DOLLY DIMPLE;
but after all it doesn't matter) were as delightful as ever. I was
just hesitating as to my next move in the Dialogue, which I badly
wanted, for I had promised my editor one by ihe middle of next
week. The choice lay between the dimples and a remark lhat life
was, after all, only one prolonged telegram. Just at that moment I
noticed for the first time that we were not alone.
Now that was distinctly exasperating, and an unwarrantable
breach of an implied contract.
"Two's company," I said, in a tone of voice that was meant to
indicate something of what I felt.
"So's three," said DOLLY, laughing, " if the third doesn't count."
"Quod tst demonstrandum."
"Well, it's like this. I observed that you've already published

twenty or so ' Dolly Dialogues.'" (The dimples at this period were
absolutely bewitching, but I controlled myself.) "So it occurred to
me that it was my turn to earn an honest penny. Allow me to
introduce you. Mr! BROWN, Mr. CARTER—Mr. CARTER, Mr. BROWN."
I murmured that any friend of Lady MICKLEHAM'S was a friend
of mine, whereat Mr. BBOWN smiled affably and handed me his card,
from which I gathered that he was a shorthand
writer at some address in Chancery Lane. Then
I understood it all. I had exploited DOLLY.
DOLLY was now engaged in the process of ex-
ploiting me.
"I hope," I observed rather icily, "that you
will choose a respectable paper."
"You don't mean that."
"Perhaps not. But if we are to have a
Dialogue, perhaps we might begin. I have an
engagement at six."
"Telegraph, and put the contents down to
mv account.
I noticed now that DOLLY had a pile of pa-
pers on her table, and that she was playing
with a blue pencil.
"Yes, Lady MICKLEHAM," I said, in the
provisional way in which judges indicate to
counsel that they are ready to proceed.
"Well, I've been reading some of the Press Notices of the Dia-
logues, Mr. CARTER."
I trembled. I remembered some of the things that had been said
about DOLLY and myself, which hardly lent themselves, it appeared
to me, to this third party procedure.
"I thought," pursued DOLLY, "we might spend the time in dis-
cussing the critics."
"I shall be delighted, if in doing that we shall dismiss the
reporter."
Have you seen this? It's from a Scotch paper—Scottish? you
suggest—well, Scottish. 'The sketches are both lively and elegant,
and their lightness is just what people want in the warm weather.'"
"It's a satisfaction to think that even our little breezes are a
source of cool comfort to our fellow-creatures."
"Here 's another criticism. 'It's a book which tempts the
reader '"
"It must have been something you said."
"' • a book which tempts tne reader to peruse from end to
end when once he picks it up.'"
"' Read at a Sitting: A Study in Colour.'"
"Please, Mr. Buowx, don't take that down."
"Thank you, Lady MICKLEHAM," said I. "Litera ecripla manel."
"You are not the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. G'A&TEK, and
you must break yourself of the habit."
"The next cutting?"
"The next says, 'For Mr. CARTER, the hero or reporter '"
"It's a calumny. I don't know a single shorthand symbol."
"Let me go on. 'Reporter of these polite conversations, we
confess we have no particular liking.""
"If you assure me YOU did not write this yourself, Lady MJCKLE-
HAM, I care not who did."
"That, Mr. BROWN," said DOLLY, in a most becoming frown,
"must OH no account go down."
"When vou have finished intimidating the Press, perhaps you
will finish the extract."
"' His cynicism,' " she read, " ' is too strained to commend him to
ordinary mortals '"
"No one would ever accuse you of being in that category."
"' but his wit is undeniable, and his impudence delicious.'
Well, Mr. CARTER?"
"I should like the extract concluded." I knew the next sentence
commenced—" As for DOLLY, Lady MICXLEHAU, she outdoes all the
revolted daughters of feminine fiction."
Then an annoying thing happened. ARCHIE'S voice was heard,
saying, "DOLLY, haven't you finished that Dialogue yet:' We
ought to dress for dinner. It '11 take us an hour to drive there."
So it had been all arranged, and ARCHIE knew for what I had been
summoned.
Yet there are compensations. DOLLY sent the Dialogue to the only
paper which I happen to edit. I regretfully declined it. But. the
fact that she sent it may possibly explain why I have found it so
easy to give this account of what happened on that afternoon when
I sent the two telegrams.

LYRE AND LANCET.
(A Story in Scenes.)
PART IX.—THE MAUVAIS QUART D'HEURE.
SCENE XVI.—The Chinese Drawing Room at Wyvern.
TIME—7.50. Lady CULVERIN t« alone, glancing over a written list.
Lady C'antire (entering). Down already, ALBINIA? I thought if I
made Haste I should get a quiet chat with you before anybody else
came in. What is that paper? Oh, the list of couples for RUPERT.
May I see? (As Lady CULVERIN surrenders it.) My dear, you're
not going to inflict that mincing little PILUNER boy on poor MAISIE!
That really tcon't do. At least let her have somebody she's used to.
Why not Captain THICKNESSE? He's an old friend, and she's not seen
him for months. I must alter that, if you've no objection. (She does.)
And then you 've given my poor Poet
to that SPELWANE girl! Now, why t , i
Lady Culrerin. I thought she
wouldn't mind putting up with him
just for one evening.
Lady Cant. Wouldn't mind.' Put-
ting up with him! And is that how
yon speak of a celebrity when you are
so fortunate as to have one to entertain?
Really, ALBINIA!
Lady Citlv. But, my dear ROHESIA,
you must allow that, whatever his
talents may be, he is not—well, not
quite one of Us. Now, is he?
Lady Cant, (blandly). My deart I
never heard he had any connection
with the manufacture of chemical
manures, in which your worthy Papa
so greatly distinguished himself—if
that is what you mean.
Lady Culc. (with some increase of
colour). That is not what I meant,
ROHESIA—as you know perfectly well.
And I do say that this Mr. SPURRELL'S
manner is most obj ectionable; when he's
not obsequious, he 's horribly familiar!
Lady Cant, (sharply). I have not
observed it. He strikes me as well
enough—for that class of person. And
it is intellect, soul, all that kind of
thing that / value. I look below the
surface, and I find a great deal that is
very original and charming in this
voung man. And surely, my dear, if
I liiul myself able to associate with
him, you need not be so fastidious!
I consider him my protege, and I won't
have him slighted. He is far too good
for VIVIEN SPELWANE!
Lady Culv. (tcith just a suspicion of -.
malice). Perhaps, ROHESIA, yon would
like him to take you in?
Lady Cant. That, of course, is quite
out of the question. I see you have
given me the Bishop—he's a poor, dry
stick of a man—never forgets he was
the Headmaster of Swisham—but he's
always glad to meet me. I freshen
him up so.
Lad;/ Cult: I really don't know whom
I can give Mr. SPURBELL. There 's
RHODA COKATNE, but she's not poe-
tical, and she'll get on much better with ARCHIE BEABPABK. Oh,
I forgot Mrs. BROOKE-CHATTERIS—she's sure to talk, at all events.

Lady Cant, (later—to the Bishop, genially). Ah, my dear
Dr. RODNEY, you and I haven't met since we had our great battle
about—now, was it the necessity of throwing open the Public Schools

intended—or was it the failure of the Church to reach the Working

volume of poetry that everyone is talking about—Andromeda f
The Bithop (conscientiously). I chanced only this morning, by
way of momentary relaxation, to take up a journal containing a
notice of that work, with copious extracts. The impression left on
my mind was—ah—unfavourable; a certain talent, no doubt, some
felicity of expression, but a noticeable lack of the^ah—reticence,

our great Public Schools (I forbear to

can alone impart. I was also pained
to observe a crude discontent with the
existing Social System — a system
which, if not absolutely perfect, cannot
be upset or even modified without the
gravest danger. But I was still more
distressed to note in several passages a
decided taint of the morbid sensuous-
ness which renders so much of our
modern literature sickly and unwhole-

Lady Cant. All prejudice, my dear

As to be of the kind that prove too much.

The present style of dress just makes them so!

IN THREE VOLUMES.
VOLUME I.—Awakening.
AND so the work was done. BELINDA, after a year's hard writing
had completed her self-appointed task. Douglas the Doomed One
had grown by degrees into its present proportions. First the initia
volume was completed; then the second
was finished; and now the third was ^B«a
ready for the printer's hands. But who
should have itP Ah, there was the
rub! BELINDA knew no publishers and
had no influence. How could she get
anyone to take the novel up? And yet,
if she was to believe the Author, there
was plenty of room for untried talent.
According to that interesting periodical
publishers were constantly on the look-
out for undiscovered genius. Why
should she not try the firm of Messrs.
BINDING AND PRINT P She made up her mind. She set her face
hard, and muttered, "Yes, they«Aa«do it! Douglas the Doomed
One shall appear with the assistance of Messrs. BINDING AND
PRINT!" And when BELINDA made up her inind to do anything,
not wild omnibus-horses would turn her from her purpose.
VOLUME II.— Wide Awake.
Messrs. BINDING AND PRINT had received their visitor with
courtesy. They did not require to read Douglas the Doomed One.
They had discovered that it was sufficiently long to make the regula-
tion three volumes. That was all that was necessary. They would
accept it. They would be happy to publish it.
"And about terms ?" murmured BELINDA.
"Half profits," returned Mr. BINDING, with animation.
"When we have paid for the outlay we shall divide the residue,"
cried Mr. PRINT.
"And do you think I shall soon get a cheque?" asked the
anxious authoress.
"Well, that is a question not easy to answer. You see, we
usually spend any money we make in advertising. It does the work
good in the long run, although at first it rather checks the profits."
BELINDA was satisfied, and took her departure.
"We must advertise Douglas the Doomed One in the Skate-
maker's Quarterly Magazine, said Mr. BINDEB.
"And in the Crossing Sweeper's Annual," replied Mr. PRINT.
Then the two partners smiled at one another knowingly. They
laughed as they remembered that of both the periodicals they had
mentioned they were the proprietors.
VOLUME III.—Fast Asleep.
_ The poor patient at Slocum-on-Slush moaned. He had been prac-
tically awake for a mouth, and nothing could send him to sleep.
The Doctor held his wrist, and as he felt the rapid beats of his pulse
became graver and graver.
And you have no friends, no relatives?"
No. My only visitor was the man who brought that box of
woks from a metropolitan library."
"A box of books!" exclaimed the the Doctor. "There may yet be
ime to save his life!"
The man of science rose abruptly, and approaching the casket con-
fining the current literature of the day, roughly forced it open. He
lurriedly inspected its contents. He turned over the volumes im-
>:itinitly until he reached a set.
"The very thing!" he murmured. "If I can but get him to read
his he will be saved." Then turning to his patient he continued,
'You should peruse this novel. It is one that I recommend in cases
,uoh as yours."
"I am afraid I am past reading," returned the invalid. "How-
iver, I will do my best."
An hour later the Doctor (who had had to make some calls) re-
;urned and found that his patient was sleeping peacefully. The first
volume of Douglas the Doomed One had the desired result.
"Excellent, excellent," murmured the medico. "It had the same
ffect upon another of my patients. The crisis is over! He will now
ecover like the other. Insomnia has been conquered for the second
ime by Douglas the Doomed One, and who now shall say that the
href-volume novel of the amateur is not a means of spreading
ivilisation? It must be a mine of wealth to somebody."
And Messrs. BINDING AND PRINT, had they heard the Doctor's re-
mark, would have agreed with him!
All the Difference.
"TOE SPEAKER then called Mr. LITTLE to order."
Quite right in our wise and most vigilant warder.
He calls us to order! Oh that, without fuss,
Prinotown, Devon.—No. 67.
The SPEAKEB could only call Order to us!

IN THREE VOLUMES.
VOLUME I.—Awakening.
AND so the work was done. BELINDA, after a year's hard writing
had completed her self-appointed task. Douglas the Doomed Ont
had grown by degrees into its present proportions. First the initia
volume was completed; then the second .,,
was finished; and now the third was
readv for the printer's hands. But who
should have it? Ah, there was the
rub! BELINDA knew no publishers and
had no influence. How could she get
anyone to take the novel up? And yet,
if she was to believe the Author, there
was plenty of room for untried talent.
According to that interesting periodical
publishers were constantly on the look-
out for undiscovered genius. Why
should she not try the firm of Messrs.
BINDING AND PBINT? She made up her mind. She set her face
hard, and muttered, "Yes, they shall Ao it! Douglas the Doomed
One shall appear with the assistance of Messrs. BINDING AND
PRINT!" And when BELINDA made up her mind to do anything,
not wild omnibus-horses would turn her from her purpose.
VOLUME II.— Wide Awake.
Messrs. BINDING AND PRINT had received their visitor with
courtesy. They did not require to read Douglas the Doomed One.
They had discovered that it was sufficiently long to make the regula-
tion three volumes. That was all that was necessary. They would
accept it. They would be happy to publish it.
'' And about terms ?" murmured BELINDA.
'Half profits," returned Mr. BINDING, with animation.
'When we have paid for the outlay we shall divide the residue,"
cried Mr. PBIXT.
"And do you think I shall soon get a cheque?" asked the
anxious authoress.
Well, that is a question not easy to answer. Yon see, we
usually spend any money we make in advertising. It does the work
food in the long run, although at first it rather checks the profits."
BELINDA was satisfied, and took her departure.
"We must advertise Douglas the Doomed One in the Skate-
maker's Quarterly Magazine," said Mr. BINDER.
"And in the Crossing Sweeper's Annual," replied Mr. PRINT.
Then the two partners smiled at one another knowingly. They
laughed as they remembered that of both the periodicals they had
mentioned they were the proprietors.
VOLUME III.—Fast Asleep.
_ The poor patient at Slocutn-on-Slush moaned. He had been prac-
tically awake for a month, and nothing could send him to sleep.
The Doctor held his wrist, and as he felt the rapid beats of his pulse
became graver and grayer.
And you have no friends, no relatives?"
No. My only visitor was the man who brought that box of
woks from a metropolitan library."
"A box of books!" exclaimed the the Doctor. "There may yet be
time to save his life!"
The man of science rose abruptly, and approaching the casket con-
fining the current literature of the day, roughly forced it open. He
lurriedly inspected its contents. He turned over the volumes im-
patiently until he reached a set.
"The very thing!" he murmured. "If I can but get him to read
.his he will be saved." Then turning to his patient he continued,
''You should peruse this novel. It is one that I recommend in cases
.uch as yours.
"I am afraid I am past reading," returned the invalid. "How-
ever, I will do my best."
An hour later the Doctor (who had had to make some calls) re-
urned and found that his patient was sleeping peacefully. The first
volume of Douglas the Doomed One had the desired result,
"Excellent, excellent," murmured the medico. "It had the same
ffeot upon another of my patients. The crisis is over! He will now
•ecover like the other. Insomnia has been conquered for the second
ime by Douglas the Doomed One, and who now shall say that the
.hree-volume novel of the amateur is not a means of spreading
civilisation? It must be a mine of wealth to somebody."

[•' I desire to submit that this is a very great question, which will have to
be determined, but upon a very different ground from that of the salaries of
the officers of the House of Lords. ... If there is to be a contest between
the House of Lords and the House of Commons, let us take it upon higher
ground than this."—Sir JPilliant Hat-court.]
THERE was a little urchin, and he had an old horse-pistol.
Which he rammed with powder damp and shots of lead, lead,
lead;
And he cried " I know not fear! I '11 go stalking of the deer!"
For this little cove was slightly off his head, head, head.
This ambitious little lad was a Paddy and a Bad,
And himself he rather fancied as a shot, shot, shot;
And he held the rules of sport, and close season, and, in short,
The "regulation rubbish" was all rot, rot, rot.
He held a " bird" a thing to be potted on the wing,
Or perched upon a hedge, or up a tree, tree, tree;
And, says he, "If a foine stag I can add to m> small bag,
A pistol or a Maxim will suit me, me, me!"
And so upon all fours he would crawl about the moors,
To the detriment of elbows, knees, and slack, slack, slack;
And he says, " What use a-talking? If I choose to call this ' stalk-
in?.'
And I bag my game, who's going to hould me back, back, back?"
Sava he, "I scoff at raisons, and Male talk of toimea and saisons;
I 'in game to shoot a fox, or spear a stag, stag, stag;
N« v, I 'd net, or club, a salmon; your old rules of sport are gammon,
For wid me it's just a question of the bag, bag, bag!
"There are omadhauns, I know, who would let a foine buck go
Just bekase 'twas out of toime, or they 'd no gun, gun, gun;
But if oi can hit, and hurt, wid a pistol—or a squirt—
By jabers, it is all the betther fun, fun, fun!"
So he scurryf unged around with his stomach on the ground
(For stalking seems of crawling a mere branch, branch, branch).
And he spied a stag of ten," and he cried, "Hurroo! Now then,
"Fail! I "11 bag that foine Stag Royal, or at any rate oi '11 troy all
The devoices of a sportshman from the Oisle, Oisle, Oisle.

At the risks of rock and heather well may smoile, smoile, smoilc!"
But our sportsman bold, though silly, by a stalwart Highland gillie,
Was right suddenly arrested ere he fired, fired, fired.—
"Hoots! If you'll excuse the hint, that old thing, with kok oi

As a weapon for this sport can't be admired, mired, mired!
"It will not bring down that quarry, ryour horse-pistol! Don't you

This is not the time or place for a-following up this chase;
So just clear out and leave this game to us, us, us!"

SITTING ON OUR SENATE.
SIR,—It struck me that the best and sim-
plest way of finding out what were the inten-
tions of the Government with regard to the
veto of the Peers was to write and ask each
individual Member his opinion on the sub-
ject. Accordingly I have done so, and it
seems to me that there is a vast amount of
significance in the nature of the replies I have
rec*ived, to anyone capable of reading
between the lines; or, as most of the com-
munications only extended to a single line,
let us say to anyone capable of reading
beyond the full-stop. Lord ROSEIIERY'S
Secretary, for example, writes that "the
Piime Minister is at present out of town "—
at present, you see, but obviously on the
point of coming back, in order to grapple
with my letter and the question generally.
Sir WILLIAM HARCOURT, his Secretary,
writes, "is at Wiesbaden, but upon bis
return your communication will no doubt
receive his attention"—receire hit attention,
an ominous phrase for the Peers, who seem
hardly to realise that between them and
ruin there is only the distance from
Wiesbaden to Downing Street. Then Mr.
MORLEY "sees no reason to alter his published
opinion on the subject"—alter, how readily,
by the prefixing of a single letter, that word
becomes halter! I was unable to effect per-
sonal service of my letter on the ATTORNEY-
GENEHAL, possibly because 1 called at his
chambers during the Long Vacation; but the
fact that a card thould have been attached to
his door bearing the words " Back at 2 P.M."
surely indicates that Sir JOHN RIGHT will
lack up his leaders in any approaching attack
on the fortress of feudalism! Then surely
the circumstance that the other Ministers to
whom my letters were addressed hare not as
yet sent any ansirer shows how seriously they
regard the situation, and how disinclined they
are to commit themselves to a too hasty reply!
In fact, the outlook for the House of Lords,
judging from these Ministerial communica-
tions, is decidedly gloomy, and I am inclined
lo think that an Autumn Session devoted to
abolishing it is a most probable eventuality.
Yours, FUSSY-CUSS EXSPLCTANS.
SIB,—The real way of dealing with the
Lords is as follows. The next time that
they want to meet, cut off their gas and
water! Tell the butcher and baker nut to
call at the House for orders, and dismiss the
charwomen who dust their bloated benches.
If this doesn't bring them to reason, nothing
last, "it would be too great a sacrifice."

SITTING ON OUR SENATE.
SIR,—It struck me that the best and sim-
plest way of finding out what were the inten-
tions of the Government with regard to the
veto of the Peers was to write and ask each
individual Member his opinion on the sub-
ject. Accordingly I have done so, and it
seems to me that there is a vast amount of
significance in the nature of the replies I have
received, to anyone capable of reading
between the lines; or, as most of the com-
munications only extended to a single line,
let us say to anyone capable of reading
beyond the full-stop. Lord ROSEBERY'S
Secretary, for example, writes that "the
Prime Minister is at present out of town "—
at present, you see, but obviously on the
point of coming back, in order to grapple
with my letter and the question generally.
Sir WILLIAM HARCOUKT, his Secretary,
writes, "is at Wiesbaden, but upon his
return vour communication will no doubt
receive his attention"—receire his nUention,
an ominous phrase for the Peers, who seem
hardly to realise that between them and
niin there is only the distance from
Wiesbaden to Downing Street. Then Mr.
MORLEY "sees no reason to alter his published
opinion on the subject"—alter, how readily,
by the prefixing of a single letter, that word
becomes halter! I was unable to effect per-
sonal service of my letter on the ATTORNEY-
GENEHAL, possibly because I called at his
chambers during the Long Vacation; but the
fact that a card thould have been attached to
his door bearing the words " Back at 2 P.M."
surely indicates that Sir JOHN RIOBY will
back up his leaders in any approaching attack
on the fortress of feudalism! Then surely
the circumstance that the other Ministers to
whom my letters were addressed have not as
yet sent any ansirer shows how seriously they
regard the situation, and how disinclined they
are to commit themselves to a too hasty reply!
In fact, the outlook for the House of Lords,
judging from these Ministerial communica-
tions, is decidedly gloomy, and I am inclined
to think that an Autumn Session devoted to
abolishing it is a most probable eventuality.
Yours, FcssY-ccss ExsncTANS.
SIB,—The real way of dealing with the
Lords is as follows. The next time that
they want to meet, cut off their gas and
water! Tell the butther and baker not to
call at the House for orders, and dismiss the
charwomen who dust their bloated benches.
If this doesn't bring them to reason, nothing
last, "it would be too great a sacrifice."

of very many days of patient and careful

watchful House, and interested country, how a party should be led.
Had an innings on Saturday, when, in favourite character of
Dompter of British and other Lions, he worried Under Secretaries
for foreign Affairs and the Colonies. Didn't get much out of them.
In fact what happened seems to confirm quaint theory SAHK
advances.
Says he believes those two astute young men, EDWARD GRET and
SYDNEY BU.XTON, "control" the Sheffield Knight. They are active
and ambitious. Still only juniors. Moreover, things are managed
so well both at Foreign Office and Colonial Office that they have no
jpportunity of distinguishing themselves. The regular representa-
Wednesday.—The SQUIRE OF MALWOOD at last got off for his well-
earned holiday. Carries with him consciousness of having done
supremely well amid difficulties of peculiar complication. As^ JOSEPH
in flush of unexpected and still unexplained frankness testified, the
Session will in its accomplished work beat the record of any in
modern times. The San BE been admirably backed by a rare team
of colleagues; but in House of Commons everything depends on the
Leader. Had the Session been a failure, mxm his head would have
fallen obloquy. As it has been a success, his be the praise.
"Well, good bye," said JOHN MOHLEY, tears standing in his
tender eyes as he wrung the hand of the almost Lost Leader. "But
vou know it's not all over yet. There's the Appropriation Bill.
What shall we do if WEIK oomes up on Second Reading?"
"Oh, dam WEIR," said the SQUIRE.
JOHN MORLBY inexpressibly shocked. For a moment thought a
usually equable temper had been ruffled by the almost continuous
work of twenty months, culminating in an all-night sitting. On
.ff „ reflection he saw that the SQUIRE was merely adapting an engineer-

on ooth sides of House, knock
over the intruder. Sort of game

for young Parliamentary Hands.

his step towards House of Com-
mons, seems to leave all his
shrewdness and knowledge of
the world in his chambers, rose
to the fly; played BASHMEAD-
ARTLETT'S obvious game by

Meanwhile one of the candi-

verse. "NEWNES," he exclaims^
"NEWNES, noble hearted, shine,

make some men vain. There

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
i

IS THE BAR A PROFITABLE PROFESSION?
(A Query to be answered during the Long Vacation.)
I AM always reluctant to obtrude my personality upon the British
Public. All the world know my address in the Temple, and so long
as my learned friends who act as intermediaries between myself and
the litigation-loving public bear me in mind, I require no further
advertisement. However, I cannot
close my eyes to Duty, and Duty points
to the pages of a paper that may be
aptly called the organ of the Bench,
the Jury, and the Bar. 1 feel compelled
to publish the following short story in
the columns of that organ as a proof of
the degeneracy of the profession to
which I have the honour to belong. I
(•hall be only too pleased if my Spartan-
like conduct proves of benefit to my
fellow-counsel. I write in their service,
and without an eye—yes, I venture to
say half an eye—to the main chance.
My narrative will prove that ignorance,
and, if I may be permitted to say so,
unpardonable ignorance exists at the
Law C mrts. I have kept silent until the Long Vacation has com-
menced. My reason for this reticence is not difficult to discover.
Had I taken the public into my confidence at an earlier date, it would
be obvious lhat I might have suffered in professional status. Now
that the Long Vacation has been reached, there is ample time for the
process known as " living it down." But I will not anticipate.
I must confess that I was not a little pleased the other day to learn
from my excellent clerk, PORTINGTON, that a representative of the
firm of CLOGS, JUDAS, AND FRIARS, were anxious to see me on a
matter of business.
"Have I had them as clients before?" I asked my worthy
assistant.
"Oh, no, Sir," returned PoRTDfoioy. "You see, for the last
five years you have only had"
"Yes, yes," I interrupted, for my excellent clerk is sometimes
inclined to become a trifle prosy. "I will see him at once. Is he in
my room'("
"Well, no, Sir; as you said that Mr. INKKRTON might use it for
the soda-water cases, I thought it would be better to show him into
Mr. BLOCK'S room. You see, Sir, it is tidier than your room; for
since we have had the lawn-tennis nets"
But here I again interrupted my worthy assistant, who, I am
forced to admit, h sometimes a trifle discursive. I interrupted him,
and, entering BLOCK'S room, made the acquaintance of my new
client.
"I think, Sir," said my visitor. "that you are of opinion that
there is no custom concerning the dismissal of office messengers f"
I never like to commit myself without referring to my books, so I
was silent for a moment.
"At least," continued my client, "you have not heard of any?"
"Well, no," I returned; "so far as my experience goes, I have
not come across the custom."
"That's quite enough for us, Sir. If you will swear that, we
shall want nothing further."
Rather to ray disgust my visitor suddenly placed a subpana in my
hand, and told me that the case would most likely be in the list on
the following day. Annoyed at his brusqueness I told him I had been
ready to accept him gratuitously as a client. I added that as I now
found I was only in request as a witness I should require a guinea.
"Oh, of course," said my visitor, producing the cash. "Welooked
you out, and your name is in the Luw List; and I see, too, you
have painted it on the door of Mr. BLOCK'S chambers."
Disdaining to smile at what I considered to be rather a clumsy
attempt at plaisantet ie, I bowed, and rang the bell.
"Perhaps we had better have your private address, Sir," continued
my visitor. "It would be safer, for then we could wire to you when
it came on, and you would be sure to get our telegram."
"I am always here while the Courts are sitting," I returned, in a
tone of hauteur; "so you must please wire to me here."
"Just as you like, Sir."
And a few minutes later my clerk saw my visitor safely oft the
premises. I admit that I was slightly annoyed at the term " wire."
It is 1 mi' that his firm's name had not appeared—at any rate,
recently—in my fee-book, but that was no reason why he should
suggest that I was constantly absent from my chambers. I really
pitied Messrs. CLOGS, JUDAS AND FRIARS for having a clerk with so
little tact, and such a small stock of experience.
On the following morning, when I was standing at the door of the
Corey Street Robing Room, considering whether 1 should assume my
forensic costume, or enter the Court as a layman, I was accosted by
the same individual, who told me " that we were third on the list."
"So you will be wanted almost at once, Sir," said he.
How long
"Well, I shall be able to come," I replied, "as, strange to say,
I have no business before their Lordships to-day."
"Chiefly chamber practice. I suppose, Sir?"
"Quite so," I returned, looking him steadily in the face. "I
mean to-day."
I •will not tell a wearisome story of how I had to hang about the
Court until the interval for luncheon, and longer. I will hurry to
the point when I entered the witness-box. To my surprise and secret
satisfaction there was quite a stir when my name was called out.
The Silks in the front row smiled, and my colleagues the juniors
tittered. Even his Lordship looked up with an expression of pleasant
anticipation. I was duly sworn, and gave my name.
"Now, Sir," said the Counsel for our side, "tt-11 me.
have you known anything about office messengers?"
I considered for a moment. As a Member of the Bar (although
I had not been asked for my profession—no doubt that was suffi-
ciently well known) I desired to set an example. I wished to show
what a witness should be. I desired to appear as a model worthy of
close and universal imitation.
"I have seen office messengers in offices for many years—as long
as I can remember."
I spoke with absolute gravity. To my astonishment there was a
titter which grew into a roar of laughter; even his Lordship found
it difficult to control his cachinnation.
"Yes," said the counsel, when he had partially recovered his
gravity. "But, tell me, do you know any custom in connection
with their dismissal?"
Again I considered the matter for a few seconds, and made a second
reply.
"No; I am unaware of any special custom in connection with their
dismissal."
This time there was no titter. My answer was received at once
with the wildest merriment. The Judge laughed as much as anyone,
and the Usher had to wipe his head with his handkerchief, so
greatly moved was he by his sense of the ridiculous.
My Counsel sat down convulsed, and had to conceal his face behind
his brief.
"I really don't think," gasped out the judge, "that this witness
need be cross-examined."
And I was not. As I returned to my seat amidst the smiles of
everyone in Court, a reporter asked me for my Christian name.
Before I could reply, one of my colleagues in wig and gown gave him
what he supposed was the necessary information.
"But you arc wrong," I whispered, and (with a view of crushing
him) handed him my card.
"You don't say so," returned my learned friend; "why, we
thought yon were PANTO,—the chap you know, who writes as
'YORICK ' for the Serio-Comic Jester.
And it had come to this! I had been taken, or rather mistaken,
for a humorous contributor! And this after about a quarter of a
century's service at the Bar! And yet there are those who say that
the profession is not going to the dogs!
However, I must express my surprise at the conduct of the judtfe.
It is not ten years since that I had the pleasure of holding a consent
brief before him. And yet he had forgotten me! When the Bench
is so forgetful, how can Silk and Stuff he expected to have better
memories!

questions, and make insinuations derogatory to the character of
British statesmen at home and
British officials abroad? Then
they step in, and, amid applause
on both sides of House, Knock
over the intruder. Sort of game
of House of Commons nine-pins.
Nine-pin doesn't care so that

for young Parliamentary Hands.

shrewdness and knowledge of
the world in his chambers, rose

ARTLETT'S obvious game by

Business done.—Supply voted with both hands.
Wednesday.—The SQUIRE OF MAJLWOOD at last got off for his well-
earned holiday. Carries with him consciousness of having done
supremely well amid difficulties of peculiar complication. As JOSEPH
in flush of unexpected and still unexplained frankness testified, the
Session will in its accomplished work beat the record of any in
modern times. The SQUIRE been admirably backed by a rare team
of colleagues: but in House of Commons everything depends on the
Leader. Had the Session been a failure, upon his head would have
fallen obloquy. As it has been a success, his be the praise.
"Well, good bye," said JOHN MORLEY, tears standing in his
tender eyes as he wrung the hand of the almost Lost Leader. "But
vou know it's not all over yet. There's the Appropriation Bill.
What shall we do if WKIU comes up on Second Reading?"
"Oh, dam WEIR," said the SQUIRE.
JOHN MORLBY inexpressibly shocked. For a moment thought a
usually equable temper had been ruffled by the almost continuous
work of twenty months, culminating in an all-night sitting. On
reflection he saw that the SQUIRE was merely adapting an engineer-
ing phrase, describing a proceeding common enough on river courses.
The only point on which remark open to criticism is that it is
tautological.
Easiness done.—Appropriation Bill brought in.
Thursday.—GEORGE NEW.VES looked in just now; much the same
as ever; the same preoccupied, almost pensive look; a mind weighed
down by ever-multiplying circulation. Troubled with consideration
of proposal made to him to pub-
lish special edition of Slrand

"NEWNES, noble hearted, shine,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
t

IS THE BAR A PROFITABLE PROFESSION?
(A Query to be answered during the Long Pacalion.)
I AM always reluctant to obtrude my personality upon the British
Puhlio. All the world know my address in the Temple, and so long
as my jearned friends who act as intermediaries between myself and
the litigation-loving public bear me in mind, I require no further
advertisement. However, I cannot
close my eyes to Duty, and Duty points
to the pages of a paper that may be
aptly called the organ of the Bench,
the Jury, and the Bar. 1 feel compelled
to publish the following short story in
the columns of that organ as a proof of
the degeneracy of the profession to
which I have the honour to belong. I
shall be only too pleased if my Spartan-
like conduct proves of benefit to my
fellow-counsel. I write in their service,
and without an eye—yes, I venture to
say half an eye—to the main chance.
My narrative will prove that ignorance,
and, if I may be permitted to tay so,
unpardonable ignorance exists at the
Law C lurts. I have kept silent until the Long Vacation has com-
menced. My reason for this reticence is not difficult to discover.
Had 11 aken the public into my confidence at an earlier date, it would
be obvious that I might have suffered in professional status. Kow
that the Long Vacation has been reached, tnere is ample time for the
process known as " living it down." But I will not anticipate.
I must confess that I was not a little pleased the other day to learn
from my excellent clerk, PORTINGTON, that a representative of the
firm of CLOGS, JUDAS, AND FRIARS, were anxious to see me on a
matter of business.
"Have I had them as clients before?" I asked my worthy
assistant.
"Oh, no, Sir," returned PoRTijforoy. "You see, for the last
five years you have only had"
"Yes, yes," I interrupted, for my excellent clerk is sometimes
inclined to become a trifle prosy. "I will see him at once. Is he in
my room?"
"Well, no, Sir; as you said that Mr. INKERTOW might use it for
the soda-water cases, I thought it would be better to show him into
Mr. BLOCK'S room. You see, Sir, it is tidier than your room; for
since we have had the_ lawn-tennis nets"
But here I again interrupted my worthy assistant, who, I am
forced to admit, is sometimes a trifle discursive. I interrupted him,
and, entering BLOCK'S room, made the acquaintance of my new
client.
"I think, Sir," said my visitor, "that you are of opinion that
there is no custom concerning the dismissal of office messengers f"
1 never like to commit myself without referring to my books, so I
was silent for a moment.
"At least," continued my client, " you have not heard of any?"
"Well, no," I returned; "so far as my experience goes, I have
not come across the custom."
"That's quite enough for us, Sir. If you will swear that, we
shall want nothing further."
Rather to my disgust my visitor suddenly placed a subpccna in my
hand, and told me that the case would most likely be in the list on
the following day. Annoyed at his brusqueness 1 told him I had been
ready to accept him gratuitously as a client. I added that as I now
found 1 was only in request as a witness I should require a (niinea.
"Oh, of course," said my visitor, producing the cash. "We looked
you out, and your name is in the Law List; and I see, too, you
nave painted it on the door of Mr. BLOCK'S chambers."
Disdaining to smile at what I considered to be rather a clumsy
attempt at plaisuntet ie, I bowed, and rang the bell.
"Perhaps we had better have your private address, Sir," continued
my visitor. "It would be safer, for then we could wire to you when
it came on, and you would be sure to get our telegram."
"I am always here while the Courts are sitting," I returned, in a
tone of hauteur; "so you must please wire to me here."
"Just as you like, Sir."
And a few minutes later my clerk saw my visitor safely off the
?remises. I admit that I was slightly annoyed at the term wire."
t is true that his firm's name had not appeared—at any rate.
recently—in my fee-book, but that was no reason why he should
buffgest that I was constantly absent from my chambers. I really
pitied Messrs. CLOGS, .11 MAS AND FRIABS for having a clerk with so
little tact, and such a small stock of experience.
On the following morning, when I was standing at the door of the
Carey Street Robing Room, considering whether 1 should assume my
forensic costume, or enter the Court as a layman, I was accosted by
the same individual, who told me " that we were third on the list."
"So you will be wanted almost at once, Sir," said he.
"Well, I shall be able to come," I replied, "as, strange to say,
I have no business before their Lordships to-day."
"Chiefly chamber practice, I suppose, Sir?"
"Quite so," I returned, looking him steadily in the face. "I
mean to-day."
I will not tell a wearisome story of how I had to hang about the
Court until the interval for luncheon, and longer. I will hurry to
the point when I entered the witness-box. To my surprise and secret
satisfaction there was quite a stir when my name was called out.
The Silks in the front row smiled, and my colleagues the juniors
tittered. Even his Lordship looked up with an expression of pleasant
anticipation. I was duly sworn, and gave my name.
"Now, Sir," said the Counsel for our side, "tell me. How long
have you known anything about office messengers?"
I considered for a moment. As a Member of the Bar (although
I had not been asked for my profession—no doubt that was suffi-
ciently well known) I desired to set an example. I wished to show
what a witness should be. I desired to appear as a model worthy of
close and universal imitation.
"I have seen office messengers in offices for many years—as long
as I can remember."
I spoke with absolute gravity. To my astonishment there was a
titter which grew into a roar of laughter; even his Lordship found
it difficult to control his cachinnation.
"Yes," said the counsel, when he had partially recovered his
gravity. "But, tell me, do you know any custom in connection
with their dismissal?"
Again I considered the matter for a few seconds, and made a second
'No; I am unaware of any special custom in connection with their
dismissal."
This time there was no titter. My answer was received at once
with the wildest merriment. The Judge laughed as much as anyone,
and the Usher had to wipe bis head with his handkerchief, so
greatly moved was he by his sense of the ridiculous.
My Counsel sat down convulsed, and had to conceal his face behind
his brief.
"I really don't think," gasped out the judge, "that this witness
need be cross-examined."
And I was not. As I returned to my seat amidst the smiles of
everyone in Court, a reporter asked me for my Christian name.
Before I could reply, one of my colleagues in wig and gown gave him
what he supposed was the necessary information.
"But you are wrong," I whispered, and (with a view of crushing
him) handed him m \ card.
"You don't say so," returned my learned friend; "why, we
thought you were PANTO,—the chap you know, who writes as
'YOKICK ' for the Serio-Cumic Jester.
And it had come to this! I had been taken, or rather mistaken,
for a humorous contributor! And this after about a quarter of a
century's service at the Bar! And yet there are those who say that
the profession is not going to the dogs!
However, I must express my surprise at the conduct of the judge.
It is not ten years since that I had the pleasure of holding a consent
brief before him. And yet he had forgotten me! When the Bench
is so forgetful, how can Silk and Stuff be expected to have better
memories t

THE ETHICS OF THE HONEYMOON.
DEAH SIB,—I desire in your valuable paper
to draw attention to a question which I have
been carefully considering for a great number
of years: Are Honeymoons right? Man and
boy I have been a bachelor these forty years,
and as such have had peculiar and extensive
opportunities for seeing that "most of the
game" which is reserved for outsiders. As
the result of my observation, I confidently
assert that honeymoons are useless, dangerous,
and ought to be abolished. They are useless
in that the only people they profit are the
hotel-keepers. They are dangerous to the
happy pairs, who see enough of one another
and a Hyde Park

THE LAW OF THE (SOCIAL) JUNGLE.
MB. RUDYABD KIPLING has given us in his
own inimitable way a sample of Jungle Law,
which, as he says, is of "immense com-
plexity." Now Society is also a Jungle, the
Human Jungle. In it the Bete-Humaine
congregates, for a variety of purposes. Its
laws also are complex, and wonderfully like
those of the Wolves as Saloo gave them in
sing-song. For example:—
(For " Wolf" read " Worldling,"for "Jungle"
the "Social World.'1)
Xow this is the Law of the Jungle—so ancient
that no one ado " Why?"
And the Wolf that shall keep it may proiper, but
the Wolf that shall break it must fly,
As the cobweb that meshes the comer*, the Law
nets Society's track—
For the strength of the Pack is the Wclf, and the
strength of the Wolf is the Pack.
I.
"Tub" daily from head-crown to toe-tip;
drink freely but seldom too deep;
And remember the night is for laiks, and
forget not the day is for sleep.
ii.
The Jackal may sponge on the Lion; but, Cub,
when thy whiskers are grown,
Remember the Wolf is a hunter—go forth
and track prey of thine own.
ill.
Keep peace with the Lords of the Jungle, the
Hebrew, the Bobby, the Beak;
And fool not with Elephant Law, which is
given to squelching the weak.
IV.
When Pack crosses Pack in the jungle, and
neither will budge from the trail.
Lie down till the Lawyers have spoken, for
tongue against tooth may prevail!
v.
When ye fight with a Wolf of the Pack, do
not fight him alone or afar,
Let others look on at the scrimmage, the Pack
is amused by such war.
VI.
The House of the Wolf is his refuge, and
where he has made him his home,
If he is a Wolf of fair cunning, not e'en
County Councils may come.
VII.
The House of the Wolf is his refuge, but let
him shun odorous drain.
Or the Council will send him a "Notice,"
and he '11 have to " repair" it again.
yin.
If ye hunt after midnight be careful, and
block not the public nighway.
Lest ye draw the police from their gossips,
and have Forty Shillings to pay.
IX.
Ye may kill female souls for your pleasure,
may snare them the best way ye can,
But mind you don't poach on preserves that
belong to a wealthier man!
x.
If ye plunder his Kill from a weaker, don't
put on too much " blooming side."
Some deeds it is lawful to do, which, as being
"bad form," you should hide.
XI.
The " form" of the Pack is the law of the
Pack. It will pardon white lies.
And a wriggle or two, but that Wolf's a gone

Wonderful, is it not, how little the Law of

PART X.-BORROWED PLUMES.
SCENE XVII.—UNDEBSHELL'S Bedroom in the East Wing at Wyvern.
TIME—About 9 P.M.
The Steward's Room Boy (knocking and entering). Brought you
up some 'ot water, Sir, case you 'd like to clean up afore supper.
Undershell. I presume evening dress is not indispensable in the
Housekeeper's Koom; but I can hardly make even the simplest toilet
women have so many really serious matters to attend to—arranging
about dinners, and visits, and trying on frocks, and then rushing
about from party to party. I so seldom get a quiet moment. Ah, I
knew I wanted to ask you something. Did you ever know anyone
called Lady GRISOLINE?
Spurr. Lady—er— GRISOLINE? No; can't say I do. I know Lady

Boy. I never "eard nothink of no porkmanteau, Sir! not.
Und. You will hear a good deal about it, unless it is forthcoming
at once. Just lind out what 's become of it—a new portmanteau, with
a white star painted on it. [The Boy retires, impressed; an interval.
Soy (re-appearing). I managed to get a few words with TIIOMAS,
our second footman, just as he was coming out o' the 'All, and h
sez the only porkmanteau with a white star was took up to the
Verney Chamber, which THOMAS unpacked it hisself.
I'm/. Then tell THOMAS, with my compliments, that he will
trouble himself to
pack it again imme-
diately.
Boy. But THOMAS
has to wait at table,
and besides, he says
as he laid out the
dress things, and the
gen'lman as is in the
Verney Chamber is a
wearin' of 'em now.
Sir.
Und. (indignant}.
But they 're mine.'
Confound his impu-
dence! Here, I '11
write him a line at
once. (He scribbles a
note.) Here, see that
the gentleman of the
Verney Chamber gets
this at once, and bring
me his answer.
Boy. What! me go
into 'the Dinin' 'All,
with all the swells at
table? I dursn't. I
should get the saok
from old TBEDDY.
Und. I don't care
who takes it so long
as it is taken. Tell
THOMAS it's his mis-
take, and he must do
what he can to put it
right. Bay I shall
certainly complain if
I don't get back my
clothes and portmanteau. Get that note delivered, and I '11 give
vou half-a-crown. (To himself, an the Boy departs much against
'his will.) So, not content with denying me a place at her table, this
Lady CULVEBIN allows her minions to clothe a more favoured guest
at my expense! I 'm hanged if I stand it!
SCENE XVIII.—The Dining Hall. The table is oval; SPUBHELL is
placed between Lady Itnov.t COKAYNE and Mrs. BROOKE-CHATTEBIS.
Mrs. C'hatteris (encouragingly, after they lire seated). Now, I shall
expect you to be very brilliant 'and entertaining. 7 '11 do all the lis-
tening for once in a way—though, generally, I can talk about all
manner of silly things with anybody!
Spurrell (extremely ill at ease). Oh—er—I should say you were
equal to that. But 1 really can't think of anything to talk about.
Mrs. Chatt. That's a bad beginning. I always find the menu
cards such a good subject when there's anything at all out of the
common about them. If they 're ornamented, you can talk about
them—though not for very long at a time, don't you think?
Spurr. (miserably). I can't say how long I could go on about
ornamented ones—but these are plain. (To himself.) I can hear this
waistcoat going already; and we 're onlv at the soup!
Mrs. Cnatt. It i« a pity. Never mind; tell me about literary and
artistic people. Do you know I 'm rather glad 1 'm not literary or
artistic myself—it seems to make people so queer-looking, somehow.
Oh, of course I didn't mean you looked queer— but generally, you
know. You've made quite a success with your Andromeda, haven't
Spun: (to himself). I don't understand more than »bnut half
she's saying. (Aloud.) Oh, I don't see anything particularly green
about you.

to be complimentary—no, you needn't explain. Now tell me, is

".It docs seem to me such—well, such footle!"
there any news about the Laureateship? Who's going to get it?
Will it be SWINBUBNE or LEWIS MOBBIS?
Spurr. (to himself). Never heard of the stakes or the horses
either. (Aloud.) Well,
to tell you the truth,
I haven't been follow-
ing their form — too
many of these small
events nowadays.
Mm. Chatt. (to
herself). It's quite
amusing how jealous
these poets are of one
another! (Aloud.) Is
it true they get a butt
of sherry given them
for it?
Spurt: I've heard
of winners getting a
bottle or two of cham-
pagne in a bucket—
not sherry. But a
little stimulant won't
hurt a crack when he
comes in, provided it's
not given him too
soon; wait till he's
got his wind and done
blowing, you know.
Mrs. Chatt. I 'm
taking that in. I
know it's very witty
and satirical, and 'I
daresay I shall un-
derstand it in time.
Spnrr. Oh, it doesn't
matter much if you
don't. (To himself.)
Pleasant kind of wo-
man—but a perfect
fool to talk to!
Mrs. Chatt. (to herself). I 've always heard that clever writers
are rather stupid when you meet them—it's quite true.
Captain Thicknesse (to himself). I should like her to see that I 've
got some imagination in me, though she does think me such an as«.
(Aloud, to Lady MAISIE.) Jolly old hall this is, with the banners, and
the gallery, and that—makes you fancy some of those old mediaeval
Johnnies in armour—knights, you know—comin' clankin' in and
turnin' us all out.
Lady Maisie (to herself). I do trust Mr. SPUBUELL isn't saying
something too dreadful. I 'm sure I heard my name just now.
(Aloud, absently, to Capt. THICKNESSE.) No, did you really f H)w
amusing it must have been!
Capt. Thick, (at/grieved). If you'd done me the honour of payin' any
attention to what I was savin', you 'd have found out it tfO*»'t amusdn'.
Lady M. (starting). Oh, wasn't it? I'm so sorry I missed it.
I—I 'm afraid I was thinking of something else. Do tell me ;i aiu!
('apt. Thick, (still hurt). No, I won't inrtict it on you—not worth
repeatin'. And I should only be takin' off your attention from a
fellow that does know how to talk.
Lady M. (with a guiltiness which she tries to carry off under
dignity). I don't think I understand what you mean.
Capt. Thick. Well, I couldn't help hearm' what you said to your
poet-friend before we went in about having to put up with partners;

frank with an old friend, instead of leavin it to come through some-

astonish him!
Lady Rhoda (to SPURREI.L). I say—I am in a funk. Only just
heard who I 'm next to. I always do feel such a perfect fool when
I 've got to talk to a famous person—and you 're frightfully famous,
aren't you?
Spurr. (modestly). Oh, I don't know—I suppose I am, in a sort of
way, through Andromeda. Seem to think so here, anyhow.
Lady Rh. Well, I 'd better tell you at once, I 'm no good at

THE VOYAGE OF ALFRED.
[Sec Mr. ALFRBU AUSTIN'S article, entitled " That Damnable Country,"
in Blackicood'i Magazine.']
"LAND, land!" cried ALFKED ADSTIN. "By my halidom, I spy

Many weary leagues we've wandered since we left our native
shores,
Seeking still through calm and tempest a remote nnd barren island,
While we smote the sounding furrows of the ocean with our oars.
"Never wind availed.to beat us; by
the waters overweighted,
Or becalmed, with idle canvas hang-
ing loosely from the mast,
Yet we steered her or we rowed her
with our courage unabated,
And, our labours past and over, we
have come to land at last.
"Though the land be bleak and
barren, though barbarians its
dwellers,
Let us add this last achievement to
the record of our deeds;
When the savage tribes come shout-
ing as attackers and resellers,
We can win the men with clothing
and the women-folk with beads.
"There be savages in India as in
Tierra del Fuego;
There be savages in Xululand with shield and assegai;
We have tamed them, whether cannibals or fed on rice and sago—
Shall a Briton ever flinch from such? No, by the Lord, not I'."
On the land he had discovered thus the Poet AUSTIN landed;
MABCO POLO or COLUMBUS might have envied him the scene;
And in prose he has described it, in a language understanded
Of the people, and has printed it in Ulackwoott's Magazine,
The scenery was beautiful, so lovely that it dazed him;
He thought their manners charming, and he rather liked their rain.
He did not find them savages, which seems to have amazed him;
And he tells us all to visit them again and yet again.
We thank you for the hints you give describing what you 've seen
there,
_It really is amazing; but (a whisper in your ear)

Describing how an Irishman can really oe polite:
"Behold," you say, " the Irishman as patronised by AUSTIN;
He is not black, though painted so—in fact he's rather white."
Don't patronise so much, dear A. I do not say you write ill;
But oh that awful title, with its most offensive I)!
Devoutly do I hope, dear A., you'll find a better title,
And write a wiser article when next you cross the sea.

SAPPHICS ON TRAFFIC.
(A Lover of London to a Weary Would-be Wayfarer.)

Wouin-BE wayfarer! little think the proud ones
Who in their coaches roll along the turnpike-
Road, what hard work 'tis trying all day for Firnlico,
Or Piceaoilly.
Tell me, wayfarer, how these Omnibuses,
Growlers, and Hansoms, carts and vansof PICKFORD,
Slithering slowly over the slippery asphalte,
Manage a journey!
Lingering loitering is not Locomotion!
Trickling slow trailing through attenuate tho-
roughfares.
Paroxysms of crawl and block alternate,
Call you these Traffic!
Civic Would-be If'ayfarer.
Traffic? Why bless you! We have none worth calling so;
'Tisn't a thing expected in London City.
This sluggish crawling varied with stoppage is all that
We may attain to.
What with the narrow labyrinths miscalled thoroughfares,
What with the sewers and gas, the water and telegraphs,
Traffic is simply a species of lingering agony,
In the Metropolis!
Something is always " up," Sir, pipe-layers, paviors,
Stirrers of most malodorous witch-broth cauldrons,
Makers of shindy and stench, with poor old Babylon,
Play up old Gooseberry!
Courts and Councils, Committees and Correspondents,
Always reporting, writing, and railing concerning it;
Nothing comes of it all save chaos more complicate,
And higher ratings.
Cheapside, Fleet Street, Strand, all semi-impassable,
Scarcely a " right-away" road in all the Capital;
As for the "affluents" of our so-called arteries,

Now, he was a Conservative (barks), and he
believed in the good roast beef of Old Eng-
land. (Barks and whining.) He regretted,
too that many employers used an inferior
kind of dog biscuit. (Howls.) If there were
one form of food more repulsive than another
itwasthejfncfe sitcle dog biscuit. (Laughter.)
Had it any meat in it at all? (" No.") Was
it composed chiefly of bad animal fat and
bran? (" Yes."} There was yet one more
grievance he had to mention. On washing
days (howls) it was sad to think that their
dignity should be lowered by having to sub-
mit to a coat of lather. In this matter some
otherwise excellent employers teemed afflicted
with rabies. (Barks.) He would leave it to
the consideration of the Congress whether a
universal strike against the grievances he had
enumerated should be organised.
[Loud and general barking.
At the close of the President's address the
Congress adjourned for the day.
Papers have been promised on Cats, and
How to Tackle them," on "The Temptation
presented by Cyclists' Calves," and on
"Hygienic Kennels." A very attractive pro-
gramme of excursions to places of interest in
the vicinity has also been arranged. Members
of the Congress will be enabled to swim ovtr
to the south tide of the Thames, and inspect
the Dogs' Home at Batteraea, if the Manager
will admit them. A happy day amc.n? the
deer in Greenwich Park is contemplated, and
Barking will of course receive a visit. Alto-
gether, if the police do not interfere, a
thoroughly enjoyable outing is anticipated.

THE annual Canine Congress opened yester-
day in the Isle of Dogs. Should the weather
prove favourable it is expected that the re-
union will be most successful. The Presi-
dential Address was delivered by A. NEW-
FOUNDLAND. Esq., winner of the first prize in
a recent Crystal Palace Show.
The President, who was received with
general tail-wagging and yelping, observed
that a statement had recently appeared in the
public Press to the effect that there were two
million dogs in the United Kingdom. (Sen-
tation.) Yes, he was so informed by his
employer's scullery maid, in whom he had
implicit confidence, as she always acted very
liberally towards him in the matter of bones.
(Applause.) What he wanted to know was,
did all these dogs pay their licences, as they
ought to do? (Generalbarking.) All dogs
who did not pay should be " collared "—either
some dissent.) If there were really two
millions of their race, it could hardly be
denied that the United Kingdom deserved the
title of the true " Dogs' Home." (Laughter.)
But they had several crying—he meant howl-
ing—grievances. In the first place there
were too many mongrels about. (6roK>«.)
Yes in their case multiplication was vexa-
tion. (A laugh.) He would put it to the
common sense of the meeting. Obviously
there was only a certain quantity of bones
in the country. Well, the fewer dogs the
more bones would there be for the remainder.
(Barks of assent.) Then, as to the excellent
legal doctrine, the Palladium of their liberties,
that "Every dog may have one bite. He
was sorry to see that some magistrates had
been inclined to throw doubt on the justice of
this maxim, and he hoped the LOED CHAN-
CELLOR would fly at those magistrates-he
meant remove them. (Barks.) Anotherpomt

EGBERT ON AMERRYCANS.
WHAT grand fellers them Amerrycans is!
I have alters admired em since I fust made
aquaintence with the real Gent as I used to
wait upon at the Grand Otel at Cherring
Cross, and he was
a reel Gent if ever
there was one!
Well, I was
atendinguponjest
such another gent
at quite a grand
Party the other
night; and, when
it was all over, the
principle Gennel-
inan came up to
me and interduced
me to him as an
Amerrycan Gent
as wanted to speak
to me, and he then
acshally told me
as how as my little
Book was about
one of the most populerest in all the United
States! And he then arsked me how manv
copies we had sold? And when I thort as I
shoud estonish him by telling him as I be-
leeved as it was sumthing about seventeen
thowsend, he said as how as that was nothink
to what he should have xpected, for a hunderd
thowsend would not have surprised him! for
he had bin told as how as one of their werrv
leadingest men, I rayther think as he said it
was the Pressident, or a great friend of his
whenever he was a good deal bothered about
State matters, allers caHed for a copy of
"Robert," for it was quite sure to put mm
all to rites again, and send him to bed with a
jolly larf!
Well, I thort as this was all pritty well,
but he acshally finished up by arsking me
whether I coudent write another wollum jest
like the other! for he was sure as any of their
grate Publishers coud sell any quantity of
em! speshally if they thort it woud take the
shine out of the Englisher by saying it was
by WASHINGHAM! He then introduced me
to another Amerrycan, and asked him what
he thort of his plan? To which he replied
that he didn't know much about publishing,
but he was quite sure there was nothink in
that or in any other matter in which an^Amer-
rvcan coud not lick all creation! And then
they both went away larflng!
Tho what there was to larf at in such a
werry serious matter as they had bin a tork-
ing about I'm sure I cant make out, the
more so as I ain't heard a single word from
em since, and even thinks it werry possible
as I never shall.
Strange to_ say I had a most wunderful
dream that night! I dremt as I was reelly in
Amerrykey. and haying a long conwersation
with a reel live Publisher all about an Amer-
rycan " Robert"! and jest as we was aranging
all about the price, and the number of
Wolumes, and the way he was to send me
all the money, I suddenly woke, and found
myself a lying by the side of Mrs. ROBERT 1
and about as much estonished as ewer I found
myself in all my long life! ROBERT.

OR, RHYME AND REASON.
(By Baron (Irimbosh.)
SINCE first the Muse to melody gave birth,
And with rhyme's chymings blest a happy

Poetic seekers of a " perfect rhyme"
Have missed the bull's-eye almost every
thyme.
We want a brand-new Versifiers' Guide,
And he who Pegasus would neatly ruide,
Must shun bards' beaten highways, read no

Nor by phonetic laws his stanzas trymn.
The eye's the Muse's judge, and by the eye
Parnassian PJTMANS must the poet treye.
Rhyme to the ear is wrong; at any rate,
Rhyme that greets not the eye cannot be
grate,
And though by long wrong usage sanctified,
It may not pass my new Poetic Gied.
These new Rhyme-Rules let bardlings get by
heart,
For from the New Parnassus must depeart,
From TopLAnr to TENNYSON, all those
Who prove sweet Poesy's false phonetic fose.

False rhymes the most atrocious upon earth,
Which might move MOMUS to derisive

And not, as now, in one loud howl sonorous,

Will to Parnassus lift delighted ise;
And from St. Albans to the Arctic Pole,
The " lyric cry" (in Grimbosh rhymes) shall

But the sweet secular singer's luscious laise,
Phonetic laws to with to change at once
Must prove a man a duffer and a donee,
The laws of spelling are less fatal foze.
(You can spell "does" as either

And if you wish to make it rhyme with bosh,
What easier than writing wath as " wosh"?)
If TENNYSON were all rewritten thus,
His verse indeed would be de-li-ci-us;
And ISAAC PITMAN'S spelling would add lots
Of charm to the great works of ISAAC Worre.
There! Grimbosh sets the world right once

Back to town—which is horrible now—or to
politics—the beastliest bore?
Day and night do the printers'-devils call?
Day and night do stump-orators howl and
squall?
Bless 'em—and let 'em be!
Out from the city of singular sights, and
smells.
Come to these saffron sands and these silvery
shells,
Far from the niggers, and nursemaids, and
howling swells,
Here by the high-toned sea:
0 hither, come hither, and furl your sails!
Come hither to me, and to me,
Hither, come hither, and frolic and play,
(Of course, in a highly-respectable middle-
aged way).
Good company we—if you do not object to
our—tails.
And the least little tiny suspicion of silver
scales.
"We will sing to you. lyrics gay,
Such asLocKEB, or AUSTIN DOBSON, or LANG
might pen.
Oh, we know your society-singers, and now
and then,
When old Father Nep's in the sulks, or
amusement fails,
Or we're tired of the "merry carols" of
rollicking gales
(As young ALFBED TENNYSON said
When just a weeny bit 'off his (poetical)
head')
We study another than Davy Jones's Locker,
And read your Society Novel or Shilling
Shocker!
Oh, spangles are sparkling in bight and bay!
Come down, Old Gentleman, give us your
hand.
We are modern mermaids, as you may under-
stand,
And fair, and frolic, fun-loving, and blame-
lessly free.
Hither, come hither, and see!"
And PcNCHrus, waggishly winking a wary
eye,
Cried, "Coming, my nautical darlings!—at
least, I '11 try.
Middle-aged? I 'm as young as] a masher of
five-and-twenty!
1 love pretty girls, honest fun, and the far
niente.
I'm 'a young man,' but not 'from the
country," as you will find,
And if you are game for flirtation, well, 7
don't mind!"
And he stepped him down, and he sat by the
sounding shore,
And chatted, and flirted, and laughed with
the sirens four;
And he sang, as young TENNYSON might have,
or UHLAND, the German,
This song of the Modern Merman!—
"Who would not be
A merman bold,
And sit by the sea,
With mermaids free.
And sweet converse hold
Witli nice nautical girls,
And toy with their curls,
And watch the gleam
Of their glistening pearls,
As they chatter, chatter
On,—well, no matter!
Each with her tale
And whisks her—narrative.

Charms are all comparative!)
Oh what a happy life were mine
With Beauty (though caudate) beside the

With four sea-fairies beside the sea

And the Mermaids pinched the Punchian cheek
(For his Caudal lecture) and made him squeak.
And he cried " Revenge!" (like TIMOTHEUS,
Miss)
And a sweet revenge for a nip is a kiss.
And around the rock siren laughter rang
And that bevy of sweet sea-fairies sang:—
"0 the laugh-ripple breaks on the breaking
wave,
And sweet are its echoes from cove and cave,
And sweet shall your welcome be,
You dear old Cove,
Whom all she-things love,
0 hither, come hither and be our lord,
For merry mischiefs are we!
0 listen, listen, your eyes shall glisten.
('Tis better than being by B-ETL-YS bored!)
Business? 0 fiddle-de-dee!!!
With pleasure and love make jubilee.
Leucosia, Ligea, Parthenope
Will load your briar and brew your tea.
And we keep rare stingo down under the

For we tithe earth's commerce, all duty-free!
Where will you light on a happier shore.
Or gayer companions or richer store,
All the world o'er, all the world o'er?
Whither away? listen and stay! To Judy

And sick of St. Stephen's, in holiday mood,

FOLLOWING FOOTSTEPS.
(Fragment from a Romance founded on Reality.)
HE had become famous. Or perhaps that was scarcely the word—
notorious would have been better. At any rate his name had
appeared in the papers. For nine days everyone talked about him.
It was during those nine days that he was wanted. No. not by the
myrmidons of the law. He had escaped
them. His plea of innocent had been
accepted. So far as Scotland Yard was
concerned he was safe. Quite safe.
But was he safe from " that other"?
Ah, there was the point. With the
instinct of desperation he took himself
off. He hurried away. He went by an
excursion train—one that stopped at all
the stations and was called a " fast train
to this place" and "that place," but
never referred to in connection with its
destination—and arrived in due time at a cockney watering-place.
He was followed! As sure as fate, came the follower! Ready to
hunt him down! Ready to take him! He rapidly repacked his bag.
He hurriedly left for tie station. Once again he was flying away.
Now he had chosen a prosperous city. The place was teeming with
population. Surely he would be lost in this giddy throng? No. He
was followed! On came the pursuer! Ready to take him!
Again and again the same thing happened. Did he go to the
Continent, his pursuer was after him. Did he travel to Scotland, he
was met in the Highlands by the same fatal presence.
It was useless to fight against destiny any longer. Assisted by those
intereste^'in a popular paper—which had slightly altered its character,
changing from an authority on scientific research into a cheap
sporting weekly—he reached the Antarctic Circle. He heard
following footsteps. He tried to hide himself behind the South Pole.
But it was of no avail. At length he was discovered! . They stood
face to face, both wearing skates. j.
"What do you want with me P"
"You were accused of murder, but was innocent."
"Yes," he returned, with an ugly frown. "I was innocent that
time."
"You are an interesting person. I have followed you all this way
because I have determined to interview you."
"No you don't," cried the pursued, drawing a sword walking-stick,
and holding the blade dagger-wise.
"Yes I do," shouted the pursuer, producing a note-book. "And
now tell me who were your father and mother?"
There was a short, decisive straggle, and then all was over.
"If there is ever an inquest in this distant spot," said the
conqueror, " the jury will bring it in justifiable homicide."
And no doubt he was right in his conjecture.

OUR NATIONAL DEFENCES.
(By Mr. Punch's Ovm Veteran Expert.)
IT was a happy thought of the respected Editor of this paper (if
may be permitted so to say) to commission me to undertake a
thorough inspection of the guns at the Admiralty Pier, Dover. Since
war has broken out between China and Japan there is nofaying what
may happen next, and it seems to me that a plain statement of our
preparedness wi'l have a reassuring effect. So without further
preface I will relate my adven-
tures, taking cure, however, to
give no information that can be
serviceable to the enemy.
I am a bit of a soldier myself
but frankly confess that I was
not nearly so much of a warrior
as my companion. We had a
pass for two, and it was under-
btood that nothing should be done
through indiscretion that might
endanger the safety of the
country. So if my description
is not what the dramatic critics
of the nearly newest school term
"convincing," the omission is
accounted for. "We two, braving
the rain the wind and the spray,
Put in an appearance at the end
of tne Admiralty Pier. There
was a sort of boat-house on our
right, which seemingly contained
clothing for those who intended
to do the guns.
"You had better put on canvas,
Sir," said the custodian; "the
engineers are about, and it is rather dirty down below."
Sly companion was soon suited with a pair of overalls and a
jumper. I would have been fitted as speedily if the date of the
adornment had been anticipated by twenty years or so. As it was,
my weight rather interfered with the measurement. From the size
of the canvas clothing in stock, I am afraid our army must be a
skinny one. Be this as it may, I had to wear "36," when "44"
would have been nearer the mark. The result was that 1 walked
with difficulty, and found I could not cough. So I was rather glad
that there was no chance of meeting the fairer per, as I was quite
sore that I was not looking my best. And I say this although 1 was
tied together with bits of rope, and did wear an old jockey cap.
"We will go and see the powder magazine first," said our guide,
flourishing what seemed to me to be a cheap kind of teapot, with a
light at the end of it. "It is so many feet below the level of the sea
at low water."
I carefully refrain from giving the number of feet—first, because
I will disclose no confidences, and, secondly, because I have forgotten
it. So down we went into the depths of the earth. The hole was
about as )>ig as a kitchen chimney, and had on one side of it a
number of iron bars, serving as a ladder. Our guide went first, then
my companion, then I myself. I shall never forget the experience.
I have often heard of the treadmill, and this seemed a revised
edition of the punishment. Each bar hurt my feet, and each foot of
descent increased my temperature. I went very slowly—it was im-
possible to go fast in overalls "36." When I had descended what
appeared to me to be a mile or so, I came to a full stop. I was
standing in a sort of empty store-cupboard—the kind of place
where careful housewives stack boxes and unused perambulators.
"This is the magazine," said our conductor, waving his illumi-
nated tea-pot about, so that we might see the place to better advantage.
"Is this all?" I asked, rather disappointed, as after so much
exertion I should have been glad of a little excitement. Even an
infernal machine on tick would have been something.
"Yes, that's all, Sir," returned the teapot-bearer, beginning to
mount the ladder. He was followed by my companion. I brought
up the rear, and felt like the great-grandfather of JACK SHEPPAHD
escaping from Newgate. When I was half way it occurred to me
that it was really very wrong to allow people to see such secrets. I
might have been a spy, or a political agent, or something or other.
Yes, such things should not oe permitted, and I recommenced my
exertions.
"Take cire where you go, Sir! There's a loose plank there-
abouts!"
It was the voice of our leuler. It came from above, and had a
ventriloquial sound about it. I felt inclined to reply in a shrill
falsetto, " What a funny man you are Mr. COLE!" but would not.
First, it was undignified; secondly, I hadn't the breath to do it.
"Wearily, drowsily," like Miss MAT YOKE, but (considering my
been for the last ten hours in the hottest room of a local Chinese
Turkish Bath. I was so limp that had I been told that the fairest
of the fair and the richest of the rich combined was on the eve of
being introduced to me, I should not have made any effort to get
away. Yes, in spite of being conscious that I had rubbed my nose
with a smutty glove, and consequently had something in common
with the sweep.
"Wo are going to Eee the engines," said my friend.
"Only so many hundred feet below the level of the ocean," added
our conductor. (It will be observed that I carefully avoid figures for
the reasons I have already given.)
"Thanks, no," I gai-ped out ; "I don't think I will go. I suppose
they are exactly like other engines?"
'• Not in the least."
"Ah, then that decides me, I will stay here," and I did.
I am glad to say that the engines appeared to be particularly in-
teresting, and kept my friend and his escort busily engaged for about
half an Lour. At length my companions returned. I was partially
recovered. I was no longer as limp as a bit of string; I was by this
time almost as strong as a piece ot address cardboard.
"You should have seen the engines," said my friend in a tone of
reproach, "they were excellent."
I replied that I would take his word for it. Then we went to see
the guns themselves. Well, I frankly confess I was disappointed.
They were the usual sort of guns. Big tubes and all that kind of
thing. Rather silly than otherwise.
"They are only fired twice a year," said onr guide, as if that
enhanced their value. And now I began to understand why the
casemates had such an "apartments furnished" air about them.
The windows had brass fittings. I expected to see curtains hanging
from above, and was quite disappointed not to find a canary in a
birdcage hanging down between the window and the gun muzzle.
"Dear me!" I observed, " so these are the guns! They are tired

who fires (i.e. Itts off) the gun. The result of this displav of know-
ledge was an elaborate description by our guide of the character of
the gun bustling with technicalities. (Wishing to protect the
Government secrets I do not transcribe it.)
Then we went to see how the gun was loaded, how it was laid or
aimed. At last we came to the look-out tower.
"Only room for one gentleman," said our guide; aiid I nobly
yielded first place to my friend. He went up, and his htad dis-
appeared. 1 could only see his body from the neck downwards.
He appeared very agitated. Later on no came down, and saying there
was a "stiftiah brieze." invited me to take his place. Ascending
slowly, greatly impulid by fit and fatigue, I got to the top of the
ladder. My head disappeared, and my body I knew must have
become greatly agitateJ. And this was not t-urpriting. For my
body was still in the hottest room of the local Chinese Turki-h Bath,
which had grown hotter than ever, and my head had apparently
suddenly found itself on the summit of Mont Blanc. Yes, and in
winter weather. For a moment it was all I could do to avoid what
seemed to me to be avalanches, fro/en thunderbolts and Atlantic
icebergs. They seemed to be dashing over me. Clinging for dear
life to what appeared to be a sort of glassless cucumber frame was our
conductor. He explained something or other in a voice that sounded
as if he were a ventriloquist who was making a man say "Good
night" at the top of a very high chimney.
I intimated that I was perfectly satisfied. This I did in dumb
show by promptly dropping my head and climbing down as quickly
as possible. When I reached the stone floor my face was ice for a
moment and then turned red hot, following the example set by the
rett of my body.
Shortly afterwards, staggering in my imperfect fit, I once more
returned to the entrance of the boat-house. The robes surrounding me
;re carefully untied in several directions. I drew otf my overalls,
my jumper, my shocking bad hat, my torn white gloves. I resumed
my ordinary clothes. "RICHARD was himself again." At least, as

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

OUR NATIONAL DEFENCES.
(By Mr. Piinch'i Ovm Veteran Expert.)
IT was a happy thought of the respected Editor of this paper (if
may be permitted so to say) to commission me to undertake a
thorough inspection of the guns at the Admiralty Pier, Dover. Since
war has broktn out between China and Japan there is no raying what
may happen next, and it seems to me that a plain statement of our
preparedness wi'l have a reassuring effect. So without further
preface I will relate my adven-
tures, taking care, however, to
give no information that can be
serviceable to the enemy.
I am a bit of a soldier myself
but frankly confess that I was
not nearly so much of a warrior
as my companion. We had a
pass lor two, and it was under-
btood that nothing should be done
through indiscretion that might
endanger the safety of the
country. So if my description
is not what the dramatic critics
of the nearly newest school term
"convincing," the omission is
accounted for. We two, braving
the rain the wind and the spray,
put in an appearance at the end
of the Admiralty Pier. There
was a sort of boat-house on our
right, which seemingly contained
clothing for those who intended
to do the guns.
"You had better put on canvas,
Sir," said the custodian; "the
engineers are about, and it is rather dirty down below."
My companion was soon suited with a pair of overalls and a
jumper. I would have been fitted as speedily if the date of the
adornment had been anticipated by twenty years or so. As it was,
my weight rather interfered with the measurement. From the size
of the canvas clothing in stock, I am afraid our army must be a
skinny one. Be this as it may, I had to wear "36," when "44"
would have been nearer the mark. The result was that 1 walked
with difficulty, and found I could not cough. So I was rather glad
that there was no chance of meeting the fairer fex, as I was quite
sore that I was not looking my best. And I say this although 1 was
tied together with bits of rope, and did wear an old jockey cap.
"We will go and see the powder magazine first," said our guide,
flourishing what seemed to me to be a cheap kind of teapot, with a
light at the end of it. "It is so many feet below the level of the sea
at low water."
I carefully refrain from giving the number of feet—first, because
I will disclose no confidences, and, secondly, because I have forgotten
it. So down we went into the depths ot the earth. The hole was
about as )>ig as a kitchen chimney, and had on one side of it a
number of iron bars, serving as a ladder. Our guide went first, then
my companion, then I myself. I shall never forget the experience.
I have often heard of the treadmill, and this seemed a revised
edition of the punishment. Each bar hurt my feet, and each foot of
descent increased my temperature. I went very slowly—it was im-
possible to go fast in overalls "36." When I had descended what
appeared to me to be a mile or so, I came to a full stop. I was
standing in a sort of empty store-cupboard—the kind of place
where careful housewives stack boxes and unused perambulators.

nated tea-pot about, so that we might see the place to better advantage.

It was the voice of our leader. It came from above, and had a

onr conductor. (It will be observed that I carefully avoid figures for

"Dear me!" I observed, " so these are the guns! They are tired
I supposed by Number One?"
Our conductor was absolutely startled at my remark. Many years
since I was a Volunteer Artilleryman, and I had stumbled on a
technical term. "Number One" is the gunner of the firing-party
who fires (i.r. lets off) the gun. The result of this displav of know-
ledge was an elaborate description by our guide of the character of
the gun bristling with technicalities. (Wishing to protect the
Government secrets I do not transcribe it.)
Then we went to see how the gun was loaded, how it was laid or
aimed. At last we came to the look-out tower.
"Only room for one gentleman," said our guide; aid I nobly

ODE FOR THE MARRIACE
SEASON.
I.
SING now in festal rhyme
Of Hymen's harvest-time,
The happy chances
When Cupid's fragrant torch
Leads to the sacred porch
And the bells' wedding chime
Crowns young romances.
Here, whispering somewhal
loud,
Gathers the wonted crowd;
Matrons with heart still
young
Happily tearful,
Critics of dress, avow'd,
Too sibilant of tongue,
And, thick the throng among,
Damsels expectant still
Of love, their lives to fill,
Chatty and cheerful.
See, there the bridegroom
waits
Till at the flow'r-strewn gate*
His love descendeth,
And all ears listening,
And some eyes glistening,
Fiction's romances pale
While of a real love-tale
First chapter endeth.
The choir-boys, open-( ye 1,
Forget their psalter
For gazing at me bride,
Childlike yet dignified,
Ihere by her lover's side,
Before the altar.
Here to the shrine they
bring
That old pure offering
Of all religions,
Hallowing their first, young
loves—
A pair of turtle- doves,
Or two young pigeons.

"AM I too sweeping when I say that we

emphatic "No!"
It is not every working-man's friend who

them, the grasping oaf italist, the mere greedy

would indeed be " too strong to be afraid of
Parliament," or any other power.
Mr. DELVES spoke of strikes as likely to be-
come " an old weapon like the discarded flint-
lock of a past age." Good again! But if the
workmen will organise an effective strike, as
general as possible, against Beer and Betting, it
will the best day's work they have ever done

would be just as handy. "It was a curious coincidence in names,"
quoth the Baron, "that, when first I took up one of these volumes, I
was discoursing with an eminent judge on some mysterious poiats in
'• the celebrated' Claimant' trial,
a full and detailed report of
which would afford matter for
an 'Arthur-Ortonyni' library
of fiction." The particular
volume which had attracted
the Baron's attention was Mad
Sir Uchtred of the Hills, by
S. R. CROCKETT. 'Tis a strange
book, and the "kindly reader,"
so addressed prefalially by the
author, may have a kindly
word for it, and, "by my
troth," quoth the Baron, "the
reading of it made pass an
hour or so 'twixt meal-times
not unpleasantly," the while
he sat on the smooth deck of a
wave - conquering yacht, in
view of the hoary tide of the Green I-ties of Arrah and Bed ad, what
time the Sea-any-monies and the coal-scuttle fish phot like blue
blazes "through the silver threads of the still and sleepy waters."
And that is how the Baron, would write were he describing the
scene Crockettically. The story of Sir Uchtred was evidently
suggested by the Strange Adcenlures of the Great King Nebu-
chadnezzar, and indeed the guileless author would so have it
understood from the headings prefixed to his chapters. There is
much about "Randolph " in it, which is pleasant, seeing that for
some time "our only Randolph" is absent from us, going round the
world, and getting himself, the Baron hopes, all round again by the
process.
Sir Uchtred goes mad, mad as a hatter—(" What hatter? But no
matter!" quoth the poetical Baron),—and wanders about "with a
tile off," just as a hatter would do who was so demented as to forget
his business. Then at the critical moment he is suddenly restored to
his senses by hearing, in the darkness, far down, a bell ring! Yes, he
had heard it before, a sweet church bell, long ago in his infancy. . . .
Just as the wicked character in Nicholas Nickleby's first play
written for the Crummies Company, the villain of the piece, when
about to commit his greatest piece of villainy, hears a clock strike! He
has heard a clock strike in happier times, in the days of his innoeeney,
and he is struck by the striking coincidence, and he weeps—he
relents! he is good once more!!! And this is how mad Sir Uchtred is
brought back again to his senses, and how all ends happily for every-
body except for a certain lame tamed black wild cat, which, after
having had a great deal to do with the story, disappears, and is heard
of no more. Alas! poor Yorick! Will good Sir R. CROCKETT of the
Pens write another little red book—(" such is the colour of the cover
in the Autonym Library. But for certain 'tis a much read book,"
quoth idiotic Sir Bookred of the Swills)—informing us what became
of the cat with three legs and eight lives, one of its chances having
gone? I haven't met such a oat as this since Mr. ANTHONY HOI>E
introduced us to the appreciative tail-less one belonging to Mr.
Witt's Widow.
And another book in the library is The Upper Berth. It sounds an
aristocratic title, doesn't it? Go not by sound save when the cheering
dinner-gong or luncheon-bugle may summon thee; and then " stand
not on the order of vour going," but go and order whatever there may be
on the menu. "The Upper Berth" says the Baron, still aboard the
gallant vessel, "is the best ghost story I have read for manv a day.
'Tis by MARION CRAWFORD, and not written in his well-known
modern Roman hand. Then ia the same volume, by the same author,
is The Waters of Paradise, which is disappointing, certainly, after
the sensational Upper Berth. Therefore, quoth the Baron, "my
counsel and advice is, read, if you will, The Waters of Paradise,
only take them off at a draught first; don't mix the spirit with the
waters, but take The Upper Berth afterwards. For choice read it
in bed, with the aid of one solitary light, taking care to select a
tempestuous night, when boards creak, windows rattle, and doors
open of th(ir own accord. In these conditions you will thoroughly
enjoy MARION CRAWFORD'S Upper Berth, and will gratefully thank
the thoughtful and considerate BARON DE BOOK-WORMS."
P.S.—Once more ashore, and abed, convalescenting, in view of the
poLiphiisboytoning thalasses (Yes, my boy 0! the Baron knoweth the
Greek is not thus, but why not lug in the name of sea-going BOTTOM
on such an appropriate occasion'(), the Baron readeth Ships that pass
in the Night. A deeply pathetic story in one volume, which the Baron
cannot regret not having read long ere this, as it suits bis mood so
commend the book everywhere, and to everybody, but that by now no
such passport is necessary. Certain personages and localities in the
story recall to the Baron's mind a pretty play, and a most successful
one, produced at the St. James's Theatre under Mr. ALEXANDER'S
management. It was Liberty Hall, by SIDNEY CARTON, and the
characters were the friendless girl, played, I fancy, by MARION
TEREY; the somewhat cynical and mysterious lonely man, played by
Mr. GEORGE ALEXANDER ; and, finally, Toddy, the old bookseller and
book-collector, a part that suited Mr. RIGHTON down to the ground.
Such undesigned coincidences are interesting to reader and playgoer,
and in no way detract from the author's originality. B DE B W

(Circa 2894 A.D.)
Amanda (looking over AMANDUS'S shoulder). What are you so
absorbed in, my dear?
Amandus (rousing himself). Why darling, in this very clever,
though painful, antiquarian work by Dr. DIGEMUP called " Dips into
the Dismal Ages." (Shudders sympathetically.) Dear, dear, how it
makes one pity one's poor, respectable, but ridiculous ancestors of
about a thousand years syne,—say the end of the "so-called Nine-
teenth Century!"
Amanda. Why dear, what did they do P
Amandus. You should rather ask, what did they suffer? I was
reading a graphic, but harrowing, account of an extraordinary
annual "Custom" they had—they, the conventional, commonplace,
conformists of the day, top-hatted Philistines, "civilised" into
characterlessness, polished into pithlessness, humanised into moral
pap and pulp. It seems to have been a custom almost as cruel as
the blood-bath of Dahomey, as irrational and tormenting as the
hari-kari of old Japan.
Amanda. Dear me! Poor dear deluded duffers, why did they
doit?
Amandus. That even the pundits of the " Shrimpton-on-Sea " Ex-
ploration Society cannot so muchasconjecture. Their excavatorslately
cime upon a most mysterious "marine deposit" in a sand-choked
chalk-cave in the course of repairing the great South-Coast Marine
Embankment. Here are pictures of some of the items. Many of
them are mysteries whose nature and use cannot be fathomed. Here
is an apparatus supposed to have been a barbarous musical instru-
ment, a hoop with a piece of parchment stretched across it, and
ornamented with movable brazen discs. It may have been used to
scare gulls. At any rate, it must have made a hideous din when
beaten or agitated. It was discovered near certain strange semi-
polished fragments of what were apparently the rib-bones of some
extinct animals. Their use now cannot even be surmised; neither
can that of a curious wooden implement somewhat resembling a
miniature model of the obsolete agricultural implement once known,
it appears, as a " shovel" or " spade."
Amanda. How very odd! Still, hardly dreadful, dear, so far, eh?
Amandus (grarely). Perhaps not! Though the significance even
of these comparatively harmless absurdities is painful. But my dear,
Dr. DIGEMUP'S researches lead him to the belief that in the latter
hajf of the Nineteenth Century a hideous "Annual Custom" pre-
vailed. In the autumn of the year, it would seem, a sort of Sjcial
Edict of Banishment drove all decent and well-to-do citizens from
their own happy homes, to make themselves miserable—by wav of
penance probably—in strange places, fusty, ill-furnishfd, often
unhealthy, and always expensive, far from all the comforts and
decencies, the conveniences and charms of their own well-ordered
residences.
Amanda. But ichy did they do this dismal thing?
Amandus. It is not conceivable that they jcoi<Wdo it save or com-
pulsion. It is conjectured that some secret religious tribunal or venge-
ful Social Vehmgericht drove the devoted victims to this dreadful
doom. They had to pass weeks, and sometimes months, either in
continual travel—as tiring and painful as the penitential pilgrim-
ages of a yet earlier date—or in compulsory incarceration in dismal
dungeons or comfortless caravanserais.
Amanda (shirering). Oh dear, how rery dreadful!
Amandus. Dreadful, indeed! The leaders, controllers, or " gang-
ers " of these Autumnal Pilgrimages of Pain, were certain mysterious
functionaries called, it appears, by the generic name of "Pater-
familias." The Paterfamilias, who appears to correspond somewhat
to the ancient idea of a Pilgarlic or Scapegoat, had, tli nigh "sore
against his will," like the mythical John Gilpin, to had his family
followers in this peripatetic purgatory, suffer its worst horrors him-
self, and—pay all the expenses! 7.'
Amanda. SHOCKING!!! And what did they cull this horriil
custom?
Amandus. As far as can be ascertained, it seems to have been
exactly now. lie thanks Miss BKATRICE HARRADEN, and would re-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
IN PARIS OUT OF THE SEASON.
(if"/'.•'> some Notes on a Detective Melodrama at the Amliiyii.)
DEAR MB. PUNCH,—When I announced my intention of ninning
over to Paris for a few (lavs, my friend BUZZARD looked at me with u
stony contempt. "To Paris?" he said, "at this time of year!
Why, you must be mad. What on earth are you going to do
there? I tried to explain to BUZZARD, whose frigid superiority
Frightens mo, that I liked Paris, that I was going there pour me
degourdir ; that it was just as possible to
breakfast at LEDOYEN'S or VOISIN'S, and
to dine at DORAND'S or JOSEPH'S in Sep-
tember as at any other time; that a few
theatres were still open; that the Boule-
vards were there for the flaneur; but I
failed to penetrate his scorn, even with
the most idiomatic French at my com-
mand. However, I determined that Buz-
ZABD, like the weight of the elephant in
the problem, must be neglected; and
here I am in the Rue de Rivoh with
another madman like unto myself. We
take our cafe complet in bed; we wear
beautiful French ties, made of foulard,
with two vast ends floating like banners
in the Parisian breeze—in a word, we are
thoroughly enjoying ourselves in an entirely non-British fashion—
which I take, indeed, to be of the essence of a pleasant holiday.
What care we for the echoes of the Trades Union Congress; for the
windiest of K KI it HAHDIE'S blatancies; for the malignities of Mr.
CHAMBERLAIN, or the failure of Lord ROSEBERY'S Ladas at Don-
caster? We are in Paris, and the sight of a cuirassier trotting past
with his great black criniere waving behind, or of the lady bicyclists
scudding by in knickerbockers, excites us more than even the latest
ravings of the newest woman in London. BUZZARD be blowed! You
may tell him I said so.
I want to let Mr. CONABT DOYLE know that there is a great open-
ing for him here. If I may judge by the latest detective drama, the

f/k
_ iay
ideas of the Parisian public with regard to the acumen and general
power of a detective are still very primitive. Yet GABORIAU did
something in this line, and, in the Vicamte de Sragehnne, did not
d'Artagnun show himself on the occasion of a certain duel to be a
detective of unmatchable force? Still the fact remains that the
play-going Parisian public is easily satisfied in the matter of detect-
ives. Listen, if you doubt me, to a plain unvarnished account of
"La Belle Liinonadiere" the "Grand drame noureau en cinq
actes, knit tableaux," which is now running gloomily, but with
immense success, at the Ambigu.
Madame de Mazerolles, a wealthy widow, is, in the first Act.
robbed and brutally murdered by her ste_pspn, Roland, a dissipated
young man, who is incited to the commission of the crime by his
wicked mistress Sabine. Vidocq, the great representative of the new
school in detection (circa A.D. 1820), is away at the time, and in his
absence the investigation falls to his rival Yvrier, who belongs to the
old school. In the chamber of death Yrrier soon makes up his mind
that the guilty person is one Henri Lebrun, a faithful and gigantic
old soldier, much given to beating bis breast with both fists and
talking at large about his services to his country, his immaculate
honesty and his domestic virtues. Suddenly Vidocq enters. He dis-
covers that the assassin has entered by a certain door because a cob-
web has been disturbed, he picks up a red flower dropped by th<
assassin, he pours contempt on the crass stupidity of Yvrier—all
quite in the best Sherlock Holmes style. But nothing comes of it all.
Poor Henri Lebrun, still beating his breast with tilts, is arrested, and
after a painful interview with his only daughter (whom he discovers
to have been the mistress of George, the son of Madame Mazerolles)
he becomes tublime, accuses himself quite unnecessarily of the murdei
he had never committed, and is marched off to prison amid the
execrations of the populace, the triumph of the crass Yrrier, and the
loudly expressed determination of I idocq to bring the guilty to
justice and save the life of the innocent Lebrun. Time passes
Lebrun, overwhelmed by an entire absence of proofs, is tried and
condemned to death. It is the morning appointed for his execution.
The curtain rises in the upper floor of a restaurant commanding an
extensive view of the guillotine. The sight-seers troop in. First of
all comes Roland, the murderer, disguised in black as a wicked
Marquis, and accompanied by the infamous Sabine. Ht'lrne Lebrun,
the daughter of the condemned man, also troops in to slow music in
black. There is a commotion at the door, and the obsequious inn-
keeper backs on to the stage ushering in Milord Sir John Stilton and
his son "Shames." Sir John is dressed in an enormous green
swallow-tailed coat with brass buttons, a striped yellow waistcoat, a
pai of yellow knickerbockers, and stockings Drilhantly striped with
red and black. On his head he wears a low-crowned hat. In one
hand he carries an umbrella, while a telescope dangles from his
shoulders by a strap. In short, he is toul-ce-qu'il-y-a de plus
Anglais. His son Shames is even more aggressively British. Sir
John orders lunch: "COM* donner moa bifleck" is the obvious
formula. Shames concurs with a " Yehs, Pappah," which provokes
roars of laughter. But stay, what is this? Sir John takes Shames
aside: they talk in beautiful French. Can it be? Yes, by Heaven,
t is the great Vidocq with his faitiful Coco-Latour! We breathe
again, for now we know that the innocent man is safe. The pro-
iession, however, approaches. The condemned man speaks from
M-lu\v to his daughter in the balcony. He declares his innocence.
Jow good Vidocq, to the rescue. Display all your arts, convict the
rnilty, disguised Marquis, and save the estimable Lebrun! But
Vidocq looks on impassive, a dull thud is heard and the head of the
nnocent _ rolls into the basket. Immediately afterwards Yrrier
staggers in. Too late, he says, he has been convinced of Lebrun'«
nnpcence. At the last moment Lebrun looked at him with eyes in
which there was no trace of guilt. That last look did it, ana now
Yvrier in a passion of repentance offers himself to help Vidocq, even
in the most subordinate capacity, to track down the guilty, and to
remove the stain from Lebriin's name. I pass over the padding,
daring which Vidocq appears, for no earthly reason, in numerous dis-
ruises, and come to the last scene. Roland has all but killed George
Mazerolles in a duel, he has murdered Sabine, who, before dying,
rounds on him, and he is now, by a strange conjunction of circum-
stances, in the very room in which he murdered Madame Mazerolles.
Thither also cornea everybody else. Vidocq, who is tracking Roland,
discovers, through a paper belonging to the late Madame Mazerolles,
that Roland, her murderer, washer son, not her step-son, and that he,
Vidocq, is the father of Roland. In his youth Vidocq had been a soldier.
Somewhere he had met Madame Mazerolles. "Nous nous tommes
aimfs entre deux batailles, entre deux rictoires," and Roland was the
fruit of their love. Horror of horrors! What is he to do? First he
tells Roland that he killed, not his step-mother, but his mother. At
this awful intelligence, Roland faints in an armchair for precisely ten
seconds. Recovering himself, he is fain to escape. Vidocq, all his
fatherly instincts aroused, says he shall. The weak Yvrier consents,
when suddenly, from behind a curtain, appears Helene Lebrun in
black. The murderer of her father must not escape, she declares,
whereupon the great detective, vowing that his son shall never be
food for the guillotine, shoots him dead with a toy pistol in the
region of the left waistcoat pocket. Tableau! Curtain!
There, Mr. Punch, you have the French Sherlock on the stage.
A wonderful man, is he not? Yours, as always, A VAGRANT.
ON THE WAR IN THE EAST.
(By a Western Wanderer.)
ALL in the East seems so dawdling and queer I
Bogus engagements, and battles pour rire,
Militant meetings—where nobody meets-
Ghostly armies and phantom fleets;
"Terrible slaughter "—with never a blow,
Corpse-choked rivers that maps do not show;
Wild contradiction and vagueness extreme,
Faith, it all reads like some Flowery Land dream,
Arabian-nightish, and opium-bred,
Japanese-spookish, delirium-fed.
Wild, willqw-patternish; sort of a " War"
JOHNNY might paint on a blue ginger-jar.
Wonder how long such a queer war will wag on?
No one can tell—when 'tis Dragon v. Dragon!
THANKS TO THE "BYSTANDER."
I Asr glad to see the "BYSTANDER" in the Graphic has recently
uttered a startled protest against the fashion, now somewhat over-
done, and occasionally objectionably done, of lady-begging for
charitable purposes in the London streets. On the sudden apparition
of one of these merry half-sisters of charity (were not the Pecksniffian
daughters Charity and Merry?) Mr. ASHBY STERRY became well-
nigh hysterrycal, and his generosity being temporarily paralysed,
he fled," with pockets tightly buttoned. For the moment he was nc
longer the "BYSTANDER," whose motto is that of Captain Cuttle.
"Stand by," but, as though he had heard the command to " Stand
and deliver," our sturdy "BYSTANDER" became a fugitive from
before the face of the giddy charity girl, and thus at one " go " saved
his halfpence and his honour. For his reputation would have suffered
had he impolitely rebuffed his fair unfair assailant. He did well tc
liee, he did still better to write and publicly complain. We trust thai
this process adopted by the Sterry O'Type (a tine old Irish title by the
way) may have its due influence, and that the abuse, which hai
become thus Story O'typed, of a fashion good in itself and its origin,
may soon cease to exist. En attendant, Mr, Punch is pleased t<
knowtha the "BYSTAKDER" is still running on, and not likely tc
come to a standstill.

A ST. LEGrER COINCIDENCE.
DEAR MB. PPNCH,—Will you afford
me a small portion of your space to put
on record once and for ever a most extra-
ordinary coincidence? Last "Wednesday
afternoon I was taking a country walk,
when all at once my eye was suddenly
caught by a throstle. At the same time
I accidentally looked at my watch. It
had stopped at 12.10. When I got home
I mentioned both of these circumstances
to my wife.
Later in the evening I bought an even-
ing paper, and was amaztd to find that
the St. Leger had been won by Throstle
(the bird I had seen), which had started
at 50 to 1 (the exact minute at which
my watch had stopped)! Could the force
of coincidence farther go? The Society
of Psychical Research and Mr. STEAD
are welcome to this incident. The only
thing which troubles me at all is that
the evidence (other than my own) is a
little slender. Mv wife is deaf, and
never heard what I told her. The bird
has flown. My watch is going again.
I inclose my card, and am,
Tours STEAD-T to a degree,
ONE WHO Wo.v NOTHING ON
THE RACE.

M. Rid. For me, dear Mademoiselle, for me the regrets—to hear
no more the conversation, so spiritual, so sympathetic, of a fellow-
countrywoman. For remark that here they are stupid—they com-
prehend not. And the old ones they roll at me the eyes to make
terror. Behold this Gorgon who approaches. She adores me, my
word of honour, this ruin!
[Miss STICKLER comes up to the sofa smiling in happy uncon-
sciousness.
Miss Slick, (graciously). So you've felt equal to joining us for once,
Mossoo! We feel it a very 'igh compliment, I can assure you
here of your having known me at Mrs. DICKENSON'S. I couldn't
afford to have it get about in the circle I 'm in that I 'd ever lived
with any but the nobility. I 'm sure you see what I mean. Of
course I don't mind your saying we 've met.
Phill. Oh, I auite understand. I '11 say nothing. I 'm obliged to
be careful myself, being maid to Lady MAISIE MULL.
Miss Dolrn. My dear EMMA! It is nice seeing you again—such
friends as we used to be!
Phill. At her Grace's? I 'm afraid you're thinking of somebody
else. (She crosses to Mrs. POMFBET.) Mrs. POMFBET, what's
become of the gentleman I travelled down with—the horse doctor?
I do hope he means to come in ; he would amuse you, Mr. STEPTOE.
I never heard anybody go on like him; he did make me laugh so!
Mrs. Pomfr. I really can't say where he is, my dear. I sent up
word to let him know he was welcome here whenever he pleased;
but perhaps he's feeling a little shy about coming down.
Phill. Oh, I don't think he suffers much from that. (As the door
opens.) Ah, there he is!
Mrs. Pomfr. (rising, tcith dignitt/, to receive UNDERSJTELL, who
•ters in obvious embarrassment). Come in, Sir._ I 'm glad to see

We've really been feeling quite 'urt at the way you keep to yourself
—you might be a regular 'ermit for all we see of you!
M. Rid. For invent, dear Mees, for create, ze arteeste must live ze

res-tore myself viz your smile.
Miss Stick, (flattered). Well, I've always said, Mossoo, and

I haven't the advantage of

Mr. UNDERSIIELL, we 're
very pleased to see you. I
hope you'll make yourself
quite at home. Her lady-

to Lady CULVERIN for her
(•cith a gulp) condescension
But I t-hull not trespass
more than a short time upon

Mm. Pomfr. Don't speak
of it as trespassing, Sir.
It's not often we have a
gpntlnuan of your profes-
sion as a visitor, but you
are none the le*s welcome.
Now I 'd bftter introduce
you all round, and then you
won't feel yourself a stran-

ance—if this is your first experience of this particular form of

I'nd. (to himself). I mustn't be stiff, I '11 put them at their ease.

very charming room.
[The company draw thi-mselres up and cough in disapprobation.
Slept, (very stiffly). Pardon me, Sir, you have been totally mis-
informed. Such an expression is not current here.
Mrs. Pomfr. (more stiffly still). It is never alluded to in my
presence except as the 'Ousekeeper's Room, which is the right am
proper name for it. There may be some other term for it in the
Servants' 'All for anything / know to the contrary—but if you '11
excuse me for say ing" so, Mr. UNDERSHELL, we 'd prefer for it not to
be repeated in our presence.
J'nd. (confusedly). I—I beg ten thousand pardons. (To himself.)
To be pulled up like this for trying to be genial—it's really too
humiliating!
Slept, (relaxing). Well, well. Sir; we must make some allowances
for a neophyte. You '11 know better another time, 7 daresay. Miss
PHTLLIPSON here has been giving you a very favourable character as
a highly agreeable rattle, Mr. UNUERSHELL. I hope we may
be favoured with a specimen of your social talents later on. We Ve
always grateful here for anything in that way—such as a recitation
now, or a comic song, or a yumorous imitation—anything, in short,
calculated to promote the general harmony and festivity will be

Our juvenile geniuses have altered all that. "The New Art" is
better denned as "the creation of novel forms of ugliness." Its
inspiration is Corruption, its auxiliaries are the two hideous imps,
Scratch and Smudge. Old Art, with its bosh about beauty, its rot
about romance, its fudge about finish, its twaddle about taste, will
be good enough to take a back seat. Apollo the Inspirer must give
way to the sooty imp and incubus, New Scratch !—

WILL you follow where the Bandicoots inevitably stray,
As they amorously hurtle through the stubble and the hay;
Where the Jebusites and Amorites are gathered in a bunch,
While they watch the duck-billed Platypus preparing for his lunch?
Where the toothsome Trichinopli keeps turning on the spit—
Oh my dove-like Trichinopoli, how hard you are to hit!
There is something so elusive and desserting in your shape,
That I had to shoot you sitting and to load my gun with grape.
Though the Mandrake give you goose-
skin by its inharmonious shriek,
And a tug of war come thenning after
(ireek has met with Greek;

milkman till his pail
For an orchestra of Clepsydras con-
ducted by a Snail.

With his Barnacles and Biffin-boys

He has always eggs at breakfast, has the merry Manatee.
Can you see me then subsiding very stately very sly,
Like a soluble quadratic which has lost its x and y,
Getting out my rusty rapier and dissecting with a lunge
All the daffodils and daisies that I grow upon my sponge?
Can you see me on a tram-car, while I stand upon my head,
Shredding out the scarlet runners which no publisher has read,
In a horse-case predetermined by a puisne-judge alone.
Who is tired of seeing juries with a rider of their own *
If the dactyls and the spondees should eventually pall,
You can call on Miss CAESURA and conduct her to a ball.
You can feed the girl on trochees, and of course you can propose,
If hexameters delight you when recited through the nose.
Happy days, how soon ye falter; can a Bachelor have Miss';
Can a contrapuntal Bulbul woo her lover with a kiss P
Can a Sc-jtsmun get protection for his philibeg and trews
By dictating half a column to the Illustrated jfeics?
Can a Bumble-bee be cheerful if related to a Mouse
Which has left its cheesy larder and been captured by a Grouse?
Can a man-of-war be manly, can a gum-boil stick like glue?
Can accounts be cooked with " stumers," and converted into stow?
Nay. I fly from all these problems; I am fortunately deaf
To the fascinating music of the careful Q,. E. F.,
Nor can theorems allure me, never, never will I be

MAD AS A HATTEB.—The Drapery World says that "the New
Woman's hat" is much like the Ordinary Man s "topper," only a
little smaller, and a little more cheeky. The phrase might fitly be
transferred to the "New Woman" herself. She looks so much
like an ordinary man, only a little smaller and a little more cheeky.
By the way, is there much difference between " the New Woman's
hat" and the woman's new hat? The query would make a good
one for a French Exercise Book.

Is the worst enemy of the popular weal.

Oh my dove-like Trichinopoli, how hard you are to hit!
There is something so elusive and dessertmg in your shape,
That I had to shoot you sitting and to load my gun with grape.

Shredding out the scarlet runners which no publisher has read,
In a horse-case predetermined by a puisne-judge alone.

Nay. I fly from all these problems; I am fortunately deaf
To the fascinating music of the careful Q,. E. F.,

MAD AS A HATTEB.—The Drapery World says that "the New
Woman's hat "is much like the Ordinary Man s " topper," only a
little smaller, and a little more cheeky. The phrase might fitly be
transferred to the "New Woman" herself. She looks so much
like an ordinary man, only a little smaller and a little more cheeky.
By the way. is there much difference between "the New Woman's
hat" and the woman's new hat? The query would make a good
one for a French Exercise Book.

IN THE MUSEUM.
'TWAS almost dusk; the galleries
Lay silent and deserted
Where happy knots of twos and threes
Had wondered, talked, and flirted;
Where, armed with buns and cata-
logues,
The country-bred relations
Had criticised, appraised, despised
The art of many nations.
No more the rigid censor viewed
With hearty disapproval
Athenian statues in the nude,
Demanding their removal;
No more the cultured connoisseur,
Whom nothing^ new amazes,
The very old designs extolled
In very modern phrases.
Yet two remained ; a youth and maid
Still lingered in the section
Where Egypt's treasures lie displayed
For popular inspection;
They talked in whispers, and although
The subject dear to some is,
They did not seem to take as theme
The obelisks and mummies.
An Art more ancient far, one thinks,
Was that they talk/d of lightly,
Compared with which the lii'ary

Seems juvenile and sprightly;

THAT ADVANCED AVOMAN!
(A Symposium a. la Mode.)
The Author of I AM much flattered by your kind invi-
"A Saddis Aster" tation to discuss the Advanced Woman, but
confesses. an initial difficulty suggests itself to me.
Can one discuss the Advanced Woman if this Advanced Woman her-
self is non-existent? I am aware, of course, that
she hns i-tridden large of late in the pages of femi-
nine fiction, but is she not as extinct (before she
has ever existed) as her DODO title? Let me make
my own confession. I have used, if I did not
invpnt, the A. W. I have secured a remunerative
public. Once on a time I wrote of life as I found
it. I used my eyes and ears, and endeavoured to
let the world have the result in the old-fashioned,
wholesome story. It was a dreary failure. The
critics commended my style, and the public let me
severely alone. Nous aeons change tout cela. A
theatrical manager who finds his musical piece
begin to drag, saves the situation by a New
Edition—in other words, by two new songs and
some fresh dances. In a similar way I secured a
reputation by dragging in (at times by her very
hi el«) the Advanced Woman. True that she resembles no one in
actual existence, true, indeed, that she is outrageously and offen lively
improbable, but the public were not hippy till they got her. They 're
happy now. So am I.
Mrs. Shriek Shriokon I should have thought that >ny views on
speaks out. the Advanced Woman were sufficiently well
known; but, since you aOc my opinion, I may
say at once that I lose no opportunity of inveighing against this/H
de-sicclc abomination. Once on a time it wag not thought un-

sphere, and, queen in her own selected world, she did not aspire to a
sovereignty which naturally belonged to others. If they were alive
to-day (and, after all, some of them are), our grandmothers would
hardlv know their GRAND children—the Heavenly Twins. I am glad
that I am permitted to keep burning the sacred lamp of the Old
Womanhood. Indeed, it looks as if the jeers which a thoughtless
world has hitherto reserved for the Old Maid were being transferred
to the Old Woman. Yet to those who have never yielded to the spell
of the latter-day notions, there is only dismay in the spectacle of the
Advanced Woman sweeping triumphantly on, with her mind full of
sex-problems the has not brains enough to understand, and her
breath stained with the trace of cigarettes she does not oare to
conceal. Wholesomeness dies at being dubbed old-fashioned;
Modesty does not survive the disgrace of not being up to date. It's
a bad world, my masters, and I 'm never tired of saying so.
Ann I". Woman The fact, that you have invited my opinion
dreanu w;th full knowledge of what I shall say, em-
of the Future. baldens me to speak out. Man's day (which,
like every dog, he h»s had) draws to an end. For centuries he has
had Woman at his mercy. What she is to-dav, that he has made
her. And what is she? His Doll, his Slave, his "Old Woman."
But Man made one fatal mistake. In a weak moment he consented
to allow Woman to earn her own living. From that moment our
ultimate triumph was assured. Now we know our strength. Told
of old that we were brainless, we now become Senior Wranglers.
Condemned aforetime to inactivity, we now realise that in life's
struggle there are no prizes we are not competent to secure, though,
of course, we are not always permitted. We have precipitated our-
selves out of a yellow miasma of stagnant sloth into an emancipated,
and advanced day. The Advanced Woman has come to stay—but
not with anv husband. She will be as free as the air, as strong as
the eagle. I must stop, as to do any more fine writing would be to
anticipate my next novel. Be sure to get it. It will be called

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
"TRIPPING MERRILY."
THAT holiday cruise on board the good steamship Connie Djnia!
Did I dream it? or was it a reality? "Are there wisions about?"
It seems like yesterday or like years ago, and I know it was neither.
"Old KASPAS'H,"—or let us say middle-aged KASPAB'S,—" work was
done" pro tern., and he could not neglect so great an opportunity, nor
refuse so inviting an invitation as that sent him by Sir CHARLES
CHEERIE, the Chairman, to come aboard for the trial trip of the
G.S.S. Connie Donia. So I, middle-aged KASPAR, work done as
aforesaid, did then and thereby become TOMMY the Tripper, and,
as such, went aboard the gallant SS. abovementioned, afl-to-the-
oontrary, nevertheless, and notwithstanding.
And what a goodly company!
Sir CHARLES and Lady CHBERIE, perfect host and hostess in
themselves. Here too was pur TOBY, M.P., waggish as ever. "I
am not down on the official list of
guests as 'TOBIAS,'" quoth he.
"And why?" I gave it up. "Be-
cause," says he, answering his
own conundrum, "I am a free
and independent scribe, and there
is nothing to bias me. Aha!"
The sea air agrees with TOBY, M.P.
"And where would the Member
for Barkshire be," he asks, pro-
I minding as it were another and a
better puzzle, "but aboard a
bonnie barque? My bark," he
continues gaily, "may be worse
than my bite, bat Here the
bugle-call to breakfast sounds,
and from ocular evidence I can
roundly assert that whatever his
bark may be, I will back his bite
—and this without backbiting, of
which, as I trust, neither of us is
capable—against that of any two
of his own size and weight. Yet
TOBY en mangeant is not Ihe
dog in a manger, no, not by any
means! With one eye to the
main chance, and another to the
corresponding comfort of his co-
breakfasters, so pursueth he his
steadfast course, as indeed do we
all, to the astonishment of most
of us, through the shoals of toast
and butter; over the shallows of
eggs; safely through the Straits
of Kipper and Kurrie; with a
pleasant time in Hot Tea Bay;
then through a Choppy sea, be-
tween the dangerous rocks of
Brawn and Bacon; into the calm
Marmaladean Sea, where we ride
at anchor and all is well.
After breakfast, the cigar, or
pipe, with conversational accom-
paniment, what time we pace
the quarter-deck. Prognostica-
tions as to probable weather are
"taken ana offered" by nauti-
cally-attired guests, who, in a general way, may lie supposed from
their seagoing costume "to know the ropes." Here is the ever j
amiable and truly gallant Sir PETER PLURAL, looking every inch the
ideal yachtsman, as honorary member of the Upper House of C'owes
and Kvde Piers. Wonderful man Sir PETER! knows everybody, is'
liked by everybody; has been yachting and sailing and voyaging
for any number of years; knows even the smallest waves by sight,
and. if asked, could probably tell you their names! One day he will
publish his reminiscences!
We anchor off Queenstown. The estimable, jovial VALENTINE
VULCAN, M.P., from the North, must ashore to purchase some trifling
knickknacks by way of mementoes of the visit. Instead of " knick-
knacks" he lays in a stock of "knock-knocks," yclept "shille-
laghs," which are served out to him by a delicately pale beauty of
Erin, dark-haired, slim waisted. and as elegant aa might be any
natty girl from County Trim. She shows us eome dozen shillelaghs
with hard, murderous-looking, bulbous knobs.
"Phew!" whistles VALENTINE VULCAN, M.P., weighing one of
these dainty sticks in his hand. "You might get rather a nasty
crack from this." I agree with him, and the sad daughter of Erin
regards us sadly and sympathetically.
'Maybe," I think to myself, "she has lost a friend or a lover in one
Saxon (referring to the thilklaght).
these should be permitted!"
Daughtet of Erin (plaintively)."
an' they not allowed Fire-arms '"."
And I eye her with a look wherein admiration is tempered with pity.
It occurs to me that I will say something appropriate, just to show
her how I, a stranger and a Saxon, feel for her. It may lead her to
express her hearty detestation of these faction-fights, and of these
deadly fracas with the armed constabulary. So I eay, with a touch
of deep indignation in my tone, "It's a shame," say I, " that such
things as these "—and I nod frowningly at the shillelaghs which
VULCAN, M.P., is twirling meditatively, one in each hand, as if right
and left were about to fight it out—" it 'a a shame that such things
as these should be permitted!" The pale, sad, beautiful daughter of
Erin, regards me mournfully, and then, in a tone expressive of
astonishment blended with firm remonstrance, she asks,—
"An* what irould the poor Boys use, an' they not allowed fire-arms ?''
That was all. No smile is on the lips of Erin's pale daughter.
She is apparently in earnest, though both VULCAN and myself,
talking it over subsequently, unite in opinion that, perhaps, she had
been availing herself of this rare
and unique opportunity of "get-
ting at" the Saxon.
So she went on recommending
sticks and photographs, and did a
good bit of business with our
generous VULCAN, M.P., who re-
turned, laden with gifts for
various fellow-guests aboard the
good S3. Connie Donia.
What amusing nights and de-
lightful days! The ladies—bless
'em !—all charming, and very
Barkisses in their perpetual
"willingness" to do anything
and everything that might give
pleasure and afford amusement.
Two fairy-gifted maidens enter-
tain us mightily with a capital
dramatic sketch of their own com-
position ; others follow suit, play-
ing the piano; and a sesiette per-
form, without previous rehearsal,
glees, madrigalt<, part-songs, and
choruses to popular plantation
melodies, under the leadership of
that masterly mut-ician TOM TOL-
DEROL, whose only regret is that
he has not been able to bring on
board with him his sixteen-horse-
power-nfty-stopped-bix teen-pedal
organ (designed and made by the
eminent firm of BELLOWS, BLOWER
& Co., at a cost of some few thou-
sand pounds), though, as he ex-
plains to us, he would have done
so, had this musical mammoth
been only compressible within the
limits of an ordinary carpet bag.
However, a propos of organs,
we have with us a representative
of one of the greatest organs—of
the Press—full of wise saws and
modern instances; as jolly as a
sandboy, or rather as a schoolboy
put for a holiday. A tailor every
inch of him, and this is saying a

THE INVASION OP WOMAN.
WHEN STREPHON shuts the ledger to,
Relinquishing his duties,
And takes the train from Waterloo
For Clapham's rural beauties
He dearly loves en route, we read,
To smoke the solitary weed.
His hopes, alas, are
j quickly dashed,
', For CHLOE, maid
•i * provoking!
j^ Alertly enters, un-
abashed,
The carriage la-

Yes, CHLOE comes, and brings no doubt,
A friend to talk of fashions,
While SlREi'HON lets his weed go out,
A prey to angry passions,
Which, later on, released will be
Within the excellent D. T.
Yet grieve not ao: ungallant swain,
Nor curse this innovation,
Or, even if you do, refrain
From words like " frequentation,"
But really, you should do no less
Than cease to curse, and wholly bless.
For if the charm this female band
Finds in you so immense is,
That they contentedly can stand
The smell your weed dispenses,
A compliment they pay you then
You will not gain from fellow-men!

A CERTAIN CUEE.
[" Eating sugarplums ia the be»t cure for mun-
dane sorrows."—A Ladief Journal, Sept. 1U.]
WHATEVEE the sorrows that chasten your
life,
A cure for them all you will quickly
receive,
If PHYLLIS should prove an unsuitable wife,
If children undutif ul cause you to grieve,
Just get at the nearest confectioner's shop,
The cheap and the comforting chocolate
drop!
If the treatise at which you have constantly
worked,
(Four volumes portraying " the Growth of
Mankind.")
By editors still is consistently burked.
If publishers still to its merits are blind,
You grieve at their foolish perversity; well,
There's healing and balm in the sweet
caramel.
Perhaps you may find—many do—that your
debts
Are steadily growing, while incomes
decay,
And constant attempts to increase your
assets
By bold speculation seem hardly to pay;
Though "Turks" may decline, do not grieve
at your plight,
But buy, as a substitute, Turkish Delight!
In fact, if misfortunes should seem to
oppress, [endure,
No longer their burden you '11 sadly
You '11 have in the midst of calamity's stress
A certain specific that cannot but cure;
"Away with all sorrow!" our teacher
repeats,
"Don't grieve at existence, but taste of its
ttctfli.'"
TO ALTHEA IN CHURCH.
Yon weren't so far off but I knew you,
I instantly knew you were there!
On my Ancient and Modern I drew you
Between the first hymn and the prayer.
1 'm glad that my eyes keen and quick are,
When there are such prospects to see.
You 're looking straight xip at the Vicar—
I wish you 'd look over at me!
You 've a hat that is gauzy and shady,
Your gown is a delicate grey—
So fair and so dainty a lady
Ne'er entered the Church till to-day!
Your chaperon quietly dozes.
Would I were a wizard, for you!
A wave of my wand, and with roses
Should suddenly blossom your pew!
ROBERT'S PICTER.
lir some stordinary mistake on the part of
some wery hemenent taker of Poortroits, I
was last week requested for to go to him and
set for my Picter.
He told me in his letter that his reason for
wanting me to set to him was, becoz he wanted
to have the Picters of all the Members of the
Copperation, and of course they wood not be
complete without mine, for tho of course he
knew that I was not a real Common Coun-
seller, still, he thort that I had left sitch a
mark among them by my ten years constant
service and unwarying atention to em, that
the hole matter woud be wanting in com-
pleteness if my Picter was omitted, even if
it was only as 'r Mr. ROBERT the City Waiter"
a leading off the presession or a bringing up the
Reer! I remembers werry well when the other
City Picter was printed, about a year ago,
when the LORD MARE'S three Footmen, all in
their werry hansum-
est uniforms, was
Elaced exactly in the
ront, and all being
fine honsum fellers,
as they undowtedly
is, they were thort to
have taken the shine
out of the hole Picter,
but that was in
course quite a dif-
frent thing, and this
new one is to be quite
werry diffrent from
that one, and carried
out in quite another
style altogether, and
will, I shoud think,
atroct such uniwer-
sul admiration as will
quite cut out the Picter Gallery as was shown
at Gildall last summer.
Sum few of the werry hansumeet of the hole
Court as has bin and got taken already, has
bin and stuck theirselves np in the Reading
Room, and werry proud they is of their ap-
perience, and BROWN and Me has got sum of
the Atendentt) to let us go in before the
Members comes, and see em privately. BROWN
says as how as he's quite sure as there must
be sum mistake about me, becoz as he carn't
at all see how I shoud fit in with the rest.
But there's werry little dout in my mind that
it's all a cose of gelosy with BROWN, who
wond werry much like to have sitch a chance.
• » * • •
I had my chance of going yesterday, and
werry kind the Gennelman wos who took me,
and he took me three times, to make sure of
me. He said as I wag a werry good Setter,
and that everybody woud know who I was by
my likenesses in Punch, and lots of pet-pie
woud like to git my Picter, as it was a
werry good likeness. ROBKUT.

For infinitesimal gains;
Oh, butterfly, picture thee

Developing backwards to

It fills me with doldrums

To dandy-grey russet; dunducketty dun!
Oh, PAYN, this is painful. You must be in

You might as well just be a fly, ,
All fuzzy, and buzzy, and dusty,
A horror to ear and to eye.

Degraded to rain-beaten brown ;•

twitter:
Trv without noise the early worm to find.
Why should you seek my rest-time to em-

No doubt you think your maddening cheep
Sweeter than sons of nightingale or linnet,
But, tossing here with imprecations deep,
I do declare I find no sweetness in it.

SIR,—I have seen some letters in the Daily Graphic on the above
subject. A much more curious thing happened to me on April 1,1887,
at twenty-five minutes past ten in the morning. I dropped a pin
about fouryardsfrom the south-western comer of the Marble Arch.
It is almost incredible that exactly three years later I picked_ up a
pin. at 4.17 in the afternoon, three yards and Peven and aquarter inches
to the south-east of the Humane Society's Receiving House. 1 have
studied carefully the levels of the ground, the How of the surface
water, and the direction of the prevailing air currents, and I am
reluctantly forced to the conclusion that it was not the same pin.
Had it been, I should have found it five and a half inches further
north. The question now is, whose pin was it?—Your obedient
servant, SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATOR.
DEAR SIR,—Some weeks ago I rode outside an omnibus from
Piccadilly Circus to Charing- Cross. Getting down hastily, when I
found that it went on to Westminster instead of the City, I left
behind a large grey parrot in a cage, a siphon of soda-water, and a
St. Bernard dog. '"iestcrday, when I climbed on to on omnibus
following the same route, I found my cape, my siphon, and my dog!
It was the same omnibus, ami the faithful beast was Mill there.
Unfortunately the pnrrnt and the si da-water were not, for the
sagacious animal had evidently made use of them to sustain life,
not very satisfactorily, for he was a mere skeleton.
Yours obediently, CONSTANT RKAI>KR.

one latch-key in my pocket. Marvellous to relate, on my rettirn home

JAP THE GIANT-KILLER.
(fragment of a Tale of New Japan as told around a Fire-Brazier in
Dai Nippon.)
• ••***
ONCE upon a time in the Happy Dragon-fly shaped Land of the
Rising Son there lived a little hero named JAP. Small he was, but
valiant as TAKfe-NO-r/CHi-NO-suKUNf: himself of the long life and
mini v-sylliililcd name. He was a dead hand at dragon slaying, and
had killed more tigers than HAD for. He could exorcise Oni like one
o'clock, these demons or imps having an exceeding bad time of it
when JAP was, as he would term it, "on the job." In fact, his
exploits were the favourite topic of talk when young and old gathered
around the hibachi, or fire-braziers, to list to tales of heroism, filial
piety, and Pro-Oress. Pro-Oress was the name of the great new
goddess of whom JAP was a votary. From her he had received the
gift of a new "sword of sharpness," which would not only, like
the gift of the triple-headed Cornish giant, "cut through anything,"
but would make all enemies cut like anything.
Little JAP, having acquired this wonderful sword, compared with
which that which NITTA threw into the sea was a mere oyster-knife,
was naturally desirous of using it. He kept it as sharp as that of
the great demon-queller SHO-EI; but the demons he quelled with
it were the great obstructive ogres known as Kon-serva-tism,
Fogi-ism and Pre-ju-dice. JAP gave those antiquated bogies
beans. The Tengus and Sho-jos hod a bad time of it, you bet, and
the " bag " of Dragons, or Tatsns, JAP oould show after one of his
regular "battues" was a caution to Saurions, I can assure you!
He hod a collection of Tatsu-teeth that would have aroused the
envy of CADMUS, and given JASON a high-toned job. As to that
temble wild-fowl, the Ho-ho bird, with " the head of a pheasant,
the beak of a swallow, the neck of a tortoise, and the outward
semblance of a dragon," JAP, with his "gun of swiftness" (another
gift of his favourite goddess) knocked the Ho-hos over right and left, as
though they were really pheasants in a swell British preserve; and it
was commonly said that when JAP had a day among the Ho-hos, there
was a glut in the Toyoakitsu poultry market for a fortnight after.
But JAP, in time, grew tired of the common or cherry-garden Ho-ho.
and awearyof such ?mall sport as mere dragons and demons coula
furnish. He yearned like an Anglo-Indian Shikari for big game!
Now there was on ugly, but enormous giant, fierce-looking as
Rip Van Winkle, strong as Asaina Saburo, the Dai Nippon Her-
cules, big as Fusi-yama, "the matchless mountain," rich as the
Treasure Ship, laden with Ta-kara-moco (or "Precious Things"),
stubborn, stolid, and unprogressive as Kame, the hairy-tailed
tortoise, himself. This tremendous Tartar-Mongolian Blunderbore
had a number of fine names, of flowery flavour and Celestial
swaggerAomeness, but we will call him JON-NI, for short.
Now Little JAP hated Big JON-NI, and Big JON-NI disdained
Little JAP, as indeed he disdained everybody else save his conceited
and colossal self. JAP curled his lip at JON-NI; JON-NI put out his
tongue at JAP like a China figure; when the duodecimo hero bit his
thumb at the elephantine Celestial, the elephantine Celestial cocked a
snook at the duodecimo hero. This oould not last. Little JAP was
ambitious to try his sword of sharpness and his gun of swiftness
upon big game. He cried, " By the heroic Hidesato who slew the
giant Centipede, I will have a slap at this bouncing Sobadil of a
wooden-headed, grandmother-worshipping, old Stick-m-the-mud I"
Some of his more timid friends tried to dissuade him. "Beware,
JAP," they cried, "this Chinese Blunderbore is loo big for thee!"
"Pooh!" retorted the undaunted JAP. "Itemember
'the valiant Corniahman
Who slew the giant Cormoran.'
Am I not as big as JACK now, and as fit to play the Giant-killer
as he? Too big? Why, the overgrown monster is like the Buddhist
Daruma, who, 'arriving in China in the sixth century, at once went
into a state of abstraction, which extended over nine years, during
which time he never moved; and as a result lost the use of his legs?
Only JON-NI has been 'in a state of abstraction' for nine centuries
instead of nine years, and has lost the use of his head, as well as his
legs! He hates and scorns my tutelary goddess. Pro-Qress. I will
try the effect of her gifts upon him! Here goes '.'.'."

His admiring friends dubbed him "JAP the Giant-Killer" at
once. And, indeed, when he "went for" that clumsy Colossus,

of the first round, in which the swaggersome JON-NI was fairly
beaten to hi» knees, seemed to justify the title. But giants are not

BOWL me no more: the man may draw the stumps;
The rain may swoop from heaven and swamp the create;
In folds of haize the bat may lie at peace;
But oh, too fond of yorkers, breaks and bump*,
Bowl me no more!
Bowl me no more: 'tis dark at half-past five;
The misty light betrays the keenest eye.

And spoiled the wickets. Lo, I leave the field

A DAY'S RIDE, A LAWS ROMANCE.
(A Story of the Long Vacation.)
"MR. BRIEFLESS," said an eminent solicitor to me the other
day, "I want you to go to East Babbleton, in Quiltshire, to BC •
if the Great Gooseberry Will case is still open. It is a matter of
vital importance, and I shall be glad if you can attend to it
to-morrow."
Referring to POHTINOTON, I found that my diary was clear f T
the day specified, and I expressed my willingness to carry out my
client's instructions.
"I must know at once," continued the gentleman, "because 1
desire to bring the matter before the Vacation Judge on an origi-
nating summons. I need scarcely add, that you will get the fullest
particulars from the parish clerk.
Although rather imperfectly instructed, I determined to visit East
Babbleton. The usual sources of railway information led me to
believe that the place was six or seven miles distant from Nearvioes
in Guiltshire. I determined to go to Nearvieei, takiog with me my two
lads (homefor the holidays), GEORGE LEWISHERSCHELL and EDWARD
CLARKE RUSSELL. Before now I have explained that my sons'
Christian names have been selected with a view to assisting (in after
years) their professional advancement. We had to start at an
unusually early hour from London, and after enjoying the com-
panionship of some sportsmen, who talked about "duck" and
roots" for a quarter of a day, arrived at Nearvices at eleven
o'clock. I made at once for the Ked Lion, the principal hotel
in the town. My sons followed me, eager for breakfast. Until then,
they had satisfied their appetite by the stealthy consumption of
about half-a-pound of a sweetmeat that is, I believe, known as
Japanese Almond Rock.
The " Rtd Lion " was in a state of great commotion. There were
people in high hats at the door, people in high hats looking out ot
the coffee-room window, people in high, hats thronging the hall. With
some trouble my lads and I got our breakfast, then I asked for the
ostler. He cime to me after a pause and awaited my orders.
"I want a trap to take me over to East Babbleton," I said; "and
should like to know how much it will cost."
"Very sorry. Sir. but I can't do it for you. All the carriages in
the house are hired. You know, Sir, Miss SMITH is going to be
married, and consequently you can't get a conveyance for love or
money."
I was seriously annoyed, as the instructions of my client were
explicit.
I really must get over," I said emphatically; "surely Miss
Surra can lend us one of her carriages. You might ask her future
husband."
"Can't do that. Sir," replied the ostler; "for we none of us know
him. However, I '11 see what can be done for you. Could you drive
yourself over P"
"Oh, d> Papa," shouted my two sons in an ecstaoy of delight.
"It would be such fun! and mother isn't here to stop you."
"Well, I will have a shot at it," I returned; "although truth to
tell I am a little ru'ty. I have not driven for some time.'
The ostler eyed me rather sharply, and retired. I then thought it
my duty to reprove my suns for their ill-timed levity, explaining that
their tomfoolery might have caused the ostler to refuse to entrust his
equipage to my care.
"But you have never driven in your life P" said GEOEOB LEWIS
HERSCHELL. "Have you, Papa?"
"I cannot say that I have," I replied, with that truthfulness

The Colonel. "Birr DID IT NEVER OCCUR TO YOU THAT IF in:
SUCH A CONFOUNDED IDIOT HE WOULD NEVER HAVE BSKN
YOUE SERVANT?"
"Oh, what a game!" shiuted EDWAKD CLABKE RUSSELL, roaring
with laughter.
Severely chiding my offspring, I proceeded to the hall d «or. The
ostler had been as good asnis word. There was ec-rtuinly a
conveyance.
"It is not very showy, Sir," sail the proprietor; " but I think it
will lost a dozen of miles or so."
It was a small dog-cart, which conjured up visions of the toy
waggon-and-horse department in the Lowther Arcade. There was a
horse in the shafts. The harness was imperfect, and the collar
showed its straw. However. I took my seat, and the boys got up
beside me. Then, amidst the good wishes of the wedding party
watching our progress, I started. The horse immediately took up a
course over the pavement, and no doubt aware that the illumi-
nating power at East Babbleton was primitive, attempted to
carry with him a lamp-post. We cannoned off the pavement into
the middle of the road, and were fairly "off."
"If you biys laugh any more," I said, wi h the utmost severity,
"I will turn you out and leave you."
"But Papa, if mother could only see us!" oritd the pair, and
then they indulged in apparently unextinguishab'c bursts of
merriment.
I had no further time for remonstrance, as ths brute of a horse,
after beginning in a trot, had suddenly quickened its pace to a mad
gallop. And as it did this I noticed that a dust-cart was just in
front of us. I dragged at the reins, and with almost superhuman
exertions brought the beast to n full stop.
"Which is the way to East Babbleton?" I asked, to explain my
rather abrupt pull-up. "Am I taking the right road?"
The dustman looked at me, at the horse, smiled, and answered in
the affirmative. Seeing that we were now about to descend a hill, I

attention. So far as I ould judge, without being an expert in
horse-flesh, it seemed to me to be suffering from tooth-ache. It shook
its head when I touched it, and appeared to be disinclined to go
further.
"Do get in. Papa," paid EDWARD CLARKE RUSSELL. "Perhaps he
will go all right if you leave him alone."
Adopting my son's advice, I mounted the cart, and once again
jerked the reins. The beast began at a trot, and then, as before,
commenced a mad gallop. We rapidly left Nearvices behind us, and
brought ourselves to a stop in front of a haystack.
"You see," I said, "the brute is open to reason. It was stopped
by an obstruction. Seeing the futility of further progress, it
desisted in its running."
"But look. Papa, at that," cried GEORGE LEWIS HRRSCHELL,
pointing to what seemed to be the remains of a coal cart. The wheels
were off, 1 he black diamonds were scattered about in all directions,
and the shafts were broken.
"Was that an accident f" I asked an old man who was lighting
his pipe. The venerable individual paused, looked at the pipe,
looked at the pieces of the cart, and looked at me. Then he rubbed
the right side of his head with the palm of his right hand.
"Well, yes, it was," he admitted, in an accent I cannot reproduce;
but added, in a tone that suggested lhat mishaps of a similar charac-
ter occurred on the average every five minutes; "but that accident
happened near an hour ago."
This intelligence rather damped my ardour, and I immediately got
off the cart and insisted upon leading the brute down the next hill.
The animal protested, and shook its head. Remembering its
possible tooth-ache, I treated it with increased courtesy, telling it
to "Gee-up" and " be a good horse." I am sorry to say that the
creature did not seem inclined (o acknowledge my kindness.
the Lowther Arcade dog-cart, and urged on my partially wild
career. I had passed a four-winged post at cross roads, and had
followed the sign pointing to " Babbleton." I had (jot safely up to
a farm-house, having restrained en route an inclination on the part
of my horse to commit suicide by jumping over the parapet of a
bridge into a small mountain torrent.
"Is this the way to East Babbleton?" I asked a rather cheery,
rosy-cheeked dame, who had been watching our mano3uvres with
a kindly smile, not entirely exempt from good-natured appre-
hension.
"No, this is not the road, Master," she returned, in the same
unapproachable dialect. "You ought to have borne to the left when
you came to the cross-roads."
Seeing that I had to go back, I seized each of the reins and called
upon my beast of a horse to make an effort. The noble animal
answered bravely to the call, and managed to turn round on a space of
turf about the size of a waggon wheel. It was really a very clever
performance, and had it been seen by Mr. RITCHIE, I fancy would
nave secured for us a lucrative engagement for a " side show" at the
Royal Westminster Aquarium.
Well, that was a shave surely," said the dame of the cheery
countenance: "when I saw your off wheel go up in the air and hang
over the ditch I thought it would be all up with ye."
Accepting the compliment with dignihed geniality, I asked our
fair critic it she coula bait our horse.
"Well, I can g^ive him a handful of hay," said the lady; "but I
would not take him out of the shafts for worlds. If I untied him I
could not put him together again."
Refreshed by the nourishment, our steed started again, and after
retracing our steps and nearly upsetting a hay cart, and narrowly
running down a pig, we reached East Babbleton in fairly good condition.
I looked at my watch and found that we had done the six miles in
two hours and a quarter. Having transacted my business, I now
turned the nose of my steed homewards. I had noticed with some
alarm that I had only an hour to get back to Nearvices if I wanted to
catch the train for London. This being so, I saw it was absolutely
necessary that I should act with decision. 1 held a council of war
with my two sons, and we came to the conclusion that we must get
hack as fast at we could, and when there was a difficulty, risk it. We
entered our conveyance and started.
I shall never forget the experience. It was absolutely delightful.
Giving Flora (I came to the conclusion that my steed with the tooth-
ache must have been called Flora) her head, I urged her to progress
as rapidly an possible. The mare promptly answered to the call. I
paid chick," and she started off at a maa gallop. We absolutely
flew up-hill, down-hill, and would no doubt have entered "my lady's
chamber" had not the adjoining cottages been occupied by rustics.
At our approach children, ducks, dogs and gipsies fled in terror. We
boldly cannoned against waggons and shook milestones to their very
foundations. I had long since forgotten my nervousness, and had
aimmed an air that would have been becoming in an individual
nicknamed (let us say) "down the road Billy."
I urged Flora to " gee up," by suggesting that "five o'clock tea"
was waiting for her on her arrival at Nearvices. My two sons,
GEORGE LEWIS HERSCHELL and EDWARD CLARKE RUSSELL, also
rendered valuable assistance by waving their straw hats, and singing
cpmic_ songs with a vehemence that rendered the ballads undis-
tinguishable from war ditties. As we entered Nearvices, Flora
stumbled, and all but fell. However, with wonderful skill, I picked
her up at the end of my reins, and urged her to fresh exertions by a
leeble flick of the whip, that expended its force on the shafts ana a
part of the collar. Again we flew on. We renewed our acquaint-
ance with the attractive lamp-post, we crossed the sharp curve of the
familiar pavement, we collided against the monument to a worthy in
the market-place, and drove up with a jtrk in front of the "Red
Lion." I looked again at my watch; we had done the six miles in
twenty-two minutes. Considering the hills, dales, and obstiuctive
milestones, a very fair record.
"What, you have come back!" exclaimed the landlady of the" Red
Li>m." "Why, we never expected to see you."
I found subsequently that the wedding party, after watching our
departure, had taken bets about our probable return. The most
popular wager seemed to be that we should reappear after midnight
with a wheel, a bit of harness, and the whip, but without the
quadruped.
I have nothing further to relate save this. That after my recent
success I am thinking seriously of giving up the Bar and taking to
the road. If I can raise the required capital, I think I shall run a
four-horse coach between the Temple and Turnham Green. Both
my boys are anxious to give up their school to act as my guard.
By the way. I may add in conclusion that the parish clerk of East
Babbleton declared that he had never heard (until I mentioned i

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LORD ROSEBERY IN THE
NORTH.
THE PRIME MINISTF.R has
been haying a high old time
of it lately in the North, and
has become the "youngest
burgess" of goodness knows
how many ancient boroughs.
But it has been left to a
reporter to note with an eagle
eye the really interesting per-
formance which Lord ROSE-
IIKHV has put to his credit.
"Immediately on leaving
Dornoch," says this gentle-
man (the reporter, not the
PBKMIEB), "Lord ROSEBEBY
and the Duke of SUTHEBLAND
drove to the Meikle Ferry, a
distance of four miles, crossed
the ferry, and again drove to
Tain, four miles farther on.
Crossing the ferry they both
took a turn at the oars, and
generally discussed the sport
of seal shooting!" This sug-
gests quite a fresh phase of the
New Journalism. We shall
soon read such paragraphs as
the following :—
"Sir WILLIAM HABComT
left town for Malwood on
Tuesday. Going down in the
train the right hon. gentle-
man played marbles with a
fellow - passenger, and dis-
cussed generally the virtues
of resignation."

SWEET SIMPLICITY.
Diffident Man (who does not know to how much of an Ingenue he is talking).
"HAVE YOU BBEN OUT LONG, MlSS GRACE?"
Miss Grate (consulting her wrist-strap), "On, ABOUT THREE-QUARTZES OF
AN HOUR. YOU SEE WE WERE ASKED TO COME PUNCTUALLY."
"Mr. H. H. FOWLEB tran-
sacted important business at
the India Office yesterday.
He and his private secretary
played a game of trundling
hoops, and had an animated
talk on the subject of whist."
"Mr. A. J. BALFOUB played
at golf with a gentleman, with
whom he had a very interest-
ing conversation on the sport
of chute shooting."
The moral of which would
seem to be that, since even

the Record to remember its

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
"AHA!" quoth the Baron. "This book of Master STANLEY
WEYMAN'S, called Under the Red^ Robe, delighteth me much. A
stirring story of swashbucklers, pistols, daggers, conspirators, (ray
gallants, and gentle dames! Exciting
from first to last, and all in one volume,
which, beshrew me, by my hilts!"
quoth the Baron. "the reader, be he
who he may, will find easy to take up,
and most difficult to pat down, until
quite finished. 'Tis published by one
METHUEN, of London, whose house
Cavalier WEYMAN hath favoured more
than once ere he wrote this stirring
romance." Towards the finish there is
a spice of BULWEH LYTTON'S drama
Richelieu, — indeed the last situation
in this tale is almost one with the
action of the scene in the play where
Richelieu brings the lovers together.
Yet is this but a mere detail, and those
who follow the Baron's literary tips will
do well and wisely to read Under the Red
Robe. By the way, Mr. CATON WOODVILLE'S illustrations to the story
are excellent, having the rare merit of assisting the action without
revealing the plot. "CATON, thou pictureth well."
Within the limits of a hundred* pages Lord DUFFERIN has given
the world a picture it will not willingly let die. It is a portrait of
his mother, one of the sweetest, most beautiful, most accomplished,
wittiest, most loving and lovable human beings that ever walki-d
upon the earth." This, as my Baronite says, is the superlative of
praise, and it might reasonably be suspected that filial feeling has
warped critical acumen. But nere in this volume of Songs, Poems,
ana Verses (JOHN MURRAY) we have Lady DUFFERIN though dead
yet speaking, and may judge for ourselves. It is characteristic of
her son that, whilst on the first page the above title is boldly set
forth-in large ruddy-hued type, a smaller line lower down, in
plain black ink, refers to the Memoir." In its felicity of literary
style, its clear touches of characterisation, and its flashes of quiet
humour, this monograph is a masterpiece. It fittingly frames
the extract from the journal commenced by Lady DUFFERIN when
she felt the hand of death gripping her. This fragment is prose
worthy of tie author of The Insh Emigrant, whose simple pathos
has stirred the heart on both sides of the Atlantic. Within the
brief limits he has assigned to himself, Lord DUFFBRIN manages
to give a succinct account of the illustrious family of which HELEN,
Lady DUFFERIN, was a bright, particular star. It would be difficult
to parallel the sustained brilliancy of the SHERIDANS, from KICHABD
BRINSLEY down to his great-great-grandson, at present Her
MAJESTY'S Minister at Paris. To the possession of all the graces
they have added display of all the talents. It is hard to live up to
the literary standard of the SHERTDANS. In this delightful volume
Lord DUFFERIN shows that the marvel was accomplished by his
mother, and is possible for himself.
My Baronite has made an attempt to read Lourdes in the con-
venient shape in which Messrs. CHATTO AND WINDUS present it to
the English-speaking public. He honestly admits tbat, finding
on a rapid glance through its pages the first chapter was a fair
sample of the bulk, he gave it up. M. ZOLA has avowedly set him-
self the task of minutely describing the pitiful experience of the halt,
the lame, the blind, and much worse, wno journey to Lourdes in the
desperate hope of miraculous recovery. He may at leatt be con-
gratulated on having achieved his object. Only, the report with all
its horrible detail would more fittingly have appeared in the pages of
the Lancet or the British Medical Journal. Since it has been pub-
lished in book form realism should have been carried one step
further. The volume ought to have been bound in a poultice instead
of ordinary cloth. As it is, the leaves turned over fill the room with
faint, sickening smell of the hospital ward. Lourdes is certainly not
alluring. It is, in truth, lourd—et sale aussi.
Once again, for the benefit of all brother-scribes who, for a while,
or frequently, may have to do their scribbling when journeying, or
while compelled by illness to remain in Bedford-under-Clothes,—as
was but recently the case with your own Baronius, pains and
counterpanes all over him,—the use of " The Hairless Author's
Paper-pad," i.e. " The Author's Hairless Paper-pad," issued by
the Leadenhall Press, on which the author can write with pencil or
with pen,—for the blotter is handily placed at the back of the pad,
—is strongly recommended by the Ready Writer's and Ready

looking inside the hoof.
Check.'In course he
don't, or he 'd ha' looked
the' very fust thing,
with all his experience.
I 'ope you're satisfied
now, ADAMS?
Adams. I can't say
as I am. 1 say as no
man can .examine a
'orse thoroughly at that
distance, be he who he
mav. And whether I 'm
right or wrong, it 'ud
be more of a fati'faction
to me if Mr. UNDER-
SH ELL was to step in and
see the 'oof for himself.
Check. Well, there's
sense in that, and I
dessayMr. UKDERSHELL
won't object to obliging
you that far.
Und. (tcith reluct-
ance). Oh, with plea-
sure, if you make a
point of it.
[He enters the loose box delicately.
Adams (picking up one of the horse's feet). Now, tell me how
this 'ere 'oof strikes you.
Und. (to himself). That hoof can't; but I'm not so Hire about
the others. (Aloud, as he inspects it.) Well—er—it seems to me a
very nice hoof.
Adam* (grimly). I was not arsking your opinion of it as a work of
Art, Sir. Do you see any' narrering coming on, or do you not?
That's what I should like to get out of you!
Und. (to himself). Does this man suppose I collect hoofs! How-
ever, I 'm not going to commit myself. -(Aloud,) H'm—well, -I—
I rather agree with Mr. CHECKLKT.
Check. I knew he would! Now you 've got it, ADAMS! / can
see Mr. UNDEHSHELL knows what he's about.
You can't

Adams (aggrieved). You may think proper to treat it light, Sir;

Und. Very likely. But I don't know, really, that it would afford
me any particular gratification if I did-!
Adams. Well, if you don't take my view, I should ha' thought as
you 'd want to feel the 'orse's pulse.
Und. You are quite mistaken. I don't. (To himself.) Particu-
larly as I shouldn t know where to find it. What a bore this fellow
is with his horse!
Check. In course, Sir, you see what's running in Mr. ADAMS' 'ed
all this time, what he's a-driving at, eh?
Und. (to himself). I only wish I did I This will require tact.
(Aloud.) I—I could hardly avoid seeing that—could I?
Check. I should think not. And it stands to reason as a vet like
yourself 'd spot a thing like navickler fust go off.
Und. (to himself). A vet! They 've been taking me for a vet all
this time! 1 can't have been so ignorant as I thought. I really
don't like to undeceive them—they might feel annoyed. (Aloud,
knowingly.) To be sure, I—I spotted it at once.
Adarm, He dues make it out navicular after all 1 What did I tell
you, CHECKLEY? Now p'r'aps yon '11 believe me!
Check. I '11 be shot if that 'orse has navickler, whoever says so—
there!
Adams (gloomily). It's the orse '11 'ave to be shot; worse luck!
I 'd ha' give something if Mr. UNDERSHELL could ha' shown I was
wrong: but there was very little doubt in my mind what it was all
along.
Und. (to himself, horrified). I 've been pronouncing this unhappy
animal's doom without knowing it! I must tone it down. (Aloud.)
No—no, I never said he must be shot. There's no reason to d_espair.
It—it's quite a mild form of er—clavicular—not at all infectious at
present. And the horse has a splendid constitution. I—I really
think he '11 soon be himself again, if we only—er—leave Nature to do
her work, you know.
Adams (after a prolonged whistle). Well, if Nature ain't better
up in her work than you seem to be, it's 'igh time she chucked it,
and took to something else. You 've a lot to learn about navicular,
you 'ave, if you can talk such rot as that!
Check. Ah, I 've 'ad to do with a vet or two in my time, but I 'm
blest if I ever come across the likes o" you afore!
Und. (In himself). I knew thev'd find me out! I must pacify
Ihem. (Aloud.) But, look here, I 'm not a vet. I never said I u-as.
It was your mistake entirely. The fact is, my—my good men, I
came down here because—well, it's unnecessary to explain now ichy
I came. But I 'm most anxious to get away, and if you, my dear Mr.
CiiErKLEY, could let me have a trap to take me to Shuntingbridge
to-night, I should feel extremely obliged.
[CHECKLEY stares, deprived of speech.
Adams (with a private wink to CHECKLEY). Certainly he will,
Sir. I'm sure CHECKLEY '11 feel proud to turn out, late as it is,
to oblige a gentleman with your remarkable knowledge of 'orse-
nesh. Drive you over hisself in the broom and pair, / shouldn't
wonder!
Und. One horse will be quite sufficient. Very well, then. I'11 just
run up and get my portmanteau, and—and one or two things of mine,
and if you will be round at the back entrance—don't trouble to drive
up to the front door—as soon as possible, I won't keep you waiting
longer than I can help. Oood evening, Mr. ADAMS, and many
thanks. (To himself, as he hurries back to the house.) I've got
out of that rather well. Now, I've only to find my way to the
Verney Chamber, see this fellow SPUBRELL, and get my clothes
back, and then I can retreat with comfort, and even dignity! These
CULVEKINS •shall learn that there is at least one poet who will not put
up with their insolent patronage!
Check, (to ADAMS). He has got a cool cheek, and no mistake!
But if he waits to be druv over to Shuntingbridge till / come round
for him, he '11 'ave to set on that portmanteau of his a goodish
time!
Adams. He did you pretty brown, I must say. To 'ear you crow-
ing over me when he was on your side. I could 'ardly keep from
lirting!
Check. I see he warn't no vet long afore you, but I let it go on for
tie joke of it. It was rich to see you a wanting him to feel the 'oof,
aid give it out navickler. Well, you got his opinion for what it was
with, so you 're all right!
Adams. You think nobody knows anything about 'orses but your-
self, you do; but if you 're meanin' to make a story out o' this
agajist me, why, I shall tell it my way, that's all!
Check. It was you he made a fool of, not me—and I can prove it
—thtre!
[They dispute the point, with rising warmth, for some time.
Adinis (calming down). Well, see 'ere, CHECKLEY, I dunno, come
to thiik of it, as either on us '11 show up partickler smart over this
'ere j(b; and it strikes me we'd better both agree to keep quiet
about i1., eh? (CHECKLEY acquiesces, nut unwillingly.) And I think

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
"AHA!" quoth the Baron. "This book of Master STANLEY
WEYMAN'S, called Under the Red_ Robe, delighteth me much. A
stirring story of swashbucklers, pistols, daggers, conspirators, gay
gallants, and gentle dames! Exciting
from first to last, and all in one volume,
which, beshrew me, by my hilts!"
quoth the Baron, "the reader, be he
who he may, will find easy to take up,
and most difficult to put down, until
quite finished. 'Tis published bv one
METHTTEN, of London, whose house
Cavalier WEYMAN hath favoured more
than once ere he wrote this stirring
romance." Towards the finish there is
a spice of BULWER LYTTON'S drama
Richelieu, — indeed the last situation
in this tale is almost one with the
action of the scene in the play where
Richelieu brings the lovers together.
Yet is this but a mere detail, ana those
who follow the Baron's literary tips will
do well and wisely to read Under the Red
Robe. By the way, Mr. CATON WOODVILLE'S illustrations to the story
are excellent, having the rare merit of assisting the action without
revealing the plot. "CATON, thou pictureth well."
Within the limits of a hundredf pages Lord DUFFERIN has given
the world a picture it will not willingly let die. It is a portrait of
his mother, one of the sweetest, most beautiful, most accomplished,
wittiest, most loving and lovable human beings that ever walked
upon the earth." This, as my Baronite says, is the superlative of
praise, and it might reasonably be suspected that filial feeling has
warped critical acumen. But nere in this volume of Songs, Poems,
ana Verses (Jonir MURRAY) we have Lady DUFKERIN though dead
yet speaking, and may judge for ourselves. It is characteristic of
her son that, whilst on the first page the above title is boldly set
forth in large ruddy-hued type, a smaller line lower down, in
plain black ink, refers to the Memoir." In its felicitv of literary
style, its clear touches of characterisation, and its flashes of quiet
humour, this monograph is a masterpiece. It fittingly frames
the extract from the journal commenced by Lady DUFFERIN when
she felt the hand of death gripping her. This fragment is prose
worthy of the author of The Irish Emigrant, whose simple pathos
has stirred the heart on both sides of the Atlantic. Within the
brief limits he has assigned to himself, Lord DUFFERIN manages
to give a succinct account of the illustrious family of which HELEN,
Lady DUFFERIN, was a bright, particular star. It would be difficult
to parallel the sustained brilliancy of the SHERIDANS, from RICHARD
BRINSLEY down to his great-great-grandson, at present Her
MAJESTY'S Minister at Paris. To the possession of all the graces
they have added display of all the talents. It is hard to live up to
the literary standard of the SHERIDANS. In this delightful volume
Lord DUFFERIN shows that the marvel was accomplished by his
mother, and is possible for himself.
My Baronite has made an attempt to read Lourdes in the con-
vcnienl shape in which Messrs. CHATTO AND WINDUS present it to
the English-speaking public. He honestly admits that, finding
on a rapid glance through its pages the first chapter was a fair
sample of the bulk, he gave it up. M. /OLA has avowedly set him-
self the task of minutely describing the pitiful experience of the halt,
the lame, the blind, and much worse, who journey to Lourdes in the
desperate hope of miraculous recovery. He may at leait be con-
gratulated on having achieved his object. Only, the report with all
its horrible detail would more fittingly have appeared in the pages of
the Lancet or the British Medical Journal. Since it has been pub-
lished in book form realism should have been carried one step
further. The volume ought to have been bound in a poultice instead
of ordinary cloth. As it is, the leaves turned over fill the room with
faint, sickening smell of the hospital ward. Lourdes is certainly not
alluring. It is, in truth, lourd—et sale aussi.
Once again, for the benefit of all brother-scribes who, for a while,
or frequently, may have to do their scribbling when journeying, or
while compelled by illness to remain in Bedford-under-Clothe?,—as

the Leadenhall Press, on which the author can write with pencil or
with pen,—for the blotter is handily placed at the back of the pad,
—is strongly recommended by the Ready Writer's and Ready
Reader's best friend,
THE IILAMELES8 BAUON I)E BoOC-WOBH*.
MEM. HY AN OLD MAID.—If you "look over your age," you
chap, foi it's my belief he ain't down 'ere for no good!
won't find anyone else willing to do the same.

(and a Herriekoie rein).
WHENAS to shoot my JULIA goes,
Then, then, (methinks) how bravely
• shows
That rare arrangement of her clothes!
So shod as when the Huntress Maid
With thumping buskin bruised the
glade,
She moveth, making earth afraid.
Against the sting of random chaff
Her lealhern gaiters circle half
The arduous crescent of her calf.
Unto th" occasion timely tit.
My love's attire doth show her wit,
And of her legs a little hit.
Sorely it sticketh in my throat,
She having nowhere to bestow't,
To name the absent petticoat.
In lieu whereof a wanton pair
Of knickerbockers she doth wear,
Full windy and with space to spare.
Knlarged by the bellying breeze,
Ix>rd! how they playfully do ease
The urgent knocking of her knees!
Lengthways curtailed to her taste
A tunic circumvents her waist,
And sootbly it is passing chaste.
Upon her head she hath a gear
Even such as wights of ruddy cheer
Do use in stalking of the deer.
Haply her truant tresses mock
Some coronal of shapelier block,
To wit, the bounding billy-cock.
Withal she hath a loaded gun,
Whereat -the pheasants, aa they run,
Do make a fair diversion.
For very awe, if so she shoots,
My hair upriseth from the roots,
And lo! I tremble in my boots!

["Since the defeat of the Home Rule Bill they (the Irish Party) have all been engaged in blackening each other's characters, and painting each other's portraits; and I venture to say that the result
of that is not a gallery of pictures, but a Chamber of Horrors."]

THE COMPLAINT OF THE
MODERN LOVER.
MY peerless but progressive Fair,
To you my heart I proffer.
Time was when one knew where
you were,
And how to make an offer.
Now, all too swiftly you advance
For Damon to pursue you.
Take pity on his ignorance,
And tell him ftoic to woo you!
If strong on Woman's Rights you
are,
Upon her wrongs 1 '11 ponder:
I '11 win for you a Wanderjahr,
If I with you may wander.
Or does Humanity enthrall?
Before the summer passes
I '11 run a moral Music Hall
To renovate the Masses. ,
Say, shall I write to you in verse
Of metre strange and frantic,
Which by neglect of barriers
Proves genius gigantic?
Is modern notion dear to you?
In scandal while I grovel,
I will endeavour to outdo
Its most pernicious novel!
Beloved, of tchich patent creed
Shall I uplift the banner?
By telepathy shall I plead.
Or in the usual manner f
If after Occult Truth you grope.
Though now 1 'm no Mahatma,
From earthly bonds I yet might
hope—
For you—to free my Atma!
Shall I by Oeomancy show
Your lot and mine united,
The sign of Acqnisitio
Foretelling love requited?
Or shall I from the planets prove
That long before I knew you
Our fates were linked? My
modern love,
Oh, tell me hoic to woo you!

REFLECTIONS
(By a Well-Plucked One.}
WEEN chapel bells rang far and
wide,
Why did I turn upon my side,
Andsweetly back to slumber glide?
I wonder I
When zephyrs wafted on their way
The fragrance of the new-mown
hay,
Why did I cut m
lectures, eh?
I wonder!
Why did I moor my punt afar,
With claret-cup and choice cigar,
Instead of reading for the Bar?
I wonder!
Why did the Proctors always
frown
On meeting me without a gown,
And ultimately send me down?
I wonder!
Why did the Dons all disagree
With my pet views on equity,
And plough me for my LL.B.?
I wonder!
Why am I now in chambers bare,
With nothing much but debts to
spare,
Cash gone,and credit growing rare?
I wonder!
Why dp no clients seek my door
To profit by my legal lore?
Will it be thus for evermore?
I wonder!
The New Fashion.
THE fashion in hair
The ladies now wear
Never can last I '11 engage:
For though, pretty deari",
It hideth their ears,
It addeth some years to their age
THE NEW MAN.
(A Fragment from the Romance of the Near Future.)
HE had waited up until two in the morning. He had watched the
hands of the clock as they passed round the face from hour to hour.
He had put a cloth over the supper, knowing, however, that the
meat would be disregarded, and only the brandy and soda-water
touched by the expected one. The poor man gazed sadly at the
children's toys, the tradesmen's books that were beside him.
"Not home yet," he murmured. "Ah, those dinners at the club!"
Then he considered his past life. He remembered his wedding-
day, when it seemed so bright and fair. He was a happy husband,
with every prospect of a long life of wedded bliss. He loved and
respected his wife, and felt that side by side they could travel along
the road of existence without a rock to arrest their progress, without
a discordant note to spoil the harmony of their song, until that song
had ceased its music m the hush of silence. Tears, suppressed until
now, flooded his eyes as he remembered the waning of the honey-
moon. He recollected the anxiety of ALICE to get back to town, to
be o_ff into the City. Of course he could not follow his wife into her
business haunts; it would be immodest—nay, even improper. Still,
he had been treated kindly, in a rough, condescending sort of way.
He had hod a Brougham, and had been allowed to visit his gentle-
men friends. He had plenty of chats, and occasionally ALICE had
accompanied him round the park. Then he had seen a good deal
of his children. His daughter, however, had now gone to school, and
his sons were always with their nursery tutor. The clock struck
once again. "Three, and not home yet!"
Early morning was breaking. The poor man, pale and careworn,
re-arranged his necktie, and putting on an extra overcoat, prepared
once more to resume the reading of a novel that had been attracting
his attention earlier in the evening. It was called "Bobby," and
related the adventures of a wild, thoughtless man, who was setting
the laws of society at open defiance.
"How can men write of men like this?" he murmured. "I am
selves. Visiting a music-hall with his female cousin! Going to
the Zoological Gardens unattended! Oh, BOBBY, BOBBY, what a
creation!" Then he started. There was a noise at the street-door,
and the sound of scraping on the outside as if a latch-key were vainly
seeking the key-hole. Then the portal slowly opened and a cloaked
figure lurched rather than walked in.
"Oh ALICE!" cried the frightened husband, wringing his hands
in dismay. "Is there anything the matter?"
"Nothing, absolutely nothing," was the indistinct reply. "Fact is
I don't think the salmon"
And then the new-comer entered the dining-room, and there was
the sound of the effervescence of soda-water.
The poor husband sighed, mournfully turned off the gas, and went
quietly to bed.
"Oh wife," murmured the aggrieved husband, as he mounted the
stairs, "you cannot help bringing woe to man, for unless you did
so you would not be a woe-man."
And bursting into tears at this sad pleasantry, the poor chap
disappeared into the darkness.
COINCIDENCE'S LONG ARM.
DBAS SIH,—May I draw your attention to a series of domestic
occurrences which illustrate the distressing and increasing tendency
of this_/;«-</(.•-K/rWtf age? I say fin-de-siecle because as it has got to
come in somehow, it may as well be said at once. At breakfast yes-
terday the bacon was wretchedly cooked. My wife said, "It's the
fault of the New Cook," which was all the satisfaction or explanation
that I got. I found my study disguised in an apparent tidiness,
achieved at the cost of a complete confusion of my papers, which had
been tidied away in a manner that completely defied detection. My
wife only answered, "Oh.it 's that New Housemaid." That night
we went to the theatre. The name of the play was The Ifeic Woman.
Then I understood the true inwardness of all my previous experi-
ences. The moral is so clear that I do not propose to draw any.
not surprised that women think badly of us when we thus paint our-
NOTTA NEWMAN.

LETTERS FROM A DEBUTANTE.
DEAREST MABJOBIE,—It is really quite time vou gave me some
more of your valuable advice. Thanks tj you, 1 was not such an
utter failure in my first season as I expected. After a month at
home (my people loathe the new way I do my hair, and it seemed, I
am ashamed to say, a little dull there), I have come to stay again
with the LTON TAYMERS at their country house.
; You remember I refused the man who
did conjuring tricks? He has written to
me since to say he sees now how right I
was—rather crushing! I also fully in-
tended to refuse Captain MASHINGTON.
But he went to Dinard without giving me
the opportunity, and I hear he has been
playing tennis there the whole dav with
Mrs. LORNE HOPPER. I am sure I hope
he enjoyed it. She is what you or I would
consider rather old, but is said to be per-
fectly charming, and of course looks
fifteen years younger than her youngest
daughter.
It seems rather strange, doesn't it,
MABJOBIE, thataf ter being so wonderfully
sensible all the season, I should suddenly
do something quite idiotic in September?
However. I hare ; and I want you to help
me out of it. I '11 tell you all, if you 'ft
promise not to laugh. When I first came, I was '' thrown," as people
say, a good deal with the TAYMEE'S nephew—ORIEL CHAMPION who
has just left Oxford. I was told he was very serious, rather shy,
philanthropic, and has " views"; also that he had done a great deal
of good in the West End. This interested me, and I tried to draw
him out. They had omitted to mention that he was dreadfully sus-
ceptible. We talked for hours in the garden, nearly all the time—
at first—about the housing of the rich and horrible cases of over-
crowding—at London parties. He was very earnest and ascetic (he
never drinks anything but hot water, and doesn't smoke); he lent me
books—he is rather handsome—and—gradually—somehow I found I
had drifted into an absurd port of private halt-engagement! -Yes—
I have actually a bangle riretted on—with a date inside—the date I
was insane enough to agree Isn't it dreadful?
ORIEL will be well off, but ho intends to spend all his money on
founding model slums, where the people are to be teetotallers and do
bootmaking or something, and be a happy little colony. ORIEL'S
views may necessitate his doing a little cobbling himself—just to set
an example. I was enormously impressed by this at first; but I am
afraid I have become frivolous again. Some other people have come
here, including a nice boy they call BABY; BEAUMONT. He is
really almost nineteen, but wonderfully well preserved, very clever,
and S3 cynical that he is quite an optimist. Almost directly, he
asked me how long I had known ORIEL CRAM pros. I said about a
fortnight. "Ah! then you must be engaged to him. Poor old
ORIEL! He's really quite extraordinarily old-fashioned."
"How old is he?" I asked, in faltering tones.
"He has rather a way of pretending to be young, I fancy. But he
must be four-and-twenty if he is a day. You need not say I told you.''
It's evidently the fashion to be rery young—for men, at least.
Sometimes I wish it were the fashion to be old enough to know
better. If ORIEL really has been engaged before, and may be again,
and if getting engaged to people is only a sort of habit of his, perhaps
he would not mind so very much if I were to break it off.
BABY BEAUMONT is (he says himself) '• frankly Pagan." He
thinks ORIEL too serious for me, and advises me to marry at leisure,
as I am quite sure, anyhow, to repent in haste. He wanted to send
a paragraph to the Post to say "A marriage has been arranged, and
will shortly be broken off, between Mr. OKTEL CRAMPTON and Miss
GLADYS MIAYFIELD, younger daughter," and so on.
Last night, when we were playing games, ORIEL went out while we
thought of a word, and he got quite angry with me because I had said
the moon was " vegetab'e" and he said it was "mineral." He may
be right, or he may not—I daresay he is—but still he need not be
touchy, and refuse to play any more, and sulk all the evening.
I am afraid I should not be happy with him. He collects postage
stamps, too, which depresses me dreadfully.
Pleats write and tell me what to do—or rather, how to do it. Can
one get a bangle rirettedofff . . . I have just heard that the LORNE
HOPPKBS and Captain MASHINGTON are coming to play tennis on
Sunday! Of course, I shall show absolute indifference. I wired at
once to town for my new dress. Mrs. HOPPEB may as well see it.
BABY BEAUMONT is always changing his clothes, and has two
button-holes sent down from London daily. He says he "intends to
revive the gardenia." . . . ORIEL has just gone out for a ''brisk
walk before dinner." Aren't we utterly unsuitcd to each other?
Your loving friend, GLADYS.

THE GENERAL LITERARY REVIEW COMPANY, LIMITED.
CAPITAL £100,000,000, IN 20,000,000 SHARES OF £5 EACH.
THIS Company has been formed to acquire, combine into one, and
carry on the various old-established businesses of literary reviewing
hitherto carried on separately by Messrs. AN DBF. w LANG (who will
join the Board after allotment), GBANT ALLEN, W. E. GLADSTONE,
H. D. TRAILL, T. P. O'CONNOR, WALTER BESANT, ELKIN
MATHEWS, JOHN LANE, Q.., A.T.Q.C., UUILLER COUCH, RICHARD
LE GALLTENNE, and others. All these gentlemen have consented to act
as Directors. The advantages of the scheme
are obvious. Hitherto critical opinion, as
printed in the daily, weekly, and monthly
press, has been so diversified as to make it
impossible for the public to form a settled
judgment on books. For instance, a work
may be described in one place as "possess-
ing in the highest degree the master quali-
ties of brilliant humour and profound
Eathos"; while, in another notice, pub-
shed on the same day, it may be con-
clmined as " an essay in stupid buffoonery,
which mistakes inversion for paradox, and
makes a parade of sentiment as laughable
as its efforts at humour are melancholy."
It is the intention of the Directors to
change all this. Frequent Board-Meetings will be held, at which all
books sent for review will be carefully considered, with a view to
deciding how they shall be treated. The decisions thus come to will
be earned out in a series of articles extending with absolute uni-
formity over the whole field of contemporary literature.
PROFITS.
The profits of the business to be thus carried on must be gigantic.
After a careful inspection of the books of all British newt papers the
well-known accountants Messrs. LEGER AND BALLANCE have in-
formed the Directors that the gains of these papers from renewing
and literary gossip alone amount to £10,632,001) 12*. Id. annually. As
these papers will henceforth, on their literary side, be worked by the
Directors with all the latest improvements, even larger gains may be
looked for in the immediate future.
BOOMING.
This department will be managed by a paragraphist of unrivalled
experience, who will have under his orders a large staff of skilled
assistants thoroughly instructed in the use of the new patent
mitrailleuse Boomerangs, ten of which will be fixed in the chief office
of the Company at No. 1, Log Rolls Yard. Literary shareholders to
the amount of £500 and upwards will be entitled to a preferential
boom by way of bonus.
BLUDGEON WORK.
For this style of reviewing a separate department has been estab-
lished, under the joint management of three well-known literary
failures, Messrs. SCRIHLEY, FIBLEY AND GLIBLEY. By a careful
imitation of the worst models, and by assiduously cultivating their
own natural coarseness, the managers anticipate very remarkable
results. Style will be no object, but every worker in this depart-
ment will be expected to provide his own rhinoceros hide and stock of
allusions to RABBLUS. All holders of less than three shares will come
under the operation of this department. The Company intend shortly,
however, to issue £10 debentures, the owners of which will be per-
mitted once a year to ballot for the privilege of reviewing the book of
one of their friends.
INSURANCE SCHEME.
The Directors propose to organise a scheme of insurance against
hostile reviews and obdurate editors. For an annual payment of £21
an insurer will be entitled to one favourable review during the year;
for _ £30 he will be absolutely guaranteed against unfavourable
criticism. A small yearly payment, varying according to age, will en-
title his widow to claim £1000 at his death upon furnishing a certifi-
cate, signed by Mr. BESANT and the family doctor, that he died after
reading an unfavourable notice of one of his books. All literary men,
however, are recommended to subscribe £30 a year, thus obtaining a
life-long immunity from depreciation.
FEMALE BRANCH.
This will be known as the "George Department,"and will be con-
trolled by four new women of advanced views. Cigarettes, latch-
keys, and a summary of divorce court proceedings will be kept on the
premises. Novels turned out while you wait. Mrs. LYNN LINTON
will not be admitted during office hours.
SOMETHING NEW IN THE DRAMA.—Mr. HENRY IBVTNG, it appears,
has made a great hit in a one-part piece written by Dr. CONAN
DOYLE, entitled A Story of Waterloo. Probably Mr. J. L. TOOLE
will follow it up with A Story of Brandy-and- Waterloo, in which
P.S.—Is the moon mineral?
our cheerful comedian will appear as a regular Wetter'un.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MAKING THE RUNNINC WITH "THE DERBY WINNER."
DRURIOLANITS has scored another success. And why not? Surely
he deserves it, for, with the assistance of his two collaborators, CECIL
RALEIGH and HENRY HKMTLTOX, Sir AUGUSTUS n.vhuis ha? trained

"Three t> One on."
a Derby winner that will carry all before him over the Drury Lane
course until the place is required for the pantomime. And the train-
ing has been most judicious. The problem the three
stable companions (for the piece is nothing if not
horsey) set themselves was to produce a drama that
would till the Grand National Theatre both before and
behind the curtain. This problem they have solved
to the satisfaction of all parties.
The method adopted is simple enough. Take, for
instance, the Fjrst Act. One of the authors no doubt
suggested the inteiior of a country huuee. "Quite
so, says DRURIOLANCS, "a nobleman's country house.
I will show you how to do it." And he does. "O
Todgers's can do it when it likes!" Gorgeous hall
with a billiard table thrown in at the back to give
an idea of the luxury and magnitude. And then the
company! Earls and Countesses and Lords and
Ladies and a Duchess! Why, even the villain is a
major in a crack cavalry regiment, and the low
comedian a surgeon who has worn the Queen's uni-
form. Apparently to give the latter additional aris-
tocratic gloss, the Duchess is made to be in love with
him. And the plot? Why, of course. Let Miss
A I.M \ STANLEY arrive direct from India to sow dis-
cord between my Lord the hero and my Lady the
heroine. This she does, looking charming in htr
villainy, and wearing a striking costume. My Lord
tells her " to begone" (a most unreasonable request,
by the way, as she has arrived at the Hall in the
middle of the night, with evidently any number of
boxes), but she won't. Miss ALMA STANLEY prefers (o faint iu
my Lord's arms, to the great indignation of my Lady. Tableau
and curtain.
Next, please. The Downs, and a trial of the 'osses. Then we
have a meet of horses, saddle and otherwise. The "otherwise" are
harnessed to a pony-chaise that looks as if it had come from the
Lowther Arcade. Miss ALMA STANLEY rides in on a steed of her
own. My Lord, the hero, objects to the gracious presence of this fair
equestrian, and gets a horse-whipping for his trouble. Then the
trial comes off. The noble animals canter across the stage. The
dramatis permute describe their progress to one another as they make I
the running behind the scsnes. All first-rate and life-like. Haven't
we seen it ourselves in the early morn? Then they reappear (amidst
immense enthusiasm) as cardboard profile in the distance, to make
a final entry in the horseflesh from the 0. P. wings. Capitally done,
and a great success. Stalls, Circle, Pit, Boxes, and Gallery, all de-
lighted. So are they with the military ball at York. Nearly every body
in uniform. Hussars, Gunners, Highlanders, Fusileers, and Yeomen.
My Lord the hero appears as Colonel of his county Yeomanry. Quite
right, he has left the service, and taken to the reserve. Then there
is the cotillion, and my Lord ftntU himself, to his surprise, dancing
with Miss ALMA STANLEY. He is again caught by my Lady, the
heroine (the poor chap is always compromising himself at the wrong
moment), and there is of CDurse only one solution to this embar-
rassing situation, and that is,—curtain. No better ball scene been on
the staye for years. DRURIOLANCS has all the details at his finger-
tips, an<l the ball at his feet. Keep it rol ing I
In the next Act we find that the Countess, in full ball costume,
has eloped with the Villainous Major to a hotel. My Lady has
allowed her companion to describe themselves as Mr. and Mrs.
So-and-So in the porter's book. But thus far and no farther. When
the Major politely begs the loan of her heart, the Countess bids him
go, and treats him really with absolute rudeness. The Major,
after a terrible struggle with my Lady, in which he gets the worst of
it, is completely crushed, and probably inwardly laments the very
considerable expense to which he must have been put by the elope-
ment. At this crisis enter my Lord the hero. Row and tableau.
After this, the audience feels that the correct prescription is to cut
the dialogue and come to the " "osses." And to a great extent this
prescription is adopted. There is a first-class scene of a sale at
Tattersall's, and a very realistic view of the finish at the Derby. The
throng cheer behind the curtain, and so does the throng in front of it.
The task is complete: both sides of the green baize are crowded with
excited people.
It is exceptionally good. Scenery, music, general stage manage-
ment, and incidental music all excellent. Mrs. JOHN WOOD first-
rate, as good as ever, and Miss ALMA STANLEY greatly distinguishes
herself. So does Mr. CART WRIGHT as the most matter-of-fact villain
that "in this distressful country has ever yet been seen." When
he murders, or ruins, or seriously inconveniences anyone, he observes
sotto voce to himself, in a tone that would be equally appropriate
were he thanking an omnibus conductor for giving him change
for sixpence, "I thought I should do it." Then Mr. AKTHVB
BOURCHIER and Miss BEATRICE LAMB as My Lord and My Lady
could not be better. And Miss PATTIF. BROWNE, Miss L. MOODIB,
and Miss HETTIE DENE, all the right people in the right places, as
are both Mr. GKORGE GIDDIXS and Mr. LIONEL RIGXOLD. To sum
up, The Derby Winner has won, and Sir DRTJBIOLANUS has more

"Sold!"
than satisfied his enthusiastic backers the pubUc, and he and they
will have a real good run for their money. •• *

press, has been so diversified as to make it
impossible for the public to form a settled
judgment on books. For instance, a work
may be described in one place as "possess-
ing in the highest degree the master quali-
ties of brilliant humour and profound
pathos"; while, in another notice, pub-
lished on the same day, it may be con-
demned as " an essay in stupid buffoonery,
which mistakes inversion for paradox, and
makes a parade of sentiment as laughable
as its efforts at humour are melancholy."
It is the intention of the Directors to
change all this. Frequent Board-Meetings will be held, at which all
books sent for review will be carefully considered, with a view to
deciding how they shall be treated. The decisions thus come to will
be carried out in a series of articles extending with absolute uni-
formity over the whole field of contemporary literature.
PROFITS.
The profits of the business to be thus carried on must be gigantic.
After a careful inspection of the books of all British newt papers the
well-known accountants Messrs. LEGER AMD BALLANCK have in-
formed the Directors that the gains of these papers from reriewing
and literary gossip alone amount to £10,632,009 12s. Id. annually. As
these papers will nenceforth, on their literary side, be worked by the
Directors with all the latest improvements, even larger gains may be
looked for in the immediate future.
BOOMING.
This department will be managed by a paragraphist of unrivalled
experience, who will have under his orders a large staff of skilled
assistants thoroughly instructed in the use_ of the new patent
mitrailleuse Boomerangs, ten of which will be fixed in the chief office
of the Company at No. 1, Log Rolls Yard. Literary shareholders to
the amount of £500 and upwards will be entitled to a preferential
boom by way of bonus.
BLUDGEON WORK.
For this style of reviewing a separate department has been estab-
lished, under the joint management of three well-known literary
failures, Messrs. SCRIBLEY, FIBLEY AND GLIULEY. By a careful
imitation of the worst models, and by assiduously cultivating their
own natural coarseness, the managers anticipate very remarkable
results. Style will be no object, but every worker in this depart-
ment will be expected to provide his own rhinoceros hide and stock of
allusions to RABELAIS. All holders of less than three shares will come
under the operation of this department. The Company intend shortly,
however, to issue £10 debentures, the owners of which will be per-
mitted once a year to ballot for the privilege of reviewing the book of
one of their friends.
INSURANCE SCHEME.
The Directors propose to organise a scheme of insurance against
hostile reviews and obdurate editors. For an annual payment of £'21
an insurer will be entitled to one favourable review during the year;
for £30 he will be absolutely guaranteed against unfavourable
criticism. A small yearly payment, varying according to age, will en-
title his widow to claim £1000 at his death upon furnishing a certifi-
cate, signed by Mr. BESANT and the family doctor, that he died after
reading an unfavourable notice of one of his books. All literary men,
however, are recommended to subscribe £30 a year, thus obtaining a
life-long immunity from depreciation.
FEMALE BRANCH.
This will be known as the " George Department," and will he con-
trolled by four new women of advanced views. Cigarettes, latch-
keys, and a summary of divorce court proceedings will be kept on the
premises. Novels turned out while you wait. Mrs. LYNN LINTON
will not be admitted during office hours.
SOMETHING NEW IN THE DRAMA.—Mr. HENRY IRVING, it appears,
has made a great hit in a one-part piece written by Dr. CONAN
DOYLE, entitled A Story of Waterloo. Probably Mr. J. L. TOOLE
will follow it up with A !Sh>ry of Brandy-arid- Waterloo, in which
P.S.—Is the moon mineral?
our cheerful comedian will appear as a regular Wetter'un.

MAKING THE RUNNING WITH "THE DERBY WINNER."
DB.URIOLANUS has scored another success. And why not? Surely
he deserves it, for, with the assistance of his two collaborators, CECIL
RALEIGH and HENRY HAMILTON-, Sir Accusrcs II viuus hi? trained

"Three t> Cne on."
a Derhy winner that will carry all before him over the Drury Lane
course until the place is required for the pantomime. And the train-
ing has been most judicious. The problem the three
stable companions (for the piece is nothing if not
horsey)_ set themselves was to produce a drama that
would fill the Grand National Theatre both before and
behind the curtain. This problem they have solved
to the satisfaction of all parties.
The method adopted is simple enough. Take, for
instance, the First Act. One of the authors no doubt
suggested the inteiior of a country house. "Quite
so, says DKUBIOLANCS, "a nobleman's country house.
I^will show you how to do it." And he does. "()
Todgers's can do it when it likes!" Gorgeous hall
with a billiard table thrown in at the back to give
an idea of the luxury and magnitude. And then the
company! Earls and Countesses and Lords and
Ladies and a Duchess! Why, even the villain is a
major in a crack cavalry regiment, and the low
comedian a surgeon who has worn the Queen's uni-
form. Apparently to give the latter additional aris-
tocratic gloss, the Duchess is made to be in love with
him. And the plot? Why, of course. Let Miss
A I..M \ STANLEY arrive direct from India to sow dis-
cord between my Lord the hero and my Lady the
heroine. This she does, looking charming in her
villainy, and wearing a striking costume. My Lord
tells her "to begone" (a most unreasonable request,
by the way, as she has arrived at the Hall m the
middle of the night, with evidently any number of
boxes), but she won't. Miss ALMA STANLEY prefers to faint in
my Lord's arms, to the great indignation of my Lady. Tableau
and curtain.
Next, please. The Downs, and a trial of the 'osses. Then we
have a meet of horses, saddle and otherwise. The "otherwise" are
harnessed to a pony-chaise that looks as if it had come from the
Lowther Arcade. Miss ALMA STANLEY rides in on a steed of her
own. My Lord, the hero, objects to the gracious presence of this fair
equestrian, and gets a horse-whipping for his trouble. Then the
trial comes off. The noble animals canter across the stage. The
dramatis personas describe their progress to one another as they make
the running behind the scsnes. All first-rate and life-like. Haven't
we seen it ourselves in the early morn if Then they reappear (amidst
immense enthusiasm) as cardboard profile in the distance, to make
a final entry in the horseflesh from the O. P. wings. Capitally done,
and a great success. Stalls, Circle, Pit. Boxes, and Gallery, all de-
lighted. So are they with the military ball at York. Nearly everybody
in uniform. Hussars, Gunners, Highlanders, Fusilcers, and Yeomen.
My Lord the hero appears as Colonel of his county Yeomanry. Quite
right, he has left the service, and taken to the reserve. Then there
is the cotillion, and my Lord finds himself, to his surprise, dancing
with Miss ALMA STANLEY. He is again caught by my Lady, the
heroine (the poor chap is always compromising himself at the wrong
moment), and there is of course only one solution to this embar-
rassing situation, and that is,—curtain. No better ball scene been on
the stage for yiars. DRUKIOLANCS has all the details at his finger-
lips, an-1 the ball at hU feet. Keep it rol ins I
In the next Act we find that the Countess, in full ball costume,
has eloped with the Villainous Major to a hotel. My Lady has
allowed her companion to describe themselves as Mr. and Mrs.
So-and-So in the porter's book. But thus far and no farther. When
the Major politely begs the loan of her heart, the Countess bids him
go, and treats him really with absolute rudeness. The Major,
after a terrible struggle with my Lady, in which he gets the worst of
it, is completely crushed, and probably inwardly laments the very
considerable expense to which he must have been put by the elope-
ment. At this crisis enter my Lord the hero. Row and tableau.
After this, the audience feels that the correct prescription is to cut
the dialogue and come to the "'osses." And to a great extent this
prescription is adopted. There is a first-class scene of a sale at
Tattersall's, and a very realistic view of the finish at the Derby. The
throng oheer behind the curtain, and so does the throng in front of it.
The task is complete: both sides of the green baize are crowded with
excited people.
It is exceptionally good. Scenery, music, general stage manage-
ment, and incidental music all excellent. Mrs. JOHN WOOD first-
rate, as good as ever, and Miss ALMA STANLEY greatly distinguishes
herself. So does Mr. CABTWBIGHT as the most matter-of-fact villain
that "in this distressful country has ever yet been seen." When
he murders, or ruins, or seriously inconveniences anyone, he observes
sotto voce to himself, in a tone that would be equally appropriate
were he thanking an omnibus conductor for giving him change
for sixpence, "I thought I should do it." Then Mr. ARTHUR
BotmcniER and Miss BEATBICE LAMB as My Lord and My Lady
could not be better. And Miss PATTIE BROWNE, Miss L. MOODIK,
and Miss HETTIE DENE, all the right people in the right places, as
are both Mr. GKORCE GIDDIXS and Mr. LIONEL RIGXOLD. To sum
up, The Derby Winner has won, and Sir DBUBIOLANVS has more

"Sold!"
than satisfied his enthusiastic backers the public, and he and they
will have a real good run for their money. •» *

LETTERS FROM A DEBUTANTE.
DEAREST MABJORIE,—It is really quite time you gave me some
more of your valuable advice. Thanks to you, 1 was not such an
utter failure in my first season as I expected. After a month at
home (my people loathe the new way I do my hair, and it seemed, I
am ashamed to say, a little dull there), I have come to stay again
with the I-TON TAYMERS at their country house.
/ You remember I refused the man who
did conjuring tricks? He has written to
me since to say he sees now how right I
was—rather crushing! I also fully in-
tended to refuse Captain MASHINGTON.
But he went to Dinard without giving me
the opportunity, and I hear he has been
playing tennis there the whole day with
Mrs. LORNE HOPPER. I am sure I hope
he enjoyed it. She is what you or I would
consider rather old, but is said to be per-
fectly charming, and of course looks
fifteen years younger than her youngest
daughter.
It seems rather strange, doesn't it,
MARJOHIE, that after being so wonderfully
sensible all the season, I should suddenly
do something quite idiotic in September?
. However, I hare : and I want you to help
me out of it. I '11 tell you all, if you '11
promise not to laugh. When I first came, I was "thrown, as people
say, a good deal with the TAYMER'S nephew—ORIEL CRAMPTON who
ha's just left Oxford. I was told he was very serious, rather shy,
philanthropic, and has "views"; also that he had done a great deal
of good in the West End. This interested me, and I tried to draw
him out. They had omitted to mention that he was dreadfully sus-
ceptible. We talked for hours in the garden, nearly all the time—
at first—about the housing of the rich and horrible cases of over-
crowding—at London parties. He was very earnest and ascetic (he
never drinks anything but hot water, and doesn't smoke); he lent me
books-^he is rather handsome—and—gradually—somehow I found I
had drifted into an absurd sort of private half-engagement! -Yes—
I have actually a bangle riretted on—with a date inside—the date I
was insane enough to agree Isn't it dreadful?
ORIEL will be well off, but he intends to spend all his money on
founding model slums, where the people are to be teetotallers and do
bootmaking or something, and be a happy little colony. ORIEL'S
views may necessitate his doing a little cobbling himself—just to set
an example. I was enormously impressed by this at first; but I am
afraid I have become frivolous again. Some other people hare come
here, including a nice boy they call BABY BEAUMONT. He is
really almost nineteen, but wonderfully well preserved, very clever,
and sj cynical that he is quite an optimist. Almost directly, he
asked me how long I had known ORIEL CRAMPTON. I said about a
fortnight. "Ah! then you must be engaged to him. Poor old
ORIEL! He's really quite extraordinarily old-fashioned."
"How old is he? 1 asked, in faltering tones.
"He has rather a way of pretending to be young, I fancy. But he
must be four-and-twenty if he is a day. You need not say I told you."
It's evidently the fashion to be very young—lot men, at least.
Sometimes I wish it were the fashion to be old enough to know
better. If ORTEL really has been engaged before, and may be again,
and if getting engaged to people is only a sort of habit of his, perhaps
he would not mind so very much if I were to break it off.
BABY BEATJMOBT is (he says himself) ''frankly Pagan." He
thinks ORIEL too serious for me, and advises me to marry at leisure,
as I am quite sure, anyhow, to repent in haste. He wanted to send
a paragraph to the Post to say " A marriage has been arranged, and
will shortly be broken off, between Mr. ORTEL CRAMPTON and Miss
GLADYS MAYFIELD, younger daughter," and so on.
Last night, when we were playing games, ORIEL went out while we
thought of a word, and he got quite angry with me because I had said
the moon was " vcgetab'e and he said it was "mineral." He may
be right, or he may not—I daresay he is—but still he need not be
touchy, and refuse to play any more, and sulk all the evening.
I am afraid I should not be happy with him. He collects postage
stamps, too, which depresses me dreadfully.
PCeate write and tell me what to do—or rather, how to do it. Can
one get a bangle riretted off? . . . I have just heard that the LORNE
HOPPERS and Captain MISHINGTON are coming to play tennis on
Sunday! Of course, I shall show absolute indifference. I wired at
once to town for my new dress. Mrs. HOPPER may as well see it.
BABY BEAUMONT is always changing his clothes, and has two
button-holes sent down from London daily. He says he "intends to
revive the gardenia." . . . ORIEL has just gone out for a 'brisk
walk before dinner." Aren't we utterly unsuitcd to each other?
Your loving friend, GLADYS.

THE GENERAL LITERARY REVIEW COMPANY, LIMITED.
CAPITAL £100,000,000, IN 20,000,000 SHARES OF £5 EACH.
THIS Company has been formed to acquire, combine into one, and
carry on the various old-established businesses of literary reviewing
hitherto carried on separately by Messrs. ANDREW LAXG (who will
join the Board after allotment), GBANT ALLEN, W. E. GLADSTONE,
H. D. TRAILL, T. P. O'CONNOR, WALTER BESANT, ELKIN
MATHEWS, JOHN LANE, Q,., A.T.Q.C., UUILLER Coucn, RICHARD
LE GALLIENNE, and others. All these gentlemen have consented to act
as Directors. The advantages of the scheme
are obvious. Hitherto critical opinion, as
printed in the daily, weekly, ana monthly
press, has been so diversified as to make it
impossible for the public to form a settled
judgment on books. For instance, a work
may be described in one place as " possess-

AIR—" / 'm Getting a Big Girl Now!"
I'VE had all the pleasures belonging to youth,
Its sweetmeats, its larks, and its toys.
But I find, with regret, what is really the
truth,
That girls will grow old, just like boys.
I 'd like still to play in the jolly old way,
But the world will not let me somehow.
I know what it means; I am now in my
teens.
Yes; I 'in getting a big girl now!
Chorus.
I "m getting a big girl now,
And they tell me it's time I knew how
To behave more like one,
And in toys find less fun;
For I 'm getting a big girl now!
I 've had a good time for a number of years,
And I 'm sure I 'm not anxious to change,
But the very best swim there is somiboay
queers.
They won't let me alone—it's so strange!
It does give one a shock; but I 've outgrown
my frock.
My girdle won't meet anyhow;
They're beginning to quiz. Ah! I see DOT
it is;
I 'm getting a big girl now
Chorus.
I 'm getting a big girl now,
If I romp someone kicks up a row
They tell me I chuck
Too much money on "tuck" !—
I know there's a party who's anxious to spoil
My nice little games at Guildhall.
He growls " turn up turtle and toys, Miss,

Gog and Magog are no good at all.
Your coaches, aud horses, and tin-armoured

more among so many. I came
here, Sir, for a purpose, as you

Spurr. (ruefully). Your dresi
clothes? All right, you shall
have them directly. I wouldn't
have put 'em on if I 'd known
they 'd be wanted so soon.
t'nd. I should have thought
your own would have been more
comfortable.
Spurr. More comfortable! I
believe you. Why, I assure you
I feel like a Bath bun in a baby's
sock! But how was I to know?
You shouldn't leave your things
about like that!
I'nd. It is usual, Sir, for
people to come to a place like this prjvided with evening clothes of
their own.
Spurr. I know that as well as you do. Don't you suppose I 'm
unacquainted with the usages of society! Why, I've stayed in
boarding-houses at the seaside many a time where it was do rigger
to dress—even for high tea! But coming down, as I did, on
business, it never entered my head that I should want my dress suit.
So when I found them all as chummy and friendly as possible, and
expecting me to dine as a matter of course,—why, 1 can tell you I was
too jolly glad to get hold of anything in the shape of a swallowtail
and white choker to be over particular 1
Und. You seem to havo been more fortunate in your reception than
I. But then /had not the advantage of being here in a business
capacity.
Spurr. Well, it wasn't that altogether, You see, I 'm a kind of
a celebrity in my way.
Und, I should hardly have thought that would be a recommenda-

"He suddenly comes face to face with his own reflection."
Spurr. I was surprised myself to find what a lot they thought of
it; but, bless you, they're all as civil as shopwalkers; and, as for
the ladies, why, the old Countess and Lady MAISIE and Lady KHODA
couldn't be more complimentary jf I 'd won the Victoria Cross, instead
of getting a first prize for breeding and exhibiting a bull bitch at
CBUFT'S Dog Show!
I'nd. (bitterli/, to himself). And this is our aristocracy! They
make a bosom friend of a breeder of dogs; and find a poet only fit to
associate with their servants! What a themefor a satirist! (Aloud.)
I see nothing to wonder at. You possess precisely the social qualifi-
cations most likely to appeal to the leisured class.
Spttrr, Oh, there's a lot of humbug in it, mind you! Most of 'em
know about as much of the points of a bull as the points of a compass,
only they let on to know a lot because they think it's smart. And
some of 'em are after a pup from old Drummy's next litter. / see
through all that, you know!
I 'nd. You are a cynic, I observe, Sir. But possibly the nature of
the business which brings yon here renders them
Spurr. That's the rummest
thing about it. I haven't heard
a word about that yet. I'm in
the veterinary profession, you
know. Well, they sent for me to
see some blooming horse, and
never even ask me to go near it!
Seems odd, don't it?
I'nd. (/<> himself). I had to go
near the blooming horse! Now I
begin to understand; the very
servants did not expect to find a
professional vet in any company
but their own! (Aloud.) I—I
trust that the horse will not
suffer through any delay.
Spurr. Sa do I; but how dn I
know that some ignorant duffer
mayn't be treating him for the
wrong thing? It maybe all np
with the animal before I get a
chance of seeing what I can do I
I'nd. (to himself). If he knew
how near I went to getting the
poor beast shot! But I needn't
mention that now.
Spurr. I don't say it isn't gra-
tifying to be treated like a swell,
but I've got my professional re-
putation to consider, you know;

Und. (to himself, orertchelmed, as the Sutler's step is heard

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
OCB GEOBGE DU MAUKIER is in analagons case to that of a
dramatic character of whom he may possibly have heard. M. Jour-
dain one day happed upon the discovery that he had been talking
prose all his life without knowing it. Mr. ws MAURIEIS has lived
through half a century-master of an
exquisite style, and only now makes
the discovery known to --the world.
Plain indications of the fact4 were
given in Peter Ibbetson. But in re-
spect of style and in other matters,
Trilby, just published by Osooon,
MclLVAiNZ & Co., is a prodigious im-
provement. That a man who has
made bis mark in pencil should, on
taking up his pen, disclose possession
of the rare gift of style, strikes the
literary person with more marvel even
than is evoked by discovery of a new
novelist who can construct a plot and
delineate character. Mr. DC MADTUBH
has rich endowment of all these gifts,
which shine on every jiage of Trilby.
He has, moreover, given us a new
thine quite apart from the run of
English novels. HENRI MUBGER was
before him with a deathless book in
which life in the ftuartier Latin is
powerfully and tenderly portrayed.
Mr. DC MAURIEE'S chapters on student
«__ ,.. .,, life in Paris need not fear comparison
Accompanying Trilby. ^ ^ ^ Jg Sohim,t wnich ig
praise of the kind Sir HUBERT STANLEY hoarded. Beyond that,
growing out of it, is the boldly conceived, firmly-drawn, and charm-
ingly coloured character of Trilby, with her curious entourage, her
varied life, and her tragic end. Little Billee, in whom some will
find revived lost memories of a dear friend, is a charming personality,
whilst Taffy and the Laird are live men. With such wealth of
material and such felicity of touch, Mr. nu MAURJER might well have
foregone the temptation of allowing Little Eillee to hold forth on
theological subjects to his dog, at a length inevitable in the pulpit,
but a little out of place as an interlude in a novel. This passage
supplies a jarring note in an otherwise almost perfect symphony.
One turns with eagerness to the Life trf trances Poicer Cobbe,
more especially when it bean the honoured imprimatur of BENTLEY.
Miss COBBE has lived long, enjoying full opportunity of seeing things
and people. She ought to have written a good book. "Instead of
which," as the jndge_ onoe said, she presents a slovenly-written, ill-
digested mass of miscellaneous matter, including whole chapters

from most aspects, she particularly admires her literary style. There
is a passage in the book where she* plaintively apprehends that, lost
in admiration of her style, readers may miss the true purpose and
importance of her writing;—this in volumes that bristle with such
monstro&ities as "compared to," "disapproved of," and "from
thence," the latter a favourite foible of Miss COBBE'S style. In the
second volume there are some attempts at what was naturally
looked for, to wit, reminiscences of people the present generation
would like to meet. But the burly, complacent figure of the diarist
intervenes just as they come into view. She tells us what she said
to them, not, what we are burning to hear, what they said to her.
On the whole, looked at through Miss COBBE'S spectacles, they were
a poor lot. Of RENAN she writes, "The impression he has left on
me is one of disappointment and short-falling." Short-falling is
"style" of the athletic order, and, my Baronite vaguely surmises, is
the opposite of high jumping. As to poor CARLYLE, Miss COBBE '' never
shared the admiration felt for him by so many able men." GEOHOE
BOBROW, who wrote The Bible in Spain, she " never liked, think-
ing him more or less a hypocrite. Professor TYNDAL is more
i in favour, since, in reply to the gift of one of Miss COBBE'S instruct-
! ive books, the Professor wrote an acknowledgment, the exquisite
! irony of which his correspondent evidently does not see. One other
partial concession is made in a passage sublime in its fatuousness.
Speaking of one of her books, of which the fortunate reader will find
a full summary in the first volume, Miss COBBE says, "It was very
favourably reviewed, but some of my fellow Theists rather disap-
proved of the tribute I had paid to Christ." The volumes bear on
the front the COME coat of arms and motto. The family may, we
are assured, be traced back through four centuries, and, even in the
present degenerate days, is highly connected.
Whilst the great heart of the people is considering whether it
shall throb against the House of Lords or whether it shall forbear,
Mr. SWIFT MACXEILL, (I.C., M.P., has delivered at that ancient
institution what the Marchioness was accustomed to describe ns " a
wonner." Titled Corruption is the alluring style of the neatlv-
bound volume issued by FISHEH UHWIS. There is, my Itaronite
says, a touch of artistic genius in the contrast between the plain,
unassuming calico binding of the book and the blood and thunder
that rolls through its pages. It is " the sordid origin of some Irish
peerages" that Mr. SWIFT M*cNEin undertakes to set forth.
Perhaps if he were solely responsible for the work, its startling
statements might be dismissed as coloured by fervid fancy. He,
however, supports himself with the dictum of Mr. LECKY, "the
majority of Irish titles are historically connected with memories not
of honour but of shame," and illustrates It by extracts from con-
fidential letters of Lords Lieutenants of Ireland, recommending
gentlemen for the peerage, Altogether an interesting withdrawal
of the curtain dropped before passages in the history of Ireland on
the eve of the Union,
Signed and approved in the Baronite Office by
devoted to digests of her published works. Pleased with herself!

FRAGMENT OF A POLICE
"REPORT D'ARTHUR."
THEN he that made the little songs
For ARTHUR— deftly could he make
the same —
Budged not ; but ARTHUR rose and
silently,
Whether by malice of the mind
prepense,
Or by the merest inadvertency,
(As he alleged that felt it,) drew his
list ,
And smote him on the digit heavily,
And ceased. • • • •
Butlo!
ARTHUR was 'ware of one that
winkfd on him,
Clothed all in sable, stout, CDD-
stabular:
Then murmured ARTHUR, "Plact
me in the dock!"
So to the dock they came eventually .
And there the pressmen came and
sampled him;
And later came the Bar and pleaded
for him:
And last the Bench observed, '' More
tilings are wrought
By misadventure than you might
suppose.
And such the case before us; yea,
a tort
Committed in a temporary state
Of fheer oblivion. We dismiss the
suit."
So from the Court serenely AuTitnt
passed,
And passing held communion with
UBMU
How he fhould work it up for future
FRIENDLY FRENCH FEELINU AND
FISHING. — Oh, of course, nothing
could be nicer. They are so fond
of us English in France! Can't
possibly do without us. The latest
development of it, in a small way,
being the seizure of a Ramsgate
fi-hinp-smack, called the Bonnie
Bell, by a French fishing-boat,
which hauled the B. B. into
Gravelines. "Hard lines" this.
Anyway it is a nasty fishing
"smack" in the eye, given ana
taken. And where s the friendly
feeling?

AN AWFUL OUTLOOK.
(For "Lore in the Arbour.")
A DARWINITE tells us some flowers

This adds a new terror to botany.
For lovers, and ladies, will surely
agree
Blossoms' tongues could tell talcs
—had they got any:
The Fat Hoy' in I'icktrick, an
Arbour-eaves-dropper,
To amorous "spoons was a
terror;
But flowers with eyes for what
Aunts call "improper"?
That is a look-out, and no error!
'Tis climbers and parasites chiefly,
we 're told,
Who 're gifted with optical
powers.
Well nymphs will be roguish, and
swains will be hold,
Notwithstanding inquisitive —
flowers!
The Virgin, no doubt, will invite
the sly kiss,
Despite the Virginian Creeper;
And Ciirt/tlon clasp in the moon-
light sweet miss
Though Convolvulus play Tom
the Peeper.
But should science discover that
blossoms can *i>rak,
And tell talcs about bower-hid
passion;
I '11 wager it wouldn't be more than
a week, [fashion!
Before flowers would po out of
One prospect at least this new doc-
trine discovers:
Did eyes and glib tongues fill our

The man whom a maiden deems
"flower of lovers,"
Wuuld no more be lover of flowers

THE MATRON'S HISS.
(An Apologue with an Application.)
[A lady-bicyclist the other day, riding in "rational dress," was roundly
hissed by an elderly Mrs. GRI'NUY, standing by. The wheel-woman is said
to have retorted, " Are you teamen who thus hies me'! When vou bathe,

"EOT," said the Proud Briton to the Perfect Stranger, "in addi-
tion to our armies and fleets, our religions and our laws, our parsons
and our policemen, we have
one Protective Power, moral
palladium and social togis in
one, whose value outweighs
that of all others."
The Perfect Stranger
looked surprised.
"And what," said he, "is
that?"
"We call it the ' Matron's
Hiss,'" replied the Proud
Briton, with enigmatical
complacency. "Anything
contra bonos mores, had

the' Matron's Hiss.'"
Quoth thePerfectStranger,
"I should like to observe it
in operation."
"You shall!" said the
Proud Briton.
*••»*•
The Perfect Stranger, under Ihe guidance of the Proud Briton
went everywhere and saw everything.
He saw a sweet, though appirently semi-suffocated, young girl
dressed (or, as he would T>y unaided judgment have concluded, un-
dressed) for her first ball.
He saw an elderly fine ladv, a high-nosed dame de par le monde,
prepared—he would have said, painted and glazed—for a high, social
"function."
He saw a fair ingniue, under the eyes of her vigilant mamma and

permanent partners, an elderly
but opulent Satyr, and a youth-
ful, brainless, but titled Clolen.
He heard conversation which
the talkers themselves laughingly
called risque (and which he would
grimly have called rude) at
fashionable dinner-tables be-
tween smirking matrons and
leering elderly men.
He witnessed the vagaries of
despot Fashion, the (as he con-
sidered) "immodesty" of "full
dress," the "impropriety" of
flagrant "oosmeticism,"the "nn-
healthiness" of inadequate or su-
perfluous clothing, the " cruelty"
of corsets, the vulgarity" and
wanton murderousness of bird-
destroying feather trimmings.
These, and many more follies,
improprieties and wickedness the
Perfect Stranger was wondering
witness of.
"But," observed the Perfect
Stranger, "where is the 'Ma-
tron's Hiss'?"
"Oh !" replied the Proud Bri-
ton, with some embarrassment,
"but in all this there is nothing
new, you know, nothing unprece-
dented, innovating, subversive of
accepted Social Laws; nothing
'bad form,' that is to say un-
usual, unexpected, unconsecrated
by respectable usage. If there is
anything Naughty, it is not New, and what is—possibly—New is not
Naughty. Therefore, there is no call for that omnipotent Hiss!"
nmph! What then would elicit it?" inquired the Perfect
Stranger.
That is a bit difficult to define, off-hand," answered the Proud
Briton, hesitatingly. "Say, for example, a natural waist, or
ibsence of corsets, high-dress at a Court function, marriage for
,ove—which in Society or in the tennis-court is equivalent to nothing
—wearing an unfashionable hat, or four-buttoned gloves when
six are de regie, sounding your g's (when fashion dictates
their being dropped), or not sounding your h's (till fashion tells
yon to drop them}, blushing inopportunely—say, at the stare of a
duke or the 'suggestiveness' of a millionaire—showing sympathy
jut of your own 'set,' objecting to tailor-made attire or accepted
bathing-costume, discussing questions of sex in a spirit of serious
sympathy instead of through some decadent Art-medium; being
earnest, original, or tpontaneous in any way, and thus defying
Society's golden rule, 'Do always as others do.'"
"Is that the Masterful Matron's sole rule?" queried the Perfect
Stranger.
"Substantially yes," replied the Proud Briton; "_ though it is
supplemented, perhaps, by the corollary, 'Never be either the first
or the last to do a new thing.'"
"Then," commented the Perfect Stranger, "the Matron's Hiss
would be tilent at the fight of bared shoulders and bust in mid-
winter, but would sound with anserine shrillness at the sight of a
lady's lower limbs comfortably, and conveniently, and healthily, and
decently t but unconventionally, clad in summer on a cycle?"
"Precisely!" said the Proud Briton, though perhaps with less of
British pride than usual.
"Then," said the Perfect Stranger, " I think your Histing Matron
is a silly, despotic, cackling old goose, who will never save the social
Capitol! But who and what is that?"
That was a portly, florid, and high-nosed elderly dame, of
pompous demeanour, and flamboyant raiment, elaborately and
obviously cosmetiqued, and arrayed in a startlingly low-cut garment.
"That," said the Proud Briton, with an uneasy smile, is Mrs.
GRUNDV, the great Goose-Autocrat, the Palladium of Propriety, the
yEgis of Social Morality, the very Masterful Matron of whom we
have been talking."
"Then" demanded the Perfect Stranger, with staggering perti-
mnce, " Why does she not Hiss at Herself?"
The Proud Briton was silent.
THE LOBD MAYOR ELECT.—The incoming Lord Mayor has already
shown himself a "Man of Letters" as he communicated a letter of
thanks for kind wishes to pretty well every leading journal. These,
chaperon, in one evening waltzing with, and trying to win, as more
when collected, may be published as a new " Renals Miscellany."

could not be married at all.

with them, bat at the same

my plan, and it answers ad-

day declined to surrender the
morning paper to me, and told
me she would like to be a "New

answered; "then yon won't
object to my being a New Man

her securely to the strongest

AMANDA, I, your faithful slave,

That yon expect me to behave

To falter forth my vows sincere
In syllables disjointed;

I ought, I candidly allow,
In sitting-rooms and places
To stride about with gloomy brow
And agitated paces;
But in athletic sports I'm sure
I always was a duffer,

Most certainly would suffer.

My duty is, I know, to

My matutinal bacon.

LETTERS FROM A DEBUTANTE.
MY DEAR MABJORIE,—You are hard on poor ORIBI. CHAMPION'
when you pay that philanthropy, brisk walks, a bad temper, and a
taste for collecting postage-stamps, form the most hideous combina-
tion any human being could imagine. Of course, I admit he's a
little dreary. All is now over between us. Things reached a climax
<me rainy afternoon when BABY BEAUMONT, in a mood of intense
juvenility, offered " to teach OHIEL to make barley-sugar." Forget-
ing his school-days. OHIEL patronisingly said he was glad to learn,
from anyone. 80 BABY seized ORIEL'S arm, twisted it round in
the classical manner, and then hit the twist. It was quite impos-
sible to help laughing when OHIEL, pale with fury, declared he
could take a joke, supposed this was the New Humour, and left the
room. I' What can you expect," said BABY, "of the middle-aged'("
(ORIEL is not twenty-four yet.)
That evening I wrote a note, putting an end to our engagement.
I gave it to him in the billiard-room, and—he pave me one at the
same time, and—to the tame effect.' I felt dreadfully hurt at his
throwing me over. He wrote, ''I feel I have no right to ask you, who
are so fitted to bhine in the society of the gnu and drcadent" (tbis
meant BABY), "to share a life that will be wholly dedicated to the
amelioration of the condition of the poorer classes," &c.
In the midst of our agitation, we were compelled to play "musical
chairs" with the other*, as if nothing had happened! What a
monkery it seemed!
We parted amicably. He asked if I should like to hear, from
lime to time, of the progress of his life-work, and / promi ed to be
his sister. . . . When he went away, a stringe sense 01 loss came ovt r
me. . . . One page in my life had been turned for ever! . . . BABY
tiled to console me by observing that now there would be a chance of
getting plenty of hot water for baths. QUIET, used to drink it all.
At the tennis-party MM. LOBNE HOPPER seemed utterly bored by
Captain MASDINOTON. She said my dress wanted " taking up on the
I should hope they were!) Mr. LORNE HOPPER seemed nice, and
very quiet, and harmless at first, but it gradually came out that
he does sketches at the piano in the style of CORNEY GRAIS, and what
is worse, expects to be asked to do them.
Lady TAYMER implored us all to laugh, and we did our best to
please our hostess; but the room was nearly empty in five minutes.
At dinner, BABY talked of the bad taste and imbecility of practical
joke*. In the evening, he wrote to seventeen periodicals denying
he had written The Maure Camellia, and asking to have it con-
tradicted. We waltzed. Captain MASHINUTON dances better than
ever, and has nice eyes. That night I found hair-brushes in my
bed, I see nothing funny in it, and shall not fpeak to BABY
BEAUMONT until he apologises.
Great excitement prevailed here last week. It was discovered that
SAMOVAKSKI, the great Russian pianist, was in the neighbourhood.
He accepted an invita'i m to come here for two days. Imagine the
joy of the LYON TAVMBKS! They sent out invitations with "To
meet M. SAMOVAHSKI," printed on the cards. He is known to be
rather erratic, but as he was actually to stay in the house it seemed
quite safe. Thirty-fix people came to a dinner in his honour.
SAMOVARSKI arrived at seven, asked for some lager beer, and
went straight to bed. Nothing on earth would induce him to get
up, or even to unlock his door or answer an inquiry. It was a
terrible evening. The TAYMEHS hoped on fur the next day. The
great compiser got up at two. Many people had stayed on the
ehance of hearing him play. It was a beautiful day, and Lady
TAYMER entreated to be allowed to drive him round the mighboiir-
hood. He declined, and spent the whole afternoon playing piquet wilb
hU secretary. At dinner, he talked absurdities about the Chinese war,
nfusing tvi n to mention mufric—which it seems he detests—and then,
verv courteously, \x gged to be excused, as he had to correct the proof s
of his article "Impress-ions of English Country Life" for some Moscow
journal. ... Do not mention the subject to the TAYMEBS when you

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THE Assistant-Reader has been at work, and makes the following
report:—
A pretty little volume is Mr. ANTHONY C. DEAXE'S Holiday
Rhymes (HENRY & Co). That its merits are high may be safely
inferred from the fact that the largest instalment of its verses came
from the columns of Mr. Punch. Mr. DEANE handles his varied
metres with great skill, his style is neat and pointed, his rhymes are
above reproach,? and his satire, especially when he deals with

literary and academic matters, hits hard and straight. And, though
the author is a Deane, he never sermonises. But why not sermons
in verse? I commend the idea to Mr. DEANE. He could carry it
out excellently, and earn the thanks of countless congregations.
Messrs. METHCEN are publishing a series of English Classics,
edited by Mr. W. E. HENLEY. They have started with Tristram
Shandy, and have persuaded a Mr. CHARLES WHIBLEY to introduce
LAURENCE STEBXE to the reading public of the present day.
"Permit me," says Mr. WHIBLEY, in effect, "to present to your
notice LAURENCE STERNE, plagiarist, sentimentalist, and dealer in
the obscene," a right pleasant and comfortable introduction, setting
us all at our ease, and predisposing us at once in favour of
the humble candidate for fame, whom Mr. WHIBLEY alter-
nately kicks and patronises. 'Tis pity (I have caught Mr. WHIB-
LEY'S own trick) that Mr. WHIBLEIT had not the writing of
Tristram Shancli/. He, at any rate—so he seems to think—
would never have outraged our sense of decency, or moved us
to "thrills of a)sthetic disirnsV by such platitudes as My Uncle
Tobt/'s address to the fly. RABELAIS, it appears (Mr. WDIBLEY has
got R.IBKLAIS on the brain, he is Pantagruelocephalous), RABELAIS
may steal a horse, but STERNE must not look over a hedge. One
may have no wish to defend the "indecencies" of STERNE, but to
condemn them by contrasting them with the efforts of RABELAIS
is a highly modernised form of criticism, of which I should scarcely
have supposed even a WHIBLEY cajpable. On the whole, I cannot
commend this introduction, with its jingling, tin-pot, sham-fantastic
style. I feel inclined to cry out aloud with Master Peter, "Plain-
ness, good boy; do not you soar so high; this affectation is scurvy."
And why is Mr. WHIBLEY so hard upon the suburbs? Jlis own
manner of writing is excellently calculated to fascinate Clapham,
and move Peckham Rye to an enthusiasm of admiration.
Messrs. CHATTO AND WINDTJS have brought to a happy conclusion
their monumental work of republishinjr the CAMPBELL AND STEBBINO
translation of Thiers' History of the Consulate and Empire. It is in
twelve neatly bound, conveniently sized, admirably printed volumes,
illustrated with many steel engravings. A little soon, perhaps, to talk
of Christmas presents. But if there be any amiable uncle or fairy god-
mother kept awake o' nights wondering what they shall give for
Christmas box to Dick, Tom or Harry, here 's the very thing for him,
her and them. The volumes comprise a library in themselves, and
their study is a liberal education. Since the world began there is no
human life that possesses for humanity an interest keener or more
abiding than that of NAPOLEON. Sometimes for a while it seems to
sleep, only to awaken with freshened vigour. The NAPOLEON cult is
one of the most prominent features of to-day. The Presses of Paris,
London and New York teem with new volumes of reminiscences,
letters or diaries, all about NAPOLEON. THIERS' massive work has
stood the test of time and will ever remain a classic. To us who read
it to-day it has the added interest of its author's personality, and the
sad labour of his closing years. It is pretty to note how THIERS,
writing before the creation of the Third Empire, for which this book
did much to pave the way, shrinks from mentioning Waterloo. For
him it is_" the battle after the day of Ligny and Quatre Bras." We
are well into his detailed account of the great fight before we re-
cognise the plains of Waterloo. THIERS does not disguise his effort
to extol the Prussians at the expense of the English. It was BLUCHEB.
not WELLINGTON, who won the fight the Prussians call the Battle of
La Belle Alliance, NAPOLEON the Battle of Mont St. Jean, and
the presumptuous English Waterloo. The patriotic and therefore
irascible Frenchman little thought the day would dawn on France
when it would learn of a battle more calamitous even than Waterloo.
Still less did he perpend that he himself would make the personal
acquaintance of the Prussians in circumstances analogous to those
amid which, on a July day in 1815, three plenipotentiaries set forth
from Paris to meet the foreign invaders, and sue for terms that
should, as far as possible, lessen the humiliation of the occupation
of the French capital.
I confess I am disappointed with ANTHONY HOPE'S The God in the
Car. Some of the dialogue is in his very best'' Dolly " comedy-vein.
The last interview between hero and heroine is admirably written.
But it is not "in it" with his most originally conceived story of
The Prisoner of Zenda. The title requires explanation, and you
don't get the explanation until the climax, which explanation is
as unsatisfactory as the title. "The hazy finish is, quoth the
Baron, "to my thinking, artistic." "What becomes of the lady?
what becomes of the lover?" are questions the regular romance-
reader will put. And the replyis evidently the old one, on which
no improvement is possible, Whatever you please my little dear,
you pays vpur money and you takes your choice." But it is well
worth reading, and our friend "the Skipper," who "knows the
ropes," will find there are some, though not very frequent, oppor-
tunities for his mental gymnastic exercise.
THE BARON DE BOOK-WORMS.
AN EPICURE TO HIS LOVE.
MY Queen, Mayonnaise! Oh, give ear to thy lover—
Oh, pity his passion, my sweet Mayonnaise!
Just one glance from those eyes which (like eggs of the plover!)
Can kill—(or be cooked)—in a hundred of ways!
When first I beheld thee my thoughts
flew unbidden
To dishes I'd eaten—so fair to the eye.
That I 've looked and I 've looked till
the flavour they 've hidden
Was forgot at the sight of the dish,
or the pie.

Oh, grant that our loves, like potage a
la creme,
Flow gently and smoothly along
through the days.
(To me it's the same, for though
MABEL 'g thy name,
To me thou art ever my sweet " Mayonnaise.")
White as tnow are thy teeth that, like rt; a fAnglaise,
Shine forth between lips red as satire fcrerisse:
And the truffle-like beauty-spot nestles and says,
"Come and kiss next the dimple and taste, dear, of bliss!"
Dinde de JBresse is not plumper nor fairer than thee;
And thy gown and its trimmings thy beauties enhance.
None so sweet in the country of Gruyere and Brie,
Where St. Sauce counts for more than St. Louis of France.
Nay, turn not your head. Never blush porltigaise,
Be tender as chaufroid of veal d la rente—
(A dish for the gods!—not what Englishmen praise,
Indigestible veal qiti ne " reatt" pas la pain!)
Hot as sauce remoulade though thy temper may be—
Though caprice gall thy thoughts till thy brain's panaclte—
I '11 love thee and love thee—I swear it by THEE '—
The roast thou shall rule, by night and by day!
Mv Queen, Mayonnaise, oh give ear to my prayer!
Be my love—be my wife! Come, Mayonnaise dear,
And to Paris we'll fly, and at BIQNON'S we '11 fare,
And the evening we'll spend at the -Jfem/s-Plaisirs!
Though TORTONI 's no more, we mav still taste of joy,
For I wot of a house where a goddess might eat—
Where the palate's not worried, the dishes don't cloy,
Where to eat is to live, and to drink is a treat!
Behold, Mayonnaise, I 'm the slave of thy wishes -
A lover devoted who cannot do less
Than to set on thy table the daintiest dishes;
So the man thou mayst love, while the cook thou dost bless

A CLERICAL QUESTION
FOR EXETER.
THE Special Correspondent
"doing" the Church Congress
at Exeterforthe Morning Post,
when remarking on the clerical
cost umes in the procession to the
Cathedral, told us that among
the "college caps " i.e. " mor-
tar-boards," (which of course
go with the university gown
or clerical surplice,) and
"birettas," (which, being
Italian, are not certainly part
of English academical or
ecclesiastical costume,) there
appeared a "tall hat," «'.«.
the topper of private life,
which, as it happens, i< part
of the Academical Master
of Arts costume, and there-
fore, though unbecoming in a
procession of mortar-boards
and birettas, is yet unassail-
able from a purely academic
and Cantabrigian pointof view.
It may not be " Oxonian," by
the way; but if the wearer
were an Oxford man he would
know beat. Now, if thehat.pre-
sumablv black.had been a white
one? White is 1he surplice:
whv not the hat? White is the
emblem of purity, although,
sad to say, when associated
with a hat, it used at one time
to be provocative of an inquiry
as to the honesty of the wearer
in regard to the surreptitious
possesion of a donkey. Has
anybody anywhere ever seen
a parson, whether M.A. or
not, in a white hat? Surely
such a phenomenon must rank
with the defunct postboy and
dead donkey. This will be
one of the inquiries to which
clerical costume at ecclesiasti-
cal Exeter must naturally give
rise. Perhaps the top-hatted
clergyman was a Freemason,
wearing this as emblematic of
a " tiled lodge."

IN THE WILDS OF THE NORTH.
Hungry Saxon (jutt arrived,'with fqually hungry family). "WELL, NOW—
ER—WHAT CAN YOU GIVE US FOR DINNER, A8 SOON AS WE "VE HAD A
WASH?" Scotch Lassie: "Ou, JIST ONYTHINO I"
H. S. (rubbing his hands in anticipation). "AH! Now WE 'LL HAVE A
NICE JUICY STBAK."
Lassie. "A—WEEL. WE 'LL BE HAEIN' SOME STEAK HERE MAYBE BY
THK BOAT i' THE MORN'S MORN I"
H. S. (a, little crest/alien). "OH—WELL—CHOPS THEN. WE'LL SAY
MOTTO.V Cnors."
Lassie. "On, AY, BUT WE'VE NO BEEN KILLIN' A SHEEP THE DAY!"
[Ends up with bailed eggs, and rows to remain at home for the future.
"ALL UP WITH THE
EMPIRE!"
THIS is a dreadful cry to
raise. Let's hope it is not
anywhere near the truth.
Says the Emperor, i.e. the
chairman of the Empire
(Theatre), "There will beonly
one effect should the County
Council endorse the decision
of its Licensing Committee.
The Empire Theatre will be at
once closed, as it would be im-
posfrible to carry it on under
such absurd restrictions."
Such is the Imperial ukase
issuing from Leicester Square.
And the Emperor is right.
This "grandmotherly legis-
lation," however well-inten-
tioned the grandmothers, may
be all very well for "babes
and sucklings," but then
babies in arms are not ad-
mitted to the Empire, and
those babes of older growth
who have evidently been par-
taking too freelv of "the
bottle" are strictly excluded
hy the I. C. 0. or Imperial
Cnuokers Out. No doubt
London common sense will
ultimately prevail, even in the
Court of the London County
Council, and the Empire wifl
soon be going stronger than
ever.
MOTLEY REFLECTION.—
What better name for an his-
torian than " MOTLEY " t Not
in the buffoonic sense of the
term; not when, to change
the spelling, "Motley is your
only ware"; but as imply-
ing a variety of talents as
equal as the patches in the
perfect dress of a harlequin.
Of course the pen is the wand.
What transformations cannot
the Motley historian bring
about! A monster becomes a
man, and a man a monster.

At the golden-nng'd chap,
Which buzzed and which bummed,
And circled and hummed
Round the head of that little Chinee.

"Um hurt me, nm did,

MpDEBif MASOERS.—Nearly all hotel ad-
vertisements prominently announce as among
the principal attractions of each establish-
ment " separate tables." It looks as if the
"all-together-faWe-rrAute-system" had failed
by reason of "incompatibility of temper."
Hence the divorce a mensa. The long table
with all the noses in a row down in the feeding-
trough is by this time a remnant of barbarism.
Yet the " boxes " common to the old eating-
houses, such for example, as may still be
seen in some parts of London both east and
west, were "pernicious snug "and sufficiently
private, too, for business conversation and
confidential communications.

Mrs. Chatt. I'd no idea you would

a perfect horror of gossip! It took me
so much by surprise, that I simply
couldn't resist; but I can easily tell
Captain THICKNESSE it was all a mistake;
he knows how fearfully inaccurate I
always am.
Lady Maisie. I would rather you
said nothing more about it, please; it is
really not worth while contradicting
anything so utterly absurd. (To her-
self.) That GERALD—Captain THICK-
NESSE—of all people, should know of my
letter! And goodness only knows what

Lady Culv. (in distress). Really, my dear VIVIEH, I — I don't know

think so, ROHESIA?
Lady Cant. Probably they would, ALBINIA.
It is most unlikely
that they would care to hear anything more intellectual and
instructive than the sound of their own voices.
Miss Spelw. I told Lady LTTLLINGTOIC that I was afraid you would
think it a bore, Lady CANTIRE.
Lady Cant. You are perfectly mistaken, Miss SPELWANE. I
flatter myself I am quite as capable of appreciating a literary
privilege as anyb. ily here. But I cannot answer for its being
acceptable to the majority.
Lady Culv. No, it wouldn't do at all. And it would be making
this young man so much too conspicuous.

fortunate enough to secure a celebrity at Wyvern, you can't make

In tracking down celebrities is undiminiehed still.
We 're quick enough to mark our prey, we scent him at a distance,
But seldom is our watchfulness rewarded by a " kill."
There are bears indeed in plenty, there are owls with strident voices,
And jackanapes in modern days are seldom hard to find,
But the genuine British Lion, in whom our heart rejoices.
Seems almost to have vanished from the dwellings of mankind!
And even if we find him, after herculean labour.
Apart from festive drawing-rooms he resolutely roams,
Disgracefully forgetful of his duty to his neighbour
He quite declines to dignify our dinners and At Homes
Too often those we ask are unaccountably prevented
From hastening, as we wanted them, "to come and join the

And so, in these degraded times, we have to be contented
With quite inferior persons, mediocrities who "prance."
Yes, "prancing mediocrity"—sweet phrase!—no doubt expresses
The decadent young poet, with the limp and languid air,
The very last pianist with the too-abundant tresses.
Whose playing is—well, only less eccenlric than his hair.

THE BLUE GARDENIA.
[(A Colourable Imitation,)
II [was a splendid* scarlet afternoon, and the little garden'looked
its gayest in the midsummer sunshine which streamed down its tiny
paths. Yellow asters grew golden in the pale lemon light, whilst
the green carnations which abounded everywhere seemed so natural
that it was difficult to believe they had been
wired on to the plants that morning by a
London firm of florists. That was a plan on
which CECIL PARAGRAPH always insisted. As
he was so fond of saying, Nature was a dear
old ithing, but she lacked inventiveness. It
'"~\ was only an outworn convention which ob-
\v jected to gilding the lily, or colouring the
/ carnation. So the London florists always came
• I each morning to convert the garden into a
'pink rhapsody.
Lord ARCHIE (he was not a Lord really, but
CECIL always insisted that a title was a
matter of temperament) and CECIL were sitting out on the lawn.
Clever conversation always takes place on the lawn. CECIL and
Lord ARCHIE smoked high-priced cigarettes. The witty characters
always do.
"My dear ARCHIE," said CECIL, "I have something important to
tell you."
"If you were not CECIL PARAGRAPH, that would mean that the
milkman had called to have his account paid, or that MART—or is it
MARTHA ?—had given notice. It's like letters headed' Important,'—
a prospectus of a gold mine, or a letter from a distant relative to say
he's coming to stay the week-end. Saying 'week-end' always re-
minds me of the BARON DE BOOK-WORMS. I fancy myself haggling
for a cheap ticket at a booking-office."
"ARCHIE, you 've prattled enough. Remember it is I who am
expected to fill the bill. ARCHIE. I am writing a book."
'' A book? You will let me collaborate with you?"
"Collaboration is the modem method of evading responsibility.
A genius moves in a cycle of masterpieces, but it is never a cycle
made for two. It reminds me of the book by Mr. RIDER HAGGARD
and Mr. LANG. Too late Mr. HAGGARD found that he had killed the
goose which laid the golden eggs. He had lost the notices which his
collaborator could no longer write."
"But it is so much trouble to write a book. Would not a purple
newspaper article effect your purpose?"
"One would think I was Mr. ATHELSTAN RILEY, or the Independ-
ent Labour Party, to hear you talk of effecting my purpose. But
in any case the book's the thing."
"Tell me, CECIL, tell me about your book," said Lord ARCHIE,
with the ardour of a disciple of CECIL s.
"It will be called The Blue Gardenia. The title is one of the
unemployed; it has nothing to do with the
story.
_" I fancy I remember that Mr. BARRY PAIN
said that once before."
"No doubt. The clumsiness of acknowledg-
ment is what makes the artist into an artisan. I
am like Mr. BALFOCR, I do not hesitate'to shoot
—into my treasury the pearls of speech I have
gathered from others, and then, ARCHIE, I shall
not lack the art of personal allusion. If my
characters go out into the village and see the vil-
lage clergymen, I shall make him the Archbishop
of CANTERBURY. People like it. They say it's
rude, but they read the book and repeat the
rudeness. I shall be frankly rude. Minor poets
and authors and actors will all be fair game.
You suggest the publisher may object. To tell
you the truth, ANY MAN will publish for me.
The book will succeed—it is only mediocrities
who indulge in failure—and the public will
tumble over one another in their mad rush to be dosed with
epigrams of genius."
"And I will write a flaming favourable notice in the Dodo."
"You will do me no such unkindness, I am sure, my dear ARCHLB.
To be appreciated is to be found out."
And so plucking as they went the green carnations of a blameless
life, they went in to dinner.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A PIER OF THE EMPIRE.
(By a Commoner of the Nation.)
As licensing day was approaching, I thought it my duty to visit th<
Empire Theatre oi Varieties in Leicester Square, so that if needs be 1
could appear as a witness either for the prosecution or the defence
I am happy to say that my expedition has put me in a position to join
the garrison. From first to last—from item No. 1 to item No. 10 —
the entertainments atj the Empire are excellent. And in thi
general praise I am able to include " Living
Pictures" which are all that even an
nrehbishop could wish that they should be
But the chief attraction of the evening is
a new ballet dirertissement in one tableau
called On Brighton Pier, which has
evidently been put up to teach the members
of the L. C. 0. how much better things are
done in the Sussex watering place than in
the great metropolis. According to "the
Argument," when the scene opens, people
are promenading in the sun, and '' some
gentlemen bribe the bath chairmen to give
up their places in the evening so that they
may flirt with the girls accompanying the
invalids." But possibly as an afterthought
this was thought a little too strong for the
Censor of Spring Gardens. I found the
"gentlemen (most of them in high white
hats), and then I discovered the bath chair-
men, but there was nothing to lead me to
believe that the connecting links between
the two were bribery and corruption. In
addition to this flat a la Don Giovanni there were an entree in the
shape of a gathering of schoolboys and schoolgirls, a sotifflf in some
military plus naval drill, and a piece de resistance in a change oi
scene from the deck of the Pier to the depths of the sea beneath it.
And here let me say that I use resistance in a purely culinary sense,
as nothing could have worked more smoothly than the trans-formal ion.
Madame KATTI LAXNEK, by whom the ballet has been invented, is
a past mistress in the art of concocting terpsichorean trifles, and never
admits any difficulty in combining the poetry of fancy with the
actuality of fact. In her latest production she finds that after a while
a change of scene is necessary. The public, after admiring the re-
freshment stalls and the distant view of the Grand Hotel, want some-
thing more. Certainly, why not!* The daughter of an American
millionaire, who has met a rather effeminate 'gentleman for the first
time, overcome by the heat, falls asleep. Then, to quote from "the
Argument," in her dream she sees sirens and sea-nymphs, led by the
Queen Coralie (Signorina BICE POBKO) , unsuccessfully attempt to lure
away her lover, but—awaking from her sleep—the vision disappears,
and she finds him at her feet. All this was very pretty, and the
scruples of the L. C. C. were considered by the lack of success of
Queen Coralie to shake the swain's fidelity to his betrothed.
Although evidently interested in the dances of the sirens and sea-
nymphs—in spite of their treating him with little or no attention—he
was ultra discreet in making the acquaintance of her submarine
majesty. When the Queen stood on one toe he merely accepted her
invitation to hold her hand, and thus enable her to revolve on the
tip of her right toe-^but went no further. And reallv and truly, as
a gentleman, it was impossible for him to do less. At any rate his
conduct was so unexceptional in Grace Dollar's dream, that his
fiancee, who. according to "the Argument," had had "a slight
quarrel with him," immediately sought reconciliation. Besides the
submarine interlude, On Brighton Pier has a serious underplot.
Senora Dolores (Signorina CAVALLAZZI), who has been searching all
over the world for her daughter, who had been stolen from her ten
years ago, is personally conducted to the pleasant promenade off the
beach. Husband and wife seemingly spend
the entire day on the Pier. They are here
in the morning, in the sunshine, and here
when the variegated lamps are lighted at
night. The Senora is pleased at nothing.
She regards the vagaries of a negro comedian
with indifference, and does not even smile at
the gambols of a clown dog. Suddenly a
girl called Dora appears. And now once
more to quote the Argument. "Dora plays
upon her mandoline some melody the Senora
Dolores recognises. She quickly asks the
girl where she first heard it: and Dora says
that a lady used to sing it to her in her
early days, and that the same lady gave her
a cross, which she produces. The Senora, by
means of the cross, recognises in Dora her long-lost child. Amid

*'1 can conscientiously

Hotel Metropole], and, after some further dances, the curtain falls."
Nothing can be prettier, and more truly moral, than On Brighton
Pier. I can conscientiously recommend it to every member of
the L. C. C.; some will smile at the eccentric dance of Major
Spooner (Mr. WILL BISHOP); others will grin at the more boisterous
humour of Christopher Dollar (Mr. JOHN RIDLEY); and all must
weep at the depressed velvet coat of Don Diego (Mr. GEOKGB
ASHTON), the husband of Senora Dolores, in search of a (compara-
tively) long-lost daughter. Judging from the reception the ballet
received the other evening, I fancy that On Brighton Pier will
remain on London boards for any length of time.

GOSSIP WITHOUT WORDS.
[" AUTOLYCVS," in the Pall if all Gazette of October 11, inveighs agninst
the necessity of conversation between friends:—" If I find a girl nice to look
at, nnd she has taken great pnins to make herself nice to look at, why cannot
we pass the evening, I looking at her, and she being lookedfit? But no, we
must talk."]
UNDOUBTEDLY, if conversation were abolished, " short stories " in
the future would be still further abbreviated. Here is a beautiful
specimen of blank—or Anthony Hope-less—dialogue:—
THE NELLY NOVELETTES.
"!" exclaimed Miss NKLLY EATON, suddenly, with her quivering
nostril.
"?" I asked with my right eyebrow,
rousing myself from a fit of abstraction.
She printed, at a young man who had just
strolled past onr seats in the Row without
noticing her. He was dressed in the height
of fashion, and was accompanied by a lady
in very smart attire.
". . ." explained NELLY, with her mouth
tightly shut.
I looked at her, and gathered by a swift
process of intuition that she had made that
boy, and taught him to drink and smoke—
of course, in moderation; had got his hair
cut, and had rescued him from an adven- "Taught him to unoke."
tnress. From her he had learnt not to go to Monday Pops, nor to
carry things about in brown paper—in fact, he owed everything to
her . . . And now!
"§" I visibly commented, not knowing for the moment how else
to express myself. In fact I was getting just a trifl« out of my
depth. However, I gazed again at her. . . . Yes, she had deeply
eloquent blue eyes, fringed with dark eyelashes, that voiced forth
every emotion! Stay, 1 am afraid that in my admiration my speech-
less remarks had wandered from the topic of our mute discussion.
"t " interjected her pitying but impatient glance, telling me that
mv devotion was useless.
I looked very miserable. It is generally understood that I am the
most miserable of men since Miss EATON'S engagement to an American
millionaire.
[Here I am sorry to sav that our dialogue becomes somewhat ellip-
tical, owing to the difficulty of finding enough unappropriated
printers' symbols to represent our different shades of silence. How-
ever, with luck, I may be able to scrape together a few more, and
come to some sort of conclusion.]
Let me see—where were we f ... Oh, on the subject of the
boy and bis companion, who, it seems, were engaged.
"• • • " resumed NELLY, in a look which spoke three volumes. I
divined at once that she had thrown him over, that there had been
an awful scene, and his mother had written a horrid letter, that he
had come back and abjectly apologised, that he said she had destroyed
his faith in women (the usual thing), that he
went on sending letters for a whole year: in
fact, that it made her quite uncomfortable.
. . . Really, XKI.LY can give points to LOED
BCBLEIGH'S nod!
"?" inquired my right eye, meaning, had
she not been in love with him a little bit'?
Miss NELLY prodded the path with her
parasol.
l " I asked again, referring to a different
person, and, I am afraid, squinting.
Miss NELLY looked for the fraction of an
nstant in my direction.
"i i " I repeated.
Miss NELLY looked straight in front of her. There was her fiance,
;he American millionaire!
"!!" That is, I smilingly withdrew.

A thing that painters often do;
Still, though your charms have left me cold,
At least you are not fat and old!
Why should you, flower-sellers, then,
Be so advanced in age and size?
You cannot charm the foreign men,
Who gaze at you in blank surprise.
You hover round me—like a gDaf,
Each of you, but old and fat.
Extremely troublesome you are,
No gnats were ever half so bad,
You dart upon me from afar,
And do your best to drive me mad.
Oh bother yon, so overbold.
Preposterously fat and old!
You buttonhole me as I drink
My cajfe nero on the square,
Stick flowers in my coat, and think
I can't refuse them. I don't care.
I'd buy them, just to have a chat,
If you were not so old and fat.
Oh go away! I hate the sight
Of flowers since that afternoon
When first we met. I think of flight,
Or drowning in the still lagoon.
I am, unlike your flowers, sold,
You are so very fat and old.

That the years at last have power?
That life's foliage and its flower

From its shelf, by chance, a bock
Penned by you,
But was fast your friend, for life,
With one refuge from its strife
Safe and true?

With a soul of kindred sort,
Who could bind strong sense and sport
In one sheaf.

Of keen wits the most humane,
Wide yet clear,

Giving sense and sentiment
With a manly breadth of soul,
And a fancy quaint and droll;
Ripe and mellow:
With a virile power of "hit,"
Finished scholar, poet, wit,
And good fellow!
Sturdy patriot, and yet
True world's citizen! Regret
Dims our eyes
As we turn each well-thumbed leaf;
Yet a glory 'midst our grief
Will arise.
Years your spirit could not tame,
And they wiU not dim your fame;

Oh, girls of Venice! WOODS, R.A.,

A thing that painters often do;
Still, though your charms have left me cold,
At least you are not fat and old!
Why should you. flower-sellers, then,
Be so advanced in age and size?
You cannot charm the foreign men,
Who gaze at you in blank surprise.
You hover round me—like a gnaf,
Each of you, but old and fat.
Extremely troublesome you are,
No gnats were ever half so bad,
You dart upon me from afar,
And do your best to drive me mad.
Oh bother you, so overbold.
Preposterously fat and old!
You buttonhole me as I drink
My caffe nero on the square,
Stick flowers in my coat, and think
I can't refuse them. I don't care.
I 'd buy them, just to have a chat,
If you were not so old and fat.
Oh go away! I hate the sight
Of flowers since that afternoon
When first we met. I think of flight,
Or drowning in the still lagoon.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS.
THERE is no doubt that one's first impres-
sions are always the brightest and the best;
therefore I resolve to record the first impres-
sions of a first visit to the Italian lakes.
British Hellagio.—"Hotel Victoria,Prince
de Galles et des lies Britanniques," or some
such name, is usually, as Baedeker says,
"frequented by the English." They are here
certainly, and one hears one's native lan-
guage everywhere. There are the honey-
moon couples,
silent and re-
served, who glare
fiercely at anyone
who might be
supposed to im-
agine for a mo-
ment that they
are newly mar-
ried: there are
people who con-
verse in low mo-
notonous voices
about the wea-
t h e r, which
changes every
hour; there is an
old lady, who
gives one startling iuformation, telling one,
for instance, that PAUL VERONESE was born
at Verona; and there are two or three British
menservants, gazing with superb disdain at
the poor foreigners. The hotel is very quiet.
The evening of a week-day is like Sunday
evening, and Sunday evening is !!! If
only the weather were not also English, or
even worse. On the last day of September
the only warm place is by the fire in the
famoir. So let us hurry off from this wintry
climate to somewhere, to anywhere. By the
first boat we go.
Still English everywhere. At Bellagio a
great crowd, and heaps of luggage. At
Cadenabbia a greater crowd, and more heaps
of luggage. Here they come, struggling
along the gangway in the wind. There is a
sad-faced Englishman, his hands full of
packages, his pockets stuffed with others,
carrying under his arm a little old picture
wrapped loosely in pink tissue paper, which
the wind blows here and there. He is a for-
getful man, for he wanders to and fro collect-
ing his possessions. With him is another
forgetful Englishman in very shabby clothes,
who also carries packages in paper, and who
drags after him an immensely fat bull-dog at
the end of a cord five yards long, which
winds round posts and human legs and other
obstacles. At last they are all on board—the
forgetful Englishmen have darted back for
the last time to fetch in an ice-axe and an
old umbrella—and on we go over the grey
water, past the grey hills, under the grey
sky, towards Como. At Cernobbio the shabby
Englishman lands, dragging his bull-dog at
the end of the cord, and carrying in his
arms two rolls of rugs, a bag, and other
trifles. His sad-faced companion, still hold-
ing his tiny Old Master in the ever-diminish-
ing pink paper, wanders in and out seeking
forgotten treasures, an ice-axe, a bag, another
paper parcel. Finally all are landed, the
gangway is withdrawn, the steamer begins to
move. Suddenly there is a shout. The shabby
Englishman has forgotten something. The
sympathetic passengers look round. There is
a solitary umbrella on a seat. No doubt
that is his. A friendly stranger cries, " Is
this yours '*" and tosses it to him on the
quay. Then there is another shout. "Ach
Himmel. dat is mine!" The frantic German
waves his arms, the umbrella is tossed back,
he catches it and is happy. But meanwhile
that ever lived, has discovered yet another
solitary umbrella, which he oasts wildly into
space. For one moment the captain, the pas-
sengers, the people on the quay, gaze breath-
less as it whirls through the air. It falls
just short of the landing-stage, and sinks into
the grey waters of that chilly lake, never
more to be recovered, in any sense of the
word. In those immeasurable depths its neat
silk covering will decay, its slender frame
will fall to pieces. It has gone for ever. Be-
neath this grey Italian sky some Italian gamp
must keep off these Italian showers. Then the
captain, the passengers, and the people smile
and laugh. I, who write this, am the only
one on whose face there is not a grin, for
that umbrella was mine.
A FIRST IMPRESSIONIST.
TO A PRETTY UNKNOWN.
(By a Constant Admirer.)
YOTTB pretty face I saw
two years ago,
You looked divine—if
I 'm not wrong, in
lace.
I noticed you, and thus
I got to know
Your pretty face.
To-day I travelled to a
distant place.
We stopped at Bath.
I read my Punch,
when lo!
You came into my car-
riage and Your
Grace
Rode with me for a
dozen miles or so.
Tell me, should we in
this Fate's finger
_. trace?
I care not bince you had the heart to show
Your pretty face.

TEDDIE THE TILER.
'Tis November makes the (Lord) Mayor
to go. As the ninth approaches, the year's
tenant of the Mansion House packs up and
says farewell to all his greatness. On the
pnnciple that attributes happiness to acountry
that has no annals, the outgoing LOBD MATOE
is to be congratulated on his year of office. It
is probable that out of aldermanic circles not
one man of a hundred in the street could
straight off say what is his Lordship's name.
Mr. Punch, who knows most things, only
ventures to believe that the good alderman is
known in the family circle as Sir EDWARD
TYLER. And a very good name, too. In the

occult ceremonies pertaining to freemasonry
it is understood there is an official known as
the Tiler, whose duty is to guard the door,
strictly excluding all but those whose right
of entrance is peremptory. Our Sir EDWARD
has indeed been the Tiler of the traditionally
BROKEN CHINA.
IT is curious to observe the attitude of
Western Powers towards the life-and-death
struggle going on in the far East. We of
course regret the loss of life, but are mainly

interested in observing the effect in actual
work of ships and guns identical with our
own. It is a sort of gigantic test got up for
our benefit at somebody else's expense. That
an ancient empire seems tottering to a fall
moves no emotion. "Yes," said the Mem-
ber for SABK, to whom these recondite re-
marks were addressed; "POPE wasn't far out
of it when he very nearly said 'Europe is
mistress of herself though China fall.'"
"MOVING ABOUT IN WORLDS NOT
REALISED."
(By a prejudiced but puzzled Victim of Tea-
caddies and Ginger-jars.)
I SUPPOSE there's a war in the East,
(I am deluged with pictures about it,)
But I can't realise it—no, not in the least,
And, in spite of the papers, I doubt it.
A Chinaman seems such a nebulous chap,
And I can't fancy shedding the gore of a
Jap.
Those parehmenty fellows have fleets?
Big Iron-clads, each worth a million?
I cannot conceive it, my reason it beats.
The lord of the pencfl vermilion
Fits in with a teacaddy, not a torpedo.
Just picture a Ram in that queer bay of
Yedo!
It seems the right place for a junk,
(With a fine flight of storks in the offing),
Bat think of a battle-ship there being sunk
By a Krupp! 'Tis suggestive of scoffing.
I try to believe, but 'tis merely bravado.
It all seems as funny as GILBERT'S Mikado.
And then those preposterous names,
Like a lot of cracked bells all a-tinkling!
I try to imagine their militant games,
But at present I can't get an inkling
Of what it can mean when a fellow named
HONG
And one TING (Lord High Admiral!) go it
ding-dong!
A NELSON whose nomen is WHAXG
To me, I admit's. inconceivable.
And war between Wo-HuNG and CHIXG-A-
RINU CHANG,
Sounds funny, but quite unbelievable.
And can you conceive Maxim bulleta a-sing
Round a saffron-hued hero called PONG, or
PlNG-WlNG?
A ship called Kow-Shing, I am sure,
Can be only a warship pour rire.
And Count YAMAGATA—he must be a cure!
No, no, friends, I very much fear
That in spite of the pictures, and portraits,
and maps,
another English man, the most egregious ass
I can't make live heroes of Johnnies and Japs!
hospitable Mansion House.

LETTERS FROM A DEBUTANTE.
MY DEAR MARJ OKIE,—You remember CECIL CASHMOREP Of
course no theatricals could be a success unless he took the entire
management. He is a celebrated private performer, and his name is
frequently seen in " Amateur Dramatic Notes," where he is freely
compared to COQTTKLIN, ARTHUR ROBERTS, IRVING, and CHARLES
KEAN, in his earlier manner—I mean CHARLES KEANE'S earlier
manner, not CECIL'S. He always greets me with, "Oh, I'm so
afraid of you. I believe you 're very cross with me"; and his
parting words are invariably " ffoorf-bye; I'm coming to see you
to soon!" CISSY—everyone calls him CISSY—seems to be a little
particular, not to say fidgetty.
BABY BEAUMONT heard him say to his valet, "Take away that
eau-de-cologne—it's corked." He seems to think himself ill, though
he looks blooming; and says he has neurasthenia. He's always
going through some " course," or " treatment." One hears him cry-
to the footman who hands him a forbidden dish, "Good Heavens,
mydear man, don't offer me that—I 'm under JOWLES!"
We wanted to act The School for Scandal, but CISSY has per-
suaded us to get up a burlesque of bis own—Red Hiding Hood. I
am to be Red Riding Hood.'!! I am de-
lighted. I have never acted before; but
they say I have only to trip on with a
basket. BABY declared he would be a Proud
Sister. In vain he was told there were no
Proud Sisters in Red Riding Hood; he
seemed to have set his heart on it so much
that CISSY has written one in for him. Now
BABY is happy, designing himself a gor-
geous frock, and passing hours in front of
a looking-glass, trying various patterns
against his complexion. All the strength
of the piece falls upon CISSY, who plays
the Wolf, and has given himself any
amount of songs and dances, lots of "serious
interest," and all the "comic relief." He
says it's not an ordinary burlesque, but a
mixture of a problem play and a comic opera.
Captain MASHIN<;TON is to play the Mother,
so I see a good deal of him. (The LOBNE
HOPPERS are in Scotland). We had had
sixteen rehearsals when LADY_ TAYSIER
suddenly horrified us by saying it seemed
so much trouble—why not give it up, and
if we wanted a little fun, black our faces
and pretend to be niggers!! Of course,
we would not listen to her. I hear Captain
MASJIINGTON rehearsing his part every morning, quietly, in the
billiard-room. He never can remember the lines
"Good bye, my dear, now mind you 're very good,
Aud shun the dangers lurking in the wood."
He thinks the mother ought to kiss Red Riding Hood before she
starts, /think not. We asked CISSY. He says it's optional. ...
SISSY rose with the owl to-day, and said he was not well. A little
later he came and told us complacently that he had been looking it
up in the Encyclopedia, and found he had " every symptom of acute
lead-poisoning." He added that there was nothing to be done.
"I thought there was something wrong with you yesterday," said
BABY. "You declined all nourishment between lunch and tea."
"By the way," said CISSY, pretending not to hear, "MASIUNGTON
really is not quite light enough for the Mother. You should per-
suade him to go through a course. Miss GLADYS."
"He's just been through a course," I eaid, "at Hythe."
"My dear lady, I don't mean musketry. He ought to consult
CASTLE JONES, the specialist. No soup, no bread, no potatoes-
saccharine. What are you allowed?" turning to BABY, who was
sitting on a window seat eating marrons-glacts out of a paper-bag.
This sight seemed to infuriate our manager. He made a wild dart
at BABY, saying, "Oh, look at this; it's fatal, positively fatal!"
Mint r!n (1 violently at the bag, secured a chestnut, and calmly walked
out of the room eating it and saying it was delicious.
1 had just come home from a very nice drive with JACK—I mean
Captain MASHIXGTON—when I found a letter from ORIEL. He says
lie is engaged to Miss TOOCOOD. The matter is to be kept a profound
secret for the present. . . . He asks me, for the sake of the past, to
try and get him a stamp of the Straits Settlements, in exchange
Eor a Mauritian. . . . She collects stamps too—it must have been the
bond of union. . . . How fickle men are! It 'fl enough to disgust
one with human nature. I know I broke it off, but still
Ever your loving friead, GLADYS.
I wonder if Miss TOOGOOD will have a bangle. I thould like to
advise her not to have it riretted on. It's such a bother getting
them filed off.

Spurr. I'm in evening dress, EMMA, such as it is (not that I 'ye

Spurr. I don't say it does, in

did the trick, EMMA.
Phill. Andromeda f Thev were

Spurr. Scribbling? how do you

something to distinguish yourself.
Spurr. Well. I don't say I mayn't have got a certain amount of
what they call "kudos," owing to Andromeda. But what difference
does that make?
Phill. Tell me, JAMES, is it you that's been writing a pink book

EMMA, you don't suppose I've quite come to that! Andromeda's

portraits of both of us in one of the papers. And the people here
were very much taken with the dog, and—and so they aslced me
to dine with them. That's how it was.
Phill. I should have thought, if they asked one of you to dine, it

Spurr. I assure you I didn't go a step beyond the most ordinary
civility. You 're not going to be jealous because I promised I 'd give
her a liniment for one of her dogs, are you?
Phill. Liniment! You always were a flirt, JAMES! But I 'm not
jealous. I 've met a very nice-spoken young man while I've been
here; he sat next to me at supper, and paid me the most beautiful
compliments, and was most polite and attentive—though he hasn't
got as far as liniment, at present.
Spurr. But, EUMA, you 're not going to take up with some other
fellow just when we 've come together again?
Phill. If you call it "coming together," when I 'm down in the
Housekeeper s Room, and you 're up above, carrying on with ladies
of title!
Spun: Do you want to drive me frantic? As if I could help
being where I am! How could I know you were here?
Phill. At all events you know now, JAMES. And it's for you to
choose between your smart lady-
friends and me. If you 're fit com-
pany for them, you 're too grand
for one of their maids.
Spurr. My dear girl, don't be
unreasonable I I 'm expected back
in the Drawing Room, and I can't
throw 'em over now all of a sudden
without giving offence. There 's
the interests of the firm to con-
sider, and it's not for me to take a
lower place than I 'm given. But
it's only for a night or two, and
you don t really suppose I wouldn't
rather be where you are if I was
free to choose—but I 'm not, EMMA,
that's the worst of it!
Phill. Well, go back to the Draw-
ing Room, then; don't keep Lady
KIMIHA waiting for her liniment
on my account. I ought to be in
my ladies' rooms by this time.
Only don't be surprised if, whenever
you are free to choose, yon find
you've come back just too late—
that's all! [She turns to leave him.
Spurr. (detaining her). EMMA. I
won't let you go like this! Not
before you 've told me where I can
meet you again here.
Ph'ill. There's no place that I
know of—except the Housekeeper's
Room; and of course you couldn't
descend so low as that. . . . JAMI:S,
there's somebody coming! Let go
my hand—do you want to lose me
my character!
[Slept and voices are heard at
the other end of the passage;
she frees herself, and escapes.
Spun: (attempting to follow).
But, EMMA, stop one-;— She 's
gone! . . . Confound it, there 's
the butler and a page-boy coming! It's no use staying up here
any longer. (To himself, as he goes downstairs.) It's downright
torture—that s what it is! To be tied by the leg in the Drawing -
Room, doing the civil to a lot of girls I don't care a blow about;
and to know that all the time some blarneying beggar downstairs
is doing his best to rob me of my EMM\! Flesh and blood can't
stand it; and vet I 'm blest if I see any way out of it without
offending 'em all round. [ffe enters the Chinese Drawing-Room.
SCENE XXVII.—The Chinese Drawing Room.
J/i'ss Spclieane. At last, Mr. SPITRRELL! We began to think you
meant to keep away altogether. Has anybody told you trhy you 've

Spurr. (looking round the circle of chairs apprehensively). No. Is
it family prayers, or what P Er- are they over?

read aloud to us. Are you really cruel enough to refuse?
Spurr. Read aloud! Is that what you want me to do? Bui
I "m no particular hand at it. I don't know that I 've ever read
aloud—except a bit out of the paper "now and then—since I was a
hoy at school!
Lady C'anttre. What's that I hear? Mr. SPUBRELL professing
incapacity to read aloud? Sheer affectation! Come, Mr. SPURKKLL,
I am much mistaken if you are wanting in the power to thrill al]
hearts here. Think of us aa instruments ready to respond to your

raise any further obstacles.

Spun: (as he takes the book). I '11 do the best I can! (He looks
at the page in dismay.) Why, look here, it's Poetry! I didn't
bargain for that. Poetry'» altogether out of my line! (Miss SPEL-
WANE opens her eyes to their fullest extent, and retires a few paces
from him; he turns over the leaves backwards until he arrives at the
title-page.) I say, this is rather curious! Who the dickins is
CLARION BLAIR? (The company look at one another with raised
eyebrows and dropped under lips..) Because I never heard of him;
but he seems to have been writing poetry about my bull-dog.
Miss Spelw. (faintly). Writing poetry—about your bull-dog!
Spun: Yes, _tne one you 've all been praising up so. If it isn't
meant for her, it's what you might call a most snrprie-ing coincidence,
for here's the old dog's name as plain as it can be—Andromeda!

"LIVING PICTURES."
THE Downey ones, meaning thereby the photographers W. & D.
"of that ilk," have produced some excellent photographic portraits
in their fifth series recently published. THE CZAREVICH and The
Right Hon. HENRY CHAPLIN, M.P., two sporting names well brought
together, and both capital like-
nesses, though the Baron fancies
that THE CZAREVICH has the best
of it, for secret and silent as
Mr. CHAPLIN is as a politician,
yet did he never manage to keep
so dark as he is represented in
this picture. Here, too, is Mr.
CHARLES SANTLEY — " Charles
our friend "—looking like a mere
boy with " a singing face," where
"Nature, smiling, pave the win-
ning grace." Mr. SYDNEY
GRUNDY, endimanchf, is too
beautiful for words, liut the
picture of Mrs. BANCROFT, wear-
ing fin addition to a trimmed for oloak) a
wonderful kind of "Fellah! don't-know-
yar-fellah!" expression, at once surprised,
liiiinrd, and hurt, does not at all represent
the "little Mrs. B." whom the public knows
and loves. '' How doth the little busy Mrs. B.
delight to bark and bite" might have been
under this portrait, and DOWNEY must be
moreDowney another time, and give us a more
characteristic presentment of this lively
comedienne. The Right Hon. ARTHUR J.
BALFOUR is the best of all. Capital. Just the man: "frosty but
kindly." Then there is a first rate portrait of Miss FANNY BROTTOH,
and after her comes the King of SAXOXY!! 0 ALBERT of Saxony!

Perhaps Messrs. DOWNEY, by kind permission of CASSELL & Co., will

BATTLE WITH BACILLI.—Dr. Roux has been successful against the

would sifrnif y that they were lifeless and harmless. "Bravo Roux!"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SONG OF THE LEADERS.
WHEN the much-enduring Dockers,
In the city of the Smoke-Cloud.
By the banks of the Tems-Ri-Va,
Struck to gain a larger stipend,
Lead them on did BURNSHVATHA.
And the ruler of these matters,
Who is called the Bry-Tish-Pu-
Blyek,
Took the side of dock-gate casuals,
Of the somewhat lordly stevedore.
And informed the proud Dy-Reck-
Tas
That they soon must yield to reason;
Gave its sympathy in gallons,
Gave its coin to make a strike-fund;
So the proud Dy-Reck-Tas yielded.
But when many moonshad vanished,
Came the rather wild KEiR-HAR-Di,
Came ToM-MAXtr the earnest minded,
Talked of " Independent Labour,"'
Soundly rated BURNSIWATHA
And all useful Labour-Members.
Then the strong man, BURXSI-
WATHA,
Hurled their language hack with
interest.
With the breathing of his nostrils,
With the tempest of his anger,
Hurled it back on his assailants.
Said TOM-MANX was feather-headed,
Said the rather wild KEiii-HAR-Di
Was no better than a " bounder."
And the Independent Lab'rers,
Not to be outdone in scolding,
Scandalised poor BtiRNsnvATHA,
Said they thought himquiteconoeited,
Called him " Boss," likewise " Bull-
dozing."
And the Bry-Tish-Pu-Blyck won-
dered
At the manners of these leaders,
At the Unionists' disunion.
"Go, my sons," it said, "instanter,
Go back to your homes and people;
Slay all ravening labour-sweaters,
All the Kum-Panies, the giants,
All the serpents, the Emp-Loias;
But, forgoodness' sakehave done with
Petty piques and jealous slangings;
Or, next time you ask for coppers
For the holy cause of Labour,
You will find thesecoppers wanting!"

BAYARD AND BOBBY.
OH, ROBERT, in our hours of ease
Butt of those outworn pleasantries,
Not less with pride thy praise we hear
Hymned in another hemisphere,
When BAYABD, chivalrously graphic,
Tells how you regulate the traffic.
Firm as a statue on its plinth
'Midst the vertiginous labyrinth
Of circus, street and bridge you stand,
And rule the storm with calm, un-
armed hand.
Rarely our soldiers of the law
Do Themis' awful truncheon draw,
Their Orphic whistle subdue can
All save the crew of HOOLIGAN.
Though western JONATHAN prefer
A force not vainly clariger,
Yet BAYARD, taught in English ways,
That suaver regiment must praise
That trusts to moral weight and nerve
And keeps the bludgeon in reserve.
Stalwart and patient 'midst the strife
Of all our seething city life.
When pageants twice or thrice a year
Throw the whole Empire out of gear,
Then, stolid symbol of good sense,
A wonder-worker, sans pretence,
Fulfill'st authority's decrees,
With thy familiar "Stand back,
please!"
And rather by that sober charm
Than by the might of brawny arm,
The many-headed own thy sway;
They laugh, they jostle, and obey.
Worthy thy deeds of loftier rhyme,
Than topic-song or pantomime.
Not quite sublime, but on the border,
Type of our British law and order,
Thy figure shall be graved upon
The frieze of some new Parthenon,
Wherein by glyphic art portray'd
Reigns the ideal parlour-maid.
Thy dauntless soul's domestic lure
Trim, natty, roguish, and demure,
Waiting the age's unborn LA YARD
To illustrate the praise of BAYAHD.

"Begorrah, 'tis callin' he's afther, the bhoy,

An' he sat down quite natteral-loike in a chair.
"So, RORY," ses he, "'tis a vote ye 've got now'("
"That's thrue though ye ses it," ses Oi, wid a bow.
"Deloighted!" ses he, "'tis meself that is gild,
For shure ye 're disarvin' it, RORY me lad.
An' how are ye goin' to use it'(" ses he,
"Ye could scarcely do betther than give it to me."

"What! Give it away, Sorr ?-Me vote, Sorr P" Oi cries.
"D 'ye think that Oi 've waited ontil Oi am gray,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAEI.
THE SONC OF THE LEADERS.
WHEN the mueh-endurinuDockers,
In the city of the Smoke-Cloud.
By the banks of the Terns-Ri-Va,
Struck to gain a larger stipend,
Lead them on did BCRNSJWATHA.
And the ruler of these matters,
Who is called the Bry-Tish-Pu-
Blyck,
Took the side of dock-gate casuals,
Of the somewhat lordly stevedore.
And informed the proud Dy-Reck-
Tas
That they soon must yield to reason;
Gave its sympathy in gallons,
Gave its coin to make a strike-fund;
So the proud Dy-Reck-Tas yielded.
But whenmanymoonshad vanished,
Came the rather wild KEiR-HAR-Dl,
Came TOM-MANN the earnest minded,
Talked of " Independent Labour,'1
Soundly rated BURNSIWATHA
And all useful Labour-Members.
Then the strong man, BUBNSI-
WATHA,
Hurled their language back with
interest.
With the breathing of his nostrils,
With the tempest of his anger,
Hurled it back on his assailants.
Said TOM-MANX was feather-headed,
Said the rather wild KETR-H/ui-Di
Was no better than a "bounder."
And the Independent Lab'rers,
Not to be outdone in scolding,
Scandalised poor BCRNSRVATHA,
Said they thought him quite conceited,
Called him " Boss," likewise "Bull-
dozing."
And the Bry-Tish-Pu-Blyck won-
dered
At the manners of these leaders,
At the Unionists' disunion.
"Go, my sons," it said, "instanter,
Go back to your homes and people;
Slay all ravening labour-sweaters,
All the Kum-Panies, the giants,
All the serpents, the Emp-Loias;
But, for goodness' sakehave done with
Petty piques and jealous slangings;
Or, next time you ask for coppers
For the holy cause of Labour,
You will find thesecopperswanting!"

BAYARD AND BOBBY.
OH, ROBERT, in our hoxirs of ease
Butt of those outworn pleasantries,
Not less with pride thy praise we hear
Hymned in another hemisphere,
When BAYARD, chivalrously graphic,
Tells how you regulate the traffic.
Firm as a statue on its plinth
'Midst the vertiginous labyrinth
Of circus, street and bridge you stand,
And rule the storm with calm, un-
armed hand.
Rarely our soldiers of the law
Do Themis' awful truncheon draw,
Their Orphic whistle subdue can
All save the crew of HOOLIGAN.
Though western JONATHAN prefer
A force not vainly clarir/er,
Yet BAYARD, taught in English ways,
That suaver regiment must praise
That trusts to moral weight and nerve
And keeps the bludgeon in reserve.
Stalwart and patient'midst the strife
Of all our seething city life.
When pageants twice or thrice a year
Throw the whole Empire out of gear,
Then, stolid symbol of good sense,
A wonder-worker, satis pretence,
Fulfill'st authority's decrees,
With thy familiar "Stand
please!"
And rather by that sober charm
Than by the might of brawny arm,
The many-headed own thy sway;
They laugh, they jostle, and obey.
Worthy thy deeds of loftier rhyme,
Than topic-song or pantomime.
Not quite sublime, but on the border,
Type of our British law and order,
Thy figure shall be graved upon
The frieze of some new Parthenon,
Wherein by glyphic art portray'd
Reigns the ideal parlour-maid.
Thy dauntless soul's domestic lure
Trim, natty, roguish, and demure,
Waiting the age's unborn LAYARD
To illustrate the praise of BATAHD.

"Begorrah, 'tis callin' he's afther, the bhoy,

An' he sat down quite natteral-loike in a chair.

"That's thrue though ye ses it," tes Oi, wid a bow.
"Deloighted'. " ses he, "'tis meself that is ghd,
For shure ye 're disarvin' it, RORY me lad.

"Ye could scarcely do betther than give it to me."
Oi stared at the Colonel, amazed wid surprise.
"What! Give it away, Son- ?-Me vote, Sorr?" Oi cries.
"D 'ye think that Oi 've waited pntil Oi am gray,

MAYENNAISE VERSUS
MAYONNAISE.
( V\dt last Number of " Punch.")
DEAR Punch, your praise
Of Mayonnaise
Is certainly most telling:
But don t it seem
That such a theme
Deserves the proper spelling?
I sometimes look
At a cookery book
By A. DUMAS, the yovnjer;
And find he says
That Mayennaise
(A certain cure for hunger)
Should be spelt so;
Not with an o,
But, like Mayenne, that city,
Whose siege's fame
Supplied the name
Mis-spelt now; more 'a the pity
Maybe D 's right,
Although it might
Be just a yarn he's tilling.
So hope your bard
Won't bs too hard
And simply " D " my spelling.
'ToTHER WAT ABOUT.—Mr.
LE GALLIENNE says, epijjram-
matically, that "Beauty is the
smile on the face of Power."
Humph! Gallant Mr. Punch
prefers to put it the other way,
and say "Power is the smile on
the face of Beauty!" Surely
that is equally true. But it's
a pior rule (or paradox) that
won't work both ways.

"Now that," quoth the Baron emphatically, as he deposed My

powerful, so artistic, so ex-

tives wanted at present) as

mancer has the rare talent of
interesting his reader as much
in the action of his crowds as
he does in the fortunes of his
individuals. He is the Sir
JOHN GILBERT of the pen; and
Ihe Baron cautiously expresses
his opinion that My Lady
"He saw the greatest quail Mutha is not so viry far on

the works of other modern
romancers, ir may be fafely said that, from Chapter XXVI. to
Chapter XXIX. inclusive, the situations are as exciting as any ever
invented by RIDER HAGGARD, Louis B. STEPHEXSON, or JULKS
VERNE; "which " the Baron freely admits, "is saying a good deal,
—Treasure Island always excepted."
The Baron anticipates "Next please," with pleasure, hut at the
same time he would draw the attention of the prolific author to Ihe
ancient proverb "fettina lente," which is not at variance with his
exclaiming "On! STANLEY (WEYMAN) on!" and these are "the last
words" (for the present on MM subject) of the

POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENTS.
[On hearing that an Archdeacon had withdrawn from the School-Board
Controversy btcause he found himself opposed to hia liishop.]
THE Archdeacon is "sorry bespoke." Not that he has changed
his opinion—oh dear no! far from that. But the Bishop thinks
otherwise, so the Archdeacon ^etire^ as gracefully as may be from
the controversy. He is, he explains, as it were, the Bishop's
"oculus "—the man to whom the Bishop can proudly point, and say
"All my eye!" This theory of subordination of thought to one's
superior highly suggestive. For instance, who will be surprised to
read the following highly authentic document, now made public for
the first time.
To the Editor of the Once a-Xonth Review,
DEAR SIR,—With reference to my article "Is Horse-racing
Justifiable f" I desire to make known that while I still strongly
adhere to my views therein expressed as to the wickedness of the
turf, I shall, for the reason I am about to mention, take no further
active part in the controversy. I find that the PRIME MINISTER is
the owner of some racehorses (a fact previously unknown to me), and
as I am his "dextera," if it is not presumptive to say so, it would
clearly be unbecoming on my part to take up any antagonistic
position. However much I may regret having to take this course, I
am sure you will agree with me that it is the only one which is open
to me. Yours faithfully, W-LL-AM V-RX-N H-EC-UHT.
DEAR Ma. PUNCH,—Last Sunday evening I fully intended going
to church. I put on my most attractive bonnet, and an absolutely
bewitching jacket, when I discovered that JIM (he's my husband,
you know) did not intend to go out. As I had read a little while
before the new archidiaconal theory of obedience, that of course
prevented my going out. Clearly as I am JIM'S "better-half" I
couldn't go anywhere that he didn't go. Please, Mr. Punch, was I
right? Or can it be that the archdeacon was wrong?

Yours very perplexed, ETHEL DIXMERE.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A PHALSE NOTE ON GEORGE THE FOURTH.
(A Brown Study in a Yellow Boot:.)
NAY, but it is useless to protest. Much
bosh and bauble-tit and pop-limbo has been
talked about GEORGE THE PUORTJI. THACKE
BAY denunciated him in his charming style
(we never find THACKERAY searching for the
mot juste as for a wisp of hay in a packet of

fly Mortiii'llnir',0 H'Aitkenlry.
needles), but inverideed he was not sufficiently
merciful to the last gentleman in Europe. We
must not judge a prince too harshly. How
many temptations he had with all the wits
and flutterpates and malaperts gyring and
gimbling round him! GEOBGE was a sportsman.
He would spend the morning with his valet
(who was a hero to him), assuming gorgeous
apparel, and tricking himself, with brush
and pigment, into more charm. He was
implected with a passion for the pleasures of
the wardrobe, and had a Royal memory for
old coats. Then he would saunter into
WHITE'S for ale and tittle-tattle, and drive
a friend into the country, stopping on the
way for cursory visits at the taverns; I
mean, swearing if the ale was not good. He
had his troubles. Queen CAROLINE was a
mimsy, out-moded woman, a slv serio, who
gadded hither and thither shrieking for the
unbecoming. Mrs. Pnox ensorcelled GEOBGE
with her beautiful, silly phace, shadowed with
vermeil tinct and trimly pencilled. There
was no seeernment between ntr soul and sur-
face; she was mere, insouciant, with a rare
dulcedo.
GEOKHE collected locks of hair and what
not, and what not. He gave in his bright
flamboyance a passing renascence to Socielv.
But the Victorian era came soon, and angels
rushed in where fools had not feared to
tread, and hung the land with rep*, and
drove Artifice phorth, and set MARTIN
Tnrpp.K on a throne of mahogany to rule over
them.
In the tangled aecrescency of GEOBGE'S
degringolade—in fact when he was dyeing—
he thought he had led the charge of Water-
loo! Tristfully he would describe the scene,
referring to the Duke of WELLIHGTOX for
well known the old soldier was never there
himself.
It is brillig, and from my window at the
Metropole, Brighton, I see the trite lawns
and cheeky minarets of the Pavilion. I can
see the rooms crusted with ormolu, the fauns
foisted on the ceiling, the ripping rident god-
desses on the walls. Once I phancied I saw a
swaying pbigure, and a wine-red phace. . . .
P.8.—I like to phancy the watchful evil
phaces of my Criticks as they read this article.
Phair men, but infelix, they will lavish their
anger in epigramme. Not that I care a
little tittle about adverse remarks kicked
from a gutter into a garret! But! But let
them not outgribe too soon, but rather dance
and be glad, and trip the cjckawhoop. For!
For, slithy toves as they are, they will read
it with tears and desiderium, unless I do as
did ABTEMCS of shameful memory, and in
jolliness and glad indulgence whisper to
them— THIS is A GOAK!
THE LAY OF THE VIGIL ANT.
I 'VE a natural eye for evil,
And folly I love to shoot,
And to prod for a latent weevil
In the wholesomest-looking root.
Mv ipse dixit must always fix it—
The song, the dance, the cup;
And my back gets stiffer the more you differ
From the standard that I set up.
1 went to the " halls" crusading.
And I found what I meant to find.
I had said they were all degrading,
And I never alter my mind.
In virtue strong I gazed at the throng
Of smoking chatters and grinners;
Wi th a i ighteous frown my soul looked down
On the publicans and the sinners.
Loftily, proudly, lonely
I bore what I had to bear,
For I knew that I was the only
Respectable Person there!
That the others were not respectable
Was easy and plain to see,
For they frankly found delectable
What didn't appeal to me.
Yet none of the revellers stonily,
Or scornfully seem'd to stare,
They took no note of the only
Respectable Person there.
My vigilant virtue perchance may hurt you
By putting constructions worse on
The pose or picture that draws no strictures
From the non-respectable person.
But my earliest vigilance waked
To look askance at the nude.
As another name for naked,
And therefore distinctly rude.
From an icy peak of stupendous cheek
On an alien world I glare,
And never feel lonely, although I'm the only
Respectable Person there!
WOSDEBFUL FEAT OF STBENOTH. — The
strong man supporting four men on a chair
is nothing in comparison with an entire train
"held up" by four men! This was reported
in the Pall Mall Gazette last Saturday as
having occurred to a "Texas Pacidc train."
The armed robbers went off with 20.000dollars.
Nice "Pacific" train to travel by!
HEIBLOOMS. — Mr. Punch congratulates
Mr. and Mm. BKEBBOHM THKK, and their
Olive Branch little Miss TBEE, on the valu-
able fourenirs of their Balmoral performance
presented them by HEB MAJESTY, which, from
all others, will distinguish this particular
MORBIDEZZA.
MOB BID neshliness is mark
Of the modem (sham) Art-lover.
Vulgar seems the soaring laik,
Music (and meat) are in the plover.
Painters once made pink the flesh
Of their Titianesque creations;
Caught in Sham's sepulchral mesh
Art now raves of Green Carnations!

FIRST IMPRESSIONS.
At Lugano. — Geographically this seems
to be Italy. But people remind one
always of the artificial frontier which makes
it Switzerland. What's that matter?
Get up early. Ha!
there it is. Cloud-
less sky! And such
a blue! Ultramarine
at a guinea the thim-
bleful. Hurry down
to enjoy its beauty
as long as possible.
Fortunate I did so,
for by ten o'clock it
has all vanished. Go
up a hill. View from
top would be fairly
clear for Helvellyn.
But for Italy! Ami-
able and chatty Italian
reminds me that I am
not in Italy. Ah, of
course not. Will get there as soon as I can.
Meanwhile mope in hotel, for it is now rain-
ing steadily. Not a magnificent mountain
downpour, with thunder and lightning, howl-
ing of wind, crashing of elements, alarums
and excursions, and that sort of thing; only
a quiet, steady rain, which would be disliked
even in Ambleside. But in Ambleside there
would be a fire. Here I sit in a draughty,
chilly corridor, with some melancholy Ger-
mans, all of us wearing overcoats indoors.
They remind me that I am not in Italy.
Anyone could see that.
At PnWanra.—Here on Lago Maggiore
there must really be the ROWBOTHAM
effects. My room looks over the lake. "La
vitta £ bellissima" fays the waiter in the
evening. Hooray! Now to forget the gloom
of Switzerland and England. Wake early.
Misty morning. Good sign of fine weather
probably. Into bed again. Wake again. Only
half-past seven. Still misty. Into bed again.
Wake once more. Still mistr. Evidently
quite early. Hullo! still half-past seven.
Watch stopped. Ring. "Si, Signore," says
the chambermaid, in the mixed dialect which
she has invented for foreigners, "il est died
heures." Ten I By Jove! With that fog P
She assures me it will clear away, "se non
<><jgi, doniani." Bellissima i-isla looks exactly
like Derwentwater in rain. Grey water, grey
sky, grey mountains, wreathed in grey mist.
It does not clear to-day, so it may to-morrow.
Next day even worse. Fog greyer, and rain
with it. Mud everywhere. Notice a practical
German tourist with three umbrellas strapped
on his knapsack. Wi-e man! He knows this
climate, and also the advantage of a change of
clothes, or of umbrellas. f>a useful to have a
morning umbrella, an afternoon umbrella, and
a sort of evening-dress umbrella to bring down
to the table d'hule. When tired of gazing at
the mist, I read a three days old Times, pre-
served in the reading-room. Hullo! what is
that sound? A piano-organ! Heavens! To
think that I should have travelled hundreds
of miles from London to hear the grinding
of an organ while I read the Times in a fog!
Why, in Kensington Gardens I could have
oorroboration. An unfortunate slip, for it is
done as much. A FIRST IMPRESSIONIST.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH TO THE NEW ATTORNEY-GENERAL.
LAW is not Pan; but "BOB" 's a man,
To make us sure indeed.
Themis will play airs bright and gay,
Armed with this " vocal REID"!
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.

"' Now I 'm furnished,'" hummed the Baron. "' Now I 'm fur-
nished'—with several books for my journey, and ""Tickets,
please," broke in the inspector. "Just when I was comfortable,"
growled the Baron; "but no matter. And now for the Pen and
Pencil Sketches."
The father of Mr. STACY MARKS predestined him for the coach-
building business. Providence, interposing, made him a painter, and
the gaiety of nations has been increased by the possession of some
storks. In Pen and Pencil Sketches (CnATTO AND WlNDt's) he has
given the world some reminiscences of a career justly crowned by
the laurels of the Royal Academy. The work is in two volumes,
and my Baronite says would have been more than twice as good
had it been in one. The first volume is charming, with its
chat about LEIGH'S studio and the men met there; of CHABLES
KEENE and the delightful cruise off Gravesend in the William and
Mary; of merry days with the St. John's Wood clique; of nights
at ARTHUR LEWIS'S; and of days with FRED WALKER. When
the flood of memory runs dry, and there still remains a second
volume to be produced, Mr. MARKS grows desperate, and shovels in
anything he finds handy in the pigeon-holes of his desk. Thus the
pleased reader finds reprinted articles that appeared in the Spectator
thirty years ago. when Mr. MARKS was art critic to that respectable
journal. Also there is a description of BAMPTON, which once thrilled
the readers of the Tirerton Gazette. This gives to the second
volume something of the smell of an apple store-room. But the
first is good enough to atone for the burden of the second. By
a happy coincidence, whilst Mr. Du MACRIER in Trilby has
made all the world in love with Little Billee, he appears under his
own name in many of Mr. MABKS' pages, and is always the same
charming, simple-minded, sensitive man of genius. It is pleasant to
read how our Mr. AGNEW—" WIL-
LIAM" the wise call him—gave the
young painter his first substantial
lift. WALKER had painted a picture
he called "Spring," a young girl
gathering primroses in a wood. Yield-
ing to the advice of his friends, he
put on it a price the amount of which
abashed him. Mr. AGNEW saw the
picture, recognised its merit, and
wrote a cheque for the full amount
asked. When the young artist heard
of his good fortune he burst into
tears, aud gasping out "I must go
and tell my mother," rushed from the place. Of the original sketches
with whicn the volumes are enriched are some pen-and-ink drawings
by FBED WALKER, which reveal in a new light the painter of " The
Almshouse." Amongst many good stories, Mr. MARKS tells how he
was addressed by a clergyman, who, believing from his name that
he was a Jew, invited him to look in at his church and be converted.

"Little Billee."

"A Late Physician."
MARCO'S" reply conclusively proved his possession of a Christian
spirit.
SINCE SAMUEL WABHEN wrote his Diary of a Late'Physician,—
to which, as the Baron supposes, allu-
sion is made in p. 200 of this book,
where the narrator says, "Thus it
happens that the ablest chronicler of
their (i.e. medical men's) experiences in
pur literature was a lawyer, —no more
interesting, and occasionally sensa-
tional, stories have appeared than those
written by Mr. CONAN DOYLE, and pub-
lished by METHTTEK & Co. in a single
volume, under the title of Hound the
Red Lamp. One of these, A Strag-
gler of 15, has been recently developed
into a one act dramatic sketch for Mr. IRVING, who, in the part of
the ancient veteran "lagging superfluous," is reported to have
achieved a remarkable success. For pathos, A Physiologist's Wife is
as perfect in style as it is original in design; ot those who want
to take something strong before going to bed, the Baron can confi-
dently recommend The Case of Lady Sannox ; while for those of the

Why the blush-rose

TWO WAYS OF AUDITING.
I.—THE OLD WAT.
SCENE.— A Chamber in a Civic Building. The Tuicn Clerk and
the Auditor discovered at a table covered with papers.
Clerk. Then I believe that you are entirely satisfied with the
accounts?
Auditor. Oh, perfectly. (After a pause.) There is one item I
wanted to ask about—I ve no doubt you'll be able to explain it
satisfactorily—it's this "£25 for ginger-beer to the Mayor and
Council on the occasion of opening the new Cemetery." Does not—
er—that sum represent a rather large number of bottles?
Clerk (in an off-hand way). Well, we put down ginger-beer, you
know, as it looks better, and there's a rather strong temperance
party in the borough. Of course, it was really champagne—"extra
sec, too, you bet!
Auditor. Oh, of course. I merely mentioned the matter for the
sake of form. And the "£15 for cigars "—that was an expenditure
incurred at the same time, I conclude?
Clerk (carelessly). Oh, yes. Y'see, one of the Councillors is the
leading tobacconist in the place. '< 1-
Auditor (relieved). Ah, that accounts for it. Then these "models
of the Crematorium in gold and jewels, as brooches for the wives of
the Councillors "—1 see they come to £105 in all.
Clerk (sternly). You don t object to the brooches, I presume f
Auditor (anxiously). Oh, not at all. Not in the least. A most—
er—praiseworthy method of spending the ratepayers' money.
Clerk. Quite so. Our Mayor's our leading jeweller, you know.
So, as you've put "Examined and Approved," shall we go in to
lunch? For a "cold collation on the occasion of the audit" our
Council always allows £10. It'll be rather a good feed.
II.—THE NEW WAY.
Auditor. Oh, what larks!
[Subsides into a chair, and takes two minutes to recover from
his fit of merriment.
Clerk (surprised). I really fail to see where the joke comes in.
Auditor. Oh, don't you know? I'm one of the new class of comio
auditors—"made in Manchester." What tickles me is this item of
£17 for gold match-boxes for lighting the cigars of the Mayor and
Aldermen on the occasion of the visit to the Sewage Farm. There 'a
persiflage, if you like!
Clerk (emtling). I 'm glad you take so humorous a view of the
matter. Of course you allow that expenditure?
Auditor. Allow it! Not for worlds. Then—(tcith difficulty re-
straining another outburst of mirth)—how about "£27 for oysters
and Chablis" after the visit P
Clerk. The Council naturally required some refreshment at the
end of the journey—quite a quarter of a mile, in their own carriages
— and oysters were rather dear just then—a little out of season.
Auditor (after a guffaw). Capital! "Out of season"—out of
reason, too, /should say. Of course I must surcharge the oysters and
Chablis. Really, I 'm enjoying myself immensely I
Clerk (gloomily). I hope the Council will feel equal enjoyment at
your report. Do you mean seriously
Auditor. Seriously! Not a bit of it. I tell you I'ma comic charac-
ter. And what better practical joke can one play than suddenly to come
luxuries? Afraid I must strike out these items of '' Visits to Olympia
by Corporation to inspect the lighting arrangements," and " Ditto at
Empire and Alhambra Theatres." No doubt the Aldermen will be

THE POLITE GUIDE TO THE CIVIL SEEVICE.
(By an A fable Philosopher and Courteous Friend.)
How TO ENTEH THE CIVIL SERVICE.
IN the good old days of yore there was little trouble in
obtaining admission to the Civil Service. All that was neces-
sary was a slight knowledge of a Cabinet Minister, and a smat-
tering of schooling. The latter might be obtained at Eton,
Winchester, Rugby, Westminster, or Harrow. The acquaint-
ance of the Minister, of course, had to be made by your father.
You were too young to have attracted the attention of so
important a personage. Suppose you had reached the mature
age of eighteen, and had given up the round jackets and collars
of boyhood, and had assumed stick-ups" and "cutaways."
your father would probably ask you "What you intended to do
next?"
"No, my dear fellow," would be the paternal reply to a
suggestion about Trinity or Christ Church. "I am afraid I
can't manage either. You see, vour two elder brothers went to
the University, but then we could find them family livings. It
would be useless to let you read for the Bar, because we haven't
any of us married into a single iirm of Solicitors; and in these
hard times I really can't aiford to buy you a commission."
You would notice sotto roce that when ways and means were
being discussed, times were always hard.
"I suppose you could be a doctor if you pleased; but walk-
ing the hospitals is not a particularly pleasant occupation. Then
there is another opening—why not try the Civil Service?"
You would rather freshen up at this. You would have read
in a comic paper, that never will be nameless, lhat Govern-
ment clerks were like the fountains in Trafalgar Square (old
style), "because they played from ten to four."
"Well, yes," you would return. "I don't think I should
mind that EO much. It would be rather fun to go to Paris as an
attache."
"I 'm afraid I couldn't quite manage that, my dear boy," your
fond parent would respond. "They don't pay attaches at first, and
so you would have to be satisfied with the War Office or the
Admiralty instead of the Foreign Office."
"All nght, Pater," you would say, and leave the matter in the
hands of the elder generation.
Then your father would write to any Cabinet Minister of his
acquaintance about things in general and nothing in particular,
and would add a " P.S." asking for a nomination. In due course a
reply would come granting the sweet boon. A test examination
would follow of a perfunctory character, and an intimation of your
appointment would be the sequel. Then you would take up your
daily residence in Pall Mall or Whitehall for twenty or thirty years
and then retire as a Knight or a C.B. Thus was done in the com-

"ARK PAGINATIONS WHITE BEHIND?"
the Public Squander Department to inform yon when the inscription
of such and such a Milestone was last restored? The official will
fence the query. Probably his Private Secretary, considering you a
new man, will have failed to furnish the necessary information.
You must expect a little retardation at the first set-off.
And here let me point out for your future guidance the importance
of having a private secretary thoroughly up to his work. Had your
answerer been possessed of the proper sort of assistant you would
have been discovered, respectfully button-holed, and perforce satis-
fied. You would never have had the heart to put your question
about the Milestones. But the particular Private Secretary of your
answerer being tint up to his work you get snubbed.
But don't be discouraged; stick to your Milestones.
Bombard "the_ Right Hon. Gentleman opposite" with questions.
Ask him for particulars about the Milestones in the Old Kent Road
and on Salisbury Plain. If he requests notice, give him notice. By
paratively long ago. But now-a-days another plan has to be adopted, degrees you will find that you are becoming an institution. Mile-
Inttead of entering the Civil Service as a junior join it as a senior.
As a preliminary you must get into the House. This is simpler
than having to cram and then stand the racket of a competitive
examination. Any one under certain conditions can enter Parliament,
but the Civil Service Commissioners bar the entrance to the Govern-
ment offices with equally certain regulations. For the sake
of anmment let me assume that you are in the House.
You have stood for Slocum-on-the-Marsh, and have per-
suaded the Slocum-on-the-Marshers to elect you. As an
M.P. you are duly qualified to accept any appointment
under the Crown when the Government ask you. The best
plan is to think of an office and then add one to it—yourself.
"Why not the Public Squander Department'?" you ask yourstlf.
To which you reply with a second question, "Why not?"
Yes, the P. S. D. is not half bad. But how to get into it. Well,
why not take up Milestones? All the world knows that the Public
Squander Department are responsible for all the Milestones not
under the superintendence of the county authorities. Go for the
Milestones.
Begin with a question. Learn that the Milestones in the Old

stones are your specialty. When the House is sitting demand
particulars. When the House is up, write to the papers. Move
for returns about Milestones. Go down to Slocnm-on-the-Marsh and
read papers on Milestones. If possible, be made a F.S.A. on the
strength of your knowledge of Milestones. So identify yourself
with Milestones that when your name is casually mentioned
anywhere, let it be common form for some one to say, "Of
course, the chap who looks after the Milestones."
Wait patiently until your side move over from the Opposi-
tion to the Government benches. Then will come your oppor-
tuntity. You will have sat upon a Milestone Commission.
You nave been verv inttrumental in getting Milestones
relished. You have caused Milestones to be multiplied. All these
services must be recognised. And they will.
Yon will find yourself offered the Secretaryship of the Public
Squander Department—to take care of the Milestones. Accept it.
You will now have become a Civil Servant. On some future occasion
I may suggest how you may successfully perform your duties in your
new position.

PABT XVm.—THE LAST STRAW.
SCENE XXVII. (continued).—The Chinese Drawing Room. SPUH-
RELL'S ingenuous remark upon the coincidence of the title of the
rolume in his hand with the name of his bull-dog has produced
a painful silence, which no one has sufficient presence of mind
to break for several seconds.
Miss Spelicane (to herself}. Not CLABION BLATB! Not even a
poet! I—I could slap him!
Pilliner (to himself). Poor dear VIVIEN! But if people will insist
on patting a strange poet, they mustn't be surprised if they get a
nasty bite!
Lady Maisie (to herself). He didn't write Andromeda! Then
he hasn't got my letter after all! And I 've been such a brute to the
poor dear man! Hote lucky I said nothing
about it to GERALD!
Captain Thicknesse (to himself). So
he ain't the bard! . . . Now I see why
MAISIE's been behavin' so oddly all the
evenin'; she spotted him, and didn't like
to speak out. Tried to give me a hint,
though. Well, I shall stay out my leave
now!
Lady Rhoda (to herself). I thought all
along he seemed too good a sort for a poet!
Archie (to himself). It's all very well;
but how about that skit he went up to
write on us? He must be a poet of sorts.
Mrs. Brooke- Chatter is (to herself).
This is fearfully puzzling. What made
him say that about "Lady Grisoline "?
The Bishop (to himself). A crushing
blow for the Countess; but not unsalu-
tary. I am distinctly conscious of feeling
more kindly disposed to that young man.
Now why? [He ponders.
Lady Lullington (to herself). I thought
this young man was going to read us some
of his poetry; it's too tiresome of him to
stop to tell us about his bull-dog. As if
anybody cared what he called it!
Lord Lullington (to himself). Uncom-
monly awkward, this! If I could catch
LAURA'S eye—but I suppose it would
hardly be decent to go just yet.
Lady Culrerin (to herself). Can ROHE-
SIA have known this? What possible
object could she have had in And
oh, dear, how disgusted RUPERT will be!
Sir Rupert (to himself). Seems a decent
young chap enough! Too bad of ROHESIA
to let him in for this. I don't care a straw
what he is—he's none the worse for not
being a poet.
Lady Canlire (to herself). What is he
maundering about? It's utterly incon-
ceivable that / should have made any
mistake. It's only too^clear what the
cause is—Claret.'
Spurrell (aloud, good-humouredly). Too
bad of you to try and spoof me like this
before everybody, Miss SPELWANE! I
don't know whose idea it was to play me suoh a trick, but
Miss Spelw. (indistinctly). Please understand that nobody here
had the least intention of playing a trick upon you!
Spun: Well, if you say so, of course But it looked rather
like it, asking me to read when I 've about as much poetrv in
me as—as a pot hat! Still, if I 'm wanted to read aloud, I shall be
happy to oblige

think of troubling you under the euroumatances! (In desperation.)

Spurr. (to/iimself, during Miss SPELW ANB'sronj). Wonder what's
put them off being read to all of a sudden. (As his eye happens to
rest on the binding of the rolume on his knee.) Hullo! This cover's
pink, with silver things, not unlike cutlets, on it! Didn't EMMA
ask me ?By George, if it's that! I may get down to the
Housekeeper's Room, after all I As soon as ever this squalling stops
I '11 find out; I can't go on like this! (Miss SPELWANE leaves the
piano; everybody plunges feverishly into conversation on the first
subject—other than poetry or dogs—that presents itself, until Lord

last of 'em—now for it! ... (He pulls himself together, and ap-
proaches his host and hostess.') Hem, Sir RUPEBT, and your lady-
ship, it's occurred to me that it's just barely possible you may have
got it into your heads that I was something in the poetical way.
Sir Rup. (to himself). Not this poor young chapes fault; must let
him down as easily as possible! (Aloud.) Not at all—not at all! Ha
—assure you we quite understand; no necessity to say another word
about it.
Spun: (to himself). Just my luck! They quite understand! No
Housekeeper's Room for me this journey 1 (Aloud.) Of course I
knew the Countess, there, and Lady MAISIE, were fully aware all
along (To Lady MAISIE, as stifled exclamations reach his ear.)
You were, were'nt you?
Lady Maisie (hastily). Yes, yes, Mr. SPUBRELL. Of course! It 'a
all perfectly right!
Smirr. (to the others). You see, I should never have thought of
coming in as a visitor if it hadn't been for
! the Countess; she would have it that it
was all right, and that I needn't be afraid
I shouldn't be welcome.
Lady Cuh. To be sure—any friend of
my sister-in-law's
Lady Cant. ALBINIA, I have refrained
from speech as long as possible; but this
is really too much! You don't suppose I
should have introduced Mr. SPURRELL
here unless I had had the strongest
reasons for knowing, however he may be
pleased to mystify us now, that he, and
nobody else, is the author of Andromeda.'
And I, for one, absolutely decline to be-
lieve in this preposterous story of his
about a bull-dog.
Spurr. But your ladyship must have
known! Why, you as good as asked me
on the way here to put you down for a
bull-pup!
Lady Cant. Never, never! A bull-pup
is the last creature I should ever dream of
coveting. You were obliging enough to
ask me to accept a presentation copy of
your verses.
Spurr. Was I? I don't exactly see
how I could have been, considering I
never made a rhyme in my life!
Sir Rup. There, there, ROHISIA, it was
your mistake; but as we are indebted to
it for the pleasure of making Mr. SPOB-
HELL'S acquaintance
Lady Cant. I am not in the habit of
making mistakes, RUPERT. I don't know
what you and ALBINIA and MAISIE may
know that I am in ignorance of, but, since
you feern to have betn aware from the
first that Mr. SPUBBKLL was not the poet
you had invited here to meet me, will you
kindly explain what has become of the
real author?

know and I don t care.'

Lady Cant, (closing her eyes). Pray let us avoid any sartorial dis-
cussions! We are waiting to hear about this person.
Spurr. Well, I found I 'd got on his things by mistake, and I went
up as soon as I could after dessert to my room to take 'em off, and
there he was, with a waste-paper basket on his head
Lady Cant. A waste-paper Dasket on his head! And pray what
should he have that for '<
Spurr. He said he wouldn't take it off till he saw me. And I
never saw anyone in such a mess with ink and flour as he was!
Lady Cant. Ink and flour, indeed! This rigmarole gets more
ridiculous every moment! You can't seriously expect anyone here to
believe it! [ARCHIE discreetly retires to the smoking-room.
Spun: Well, I rather think somebody must have fixed up a booby
trap for me, you know, and he happened to go in first and get the
benefit of it. And he was riled, very naturally, thinking 7 d done

THE NEW CANDIDATE.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—I trust you will give me the hospitality of your
columns (and thus save me the cost of extensive advertising) to
announce that I intend to offer myself as a candidate for all the eleven
divisions at the forthcoming School Board Election. I do this for
several reasons. In the first place, as I have no more chance in any
one place more than in any otner, I feel it quite impossible to make
any choice. Besides, to be elected at the top of eleven polls would be
an unique distinction, second only to being defeated at the bottom of
eleven. In the next place, as I can find no other persons who will
come forward on my platform, I am bound to offer myself everr-
where. My views are extensive, not to say peculiar. On the
religious question, I agree with everything that has been said by
everybody. I hope in this way to avoid incurring odium theologicurn
of any kind. I am in favour of no one paying rates unless he has
children actually at a Board School. I am told that this will not
secure for me the Labour Vote, but it ought, at any rate, to rally to
my side all the " intelligent and respectable." On all other points I
believe I am well fitted to sit on the London School Board. I under-
stand that at its meetings oysters and Chablis are sometimes the order
of the day. If I am returned, my main object, I avow it frankly,
will be to make them the standing order. Soliciting the vote of
every patriotic citizen, I am,
Yours up-to-(being-a-candi-)date,

WHEW I was bound by Party ties to play the bold Premier,
I shouldered of my gun, my lads, and started void of fear;
With my trusty lurcher at my heels, to whom the sport is dear,
For he 's game for tight by day or night at the season of the year!
As I and my bold comrade were after bird or hare.
The gamekeeper was watching us; for him we did not care.
For we were on our ground, my boys, grounds free to tyke or peer;
And they 're my delight by day or night at the season of the ycar!
As I and my bold comrade were in the Peers' Preserve,
We heard the keeper's footsteps, but we did not halt or swerve.
But I whistled—to keep up my pluck—a song to sportsmen dear:
"Oh it'» my delight on a shiny night, in the season of the year!"
The Gamekeeper popped through the copse, and faced us with a
frown;
He's got a black-a-vised stern phiz, and a coat o' velvet brown.
He says " Hillo, Sir! Poaching 1" I retorts, "Oh, don't you fear!
A gent may poach his own preserves at the season of the year!"
He says, "You ought to be ashamed to set so bad example!
A sportsman true won't join the crew who trespass, trap, and
trample.
A dirty bird fouls its own nest!" he adds, with a sour sneer.
"Swells should not poach by day or night in the season of the year."
Says I, " Ton sneer, but I 'm your peer, my Sol. The people sent me!
Stare like an owl, or sneer and scowl, you know you can't prevent me!

LOCAL COLOUR.
MR. ASQVITH was reported the other day to have said that the
Government was spoken of as having been accused of refusing so-
called amendments to the Employers'_ Liability Bill in "peacock
temper." The Daily Neva, in referring to this, suggests that
"peacock temper" was a misprint for pique, or temper." But
surely this is not so. Mr. ASQUITH evidently has given in his
adhesion to the new system of "colour adjectives." This opens
great possibilities to the future. Radicals will denounce the " scarlet
scandals of the purple-clad peers." Tories will wax eloquent on
"the pink miasma of revolutionary Radicalism." No one will know
what it all means, but that is part of the programme. Even if this
colour scheme will not work, there is still a justification for the
Asquithian phrase. Everybody has heard of a "foul slander."
Why not a " peacock temper " P
A Case of Parallelism.
(Extracts from the Rtport of a recent Conference.)
"DB. STANLEY BOYD advocated "Mas.STANLEY BOYD thought
the use of milk and lentil soup." that all such novels as The
Heavenly Twins, The Manx-
man, and The Wages of Sin,
should be tabooed."
S[R PETEB.—A well-written letter in the Times last week puts
what may be called "The Hard Case of Sir PETER EDLIN"—and,
indeed, he must be pretty well case-hardened at the Middlesex Ses-
sions by this time— clearly and forcibly before the public. Sir PETER
EDLIN, it seems, has been doin? treble the amount of work for a
two-third's salary. This should be righted, and the Judge at the
Middlesex Sessions should be independent of the would-be ubiquitous
L. C. C. Such is the opinion of this Correspondent to the Times,
and it is doubtless the opinion of a fair and just majority. As
Joseph Surface observes in The School for Scandal, '• Well, it will
give SIR PETER great satisfaction to hear this."

THE LINKS.
Tis a brilliant autumn day,
And the breeze has blown away
All the clouds that lowered gray,
So methinks,
As I 've half an hour to spare,
I will go and take the air,
While the weather still is fair,
On the Links.
I admire the splendid view,
The delicious azure hue
Of the ocean and—when, whew!
With a crack,
Lo! there drops a little ball
Which elects to break its fall
By alighting on the small
Of my back.
In the distance some one cries
Some remark about my eyes,
None too pleasant, I surmise,
From the tone;
So away my steps I turn
Till a figure I discern,
Who is xnouching by the burn
All alone.
He has lost a new " Eclipse,"
And a little word that slips
From his sulky-looking lips
Tells me true
That, besides the missing ball,
Which is gone beyond recall,
He has lost—what's worst of all-
Temper too.
I conclude it will be best
If I leave him unaddressed,
Such a melancholy quest
To pursue;
And I pass to where I spy
Clouds of sand uprising high
Till they all but hide the sky
From the view.
They proceed, I understand,
From a bunker full of sand,
Where a golfer, club in hand,
Freely swears
As he hacks with all his might,
Till his countenance is quite
As vermilion as the bright
Coat he wears.
I observe him for a while
With a highly-tickled smile,
For it is the queerest style
Ever seen:

STUDIES IN ANIMAL LIFE.
THE STORK AS HE IIIGHT HAVE BEEN.
He is very short and stout,
And he knocks the ball about,
But he never gets it out
On the green.
Still I watch him chop and hack,
Till I hear a sudden crack,
And the club-head makes a track
In the light—
There's a startled cryol "FORE!"
As it flies, and all is «'er!—
I remember nothing more
Till to-night,
When I find myself in bed
With a lump upon mv head
Like a penny loaf of bread;
And methinks,
For the future I '11 take care,
When I want a little air,
That I won't go anywhere
Near the Links.
THE DILEMMA OF THE
HEADLESS SPECTRE.
I'VE always done my best to
please,
Then wherefore do they scoff'?
A headless ghost, in days like
these,
Is very badly off.
Some say, for MYEBS we ought
to go,
And some for Mr. STEAD.
I really can't profess to know,
For I have lost my head.
They come and ask me for a key
To life's dark prison cell.
Oh, what's the use of asking me'?
However can / tell r*
I do not understand the speech
Of all these learned men.
Wildly I wave my hand at each,
Again and yet again.
I feel that I have stayed too late,
And yet I can't move on.
I 'm utterly inadequate,
Because my head is gon".
I wish I were I don't know what.
I wish that I were dead.
I don't know if I am or not,
For I have lost my head!
1X8 AND OUTS.
"CRICKET was a far superior game to golf
or tennis," said Lord KNTJTSFOHD to the mem-
bers of the Victoria Park Cricket Association;
and he went on to tell a story of the first
introduction of cricket to Tonga, one of the
Pacific Islands. Everybody took up the game
so heartily that State affairs were allowed to
slide altogether, and at last the Kin$ of TONGA
bad to lay down rules as to the times when
the game might be indulged in. "Even then
the Prime Minister was with difficulty pre-
vented from bowling during forbidden hours."
For Tonga read Westminster—where a good
deal of tongue—ah!—goes on—and we get a
result something like this:—
"After the usual luncheon interval, the
Leader of the Opposition and the ex-Umpire-
General faced the delivery- of the First Com-
missioner of Stumps and the Scorin' Secretary.
The punishment inflicted by the former on the
bowling led to a Cabinet crisis, ending in tie
Secretary of State resigning his office and the
leather to the Lord High Wicket-keep. The
result of this change was soon apparent, for
the Leader of the Opposition was clean bowled
was taken by a prominent member from below
the Opposition Gangway.
"As the score still mounted, the Ministry
decided to apply the Closure to the game, an
effort which was resisted by the whole force
of the Opposition, armed with pads and
wickets. During the all-night innings which
ensued the Prime Minister retired hurt, and
the Ministry were finally driven into the Pavi-
lion, where they expressed a decided intention,
in consequence of the underhand bowling of
their opponents, of at once appealing to the
country. The Committee of Lords' has placed
its veto on these disorderly proceedings, and
'Down with the Lords' is likely to be the
Ministerial rallying-cry during the forth-
coming Election.

And lay her tribute laurel on his bier.

THE ART OF NAVAL PLATITUDE.
ME. PUNCH,—Dear Sir,—As an able-bodied seaman and expert on
the marine serpent and other such questions of the hour, I have been
very properly asked for my opinion on the late collisions in the far
K;i-l. Lest my utterances should be misrepresented by journals un-
accustomed to deal with refinements of maritime phraseology, I send
you a correct report of my interview.
"What deduction," began the reporter from the recesses of a
deck-chair that
had figured at
Trafalgar, "do
you make with
regard to the
future of naval
warfare from the
engagements o f
which we have
lately read such
distracting ac-
counts?"
"My leading
deduction," I re-
plied, "is that it
is difficult before-
hand to conjecture
which side is go-
ing to win, and
impossible after-
wards to discover which has actually won. History, nowever, and a
long course of technical experience, alike convince me that, given
equal courage and skill on both sides, vessels equally well equipped
and armoured and of precisely similar shape, tonnage, and fighting
power, victory may be expected, in many cases out of a few more,
to fall to the party that is numerically the stronger of the ttco. You
are. perhaps, with me on this point'{"
'I confess," he replied, "that you throw for me a new and lurid
light on a question always difficult for the lay mind to grapple with.
But tell me of the torpedo and its mission."
"The deadliness," I said, "of this modern weapon of naval war-
fare is to be fully appreciated by such alone as have been its unhappy
victims. In the incredibly short space of time between the moment
of impact and the decease of those who are, as an immediate result,
blown to indistinguishable atoms, no reliable evidence has, in the
nature pf things, been taken down from the lips of the people best
qualified to submit it.
"Disconnected fragments of speech, chiefly of a profane character,
constitute the sole testimony upon which we have to base our con-
clusions. But we may safely affirm that one of the most, if not
the most, important detail in the manipulation of this projectile
is the aim. Wrongly directed it is comparatively innocuous. In the
unavoidable hurry and confusion of the moment, when the attention
of the operator is diverted by the reiterated play of missiles upon his
person, possibly a prey at the very time to insufferable nausea, it is
almost impossible to guarantee the missile from aberration. You
will pardon my technicalities?"
"I thank you," he replied, "and I follow you. But in what way
do you account for the success of the Japanese with these submarine
weapons P"
"Peruse the reports," I answered, "and draw your own deduc-
tions. 'On the morning of the ISlh' (the morrow of the battle) ' the
Japanese flotilla of torpedo-boats returned to the Yalu and leisurely
destroyed with torpedoes sereral stranded Chinese vessels.'
"Here we have the best conceivable endorsement of my views.
That which in the excitement of the fray they were impotent to
achieve, this, with fitting leisure, unhampered by the annoyance of
hostile opposition, and with the object rigidly fixed, as in a vice,
they effected with unqualified and unquestioned success."
Dazzled by my reflections he proceeded to put a fresh conun-
drum to me. "What say you," he asked, "to the resources of
China? I see that the Dowager Empress has sent three millions of
taels to the forces."
"The tael," I explained, "is excellent eating. I perceive no
immediate reason for the evacuation of Peking as far as the supply
of game is concerned. This, however, is a side issue, and not strictly
nautical in its bearing.
"To proceed at once, and in conclusion, to the matter of our own
naval supremacy" (for I saw this inevitable question already framed
on his lips), " I will give you in a word the accumulated wisdom of
long years of naval intuition. My motto is ' Always win!'
) Once let the enemy, however inferior, win, and for the time
being you are beaten. We are—and here I rely not only on my own
observation, but on the testimony of countless myriads of my species
—tee are an insular nation. 'Further, our commerce is largely
dependent on our merchandise. It was not till I had realised to the
conclusion which I have already imparted to you, and now venture
to repeat—' Alwat/s win!' You bear me out, I imagine?"
"I bear myself," he affably replied; thus concluding an inter-
view in the course of which there had been no manner of hitch except
the usual nautical one at the moment of his coming aboard; and that
was due not to the absence of braces, but to respect for my position
as an Admiralty Crichton.
There, Mr. Punch, you are welcome to make any use you will of
a statement that contains practically and tactically the final word
on the future of naval warfare.
Crede, dear Sir, Yours unusually EXPEETO.

THE PARLIAMENTARY FLYING MACHINE.
Maxim—"KEEP IT UP I"
THE CHRONICLES OF A RURAL
PARISH.
I. — FONS ET ORIOO MALI.
nestling in a cosy corner of Blank-
shire — that county which at different times
and places has travelled all over England —
our village pursues the even tenor of its way.
To be accurate, I should say did pursue,
before the events that have recently hap-
pened — events in which it would be absurd
modesty not to confess I have played a nro-
minent part. Now we are as full of excite-
ment as aforetime we were given over to
monotony. Nout aroits - No! J'ai
fhani/e lout cela.
It came about in this way. I have always
till the 2;Jth of September (a chronicler should
always be up to dates) been entirely free from
any ambition to excel in public. After a
successful life I have settled down with my
wife and family to the repose of a truly rural
existence. "You should come down and live
in the country," I am never tired of telling
my friends. "Good air, beautiful milk, and,
bes-t of all, fresh eggs." I don't know why,
but you are always expected to praise the
country eggs. So I always make a point of
doing it.
Up to September the 25th, accordingly, I
extolled the eggs of the country and lived
my simple, unpretending life. On that day
I read an article in the paper on the Parish
Councils Act. I read that now for the first
time the people in the villages would taste
the sweets of local self-government. The
change from fresh eggs struck my fancy, up
to that time singularly dormant. I read on,
dashing all unknowing to my fate. "It is
the duty," I saw, "of every man of educa-
tion, experience, and leisure in the village
who has the welfare of his country at heart
to study the Act, and to make it his business
that his fellow-parishioners shall know what
the Act does, and how the greatest advan-
tage can be obtained from its working."
Then my evil genius prompted me to under-
take the task myself. I was educated—did
I not get a poll degree at Cambridge, ap-
proved even by Mr. CHAHLES WHIBI.EY as a
test of culture? I had experience—had I
not shone as a financial light in the City for
full twenty years Y I had leisure—for had I
anything in the world to do? Obviously the
occasion had come, and I—yes I—was the
man to rise to it.
I bought twenty-nine works dealing with
the Act. I studied them diligently section by
section, clause by clause, line by line. I re-
ferred to all the Acts mentioned. 1 investi-
gated all the Acts repealed. At the end of
it all I felt like a collection of conundrums.
But I was not to be denied. One evening,
as I was walking through the village, I met
ROBERT HKDOKR, "Black BOB," as he is
always called. He is a farm hand, and for
some reason looked upon as a leader of men
in the village. I saw my chance, and promptly
took it.
"Good evening, BOB," I said. "I 've been
wanting to have a bit of a talk with you about
this Parish Councils Act."
"Well, Sir, and what about that?" Of
course he spoke in dialect, but the dialect
dialogues are almost played out, so I trans-
late into quite ordinary English. It's easier
to understand, and quite as interesting.
"What about it?" said I, with well-simu-
lated surprise. Then I launched into a glowing
account of what it would effect. I waxed
poetic. The agricultural labourer would
come home at night from his work proud in
the consciousness of being a citizen. He
would breathe a different air; the very fire
in his cottage would burn brighter because
a Parish Council had been established in his
midst. I finished (it was a distinct anti-
climax) by saying that I had been carefully
studying the Act.
Two days later Black BOB and two of his
mates called at my house—a deputation to
ask me to speak at a meeting, to explain the
Act. I pleaded modestv, and, saying I would
ne'er consent, consented. It was a vain thing
to have done, and the effects have been start-
ling. But that meeting must have a chapter
to itself.
ROBERT'S SOLLEM ADWISE.
I CARNT on airth think what is the matter
with me lately. I seems to have lost all my
good sperrits, and am as quiet and as mopish
as if I was out of a sitiation, which in course
I am not, and am not at all likely to be. My
wife bothers me by constent inquiries about
the comin change on the 9th, out she ort
to no, as I noes, that the cumming new LORD
MABE is jest the same good, kind, afabel Gent
as the noble Gent as is a going afore him,
and who ewery body loved and respected, and
who allers snowed me ewery posserbel kind-
ness. I aint not at all sure as them wunder-
ful Gents as calls theirselves Countv Count-
sellers, and is allcrs a throwing their ill-
natured jeers at the grand old Citty, hasn't
sumthink to do with it. I 'm told as they has
acshally ordered one of our most poplar
Theaters to be shut up, becoz the acters and
actresses is so werry atracktive that they
draws a wunderful contrast between them
and the sollem Gents as is allers a interfeer-
ing in some way or other where they are
least wanted.
One of their most wunderful and most con-
ceeted fads is a longing desire to have charge
of our nobel Citty Perlice, which, as ewery
body knos, is the pride of the hole Me-
trolypus.
One of the new LORD MAKE'S private gennel-
men has told me, in the werry strictest con-
iidens, that they have all agreed together,
LOHD MARE, Sherryfs, Halldermen, Livery-
men, and setterer, to have the most brillientest
Show as has bin seen in the old Citty since
the time of DICK WITTTNGTON of ewarlasting
memory! if its ony for the purpose of driving
the County Countsellers, as they calls their-
selves, stark staring mad with enwy! And
so estonished is the Queen's Guvemment
themselves by what they hears on the subjec
of the glorious approchmg Dinner, that they
has acshally ordered the werry primest of
all their Cabinet lot, inclooding the Prime
Minister hisself, and the Lord Chanceseller,
and my Lord SPINSTER,
and setterer and set-
terer, not only to accept
the LORD MARE'S per-
lite inwitation, but to
take care to be in good
time, and not to keep
the nobel company wait-
ing as old Mr. GLED-
STONE usued to do in
days gorn by.
By-the-by, the pre-
sent LORD MARE, jest to
show his ermazin libber-
ality, acshally arsked
jest a few of the
County Countsellers to
his larst great bankwet
larst week, and werry
much they seemed to injoy theirselves, and I
must say, behaived like reel gennelmen, tho'
sum of the speeches, speshally them by Lord
HAILSBERY and Mr. RICHER, must have been
rayther staggerers for them to bear.

[" Of course, you may get the House of Lords to surrender as you

and besieged beyond all hope of deliverance; but that in iUelf is not
an easy task with the garrison that 1 hare described as sure to defend

Sir Lucim. Ay, to be sure: what can I mean else ? . . . I think he
ha« given you the greatest provocation in the world.
Acres. Gad, that's true—I grow full of anger, Sir Lucres!—I fire
apace! Odds hilts and blades! I find a man may have a deal of valour
in him and not know it! ... Tour words are a grenadier's match to

a kind of valour rising as it were—a kind of courage a« I may say.—
Odds flints, pans and triggers! I'll challenge him directly !—The

ODDS bombs and torpedoes! An oath, like a whistle.
Will keep up the courage—Dutch courage at least!
I feel like a hero of grandeur and gristle
Who goes to the fight as men go to a feast.
Sir Lucius has wrought me to't—fire-eater furious.
Odds bullets and blades, how he '11 bristle and whisk!
Yes, courage is catching. And yet—it is curious,
He urges the task without weighing the risk.
That's just like O'TBIGGEB, a swaggering swigger
Of fiery potheen which gets into his head!
At patience and caution he '11 swear or he '11 snigger,
His only resources steel, powder and lead.
He thinks he has managed the business most cleverly,
Bull-making bully of Blunderbuss Hall;
But zounds. That big burly and black-bearded—BEVEC-
LKT,
Is not a foe to pooh pooh! Not at all!
Odds jigs and tabors! Such bellicose neighbours
Are horridly awkward; they will force one's hand,
A chap who unceasingly brags and belabours
Is valued, no doubt, in a Donnybrook band;
But swelling Drawcansir demeanour won't answer
On this bide the Channel so well as on lhat.

Leads all his friends into mischief and row.
Still, I 'm committed; and much to be pitied,
As clearly they 'd see if they had any nous.
But odds popguns and peashooters! shall I be twitted
With caution extreme, and the pluck of a mouse?
No, that will not do. I my courage must muster.
Whatever the odds, FIGHTING BOB must show fight!
So here goes a buster, though bluster and fluster
Are not in my line; yet " indite, Sirs, indite I"
I 41 begin with a—swear-word and end with defiance!
Odds daggers and darts, how I '11 hector and frown!
My friends on my valour may now place reliance,
The challenge is sent, Sirs, the gauntlet is down!!!

WITHIN the Square we both abide,
An artist I, an heiress you,
My studio like my work is skied,
'Tis sitting-room and studio too.
Your chimney-pots I can descry,
I look across the leafy Square.
I think of you, I wonder why
Your uncle is a millionaire!
I 've pictured you in chalks and oils,
I like you best in misty grey,
Your nameless charm my pencil
spoils,
Yet strives for ever to portray.
By day I turn you to the wall
Lest idle gazers el ould surprise;
But when night gathers I recall,
I look into your dreaming eyes.
So many things I cared about,
And now they all have fallen flat,
While I, Bohemian out and out,
Have been to buy a better hat,
In lieu of one of dusky green
Upon my coat paint splashes shine.
Endeavouring to get it clean
I 've rubbed it hard with turpen-
tine
Till my head ached, my heart was
faint,
And I was utterly undone,
I cannot rub away the paint,
I can't afford another one.
They have a murky yellow shade,
My collars once so white; and
frail,
And at the wristbands sadly frayed
My solitary swallow-tail I
That dinner-party where we met!
We seemed to meet like friends of
old,
And both to utterly forget
Oh, by your eyes, your wistful mien,
I know for wealth you do not care,
I know you wish you had not been
Related to a millionaire!
The starlit night is deepening,
Hushed are the footsteps of the
folk,
My window open wide I fling,
And one enchanted pipe I smoke,
And on the misty vapour blue,
Across the Square my fancies float;
And oh, so near, so near to you,
And oh, so bitterly remote!
I talk to you of many things,
My pipe I unaware refill,
I wonder if our thoughts have wings,
1 wonder, are you waking still?
And should I, if your house took
fire,
Have time to hurry to your aid,
To rescue you from peril dire,
Before swooped down the Fire
Brigade.
There las sprung up a pleasant
breeze
After the day's dustladen air,
And it is blowing in the trees

tell.

And bid her dream I love her well!

FEMINA DUX FACTI.
The Tumulus, Parliament Hill, Nor. 5.
DEAU MR. PUNCH,-—Do not confuse me with a boa-constrictor
story. Cursed be he that disturbs my bona fides; and the above is
my real address.
True, the ancient Romans knew me as the Old Pretendress, bul
let that pass. What I want to know is this. Will nothing check
the energy of the L. C. C. ?—nothing allay their fever for expurga-
tion? I am not a Promenader. I only ask to lie still. Nor a Living
Picture either, and have not been for more than eighteen centuries.
Talk of Roman noses! Why their eagle was a chicken compared
with the London Carrion Crows! Such a power of scent!
It is Guy Fawkcs day, and I hear talk of blowing up the Lords.
But surely one must draw the line somewhere this side of an insidious
exhumation of the Monarchy!
After all, if they do get at my bones, the real marrow of me has
transmigrated into the New Woman. Sir, there were New Women
in my day. We invented everything. I see the Daily Telegraph
says they have found a pellet. That reminds me that after the
death of my late husband, PKASCTAGUS, King of the Iceni (not to be
confused with the PLIOCEXI of about the same period), I was subjected
to the most revolting barbarity at the hands of the Veterans (their
name was legionary), and I was obliged to invent a pellet-proof
corset.
Then, again, we held all the commissions in the army. How does
TACITUS report my famous speech to the Queen Consort's Own
Regiment of Pioneers (new style)?" Vincendum ilia acie rel caden-
dum esse. Id mulieri destinatum. Viverent riri et servirent." Let
the men live on in slavery! What a prophetic utterance!
By the way, not many Emancipated Women of the present day
could speak better Latin than that. Indeed, we took all the
University degrees. I myself was an honorary felo de se.
Don't tell me that I am prehistoric, and that TACITUS was a forger
of the fourteenth century. No testimony is sacred now-a-days, not
even the most profane!
I conclude with a passage from Madame SARAH GRAY, which I
think comes in rather well.
Beneath, this storied hump there lies concealed
A heart once pregnant with a Righteous Plan,
Hands that the rod of Empire used to wield,
And whacked to ecstasy the human Man.
Dear Mr. Punch, may you live for ever; or, failing that, may no
rude spoiler mar your "animated bust." Excuse these disjointed
remarks, but I am writing in a barrow.
Yours, in the spirit, BOADICEA.
P.S.—I have thought of a proverb. New Women should be put
1
A GAY WIDOW COURTED.
NOTHING could be better than the acting all'round [in Jthe new
three-act play at the Court. It is distinctly first-rate, and those
who want a hearty laugh should proceed to the Court to enjoy it
And yet there is also serious relief, as there should be—light anc
shade. First there is Miss LOTTIE YENNE, who shows us that she
can mingle pathos with comedy, temper smiles with tears. She is as
bright as sunshine in the comic scenes, anc
when she has to say good-bye to her newly-
married daughter, she glides from peals oi
merriment into sobs of sorrow that are in-
tensely touching because they are intensely
natural. Then Mr. HAWTREY, in a parl
that fits him down to the ground (in the
Stalls) and up to the ceiling (in the Gallery),
is greatly amusing. And he, too, has ins
more mournful moments. People accus-
tomed to seeing this accomplished actor in
butterfly touch-and-go parts would scarcely
credit him with the power of becoming
pathetically unmanned. And yet so it is.
Mr. HAWTBEY, indignant at a false accusa-
tion emanating from his wife, commences a
letter full of angry reproaches, addressed to her solicitors, and gradu-
ally forgets everything in his despairing appeal for the love he craves
but which he fears he has lost. Nothing better than this has been
seen for a long time in a London theatre. Then Mr. GILBERT HARE
(inheritor of his father's cleverness) causes roars of laughter by his
comical sketch of a man with a cold. But here, again, the mirth is
tempered with sympathy. The echo of the " ha, ha, ha," in spite of its
inappropriateness, is " Poor fellow!" Mr. THOHXE, too, is good, and
so is Mr. RIGHTON, and so is everyone concerned.

FINISHING TOUCHES.
['' Canon FUBSE said he believed no man's education was complete who
did not attend public meetings."—Daily JVnrs.]
MY classics were not shaky, nor my mathematics weak,
My great linguistic fluency enabled me to speak
In half-a-dozen languages with quite surprising skill,
And yet—I always felt it—there was something lacking still.
But, though profoundly conscious of a lingering defect,
The cause of imperfection I was puzzled to detect,
But Canon FURSE explains it; for I sorrow to relate,
I shunned all public meetings, which accounted fur my state.
Well, over chances past and t >
gone, 'twere idle to shed tears,
I'm striving now to rectify the
fault of former years,
And every afternoon and night I
rush from street to street,
Endeavouring to make my edu-
cation more " complete.
Where Anti-Yivisectionists their
armaments encamp.
Where Democrats democratise,
and stage-reformers ramp,
Where fervent Ulstermen point
out that MORIEY is a fool,
Where Parnellites insist upon
the beauty of Home Rule;
Where lecturers with lanterns make the vice of drinking clear,
Where publicans prove amply that our only hope is beer,—
To each and all of these I come, a champion of the cause,
And sit imbibing wisdom, and I join in the applause;
I join in the applause, and—yes! The Anti-Smoking cranks
Invited me, not long ago, to move a vote of thanks!
Ah, happy, happy moment, when I stood, composed but proud.
And looked at Mr. Chairman, and the hushed, expectant crowd!
Yes, Canon FURSE, I thank you for your warning so discreet;
Indeed, our education now is wholly incomplete
Unless we meet and " sympathise," "insist on," and " deplore,"

LYRE AND LANCET.
(A Story in Scenes.)
PART XIX.-UNEARNED INCREMENT.
SCENE XXVII. (continued).—The Chinese Drawing Room.
Sir Rupert (to TREDWKLL). Well, what is it P
Tredwett (in an undertone]. With reference to the party. Sir
RUPEBT, as represents himself to have come down to see the 'orse,
Sir Rup. (aloud). You mean Mr. SPUEBELL? It's all right.
Mr. SPITRRELL will see the horse to-morrow. (TBEDWELL disguises
his utter bewilderment.) By the way, we expected a Mr. • What
did you say the name was, my dear ? . . . UNDERSHELL? To be
sure, a Mr. UNDERSHELL, to have been here in time for dinner. Do
you know why he has been unable to come before this?
Tred. (to himself). Do I know? Oh, Lor!
believe he have arrived, Sir RDPEHT.
Sir Rup. So I understand from Mr. SPURKELL.
Tred. He is, Sir RUPERT. I—I considered it my dooty not to allow
him to leave the house, not feeling
Sir Rup. Quite right, TREDWELL.
I should have been most seriously
annoyed if I had found that a guest
we were all anxiously expecting had left
the Court, owing to some fancied
Where is he now?
Tred. (faintly). In—in the Verney
Chamber. Leastwavs
Sir Rap. Ah. (tie glances at SPUR-
RBLL.) Then where ?But that can
be arranged. Go up and explain to Mr.
UNDEBSHELL that we have only this
moment heard of his arrival; say we
understand that he has been obliged
to come by a later train, and that we
shall be delighted to see him, just as
he is.
Spurrell (to himself). He was worth
looking at just as he teas, when Jsaw
him!
Tred. Very good, Sir RUPERT. (To
himself, as he depart*.) If I 'm not
precious careful over this job, it may
cost me my situation!
Spurr. Sir RUPKBT, Fve been think-
ing that, after what's occurred, it
would probably be more satisfactory to
all parties if I shifted my quarters,
and—and took my meals in the House-
keeper's Room. [Lady MAISIE and
Lady RHODA utter inarticulate pro-
tests.
Sir Rup. My dear Sir, not on any
account—couldn't hear of it! My wife,
I 'm sure, will-say the same.
Lady C'ulcerin (with an effort). I
hope Mr. SPURREI.L will continue to
be our guest precisely as before—that
is, if he will forgive us for putting
him into another room
Spun: (to himseff). It's no use; I
cant get rid of 'em • they stick to me like a lot of highly-bred burrs!
(Aloud, in despair.} Your ladyship is very good, but Well,
the fact is, I 've only just found out that a young lady I 've long
been deeply attached to is in this very house. She's a Miss EMMA
PHILLIPSON—maid, so I understand, to Lady MAISIE—and, without
for one moment wishing to draw any comparisons, or to seem un-
grateful for all the friendliness I've received, I really and truly
would feel mvself more comfortable in a circle where I could enjoy
rather more of my EMMA'S society!
Sir Rup. (immensely relieved). Perfectly natural! and—hum
—sorry as we are to lose you, Mr. SPPRBELL, we—ah—mustn't
be inconsiderate enough to keep you here a moment longer. I
daresay you will find the young lady in the Housekeeper's
Room—anyone will tell you where it is. ... Good-night to you,
then: and, remember, we shall expect to see you in the field on
Tuesday.
Lady Maisie. Good-night, Mr. SPURRELL, and—and I 'm so very
glad—about EMMA, you know. I hope you will both be very happy.
[She shaken hands warmly.
Lady Rhoda. So do I. And mind you don't forget about that
liniment, you know.
Captain Thicknesse (to himself). MAISIE don't care a hang! And
SCENE XXVIII.—The Verney Chamber.
Undershell (in the dressing-room, to himself). I wonder how long
I've been locked up here—it seems hours! I almost hope they've
forgotten me altogether. . . . Someone has come in. ... If it should
be Sir RUPERT!! Great Heavens, what a situation to be found in
by one's host! . . . Perhaps it's only that fellow SPURRELL; if so,
there's a chance. (The duor is unlocked by THEDWELL, icho has
lighted the candles on the dressing-table.) It's the butler again.
Well, I shall soon know the worst! (lie steps out, blinking, with as
much dignity as possible.) Perhaps you will kindly inform me why
I have been subjected to this indignity?
Tred. (in perturbation). I think Mr. UNDERSHELL, Sir, in common
fairness, you'll admit as you've mainly yourself to thank for any
mistakes that have occurred; for which I 'asten to express my
pussonal regret.
Und. So long as you realise that you have made a mistake, I am
(Aloud.) I—I willing to overlook it, on condition that you help me to get away
from this place without your master and mistress's knowledge.
Is he here still? Tred. It's too late, Sir. They know you 're 'ere!
1'nd. They know!

"I 'm so very glad—about Emma, you know!"
'you
Then there's no time to be lost. I must leave
this moment!
Tred. No, Sir, excuse me; but you
can't hardly do that now. I was to
say that Sir RUPERT and the_ ladies
would be glad to see you in the
Droring Room himmediate.
Und. Man alive! do you imagine
anything would induce me to meet
them now, after the humiliations I
have been compelled to suffer under
this roof?
Tred. If you would prefer anything
that has taken place in the Room, Sir,
or in the stables to be 'ushed up
Und Prefer it! If it were only
possible! But they know—they know!
What's the use of talking like that?
Tred. (to himself). I know where I
am now! (Aloud.) They know nothink
up to the present, Mr. UNDERSHELL,
nor vet I see no occasion why they
should—leastwise from any of Ut.
Und. But they know I 'm here; how
am I to account for all the time?
Tred. Excuse me. Sir. I thought of
that, and it occurred to me as it might
be more agreeable to your feelings, Sir,
if I conveyed an impression that you
had only just arrived—'aving missed
your train, Sir.
Uiid. (overjoyed). How am I to
thank you 1 that was really most dis-
creet of you—most considerate!
Tred. I am truly rejoiced to hear
you say BO, Sir. And I'll take care
nothing leaks out. And if you'll be
kind enough to follow me to the Droring
Room, the ladies arc waiting to see
you.
Und. (to himself). I may actually
meet Lady MAISIE MULL after all!
(Aloud, recollecting his condition.)
I 'm in such a horrible mess!
But I can't go down like this.
Tred. I reelly don't perceive it. Sir; there's a little white on your
coat-oollar behind. Allow me—there, it's off now. (He gives him a
hand-glass.) If you 'd like to see for yourself.
Und. (to himself as he looks). A little pallor, that's all. I am
more presentable than I could have hoped. (Aloud.) Have the
kindness to take me to Lady CULVERTS at once.
SCENE XXIX.—The Chinese Drawing Room.
A few minutes later.
Sir Rup. (to UNDERSHELL, after the introductions have been gone
through). And so you missed the 4.55 and had to come on by the 7.30,
which stops everywhere, eh?
Und. It—it certainly does stop at most stations.
Sir Rup. And how did you get on to Wyvern—been here long f
Und. N-not particularly long.
Sir Rup. Fact is, you see, we made a mistake. Very ridiculous,
but we've been taking that young fellow, Mr. SPURRELL, for
you all this time; so we never thought of inquiring whether
you'd come or not. It was only just now he told us how he'd
met you in the Verney Chamber, and the very handsome way,
if you will allow me to say BO, in which you had tried to efface

FEMINA DUX PACTI.
The Tumulus, Parliament Hill, Nov. 5.
DEAU MR. PUNCH,—Do not confuse me with a boa-constrictor
story. Cursed be he that disturbs my bona fides; and the above is
my real address.
True, the ancient Romans knew me as the Old Pretendress, but
let that pass. What I want to know is this. Will nothing check
the energy of the L. C. C. ?—nothing allay their fever for expurga-
tion? I am not a Promenader. I only ask to lie still. Nor a Living
Picture either, and have not been for more than eighteen centuries.
Talk of Roman noses! Why their eagle was a chicken compared
with the London Carrion Crows! Such a power of scent!
It is Guy Fawkcs day, and I hear talk of blowing up the Lords.
But surely one must draw the line somewhere this side of an insidious
exhumation of the Monarchy!
After all, if they do get at my bones, the real marrow of me has
transmigrated into the New Woman. Sir, there were New Women
in my day. We invented everything. I see the Daily Telegraph
Etiys they have found a pellet. That reminds me that after the
death of my late husband, PRASUTAOCS, King of the Iceni (not to be
confused with the PLIOCEXI of about the same period), I was subjected
to the most revolting barbarity at the hands of the Veterans (their
name was legionary), and I was obliged to invent a pellet-proof
corset.
Then, again, we held all the commissions in the army. How does
TACITUS report my famous speech to the Queen Consort's Own
Regiment of Pioneers (new style)? "Vincendum ilia acie relcaden-
dum esse. Id mulieri deslinatum. Virerent t'iri et serrirent." Let
the men live on in slavery! What a prophetic utterance!
By the way, not many Emancipated Women of the present day
could speak better Latin than that. Indeed, we took all the
University degrees. I myself was an honorary felo de te.
Don't tell me that I am prehistoric, and that TACITUS was a forger
of the fourteenth century. No testimony is sacred now-a-days, not
even the most profane!
I conclude with a passage from Madame SAHAII GHAT, which I
think comes in rather well.
Beneath, this storied hump there lies concealed
A heart once pregnant with a Righteous Plan,
Hands that the rod of Empire used to wield,
And whacked to ecstasy the human Man.
Dear Mr. Punch, may you live for ever; or, failing that, may no
rude spoiler mar your "animated bust." Excuse these disjointed
remarks, but I am writing in a barrow.
Yours, in the spirit, BOAJUCEA.
P.S.—I have thought of a proverb. New Women should be put
A GAY WIDOW COURTED.
NOTHING could be better than the acting all-round [in Jthe new
three-act play at the Court. It is distinctly first-rate, and those
who want a hearty laugh should proceed to the Court to enjoy it.
And yet there is also serious relief, as there should be—light anc
shade. First there is Miss LOTTIE VENNE, who shows us that she
can mingle pathos with comedy, temper smiles with tears. She is as
bright as sunshine in the comic scenes, and
when she has to say good-bye to her newly-
married daughter, she glides from peals oJ
merriment into sobs of sorrow that are in-
tensely touching because they are intensely
natural. Then Mr. HAWTRET, in a part
that fits him down to the ground (in the
Stalls) and up to the ceiling (in the Gallery},
is greatly amusing. And he, too, has hit
more mournful moments. People accus-
tomed to seeing this accomplished actor in
butterfly touch-and-go parts would scarcely
credit him with the power of becoming
pathetically unmanned. And yet so it is.
Mr. HAWTHEY, indignant at a false accusa-
tion emanating from his wife, commences a
letter full of angry reproaches, addressed to her solicitors, and gradu-
ally forgets everything in his despairing appeal for the love he craves
but which he fears he has lost. Nothing better than this has been
seen for a long time in a London theatre. Then Mr. GILBERT HARE
(inheritor of his father's cleverness) causes roars of laughter by his
comical sketch of a man with a cold. But here, again, the mirth is
tempered with sympathy. The echo of the '' ha, ha, ha," in spite of its
inappropriateness, is " Poor fellow!" Mr. THORNE, too, is good, and
so is Mr. RIGHTON, and so is everyone concerned.

FINISHING TOUCHES.
["Canon FUBSE said he believed no man's education was complete who
did not attend public meetings."—Daily Nnct.]
MY classics were not shaky, nor my mathematics weak,
My great linguistic fluency enabled me to speak
In half-a-dozen languages with quite surprising skill,
And yet—I always felt it—there was something lacking still.
But, though profoundly conscious of a lingering defect,
The cause of imperfection I was puzzled to detect,
But Canon FUHSE explains it; for I sorrow to relate,
I shunned all public meetings, which accounted fur my state.
Well, over chances past and
gone, 'twere idle to shed tears,
I'm striving now to rectify the
fault of former years,
And every afternoon and night I
rush from street to street,
Endeavouring to make my edu-
cation more " complete.
Where Anti-Vivisectionists their
armaments encamp.
Where Democrats democratise,
and stage-reformers ramp,
Where fervent Ulstermen point
out that MORLEY is a fool,
Where Parnellites insist upon
the beauty of Home Rule;
Where lecturers with lanterns make the vice of drinking clear,
Where publicans prove amply that our only hope is beer,—
To each and all of these I come, a champion of the cause,
And sit imbibing wisdom, and I join in the applause;
I join in the applause, and—yes! The Anti-Smoking cranks
Invited me, not long ago, to move a vote of thanks!
Ah, happy, happy moment, when I stood, composed but proud.
And looked at Mr. Chairman, and the hushed, expectant crowd!
Yes, Canon FUHSE, I thank you for your warning so discreet;
Indeed, our education now is wholly incomplete

Earth's mightest autocrat, and yet a man
Unwitched by War's wrath-stirring rataplan!
A phantom haunted thee from the rtd snows
Where with the blood of legions Plevna ran.
Where War took on its deadliest, dreadfullett guhe,
The love of Peace possessed thee. Those closed eyes
Frowned back Bellona's Ion? soliciting.
Peace smiles on them, though lid on lid now lies.
Peace smiles in love, and weeps in true lament,
Mourner for one who. worn and trouble-bent,
Yet with firm hand held fast the Janus gate
A despot's aid to the dove-carrier lent.
Therefore the hearts of freemen to thee warmed

How oft with anguish those stern eyes were wet?

Of what avail to solace, gladden, bless?
From wife's endearment or from child's caress
Starting dread-shaken, Power sees danger lurk,

WHAT His LOBDSHIP MUST HAVE SAID.—A juryman in a recent
case objected to a private soldier, who is a public servant, being de-
scribed as "one of the lower classes." The LOUD CHIEF JUSTICE
expjained that the witness had said "rough classes," not "lower,"
adding his dictum that "patent leather boats do not make a man
first class." This remark was a pro/Mm de biittes; and what the
Chief meant to say was evidently that "patent leather boots were
not to be considered as a patent of nobility." When FBANK LOCK-
WOOD, Q.C., M.P., Attorney-General, heard of it, he wept as for
another good chance gone for ever.
CAUGHT PUNNING.—In some of the theatrical items for the we«k
we see it announced that a certain playwright is at work on a comic
opera which has for its subject Manon Letcaut. "If it is to be a
travestie," observed "W. A.," the World's Archer, who makes a
shot at a pun whenever the chance is given him, then its title
should of course be ' Manon Bur-Lescaut.'"
"REFORM IN CONVEYANCING."—Certainly, a reform much needed.
Let us have some new Hansoms which are not "bone-shakers" and
whose windows will not act as so many guillotines. Some imnroved

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE DECADENT GUYS.
(A Colour-Study in Onen Carnations.)
THEY were sitting close together in their characteristic attitudes;
the knees slightly limp, and the arms hanging loosely by their sides;
Lord RAGGIE TATTEBSAII, in the peculiar kind of portable chair he
most affected; FUSTIAN FLITTERS in a luxurious sort of hand-
barrow. The lemon-tinted November light of a back street in a London
slum floated lovingly on their collapsed forms, and on the great mass of
weary cabbage-stalks that lay dreaming themselves daintily to death
in the gutter at their feet.
They were both dressed very much alike, in loosely-fitting, fan-
tastically patched coats. Lord RAGGIE was wearing a straw hat,
with the crown reticently suggested rather than expressed, which
suited his complexion very well, emphasising, as it did, the white
weariness of his smooth face, with the bright spot of red that had
appeared on each cheek, and the vacant fretfulness of his hollow
eyes; he held his head slightly on one side, and seemed very tired.
FUSTIAN FLITTERS had adopted the regulation chimney-pot hat,
beautiful with the iridescent sheen of decay; he was taller, bulgier,
and bulkier than his friend, and allowed his heavy chin to droop
languidly forward. Both wore white cotton gloves, broken boots,
and rather small magenta cauliflowers in their button-hi 1 -a.
"M v dear RAGGIE," said
Mr. FLITTERS, in a gently
elaborate voice, and with a
gracious wave of his plump
straw-distended white fin-
gers towards his compan-
ion's chair; "you are
looking very well this after-
noon. You would be per-
fectly charming in a red
wig and a cocked-hat, and
achecked ulster with purple
and green shadows in the
folds. You would wear it
beautifully, floating negli-
gently over your shoulders.
But you are wonderfully
complete as you are!"
"That is so true!" ac-
quiesced RAGGIE, with per-
fect complacency. "lam
very beautiful. And you,
FUSTIAN, you are so ener-
getically inert. Are you
going to blow up to-night P
You are so brilliant when
you blow up."
"I have not decided
either way. I never do. It
will depend upon how I
feel in the bonfire. I let it
come if it will. The true
impromptu is invariably
premeditated."
"Isn't that rather self-

"We must give them time. Already they have copied our distinc-
tive costume, caught our very features and colouring. Some day.
FUSTIAN, some day they will adopt our mystic emblem—the symbol
that is such a true symbol in possessing no meaning whatever—the
Magenta Cauliflower I And then—and then ."
"It will be time for Us to drop it," continued Mr. FCSTIAN
FLITTERS, with his pecular smile of inscrutable obviousness.
"Beautiful rose-coloured children!" murmured Lord RAGGIE,
dreamily*; '' how sad to think that thev will all grow up and degenerate
into pork-butchers, and generals, and bishops, and absurdly futile per-
sons of that sort! But listen -it is so sweet of them—they are going to
sinjr an exquisite little catch I composed expressly for them, a sort of
mellifluously raucous chant with no tune in particular. That is
where it is so wonderful. True melody is always quite tuneless!"
One by one the shrill, passionate young voices chimed in, until the
very lamp-posts throbbed and rang with the words, and they seemed to
wander away, away among the sleeping pageant of the chimney-pots,
away to the burnished golden globes of the struggling pawnbroker.
"Please ter remember. The Fifth o' November. For Gun 1'owder 1'lot.
Tor blow up the King and 'is Porliment. Shall never. Bo. Forgot!
'Oiler, Hoys, 'Oiler!"
Lord RAQGTE. with his head bent, listened with a smile parting the
scarlet thread of his lips, a smile in his pretty hollow eyes. "I wonder
why people should be ex-
horted to remember such a
• prosaic and commonplace
crime as that," hemeditated
aloud: "a crime, too, that
had not even the vulgar
merit of being a success!"
"Only failures ever do
succeed, really," said FUS-
TIAN, leaning largely over
his barrow. "How deli-
riously they are joggling

"There is only one
stimulating thing in the
world," was the languid
answer; "and that is a
soporific. But see, FUS-
TIAN, here comes one of
those unconsciously absurd
persons they call policemen.
How stiffly he holds him-

"Of course it is. Does not consistency solely consist in contra-
dicting oneself? But I suppose I «»i a trifle ilecousu."
"You are. Indeed, we are both what those absurd clothes-dealing
Philistines would call ' threadbare '— you and I."
I hope so, most sincerely. There is something so hopelessly
distorted figures. The only
real Adonis nowadays is a
Guy." And the shrill voices of the young choristers, detaching them-
selves one by one from the melodic fabric in which they were enmeshed,
grew fainter and fainter still—until they slipped at last into silence.
FUSTIAN, did you notice? Our rose-white adherents have abandoned
us. They have run away—' done a guy,' as vulgarians express it."
"They have done two," said Mr. FLITTERS correctively; "which

"It seems not. Thev think we are dangerous. How can one

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE DECADENT GUYS.
(A Colour-Study in Oreen Carnations.)
THEY were sitting close together in their characteristic attitudes;
the knees slightly limp, and the arms hanging loosely by their sides;
Lord RAOGIE TATTERSALL in the peculiar kind 9f portable chair he
most affected; FUSTIAN- FLITTKRS in a luxurious sort of hand-
barrow. The lemon-tinted November light of a back street in a London
slum floated lovingly on their collapsed forms, and on the great mass of
weary cabbage-stalks that lay dreaming themselves daintily to death
in the gutter at their feet.
They were both dressed very much alike, in loosely-fitting, fan-
tastically patched coats. Lord RAGGIE was wearing a straw hat,
with the crown reticently suggested rather than expressed, which
suited his complexion very well, emphasising, as it did, the white
weariness of his smooth face, with the bright spot of red that had
appeared on each cheek, and the vacant fretfulness of his hollow
eyes; he held his head slightly on one side, and seemed very tired.
FUSTIAN FLITTERS had adopted the regulation chimney-pot hat,
beautiful with the iridescent sheen of decay; he was taller, bulgier,
and bulkier than his friend, and allowed his heavy chin to droop
languidly forward. Both wore white cotton gloves, broken boots,
and rather small magenta cauliflowers in their button-hi 1 's.
"My dear RAGGIE," said
Mr. FLITTERS, in a gently
elaborate voice, and with a
gracious wave of his plump
straw-distended white fin-
gers towards his compan-
ion's chair; "you are
looking very well this after-
noon. You would be per-
fectly charming in a red
wig and a cocked-hat, and
achecked ulster with purple
and green shadows in the
folds. You would wear it
beautifully, floating negli-
gently over your shoulders.
But you are wonderfully
complete as you are!"
"That is so true!" ac-
quiesced RAGGIE-, with per-
fect complacency. "I am
very beautiful. And you,
FUSTIAN, you are so ener-
getically inert. Are you
going to blow up to-night P
You are so brilliant when
you blow up."
"I have not decided
either way. I never do. It
will depend upon how I
feel in the bonfire. I let it
come if it will. The true
impromptu is invariably
premeditated."
"Isn't that rather self-

contradictory?" said RAGGIE, with his pretty quick smile.
"Of course it is. Does not consistency solely consist in contra-
dicting oneself? But I suppose I am a trifle ileeousu."
"You are. Indeed, we are both what those absurd clothes-dealing
Philistines would call ' threadbare'—you and I."
"We must give them time. Already they have copied our distinc-
tive costume, caught our very features and colouring. Some day,
FUSTIAN, some day they will adopt our mystic emblem—the symbol
that is such a true symbol in possessing no meaning whatever—the
Magenta Cauliflower I And then—and then ."
"It will be time for Us to drop it," continued Mr. FDSTIAN
FLITTERS, with his pecular smile of inscrutable obviousness.
"Beautiful rose-coloured children!" murmured Lord RAGGIE,
dreamily; '' how sad to think that they will all grow up and degenerate
into pork-butchers, and generals, and bishops, and absurdly futile per-
sons of that sort! But listen; it is so sweet of them—they are going to
sing an exquisite little catch I composed expressly for them, a sort of
melliflnously raucous chant with no tune in particular. That is
where it is so wonderful. True melody is always quite tuneless!"
One by one the shrill, passionate young voices chimed in, until the
very lamp-posts throbbed and rang with the words, and they seemed to
wander away, away among the deeping pageant of the chimney-pots,
away to the burnished golden globes of the struggling pawnbroker.
"Please tcr remember. The Fifth p' November. For Gun Powder Plot.
TIT blow up the King and 'is Porliment. Shall never. Be. Forgot!
'Oiler, Boys, 'Oiler!"
Lord RAGGIE, with his head bent, listened with a bmile parting the
scarlet thread of his lips, a smile in his pretty hollow eyes. "I wonder

THE POLITE GUIDE TO THE CIVIL SERVICE.
(By an A'fable Philosopher and
Courteous Friend.)
THE CHOICE OF A PRIVATE SECRETARY.
HAVING explained the mode of entering the
service of the Crown by becoming the Secre-
tary of the Public Squander Department, I
now proceed to consider the best manner in
which you should comport yourself in that
position. The moment it is known that you
have accepted the appointment you will re-
ceive a deluge of letters recommending various
aspiring young gentlemen for the post of
Private Secretary. Of course the notes must
be civilly answered, but on no account pledge
yourself to any one of the writers. And here
I may give what may be termed the golden
rale 9f the service, " always be polite to the
individual in particular, and contemptuous to
the public in general." The tradition of
many generations of oilicials has been to re-
gard outsiders as enemies. There may be
small jealousies in a Government Depart-
ment, but every man in the place will stand
shoulder to shoulder with his fellow to repel
the attacks of non-civilians. And the word
"attack" has many meanings. Practically,
everything is an attack. If an outsider atks
a question, the query is an attack. If an out-
sider complains, the grievance is an attack.
If an outsider begs a favour, the petition is
an attack. If you bear this well in mind,
you cannot go wrong. Adopt it as your
creed, and you may be sure that you will
hn-iinc immediately an ideal head of a
Government Department.
Say that you have accepted your appoint-
ment, and are prepared to take up at once the
duties appertaining to your new position.
No doubt during vfcur "attacks" upon the
Milestones you will have come across several
of the officials of the Public Squander Depart-
ment. So when you arrive in the hall of your
new bureau you will be recognised at once
by most of the messengers. You will be con-
ducted with deference to your new quarters.
You will tind them very comfortable. Any
number of easy-chairs. Large writing-desk.
Several handsome tables. Rich carpet, rugt
to match, and a coal-sonttle with the depart-
mental cypher. On the walls, maps and
some armour. The latter, no doubt, has
come from the Tower, or llolyrood, or Dublin
Castle. Most probably one of your pre-
decessors has given an official dinner in your
room, and the armour is the result of the
importunity of his Private Secretary.
I Kay, TtxTERFORE," vonr predecessor
has observed, "don't you think these wall*-

accepted shall be kept for ever. That is to
say, if it can be clearly proved that the things
retained can be useful somewhere else. You

with effusion the chief clerk. He has been
waiting to receive you. As you dp not know
the ropes, it is advisable to be civil to every
one; Later on, when you have a talented

THE POLITE GUIDE TO THE CIVIL SERVICE.
(By an Affable Philosopher and
Courteous Friend.)
THE CHOICE OF A PRIVATE SECRETARY.
HAVING explained the mode of entering 1he
service of the Crown by becoming the Secre-
tary of the Public Squander Department, I
now proceed to consider the best manner in
which you should comport yourself in that
position. The moment it is known that you
have accepted the appointment you will re-
ceive a deluge of letters recommending various
aspiring young gentlemen for the post of
Private Secretary. Of course the notes must
be civilly answered, but on no account pledge
yourself to any one of the writers. And here
I may give what may be termed the goldeo
rule of the service, "always be polite to the
individual in particular, and contemptuous to
the public in general." The tradition of
many generations of officials has been to re-
gard outsiders as enemies. There may be
small jealousies in a Government Depart-
ment, out every man in the place will stand
shoulder to shoulder with his fellow to repel
the attacks of non-civilians. And the word
"attack" has many meanings. Practically,
everything is an attack. If an outsider atks
a question, the query is an attack. If an out-
sider complains, the grievance is an attack.
If an outsider begs a favour, the petition is
an attack. If you bear this well in mind,
you cannot go wrong. Adopt it as your
creed, and you may be sure that you will
became immediately an ideal head of a
Government Department.
Say that you have accepted your appoint-
ment, and are prepared to take up at once the
duties appertaining to your new position.
No doubt during vtur attacks" upon the
Milestones you will have come across several
of the officials of the Public Squander Depart-
ment. So when you arrive in the hall of your
new bureau you \\ill be recognised at once
by most of the messengers. You will be con-
ducted with deference to your new quarters.
You will find them very comfortable. Any
number of easy-chairs. Large writing-desk.
Several handsome tables. Rich carpet, rugt
to match, and a coal-scuttle with the depart-
mental cypher. On 1he walls, maps and
some armour. The latter, no doubt, has
come from the Tower, or Holyrood, or Dublin
Castle. Most probably one of your pre-
decessors has given an official dinner in your
room, and the armour is the result of the
importunity nf his Private Secretary.
I tay, TkXTERFORE," Tour predecessor
has observed, "don't you think these walU
are a bit bare? Don't you think you could
get them done up a bit?"
"Certainly, Sir," TENTEBFOBE has replied,
and the result of his energy has been the
trophies you see around you. TENTERFORE
has applied to the people at the Tower, or
Hohrood, or Dublin Castle, and got up quite
a collection of quaint old arra.». They have
been duly received by the Public Squander
Department, and retained. It is a rule of
the bureau that anything that has been once
accepted shall be kept for ever. That is to
say, if it can be clearly proved that the things
retained can be useful somewhere else. You
look round with satisfaction, and then greet
with effusion the chief clerk. He has been
waiting to receive you. As you do not know
the ropes, it is advisable to be civil to every
one. Later on, when you have a talented
assistant to prompt you, you can allow your
cordiality to cool. However, at this moment
it is better to be extremely polite to all the
world, and (if yon know her) his wife. The
chief clerk is delighted to exchange expres-

will. He will put in something neat about
the Milestones as a concession to your labours
in that direction.
"My dear Sir." you will reply with a
smile, "don't bother yourself about them.^ I
can keep them quite safe. We have nothing
to fear from them."
The face of the chief clerk will beam. He
will see that you are one of them. Milestones
for the future are to be defended, not attacked.
He will accept you as an illustrious bureau-
cratic recruit. He will sec that you are ready
to stand shoulder to shoulder in defence of the
office. Could anything be better P
Then for about the thirtieth time you will
be asked if you have selected a private secre-
tary, and the chief clerk will suggest his own
particular nominee. With much cordiality
matter open. You must remember that upon
the appointment your future success depends.
Moreover, it is a nice little piece of patronage
which you may as well retain for yourself.
When yon have selected your private sec-
retary it will be time to get into harness, and
of this operation I hope to treat on some
future occasion.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Gleams of Memory; tcith Some Reflec-
tions, is the happy title of Mr. JAMES PAYN'S
last book, published by SMITH AND ELDER.
The wit of the title Hashes through every
page of the single volume. Within its
modest limits of space will be found not
only some of the best stories of the day, but
stories the best told. Not a superfluous
word spoils the gems, which have been ruth-
lessly taken out of their setting and spread
widecast through the circulation of many
newspapers reviewing the work. Mv Baro-
nite. fortunately, has not space at his dis-
posal to join in this act of flat, though
seductive, burglary. He advi'cs everyone
to go to the book itself. The reader will
find himself enjoying the rare privilege of
intimacy with a cultured mind, and a heart
so kindly that temp'ation to say smart
things at Ihe expense of others, which
underlies the possession of overflowing
humour, is resisted, apparently without
effort. Like the German Emperor or Mr. JUSTI.V McC'ARTiiy, Mr.
PAYN probably "could be very nasty if he liked." He doesn't like,
and is therefore himself liked all the better.
That little tale entitled The Black Patch, by QERTKCIIE CLAY
KEK-SEY M EK, introduces to the public a rather novel character in the
person of a Ml»» Clara Beauchamp an amateur female detective, to
whom SIIEIU.OCK HOLMES, when he chooses to "come out of his
ambush," (for no one believes he fell over that precipice and was killed
about a yc-ar ago,) ought at once to propose. It would be an excellent
firm. CLA UA would make our HOLMES happy, and a certain advertising
medicine provider bearing the same name as the heroine of this sport-
ing story would have another bi$ chance of increasing his "hoard-
ings." The Baron, skilled as he is in plots, owns to having been now
and again puzzled over this one which clever CLARA the Clearer soon
makes apparent to everybody. The story is a working out of the
description of twins, how "each is so like both that you can't tell
t'other from which." But mind you, not ordinary biped twins—oh
dear no—they are .... No .... the Baron respects a lady's secret,
and recommends the inquisitive to get the booK and penetrate the
mystery.
To all those who like a mystery, and who gratefully remember
FLOHENCE WARDEN'S House on the Marsh, let the Baron recommend
A Perfect Fool, by the same authoress. Dickensian students will be
struck by the fact of a " Mr. Dick" being kept on the premises. He is a
eaged Dickie, poor chap; but, like his ancestor the originil Mr. Dick,
he sets every body right at last. The Baron dare not say more, lest
he should let the Dickie out of the cage. The only disappointment,
to old-fashioned novel-readers, at least, who love justice to be done,
and the villain to receive worse than he has given, is in the moral of
the tale; yet in these decadent Yellow Asterical and Green Car-
national days it is as good as can be wished. FLORENCE WARDEN
is neither priggish nor Church-Wardenish; and so, when the scoun-
drel But here, again, the Baron must put his finger to his lips,
and ask you to read the story; when, ana not till then, he may
imagine whether you do not agree with him, "Mystere!"
Cariosity has ever been a weakness of human nature, and that
seems to be the only reason why so many make themselves uncom-
fortable by taking journeys to the Pole. Imitating NANSEN,
GORDON STABLES, M.D., R.N., sends his her.) To Green/and and the
Pule, which he reaches after much " skiliibning" (the book must be
read to grasp its meaning), and receiving a chilly but polite welcome,
with the arrogance of an Englishman breaks the cold silence by
singing the " National Anthem," when of course the Pole is thawed
at once!
Writes a Baronitess Junior, "Those little bovs and girls who de-
light in fairy lore will find a charming story of magical adventures
in Maurice ; or, the Red Jar, by the Countess of JERSEY", or more
appropriately Countess of JERSEY. It is fantastically illustrated by

the poet finely said, ' A thing of beauty is a Jar for ever!'"
The Baron is anxiously expecting the appearance from
Leadenhall Press of Mr. TPER'S Chap-book. Of course, all "the
Chappies " from "Chap 1" to " Last Chap" are on the look out for
it. The Baron fancies it will be a perfect fac-simile, and if not per-
fect, the merciful critic who is merciful to his author will say with
the poet POPE

LETTERS TO A DEBUTANTE.
DEAREST GLADYS,—You have made immense progress since you
first came out. Still, you will he all the better for an occasional hint
from your more sophisticated friend. Your hrief engagement to the
serious young stamp-collector was—whatever may be said against it
—at least, an experience, and I don't at all disapprove of CISSY, and
BABY BEAUMONT, and the other clever boys, but—why call Captain
MASIIINGTON "JACK"? That wonderful tennis-
player, Mrs. LOENF, HOPPER has merely, tacitly,
lent him to yon, she will soon be in London
again, and then, shooting and theatricals over,
"JACK" will also go back to the city of mist
and fog. You will be obliged to return him,
whether "with thanks" or not. He is defi-
nitely charming, but charmingly indefinite,
and, in fact, he is playing with you as you and
OBIEL played with each other, as Miss TOOGOOD
is now playing with OHIEL, and as someone (let
us hope) will, some day, play with Miss TOO-
GOOD. Of course, as long as you both know it's
a game and " play the rules it's all right.
1 enjoyed your letter telling me how " splen-
didly" the theatricals went off, and that
"everyone said it was a great success." My
dear child, you are delightful—quite refresh-
ing; and have kept, in all its early bloom,
your astonishing talent for believing that people
mean, literally, what they say. How on earth
can yon, or any of the other performers, know
whether it was a success or not? Of course
everyone said it was. Quite so; who would be
rude enough to say it was a failure? The
performance, the more praise it would get.
Hatter amateurs to their faces; and, on the other hand, however
admirable it may have been, they nerer fail to abuse it to everyone
else. I don't know whether it's jealousy, or simply irritation at
being obliged to sit still (generally in the dark), and look on while
others are showing off and enjoying themselves; but I do know that
they criticise severely, without exception, all amateur entertain-
ments. As I am your most intimate friend, of course people think it
safe to disparage you to me, and I have had various accounts. All
the men agreed that it was " awful rot," and the women that it was
quite absurd, very dull, and as long as the Cromwell Road; that
our dear CISSY was quite too ridiculously conceited as a manager,
attempting effects, suitable only for Drury Lane, on a tiny drawing-
room stage; for instance, those dreadful stone steps, on which you
were to trip down," and over which you tripped up. You see, my
informant caught you tripping!
CISSY, poor incompetent darling, made, it seems, touching
attempts to be "topical," and "up to date," by allusions of the
tritest and lamest description to the Empire, the CZAB, and dyna-
mite, and by wearing a huge green carnation. The whole thing com-
pletely missed tire, I am told; and was the usual tedious exhibition
of complacent young vanity. You 're too sensible to be offended,
dear, especially as I can no more form a judgment from their
description than from yours—knowing you all to be prejudiced.
However, I quite believe you looked sweet in your pretty costume,
and I wish I had been there to see the fun.
Last night, at dinner, I met your old admirer, Mr. GOLDBEITEB.
He told me he wanted to be married, and asked me "to look out
for a nice wife for him." I am afraid the sort of man who says that
lives to be an old bachelor. I could have looked after him better,
but that on my other side was a person in whom I take great
interest; that is to say, someone I have only just met. The LYON
TAYMEBS would like him. He is a writer, perfectly "new"; and
at present the cause of great disputes as to who discovered him. He
is beautiful, of course young, and will be very agreeable when he has
settled on his pose; at present, he's a little undecided about it.
Not having read a line of his, or even knowing he was an author,
I began with my usual formula, "I am so interested in your work,
Mr. DE TUOCVAILLE" (he's French by descent). He was a little
doubtful of me at first, but I think we shall become friends. He said
nothing about having met me in a previous existence, did not ask if
1 believed in instantaneous sympathy, and omitted to inquire which
was not my day at home. So, you see, he is not quite like everyone
else. Before the end of dinner, he had spoken, very respectfully, but
not unfavourably, of my eyes, and he is going to send me his book,
Enchantment. He belongs to the new literary school they call
"Sensitivists." I wonder what it means! Good-bye, dear.
Ever your loving MAluOKIE.

DEAREST GLADYS,—You have made immense progress since yon
first came out. Still, you will be all the better for an occasional hint
from your more sophisticated friend. Your brief engagement to the
serious young stamp-collector was—whatever may be said against it
—at least, an experience, and I don't at all disapprove of CISSY, and
BABY BEAUMONT, and the other clever boys, but—why call Captain
MASHIITGTON"JACK"? That wonderful tennis- ^
player, Mrs. LOHNE Hop PER has merely, tacitly,
lent him to you, she will soon be in London
again, and then, shooting and theatricals over,
"JACK" will also go back to the city of mist
and fog. i'pu will be obliged to return him,
whether "with thanks" or not. He is defi-
nitely charming, but charmingly indefinite,
and, in fact, he is playing with you as you and
OBIEL played with each other, as Miss TOOGOOD
is now playing with OHIEL, and as someone (let
us hope) will, some day, play with Miss TOO-
GOOD. Of course, as long as you both know it's
a game and " play the rules it's all right.
I enjoyed your letter telling me how " splen-
didly" the theatricals went off, and that
"everyone said it was a great success." My
dear cnild, you are delightful—quite refresh-
ing; and have kept, in all its early bloom,
your astonishing talent for believing that people
mean, literally, what they say. How on earth
can you, or any of the other performers, know
whether it was a success or not? Of course
everyone said it was. Quite so; who would be
rude enough to say it was a failure? The
performance, the more praise it would get.
natter amateurs to their faces; and, on the other hand, however
admirable it may have been, they nerer fail to abuse it to everyone
else. I don't know whether it's jealousy, or simply irritation at
being obliged to sit still (generally in the dark), and look on while
others are showing off and enjoying themselves; but I do know that
they criticise severely, without exception, all amateur entertain-
ments. As I am your most intimate friend, of course people think it
safe to disparage you to me, and I have had various accounts. All
the men agreed that it was " awful rot," and the women that it was
quite absurd, very dull, and as lonpr as the Cromwell Road; that
our dear CISSY was quite too ridiculously conceited as a manager,
attempting effects, suitable only for Drury Lane, on a tiny drawing-
room stage; for instance, those dreadful stone steps, on which you
were to trip down," and over which you tripped up. You see, my
informant caught you tripping!
CISSY, poor incompetent darling, made, it seems, touching
attempts to be "topical," and "up to date," by allusions of the
tritest and lamest description to the Empire, the CZAB, and dyna-
mite, and by wearing a huge green carnation. The whole thing com-
pletely missed fire, I am told; and was the usual tedious exhibition
of complacent young vanity. You 're too sensible to be offended,
dear, especially as I can no more form a judgment from their
description than from yours—knowing you all to be prejudiced.
However, I quite believe you looked sweet in your pretty costume,
and I wish I had been there to see the fun.
Last night, at dinner, I met your old admirer, Mr. GOLDHEITER.
He told me he wanted to be married, and asked me "to look out
for a nice wife for him." I am afraid the sort of man who says that
lives to be an old bachelor. I could have looked after him better,
but that on my other side was a person in whom I take great
interest; that is to eay, someone I have only just met. The LYON
TAYMEKS would like him. He is a writer, perfectly " new"; and
at present the cause of great disputes as to who discovered him. He
is beantif ul, of course young, and will be very agreeable when he has
settled on his pose; at present, he's a little undecided about it.
Not having read a line of his, or even knowing he was an author,
I began with my usual formula, "I am so interested in your work,
Mr. UK TROUVAILLE" (he's French by descent). He was a little
doubtful of me at first, but I think we shall become friends. He said
nothing about having met me in a previous existence, did not ask if
1 believed in instantaneous sympathy, and omitted to inquire which
was not my day at home. So, you see, he is not quite like everyone
else. Before the end of dinner, he had spoken, very respectfully, but
not unfavourably, of my eyes, and he is going to send me his book,
Enchantment. He belongs to the new literary school they call
"Sensitivists." I wonder what it means! Good-bye, dear.
Ever your loving MAIUORIE.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Gleams of Memory; with Some Reflec-
tions, is the happy title of Mr. JAMES PAYN'S
last Wok, published by SMITH AXD ELDER.
The wit of the title flashes through every
page of the single volume. Within its
modest limits of space will be found not
only some of the best stories of the day, but
stories the best told. Not a superfluous
word spoils the gems, which have been ruth-
lessly taken out of their setting and spread
widecast through the circulation of many
newspapers reviewing the work. My Baro-
nite. fortunately, has not space at his dis-
posal to join in this act of flat, though
seduttive, burglary. He advi'cs everyone
to go to the book itself. The reader will
find himself enjoying the rare privilege of
intimacy with u cultured mind, and a heart
so kindly that temp'ation to say smart
things at the expense of others, which
underlies the pissession of overflowing
humour, is resisted, apparently without
effort. Like the German Emperor or Mr. JrsTix MCCARTHY, Mr.
PAVN probably "could be very nasty if he liked.'1 He doesn't like,
and is therefore himself liked all the better.
That little tale entitled The Stack Patch, by GERTRUDE CLAY
KER-SEYMKR, introduces to the public a rather novel character in the
person of a Mim Clara Beaurhamp an amateur female detective, to
whom SHERLOCK HOLMES, when he chooses to "come out of hi"
ambush," (for no one believes he fell over that precipice and was killed
about a year ago,) ought at once to propose. It would be an excellent
firm. CLAKA would make our HOLMES happy, and a certain advertising
medicine provider bearing the same name as the heroine of this sport-
ing story would have another biff chance of increasing his "hoard-
ings." The Baron, skilled as he is in plots, owns to having been now
and again puzzled over this one which clever CLARA the Clearer soon
makes apparent to everybody. The story is a working out of the
description of twins, how "each is so like both that you can't tel
t'other from which." But mind you, not ordinary biped twins—oh
dear no—they are .... No .... the Baron respects a lady's secret,
and recommends the inquisitive to get the book and penetrate the
mystery.
To all those who like a mystery, and who gratefully remember
FLORENCE WARDEN'S House on the Marsh, let the Baron recommend
A Perfect Fool, by the same authoress. Dickensian students will be
struck by the fact of a " Mr. Dick" being kept on the premises. He is a
caged Dickie, poor chap; but, like his ancestor the original Mr. Dick,
he sets everybody right at last. The Baron dare not say more, Ies1
he should let the Dickie out of the cage. The only disappointment,
to old-fashioned novel-readers, at least, who love justice to be done,
and the villain to receive worse than he has given, is in the moral o]
the tale; yet in these decadent Yellow Asterical and Green Car-
national days it is as good as can be wished. FLORENCE WARDEN

Pole, which he reaches after much " skiLibning" (the book must be
read to grasp its meaning), and receiving a chilly but polite welcome
with the arrogance of an Englishman breaks the cold silence bj
singing the " National Anthem" when of course the Pole is thawec
at once!
Writes a Baronitess Junior, "Those little bovs and girls who de-
light in fairy lore will find a charming story of magical adventure
in Maurice ; or, the Ited Jar, by the Countess of JERSEY, or more
appropriately Countess of JERSEY. It is fantastically illustrated by
ROSIE M. M. PITMAN, and published by MACMILLAN & Co., am
shows how unpleasant a jar can be in a family. And yet. has no
the poet finely said, 'A thing of beauty is a Jar for ever!'"
The Baron is anxiously expecting the appearance from Th
Leadenhall Press of Mr. TCEH'S Chap-book. Of course, all "thi
Chappies " from "Chap 1" to " Last Chap" are on the look out fo
it. The Baron fancies it will be a perfect fac-simile, and if not per

LETTERS TO A DEBUTANTE.
DEABEST GLADYS. — You have made immense progress since you
first came out. Still, you will be all the better for an occasional hint
from your more sophisticated friend. Your brief engagement to the
serious young stamp-collector was — whatever may be said against it
—at least, an experience, and I don't at all disapprove of CISSY, and
BABY BEAUMONT, and the other clever boys, but — why call Captain
MASHINGTON "JACK"? Thatwonderful tennis-
player, Mrs. LORNE HOPPER has merely, tacitly,
lent him to you, she will soon be in London
again, and then, shooting and theatricals over,
"JACK" will also go back to the city of mist
and fog. You will be obliged to return him,
whether "with thanks" or not. He is defi-
nitely charming, but charmingly indefinite,
and, in fact, he is playing with you as you and
ORIEL played with each other, as Miss Toocoon
is now playing with ORIEL, and as someone (let
us hope) will, some day, play with Miss TOO-
GOOD. Of course, as long as you both know it 's
a game and " play the rules it 's all right.
I enjoyed your letter telling me how " splen-
didly" the theatricals went off, and that
"everyone said it was a great success." My
dear child, you are delightful— quite refresh-
ing; and have kept, in all its early bloom,
your astonishing talent for believing that people
mean, literally, what they say. How on earth
can you, or any of the other performers, know
whether it was a success or not? Of course
everyone said it was. Quite so; who would be
rude enough to say it was a failure? The
performance, the more praise it would get.
flatter amateurs to their faces; and, on the other hand, however
admirable it may have been, they nerer fail to abuse it to everyone
else. I don't know whether it's jealousy, or simply irritation at
being obliged to sit still (generally in the dark), and look on while
others are showing off and enjoying themselves; but I do know that
they criticise severely, without exception, all amateur entertain-
ments. As I am your most intimate friend, of course people think it
safe to disparage you to me, and I have had various accounts. All
the men agreed that it was " awful rot," and the women that it was
quite absurd, very dull, and as long as the Cromwell Road; that
our dear CISSY was quite too ridiculously conceited as a manager,
attempting effects, suitable only for Drury Lane, on a tiny drawing-
room stage; for instance, those dreadful stone steps, on which you
were to' trip down," and over which you tripped up. You see, my
informant caught you tripping!
CISSY, poor incompetent darling, made, it seems, touching
attempts to be "topical," and "up to date," by allusions of the
tritest and lamest description to the Empire, the CZAR, and dyna-
mite, and by wearing a huge green carnation. The whole thing com-
pletely missed tire, I am told; and was the usual tedious exhibition
of complacent young vanity. You 're too sensible to be offended,
dear, especially as I can no more form a judgment from their
description than from yours — knowing you all to be prejudiced.
However, I quite believe you looked sweet in your pretty costume,
and I wish I had been there to see the fun.
Last night, at dinner, I met your old admirer, Mr. GOLDBEITER.
He told me he wanted to be married, and asked me "to look out
for a nice wife for him." I am afraid the sort of man who says that
lives to be an old bachelor. I could have looked after him better,
but that on my other side was a person in whom I take great
interest; that is to say, someone I have only just met. The LYOJT
TAYMEES would like him. lie is a writer, perfectly "new"; and
at present the cause of great disputes as to who discovered him. He
is beautiful, of course young, and will be very agreeable when he has
settled on his pose; at present, he 's a little undecided about it.
Not having read a line of his, or even knowing he was an author,
I began with my usual formula, "I am so interested in your work,
Mr. DE TROUVAILLE" (he's French by descent). He was a little
doubtful of me at first, but I think we shall become friends. He said
nothing about having met me in a previous existence, did not ask if
I believed in instantaneous sympathy, and omitted to inquire which
was not my day at home. So, you see, he is not quite like everyone
else. Before the end of dinner, he had spoken, very respectfully, but
not unfavourably, of my eyes, and he is going to send me his book.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Gleams of Memory; iriih Some Reflec-
tions, is the happy title of Mr. JAMES PAYN'S
last book, published by SMITH AND ELTIER.
The wit of the title flashes through every
page of the single volume. Within its
modest limits of space will be found not
only some of the best stories of the day, but
stories the best told. Not a superfluous
word spoils the gems, which have been ruth-
lessly taken out of their setting and spread
widecast through the circulation of muuy
newspapers reviewing the work. Mv Baro-
nite. fortunately, has not space at his dis-
posal to join in this act of flat, though
seductive, burglary. He advi-es everyone
to go to the bx<k itself. The reader will
find himself enjoying the rare privilege of
intimacy with a cultured mind, and a heart
so kindly that temp'ation to say smart
tilings at the expense of other?, which
underlies the pissession of overflowing
humour, is resisted, apparently without
effort. Like the German Emperor or Mr. JVSTIX MCCARTHY, Mr.
PA YN probably "could be very nasty if he liked.'1 He doesn't like,
and is therefore himself liked all the better.
That little tale entitled The Black Patch, by GERTRUDE CLAY
KEK-SEYM KR. introduces to the public a rather novel character in the
person of a Miss Clara Beam-hump an amateur female detective, to
whom SHERLOCK HOLMES, when he chooses to "come out of his
ambush," (for no one believes he fell over that precipice and was killf d
about a ytar ago,) ought at once to propose. It would be an excellent
firm. CLA KA would make our HOLMES happy, and a certain advertising
niedicine provider bearing the same name as the heroine of this sport-
ing story would have another big chance of increasing his "hoard-
ings." The Baron, skilled as he is in plots, owns to having been now
and again puzzled over this one which clever CLARA the Clearer soon
makes apparent to everybody. The story is a working out of the
description of twins, how " each is so like both that you can't tel
t'other from which." But mind you, not ordinary biped twins—oh
dear no—they are .... No .... the Baron respects a lady's secret
and recommends the inquisitive to get the booK and penetrate the
mystery.
To all those who like a mystery, and who gratefully remembei
FLORENCE WARDEN'S House on the Marsh, let the Baron recommend
A Perfect Fool, by the same authoress. Dickensian students will be
struck by the fact of a " Mr. Dick" being kept on the premises. He is a
caged Dickie, poor chap; but, like his ancestor the onginil Mr. Dick,
he sets everybody right at last. The Baron dare not say more, lesi
he should let the Dickie out of the cage. The only disappointment,
to old-fashioned novel-readers, at least, who love justice to be done,
and the villain to receive worse than he has given, is in the moral o:
the tale; yet in these decadent Yellow Asterical and Green Car-
national days it is as good as can be wished. FLORENCE WARDEN
is neither priggish nor Church-Wardenish; and so, when the scoun-
drel But here, again, the Baron must put his finger to his lips
and ask you to read the story; when, and not till then, he may
imagine whether you do not agree with him, "Mystere.'"
Curiosity has ever been a weakness of human nature, and tha
seems to be the only reason why so many make themselves uncom-
fortable by taking journeys to the Pole. Imitating NANSEN
GORDON .STABLES, M.D., R.N., sends his hen To Green/and and the
Pule, which he reaches after much " skiliibning" (the book must b(
read to grasp its meaning), and receiving a chilly but polite welcome
with the arrogance of an Englishman breaks the cold silence bi
singing the " National Anthem," when of course the Pole is thawec
at once!
Writes a Baronitess Junior, "Those little bovs and girls who de-
light in fairy lore will find a charming story of magical adventure
in Maurice : or, the Jieil Jar, by the Countess of JERSEY, or more
appropriately Countess of JERSEY. It is fantastically illustrated by
ROSIE M. M. PITMAN, and published by MACMILLAN & Co., am
shows how unpleasant a jar can be in a family. And yet has no
the poet finely said, 'A thing of beauty is a Jar for ever!'"
The Baron is anxiously expecting the appearance from Th
Leadenhall Press of Mr. TDER'S Chap-book. Of course, all "th
Chappies " from "Chap 1 " to " Last Chap" are on the look out fo
it. The Baron fancies it will be a perfect fac-simile, and if not per

the populace to such a degree, that CICEBO

PRIMULA, as I have already said in response
to an appeal from a friend of the modern
OBBTLIUS (not like HOBACE'S pedagogue,
"Plagosus" though), "After a contentions
life of fifty-two years, I am naturally
anxious to spend the remainder of my days
in freedom from controversy."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
A DEPUTY-ASSISTANT of the Baron has been perusing with great
The: Catch of the County, by Mrs. EDWARD KEXXARD,
a lady who is already responsible for
The Hunting Girl; Wedded to Sport,
and a number of other romances dear to
the heart of those who follow the hounds.
The deputy-assistant reports that he
was delighted with the newest of the
authoress's novels, and found the three
volumes rather too short than too long.
Now that London is in the midst of
November and its fogs, those who dwell
near the frosted-silvery Thames can
take a real pleasure in stories of the
country. To sum up, The Catch of
the Countu must (to adopt the slang of the moment) have "caught
on." A fact that must be as satisfactory to Mrs. KEXNARD as to
her readers. And when both supply and demand are pleased, Messrs.
F. V. WHITE & Co., the publishers, must also (like Cox and Sox) be
"satisfied."
A Baronitess writes: "Gaily-bound Christmas books [have been
facing me for some time, and, with an iiisinuating look, seem to say,
'Turn over a new leaf.' We do: many new leaves."
BLACKIE AND SON could be called first favourites in the boys' field
of literature. They make a good start with Jl'iilf the Stixon and
In the Heart of the Rockies, both by G. A. HENTY. They are both
capital specimens of the Hentyprising hero.
In Press-Gang Dat/s. By EDWARD PICKERING. A story, not a
newspaper romance, though it is a new edition of the type of the
wicked uncle, who makes use of '' the liberty of the Press" to have his
nephew bound—as if he were a book worth preserving—and taken off
to sea. This proceeding made an impression on our good brave youth,
who, after fighting with NELSON, learnt that " an Englishman should
do his duty, escapes a French prison, and returns to "give.what
for" to his uncle.
Most interesting and practical is The Whist Table, edited bv PORT-
LAND, especially to those whose only idea of the game is alter the
style of the man in Happy Thoughts who knows that the scoring had
something to do with a candlestick and half-a-crown. In this book
they will find a helping hand which gives the " e'rect" card to play.
Both these books, published by JOHN HOGG, are pig-culiarly good.
"A powerful finish," quoth the Baron, leaning upon the chair-
arm, and, like the soldier in the old ballad, wiping away a tear which
he had most unwillingly shed over the last chapter of Children of
Circumstance, " a very powerful finish. There is some comedy, too,
in the story (which, I regret to say, is spun out into three volumes)—
rather Meredithian perhaps, but still forming some relief to the sick-
nesses, illnesses and deaths—there are certainly three victims of
IOTA'S steel and one doubtful—of which the narrative has more than
its fair share." Of the comedy portion, the courtship of Jim and Jtica
is excellent. But where other novels err in superfluity of description
and lack of dialogue, the fault of this one is just the other way, and
the dialogues may be, not "skipped," but bounded over. Nothing
of the earlier portion, nor the powerful final chapter of this story can
be missed: as for the intermediate stage, when the intelligent and
experienced novel-reader has once grasped the characters, he can
drop in on them now and then, in a friendly way, and see how they
are getting on.
The Baron congratulates Messrs. MACMILLAN on a charming little
book called Cori'ilmi's Songs, which are not all songs sung by that
youthful Angler-Saxon whose parent was IZAAK WALTON, but also
Bongs by GAT, FIELDING, and Anonymi. To these worthy Master
AUSTIN DOBSON hath written a mighty learned and withal enter-
taining preface, the gems of the book being the illustrations, done by
HUGH THOMSON in his best stvle, "wherewith," quotes the in-
corrigible Baron, "I am Hughgely pleased." 'Tis an excellent
Christmas present, as, "if I may be permitted to say so," quoth the
Baron, sotto race, "to those whom Providence hath blest with
friends and relatives expecting gifts in the coming 'festive season,'
is also a certain single volume entitled Under the Rose, an illus-
trated work, not altogether unknown, as a serial, in Mr. Punch's
pages, and highly recommended by
THE .JUDICIOUS BARON DE BOOK-WORMS."

Hanover Square"! His name was mentioned one day last week in
the Times' " Ecclesiastical Intelligence." It is the Rev. J. STOBRS.

siastical STORBS."

GISMOJNDA.
(To Mr. Punch.)
DEAR MISTER,—To yon, who are a so great lover of the theatre,
english and french, I send my impressions'of the first of the new drama
of Mister SAHDOU. It is to you of to spread them in the country of the
immortal SHJKSPIR. Allow that I render my homages to this name
so illustrious, me who have essayed since so long time to speak and to
write the language of that great author. And see there, in fine I can
to do it!
It wants me some words for to praise the put in scene'of this new
drama at the theatre of Mistress SARAH BKBXHARDT. (lismonda.'
It is magnificent! It is superb! It is a dream! Ah! if your
SHIKSPIR could see this luxury of decorations, this all together so
glorious! Him who had but a curtain and an etiquette! And
MoLiERE? And RACINE P Could they make to fabricate of such
edifices, of such trees, of such furniture? They had not these—how
say you in english—"proprieties," which belong to the proprietor?
Yes, I think that I have heard the phrase, "offend against the pro-
prieties." We never offend against them in the theatres of Paris;
they are always as it should be. But here, at the Renaissance, Mis-
tress BERNHAHDT has done still more. Each scenery is a picture of
the most admirables, a veritable blow of the eye.
I go to give you of them a short description. The first picture is
the Acropolis, under the domination of the Florentines at the end of
the fourteenth century. What perfume of
poetry antique! What costumes! That has
the air of an account of BOCCACCIO, of a picture
of BOTTICELLI. One sees there the figures of
ANGELICO, the colours of VERONESE. It is an
ALMA-TEDDAM A of the middle age. And when
Mistress BERXIIARDT and her following, all
resplendent of costume, are assembled upon
the scene, one can see realised a group from
the Decameron. And the second picture, and
the third, and the fourth? Can I say more of
them? They are superb. In the fourth there
is a cypress high of six yards, there, alone, at
the middle of the scene. One says he is
natural. That may be. In any case he is
marvellous. But the fifth picture, it is sub-
lime! One cannot more! It is the last word of the modern theatre!
It wants me the words, it wants me the place for to speak of it.
SniKSPiR alone would have could to render justice to this picture so
ravishing.
As to the action of the piece, you will desire to know something.
Frankly I tell you I observed it not. In the middle of this luxury
of decorations there wander here and there some persons, dressed at
the mode the most beautiful, who speak in effect not too shortly.
There are veritable discourses—how say you "conferences" ?—on
florentine history, of the most interesting*, but a little long. The
brave Frenchmans pronounce the Italian names in good patriots.
They imitate not the accent of our perfidious neighbours of the
Triple Alliance. Ah no! They say them as in french. And what
names! Acciajaoli.' It is like a sneeze. And Mistress BEHNHAEDT
is gentle, caressing, passionate, contemptuous, and terrible turn to
turn; she murmurs softly, and at the fine she screams. And
Mister GUITRY is severe and menacing: he speaks at low voice, and
at the fine he shouts. But after all what is that that is that that r1
One thinks not to it. The decorations, the costumes! Sec there
that which one regards, that which one applauds, that which one
shall forget never!
Be willing to agree the assurance of my high consideration.
STRAPONTIN.
MAYEN-AISY-NOW!
MISTHER PUNCH, SORRS—Frinchmen are that eonsaited they think
no one can invint anything but thimselves. It's as well known as
the storv of Mulligan's leather breeches that the first Earl of MAYO

it's just as harmless as new milk from the cow; and shure it's

resplendent of costume, are assembled upon f/
the scene, one can see realised a group from
the Decameron. And the second picture, and
the third, and the fourth? Can I say more of
them? They are superb. In the fourth there
is a cypress high of six yards, there, alone, at
the middle of the scene. One says he is
natural. That may be. In any case he is
marvellous. But the fifth picture, it is sub-
lime! One cannot more I It is the last word of the modern theatre!
It wants me the words, it wants me the place for to speak of it.
SIIIKSPIR alone would have could to render justice to this picture so
ravishing.
As to the action of the piece, you will desire to know something.
Frankly I tell you I observed it not. In the middle of this luxury
of decorations there wander here and there some persons, dressed at
the mode the most beautiful, who speak in effect not too shortly.
There are veritable discourses—how say you "conferences " f—on
florentine history, of the most interestings, but a little long. The
brave Frenchmans pronounce the Italian names in good patriots.
They imitate not the accent of our perfidious neighbours of the
Triple Alliance. Ah no! They say them as in french. And what
names! Acciajaoli.' It is like a sneeze. And Mistress BERNHARDT
is gentle, caressing, passionate, contemptuous, and terrible turn to
turn; she murmurs softly, and at the fine she screams. And
Mister GUITBY is severe and menacing; he speaks at low voice, and
at the fine he shouts. But after all what is that that is that that?
One thinks not to it. The decorations, the costumes! See there
that which one regards, that which one applauds, that which one
shall forget never!
Be willing to agree the assurance of my high consideration.

•2. Describe your duties to your chief (1)
when he is in town but wants to be thought
away in the country, and (2) when you have
to assist him as "Vice-chair" at a dinner
party.
3. Given that you have for neighbours at a
political banquet a race-horse owner, a sup-
porter of the temperance cause, a theatrical
proprietor, and a rural dean. Write an
anecdote that will interest all of them, and
cause the conversation between them to be
general.
4. Take the following facts. Owing to a
blunder, a ship has been sent to a wrong port,
carrying a wrong cargo to a wrong receiver,
who has sent it away, and thus prevented it
being used for its right purpose. This trilling
error of judgment has caused a war that could

THE CHRONICLES OF A RURAL PARISH.
II.—PRELIMINARY CANTERS.
I SAID, when I last took up my pen as a veracious chronicler of the
recent history of Mudford (for this is the name of our village; not
elegant, perhaps, but none the less true to life), that my meeting
deserved a chapter to itself. It does. It deserves, in point of fact,
many chapters, though I only purpose to
give it one. But it must be the third
chapter, and not the second. For before
this meeting was held, many things hap-
pened, and as I look back I often wonder
how it was that I was enabled to endure all
the trials and tribulations which Fortune
had in store for me, and that I am spared
to write this unprentending account of all
that happened. I say this, because I have
been reading of late historical romances, and
I find from them that a little moralising
is never out of place in the course of a
story.
The first thing I did was to issue a bill,
stating that the meeting would be held. It
was headed, "Mudford," and announced
that I—described as TIMOTHY WIXKINS,
Esq., J.P. (for I boast that proud distinc-
tion through an error of the Lord Chan-
cellor of the period, who mistook me for a
member of his party, which I was not)—that I would explain the
provisions and working of the Parish Councils Act, that "ques-
tions would be invited at the close," and that "all persons were
cordially invited to attend." I sent a copy of this to every one in
the village, and then fondly imagined that I should hear no more
about the matter till the fateful night approached. In that I was
mistaken, however.
Next morning, as I was sitting in my study—curiously enough
getting ready some notes for what was to be my epoch-making
speech—I saw coming up the drive two ladies, whom I recognised as
Mrs. LETHAM HAVITT and Mrs. A HULK MARCH, both ladies, I re-
membered, who had made themselves prominent in politics in the

Federation, and Mrs. MARCH as a Lady Crusader (is that right JO
of the Primrose League. A moment later, and those ladies were
ushered into my room.
"We've come," said Mrs. HAVITT, cutting the cackle, and coming
at once to the 'osses, "we 've come to see you about that meeting."
'' Oh, indeed!" I murmured '' Yes, the meeting."
"We notice," said Mrs. AHBLE MARCH, taking up the running,
"that you only say ' persons' may attend the meeting. Now we 're
very much afraid that women won't understand that they may come."
"But surely," I protested, feebly, "a woman is a person.'
"Well, we think*' (this as a duet) " that you ought to say that ' all
persons, men or women, married or single, are invited to attend.'"
I was a good deal staggered, and thought of asking whether they
wouldn't like the name of the village altered, or my name printed
without the J.P., but I refrained. I promised to print new bills, and
I did it. I thought it would be a poor beginning to a peaceful revo-
lution to have an angry woman in every household.
Those were mv first visitors. After that I had about two calls a
day. One day the Vicar dropped in to afternoon tea, to congratulate
me on my public spirit. I confess I felt rather phased. I had
evidently done the right, the high-minded, the patriotic thing. My
mind became filled with visions of myself as Chairman of the Parish
Council, the head man of a contented village. Just before he left,
however, the Vicar suggested that I should advise the electors to
elect into the chair someone who had had previous training of what
its duties and responsibilities were, and I suddenly remembered that
the Vicar was the present Chairman of the Vestry. Then somehow
I guessed why I had been favoured with a visit. The curious thing
was, that my next caller (who arrived half an hour afterwards)
came to say that the most satisfactory thing in the whole Act was,
that the clergyman could not take the chair. Then my memory onee
more told me what manner of man I was talking to—he was a
prominent local preacher. I was being nobbled.
And so it went on. My answer to all who came was, lhat they
could come and ask me questions at the meeting. Is was a con-
venient plan enough —at the time. Yet my suggestions — like
chickens and cones—came home to roost- at the meeting. And that,
as I have said, is the third chapter.

THE CHRONICLES OF A RURAL PARISH.
II.—PRELIMINARY CANTERS.
I SAID, when I last took up my pen as a veracious chronicler of the
recent history of Mudford (tor this is the name of our village; not
elegant, perhaps, but none the less true to life), that my meeting
deserved a chapter to itself. It does. It deserves, in point of fact,
many chapters, though I only purpose to
give it one. But it must he the third
chapter, and not the second. For hefore
this meeting was held, many things hap-
pened, and as I look back I often wonder
how it was that I was enabled to endure all
the trials and tribulations which Fortune
had in store for me, and that I am spared
to write this unprentending account of all
that happened. I say this, because I have
been reading of late historical romances, and
I find from them that a little moralising
is never out of place in the course of a
story.
The first thing I did was to issue a bill,
stating that the meeting would be held. It
was headed, "Mudford," and announced
that I—described as TIMOTHY WIXKINS,
Esq., J.P. (for I boast that proud distinc-
tion through an error of the Lord Chan-
cellor of the period, who mistook me for a
member of his party, which I was not)—that I would explain the
provisions and working of the Parish Councils Act, that "ques-
tions would be invited at the close," and that "all persons were
cordially invited to attend." I sent a copy of this to every one in
the village, and then fondly imagined that I should bear no more
about the matter till the fateful night approached. In that I was
mistaken, however.
Next morning, aa I was sitting in my study—curiously enough
getting ready some notes for what was to be my epoch-making
speech—I saw coming up the drive two ladies, whom I recognised as
Mrs. LETHAM HAVITT and Mrs. ABBLE MARCH, both ladies, I re-
membered, who had made themselves prominent in politics in the

Federation, and Mrs. MABCH as a Lady Crusader (is that right H
of the Primrose League. A moment later, and those ladies were
ushered into my room.
"We 've come," said Mrs. HAVITT, cutting the cackle, and coming
at once to the 'oases, "we 've come to see you about that meeting."
"Oh, indeed!" I murmured "Yes, the meeting."
"We notice," said Mrs. AEHLE MARCH, taking up the running,
"that you only say ' persons' may attend the meeting. Now we 're
very much afraid that women won't understand that they mav come."
"But surely," I protested, feebly, "a woman is a person.
"Well, we think'' (Mi's as a duet) " that you ought to say that' all
persons, men or women, married or single, are invited to attend.'"
I was a good deal staggered, and thought of asking whether they
wouldn't like the name of the village altered, or my name printed
without the J.P., but I refrained. I promised to print new bills, and
I did it. I thought it would be a poor beginning to a peaceful revo-

(He dwells on this behest)—

CURIOUS.—A lady who had
read the two recent contro-
versies anent the Lords and
the Empire got slightly
muddled. "Well, I 've never
seen anything wrong," she
said, "in Promenade Peers."
FIRST IMPRESSIONS.
FLORENCE! 0 glorious city of LORENZO the Magnificent, cradle of
the Renaissance, birthplace of DANTE, home of BOCCACCIO, where
countless painters ana sculptors produced those deathless works
which still fascinate an admiring world, at last I approach thee! I
arrive at the station, I scramble for a facchino, I drive to my hotel.
It is night. To-morrow all thy medieval loveliness will burst upon
my enraptured eyes.
In the morning up early and out. Immediately fall against a
statue of a fat man in a frock coat and trousers. Can this be
MICHAEL ANQELO'S Dacid? No, no! It is Ifanin by NONO. Turn
hastily aside and discover a quay. Below is a waste of mud, through
which meander a few inches of thick brown water. The Arno!
Heavens, what associations! Raise my eyes and perceive on the
opposite bank a gasometer. Stand horror-stricken in the roadway,
and am nearly run over by a frantic bicyclist. Save myself by a
great effort and cling for support to a gaslamp until I can recover
from the shock. Resolve then to seek out the medieval loveliness.
Start along the quay. Ha, there is a statue! Doubtless by MICHAEL
ANOELO. Hardly; the face seems familiar. Of course, it is GARI-
BALDI! Turn and fly up a narrow street. Here at last is something
old, here at last are the buildings on which I) \s IT. may have looked,
in which FRA ANGELICO may have painted, here at last . Why,
what's this? It's an omnibus. It fills the street. Wedge myself
in a doorway, and when it has passed within three inches of my toes,
hurry down a side street, a still narrower one. Here, perhaps, BEN-
VESCTO CELLINI devised some glorious metal work. Ha, there is a
silversmith's even to this day! Look! what are those things in the
window, above the inscription "English Spoken"? They are tea-
pots from Birmingham! Resolve to avoid small streets, and hurry
on to large opt n piazza. Now for some architecture by GIOTTO, some
sculpture by DONATELLO! Yes, there is an equestrian statue.
Doubtless one of the MEDICI. At last! No, it'snot. It's VICTOR
being a speaking one. gives no information. Turn sadly aside and
contemplate some melancholy modern copies of the regular architec-
ture of rectangular Turin.
Begin to feel depressed. Have not yet found the romantic
medievalism. Somewhat revived by dejeuner, resolve to seek it in
the suburbs. Of course-Fiesole. A pilgrimage to the home of FRA
ANGELICO. Sublime! Will go on foot, avoiding the high road.
Climb by narrow ways, past garden walls. Behind them may be the
gardens where BOCCACCIO'S stories were told; down these narrow
roads FRA ANGELICO may have passed. How exquisite to meditate
far from the tourist crowd! Filled with enthusiasm, and gazing at
the beautiful blue sky, arrive at the top, and stumble headlong over
some obstacle in the road. It is the rail of a tramway! Stagger
feebly to the Piazza ju^t as the electric tramcar bumps and rumbles
up the hill. From it descends a crowd, carrying, not lilies, as in
AJJGELICO'S pictures, but Bsedekers. And I hear no tale from the
Decameron, but a mingled confusion of strange tongues. "Ja,ja,
/a; what a squash; nous f lions un peu terres mais enfin ; ach tcun-
derschiin; un soldo signore; fa, ja, ja; wal, I guess this is
Feay&olay, che rumore net tram; I say, let's buy one of these straw
fans for Aunt MART; they 're awfully cheap, only half a franc, and
look worth half-a-crown; ah roila le cafe; wollen tie ein Glas Bier
trinken ; ja, ja, ja!" Resolve to abandon search for medieval
loveliness, and go down sadly in the tramcar.
But one art remains. In the country where VERDI still writes
I can at least enjoy music. So after dinner seek the Trianon. It
sounds like a music-hall; but then here, even in a music-hall, there
must be music. As I enter, a familiar sound bursts upon my ear.
The singer is Italian, the words are French, but the tune is English.
She is singing " The Man that Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo."
A FIRST IMPRESSIONIST.
"AH!" sighed Mrs. R. sadly, when her advice had not been taken
KM A M KI,. At least, the inscription says so, though the likeness, not
by her daughter, "I 'm a mere siphon in the family!"

PAULA PATBICK CAMPBELL."
UNDER A CLOUD; OB, AN OXFORD (COMPACT) MIXTURE.
HAROLD and HUBKHT were two pretty men,
Puzzled by plot when the clock strikes ten.
Up jump: HAKOLD, "A cloud in the sky!"
"Comrade !" cries UVIIEKT, "how '« thai for high?"
SOFT hair that ripples like a lake
What time the water-lilies wake,
Fair rosy cheeks and eyes of blue,
Clear windows that the soul sees through,
A moving gracet a brow of snow:
Such were the girls we used to know.
But now we tremble as we spy
Woman's advancing majesty:
NEW AND OLD.
(By One who prefers the Old.)
The flashing eyes, the brows that knit,
The ready tongue all themes to fit,
The heavy stride—the hose in hue
Unlike her eyes and deeply blue.
Gone are the locks of golden brown
That hung on gleaming shoulders down:
Close-cropped as never Roundhead knave
In sternest times aspired to shave,
Not MILTON'S self, however blind.
To toy with such had felt inclined.
0 monstrous growth of modern times,
Not thine the lilt of lover's rhymes,
Whom some grim don perchance may wed,
Who scorns the heart and sues the head:
Farewell for ever and a day,
Miss ARAMINTA JOSES, B.A. I

PABT XXI.— THE FEELINGS OK M
SCENE XXXI.— The Morning Room. TIME— Sunday morning;
^ust after breakfail.
Captain Thicknesse (outtide, to TEEDWBLL). Dogcart round, eh?
everything in? All right — shan't be a minute. (Entering.) Hallo,
PfLLlNEH, you all alone here? (He looks round disconcertedly.)
Don't happen to have seen Lady MAISIE about?
Pilliner. Let me see— she was here a little while ago, I fancy. . . .
Why? Do you want her?
Capt. Thick. No— only to say good-bye and that. I 'm just off.
Pill. Off? To-day! You don't mean to tell me your chief is
such an inconsiderate old ruffian as to ezpeot you to travel back to
your TOMMIES on the Sabbath I You could wait till to-morrow if
you wanted to. Come now!
Capt. Thick. Perhaps — only, you see, I don't want to.
Pill. Well, tastes differ. A cross-country
journey in a slow train, with unlimited oppor-
tunities of studying the Company's bye-laws
and traffic arrangements at several admirably
ventilated junctions, is not my own idea of the
best way to spend a cheery Sunday, that 's all.
Capt. Thick, (gloomily). Daresay it will be
about as cheery as stoppin' on here, if it comes
to that.
Pill. I admit we were most of us a wee bit
chippy at breakfast. The Bard conversed — but
he seemed to diffuse a gloom somehow. Shut
you up once or twice in a manner that might
almost be described as d — d offensive.
Cant. Thick. Don't know what you all saw
in what he said that was so amusin'. Con-
founded rude / thought it!
Pill. Don't think anyone was amused — unless
it was Lady MAISIE. By the way, he might
perhaps have selected a happier topic to hold
forth to Sir RUPERT on than the scandalous
indifference of large landowners to the condi-
tion of the rural labourer. Poor dear old boy,
he stood it wonderfully, considering. Pity the
Countess breakfasted upstairs; she'd have en-
joyed herself. However, he had a very good
audience in little Lady MAISIE.
Capt. Thick. I do hate a chap that jaws at
breakfast. . . . Where did you say she was?
I.iuli/ JUaisie's voice (outside, in Conserva-
tory). Yes, you really ought to see the Orangery
and the Elizabethan Garden, Mr. BLAIR. If
vou will be on the terrace in about five minutes.
I could take you round myself. I must go and
see if I can get the keys nrst.
Pill. If you want to say good-bye, old fellow,
now 's your chance!
Capt. Thick. It— it don't matter. She's
engaged. Ami, look here, you needn't mention
that I was askin' for her.
PiU. Of course, old fellow, if you 'd rather
not. (He glances at him.) But I say, mv
dear old chap, if that 's how it is with yon, 1
don't quite see the sense of chucking it up
already, don't you know. No earthly affair of
mine, 1 know; still, if I could manage to stay on, I would, if I
were you.
Capt. Thick. Hang it all, PnxiifER, do you suppose /don't know
when the game 's up I If it was any good stay in' on - And besides,
I 've said good-bye to Lady C., and all that. No, it's too late now.
Tredwell (at the door). Excuse me, Sir, but if you 're going by
the 10.40, you haven't any too much time.
Pill, (to himself, after Captain THICKNESSK has hurried out). Poor
old chap, he does seem hard hit! Pity he's not Lady MAISIE'H
sort. Though what she can see in that long-haired beggar -!
Wonder when VIVIAN SPBLWANE intends to come down; never
knew her miss breakfast before. . . . What 's that rustling ? . . .
Women! I '11 be off, or they '11 nail me for church before I know it.
\ fir disappears hastily in the direction of the Smoking Room
as Lady CANTIRE and Mrs. CHATTERIS enter.
Lady Cantire. Nonsense, my dear, no walk at all; the church is
only just across the park. My brother RUPERT always goes, and it
pleases him to see the Wy vern pew as full as possible. I seldom feel
equal to going myself, because I find the necessity of allowing pulpit
inaccuracy to pass without a protest gets too much on my nerves;
but my daughter will accompany you. You'll have just time to run
Mrs. Chalteris (with arch significance). I don't fancy I shall have
the pleasure of your daughter's society this morning. I just met her
going to get the garden keys; I think she has promised to show the
grounds to Well, I needn't mention whom. Oh [dear me, I
hope I 'm not being indiscreet again!
Lady Cant. I make a point of never interfering with my
daughter's proceedings, and you can easily understand how natural
it is that such old friends as they have always been

her' mother But dear Lady CANTIRE is so advanced about
things.
Lady Cant, (to herself). Darling MAISLE! He'll be Lord DUN-
DERHEAD before very long. How sensible and sweet of her! And
I was quite uneasy about them last night at dinner; they scarcely
seemed to be talking to each other at all. But there's a great deal
more in dear MAISIE than one would imagine.
Sir Rupert (outside). We 're rather proud of
our church, Mr. UNDERSHELL—fine old monu-
ments and brasses, if you care about that sort
of thing. Some of us will be walking over to
service presently, if you would like to
Undershell (outside—to himself). And lose
my tete-a-tete with Lady MAISIE! Not exactly!
(Aloud.) I am afraid, Sir RUPERT, that I can-
not conscientiously
Sir Rup. (hastily). Oh. very well, very well:
do exactly as you like about it, of course. I
only thought—— (To himself.) Now that
other young chap would have gone!
Lady Cant. RUPERT, who is that you are
talking to out there? I don't recognise his
voice, somehow.
Sir Rup. (entering with UNDERSHELL). Ha,
ROHESIA, you 've come down, then? slept well,
I hope. I was talking to a gentleman whose
acquaintance I know you will be very happy to
make—at last. This is the genuine celebrity
this time. (To UNDERSHELL.) Let me make
you known to my sister, Lady CANTIHE, Mr.
UNDERSHELL. (As Lady CANTIRE glares in-
terrogatively.) Mr. CLARION BLAIR, ROHESIA,
author of hum—ha—Andromache.
Lady Cant. I thought we were given to
understand last night that Mr. SPURRELL—Mr.
BLAIR—you must pardon me, but it's really so
very confuting—that the writer of the—aih—
volume in question had already left Wyyern.
Sir Rup. Well, my dear, you see he is still
here—er—fortunately for us. If you '11 excuse
me, I '11 leave Mr. BLAIR to entertain you ; got
to speak to TREDWELL about something.

suppose, but I can't stay here and entertain
her long! (Aloud.) Lady CANTIRE, I—er—

in these days of literary over-production that I have long made it a
rule to read no literature of a lighter order that has not oeen before
the world for at least ten years. I may be mistaken, but I infer
from your appearance that your own work must be of a considerably

necessity to remain.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.
Lady Cant, (offering a cold cheekbone for'salutation). I am in my
usual health, thank you, ALBINIA. As to last night, if you must ask
a literary Socialist down here, you might at least see that he is
received with common courtesy. You may, for anything you can tell,
have advanced the Social Revolution ten years in a single evening!
Lady Culr. My dear RoHESlA I If you remember, it was you
yourself who!
Lady Cant, (closing her eyes). I am in no condition to argue about
it, ALBLNIA. The slightest exercise of your own common sense would
have shown you But there, no great harm has been done, for-
tunately, so let us say no more about it. I have something more
agreeable to talk about. I 've every reason to hope that MAISIE and
dear GEBALD THICKNESSE
Lady Culv. (astonished). MAISIE? But I thought GERALD
TniCKNEssE spoke as if!
Lady Cant. Very possibly, my dear. I have always refrained from
giving him any encouragement, and I wouldn't put any pressure
upon dear MAISIE for the world— still, I have my feelings as a mother,
and I can't deny that, with such prospects as he has now, it is gratify-
ing for me to think that they may be coming to an understanding
together at this very moment; she is showing him the grounds;
which I always think are the great charm of Wy vern, so secluded!
Lady Culv. (puzzled). Together! At this very moment! But—
but surely GEHALD has gone?
Lady Cant. Gone! What nonsense, ALBINIA! Where in the
world should he have gone to?
Lady Culr. He teas leaving by the 10.40,1 know. For Aldershot.
I ordered the cart for him, ana he said good-bye after breakfast.
He seemed so dreadfully down, poor fellow, that I quite fancied from
what he said that MAISIR must have
Lady Cant. Impossible, my dear, quite impossible! I tell you he
is here. Why, only a few minutes ago, Mrs. CnATTEHis was telling
me Ah, here she is to speak for herself. (ToMrs. CHATTEEIS, who
appears, arrayed for public service.) Mrs. CHATTKHIS, did I, or did
I nut, understand you to say just now that my daughter MAISIE?
Mrs. Chatt. (alarmed). But, dear Lady CANTIHE, I had no idea
you would disapprove. Indeed you seemed And really, though
she certainly takes an interest in him, I'm sure—almost sure-
there can be nothing serious—at present.
Lady Cant. Thank you, my dear, I merely wished for an answer
to my question. And you see, ALBINIA, that GEBALD THICKXESSE
can hardly have gone yet, since he is walking about the grounds with
MAISIE.
Mrs. Chatt. Captain THICKNESSE P But he has gone, Lady CAN-
TIKE! I saw him start. I didn't mean him.
Lady Cant. Indeed? then I shall be obliged if you will say who it
is you did mean.
Mrs. Chatt. Why, only her old friend and admirer—that little
poet man, Mr. BLAIR.
Lady Cant, (to hersel/). And I actually tent him to her! (Rising
in majestic wrath.) ALBINIA, whatever comes of this, remember I
shall hold you entirely responsible!
[She sweeps out of the room; the other i\cr> ladies look after
her, and then at one another, in silent consternation.
THE WHIMS OF AMPHITRYON.
ISN'T our good friend of the P. M. 6. a little extravagant with his
culinary raptures? However, we will not be outdone. If he rhap-
sodises the 'Magnificent Mushroom," we have discovered a still more
exalting theme, which, taking "whelk" as pronounced, we will call
THE WITCHERY OF THE WHELK.
Would you learn the divinest glory of a goddess among molluscs?
Would you note the gastronomic charms of a succulent sea-nymph P
Ostracise, then, from your table the blue-point impostor that foists
his bearded banality on the faithful elect. Let the cult of that lusty
Titan, the Limpet, sink awhile into the limbo of outworn idolatries.
Forbear, if you are wise, to hymn the stern masculinity of the Mussel,
gregarious demi-god but taciturn, hermetically sealed within the
wilful valves of a sulky self-effacement. And let that other fakir of
the sea-marge, the fantastic and Pharisaic Scallop, ply his Eleusinian
rites, unrevered by the devout and metaphor-mixing epicure.
Rather let it be ours to celebrate, though baldest prose were all-in-
sufficient, the allurements of a pandemic Aphrodite, the seductive
Whitechapel Whelk, and the coy grace of her sister, the wanton
Winkle of Rosherville.
Let us take the last-assume that the siren is yours, then
consider how fitliest she shall be dressed. And here it shall be seen
whether you have true chivalry and romance in your soul, or
whether you grovel in mere sensual gourmandise. What says
Master BILL NUTKINS, master-conk to the Blue Pig chop-house in i
Skittle-alley? Is there not an idyllic flavour of Cocaigne, a very
fervour of simplicity about his spelling which goes straight to the
gizzard of the whelk-worshipper? Listen to his wise counsel on

"ALL IS NOT GOLD," &c.
Gentleman (in wailing for his Wife, at 'Great Annual Sale," to Head
of Department). "You MUST DO AN KNOBMOUS BUSINESS ON DATS
LIKE THIS."
Head of Department. "NOT so MUCH AS YOU MIGHT FANCY. THK
OBEAT MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE HBRE TO-DAY ABE SHOPPING—
NOT BUYING I"
"Tyke three 'aputh of whilks, 'Erne By sort fer choice, and
chuck 'em wiv a saveloy and a kipper into a sorcepan, if you can
nick one from a juggins. Bile 'em till they 're green, and add "arf a
glorss of unsweetened, tho it's a pity to wyste it. If toimes is 'ard,
the kids and the missus can 'ave the rinsings, or go wivout. Taike
my tip, and don't yon be a bloomin' mug. You can blyme well
stick to the juggins' sorcepan. You may, I dessay, raise arf a
dollar on it." There speaks the true gourmet, with single-hearted
straight-forward egotism, worthy of a City alderman, in all the
glory of a civic banquet. To none but an artist in guttlery would
that touch of genius about the kids and the missus occur.
Again, disdain not the sweetly subtle recipes and romantic fancies
that you may gather during your sojourn at Colney Hatch. For there,
far from the dull Philistinism of house-dinners and fried-fish shops,
with all wild Mtenad orgies mav your divinity be adored. Learn but
one magic formula, and you shall see the wizard-working of your
incantation, as, like an enchantress herself bewitched, she assumes
you an ensorceled, faery shape. Here, mark you, is this potent
spell, culled from the inspired lips of a frenzied rhff.
To Make Whelk Fritters.—Take one ri]>e whelk, draw and truss
it until you are black in the face, tie up the forequarter with chick-
weed, sit down, and smoke a pipe; parboil an?thing you like for a
Few hours, or don't, if you don't care to; rub the nurt'e through a

faisandf, mud-salad, and betes noire: dredge the gallimaufrey, and
hold vour nose; write some letters; the rol-au-rent will then
explode; wrap the pieces in an old sock, and bury for six weeks;
take the 2.13 train to. town, and have your hair cut, or pay some
calls; then start again with another whelk, and proceed as before;
but it is better to buy the fritters ready-made."
Is not this a lesson in devotion and perseverance? Rejoice greatly,
and work out your sybaritic salvation.
And now that you have food for pious reflection, after a space you
shall, to your exceeding great advantage, be further instructed in the
whelks a la Phoreditch :—

MORE SHE-NOTES.
(By IOPNA, Author of "A
Yellow Plaster.")
CHAPTER I.
"ViitarsiBus puerisgue"
said Miss CONSTANTIA DEM-
NING; "and it's by a man.'"
"By a man!" echoed the
awe-struck ATHANASIA.
"And to think that in spite
of all our pioneering and efforts
to confine her studies to the
New Woman Series our niece
may even now have tasted of
the tree and be bursting out
into throbbing nerve-centres
and palpable possibilities.
Compare we two with her!
Have you noted her restless
craving after Philistine de-
lights such as man-worship
and a literary style? Thank
Heaven, she never got that
from us or our books."
The speakers were a pair of
old Purgatorial Twins, not
without alleviations, designed
by Nature to multiply. But
aloofness, coupled in harness
with ;iM:i'mu, h:nl nipped the
wilding shoots in the Dud and
won hands down at the dis-
tance. True, in the scraggy
past, there had been a male
creature, less curate than
Cupid, that each of them had
saved her soul alive in the
memory of. But the cares of
celibacy, cruel-heavy as a
portmanteau - metaphor, now
weighed on their shoulders;
they could not crush them
with a burial-spade like com-
plete natures; they stamped
their faces (the cares did the
twins' faces) with their pon-
derous crow's feet.
Still, at times, like spring-
cleanings, came spring-hanker-
ings. A whiff of yellow tulip
on the breeze, and they would

dying day the twins never
forgot the smell, or ceased
from the pain of their in-
capacity to grasp the fresh,
unmellowed point of view.
Points of view are the very
dickens.
At last she got less rigid,
and became nasty in soft,
sweet, labial gutturals, like
the whoop of a bull-frog on
the sleepy pool just above the
dam.
"Is this well-born and well-
bred in vou, I ask?" There
was a defiant abasement in
her tone. "Of course you
can't help it. You never
loved! Pooh!"
The two elder Miss DEM-
NINGS crushed the fledgling
secret of the late curate into
its nest, and vituperated till
they fell short of matter,
being but poorly winded.
"Unregenerate—abandoned—
viper—alleviator! Pass from
our twin presence!"
MAKI.CIUNK moved toward
the door; then, by a quaint
habit that was a third nature
to her (she had two others),
she stood there absently, ajar
and aloof. Her air of distinc-
tion came right out through
her wretched frock. Then she
went to the drawing-room,
singeing her Pagan cheek
with the smouldering volume,
her young, expansive brain
hot with the thought that
there were no other copies in
the village. "Unless he sends
for another from town I shall
never be able to keep up my
unreasoning, palpitating ec-
stasy. I must have some
ventilation for my inevitable-
ness, or burst."
She rang for fresh tea. The
crumpets were crystal-cold.
She tasted one, and had a
qualm, as if her sympathies
drink in the sunlight and the flowers and the beas>ts and the fishes were getting'enlarged. ForTa* moment she wondered what a head-
and the dew and the early worm. ache such as she had read about in books could be like. The next.
Even now as they peered into this book of forbidden sentiment at she was down by the trout-stream, familiar in all she-notes, and lay

tangibly the cloven hoof, and coming to her better self with a
strangled " Oh!" she oast the book into the stove of the Queen Anne
parlour, so suggestive of their own aloofness, void as it was of dog or
waste-paper basket, or English grammar, or any such humanizing
influence.
At that moment a pair of swift, Pagan feet sounded iu the passage.
CHAPTER II.
When MAHGERINE entered there was the usual family
aloofness in her face., but also a new element of allevia-
tion. Always plastic a% the compound from which she
derived her name she had now reached five feet seven
and a half inches, and from the crest of her unutterably
pullulating womanhood could afford to look down imper-
sonally on her maiden aunts as they struggled in the
trough like square pegs in a round hole.
The spectacle of burning leather was in her nostrils,
and the vile smell of it gave her an insight into the
situation. Plunging her Aunt's best silver-plated sugar-
tongs into the flames, she rescued her shrivelled treasure,
waved it above the coming tempest like a brand, and
faced them, rigid with wrath, half-seas-over with the
iflamour of things.
An odd, earnest, ineffable look jumped into her eyes,
changing their grey to pitch-black, with patches of

hunting-field, a nurse, a complicated kiss, a proposal, marriage,
disillusionment, in the order named. A poorer, singlerman, with
the same prancing tip-toe spirit, would have lost all sense of
decency, and written a book. But being rich, and, by profession,
married, he also was on his way to the usual trout-stream.

HI.—THK PUBLIC MEETING.
I PROMISED last week that the third chapter
should be devoted to my meeting, and a Wnr-
KINS'S word is aa good aa his bond, in point of
fact, if anything a trifle better. But I think I
ought first to mention that since the account of
my interview with Mrs. LET-HAM HAVITT and
Mrrt. An 111,1: MABCH appeared in print, I have
been subjected to the annoyance of receiving an
anonymous letter. I should be the last to suggest
that either of these ladies, for whom my admira-
tion is equalled only by my respectful awe, had
anything to do with this missive, but here is what
it contained. "it is easy to jeer at Woman, but
be warned in time. Her day will come. Already,
Councils tremble at her word. Treat Woman
with respect, or it will be the worse for you."
These last words were written in red ink. I con-
fess I "m not easily frightened, but I don't likt
this kind of thing. And all my wife says is that
it serves me right for getting mixed up in thest
public affairs at my time of life, and that I ought
to know better.
"You're not fitted for it, TIMOTHY," she says,
"and you'11 only be made a fool for your pains.
I am very fond of my wife, but I wished she
wasn't a prophetess.
It is time to come to the meeting. It was held
in the Voluntary Schoolroom, granted to me by
the Vicar, on the express condition that I should
be strictly non-political. The room was crammed
with persons, men and women, married and single.
girls. BLACK BOB and his mates
were there, in solid rows, whilst Mrs.
HAVTTT and Mrs. MABCH both turned
up, attended by body-guards—the
one of Women Liberals, the other
of Primrose Leaguers. When the
Chairman rose at half-past seven it
is no exaggeration to say that the
-cone was striking and impressive.
Then, two minutes later, I rose, and
commenced my magnum oput of
oratory. I had fifty-two psgei of
notes, I drank six glasses of water,
and twenty-three people left before I
had done, which was not until an
hour and five minutes had elapsed.
[ don't for a moment complain that
twenty-three left; my complaint is
that the number was so few. My
peroration, to which I had devoted
days of care, somehow hardly had the
effect I had hoped for.
"Thisis indeed a memorable year,"
[ said; " a year of _truly rural sig-
nificance. It remains with, you to
show that you are prepared to rise to
the height of the occasion. If you
do this, if you gra^p firmly the bene-
fits which this Act offers you, then
when next New Year's Day the
gladsome bells ring out once again
to tell a listening world that one
year is dead and that another lives,
they will sound all the clearer, all the
more joyous, because they ring in a
vear in which Mudford will have a
Parish Council."
Then I tat down, amidst subdued
ipplause, which, I admit, disap-
pointed me. The Vicar's daughters
never even took the trouble to
applaud at all, and both seemed to
have something to confide to their
handkerchiefs. Black BOB whis-
pered to his neighbour, "Laying it
on thick to-night, isn't he?" I
wonder what he meant.
After this commenced a torrent of
questions, forty-six in all before they
were done. May I never live to have
iuch another experience! All the
points I had evaded, because I had
not understood them, came up with
hardly a single exception. One man
isked, "Can the Parish Council re-
move the parson?" — a most em-
barrassing question, which evoked
roars of laughter from the audience,
and a look of indignation from the
Vicar. And the awful conundrums!
-most of which I had to content
myself with giving up. Here is one.
''Supposing only eight people come
to the Parish Meeting, and a Parish
Council of seven has to be elected,
and suppose seven of the eight are
nominated for election, and the seven
tire elected chairmen of the Meeting
in succession, and have all to retire
because they are candidates for the
Council, and suppose the eighth man
cannot read or write, and when he's
proposed as chairman, goes home, how
will the Parish Council be elected?"
[ simply eaid I would consult my
lawyer, and, if necessary, take
counsel's opinion.
Of course there was a vote of
thanks, and of course it was csnied.
When I got home, my wife, who had
declined to go, asked me how it had
all gone off. "My dear MABIA," was
all I said; "you are quite right.
A man at my time of life ought
never to start taking part in public

affairs."

THE DOOM OF THE MINOR
POETS.
WHRN Minor Poets grew so
rife,
They found a Minor Poet's life
Was very little fun.
The Spirit of the Age they
prayed
They might be melted down,
and made
Into a Majoi one.
Each had a very little spark
Of irenius, that in the dark
Might clearly be discerned.
But in a universal glare!
Who could perceive a rush-
light, where
By myriads they burned?
The Spirit heard the prayer
they urged,
That all their merits might be
merged
In one enduring Fame:
"Yet, ere you all are whelmed
and gone.
You," she declared, "must
fix upon
The Major Poet's name."
Uprose a mighty clamour then,
For SMITH proposed the cogno-
men
Of SMITH, in ardent tones.
"More suitable for high re-
nown,"
Cried BROWN, "appears the
name of BROWN.
JONES advocated JONES.
Expecting yet some verdict
clear,
The Spirit waited half a year.
Then spread her wings and
fled,
But ere she fled, pronounced
'hi* curse:

got up and published by GEORGE ALLAN. Turning from these very
early nineteenth century attractions, I find A Battle and a Boy
staring at me from a brilliant red binding. The colour suggests a
gory fight, but there is nothing martial about it, only a Tyrolean
peasant-boy in a pugilistic attitude with another boy. He is having
it out before starting on his battle of life, which, taking place in the
gay Tyrol, where things happen out-of-the-way, BLANCHE WILLIS
HOWARD has made it more interesting than an every-day fight.

Most young women nowadays like to be here, there, and every-
where, and so you will find them in the Fifty-two Stories of Girl-life,
by some of our best women writers, and edited by ALFRED H. MILES.
Messrs. HUTCHINSON who, publish this work, might head their adver-
tisement with " Go for Miles—and you won't find anything better
than this." Other jokes on "miles" they may discover or invent
for themselves. These are mostly for our big girls, but the little
ones will find a gorgeously gay Rosebud Annual for 1895, quite
a prize-flower, exhibited by JAM us CLARK & Co.; whilst Rosy Mite;
or, the Witch's Spell, by VERA PETROWNA JBLIBHOVSKY,—this is a
nice easy name to ask for!—is a most thrilling nursery tale of how a
little girl, who ought to be an arithmetician after being reduced to
the size of her little finger, is able to subtract much adventurous
interest from among the insects and the insect-world, and is full of
undivided wonders.
The illustrations, by
T. PJM, show how

proclivities," he adds, in a sentence that recalls struggles in the
house in Windsor Terrace, City Road, where David Copperfleld was
a lodger, "were seriously hampered by the collapse of the family

(or unfortunately) Mr. Micawber does not last long. After the first
chapter his hand is rarely seen, he probably, the God of Day

most marvellous lives the world has known. Much of it is told in

FIRST IMPRESSIONS.
FLORENCE is undoubtedly one of the best places in the world for
studying pictures. Resolve to visit the Pitti Palace. Now I shall
see something like a palace—the home of the MEDICI, adorned with
all the beauty of architecture and sculp-
ture which they loved so well! No
monotonous, painted barrack like Buck-
ingham Palace, no shabby brick house
like St. James'p. And now I shall see a
collection of pictures worthily housed in
a magnificent building I No contemptible
piece of architecture like our National
Gallery, where you fall over the staircase
directly you go in at the door, and where,
when you have recovered yourself, you
find three staircases, facing you like the
heads of Cerberus at another entrance, and
always go up the wrong one, and have to ,
come down again and clamber np another Cook 8 Tour °e * orce'
before you find what you want. Even then, if you seek the water-
colours of the greatest English landscape painter, you must go down
yet another staircase into the cellar.
Ascertain the position of the Pitti Palace, and stroll gently
towards it. There is plenty of time, for the daylight will last
another three hours. Cross the Ponte Vecchio, and reach a large
open space opposite a magnificent jail. Yes! Even the jails here
are magnificent! Continue strolling on until I arrive at the open
country. Ask the way to the Palace, and am told that it is about
two kilometres back along the way I have come. Curious that I should
not have noticed it. Return, looking carefully right and left, but do
not see it anywhere, and again arrive opposite the jail. Ask a man I
meet how that prison calls itself. He informs me courteously that it
is the Palazzo Pitti. That! That dUmal, monotonous, gloomy,
brown structure? Why, Buckingham Palace is a joy for ever com-
pared to it, and even Wormwood Scrubbs Prison reveals unsuspected
charms! Would like to sit down to recover from the shock, but as
one is more likely to find a public seat in a London square than in an
Italian piazza, this is impossible. Therefore, totter to the great
central entrance. Perhaps the grand staircase leading to the galleries
may be as attractive as the exterior ia
forbidding.
Discover that the entrance to the
n'leries is by a small side door, where
eave my walking-stick, and climb
a narrow, steep staircase. Then climb
a narrower and steeper staircase, and
finally reach a staircase so steep and
narrow that it might more accurately
be called a ladder. Begin to think I
have mistaken the way. Perhaps I
shall find myself in the attics of the
Palace, and be arrested as an anarch-
ist. Have left my stick below, and
have not even a passport with which
to protect myself. Step cautiously
up the first rounds of the ladder,
when suddenly a large body com-
pletely fills the space above, and
comes slowly down. It is impossible
to go on; it is impossible to remain
where I am. Must therefore go down to the last narrow staircase,
and wait till the obstruction has passed. Do so. Awful pause

As over London Bridge I went
A constable I spied:
His head upon his breast was bent,
Against the parapet he leant,
He gazed upon the stream intent.
And as I passed he sighed.
"What ails thee, officer?" I cried
In sympathetic tone.
1' What sorrow in thy soul is bred?
Nay, never shake thy mournful
head,
But tell me of thy woes instead—
Thou shall, not weep alone."
He eyed me for a moment's space
In half-suspicious doubt;
But reading not a single trace
Of aught but pity in my face,
He told me of his hapless case
And poured his sorrows out.
"Time was, not many months
ago"—
His voice began to quiver—
"When, in a stately march and
slow,
The tide of traffic used to flow
In floods as full as that below "—
He pointed to the river.
"From early dawn to dewy night
It still blocked up the way:
The creaking wain, the hansom
light
The gaudy bus, in colours bright,
The gilded coach, the buggy slight,
And e'en the donkey-shay.

stand,
I watched them come and go.

know?what your "but still" implies—why did I not foresee that he

two—until I had gone, in fact.
Lady Maisie. Then you didn't wish to spare At* feelings as well
as ours?
Und. To be quite frank, I didn't trouble myself about him; my
sole object was to retreat with dignity; he had got himself somehow
or other into a false position he must get out of as best he could.
After all, he would be none the worse for having filled My place for
a few hours.
Lady Maine (slowly). I see. It didn't matter to you whether he
was suspected of being an impostor, or made to feel uncomfortable,
or—or anything.

Und. (renn-ering his sang-

heard of it from any other quarter.
Lady Maisie. Of course not.
And; did he tell you that 'she was
here, in this very house?
. Und. No, he never mentioned
that. |What a singular coinci-
dence!
Lady Maisie. Yes, rather. The
worst of it is that the foolish girl
seems to have heard that he was a
guest here, and jumped to the
conclusion that he had ceased to
care for her; so she revenged her-
self'by a desperate flirtation with
some worthless wretch she met in
such mental provender as, for example, the vapid and inane common-
places of that swaggering carpet-soldier, Captain—THICKSET, isn't it?
Lady Maisie (draiping back into her corner). You evidently don't
know that Captain THICKNESSE distinguished himself greatly in the
Soudan, where he was very severely wounded.
Und. Possibly; but that is scarcely to the point. I do not ques-
tion his efficiency as a fighting animal. As to his intelligence,
perhaps, the less said the better.
Lady Maisie (contracting her brows). Decidedly. I ought to have
mentioned at once that Captain THICKNESSE is a very old friend of
mine.
Und. Really? lie, at least, may be congratulated. But pray
don't think that I spoke with any personal animus; I merely happen
to entertain a peculiar aversion for a class whose profession is sys-

NEW DIRECTOR TO ROYAL COLLEGE or Music.—" Who would

to the inquiry was, "Who but PARRY?" Whereupon HUBERT
PARRY was appointed. Now, all music at the College, of whatever
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
SoME'people are disposed to deny to |Mr. GLADSTONE a sense oi
humour. They will surely reconsider their judgment in view of
the fact that the late PREMIER made the author of Work and Wages
(LONGMANS) a Lord-in-waiting to the QUEEN. The volume contains
in) handy form a series
of addresses and papers
spoken and written by
Lord BRASSEY during the
last quarter of a century.
They disclose profound
knowledge, not only of the
principles that underlie
the connection between
Work and Wages, but of
the everyday practices
that sometimes control it.
Throughout, the book is
marked by a broad spirit
and statesmanlike view
which, if more common,
would make strikes much
more uncommon. As Mr.
GEORGE HOWELL in his
introduction points out,
when in 1869 the young
member for Hastings (not yet Lord BRASSEY) addressed the House of
Commons on the subject of Trade Unions there were very few members
who knew anything about the subject, except that they did not like
it. Mr. BRASSEY, the son of one ot the greatest employers of labour
of the day, had the breadth of mind to recognise the nght of industrial
organisation representing labour, and lived to see the ban against
trades unions removed by the House of Commons. The book is, my
Baronite says, the most valuable contribution to the intricate
question discussed of any recently published. Truly a most remark-
able work for an ex-lofd-in-waiting. We shall next hear of Mr.
"BOBBY" SPENCER coming out with a treatise on the Solar
Parallax.
"With delight," writes a young Baronite. "the ordinary schoolboy
turns fr jm even Old ^Esop s words of wisdom to the ever-blissful

fascinations of cowboys, Red Indians, and all the untrammelled
pleat-ures of ranch life which are to be met with in following The
Great Cattle Trail, by EDWARD S. ELLIS (CASSELL & Co.); and
certainly life appears very, so very interesting, when you can be a
hero with Buffalo Bill effect."
Five Stars in a Little Pool, by EDITH CARRINGTON (CASSELL & Co.),
suggests lives and billiards, but that is the wrong cue to give, except
that it is five little stories in black on white, "red" is added when
you 've finished the book.
CASSELL & Co. evidently, or, says a Baronite fresh from school,
"Ortdently " put a new construction on "Ars est celare Artem,"
for in their Magazine of Art it is clearly shown not only what Art
does but how it does it. The etchings and photogravures are charm-
ing. There is a capital article on stage costumes, and among them
is found the original idea out of which the fashionable Serpentine
dance was twirlingly evolved.
Most little people will be much amused by the waggish tale of
Toby, by ASCOTT R. HOPE. He is not of course Mr. Punch's
"Toby," cela va sans dire. There cannot be two Tobies. It is
"Toby or not Toby," and there is no " question" about it. This
Toby, to whom the Toby never stood godfather, gives us the benefit
of his amusing opinions. He is brought out by INNES (& Co.), and is
one of the daintiest dogs in the Dainty Book Series. So much for
Toby.
Any who read the first series of Eighteenth Century Vignettes, by
AUSTIN DOBSON, will eagerly welcome a second series issued by the
same publishers, Messrs. CHATTO AND WINDUS. Of all writers at
work to-day, Mr. AUSTIN DOHSON in most profoundly steeped in the
literary essence of the Eighteenth Century, and is most successful in
reproducing its flavour. In writing about SWIFT, RICHARDSON,
Dr. JOHNSON, or the topography of HUMPHREY CLINKER (a learned,
yet most mellow disquisition), he does not condescend to the easily-
acquired trick of introducing archaic words, or inverting sections of
phrases with which we are familiar in the works of some other
artists on the same broad pavement. Yet, withal, there is in the
literary style of these pleasant chats round about the old writers,
bookselUrs and bookbuyers, a certain distinct Eighteenth Century
flavour. So intimate is Mr. DOBSON with the ways, the personal
appearance, the dress, the daily environment, and the little gestures
of the more or less mighty dead, that he is able to recall them to
startlingly vivid life. His picture of SWIFT writing to STKLLA from
liis bed in the back room of a first floor in Bury Street, St. James's, is
a masterpiece of live portraiture.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
SoMEf"people are disposed to deny to [Mr. GLADSTONE a sense of
humour. They will surely reconsider their judgment in view of
the fact that the late PREMIER made the author of Work and Wages
(LONGMANS) a Lord-in-waiting to the QUEEN. The volume contains
in (handy form a series
of addresses and papers
spoken and written by
Lord BRASSEY during the
last quarter of a century.
They disclose profound
knowledge, not only of the
principles that underlie
the connection between
Work and Wages, but of
the everyday practices
that sometimes control it.
Throughout, the book is
marked by a broad spirit
and statesmanlike view
which, if more common,
would make strikes much
more uncommon. As Mr.
GEORGE HOWELL in his
introduction points out,
when in 1869 the young
member for Hastings (not yet Lord BRASSEY) addressed the House of
Commons on the subject of Trade Unions there were very few members
who knew anything about the subject, except that they did not like
it. Mr. BRASSEY, the son of one of the greatest employers of labour
of the day, had the breadth of mind to recognise the right of industrial
organisation representing labour, and lived to see the ban against
trades unions removed by the House of Commons. The book is, my
Baronite says, the most valuable contribution to the intricate
question discussed of any recently published. Truly a most remark-
able work for an ex-lord-in-waiting. We shall next hear of Mr.
"BOBBY" SPENCER coming out with a treatise on the Solar
Parallax.
"With delight," writes a young Baronite. "the ordinary schoolboy
turns frjm even Old ^Esop 8 words of wisdom to the ever-blissful
fascinations of cowboys, Red Indians, and all the untrammelled
pleasures of ranch life which are to be met with in following The
Great Cattle Trail, by EDWARD S. ELLIS (CASSELL & Co.); and
certainly life appears very, so very interesting, when you can be a
hero with Buffalo Bill effect."
Five Stars in a Little Pool, by EDITH CARRINGTON (CASSELL & Co.),
suggests lives and billiards, but that is the wrong cue to give, except
that it is five little stories in black on white, "red" is added when
you 've finished the book.
CASSELL & Co. evidently, or, says a Baronite fresh from school,
OnWently " put a new construction on "Ars est celare Artem,"
for in their Magazine of Art it is clearly shown not only what Art
does but how it does it. The etchings and photogravures are charm-
ing. There is a capital article on stage costumes, and among them
is found the original idea out of which the fashionable Serpentine
dance was twirlingly evolved.
Most little people will be much amused by the waggish tale of
Toby, by AscoTT R. HOPE. He is not of course Mr. Punch's
"Toby, cela va sans dire. There cannot be two Tobies. It is
"Toby or not Toby," and there is no "question" about it. This
Toby, to whom the Toby never stood godfather, gives us the benefit
of his amusing opinions. He is brought out by INNES (& Co.), and is
one of the daintiest dogs in the Dainty Book Series. So much for
Toby.
Any who read the first series of Eighteenth Century Vignettes, by
AUSTIN DOBSON, will eagerly welcome a second series issued by the
same publishers, Messrs. CHATTO AND WINDUS. Of all writers at
work to-day, Mr. AUSTIN DOTSSON it most profoundly steeped in the
literary essence of the Eighteenth Century, and is most successful in
reproducing its flavour. In writing about SWIFT, RICHARDSON,
Dr. JOHNSON, or the tooography of HUMPHREY CLINKER (a learned,
yet most mellow disquisition), he does not condescend to the easily-
acquired trick of introducing archaic words, or inverting sections of
phrases with which we are familiar in the works of some other
artists on the same broad pavement. Yet. withal, there is in the
literary style of these pleasant chats round about the old writers,
booksellers and bookbuyers, a certain distinct Eighteenth Century
flavour. So intimate is Mr. DOBSON with the ways, the personal
appearance, the dress, the daily environment, and the little gestures
of the more or less mighty dead, that he is able to recall them to
startlingly vivid life. His picture of SWIFT writing to STKLLA from
his bed in the back room of a first floor in Bury Street, St. James's, is
a masterpiece of live portraiture.

PART XXII.—A DESCENT FROM THE CLOUDS.
XXXII.—In the Elizabethan Garden. TIME—About
11 A.M. • LADY MAISIE and UNDEBSHELL are on a seat in the
Yew Walk.
Lady Mnisie (softly). And you really meant to go away, and never
let one of us know what had happened to you!
Undershell (to himself}. How easy it is after all to be a hero!
(Aloud.) That certainly was my intention, only I was—er—not
permitted to carry it out. I trust you don't consider I should have
been to blame?

I could possibly do that! I
splendid it was of him!
(To herself.) j He doesn't even!see how
Und. (to himself). I begin to believe that I can do no wrong in her
eyes! (Aloud.) It was not altogether easy, believe me, to leave ' or—or anything,
without even having seen your
face; but I felt so strongly that
it was better soi
I.mh/ Maisie (looking down).
And—do you still feel that?
Und. I must confess that I am
well content to have failed. It
was such unspeakable torture to
think that you, Lady MAISIE,
you of all people, would derive
your sole idea of my personality
from such an irredeemable vul-
garian as that veterinary surgeon
—the man SPTJKRELL!
Lady Maisie (to herself, with
an almost imperceptible start). I
suppose it's only natural he
should feel like that—but I wish
—I do wish he had put it just a
little differently! (Aloud.) Poor
Mr. SPTJRRELL; perhaps he was
not exactlv
Und. Not exactly.' I assure
yon, it is simply inconceivable to
me that, in a circle of any preten-
sions to culture and rehnement,
an ill-bred boor like that could
have been accepted for a single
moment as—I won't say a Man
of Genius, but

out of her eyes). No, don't— don't
go on, Mr. BLAIR! We were all
exceedingly stupid, no doubt, but
you must make allowances for us
—for me, especially. I have had
so few opportunities of meeting
people wnoare really distinguished
—in literature, at least. Most of
the people I know best are—well,
not exactly clever, you know. I
so often wish I was in ft set that
cared rather more about intellec-
tual things!
Und. (with infinite pity). How

Wyvern. Suppose we go back to Mr. SPUERELL. I know, of course,
that, in leaving him in ignorance as you did, yon acted from the best
and highest motives'; but still
Und. It is refreshing to be so thoroughly understood! I think I
knowTwhat your "but still" implies—why did I not foresee that he
would infallibly betray himself before long? I did. But I gave
him credit for being able to sustain his part for another hour or
two—until I had gone, in fact.
Lady Maisie. Then you didn't wish to spare his feelings as well
as ours?
Und. To be quite frank, I didn't trouble myself about him: my
sole object was to retreat with dignity; he had got himself somehow
or other into a false position he must get out of as best, he could.
After all, he would be none the worse for having filled My place for
a few hours.
Lady Maisie (slowly). I see. It didn't matter to you whether he
was suspected of being an impostor, or made to feel uncomfortable,

"Do come and search for snowdrops!"
Wasn't that a little unfeeling of you?
Und. Unfeeling! I allowed
him to keep my evening clothes,

places of that swaggering carpet-soldier, Captain—THICKSET, isn't it?
Lady Maisie (drairing back into her corner). You evidently don't
know that Captain THICKNBSSE distinguished himself greatly in the
Soudan, where he was very severely wounded.
Und. Possibly; but that is scarcely to the point. I do not ques-
tion his efficiency as a fighting animal. As to his intelligence,
perhaps, the less said the better.
Lady Maisie (contracting her brows). Decidedly. I ought to have
mentioned at once that Captain THICKITESSE is a very old friend of
mine.
Und. Really? He, at least, may be congratulated. But pray
don't think that I spoke with any personal animus; I merely happen
to entertain a peculiar aversion for a class whose profession is sys-
tematic slaughter. In these Democratic times, when Humanity is
advancing by leaps and bounds towards International Solidarity,
soldiers are such grotesque and unnecessary anachronisms.
Lady Maisie (to herself, with a little shirer). Oh, why does he—
why does he? (Aloud.) I should have thought that, until war
itself is an anachronism, men who are willing to fight and die for
much afraid, have completely turned her head!

B. Lion. Thougn our respective dens are

R. Bear. Why, I like you immensely, now
I see you near.
B. Lion. And I 'm enormously taken with
you. at. close quarters.
R. Bear. You have little of the Lion but
its magnanimous courage.
B. Lion. And yon nave nothing of the
Bear but its skin.
R. Bear. The kind things you have been
saying about me lately have, quite touched
me.
B. Lion. Don't mention it. You deserved
'em all. Delighted to render any little civili-
ties to a near neighbour, especially in time of
trouble.
R. Bear (much movtd). A thousand
thanks! Leo! Let me embrace you. No
longer afraid of my hug, are you?

British Greeting !•!!"

B. Lion (aloud). Well, let us meet often,
Bruin, and talk things over amicably.
R. Bear (aloud). We will, Leo, we will.
Ah! ir/nit a pity we didn't know each other
before!
B. Lion. Yes, indeed. However, All's
well that ends well!
R. Bear. "All's Well;!" Ah! Cue for
song! Let us warble!
They sing .—
Converted (rather late than soon),
We peace proclaim,—thrice blessed boon!
We meet, as friends, on common ground;
On sentry go no more tramp round;
And should our footsteps haply stray,
Where treaties mark the warded way,—
"Who goes there?"—
Stranger quickly tell,—
"A friend!"
"The word!"
"Comrades."'
"ALL'S WELL!"
Or, steaming on the briny deep,
Watch each on each we scarce need keep
From off the ironclad's steel deck,
Lest mutual foes meet common wreck.
Lord, no! If a strange hull draw near,
A friendly voice salutes each ear.

OTJR neighbour has many Colonies. The
Colonies of our neighbour are very productive.
Why should we not have (some) productive
Colonies? The cock is more valiant than the
lion. Let us send the Ambassador to the bad
Queen. The bad Queen has pulled the nose
of the Ambassador. She is very obstinate,
but she is not very amiable. The soldiers,
the sailors, the ships, the stores, and the
ammunition will soon arrive. The island has
a very good noil, but not a very good climate.
Why have the soldiers and the sailors not
yet marched to the capital? Because the
soldiers and the sailors have all got the fever.
Why have they got the fever? Because our
neighbour is wicked. Does it rain like this
every day? Yes, it rains every day in the
wet season. Which, then, is the dry season
in the island? There is no dry season in the
island. It is right to live for glory. There
in much glory in shooting barbarians. When
the island is conquered, who will go and live
in it? My tailor, my butcher, my wife's
mother (the mother of my wife), and all my
creditors, I hope, will go and live in it- We
are not so rich as we once were. Why are
we not so rich as we once were? Because we
have spent all pur money in trying to have
bi|? Colonies like our neighbour. If our
neighbour is so wicked, why should^ we
imitate him? He is only wicked because he
something like a " Russian Advance!! 1"
has (the) big Colonies.

Kiel Hussars, and saying, too, that his bride

THE NOVELIST'S VADE MECUM.
<Compiled by a Publisher with strong vieies

Question. Which do you prefer—a
novel in three volumes, or in one tingle
tome?
Answer. That is a matter that entirely
depends upon terms.
Q. Then yon are indifferent as to
length?
1 'A. In everything save the figures of a
cheque.
Q. But is not Art your first considera-
tion?
A. Certainly, when it leads to a sub-
stantial balance at my bankers.
Q. Then you write foriyour living?
A. Certainly, or I shouldn't live at all.
Q. Which do you prefer—a story pro-
duced in parts, or a story published as
a whole?
A. Again a question of terms. Still, if
remuneration is equal, sketches of charac-
ter are easier than construction of plot.
Q. When is the latter necessary f
A. When the novel is written for a
serial, and is published with the standing
announcement (frequently repeated), "to
be continued in our next."
Q. Is it difficult to sketch character?
A. Not if you do not mind irritating
your friends and driving your foes into
lunacy.
Q. How do you'irritate your friends?
A. By reproducing in an amusing
manner their peculiarities.
Q. And how do you madden your foes?
A. By passing them over in a dead
silence, and sternly refusing to recognise
their existence.
Q. How should you treat your contem-
poraries?
A. If you appreciate your work at its
proper (that is to say, your own) value,
yon will not admire contemporaries.
Q. And what will you say (>f authors
of the past?
A. That it is fortunate that they did
live in the past, as they certainly do not
exist in tbe present, and will certainly
not revive in the future.
Q. How should you criticise a contem-
porary's novel?
A. If you are sure of his influencing
a criticism of your own work favourably,
praise his romance sky high. If he is,
from a reviewer's point of view, a neglig-
able quantity, why, treat him on that
basis.
Q. Then what is your motto?
A. "Nothing for nothing."
Q. Doyou consider a novelist's life the
best possible form of existence?
A. I should say yes if I did not know
of a form of existence to be even better.
Q. And what is that?
A. Inheriting a fortune, putting your
hands in your pockets, and for the rest
that the Muscovites are on such excellent
of your life doing nothing.

THE CHRONICLES OF A RURAL PARISH.
IV.—ELECTIONEERING.
WHATEVER mv wife may think about my public meeting, and
whatever I may feel ab^ut it myself, one thing is quite certain—that
it has left Mudtord a very different village from what it found it.
When I commmved my great efforts in the cause of citizenship
there was apathy and ignorance amongst the " idiuts"—as my friend
Miss PHIL. BCKTT insists on calling the villagers. Things travel
quickly nowadays, and at the present moment we are all ablaze with
the excitement of electioneering.
I ought to say at once that I nave taken as yet no steps in my own
candidature. I feel that, afier the part I have played in the great
Drama of Village Home Rule, the next move ought to come from
a grateful and appreciative peasantry. In point of fact, I have been
expecting every day, every hour almost, a deputation to ask me to
allow myself to be put in nomination—I fancy that's the correct
phrase. Ro far the deputations have been as conspicuous by their
absence since the meeting as they were annoying by their frequency
before. Another curious fact I have noticed in this. We are to have
a Parish Council of seven. Thus far I have heard of exactly seven
candidates and no more. This means that when I am nominated, as
1 shall be, of course, by all sections of the community (for 1 feel in
my inward heart that it will be " all right on the night ), there will
h« onlv one candidate too many. Who will be the unbuceessf ol one P
I wonder!
Of the sevtn candidates, I should first mention Mrs. LKTIUM
HAVITT and Mr.-. A HULK MARCH. Both of these ladies have started
a vigorous campaign, and—mirabile dictu! (it makes one feel so
literary to introduce every now and again a tag of Latin)—are
running amicably together. At a Parliamentary election it's a case
of war to the knife, but now the lion lies down with the lamb; not
that, for one single instant, would I insinuate that either is a lion,
IT, for the matter of that, a lamb. I should be ashamed to be so
fn'niliar. Mrs. II \ vrrr's placards are everywhere on the walls. The
e feet of contrasts is at times surprising. For instance—
USE r.AXAN-A SOAP
LBTHAM HAVITT
FOB THE PARISH COUNCIL.
Mrs. A HULK MARCH is no less enterprising, and has purple appeals
to you to vote for "th« March of Progress," and "the March of
Ideas." It may be very funny, but I have no patience with making
a joke of such a serious matter. No one, at any rate, can ever
It is announced from the Hall that the Squire has very kindly
consented to stand; the Vicar follows his neighbour's example, and
will no doubt be returned, if for nothing else, as a compliment to his
two charming daughters. (I think I must ask them to canvass fur
me when I come out. My wife declares she won't, and that she
won't let my girls either.) That makes four candidates. The
other three are BLACK BOB and two of his mates, wh'> are claiming
support as the " People's Three."
And now comes, perhaps, the most extraordinary thing of all—
their programme! I find that it is full of the most (so-called)
advanced ideas, but that the plank which seems to be the most
attractive is "Free Trout-fishing!" 1 confess I could hardly
believe my own eyes when I read it. In the first place, it seemed so
farcical. In the second place, the only trout-fishing in the neigh-
bourhood happens to belong to MB! What's more, I don t see any
way out of the difficulty. I met BLACK BOB a day or two ago and
asked him how he ever got such an absurd notion into his head that
the Parish Council had anything to do with trout-fiching. "' It's all
right, Mr. WJNKINS," said he, just remember what Section 8 says."
I said nothing at the time, because I thought as a fact that that section
referred to Boards of Guardians. When 1 looked atthe Act. sure enough
I read, as being one of the powers possetsed by the Parish Council—
"(f) To utilue any well, spring, or itream within theirparith" ....
I read no more. I had read enough. How any Parliament can
ever have dared to insert such a monstrous tection I cannot under-
stand. But there it is. "Free trout-fishing!" Well—there ought
to be someone on the Parish Council to defend the rights of property.
I shall be the man.
Next Tuesday the Parish Meeting in the Voluntary Schoolroom at
7.30. It cannot fail to be an eventful night.

Robinson. I suppose I am.

Jones. But still the Russians do take an in-

terms with us, it doesn't much matter what
happens.
Brown. Of course not. Such good taste of
the CZAR to make the Prince a Colonel of the
Kiel Hussars, and saying, too, that his bride
was English, not German. The new Emperor
thoroughly appreciates the value of an English
alliance. And you see France, too, wants to
join it.
Jones. Then that will put everything right
about Egypt, Madagascar, and Afghanistan.
Robinson (emerging from his paper). I never
could see the use of the Suez Canal. No more
could Lord Palmerston. And couldn't we get
to India quite as quickly by the Pacific Rail-
way?
Brown (doubtfully). T think not; although, of
course, it shortens the route to Australia. I
fancy it wouldn't help us much with Egypt.
Jones. Why, the Pacific Railway is in Canada
—isn't it P
Robinson. I suppose it is.
[Returns to the perusal of his paper.
Brown. Not that the Pacific Railway inn't
useful. You see, the Americans are waking
up. and even proposed to intervene in the
have abandoned the old policy of keeping
themselves to themselves.
Jones. Of course that's impossible.
You see that while we are so violently
in favour of free trade, we must take an
interest in transatlantic politics.
Brown. Yes, there is a good deal in
what you say, and I suppose on account
of the fall in silver we all must be care-
ful.

THE NOVELIST'S VADE MECUM.
(Compiled by a Publisher with strong views
on the Subject.)
Question. Which do you prefer—a
novel in three volumes, or in one single
tome''
Answer. That is a matter that entirely
depends upon terms.
Q. Then you are indifferent as to
length?
J 'A. In everything save the figures of a
cheque.
Q. But is not Art your first considera-
tion?
A. Certainly, when it leads to a sub-
stantial balance at my bankers.
Q. Then you write foriyour living P
A. Certainly, or I shouldn't live at all.
Q. Which do you prefer—a story pro-
duced in parts, or a story published as
a whole?
A. Again a question of terms. Still, if
remuneration is equal, sketches of charac-
ter are easier than construction of plot.
Q. When is the latter necessary?
A. When the novel is written for a
serial, and is published with the standing
announcement (frequently repeated), "to
be continued in our next."
Q. Is it difficult to sketch character?
A. Not if you do not mind irritating
your friends and driving your foes into
lunacy.
Q. How do you'irritate your friends P
A. By reproducing in an amusing
manner their peculiarities.
Q. And how do you madden your foes?
A. By passing them over in a dead
silence, and sternly refusing to recognise
their existence.
Q. How should you treat your con tem-
poraries?
A. If you appreciate your work at its
proper (that is to say, your own) value,
yon will not admire contemporaries.
Q. And what will you say (i authors
of the past?
A. That it is fortunate that they did
live in the past, as they certainly do not
exist in the present, and will certainly
not revive in the future.
Q. How should you criticise a contem-
porary's novel?
A. If you are sure of his influencing
a criticism of your own work favourably,
praise his romance sky high. If he is,
from a reviewer's point of view, a neglig-
able quantity, why, treat him on that
basis.
Q. Then what is your motto?
A. "Nothing for nothing."
Q. Do you consider a novelist's life the
best possible form of existence?
A. I should say yes if I did not know
of a form of existence to be even better.
Q. And what is that P
A. Inheriting a fortune, putting your
hands in your pockets, and for the rest
that the Muscovites are on such excellent
of your life doing nothing.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS.
(CONTINUED.)
LET me collect my scattered senses! Where am I? In Pitti Palace.
On narrow staircase. Probably on forbidden ground. I hear footfall
—descending. Perhaps it may be one of the officials, and I shall be
caught in t he act of attempting to enter the royal attics! What would
be the punishment Y Death, or penal servitude? The gallows or the
galleys f Have happily several one-lira notes in my pocket. If these
are not sufficient, five lire, or even ten
But I shall see what sort of man he is.
Perhaps a few coppers would be enough.
At this moment the obstruction descends,
and I discover that he is a fat German
tourist. For the first time in my life am
pleased to look at a German, though the
cut of this one's clothes is even worse than
usual. Feel inclined to fall upon his neck
/ and murmur "Mahlzeit.'" or "Prosit.'"
f i or some other idiotic exclamation peculiar
rirn , :,; to his country. Fortunately, remember
>£, '/ ',' that these are only said in connection with
'eating or drinking. Perhaps, if I were to
remind him of driiik, after he has spent hours in a dry, hot gallery,
it would not tend to conciliate him. Therefore muster up the half-
dozen words of his awful language which years of anxious study have
enabled me to master in all their complexities of gender, number,
case, declension, conjugation, agreement, government, &c.—not for-
getting the exceptions—and, taking off my hat, ask him if this is the
entrance to the galleries. "Ja wohl," says he. And moreover if I
go up these stairs to the too. "Ja wohl," says he again. Em-
boldened by his courteous affability, I remark that the staircase is
very narrow. "Ja wohl," bays he, for the third time, and passes
on. A very interesting conversation with an intelligent foreigner in
a country where we are both strangers. There is nothing like travel
to enlarge the mind. Besides, one learns so much of foreign languages
when one hears the varied idioms and phrase^ of the natives.
Thus meditating I arrive at the top of the ladder. What a smell
of paint! They are evidently doing up the palace. Turn along a
passage about two feet wide—how that German got through it
has puzzled me ever since—and find myself in a magnificent
studio, tilled with painters, easels, palettes and canvases, and
with the smell of paint. That German deceived me. I have
come to the wrong place after all. Am just about to apologise
and retreat when I perceived a fine old master on the wall. Peeping
amongst the painters, easels, palettes, and cinvases, perceive
other old roasters, almost entirely hidden by the various erections of
the students. At this moment an official rings a small bell. Ask
him if I may be permitted to look at some of the pictures on the
walls, if it would not be interfering with the painters. "Certainly,
signore" navs he. And ask him where the Pitti Gallery is. "It is
here," says he. What? I have reached it at last! But how can
one see anything when the whole place is choked up with these
execrable modern copies and the apparatus to support them? How-
ever, I will see what I can now that I have got here. Happily the
daylight will last tor at least another hour. "But," continues the
official, as I meditate, "it is now four o'clock. The gallery is
closed." A FIHST IMPRESSIONIST.

Yes — tchort vozmi! I mean, confound it! The dvornik here

some shtchi and pirogui at the Gaiety Restaurant! They 've a very
good zakuska there to whet your appetite with!
All right, little brother I ... I say, old man, I can't keep this up
much longer. Let 's chuck it and emigrate!
Where to?
Oh, St. Petersburg, where they 're all talking English now, as a
compliment to our " Prints WALESKI" and " Ghertsog YOBKSKI."
Very well. Ta-ta! do svidanya till to-morrow!
AN ENGAGEMENT.
(A Page from a Diary. )
Monday. —Delightful news! My sister NELLIE is engaged to be
married I It came upon us all as a great surprise. I never had the
slightest suspicion that NELLIE cared twopence about old GOODBODY
ST. I ,K<; UK. He is such a staid, solemn old party,
a regular fossilised bachelor we all thought. Not
it aU the sort of man to give way to emotions or
io be in love. However, it's a capital match for
NELLIE as ST. LKGER'S firm are about the largest
iccountants in the city. My wife thinks it will
t>e a good thing in another way, too, as my other
six sisters may now have a chance of going off. It
seems that when once this kind of epidemic gets
nto a family, all the unmarried sisters go popping
>ff like blazes one after another. Called with my
wife this afternoon to congratulate NELLIE. Rather
a trial for the poor girl, as all sorts of female rela-
tives had called full of enthusiasm and congratu-
lations. GOODBODY was there (NELLIE calls him
"GOODIE ") and seemed rather overwhelmed. He
went away early and didn't kiss NELLLE. I thought
this funny, and chatted NELLIE about it afterwards.
She said she 'd soon make that all right.
Tuesday.— GOODBODY is getting on. We had a family dinner at
home to-night. He came rather late and entered the drawing-room
with an air of great determination, marched straight up to NELLLE
and kissed her violently. It was splendidly done and we all felt in-
clined to cheer. He kissed her again when he went away, and lin-
gered so long in saying good niirht to mv mother that we all thought
he was going to kiss her too. But he didn't. My wife said that the
suspense of those moments was dreadful.
Wednesday. — He has kissed my mother— on both cheeks.
I must say the old lady to»k it extraordinarily well, though she
was not in the very least prepared for it. It happened at five
o'clock tea, in an interval of complete silence, and thoue two
sounding, smacks simply reverberated through the room. Mother
was quite cheerful afterwards, aud spoke to NELLIE about the
trousseau in her usual calm and collected frame of mind. Still
I can see that the incident has made a deep impression upon her.
My wife told MAGOIK it would be her turn next.
Thursday. — It has been MAGGIK'S turn. GOODBODY called at
home on his way from the City, and set to work as soon as he got
into the drawing-room. He first kissed NELLIE, then repeated the
performance with my poor mother, and, finding that MAGGIE was
close be«ide him, he kissed her on the forehead. Where will
this end f
Friday. — He has regularly broken loose. He dined at home
to-day, and, without a word of warning, kissed the whole family —
my mother, NKLLIE, MAGGIE, ALICE, MABEL, POLLY, MAUD, and
little BETA. He quite forgot he had begun with my mother, and,
af'erhe had kissed BETA, got confused, and began all over again.
At this moment my wife and I came in with Aunt CATHERINE whom
we had brought in our carriage. Both iny wife and Aunt CATHERINE
tried to escape, but it was no good. He kissed them both, and was
just advancing towards me, when the butler fortunately announced
dinner. Matters are getting quite desperate, and we none of us
know what ought to be done. Aunt CATHERINE had a violent tit of
hysterics in the spare bedroom after dinner.
Saturday. — The engagement is broken off. A great relief. It
has been a lesson for all of us.

Hullo, the Lyceumski Theatre is closed!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAEI.
A TRIUMPH OF THE SCHOOL
BOARD.
TIIK collector of statistics was
fairly posed by the attitude as-
sumed by his visitor. The elderly
lad (or, rather, very young man)
had claimed admittance on the
score that he was an. "old boy"
of the School Board. He wished
to give his evidence anent the fate
of the State-educated juvenile
population.
And you say you are not one
of the 547 clerks?" queried the
collector.
"No Sir, I am not. I would
rather beg my bread from door to
door than occupy a lofty stool from
dawn to sundown."
"And you are not one of the
413 milkboya?"
"Again, no. It has been a
tradition in our family for cen-
turies to avoid water, so how could
I dabble in the milk trade?"
"And yon are neither an actor,
a jockey, nor a hairdresser?"
"I am not," was again the reply,
couched in a tone of hauteur.
"And you are not a soldier—
one of the ten that left the School
Board for the more or less tented
field?"
"I am not—nor a sailor."
Then the collector of statistics
paused for a moment, and spoke
with a measure of hesitation.
"Youhavenot gonetothe bad?"
"Like my 333 schoolfellows?"
"Yes."
Then the red blood of the visi-
tor mounted to the roots of his
hair and suffused his cheeks with
crimson. He indignantly denied

the imputation. He might be poor,
but at any rate he was honest.
'' No, he had never been in prison."
"Then what are yon ? fl asked
the collectoi, in a tone not entirely
free from traces of annoyance.
"Surely you must be something!"
"I am more than something!"
returned the visitor, proudly. "I
am unique—I am a curiosity."
"What may you be?"
"I am a boy, educated by the
School Board, who is satisfied to
follow in the footsteps of his
father. My father was a brick-
layer, and I am satisfied to lay
bricks myself."
"My dear Sir," said the collec-
tor, grasping him cordially by the
hand, " I congratulate you. This
is the first time I have met a boy
who has been satisfied to adopt
the trade followed by his parent.
And now you can do me a small
favour." And then the collector
engaged his guest to renovate the
walls of his house, which (on ac-
count of the scarcity of trained
labour) had for many years been
sadly out of repair.

THE CHKONICLES OF A RURAL PARISH.
V.—THE PARISH MEETING.
Mudford, December 4, 11.30 P.M.
THE Parish Meeting—long looked for, eagerly expected, anxiously
anticipated—has come and gone. It has been indeed an interesting
and eventful night.
The meeting was called for half-past seven, and, when I reached
the schoolroom, at two minutes before that time, the room was
packed with parochial electors. A subdued cheer broke out as
I entered, and, bowing my acknowledgments, I found my way to a
seat in the front row, which a thoughtful overseer had reserved for
me, his fellow overseer being stationed at the door to see that only
those were admitted who had got on the wedding garment; or, to put
it in a different way, whose names were on the Register. I soon saw
that, practically, everyone was present. There were the MARCHITES,
the LETHAM HAVITTITES, and BLACK Bon and his following, whilst
the Vicar and the Squire were there, to lend an air of real intelligence
and respectability to the whole affair. It never struck me before,
though, how dull a man the Vicar is when you see him without his
daughters—who, of course, were not present.
Punctually at 7.30 the overseer asked the meeting to proceed to
elect a chairman. There was a hush of expectant sUenee, and then
BLACK BOB jumped up and proposed me. Iliad taken a great interest
in the subject, and the tremendous amount 1 knew about it mode me
the most suitable person to take the chair that evening. A warm
glow of satisfaction came over me, whioh deepened into a sense of
burning joy when Mrs. MARCH seconded the motion, which was
agreed to unanimously.
I took the chair, and after a hurried glance at my instructions, in-
vited nominations to be sent in to me. Seven were sent in in the first
two minutes—nominations of the seven who had previously issued
election addresses. Then came an awful and an awkward pause. I
waited, for I had to wait for a quarter of an hour—the instructions
told me to. It was un mauvais quart cTheure, Of course I was
waiting for my own nomination. It is a humiliating fact to have to
record, but it did not come. Then the whole thing became clear to
me; my election to the chair was a sop to console me for being
shunted from the Parish Council. But I was not to be fobbed off in this
way. I put my hand in my pocket, and a minute before the time was
up produced a nomination paper which I had got my gardener and
coachman to sign. It is always well to be prepared for accidents.
However, even bad quarters of an hour oome to an end, and at the
end of the i emaining minute I announced that as I had been nominated
myself, I could not stay in the chair. This was evidently an unex-
pected turn, but Mrs. LETHAM HAVITT was equal to the occasion.
She proposed the assistant-overseer. He was elected, declared all the
eight nomination papers were in order, and then threw the meeting
open to questions.
The heckling began at once. I was the first victim over that con-
founded Free Trout-fishing. Was I in favour of it? I said that as
all there was belonged to me, it was obvious I could hardly be ex-
pected to answer the question. Mrs. A KIII.K MARCH and Mrs. LETHAM
HAVITT said they were prepared to use all the powers the Act con-
ferred as to free fishing. I noticed that a curious smile lurked
round the months of both, and I should have said, if I had not
thought it to be too incredible to be true, that Mrs. MARCH almost
winked her eye. Anyhow, the meeting cheered, and seemed satisfied.
BLACK BOB made a long and impassioned speech, in which he called
the Act the Charter of the Peasants' Liberty. This, too, evoked great
enthusiasm. Finally the questioning flickered out, no one withdrew
their candidature, and the voting commenced. I had previously
noticed that there were 173 electors present. My name—WINKINS—
came last. Marvellous to relate, 173 hands were held up for each of
the first seven candidates—for I thought it only a courteous thing to
vote for my opponents. When my name was put, only 59 hands went
up. It will be noticed that the total number of votes was more than
seven times the number of votes, and no one ought to have voted
more than seven times! The enow of hands was a fraud and a
farce, so it was only in common justice to the parish and myself
that I should demand a poll. A poll I did demand, and we are to
have an election on Monday week.
When I got home I found a letter from the Local Government
Board, referring me on the trout-fishing point to the words of the
Act, to which accordingly I at onoe turned. Then I saw that the
clause was " to utilize any . . . stream within their parish . . . but to
as not to interfere with the rights of any corporation or person . . ."
I had stopped short before at these last words. I understand at last
why Mrs. ARBLE MARCH winked—for wink I now know she did.

Spirit of the Good Old Times lamentelh:—
PICTURESQUE Parish, thankless-hearted
Parish,
Holding a pippin big as a pine-apple.
Came up upon the fourth to judge and vote.
Fronting the dawn he moved; his Sunday
smock
Draping his shoulders, and his sun-burnt
hair
Clustered about his forehead, freshly oiled;
And his cheek hrighten'd as a oheek will
brighten
After brisk towel friction; and my heart
Misgave me as to what might be his game.
He smiled, and opening out his horny palm,
Showed me the fruit of long, tierce party
fight,
The Power-Pippin, and what time I look'd.
And listen'd, his full-flowing river of speech
Came heavy on my heart.
"Wha1 cheer old'Ooman!
Uld frump o' the Old Times as fules ca'd good,
Just twig this fruit 1 It's gotten to be given
'To the most fit." At present thof, 'tis mine,
And added "This wur oast upon the board

Ranged in the Halls of Stephen; wheerupon

But artful 'ENEBY quickly settled that,

'Twas as he said. To woo his voice they came,
Humble they came to that smooth rustic
sward,
And at their feet the daisies seemed to droop
At the un-English, strange, new-fangledness
Of such a notion as for Church, and Land.
And Trade to " tuck their tuppennies in" to
-what?
This rustic Parish, once their humble slave
Now their authoritative arbiter,
And chuckling critic.
Fools to Parish make
Proffer of plenteous power, ample rule
Unquestion'd, overflowing revenue
Wherewith to embellish village state and
make
The rustic home a rural paradise.

So "Passon" says

And nice long sermons, and benevolent doles >
Tendance in sickness, help at marriage-time,
A " gentlemanly presence," crowning Doon!—
At church a happy place—in the free seats,
Behind the pillar, with undying bliss
In knowledge of True-Blue Supremacy.
He ceased, and Parish held the costly fruit
More closely cuddled.
"Varmer " next spake out.
"You know me, HODGE: I woo you not with
gifts.
Long generations have not altered me,
And Parish Meetings shall not. Trust your
boss,
They 're bosh, lad! Judge thou me by what
"I am,
And you will find me fittest. But allow
Those dashed Rad agitators to upset
Our old relations, fill your mind with fudge
Concerning healthier homes and higher wage,
And it's all up with England, Me—and You.'
Tip me the Pippin!"
Parish cocked a snook,
And held the apple tighter.
As for him,
The sleek mild grocer, Parish shut him up
Almost 'ere he had spoken. "I promise thee
A good cheap article and lots of tick"
But Parish said, "Talk not to me of tick I
I shall not need 'un wi my whacking wage,
And ' overflowing revenue'; new cottage,
Allotment patch, three acres and a coo,
And a' the rest o' 't. As for this here Pippin,
I 've grupped at last, 'tis mine, an' I dunno
As I icon t hate first bite at 'an myseP.'"
He spoke and laughed. I shut my eyes in fear,
But when I look'd. Parish had raised his hand.
And 1 beheld the Parson's angry eyes.
The Farmer's furious glance, and, weazel-like,
And I '11 consider ere I pairt wi' un!"
The glittering of the Grocer-man's amaze.
But offers him fair creeds and catechisms.

Lady Maisie (puzzled). She
is very clever at mending lace,
I know, though what that has
to do with it——
Und. Listen to me, Lady
MAISIE. I came to this house
at your bidding. Yes, but for
your written appeal, I should
have treated the invitation I re-
ceived from yonr Aunt with
silent contempt. Had I obeyed
my first impulse and ignored
it, I should have been spared
humiliations and indignities
which ought rather to excite
your pity than—than any other
sensation. Think—try to realise
what my feelings must have been

true I have since learnt that I was mistaken in this particular
instance; but I am not ignorant of the ingrained contempt yon

bitter scorn of Birth for Brains!
Lady Maisie. I am afraid the—the contempt is all on the other
ride; but if that is how you feel about it, I don't wonder that yon
were indignant.
Und. Indignant! I was furious. In fact, nothing would have
induced me to sit down to supper at all, if it hadn't been for
, Lady Maisie (in a small roice). Then, you did sit down P With
the servants! Oh, Mr. BLAIB'!
Und. I thought von were already aware of it. Yes, Lady MAISIE,
I endured even that. But (with magnanimity) you must not

Und. (to himself). She admires me all the more for it. But I
knew she would take the right view! (Aloud, with pathos.) I was
only compelled by absolute starvation. I had had an unusually
light lunch, and I was so hungry!
Lady Maisie (after a pause). That explains it, of course. ... I
hope they gave you a good supper!
TJnd. Excellent, thank yon. Indeed, I was astonished at the
variety and even luxury of the table. There was a pyramid of
quails

something von were going to explain.
Und. I have been endeavouring to explain to the best of my
ability that if I have undesignedly been the cause of—er—a tem-

Oh! If I had known it was
merely that. However, I am
sure I need not ask you to treat
my—my communication in the
strictest confidence, Lady
MAISIE.
Lady Maisie. Indeed, that is
perfectly unnecessary, Mr.
BLAIB.
Und. Yes, I felt from the
first that I could trust you—
even with my life. And I can-
not regret having told you, if it
has enabled you to understand
me more thoroughly. It is such
a relief that you know all, and
that there are no more secrets
between us. You do feel that I
only acted as was natural and
inevitable under the circum-

It was awful. I don't think I ever saw Mamma a deeper shade of

A Strange Career is the title of a book recently issued by
BLACKWOOD, and it sets forth tho life and adventures of JOHN
GIADWTN JEBII. Mr. RIDER HAGGARD supplies an introduction,
in which he testifies touching Mr. JEBB that of "all friends he
was the gentlest and truest, of all men the most trustful." At
first reading this testimony is almost necessary, for so wild were Mr.
JEBB'S adventures in Mexico, so imminent his frequent peril, and so
miraculous his inevitable escape, that one seems to be reading a
work by Mr. Louis STKVENSON, or the author of She. In merit of
graphic power and style the work need not shrink from comparison
even with these masters of the art. It purports to be written by
Mr. JEBB'S widow, but as the lady did not Deoome his wife till his
strange career had several times been nearly brought to an abrupt
close, Mr. JEBB must have been as effective with his pen as he was
of the highest peaks of the Rooky Mountains; the discovery of the
pipe-stem when digging round the snow-submerged site of a hut in
the mountains, a discovery which, carefully followed up, brought to
light "the whiteish-grey fingers of tho dead man closely clutching
the bowl of the pipe' ; the account of the revolt in the streets of the
city of Mexico; and the story of the coach party robbed by bandits
four times in a single day on a
journey from Puebla to Vera Cruz
—these are among the frequent
flashes in one of the most stirring
narratives that has for a long time
come in my Baronite's way.
Evidently "Mars," in return for
our late curiosity, has been keeping
his eye on this gay little planet of
ours. His experiences, published
by the Parisian firm of Plan,
ffourrit et Cie, are piotorially
related in La Vie de Londres.
Needless to remark it was our
Cotes riants which struck him.
The Baron cannot finish his
notes of admiration without giving
one of them, and that a big one, to
Phil May's Annual. That May
should appear to brighten up December fogs is nice in itself: and it
is phill'd with the best of May produce. "Another thing," quoth
the Baron, "about this annual by PHIL MAT is, that all mesfllles
can read it and see it with pleasure."
At this time of year the Baron examines the " Hardy Annuals"
that are heaped upon his table. At the first examination he gives the
apple to the " Pip," i.e., to the The Penny Illustrated Paper, that
is, as represented by it Christmas number called Christmas Cards.
Charming picture, too, of "The Queen of Hearts" photographed
from the life—"may she live long and prosper!"—and the story
re-latey'd by the indefatigable JOHN LATET "will delight the most
insatiable story-devourer," quoth
THE BARON DE BOOK-WORMS.

IMPROVED AND IMPROVING DIALOGUES.
(Arranged on the strictest Lines of Truth.)
At Mrs. SOMEBODY'S on "At Home" Day,
Mrs. Somebody. Well, I am pleased yon have come at last, as I
wanted you to notice that, although you have a slightly better address,
my drawing-room is far larger than your own.
Mrs. Caller. You are most kind to say so; and I may add that
we should not have dreamed to come to this out-of-the-way part of
the world had we not wished to purchase some cheap carpets in the
neighbourhood.
Miss Caller. I suppose your extremely plain daughter ARAMINTA is
away from home; she seldom contrives to hit it off with her mother.
Mrs. Somebody. You have guessed rightly; but I may say that
she is staying at Lady DASHAWAY'S place in the country. I mention
the fact casually, although I am glad to get in a title somehow in
the course of my convert ation.
Mrs Caller. If you are obliging enough to give me the oppor-
tunity. I will get in a dozen persons with handles to their names.
You will pardon the vulgarity?
Mrs. Somebody. Most certainly, as knowing that your father was
a bootmaker in a large way, and your mother the daughter of a
milliner, nothing else could be reasonably expected.
Mrs. Caller. Aware that you may know something of my imme-
diate ancestry, I will leave no stone unturned to find an opening for
some reference to my uncle the curate.
Miss Caller. Being glad to add on every conceivable occasion to
the list of my partners at any promiscuous charity ball that I may
patronise with my presence, I will ask after your eldest un-
married son?
Mrs. Somebody. I thank you, my dear child, but as I intend him
to look rather higher than yourself for a matrimonial alliance, I will
meet your politic inquiry with a pailful of polite cold water.
Mrs. Caller. Having now consumed the regulation cup of cold
weak tea and section of luke-warm muffin, I will say good-bye, and
take my departure. But before leaving I will make special reference
to my brougham.
Miss Caller. And I will add my adieur, after giving a good long
.ook at your hair, which seems to require attention at the roots.
Mrs. Somebody. I will warmly speed your parting, reflecting the
while, as a sop to my wounded feelings, that you are both looking
dreadfully old, and that your conveyance is merely a hired brougham.
So doubt your stay would have been longer if the charge per hour
:iad been what your vulgarian of a husband and father (who, thank
with his gun. The picture of the eclipf e of the sun seen from one
goodness, has not called) would term " easier."

earlier than was ever known; 11.35 A.M., and apparently nobody up
yet. The i-etturino loudly cracks his whip, but to no purpose.
Suddenly I notice some electric bell-pushes. Ring one. Ring

elegant gentleman, probably the manager, who excitedly endeavours
to speak, and to apologise, in four languages at once. Reduce him
to calmness, and to two languages, with a few words from a third

excellently too. and go off to see the sights.
Unfortunately am seized with an insane wish to ascend the
Leaning Tower, when I might have remained comfortably on
the beautiful turf at the foot of it. Rouse the official at the door.
He says I cannot go up alone. Remember that sort of trick,
so tell him he may accompany me. He says he must stay below.
Remember also that sort of trick, and offer him a lira. He is
still unconvinced I Do not remember any trick of that sort. An
extraordinarv cuttode! What will convince him? Am just ask-
ing where I can find a companion, when a small, quiet man
strolls up. For fifty oentesimi he will accompany me. That's
cheap enough, so follow him at once. The steps lean first one way
and then the other as one goes round the tower. It is like climbing
the companion way, as I think one should call it—say the staircase,
in plain English—of a steamer in a storm. Begin to dislike the
sensation, when my guide suddenly stops. He suggests that the
tower is very high and fifty oentesimi very low. Tell him I don't
mind sirtv or seventy, and on we go, round and round. Begin to feel
almost giddy—imagine a circular staircase in a steamer in a storm!
—when he stops again. Notice in the dim light that he is broad-
shouldered and muscular, though short. Pleasant sort of place for a
fight with a reckless ruffian! Perhaps he has weapons! He says I
oueht to pay him a lira. Agree to this at once.
Up again, round and round. Think of all the mysterious murders
one reads of, and wish I had never come. Look up at him. He is
certainly bigger than I am. And what is that long straight thing
which makes his pocket stick out? Oh, horror! It must be a
knife, or a dagger in a sheath! Just then he stops, and says he would
like a cup of coffee when we get down again. How I wish we were
down again! Agree at once. Up a few more steps, and then he
stops again and says it is very hot, and he would like a bottle of
wine as well. Agree to this also at once. Up again, round and
round and round, and at last reach an outside gallery. Peep out
through the doorway. Refuse to trust mvself beyond. There is
only a single iron rail, and that not all round. Guide says I might
as well give him five lire, to include the wine and coffee. Agree to
this also, and feebly suggest that I have seen enough. But he is
inexorable, and on we go again.
At last at the top. Look over at happy, sleepy Pisa, and wish I
was down there. So I should be, pretty soon, if he threw me over!
Just then he says he would like a few cigars. Tell him I will
make it six lire, and that I should now like to go down. No! I
must see Livorno. Hang Livorno! But obey him meekly. Then he
says he has some antiquities for sale, among them some swords and
daggers. Ah! Just what I thought. Glance nervously at the
straight thing in his pocket, and say I will look at them. Then he
wants me to l<x>k over the iron railing at the sloping base below.
Hang over in the air? Never! But he will hold my legs. What?
Balance myself on a slender bar, while a brigand, as he probably is,
tilts me over by the boots? Would sooner buy all the antiquities in
Pisa. Good idea. Tell him I will buy bis swords if I can go at once
x> see them. Whereupon he hurries down so fast that I cannot.keep
jace with him. But I feel happier as I get
learer the outer world, and at last step out
safely on to the level earth. Look joyously
at the beautiful grass and the road to the
railwav station. Then perceive the custude
and a little man with him. Can that be my
guide? Why, I could knock him down
sasily! What a fool I was to be afraid of
dm! Still, that dagger—I must pay him
he six lire as I have promised them. He
reminds me that I also promised to buy his
swords. Feel inclined to dispute this, but
cannot. So settle it by giving him six lire
more. Then, before hurrying to the station,
isk him to show me the thing in his pocket. ", Si} signore," says
in a meek, deferential tone, and pulls it out. It is a flute.

inexorable, and on we go again.
At last at the top. Look over at happy, sleepy Pisa, and wish I
was down there. So I should be, pretty soon, if he threw me over!
Just then he says he would like a few cigars. Tell him I will
make it six lire, and that I should now like to go down. No! I
must see Livorno. Hang Livorno! But obey him meekly. Then he
oays he has some antiquities for pale, among them some swords and
daggers. Ah! Just what I thought. Glance nervously at the
straight thing in his pocket, and say I will look at them. Then he
^ants me to look over the iron railing at the sloping base below.
Hang over in the air? Never! But he will hold my legs. What?
Balance myself on a slender bar, while a brigand, as he probably is,
ilts me over by the boots? Would sooner buy all the antiquities in
Msa. Good idea. Tell him I will buy bis swords if I can goat onoe
o see them. Whereupon he hurries down so fast that I cannot, keep
>ace with him. But I feel happier as I get
nearer the outer world, and at last step out
safely on to the level earth. Look joyously
at the beautiful grass and the road to the
railway station. Then perceive the custode
md a little man with him. Can that be my
fuide? Why, I could knock him down
sasily! What a fool I was to be afraid of
urn! Still, that dagger—I must pay him
he six lire as I have promised them. He
eminds me that I also promised to buy his
words. Feel inclined to dispute this, but
sannot. So settle it by giving him six lire
more. Then, before hurrying to the station,
isk him to show me the thing in his pocket. ". «SV, signore" says
he, in a meek, deferential tone, and pulls it out. It is a flute.

MORE SHE-NOTES.
(By IOPNA, Author of " A Yellow Plaster,")
CHAPTER III.
COLOUR-BLIND from his tenth year, CHAMOIS HYDE (late of Christ's.
Oxford, not to be confused with Christchurch, Cambridge), had
hitherto ignored details of i-cenery; but now the vermiliony petal
of the pimpernel, the rubicund radix of the carrot, the blue of the
insensate bottle-fly—these reminded him respectively of the cheeks
of M MmKHIsr, her hair, the spots in her grey eyes where, as we
said, the soul looked through. The harvest-
sheaves again were, broadly speaking, her
figure.
Till now he had been impervious to the
new femalehood, rising like Proteus from
the azure foam; dumbly he had waited for a
woman with possible potentialities, or, fail-
ing this, with potential possibilities.
MAROERINE, whom we left a fortnight ago
inarticulately gurgling by the trout-stream,
caught the note of a step in the briar-patch.
With her budding instinct she could tell her
lover's footfall half a mile away, waking the
age-echo in her chest. This one was lighter
and less gregarious. In her sphinxy way
she divined that it belonged to a woman
with Puritan impossibilities and a yellow
plaster next her heart.
Under a inn-k of habitual and hereditary
reticence, the step came on, revealing a
finished creature, gowned beyond all mend-
ing. MARGERINK, whose face was her ewe-
lamb, became sub-acutely aware of her own
half-made frock, and yearned a little in the
other's direction.
"Oh!" she said; "how did you get it built that way? I mean
the gown." The woman's voice came through the envelope of
MABGERINE'S sub-consciousness, steely clear as a cheese-cutter.
"My name is Mrs. CHAMOIS HYDE. In other words, I am the wife
of Mr. CHAMOIS HYDE!"
"The wife of CHAMOIS HYDE?" said the innocent girl; "I do
not follow you."
"Let me explain," said the other, unsparingly. "CHAMOIS HYDE,
who is now due at your trout-stream (MAKGARINE smiled
stoopingly), "is my husband. I say, he married me. Once I had
a maiden name. That is all past. I changed it when I married.
All honourable women do. / am honourable. I changed mine.
Now I am Mrs. CHAMOIS HYDE. Sen?"
"Can't help that," said MABGKRINE cheerfully; "he loves me."
This was the folded-lamb's point of view.
"Girl, have you no bkame?'' This was the other woman's.
"Rather I blush for you," paid the unfinished creature. "You
couldn't make him love you, you couldn't; you're the bantering
feminine counterpart of the man in the other book, the Yelloic
Platter book. Now it is too late. We love each other. The matter
is taken out of our hands. We are merely impassive, irresponsible,
agents. Do try and look at the cose as I do, from an unbiased, im-
personal, point of view; and see that the fault is utterly your own."
The girl's regard for her lover had suffered no transitional throw-
ing-back at the news of his deception. She was overwhelming with
her palpabilites. Ah! it is the«e that men love-palpabilities.
"And have I none?" moaned the unhappy wife. ''If I could
blush, could only blush! He would have loved me then. But stay,
he is colour-blind; I forgot."
"Isaid just now I would blush
fur you," replied the other, who
had been under the eaves over-
hearing her thoughts. "And to
think of the chances you have
missed, and with a gown like
that! Why, if you are his
wife, you must often have met
him about, and not had to make
arrangements at a trout-stream
like me. Conceivably he has
even kissed you. I read once of
a married man who kissed his
wife." She suddenly stopped;
Worth re-tailing. not thftt one Of her intoxicating
gutturals had come loose • but an odd flood of pathos was playing on the
other's brow as she caught sight of CHAMOIS whistling aloofly behind
a sycamore, and went in thought all over that first kiss, complicated,
perhaps, perhaps rather billiardy, but still a thing to remember.
Like a cloud the ntigma lifted, and MABGERINE guessed her horrid

ful of me I But if you love him and I love him, why, we both, love
him! This is too much!" For a moment both of them pulsated
even as one tuning-fork. Though sundered by the estranging ocean
of the past that had closed its lid between th'em, leaving them like
shuttlecocks, sick with strong doses of womanhood and experience,
now that CHAMOIS, steadied by his breeding, was rapidly joining
the party, the two women leaned against one another (how seldom
women do this!), and waited, containedly restless. But the man, as
I said before, comes into the next chapter, if we ever get as far.
TRUE GLORY.
[" For assisting in destroying a legend, the Bev. Dr. NICHOLSON, who
pulverised IGNATIUS DONNELLY'S celebrated cryptogram, is to be presented
with an illuminated address.'1—Daily Telegraph, Nov. 28.]
I'VE always been courageous, in a
modest sort of way,
And sought an opportunity my
valour to display,
There's nothing I'd like better
than to lead a conquering host,
If STEVENSON or CONAN DOTLE
would offer me a post.
But, in real life, such chances are
extremely hard to find.
They disregard the model, too,
you 've carefully designed,
For it a foe—a burglar, say—you
venture to attack,
The disagreeable scoundrel's rather
apt to hit you back.
But here's a way—it's safer far,
as you will soon confess,—
To have your courage recognised
and praised in an Address;
It's a sort of learned skittles, and the method of it's plain—
You gravely set a dummy up, and knock it down again.
Just get a friend to postulate that TENNYSON 's a sham,
That MARTIN TUPPEH wrote the whole of In Memoriam,
Or else, that EGBERT BROWNING'S greatest work was Nancy Lee,

NEW HONOURS.
LAST week Solicitor-General FRANK LOCKWOOD, Q.C., M.P., was
knighted. So was the High Sheriff of Surrey, Mr. FRED WIGAN.
Quite appropriate that Queen's Counsel LOCKWOOD should appear
with Wig-an"—the gown too, of cjurse. After this J. WEEKS
SZLUMPKR was made a knight, and has now another " s " added to his
name. All hail, Sir BZLUMPEB, or "Zir /LVMI-EK!" As the ex-
mayor of Richmond quitted (backwards) the Royal Presence, did a
concealed choir sing a verse of the ancient ballad commencing
"Slumber my darling," and for this occasion altered to
my darling!"
LATEST WAR INTELLIGENCE.
IN the House of Commons, and elsewhere, the SECRETABY OP STATB
FOR WAR is accustomed to have appeals mode to him
to assist in providing facilities for the engagement
and remunerative occupation of soldiers and non-
commissioned officers no longer on active service.
We are glad to notice, from the subjoined advertise-
ment, which appeared in the Daily Newt of Thurs-
day, that the public are themselves taking the matter
in hand:—
TWO GENERALS WANTED, as Cook and Housemaid,
for inn- lady. Light, comfortable situation. Good
wages.—Apply, &c.
The advertiser, it will be observed, flies at higher
rank than that usually considered in this connection.
But the situation is " light "and " comfortable," with
"good wages" pertaining, and she has some right to
look for applicants of superior station. We presume
that on festive occasions the gallant officers would'be expected to
don their uniforms. Few things would be more striking than to see
a general probably wearing his war medals, sweeping the front door-
step, whilst through the kitchen window a glimpse was caught of a

secret. "You love him too? I never thought of that. How forget-
brother officer, in full tog, larding a pheasant.

A THEE WITH VARIEGATED LEAVES.
THE following communications have found their way into the
Editor's box at 85, Fleet Street, and are published that their writers
may claim them. As most of the signatures were more or less
illegible, it has been considered advisable to suppress them, to
prevent the possibility of mistakes. The only exception that has
been made to this rule is in the case of the last letter, wherein
seemingly is summed up the moral of the controversy.
Communication jVo. 1, dated Tuesday.
Is it not time, considering that there is nothing of particular
interest attracting public attention, that a protest should oe raised
against the " Society " plays which occupy the stages of some of our
best theatres? You see I pave the way to my gentle reproof by but-
tering up vested interests. To do this the better, I will say something
nice about "our most capable actors," and write "I remember
BUCKSTONE, and SOTHERN, the BANCROFTS, and, aye, Mr. TREE
himself." This will prove that there is no malice in my suggestions.
Let me describe the piece to which, in the dead season of the year,
[ object. The plot is centred in the love for each other of a par-
ti illy-1. claim ul lady and an opium-drinking gentleman; I might
use stronger expressions, but I know your paper is intended for the
family rather than the dress-circle, and my language is therefore
modulated to meet the modest requirements of the cose. Take it
from me. Sir, that the story of these two individuals is nauseous and
degrading. I say that its unravelling should not be foisted on the
public in a modern play. But that you may not consider my impres-
sions libellous, I add that the piece is finely staged, and in parts
well written. For all that, I canuot imagine why the manager, with
his lofty ideas of the function of a theatre as a medium of education,
has permitted himself to produce it. And if that observation does
not draw the manager in question, my name is not X. Y. Z.
Communication JVb. 2, dated Wednesday.
Your anonymous contributor "of London" (mark the sarcasm!)
was right in imagining that I would be drawn. I consider i
duty to Mr. HENRY ARTHUR JONES to say something about his
"accustomed combative geniality," and to Mr. HADDON CHAMBERS to
refer to his " cheery stoicism." I wiU also allude to Mr. PINERO, but
as he is not writing for my theatre just now, merely record my con-
viction that he wiU be able to survive the sneers against The Second
Mrs. Tanqueray—" a play which has made a deep and lasting im-
pression on the thinking public." And when I write "lasting,"
I am the more obliging, as I assume the rule of a prophet. It will be
"lasting," I am sure. The "thinking public," of course, are those
admirable and intellectual persons who fill the stalls and boxes of my
theatre, and the stalls and boxes of kindred establishments.
And, while I am talking of "thinking," let me insist that the
criticism of the piece by the anonymous one " of London" (mark the
irony !) is not a personal matter, but a question that affects the
freedom of the thinking community. This is a generation that has
outgrown " the skirts of the young lady of fifteen" ; and it behoves
all to understand the meaning of that apt sentence, and to regard
with a jealous eye any attempt to crib, cabin, and confine the
development of contemporary thought. "Crib, cabin, and confine"
is also good, and entirely worthy of your serious consideration. At
a time when the stalls ore 10«. 6rf.. and the family-circle available
to those who will not run to gold, is a literary dandy (in whose
stained forefinger I seem to detect the sign of an old journalistic
hand) to pass a vote of censure on SHAKSFEARE because, forsooth,
Hamlet was not forgotten P I trust not. And shall the public
(mark you the intellectual, the praiseworthy—in a word, the
"thinking public") be debarred from taking their piece in their
favourite theatre because, forsooth, there is an interesting corre-
spondence in newspapers in the dullest season of the decrepit old
year'( Again—1 trust not.
Communication No. 3—once more dated Wednesday.
I beg to ask your permission, as an old _playgoer, to see myself in
print. I do not pretend to be able to write myself, but an eminent
litterateur, in a recent number of a popular monthly magazine, has
done good service by enforcing the untruthful character of the
"problem" pieces recently presented to the public audiences. I have
not the ability to comment on this unpleasant phase of the histrionic
profession, so merely observe (with a recollection of an old-world
story) "them's my sentiments."
Communication No. 4, dated Thursday.
No doubt this letter will reach you with many others, with signa-
tures anonymous and otherwise. Being a bit spiteful I will confine
myself to rive lines in the hope of gaining insertion. Are not pieces
with " girls with a past" played out't Then why slay the slain 1* 1
am sure healthier work will now be submitted to the public. And
when that happy time arrives there will be found on my bookshelves
certain brown-paper-coyered tomes that are waiting the inspection
of every actor-manager in London. Need I say more Y You yourself,
Sir, wifl practically answer the question.
Communication No. 5, dated Friday.
Permit me to keep the ball a rolling. Why is the " young lady
of fifteen" to be alone protected? Are not tbe boys and girls of
an older growth to be also preserved from contamination? What is
to be done for that large class of playgoers who have entered their
second childhood?
Communication No. 6, dated Saturday.
Now that a piece at present being played at a West-End theatre
has been well advertised for a whole week in the more largely-
read columns of a most influential daily paper, it is to be sincerely
hoped that Box and Cox are satisfied. (Signed) BOUNCER.
WITH KIND REGARDS.
"WITH kind regards "—'tis good to see your writing
Even on meagre cjrrespondence-cards,
But would more matter you had been inditing
With kind regards!
Below you add that you are "mine sincerely,"
I wonder if in those two words you wrote
A sweet confession that you care—or merely
The usual ending to a friendly note P

The shooting lunches and round games of cards.
Our walks and talks that wonderful September—
I wonder what you meant by " kind regards"!

I read your note, most blessed among cards,
And think of you—I dare not say how often—

"how did you get it built that way Y I mean
woman's voice came through the envelope of
MORE SHE-NOTES.
(By IOPNA, Author of " A Yellow Plaster.")
CHAPTER III.
COLOUR-BLIND from his tenth year, CHAMOIS HYDE (late of Christ's.
Oxford, not to be confused with Christchurch, Cambridge), had
hitherto ignored details of t-cenery; but now the venniliony petal
of the pimpernel, the rubicund radix of the carrot, the blue of the
insensate bottle-fly—these reminded him respectively of the cheeks
of MABGKKINE, her hair, the spots in her grey eyes where, as we
said, the soul looked through. The harvest-
sheaves again were, broadly speaking, her
figure.
Till now he had been impervious to the
new femaJehood, rising like Proteus from
the azure foam; dumbly he had waited for a
woman with possible potentialities, or, fail-
ing this, with potential possibilities.
MARGERINE, whom we left a fortnight ago
inarticulately gurgling \>y the trout-stream,
caught the note of a step in the briar-patch.
With her budding instinct she could tell her
lover's footfall half a mile away, waking the
age-echo in her chest. This one was lighter
and less gregarious. In her sphinxy way
she divined that it belonged to a woman
with Puritan impossibilities and a yellow
plaster next her heart.
Under a mask of habitual and hereditary
reticence, the step came on, revealing a
finished creature, gowned beyond all mend-
ing. MARGERINE, whose face was her ewe-
lamb, became sub-acutely aware of her own
half-made frock, and yearned a little in the
other's direction.
"Oh!" she said;
the gown." The woman's
MABOERINE'S sub-consciousness, steely clear as a cheese-cutter.
"My name is Mrs. CHAMOIS HIDE. In other words, I am the wife
of Mr. CHAMOIS HYDE!"
"The wife of CHAMOIS HYDE?" said the innocent girl; "I do
not follow you."
"Let me explain," said the other, unsparingly. "CHAMOIS HYDE.
who is now due at your trout-stream (MAHGAUINE smiled
stoopingly), "is my husband. I say, he married me. Once I had
a maiden name. That is all past. I changed it when I married.
All honourable women do. / am honourable. I changed mine.
Now I am Mrs. CHAMOIS HYDE. 8eo?"
"Can't help that," said MARGERINE cheerfully; "he loves me."
This was the folded-lamb's point of view.
"Girl, have you no shame?'' This was the other woman's.
"Rather I blush for you," said the unfinished creature. "You
couldn't make him love yon, you couldn't; you 're the hankering
feminine counterpart of the man in the other book, the Yellow
Platter book. Now it is too late. We love each other. The matter
is taken out of our hands. We are merely impassive, irresponsible,
agents. Do try and look at the case as I do, from an unbiassed, im-
personal, point of view; and see that the fault is utterly your own."
The girl's regard for her lover had suffered no transitional throw-
ing-back at the news of his deception. She was overwhelming with
her palpabilites. Ah! it is the»e that men love-palpabilities.
"And nave I none?" moaned the unhappy wife. ''It I could
blush, could only blush! He would have loved me then. But stay,
he is colour-blind; I forgot."
"I said j u»t now I would blush
'or you," replied the other, who
md been under the eaves over-
hearing her thoughts. "And to
think of the chances you have
missed, and with a gown like
that! Why, if you are his
wife, you must often have met
him about, and not had to make
arrangements at a trout-stream
like me. Conceivably he has
even kissed you. I read once of
a married man who kissed his
wife." She suddenly stopped;
Worth re-tailing. not tnftt one of jjer intoxicating
gutturals had come loose; but an odd flood of pathos was playing on the
other's brow as she caught sight of CHAMOIS whistling aloofly behind
a sycamore, and went in thought all over that first kiss, complicated,
perhaps, perhaps rather billiardy, but still a thing to remember.
Like a cloud the stigma lifted, and MARGERINE guessed her horrid


ful of me I But if you love him and / love him, why. we both love
him! This is too much!" For a moment both of them pulsated
even as one tuning-fork. Though sundered by the estranging ocean
of the past that had closed its lid between them, leaving them like
shuttlecocks, sick with strong doses of womanhood and experience,
now that CHAMOIS, steadied by his breeding, was rapidly joining
the party, the two women leaned against one another (how seldom
women do this!), and waited, containedly restless. But the man, as
I said before, comes into the next chapter, if we ever get as far.
TRUE GLORY.
[" For assisting in destroying a legend, the Rev. Dr. NICHOLSON, who
pulverised IGNATIUS DONNELLY'S celebrated cryptogram, is to be presented
with an illuminated address."—Daily Telegraph, Nov. 28.]
I'v K always been courageous, in a
modest sort of way,
And sought an opportunity my
valour to display,
There's nothing I'd like better
than to lead a conquering host,
If STEVENSON or CONAN BOYLE
would offer me a post.
But, in real life, such chances are
extremely hard to find.
They disregard the model, too,
you 've carefully designed,
For it a foe—a burglar, say—you
venture to attack,
The disagreeable scoundrel' a rather
apt to hit you back.
But here's a way—it's safer far,
as you will soon confess,—
To have your courage recognised
and praised in an Address;
It's a sort of learned skittles, and the method of it's plain—
You gravely set a dummy up, and knock it down again.
Just get a friend to postulate that TENNYSON 's a sham,
That MARTIN TCPPER wrote the whole of In Memoriam,
Or else, that ROBERT BROWNING'S greatest work was Nancy Lee,
And then—you prove your friend is wrong—and there you ar«, you see.
They '11 give you testimonials, many speakers will allude
In tones of deep emotion to " a nation's gratitude ";
So if you sigh for glory, I can recommend the game,
For literary ninepins is a speedy path to fame!

THE END.
EGBERT ON HUNIFIKASHUN!
I HAVE bin a having quite a long tork with a most respecful look-
ing Gent who tells me he is a reel County Counseller, and that they
has a Gildhall of their own at Charing Cross, where they meets ewery
week, the same as the Common Connsellers does at their reel GildhaU
in the Citty, and that they hax quite made up
^..7\ their minds to make the two Gildhalls into one
and have them both for theirselves, and that
that will be what they calls Hunifikashun,
which means everything for them and not
nothink for nobody else.
Not content with what they have got allreddy
they means to have all the Citty Perlice, and
the Manshun House, and all the Citty's Money,
and the rite to all the Terns Water, and to the
Loan MARK and Sherryfs Carridges, and to the
Old Bayley, and to more other things than I can
manage to remember! And he really speaks of
all these warious matters jest as if he was quite
in ernest, and acshally expected as it woud all
be done by the next Parlement when they met
next year! And when he found as I reelly
didn't beleeve a word of his wunderful stories,
he acshally arsked me to go with him to their
Gildhall at Charing Cross, and there he put me
. in a nice seat, and then I heard em all forking
away, jest as if they were quite in ernest, all about the many
wunderful things as they was about to do soon! Oh, I wunders how
long it will be before any on em reelly happens? Not in my life
time I'll be bound, nor most likelv in nobody elses! Did any
reesonable man, woman 01 child ever hear such a pack of nonsense?
To aoshally defraud the grand old Citty of Lundpn, that is only jest
about seven hunderd year old, of all their priwileges and all their
rites and all their money! and then I shoud like to know what is to
become of me, and the duzzens like me? Nice lots of Lord Mare«
and Alldermen these County Counsellers wond make! Why I
acshally clouts whether they ooud even manage to make up a decent
lot of Common Counselmen under at least a year.
There was one thing ss I heard them pqnabling about while!'wag
there, and that was the nessessity of having some more lunatic
asylums, which did not much surprise me, as I shoud think they
will soon want a pretty good number for theirselves, if they con-
tinues to go on as they are going.
BROWN told me a rayther funny story about the dredful solemnity
of these wunderful County Counsellers. He says thev have by sum
means or other got the right of insist in that there shall be no Ian in
the theaters, and no warking about between the bacts; and that the
publick got so di'gusted with the silly regerlations, that in many
cases they left off going to them for ewer so long; but they are
better now, and will most likely soon go back to their old armless
jokes. ROBERT.

"AN OLD OFFENDER."
[" It is'impossible, we fear, to escape from the
conclusion that there is a substantial basis of fact
for the rumours ... of atrocities perpetrated by
Turkish troops on the Christian inhabitants of
Armenia. ... By one of the Articles of the
Treaty of Berlin the Porte undertook ' to carry out
without delay the improvement* and reforms de-
manded by local requirements in the province*
inhabited by the Armenians, and to guarantee
their security against the Circassians and the
Kurds.'"—" Tima" Lttuitr, December 4.]
AGAIN! Is there nothing can humanise ever
The heart of Islam, that red-ravening wolf P
Will bonds of 'convention and treaty bridge
never
Between Turk and Christian the broadening
gulf?
Will no lesson teaoh, and will no promise
tether,
The Ottoman hordes when let loose on the
foe?
Must slaughter, and rapine, and outrage
together,
The old vile triumvirate, fetterless go P,
Time's fool seems the Turk, stern, unteach-
able, savage,
The fiercest fool-fighter on history's roll.
All indolent rest or undisciplined ravage.
The varnish of manner soaks not to his
soul.
Red Man of the Orient, ruthless, untamable,
Neighbour, by fortune, in nothing near kin.
Humanity's brotherhood surely is blameable,
Leaving him free from Law's bondage
to win!
In sheer self-defence we must] muzzle and
shackle
This wolf of the world; snatch its poor
From its crimsoning fangs. The old cynical
cackle
Of " coffee-house babble " is silent to-day;
And a weapon's at hand, too long left there
unlifted,
That Law and that Justice alike now com-
mend
To the grip of Europa. Be murder short-
shrifted
And bestial outrage meet summary end!
Not again must hot Islamite hate be permitted
In chase of creed-vengeance the East to
embroil;
Not'again must its prey fall unaided, nnpitied,
The Gallio's mock, and the miscreant's
spoil.
There hangs the good Berlin-blade, consecrated
By common agreement to Justice's work!
Be its blow not this time, as aforetime, be-
lated!
Let Europe not bleed for the sin of the Turk!

Kelt and Salted.—It may be true, as you have
heard, that Mr. STANDISH O'GaADr intends to
supplement his series of Ossianic stories, Finn
and his Companions, by a work entitled Fin an'
Haddock. But, we confess, the story seems a
little fishy.
A Brummagem Spoon.—You are quite wrong.
The creation of the character of Rip Van Winkle
was, in point of time, far anterior to the inven-
tion of the Self-working Noiseless Screw. Mr.
CHAMBERLAIN'S playful application of the term
to Lord HARTrNGTON did not imply any pro-
prietorship in the article. The right hon. gen-
tleman was under the impression that he had
come across the character in the course of his
reading of DICKENS' Christmas stories, and,
wanting to say something nice of his noble
friend, he just mentioned it. It led to some
misunderstanding at the time, but has now been
forgotten. See our answer to " Three Cows and
I Residuary Legatee. — Certainly you may

Perplexed.—What do you mean by asking us
to tell you " If a herrinsr and a-half costs three
hapence. how much will a dozen run you in

j you can solve for yourself on reference to an
ordinary book of arithmetic. Do you suppose

Beyond the Dreams of Avarice.—
Your record of an incident in the early
life of Mr. W. ASTOR is very interesting.
"Musing by the waters of the mighty
Hudson he," you say, "conceived the
ambition of becoming one of the richest
men in the world." It is pleasing to
know that his recent entrance upon jour-
nalistic enterprise is likely to realise his
boyhood's dream.
Advertisement Agent.—There is, we
fear, no opening for you in this direc-
tion. "Sflonio is not the name of a
new shaving soap, as you surmise. It
is the title of honour given by the dele-
gates of a remote but respectable African
race to a great and good British states-
man. Its literal translation into the

"Open-mouthed."

FIRST IMPRESSIONS.
"THEBE is nothing in Italy more beautif i
to me than the coast-road between Genoa an
Spezia." Remember these words of DICKEN
in his Pictures from Italy, as I start from
Pisa to gee that lovely coast, and the Mediter
ranean, for the first time.
Pisa is sleepy, but the railway officials ar
wide awake. The man who sells me m
ticket "forgets" one lira. This answer
capitally with innocent old ladies from Eng
land or Germany. The old lady counts he
change, and if she has carefully ascertains
the fare by reading the price marked on he
ticket, she finds at once that there is a half
penny wanting. She never learns that thi
is the Government tax. "If you please," sh
begins; or, "Hitte," and then she goes of
into—not hysterics, but French, and mur
murs, "Seevooplay, je pongee vous devay
avoir aonnay moi un sou—er—er—more, vow
comprennyt" or, "// y a encore—er—er—
funfzig, vous savoy, d moi a payer." Then
the official answers, also in French, "A
nong, Madame, ceci est la tare doo gouverne
ma"ff sul biglietto, capitce 1"
Whereupon the old lady is so agitated b
the thought that she has wrongfully accused
him of stealing a soldo, that she never notice
that he has withheld a lira. If she counts
her money later in the day, she will blame
those nasty lira notes, which stick together
so, that she must have given two somewhere
instead of one. But the railway clerk is also
prepared for any more exacting stranger, anc
holds the extra note ready for him. The
clerk at Pisa does so, handing it to me, with-
out a word of objection or explanation, as
soon as I ask for it. The system is as perfecl
as it is simple. Having obtained my change,
I start for the Mediterranean.
A FIBST IMPRESSIONIST.
THE TRUISMS OF LIFE.
(By the Right Hon. the Author of " The Platitudes
of Life," M.P., F.R.S., D.G.L., LL.D.)
CHAPTER I.—De Omnibus Rebus.
"Ass longa, vita brevis ;"' and indeed
"man wants but little here below, nor wants
that little long." * An oriental writer has
told us that "all flesh is grass," to which a
Scots poet3 has replied, that "A man's a
man for a' that." There is a Greek aphorism,
not sufficiently well known, which says yvu9t
afavriv. This has been ably rendered by POPE
in the words "Know thyself."4 Proverbi-
ally " piety begins at home," but it is wrong
to deduce from this that education ends when
we leave school; "it goes on through life."'
Books are an educational force. They
"have often been compared to friends,"'
whom we " never cut."' They "are better
than all the tarts and toys in the world."8
It is not generally known that "English
literature is the inheritance of the English
race," • on whose Empire, by the way, "the
sun never sets." We even have "books in
the running brooks," as the Bard of Avon10
tells us; so that not only "he that runs,"
but he that swims, "may read."
"Knowledge for the million,"" is the
"fin de siecle " u cry of the hour. But "life
is real, life is earnest,"" and we have no
time to study original thinkers such as CON-
FUCIUS and TOTPEB. "Altiora Peto " » is a
saying for the leisured class only. The mass
must get its wisdom second-hand and concen-
trated. If "reading maketh a full man,""
this kind of reading maketh a man to burst.
Hence the "sad in sweet"" of the book of i
quoted platitudes. Yet, of course, "there i
are great ways of borrowing. Genius borrows |

A PRECISIAN.

obly." >7 And it is well to have "the
ourage of " other people's "opinions."
But reading is not all. You must "use
our head."' And you must, and can,
eep it too. For a good man's head is not
ke a seed-cake that passes in the using.
nd, again, remember the proverb that "man-
ers makyth man"; though this is not the
me cause of the over-population of our
lands. In social life much will depend on
le way in which you behave to others.
Never lose your temper, and if you do, at
ny rate hold your tongue, and try not to show
""—except, one may add, to a doctor.
Many people cannot say "No!" Others
rly learn to say "No!" when asked to do
sagreeable things. "Mens sana in cor pore
sano." _ If the last word is pronounced Say
No, this constitutes a word-play. There are
some bad word-plays in SHAKSPEABE. I dis-
approve of humour, new or old.

little fishy.
A Brummagem Spoon.—You are quite wrong.
The creation of the character of Jlip Van Winkle
was, in point of time, far anterior to the inven-
tion of the Self-working Noiseless Screw. Mr.
CHAMBEBLAIN'S playful application of the term
to Lord HAKTTNGTON did not imply any pro-
prietorship in the article. The right hon. gen-
tleman was under the impression that he had
come across the character in the course of his
reading of DICKENS' Christmas stories, and,
wanting to say something nice of his noble
friend, he just mentioned it. It led to some
misunderstanding at the time, hut has now heen
forgotten. See our answer to " Three Cows and

know that his recent entrance upon jour-

is the title of honour given by the dele-

FIRST IMPRESSIONS.
"THEBE is nothing in Italy more beautiful
to me than the coast-road between Genoa and
Spezia." Remember these words of DICKENS,
in his Pictures from Italy, as I start from
Pisa to see that lovely coast, and the Mediter-
ranean, for the first time.
Pisa is sleepy, but the railway officials are
wide awake. The man who sells me my
ticket "forgets" one lira. This answers
capitally wilh innocent old ladies from Eng-
land or Germany. The old lady counts her
change, and if she has carefully ascertained
the fare by reading the price marked on her
ticket, she finds at once that there is a half-
penny wanting. She never learns that this
is the Government tax. "If you please," she
begins; or, "Sitte," and then she goes off
into—not hysterics, but French, and mur-
murs, "Seevooplay, je pongee rous devays
avoir donnay nioi un sou—er—er—more, vous
comprennyf" or, "// y a encore—er—er—
funfzig, vous savay, a moi a payer." Then
the official answers, also in French, "Ah
nong, Madame, ceci est la tare doo gouveme-
mang sul biglietto, capisce?"
Whereupon the old lady is so agitated by
the thought that she has wrongfully accused
him of stealing a soldo, that she never notices
that he has withheld a lira. If she counts
her money later in the day, she will blame
those nasty lira notes, which stick together
so, that she must have given two somewhere
instead of one. But the railway clerk is also
prepared for any more exacting stranger, and
holds the extra note ready lor him. The
clerk at Pisa does so, handing it to me, with-
out a word of objection or explanation, as
soon as I ask for it. The system is as perfect
as it is simple. Having obtained my change,
I start for the Mediterranean.
A FIBST IMPRESSIONIST.
THE TRUISMS OF LIFE.
(By the Right Hon. the Author of " The Platitudes
of Life," M.P., F.S.S., D.C.L., LL.D.)
CHAPTER l.—De Omnibus Rebus,
"Ana longa, vita brevis ;" * and indeed
"man wants but little here below, nor wants
that little long." 8 An oriental writer has
told us that "all flesh is grass," to which a
Scots poet3 has replied, that "A man's a
man for a] that." There is a Greek aphorism,
not sufficiently well known, which says fvuSi
naurtr. This has been ably rendered by POPE
in the words "Know thyself."4 Proverbi-
ally " piety begins at home," but it is wrong
to deduce from this that education ends when
we leave school; "it goes on through life."*
Books are an educational force. They
"have often been compared to friends,"6
whom we " never cut."' They "are better
than all the tarts and toys in the world."•
It is not generally known that "English
literature is the inheritance of the English
race,"9 on whose Empire, by the way, "the
sun never sets." We even have "books in
the running brooks," as the Bard of Avon10
tells us: so that not only "he that runs,"
but he that swims, "may read."
"Knowledge for the million,"11 is the
'ftn de siecle " a cry of the hour. But "life
is real, life is earnest," 13 and we have no
time to study original thinkers such as CON-
FUCIUS and TUPPEK. "Altiora Peto" " is a
saying for the leisured class only. The mass
must get its wisdom second-hand and concen-
trated. If "reading maketh a full man," 15
this kind of reading maketh a man to burst.
Hence the "sad in sweet" « of the book of
quoted platitudes. Yet, of course, "there i
are great ways of borrowing. Genius borrows

nobly."1? And it is well to have "the
courage of " other people's "opinions."
But reading is not all. You must "use
vour head."' And you must, and can,
keep it too. For a good man's head is not
like a seed-cake that passes in the using.
And, again, remember the proverb that'' man-
ners makyth man"; though this is not the
true cause of the over-population of our
islands. In social life much will depend on
the way in which you behave to others.
"Never lose your temper, and if you do, at

Many people cannot say "No!" Others

round Man."
THE CHRONICLES OF A RURAL PARISH.
VI.—PREPARING FOR THE POLL.
WHEN I do a thing, I like to do it properly, for even my
worst enemies, who call me a fool, admit thit I 'm a thorough fool.
I have acejrdingly lost no time in getting to work at my electoral
campaign. I commenced at a great disadvantage. The other seven
candidates were electioneering for a week before the Pari-h Meeting,
and the result was that they all
polled three times as many votes
as I did. That has happened
once. 1 don't intend that it shall
happen more than once.
The first move I made was to
cover my house with placards. 1
noticed that in a recent election
Mr. ATHKLSTON RILEY had pur-
sued theie tactics with great
success, so I plastered the whole
i of the walls with "WINKINS
IFOK MUDFOKD "—" VOTK FOR
WIXKINS,''—but thereby hangs
a tale. I gave my instructions to
the locil printer, and told him
where they were to be posted,
directing him to do it in the
twilight, so that the whole effect
might dawn once and for ever
upon an astonished village in the morning. He did it, but un-
fortunately he didn't keep a proof-reader. I noticed next day,
before I went out, that all the school-children looked up at the
house and giggled. I thought it was merely the inappreciativeness
of the youthful mind. There I was wrong. It was the fact that the
children knew how to ipell that caused the mischief. My house was
covered with appeal* to "WOTK FO« VINKINS!" It did not take
long to get new bills printed, but I am not disposed to deny I was a
trine disconcerted by this false start.
I am now hard at work canvassing. My wife flatly declines to
help, and I 'm afraid to suggest the girls should take the field in sup-
p >rt of their father. I tried to secure the services of the vicar's two
daughters, but he only wrote rather a stiff note to say that he thought
they would have quite enough to d'> in advocating his claims. I am
not always at one with the clergy, but for once I agree with him. I
hare succeeded, however, in getting Miss PHILL BCRTT to help me.
Her fall name is, of course, PHYLLIS; but it's always called and
spelt "PHILL"—I could never understand why. She's a most delight-
ful girl, and is worth, at least, a hundred votes to me. As I ex-
plained once before, she has an extraordinary habit of calling all the
villagers " idiots"—of course, I mean to her friends (such as myself),
not to the villagers themselves. I asked her one day why, if she
thought them idiots, she was kind enough to take the trouble to
canvass them. "Well, you see," she said with a charming smile that
was all her own; "I 'm asking them to vote for you." At the time
I thought this was a pretty saying, prettily said. I even told it with
some amount of pride to my wife just to show her that there were
people who did not sympathise with her haughty indifference.
Curiously enough my wife onlv laughed consumedly. When she had
recjvered, I asked her why she laughed. "Do you really mean to
say, TIMOTHY," was her reply, "that you don't see what she meantf"
"Well, though it may seem idiotic . . ." I said, and was going to
add, "I don't," but before 1 said that, I did see what she (PHYLLIS,
of course, 1 in. in .•/./.;/..' have meant. Yet I hope she didn't. Miss
BORTT has only one drawback as a canvasser. She is BO ridiculously
bcrupulous, I came across an old woman the other day who was quite
deaf to my appeals. WThilst I reasoned with her, 1 found out now
kind PHYLLIS was to her. "Miss PHILL, she's really good to us

Produced no impression. A day or two after I met Miss PHILL
URTT, and asked her to go and canvass the old woman; I felt sure
she ould secure her vote. Will it be believed that she wouldn't?
She said it would be really undue influence if she did. flow strange
that even the nicest of women are so strangely unpractical at times!
Another woman she refused to see because she never called upon her
at ordinary times. Still, with all her faults. Miss BCTETT is a tower
of strength, and as I see her daily going about, canvass book in
hand, my hopes rise higher and higher.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
SIR PHILIP SIDNEY was, as all the world knows, "a veray parfit
?entil knight." Possibility of this presupposition of knowledge is
fortunate, since Miss ANNA M. SFODDART'S account of this heroic
figure is not, my Baronite sorrowfully says, likely to convey any
adequate idea of its personality. Mr. Fox BOVBNE and Mr.
ADDINGTOX SYMONDS have written
biographies of the Elizabethan
soldier, in which he boldly stands
f .rth. Miss STODDART modestly
bays her object is "in no way to
compete with" these standard
works. But why write at all?
The marvel is, as Dr. JOHNSON
did not exactly say in illustration
»f an argument respecting another
feminine achievement, not that
the work should not have been
well done, but that it possibly
could be done with such wooden
effect. If Miss STODDART had
taken a sheet of paper and with
her pair of scissors cut out the
figure of a man, writing across it
"This ia PHILIP SIDNEY," she
would have conveyed quite as clear and moving a picture of the man
as is found iu the 111 pages of her bjok. But then Mr. BLACKWOOD
would not have published the scrap of paper, and we should not have
had the charming portrait of SIDNEY, or the sketches of Penahurst by
MARGARET L. HUGGIXS which adorn the daintily got-up volume.
My Baronitess writes:—S BARING GOULD turns into delightful
English prose someof theancient Icelandic Sagas, or songs, and shows
us how Grettir the Outlaw wasaGrettir man than was generally snp-
po»ed by anyone who had never heard very much about hi on. When

Sou1-wester and Sword, by HUGH ST. LEGEH. A nautical and
military combination. The Sou'wester of a tar is not at all at sea
when, after a pleasant little shipwreck, he joins the'forces at
Suakim. The winner of this Sr. LEOBK was a rank outsider, with
the odds against him, but he wins the day by "throstling" (anew
word) a few Soudanese; who must have seemed quite forty to one!
A cousin, especially a Colonial, is such a very pleasant indistinct
sort of relative, that he is brand to be a hero of romance, though
perhaps a cousin at hand is worth two in the bush; at least, so
thinks the heroine in My Cousin from Australia, by EVELYN
EVKRKTT GREEN (HUTCHINSON & Co.); whilst, the one whom she
should have wed was of course a wicked Baronet (does one often meet a
good Baronet in fiction 'r), who tries to upset his successful rival by
giving him a tip over an agreeably high cliff. It is a Christmas story,
and 8othe"tip" is just at the right time. Howitends You'llsee.
Black and White has gone in for a (hilling's worth of the truly
wonderful in The Dream Club, by BARRIE PAIN and EDKK
PHILPOTTS. It is quite an after-turkey, plum-pudding, mince-pie
dinner story, flow authors and artists must have suffered, judging,
at least, by the delightful nightmare illustrations. And the picture-
lady of the cover—ahem!-she has evidently forgotten that she is
supposed to be "out " at ChrUtmas.
Between the boards of LOTHAH MEGGENDORFKR'S moveable toy-
books (H. 0 REVEL & Co.) lies genuine fun. The Scenes of the Life of
a Mather are simply irrebistible. Litile ones will be delighted with
The Transformation Scenes, besides, there is Charming Variety with
a Party of Six. These books are a good tip for a Christinas gift for
the representatives of Tommy and Harry.
Had G. W. APPLBTON'B The Co-JfesponJeiit—an attractive title-
been in the form of a short magazine story, it would piobably have
been amusing from first to last. Now it is only auiu-ingat first.
Good idea all the same. The old quotation about "Sir HUBERT
STANLEY" is brought in, and, of course, incorrectly. It is not
"Praise from Sir HUBERT STANLEY," but "approbation." However,
as it is said by a light-hearted girl of a very modern tjpe, it may be
poor people. I 'd vote for her if she was standing." 1 left, having

Quention. You consider
yourself neglected because, I
presume, the public do not
appreciate you at your proper
value?
Answer. That if, indeed,
the case, and for further par-
ticulars I refer you to a recent
correspondence in the Pall
Mall Gazette.
Q. Is it not necessary thai
you should acquire an immenoe
amount of knowledge t o under-
take the duties of your pro-
fession worthily?
A. Certainly; and we wel-
come any kind of safeguard
that will protect the public
agains Iran.I and imposture.
Q. Then you consider your-
profef cion verv seriously?
A. Undoubtedly. It is the
most important profession in
the world; not a man, woman,
or child exists who has not
derived some benefit from its
exercise.
Q. If I am not mistaken,
you ought to be educated al
Oxford or Cambridge to do
fall justice to your opportu-
nities?
A. Certainly; upon the
foundation of a school train-
ing at either Eton, West-
minster, Rugby, or Harrow.
Q. Ought you not to take
up human and comparative
anatomy?
A. As a matter of course,
combined with phytiology and
chemistry.
Q. But does every professor
of your art follow this routine
of work?

A. Those who are of the
greater worth. There are out-
siders who assume our noble
name and yet know nothing of
our special bubject.
Q. Besides the studies you
have mentioned, are there any
others necessary to the forma-
tion of a man of your special
attainments?
A. Well, it would be well
for an operator to understand
metallurgy and mechanics.
Q. And have you to culti-
vate the graces of the person?
A. Certainly; you must be
of a pleasing and courteous
presence. You must be fitted
by nature and art to obtain
the confidence of those who
tay you a professional visit,
fou must be tender and true.
You must be able to converse
every subject under the
sun, and distract the attention
of a sufferer from his pains by
causing him to listen to your
anecdotes.
Q. It seems, then, you must
be an admirable Crichton?
A. Well,yes, in a small way.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS.
En Ktiute to the Mediterranean.—I am alone, until a Frenchman
and hi* young wife come in and glare at me, presumably because I
am already there. The ordinary honeymoon couple anywhere are
supercilious enough, and a French hone \moon couple perhaps more
so. If jou gazeabxently at the bvck of Madame's hut, when you are
looking at the mountains beyond Madame's head. Monsieur glares
at you with the concentrated fury of an angry menagerie. But a
French c uple, travelling in Italy, which loves the Triple Alliance,
develope sn air of supt-rciliuusne-s quite unapproach- d; and when
tin ir solitude is invadtd by an Englishman, a native of the country
which occupies Egypt, th<.usnnd thunders, it is too strong!
So these two whisper together, and look out of one window, while I
look out of the other, at Viaieggio, and the distant Carrara quarries
and other sight*. All interesting and beautiful, n<> doubt, but not to
be compared to what I i-hall see neyond Spezia Think of the blue
sea, the glorious hills, the olive wood*, the Italian fiAing villages,
the orange groves, the garden* and the flowers. Rather better than
that English coast which Londoners know so well, the seashore at
Brighton, probably the ugliest in the woild, with the most unpictur-
esqne town stretching along it. Of course, I ohall not see everything
from the train, but I shall at least have the recolUc'ion of an
earthly paradise, to torment me ever aftnr when travelling in the
infernal regions of the Underground Railwav. November in Genoa;
November in Oower Street! Halloo, thi< is Spi/ia'
Now then, look out. Oh, here'« a tunnel first. Wait patiently till
we are through the tunnel. By dim light of carriage lamp perceive
the French people glaring at me. This is a long tunnel. But then
at 1 he end I shall see Here is the end. Down with the window.
There's the Mediter Halloo! Another tunnel. Up with the
window. At last this one is coming to an end. Down with the win-
dow again. Look out. There's the Medi Halloo, another one!
Up with the window again. French people still glare, but, it seems
to me, more mildly. A fellow-feeling of suffocation, no doubt.
Well, this it long. At last we 're out. Down with the window once
more. There's the Med What? Another one. Up with the
window once more. This it a long one. Begin to cough. French-
man also coughs. A bond of sympathy. We cough together. Well,
at last we are out of th««e awful tunnels. Down with the window.
Thtre's the Medit Up with the window. Another one! These
gymnastics with the windows are most fatiguing. Choke again.
Frenchman also chokes. "Cet tunnels!" he gasps at last, "on

head, as before, goes out of his window, like mine out of my
window. There's the Me . Another! "Sapritti!" By Jove!
More choking. "Ces cheniint de fers italiens "begins the
Frenchman. Then another burst of daylight and his head and mine
go out. There's the Medit "Matin / ' Great Scott! Agree with

AN EXTRACT FROM A PRIVATE LETTER.
"AND OH, MABEL, A ffKSTca MISTOOK MY SKIRT FOR THE "Bus APRON, THE OTHER DAY, AND DIDN'T FIND OUT HIS MISTAKE
FOR EVKR SO LONG. OF COURSE HE WAS AWFULLY NICE ABOUT IT; SO I HAD TO SAY, IT DIDN'T MATTER. BUT WASN'T IT DREADFUL I"
THE INFANT PHENOMENON.
WHEN the song said Jap AH SID was just nothing but a kid
Of what ALCOCK dubbed '' a race grotesque and savage,"
The Wise West had not a notion of the kick-up and commotion,
The naval noise and military ravage.
That same " little kid" would raise; of the pteans of loud praise
The Wise Boy of the East would hear around him.
A pupil of the West he was held, but, upon test,
A teacher, in his way, the West has found him.
Phenomenal young Jappy, Occidental Powers seem happy
To gather round and watch the object lesson
In the wicked Art of War, seeing proof you 've carried far
In matters which before we might but guess on.
If a kid, he's not a fool! With his ferula and stool,
His blackboard and his lump of chalk, he 's showing
How to work an ironclad! It's amazing that a lad
With a lemon-face should be so wondrous knowing!
He '11 teach you to work as he does in the matter of torpedoes,
And how to blow a rival fleet to blazes.
In naval matters practical, strategical and tactical,
The nipper shows a nous that almost dazes.
Though his names and terms sound funny, it is more than even
money,
That he hides a lot of wisdom in his lingo.
And what matter baggy breeches, and a speech all "his" and
"ichis,"
If this "Boy" can give the Chinese Giant stingo?
His phiz looks flat and pasty, and his head-gear's hardly tasty,
And his eyes are like black-beetles set a-swivel.
But though plain or currant-bunny, and the colour of fresh honey,
He's as full as HADESU of dash and "divil."
See, those eyes are all a-twinkle! Like the sudu-mushi's tinkle
Fall his accents very suave, but full of gumption:
And you '11 hardly now tind any to retort. "Oh, teach your granny!"
Or to twit the " little kid" with youth s presumption.
For the stalwart Teuton listens, and the Great Bear's optic glistens,
And the " Melicau" " lays low and don't say nuffin ,
Save to whisper to JOHN BULL, "He 'B no mug, by a jug-/wW,
Infant phenomenon? Wai, I rayther guess he's gone
And chalked it out a caution. He's a spry "un!"
And JOHN BULL, who'll have to strain to keep monarch of the main,
ThinkB the infant Jap a chap to keep hi* eye on!

Violet. So he has! Then why not this exquisite silver cigar-ash
tray?
Daisy. Yes, that would be just the thing; only, unfortunately,
JACK never smokes, and always walks out of the room if anybody
else does.
Violet. Oh! That's awkward. This drinking-horn—what do
you think of it f
Daisy (gloomily'). I 'm afraid JACK 'B a Blue Ribbpnite.
Violet (after a pause). He needn't use it for drinking from. It
would do for a flower-vase, if it had a stand. Anyhow, let's make
haste and choose something.
Daisy. I would give him this lovely ink-bottle, only he uses a
type-writer. Ah, I have it—a purse I
Violet. The question is whether JACK has it, not you.
Daisy (enthusiastically). Yes, a purse it shall be. JACK never has
any money—but that is only a detail. Showy, isn't it?
Violet. Awfully pretty! Made in Germany, too, it says; that
makes it so much more romantic.
Daisy (groaning). Come awav! JACK'S a morbid patriot. Won't
look at a thing not made in England. I must choose some other
day. And we shall be horribly late for lunch. Really, present-
choosing isn't as easy as one thinks I

stared at the Savoy, and is brought out under the direction of Mr.
D'OYLY CABTK. The brilliant audience that gathered on Wednesday
night for the first performance of The Chieftain evidently came full
of expectation, and as evidently went away filled with satisfaction.
Twenty-seven years ago. when they were boys together, B. and 8. (that
sounds friendly and refreshing) brought out an early version of the
opera which they called The
Oontrabandiita. After the re-
hearsal of the new piece had
gone forward for some weeks,
ARTHUR SULLIVAN stumbled
over this rather difficult word
and spraintdhisankle. Where-
upon F. C. B., with charac-
teristic promptitude and origi-
nality, changed the name to
The Chieftain. That is the
c ill-boy's narrative of events.
However it be, since the opera
has been entirely re-written,
enlarged and beautified, it
was natural to bestow upon it
u new title. On the first night
The Chieftain stormed the
passes to public favour, and
appears likely to occupv them
for some time Nothing

life, more musical, more mirth-

since its palmiest days. Sir

particularise merit. But Miss FLORENCE ST. JOHN and Mr.
COURTICE POUNDS in the French duet, Mr. PASSMOHE from first to
last (especially in his Bolero dance, one of the funniest things for
a long time seen on the operatic stage), Miss EM M IK OWEN in her
graceful movements, and the sextet with its merry music and its
laughing dance, are things to see and hear.

THE NEW HEROINE.
(A Scene from the Drama of To-morrow.)
Edwin. And do you really love me?
Angelina. With all my heart and soul; and yet
Edwin. Yet what? _ ANGELINA, why do you look^so strangely at
me P There is something on your mind, something you have not the
courage to tell me.
Angelina. EDWIN, I can hide nothing
from you. Even though it should wreck
both our lives, you have.the right to know
the truth.
Edwin. My own darling, what is in your
heart?
Angelina. Can you bear to hear it? Don't
look at me, or I shall not have the courage
to say what must be said. EDWIN, I have
never lived a disreputable life.
Edwin (burying his face in hit hands).
Great Heaven! and I believed in you so
utterly. (Then rising, with a desperate
effort to control his emotion.) Good-bye.
Angelina (falling on her kneet, and
clinging to him). Ah, no, you shall not go.
Think of it, EDWIN, of the temptations to
virtue that surrounded me, of the examples
of simple girlhood that poisoned my youth.
If I have lived a life of spotless innocence,
remember, at least, that I knew no better.
What else could I do? Brought up from
earliest infancy by a mother of unblemished
reputation?
Edwin (with a gesture of horror). Your mother, too? ANGELINA,
our marriage is impossible.
Angelina. How hard you men are. Is your sex alone to have the
monopoly of innocence? Must there always be one law for women
and another for dramatic authors'( Oh, it is cruel! cruel! But you
will not leave me. Remember, I am still young: it is never too late
to err. And is it because I am a woman that I am to be denied the
chance of retrieving the innocence of a mis-spent youth by the indis-
cretions of a riper womanhood? Besides, are there not cases, cases
known to us both where a wife has lived down the terrible reproach
of a blameless girlhood? Why, even Mr. JONES'S latest heroine, and
there is nothing later than that, could not absolutely prove she had
gone wrong, and yet her husband took her back! But you are so
proud, so relentless. You have no pity in jour heart.
Edwin. Believe me, it is not pride. For myself, I would gladly
brave the censure of the world, and if in after years men should say
in scorn he married her though there was nothing against her, I
should still be happy, knowing I had your love. But my father,
that dear old man in his quiet, country vicarage. Think of it? It is
too horrible!
Angelina (with hatred head). You are right, I had forgotten your
father.
Edwin. How could I ever look into that sweet, wrinkled face, and
meet those reverend eyes, knowing that I was asking him to receive
as a daughter one who had never even once strayed from the paths of
virtue?
Angelina. I see it all now, good-bye.
Edwin. Good-bye.
Angelina (as he is going). EDWIN, come back.
Edwin. Ah! don't torture me, I can bear no more!
Angelina. But what if I were to tell you that this confession, so
humiliating to us both, was but a ruse to test the strength of your
devotion.
Edwin. Ah. don't raise a false hope within me, only to plunge me
again in the abyss of despair.
Angelina. But this is no false hope.
Edwin (eagerly). What do you mean?
Angelina (burying her head on his shoulder). I mean that I have
been no better than I should be.
Edwin (embracing her). My own true love, nothing can part us
now.

(By the Sight Hon. the Author of' The Platitudes of Life"
M.P., f.R.S., D.O.L., LL.D.)
CHAPTER II.—De Quibusdam Aliis.
"CLEANLINESS is next to Godliness"; so runs the witty aphorism;
and modern bacteriologists "explain clearly the reason, and show
why it is so,"' the italics not being in the original. The use of
water is an effectual element in cleanliness. Men have been known
to brush their teeth with it. Of soaps there are many; but water is
practically one. "libra />'«," said THALES. And, again, "There is
a tide in the affairs of men," 3 as Lord BYBON put it, in confirma-
tion of SHAKSPEARE'S previous statement.
Fresh air contributes largely to the health. "In aere salus," said
the Romans; though some, for want of knowledge, have rendered
this, "There is safety in flight"; and others, for want of the
direresis, have supposed it to mean, "Tip a policeman, and he will
carry you over the crossing."
Yes, indeed, how wonderful is the air! Not only confined, as in
aerated bread or waters, but in the open. By it we breathe and
smell and sail on ships. Also the fields are full of buttercups. And
then the weather! How much of true happiness depends on conver-
sation, and how much of this on the weather! Yet " there is really
no such thing as bad weather, only different kinds of good
weather." * This true thought has often helped me in a London fog.
Again, the open air suggests games and railways. "Games are
admirable." * Did not Lord NELSON rightly say that the battle of
Trafalgar was " won in the playing-fields of Eton?" He referred of
course to the floods. Railways take us about through the air.
RUSKIN speaks of the advantage of increasing the "range of what
we see," forgetting for the moment his views about locomotives.
Among other forms of recreation men reckon Art and meals and
their wives' relations. I say nothing of the Drama, though the other
day I came across the statement that " All the world's a stage."'
Another recreation is letter-writing. Lord CHESTERFIELD wrote
letters. But be careful. If you have written a cruel letter, put a
stamp on it, lest it come back upon your own head.
I have spoken of a man's wife's relations. This implies marriage.
"The wise choice of female friends is ... important."8 "Grapple
them to thy soul with hoops of steel,"' as a writer lately put it,
thinking, perhaps, of the Elizabethan skirt. There are risks in mar-
riage. It is "for better for worse."8 This distinction is well brought
out in the two following passages—" And oh! if there be an Elysium
on earth, it is this, it is this!"* and "Wedlock's a saucy, sad,
familiar state." 10
One might throw out some thoughts on the question of selection,
but, as a friend aptly and originally expressed himself to me—
"Silence is golden"; and I remember to nave read that "talking
should be an ext reise of the brain and not of the tongue." '' Substitute
"writing" for " talking," and "pen" for "tongue," and I really
wonder why I have written all this. Can it be that I regard the
reading public as " mostly fools" ? u

OH, CHAMBERLAIN, with joy I note the labour of the file
In this delightful sample of your literary style.
I seem to see you trying it in half a hundred ways,
Before your taste could settle on the perfect final phrase.
With just a little polish here, a slight erasure there,
You got it into shape at last, and made your copy fair.
Lo, how its graceful suavity all meaner folk rebukes,
In evo.ry little word I trace the influence of dukes;
The gallant style, the courtly thrust with controversial sword
Of one—what need to tell his name ?—who dearly loves a lord;
Who learnt amid our feudal halls the ancient courtesy
That scorns to stoop to Billingsgate, or ape the bold bargee.
Serene and proud he follows still the good old maxim's plan,
And by his manners proves himself to all the world a Man.

Yours was a close shave, but I 'm bound to say
That February the twenty-ninth far worse is,
And worst of all, to come on All Fools' Day,
Like BISMARCK—or the writer of these verses 1
From Lincoln to Scotland, should blare up.

"ONE MAN ONE JOB."
A Christmassy Story for the Members of the L. C. C.
MR. BLANK THREKSTARS was an eminent member of the London
County Council, and had distinguished himself as a supporter of the
cry, "One Man One Job." In his opinion a workman should stiuk to
hi s work, and try no other. It' ha were a bricklayer, he should lay
bricks; if he were a painter, h-i should daub doors with colour.
"We don't want one man interfering with another man's business,"
said Mr. BLANK THREESTARSJ "Let the shoemaker stick to his last."
And this declaration »)' policy made him extremely popular in his
own set. He was considered a sound reformer. "Sound" in more
sense? than one, as he happened to be particularly partial to the tones
of his own voice.
One day about Christmas time, when the holly and mistletoe were
much in evidence, Mr. BLANK THBBRSTAKS happened to be reading
the reports of hi< own speeches at Spring Gardens, and unconsciously
closed his eyes. When he reopened them, he found a gentleman in a
black costume, who invited nim to give his opinion on things in
general and the London County C.uncil in particular. Rather
pleased to bj asked to air his eloquence, Mr. BLANK THREESTABS
readily c >mplied with the obliging request. He talked long and well
and the gentleman in black seemed never weary of listening to hi'u.
When he paused for a moment his attentive visitor put a question to
him which "set him off" again. And this was repeated quite a tcorr
of times. At length, however, the orator became exhausted.
"Why do yon cease speaking?" asked the gentleman in black
rather impatiently.
"Because I am very tired," was the reply; "and now, with your
permission, I will go lor a turn on my bicycle."
"Not at all. Your job is to speak, and I cannot let you do any-
thing else. So please continue your interesting remarks. What do
you think of the report upon the City of London?"
Poor BLANK THREESTARS attempted to give his views on the
subject, but broke down. He was extremely exhausted; but the
| this, and answered that, until the eminent Member of the London
County Council became almost senseless with fatigue. He closed his
eyes once more, and when he reopened them, found that his own
servant was landing by his side.
"Going to Spring Gardens, Sir?" asked the faithful adherent.
"If vou are it is time to be off."
"No," returned Mr. BLANK THREESTARS; "never again. I shall
n-sign. I have had enough talking to l;i-t me a lifetime."
From that moment BLANK THHEF-STAKS became a changed character.
He goes in for all sorts of hard work—wood-outtiug, cricket, football,
and golfing—but he never approaches the L. C. C. In fact, he has
only mentioned Spring Gardens once since his converMon, and then
only to link with its name an expression usually represented by the
fourth capital letter of the alphabet. And with this declaration his
story must come to an end, as ne declines to utter another syllable in
explanation.

IF vou 're ever in want of a subject for verse—

to settle
Your subject. Here's one which
was given to me—
II< nc long would a bat keep alive in a

How long_ would it be, ere it felt
getting worse,
And seriously thought it must give
up the G
(Where G is the ghost), and how soon
would a hearse
Be required for the poor little corpse.
Or with glee
Would the sprightly small animal
gaily make free,
And kick up its heels in the finest of fettle,
Considering it all as a wonderful spree—
How long would a bat keep alive in a kettle t
Now it wouldn't be truthful to say that my purse

Yet 1 don't mind confessing I 'd gladly disburse
All I have got to know who it was—he or she—
Who fooled the poor bat to so great a degree.
But it's really high time to take hold of the nettle
And end this ballade (you must spell with an «)—

"blow the water-drinkers I" Foolish fanatics! They surely forget
that for every bottle of "the boy" bestowed on an insensible, unap-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE CHRONICLES OF A RURAL PARISH.1
VII.—THK REAL THING.
THE poll is over, and the Parish Council for
Mudford is at last a. fait accompli—or almost
so. Yet, before I come to relate the story of
the polling, there are one or two matters which,
as a conscientious historian, I think I should
not he justified in omitting.
As I ought to have mentioned before, I did
not think it necessary or expedient in my
candidature to hold any public meetings.
Speaking broadly, I declared to win with
Miss PHILL BURTT on Canvassina. It was
far otherwise with some of my fellow-candi-
dates. BLACK BOB and his mates (lUunv
JORKIHS and WILLIAM BROWTT) got down
from town a young glib-spoken fellow, who
made a magnificent speech, with a Gladstone
peroration, that was supposed to be worth
any number of votes. BLACK Bon (I am
told), in proposing a vote of thanks to him,
somewhat cruelly called him "a cool, honest
and straightforward lecturer." One of these
briefless barristers, no doubt. Mrs. LETHAM
HAVITT and Mrs. ARBLB MARCH held a joint
meeting (not to be confounded with a meat
tea) in support of women candidates, addressed
by six enthusiastic ladies who pointed out the
various fields of energy provided for woman
by this new Engine of Reform. The vicar,
the squire, and I, alone out of the eight, con-
tented ourselves with no perfervid platform
appeals.
1 should also state that, as the poll grew
nearer, my wife became increasingly confident
that I should be beaten—" and that,TiMOTHY,"
she added, "you won't like." I pointed out
(mid I still think it was a natural thing to do
in the circumstances) that the most formida-
ble obstacle in the way of my succeeding was
the apparent lack of interest taken in the
affair by my family. This made MARIA per-
fectly furious. I needn't imagine I should
bounce her into it that way; truth to tell. I
never for one moment did think so. She
would go away and stay at our town house
with the girls till the whole affair was over—
which she did. So, uncheered by wifely counsel
or daughterly devotion. I sallied forth on
the morning of the 17th to my Committee
Rooms, thence to carry on the last stage of
this great contest. I plume myself upon the
excellence of my arrangements. Everywhere
you were bidden (that is you would have
been if you had been at Mudford) to "Vote
for WINKINS, the Local Candidate." I am
free to admit that there was nothingdistinc-
tive in this description of myself. »^e were
all local candidates, since we all lived in the
village it?elf. But this appeal to "local"
feeling is always an excellent card to play.
I know in my own case that I secured five
votes at least from men who at the last
General Election had voted for our sitting
Member because he was the "local candi-
date." Then I got some boys to carry round
a Big Loaf and a Little Loaf, adorned with
suitable placards, inciting persons, men and
women, married and single, to vote for me.
I did this because I never knew of an election
yet in which the loaves did not play a promi-
nent part. 1 was determined to leave no
electoral device—legitimate electoral device,
of course, 1 mean—untried.
Except for the masterly precision and per-
fection of my arrangements, the polling pre-
sented few incidents. There were the usual
number of people who did not find their
names on the register, and who were conse-
quently turned away sorrowing. (By the
way, is " and who" right'( I am never sure.)
Equally, of course, there were some idiots
who would put off voting till it was too
late, and..fiimi<l themselves shut out by one

CAUTIOUS.
Visitor (at oul-of-the-way Inn in the Ninth). "Do YOU KNOW ANYTHING AIIOUT SALMON
POA<'HINO IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD?"
Landlady (whose son is not above suspicion). "En—NO, SIR. MAYIIE IT'S A NK\V BTTLK OF
COOKINO AS WK HAVBN'T in inn OF IN THESK PARTS, AS TOD SRK, SIR, WE OVLY DO OCR
Eoos THAT WAY; ASD"—(brightening up)—"IF YOU HKK 'KM, I CAN GKT YOU A DISH
AT ONCBI"
At nine the poll closed: and the countine
immediately commenced. I did not feel equal
to the strain of being present, and was repre-
sented by Miss PHILL BURTT. I waited at
the house in grim suspense. Suddenly I
heard wild cheering. Then a minute later:
Miss PHILL dashed up waving a paper ex-
citedly and shouting, "Hurrah! Top of the
poll." And so it proved to be. I, who had
neen last, was actually now first. Here are
the figures:—
TlMOTITY WlNKINS, J.P. . . 219
G. TRAVIS-MKRTON (the Squire) 203
ROBERT HEDGER (BLACK BOB)
HARRY JORKINS . . .
WILLIAM BROWN
HENRY SANDFORD (the Vicar)
Mrs. LETHAM HAVITT .
203
195
189
172
I had hardlv grasped the significance of
these figure? when the crowd surged up over
the lawn. In a few brief, heartfelt words I
thanked them. The greatest moment of my
life—should never forget this kind apprecia-
tion on the part of those amongst whom I had
lived, and amidst whom I hoped to die—
wished them all a merry Chrisfmas and good
night. And so—they went—home.
The most curious point remains to be noticed.
Mrs. LETHAM HAVITT and Mrs. ARBLE MARCH
tied for the last place. The Returning Officer
declined^ to give a casting vote. Our Parish
Council is to consist of seven Members. The
first six are easy enough to find out. The
latest Mudford puzzle is—Find the seventh.
I had nearly forgotten to add that my wife
(who comes home to-morrow) has written to say
minute.
she hopes I 'm satisfied now. Well, I am.
Mrs. AHBI.F. MARCH .

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON OHAUTVARI.
THE CHRONICLES OF A RURAL PARISH.1
VII.—THE REAL THING.
THE poll is over, and the Parish Council for
Mudford is at last a. fait accompli—or almost
so. Yet, before I come to relate the story of
the pi ill i nir, there are one or two matters which,
as a conscientious historian, I think I should
not be justified in omitting.
As I ought to have mentioned before, I did
not think it necessary or expedient in my
candidature to hold any public meetings.
Sneaking broadly, I declared to win with
Miss PHILL BITRTT on Canvassing. It was
far otherwise with some of my fellow-candi-
dates. BLACK BOB and his mates (lUuitv
JORKINS and WILLIAM BROWN) got down
from town a young glib-spoken fellow, who
made a magnificent speech, with a Gladstone
peroration, that was supposed to be worth
any number of votes. BLACK BOB (I am
told), in proposing a vote of thanks to him,
somewhat cruelly called him "a cool, honest
and straightforward lecturer." One of these
briefless barristers, no doubt. Mrs. LETHAM
HAVITT and Mrs. ARBLE MARCH held a joint
meeting (not to be confounded with a meat
tea) in support of women candidates, addressed
by six enthusiastic ladies who pointed out the
various fields of energy provided for woman
by this new Engine of Reform. The vicar,
the squire, and I, alone out of the eight, con-
tented ourselves with no perfervid platform
appeals.
I should also state that, as the poll grew
nearer, my wife became increasingly confident
that I should be beaten—" and that.TraoTHT,"
she added, "you won't like." I pointed out
(:ind I still think it was a natural thing to do
in the circumstances) that the most formida-
ble obstacle in the way of my succeeding was
the apparent lack of interest taken in the
affair by my family. This made MARIA per-
fectly furious. I needn't imagine I should
bounce her into it that way; truth to tell. I
never for one moment did think so. She
would go away and stay at our town house
with the girls till the whole affair was over—
which she did. So, uncheered by wifely counsel
or daughterly devotion. I sallied forth on
the morning of the 17th to mv Committee
Rooms, thence to carry on the last stage of
this great contest. I plume myself upon the
excellence of my arrangements. Everywhere
you were bidden (that is you would have
been if you had been at Mudford) to " Vote
for WINKINS, the Local Candidate." I am
free to admit that there was nothing distinc-
tive in this description of myself. We were
all local candidates, since we all lived in the
village it?elf. But this appeal to "local"
feeling is always an excellent card to play.
I know in my own case that I secured five
votes at least from men who at the last
General Election had voted for our sitting
Member because he was the "local candi-
date." Then I got some boys to carry round
a Big Loaf and a Little Loaf, adorned with
suitable placards, inciting persons, men and
women, married and single, to vote for me.
I did thii because I never knew of an election
yet in which the loaves did not play a promi-
nent part. I was determined to leave no
electoral device—legitimate electoral device,
of course, I mean—untried.
Except for the masterly precision and per-
fection of my arrangements, the polling pre-
sented few incidents. There were the usual
number of people who did not find their
names on the register, and who were conse-
quently turned away sorrowing. (By the
way, is "and who" right? I taa never sure.)
Equally, of course, there were some idiots
who would put off voting till it was too
late, and. found themselves shut out by one

CAUTIOUS.
Visitor (at out-of-the-way Inn in the NwtK), "Do YOU KNOW ANYTHING Anour SALMON-
POACHING IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD 1"
Landlady (whose son is not above suspicion). "En— NO, SIR. MA.YDE IT'S A NK\V STTLK OF
COOKING AS WK HAVBN'T HKARD OF IN THBSB PARTS, AS TOD SKR, SIR, WE OILY no OCR
EGGS THAT WAT; AND"—(brightening up)—" IP TOO LIKE 'KM, I CAN GET you A DISH
AT ones I"
At nine the poll closed: and the counting
immediately commenced. I did not feel equal
to the strain of being present, and was repre-
seated by Miss PHILL BCTRTT. I waited at
the house in grim suspense. Suddenly I
heard wild cheering. Then a minute later
Miss PHILL dashed up waving a paper ex-
citedly and shouting, "Hurrah! Top of the
poll." And so it proved to be. I, who had
neen last, was actually now first. Here are
the figures:—
TIMOTHY WINKINS, J.P. . . 219
G. TRAVIS-MKRTON (the Squire) 203
ROBERT HRDGER (BLACK BOB) 203
HARRY JORKINS . . . 195
WILLIAM BROWN . . 189
HENRY SANDFOKD (the Vioar) 172
Mrs. LETHAM HAVITT . 153 \ „<•
I had hardlv grasped the significance of
these figures when the crowd surged up over
the lawn. In a few brief, heartfelt words I
thanked them. The greatest moment of my
life—should never forget this kind apprecia-
; tion on the part of those amongst whom I had
', lived, and amidst whom I hoped to die—
, wished them all a merry Christmas and good
night. And so—they went—home.
The most curious point remains tube noticed.
Mrs. LETHAM HAVITT and Mrs. A HUM: MARCH
tied for the last place. The Returning Officer
declined to give a casting vote. Our Parish
Council is to consist of seven Members. The
first six are easy enough to find out. The
latest Mudford puzzle is—Find the seventh.
I had nearly forgotten to add that my wife
(who comes home to-morrow) has written to say
minute.
she hopes I 'm satisfied now. Well, I am.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
A BABONITE warns me thusly: In opening The New Standard
Elocutionistj selected by ALFRED H. MILES (HUTCHINSON & Co.),
you may think there is a mistake somewhere, as on the first page
you are confronted with an anatomical sketch of a cheerful-looking
gentleman with his chest laid open for inspection. Don't be afraid,
it's all right, the gentleman's countenance is reassuring, still, it
makes me wonder if all reciters come to that. But after reading a
little of LENNOX BBOWN'S chapter, we find it is an object lesson
teaching the usually inflated reciter how to work his diaphragm as it
should be worked. Perhaps its advantages may be felt when the
elocutionist wishes to rouse an admiring but slumbering audience
with a little thundering out of "Rise! sleep no more." If the
average recitation has a soporific effect, PHIL MAT'S drawings in
Fun, Frolic and Fancy, by BYRON WEBBER will soon wake you up.
The annual of three F's quite fulfils the " promise of May."
Though Kitty Al»ne, by 8. BARINO GOULD, runs through (food
Words this year, edited by DONALD MACLEOD, D.D., she does it sur-
rounded by excellent company. Just imagine how a child's preeon-
ci'iv.-d notions of euphonious spelling will be upset by teaching
Artful Anticks spelt with a k, by OLIVE HEKFORD (GAT AND BIRD).
Such a frivolous liberty to take with any word in these days of solid
moral educational principles.
There always exists a pertain sneaking friendly feeling for ghosts,
especially at Christmas time, but it's nothing to the Paddies who ex-
perience a hurtful resintment if you won't list«-n to their familiar
banshee yarns, and Banshee Castle, by ROSA MULHOLLAND is full of
their sighing and wailing; they like to make themselves heard.
Jl propos of Christmas numbers, my Baronitess writes: The Queen
and The Gentlewoman present themselves beautifully "got up."
They are both decidedly smart, and, like their titles, their stories are
by a very select company. By-the-bye, in The Gentlewoman the
little bird says that htr New Year will open with an exciting
serial, Soni of Fire, from the indefatigable pen of Miss BRADDON.
There is a hearty, warm sound in it, agreeable at this time of the year.
According to the researching remarks of JOSFPH JACOBS, who has
arranged a new and selected edition of ^Esop's Fables (MAC-
MII i.\\ & Co.), one gathers that the "modest violet" is not in it
with the retiring manner in which every other writer of fable have
hidden their w>rth unHer the sheltering leaves of the ever green
laurels of Old yEsop. Their number mwht be 'prmed fabulous. But
SHERLOCK HOLMES has nut lived in vain. With unerring instinct
the true mythical authors have been tracked, and their deeds
brought to light. The immortal gt-nius may at last enjoy his own
wealth, which he finds fits better n»w that it has not to be stretched.
Quaint little pictures, done by RICILAKD HBIGUWAY, adorn the
pages.
"A pretty volume of fairy tales," writes one of the Assistant
Readers, "comes from Messrs. SM;I.KV & Co. It is called Lily and
the Lift, and is not only written, but also illustrated, by Mrs.
HERBERT RAILTON. /.//// herself, the little heroine, who is wafted
in the magic hotel-lift through the regions of Fairyland, is a
lovely fairies abound in the marvellous country visited by Lily.
Mrs. RAILTON writes with delightful fancy and quiet humour, and
her illustrations add a great charm to a book which is bound to
please the little ones for whom it is intended."
In Furthest Ind (BLACKWOOD) purports
to be the narrative of Mr. EDWAKD CAH-
LTON, of the Honourable East India Com-
pany's service, comprising his escape
from the hands of the Inquisition at Goa,
his journey to the Court of the Great
Mogul, and. much else. It all took place
some two hundred years ago, and was
"wrote by his own hand in the Year of
Grace 1697." As for Mr. SYDNEY C.
GRIEB, he simply "edits the narrative
with a few explanatory notes," which is
very modest of him. The narrative is a
moving one, full of local colour, plastered
on pictures of the outskirts of India in
John Company's day. Mr. EDWARD CAR-
LYON is a properly pragmatical person, with true British obstinacy
knocking his head against any wall that comes in his way. 11 <•
makes my Baronite almost think kindly of the Inquisition. And
this is eenial at Christmas time, when we like to think well of
everybody, "and so bless us all, Pen-and-Inkysition included,"

THE GAY BABON DE BOOK-WOBMS.

A SLQUEL TO THE STORY OP UNO.
(A FABLB FOR THOSE WHO RESENT CRITICISM.)
In continuation Iwith apologies) of Mr. Rvdyard Kipling's clever
"Story of Ung," in the December Number of " The letter."
Now UNO grew exceeding bumptious along of his scribingg on bone;
And he sware that no one could judge them save only the scriber
alone;
And he cocked his nose at the critics (save such as effusively
praised),
And he prated of " Art for Art's sake," till the tribesmen imagined
him crazed.
And UNG grew exceeding abusive, and proudly " uplifted his horn,"
With an Oscar Wildeish swagger, with a more than Whist lerian
scorn.
He kicked with the wrath of a KIPLING at "the dull-brained
bourgeois lot,"
(Though he put it in different lingo, for this Billingsgate then
was not.)
But the prehistoric for "Philistine!" fell from hi< scorn-curled lips,
Ami he lashed the non-artistic with words which would cut like
whips.
And the non-artistic tribesmen they cried "he is rixht, this UNG,
Though we doubt if the sabre-tooth tiger has got Mich a rasping
tongue:
"But there's truth in his 'Art for Art's Sake,' and Art for him
t-hall suffice."
So they shut him up, with his bones and hi-t tools, in a cave of ice.
No new-out tongues if the bison, no pelts of the reindeer there,
But only cold snow for cover, and only bare bones for fare.
For they said, "We are nowise worthy, we hunting and trapping
fools,
To judge of his fine bone-scribings, and the way he uses hia tools,
Only an artist can judge of an artist's work, and he
Is our only maker of pictures, our only man who can see.
"80 he must be artist and critic and purchaser all in one!"
And UNG admitted their logic, but he did not fee the fun.
He cried " I am cold and hungry I" Then they said, "O picture-
man,
Art for Art s sake is your motto; then live on your Art— if you can.'''
And UNO essayed to do so—by gnawing his graven b >nes.
But he did not find them nourish, and he beggeii iu humbled tones
For a lump of stranded whale-meat, succulent, fat and hot;
In return tor which, if they cared for his bones, they might take the
lot.'
80 they let UNG out of the ice-cave upon these liberal terms,
And cured the fool of regarding his fellow-mortals as worms.
And whenever ye hear Art craskpots a-wagging an insolent tongue.
darling. Beautiful butterflies, wonderful birds, quaint dwarfs, and
Why then—in the words of RUDYARD—heed ye the " Stiiry of fng.''

by moonlight}. Won't this be the
sort of thine-?
Mater, (shocked}. How can you,
John 1 Don't you know that Mrs.
Brown lost her husband only a year
ago?
Pater. Then why are you wish-
in? her " A Merry Christmas"?
Mater. Well, you see she ha«
married again, and so I thought of
Fending her something with "A
Happy New Tear " in it.
Pater, (taking up a i-ard showing

this?

Mater. Well that would be better,
but then she might think that the
owl was intended for a sneer at her
second husband. And then I al-
ways like to keep the happy new
year cards till Christmas is over, as
you can send them afterwards to
the people who have remembered
yon when you have forgotten
them.
Pater. But you wouldn't have
'' A Merry Christmas,1' and now you
object to "A Happy New Year."
What do you want?
Mater. Can't yon get something
impersonal?
Pater, (taking up card). Well,
here's a yacht in full sail.
Mater. Oh, how cruel! It will
remind her of her cousin who was
lost at sea!
Pater, (selecting another sketch).
Then why not this bouquet of
flowers?
Mater. Not for worlds! One
never knows what the flowers may
mean, and we might offend her.
Pater, (trying again). Well, here
is a windmill.
Mater. My dear John, you are
absolutely provoking. A windmill
is suggestive of frivolity, and I
wouldn't let Mrs. Brown think that
we meant that on any account.
Pater, (making another selec-
tion). Well, here's a parrot in a
cage.
Mater. You surely are not
serious? Fancy sending such a
card! Why, as everyone knows
that dear Mrs. BROWN is rather
talkative, all the world would say
it was an " insult."
Pater, (losing patience). Oh,
hang Mrs. BROWN!
Mater. I am ashamed of you,
JOHN! And I suppose you would
hang the cards, too! You would
curse " Merry Christmas."
Pater, (promptly). That I would,
and what is more, I would—well
never mind—the glad New Year!

THREE CHRISTMAS GREETINGS.
BEFORE the fireside's ruddy glow
I sit, and let my thoughts fly free;
Lo, these my Christmas greetings go
To three good friends beyond the sea.
Vain is the winter tempest's wrack,
It cannot keep my greetings back.
Oh wind and rain, and rain and wind,
How purposeless and blind ye are,
Like fate, for fate was surely blind
That bade my three friend's range afar.
Like mine, perchance, their fancy strays
To other scenes and distant days.
Dear FRANK, I think I see you now,
My flaxen-haired American,
Brave heart, grey eye, unclouded br>w,
Two stalwart yards of wilful man,
How oft in laughter and in song
With you I sped the hours along.
Ah me, the days were all too short,
Too swift the unreturning hours
In that old town of Hall and court,
Of ancient gateways flanked with tower*
Where once we feared the near exam..
And dared the dons, and stirred the Cam.
You went, and now expound the law
(As Humble said, the law 'H a hass)
And argue, as I note with awe,
For litigants in Boston, Mass.;
And, though you wear no warlike suit,
They call.you " General" to boot.
And, FRED, how fares it now with you
In that drear country of the North 'f
Too great your needs, your means too few,
A whim of temper drove you forth.
On far Vancouver's shore, alone
You hear the sad Pacific moan.
With us, God wot, you little throve;
Your life all fire, and storm, and fret,
Against relentless fate you strove,
But strove in vain—and yet, and yet
God shapes in storm and fire his plan,
And moulds a world or makes a man.
Good luck be yours on that bleak shore,
Some fortunate, some golden prize;
Then be it mine to see once more
Those frieudly, lustrous, Irish eyes.
Return and face with us your fate,
The world is small and England great.
You shall return and fill vqur place,
But never shall I clasp his hand,
Whose bright and smiling boyish face
Makes sum-bine in the shadowland.
Yet shall the night my heart beguile,
And let me dream I see him smile.
Your voice I may not hear again.
Oh dear and unforgotten friend,
Beloved, but ah! beloved in vain,
Whom love could mourn, but not defend.
Still take, thoueh far and lost you dwell,
My love, .dear Huop, and so farewell.
And thus before the fireside's glow
I sit and let my thoughts fly free;
Lo, these my Christmas greetings go
To three good friends beyond the sea;
To FRANK, to FRED, and ah, to you,
Beloved, irrevocable HUGH.

A:DOG ON HIS DAY.
(A Pitiful Epistle from Pongo to Mr. Punch at Christmastidc.)
EVEBT dog has his day—so they say,—
And mine it seems comes round once a year,
When all the painter fellows mix their blacks and browns and
yellows,
And paint me, in some attitude that's queer.
And unnatural, and tilly; spilling milk or supping skilly;
With a bonnet or a bib on, or tied up in bows of ribbon!
Oh, the Dogs' " Decline and Fall" might inspire a doggish Gibbon!
And they make me most unhappy, and my temper sharp and
fnappy,
Do these pictures poor and pappy. I 'm a decent doggish chappie,
But in gaudy Christmas Numbers, watching o er the sloppy
slumbers
Of a baby pink and prdgy; or squatting scared and stodgy,
Like a noodle of a poodle—oh! its really wretched foodie !—
At a beetle or a frog staring wildly, in a fog,
Or lapping baby's custard, or refusing baby's mustard,
Or dress'd up like a guy, or winking t'other eye,
In a gown, trimmed with down, like a clown,
Or coquetting with a cat,
Or chasing that old rat
Down that everlasting hole in the stable! On my soul,
A dog as is a dog. and not a duffer,
When the Yuletide pictures come is bound to suffer
Endless agonies of shame at the loss of his good name
As the sonrie friend of man, and a watchful guar-di-an,
Not an adjunct of the nursery!
At this happy anniversary
(Mr. Punch)
I could cr-r-r-runch!
The daubers who malign me, and such stupid roles assign me.
Why.it'» tcorse than hydrophoby .'!!
Mr. Punch, do turn on Toby,
As our champion canine to request each painter chap
To turn off the old stale tap of the porridge and the pap, and the
baby in the cap, or the kid (who needs a slap) and the pug (not
worth a rap) in an apoplectic nap, the toy-terrier on the snap, or
a-sniffing at a trap, or essaying milk to lap, like a small pot -
bellied Jap; and all the old clap-trap
Which makes a decent doggy in shet-r desperation say
That he 'd rather be a kitten with a ball and string to play,
Or live on clockwork rats, or make breakfast on chopped hav,
Or be smeared aU o'er with mustard like a cold beef sandwich,—Aye!
Or—whisper .'—Bite a Baby! 1—on the nose!! in nursery play!!!
Better dare renewed distemper than amther Christmas Day! f
For unless I have your promise—and dear Toby's—I much fear
AN AFTERPART A LA L. C. C.
As the L. C. C. have taken in hand the morals of the music halls,
and shown an inclination to supersede the Lord Chamberlain, it
may be as well to publish a rough sketch of a specimen scene from
the afterpart of a pantomime for the guidance of theatrical managers
desirous of standing well with the successors to the members of the
Metropolitan Board of Works. The "opening" would, of course, be
written by "a serious bard with a mission." No doubt the story
would be told in a manner most productive to the manufacture of
prigs. The transformation over, Clown, Pantaloon, Harlequin and
Columbine would be discovered in a group.
Clown (in the conventional tone). Here we are again!
Bumble (representing the L. C. C.). Scarcely. Allow me to point
out that in future you will be entirely different.
Clown (as before). Come along, old 'un; let's make a butter slide.
Bumble. You must permit me to interpose. The Council cannot
recognise any practical joke of the kind. If you wish to have the
?ame sort of fun, pull up the streets in the most frequented thorough-
fares in the metropolis—the Strand and Fleet Street for choice.
Clown (as before). Oh, here's a baby! Let's smash it!
Bumble. Please accept my advice. The Council do not object to
the keeping down of baoies in the abstract. But personal violence is
contrary to the law. If you really wish to decrease the surplus
population, why not work it to death at a b'jard-school? It nmy
be a slower process than throwing it over a lamp-post, but the
incident will be truer to life, and therefore more convincing.
Clown (as before). Oh! old 'un, here's a peeler coming!
Bumble. Pray be under no apprehension. Until the Police Force
is placed under the direct control of the Council, the members will
do their best to protect you. It stands to reason that a great
community like London should have its own guardians under its
own direct control.
Clown (as before). And now let's jump through this building.
Bumble. Again I must put my veto upon your proceeding*. If
you were to iump through that wall no doubt a placard would appear
hearing the legend " Somersault Place." This mieht be apt, but no
change in the nomenclature of the streets can be permitted without
the direct sanction of Spring Gardens.
Clown (as bffore). And now let's p»-lt this house, and all who's in it!
Bumble. Stop, stop! You are attacking our own sacred building.

BRAVE bringer-baok of old Romance
From shores so few may see,
Who oft hath made pur pulses dance
Wilt thy word-wizardry.
We wished, who loved thee long and well,
Thy life as endless as the spell
Which lured us lingeringly
To loiter, like a moon- witched stream,
Through thine enchanted world of dream.
We mused, with much-expectant smile,
On that strange life afar,
Flower-girt, in yon Pacific isle,
Whereto an alien star
Had drawn thee from thy northern home,
Scourged by a greyer, chillier foam,
Yet dear as the white bar
Whose snowy break home-haven marks
To battered shore-returning barks.
And now across the sundering seas,
Delayed, unwelcome, dread,
Comes news that breaks our dreamful ease.
The Great Romancer dead ¥
It comes like an unnatural blight.
That sunny vision quenched in night,
That subtle spirit fled?
One-half our best soul-life seems gone
Out like a spark with STEVENSON.
Enough for fame that hamd had wrought,
But not enough for those
Who dreamed his dream, who thought his
And grieve that so should close [thought,
Before the poet-Prospero's wand
Had wrought the spells he chose.
Without Aim amaranth-blooms to cull
The world looks Stygian now, and dull.
Teller of Tales, those southern folk
Their Tusitala hailed.
Stimoan hearts may mourn the stroke.
We, who must leave unsealed,
Save in fond fancy, that high peak
Where he is tombed, who, though flesh-weak
In spirit never failed
More than his stalwart fathers,—we
Send half our hearts across the sea.
The lighthouse-builder raised no light
That shall outshine the flame
Of genius in its mellowest might
That beacons him to fame.
And Pala's peak shall do yet more
Than the great light at Skerryvore
To magnify his name,
Who mourned, when stricken flesh would tire,
That he was weaker than his sire.
Teller of Tales! Of tales so told
That all the world must list.
Story sheer witchery, style pure gold,
Yet with that tricksy twist
Of Puck-like mockery which betrays
The wanderer in this world's mad maze,
Not blindly optimist,
Who wooes Romance, yet sadly knows
That Life's sole growth is not the Rose.
Dreamer of dreams! Such dreams as draw
Glad through the Ivory Gate,
In rapt and visionary awe,
The soul alert, elate;
And a strange Limbo of wild whim,
Upon us seem to wait,
In solemn pomp, when willing thrall
To him who held the keys of all.
Thinker of thoughts, fresh, poignant, fine,
Wherein no wit may trace
That burthen of the Philistine,
Chill, barren Commonplace.
Who hath not felt the subtle stroke
Which can in one choice phrase invoke
The soul of charm and grace.
Haunting the ear like an old rhyme,
A cherished memory for all time?
No more, no more! We shall not see
Again the glorious show;
No more will wake the wizardry,
Nor the charmed music flow.
Samoa's silence holds it hushed,
The voice whereat our cheeks have flushed
A hundred times; and lo!
For happy hours, for haunted days,
We can out pay with sad, proud praise!
OKACKKKS.—TOM SMITH, the up-to-date

"The Gatling Gun Cracker." The repeating
process will be an uncertain pleasure—to
others. Then "Snap Shots," taken unawares
by a naughty little Cupid—we can imagine the

A, DOG ON HIS DAY.
(A Pitiful Epistle from Prngo to Mr. Punch, at ChristiiMstide.)
EVEBT dog has his day—so they say,—
And mine it seems comes round once a year,
When all the painter fellows mix their blacks and browns and
yellows,
And paint me, in some attitude that's queer,
And unnatural, and tilly; spilling milk or supping skilly;
With a bonnet or a bib on, or tied up in bows of ribbon!
Oh, the Dogs' "Decline and Fall" might inspire a doggish Gibbon!
And they make me most unhappy, and my temper sharp and
tnappy,
Do these pictures poor and pappy.
But in gaudy Christmas Numbers,
I 'm a decent doggish chappie,
— watching o er the sloppy
in gaudy Christmas
slumbers
Of a baby pink and pcdgy; or squatting scared and stodgy,
Like a noodle of a poodle—oh! its really wretched foodie!—
At a beetle or a frog staring wildly, in a fog,
Or lapping baby's custard, or refusing baby's mustard,
Or dress'd up like a guy, or winking t'other eye,
In a gown, trimmed with downt like a clown,
Or coquetting with a cat,
Or chasing that old rat
Down that everlasting hole in the stable! On my soul,
A dog as is a dog^, and not a duffer^
When the Yuletide pictures come is bound to suffer
Endless agonies of shame at the loss of his good name
As the sonfie friend of man, and a watchful guar-di-an,
Not an adjunct of the nursery!
At this happy anniversary
(Mr. Punch)
I could cr-r-r-runch!
The daubers who malign me, and such stupid rules assign me.
Why .it's irorse than hydrophoby!!!
Mr'. Punch, do turn on Toby,
As our champion canine to request each painter chap
To turn off the old stale tap of the porridge and the pap, and the
baby in the cap, or the kid (who needs a slap) and the pug (not
worth a rap) in an apoplectic nap, the toy-terrier on the snap, or
a-sniffing at a trap, or essaying milk to lap, like a small pot -
bellied Jap; and all the old clap-trap
Which makes a decent doggy in sheer desperation say
That he 'd rather be a kitten with a ball and string to play,
Or live on clockwork rats, or make breakfast on chopped hav,
Or be smeared all o'er with mustard like a cold beef sandwich,—Aye!
Or—whisper .'—Bite a Baby!!—on the nose!! in nursery play!!!
Better dare renewed distemper than amther Christmas Day! f
For unless I have your promise—and dear Toby's—I much fear
AN AFTERPART A LA L. C. C.
As the L. C. C. have taken in hand the morals of the music halls,
and shown an inclination to supersede the Lord Chamberlain, it
may be as well to publish a rough sketch of a specimen scene from
the afterpart of ;i pantomime for the guidance of theatrical managers
desirous of standing well with the successors to the members of the
Metropolitan Board of Works. The "opening" would, of course, be
written by "a serious bard with a mission." No doubt the story
would be told in a manner most productive to the manufacture of
prigs. The transformation over, Clown, Pantaloon, Harlequin and
Columbine would be discovered in a group.
Clown (in the conventional tone). Here we are again!
Bumble (representing the L. C. C.). Scarcely. Allow me to point
out that in future you will be entirely different.
Clmon (at before). Come along, old 'un; let's make a butter slide.
llmii/i/i: You must permit me to interpose. The Council cannot
recognise any practical joke of the kind. If you wish to have the
same sort of fun, pull up the streets in tb« most frequented thorough-
fares in the metropolis—the Strand and Fleet Street for choice.
Clown (as before). Oh, here's a baby! Let's smash it!
liinnlili'. Please accept my advice. The Council do not object to
the keeping down of babies in the abstract. But personal violence is
contrary to the law. If you really wish to decrease the surplus
population, why not work it to death at a board-school P It may
be a slower process than throwing it over a lamp-post, but the
incident will be truer to life, and therefore more convincing.
Clotcn (as before). Oh! old 'un, here's a peeler coming!
Bumble. Pray be under no apprehension. Until the Police Force
is placed under the direct control of the Council, the members will
do their best to protect you. It stands to reason that a great
community like London should have its own guardians under its
own direct control.
Clown (as befure). And now let's jump through this building.
Humble. Again I must put my veto upon your proceeding!". If
you were to jump through that wall no doubt a placard would appear
hearing the legend " Somersault Place." This ink-lit be apt, but no
change in the nomenclature of the streets can be permitted without
the direct sanction of Spring Gardens.
Clotcn (as before). And now let's pt-lt this house, and all who's in it!
Bumble. Stop, stop! You are attacking our own sacred building.

same publishers), or so much ink would not have been wasted. '' After
perusing this cheery little book, the much encouraged aspirant,"
quoth our Baronitess with a sigh, "for literary fame, will promptly
lav down the pen and write no more." Good news for the editors.
MISS BBADDON, in her delightful story Christmas Hirelings (SIMP-
KINS, MAKSBALL & Co.), hits upon a novel suggestion for those folks
who don't know how to keep the festive season as it should be kept.
Away flies boredom! How ¥ I will not reveal the secret, but if any
nicely suppressed little children possess an average Scrooge-like'
relative, take my advice, and present him with this book. The
result will be more than even a child's dream can anticipate. Rather
powder in jam to boys will be The Battle of Frogs and Mice, by:
the immortal Mr. Barlow, with so much kind thought for youthful
learning. It may be Greek to many who have but a dim, far-off
knowledge of the first great burlesque writer: but this his
book will bring it all Homer again to us. Quite a relief to turn to
our dear Nonsense Songs and Stories, by EDWAHD LEAK (FREDERICK
WARNS & Co.) Vague yellow undulating pessimism notwithstand-
ing, how pleasant is real good nonsense! And even the fairy story
cannot be crushed by our juggernaut modern science, than which the
imaginative impossible, as in Thought Fairies, by HELEN WATERS,
and in the Seren Imps, by KATHLEEN WALLIS is so much more
attractive to youthful brains. Both books itsued by DIODY, LONG,
& Co., and wise of them to do so. MACMILLANS issue a splendid new
edition of the wonderful Gullirer's Travels, with over a hundred
illustrations by CHARLES E. BROCK, which ought to make the book
go uff like BROCK'S fireworks. Its very warm cover suggests a season-
able book, A. Rights Merrie Chrutmaste, by JOHN ASIITON (Leaden-
hall Press), who, fancying that some of its customs and privileges
might be forgotten, collects all that has been done or could be done
at this annual event. Some of ye anciente goinges on make one
wonder whether feasts were better kept when they spelt with such
unreasonable euphony. It must have been " merrie in halle" when
the wassail song was ordinarily sung as depicted by A. C. BEHREND
in his exquisite copper etching.
London Society is peculiarly bright and cheerful this Yuletide,
and keeps up its excellent reputation. A good medley is London
Society. And here is a very bright little Woman this Christmas-
tide. Quite a festive party with her capital stories and supplement
of "Types of the World's Women." Just "Woman, lovely
woman in all styles and shades. Without being more vain than
any other average islander, one feels grateful for belonging to the
British group—no offence to the other ladies, to whom we takeoff our
hat, and, whilst including the rest, salute advancing Wontan. "And
it is this New Woman, not the New Woman of the period, whom,"
quoth the Baron, " I salute with pleasure," and to whom he wishes
a happy Christmas and a prosperous New Year, and signs himself

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
READING BETWEEN THE LINES.
(A Physician's Protest.}
ME. PUNCH,—As a specialist of some standing and experi-
ence, I wish, Sir, to coll attention, through the medium of
your valuable paper, to the injurious effects of a certain occu-
pation upon the minds of the individuals engaged therein, and
to the advisability of taking steps, before it is too late, for
their protection.
The occupation to which I refer is that of devising and
arranging what I understand are technically known as "head-
lines" for the contents-bills of the more inexpensive London
evening papers—an occupation which I have no hesitation in
characterising, on evidence unconsciously supplied by the
sufferers themselves, as a highly dangerous employment.
I am not sufficiently versed, Sir, in the minutia? of news-
paper routine, to know what precise class of persons are
entrusted with this particular responsibility, though I have a
strong suspicion that it may be one of the many forms of
degrading drudgery which the selfishness of man has imposed
upon the weaker sex. If so, of course it only increases the
necessity for interference.
And, whoever and whatever the persons performing such
duties may be, it is painfully obvious that they are labouring
under conditions of mental excitement, the strain of which no
nervous system can support for any length of time without
inevitable and complete collapse.
Should there be any who consider this an overstatement on
my part, I merely ask them to give a glance at some of theee
same contents-sheets which are nightly displayed in our chief
thoroughfares. Let them mark the monstrous size of the
lettering, the peculiar extravagance of the epithets selected,
the morbid insistence upon unpleasant details, and then doubt,
if they can, that the unhappy persons employed in such an
industry are affected thereby with some obscure form of
hysteria. Otherwise, let me ask you, Sir, is it likely, is it
credible, that seasoned journalists, tough men of the world, in
touch with life at innumerable points, could, in a normal state
of health, be so constantly " Startled," "Amazed,"" Astounded,"
"Shocked" "Appalled," and "Revolted," as they admit them-
selves to be, almost every evening, by reports and rumours
which a little reflection would convince them were utterly
unfounded, or by events too ordinary and commonplace, one
might have supposed, to upset the mental equilibrium of a
neurotic rabbit f
Occasionally, too, there are symptoms of an excessive rev-
erence for rank, which, when found in the more democratic
organs (where, indeed, they are chiefly observable), denote a
somewhat distempered state of intellect, the delusion apparently
being that the mere possession of any sort of title renders its
owner immaculate. Thus, they announce with awestricken
solemnity "A Peer's Peccadilloes," or "A Baronet Bilks his
Baker," giving these events a poster all to themselves, as others
would an earthquake, or some portent of direst significance.
Now this loss of the sense of proportion in human affairs, Sir, is a
very bad sia-n, and a well-nigh infallible indicator of nerve-strain
and general overpressure.
But I find a yet more unmistakable evidence in support of my
contention in the extraordinary emotional sensibility revealed by these
headlines whenever some unfortunate person has been sentenced to
death for the most commonplace murder. There is clearly a profound
conviction that the jury who heard the evidence, the judge who pro-
nounced their verdict of guilty, the only possible conclusion they
could reasonably come to, and the HOME SKCKETABY who found him-
self unable to recommend a reprieve, were, one and all, engaged in a
cold-blooded conspiracy against a perfectly innocent man. The con-
vict has said so himself, and that seems to be considered sufficient.
A nd so, night after night, the authors of these headlines harrow them-
selves bj; announcing such items as " Blank protests his innocence to
bi-> Solicitor." "A Petitionin Preparation. "Painful Interview."
"Blank Hopeful." "Blank Depressed." "Distressing Scene on
Ihc Scaffold." "Blank's La»t Words."
Consider the strain of all these alternations of hope and despair,
repeated time after time, and almost invariably without evtn the
consolation of deferring the fate of their protege by a single hour!
1* it not too much for the strongest constitution to endure? a
service which society has no right to demand from any of its
members?
Yes, Sir, whether these devoted servants of the public know it or
not, they are running a most frightful risk; the sword which hangs
above their heads may fall at any moment.
Suppose, for example —and it is surely not wholly an imaginary
danger I foresee—suppose that some day some event should happen
somewhere of real and serious importance. Have they left them-

VERY HARD LINES.

all adequately? They have not; they have squandered participles
and adjectives in such reckless profusion that they will discover tney
are reduced to the condition of inarticulate bankrupts; and, speaking
as a medical man, acute cerebral congestion would be the very least
result that I should anticipate.
Or the determining shock might come from more trivial causes.
For instance, we might lose a distinguished statesman, or an iron-
clad, at the very moment when a football match was decided, or when
the professional tipster attached to their particular journal published
his 'finals." Think of the mental conflict before determining the
relative importance of these events, and awarding one or the other
its proper prominence on the posters; and then ask yourself, Sir,
whether it is an ordeal that anv human being of an impressionable,
excitable temperament should be required to undergo.
What precise remedy should be adopted I do not profess to point
out. Perhaps some one of the numerous leagues established to pro-
tect adult citizens against themselves might take the matter up, and
insist upon these contents-bills being set up for the future in smaller
type and with epithets of a more temperate order. Perhaps Parlia-
ment or the London County Council might be asked to interfere.
All that is not within my province. Sir, but this I do say: unless
some measures are taken toon, the heavy responsibility will be upon
us of having permitted a small but deserving class of our fellow-
creatures to hurry themselves into premature mental decay by the
pernicious and unwholesome nature of their employment.
I am, Sir, Your obedient servant,

I SWORE to you, dear, there was mistletoe there,
Though I knew all the time there was none.
As I stole a sweet kiss from you out on the stair
I swore to you, dear, there was mistletoe there.
I have plenty of sins on my soul, dear, to bear,
But at least I "ve confessed now to one.
I swore to you, dear, there was mistletoe there
Though I knew all the time there was none.

I am sorry. I never will do it again,
And please am I fully forgiven?
In the future from falsehood I mean to refrain.
I am sorry. I never will do it again,
But look at yourself in your glass to explain
Why to mistletoe tale I was driven.
I am sorry. I never will do it again,
And please am I fully forgiven?
There's an answer you '11 send if you 're thoroughly kind,
That will make me feel free from all blame.
I hope you '11 be glad, dear MELEXDA, to find
There's an answer you'll send if you're thoroughly kind.
It's this, "Though the mistletoe was but a blind.
Still with none 1 'd have done just the same."
There's the answer you '11 send if you 're thoroughly kind
That will make me feel free from all blame.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS.
GENOA in November. It is summer time. Put on thin suit, drink
my cafe au lait by open window, and stroll out into beautiful
Genoa, basking in the sunshine. Dejeuner in the garden of
a restaurant, among the old palaces. Sit in the shade, without my
hat. Think of aU the poor people in
London. Wonder if anyone is naving a
frugal lunch at the funny little open-air
restaurant in Hyde Park. Lemonade
and a bath bun in a fog. Should imagine
not.
Charming place, Genoa. Hardly any
Germans. Can at last hear people talk-
ing Italian. In Venice there are so
many Germans that one might as well be
in Germany. Sitting out on the Piazza,
one hears incessantly their monotonous,
guttural chatter, always in the same tone
of voice, without inflections, without
emotion, and, worst of all, without end.
Watched at the hotel table d'hote a Ger-
man lady sitting between two German
gentlemen. One man talked loudly with-
out ceasing, mouth full or mouth empty,
from soup to dessert. The other man,
rather older and feebler, also talked
without ceasing, but he could not equal
the other's noUe; he only added to it. As for the lady, her lips
moved all the time; one could imagine the ja icohl, the ach, so t the
ja, ja, fa, but one could not hear a word. At Florence, at Milan, on
the Lakes it is the same. If by chance one hears a Frenchman speak,
his charming language sounds more vivacious and melodious than
ever before. So it is good to be in Genoa, where even the best hotel
is kept by Italians. Apparently every other good hotel in Italy is
kept bv Herr SCHMIDT, or Herr WEBEK, or Herr SOMETHINGOHOTHEH,
and all the servants are German also. There is one hotel in Genoa
kept by a German. It faces the harbour. All night long there are
whistles, screams, bangs, rumblings, bumps, roars, and other sounds
from trains, ships, and tramways. All day long there is the same
noise, only more of it. But the Germans do not mind : they talk just
the same, and they make each other hear through it ail.
Charming place, Genoa, with a town hall that is the gayest
imaginable. Marble staircases, vestibules adorned with palms,
beautiful little gardens, at all sorts of levels, outside the windows of
the various offices. Everywhere flowers. If the town rates in Genoa
are paid at the Tewn Hall, the paying of them must be almost
pleasant. One would go with that horrible demand note, if that is
used also in Italy, and fancy that one was arriving at a ball. The
palm-decorated entrance looks just like it. It only needs a lady
rate collector, such as one hears of in England, and one surely, in
whatever manner the Italians may say it, would beg the charming
signora to give one the honour and pleasure of a daace, and scribble
her name on the programme—I mean the demand note. And no
doubt, the Italian officials being leisurely and the space being ample,
one could find time for a waltz in the intervals of rate paying, or at
least sit it out in one of the delightful little gardens of this ideal
Palazzo Municipale.
Aud so farewell to sunny Genoa, and off to Turin. German hotel
again, German proprietor, German servants. Solitary German
visitor drinking his morning coffee. The hotels of Turin are not
crowded; he and I are alone. What will the poor man do? He
must talk hi-i awful language to someone. He shan't talk it to uie,
for 1 will pretend I do not understand even one word. The waiter
has left the room. Must the poor man be silent'( Thunderweather,
ah no! HappilywUe he in savtd. The considerate proprietor,
thoughtful of his countryman's needs, enters; he stands by the
visitor's table, and the talk begins. When it ends I cannot sav, for
I leave them, well started and in good voice, and hear, as I think,
their sweetly miIndLius phrases fur the.last time in Italy. The
train carries me away. There is not much more of Italy now, for
bere is the Mont Cems tunnel. Farewell, beautiful country, beauti-
ful pictures, beautiful language! There is someone leaning out of
the next carriage window. No doubt he is also maddened; he is
speaking to others inside, his voice is cheerful, he is evidently
irying not to give way to despair. Now I hear what he says, "JJa
werde ich ein Glas liter trinkcn, ja, ja, ja!"

THE CHRISTMAS NUMBER OF PUNCH
LOED CHESTERFIELD'S POST-CARDS TO HIS SON.
No. I.—PRELIMINARY.
London, January 1, 0. S., 1895.
DEAR FRIEND,—Many years have elapsed since I laid down my
pen after writing a last Letter to you. A groat deal has happened
in the interval, including post-cards. If you remember—and
I trust what I have said to you as to the necessity of training your
memory has borne fruit
—wo had not at the
time of our earlier cor-
respondence even en-
velopes. You will find
post-cards a matter of
some convenience. But
let me beg of you to use
them with discretion.
For example, if you are
in communication with
Crowned Heads, avoid
the post-card. Even
with Ministers, whether
of State or accredited to
Foreign Courts, the post-
card should be sparingly
used. There is about it
a luck of distinction.
You will, perhaps,
with the audacity of
youth, cite two cases
against this dictum.
Ono is Mr. Gladstone,
the other the humble in-
dividual who addresses
you. But Mr. Glad-
stone, though not lack-
ing in parts, never had
the advantage of the
training in Paris and
elsewhere which your
father lavished upon
you. As for me, I trifle
with the post-card be-
cause it is a novelty, and
because its superficial
area is so limited that I
have covered it before I
have opened the topic on
which I desire to con-
verse with you, and have
so secured the pleasure
of writing to you again
at no distant date.
Adieu! May the graces
attend you, for, without
them, ot/iiifatica e vana.

THE N. W. NOTE-
BOOK FOR JANUARY.—
As a "New Woman,"
commence the first
month of the year with
novel ideas about the
place of man in Nature.
Remember that you are
his superior, and that,
having filled a subordi-
nate position for some
four thousand years, you
have to make up for lost
time. As a commence-
ment, revolutionise that
particular masculine institution, " the Club."_ Start a cercle of your
own. Have the usual coffee-rooms, smoking-rooms, and card-
rooms. Elect a committee. Then proceed to pill every candidate
put up for election. This will be done as a matter of course by all
who have the power of the ballot-box. The numbers naturally fall-
ing off, supplement the list of members by admitting visitors,
Follow masculine precedent, and offer hospitality to the opposite
sex. By this time you will have had enough of the Club, and the
OLD PODLER ON PROGNOSTICATION.
JANUARY.—On referring to his prediction for January last,
Old Podler finds he anticipated "grave internal complications
in the mechanism of the Automatic Sweetmeat Machines at one or
more of the principal Underground Railway station*." In proof of
the essential correctness of this forecast, he confidently appeals to
any unprejudiced observer who chanced to be on the platform of
Portland Road Station,
between the hours of
two and five on the after-
noon of Monday, the
22nd of January, to state
whether it is or is not
the fact that the butter-
scotch department of the
machine there was offi-
cially announced to be
"temporarily out of
order."
He notes, too, that he
predicted that the Beadle
of a well-known Arcade
would be afflicted with
chicken-pox; and hero,
again, he is proud to say
that the event fully
bore out his prognostic.
Old Podler is quite
aware that the amiable
and highly respected
official who controls the
destinies of the Bur-
lington Arcade wrote to
the papers, indignantly
denying that he had had
the disease in question.
But observe that Old
Podler named no names;
it is possible (as any
medical man will con-
firm tho fact) for a
patient to have the com-
plaint unbeknown, even
to himself, not to mention
that in this vast and
opulent metropolis of
ours there are more
arcades than one. Again,
the Archbishop of Can-
terbury and the Clown
at Drury Lane Panto-
mime were solemnly
adjured by Old Podler
to abstain from acid
drops; and it cannot bo
douoted that, had they
not taken the warning
to heart in time, they
would not be now en-
joying their preset, t
excellent health and
spirits. So much for
January.

Tire N. W. NOTE-
BOOK FOR FEBRUARY.
—Not entirely novel,
but novel enough for a
beginner. Produce a
newspaper. Editityour-
solr. Have all sorts of news. Remember the public love variety.
Be a Unionist one day, and a Radical the next. Why should not
all sides have their say? Have half-a-dozen contributors for each
subject. If they disagree with one another's opinions, so much
tho better. If your readers complain, tell them they are un-
reasonable. You don't bring out a paper to please them, but
yourself. If you find that your cosmopolitan sympathy with
everything becomes wearisome, give up journalism, and try some-
Club of you, so try something else.

THE CHRISTMAS NUMBER OF PUNCH
LORD CHESTERFIELD'S POST-CARDS TO HIS SON.
No. II.—ON GOING INTO PARLIAMENT.
London, March 1, 0. S.
DEAR FRIEND,—You are now about to enter the House of
Commons, a distinction and a turning-point in the career of any
young man. I shall expect to find in your hearing, conduct, and
success, the full flower of the seed I, writing to you in the middle
of last century, sedulously sowed. I forgot, at the momeut, under
which political flag you marched to victory at the poll. Home
people are disposed to attach significance and much importance to
that detail. For my part I
igard it as absolutely im-
re|_
material. You go into the
House of Commons to
83rve your country, not to
advance the calls of a fac-
tion. If you happen to
have been carried by the
Conservative vote, you
will do well from time to
time to declare yourself in
favour of Liberal propo-
sals and Liberal policy.
13y such a course you will
not only vindicate your
independence, but will
more rapidly and surely es-
tablish a position for vour-
self. Any man ticketed
Liberal or Conservative
can walk into the " Aye"
or ''No" lobby, according
as he is directed by the
party Whip. Any crank
becomes of importance
when party "\Yhips are not
sure on which side he will
vote on a given occasion.
Not that I wish you to
obtain the reputation of
being a crank. Indeed,
from what I hear of you
from the Abb<5 Guasco, I
believe you are unfitted to
play such a part. Be in-
dependent, but don't over-
do it. You see if, being
returned as a Liberal, you
vote steadily for the Con-
servatives, or rice, vend,
you lose all the advantage
of the manoeuvre, and are
open to the charge of apos-
tacy. In your voting, let
the unexpected occasion-
ally happen. Adieu.

timate acquaintanceship
with matters legal. Of
i -i mrse, never think of con-
sulting a solicitor. He
would be sure to give you
bad advice, and even if he didn't, you, as a New Woman, ought
to disdain to accept any service from the opposite sex. A text-
book will give you the common form of all legal documents up
to the date of appearance in open court, and then, when you reach
that stage, you should have a good time of it. Now, as a lady,
YOU can sot all rules of precedence nt defiance. Call upon the
Judge to help you, if you have any difficulties, for he is bound
to assist you. Bully the counsel, and in examining the witnesses
take due care to give copious personal explanations to the jury.
And if after all this you lose your case, why abandon the Law
Courts, and try something else.
OLD PODLER ON PROGNOSTICATION.
FEBRUARY.—Looking back, Old Podler is impressed with the
necessity for being careful what he says. He foretold, to quote his
precise words, "yrave tccuidall affecting a certain itutitutiou which
Old 1'odler dots not/eft hi mat If at lUwty to particularise more fully."
No reader who is at all up in current events can fail to see what
particular institution Old Podler had in his mind's eye when he
penned those memorable words. The case, however, being still
subjudice, further comment is undesirable. Then he went on to
say: "Parliarnint will reassemblf, and Westminster will If startled
by some serious esaii/es of
gas in the intmtdiate vici-
nity." For corroboratiou
of this apparently daring
utterance, the reader is
referred to the Reports of
Hansard. Which is one
more to Old Podler.
MARCH.— Old Podler
sees he refers to this as " a
singularly quirt and un-
eventful month," which it
was—for him, seeing he
was laid up throughout
with a bad leg and unable
to go into society, even so
contiguous as the •' Sal-
mon and Ball." He like-
wise added that" it would
nut titrjm'se him on or
nlxHtt the \Wh toJindPrim-
rose hill developing into
an active volciino;" also
committing himself to an-
nouncing a Simoom on
the Serpentine. When it
<foes so happen that Old
Podler makes a slight
slip, he hopes he has ever
had the manly courage to
admit it, and he is free
to confess that, so far as
he is aware, no signs of
volcanic eruption did, as
a matter of fact, take place
on Primrose Hill or near
it on that particular date.
Ho can only explain it by
some accidental shifting
on the part of his astro-
logical apparatus, which
the best of them will not
always be wholly free
from it. But there was a
simoom on the Serpentine,
though kept out of the
papers by the exertions
of the park-keepers, act-
ing doubtless from an
honest desire on their part
for the good name of the
| Gardens, or fearing it
j might have a deterrent
effect on the nursemaids.
THE N. W. NOTE-BOOK FOR APRIL.—You may be sure that as
a New Woman you have a better head for figures than man.
Why not take up horse-racing? If you are rich enough, start a
stable. Conduct it on the principle that nothing succeeds like
success. If a horse fails, sell him at any sacrifice. If a jockey
does not get a place, never employ him again. If a trainer is not
invariably the guardian of the winner, change him. If you are
less wealthy, go in for betting pure and (more or less) simple.
Lay wagers with the opposite sex. If you win, be sure to get your
money. If you lose, don't pay. Mind, you have to avenge the

DEAR FRIEND,—You will see
a good deal of Sir William liar-
court. Make your court to him,
but not so as to disgust in the
least Lord Rosebery, who may
possibly dislike your consider-
ing the Chancellor of the Ex-
chequer as the man of business,
and him only pourornerla scene,
Whatever your opinion may be
on this point, take care not to
let it appear, but be well with
them both by showing no public
preference for either. (By the
way, I find, on reference to the
printed volumes of my letters,
which you were so thoughtful
113 to present to me, that I
have saul this before. Of course
you will remember the pas-
sage in Letter CCLII, the
only difference being the sub-
stitution of the names of Mr.
Yorke and Lord Albemarle.
However, fane fait rien. I
anticipate the graceful remark
you were about to make that my
writing is not for an age, but for
all time. I thank you. Never
lose a chance of saying a pretty
thing, even to your father.)

tend in two desirable directions.
Your gossip, piqued by your in-
credulity, ana desirous of justi-
fying his information, will be
led into supplying you with
fresh points that may prove of
service to you hereafter. In any
case you will enjoy the advan-
tage of presenting yourself in a
loftier attitude than is assumed
by one eager to swallow any
malicious chatter. Moreover, if

No. IV.—ON THE IMMENSITY OK MANNER.
London, July 1, O. 8.
DEAR FKIENU,—At the risk of wearying you, I cannot say too
much of tho immense importance of good manner and uniinpjach-
able appearance. In the House of Commons you can never make
a figure without elegancy of style and gracefulness of utterance.
I might quote numerous illustrations which support this dictum,
whether as failures or successes. But 'twere invidious, and 1
refrain. Let it suffice — — —
that you are careful to
succeed by bestowing
the utmost attention
upon your air and ad-
dress. At the present
stage of j mr ca.-eer as
a buddin * statesman,
Professor Turv jydrop
is of more imp< rtance
to you than is a study
of May's others ise in-
i teresting and valuable
text-book on Parlia-
mentary Law an 1 Pro-
cedure. See tho Pro-
fessor daily, and apply
yourself diligently to
his instructions. De-
'sire him to teac'i you
i every genteel at'itu-le
that tho human body
[ can be put into. Let
him make you go in
and out of his room
frequently, and present
yourself to him as if
he were by turns dif-
ferent persons, such
as a Duke, an Irish
Member, the Prime
Minister, or even a
burglar. I should like
to know that even in
chance contact with a
person of this latter
class you wore able to
compoit yourself in |
the manner precisely
suit iblo to the occa-
sion. In respect of
making acquaintances
in the Ilo-.itm, before
formingparticularcou-
nections look about
you, and inquire into
their respective cha-
racters. Any of their
friends will tell you the
worst about them.
Ctileris ]*iribiii, single
out those of the most
considerable rank and
family. Show them a
distinguishing atten-
tion, by which means
vou will get into their
houses and keep the
best company. After .
you have taken your seat write to me at least once a week and
tell me whom you see, where you dine, and whom you meet.
Make a practice of writing from your seat in the House. If
possible, get a front seat below the gangway, and write on your
knee with the assistance of a pad of blotting paper. It looks
Ministerial, and in the eyes of tho House will insensibly associate
you with the Treasury Bench. Good night, yours.

as on the spot than ho had evei y right to expect. He hinted, in
somewhat amphibious terms, perhaps, but s!iil he did hint, at a
possible return on the part of the fair sex to the Crinoline. AYhat
tho Planets reiilly indicated was a revival of the CkyitOH, which it
will bo remembered showed symptoms of returning animation
about this period. But though his calculations came out a little
erroneous, Old Podler cannot consider that he was so rery far out
after all. And who

DEAR FRIEND,—It is more easy to conquer a continent than
to enter a room with perfect manner. It' this be true of au
ordinary drawing-room, how much more weighty is it in considera-
tion of walking into the House of Commons • Mr. Disraeli, a per-
sonage whom I regret circumstances prevented my knowing in the
flesh, deroted much, but not inadequate, time to acquiring the art ( f
walking up the floor of the Commons when the Speaker was in the
Chair. I gather from those familiar with the spectacle that it was
a little overdone. The fixed look, the solemn visage, the slow
movement, and tho bent head when he came within arm's length
of the Mace, suggested that this eminent statesman wus going to
a funeral rather than proceeding to the Treasury Bench. Mr.
OLD POOLER ON PROGNOSTICATION.
JUNE.—Old Podler felt it his painful duty to prepare the public
for " disaster in Ditlwich " during this month, being amj ly justified
by the facts, for ho ventures to say there are few residents of this
justly popular and highly salubrious locality who cannot recall an
incident which transpired about this period within their neighbour-
hood for which the tenn disaster cjinnot be considered inappropriate,
nor yet excessive. Ho also prophesied the advent of " « ,tew half-
penny evening pnper nfn highly peculiar colour." His impression was
that it would be published somewhere about Peckham. But (and
this only shows how extremely careful oven experienced prophets
ought to be in handling their instruments) ho must have made an
error of half a degree or so in his calculations, for the v.'per in
question actually appeared in PMu! So true is it that, as dear
Old Plato observes: " Nemo mortidibus omnium horm sapuit.""

Gladstone, I am informed, always pulled himself together as he
entered the House, and with head erect, shoulders thrown back,
and eyes respectfully fixed upon the Chair, marched to his place.
These great ensamples are withdrawn from your opportunities of
study. Happily Sir Richard Temple remains, and, by what I hear
from possibly prejudiced friends, is worthy your notice and emula-
tion. Sir Richard moves towards his place in the Chamber of the
Commons with the stately grace of a man who has consorted with
the ancient princes of India. His temporary withdrawal from the
House is, I understand, not less ceremoniously effected. Watch
him closely. Make him your model. Possibly - for genius is not
envious and loves to culture the capabilities of the young—he may
permit you to call upon him some day when there is no morning
sitting, and allow you to enter and leave the room under his per-
sonal direction. Ilulf an hour's practice with such a master would
outweigh the value of the written counsel of the fondest of fathers.

THINKING IT OUT.

IN TRAINING.
OLD FODLER ON PROGNOSTICATION.
JULY.—As the year advances, it will be ob-
served that Old Podler gets his Prophetic Eye
more and more in, and he is able to point with
pride to his prediction for this mouth as a signal
example of hiswoll-nigh miraculous powers of
vision. Here is the identical paragraph he
wrote a twelvemonth back: "Old Podler is
proud to firedict that gome time in this month an
emit will transpire wliick will redound to tlie
honour and glory of the nation at large, while
iheddiny i thrill of joy throughout the circum-
ference of the City and its milmrbs." And what
event did transpire, exactly as per prophecy:
Why, the christening of the firstborn son of
our future King and Queen, to whom Old
Podler respectfully hastes to tender his heart
felt congratulations! Home prophets would
expect a baronetcy for less than this—or a snug
pension at the very least — but Old Podler
scorns to cringe to Royalty for any such recog-
nition, being too much the astiologer and gen-
tleman for to demean himself—though not
unwilling to be met half miy.
AUGUST.—Old Podler is not the kind of
Prophet to crow, and, indeed, finding himself
right once more has become so much a matter
of courso with him that he haidly takes any
particular notice of it. Still, he is liumnii, and
it is no more than natural as he should feel
tome complacency in reminding readers that
he predicted the outbreak of the Chino-Japa-
nese War for this identical month! For what
were Old Podler's words? Why, these: " Old
Podler dreads to hear, also, of increased mor-
tality," And, making every all >wance for tb.9 Oriental imag'ni-
tion, he thinks there must have been lives lost to a considerable
extent, loth on land und sea. It is true his original prediction con-
cluded With the wirds, "amoiujst shrimps and slie'l-fiah generally."
But that, of course, was merely the Prophet's mystic manner of
wrapping of it up, though he would not be suspected of wishing to
hurt the feelingsof either combatants by alluding to them as "Crus-

THE COMPLETED ARTICLE.
LORD CHESTERFIELD'S POST-CARDS
TO HIS SON.
No. VI.—ON SUBSCRIPTIONS.
London, December 1, 0. S.
DEAR FRIEND,—There is one matter that
will early press itself upon tho consideration
of your new M.P.-ship. I mean the question
of subscriptions to local institutions among
your constituents. You may, perhaps, observe
that this is a matter which concerns me moro
than you. In one sense, rous tivez raixon. Like
Judas—by tho way, do not forgot that Judas
is not a Parliamentary word. Under no pro-
vocation apply tho term in debate even to
your dearest friend—like Judas (I may say
it of myself), I carry the bag, and, as you
know, make no objection to your reasonably
dipping into it. But the dispensation of your
(or mv) bounty will seriously affect votes, and
should be discreetly managed. In my time
the difficulty did not exist. With a few excep-
tions, constituencies were only too glad to get
as member a gentlemanly fellow, by prefer-
ence of noble birth, who once a year dined
at their ordinary, and occasionally got a berth
in the Customs or Post Office for their more
worthless sons. Now it is, I am told, different
There are churches to restore, chapels to build,
bazaars to open, hospitals to support, cricket-
clubs to subsidise, and football aasociatious
to keep in boots, feed, and victual. A member
of the present House tells me of a group of
his constituents who lived upon him for two
years simply by founding lootball Associa-
tions. When in a comparatively small borough the number reached
314, he set on foot inquiries which relieved him from further claims
under this particular head. In the matter of subscribing to foot-
ball clubs it is, if so accomplished a linguist will excuse the

DEAR FRIEND,—It is more easy to conquer a continent than
to enter a room with perfect manner. If this be true of un
ordinary drawing-room, how much more weighty is it in considera-
tion of walking into tho House of Commons': Mr. Disraeli, a per-
sonage whom I regret circumstances prevented my knowing iu tho

a little overdone. The fixed look, tho solemn visage, the slow
movement, and the bout head when he camo within arm's length,
of the Mace, suggested that this eminent statesman was going to
a funeral rather than proceeding to tho Treasury Bench. Mr.

JUNE.—Old Podler felt it his painful duty to prepare the public
for " disaster in Dnlwich " during this month, being ami ly justified
by the facts, for he ventures to say there are few residents of this
justly popular and highly salubrious locality who cannot recall an
incident which transpired about this period within their neighbour-
hood for which the term disaster can not be considered inappropriate,
nor yet excessive. He also prophesied the advent of " a .itw half-
penny Kveninij paper n/ti hiylily perulinr colour." His impression waB
that it would be published somewhere about Peckham. But (and
this only shows how extremely careful even experienced prophets
ought to be in handling their instruments) ho must have made an

THINKING IT OUT.

IX TRAINING.
OLD PODLER ON PROGNOSTICATION.
JULY.—As the year advances, it will lie ob-
sei-vod that Old Podler gets his Prophetic Eye
more and more in, and he is able to point with
pride to his prediction for this mouth as a signal
example of his well-nigh miraculous powers of
vision. Here is the identical paragraph he
wrote a twelvemonth back: "Old Podler i'«
proud to predict t/uit some time in tin's month an
emit will transpire which will redound to the
honour and glory of the nation at large, while
shedding a thrill of joy throughout the circum-
ference of the City and its suburbs." And what
event dirt transpire, exactly as per prophecy';
Why, the christening of the firstborn son of
our future King and Queen, to whom Old
Podlur respectfully hastes to tender his heart
felt congratulations! (Some prophets would
expect a baronetcy for less than this—or a snug
pension at the very least — but Old Podler
scorns to cringe to Royalty for any such recog-
nition, being too much the astiologer and gen-
tleman for to demean himself—though not
unwilling to be met half way.
AUGUST.—Old Podler is not the kind of
Prophet to crow, and, indeed, finding himself
right once more has become so much a matter
of course with him that ho haidly takes any
particular notice of it. Still, he is huinun, and
it is no more than natural as he should feel
some complacency in reminding readers that
he predicted the outbreak of the Ohino-Japa-
nese War for this identical month! For what
were Old Podler's words? Why, these: " Old
Podler dreads to hear, also, of increased mor-
tality." And, making even- all iwance for ths Oriental imag'ni-
ticn, he thinks there must have been lives lost to a considerable
extent, l.oth on land and sea. It is true his original prediction con-
cluded w.th the we rds, ''amongst shrimps and slie'l-Jieh generally."
But that, of course, was merely the Prophet's mystic manner of
wrapping of it up, though he would not be suspected of wishing to
hurt the feelings of oil her combatants by alluding to them as "Crus-

No. VI.—Ox SUBSCRIPTIONS.
London, December 1, 0. S.
DEAR FRIEND,—There is one matter that
will early press itself upon the consideration
of your new M.P.-ship. I mean the question
of subscriptions to local institutions among
your constituents. You may, perhaps, observe
that this is a matter which concerns ino more
than you. In one sense, roia arez raiton. Liko

is not a Parliamentary word. Under no pro-
vocation apply the term in debate even to
vour dearest friend—like Judas (I may say
it of myself), I carry the bag, and, as you
know, make no objection to your reasonably
dipping into it. But the dispensation of your
(or my) bounty will seriously affect votes, and
should be discreetly managed. In my time
the difficulty did not exist. With a few excep-
tions, constituencies wore only too glad to got
as member a gentlemanly fellow, by prefer-
ence of noble oirth, who once a year dined
at their ordinary, nnd occasionally got a berth
in the Customs or Post Office for their more
worthless sons. Now it is, I am told, different
There are churches to restore, chapels to build,
bazaars to open, hospitals to support, cricket-
clubs to subsidise, and football associations
to keep in boots, feed, and victual. A member
of the present House tells me of a group of
his constituents who lived upon him for two
years simply by founding lootball Associa-?
tions. When in a comparatively small borough the number reached
314, he sot on foot inquiries which relieved him from further claims
under this particular head. In the matter of subscribing to foot-
ball clubs it is, if so accomplished a linguist will excuse the
barbarism, le premier kick </ne a ate. If you give to one you

OLD PODLER ON PEOGNOSTICATION.
NOVEMBER.—Here Old Podler had the candour and straightfor-
wardness to own himself nonplussed for once last year, not allow-
ing himself to go beyond a discreet hint that there might be "o
devolution, mi or about the 9th, of the most exalted dignity in London's
vast city." But he was not, as might be expected by the superficial,
alluding to the Lord
Mayor's Show, at least
not altogether. What
he was more by way of
alluding to was the new
scheme of Municipal
Reform, which Old
Podler trusts may work
satisfactory, though not
desiring to pledge his
opinion either way—at
present.
DECEMBER. — The
year not having
advanced so far,
Podler is consequently
unable to play as loud a
pican as customary for
this month. If no is
not mistaken, he felt
himself called upon last
Autumn to warn all
aristocrats of his ac-
quaintance residing in
Eaton and E u s t o n
Squares against earth-
quakes. Dearly would
he like to retract those
ill-ominous words could
he do so without swerv-
ing from the strict path
of veracity he has ever
laid down for himself!
But the planets never
speak without fully
knowing their minds,
nor yet is Old Podler no
more but their faithful
interpreter. Another

much admired actor in
romantic comedy will lose

THE N. W. NOTE-
BOOK FOR DECEMBER.—
Having reached the last
month of the twelve,
you may possibly like to
sum up your career for
the past year. You will
have discovered that a
New Woman is not
always successful in
starting a club, writing
for the newspapers, ap-
pearing in person at the
Law Courts, keeping
race-horses, promoting
companies, reforming
society, concocting
"shocking" novels,
amusing the vagabond
population, shooting
birds, upsetting hospi-
tals, and last, but not
least, gaininga husband.
You may therefore, per-
haps, be a trifle dissatis-
