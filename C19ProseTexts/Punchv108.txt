A Midsummer Day-dream, and its waking Sequel.
T was the luncheon-hour at Lord's. Likewise it was exceeding hot, and Mr. PUNCH, after an exciting morning's cricket,
was endeavouring to cool himself with an iced tankard, a puggreed “straw,” and a fragrant whiff.
“Willow the King!" piped Mr. PUNCH, pensively. “Quite so! A merrier monarch than the Second CHARLEs is
WILLIAM (GILBERT) the very First! And no one kicks at King Willow, even in these democratic days. The verdant, smooth-
shaven lawn, when wickets are pitched, is your very best “leveller'—in one sense, though, in another, what stylish Richard
DAFT calls “Kings of Cricket' ('by merit raised to that good eminence'), receive the crowd's loyal and most enthusiastic homage.
But, by Jove, the Harrow boys will want a new version of their favourite cricket song, if prodigy be piled on prodigy, like
Pelion on Ossa, in the fashion to which the Doctor during the first month of Summer in this year of Grace has accustomed us.”
“The ‘Doctor's' throne has never been disputed by anyone outside Bedlam,” said a strong and sonorous voice.
Mr. Punch looked up, and perceived before him a stalwart six-footer in flannels, broad-belted at the equator, and
wearing broad-brim'd silken stove-pipe.
“ALFRED MyNN, quoting ‘the Old Buffer,' or I'm a Dutchman,” said the omniscient and ever-ready one.
“‘And, whatever fame and glory these and other bats may win,
Still the monarch of hard hitters, to my mind, was ALFRED MYNN ;
With his tall and stately presence, with his nobly-moulded form,
His broad hand was ever open, his brave heart was ever warm'—
as PRowse sang pleasantly.”
The Kentish Titan blushed—if Shades can with modesty suffuse. “You know everything, of course, Mr. PUNCH,”
said he ; “and therefore you know that the object of my visit is not to have my praises sung even by you or the Poet PRowsE,
but to back up that National Testimonial to the Cricketer of the century—and the “centuries'—of which I'm glad to hear
whispers in the Elysian Fields, where—alas!—we do not pitch the stumps or chase the flying “leathery duke' of Harrow
song.”
“Well, it's a far cry from Hambledon to Downend," quoth Mr. Punch, pensively; “but even the gods of ‘the
Hambledon Pantheon,’ as picturesque JoHN NYREN called them, might have admitted the Downend Doctor as their Jove.
Or, adopting his other figure, have made him the King ARTHUR of their Round Table, vice old Richard NYREN retired.”
“I see you read what is worth reading," responded the Kentish Big 'Un. “Dick NYREN's style was as sound and
honest and brisk as the English ale he lauded,—‘barleycorn, such as would put the soul of three butchers into one weaver.’
But the great Gloucestershire gentleman is worthy to bend the bow of Ulysses.”
“Or to wear the pads of ALFRED MyNN, which, I believe, were presented to him,” said Mr. PUNCH, cordially.
“Ah! There is another and a bigger Presentation afoot, I understand, thanks largely to a truly Gracious Prince,”

MR. PUNCH WELCOMES THE NEW YEAR.
So, 'Ninety-Five, my boy, you’ve come at last!
Another year has gone, and I am here
To greet you, as your brothers in the past
- Were greeted on their coming, year by year;
For it's always been my practice, Sir-a bit of Punch's lore—
Since the day that I was volumed, until now I’m fifty-four.
Aye, fifty-three New Years I’ve welcomed. This
I }. to Heaven in its arms may bear
A whole New Yearful of a nation's bliss—
- A world without a tear, without a care.
'Tis thus that I have F. ayed, young Sir, full many years before;
But to know hº oft I’ve prayed in vain, would make your young
eart sore.
The Year that's dead was better, sure, than some;
But even he brought with him strikes and war,
Whose ghastly horrors smote the soft heart numb
...And wrung and chilled it to the very core.
'Twas a villainous attention, this suffering and gore, Four
That we'd rather have dispensed with, from your brother 'Ninety-
But even he, my lad, a jest could work,
And on occasion smile, and nod, and beck;
To England gave—a rising Son of York,
And gave to Ireland—Mr. GLADSTONE's cheque!
Thus tickling Mr. BULL from smiles and laughter to a roar.
But hearty laughs like these, my friend, were few in 'Ninety-Four.
And you, young shaver, what is it you bring P
Razor and soap, like shavers young and #
The sºap to s othe, razor to cut and sting —
Will wedding-bell be heard, and death-knell toll'd P
You see, my lad, we're anxious as to what you have in store,
For there's ºil." things to put to rights bequeathed by 'Ninety-
our.
In Parliament, no doubt, you'll make your game—
In Camp, and Court, and County Council, too?
Make sport of love—make foul an honoured name—
And all the little fun you're wont to do?
Well-take my tip. Just do your level best, remember! For
The blame, my son, lies at your own, not Mr. Punch's door.
So mind, young Sir, for Mr. Punch's eye
Is cocked upon you ºft your little life.
Go-rule the world!—and if before you die
You fill the earth with joy instead of strife,
You'll be the first of all your race-for all the smiles they wore—
That gave the country what she asked—from 0 to ’94 |
PROTEST FROM THE PLAYGROUND.
... DEAR MR. PUNCH,- I know you sympathise, with boys, and isn't
it a jolly shame the masters set us such awfully hard questions in
exams. ? My Report has just come home, and my Pater has f:
me a fearful rowing, and all because it says “WILKINs Terts.
(that's me) has done hadly in Examinations, and does not take the
trouble to use what intelligence he possesses.” My Pater threatens
not to take me to the Pantymime, and I hear it’s awfully beefy this
year ! Well, we had a “History and General Knowledge” papcr;
and one of the questions was this beastly one, and of course I
couldn't tackle it—“What, or where, are the following:—‘In-
erium in Imperio, The Korea, Bimetallism, The Grand Llama,
alance of Power, and One Man One Wote?’” I answered all right
about the Korea, becauseſ kicked young SMITH, under the table to
give me a tip about it, and he said it was the book the Turks use in
church; and I put that down, but all the other things floored me.
Please will you say what Bimetallism is? Jonks Junior said after-
wards, in the playground, that it was a sort of lozenge, and Robinson
Senior said he didn't know what it was, but he knew his Pater was
a Bimetallist; and Jones said Robinson Senior's Pater must be
a cºnfectioner then; and so Robinson punched Jones's head; but
what is it? And is it fair to ask us boys such, questions? My
Pater said at breakfast the School Board was fond of sending out
sirkulers. Do you think they would send one to our Head-master,
and ask him to stop such rot?
Your obedient young friend JACKY.

SPORT IN COURT;
Or, The New Year Dream of the National Anti-Gambling
Leaguer.
OH ! it must have been the grog, for Islumbered like a log,
And I dreamed—such a dream! I was holding forth in court,
And *:Jºne” in the dock,-how the Sporting League 'twould
Wes. Prince, and the Nobles, and the Leading Lights of
port.
A supreme, successful raid on the Jockey Club we'd made.
No mere stuffy, sordid set, of poor betting-men this time,
No cheap winner-spotting snobs, but a lot of topping nobs,
And I had them on the hip, and I charged §. with Crime!
It was prime to see a Prince at my language flush and wince,
Andº º Chief Justice squirm, and a stern-faced Judge quite
enon.
But—I could not fail to mark the demeanour of the Clerk,
Who looked on it as a lark /–and that Beak upon the bench-
Ah! he had a mighty beak,” which I felt a wish to tweak—
Had a wink in his left eye which seemed frivolous, if funny;
And he didn't seem to suit us, for we wished a stern-faced BRUTUs;
Nay, a ruthless RHADAMANTHUs were the big-wig for my money.
Ah! it wanted resolution to conduct that prosecution,
With a Prince and several Dooks, and an Earl, a County Squire,
And a Mephistopheles, who sat lounging at his ease,
whº, the culprits all called “JIMMY,” and seemed hugely to
in Ire:
For although f º: and raved, Beak and Prisoners behaved
In a fashion which seemed scornful, and assuredly was light;
And that Clerk-confound his mug, which looked strangely like
a pug 1–
And #. chap for the defence, with his eyes so brisk and bright,
“Don’t old Mulherry Nose look funny ? I will bet you any
7nonety- I-
Well, I missed the wager's point; but oh, dear! oh dear! !
oh dear!!!
Think of betting—in a Court | And I thundered against Sport,
Which meant Gambling, more or less, and red ruin, and disgrace.
From the girls who, though they’re loves, wager wickedly—in gloves,
To the Plunger Peer who shames his ancient race—to win a Race.
Ah! I think I "gave them beans.” I’m uncertain what that means,
But the Lord Chief Justice whispered I was doing so—to “JIM’—
And the phrase I overhead, and although it sounds absurd,
I felt it meant a compliment to me, compelled from him.
So I said “Sport may intrigue and set up a rival League
To our !. Anti-Gambling One; but Sport is a Foul Sink
We have pledged ourselves to purge with a besom and a scourge—”
But here that Punchian eye indulged in a prodigious wink,
Such a spasm of sheer fun, that I felt the case was done;
Court, Prisoners, Judge, assumed the guise of a colossal Joke!
My head appeared to swim, the wild visiºn did dislimm,
And with a shriek of bitter disappointment I–awokel
“ANglo-INDIAN.”—We are indisposed to go the full length of
agreement with the learned Editors of the New English Pictionary

In the interesting extract you inclose they remark: “The conjec-

of which 1,600 went to a rupee (see YULE), is ingenious, but has no
basis in fact.” That may be so. It is, nevertheless, a curious coin-
cidence that at the present time the steady declension of the money
yalue of the rupee, combined with its immoveable rating in the salary
list, produces in the Civil Service and the army in India a state of
feeling subject to which at least 1,600 dams go to a rupee...We
much fear that, under this provocation, our army in India is able to

NEW YEAR NOTIONS.
(By an Old Buffer.)
“THERE is nothing new under the sun,” someone says;
I wish that there wasn't, by Jingo!
It seems to me everything’s New in these days,
And nothing is genuine old stingo.
A New Poet turns up about once a week
(According to log-rolling rumour);
And there's the New Politics, all grab and sneak;
And something dull dubbed the New Humour !
The New Art; I’m certain it comes from Old Nick,
It's so diabolic and dirty.
Faith ! some of their Novelties make me feel sick,
And most of them make me feel “shirty.”
The New Year!—well, that is as old as the hills.
The New Leaf-we annually turn it.
Ah! if the New Newness would banish Old Ills.
Not e'en an Old Fogey would spurn it.
New Year, give us books that are healthy and gay,
And Art that's not impish or queer, Sir!
And if you’ll but cart the New Woman away,
You will be a Happy New Year, Sir!
THE MODERN THEATRE LAUGH.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I crave the hospitality of your columns
under the following circumstances. The other night I went to
a burlesque. , Being a man of modest means, I contented myself
with paying half-a-crown, for which sum I was able not only to
sit with the plebs in the pit, but to see Society in the stalls.
Will it be believed, at the end of this so-called nineteenth
century, that songs were sung and things were said which made
those everywhere around me laugh? Sadder still, two-thirds of
those I saw were women!—women, who are our mothers and
sisters, when they are not our wives and sweethearts!
I haven't the least notion where the harm in all this comesin,
but I’m confident there's some somewhere. In any event it's
a serious sign of the times; which reminds me that I should

have sent this to the Times, if I had not thought the recent

and take to Telegraphic Correspondence.
In any case, I invite letters on “The Seriousness of

“RING out, wild bells.” We hope that you,
With '94 that's rung out,
Will kindly ring out just a few
Qf all those things entitled “new”
Which plagued us till quite mad we grew
As mad as dog with tongue out.
Those novelties! The newest kind—
With turned up nose and weird, slee-
-py eyes, that told of vacant mind,
And monstrous chignon massed behind—
Were those appalling things designed
y Mr. AUBREY BEARDSLEy.
Yes, “things”; for nought of human shape,
OWeWer º bizarre,
Is there portrayed; there's not an ape,
That feeds on cocoa-nut or grape,
Between Morocco and the Cape,
So hideous as these are.
For goodness' sake, don't let us see
New Art which courts disaster!
We much prefer to Mr. B.
VELAsquEz, REMBRANDT, even P.
P. RUBENs or WANDYKE, for we
Like oldness in a master.
And then “New Humour.” Heavens, why
It's but a pleasure killer!
A cause of weary }. and sigh
Which makes us almost long to fly
To those old jokes collected by
A certain Mr. MILLER.
In politics Newcastle, too,

And now #. leads, and shows who's

The Grand Old Man — there’s age for
you!—
Has found much better things to do,
Not prosy but poetic.
But all the things, so new in time,
Are nothing to the woman -
Who now is “new,” and seeks to climb
To heights which seem to her sublime;
(Excuse the execrable rhyme)
She is indeed a rum 'un.
Of course we know that youth is sweet;
Old women are not charming;
But no old woman we could meet,
With featless form and formless feet,
This wild New Woman now could beat,
She’s perfectly alarming.
Ring out, wild bells, wild belles like these
New-fangled fancies screaming;
Ring in the woman bound to please,
A lady, always at her ease,
Not manlike woman, by degrees
More man that woman seeming.
Old '94, who now has fled,
Encouraged blatant boldness'
In things called “new,” as we have said;

“SHOULD CHRISTMAS BE ABOLISHED7"
[A symposium on the above question appears in
the December Number of The Idler.]
WITH what philosophy sublime
The institutions are discussed,
Which foolish men of olden time
Were well content to take on trust
“Is life one great mistake P” we cry,
“Our modern teachers deem it so; ”
“Man’s place shall woman occupy P”
And now this last—“Shall Christmas go?”
They mock at any plea for mirth,
With fine derision they allude
To any wish for e on earth
As § a pulpit platitude;
This Christmas-time, it seems, is fraught
With fancies anything but clever;
The lessons that CHARLEs Dick ENs taught
Are obsolete, and gone for ever!
Thiſ tell us, in their stead, to praise
The jokes on seasonable ills,
The epigrams on quarter-days, -
The jeux d'esprit on mud and bills;
But as for honest glee and cheer,
Since every cause for joy’s demolished,
Wº: Christmas, too, it's amply clear,
Should be left out-in fact, “abolished.”
Well, let them talk; to please themselves
By all means let them demonstrate
That fairies, Santa Claus, and elves
Are manifestly out-of-date.
Well, let them talk; and find a joy
In cynical ;:
But every English girl and boy
Will give their empty words the lie!
Nor only these: In every land
When Christmas brings, to brighten life,
The sturdy grip of hand with hand, -
The softened heart, the ended strife, L
Then air your pessimistic views,
Then ask again, “Shall Christmas go?”
And find your answer, if you choose,
In one emphatic, hearty—“NO!”

“Look what I've Bought You For A CHRISTMAS Box 1"
THE CHRONICLES OF A RURAL PARISH.
VIII.-AFTER THE Poll.
I AM overwhelmed with congratulations, from all classes, from all
sections, from all ranks, and I am acclaimed on all hands as a worthy
head man for a Mudford, if not yet a model, village. Not the least
welcome have been the communications which have reached me
from those who have made my acquaintance in these published
Chronicles. The mayor of a borough whose charter dates well back
into the beginning of the second half of the present century, wrote
to say that he is emboldened by the fact that his wife's maiden
name commenced with a W to write to tell me how rejoiced he is to
hear of my success. A gentleman writes from “The Burning Plains
of the Sahara” to say that he is always proud of the triumphs of a
TIMoray. (My daughter points out that this is clearly a forgery,
since the Sahara mail isn't in till next week. But I can’t go into
that.) Then there is a very important letter from Birmingham, of
which I will only say that WINKINs, who has backed many a Bill,
may yet live to indorse a Programme. I may here add that there has
been an attempt. in some quarters to decry these Chronicles, as
absurd and imaginary. , My Birmingham correspondent describes
them as “an important picture of things as they actually are.”
He is right: I am as serious as a Prime Minister.

AFTER THE POLL.
After the poll is over,
After the voting's done,
Mudford will be much duller,
No more election fun.
But ONE man will be more happy,
Not so disturbed in his soul (?),
WINKINs's wife is come back now—
After the Poll!
Of course, I should have destroyed the card at once—but I was out
instance of the monstrous way in which one man's sin is another
man's punishment. In this, case.(1) it was my wife who had
persisted in going away, and (2) it was an unknown post-cardist
who hº written the insulting doggerel. Yet I paid the entire

holidays says. I think he's quite right. -
Our Parish Council meets next Monday—on the 7th, With the
New Year we commence our ºf: of bºneficent activity. I need
hardly say that it is certain that I am to be Chairman. My position
on the poll suggests it, common decency demands it, moreover I ex-
pect it. I refuse to believe that I shall be disappointed.

“A GLAD New Year!” Why, bless my heart, how fast
The time flies by. The year's no sooner here

No threatening clouds o'erhead exist to cast

THE WINTER ACADEMY OF 1995.
(An Elegant Extract from a Future Development.)
THE Committee this year has wisely been recruited from the
Master Bill Posters' Guild; the old-fashioned method of “han #5.
is alºndoned, and advertisements are now “stuck” on the walls by
the New “B”. Gum Process (for which Sir J. MILLBOARD contributes
a charming illustration, No. 20,000). During a preliminary survey,
we were astonished by the blatant excellence of the exhibition. “A
Bicycle Made for Five,” ** LowTHER. R. CADE (No. 2006), is
especially delicate and sudden; the tone is aluminium throughout,
and although no children are represented as bodily on the machine,
a Kineto-Phonograph inserted in the axle dexterously responds to a
}.} in the slot—when the youthful athletes are both seen and
eard in the adjacent horse-pond. “Gregory the Grateful”
(No. 612) fully sustains Dr. UTTERSON's reputation for historical
advertisement; by pressing a spring the Pope actually swallows the
powder, and seems to like it." It is quite equal to this Master's
‘Columbus in Wall Street” of last year. Mr. G. MoRLAND's
“Carter's Pill-gathering in the Old Kent Road” (No. 69) is too
realistic for modern taste; the fine oaks in the background are
absolutely hidden by placards; but Lord BoxALI's "While.there is
Life there is Soap” N. 15,000Z) is truly impressionist; the life is full
of soap, and the soap full of life. In “ Glycerine” (unnumbered), by
Miss Topsy TURvy (the Presidentess), we have a fine example of
: The Newer Symbolism,”—a patent revolving motor displays its
liquidity to equal advantage upside down. - -

AN “OLD MASTER'S " GROWL.
Burlington House, January 1, 1895.
It's all very pretty to hang us up here,
And º that you worship our genius and paint;
You fancy it’s “Cultchah '' that rings in the year—
But it ain't'
You find us, you say, “a delight to the eye; ”
You exclaim that “such painting you never did see'
You “do” us—then scamper below with the cry—
“Cup o' tea!”
---
“Old Masters,” indeed! . It’s “Young Students” with you—
To their show in your thousands you flock in the spring;
But of Me you exclaim, as you come in my view—
-- at a thing !”
Just six months ago in these rooms you'd declare
It was "exquisite Art” that you saw ; you forgot
That you'd said that of Us. Bah! What do you care?
Not a jot!
Of course, there are some who are men of the day,
Who belong to the band of the talented few;
Right gladly we put forth our hand, as we say–
“How de do?”
For example, young RAPHAEL–my excellent friend—
And the later Italians and Germans as well
They consider Sir FREDERIC_LEIGHToN no end
Of a swell
Then REYNoLDs declared, in the course of a chat,
The “Cherry Ripe” picture of MILLAIs to be
* As good as “ Penelºp. oothby.” What’s that ?
WAN DE WELDE asserts he knows less of a wave,
It's colour and drawing, than MooRE at his best.—
But when of your Coles and your HUNTERs you rave,
I protest!
Talk of TITIAN and WATTs in a breath—which you may ;
Young GILBERT and Swan you may praise if you will;
But the thought of the annual summer display
Makes me ill !
Yet that’s what the mass of the people enjoyed.
And the few who come here, both the great and the small,
Mostly come to be º: Whit—you think I'm annoyed P
ot at all !
We expect it.—I said just as much to WANDYCK-
There's but one in a hundred that comes who'll descry
The beauty of Art. It's the sham I dislike.
Well—good-bye!
HOW TO WIRITE AN EXTRA NUMBER.
(An Up-to-date fragment for Yuletide.)
THE author was hard at work. He heeded not the snow that beat
against the window, nor the wintry wind that whistled through the
'eafless trees. The fire burned brightly in the grate, and the
hadows on the walls seemed to inspire him with seasonable tales.
He wrote for dear life, as his
that the printers were cla-
mouring for more and more
from his facile pen. Every
now and again he glanced at
a volume of drawings (there
were many sketches in the
book on his desk), and, paus-
ing for a moment, seemed to
be lost in thought. Then he
would resume his labours
with fresh energy. Wery
rarely he would murmur to
himself, and then his words would be few.
“Confusion!” he muttered on one such occasion; “how the
Dickens (or should it be Thackeray?) am I to get in the Christmas
waits?” He pondered for a moment, and then his eyes glistened with
delight. “Eureka! I have it! They must appearin a dream, Yes,
that will get over the difficulty, they must appear in a dream l’”
And then he continued his writing. During the whole day he had
been hard at work. His breakfast was scarcely touched. e waved
away the servant girl who would have set before him his lunch. It
was now close upon his customary dinner hour, but still he insisted
upon isolation. Even the wife of his devotion did not dare to come
near him. She knew that he would not speak to her, but only cast
at her a glance. But such a glance! A terrible tirade compressed
into a solitary look!
The short day waned and passed away. The evening quickly
changed into night. There were cheery songs without, as it was
Christmas Eve, when all men were thinking of wassail, and holly
and mistletoe. Even the performers in the forthcoming pantomime
were nearing the close of their last rehearsal, when they would go
back to their homes to count the mince pies and glance for the last
time at the cooking of the familiar plum pudding.
At length the writer was interrupted, and by his old familiar friend.
“I will not disturb you,” said the caller, taking up a newspaper
and commencing its perusal; “I know _^
how busy you are, and will be silent as - -
Čornhillſon a sunday.” -
The writer nodded and continued his
work. His pen moved quicker and
quicker until at length it stopped.
“Hurrah!” shouted the author. “At
last my task is completed. I have
brought in every cut and got through
the necessary number of lines. Yes, my
dear old comrade, I have done. The
rinter will be satisfied, and the pub-
isher will cease to be alarmed. And
now, my dear fellow, I can enjoy Christ-
mas conscious of the fact that I have
thoroughly earned a holiday.” ----
“Ah!” observed the visitor. glancing at the recently-written
pages; “I see you have been writing something for Yuletide.”
*Yuletide.” exclaimed the author. “Why, that was accomp-
lished ages ago. No, my dear fellow, I have just finished a summer

THE POLITE GUIDE TO THE CIVIL SERVICE.
(By an Affable Philosopher and Courteous Guide.)
How To RECEIVE A DEPUTATION,
IT does not take very long to make yourself quite at home as
Secretary of the Public Squander Department—the office I will sup-
pose you to be filling. You will find everything ready to your hand.
All you will have to rememberisthis—the
golden rule of the Service—that what was
done last year, should be followed this,
and arranged for next. Ministries may
P. S. D. continues for ever. The policy of
the office must never be disturbed. If it
has been the custom (say) to put orange-
trees in the }. spaces under the con-
trol of the Department out to bloom in
February, under no consideration what-
ever must the date be changed. It may
be advanced (generally in the newspapers
when there is nothing more interesting
ripe for discussion) that July would be
the better month. It may be declared
that an orange-tree taken from a hot-
house and thrust into the uncertain
atmosphere of the Metropolis, and indeed
the provinces, stands less chance of
weathering that climate in the second
month of the year than it would in the
seventh. That may be very true, but
what has been done by the Public
- Squander Department once should be
- repeated for ever. If an alteration has
to be made it must not be accomplished except “under-pressure.”
Questions, must be asked in the House, returns moved for, and all
the rest of it., So long as the alteration can be resisted, it is the duty
of every member of the Department to stand shoulder to shoulder to
oppose. Yºu will find a casein point in the matter of your own pet
fº. the condition of ‘Milestones.” You will recollect (if you
ave a good memory) that “Milestones” were the steps of the stair-
come and Cabinets may go, but the thi
case that led you from the hall of Parliament to the comfortable
apartments reserved for the special use of the Secretary of the P. S. D.
“I do not think we need bother about those Milestones,” you will
say to the Chief Clerk after you have got accustomed tº your mes-
sengers and have chosen your easiest of easy chairs; “I daresay there
are many matters of more pressing importance.” - -
The courteous official to whom you have made the suggestion will
readily acquiesce, and then inform you that a deputation are anxious
to see you upon the subject. And #. you will find one of the dis-
advantages inseparably connected with making a question exclusively
your own. The moment you come into
power you are expected to do some-
ing. It is of course unreasonable,
but none the less for that unavoidable.
“I think you had better see them,
Sir,” the Chief Clerk will observe.
“They know the ropes fairly well, and
I do not think we shall get much
Fº until you have got rid of them.
f course, we have sent them travel-
ling a bit, but they have got back to
us at last.”
“Sent them a-travelling f" you
will §:
“Well, yes. We have referred them
to this department, where they have
been asked to apply to that. They
have been º on from office to
office until they have come back to us.
It is the rule of the game. And now
I think the time has arrived when you
should see them in person.”
Of course, you have nothing to
do but to take your subordinate's . . º
advice. It is one of the regulations of the Civil Service
wags, the dog. It stands to reason, that a man who has grown
; in the Department is more likely to know the business of the
ureau better than you who have just joined. So the spokesman of
the deputation receives a polite communication informing him that
3. will be pleased to see him and his friends at such and such a
te. Of course, you are furnished with the names of the friends in

advance, w". Your private secretary (your right-hand
man) makes it his special business to post you up in all
that is necessary about them. The day arrives, and
with it the deputation. If the House is sitting, you can
see the Members in your own room. If looks well if you
can show your accosters how small a chamber you occupy,
and how hard at work you have to be at all hours of the
day and night. Failing a meeting in Parliament, you
can receive them in the Department itself. . In this case
contrive, if possible, to see them in official uniform.
Chat with them after you have been to a levée, or Cabi-
net, or something of that sort. It gives you a distinct
advantage if you can overawe them with the glories of a
well-feathered cocked-hat, and many yards (chiefly on
the back of your º of gold lace.
You will have, of course, in attendance upon you
several heads of departments. These gentlemen will say
nothing, but will look wonders. If you are at loss for
figures or facts, you will glance at them and make a bold
statement. That daring declaration will, of course, be
qualified with the announcement that it is made “to the
best of your belief.” You will turn your face towards
the heads, and they will receive your mute appeal with
sympathetic attention. They will not say anything, but
will, I repeat, look wonders. They will not be compre-
hensible, but merely convincing.
Chairs will have been set for the members of the depu-
tation. Some of your visitors will be personally known
to you, and these you will greet with effusion. Remem-
ber that you must be nothing if not genial. Single out
for special cordiality the spokesman. Not, of course, one
of your parliamentary colleagues who is going to intro-
duce your visitors to you, but the principal member of the
deputation. If you have to contradict him in the course
of the interview you will have the sympathy of his col-
leagues, and they will be glad to see one who has the
pleasure of your acquaintance (why should he have it
more than they?) soundly snubbed. After every one has
got comfortably into their places, you will ask if the
Press are to be present. If th. reply is in the affirmative
(as it most probably will be, as all deputations like to see
themselves in print), continue your generalities, and say
with a good-natured laugh, “that you must be on your
guard.” If the interview is not to be reported, then you
require no further guide. You can say or do almost any-
thing in reason. But assuming that the reporters are to
be present (and here it may be observed that, if your
private secretary knows his business, the gentlemen of
the Press will to some extent be “selected”), you must
be more careful.
You will listento your parliamentary colleague's speech
of introduction and the address of your friend the spokes-
man with many silent tokens of goodwill. When there
is a trace of a compliment you will smile, and bow, and
if any figures are introduced you will ask to have them
repeated, and make a note of them on a piece of paper.
It does not matter what kind of paper you use, as the
piece will subsequently disappear into the basket reserved
for valueless documents.
You will ask several questions, and, when the spokes-
man has completed his harangue, you will look round to
see if anyone desires to follow him. If there is any
hesitation, commence your reply at once. But if anyone
is ready. let him speak. It is far better that the eloquence
of the deputation should come out (like the measles)
rather than be suppressed. When your visitors have had
their turn, then will come yours.
Of course the less you say the better. I do not mean
in words, but in purport. If you have time you can
chatter for an hour, but that chatter should be abso-
lutely innocuous. Remember not to give yourself away.
Mind, you are bound in office by nothing you have
nttered out of it. Be genial. Indulge in small jokes.
Let them be at your own expense. Complain that you are
powerless. Explain that had you your way you would do
all sorts of good things, but “that tyrant, the Chancellor
of the Exchequer,” interferes. It is not the fault of the
Public Squander Department, but the crime of the
Treasury. Wind up by assuring the members of the
deputation of your personal sympathy, and assure them
that you will take “an early º. of laying the
representations they have made before your colleagues.”
y following these directions you may be sure that you

TAV_\- TALES OF SPORT AND ADVENTURE.
(By Mr. Punch's own Short Story-teller.)
INTRODUCTION.
Not many living men, and even fewer in the ages that are past,
have—if I may use the word—sported with greater assiduity and
success than I have during a life which is even now little past its
middle period. . At one time on horseback, at another on the bound-
ing and impulsive elephant; now bestriding the matchless dromeda
on his native prairie, now posted on foot in a jungle, crowded §
golden pheasants in all the native splendour of their plumage; some-
times matching my solitary craft against a host of foxes on the swell-
ing uplands of Leicestershire, sometimes facing the Calydonian boar or
the sanguinary panther in their woodland lairs, dealing showers of
leaden death from a hundred tubes, or tracking my fearful prey by
the lonely light of a wax vesta and
despatching it at midnight with
my trusty bowie–wherever there
were leagues to be walked, risks to
be run, or fastnesses to be rushed
there not only have I been the first,
but (paradoxical as it may appear
there also have I succeeded an
have never been successfully fol-
lowed. My experiences are there-
fore unique, and it is in the hope
that they may to some extent profit
a younger generation, less inured,
I fear, to hardship and danger than
my own, that I now set pen to
paper and recount some of the
exploits that have made my name
famous wherever sport is loved
and true sportsmen are revered.
A less modest man might have
said more, but one whose deeds
speak for him in every quarter of
the world may well be content to
leave to punier men the ridiculous
trumpeting braggadocio that too
often makes so-called sportsmen Ş
the laughing stock of society. For
myself, I can never forget the
lesson I learned at an early age
from my dear father, himself a
shikari of no common order, though
to be sure, as he himself would -
the first to admit if he were alive,
the exploits of the son (I had no
brothers) have now thrust the Ž
arental performances into the 3
ackground. Still, it was my ºf
father who first inculcated upon -
my infant mind the daring, the 5
ignorance of fear, the contempt of
danger, and the iron endurance
hold word. Heaven rest the old
Sand, with no head-stone to mark his resting-place, and neither
the roaring of his old enemies the tigers, nor the bellowing of the
countless alligators who infest the spot can rouse him any more.
Alas! it was trustfulness that destroyed him. He was gored to
death by a favourite rhinoceros that he had rescued at a tender ":
when its mother was killed, and had brought up to know and, as he
thought, to love him. . But I have always thought myself that the
rhinoceros was a treacherous brute, and though I have often been
asked to tame one, for presentation to this or that Emperor, I have
consistently declined.
Marvellous, however, as my father was in his day for his exploits
and his variegated bags of game, he was perhaps even more wonder-
ful for the unswerving accuracy with which he was accustomed to
relate his adventures. Far and wide over the steppes of Central
Asia, the burning regions of equatorial Africa, the precipitous
haunts of the American Grizzly, and the wild retreats of the
ferocious Albanian pi verywhere, in short, where he had set
foot or drawn trigger, this peculiarity of his was known and appreci-
ated, and many a respectful sobriquet did it earn for him from the
savage tribes amongst whom he spent the best years of his life. In
Kashmir he was known as Peili Ton, that is, the man who cannot lie;
amongst the swarthy Zambesians the name of Gorun. Bettir (the Un-
defeated and Veracious Man) was a name to conjure with even when
in their moments of warlike passion the tribesmen rushed madly
through their primeval thickets, shouting their terrible war-cry,
“Itzup ures Leere,” that is, “Death to the white-faced robbers.”
But what I wished specially to relate about my poor father wa
the lesson of truthfulness which he inculcated upon me at an early
age. He and I (I was then but a lad of twelve) had been huntin;
the ferocious Pilsener gemsbock through the wild Lagerland in whicl
he makes his home. It happened one morning, that we, had parte.
company. To me was assigned the duty of beating through th
Bier-Wald, the dense forest which stretches mile upon mile in un
broken gloom to the confines of the Boose-See. e Fates wer
propitious. Wherever I turned I saw a victim, and one afte
another I brought down, with unerring aim twenty-four (as .
thought) of these noble animals, whose horns are now worth a king'
ransom, and might, even in those distant days, have rescued
minor German Prince from captivity. Hastening home with m:
booty loaded upon my back—I was a strong boy for my age, but o
course nothing to what I have since become—I met my dear fathe
just as I reached the door of the hut which served us for huntin
quarters. Joyously I cast down m:
burden, and sprang to his side. Bu

“How many have you shot?'
he asked me.

scene I draw a veil. The shriek
of my mother, who implore

ears. Since that time I have al

maker from morn to dawn. This is not the first time that our own
DRURIOLANUshas chosen the intermittent Lord Mayor (for did not Dick
pass the chair thrice P) as the subject for his annual. That he has
been wise in making the selection has been proved by the result. Sir!
her comic vocalism with a touch of sentiment that makes the whole
world kin after it has had its grin. Miss MARIE MONTROSE, too, is
winsome, and so are Misses AGNES HEwiTT, Eva WESTLAKE, and
MADGE LUCAs. In fact, the opening is well played by “all concerned.”
It is a wonder that, after the first innings of the morning perform-
ance, they should have scored so heavily in the evening's representa-
tion...But,5core they do, and are likely to “continue the move-
ment” until Easter.
The scenery must be seen. It baffles description. Who could
paint the sun ? Who could --
report the wonders of the
solar system P A first im-
pressionist would declare that
the gorgeous production of
colour, light, and form, could
only be adequately suggested
by the j “HARRIs.” So
the entire andience thought
on Boxing Night. Let it be
known that after the wonder-
ful “Feast of Lanterns”
Scene, Sir AUGUSTUs was called
and might have “gone on ”
indefinitely so far as the house
was concerned. Indeed, the
enthusiasm showed no sign of
diminution when the lessee had -
made his exit. Still the Gallery called for “’ARRis!' still the Stalls
expressed their opinion by the gentle tapping of well-gloved hands.
Nay more, there were members of the superior classes who not only
rapped out their applause, but roared with laughter. Frºm first
to last, thanks to a thoroughly appreciative (and yet discriminating)
audience, the play, went admirably: -
So the bells will ring for Whittington for a long time tº come.
And where the belles are there will be found the beaux. Tº cº-
tinue the association of ideas, the shot of Sir Augustus has ended in
a hit. It does not take a prophet to predict that Dick will not only
“Haul by the Sea.”
Augustus (with the assistance of his literary colleagues, Messrs. H.
HAMILTON and WALTER RALEIGH, and his chief of the staff, Mr.
ARTHUR Collins) has beaten his own record. Nothing better than
the present show has been seen at Drury Lane within the recollection
of the existing generation. And it is highly probable that the
memory of man does not, anent times past, run to the contrary.
The ex-sheriff has begun a new lease of the old house, and seem-
ingly has taken, the success he has so long established on the
premises as one of the fixtures. . A most excellent commencement tº
a * that should be highly satisfactory to both manager and
public.
So much for pantomimic things in general, and now to turn to
details in particular. The book of the words is decidedly a superior
article. Hitherto when the Drury Lane Annual has contained a
fault the mistake has been discovered in “the cackle.” On former
occasions it has been said (by the dyspeptic and consequently disap-
pointed) that “the turns of the halls” have been too numerous.
Those excellent comedians Messrs. DAN LENo and HERBERT CAMP-
bell have sometimes been a little too much in evidence to suit every
taste. In 1894-95 they have plenty to do, but only enough to satisfy
the most fastidious. They are quite as amusing as usual, and when
the curtain falls before “the transformation” people are rather in-
clined to ask for more than to say that they have had quite enough.
This is the token of a good sign. Then the Brothers,GRIFFITHs are
particularly pleasing: That member of the brethrºn who plays the eat
is at once comic and pathetic. He makes Malkin quite a loveable
character. Then Miss ADA BLANCHE, as Dick, is altogether a hero

TALV- TALES OF SPORT AND ADVENTURE.
(By Mr. Punch's own Short Story-teller.)
INTRODUCTION.
Not many living men, and even fewer in the ages that are past,
have—if I may use the word—sported with greater assiduity and
success than I have during a life which is even now little past its
middle period. . At one time on horseback, at another on the bound-
ing and impulsive elephant; now bestriding the matchless dromeda
on his native prairie, now posted on foot in a jungle crowded wit
golden pheasants in all the native splendour of their plumage; some-
times matching my solitary craft against a host of foxes on the swell-
ing uplands of Leicestershire, sometimes facing the Calydonian boar or
the .. panther in their woodland lairs, dealing showers of
leaden death from a hundred tubes, or tracking my fearful prey by
the lonely light of a wax vesta and
despatching it at midnight with
my trusty bowie —wherever there
were leagues to be walked, risks to
be run, or fastnesses to be rushed
there not only have I been the first,
but (paradoxical as it may appear)
there also have I succeeded and
have never been successfully fol-
lowed. My experiences are there-
fore unique, and it is in the hope
that they may to some extent profit
a younger generation, less inured,
I fear, to hardshi and danger than
my own, that I now set pen to
paper and recount some of the
exploits that have made my name
famous wherever sport is loved
and true sportsmen are revered.
A less modest man might have
said more, but one whose deeds
speak for him in every quarter of
the world may well be content to N
leave to punier men the ridiculous
trumpeting braggadocio that too
often makes so-called sportsmen
the laughing stock of society. For
myself, I can never forget the
lesson I learned at an early age
from my dear father, himself a
shikari of no common order, though ºf
to be sure, as he himself would -
the first to admit if he were alive,
the exploits of the son (I had no
brothers) have now thrust the
arental rformances into the
ackground. Still, it was my ºf
father who first inculcated upon
my infant mind the daring, the #3
ignorance of fear, the contempt of
danger, and the iron endurance
which have since made me a house-
hold word. Heaven rest the old
man!
Sand, with no head-stone to mark his resting-place, and neither
the roaring of his old enemies the tigers, nor the bellowing of the
countless alligators who infest the spot can rouse him any more.
Alas! it was trustfulness that destroyed him. He was gored to
death by a favourite rhinoceros that he had rescued at a tender age
when its mother was killed, and had brought up to know and, ..".
thought, to love him. But I have always thought myself that the
rhinoceros was a treacherous brute, and though I have often been
asked to tame one, for presentation to this or that Emperor, I have
consistently declined.
Marvellous, however, as my father was in his day for his exploits
and his variegated bags of game, he was perhaps even more wonder-
ful for the unswerving accuracy with which he was accustomed to
relate his adventures. Far and wide over the steppes of Central
Asia, the burning regions of equatorial Africa, the precipitous
haunts of the American Grizzly, and the wild retreats of the
ferocious Albanian pig-everywhere, in short, where he had set
foot or drawn trigger, this peculiarity of his was known and appreci-
ated, and many a respectful sobriquet did it earn for him from the
savage tribes amongst whom he spent the best years of his life. In
Kashmir he was known as Peili Tom, that is, the man who cannot lie;
amongst the swarthy Zambesians the name of Gorun Bettir (the Un-
defeated and Veracious Man) was a name to conjure with even when
in their moments of warlike passion the tribesmen rushed madly
through their primeval thickets, shouting their terrible war-cry,
“Itzup ures Leere,” that is, “Death to the white-faced robbers.”
But what I wished specially to relate about my poor father wa
the lesson of truthfulness which he inculcated upon me at an early
age. He and I (I was then but a lad of twelve) had been º
the ferocious Pilsener gemsbock through the wild Lagerland in whic
he makes his home. It happened one morning, that we, had parte,
company. To me was assigned the duty of beating through th
Bier-Wald, the dense forest which stretches mile upon mile in un
broken gloom to the confines of the Boose-See, e Fates wer
propitious. . Wherever I turned I saw a victim, and , one afte
another I brought down with unerring aim twenty-four (as .
thought) of these noble animals, whose horns are now worth a king'
ransom, and might, even in those distant days, have rescued
minor German Prince from captivity. Hastening home with m
booty loaded upon my back—I was a strong boy for my age, but o
course nothing to what I have since become—I met my dear fathe
“He had indeed seen ten bocks.”
He sleeps his last sleep far away in the Desert of Golden
just as I reached the door of the hut which served us for hunting
quarters. Joyously I cast down m
burden, and sprang to his side. Bu
my father wore an expression o
annoyance, and I soon discovere
that the luck had been against him
He had indeed seen ten bocks, bu

its accustomed deadliness, and h
had, come back empty-handed.

exorable.
“A lie,” he said, “is a lie. Yo

You must suffer.”
Over the rest of the painfu
scene I draw a veil. The shriek
of my mother, who implore

ears. Since that time I have al
ways respected not only the stric
truth, but also the leather thong
which are in use in the Lagerlan
for the droves of untameable cattl
that roam the prairies. This was my lesson, and I have nevel
never forgotten it.

A WINTER’S TALE.
Benevolent Person (recognising an old protégé). “Rogers, I'm sorry
to SEE. YoU IN THIS condition I I UNDERStood You HAD TAKEN
THE PLEDGE 1.”
Rogers. “You’RE QUI' RI’, SIR. ONLY Y’ see THE WATER 's

THAT PRECIOUS DONKEY!
(An Episode in the Life of A. Briefless, Junior, Esq., Barrister-at-Law,
in Three Parts.)
PART I.-The Coming into Possession of the Donkey.
“YES, Sir,” said my excellent and admirable clerk, PoETINGTON,
“he came here three times, about a month ago. We thought he was
mad, so would not let him in. But the third time he left that
parcel and that letter. You see, Sir, they are tied together, and as
there was a bomb scare on at the time, we did not touch them.
That’s how it comes, Sir, that you have not had them earlier.”
I must confess I was a little annoyed. I frequently absent myself
from Pump-Handle Court for days and even weeks together, and then
I expect my clerical (I use the adjective in its non-ecclesiastical
sense) representative to forward my correspondence.
“It cannot be helped, Porrington,” I replied; “all I care for are
the interests of my clients. If the visitor was one anxious to lay his
case, before me, I can only trust he has not suffered by my unpre-
meditated absence.”
“I do not think he will have to complain of that, Sir. And as to
his case, we don't know whether it is one; none of us like to touch
the º lest it should go off.”
“You mean with a report—it must get reported,” I suggested,
with a smile. I allow myself a little frolicsome levity at Yuletide.
“Well, where is it?”
“In your room, Sir,” and PoETINGTon led the way to my special
apartment.
I found my chamber tenanted by a miscellaneous collection of
articles. Truth to tell I do not use my rooms very frequently, and
consequently it has become a sort of a proverb ºf: my co-par-
ceners in Pump-Handle Court, d propos of anything of a cumbersome
character, “When in doubt, put it into BRIEFLEss's cupboard.”
on the word) is far more commodious than the largest specimen of
those receptacles. Consequently, I was not altogether surprised to
find collected together a banjo-case, some curtain rods, a number of
framed pictures, and a damaged bicycle. In the centre of the room
was an oblong parcel, to which was tied an envelope, doubtless con-
taining an enclosure.
With some slight trepidation—I had no wish to accompany. Pump-
Handle Court to the skies—I opened the letter. It ran as follows:–
“To A. BRIEFLESS, JUNIoR, Esq.-Dear and Honoured Sir, I have
. desired to show you some token of goodwill. I have frequently
read your contributions to the leading legal paper of the day (I refer,
of course, to the London Charivari), and have *... filled with admi-
ration at the clearness of your style and the depth of your knowledge
of what may be termed the duplex action of the human heart. As I
happen to be Emperor of CHINA I write anonymously. I have
been ruined by law and the lawyers. You have never represented
me or opposed me. For this I am very, very grateful, and beg you
. ...; the accompanying present. It is a- But hush, we are
observed.
And at this point the document abruptly terminated. I read the
letter to PoETINGTON, and asked his opinion upon it. He replied
*Nº. “considered the writer a lunatic.”
“Well, no, I do not think we can go quite so far as that,” I
observed.'" You see, he seems to have some appreciation of my
talents. He may be a trifle eccentric, but I fancy nothing worse.”
Encouraged by this belief in the sanity of my semi-anonymous (I
use the epithet advisedly, as I take it that the incidental claim to
the throne of the Celestial Empire was not urged seriously) corre-
spondent, I opened the package. The brown paper unwound and a
picture was revealed to us. It had evidently been painted for many
years. The frame (which, in PortINGToN's opinion, was the best
portion of the structure) was distinctly old-fashioned. The gilding
was tarnished and the woodwork out of repair.
“What is the subject?” I asked, after three or four minutes' close
inspection.
“I think, Sir,” replied my excellent and admirable clerk, “that
it’s something to do with a donkey.”
PoETINGTON was right. Oncloser investigation the painting revealed
itself to be the representation of a cottage in the snow, with some vil-
lagers drawing water from a half-frozen pond in the neighbourhood
of a rather intelligent donkey, who was watching their proceedings
with languid interest.
“Certainly it is a donkey,” I exclaimed; “and, to my thinking, a
very fine one.”
“What shall we do with it, Sir?” asked PoETINGTON. “It's no
good here; shall I give it to the dustman? He would take it away
if we asked him.”
For a moment I thought my clerical (I use the adjective in its non-
ecclesiastical sense) representative was indulging in jocularity. I
found I was in error. #. was absolutely serious.
“You evidently do not know the value of some of these old frames.
Of course I shall take the picture with me to my private residence.”
I carried out my intention. The canvas presentment of the donkey
and accessories was carefully conveyed in a four-wheeler to Justinian
Gardens, where I have rented for some years a very pleasant house.
The lady who has honoured me by taking my name, and whom in
my more playful humour I sportively term my “better seven-
eighths,” received me.
“I hope you have brought the music from the Stores,” said the
lady, after our first greetings. “I suppose that package came from
Wictoria Street?”
“No, my precious one,” I replied; I sometimes use terms of en-
dearment to the members of my. domestic circle. “It is a picture
given to me by a grateful client.”
“Client l” she exclaimed ; “and a grateful one ! What a
find l But why bring it here? Haven't we already more pictures
than we want? Why at this moment there's half-a-dozen of extra
plates from the Christmas numbers that you would have framed,
waiting to be hung.”
“But this, my love, is an oil-painting, with what I judge to be a
very valuable old-fashioned frame.”
By this time my present was revealed.
“Why, it’s on * picture of a donkey! ” exclaimed my better
seven-eighths, with a laugh. “We really don't want that sort of
thing in the hall or reception rooms.”
“But it is really very fine!” I urged. “Look at the handling
of that donkey's ears. And the frame, too, is simply magnificent.”
“I don't so much mind the frame. We might take out the picture
and put in ‘The Arrival of the Boulogne Boat,’ the Christmas

A WINTER’S TALE.
Benevolent Person (recognising an old protégé). “Rogers, I'm sorry

THAT PRECIOUS DONKEY!
(An Episode in the Life of A. Briefless, Junior, Esq., Barrister-at-Law,
in Three Parts.)
PART I.-The Coming into Possession of the Donkey.
“YES, Sir,” said my excellent and admirable clerk, PoETINGTON,
“he came here three times, about a month ago. We thought he was
mad, so would not let him in. But the third time he left that
parcel and that letter. You see, Sir, they are tied together, and as
There, was a bomb scare on at the time, we did not touch, them.
That’s how it comes, Sir, that you have not had them earlier.”
I must confess I was a little annoyed. I frequently absent myself
from Pump-Handle Court for days and even weeks together, and then
I expect my clerical (I use the adjective in its non-ecclesiastical
sense) representative to forward my correspondence.
“It cannot be helped, PorringtoN,” I replied; “all I care for are
the interests of my clients. If the visitor was one anxious to lay his
case before me, I can only trust he has not suffered by my unpre-
meditated absence.”
“I do not think he will have to complain of that, Sir... And as to
his case, we don't know whether it is one; none of us like to touch
the parcel, lest it should go off.”
“You mean with a report—it must get reported,” I suggested,
with a smile. I allow myself a little frolicsome levity at Yuletide.
“Well, where is it?”
“In your room, Sir,” and PoETINGTON led the way to my special
apartment.
I found my chamber tenanted by a miscellaneous collection of
articles. Truth to tell I do not use my rooms very frequently, and
consequently it has become a sort of a proverb .# my co-par-
ceners in Pump-Handle Court, d propos of anything of a cumbersome
character, “When in doubt, put it into BRIEFLEss's cupboard.”
on the word) is far more commodious than the largest specimen of
those receptacles. Consequently, I was not altogether surprised to
find collected together a banjo-case, some curtain rods, a number of
framed pictures, and a damaged bicycle. In the centre of the room
was an oblong parcel, to which was tied an envelope, doubtless con-
taining an enclosure.
With some slight trepidation—I had no wish to accompany, Pump-
Handle Court to the skies—I opened the letter. It ran as follows:–
“To A. BRIEFLEss, JUNIoR, Esq.-Dear and Honoured Sir, LI have
. desired to show you some token of goodwill. I have frequently
read your contributions to the leading legal paper of the day (I refer,
of course, to the London Charivari), and have been filled with admi-
ration at the clearness of your style and the depth of your knowledge
of what may be termed the duplex action of the human heart. As I
happen to be Emperor of CHINA I write anonymously. I have
been ruined by law and the lawyers. You have never represented
me or opposed me. For this I am very, very grateful, and beg you
. ...; the accompanying present. It is a- But hush, we are
OD86 rved.
And at this point the document abruptly terminated. I read the
letter to PoETINGTON, and asked his opinion upon it. He replied
*Nº. “considered the writer a lunatic.”
“Well, no, I do not think we can go quite so far as that,” I
observed. “You see, he seems to have some appreciation of my
talents. He may be a trifle eccentric, but I fancy nothing worse.”
Encouraged by this belief in the sanity of my semi-anonymous (I
use the epithet advisedly, as I take it that the incidental claim to
the throne of the Celestial Empire was not urged seriously) corre-
spondent, I opened the package. The brown paper unwound and a
picture was revealed to us. It had evidently been painted for many
years. The frame (which, in PortINGTON's opinion, was the best
portion of the structure) was distinctly old-fashioned. The gilding
was tarnished and the woodwork out of repair.
. “What is the subject?” I asked, after three or four minutes' close
inspection.
“I think, Sir,” replied my excellent and admirable clerk, “that
it’s something to do with a donkey.”
... PortINGTON was right. Qncloser investigation the painting revealed
itself to be the representation of a cottage in the snow, with some vil-
lagers drawing water from a half-frozen pond in the neighbourhood
of a rather intelligent donkey, who was watching their proceedings
with languid interest.
“Certainly it is a donkey,” I exclaimed; “and, to my thinking, a
very fine one.”
“What shall we do with it. Sir?” asked PortINGTON. “It's no
good here; shall, I give it to the dustman? He would take it away
if we asked him.”
For a moment I thought my clerical (I use the adjective in its non-
ecclesiastical sense) representative was indulging in jocularity. I
found I was in error. PortINGTON was absolutely serious.
“You evidently do not know the value of some of these old frames.
Of course I shall take the picture with me to my private residence.”
I carried out my intention. The canvas presentment of the donkey
and accessories was carefully conveyed in a four-wheeler to Justinian
Gardens, where I have rented for some years a very pleasant house.
The lady who has honoured me by taking my name, and whom in
my more playful humour I sportively term my “better seven-
eighths,” received me. -
“I hope you have brought the music from the Stores,” said the
lady, after our first greetings. “I suppose that package came from
Wictoria Street?”
“No, my precious one,” I replied; I sometimes use terms of en-
dearment to the members of my domestic circle. “It is a picture
given to me by a grateful client.”
“Client l” she exclaimed ; “and a grateful one ! What a
find l But why bring it here? Haven't we already more pictures
than we want? Why at this moment there's half-a-dozen of extra
plates from the Christmas numbers that you would have framed,
waiting to be hung.”
“But this, my love, is an oil-painting, with what I judge to be a
very valuable old-fashioned frame.”
By this time my present was revealed.
“Why, it’s on * picture of a donkey!” exclaimed my better
seven-eighths, with a laugh. “We really don't want that sort of
thing in the hall or reception rooms.”
“But it is really very fine!” I urged. “Look at the handling
of that donkey's ears. K. the frame, too, is simply magnificent.”
“I don't so much mind the frame. We might take out the picture
and put in “The Arrival of the Boulogne Boat,’ the Christmas
supplement to the Young Lady's Boudoir, in its stead. And yet it
is just as likely as not to spoil it. No, I think we had better put
picture and frame in the box-room.”
“But my dear,” I remonstrated; “this may be a very valuable
picture. The head of the donkey is quite remarkable and—”

throughout that period had many
opportunities of seeing places, and,
more precious, of meeting people.
|To the study of both he brings
keen sight, a good memory, and a
genuine, not too obtrusive, sense
of humour. Born in Hamburg in
1819, he has sojourned in most of
the capitals of Europe, perma-

and life in London. He seems to
have known most of the notable
ersonages of the middle and
atter half of the century. His
wide uaintance with royalty

TO JULIA’S POCKET.
[The ideal lady's pocket, that shall at once be
accessible to its owner and defy the footpad's art,
has yet to be invented.—Wears of Tautologus.]
My JULIA's chaste and winsome cheer."
Her comely lip, her coral ear,
And eke her knickerbocker, gear, "
These be the theme of rhyming folk,
Whereof the skill I here invoke.
In malediction of her poke;
In that it passeth human wit
By º of hand withal to hit
Upon the pathless track of it.
Though JULIA's self therein dispose
That napkin with the which she blows
For sorry rheum her Greekish nose,
Not if she search with heavy pain
Shall she by taking thought attain
To look upon the thing again;
To him alone of mortal clay
That picketh pokes beside the way
Their deeps are open as the day."
Whenas her alms she would disburse,
In vain she probeth for her purse,
Whereat the beggars shrewdly curse;
Even so their teeth do felons gnash
That lightly lift her ready cash,
Which he that stealeth stealeth trash.
Oft-times she doth full bravely hold
Her breezy reticule of gold
Within her digits' dainty fold;
As certain maids, I well believe,
Do wear th’ affections on their sleeve
For any worthless wight to reave.
But though her purse not suffer rape,
Mischance is like in other shape
To put on her a saucyjape;—
If so my lady at the mart
For very joyaunce of her heart
Do purchase her a pasty-tart,
Let her not make essay to bring
So beauteous and frail a thing
Within her poke's encompassing;
Lest, sitting down with weary stress,
Unheedful of its buxomness,
She make a right unseemly mess!
Certes a man purblind may see
For these offences needs must be
Some comfortable remedy;
Whoso deviseth such an one,
I trow that his invention
Shall soothly pouch the peerless bun.
NOTICES TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Perplered.—You are entirely in error in
supposing that the member for ºlº, Yorks
has, in , accepting a baronetcy, escended
from a higher estate. You have been deceived
by similarity of sound. The hon. member
was not of the same rank as a statesman (who
we observe has just repaired to his country
seat at Pinley Park, where he will entertain
His Serene Highness the Duc de Seidlitz-
PoupRE) to whom Sir Robert PEEL used to
allude in the House of Commons as “the
noble Baron.” In becoming Sir John BAR-
RAN, Bart., the member for Otley gains a dis-
tinct step in the social ladder.
Blind, Deaf, and Dumb.-We are pleased
to be able to reassure you. The fact that you

OWERHEARD FRAGMENT OF A DIALOGUE
Lord Illingworth. My dear GoRING, I assure you that a well-tied
tie is the first serious step in life. -
Lord Goring." My dear ILLINGworTH, five well-made button-holes
a day are far more essential. They please women,
and women rule society.
Lord Illingworth. understood you considered
women of no importance?
Lord Goring. My dear GEORGE, a man's life re-
volves on curves of intellect. It is on the hard lines
of the emotions that a woman's life progresses. . Both
revolve in cycles of masterpieces. They should re-
volve on bi-cycles; built, if possible, for two. But
I am keeping you?
Lord Illingworth. I wish you were. Nowadays it is
only the poor who are kept at the expense of the rich.
Lord Goring. Yes. It is perfectly comic, the
number of young men going about the world nowa-
davs who adopt perfect j. as a useful profession.
Lord Illingworth. Surely that must be the next
- world? How about the Chiltern Thousands P
“Full of good Lord º: Don’t. GEORGE. Have you seen
things!” WINDERMERE lately? Dear WINDERMERE! I should
... like to be exactly unlike WINDERMERE.
. I ord Illingworth. Poor WINDERMERE! He spends his mornings
in doing what is possible, and his evenings in saying what is probable.
By the way, do you really understand all I say?
Lord Goring. Yes, when I don't listen attentively.
Lord Illingworth. Reach me the matches, like a good boy—thanks.
Now-define these cigarettes—as tobacco.
Lord Goring...My dear GeoRGE, they are atrocious. And they
leave me unsatisfied.
Lord Illingworth, You are a promising disciple of mine. The
only use of a disciple is that at the moment of one's triumph he
stands behind one's chair and shouts that after all he is immortal.
Lord Goring. You are quite right. It is as well, too, to remember
from time to time that º, that is worth knowing can be learnt.
Lord Illingworth. Certainly, and ugliness is the roof of all industry.
. Lord Goring. George, your conversation is delightful, but your
views are terribly unsound. You are always saying insincere things.
Lord Illingworth. If one tells the truth, one is sure sooner or later
to be found out.
Lord Goring. Perhaps. The sky islike a hard hollow sapphire. It
is too late to sleep. I shall go down to Covent Garden and look at the
roses. Good-night, GeoRGE | I have had such a pleasant evening !
DEATH IN THE CUP.
[“The social duty of paying calls, refreshed, as it necessarily is, by frequent
cups of tepid tea, is apparently little better than a process of slow poison-
ing.”—Daily Graphic.]
OH, here's a pretty state of things! Whenever you go calling,
And take this deadly liquor and imbibe it without stint,
You're certainly preparing a -
catastrophe appalling, ** *
Your mirth is as the little 2% Nº
ºf-SNAE
%atº
lamb's, unmindful of the
mint.
And when your entertainer, who
seems so sweetly placid
And quite unlike a. criminal,
suggests “Another cup?'
She might as well be offering a
ose of prussic acid,
And the Public Prosecutor |
*/º
ought to take the matter s \ º
up ! tº /º
“The cup that cheers.”—that
hackneyed , phrase is
frightfully in error,
If seldom it “inebriates” (it does, the doctors plead),
There lurks within its fatal draught a more efficient terror,
'Twill shortly make a funeral your one and only need!
“A word to you, Amanda mine!”
So since a daily cup or two the thin end of the wedge is,
And since this revelation of our danger has been made,
We all will wear red ribbons and will sign the strictest pledges,
And speedily inaugurate an “Anti-Tea” crusade.
A word to you, AMANDA mine. Unless your cruel kindness,
Your efforts to consign me to an early grave, shall cease,
And if you dare, presuming on my long-continued blindness,
To offer me a cup of tea—I’ll send for the police!
THE TIME of DAY.-Good, after NEwNEs to find the style
“Bart.” The bestowal of the baronetcy quite a Tit-Bit for the
Strand. But there is no truth in the report that the event will be
followed by the establishment of a new morning paper to be called
The Dragon, and edited by Sir GEORGE.
THE CHRONICLES OF A RURAL PARISH.
IX. —OF CoAL.
THE County Council has solved the great Mud-
ford mystery by deciding in favour of Mrs. ARBLE
MARCH, who is in the seventh heaven at bein
the Seventh Councillor. A wise Legislature j
it in contemplation that possibly when the great
measure came to be º it might not be found
to act, however much you pulled the string, and
it was accordingly left to the County Council, to
set on its legs any poor little Parish Council which
might have been brought into the world without
its full number of members. Thus it came about
that Mrs. MARCH got elected. The actual cir-
cumstances of her election gave rise to some com-
ment. She was proposed by the Primrose League
Ruling Councillor of one adjoining parish, and
seconded by the Knight Harbinger of another.
Our County Council is a strongly Tory body, and
she was easily elected. There was a great outcr
against this, as an act of political partisanship. It
was. But when it became known that Mrs.
LETHAM HAVITT's friends and supporters were all
avowed Radicals, popular indignation seemed
suddenly to flicker out.
It may be, however, that the indignation only
transferred itself to me, for I myself have got, in
a most extraordinary and unexpected fashion, into
a great hobble. It arose in this way. , Having
been elected on to the Parish Council at the top
of the poll, and having, moreover, been subse-
quently the recipient of innumerable congratu-
lations from my fellow-parishioners, I not unna-
SYMPATHY WANTEL)—
For the Man whose Collar comes
turally—so I still venture to think—desired in undone every time he tries to do up
treatment I had received. I accordingly deter-
mined to make to every elector a present of coals,
and to carry out that intention issued the following
circular:-
To the Electors of Mudford.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, -For your kindness
in electing me at the top of the poll, I can find no
terms sufficiently warm to express myself. In
commemoration of the great occasion, and as a
small thankoffering for my return, I beg your
acceptance of the enclosed Coal Ticket, which will
entitle you to 2 cwt. of coal from any of the village
coal dealers.
Your obliged and obedient servant,
TIMOTHY WINKINs.
I sent this to every elector, high or low, rich or
poor. I hardly imagined that the Squire would
want coal, but he was a constituent of mine, and
he had his ticket. What has been the result of
my generosity ? This. Whilst almost every coal-
ticket has been used, I am denounced right and
left in unmeasured terms as an unscrupulous
briber. Miss PHILL BURTT (who, as might be
expected, has been most kind and sympathetic
about the whole thing), tells me that even the
Squire said it was a very ingenious way of wishing
myself Many Happy Returns to the Parish Council.
A poor joke, I think, but an undeniably excellent
sneer. BLAck Bob is, as might be expected,
much more plain and direct in his denunciation.
He says, that if I stand for re-election—in April,
1896 —this ought to be enough to unseat me. A
leasant prospect. I can do nothing. My boats,
ke my coal, are burnt. -
What happened at the Parish Council meeting







some way to show my appreciation of the kind his Tie.
last night I must leave-till my next.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TALL TALES OF SPORT AND ADVENTURE.
(By Mr. Punch's own Short Story-teller.)
I.—THE PINK HIPPOPOTAMU.S.
THE island of Seringapatam is without exaggeration one of the
fairest jewels in the imperial diadem of our world-wide possessions.
Embosomed in the blue and sparkling wavelets of the Pacific Ocean,
breathed upon by the spicy breezes that waſt their intoxicating }:
fumes through endless groves of gigantic acacias, feathery fern
trees, and gorgeously coloured Indian acanthoids; studded with the
glittering domes of a profusion of jasper palaces beside which the
trumpery splendours of Windsor or Versailles are but as dust, and
guarded by the loyal devotion of an ancient warrior race noted not
less for the supreme beauty of its women than for the matchless
courage and endurance of its men, the Kingdom of Seringapatam
offered during a period of more than one hundred years a stubborn
resistance even to the arms of the all-conquering Britons. So great
indeed, was the respect extorted
from the victors by the vanquished
that when, owing to the marvel-
lous strategy of my old friend
Major-General Sir BonAMY BAT-
TLeHoRN, K.C.B., K.C.M.G., the
island was finally subdued, it was
agreed that in all but their ac-
knowledgment of a British Suze-
rainty and the payment of an
annual tribute of fifteen hundred
gold lakhs, the proud islanders
were to maintain their independ-
ence and to continue those forms
of government which long tradi-
tion had invested in their eyes
with all the sanctity of a religion.
I had been present with my
dear father at the great battle of
the Dead Marshes by which the
fortunes of the islanders were
finally shattered. Never shall I
forget the glow of exultant grati- ||
tude with which towards the end
of the day gallant old Sir BoxAMY
came cantering towards me on his
elephant. “Thank you, thank
you a thousand times, my dear
ORLANDo,” said the glorious vete-
ran as he approached me; “it
was that last change of yours at
the head of your magnificent
Thundershakers that has con-
verted defeat into victory, and
assured Westminster Abbey to the
bones of BONAMY BATTLEHoRN.
All that is now necessary,” he con-
tinued, rising in his stirrups and waving his sword, “is that }.
should complete the work that you have begun. Dost see that
battery of fifty guns still served by the haº; remnants of the
Seringapatamese bombardiers? Let them be captured, and nothing
will stand between us and the Diamond City of the Ranee.”
I needed no further incitement. Gathering round me the few
Thundershakers who had escaped unscathed, I bade the standard-
bearer unfurl the flag of the brigade. In another moment we were
upon them. Cutting, slashing, piercing, parrying, trampling,
crushing, we dashed into the midst of the foe.
Far over the field of
carnage sounded our war-cry, the famous “Higher up Bayswater!’
which was to our horses as the prick of spur. In vain the doughty
bombardiers belaboured us; in vain did they answer with the awful
shout of “Benkcitibenk,” which none hitherto had been able tº
withstand. The work was hot, but in less than three minutes the
battery was ours, and the broken host of the Ranee was streaming
in full flight down the slopes from which so lately they had dealt
death amongst the English army. In another moment we h
limbered up-two men to each gun, except the largest, which was
assigned to me as the chief of the band—and helter skelter down the
hill we went, and so, with shouting and with laughter, deposited
our spoils at the feet of the British General.
I do not recount this incident in order to magnify my own exploits.
My deeds themselves are my best record, those deeds which a
factious majority in successive Parliaments has, to its everlast-
ing shame, refused to recognise, but which not even the voice of
malice, always busy in the task of depreciating genuine achieve-
ment, can rob of one particle of their brilliant and immortal lustre.
“Fair and full I caught him.”
was through him that I gained the knowledge which prompted the
adventure I am now about to relate.
(To be continued.)
momentarily separated from the main body of my men. Seizing
the opportunity, and noticing, too, that in the previous melée I had
been unhorsed, two gigantic artillerymen made at me. My sword
was broken, my revolver was empty What was I to do? But
little time for reflection was left to me. With savage shouts the two
dusky Titans sprang upon me... I gave myself up for lost, shut my
eyes, thought of my poor mother, saw in a flash my happy country
home, the thatched roofs of the cottages, the grey old church, the
babbling stream, the village school, the little shop where my infant
mouth had first become acquainted with the succulent bull's-eye—in
short, I went through the symptoms that are understood to
accompany the imminence of a violent death. Suddenly, however
the desire to live awoke once more. The smaller of my two foes had
outstripped his companion. He was just about to seize me, when,
lowering my head, which was encased in a spiked helmet, I bounded
at him. Fair and full I caught him, and so terrific was the force
engendered by my spring and the foeman's rush, that not the spike
alone, but the helmet and the hº ºiered him through and
rough.
Down on his back he fell crash-
ing, bearing me with him as he
went over and fixing the spike
firmly in the earth, pinned like
some huge beetle by a human pin.
As my legs flew up they encoun-
tered the second giant, and,
winding round his chest, crushed
every vestige of life out of him
and flung his mangled body full
twenty yards to the rear. I had
escaped, but my position was still
uncomfortably awkward. By this
time, however, the rout was com-
plete, and four of my men, by
dint of tremendous exertions, suc-
ceeded in extricating me from my
curious entanglement. My pinned
foeman turned out to be the
Ranee's brother, HADJU THAR
MEEBHoy. We bore him back
with us to camp, where, marvel-
lous to relate, after a prolonged
illness, he eventually recovered.
Of course he has never been
quite the same man since. He
has to be careful about his diet,
but with the childlike simplicity
of an Ori, ntal he finds a constant
pleasure in opening and shutting
the little aluminium doors which
our dear old surgeon, Toby
Q'GRADY, constructed to replace
the KHAN's stomach and the
small of his back. I came to be
great friends with him, and it
A WORD ABOUT THE ST. HENRY JAMES’S THEATRE.
THERE is something in a name, especially when it happens to be
the title of a play. At the St. James's, Mr. ALEXANIFR's latest
venture has been Guy Domville, by the American novelist HENRY
JAMEs, who if he knew as much about play-writing as he does about
novel-writing would probably be in the first flight of dramatists;
and he would not have chosen so hopeless a name for his hero and for
his play as Guy Domville. For the anti-James jokers would º:
in finding that Guy could be “guy'd,” and to say as to “Lomrille.”
that “a first night audience ‘rill dom” the play.” For all that, if
ALEXANDER be the sagacious commander in the dramatic field that he
has hitherto shown himself, it is not likely that he should have been
completely mistaken in accepting a play which a portion of the public
has refused to accept. Of course, a manager cannot afford to keep a
play going until the public come en masse to see it, and therefore
unless there is “a turn of the tide” (and such things have happen
before now, and a condemned piece, has had a long and prosperous
career), Mr. ALExANDER will himself be obliged to do to the play what
those who ridicule and chaff it have already done, i.e. “take it off.”
MRs. R. admits that she has always been vely fond of sweets at
What she is especially fond of is, she says, “a dish of

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
COUNTER-IRRITATION.
A STUDY AT A WINTER SALE.
THAT PRECIOUS DONKEY |
(An Episode in the Life of A. Briefless, Junior, Esq., Barrister-at-Law,
in Three Parts.)
PART II. —The Passing of the Picture.
It may be remembered that the gift of my grateful if eccentric
client had been put in the box-room at Justinian Gardens. There
the presentment of the donkey languidly ...” villagers
reposed, amidst the possibly congenial surroundings of broken
perambulators, superannuated folding-dors, and half-forgotten
wide-awake hats. "I rather regretted the fate of the picture, as it
seemed to me that it might have served as a not invaluable adver-
tisement... As a large proportion of the forensic world knows, I not
infrequently during the Yuletide season entertain some of my friends
at the Bar, and I should have been pleased to have been able to point
to the canvas as a sort of testimonial. However, the painting had
disappeared, and there was nothing more to be said about it.
I am reminded by this reference to my vacation entertainments,
that it was at one of “these feasts of reason and flows of soul” (as
my learned and distinguished friend Appleblossom, QC., is kind
enough to call then) that my fortunes underwent a change for the
better. The inhabitants of Justinian Gardens are accustomed to do
things very well. When there is a ball, the number of vehicles
(always with one horse apiece, and sometimes with a pair) is quite
considerable. On such occasions a stranger might imagine that the
Gardens had the advantage of a chronic cab-stand. At 97 (which
I think I may describe as our show-house) there is a butler, and
there are few at Justinian Gardens who cannot boast of a “buttons.”
I do not secure the services of a man-retainer myself, and am con-
sequently not quite in the fashion. However, when I entertain, I
do my best to be worthy of the prestige of my neighbours, and put
forth all my strength in making my house an object of interest.
The walls of my modest dwelling-place are adorned with several
mementoes of my not- altogether-common-place career. For
instance, I have had my commission as a Lieutenant of Wolunteers
| (I served for many years in the Bishop's Own, and was iously
framed, and have treated the pasteboard distinctions.I. won at
school in a similar fashion. When I purpose entertaining my
friends at the Bar, I have these gratifying landmarks in my
life's history polished up by an individual known in my house-
hold as “the handy man.” This person (towards whom I enter-
tain a friendly regard), for a certain sum an hour undertakes to
do anything I require. I believe that he can paint a house,
build a conservatory, cut down a forest, and reconstruct an
aquarium with equal facility. But it is only right to say that
I make this statement on the faith of his guarantor—the gentle-
man who was good enough to procure for me the advantage of
his services—and cannot speak from personal knowledge...So
far I have only had the opportunity of testing his capabilities
in window-cleaning and the dusting of works of art. In per-
forming these domestic duties he shows great energy, and even
daring. He seems to delight in standing on window-ledges
and the outer edges of flights of stairs. have been given to
understand that he glories in these displays of hardihood, as
they remind him of the days and nights when he acted as a
rather prominent member of the Fire Brigade.
“Mr. WILKINs,” I said, on my departure for the Temple,
“I shall esteem it a favour if you will be so good as to
employ your leisure to-day in repainting the waterbutts, sweep-
ing the kitchen chimney, putting glass in the conservatory,
regilding the mirror in the study, and, if you have time, dust-
ing my testimonial.”
“Certainly, Sir,” replied my valued acquaintance, and before
I had closed the hall door, the sounds of the rumbling sticks
told me that he had already commenced to remove the super-
fluous soot from the culinary smoke-hole.
I had rather an arduous day at Pump-Handle Court. I had
quite an accumulation of circulars, and a consent brief that
required very careful attention. The latter was not endorsed
with my name, but I saw to it on behalf of a colleague. After
I had spent some hours in the little frequented (during the
vacation) realms of the Temple, I returned to Justinian Gardens,
which I need scarcely tell an experienced cabman is in the
neighbourhood of that º rising locality—Earl's Court.
The door was opened by Mr. WILKINs in person, who antici-
pated the turning of the proprietorial latch-key.
“I am sorry to say, Sir.” said my trusted employé, “that I
have had an accident. While I was dusting the military en-
listment card—”
“You mean my commission?”
“I do, Sir. It came down with a run. You see, Sir, you
have had him rather heavily framed. Unfortunately, Sir,
when I passed the polish brush over him the nail did not hold,
and it gave suddenly. The picture made a nasty mark on the
wall, and smashed up when he got to the flooring. I would have
reframed him, but all the shops close early on a Thursday, and I can
get no glass.”
“Well, what have you done?” I asked, in a tone of some annoy-
ance, for I pride myself on my commission, and am proud of showing
it to my friends.
“Well, Sir, I went up to the box-room to see if I could find any:
thing that would do, and have looked up an affair that I think will
meet with your approval.”
By this time I had reached the place where the wall was damaged.
The spot was covered by a picture,
“I did my best, Sir. Iwashed the canvas with soap and water,
and put the polishing brush over the frame. Of course the subject
ain't worth much, but for a stop-gap it isn't bad. Now is it?”
I then found that Mr. Wilkins had hidden the faulty hall paper
with the picture that had been presented to me by the gentleman
who had raised a claim to the throne of the Celestial Empire.
Secretly pleased that I could now have an º of referring
to the gratitude of my client to my learned and distinguished friend,
APPLEBLossom, Q.C., who had promised to dine with me that evening,
I readily accepted the apologies of the penitent WILKINs.
“I will put it allright to-morrow, Sir,” said my distressed
employé., “I will get some glass, fix up your ºnlistment, card, and
have it done before I rebuild the pantry and whitewash the ceiling
of the bath-room.”
Satisfied with the promise I thought no more of the contretemps
until after dinner, when my attention was directed to it by APPLE-
Blossom, Q.C., who had made himself vastly agreeable after the
ladies had retired and left us to discuss the chestnuts and the port.
“Hullo, BRIEFLEss,” he exclaimed; “where did you get that Old
Boots?”
I told my story of the grateful client, and young BANDs, who I
fancy is thinking of reading in my chambers, regarded me (I venture
to believe) with increased respect.
“Bless me, you have a treasure!” continued APPLEbossom, Q.C.,
who seemed wrapt in admiration. “That is a genuine Old Boots.
You can always tell him from Young. Boots by the manipulation of

int a donkey like that? By Jove, BRIEFLEss, you are in luck!
ou ought to make a fortune out of it at CHRISTIEs l’”
“Why, is it very valuable?” I asked. “I am not much of an
§: connoisseur, and I frankly confess I know very little of Old
HOES.
“Old Boots, Sir!” cried APPLEBLossom, Q.C. “Why I thought
all the world knew Old Boots! One of the grandest painters of the
eighteenth century! He got that particular delicacy of touch which
you can trace in that donkey's ears by never commencing to paint
his animals until he was recovering from delirium tremens. Why,
Sir, that animal is simply superb. Look at his mane, Sir! Why, it
is simply marvellous!’
I did look at the donkey's ears and mane, and, with the assistance
of young BANDs, went into an ecstasy. The ears of the animal were
certainly magnificent.
I must admit I was excited during the rest of that eventful even-
ing. I determined to keep the secret of my good fortune to myself.
I thought I would surprise the lady who does me the honour to bear
my name, by telling her that I had become a rich man after I had
cashed the cheque I was sure to receive. All the following day I
made plans for the spending of my fortune. I would have a box in
the Highlands, a pied-d-terre in Paris, and a pyramid in Egypt. I
would present my Inn with a massive gold snuff-box, .# Port-
TINGTON should have a silver-mounted meerschaum. If my age did
not bar my progress, I would seek service in the Militia—as a lieu-
tenant-colonel. There was no limit to my ambition,
When I returned, Mr. WILKINs (who is thoroughly conscientious),
having finished the rebuilding of the pantry and the whitewashing
of the bath-room, had departed. He does not waste his time, and
only charges me for the hours he actually expends in honest labour.
I hurried to the spot where my Old Boots was temporarily resting
before removal to the far-famed auction-rooms in King Street,
St. James's. I turned pale.
“Why, what is this?” I asked, trembling with emotion.
“Your commission, dear,” said my better seven-eighths. “It
looks better than the picture, although I must say the donkey im-
proves on acquaintance. . It really was very well painted. airl
quite sorry Mr. WILKINs has taken it away.”
“WILKINs taken it away?” I gasped out.
“Yes. . He said that you didn't seem to care for it, so he went off
to trv and sell it.”
“Why l’” I exclaimed, and my voice, through my deep emotion,
drºpped almost to a whisper, “it is an Old Boots!”
“An Old Boots!” cried my better seven-eights, becoming as
excited as myself. “Why, our fortunes are made! An Old Boots!
Oh, why didn't you tell me! An Old Boots! Fancy having an
Öid Boörjº
“But we haven't,” I returned, almost in tears. “The handy-man
has gone off with it! What are we to do without our Old Boots!”
“We will get it back!” returned my better and more important
fraction, with determination.
whether we did recover our lost treasure, or fail in the .
must, owing to the exigencies of space (so I am given to understand),
form the subject of another and concluding contribution. The chase
after, our Old Boots was not without adventures of a distinctly
exciting character.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
IT is noteworthy how in recent years, in the matter of fiction, the
star of Empire shineth in the North. After WALTER Scott estab-
lished the sovereignty of Scotland in fºL-
the world of British fiction, there ºilº
was a long pause. In our generation
WILLIAM BLACK came to the front.
Later, we have had STEVENson,
BARRIE, and CRoCKETT. Now here is
IAN MACLAREN with his cluster of
gem-like stories gathered Beside the
Bonnie Briar Bush (Hodder AND
StoughTon). My Baronite tells me
that of the collection Mr. GLADSTonE
likes best “A Doctor of the Old
School.” Where all is good it is diffi-
cult to establish supremacy. But for
simple pathos and for the skill of
drawing with a few touches living -
figures of flesh and blood, this sketch 4, -
is certainly hard to beat. Yet “A -
Lad of Pairts” runs it close. A very beautiful book, full of human
nature in its simplest form and most pathetic circumstances.
Says the Baron, “What I who have read Mr. BRAM STOKER's latest
romance could tell you about The Watter's Mou' would make your
mou’ watter with longing desire to devour it... It is excellent: first
because it is short; secondly, because the excitement is kept up from
first page to last; and, thirdly, because it is admirably written
throughout; the scenic descriptive portion being as entrancing as the
dramatic, it is brought out in the Acme Series in charge of A
Constable, and its full price is only one shilling.”
A good short story is to be found in A Clear Case of the Super-
natural, by REGINALD Lucas, only as it is by no, means “a clear
case,” it might have been appropriately entitled, Fluke or Spook.

bably see something beautiful. Italy, cradle of the arts, and all that
sort ºf thing. Besides, so nice to say to Jon Es, “My dear fellow,
here's a little trifle; got it in Milan, you know. It’s modern, but
then the Italians are always so artistic.” To exhibition. Why,
there are pictures here ! Of course, just suit me. Hurry to picture
gallery. Several rooms. Enter eagerly. After a short time, totter
feebly out and ask the official at the door where 1 can obtain a little
brandy. He, evidently alarmed by my horror-stricken face and
staggering movements, asks civilly if I am ill. Would I like a
chair? Should he fetch a doctor? Thank him, and say it is nothing
serious. I have only been looking at a few modern Italian pictures.
Crawl to the refreshment bar, and am revived with cognac. Then
inspect the rest of the exhibition. Am the only visitor, which is not
surprising, for there is nothing to see but bottles! An exhibition of
bottles! They are said to be full of wine, but I do not see how that
males them more beautiful. Absurd to buy Jon Es some bottles.
And equally absurd to buy him some Italian wine when he can get
good French wine in England. Besides, can't carry bottles in my
Gladstone bag. Therefore, give up Milan.
Venice.—The chief manufactures here are lace and glass. Now

give up Venice.
Bologna.-More useless local productions! Here they make sau-
sages and soap. Jon Es is not a starving scarecrow for want of
sausages, nor a SIMEON STYLITEs for want of soap. Must therefore
give . Bologna. This wedding present begins to weigh me down.
At each new place it obtrudes itself between me an all the beautiful
things I look at. Must really get something in Florence.
Florence.—Great Scott! It's worse here. A life-size marble
statue, or a mosaic table weighing nearly a ton. Have serious
thoughts of buying, at a great ... an extra large statue,
hitherto unsaleable on account of its size, and then telling Jones
that his wedding present is waiting for him here, if he will come
and fetch it. The dealer asks 2,000 lire. I understand shopping in
Italy. Early one morning offer him 50. He at once comes down to
1,000. I go up to 100. Discuss for one hour, haggle for another
hour, dispute angrily for a third. Then go off to déjeuner. Closing
prices—dealer 725, myself 250. Back again after interval for
refreshment. Begin quietly. Opening prices—dealer 720, myself
251. Discussion, haggling, dispute as before. Indignant marchings
out by me, frantic pursuits by the dealer. Final prices—dealer
403, myself 396. Each of us, hoarse and exhausted, refuses to yield
another centesimo. So do not buy statue for Jones, and give up
Florence. Genoa is the last chance.
Genoa.-Velvet? What's the good of velvet to Jones?, Besides
it is fabulously dear, something like attar of roses at so much a drop.
Must give up even Genoa.
London.—Back again. Have bought a biscuit box and sent it to
Jones. Since then have met Jones's cousin, and SMITH, and Jones's
brother-in-law, and Mrs. Robinson, and a few other mutual friends.
We disagree in many things, but in one we seem to be unanimous.



Jones never wears any lace, except in his boots, and never wears any
We have all given him biscuit boxes!

embrace this opportunity of securing a woman

not to say hopeless. After she had sat down,
there was an ominous pause. At length Irose
and proposed myself. In impressive tones I

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE COMYNS AND THE GOIN'S OF ARTHUR.
It was a pleasant sight, on the première of King Arthur, to see
Mr. CoMYNs CARR, t, littérateur, art-critic, theatrical manager,
orator, journalist, dramatist, and not a few other things beside;
gravely bowing his acknowledgments as “the Arthur of the piece”
at the Lyceum. Beshrew me, and by my halidome, he hath done his
work with so deft and cunning a hand as to puzzle not a little those
who have their GoFTHE, their TENNYson, and some of the most
favourite plays of WILLIAM SHARspEARE at their fingers' ends, and
who are also more.orlless acquainted with Wagnerianitrilogies.
Weallknow “KETTLE
began it.” Well, WAG-
NER begins this, in the
Prologue, with spirits
and water, i.e., mere
spirits getting along
º in a kind
of Niebelungen lake-
and-cavern scene. Not
until the curtain rose
was any sort of atten-
tion paid to the music,
which might have
therefore been the com-
position of NoAREs
or StoREs, instead of
having been exquisitely
written by King AR-
THUR SULLIVAN.
Enter King Arthur
Irving and Merlin
(“Charles his friend”),
suggestive of Macbeth
and Banquo, to see Wag-
nerian , water-witches
in The Colleen Bawn's
cave, Wagnerian water-
witches, disturbed by
the approach of gentle-
men, swim away to re-
gain, presumably, their
bathing-machines.
Then Charles-his-friend
Merlin undertakes the
part of a kind of half-
converted Mephisto-
pheles, and shows the
Faust-King-Arthur a
“ living picture” of
Guinevere as Margue-
rite in a vision. After
this up comes a hand
out of the water, bear-
ing a magnificently
jewelled scabbard, in N
which, of course, is that
blade of the very first
water, “Ercalibur.”
Arthur accepts the
sword with thanks, ob-
serving that “if neces-
sary he will use it to
make any cuts the piece
may require.” ore
chorus of water-sprites,
and end of prologue.
Merlin, or a spirit,
ought to have sung “Voici le sabre.” This chance was lost.
he next scene is at Camelot, when in come a lot of knights in
armour, and the story begins in real earnest. Here is ELLEN TERRY
sweet and majestic as the Burne-Jonesian Queen Guinevere, and
here, too, is FokBEs-Robertson as Lancelot, a part which he plays
and looks to perfection. The order has been given “All wigs abandon
ye who enter here,” that is as far as the male ºf are con-
cerned; so, they aii “keep their hair on,” and thus HENRY IRVING
in armour looks more like the “Knight of the Woeful Countenance,”
or a moustachioless Don Quirote, than the glorious Chairman of the
Goodly Round Table Company.
Sir Lancelot is ...i. by “circumstances over which he has
no control” to remain behind at court, all through the selfishness of
King Arthur (so unlike him, too, for once!), who fancies the Round
Table will be a trifle dull when all his “blooming companions have
faded ald gone,” and so the unfortunate young knight has to say to
the Queen, as Mr. CHEvaLIER's Coster sings to his “lidy-love,”
“I’m bound to keep on lovin' yer! d'yer'ear?” and he is watched

by Macbeth-Mordred (Mr. FRANK CoopFR) and his be-witching
mother Lady Macbeth-Morgan-le-Fay (Miss GENEVIEve WARD).
In Act Two, while Ben-Guinever, and girls are outa-maying, in
one of the most lovely of “As You Like it” woodland scenes (with a
fool in the forest, too)_ever beheld on any stage, Lady Macbeth-
Morgan and Macbeth-Mordred overhear the love-making of Guinny
and Lancy; and in Act Three these “two clever ones,” as r
Affery was wont to style Flintwich and Mrs. Clennam, reveaſ the
truth to Arthur-Othello, who has taken from the hand of the
suicided Ophelia-Elaine (Miss LENA Ashwell) a note, which assists
him in discovering the wickedness of ly Sir Lancy and the giddy
Guinny. Sir Lancy ºries, “Strike on!” and King Henr Irving
Arthur is just “on strike” when he exclaims “I cannot kill thee,”
and Excalibur, a notably sharp blade on occasion, fails him now.
Lancy is banished; and takes it very quietly, going out like a
lamb. King Arthur and all the º go off to the wars, leaving
Guinevere in charge of Sir Macbeth-Mordred and Mrs. Morgan-
le-Fay, female professor of necromancy, table-turning-medium,
“parties attended,” &c.
n Act last Guinevere is imprisoned in a tower, and is made love to
by that awfully Bad Knight, Sir Mordred, who seizes this chance of
º Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert to Guinny’s Rebecca, only
that there is no window from which she can threaten to throw
herself: and so the wicked wooing comes to a rather tame conclusion.
In the last scene Mac-
beth - Mordred and
Lady Morgan-Macbeth"
are now King and
Queen, and poor Re-
becca-Guinny is going
to be burnt à la Juice,
when the herald's chal-
lenge is answered by a
very, Black Knight,
who keeps himself aw-
fully dark, and who
does not say, “I am
RICHARD OEUR DE
Lion,” but lifting his
steel nose - protector
(most useful except
when the Knight has
a bad cold), reveals
“The King !” Then
comes the fight—and
ah, would that here

might have shouted,
“See the Queen drinks

obtained her “coup de
grâce.”
– But no l CoMYNs
CARR would have none
of this. The wicked
flourish. Someone said
that Sir Lancelot was
killed “without,” but
I don't believe it. My private opinion is that the sly dog Lancy
sneaked out quietly, waited for Guinerere, and then, they both went
off together, to Boulogne, or Monte Carlo maybe; that Morgan-le-
Fay took to walking in her sleep and washing out little sanguinary
spots on her hand; and that Mordred got an engagement in the
provinces to play Iago; while all that the audience knºw of King
Arthur is that he went off with three Queens of the Night (perhaps
signifying that he ventured on, a water-party with only three sqve-
reigns) in a barge, perhaps “the craft of Merlin.” mentioned by
TENNyson, to some place down the river, where he was said to be
interred, and at whose grave kept guard the well-knºwn “Water-
bury Watch.” However all this is but surmise. ºne thing is certain
—that King Arthur is still alive, very much alive, and, like Lord
Arthur of Pantomime Rehearsal fame, “going strong,” at the
Lyceum, for very many Arthurian nights to come. Le Roi Arthur
est mort! - Vice le Roi Arthur !
Bravo, Comyns! Well may he say to HENRY Irving, “Eh, mon,
whar's your WULLIE SHAksprare noo?”

who are also more.orlless acquainted with Wagnerianitrilogies.
Weallknow “KETTLE
began it.” Well, WAG-
NER begins this, in the
Prologue, with spirits
and water, i.e., mere
spirits, getting along
swimmingly in a kind
of Niebelungen lake-
and-cavern scene. Not
until the curtain rose
was any sort of atten-
tion paid to the music,
which might have
therefore been the com-
position of Noakes
or Stokes, instead of
having been exquisitely
written by King AR-
THUR SULLIVAN.
Enter King Arthur
Irving and Merlin
(“Charles his friend”),
suggestive of Macbeth
and Banquo, to see Wag-
nerian , water-witches
in The Colleen Bawn's
cave, Wagnerian water-
witches, disturbed by
the approach of gentle-
men, swim away to re-
gain, presumably, their
bathing-machines.
Then Charles-his-friend
Merlin undertakes the
part of a kind of half-
converted Mephisto-
pheles, and shows the
Faust-King-Arthur a
“ living picture” of
Guinevere as Margue-
rite in a vision. After
this up comes a hand

and end of prologue.
Merlin, or a spirit,
ought to have sung “Voici le sabre.” This chance was lost.
he next scene is at Camelot, when in come a lot of knights in
armour, and the story begins in real earnest. Here is ELLEN TERRY
sweet and majestic as the Burne-Jonesian Queen Guinevere, an
here, too, is Forbes-Robertson as Lancelot, a part which he plays
and looks to perfection. The order has been given “Allwigs abandon
ye who enter here,” that is as far as the male ºf are con-
cerned; so, they aii “keep their hair on,” and thus HENRY IRVING
in armour looks more like the “Knight of the Woeful Countenance,”
or a moustachioless Don Quirote, than the glorious Chairman of the
Goodly Round Table Company.
Sir Lancelot is ...i. by “circumstances over which he has
no control.” to remain behind at court, all through the selfishness of
King Arthur (so unlike him, too, for once!), who fancies the Round
Tabſe will be a trifieduli when all his "blºoming companions have
faded ald gone.” and so the unfortunate young knight has to say to
the Queen, as Mr. CHEvaLIER's Coster sings to his “lidy-love,”
“I’m bound to keep on lovin' yer! d'yer'ear?” and he is watched
C-m-ns C-rr (rising to the occasion out of the mystic mere). “Up I come with my little plot!”
by Macbeth-Mordred (Mr. FRANK CoopFR) and his be-witching
mother Lady Macbeth-Morgan-le-Fay (Miss GENEVIEVE WARD).
In Act Two, while Ellen-Guinevere and girls are out a-maying in
one of the most lovely of “As You Like it” woodland scenes (with a
fool in the forest, too) ever beheld on any stage, Lady Macbeth-
Morgan and Macbeth-Mordred overhear the love-making of Guinny
and Lancy; and in Act Three these “two clever ones,” as r
Affery was wont to style Flintwich and Mrs. Clennam, reveaſ the
truth to Arthur-Othello, who has taken from the hand of the
suicided Ophelia-Elaine (Miss LENA Ashwell) a note, which assists
him in discovering the wickedness of ly Sir Lancy and the giddy
Guinny. Sir Lancy cries, “Strike on!” and King Henr Irving
Arthur is just “on strike” when he exclaims “I cannot kill thee,”
and Excalibur, a notably sharp blade on occasion, fails him now.
Lancy is banished; and takes it very quietly, going out like a
lamb. King Arthur and all the º go off to the wars, leaving
Guinevere in charge of Sir Macbeth-Mordred and Mrs. Morgan-
le-Fay, female professor of necromancy, table-turning-medium,
“parties attended,” &c.
n Act last Guinevere is imprisoned in a tower, and is made love to
by that awfully Bad Knight, Sir Mordred, who seizes this chance of
playing Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert to Guinny’s Rebecca, only
that there is no window from which she can threaten to throw
herself: and so the wicked wooing comes to a rather tame conclusion.
In the last scene Mac-
beth - Mordred and
Lady Morgan-Macbeth
are now King and
Queen, and poor Re-
becca-Guinny is going
to be burnt a la Juice,

that Sir Lancelot was

I don't believe it. My private opinion is that the sly dog Lancy
sneaked out quietly, waited for Guinerere, and then, they both went
off together, to Boulogne, or Monte Carlo maybe; that Morgan-le-
Fay took to walking in her sleep and washing out little sanguinary
spots on her hand; and that Mordred got an engagement in the
provinces to play Iago; while all that the audience knºw of King
Arthur is that he went off with three Queens of the Night (perhaps
signifying that he ventured on, a water-party with ºnly three sove-
reigns) in a barge, perhaps “the craft of Merlin” mentioned by
TENNyson, to some place down the river, where he was said to be
interred, and at whose grave kept guard the well-knºwn “Water-
bury Watch.” However all this is but surmise, ºne thing is certain
—that King Arthur is still alive, very unuch alive, and, like Lord
ARTHUR of Pantomime Rehearsal fame, “going strong,” at the
Lyceum, for very many Arthurian nights to come. Le Roi Arthur

PART III.-The Apotheosis of the Picture.
Those who have done me the distinguished honour of reading the
story of my find of a genuine Won Böotz (in my agitation last week
I referred erroneously to the great master as Old Boots) will re-
member that I had got to the point where the picture I now so deeply
prized, had been removed by the handy-man to be sold, no doubt, at
a crushing sacrifice. When put to it (as all my friends know) I am
a man of an iron will and a steel determination. There is no sacrifice
I will not make to carry a fixed plan into execution. It was this iron
will and steel determination that enabled me (somewhat late in life)
to conquer, the apparently adamant, intention of the Examiners at
Lincoln's Inn and get called to the Bar. At this crisis in my life's
history the reserve forces of my nature came to my assistance, and in-
§: me to hurry without a moment's delay to the dwelling-place of
ILKINs.
Before discovering that the Won Bö0Tz had been removed I had
assumed (as it is my...wont after returning from Pump-Handle
Court) my slippers. Without waiting to amend my costume, without
lingering to recover my, umbrella (now reclining in its stand, seem-
ingly exchanging confidences with my walking-stick), I started for
Panorama Place, Nine Sisters Road, Rixton Rise. The lady who has
honoured me by * my name had furnished me with this
address–the abode of the unconsciously-fugitive WILKINs. Without
a moment's hesitation I hailed and entered a four-wheeler.
“Panorama Place, Nine Sisters Road, Rixton Rise,” I said in the
tone of the late Duke of WELLINGTON ordering the advance of the
Guards at Waterloo.
The cabman shook his head, then seemingly pondered, then looked
at me... “Is it near the “ Green Compasses’ P” he asked, after a
I have always considered Mr. WILKINs a model of sobriety. But
then I have only known him in the hours devoted to duty, to the
sweeping of kitchen chimneys, to the re-building of wash-houses,
to the re-papering of studies, to the removal of grand pianos from
basement to attic, and other little domestic offices. In his moments
of relaxation he may be a genial riveur, and in this character
was more likely than not to live in close proximity to the no doubt
hospitable tavern to which the driver if referred. So I answered
my Jehu that I thought it exceedingly possible that Mr. WILKINs
did dwell near the “Green Compasses.” We started, and after a
drive for which I was charged (and in my opinion rightly charged)
five-and-sixpence, arrived safely at Panorama Place, Nine Sisters
Road, Rixton Rise.
The shadow of anxiety that had followed methrough what I may be
º. to term my hackney peregrinations had passed away. I
ad feared that when I had successfully tracked out Mr. WILKINs to
his suburban nest I should find him flown. But no, the eagle had
not lost the child, the handy man was still the possessor of my
pictorial treasure. At least so I presumed, as he smiled when I put
to him the all-important question, “Where is my Won Böotz P”
“This is what I have done with him, Sir,” said my house-
renovator, leading me gently into what I take must have been his
study. The apartment was furnished with two spades, a saw, two
hammers, a pot of glue, a model of a fire-engine, a couple of stools,
and a sideboard.
“Look at this little lot, Sir,” cried Mr. WILKINs, whipping off a
cloth, and exposing to view two earthenware flower-vases, and a
small model (in chalk) of an easily illuminated (there was a recep-
tacle in the interior large enough to contain a taper) cathedral. ..
“What are these?” I demanded, in a voice more or less suggestive
of thunder. -
“That's what he gave me for the picture, and, .# our
lon, Sir, I think I have done well with him. It was one of those
an image-men, who took a fancy to it. He offered at first only
those vases. Then he sprang to a statuette of GARIBALDI. But,
after a deal of discussion, I got him to chuck in Westminster
Abbey, Sir, which, as you see, can be lighted up magnificent.”.
For a moment I was struck speechless with sorrow and indigna-
tion. . No doubt, the foreign hawker, having received an art educa-
tion in º (the renowned dwelling-place of the Muses), had
recognised the value of my picture, and had—. I paused in my
train of thought, and jumped from despair to joy. There, resting on a
newly-renovated perambulator, was my Old Master. I almost wept
as I recognised my nearly lost Won BöoTz.
“But there it is l’” I hoarsely whispered, pointing to the picture.
“The canvas, yes Sir—the Italian chap only wanted the frame.
He called the donkey lot rubbish.”
Again my iron will and steel determination came to the front. To
secure the canvas, charter another four-wheeler, and deposit myself
and my prize within the cab's depths was the work of not more than
five-and-twenty minutes. I drove as hurriedly as the congested
traffic would permit to the house of a well-known connoisseur. I
sent up my card, and was immediately admitted. The celebrated
critic was a perfect stranger to me.
“This must serve as an introduction,” I said, and exposed my
WoN BöoTz to view. The connoisseur inspected the canvas, the
leaden sky, and the villagers with languid interest. At last his
: fell upon the presentment of the donkey. His eyes sparkled,
is cheeks flushed with excitement; and although he was evidentl
attempting to master his emotion, he almost shouted “Magnificent!”
“Are not the ears splendid?” I asked.
“Splendid? Glorious! Immortal!”
“Have you seen anything to equal the mane?”
“Never! Emphatically, never!”
And then the art connoisseur shook me by both hands. Then we
once more inspected the donkey's ears, and in our delight nearly
rose and floated from the floor in a sort of medieval saint-like
ecstasy.
“You see it has one fault,” my conscience made me say; “it has
no signature.”
“A proof that it is a genuine Won Böotz. The grand old forger
never signed anything except copies. As you know, he was scarcely
ever sober, and in his drunken moods used to write his name on any
kind of canvas at the rate of a tumbler of port a signature.”
“And it is only right to add,” I continued, in my character of
Devil's Advocate, and using a piece of information I had picked up
from APPLRBLossom, Q.C., “that it is not in the least like a print
which is supposed to be a contemporaneous engraving.”
“The best possible proof that it is an original. , Old Won Böotz

to what the Philistine (by the way, all things considered, a very
ºlº fellow) would call “business.” I suggested that it was
or sale.
“No, my dear Sir,” corrected the critic; “not for sale. The Won

He sat down at a desk which I now noticed was made of ebony and
decorated with old gold and diamonds, and other precious stones.
He drew a cheque. Then he rose to give it to me. But as he
ed the picture it once more attracted his attention. He resumed
jºi saint-like ecstasy for a second, and then returned to his

“I must be honest,” he murmured as he filled in the figures of
another cheque. Then he turned to me. “You must pardon me for
giving you the purchase-money in two drafts; but my first cheque
exhausted my account at one bank, and I had to draw upon my
balance at another to supply the necessary 1esidue.”
I nearly fainted when I read the amounts.
“Not a word,” said the art connoisseur as he shook me by the
hand. “Although you have, I confess, half my fortune, I am richer
than I was when I met you. The Won Böotz—my Won BöOTz—is
simply of priceless value.”

clerks, and the manager waylaid me at the door to press my hand.

PART III.-The Apotheosis of the Picture.
Those who have done me the distinguished honour of reading the
story of my find of a genuine Won Böotz (in my agitation last week
I referred erroneously to the great master as Old Boots) will re-
member that I had got to the point where the picture I now so deeply
prized, had been removed by the handy-man to be sold, no doubt, at
a crushing sacrifice. When put to it (as all my friends know) I am
a man of an iron will and a steel determination. There is no sacrifice
I will not make to carry a fixed plan into execution. . It was this iron
will and steel determination that enabled me (somewhat late in life)
to conquer, the apparently adamant intention, of the Examiners at
Lincoln's Inn and get called to the Bar. At this crisis in my life's
history the reserve forces of my nature came to my assistance, and in-
§: me to hurry without a moment's delay to the dwelling-place of
ILKINs.
Before discovering that the Won BöoTz had been removed I had
assumed (as it is my...wont after returning, from Pump-Handle
Court) my slippers. Without waiting to amend my costume, without
lingering to recover my umbrella (now reclining in its stand, seem-
ingly exchanging confidences with my walking-stick), I started for
Panorama Place, Nine Sisters Road, Rixton Rise. The lady who has
honoured me by accepting my name had furnished me with this
address–the abode of the unconsciously-fugitive WILKINs. Without
a moment's hesitation I hailed and entered a four-wheeler.
“Panorama Place, Nine Sisters Road, Rixton Rise,” I said in the
tone of the late Duke of WELLINGTON ordering the advance of the
Guards at Waterloo. . .
The cahman, shook his head, then seemingly pondered, then looked
at me... “Is it near the “Green Compasses” he asked, after a
I have always considered Mr. WILKINs a model of sobriety. But
then I have only known him in the hours devoted to º: to the
sweeping of kitchen chimneys, to the re-building of wash-houses,
to the re-papering of studies, to the removal of grand pianos from
basement to attic, and other little domestic offices. . In his moments
of relaxation he may be a genial riveur, and in this character
was more likely than not to live in close {". to the no doubt
hospitable tavern to which the driver had referr So I answered
my Jehu that I thought it exceedingly possible that Mr. WHKINs
did dwell near the “Green Compasses.” We started, and after a
drive for which I was charged (and in my opinion rightly charged)
five-and-sixpence, arrived safely at Panorama Place, Nine Sisters
Road, Rixton Rise.
The shadow of anxiety that had followed methrough what I may be
F. to term my hackney peregrinations had passed away. I
ad feared that when I had successfully tracked out Mr. WILKINs tº
his suburban nest I should find him flown. But no, the eagle had
not lost the child, the handy man was still the pºssessor of my
pictorial treasure. At least so I presumed, as he smiled when I put
to him the all-important question, “Where is my Won BöOTz P”
“This is what I have done with him, Sir,” said my house-
renovator, leading me gently into what I take must have been his
study. The apartment was furnished with two spades, a saw, two
hammers, a pot of glue, a model of a fire-engine, a couple of stools,
and a sideboard. - -
“Look at this little lot, Sir,” cried Mr. WILKINs, whipping off a
cloth, and *::... view two earthenware flower-vases, and a
small model (in chalk) of an easily illuminated (there was a recep-
tacle in the interior large enough to contain a taper) cathedral. ..
“What are these?” I demanded, in a voice more or less suggestive
of thunder.
“That's what he gave me for the picture, and, .# §.
§: Sir, I think I have done well with him. It was one of those
talian image-men, who took a fancy to it. He offered at first only
those vases. Then he sprang to a statuette of GARIBALDI. But,
after a deal of discussion, I got him to chuck in Westminster
Abbey, Sir, which, as you see, can be lighted up magnificent.”
For a moment I was struck speechless with sorrow and indigna-
tion. . No doubt, the foreign, hawker, having received an art educa;
tion in Italy (the renowned dwelling-place of the Muses), had
recognised the value of my picture, and had—. I paused in my
train of thought, and jumped #. despair to joy. There, resting on a
newly-renovated perambulator, was my Old Master. I almost wept
as I recognised my nearly lost Won BöOTz.
“But there it is l’” I hoarsely whispered, pointing to the picture.
“The canvas, yes Sir-the Italian chap only wanted the frame.
He called the donkey lot rubbish.”
Again my iron will and steel determination came to the front. To
secure the canvas, charter another four-wheeler, and deposit myself
and my prize within the cab's depths was the work of not more than
five-and-twenty minutes. I drove as hurriedly as the congested
traffic would permit to the house of a well-known connoisseur. I
sent up my card, and was immediately admitted. The celebrated
critic was a perfect stranger to me.
“This must serve as an introduction,” I said, and exposed my
Won Böotz to view. The connoisseur inspected the canvas, the
leaden sky, and the villagers with languid interest. At last his
gaze fell upon the presentment of the donkey. His eyes sparkled,
his cheeks flushed with excitement; and although he was evidently
attempting to master his emotion, he almost shouted “Magnificent!”
“Are not the ears splendid?” I asked.
44 i. Glorious! Immortal!”
“Have you seen anything to equal the mane?”
“Never! Emphatically, never!”
And then the art connoisseur shook me by both hands. Then we
once more inspected the donkey's ears, and in our delight nearly
rose and floated from the floor in a sort of medieval saint-like
ecstasy.
“You see it has one fault,” my conscience made me say; “it has
no signature.”
“A proof that it is a genuine Won Böotz. The grand old forger
never signed anything except copies. As you know, he was scarcely
ever sober, and in his drunken moods used to write his name on any
kind of canvas at the rate of a tumbler of port a signature.”
“And it is only right to add,” I continued, in my character of
Devil's Advocate, and using a º of information I had picked up
from APPLRBLossom, Q.C., “that it is not in the least like a print
which is supposed to be a contemporaneous engraying.” -
“The best possible proof that it is an original. , Old Won Böotz

And so the picture that had been sent to the box-room and nar-

(A Shakspearian Foreshadowing of the Situation
in France.)
PROPHETIC Swan! To picture in advance
The future's pageantry of personage . .
And scene was thine unique prerogative;
So easily thy creations take the mould
Of aftertimes and characters unborn.
Paris to-day seems Padua, thy fair shrew,
The tricksy termagant, “curst Katharine,”
The Paduan Xantippe, prickly, perverse,
Yet fascinating vixen, dons to-day
A Gallic guise, and fumes in French, and
flounces
In skirts d la République.
- What said Gremiof
“Your gifts are so good, here’s none will
hold you.’”
And who may hold the fair Lutetian shrew P
No man, “I wis,” is “half-way to her heart
But if he were, doubt not her care should be
To comb his noddle with a three-legg'd stool,
And paint his face, and use him like a fool.”
Here's Katharine—but where's Petruchio f
“What ' shall I be appointed hours, as
though, belike
I knew not what to take, and what to
leave, ha!”
There speaks the sweet-faced shrew, and
takes to-day
What she will leave to-morrow. Yet she
shines
In the description of Hortensio.
“With wealth enough, and young, and
beauteous;
Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman;
Her only fault (and that is faults enough)
Is, that she is intolerably curst,
And shrewd, and froward; so beyond all
measure,
That, were my state far worser than it is,
"An a man could but haply light on them,
Would take the veriest vixen “with all
faults.”
And many a one hath said, or seemed to say,
“For I will board her, though she chide
as loud
As thunder, when the clouds in autumn
crack.”
But with what issue? Like Hortensio,
His head is broken by the vixen's lute,
Ere he hath time to teach her government
Of frets or stops, or skilful fingering.
How many, with Hortensio, might say,
When asked if he could break her to the
lute,
“Why, no ; for she hath broke the lute to me.
I did but tell her, she mistook her frets,
And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering;
When with a most impatient devilish spirit,
‘Frets, call you these ?’ quoth she “I’ll
fume with them :’
And with that word, she struck me on the head,
And through the instrument my pate made
way:
And there I stood amazed for a while,
As on a ſº looking through the lute :
While she did call me, rascal fiddler,
And twangling Jack; with twenty such vile
terms
As she had studied to misuse me so.
Her masters have not learned true mastery,
And he, her latest would-be teacher, turns
Too prompt and pusillanimous a back
Upon his wilful pupil, beaten off
Quicker than buffeted Hortensio
In poor, poltroonish, post-deserting flight;
Leaving the lute whose harmonies his hand
Should have bowed hers to, broken and
unstrung,
In the shrews angry and outrageous grasp:
See how the Gallic Katharine in her fume,
Flouting all mastery, flouncing uncontrolled
Infurious anger, flings the shattered lute,
Unstrung, aside, as did the Paduan shrew,
“Come, come you wasp : 'faith you are too
angry!” friends.
So, in Petruchio's words, say France's
Whilst foes and half-allies look doubtful on,
From the chill Eastward or more genial North,
Wondering what stable faith, in love or hate,
May rest upon such shifting shrewishness.
Where waits Petruchio, and will he come
In purple velvet, or in soldier steel,
Or simple, civic, hero-covering cloth,
To tame this Katharine of the Phrygian cap,
And smiling, in the mocking calm of power,
Say of the shrew, like him of Padua:-
“ Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?
Hare I not in my time heard lion's roar Ž
Have I not heard the sea, puff"d up with
winds,
Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat ž
Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,
And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies f
Have I not in a pitched battle heard

TALL TALES OF SPORT AND ADVENTURE.
I.—THE PINK HIPPOPOTAMUS. (continued.)
Shortly after the great victory of the Dead Marshes, the British
Army, under the command of Sir BonAMY BATTLEHoRN, took pos-
session of Balmuggur, the capital of the country, known far and
wide as the Diamond City of the Ranee. There was a faint show of
resistance, but after I had defeated in single combat six picked
mollahs of the Royal Guard, the disheartened garrison laid down its
arms, and the place surrendered at discretion. We had brought
HADJU THAR MEEBHoy with us, although, in his perforated condi-
tion, it was a matter of some difficulty to transport him. Still it
would have been barbarous to leave him behind to the tender
mercies of the neighbouring peasantry, and we resolved to attempt
his conveyance to Balmuggur. Fortunately we succeeded beyond
our most sanguine hopes. I was able to render him some slight
services on the march, and, after the city had fallen, I paid him
daily visits, during which I conceived a sincere and lasting friend-
ship for the gallant fellow whose only fault, after all, had been the
notion that he could defeat one who
has never yet given way an inch
before the hottest attack even of
overwhelming numbers. It was
quite touching to see his swarthy
face brighten into a smile when
entered the room. He looked for-
ward eagerly to my daily visit, and
often told me that the simple tales
of my courage and daring with
which I entertained him were of
more use to him than all the oint-
ments and bandages and medicines
with which dear old Toby O'GRADy
used to treat his wound. On his º
side the MEEBHOY, too, was confi- -
dential. Many an hour have I
spent with him listening to his
stories of court plot and palace
intrigue in Balmuggur, dark epi-
sodes of passion and crime and
sudden death.
One morning I was sitting as
usual by the MEEBHoy's bedside. I
had just related to him my adven-
ture with the Lord Mayor of Dublin,
whom, as readers of contemporary
journals will remember, I had been
compelled to chastise for the un-
pardonable affront of calling me by
my Christian name at a public
meeting, by kicking him bodily
from end to end of the Rotunda,
breaking three chandeliers as he
spun through the air, and imprint-
ing the º of his back on the
$1. wall, where it may still be
observed by the curious. This ad-
venture, and the story of my sub-
sequent escape from the dungeons
of the Dublin Mansion House, have rarely failed to extort applause
from those to whom I have narrated them. But on this occasion the
MEEBHoy was silent and distrait. He lay for some time drumming
in an absent-minded way with his fingers on the front aluminium
door of his wound (the famous operation had by this time been suc-
cessfully performed), and made no comment whatever on the tale
I had related to him. Then suddenly he turned, looked me full in
the face, and addressed me. “Harkye, Sirrah,” he observed, “your
story has interested me strangely; but there is that in my mind
which demands an exit. Methinks that they who hold governance
here mistake me strangely. Because I am all but corpsed, they
think they can neglect this JoHNNY. The Ranee has but once sent
a stable-helper to inquire after me... Grammercy, but such treat-
ment is scurvy, and I mean to show the old witch that HAnju Thºr
knows what's what, and, by Jingo, he's going to have it all the
time. That's so.”. I have forgotten, I º to mention that my
friend had learnt his English in Seringapatam from such examples
as he could lay his hands on in that remote island, and the result
was a certain patchiness of style, which did not, however, by any
means, interfere with the vigour and fluency of his diction.
“Do F. ..". I said, “that this slight is intentional?
Really, I cannot believe that the Ranee would willingly neglect so
gallant and devoted a servant.”
“I perceived the Ranee's Chamberlain.”
“That shows me you little know the Queen of the Diamond City.
profundity of design and daring of execution, she’d give a man-
eating tiger two stone and a handsome beating over any course you
care to name. But I am resolved to be avenged. Never shall it be
said that the descendant of a thousand kings had the comether put on
him by a cinder-faced old omadhaun like that. See here now,” he
continued, drawing me closer to him, while he glanced furtively
round and sank his yoice to a whisper, “it’s yourself I'm talking to.
Hast heard of the Pink Hippopotamus P”
“What!” I replied; “the sacred animal of the Seringapatamese
the dweller in the inaccessible mountain fastness of Jam Tirnova, the
deathless guardian of the royal race of this island?”
“The same,” he answered calmly; “no mortal foot, save those of
his priests, has ever yet approached him. The perils are manifold,
the attempt is well nigh desperate, but you're not the game chicken
I take you for if you don't accomplish his capture and discomfit the
haughty Ranee. Crikey, but I'd like to hear the old gal squeal
when they tell her her bloomin' hippo's got took. Blime if I
wouldn't.”
“But how shall I set about it, what steps ought I to take P’’
“Is it steps you mane? What in thunder is the man wanting? Here,
boy, take these papers. I have set
down in them clearly how the
matter may best be undertaken.
Peruse them and learn them well.
If you have resource, courage and
prudence, within a week the prize
shall beyours, and the insult offered
to me shall be expiated.”
With that he pressed a bundle of
Fº into my hand, and bade me
eave
him.
. As I left the tent I heard a
scuffling of feet. ... I darted in the
direction in which I thought they
had gone, and there sure enough,
running as if he wanted to break
a hundred yards record, I per-
ceived the Ranee's Chamberlain. I
set off after him, nothing loth to
give an example of my sp Be-
sides, if the old fellow had over-
heard us our doom was sealed; it
was necessary to capture and silence
him. In ten strides I was close up
to him. In another moment I was
near enough to seize him. Istretched
out my hand to do so, when sud-
denly he gave º yells,
turned round in a swift pirouette,
and, before I had realised what
ad happened, landed me a tre-
: mendous kick full on the chest.
The force of the blow was terrible,
and only my iron bones could have
withs it. Seeing that I still
advanced he made at me again.
This time, however, I was too
quick for him. I seized him by his
uplifted ankle, and, regardless of
his appeal for mercy, whirled him
three times round my head and flung him from me. His shoe remained
in my hand, but beyond that no trace of the miserable Chamberlain
has ever been discovered. He simply yanished from human knowledge
as completely as though his body had been resolyed into its elements.
It is true that Professor Spooks of the University of Caffraria
declared that a new meteor had on that very day appeared in South
Africa travelling eastwards. His discovery was scoffed, at by the
scientific, but for my own part I have sometimes thought that, with a
telescope of sufficient power, the learned Professor might have been
able to establish an identity between his supposed comet and the lost
Chamberlain of the Ranee.
Having thus dispatched my foe, I returned to my own quarters to
study the papers of the MEKBhoy.
As I entered my room a terrible sight met my eyes.

[ALBERT TRott, in the latest representative cricket match between Mr.

One morning I was sitting as
usual by the MEEBHoy's bedside. I
had just related to him my adven-
ture with the Lord Mayor of Dublin,
whom, as readers of contemporary
journals will remember, I had been
compelled to chastise for the un-
pardonable affront of calling me by
my Christian name at a F.
meeting, by kicking him bodily
from end to end of the Rotunda,
breaking three chandeliers as he
spun through the air, and imprint-
ing the º of his back on the
†. wall, where it may still be
observed by the curious. This ad-
venture, and the story of my sub-
sequent escape from the dungeons
of the Dublin Mansion House, have rarely failed to extort applause
from those to whom I have narrated them. But on this occasion the
MEEbhoy was silent and distrait. He lay for some time drumming
in an absent-minded way with his fingers on the front aluminium
door of his woundº famous operation had by this time been suc-
cessfully performed), and made no comment whatever on the tale
I had related to him. Then suddenly he turned, looked me full in
the face, and addressed me. “Harkye, Sirrah,” he observed, “your
story has interested me strangely; but there is that in my mind
which demands an exit. Methinks that they who hold governance
here mistake me strangely. Because I am but corpsed, they
think they can neglect this John NY. The Ranee has but once sent
a stable-helper to inquire after me... Grammercy, but such treat-

friend had learnt his English in Seringapatam from such examples
as he could lay his hands on in that remote island, and the result
was a certain patchiness of style, which did not, however, by any
means, interfere with the vigour and fluency of his diction.
“Do F. suppose,” I said, “that this slight, is intentional?
Really, I cannot believe that the Ranee would willingly neglect so
gallant and devoted a servant.”

continued, drawing me closer to him, while he glanced furtively
round and sank his yoice to a whisper, “it’s yourself I'm talking to.

“What!” I replied; “the sacred animal of the Seringapatamese
the dweller in the inaccessible mountain fastness of Jam Tirnova, the
deathless guardian of the royal race of this island?”
"The same,” he answered calmly; “no mortal foot, save those of
his priests, has ever yet approached him. The perils are manifold,
the attempt is well nigh desperate, but you're not the game chicken
I take you for if you don't accomplish his capture and discomfit the
haughty Ranee. Crikey, but I'd like to hear the old gal squeal

“But how shall I set about it, what steps ought I to take?”
“Is it steps you mane? What in thunder is the man wanting? Here,

TALL TALES OF SPORT AND ADVENTURE.
I.—THE PINK HIPPOPOTAMUS. (continued.)
Shortly after the great victory of the Dead Marshes, the British
Army, under the command of Sir BonAMY BATTLEHoRN, took pos-
session of Balmuggur, the capital of the country, known far and
wide as the Diamond City of the Ranee. There was a faint show of
resistance, but after I had defeated in º combat six picked
mollahs of the Royal Guard, the disheartened garrison laid down its
arms, and the place surrendered at discretion. We had brought
HADJU THAR MEEBHoy with us, although, in his perforated condi-
tion, it was a matter of some difficulty to transport him. Still it
would have been barbarous to leave him behind to the tender
mercies of the neighbouring peasantry, and we resolved to attempt
his conveyance to Balmuggur. Fortunately we succeeded beyond
our most sanguine hopes. I was able to render him some slight
services on the march, and, after the city had fallen, I paid him
daily visits, during which I conceived a sincere and lasting friend-
ship for the gallant fellow whose only fault, after all, had been the
notion that he could defeat one who
has never yet given way an inch
before the hottest attack even of
overwhelming numbers. It was
quite touching to see his swarthy
face brighten into a smile when
entered the room. He looked for-
ward eagerly to my daily visit, and
often told me that the simple tales
of my courage and daring with
which I entertained him were of
more use to him than all the oint-
ments and bandages and medicines
with which dear old Toby O'GRADy
used to treat his wound. On his
side the MEEbhoy, too, was confi-
dential. Many an hour have I
spent with him listening to his
stories of court plot and palace
intrigue in Balmuggur, dark epi-
sodes of passion and crime and
sudden death.
One morning I was sitting as
usual by the MEEbHoy's bedside. I
had just related to him my adven-

was a numerous attendance of authors and reviewers with a sprink-

Chairman in presenting the report of the Directors regretted that he
was unable to congratulate the Society on having accomplished the
primary object of its existence, the filling up of the vacant laureate-
thip. He himself, he said, had done his best. He had discovered a
new sun in the firmament of poetry at least once a month, and had
never hesitated to publish the name of his selection in one of the re-
views. He was still willing to take seven to four about Mr. John
DAVIDson and Mr. FRANCIs THoMPson, Mr. WILLIAM WATson
barred. The balance-sheet of the Society did not show a very
flourishing state of affairs. As assets they could enter fifteen
sonnets, twelve irregularly rhymed odes (one by Mr. RICHARD LE
GALLIENNE), twenty-four volumes of a strictly limited edition issued
from the Bºdley Head, four tons of the Yellow Book, and an unpub-
lished selection of manuscript poems written by a victim to delirium
tremens whose name he was not at liberty to mention. On the other
side, however, they had to face the fact that their expenses had been
heavy. It was becoming more and more costly and difficult to feed
the public on geniuses, and he was inclined to advise the discontinu-
ance of this branch of the Society's operations.
At this point some commotion was caused by Mr. LE GALLIENNE
and Mr.ARTHUR WAUGH, who rose simultaneously to protest against
the Chairman's remarks. Mr. LE GALLIENNE was so far carried
away by his agitation as to hurl a*: at Mr. GRANT ALLEN's
head. In the uproar which ensued, Mr. LE GALLIENNE could be
heard ejaculating “beautiful phrases,” “richly-coloured musical
sentences,” “ideal and transgendental,” “nothing finer since LAME,”
“...all for eighteenpence,” and “a genius who sleeps below the wood-
igeons.” The pamphlet thus discharged proved to be by a Mr.
oh N EGLINToN, and Mr. LE GALLIENNE was removed in the
custody of a police-inspector, who was described by Mr. WAUGH as a
Philistine.
LEwis MoRRIs and Mr. ERIC MACKAY made similar complaints.
The latter offered to write patriotic poems with plenty of rhymes in
them against any other living man. Would the meeting allow him
to recite—?
At this point the Chairman interposed, and said that the Directors
had decided against recitations—a statement which provoked loud
murmurs of dissatisfaction. Eventually, Mr. LE GALLIENNE (who
had returned, disguised in proof-sheets), proposed a vote of thanks
to Mr. John DAVIDson, who proposed a vote of thanks to Mr. GRANT
ALLEN, who proposed a vote of thanks to Mr. FRANCIs Thompson,
who Fº a vote of thanks to Mr. ARTHUR WAUGH, who pro-
posed a vote of thanks to Mr. John LANE, who proposed a vote of
thanks to Mr. LE GALLIENNE. All these having been unanimously
passed, the meeting broke up.
QUEER QUERIES.—WAR of WoRDs.-A propos of Mr. PLow-
DEN's decision in the “Flannelette case,” can that worthy magistrate
have foreseen some of its effects? For instance, wanting to buy a
sideboard, I went to a furniture-dealer's, and saw one, "Pºº

the answer given me, “Mahoganette,” by the shop-walker. So I

him. He said it meant “little,” adding, with a wink, that I should
find “precious little butter, too.” And this was the case. What

markable insight into dog-nature, so far, that
is, as one who is not a dog, but a mere lover
of dogs, can judge. Spot tells his own story
in a straightforward, honest, doggy style,
which must commend him at once to the
hearts of his readers. His reflections, from
the canine point of view, are admirably just.
He never cared for flowers. “How vapid,”
he says, “is the scent of a rose, for instance,
compared with that of an old seasoned
bone.” The force of the remark must be

exhuming with furtive labour a bone he had
buried a week before. A firm foe to cats, he

do. The bull-dog's greeting to him is, in
itself, a revelation of character. “Cheer up,
youngster! Any good smells hereabouts?”
says that redoubtable animal; whereupon
they saunter together round by the back of
the house, “passing few smells of any im:

To see some “feats of modern magic.”

Nor could you easily see through them,
And few of those who “understood

Although my fair companions tittered,
But then the scoundrel in their view
Remarked, “Is this your usual habit?”
And from my pocket calmly drew
The watch—suspended from a rabbit!
The foolish people laughed and cheered,
And as I fled in hasty fashion,

ARTHUR Roberts, King Arthur, at the
Lyceum, and ARTHUR A BECRETT at the
Garrick. Theatre, where Faded Flowers,
revived, are once again blooming. It is a
retty piece, well played by Mr. ARTHUR
oURCHIER—encore" un Arthur—and Mrs.
Boukchi ER, known to the public as Miss
Wrolet WANBRUGH. A littleTERRY boy, aged
nine, is in it, and MR. BUIST does his very
Buist, or best. The occasion of the revival
was the resuscitation of A Pair of Spectacles,
in which Mr. John HARE is better than ever:
and, indeed, he has made it one of his very
best eccentric comedy parts. Again Mr.
GRoves delights us with his hardwareish im-
personation of “the man from Sheffield,”, a
very happy thought on the part of the
author-adapter, Mr. GRUNDY.
The occasion of the revival, too, was also
noteworthy as being the début of another of
the TERRY family, the ingénue of the comedy
being played by Miss MABEL TERRY LEWIs,
who certainly inherits no small share of the
TERRY. Talent. Mr. GERALD DU MAURIER, too,
is excellent in a marvellously made-up small
character part; and Bentre HARE--the heir
of HARE-is very good as the youngster. Mr.
HARE has fitted on this “pair of spectacles”
just in time; not to have done so would have
been shortsighted policy; and through them
no doubt he sees his way to a long and highly
satisfactory run. These two revivals Mr.
HARE may consider not as “a pair of specs,”
but as “a couple of certainties.”

TALL TALES OF SPORT AND ADVENTURE.
(By Mr. Punch's own Short Story-teller.
I.—THE PINK HIPPOPOTAMU.S. (continued.)
On the opposite side of the room, with his brave old back agains
the wall, stood my dear father, his arms tightly bound to his sides,
a cummerbund tied firmly over that mouth which had never,
save in moments of thoughtless, but pardonable anger, spoken any

not all. On one side of the gigantic catlay coiled an immense
É. elephants I have ever seen was squatting on its haunches,
linking at my poor father with its wicked little eyes. I knew at
once what had happened. My father's only weakness was a fondness
amounting to mania for con#. tricks of all kinds. The latest mail
had brought us some English papers containing descriptions of the
Cabinet Trick of the DAVENPoRT Brothers, who were at that time
(this may help to fix the date, a point on which I have never cared
to trouble myself) astounding all London by their dexterity in un-
tying themselves from ropes lashed securely round them. As soon
as he had read the accounts my father determined that he would
ractise the trick, and for a week past he had spent hours in our
little room with, coils of rope wound round every part of his bod
in the effort, which had hitherto proved vain, to release himself.
Every day the heroic old fellow, still panting from his intolerable
exertions, had murmured “I am all but undone,” but never—if
the expression may be pardoned —had he been so near his utter un-
doing as he was at this awful moment. Of course I knew what had
happened. The dastardly Chamberlain, whose discomfiture I have
already narrated, must have got wind of my father's daily practice,
and, taking advantage of his state of bondage, must have intro-
duced into our room its present horrible occupants. The room was
not a large, one, and the stairs leading to it were steep, and I have
never yet been able, to explain to myself satisfactorily by what
masterpiece of diabolical ingenuity the scoundrel was able to carry
out his stratagem.
However, this was no moment for discovering explanations. The
situation required instant action. Fortunately, my father's eyes
were unbandaged, and for the space of half-an-hour, as it afterwards
turned out, he had been able to control his zoological invaders by the
mere magnetism of his unwavering glance. One wink, however, was
bound to prove fatal, and I saw from the beads of perspiration stand-
ing upon the old man's rugged forehead that he must be very near
the limit of his º. of keeping both eyes open. If a drop of
F. should happen to roll into one of his eyes there could be,
knew, but one end to the business.
As good luck would have it, the animals had not noticed my
entrance. I immediately decided what to do. Addressing my father
silently in the deaf and dumb language, of which I am a master, I
adjured him to stand firm for another moment or two. I could see
from the expression of trustful thankfulness, which stealing over his
face, robbed it of every vestige of anxiety, that he had understood my
appeal. Then creeping cautiously to a cupboard, I opened it with-
out the slightest noise and found, as I expected, a small coil of rope
and a dish of Sallòns, a very tasty kind of native cake. Taking two
of these, I tied one to each end of the rope, and threw it deftly so that
one cake ..º. under the elephant's trunk, while the other, by a
stroke of good fortune, fell right into the wide open jaws of the python.
The slack, as I intended, alighted gently in a running noose round
the tiger's throat. What I anticipated happened. The snake, with-
out troubling itself to discover whence the gift had come, swallowed
the Sallón with which fate had so unexpectedly provided it. In
doing so it pulled the dainty at the other end slightly away from the
mammoth, who, seeing it moving from him, lost no time in seizing it
with his trunk and placing it, as is the wont of these animals, in his
mouth. The rope was immediately pulled taut, and began to choke
the tiger. His roars were awful but unavailing. Neither elephant
not python would release his hold, and in just seventy-four seconds
—I took the time by my stop-watch—the beautiful striped brute was
a corpse. This, however, was not all. So hard did the two livin
beasts struggle in their fearful tu
º:
of the deadliest kind, and on the other one of the tallest and most
moveable father's feet. What would be the result of the contest ?
The agony of watching was frightful. In my suspense I tried to
breathe a prayer, but at the time all I could remember was the fifth
proposition of the first book of Euclid, which I repeated twice over
without a single mistake. Meanwhile, the two combatants, as the
Sallóns went further and further down their throats and into their
stomachs, approached closer and closer to one another. At last only
a yard, then a foot, then six inches, then an inch separated them
until at last-Great heaven! my hair, even as I write, stands on en
with unutterable horror—I saw the python open its enormous jaws to
their fullest extent and swallow, yes, literally swallow the trunk,
the tusks, and the vast head of the elephant. Slowly the immense
pachyderm disappeared. I heard his great bones crack and shiver
as inch after inch of him was remorselessly engulfed until, after three
minutes and fourteen seconds, all that visibly remained of him was a
little tail, which for a space waggled feebly out of the snake's mouth.
Then this, too, was still. Another gulp and it was gone, and all was over.
To dispatch the python in its distended condition was the work of
a moment. I at once released the old man who had been the
delighted spectator of my successful cunning. His joy, as may be
imagined, was great, but his pride in his son was even greater than
his joy. I exacted from him a promise (which, Iregretto say, he broke
only a few days afterwards) never again to practise the Cabinet Trick.
Then, having rung the bell and ordered my servant to carry away the
remains of the three beasts, I proceeded to make my preparations for
starting without delay in quest of the Pink Hippopotamus.

4. These are not to run, walk, or
scuffle about with, after, or away from,
any ball whatever, nor to tumble about
under any pretence, nor to perform
any evolution which may be calcu-

5. The play shall be conducted by
the umpires, who are to be of the
male sex. -
6. There shall be eleven umpires on each side.
7. In all cases where possible, the match shall be settled withoutre-
sorting to brute force, or needless waste of time and breath, by appeal-
ing immediately before “kick-off” to the arbitration of the referee.
8. The referee shall be the most intelligent, and elderly, foreign

all further play.
11. It shall § permissible, and, indeed, recommended, that any, or

game, and attend to the lady-players, and no umpire shall be ruled
“off-side” for so doing. - --- -

THE BATTLE OF EVESHAM.
WHO WON IT
DEAR SIR,--The answer to this question is
simplicity itself—my League did it. We got
the Labourers Allotments and we gained our

TARY of THE TRULY
RURAL LABoukers'
LEAGUE.
DEAR SIR,-From
careful inquiries
made in London, I'm
convinced that the
principles underly-
ing our League resulted in Colonel Long's
return. Englishmen are, after all, rts-
men; and Worcestershire is an integral por-
tion of England. If more proof is wanted,
I need only mention that only one day before
theº; we received an application from
Evesham for the formation of a local branch.
ThE SEC. of THE SPORTIVE LEAGUE.
DEAR SIR,-We did the trick. We had five
the contest we paid 53,219 visits, leaving
2,159,549 leaflets. We’ve learnt our tactics
from organ-grinders who are paid to go into
the next street. Rather than keep us with
them, the electors promise us their votes.
Next pleasel THE SECRETARY OF THE
IRISH ULSTERICAL BRIGADE.
DEAR SIR,--I believe some were foolish
enough to imagine that South Worcestershire
men were going to abandon their Collings to
follow Home Rule. But, as I knew, it could
not be, and it was not. The agricultural
labourer knows his friend when he sees him;
and Colonel Long is M.P. to-day because of
the unceasing efforts of the Labourers'
Friend, J-SSE C-LL-Ngs.
DEAR SIR-It is very good of you to, ask
me my opinion. I think that the Evesham
contest ended in the way it did because of
(a) the :#; (b) the Floods, (c) the Out
Voters, and (d) the Independent Labour Party.
The connection with the last named may not
be obvious. In point of fact, it isn't. But,
as a true Liberal, I feel bound to allege it.
THE MAN who DID NOT GET IN.
DEAR SIR,-I º find time to answer the
question,-‘‘How did I win Evesham P” . I
won it because, whilst my opponent got only
3,585 votes, I polled 4,760. As 3,585 is, even
to the naked eye, distinctly less than 4,760, I
was declared elected. In my humble judg-
ment—though I ...'...; that I am an

DEAR SIR,--The answer to this question is

DEAR SIR,--I believe some were foolish
enough to imagine that South Worcestershire
men were going to abandon their Collings to
follow Home Rule. But, as I knew, it could Ah
not be, and it was not. The agricultural
labourer knows his friend when he sees him;
and Colonel Long is M.P. to-day because of
the unceasing efforts of the Labourers'
Friend, J–ssE C-LL-Ngs.
DEAR SIR-It is very good of you to ask
me my opinion. I think that the Evesham
contest ended in the way it did because of

THE BATTLE OF EVESHAM.
WHO Won IT
DEAR SIR,--The answer to this question is
simplicity itself-my League did it. We got
the Labourers Allotments and we gained our
quid pro quo (this

n supplied by a
distinguishedpatron
of ours)invotes. All
efforts to prove that
IMPEy's the friend,
not LoNG, were in
vain. But the credit
that it was not so
isours.--THESECRE-
TARY of THE TRULY
RURAL LABourERs'
LEAGUE.
DEAR SIR,-From
careful inquiries
made in London, I'm
convinced that the
principles underly-
ing our League resulted in Colonel Long's
return. Englishmen are, after all, rts-
men; and Worcestershire is an integral por-
tion of England. If more proof is wanted,
I need only mention that only one day before
the polling we received an application from
Ev for the formation of a local branch.
THE SEC. of THE SPORTIVE LEAGUE.
DEARSIR,-We did the trick. We had five
the contest we paid 53,219 visits, leaving
2,159,549 leaflets. We’ve learnt our tactics
from organ-grinders who are paid to go into
the next street. Rather than keep us with
them, the electors promise us their votes.
Next please! THE SECRETARY OF THE
IRISH ULSTERICAL BRIGADE.
DEAR SIR,--I believe some were foolish
enough to imagine that South Worcestershire
men were going to abandon their Collings to
follow Home Rule. But, as I knew, it could
not be, and it was not. The agricultural
labourer knows his friend when he sees him;
and Colonel Long is M.P. to-day because of
- efforts of the Labourers'
J–ssE C-LL-Ngs.
DEAR SIR-It is very good of you to, ask
me my opinion. I think that the Evesham
contest ended in the way it did because of
(a) the :#; (b) the Floods, (c) the Out
Voters, and (d) the Independent Labour Party.
The connection with the last named may not
be obvious. In point of fact, it isn't. But,
as a true Liberal, Ifeel bound to allege it.
THE MAN who DID Not GET IN.
DEARSIR,-Igladly find time to answer the
question,-" How did I win Evesham f" . I
won it because, whilst my opponent got only
3,585 votes, I polled 4,760. As 3,585 is, even
to the naked eye, distinctly less than 4,760, I
was declared elected. In my humble judg-
ment—though I º: that I am an
interested party—the Returning, Qfficer took
the only course that was open to him.

“ABBEY THought l”—“The Quest of the
Holy Grail.” These pictures are being ex-
hibited just at the right time, when the
Arthurian ºf nd is attracting at the Lyceum,
Mr. Edwin A. ABBEY has been five years at
work upon this most striking series. Their
beauties are many: their faults very few, and
when these are pointed out to the Anglo-
American artist, he gaily replies, “What's
the odds as long as I’m Abbey.' " . Which is
true; as none but himself can be his parallel.
A WILDE “IDEAL HUSBAND.”
MR. OsCAR WILDE's Ideal Husband, at the
Haymarket, is an interesting play up to the
end of the Third Act; and if this climax had
been contrived more artistically, and less con-
ventionally, the situation at the fall of the
curtain in this act would have been a very
powerful one. ... As it is it is frittered away in
conventional dialogue, and the Fourth Act is
decidedly weak. It is throughout excellently
played by Miss JULIANEILson and Mr. WAL-
LER in the two principal characters. Mr. HAw-
TRRY's performance, in spite of his curious
habit of raising his voice to such a pitch as to
suggest his playing to the cab-rank outside,
is admirable. ere are here and there sharp
bits of dialogue in it, though scarcely a line
in the lighter vein that rises above farcical
comedy.
Mr. Bishop's Earl of Caversham is a
thoroughly natural piece of acting, and
Mr. BrookFIELD's Phipps, the Butler, a hit
of character so perfectly rendered that, like
Sam Weller's Walentine, it makes you “wish
as there was morein it.” Miss FANNYBROUGH,
having plenty to say, but not much worth
listening to, does her 'best with a poor part.
Miss MAUDE MILLETT is nice, and Miss Flo-
RENCE WEST as unsympathetic as her part
was intended to be. That when Sir Robert
Chiltern proposed to retire from, Parlia-
Inen life no one suggested to him that
he should take “the Chiltern Hundreds” is
evidently an oversight of the author's, which
no doubt he now deeply regrets. The play,
though, in sharp dialogue not up to. Mr.
WILDE's i. spirits-and-water mark, is an
unmistakable success.

COY CLIENTS.
In the new Commercial Court. A thin
sprinkling of Juniors, one or two Q.C.'s,
Ishers, and the usual contingent of
people from the street who are glad of
shelter and a seat, and who do not even
pretend to take any interest in the pro-
ceedings.
The Judge.
Odd, that the
mercantile com-
munity does not
even now seem
attracted to this
Court. You are
sure, Mr. REDBAGGE, that the inducements
which we offer to litigants are widely known?
Mr. Redbagge, Q.C. The officer of the
Court tells me, m’lud, that he has sent
round circulars to every mercantile establish-
ment in the City.
The Judge. Our scale of commissions is
surely generous enough! By the new Rules
of Court which I have made, a bonus of £500
is offered to any merchant who swears, on
affidavit, that he was about to resort to arbi-
tration but decided to come here instead.
Then I think the plan of giving his head clerk
one year's rent of his dwelling and a free
fortnight at Yarmouth for himself, and his
family, as a reward for influencing his prin-
§ºl to resort to us, was rather adroit–eh,
r. REDBAGGE *
Mr. Redbagge, Q.C. Excellent! And the
boxes of chocolate to his door-keeper, and
free tickets to the music-halls for other sub-
ordinate members of his establishment, ought
to have brought a plethora of business to this
Court.
The Judge. Quite so. Not to mention the
fact that we pay counsel's and solicitor's
fees out of public funds, instead of looking to
the litigants themselves to provide them. If
that isn't cheap justice, I should be glad to
know what is.
Mr. Redbagge (deferentially). And the
mercantile classes must surely be aware that
no Judge on the Bench has a greater know-
ledge of the law than your ludship.
The Judge (ignoring the flattery). Unfor-
tunately the mercantile classes seem also to
have a knowledge of the law, and not to like
what they know of it. So they resort to the
ruinous—I repeat, the thorºughly ruinous–
practice of arbitration.
Mr. Redbagge. It is really a serious state
of things, mºllid—forus, not for yourludship.
“Those who live to plead, must plead to live”
—and it's a little difficult to plead when–
(breaking down)—there are no clients.
The Judge (soothingly). We must think
of some other plan of attracting them, I sup-
pose. How would it beif, instead of troubling
them to come here, the Court offered to go
to their offices and sit there? Or perhaps a
few baronetcies scattered about among them
might have the desired effect. Well (rising)
as there are no cases on our list, and no
prospect of any, the Court is forced to
LINES IN PLEASANT PLACES.
ON THE ICE.
WHEN the sun was shining brightly,
When the world was gleaming whitely,
And Jack Frost held Nature tightly
In a vice,
It was joy supreme, though fleeting,
Fair AMANDA to be greeting,
When the country side was meeting
On the ice!
Happy he whom smile the Fates on,
Whom they shower tete-d-têtes on,
How I used to whip her skates on
In a trice!
And, as off we'd skim cross-handed,
Leaving all my rivals stranded,
I was glad, to be quite candid,
On the ice!
How we gave evasive answers,
When they praised our skill as dancers,
And to skate a set of lancers
Would entice;
How we thought them crude and “crocky”
#.º. to try and jockey
Into wild delights of hockey
On the ice!
To the figure-skating shilling
Snug inclosure we were willing
To subscribe—'twas cheap but thrilling
At the price:
Yet the busy scandal-riggers
With sarcastic little sniggers
Talked of people “cutting figures”
On the ice
All my heart, as I would hold her
Little hands in mine, a-smoulder–
'Twas a fact I nearly told her
Once or twice:
But, each time, what put a stopper
On my declaration proper
Was a sweet and timely cropper
On the ice!
Then the thaw came. Oh, the bother!
Oh, the words we had to smother!
Ne'er again we'll find each other
alf so nice:
Now AMANDA’s always seizing
$º. of teasing ;
Oh, she wasn't half so “freezing”

ROBERT ON COUNTY counsellins.
ME and BRowN, and sum two or three of
our most intimetfrends, has had a most liberal
offer made to us, rite in the werry art of Sent
Pancras, to go out a canwassing for the
9. Counsellers when the elections begins
shortly.
I need scarcely say as they havent made
much effect upon me
as I knows em too well
from what I hear about
em at our own Gildall
and the Manshun House,
but the terrems is sut-
tenly werry liberal, both
in refreshments and in
promisses, but they all
depends upon their suck-
cess, and from what I
hears that aint likely
to be werry great. Of
course in the grand old
Citty that wont be not
nothink, but ewen in
Sent Pancras I hears
as it wont be anythink
werry grate. I've bin
up to their own Gildall wº
at Charing. Cross again, but they does make
sitch dredful long speeches that they quite
tires, me out, and they are all about such
dredful tiresome subjecs that I soon gits
weary on em.
I was told down at Gildall that one of our
most poplar aldermen had quite made up his
mind to try and turn out the Prime Minister,
Lord RosebERRY, I think his name is, from
representing a County Council, but there must
have been sum mistake sum where, for Prime
Ministers aint exactly the sort of gents as is
ginerally selected to represent her most
gracious Majesty the QUEEN, as I spose as
the PRIME MINISTER does, and to be a County
Counseller as well. No, no, them sort of
things dont exacly go together. Our Gildall
peeple dont seem werry much alarmed about
the fuss. has has, been, made, about their
Unyfecation, as I think they calls it, which is
supposed to mean that they are all to be
turned out of Gildall, and London to be
created into one great body of Common
Counselmen! And what is to become of all
our numerous Aldermen and Deppertys, and
settera, not none of us knows a #. ! But of
course that's all nothink but mere nonsence,
that helps to keep our reel gentlemen, in
good humer. They dont seem in werry bad
sperrits, for sum of the most importentest
of em all had a grand meeting on Tuesday
last, and laid the werry fust stone of a
butiful new Manshun, werry close to Gildall,
which I am told is to cost about thirty-five
thowsand pounds, and will take a hole year
to bild, so that didn't look as if they were
T. fritened out of their wits; and just to
show the principle, gents among, em as
there wasn't not nothink to fear, the nobel
Gent as took the chair inwited amost a
hundred of em to dine with him in the
most scrumpsheous way possible, and drunk
their helths all round ! There was only
just about harf a dozen of County Counsellers
present, and they was just about as quiet as
they ginerally is when reel gents is with em.
Bhown tells me as how as he hears that
the Prince of WALEs is most strongly oposed
to the Old Citty being interfered with, and
that amost all the great House of Lords
agrees with him, so there aint much fear of
much being done, after all. Robert.

that isn't cheap justice, I should be glad to
know what is.
Mr. Redbagge (deferentially). And the
mercantile classes must surely be aware that
no Judge on the Bench has a greater know-
ledge of the law than your ludship.
The Judge (ignoring the flattery). Unfor-
tunately the mercantile classes seem also to
have a knowledge of the law, and not to like
what they know of it. So they resort to the
ruinous—I repeat, the thorºughly ruinous—
practice of arbitration.
Mr. Redbagge. It is really a serious state
of things, mlud—forus, not for yourludship.
“Those who live to plead, must plead to live”
—and it's a little difficult to plead when–
(breaking down)—there are no clients.
The Judge (soothingly). We must think
of some other plan of attracting them, I sup-
pose. How would it be if, instead of troubling
them to come here, the Court offered to go
to their offices and sit there? Or perhaps a
few baronetcies scattered about among them
might have the desired effect. Well %.

prospect of any, the Court is forced to
LINES IN PLEASANT PLACES.
ON THE ICE.
WHEN the sun was shining brightly,
When the world was gleaming whitely,
And Jack Frost held Nature tightly
In a vice,
It was joy supreme, though fleeting,
Fair AMANDA to be greeting,
When the country side was meeting
On the ice!
Happy he whom smile the Fates on,
Whom they shower tete-d-têtes on,
How I j to whip her skates on
In a trice!
And, as off we'd skim cross-handed,
Leaving all my rivals stranded,
I was glad, to be quite candid,
On the ice!
How we gave evasive answers,
When they praised our skill as dancers,
And to skate a set of lancers
Would entice;
#. we thought them#. and “crocky”
ving pairs to try and jockey
Into wild delights of hockey
On the ice!
To the figure-skating shilling
Snug inclosure we were willing -
To subscribe—'twas cheap but thrilling
At the price:
Yet the busy scandal-riggers
With sarcastic little sniggers
Talked of people “ ºutling figures”
On the ice
All my heart, as I would hold her
Little hands in mine, a-smoulder—
'Twas a fact I nearly told her
nce or twice:
But, each time, what put a stopper
On my declaration proper
Was a sweet and timely cropper
On the ice!
Then the thaw came. Oh, the bother!
Oh, the words we had to smother!
Ne'er again we’ll find each other
alf so nice:
Now AMANDA's always seizing
Opportunities of teasing;
Oh, she wasn't half so “freezing”
On the ice!

ME and BRowN, and sum two or three of
our most intimetfrends, has had a most liberal
offer made to us, rite in the werry art of Sent
Pancras, to go out a canwassing for the
9. Counsellers when the elections begins
shortly.
I need scarcely say as they havent made
much effect upon me
as I knows em too well
from what I hear about
em at our own Gildall
and the Manshun House,
but the terrems is sut-
tenly werry liberal, both
in refreshments and in
promisses, but they all
depends upon their suck-
cess, and from what I ºf
hears that aint likely
to be we great. Of
course in the grand old
Citty that wont be not
nothink, but ewen in
Sent Pancras I hears
as it wont be anythink
werry grate. I've bin
up to their own Gildall
at Charing. Cross again, but they does make
sitch dredful long speeches that they quite
tires, me out, and they are all about such
dredful tiresome subjecs that I soon gits
weary on em.
I was told down at Gildall that one of our
most poplar aldermen had quite made up his
mind to try and turn out the Prime Minister,
Lord RoseBERRY, I think his name is, from
representing a County Council, but there must
have been sum mistake sum where, for Prime
Ministers aint exactly the sort of gents as is
ginerally selected to represent her most
gracious Majesty the QUEEN, as I spose as
the PRIME MINISTER does, and to be a County
Counseller, as well. No, no, them sort of
things dont exacly go together. Our Gildall
peeple dont seem werry much alarmed about
the fuss. has has, been, made, about their
Unyfecation, as I think they calls it, which is
supposed to mean that they are all to be
turned out of Gildall, and London to be
created into one great body of Common
Counselmen! And what is to become of all
our numerous Aldermen and Deppertys, and
settera, not none of us knows a bit l But of
course that’s all nothink but mere nonsence,
that helps to keep our reel gentlemen, in
good humer. They dont seem in werry bad
sperrits, for sum of the most importentest
of em all had a grand meeting on Tuesday
last, and laid the werry fust stone...of a
butiful new Manshun, werry close to Gildall,
which I am told is to cost about thirty-five
thowsand pounds, and will take a hole year
to bild, so that didn't look as if they were
T. fritened out of their wits; and just to
show the principle, gents among, em as
there wasn't not nothink to fear, the nobel

just about harf a dozen of County Counsellers

they ginerally is when reel gents is with em.
Bhown tells me as how as he hears that
the Prince of WALEs is most strongly oposed
to the Old Citty being interfered with, and
that amost all the great House of Lords
agrees with him, so there aint much fear of

Who should have shone as fame's fixed star!
Unwelcome loss, when sons of light
So few and so infrequent are.
To flare athwart the startled sky,
A prodigy portentous, fills
The vision of the vulgar eye,
The common soul with wonder thrills.
And much of meteoric glare
Seemed herald of that steadier course,
Which, drawing less the general stare,
Spoke to the wise of light and force.
Now all’s extinct in early gloom,
Eclipsed in shadow premature.
A brilliant soul, a bitter doom!
And who shall read with judgment sure
The secret of the light that failed,
The mystery of the fallen star?
Though whilom worshippers have railed,
Though clingers to the conqueror's car
Reviled a vanquished victor's name,
The brightness of that brief career
Defies the dullards who defame,
Confounds the incompetents who sneer.
But yesterday, in sooth it seems,
The promise of the platform's pride
Inspired a Party's youthful dreams,
And filled to flood their hope's high tide.
Now all is hushed,—save the sad voice

SIR,--I have recently seen letters and para-
graphs in various newspapers instigating
travellers going abroad to choose the Folke-
stone and Boulogne route instead of going
riá Dover and Calais. I forget what particu-
lar reasons are given for advocating this
substitution, nor do I care what they are or
what they may be. Why? Because, first,
undeniably viá Dover to Calais is the shortest
route, and to those of BRITANNIA's sons and
daughters-gallant islanders all—who detest
the sea as much as does the humble individual
who now addresses you, the saving of twenty
minutes or half an hour, or in some instances
it may be even more, of the sea-passage would
be well worth any extra expense ſt extra ex-
pense there be, which, an’ remember
rightly, is not the case), especially when aboard
such steam-vessels as are now provided;
though, be the steam-vessels what they may,
there is still in one and all of them that
peculiar flavour and motion about which I
would rather not speak, or even think, lest I
should be unable to finish this importantletter.
But there is yet another reason why the
Dover and Calais route is the best of all ways
to the Continent, and that is on account of
the excellent déjeuner—still, as I believe,
unequalled at any port or at any station in
Europe–served to the many r hungry
and thirsty travellers quickly, hotly, and as
comfortably as the já bustling cir-
cumstances of travel will permit. the
railway company which takes us to Paris
cannot give us three quarters of an hour for
our very necessary, toilette (after the sea

For those who value their digestions, and

there is but one route to Paris from London,
and that is viá, Calais, i.e. viár the buffet.
Only, cher messieurs les directeurs de la ligne

tend our luncheon-time at Calais to just
three quarters of an hour, instead of giving
us only a beggarly twenty-five minutes at
best, and do É. thing well while you are

DELIGHTFUL reminiscences are these of GEORGE AUGUSTU's SALA's,

All the notabilities of his
earlier days were mentioned
in that poem, at least so I
believe, for does it not belong
to a date when the Baron
had not come within measur-
able distance of his title
- when he watched the great
guns from afar with awe; when he saw them in the Cyder
Cellars and, at Evans's, bºth of which night resorts he, having
been first taken there by a kindly but injudicious man-about-town,
subsequently, patronised on , such holidays as were offered to
him by the jovial nights after the Eton and Harrow matches at
Lord's, and on the eve, of such a festival as the University Boat
Race. The Baron in those happy days and nights was attired in
the costume in, which RICHART. Doyle has dressed young Clive
Newcome when he sº his father, the Colonel, on that ever
memorable evening to The Cave of Harmony, and heard the song
that made him so wrathful. There are no Cyder Cellars, Coal Holes,
and Evans's nowadays, which owlish resorts were strictly restricted
to the use of the male, sex, young and old. But even if a kind
considerate legislature does insist on extinguishing the lights, and
turning us outin the streets at 12.30 precisely, are morality and health
so very much benefited by the process? Isn'titcheerful to read of the
pleasantly convivial late hours in the Georgian Augustan Era? The

Mr. G. A. S. at p. 310, vol. ii. Inter alia, the autobiographist is
correct in saying that MADIsox MoRTox's Bor and Cor was con-
cocted from Une Chambre di Deua Lits “and another French
farce,” of which, as he doesn't give the name, the Baron will here
'take the liberty ºf mentioning it. It was a farce with music, that
is to say a comédie-vauderille en un acte, written by Messrs. LA-
BICHE and LEFRANC, and produced at the Palais-Royal in 1846. Its
name was Frisette. Bor and Coz was produced in 1847 at the
Lyceum. Very little furniture for the English farce was taken from
Une Chambre di Deua Lits, but packages of dialogue were handed
in to Boz and Cor from Frisette. THE BARON DE B.-W.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
By the publication of The Play Actress more
(S. R. CRoCKETT) Mr. FishER UN win fully
maintains the success attained by his Auto-
nym Library. My Baronite is least attracted
by the scenes, which possibly pleased the
anthor most—those in which he describes life
in the purlieus of London theatres. Mr.
CRoCKETT is much more at home in Galloway,
and with the people who sparsely populate it.
The opening chapter, describing Sabbath day
in the Kirk of the Hill is in his best style,
as are others flºº the Great Preacher's
tender caring for his little grand-daughter.
The Play Actress is just the sort of thing
to buy at a bookstall on starting for a jour-
ney. It will be felt to be a matter of regret
if the journey, isn't quite long enough to
finish it at a sitting.
In The Worst Woman in London (“and
other stories,” a subtitle craftily suppressed
on the outside of the book by F. C. PHILIPs)
the author gives us a number of capital
detached stories of a most irritating abrupt-
ness. Almost every one of these stories is a
novel thrown away; that is, every story is in
itself the germ of what might have been a
good novel. They are little more than “jot-
tings for plottings.” ...Yet, to be read with a
pipe or small cigar, they just suffice to wile
away time and obviate conversation. They
are dedicated to Mr. WALTER HERRIEs Pol-
Lock, who has on more than one occasion
shown himself an adept at real good short
stories—not merely as plots, but genuinely
complete in themselves and full of humour—

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
DELIGHTFUL reminiscences are these of GEORGE AUGUSTU's SALA's,
told in his own peculiar rattling-off, running-on, one-anecdote-
down-t'other-come-on style. Of all “people he has met” he has plenty
to say, but nil nisi bonum ; all writ with a magnum-b num pen.
Once he was a “Gipsy King,
ha! hal” but, long ago, as
he tells us, he renounced all
claims to the throne of Bo-
hemia, abdicated, retired,
and, no more a Rad, has led
§ a Reformed Club life. Who
§ wrote the burlesque Eugene
Aram verses, ending with,
\ “And George Augustus
walked before,
With gyves upon his wrist”?
All the notabilities of his
earlier days were mentioned
in that poem, at least so I
believe, for does it not belong
to a date when the Baron
had not come within measur-
able distance of his title
- when he watched the great
guns from afar with awe; when he saw them in the Cyder
Cellars and, at Evans's, both of which night resorts he, having
been first taken there by a kindly but injudicious man-about-town,
subsequently patronised on such holidays as were offered to
him by the jovial nights after the Eton and Harrow matches at
Lord's, and on the eve of such a festival as the University Boat
Race. The Baron in, those happy days and nights was attired in
the costume in which RICHARD | Doyle has dressed young Clive
Newcome when he *::Fº his father, the Colonel, on that ever
memorable evening to The Caye of Harmony, and heard the song
that made him so wrathful. There are no Cyder Cellars, Coal Holes,
and Evans's nowadays, which owlish resorts were strictly restricted
to the use of the male, sex, young and old. But even if a kind
considerate legislature does insist on extinguishing the lights, and
turning us out in the streets at 12.30 precisely, are morality and health
so very much benefited by the process? Isn'titcheerful to read of the
pleasantly convivial late hours in the Georgian Augustan Era? The
celebrities at home and abroad, that he knew were legion, and I'll
be bound (as the Book said) that he hasn't emptied his memory
stores by many a cupboard full. There is one sentiment which
hugely—it is GeoRGE AUGUSTus's rightºus denunciation of “the
unjust and iniquitous, income-tax,” The Baron, says ditto, to
Mr. G. A. S. at p. 310, vol. ii. Inter alia, the autobiographist is
correct in saying that MADIsox MoRTON's Boz and Cor was con-
cocted from Une Chambre di Deua Lits “and another French
farce,” of which, as he doesn't give the name, the Baron will here
take the liberty ºf mentioning it. It was a farce with music, that
is to say a comédie-vauderille en un acte, written by Messrs. LA-
BICHE and LEFRANC, and produced at the Palais-Royal in 1846. Its
name was Frisette. Bor and Coz was produced in 1847 at the
Lyceum. Very little furniture for the English farce was taken from
Une Chambred Deua Lits, but packages of dialogue were handed
in to Boz and Coa: from Frisette. THE BARON DE B.-W.

I am in the last stage of bron-

and a friend has advised me to
try, the new French cure of
applying ice to the spine. Will
some ob lºs physician tell me
whether considers such a
course safe?. None but a recog-
nised specialist need trouble to
reply; and if he does so, I shall
have the satisfaction of feeling
that I have saved his fee, as
well as my own life. My bo
advises me to go skating, an
“I shall be sure then to have
my back applied to the ice,”
which he says is the same thing
as applying ice to my back.
But is it?'. A nephew who is
staying in the house also kindly
offers to “shy hard snow-balls
at my spine,” if that would help
me in any way. It is a pity
that the newspaper (from *}.
I derived this medical hint) was
not clear as to details; for

the ice, what is to prevent its

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
By the publication of The Play Actress
(S. R. CRoCKETT) Mr. FISHER UNw1N fully
maintains the success attained by his Auto-
nym Library. My Baronite is least attracted
by the scenes, which possibly pleased the
anthor most—those in which he describes life
in the purlieus of London theatres. Mr.
CRoCKETT is much more at home in Galloway,
and with the people who sparsely populate it.
The opening chapter, describing Sabbath day
in the Kirk of the Hill is in his best style,
as are others describing the Great Preacher's
tender caring for his little fº.º.
The Play Actress is just the sort of thing
to buy at a bookstall on starting for a jour-
ney. It will be felt to be a matter of regret
if the journey isn't quite long enough to
finish it at a sitting.
In The Worst Woman in London (“and
other stories,” a subtitle craftily suppressed
on the outside of the book by F. C. {}.
the author gives us a number of capital
detached stories of a most irritating abrupt-
ness. Almost every one of these stories is a
novel thrown away; that is, every story is in
itself the germ of what might have been a
good novel. They are little more than “jot-
tings for plottings.” ...Yet, to be read with a
pipe or small cigar, they just suffice to wile
away time and obviate conversation. They
are dedicated to Mr. WALTER HERRIEs Pol-
Lock, who has on more than one occasion
shown himself an adept at real good short
stories—not merely as plots, but genuinely
complete in themselves and full of humour—
and from whom the Baron expects something
more in the same line, or, rather, on the
same lines. THE BARON DE B.-W.

THE Daily Graphic of February 1, commenting on the time-con-

ing press-cuttings:–
From the “Magazine of Art.”
The Directors of the Aquarium are to be congratulated on their
new d-parture, which takes the form of a highly exciting and sports-
imanlike contest between those two well-known entertainers Professor
|HERR KomER and Señor HARDLI DUDDI in their great poster-paint-
ing exhibition. This consists of a trial of strength and endurance,
the challenger, Señor DUDDI, having given out that he will beat Pro-
fessor KoMER's previous record in time and area combined by one
hour and a hundred square yards. As the public are well aware, the
latter performer's sensational achievement, “Miss Letty Lind,”
stands at present unbeaten as an artistic poster, having far eclipsed
his “ All Beautiful in Naked Purity,” which attracted such
attention on the Royal Academy hoardings last year. As to time, his
LIND tour de force (shown at the Society of Portrait Painters at the
New Gallery last autumn) was painted in one continuous whirl or
sitting of fifty hours duration, and would have taken even longer,
had not the accomplished danseuse fainted from exhaustion. (It is
understood, by the way, that Miss LIND has issued a challenge that
she will pirouette against the world, including Lord YARMouth and
Little Tich.) -
Señor DUDDI has hitherto, made his mark with presentments of
de’ails as to the time in which they were designed, but we should
think about twenty minutes on an average.
As the Aquarium contest will not be concluded until after we go
to press, we cannot give the result, but at the time of writing, after
three days’ painting without cessation, Mr. KoMER had covered a
quarter of an acre of canvas, while Mr. DUDDI had traversed three
hundred yards of advertisement, hoarding. Both were going well
and strong, the only people showing signs of exhaustion being the
umpires and spectators.
From the “Sporting Times.”
What will our dear friends of the Anti-Sporting League say to
this? Here's yet another form of iniquity, the Poet Stakes at the
Aquarium ! e looked in last night at that classic abode, and
found them all hard at it in the Bijou Theatre. We soon made a
pretty book, and only regret we hadn't entered BALLYHooLY and Doss
CHIDFRDoss. A black-haired colt was making the pace with what he
called “beautiful prose music,” quite as good as any we turn out in
our first page. But the backers rather fancied a Chestnut Pegasus,
who was going well within his stride with his “Odes and Poems.”
There were one or two other dark horses in the field, that we put
down for a place. That worthy and veteran sportsman, and cutest
of tipsters, G. ALLEN, wielded the flag, and got his little lot off, as
we were told, with only ten false starts. . We left at the fifty-
seventh hour, when the leaders had completed two hundred and
twenty laps of very blank verse and other paces, it being a go-as-
you-please contest. A sonnet divided the first and second, and
there was an º and a half between the second and the third.

de'ails as to the time in which they were designed, but we should
think about twenty minutes on an average.
As the Aquarium contest will not be concluded until after we go
to press, we cannot give the result, but at the time of writing, after
three days’ painting without cessation, Mr. KoMER had covered a
quarter of an acre of canvas, while Mr. DUDDI had traversed three
hundred yards of advertisement hoarding. Both were going well
and strong, the only people showing signs of exhaustion being the
umpires and spectators.

called “beautiful prose music,” quite as good as any we turn out in

who was going well within his stride with his “Odes and Poems.”
There were one or two other dark horses in the field, that we put
down for a place. That worthy and veteran sportsman, and cutest

we were told, with only ten false starts. . We left at the fifty-

the physical configuration of the country through which we should
have to pass, the height of its various mountains, the depth of its
valleys, the breadth and current of its rivers, its capacity for food
supply, and the nature of its inhabitants. Having done all this, I
spare the reader unnecessary details. It would profit him but
little if I were to set down exactly the equipment, the clothing, the
arms, and all the other preparations †† my matchless experience
prompted me to make. Such an expedition as that which I was
about to §: in can never be undertaken again, for the simple
reasons that there are now no pink hippopotami in the world, and
that improved methods of communication, ridiculous railways,
absurd º preposterous telephones, an
ludicrously well-metalled roads have robbed life,
even in Seringapatam, of all the romance which, in
my younger days, cast a halo of adventure round
the smallest undertaking. How gloriously we
revelled, how grandly we fought, how magnificently
contemptuous we were of danger! But now we
clothe ourselves in patent wool, we tremble at the
shadow of a policeman, we judge everything by the
mean standard of its money value. Some day we
shall awake from our dreams of false security, when
the crash of invasion sounds in our ears, and we see
our homesteads ruthlessly trampled down by the
hoof of some despised and foreign foe. Then, when
it is too late, the public will remember that England
still possesses one great leader inured to hardship
and danger from his earliest youth, one whom,
though a perverse Parliament has slighted him, the
reatest warriors and the gallantest sportsmen have
n proud to salute as their unquestioned superior.
I shall answer to the call with what strength. I may
still possess, and my prematurely grizzled hair shall
be seen waving in the van of my country's defenders;

he was eminently fitted to help me in those perilous situations in
which I had no doubt we should find ourselves before the adventure
was over and the task performed. It was not his fault that he
lacked those brilliant powers of initiative, that wonderful ingenuity
of resource for which I had already become famous. But one genius
of that kind is sufficient in any adventure, and I knew that for
courage, strength, and bulldog tenacity, I could reckon on GANDER-
| Down to the death.
We fixed our start for a Thursday, always a lucky day for any
expedition in which I have been engaged. I gave GANDERDown

Answer. A small sum of
money would be necessary to
purchase a broom—a prelimi-
nary step that could not be
surmounted.
Q. Quite so. And would a
like difficulty arise to prevent
you selling lucifers?
A. Certainly, for matches
suitable for street hawking
cannot be obtained on credit.
Q. Would a clerkship be
within your reach?
A. Scarcely, as a new suit,
or a nearly new suit of clothes
would be requisite to give one
the air of respectability neces-
sary for securing an audience
with an employer.
Q. Could you not become a
company promoter P
A. Not with safety, now
that the winding-up business
is superintended by a judge
capable of understanding the
intricacies of city finance.
Q. Is there any opening for
you as a cab-driver?
No, as a license cannot
be obtained for love, but must
be bought with money.
Q. Surely you have a chance
as a slave to journalism?
A. Writing for the press is
at all times precarious, and is,
moreover, a calling which can-
not be followed without a
small but impossible expendi-
ture on pens, ink, and paper.

“TEMPORA MUTANTUR.”—
In these days of very late
dining hours a performance at
5 P.M., if over at 7, or 7.15 at
latest, ought to suit those
whose daily work is over about
4or 4.30, and whodislike “turn-
ing out” after dinner if they
are at home, and who cannot
get away from any dinner
party if they are out in time
to see even Half of the enter-
tainment. The matinée at two
is a very difficult time, as it
clashes with lunch; but as tea
can be taken in the entr’actes,
five o'clock seems a very rea-
sonable hour, that is, if the
show be over at 7.15, and the
dinner hour be 8 or 8.15.
HINTS TO-SKATERS ON ETIQUETTE AND DEPORTMENT.
Do not venture on the ice until you can skate properly. Practice
the various steps and evolutions before a looking-glass in your bed-
room.
There is a great art in falling gracefully, and it is surprising what
a number of interesting, complicated, and unlooked-for attitudes and
figures can be thus developed. To ensure perfect confidence at the
critical moment, it is as well to hire somebody, say a professional
wrestler or prize-fighter, to trip you up and knock you down in all
the possible methods. A mattress may be used for beginners to fall
on. The more improbable your manner of tumbling, the greater
success will you achieve in the eyes of the on-lookers.
When skating with a lady, you may cross hands, but it is unusual
for you to put your arm round her waist. This is only done in great
emergencies, or in a thick fog, or when you have the pond to your-
selves. It is generally found that this proceeding is equivalent to
skating on verythin ice, and will lead to dangerous consequences.
If, however, a lady, who evidently has not complete control of her-
self, and does not readily answer her helm, steers straight into your
arms, you should accept the situation in your best ball-room manner.
Do not attempt to avoid a collision, as if you dodge suddenly, the
lady, on failing to meet your support, will probably sit down
abruptly on the ice, or get entangled with a sweeper.
Should you, owing to any unforeseen circumstance, find yourself
F. at a youn º feet, do not place your hand on your
eart and say she is the only girl you ever loved. These little scenes
are apt to collect a crowd. Merely say you stopped to examine the
thickness of the ice, or any little plaisanterie you feel capable of in-
venting. Then retire to a discreet distance and rub yourself.
If the ice gives way, and you find yourself in the water, get out as
speedily as possible. I do not advise drowning. It is always a wet
and uncomfortable process, and has very few recommendations. It
is, moreover, quite fatal to true enjoyment, and only those who are
morbidly anxious for a “par” in the papers will habitually resort to
this mode of creating a sensation.
Do not hit people much with any stick you may think it de rigueur
to brandish about. . Such personal attentions are best performed
when you and a string of ten or twelve other 'Arries are banded
together.
You can then stand up
without fear for the rights of the
high-spirited young citizen to enjoy himself.
There is nothing that figure-skaters so much appreciate as the
sudden inroad of hockey-players in their midst. It adds immensely
to their zest to feel they are liable to be knocked over in the middle
of an exciting “rocker” or "
‘moh
awk”; and, of course, they like
their combined figures to be nicely disarranged, as it enables them to
show their skill in sorting themselves again. Hockey should there-
fore be indulged in anywhere and everywhere.
Lastly, if you prefer sliding to skating, do not slide in a top-hat
and frock-coat, unless you are a member of the Skating Club, and
even then it looks ostentatious.

ANIMAL SAGACITY.
DEAR SIR,--I desire to draw your atten-
tion to what I think I may fairly describe as
a wonderful instance of animal sagacity.
During the recent severe frosta large number
of birds and rabbits were fed every day in
my garden. On Friday, for the first time, I
noticed a fine hare, which, from its appear-
ance, evidentiy felt the cold bitterly, ºffed
it, but *** set in, an by its
suffering (for I have a kind heart) I took it
into the kitchen. Half-an-hour afterwards
the cook came to tell me that the kitchen-
maid was in hysterics. I went down and
found out the reason—the girl had been
frightened, when taking up a large jug
which stood on the ground, to find the hare
in it! The hare, poor, thing, preferred a
warm death to a cold existence, but,
denied the possibility of human speech,
had taken this graphic way of indicating
its wishes. I have only to add that they
were respected at dinner yesterday.

LITTLE MOPSEMAN.
• THE THIRD ACT.
An eleration and rockery in FRüYSECK's back-garden, from which
—but for the houses in between—an extensire view over the
steamer-pier and flord could be obtained. In front, a summer-
house, covered with creepers and wild earwigs. On a bench out-
side, MoPSA is sitting. She has the inevitable little travelling-
bag on a strap over %r shoulder. Bloch DRAHN comes up in the
dusk. He, too, has a travelling-bag, made of straw, containing
professional implements, over #. shoulder. He is carrying a
rolled-up handbill and a small paste-pot.

on the summer-house...To offer a reward for Little MopsáMAN,

the paste-pot.) But you'll
see—he'll never turn up.
Mopsa (sighing). Poor

don't know if I can have

Mopsa. I tried that once—with ALFRED. It didn't quite answer—
though it was delightful, all the same.
San. Eng. Bloch. Then there really has been a bright and happy
time in your life? I should never have suspected it!
Mopsa. Oh yes, you can't think how amusing. ALFRED was in
those days. When he distinguished himself by failing to pass his
examinations, and then, from time to time, when he ‘. #. post
in some school or other, or when his big, bulky manuscripts were

San. Eng. Bloch. Yes, I can quite see that such an existence must
have had its moments of quiet merriment. (Shaking his head.) But

Mopsa (with suppressed emotion). The Law of Change. Our latest
catchphrase, you know. ALFRED is so subject to it. So will you
be, some day or other
San, Eng. Bloch. Never in all my life ; whatever progress may be
made in sanitation! (Insistently.) Can't you really care for me?
Mopsa, I might—(looking down)—if you have no objection to go
halves with ALFRED.
San. Eng. Bloch. I am behind the times, I daresay; but such an
arrangement does not strike me as a firm basis for a really happy
house. I should certainly object to it, most decidedly.

San. Eng. Bloch. Yes, Mrs. FRüysECE asked me to.
Alfred (touched). Then she does miss Little MoPs; MAN, after all!

comes to that! (Oppressed—to himself). My troll is...at it again!
I shall press her to stay—I know I shall—and it will end in the
usual way!
Spreta (comes up the steps, plaintively). It is unkind of you all to

Mopsa, No; it was only

We’ve only just time to catch the steamer.
Mopsa. Then, thanks so much for a quite too delightful visit,

subdued anguish.) I am running away—from you! I entreat you

Sit down and I will tell it you.

the mountains, ALFRED, when you lost your way and couldn't find a
policeman anywhere about the peaks? Because I’ve heard that-
and I don't think I can stand it again.
Alfred (coldly and bitterly). You see that I have really nothing to
fill up my life with, when my own wife refuses to listen to my anec-
dotes! Now MoPSA always— What is all that barking down
there in the town?
Spreta (with an outburst). Oh, you’ll see, they’ve found Little
MoPsièMAN!
Alfred. Not they. He'll never be found. Those handbills of
yours were a mere waste of money. It is only the curs fighting in
the street—as usual.
Spreta (slowly, and with resolution). Only that, ALFRED. And do
you know what f mean to do, as soon as you are away solitudinising
up there in the mountain hotels? I will go down and bring all those
poor neglected dogs home with me.
Alfred (uneasily). What—the whole lot of them, SPRETAP

MAN's place. They shall dig up his bones, lie on his mat, take it, in

their lot in life.
Alfred (with growing uneasiness). When you simply detest all
dogs! I don’t know anyone less fitted than you to manage a Dog's
Home. I really don't!
Spreta. I must fill the void in my life somehow—if you go and
leave me. And I must educate myself to understand dogs better,
that's all.
Alfred. Yes, that you would have to do. (As if struck with an
idea.) Before you begin. Suppose I take up my big fat book on
Canine Idiosyncrasy once more, eh? That would teach you how to

Spreta (with a melancholy smile). I am in no hurry ALFRED.
Only to write that you would have to remain at home.
Alfred (half erasively). Not necessarily. I might, of course—for
a while, that is. But I shall have many a heavy day of work before
me, SPRETA, and you will see, now and then perhaps, a great slum-
berous peace descend on me as Itoil away in my brown study—but I

“JUST the weather for receiving a sharp

with his snow-boots on. Naturally his frien
wished to know why... “Because,” replied
Dr. CHUCKLER, “with the temperature below
zero, no one can object to having a wrap over

TOBY TO H.R.H.
[A propos of cropping dogs' ears, a letter from
Sir F. KNoLLYs appeared last week in the Stock-
Keeper, informing an inquirer that H.R.H. had
never allowed any dog of his to be “mutilated,”
and was pleased to hear that “owners of dogs had
agreed to abandon so objectionable a practice.”]

MUSICAL NoTE.—The title of a song, “Come
where the Booze is Cheaper,” has become
widely known owing to a recent trial. We

thus be elevated not only to the
supreme command of the British
forces, but also to the throne of

vated, as I was, by the tender
maidenly loveliness of CHUDDAH,
and the wicked old woman had
sworn to have her revenge. I
ad, of course, a staunch ally in
her brother, the MEEBHoy, but in
his disabled condition, that vete-
ran warrior could be of little real
use to me. Still he knew of m
love for his niece CHUDDAH, and,
knowing all my worth, he had
already consecrated with his bless-
ing our prospective union. On this
particular evening I found Chud-
DAH in her cosy little boudoir
alone, save for the §. of her
stout and comfortable old Ayah or
Nana. The darling girl sprang up
as I entered the room and threw
herself into my arms in a passion
of affection. I gently disengaged
her arms from about my neck,
and proceeded, as best I could, to
inform her that I had come to take
leave of her for a short time. Her
grief was terrible to witness.
“Oh, my own!” she sobbed (I

I ought to mention that the Ranee, the aunt of my darling
CHUDDAH, was as susceptible as she was haughty and ferocious.
During my stay in the capital I had had several interviews with her,
and I could not disguise from myself—why should I?—that she re-
Indeed, she had taken the
somewhat extreme step of informing me semi-officially (so that she
might afterwards, if necessary, be at liberty to disavow it) that, if I
would only consent to marry her, she would undertake to poison Sir

“Hist!
very, very own, my tall and gorgeously beautiful son of the fair-faced
English, my moon of radiant splendour, my star of aspiring hope,

Duffadar, for CHUDDAH cannot bear it.”
“But, my darling,” I urged, “duty calls, and CHUDDAH would
not have her ORLANDo flinch.”
The beautiful girl admitted the force of this appeal and a renewed
scene of affectionate leave-taking took

We did so, alarmed by the impressive air of the good old nurse.

under my feet.
“I suspect treachery,” con-
tinued the Ayah hurriedly.
“'Twas only yester morn I saw
YoUBYoUB scowling at us as we

This Youbyoub, I ought to say,
was the young and bloodthirsty
Prince of the Lozen Jehs, a tribe
of wild warriors from the north.
Betrothed to the beautiful CHUD-
DAH at an early age, he natur-
ally viewed with hatred the advent
of one on whom nature had be-
stowed her favours so bountifully,
and who was bound, therefore, to
make himself dear to CHUDDAH.
I knew he detested me, but I had
hitherto scorned him, I was now
to discover my mistake.
Scarcely had the words left the
Ayah's lips when a loud rumbling
made itself heard: the floor seemed
to heave in one terrific crash,
there was a horrible explosion,
and before I had time to realise
what had happened we three,
ChuddAH, the Ayah and I, were

in view of circumstance that ELLIS ASHMEAD-BARTLETT (Knight)–
what was it GRANDolph said about mediocrity with double-barrelled
names?—would appear in his new character as SILOMI9. Title con-
ferred during recess by delegates from Swaziland. Curiosity
quickened by report that début would be made in character.

picturesque, but with nine degrees of frost in Palace Yard a little

Even in commonplace English dress SILoM10 made a striking figure
as he stood at the table, and belaboured it for “Swaziland, my
Swaziland.”. Looked at times as if he were going to leap over,
and seize by the throat Sydney Buxton provokingly smiling on the
other side. Last week's handkerchief hanging out from his coat tail
pocket, in liberal measure though crumpled state, lent a weird
effect to back view, not interrupted by inconvenient crowding
on front Opposition Bench. Odd how SILoMIo's colleagues in late
Ministry find business elsewhere when he rises to orate.
Business done.—Talking round Address.
Thursday:-Rather painful scene in House to-night., CHAPLIN
resuming debate on Address led its course gently by the still waters of
bimetallism. Somehow
that a subject that has
never quite entranced
attention of frivolous
Commons. It works
certain subtle spell
upon them. At clink
of sovereign and shil-
ling between argu-
mentative finger and
thumb they slink away.
So it was to-night
whilst CHAPLIN spoke.
Faithful among the
faithless found was
JEMMY Lowth ER. He
sat attentive beside the
orator with an expres-
sion of profound wis-
dom, unmitigated by
boyish habit of keeping
his hands in his trouse
pocket, not withou
suspicion of furtively
counting his marbles, or
attempting to open his
knife with the fingers
of one hand.

intervals, suffered it up to the end. The other rode in triumphantly
from York one July day in 1865. Thus their united Parliamentary
have, through all this time, resisted attacks on British Constitution.
i. suddenly, publicly, in eye of the scorner, came sharp parting of
e ways. -
CHAPLIN viewing state of things depressing industrial communities
admitted it was very bad. Mills closed, mines empty, º:
yards silent, workmen starving. Only one thing would save the
State—Bimetallism. “Is there anyone,” said the orator with mag-
nificent wave of arm round desolate benches; “who has, any other
suggestion to make for the salvation of these industries?” Then up
spoke JEMMY LowTHER. “I have,” he said with final tug at the
blade of the knife hidden in his pºcket.
CHAPLIN stood aghast. , Could it be possible—his own, familiar
friend?. He turned, looked down on him, gasping for breath. , Then
in a hollow yoice he added, “What has my right hon, friend been
doing all this time? Why doesn't he make his proposal?” -
. Here was an opening for apology, recantation, or at least, submis-
sive silence. But JEMMY evidently gone to the bad; got the bit
between his teeth and bolted. “I’ve made it over and over again,”
he growled, thinking resentfully of his much crying in the wilderness
for that blessed thing Protection. Ribald House roared with
laughter. , CHAPLIN, cut to heart, avoided repetition of painful in-
cident by bringing oration to early conclusion.
“Let’s put this matter to practical test, Toby,” he said. “Come
along with me, and we’ll consult the Unemployed.”
Not far to go. Qn Westminster Bridge a hollow-cheeked man
leaning over low wall stared at ice-floes silently gliding down with
the tide, “My good man,” said CHAPLIN, “you look unemploved,
and I daresay you're hungry. ...Now, in order to put yºu, straight,
which would you rather have, Bimetallism or Protection?”
“Well, if you don't mind.
master,” said the Unemployed
huskily, “I’d like a chunk o'
bread.”
“Ah!” - said CHAPLIN,
“these people are so *::::::

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE 0. W. WADE MEGUM.
Question. Is it easy to be-
come a dramatist P
Answer. As easy as any-
thing else.
Q. What are the requisites?
A. A West-end theatre, a
first-rate troupe of artists, a
train d audience, and a per-
sonalitv.
Q. What do you mean by a
trained audience?
A. An assembly accustomed
to tº: everything as wit,
and to ſaugh at anything.
Q. Would such a fº.
consider it amusing for some-
one to say “Flirting with one's
husband is quite indelicate:
it is like washing one's clean
linen in public " ?
A. Certainly ; and would
find much to admire in a dia-
logue given over for something
like ten minutes to an exhaus-
tive consideration of muffins.
Q. And what do you mean
by a personality?
A. More or less—an insou-
ciunt manner, and a rather
startling button-hole.
Q. Does the personality re-
quire a speech or a cigarette?
A. Neither now, as both
have ceased to be the fashion.
Q. Given the requisites you
have specified for creating a
dramatist, what is the pro-
duct
A. A trivial comedy for
serious people.
Q. Why give a play such a
title?
A. Why not?
Q. Can a comedy occupying

º
two or three hours in repre-
sentation be entirely trivial?
A. Not to the members of
the audience.
Q. And are they serious
people?
º That depends upon the
condition of their brains and
their capacity of enjoyment.
Q. Does the trivial comedy
require a plot?
4. Nothing to speak of.
Q. Or characterisation?
A. No, for the same kind of
dialogue will do for all the
company—for London ladies,
country girls, justices of the
peace, doctors of divinity,
maid-servants, and confiden-
tial butlers.
Q. What sort of dialogue?
A. Inverted proverbs and
renovated paradoxes.
Q. Is this kind of dialogue
entirely new
A. §. entirely, as some-
thing rather like it has been
heard at the Savoy for the last
ten or twenty years.
Q. But is it good enough
for a British Public?
A. Quite good enough.
They will laugh when a
London lady expresses sur-
rise at finding flowers grow-
ing in the country, and roar
when they hear the retort,
that plants are as common in
the provinces as people intown.
º But surely this vein of
sarcasm, satire, or whatever
it is, will some day be worked
out. What can the dramatist
then do?
A. Act upon precedent, and
try something else.
TONING IT DOWN.

JAPANESE WFRsion.
EARLY on Tuesday a severe
engagement took place between
the Japanese Fleet and the Chi-
nese Flotilla, in which the Chinese
ironclads Wi Ho Wi, Bang Tel
Bang, and Bosh Lu Rot were
sunk. The loss on the Japanese
side was a cabin-boy wounded.
The Chinese prisoners amounted
to 180,000 men.
On Wednesday morning the
Japanese landed and took all the
forts, and garrisoned the city,
which is now completely in the
hands of the troops of the
Taicoon.
On Thursday the Japanese
commenced a general bombard-
ment of the island, and blew up
all the forts, and sixty-seven
Fº magazines. The Chinese
oss is estimated at 36,000 men.
The Japanese escaped unscathed.
On Friday the Japanese made
their grand attack and took the
CHINESE WERSION.
THE Chinese Fleet gave a good
account of the Japanese Squadron
on Tuesday. The slaughter of
the Japs was enormous, amount-
ing to at least 40 000 sailors and
50,000 marines. There was no
loss on the Chinese side. Owing
to a mistake the Wi Ho Wi lost
a rope, the Bang. Tel Bang had
her figure-head slightly damaged
and the Bosh in Roi re-entered
port, just to have her deck
repainted. The Japanese lost
several ironclads and all their
torpedo-boats.
On Wednesday an attack of
70,000 Japanese troops was re-
pulsed, with great slaughter by
the Chinese, and the invaders are
now in active retreat. The Chi-
nese have not pursued them, from
motives of an entirely philan-
thropic character.
An artillery duel took place on
Thursday, between the Chinese
tº. and the Japanese, in which
the latter lost all their war ma-
teriel and seventy-nine general
officers. The casualty on the
Chinese side was one drummer-
boy slightly wounded-sprain of
the left little toe.
For a few minutes the Japanese
secured a footing on the island,
island by assault, and destroyed
all the enemy's fleet, with the
exception of a gun-boat.
The Chinese Fleet on Saturday
was entirely at the mercy of the
Japanese, and the Admiral is
soliciting for terms. A flag of
truce is floating from the re-
maining Chinese ironclad.
On Sunday the Japanese con-
sented to permit the Chinese
Admiral and sailors to uncon-
ditionally surrender, and have
arranged to protect them from
the fury of the Chinese Govern-
ment.
but were soon induced to retreat.
Many of the Chinese ironclads
have seen much service, but are
still able to dispose of the enemy.
The Chinese Admiral during
Saturday has wired to his Gov-
ernment—“The Japanese, after
one slight reverse, having lost all
heart, are now suing for peace.
we shall be careful to guard the
best interests of the empire.”
The Chinese Admiral (under
Sunday's date) has wired to Pekin
—“Have come to arrangement
with Japanese authorities. Shall
not return to Pekin. Good-bye.
Those who have no other engage-
ments are going home to tea.”

Not the Learned Pig, ladies and gentlemen, this time. Oh dear
no! I should think the public had had about enough of him for
some time to come, and— Oh, I forgot! (Aside: He'll have to
be trotted out again presently, so I’d better shut up, and not spoil
the market for Misther O'MoRLEY.) As I was saying, ladies and
gentlemen, not the Learned Irish Pig, but the Learned Welsh Goat
A goat, you know, is a nimble creature, which, in a state of
nature, mounts, pinnacles, and leaps from rock to rock, like the poor
gentleman in the Contrabandista. This one could climb a church
steeple, and balance itself on the weathercock—if permitted to do so.
Couldn't you, TAFFY P (Aside : I hope the blessed brute won't butt
me. He’s been a bit restive of late.) -
No, ladies and gentlemen, Esmeralda's goat was really not in it
with mine, for nimbleness and nous, much less the goat in Dinorah.
As to Rcbinson Crusoe's much talked of animal— Here, I say,

That means, “Mind your “p's' and ‘q’s’,”, ladies and gentlemen,
or, in Welsh, “Mind your ‘l’s’ and “y’s.’” But my goat under-
stands English quite well, as you’ll see *. and, moreover, is
not, as Lord RosBBERY says most other members of the Liberal
Party are, floored by words of two syllables. TAFFY is equal to five—
at least! Most Welsh words, you know, are in about twenty. At
least, they look so, to, non-Welshers— I mean, non-Welshmen.
(Aside: Hope they won't ask me what is the Welsh for “Ploughing
the Sands”.') -
Now, you, see, ladies and gentlemen, here are sixteen letters,
scattered, “in pie,'... as it were, forming a word of five syllables,
which has been familiar in our mouths as “All the Year Round”—
I mean household words—of late. (Aside: Indeed it has ' And if
they knew what a bore it has become in Cabinet Councils and other

HARD TO (L.C.) C.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I crave your advice and sympathy under the
following circumstances. I have been of late considerably perplexed
as to which side I ought to support in the forthcoming London County
Council Election. Sometimes I have felt drawn to the banner of Pro-
gressivism, at other times I have yearned to embrace Moderateness,
I do not say the Moderate Programme, because there are so many.
In my difficulty I saw an announcement that the Daily Chronicle
was about to become an illustrated paper in the interest of the Pro-
gressives. Accordingly, last Mº eagerly bought the first copy
of the newly-pictured paper, and found a delightful feast for my
eyes in a reproduction of a drawing by Sir Edward BURNE-Jon Es.
It was without doubt a charming J. of work, and the printing
was marvellously good. That decided me—I threw in my lot with
the Progressives without more ado. -
But, unfortunately, that was only the commencement of the diffi-
culty. That very afternoon I met a friend who happened to be a
“Moderate” candidate. “I suppose I can reckon on your assist-
ance, old fellow P” was his greeting as he patted me *...* On
the back. ſexplained to him that I had determined to vote fro-
gressive. He asked me why. For some time I tried to think of
some reason which should appear, on the face of it, conclusive. It
ended in my being truthful, and º: Sir Edward BURNE-Jones.
Then came the questions which have been ringing in my ears, ever

TO MY DOCTOR IN BED.
WITH much regret I hear it said
That you, dear doctor, are in bed,
Quite invalided.
For 3. the uninviting fare—
The broth, the gruel, made with care,
The milk—is needed.
I mourn, yet grimly chuckle, too,
When thinking that not I, but you,
Should be a fixture;
Not I, but you, must sadly sip,
With utterly unwilling lip,
Some awful mixture.
Not I, but you, must now obey
What dictatorial doctors say,
So interfering !
I might perhaps be less averse
To some attractive youthful nurse,
And find her cheering.
In weather such as we have had,
Your fate may not have been so bad;
In one lingers
When blizzards bite the bluish nose,
When cold half numbs the tortured toes,
The frozen fingers.
So I perhaps should envy you,
With nothing in the world to do
But, idly dozy,
And disregarding snow and storm,
To just be comfortably warm,
And snugly cosy.
To lº the time, your pulse you feel,
And dream of charms all ills to heal,
Like some magician;
In mirrors you may see your tongue;
You cannot listen to your lung,
My poor physician.
You read the Lancet, I should say,
Or books on your complaint, all day,
Stiff-bound or limptomes,
And when you Fº the volumes by,
You lie and sigh and try and di-
-agnose your symptoms.

A WALEDIGTION TO ST. WALENTINE.
"(By an Old-fashioned Fellow.)
OLD friend of the lass and the lover,
They say you are moribund now,
Your rule—it was gentle—is over.
Because—it is “vulgar” to vow,
“No class” to be vassal to Cupid,
“Bad form” to go wooing in verse! .
Well, Saint, your old rhymings were stupid
But new ones seem worse.
Your hearts and your darts were as healthy
As daffodils, larks or Spring lamb.
But now we're so wise, and so wealthy,
Simplicity strikes us as sham;
Your empire was kind, if despotic,
And blent of the smile and the tear.
But now we’re all “new” and “neurotic,”
And slaves to the queer.
A Beardsley design, now, would shock you.
And so would a verse by VERLAINE.
Our Art, modern Art, would but mock you,
Our poetry give you much pain.
Oh Woman, New Woman, thou clamorest
Loudly for right to revolt.
But oh! from our latter-day Amorist
S. W. would bolt!!!
'Tis well, good Saint Valentine, truly,
That you have got notice to quit,
For, faith ! you must find us unduly
Devoted to cynical wit.
The poor dear conventional passions,
You voiced, with bird-pipings, in Spring,
Are not “mp to date.” Love's new fashions
You never could sing !
Good gracious' LEGALLIENNE's lyrics,
And DAVIDson's Lavender-scent,
Would certainly give you hysterics.
Song now, just like wine, must ferment.
The dewdroppy old dithyrambics
You loved, in our day don't go down.
Our maidens like brisk galliambics
On which you would frown.
Indeed ithyphallics—but, bless us!
Our poesy, Saint, unto von
Would be like a new shirt of Nessus.
Our art is all yellow—or blue.
And sº poº. old boy, 'tis a blessing
You're off, with a tear in your eye.
Like soft hearts and simple caressing,
You're vulgarl Good-bye!
STRANGE OMEN.—Sir FRANK Lockwood,
Solicitor-General, was “entertained,” says
the Daily Telegraph, “to dinner”—(observe

(always a host in himself), “being a Conser-
vative,” while the other guests were either
Conservatives or Unionists. DANIEL in the
lions' den is the parallel that arises to every-
one's mind; but in this instance DANIEL
actually dined with the lions, and probably
felt none the worse for the “feast of reason

occasion when any Irish party gave their votes unless they got some-
thing for them.”
That only TIM's fun. Overcoming his emotion, he, with ruthless
force, pitiless logic, laid bare position of the new Party of the Muses.
Business done.—Parnellite Amendment, supported by Unionists,
negatived by 256 against 236.
Tuesday.-If you want to make your flesh º ou should have
heard the SPEAKER just now challenging the Lor wº of Dublin,
whom he discovered standing at Bar; and, as Sir WILFRID LAwson
adds, “not drinking.” Lºrd Mayor got up in gorgeous apparel;
scarlet gown, ermine-tipped, with gold chain gleaming across manly
chºst. Recalls days ºf yesteryear when DAwson was Lord Mayor of
Dublin. Being also Member for an Irish constituency, no autocratic
SPEAKER might challenge his right
to cross the Bar, whether in civi-
lian dress, or in robes of office.
On occasions when he had a peti-
tion to deliver he came down,
cloaked, in a four-wheeler. Made
the heart of Mr. Cove in Members'
cloak-room stand still, when he
suddenly threw back his wraps,
and disclosed glittering garb be-
neath. Sat on front bench below
gangway with, inadequate legs
partially crossed, his chain myste-
riously clanking, motion understood
at time to serve double purpose of
calling attention to Lord Mayor's
resence, and of hinting at the
ind of bond that held Ireland to
Great Britain.
Present Lord Mayor of Dublin.
not being a Member, had to rue for
admission at door of House. Word
passed to Sergeant-at-Arms; gal-
lant officer, having heard some-
thing of irish habits, observed
E." of shouldering mace
efore he went out to confront the
strangers. If they had shillelaghs,
the mace, twirled, about by lusty
arms, might be reckoned on to keep
the gate. The messengers not behind in militar
hauled out the bar—the veritable Bar of House o
which we hear so much and see so little.
“Now,” said the oldest Messenger, folding his arms and clench-
ing his teeth, “let them do their worst.”
rgeant-at-Arms marched in, mace on shoulder, escorting Lord
Mayor and two sheriffs. If they had meant mischief they thought
better of it on looking round. Lord Mayor might, it is true, if he
were in good condition have vaulted over bar or ducked beneath it,
and run amuck up floor. But then the sheriffs, before they could
have imitated him, would have been awfully mauled with the mace.
Any piratical intention that may have lurked in minds of the
insurgents was finally crushed by really awful tone in which the
SPEAKER, fixing glittering eye on group at bar, said, “My Lord
Mayor of Dublin, what have you there?”
Members expected trembling culprit would produce from under his
cloak the horse-pistol, dagger, cup of poison, or whatever he may
have brought with him with felonious intent. But he meekly
answered, “A petition.” This he unfolded, and as he showed a
disposition to read it through, Members went off.
Business done.—Another day, passed talking round Address.
NAoroji moved Amendment raising question of financial relations
between England and India. R a paper of prodigious length;
beat the tom-tom, for nearly an hour. " In churches,” said the
(almost) Reverend JEMMY Lowth ER, “an incumbent sometimes
reads himself in. NAoRoji reads his congregation out. Mayn't be
quite so black as the MARKiss painted him, but he's quite as long-
winded as could have been expected.”

Thursday.—New Session not quite a fortnight old, and lo! a
strange thing has happened. Electric bells struck—I mean they won't
strike. When, just now, House cleared for division on Amnesty
motion electric knobs touched as usual. Thereupon hould have
followed tintinnabulation of the bells in all the rooms and corridors
outside the Chamber. Only little tinkle heard; sort of weird mock-
ing laugh, “Ha! hal” and then silence.
Consequences might have been serious. Last thing well-trained
Member regards as absolute preliminary to voting is to sit throughout
the debate. Scattered far and wide, in library, tea-room, dining-
room, or smoking-room, when they hear the bell they rush in to
Libby's Share.
temporarily overcome by sending policemen and messengers bawlin
along all the passages, “Division division!”. This all very w
for the moment; but what is to be done about the bells?
ALBERT Rollit, steeped in parliamentary usages, says, “If the
}. won't obey the SPEAKER's order, send them to the Clock
ower.
STUART promptly places at disposal of SPEAKER a squadron of Star
boys, to run about premises on given signal and proclaim division.
“They’d do it º better than the policemen and messengers,” he
Say8.
True; but as Colonel Legge º they would be certain in
excitement of moment, instead of calling out “Division,” to lapse
into more familiar cry, “Hextra Speshull’. That would never do.
Simplest plan is to stop this interminable talk round the Address and
get to work. When the electric bells shut up in sheer disgust at
waste of time, grown-up men of
business may be expected to recon-
sider the position.
Business done.—TIM HARRING-
Ton talked for two hours and five
minute about ancient history of
Maamtrasna.
Friday.—Much murmuring be-
low Gangway just now because to
programme of Session already
overloaded Government decline to
add Bill providing for payment of
Members. SAGE of QUEEN ANNE's
GATE been observed to regard this
topic with smiling equanimity.
Secret of his content now dis-
closed. Papers report how Spanish
merchant, resident in Barcelona,
having studied SAGE's public Par-
liamentary career, begs leave, as
trifling indication of his esteem and
admiration, to be permitted to pay
SAGE's election expenses whenever
incurred.
“”Tis a pretty variation on
Spanish devotional habit,” says
PlUNKET, who has followed Bok-
Row's footsteps in Spain. “More
especially in rural districts, pious
men approach the shrine of favourite saint and hang upon it an
offering, peradventure poor in intrinsic value, but rich in proportion
to their revenues. Expect by-and-by the SAGE will be canonised,
and straying by the banks of the Guadalquivir, you shall here and
there come upon shrines to Saint LABBy, rich with votive offerings.”
“That may be so,” said GoRST. “You’re always ready to take
the poetic view of a thing. But I’d like to wait and see the colour
of the money. You know the SAGE has l"; been firing away at
enterprising traders in Spain who, usually dating their missives
from a State prison, offer for a slight consideratiºn, to disclose
fabulous stores of hidden wealth. The SAGE has spoiled their little
game. Should like to be quite sure they've not broken out in a new
place, and are trying it on first with the SAGE.”

No. W.-GoLF.
“THE OLD SCOTCH TERRIERs.”
TALL TALES OF SPORT AND ADVENTURE.
(By Mr. Punch's own Short Story-teller.)
I.—THE PINK HIPPOPOTAMUS. (continued FRom PAGE 81.)
IN these awful circumstances, with the night air whistling past me,
and with my beloved CHUDDAH and her nurse hurtling upwards
beside me, it is scarcely necessary for me to say that I never for an
instant lost my coolness and my perfect self-possession. That the
situation was dangerous, nay, almost desperate, I fully realised, but
it is in these very situations that true courage and resourcefulness
are always of the highest value. Again and again in the course of
my long life have I plucked safety, aye, and that which is higher and
better than all safety, namely, reputation, from the nettle danger.
Let fools prate as they will; the brave man must always rise
triumphant above the stormy waves of envy and detraction.
These thoughts, I admit, did not occur to me at the moment. Our
flight was too perilous and too swift to allow me to think of aught
saye what concerned the immediate necessities of this truly fearful
crisis. Poor little CHUDDAH, I observed, being made of lighter
material, was gradually outstripping me in this dreadful and in-
voluntary race. First her head topped me; then her shoulders soared
beyond me; at last her feet were on a level with my face. As one of
them (I forget which) passed upwards, I was just able by leaning
slightly forward, to imprint a kiss upon it. “Farewell, CăUDDAH,”
I sighed, as the lovely foot, left my lips. “Farewell, ORLANDo,”
she murmured all but inaudibly, and fled up, up, up into the dismal
night. I never saw her again.
The Ayah, however, a stout and heavy woman, was still beside
me, rising inch for inch as I rose. By turning slightly round I could
look at her. I did so. Judge of my horror when I realised by the
faint light of the stars that the Ayah was no longer alive The
shock of the sudden ascent must have proved too much for one
accustomed to the sedate and comfortable life of an eastern palace,
and enfeebled, moreover, by advancing age. The explosion acting on
such a constitution had snapped the cords that kept life in her faithful
body. The Ayah was dead, and I who tell this tale was alone with a
corpse in the encircling atmosphere ! . As I realised this horrible
situation, I confess that for the first and last time in my life I turned
faint with a feeling almost amounting to fear. In imagination I
saw myself speeding for ever, as the aeons revolved in their courses,
with only a dead Indian nurse to keep me company. Then,
by an instantaneous revulsion, the grim humour of the situation
struck me. With only my knapsack of provisions and my brandy-
flask, it was unlikely, even under the most favourable circum-
stances, that I should be able to prolong life for more than a
week. At the end of a week, then, I too should be a corpse. I
laughed aloud as I thought of the last scion of the WILBRAHAMs,
the unconquerable ORLANDo, mated in mid-air to the dusky Ayah,
a skeleton to a skeleton, and my sepulchral “Ha, ha,” went rever-
berating through the dim spaces of night. The sound roused me
once more. y, after all, should I die?, Life was sweet; much
remained to be done; there were wrongs still to be redressed in the
world below; millions of the oppressed still waited for a deliverer;
countless herds of big game º roamed the prairies or made their
lairs in the forests of earth. No, I would live if I could, and prove
once more the unquenchable fortitude of my race.
At this moment I looked down.

MEN OF THE HOUR.
THE TURNCOCK.
This eminent individual, born in the early forties, comes of a numerous
family, and was originally destined by his parents for the career of a night-
watchman. Not feeling, however, any vocation in this direction, he tried
many other gº. and, many other professions tried him. At last,
in the year 1864, he entered the service of the Twiddlesex Water Company,
where, by strict attention to the quality of his liquor, and his unfailing
perception of the right, time to be sober, he has risen to his present
conspicuous and responsible position.
OF THE ART OF TOBOGGANING.
- - - - Canton des Grisons, Feb. 10.
For the neighbourhood it is a sultry day; glass up to 5°Fahrenheit
and a taint of scirocco, or fühn, as the facetious native calls this
wind. My toboggan lies idle by stress of drifting snow. “No
chance,” I say, “of doing a record this afternoon l’” This is what I
say openly and pompously to my fellows. With my own dear heart
I commune otherwise, saying how heaven should be praised for this
one blessed day's recess from broken scalp.
If I have asked myself once (as is proper with an enigma) I have
asked myself a thousand times.“Why did I come out here, to this
resort of invalids and polar athletes?” ... My right lung is flawless:
my left is very perfect. On the other hand I do not show well on
ice; my legs are ill-shaped for bandy; curling I find to be but poor
ºport after skittles; and I have met one wayfarer only, and that a
fool, who did not laugh upon my figure-skating.
. In a climate, where one must either, do or suffer something to
ustify one's existence, there remained this sole thing—to toboggan.
said, “I will surely toboggan 1"
“Gocd!” they said; “but on an instrument of what sort P. “Swiss’
for women and children; ordinary “Americas” for men; ‘Skeleton
Americas' for heroes.”
'. I will choose the last,” I said; for if I do anything at all I like p
to do it passing well, and with the best of tools.
There was no lack of willing teachers to illustrate for me the true
posture-rentre d terre, and to show me how I should go armed as to
. Alpine boots with spiked rakes screwed to the forefront of my
sole for the better negotiation of sharp angles on the side of a ravine.
. One inay add that if a pine-tree, or a telegraph post, or an ascend-
ing hay-sleigh opposes your career, you learn by the simple inter-
position of your head to save the delicate machinery ºf the toboggan
from brutalization. It mayl be that by inadvertence you have at-
tained an impetus so terrific that you overtake a walking horse in
possession of the path, Once again your headpiece will protect the
instrument from the fiery choler of the beast's hind hoof. After
some two miles of fortuitous descent, diversified by such checks?as
I have here shadowed forth, you will be rounding the final corner
at a pointed angle of 45°, travelling perhaps several miles per hour,
when a large beer-cart with an upward tendency will dispute the road.
Then the banked snow shall be your pall, and your requiescat shall
be rendered by the local teamster in German of a bastard order.
Nor is this all. To the beetling edge of the descent you will first
have been conveyed by animpetuous zwei-spänner, thoughtlessly gay
with bells and feathers. wenty-five candidates having urged
their claims for the five seats, some will have need to be content
to trail behind on their toboggans. As one wanting in experience,
you will have the last place assigned to you, or else the last but one,
with a casual riderless machine at the tail-end to give you an unholy
spasm as it swings off the track round the corners. At intervals,
while your pensive mind is absorbed upon the maintenance of a happy
equilibrium, rendered strangely-difficult by the ruthless s of
the sleigh, some two or perhaps three of the tailing-party will fall
off in front. The sharp contact of several raked boots with your
#. countenance draws your attention to the altered condition of
things. Over the mangled bodies of friend and foe you are carried
forward. The sleigh is tardily arrested, and your innocent head
becomes the recipient of fearless abuse.
Or again, from some mountain-hut upon the route issues forth a
gross and even elephantine dog, born of unhallowed union between a
wolf-hound and an evilly-bred St. Bernard. Foiled in his attack
upon the head of the caravan he revenges himself upon the out-
stretched leg of the hindmost. . The lacerated calf will be your own.
This is well enough in open daylight, and when you are swathed in
buskins from heel to hip, and your rakes are good for retaliation.
But in doubtful moonlight with the air at 15° below zero, as you
toboggan back to your hostelry in the valley from a fancy dress ball,
where you have simulated Hamlet in black silk tights and pumps,
the humour lies purely on the side of the dog.
But apart from the lower animal nature, in this barbaric sport you
are never confident of your dearest friends. Thus, we had been a
pleasant and hilarious party at the international bal masqué; the
ardour of the stirrup-cup was still upon us as we attained the brow
of the decline. By a happy inspiration I had proposed that my
friend Mr. STARK MUNRo, ºil. a heavy-weight and disguised as a
Völsunga Saga, should proceed in the van to clear any incidental
drift or desultory avalanche. He º headlong down the
pine-forest track followed by the Ace of Clubs, a Sardinian Brigand,
and a Tonsured Benedictine. All the costumes gained in picturesque-
ness from the Arctic background.
The New Woman of the party, attired as Good Queen Bess, begged
me to precede her, arguing that I should go faster on my Skeleton
than she on her Swiss. Iengaged to do so on the understanding that
she should allow me seven minutes' start in case of eventualities,
the course being usually done in some 53 minutes under happy.con-
ditions. She was to be succeeded by Antigone, the Spirit of the
Engadine and the Mother of the Gracchi. -
I do not greatly care to linger over the details of my descent, I
had started gaily humming those Elizabethan lines, “Fain would I
climb, but that I fear to fall,”—out of pure gallantry to Good Queen
Bess who had given me a dainty little cow-bell as a favour at the
cotillon; and I had been travelling cautiously for 84 minutes, with
my nose, no fewer than six fingers, and all the toes on each foot
frostbitten, and a half-moon piece already gone out of my calf at the
spot where it had attracted the notice of the St. Bernard wolf-hound,
when, even as I was navigating a rotten bridge at a sharp turn...I
heard a rushing sound out of the night behind me, and “Achtung!”
(the terrible warning-note of the tobogganer) rang in my stricken ear.
I had barely time to throw a backw glance of horror and
deprecation, when the projecting feet of Good Queen Bess, her
toboggan and her spiked steering-pegs were upon me.
The bridge had never been strong in point of bulwarks; the
torrent which it spans is rapid and § from icy heights; its banks
do not lend themselves to debarkation.
When I recovered consciousness by force of exquisitely painful
restoratives applied by the Völsunga Saga, the Mother of the
Gracchi and Good Queen Bess (herself unscratched, though the
lush of her toboggan was tarnished with my gore), I was solemnly
intoning, “World without end: Achtung.'” with all the conviction
of a cathedral tenor. I am going home the day after to-morrow.
Suggestion.—A certain restaurant not a hundred miles away from
the St. James's Theatre advertises, among other attractions, “Diner
Salon Gobelin, 7s. 6d.” But wouldn't it be more appropriate to
spell the last word “Gobbling”?

what might have been expected
from Mr. BARLow, but no doubt
Masters SANDFord and Mehton
in the Strangers' Gallery were
mightily, delighted at the pros-
pect of “coarser yarns”—(which
is only another name for men's
stories, after dinner when the
ladies have left the room)-being
“exempted from duties.” Really
our old friend, the preceptor of

: SCRAP II.-THE HAPPY Home.
The first night we went to see
GEORGE Don Keystir we heard in
the kitchen a curious voice—sug-
gestive somehow of vine-leaves in
the hair-singing “Ours is a
Happy, Happy Home 1” In the hall we saw none but a wee boy
of four, standing on his head, balancing a billiard-cue on his chin.
Published at the Bodily Head. . A
body and precious little head.
“All done by kindness!” lisped the little chap
As we made an attempt to enter the dining-room
what should fall on our heads but a great we
sponge, backed by a ring of laughter from th
hidden, prompter, and GroRGE appeared, shouting
“Bo!” followed by the loving wife, who helper
to make the fun possible. What a time we had
From the moment we arrived (and fell over
'string adroitly arranged by the dear little children
across the little hall) to the moment that we haſ
got into our -
little apple-pie
beds, p º:
fun, frolic,
merrimelit, and; domestic joy.
Just as we were falling asleep,
tired out with a happy evening,
we were disturbed by a chorus,
as of waits, singing outside our
room these beautiful words—
“01 Flo, what a change you know !
When he left the village he was shy,
But since he come into a little bit
of splosh
His golden hair is hanging down
his back!”
This was more of GEoRGE's loving ingenuity. But we wished h
had made it rhyme. His wife had helped him, but she would no
take the credit: , “That was GroBGE's idea,” laughed along her lips
I, threatened, “to make copy” of him, and now I have done it
Moreover, I shall further presume on his forbearance by writing nº
more about him for the present.

ALL THE DIFFERENce.--In the programme of the Ballad Concert
given in the Times, Mr. BEN DAVIEs was advertised to sing SULLI.
van's “Come, Come, Margherita.” Now the title of this song is it
refrain, i.e., “Come, MARGHERITA, come!”.which is evidently
loyer's passionate invitation, while if it is written as “Come, Come
Margherita,” it is clearly only an expostulation of a rather common-
place character uttered to MARGHERITA, who has been exasperatingly
petulant, and, who, won't come when asked. For many many year.
it was the fashion (as it still is with the veteran tenor) for “MAUD”
to be invited to “come into the *::::" just as the fly used to b

probable meaning of the L. C. C. Election
Aells:--
HEAR the loud Election bells—
Noisy bells!
What a world of wonderment their clatter-
clash compels l
How they jangle, jangle, º,
On the air of coming night
Like committee-men a-wrangle,
And my thoughts are in a tangle
Of mixed doldrums and delight.
How they chime, chime, chime !
And I wish I were but certain what their
shindying foretells,
What a future I may gather from the voices
of the bells—
The jangling and the wrangling of the
bells |
Now they sound like wedding bells,
Golden bells!
Meaning mischief in their music to the
Moderates and the swells!
Their vibrations there's a vox in
Which to me sounds like a tocsin.
From their molten golden notes,
in tune,
What a pleasant sound there floats
Like a promise of Progressive Party Wotes,
Blessed boon!
Oh, from Bow to Sadler's Wells,
How it swells!
How it dwells
On the Future! how it tells
Of the Progress that impels .
To the swinging and the ringing
Of the bells, bells, bells.
From the Brixtons, Claphams, Southwarks,
Islingtons and Clerkenwells,
To the hyming and the chiming of those
- bells -
Hear the Rate-Alarum bells—
Brazen bells!--
What bºdial- their loud turbulency
tells!
In men's startled ears in spite,.
How . scream out their affright.
Too much horrified to speak
They can only shriek, shriek,
Through the fog,
In a clamorous appealing to the voters to
retire
That much Progressive Party, which—much
like the Rates, or fire-
Climbeth higher, higher, higher,
With a desperate desire,
And a bullying endeavour
Now—now to sit, or never
In the seat of Gog-Magogl
Oh, those bells, bells, bells
What a tale their terror tells
f despair!
What reactionary roar!
What a horror they outpour . .
On the bosom of the City and Mayfair.
Yet the ear it fully knows
By their twanging
And their clanging
How the voting ebbs and flows.
Yet the ear distinctly tells -
In the jangling and the wrangling
How Monopoly sinks or swells
By the sinking or the swelling in the clangour
of those bells--
Beastly bells!— -
Their is Landlordism, Ground-rents, Dirty
Slums, and Drinking Hells
In *: * of those horrid Moderate
eils .
Hear the rolling of the bells,<
Polling bells! -
What a world of solemn thought their monody
compels. -
So Dick WHITTINGTON.—poor wight!—
Heard them ringing, with delight
At the fair prophetic promise of their tone!
For every sound that floats
May I too hope my votes
Will have grown P.
And the People—ah, the People!—
Is their verdict, from each steeple,
All mine own P -
Does that tolling, tolling, tolling,
Mean “Return again my Dick!”
Or do they as they're rolling -
Mean “turn out” or “cut your stick!”?
Shall I be “Lord Mayor of London”?
Or are we Progressives undone
At the Polls P
Pussy, what is it that tolls
From each º: as it rolls,
Rolls?
A papan from the bells
To the Party of the Swells?
Qr a message from the bells
That Reaction howls and yells?
Does that tintinnabulation
Mean false Joks “Tenification”
Or our own “Unification”? -
Sounds dear “Betterment” this time
In the rolling Runic rhyme
Of the bells P
Does their throbbing mean that jobbing,
And the London Landlord's robbing,
Find their finish in these bells?

In my head there runs a rhyme,
That Monopoly is sobbing
What a gush of Unity voluminously swells.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
MRs. BonneR has done well to write a
record of the life and work of her father,
CHARLEs BRADLAUGH, which FISHER UN win
publishes in two volumes. lf it had been
one 'twould have been better. Mrs. Bonn ER
has been assisted in her labours by Mr. J. M.
Robertson, who deals with Mr. BRADLAUGH’s
political doctrine and work, and describes in
detail his parliamentary struggle. The con-
sequence is that the record runs into two
closely-printed volumes, a proportion that
somewhat overweights the interest of the
subject. Mrs. Bonn ER is, naturally, indig-
nant at the treatment her father received in
the early days of his parliamentary life and
in other public relations. But Mr. BRAD-
LAUGH was a fighting man. He gave hard
knocks and, to do him justice, did not unduly
complain, when knocks were dealt back to
him. It is a pathetic story how the crowning
triumph of his life came in the hour of his
death. He never knew that the House of
Commons had unanimously agreed to the
motion which expunged from its journals
the resolution excluding the junior member
for Northampton from its membership. That
confession, my Baronite says, was the com-
E. justification of the action on Mr.
RADLAUGH’s part that enlivened the Par-
liament of 1880-5 and was the immediate
cause of the birth of the Fourth Party.
Mr. John DAVIDson's Earl Lavender is
“pernicious nonsense,” and the Aubrey-Beards-
ley frontispiece—if, considering its subject, it
can, with absolute correctness, be described
as a “frontispiece,”—might, a few years ago,
have endangered its existence. But “I su
pose,” quoth the Baron, “I am becoming old-
fashioned, and ‘we have changed all that
now.' But in view of this extraordinary illus-
tration, is it a book that can be left out "pro-
miscuously-like” on the drawing-room table?
I trow not,” quoth the Baron. “And as to
The Great God Pan, (Key-note', series),
well—infernally or diabolically clever it
may be, but, were I informed,” quoth the
Baron, “that we should never look upon its
like again, I, for one, could not grieve.”
Another Keynoteworthy book, i.e., one quite
worthy to belong to such of the Key-note series
as the Baron has read, is The Dancing Faun.
Had a novel appeared some years ago in the
palmy, but not less leggy, days of the drama
at the Gaiety, entitled The Dancing Vaughan,
when the elegant KATE of that ilk was the
light and leading danseuse, what a vogue
such a volume would have had among the
}. of the above-mentioned Temple of
urlesque - Extravaganza. “Oil sont les
neiges d'antan f" and “Where is dat barty
now r?” B. DE B.-W.
A Double APPLICABILITY.-“Intrigues
which render stable government impossible,”
though a phrase applied by the Times to
Egyptian affairs, would, it is clear, be ap-
plicable to attempts to get at the jockey, or
Professional Model. “It's comin' to HomeFING,

A SONNET OF SONNETS.
(A Dreadful Object-Lesson.)
I’ve often thought I'd like to write a sonnet,
I wonder, though, if I can find the way.
Sometimes you muse upon your mistress—
say
Her eyebrow, then you poetise upon it.
Maybe instead you celebrate her bonnet,
A striking symphºny in green or grey.
And when it's done, for many and many a
ay,
With eager eye, you ever scan and con it,
Intent on seeing that it’s quite correct,
And free from all suspicion of defect,
No inauspicious phrase, no halting line,
And when the time of scrutiny is past
Your thought is probably exactly mine—

SIGNS OF THE TIMES.
At the re-opening of the Royal United Service Institution last
week by H.R.H. the Prince of WALEs, in new premises at Whitehall,
a nºvel and ingenious electrical instrument was exhibited. By means
of this addition to the list of communicators a general in the field is
able not only to send an autograph letter to a colleague or subordi-
nate at a distance, but also to convey in facsimile a drawing of his
own composition. On the occasion to which reference is made, the
Prince of WALEs sent a message to his brother. To this despatch the
Duke of CoNNArght was obliged to respond that he did not quite un-
derstand its full meaning. According to the reports some slight
error was rectified, and then the machine worked to everyone's satis-
faction...However, the fact remains that the initial attempt to convey
intelligibly a message was not entirely successful. To impress upon
those answerable for the perfect action of the instrument the im-
portance of their task, we subjoin an imaginary scene of a nearly
impossible situation. We will a ume that a commander-in-chief.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FRoM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, February 18.
—Debate on Address finished at last. Been
on the whole dreary business. Instead of
sharp roar of honest artillery from Opposition
camp at opening of campaign, series of squibs
popped off; some of them damp. Novel idea
at commencement of new Session for Opposi-
tion chiefs to lurk in the wood armed with
blunderbusses, watching efforts of lesser vil-
lains to waylay and murder Ministers, they
coming on scene when these efforts been
repulsed. Novel, but on whole not so suc-
cessful that we are likely to see repetition,
Odd thing is that in series of divisions
Government had nearest squeak on motion
for the Closure. S. Woods had amendment
on paper; wanted to have debate adjourned
so that another day might be appropriated
for his use ; SQUIRE of MALwood thought
really been enough talk round Address.
Moved closure. Woods and two or three
other good Radicals go into Lobby against
Ministers; others abstain; 94; seeing
opportunity flock into Lobby; inistry saved
by eight votes.
“Yes,” said the SQUIRE of MALwood as we
walked home together, after last division, “it
is not exactly encouraging. But what dis-
tresses me most is the way some of our fellows
talk about RoseBERY. Used to be old con-
stitutional maxim that the King can, do no
wrong. Modern reading on our side is that
PREMIER can do no right. Speeches like
DiLKE's to-night hurt memore than anything
else.” This conversation followed close on
one I had earlier in day with the noble lord.
“How's the Squire looking?” he asked,
anxiously. “Bearing up I trust, against the
fatigues of a thankless task. What a few of
our men say about me not the slightest con-
sequence. Passes over me like fluttering of
idle wind. Know all about it. Could, an' I
would, describe animating motive in each
case. What cuts me to the heart is their
treatment of the SQUIRE. He manages admir-
ably. Spares no labour; makes no mistake.
Yet whenever some men returned to support
us are not permitted to take in own hands
direction of public business, they go over to
the enemy. Great blessing the SQUIRE is
endowed by nature with angelic temper.
Otherwise, when this sort of thing happens
he would chuck up the whole business, an
tell malcontents and deserters to manage
matters for themselves.”
So nice to have this state of things existing.
Sufferers in common affliction, each thinks
only of the other. Business done.—Address
agreed to after ten days talk.
Tuesday Night.—Every prospect of quiet
evening, even talk of count out. After spend-
ing our nights and days with Address during
last fortnight, small wonder if the hearts of
Members, untravelled, fondly turn to home.

On mutually suitable spots,
And I swore I would do what I could, love,
To try to unite the two lots.

And great was my rapture to find

SPEAKER circumstances attendant upon mysterious disappearance of
Joey C. last night. When House cleared for division on JAMEs's
motion, Joe seen to leave and go into Lobby. Thereafter all trace lost

he was seen, endeavouring to induce SFRJEANT-AT-ARMs to unlock

Joseph when the division was taken?’” House faced by mystery

place. Accordingly got itself counted out at eight o'clock. Business
done.—Second reading of London Waterworks Bill carried.

TALL TALES OF SPORT AND ADVENTURE.
I.—THE PINK HIPPOPOTAMUS.
(continued.)
Professor of Phlebotomy in the University of Bermuda, I was now
proceeding in a series of gigantic serpentine curves through the air.
At the moment of which I am speaking I was at the top of one of
these curves, and I calculated that, with luck, I should just be able,

to move in a kind of switchback
fashion towards the earth, and

Slowly and with determination
I drew up my right leg, and
letting it out backwards with
the force of a Nasmyth hammer,
delivered my foot full against
the body of the Ayah. Every-
thing happened as I had anti-
cipated. There was a dull and
melancholy thud as the lifeless

body went off at its involuntary tangent, while I flew sidelong and
in a downward direction, my whole course being changed by the
impetus of the kick.
How long I flew like this I know not. At such a crisis moments
are centuries. After a time I re-opened my eyes and looked about
me. Where was I? Could it be? Yes-no–and yes again. All
that I saw was familiar. The towers, the cupolas, the domes, the
minarets, the battlements—all these I had seen before. Scarcely two
hundred yards below me lay the Diamond City from which I had that
very night ascended.

well-known laws of gravitation, partly owing to the celebrated air-

At hº echoed her own voice;
For iver shouting as they shoine,
Our hiven's a Donnybrook divoine!
I think I shall never forget, love,
How I called with an order to view;
You were empty, and still “Tobe Let,” love,
And I was untenanted too.
I stocked you; I saw that we stood, love,
On mutually suitable spots,
And I swore I would do what I could, love,
To try to unite the two lots.
I cautiously mooted the question
And great was my rapture to find
That my timidly-ventured suggestion
Was not quite averse to your mind.
I therefore grew bold and took heart, love,
The business was promptly despatched,
We no longer stood coldly apart, love,
For lo, we were closely attached.
'Tis long since this happened, and now, love,
Folk see us so happily matched,
They are ready to promise and vow, love,

Two beings were never so blended,
They say we could never be twain-
Well, so let it be, till life's ended,
And one let us ever remain!
IRISH ASTRONOMY.
SIR Robert BALL, recently delivering a
lecture (by request) under the above title,
admitted that he did not quite know what it
meant, as he did not suppose Irish astronomy
was differentfrom that #. nations. Isn't
it bejabers?. J ºf §º. of reasoning,
we can imagine that Iri *} may
as sui generis as are Irish politics. It is pro-
bably unusually nebulous, and characterised
by the revolution of suns round their satel-
lites, and the prevalence of excentric comets
and shooting stars. Had ADDIson had it in
mind, he would probably have written his
celebrated hymn somewhat as follows:–
The º: firmament on hoigh,
And all the green Hibernian skoy,
And ...; hivens a foighting frame,
The reign of chaos do proclaim.
What ºthough the “stars” do shoine—and
squall,
And on"each other's orbits fall!
What though no order, stable, sound,
Amidst those jarring sphayres be found!
THE ARCHITECT TO HIS WIFE.
I PoETISE seldom or never,
As a rule I am not such an ass;
Ihandle a metre scarce ever,
Unless it's connected with gas.
But once I was tempted to stray, dear,
In the realms of the Muses above,
And in somewhat professional way, dear,
To sing the delights of my love.
I thought of you, sweet my DRUSILLA,
As the daintiest lot in the land,
The prettiest fairy-like villa
That ever an architect planned.
You offered attractions unnumbered,
Your t was sunny, and bright,
And my fancies ran wild, when Islum-
bered,
Depicting the charms of your site. |

THE INTERVIEWER'S WADE MEGUM.
Question. What is the object of an inter-
viewer P
Answer. To show the merit of his work at
the expense of the interviewed.
º, s there any choice in selecting a sub-
ject
A. Very little, all that is necessary is that
the name at the head of the article shall be
fairly familiar to the general reader.
Q. Need the interviewer record the history
of the interviewed ?
A. No; unless matter grows short and the
exploits of the hero are required for padding.
Q. But have not those exploits made the
hero famous?
4; Yes, and consequently they have become
“old matter.” To be interesting, details, if
frivolous, must be up to date.
Q. Which would be the better copy—an
account of the subject's most successful cam-
paign, or a description of his wardrobef
A. Undoubtedly the latter. The exploits
will certainly have been described a score of
times, but a list of coats, hats and neckties
will probably have the charm of novelty.
|. A. Notif it merely recorded his public life.
|In such a case it would be distinctly less
| interesting than his butcher's book.
Q. Are the surroundings of a hero of
moment P
A. Certainly, if they are little known.
The back yard of the greatest t becomes
a spot of interest if it has hitherto
escaped description.
. Then a poet's staircase is more memor-
able than his stanzas”
A. Certainly; and the warrior's umbrella-
stand than the record of his battles—a
philosopher's overcoat than the tale of his
scientific discoveries.
Q. If the interviewed has a dog or a cat,
is it advisable to refer to the fact?
A. Assuredly, and such a reference should
run to the length of half a dozen pages, and
possibly a couple of illustrations,
Q. But surely the interviewed must sacri-
fice a fair amount of time to the interviewer?
A. Quite so; but the obligation is mutual.
Q. And yet it is only the interviewer gets
a reward?
A. In money. But then the interviewed
has his advertisement.
A. If the account is published at the com-
mencement of the season it may convert the
*: into a Society lion. -
. And what are the advantages enjoyed
by such a creature?
4. Invitations to dinners, dances, and at
homes, from all-but-perfect strangers—for a
while.
Q. And what follow?
4. Reaction and forgetfulness. -
Q. It seems that to be interviewed is not
permanently beneficial to the subject?
A. Of course not; but that is a matter of
small importance to the interviewer.
Q. Then what advantage does the latter
obtain at the cost of the former ?
A. That is a question that can best be
answered by reference to the ledgers of the
publishers.
Q. Why should not the interviewed turn
the tables upon their visitors and become the
interviewers?
A. Because an interviewer is seldom of suf-
ficient i. to undergo the operation.
Q. Is there any other reason P
A. Certainly ; and a most important one.
If the interviewer became the interviewed,
from the latter's point of view it wouldn't
pay.

ADWERTISEMENT EXTRAORDINARY.
To the Editor of “Punch.”
SIR,-We think it our duty to callyour attention to the appearance
of a book that otherwise would have }". entirely escaped your
attention. It is called. A Neglected Incident in a Cºmpany's
Career. It is written by a gentleman, with a name of historical
importance, and contains, amongst other inviting
matter, several letters #om the author to his
illustrious ancestor. It is full of the most in-
teresting stories, although its accuracy is scarcely
unimpeachable. As some of the tales are not
entirely laudatory of the Company with which we
had the honour once to be connected, we beg to
lay our case before you.
We have approached the writer of the book,
and asked him to withdraw it. We have not
ſº obtained a satisfactory answer. We have also
% appealed to the publisher of the book (whose name
we would give in full if we did not think that
you might editorially suppress it, as there is a
column set apart in another portion of your issue for book adver-
tisements), and he, too, has not seen his way to rendering us any
assistance. He has referred us to the author, who still leaves us
without a remedy.
However, the publisher (with whom we cannot absolutely agree)
makes a suggestion which seems to us in every way admirable. As
it is our wish to cause A Neglected Incident in a Company's Career
to be as little circulated as possible, he proposes that we should write
a joint letter to all the leading London papers, setting forth the
highly interesting character of its contents. This we are now doing,
as you will see from this communication.
Yours truly, (Signed) BENJAMIN BRowN.
JoBN JONES.
RALPH ROBINSON.
P.S.–It is unnecessary to state, after the above, ingeniqus
explanation and gratuitous advertisement, that it is highly probable

With pleadings of humanity.

'Tis time, ’tis time! Incarnate crime,
Embodied cruelty and lust, -
Trampler in slaughter-sanguined slime,
Mocker of loyalty and trust;
Derider of the human bond,
Befouler of barbaric faith,
Are there fanatics now so fond
As to protest against thy scath?

Sickened at that dread Death-Pit's sight,
And with just i. burn,

A blade-like beam of menace clear,
Typing the brand of Nemesis.

To palliate such a scene as this.
The treacherous pact, the stabber's snare,
The butcher-orgie, that grim grave,
From which fire would not purge the air,
That was not hidden by the wave;
The stealthy trick, the crawling lie-
These stain the record. Can the Turk,
For all his age-learnt subtlety,
Blot out the count of such black work.
Justice will heed the faintest plea
Even from blood-stained lips, if truth
Linger upon them; but must flee
maundering and maudlin ruth,
If this red record 'stablished stand.
The stealthy prowler loves the night,
Disturbed.' Those shining furtive eyes
Glance angrily askance-in fear! .
The women's shrieks, the children's cries,
Which we in fancy still can hear,

The same stern voice which CAIN reproved,
Frightens the ghoul in his dark lair!

“LITERATURE AND ART.”
[The Table of Contents of the Yellow Book has
two sub-titles, “Literature” and “Art.”]
No possibility of doubt
Can stop us now in finding out
What “literature” should be;
No longer dazed by rival claims,
We read a row of deathless names,
Not yet renowned, but would-be.
Not “letterpress,” or other word
As modest, that would be absurd,
Contemptuous and slighting ;
But “literature,” which for long,
It may be right, it may be wrong,
Has meant the best of writing.
Those duller minds which once essayed
To ply the literary trade,
Poor SHAKSPEARE, DANTE, Hom ER,
Did not describe their feebler work
As “literature.” . GIBBon, BURKE
Avoided this misnomer.
The art of writing now we learn.
Should PoE or WycHERLY return
They would not be neglected.
The corpses, tombs and worms of one,
The other's plain, outspoken fun,
Would never be rejected.
But anyone may marvel why
Sane persons read, and even buy,
A page, a word, a letter
Of this new school, yet hardly know
The works of WycIIERLY or PoE,
Still literature is but a part;
These pages also teach us “art,”
S ing TINTORETTo.
Allegro, not in MILTON's way,
But, with the modern meaning, “gay”;
Not too gay, allegretto.
VELAsquez, you were but an ass,
Like REMBRANDT, TITIAN, alas !
All despicable duffers.
And Romney, REYNoLDs (poor old fool!)
And GAINSBoRough, a simple school
At last we know what art should be.
A subject which we cannot see,
In spite of all our trying;
The portraits not like anyone,
The findsºape, though not “well begun,”
“Half done” there’s no denying.
And BEARDSLEY shows us now the nude;
It would not shock the primmest prude,
Or rouse the legislature.
An unclothed woman, ten feet high,
Could not make anyone feel shy;
She’s “art,” she is not nature.
TENIFICATION.
(By the Birmingham Oracle.)
THE “units” or “areas” of London,
However you turn 'em or twist'em,
Must be ranged—or the Capital's undone—
On the (Birmingham).Decimal System,
For London's just ten times as big
As the Midland's Miraculous Model.
For the L. C. G. care not a fig,
Their “Unification” is twaddle:
Lord! what can such novices know
Of the right size for Municipalities?
Sir John should take council with Joe,
Who is old, and has dealt with realities.
Great PLATO might prate about “ ,”
Which were stored in some limbo ideal.
His eye modern Brummagem wipes,
'Tis the standard for all, and ’tis real.
No, London's “divides” must be Ten I
'Tis no matter what you’ll be terming 'em,
But surely ’tis clear to all men
That they mustn't be bigger than Birming-


So infinitely better.
A-sham!
Of blundering old buffers.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House, of Commons, , Monday Night, February 25, – Glasgae
setting. its house, in order. Local authorities have drafted, Bill
regulating domestic institutions. One of a class that come regularly
to Westminster....House knows nothing of particulars, but is final
arbiter. This Bill, like many others of same kind, would have
passed without notice, if lynx eye of JEMMY LowTHER had not
chanced to fall * it. Horrified to discover its many infringe-
ments of personal liberty. Glasgae bailies well known for what
Asquith would call their “almost convulsive” purity. Only the
other day they sternly repressed artistic enterprise whose develop-
ment was unaccompanied by what they regard, as adequacy of
clothing. In this Bill they leave nothing untouched.
º whustling on the Sabbath is a crime long ago stamped out
on the banks of the Clyde.
- But there are other habits *g. to
headlong youth which Glasgae is determined to § down. ys have
been known, for example, unlawfully to run behind a tramcar, fol-
...; up the vehicle with felonious intent of obtaining a free ride,
probably in the opposite way they were going when they met the
conveyance, and were attracted by the opportunity furnished by the
conductor collecting fares on the roof. ey would be well advised,
after the Glasgae Corporation Police Bill is passed, to forego that
delirious delight. As CRoss, apologetically presenting himself as
Glasgae citizen and Glasgae Member, put it, if the Bill passed, no
cat could catch a mouse, no dog might :*:::::: in Glasgae, with-
out being subject to a penalty of forty shillings. A. similar fine
awaits a man upon conviction of having exposed to public view a leg
of mutton, unless it be decently draped.
Effect of Bill upon CALDw ELL a little, painful to Members sitting
near him. Lashed himself into a g fury. Desiring, with
national economicºnstinct, to make one effort simultaneously serve
sibly addressed to SPEAKER in Chair, it might be heard in Glasgae.
Something weird-looking about CALDwell when he thus from his
seat in House of Commons whispers in ear of constituents in far-off
Lanark. The startled stranger crossing Palace Yard and hearing
the voice grow more thundrous as he advances, pictures to himself a
man in a towering rage. Reaching House he will, find upright
behind Treasury Bench a man decently dressed in black, without
the slightest flash of expression on his face, roaring with volume of
sound that would cause to blush any stray bull of Bashan, medita-
tively making its way down Sauciehall Street, pricking up its ears at
the reverberation brought northward across the timorous Tweed.
As CAwm EL-BANNERMAN, suffering on the bench below, observed
“It really doesn't seem fair that a man should, with º placid
face and mien, continuously roar in this fashion. he were in
Glasgae under this Police Bill, he would immediately be wrapped up
in a decent cloth and fined forty shillings.” - - -
Business done.—Asquith moves for leave to bring in Welsh Dis-
establishment Bill. “Sheer political cant of the most nauseous
kind,” was HICKs-BEACH's genial description of HomE SECRETARY's
argument.
Tuesday.--"The world,” said, CHESNEY, speaking just now in
debate on EveRETT's motion, “is divided into two classes, people who
understand the subject, and le who do not. The former are all
bimetallist, the latter are gradually going over.”
I fancy I must be going over; certainly I don't understand the
subject. Thankful, therefore, for opportunity, to hear EveRETT
discourse on it. A tall, grave-looking man, with, a touch of sad-
ness suggestive of long brooding over bimetallic theories. In full-
ness of design to instruct House, went back all the way to JULIUS
CESAR. Finally arrived in Garden of Eden; recalled fact that origi-
nally, intime of º peace and prosperity, two peºple walked in it.
This principle of duality ran through everything. “There are, for
:*. said EveRETT, swinging his pince-nez between finger and
thumb in convincing manner, “white corn", and red corn, white

two purposes, he pitched his voice in a key upon which, whilst osten-
grapes and black grapes.” (“White sand and grey sand,” hummed

“We are created in two sexes,” EveRETT continued, half closing
his eyes and paying no attention to the voice of the scorner; “whose
hi; urpose is fulfilled only when they are married.”
ere H. opened his eyes and glanced significantly at MAGUIRE.
Rochfort blushed. Wished he hadn't interfered. ...
These arguments, new in controversy of long standing, proved sur-
prisingly conclusive. SQUIRE of MALwood spoke, for hour and a
half, vehemently declaring that he would have nothing to do with
bimetallism, would not touch it with a pair of tongs.
“Sorry to interrupt the right hon. gentleman,” said EVERETT;
“but he has just alluded to another instance of the infinitude of the
principle of duality. Did any hon. Member ever see a tong P No,
always a pair. Toujours two, as the French say.”
SquEEE finished up by announcing he would accept Eye RETT's
amendment, though most careful to protest that it really meant
nothing, least of all approval of the heresy of bimetallism.
“You may say what you please,” said Court.NEx; “so long as you
take our resolution.”
Then the bimetallists jubilantly went home arm in arm.
“Arm in arm, of course,” said EveRETT, driving off in a pair-
wheeled hansom. , “Still another illustration of the irresistible
illimitable principle of duality. Wish, by the way, I'd mentioned
when on the subject that the result of marriage is occasionally twins.
One of those things—or should I say two of those things?– a fellow
always thinks of on the staircase.”
Business done.—SQUIRE of MALwood, swearing he would ne'er
consent to bimetallism, consented to adopt resolution put forward by
Friday, 2 A.M.–Few people know, even suspect, what takes place
here when we have a “nicht wi' Burns,” or rather an early morning.
Not known, because few Southerners remain to witness orgie: no
English paper reports it. ...According to beneficent Standing Qrder,
ordinary debate stands adjourned at midnight. Members go home,
whether work in hand accomplished or not. One curious exception
to rule. , Scotch Members, accustomed to get a little more for their
money than other sections of community, managed to carry amend-
ment whereby matters relating to educational affairs North of the
Tweed may be discussed all night if necessary. Accordingly, from
time to time, when ordinary business of sitting wound up, Scotch
Members clan together and make a night of it.
º just now. At midnight Welsh Disestablishment Bill
brought in; Members troop off leaving what Jox, M irreverently calls
“a Pict selection of Scots.” Business on hand related to Universities
(Scotland) Act, 1889. So itNº. on Order. First business actually
is to bring in the haggis. MACFARLANE told off for this duty, because
he’s only member who, being resident in London, has his kilt handy.
Also there is a subtle, inexpressed feeling that his flowing beard (when
it can be kept out of the haggis-dish) gives a bardic appearance to
ceremony. Dr. FARQUBARson preceeds him with bagpipes, which
seemed to-night to have just a slight touch of influenza. CALDwell
brews a peck o' maut; "Cald without” they call it, in spite of the
rising steam and the stirred-up sugar. But a Scotchman, as DoNALD
CURRIE admits, is not to be done out of a joke on account of a few
awkward details in the way of matters of fact. No pipes are allowed
except those in FARQUHARson's, hands, but they manage to face
deprivation, and have, on the whole, a merry evening. Joining hands
round table, on which lay the astonished Mace, we sang “Auld Lang
Syne” just now, and so home to bed.
Don't quite know what became of the Universities (Scotland) Act,
1889. Fancy we repealed it. Business done (earlier in sitting). —
Welsh Disestablishment Bill brought in.

eighty per cent, of flour and sago, and the rest genuine nibs, deserves

is that we are not allowed to bet in the old.

it, there was something amazingly demoralis-

every single sweep in the old Handicap for
fifteen years, and never once drew a starter.

heard whether there is to be any substitute
for the º this wear?
Second Mem. Why, yes... I was told by a
member of the Recreation Committee that all
members taking the bread-and-milk luncheon
daily for a week are to have chances for the
Grand Derby Race Christmas Tree.
JFirst Mem. Isn't a Christmas Tree a little
too late or too previous in June?
Second Mem. Well, yes; but then it was
said that once the Derby was run in a snow-
storm, and so we might take it that some-
times we have winter in summer.
First Mem. I see. Have you any idea what
the prizes are to be?
Second Mem. Oh, some of them will be very
handsome. I am told that the tree is to be
decorated with tea-cozies and silver-mounted
blue spectacles.
First Mem. Really l, I shall not forget to
take my one o'clock bread-and-milk regu-
*: in the º for the next week.
suppose you have quite given up your
betting-book?
Second Mem. Well, no, because you see
the Act permits betting in moderation, and
under proper restrictions. For instance, I
am quite p to take seven to one against
Snuffboar for the Hardbake Selling Stakes,
only of course it must be in peppermint drops.
First Mem. (producing betting-book). Well,
I would accommodate you if I were not
overburdened with peppermint-drops. Make
it brandy-halls, and I will do it in ounces.
Second Mem. (referring to betting-book). I
am not particularly fond of that sweetstuff,
but I think I can act as commissioner for my
aunt. (Enters bet.) Is your list full for The
Band of Joy Two-year-old Caudle º:
First Mem. (after reference to betting-
book). Well, I don't mind backing my opinion
about the Churchwarden's County Council.
Do you know his price?
Second Mem; I see in the Charity Boz of
last night that he was in considerable demand
at Tattersall's. As much as two to one in
Abyssinian sugar-sticks was taken freely. I
don’t mind letting you have a pound of mixed
biscuits to an ounce of Everton toffy, if that
will suit wou.
First Mem. All right. (Makes entry in
betting-book.) And now I really must go.
First Mem. What, are you off?
Second Mem. Why, yes. I want to seemy
stockbroker. I have quite a heavy flutter on
in connection with these new Carbonate of
|Soda Mines. If they don't go up a bit before
the next account I may lose a cool thousand.

each of us two eyes for the common purpose of sight, two ears
to hear withal, two hands and two legs.” (“What about the Isle
of Man?” asked Roomront Maume. “Understand they have
three legs there.”) - -
“We are created in two sexes,” EveRETT continued, half closing
his eyes and paying no attention to the voice of the scorner; “whose
highest purpose is fulfilled only when they are married.”
ere he opened his eyes and glanced significantly at MAGUIRE.
Rochfort blushed. Wished he hadn't interfered. ..
These arguments, new in controversy of long standing, proved sur-
risingly conclusive. SQUIRE of MALwood spoke for hour and a
# vehemently declaring that he would have nothing to do with
bimetallism, would not touch it with a pair of tongs. .
“Sorry to interrupt the right hon. gentleman,” said EveRETT;
“but he has just alluded to another instance of the infinitude of the
principle of duality. Did any hon. Member ever see a tong P No,
always a pair. Toujours two, as the French say.”
SquEEE finished up by announcing he would accept EveRETT's
amendment, though most careful to protest that it really meant
nothing, least of all approval of the heresy of bimetallism.
“You may say what you please,” said Court.NEy; “so long as you
take our resolution.”
Then the bimetallists jubilantly went home arm in arm.
“Arm in arm, of course,” said Eye RETT, driving off in a pair-
wheeled hansom. “Still another illustration of the irresistible
illimitable principle of duality. Wish, by the way, I’d mentioned
when on the subject that the result of marriage is occasionally twins.
One of those things—or should I say two of those things?– a fellow
always thinks of on the staircase.”
Business done.--SQUIRE OF MALwood, swearing he would ne'er
consent to bimetallism, consented to adopt resolution put forward by
Friday, 2 A.M.–Few people know, even suspect, what takes place
here when we have a “nicht wi' Burns,” or rather an early morning.
Not known, because few Southerners remain to witness orgie: no
English paper reports it. ...According to beneficent Standing Qrder,
ordinary debate stands adjourned at midnight. Members go home,
whether work in hand accomplished or not. One curious exception
to rule. , Scotch Members, accustomed to get a little more for their
money than other sections of community, managed to carry amend-
ment whereby matters relating to educational affairs North of the
Tweed may be discussed all night if necessary. Accordingly, from
time to time, when ordinary business of sitting wound up, Scotch
Members clan together and make a night of it.
º !. now. At midnight Welsh Disestablishment Bill
brought in ; Members troop off leaving what JokIM irreverently calls
“a Pict selection of Scots.” Business on hand related to Universities
(Scotland) Act, 1889. So it appears on Order. First business actually
is to bring in the haggis. MACFARLANE told off for this duty, because
he’s only member who, being resident in London, has his kilt handy.
Also there is a subtle, inexpressed feeling that his flowing beard (when
it can be kept out of the haggis-dish) gives a bardic appearance to
ceremony. Dr. FARQUHARson preceeds him with bagpipes, which
seemed to-night to have just a slight touch of influenza. CALDwell
brews a peck o' maut; “Cald without” they call it, in spite of the
rising steam and the stirred-up sugar. But a Scotchman, as DoNALD
CURRIE admits, is not to be done out of a joke on account of a few
awkward details in the way of matters of fact. No pipes are allowed
except those in FARQUHARson's hands, but they manage to face
deprivation, and have, on the whole, a merry evening. Joining hands
round table, on which lay the astonished Mace, we sang “Auld Lang
Syne” just now, and so home to bed.
Don't quite know what became of the Universities (Scotland) Act,
1889. Fancy we repealed it. Business done (earlier in sitting).-
Welsh Disestablishment Bill brought in.
Friday, Midnight.—Best day's work since, Session opened. At
morning sitting Asquith moved for leave to bring in two important
measures, and got it. If things go on at this rate HomE SrcketARY
will soon be known as Ask-witH-SUCCESs. At night useful discus-
sion on Post Office contract with Telephone Company. When SAGE
of QUEEN ANNE's GATE interposed everybody thought he was going
to show that all the evil dilated upon came from having PREMIER in
the House of Lords. Didn't even mention RoseBERY, unless he
meant to include him in condemnation of “financiers and other dis-
reputable persons.”

THE jocund spring, in season ripe,
Her reign of gladness hath commenced,
Each shepherd mends his broken pipe,
Each nymph knows we
The subtle spell.
By which she'll soon be influenz'ed.
Then tarry not, belovèd maid,
Nor make thy worshipper endure.
Such woes as haunt him who's afraid,

To think Love's fires
Alone have raised his temperature!
What though the crocus still delays?
No fragrance hath it sweet or rare;
The snowdrop pale let others praise;
e need not yet
The violet -
When eucalyptus fills the air!
Away with winter's peevish woes!
We'll wander though the meadows green
Or where the babbling river flows,
And on the brink
We'll sit and drink
Ambrosial tincture of quinine.

AIR-" Battle of the Baltic.”
OF Stoppa RT-splendid name!—
Sing the rapturous renown,
en our boys to battle came,
All to win the Cricket Crown;
Though Australia once again the toss had
won.
But the Britons took their stand
In a bold determined band,
And the Best Bat in the Land
Led them on.
Like “Leviathan” in form,
Little GREGoRY laid on,
Doughty DARLING made it warm,
And GEORGE GIFFEN, fadeless one,
Smote our trundlers with a coolness quite
sublime.
Four—One—Four. The “wire” so saithl—
There was silence deep as death,
And our boldest held º breath
For a time.
But the hopes of England flushed
On that mighty Melbourne green;
How young WARD and StopDART rushed
..O'er the space those stumps between 1
Sixty-eight our Captain piled, and the fun
lMACLAREN kept alive;
With Six-Score! Bob PEEL did strive,
And our score was Three—Eight—Five
Ere 'twas done!
Australia once again!
And the scoring does not slack.
May kind heaven avert the rain,
Till the last bathies him back!
At good shots how the cheers break and boom
Round the ring !—and oh! the wail
At the click of flying bail,
As the Richardsonian hail
Pelts—like doom!
Good GREY GEORGE, the Australian Chief,
Smote again his swashing blows.
Mingled sounds of joy and grief
From the Melbourne ring arose!
When : stumps again are drawn for the

BRockwell, prey to bad luck's blight,
Is again out of the fight,
WARD and STODDART in, to smite

Old World, let thine echoes wake
With the honoured name of BRown
Yokº *ows the last selected, but not

With Lancashire's great gun
ALBERT WARD, to share the fun
Was a feast !

Though, for once, stout Stoddart failed,
That left few more runs, dye see? .
And though TRoTT and GIFFEN hailed
At the stumps, and JARVIs watched like a cat,
Young MAcLAREN and Bob PEEL
Won the match slap off the reel,
By six wickets! #. d've feel

And we echo him o'er the wave),

IN THE COURT OF COMMON SENSE (LATE PLEAS).
(Before Mr. Justice Reason.)
HIs Lordship asked whether Brown v. Jones was ready?
M. Bands. No, my Lord. I am requested by my learned friend,
Mr...WIgGF (who is in the Strand), to say that unfortunately—
|His Lºrdship (interrupting). Oh, very well! if the parties do not
take sufficient interest in the matter to appear here at the proper
time, I shall assume that the whole affair is frivolous, and strike it
out. Next case please.
A Mr. SMITH rose in the body of the Court and said that he
appeared in person.
His Lordship. Is the defendant here? -
Mr. Bands. I appear for the defendant, my Lord, Mr. Snooks.
Allow me to say that—
His, Lordship (interrupting). No, no, Mr. BANDs; your turn will
come by-and-by. I will hear what the plaintiff has to say first.
Now you, Sir-I mean Mr. SMITH-what is it all about?
The plaintiff then entered into a lengthy narrative of certain
negotiations about the purchase of a house.
His Lordship (interrupting). Do you want to buy the place, now? will
Mr. Smith. No, my Lord, at least—
His Lordship. You said no, and I suppose you meant what you
said, And now, Mr. BANDs, does you client want to sell the house?
.Mr. Bands (promptly). Certainly not, my Lord; but perhaps you
allow me to explain.
Hº Lºrdship. Explanation absolutely uſinecessary. No order,
and Mr. SNooks, as he has gone to the expense of instructing (to my
mind absolutely unnecessarily) counsel, will have the pleasure of

n...this instance both the litigants appeared in person. The
question in dispute was a right-of-way.
His Lordship. Now, gentlemen, although you have elected to
appear before me without any intermediary, I am bound to tell you
that if the matter is carried further—to superior courts—you will
find jº." both landed in heavy costs. What do you say,
Mr. Johnson f
Mr. Johnsºn, (one of the litigants). Well, of course, my Lord, I
don't want that; but if I win my cause, why Mr. Thompson will

feeling in this matter, Take my advice and settle it amicably. I
do not sit on this bench to encourage gambling, but if either of you
has in his possession, what I believe was called by Mr. Box in the
case of Boz versus Cor, a “tossing” sixpence, you might come to
an understanding in five minutes. I will wait until you have con-
ferred with one another. -
The litigants upon this invitation held a consultation.
Mr. Johnson. It is all right, my Lord. I called heads, and—
His Lordship (interrupting). I don't want to hear anything about
that so long as Box and Cox–I should say, Johnson and THoMP-
son—are satisfied, the rest is immaterial. And now, is there any
further business before me?
His Lordship was informed that there were ten causes to be heard,
and that all the parties were in attendance.
His Lordship. Am I to understand that not only counsel but their
clients are present.
Mr. Bands (after consultation). Certainly, my Lord.
IIis Lordship. Then allow me to address them en bloc. Now I
am quite sure that a few minutes' conversation amongst yourselves
ill set everything right. Commence with the very sensible
assumption that anything is better than litigation, and see what
comes of it. I will retire to my room to let you have a chat in com-
fort. When you are all ready, send for me. But mind, take my
advice, and hold to the sensible assumption that anything is better
than litigation.
His Lordship then retired, and the parties interested acted §.
his suggestion. After a quarter of an hour's conference the Judge
was summoned into Court.
II is Lordship. Well, and what is the decision?
Mr. Bands (in a melancholy tone). May it please your Lordship
all the cases have been settled out of court.
His Lordship. So much the better. And now as I have cleared off
my entire list, I bid you an affectionate farewell.
The Court was then adjourned sine die.

I.—THE PINK HIPPOPOTAMUS. (concluded.)
A DIM mysterious light was burning in the stall of the sacred
animal. By its rays I was able to see not only the hippopotamus
itself, but also the gaping hole in the skylight through which
GANDERDown and I been thus fortuitously projected into its
manger. The walls I noticed were thickly ºld with gold slabs,
on which were chased mystic emblems connected with the cult of the
gigantic beast., Here and there a glittering point caught the light
and gave it forth again in a thousand fantastic iridescent rays. One
of these was above * head, and as I gazed at it I reali that it
was a huge ruby of the first water. In the manger itself were lyin
shivered fragments of the skylight. I picked one of these up #:
all possible circumspection. It was a magnificent piece of the very
finest diamond. ithout another word I crammed all I could laym
hands upon into my pockets and those of GANDERDown. Then
paused to reflect.
The situation was not an easy one.
§: but how should we contrive to get away with our booty 2 No
oubt we could manage to elude the vigilance of the guards if we
returned alone. But this was not to be thought of. Either we would
take the hippopotamus with us or perish, where we lay. I com-
municated my resolve to my companion, and, as I expected, obtained
his emphatic approval. at then was to be done?
All this time, I should state, the huge object of our adventure was
calmly munching his evening meal of soaked rice within three inches
of the place where GANDERDown and I lay huddled up together. I
saw his immense jaws rise and fall with the regularity of some
enormous machine, and I was able to look right down into the
cavernous recesses of his being. His eyes twinkled occasionally with
a sidelong look at us, but he seemed calm and undisturbed, as #:
AND
We had arrived, indeed, at our H
with his rice there was double bonne bouche waiting for himjin.the
corner of his manger.
At this moment the shrill voic "of a Muezzin sounded weirdl
through the stillness o' the summer night. Three times he called,
and then once again al was still. Aminute or so afterwards I heard
a dull tramp, as of a regiment, ...; towards the place in which we
were sheltered. What could it mean? I took out my watch. The
hour was fifteen minutes after midnight. And then, by a sudden
effort of memory, I remembered that the dear old MEEBHoy had told
me that at this hour every night a crowd of fanatical priests and
attendants, armed every one of them to the very teeth, came to the
stable of their sacred brute in order to take him out for an hour's
romenade through the groves and avenues that surround his shrine.
he danger, then, was imminent. If we were discovered nothing
could save us, and we should perish miserably with our prize within
our §. My mind was instantly made up.

ever; but I was once told by a di
horse—why, I know not, as the attempt for a man of my size—
“Enough of that, GANDERDown ; you have got somehow or other
to get inside this hippopotamus.”
“All right,” said the major, who, as I have said, never displayed
the least trace of emotion; “all right. I suppose i had better take
my boots off,” and, suijing the action to the words, he did so.
“Stay,” iſ murmured." *...; a long leather thong P’’
“Here is one,” he replied, producing it; “I never travel without
one. You never know what may come in u .”
I took it from him and bade him º: for the plunge. Nearer
and nearer sounded the tramp of the advancing priests. I judged
that we had exactly three minutes left, and I told GANDERDown that
the next time the animal's jaws were open to their widest he was to
o down head first, and trust to providence and me for the rest.
ANDERDown needed no further incitement. Kissing a locket con-
taining a specimen of his wife's hair he extended his arms above his
head in correct diving attitude, and, as the gigantic mouth opened
slowly, sprang forward and in a moment º within this living
vault. As he did so, I passed a loop of the leather thong firmly over
the beast's lower i. fitting it in where there are gaps in the teeth.
As I anticipated, he did not notice this, being entirely taken up with
the surprise of receiving his human cargo. I then took the ends of
the thong in my hands, and, as the step of the leading priest sounded
at the door, I, too, leaped into the cavity in which GANDERDown had
so bravely preceded me.
There are some things in my life that I do not care to dwell upon.
Description, however vividly it may serve to paint the dauntless
courage that has ever borne me safe through dangers, can only give
me pain by recalling to me the horrors and the terrors through which
I had to pass. The inside of the Pink Hippopotamus was one of
these awful situations. . Let it suffice to say that I found GANDER-
Down alive, but stertorous, and that I was able to relieve him by
undoing his shirt-collar. I had my compass, I had a pair of excel-
lent reins. Why say more? To this day the Ghazis and Mollahs, and
the tribe of Hippo-worshippers who are still to be found inhabiting
the rocky mountain fastnesses of Jam Tirnova, have been unable to
realise why the beast they prayed to should have suddenly taken it
into his head, some forty years ago, to make straight for the Dia-
* City instead of returning, as was his wont, to his gilded stall.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BAIL UP!
A CoRRESPONDENT, who has been reading
GRAY's "Elegy,” says there is a reference to
the England v. Australia match in it. He
quotes the line—
“How jocund did they drive their team afield !”
as proving his point. The allusion to “drives,”
“teams,” and “fielding,” he remarks, can
hardly be ºniº And if they could,
the following line settles the matter:-
“How bow'd the wood beneath their sturdy
stroke!”
Didn't the wood bow and bend when BRown
was in, he asks? Wasn't WARD's on-drive
for five a sturdy stroke? We must refer him
to Mr. Stoddart for a reply.
PsALTER AND SALTA.—Aided by the careful
arrangement of “contents” (and with regard
to “Mr. G.'s” latest publication there are no
| “non-contents”) the reader can easily find any
passage in this . Psalter.” At this moment
ithere is another “Salta” to which the atten-
ition of not a few is directed, and the non-con-
tents or anti-Jabezites know that it is very
difficult to get at him, or to find a passage
ſout of that Salta for J. B.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THE Baron is not aware whether the
volume before him, Japhet in Search of a
Father, is the first of Captain MARRYAT's
works re-issued by MACMILLAN ; but the
Baron aking on behalf of Mr. Punch, is
indeed delighted to welcome a very old
friend, and hopes to see many more of Cap-
tain MARRYAT's able and amusing crew. “If
the gallant Captain, R.N., with his true
British sailors, cannot command a sale, who
can P” asks the Baron, and pauses not for a
reply. . It is to be ho that Midshipman

re-issue, and success to it, quoth the nautical
BARON DE Book-WoRMs.
Good OMEN.—One of the Directors of a
New Water Company is Sir SPENCER WELLs,
Everyone well knows the genuine value o
the Sparkling Wells. Will the worthy Bart.,
as the Mädchens do at the Elisa Fountain,
serve out “the Harefield” (not Hare-aērated)
“and Springwell” waters at a much-fre-
quented bar, and be thenceforth known as
Sir Dis-pensary WELLs? We wish them all
success. “Water, water, everywhere, and
TO MRS. KEELEY.
[“Some time ago HER MAJESTY inquired after
Mrs. KEELEY, and was informed that she was well
and in her ninetieth year. The QUEEN expressed
a wish to see her, and Colonel Collins arranged
for Mrs. KEELEY to have the honour of being re-
ceived at Buckingham Palace yesterday afternoon,
when she was presented to HER MAjesty. The
welcome given to the gifted lady, who so wonder-
fully preserves her health, intelligence, andvivacity,
was most graceful and cordial; and the QUEEN
was pleased to recall to mind several interesting
incidents of the past.”—Daily Telegraph, Thurs-
day, March 7.]
OH, when I was a little Eton boy
4. With a heigho! I need not explain,
“The KEELEYs” were a wondrous joy,
For they were so droll in every play.
But now I am at mid estate,
With a heigho! I need not explain,
Here's Mrs. KEELEY tete-à-tête
With our Gracious Queen WIc-To-R1-A.
No Betsy Baker ere like you!
With a smile, smirk, I need not explain!
That rascal, gay Jack Sheppard, too,
With a “ Nir, my dolly'ſ fake away!”
I’ve seen you dance and heard you sing
With a sly eye, I need not explain,
How well you acted .#
In whatever part you chose to play !
That you're about and well we know,
With a Hooray! a cheer once again!
And may you long continue so
the curtain fails and ends the play.

Counsel. Now tell me, while you were
standing as you say just in front of the de-
fendant, did anything remarkable strike you?
Pat. It did, §or.

those who witnessed it. It was, or should have been, like with-

Then ToMMY, thus called upon, makes his speech.

Ministry gone through long succession of crises since Session
opened. Pulled through somehow; but this new unsuspected flank
attack, seemed irresistibly fatal. The buzzing of the B's was so
interminable, 'ANBURY was so hangry, that it seemed there really
must be some fire under the smoke. Sidney HERBERT chivalrously
came to assistance of political adversaries, thanking First Com-
missioner on behalf of Kitchen Committee for what he had done.
The B's, fearful of consequences of this diversion, hurried on
division; if the thing was to be done, must be done quickly.
Approach of dinner-hour had drawn away Members; critical division
unexpected. HANBURY beheld vision of butler in Berkeley Square
entering PREMIER's sick room with basin of beef-tea and the message,
“My Lord, the Government's hoff.” ToMMY Bowles began to
think what coat he should wear when the QUEEN sent for him.
House cleared for division; tellers returning made known that

rushing the ministerial majority at a single bound up to 149.

There is nothing ToMMY Bowles doesn't know. If there were,
BARTLEY would supply omission. Performance a little hampered by
accident of GQLDSMID's being in Chair. Something about JULIAN
depressing to high spirits. When he takes Chair and submits vote,
he succeeds in some subtle way in investing the proceedings with
unmistakable church service associations. He intones the vote,
and when, having put the question, he adds, “The Ayes have it,” it
i. exactly as in another place it is remarked, “Here endeth the first
esson.”
ToMMY B. doesn't mind that. He would as soon gambol in a church
as on the quarter-deck. But it's different with GeoRGE CRIsto-
fi ed sibly during dinner-hour there may be noticeable a certain
x
what we’ve long been accustomed to.
Business done.—Busy B's took care that not too many Votes in
Supply should be granted.
A WARM LAMENT.
(In one of the recent Intervals of Sunshine.)
O PASSER-BY, I prithee hark to me!
You wonder, maybe, why my eyelids glisten
With clinging dewy teardrops, salt as sea.
I'll tell the story of my sadness. Listen!
The Arctic cold we've had so much of late
Made every fibre of my body quiver;
I struggled hard against relentless fate,
Then I decided I would no more shiver.
And that’s just it. My grief now knows no bounds
It crushes me; I don't know how to bear it.
I bought a new fur coat for fifteen pounds,
And now it’s got so hot I cannot wear it
QUEER QUERIES.—DAMP AND DEPREssion.—I see that they
have discovered a “Marsh Willage” near Glastonbury. Would it be
of any use to write to the Society of Antiquaries and tell them about
our village, and ask them to come and inspect it? I don't think
§§ could well be much marshier. ... Even the ducks here suffer
badly from rheumatism (which they don't try to suppress)...We live
all the year round on deep clay, and just at present on charity. The
one thing that Soke-in-the-Mire never sees is dust. But it would
gladly see the antiquaries, who would impart a much-needed stimulus
to local trade, and could be well housed at the village inn, which is

Bus-conductors, shopmen, cabbies,

Not to “try it on” 's been given me
Once or twice.

Half-a-crown,
You might be of use and save a

or you'd find yourself right quickly
In the slot,
Were you of the right dimensions—
But you're not.
I’m beginning to assume a
ang-dog air;
For I feel my conduct’s hardly
“On the square.”
Now I leave church early (though I
Get there late),
Lest I may be moved to put you
In the platel
That last spark of decent feeling
Ipossess,
But my character you’ve ruined,
More or less:

THE NEW HEN.
(A Fable.)
A NEW Hen wandering disconso-
lately in a country farmyard once
made the acquaintance of a cock of
the old school, when both fell into
somediscourse concerning the changes
of the modes.
“Ah,” said the former, arrogantly
addressing the latter, “times are
indeed a good deal altered since you
were a cockerel, and all for the better,
thank goodness! Time was, and not
so very long ago either, when I was
:*. to do nothing save lay eggs
and breed chickens: now, however,
my mistress must know better than
to expect such degrading offices of
me, for I will neither lay the one nor
breed the other.”
The old cock was about to offer
some remarks in ridicule of these
sentiments, when the housewife came
into the yard, and, snatching up the
New Hen, wrung her neck, remark-
ing to herself as she did so, that a
fowl that could neither lay eggs nor
rear chickens, had obviously no place
in the economy of nature.

The oyster is an arch-deceiver,
And makes its eater's certain lot
A bad attack of typhoid fever.
With soup then, he it thick or clear,
The banquet fitly may commence—
Alas, on second thºughts, I fear
With soup as well we must dispense.
The doctors urge that, in effect,
Soup simply kills the thoughtless glutton,
It's full of germs. I recollect
They say the same of beef and mutton.
Yes, each variety of meat,
As you remark, is much the same,
And we're forbidden now to eat
Fish, oysters, poultry, joint or game.
But though a Nemesis each brings,
The punishment, the doctors tell, is

Yet ample evidence we find
To make us, DAMon, look on cheese
As simply poison to mankind;
While those who may desire to pass
Immediately o'er Charon's ferry,
Have but to take a daily glass
Of claret, hock, champagne or sherry.
Who fain would live a year at least,
Reluctantly must modify
The scope of our projected feast;
A charcoal biscuit we will share,
Water (distilled, of course.) we'll swallow,
Since this appears the only fare
On which destruction will not follow !
SHAKSPEARE REWISED BY AN ALDERMAN.
“MAY I ask,” said the worthy Alderman
DAVIES, and he might have added, “I ask
because “I)A viks sum, non CEdipus’”—but
he didn't, and it was a chance lost, “what
salary you [the witness under examination]
rec ived for this conduct of yours while
secretary?” To which witness answered,
“4,500 a year, and a bonus of £200.” Where-
upon the Alderman remarked, “Then all I
can say is, you could have got many honest
men to do the work for much less.”
Quite so, Mr. Alderman, true for you; but
if a man will act honestly for a sovereign,
what might not the addition of ten shillings
do? It otight to make him more honest com-
paratively, while another ten shillings would
make him superlatively honest. But how if
there were an obligation attached to the in-
crease? Just a trifling deviation out of the
straight course to begin with, to oblige a
patron?
Let honesty be the drug in the market,
and the rare herb dishonesty will be at a
premium. It is gratifying to be assured, on
aldermanic authority, that SHAKSPEARE was
wrong, and that in future for Hamlet’s well-
world goes is to be as one man picked out of
ten thousand,” we must read “For to be
dishonest as this world goes is to be as one
man picked out of ten thousand.”
Happy Alderman DAVIEs! In what para-
disiacal pastures must he have moved and
breathed and earned his livelihood!
CIRCLING THE SQUARE.
STANDING awhile at the corner crossing,
Watching a van as it lumbers past,
Something impels me to turn and saunter
Down to the Square, where I met you, last.
Down to the Square with its formal garden

Somehow I never łº since been near it,
Things have all changed since last Julyl
There is the gate, where you fumbled sadly
Turning the ... I lent my aid–
There . the paths, where we strolled in sun-
shline,
There is our seat in the chestnut shade.
Borders all empty, and paths uncared for,
Bleak, bare branches, and murky sky-
This is the “garden I love” no longer,
How it has changed since last July 1
All that we spoke of, or left unspoken,
All that our tongues or our eyes could say
Comes to me now, as the Square I circle,
Clear as events but of yesterday.
Wain to remember, to care still vainer,
You have been married a month, and I-
I’m a misogynist—just at present,
How we have changed since last July!

That for early morning there's no place like bed!
...With their early to bed and their early to rise,
They’ve tortured the good, and tormented the wise.
In sermons, and spelling-books, proverbs and tracts,
And now they just find they’ve mistaken the facts!
“It's just like those moralists! Talk stilted bosh
For an aeon or two, and then find it won't wash!

Whilst our old foe, the lark, proves pure fiddle-de-dee.

The fact only proves that you’re foolish or old?

LAst week the name of Mr. REDFord as newly-appointed Licenser of
Plays was announced. This is just to the late Licenser's assistant and
deputy. But if the office is to be continued, why should it not be
thrown open to competitive examination ? A paper of such questions
as the following would secure a learned Theban for the office:–
1. Who was the Licenser of Plays in the time of SHAKsprAREP
2. Translate passages (given) from (a) French dramatists, (8) Italian,
(?) German, (6) Spanish, (..) Norwegian, (C) Russian, (7) Japanese.
3. Translate passages (given) from the works of English drama-
tists into the above-mentioned languages... . -
4. Give }. opinion on the following “situations” and “plots,”
and say whether you consider it in the interests of public morality
that they should be licensed for performance or not.
5. State your reasons for such opinions.
6. Is it your opinion that an officer of the Licensing (Play) Depart-
ment should beinattendance every night at everytheatre (astall being
kept for him by the manager on pain of fine or forfeiture of licence) to
note if any change or any introduction be made in the dialogue or in
any part or portion of the play already licensed? And if not, why not?
7. Would it be, or not, advisable in your opinion that every author,
or all the authors when collaborating, should read their own pieces
aloud to the Licenser, giving as much action and dramatic illustra-
tion as space will allow? And that the low comedians and eccentric
comedians, male and female, with songs and dances, should attend, and
show (a) what steps they propose taking in thenew piece, (b) what words,
(c) winks, (d) becks, and (e) wreathed smiles § intend giving in
order to point an innuendo or adorn an apparently harmless joke
8. Do you think that, as an assistant judge on such occasions, one
or more experts (at so much an hour) should be present?
9. (a) In your opinion should not every play be seen by the Licenser,
duly acted, with the costumes, before a licence can be granted P(b) and
then that theiicence begranted only on the condition that no alteration

COURTLY QUADRUPEDS.
(To the Editor of the “Sp-et-tor.”)
SIR,--I am sure you will be
glad to have another veracious
story about Animal Etiquette.
During the recent frost we
hung a bone up in the garden
for the starving birds to peck
at, and one of our dogs—a
collie-was mean enough to
steal it. Next day we noticed
him limping, and were sur-
prised to find a great gash
across one of his paws. I at
once understood what had hap-
pened., Our other dogs had
evidently thought stealing the
bone under the circumstances
was very bad form, and the
collie had been cut by them.'
Yours sympathetically,
PARISH PUMP.
SIR,-Ifind thateven kittens
have a code, of etiquette, and
understand theniceties.of social
rank. The other day our kit-
ten was on the table, when a
winged creature which I took
for a fly settled just in front
of it. ... Pussy immediately
gracefully retreated back-
wards till, on arriving at the Vºß
edge, she slid to the ground.
At first I put down her be-
haviour to fright, but it was

nothing of the sort. It was a
pure act of courtesy. The sup-
posed fly... was a lady-bird!
Our intelligent little animal
had shown her instinctive re-
spect for title and sex, which
was naturally very gratifying
to an ardent
PRIMRose LEAGUER.
SIR,-Our terrier killed a

him, for no obvious reason,
approach the rat-hole again.
We all agreed that he must be

WADE MECUM FOR A CERTAIN COURT OFFICIAL.
. Question. Your duty, I believe, is to protect the public from receiv-
ing impressions—from your point of view—of a pernicious character?
Answer. Certainly; and this I accomplish by reading and rejecting
what I think the public should avoid.
Q. How long has the office been in existence?
4. About a century or so.
Q. How did the public get on before your office came into existence?
4. Fairly well, especially in the days of SHAkspeaRe.
hi % º the Bard of Avon to obtain a licence for the production of
1s plays
4. No; they were then practically edited by the public.
..Q. Could not the public edit plays in the reign of Queen Victor[A
with the intelligence displayed in the days of “Good Queen BEss”?
4. It is impossible to say, as the question has not been tested by
experiment.
Q. You say that your duty is to preserve the purity of the public
taste; was that also the object of the earlier of your predecessors?
4. Seemingly not, as the office was called into existence to serve as a
bar to the dissemination of opinions of an entirely political character.
Q. But that is not now the raison d'être of the appointment?
4. Oh, no; for nowadays, thanks to the newspapers, politics
enjoys free trade.
Q. But still, the right of interference exists?
4. Yes, but it is only used to prevent a performer from “making
up”, as a Cabinet Minister, to the annoyance of the right hon.
gentleman favoured with the attention.
Q. Is there any rule to guide the use of the official blue pencil P
4...None in particular. That emblem of concrete authority may
be diligently used for a decade, and then be laid aside for a quarter
of a century.
Q. Then there is no policy in the office?
4. None to speak of. What was wrong in 1875 may be right in 1895,
and may be wrong again at the commencement of the next century.
Q. But surely such an office has not gained the entire applause of
the London Press?
A. On the contrary, the all but universal condemnation.
Q. And yet when the office became vacant there were many
journalistic applicants?
A. Because journalists accept the situation of the hour, and make
the best of it.
Q. Is it possible that the candidates who have failed may find
their objection to the existence of the office stronger than ever?
4. It is not only possible, but probable.
Q: And thus any non-journalist who accepts the appointmºnt may

AIR-" The Cane-bottom'd Chair.”
AH-H-H-H !!!, Farewell to the Chair, to the Mace, to the Bar!
To tedious twaddle and purposeless jarl-
Away from the House, and its toils, and its cares,
I hope to sit snug in my snuggest of chairs.
To mount that old Chair was my pride, to be sure;
But-the House got ill-mannered, its air grew impure:
And the sights I have seen there on many a day
Were worthy a lot of young Yahoos at play.
Ah! yet that old Chamber had corners and nooks,
Which seemed haunted by friendly, familiar old spooks.
The GossETTs, O'Gormans, and GLADston Es! All ends!
But escaping old bothers means missing old friends.
Qld chums, like old china, º ossibly cracked,
With rickety tempers, and wits #.
Old memory treasures. And when shall men see
Such champions as DIzzy and W. G. "
No better divan need § ABBAs require
Than this snug Easy Chair well drawn up to the fire.
Off robes! Wig avaunt! Now I’m cosy!—And yet,
If there's something to gladden, there’s much to regret.
Why is it one clings to some genial old scamp?
Why is it one sticks to a worn-out old gamp?
Why is it, despite my relief, I feel drawn
To that hard high-backed Chair I so long sat upon P
Long, long through the hours, and the night, and the chimes
Have I sat, yawned and ached in the tire ome old times,
When faction and fog filled the House, and for me
Now comfort and quiet will gladden my rest,
And tedium no º will torture my breast,
For that finest of Seats ever padded with hair
I am going to exchange for my own Easy Chair!
If Chairs had but speech it would whisper alarms
To him who's next cl in its stuffy old arms.
How long there I languished, and lolled in despair-
Till I wished myself wood like the rest of “the Chair!”
A decade and more since I first filled the place!"
There's many a form and there’s many a face
Have vanished since I donned the wig of grey hair,
And sat and looked stately, at ease in that Chair.
Men say I have honoured that Chair ever since,
With #. poise of a judge and the mien of a prince.
Perhaps! " But I’m weary, and glad, I declare,
To make now a change to my own Easy Chair.
When the candles burn low, and the company's gone,
In the silence of night I shall sit here alone,
Or with you, Mr. Punch, many-memoried pair,
And muse on old days in that high Speaker's Chair!
Eh? What, Mr. Punch 2 Read me last night's debate P
Oho! Order! Order!! I’m drowsy, 'tis late.
For Ayes and for Noes, Punch, no more need I care;

LETTERS FROM THE SHADES.
HAVE just perused report of Commission on Library Wall-flowers.
Appears that enterprising book-shop, resort of fashionable world for
ast century, has sent round urgent whip to Representative Men of
etters (and also Mr. LE GALLIENNE) asking for short list of best
neglected books. Find that answers cover fairly wide ground, from
HomeR to New English Dictionary. Feeling that it might please
#. public to have some expression of opinion from various
efunct authors described with faint praise as undeservedly
neglected, and finding it inconvenient to arrange personal interview,
by reason of distance and other difficulties, have sent out circular
requesting that they would interview themselves on the subject and
indly let me have result. Some answered evasively, through
secretaries. Subjoin small assortment from letters of those who
responded frankly:-
HoMER obligEs with A FEw HEXAMETERs.
Lo! in the hollows of Hades I hear the lamenting of LUBBock,
Bart., who declares that HoMERUs (or somebody else of the same
name,
Qne or the other, or both, or perhaps a collection of poets)—
LUbbock, I say, who declares that the sale of my poems is paltry,
Says he is sorry to see me reduced to the state of a wall-flower
But as a matter of fact I have got an immense circulation,
Chiefly in Oxford and Cambridge and Eton and other palaestrae.
SoPHocLEs pushes me close, but PINDAR is out of the running,
Being a bit too liff, though the cost is defrayed by the parents.
As for the rest, I consider HERoporus very łºś.
Quaintly enough at this moment I see he is writing about me,
Writing to say he considers HomeRUs exceedingly clever.
Who, by the way, is a Mr. LEGALLIENNE * He, as they tell me,
Prattles a lot on his private affairs for the good of the public.
HERODoTUs Forwards A TRIFLING BROCHURE.
To me for my part it appears that of the other poets, both those
before and after, no one, as the saying is, can hold a two-penny
torch to HomEBUs. He, in the language of the Far-Western people,
whips cosmos. But of those that write things not to be men-
tioned, no Then Man dwelling in the nether world can surpass the
Now Woman. So at least they that are over the book-market tell
me; but them I cannot easily believe. Further, to speak of such as
collect history, but, being unworthy indeed of neglect do yet esca
the notice of those that appoint to office, I give the front row to Mr.
ShakspeaRE sends AN occASIONAL SoNNET.
Had I survived my well-contented age.
And lived to see the bettering of the times,
And witnessed HENRY ARTHUR on the stage,
Or read the latest confidential rhymes;
Small marvel were it that my tragic art
Should lapse among a race of larger build;
Or that the sonnet-echoes of my heart -
Should fail before the booming Bodley guild.
Yet have I lovers still, a faithful few ;
And here I take occasion for observing
How greatly I have been indebted to
The Cambridge Locals and to Mr. IRVINg.
Post-script.—The Temple SHAKSPEARE for the pocket
Is selling now; I know of none to knock it.
LoRD VERULAM KINDLY QUOTES HIMSELF.
You shall not ask better from me than that I should distil you
these two extracts from my Standard Essays, amended to date.
1. Of Studies.—Reading, and namely of the kitchen ware of
AUTolycus, maketh a full man; reviewing maketh a puffy man; and
my New Organ, now old and strangely unpopular, maketh an har-
monious man. -
2. Of Gardens.—Very delightful for sweetness is the Wall-
flower; likewise the Bonny Briar-Patch, But of those flowers such
as the Aster and the Carnation, of which the perfume is such, that
they are best trodden upon and bruised, there is yet another that you
shall take heed of. It is the Sweet Earl Lavender. You shall pass
by a whole alley of them and find nothing of their sweetness: they
are like precocious odours, most desirable when incensed or crushed.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday Night, March 11.-A great cloud
fallen over House to-day. Soon the stately presence that fills the
Chair will step forth, never to return. The sonorous voice that can
still the storm in its angriest mood will no more resound through the
hushed Chamber. The best Speaker the House of Commons in its long
history has known, will be *†, in the mediocrity of the House
of Lords. A hard succession of blows to fall on an assembly. First
Mr. G., then GRANDolph, and now ARTHUR PREL, three men of
ºy varied type, each unique, in his way reaching the highest
evel.
Suppose we shall get along somehow, though for all concerned in
business of House, in maintaining its usefulness and supporting its
dignity, the future without PEEL in the Chair not to be regarded
without foreboding. He has every quality and gift that go to make
the ideal Speaker. A noble presence, a fine voice, a courtly manner,
a resolute will, a full knowledge of the forms of the House, a keen
though decently suppressed sense of humour—a scholar and a gentle-
man. These things are seen and recognised from outside. Only
those who live and work in the House of Commons know how mar-
vellous is the combination, how infinite in its magnitude the loss
impending.
Tuesday.—Talk to-night all about successor to the SPEAKER. A
dozen names mentioned; general, conclusion that whoever may be
selected, he’s not to be envied. . The Member for SARK, turning up
to-night for first time this Session, brings strange news. Has been
on the Riviera, daily expecting influenza. , Saw Mr. G. yesterday;
the talk at Cap Martin, as here, all about the soon-to-be emptied
Chair, and who is to fill it. SARK tells me he is quite certain
Mr. G. is thinking of coming forward as candidate; is (so SARK
says, and he is a most reliable person) evidently eating out his heart
in voluntary retirement. Now he's got his Psalter out, doesn't know
what to do next.
“I asked him,” SARK says, “whether there was any precedent for
an ex-Prime Minister, however young in years and untamed in
energy, becoming Speaker.”

[They do so, with a general sigh of relief.
“Not exactly,” he said; “but there is the case of a Speaker who

became Prime Minister. ADDINGTON, you will remember, Speaker in
1789, was Premier at the turn of the century. It was said of him by
the way, that he never quite overcame the force of old habits. When
#. with the Cabinet in consideration of foreign affairs he had
difficulty in refraining from saying “The French to the right, the
Austrians to the left.” . Don't see why the case shouldn't be
taken the other way about, and an ex-Premier become Speaker.
Fancy I may take it that I have some qualifications for the post.
Know the House pretty intimately; have been familiar with it for
some years. Am told I neverlooked so picturesque as when, on public
occasions, I wore official gown of Chancellor of Exchequer. Think
the Speaker's dress would suit me. But that a mere trifle. What I
hanker after, at my time of life, at the close of a career not abso-
lutely free from hard work, is some post not too arduous. Seems to
me the Speakership would be the very thing; just enough to do, and
not too much.”
~~

A
Mr. G. (disguised in Speaker's wig and gown). “Rather fancy the
costume would suit me down to the ground !”
If it had been anyone but SARK had said this, would have listened
with incredulity. But SARK most respectable man.
Business done.—Robertson in excellent speech explained Navy
Estimates.
Thursday.—The Silence of SILoMIo. No, it’s not the title of a
novel. You're thinking of the late Dean MAITLAND. This quite
another story; equally tragic. Came about this way. House met
to deal with Army Estimates. CAwMEL-BANNERMAN in his place,
after ten days in his bedroom with a cold. The cold must have had
most amusing companion, that is if CAwMEL was as pawky with it
as he was to-night with the semi-military horde led by Private
HANBURY, who swooped down and barred approach to Committee.
These deployed in the open; placed their amendments on the paper.
House knew what to expect. Never suspected SILoMIo in ambush.
As soon as questions over, plot disclosed. CochRANE, a harmless,
erhaps necessary, man, put up to move. adjournment, in order tº
iscuss the Swazi question. That in itself a stroke of genius. Had
Silo Mio personally moved, game would have seemed too stale.
Probability is forty Members not been found to stand up in support
of motion. Looks much better to have such action taken on one side
of Honse and supported from the other; invests it with air of im-
partiality and unanimity. On challenge from the SPEAKER, Con-
servatives rose in body to support Coch RANE's request. Having
secured that object, and being on their legs, they strolled out, leaving
Squirr of MALwood, SYDNEY BUxton, and about a score of others
all told, to listen to CochRANE's urgent message. Amongst them sat
FRANK Lockwood, with tender gleam in eyes that roamed with
curious intentness about Speaker's chair.
Whilst Coch RANE spoke, SILoMIo sat with inspired look on his
face, making voluminous notes. He would come on by-and-by.
hapless Ministers thought it was over, and they might get to busi-
ness, they should hear a well-known ... should discover
SILoMIo at the table, in for a good hour's speech. Meanwhile he
“Our Artist”—Sir Frank Blockwood, Q.C., M.P.
sat piling notes upon notes, pausing occasionally to cheer CochRANE,
anon humming softly to himself -
“Swaziland, my Swaziland!”
UNDER SECRETARY FOR ColonDEs deprecated in public interest
irregular discussion of question at present time. Gobst, hampered
by this responsibility, made curiously halting speech. BADEN-
Powell spoke “as one who had been in South Africa”; SQUIRE of
MALwood more gravely repeated SYDNEY BUxton's warning. Now
was SILoMio's time. But hefore he could move PRINCE ARTHUR was
on his feet, positively, with some commonplaces about respecting
Ministerial responsibility, consenting to close the conversation!
SILoMio gasped for breath; instinctively felt for his assegai;
clutched at his notes dripping with the gore of SYDNEY BUxTon.
When he had partially mastered his emotion the amendment was
withdrawn and opportunity had fled.
“Sic cos non robis pellera fertis oves,” said PLUNKET soothingly.
“But never mind. You remember that in the end VIRGIL got his
own, and BATHYLLUs was basted.” SILoMIo stared.
Business done.—SILoMIo contrives a debate and others talk.
Friday Night.—Policemen in lobby much startled by incident that
preceded arrival of SPEAKER to resume sittings at nine o'clock. The
steady tramp of a column in .# order broke on the ear. Came
nearer and nearer from direction of dining-room; swinging doors
flung open; Colonel of the Queen's Westminster Volunteers entered.
Behind him, in close order, tramped something like score of members.
At word of command they took half turn to right and passed into
House, as in earlier days another British column swung through the
gates of Delhi.
Ten minutes later, more than half the force were observed to come
ont of the House, look furtively round, and dash off in various direc-
tions, some to smoking-room, some to reading-room, and some clear
off the premis's. But they had done, their appointed work, and
HowARD VINCENT, an old campaigner, had secured opportunity for
delivering his speech on hostile tariffs and bounties.
Grave doubt at morning sitting whether House could be made for
the alluring joy. VINCENT took up position in lobby much as
recruiting-sergeant shows himself near Trafalgar Square. Accosted
all Members passing by. Offered them free rations and front seats
for the lecture if they would stay. Soon picked up enough men to
reduce chances of count out. Dinner, I am told, a little exciting.
especially towards the end. Several Members discovered straying
towards the door. But the ex-captain of the Royal Berks Militia
not to be trifled with. Kept them together past the cheese; de-
livered every man in the House one minute and thirty seconds
before the SPEAKER took the Chair. If any skulked out when the
Colonel was once embarked on his lecture he, of course, couldn't inter-
fere. But they mustn't suppose their departure wasn't marked. No
more free rations for them.
Business done.—By reason of CAwMFLL-BANNERMAN's great per-
suasiveness men and money for Army voted at morning sitting.

No. IX. —Awkward Position of HIPPolicEMAN AMONG THE wild BULLS AND BEARs IN THROGMoRTON STREET.
(Wide Papers, March 22.)
AN ELECTION ADDRESS.
[Mr. RIDER HAGGARD has become the accepted Conservative candidate
for a Norfolk constituency. The following is understood to be an advance
copy of his Address.]
INTELLIGENT electors, may Iventure to present
Myself as an aspirant for a seat in Parliament?
The views of those opponents who despise a novelist,
Are but the foggy arguments of People of the Mist!
No writer, I assure you, can produce a better claim,
A greater versatility, a more substantial fame;
My candidature, though opposed by all the yellow gang,
Has won the hearty sympathy of Mr. ANDREw LANg.
And if what my opinions are you’d really like to know,
They’re issued at a modest price by Long MANs, GREEN, & Co.;
The Eight Hours Bill, for instance, I'm prepared to speak upon
From a practical acquaintance with the Mines of Solomon.
Whatever my intentions as to Woman's Rights may be,
I yield to none in honouring the great immortal She ;
While, as to foreign policy, though Blue Books make you yawn,
You’il find the su ject treated most attractively in Dawn.
When I am placed in Parliament, I’ll speak with fluent skill,
And show (like Mr. MEEson) I’ve a most effective will;
And if there is a special point for which I mean to fight,
It is for legislation to protect my copyright.
If chance debate to matters in South Africa should tend,
My anecdotes will cause the Speaker's wig to stand on end;
And if an opportunity occurs, I’ll rouse the lot
By perorating finely in impassioned Hottentot!
So, Gentlemen, I beg you, let my arguments prevail,
Shame would it be if such a cause through apathy should fail,
Shame on the false elector who his honest duty shirks!

“WBEN ARTHUR FIRST AT COURT.”
LAST, week, the Court Theatre was advertised as a “Company,
Limited.” The cast in the bill was given as Chairman, ARTHUR
W. PINERo: First Director, Sir ARTHUR SULLIVAN (with a song P);
Second Director, HERBERT BENNETT (Director also of HARRod's
Stores, Limited, the success of which establishment has been so great
as to now out-HARRoD HARROD); and then ARTHUR CHUDLEIGH
(who was jointly lessee at one time with Mrs. John Wood), as
Director and Acting Manager. The Solicitor is down as ARTHUR
B. CHUBB (“little fish are sweet”), and the Secretary is Mr. A.
º ARTHURP) S. DUNN. Most appropriate this name to
ish with ; “and now my, story's DUNN.” Fortunate omen,
too, that there are two “n's" in DUNN, which otherwise is a word
associated with a Court not quite so cheerful as the Court Theatre.
But the curious note about it is the preponderance of “ARTHURs.”
ARTHUR PINERO, ARTHUR SULLIVAN, ARTHUR CHUDLEIGH, ARTHUR
Chubb, and *...". DUNN. If they have power to add to their
number, why not e in ARTHUR Jon Es, ARTHUR LLoyd, and
Arthur Rogers? That would make the Dramatic Arthurs and
the Musical ARTHURs about equal.
MATILDA CHARLoTTE Wood is mentioned as having had an agree-
ment with one of the ARTHURs yelept CHUDLEIGH, and probably
also a disagreement too, as their once highly prosperous joint
management came to an end. But now “she will return,” at least,
everyone hopes so, as, after her capital performance of the §
i. at Drury Lane, she has shown us that she is as fresh an
as great an attraction as ever. Some of the ARTHURs will write for
her, one ARTHUR will compose for her, two ARTHURs will act and
sing with her, and ARTHUR, the managing director, will direct and
manage her. May every success, attend the venturel But how
about authors and composers offering their work to so professional
a board of directors? Doesn't Sir Fretful P ry's objection to
sending his play in to the manager of Drury e, namely, that
“he writes himself.” hold good nowadays? Hum. A difficulty,
most decidedly; still, not absolutely insuperable.
Which Settles It.

MR, PINERO's new play at the Garrick Theatre is a series of scenes s it is the audience wearies of the long speeches, and there is
in dialogue with only one “situation,” which comes at the end of the nothing in the action that can rouse them as there was in The Second
Mrs. Tanqueray, a play that Mr. PINERo has not yet
ualled, much less surpassed. -
ut what is a real pleasure, and what will attract all
lovers of good, acting, is, first of all, Mr. Fobbes Robert-
son's admirable impersonation of the difficult, unsympa-
thetic rôle of a despicably selfish, self-conceited, cowardly
prig ; and, secondly, to a certain extent, the .."; of
the heroine by Mrs. PATRICK CAMPBELL, who, however, does
not come within measurable distance of her former self as
Mrs. Tanqueray—her “great stove scene” being about the
weakest point in her performance. But there cannot be a
divided opinion as to the º. given to Mr. John
HARE a. as to the absolutely perfect manner in which it is
played by this consummate artistin character. All the scenes
in which he *}. are admirably conceived by the author,
and as admirably interpreted by the actor. -
Mr. HARE's performance of the Duke of St. Qlpherts is a
real gem, ranking among the very best things he has ever
done, and I may even add “going one better.” It is on his
acting, and on the acting of the scenes in which he appears,
that the ultimate popularity of the piece must depend. The
theatrical stove-cum-book situation may tell with some
audiences better than with others, but it is not an absolute
certainty; while every scene in which the Duke of St.
Qlpherts takes part, as long, as this character is played by
Mr. HARE, is in itself an absolute isolated triumph. Mr.
AUBREY SMITH, as the modern * English moustached
rson, en voyage, with his pipe, and bible in his pocket (is

of her lover, who is a married man,—“which well she knows it,” as
Mrs. GAMP observes, but with whom she is living, and with whom,
like GRANT ALLEN's The Woman who did (a lady whom in many
respects Mr. PINERQ's heroine closely resembles), and who came to
grief in doing it, she intends to continue living. This man, her
paramour, she trusts will be her partner in the socialistic regenera-
tion of the human race. At the close of the third act Mrs. Ebb-
smith, being such as the author of her being has made her, is
presented, with a bible, and, in a fit of ungovernable fury, she
pitches it into the stove “with all her might and main”; and then
it. suddenly occurs, to her that she has committed some terrible
crime, (more º it occurred to the author that he had com-
mitted the unpardonable sin of offending his audience)—and so she

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE GAME OF DRAUGHTS.
(By One who has Played it.)
AssumE that I am living in Yokohama
Gardens (before the pleasant change from
winter to spring), and that I am conscious of
the near approach of the North Pole. The fires
in the grates seem to be lukewarm, and even
the s are frozen. My servants have told
me that the milk had to be melted before it
could adorn the breakfast-table; and as for
the butter, it is as hard as marble. There is
only one thing to do, to send for that worthy
creature Mr. LoPSIDE, an individual “who
can turn his hand to anything.”
“Well Sir,” Mr. LopsIDE arrives and ob-
serves after a few moments spent in careful
consideration of, the subject from various
É. of view, “of course you feel the cold
- use there is five-and-twenty degrees of
frost just outside.”
I admit that Mr. Lopsipk's opinionis reason-
able; and call his attention to the fact that a
newspaper which is lying on the floor some five
yards from a closed door is violently agitated.
| “... I see Sir,” says he promptly. “If you
will wait a moment I will tell you more
about it.”
He takes off his coat, throws down a bag
of tools (his chronic companion), and lies flat
on the floor. Then he places his right ear to
ºf...; and listens intently, pointing the
while to the newspaper that has now ceased
to suffer from agitation.
“There you are, Sir l’” he exclaims
triumphantly. ...“There's a draught there.
I could feel it distinctly.”
He rises from the ground, reassumes his
overcoat, and once more possesses himself of
his bag of useful instruments.
“Well, what shall I do?” I ask.
“Well, you see Sir, it's not for the likes of
me to advise gentry folk like you. Twouldn't
think of presuming upon such a liberty.”
“Not at all, Mr. Lopside,” I explain with
some anxiety. - - - -
“Then Sir-mind you, if it's not taking
too much of a liberty—I would, having
draughts, get rid of them. And you have
draughts about, now haven't you?”
I hasten to assure him that I am convined
that my house is a perfect nest of draughts.
“Don’t you be too sure until I have tested
them,” advises Mr. LopsIDE.
Then the ingenious creature again divests
himself of his overcoat and workman's bag
and commences his labours. He visits every
door in the house and tries it. He assumes
all sorts of attitudes. Now he appears like
JºssIE BRown at Lucknow listening to the
distant slogan of the coming Highlanders.
Now like a colleague of GUY FAwkes noting
the tread of Lord MonTEAGLE on the road to
the gunpowder cellar beneath the Houses of
Parliament. His attitudes, if not exactly
graceful, are full of character.
“There are draughts everywhere,” says
Mr. LoPsi DE, having come to the end of his
investigations.
“And what shall I do?” I ask for the
second time. Again my worthy inspector
spends a few minutes in self-communing.
“It's not for the likes of a poor man like
me, Sir, to give advice; but if I were you,
Sir I would say antiplutocratic tubing.”
“What is antiplutocratic tubing?”
“Well, Sir, it’s as good a thing as you
can have, under all the circumstances. But
don't have antiplutocratic tubing because I
say, º, I may be wrong, Sir.”
‘No, no, Mr. LoPsipe,” I reply, in a tone
of encouragement. “I am sure you are right.
Do you think you could get me some anti-
plutocratic tubing, and put it up for me?”
SO LIKELY!

my worthy helper, in the tone of a more than
usually benevolent Father Christmas. Then
he seems to lose heart and become despondent.
“But there, Sir, it’s not for the likes of me to
say anything.”
owever, I persuade Mr. LoPsi DE to take
a more chee view of his position, and to
undertake the job.
For the next three hours there is much
hammering in all parts of the house. My
neighbours must imagine that. I have
taken violently to spiritual manifestations.
Wherever I wander Ifind my ...} assistant
hard at work covering the borders of the doors
with a material that looks like elongated eels
in a condition of mummification—if I may
be permitted to use such an expression. Now
he is standing on a ledge level with the hall
lamp; now he is reclining sideways beside
an entrance-protecting rug; now he is hang-
ing by the bannisters midway between two
landings. The day grows apace. It is soon
afternoon, and rapidly becomes night. When
the lights are º: to appear in the
streets without, Mr. Lopside has done. My
house is rescued from the draughts.
“You won't be troubled much more, Sir,”
door embedded in antiplutocratic tubing.
“Keep those shut and the º: won't get
near you—at least so I think, although I may
be wrong. Thank you, Sir. Quite correct.
Good evening.”
And he leaves me, muffled upin hisovercoat,
and still clinging to his basket, with its
burden of saws, hammers, chisels, and nails
of various dimensions iſ enter the dining-
room with an air of satisfaction as I hear his
echoing footsteps on the pavement without,
and attempt to close the door. It will do
almost everything, but it wont shut. I give
up the dining-room, and enter my study,
Again, I try to close the door. But no; it
has caught the infection of its neighbour and
also declines to close. I try the doors of the
drawilg-room, m, and the dressing-
room. But no, my efforts are in vain. None
of them will close. The wind howls, and the
draughts rush in with redoubled fury. They
triumph meanly in my despair.
There is only one thing to do, and I deter-
mine to do it. I must send for Mr. Lopside
to take away as soon as possible his anti-
plutocratic tubing. . After all, he was right
when he had those, alas! unheeded misgivings.

“Why, of course I could, Sir!” returns

as to the fate of this risky situation—this “momentum unde pendet'
-and for which nothing, either in the character or in the previous
history of the heroine, has prepared us. Her earliest years have
been passed in squalor; she has made a miserable marriage; then she
has become a Socialist ranter, and * to achieve a triumph as a
Socialist demagogue. Like Maypole Hugh in Barnaby Rudge she
would go about the world shrieking “No property! No property!”
and when, in a weak moment, she consents to º: p her
“mission,” she goes to another extreme and comes out in an evening
dress-I might say almost comes out of an evening dress, so egregi-
ously décolleté is it—to please the peculiar and, apparently, low taste
of her lover, who is a married man,—“which well she knows it,” as
Mrs. GAMP observes, but with whom she is living, and with whom,
like GRANT ALLEN's The Woman who did (a lady whom in many
respects Mr. PINERQ's heroine closely resembles), and who came to
grief in doing it, she intends to continue living. This man, her
paramour, she trusts will be her partner in the socialistic regenera-
tion of the human race. At the close of the third act Mrs. Ebb-
smith, being, such, as the author of her being has made her, is
presented with a bible, and, in a fit of ungovernable fury, she
pitches it into the stove “with all her might and main”; and then
it. suddenly occurs to her that she has committed some terrible
crime, (more probably, it occurred to the author, that he had com-
mitted the unpardonable sin of offending his audience)—and so she
shoots out her arm into a nice, cool-looking stove (suggestive of
no sort of danger to her or the book), and drags out the pocket volume
#. quite, as j. as is her own hand at the moment,
ough this is subsequently carefully bound up with a white hand-
kerchief in the last act. Well—that's all. ere is the situation.
The Key-note-orious Mrs. Ebbsmith is supposed to repent of her
sins against society; and off she goes to become the companion of the
unmarried parson and of the lively widow his sister. hat the re-
sult of this arrangement will be is pretty clear. The Key-note-orious
One will soon be the parson's bride; but “that is another story.”
To carry out this drama of inaction, as it is schemed, should occupy
eight persons something under two hours; but it takes per-
sons three hours to carry it along. Five of these dramatis personae
are superfluous; and much timeiswasted on dialoguesin that could be “faked up” from any conversation-book Mrs. Tanqueray, a play that Mr. PINERo has not yet
equalled, much less surpassed. -
But what is a real pleasure, and what will attract all
lovers of good, acting, is, first of all, Mr. Forbes Robert-
son's admirable impersonation, of the difficult, unsympa-
thetic rôle of a despicably selfish, self-conceited, cowardly
prig ; and, secondly, to a certain extent, the rendering of
the heroine by Mrs. PATRICK CAMPBELL, who, however, does
not come within measurable distance of her former self as
Mrs. Tanqueray—her “great stove scene” being about the
weakest point in her performance. But there cannot be a
divided opinion as to the E. given to Mr. John
HARE a. as to the absolutely perfect manner in which it is
played by this consummate artistin character. All the scenes
in which he *::::: are admirably conceived by the author,
and as admirably interpreted by the actor. -
Mr. HARE's performance of the Duke of St. Qlpherts is a
real gem, ranking among the very best things he has ever
done, and I may even add “going one better.” It is on his
acting, and on the acting of the scenes in which he appears,
that the ultimate popularity of the piece must depend. The
theatrical stove-cum-book situation may tell with some
audiences better than with others, but it is not an absolute
certainty; while every scene in which the Duke of St.
Qlpherts takes part, as long, as this character is played by
Mr. HARE, is in itself an absolute isolated triumph. Mr.
AUBREY SMITH, as the modern yº moustached
rson, en voyage, with his pipe, and bible in his pocket (is
e a colporteur of some #."Society, with a percentage on
the sale? otherwise, the book is an awkward size to carry
about, especially if he has also a Murray with him), is ve
true to life, at all eyents in manner and appearance; an
Miss JEFFREys, as his sister, who looks just as if she had
º * walked out of a fashion-plate in The Gentlewoman, or some
* lady's journal, plays discreetly and with considerable self-
repression. Of course it will remain one of the notable pieces
of the year; but what will keep it green in the memory of
playgoers is not the story, nor its heroine, nor its hero, but the capti-
vating impersonation of the Duke of St. Olpherts by Mr. John HARE.

THE GAME OF DRAUGHTS.
(By One who has Played it.)
ASSUME_that I am living in Yokohama
Gardens (before the pleasant change from
winter to spring), and that I am conscious of
the near approach of the North Pole. The fires
in the grates seem to be lukewarm, and even
the s are frozen. My servants have told
me that the milk had to be melted before it
could adorn the breakfast-table; and as for
the butter, it is as hard as marble. There is
only one thing to do, to send for that worthy
creature Mr. LoPsi DE, an individual “who
can turn his hand to anything.”
“Well Sir,” Mr. LopsIDE arrives and ob-
serves after a few moments spent in careful
consideration of the subject from yarious
ints of view, “of course you feel the cold
: use there is five-and-twenty degrees of
frost just outside.”
| I admit that Mr. LoPsipk's opinion is reason-
able; and call his attention to the fact that a
newspaper which is lying on the floor some five
yards from a closed door is violently agitated.
“I see Sir,” says he promptly. “If you
will wait a moment I will tell you more
about it.”
He takes off his coat, throws down, a bag
of tools (his chronic companion), and lies flat
on the floor. Then he places his right ear to
"...; and listens intently, pointing the
while to the newspaper that has now ceased
to suffer from agitation.
“There you are, Sir l’” he exclaims
triumphantly. ...“There's a draught there.
I could feel it distinctly.”
He rises from the ground, reassumes his
overcoat, and once more possesses himself of
his bag of useful instruments.
“Well, what shall I do?” I ask,
“Well, you see Sir, it's not for the likes of
meto advise gentry folk like you. I wouldn't
think of presuming upon such a liberty.”
“Not at all, Mr. LopsIDE,” I explain with
some anxiety.
“Then Sir-mind you, if it’s not taking
too much of a liberty—I would, having
draughts, get rid of them. And you have
draughts about, now haven't you?”
I hasten to assure him that I am convined
that my house is a perfect nest of draughts.
“Don’t you be too sure until I have tested
them,” advises Mr. LopsIDE.
Then the ingenious creature again divests
himself of his overcoat and workman's bag
and commences his labours. He visits every
door in the house and tries it. He assumes
all sorts of attitudes. . Now he appears like
JEssie BRown at Lucknow listening to the
distant slogan of the coming Highlanders.
Now like a colleague of GUY FAwkes noting
the tread of Lord MontFAGLE on the road to
the gunpowder cellar beneath the Houses of
Parliament. His attitudes, if not exactly
graceful, are full of character.
“There are draughts everywhere,” says
Mr. LoPSIDE, having come to the end of his
investigations.
“And what shall I do?” I ask for the
second time. Again my worthy inspector
spends a few minutes in self-communing.
“It’s not for the likes of a poor man like
me, Sir, to give advice; but if I were you,
Sir, I would say antiplutocratic tubing.”
... What is antiplutocratic tubing?”
“Well, Sir, it's as good a thing as you
can have, under all the circumstances. But
don't have antiplutocratic tubing because I
say, 59. I may be wrong, Sir.”
‘No, no, Mr. LoPsi DE,” I reply, in a tone
of encouragement. “I am sure you are right.
Do you think you could get me some anti-
plutocratic tubing, and put it up for me?”

my worthy helper, in the tone of a more than
usually benevolent Father Christmas. Then
he seems to lose heart and become despondent.
“But there, Sir, it’s not for the likes of me to
say anything.”
owever, I persuade Mr. LoPSIDE to take
a more chee view of his position, and to
undertake the job.
For the next three hours there is much
hammering in all parts of the house. My
neighbours must imagine that, I have
taken violently to spiritual manifestations.
Wherever I wander Ifind my worthy assistant
hard at work covering the borders of the doors
with a material that looks like elongated eels
in a condition of mummification—if I may
be permitted to use such an expression. Now
he is standing on a ledge level with the hall
lamp; now he is reclining sideways beside
an entrance-protecting rug; now he is hang-
ing by the bannisters midway between two
landings. The day grows apace. It is soon
afternoon, and rapidly becomes night. When
the lights are º: to appear in the
streets without . Lops/DE has done. My
house is rescued from the draughts.
“You won't be troubled much more, Sir,”
door embedded in antiplutocratic tubing.
“Keep those shut and the º: won't get
near you—at least so I think, although I may
be wrong. Thank you, Sir. Quite correct.
Good evening.”
Andheleaves me, muffledupin hisovercoat,
and still clinging to his basket, with its
burden of saws, hammers, chisels, and nails
of various dimensions iſ enter the dining-
room with an air of satisfaction as I hear his
echoing footsteps, on the pavement without,
and attempt to close the door. It will do
almost everything, but it wont shut. I give
up the dining-room, and enter my study.
Again, I try to close the door. But no; it
has caught the infection of its neighbour and
also declines to close. I try the doors of the
drawing-room, m, and the dressing-
room. But no, my efforts are in vain. None
of them will close. The wind howls, and the
draughts rush in with redoubled fury. They
triumph meanly in my despair.
There is only one thing to do, and I deter-
mine to do it. I must send for Mr. LoPsi DF
to take away as soon as possible his anti-
plutocratic tubing. . After all, he was right
when he had those, alas! unheeded misgivings.













“Why, of course I could, Sir!” returns
He said “he might be wrong"—and was 1

For “immediate payment” is—well, it's astounding.
How will the water come down through the floor
When mains are unfrozen and pipes are all “busting”?
Why spurting and squirting, with rush and with roar,.

And rushing, and gushing, and flashing and ºplashing,
And making a sort of Aix douche of the bedroom,
And comfort destroying, and every hope dashing,
And leaving one scarce a square yard of dry head-room.

Will make of my dwelling, from garret to basement,
Well, that's after thaw. But, by Jove, it does tickle

THE WOMAN WHO WOULDN'T DO.
(She-Note Series.)
THE two were seated in an untrammelled Bohemian sort of way on
the imperturbable expanse of the South Downs. Beneath them was
8. tof sheep-sorrel, its orbicular perianth being slightly depressed
by their healthy weight. In the distance they noticed thankfully
the saucer-shaped combes of paludina limestone rising in pleasant
strata to the rearin
scarp of the Weald.
PERUGINo ALLAN
was the gentleman's
name. He had only
met PseudoNYMIA

munity of literary

“PSEUDONYMIA!”
said PERUGINo,

his finger-tips.

for Christian names,
but then the Terewth
had made them.Free-

straight on, please, es at a time. Never mind about Probability.
Terewth is stranger than Probability; and the Terewth, you know,
shall make you Free!” - -
PERUGINo sank back into the º turf, leaning his cheek
against an upright spike of summer furze of the genus Uler
uropaeus. º Some men,” he began, “ignoble souls, ‘look about'
them before they marry. Such are calculating egoists. Pure souls
of finer paste, are, so to k, born married. Others hesitate and
delay. The difficulties of teething, a paltry desire to be weaned
before the wedding, reluctance to being married in long clothes, the
terrors of croup during the honeymoon—these and other excuses,
thinly veiling hidden depths of depravity, are employed to defer the
divine moment. I have known men to reach the preposterously ripe
age of one-and-twenty unwedded, protesting that they dare not risk
their prospects at the Bar. These men can never mate like the
birds, never be guide-posts to point humanity along the path of
Terewth.” - - -
“But,” interrupted Pseudonym IA, rose-red to her quiverin
finger-tips with shame at the bare mention of marriage; “but
thought you disapproved of the debasing principle of wedlock.”
“Do not interrupt,” said PERUGINo, kindly; “I will come to that
two or three pages later on. To be prudent, I was going to say, is
to be vicious and cruel. Of course it is not given to all to be born
married. ... But this natal defect one can easily remedy. I knew a
3. fellow who did. The indispensable complement crossed his

married the matron. True, there was disparity of age, but it was
a step in the right direction; though the head master, a man of
common conventional ideas, gave the boy a severe rebuke. -

elsewhere, is a degrading system, nurtured under the purple .

burnt Siena. What a wonderful Peruguinesque chapter that was in
your book, Like a leaf torn out of the live heart of BAEDEKER!”
“Italy,” continued PERUGINo doggedly, “is the home of back-
more pasts the better. Is not that a beautiful thought? Ever
moving on to something different!”
“That has been the dream of my childhood,” said PseudonyMIA,
her white Cordelia-like soul thrilled through and through with
sacred convictions. A ripe gorse-pod burst in the basking sunlight.
(“I never remember seeing sunlight bask before,” she thought.) A
bumble-bee said something inaudible. “But why,” she added,
“ did you never give this pure sentiment to the world' before? You !
who have written so many many books?”
-4 child,” replied the artist, “I was compelled to write down to
the public taste. One must consider one's prospects. This, you will
say, seems to clash with what I said before about calculating egoists.
But profession and practice are ever divorced under our depraved
system of civilisation. At last, having established myself, "I rose
superior to sordid avarice, and wrote for once solely to satisfy my own
taste and conscience.”
“A noble sacrifice!” said PSEUDoNYMIA, suppressing her dimples
for the moment. “As the physically weaker’vessel. I could only
have done it under an assumed name. But tell me of one difficulty
which you have so cleverly avoided in your book. This question of
the family. Will not a confusion arise in another generation when
nobody quite knows who and how many his or her half-brothers and
half-sisters are?”
“PseudonyMIA!” said PERUGINo, and his voice broke in two
places, “I am pained... I had thought that you, so pure, so
emancipate, would have had a soul above blithering detail. Besides,
do you not see that in this way the whole world will eventually |

time to her finger-tips, “must it ever be so? Profession, as you say,

“WHAT so interests you?” asked the visitor. Replied the Baron,
“Japhet in. Search of a Father: , I have not read it, since my
school days.” “You find it old-fashioned, eh?” “Well,” answered
the Baron, “the first few chapters are certainly old-fashioned, and

Hook and of Tom and Jerry. But Captain MARRYAT soon gets
away from this sort of thing; and when he has once fairly started
his hero and his companion on their adventures, the interest of
the story is never allowed to flag for a minute. I may add that I have
not enjoyed any modern story of adventure so much as I have this
on ways barring the romances of RIDER HAGGARD, STEPHENson,
‘Q.,’ SHORTHouse, and PARKER—as there is about it an old
Georgian-era flavour, with its duels, its gambling-houses, its Tom-
and-Jerry episodes, its occasional drop into melodrama, its varied
characters of the period, its animal spirits and ‘go,' that makes it
—to me, at least—thoroughly fascinating.” The illustrations, by
H. M. BRock—which are specified as separately the property of
Messrs. MACMILLAN-bring vividly before the reader th. Inanners
and customs of the time. “In these days of morbid yellow-jaun-
diced sensationalism, and of “The New Woman,” I am delighted,”
quoth the Baron, “to recommend, and strongly, too, this first of the
series of Captain MARRYAT's works, now in course of republication
chez MACMILLAN.” The visitor thanked his noble friend, and
withdrew. Then the Baron finished the novel. “Good!” quoth
the Baron, closing the book with regret at parting with a long-
forgotten but now recovered friend; “but 'tis odd how one lives and
learns. I do not remember having ever heard that Bottom the
weaver had been christened ‘WILLIAM” by ShakspeaRE. Nor can
I find that bully Bottom was so addressed by his friends. And if I
have missed it, how came WILLIAM to be the prénom of the Athenian
weaver in the time of Theseus and Hippolyta / I should as soon
expect to discover that Hercules was known to his companions as
I anticipate with pleasure re-making the acquaintance of Jacob

The Banishment of Jessop Blythe, written by Joseph HaTron,
and published by Hutchinson, belongs to the Kellow. Book series,
only that is as far as the cover is concerned, which is of a startlingly
jaundiced tone and does not in the least represent the kindly author's
views of life. The story is about the ropemakers by one who clearly
“knows the ropes.” This industry, as will be gathered from the
present romance, is not confined to Ropemaker's Walk, E.C., but
was for two centuries carried on by ...i odytes or Cave-dwellers in
Derbyshire. The hero Blythe is turned out from the roping com-
munity as a thriftless drunkard, emigrates, is poor and wretched, but
returns Blythe and gay, with a lot of money to find..... “But

a spark to let slip the dogs of war.”

grew as MELLOR,
failing to see him,

speakers. The MAC-
GREGoR knew all
about that; a reck-
less corrupt Govern-
ment, afraid of
hearing the voice of
honest criticism, had
suborned Chairman
of Committees to
prevent his speak-
ing. But they didn't
know the MAC-
GREgor. After
something like two
hours physical exer-
ºise in the way of
jumping up and
down he caught the
Chairman's eye, and
(in Parliamentary
sense, of course)
unched it. Then
- - - ‘passing from point
to point,” as he airily put it, he went for Robertson. Asked the
appalled Civil Lord of the Admiralty what he supposed his consti-
tuents in Dundee would say when they read his speech, in which
bang went millions as if they were saxpences? “What will the
worthy citizens say, Mr. MELLORP” he repeated. “Why they will
say, “Ma conscience!’”
Rev. since Dominie Sampson made this remark has so much
fervour and gocq Scotch accent been thrown in. “Where's the
CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUERP” MAcGREGoR presently asked,
evidently eager for fresh blood.
-- º: has nothing to do with the question,” said the Chairman,
severely.
“Oh, hasn't it?” jeered the MAcGREGoR. “I want to ask him
what he has done with our money.””
Vision instantly conjured up before eyes of Committee of SQUIRE
of MALwood prowling about town with his pockets loaded
with £4,132,500, voted to defray the charge for wages in the
Navy, flinging the cash about like JACK ashore, making the most of
his time bºfore Local Veto became theiaw of the land.
It was later that the MACGREGoR came in unconscious competition
with Alderman Cotton. Leaving the Navy for a moment he surveyed
the Continent of Europe peopled with armed men. “Why?" he
cried, with comprehensive sweep of his arm, “these great armies
are like fighting cocks. The least spark blows them up like maga-
zines of powder.” . . .

So after Asquith talks for an hour and a quarter, HICKS-BEACH

Afterwards a dreary night. Papers on subject read by Members,
who rise alternately from either side. Few listen; newspaper
reports cruelly curt; nevertheless, it’s the thing to do, and will go
on through at least four sittings. On last night men whom
Bouse want to hear will speak, as they might have spoken on first

SPIRITS.”
PUMPED OUT!
THE STUDIO SEEKER'S WADE MECUM.
Question. On what occasions do you particularly seek the studios ?
Answer. On two Sundays in the year—the consecutive sabbaths
devoted to the exhibition of proposed academy pictures by “Out-
siders.” and “A.’s,” and “R.A.’s.”
Q. Do you haunt the abodes of artists at other times?
A. Never; or, to cover all possibilities, hardly ever.
Q. Then you are not a lover of paintings for their own sake?
A. Certainly not; on the contrary, I am, as a rule, a better judge
of frames than canvases.
Q. Then why do you go to St. John's Wood, Chelsea and West
Kensington P
A. To see and be seen.
- $.” it necessary to know the artist whose pictures are “on
View
A. Certainly not. You can usually single him out by the absence
of an overcoat, and can generally spot his wife and daughter by the
**** of promenading head-gear.
Q. at have you to do when you have discovered your involun-
tary host and hostess?
A. To shake hands with them with condescension, and partake of
their refreshments with gusto.
Q. Will this invasion of the domestic circle be resented P
A. No ; because it is . probable that you will be mistaken
for a newspaper Art critic, and respect for the Press in Art circles is
universal.
Q. Arenot artists, as a body, a community of highly accomplished
gentlemen? -
4. Certainly; and, consequently, on ordinary occasions entitled to
well-merited respect.
Q. Then why should that “well-merited respect” be refused to
them a month before the May opening of Burlington House?
A. Because it is the fashion.
Q. Surely this fashion does not exist amongst the better classes of
the community?
4. To some extent; although it certainly is in greatest favour
with cads and snobs, to say nothing of their female relations.
Q. Has any effort been made to stem this tide of unauthorised
and unwelcome invasion ?
4. In isolated cases the master of the studio has sought the
protection of the police to keep his studio free of the unknown and
the unknowable.
Q. But could not the scandal be removed with the assistance of
the leaders of Society?
.4. Assuredly. It would only have to become unfashionable to
visit studios on the Show Sundays for the painter to be left at peace.
Q. Would that be pleasing to the artists f
A. That is the published opinion, but the matter has not been put
absolutely to the test. However, the pleasure of the artists is not to be
considered when the recreations of Brixton and Tooting are at stake.
APRIL FOOLOSOPHY.
(By One of Them.)
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread. Well, this only shows
our valiant disregard of danger, our readiness of initiative, our cham-
piºnship of forlorn hopes. We are the heaven-sent leaders of all
"New" enterprises, whether literary, theatrical, or artistic. It is
we who penetrate the mysteries of Bodleyosophy, Beardsleyotechny,
and Yellow Astrology.. We are the real and only Mahatmaniacs,
Sexomaniacs, Miasmaniacs. Among our ranks you will find, the
Women who Did, the anticonjugallias, the shedon Keynotes, and all
their attendant and Discordant tribe of Jack-asses. We are the
elect and proper bell-wethers of mankind. Come to us, then, for
guidance.
Where ignorance is bliss, 'tis folly to be wise. Folly is there-
fore the true wisdom. , However, this is an Oscarian dox, which
the Divine WILLIAMs has previously plagiarised, and enlarged on at
some length, so we will pass on.
Fools build houses, but wise men live in them. Exactly so; we are
the architects of this generation. The wise man depends on us for
his roof and lodging; and without us he would be homeless. We
have built “Snookson's Folly” and “Babel Mansions”—half of
London, in fact. The jerry-builders have done the rest.
A fool and his money are soon parted. A compliment to our open-
handed and indiscriminate generosity. It is we who swell the sub-
scription list for the last new gold mine or building society; who
subsidise insolvent South American Republics; who support the
mendicant tramp and the deserving blackmailer. -
There is no fool like an old fool. That is, the quality of folly im-
proves with keeping, like that of wine. The seniors of our class are
thoroughly reliable old fools, and Past Grand Masters in the art of
ineptitude. We, fools as we are, know how to pay the proper
respect that is due to senility and second-childishness. -
A fool at forty is a fool indeed. This is a corollary of the preceding
aphorism, for it is only at the age of two-score that we attain to
ears of full indiscretion. We develop later than the rest of
umanity; we undergo a severe probation before our claim to the
title of complete nincompoop is recognised. Before forty there is yet
a chance that the budding ninny may desert, and degenerate into a
§: a Philistine, or a physician. After that age he is safe, and can
be depended on for un om, whereas your ordinary wiseacre cuts
his back teeth and graduates in common-sense at twenty-one.
º Fools stand in slippery places—where wise men tumble
down; but this needs no further illustration than that provided years
ago by C. K., in Mr. Punch's pages.
Not FoE THEIR “BEN.”—Judging from some of the evidence at
the recent trial of Tillett v. “The Morning” (Limited), it .
occurred to the unemployed dockers that they might have been well
employed in “docking” B.T.’s salary.

The March sunshine slants in pale shafts through the clerestory
windows, leaving the aisles in shadow. From without, the
cawing of rooks and shouts of children, at play are faintly
audible. By the West Door, a party of Intending Sightseers
have collected, and the several groups, feeling that it would be a

MARco Polo ULysses HENRY NoHMAN,

in a handsome volume published by FISHER
UNwiN. The Far East is its alluring and
well-sustained title. But why drag in Ulysses

China is peculiarly interesting just now, and
Mr. NoHALAN throws a flood of light on the
state of the unwieldly empire. The descrip-
tion of the examination halls is instructive.
The Government of China, Mr. NoHMAN testi-
fies, is a vast system of competitive examina-

out successfully in examinations—the subject-

CoNFUCIUs, the history of China, and the art
of writing as practised by the old masters—
have berths found them under the Government.

v. Joseph, “Times’” Report, March 27.]
ALL hail to Sir HENRY, whom nothing surprises;
Ye Judges and suitors, regard him with awe,
As he sits up aloft on the Bench and º: his
Swift mind to the shifts and the tricks of the Law.
Many years has he lived, and has always seen clear things
That Nox seemed to hide from our average eyes: -
But still, though encompassed with all sorts of queer things,
He never, no never gives way to surprise.
When a rogue, for example, a company-monger,
Grows fat on the gain of the shares he has sold
While the public gets lean, winning nothing but hunger
And a few scraps of scrip for its masses of gold;
When the fat man goes further and takes to religion,
A rascal in hymn-books and bibles disguised,
“It’s a case,” says Sir HENRY," of rook rersus pigeon,
And the pigeon gets left—well, I’m hardly surprised.”
There's a Heath at Newmarket, and horses that run there,
There are owners and jockeys, and . and flats;
There are some who do nicely, and some who are done there,
There are loud men with pencils and satchels and hats.
But the Stewards see nothing of betting or money,
As they stand in the blinkers for Stewards devised;
Their blindness may strike HENRY HAwKINs as funny,
But he only smiles softly, he isn't surprised.
So, here's to Sir HENRY, the terror of tricksters,
Of Law he's a master, and likewise a limb:
Let them try to deceive him, why, bless you, he's been there,
And can track his way straight through a tangle of lies;
And, though some might grow grey at the things he has seen there,
He never, no never, gives way to surprise.

easing the º: of working-men magistrates, and assisting
operation of Parish Councils Act. Only, somehow, there was left on
minds of hearers a strong impression
that working-men magistrates are a
mistake, and the Parish Councils Act
a public injury, of which the Govern-
ment ought to be more than ordinarily
ashamed.
Business done. — More speech-
making round Welsh Disestablishment
Bill in Commons. Direfully dull.
House of Commons, Tuesday. —
“Speakers may come, and Speakers
may go,” said the Member for SARK,
“but as long as the House of Commons
roduces men like WICARY GIBBs the
institution is safe, and the State rocks
safely on its everlasting foundations.
It was, you will remember, Vicary
who directly, though undesignedly,
led to the row on that famous night in
June when Home-Rule Committee was
closured. WICARY shares with Heaven
the peculiarity that order is his first
law. On that particular night some-
body had said something, and WICARY
wanted to have his words taken down.
Amid growing uproar his observations
were inaudible to the Chair, and his
presence undistinguishable. Some men
would thereupon have resumed their
seat. WICARy, his soul athirst to have
something ‘taken down,” moved on
to the Front Opposition. Bench, and
shouted his desire in MELLOR's left
ear. Then LoGAN suddenly loomed
large on the scene. HAYES FISHER
reached forth a red right hand and shook him by the collar. Next an
anonymous Irish Member felloyer the bench on to SAUNDERson's knee,
and was there incontinently but heartily pummelled. After that
chaos; all arising out of WICARY GIBBs's insatiable, uncontrollable
desire to have something ‘taken down” in the sacred name of order.”
These musings on the mighty past were occasioned by WICARY once
more unexpectedly, but sternly and effectively, interposing as the
custodian of order. WEIR broken out in epidemic of questions; puts
down eleven on the paper; runs them up to the full score by supple-
mentary questions, invariably prefaced by the formula “Is the right
hon. gentleman A. WEIR that—?” A poor joke, its only flash
of humour being in the subtly varied tone with which the SPEAKER
eleven times pronounced the words, “Mr. WEIR.” Also grotesquel
funny to hear the reverberation of the deep chest notes, in whic
WEIR, with tragic sweep of pince-nez on †. nose, said in succes-
sion, “Ques-ti-on one,” “Ques-ti-on two,” and so on.
Touch of tragedy came in when WICARY, managing to throw into
tone and form of question conviction that SQUIRE of MALwood was
secretly at bottom of the whole business, asked him whether this was
not abuse of forms of the House, calculated to lead to curtailment of
valuable privilege. No use SQUIRE assuming air of innocence.
House knew all about it. , Refreshed and revived by WICARY's timely
vindication of law and order, proceeded to business.
Business done.—Fourth night's Debate on Welsh Church Dises-
tablishment Bill. The still prevalent dulness varied by speech from
PLUNKET; witched the House by music of stately #. simple
eloquence.
Thursday.—Desperate dulness of week further relieved by dis-
covery of new game. ToMMY Bowles, Inc. ... House just got into
Committee of Supply; Vote on Account under discussion; this covers
multitudinous items; every spending department of State concerned.
When Committee of Supply deals with Army Estimates, CAwMELL-

of Ministers may go away, knowing that everything is well. The
same when Navy, Estimates are on, or when particularyotes in the
Civil Service Estimates are to the fore. Ministers of particular
departments affected in their place; the rest at liberty.
o-night, as no one knew who might be called on next, all agreed
to stop away—all but the faithful HIBBERT. Cap'en ToMMY, as
usual, aloft in the Crow's Nest, perceived this weak point. Hauling
on the bowline, and making taut, he bore down swiftly on the
Treasury Bench, and hailed it for the President of the Board of

far as to move to report progess.
MELLOR declined to put question.
“Wery well,” said the Blameless
BARTLEY, with air of martyr. “We
must go on talking about Peterhead
Harbour till the Minister comes in.”
So he did, and when he ran dry
ToMLINSoN (having meanwhile ascer-

now swelling with maternal pride and

Harbour subsided, Busy B's turning
their attention, to alleged felonious
underrating of Government property.

calls Asquith's attention to dangerous
occupation of lion-tamers. “All very

Friday Night.—“What’s the business at to-night's sitting P”
asked SQUIRE of MALwood, looking, over Orders of the Day,
“Home Rule all round? Wery well. Shall give practical proof of
adherence to principle by stopping at home.' . - ...
John MoRLEY did same, most other Ministers following suit.
CAwMFL-BANNERMAN sacrificed himself on altar, of country. But
insisted that he might at least dine out in interval between morning.
and evening sitting that made last day of Parliamentary week. His
snowy shirt front gave air of almost reckless joviality to desolate:
Treasury Bench. PRINCE ARTHUR, not to be outdone in chivalry,
also looked in after dinner, brightening up Front Bench opposite:
Minister for War. But two swallows don't make a summer, nor two:

Business done.—Home Rule all round decreed by majority of 26

marked that the plea of infancy was not a very meritorious one. “No,'
replied the defendant, “but it's jolly convenient.”—The Globe.]
WHEN, toddling along with a swell, I pretend
Not to notice a shabby (though excellent)friend,-
Well, it is not lofty, to that I assent,
But then, “it’s sojolly con-ve-ni-ent!”
When a tenant has built up a business with care,
And saved to his landlord all cost of repair,
It may not be kind just to double his rent;
Yet somehow “it’s jolly con-ve-ni-ent!”
If you’ve suffered, in polling, a “moral defeat,”
Then to grab each Committee and every paid seat
Some might say was the act of a “cad,” not a “gent”;
But, you see, “it’s sojolly con-ve-ni-ent!”
Then your house is for sale, and, if gifted with brains, .
You, of course, do not mention the damp, rats, and drains
Which is not what the ancients by “honesty” meant,

Trade. Wanted to talk to BRYCE, he said, about lighthouses. No
But, still, it is “jolly con-ve-ni-ent!”

Almost into "wreathèd smiles.”

Mere nonentities like PITT.

In his most expansive

E'er has twined a

So I cast—in no de-
rision—
From my 'bus-top
garden-seat
These few violets,
with precision,
At what I must call thy feet.
'Tis not that thy mien is stately,
'Tis not that thy grace is rare,
'Tis not that I care so greatly
For thy quaint heraldic air;
But contemptuous men neglect thee,
Load thee with invective strange,
So with violets I have decked thee,
And with verses, as a change.

scribed as..." a gaseous, constituent.”. In

badinage with youths of their acquaintance, though the latter

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
GENERAL ADYE has added to our national war story Recollections
of a Military Life (SMITH, ELDER & Co.). Sir JoHN has not been in
a hurry. He began fighting more than forty years ago, and has since
filled up opportunity as it presented itself. These particular recol-
lections are chiefly occupied with the Crimean War and the Indian
Mutiny, though the old soldier has something to say about the
Afghan War of 1878-9, and the
Egyptian War of 1882. My
Baronite finds most interesting
the chapters about the Crimean
War, certain incidents and epi-
sodes of which are narrated
with soldierlike directness and
simplicity. ... The story of the
Balaclava Charge has been told
in verse and prose innumerable
times. General ADYE did not
actually see it, “a ridge of
intervening hills intercepting
the view” as he rode back to
the camp from Balaclava. But
- he manages in a sentence or two
- --- vividly to impress the scene on
the mind of the reader. *::::: any goodstoriesis one about General
HARRY Jones. PELIssier, with a Frenchman's scorn of any language
but his own, got as near as he could to ordinary pronunciation when he
called him “General HAIRy-Jozº.”. He did 3. when the gallant

THREE MODES OF SPENDING A BANK HOLIDAY.
(By a Confirmed Pessimist.)
Plan the First.—Take to Volunteering. Be up at daybreak.
Leave your home after snatching a hasty breakfast of lukewarm tea
and stale bread-and-butter. Crowd into a railway-carriage, and
travel a hundred miles or so in the greatest discomfort. Fall in
with your company. March, counter-march, and stand at ease for
ten hours or so in sunshine, rain, fog, or snow. Stave off starva-
tion with a packet of sandwiches and a bottle of ginger ale. Dead
beat, enter crowded train a second time, and again travel a hundred
miles or so in the greatest discomfort. More dead than alive, stagger
home, and wearily roll into bed.
Plan the Second.—Try a trip to the sea-side. Share a first-class
compartment with a dozen third-class passengers. Travel to
Shrimpington with the accompaniment of rank tobacco-smoke,
comic songs, and solos on the concertina. Get to your destina-
tion with a splitting headache. Find that all the shops are shu
and all the taverns open. Learn that Shrimpington, as represent
by its respectable inhabitants, goes away en masse on a bank
holiday. Discover that there is but one hotel in the place. Ascer-
tain that at the solitary hostelry the rooms. are filled with noisy
excursionists, *# devouring “the shilling tea.” Search for
nourishment, and fail in your search. Fall back upon stale buns
at a third-rate sweet-stuff shop. Catch your train back, and endure
the torture of the morning. Travel amongst the same company
under the like conditions. Reach home hours later than you pro sed
on starting, and consider whether the holiday has been a triumphant
success or a dismal failure.
Plan the Third (highly recommended). — Although desiring
change, remain at home, choosing the lesser of two evils.

THREE MODES OF SPENDING A BANK HOLIDAY.

travel a hundred miles or so in the greatest discomfort. Fall in
with your company. March, counter-march, and stand at ease for
ten hours or so in sunshine, rain, fog, or snow. Stave off starva-
tion with a packet of sandwiches and a bottle of ginger ale. Dead
beat, enter crowded train a second time, and again travel a hundred
miles or so in the greatest discomfort. More dead than alive, stagger
home, and wearily roll into bed.
Plan the Second.—Try a trip to the sea-side. Share a first-class
compartment with a dozen third-class Fº Travel to
Shrimpington with the accompaniment of rank tobacco-smoke,
comic songs, and solos on the concertina. Get to your destina-
tion with a splitting headache. Find that all the shops are shut
and all the taverns open. Learn that Shrimpington, as represented
by its respectable inhabitants, goes away en masse on a bank
holiday. Discover that there is but one hotel in the place. Ascer-
tain that at the solitary hostelry the rooms are filled with noisy
excursionists, greedily devouring “the shilling tea.” Search for
nourishment, and fail in your search. Fall back upon stale buns
at a third-rate sweet-stuff shop. Catch your train back, and endure
the torture of the morning. Travel amongst the same company
under the like conditions. Reach home hours later than you º:
on starting, and consider whether the holiday has been a triumphant
success or a dismal failure.

change, remain at home, choosing the lesser of two evils.

SATURDAY NIGHT IN THE EDGWARE ROAD.
For over half a mile the pavement on the East side of the road is
thronged with promenaders, and the curbstone lined with stalls
and barrows, and hawkers of various wares. Marketing house-
wires with covered baskets oscillate undecidedly from stalls to
shops, and put off purchasing to the last possible moment.
Maids-of-all-work perambulate arm in arm, exchanging airy
badinage with youths of their acquaintance, though the latter
seem to prefer the society of their own ser. . A man with a
switchback skittle-board plays gloomy games by himself to an
unspeculative group of small boys. The tradesmen standoutside
their shops and conduct their business with a happy blend of
the methods of a travelling
showman and a clown.

Hear how his heart rejoices—

Booms his most bass of voices.
He cocks a snook at slate and book.
He's had his work this term, .
But has contrived, by hook or crook,
To keep his footing firm, boys.
H †: to fight, like DIBDIN's tar,
y many a would-be boarder.
It needed wit as well as war
To keep the school in order. . .
But he has shown both wit and grit,
And patience linked about it.

Young ARTY hears him shout it.
ARTY had hoped he could have co
With BILL, and licked him hollow ;
That JACK had kicked, and SANDY moped,
And PAT refused to follow.
But BILL has proved a dodgy one,
As well as a hard hitter;
And that has somewhat marred the fun,
And ..º.º. 's bitter.
What wonder then BILL's Tra-la-la
Sets ARTY shouting shrilly,
“Boohoo and ! Yah-boo-yah-bahl

And you look blessed ‘.

And you the pace would quicken!
Over 3%. roll long ere the goal,
And then the fun will thicken!”—
BIII, cocks his chins, and skips and grins
Like any J umpinºingle.
His loud Ha, ha! Tra-la-la-la]
Sets ARTY's blood a-tingle.
“Bah! You've done fairly well this half:

And did not live next door!

|NOT DONE YET.
A SoNG of St. STEPHEN's School.
(To the Air of the Harrow Song, “Fairies.”)
WHEN in the Springtime cold and bleak,
ln }. of wind and weather,
The Blues and Buffs, the strong and weak-
ng out of school together;
Off to their homes alert and gay
From long sederunts risen
Majors and minors rush to play,
ve lags let loose from prison.
There you behold “Big BfLL,” the bold!
Hear how his heart rejoices—
Hohol ha hal, Tra-ſa-la-la!”—
Booms his most bass of voices.
He cocks a snook at slate and book.
He's had his work this term, boys,
But has contrived, by hook or crook,
To $º his footing firm, boys.
H., had to fight, like DIBDIN's tar,
'Gainst many a would-be boarder.
It needed wit as well as war
To keep the school in order.
But he has shown both wit and grit,
And patience linked about it.
“Hohol hahal Tra-la-la-la!”—
Young ARTY hears him shout it.
ARTY had hoped he could have co
With BILL, and licked him hollow;
That JACK had kicked, and SANDY moped,
And PAT refused to follow.
But BILL has proved a dodgy one,
As well as a hard hitter;
And that has somewhat marred the fun,
And disappointment’s bitter.
What wonder then BILL's Tra-la-la
Sets ARTY shouting shrilly,
“Boohoo and ! Yah-boo-yah-bah!
“With spur and rein, whip-stroke and
strain,
Jehu plus artful jockey,
You've kept your team in tow again,
And you look blessed cocky,
Wait till the way shows * and clay,
And you the pace would quicken!
Over {} 'll roll long ere the goal,
And then the fun will thicken!”—
BIII, cocks his chins, and skips and grins
Like any J untinºingle.
His loud Ha, ha! Tra-la-la-la]
Sets ARTY's blood a-tingle.
“Bah! You’ve done fairly well this half:
Think you'll survive another
As the school's ‘Cock,' you great fat calf P
Look out for my Big Brotherl
When he gets hold of you, -my eyeſ—
You won't look quite so §: -
Think you’ve licked me! Wait till you try
A round or two with SoLLY!
He's waiting for a turn at you!
You think yºu're a smart smiter?
“Tra-la-la-la”? Yah! bully!, yah!
He'll show you who's ghter!”
To Tara, My (Un-)Fair Neighbour.
(“Moore”—where this comes from.)
“THE harp that once through TARA's walls”
Poor me disturbed in bed,
Is nightly twang'd to feline squalls
That wrack my aching head.
I sleep not as informer days,
Her voice ories “Sleep no more!”
Ah, would she hadn't got this craze,
And did not live next door!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“TO PARIS AND BACK FOR NOTHING.”
(To the Editor of “Punch.”)
SIR,--A most excellent institution, run on moral lines, has recently
been advertising “A tour on the Continent” for £5. This modest sum
is to cover travelling and hotel expenses, and no doubt has been
worked out on the most virtuous principles. In these days of rapid
8." however, we can never stand still, and the question arises,
ot the holiday be cheapened? I contend it can, and as your
paper represents the human race in general and the British public in
particular, I desire to make known my discovery through, your
columns. Of course “Trips for nothing”—the journeys, I wish to
organise—cannot be managed without a little thought and arrange-
ment. For my purpose it is best not to insist too harshly upon the
importance of truth and honesty. After all, both these words represent
abstract ideas, that may be necessary for publication, but need not be
absolutely accepted as a guarantee of : faith.
Without further preface Ijot down my programme. Say that a
would-be traveller without means desires to visit the Capital of
France gratuitously. I would have him present himself at the
Victoria Station garbed in the uniform of a guard. The necessary
costume, on application, would be supplied to him by...one of the
agents of the Unprincipled Touring Company—the institution, it is
my aim to establish, Just as the night mail was starting for Dover
he would enter the luggage-van, and then all would be clear until he
reached Paris. He would accompany the boxes and portmanteaus to
Calais, and be transferred (being registered) to the Chemin de Ferdu
Nord, and remain undisturbed until he reached the terminus.
On coming out of the van he would be met by one of the agents of

IIouse of Commons, Monday, April 1.-There is about John AIRD
an artlessness of leok and manner the price whereof is beyond rubies.
SARK fancies it is the beard that has much to do with it. When you
get a man light-hearted as a boy endowed with long grey beard, com-
plications certain to ensue. AIRD's beard has precisely same |r-
naturally proper look whether he is sitting in parish church listening
to sermon, or dancing a hornpipe on the white deck of the P. & O.
Caledonia. Only he dances better than the average rector preaches.
Just the man to take part in the old Parliamentary game known as
asking friendly question. Usually played with Minister taking a
hand. . If Treasury Bench wants to bring out some fact or appear-
ance of fact Whip gets Member on back bench to put question on
subject. Pretty to see Minister on such occasions; his startled look
on łºn; himself addressed; his glance round to see if this is really
his hon, friend who is presuming to trouble him with what might be
awkw inquiry; then his slow, almost hesitating answer which
*i. corrects a calumny or nips a slander i' th' bud.
To-night, in view of pending division on second reading Welsh
Disestablishment Bill it was felt desirable to produce effect of over-
whelmin fº. indignation at threatened spoliation of the Church.
Since Bill introduced petitions against it been dribbling in from
teeming *. ulation of English hamlets sternly saying This thing

“TO PARIS AND BACK FOR NOTHING.”
(To the Editor of “Punch.”)
SIR,-A most excellent institution, run on moral lines, has recently
been advertising “A tour on the Continent” for £5. This modest sum
is to cover travelling and hotel expenses, and no doubt has been
worked out on the most virtuous principles. In these days of rapid
8." however, we can never stand still, and the question arises,
annot the holiday be cheapened? I contend it can, and as, your
paper represents the human race in general and the British public in
particular, I desire to make known my discovery through, your
columns. Of course “Trips for nothing”—the journeys, I wish to
organise—cannot be managed without a little thought and arrange-
ment. For my purpose it is best not to insist too harshly upon the
importance of truth and honesty. After all, both these words represent
abstract ideas, that may be necessary tºº. but need not be
absolutely accepted as a guarantee of good faith.
Without further preface Ijot down my programme, Say that a
would-be traveller without means desires to visit the Capital of
France gratuitously. I would have him present himself at the
Victoria Station garbed in the uniform of a guard. The necessary
costume, on application, would be supplied to him by...one of the
agents of the Unprincipled Touring Company—the institution, it is
my aim to establish, Just as the night mail was starting for Dover
he would enter the luggage-van, and then all would be clear until he
reached Paris. He would accompany the boxes and portmanteaus to
Calais, and be transferred (being registered) to the Chemin de Ferdu
Nord, and remain undisturbed until he reached the terminus.
On coming out of the van he would be met by one of the agents of
the Unprincipled Touring Company, and be accused of being a spy.
This would immediately secure his arrest and safe custody in a
Parisian police-station. The agent, having played his part, would
disappear. It would now become the duty (and I trust the pleasure)
of the would-be traveller to look after himself without further
assistance. He would appeal to the British Ambassador. He would
tell his simple tale, how he had been drugged and conveyed in a state
of coma to the luggage-van; how he had no money, and had been
so affected by the narcotics, that his mind had become a perfect blank.
The British Minister would, doubtless, secure his release, and supply
him with funds. He would see some of the cheaper sights for which
Paris is celebrated, and then return home by an inexpensive route,
hiº. with his adventures. -
t will doubtless occur, in this practical age, to persons having even
the most moderate amount of brains, that hitherto the profits of the
Unprincipled Touring Company have remained unmentioned.
“Where do they come in?” will be the universal question. My
answer is simply, “Hush money.” The would-be traveller, having
availed himself of the services of the proposed organisation, would,
for the remainder of his existence, be under an obligation to pay as
much as he could conveniently (or even inconveniently) spare to a
º which had secured for him so much semi-innocent recrea-
10n.

effect by reason of ordinary procedure whereby petitions presented
at the Table are straightway thrust into a sack, and carted off to a
lumber room. Thing to do was to get Member to publicly inquire
from Chairman of Petitions Committee how the matter stood in the
ledger; how many petitions against Bill, how many in favour.
Who could do this better than John AIRD? So he put question to
DALRYMPLE, and learned with dramatically ill-concealed surprise
that whilst over a thousand petitions against the Bill have poured in
on the House, not one had been received in its favour. It is true
that another question from opposite side of House brought out fact
that at least one of these State documents was result of labours of
wife of Clerk.to Guardians, of St. Asaph Union, who had been
instrumental in obtaining the unbiassed opinion of the resident
paupers on question at issue. But that a mere detail.
Business done.—Second Reading Welsh Disestablishment Bill
carried by, majority of 44 in House of 564 Members. “Clwych.'
Clwych "roared MABON, and was with difficulty restrained from
singing “The March of the Men of Harlech.”
Tuesday.—Evidently in for another dull time... Welsh Disestablish-
ment Bill off, enter Irish Land Bill. Time precious; business press-
ing; every.guarter of hour worth a Chancellor of the Exchequer's
ransom. Ministers anxious above all things to get along with
business. JoHN MoRLEY, accordingly, sets ji example by deliver-
ing *: an hour and twenty minutes long. This, as he men-
tioned, followed upon exorbitant demands on patience of House
when he introduced the Bill. CARson, not to be outdone, certainly
not to be blamed, took up about as much time. Later came St.
JoBN BRodRICK, astonished at his own moderation in speaking for
only seventy minutes. -
“This is not debating,” SARK says. “It is just making speeches
by the yard. Hasn’t the remotest effect upon the human mind, still
less upon deliberate action of House. Isn't even pretence of a fight;
second reading will be passed without division; Bill will go to
Committee in precisely same state as would have been the case had
it been read a second time before dinner, and Members spent rest of
evening in bosom of their families. Towards end of Session there will
be complaint of nothing done. At least Treasury Bench mustn't lift
up its voice in reproach at such conclusion. If right hon, gentlemen
set us such evil example, they mustn't complain if we follow it.”
House in desolate state throughout spirit-sapping performance.
TIM HEALY sat it all out. , Contributed almost only token of life to
the dull monotony. In dangerously explosive state. If anybody
had sat on safety-valve would have burst to dead certainty. Happily
got off a few life-saving grunts and groans. Played sort of chorus to
CARson s speech and BRoprick's monologue. They severely ignored
him—treatment which had no effect on his exuberance of spirits.
“Who are these Irish owners,” BRODRICK asked, looking severely
across table at John Mobley, “who want to buy their tenants'
interest in order to sell it at a higher price?”
“I’ll give you their names,” cried TIM, after the fashion of the
naughty boy safe at the outer edge of a crowd.
“I defy the right hon.
gentleman to prºduce a.
single instance,” BRODRICK
continued, taking no notice
of TIM.
“I’ll give you half a
dozen,” shouted TIM, ever
ready to oblige, though
leaving it in doubt whether
the half dozen he offered
were lashes or other in-
- stances. Then the police-
man, in shape of SPEAKER,
appeared on scene, and for
awhile there was silence on
the back benches, and dull-
ness regained its swav.

Emblem (Unsuited to the Convenience of The heart of Ireland stirred

sons, turning up on parade on St. Patrick's Day proudly wearing
shamrock, were ordered by brutal Saxon officers to “fling it on the
und.” TIM HEALY had cases brought under his notice. Never
o, for this branch of United Ireland to appear as sole champion of
national rights in this matter. So wearisome WILLIE REDMond
swaggers on scene with another case.
On one hand, discipline must be maintained. On the other, national
sentiment must not
be affronted, espe-
cially when repre-
sented in House by

tily apologetic air,
“stand in a some-
what neutral posi-
tion, because I be-
long to a country

convenience of the

House laughed
at idea of CAwmEL-
BANNERMAN bust-
ling in on St. An-

bunch of thistles
in his button-hole.
With the laugh
the battle was won;

T. W. Russell between Landlord and Tenant.
Business done.-Still explaining why we are not going
to oppose Second Reading Irish Land Bill, though we regard it as
most revolutionary and dangerous measure of recent times.
Friday-Second reading Irish Land Bill through at last. Passed
stage without division, which seems odd considering apprehension
with which Opposition regard it. Situation largely due to BoANERGEs
Russell, one of few men who understand Bill. Explained it in
luminous speech, like some others thrown away on scanty audience.
BoANERGEs later indicated his impartial attitude by seating himself
between landlord and tenant, represented by Joseph ..";
ham and son AUSTEN. JoE incidentally mentions he has only one
tenant, that is AUSTEN, “who,” he added, with plaintive note,
which found echo with the Irish landlords, “pays no rent, and is
always coming down on me for compensation.”
Business done.—Irish Land Bill read second time.
LITERARY “FOOD AND FEEDING.”
THE present generation affirms that it cannot away with Pickwick,
and is not attracted by Vanity Fair. The balance of modern
opinion would be rather in favour of THACKERAY than of DICKENs,
Take, for example, the two works already quoted, Pickwick and
Vanity Fair. A common modern objection made to Pickwick is,
that the characters in Pickwick are perpetually guttling or imbibing,
or both simultaneously. This is, to a certain extent, true. But how
about THAcKERAY's characters in Vanity Fair? A careful student
has sent us a list of the numerous eatings and drinkings in both
novels. . In Pickwick, reckoning from the brandy-and-water par-
taken of by Mr. Jingle, at the Pickwickians' expense, after the scene
with the pugnacious hackney-coachman, and finishing with the
breakfast that celebrated the marriage of Mr. Snodgrass with Miss
Emily Wardle, there are exactly ". we are informed) one hundred
and one instances of drinking and eating ; some of them being of
drinking only, unqualified.
In , Vanity Fair, from the introduction of Miss Pinkerton's
“seed cake,” to Becky taking Amelia a cup of tea, ride chapter
sixty-seven, we learn, on the same authority, that there are one
. and fifteen cases “allowed for refreshment” in some form
or other.
A collection of the meals of heroes and heroines in the most popular
works of fiction, and menus compiled therefrom, might be found
interesting, especially if carefully criticised by Sir HENRY THoMPson
in a separate chapter to be added to the next edition of his really
invaluable work, namely, Food and Feeding. Do the modern
novelists feed their characters as plentifully as did Dickens and
THACKERAY theirs? Be this as it may, these two great Twin
Brethren—so utterly dissimilarin everything except in the possession


A delicate subject for SECRETARY of STATE FoR WAR to handle.

girl! What a charming nurse she must be! - Almost wish I was
laid up at the hospital. In fact, quite wish it. But I can’t be.
Another outrage on the miserable, downtrodden, middle class. If I
were one of the fortunate, pampered masses, a Working Man, I
should be nursed by her, if I were ill, and by others, perhaps, like
her. Stay! There is a chance. If I could be damaged in an
accident—not too much damaged—and carried to the hospital, they
must look after me, and nurse me. They couldn't help themselves.
Northumberland Avenue—the very place! Never cross it without
being nearly run over.
Go straight there and look eagerly for the usual rushing hansoms.
Here’s one. Stroll in front of it. Driver pulls aside, shouts and
swears at me, and goes on. Reflect that some caution is neces-
sary. If the wheel went over my neck, even her ministrations would
be useless. Must be run over judiciously. Better only be knocked
down. Stroll across road again. Here comes one. Shouts from
driver. A large splash of mud in mw eye. And that’s all. These
cabmen drive so absurdly well. They pull up, or pull aside, or
pull somewhere instantly. Wipe my eye, and then see something
better. Old lady's brougham, from the suburhs, driven by the sort
of coachman who also works in the garden. He won't be able to pull
aside quicklv. Stroll in front of horse. Shouts from gardening
coachman. Horse nearly on me. Suddenly pnlled hack by fussy
policeman, who says I had a narrow escape. Hang the fellow, of
course I did! Am obliged to give him ten shillings for his prompt
action. Begin to despair of this accident. Stroll on nearly to Em-
hankment. Immense van coming along at a trot. Much too heavy.
I should be smashed flat. And this driver seems to want to run
over me. Escape with difficulty by jumping aside. At that moment
something hits my legs, I am thrown down, and a wheel passes over
my foot. It is a costermonger's donkey-cart which was racing the
van. How ignominions! To be knocked down by a donkey and run
over by a truck! Very painful too. Feel as if I should faint.
Picked up by sympathetic people who rush to me. Say feebly to
them, “Take me to the hospital.” Then faint.
After a short time open my eves. Am being carried in somewhere.
At last! I shall forget the pain. I am in the hospital. She will
nurse me! She-oh, heavens! Though I have planned, it all,
snppose I ought to murmur, “Where am I?” Do so. “In St.
Thomas's Hospital,” says somebody,
A fortnight later.—And I am in it still
AccompINg to a paragraph last week in the Westminster Gazette,

Will no casual icy splinter from the serried spears of Winter
Put a chill upon your smile, and spoil the promise of the Summer ?

And belated almond-blossoms show like roses of Cashmere:

What malignant hocus-pocus has kept back the plucky crocus,
Whose gold is scarce yet bursting from the beds the winds still

After that six weeks cold snap, dear, of fast frozen pipe and tap, So
dear,
When back to barbarism and to bathlessness fate drove us,
And we sicklier grew, and surlier, if you’d come a leetle earlier,
wa, let bygones now be bygones! But O Spring sweet! an you

Come—at last, dear—d la HERRICK, with such influence atmospheric
As will slay the Influenza; with such f Lice jº flowers,
As will knock Malaria silly; let your jº. illy

Morbid sickliness surrounds us in our lives, our books, our art.
Oh, if sunshine and your breezes might but § our soul-diseases,
Oust the pestilent miasma that pervades the home, the mart;
Neutralise the nauseous virus whose developments so tire us;
Disinfect the New Parnassus, purge the New Pierian Spring,
Bring us honesty and health, dear, why for all our wit and wealth,
ear,
We might love like Nature's lovers, and like Nature's poets sing.
Ah! we need Spring's prophylacticl–But I’m getting too didactic
For a sunny April morning, and a sweet #. thing like you.

DUNNo WAHRLAR is
perhaps the most re-

He belongs ('tis true) to the Literary Upper Crust, and is for the
few rather than the many; while so absolute has been his fidelity to

the principles of his art, that he has
at a considerable pecuniary loss.
Need, I say, more to ensure for him that respectful admiration
which the £; lic is ever ready to lavish upon anything they fail to

Let me rather efface myself and leave DUNNo WAHRLAR—or
“Young GARNAway,” as is his self-adopted pseudonym—to unfold
the rhythmic charm of his own inimitable incomprehensibility.
BLIND ALLEY-GORY THE FIRST.
THE LOST BACKBONE.
One summer evening, when the moon was at the full, and cloud-
shadows glided imperceptibly over the chimney-pots, as curses that
have found no utterance and come dejectedly home to roost, I wan-
dered into my back-garden, and caught the God of the Period napping
in the moonshine on one of my celery-beds. -
He rose up suddenly and reposed awhile in space, with his head
resting on the back of the Great Bear, and one foot on the arm of
Cassiopeia's Chair, while with the other he skimmed the cream off the
Milky Way. And he seemed to be everywhere and yet nowhere in
particular, and he said nothing, and I was afraid to make a remark
—and there was no sound, save that of the boundless, inconceivable
silence which was rumbling round the corner.
“I saw many myriads of spectral kitten forms and unsubstantial egg-shapes.”
“What are you seeking for so late P” asked he ; “your face looks
so long and solemn, and your eyes are hollow and full of woe. Have
you been having anything indigestible for supper?”
“I am in trouble about Humanity,” I replied; “for, though I

“What’s the matter with Humanity?” asked the God, as he
squatted amid the celery.
“They are growing so deadly dull,” I answered. “I am Young

And while 1 was taking off my goloshes indoors, Iheard again the

LINES IN PLEASANT PLACES.
THE LAND OF DREAMS.
THERE's a wondrous fairy kingdom
Whither all may take a trip-
Quite an inexpensive journey,
It is not by rail or ship—
For it lies just where you fancy,
And a pleasant thing it seems
For a man to sojourn sometimes'
In the land of dreams.
'Tis the land where man attaineth
To the end of his desire,
Where the minor poet warbles
And the laurel crowns his lyre:
It is there the sucking statesman
Works out Machiavellian schemes,
And young BRIEFLEss is a leader
In the land of dreams."
'Tis the land of fur and feather,
'Tis the paradise of sport,
Where the runs beat all recounted
O'er the walnuts and the port:
It is there the pheasant rockets,
It is there the covert teems,
And your powder's always straightest
In the land.of dreams.
There with ease the patient golfer
Plays a record medal-round,
And the batsman get his hundred,
Hitting clean all round the ground;
There old IzAAk's keen disciple
Thrashes quite ideal streams
For he angles most “ compleatly 22
In the land of dreams.
'Tis a land where someone meets you
You may never meet elsewhere,
'Tis a land where words are whispered
You may whisper only there;
'Tis the home of youth and sunshine
Where you taste of joy’s extremes,
For, of course, there's someone loves you
In the land of dreams.
'Tis a land of peace and quiet,
Free from yelling paper-boys,
And from Germany's musicians,
And offensive kinds of noise:
There the organ-grinder grinds not,
There no restive infant screams.
Oh, to spend one's whole existence
In the land of dreams!
'Tis a land where rates and taxes
Never need be brooded on,
And the cupboard is unfurnished
With the homely skeleton:
There the roses all are thornless,
Life is destitute of seams,
And, in short, its worth the living
In the land of dreams.
TO A PRETTY GIRL,

You take my lines, and say that you
Appreciate my humble verses.
That's more thanedi-

I’d write you verses
night and day.

steps, flooding the side galleries, blocking
the Bar, peopling even the steps of the Chair.
ARTHUR PEEL is leaving historic stage graced
through eleven years in fashion that has
added fresh fame to an illustrious name.
On ordinary occasions when SPEAKER rises
to address House on current topics of busi-
ness, Members who chance to have their hats
on keep them there. Now, when the stately
figure is discovered standing under the
º of the Chair, Members without con-
much into fifteen minutes, nothing more
striking than this simultaneous, swift un-
covering of the head. and the transformation
that followed when the rare sunlight, stream-
ing in from western windows, fell upon five
hundred unshaded faces all turned towards
§: tall, gowned figure standing by the
alr.
The speech will be read to-morrow by
millions, who will find it word for word and
sentence by, sentence in the newspapers.
But the reader will gain but faint idea of
the impression the delivery produced. The
historic place, the animated scene, the elec-
tric current of such a gathering, were much.
The effect was perfected by the elocution of
the SPEAKER, perhaps the most perfect de-
velopment of an attractive but dangerous art
possessed by living man.
What possibilities underlie its possession
were wonderingly recognised in the last
days of the late Parliament, when the di-
rectors of the Cambrian kailway Company
were brought to the Bar of the House in
connection with the dismissal of a station-
master who had given unwelcome evidence
before a Select Committee. House in the
ludicrous pickle which invariably follows
on Privilege proceedings. Directors sum-

Dogberry's example in similar circumstances—to
take no note of directors, but let them go and pre-

th God they were rid of the knaves—it would
have been well. But, directors being solemnly

A STUDY IN ETHNOLOGY.
UPon my luck I still reflect,
That led us to the same Museum:
I greeted you with staid respect,
ut my heart sang its own Te Deum,
And blessed your Uncle, ere I wist,
For being an ethnologist!
On old Assyrian spoils intent,
Our very presence he forgot,
ile we o'er strings of wampum bent—
We saw them and we saw them not.
He lived within a past long dead,
We, in the seconds as they sped.
Within a carven mirror old,
Suddenly, as we wandered by,
You looked upon your hair of gold
And flushing face, and so did I.
Then on we passed: a vault we found,
And PHARAoH's coffin, underground.
Oh, if his phantom ever stood
Beside the coffin made for him,
And saw you in your joyous mood,
With your bright eyes and figure slim,
King PHARAQH might have envied us
Beside his old sarcophagus !
But, PHARAoh, we, rememberin
The ancient creed that souls f Inen
MN see the summer and the spring,
ay live again, and love again,
A moment wished the tale were true,
Because—it seemed so hard on you!

YoU regret that all you do
Is to be a lady who
Just walks on—a smile or twe,
Then you're gone;
For you think that any gawk
Would be good enough to walk,
You undoubtedly should talk
When you’re “on.”
You are but a sort of show.
Silence for a girl is slow,
Speech is woman's right, I know
That is true,
And although your pretty face
Charms beholders by its grace,
You would like a higher place,
Wouldn't you ?
But we cannot all have “leads,”
Nicely suited to our needs,
To excel in words and deeds,
So, if you desire to speak,
I am not so far to seek,
I would listen for a week-
Talk to me.

“STRANGE DISAPPEARANCES.”
THE four strangers were gathered together in the all-but-deserted
inn. They were forced to enter into conversation, because, the
solitary periodical taken in by the landlord had been read from title
to imprint by everyone of them.
“A strange article,” said the first, as he laid down the Lancet.
“And so men #. entirely for awhile, and then come back to
their homes and profession as if nothing had hºp. -
“Extraordinary,” murmured the second. “I see that the scien-

of these hurried exits partake of the nature of post-epileptic pheno-
mena.” And then the talk went on, ... The four strangers dined
together, †. together, and on the following morning partook in
company of breakfast. The waiter, at about eleven o'clock, presented
each of them with a note. It came from the landlord, and was full
of figures. A weird look appeared on their faces.
“We must move on,” said one of the quartette; “but as the
staircase is steep, let us descend by the window.” -
The no-longer-perplexed strangers adopted the suggestion, and
ently sliding down a rope, were soon quit of the inn. They walked
together for about a quarter of a e, and then coming to four
cross-roads, scattered. -
“Dear me,” said the landlord of the inn, when he once again found
himself alone... “Their disappearance is most strange. I am inclined
to agree with the Lancet, “that the phenomenon remains striking and
mysterious, interesting in its psychological aspect, but in its cºncrete
form full of practical and medico-legal difficulties;" and, believin
this, I must write to the proper authorities.” And he sat down an

THE sky was darkened by
swart birds, with tufted tails,
and a look in their clay-col-

stifled croaks; the rain fell in
grizzled sheets like the stream-

Titanic lunatic, and the thun-
der boomed over the town as if
it had just discovered another
epoch-making novel.
Night fell; I lit my lamp
and closed the shutters, drew
my curtains, so as to shut out
any gleaming cats' eyes that
mightbepeering at methrough

a tumbler of hot punch.

Q. Then you think such a proceeding patriotic?
4. Not only patriotic, but necessary.
Q. You probably have some recollection

4. Yes; but I have been chiefly influ-
enced by considerations of a mathematical
character.
Q. Make your meaning plainer.
4. I mean that it stands to reason that as
only a small percentage of our people are
trained to arms, and ninety-six per cent. of
our neighbours are converted into soldiers,

would have the upper hand.

4. Precisely; that is entirely myopinion.
Q. And, consequently, you take a serious view of Volunteering?
4; Ashredly, or I would not give up most of my leisure time to
master drill in all its branches.
Q...Do yºu obtain any social advantages by wearing the uniform
if a Wolunteer?

causes considerable expense, and the commission of an officer is in-

A. Because, in the general estimation, the holder of a commission
in the Volunteers is worthy of ridicule, pity, or contempt.
Q. Can you give the reason for this impression? -
4. It is probable that it has been created by the consideration that
a Volunteer officer is chaffed by his friends, sneered at by his enemies,
and mulcted of much money by his comrades.
Q. Then a Volunteer officer or private usually joins the force from
the most patriotic of motives?
A., Certainly. Nine-tenths of the rank and file and their.com-
manding officers wish to qualify as soldiers capable of repelling a
foreign invasion.
Q. And this being so, they do not wish to spend three or four days
of training in practising “marches past” and other manoeuvres of a
more or less ornamental character?
A. Quite so; not even when the practice terminates with a review

THE WOULD-BE SOLDIER'S WADE MECUM.
Question...Why did you become a member of a Volunteer corps?
4nºlder. With theintention of strengthening our national defences.
Q. Then you think such a proceeding patriotic?
A. Not only patriotic, but necessary.
Q. You probably have some recollection
of the French collapse in 1870–71?
4. Yes; but I have been chiefly influ-
enced by considerations of a mathematical
character.
Q. Make your meaning plainer.
* I . that it .*. reason. º as
o a small percentage of our people are
º to arms, and #: ; per cent. of
our neighbours are converted into soldiers,
the latter, in the case of a quarrel with us,
would have the upper hand.
Q: And you a quarrel entailing the
arbitration of the sword might be sprung
- upon us at any moment?
4. Precisely; that is entirely my opinion.
Q. And, consequently, you take a serious view of Volunteering F
4. Assuredly, or I would not give up most of my leisure time to
master drill in all its branches.
Q. Do you obtain any social advantages by wearing the uniform
of a Wolunteer?
4. Noi ºn the contrary, the, grade of a private in the long run
causes considerable expense, and the commission of an officer is in-
Q. Why is the holding of a commission of a Volunteer officer
“inseparable from a loss of self-respect”?
A. Because, in the general estimation, the holder of a commission
in the Volunteers is worthy of ridicule, pity, or contempt.
Q. Can you give the reason for this impression ?
4. It is probable that it has been created by the consideration that
a Volunteer officer is chaffed by his friends, sneered at by his enemies,
and mulcted of much money by his comrades. -
Q. Then a Volunteer officer or private usually joins the force from
the most patriotic of motives?
A., Certainly. Nine-tenths of the rank and file and their.com-
manding officers wish to qualify as soldiers capable of repelling a
foreign invasion.
Q. And this being so, they do not wish to spend three or four days
of training in practising “marches past” and other manoeuvres of a
more or less ornamental character?
A. Quite so; not even when the practice terminates with a review

Q. Nor do the Volunteers desire to be made into a raree show?
4. Not even to make a cockney Bank Holiday.
Q. And if you are told that this is the sort of thing that the
Volunteers want, what do you reply?
A. Nonsense.
Q. And if it were added that more serious work would be un-
popular, what would be your suggestion?
A. Try and see.

I.—THE EXPRESS TRAIN.
A GRUESOME tale I tell of the

“Its virtues few, its faults a score”—
(I quote the view held heretofore).
The chief among its faults, you see,
Is sad unpunctualitee.
Now, gentles all, list what befel
AUGUSTUS HALL, of Camberwell.
The Fates were stern, the world unkind;
And this, I learn, unhingeåhis mind.

His evil star it drove him mad!
“If life has no more joy to give,”
Quoth he, “I’ll go and cease to live.
Nor yet delay an hour to dine,
But straightway lay me on the line.
“The train now due will end distress—
So haste thee, Two o'clock Express!”
With that he’d gone, nor stayed to snack;
But climbed upon the railway-track.
He waited now two hours—not less;
And #. I vow, came no express!
And he had nought his pangs to ease.
He wished he’ #: some bread and
cheese.
He had to fast. He fain would sup.
The hours flew past. He sate him up.
“'Tis strangely late. I should not mind—
'd gladly wait—if I had dined.
“If I’d a joint that I could carve,
I’d strain a point; but here to starve!!

Such gross unpunctualitee!
“No gentleman can now depend
On any plan to plan his end.”
Twelve hours or more he waited thus.
“A train?” he swore; “an omnibus /
“It tarries yet all through the might,
And helps to whet my appetite!”
His hunger grew inside his chest;
With nought to chew, he was—non est.
Two days pass by, and then we find
The train draw º three days behind!
Directors sigh, deplore, and frown;
And fine the driver half-a-crown.

OH, painters, you who always “come

Atrocious smell of paint, and make
The streets in such a shocking state, you
Are quite a nuisance—how I hate you!

Your paint may tumble on my back,
Or I may smash, which might be sadder,

How can the §: ight my mind,
How can I like the budding trees,
The butterflies of any kind?

In any way the mental man,
Were I a painted gentleman.

With visions of impending doom?

CARMENCITA.
(An Impression.)
“O EAST is east, and west is west
And never the twain shall meet.”
And the dance of Spain is one of the twain
To the English Man in the Street.
We love the trick of the lofty kick
And the muscular display
Of the nymph who has leapt at a muslin hoop
And stopp'd in her flight half-way. -:
A plain, blunt girl in the stormy swirl
faccordion pleats and laces, --
Tho' she cannot dance, if she spin and prance,
Is numbered among the Graces.
For heel and toe our hearts can glow
And the feats of the rhythmic clog,
And a poem of motion wells forth in the notion
Of a Serpentine Dancing Dog.
But the dancer's art, of her life a part,
A song of the wordless soul
With a tale to tell, like the music's swell,
Too large for the word's control,
That goes not down in London town
Where dogg'd conventions stick,
And dancers still must charm with frill,
Or “make shymnastic drick.”
As the jungle king with his wrathful spring,
To the lamb that aptly bleats,
As the trumpet's blare to the palsied air
Of that which plays in pleats,
So is east to west, with its sun-born zest,
With fire at the quick heart's core,
THE BALLAD OF THE KAISER'S MERCY.
(In brief.)
“The sovereign'st thing on earth

DRAMATIC FAMILY LIKENEss.
For the plot of . The Passport,
recently produced with a fair amount
of success at Terry's Theatre, the
authors admit their indebtedness to
Colonel SAVAGE's novel, My Official
Wife. Oddly enough, this plot
bears a considerable resemblance to
that of The Orient Express, a piece
“made in Germany,” of which the
English adaptation was produced
here, at Daly's, during his season.
In this piece, i.e., The Orient
Express, a gentleman has tourist
tickets for himself and wife; but
his wife, after disposing of her
ticket to a professional cicérone,
returns to England alone, while her
husband, travelling on business, con-
tinues his journey. The cicérone
has sold the ticket cheap to a lady,
who is therefore compe to travel
under the name inscribed on the
ticket, and finds herself in the
same carriage with the gentleman
who has the corresponding ticket,
and the ticket-collector, seeing the
same names, hands back both tickets
to the gentleman, and tries to keep
the carriage strictly reserved for
them all the way, in which attempt
he fails, and hence arise, on their
return to England, complications
analogous to those of The Passport.

(From the Diary of a Pleasure-seeker of the Future.)
Rose early, intending to have a real good time of it, in spite of
the recent disturbances. As a precautionary measure, wore my
bullet-proof coat and shell-defying boots. Carried also my armour-
plated umbrella, which can be used (on emergencies) as a shield to
quick-firing guns. Looked out of window, and found the weather
splendid. Firing, too (which I had heard every now and again
during the j. seemingly all but ceased.
On reaching the street, representative of the Civil Power cautioned
me to be careful. Thanked the representative for his courtesy, and
asked why a squadron of hussars were trotting past, with drawn
sabres. as told that the soldiers were engaged in the protection
of a sweep ºf to his work in a donkey-cart.
Started for a stroll, but had to seek shelter in a doorway from a
volley of bullets fired in the direction of the early milkman. From
this demonstration I gathered that the food supply would be still
further restricted owing to the action of the men on strike. After
the purveyor had beaten a hasty retreat, advanced upon a .
fortified position, which turned out to be, as I expected it would, a
doubly-entrenched cab-stand.
Only one vehicle on the rank: Engaged the cabman. Although I
was unaccompanied by a relative or friend, found the space at my
disposal distinctly limited. The top of the four-wheeler was, of
course, occupied by the customary rocket party. The box had its
ul sentry, carrying a couple of revolvers and a search-light.
Three of the seats inside were occupied by sharpshooters, and I
retained the fourth.
“We had better make for the river,” said the officer in command,
and we fell in with the suggestion,
Our progress was comparatively uneventful. Gertainly; at the
corners of streets we had to run the gauntlet of a shower of projectiles
of various dimensions; still, the armour-plated sides of the cab
turned aside the flood of iron, and the custodians, by lying flat as
occasion required, escaped without injury. Leaving the steel-pro-
tected cab, } embarked on board an armouredt;. steamboat, and
made my way down the river. Fortunately, the helmsman was able
to avoid the submarine mines which had been laid by the Chairman
of the Strike Committee. Our voyage was also rendered exciting by
the torpedoes.
Having reached the last pier, I returned to land, and was suffi-
ciently fortunate to catch an omnibus about to start on its exciting
campaign. The route, which ran chiefly through main thorougfares
extended to the length of four miles. Thanks to the exertions of aii
arms of the service, the distance was traversed in about three hours.
Every inch of the ground was hotly contested, but the omnibus at
length won the day. The losses on our side consisted of a colonel
# and seventy-four rank-and-file wounded. The casualties on
the side of the jº were infinitely more numerous.
On .# : destination, I made for home in a balloon, thus
escaping any further molestation.

(From the Diary of a Pleasure-seeker of the Future.)
Rose early, intending to have a real good time of it, in spite of
the recent disturbances. As a precautionary measure, wore my
bullet-proof coat and shell-defying boots. Carried also my armour-
plated umbrella, which can be used (on emergencies) as a shield to
quick-firing guns. Looked out of window, and found the weather
splendid. Firing, too (which I had heard every now and again
during the night), seemingly all but ceased.
On reaching the street, representative of the Civil Power cautioned
me to be careful. Thanked the representative for his courtesy, and
asked why a squadron of hussars were trotting past with drawn
sabres. as told that the soldiers were engaged in the protection
of a sweep jº. ing to his work in a donkey-cart.
Started for a stroll, but had to seek shelter in a doorway from a
volley of bullets fired in the direction of the early milkman. From
this demonstration I gathered that the foodžsupply would be still
further restricted owing to the action of the men on strike. After
the purveyor had beaten a hasty retreat, advanced upon a .
fortified position, which turned out to be, as I expected it would, a
doubly-entrenched cab-stand.
Only one vehicle on the rank, Engaged the cabman. Although I
was unaccompanied by a relative or friend, found the space at my
disposal distinctly limited. The top of the four-wheeler was, of
course, occupied by the customary rocket party. The box had its
usual sentry, carrying a couple of revolvers and a search-light.
Three of the seats inside were occupied by sharpshooters, and I
retained the fourth.
“We had better make for the river,” said the officer in command,

DRAMATIC FAMILY LIKENEss.
For the plot of The Passport,
recently produced with a fair amount
of success at Terry's Theatre, the
authors admit their indebtedness to
Colonel SAVAGE's novel, My Official
Wife. Oddly enough, this plot
bears a considerable resemblance to
that of The Orient Express, a piece
“made in Germany,” of which the
English adaptation was produced
here, at Daly's, during his season.
this piece, i.e., The Orient
Express, a gentleman has tourist
tickets for himself and wife; but
his wife, after disposing of her
ticket to a professional cicérone,
returns to England alone, while her
husband, travelling on business, con-
tinues his journey. The cicérone
has sold the ticket cheap to a lady,
who is therefore compelled to travel
under the name inscribed on the
ticket, and finds herself in the
same carriage with the gentleman
who has the corresponding ticket,
and the ticket-collector, seeing the
same names, hands back both tickets
to the gentleman, and tries to keep
the carriage strictly reserved for
them all the way, in which attempt
he fails, and hence arise, on their
return to England, complications
analogous to those of The Passport.
Was the novel of My Official %
written before the German farcical
play, or is it only a family like-

occasion required, escaped without injury. Leaving the steel-pro-
tected cab, } embarked on board an armoured penny steamboat, and
made my way down the river. Fortunately, the helmsman was able
to avoid the submarine mines which had been laid by the Chairman
of the Strike Committee. Our voyage was also rendered exciting by
the torpedoes.
Having reached the last pier, I returned to land, and was suffi-
ciently fortunate to catch an omnibus about to start on its exciting
campaign. The route, which ran chiefly through main thorougfares
extended to the length of four miles. Thanks to the exertions of aii
arms of the service, the distance was traversed in about three hours.
Every inch of the ground was hotly contested, but the omnibus at
i: won the day. The losses on our side consisted of a colonel
killed. and seventy-four rank-and-file wounded. The casualties on
the side of the strikers were infinitely more numerous.
On reaching : destination, I made for home in a balloon, thus
escaping any further molestation.
PRESENTED AT COURT.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I notice that “an original dramatic cari-
cature” is being played at the Court Theatre, under the title of
Vanity Fair. To prevent mistakes, I write to say at once that I am
on the eve of constructing a three-volume novel, called Hamlet, Prince
of Denmark; a poem, called Boz and Cor; and a satire, called
acaulay’s History of England. I merely mention this fact to
rotect my copyright in the names I have chosen for my new works,
f have also in contemplation the writing of a book to be entitled
Adam Bede, a novelette, to be known as King Solomon's Mines,
and a story to be y'clept Treasure Island. May I add that I have
also some pantomimes and eccentric ballets nearly ready that will be
christened, when completed,—Esmond, The Virginians, The New-
ones, Filip, and last, but not least, Pendennis.
- Yours truly, NoTHING IFNOT ORIGINAL.
P,S.—I am thinking of adopting as a nom de plume the signature
of “WILLIAM MAKEFEack THACKERAY.”

No, but it is a hair-lifter, in three acts.

lve,
Q. Kindly resolve this º:
A. All are objectionable that
stage, and one that doesn't.
Q...You speak of the stage; where has the
play been given P
A. Nowhere. It has not received a license.
Q. Is it the close season P
4. No, but so much private license was
taken by the Author-publisher that the public
censor did not see his way to adding to the
amount. ---
Q. Then we shall not see it interpreted by
intelligent actors? ... .
A. No, for even if license were granted,
the Author-publisher would take all the
parts himself.
Q. I do not follow this scheme of plurality.
. A. I quote from his own printed adver-
tisement, “The right of performing in public
this play (sic) is reserved by the author.”
Q: Did you state that it is a tragedy? .

Q. Does it move thereader to pity and terror?
A. Yes, both. Pity for himself, and terror
of the next thing of the kind that he may
have to read. - ---
Q. Has it any other of the high qualities
of the Greek Tragedy?
A. It says it has the unities.
Q. A severe attack?
A. No, the Norwegian kind; a form of
Teutonic measles, painful but transitory.
Q. Is it heroic *
A. No, but it is suburban.
Q. Is the conclusion worthy of a great
tragedy? - Does it end in a lurid light of
whole-souled passion and death?
A. It ends about 4 A.M. the next day,
with a cock crowing. The protagonist has
come home intoxicated, and remains so.
I regret to add that he pushes the heroine,
she having displaced his beverage by break
. the glass. She slaps him upon the face,
and eventually loses animation. I do not
know how the other two end, because they
were not home in time for the curtain. As
it was, the Author-publisher nearly spoilt
for them.
All must be well that ends so well.
Is there a problem or enigma P
A. There is always the insoluble riddle-
why did he write it
. Is it full of situations?
A. Not inconveniently so; but there is a
dramatic moment.
Q. Which P
A. I do not know.
Q. Then why do you say there is one?
A. Because the Author-publisher says so.
Q. But is it not wasteful to have three
acts, and only one dramatic moment?
A. I should have thought so; but the
Author-publisher says he has shown economy.
Q. Could you give meanidea of themanner?
Select a striking incident or a passage where
there is subtle characterisation.
A. One situation impressed me very much.
I think it must have been the atic
moment. I reserve it for my next.

MAY I. THE SWEEPS' FESTIVAL.
A STUDY IN BLAck AND WHITE. *.* Nice For NExt FARE.
REMARKABLE INSTANCE OF SAGACITY IN GROUSE.
To The Field of April 20, Mr. FREDERICK MILBANK wrote about
the “Monument to a Grouse Shooter” on Wimmergill Moor. Mr.
|MILBANK considered the number of grouse he had bagged as con-
łstituting a “record,” and so caused a monument to be erected on the
spot sacred to the memory of four thousand brace of grouse shot
in six days by five guns with one extra gun on the sixth day.
The monument, being erected, scared the grouse away. Of course
they read the sad story, held a council, and decided that as lon
as F. A. MILBANK was anywhere about, within shot, they woul
preserve themselves by avoiding him, Subsequently the monument
was removed to Bamingham in North Yorkshire. But the North
Yorkshire birds are quite indifferent to this tale from The Hills.
They wink the other eye, that is until such time as FREDERICK A.
MILBANK shall show them the sort of gun he is, and then they’ll be
sorry for not having taken warning earlier, unless they the
Jingle's dog, who read the inscription on the board, “ Gamekeeper has
orders to shoot all dogs found in this inclosure,” and “wouldn't
it.” “Singular circumstance that,” said Mr. Pickwick. “Will
you allow me to make a note of it?”
THE MODERN BUYER :
GRowls of MoDERN “MASTERs.”
Royal Academy, Burlington House, May 3, 1895.
THE “Old Masters” over, the New make a start.
Another year’s past and another year's come;
And Fame blows a blast on her trumpet, and Art
Beats her drum!
“Walk Up!!” An º: is set by the Court;
And Society hastens—a feverish throng;
A mere glance at the pictures, for life is but short-
And Art's long l
Three artists looked on with a cynical smile-
One needy Outsider, and two rich R.A.'s
(Both walking on velvet, because of the pile
. They could raise).
They discussed the “Art Patron”—in all of that crowd
An avis that's rara and rara each year.
And these are the words that they spoke, and allowed
Me to hear:—
First R.A.
“Now, to none do I yield in my love of WANDyck–
I adore the Italians—bow down to the Dutch;
WELAsquez I worship, and Goya I like
%. much.
“But alas! for the SHEEPshanks and WERNoNs of old-
For the HILLs and the rest of a connoisseur race!
Old MECAENAs has §: and investors of gold
ake his place.”
Second R.A.
“‘Old Masters’ they ..º. ancient design-
Eighteen-thirty or so is the latest they’ll own;
None but “made reputations’—no work, howe'er fine,
If unknown.”
Outsider.
“Their Art’s in their bankers'-books, not in their eyes
To encourage the artist is none of their plan;
They seek an investment that's likely to rise-
To a man.
“Do they think that fine art nowhere else can be seen
But in saint that is squint-eyed, or boor that is drunk,
In brown tree, Dutch canal, man with ruff, or the lean
Spanish monk?”
Second R.A.
“Just reflect to what artists of old had been brought
(Such as REYNoLDs, or RAPHAEL, or PHIDLAs the Greek)
Had their patrons informed them they meant to buy nought
But antique!”
Outsider.
“Then, our drawing is better—our atmosphere too.
Plein air was ignored, or they voted it vice.
As to “values,’’twas little they thought of or knew—
Save of price.”
First R.A.
“When men buy modern art, they buy Leightons and Moores
And Sargents and Swans and the rest of our lot;
But as to §. knowledge—like mine or like yours–
Tommy rot!”
Second R.A.
“Do you think they appreciate LEwis's skies—
Do they care if they’re worked up in stipple or wash?
Do you #. it’s the Art (not the money) they prize?
Simply bosh!”
Outsider.
“No. They judge not by Art—they judge º fame;
And the artist may starve on his H. allet-bed;
But their hundreds and thousands they shower on his name
When he's dead!—
“When the two Greatest Masters—Old Warnish and Time–
To his work superficial beauties have lent,
Lo behold, they appreciate! Be it so. I’m

sagacity of the grouse of Wimmergill, which resembles that of Mr.
Quite content.”

A FRIEND AT A PINCH.
(An Utterly Impossible Incident that will merer be “Reported.”)
SCENE-A Court of Law. Experienced Counsel arguing
a point in the teeth of his Lordship on the Bench.
His Lordship (angrily). No, Mr. BANDs, I really cannot
agree with you. It seems to me that you are merely |
wasting our time, and no doubt your own.
Experienced Counsel (politely). Not at all, my Lord.
I scarcely venture to urge the great importance of the
matter to my client. -
His Lordship. No doubt; and, your client showed
excellent iº in entrusting his interests to your
hands. Still law is law, and can never be anything else.
Exp. C. Your Lordship is most kind. But my point,
my Lord, is so plain—the matter is so clear. Surely your
Lordship must see it.
His Lordship (with much irony). It is my fault, no
doubt, Mr. BANDs, but as matter of fact your point is
absolutely lost to me. I confess I cannot see it at all.
Erp. C. I would not propose for a moment that your
Lordship's judgment is at fault. But I would venture to
suggest that the atmosphere of the Court is sufficiently
dense to cloud the clearest and most brilliant intellect;
His Lordship (mollified). There is a good deal in what
you say, Mr. BANDs, but of course, we must put up with
it. There is no remedy.
Erp. C. With every possible respect to the Bench, my
Lord, I would humbly suggest that there is a remedy.
His Lordship. Can you quote a case? . .
Exp. C. I can, at any rate, refer to an opinion.
His Lordship. Has it been reported?. -
Exp. C. Certainly, my Lord. You will find it in the
Reports of the Hardwicke Society. , Lord Chief Justice
Russell of KILLowRN has laid it down that snuff is a
most valuable assistance to the proper, dispensation of
justice. . His Lordship has declared that the inhaling of
prepared tobacco through the nostrils “clears the judi-
cial brain, predisposes it to calmness and impartiality,
and enables a learned judge to listen with patience to the
most fluent and prolific of forensic orators.” . If your
Lordship pleases. Offers snuff-bor to the Judge,
His Lordship (after taking a pinch). Well, certainl
the point you have raised seems clearer to me than it did.
(After a few moments of consideration.)...I will reserve
the case for further consideration, and will deliver judg-
ment later. -
Erp. C. As your Lordship pleases. I will ask the
usher to hand my authorities to your Lordship.
His Lordship (receiving, snuff-box). You are very
good. I will not overlook their assistance in coming to a
conclusion. I hope the occasion may never arise when I
might be compelled, as the vulgar tongue expresses it, to
“give you snuff.” [Scene closes upon mutual courtesies.

CHARIVARI.
SARK tells me that, on going into Com-
mittee of º: , he intends to move that
henceforward the gallery over the Clock
facing the Chair shall be called “The
Speaker's Gullery.” SARK always thinks
of the right thing at the right time.
Business done.—New Speaker installed.
Tuesday.—The Order by which Minis-
ters took Tuesdays having lapsed, private
Members to-night came into their own

greedy Governments on their small posses-
sions. Might reasonably be , supposed

would have made most of it. Lots of
things to do to-night. Several resolutions
on paper, with Orders of Day to follow.
What happened was that by a quarter to
nine enthusiasm finally evaporated; count
called; only thirty-seven Members re-
sponded; !. forthwith put out.
Opening debate on Charity Commission
certainly a little heavy. Every Member
who got his chance felt it incumbent on
him to speak for at least half an hour.
Some considerably exceeded this limit.
“Parturiunt montes,” said HERBERT
MAxwell, wearily looking round as
GRIFFITH - BoscAwrN followed John
ELLIS and JESSR CoILINGs succeeded
FRANCIs STEVENson; “nascitur ridiculus
mus.”
And so it was. Particular mountain
at work when the mouse appeared was

behind SPEAKER's Chair; leisurely pro-
ceeded along passage between Front Oppo-
sition Bench and table at which J. W. was

alted by PRINCE ARTHUR's empty seat;
nibbled fibre of º; in remonstrance at his absence; passed
round fearlessly by J. W.'s heels; sat for moment in full view of
House listening attentively to J. W.’s argument; yawned and
sauntered back the wav it came. Interestin debate º keener
than that of average Member. As soon as ACLAND's voice rever-
berated through almost empty Chamber, mouse observed strolling
back along familiar way; took its seat on floor under shadow of Mace
in defiance of all Parliamentary rule; followed ACLAND's argument
with evidently keen interest. Interrupted by approach of Richard
TEMPLE. Quickly looking up and º: sight of his stately figure
bowing to SPEAKER, mouse fled like the wind, in its terror making off
by Treasury Bench, finally escaping by another exit.
“Cogitato,” said HERBERT MAxwell, who breakfasts every
morning off a plate of porridge and a page of PLAUTUS,-
“Cogitato, mus pusillus quam sit sapiens bestia,
AEtatem qui uni cubili nunquam committit suam.”
Business done.—Pension of £4,000 a year voted to ABTHUR
WELLESLEY PEEL, late Speaker.
Fancy Picture of Sir Thomas Esmonde bringing forward
Queen “Lily o' Killarney” Hawaii.
Thursday.—All very well for gay young
Irish baronet like Esmon DE to champion
cause of errant Queens throned in summer
seas. Expected other things from THE
MACGREGoR. House quite shocked when
he interposed just now. ESMONDE asked
Edward GREY whether Government could
do anything to obtain propertreatment for
Queen of Hawaii. Before Under Secre-
tary could reply, THE MACGREGOR, sud-
denly leaping across dyke as it were, in-
terposed. “As I happen to know the º:
who was formerly Queen of Hawaii,” sai
THE MACGREgor, and so §: to
back up EsmonDE's plea. Offhand way
in which reference was made suggested
illimitable possibilities, THE MAcGREGoR
just “happened to know’ this Queen,
probably one of a bevy. On some quiet
night House might hope to hear paper
read by THE MACGREGoR on “Queens I
Have Known.”
SARK curiously anxious as to where the
acquaintance was made, and how it was
nurtured. Did THE MAcGREgoR vacci-
nate Her Majesty whilst he, still in public
capacity, sojourned at Penrith ?, Was she
an inmate of Peebles Hydropathic Insti-
tute what time he was resident physicianº
or did he minister to her at the Barnhill
Hospital and Asylum, Glasgow, of which,
before he took to Imperial politics, he was
superintendent? Pleasanter still to think
of THE MAcGREgoR and the Queen with
the musical name wandering hand in hand
amid the orange groves of sea- Hawaii,
breakfasting on the bountiful bread-fruit,
lunching off the succulent yam. Did he
in those days call her so much as LIIIUQ-
KALANI? or did he venture on the dimi-
nutive LILI ? SARK, had better give
notice of these questions. Business done.—Fresh Ministerial Bills
brought in with both hands.
Friday.—AnotherT." Members' night, and, by consequence,
another count out. Things kept going till a quarter to eight, but
º; utmost difficulty. Members consented to stay in prospect
of division on ALBERT Rollit's motion º against exemp-
tion of Government property from rating. But they would not longer
linger. When Lubbock followed, with proposal of pleasant chat
about London's share of imperial contribution to local purposes; the
few remaining Members, vainly trving to look as if they’ “back
in ten minutes,” walked out. House counted; only twenty-five
present, and so home to dinner. -
“Yes, yes,” said WALTER Long, left in charge of Front Opposi-
tion Bench, “but this won't prevent us on Monday, when SQUIRE OF
MALwood proposes to take Tuesday and Friday mornings for public
business, stubbornly resisting piratical incursion on the rights of
private Members. Whatever we are, let us be logical.”
Business done.—Ministerial defeaton Rollit's amendment averted
by majority of one.
THE BATTLE OF EASTBOURNE.
Natis in usum laetitiae rosis
Pugnare Eastbourni est.
HoRAce (slightly emended).
It is not the English nature, but the English climate that makes
us take our pleasures sadly (if we do, which we don't). And it is not
the fault of the English nature, but of the organisers, if our public
eants are usually, like our statues, more or less -humoured
urlesques of what they are meant to represent. , Now Eastbourne has
triumphantly shown that, in spite of chilling and heavy rain, England
can rival the sunny South in the beauty and variety of a big pro-
cession of floral cars. And if Eastbourne can do this, why can it not
be done elsewhere? “Organise, organise, organise,” and, let the
hireling merrymaker be conspicuously absent. Your hireling will
still wear his armour as if he were bearing the spolia opima of a
burgled marine-store dealer. And the lady hireling, as a sea-nymph
or a shepherdess, can never quite forget what she owes to her dignity
as a respectable married woman. In the interests of the family ex-
chequer, and in the way of business, she may consent to dally with
allegory, but her heart, is not in the mermaid's grot, nor do the
spacious times of Great ELIZABETH inspire her, beyond the Victorian
circus-smile, the circus-smile which puts a girdle round about, the
coach, carriage, wheel-barrow or cart, in a way which speaks
volumes for the artistic sense of the South Saxons. The children, as
children use, took the cake—after Mr. EDGAR BRUCE. They were:
there in great numbers and variety, from the little Titania in her
fairy goat-chaise, o'er canopied with flowers and flying doves, to the
very small skipper of the very realistic ship, who s on the rainy
deck with drawn sword and unswerving dignity for some two hours
of constant and crowded parading. “Bravo, BURNABY,” is the re-
sultant cry of gratified spectators, and better weather next time. A
better show it would be ungrateful to suggest.

First Man. Of course you say that as you’ve got those shares in
that Distillery Company.
Second Man. Well, you needn't talk, with your ALLsoPP
Debentures.
First Man. Come to that, personally I take no interest in beer.
It's poison to me.
Second Man. It's the finest drink in the world. I never touch
spirits.
First Man. They're much more wholesome. I wonder what the
Government will do about Local Veto and Compensation. I suppose,

It is not the English nature, but the English climate that makes

the fault of the English nature, but of the organisers, if our public
eants are usually, like our statues, more or less -humoured
urlesques of what they are meant to represent. , Now Eastbourne has
triumphantly shown that, in spite of chilling and heavy rain, England
can rival the sunny South in the beauty and variety of a big pro-
cession of floral cars. And if Eastbourne can do this, why can it not
be done elsewhere? “Organise, organise, organise,” and let the
hireling merrymaker be conspicuously absent. Your hireling will
still wear his armour as if he were bearing the spolia opima of a
burgled marine-store dealer. And the lady hireling, as a sea-nymph
or a shepherdess, can never quite forget what she owes to her dignity
as a respectable married woman. In the interests of the family ex-
chequer, and in the way of business, she may consent to dally with
allegory, but her heart, is not in the mermaid's grot, nor do the

of the right thing at the right time.

would have made most of it. Lots of
things to do to-night. Several resolutions
on paper, with Orders of Day to follow.
What happened was that by a quarter to
nine enthusiasm finally evaporated; count
called; only thirty-seven Members re-
sponded; lights forthwith put out.
Opening debate on Charity Commission
certainly a little heavy. Every Member
who got his chance felt it incumbent on
him to speak for at least half an hour.
Some considerably exceeded this limit.
“Parturiunt montes,” said HERBERT
MAxwell, wearily looking round as
GRIFFITH - BoscAwen followed John
ELLIS and JESSE Collings succeeded
FRANCIS STEVENson; “nascitur ridiculus
mus.”
And so it was. Particular mountain
at work when the mouse appeared was
J. W. LowTHER. Mouse entered from
behind SPEAKER's Chair; leisurely pro-
ceeded along passage between Front Oppo-
sition Bench and table at which J. W. was
tºº.º.º.
alted by PRINGEARTHUR's empty seat;
nibbled fibre of matting in remonstrance at his absence; passed
round fearlessly by J. W.'s heels; sat for moment in full view of
House listening attentively to J. W.’s argument; yawned and
sauntered back the way it came. Interestin debate evidently keener
than that of average Member. As soon as ACLAND's voice rever-
berated through almost empty Chamber, mouse observed strolling
back along familiar way; took its seat on floor under shadow of Mace
in defiance of all Parliamentary rule; followed ACLAND's argument
with evidently keen interest. Interrupted by approach of Richard
TEMPLE, Quickly looking up and catching sight of his stately figure
bowing to SPEAKER, mouse fled like the wind, in its terror making off
by Treasury Bench, finally escaping by another exit.
“Cogitato,” said HERBERT Maxwell, who breakfasts every
morning off a plate of porridge and a page of PLAUTUs,
“Cogitato, mus pusillus quam sit sapiens bestia,
AEtatem qui uni cubili nunquam committit suam.”
Business done.—Pension of £4,000 a year voted to ARTHUR
WELLESLEY PEEL, late Speaker.
Fancy Picture of Sir Thomas Esmonde bringing forward
Queen “Lily o' Killarney” Hawaii.
Thursday.--All very well for gay young
Irish baronet like EsmonDE to champion
--- cause of errant Queens throned in summer
- seas. Expected other things from THE
MACGREGoR. House quite shocked when
he interposed just now. ESMONDE asked
º Edward GREY whether Government could
do anything to obtain propertreatment for
Queen of Hawaii. Before Under Secre-
tary could reply, THE MACGREGOR, sud-
denly leaping across dyke as it were, in-
terposed. “As I happen to know the º
who was formerly Queen of Hawaii,” sai
THE MACGREgor, and 'so roceeded to
back up Esmon DE's plea. Offhand way
in which reference was made sugg
illimitable possibilities, THE MACGREGOR
just “happened to know’ this Queen,
probably one of a bevy. On some quiet
night House might hope to hear paper
read by THE MACGREGoR on “Queens I
Have Known.”
SARK curiously anxious as to where the
acquaintance was made, and how it was
nurtured... Did THE MAcGREgoR vacci-
nate Her Majesty whilst he, still in public
capacity, sojourned at Penrith ?, Was she
an inmate of Peebles Hydropathic Insti-
tute what time he was resident physicianº
or did he minister to her at the Barnhill
Hospital and Asylum, Glasgow, of which,
before he took to Imperial politics, he was
superintendent? Pleasanter still to think
of THE MAcGREGoR and the Queen with
the musical name wandering hand in hand
amid the orange groves of #. Hawaii,
breakfasting on the bountiful bread-fruit,
lunching off the succulent yam. Did he
in those days call her so much as LILIUQ-
KALANI? or did he venture on the dimi-
nutive LILIP SARK, had better give
notice of these questions. Business done.—Fresh Ministerial Bills
brought in with both hands. -
Friday.—Another_private Members' night, and, by consequence,
another count out. Things kept going till a quarter to eight, but
º, utmost difficulty. Members consented to stay in prospect
of division on ALBERT Rollit's motion protesting against exemp-
tion of Government property from rating. But they would not longer
linger. When LUBBock, followed, with proposal of pleasant chat
about London's share of imperial contribution to local purposes, the
few remaining Members, vainly trving to look as if they’d be “back
in ten minutes,” walked out. House counted; only twenty-five
present, and so home to dinner. -
“Yes, yes,” said WALTER LoNg, left in charge of Front Opposi-
tion Bench, “but this won't prevent us on Monday, when SQUIRE OF
MALwood proposes to take Tuesday and Friday mornings for public
business, stubbornly resisting piratical incursion on the rights of
private Members. Whatever we are, let us be logical.”
Business done.—Ministerial defeat on Rollit's amendment averted
by majority of one.

THE BATTLE OF EASTBOURNE.

HoRAce (slightly emended).
It is not the English nature, but the English climate that makes
us take our pleasures sadly (if we do, which we don't). And it is not
the fault of the English nature, but of the organisers, if our public
eants are usually, like our statues, more or less -humoured
urlesques of what they are meant to represent. , Now Eastbourne has
triumphantly shown that, in spite of chilling and heavy rain, England
can rival the sunny South in the beauty and variety of a big pro-
cession of floral cars. And if Eastbourne can do this, why can it not
be done elsewhere? “Organise, º: organise,” and let the
hireling merrymaker be conspicuously absent. Your hireling will
still wear his armour as if he were bearing the spolia opima of a
burgled marine-store dealer. And the lady hireling, as a sea-nymph
or a shepherdess, can never quite forget what she owes to her dignity
as a respectable married woman. In the interests of the family ex-
chequer, and in the way of business, she may consent to dally with
allegory, but her heart is not in the mermaid's grot, nor do the
spacious times of Great ELIZABETH inspire her, beyond the Victorian
circus-smile, the circus-smile which puts a girdle round about, the
face for forty minutes, or more if the procession be so long a-field.

CHARIVARI. [May 4, 1895.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
SARK tells me that, on going into Com-
mittee of Su º: he intends to move that
henceforward, the gallery over the Clock
facing the Chair shall be called “The
Speaker's Gullery.” SARK always thinks
of the right thing at the right time.
Business done.—New Speaker installed.
Tuesday.—The Order by which Minis-
ters took Tuesdays having lapsed, private
Members to-night came into their own
again. Always stoutly resist incursion of
greedy Governments on their small posses-
sions., Might reasonably be , supposed
that, having come into their inheritance.
would have made most of it. Lots of
things to do to-night. Several resolutions
on paper, with Orders of Day to follow.
What happened was that by a quarter to
nine enthusiasm finally evaporated; count *A.
called; only thirty-seven Members re- % º
sponded; lights forthwith put out. º
Opening debate on Charity Commission
certainly a little heavy. Every Member
who got his chance felt it incumbent on
him to speak for at least half an hour.
Some considerably exceeded this limit.
“Parturiunt montes,” said HERBERT
MAxweLL, wearily looking round as
GRIFFITH - BoscAweN followed John
ELLIS and JESSR Collings succeeded
FRANCIS STEVENsoN; “nascitur ridiculus
mus.”
And so it was. Particular mountain
at work when the mouse appeared was
J. W. LowTHER. Mouse entered from
behind SPEAKER's Chair; leisurely pro-
ceeded along passage between Front Oppo-
sition Bench and table at which J. W. was
#. disrespectfully of JEsseCoLLINGs.
alted by PRINCE ARTHUR's empty seat;
nibbled fibre of matting in remonstrance at his absence; passed
round fearlessly by J. W.'s heels; sat for moment in full view of
House listening attentively to J. W.’s argument; yawned and
sauntered back the way it came. Interestin debate evidently keener
than that of average Member. As soon as ACLAND's voice rever-
berated through almost empty Chamber, mouse observed strolling
back along familiar way; took its seat on floor under shadow of Mace
in defiance of all Parliamentary rule; followed ACLAND's argument
with evidently keen interest. Interrupted by approach of Richard
TEMPLE, Quickly looking up and catching sight of his stately figure
bowing to SPEAKER, mouse fled like the wind, in its terror making off
by Treasury Bench, finally escaping by another exit.
“Cogitato,” said HERBERT MAxwrLL, who breakfasts every
morning off a plate of porridge and a page of PLAUTUs,
“Cogitato, mus pusillus quam sit sapiens bestia,
AFtatem qui uni cubili nunquam committit suam.”
Business done.—Pension of £4,000 a year voted to ARTHUR
WELLESLEY PEEL, late Speaker.
Fancy Picture of Sir Thomas Esmonde bringing forward
Queen “Lily o' Killarney” Hawaii.
Thursday.--All very well for gay young
Irish baronet like EsmonDE to champion
cause of errant Queens throned in summer
- Beas.
--- Expected other things from THE
Maggregon, House quite shocked when
º he interpºsed just now, EsmonDE asked
Edward GREY whether Government could
do anything to obtain propertreatment for
Queen of Hawaii. Before Under Secre-
tary could reply, THE MACGREGOR, sud-
denly leaping across dyke as it were, in-
terposed. “As I happen to know the º
who was formerly Queen of Hawaii,” sai
THE MACGREgor, and so § ed to
back up Esmon DE's plea. Offhand way
in which reference was made sugg
illimitable possibilities, THE MACGREGoR
just “happened to know’ this Queen,
probably one of a bevy. On some quiet
night House might hope to hear paper
read by THE MACGREGoR on “Queens I
" Have Known.”
SARK curiously anxious as to where the
acquaintance was made, and how it was
nurtured. Did THE MacGregon vacci-
nate Her Majesty whilst he, still in public
capacity, sojourned at Penrith ?, Was she
an inmate of Peebles Hydropathic Insti-
tute what time he was resident physician P
or did he minister to her at the Barnhill
Hospital and Asylum, Glasgow, of which,
before he took to Imperial politics, he was
superintendent? Pleasanter still to think
of THE MACGREGOR and the Queen with
the musical name wandering hand in han
amid the orange groves of sea-girt Hawaii,
breakfasting on the bountiful bread-fruit,
lunching off the succulent yam. Did he
in those days call her so much as LILIUQ-
KALANI? or did he venture on the dimi-
- nutive LILIP SARK, had better give
notice of these questions. Business done.—Fresh Ministerial Bills
brought in with both hands.
Friday.—Another private Members' -
another count out. ings kept going a quarter to eight, but
º; utmost difficulty. Members consented to stay in prospect
of division on ALBERT Roll. It's motion protesting against exemp-
tion of Government property from rating. But they would not longer
linger. When LUBBock followed, with proposal of pleasant chat
about London's share of imperial contribution to local purposes, the
few remaining Members, vainly trving to look as if they’d be “back
in ten minutes,” walked out. House counted; only twenty-five
present, and so home to dinner. -
“Yes, yes,” said WALTER Long, left in charge of Front Opposi-
tion Bench, “but this won't prevent us on Monday, when SQUIRE OF
MALwood proposes to take Tuesday and Friday mornings for public
business, stubbornly resisting piratical incursion on the rights of
private Members. Whatever we are, let us be logical.”
Business done.—Ministerial defeat on Rollit's amendment averted
by majority of one.

†: and, by consequence,
THE BATTLE OF EASTBOURNE.
Natis in usum laetitiaerosis
Pugnare Eastbourni est.
HoRAce (slightly emended).
It is not the English nature, but the English climate that makes
us take our pleasures sadly (if we do, which we don't). And it is not
the fault of the English nature, but of the organisers, if our public
eants are ... , like our statues, more or less -humoured
#. of what they are meant to represent. , Now Eastbourne has
triumphantly shown that, in spite of chilling and heavy rain, England
can rival the sunny South
cession of floral cars. And if Eastbourne can do this, why can it not
be done elsewhere? “Organise, º: organise,” and let the
hireling merrymaker be conspicuously absent. Your hireling will
still wear his armour as if he were bearing the spolia opima of a
burgled marine-store dealer. And the lady hireling, as a sea-nymph
or a shepherdess, can never quite forget what she owes to her dignity
as a respectable married woman. In the interests of the family ex-
chequer, and in the way of business, she may consent to dally with
allegory, but her heart is not in the mermaid's grot, nor do the
spacious times of Great ELIZABETH inspire her, beyond the Victorian
circus-smile, the circus-smile which puts a girdle round about the
in the beauty and variety of a big pro-
coach, carriage, wheel-barrow or cart, in a way, which, speaks
volumes for the artistic sense of the South Saxons. The children, as
children use, took the cake—after Mr. EDGAR BRUCE. They were
there in great numbers and variety, from the little Titania in her
fairy goat-chaise, o'er canopied with flowers and º doves, to the
very small skipper of the very realistic ship, who s on the rainy
deck with drawn sword and unswerving dignity for some two hours
of constant and crowded parading. “Bravo, #. is the re-
sultant cry of gratified spectators, and better weather next time. A
better show it would be ungrateful to suggest.
Umra Khan’s Consigne.

“BRAINS FOR CASH.”
[“The unbridled greediness of some
authors.”—MR. GossE.]
Publisher (nervously). And
what will your terms be for a
short story, in your best style?
Author (loftily). I have only
one style, and that is perfection.
I couldn't think of charging less
than fifty ºne. a page.
Publisher (aghast). Fifty
guineas a page! But are you
aware that Lord MACAULAY got
only ten thousand for the whole of
his history, and that MILTON.—
Author (rudely). Hang MACAU-
LAY and MILTON | Surely you
would not compare those second-
rate writers with myself! If
they were content to work for
starvation wages, I am not.
Publisher. But, say your story
runs to twenty pages, as it pro-
bably will, I shall have to pay
you for that one short tale the
really ridiculous sum of a thou-
sand pounds !
Author (coolly). Yes, it is rather
ridiculous—ridiculously small, I
mean. Still, out of regard to your
preket, I am willing to accept
that inadequate remuneration. Is
it a bargain?
Publisher (with a groan). It
must be. The public demands
your work, and we have no option.
But allow me to remark that your
policy is—
Author (gaily): A Policy of As-
surance, on which you have to pay
the premium. Ha, ha!

Author (deferentially). I have
a really capital idea for a work of
fiction, on a subject which I be-
lieve to be quite original. What
—ahem l—are you prepared to
offer for the copyright?
Publisher. Couldn't think of
making an offer till we saw the
work. It might turn out to be
worth nothing at all.
Author. Nothing at all! But
you forget how my fame—
Publisher. Disappeared when
we were º: to charge the
public six shillings for a story of
yours about the size of an average
tract. Other writers have come
to the front, you know. Still, if

there's anything in your novel,
when it's finished, we should, I
daresay, be prepared to offer you
a couple of guineas down, and a
couple more, when—say—a thou-
sand copies had been sold. Is it
a bargain?
Author (º). I suppose it

said to be paid for my work.
Publisher. Perhaps not. But
you can be said to be paid out !
THE STREETS OF LONDON.
THE stately streets of London
Are always “up” in Spring,
To ordinary minds an ex-
-traordinary thing.
Then cabs across strange ridges
bound
Or sink in holes, abused
With words resembling not, in
sound,
Those Mrs. HEMANs used.
The . streets of London,
Dotted with lamps by night;
What pitfalls where the dazzled
Sees doubly ruddy light.' [eye
For in the season, just in May,
When many meetings meet,
The jocund vestry starts away,
And closes all the street.
The shut-up streets of London!
How willingly one jumps
From where one's cab must stop,
through pools
Of mud, in dancing pumps!
When thus one skipson .."
One's pride is much decreased,
Like Mrs. Gilpin's, for one's
‘‘chaise ’’
Is “three doors off" at least.
The free, fair streets of London!
Long, long, investry hall, .
May heads of native thickness rise,
§. April showers fall;
And green for ever be the men
Who spend the rates in May,
By stopping all the traffic then
In such a jocose way!
IN BLoom.–On Saturday last
there was a letter in the Daily
Telegraph headed “Trees for
Londoners.” The lessee and
manager of the Haymarket
Theatre thinks that for Lon-
doners two Trees are quite suffi-
cient, i.e. his wife and himself.
THE DRINK QUESTION.
First Man. What rot it is to keep this tax on beer!
Second Man, Well, it's better than spirits, anyhow.
First Man. Of course you say that as you’ve got those shares in
that Distillery Company.
Second Man. Well, you needn't talk, with your ALLsopp
Debentures.
First Man. Come to that, personally I take no interest in beer.
It's poison to me.
Second Man. It's the finest drink in the world. I never touch
spirits.
First Man. They're much more wholesome. I wonder what the
Government will do about Local Veto and Compensation. I suppose,
as I’m a Liberal—
Second Man. So am I. But I respect vested interests. Now, in
theory, teetotalism, especially for the masses—
First Man. Waiter, bring me a whiskey and soda.
Second Man. And bring me a glass of bitter.
First Man. As for WILFRID Lawson, he’s an utter—
Second Man. Oh, WILFRID LAwson I He's a downright—

THE LOSS OF THE GALLERY.
(A Fragment from the Chronicles of St. Stephen's.)
“BUT must I give up this comfortable furniture?” asked the
r person, looking at the venerable chairs, some of which were
É.i. rickety. -- - -
“You must, indeed,” replied firmly, but still with a certain tender-
ness, the stern official. - - -
*But I can nearly hear what they are saying,” urged the fair
petitioner.
“I cannot help it.” - -
“And all but see them,” and once againshe peered through thegrille.
“I am forced to obey my orders,” returned the official. “You
applauded: You clap our hands—and you must retire.”
“And for that little st of enthusiasm,” almost wept the
person, “I am to lose all this happiness! To be stopped from hearing
an indistinct murmur, seeing a blurred picture, rººf on rickety
seats, and breathing a vitiated atmosphere! Am I to lose all these
comforts and pleasures and advantages?” -
“I am afraid so,” was the answer. And then the official opened

spirited composition.

ANYoME iº at Burlington House so early as to be the first F. to §
his money and e his choice, will probably look straight before him, and wi
feel somewhat confused at seeing in the distance, but exactly opposite him, a
dignified figure wearing a chain of office, politely rising to receive the early
visitor. “It can be no other than the President himself.” will at once occur to
the stranger within the gates; “and yet, did I not hear that he was abroad for
the benefit of his health P” Then, just as he is about to bow his acknowledg-
ments of the courtesy extended to him personally by the Chief Representative
of Art in this country, he will notice seated, at the President's left hand, and
staring at him, with a pen, in his hand, ready either to take down the name of
the visitor, or to make a sketch of him, a gentleman in whose lineaments any-
one having the pleasure of being personally acquainted with Mr. STAcy MARKs,
R.A., would at once recognise those of that distinguished humourist in bird-
painting. “Is there wisions about?” will the puzzled visitor quote to himself
and then boldly advancing, hat in hand, to be on replaced ºn head, he will
come face to face with the biggest picture in the Academy, covering almost the
entire wall.
The stately figure is not Sir FREDERIc LEIGHToN, P.R.A., who unfortunately
has been compelled to go abroad for the benefit of his health—prosit *-nor is
the seated figure Mr. S. MARKs; but the former is “ The Bürgermeister of

THE UP-TO-DATE DUCKLINGS.
(A Fable.)
. A DUCK that had lately succeeded in hatch-
ing a fine brood of ducklings, and was muc
concerned on the point of their polite educa-
tion, took them down to the river one day in
order to teach them to swim.
“See, my dears!” she said when they were
all got to the bank, addressing her brood in
encou g accents, “this, is the way to do
it,” and so saying the old duck pushed off
from the land, in evident expectation that
her }.}. ones would follow her.
The Ducklings, however, instead of coming
after their mother, remained on the bank, talk-
ing and laughing and whispering among them-
selves in a very knowing manner; until at
last the old bird, provoked by their levity and
.*.*.*. ailed them, called out sharply
to them from mid-stream to come into the
water at once; upon which one of the Duck-
lings, who had evidently been constituted
spokesman for the rest, made bold to address
his mother in the following words.
“You must be a simpleton indeed, Madam,”
said he, “to imagine that we are going to do
anything so foolish as to endanger our lives in
the reckless fashion in which you are now ex-
posing yours; for though it .# be true that
in obedience to some unwritten law of nature
(unknown at present to us) you are floating
securely upon the surface of the stream, in-
stead of sinking to the bottom of it, yet it b
no means follows from thence that we shoul
do the same thing, supposing we were so foolish
as to follow your example. Rest assured, dear
bottom for ourselves, we shall act on the know-
ledge of it, according as our experience may
suggest to us; but for the present, at any rate,
we prefer to remain where we are.”
And so saying, the Duckling, accompanied
by the rest of the brood, turned his back on
his natural element, and returned forthwith
to the poultry-yard.

Or, The Triumph of the Timid One.
At last! I see signs of a turn in the tide,
And O, I perceive it with infinite gratitude.
No more need I go with a crick in my side.
In attempts to preserve a non-natural atti-

Something has changed in the season, some-

I'm sure I can feel a cool whiff of fresh air!
Mental malaria worse than the grippe
Has asphyxiated my mind, or cho º

The plain honest truth has been strange to

bugged it and vamped it
Till I wasn't I, self-respect was all gone,
And I hadn't a taste that Idared my own.
I do not love horror. I do not like muck;
And mystical muddle to me is abhorrent.
In §§§ shallows long time I have stuck,
Or, like a dead dog on a sewage-fouled
torrent,
Have i. with the stream; but beyond the
east doubt
Egomania it seems then is not the last word
Of latter-day wisdom l By Jove I am glad!
I always did feel it was highly absurd
To worship the maudlin, and aim at the
mad;
And now, there's a chance for the decent
again.
One may relish one's DICKENs, yet not seem
insane!
The ghoulish-grotesque, and the grimy-
obscure, -
I have tried to º on in poem and prose,
Butohl all the while there seemed something
impure
In the sniff of the thing that tormented my

And as to High Art—well, to me it seemed
high,
Like an *-hung hare—only food for the fly.
Yet I didn't dare say that I felt it to be, ..
Pseudo-sphinxian fudge, and sheer Belial
bosh;
Or that after Art-babble at five o'clock tea,
I felt * the thing I most craved was—a

FROM CORINTO TO HERNE BAY.
(An Anglo-Nicaraguan Parallel.)
THE young Midshipman looked towards
Corinto. The public buildings were still
within range of the monster guns. The select
army of one hundred and #. had retired
before the advance of the blue jackets and
. N. was :::::::::: as he .
upon the N1caraguan capital, nus eyes closed,
and he dreamed a dream.
He was once more in England. He was at
the seaside. Here in front of him were
*.*.*. There, to his right, was
a circulating library. He could see a clock-
tower and a shortened pier. Then he laughed
in his glee. He was at Herne Bay ! Close
to the Isle of Thanet—within sight of the
Reculvers
He had scarcely realised his happiness, when
he noticed on the ocean a flotilla. Three
gigantig , ironclads were approaching the
..“The Nicaraguan fleet!” he murmured in
his sleep.
It, , alas! was too true! . The Central
American Admiral had sentanultimatum. The
news had run from one end of Herne Bay to the
other that, unless the sum demanded were
paid at once, the as-yet-unconquered water-
ing-place would be “ploughed,” as the Poet
BUNN would have put it, “ by the hoof of the
ruthless invader.”
Then there was a hurried consultation.
What could be done with that overpowering
fleet? It was useless to defend the bathing-
machines; the donkeys and their drivers were
no match for heavy ordnance. What could
the few coast-guardsmen do when threatened
by five hundred Nicaraguans?
“Herne Bay must surrender!” murmured
the Midshipman in his sleep. “There is no
help for it.
And then came a strange sight. The
search-lights of the Nicaraguan fleet played
upon the sea front, and the little garrison of
º: The Band .# from the Militia)
marched away, followed by the heavy cavalry
of the bathers, and the Uhlan-like donkeys
of the sands. The representatives of the Navy
(carrying their look-out telescopes) brought
up the rear.
Then, when all had gone, the sailors and
marines of the Nicaraguan fleet landed. The
British flag was hauled down, and replaced
by the colours of the enemy.
Herne Bay was conquered! -
At this point the Midshipman awoke with
a start. He looked round, and sighed a great
sigh of relief. -
“How fortunate it is that the English fleet
have conquered Corinto and, not the Nica-
raguan fleet Herne Bay !” he cried in an
ecstacy of patriotic fervour. Then he per-
formed for hours the duties of his command.
Towards the close of day he again casually
glanced at Corinto and once more was in-
voluntarily reminded of Herne Bay. And as
he gazed upon the Central American town he
came to the conclusion that it was about as
formidable and about as well defended as the
Kentish watering-place... And having arrived
at this opinion he determined in his own mind
that the taking of Corinto, as a feat of arms
was scarcely on a par with the Victory o
Trafalgar.

afternoon sitting, and the inconsiderable Friday night.
..More marked this cultured mannerism when announcing imme-
diate introduction of Bill prohibiting plural voting. This a genuine
surprise. Not been talked of since House met. Nobody thinking of
it., SQUIRE in almost whisper announced its introduction to-morrow.
Astonished, beyond measure at commotion created; the boisterous
cheers of Liberals, the uneasy laughter of Opposition.
“Most remarkable place this House of Commons,” he said after-
wards, #. over my head into the infinite horizon, where shado
figure of Local Veto Bill is visible to the eye of faith. "Always §
of surprises even for old practitioners like you and me.”
. PRINCE ARTHUR, muc º: this i. humour, was himself
in sprightliest mood. The whole business of Session, he protested,
was an elaborate joke. If they were there to work, he would take
to play. “Well, let us play,” he said, holding out both hands with
gesture of invitation to Treasury Bench.
Proposal irresistible. House divided forthwith; SQUIRE's motion
carried by majority of 22; then, whilst half a dozen naval
men talked water-tube boiler, PRINCE ARTHUR, SQUIRE of MAL-
wood, and picked company from either side went out behind
SPEAKER's Chair to play. Such larks! To see PRINCE ARTHUR take
in a stride “the backs” given him by the SQUIRE of MALwoop,
with CAwMEL-BANNERMAN next; to see JoHN MoRLEY seriously
whipping a top; to watch BRYCE breathless behind the nimble
hoop; to look on while EDwARD GREY, forgetful of China and
Japan, thinking nothing of Nicaragua, played a game of marbles
with HART DYKE; to see Lockwood trying a spurt with DICK
WEBSTER, the course being twice, round the Division Lobby,
Asquith, fresh from the Cab-arbitration, having handicapped them
—to see this, and much else, was a spectacle wholesome for those
engaged in it, interesting for the solitary spectator.
Business done.—Shipbuilding Wote in Navy Estimates agreed to.

argue if we have one man one vote, one BILI: one. Bill, is all
right. Yes; but, as SARK with his keen mathematical instinct
points out, this is a case of two Bills—BIII, the Member for Leek,
and a Bill to empower magistrates to prohibit the sale of intoxicating
liquors to persons, previously convicted of drunkenness., That is
obviously a plurality of Bills. But we are getting #. mixed.

Trust ToMMY for clever management. Hold-
ing sheaf of notes firmly in left hand, deftly

speech on Naval Works Loan Bill. Here and
there, when he observed restless movement in
any part of House, fired off phrase about
“forty - shilling freeholder,” “occupation

tribution,” “country going to the dogs,”
“jerrymandering,” and “right hon. gentle-

I HAVE the honour to inform your Excellency that I am instructed
by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that Her Britannic
Majesty's Government has reason to complain of the conduct of the
Government of which your Excellency is the representative. I have
the honour to say that it will be advisable for your Excellency to urge
upon the Government of which your Excellency is the representative
the necessity of inquiry into the matter as, speedily as possible... I
have further the honour to add that it will be gratifying to Her
Britannic Majesty's Government, if the Government of which your
Excellency is a representative will give the matter to which I refer
the earliest attention.
From the Representative, dºc., to the – Minister, &c.
January 1, 18-1.
I have the honour to call the attention of your Excellency to the
long and unsatisfactory correspondence that has passed during the
last year between §. Excellency as representing the Government
of which you are the representative and the Secretary of State for
Foreign Affairs upon the matter of the despatch I had the honour to
forward to your Excellency dated January 1, 18–0. I am directed to
have the honour of requesting your Excellency to urge upon the
Government of which your Excellency is a representative the neces-
sity of a speedy settlement of the matter in dispute.
From the Representative, dºc., to the – Minister, dºc.
January 1, 18-2.

ODE TO A (LONDON) “LARK.”
(Some Way after Quisquis.)
OH, “lark,” which all the “Comiques” sing,
And every drunken rowdy pup, too;
Sure you’re a vicious, vulgar thing
As ever toper swigged a cup to.
Hints of the boozy and the blue
Surround you; sodden brains you soften;
Yet rhymsters make a song of you,
And rowdies sing it—far too often.
The aim of every loº-lipped lout
Appears to be to “lark” divinely;
When from his haunts he gets chucked out,’
He deems his “spree” has ended finely.
He tracks the “lark”—aye, “like a bird,”
Upon the turf, among its “daisies”;
But, by sweet SHELLEY, 'tis absurd,
Foul bird of prey, to pipe your praises."
A KIND OFFER.—A lady who is not well
up in Parliamentary matters writes to us
saying that she has seen mentioned in the

SPEAKER is so great that, our fair corre-

efray the whole amount herself, or if the
total be too much for her pocket, then would
she cheerfully head a subscription list.
She is perfectly certain that Mr. PEEL was

sum cannot be very startling.

Right Hon. Gentleman. Well, TENTERFoRE, anything for me this

Prirate Secretary. I think not. You will find that I have worked
out the answers to to-day's questions—the list is not a very heavy
one, only a couple of dozen queries or thereabouts.
Rt. Hon. Gent. That’s right. Such a lot of time is wasted in that

Priv. Sec. No one of importance. A fellow with a new invention
or something of that sort. Said you were extremely busy just now
but that if he would write, his letter would receive the attention of
the department.
Rt. Hon. Gent. Was he satisfied?
Prir. Sec. (smiling). Well, I fear not entirely. I think, he must
have had some experience of Government offices. He said he pre-
ferred to see you personally.
Rt. Hon. Gent. º daresay he would. Anyone else?

My very dear Sir, I am delighted to see you.. (He shakes hands
warmly and provides him with an arm-chair.) I am sorry you
should have been detained-quite a mistake.
Stranger (surprised). You are most kind. I come about some
advertisements.
Rt. Hon. Gent. I know, my dear Sir, I know. Now what can
Itempt you with ? You arrive at a most fortunate moment. We
are thinking of letting the sides of our cruisers for posters. The
Mediterranean fleet will be a most excellent medium. We can do
sixteen double crowns at a very reasonable rate; of course the
Admiral's flag-ship would be a trifle extra. Is your leading article
soap, pickles, or hair-dye?
Stranger. I am afraid you do not understand me.
Rt. Hon. Gent. Oh yes, I do; but, if you object to marine adver-
tisements, I think we can suit you on land. e have several com-
manding positions on the colours of some of the most popular regi-
ments in the service vacant., (Showing plans.), You see we can
insert type—we object to blocks—on the material without interfer-
ing with the badges or the victories. A most admirable medium,
I assure you.
Stranger. You really are in error. I wish to say—
Rt., Hon. Gent, (interrupting). Yes, I know. You, think that
something would be better. Well, we can put advertisements on
the backs of all petitions presented to Parliament, and let you out
hoardings in front of the more prominent of the Government offices.
How would that suit you?
Stranger, Really, you must allow me to explain. Advertisements
of matters interesting to mariners—such as notices of wrecks—are
inserted solely in the London Gazette and—
Rt. Hon. Gent. Ah, you are thinking of the sky signs. Well, of
course, we might utilise the lighthouses, but we have not quite made
up our minds whether such a course might not cause confusion in
misty weather.
Stranger. I was going to propose that the Government might feel
inclined to insert the advertisements to which I have referred in a
paper with which I am connected, and which is extensively circulated
amongst seafaring men.
Rt. Hon. Gent. (astounded). You want me to give you an adver-
tisement! No, Sir; now that we have taken up advertisements we
insert them and don't give them out. (Enter Private Secretary.)
Mr. TENTERFoRE, be so good as to explain to this gentleman that my
time is valuable.

FROM CORINTO TO HERNE BAY. hi
(An Anglo-Nicaraguan Parallel.)
THE young Midshipman looked towards
Corinto. The public buildings were still
within range of the monster guns. The select
army of one hundred and fifty had retired
before the advance of the blue jackets and
. Nº. Was *...*::: as he .
upon the N1caraguan capital, his eyes closed,
and he dreamed a dream.
He was once more in England. He was at
the seaside. Here in front of him were
*...*. There, to his right, was
a circulating library. He could see a clock-
tower and a shortened pier. Then he laughed
in his glee. He was at Herne Bay! Close
to the Isle of Thanet—within sight of the
Reculvers!
He had scarcely realised his happiness, when
he noticed on the ocean a flotilla. Three
gigantic ironclads were approaching the
."4. Nicaraguan fleet !” he murmured in
s sleep.
It, alas! was too true! The Central
American Admiral had sentanultimatum. The
news had run from one end of Herne Bay to the
other that, unless the sum demanded were
paid at once, the as-yet-unconquered water-
ing-place would be “ploughed,” as the Poet
BUNN would have put it, “by the hoof of the
ruthless invader.”
Then there was a hurried consultation.
What could be done with that º;
fleet? It was useless to defend the bathing-
machines; the donkeys and their drivers were
no match for heavy ordnance. What could
the few coast-guardsmen do when threatened
by five hundred Nicaraguans?
“Herne Bay must surrender!” murmured
the Midshipman in his sleep. “There is no
help for it.
And then came a strange sight. The
search-lights of the Nicaraguan fleet played
upon the sea front, and the little garrison of
Margate. The Band $º from the Militia)
marched away, followed by the heavy cavalry
of the bathers, and the Uhlan-like donkeys
of the sands. The representatives of the Navy
(carrying their look-out telescopes) brought
up the rear.
Then, when all had gone, the sailors and
marines of the Nicaraguan fleet landed. The
British flag was hauled down, and replaced
by the colours of the enemy,
Herne Bay was conquered! -
At this point the Midshipman awoke with
a start. He looked round, and sighed a great
sigh of relief. - -
“How fortunate it is that the English fleet
have conquered Corinto and, not the Nica-
raguan fleet Herne Bay !” he cried in an
ecstacy of patriotic fervour. Then he per-
formed for hours the duties of his command.
Towards the close of day he again casually
glanced at Corinto and once more was in-
voluntarily reminded of Herne Bay. And as
he gazed upon the Central American town he
came to the conclusion that it was about as
formidable and about as well defended as the
Kentish watering-place. And haying arrived
at this opinion he determined in his own mind
that the taking of Corinto, as a feat of arms
was scarcely on a par with the Victory of
Trafalgar.

FAIR CHILDREN IN GRAFTON STREET.
A SPLENDID show, though some of the children are neither fair nor
beautiful... Note No.114, “The Chinese Boy,” by Sir Joshua. He is a
boy, pertainly; but his complexion has a mahogany tinge not usually
associated with loveliness. CATHERINE DE MEDICſs, if we may judge
by No. 67, was a plain, decent, housewifely body, with a family of
four horrors, three male and one female, all of whom, eventually,
wore a crown, Can it be possible that La Reine Margot ever looked
like that? If so, the great DUMAs is convicted of gross deceit. For
a screaming farce in oil, let the visitor look at No. 155, “The Infant
ºſobnsom,” by Sir Joshua. Some one has evidently suggested to the
baby lexicographer that he should have a bath. Naturally enough
he is furious at the idea. “Sir,” he seems to say, “let us take a
erambulator down Fleet Street, or anywhere else, but let us not
bathe.” Can there not be found a companion picture of the mighty
infant in a cheerful mood, prattling out a “What, nurse, are you
for a frolic * Then I’m with you.” In a case labelled No. 454 are
to be seen toys, dolls, and playthings found in Children's Tombs in
Egypt; Here, too, is the “Mummy of a Baby.” “I see the
baby,” observed an intelligent child-visitor; “but where is its
Mummy? My Mummy never ties baby up like that.”
Not DUE NoFTH-The North British Daily Mail, referring to
the rumour that the Prince of WALEs may go to New York in the
autumn to see the contest for the America Cup, says: “There will be
better racing on the Clyde than there was last year. Let the PRINCE
come north at midsummer this year.” Wery likely the race on the
Clyde will be a good one. But our Scottish ###". forgets
that a visit to the United States on the part of H.R.H. would be to
the advantage of two races—the American and the British. It would
be sure to cause good feeling on either side of the Atlantic. Why

might only have a limited circulation—be...known only to your

to even so partial a publication as I have shadowed forth which make
it most desirable that we should have an opportunity of giving the

EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, April 29.--When Mr. Toots, in
tº. perturbed bashfulness, sat down on Florence Dombey's
best bonnet, he murmured, “Oh, it's of no consequence.” Squire
ºf MAEwoon does not resemble, Mr. Toots in any respect, not even
that of bashfulness... But he has a way, when taking important
move, of studiously investing it with, appearance of “no conse-
quence.” Thus to-night, asking for lion’s share of time for re-
maining portion of Session, he could hardly bring himself to uplift
his Yoice:, mumbled over phrases; coughed at conjunctions; half
paralysed by prepositions; looked round with pained astonishment
when Members behind cried, “Speak up!” y should he trouble
to speak up on so immaterial a matter? Still, to oblige, he would
say, all he wanted was to take for Government purposes, for rest
of Session, all the time of House, save the inconvenient Wednesday
afternoon sitting, and the inconsiderable Friday night.
..More marked this cultured mannerism when announcing imme-
diate introduction of Bill Fº plural voting. This a genuine
surprise. Not been talked of since House met. §obody thinking of
it. SQUIRE in almost whisper announced its introduction to-morrow.
Astonished, beyond measure at commotion created; the boisterous
cheers of Liberals, the uneasy laughter of Opposition.
“Most remarkable place ; House of 8. he said after-
wards, gazing, over my head into the infinite horizon, where shado
figure of Local Veto Bill is visible to the eye of faith. Tº Always
of surprises even for old practitioners like you and me.”
. PRINCE, ARTHUR, much relishing this subtle humour, was himself
in sprightliest mood. The whole business of ion, he protested,
was an elaborate joke. If they were there to work, he would take
to play. "Well, let us play,” he said, holding out both hands with
gesture of invitation to fº Bench. -
Proposal irresistible. House divided forthwith; SquTRE's motion
carried by majority of 22; then, whilst half a dozen naval
men talked water-tube boiler, PRINCE ARTHUR, Squire of MAL-
wood, and picked company from either side went out behind
SPEAKER's Chair to play. Such larks! To see PRINCE ARTHUR take
in a stride “the backs” given him by the Squire of MALwoop,
with CAwMEL-BANNERMAN next; to see John MoRLEY seriously
whipping a top; to watch BRYCE breathless behind the nimble
hoop; to look on while Edward GREY, forgetful of China and
Japan, thinking nothing of Nicaragua, played a game of marbles
with HART DYKE; to see Lockwood trying a spurt with Dick
WEBSTER, the course being twice, round . the Division Lobby,
Asquith, fresh from the Cab-arbitration, having handicapped them
—to see this, and much else, was a spectacle wholesome for those
engaged in it, interesting for. the solitary spectator.

argue if we have one man one vote, one BILL one Bill is all
right. Yes; but, as SARK with his keen mathematical instinct
points out, this is a case of two Bills—BILL, the Member for Leek,
and a Bill to empower magistrates to prohibit the sale of intoxicating

obviously a plurality of Bills. But we are getting *:::::: mixed.

nounced on Thursday that, at Monday's
sitting, Naval Works Loan Bill would be
proceeded with. ToMMY accordingly clewed
up, and ran for port; º: to for forty-
eight hours, P. speech on Naval Works.
Now SQUIRE y announced that Ship-
building Wote was to be taken. What was
ToMMY to do with speech prepared on Naval
Works Loans ?
In despair yesterday; to-day bright idea
struck him, SHAw-LEFEvº had moved, to
introduce One Man One Wote Bill. Why
shouldn't ToMMY, flying that flag, run in and
deliver his speech on Naval Works? A bold
experiment; only hope of success was that

Trust ToMMY for clever management. Hold-
ing sheaf of notes firmly in left hand, deftly
turning them over with the hook that serves
him for right hand, the old salt read his
speech on Naval Works Loan Bill. Here and
there, when he observed restless movement in
any part of House, fired off phrase about
“forty - shilling freeholder,” “occupation
votes,” “ rural constituencies,”, “re-dis-
tribution,” “country going to the dogs,”
“jerrymandering,” and “right hon, gentle-
man opposite.” Scheme worked admirably;
speech reeled off, and Squire of MALwood's

by prospect of Budget night. On such occasion in ordinary times
attendance at prayer-time most encouraging to Chaplain. Begins to
think that at last his ministrations are bearing fruit. This afternoon
congregation not much above average. No rush for tickets for seats.
When SQUIRE rose to open his statement, great gaps below Gang-
way on Ministerial side. The SQUIRE, recognising situation, refrained
from heroics, content to deliver plain business speech. No exordium;
no peroration; no flight into empyrean heights of eloquence as was
the wont of Mr. G. Some sympathetic movement when Squib E, with
. increased briskness of manner, spoke of snap of cold
Weatner in
death-rate, and fuller flow of death duties into
National coffers. The quality of this mercy
was not quite unstrained. Not dropping, like
the gentle dew from heaven, till February, in-
creased death rates will not come into account
till succeeding year. Still, there was rum; As
thermometer # rum went up with a rush.-
Fifteen men on a dead man's chest.
High ho! and a bottle of rum.
What with comforting the mourners, and
imbibed as a preventive, rum brought a
windfall of £100,000 into the Treasury.
That was well in its way. But then there
were those 75,000 mean-spirited, people who
ought to have died last year, their estates
paying tribute to CHANCELLOR of ExchEQUER,
and who positively insisted upon living. The
long-trained fortitude of the SQUIRE nearly
broke down when he mentioned this circum-
stance. Pretty to see how it. also touched
JokIM. The wounds of riven friendship tem-
porarily closed up; the rivalry of recent years
forgotten in contemplation of these 75,000
reckless, ruthless people who, in defiance of
law of average, didn't die in financial year
ending March 31, 1895. The past ChancELLOR
of ExchEquER and his successor in office
mingled their tears. But for intervention of
table they would probably have flung them-
selves into each other's arms and sobbed aloud.
“Thus,” said PRINCE ARTHUR, himself not
unaffected by the scene, “doth one touch of
nature make Chancellors of the Exchequer
kin.” Business done.—Budget brought in.
Friday Night.—ALPHEUs CLEOPHAs submitted proposal to dock
payment of £10,000 annuity to Duke of CobURa. Thinks, H.R.H.
might, in circumstances, get along nicely without it. SAGE of
QUEEN ANNE's GATE agrees. T. H. Bolton PARTY, on the other hand,
gravely differs. Folding his arms as was his wont on eve of
Austerlitz, he regards ALPHEUs. CLEOPHAs with aw frown.
Imperial instincts naturally wounded. “No triflung with the per-
sonal revenues of our Royal cousins, whether at home or abroad,”
said T. H. Bolton PARTY in the voice of thunder that once rever-
berated across the shivering chasms of the Alps. -
Business done.—Proposal to cut off Duke of CobURG's pension
ebruary, with its accompaniment of influenza, increased negatived by 193 votes against 72.
TWO WAYS OF DOING IT.
FIRST WAY.
From the Representative of Her Britannic Majesty's Government to
the – Minister for Foreign Affairs.

I HAVE the honour to inform }. Excellency that I am instructed
by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that Her Britannic
Majesty's Government has reason to complain of the conduct of the
Government of which your Excellency is the representative. I have
the honour to say that it will be advisable for your Excellency to urge
upon the Government of which your Excellency is the representative
the necessity of inquiry into the matter as ily as possible. I
have further the honour to add that it will be gratifying to Her
Britannic Majesty's Government, if the Government of which your
Excellency is a representative will give the matter to which I refer
the earliest attention.
From the Representative, dºc., to the – Minister, dºc.
January 1, 18-1.
I have the honour to call the attention of your Excellency to the
long and unsatisfactory correspondence that has passed during the
last year between your Excellency as representing the Government
of which you are the representative and the Secretary of State for
Foreign Affairs upon the matter of the despatch I had the honour to
forward to your Excellency dated January 1, 18-0. I am directed to
have the honour of requesting your Excellency to urge upon the
Government of which your Excellency is a representative the neces-
sity of a speedy settlement of the matter in dispute.
From the Representative, dºc., to the – Minister, dec,
- January 1, 18-2.
º: again the honour to call the attention of your Excellency
, &c. &c.
(Rather longer than the foregoing one. Then follow two more
“from the same to the same” in 18-3 and 18–4. This is the
SEcond (AND SHORTER) WAY.
From British Admiral to — Minister.
January 1, 18–5, 12 Noon.
If you don’t pay up within a quarter of an hour, I will bombard
your capital, seize your country, and imprison the Government of
which you are the representative.
From — Minister, dºc., to British Admiral.
January 1, 18–5, 12.10 P.M.
Don't fire. Have sent money demanded by P.O.O.

And every drunken rowdy pup, too;
Sure you’re a vicious, vulgar thing

And rowdies sing it—far too often.

When from his haunts he gets chucked out,'
He deems his “spree” has ended finely.

she cheerfully head a subscription list.

are thinking of letting the sides of our cruisers for posters. The
Mediterranean fleet will be a most excellent medium. We can do
sixteen double crowns at a very reasonable rate; of course the
Admiral's flag-ship would be a trifle extra. Is your leading article

ments in the service vacant. (Showing plans.), You see we can
insert type—we object to blocks—on the material without interfer-
ing with the badges or the victories. A most admirable medium,
I assure you.
Stranger. You really are in error. I wish to say—
Rt., Hon. Gent, (interrupting). Yes, I know. You, think that
something would be better. Well, we can put advertisements on
the backs of all petitions presented to Parliament, and let you out
hoardings in front of the more prominent of the Government offices.
How would that suit you?
Stranger. Really, you must allow me to explain. Advertisements
of matters interesting to mariners—such as notices of wrecks—are
inserted solely in the London Gazette and—
Rt. Hon. Gent. Ah, you are thinking of the sky signs. Well, of
course, we might utilise the lighthouses, but we have not quite made
up our minds whether such a course might not cause confusion in
misty weather.
Stranger. I was going to propose that the Government might feel
inclined to insert the advertisements to which I have referred in a
paper with which I am connected, and which is extensively circulated
amongst seafaring men.
Rt. Hon. Gent. (astounded). You want me to give you an adver-
tisement! No, Sir; now that we have taken up advertisements we
insert them and don't give them out. (Enter Private Secretary.)

I HAVE the honour to inform }. Excellency that I am instructed
by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that Her Britannic
Majesty's Government has reason to complain of the conduct of the
Government of which your Excellency is the representative. I have
the honour to say that it will be advisable for your Excellency to urge
upon the Government of which your Excellency is the representative
the necessity of inquiry into the matter as speedily as possible. I
have further the honour to add that it will be gratifying to Her
Britannic Majesty's Government, if the Government of which your
Excellency is a representative will give the matter to which I refer
the earliest attention.
From the Representative, dºc., to the – Minister, dºc.
January 1, 18-1.
I have the honour to call the attention of your Excellency to the
long and unsatisfactory correspondence that has passed during the
last year between §. Excellency as representing the Government
of which you are the representative and the Secretary of State for
Foreign Affairs upon the matter of the despatch I had the honour to
forward to your Excellency dated January 1, 18–0. I am directed to
have the honour of requesting your Excellency to urge upon the
Government of which your Excellency is a representative the neces-
sity of a speedy settlement of the matter in dispute.

SEconD (AND ShokTER) WAY.
From British Admiral to — Minister.
January 1, 18–5, 12 Noon.
If you don't pay up within a quarter of an hour, I will bombard
your capital, seize your country, and imprison the Government of

SSº
ODE TO A (LONDON) “LARK.”
(Some Way after Quisquis.)
OH, “lark,” which all the “Comiques” sing,
And every drunken rowdy pup, too;
Sure you’re a vicious, vulgar thing
As ever toper swigged a cup to.
Hints of the boozy and the blue
Surround you; sodden brains you soften;
Yet rhymsters make a song of you,
And rowdies sing it—far too often.
The aim of every loº-lipped lout
Appears to be to “lark” divinely;
When from his haunts he gets chucked out,"
He deems his “spree” has ended finely.
He tracks the “lark”—aye,"like a bird,”
Upon the turf, among its “daisies”;
But, by sweet SHELLEY, 'tis absurd,
Foul bird of prey, to pipe your praises.'
A KIND OFFER.—A lady who is not well
up in Parliamentary matters writes to us
saying that she has seen mentioned in the
papers “Mr. Speaker's Retirement, Bill,”
and would very much like to know what the
amount is. er admiration for the late
SPEAKER is so great that, our fair corre-
*: goes on to say, she would willingly
efray the whole amount herself, or if the
total be too much for her pocket, then would
she cheerfully head a subscription list.
She is perfectly certain that Mr. PEEL was
a very moderate man, and therefore the entire
sum cannot be very startling.

Right #on. Gentleman. Well, TENTERFoRE, anything for me this
morning
Prirate Secretary. I think not. You will find that I have worked
out the answers to to-day's questions—the list is not a very heavy
one, only a couple of dozen queries or thereabouts.
Rt. Hon. Gent. That’s right. Such a lot of time is wasted in that
sort of thing. And has anyone come forme?
Prir. Sec. No one of importance. A fellow with a new invention
or something of that sort. Said you were extremely busy just now,
but that if he would write, his letter would receive the attention of
the department.
Rt. Hon. Gent. Was he satisfied?
Prir. Sec. (smiling). Well, I fear not entirely. I think, he must
have had some experience of Government offices. He said he pre-
ferred to see you personally.
Rt. Hon. Gent. º daresay he would. Anyone else?
Prir. Sec. Only a man about advertisements.
JRt. Hon. Gent. (*} You did not send him away?
Priv. Sec. Well, no. believe he is still in the waiting-room.
But surely you don't want to see him?
Rt. Hon. Gent. Of course I do. A most important person. Send
a messenger for him at once. (Erit Private Secretary.) That's the
worst of TENTERFoRE—so impulsive! Means well, but so very im-
pulsive! (Knock.) Ah, here comes my visistor. (Enter stranger.)
My very dear Sir, I am delighted to see you.. (He shakes hands
warmly and procides him with an arm-chair.) I am sorry you
should have been detained—quite a mistake.
Stranger (surprised). You are most kind. I come about some
advertisements.
Rt. Hon. Gent. I know, my dear Sir, I know. Now what can
Itempt you with ? You arrive at a most fortunate moment. We
are thinking of letting the sides of our cruisers for posters. The
Mediterranean fleet will be a most excellent medium. We can do
sixteen double crowns at a very reasonable rate; of course the
Admiral's flag-ship would be a trifle extra. Is your leading article
soap, pickles, or hair-dye?
Stranger. I am afraid you do not understand me.
Rt. Hon. Gent. Oh yes, I do; but, if you object to marine adver-
tisements, I think we can suit you on land. e have several com-
manding positions on the colours of some of the most popular regi-

insert type—we object to blocks—on the material without interfer-
ing with the badges or the victories. A most admirable medium,
I assure you.
Stranger. You really are in error. I wish to say—
Rt., Hon. Gent, (interrupting). Yes, I know. You, think that
something would be better. Well, we can put advertisements on
the backs of all petitions presented to Parliament, and let you out
hoardings in front of the more prominent of the Government offices.
How would that suit you?
Stranger. Really, you must allow me to explain. Advertisements
of matters interesting to mariners—such as notices of wrecks—are
inserted solely in the London Gazette and—
Rt. Hon. Gent. Ah, you are thinking of the sky signs. Well, of
course, we might utilise the lighthouses, but we have not quite made
up our minds whether such a course might not cause confusion in
misty weather.
Stranger. I was going to propose that the Government might feel
inclined to insert the advertisements, to which I have referred in a
paper with which I am connected, and which is extensively circulated
amongst seafaring men.
Rt. Hon. Gent. (astounded). You want me to give you an adver-
tisement! No, Sir; now that we have taken up advertisements we
insert them and don't give them out, (Enter Private Secretary.)

time is valuable.

rugged, weather-beaten cheek, fresh infamy
on part of SQUIRE of MALwood. ' Had an-
nounced on Thursday that, at . Monday's
sitting, Naval Works Loan Bill would be
proceeded with. "Tommy accordingly clowed
up, and ran for port; º: to for forty-
eight hours, pre speech on Naval Works.
Now SQUIRE y announced that Ship-
building Wote was to be taken. What was
ToMMY to do with speech prepared on Naval
Works Loans ?
In despair yesterday; to-day bright idea
struck him. SHAw-LEFEVRE had moved to
introduce One Man One Wote Bill. Why
shouldn't ToMMY, flying that flag, run in and
deliver his speech on Naval Works? A bold
experiment; only *. of success was that
House, being in ost comatose state,
wouldn't notice ruse if cleverly managed.
Trust ToMMY for clever management. Hold-
ing sheaf of notes firmly in left hand, deftly
turning them over with the hook that serves
him for right hand, the old salt read his
speech on Naval Works Loan Bill. Here and
there, when he observed restless movement in
* part of House, fired off phrase about
“forty - shilling freeholder,” “occupation
votes,” “ constituencies,” “re-dis-
tribution,” “country going to the dogs,”
“jerrymandering,” and “right hon. gentle-
man opposite.” Scheme worked admirably;
speech reeled off, and Squire of MALwood's
knavish trick confounded.
Business done.—One Man One Wote Bill
brought in.
Thursday.—House not to be moved to evidence of excitement even
by prospect of Budget night. On such occasion in ordinary times
attendance at prayer-time most encouraging to Chaplain. Begins to
think that at last his ministrations are bearing fruit. This afternoon
congregation not much above average. No rush for tickets for seats.
When SQUIRE rose to open his statement, great gaps below Gang-
way on Ministerial side. The SQUIRE, recognising situation, refrained
from heroics, content to deliver plain business speech. No exordium;
no peroration; no flight into empyrean heights of eloquence as was
the wont of Mr. G. Some sympathetic movement when Squire, with
momentarily increased briskness of manner, spoke of snap of cold
weather in February, with its accompaniment of influenza, increased

death-rate, and fuller flow of death duties into
National coffers. The quality of this mercy
was not quite unstrained. Not dropping, like
the gentle dew from heaven, till February, in-
creased death rates will not come into account
till succeeding year. Still, there was rum; As
thermometer fell rum went up with a rush.-
Fifteen men on a dead man's chest.
High ho! and a bottle of rum.
What with comforting the mourners, and
imbibed as a preventive, rum brought a
windfall of £100,000 into the Treasury.
That was well in its way. But then there
were those 75,000 mean-spirited, people who
ought to have died last year, their estates
paying tribute to CHANCELLOR of ExchEQUER,
and who positively insisted upon living. The
long-trained fortitude of the SQUIRE nearly
broke down when he mentioned this circum-
stance. Pretty to see how it. also touched
JokIM. The wounds of riven friendship tem-
porarily closed up; the rivalry of recent years
forgotten in contemplation of these 75,000
reckless, ruthless pººl who, in defiance of
law of average, didn't die in financial year
ending March 31, 1895. The past CBANCELLOR
of ExchequER and his successor in office
mingled their tears. But for intervention of
table they would probably have flung them-
selves into each other's arms and sobbed aloud.
“Thus,” said PRINCE ARTHUR, himself not
unaffected by the scene, “doth one touch of
nature make Chancellors of the Exchequer
kin.” Business done.—Budget brought in.
Friday Night.—ALPHEUs CLEOPHAs submitted proposal to dock
payment of £iO,000 annuity to Duke of CobURG. Thinks H.R.H.
might, in circumstances, get along nicely without it. SAGE of
QUEEN ANNE's GATE agrees. T. H. Bolton PARTY, on the other hand,
gravely differs. Folding his arms as was his wont on eve of
Austerlitz, he regards ALPHEUs. CLEOPHAs with a frown.
Imperial instincts naturally wounded. “No triflung with the per-
sonal revenues of our Royal cousins, whether at home or abroad,”
said T. H. Bolton PARTY in the voice of thunder that once rever-
berated across the shivering chasms of the Alps. -
Business done.—Proposal to cut off Duke of CobURG's pension
negatived by 193 votes against 72.

DEAR CHARLIE,-'Ow are you, old shipmate?
I’ve bin layin' low for a time.
'Ard years these 'ere Nineties, my nibs, yus,
and bizness 'as bin fur from prime.
All grind and no gay §alºt, CHARLIE, of late

It's Newness wot's doing it,
CHARLIE! “Lor! that's
a rum gospel,” sez you.
Well, p'raps in your green
tooral-looral you don't
hear so much of the New;
But in town with New Art,
and New Women, New
Drammer, NewHumour,
and such,
There seems nothink old left in creation, save
four-arf, and DANNEL's old Dutch.
She’s old, and no hapricots, CHARLIE. But
DANNEL's a decentish sort,
And the way as she lays down the law about
up-to-date woman is sport.
'Er nutcrackers clitter and clatter; and when
she is fair on the shout,
Concernin' fresh feminine fashions, you bet
it's a reglar knock-out!
I took LIL, DANNEL's youngest, larst week to
the play, with some tickets I'd got.
Well, paperers mustn't be choosers.
They ever chucked over the footlights, this
'ere Probblem Play wos the wust
It left me with brain discumfuddled, the

It gave poor LIL’ARRIs the 'orrors. “Lor,

but wot is the 'ole thing about?
I feel just as creepy and 'oller, along o' these

Let's 'ave a glarss at ‘The Posts.’”
It took two 'ot tiddleys to warm 'er.
when I was blowin' a cloud
A-top o' the tram going 'ome, she sez,
‘’’ARRY,” sez she, “I ain't proud,
But don't tyke me never no more to no New

“It’s Fº and not one good snivel or
larf in the whole jamboree.

Two gurl-probblems, sniffing at Marriage,

I thought we was fair up-to-date, LIL, but,
bless yer, we're simply pea-green!”

And when we arrived at Lamb's Conduit
Street, old DANNEL’ARRIs's shop,
His old Dutch got fair on the grind, and
when started she's orkud to stop.
“New Woman?” sex she. “She’s no clarss,
Yah! We used to call 'em Old Cats; and a
sootabler name, too, by far.
“There ain't nothink new in their Newness;
it’s only old garbige warmed up.

Weddings 'll outlast that lot;
And while gals is gals the old. Eve'll jest
make the new evil seem rot.”
The jawsome old guffin wos right, CBARLIE;
leastways, she wosn’t fur out.
Yer female footballers and bikers, as swagger
and go on the shout,
And spile a good sport and their hancles, are
not more complete off the track
Than them as “revolt”—agin Nature, and

The Old Dutch, and young LIL, and myself

Old 'ARRIs sez men are not in it. He don't
mean it, I'll bet a bob.
It ain't very likely, not now, that Yours
Scrumptiously ever will marry;
But if I . tyke a Old Woman, it won't

associated with loveliness. CATHERINE DE MEDICIs, if we may judge
by No. 67, was a plain, decent, housewifely tº: with a family of
four horrors, three male and one female, all of whom, eventually,
wore a crown. Can it be possible that La Reine Margot ever looked
like that? If so, the great DUMAs is convicted of gross deceit. For
a screaming farce in oil, let the visitor look at No. 155, “The Infant
Johnson,” by Sir Joshua. Some one has evidently suggested to the
baby lexicographer that he should have a bath. Naturally enqugh
he is furious at the idea. “Sir,” he seems to say, “let us take a
º: down Fleet Street, or anywhere else, but let us not
bathe.” Can there not be found a companion picture of the mighty
infant in a cheerful mood, prattling out a “What, nurse, are you
for a frolic P. Then I’m with vou.” In a case labelled No. 454 are
to be seen toys, dolls, and playthings found in Children's Tombs in
Egypt. Here, too, is the “Mummy of a Baby.” “I see the
baby,” observed an intelligent child-visitor; “but where is its
Mummy? My Mummy never ties baby up like that.”
Not DUE North.-The North British Daily Mail, referring to
the rumour that the Prince of WALEs may go to New York in the
autumn to see the contest for the America Cup, says: “There will be
better racing on the Clyde than there was last year. Let the PRINCE
come north at midsummer this year.” Wery likely the race on the
Clyde will be a good one. But our Scottish º forgets
that a visit to the United States on the part of H.R.H. would be to
the advantage of two races—the American and the British. . It would
be sure to cause good feeling on either side of the Atlantic. Why
should not Caledonia wait?

“stagger for the dagger” (i.e.

that this laborious form of under-
aduate wit, or “wagger,” is
oomed to dy “extigger.”
It is inevitable that the would-
be smart business person, when

It is inevitable that, when’ARRY

with “So long.”
It is inevitable that, when a
young City man desires to express
his disapproval of any individual
or thing, he will dismiss it as

It is inevitable, if you make

Second Counsel. Quite so, my lord; that is a conclusion that would
be accepted by persons of the most ordinary intelligence.
First Counsel. But as a matter of fact, the name to which I refer
is certainly neither Bhown nor BRowNE. I will submit the paperto
your lordship.
The Judge (after perusing the slip which has been handed to him
by an usher). Dear me! I am greatly surprised!
Foreman of the Jury. May we, my lord, learn the name?
First Counsel. So far as I am concerned, I shall be only too pleased
#. allow * Gentlemen of the Jury to have the fullestinformation on
e point.
Second Counsel. If I object, it is not because I have not the greatest
confidence in the Jury's discretion, but simply as amatter of principle.
but if my learned friend objects I have no wish to. F. the point
further. (Turning to Witness.) And now, where did you meet this
person whose name we have arranged to leave undiscovered?
Witness. Perhaps you will allow me to write the locality on a
piece of paper and pass it round?
The Judge. I think we may do that.
First Counsel. As your Lordship pleases. (Course suggested
pursued.) And now, have you ever seen any one else on the subject?
Witness. Certainly. (Produces a scroll.) Here is a list. I have
urposely written their names in shorthand, so that they may only
É. recognised by those who have a knowledge of PITMAN's method
The Judge. Certainly, - -
First Counsel. And that, my Lord, is my case. [Sits down.
The Judge. And now, Gentlemen, before we proceed further, I
would like to make a suggestion. When we commenced this trial we
arranged that the names of the Plaintiff and Defendant should not
be made public. Since then it seems to me that we should learn
them. What do you say, Gentlemen? - - -
Foreman of the Jury. 'We share your Lordship's curiosity.
The Judge (addressing Counsel). You hear.
First Counsel (after consultation with his opponent). My Lord,
I need scarcely say that, both my friend and myself are most
anxious to meet the wishes of your Lordship. , But as this is a
point of great importance to our clients, we should like to have an
opportunity of consulting them. No doubt the names asked for
might only have a limited circulation—be known only to your
Lordship and the Gentlemen of the Jury. , Still there are objections
to even so partial a publication as I have shadowed forth which make
it most desirable that we should have an opportunity of giving the
matter our fullest consideration. Perhaps we might adjourn until
to-morrow morning P , . -
The Judge. Oh, certainly, certainly. -- - -

A COMING CHARGE.
(Prematurely Communicated by our
Prophetic Reporter.)
GENTLEMEN of the Jury, for the
last couple of years or so you have
no doubt read any number of de-
nunciations of the conduct of the
man whose actions you are now
about to investigate. You have
heard him abused right and left.
You have seen pictures of him, in
which he has been held up to
scorn and public ridicule. You
have heard it announced in all
quarters that he is a scoundrel
and a thief. And as this has
been the case, Gentlemen of the
Jury, it is my duty tº tell you
that you must put aside the re-
collection of these attacks. You
must treat, the prisoner before
#" as if he were immaculate.
n fact you must lay aside all
§ and give the man a
air trial; and, Gentlemen, it is
my duty (sanctioned by precedent)
to have the pleasure of informin
you that I am sure vou :#;
ſes, Gentlemen of the . Jury,
having regard to all the circum-
stances of the case, I repeat, I
am sure you will !
At the National Liberal Club, on
Wednesday, Lord RoseBERy told
the companythey were not dancing
on a volcano. That may be true,
but it is equally true that the
Government, in proposing to re-
mit the sixpenny duty on whiskv,
are riding for a fall in (or, shall

A MAY MEETING.
THEY met in a cake-shophard by the Strand,
He in black broadcloth, and she in silk.
She had a glass of “fizz” in her hand,
He had a bun and a cup of milk.
She had a sunshade of burnished crimson,
He had a brolly imperfectly furled,
And a pair of pince-nez with tortoiseshell
Tirns on.
He looked the Church, and she seemed the
World.
Tº sat on each side of a marble table,
is legs were curled round the legs of his
cnair.
Around them babbled a miniature Babel;
The sunlight gleamed on her coppery hair.
She held a crumpled Academy Guide,
Scored with crosses in bold blacklead;
A pile of leaflets lay at his side,
And hºwed a Report, which he gravely
read.
His shaven lip was pendulous, long,
Her mouth was a cherry-hued moue mutine,
His complacent, uncomely, strong,
Hers soft appetence sharpened with spleen.
Her eyes scale-glitter, his oyster-dim,
His *:::: mouth hardened, her small lips

He lºh" Čhurch, and she seemed the
Oriol.
“A holy spouter from Exeter Hall!”
(So she m as she *: her wine.)
“A butterfly in the Belial thrall
Of Wanity Fair, all tinkle and shine!”
So thought he as he crumbled his bun
And the impish spirit of genial fun
Hovered about them and mocked them both.
Mutual ignorance, mutual scorn, -
Revealed in glances aflamethough fleeting;
Such, in the glow of this glad May morn,
The inhuman spirit of mortal meeting.
The worm must disparage the butterfly,
The butterfly must despise the worm;
And Scorn, the purblind, will ne'er descry
A common bond, or a middle term.
Modish folly, factitious Art?
True, grave homilist, sadly true!
But Boanerges truculent, tart,
What of §. part that is played by you?
You denouncing the “Snare of Beauty,”
She affecting to feel its spell,—
Which falls shortest of human duty P
Shallow censor, can you quite tell?
Meanwhile the lilac is blithely budding,
And sweetly breatheth the nutty May,
The golden sunshine the earth is flooding,
And you—you echo the old, old bray
Of Boanerges. A broader greeting
Of brotherhood full, warm hearts, wide eyes
Mightlend a meaning to your “May Meeting”

Tuesday.—Pretty to see PRINCE ARTHUR drop down on GEORGE
Russell just now for ing
disrespectfully of SILoMro. That
eminent patriot, having in his
newly-assumed character of Patron
Saint of Japan, cross-examined
Edward GREY upon latest Treaty
negotiations, accused. Asquith of
nothing less than stealing a county.
“Filching” was precise word,
which has its equivalent in Slang
Dictionary in sneaking. Idea of
Home SecretaRY hovering over
the Marches in dead of night, and,
when he thought no one was look-
ing, picking up Monmouthshire,
and putting it in his coat-tail
ket, amused scanty audience.
ut SILoMIo really wrath. “Al-
ways Anti-English this Govern-
ment,” he exclaimed, with scornful
sweep of red right hand along line
of smiling faces on Treasury Bench.
“A stirring burst of British pa-
triotism,” GeoRGE RUSSELL cha-
racterised it. John BULL in
excelsis. The more notable since,
on reference to official record, he
found the Knight from Sheffield
was born in the United States,
and descended from the Pilgrim
Fathers.
“Which one?” inquired voice
from back bench, an inquiry very
properly disregarded. (A new
phrase this, SARK notes, for use by -
retired tradesmen, setting up to spend rest of useful lives in retire-
ment at Clapham or Camberwell. To trace their family tree back to
transplantation at period of Conquest, played out. Instead of
“Came over with the Conqueror,” newer, more picturesque, equally
historical to say, “Came over with the Pilgrim Fathers.”)
PRINCE ARTHUR not in mood for speculation of this kind. Cut to
the heart by remarks he suspected of slighting intent towards his
friend and colleague. In SILoMIo PRINCE ARTHUR has long learned
to recognise all the graces and all the talents. Apart from personal
consideration, he feels how much the Party owe to him for having
raised within its ranks the standard of culture and conduct. To have
him attacked, even in fun, by an Under Secretary, was more than
he could stand. So, in gravest tone, with no flicker of a smile on his
expressive countenance, he declared that a more unfortunate speech
he had never heard. “If the hon. gentleman intends,” he added,
“to take a considerable part in debate, I would earnestly recom-
mend him either to change the character of his humour, or entirely
to repress the exhibition.’
Beautiful! In its way, all things considered, best thing PRINCE
ARTHUR has done this Session. House grinned; but two big hot
tears * down cheek of SILoMio, making deep furrows in the
War Daunt.
“That's tit for tat with GEoRGIE, RussELL,” said HERBERT
GARDNKR, to Solicitor-GENERAL, with vague recollection of a
historic phrase.
“Quite perfect,” said Lockwood. “But what a loss the stage
has sustained by PRINCE ARTHUR taking to politics? Tried both
myself and know something about it.” Business done.—An eight
Plling Peeler
Thursday.—TANNER's curiosity inconveniently uncontrollable.
At end of sitting given up to Scotland no one, thinking about
CoMMANDER-IN-CHIEF or TANNER either. Successive divisions had
carried sitting far beyond midnight, that blessed hour at which, in
ordinary circumstances, debate stands adjourned. Quarter of an hour
occupied in dividing on question whether they should divide on amend-
ment. Proposal affirmed; another quarter of an hour spent in fresh
division. Nothing possible further to be done, Members streamed
forth, scrambling for cabs in Palace Yard. Conybeah E in charge of
a Bill dealing with false alarms of fire, managed to get it through
Committee unopposed. Members little recked how near they were to
real alarm of worse than fire.
Twenty minutes earlier, when last division taken, over 330
Members filled. House. . Now the tide ebbed; only the thirty odd
Members in their places jealously watching SPEAKER running through
Orders of the Day. TANNER bobbing up and down on bench like
parched pea. Heard it somewhere whispered that Duke of CAM-
BRIDGE, worn out with long campaign, about to unhelm, unbuckle
his sword, hang up his dinted armour. TANNER feels he can't go to
Phantasy. Not a
“That this House
Then TANNER blurts out the inquiry, “Is it
true?” “Order!, order!”, says
the SPEAKER. Well, if they didn't
like the question in the form he
had first put it, he would try
again.
“I would ask,” he said, º:
conditional mood as least likely to
hurt anyone's feelings, “whether
a member of the Royal Family
# who has really” (most desirous of
not, putting it too, strongly, but
a really you know) “been drawing
; public money too long is going to
retire?”
“Order! order!” roared the few
Members present.
, “I would ask that question,”
repeated TANNER, still in the con-
ditional mood, but nodding confi-
dentially all round. -
The Blameless BARTLEY happily
at post of duty. Broke in with
protest. SPEAKER ruled question
; out of order. But the goodTANNER
came back like a bad sixpence.
“Is his Royal Highness going
to retire?” he insisted, getting red-
der than ever in the face. “Order!
order!” shouted Members in chorus.
Thus encouraged, TANNER sang out
2 the solo again, “Is his Royal High-
iness going to retire?”
That was his question. The
Rossal SPEAKER, distinctly differing,
upon Itossa: affirmed “The question is that the
House do now adjourn; ” which it did straightway, leaving Dr.
TANNER to go to a sleepless bed haunted by an unanswered question.
“What I should like,” said Lieut.-General Sir FREDERIck WEL-
LINgtoN FitzWygram, who served in the Crimea with H.R.H., has
been in command of the Cavalry Brigade at Aldershot, and in other
positions come in personal contact with the CoMMANDER-IN-CHIEF,
“What I should like,” he repeated reflectively, stroking his chin,
“would be the opportunity, enjoyed from a safe distance, of hearing
the Dook personally reply to TANNER's interrogation.”
Business done.—Wrangle all night round Scotch Committee.
Friday.—SQUIRE sat through dull morning sitting listening with
air of pathetic resignation to Members talking round Budget. QUIL-
TFR led off with prodigiously long paper on the Art of Brewing Beer.
Seems they fill up the cup with all kinds of mysterious ingredients.
BRookfield, looking round and observing both Joseph and JEsse
absent, whispered in ear of sympathetic Chairman that Birmingham
has reputation in the Trade of making and drinking beer containing
minimum of malt, maximum of sugar, and warranted to do the
greatest damage to the system. SQUIRE, momentarily waking up
from mournful mood, observed that Birmingham is also head
quarters of Liberal Unionism. Might be nothing in coincidence, but
there it was. RASCH posed as the distressed agriculturist. Joki M
tried to walk on both sides of road at same time, and Government
got majority of 24. Business done.—Budget Resolutions agreed to.

every green from John o'Groats to Airlie it
remains silent in the mouth of player and

As long as there is plenty of acreage for the

ExAMPLE II.-‘‘PALMAM QUI MERUIT FERAT.”
THE POET AND HIS INTERWIEWERS.
I Do not dwell in a back-attic with the windows lº up with
brown § neither do I wallow up to my eyes in a litter of manu-
script with flue on the carpet and dust on all the furniture. If ye, or
the Public, have any such impression, ye are very much mistaken.
I may be a literary person and a prose-poet; but I live quite respect-
ably, and have everything handsome about me. Come and see!
Ye will find the doorsteps freshly scoured, and the door-handle
§§ polished—which ye will make a note of after ye have rung
e Dell.
A trim parlourmaid—whom ye will allude to as “a neat-handed
PHYLLIs”—will open the door, and request ye to wipe your dirty
boots upon the doormat in the passage—which ye are expected to
mention as the “spacious entrance hall.”. . -
I shall stand on the threshold of my dining-room, and receive ye
with as much surprise as if the visit were not by previous appoint-
ment; shall accompany ye through all my rooms, and tellye, in:
teresting facts about the china and the chimney ornaments. I shall
not object to your bringing a camera and taking views of my “cosy
corner” and my hat and umbrella-stand.
They are exactly like those of everybody else, so they are sure to be
pleasing to an art-loving Public.
Ye will find in the drawing-room the perfume of º flowers—
provided I do not forget to send out for some penny bunches of
violets beforehand—and ye can take a photograph of the cottage
iano and my pet canary (which usually has its habitation in the
#. as I loathe all birds—but this is not for publication).
I will show ye the stand of wax-flowers fashioned by my maternal
grandmother—which will give ye an opportunity of commenting upon
the heredity of genius in my talented family— and ye may peer into
the silver épergne that was presented to my Uncle at the Cattle Show
for a prize pig. Ye will probably think it necessary to make a copy
of the inscription.
In the study—to which I shall humorously allude as my “den"—
there is little, of general interest except my old carpet slippers,
Mayhap ye will point to a few pipes that lie on the mantelpiece; but
they are merely."properties,” for the public expects all striking
literary personalities to write with pipes in their mouths. -
Come to me! I fear ye not. It is ye who confer celebrity. I
know ye so well. I shall follow ye out into the garden, and ye shall
carry stylographs in your waistcoat pockets, and I will relate to ye
my early literary experiences, give ye my theories on the Social
Question, and let ye kodak my child in its perambulator. -
I know ye; ye will convey a totally false impression of my views,
which I shall have to write to all the leading journals to correct. , Ye
will force me into the publicity and self-advertisement from which
my sensitive soul shrinks. Ye will describe the insides of my rooms,
for the benefit of the buzzing swarm which has hitherto shown no
overwhelming curiosity concerning the insides of my works.
Still, I do not mind your coming, provided that ye give me an
opportunity of revising a proof of the interview. Ye are necessary
Ilulsances.

such growing on you, my dear Loung ER,” quoth Sir DRURioLANus,

suffering from wintry blasts in stalls envies Vulcan rubbing his
hands and warming himself at Bonnard-Philémon's fire. Such a
night in May is enough to knock any piece to shivers. The con-

SEPPILLI; and for the second, Beaming Bevignani.

TheRE is only one Parish Council in England which is presided
over by a lady. Her name is JANE SHARESPEARE, and she rules the

will be found by her councillors that JANE hath a way with her, and
thus she will be brought into line with

That Alderman HULTon should harness his colt on,
And drive o'er the road between Bury and Bolton.
The chock-holes and paving are terrible—very,
And he may find his tomb e'er he comes back to Bury.
THERE was a gas explosion the other day in Dublin at the house of
a Mr. Atock. The report states that Mr. ATock's injuries were
dressed and he and his family afterwards left for the house of Mr.
Atock senior, at Phibsborough. , Phoebus, what a name! As the

WHAT is “dockisation”? Whatever it is, they have been
debating upon it at Bristol, and the proceedings are described as
“decidedly lively.” The protagonists were Mr. DE RIDDER and
Alderman PRocroR BAKER.
Dockisation, I think, is a question of docks,
And at Bristol it lately gave rise to hard knocks.

ExAMPLE II.-‘‘PALMAM QUI MERUIT FERAT.”
THE POET AND HIS INTERWIEWERS.
I Do not dwell in a back-attic with the windows pasted up with
brown paper, neither do I wallow up to my eyes in a litter of manu-
script with flue on the carpet and dust on all the furniture. If ye, or
the Public, have any such impression, ye are very much mistaken.
I may be a literary person and a prose-poet; but I live quite respect-
ably, and have everything handsome about me. Come and see!
Ye will find the doorsteps freshly scoured, and the door-handle
§§ polished—which ye will make a note of after ye have rung
e Dell.
A trim parlourmaid—whom ye will allude to as “a neat-handed
PHYLLIs”—will open the door, and request ye to wipe your dirty
boots upon the doormat in the passage—which ye are expected to
mention as the “spacious entrance hall.” -
I shall stand on the threshold of my dining-room, and receive ye
with as much surprise as if the visit were not by previous appoint-
ment; shall accompany ye through all my rooms, and tell ye in:
teresting facts about the china and the chimney ornaments. shall
not object to your bringing a camera and taking views of my “cosy
corner” and my hat and umbrella-stand.
They are exactly like those of everybody else, so they are sure to be
pleasing to an art-loving Public.
Ye will find in the drawing-room the perfume of many flowers-
provided I do not forget to send out for some penny bunches of
violets beforehand—and ye can take a photograph of the cottage
piano and my pet canary (which usually has its habitation in the
kitchen, as I loathe all birds—but this is not for publication).
I will show ye the stand of wax-flowers fashioned by my maternal
grandmother—which will give ye an opportunity of commenting upon
the heredity of genius in my talented family— and ye may peer into
the silver épergne that was presented to my Uncle at the Cattle Show
for a prize pig. Ye will probably think it necessary to make a copy
of the inscription.
In the study—to which I shall humorously allude as my “den”—
there is little of general interest except my old carpet slippers,
Mayhap ye will point to a few pipes that lie on the mantelpiece; but
they are merely. “properties,” for the public expects all striking
literary personalities to write with pipes in their mouths. -
Come to me! I fear ye not. It is ye who confer celebrity. I
know ye so well. I shall follow ye out into the garden, and yeshall
carry stylographs in your waistcoat pockets, and I will relate to ye
my early literary experiences, give ye my theories on the Social
Question, and let ye kodak my child in its perambulator, -
I know ye; ye will convey a totally false impression of my views,
which I shall have to write to all the leading journals to correct. , Ye
will force me into the ºliº and self-advertisement from which
my sensitive soul shrinks. Ye will describe the insides of my rooms,
for the benefit of the buzzing swarm which has hitherto shown no
overwhelming curiosity concerning the insides of my works.
Still, I do not mind your coming, provided that ye give me an
opportunity of revising a proof of the interview. Ye are necessary
nulsances.

Opening of Opera. Monday, May 13.-Crowded house. Grand
Otello Co. unlimited. The Orchestra has been sunk four feet, thus
giving Stalls clear view of stage. DRURIolanus proposes a puzzler
‘‘ Orchestra lowered,” he says, “yet all performers in it hired!”
Royal Highnesses present. DRURIolanus, taking happy musical
publishers' points of view, looks towards Roval Box and murmurs
“‘Royalties’ on music.” ALBANI surpasses herself as Desdemona :
quite wonder that Otello-Tamagno has the heart to smother her with
pillow after her song about the willow. Signor PEssINA as Iago:
rather a ponderous villain. Pecuniary operatic prospects exception-
ally good: at all events, possessing JEAN DE REszkE, TAMAGNO, and
BERTRAN, DRURIOLANUs has “three tenners” in hand to start with.

Admirable institution, an Admiralty yacht; reconciles one to Naval

Must try and remember this is a holiday, to get ozone and sleep—
especially sleep. - -
Cowes-SPENCER really very nautical. Talks of fast cruisers and
water-tube boilers all the time. Great on torpedo-destroyers. Says
the Haroc “goes twenty-five knots an hour.” Well then, why can't
HARcourt get up the same pace with our Bills? Wish he'd turn
into a Parliamentary Havoc, Mention this to SPENCEB, who laughs,
and says, “It’s the Opposition who indulge in twenty-five Nots an
hour.” Believe Spaniºn meansit as a joke. Turn in, and think of
HARCOURT and SPENCER's joke and Twin-Screw Cabinets and Water-
veto-boiler Bills. Wretched night!
Portland, Tuesday Morning.—Rather unfair of SPENCER. Now
he's got me safely on board, he's always trying to persuade me that
Navy wants more money spent on it. More money! Refer him to
HARCOURT, the “inexorable Jorkins.” Try to hide from SPENCER.
No good. He finds me behind a coil of rope on half-quarter-deck—
is it half-quarter-deck? ...Not sure, and don't like to ask—and begins
again. Seems he would like a few more millions for guns. Thought
we had heaps of guns. Talks about a ship he calls The Hecckler.
What a name! Reminds me of every political meeting I’ve ever
attended. Why will Lords of Admiralty give such names?'. SPENCER
explains- seems it's Hecla, not, Hecckler: Oh! All right. Fear
SFENCER begins to think me rather a land-lubber. Got me at an
advantage here. Wait till I take him to Newmarket Heath!
Off Plymouth.-Down in engine-room. , Tell, head stoker that
House of Lords is an effete institution. Stoker winks. Can he be a
Tory?. Tell him it's a ‘‘gilded prison.” Stoker seems surprised,
and asks, “Why I don't chuck it up, then?” Curious—no repartee
handy. ...And I am so good at them, generally. Must consult
“Fridoline,” traduit de l'Anglais de “Hap houghts,” to see
what would be a " repartee to a stoker.” . SPENCER won't
hear of it as bed; talks of “turning-in to his bunk.” What an
enthusiastic “First Lord” SPExceR does make! Thinking of First
Lord, wonder who'll be Last Lord? Go on wondering till dawn.
\; a. ºil. swabbing the deck makes! Wish I were i. at the

SPENCER replies it’s “as plain as a marlinspike.” Says Walworth
lost because not enough money spent on Navy, Assures me Navy
“much more important than Army; in fact, it’s the Predominant

me on some desolate isle—say Lundv. Won't do it. fribe a sailor;
Landed at Lizard. Off to town' Next time I want sea air, shall

0xFord DEGREES.—Certainly Messrs. DAN LENO and ALBERT
CHEVALIER should have, Masterships of Arts conferred, on them.
The “ Koces Stellarum”, at the Oxford Observatory (otherwise
Music Hall) are well worth hearing. Mr. BURNETT (J.P.) has just
issued a brochure on this Music-Astronomical subject, chiefly remark-
able for a brief essay, on “The Pantomimic Art,” by PAUI, MAR-
TINETTI, whose right to speak, on such a theme, as an authority,
may be arrived at by any one who sees this most artistic pantomimist
in a short melodramatic piece—a piece which thoroughly tells its
own tale without words—now being performed nightly at the Oxford.
It is admirable. If action can do so much, then why not a Shaks-
pearian play in action, and “the student” could read the words
to himself at home?, We, recommend the idea, to Mr. PAUL
MARTINETTI, and should advise him to re-arrange Don Quirote, as
“a piece without words,” for Mr. HENRY IRying, who, now looks
and acts the part to perfection; the piece itself might then be
of the actor, that is, -if action were substituted for its very poor
dialogue.
Politics A LA PERRYN MIDDLEwick.-The Radical wire-pullers
now regard the middle-class Walworth voters (for Mr. BAILFY) as
“Shop 'uns,” and the county division which returned Colonel
WILLIAMS as “inferior Dosset”!

TINETTI, whose right to speak, on such a theme, as an authority,
may be arrived at by any one who sees this most artistic pantomimist
in a short melodramatic piece—a piece which, thoroughly tells its
own tale without words—now being performed nightly at the Oxford.
It is admirable. If action can do so much, then why not a Shaks-
ian play in action, and “the student” could read the words
to himself at home?, We, recommend the idea to Mr. PAUL
MARTINETTI, and should advise him to re-arrange Don Quirote, as
“a piece without words,” for Mr. HENRY IRying, who, now looks
and, acts, the part to perfection; the piece itself might then be

dark-eyed, and animated; she holds a scarlet parasol. MURIEL
is eighteen; she has very fair hair, parted with puritanical

turned out so well! It is
rather hard to have made
“a good match,” as they
say, without intending it.
Of course, I never re-
proach him.
Muriel. No; you have
been very nice about it.
Viola. ALBERT is per-
fectly happy, playing at
being a country gentle-
man. He was so amazed
to find there were real
ducks and fowls in the
country—and buttercups!

Muriel. I am sure you would, dear. You have dropped your

Viola. Dear MURIEL, it is so nice to have you here. You are so
calm, and soothing, and decorative, and you never take anyone away
from anyone else!
Muriel. I think I have been rather unfortunate lately, Viola.
No one seems to like me but middle-aged married men—often, too,
with whiskers! -
Viola. You mean poor Mr. AveHIDGE” He has been married so
long that he has forgotten all about it. To-night CLAUDE Mignon is
coming to stay with us. He is the most accomplished, idiot in
London. He sings, plays, paints, º games, flirts—I think his
flirting, though, has rather gone off. It is getting mechanical. º

with the world before him, who would look up to me as an inspiration

TO A COUNTRY HOST.
(A Candid Answer to a Hospitable Invitation.)
You're kind enough to bid me spend
The “week-end” at your country seat,
You offer tennis and a friend
You feel I'm sure to like to meet.
I hope you will not think me rude—
You're very kind to ask me down—
But if the simple truth be told,
I much prefer to stay in town.
You tell me that the ground is bare,
And only gets by slow degrees
vered from our Arctic spell,
That leafless still are all the trees.
Well, here, in spite of smoke and soot,
And all the bustle and the hum
Of men and things, we don't await
The Spring—because the Spring has come.
Each morning as I go to work
I take my 'bus to Marble Arch,
And thence amid a wealth of flowers,
And air perfumed with odours, march
To Hyde Park Corner. Tell me where—
I honestly should like to know—
The much belauded “country” can
Produce a comparable show?
Our grass is green, though yours is brown.
On every tree the lovely bud
To leave such joys I can't cynsent,
Too great a struggle it would be,
But just to show you don't resent
These lines—come up and stay with me !

House of Commons, Monday, May 13.—“Well,” said the Mem-
ber for the Otley, division of Yorkshire, “I suppose I’ve gone
through as many vicissitudes as most men. First I was a BARRAN,
now I'm a baronite. Really, I don't know but what, if they’d made

Incursion of the Pirate Peer effectively managed. Those old
campaigners. GEorgº CuRzoN and St. JoHN BRodRICK, took the
business in hand. The thing was to be a great surprise. Accord-
ingly, took the SPEAKER into confidence, also the SQUIRE of
MALwoop (The Little Minister, MACFARLANE, who has just been
reading BARRIE, calls him), PRINCE ARTHUR, Joseph, and a score or
two others." The Pirate"Peer was to come down in hansom at

BRODRick, who likes to do the thing º: suggested that

CUBzoN liked idea, but thought it would attract inconvenient atten-
tion. Finally compromised by arrangement that cabby should tie
bit of black ribbon on his whip. Effect symbolic without being
obtrusive.
Everything went off excellently. Not a hitch in the arrangements.
Whilst questions still going on GEORGE CURzoN, with frcck-coat
lightly but flºº. over a belt teeming with pistols, saun-
tered in from lobby. Glanced carelessly round House. Accidentally,
as it were, placed himself between unsuspecting Sergeant-at-Arms

At preconcerted signal BRODRICK jº.; bustled down
to Front Opposition Bench. Attention of Members thus attracted,
the Pirate Peer followed, strode with firm, step down House.
“Just as if he were walking the plank,” said DoNALD CURRIE,
looking on admiringly. Before, House knew what had happened,
there he sat, smiling and blushing, between those pillars of Law
and Order, JoE and CourTNEY. ever since Parliaments began
had Éritish Constitution received such a staggering blow. SAGE
of QUEEN ANNE's GATE, whilst anxious to see destruction of House
of Lords, is not disposed to have stray fragments incorporated
with fabric of Commons. Called SPEARER's attention to presence in
their midst of the Pirate Peer. Asked what they were going to do
with him?
An anxious moment. GEORGE CURzoN tugged nervously at the

Pirate Peer to withdraw below Bar whilst

The Spring—because the Spring has come.

Too great a struggle it would be,

House of Commons, Monday, May 13.—“Well,” said the Mem-
ber for the Otley, division of Yorkshire, “I suppose I've gone
through as many.vicissitudes as most men. First I was a BARRAN,
now I’m a baronite. Really, I don't know but what, if they'd made
me an earl, I wouldn't go and sit in the House of Lords. Not
because, as good Radical, I don't despise them, but just to give
them advantage of my company, and place in their way a useful
example. Instead of which, here's Wolm ER become Earl of
SELBoRNR, and insists upon continuing to sit with us!”
Incursion of the Pirate Peer effectively managed. Those old
campaigners; GForgº CuRzon and St. John BRodRICK, took the
business in hand. The thing was to be a great surprise. Accord-
ingly, took...the SPEAKER, into confidence, also the Squire of
MAI woop (The Little Minister, MACFARLANE, who has just been
reading BARRIE calls him), PRINCE ARTHUR, Joseph, and a score or
two others." The Pirate"Peer was to come down in hansom at
“YEs. The EE Flights of STAiks 1"
to the teeth, standing at fifty paces nearer entrance to House cf
Commons.
BRodrick, who likes to do the thing º: suggested that
the Pirate Peer, should fly a black flag out of port-hole at top of cab.
CUBzoN liked idea, but thought it would attract inconvenient atten-
tion. Finally compromised by arrangement that cabby should tie
bit of black ribbon on his whip. Effect symbolic without being
obtrusive.
Everything went off excellently. Not a hitch in the arrangements.
Whilst questions still going on GEORGE CURzoN, with frcck-coat
lightly but ; buttoned over a belt teeming with pistols, saun-
tered in from lobby. Glanced carelessly round House. Accidentally,
as it were, placed himself between unsuspecting Sergeant-at-Arms
and º #. giving entrance to House. If the armed official
attacked Pirate Peer it should be across his (CURzoN's) body.
At preconcerted º BRODBIck rapidly entered; bustled down
to Front Opposition Bench. Attention of Members thus attracted,
the Pirate Peer followed, strode with firm, step down House.
“Just as if he were walking the plank,” said Donald Currie,
looking on admiringly. Before, House knew what had happened,
there he sat, smiling and blushing, between those pillars of Law
and Order, JoE and CourTNEY. ever since Parliaments began
had Éritish Constitution received such a staggering blow. SAGE
of QUEEN ANNE's GATE, whilst anxious to see destruction of House
of Lords, is not disposed to have stray fragments, incorporated
with fabric of Commons. Called SPEARER's attention to presence in
their midst of the Pirate Peer. Asked what they were going to do
with him?
An anxious moment. GEORGE CURzoN tugged nervously at the
arsenal scarcely concealed under his frock coat. St. John BRod-
Rick involuntarily stretched forth his hand in direction of Mace.
Suppose he were to seize it, sweep, the ry Bench clear at a
blow, whilst GEORGE CUBzoN, with pistol in either hand, and
dagger between his teeth, let fly a volley or two P. We might have

Pirate Peer to withdraw below Bar whilst

story of the man in Wales who trudged seventy miles a day, includ-
ing the diurnal ascent of a mountain 7,000 feet high, sent thrill of

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“LONDON AND LIVERPOOL–LITTLE
AND GOOD.”
IT appears that the very excellent proposal
of amalgamating all the local branches of
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children in one national association is meet-
ing with some opposition in Liverpool. Says
the Courier of that important locality, “It
was Liverpool which educated London in the
matter of child-protection, and probably the
Londºners could still learn in Liverpool many
ractical lessons. And just when Liverpool
is about to be trebled in extent, and have its
Kºlº. largely increased, seems a singu-
arly inappropriate time to subordinate the
city to London.” From this it would appear
that Liverpool in its growth is becoming, to
use a colloquialism, “too big for its boots.”
Surely the benefit of the children should be
the first consideration. What the size of
either Liverpool or London has to do with
that matter, it is difficult to say. No doubt
Londoners could learn much from their Liver-
pool brothers. But the lesson for the moment
is to discover how to best protect the little
ones. And that subject can only be mastered
by a display of goodwill and unselfishness on
both sides.

A BAS “THE CLUB SWEEP.”
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-Although you are a
humorist, there is a serious side to your
ch r. I want to appeal to that serious
side. I wish to complain of the prevalence in
all our West-End Co-operative Palaces of that
annual pest; appropriately called “the Club
Sweep.” should it be allowed to
prosper? It is a disgrace to civilisation. I
know of no more painful sight than the picture
of old CROESUs paying the hall-porter to put
him down for a dozen places. I am delighted
when those twelve positions end in blanks, or
starters out of the running. And nearly as
unpleasant an incidentisthetableau of young
Jon Es taking a pound chance at the same
fatallottery. Put it down, Mr. Punch; put
it down. ... I repeat, “the Club Sweep” is un-
worthy of the civilisation of the close of the
nineteenth century. Once more, Sir, put it
down. Yours, most truly,
AN OLD MEMBER of THE HERCULEs CLUB.
P.S.-Iamsure the thing is a mistake. Will
you believe it, I have put into my own sweep
for the last thirty-five years, and have never
drawn a starter! Same luck this season!
From the New Sarum Note-Book.
[Lord SALIs BURY “believes the SULTAN to be a
humane man.”— Speech at Bradford.]
LoRD SALISBURY believes—
That RICHARD THE THIRD was a remarkably
amiable man; especially kind to children.
That NERo was the gentlest creature that

That HENRY THE EIGHTH was a gentle, un-
assuming person; most religious and domes-
ticated; in fact, a model husband, and the
sort of man that “wouldn't harm a biby.”
ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
THE Hon. GEORGE CURzoN and Miss LETTER (U.S.A.) have been
married. The State of Illinois is indignant. The two facts are
more intimately connected than might be supposed. Four days after
the wedding a resolution was introduced into the State Legislature
of Illinois by a Mr. McCARTHY, requesting the daughters of Illinois
“not to º: the hand in marriage of any person who is not a
citizen of the United States, as we are of opinion that the daughters
of Illinois should be patriotic in their views, and should disregard
the title of any foreigner, and marry none but a citizen of the
United States.” It is stated that the resolution “was referred to
the Committee on Federal Relations.” Surely a Committee on
domestic relations or on titled relations would have been more
appropriate.
THE Illinois State Legislature obviously has novel ideas of its
legislative duties. Imagine an English County Council treating
seriously such fantastic rubbish as Mr. McCARTHY brought before
the law-makers of his Sºate. Would it not be more to the point to
look after the sons of Illinois, and to keep the hue of their resolution
up to the mark? If they are laggards in love, who shall blame the
British aristocrat for wooing with success the daughters of Illinois,
whom their compatriot suitors abandon? Or again, if titles are so
irresistible, an attraction to the fair, why not establish titles in
Illinois, and thus give the Earl of BANgs or the Marquis SALTonTALE
that seductive influence which is apparently lacking to plain
ZEDERIAH. B. BANgs, and to the ...rº K. SALTONTALE.
For it is obviously better that the daughters of Illinois should marry
than. that º should waste away with an unbridaled (let the
spelling pass) desire for a title.
At Oxford on Wednesday last the University beat Somerset by one
wicket, mainly owing to the admirable batting of Mr. H. D. G. Leve-
son Gower, popularly known as “The Shrimp.”
To the batsmen of Oxford, who looked very limp,
Father Neptune was kind when he gave them a'Shrimp:
For a Shrimp on the grass is most worthy of rhyme,
When he makes a firm stand, but gets runs all the time.
THE inhabitants of Christmas Street in Bristol want to have their
thoroughfare laid with wood pavi g. At present, according to an in-
dignant correspondent, ‘‘the pitching in the street is so bad that it
is positively dangerous for vehicular traffic... but the risk to life
and limb are entirely subservient.to, the parsimonious, policy of our
Bristol Sanitary Authority.” . Might I suggest Yule logs as an
appropriate pavement for Christmas Street?, Certainly this accident
policy of the Bristol Sanitary Authority ought to be allowed to lapse.
I GATHER from a letter in the Freeman's Journal that Bray is not
being well treated by the Bray Township Commissioners. “ º
is to march with the times,” says the writer, “and keep pace wit
the laudable efforts of our Tourist Development Association,” some-
thing must be done to improve, the walk round Bray Head. The
picture of Bray keeping pace and marching with the times by walk-
ing round its own head is too confusing for the intelligence of the
dense Saxon.
AN article in the Scotsman declares that “a great laxity of cos-
tume is characteristic of modern Oxford.” Straw hats and brown
boots appear to abound everywhere. It is added that “Bowlers are
already biº. to be preserved as relics of a bygone race.” This
will be glorious news for the Cambridge Eleven, for a merely pre-
served bowler cannot be very dangerous.
FROM a recent issue of the Freeman's Journal I extract the follow:
ing letter, which, it must be admitted, “makes both sides right.”
with a clearness that leaves nothing to be desired. Note, too, the
writer's natural vexation at the idea that he “assisted the con-
stable”:—
to the enditor of The FREEMAN.
114, Lower Clanbrassil Street, Dublin, May 14, 1895.
SIR,-With reference to your issue of the 13th inst., and the stolen tea
from one of the London and Northern-Western vans, I beg leave to state that
I in no way assisted the constable in the arrest of the prisoner, as you state;
neither was there any necessity for me, doing so, as he had sufficient help
along with him at the time. But I did help the driver of the waggon when
on the ground to recover his feet and get back to his waggon with the tea in
question. My reasons for doing so were as follows—first, being a van driver
myself, and I might say has been such all my lifetime, and knowing that
º. goods are stolen from any van in nine cases out of every ten the driver
of such a van has to make good the same and º under stoppages although
no fault of his. Secondly, when I came on the scene the driver of the
waggon seemed to be getting the worst of it, as the offender had two others
helping him. If someone did not interfere, therefore, under those circum-
stances and to protect the interest of my follow-workers, as I am always
ready to do, I interfered, and under no other.-Hoping you will kindly insert
this in your next issue and make both sides right, and thanking you for the
same, I remain your humble servant, HENRY PRENDERGAst.

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
THE Hon. GEORGE CURzoN and Miss LEITER (U.S.A.) have been
married. The State of Illinois is indignant. The two facts are
more intimately connected than might be supposed. Four days after
the wedding a resolution was introduced into the State Legislature
of Illinois by a Mr. McCARTHY, requesting the daughters of Illinois
“not to accept the hand in marriage of any person who is not a
citizen of the United States, as we are of opinion that the daughters
of Illinois should be patriotic in their views, and should disregard
the title of any foreigner, and marry none but a citizen of the
United States.” It is stated that the resolution “was referred to
the Committee on Federal Relations.” Surely a Committee on
domestic relations or on titled relations would have been more
appropriate.
THE Illinois State Legislature obviously has novel ideas of its
legislative duties. Imagine an English County Council treating
seriously such fantastic rubbish as Mr. McCARTHY brought before
the law-makers of his S.ate. Would it not be more to the point to
look after the sons of Illinois, and to keep the hue of their resolution
up to the mark? If they are laggards in love, who shall blame the
British aristocrat for wooing with success the daughters of Illinois,
whom their compatriot suitors abandon? Or again, if titles are so
irresistible, an attraction to the fair, why not establish titles in
Illinois, and thus give the Earl of BANgs or the Marquis SALtonTALE
that seductive influence which is apparently lacking to plain
ZEDERIAH. B. BANGs, and to the ºr ºfJonATHAN K. SALTONTALE.
For it is obviously better that the daughters of Illinois should marry
than. that they should waste away with an unbridaled (let the
spelling pass) desire for a title.
At Oxford on Wednesday last the University beat Somerset by one
wicket, mainly owing to the admirable batting of Mr. H. D. G. Leve-
son Gower, popularly known as “The Shrimp.”
To the batsmen of Oxford, who looked very limp,
Father Neptune was kind when he gave them a'Shrimp:
For a Shrimp on the grass is most worthy of rhyme,
When he makes a firm stand, but gets runs all the time.
The inhabitants of Christmas Street in Bristol want to have their
thoroughfare laid with wood paying. At present, according to an in-
dignant cºrrespondent, ‘‘the pitching in the street is so bad that it
is positively dangerous for vehicular traffic ... but the risk to life

A BAS “THE CLUB SWEEP.”
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-Although you are a
humorist, there is a serious side to your
character. I want to appeal to that serious
side. I wish to complain of the prevalence in
all our West-End Co-operative Palaces of that
annual pest, appropriately called “the Club
Sweep.” Why should it be allowed to
prosper? It is a disgrace to civilisation. I
know of no more painful sight than the picture
of old CROESUs paying the hall-porter to put
him down for a dozen places. I am delighted
when those twelve positions end in blanks, or
starters out of the running. And nearly as
unpleasant an incidentis the tableau of young
Jon Es taking a pound chance at the same
fatallottery. Put it down, Mr. Punch; put
it down. ... I repeat, “the Club Sweep” is un-
worthy of the civilisation of the close of the
nineteenth century. Once more, Sir, put it
own. Yours, most truly,
AN OLD MEMBER of THE HERCULEs CLUB.
P.S.-Iamsure the thing is a mistake. Will
you believe it, I have put into my own sweep
for the last thirty-five years, and have never
drawn a starter! Same luck this season!

SIR,-With reference to your issue of the 13th inst., and the stolen tea
from one of the London and Northern-Western vans, I beg leave to state that
I in no way assisted the constable in the arrest of the prisoner, as you state;
neither was there any necessity for me, doing so, as he had sufficient help
along with him at the time. But I did help the driver of the waggon when
on the ground to recover his feet and get back to his waggon with the tea in
question. My reasons for doing so were as follows—first, being a van driver
myself, and I might say has been such all my lifetime, and knowing that
º. goods are stolen from any van in nine cases out of every ten the driver
of such a van has to make º: same and be put under stoppages although
no fault of his. Secondly, when I came on the scene the driver of the
waggon seemed to be getting the worst of it, as the offender had two others
helping him. If someone did not interfere, therefore, under those circum-
stances and to protect the interest of my follow-workers, as I am always
ready to do, I interfered, and under no ºther.-Hoping you will kindly insert

Especially interesting to Minister of -
Agriculture. Being a man of taste,
Major had installed the insects in
dainty bon-bon box; swung it lightly
between forefinger and thumb as he
inquired what HERBERT GARDNER
meant to do about it? “Will the
#. hon. gentleman,” he said.
“have consignments of peas coming
from America marked as such, and
#. in bond, so that the bugs may
evelop there, and not in the British
market garden?”
At this way of putting it, SQUIRE

of the ExCHEQUER bugs in bond
suggested new field of taxation.
Made a note of it.
The GRAND YouNG GARDNER
smiled at the claims of long descent
put forward by RASCH on behalf of

ciliously, “Known the creature all

“I don't care,” said ToMLINson, “whether its American pea-bugs
or the pea and bean weevil. What I do say is that no man has any
business to bring such things with him into the social circle.”
“I may have been Rash,” said the Major humbly.
“You are,” said ToMLINson tartly.
Business done.—Coolness sprung up between ToMLINson and Major
RAsch. Budget Bill read second time.
Friday.—“Pity the sorrows of the poor postman, whose wander-
ing steps has brought him to your door.” Thus KEARLEY, in a long
speech, from which it appeared that if there is a down-trodden
fellow-creature whose state looks hopeless, it is the postman. The
story of the man in Wales who trudged seventy miles a day, includ-
ing the diurnal ascent of a mountain 7,000 feet high, sent thrill of
horror through House. KEARLEY subsequently explained he meant
700 feet high. But that a detail. Seven seems to be this man's
fateful number, for his pay is seven shillings a week—a shilling a
day, including the mountain.
ABNoLD MoRLEY, on other hand, showed that the lot of the post-
man is truly idyllic. Handsomely paid when on º and

IT appears that the very excellent proposal |sº *:::::A;
of amalgamating all the local branches of -
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children in one national association is meet-
ing with some opposition in Liverpool. Says
the Courier of that important locality, “It

that Liverpool in its growth is becoming, to
use a colloquialism, “too big for its boots.”
Surely the benefit of the children should be
the first consideration. What the size of
either Liverpool or London has to do with

At Oxford on Wednesday last the University beat Somerset by one

Father Neptune was kind when he gave them a'Shrimp:

A BAS “THE CLUB SWEEP.”
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-Although you are a
humorist, there is a serious side to your
character... I want to appeal to that serious
side. I wish to complain of the prevalence in
all our West-End Co-operative Palaces of that
annual pest, appropriately called “the Club
Sweep.” Why should it be allowed to
prosper? It is a disgrace to civilisation. I
know of no more painful sight than the picture
of old CROESUs paying the hall-porter to put
him down for a dozen places. I am delighted
when those twelve positions end in blanks, or
starters out of the running. And nearly as
unpleasant an incidentis the tableau of young
Jon Es taking a pound chance at the same
fatallottery. Put it down, Mr. Punch : put
it down. ... I repeat, “the Club Sweep” is un-
worthy of the civilisation of the close of the
nineteenth century. Once more, Sir, put it
down. Yours, most truly,
AN OLD MEMBER of THE HERCULES CLUB.
P.S.-Iamsure the thing is a mistake. Will
you believe it, I have put into my own sweep
for the last thirty-five years, and have never
drawn a starter! Same luck this season!

SIR,-With reference to your issue of the 13th inst., and the stolen tea
from one of the London and Northern-Western vans, I beg leave to state that
I in no way assisted the constable in the arrest of the prisoner, as you state:
neither was there any necessity for me, doing so, as he had sufficient help
along with him at the time. But I did help the driver of the waggon when
on the ground to recover his feet and get back to his waggon with the tea in
question. My reasons for doing so were as follows—first, being a van driver
myself, and I might say has been such all my lifetime, and knowing that
º goods are stolen #. any van in nine cases out of every ten the driver
of such a van has to make good the same and º under stoppages although
no fault of his. Secondly, when I came on the scene the driver of the
waggon seemed to be getting the worst of it, as the offender had two others
helping him. If someone did not interfere, therefore, under those circum-
stances and to protect the interest of my follow-workers, as I am always
ready to do, I interfered, and under no other.-Hoping }. will kindly insert
this in your next issue and make both sides right, and thanking you for the
same, I remain your humble servant, HENRY PRENDERGAst.

Especially interesting to Minister of
Agriculture. Being a man of taste,
Major had installed the insects in
dainty bon-bon box; swung it lightly
between forefinger and thumb as he
inquired what HERBERT GARDNER
meant to do about it? “Will the
#. hon... gentleman,” he said.
“have consignments of peas coming
from America marked as such, and
put in bond, so that the bugs may
develop there, and not in the British
market garden?”
At this way of putting it, SQUIRE

of THE Exchequer bugs in bond
suggested new field of taxation.
Made a note of it.
The GRAND YoUNG GARDNER
smiled at the claims of long descent
put forward by RASCH on behalf of
the tenants of his bon-bon box.
“Nothing new in it,” he said super-
ciliously. “Known the creature all
my official life. Your so-called
American pea-bug is nothing more
than the pea and bean weevil. Came

tural Department even now pub-
lishing leaflet describing manners
and customs of the early settler,

This hard; sorer still conduct of
“I may have been Rash.”
Members immediately near the Major. Began to sheer off, putting
him, so to speak, in quarantine.
“I don't care,” said ToMLINson, “whether its American pea-bugs
or the pea and bean weevil. What I do say is that no man has any
business to bring such things with him into the social circle.”
‘‘I may have been Rash,” said the Major humbly.
“You are,” said ToMLINson tartly.
Business done.-Coolness sprung up between ToMLINson and Major
RASCH. Budget Bill read second time.
Friday.—“Pity the sorrows of the poor postman, whose wander-
ing steps has brought him to your door.” Thus KEARLEY, in a long
speech, from which it appeared that if there is a down-trodden
fellow-creature whose state looks hopeless, it is the postman. The
story of the man in Wales who trudged seventy miles a day, includ-
ing the diurnal ascent of a mountain 7,000 feet high, sent, thrill of
horror through House. KEARLEY subsequently explained he meant
700 feet high. But that a detail. Seven seems to be this man's
fateful number, for his pay is seven shillings a week—a shilling a
day, including the mountain.
ARNoLD MoRLEY, on other hand, showed that the lot of the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“LONDON AND LIVERPOOL–LITTLE
AND GOOD.”
It appears that the very excellent proposal
of amalgamating all the local branches of
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children in one national association is meet-
ing with some opposition in Liverpool. Savs
the Courier of that important locality, “It
was Liverpool which educated London in the
matter of child-protection, and probably the
Londºners could still learn in Liverpool many
ractical lessons. And just when Liverpool
is about to be trebled in extent, and haye its
Fºlº largely increased, seems a singu-
arly inappropriate time to subordinate the
city to London.” From this it would appear
that Liverpool in its growth is becoming, to
use a colloquialism, “too big for its boots.”
Surely the benefit of the children should be
the first consideration. What the size of
either Liverpool or London has to do with
that matter, it is difficult to say. No doubt
Londoners could learn much from their Liver-
l brothers. But the lesson for the moment
is to discover how to best protect the little
ones. ...And that subject can only be mastered

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
THE Hon. GEORGE CURzoN and Miss LETTER (U.S.A.) have been
married. The State of Illinois is indignant. The two facts are
more intimately connected than might be supposed. Four days after
the wedding a resolution was introduced into the State Legislature
of Illinois by a Mr. McCARTHY, requesting the daughters of Illinois
“not to º: the hand in marriage of any person who is not a
citizen of the United States, as we are of opinion that the daughters
of Illinois should be patriotic in their views, and should disregard
the title of any foreigner, and marry none but a citizen of the
United States.” It is stated that the resolution “was referred to
the Committee on Federal Relations.” Surely a Committee on
domestic relations or on titled relations would have been more
appropriate.
THE Illinois. State Legislature obviously has novel ideas of its
legislative duties. Imagine an English County Council treating
seriously such fantastic rubbish as Mr. McCARTHY brought before
the law-makers of his State. Would it not be more to the point to
look after the sons of Illinois, and to keep the hue of their resolution
up to the mark? If they are laggards in love, who shall blame the
British aristocrat for wooing with success the daughters of Illinois,
whom their compatriot suitors abandon? Or again, if titles are so
irresistible, an attraction to the fair, why not establish titles in
Illinois, and thus give the Earl of BANGs or the Marquis SALTonTALE
that seductive influence which is apparently lacking to plain
ZEDERIAH. B. BANgs, and to the unadorned JonATHANK. SALTONTALE.
For it is obviously better that the daughters of Illinois should marry
than. that they should waste away with an unbridaled (let the
spelling pass) desire for a title.
At Oxford on Wednesday last the University beat Somerset by one
wicket, mainly owing to the admirable batting of Mr. H. D. G. Leve-
son Gower, popularly known as “The Shrimp.”

up to the mark? If they are laggards in love, who shall blame the
British aristocrat for wooing with success the daughters of Illinois,
whom their compatriot suitors abandon? Or again, if titles are so
irresistible, an attraction to the fair, why not establish titles in
Illinois, and thus give the Earl of BANGs or the Marquis SALTonTALE
that seductive influence which is apparently lacking to plain
ZEDERIAH. B. BANGS, and to the unadorned JonATHANK. SALTONTALE.
For it is obviously better that the daughters of Illinois should marry
than. that they should waste away with an unbridaled (let the
spelling pass) desire for a title.
At Oxford on Wednesday last the University beat Somerset by one
wicket, mainly owing to the admirable batting of Mr. H. D. G. Leve-
son Gower, popularly known as “The Shrimp.”
To the batsmen of Oxford, who looked very limp,
Father Neptune was kind when he gave them a'Shrimp:
For a Shrimp on the grass is most worthy of rhyme,
When he makes a firm stand, but gets runs all the time.
THE inhabitants of Christmas Street in Bristol want to have their
thoroughfare laid with wood pavi g. At present, according to an in-
dignant correspondent, “the itching in the street is so bad that it
is positively dangerous for vehicular traffic... but the risk to life
and limb are entirely subservient to the parsimonious, policy of our
Bristol Sanitary Authority.” . Might I suggest Yule logs as an
appropriate pavement for Christmas Street? º this accident
policy of the Bristol Sanitary Authority ought to be allowed to lapse.
I GATHER from a letter in the Freeman's Journal that Bray is not
being well treated by the Bray Township Commissioners. “If Bra
is to march with the times,” says the writer, “and keep pace wit
the laudable efforts of our Tourist Development Association,” some-
thing must be done to improve, the walk round Bray Head. The
picture of Bray ºf pace and marching with the times by walk-
i. º: its own head is too confusing for the intelligence of the
ense Naxon.
AN article in the Scotsman declares that “a great laxity of cos-
tume is characteristic of modern Oxford.” Straw hats and brown
boots appear to abound everywhere. It is added that “Bowlers are
already biº. to be preserved as relics of a bygone race.” This
will be glorious news for the Cambridge Eleven, for a merely pre-
served bowler cannot be very dangerous.
FROM a recent issue of the Freeman's Journal I extract the follow:
ing letter, which, it must be admitted, “makes both sides right.”
with a clearness that leaves nothing to be desired. . Note, too, the
writer's natural vexation at the idea that he “assisted the con-
stable”:—
To THE EDITOR or THE FREEMAN.
114, Lower Clanbrassil Street, Dublin, May 14, 1895.
SIR,-With reference to your issue of the 13th inst., and the stolen tea
from one of the London and Northern-Western vans, I beg leave to state that
I in no way assisted the constable in the arrest of the prisoner, as you state;
neither was there any necessity for me, doing so, as he had sufficient help
along with him at the time. But I did help the driver of the waggon when
on the ground to recover his feet and get back to his waggon with the tea in
question. My reasons for doing so were as follows—first, being a van driver
myself, and I might say has been such all my lifetime, and knowing that
º. goods are stolen from any van in nine cases out of every ten the driver
of such a van has to make good the same and be §. under stoppages although
no fault of his. Secondly, when I came on the scene the driver of the
waggon seemed to be getting the worst of it, as the offender had two others
helping him. lf someone did not interfere, therefore, under those circum-
stances and to protect the interest of my follow-workers, as I am always
ready to do, I interfered, and under no other.-Hoping you will kindly insert
this in your next issue and make both sides right, and thanking you for the
same, I remain your humble servant, HENRY PRENDERGAst.

BOOKMAKERS ON THE BEACH.
(A Sketch at a Sea-side Race-Meeting.)
Scene—The Sands at Baymouth, where some pony and horse races
are being run. By the Grand Stand, and under the wall q the
esplanade, about a dozen bookmakers, perched on old pac ºng-
cases, are clamouring with their customary energy. The public,
however, for some reason seems unusually deaf to their blandish-
ments and disinclined for speculation, and the bookmakers, after
shouting themselves hoarse with little or no result, are beginning
to feel discouraged.

form an accurate opinion.
OPERATIC NOTES.
Monday.-Crowded house: all charmed with, everything, and
everybody in Fra Diavolo. Somebody in grand tier so ecstatically
pleased, that, unable any longer to control impulsive movement, he
(or she) hurls into the air leather lorg.nette case, which, descending
at an angle, clears the Prince of WALEs's elbow by a few inches,
and startles musical enthusiast who, seated at corner of third row
of stalls, is at that moment wrapped up in the opera, and thus pro-
tected, against most external dangers. A thrill went through the
house ! is it a “B-o-m-b” bomb? BEvignani, pausing, biiton in
air, gives the horrorstruck singers and concealed
orchestra (to whom pause is inexplicable) a few
notes rest. Then corner (stall) man picks up lorg-
nette case, fortunately empty; whereupon the Bold
BEVIGNANI's bâton is once more in motion, and
everyone is “as they were.” ARIMond1 and Pn.
CoRSI earn a big eicore for duet and dance. Mr.
DAVID BISPHAM with Madame AMADI, as Milor' and
Miladi, speaking English and queer Italian, do
good service. Fra Diavolo-Lucia excellent, and
Miss MARIE ENGLE (who naturally quite under-
stood Milor' and Miladi when s ing Engelish)
a charming, sprightly Zerlina. Revivaldecided hit.
Wednesday.—WERDI's opera, Falstaff. Some
charming music in it; otherwise dull opera. Im-
possible to put Falstaff himself, singing or ing,
on any stage. Actor or singer invariably over-
weighted. ZELIE DE LUssan, looking like Jessica,
sings Anne Page's music charmingly. SHAKs-
PEARE created “sweet ANNE PAGE” the daughter
of Mrs. Page. Why then, in the opera, is she put
into the Fokd family? I refer to the “Characters” in the book of the
opera, where I find “Mistress Ford,” and “Anne, her daughter.”
GIULIA_RAvogli a sprightly Dame Quickly; PAULINE JöRAN a
lively Mistress Ford; and Signor DE LUCIA an amiable Fenton,
“with a song.”
Friday. - House not absolutely crowded to hear Carmen. Is
Carmen a bit “off” Yet nothing better than ormance of
ZELIE DE LUSSAN as gay and wicked heroine. Little Don José de
Lucia first-rate, and AnconA winning encore for old friend Toréador.
MARIE ENGLE excellent goody-goody contrast to bold, bad Carmen.
Police-constable Bevignani, báton in hand, severe when on the beat.

D. F. On the contrary, I have only

Curiously enough, this is my first voyage

D. F. Nothing simpler. Tradition, voilà tout. The English-

I find the º so rare in its own country. -
Int. Might I dare to ascribe such traditional views to the prejudice
of ignorance? Your Press, I believe, does not educate itself by
foreign travel.
D. F. I cannot speak for others, but personally, if I do not offend
the laws of courtesy by saying this in the city whose hospitality I
now enjoy, I detest your race. I regard you as insular.
Int. We cannot, of course, help being born on an island. But we
correct this defect by constant visits to the mainland, and from these
we have learnt a profound respect for the tastes of our neighbours.
D. F. I am greatly gratified by this. Nothing has impressed me
so favourably here as your cordial appreciation of our people.
I met a distinguished British novelist who was actually acquainted
with the literature of my own Provence!
Int. May I ask what other features of our comparatively inac-

D. F. Above all things else, the sinister silence of your city. On
the Stock Exchange, down º among vendors of journals,
you can hear a pin drop. Everywhere the taciturnity of the tomb.

D. F. Nothing has impressed me so deeply as the Great Wheel at
Earl's Court. It is a monument of national ardour and aspiration.
This, and Mr. STANLEY, and your guardsmen, and your way of
cooking meat, have left the most indelible impression upon my
sentiment and constitution. I dislike the last two of them.
Int. In cooking, we freely yield you the saucepan. But how has
our military given you offence?
D. F. I object to the size of its chest, and its manner of occu-
pying the pavement. , I have seen a guardsman, in Whitehall
against whom, in the heyday of my youth, I should indubitably
have projected my person. -
Int. It would have been a rash and perhaps irreparable act. But
tell me more. Kindly hold up once again the veracious mirror, that
we may see ourselves as others see us. We are so apt to be blind to

IN THE GRAND STAND.
A Glib Person, in a tall hat (as he picks his way up and down
the benches, the occupants
of which treat him with
tolerant indifference). I’m
not a bookmaker, ladies
and gentlemen; don't have
that impression of me for
a moment! I'm simply
an amateur, and an in-
dependent gentleman o'
means, like any of your-
selves. You ºw more
than I do. I don't come
'ere with any intention o'
winning your money—far
from it. I’m wishful to
settle and live among you.
I may eventually put up
as your member; and, if
so, when l take my place
in Parliament I shall be in
a position to testify that
the Baymouth people are
extremely cautious as to
the manner in which they
invest their money on 'orse-
racin'! Yes, I'm 'ere on
beyarf of the Sporting
League, just to prove how
free a meeting like this is
from the evils o' gambling.
I don't come 'ere to rob
yer. I want yer all to win.
I like to see yer bright and
shining faces around me;
I like the friverolity and
reckereation and the con-
viverality of the thing,
that’s all. I'll tell yer
how it is. I've a rich ole
aunt, and she puts fifty
pound into my 'ands, and
Fez, “Jacky,” she sez, “I
love those dear Baymouth
people, and I want you to
take this 'ere money and
lay it out among 'em in
moieties, and make 'em
rich and 'appy.” You can
see for yourselves. I've
no tickets and no parryfer-
nalia, excep' , this little
pocket-book, where I enter
any bets you honour me
with. Come, Miss, win a
air o' those three-and-sixpenny gloves at ChickFRELI's, the ex-
ayor's, to oblige me! Did I tread on your corn, Sir? I assure you
it was the last thing I intended. ..., “You knew I'd do it afore I'd
done?” ... Well, Sir, if you’ve sech a gift o' seeing into futoority as
that, why not make ºi. out of it now? Three to one bar one.
Kitty I'm barring. Thank you, Sir; 'alf-a-crown to seven and six
on Sportsman. I tell you candidly—you've got the winner. The
favourite won't win. Now, then, all you others, where's your Bay:
mouth pluck? I orfered you thirty to one Beeswing last race; and
you wouldn't take it. And Beeswing won, and you lost the chance
o making yer fortunes. Don't blame me if the same thing 'appens

get rid o' the money! (&c., &c.)

AT THE CLose of THE LAST RAcE.
Three horses have started; the favourite has led to the turn and
then bolted up the shingle, but, as the tide has come in and almost
covered the course, and the other two horses by declining to face
the water have let him in again, he wins after an erciting
‘inish, up to the girths in sea-water; and such bookmakers as
have succeeded in obtaining patronage are paying up with as
much cheerfulness as they can command.
First Bookmaker (to eager backer). Wait a bit, my boy, wait a bit,
the number hasn't gone up yet, my son. Where's your ticket—forty-
two P (His clerk refers to book.) That's Squibbs. I pay over

owerer, the local newspaper reports next day that “A number
of the sporting fraternity were in attendance to do business,
and apparently carried on a brisk and profitable trade”—
which only shows how difficult it is for the casual observer to
form an accurate opinion.
OPERATIC NOTES.
Monday.-Crowded house: all charmed with, everything, and
everybody in Fra Diavolo. Somebody in grand tier so ecstatically
pleased, that, unable any longer to control impulsive movement, he
(or she) hurls into the air leather lorg.nette case, which, descending
at an angle, clears the Prince of WALEs's elbow by a few inches,
and startles musical enthusiast who, seated at corner of third row
of stalls, is at that moment wrapped up in the opera, and thus pro-
tected, against most external dangers. A thrill went through the
house! is it a “B-0-m-b” bomb? BEvig NANI, pausing, biton in
air, gives the horrorstruck singers and concealed
orchestra (to whom pause is inexplicable) a few
notes rest. Then corner (stall) man picks up lorg-
nette case, fortunately empty; whereupon the Bold
BEVIGNANI's bâton is once more in motion. and
everyone is “as they were.” ARIMond1 and Pinº.
CoRSI earn a big eicore for duet and dance. Mr.
DAVID BISPHAM with Madame AMADI, as Milor" and
Miladi, speaking English and queer Italian, do
good service. Fra Diavolo-Lucia excellent, and
Miss MARIE ENGLE (who naturally quite under-
stood Milor’ and Miladi when speaking Engelish)
a charming, sprightly Zerlina. Revivaldecided hit.
Wednesday.—WERDI's opera, Falstaff. Some
charming music in it; otherwise dull opera. Im-
possible to put Falstaff himself, singing or 5 ing,
on any e. Actor or singer invariably over-
weighted. ZELIE DE LUssan, looking like Jessica,
sings Anne Page's music charmingly. SHAKs-
PEARE created “sweet ANNE PAGE” the daughter
- of Mrs. Page. Why then, in the opera, is she put
into the Foºd family?' I refer to the "characters” in the book of the
opera, where I find “Mistress Ford,” and “Anne, her daughter.”
GIULIA RAvogli a sprightly Dame Quickly; PAULINE JöRAN a
lively Mistress Ford; and Signor DE LUCIA an amiable Fenton,
“with a song.”
Friday. - House not absolutely crowded to hear Carmen. Is
better than performance of
Carmen a bit “off” Yet nothi
ZELIE DE LUss AN as gay and wicked heroine. Little Don José de
Lucia first-rate, and AnconA winning encore for old friend Toréador.
MARIE ENGLE excellent goody-goody contrast to bold, bad Carmen.
Police-constable BEVIGNANI, báton in hand, severe when on the beat.
In honour of QUEEN's Birthday, Sir DRURIolanus troupe-ing Il
Saturday.-Faust. “House full.” The Princess and Princesses
present, MEIBA's “Jewel song” a gem, M. PIANgon; whose
name, º, pronounced, suggests “Mr. PLAIN-song,” rather
ºcclesiastical than diabºlical, a highly-coloured but generally effec-
tive Mephis heles. Mdlle. BRAzzi appears to-night as “the new
woman” in of Siebel. “She rouses enthusiasm,” quoth
e §
WAGSTAFF, “no Siebel-lation.” Ereunt omnes.
THE DISCOVERY OF LONDON.
Interriewer. As a keen student of your fascinating works, permit
me to render to you my respectful homage.
Distinguished Foreigner in London. Certainly. Iobserve that you
speak the French of the capital with fluency.
Int. You flatter me. I am only an
ordinary journalist. Possibly you prefer
to converse in our local language?
D. F. On the contrary, I have only
recently acquired the Englishword, “Yes.”
Curiously enough, this is my first voyage
of discovery to your shores. I had, of
course, often heard of England, and your
literature is not unfamiliar to me. My
secretary reads to me the works of your
º º
popular poet, Robert BRowNING. º/\ſ.
Int, Do you not, with your–er—limited º */2
.*. if I may so say, of our lan- 4%
guage, nd that writer's meaning some- -
what obscure? - -
D. F. Oh no; for my secretary translates him into idiomatic
French verse at sight.
Int, M. Zola has also only recently discovered us. How do your
novelists find the necessary models for their English º: ?
D. F. Nothing simpler. Tradition, voilà tout. The English-
woman, with her large feet, projecting teeth, and execrable French—
we know her because we have . known her. It is not necessary
to have seen her in the flesh. Indeed, it is only a marvel to me that
I find the º so rare in its own country. - -
Int. Might I dare to ascribe such traditional views to the prejudice
of ignorance? Your Press, I believe, does not educate itself by
foreign travel.
D. F. I cannot speak for others, but personally, if I do not offend
the laws of courtesy by saying this in the city whose hospitality I
now enjoy, I detest your race. I regard you as insular.
Int. We cannot, of course, help being born on an island. But we
correct this defect by constant visits to the mainland, and from these
we have learnt a profound respect for the tastes of our neighbours.
D. F. I am greatly gratified by this. Nothing has impressed me
so favourably here as your cordial appreciation of our people,
I met a distinguished British novelist who was actually acquainted
with the literature of my own Provence! -
Int, May I ask what other features of our comparatively inac-
cessible island have attracted your notice?
D. F. Above all things else, the sinister silence of your city. On
the Stock Exchange, down . among vendors of journals,
you can hear a pin drop. Everywhere the taciturnity of the tomb.
Int. And what of our institutions and twoes?
D. F. Nothing has impressed me so deeply as the Great Wheel at
Earl's Court. It is a monument of national ardour and aspiration.
This, and Mr. STANLEY, and your guardsmen, and your way of
cooking meat, have left the most indelible impression upon my
sentiment and constitution. I dislike the last two of them.
Int. In cooking, we freely yield you the saucepan. But how has
our military given you offence?
D. F. I object to the size of its chest, and its manner of occu-
pying the pavement. , I have seen a guardsman, in Whitehall
against whom, in the heyday of my youth, I should indubitably
have projected my person.
Int. It would have been a rash and perhaps irreparable act. But
tell me more. Kindly hold up once again the veracious mirror, that
we may see ourselves as others see us. We are so apt to be blind to
our own national defects, unless the impartial observer, like yourself,
throws a flood of light upon our idiosyncrasies.
D. F. I should like a few more days in which to complete my
study, and verify my *...*. of your interesting city, Mean-
while, let me refer you to M. GABRIEL MoUREY's new work–Passé
le Détroit. The Ulysses of our century, he has gained a wide know-
ºf: of your race, having been afearless traveller in L'Underground,
and seen some of your most typical fogs. You may learn much from
him. He is r eagerly at home, where the thirst for books of
*: travel and exploration grows hourly. I wish you the good
y. Yes.





Trovatore's operatic colours at Windsor Castle. It ought to have
been, appropriately, Falstaff.

BOOKMAKERS ON THE BEACH.
(A Sketch at a Sea-side Race-Meeting.)
Scene—The Sands at Baymouth, where some pony and horse races
are being run. By the Grand Stand, and under the wallo the
esplanade, about a dozen bookmakers, perched on old packing-
cases, are clamouring with their customary energy. The public,
however, for some reason seems unusually deaf to their blandish-
ments and disinclined for speculation, and the bookmakers, after
shouting themselves hoarse with little or no result, are beginning
to feel discouraged.

OPERATIC NOTES.

everybody in Fra Diavolo. Somebody in grand tier so ecstatically
pleased, that, unable any longer to control impulsive movement, he
(or she) hurls into the air leather lorg.nette case, which, descending
at an angle, clears the Prince of WALEs's elbow by a few inches,
and startles musical enthusiast who, seated at corner of third row
of stalls, is at that moment wrapped up in the opera, and thus pro-
tected, against most external dangers. A thrill went through the
house ! is it a “B-o-m-b” bomb? BEvignaRI, pausing, biiton in
air, gives the horrorstruck singers and concealed
& orchestra (to whom pause is inexplicable) a few
*h notes rest. Then corner (stall) man picks uplºrg-
–º- a -ºs- nette case, fortunately empty; whereupon the Bold
- BEVIGNANI's bâton is once more in motion, and
everyone is “as they were.” ARIMondr and Pm.
CoRSI earn a big eicore for duet and dance. Mr.
DAVID BISPHAM with Madame AMADI, as Milor' and
Miladi, speaking English and queer Italian, do
good service. Fra Diavolo-Lucia excellent, and
Miss MARIE ENGLE (who naturally quite under-
stood Milor' and Miladi when speaking Engelish)
a charming, sprightly Zerlina. Revivaldecided hit.
Wednesday.—WERDI's opera, Falstaff. Some
charming music in it; otherwise dull opera. Im-
possible to put Falstaff himself, singing or º:
on any e. Actor or singer invariably over-
weighted. ZELIE DE LUssan, looking like Jessica,
sings Anne Page's music charmingly. SHAKs-
PEARE created “sweet ANNE PAGE” the daughter
of Mrs. Page. Why then, in the opera, is she put
into the Fokd family? I refer to the “Characters” in the book of the
opera, where I find “Mistress Ford,” and “Anne, her daughter.”
GIULIA_RAvogLI a sprightly Dame Quickly; PAULINE JöRAN a
lively Mistress Ford; and Signor DE LUCIA an amiable Fenton,
“with a song.”
Friday. - House not absolutely crowded to hear Carmen. Is
Carmen a bit “off” Yet nothing better than performance of
ZELIE DE Lussan as gay and wicked heroine. Little Don José de
IZucia first-rate, and ANCONA winning encore for old friend Toréador.
MARIE ENGLE excellent goody-goody contrast to bold, bad Carmen.
Police-constable Bevignani, báton in hand, severe when on the beat.
In honour of QUEEN's Birthday, Sir DRURIolanus troupe-ing Il
Saturday.-Faust. “House full.” The Princess and Princesses
present. FIBA's “Jewel, song” a gem, M. PLANÇon, whose
name, Britishly pronounced, suggests". Mr. Pian-soº rather
ºcclesiastical than diabºlical, a highly-coloured but generally effec-

THE DISCOVERY OF LONDON.
Interriewer. As a keen student of your fascinating works, permit
me to render to you my respectful homage.
Distinguished Foreigner in London. Certainly. Iobserve that you
speak the French of the capital with fluency.
Int. You flatter me. I am only an

...F. On the contrary, I have only
recently acquired the English word, “Yes.”
Curiously enough, this is my first voyage
of discovery to your shores. I had, of
Course, often heard of England, and your
literature is not unfamiliar to me. My \
secretary reads to me the works of your
popular poet, Robert BRowNING. -
Int, Do you not, with your–er—limited %
.*. if I may so say, of our lan- %
guage, nd that writer's meaning some-
what obscure? - - --
D. F. Oh no; for my secretary translates him into idiomatic
French verse at sight.
Int, M. Zola has also only recently discovered us. How do your
novelists find the necessary models for their English º: ?
D. F. Nothing simpler. Tradition, voilà tout. The English-
woman, with her large feet, projecting teeth, and execrable French—
we know her because we have . known her. It is not necessary
to have seen her in the flesh. Indeed, it is only a marvel to me that
I find the º so rare in its own country. -
Int. Might I dare to ascribe such traditional views to the prejudice
of ignorance? Your Press, I believe, does not educate itself by
foreign travel.
D. F. I cannot speak for others, but personally, if I do not offend
the laws of courtesy by saying this in the city whose hospitality I
now enjoy, I detest your race. I regard you as insular.
Int. We cannot, of course, help being born on an island. But we
correct this defect by constant visits to the mainland, and from these
we have learnt a profound respect for the tastes of our neighbours.
D. F. I am greatly gratified by this. Nothing has impressed me
so favourably here as your cordial appreciation of our people,
I met a distinguished British novelist who was actually acquainted
with the literature of my own Provence!
Int. May I ask what other features of our comparatively inac-
cessible island have attracted your notice?
D. F. Above all things else, the sinister silence of your city. On
the Stock Exchange, down Cheapside, among vendors of journals,
you can hear a pin drop. Everywhere the taciturnity of the tomb.
Int. And what of our institutions and types?
D. F. Nothing has impressed me so deeply as the Great Wheel at
Earl's Court. It is a monument of national ardour and aspiration.
This, and Mr. STANLEY, and your guardsmen, and your way of
cooking meat, have left the most indelible impression upon my
sentiment and constitution. I dislike the last two of them.
Int. In cooking, we freely yield you the saucepan. But how has
our military given you offence?. .
D. F. I object to the size of its chest, and its manner of occu-
pying the pavement. I have seen a guardsman in Whitehall
against whom, in the heyday of my youth, I should indubitably
have projected my person.
Int. It would have been a rash and perhaps irreparable act. But
tell me more. Kindly hold up once again the veracious mirror, that
we may see ourselves as others see us. We are so apt to be blind to
our own national defects, unless the impartial observer, like yourself,
throws a flood of light upon our idiosyncrasies.
D. F. I should like a few more days in which to complete my
study, and verify my anticipations, of your interesting city. Mean-
while, let me refer you to º GABRIEL MoUREY's new work–Passé
le Détroit. The Ulysses of our century, he has gained a wide know-
ledge of your race, having been afearless traveller in L'Underground,
.# seen some of your most typical fogs. You may learn much from
him. He is º eagerly at home, where, the thirst for books of
ºn; travel and exploration grows hourly. I wish you the good
y. Yes.

Muriel. Is it a boast—or a confession?
Viola (quietly). It is a lie, that’s all. But what did ALAN Roy

Muriel. He says you have a far-away look in your eyes.
Viola (eagerly). Yes? I did my best :

volume.
Alan. There is no mistake so fatal as to
write because one has something to say.

fashionable, Mrs. Averidge. But it's a little trying to you, do you

Mr. Aceridge. It’s perfectly amazing! That boy knows every-

Claude. He’s a staunch Tory!

Mr. Aceridge. Art—
Claude (resigned). He dismisses Symbolism with a word, smiles at
Impressionism as old-fashioned, but speaks most kindly both of
Milºrs and wrisriri. He calls them 'poor dears.” I think that
was the phrase. I won't be sure, but I think so.
Mr. Averidge. Yes, he's astounding. [Ponders.
Qlaude (to MURDEL). Aren't we going to have some music?. How
I. should like you to play those chants to me again! Won't you,

Muriel. Yes; with pleasure. WIola has had my organ put in
the billiard-room, to be out of the way. Rises.

Alan. Oh, I will arrange that. I will hire
a dog-cart in the village; and we must meet
in a lane, or a field, or something. And you
must say you have been to teach the orphan

sweet !
Viola. But—Master Roy—

Viola, Oh
Alan. I was only joking, dear Mrs. ThaveRs.
At three, then.... Sh-sh! (He picks up her
fan with the air of a conspirator.). If I think
of anything else, I’ll write a little note, and

“HECKLING.”—At a meeting of the supporters of Mr. MURRAY,
Master of Elibank, the Liberal candidate for West Edinburgh, the
following “heckle” took place:–
“Mr. Guy. Seeing you approve of Home Rule all round, what is the
smallest number of Parliaments the United Kingdom would require?
(Laughter and a Voice: “Send it back to Parliament Square.")
The Master of Elibank. I think that is a question which can be settled by
an ordinary addition sum. (Cheers and laughter.)”
Which shows that the Master is a real Master of Arts as well as of
Elibank, and, as regards platform difficulties, good at getting out.
But whether he is equally good at “getting in" the future must
decide. A slippery customer, evidently, is Mr. MURRAY, and his title
ought to be “the Master of Eely-bank.’

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FRoM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, May 20.-
JAMES GALLowAY WEIR is a sore man the
night. Ross and Crom hide their dimin-
ished head—or should it heads P-before
the illuminated mountain tops of Inverness-
shire. THE MACGREGoR has done him at
last, done him hopelessly. Since the present
farliament met, The and THE MACGREGoR
have run pretty evenly, neck and neck in race
to show what Scotland can do in this way
when it concentrates its mighty mind on the
effort. In former times Ireland had mono-
ly of the Crank as he was returned to Par-
iament. Scotch Members preserved tradi-
tional reputation of their country as the
home of dour-headed businesslike men. WEIR
standing alone would have sufficed to tear
this fable to tatters. THE MACGREGoR un-
aided would have confounded the tradition.
The combination of talent was irresistible,
overpowering in its force of conviction.
Between these eminent men there has been,
from the first, a feeling of generous rivalry.
THE MAcGREGoR, as befitted , the riper
genius, has been more successful in conceal-
ing it. Whenever he has put a question
about the Crofters, WEIR has managed to
drop in with supplementary inquiry. His
name appearing in the report, watchful
Scotia would take note that THE MACGREGOR
was not the only one of her sons who, in a
foreign land, cared for her interests. THE
MACGREGoR, on the contrary, not less loftil
because without apparent design, ignore
WEIR. There is reason to believe he did not
regard with fullest measure of appreciation
his intellectual capacity, his business apti-
tude, or his parliamentary manner.
“A puir creature!” he said, one night,
staring straight up at the gaslit roof. ere
was no one up there at the moment, and as
this happened to be the night when WEIR
had eleven questions on the paper, by way
of showing his want of confidence in the
Government, and was approaching the ninth
with ever deepening chest notes, there is too
much reason to fear that at that moment the
Member for Inverness-shire was not uncon-
scious of the existence of the Member for

House of Commons, Monday, May 20.-
JAMES GALLowAY WEIR is a sore man the
night. Ross and Cromarty hide their dimin-
ished head—or should it heads P-before
the illuminated mountain tops of Inverness-
shire. THE MACGREGoR has done him at
last, done him hopelessly. Since the present
farliament met, The and THE MACGREGoR
have run pretty evenly, neck and neck in race
to show what'scotland can do in this way
when it concentrates its mighty mind on the
effort. In former times Ireland had mono-
ly of the Crank as he was returned to Par-
iament. Scotch Members preserved tradi-
tional reputation of their country as the
home of dour-headed businesslike men. WEIR
standing alone would have sufficed to tear
this fable to tatters. THE MACGREGoR un-
aided would have confounded the tradition.
The combination of talent was irresistible,
overpowering in its force of conviction.
Between these eminent men there has been,
from the first, a feeling of generous rivalry.
The MAcGREGoR, as befitted , the riper
genius, has been more successful in conceal-
ing it. enever he has put a question
about the Crofters, WEIR has managed to
drop in with supplementary inquiry. His
name appearing in the report, watchful
Scotia would take note that THE MAcGREGoR
was not the only one of her sons who, in a
foreign land, cared for her interests. THE
MAcGREGoR, on the contrary, not less loftil
because without apparent design, .
WEIR. There is reason to believe he did not
regard with fullest measure of appreciation
his intellectual capacity, his business apti-
tude, or his parliamentary manner.
“A puir creature!” he said, one night,
staring straight up at the gaslit roof. There
was no one up there at the moment, and as
this happened to be the night when WEIR
had eleven questions, on the paper, by way
of showing his want of confidence in the
Government, and was approaching the ninth
with ever deepening chest notes, there is too
much reason to fear that at that moment the
Member for Inverness-shire was not uncon-
scious of the existence of the Member for
Ross and Cromarty.

sections... Most depressing and disappointing development of this
tendency appears to-night. The Eldest-Son Party is just bereft of
one of its most active members by WolMER's accession to Earldom.
General GEORGE CURzoN, whose forces, on full muster, counted two,
THE MAcGREGoR RETIREs to HIs CAve.
Mr. W-r “Mon, if I hadna thocht he was jokin', I wad ha’ gone mysel'
—to be even wi' 'im 1"
is now reduced, on Queen's Birthdays and other State occasions, to
reviewing St. John BroDRIck, seul. Force of habit still strong,
and, when speaking to-night, he made House acquainted with the
views on constitutional question which “I and my friends hold.”
It may be singular, but so is the number of the friends. CRAN-
RoRNE, in one of his fiery speeches, made it clear just now that the
Eldest Sons are divided on the question which General GEORGE
CURzoN, Quartermaster-General St. John BRodRICK, and the late
Army (now gone to another place) made their own. This defection
from within not made up by sustentation from without. Joseph,
having got a little mixed between what he said on Coleridge peerage
case, and the exact reverse put forward by him with equal confidence
on the Selborne case. judiciously absented himself to-night. Court
NEY also absent. PRINCE ARTHUR sat ominously silent on Front
Bench, whilst DICK WEBSTER backed up SQUIRE of MALwood in
denouncing position assumed by General George and Quartermaster-
General St. H. As for the Army, multitudinously alluded to as
“the Hon. WILLIAM WALDEGRAVE PALMER, commonly called
Wiscount Wolm ER, now Earl of , SELBoRNE,” it was withdrawn,
interned as garrisons are at particular crises of civic life. House
gladly ordered issue of new writ for West Edinburgh. Constitution
remains unreformed, and WILLIAM WALDEGRAve—to quote with
slight variation from the appropriate source of tombstone literature—
Called hence by early doom,
Lives but to show how sweet an Earl
In House of Lords may bloom.
Business done,—Clause III. added to Welsh Disestablishment Bill.
Thursday —The Bashful BARTLEY, temporarily overcoming a con-
stitutional weakness that is the despair of his friends, and has proved
a serious block in the way of his public advancement, put himself
forward just now. Is disturbed by dalliance of Lord BRAssey, some-
time ago appointed Governor of Victoria. BARTLEY has conviction
that if, in good time coming, his party should acknowledge faithful
service by appointing him to Governorship, he would lose no time in
might be expected to follow. “Instead of which, he goes about the
country—stealing ducks,” BARTLEy, impelled by swing of the quota-
tion, was about to add. Pulling himself up in time, he added:
“making party political speeches in favour of candidates at elections.”
SYDNEY Buxton, in his most Severe-Young-Man-manner, in-
formed the not quite Blameless BARTLEY that BRAssFY not yet set
out to undertake Governorship of Victoria because he is not yet
Governor. HoPEToux's term does not expire till September, and
unless it were desired to run the risk of a sort of colonial Box and
Cor scene, it would be well he should await the due date of his
succession. -
BARTLEY blushed, said nothing—at least, not aloud. To himself
muttered, “They may say what they like; but, after all, bashful-
ness is the best policy.” -
The TIREsoxſe ToMLINson so affected by this repulse of an
esteemed friend and neighbour that when, later in sitting, BARTIEy;
forgetting his pious resolve, moved amendment to Budget Bill
exempting a wife's revenues from income-tax, T.T., rushing out to
support him in division lobby, lost the way; When he arrived at
lobby door, found it locked. Rattled at, handle; kicked panel;
For only reply came whisper through keyhole, in voice he recognised
as ToMMY Bowl.Es': “Too late. Go away, you foolish virgin.”
“Bad enough,” said T.T., “to lose chance of voting against the
Government. But whv ToMMY Bowl.Es should call me a foolish
virgin, I don't know. Do I look like one P” ---
Business done.--Scotch Grand Committee set up. , Opposition
straightway go and gather sticks wherewith to knock it down. -
Friday.--Came across little group in lobby just now steeped in
brackish waters of tribulation. Only three of them, but they
seemed to have all the trouble of the world divided amongst them.
“What’s the matter?” I asked. “Been listening to two hours'
debate on Budget Bill in Committee?”
“Worse than that,” said HART DYKE. “Haven't you heard?
CARMARTHEN, riding out on his bicycle, came by sudden turn on
steam-roller. Bicycle shied; pitched Dolly off.” -
“Poor Dolly!” said JoHN PENN, Emopping his eye with a J pen-
wiper. “He fell on his head.” -

ROBERT ON THE TEMS.
ME and sum of the Gents of the Lundon County Counsel, as they
calls theirselves, has had sum considerable differences of opinion
lately, but I don't suppose as it will cum to much. It seems as sum
on em has got theirselves elected into the Tems Conserwancy Gents,
- and nothink as is dun quite sattis-
fys em unless they has the best
places on bord the crack steamers
as takes em either up the River
or Down the River, as the case
may be. In course they all
wants the werry best heatables
and drinkables, and plenty on
em; but if the water appens to
be §: a little ruff, the one thing
- as they all scrambles for is plenty
* . - - to heat and plenty to drink, and
a nice quiet seat in the Saloon all the way home.
* I herd tell the other day as how as some of the Tems Conserwancy
Gents had a.reglar quarrel with sum of the County Counsel Gents,
| all becoz of the diffrence that sum on em wants to make in the way
in which things is conducted on bord when agoing on their way
home. It most suttenly must make a great diffrence weather it is a
nice, brillyant, sunny day, and all happy on bord, or weather it is a
dull, dark, rainy day, and not room enuff for harf the cumpany.
. I don't find as how as the too º: in the Corporation agrees with
one another more than they used to when they used to quarrel so
much about everythink. In fack they seems jist as much opposed to
each other as ever, and I, for my part, most truly hopes ashow as the
will continue in the same noble spirit, and then they will hate eac
other ºth the same cordial hatred as so distinguished them in days
gone by.
..I don't know a greater treat myself than spending a nour or too
with the County Counsellers at Charing Cross. They can lay the
stingers about in splendid style, and both sides of the question, much
alike in force, and werry much alike in quolity. ... But the werry finist
sight of all I shoud think wood be to see a thorowly good set to
between a picked set of the Tems Conserwancy and another of the
County Counsellers. From what I hears of the former I shoud think
their change would be grand indeed, and from what I have herd of
their, reckless perseverence. I should think their loss almost in-
credible. The Tems is the river for me, and long may it ". sol

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
TERRIBLE things have been happening in Newcastle. If any one
doubts this statement, let him read the #ſº. extract from one of
the local papers. “Though it is a good while,” observes a leader-
writer, “since it could be said with}. that the trade of the country
Was º leaps and bounds, the observation may with abso-
lute accuracy be made with respect to our Newcastle rates. They
have stolen along with woollen feet, and are now about to strike
with iron hands.”
I Bow to the ground in awe-struck admiration before this picture
of rates stealing along on woollen feet and raising iron hands for a
.." at the unfortunate ratepayers of Newcastle. There is
something fell and savage in the mere contemplation of it. Prose is
quite inadequate to it; it demands rhyme, and must have it:—
.. Consider Newcastle, its pitiful case,
* Where the rates have a habit of stealing.
-> 'Tis a way they are prone to in many a place,
- And they do it without any feeling.
.. They move without noise, and they thus get the pull,
Like a cab with a new rubber tyre on;
For their feet, it is said, are a compound of wool,
- Though the hands that they strike with are iron.
". The vision appals me, one glimpse is enough;
- With terror my bosom is heaving.
Yet I venture the hint—do not treat it as stuff—
That steel were more suited for thieving.
SoMETHING always . to be wrong with the streets of Bristol.
I had to notice the melancholy case of Christmas Street last week.
The epidemic has now extended to Old Market Street. Here the
§ is so dangerous that horses fall and break their legs, and
adies die from falls on Easter Mondays. A correspondent who calls
attention to this matter says that “it is quite annoying on a busy
day to have to ask customers two, three, or even four times what
they require.” I º see what this has to do with the pavement,
but J. I have always found it more than annoying to be
asked four times as much as I require, even when my requirements
are small, as they usually are. It is gratifying to find that, in Old
Market Street, at any rate, the shopkeeper who asks has an equal
share of annoyance.
THEN again, Conduit Place, Lower Ashley Road, is not only badly
lighted, but its name is practically unknown. “Even shopkeepersin
the neighbourhood and policemen on the beat do not seem to knºw of
it, and sometimes lead people astray in consequence.” This, how-
ever, is not to be wondered at, as “another difficulty is the number-
ing of the houses; although only about thirty in the road, they are
divided into five terraces with different sets of numbers, which causes
endless confusion.”
INCREASE not, wanderer, the policeman's load;
Ask not the site of Lower Ashley Road.
Inquire not eagerly for Conduit Place,
But start unasking on thy terraced chase.
These places to policemen are unknown,
So shall the pride of finding be thine own.
Go forth, go forth, itinerary pundit,
And find the place that takes its name from Conduit.
Thyº after many a turn and twist’ll
Land thee at Lower Ashley Road in Bristol.
Then pause, and, having raised a thankful voice,
Take 'midst five terraces thy doubtful choice;
And, envied by policemen on their beats,
Return, a lexicon of Bristol streets.
BUT the badness of the streets and the ignorance of policemen
as to their whereabout is nothing to the annoyance caused by the
Salvation Army bands near St. Clement's Church in Newfound-
land Road. “On Ascension Day,” the Vicar writes, “our ser-
vice was completely stopped for several minutes, as the preacher,
who had a bad cold, was unable to shout above the din of the passing
drum.” I shudder to imagine what would have been the plight of the
congregation if the preacher had been free from cold, and capable of
shouting down a drum.
Row1Ng and cricket are more closely connected than many people
suppose. In an account of the Oxford eight-oared bumping races
I read that “New College started at a tremendous bat.” This of
course accounts for the bawling on the bank by which these races
are always accompanied. Further on it is stated that “New College
finished at 40, all out”—which seems rather a small score.
I commRND, the brevity of the Mayor of Cambridge, Mr. HYDE
HILLs, who, being obviously above Hyde Park, does not condescend
to the verbosity of the spouters who on Sundays congregate in that
locality. The other day. Mr. Hype HILLs was, elected to be an
Alderman, and all he said was, “I thank you.” This is optimi
exempli, especially for Aldermen.
LATELY I came across the following touching appeal of an impe-
cunious son to his father:-
Sir, I have piles of bills,
Regular miles of bills;
My banking account's in a hash.
All on the debtor side,
Nought on the better side; [“cash."
The balance you'd hardly call
'Tis terrible when you're re-
-duced thus to penury,
Even if that’s nothing new.
Hope! Can I dream of it?
Yes, there's a gleam of it;
My quarter's allowance is due!
At the Bigg Market in Newcastle was recently held what a local
paper describes as “a demnostration in favour of temperance
reform.” “Demnostration” is a delightful word. It seems to ex-
press in the most compact form enthusiasm and strong language.
A QUESTIon of Police.—A few days since Liverpool set another
lesson to London. No doubt with the consent of the Liverpudlians
(inclusive of “the dangerous classes”), the local police force had a
grand field-day. To quote our excellent º the
Courier, “those who witnessed the police's steady march through
the streets in three battalions, and their effectively-performed
manoeuvres in Sefton Park, would hardly realise what the turn-out
meant to most of the men. They were on duty through the night,
and had very little rest before . had to parade for inspection
(with the march-out and review), and the weather being warm, the
display involved fatigue, so that the refreshments provided, were
very welcome.” Yes, and no doubt well deserved... But why should
London wait? Why should not we have something, of the same
kind?" We might have a grand Police Review in Hyde Park...All
that would be necessary would be to arrange that the metropolitan
thieves should keep the ground!

to get rid of him. I pretend that I do. Later on in the day a small
musical-box arrives, labelled “to be taken twice a day.” Find it
only plays one tune out of Rigoletto. Pitch it out of window.
'uesday.—No better. Consult another doctor, who's just taken his
degree (in music) at Oxford, and is supposed to be very clever. He feels
myſº and looks solemn. Then he asks if I’ve been giving way
to Italian opera lately, and appears coldly sceptical when I explain
that I have been taking it by medical advice. Prescribes essence of

first time of hearing.” Here's another: “Dentists superseded ! All
sufferers from Toothache should attend Herr Boskowsky's course of
Dental Piano Recitals. Worth a guinea a stall.” I also learn that
the Hirsutine Symphony cures baldness, and that the Pink Bavarian

OPERATIC NOTES.
Tuesday.-Madame MELBA as Juliette! Bless her heart, she
must have had a very large one, being a decidedly fine girl for her
age, which I believe was fifteen; while Romeo was about nineteen,
or thereabouts. Mons. ALWAREz, it is needless to
add, looked quite “thereabouts.” Both singing
and acting in first-rate style. Jupiter-Plançon,
converted, appears as Frère Laurent, which,
sounding like “Law—wrong,” is a name rather
descriptive of this worthy Friar's somewhat
underhand proceedings. Friar Law—wrong-
Plain-song excellent. Full house night before
the Derby. , If omens.go for anything, , the
gentleman who making a book in the lobby,
and who overheard some one speak of the opera
as Rosebery and Juliette, might have made a
small fortune. The slip was a tip.
Some people say, “Why orchestra in ‘well’
below stage?” But Sir DRURIoLANUs, with ex-
perience of general advantage to sound and sight,
says, “Shan’t touch 'em. "Leave well alone' is
my motto.” Exit Sir D. merrily.
Saturday.—Strange case of Rigoletto & Co.—“Co.” being MELBA
at her best, BAUERMEISTER and clever JULIA RAvogII, with DE LUCIA
as the Gay Dook, ANCONA as the Fool, suggestive of the PAGLIACGI

coming. To Falstaff and Don Giovani he will give a “high
Maurel tone.”
SPORT, SPECULATION, AND COUNSEL'S OPINION.
So many letters have reached me during the past week begging
for my opinion upon the ºf. of what may be termed sporting
financial speculation, that I scarcely apologise for asking the hospi-
tality of the columns of the leading law paper to give my response.
No doubt the inquiry has to some extent been fostered by the report
that I was seen taking, part in the hippodromatic revels of the
Derby Day. It is true that I certainly visited Epsom on the occa-
sion in question; but only in a semi-official capacity. I have the
honour to be consulting assessor of the Diamond Mine Salting Syndi-
cate, Limited, and in that desirable position havefrequently attended
the meetings of the directors on occasions, so to speak, outside the
Board-room. It is true that my experience as one learned in the law
is seldom required at such seasons, still the directors, as fiduciaries,
are to be applauded for neglecting no opportunity of availing them-
selves of my services.
Having satisfactorily explained how it came that I was on the
Downs when, by a not unnatural coincidence, the Derby was de-
cided, I º to consider the question that has been propounded
to me. Is sporting speculative finance illegal? It is not a matter
that can be decided off-hand. One must be careful not to interfere
with the policy of trade, and do nothing to impede the development
of honest industry. I am asked by a correspondent, who dates “From
Sheffield,” if there is anything undignified in his appearing as a
“bookie” in a pink velvet coat, a yellow slouch hat, with, blue
feathers, and black leather knickerbockers. I can see no objection to
a tradesman wearing any costume he determines to select. It would
perhaps be as well not to attempt to disguise his features, as the
operation might savour of secrecy, the chief element of fraud. This
limitation of course does not apply to an auctioneer, who, having his
name and address displayed on a board hanging on the rostrum he
occupies, can legally carry on his business, if it so pleases him, in a
false mose, a comic wig, and a pair of green spectacles.
But really, a consideration of the costume of the “bookie” merely
reaches the fringe of the subject. The real point at issue is this—Is
betting legal or illegal? It is hard to say. That a bet made on the
racecourse is recoverable is questionable. Suppose that A is prepared
to give odds against The Earl's Choice (the favourite, quoted
officially at 2 to 1) at the rate of five shillings against one
thousand pounds sterling. Presume that B agrees to the wager and
The Earl's Choice wins. B naturally asks for the immediate pay-
ment by A of one thousand*:::: sterling. A declines. Has B any
remedy º: A * I am afraid that the Court (although allowing
costs on the higher scale) would not assist the plaintiff in making
good his claim; However, it would be possible for B to represent to
the other side that the conduct of A was of a character warranting
chronic detention in a lunatic asylum. If this suggestion were
adopted with the necessary discretion, I have no doubt that a com-
promise satisfactory to B would eventually be the outcome of the
negotiations. -
However, although I am a litte uncertain about other bets, I have
no doubt in my own mind that coach sweepstakes under certain cir-
cumstances shºuld be discouraged... I do not wish to rely upon case
I have been given tounderstand) the birthright of every Englishman;
When all Nature is smiling, and man (smoking a *...; cigar)
is at rest, why trouble about mounts and starters and blanks
I have in my mind at this moment the drawing of a certain sweep-
stakes. An eminent counsel (I will not mention his name), was pre-
sent and drew a blank. On his behalf I appeal for a revision, a re-
versal of judgment. Do not let there be a mixture of the glories of
Nature with the ups and down of sporting speculative practice. Let
those who took part in that sweep-winners and losers alike—return
their stakes. I will hold them on the general behalf. Then when I
have received the cash as trustee I will find out that eminent counsel
and place the money in his hands. I have nothing more to add,
save to set forth as a guarantee of good faith my signature warranted
by my address.

OPERATIC NOTES.
Tuesday.-Madame MELBA as Juliette! Bless her heart, she
must have had a very large one, being a decidedly fine girl for her
age, which I believe was fifteen; while Romeo was about nineteen,
or thereabouts. Mons. ALWAREz, it is needless to
add, looked quite “thereabouts.” Both singing
and acting in first-rate style. Jupiter-Plançon,
converted, appears as Frère Laurent, which,
sounding like “Law—wrong,” is a name rather
descriptive of this worthy Friar's somewhat
j proceedings. Friar Law—wrong-
Plain-song excellent. Full house night before
the Derby... If omens.go for anything, , the
gentleman who making a book in the lobby,
and who overheard some one speak of the opera
as Rosebery and Juliette, might have made a
small fortune. The * a tip. -
Some people say, “Why orchestra in ‘well’
below stage?” But Sir DRURIoLANUs, with ex-
perience of general advantage to sound and sight,
says, “Shan’t touch 'em. "Leave well alone' is
my motto.” Exit Sir D. merrily.
Saturday.—Strange case of Rigoletto & Co.—“Co.” being MELBA
at her best, BAUERMEISTER and clever JULIA RAvogII, with DE LUCIA
as the Gay Dook, ANconA as the Fool, suggestive of the PAGLIACGI
mummer with a court appointment. “House full.” MAUREL is
coming. To Falstaff and Don Giovani he will give a “high
Maurel tone.”
SPORT, SPECULATION, AND COUNSEL'S OPINION.
So many letters have reached me during the past week begging
for my opinion upon the ºf. of what may be termed sporting
financial speculation, that I scarcely apologise for asking the hospi-
tality of the columns of the leading law paper to give my response.
No doubt the inquiry has to some extent been fostered by the report
that I was seen taking part in the hippodromatic revels of the
Derby Day. It is true that I certainly visited Epsom on the occa-
sion in question; but only in a semi-official *ś I have the
honour to be consulting assessor of the Diamond Mine Salting Syndi-
cate, Limited, and in that desirable position havefrequently attended
the meetings of the directors on occasions, so to speak, outside the
Board-room. It is true that my experience as one learned in the law
is seldom required at such seasons, still the directors, as fiduciaries,
are to be applauded for neglecting no opportunity of availing them-
selves of my services.
Having satisfactorily explained how it came that I was on the
Downs when, by a not unnatural coincidence, the Derby was de-
cided, I proceed to consider the question that has been propounded
to me. Is sporting speculative finance illegal? It is not a matter
that can be decided off-hand. One must be careful not to interfere
with the policy of trade, and do nothing to impede the development
of honest industry. I am asked by a correspondent, who dates “From
Sheffield,” if there is anything undignified in his Fº as a
“bookie” in a pink velvet coat, a yellow slouch hat, with blue
feathers, and black leather knickerbockers. I can see no objection to
a tradesman wearing any costume he determines to select. It would
perhaps be as well not to attempt to disguise his features, as the
operation might savour of secrecy, the chief element of fraud.
limitation of course does not apply to an auctioneer, who, having his
name and address displayed on a board hanging on the rostrum he
occupies, can legally carry on his business, if it so pleases him, in a
false mose, a comic wig, and a pair of green spectacles.
But really, a consideration of the costume of the “bookie” merely
reaches the fringe of the subject. The real point at issue is this—Is
betting legal or illegal? It is hard to say. That a bet made on the
racecourse is recoverable is questionable. Suppose that A is prepared
to give odds against The Earl's Choice (the favourite, quoted
officially at 2 to 1) at the rate of five shillings against one
thousand pounds sterling. Presume that B agrees to the wager and
The Earl's Choice wins. B naturally asks for the immediate pay-
ment by A of one thousand§: sterling. A declines. Has B any
remedy against A P I am afraid that the Court (although allowing
costs on the higher scale) would not assist the plaintiff in making
good his claim. However, it would be possible for B to represent to
the other side that the conduct of A was of a character warranti
chronic detention in a lunatic asylum. If this suggestion were
adopted with the necessary discretion, I have no doubt that a com-
promise satisfactory to B would eventually be the outcome of the
negotiations.
However, although I am a litte uncertain about other bets, I have
no doubt in my own mind that coach sweepstakes under certain cir-
cumstances should be discouraged. I do not wish to rely upon case
This ſh
I have been given tounderstand) the birthright of every Englishman,
When all Nature is smiling, and man (smoking a *...; cigar)
is at rest, why trouble about mounts and starters and blanks
I have in my mind at this moment the drawing of a certain sweep-
stakes. . An eminent counsel (I will not mention his name), was pre-
sent and drew a blank. On his behalf I appeal for a revision, a re-
versal of judgment. Do not let there be a mixture of the glories of
Nature with the ups and down of sporting speculative practice. Let
those who took part in that sweep-winners and losers alike—return
their stakes. I will hold them on the general behalf. Then when I
have received the cash as trustee I will find out that eminent counsel
and place the money in his hands. I have nothing more to add,
save to set forth as a guarantee of good faith my signature warranted
by my address.

Board-room. It is true that my experience as one learned in the law
is seldom required at such seasons, still the directors, as fiduciaries,
are to be applauded for neglecting no opportunity of availing them-
selves of my services.
Having satisfactorily explained how it came that I was on the
Downs when, by a not unnatural coincidence, the Derby was de-
cided, I proceed to consider the question that has been propounded
to me. Is sporting speculative finance º It is not a matter
that can be decided off-hand. One must be careful not to interfere
with the policy of trade, and do nothing to impede the develºpment
of honest industry. I am asked by a correspondent, who dates “From
Sheffield,” if there is anything undignified in his appearing as a
“bookie” in a pink velvet coat, a yellow slouch hat, with blue
feathers, and black leather knickerbockers. I can see no objection to
a tradesman wearing any costume he determines to select. It would
perhaps be as well not to attempt to disguise his features, as the
operation might savour of secrecy, the chief element of fraud. This
limitation of course does not apply to an auctioneer, who, having his
name and address displayed on a board hanging on the rostrum he
occupies, can legally carry on his business, if it so pleases him, in a
false mose, a comic wig, and a pair of green spectacles.
But really, a consideration of the costume of the “bookie” merel
reaches the fringe of the subject. The real point at issue is this—Is
betting legal or illegal? It is hard to say. That a bet made on the
racecourse is recoverable is questionable. Suppose that A is prepared
to give odds against The Earl's Choice (the favourite, quoted
officially at 2 to 1) at the rate of five shillings against one
thousand pounds sterling. Presume that B agrees to the wager and
The Earl's Choice wins. B naturally asks for the immediate pay-
ment by A of one thousand*:::: sterling. A declines. Has B any
remedy against A P I am afraid that the Court (although allowing
costs on the higher scale) would not assist the plaintiff in making
good his claim. However, it would be possible for B to represent to
the other side that the conduct of A was of a character warranting
chronic detention in a lunatic asylum. If this suggestion were
promise satisfactory to B would eventually be, the outcome of the
negotiations. -
However, although I am a litte uncertain about other bets, I have
no doubt in my own mind that coach sweepstakes under certain cir-
Gumstances should be discouraged... I do not wish to tely upon case
adopted with the necessary discretion, I have no doubt that a com-l'
I have been given tounderstand) the birthright of every Englishman,
When all Nature is smiling, and man (smoking a *...; cigar)
is at rest, why trouble about mounts and starters and blanks
I have in my mind at this moment the drawing of a certain sweep-
stakes. An eminent counsel (I will not mention his name), was pre-
sent and drew a blank. On his behalf I appeal for a revision, a re-
versal of judgment. Do not let there be a mixture of the glories of
Nature with the ups and down of sporting speculative practice. Let
those who took part in that sweep-winners and losers alike—return
their stakes. I will hold them on the general behalf. Then when I
have received the cash as trustee I will find out that eminent counsel
and place the money in his hands. I have nothing more to add,
save to set forth as a guarantee of good faith my signature warranted
by my address.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THE particular Baronitess to whom the Baron handed over The
Holy Estate (a novel in three volumes, by two authors, W. H. WIL-
KINs and FRANK THATCHER, published by HUTCHINson & Co.), says
that in explanation it is called by its authors “a study in morals,”
but where the morals come in or come out
it would be difficult to say. Apparently,
in the majority of the characters, there is a
singular lack of any virtuous quality. A 4
young innocent girl marries a gay soldier ſ.
and goes out to India. Here she finds her— ºf
self placed in a land where principles are de-
cidedly at a discount. Her husband turns
out, to put it mildly, a blackguard (with a !
big, big “B”), : his friends are of the
same fascinating type... In a typical, melo-
dramatic, “Adelphi villain,” there is some-
thing almost wholesome as compared with
the modern bad man of “Yellow-Book”
fiction, who is simply revolting. ſº the
way, interpolates the Baron, the latest
Yellow Book is comparatively quite deco-
rous and without an Aubrey-Beardsley
illustration!!] Of course, the hero and
heroine of The Holy Estate have to pass
through the fiery ordeal of Indian Society;
how they come out of it the reader may
discover. But as pessimism is the artistic -
order of the day, they are not allowed to finish well and “live º
ever afterwards.” My Baronitess adds, with a frown, “It cannot be
called pleasant reading, nor is there in it any sign of the genius of
a DAUDET or a Zola which might be accepted as, in some sort, a
literary excuse for its being brought into existence.”

“WATERS, WATERS EVERYWHERE!”
ONE of the reasons for the popularity of
Apollinaris. Water, mentioned the other day
at a “meeting of the waters” was, that men
generally scon became on such intimate terms
with this water-nymph as to be able to speak
of her familiarly as "Polly.” “Whisky an
Polly” seemed to go so well together as to be
suggestive of a round dance, in which the
admirer of “Polly” was whisky ing her
round the ball-room. The gradual rise of
Johannis in public opinion, delayed, of course,
in the first place, by politeness on the part
of “Johnnie,” who must cede the pas to
“Polly,” is due to the fact that the aérated-
water drinkers had not made up their minds
as to whether Johannis was to be addressed
as "Jo", or “Johnnie.” We believe that
...Johnnie” is now the accepted appellation.
Whether “Johnnie” and “Polly” are on the
best terms, this deponent knoweth not; nor
is he aware that during the season The
Bishop of Bath and Wells or The Bishop of
Sodor-water-and-Man will bless the union of

This and all else would be excelled when JoHN WILLIAM began to
jest, and LENG made light reply.
This was natural expectation from reputation of these famous wits.
In dreary conversation that followed there was one solitary flicker
of humour; it was dis-
covered by anxious

whole business was

raked him fore and aft. KENyon, who knows
more than you think when you hear him speak,
tells me it is pretty certain when the next
Government is formed, SILoMo will have his
choice of succeeding either Edward GREY or
SYDNEY Buxton. Neither office is of Cabinet
rank. But with the chief in the Lords, a states-
man of SILoMIo's ability and sagacity can make
and keep a position equal in importance and
influence to some more highly placed. No one
will deny that the promotion will have been
well earned. The Sheffield Knight has, perhaps,
been more prominently associated with the con-
duct of Colonial affairs than with those nominally
directed by Lord KIMBERLEY with the assistance
of Edward GREY. This is a view strengthened
by the circumstance of the honourable title con-
ferred upon him by the emissaries from Swaziland.
Actually, SILoMIoknows quite as much of Foreign
Affairs as he does of Colonial.

his attention on the action of the Foreign Office.

emigrants in the Mayflower proudly carried

through every gutter of foreign capitals.

when this country was so isolated among the
nations of Europe.”

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
THERE is, of course, to be an Eisteddfod in 1896; and it appears
that the Llandudno Executive Committee have been making some
revolutionary proposals with reference to it., They have resolved
that they “respectfully desire that the Gorsedd see its way to
concur in the subject for the chair
being in any metre, and not re-
stricted to an awdl. The Committee
are aware that the awdl has anti-
* } quity and custom in its favour, but,
while calculated to develop skill in
| metrical composition, the local Com-
mittee feel that the necessity of
composing in the form of an awdl
is fettering to the conception and
imagination.” I cannot say what
an awdl is, but I am dead against
fetters, and, therefore, I say, down
with the dastardly, fettering awdl.
Swift, strike off the fetters, wher-
ever they’re found,
Let the song-loving Welshman go
free and unbound.
To the awdl too long has he bended
s knee, -
But its fate has been sealed, and the Welshman is free;
As free as his ocean, as free as his breezes,
He shall write as he likes, in what metre he pleases;
And he faces his Gorsedd, and vows he won't dawdle
A manacled slave in the train of the awdl.
AFTER this it seems somewhat bald and prosaic to read that
On the recommendation of “Hwfa Mon” (the Archdruid), “Eifionydd’”
(the registrar), “Cadvan,” “Pedrog,” “Gwynedd,” and “Dyfed,” of the
Gorsedd Committee, who stated that the subject chosen for the arwrgerdd
(heroic poem), for which a prize of £20 and a silver crown is offered, was un-
suitable for an arwrgerdd, the subject was changed, “Llewelyn Fawr.” being
substituted for “St.Tudno.”—Instead of the galar-gan, the subject of which
was “Clwydfardd,” for which £15 was the prize, it was decided to offer a
prize of £15 and a gold medal for the best awdl on “Clwydfardd,” the
Gorsedd stating that an awdl would be much more appropriate, as the late
Archdruid was a great admirer of the twenty-four metres. Instead of the hir
a thoddaid “Cestyll Cymru.” (Castles of Wales) it was decided to offer a
rize of £2 2s. for the best hir a thoddaid “Beddargraph “Elis Wyn o
yrfai,” and also £2 2s. for the best hirathoddaid “Beddargraph “Tudno.’”
THE Bishop of HEREFORp has requested the parishes in his diocese
to send up petitions respecting the Armenian atrocities. 9ne of these
parishes is Walford-on-Wye, and I propose to confer immortality
upon the reply sent by its Wicar to the Bishop.
“I regret” (says this truly Christain cleric) “having been unable to re-
spond in the way you desired to your appeal respecting the persecution of
Christians in Armenia. My not doing so was owing to the circumstance
that at the present time a remonstrance from our nation can have no moral
weight whatever. We have now in office a Government which is exercising
all its ingenuity in plans for the persecution and plunder of Christians here,
and so long as we tolerate the continuance of such a Government in office the
Turk would be justified in telling us to reform this scandal before we presume
to remonstrate with him.”
IN other words, the Vicar of Walford-on-Wye º: of the
Welsh Church Disestablishment Bill, and refuses on that account to
join in a protest against the torture and murder of his Armenian
fellow-creatures. The logic of the Vicar is as convincing as his
Christian sympathy is admirable. Let him be known henceforth as
the Vicar of Reason Wye.
WHAT on earth is a “Rational Sick and Burial Association ?”
They possess one at Acton Turville; and, only the other day, it held
f. junketings. I may possibly have been rationally sick, but I
ave certainly never yet been rationally, or even irrationally, buried,
nor, I take it, have the very vigorous members of the Association.
However, they had a procession, which started from the club-room,
headed by the Malmesbury band, and then walked to Badminton,
calling at the Duke of BEAUFoRT's, where they were all treated with
refreshments. Imagine his sporting Grace's feelings at being called
upon to treat with refreshments a procession of the rationally sick
and buried. They then dined. . The menu is not given, but no doubt
included bread made from mummy-wheat, Dead-sea fruit, and
copious libations of bier (spelling again!).
CLose to Bristol, too, there is a #. rejoicing, in the name of
Fishponds, where, at the Full Moon Hotel, the Loyal Pride of Fish-
ponds Lodge of the Bristol Equalised District of the Order of Druids
meets for its various celebrations. The members sometimes “peram-
bulate the village, headed by the band of the Mangotsfield detach-
ment of the Bristol Rifles.”
Now strike the clashing cymbals, and sound the big bassoon,
The Loyal Pride of Fishponds Lodge has left the old “Full Moon,”
Yet, though their band be warlike, they mean nor war nor pillage,
'Tis charity that bids them thus perambulate the village.
No member of the Order would dare to come too late
When Fishponds calls her Druids out to celebrate a fête.
Then, while with martial music, the left foot on the beat,
The Lodge awakes the echoes loud in every yillage street,
The villagers of Fishponds forsake their early bed,
And each one at his window displays a nightcapped head,
Salutes the hoary Druids, nor fails to greet with cheers,
The Mangotsfield detachment of Bristol Wolunteers.
A CoRRESPONDENT writes to the Scotsman, protesting against the
omission of the grey plover from, the list º birds to be protected
under the Wild Birds Protection Act. “That the eggs,” he adds,
“are gathered by keepers and others for sale, should certainly be no
argument; and any keeper might well be ashamed to watch a r
harmless bird all day through binoculars for the p se of making
a few shillings by the sale of its eggs.”. We live and learn. . I have
been eating plover's eggs for years without the least suspicion that
the poor harmless mother-bird had been shamefully watched through
binoculars by a keeper in search of shillings. All the same. I
heartily indorse the suggestion that the plover should be protected.
SIR DONALD CURRIE must have the eye of an eagle. Speaking at
a luncheon held in Newcastle the other day in connection with the
Trinity Presbyterian Church, he declared that “nothing had ever
charmed him more than to observe at the luncheon that day the
marvellous ability, but much more the marvellous unanimity and
Christian fellowship manifested 5. the Nonconformist bodies.” I
doff º cap to the man who can infer not only marvellous unanimity
and Christian fellowship, but also marvellous ability from his ob-
servation of bodies at luncheon. After this it must be the merest
child's-play to navigate the Tantallon Castle to the Baltic Canal.
At a recent meeting of the Blackrock Town Commissioners, so I
gather from the Freeman's Journal, Dr. Kough, the Vice-Chairman,
objected to the adoption of a petition in favour of the Intoxicating
Liquors (Ireland) Bill. He said the petition had been carried by a
side-wind. Obviously, in the Doctor's opinion, the only thing to be
done was to Kough-drop it.
THE ASCENT OF MAN.

of the Free Church and very severely handled.”—Daily Telegraph.]

LIGHT AND HEAT; or, IN A CoNCATENATION Accordingly.—
#.; of “the invisible parts of the solar spectrum,” Dr.
Uggins tells us the “ultra-red" has been traced to a distance nearly
“ten times as long as the whole range of the visible or light-giving
region of the spectrum.” Nature, indeed, is “all of a piece.” In
politics, as in optics, the “Ultra-Red” lies beyond the “light-
giving region,” though, as Science says of its “gamut of invisible
rays,” they are perceived “by their heating effects.” The S. D. F.'s
and other wavers of the Red Flag, should study up-to-date optics.
“SIC ITUR AD Astra.”—The Balloon, Society has presented
“W. G.” with its gold medal. Therefore has he pardonable cause
for inflation. It is to be hoped that this will not have the effect of
making him hit “skyers.” In spite of # aéronaut medal, may we
never see “e'er a naught” tacked on to W. G.'s name.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
: AT A YEOMANRY REVIEW.
SCENE–An open space near Baymouth, the watering-place at which
the County Yeomanry have been going through their annual
training. Along one side of the ground is a row of drags and
other carriages, occupied by the local magnates; along another,
the less distinguished spectators stand in a thin line or occasional
groups, waiting for the review to begin. In the centre, the in-
speciing officer is judging the best turned-out troop, while the
remainder of the regiment are doing nothing in particular.
Yeomanry Non-Com. (who is leading an officer's horse and talk-
a military acquaintance.) Oh, Captain CLINKER, do come and tell
me what they’re supposed to be doing out there, and whether
they've begun yet.
Capt. Clinker (R.A.). Nothin' much goin' on at present. Ah,
they seem to be wakin' up now a bit. (As the band strikes up.)
There's the general salute; now they're goin' to make a start.
Mrs. Pratt. Who is that little man in the baggy black frock,
rather, like a dressing-gown, and the cocked hat; and why is he
galloping out here? .
º C. He's the inspectin' officer; takin' up his position for the
march past, don't you know.
Mrs.Pratt. Oh; and they're all going to march past him. How

The Y. L. (with coquettish in-

if the truth was told, you know
more than one young lady who’s
glad enough to be seen about with
you.

Mrs. Pratt. No, they're dressed
very like Hussars—or isit Artillery
I mean? I always had an idea the
Yeomanry wore comic uniforms-
with shirt-collars, you know, and
old-fashioned milk-pail hats with
feathers and things. But (dis-
appointedly) there’s nothing ridi-
culous about these. What a frisky
animal that trumpeter is riding;
look at him caracoling about!
Capt. C. Trumpeters and serjeant-
majors always the best mounted.
Mrs. Pratt, Are they? I wonder
why that is. (As the regiment
ranks by in single file.) But they’ve
all got beautiful horses.
Capt. C. (critically). H'm;
they're a fair-lookin' lot. Fall off
a bit behind, some of 'em.
Mrs. Pratt. Do they P. Then they
can't be very good riders, can they?
Capt. C. These fellows? They
ought to be; most of 'em, you see,
hunt their horses regularly.
Mrs. Pratt. (with a mental vision
of dismounted troopers chasingtheir
chargers about the ground). What
fun ſ I should like to see them
do that. (As the regiment trots
past in sections.) But they don't
seem to come off over the trotting.
Capt. C. Not quite; the leaders don't keep their distance, so the
men can't keep up. Still, considering how short a time they’ve been
out, you can't expect—
Mrs. Pratt. No; and they haven't tried to gallop yet, have they?
Some of the horses are cantering now, though; it looks so much
nicer than if they all trotted, I think. -
Capt. C. Don't fancy their Colonel would agree with you there.
Mrs. Pratt. What a shame to keep those poor soldiers out there
all by themselves; they don't have any fun, and they only get in
the way of the others when they turn round. Oh, look at them
now—they’re all coming straight at us, and waving their swords!

leaders or party as a party. There was no subsidy by the party, no
assistance, given by party speakers, and he had to rely upon the
electors alone. These elementary political principles endorsed by
unanimous vote of continued confidence in esteemed member. Wote

OPERATIC NOTES.
Saturday.— Production of Harold." New
ra; music by Cowen, book by Sir E.
|ALET, British Representative man in ser-
vice of Foreign Office, writing words for
diplomatic, and words for musical notes.
However good-tempered a composer may be,
yet when he wants to write an opera he
cannot get on without “having words.”
No time left to give full criticism on Harold,
which achieved sufficient success to satisfy
composer and librettist; it may be as well to
state that there is nothing “old” in it, ex-
cept in last syllable of name. Years ago
favourite subject with artists was “the find-
ing of the body of HARold.” Sir Edward
has found body; Cowen clothed it. ALBANI
is its life and soul. Composer conducted.

no more at present.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
My Baronite, constitutionally credulous, on readin
the earlier
works of John OLIVER Hobbes, accepted the masculinity. of the
author as put forward on the title e. On reading The Gods,
Some Mortals, and Lord Wickenham (HENRY & Co.), he begins to
doubt. No man, not the weakest-minded amongst us, habitually
uses italics in writing a book. Moreover, none but a woman could
draw such a creature, as Mrs. Anne Warre. The more generous
masculine nature could not imagine anything so unrelievedly unde-
sirable, Doubtless she is made so bad the more strikingly to compare
with Allegra, “whose charm was the charm of springtime and love,
all the kind promises of the sunshine, the life, the tenderness, the
warmth, the graciousness of nature.” The book, the most ambitious,
and, in point of length, the most important, that has come from the
pen of JoBN OLIVER Hobbes, is marked by her gift of keen observa-
tion, that sees everything and sees through most people. Dialogue
and narrative sparkle with felicitous turns, bubble over with epigram.
There are º: possibilities in John OLIVER HobBEs ; § she
should turn her face more persistently to the sunlight. Dr. Warre
and Allegra are so good and so pleasant, that the average reader
would like a little more of them, and a little less of the almost im-
possible Mrs. Warre.
The proper study of mankind is man, and there could not be an
apter tutor than Mr. SMALLEY. His Studies of Men (MACMILLAN),
have, as he tells us in a preface, appeared for the most part in the
New York Tribune. #. conversant with newspaper work
will know that for many years Mr. SMALLEY's Letter from London to
what, take it all in all, is the principal, certainly the weightiest,
journal in the United States, has been its most prominent feature.
A selection of these contributions have, happily, been rescued from
the files of the newspaper, and are here presented. The Studies cover
a wide range, but the subjects are all, in diverse fashion, interesting.
One is struck with the extreme fairness of judgment displayed in
dealing with men who stand sofar apart as, for example, Mr. Abºth UR
BALFour, Mr. PARNELL, Mr. SPURGEoN, TENNYson, Lord RoseBERY,
Sir WILLIAM HARcourt, Mr. Froupe, Mr. John WALTER, and
Lord RANDolph CHURCHILI. During his long residence in England
Mr. SMALLEY has known these and others, personally and in their
public aspect. He has stored a picture gallery in which posterity
may see them as they lived, nothing extenuated nor anything
set down in malice. By way of redressing afresh the balance
between the Old World and the New, Mr. SMALLEY has turned his
back on London, and, having all these years written about
Europeans, for the edification of Transatlantic readers, is about to
tell Europe, in the columns of the Times, something of the under-
current of public affairs in the United States. e will find in
himself a most damaging rival. ' THE BARON DE B.-W.

OPERATIC NOTES.
Saturday.-Production of Harold." New
ra; music by Cowen, book by Sir E.
[ALET, British Representative man in ser-
vice of Foreign Office, writing words for
diplomatic, and words for musical notes.
However good-tempered a composer may be,
yet when he wants to write "an opera he
cannot get on without “having words.”
No time left to give full criticism on Harold,
which achieved, sufficient, success to satisfy
composer and librettist; it may be as well to
state that there is nothing “old” in it, ex-
cept in last syllable of name. Years ago
favourite subject with artists was “the find-
ing of the body of HARold.” Sir Edward
has found body; Cowen clothed it. ALBANI
is its life and soul. Composer conducted.
May probably be heard again this season; so
no more at present.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
My Baronite, constitutionally credulous, on readin
works of John OLIVER
author as put forward on the title e. On reading The Gods,
Some Mortals, and Lord Wickenham (HENRY & Co.), he begins to
doubt. No man, not the weakest-minded amongst us, habitually
uses italics in writing a book. Moreover, none but a woman could
raw such a creature as Mrs. Anne Warre. The more generous
masculine nature could not imagine anything so unrelievedly unde-
sirable. Doubtless she is made so bad the more strikingly to compare
with Allegra, “whose charm was the charm of springtime and love,
all the kind promises of the sunshine, the life, the tenderness, the
warmth, the graciousness of nature.” The book, the most ambitious,
and, in point of length, the most important, that has come from the
pen of John OLIVER Hobbes, is marked by her gift of keen observa-
tion, that sees everything and sees through most people. Dialogue
and narrative . with felicitous turns, bubble over with epigram.
There are boundless possibilities in John Olive R Hobbes; § she
should turn her face more persistently to the sunlight. Dr. Warre
and Allegra are so good and so pleasant, that the average reader
would like a little more of them, and a little less of the almost im-
possible Mrs. Warre.
The proper study of mankind is man, and there could not be an
apter tutor than Mr. SMALLEY. His Studies of Men (MACMILLAN),
the earlier
Hobbes, accepted the masculinity of the
– |have, as he tells usin a preface, appeared for the most part in the
New York, Tribune. Everyone conversant with newspaper work
will know that for º years Mr. SMALLEY's Letter from London to
what, take it all in all, is the principal, certainly the weightiest,
journal in the United States, has been its most prominent feature.
A selection of these contributions have, happily, been rescued from
the files of the newspaper, and are here presented. The Studies cover
a wide range, but the subjects are all, in diverse fashion, interesting.
One is struck with the extreme fairness of judgment displayed in
dealing with men who stand sofar apart as, for example, Mr. ARTHUR
BALFour, Mr. PARNELL, Mr. SPURGEoN, TENNYson, Lord RoseBERY,
Sir WILLIAM HARcourt, Mr. FROUDR, Mr. John WALTER, and
Lord RANDolph CHURCHILL. During his long residence in England
Mr. SMALLEY has known these and others, sonally and in their
public aspect. He has stored a picture gallery in which posterity
may see them as they lived, nothing extenuated nor anything
set down in malice. By way of redressing afresh the balance
between the Old World and the New, Mr. SMALLEY has turned his
back on London, and, having all these years written about
Europeans, for the edification of Transatlantic readers, is about to
tell Europe, in the columns of the Times, something of the under-
current of public affairs in the United States. e will find in

THERE seems to be a º among lady
writers that they also should have been
remembered in the . distri-
bution. That is all very well, but quite a new
demand has been started by the Cork Con-
stitution, which remarks,—
“It would not of course be regular to bestow a
knighthood upon a lady; but the rule in the
case of Mrs. DISRAELI might be observed, and
a Baroness be conferred upon the author of Lady
Audley's Secret.”
What would Miss BRADDoN do with a Ba-
roness when she got her? Work her up into
her next plot? Peeresses must be “cheap
to-day,” if they can be given away in this
generous style.

A KIND INQUIRY.
DEARMR, PUNCH,-A touch-
ing epitaph has lately come
under my notice. It runs as
follows:–
“HIC JACET ANONYMA.
She dwelt among the untrodden
ways.
Where yellow asters throve,
A maid whom there were few to
praise >:Tº
And fewer still to love. 's ºf
She lived unknown, so none can
know
The hour she ceased to be,
Enough to know she has, and oh!
Pray, all men, R.I.P.”
Is it Fºl. that our old
friend, the New Woman, that
quite “impossible she,” has
left us for “another place” P
It seems almost too good to
be true.
Yours unfeelingly,
A. MISONEogyNIST.
P.S.—You will observe that
she died a spinster, of uncer-
tain age.
A SPORTSMAN, not particu-
larly literary, but very fond of
theatricals, says that he hears
there is a play going on called
Don Quickshot. He thinks the
first syllable may have been
accidentally omitted, but feels
certain that the London Quick-
shot ought to make a hit.

Telegraph reported “The
Heroism of a Lady.” The act
and deed was that of Miss
Evans, of Hythe, near South-

man and a woman from drown-

and resoned a girl, who was
sinking for the third and last
time. The girl saved will ever
gratefully remember Miss
Evans as the lady who
“brought her up by hand,”

AIR-‘‘The Day is Done.”
THE day is done, and the darkness
Falls from the brow of night,
Like a crape-mask drifting downward
From a burglar in his flight.
I see the lights of “the village”
Gleam through the evening mist,
And a feeling of dryness comes o'er me,
And a tiddley I can't resist.
A feeling of blueness, and longing
For a spree, and another drain;
It resembles sorrow only
As gooseberry does champagne.
Come, tip me some snappy poem,
Some iky and rorty lay,
That shall banish this chippy feeling,
And drive dull care away.
Not from the slow old stodges,
Nºt from the smugs sublime,
Who hadn't a notion ºf patter,
And were slaves to tune and time:
For, like chunks of WAGNER's music,
They worrying thoughts suggest,
Dull duty, and º endeavour,
And to-night I long for rest.
Tip a stave from some Lion Comique,
ose songs are snide and smart,
And who makes you roar, like Roberts,
Who, without thought or labour,
And “on his own,” with ease,
Can whack out the ripping chorus
Of music-hall melodies.
Such songs have power to quicken
The pulse that beats low with care;
And come like the “Benedictine”
That follows the bill-of-fare.
So pick from the cad, or the coster,
Some º. for choice; .
And lend to the rhymes of the Comique
The tones of a stentor voice.
And our feet shall thumptune to the music,
And the bills that I cannot pay
Shall be folded up, like my brolly,
And as carefully put away.
THE GOOSE AND THE EAGLE,
(A Fable.)
A Goose that had miss-spent a long life,
and, in addition to being old and ugly, was of
a sour, ill-natured disposition, in despair of
rendering herself any longer agreeable to her
male acquaintances, conceived the desperate
design of emancipating her female friends.
“It is intolerable,” she declared to a large
assemblage of the latter who flocked together
directly the news of her design was noised
abroad, “it is intolerable that, whilst all the
good things of this life are reserved for the
exclusive use and enjoyment of our male
tyrants, we poor female creatures should be
put off with feeble bodies and dowdy, un-
attractive plumage. I will go immediately
to the King of Birds and demand the instant
redress of these grievances under pain of my
Scarcely had the Goose received the thanks
of her audience for this valiant speech, when
an Eagle, which chanced to be soaring at that
moment in the heavens above them. and was
attracted by the clamour that reached him,
dropped suddenly to the earth in order to dis-
cover the cause of it; to whom the Goose, so
soon as she was sufficiently recovered of her
fears, humbly addressed her complaint.
“Foolish bird l’ exclaimed the Eagle,
when the Goose had made an end of her com-
§ “know you not that what is fixed
y Nature cannot possibly be altered by birds;
and that if your sex have weaker bodies and
a less attractive plumage than belong to us of
the male gender, it is because Nature wills it
so, and must be obeyed? Learn to be content
with what you have, and cease envying those
to whom Nature has been more prodigal of
certain favours than she has been to you.
Remember, also, foolish bird! that strength
of mind is not the same thing with strength
of body, and that though you may possess the

(A Dramatic Fragment from Drury Lane.)
Scene—The Auditorium of the National Theatre. Present the
customary throng. A performance on the stage is occupying the
spectators' wrapt attention. Newly-married couple in stalls
lding a discussion in undertones.
Angelina. I am so glad, dear, you did not get a book of the words.
It will be such a capital exercise for my Italian. I find that I can
understand every word.
Edwin (happy to have saved the expense ºf purchasing a trans-
lated libretto). Quite so, dear... You can tell me what they are doing.
Ang. Certainly, dear. Look, they are now having supper. You
see, the heroine called for candles, and the waiter put them on the
table. And now they are talking about things in general. And
that is Armande. And don't you see Marguerite is ill.
Edwin. Yes; she is fainting in front of a window.
... Ang, Exactly, , Italian is so easy–almost like English. She gives
# a flower, and he goes away. He says adieu, and then the curtain

Edwin. Was that in Italian too?
Ang. Don't be absurd. (They discuss things in general, until the
curtain rises on the Second Act.) Look, it is the same scene. You
see, they are engaged. , She is making love to him.
Edwin. Is that why he is sitting in a chair with his back to the
audience while Marguerite strokes i. hair?
Ang. Yes. While she is stroking his hair she is saying how fond
she is of him. And now he is telling her how fond he is of her.
Edwin (after a quarter of an hour). What are they saying 2
Ang. Oh, just the same thing over and over again. The Italian
language is so beautiful. “Oh, Armande!” She calls him by his
Christian name. She is so attached to him.
Edwin. But what was the meaning of that?
†: (at the end of the Act). Oh, don't you see, he said something
that pleased her. Then she kissed him. #. , I had no idea how
easy Italian was, Of course, one understands it from knowing
French. (Entr'acte passes as before, and curtain rises on Act Three.)
Ah, here we are at Auteuil. Yes, and here comes Marguerite with
Edwin. Isn't this piece rather like the Trariata ?
Ang. I don't know. But I never saw the Opera. And there,
that old gentleman has come to call upon Marguerite. -
Edwin. Why, of course, like the old chap with the baritone song.
Now I begin to inderstand Italian myself.
Ang. Do you, dear? Well, you see, he was going to be rude, and
then they made it up, and she gave him a chair. And there, do you
see? she leaves a letter for Armande. It is for him to read. And
now she leaves him. And he is reading the letter.
Edwin. And doesn't seem to like it. And there's the old chap
(without the song), and he is consoling him.
Ang. (after a glance at her playbill). Yes, because they are father
and son. (The Fourth Act passes, and she explains to husband
that Marguerite has been playing at cards, and that Armande is
very angry with her.) That’s why he throws money at her.
Edwin. Rather a cad—Armande. -
Ang. Oh, no. You know we must not judge foreigners by an
English standard. (The last Act commences.) You see, she is
very ill. That cradle covered with rugs is her bed.
Edwin. Indeed!
Ang. Yes. And that I suppose must be the doctor...I wonder
what they are saying ! This Act they all seem to be talking faster
than they did in the others. That old woman was her friend. I
wonder whv she has left her like that! -
Edwin. Didn't she say something like “What a rum go?” It is
the only line I have understood since the commencement of the
performance, What is she saying now? -
Ang; (hesitating). Well, I am not quite sure. But you see she is
very ill. She scarcely recognises Armande.
Edwin. What is he saying P. What has he done with his father?
Ang. (perplered). I can't quite follow this Act—they talk so fast.
Edwin. And, I say, why on earth have these two turned up?'. A
lady in complete bridal costume-wreath, veil, and all—and a chap

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
IT has been noticed by philosophers that a mere name will often
lead a man to his ruin. Why, for example, was JoHN DARLEY fined
twenty shillings and costs at the Tynemouth Petty Sessions? He
met a boiler-smith, RICHARD RothweLL, riding on a bicycle.
Thereupon, without any apparent
reason, he used abusive language,
bashed the unoffending boiler-
smith on the nose, brandished a
knife, and shouted out, “Come
on!—I’m John NY DARLEY, from
Byker.” There you have it. Re-
siding, as he did, in a perpetual
comparative, he naturally despised
and loathed the positive “byke.”
* his violent assault on its

I observe, with deep regret, that
Professor LLOYD, of Southport, has been fined for trespassing on a
railway bridge at Preston. The Professor did not want to stay there.
All he wished to do, and all that he actually did, was to dive off into
the water below. He is an aquatic Professor, and informed the
Hººh that he was obliged to do these things to keep up his reputa-
1011.
I'LL tell you a tale of Professor LLoyd,
o dived off a bridge at Preston—
An act that the magistrates much annoyed,
Though he kept both his coat and vest on.
They said “You mustn't repeat this joke,
Professor, or else you’ll rue it.”
But LLOYD, the Professor, he up and spoke,
And said, “I’m obliged to do it.
U. on the bridge I stand for awhile,
stand till I fairly shiver
Then down I go—it seems like a mile—
And I plunge in the bubbling river.
I hope Fº worships won't “queer my pitch,”
For I’m sorry to give you trouble
In maintaining a reputation, which
Is so closely combined with bubble.”
I wish I had been in Hawick lately. Ever since I first learnt the
rudiments of the English language I have been haunted by a desire
to know how a man looked and acted when he “bussed the
Standard.”. They’ve done that, at Hawick “in connection,” as I
read, “with the celebration of the ancient custom of the Common
Riding.” Iater on “the local slogan ‘Teribus' was sung with great
vigour.” There is something crushing, scattering, and battle-herald-
ing about the mere sound of that fearful word.
J. B., who describes himself as “A Residenter in Oswald Road,”
writes to The Scotsman to complain of the flimsy material used in the
construction of the lamp-posts near his dwelling. The other day a
milk-van ran away—at least, the horse drawing it did. “One would
think,” says J. B., “the progress of such a small vehicle would have
been arrested by coming into collision with one lamp-post, but four
posts were destroyed by the van. On examination it is found that
the foundation of a street lamp-post only goes three inches into the
stone below it. With such a short hold the lamp-post is easily
toppled over.” Of course it is. To
quately gives a direct encouragement to milk-vans to run away and
** their destruction. Let the Lord Provost of Edinburgh look
1U.
THE, Master and the Matron of the workhouse at Stratford-on-
Avon have, resigned, and the guardians have been “considerably
discussing ” the appointment of their successors. Eventually it was
resolved, not only to reduce the salaries, but also-hear this, ye
licensed. victuallers!—to cut off the beer-money hitherto paid.
What dignity can possibly attach to a workhouse officer who has to
pay for his own beer?... It is by such insidious attacks as this that
the foundations of public confidence are shaken, and the wholefabric
of the Constitution is endangered. My mind misgives me when I
attempt to forecast the future of Stratford.
AT Tetbury there is a lodge of the recently-established Conser-
vative Working Men's Benefit Society. It is called—absit omen—
the Trouble House Lodge, and quite recently it held a fête and
dinner. 'Tis yº. fête-day somewhere in the world. Indeed, the
amount of fêtes that *º. on any given day, in provincial
fix lamp-posts so inade-li
IN the world that we live in our troubles are great
To add to their number is scarcely the game.
Nav, how can these lodgers delight in their fete,
With perpetual trouble attached to their name?
At Qwens College, Manchester, so I gather from the letter of
“An Old Student” in The Manchester Guardian, some of the
students are beginning to feel, that “while its teaching of specific
subjects is admirable, in fact, unsurpassed, its general education—
that education which consists, in the development of men—has not
yet reached the same level.” They therefore wish to develop
athletics, and by making the modest subscription of 10s. 6d. com-
pulsory on all, “to decoy the unathletic man into taking exercise
almost without knowing it.” At present only 150 out of 800 students
pay up. I heartily commend this proposal, though I confess I should
like to know what sort of exercise it is that a man can take almost
without knowing it. Let the unathletic man be decoyed by all
means, but let him thoroughly understand that he is to take exercise,
and take it, if possible, with reasonable violence.

ChER MonstruR,-Last year I am gone to your races of Ascot. It
is beautiful, it is ravishing, but how it is dear! Thousand
thunders, how it is dear! I go to the Grand Prix, I pay twenty
francs, that is also dear, but it is all, it is finished. Eh well, I desire
to see one time your Gold Cup, and I go of good hour by railway.
Arrived there I º one pound, that what you call one sov., and I
enter. I suppose I can go by all—partout, how say you? Ah, but
no! I see by all some affiches “One Pound.”
I can to write your language enough well, but I speak with
much of difficulty. Therefore I read the affixes without nothing
to ask. Thus when I read “One Pound” I go no more far. I walk
myself in the charming garden and I see the beautiful misses. Ah
how they are adorable! DAUDET has wrong, DAUDET is imbecile,
they are adorable. It is not the pain to § again some pounds for to
see to run the horses, when I can to see the misses who walk them-
selves here, without to pay of more.
But in fine I am fatigued. Also I have great hunger, for it is the
hour of the déjeuner. But without doubt one is obliged to pay one
pound before to enter the bar. My word, I will not I shall not pay
one sov., and more, for a squashed lemon and a bun of Bath. I go to
smoke at place of that, and I walk myself at the shade all near of an
arch.
All of a blow all the world lifts himself and comes very quick
towards me. I cannot escape, I am carried away by the crowd, I
arrive to the arch. I think “Du courage, Auguste mon cher / Sois
calme / S'il y a encore une livre d payer—” But there is no
sov., and I pass. Thousand thunders! What is, then, this noise?
Is he a revolution, a riot of Anarchists? Ah, no! It are the book-
makers. The bookmakers in the midst of the ladies; Hold, it is
droll! And I pay one sov, to stand with those men there ! It is too
strong! I go more far, I pass the barrier, I am alone on the grass.
go to left. I see some men, in a cage of iron, who cry also.
It is—how say you?—“Tatersal.” Then, ah heaven, I arrive
at the true Pesage / Not of burgesses, not of villain beasts
of bookmakers, not even of “Tatersals.” But partout the ladies
the most beautiful, the most charming, the most adorable! It is
there I go! Even if I pay one sov., two sows., three sovs., I go!
I essay to enter. The policeman stops me. I say, “One pound?”
and I offer to him one sov. He looks all around, and then he says,
quite low, “No gocq, Sir-the inspector’s looking.” I say, “She is
good, that pound there, I assure you of it. Is there two to Fº.
And I hold one other. Then the inspector comes and says I bribe
the policeman. I say that no. He says that yes. I am furious.
I say I pay the entrance. He says, "Get off the course.” I refuse.
He pushes me. I resist. Other policemen push me. Just heaven,
they force me to go! I cannot resist. Then all the people in face
cry furiously. They shout Welshman 1" How they are stupid!
Can they think that I am a Welshman—me, AUGUSTE * Ah, that it
is droll . Then the policemen run, and I run also. I wish not to
run, but I am forced. And, in fine, we are at the railway station,
and they put me in a train, and I arrive to London at three o'clock.
See there all that I have seen of your races of Ascot, and I have

A RULE OF CONDUCT.
You say to a man what you couldn't write to him; and you
write to a man what you wouldn't say to him.—JAMES THE TRAN-
SCRAPS FROM CHAPS.
A FAMOUs old mill has been burned to the ground. None other
than that situate upon the river Dee, where a certain jolly miller
sang songs and earned the envy of “bluff King HAL.” in days of
old, wearing the white flour of a blameless life. He also wore a
white hat, for the purpose, it is said, of keeping his head warm.
The modern miller wears one in summer to keep his head cool. No
doubt he found it useful at the fire. Great thing to ...? a cool
head on such occasions. The mill has now been destroyed by fire
four times. There was an ancient prophecy, according to a local
paper, that it was doomed to be burned down three times. This
Delphic oracle would, of course, have inspired the simple gentlemen
of old Greece to give up insuring after the third fire. Probably the
modern “miller of the Dee” has committed a paradox, and profited
by a lofty disregard for his prophet.
ALL, Saints Church, Old Swan, is the first Liverpool church which
has adopted the innovation of lady choristers wearing the new
surplices and caps, which have been specially designed for their
use. The surplices are quite unlike those used by the clergy; they
are more like dolmans. The caps are of the shape worn by a D.C.L.,
and are made of violet velvet. One of the most cogent reasons for
their adoption is *g. by the Rev. Canon WILKINson, who,
as appears from the Sheffield and Rotherham Independent, writes
thus:-" Since these garments have been introduced, the offer-
tories in the church have been increased by at least one-third.”
INTERNATIONAL Discountesy:-The French law, it seems, requires
the owner of a yacht, in which he is himself sailing, to supply stores
of victual and drink for his crew. A French yacht put in at
Dartmouth, says the Field, and the Dartmouth Custom-house
officials darted down on her, and made the owner pay for what he
used of his own. “They manage these things better in France.”

A RULE OF CONDUCT.
You say to a man what you couldn't write to him; and you
write to a man what you wouldn't say to him.—JAMEs THE TRAN-
SCRAPS FROM CHAPS.
A FAMOUs old mill has been burned to the ground, None other
than that situate upon the river Dee, where a certain jolly miller
sang songs and earned the envy of “bluff King HAL.” in days of
old, wearing the white flour of a blameless life. He also wore a
white hat, for the purpose, it is said, of keeping his head warm.
The modern miller wears one in summer to keep his head cool. No
doubt he found it useful at the fire. Great thing to ...? a cool
head on such occasions. The mill has now been destroyed by fire
four times. There was an ancient prophecy, according to a local
paper, that it was doomed to be burned down three times. This
Delphic oracle would, of course, have inspired the simple gentlemen
of old Greece to give up insuring after the third fire. "Probably the
modern “miller of the Dee” has committed a paradox, and profited
by a lofty disregard for his prophet.
ALL, Saints Church, Old Swan, is the first Liverpool church which
has adopted the innovation of lady choristers wearing the new
surplices and caps, which have been specially designed for their
use. The surplices are quite unlike those used by the clergy; they
are more like dolmans. The caps are of the shape worn by a D.C.L.,
and are made of violet velvet. One of the most cogent reasons for
their adoption is expressed by the Rev. Canon WILKINson, who,
as appears from the Sheffield and Rotherham Independent, writes
thus:-" Since these garments have been introduced, the offer-
tories in the church have been increased by at least one-third.”
INTERNATIONAL Discourtesy:-The French law, it seems, requires
the owner of a yacht, in which he is himself sailing, to supply stores
of victual and’drink for his crew. A French yacht put in at
Dartmouth, says the Field, and the Dartmouth Custom-house
officials darted down on her, and made the owner pay for what he
used of his own. “They manage these things better in France.”
This would have been indeed, " a “Custom’ more honoured in

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
“WHo won the battle of Tel-el-Kebir?” “I, said Cock HAMLEY,
I won Tel-el-Kebir with my Highland Brigade.” Mr. INNEs SHAND's
life of General Sir E. B. HAMLEY (BLAckwood) is obviously pub-
lished, with chief intent of placing in permanent form HAMLEy's
claim in respect of this engagement. It is not a new story. It was
published to the world soon after the event in the }*. of a
monthly magazine. The article, a model of terse, lucid, yet pic-
turesque writing, is reproduced in these volumes. Whether accurate
in detailed assertion and induction, or coloured by strong feeling, it
is a melancholy story. Either HAMLEY was deliberately ignored in
the Commander-in-Chief's despatches after Tel-el-Kebir, or he was
under a remarkable hallucination. The affair is all the more curious
since Sir GARNET, WolsFLEY, as soon as he was appointed to the
Egyptian command, sought out HAMLEY and offered him the command
of one of the divisions of the expeditionary force. The secret of the
estrangement which soon developed between the two soldiers, is, my
Baronite suspects, to be found in the characteristic fact that the very
day the ship *. Sir GARNET WolsFLEY arrived at Alexandria,
HAMLEY went on board and proposed to show his chief how the enemy
should be attacked: “He did not seem to wish to pursue the subject,”
HAMLEY writes in his diary, “and I soon after took leave.” Other
incidents, which HAMLEY hotly resented, culminated in the despatch
to the War Qffice reporting the fight at Tel-el-Kebir, and ignoring
the Highland Brigade, which, in the view of its commander, had borne
version of the affair. Meantime it, gloomily stands forth in this
record of a strenuous but, on the whole, a disappointed life. It is
pleasant to, learn that HAMLEY gratefully recognised in one of
Mr. Punch's Cartoons a powerful incentive to the course of public
feeling which postponed his being shelved under the operation of the
scheme of compulsory retirement by reason of age. ...The most
charming passages in the book are the correspondence with the late
Mr. BLAckwood, who opened to General HAMLEY the avenue to
literary fame.
One of my Baronites of Irish extraction writes thusly:-"A Tale
of the Thames is the title of the Summer Number of The Graphic.
It is written by J. AsHBY-STERRY, and illustrated by WILLIAM
HATHERELL. The course of the story—or, rather, the watercourse of
the story—covers a good deal of ground, embracing as it does, on
both sides, most places of interest between the Source in Trewsbur
Mead, Gloucestershire, and Hampton Court.” Quoth the Baron, “
am all anxiety to see this tale of the Thames uncoil itself.”
The Baron welcomes a comparatively “handy” volume (“handy”
relative term, depending on size of hand) of reference, entitled, Men
and Women of the Time, new edition, brought out by Messrs.
GEORGE RouTLEDGE, edited by Mr. PLARR of Oxford; and the plat
that is set before the public and the Baron appears to be a thoroughl
satisfying one. “The first name for which, I naturally looked,”
uoth the Baron, “was that of RouTLEDGE himself, but searching
#. RossI, º: Roumania, to Row Both AM, nowhere did I light
upon the name of RouTLEDGE. Master MILLAIs is here, also MILLER,
likewise MILLs; but I do not see the name of the author of the
'Arry Papers, the inventor of ’ARRY in these columns, of immortal
fame. “Name him l’” In every other respect the compilers and
ublishers are to be congratulated, and do hereby stand congratu-
ated, on their work by the ever-appreciative BARON DE B.-W.

SIR,-The present enthusiasm for cricket and its distinguished

SIR,-I miss one important name from the Telegraph list of
subscriptions to Grace Testimonial. What is GRACE the Batsman
without T. G. Bowles?

SIR,-Here's something original. Lay out some of
the coin subscribed in purchasing for Dr. W. G., the
champion “Willow-wielder,” a set of “Willow-pattern
plates.” OLD CHINA.
P.S.-I happen to have by me a rare, almost invaluable
set, which I can dispose of at a certain figure.
SIR,--Dr. GRACE is now getting on for fifty. In an-
other four years he will complete his h century.
Therefore he is no chicken. Ergo, he may one day
have a duck's egg. I withhold my subscription, to
accumulate with interest, till that occurs.

DEAR SIR,-I think vou are quite right to encourage cricket, as it
is a noble game. The Duke of WELLINGTON once said that Trafalgar
was won on the Eton Playing-fields. I don't think he was quite
right there, as I have always been told that the battle was fought
abroad. I am last in my class, but I'm in the second Eleven. I'm
often “not out,” and to-day I’ve had to “stay in " all the time

You may take an Eastern Magnate to

difficulty get to lunch with the local
Mayor.
There is many a slip between the
Prince and the lift.
A, view of machinery in motion in
hand is worth two invitations to recep-
tions in prospective.
Cocked-hats of a feather flock together.
You cannot make pleasure out of the
address of a corporation.
All roads lead to turtle soup.
It is an ill wind that causes a swell on
the Ship Canal.
People who live in mosques ought not
to throw sticks at the Derby.
A programme kept to time is not
worth nine.
The early mayor has to wait longest.
Give a Highness a wrong title and
report him.
Enough at a factory is better than a
feast in a Town Hall.
It is a long explanation that has no
turning.
A jerk is as good as a nod to a bowing
multitude.
When a person of the first importance
enters by the door all settled arrange-
ments disappear through the window.
The Representative of an Illustrious
Race laughs at Traffic Managers.
The English Public enjoys a sensation,
but the Indian Empire pays for it.
When the Prince is away, to fill up
the time the band will play.

“A SALE | A SALE I’”
THE Price Sale of pictures on Saturday last at Christie's will be
ever memorable as “The Highest Price Sale.” “‘What’s the demd
total P’ was the first question Mr. Mantalini asked.” To which the
present answer is £87,144. A nice little sum to go on with, or off
with. One of the incidents was most dramatic. "GAINsborough's
“Lady Musgrave” was put up to be purchased. Then stood forward
bold WILLIAM AGNEw with eight thousand guineas in his best
gossamer. “The lady is mineſ” he exclaimed, rapturously, and
was advancing with arms outstretched to seize his prize, when sud-
denly his path was crossed by one CAMPBELL “of that ilk,” who cried
aloud, “Here are ten thousand golden sovereigns plus ten thousand
silver shillings, all glittering on a tray! Advance no further!”
And bold WILLIAM advanced no further. For once he was taken
aback. “I didna ken the CAMPBELL was coming !” muttered
WILLIAM A-bashed. And ere he could recover from his surprise,
and while yet his frame was quivering with excitement, his picture,
the Lady that should have been his, was gone. “They have given
her to another!” he sang sadly, but the next moment he pulled
himself together, and “taking heart of Grace”. WILLIAM made such
running, off his own bat, as would have astonished even the eminent
cricketer just mentioned. And the last of the “Reynolds' Mis-
cellany” in this collection succumbed to WILLIAM the Conqueror for
450 guineas. Sic transit gloria Saturday !

A FINE SUMMER DAY'S OUTING.
HIGHLY recommended by “The Faculty” (who has tried it more
than once). Given a pºſestly calm sea, a delicious light breeze, and
anything else “given” that you can get, including pleasant company,
then, with tears in your patriotic eyes, and a tremolo in your voice,
bid fareweli (for a couple of hours or so) to old England, cross the
Channel, invade France viá Calais, where, however calm the sea has
been, you must be prepared for a “buffet”; but this “buffet” is
not at all rough, just the contrary, and if by chance you should
have at all suffered from any unevenness in the wave line, you are
sure, on arriving, at Calais, of a “restauration” which will send
ou back in another hour and a half quite the giant refreshed:
#t same evening you can pose as a real traveller just returned
from “the Continent,” which will serve you excellently both as
reason and apology for not having answered any letters, and neglected
epistolary business generally during the last month. ... “Been away,
my boy!”. “Ah, that’s why you didn't answer my letter...Where
have you been P' 'Oh!, France, about Normandy. , Delightful.
Ta! Ta!” And perhaps the expenditure of the day's trip have
saved you from all sorts of trouble, pecuniary and otherwise, that
ou might have got into had you, remained at, home, answering
etters. But, as to the benefit of the sea air—there can't be two
opinions about that.

DEAR CHARLIE,--The pypers all tell us the
Season is now at its 'ight;
Don't mean one o' Thomson's, my pippin.
That josser is now out of dyte.
When I was a bit of a kiddie, dad’ad a old
brown-covered book
Into wich, now and, then, on a Sunday, 'e

Such § saloop, my dear CHARLIE, “em-
bellished” with rummy old cuts,
Drawn stiff and old-fashioned, by Stoth ARD.
On one on 'em though, I was nuts,
Musi- somethink or other Ifancy. But as
to the cackle, Great Scott!—
“The sun rolling bounteous from Aries,”
and reams o' such molly slop rot.
Now if JEMMy 'ad sung of our Season, not
Nature's old merry-go-round,
But London's pertikler, for swells, it'ud suit
me right down to the ground.
But as JEMMY has shirked it for tosh on
“ethereal mildness,” and such,
Wy’ARRY must’ave a cutin, and all London
is fly to his touch.
Wot a Summer we're 'aving this Season!
. All Nature seems trim and in tune;
Ripe strorberries picked out o' doors, though
we’ve 'ardly yet dropped into June;
The parks jest like bloomin' peraries, the
water supply going queer,
And a general 'urrying up for stror 'ats,
lemon squeshes, and beer.
It seems only yesterday, CHARLIE, the stand.
And “Are you froze off?” wos the question
of every poor pal you might meet. .
And now there’s a new “water famine”
along o' the 'eat, not the cold,
And ginger-pop's sellin' as fast as it can be
unbottled and sold.

“Mr. Murphy (warmly). I say

“(At this stage there was great
noise and confusion, several gentle-

“Chairman (very warmly, and

NAVAL ARCHITECTURE.
[A paper on “The Amplitude of Rolling on a Non-synchronous Wave” was
read before the Congress of Naval Architects in Paris.]
Last week, the papers tell us, the talented and zealous
Designers who construct our ships their best attention gave
Tº M. BERLIN's writing on what sounds to us exciting—
The amplitude of rolling when non-synchronous the wave.
How often, crossing over those distressing Straits of Dover,
Where flighty folks grow flabby and where giddy ones grow grave,
We have meditated sadly that we don't encounter gladly
The amplitude of rolling when non-synchronous the wave.
The amplitude—we'd bear it, and would probably not care, it
Seems but to be an adjunct which perhaps we might not crave.
For that exegrable rolling we require much more consoling,
That amplitude of rolling when non-synchronous the wave.

WHITEWASHING THE STATUE OF CROMWELL.
“CRoxwell,” wrote the Daily News on ARTHUR BALFour's
eech, “was the only man of his time who understood the prin-
ciples of religious freedom.” Ahem
“Papa,” said Polly Eccles, referring to certain charges brought
against her revered father, “Papa may have his faults, but he's a
rery clever man.” So the D. N. as to the Protector CROMWELL,
“OLIVER,” says the D. N. in effect, “being human, may have had
his faults, as had other men of his time, but he º understood
religious freedom.” . Did he? In Ireland for example? . With him
“religious freedom” was like the verb in grammar, either “ex-
pressed” or “understood.” It might have been." understood,” but
it certainly was not “expressed” in action. If CROMWELL was such
a model of “religious freedom,” then it will be as well to reconsider
history under Nero, DiocleTIAN, & Co., not to mention the amiable
Ninth CHARLEs of France, the genial HARRY THE EIGHTH of England,
the gentle PETER, Czar of All the Russias, and a few other kindly-dis-
posed rulers, who were, probably, the only men of their timethoroughly
understanding the principles of religious freedom. As the song º

date yourself to his little ways, or else so much the worse for one of
the two, and that one wouldn't have been OLIVERGROMwFLI. But, of
course, between principles and practise there is a “Great Divide.”
THE SHAHzADA, weary of London life and English enjoyment, will at
last exclaim with the canny Scot, “For pleasure gieme Peebles!” (The
original remark was made by the author of Peebles whom I have met.)

“Chairman (very warmly, and

LAST week, the papers tell us, the talented and zealous

To M. BERTIN's writing on what sounds to us exciting—
The amplitude of rolling when non-synchronous the wave.
Høy,often, crossing over those distressing Straits of Dover,
Where flighty folks grow flabby and where giddy ones grow grave,
We have meditated sadly that we don't encounter gladly
The amplitude of rolling when non-synchronous the wave.
The amplitude—we'd bear it, and would probably not care, it
Seems but to be an adjunct which perhaps we might not crave.
For that execrable rolling we require .# more consoling,

ToMMY had touched it up; BARTLEY had beamed over it; HANBURY
had hugged it. GREY's
last hour (of course in
Parliamentary sense) had
evidently come. He had
wriggl out of some
earlier man traps set for
him. This would settle
him.
And this is what GREY
said in reply: – “The
article of the Treaty of
Berlin relative to the point
raised by the hon, member
is the sixty-first.”
Only that, and nothing
more. The raven on the
pallid bust of PALLAs was
scarcely more disappoint-

a shocked pause; then

on UNDER SECRETARY,
crying, in chorus. Did

Never known such a thing done, and the like.
ToMMY jawed away, twisting TEMPLE round
the tip of his hook like a marlingspike on a
flying jibboom. Convinced him that public
duty called for sacrifice of private prejudices.
Having squared TEMPLE, ToMMy got men
near him to walk out before House was
counted, so as to reduce chances of quorum.
Bell rang; Members rushed in; Wºr,
huddled on Treasury Bench like flock of
frightened sheep. ToMMY, looking down
from shrouds in Strangers' Gallery, carefully
counted.
“Only thirty two,” he said. “Done it!”
But SPEAKER can count as well. “One-
two–four-fourteen—twenty-seven—thirty-
nine, forty,’” said he, with tone of conviction
that precluded contradiction.
“Blow me tight !” said, ToMMY, coming
out of the shrouds, a deathly pallor shining
through his tan. That was not his exact

remark.

erformance better, PLANÇon, once Jupiter now Mephistopheles,
the extremes meeting in one singer, excellent. MELBA quite the
German Fräulein. BEVIGNANI, C.B.,
i.e., “Conducting Beautifully,” in
the chair.
Tuesday.-Many other attractions,
yet heart is true to %. M. WICTOR
UREL, as Iago, adds another leaf
to his victor's wreath of Laurel.
MAGGIE MAGINTYRE makes, distinct
advance, and sings, “O Willow, we
have missed you” most melodiously.
TAM AGNO as Misther O'Tello, the
Irish darky singer, uncommonly
powerful. RICHARD GREEN, Mon-
fano, greener than ever: quite fresh.
PERcy MoRDY a good Roderigo Ran-
domo. The highly Pole-ish'd OLITZKA
a fair representative of Emilia. And
this cast, with Merry MANGINELLI
manipulating musicians, makes the
Opera a delight to the fine fleur of
the Covent Gardenian Hot House.
Wednesday.—House crammed to

money; her, singing makes up tºother two-thirds. , “Bonus” to
audience in “JHome, Sweet Home.” Wrapt attention | Here we are
all of us out for the night, so to speak, in silks and satins and jewels
rare, and with feathers and diamonds and all our war paint on, off
afterwards to routs, balls and supper-parties, and yet all hushed,
conscience-stricken as it were, in the midst of our gaiety, by sweet
voice warbling so distinctly “Home! Home! Home! Sweet Home!
Wherever (including the Opera Covent Garden) we wander (and we
can't wander when our attention is riveted on la Dira) there is
no-oh-o-o place like Ho-ome!” And then, second verse finished, a
storm of rapturous applause bursts over the singer! Yes! those are
our sentiments, “Home! Home!” by all means. Only—excuse us–
we “won't go Home Sweet Home tiſ morning, till daylight doth ap-
pear.” But why, ADELINA mia, didst thousing at the end of the Opera
that remarkably anti-climaxious waltz of TI-to-TUM MATTEI's PTI-
To-TUM all very well in his way, but not a RossINI. And then you
sang it from a paper in your hand as though doing penance in a music
sheet P A mistake, ADELINA, don’t do it again, spin your TI-To-TUM
at a concert, but not in RossINI's Barbiere. BERTHA BAUERMEISTER
obtained a rapturous encore, but shook her finger at the audience as
who would say “too latel too late!” So BEVIGNANI bowed, and on we
went again merrily. PINI-CoRs1 good as pantaloon Bartolo, ANCONA
a capital Figaro, looking like one of Cruikshank's comic characters,
'ARRY MUNDY, fine Basilio done in Italian oils; M.BoxNARD, light and
airy French count, more of larker than lover. All Home-Sweet-Home-
ing (or elsewhere) about midnight, many being detained by the singers
at the Opera from getting to #. SPEAKER’s “at Home,” Sweet Home,
Thursdag—Pagliacci, with Miss PAULINE, JORAN ºppº; 8.8
Nedda, and playing it in first-rate style. “Gee up! Nedda."
Query. PINI-Cohsi good as Tonio £ Answer. 'CoRSI was. T'others
not much, but Opera still charming. Yet this evening's programme
too trying for emotional persons. Pagliacci, tragedy; Cavalleria
Rusticana tragedy also; tragedy from º to end; even the
celebrated mezzo very like a wail! Not kind of DRURioLANUs to
afflict us thus. Madame BELLINcroNI, “the original Santuzza,”
admirable. Honours easy between Madame CALvić and BELLINCIONI.
The latter played it first abroad; but the former had the start of her
here. In some of the action peculiarly characteristic of the type,
BELLINCIONI wins, not by a neck, but by two hands. CALVf more
striking (hands down) in her jealous agony, Signor, WALENTINE
FIGAR0, ANCONA, excellent as Alfio; the situation when W1GNAs,
9ing strong as Turiddu, catches Alfio's ear, in order, as he says in
icilian, “Tu-rid-u of his presence” by subsequently killing him,
more dramatic than ever. GIULLA RAvogII admirable as quite the
gay Lola of the Sicilian Seven Dials. After intermezzo Bowing
BEVIGNANI declines encore.
Friday.-Child Harold allowed to sit up late for another night.
Composer Cow RN ought to sing, “I lovemy ALBANI with an A, because
she’s Admirable.” Harold improveth on representation. William
Malet played by RICHARD GREEN. Nice of the librettist, Sir
Edwarp MALET, to keep the memory of his ancestor Green. It must
make singers rather nervous to have the composer ris-à-vis con-
ducting his own work; as WAGSTAFF observes," in this instance it
must have the effect of Cowin' them.” 'Nother week gone.
A SIESTA.
How sleepy I feel!. It is this beastly influenza cold and headache.
The best thing to do for a headache, is to have a little doze and sleep
it off. Not a very easy thing to do in a big Paris hotel in the after-
noon. However, it is quiet enough in my room, looking on to the
courtyard, away from the noises of the Boulevard.
Just dropping off. Crash! º: shutting a door. That
is not an unusual sound. In these big hotels no one closes a door, no
one glides along a passage, no one speaks in a soft voice, but every-
one bangs, and stamps, and shouts. If it is a woman, she screams.
Another crash! The man in the next room just come in. That’s
the Frenchman with the awful cough. No one but a Frenchman
could haye a cough like that., Lie and listen to his cough for some
time. Warious other doors banged. But at last sink into uncon-
sciousness. Good Heavens! What’s happened now P. Oh, it's the
American trunks being dragged out of the room on the other side. I
Well, at any rate I shall not hear the American voices now through
that miserable door of communication, which, locked and bolted ever
so carefully, does not keep out sounds. But there is someone talking
there now. Of course the new comers. It must be two people. No,
twenty people. By Jove, they are Germans ! And there's the
Frenchman's cough again. I shall never get to sleep. Yet somehow
the sounds get confused, I fancy the Germans are coughing and the
Frenchman is saying “Ja, ja, ja,” and then—
There, now I am awake again. Why, there's someone knºcking
at the door. “Pardon, monsieur, avez-vous reçu votre linge f"
“Mais, oui, je l'ai regu hier.”, “Pardon, monsieur, il y a des faux-
cols.” “Non, je les ai regus tous.” “Mais, monsieur-.” “Mais
qu'est-ce que vous me chantez la 2 Laissez-moi tranquille.” “Mais,
monsieur, le monsieur en face m'a dit que monsieur a reºu des
faux-cols que monsieur—” ... Confound the collars. Get up,
let in the garçon, examine my collars and the collars of the monsieur
en face, who is just packing up, rectify the mistake of the washer-
woman, and am again alone. Now is it worth going to sleep or not?
Will try once more.
What’s that ? (“MARIE l’’. It’s someone shouting outside my
door. How fond they are of shouting outside my door! “MARIEl
De l'eau chaude.” I hope she won't think it's for me, or she'll
wake me up if at last I get a chance of dropping off. Then silence.
Positively, absolute silence. The coughing Frenchman must have
been suffocated; the Germans—no, nothing could stop the Germans
from talking, only they have gone out of hearing. And the£".
de chambre has hurried off to fetch that hot water for somebody, and
the garçon is not banging his broom about in this couloir, and there
is no baggage coming or going, and no door crashing; and, in the
midst of profound peace, I think drowsily of quiet country after-
noons, when one hears only the humming of the bees, and the
whispering of the aspens, and then, and then— Hullo | What’s
up now * There's someone else knocking. My last chance gone.
My head is aching more than ever. “Eh bien 2° “C'est l'eau

Monday.—Tannhäuserites disappointed. Signor WIGNAs indis-
#. Tannhäuser's understudy Faust put up. House good.
erformance better. PLANÇon, once Jupiter now Mephistopheles,
the extremes meeting in one singer, excellent. MELBA quite the
German Fräulein. BEVIGNANI, C.B.,
i.e., “Conducting Beautifully,” in
the chair. -
Tuesday.-Many other attractions,
yet heart is true to Opera. M. WICToh
AUREL, as Iago, adds another leaf
to his victor's wreath of Laurel.
MAGGIE MAGINTYRE makes, distinct
advance, and sings, “O ow, we
have missed you” most melodiously.
TAM AgNo as Misther O'Tello, the
Irish darky singer, uncommonly
powerful. RICHARD GREEN, Mon-
tano, greener than ever: quite fresh.
PERcy MoRDY a good Roderigo Ran-
domo. The highly Pole-ish'd OLITzkA
a fair representative of Emilia. And
this cast, with Merry MANCINELLI
manipulating musicians, makes the
Opera a delight to the fine fleur of
the Covent Gardenian Hot House.
Wednesday.—House crammed to
See and hear AprilNAPATTI as Rosina
Pagliacci in the ever delightful Barbiere di
agilaccl. Siriglia. RossINI for ever! “Whar’s
your WULLIE WAGNER noo?” PATTI's acting worth a third of the
money; her singing makes up tºother two-thirds. “Bonus” to
audience in “Home, Sweet Home.” Wrapt attention! Here we are
all of us out for the night, so to speak, in ºilks and satins and jewels
rare, and with feathers and diamonds ard all our war paint on, off
afterwards to routs, balls and supper-parties, and yet all hushed,
Conscience-stricken as it were, in the midst of our gaiety, by sweet
voice warbling so distinctly “Home! Home! Home! Sweet Home!
Wherever (including the Opera Covent Garden) we wander (and we
can't wander when our attention is riveted on la Dira) there is
no-oh-o-o place like Ho-ome!” And then, second verse finished, a
storm of rapturous applause bursts over the singer! Yes! those are
our sentiments, “Home! Home!” by all means. Only—excuse us—
we “won't go Home sweet Home ti morning, till daylight doth ap-
pear.” But why, ADELINA mia, didst thousing at the end of the Opera
that remarkably anti-climaxious waltz of TI-to-TUMMATTEI's PTI-
To-Tuy all very well in his way, but not a RossINI. And then you
sang it from a paper in your hand as though doing penance in a music
sheet? A mistake, ADELINA, don't do it again, spin your TI-To-TUM
at a concert, but not in RossINI's Barbiere. BERTHA BAUERMEISTER
obtained a rapturous encore, but shook her finger at the audience as
who would say “too late! too late!” So BEvig NANI bowed, and on we
went again merrily. PINI-CoRs1 good as pantaloon Bartolo. ANCONA
a capital Figaro, looking like one of Cruikshank's comic characters.
'ABRY MUNDY, fine Basilio done in Italian oils; M. BoxNARD, light and
airy French count, more of larker than lover. All Home-Sweet-Home-
ing (or elsewhere) about midnight, many being detained by the singers
at the Opera from getting to #. SPEAKER’s “at Home,” Sweet Home.
Thursday.— Pagliacci, with Miss PAULINE, JoRAN ºppº, as
Nedda, and playing it in first-rate style. “Gee upſ Nedda.”
Query. PINI-Cohsi good as Tonio f Answer. 'CoRs1 was. T'others
not much, but Opera still charming. Yet this evening's programme
too trying for emotional persons. Pagliacci, tragedy; Cavalleria
Rusticana tragedy also; tragedy from beginning to end; even the
celebrated mezzo very like a wail! Not kind of DRURIolanus to
afflict us thus. Madame BELLINgroNI, “the original Santuzza,”
admirable. Honours easy between Madame CALvá and BELLINcion1.
The latter played it first abroad; but the former had the start of her
here. In some of the action peculiarly characteristic of the type,
BELLINCIONI wins, not by a neck, but by two hands. CALvić more
striking (hands down) in her jealous agony, Signor, WALENTINE
FIGARO ANCONA excellent as Alfio; the situation when WIGNAs,
§ strong as Turiddu, catches Alfio's ear. in order, as he says in
icilian, “Tu-rid-u of his presence” by subsequently killing him,
more dramatic than ever. GIULLA RAvogII admirable as quite the
gay Lola of the Sicilian Seven Dials. After intermezzo Bowing
BEv1GNANI declines encore. -
Friday.-Child Harold allowed to sit up late for another night.
Composer Cow RN ought to sing, “I lovemy ALBANI with an A, because
she's Admirable.” Harold improveth on representation. William
Malet played by RICHARD GREEN. Nice of the librettist, Sir
Edwarp MALET, to keep the memory of his ancestor Green. It must

can't wander when our attention is riveted on la Dira) there is

A SIESTA.
How sleepy I feel!. It is this beastly influenza cold and headache.
The best thing to do for a headache is to have a little doze and sleep
it off. Not a very easy thing to do in a big Paris hotel in the after-
noon. However, it is quiet enough in my room, looking on to the
courtyard, away from the noises ; the Boulevard.
Just dropping off. Crash l Only someone shutting a door. That
is not an unusual sound. In these big hotels no one closes a door, no
one glides along a passage, no one speaks in a soft voice, but every-
one bangs, and stamps, and shouts. "If it is a woman, she screams.
Another crash! The man in the next room just come in. That’s
the Frenchman with the awful cough. No one but a Frenchman
could haye a cough like that., Lie and listen to his cough for some
time. Various other doors banged. But at last sink into uncon-
sciousness. Good Heavens! What’s happened now? Oh, it’s the
American trunks being dragged out of the room on the other side.
Well, at any rate I shall not hear the American voices now through
that miserable door of communication, which, locked and bolted ever
so carefully, does not keep out sounds. But there is someone talking
there now. Of course the new comers. . It must be two people. No,
twenty people. By Jove, they are Germans ! And there's the
Frenchman's cough again, I shall never get to sleep. Yet somehow
the sounds get confused, I fancy the Germans are coughing and the
Frenchman is saying “Ja, ja, ja,” and then—-
There, now I am awake again. Why, there's someone knºcking
at the door. . . Pardon, monsieur, arez-vous reçu cotre linge?”
“Mais, oui, je l'ai regu hier.”, “Pardon, monsieur, il y a des faux-
cols.” “Non, je les ai regus tous.” “Mais, monsieur-” “Mais
qu'est-ce que vous me chantez la f Laissez-moi tranquille.” “Mais,
monsieur, le monsieur en face m'a dit que monsieur a reºu des
faux-cols que monsieur—” ... Confound the collars l Get up,
let in the garçon, examine my collars and the collars of the monsieur
en face, who is just packing up, rectify the mistake of the washer-
woman, and am again alone. Now is it worth going to sleep or not?
Will try once more.
What's that? “MARIEl". It’s someone shouting outside my
door. How fond they are of shouting outside my door! “MARIEl
De l'eau chaude.” I hope she won't think it's for me, or she’ll
wake me up if at last I get a chance of dropping off. Then silence.
Positively, absolute silence. The coughing Frenchman must have
been suffocated; the Germans—no, nothing could stop the Germans
from talking, only they have gone out of hearing. And theº
de chambre has hurried off to fetch that hot water for somebody, and
the garçon is not banging his broom about in this couloir, and there
is no baggage coming or going, and no door crashing; and, in the
midst of profound peace, I think drowsily of quiet country after-
noons, when one hears only the humming of the bees, and the
whispering of the aspens, and then, and then— Hullo! What’s
up now * There's someone else knocking. My last chance gone.
My head is aching more than ever. “Eh bien º’ “C'est l'eau
chaude que vous avez commandée, Monsieur.”

[June 29, 1895.
SOCIETY'S NEXT CRAZE.
(As foreseen by Mr. Punch's Second-sighted Clairvoyant.)
It is the summer of 1896–or possibly '97. The scene is a road skirt-
ing Victoria Park, Bethnal Green, which Society's leaders
have recently discovered and appointed as the rendez-vous for
the Season, and where it is now the correct thing for all really
smart people to indulge, between certain prescribed hours, in
sports and pastimes that have hitherto been more characteristic
of the masses than the classes. The only permissible mount
now is the donkey, which must be ridden close to the tail, and
arrives from the West End every morning about eleven to watch
the brilliant parade of “Mokestrians” (as the Society journalist
will already have decided to call them). Some drive slowly up
and down on coster-barrows, attended by cockaded and dis-
gusted grooms. About twelve, they break up into light luncheon
*:::::: after which they play democratic games for half an
our or so, and drive home
on drags.
Mr. Woodby-Innett (to the
Donkey Proprietor). Kept a
moke for me? I told you I
should be wantin' one every
mornin' now.
The Donkey Proprietor (after
consulting engagement - book).
I’ve not got it down on my list,
Sir. Very sorry, but the Coun-
tess of CUMBERBACK has just
booked the last for the 'ole of
this week. Might let you 'ave
one by-and-by, if, Sir HAscot
Goodwood brings his in punc-
tual, but I can’t promise it.
Mr. Woodby-Inn. That’s no
good; no point in ridin' after
the right time. (To himself, as
he turns away.) Nuisancel
Not that I’m so keen about a
moke. Not a patch on a bike!
—though it don't do to say so.
Only if I'd known this, I’d
have turned upin a tall hat and
frock coat; and then I could
have taken a turn on the steam-
circus. Wonder if it would be
any sort of form shyin' at cocoa-
nuts in tweeds and a straw hat.
Must ask some chap who knows.
More ºl. what to put on this

Well, I dessay I can come along presently, Lady 'URLINGHAM, and
fetch'ima whack or two; jest now I can't, having engaged to come and
'old the Marshiness of 'AMMERCLoth's on 'er moke; but there, you
orter be able to git along well enough by yourself now—you ought !
Captain Sonbyrne (just home on leave from India—to Mrs.
CHESHAM-Lowndes). Rather an odd sort of idea this—I mean,
coming all the way out here to ride a lot of donkeys, eh?
Mrs. Chesham-Lowndes. It used to be rather amusing a month
ago, before they all got used to riding so near the tail; but now
they’re all so good at it, don't you know.
. Capt., Sonb. I went down to Battersea Park yesterday to see the
bicyclists. Not a soul there, give you my word!
rs. Q.-L. No; there wouldn't be this season, ...You see, all sorts
and conditions of people began to take it up, and it got too fearfully
common. And now moke-riding has quite cut it out.
Capt. Somb. But why ride donkeys when you can get gees?
Mrs. C.-L. Oh, well, they're democratic, and cheap, and all that,
don't you know, And one really can't be seen on a horse this year-
in town, at least. . In the country it don't matter so much.
First Mokestrian (to second ditto). Hullo, old chap, so you've
taken to a moke at last, eh? How are you gettin' on ?
Second Mokestrian. Pretty well, I can sit on his tail all right
now, but I can't get into the way of keepin’ my heels off the ground

Off the Elbe, Wednesday
As of TO}Y.}{..}.
Afternoon.- Got up steam,
weighed anchor and laid our
course East by North half
South for Hamburg. Don
CURRIE, whose knowledge of
ocean life is extensive and
peculiar, tells me no well
regulated ship puts to sea
withoutfirst ascertaining the
weight of her anchor. Much
interested at this peep into
nautical life. But what has
the weight of the anchor to
do with the voyage of the
Tantallon Castle, or even
with the opening of the
Baltic Canal? Well, the
Don is not sue. Anyhow, it is an old custom. Sailors are super-
stitious, and if this preliminary to a voyage were omitted, the
would turn rusty, and might even want to throw someone overboard.
So, to prevent possible unpleasantness, the anchor is weighed—“To
an ounce,” Don CURRIE says º - -
Suppose before we turn in we shall be told how much it weighs.
Wish I knew what is the average weight of a really good anchor.
So awkward, if a man comes upon you, suddenly, and says, “The
anchor weighs just over a ton”; or “What do you think? the
anchor turns the scale at fifty-two lbs. ten dwt.”. Is one too much,
and is the other surprisingly little? Haven't the slightest idea.
Shall, in either case, say “Ha!” That is, at any rate, non-
committal. - - - -
Mr. G. will know what an anchor ought to weigh in given circum-
stances. . He knows everything. Shall try and find opportunity of
asking him.
IIamburg, Friday, 5 A.M.–"I am very fond of the German
tongue,” said the Member for SARK, paying me an early morning
pyjama-call., “The language in which Goethe wrote and HEINE
sang is sacred. Still, when it is emitted from the throats of half a
score of steam-whistles, one feels there are limits to passionate
desire. Have often heard siren, song of steam-whistle in and about
the Thames. That's bad enough for the sensitive ear. , But when it
comes to steam-whistling in German, you begin to understand why
people sometimes commit suicide.”
or my part, I like it. Few things more charming than to be
wakened at daybreak by a steam-whistle spluttering in your larboard
ear. Before you have quitedrank in the fulness of the music, another
shrieks in your starboard ear. Then, far and near, all round the
harbour, they popoff in different keys, . Some angry; some whining;
some in anguishing pain; some mocking; some wailing; one inge-
nious contrivance, moved by a master-hand, managing to imitate a
burst of maniacal laughter, in which, if you didn't bury your head
in the pillow, you feel you must join.
. Then there's the effect on the man on deck. Don't know who he
is ; fancy he must be the Supercargo. At first shriek of the earliest
whistle, he puts on the heaviest boots (those with the clump of steel
at the toes, the wedges of iron at the heel, and fat-headed nails all
over the sole). He gives preliminary stamp precisely over your head;
all right; steam-whistle shrieks; others respond; Supercargo is off;
stamps to and fro just the length of the deck immediately over your
berth; leaps up height of two feet; drops exactly over your head;
steam-whistles go faster; Supercargo clatters off; fetches from
somewhere a plank, a rough-hewn plank studded with nails; this
he dashes on the deck over your head; got the range to a nicety;
never misses; steam-whistles go off simultaneously; maddening
£ffect on Supercargo; he º: to and fro, charges over your berth,
banging the plank with mad delight. You get out of your berth,
dash to side; just going to plunge over; when Quartermaster seizes
you and leads you back to cabin, locking you in.

as we smoked cigars with our coffee; “but to my mind, the place to
spend a happy day is the Tantallon Castle.”
“There is,” I said, “the drawback of the absence of shrimps. But
then even kings cannot have everything.”
“True, Tobee,” said the grandfather of our kings-to-be and of
other people's. And for a moment the royal brow was “sicklied
o'er with pale cast of thought.”
It cleared as he caught sight of our two rival Kodakesses, who had
simultaneously got him in focus. Pretty to see King arrange his
hair, give little twist to moustache, and assume look of abstraction,
just as common people do when they suspect someone is taking a
snap-shot at them. As SARK says, “One snap of the Kodak makes
the whole world kin.”
Oddly enough, there were speeches at the luncheon..., Mr...G.
having got his hand (or rather his yoice) in at mouth of the Elbe,
delivered two charming addresses. One in proposing health of King
and Queen of DENMARK, the other in responding to toast to his own
health, given by King. A new thing this for Old Parliamentar
Hand to serve as after-dinner speaker. Listening to his graceful,
gracious phrases, one almost regrets he should have given up so
much time to Irish Land Bills, Home Rule, and the like.
After luncheon a stroll on deck, and, incidentally, a memorable
scene. In addition to the Kodakesses, who have taken everyone on
board, except each other, we have a regular artist with a camera.
Don CURRIr, having a moment to spare, thought he would have his
likeness taken. Got into position; operator's head under the cloth
fixing him; in another moment it would have been done. As
SHAKSPEARE wrote long ago, “Nothing escapes the eye of royal
Denmark.” The King, seeing what was going on, quietly led up the
Queen, and stood by her in focus; the rest of the Royal Family, as
our toast lists have it, closed in, forming a group near the Don; and
when the astonished operator removed the cap and exposed the plate
he found upon it the Royal Family of Denmark and one simple High-
land gentleman distinguished in such company by his plain estate.
In afternoon, Don CURRIE having entertained Kings and Queens
ard Crown Princes, threw open all the gangways of the ship to the
people of Copenhagen. They flocked in by hundreds, increasing to
thousands. In endless streams they passed along the decks peerin
and poking their noses into every nook and cranny. Qu upper dec
they had a great find. Sitting in his state cabin, with door open,
was Mr. G. reading
about the Wikings in
their own tongue,
which he has lately
added to his list of
acquired foreign lan-
guages. The Danes,
men, women, and
children, stood there
at gaze. Mr. G., with
his back turned to
door, read on, un-
: noticing. Crowd
growing unmanage-
able with ever-in-
} creasing numbers, a
handy quartermaster
rigged out ropes, and
made sort of hand-
rail, guarding either
side of cabin, keeping
back crowd. But it
filled the deck all
through the after-
noon, ever changing,
but ever one in its
passionate, yet patient
desire to catch a
glimpse of that figure
in the cabin, that went
on reading, as if the
world outside were a
mere wilderness.
Wednesday-At Kiel. Harbour and approaches filled with fleets
of all nations, every ship bristling with guns, and longing to be at
somebody. For the closing years of the nineteenth century of the
Christian Era, this is, as SARK says, most encouraging. . It is the
completest achievement, the proudest thing civilisation has to show us.
An admirable spot for a little quiet, reading,
although perhaps the firing does make it a leetle
difficult to concentrate one's thoughts wholly upon
the matter in hand.

the wasteful past. - -
Commentary No. 2 (supplied by a military writer). That civi-

THE German EMPEROR having expressed a wish to visit a non-
existing island at Hamburg, the tasteful citizens have constructed
one by means of wirework, canvas, plaster, and cement.
It is stated that the SULTAN is bored by the Bosphorus. The whole
surface of the water will therefore be covered with planks, painted
green, to represent meadows.
The KING of the BELGIANs is said to have remarked that Brussels
would be improved by a distant view of the sea. The municipal
authorities propose to cover the high, ground, seen from the palace
windows, with tin-foil. It is hoped that this will give the effect of
the sea gleaming in the sunshine.
The PRESIDENT of the French Republic having thought that it
would be a pleasing compliment to Russia if some specimens of
Russian architecture could be erected in Paris, it is believed that the
Commission des Monuments Historiques will cover the Louvre with
laths and canvas, painted to represent the Kremlin, and by similar
means will transform the Champs Elysées into the Nevsky Prospect,
and will give to Notre Dame the appearance of the forts at Cronstadt.
The KHEDIVE has expressed an opinion that the Pyramids look old
and shabby. If the English and French government will authorise
the expenditure, the whole surface of the stone will be made perfectly
smooth, will be painted and grained in imitation of oak, and will
finally be varnished. The face of the §. will be washed, and will
then be used for an advertisement of an English soap. The enormous
rent paid for this will be added to the KHEDIVF's pocket money.
The Queen of Holland is dissatisfied with the flat surroundings of
the Hague. It has been pointed out to HER MAJESTY that the city
contains a hill, called, we believe, the Wijverberg, which rises at
least three feet above the level of the sea, but she has replied that
this is not enough. It is therefore proposed to surround the whole
city with a gigantic panorama of the Bernese Oberland.
. The other day the King of SPAIN perceived a reflection of the moon
in a º and was much annoyed when his attendants failed to bring
it to him. It has now been arranged that all the ponds in the neigh-
bourhood shall contain an aluminium moon, which can be pulled out

THE Witness Protection Society and General Legal Reform Union

objects of this estimable body the chief appears to be to protect wit-
nesses in law courts from insult by counsel. Captain PARK15, having
expressed himself as willing, was voted to the chair, and the mem:
bers settled down to have a good time. “Heated discussion,”
“further disturbance,” and a well-sustained fire of “protests,” lent
an air of gaiety to the proceedings, which culminated in “various
entlemen abusing one another across the table.” With such excel-
ent practice, the members of the W. P. S. G. L. R. U. should be
able to hold their own in court. The Bar trembles. Even the Bench

SOCIETY'S NEXT CRAZE.
(As foreseen by Mr. Punch's Second-sighted Clairvoyant.)
It is the summer of 1896–or possibly '97. The scene is a road skirt-
ing Victoria Park, Bethnal Green, which Society's leaders
have recently discovered and appointed as the rendez-vous for
the Season, and where it is now the correct thing for all really
smart people to indulge, between certain prescribed hours, in
sports and pastimes that have hitherto been more characteristic
of the masses than the classes. The only permissible mount
now is the donkey, which must be ridden close to the tail, and
referred to as a “moke.” A crowd of well-turned-out spectators
arrives from the West End every morning about eleven to watch
the brilliant parade of “Mokestrians” (as the Society journalist
will already have decided to call them). Some drire slowly up
and down on coster-barrows, attended by cockaded and dis-
gusted grooms. About twelve, they break up into light luncheon
arties; after which they play democratic games for half an
our or so, and drive home
on drags.
Mr. Woodby-Innett (to the
Donkey Proprietor). Kept a
moke for me? I told you I
should be wantin' one every
mornin' now.
The Donkey Proprietor (after
consulting engagement - book).
I’ve not got it down on my list,
Sir. Very sorry, but the Coun-
tess of CUMBERBACK has just
booked the last for the 'ole of
this week. Might let you 'ave
one by-and-by, if, Sir HAscot
Goodwood brings his in punc-
tual, but I can't promise it.
Thr. Woodby-Inn. That’s no
good; no point in ridin' after
the right time. (To himself, as
he turns away.) Nuisancel
Not that I'm so keen about a
moke. Not a patch on a bike!
—though it don't do to say so.
Only if I'd known this, "I’d
have turned upin a tall hat and
frock coat; and then I could
have taken a turn on the steam-
circus. Wonder if it would be
any sort of form shyin' at cocoa-
nuts in tweeds and a straw hat.
Must ask some chap who knows.
More puzzlin' what to put on this
year than ever!
Lady Ranela Hurlingham
(breathlessly to Donkey Pro-
rietor). That’s mine, isn't it?
ill you please * me up, and
romise me you’ll keep close be-
# and make him run. (Sup-
pliantly.) You will, won't you ?
The Donkey Proprietor (with
a due sense of his own ralue).
Well, I dessay I can come along presently, Lady’URLINGHAM, and
fetch'ima whack or two; jest now I can't, having engaged to come and
'old the Marshiness of 'AMMERCLoth's on 'er moke; but there, you
orter be able to git along well enough by yourself now—you ought!
Captain Sonbyrne (just home on leave from India—to Mrs.
CHESHAM-Lowndes). Rather an odd sort of idea this—I mean,
coming all the way out here to ride a lot of donkeys, eh?
Mrs. Chesham-Lowndes. It used to be rather amusing a month
ago, before they all got used to riding so near the tail; but now
they’re all so good at it, don't you know.
. Capt., Sonb. I went down to Battersea Park yesterday to see the
bicyclists. Not a soul there, give you my word!
rs. Q.-L. No; there wouldn't be this season, ...You see, all sorts
and conditions of people began to take it up, and it got too fearfully
common. And now moke-riding has quite cut it out.
Capt. Somb. But why ride donkeys when you can get gees?

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
Messes. ARKweight, CUNLIFFE, and WARNER have received
their blues from the Captain of the Oxford University Eleven. In
- other words, these gentlemen will
represent their University in the cricket
match against Cambridge. My congratula-
tions, though they come late, are none the
less heart; and sincere. Can any years of
success in after life efface the memory or
outrival the delight of that crowded moment
of glorious life which comes to a young man
when his Captain tells him he may get his
blue? Thenceforward he is made one with
the great company of old blues, who year by
ear meet and exchange reminiscences, the
onour of his University is in his hands, his
father becomes less rigorous in his financial
views, and his mother is confirmed in her
opinion that her darling is the brightest
- and best and handsomest of created beings.
These keen joys come but once in a lifetime, and only to a few.
THAT man's a good bat who can time, judge, and mark right
The ball as it flies from the right hand of ARKwRIGHT.
And the Oxford men cheer as they see the stumps fall
When the Magdalen bowler delivers the ball.
...My team,” said G. MoRDAUNT, “requires only one lift;
If I get it the Cantabs may go and be Cunliffed.”
And I think he was wise in awarding, don't you,
To this tricky left-handed young boºler his #.
And lastly the Captain, he put in his thumb,
For he very much wanted to pull out a plum:
‘‘I have it,” he cried, like a modern Jack Horner,
And he promptly scored one as he pulled out Plum WARNER.
WHEN I was a freshman at Cambridge (eheu fugaces !) I remem-
ber being both, impressed and terrified at having pointed out to me
a tutor of a certain College who was said to be the hero of a Baccha-
malian incident. The story went that the tutor, returning from
some feast with a Fº of friends, fell, by mischance, into one of the
narrow streams of water that flow at the side of the Cambridge
streets; Striking out vigorously, he shouted, “Save the rest, I can
swim.” No doubt the story is still told, for the supposed hero of it
is still alive. Indeed, when a caricature of him was published some
years ago in Wanity. Fair, the biography by JEHU JUNIOR closed
with the words, “He can swim.” et the story, as affecting
Mr. DASH, of Blank College, is manifestly false, for it is older than
the century. The curious may find it in its original form in the
lately published volume ºf S. T., CoreRIDGE's letters. The poet
relates it of an undergraduate of his day who had taken partin a
drunken revel.
But the ways of, stories are at all times inscrutable. I have
myself-I confess it without a blush—deliberately invented and
spread abroad a story about a semi-public dinner. did so merely
because it struck me as containing elements of humour. Besides, it
not : might have happened, but ought to have happened. . A year
of two later six gentlemen, who had been present when the incident
did nºt ºccur, related it back to me, each one with a little special
embellishment of his own. Some of them were magistrates, most of
them were fathers of families, and all were honourable men. Yet
they were all prepared to stake their reputations on the absolute
yeracity of this myth; and, what is even more curious, they retailed
it to its inventor and dissºminator.
Lyſham is troubled. I read that “the musical attractions at the
Pier Pavilion have been fairly patronised, and dancing on the pier is
to be resumed.” This latter attraction, it ap , has not met with
the entire approval of the Lytham people, who contend that it will
bring Lytham into *:::::::: “The Ratepayers' Association have had
the matter under consideration, and have disclaimed any connection
with the innovation. The directors, however, have had the question
under discussion, and have decided to continue the dancing.”
SAID the pier-man to the tourist, “Lo, the tide is flowing free;
Won't you come and join the dancers in our Temple by the sea?
See how mazily the arries and the Harriets advance,
Will you won't you, will you won't you, won't you join the dance?
'We have cornets, flutes and fiddles, and we always play in time,
And the triangles at intervals triangularly chime.
Hark, the bold bassoon is booming, every dancer gets a chance,
Come and trip it, pretty tourist, in our gay Pavilion dance.”
But thetourist pausedamoment; then addressed the pier-man, “Brute,
help to |Tak
Besides, I'm here for pleasure, and I do not want to range;
As the rest of them are doing, in your gay al fresco dance.”
And the ratepayers considered it, and angrily replied,
‘'There is another shore, you know, upon the other side:
eyour dancers far from England, take them bodily to France;
We disclaim the least connection, and we will not join your dance.”
I NoTE from a co ndence in The Scotsman that a considerable
amount of feeling has aroused by the erection of the new North
British Railway Hotel in Princes Street, Lord WEMYss, a ently
has declared not only that it will spoil the view, but also that it will
“pierce the vault of heaven.” Another correspondent adds that it
will have “a Jennerised, unreposeful front.” at ought to settle I
the matter at once. Someone else complains of “those terrible
advertisements of drugs, and fluid beef which extend, in gigantic
letters along the side of the lower part of the Carlton Hill, and which
catch the unwilling eye of anyone looking from the Bridges, from the

MR. C. J. WALToN, of Wolverhampton, writes to the Birmingham
Daily Gazette with reference to a recent appeal on behalf of the
victims of the “Liberator” frauds. “Ifailentirely to see,” he says,
“how a member of the Church of England can be expected to make
the slightest sacrifice (except on the principle of Christian charity)
seeing that the whole idea of the “Liberator’ scheme was, to find
unds for the agitators whose sole aim was the robbery and destruc-
tion of the Church of England as a national institution, and to get
hold of its funds for secular and non-religious purposes.” Dear me,
dear me, how strange, how terrible, how muddle-headed. This poor
politician has eviden y got mixed up between the Liberator and the
“Liberation Society.” Let him take the hint, and send in his

The Conrict Ship, CLARK RUSSELL's latest novel (CHATTo AND
WINDUs), is redolent of the sea. There is no writer, not forgetting
MARRYAT, who has such close companionship with the sea in its
multiple forms and its many moods. The temptation to transfer
some of the ever-varying pictures of the
sea which, sparkle in these pages, is great
but must be resis Here is a glimpse of
night at chosen not because it is best,
but because it is shortest:-
“The mighty shadow of the ocean night was
majestic and awful, with the wild, flashful
colouring of lighthing in the south, and the
dustlike multitude of stars over the three
glooming spires of our ship.”
One would tº: that, sitting down to
write, CLARK RUSSELL had just come home
from a long trip foreign, or at least lived his
life somewhere within sight and sound of
the sea. The pity of it is, my Baronite
tells me, that this incomparable student of
the sea, of ships that go down upon the
waters, and of those who people them, lies
at anchor on his sofa in an inland town. He has not looked upon
the sea for a dozen years, nor smelt its brine, nor watched a ship
coming or going. This makes the more marvellous the power of
description of sea life in all its forms here displayed. Beyond this
special gift, fascinating to some º Mr. Russell has a sto
to tell, a good stout sea story, full of life and adventure, throug
the devious movements of which we meet real men and one woman.
Remembering that CLARK Russell, now ranks as a veteran novelist
it is pleasant to bear testimony to the fact that he seems to have save
his best wine to the last. The Convict Ship is, take it from stem to
stern, the best work he has yet turned out. Tinº B. D. B.W.
“N.B.”—Glasgow will have to look after its parks. Here is the
Town Council actually dreaming of “feuing” some of “the recently-

pyjama-call. “The language in which Goeth E wrote and HEINE
sang is sacred. Still, when it is emitted from the throats of half a
score of steam-whistles, one feels there are limits to passionate
desire. Have often heard siren song of steam-whistle in and about
the Thames. That’s bad enough for the sensitive ear. But when it
comes to steam-whistling in German, you begin to understand why

harbour, they pop off in different keys, . Some angry; some whining;
some in anguishing pain; some mocking; some wailing; one inge-

at the toes, the wedges of iron at the heel, and fat-headed nails all
over the sole). He gives preliminary stamp precisely over your head;

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI,
“You talk about your Roshervilles, cher ToBEE,” his Majesty said,
as we smoked cigars with our coffee; “but to my mind, the place to
spend a happy day is the Tantallon Castle.” -
“There is,” I said, “the drawback of the absence of shrimps. But
then even kings cannot have everything.”
“True, Tobee,” said the grandfather of our kings-to-be and of
other people's. And for a moment the royal brow was “sicklied
o'er with pale cast of thought.”
It cleared as he caught sight of our two rival Kodakesses, who had
simultaneously got him in focus. Pretty to see King arrange his
hair, give little twist to moustache, and assume look of abstraction,
just as common people do when they suspect someone is taking a
snap-shot at them. As SARK says, “One snap of the Kodak makes
the whole world kin.”
Oddly enough, there were speeches at the luncheon. Mr. G.
having ſº his hand (or rather his yoice) in at mouth of the Elbe,
delivered two charming addresses. One in proposing health of King
and Queen of DENMARK, the other in responding to toast to his own
health, given by King. A new thing this for Old Parliamentar
Hand to serve as after-dinner speaker. Listening to his graceful,
gracious phrases, one almost regrets he should have given up so
much time to Irish Land Bills, Home Rule, and the like.
After luncheon a stroll on deck, and, incidentally, a memorable
scene. In addition to the Kodakesses, who have taken everyone on
board, except each other, we have a regular artist with a camera.
Don CURRIr, having a moment to spare, thought he would have his
likeness taken. Got into position; operator's head under, the cloth
fixing him; in another moment it would have been done. As
SHAKSPEARE wrote, long ago, “Nothing escapes the eye of royal
Denmark.” The King, seeing what was going on, quietly led up the
Queen, and stood by her in focus; the rest of the Royal Family, as
our toast lists have it, closed in, forming a group near the Don; and
when the astonished operator removed the cap and exposed the plate
he found upon it the Royal Family of Denmark and one simple High-
land gentleman distinguished in such company by his plain estate.
In afternoon, Don CURRIE having entertained Kings and Queens
ard Crown Princes, threw open all the gangways of the ship to the
people of Copenhagen. They flocked in by hundreds, increasing to
thousands. In endless streams they passed along the decks peerin
and poking their noses into every nook and cranny. On upper dec
they had a great find. Sitting in his state cabin, with door open,
was Mr. G., reading
about the Vikings in
their own tongue,
which he has lately
added to his list of
acquired foreign lan-
guages. The Danes,
men, women, and
children, stood there
at gaze. Mr. G., with

through the after-
noon, ever changing,
but ever one in its
passionate, yet patient
desire to catch a
glimpse of that figure
in the cabin, that went
on reading, as if the
world outside were a
mere wilderness.
Wednesday.—At Kiel. Harbour and approaches filled with fleets
of all nations, every ship bristling with guns, and longing to be at
somebody. For the closing years of the nineteenth century of the
Christian Era, this is, as SARK says, most encouraging. . It is the
completest achievement, the proudest thing civilisation has to show us.
An admirable spot for a little quiet, reading,
although perhaps the firing does make it a leetle
difficult to concentrate one's thoughts wholly upon
the matter in hand.

THE German EMPERoR having expressed a wish to visit a non-
existing island at Hamburg, the tasteful citizens have constructed
one by means of wirework, canvas, plaster, and cement.
It is stated that the SULTAN is bored by the Bosphorus. The whole
surface of the water will therefore be covered with planks, painted
green, to represent meadows.
The KING of the BELGIANs is said to have remarked that Brussels
would be improved by a distant view of the sea. The municipal
authorities propose to cover the high, ground, seen from the palace
windows, with tin-foil. It is hoped that this will give the effect of
the sea gleaming in the sunshine.
The PRESIDENT of the French Republic having thought that it
would be a pleasing cympliment to Russia if some specimens of
Russian architecture could be erected in Paris, it is believed that the
Commission des Monuments Historiques will cover the Louvre with
laths and canvas, painted to represent the Kremlin, and by similar
means will transform the Champs Elysées into the Nevsky Prospect,
and will give to Notre Dame the appearance of the forts at Cronstadt.
The KHEDIVE has expressed an opinion that the Pyramids look old
and shabby. If the English and French government will authorise
the expenditure, the whole surface of the stone will be made perfectl
smooth, will be painted and grained in imitation of oak, and º
finall varnished. The face of the Sphinx will be washed, and will
then be used for an advertisement of an English soap. The enormous
rent paid for this will be added to the KHERIVE's pocket money.
The Queen of Holland is dissatisfied with the flat surroundings of
the Hague. It has been pointed out to HER MAJESTY that the city
contains a hill, called, we believe, the Yºº which rises at
least three feet above the level of the sea, but she has replied that
this is not enough. It is therefore proposed to surround the whole
city with a gigantic º of the Bernese Oberland.
The other day the King of SPAIN perceived a reflection of the moon
in a º and was much annoyed when his attendants failed to bring
it to him. It has now been arranged that all the ponds in the neigh-
bourhood shall contain an aluminium moon, which can be pulled out

FRIDAY, June 21. The Duke of CAMBRIDGE resigned his Com-
mander-in-Chieftaincy, and the Government was suddenly scattered
by a “Brodrick Patent Cordite Exploder,” which reduced the
Secretary of War's salary by a hundred pounds.
“A hundred pounds!

THE Witness Protection Society and General Legal Reform Union
has been holding its Annual General Meeting. Among the numerous
objects of this estimable body the chief appears to be to protect wit-
nesses in law courts from insult by counsel. Captain PARK15, having
expressed himself as willing, was voted to the chair, and the mem:
bers settled down to have a good time. “Heated discussion,”
“further disturbance,” and a well-sustained fire of “protests,” lent
an air of gaiety to the proceedings, which culminated in various
entlemen abusing one another across the table.” With such excel-
ent practice, the members of the W. P. S. G. L. R. U. should be
able to hold their own in court. The Bar trembles. Even the Bench
feels a little uneasy.

WHEN I was a freshman at Cambridge (eheu fugaces !) I remem-

a tutor of a certain College who was said to be the hero of a Baccha-
nalian incident. The º went that the tutor, returning from
some feast with a party of friends, fell, by mischance, into one of the
narrow streams of water that flow at the side of the Cambridge
streets: Striking out vigorously, he shouted, “Save the rest, I can
swim.” No doubt the story is still told, for the supposed hero of it
is still alive. Indeed, when a caricature of him was published some
years ago in Vanity. Fair, the º by JEHU JUNIoR closed
with the words, “He can swim.” et the story, as affecting
Mr. DASH, of Blank College, is manifestly false, for it is older than
the century. The curious may find it in its original form in the
lately published volume of S. T., CoLºRIDGE's letters. The poet
relates it of an undergraduate of his day who had taken partin a

or two later six gentlemen, who had been present when the incident
did not occur, related it back to me, each one with a little special
embellishment of his own. Some of them were magistrates, most of
them were fathers of families, and all were honourable men. Yet
they were all prepared to stake their reputations on the absolute
yeracity of this myth; and, what is even more curious, they retailed
it to its inventor and disseminator.
LYIHAM is troubled. I read that “the musical attractions at the
Pier Pavilion have been fairly patronised, and dancing on the pier is
to be resumed.” This latter attraction, it ap , has not met with
the entire approval of the Lytham le, who contend that it will
bring Lytham into disrepute, “The Ratepayers' Association have had
the matter under consideration, and have disclaimed any connection
with the innovation. The directors, however, have had the question
under discussion, and have decided to continue the dancing.”
SAID the pier-man to the tourist, “Lo, the tide is flowing free;
Won't you come and join the dangers in our Temple by the sea?
See how mazily the Harries and the Harriets advance,
Will you won't you, will you won't you, won't you join the dance?
'We have cornets, flutes and fiddles, and we always play in time,

I NoTE from a correspondence in The Scotsman that a considerable
amount of feeling has been aroused by the erection of the new North
British Railway Hotel in Princes Street. Lord WEMYss, apparently
has declared not only that it will spoil the view, but also that it will
“pierce the vault of heaven.” Another º: adds that it
will have “a Jennerised, unreposeful front.” at ought to settle
the matter at once. Someone else complains of “those terrible
advertisements of drugs and fluid beef which extend in º
letters along the side of the lower part of the Carlton Hill, and which
catch the ºf eye of anyone looking from the Bridges, from the

MR. C. J. WALTon, of Wolverhampton, writes to the Birmingham
Daily Gazette with reference to a recent appeal on behalf of the
victims of the “Liberator” frauds. “Ifailentirely to see,” he says,
“how a member of the Church of England can be expected to make
the slightest sacrifice (except on the principle of Christian charity)
seeing that the whole idea of the “Liberator’ scheme was to find
funds for the agitators whose sole aim was the robbery and destruc-
tion of the Church of England as a national institution, and to get
hold of its funds for secular and non-religious purposes.” Dear me,
dear me, how strange, how terrible, how muddle-headed. . This poor
politician has evidenti got mixed up between the Liberator and the
“Liberation Society.” "Let him take the hint, and send in his

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The Convict Ship, CLARK Russell's latest novel (CHATTo AND
WINDUs), is redolent of the sea. There is no writer, not forgetting
MARRYAT, who has such close companionship with the sea in its
multiple forms and its many moods. The temptation to transfer
- some of the ever-varying pictures of the
sea which sparkle in these pages, is great
but must be resisted. Here is a glimpse of
night at sea, chosen not because it is best,
but because it is shortest:-
º “The mighty shadow of the ocean night was
majestic and awful, with the wild, flashful
colouring of lighthing in the south, and the
dustlike multitude of stars over the three
glooming spires of our ship.”
One would suppose that, sitting down to
write, CLARK RusseIL had just come home
from a long trip foreign, or at least lived his
life somewhere within sight and sound of
the sea. The pity of it is, my Baronite
tells me, that this incomparable student of
the sea, of ships that go down upon the
waters, and of those who people them, lies
at anchor on his sofa in an inland town. He has not looked upon
the sea for a dozen years, nor smelt its brine, nor watched a ship
coming or going...This makes the more marvellous the power, of
.# of sea life in all its forms here *::::::: Beyond this
special gift, fascinating to some º Mr. Russell has a sto
to tell, a good stout sea story, full of life and adventure, throug
the devious movements of which we meet real men and one woman.
Remembering that CLARK Russell, now ranks as a veteran novelist
it is pleasant to bear testimony to the fact that he seems to have save
his best wine to the last. The Convict Ship is, take it from stem to
stern, the best work he has yet turned out. Tim B. D. B.W.
“N.B.”—Glasgow will have to look after its parks. Here is the
Town Council actually dreaming of “feuing” some of “the recently-

One protester says South Side Park is the prettiest in Glasgow, and
“more like the London parks, which I regard as the finest in the

through the railings in the Pollokshaws Road,” reminds him of
“the fine view of Hyde Park which is to be had through the railing
in that busy and lovely thoroughfare-Oxford, Street.”. Thanks

CHATS WITH THE CHILDREN.
A COMIC RAILWAY JOURNEY.
Miss Prunes-Prism. And now, my dear charges, I trust you have
utilised the hour that has been hypothecated to enjoyment profitably.
Emily. Indeed we have, dear governess. I have read to my
brother and sister a most amusing account of a railway traveller who
wished to get from Bangor to Euston in five hours, and was baffled
in the well-intentioned attempt by the clever ingenuity of the rail-
way companies!
Miss Prunes-Prism. You refer, no doubt, to the gentleman who,
having left Bangor at 755, reached Llandudno at 8.5, Colwyn Bay
at 8.41, Abergele at 8.52 Khvi at 9.2, and Chester at 9.56.
Margaret. Yes, dear Miss PRUNEs. PRISM; and it is at that point
the fun of the railway companies came in. Having arrived at 9.56
he found that the train for London had already left. It was timed
to depart for the metropolis exactly one minute before the arrival of
his train at 9 551
Emily. Indeed, dear governess, the story is vastly entertaining.
Then there is a similar arrangement at Crewe Junction. At that
centre of popularity a train arrives from a provincial source at 1048,
just one minute later than the advertised time for the departure of
the London train. Those who have the framing of these traffic
arrangements must be wags of the first water!
Miss Prunes-Prism. No doubt they are. And now, my dear
CHARLEs, supposing your dear papa wished to get from Bangor to
Euston, what would you advise him to do?
Charles. I should recommend him to walk.
Miss Prunes-Prism. I think, my dear child, that your counsel
would be sound. And now, my dear charges, having enjoyed our
chat, let us return with renewed energy to the consideration of the
principal incidents of Magna Charta.

THERE has been much excitement in Sheffield about the School
Board. The unsectarianP; had a chance of converting a minority
of one into a majority of the same extent.owing to the retirement
of one Church member, and the serious illness of another, Father
BURRE, who was thereby prevented from attending the Board
meeting for the election of a new member. Mr. CHARLEs Hobson,
however, refused to take advantage of an accident to reverse for the
next two years and a half the policy of the Board laid down by a
majority of the ratepayers, and chose what he considered the better
part of pairing with Father BURRE. Therefore was the chairman
enabled to give a casting yote in favour of the Church, candidate.
But “Hobson's Choice” has not pleased his candid friends, who
think, and say, that it is “not war,” nor even magnificent. The
blades must needs keep up the credit of their native place by making
cutting remarks. They come from Sheffield.

CHATS WITH THE CHILDREN.
A COMIC RAILWAY JOURNEY.
Miss Prunes-Prism. And now, my dear charges, I trust you have
utilised the hour that has been hypothecated to enjoyment profitably.
Emily. Indeed we have, dear governess. I have read to my
brother and sister a most amusing account of a railway traveller who
wished to get from Bangor to Euston in five hours, and was baffled
in the well-intentioned attempt by the clever ingenuity of the rail-
way companies!
Miss Prunes-Prism. You refer, no doubt, to the gentleman who,
having left Bangor at 755, reached Llandudno at 8.5, Colwyn Bay
at 8:41, Abergele at 8.52. Rhyl at 9.2, and Chester at 9.56.
Margaret. Yes, dear Miss PRUNES-PRISM; and it is at that point
the fun of the railway companies came in. Having arrived at 9.56
he found that the train for London had already left. It was timed
to depart for the metropolis exactly one minute before the arrival of
his train at 9 551
Emily. Indeed, dear governess, the story is vastly entertaining.
Then there is a similar arrangement at Crewe Junction. At that
centre of popularity a train arrives from a provincial source at 1048,
just one minute later than the advertised time for the departure of
the London train. Those who have the framing of these traffic
arrangements must be wags of the first water |
Miss Prunes-Prism. No doubt they are. And now, my dear
CHARLEs, supposing your dear Fº wished to get from Bangor to
Euston, what would you advise him to do?
Charles. I should recommend him to walk,
Miss Prunes-Prism. I think, my dear child, that your counsel
would be sound. And now, my dear charges, having enjoyed our
chat, let us return with renewed energy to the consideration of the
principal incidents of Magna Charta.
SERIEs To Succeed, “THE PENNY Poets.”—“The Tuppenny-
Ha'penny Poetasters.” To include the lays of the Logrollerites,
ENCORE WERSE.
(See Song, “The Two Graces,” in last week's “Purch")
º: the first innings of the Jubilee Match, “I Zingari versus Gentlemen
of England,” W. G. GRAce, Sen., scored 34, and W. G. GRAce, Jun., 79].
Sys the young W. G. to the old W.G., -
“Seventy-nine, my potent pater, Seventy-nine!”
Says the old W. G. to the young W. G.
“That beats mine, sonny WILLIAM, that beats mine!
A. G. STEEL does little cricket, but he made hay of my wicket;
How we used to run the score up, he and I, long ago!
But I told you you would do it, if you only dared stick to it;
And we know, we old 'uns, WILLIAM ; yes, we know!”
THERE has been much excitement in Sheffield about the School
Board. The unsectarianP; had a chance of converting a minority
of one into a majority of the same extent, owing to the retirement
of one Church member, and the serious illness of another, Father
BURRE, who, was thereby prevented from attending the Board
meeting for the election of a new member. Mr. CHARLEs Hobson,
however, refused to take advantage of an accident to reverse for the
next two years and a half the policy of the Board laid down by a
majority of the ratepayers, and chose what he considered the better
part of pairing with Father BURKE. Therefore was the chairman
enabled to give a casting vote in favour of the Church, candidate.
But “Hobson's Choice” has not pleased his candid friends, who
think, and say, that it is “not war,” nor even magnificent. The
blades must needs keep up the credit of their native place by making
cutting remarks. They come from Sheffield.
Who Threw It, P
Joy in the Church, confusion in the chapel,
And contradictory clamour everywhere!
It may be questioned if the Eris-apple




and the leading aspirants to the Laureateship.
Gendered more strife than "Mr. GLADSTONE's Pair.”

And we know, we old 'uns, WILLIAM ; yes, we know!”
THERE has been much excitement in Sheffield about the School
Board. The unsectarian Pº had a chance of converting a minority
of one into a majority of the same extent, owing to the retirement
of one Church member, and the serious illness of another, Father
BURRE, who was thereby prevented from attending the Board
meeting for the election of a new member. Mr. CHARLEs Hobson,
however, refused to take advantage of an accident to reverse for the
next two years and a half the policy of the Board laid down by a
majority of the ratepayers, and chose what he considered the better
part of pairing with Father BURRE. Therefore was the chairman
enabled to give a castin; vote in favour of the Church candidate.
But “Hobson’s Choice” has not pleased his candid friends, who
think, and say, that it is “not war,” nor even magnificent. The
blades must needs keep up the credit of their native place by making
cutting remarks. They come from Sheffield.
Who Threw. It P
Joy in the Church, confusion in the chapel,
And contradictory clamour everywhere!
It may be questioned if the Eris-apple

and the leading aspirants to the Laureateship.
Gendered more strife than “Mr. GLADSTONE's Pair.”

MR. F. J. HoRNIMAN, F.R.G.S.,

vitation to oppose Mr. CAVENDISH
BENTINCK, Conservative M.P., for
the united borough of Penryn,
Flushing, and Falmouth. It is
anticipated, says the Western
Daily Mercury, that he will
make a good candidate. Certainly
he ought to be able to suit the con-
stituencytoa T, unlessit continues
faithful to its CAVENDISH, in
which case his candidature will
end in smoke. Mr. HoRNIMAN,
do doubt, will welcome an early
general election, because the
longer he stands the greater pro-
spect of his getting what school-
boys call a “tannin'.”

CHATS WITH THE CHILDREN.
A COMIC RAILWAY JOURNEY.
Miss Prunes-Prism. And now, my dear charges, I trust you have
utilised the hour that has been hypothecated to enjoyment profitably.
Emily. Indeed we have, dear governess. I have read, to my
brother and sister a most amusing account of a railway traveller who
wished to get from Bangor to Euston in five hours, and was baffled
in the well-intentioned attempt by the clever ingenuity of the rail-
way companies!
Miss Prunes-Prism. You refer, no doubt, to the gentleman who,
having left Bangor at 755, reached Llandudno at 8.5, Colwyn Bay
at 8:41, Abergele at 8.52. Rhyl at 9.2, and Chester at 9.56.
Margaret. Yes, dear Miss PRUNES-PRISM; and it is at that point
the fun of the railway companies came in. Having arrived at 9.56
he found that the train for London had already left. It was timed
to depart for the metropolis exactly one minute before the arrival of
his train at 9 551
Emily. Indeed, dear governess, the story is vastly entertaining.
Then there is a similar arrangement at Crewe Junction. At that
centre of popularity a train arrives from a provincial source at 1048,
just one minute later than the advertised time for the departure of
the London train. Those who have the framing of these traffic
arrangements must be wags of the first water!
Miss Prunes-Prism. No doubt they are. And now, my dear
CHARLEs, supposing your dear º wished to get from Bangor to
Euston, what would you advise him to do?
Charles. I should recommend him to walk,
Miss Prunes-Prism. I think, my dear child, that your counsel
would be sound. And now, my dear charges, having enjoyed our
chat, let us return with renewed energy to the consideration of the
principal incidents of Magna Charta.
SERIES To SUCCEED “THE PENNY PoETs.”—“The Tu y-
Ha'penny Poetasters.” To include the lays of the Logrollerites,
ENCORE WERSE.

º: the first innings of the Jubilee Match, “I Zingari versus Gentlemen
of England,” W. G. GRAce, Sen., scored 34, and W. G. GRACE, Jun., 79].
Sys the young W. G. to the old W.G., -
“Seventy-nine, my potent pater, Seventy-nine!”
Says the old W. G. to the young ‘W. G. -
“That beats mine, sonny WILLIAM, that beats mine! -
A. G. Steel does little cricket, but he made hay of my wicket;
How we used to run the score up, he and I, long ago! .
But I told you you would do it, if you only dared stick to it;
And we know, we old 'uns, WILLIAM ; yes, we know!”
THERE has been much excitement in Sheffield about the School
Board. The unsectarian party had a chance of converting a minority
of one into a majority ºthe same extent, owing to the retirement
of one Church member, and the serious illness of another, Father
BURKE, who was thereby prevented from attending the Board
meeting for the election of a new member. Mr. CHARLEs Hobson,
however, refused to take advantage of an accident to reverse for the
next two years and a half the policy of the Board laid down by a
majority of the ratepayers, and chose what he considered the better
part of pairing with Father Burke. Therefore was the chairman
enabled to give a casting yote in favour of the Church, candidate.
But “Hobson's Choice” has not pleased his candid friends, who
think, and say, that it is “not war,” nor even magnificent. The
blades must needs keep up the credit of their native place by making
cutting remarks. They come from Sheffield.
