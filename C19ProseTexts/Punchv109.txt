A COLLOQUY IN CLOUDLAND.
SCENE–Cloudland, nigh to midnight of the last day of the Old Year. The Incomparable Sage of Fleet Street and “La
Mancha's Matchless Knight” mounted on their respective wooden horses.
Mr. Punch (spurring the Spotted One). Yoicks! Tallyho!! Hark forward | | | Something like space-consuming
speed this, eh, my dear Don? Who talks now of a Horseless Age 2
Don Quixote (turning the peg of Malambruno's magic steed). Only your scientific and sensational journals, who,
dryasdust dogs are, after all, endless leagues behind Merlin the Enchanter, and the magic-aided heroes of old romance.
Mr. Punch. Kim up, my timber-built timber-topper, and spotted space-devourer As though the much-talked of
motor-carriage, auto-cycle, or petroleum-propelled tram-car of these mouthing days of modernity might compare with the
Trifaldi's steed, my spotted Pegasus, or even the peripatetic carpet of Persian story: Speed you well, valorous knight ! .
Don Quixote. Heaven guide thee, undaunted Sage Hah! How you fly aloft How you cut the air more swiftly
than an arrow !! How you mount, and soar, and astonish the world below !!!
Mr. Punch. Haha Ours is no imaginary, bellows-blown flight, as was yours, worthy knight, when seated with
SANcho on the wooden crupper of Clavileno, pressed aforetime by the valourous PETER of Provence, and the fair MAGALoNA
Don Quixote. Nay, indeed, Sir Knight of the Spotted Bucephalus—for thou art no chivalry-scorning TRIFALDI-we
are not now blindfolded, and thy Pegasus, thy Brilladoro, thy Bayarte, thy Frontino, thy Clavileno el Aligero—or Wooden-
Peg the Winged—might give a lead even to my renowned Rosinante'
Mr. Punch. Blindfolded ? Nay, dear knight, I am the Dazzling Illuminator, not the Bewildering Blin ler!
Don Quixote. I plainly perceive that thou art a Progressive.
Mr. Punch. I am a Progressive Moderate and a Moderate Progressive. Badge me not therefore in any less compre-
hensive fashion, O Knight of the Rueful Countenance.
Don Quixote. I presume, Sir Sage, that those same Progressives, however, who claim to initiate all the forthright
movement of the Age, did originate and invent the motor-carriages, auto-cycles, and other the horseless locomotive vehicles
of which we spake but now?
Mr. Punch. Who better than yourself should know, my dear Don, that all are not Progressives who make a stir about
Progress” Like the circumgyrators in the game of “Giant's Stride,” many of them ramp round in a circle, and “get no
forrader.” I am the only true and trustworthy Progressive, and my auto-motor cuts all records !
Don Quixote. And is it propelled by petroleum ?
Mr. Punch. By nothing so crude, flaring, and fuliginous, dear Don. It is “motived" by—Light !

Don Quixote. Wondrous machine ! How would I like to mount it ! Is it in likeness of a horse ?
Mr. Punch. Say not the witlings and wiseacres that we are on the verge of a Horseless Age 2
Don Quixote. They do. But, by the bones of my beloved Rosinante, the idea liketh me not. The horse is indeed a
noble animal
Mr. Punch. And will continue to be “useful to man,” our current cyclo-and-auto-motormania notwithstanding. The
cycle doubtless hath its utility, and even charm, though in certain of its characteristics it seems qualified to give mankind the
hump!
p Don Quiacote. And womankind the wobbles!
Mr. Punch. When lovely woman stoops to wheeling,
And finds too late that bikes betray,
Beauty, and grace, and finer feeling
She 'll see the sex hath chucked away ! -
Don Quirote. Verily, had my peerless DULCINEA herself bestraddled a spinning-wheel in ungraceful posture and un-
seemly garb, I, her sworn knight, should have deemed her the victim of diabolic enchantment. Why, even the afflicted
duenna, with her fair cheeks beard-begrown by enchantment, she whom SANGHo called the Countess Three-Skirts, would not
—save under dire compulsion—have donned the modern divided skirt and mounted the man-saddled steed of steel. Art
sure, Sir Sage, that after all it is not enchantment that hath so far unsexed your afflicted damosels and duennas, and that
'tis not my duty in their defence to lay lance in rest
Mr. Punch. Nay, sweet soul of chivalry, Mayfair is not La Mancha, and you may safely leave its fair denizens to the
defence—or, if need be, chastening—of that knightly lance of to-day, my own invincible and unerring baton. But, verily,
'twere a punishment not ill-deserved by certain of our mannish maidens and male-mimicking matrons did MALAMBRUNo clap
bristly scrubbing-brush hairs upon them as upon your distressful Duenna of Toledo.
Don Quirote. Verily, Sir Sage, we are mounting skyward, dawn-ward, New Year-ward in a wondrous manner Thy
spotted steed is surely Pegasus itself, for Skyworld is full of myriad voices of wisdom and melody.
Mr. Punch. But my Auto-Motor, comparable only with the Sun God's glowing chariot, shall outsoar and outshine
even our present empyrean flight.
Voice (suddenly sounding behind them). Wuff! Wuff! Wuff!
Don Quixote (looking round). Saints preserve us! What is this new marvellous enchantment? Hath Sirius itself
broken loose?—doth the Dog Star follow our trail 2
Mr. Punch. What seest thou, Sir Knight?
Don Quixote (with awe). I behold, as it were, an aerial fire-wheeled car, shapen in the guise of a Titanic Tome,
coruscating comet-like in its career, whereon is mounted—yes, verily—a Dog—a Dog of Dogs! What, Sir PUNCH, may be
this portent?
Mr. Punch. Why, my dear Don Quixote—who seems scarcely the Quixote Quicksight of the nursery rhyme—what
should it be but ToBIAs himself with that promised specimen of my Auroral Autocar, or Mirific Motor-Carriage, self-impelled,
self-steered, self-lighted, self-heated, the most peerless outcome of the true Progressive spirit, the true acme of sure and
speedy Progress; in other words, dear Don, and at your entire service, my

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A PATH OF PEACE.
(The Baltic Canal, June 22, 1895.)
[“Peace reigns over the whole fleet,” &c.—“Daily News” Special.]
A work of Peace, whereto from near and far
Gather the iron-bosomed brood of war,
Like new Stymphalian birds, whose claws and wings
The warrior welcomes and the poet sings.
Oh, gentle Peace, how strange in our strange day.
Thy mailéd retinue, thine armed array !
Thºse flower-deck'd obelisks, that silken rope,
Bright illustrations of the Tales of Hope,
The royal speeches and the loyal cheers,
- Disguise misgivings as they silence fears.
But Denmark's memories, and the thoughts of France,
As through the stream that yacht's white bows advance,
Breaking that slender cord from bank to bank,
Might move reflections strange. Yet let us thank
Adventurous skill which gives our ships to-day
A shorter passage and a safer way!
Not war alone, but trade, will take the track
That shuns the wild and stormy Skager Rak;
And may Brunsbüttel's now familiar name
Be little linked with Empire's big War-Game
May battle-echoes in the Baltic cease,
And the Canal be a new Path for Peace
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
OUR B. A. (i.e., “Baron's Assistant”) begs to congratulate Mr.
GERALD CAMPBELL very heartily on the success of The Joneses and the
Asterisks (John LANE). It is no easy task to write a story in a series
of what may be called monological dialogues, dialogues, that is to
say, in which only one party speaks while the rest are understood, I
and yet to .# that lightness of touch and that sparkle of wit
without which dialogues become mere barren boredom. This is the
task that Mr. CAMPBELL has brilliantly accomplished. . The Joneses
and the Asterisks is as keen and telling a piece of social satire as it
has been the B. A.'s good fortune to come across for . 8. º day.
Thursday, June 27, *. The Baron opens ventilators, doors,
windows. Then, at haphazard, he takes up a book. Its title, What
is heat '... Answer immediately given *: thermometer, “95° in
the shade.” That's heat! And if that isn't, what is . The second
title of book is, A Peep into Nature's Most Hidden Secrets. But
the Baron is not Paul Pry; he doesn’t want to peep; at all events he
cannot undertake any exertion until about Nº. say, when he
will be delighted to peruse the work of Mr. FREDERICK Hoyºnº,
F.L.S., F.G.S., F.R.M.S., “Three single Fellows rolled into one.’
“Let me descend to the ice-cellar, or in cool grot let me sit,
with a soothing iced beverage and a choice Havannah; let me
read there About the North Pole, and Gunter's TalesW. Ices,”
quoth the BURDENED BARON DE BOOK-WoRMS.

Cor. O world, thy slippery turns ! Friends now fast sworn,
whose double bºoms seem to wear one heart, -
Whose hours, whose bed, whose meals, and exercise,
Are still together, who twin, as 'twere, in love
Unseparable, should, within this hour,
On the dissension of a doit, break out
To bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes,
Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep,
To take the one the other, by some chance -
Some trick, not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends,
And interjoin their issues. So with me:
My birth-place hate I, and my love's upon

To thee particularly, and all the WolçEs,
Great hurt and mischief... Now, this extremity,
Hath brought me to thy hearth.
Auf. O MARCIUs, MARCIUs!
Each word thou has spoken hath weeded from my heart
A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter -
Should from yond' cloud speak divine things,
And say, “’Tis true,” I’d not believe them more
Than thee, all noble MARCIUS.–Let me twine
Mine arms about that body, where against
My grained ash a hundred times hath broke.
. . . . I do contest
As hotly and as nobly with thy love
As ever in ambitious strength I did
Contend against thy valour. ... Why, thou Mars! I tell thee
We have a power on foot. . . 0, come, goin,
And take our friendly senators by the hands. . . .
Cor. You bless me, gods!
Auf. Therefore, most absolute Sir, if thou wilt have
The leading of thine own revenges, take .
The one half of my commission. But come in :
Let me commend thee first to those that shall
Say “Yea” to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!
And more a friend than e'er an §.
Yet, MARCIUs, that was much. Your hand! most welcome!

Question. Why do you desire to enter the House of Commons?
Answer. Because, if I am honoured by my fellow-men by being
chosen to represent them, it is my ambition to serve them faithfully
and maintain in all its glorious integrity the time-honoured heritage
of this mighty empire.
es, so you have said in your address to the electors; but have
you no other reason for wishing to occupy a seat in Parliament?
A.Certainly, ...The prestige bestowed by the letters “M.P.” is
pleasing, and if the honour ultimately culminates in a baronetcy or a
knighthocd the distinction will be gratifying to my wife.
. Q. Then you would not be adverse to receiving promotion in the
line to which you have referred?
4. No; because I should consider that I acted merely as a trustee
to my constituents—that I, in fact, appeared in the character of their
personal representative.
Yes, you said something of the sort the other evening at a
canvassing meeting in reply to a question put to you by one of your
voters; but surely the decoration would be desirable for some other
consideration?
. 4. It undoubtedly would have a certain market value in the City
in theW. of promoters of public companies of limited liability.
, Q. What measures have you taken to secure election beyond
issuing the very admirable address to which I have, more than once,
referred P
4.For the last two or three years I have assiduously nursed the
constituency.
Q: What do you mean by nursing a constituency?
.4. Obtaining a stake in the shape of land and a house in the
division, and making myself generally popular amongst my fellow-
*:
Q. How can you become popular *
4. By subscribing largely to local charities and institutions,
laying foundation stones, and opening fancy bazaars with untiring
*ºn,
Q. at considerations weigh, with you when you are invited to
add your name to a subscription-list?
4...I take care to make the sum I give a little larger than that
contributed by my opponent, and take it as a general rule that lawn
tennis is of more importance than dispensaries, and polo, from a
benevolent point of view, takes precedence of associations established
to relieve dire distress. -
Q. Is there any other method which may be adopted with advan-
tage by those desirous of nursing a constituency?
A. Speaking frequently in assembly rooms, taking nursery
gardens for the same purpose, and generally improving trade in the
neighbourhood. -
Q. Then the º; paid for the hirings to which you refer is
commercially º: -
A. It is, and joined of course to the eloquence of my friends and
myself) should distinctly influence the election.
t % And should you be elected, what do you suppose you will have
O 010 -
A. To thoroughly enjoy the honour of being able to treat the House
of Commons as a club, and being asked by the leaders of my Party
to all their entertainments. I shall see my name in every newspaper
report when I have happened to take part in a popular ction. I
shall find that I have mounted the social ladder by leaps and bounds,
and be able to pleasurably patronise or cut direct those who now
become my inferiors. - -
Q. And what consideration will support you in your general
demeanour?
A. The conviction that all I do, and have done, is and has been
actuated by the purest patriotism.
“DALY NEWS 1 SPECIAL ] o
Oxcr again we welcome the return of Miss ADA REHAN, with
JAMEs Lewis the Lively, and Mrs. GILBERT the Good, to DALY's, in
Leicester Square. But so short is their season, and so many are the
pieces announced, that to take more than a snap-shot at any one of
them is impracticable, seeing that the Daly º are weekly. Ere
anyone sees these lines AUGUSTIN DALY's train of thought will have
passed over, and beyond them. The Railroad of Love will have
served its p se, and become a siding. Two Gentlemen of Perona
will be travelling first-class on Shakspearian main line leading to
Midsummer Night's Dream, which, with its fairy revels and its
music, will represent the terminus of this short journey. When
will DALY & Co. come to stay?

Mr. Fricell, Fancy that's the bride in red cotton, with her hair

annoyance to the majority of hº resident in the locality.” If
“the nuisance” is permitted, the correspondent suggests the Park
will soon be deserted. When this happens, the cyclist can appropri-

THE BOY AND THE BAT.
[“Who may describe a small boy's passion for his bat?”—Daily News.]
Jemmy Bilkins, aged Thirteen-and-a-half, loquitur : —
I've won it, BILL, I’ve won it! And it’s pooty nigh full size!
Leastways, anyhow, it looks it., O.. I tell yer, it’s a prize.
Yaller- backed, BILL, and cane-’andled, and its got a sort o' feel,
As yer swing it wot reminds yer of a StopDART or a STEEL.
Last Saturday as ever wos I turned out afore six,
And practised in our back yard, wiv three lumps o' deal for “sticks.”
Young Polly she bowled to me, and I drove 'er, and I cut,
And “swiped over the Pervilion”—which I mean our water-lutt.
Poll can do a fair round-armer for a girl and no mistake,
And she’ll 'ave you, middle-stumpo, if yer don't look wide awake.
Twº the day of our School Match, BILL, and our gaffer, Mister
LORE,
'Ad promised a cane-’andler to the boy as made top score.
Oh I tellyer I meant 'aving it, if practisin' would do,
But my bat 'ad split a lum off, and it seemed to 'it askew.
'Ow can yer “keepa straight bat” when your bat itself aint straight?
But we did our level best, BILL, me an' Polly.

Qut at Petersham I tell you as we done the thing to rights,
None o'yer'at:an'-coat piles for the wickets, as is sights
A cricketer cocks snooks at, when 'e knows the real game.
No penny injy-rubber and a club #º all the same,
Wiv a second-'and stripped tennis-ball, a little on the lop,
reven a ha'penny woodeny, an' the chump end of a mop,
And my jacket on a stick for stump, I’ve 'ad a lot of fun,
And wiv such on Gosling Green, BILL, I fust larned to 'it an' run.
But to-day we did it different. Real stumps was pitched O. K.;
We’d a scoring-sheet, and umpire.'. We’d a red new ball to play,
As it seemed a sin to slog at, 'cos it took the §§ out;
But I tell yer we forgot that wiv the fust good 'it and shout.
Lanky STEye'e made that 'it,’e did. It scooted past long slip,
At forty mile a hour or so. That STEVE can make 'em skip.
He ºf me § a led, too, and I feared he'd cop the bun.
Yus, I thought the bat was hisºn when he'd piled º twenty-one !
I wanted fanning, BILLY, when I ups and takes my block,
And the ball came thunderin' at me like a little earthquake shock.
Seemed heverywhere, yet nowhere, if you understand me, BILLY.
And pitched just in that orkud spot as always knceks yer silly.
Coming off the pitch like pickles, as though aiming at yer heye;
But I pulls myself together for a yolley, an’ let fly.
And fust thing I knowed I heard it busting 'ard agin the fence;
And I felt I'd scored a boundary, and the cheering wos emense.
Then BILLY I lammed into 'em! They came as easy then
As little Polly's easiest lobs. BILLY, they called hus “Men!”
“The next man in wos BILKINs” the reporter sex—that's me!–
“An'e's a young phernomenon, a infant W.G.

And Polly—in the Press-tent!—wos the 'appiest girl alive

If “the Doctor” feels much 'appier when his Testimonial comes–
Well, though 'e's the pet of England, me a urchin from the slums,

To send the Telygraft, BILL. I should soon be on the job.

AFTER THE CONGRESS WAS OVER.
(A Strange Fragment dealing with a Mystery.)
Eyeby important question that could be
considered had been thoroughly examined
and decided. The delegates, who had come
from North, South, East ard West, had ex-
pressed their satisfaction with everything
they had seen in London. As for the British
Empire generally, their admiration knew no
bounds. “It was magnificent.” “It was
beautiful.” “It was grand.” And yet when
they prepared to take their departure there
was a shade of disappointment upon their ex-
pressive countenances. - -
... I wish Icould haveunderstoodit,” said one.
“It would have been a triumph of ingenuity
to have comprehended it,” observed another.
“The queries of the Egyptian Sphinx were
the easiest of conundrums, in comparison,”
added a third.
And others chimed in to the same effect.
But to the very last the delegates tried their
best to solve the problem. ...At length the
company departed. The hall in which the
great assembly had been held was empty.
There was one striking object in the deserted
apartment. It was a book—a yellow-covered
book. Evidently, it had been much read.
But, in spite of the #ºf there was no
distinct evidence that the full meaning of its
contents had been grasped by anyone.
In the §§ of the night the moonbeams
illuminated the title-page. ... .
The volume that rested so securely with its
knowledge carefully concealed between its
º; covers was Bradshaw's Railway
t!!de.
WHO WouldN'T BE AN ALDERMAN ?–I have
often wished to be an Alderman, and, after
reading the following extract from the Bir-
mingham Daily Gazette, I have fixed upon
West Bromwich as the scene of my aldermanic
labours. It must be glorious to joke with
such ease:–
“A WEST BROMwich ALDERMAN's Joke.—
Yesterday morning when the West Bromwich
guardians entered the Board Room at the West
Bromwich Workhouse, the blinds were all drawn,
and as a consequence the room presented a very
gloomy appearance. The business was about to
be commenced, when Alderman R. WILLIAMs
objected to the blinds being lowered. He in-
quired whether their lowering had a political sig-
nificance, and whether the house was in mourning
for the death of the Radical government, if hi.
assumption was true he censidered they should
not commence the business until the blinds were
raised. (Laughter.) Two of the largest blinds
were then raised, but six others were allowed to
remain down.”

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
SoME of us like our English short, others prefer it expanded.
Some of us, for instance, might say that “NERo fiddled while Rome
burnt.” But this bald statement is obviously quite unsuited to the
decorative instincts of the age, for in the Daily Telegraph, only last
week, I read that “a notorious Roman Emperor is credited with the
performance of a violin solo during the raging of a serious conflagra-
tion in the heart of his capital.” The omission of NERO's name
gives to this sentence a delicate parliamentary flavour, which brings
it absolutely up to date.
BUT what a noble example it is! Henceforward, for instance, if it
should ever fall to my lot to write about HENRY THE EIGHTH of
England, I shall feel a mere fool if I state that he married seven
wives. No, no. A British monarch, celebrated in the books of the
historians as the Eighth, and hitherto the last of his name, is re-

would equal the sum total of predecessors bearing his name who
have supported the burden of the crown of these realms. For a very
slight increase of salary I am prepared to double the length of this
sentence without adding a single fact to it.
HERE, too, is a delightful extract from a gorgeously illustrated
volume issued by a firm of house-agents in praise of what they very

pride,
Next let us contemplate a pure gem of descriptive English from a
sporting contemporary. It occursin an account of the athletic contest
between Cambridge University and the United Hospitals:—
Scarcely a cloud flecked the blue heaven yesterday afternoon, and a
dazzling sky burnished the Stamford Bridge grounds into an acre of reflected
sunshine. What a pleasant ºpo the tryst of the premier athletic club on
which to hold athletic revels: It was not to be expected that the people
would show a front at the carnival. So much to do nowadays, what with
cycling at Hurlingham, and the Beauty wheel show on the Row in Battersea
Park. Equal to the occasion though proved many English girls, and it was
pleasing indeed to note their presence in the pavilion and enclosures. Bold
as Britannia as a rule in this, the nineteenth century. And don't forget this,
innocent as a posy all the while. ... Think of this now. W. MENDLE-
son (C.U.A.C.), but by birth a New Zealander, figuratively speaking, gazed
on the ruins (long jump ruins, of course) of Britishers at Stamford Bridge.
It was with a quickened pulse that one watched the Hurdle Race. 'Pon our
soul 'twas a #. problem to solve a few steps from home to tell which
would win, PILKINgtoN or Lowe. The flag went up for the visitor from the
banks of the Cam. Nevertheless, no one can assert but that the medical
banner remained hoisted at the truck in honour of their representatives.
Gallant seconds!... Of course H. A. MUNRo gave us a taste of his quality
in the Three Miles. Verily he ran as though able to keep up pacing from
sunrise to sunset. 'Twas a glorious victory that he gained. Neither must
the plucky bid made by HoRAN be forgotten. Ah! if he had only been
MUNRo! But he wasn't, so there was no use in thinking about that.
How melancholy are these might-have-beens. If NApoleon had
only been WELLINGTON. But he wasn't. So there was no use in
thinking about that.
HENLEY Regatta, I understand, is to be an international festival
this year., A Dutch crew has entered for the Thames Cup, but it is
not stated that they carry a broom in their bows. Nor is it to be
inferred that they will make a clean sweep of the prize. Besides
many English crews they will meet a crew from France. Then from
Toronto come four Argonauts sailing not for the Golden Fleece, but
for the Stewards' Challenge Cup; and from Ithaca, N.Y., eight
modern Trojans, º of Cornell º have set out
intent on the capture of the Grand Challenge Cup. To all of them
Mr. Punch, extends the right hand of good fellowship, though,
being British to the backbone, he cannot wish for their triumph over
his own gallant oarsmen. And amongst these he especially welcomes
Mr. C. W. KENT, the Hero of Leander, who, having four times
stroked his crew to victory, is once more seated on the slide of honour
to defendpossession of the Grand,-KENT, the pride of joyous Moulsey,
whom at his birth the Fates endowed with the triple gifts of cunning,
resource and courage, bidding him wield an indomitable oar in un-
defeated crews. As when a fox, emer º from the tangled covert—
But I cannot pursue the Virgilian .# any further. Let the event
next week speak for itself. Here’s luck all round, and may the
best crew be an English one. In any case, may the best crew win.
THE gentlemen from Cornell have brought over with them, in
addition to their boats and oars, a terrible battle-cry, “Cornell, yell,
yell, I yell Cornell.” Manifestly the members of the London Rowing
Club cannot model themselves on this, for to cry, “London, done,
done. I’m done, London” would, I trust, be as inappropriate as it
would certainly be discouraging.
My recent investigations into the condition of some of our great
provincial cities i.f me to the depressing belief that something is
always wrong...with some of their streets. Here, for instance, is
“NEMo” writing to the Manchester Guardian to complain that
“on Saturday evening the Bury New Road was filthy, whilst the
odour was equal to that of the Ship Canal, but different. Formerly
there º to be an effort made to have the road brushed up on
Friday ready for Saturday and Sunday, when thousands of well-
dressed and happy le—Jew and Gentile—promenade it on their
way to breezy Kersal Moor.” But why, may I ask, should there be
no well-dressed and happy Christians prºmºnading on their way to
Kersal Moor? It may be that they have followed “our local repre-
sentatives,” who, “NEM2” suggests, “are enjoying their holidays,
or are immersed in golf,” which I take to be a delicate euphemism
for bunkered.

for “notices of British earthquakes, either
past or future... of any kind and from any

are made in private diaries.” All local papers
should at once start a special earthquake
column—“Earthquakes Day by Day,” or
“Yesterday's Earthquakes”–and writers of
diaries would do well to dive into the past.
There are so many remarkable phenomena not
otherwise recorded. Here is one. “Dined

the other day to Edinburgh, and drove in four-
-in-hands to the “beechy grove” at Melville
Castle, the Esk and DRUMMond's Hawthorn-
den, and then on to the castle and chapel at
Roslin. Lunch at Dalkeith, dinner at the
Balmoral Hotel at Edinburgh, and back re-
joicing at eventide to Glasgy, “after the
appiest and most successful excursion in
the history of the club.” This is the way to
keep up the dignity of literature. Far better

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY M.P.
House ºf Commons, Monday, June 24.—Back to-day from the
booming Baltic to wan Westminster. Given up the company of Kings
Jesse, the Pilot-Engine, clears the Line !
and Queens which formed Don CURRIE’s daily fare; de-cended to level
of Commons. And what a state of things to come back to Lºft
less than a fortnight ago, with House in almost comatose
state. Even the Busy B's had ceased to hum. TANNER no
longer disturbed at hour of midnight by poignant curiosity
as to when the Dook would retire. SILoMio, his head ban-
daged after latest buffeting by Edward GREY and SYDNEY
Buxton, temporarily silent. ALPHEUs CLEOPHAs for awhile
content with management of House by “my right hon.
friend the CHANCELLOR of ExchEQUER.” In a moment
in the twinkling of St. JoHN BRODRICK's eye, crisis and
chaos come. Ministry blown up with charge of cordite,
surreptitiously brought in; concealed under Front Oppo.i-
tion Bench; fired in the dinner hour. -
“Cordite?” said ToMLINson. , “What is this cordite
they’re all talking about? Thought it was something they
made trousers of.” - -
“No, no,” said Private HANBURY, up in all military
matters. “You’re thinking of corduroy.” . -
House crowded from furthest bench of side galleries to
fº steps on floor. A buzz of excitement completes
ulness of chamber. Only two empty seats. These on front
benches, where SQUIRE of MALwood and PRINCE ARTHUR
were wont to face each other. Joseph's seat below gangway
filled by CourTNEY, who, in honour of occasion, has put on a
white waistcoat and a smile. Wears both throughout pro-
ceedings. Aloud cheer welcomes arrival of PRINCEARTHUR
looking graver than usual. Three minutes later another rings
forth, and the SQUIRE of MALwood enters with slow step and
countenance set, suitable to the obsequies of an assassinated
Ministry. JEsse Collings comes in; startled by cheer from
Irish Members. -
“JoE’s not far off,” said TIM HEALY, grimly. “In times
like these sends JEsse on ahead, like the pilot-engine that
goes before CzAR's train. If there were . murderous plot
on hand, by JustiN McCARTHY, or any other brigand, the
blameless figure of Jesse would be blown into space, and
Joseph would proceed on his journey with his hair unsinged.”
On stroke of half-past three SQUIRE of MALwood made
formal announcement of familiar fact that Government had
resigned; THE MARKIss had been sent for; Ministers kept
their places only till their successors were appointed.
“I would ask leave to say,” the SQUIRE, with unwonted
tremor in his voice, observed, bringing to close his brief,

the noble conflict of Parliamentary life, the chiefest of all am-
bitions, whether in a majority or in a minority, must be to stand
well with the House of Commons.”
How in this respect the Leader of the House through two Sessions
of peculiar difficulty stands with both sides, testified to by a
ringing cheer, repeated when PRINCE ARTHUR, who always does
these things well, voiced the common feeling as he recognised in the
blushing SQUIRE “one of the greatest ornaments of this House.”
“That's all very well, Toby,” said the SQUIRE, when I offered him
§ congratulations on deliverance from a situation long become in-
tolerable. “You . it prettily. But I hope the experience of the
last fortnight will be a lesson to you. You hadn't been gone a week
and two days when the cordite bomb was exploded.

their faces towards the door, ToMMY, buttonholing Time as it were

Tuesday.—House met again, expecting further particulars about

Wednesday.—All settled: SquTRE announces that MARKISs has

vacancies consequent on acceptance of office. Amongst them West
Birmingham, Joseph having undertaken to care for the Colonies.

GoRST writes:—“A lady resident in East London informed me that
she once knew a man who was attending fourteen doctors at the same

SARK wants to know what was the matter with the doctors? Why
the man was attending them P And whether this is cited as case of
overwork, or of death resulting from infectious disease ?
The worst of SARK is that his curiosity is almost feminine in its
intensity.

DURING the practice of the crews for Henley Regatta there has
been one exalted contest, which I cannot remember hearing of in
former years. My Sporting Life (of which I am a diligent and a
constant reader) informed me that “at one time it did seem as
though Jupiter Pluvius was about to swamp Old Boreas, but the
latter proved too º Quite a sporting event, evidently, Why,
oh why, was not Old Boreas present when Pelion was piled upon
Ossa? The whole course of (pre) history might have been changed.
A NEwcASTLE contemporary has been discussing the art of ...;

the following extract to the notice of the ladies of England?
“No woman is capable of being beautiful who is capable of being false.
The true art of assisting º consists in embellishing the whole person by
the ornaments of virtuous and commendable qualities. How much nobler
is the contemplation of beauty when it is heightened by virtue! How faint
and spiritless are the charms of a coquette, when compared with the loveli-
ness of innocence, piety, good-humour, and truth—virtues which add a new
softness to their sex, and even beautify their beauty That agreeableness
possessed by the modest virgin is now preserved in the tender mother, the
prudent friend, and the faithful wife. Colours artfully spread upon canvas
may entertain the eye, but not touch the heart; and she who takes no care
to add to the natural graces of her person, noble qualities, may amuse as
a picture, but not triumph as a beauty.”
CHELTENHAM is a pleasant place. I quote from a memory which
is, I know, miserably defective:
Year by year do England's daughters
In the fairest gloves and shawls
Troop to drink the Cheltenham waters,
And adorn the Cheltenham balls.
This is not the place that one would naturally associate with
violent language over so small a matter as the rejection of some
plans. A quarrel, however, has taken place in the Town Council,
and terrible words have been spoken:—
“In the course of a discussion on the rejection of some plans, Mr. MAR-
GRETT accused the acting chairman of the Streets 8.i. (Mr.
PARSoNAGE) with being influenced by personal and political motives against
the person (Mr. BARNFIELD) who sent them in. Mr. PARsoxAGE warmly
retorted with the lie direct, and told Mr. MARGRETT that he knew he was
lying. Mr. LENTHALL accused Mr. PARson AGE of being “slip-shod’ in
his method of bringing up the minutes of the Streets Committee, because
he had passed over without comment a dispute between the Corporation and
the Board of Guardians. While denying this imputation, Mr. PARson Age
said he would even prefer to be “slip-shod' than to follow Mr. LENTHALL's
example of giving utterance to a long-winded and frothy oration over such a
trumpery matter as a road fence.”
After this I quite expected to read that some one—
. . . raised a point of order, when
A chunk of old red sandstone took him in the abdomen,
And he smiled a sort of sickly smile and curled upon the floor!
And the subsequent proceedings interested him no more.

but they could make a new clock for £100. The letter was marked

HER PREVIOUS SWEET-
HEART,
Wednesday.—WIoIET has ac-
cepted me, this very day, the hap-
piest of my life. She is the
sweetest and prettiest woman in
the world. I have loved her long
and passionately. She has not
loved melong, and she could never
love me passionately. She is rather
unemotional. Even when I kissed
her this afternoon for the first
time she was quite calm. She tells
me she has once loved, as though
she could never love again. Her

am a mere writer. His name
was PERCY PLANTAGENET CHOL-
Mondel.E.Y. Mineis Jones. I hope
that in time she may forget him.
Thursday.—Meet, her in the
Row, and sit under the trees. She
is fond of horses. So am I, but I
do not ride often. She mentions
that Captain CHOLMondel EY was
a splendid rider. Listen patiently
to what she tells me.
Friday.--To the Opera with
VIoIET and her people. She does
not care for Gounod's Faust.
Prefers a burlesque with comic
songs. Says, the Captain sang
comic songs admirably, with banjo
accompaniment. When it’s well
done, I also like that. Tell her so.
his encourages her to further
reminiscences. Of course, she is
right to conceal nothing from me

may be carried too far. Manage
to change the subject at last, and
then unfortunately the Soldier's
Chorus reminds her of a parody in
an amateur burlesque which Cap-
tain Cholmon DELEY—and so on.
Saturday.—Meet her at Hurl-
ingham. She is so fond of polo.
She says the Captain was a splen-
did player. I expected that. A
sort of Champion of the World.
Of course. I never played in my
life. Listen to an account of his

exploits. Rather bored.
Sunday.—Up the river. Very hot day. Delightful to lounge in
the shade and smoke, VIOLET more energetic...Qompels me to exert
myself. She says the Captain could do anything in a boat. No
doubt. I am prepared to hear that he shot the Falls of Niagara in a
punt. He was a wonderful genius. I am tired of hearing of him.
Monday.—To Mr. Montgomery-MUMBr's dance. WIolet there
of course. We both like dancing. Get on charmingly together.
Suddenly something reminds her of the ever-lamented Captain
... P. C. I suggest that he has said good-bye to her for ever, as his
initials show; She does not see the little joke. Have to explain it to
her. Then she says it is a yery poor joke. No doubt it is, but she
needn't tell me so. Annoying. A certain coolness between us.
Tuesday.—To the French ſºlº with WIoI.ET and her aunt. She
understands French very well. Seems to think a lot of me because
I know something of several languages. Ask her if Captain CHOL-
MonTELEY was fond of learning languages. Am prepared to hear
that he was a second MEzzoFANTI. On the contrary, it seems that
he couldn't speak a word of anything but English, and that he
didn't speak very much that was worth hearing even in that... The
only French he could understand was in a menu. Apparently he
never read anything else in any language, except the sporting papers
in English. Have at last found something he could not do. De-
lighted. Unfortunately show this. WIOLET begins to defend him.
I say he must have been rather a duffer. She retorts that I can't
play polo. What has that to do with it? . Again a coolness between us.
Wednesday.—It is all over ! We have parted for ever. She
could never forget that confounded Captain. Asked her this morn-
ing, when she was telling me of his shooting elephants, or alligators,
or rabbits, or sparrows, or something wonderful, why she did not
marry him. She says it was broken off. She shows me his last
letter of farewell, I read it critically. It is very short. Point out
to her nine mistakes in spelling, and four in grammar. She says I
am brutal. Indignation. Argument. Scorn. Tears. Farewell.

ELECTION INTELLIGENCE.
Brybury-on-the-Pocket.—Both candidates very }.} Meetings
are being held all day long at the principal hotels, and any number
of livery-stable-keepers have promised to lend their carriages on the
day of election: The agents on either side have an enormous staff of
assistants, and trade was never known to be brisker during the
present century.
Crowncrushington.--This will be a very near contest. As political
feeling runs rather high, a number of extra beds have been prepared
in the hospitals. The police have been reinforced, and the military
are close at hand, and every other, preparation has been made to
secure the declaration of the poll with as little friction as possible.
Meddle-cum-Muddleborough, -At present there are seven candi-
dates, but as three of these have issued their manifestoes under some
misapprehension it is not unlikely that the number will be reduced
before the day of nomination. It is not easy to foretell the result, as
since the establishment of the ballot every election has ended not
ong in surprise but stupefaction.
Selfseekington.—It is not unlikely that there will be no contest in
this important borough. The ſº. recently) sitting member has
fixed the º that would na y have fallen to the function of the
returning officer for the laying of the foundation stones of his Baths,
Wash-houses, Free Library and Town Hall, and the opening of his
Public Park.
Wrottenborough.--The popular candidate has pledged himself to
supporting, Local Veto, the Licensed Wictuallers, Establishment,
Disestablishment, Home Rule, the Integrity of the Empire, Anti-
Vaccination, the Freedom of the Medical Profession, and many
other matters of conflicting importance. The polling will be of a per-
functory character, as expenses are being cut down on both sides.

sion. At present there is no intelligence of any sort to chronicle.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
SMITH, ELDER & Co. are carrying out a
happy thought in projecting what they call
the Novel Series, a title which is the least
felicitous part of the business. It is designed
to meet the views of those who desire to pos-
sess, not to borrow (or indeed to steal) good
books. The volumes will not be too large to
be carried in the tº. nor too small to lie on
the shelf. Neatly bound, admirably printed,
§ are to cost from two shillings up to four
shillings, presumably according tolength and
the inclusion of illustrations. The series leads
off with The Story of Bessie Costrell, by Mrs.
HUMPHRY WARD. The story, if not precisely
pleasant, is decidedly powerful. Once taken
up, there is uncontrollable disposition to read
on to the end, a yearning the size of the volume
makes it possible conveniently to satisfy. The
new series starts with a promise announce-
ments of succeeding contributions seem likely
to fulfil. THE BARON DE Book-WoRMs.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
SCRAPS FROM CHAPS.
A REAL UNCRowNED KING.-At a
meeting of the Town Commissioners
of Kinsale, a report of the proceed-
ings discloses a conversation of a
truly remarkable kind—
“The Chairman thought that if they
paid Mr. PUNCH his quarter's salary up to
the 1st February they would be 3. g
very fairly with him, especially as they had
"Pºº his son as his successor. . . .
Messrs. KIELY and P. S. O'Connor con-
tended that as Mr. PUNCH was never dis-
missed by them, and the non-performance
of his duties was through no fault of his
own, he was entitled to some remunera-
tion.”
We should think he was, indeed!
Some remuneration, quotha P Does
not the mere fact that he bears a
name honoured and revered in every
corner of the globe entitle him to a
F." on the very highest scale
own to, the L. G. B. F. Not, we
need hardly say, an “old age” pen-
sion. Perpet youth is the pre-
rogative of all Punches. And they
“have appointed his son as his
successor.” Well, of course! How
can a PUNCH do anything but suc-
ceed P. He would be a rum PUNCH
if he didn't l Greetings to our distant
kinsman of Kinsale!
On E MAN, ONE TopPER!—In the
Glasgow Herald somebody writes as
follows:–
“It is surely time Mr. DuNcAN saw to
his bus-drivers' hats! Such a miscel-
laneous collection of seedy hats, I think,
could not be found elsewhere; they are a
positive disgrace to the city.”
The writer ought to have signed
himself “MACBETH: ” the “un-
uarded Duncan,” whoever he may
, must be on his guard, or pas-
sengers will strike for better hate.

All bus-drivers and conductors should
wear silk hats, to typify the habitual
softness of their address. Why not
put them into livery at once P. The

bably attract no end of custom. No
revolution like it, since the abolition
of the box-seatſ Uniform charges
and uniformed conductors should be
the future rule of the road.
“Not KILT. BUT SPACHELEss.”—
At Clonakilty Sessions the other day,
the following evidence was given:—
“PATRICK FEEN was examined, and
stated he resided at Dunnycove, parish
of Ardfield. . . . Gave defendant's brother
a blow of his open hand and , knocked
him down for fun, and out of friendship.
(Laughter.)”
What a good-natured, open-
handed friend Mr. PATRICK FEEN
must bel JoBN HEGARTY, the
person assaulted, corroborated the
account, and added,—
“When he was knocked down, he
stopped there. (Laughter.)”

BRIGGS, OF BALLIOL.
PART I.
BRIggs was the gayest dog in Balliol. If there was a bonfire in
the quad, and if the dons found their favourite chairs smouldering
in the ashes, BRIgGs was at the bottom of it. If the bulldogs were
led a five-mile chase at one o'clock in the morning, the gownless
figure that lured them on was BRIGGs. If the supper at WINNIE's
became so, uproarious that the Proctor thought it necessary to
interfere, the gentleman that dropped him from the first-floor window
was BRIggs. Anyone else would have been sent down over and over
again, but–BRIggs stroked the Balliol boat: BRIggs had his cricket
blue; BRIggs was a dead certainty against Cambridge, for the
quarter and the hundred: in short, BRiggs was indispensable to the
College and the 'Varsity, and therefore he was allowed to stay.
But what is this?...A change has come over BRIggs. He is another
man. Can it be-? Impossible—and yet? Yes, it began that very
night. Everyone has heard of Miss O'GREss, the Pioneer. She
came up to Oxford to lecture; her subject was “Man: his Position
and Raison d'être.”...BRiggs and I went to hear; went in light
laughing mood with little fear of any consequences. ‘We listened to
the Q'GRESS... “There is no doubt,” she said, “that Man was
intended by Nature to be the Father. For this high calling he
should endeavour to fit himself by every means in his power. He
should cultivate his body so as to render himself attractive to
Woman. He should be tall,”—her eye fellon BRIggs—“he should
handsome,”—still on BBIggs—“he should be graceful, he should
be athletic.”—At this point her eye seemed fairly to feast on Briggs
and a curious lurid light lowered in it. She paused a moment. f
was sitting next to BRIggs, and I felt a shiyer run through him.
lºoked at his face, and it was ghastly pale. I asked him in a whisper
if he felt faint? He impatiently motioned me to be silent, and
remained, as I thought, like a bird paralysed beneath the gaze of a
serpent; , I heard no more, so anxious was I on my friend's account;
nor could I breathe with any freedom until the audience rose and wé
were once again in the fresh air.
f|position was *;
E
The following day there was a garden-party at Trinity. BRIggs
said he was playing for the 'Varsity against Lancashire, and there-
fore could not go. Imagine my surprise then, when, as I was dºing
the polite among the strawberries and cream, I cau ht sight of him
slinking down the lime grove at the heels of the O'GREss. I rubbed
my eyes and looked again...Yes, it was BRIggs indeed. The face
was his; the features were his; the figure was his ; the clothes were
his—but, the buoyant step? the merry laugh? where, where, ch!
where were they?
- - -
-
The Long Wac. passed, and we were all up *ś for Michaelmas
Term. There was a blank in our circle. “Where's BRIGGs.””
asked BRowN. “Where's BRIggs?” asked TROTTER of Trinity.
We looked at one another. What!, Nobody seen RBIggs? Not up
yet?—Better go and see. We went to his rooms. No BRIGGs there,
and not a sign of his coming. We went to Jon ES. Jon Es knew no
more than we, to SMITH, GREEN, RoRERTs—all ſqually ignorant.
At last we tried the Porter. What! hadn't we heard the news?
News? No! What news? The Porter's face grew long. Why
Mr. BRIggs, 'e weren't comin' up no more. , Not coming up?
Not coming up? Nonsensel Impossible!-Fact, gentlemen, fact.
The Master, "e'd 'ad a note from Mr., BRiggs, sayin' as 'ow 'e
wouldn't be back agin. No one knew nothink more than that. No
one could explain it. -
There was despair in Balliol. What would become of us?...With-
out BRIggs we could never catch B. N. C. Magdalen would bump
us to a certainty, and we could hardly hope to escape the House. In
football it would be just as bad. ... Keble and Exeter would simply
jump on us, and not a single Balliol man would have his blue. The
ruin stared us in the face; the College was
in consternation, for BRIGGs had disappeared.
NOTE: BY A NATIONALIST.
“Home Rule all Round !” That cry is in the air:
What Ireland wants, though, is Home Rule all square.

And dissipate a distant gloom.

MR. BRIEFLESS, JUN., ON THE LONG
WACATION.
UNFORTUNATELY I was prevented, by an
appointment of a semi-professional character
—I had been desired by a maiden aunt to give
her my advice upon a question of damage
arising out of a canine assault committed
3. her lap-dog—from being present at the
eneral Meeting of the Bar, and conse-
#. was unable to take part in the annual
eliberations of my learned and friendly col-
leagues. From what passed on the occasion
to which I refer, I gather that there was an
inclination to call the Benchers of the Inns
of Court to account. It seems to me—and I
believe that I am right in the opinion—that,
so long as our Masters worthily represent the
dignity of the profession, we Members of the
Inner and Outer Bar have no tangible cause
for complaint.
But I fancy the leading subject at the 4
Forensic Congress was the Long Vacation.
J.# from the numerous letters that have
reached me from both branches of the pro-
fession, this is a matter of the first import-
ance to all of us. I have been asked by
many of my learned and friendly colleagues,
and my nearly equally learned and even more
friendly clients, to give my opinion on the
subject. One respected correspondent who
hails from Ely Place, writes, “How could
you possibly recover from the wear and tear
of your arduous practice in Trinity Term,
had you not a part of August and nearly the
whole of September and October ready to hand
for recuperation?” I quite agree with Sir
GEORGE—I should say, my respected corre-
spondent—that as I near “the long,” I do
feel the need of rest—nay, even considerable
rest. Then a learned friend who represents
not only the Bar, but chivalry in its forensic
form, sends me a caricature of “DICKY.W.”
that would suggest that were the holidays
to be decreased, a wearer of a most distin-
guished order, and an athlete of no small
fame would be reduced to a condition of com-
plete collapse. Once again, an ornament to
our Bench—perhaps the greatest ornament-
honours me with the suggestion that were
we to lose a month of recreation, it might
sadden the terraces of Monte Carlo, and
eclipse the merriment of Newmarket Heath.
It is needless to state that all these com-
munications have had *::::: with me.
Still, I have deemed it desirable to approach
the subject with an open mind. It seems to
me (and no doubt to many others) that the
uestion narrows itself into a matter of
finance. I have therefore taken PortINGTON
into my counsels, and examined with unusual
care the pages of my Fee Book. After much
consultation with my admirable and excellent
clerk, and an exhaustive audit of the figures
of my forensic honoraria, I have come to the
matured conclusion that the lengthening or
the shortening of the Long Vacation does not
affect me financially in the very least.

happy events that please everyone. , Hearing what people say, it is
difficult to decide which the more pleased, Liberals at being turned
out, or Conservatives at ; in. On Ministerial side happiness
marred in individual cases by being left out of the Ministry.
“I’m getting * in years now, Toby,” said THE MARKiss, “and
I’ve had pretty long experience in making up Ministries. ...But I
assure 3. I’ve been staggered during last week, including in
special degree the last hour. The more offices assigned, the narrower
becomes the basis of operation, and the more desperate the rush of
the att .# party. .You'd be surprised if you saw the list of men
who have asked me for something. As a rule they don't put it in
that general way. They know precisely what they want, and are
not bashful in, giving it a name, though they usually end, up by
saying that if this particular post is disposed of, anything else will
do. In fact, like the cabman and the coy fare, they leave it to me... I
am, as you know, of placid temperament, inclined to take genial
views dmy fellow-man. But I declare, if the process of forming a
Ministry under my direction were extended beyond a fortnight, I

ing Toryism, MICHAEL HICKs-BEACH,
“BEACH,” said SARK, coming back to the English tongue, “has
never either manoeuvred or wobbled. He is of the very flower of
English political squirearchy. He has principles, and convictions,
and he sticks to them. So, when a Conservative Ministry arrives, he
walks in last, and, on the Treasury Bench, takes any seat others may
not have appropriated. Consider these things, Toby, my boy. If

you're bringing up any pups to a political career, the study may be
useful to you and them.” PRIVATE HANBURY got his stripes. After
pegging away for years at Treasury, PRINCE ARTHUR now put him
on to repel attacks. Will do it well too. An admirable appointment.
Sad thing about it is, that it breaks up a cherished companionship;
parts friends by the height and width and back of Treasury Bench.
Business done.—Ministers sworn in.
Thursday. — Notable change come over Bolton PARTY in the
last few days. Unmistakable Retreat-from-Moscow look about
him. When Liberal Govern-
ment went out and Joseph
handed THEMARKIsstothefront,
Bolton PARTY beamed with large
content. The Sun of Austerlitz
shone once more.
“Joseph,” he said, folding his
arms in historic fashion, letting
his massive chin rest on his
manly chest, what time his noble
brow shone with the radiance of
mighty thoughts, “Joseph will
never forget his early friend and
ally. It’s not as if at the last
General Election I stood under
his flag, won a seat, and laid it
at his feet. I fought North St.
Pancras as a Home-Ruler, cap-
tured it, and before new Par-
liament was many months old,
went over to other side, making
early rift in lute of GLADstone's
majority. Some men in such
circumstances would have gone
back to their constituency and
said, ‘Dear boys, there's a mis-
take somewhere. You elected
me on a particular understand-
ing. Since then I have taken
another view of the situation and
of my duty. So I come back,
return the trust you placed in
my hand, and give you oppor-
tunity of electing me again, or
choosing another man.' That
might haveled to inconvenience.
Wouldn't run any risk; so kept
my seat, and voted steadily with
Joseph. Suppose they won't put
me in the Cabinet right off? But
I shall have choice of first-class
Under-Secretaryship. Shall it
be War, Navy, or Home Depart-
ment? Anyone excellent; but
obviously I must go to the War
Qffice. . Don't know whether there's any particular uniform for
Financial Secretary. If, not, could soon knock one up from old
portrait of the Emperor.”

to be sent for. Nothing came, till W."..."; rs

ralty, JESSE Collings was installed at the Home Office, and Powell

Then, I met TROTTER of Trinity at Piccadilly Circus, “By the
way,” said he, “I suppose you have heard about poor old BRIggs?”
“No 1" I cried. “What of him?” “Oh, I thought you would be
sure, to know, or I would have broken it to you more gently.”
“Why?” I asked, with apprehension. “Has anything happened
to him P’’ “Well,” he replied, with some hesitation, “I-er—I
hardly like to tell you. You were such a friend of his.” “You
don’t mean to say that he is—?” “Dead? No, poor fellow, not
dead exactly, but worse than that, I fear. He has become a New
Man, you see.” I looked at TROTrER in bewilderment. , “Why, you
see, he is married-yes, he married the O'GREss, you know. Poor
BRiggs!, I saw him yesterday, and, upon my word, I should
scarcely have known him. But go and see him yourself; you will
never believe my story.”
TROTTER wrote me the address on a card, and the next day I
called. The maid looked somewhat surprised when I asked for
Mr. BRiggs. He was at home, oh, yes, he was at home, but she
didn't know whether he could see me or not, as he was feeding the
baby. This announcement rather staggered me, but I pulled myself
together sufficiently to assure her that I was an old friend of
Mr. BRIggs; ald, on, learning, this, she asked me to walk upstairs,
“This is the nursery,” she said, when we had reached the topmost
storey. “You will find Mr. BRIggs inside.”
I opened the door, and what a scene greeted me! There was
BRIggs, my old friend BRIggs, the gallant BRIggs of Balliol, rocking
ceaselessly to and fro the while he crooned in a low monotone to a
bundle of pins and flannel that lay cradled in his arms. I spran
forward to § him by the hand. He laid his finger on his lips, an
in an agonised whisper murmured, “Sh!—You'll wake the baby!”
I controlled myself, and sank into a chair, to which he motioned me.
BRIggs hushed the infant anxiously for a minute or two until it was
a that.” SHE WON THE SWEEP 1 and the Demon Camera !”
It grieved me to hear poor BRIggs talk in this fashion, but there

me.”, “Forbade you?” (“Yes, yes, indeed. , Oh, Robinson, you
do not know my wife l’” I was inwardly º: my stars that I
had not this honour when BRIggs, overcome with his emotion, sud-
denly flung º his arms and covered his face with his hands. The
action upset the equilibrium of the baby, which rolled off his lap,
fell on the floor, and awoke with a scream. With a cry of dismay
BRIgGs caught up the bundle, and tossed, it violently up and down
addressing it the while in such intelligible terms as these—“ And
did it wake its darling ducky Cutsababoo, it did! It was a naughty
cruel Dada, it was 1”
It would be hard to say which made the greater noise, BRIgGs or
the baby; but BRIgGs had the staying power, and after a fight the
baby gave it up. - BRIggs gazed at it as it lay exhausted in his arms,
then turning to me, he said, “I think the Cutsababoo has done
crying now, Robinson. Will you excuse me if I sing him to by-
byes?” In olden days BRIGGs had a glorious baritone voice, and to
hear him sing the Balliol Boating Song was a musical treat. I there-
fore readily agreed to stay and listen. ... “The Duckydoo is very
particular,” explained BRiggs. “He will only go to sleep to his
own ickle tune, The New Lullaby.
“Mummy has gone to the city,
Cutsaba-Cutsabahoo!
But Mummy will think of her Pretty,
And bu #. a little toy too.

And show him his beautiful toy.

BRIggs had just reached the end of the second verse when his
keenly sensitive ear caught the sound of a latchkey turning in the
door. A look of terror crossed his face. “It’s she It's she '''
he cried... “Oh, RoRINsoN, if she finds you here!, Oh, if you love

CUE FOR CANWASSERS.
(By a Cynic.)
[“In all the doubtful constituencies the result
may be regarded as depending largely upon the
persuasion and argument brought to bear upon indi-
vidual electors.”—The Yorkshire Post.
PERSUASION ? Argument?. Very nice names
For Radical Caucusites, Primrose Dames,
And other retailers of party riddles,
Er parte statements, and taradiddles!
Gregarious voters, of old bribes did you all;
Now ar ent deals with the “individual.”
With the man—or his wife—you must seek
Occasion,
Canyasser clever, to try “persuasion.”
To .* ” that BLOGGs is the likeliest
Cnap
To pour prosperity into your lap;
To “persuade” the Missus' that that
McQUIRK
Will deprive her “man” of his beer and
Wor
Qh, sweet are the virtues, upon occasion,
Of moral (or even immoral)'suasion!
When * run out and when money's all
spent,
Then, then comes the value of “argument.”
And if the “argument” takes the form
Qf orders and jobs in a perfect storm;
And when “persuasion” the future gauges
A promise of liquor and higher es;
y, then the result is the same almost,
wi; yºu and me, and the (Yorkshire)

complete satisfaction of an appreciating and
growded audience...The play should run from

again that she became quite sane and chatted amicably with two or
three of the leading chorus “up stage” until it suddenly occurred to
her that she must, go, mad again, which she did at once, most
effectively. After this “ Fra poco,” the swan-like (if swan a tenor)
death-song of Edgardo, cannot go for its value unless sung by a
most popular and highly-gifted tenor. So it stands to the
credit of Signor DASH-My-WIGNAs that, in this, he was enthu-
siastically applauded, and soon after “laid him down and dee’d”
in the midst of an admiring and more-or-less sympathetic Chorus.
Great opera for Chorus giving expression to their feelings. How
they cry or laugh, and, point and gesticulate and threaten, and
sympathise as guests in low dresses without anything distinctively
Scotch about them, except in the case of one lady over whose
shoulder I fancy, I detected a tartan, scarf, of clannish pattern.
Normanno, played by, I think, IGINIo CoRSI (which name, in com-
pliment to the national Scotch liquor, ought to have been changed to
‘Iwiskio CoRSI”), bore remarkable resemblance to Markis o' SALIS-
BURY. I do not remember ever having seen or heard Lord SALISBURY
as a vocalist. To be remembered as The MELRA Night of the Season

ordinarily indifferent to fate of heroine in last act, wait till bitter end.
They only quit when quite sure Carmen cannot possibly sing any more.
Madame MELBA, who, by request of the Management”-how modestly
is this put, 0 DRURIolanus OPERATIQUs!—“has kindly consented to
play ichaela," exceeded the terms of her amiable contract, as she not
only “played' Michaela, but sang the music superbly, her singing

SCRAPS FROM CHAPS.
THE hedgehog is sometimes accused of helping himself to a drink
from a recumbent cow, but his larger relative, the domestic pig, is
to be even still more commended for his enterprise. According
the Western Daily Mercury, in a farmyard in the parish of Uff-
culme a pig was observed to rear on his hind legs and suck milk
from a cow. This sight must have enormously impressed the spec-
tator. But it ought to have been a dog.
SURELY a Radical Unionist is a new departure in politics. Mr.
STRAUss, who is opposing Mr. ConyBEARE, M.P. for the Camborne
division of Cornwalſ, in reply to a question at Cusgarne said that he
was a Radical Unionist, but the name Liberal was good enough for
him. . Mr. STRAUss is to be, congratulated on his new political
“Doctrinen”; but, if he should succeed in defeating Mr. ConyBEARE,
he seems likely to lead the Whips a pretty dance.
IT seems a little hard on a Parliamen candidate when he is
seriously misrepresented by his own friends. This is what Mr.
MICHAEL WILLIAMs has suffered in the St. Austell division of Corn-
wall at the hands of his friend Canon BUSH. With every intention
of doing Mr. WILLIAMs a good turn, the worthy Canon fired off a
letter in the local press containing a serious misquotation of a speech
said to have been made by Mr. WILLIAMs about the false doctrines
of the Nonconformists. The explosion of this shell in the Noncon-
formist camp has not improved Mr. WILLIAMS's chance of success
and he probably believes in the truth of the old saying, that “ Good
wine needs no Bush.”
A PULL ALL TogetheR.—What our forefathers would have called
seeking an explanation from one's representative,” is now, in
these days of political slang, known as “pulling your member's
leg l’” Wiś what happened in West Fife:
“Mr. WEMyss said, that if they returned him they would have the ad-
vantage of being able to run down to WEMYss when he did anything wrong
and pull his leg at the cost of a sixpence in train money, whereas, if they
wanted to pull Mr. BIRRELL over the coals, it would cost them £3 to go to
London.”
The electors would certainly seem to “have the pull" by Mr.
WEMYSS's É. ; but why didn’t some heckler retort by saying
that in pulling a candidate's leg voters must be careful not to get
hold of a calf P
Slow TRAINING.-The Cork County National Teachers' Associa-
tion has passed a resolution that “for the sixth class” the&;
of the British, Isles is enough, and “that the British Colonies be
held over till the examination in the second, year.” But, how.will
the British Colonies like being held over ? And is not Ireland itself
going to be a self-governing British Colony—some day.” But that
idea, too, seems “held over” for the present. The National
Teachers, however, are true Nationalists, because they also resolved
that “Professors of Irish should be appointed in all the Training
Colleges.” If females, they will be expected to wear the Celtic
fringe, of course.
READY AND WILLING (in the Cornell-Leander Fiasco), -One crew
wasn't “ready,” but the starter was “WILLAN’—like Barkis.
The Cornell crew was ready and, willin'. So, they had the starter ||
with them, at all events; and, they started. ...Angry s in
described the proceeding as “Willanous.” So it was, -from one
point of view.
ELECTION PARADoxes.—Standing for a seat, and running against
a sitting Member.

the beautiful England! One speaks in Italy of the cielo inglese,
when the sky is grey and overcast. For the first time I come now
in the my ship to the of her country. Ecco, the sky is blue ! In
the Qur country so many things are blue—the sky, the sea, the lakes
the distant *mountains, ut in the our language not there is the wo
“blue.” One says “azure” or “turquoise,” but not the general
term “blue.” Therefore before I come to Éngland I think, “We
italians see the colour blue, but not can say it, and these english
have the word, but see never the colour.” And ecco I arrive, and
the sky is blue!. Not it is the blue of Napoli, not it is the blue of
Genova, and perhaps it is to-day only, but ceramente it is blue. It
is much curious.
Also I have found other things blue. Some time the sea is pale
blue. Some time the milk is pale blue. Andone english º to me,
“The sea was rough and the wind blue,” but this not can I under-

But perhaps the chaff is much helpful for the diº like the
english brown bread, which some brave men eat. e his friends
say also, “He chafts till all is blue.” Perhaps when one eats the
chaff the eyesight is altered, lt is much curious. There are other
things blue, in England. There are "the bluejº one my friend
says to me that this phrase is the french ennui. Then I have not
it seen yet, for it is always festa since our arrival. I have heard
that the blues are at Oxford and at Cambridge, above all at the

beautiful. Ah, the exquisite eyes | Ah, la bellissima signorina

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
EX-HON, PRIVATE A, BRIEFLESS, JUN., ON THE
I. O. C. R. W. C. AT BISLEY.
IT is scarcely necessary to say that during the sitting of the Courts
I have little time for what may be termed recreation. So when I
visited Bisley on the occasion of the competition for the Ashburnham
Shield, it was in a semi-military and semi-forensic capacity. It was
no doubt pleasing to see one's schoolfellows of a later generation
maintaining the prestige of a common Alma Mater; but the chief at-
traction in my eyes of the successor to
Wimbledon was the presence under
canvas of much that is left of the
“Devil's Own.” And here let me
pause for a moment to discuss the
traditional derivation of the alterna-
tive title of the Inns of Court Rifle
Wolunteer Corps. I believe His late
Majesty King WILLIAM THE FourTH
(of marine memory) is usually believed
to have been the first to call his
lawyer warriors by the name that, to
certain minds, has had since an un-
sympathetic significance. I am . of
opinion that the Sailor Sovereign
merely confirmed a title that had
already been obtained by usage. It is
more than possible that the initial
supporters of the I. O. C. R. W. C.
}. ... †: briefs of
their own, but frequently appearing as
º “learned” but absent X; It
º is needless to hint to the Bench and
Bar that I refer to “devils.” If my
assumption is correct, then indeed
would the Battalion be justly known
to fame as “the Devil's Own.”
I wish I could deny the reports that
have found their way into the papers
that the I. O. C. W. C. is less
tº prosperous than it was of yore. Per-
_F77 sonally, I have it on my conscience
~&—" - that I have not for many years ap-

ranks. The occasion was a prize distribution in Lincoln's Inn Hall.
As an honorary member I was posted in the front rank of “A.”
Company. Then came the perplexing command, “Fours right,”
which, so far as I was concerned, ended in disaster. A little later
I retired from all active military service, and have remained in
retreat ever since. Still, at the sound of the bugle my pulse
quickens, and I feel that had I chosen the Tented Field instead
of the Forum for the exercise of my professional duties my career
would not have suffered in prosperity from the alteration. In fact,
I believe that with the conditions changed I should have had just as
§: a chance of ...; Commander-in-Chief as Lord Chancellor.
ut these are regrets, that are out of place in the columns of a
riodical that fº. the interests of the universe in general, while
ostering the loftiest aspirations of the legal profession in particular.
So I cast them aside as unworthy the attention of a counsel, a soldier,
and a gentleman.
Let me return to the I.O. C. R. W. C. at Bisley. I found “those
of the faithful who have been true to their trust” defending them-
selves—there was no trace cf defiance in the action—from the fierce
fire of the noonday sun by wearing straw hats and º:
flannels. It was a pretty picture, that made by the martial lawyers
at their mid-day parade, , The tents, the tubs, the kitchen
utensils, and last, but not least, the mess-house, with its dinin
saloon and ante-room. Alas, that the stability of the latter shoul
inappropriatel, Alas, that the corps, once the pride of the Volun-
teer Service, should be reduced to four companies, and (so I believe)
have lost its adjutant 1 Ichabod! . How the mighty have fallen!.
As I watched the sad and yet impressive tableau old memories
flocked upon me. . Where was the private who caricatured his
Colonel, and showed how a shako could be combined with a horse-
hair wig, and yet look military and forensic * Where was the lance
corporal who invariably confirmed his captain's commands with an
“as your Lordship pleases?” ...Where was the rear- wag who,
on being told to charge, said he “must leave that sort of thing to his
clerk, who kept his fee-book?” ...Where was the vocalist who would
.# the songs of J.L. MoLLoy, Barrister-at-Law, and knew the ins
and outs of “The Maske of Flowers?” All of them gone, and their
places scarcely filled by new comers! And, as I azed upon an
emergetic private of the I. O. C. R. W. C., apparently preparing to
meet the dºi, of an expected detachment of hungry lunchers, I
wondered whether anything could be done to revive the fortunes of
the Grand Old Battalion. Could the hours of leisure of the
warriors be occupied by regimental trips down the river, regimental
drags to the races, regimental dinners to one another, regimental
yisits to the play, regimental strolls in the Row, regimental bicycles
in Battersea Park?...I fancy something of this {#. already been
.#. Then, if Barristers do not flock in sufficient numbers
to the banners of the Lamb, the Horse, and the Griffin, why not throw
ºpen the ranks to wealthy persons—so to §º: of the leaders of
litigation? Again I imagine some such plan has already been under
consideration.
And, as . I thought the matter over, I became gloomier and
gloomier. So sad was I that I had to visit the adjacent cemetery,
to revive, under the modified merriment of the place, into com-
parative cheerfulness. The mere recollection of the I.O. C. R. W. C.
unmans me. It is better that I should pause, for I can write no more.
Pump Handle Court, July 12, 1895. A. BRIEFLEss, JUN.
THE CRY OF THE COUNTER.
(By a Shopkeeper who had hoped better things of the Season.)
GREAT Scott! Sold again! It's all up with the Season,
Though Summer is Summer, and Goodwood's not gone!
We Shopkeepers hoped for good luck, and with reason
For things did look bright. But once more we are
Done, clean as a whistle! A General Election 1
Sprung on us, through BhopRick, and cordite, and stuff!
A plague on both parties, a curse on each section 1
Your M.P.'s a mooncalf, a muddler, a muff!
The weather was stunning ; Death had not been busy
With Royalties—bless 'em!—and London was full ;
And though of course Rosep}:RY is not a Dizzy,
He did win the Derby, which gave him some pull.
The Parties kept wrangling, but nobody bothered;
They didn't make progress, but none of us cared;
Though LABBy played tricks, or SILoMo pothered,
We stuck to our counters, unshocked and unscared.
And now, betwixt grass-time and harvest, the duffers
Fight over sheerfudge and kick over the show.
And so once again the poor Shopkeeper suffers.
A murrain on HARcouBT, a p º: upon Joe'
For policy BALFour sets forth.” Dissolution,”
And thinks he has scored. Had I temper, and breath,
And his ear, I could smash up his smart elocution.
Iſis game's Dissolution,--to us it means death.
The fat's in the fire, and the spark’s in the powder,
We're in for a long spell of wigs on the green.
Our clients will scatter, and louder and louder
.Will swell the fool-chorus of partisan spleen.
Sir BQTTLEBY SNIPE must be off beyond Humber,
And sweet Lady SPENDwell goes Primrosing, south,
And It poor shopkeeper, may just as well slumber,
With rage in my heart and my thumb in my mouth.
Oh, slaves of the shop, from Pall Mall to far Peckham,
Say, is it not time that you rose and rebelled ?
The parties just play with us. Can we not check 'em P
By Jove, if one chorus of shopdom but swelled,
Like the working man's howl, on those Westminster wobblers,
The sweet little game they all play it might stop.
For Scoialist dockers and Radical cobblers
They’ve ears; but they’re deaf to the Cry of the Shop.
The rents, rates and taxes pile higher and *.
The Stores undersell us—and cop ready cash!
The Hebrew monopolist, fiercer and slyer
Than tiger-cat, schemeth to send us to smash.
The landlord rack-rents us, and then pops the profit
He draws out of us into syndicate Stores!
I tell you the shopkeeper's life is a Tophet,
M.P.'s play at “Progress,” and we pay all scores.
And then they ask me for my vote l l l Why, what guerdon
Have I for my votings these twenty years past?
Continual addition to back-breaking burden!
I say the last straw has been laid on, at last;
At least upon this individual camel.
To forward true Progress I don't think I'm loth,
But sick of prolonged Party trick, trap, and trammel,
If I had my wish, I would—vote against both /
One ;
THE MoDERN Ixion. — This mythological character finds his
present representative in a shareholder Bound to the Great Wheel

In which case Modern Ixion ought to be an exceptionally lucky
person.

ELECTION INTELLIGENCE.
TOBY ONCE MORE M.P.
ON Monday the Electors of Barkshire assembled in the great hall
of their county town to elect a Member to serve in the Fourteenth
Parliament of Queen Victor/A, The High Sheriff presided. Owing
to the constitutional rule which forbids Peers to take part in Parlia-
mentary electoral proceedings, the Lord Lieutenant of the county
was precluded from showing himself on the platform. It was said
that, iſ: to be entirely out of so interesting and popular an
event, his lordship was present disguised as a tide-waiter. Our re-
ſ||
º
“Carried unanimously.”
presentative, however, did not observe in the throng any person in
nautical dress.
The hall, which was crowded to its utmost capacity, was gaily
decorated with flags. Across the full length of the hall was sus-
pended a banner bearing the proud device “BARKs's Is willIN’.”
Our esteemed ex-Member was accompanied on the platform by the
º county gentry of all shades of political opinion. On taking
is seat in the front row of chairs, he was received with rounds of
Kentish fire, made in Barkshire. Having been proposed and seconded
in eulogistic terms, report of which he has expressed a desire, we
should suppress, the High Sheriff inquired if any elector desired to
propose another candidate P
“I should think not,” said a burly Barkshire farmer, ominously
grasping a stout blackthorn.
After this no one seemed disposed to move, and the High Sheriff
declared ToRY, M.P., duly elected. There were loud cries for the
Member, who, overcoming natural and usually insuperable diffidence,
got on his hind legs.
“Brother electors,” he said, “it is an old saying, ‘What Bark-
shire thinks to-day, England will do to-morrow.' 'Obviously some
inaccuracy underlies the aphorism, since whilst you have to-day
thought me worthy of being elected your Member, it’s no use
England coming round to-morrow and asking me to represent it in the
Commons House of Parliament. This is the fourth time Barkshire
has done me this honour; and base indeed is the man—(A Voice,
* Who pays”)—who could, be insensible to such testimony of confi-
dence and esteem. Brother electors—(A Voice, ‘Who stole the
Emperor William's uniform 2' Disturbance at the end % the hall.
Another Voice, Chuck him out.") No, electors of Barkshire, let
him stay. If he is put outside, he loses the opportunity of observing
your behaviour, and learning how gentlemen comport themselves
when, publicly assembled , in discharge , of , a solemn duty.
(Loud cheers. A Voice, That fetches 'em.") I was about
to observe, when our friend's feelings temporarily overcame him, that
since I entered the room. I have had a number of questions handed
up to me. . They are a little late, since I am no longer a candidate
but am duly elected. That, however unusual the case may be,
makes no difference. The first question is: ‘Will you, if elected,
see that every man in Barkshire over fifty years of age has three
acres of the best land in the parish, with a cow for every adult child
and a calf a-piece for each infant in arms ?? Certainly; I hope I
may live to see established those desirable conditions as between man
and man. (Cheers.) Another esteemed friend asks: “Do you
understand Local Veto to mean that a man may go into the public-
house, take his noggin, or what not, and when asked to pay may
refuse?” I conlol not if I tried E. my views on the situation more
clearly. The Veto, as you all know, is a Latin word meaning to
vete, or, as we say in English, to refuse to stump up. A public-
house is, according to 19 Wict. c. 190, a locality. Local Veto is, there-
fore, the inalienable right of the English citizen as defined by my
friend. (Loud cheers.) “Are you in favour of Equalisation of the
Rates ?’ To be frank with you, my idea of rates is that they should
be equalised to the extent that makes them absolutely impalpable.
(“No, no.’ ‘Yes, yes.” Uproar under the gallery. Cries of ‘JUDAs!”
A free fight, during which a man was ejected, omitting to take his
coat with him.), Don't put him out; don't put anyone out. If
there’s a renewal of the interruption, form a ring round the man;
then we will see where we are. ere’s another question: "Do you
approve of Ice Creams made in foreign prisons smuggled over here in
barrel-organs and ground out in our streets, ruining the digestion of
our working men?', That is a question which hardly seems to need
reply from a patriotic Englishman. But I will say—and you observe
I say it emphatically—No. (Loud cheering.) 'Are you in favour of
a. Second Chamber, or..do you go the length of Tenification ?”
That is a very nice question. It shows how deeply and intelligently
the men of Barkshire study the questions of the day. ... It is not a
matter on which I, for one, care to dogmatize; I will therefore
content myself with saying, that between two and ten, we might
find the happy medium. (More cheering, the audience rising to their
feet, waving hats and handkerchiefs.) Now, gentlemen, that's all
the questions I have, and I hope you’ll agree that I have answered
them frankly. Ah! here's another one coming up. (A dirty piece
of paper is passed from hand to hand till it reached the hon,
ember.) "Could you lend me five bob till Saturday night º'
(Laughter, in which the hon. Member heartily joined.) I think,
gº it is time we now proposed a vote of thanks to the High
heriff.” (This was carried unanimously, and the meeting broke up.
A torch-light procession conducted the popular member to his family
seat, The Kennel, Barks.)
A LITERARY TURN.
THERE was a case in the Edinburgh Court of Session the other
day, which shows what is thought of authors north of the Tweed-
and not by publishers, either. A witness remarked of a “defender”
that “he was of a literary turn of mind, and he thought that spoiled
him.” Many persons have had similar thoughts, but they have
generally refrained from uttering them quite so bluntly.
Mistress HATHAway rejoiced in a daughter christened ANNE,
Whose proceedings she regarded with concern;
Quoth she-“That WILLUM SHAKSPEARE as a son-in-law I ban.
Why? Because he has a literary turn.”
Growled Sir W-LL-M, on perusal of a certain Life of Pitt–
“Well, we all unquestionably live and learn;
But, in spite of Dizzy's precedent, I don't believe one bit
In a Premier with a literary turn.”
Said W-LS-L-Y, when a recent work he blankly had surveyed–
“To answer this biography I yearn.
What an admirable soldier H-ML-Y might, perhaps, have made,
If he had not had a literary turn!”
“JUST ON THE CARDs.”—Herr IFF's orchestra. In how uncer-
tain a state of mind would a telegram from Herr IFF leave the
giver of the entertainment who, having requested wire informing him
whether Herr IFF and his band could come, should receive this
reply: “If can come will be there at hour stated.” This supposes
that some well-informed, grammatical, telegraphic young lady-clerk
has corrected the spelling of “IFF.” A propos of IFF, a complete enter-
tainment would be a recital by the Weteran Howr of WATTs' poems,
accompanied by IFF's band; and a reading from Le Château d'If.
INTELLIGIBLE, BUT NOT CLEAR.—“I think,” said Mrs. R.'s married
niece, “that good singing is quite wasted on an ordinary evenin
y. Now I remember an evening when SANTLEY sang in a crowd
rawing-room at our house, and a pin might have dropped.”
A DECISION. The DR. G. TESTIMONIAL.-The D. T. is a good
judge of ular sentiment, and, attired as a Judge, is D. T. ermined
that '95 s º be remembered as “the Year of GRAce.”

My calm into mental strife;

And henceforth my name in

OF Cours E. —Directly it
was known that Sir WILLIAM
HARCOURT had accepted an in-
vitation to contest West Mon-
mouthshire, and that Mr.
WARMINGTON had generously
offered to retire in his favour,
there was a rush for the evi-
dent joke of styling the self-
effacing Q.C. “Mr. WARM-
INGPAN.” It is uncertain
which Pº. was the first to
get the Warmingpan into its
sheets. Sir WILLIAM did not
find the vacated seat too hot
to hold him. Just nice.
NEw TITLES.–Sir HENRY
Loch is created Baron Loch of
Drylaw, The title will be ap-
propriately written out on
parchment. Forwas there ever
a more dry-as-dust title than
that of a Barren Loch and Dry
Law!! Mr. STERN comes to the
front as Baron WANDsworth :
not of Wandsworth Common,
“ and so,” as a Shakspearian
clown might say, “the title is
uncommon.” Finally

BALLOTERY,+The Cork Agricultural Society had before it a pro-

he Chairman said,
“It was to be understood that the grounds would only be let on the under-
standing that no drink would be sold, and that no political meetings or gamb-
ling would be allowed.”
Rather hard on politicians this, to bracket their patriotic endeavours
with pitch-and-toss and alcoholic indulgence! If politics are like
strong drink, nobody at any rate can call them a form of “refresh-
ment” But defeated candidates will quite agree that the game of
“bleu et jaune” is a good deal worse than “rouge et noir.”
A DAY SHIFT.-From the North British Daily Mail comes news
of a daring electoral outrage. The Liberal candidate wanted to
address the colliers in one of the Lanarkshire towns; but his meetin
was very poorly attended. The cause was that the colliers were
waiting at the bottom of the pit ready to be drawn up, but “it was
found necessary to send down an extra quantity of wood at that
particular time”; so that the colliers could not get to the surface for
an hºur, when the political meeting was over I Smart man, the
Conservative agent in that division! The pitmen could not be
wound up, so the meeting was. It isn't only in Lanark that the
Liberal Party wants a liftſ --
“LITTERAL.” ThuTH.—The effects of the General Election on the
Press seem to be most marked in Ireland. An Irish contemporary
has the following:—
“IRELAND. THE WICERoy Alty to RE ABOLILHED.—Colonel SAUNDER-
son, addressing the Orangemen of Diamond, near Armagh, said that Lord
LALIs BURY's Government would bring in a Bill to obolieh the office of Irish
Viceroy.”
What is really to happen to the Irish Viceroy is rather mysterious,
Is he to be “abolilhed,” or only “oboliehed” P Perhaps “Lord
LA11-hury’ will kindly explain.
DRINKING SCENE OF THE FUTURE.
(In consequence of the Growing Demand for Lighter Liquors.)
SCENE-The interior of a Dining-room. The ladies have just left,
and the gentlemen are discussing their beverages.

Brown. I thought you would be deceived It was a cup, not the

Jones. I say, Brown, that was really very nice sherbet. Turkish

Brown. Neither. Came from the Stores. Home-made.
Jones. Well, it certainly was capital. I could have sworn that it
had been manufactured East of the Levant.
Brown. More likely East of Temple Bar. Ard now shall we have

Sir Guests. No, thanks! Really not l

Brown. Nonsense (Produces a pint bottle of lemonade.) Non-
sense, I repeat! Look here, my boys. (Locks door.) Not one of
you fellows shall leave the room until you have finished this /
[Draws cork of pint bottle, and distributes the lemonade amidst
the good-natured protestations of the revellers. Scene closes
in upon the Temperance orgy.
Not IN THE “NEwcASTLE PROGRAMME.”—Last week Sir CHARLES
FREEMANTLE, K.C.B., was presented with his portrait painted
by Hon. John Colli ER, in Hon. John's best style; and so, for
this work, CoLLIER cannot be “hauled over the coals.” A propos,
evidently the artist to paint the present Ministry should be a Collier,
as it is a Coalition Cabinet. If the Collier were a Radical, how
coal-black the portraits would come out!

*ARRY ON THE ELECTIONS.
DEAR CHARLIE,-0 ºp. 'ip, 'ooray, an' three
more, and a tigerſ Great Scott!
I’m as 'appy as ten on 'em, CHARLIE, though
thusty and thundering 'ot.
I’ve bin up to my #. in it this time, and
now these 'ere Polling Returns
Are 8-sending me slap of my chump, though
I’m sorry they didn't chuck BURRs.
Oh! I’m feeling 0 K and a, arf; I could
stand on my’ed with delight,
For the Rads are knocked out in three
rounds, 'Ome Rule’s smashed, and Old
land's all right.
And although it is late, and I'm tired, I'm
80 of our Glorious Win,
That. I feel I must sit down and drop yer a
line, mate, afore I turn in.
I’m the Pet of the Primrosers, Charlie, and,
'ang it, I’ve earned it all round,
For I’ve worked like a nig, and no error. It
suits me right down to the ground.
I've can and posted tremenjous, I’m
'usky with cheer and chi-ike,
And I’ve mounted the Unionist colours, and
blazed round the streets on a bike.
There was full arf a mile on us, CHARLIE, a
scarlet percession on wheels;
With Japaneselanterns a-flying, and 'underds
o' kids at our 'eels.
I felt I was “charging the guns,” like that
brave Ballyclava Brigade,
With shouts for “Lord MUNgo and Malt!”
and a little one in for “The Trade.”
I tell yer, old man, 'twos hexciting. We
dashed along Yulberry Scrubs.
And up the 'igh street a rare buster, 'ocrayed
by the bhoys at the Pubs. -
We scooted around for ten mile, the 'ole dis-
tance one thunderin' cheer;
And when we pulled up at the “Crown,” if
you’d just seen me lower the beer!
I lapped off a quart in one quencher.
“That's rippin'! ” sez I to the Bung,
“I felt liked a dashed wooden 'orse, with a
lump o' red leather for tongue.” -
“Ah!” sez 'e, “and jest fancy, old man, if
them Wetoers'ad their vile way,
Wy, I couldn't sell you a tankard, and you
wouldn't 'ave any say!”
But #. 'ow we squelched 'em
e got our man in two to one,
Though our neighbourhood used to vote Rad,
and a Tory was not in the run.
Wot beans it must be to old 'ARCOURT, wot
toko to LAwson and CAINE | - - -
Well, they’ve got their fair armser this time;
let us 'ope they won’t try it again.
Workin'-men on the Radical ramp? You
should jest 'ear wot I’ear, old pal.
Let big pots make the round o' the º and
they won't talk that footy fal-lal.
Labour wants º: and good wyges,
and likes to see England look big ;
And then, with its baccy and beer, it's all
one to it, Tory or Whig.
Wot's it care for Welsh Churches, or Scotch
'uns, as don't 'ardly enter its own P
And as to 'Ome Rule—for yer worker there's
dashed little meat on that bone.
Talk of Betterment, Progress, Peer-smashing,
and such-like, may do for the Clubs;
But all Labour gits is 'igh rates, shocking
trade, and a raid on its pubs.
Workman sex it's too good enough, CHARLIE;
believes as it’s better by far
To vote for Old SoL, a big Navy, an' maybe a
jolly good war.

Mrs. Cº. Oh, very often. I am so devoted to music,
you know, that I go whenever I can. And, talking of music, have
§ heard that new pianist, Herr-what is his name?—oh yes, Herr
IDowski ? He's too delicious for words!
Mr. L. No; I can't say that I go to concerts much. You should
talk to my daughter ETHEL–she's devoted to music, and they tell
me that she's got a really fine voice. I’m sure she practises enough.
Mrs. C. Indeed? Well, I’ve no voice, I’m sorry to say; but I
Plº, piano a little—only a very little, you know..
r. L. Wonderful what a lot of people do play in these days—
but one hears pianos and fiddles
(hastily)—not like you, of course;
# them are simply instruments of
going in every house, and most o
torture.
Mrs. C. (smiling). Rather a rash remark—isn't it? You've never
heard me º you see 1 (Mr. L. endeavours to protest.) Oh, but I
assure you I quite agree, with you. For instance, my next-door
neighbours are always making the most awful noises-playing and
singing morning, noon, and night. The wall is verythin, and I am
nearly driven crazy.
Mr. L. (warmly). My dear Madam, I can sympathise with you
entirely. I’ve often thought that Parliament ought to pass a Bill
for enforcing a close-time in domestic music. Of course it only
matters to me in the evening, but we’re troubled exactly in the
same way as yourself. And my poor ETHEL finds her singing con-
stantly interrupted by the disgusting row made by our next-door
neighbour. I suppose he must take a pleasure in annoying us—
anyhow he's jammed, his wretched piano right up against our
drawing-room wall, and bangs and thumps on it for about six hours
a day. Of course it would be bad enough if the fellow played well;
but you never heard such ghastly noises as he makes!
Mrs. C. How sorry I am for your poor daughter! Yes; people
complain in the pa and grumble, about street-bands and
piano-organs; but at least one can send them away—which, unfor-
tunately, one can't do in the case of next-door neighbours! How-
ever, I suppose I ought to be grateful that the people on the other
side don't play at all. ---
Mr. L. Ah! I live in a corner-house. But I think a little opposition
noise would almost be a relief—a kind of homºpathic cure, you know.
Mrs. C. One's quite enough for me. It’s been getting worse,
too, these last few weeks, and I’m delighted to meet a fellow-
erer. Come; can't we concoct some joint scheme of deliver-
ance P. Do you think it would answer if I sent round a polite
note—“Mrs. CRUMPINGTON, presents her compliments to. Mr.”—
whatever their name is—“and would be extremely obliged,”—
and so on. How would that do?
Mr. L. (decisively). Wouldn’t be the least use, I assure you, or
I’d have tried that plan myself long ago. The only result would be
that they'd make more row than ever, on purpose to score off you.
No, I fancy I’ve got a better plan than that.
Mrs. C. (eager #. . Oh, do tell me what it is l
Mr. L. Well, I happened to notice in a shop in Holborn the other
day one of these new American toys, it's a kind of small fog-horn,
driven by a pair of bellows. And the noise it makes is something
terrific, I assure you—loud enough to drown half-a-dozen pianos.
So I’ve ordered one of these, and as soon as ever that scoundrel
strikes up next door, I shall turn on the horn; then, directly he
stops, I’ll stop too, you see. Rather a good idea, don't you think?
Mrs. C. (much amused). It is, indeed! If only the poor wretch next
door knew what was in store for him Oh, if only I could silence my
enemy in that way!. But then, of course, I can't a blow a horn.
Mr. L. That isn't necessary; all you have to do is to work the
bellows, and the thing goes by itself. Really, I strongly recommend
you to invest in one. - -

THE CARETAKER.
Is it time to leave town P Yes, it is time to leave town, because
the good neighbours have put up their shutters (i.e., the shutters of
the good neighbours). Do all the good neighbours put up their
shutters? Yes, all put up their shutters, but one of them stays in
town at the back of the house. . Why does one of the good neighbours
stay in town at the back of the house? To escape the expense of
leaving town incurred by the other good º who have put up
their shutters. Is that expense a great one? Yes, a very great one.
Have they any other drawbacks P Yes, they have the annoyances of a
caretaker. at are the annoyances of a caretaker? The annoy-
ances of a caretaker are her husband, her children, her cat, her dog,
her mother, and all her relations. When a caretaker enters the
house of one of the good neighbours, is she accompanied by her
annoyances? Yes, the caretaker is accompanied by her annoyances.
Does the caretaker lead a happy life in the house of one of the good
neighbours? Yes, she leads a happy life, and so do her husband,
her children, her cat, her dog, her mother, and all her relations.
What do the relations of the caretaker do in the house of one of the
good neighbours? They smoke in the drawing-room in the house of
one of the good neighbours. If anyone calls to see the good neigh-
what does, the caretaker do? ... The caretaker generally
refuses to attend to the bell. Should the caretaker attend to the
bell, what does she do? She tells the caller who wishes to see the
good neighbour that she knows nothing of the master of the house's
movements (i.e., the movements of the master of the house). Does the
caller then retire under the impression that the house has been sold
up, and that, the good neighbour has entered the Court of Bank-
ruptcy (i.e., the Bankruptcy Court)? The caller does leave the house
under that impression. e this impression is being created in
London, is the good neighbour unconsciously attempting to enjºy
himself in Switzerland? Yes, the good neighbour is undoubtedly
attempting to enjoy himself in Switzerland, in spite of the cookery,
the lack of, accommodation, the expense, and the weather. If the
ood neighbour ceased to be unconscious, and became aware of
e damage that was being dyne to his credit by the caretaker,
what would that good neighbour do? The good neighbour
would probably swear.. Then, would the good language of the
§: neighbour change in its character? Yes; for it would become
e bad language of the bad neighbour. Would the bad language
of the bad º have any immediate effect upon the caretaker,
her husband, her children, her cat, her . her mother, and all her
relatives P - No, for the bad language wo &be uttered' in Switzer-
land, and the caretaker, her husband, her children, her cat, her dog,
her mother, and all her relatives would be in London. Then what
would the caretaker, her husband, her children, her cat, her dog,
her mother, and all her relatives do in the house of one of the good
neighbours during the protracted absence of the good neighbour on
the Continent? They would continue to smoke in the drawing-
room.
“HONOURS EASY.”
MR. TRELoAR wrote to the Times the other day d propos of Mr.
WILLIAMson's peerage. Messrs. TRELOAR and WILLIAMSON are in
the same business, i.e. the linoleum trade, and Mr. TRELOAR sug-
gested that Lord LINoLºuiſ would not be a bad title.” Quite agree
with him. Let persons take titles from some specialty of their trade
or calling. Suppose peerages granted to

Numerous variations will occur to readers. They can be for-
warded to our office as probably useful when the next “honours
easy” are dealt out.
“Oh, THE IRoNY of IT!”—Last week, whilst reports of Tory
successes in the boroughs daily reached London, the leading Liberal
paper, regardless of expense, had the walls covered with large
placards announcing that “the Daily News has the best election
intelligence.” “If this is the best,” said Sir WILLIAM HARcourt;
observing one of the placards on his way back from Derby, “I
shouldn't like to know the worst.”

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The Variety Stage, by CHARLEs
Douglas STUART and A. J. PARK
(FISHER. UNWIN), is a history of
the Music-halls from the earliest
period to the present time. ...And
a very, interesting history it is,
admirably told withal. Onecomes
upon names familiar in boyhood,
and is a little shocked to find that
the Great WANCE was really
named ALFRED PECK STEVENs.
The pages glow with pleasant
peeps of London at midnight, as
Pendennis, saw it, and as, once
at least, it was looked upon by
Colonel Newcome. It is sad to
find how many of the old favour-
ites of the music-hall fall upon
evil times, and even die in the
workhouse. SAM Collins was
more fortunate. He was sump-
tuously buried in Kensal Green,
where a marble pedestal carries
his portrait and his epitaph. This
lastis notable as containing what,
as far as my Baronite knows, is
the most audacious rhyme in the
English language. As it was ad-
mitted to consecrated ground, it
may perhaps be quoted here. “A
loving husband,” so it runs—
“A loving husband and a faithful
friend,
Ever the first a helping hand to lend:
Farewell, good-natured, honest-
hearted SAM, M.”

Could I escape at all from the

With some loquacious man who seeks

FRIDAY, July 19, 1895, memorable in annals
of British stage as a day set *:: for one
of the greatest triumphs of the Drama. Sir
HENRY IRVING, fresh from the honours of
Royal Windsor, received a further distinction
at the hands and hearts of his “brothers and
sisters” in that profession for which he has
done so much. Squire BANCROFT was the
: spokesman for the enthusiastic
audience of comedians and tragedians which
filled the Lyceum; yet before and behind the
footlights there was not a suggestion of
histrionics. Unlike, too, the great unpaying,
who have the dulness of their order, the
guests of Friday were remarkable for the
tremendous energy of their goodwill. If this
theatre had not long been seasoned to the
sounds of vociferous cheering, the demonstra-
tion might “ have brought down the house”
literally. Mr. Punch takes this opportunity
of joining in the demonstration, and drinks
to Sir HENRY IRWING. May the Knight of
the cheerful countenance prosper, accordi
to his deserts. And, if that wish is realised,
the lessee of the Lyceum will be one of the
happiest men on record.

was customary in Ireland to cali
almost everything a castle.” Quite

Is that strong heart, relaxed that iron will.

writing to Sir Robert PEEL, who had been

Fellows, said, “In ourismall community we
have four separate lodges, and I have asso-
ciated myself with them all.” Mr. G. may
now tº: as his signature, not the initials
“G. Q.M.,” but the new one of “O. F.O..”

MAINTAINING THE UNIon.—The Sheffield
Daily Telegraph, in referring to the success
of Mr. G. H. ALLsopp at Worcester, just prior
to that eminent Unionist taking unto himself
a wife, suggests that the newly-elected M.P.
should follow the precedent set by Mr. GRIF-
FITH-Boscawen in 1892, and give to each of
his bridesmaids a brooch with the amount of
his majority engraved upon it. This is all
very well in its way. But the total at Tun-
bridge was 933, while that of Worcester ex-
tended to four figures. So to give room for
labelling, the brooch should be changed to a
bracelet. A man bearing the honoured name
# Aſºº should be appropriately equal to
e XX's.
A QUESTION To OUTsIDERs.-"Won't you
come round?” was the invitation (as reported
in the Daily Graphic) given by Sir HENRY
IRVING (after his speech on Friday afternoon)
to his “friends in front.” But it is a ques-
tion addressed to many outside the theatre
and the theatrical profession; to all sorts
and conditions of men and women who still

close of the address, when he was greeted with loud calls for a
speech. In response to the call, he remarked that he had already
made eight or nine speeches that day, and must be excused from
making another. He had, however, enjoyed Mr. BIRRELL's speech
very much. . It was not for him to criticise it at that meeting, but
he might only say that he felt sure the electors of West Fife would
vote for whom they considered the best man and the man they
believed would do his duty. He then called for three .# cheers
for his opponent, Mr. BIRRELL. Votes of confidence were then put
for both candidates, when that in favour of Mr. BIRRELL was de-
clared carried. The opposing candidates then shook hands, and
departed evidently the best of friends.”
A ToTALLY different picture comes to us from Aston Manor, as I
judge from the following letter in the Birmingham Daily Gazette.
WHAT HAS BECOME OF IKE WARD :
To the Editor of the Daily Gazette.
SIR,-My attention has been drawn to an attack, made by Captain
GRIce-Hutch INson on a very respectable member of the National Society
of Amalgamated Brassworkers, Mr. IKE WARD. In your yesterday's issue
Captain GRICE-HUTch INsoN is reported to have said: “The last authentic
account he had of Mr. IKE WARD was that he was “bones' in some nigger
troupe on the sands of Scarborough.” Mr. WARD has been for some time
engaged as an organiser, and is a member of the Executive of the Railway
Workers' Union, has never been in a nigger troupe on the sands of Scar-
borough or anywhere else.
As the statement is calculated to damage the reputation of my friend Mr.
WARD, I am sure that the candidate for Aston will at once either give his
authority for the damaging statement or withdraw the aspersions on the
character of a respected labour leader.—Yours faithfully, . J. DAVIS.
70, Lionel Street, Birmingham, July 13.
BUT, after all, even if Mr. IKE WARD had chosen to employ his
leisure in performing on the bones in a nigger troupe on the sands at
Scarborough or elsewhere he would have done nothing to be ashamed
of. Obviously, however, Captain GRICE-HUTCHINSoN's account was
anything but authentic, and he had no business to cork Mr. WARD's
face in so gratuitous a manner.
'Tis a manifest error, this tale about bones—
(You may like what I say, or, if not, you may lump it).
For a worker in brass must produce the best tones
If–I don't say he did it—he blew his own trumpet.
In any record of electoral humour, Mr. MUNTZ, the member for
Tamworth, must hold a distinguished, place. Here is a report of
some of the remarks made by him at meetings in the Nuneaton
Division:—
Mr. MUNTz, in the course of his remarks, characterised Lord SALI's-
BURY's Government as the most able Administration that had ever held
office in any Parliament the world over. It was composed of all the great
intellect §. prior to the introduction of the Home Rule Bill, was divided
between the two great parties of the State. Now all that was left to the
Liberal party was the tagrag and bobtail. The late Radical Administration
was a failure under Mr. GLADSTONE, great man as he was, and a still
greater failure under Lord RoseBERy, to whom Her Majesty had presented
the Thistle. (Laughter.) As to agriculture, he said that he had a conversa-
tion with Mr. CHAMBERLAIN on the subject just before the dissolution. Mr.
Cham BERLAIN said to him, “MUNTZ, what are we to do for agriculture?”
and he replied, “That’s a big question. You have all the great talent and
all the great landed, interest in the country represented in the present
Government; and if the present Government can do nothing for agriculture,
there is nothing to be done for agriculture.” (Applause.)
After reading this I feel that the question of agricultural distress
is settled. Mr. CHAMBERLAIN. must, indeed, be a proud man at
having obtained so much valuable information in answer to a ques-
º which, as reported, sounds familiar almost to the verge of
rashness.
CAN pigs be kept at a profit? This was the question which con-
fronted the Devonport Guardians only the other day. The follow-
ing * from their proceedings will be read with breathless
interest:—
Mr. H. W., BRYANT moved “That the Guardians give up pig keeping,
either at the house or otherwise.”
Mr. HEALY seconded.—Mr. OLIVER, supported, and said they could buy
º tº heaper than keep pigs, and that every pig they had kept cost them
s. per ID.
Mr. J. GooDMAN said he was a “piggery man.” (Laughter.) He liked
the pig, he liked the º and he liked the profit that the pig brought. He
was surprised to hear Mr. Oliy ER say that the pigs cost 1s. per lb. He said
it did not cost them 24d. per lb.
Mr. Chew pointed out that the profit on pig keeping last year in the
house was £39.
Mr. PENBERTHY said the master entered in his books that it cost them
6d. per lb., and Mr. J. MooRE maintained that they could buy pork at 4}d.
per lb. The motion was lost, 8 voting for, and 18 against.
“I M a piggery man,” said GooDMAN, J., “though pigs are a wee
bit squealy; -
But I won't sit still to hear pigs denounced by BRYANT and scorned
by HEALY. - -
Let those who prefer it till the fields, and see what a year's hard dig
brings; - - - -
I like the Fig, and I like the pork, and I like the profit the pig
brings.”
Then §, he chawed Mr. BRYANT up, Mr. HEALY to dust he
ground, Sir ;
And MooRE maintained you could purchase pork at fourpence half-
penny a pound, Sir. . - - - -
But the piggery men prevailed by ten, a majority quite on the big
id
Slde, - - -
Since eighteen voted for pigs that day, and eight on the anti-pig side.
BROWN AND ME.
ME and Bhown has bin a having a lot of differences of opinion all
about the County Counsellers, which sumhows we carnt get to agree
together about em, not by nº manner of means. Andnow, §. lately,
we has been a having a lot of quarrells about the members of Parlement
in the Citty, and all round about
it, and, fortunetly, me and my
frends has wun nearly ewery place
where there has bin anythink like
a jolly good fight, and has now
wun nearly the hole blooming lot
on em! So that the poor County
Counsellers has hardly got a single
member of Parlement left among
the whole blooming lot, and is
obliged to have long rambling
speeches among theirselves jest to
fill up their idle time. . How they
can manage to keep things *
jest while they makes their ol
ong speeches, I carnt for the life
of me make out; but I am told
that they all agrees that its the
only means they has of keeping
up their old Charter; and altho
- - it isnt º much to brag about,
they all agrees its sumthink better than nothink.
.Lots of the poor chaps who has been acustomed to go about
different parts of London a braggin about the werry great figgers
: cuts, or was used to cut, afore the new changes as took place in
making amost everybody members of Parlement, is now obleeged to
do their werry best to keep things a going cumfertably, if possibel;
but its but poor work for em, and but a werry poor change for
things as was afore they was as they is.
Why, I’m litterelly told as how there is now lots of Gents as was
once Members of Parlement who aint now members, for nothink!
that it to say, not for nothink as is worth having. Why, I’m ewen
told as the County Counsellers, as belongs to the Tems Conserwency,
is now so ardly treated, that they werry offen carnt get enuff to do
to keep their time well employed, or to get enuff monney to pay them
their werry modderate wages; so eny boddy can werry easily emad-
gin what poor work it must now be for poor fellers as was once
Members of Parlement, and now aint not members of not nothink!
Sum of the old members tells me as they doesnot, despair ewen
et! for they are quite sure as how as numbers of the grand old
ories will stick to em as long, as theres any left; but I thinks as I
knows a trick worth too of that, and that is, to make the best of the
things, as is, and hope, the best for all the changes as time and
hoppertoonity will aford em of putting, a few things together as
their long xperience has tort em is easily turned to good “...

THE NAVAL MANOEUVRES.
(By our Special Expert, who has
been accorded the customary cour-
tesy extended to the Press.)
On board H.M.S. —-
— the –th, 1895.
FoEGIVE me for the vagueness
of my address, but it is the desire
of those in command that the
greatest secrecy should be ob-
served as to our movements.
“Are we the Blue Fleet or the
Red P” I asked only a few
moments ago of one of the chief
commanders.
“As you are the guest of the
Government,” was the immediate
reply, “you will not be allowed
to pay your money—except in-
directly to the collector of Re-
venue; but there is nothing tº
prevent... you from taking your
choice l’”
From this response you will see
that there is a strong inclination
on the part of the authorities that
are to remain reticent. However
it is only fair to say that the foºd
is excellent. Nothing could he
better than the wine; , and the
view on the quarter deck is capi-
tal. Still, this is scarcelv an
account of naval manoeuvring—
now is it? |
Well, I think I may reveal this
much. There are two fleets—a
Red Fleet and a Blue Fleet. The
Red Fleet has a number of ships
—so has the Blue. Then the Red
Fleet tries to out-manoeuvre the
Blue Fleet, and the Blue Fleet
returns the compliment. All this
takes place on the sea. No ship
is allowed to run on shore—unless
of course by force of circumstances
outside the control of the com-
mander. And when I had got as
far as this. I thought I would
make a further inquiry.

At this point I was interrupted.

prompt ºfy of the veteran I had
#. “Take my advice.

in your own mind that “Heads'

And so now I am taking the

spun my sixpence in the air. I
am to write no more to you. All
refuse to send my communica-
tions for me. So I place this
document in a bottle and throw it

that he may get his namesake's

Could not the little difficulty be
overcome with the aid of a coin

RoBERT call himself “Bob,” and
the second Mr. Robert “half a

matter amicably; although both,
no doubt, are worth considerably
more than a shilling.

A SEVERE CRITIC.—“SLATIN’
PASHA.”
RE-INCARNATION.
Monday.—Have just been reading in the Pall Mall Magazine a won-
derful story called “A Re-Incarnation,” by the author of “A Green
Carnation.” He seems fond of carnations. Re-Incarnation and Gre-
Encarnation. Should have been in the exhibition of the National Car-
nation Society at the Crystal Palace. His story tells how a man mur-
dered a white cat, and afterwards married its soul, re-incarnated in
the body of a Hºf woman with “china-blue” eyes and a large for-
tune. Marvellous! Must carefully avoid marrying young women
with “china-blue” eyes and large fortunes, though the latter might
not be so harmful.
Tuesday.—That theory of re-incarnation impresses me wonderfully.
Think about it all night. In the silent darkness remember that I
once stamped on a black beetle. My nurse called it “a black
beadle.” Think of this with horror. ill it come back to murder
me? Terrible! Get up still nervous. , Must go out into the air, and
sunlight, to dispel my gloomy thoughts. Stroll along Piccadilly.
To avoid a shower step into the Burlington Arcade. Heavens, what
is that by the entrance? It is a man in black—a black beadle!
Gaze at him aghast. It has come back, the soul of that harmless
crawling thing which I crushed in my boyhood, and now— Fly
while there is yet time! Ha! I am safe at home at last.
Wednesday.—Have now no doubt of this marvellous theory. It
is probable that re-incarnation may sometimes go the other way.
Will investigate at the Zoological Gardens. , Directly I see the
largest elephant I recognise my late mother-in-law. The large,
heavy form, the habit of trampling obstacles under foot–obstacles
such as myself—the very cap-strings, now become ears flapping in
the wind, all are there. She always poked her nose into everything,
and she does it now. What a proboscis she has l Must tell the
keeper the real truth to prevent mishaps. Tell him confidentially.
He grins. Assure him that I am quite serious. He leads me gently
by the arm to the exit, where the turnstile only turns one way, and
advises me to go home at once. - -
Thursday.-Fresh proofs every hour. Have just seen an omnibus
horse, with the long face, the §: yellow teeth and the general
expression of my uncle's second wife..., Greatly overcome, seek rest
.# refreshment in my club. What is that having lunch over there?
Don't tell me it is an old gentleman with white hair and mild, eyes.
No! It is my first rabbit, which died of starvation through my
carelessness. See, he is hungrily munching a lettuce! That is
conclusive.
Friday.--My great work on Re-Incarnation begun to-day. It
will astonish the world, for it is all true. By why have my friends
asked those two doctors to call? There is nothing the matter with
me. The two fools say I º: to give up all writing and keep quite
quiet in the country. Explain that it is impossible. They insist
with gentle firmness. Tell them I have no doubt they are the two
leeches I once took from the bowl at the chemists and put on m
little sister's neck, whence they were removed by the nurse an
ruthlessly slaughtered. -
Monday.—My diary has been interrupted, for I have been moving
to this hydropathic establishment, as those doctors called it, at
Colney Hatch. I don't like the place. Most of the visitors seem
mad. But probably many of these water-drinkers are mad;
Wouldn't they be surprised if they knew who I really am P. Ha, ha!
It will make a nice summer correspondence for the Daily Telegraph.
To-morrow I will write to that paper stating the actual facts.
I also am re-incarnated. I am, or rather I was, the Great Sea
Serpent.
MRs. R. was very sorry that the clergyman of her parish had been
compelled to leave. “You see,” she said, “the poor man fell off his
bicycle, and his doctor has told him that for some time he must try
an incumbent position. So he has gone away for another cure.”

SCRAPS FROM CHAPS.
ANOTHER IRISH PARTY l—The
snakesare coming back to Ireland!
In a Cork paper we read the fol-
lowing:—
Mr. Corn ELIUs Donov AN, while
crossing a grass field near Blarney,
encountered a snake, which at first he
believed to be an eel, and struck it
with his walking stick. Having killed
the reptile, he discovered it was a
snake, measuring 3 feet 9 inches.
Evidently a political omen of
some kind, this return of the
emigrants to Erin. What does
it portend?. Mr. M-RL-Y, on being
consulted, is “inclined to fanc
that the Cork snake is a i.
of Coercion, and shows that the
venom of Dublin Castle will soon
be at work,” Mr. G. B-LF-R, on
the other hand, says that “the
return of general confidence at the
advent of a Unionist Government,
and a really capable Irish Secre-
tary, has never been better ex-
emplified. Even the reptiles are
not afraid now to try Ireland as
a place of residence l’” And Mr.
J-ST-N M'C-RTHY has no doubt
at all that “the incidentis another
sign of the *i; Irish spirit of
disunion. id not St. Patrick
banish snakes from Ireland? And
ought not snakes, if they are
worthy of the name of patriots,
to obey St. P., and stay away?
l, they are returning, and
defying St. P.-just as R-DM-ND
defies me ! And,” added the
eminent leader, meditatively,
“I’ve often thought there was a
good deal of the eelabout him, too.”
“PEERs ARE CHEAP To-DAY.”—

Bailie WRIGHT, in supporting the
motion, said that if he had the power
he would make every man in that

Visitor. Because I am a member

THE AGE OF CULTURE.

are beginning to take a practical interest in it.”—A Morning Paper.]
Ectracts from the “World,” June, 1900.
DESPITE the unfavourable weather, Lady TIPTON's garden-party
on Wednesday was a great success. Strawberry-picking was the
º amusement, and some well-known performers were present.
iss DE MURE, as usual, beat all her rivals, but the Bishop of
PULB9Rough was only half-a-basket behind. Like most of her
friends, Lady TIPton has now converted all her croquet and tennis
lawns into fruit-beds.
LORD GRAYSox is entertaining a large y of friends for bird-
soaring this week. Starlings are somewhat scarce this year, but
sparrows "...# plentiful and strong on the wing. Some capital
sport, was enjoyed over these well-known fields last week, and the
host (who used a blunderbuss manufactured by Messrs. MURDEY) is
ited with having frightened away about 5000 brace in a single
ay.
. Trºra is quite wrong in stating that the Marquis of Coombe
intends to sell his well-known potato-patch in Hammersmith. On
the contrary, he has just laid down two dozen new plants." It is
true, however, that several of the smartest people are growing
onions instead of potatoes this year.
As the show-season will soon be with us again, it may be well to
remark that the committees should make certain of the genuine
character of the exhibits. It would be disgraceful were there to be
any repetition of such a scandal as occurred
any one of the compartments.

SoME of the papers have been making merry over the attempts to
start butter-making clubs among the poorer classes. It is true that
butter-making has been considered hitherto, almost exclusively a

allowed to amuse himself with this healthy pastime in the evening,
just as much as his superiors in social station.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“MR. SPEAKER!”
“Hats off, strangers!”—Policemen passim.
Now the new House of Commons is complete, and Members are
reparing to meet for their first Session, the question of who is to be

growing conviction in both political camps that there really is no
question on the subject. Had Mr. GULLY performed the duties of

Mr. Speaker Gully.
Speaker with , merely, average capacity, the House of Commons,
mindful of its highest traditions, would have been slow to celebrate
a party victory at the polls by dispossessing him in favour of a
nominee of the new majority. His marked success happily makes
such action more than ever improbable.
His position was made exceptionally difficult by the circumstances
of the day. Elected by a narrow majority, he succeeded the greatest
Speaker, of modern times. The fierce light that beats, on the
Speaker's chair was intensified by the inevitable contrast between
the new occupant and the stately figure long familiar to the House.
From the first Mr. GULLY wisely refrained from even approach to
imitation of the manner of Mr. PEEL. That was a thing apart, like
the bow of Ulysses. The new Speaker was simply himself; and the
House of Commons, the keenest, swiftest, fairest judge of character
in the world, was delighted to find in him perfect equanimity of
temper, a judicial mind, unfailing readiness in emergency, and a
quite surprising knowledge of the intricacies of procedure.
During his brief tenure of office Mr. GULLY was more than once
suddenly faced by a knotty point, that might reasonably have been
expected to baffle a 'prentice hand. Never on these occasions has he
failed. Such rare aptitude displayed at the outset of a career
promises the fullness of perfection when, strengthened and sus-
tained by the unanimous vote of a new Parliament, the Speaker
resumes his work.
New Work-Messrs. MACMILLAN have just published The
Theory and Practice ºf Counter-Irritation, by H. C. GILLIRs.
One example of this could easily be given by anyone in a hurry, who
couldn't get attended to at the Stores, or vice versá, by a counter-
jumper at a linendraper's, whose temper was more than ordinaril
{:}; some extra- y-shallying customer. -
OUR THESPIANS.
SIR HENRY IRying's Saturday night at home previous to his de-
parture for America was brilliant. House so crowded in every part,
that the like of it has rarely been seen even at the Lyceum. Our
ELLEN, as charming Nance Oldfield, was cheered to the Echo, or
would have been had there been any place left for Echo in the
house. Sir HENRY admirable as the old soldier in A Story of
Taterloo, and both he and Miss TERRY at their best in the one scene
from grand old WILLY SHAKSPEARE's Much Ado about Nothing.
The “Much Adoo,” as Mr. WELLER senior would have pronounced
and spelt it, came after the curtain had fallen, and on both sides the
“Adoo” was changed into a hearty “Au revoir.'" -
To mention “HENRY” is to remember “John NIE,” the Johnnie
yclept J. L.; Tool E, whom Mr. Punch was delighted to see, looking
“fit as a fiddle,” having Toole'd up to town from Margate evidently
on the high road to perfect recovery.
CONCERNING A PUBLIC NUISANCE.
By One who lives Next Door.
[The Salvationists of Warwickshire have lately been restrained by the
new county by-law, which provides that no person shall play any musical
instrument within fifty yards of a dwelling-house.]
BRAvo, good men of Warwick! you’d rejoice
John LEECH's soul and all whose nerves are shattered
By blatant street musician's raucous voice
Or braying trombone—these at last you’ve scattered
Ah! would that London followed now your lead,
And kept a tight hand o'er the rude fanatics
Who blare away her Sunda Peacº, whose creed
Is uproar, “fire and . and acrobatics'
If they’d a grain of humour's saving grace,
Enough to hear themselves as others hear them,
They’d straight retire to some far desert place
And bang and clang and howl where none come near them!
Ev’n as I write, some strain like “Daisy Bell”
With would-be sacred words and tuneless jar racks
My tortured ear—hard fate has made me dwell
Next door, alas! to what they call their “barracks.”
Their ranting, roaring may be heav'nly joys,
But me they fill with bile and ire plethoric;
When, I would ask, shall we put down such noise,
As have the worthy citizens of Warwick P
AU REVOIR, TO OPERA.
END of operatic season, and a fine season too. The PATTI mights
exceptionally brilliant. DE REszKE frères, the accomplished Bi-
cycling Brothers, did not appear, but Sir DRURIoDANUs sang the
old song “We’re going to do without them,” and did so, uncommonly
well, MAUREL, ANCONA, PLANÇon, were y
bright particular stars; while MELBA
suddenly shone forth as Comet with
magnificent tail, i.e. a great following.
CALvſ. held her own against all comers:
and, as Santuzza, it was a case of
“honours divided" with Mdme. BEL-
LINCIONI, who, it must not beforgotten,
was the original of the part. The
Beneficent BAUERMEISTER, of talent un-
limited, has shown that “woman,” like
man, “inher time can play many parts.”
Mlle. BAUERMEISTER has played them;
and all equally well.
So farewell Operatics till next year,
when DRURIolanus need fear no -
storms, if still provided with his light-
ning Conductors. BEVIGNANI, MAncINELLI & Co.. Nor need the
Liberal-Conservative DRURIoIANUs OPERATICUs think of having to
reckon with any formidable rivalry, should the utterly improbable
happen and a new Opposition Opera be started. Why two Opera
Houses cannot succeed in London may be a problem, but hitherto it is
oneof which dissolution of the weaker was the only solution. The strong
company went to Covent Garden, and the weak went—to the wall.

YoUNG PRIMROSE's PARTY.
A PLAINT OF THE Polls.
AIR-‘‘Hans Breitmann's Party,”
YoUNg PRIMRose had a Party,
He led it—like a lamb,
It fell in love with a motley thing
They called the Rad Pro-gramme.
They swore that plan to fight for,
Aye, fight till all was Blue;
But when it came unto the Polls,
That Party split in two.
Young PRIMRose had a Party,
For Progress it was bound;
But all the progress that it made
Was staggering round and round.
The liveliest shindies in the House,
And mockery out-o'-door,
Was all that Party caused, and so
It dwindled more and more.
Young PRIMRose had a Party.
I tell you it cost him dear.
The Rads he led “rolled into” him
Because he was a Peer:
They tried to knock Bung's spigot in,
The Caineites raised a cheer.
I think that so fine a Party
Never went bust on beer.
Young PRIMRose had a Party,
They were all “Souse undt Brouse,”"
A more divided company
Ne'er wrangled in the House:
They talked of “filling up the cup,”
Vetoing the Witler's guilt;
* “Saus und Braus”: Ger. Riot and bustle.
But soon they found the pot was full,
And that the cup was spilt.
Young PRIMRose had a Party,
Although it was not big,
It tried to break the power of beer,
And check the away. of wif
But soon they found 'twas all in vain,
The brewer they did “co
?? .
And the company it. like fighting
CrOWOIS
When the constable bids them stop.
Young PRIMRose had a Party,
Where is that Party now?
Where are the lovely golden dreams
Of the Newcastle pow-wow P
Where are the Democratic plans,
The L. C. C.’s delight?
All floated away on a flood of beer
Away—in the Ewigkeit!"
* “Ewigkeit”: Ger. Eternity; “gone for
ever.”
EAST Norfolk ELECTion.—When women
are stoned by cowardly ruffians, of any party,
or, more probably, of no party, it is not a time
for jokes. But Mr. Punch wishes he had
been there, with a few of his young men and
a few revolvers, and then some persons more
deserving to be hit might have been hit, and
with something sharper than stones. In East
Norfolk, during the excitement of an election,
it is evidently almost as necessary to carry
firearms for self-defence as in any quite un-
civilised and savage country—such as Bul-
aria, under the government of the brave
ERDINAND.
METEOROLOGICAL MISGIWINGS.
Saturday.—How warm it is Shall go for
my holiday somewhere on the sea. A month's
cruise on the coast of Norway, perhaps.
Sunday.—What a tremendous gale! Ima-
gine a month of this on the sea. Shall go
inland, quite in the country—say to a cottage
on Dartmoor.
Monday.—What a dull day !. Couldn't
stand the country in this gloom. Try Paris.
Tuesday.—A glorious day. Very hot and
sunny in Paris now. Shall go to the Lakes.
Wednesday.—Steady rain. Don't like the
idea of the Lakes. Always damp and de-
pressing. In this sort of weather better be
at Scarborough or Brighton. .
Thursday.-Drizzle and mist. No doubt
sea fog on coast. Hate sea fog. Better go to
a dry place abroad. How about North Italy P
Friday.—What beastly dust everywhere!
No good going to a dry, sunny climate. Try
Cornwall,
Saturday.--Damp, close day. Couldn't
stand much of this. Too enervating. . Shall
go to the Alps-anywhere up high in the
mountain air.
Sunday. — Chilly for the time of year.
Probably snowing on the Alps. Very dismal,
cowering over a stove in a Swiss inn., What
a difficulty this holiday is 1, Good, ideal
Will postpone it till the settled weather in
the winter.

With sound of heavy-sandalled feet
Wake awesome echoes in the street;

To halls of song or sit at gaze
In front of elevating plays;

With many a starry satellite.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
To recommend Lyre and Lancet to readers
of Punch is to preach to the converted, and,
as Sir WILLIAM HARCOURT said when he
opened his election campaign in Derby, that
is a work of supererogation. There is, how-
ever, this new thing to be said, that SMITH,
ELDER & Co., including the work in their
Novel Series, have presented it in dainty
form, and have preserved Mr. PARTRIDGE's
illustrations. My Baronite has read it through
again with increased admiration, for the
perilous audacity of the plot, the skill with
which it is worked out, and the many felici-
ties of the phrasing. It would be so easy to
spoil it by a coarse or slovenly touch. In no
scene of the breathless drama does Mr.
ANSTEY's hand forget its cunning.
The larger number of the verses that make
up the little volume SMITH, ELDER & Co.
É. under the title Tillers of the Sand
ave, Mr. Owen SEAMAN states in his preface,
tºº. in the National Observer. Whilst
they are above the average of the cleverness
of that really smart journal, they are tainted
by its besetting sin. Purporting to present
“a fitful record of the RoseBERY Adminis-
tration,” the recorder finds it all very bad.
This is hard on the late Government, but it
is harder still on the clever versifier. True
art requires light and shade, and here is
none. Appearing week by week the pungent
admixtures were passable, were even titilla-
ting. But the monotony of vituperation, how-
ever cleverly compounded, grows a little
wearisome, even in a volume that does not
much exceed a hundred ºft My Baronite
likes best “The Lament of the Macgregor,”
not because its literary style is more masterly
than that of its companion verse, but be-
cause, its fun is less acrid. The rest, with
significant exception of two pieces that ap-
peared in these pages, is too hotly spiced
with ASHMEAD-BARTLETTISM to please one
who looks to Mr. SEAMAN for the wine of
scholarly, verse and finds the vinegar of elec-
tion squibs. THE BARON DE B.-W.

THE LAST PAGE OF SOMEBODY'S DIARY.
(Picked up in the neighbourhood of Dorchester House )
BEFoRE leaving England I finish this book. I have seen much
and would have liked to see more. It was a great º
to me that the Polytechnic had changed its character. It was the
dream of my childhood to be present at a lecture “Illustrated with
brilliant experiments.” Still the British Museum was a very good
substitute. " Then I was *: with the Imperial Institute, and
appreciated SIRAUss's band. Although I have yet to learn what the
latter had to do with the spread of the British Dominion. And I was
delighted with the State Balls and the Ascot races. I was pleased, too,
with my visit to the Board School. And there seemed to be much
doing in the Houses of Parliament. But what struck we most of all
was the great prosperity I noticed everywhere. There is no poverty
in England. All is rich. Everyone is great. There are none who
are not powerful; it is marvellous, but true. I should like to
return to this great country to learn a little more. I have not yet seen
a paper printed; I have not dined at the table of those who are
responsible for the gaiety of nations. I have not watched the manu-
facture of a clock. I have not examined waxworks. I have not
risen in the air in a balloon, nor sunk below the level of the sea in a
diving-bell. But all this pleasure can wait till I pay England a
second visit. And I am pleased to find that certain places are myths,
the more especially as these places were said to be “disgraces to
civilization.” There is no East End. There are no prisons. Poverty
is a word that has become obsolete. Everyone is satisfied. A strike
never happens because all Englishmen are contented. This is the
lesson that I have learned at the hands of the great British Govern-
ment. It is strange, but undoubtedly true, that the English nation
has no “seamy side.” S3 I leave the country of prosperous content
with a salaam of heart-felt respect. And now for Paris, with its
wicked distractions. I hope I may survive. In the meanwhile

Really, dodging this storm of bludgeons is the most amusing occu-

Finally, I would willingly acknowledge all these little humours of
a contested election in a spirit of genial amiability had you not

GOOD NEWS, AND STRANGE TOO!
THE Northern Railway, Company of France, as the Daily
Telegraph informs us, has decided to spend four millions of francs
in improving its rolling-stock. This move ought to send up all its
“stock” in the market. Also there is to be a train of an entirely
new pattern, replete with every convenience, running in corre-
spondence with the London Chatham and Dover Company's most
convenient continental service. This is first-class (and second also)
news for persons about to travel. The D. T. further says that “the
adoption of bogies will make the running easy.” Good gracious !
The cutting and running would come quite naturally to most of the
passengers on beholding only one “bogey'; but when it comes to
"bogies,” there would be a general stampedel Very kind of the

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
I spoke last week of the General Election, more particularly with
| very delicate; WoRDsworth's mother had a character as peculiar as
that of her gifted son; RALEIGH said that he owed all his politeness
of deportment to his mother. There are other statements about other
regard to its influence on the speakers who take partin it. A treatise mothers, but those I have quoted may suffice in the meantime. What
on this aspect of the matter has yet to be written. One of the main
points to be determined will be the amount of influence exercised by
the speech, not on its hearers, but on the speaker himself.
Nothing is more remarkable than the rapidity and definiteness
with which a speaker's opinions crystallise during the course of a
speech. Let us assume, for example, that a Radical candidate has
been approached on the subject of an Eight Hours Bill, and, in order
to gain time, has promised to deal with it in his next speech, at the
same time giving an assurance of general -
sympathy. Probably he has not thought
much about the question before. In the
evening he will speak upon it; and sud-
denly, to his own intense surprise, he will
find himself declaring that legislation
will be vain, all social effort fruitless, until
the load of toil that presses on the mass of
his fellow-countrymen is lightened, and
a universal Eight Hours Bill is carried
through both Houses.
OR again, a Conservative is confronted
with the question of old-age pensions. Pre-
cisely the same process takes place, and
under the necessity of convincing himself,
while endeavouring to convince and to
please his audience, he will vow never to
cease his efforts in support of Mr. CHAMBER-
LAIN until a general system of State pen-
sions for the aged is established throughout
the United Kingdom.
So it is with votes of thanks and lauda-
tory speeches of all kinds. If you have to
move a vote of thanks to A., a politician
whom you do not specially admire, the odds
are about ten to one that you will describe him as a great statesman,
a profound thinker, an eloquent orator, and the man of the future.
All this may be due to your having embarked on a rhetorical period
which required more words than you had prepared #. to supply;
and in the agitation of filling up the gap, and rounding off the period,
you say what you had not the remotest intention of saying when you
got on to your legs. Hence come in after years parallel columns, and
aggravating charges of inconsistency.
Sir William cultivates
It was roses, roses all the way. But that was some time ago in
the case of Mr. Isaac Hoyle, late Liberal Member for the Heywood
Division of Lancashire. He was asked to support Mr. SNAPE the
Liberal Candidate at this election, but he refused to “take any part
in sending Mr. SNAPE to Parliament, charged with duties for which,
as I think, his votes show he has no qualification.”. The receipt
of this letter caused the greatest excitement in the Division,
and at the Heywood Reform Club Mr. HoyLE's portrait has
been smashed, to pieces and thrown out of the building. It is
stated also that his subscriptions are being returned. Clearly a case
of adding Hoyle to the flames of controversy.
MR. THOMAS MILVAIN, the Conservative who vainly endeavoured to
oust Sir WILFRID LAwson from the Cockermouth Division, was once
a great boxer—a heavy-weight champion amongst amateurs, if my
memory serves me... In the course of his late contest he addressed a
hostile meeting at Dearham. Many questions were put to him. One
was, “What weight was ta when thoo was a boxer?” Mr.
MILVAIN's answer was, “I was 13 st. 8 lb. That was twenty-eight
years ago, and I have not had the gloves on since.” (Laughter and
cheers, and a Voice: “Would you like to have them on now 2°) “I
am quite prepared to give any of you a turn, if you want one.”
(Great laughter and cheers.)
WHEN a Candidate, heckled by enemies, finds
All his efforts to keep the place still vain,
Let him try one resource ere he pulls down the blinds,
And conform to the model of MILVAIN.
For when politics palled he referred to the years
When his skill as a boxer was lauded;
An allusion to gloves won him laughter and cheers,
Which was more than the “point of his jaw.” did.
IN a provincial contemporary I find the following startling infor-
mation, under the heading, “Mothers of Great Men.” Schum ANN's
I want to know is Yº... reasonable human being should care, or
be supposed to care, about these ridiculous scraps of information col-
lected from a rubbish-heap of useless knowledge. Here is another
that I cannot leave out: HAYDN dedicated one of his most important
instrumental compositions to his mother. Amazing.
In the parish of Swaffham Bulbeck (Phoebus, what a name !), there
are apparently two bridges. At the adjourned quarterly meeting of
the Parish Council the other day, Mr. C. P. Fyson in the chair, “it
was reported that Bridge. No. 1 required to
be re-built. . . . The Chairman repo
Bridge No. 2 required the same treatment,
and eventually the whole matter was ad-
journed”—presumably, in the hope that in
the interval the bridges would rebuild
themselves.
HOW I LOST MY POLL.
- MR. PUNCH, HonourED SIR,-By way of
| supplementing efforts of Daily Chroncile to
obtain authorised statements showing cause
for defeat of certain distinguished candi-
dates, have secured following satisfactory
explanations, for authenticity of which I
have .#: in vouching. Have su
pressed names of men and places, thus sacri-
ficing verisimilitude on altar of discretion.
A. explains:–Opponent started with every
natural advantage, having only appeared in
constituency three weeks and two days ago,
and being entirely unknown. (Omne igno-
tum pro benefico.) I, on other hand, had
been on spot for five-and-twenty years, and
was only two well known.
— B. explains:—Attribute my defeat (by
exactly, 4529 votes) to over-confidence on P. of my supporters.
Seems that recollection of ample, margin of two (one voting-paper
disputed) by which I was returned to late Parliament produced reck-
less and culpable apathy.
C. explains:—Mistake to suppose that Local or any other Veto had
appreciable bearing on result of election. Fact is that opposition
chartered every available traction-engine to bring up rural electorate.
All other traffic practically suspended. Terrorised owners refused to
risk their stables in unequal struggle. Was reduced to average of one
horse a piece for my four-in-hands. Also other man's wife prettier
than mine.
D. explains:–Am author of many standard works of blood-curdling
adventure, largely among blacks. Found myself besieged one day in
headquarters by what I took to be murderous contingent of enemy.
In all my books of fiction, hero would have hacked his way through
midst, if only with open penknife. . Stern reality quite a different
matter. Fell back upon services of local fire-brigade. Turned out
afterwards that crowd actually consisted of admiring readers and
political friends all eager to draw me, by pardonable ruse, into display
of heroic qualities as depicted in my popular writings. Disillusioned
% me, and damped by fire-brigade, mob went off and voted for other
slole
the “Celtic Fringe.”
E. explains:–Had Women's Suffrage existed, am confident should
have been returned by handsome majority, being single and bit of an
Adonis. . As it was, fatal gift for attracting feminine attention
alienated ºf male electors. Other candidate solid family man
without physical charm. Has been said that beauty is a curse. In
own case must unhesitatingly admit soft impeachment.
F. explains:—It arose in this way. Had arranged beforehand
that pole of carriage should snap in two during ascent of heavy
incline in very heart of borough, idea being that partisans would be
compelled to un-horse vehicle and Hºly propel it along in semi-
triumphal progress. All went well till it came to pushing. Then
was seen that weight of fellow-passengers (three obese stump-orators
sent down by Caucus) overtaxed strength of small body, of sup-
º men remarkable for intellectual perspicuity rather than
rute force. . Notwithstanding laudable efforts, carriage, receded
slowly at first, then, gaining impetus, rushed with incredible d
full into flººr window of MAYor's grocery-store. Self and all
three orators bled º: Should add that MAYok was ex-
ceedingly popular politician of heterodox views. Cause of my Party
completely ruined by shocking fiasco.
Kindly observe, dear Mr. Punch, how insignificant a part seems
to have been played in above elections by great and vital questions of
day. Let me hear if you want any more of these explanations. Cost
mother was gifted in music; ChopIN's mother, like himself, was
me nothing. Yours, SPLENDIDE MENDAx.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI) 61
A PSALM OF AUGUST.
(For the Circular Tourist.)
TELL me not, in Summer numbers,
“Holidays are but a dream : ”
If you hold that vacs are slumbers,
Well—things are not what they seem.
Cook is reall GAze is earnest!
And the earth's end is their goal;
“Bust” thou art, and “bust” returnes',
Sing they to the tripper's soul.
Not enjoyment—rather, sorrow
Greets the tourist on his way; -
His to toil, that each to-morrow
Find him farther on his way.
Tours are long, and Time is fleeting,
While we dire discomfort brave;
In globe-trotting, record-beating,
Pleasure surely finds its grave.
Let us, still, each town be “doing,”
Since “tow-rowing” is our fate—
Then, half-dead with guide-pursuing,
Brag o'er those at home who wait!
“Forwood Boys.”—Sir ARTHUR Foawoon,
the new Baronet, observes the Day-by-Day-
istical writer in the Daily Telegraph, “is not
to be confounded with his brother, Sir WILLIAM
Forwood.” Why not? Why interfere with
the liberty of speech on the part of some
Radicals, who might say “Confound, 'em
both !” Or, in the words of the National
Anthem, “Confound their politics.”
OMITTED FROM THE GRACIOUs SPEECH OF
H.R.H. The PRINCE OF WALEs AT THE open-
ING OF THE SOUTHAMPTON NEw DOCK.—“I
appear here as the Judge, at whose word the
prisoner is to be let into the dock, and, sub-
sequently, let out again. Ladies and gentle-
men, the prisoner is-the water.” (Cheers.)
SCRAPS FROM CHAPS.
A DIVIDEND DESERVED.—The Glasgow Town Council has been
running its own tram-cars for a year past, and has cleared more than
£20,000 of profit for the citizens out of the business, . There is huge
rejoicing on the Clyde, and no wonder, as the result is due to sheer
ood management, without over-charging the public or over-driving
the drivers. The Tramways Committee reports:—
Further, the Committee have given effect to what they believe to be the
general feeling of the citizens—viz., that the cars, which necessarily form a
notable feature of the streets of the city, should not only be tasteful in
design and colour, and comfortable for passengers, but also that their
general appearance should not be marred or #. destinations obscured
by advertisements.
Moral for many southern railway, tram, and omnibus companies—
Go and do likewise! Moral for Glasgow citizens—Get carried over
your tram-lines often enough, and you’ll carry over a big dividend
to decrease your next year's rates!
SUB-LIME!—This is how “business” is transacted by some of the
Youghal Town. Commissioners. The question was—who should
supply them with lime !
Mr. Kennedy. I propose that thirty-nine barrels be bought and paid for.
Mr. Loughlan. I propose that he supply the lime at 1s. per barrel.
Mr. Long &º I say the Board can't do anything of the kind.
Mr. Loughlan. You'll get choked if you don't keep cool (laughter).
Mr. Long (ercitedly). Take care of your windpipe (laughter). I suppose
he gave you a few gocá lumps of lime (loud laughter).
Mr. Loughlan (jumping up excitedly). Now that is a gross insult.
The Chairman. Order, order, gentlemen.
Then Youghal's worried chairman raised a cry of “Order!”—when
A lump of old white limestone took him in the abdomen;
And he smiled a wan official smile and walked out at the door,
And the tongues of LoNG and Lough LAN interested him no more.
PoRKERS AND PAUPERS.-Bath Workhouse pigs “live on the best
of good cheer” in the form and substance of # , so the municipal
pork and rate-aided bacon ought to be prime. The Bristol Mercury
reports a meeting of the Bath guardians, when

JOEYING AT THE PRINCE OF WALES’.S.
THERE have been Joes not a few on the

GRIMALDI, we }}. on the way Joseph An-
drews, Poll and Partner Joe, Poor Joe from
Bleak House, and many other JoEs until we

ful Phyllis BRoughton—of whom Gentle-

the pretty-voiced LETTIE SEARLE, helped by

Life below Stairs and ending anyhow, offer-

ARTHUR for introducing into it any amount of
“divarsion” in the wayof new songs, eccentric
speeches, nods, winks, becks, and wreathed
smiles, may be continuing its successful career
in the summer of '96, there being no apparent
reason why its run should ever stop, that is
as long as Gentleman, Arthur Joe Roberts
handles the ribands as the popular Cabbing-it
Minister.
A NEw TITLE.-Our GRACE, the cricketer,
is not made a “Sir” or raised to a dukedom.
There is, however, in view of present craze, a
great chance for conferring the greater honour
on a champion bicyclist. His title would be
“The Duke of WHEELINGTON.”
Mr. MANCHIP called attention to the fact that some of the children did
not even touch their milk gruel and dry bread which was served out for
breakfast. On Friday morning when the visitors were at the Workhouse at
seven o’clock two buckets of milk gruel were taken out to the pigs. Mr.
MANchup proposed that the Medical Officer be asked if he would be good
enough at his earliest convenience to consider whether a change could be
made in the children's diet. The Chairman thought if the gruel was
sweetened with a spoonful of treacle the children would then like it. It was
agreed to give the Chairman's suggestion a fortnight's trial.
Congratulations to the Bath children on being e-manchip-ated
from their old diet !
For securing “absolute impartiality” in conferring the prizes at
the Llanelly National Eisteddfod, the judges had “a pit dug for
them,” into which they disappeared during the progress of com-
petitions, so that participators could not “fix them with a glittering
eye,” and compel them (by hypnotic means), to award a prize. Sir
Joseph BARNEY — warbling, sotto roce, “This is my time for
isappearing”—greatly enjoyed these dives to the bottom of the
well in search of Truth, and no doubt the novel departure “assisted”
the blindness of Justice. But, so far as dignity is coxcerned, “Oh I
the pit-y of it.”
WE read of a cooky at Claughton,
In music she was a self-taught’un ;
But her mistress, I fear,
Said 'twas nothing but beer
that caused her cook to vociferate hymns and, in her harmonious
enthusiasm, to return home towards midnight and hammer loudly at
the door. e know not whether this melodious cuisinière's recipe
for cleaning fire-irons “with a wet rag and a bucket of water” is to
be found in Mrs. GLAsse's Art of Cookery, but the learned Judge
decided in favour of the mistress, against whom MARY Rogers (a
poetical name forsooth) brought an action for unjustifiable dismissal,
Alas! poor cook. She must, henceforward, do her stewing without
singing and her “mashes” without melody.
WHEN Mr. HENRY McCALMonT gives “receptions” they will be
styled, not “soirées,” but “After-Newnes.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE POLITICAL UGLY DUCKLING.
(Fragments of a Brummagem Fairy Tale.)
It was in a big town in the Midlands that the Ugly Duckling
first chipped shell. “Cheek / Cheek / | Cheek /* squeaked the
youngster...as he crept out. How big and ugly he was, to be sure!
Not a º: like the other ducklings. In fact he was a portent, and
8. DuZZie,
owever, the ugly, grey-coated youngster, took to the water, and
swam about like the rest. “He’s every inch my own child, after
all,” said the old duck. “And really he’s very º when one
comes to look at him attentively. Quack! quack!” added she;
“now, come along, and I’ll take you into high society. Now move
on, and mind you cackle º; and bow your head before that
old duck yonder, who is the noblest born of them all. Now bend
your neck, and say " Quack!’”
But the Ugly Duckling was an odd bird, as well as an ill-favoured
one, and gave much trouble and excited much jealousy in the duck-
y He quacked indeed, but he would not bend his head or bow
to the old duck º -
“He remained ſºns in the egg-shell,” mused the maternal
bird; “and therefore his figure, like his manners, is not properly
formed on the true duck model. But as he's a male duck it won’t
matter so much. I think he’ll prove strong, and be able to fight his
way through the woºl .” which Was true. - -
..But at first the Ugly Duckling had a baddish time of it. He was
bitten, pushed about, and made game of, not only, by the ducks
but by the hens. They all declared he was much too big, an
fancied himself too much. He certainly was not graceful, and he
had a cocky, self-assertive air which irritated the Conservative Old
Cockalorums. He was always making unexpected and unducklike
sorties, “alarums and excursions,” and lifting up his raucus-caucus
voice against the time-honoured rules and respectable conventions of
the duck-pond. So much so, that they nicknamed him the “Daring
Duckling,” and prophesied that he would come to a bad end.
So he ran away, and flew over the palings. -
He had many adventures, and various. . He dwelt for a time with
a lot of wild ducks in a marsh, and even struck up a sort of friend-
ship for a swarm of wild geese, who wanted to do away with domesti-
cation and destroy the “tame villatic” tendencies of gregarious
goosedom, and abolish barn-yards and duck-ponds, peacocks, and
game-fowls, and guinea-hens, and poulterer's shops, and pâté de foie
gras, and other checks on liberty and incentives to .."; But
somehow he didn't get on with the wild ducks for long. He was
so much wilder than they, and wanted his own way too much and
too often for the old and recognised leaders of their flocks. And as to
the wild geese, why he soon lost º with their º:
programmes” and “subversive schemes,” which he learned to regar
indeed as a sort of wild goose chase, and deride and denounce as
vehemently as he had aforetime praised them.
“I think I'll take my chance, and go abroad into the wide world,”
said the Duckling. - - - - -
One evening, just as the sun was setting, there came a whole
flock of beautiful large birds from a grove. The Ugly Duckling had
never seen any so lovely before. They were dazzlingly white, with
long graceful necks: they were swans. They uttered a peculiar cry,
and then spread their magnificent wings and away they flew from
this cold country to warmer lands across the open sea, as was their
usual custom. They rose so high that the Ugly Duckling felt a
strange sensation come over him, a sort of delicious vertigo. He
turned round and round in the water like a wheel, stretched his neck
up into the air toward, them, and uttered so loud and strange a cry
that he was frightened at it himself. Oh! never could he again
forget those beautiful, happy birds, so gracefully fleeting against a
primrose, sky. He knew not how, those birds were called, nor
whither they were bound, but he felt an affection for them, such as
he had never }. experienced for any living creature. And he more
and more lost love for, and patience with, all his old associates, ducks
or geese, wild Or domesticated. º :- -
The Ugly Duckling now felt able to flap his wings. They rustled
much louder than before, and bore him away most sturdily; and
before long he found himself in a noble park, a nobleman's park;
indeed, the dainty demesne of one of those who “toil not neither do
they spin.” It was quite Beaconsfieldian in its beauty, with its
smooth emerald sward and umbrageous elm-avenues, its dusky
cedar clumps and tail-spreading, crest-sunning peacocks.
“Dear me!” mused the Ugly Duckling, “It is strange, but I
feel quite at home here 2 / /?”
Three magnificent white swans now emerged from, the thicket
before him; they flapped their wings and then swam lightly on the
surface of the water. The larger one (whose beak bore the letter S
as a “nick”) was dark and haughty of mien, the second, (whose beak
was branded B) was slim and jº; whilst the third,
8. i.lº; even rather sullen-looking bird, was beak-stamped with
a leg 1016 D.
“I will fly towards these royal birds,” cried the Ugly, Duckling.
And he flew into the water, and swam towards those stately swans,
who turned to meet him with sail-like wings the moment they saw
him.
º Why, he is one of us!” said the darker and statelier of the
three. “Almost l” he added, sotto voce. -
The Ugly Duckling was startled at the remark. , But, looking at
his reflection in the smooth lake he was more startled, still. His own
image was to his eyes no longer that of the Daring Duckling, much
less of the Ugly One. It was smart, smooth, sleek, swelling, in fact
swan-like!!! At any rate, he thought so, and so, indeed, the other
three swans seemed to think. -
He preened his feathers, and puffed forth his plumes.,. He º
his wings, and arched his neck, as he cried in the fullness of hi
heart:—
“Iºnever dreamed of such happiness when I was the Brummagem
Ugly Duckling.” * - * +
It matters not being born in a duck-yard if one is hatched from a
swan's egg
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Iw Leisure Time, by W. S. MAyob (ELLIOT STOCK) is, so my
Baronite reports, a daintily-bound little volume of blameless verse,
unambitious, as may be inferred -
from its title. The author writes
like a classical scholar, his lines are
fluent and melodious, his metre and
rhyme unimpeachable, while some of
the poems, such as “Zaleucus” and
“A Vision,” rise distinctly above the
general level. In others, there are ºf
passages which my Baronite—a sadly 4%
prosaic and matter-of-fact person—
owns to havingfound slightly obscure.
For example, in the following
couplet:—
“In vain the fickle demon sports
With fetid remnants of decay.”
He º: failed t#: º: w;
articular—or rather anything - -
†† is referred to, or why he should amuse himself in
so eccentric and unpleasant a manner. ..
Nor, my Baronite says, was his conception of contentment greatly
assisted by this somewhat complicated comparison:-
“Contentment is a love-commissioned barque
Sailing a self-less sea—a sea whose flood
Is ordered alway by the laughing guns
Of Virtue's fortalice, whose armament.
Primed with rose-petal powder, doth discharge
In generous rounds of sympathy, with all,
Scattering happiness, whose smile betrays
The pangless hurt.”
But that, he is quite willing to admit, may be rather the fault, of
his own imagination, than the poet's. Again, in a poem entitled
“Love's Messengers,” the author writes:-
“Flit thou along on softly feathered feet,
Noiseless, thou shadowy-pinioned minister,
And gently fan, with midnight gale, my sweet,
Lest thou awaken her.”
Which, to my Baronite, suggests the difficulty that, if the, minister
fans the lady with his shadowy Piniºns, “gently,” he will fail to
g a “
hing resemblin midnight gale”; on the other
produce anything res unkah so energetically as
hand, if he performs the part of invisible - -
to suggest *. he .. help awakening her, unless, she is a
very #. eeper indeed—and might give her a cold in the head.
Šurely this is rather an unfair dilemma on which to place a feathered
minister of any denomination. - - -
But after all, poetry, as my Baronite fully recognises, is nºt
meant to be jś so literal a standard, and it may be cheerfully
conceded that there are many people who make a less profitable use
of their "Leisure Time” than Mr. MAvoR has done. In which opinion

THE LAST KNIGHT OF THE SEASON.
On Monday, July 29, Sir Aggustus. HARRIs, bidding fare-
well to a typical '95 Covent Garden audience (house crowded in
every part), seized the opportunity. to present one of his lightning con-
ductors with a “báton of honour.” In a spontaneous speech, DRURio-
LANUs declared that Signor MANCINELLI had “worked like a Trojan,”
and the announcement was received with sympathetic applause.
Still, it was thought possible by those present that the pleasant and
prosperous impresario was in search of something that he had seem-
ingly lost—“a little poem of his own.”. We have no hesitation in
publishing the following lines, entitled Sans Adieu, found in the
jºhjof the dºg orchestra. If they are not from the pen
of DRURIolanus, they ought to have been:-

(Notes for an Additional Chapter to the

THE Deputation did their very best. They
were most anxious to make thirgs smooth.
“He whom they desired to obey” would wear
an inferior sort of crown, robes of cotton-
backed velvet, trimmed with imitation fur.
He would not give away orders—he would
only take them. He *. not command the
army, save as an agent acting under direc-
tion from the Master. There is nothing he
would not do to secure the goodwill of his
great, his benevolent, his all-powerful Master.
The Bear was very amiable. The Bear was
pleased with the Deputation and with the
nation they represented. And having said this,
there was nothing further for the Bear to say.
“But, most powerful of powers, most
clement of sovereignties,” urged the Deputa-
tion, “there is another matter, needing
decision. How about the Prince P’’
“What Prince P’’ softly murmured the
Bear, in a tone of curiosity combined with
astonishment.
“The Prince we wish to serve,” explained
the Deputation; “the Prince who desires to
serve you.” -
“Have you read the Treaty of Berlin "
asked Bruin. “It is a most excellent agree-
ment, and deserves special attention. Does
the name of any Prince appear therein ''
“No,” replied the Deputation; ... and the
same painful omission is observable in the
Almanac de Gotha. So we would petition
on our knees that the painful omission should
be supplied. We ask that the Prince —”
“Stop! stop 1" cried the Bear. “You are
talking of a myth. As Mrs. GAMP-a well-
known Englishwoman – once observed, ‘I
don't believe there ain't no sech person.” So
think I, and so thinks the Treaty of
Berlin.”
And so the Deputation returned from whence
they came, and “the Prince” continued to
“take the waters” without obtaining the
cure he desired. It was ºft.* to His
Highness, but not to the Editor of the
Almanac de Gotha, who found a revised
edition of his excellent periodical was, at
least for the present, unnecessary.

PUNCH,
PASSION AND POETRY.
I was immensely struck, a few days ago,
by a passage in a h recently delivered
by the Archbishop of CANTERBURY, in which
he explained his method of dispelling those
passing fits of ill-temper from which, alas !
not even Archbishops are wholly free. “At
times,” so ran the report of His Grace's
words, “anger or irritation came upon him,
but on the table he kept a book of pleasant
poems, of which he would read a few lines,
and the irritation would melt away.” Imme-
diately I determined to follow this º:
example. It was unfortunate that the “
of pleasant poems” was not described more
*::::::". it be the verses of Mr.
RTHUR CHRISTOPHER BENSON ?—but I
bought a pocket volume of Selections{... the
Great Poets, which contained enough variety
to suit every case, and then looked out for an
opportunity of trying the Archbishop's plan.
I had not long to wait. That very evening
I came across my uncle Robert at Clapham
Junction, in a furious ºft. at having just
missed the last train to Slowborough, where
he lives. At once I produced my volume.
and in slow and emphatic accents I read
aloud some three or four hundred lines from
“Paradise Lost.” I was about to add one or
two of WoRDsworth's sonnents, when I
realised that my uncle had long since dis-
appeared, and that I was surrounded by a
jeering crowd, who evidently supposed me
to be a member of the Salvation Army.
On the following morning I received a
visit from SNIPs, my tailor. He was im-
polite enough to suggest a settlement of what
he termed my “small account,” a demand,
as I politely but plainly assured him, which
was altogether absurd. As he showed distinct
symptoms of irritation at this juncture, I
an to read him a scene from Measure for
easure. Strangely enough, this seemed
only to irritate him further, and I understand
that he intends to take proceedings against
me in the County Court. This second un-
accountable failure of the Archbishop's remedy
greatly surprised and pained me, but I de-
cided to give it another trial.
This morning I was playing golf with my
friend MACFoozle. At no time askilful golfer,
MACFoozle's form to-day was worse than
ever; whenever he made a bad stroke—and
he seldom made a good one—he indulged in
the most violent language. Fortunately my
yolume of poetry was in my pocket. When
he completely missed his drive at the second
hole, I . him Col.FRIDGE's Dejection.
When he broke his mashie at the fourth, I
treated him with copious selections from In
Memoriam, Finally, he got badly bunkered
while playing to the fourteenth hole. For
some minutes he smote furiously with
his niblick, only raising prodigious clouds of
sand as the result of his efforts. This was
clearly a golden opportunity for the Arch-
bishop's cure, “anger and irritation” but
faintly represented MACFoozle's rage. Seat-
ing myself on the edge of the bunker, I
began to read aloud. The Ring and the Book
with the utmost pathos. Over what followed
I prefer to draw a veil It is enough to say
that a niblick is a very effective weapon, and
that I write these lines in bed.
When I recover, I really must call at
Lambeth for fuller directions. The archie-
piscopal remedy for angry passions does not
seem invariably happy in its results, as far
as my experience goes.

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
In a biographical sketch of the late Rev. Dr. Julius HAwley
SEELYE, formerly President of Amberst College, in America, I read
that “Amherst made him President notwithstanding considerable
opposition in the faculty. He soon overcame that, and advanced the
prosperity of the College in the acces-
sions, to its faculty and endowments
that he secured. He soon required the
students to sign an agreement to be
gentlemen. A violation of the pledge
resulted in the termination of their
careers at Amherst.” This sounds
strange, for it would appear that if no
pledge had been given the students
might have behaved as they liked,
without º their careers. The
º , idea of solemnly pledging yourself to
Lº be a gentleman is quite colossal.
-- THE Independent. Labour Party, is
- - - not dead yet. It is forming clubs,
just like any ordinary humdrum party. The Western Daily
Press reports that “At a special meeting held at LEE's Coffee
Tavern, Bath Bridge, last night, when there were present Mr. W. S.
M. KNIGHT, president of the Bristol South Independent Labour
Party (in the chair), Messrs. A. BRowne, E. B. HACK, C. WALE, Q.
F. BROCKLEHURST, T. Pole, C. PARKER, and W. PRICE, it was unani-
mously decided to open a club for Totterdown and the East Ward of
Bedminster in connection with the Independent Labour Party.
Officers and a committee were appºinted, and suitable headquarters
for the club were decided upon.” Nothing could be more º.
Totterdown suggests decrepitude and failure º this case at least),
and Bedminster hints at repose and peace. I offer the suggestion
and the hint gratis to the Independent Labour Windbags.
TRE Loveday, Street Canal Bridge (which is, Ifancy, in Birming-
ham) is evidently a demon bridge with a depraved taste for injuring
children, One day last week it threw John Chick, aged seven, off
and broke one of his legs. About five hours later, resenting an
attempt on the part of THoMAs WALTon, aged twelve, to climbit, it
flung, him of on to the towing-path and injured his back. A few
days before that it had precipitated the same THoMAs WALTON into
the water, whence he was rescued with some difficulty. Evidently
this is a bridge with an ungovernable temper, and the authorities
should guard it efficiently.
THE Scotsman informs me that “speaking the other day at
Haddington, Mr. BALFOUR glanced scathingly at those politicians of
the baser sort who seek to confuse great issues by dragging to the
front petty or irrelevant questions, and the breath of whose nostrils
is the disturbance of the harmony which should subsist between
class and class of the community.” On this two questions arise.
The first is how Mr. BALFouB, an amiable gentleman, managed to
glance scathingly. To scath, as I learn from the dictionary, means
to hurt, to injure; and, personally, I cannot imagine Mr. BALFour
infusing very much venom into a mere glance of his expressive eye.
The second question is how politicians, even of the baser sort, can
go on living when their unfortunate lungs are filled with a disturb-
ance of harmony. That they should have sufficient strength left to
drag to the front petty or irrelevant questions is nothing short of a
marvel, due allowance being made for metaphors.
A golfer is in trouble, and has confided his difficulties to Golf.
Whilst playing on the links at Streetly, on July 16, he drove a ball, which
apparently fell clear, but which for some time could not be found. After
some little hunting it was discovered under a small tuft of heather in a lark's
nest, resting on the back of a young lark, apparently about four days old,
tºgether with three lark's eggs, which were quite intact. The golfer was
obliged, of course, to lift the ball and place it behind, as it would have been
gross cruelty to have played it from the nest. It was match Plº, Under
the exceptional circumstances was he bound to lose the hole? The editor
replies that if a player were a stickler for the law and nothing but the law,
he, of course, would be entitled to enforce it against his opponent who found
the ball in the nest.
A TEB for your ball, you may fashion of sand
(Which is found in the sugar you use for your tea);
Then you spread your legs wide, and you º: a firm stand,
And away with a whack goes the ball flying free.
If it flies like a bird, there’s no need to explain;
If not, then the ways of that golfer are dark,
Who attempts, though the effort is doomed to be vain,
To stand, taking tee on the back of a lark.
There has been some excitement at Weston-super-Mare. The
Conservative party organized a reception for the Hon. G. H.
Jø14.1FFF on his first appearance in the town since his election for the
Wells division. Arrangements were made for those intending to take
art in the procession to meet the hon, gentleman at the Potteries on
is return from Banwell Horse Show at 7 p.m., but he arrived in the
town a quarter of an hour too early, and scores of enthusiasts were
disappointed. Those, however, who happened to be early enough
followed the hon. gentleman, some on foot and others in cabs, to the
Royal Hotel, the Town Band heading the procession. Mr. Jolliffe
rode on a coach drawn by four horses, and was supported by several
of the leaders of the party in the town. Subsequently he addressed
those assembled.” But if Mr. Jolliffe rode on a coach, why was it
necessary to support him P Moreover, º: that it was a four-
horse affair, it seems unjust that the leaders should be talked of and
that no mention at all should be made of the wheelers.
NANA SAHIB has died once more.
A Mr. WILLIAM BRowN, who was formerly an officer in the East India
Company's service, and is now residing at San Francisco, gives the follow-
ing particulars regarding the fate of NANA, SAHIB.. Mr. BRown says that
he was commodore of the Ganges Fleet in the Indian Mutiny, and was
attacked by Sepoys under NANA SAHIB himself, who was shot in the fight-
ing, and afterwards died on board Mr. BRowN's ship. , NANA SAHIB's body
was then cremated, and the ashes were committed to the river.
Why, oh why, has Mr. BRowN, whom I heartily congratulate on
clearing up the mystery, kept silence for nearly forty years? And,
by the way, which Mr. WILLIAM BRowN is he? There must be a
good º WILLIAM BRowN's even in San Francisco, Before con-
cluding that the matter is definitely settled, I should like to hear
Mr. HENRY SMITH, Mr. Richard Robinson, and Mr. John Jones
on the subject.

A QUERY. JOWE'S JESTER INTERVIEWED.
(By Omar Khayyam.)
[“WANTED.—An Up and Down GIRL; aged 16; English; strong.”
—Advertisement in “Times,” August 7.]
TELL me, mysterious maiden, when and whence
And where and wherefore and on what pretence
You're “up-and-down” — this
riddle rede, I pray,
And rid my bosom of a care immense!
Does “up” mean sky-high, “down,”
upon the ground?
! Is 't on a see-saw that you bob and
bound?
There's more in this than meets
the eye, I fear—
I cannot rest until the clue be found.
Are you a damsel, too, that's in-and-
about P
YoºHºº be all at once for aught
ow,
For all I know is clouded o'er with
doubt.
Pray, have {. golden hair all down
- your back
A-hanging? Is there something that you lack
To play with, love, adore—as, say, a bike
Whereon to travel up and down a track?
What though I’ve never met you in the throng,
I’m glad you're English-born, sixteen, and strong;
Life has its ups and downs (more downs than ups),
But you're a new sort—hence this idle song !
(A Page of Mythology written up to Date)
THE Traveller from the Earth left his balloon and trod the cloud
that seemed prepared to receive him. As he did this there was a
peal of laughter which echoed far and wide.
“Where am I?” asked the explorer in English, for he was
British-born.
“You have come to the head-quarters of waggery,” returned
the Resident, recovering from a violent fit of merriment. “We
are never dull here, we have so much to amuse us.”
“Indeed! And how is that?” -
“Why, I take a delight in effecting the
most comical transformations imaginable.
By the simplest means I can cause an in- |
habitant of the Earth to change his costume ""
five times in as many hours. The jest, is |
provocative of limitless mirth, especially \
amongst the doctors and the undertakers.” -
“And what are the simplest means?” º
“Why, I will serve up on Monday a sun Wº:
worthy of the most fiery day in an unusually WN.º.
sultry August. On Tuesday I will send a ſºº
gale and hailstones, suggestive of the arctic -
regions at Yule-tide. On Wednesday I will - -
resume the oppressive heat until streams dry up, and water rises to
a premium. #. on Thursday I will cover the ground with snow,
and finish up the week with a deluge.”
The Stranger raised his hat and answered, “The Clerk of the
Weather, I presume?”
“Quite so,” was the immediate response. “And now you must
leave me to my work, or Englishmen will have nothing to talk about.”
And the tº: once more continued its progress amidst a perfect
salad of the elements.
*Very amusing,” thought the Traveller, and then he added aloud,
speaking incidentally, the opinion of all his countrymen, “but dis-
tinctly inconvenient!”

BY OUR NOTES-AND-QUERY-MAN.
Mem. for the new: Historian of England.
It is probable, from recent discoveries, in the Archives of the
State Paper Office, that immediately after the time of CRANMER, in
consequence of his having recanted two or three times, the See of
Canterbury was to have been re-named “The See of Reganterbury;”
Also the question as to the origin of the name is, we believe, finally
settled by the fact having come to light, that, every Archbishop, in
consequence of the extent of his diocese and the necessity of his
taking exercise, was compelled to be (as was Dr. TAIT, and as is the
present Archbishop, Dr. BENsoN) an excellent equestrian, and that
the favourite pace for proceeding comfortably and expeditiously was
“a canter.” The origin of the “bury” has yet to be accounted
for, as it has been spelt at various times “bery,” “berry,” “berie,”
“burrie,” “bury.” But Kent being an hop county, and beer, the
popular beverage from time immemorial, it is highly probable that
as “canter” referred to the horse, so “bery” (with the “e” long
‘‘ beery”) referred to the refreshment for man (not for beast) required
during the journey. This is from an antiquarian point of view most
interesting.
“THE Cowes WEEK.”—This, read out aloud to a dairyman and a
butcher, sounds bad; as the first would be anxious as to the milk,
and the second as to the veal: for he would argue, “If the cow's
weak, what'll the calf be?”

As I don't. And moresomever it do make me faint and queer ...
When I think of Hengland's 'Ope aboard that skittish, sloping thing,
As looks to * shore-going eyes like a white bird all wing.
Well, Iown. I’m not a Wiking; all I want of the blue sea
Is a kipper for my breakfust, and a winkle with my tea.
But the Guv'nor, he’s a topper at the nortickle. Great Scott!

He's a puffeck pocket Neptune, wich a chubby little chap,
Looks perticularly fetchin' in a trotty yotting cap.
Then he loves the swells—like I do—and it’s sweet to 'ear him tork
Qf his pal the P. of W. and his chum the Dook o' York.
He's just like a locomotive on the everlastin' puff,
He enjys hisself like fifty, and he's never 'ad enuff:
I do like to 'ear him patter to the º ashore,
He keeps his friends a-bustin', and the table in a roar.
I only wish, dear MARY, I could phonygraff his chat,
And kinettyscope his haction; you would roar all round your 'at.
The Cowes Week would 'ave been rippin’ if it 'adn't bin for rain;–

And them tuppenny-apenny “trippers,” as did ought tº be kep out

The Solent should be cordon'd hoff for Hemperors once a year,
For a mix o' Margit manners, and Salvationists, and beer,
Ain't no welcome for a Kyser, no, nor yet a Shazydar,
As demmocrycy is gettin' too permiskus like, by far.
A.orty. Owen ZolleRN didn't ought to be mixed hup
With Bank’Olidays and bikes, when he's a runnin for a Cup.
'Tis his seventh Solent wisit, and things went a trifle rum;
And if he took the Himperial’Ump and next year didn't come,
Wºy it wouldn't be serprisink, and hus BULLs, and Cowes, would suffer,
Whate'er that HEMPERoR may be, he ain't no idle duffer!
The Guv'nor, he hadmires him most tremenjus; so do hi.
It is suthink almost touchin' for to see him, smart and spry
In his simple yotting costoom, with his snowy cap an' ducks,
A-taking it so heasy, though he'd none the best of lucks.
And his hironclads!!! Great Gumbo—as the Guv'nor loves to say—
They do not spare the powder, and if this is but their }. -
Idon't want to see'em workin'. The young HEMPERORw ºd about—
With our Guv'nor on his track, too, don't you make no sort of doubt-

From the scrubbin' of a binnycle or the twirlin' of a mop,

He fair shaddered the }. KYSER. And the story he'd reherse,
With a eloquence and hunction quite like droppin' into werse.
And he always soots the haction to the word in sech a way,
That when fairly on the cackle he's as good as any play.
But, O, MARY it wos orkerd, and yumillyhating too,
When our yot—her name's the Polywog—to git a better view,
Shoved ’erself a bit too forrad, and, amidst a general skoff,
Wostackled by a snortin' tug, and coolly carted hoff
Guv swore he'd tell his pal the Dock but p'raps that wos his fun;
He also said he’d arºk him why the Meteor didn't run.

House of Commons, Mon-

the old place. Same ad-
dress; same walls; same

but almost entirely new
company. SQUIRE of MAL-
wood lends friendly look to
Front Opposition Bench. But
there are many vacant places
to right and left of him.
Where is John MoRLEY, and
ARNoLD MoRLEY, and SHAw-

SARK, looking round on other quarters of House, cannot refrain
from dropping a salt if silent tear. “You this the House of

CLEoPHAs? One black man may be as good as another, and even
better; that is the MARKiss's affair. As WIRGIL wrote of Trºjan ||

But how is Parliament going to limp along without our CoNYBEARE,
our SEYMoUR KEAY, and our Don't KEIR HARDIE * I suppose it's
all right. The SPEAKER will take Chair at usual hour; questions
will be put and answered; Bills will make progress and ‘the House
will now adjourn.' But if the House of Commons is itself without
the eminent persons I have mentioned, I at least shall not be able to
recognise its identity.” -
“Oh, cheer up,” said St. John BrodRick, Premier-maker,
Destroyer of Majorities, sort of Parliamentary WARwick. “You
don't know what the future may have in store for you. There are
fathomless possibilities in this unfamiliar crowd. It’s true no new

º: live up to that introduction. The fact is, it probably had
something to do with his distinct failure. It raised expectation too
high, and even his collarless shirt, his short jacket, his Tweed cap,
and his tendency to shed papers out of his over-stuffed pockets as
he walked about the premises, didn't make up what was lacking.”
Whilst WARwick BRodrick talking, he was constantly turning
over things in his pockets. Thought at first it was money. “Been
drawing your salary a quarter in advance?” I asked, anxious to
learn the †: of the new Ministry.
“No,” said WARwick, “it’s not that. See,” he said, picking out
handful of small bullets; “these are what we use in the new rifles
fired with cordite, Nice things you know. Will hop across two
miles before you know where you are. In the other pocket got a few
charges of cordite. No! Rather not see them? Well, no account-
ing for prejudice. I mean to #. a º always on hand, or rather

But they'll try and form up by-and-by. When they do, I'll show
'em a cordite cartridge, rattle a few of these bullets, with their
cupro-nickel jackets, and, poof! they’re off just as they were when
I defeated the late Government in June. Can't have too much of a

HARRY ON ARRY.
[“There is no doubt whatever that a large
number of Englishmen abroad conduct themselves
in a manner which brings discredit on our country.
Such demonstrations, indeed, are taken to
mean that our countrymen desire thereby to show
their consciousness of superiority over foreigners.
We do not want “ #. ” to disgrace us,
no matter whether the “trippers” ride in first,
second, or third-class carriages.”
The “Echo” on “English Tourists Abroad.”)
DEAR BERTIE,--I have got the needle, and
got it exceedingly sharp.
This 'ARRY-I mean the cad-cockney well
known to “the 'Eath and the 'Arp”—
Is becomin' no end of a nuisance all round;
... but I think you'll agree
It is playin' it pretty low down when they
mix up that mongrel with me !
One would think the dropped aitch and apos-
trophe ought to have labelled that brand,
Which the Comics, in picture and patter,
have scattered all over the land;
But surely some new Trades Mark Act must
be wanted exceedingly bad
*When HARRY, the travellin' Briton, is
jumbled with 'ARRY the Cad.
Just glance at the cutting enclosed. Now I
travel, in silks, as you know,
And Paris and Lyons to me are familiar as
Bradford or Bow,
But a gent is a gent, though in trade, and
abroad just as much as at home,
And the manners that pass in Pall Mallought
to do for Berlin or for Rome!
I’m sick, my dear fellow, of readin’ about
British Cads on the trip,
And the wº they rough-up theforeigners.
EV rench barber or snip,
With a back that's all hinges and angles,
will read us a lesson on form,
And the penny-a-liners at home back him
up, and we–bow to the storm
It's rot, and there’s no other word for it ! I
mean rebellin' for one.
All this talk about 'Arries Abroad, which the
ink-slingers think such prime fun,
Is all unpatriotic knock-under, poor tame
cosmopolitan cant,
And as much a true bill as the chat of that
sour Mrs. ORMISTON CHANT.
If there’s anythin' gives me the hump, it is
hearin' Old England run down;
And your Rads, and your Cads, and your Cock-
tails, all haters of Class and the Crown,
Are eternally bastin' John BULL on his
bullyin' airs and stiff back.
0 it gives me the very go-nimble to hear
their contemptible clackl
They charge us with bounce and bad manners,
with trottin' around in queer togs,
With chaffin' the waiters at cafés, and treatin'
the porters like dogs.
They say we raise shines in their churches,
and mock their processions and priests;
In fact, if you'd only believe them you'd
class us as bullies and beasts.
Now I say a Briton's a Briton wherever he
happens to go.
He has got to be “taken as written,” with
freedom his briar to blow,
His flannels and bowler to sport, his opinions
and tastes to express
As he would in Hyde Park or the St rand, and
he won't be contented with less.
He takes “Rule, Britannia” along with him,
young JoHNNY BULL does, you bet;
And it's no use for Germans to grunt, and it's
no use for Frenchmen to fret.
We’ve got to be free, my dear fellow; -no
matter if welcome or not, -
And to slang us as “”Arries Abroad” for
that freedom is all tommyrot.
That Johnny who writes about 'ARRY—in
Punch don'tcher know—is a Rad,
I can see it as plain as be blowed; and he
labels the lot of us “Cad”
If we’ve patriot hearts and high spirits, talk
slang, and are fond of a spree,
But his 'ARRY's no class, and it’s like his
dashed cheek to confound him with me !

Of tarrin' the classes and masses, without

ON ACRoss BENCH.-The Union

spread as far as Limerick, if the
meetings of the Limerick Rural

that the Conservative Government
would do as much for the
labourers as the Whig Govern-
ment had done.

PUERIs REVERENTIA!—The ad-

is “up” again before the Glas-
gow bailies. The Town Council
has banished these disfigure-
ments, but it seems there are
still Philistine bodies who long
for the good old flaring coloured-
poster days. Witness this account
of a recent meeting :-
Mr. BATTERSBy pointed out that a
large revenue could be derived from
advertisements on the cars, and he
did not see why the committee should
look over such a thing.
Bailie PATon said that personally
he was dead against putting adver-
tisements on the cars. If any neces-
sity arose they had that source of
revenue. He would not spoil the
beautiful appearance of the cars by
vulgarising them.
Mr. BATTERSBY. —That is all senti-
ment of a very puerile description.
º But as there happens
to be a large balance to the good
on the working of the cars, why
not allow the “puerile senti-
ment” to have play? We could
do with a lot of this kind of
puerility and sentimentality down
south.

“A Junior of Fifty Years' Standing” considers that no one should
be admitted to an Inn of Court who was unwilling to join the “Devil's

riflemanthan as a counsel. “And yet,” he adds, “I found the labour
very light. I do not believe I attended more than one parade in the
course of a year on the average.” I, may add, that possessing the
name of “A Junior of Fifty Years' Standing,” I can vouch for
my learned friend's accuracy, eminence, and ability.
“A Judge who prefers Newmarket to the Law Courts,” proposes
that the corridors should be utilised as a drill-ground. “Let the

“One who takes three years of practice to earn a quarter of

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
PRESIDENT ANDREws, of Brown University, has contributed to
the North American Regieſ an article entitled "Are there Too
Many of Us?” . Personally, I should answer with an unhesitating
yes, especially after Bank Holidays, or fêtes and galas such as those
with which the provinces teem. ... And it may be noted, by the way,
as a curious fact in the natural history of amusements, that no
genuine fête is ever found without a gala. Conversely a gala with-
out a fête cannot be imagined. From the presence in your neigh-
bourhood of one of the two you are at once entitled to infer the
presence of the other.
I RETURN, however, to Professor ANDREws. He proves by a series
of elaborate and convincing calculations that if the world started
with a population of two, the increase in 3,000 years would have
become “two quintillion human beings; viz., to every square yard
3,333% persons. Or the earth would be covered with men in columns
of 833}| each, standing on each others heads. If they averaged five
feet tall, each column would be 4,1663 feet high.”
ALL this sounds highly stupendous. As I am no mathematician, I
cannot compete with Professor ANDREws of Brown University on
equal terms, but to my non-mathematical mind the only inference
to be drawn from the Professor's calculation appears to be that the
world is not much more than thirty years old, or, let us say, 30}. In
another ten years or so, I suppose we shall have to start work on the
columns. Personally, I am not impatient. I am quite willing to let
832 of my friends get into position first. I can then climb up and
complete the column. How the fractional third is to be made up I
know not, unless-happy thought—there is to be an extra allowance
of three tailors to every column.
THE Social Democratic Federation has been meeting in conference
at Birmingham. Comrades QUELCH, BELCHER, SHAYER, GEARD,
Tooth, TEMPEST, WATTs and WENIINGTON, were all on the spot.
Some discussion took place with reference to Justice, the official
organ of the Federation.
Mr. BELCHER (Lincoln), in the course of discussion, thought they ought to
induce the workers to take up shares, and to back Justice to the fullest
extent. They were inclined to sneer at, capitalists, but they could not
carry on the Federation work without taking a leaf out of the capitalist's
book. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. M'PHERson, as one of the auditors, said the branch accounts in
reference to Justice were a disgrace. A great deal was heard about the im-
morality of capitalists, but a little more morality was wanted in some of the
branches in regard to the paying of accounts.
This, of course, is most lamentable. Even a Social Democrat, it
seems, cannot alter hard facts or get on without money. And at
resent nobody seems in want of the particular kind of justice which
essrs. QUELCH, BELCHER and other comrades are anxious to purvey.
I LIKE to rescue from the dark unfathomed caves of ocean any gem
of purest ray serene. Here is one extracted from the speech of Mr.
Powell WILLIAMs, M.P., at the recent dinner of the Birmingham
Conservative Club.
Mr. Powell WILLIAMs, M.P., proposed “The Press,” and said that
before he spoke of the Press he º ike to correct a statement which Sir
Meysey Thompson made. That gentleman thought that Yorkshire was
peculiar, inasmuch as it had got rid of something objectionable in the shape
of fever called Shaw-Lefevre. He put in a claim for distinction for the county
of Cornwall. In Cornwall they would tell you that they had got rid of the
worst kind of beer that anyone ever tasted, and that they called Conybeare.
Later on Mr. WILLIAMs said that, although the Gladstonian Press
was more numerous than the Unionist Press, it had not been able to
persuade the nation to swallow eighty Irish members—which is,
erhaps, fortunate; since, to take only one, I am sure Mr. TIM
LY would prove a very tough morsel to digest.
AND here is a rose that, but for me, might have blushed unseen in
the report of the proceedings of the South Dublin Union:—
Mr. LENEHAN moved, in accordance with notice—“That the pauper in-
mate nurses be removed from the male and female Roman Catholic hospitals,
and also from the Protestant male and female hospitals, and trained nurses
engaged to look after the sick poor.” During the course of a lengthened
address, delivered in a remarkably loud voice, he urged that the present
system of nursing was bad, that militiamen were employed for the purpose,
and that reliance could not be placed on the paupers at present engaged in
the hospitals. He said that there were at present, 184 inmates employed in
nursing, and he proposed to put a trained nurse in each ward, that would
be 43, and two nurses in each hospital, that would be 8, or 51 in all. These
51 nurses, at £30 a year, or 11s. 6d., would be a little over £29 (laughter),
or a saving of some shillings (laughter).
Mr. Sykes.—What in the world is the meaning of that calculation ?
Mr. LENEHAN repeated his statement amidst great laughter.
Mr. O'REILLY said he would second the motion for the sake of discussion,
as Mr. LENEHAN complained that his resolutions were never seconded.
Mr. ByRNE was surprised that Mr. O'REILLY had seconded the resolution,
for Mr. O'REILLY was a sensible man—
Mr. LENEHAN.—I deny that (laughter).
Mr. ByRNE said it was all braggadocio, and a desire to obtain notoriety,
that made Mr. LENEHAN bring this forward.
After this no one will be surprised to hear that Mr. LENEHAN
withdrew his motion. It must be a terrible thing to be accused of
braggadocio and a desire to obtain notoriety.
AND finally here is an estimate of Mr. BALFOUR from a correspon-
dent of the Birmingham Daily Gazette :-
THE UNIonist MAJoBITY.--To the Editor of the “Daily Gazette.”—SIR,-
Among the many causes assigned for the above, no one, so far as I know, has
suggested the following one. Is it too much to hope that the statesmanlike
character of Mr. A. J. BALFour has influencad greatly the country at large
His simple dignity, both in º and minority, his pluck and energy as Irish
Secretary, are still remembered. The Spectator publishes an article on “Mr.
Balfour's Benignity,” and at the reception given to the Medical Association at
the Imperial Institute he and his sister were received with deafening cheers.
Lastly, we shall hear nothing from himself. Surely all parties recognise and
admire such a statesman, and willingly confide in his future.—AN Outsider.
But why are we to hear nothing from Mr. BALFOUR himself. As
one who likes good speaking on either side cf the House, I hope we
may hear a great deal from Mr. BALFour.
THERE have been great doings at Cirencester.

At a fete (and gala)

of a captive balloon, which was expected to make trips during the
afternoon. Unfortunately, however, the gas-main in the Tetbury
Road, where the balloon was filled, was not so large as was desirable,
and the result was that the balloon was not filled till after five
o'clock. It was then taken to the scene of the fete at Pope's Seat,
where every effort was made to make up for lost time. The Hon; B.
BATHURST, M.P., the newly elected member for the division, made a
short speech from the balloon, being received with loud cheers. The
“right away”, ascent was afterwards, abandoned. The evening,
which proved fine, closed with an excellent display of fireworks by
Professor WELLs.
If a captive balloon should refuse to inflate,
And should linger too long flopping loose on the grass,
Just insert an M.P. in the car to orate,
And you'll promptly secure an abundance of gas.

Until your double-dyed deceit grew plain.
I like to think my letter was, when read,
A note of pain.

claring that “the speech was

ME and a werry old Frend of mine has seized the hoppertoonity
that ardly ever okkers to too frends as has little or jº. to do for
a hole week, to thurrowly enjoy theirselves for that time, and see
weather sutten places in our little world is reelly as butiful and as
t injoyable as sum peeple tries to make
out as they is. Our fust place was
Epping Forrest, where we spent a hole
day from morning to nite in what my
frend called such a gallaxy of buty
and wunder as werry likely werry few
peeple ever has injoyd as we did. We
spent hole miles among the most buti-
ful Forest Trees as was ever seed, every
º, single tree of which was rather more
-Z/lſº A. butiful than the last, and not one of
- - which but what was a reel bootiful
º studdy. It took us jest about two
zº - hours to eat our dinner afore we set
--- º to work again to pollish off the lovely
C C. º trees we had not yet seen; and then.
º when we had pollished off the last of
º them, we staggered to our werry last
Cº-º carridge, and took the sleep of the
Just, and did not wake up till Brekfust come kindly to our assist-
|ance, and helped us to sett out and try again to dishcover similar
i. ºf delish usinjoyment to those so marwellusly injoyed the day
ore .
The trees as we xamined on the secund day was quite a diffrent
class to them on the fust, and emused us every bit as delifefully as
the fust sett, tho they was quite a diffrent, sett alltogether. In
won place we drove bang into the wery middel of the thickest wood,
and there we both lost ourselves for nearly three ours, but it wasn't
a minnet too much for us, for we both agreed that, upon the hole, it
was about the werry loveliest part of the hole day's proceedens, and
tla we shoud not regret havin to repeat it the next day. Oh them
hundereds and thowsends of lovely Trees! every one of which seems
far more butiful than the last, and quite equal to any we had yet seen.
At one place we was showed the place where Good Quean ALIZE-
BETH always went up stairs on Orseback, coz she did not like going
up stairs in public. At another we was showed where the present
QUEEN sat in her privet Carridge, and made the hole nayberhood
bow to her by the hunderd. Tom and Me both went up to the Y.
lace, and pinted it out to them as didn't kno it, which made us bot
eel werry grand. The werry next day, we had made all our derange:
ments for follering up our prewins wisitashun, and making a grand
fi-nayle of the hole lovely affare, when, to our tremenjus disapint-
ment, the wind begun for to blow most orfully, and the rain begun
for to rain wus as I beleeves, and as ToM beleeves, than ewer it did
afore, and so we was both obleeged for to leeve our truly lovely
forests, and defer our tree climing till a much more drier hoppertoo-
nity, which we both bleeves will appear in about a week, and then
we shall renew our grand old wisit as before, and lern again to
beleeve in our hundereds and thowsends of the most buteful trees as
ewen old hingland can brag about, as the most lovelyest as the
world ewer saw. -
And to think that all the lovely places as we seed in them three

more artily for the glorius days still in store for us! Robert.
SERGEANT-MAJoR and Mrs. BAKER were one of a trio of couples
successful in winning their claim to the prize of a flitch of bacon at
Dunmow. Three hundred and sixty-six days of married life with-
out a flitch—we should say, hitch—in the flow of amicable intercourse
is, nowadays, a marvellous achievement, and merits due recognition.
We, however, commiserate the gallant and hambitious sergeant-
major on having his matrimonial intentions aspersed by the opposing
counsel, who, in attempting to “save the bacon,” suggested that
“BAKER had one eye on the lady and the other eye on the flitch.”
The prospect of a reward even "more lasting than ham” would
hardly, it is to be feared, serve to keep ordinary couples from “tiffs.”

A LITTLE HOLIDAY.
(By Our Own Enterprising Explorer.)
‘WHY not go to Amsterdam?” At first sight this conundrum
had the customary couple of answers, “No time, no money.” But
these were incorrect solutions.
“My dear Sir,” said the Secretary of a Society organised to bring
happiness into the humblest home (pronunciation with, or without
aspirates, according to the taste of the speaker), taking me up
smartly, “you can get there in less than no time, remain there
less than no time, and be back in less than no time. We can
manage that for you.”
“But the expense?”
“We should not be a Society organised to bring happiness into
the humblest home if we could not manage that also. k here:
start Day 1 at 6.30 P.M.; be in Amsterdam morning of Day 2.
Pause of thirty-six hours for refreshment; then back again, to
happiness into the humblest home we charge, a guinea for
travelling expenses, which includes a state cabin in the saloon of
an excellent boat.”
So I closed with the Secretary, and brought away happiness to my
humble home. On the whole that
happiness was maintained. It is true
that the excellent boat was rather
leisurely in her movements. I went
to the Hook of Holland in a gale,
which was kind fº to wait for my
return off the Dutch coast. and ac-
company me back to the white cliffs
of Albion. ...The excellent boat seemed
to be on gº." friendly terms with this
gale, and to enjoy its company. , In-
stead of flying from shore to shore,
after the fashion of other steamers, the

inger anguidly, amongst every

both coming and #: several hours
late. She appeared during the voyages
to keenly appreciate a characteristic
movement in sea. That characteristic
“That characteristic move-
ment in sea produced more
gravity than, gaiety amongst the movement in sea produced more gravity
passengers. than gaiety amongst the passengers.
Leaving the excellent boat out of the question—which boat, by the
way, would no doubt have been more than excellent minus the
gale–the journey “there and back” was accomplished with comfort
and despatch.
On my arrival at Amsterdam. I found myself in a city that, in its
main characteristics, was not entirely unlike Brixton. The shops and
the people were both suggestive of the southern suburb. The trams
that, according to the guide-books, “traversed the town in every
direction,” were also reminiscent of that delightful haven of rest
(from Saturday to Monday) of the overworked stockbroker and the
underworked Government employé.
“You are sure to like Amsterdam,” a friend of mine had said, as
he pressed my hand, at parting, “because it’s exactly like the
Regent's Park Canal.”
Myfriend was right, Amsterdam certainly resembles the Regent's
Park Canal, but, plus Brixton. No doubt it is for this reason that it
is sometimes called “the Northern Wenice.” The people, too, had a
suburban look about them. I felt sure that most of them were called
SMITH, BROWN, JONES, and RoPINson, with perhaps a conventional
“dam”. tacked on to the end of their names to show that b
nationality they were Dutchmen... I approached one of these ...
honest creatures, , who looked like SMITHDAM, and in my best
broken English asked for the Hotel Amstel... I pronounced the latter
word as if the last syllable rhymed with “peal.”. Mr. SMITHDAM
stared at me and shook his head. Then he said “Nine.”
“’0tel Amstale,” I continued, with a new pronunciation. “You
know what mean I–'0tel Amstale?”
But Mr. SMITH DAM didn't. He smiled, and again shook his
head., This annoyed me, so I, murmured, “What an ass this chap
must be; fancy not knowing the way to the Amstel Hotel!”
“Amstel Hotel,” he cried, with a pronunciation infinitely more
English than my own, and then most courteously gave me the route.
I thanked him with effusion, and most probably should have found
his directions of infinite value had he but delivered them in English
instead of Dutch. As it was, I put myself into a London-looking
cab (the driver very F. wore a military cockade), and was soon
at one of the best hostelries in Holland. Situation pleasant—of
tº lººkins a canal—rooms comfortable, kitchen all that could
e desired,
And now what did I do in Amsterdam? Why, I went to the
London in time for breakfast on Day 4. And with a view to bringing |f
Exhibition. And what was it like P Well, a Dutch edition of those |d
_-
that had gone, before. At the Naval display before the Royal
Hospital at Chelsea, there was a model of the Victory, with a repre-
sentation in wax of the Death of Nelson. At Amsterdam, there is a
model of a mail-boat, with a representation (in breathing humanity)
of Fº drinking beer.
t Paris there was a Tour Eiffel, with a magnificent view at the
summit; at Amsterdam there is a tower in the shape of a colossal
elephant, with a fine display on every floor of beer. At South Ken-
sington there was a realistic reproduction of Old London on tem-
perance###". At Amsterdam there is a realistic reproduction
of Old Holland served with beer. Go where I would I ran across
beer. The grounds of the Exhibition were dotted with booths,
Before many of them were very decent orchestras discoursing sweet
music. But the foreigners were there not only to attend to the
music, but to drink beer. The Exhibition proper (contents small
and select, with few English exhibits) was not apparently much of
an attraction. I readily understood the reason-it was not devoted
exclusively to beer. In what I may term the Exhibition annex I
ound any number of imens of the oriental merchants in the
fezes, who were wont in the olden days to enhance the joys of
Olympia and Earl's Court. -
“Come here, gentlemans,” cried half a dozen in a breath, “I will
sell you this! 53 -
But they didn't. Having done the exhibition and the admirable
museum, with its wonderful armour, and marvellous old masters, I
sampled a music hall. I went to “the ºl. Palace” (vide guide-
books), a magnificent building, that no doubt had been built with
the highest aspirations and had come in the progress of time to the
loftiest tumblings. A portion of this noble institution had been con-
verted into a place of entertainment. Small stage with miniature
scenery, trapeze, orchestra. Audience almost entirely Dutch, enter-
tainment almost entirely English. Several British singers. One, a
gentleman in evening dress covered by a long Newmarket overcoat,
with a répertoire redolent of Holborn and the Surrey side, sang
about “Nine in a row’’ who (so I understood him to assert)
“rolled, down the street” when (if I am not mistaken) they were
rather “rocky about their feet.” Then he had another ditty which
referred to his want of value. Was he worth anything P. He
*. to the Dutch audience. Some of them (possibly friends of
the singer) replied in the negative. Then he express is con-
viction that he ought to be chucked out. The spectators cheered,
and seemed well satified with the programme. hether they were
able to appreciate all the topical allusions is open to doubt, but I am
certain that they were thoroughly enjoying their beer.
I went to the market. An enormous crowd surrounded one booth.
The salesman was º: song in honour of his wares, which were
composed of pieces of broken iron 1 So far as I could understand the
manners and customs of the vendors, the golden rule seemed to be
amongst them, “When in doubt take off the door to the outhouse
with the three broken panes of glass, the back parlour chandelier that
lacks a chain, and the disused baby's cradle, and sell 'em all by
auction.”
I looked in, of course, at the Cathedral. My guide could not speak
French, but he understood English. He showed me the tombs of
several admirals.
“Where is WAN TROMP P” I asked, taking an interest in the career
of about the only Dutchman whose name I know intimately. Then,
to make it plainer, I added, “Whar is das WAN TRoMP P”
My guide turned up his nose contemptuously, and said something
(so far as I could comprehend him) about WAN TROMP being in “de
odder kirsher.” Later on, when I asked the use of a sort of vestry,
he murmured something about “Balaclava.” From this I took it
that he could not make himself understood. But I was wrong. I
did not know much about the Dutch coinage. When I bought ſº,
thing I invariably kept my hand waiting for change until the supp{{
was exhausted. Sometimes I put forth my hand a second time wi
the result of getting a few extra coins. There are guilders, little
pieces that look like a doll's silver pennies, and a showy coin that
suggests a sixpence in a decline. These latter are worth, I fancy,
about three halfpence a dozen. I gave the cathedral custodian one
of these .*. in a decline. But it was not enough, not nearly
enough, so I exchanged it for a doll's silver penny, when he
beamed with gratitude.
Would that I could tell of the other attractions of Amsterdam, of
the Royal Palace, the Zoo, the theatres, and the canals. But exi-
gencies of time and space say “No.” Those who want to see and
hear have only one thing to do. Let them hie to the Hook of
Holland, ho, to the Dutch capital, and further description will be
unnecessary.
DURING a severe thunderstorm at Bjelina, in Bosnia, according
to the Pall Mall Gazette's “Science Notes,” there fell a remark-
able “shower of whitebait.” This phenomenon has been easily
eclipsed at London, in England, where it recently rained cats and
Ogs.

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
It is a t thing to know—and one must believe it if one
believes, as I do, in what the newspapers º. every single male
member of the º; or fashionable ranks of society is at this moment
engaged in, slaughtering grouse. It is of course well known that
every member of Parliament is, on his election, ..". by a
grateful country with a large , and well-stocked grouse-moor
situated in one of the most picturesque and romantic parts o
Scotland, and no one (not even a brewer) is ever raised to the
}.º unless he can prove that at least three generations of his
emily have shot grouse regularly on the 12th of August on a moor
of their own. Thus is the connection of both branches of our legisla-
ture with sport safeguarded.
WHENEVER the 12th of August, or, for the
matter of that, the 1st of September or the 1st of
October, comes round with the revolving year, we
are informed in every newspaper that “Sportsmen
were early astir.” There is about these words a
halo of tradition so ancient and venerable as to
have become almost sacred. Imagination conjures
up the picture of happy bands of shooters all dul
booted, gaitered, gunned, cartridged and cigarred,
sallying forth with dogs and keepers at 5 A.M., no
doubt after eating, as condemned men do, a heart
breakfast. Of course this may be so...I haver
it so often that I hardly dare to doubt it. My own
experience, however, is, that sportsmen are not
specially early even on the 12th, although keepers
and other professional guns who cater for the
London market are often so early as to anticipate by more than a
few hours the recurring anniversary.
Now with black London's close and torrid street
Stern Caledonia's heathered moors compete.
Lo, well equipped with jºi and gun,
Concurrent streams of rank and fashion run
Where, though the birds be strong upon the wing,
Not unrewarded sounds the frequent ping;
Where dealing fate to feather (and to fur)
The earl rtsman is perceived astir,
And in the lengthy language of the chase,
A bird's no bird, but merely half a brace.
Some skilful, some not fit to shoot for nuts,
Walk for their game or take their stand in butts;
And, wondrous fact, as all the scribes proclaim,
Each from a separate butt destroys his game.
At least it was so when the EMPEROR shot, so
With non-Imperials it perhaps is not so.
I AM never irritable i. I am sometimes justifiably annoyed
by the unreasonable conduct of a friend. But I have often noticed
the most melancholy irritability in others, and have wondered why
they gave way to it, and what it portended. Now I know. I have
been reading the Medical Press and Courier, and Ilearn from it that
“this hypertesthesia of the temper is the direct outcome of over-
work and want of sleep; in fact, it is a morbid sensitiveness of the
cells of the cerebral cortex, due to exhaustion or under-nutrition.
Irritability is, therefore a clinical sign of some importance, the more
so because it is, often the premonitory indication of impending
breakdown. , Under these circumstances, the condition is usually
most marked during the forenoon, and is associated with a distaste
for food at breakfast time. Later on, even the humanising effect of
a good lunch fails to raise circulatory activity to the standard
required for adequate cerebral nutrition, and the irritability becomes
chronic, yielding only to the influence of repeated doses of a diffusible
stimulant, such as brandy and soda. The remedy naturally only
aggravates the symptom, which is sooner or later followed by other
manifestations of cerebral exhaustion.”
WHEN you're lost in the whirl of a medical vortex, .
You gasp and you , and you’ll struggle in vain;
For it seems you have in your cerebral cortex,
ich is somehow ... Ifancy, with brain.
Exhausted and panting with under-nutrition,
You dare not presume to declare yourself well,
And you rapidly tend to complete inanition,
Produced by a morbidly sensitive cell. -
The result is a wound to the temper, a something
Not as deep as a well, but, no matter, it serves,...
Perplexing your friends, who pronounce it a rum thing
at Dick—that’s yo —should have gone in the nerves,
You toy with your breakfast; the kidney, the kipper,
The egg that is buttered, the egg that is fried,
The tea that once : a regular sipper
Unsipped and untasted you push them aside.
Your lunch of cold beef with the gaff and the shandy,
You #. can't face it, your head is one ache:
A “diffusible stimulant” (alias brandy)
Is all that you wish for and all that you take.
A day or two back all your manners were courtly,
Alas, what a change is apparent to-day,
Fº jump on your friends, and you take them up shortly,
ith a quarrel a minute whatever they say.
Then, in spite of the canon that's set 'gainst self-slaughter
(In the language of verdicts it's felo de se,)
Some day you’ll be found with your head in the water,
Six inches will do, or attached to a tree.
THERE have been some difficulties at Brierly Hill. At a recent
meeting of the Urban Council a letter was read from the Local
Government Board asking for information with regard to a com-
munication which Dr. ELLIS, the medical officer of health, had
addressed to them. This referred to the fact that Dr. ELLIs had
ordered a “dumb' well at the Town Hall to be cleared out.
What is the use of a dumb well? Even if it contains the truth
it cannot speak it. Personally, I prefer a babbling brook.
WHAT is this? Is it a revolution or merely a mistake P Do I
sleep, do I dream, or is visions about? These questions occur to me
on reading that at Ironbridge the other day a
clown, a member of a circus, was brought up on
remand charged with stealing £1 10s. and several
articles, the property of his landlady. And he was
actually sentenced to fourteen days' hard labour.
All I can say is that I have rarely allowed a year ||
to pass without seeing, at least one clown steal a
string of sausages, a lady's bonnet, two plump
babies, half a dozen fowls, the greater part of a
general dealer's property, and the upper half of a
liceman. Nobody bothered him about it. In QR
act, everybody expected him to do it, and there -
would have been great dissatisfaction if he had observed the laws
i. larceny. And yet when a clown at Ironbridge acts as
clowns are intended to act, an unfeeling bench visits him with a
fortnight of hard labour. This is preposterous. There ought to
be an Amalgamated Union of Clowns to protect its members from
such an outrage.
Those who study the reports of meetings of Town Councils learn
many things, For instance, at Bristol the other day, during a dis-
cussion of passenger tolls at the docks, Mr. GoRE complained that
they had been hocussed by the chairman of the sub-committee that
day. . Mr. BAKER objected to the word “hocussed” being applied to
him, but added that they had been hocussed out of a good deal of
time to-day, and Mr. GoRE retorted that they were going to be
hocussed out of another quarter-of-an-hour yet. Mr. BAKER asked
Mr. GoRE to withdraw the word, and Mr. GoRE refused. Matters
had apparently come to a desperate pass, when it occurred to the
Mayor to inquire what the word “hocussed” meant...Mr. BAKER
thought it was something akin, to cheating, whereupon Mr. GoRE, in ||
the handsomest manner, said that knowing the meaning of the word ||
he would now withdraw it. . The only thing that was not explained
was why Mr. GoRE had used a word of the meaning of which he was
ignorant. There is a fatal attraction about the sound of certain
words which forces speakers to use them entirely without regard to
their actual meaning.

[A correspondent, writing (to the Daily Chronicle) from Harwich, describes
the deplorable condition of work prevailing among the shrimp catchers.
“These poor fellows,” he says, “are at sea twelve hours a day catching, and
have to devote four hours more to boiling and packing for London. And yet
'all the middlemen send them down is from fourpence to fivepence a gallon.”]

Why called “Torrs Walks”?... Probably original Toºks who dis-

feet into boiling sea; boiling sea made it hot for the unhappy ToRRs;
Tonks only walking, not swimming. Therefore end of Tohhs.

| Tilbury Wharf. “And at this wharf of Tilbury” why not more
porters? Why not a covering to the landing-stage, where at present,
the traveller, like the sky parlour in ancient song, ‘‘ exposed to the
| wind and the rain,” will be thoroughly drenched while awaiting the
advent of the tender. Happy Thought.--To-day, fortunately, fine.
These queries occur to me as I stand on this floating quay, and
witness in the distance the “tender parting.” . There will be many
| “a tender parting” beside this one to be seen when the Orotava gets
her steam up, and quits Tilbury for Melbourne.
We board the Orotava, which is to board and lodge so many of
them (with another contingent going overland, and joining the ship
later on) for the next month or so. -
I am personally introduced to the captain by some kindly friends
who come to see me off, and whom, as I lose sight of them in the
crowd, it is soon my turn to “see off”; as subsequently I can only
catch a glimpse of them in the crowd, on the tender, as they depart
for shore, when we wave hands to one another implying thereby all
sorts of good wishes. After making the captain's acquaintance, I am
introduced by some light-hearted companion—everyone on board is
either boisterously gay or in the deepest grief—to a good-humoured-
looking portly gentleman, whom, there being nothing whatever nauti-
cal in his appearance, I should have taken for a landed º:
“one of the olden time,” had I not very soon discovered him to be
something uncommonly superior in the Nautical Pacific Service, and
the friend in need, without whom no passenger's happiness is com-
plete, that is, speaking from practical experience, if the destination
of that passenger is only Plymouth, as was mine.
Farewell / The tender is about to depart. It seems to me to be as
full as when it arrived. “Cheers, tears and laughter:” only the
laughter is a bit forced, while the tears are natural, and the cheers
most hearty. The tender hesitates. Tug evidently tender-hearted;
can't bear to part with the good ship Orotava. No ; this is not the
cause of the delay. Some one is waited for. Tender crew impatient.
Where is he? Who is he?, Find him. . Some one, in ordinary frock
coat_and_top hat but clearly an official on board tender, puts both
hands to his mouth and shouts out what sounds to me like “Wait for
Mister TUBRs1”. Evidently tender cannot go ashore without Tubbs;
equally evident that TUBBs is not to sail with the Orotara. Puzzle,
to find TUBBs. Stewards, chief officers, mates, men rush in all direc-
tions to rout out TUBBs. Look-out man aloft in sort of suspended
clothes basket cannot get a sight of TUBBs either in the offing or out
of it. Nothing like TUBBs to be seen anywhere. Somebody reports
at top of voice “He’s with the captain.” Captain up above some-
where, invisible, denies soft iº as to being cognisant of
the whereabouts of TUBBs. What is TUBBs doing? Playing hide
and seek P Search light turned on into darkest and deepest depths
of Orotava. No Tubbs, Suddenly first gangway withdrawn, and
grasp of tender partially relaxed. Exciting moment. Crew of
tender rattle second gangway threateningly: their patience is
almost, exhausted. The cry goes up once more for TURBs, ahoy!
Even the weeping wives and sorrowing friends, lovers and children
forget their dear ones for a moment and strain their eyes in ...iſ
direction, gasping for a glimpse of invisible TUBBs. At last a sm
stoutish figure appears on the gangway. Is he hatless? breathless?
Not a bit of it. He walks the gangway as if he yet had hours of
leisure before him, and was quite unconscious of having kept anyone
waiting. It is TUBBs himself. The self-possession of TUBBs is re-
Mºši, nay admirable. He notices nobody. Speaks to nobody. Sud-
denlyhedisappears; thegangway is withdrawn; more cheers, more wav-
ing of pocket-handkerchiefs, and the tender, with the impassive TUBBs
to boot, drifts out of sight, and the Orotava is fairly under weigh.

THE LATEST DANGER.
(A Caution to those who are Interviewed.)
THE celebrity awaited his interviewer with
some impatience. He had arranged his story
with considerable care. He was prepared to
show that he was the best of boys at school,
the most studious of students at the univer-
sity, the worthiest of men at all times. He
felt sure that when the record of his life was
published, preparations would be made to
erect a statue and a glass window in his
bonour. And so he was satisfied.
In due course, the interviewer appeared.
The man was bland and persuasive. He
requested the celebrity to take a chair, and
then placed his hand, upon his brow. The
celebrity gazed into the eyes of his visitor
with a lack lustre stare, and then seemingly
sank into a heavy sleep.
“And now I am prepared to begin,” mur-
mured the interviewer, taking out his note-
book. “My worthy Sir, I command you to
tell me all. Mark you well—all.”
And then the celebrity, in a monotonous
tone, revealed the secrets of the past.
The celebrity was furious. The interview
ad appeared, and was far too true in the
story of its subject's life to be pleasant;
There was no assertion that the celebrity had
been the best of boys at school, the most
studious of students at the university, the
worthiest of men at all times. On the con-
trary, the celebrity had “come out” in rather
attering colours. So, that eminent man
was simply furious. He had sent for his in:
terviewer, and awaited once more his arrival
with impatience. In due course his bio-
grapher turned up. - -
“And now, Sir,” said the celebrity, in
tones trembling with anger, “what do §§.
mean by suggesting that I tried as a child to
*f; my maiden aunt P”
“Did you ?” was the calm rejoinder.
“That is beside the question. And wh
did you assert, that I had told you that
never did a day's work at the university ?”
“But you did say so—didn't you?”
“Again beside the question. And what
did you mean by stating that I had deserted
my wife, and turned my children out-of-doors
at a moment's notice?”
“But were those statements true or
untrue?”
“That you have not received a writ for

“You did.”
“I did! When, where and how P’’
“When I saw you here, and at my re-
quest.”
“I do not understand łº murmured the
puzzled celebrity. “Why should I tell you
all this?”
Then came the explanation. -
“You told me all I wanted,” replied the
interviewer, “because I am a hypnotist P’’
*Indeed!" returned the celebrity when
he had recovered from his astonishment; and
then, after a moment of deep consideration,
he gave his visitor the names and addresses
of the more hated of his rivals.

EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, August 12.--"Are you ready?
Go!” No mistaking the voice. . It was the clear, sharp notes of
HEMPRER Joe, ringing from behind SPEAKER's Chair, high above
buzz of talk and bustle of movement in crowded House. Wondering
what it might portend, when discovered PRINCE ARTHUR and
SquEE of MALwood entering simultaneously, after the fashion of
the Bounding Brothers from the Breathless Baltic. Only, if you
remember, those eminent artistes appeared in ring from directly
º approaches, advancing towards each other with startling,
ough graceful evolutions. PRINCE and SQUIRE, on contrary,
started from door at back of SPEAKER's Chair, advanced fair toe
and heel to table; walked step by step together, along either
front bench, till each reached the seat kept vacant for him.
House so surprised at this performance it almost forgot to shout.
What usually happens on like occasions is for cne Leader of
Party to take his seat amid loud cheers from his friends, taken up
with strident voice from other side when their man comes in. Now
cheers, if indulged in, would mingle, and might be misunderstocd. A
welcome meant for PRINCE ARTHUR might seem to be bestowed .
SQUIRE, and rice verzá, as Mr. ANSTEY once said. Whilst perturbed
House looked on, HEMPRER JOE, }*i; watched his men, fairly
started, reach, their goal, followed with swinging step and the
inevitable orchid. -
To see him seat himself on Treasury Bench; the right-hand man
of a Tory, Government, too much for the feelings of TIM HEALY,
usually held in stern reserve. During interval of General Election
TIM been holding sweet converse with his colleagues in general,
BLAKE and Tay PAY in particular. By odd chance he, taking his
lace in new Parliament *::::: found himself seated between his
wo friends, to whom presently entered the “dear Jrstin’” of a
yoluminous missive. Soothed by such companionship TIM in melt-
ing mood. But sight of HEMPRER Joe finally crossirg the gangway,
| #; completing. marvellous journey from Birmingham to
Hatfield, too much for trained equanimity. TIM groaned aloud.
Świrſ MacNemº roared as if in anguish. ... Dr. TANNER (figuratively
of course) cut himself with knives, emitting sounds that nearly
frightened to death two new members seated on either side of him.
L'HEMPRER smiled benignly. Clerk at Table, dexterously interpos-
ing, pointed spectral forefinger at JoHN Mowbray, who rose to
“move that the Right Hon. WILLIAM Coukt GULLY do take the
Chair as Speaker.”
A delicate task, seeing that a few short months back he had run

GEORGIE'S AND JACKY'S HOLIDAYS.
(An Extract from the Note-book of Mr. Barlow the Younger.)
I AM quite sure that, had my revered grandsire survived:-a; a
matter of fact, he passed away some time ago, leaving, a valuable
connection—he would have moved with the times. In his day he
certainly did his best to amuse his pupils by telling them agreeable
and instructive stories, but he did not actually join in their sports:
- I, his descendant, pursue the even tenor of
my way on a different tack. I have two lads
staying with me during the vacation. Their
arents are residing in the Indian portion of
* -- the British empire and the Australian colonies.
- They are bright, intelligent,boys, full of high
spirits, and yet gifted with an amount of
: I - common sense much in advance of their com-
Ns, '', paratively tender years. Groß BARNWELL
\ . . . . s is generous to a fault. He will borrow six-
~s Spence of a friend to-day, and give half of it
- *= to a beggarto-morrow. His companion, JACKY
§4, s- Rush, is more economical. He, too, will bor-
- row sixpence to-day and supplement it, if
possible, by a further loan on the morrow, Consequently John is
richer, as a rule, than GEORGE. -
“See, Sir,” said Rush to me a morning or so since, “what I have
got. anks to the kindness of some acquaintances with longer
purses than my own, I have acquired a fishing-rod.”. .
... “Which I trust you will not allow him to use,” put in BARNWELL,
iº “He is considerably my junior, and I fear that, were
he to fish, he might be drawn by the strength of the current into
the water, and possibly be drowned. Such a calamity would be a
terrible thing to his parents. What would make such a blow the
more acute would be the expense of the telegram conveying the
lamentable news to India. On these grounds, revered Sir, I trust
you will forbid him the use of the fishing-rod.”
“I believe the apprehensions of my comrade are unnecessary,”
said sensible JACKY. “I feel convinced, however, that they spring
from the best motives, as he refused to have anything to do with the
purchase of the rod, on the score that he thought I would be tempted
to use it. Now that I have bought it with my own money—”
... Your own money,” observed GEORGIE, with a smile.
“With money that has passed into my possession,” amended the
younger lad, “I shall be glad to sell the rod at a considerable dis-
count if such a financial arrangement can be entertained by my well-
intentioned companion.”
“I am sincere y grieved,” replied BARNwell to this invitation, “to
have to say “No." A rather extensive purchase of Japanese caramel
cannon-balls has entirely exhausted my pecuniary resources.
I am willing to meet JAcky half way. As he has bought the fishing-
rod, I shall be glad to hold it for him when we get to the landing-
stage, where we propose commencing our search for the denizens of
the ": deep.”
It will be noticed by the observant that up to this point, the con-
versation, had been conducted in well-chosen words, “Literary
elegance in diction” is one of the many extras that º in the
bills delivered lºy and payable in advance) to the parents of
my cherished charges. To my surprise and annoyance, JACKY,
instead of retorting with courtesy, merely placed his right hand
level with his face, extended the fingers, and allowed the thumb to
touch the nose.
“You will see, Sir,” said GEORGIE, much shocked at this vul-
garity, “that my companion at times is lost to all sense of shame. If
you are kind enough to turn aside for a moment, I shall be glad to
accomplish a feat known amongst the prize fighters of the earlier
#. º the present century as punching some one's -
ead. -
..I complied with my pupil's request, and for some
little while there were sounds not entirely unsug-
gestive of lamentation. Sounds which seemed to
cause no little amusement to an observant’Arry.
. Qur walk to the place of fishery after this little -
incident was uneventful. When we reached the
spot, a rough-looking mariner was in attendance
º what subsequently appeared to be a bag of
l
“Morning gents, all,” said thesailor, respectfully;
“I have got what you want. But be careful how ...
you touch them, as they are nasty customers.” *
. This warning was j} or GEORGIE (who
is of an inquiring character) had placed his hands
amongst the worms with results. He uttered an exclamation of
pain. “Ah, I thought sol” cried the mariner, looking at my
charge's travel-stained palm; “you have been bitten by a blue
doctor. Well, all you have to do is to climb º the moat under
that there castle and find some mote weed. Put the weed on the spot
and the pain will go like magic.”
But | tasty
“But its quite a mile up hill,” observed the still depressed BARN-
well. “What shall I do while I am going?. It hurts me fearfully.”
“My dear GroRGIE,” said JACKY, who had now reassumed hi
customary demeanour, “pray be guided by the advice of this
worthy and experienced person. ... I feel sure that what he recom-
mends is salutary. And as to what you should do while mounti
the undoubtedly lofty heights leading to the castle's moat, I wo
recommend a policy of cheerful submission. Bear it, my dear boy,
with fortitude, and smile while you, perform, the heroic operation.
During your absence, I myself will hold the fishing-rod. This
concession should tend to assuage your anguish. . And, in conclusion,
let me hazard the hope that when you return from the moat with
your hand convalescent, after an application of moat weed, you will
find that I have had good sport. I trust to be in a position to
present }. with either a specimen of a salmon, a sole, a flying fish,
or a tittlebat—of course, any one or all of them for a suitable con-
sideration.”
GEORGIE waited no longer, but hastened away after kicking in the
direction of his cherished companion.
“It’s a painful bite when you ain't accustomed to it,” observed
: mainer. “Not that I mind'em. Look here, all them's bites and
stings.”
And, the man stretched forth his hand, which was certainly
covered with a variegated assortment of scars. -
“What, did that?” asked JACKY, with a stronger feeling of
curiosity than an appreciation of grammar.
“That was done, Sir, by a spiteful cat,” replied the mariner.
“It is a nasty worm is the spiteful cat. Cut them up into halves
and they will bite you st But there, the fish is awful fond
of them! Why, these here blood-clotters are nothing to them, no
more are these lug worms.”
With this, the man threw down what appeared to be a small but,
for its size, corpulent sea-serpent.
“It’s no good,” he exclaimed, scornfully. “The fish won't touch
any of that lot atter they’ve lost their shape. Look at that one, it’s
foolish to call it a worm now, ain't it? Now I will take this blue
doctor and bait the line for you. See, I run the hook through the
head to the hip. That will fetch a mufflet. It leaves me half. But
you must take a whole one for a ing.”
. By this time JACKY. was standing on the brink of the stage, all
impatient to cast his line into the water. The bait, enoumbered by
some nobs of lead, fell with a jerk into the sea.
“You had better take a seat, young master,” said the experienced
mariner; “sometimes you get bites by the dozen, at others nothing
comes near you for hours. It’s all a toss up. And the fish, too,
they are fanciful. Your dabs and your codlings are demons for rock
worm; But the mullet and whiting want something a bit more
“If that is the case,” said JACKY, who had been from time to time
watching his bait, “do you not think you could find something
more tempting than this attenuated worm, which, so far as I can
judge, has already been diminished in the water of half its stature.”
“Well, yes, Sir ; I could put on a spiteful cat. If a fish will touch
anything, he will touch spiteful cat.”
Then with admirable skill the mariner selected a bait, and in a
twinkling had the hook refurnished.
“I shall be glad to be successful,” said JACKY, “as I notice that
my cherished companion, GEORGIE, obtained the healing weed,
and is rapidly returning from the Castle's moat. He will be pleased
to find that while he has been in pain I have been enjoying a
delightful sport, with no little reward attached to it. If I were suf-
ficiently fortunate to capture a salmon, no doubt I would find a ready
market for it in London, and thus acquire a sum of money sufficient
to meet all my present necessities, and even to pay back a portion
of the sums that have, during a period extending over years, been

CABBY; OR, REMINISGENGES OF THE RANK AND THE ROAD.
(By “Hansom Jack,”)
No. I.-MY MATES AND MY FARES.
“Me and my Fares!” There's a takingish title for one o' them
books as they call “Rummynicences ſ”
Don't you imagine “Romance on the Rank” must mean dry-as-dust
yarns about Strikes, Fares and Licences.
“TREAGLE,” “Long BENIY,” and “PINEAPPLE Bob,” “OLD CURLY,”
“THE Country MAN,” “GINGER,” and “CHICKING,”
Not naming myself, if it comes to good stories, could give SHERLock
'OLMEs arf a length and a licking.
Rum names? Lor! that’s no-
think! You look down a list,
in the Sporting Snips say, of
the 'orses in running,
And any cab-rank could knock
'oles in the lot, for sheer
9ddity, jumble-up, fancy and
unning.
Many, a nickname’s a yarn in
itself, or leastways suggests
one, to them in the know
of it.
Cabby is like Sir GEORGE
LEWIS; 'e knows London's
seamiest side, though 'e
mayn't make no show of it.
Take “Coddy CowsLIP,” now !
Meaningless muddle, that
name, I’ve no doubt, to a
fare trim and toffy.
But git old C. C. on the patter
one mornin', say over a Bil-
lingsgate pheasant and
contee.
Twig 'is old countryfied dial
a-wrinkle with sly, knowing
wickedness! Lor! it's a
beano!
And yet "Coddy's got such a chawbacon chuckle, 'e passes—
with them as ain't fly—for a greeno.
What 'e don't know about cockney conniverings, and country colly-
fogs, isn't worth knowing.
Why, 'e's been everythink, ploughboy and
man, jock, “all-a-blowing-a-growing,”
Pedlar and poacher, 'orse-dealer, and ’earse-driver ! Yes, and 'is
name seems to tell the whole story
To us as 'ave 'eard it in “CowsLIP’s” soft snuffle, when over a
toddy-tot, all in 'is glory.
What I say is this: If a Cabby can't see, and take stock of, the life
of this wonderful City,
Perched 'igh on 'is box, with arf town for 'is fares, and 'is eye on
the other arf, well, it's a pity.
I’ve drove BILLY SHIKSPUR's Seven Ages, I have, and a tidy lot
more as the Swan never thought on;
For cabs wasn't up in the days of Queen Bess; though that Jaques
as a Growler I think might 'ave caught on!
I’ve known his fair moral in stror bands and capes, 'stead o'cloak
and trunk'ose. Ah! If WILLIAM 'ad driven
A 'ansom ten year—and I guess for the chance all them Venice
canals and their boats 'e'd ha’ given l—
What plays 'e'd ha’ found ready-made to 'is'ands! Was it Dizzy
as called us the London Gondôlers ?
Well, 'e knowed a thing or two, BENJAMIN did, 'bout Romance;
a lot more than your stick-in-the-'olers.
Romance f. I could reel you out yarns § the hour, as I’ve dropped
9m, or 'eard of from others, since cabbing;
But it's only when Bobby is fair on our track, or there's perks in
the wind, as we’re given to blabbing.
Trot 'em out in the Shelter sometimes to our pals; some on 'em, I
tell you, are ;P. and twittery,
Just the right stuff for them “’Aporths of All Sorts” the scrap-
'unting parties as calls theirselves littery.
Take railway-stations, theayters, and 'orsepitals, them three alone,
and, for comic or tragic, .
Imagine the drammers a driver gets glimpses of 1 Peeps through
town-winders, tool. Tell you, it's magic,
The way we spot mysteries, caught through a curtain, cock-eyed,
from our perch nigh the second-floor level,
In spins through back streets, or the sububs. The world and the

Me and my fares, and my mates on the Rank, make a pretty big
world...To a man as loves 'osses,
A Cabby's life isn't arf bad on the whole, spite of bilks and bad
weather, hard bosses and losses.
The §§ of the reins, and the flick of the whip, 'ave a fair fascination
to fellows built my way,
And dulness-that cuss of the poor!—doesn't 'unt you in spinnin'

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Now that the World has taken his wife to the sea-side or the
Continent, there is not much demand for heavy literature—especially
as the cost of the over-weight in ; is something considerable
beyond Calais—and consequently trifles light as air have become the
popular brain-food of the multitude, . In the
absence of his noble and respected chief, an Old
Retainer of the Baron has read Telling Stories,
originally published in the St. James's Gazette.
The Old Retainer can honestly declare that the
stories are not only worth telling, but being re-told
—in their presentform—they are just the things to
amuse the traveller weary of watching the hat-
box on the carriage-rack, or the third-rate moun-
tains fading into distance on the Rhine. He will
turn to them for recreation when he has tired of
sight-seeing. They are, without exception, short,
crisp, and interesting. The Old Retainer would not
think of leaving town without them. They would
be more welcome to him than his armour, and
qu'e as lºvessary as his weather-worn umbrella. The Veteran
Warder, still acting on behalf of his revered, but far-a-field, cap-
tain. has peeped into The Times Atlas, a magnificent volume
worthy of the best traditions of Printing House Square. The Aged
Watchman has sampled the maps, and found them absolutely accu-
rate in the smallest particulars. The Atlas has caused the Elderly
Sentry to think seriously of quitting his guard, and journeying to
the far North. He has not yet decided upon his destination. At the
moment of writing, his inclination gaily suggest “Greenland,”
while his banking-account sternly whispers “Southend or Herne
Bay.” In the meanwhile, the Years'-stricken, Looker-out remains
at his post, and, with a hand trembling with age and emotion,
proudly appends a signature not his own.

UNLUCKY SPEECHES.
Punch, and considerably more than this is undoubt-
edly due to it.... One father, speeding away to
Switzerland with his family, read Punch in the
train, and scribbled a note in pencil that he wanted
to help before going on his holiday, and wrote a
cheque for £7–at Dover station.”
Then the writer says that many of the con-
tributors to the Fund wanted to know whether
JIMMY and FLORRIE were real children, and
concludes with an expression of “heartiest
thanks to all concerned.” Of course, JIMMY
and FLORRIE are children of the brain, but
they are none the less real on that account.
They are types of thousands. A correspon-
dent suggests that the article is calculated to
do so much good that it should be reprinted.
This would be impracticable. However, it is
ssible to repeat “the Moral”; and this
eing so, we give it:-
“The offices of the Children's Country Holidays
Fund are at 10, Buckingham Street, Strand, and
contributions should be made payable to the Hon.
Treasurer.”

“THE CHILDREN'S COUNTRY
HOLIDAYS FUND,”
It will be remembered that a fortnight since
appeared in Punch (Vol. 109, No. 2823) an
article entitled “The Country of Cockaigne,”
written as a reminder that the above excellent
fund was not only in existence, but sorely in
need of contributions. Since then the appeal
has been answered by the charitably disposed,
and acknowledged by the proper official at
head-quarters. It is gratifying to learn that
the paper published in these pages has been
of signal service to the young clients for whom
author and artist plied pen and pencil with
so much goodwill. It is not customary to
publish “serious” contributions from volun-
tary contributors in these columns, but the
following extract from a letter received from
the Sºretºry of the “Children's Country Holi-
days Fund” is such pleasant reading that an
apology for its insertion seems superfluous:—
“‘The Country of Cockaigne' has caused such
a pressure of work here, that I am afraid the ordi-
nary duties of gratitude have been long delayed.
May I say that we, and here I speak for the London
children, are very grateful indeed.

There was a long pause. .

Away—Landing.
SUDDENLY aware of commencement of what promises to be uncom-
monly fine and large appetite when it reaches maturity. , Happy
Thought. — Find steward. Still
IHappier Thought.—Finding steward,
not for the purpose usually associated
with calling for that official on a
rough day between Dover and Calais.
On present occasion only to ask him,
when found, the hour of lunch.
Somehow he eludes my search. After
wandering about vaguely into several
other persons' cabins, 1 find myself
suddenly on a narrow lower deck.
- Don't know its technical name. And
f now “a strange thing happens.”
Before me, leaning against a rail, is
= the portly, or rather., sea-portly,
jovial-looking individual, whose
acquaintance I have already made in
captain's cabin, thoughtfully finish-
ing a cigar. #y the way, at any
--- period of our too-brief acquaintance
I never see him without cigar, which he is always just finishing,
but never commencing. At this moment his cheery countenance
wears as an expression, quite unnatural to it, as it could by
any possibility assume, for more than three minutes at a stretch.
He is addressing a flabby, cadaverous-looking individual in seedy
black trousers and coat, one button of which conceals, the upper
part of a waistcoat made of some “washing material,” and appa-
rently as greatly in need of the cleansing process as is its wearer,
In one ill-shaped, dirty hand he holds a very superior class of
umbrella, with a gold tip to it. I at once jump, to the conclusion
that its present possessor, having come by it dishonestly, has been
taken dirty-red handed, and that my stout acquaintance is a sort of
nautical magistrate, authorised to try such cases by a sort of in-
formal court-martial on board, and empowered to order the culprit,
if found guilty, to be put in irons, or to be mast-headed, or other-
wise dealt with according to maritime law.
Standing in the fº I become an interested spectator of the
trial...The evidently, guilty party, pale as a suet, dumpling, and
trembling like a jelly (remarkable culinary combination), is awaiting
his sentence. “Why didn't you go on board the tender with every
one else?” asks my Judicial and Nautical Assessor (Ifancy this is the
term in the Admiralty Court, where, if on shore, he would probably
sit attired in full naval uniform, with a judge's wig on, and a
cocked hat a top of that). The man mutters something about
“didn't hear.” “Not hear!” ejaculates the Assessor, taking a short
pull at his cigar and smiling incredulously, “not hearl when every-
one was shouting and rushing all over the ship l." Personally I can
bear witness to these facts; but, not being called as evidence for the
Crown and Anchor, I remain silent. Why even down in the engine-
rooms the stokers must have heard the shouts for “TUBBs l’” It
occurs, to me suddenly that this wretched man must, have stolen
TUBBs' umbrella. But I am at once enlightened as to the real state
of the case. “Look here, my man,” says the Judicial and Nautical
Assessor, as he critically eyes the ash of his cigar before flicking it
off while s ing to the prisoner, “you said you came on board to
see your friends off; you gave their name as ToMPKINs. Well, there
isn't such a name on the books.” This statement seems to come as
a “facer” to the cadaverous man, who, becoming more cadaverous
than ever, eyes the deck-rails askance, as if contemplating a sudden
rush and a jump into the water.
“Now, my man,” continues the Assessor, with pleasant severity
“you say you’ve got friends at Plymouth,”—the man is understoºd
to assent to this proposition in a .#. sort of way—“and you
say they'll pay for youthere.” The slightest indication of a cunning
smile momentarily illumines the Job Trotter-like countenance of the
prisoner. “Well, we don't do ess on those terms. You give
the steward three guineas, and we'll take you to Plymouth. But if
you can't pay–off you go. Here, steward, you're wanted.”. And
that officer coming up, the miserable individual with the valuable
umbrella (about which no questions have been asked) is given into
his charge by my stout acquaintance, who, as we enter the smoking-
room, says to me in an undertone, “He’s a regular 'do.' We've
hailed a boat, and he’ll be put off in two two's. He wanted to get
his passage free. He’s a 'stowaway,' that's what he is.”
A stowaway! Up to this moment of gruel disenchantment, m
sympathies have always been with the “stowaway,” I imagi
him as a poor, ill-used kind of Smike or Oliver Twist, hiding
self away among the casks in the lowest hold of the vessel, only
issuing forth in the dead of night with the rats and cockroaches,
who, suddenly coming to the upper deck in a terrific storm, steers
the ship into a peaceful haven, saves the captain from a wate
#. and who, finally, either marries the low high admiral's
ughter, or (which is more *...? the poor stowaway mutters
something about “Home,” and, gratefully smiling, as he looks * at
the now utterly overcome captain, dies, in the lime-light, to slow
music, with his head reposing on that deeply affected officer's best
épaulette. In fact, a sort of nautical “Poor Jo.” But this idea is
utterly knocked over by the appearance of the real genuine stow-
away, who has such a sneaky, crawly, strangling-you-asleep ap-
pearance, that I own to a feeling of intense gratification on seeing
two men rowing a small boat up alongside (for which we slack off a
bit), while at the same moment the discomfited sneak with the
expensive, and still mysterious, umbrella, who has descended the
lowered gangway, stands on the shaky ledge below as if he were
about to take a plunge—which, indeed, he does; not, fortunately for
him, into the tidal river, but head foremost into the Šingy, where for
a second or two, he lies sprawling. Regaining his legs, he steadies
himself, and actually has the impudence to wave his hat to us by
way of bidding us farewell, and hoping we’ll have a good passage!
“And,” I ask of a sharp-looking little officer, who is superintending
the º of the ladder, “what will become of him? Can he
#. those boatmen?” “Heaven knows!” is the answer, and we
p the subject as we have already dropped the miserable object.
At the last he will have to give up that umbrella, worth quite a
guinea, in payment for being taken ashore. And then-. . . alas!
poor Job Trotter the Stowaway! ... I'm afraid a good seven years is in
store for him on some count or other; and, may be, that’s about the
best that can * to him.
The bugle-call. Bugle, sounded by mysterious person in plain
clothes, who, like myself, “comes out for a blow.” After this he is
"heard no more,” until, at six P.M., he sends out his notes “de
faire part,” i.e., to inform the company that it is time to dress for
dinner. At 6.30 he gives a good hearty blow out, cheerily announc-
ing the last meal of the day. Then he vanishes till next morning
at breakfast-time,
One o'clock.-Such a prodigal luncheon as is provided only on board
ship. Most appropriate name, “Liners.” At meal times, we are a
“liners,” and very}.g do we line. Only on board one hour,
and my appetite is Dominie Sampsonish, i.e., “predi-gi-ous!”
After lunch—with the essential Oriental curry—the necessary
cigar and coffee-cum-liqueur; we talk as we pace the deck up ard
down and round and round, occasionally stopping to remark on the
coast scenery, and to puzzle out the exact localities of the best
known places from Whitstable to Dover.
So passes a fine and most enjoyable afternoon; then more bugle,
capital dinner, band playing, lively conversation, cigars and coffee,
more pacing deck, storytelling, game of cards, music, piping (no
dancing), grogging, and so to bed at an earlyish hour, to sleep
soundly, undisturbed even by solos on the fog-horn which, I am
subsequently informed, were of frequent occurrence, until the polite
Commander of the Bath knocks at cabin door to inform me that it
is seven A.M., and that the warm sea bath awaits me.
I’appétit vient en baignant, and while walking the deck we grate-
fully welcome the bugler who bugles us to breakfast. We rush
down. False alarm! It is only the politeness of the bugler, who
beforehand, so that no one shall be taken ---- -
by surprise, gives us the note of warning, -
letting us know thereby that, in half-an-
hour, breakfast will be, so to speak, “under
weigh!” Fair start for all.
Nine A.M.–Lions feeding not in it with
us sea-dogs. What a breakfast! as if we
were not going to be within reach of food
for the next fortnight. . We are all taking
in stores hand over hand. -
Alas! when next the bugle sounds for ºf --
lunch we shall not be there! For, as the \ \º
clock strikes one, a tender from Plymouth Ş
arrives to fetch us, and in a pelting shower .
we leave the good º Qrctava, taking with us, our chief cheery
companion; and after bidding adieu to the other cheery companions
on board, we (a small party of three) take train from Plymouth
S. Devon, to Ilfracombe, N. Devon, traversing as pretty a line 0
country as is to be found in England. And so we begin our holiday,
and advise everyone to do likewise and enjoy the trip as much as we
did, and a holiday as much as we intend to do.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Tuesday, August 20, 2.18 A.M.–New Members,
and some who sat in last Parliament, have had opportunity to-night of
tasting old times at Westminster. As R., G. WEBSIER pointedly
observes, “TIM HEALY has drawn his shillelagh, and thrown away
the scabbard.” Here is House of 670 Members, in Session in obedience
to constitutional conditions. Must needs meet on 12th of August;
but every man, or nearly everyone, chiefly anxious to get necessary
business over as soon as possible, and so off to moor or sea, or quiet
home in long-severed country across the Irish Sea or bºyond the
Tweed. TIM HEALY has introduced Bill to amend Municipal
Franchise in Ireland; wants to carry it through, all its stages, and
send, it on to Lords before Prorogation. “Only a little one,” he
pleads. PRINCE ARTHUR points out if exception made in one case
will be claimed in others. Can't oblige TIM.
“Very well,” says the Implacable. One; “then see what it will
cost you. No Bill no holiday, at least not as long as I can stand on
floor and raise º voice.”...
All through the long sitting TIM been to the fore. No matter
what subject, it served for him to take objection, and in most cases
division. AttoBNEY-GENERAL wanted to take first reading Expirin
Laws Continuance Bill; a purely, formal procedure; a matter o
course at end of each Session. Tim objected. After vain protest,
ATToRNRY-GENERAL retired. PRINCE ARTHUR moved debate on
Limerick election should have particular place ºn Agenda. TIM
objected. . Such a course, he argued, implied that debate on the
dutiful address to most gracious *---
speech from the throne might
be interrupted in favour of any
ordinary business. In voice
faltering with emotion TIM re-
sented, this slight upon his
Sovereign. Next in enormity
was evidence discerned by his
keen vision of demoralising in-
fluence of HEMPRER Joe on
Conservative principles. Before
the fusion, Conservatives held
sacred all constitutional pre-
cedents. Now, with a light
heart, they proposed to flºut an
ordinance that had prevailed for
seven hutdred years.
Why seven hundred nobody
knew. TIM might have put it
at eight hundred or a thousand; V
but he is, above all things, a
moderate man.
SPEAKER ruled PRINCE AR-
THUR's procedure strictly in
order. SQUIRE OF MALwooD,
coming to rescue of Ministers,
admitted it was a course in-
variably taken under former
Ministry. TIM took his stand
on the British Constitution :
put his protecting arms round
his affronted Sovereign; de-
clined to budge, and the master
of many legions surrendered.
The same through long sit-
ting, which closes at this moment
with dawn surprising the blush-
ing East. On successive ques-
tions—the suspension of twelve
o'clock rule, the SPEAKER leaving

ut as yet we have nº Chairman. MELLOR's unrequited labours
closed with life of last Parliament. SARK always says justice never
done to MELLOR.
“A painstaking, upright, courteous gentleman,” he testifies.
“Much too good for obstruction's daily food in Chair of Committees.
If he had a fault tending to incapacitate him for Chair, it was the
extreme geniality of a nature that made him shrink from giving
ain. He came into office at an epoch of exceptional difficulty.
yon PLAYFAIR had bad time when he was hampered by well-
organised, ruthless obstruction led by PARNELL. Obstruction to
the Home-Rule Bill throughout first session of MELLob's chairman-
ship not less ably led, for Joe, not yet come to Imperial estate, was
much to the fore. It was certainly not less ruthless; numerically
was in treble force. . To obfusticate the Chairman was easiest,
most effective way of delaying progress of Bill through Committee;
MELLoR suff, red accordingly. The order of things should have
been reversed. Mellor
should come to Chair to-
day. Low THER should
have had his job in Session
of 1893. JAMEs W. is en-
dowed in marked degree
with the quality of phlegm
invaluable to Chairman in
troublous times. What
worried sensitive nature
of MELLoR would have
flurried him no more than
bucket of water cast over
a duck's back.”
“I was made a corporal
just in time,” said Private
HANBURY, musing over
recent turns in wheel of
fortune. “With JAMES W.

A have charge of the Esti-
mates than be engaged in

HERMon Hodge, after
enjoying the fresh air of
the country for three years,
comes back to House and
loftily complains of the
atmosphere. “Is the first
Commissioner of Works
aware,” he inquired, “that
in the early part of the
afternoon there was a most
horrible smell of drains at
the bar of the House?”
“Hoighty toighty!'” said
JoBN WILLIAM. “What

cular flavour that offends
his sensibilities : Is it whiskey or rum? Who is he that he should
interfere with the private tastes of hon. Members? To complain of
the smell of drains at the bar at a time when the British electorate
have, by overwhelming majorities, declared against any tampering
with The Trade interests, is too much from a man who has shared
in the benefit derived on our side by the wholesome current of
public opinion.”
Never saw John WILLIAM so put about. Usually brimming over
with good living and fine feeling.

FOR WHEEL OR WOE,
THE Rural District Council
at Chester resolved recently to
station men on the main roads
leading into the city to count
the number of cyclists, with a
view to estimating what re-
venue would accrue from a
cycle tax. Extremely high and
public-spirited of the Chester
authorities to take the matter
up. These dwellers by the
Dee ought to adopt as their
motto, “The wheel has come
full cycle.”
“Who Is SYLVIA P” – An
opera, from the pen of Dr.
JosłPH PARRY, the famous
Welsh composer, entitled
Sylvia, has been successfully
roduced at the CardiffTheatre
oyal. The libretto is by Mr.
FLETCHER and Mr. MENDELs-
SOHN PARRY, the maestro's
son, so that the entire produc-
tion is quite parry-mutuel.
THE RAII.WAY RACE.
A NEW British sport has arisen, or rather, has, after a seven years'
interval, been revived within the last week or so, and the British
sporting reporter, so well-known for his ready º of vivid and
- picturesque metaphor, has, as usual,
2- risen to the occasion. That large and
growing class of sedentary “sports-
men,” whose athletic proclivities are
confined to the perusal of betting news,
have now a fresh item of interest to
discuss in the performances of favourite
and rival locomotives. More power
has been added to the elbows of the
charming and vociferous youths, who
push their way through the London
streets with the too familiar cry of
“Win-nerr l’’ (which, by the way,
has quite superseded that of “Evening
Piper l’’), And the laborious persons
who assiduously compile “records”
have enough work to do to keep pace
with their daily Mº collection.
Even the mere “Man in the Street”
knows the amount of rise in the Sha
Fell and Potter's Bar gradients, thoug
É. if you cross-question him,
e could not tell you where they are.
However, the great daily and evening
papers are fully alive to the occasion
and the various rting “Majors’
and “Prophets” are well to the fore with such “pars” as the
following :-
Flying Buster, that smart and rakish yearling from the Crewe
stud, was out at exercise last evening with a light load of eighty
tons, and did some very satisfactory trials.

Invicta, the remarkably speedy East Coast seven-year-old, made
a very good show in her run from Grantham to York yesterday.
She covered the 80% miles in 78 minutes with Driver ToMKINs up
and a weight of some 120 tons, without turning a hair. She looked
extremely well-trained, and I compliment her owners on her
appearance. - - - - º
Really something ought to be done with certain of the Southern
starters. I will name no names, but I noticed one the other day
whose pace was more like thirty hours a mile than thirty miles an
hour. I have heard of donkey-engines, and this one would certainly
win a donkey race. º

These long-distance races are, no doubt, excellent tests for the
strength and stamina of our leading cross-country “flyers,” but I
must enter a protest against the abnormally early hours at which the
chief events are now being pulled off. A sporting reporter under-
goes many hardships for the good of the public, but not the least is
the disagreable duty of being in at the finish at Aberdeen, say
at 4.55 A.M. The famous midnight steeple-chase was nothing to it.
There was some very, heavy booking last night at Euston, and
Puffing Billy the Second was greatly fancied. He has much finer
action and bigger barrel than his famous sire, not to mention being
several hands higher. It is to be hoped that he will not turn out a
roarer, like the latter. -

“TWENTY MINUTES ON THE CONTINENT.”
(By Our Own Intrepid Explorer.)
“ITELL you what you want,” said my friend Saxon HURST. “You
find your morning dumb-bells too much for you, and complain of
weakness—you ought to get a blow over to France.” -
The gentleman who made the suggestion is a kind guardian of my
health. He is not a doctor, although I believe, he did “walk the
hospitals” in his early youth, but knows º what to advise.
- As a rule, when I meet him he pro-
- ses some far-a-field journey.
'What!” he exclaims, in a tone
of commiseration; “got a bad cold!
Why not trot over to Cairo P The
trip would do you worlds of good.”
I return: “No doubt it would, but
I havn't the time.” At the mere
suggestion of “everyone's enemy,”
RAxon HURST roars with laughter.
He is no slave to be bound by time.
He has º: out any number of
leasant little excursions that can
e carried out satisfactorily during
that period known to railway com-
panies (chiefly August and Septem-
ber) as “the week's end.” He has
discovered that within four-and-
twenty hours you can thoroughly
“do”, France, and within twice
*), that time make yourself abso-
lutely conversant with the greater
part of Spain. So when he tells me that I want “a blow over”
to the other side of the Channel, I know that he is proposing no
lengthy proceedings. -
** About twenty minutes or so on the continent will soon set you
to rights,” continues SAxon HURST, in a tone of conviction. “Just
you trust to the London, Chatham and Doyer Railway and they
will pull you through, Keep your eye on the 9 A.M. Express from
Victoria and you will never regret it.”
Further conversation proved to me that it was well within the
resources of modern civilization to breakfast comfortably in Belgravia
lunch sumptuously at Calais, and be back in time for a cup of
(literally) five o'clock tea at South Kensington. Within eight
hours one could travel to the coast, cross the silver streak twice, call
upon the Gallic douane, test the cuisine of the buffet attached to the
ôtel Terminus, and attend officially Mrs. ANYBody’s “last Any-
day.” It seemed to be a wonderful feat, and yet when I came to
perform it, it was as easy as possible.
There is no deception at 9 A.M., every º, at the Wictoria
Station. A sign-post points out the Dover Boat Express, and tells
you at the same time whether you are to have the French-flagged
services of the Invicta and the Victoria, or sail under the red ensign
of the Calais-Douvres. Personally, I prefer the latter, as I fancy it
is the fastest of the speedy trio. Near to the board of information is
a document heavy with fate. In it you can learn whether the sea is
to be “smooth,” “light,” “moderate,” or “rather rough.” If you
find that your destiny is one of the two last mentioned, make up
your mind for breezy weather, with its probable consequences. Of
course, if you can face the steward with cheerful unconcern in a
hurricane, you will have nothing to fear. But if you find it necessary
to take chloral before embarkin (say) on the Serpentine in a dead
calm, then beware of the trail of the tempest, and the course of the
coming storm; . If a man who is obliged to go on insists that “it
will be all right,” take care, and beware. “Trust him not,” as the
late Longfellow...poetically suggested, as it is quite within the
bounds of possibility that he may be “fooling thee.” But if the
meteorological report points to “set fair,” then away with all idle
apprehensions, and his for the first-class smoking compartment, that
stops not until it gets to Dover pier, for the pause at Herne Hill
scarcely counts for anything.
As you travel gaily along through the suburbs of Surrey and the
R; w
hops of Kent, you have just time to glance from your comfortable | I
cushioned seat at “beautiful Battersea,” “salubrious Shortlands,”
‘‘cheerful Chatham,” “smiling Sittingbourne,” “favoured (junction
for Dover, and Ramsgate). Faversham,” and last, but not least,
“cathedral-cherishing Canterbury.” ...You hurry through the quaint
old streets of “the Key to Brompton” (I believe that is the poetical
plus strategical designation of the most warlike of our cinque pºrts),
and in two twos you are on board the Calais-Douvres, bound for
the buffet...of buffets, the pride of the caterer's craft, or rather (to
avoid possible misapprehension) his honourable calling... The Channel
is charming. This marvellous twenty miles of water is as wayward
as a woman. At one time, it will compel the crews of the steamers
to appear in complete suits of oil-skin; at another it is as smooth
as a billiard-table, and twice as smiling. The report at Victoria
has not been misleading. We are to have a pleasant, and
consequently º passage.
On board I find a goodly, company of lunchers. . Mr. Recorder
BUNNY, Q.C., sedate and silent—once the terror of thieves of all
classes, and ruffians of every degree, now partly in retreat. Then
there is the MAcStorm, C.B., warrior and novelist. Foreign
affairs are represented by M.M. Box Hom MIE and DE CzARVILLE,
excellent fellows both, and capable correspondents in London. Then
there are a host of celebrities. DICKY HogaRTH, the caricaturist;
SAMUEL STEELE SHERIDAN, the dramatist; and SHAKSPEARE JoHN-
son CockAIGNE, the man of literary all-work.
“It is very fine this to me when therefore I exme out why,”
observes an Italian explorer, who has the reputation of speaking
ºtwenty languages fluently, and is particularly proud of his
ngllsn. - - -
• Certainly,” I answer promptly, because my friend is a little
irritable, and still believes in the possibilities of the duello.
“Therefore maybe you find º: when I am not placed which
was consequently forwards.” And with this the amiable explorer
from the sunny south, no doubt believing that he has been imparting
lººtion of the most valuable character, relapses into a smiling
811ence.
In the course of the voyage I find that, if I pleased, I could wait
until a quarter to four, and then return to my native shores. This
would give me more than three hours in Calais. But what should I
do with them P
“You might go to the Old Church,” says Mr. Recorder BUNNY,
Q.C., “which was an English place of worship in the time of Queen
MARY. Some of the chapels are still dedicated. to English Saints,
and there are various other memorials of the British occupation.”
“Or #. can go to the plage,” puts in the MACŞtoRM. , “Great
fun in fine weather. Whole families pic-nic on the sands. They
feed under tents or in châlets. In the water all day long, except at
meal-times. At night they retire, I think, to a little collection of
timber-built villas, planted in a neatly-kept square. The whole thing
rather suggestive of ALEXANDER SELKIRK plus an unlimited supply
of a quarter-inch deal flooring, canvas, and cardboard.”
In spite, however, of the unrivalled attractions of Calais, I deter-
mine to go no further than the buffet. Acting
under the instructions of Mr. Recorder BUNNY,
Q.C., who seems to know the ropes thoroughly well,
I allow the “goers on” (passengers bound, for
Paris and the Continent generally) to satisfy their
cravings for food, and then give my orders. A waiter,
who has all the activity of his class, representing,
let us say, the best traditions of the Champs Élysée,
takes me in hand. We make out a menu on the spot
—Melon, tete de veau di la vinaigrette, caneton aur
etits pois, and a cheese omelette. Then half a
ttle of red wine, a demi-syphon, and a café and
chasse. All good. Then the garçon skips away,
placing knives and forks at this table, a dish of fruit
at that, and a basket of bread at the one yonder.
These athletic exercises (that are sufficiently, en-
couraging to promise the performer—if he wishes
it—a prosperous career on the lofty trapeze), are -
undertaken in the interests of the :*:: voyagers Albion bound:
Before the arrival of the Paris train, I have eaten my lunch, settled
my bill (moderate), and taken my deck chair on the good steamer
that is to carry me back to my native land.
Ah! never shall I forget the dear old shores of England, as I
watch them after déjeuner a la fourchette through the perfumed
haze of an unusually good cigar... “Low capped and turf crowned,
they are not a patch upon the wild magnificence of the fierce Aus;
tralian coast line, but in my eyes they are beautiful beyºnd
compare.” I remember that at one time or another I have heard “the
finest music in the world, but at that moment there comes 8 g
into my ears a melody worth all that music put together, the
chime of English village bells.” I recollect that I have heard these
beautiful expressions used in the Garrick Theatre on the occasion of
the revival of a certain little one-act piece. , Mr. ARTHUR BOUCHIEF
was then eloquent (on behalf of the author) in praise of Dºver, and
now agree with him. What can be more beautiful than the white
cliffs of Albion and the sound of English village bells—after a capital
º," Calais, and during the enjoyment of an unusually good
Clſºar
he trusty ship gets to England at 2.30, the equally trusty train
arrives at Wictoria a couple of hours later. I am in capital time for
Mrs. ANYBody’s “last Anyday.” - -
“How well you are .# observes my kind hostess, pouring
out a cup of tea.
“And I am feeling well,” I return; “and all this good health I
owe to twenty minutes on the continent.” -
And these last words sound so like the tag to a piece that they
shall serve (by the kind permission of the British public) as the title
and the end to an article.

SCRAPS FROM CHAPS.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-My pater reads the Bristol newspapers, but I
don't, because there’s never any º or red indians in them, but
happening to look in one the other day I noticed an awfully good
thing. It said that at a place called Stapleton all the parents were
yery indignant at the way in which the schoolmistress had been
treated by the manigers, and to show their symperthy they decided to
keep their children from school. The school was nearly empty in
consequents. Now I don’t think my schoolmaster has half º
sympathy shown him. He does know how to cane, certainly, but he
isn't really such a beast as fellows make out—at least not just, the
day or so before the holidays *:::. would you mind telling
}.; that they ought to keep their boys at home for a week or a
... after next term begins, to show how much they sym se
with him P. Poor chap, he has lots of trouble-I know he has,
because I give him some. Yours respekfully, Bloggs JUNIOR.
BAWBEES THANKFULLY RECEIVED.—A National Scottish Memorial
to BURNS is in the Ayr. “Surely,” writes a perfervid one, “BURNs
did as much for our country and the world as Scott, yet how ve
different the monuments of the two in Edinburgh and Glasgow I
am sure nº Scotchman would grudge his mite, however poort, ºr such
a purpose.”. Quite so. But it would take a good many “Cotter's
Saturday, mites”, to build anything like the Scott Memorial in
Princes Street. And what is this that the Rev. Dr. BURRELL, of
New York, said in presenting a new panel for the Ayr statue of
BURNs from American lovers of the poet? ... “The stream of
pilgrims,” he observed, “from America to the banks of the Doon
was twice as large as that which found its wº to the banks of the
Avon.” Then why should not the stream of dollars follow, and
erect a colossal “Burns. Enlightening the Nations” somewhere
down the Clyde-say, at the Heads of Ayr P. Hamlet beaten by Tam
O'Shanter, and Avon taking a back seat to Doon! Flodden is,
indeed, avenged.
The WEARING O'THE GREEN.—There was a discussion at the Cork
Corporation's meeting on a recommendation of the Works Committee,
that “a new uniform, of Irish manufacture, be ordered for the hall-
porter.” What should be the colour, was the difficulty? “Some
members,” we regret to read, “were in favour of blue”; and then
the debate went on thus—
Mr. BIBLE he thought they should stick to the green
Mr. FARINGtoN said that green uniforms rot;
Mr. Lucy denounced such a statement as mean,
And—“never change colour!”—advised Sir John Scott.
So the hall-porter will have a uniform of “green and gold”—the
green to be “durable,” and the gold to make it endurable I

“No, THANks.
BEST MUSIC THERE is 1”
I'M QUITE HAPPY As I AM.
To TELL You The truth, I PREFER THE worst possiblE ConVERSATION TO THE
LA BELLE DAME SANS MERCI.
A BALLAD of BIRD SLAUGHTER.
(With Apologies to the Shade of Keats.)
“The new style of women's head-gear—callel
mixed plumes—threatens to add the extermination
of Birds of Paradise to that of several species of
herons. . . . It is for this “use’ that whole heron-
ries in Florida and elsewhere have been utterly
destroyed; it is for this that Birds of Paradise are
being persecuted even to extinction.”—Mrs. E.
Phillips, Vice-President of the Society for the
Preservation ºf Birds.]
I.
OH,what can ail thee, poet-man,
Alone and palely #;"; ?
“The wings are banished from the woods,
And no birds sing.”
II.
Oh, what can ail thee, bird-lover,
So haggard and so woe-begone?
“The heronry no more is full,
And the cranes are flown.”
III.
I see there's sorrow on thy brow,
At dawn's rose-flush, at eve's cool dew.
“Bird-song is gone from the garden rose,
And the field flowers too.
IV.
“I met a lady on the way
Fell, beautiful, cold Fashion's child;
Her hair was golden, her plume was high,
And her eyes were wild.
W.
“She made a mixed plume for her head,
Of heron crest and aureole.
She looked at me as void of love,
And cold of soul.
WI.
“She slaughtered Birds of Paradise,
And little cared for all day long
Save silencing the whirr of wings,
And the trill of song.
WII.
“She found the task of relish sweet;
The warbling wildwood choir she slew.
Till the larks were mute, and the linne's
e º
And the robins few.
VIII.
“She took me to her milliner's
And showed with glee a sight full sore,
Her new mixed plume, with aureoles six,
And egrets four.
IX.
“'Twas there she lulled all love asleep,
And her heart grew hard-ah, woebetide!-
As the granite-boulder that gleameth white
On the cold hill-side.
X.
“I saw dead songsters heaped to view.
From field, wood, mere, came one sad call:
They cried, ‘La Belle Dame sans Merci
Will slay us all!”
XI.
“Beauty no more will flash a-wing,
Music no more full-throated flush.
Fashion will curse the fields of Spring
With the Winter's hush.
XII.
“I saw }. bird-beaks in that room
With fruitless warning gaping wide;
And the lady wore their stolen plumes
With a cruel pride.
XIII.
“‘The Feathered Woman” was she hight;
But all reproof, compassion-born, .
The modish Belle Dame sans Merci
Doth laugh to scorn.
XIV.
“What plea for beauty or for song,
Or simple prudence, may she reck,
While Fashion rules she with mixed plumes
Her head must deck?
XW.
“The birds in myriads may die,
Till earth is all a songless hush;
But she upon her crest must sport
A feathered-brush |
XVI.
“'Tis not sore need bids songsters bleed,
Not lack of vesture or of food;
'Tis only Fashion's foolish freak
Strips wold and wood.
XVII.
“And that is why I wander here,
Alone and sadly loitering, - plume,
Whilst the sedge, shakes not with glancing
And no birds sing !”
Bouhn E.MoUTH's chief magistrate, by deci-
sion and order of the corporation of that
town, has been deprived of a strip of land
alleged to be public property, which he had
enclosed within his own private grounds.
The sight of sixty workmen ruthlessly “re:
moving his summer-house and shrubs, and
throwing tons of mould over the cliffs,” could
not have been a very exhilarating one for
the erstwhile owner, who must have felt like
Mayor-ius 'mid the ruins of Cart-hage.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
* ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
“Roundabout Ridings” would be the more correct title, for he
who writes these lines has yielded to the joint influences of the
prevalent craze and the glorious weather, and has been touring in
North Devon on (and off) a bicycle. I say “off” advisedly, for the
hills in that delightful country are so numerous, so long, and so
steep, that out of every hundred miles you accomplish you will find
that you have walked at least fifty while you painfully shoved your
wheel before you. And when you reach the laborious summit an
pause panting, you are as likely as not to gather your breath and
strength under a notice informing you that the descent beyond,
. º you had hoped to spin with extended legs, is dangerous
o cyclists.
AND thereupon, if the sun is shining in full strength, and §
are spent and parched, you may possibly
decide that in order to make a bicycle
tour in North Devon a complete and
Z splendid success, it is essential that you
/ should do it without a bicycle. . But
later on, when you have reached the
end of your journey, have had your
bath, your rub down and your brus
up, and are waiting placidly for your
dinner with an appetite well set and a
thirst calculated to drain a vat of cider,
- then you will realise that even in the
precipitous Devolshire country bicycling is a real delight.
PUTTING aside for the moment the question whether, or not you
ought to take a bicycle, I hold that the following ingredients go to
make a successful bicycle tour. (1) A tall youngster from Oxford
º: incalculable yards of totally irresponsible arms and legs, a
happy knack of conversational prattle, a, shock of fair hair, and
imperturbable good humour. These details, though important, are
not essential. It is, however, absolutely essential that he should
make all F. for the day's ride, settle on the stopping places and
hotels, and carry maps and guide-books, You can then enjoy the
satisfaction of abusing him heartily whenever º: go wrong.
You will also find that whenever you want the map he will either
have left it in the pocket of a coat which has been sent on by train,
or stowed it away in the darkest recess of the bottom of his kit-case.
THE second ingredient is a private clown of quaint humour and
original ideas. This is the sort of man who finds interest and
amusement in everything, and provokes you to laughter by the
most unexpected sallies. Before you have had time to turn round
he will be on terms of easy familiarity with drivers of coaches,
porters at hotels, ladies who serve behind bars, and rustics whom he
may meet on the road. In five minutes he knows the details of all their
personal history, their length of service, the manner of their work,
the size of their families, their adventures, and their chief desires in
life. They all treat him with the highest, consideration and go out
of their way to make things easy for him. At Lynton our own
particular clown sent the hotel band into convulsions by dancing a
step dance while they were solemnly playing a German march. The
incongruity of the situation so tickled the trombone that for at least
two minutes he was utterly unable tº carry on the pumping opera-
tions entailed by his instrument. His ruin was completed when he
was asked to join our party with the special object of inflating the
back-tyres of our bicycles. Even the conductor relaxed into a smile.
THE third ingredient is a paymaster. If you, an
find a handsome, well-built, agreeable and intellec-
tual man for the position (as we did) so much the
better... You will thus add an air of character and
distinction to your tour. In that respect, I admit,
we were fortunate beyond the average. ineed only
add, as a slight reminder to my companions, that
they have not yet repaid to me the money I dis.
bursed for them.
THe fourth ingredient is one i. day. It helps
you to enjoy the fine weather, all the more, and it
gives you an opportunity of investing, yourself in
the#. little gray waterproof cape which bicycle
outfitters provide for wet weather. From a ticket
attached to the collar of mine, I discovered that it
was called an “electric poncho.” I can only say
that it fully deserved the title. Wet weather, more-
over, adds a º element of uncertainty to bicycling by making
your back wheel skid, so that you never know, from one moment to
the other, what you may be doing. If three of you are riding in a
h|frowns of the bald man by his dashing exploits in the
line, it is more than probable that, in the twinkling of an eye, you
will be piled three deep on the side of the road.
You ought also to insure at least one hotel dance in the course of
your journey. , All hotel dances are the same, and therefore one is
quite sufficient as a sample. , Hotel dances are attended by eight
ladies and six men. One of the men is a boy. He has two sisters,
who are also present at the dance. He dances three times with
one sister, and three times with the other. His seventh dance he
d|devotes to a lady no longer in her first youth, who has captured
his young affections, and after the mad excitement of this episode
he goes to bed. Another of the men is always elderly,
bald, and stout. He displays the courtl antr
which is understood to be an attribute of the old schoo
He is a rigorous stickler for the etiquette of the ball-
room. He dances the Lancers with a solemn precision Aº
and the waltz with a precise solemnity, and that is the ſk
only distinction he makes between them. He is a W
great hand at well-turned compliments of a ponderous
nature, and it is a liberal education to see him con-
ducting his º * : Nº. A third º:
an annul rattle. He makes his partners giggle by
his * orance of the Lancers, and incurs the
waltz. The ladies all wear high dresses, they have
interchangeable chaperons, and make a noble pretence of enjoying
themselves. In the fifth dance the bald man falls down, and long
i. ºve o'clock everything is over and peace reigns again in
e no
ssessor, not merely of the steepest High
Street in the world, but also of a “poet-artist” (so he describes him-
self), who is also (I again ". his own description) a “professional
qualified photographer.” Here is an extract from his enthusiastic
poem entitled "A Peep from the Hobby Drive, Clovelly.”
How charming is the old High Street,
Pitched with pebbles, rough—how steep ;
There donkeys stand with coal and sand,
And women with their brush in hand.
Out boldly stands the grand old pier,
To check the waves that may come near;
And fishermen upon it stand
Yarning with their pipes in hand.
Among such grandeur, artist, rest–
To imitate it at thy best:
For should some beauty fall to ground,
Thy picture has it, safe and sound.
CLovELLY is the proud
FROM the Fishing Gazette I take the following story:—
Last spring, while a party of tourists were fishing up North, a well-known
lawyer lost his gold watch from the boat in which he was sitting. Last
week he made another visit to the lakes, and during the first day's sport
caught an 81b. trout. His astonishment can be imagined when he found the
watch lodged in the throat of the trout... The watch was running, and the
time correct. . It being a “stem winder,” the supposition is that, in masti-
cating its food, the fish wound up the watch daily.
I happen to know
that this story is
incomplete, and I
venture to add some
missing details. The
fish—a particularly
thoughtful animal
—finding that there
was no chain to the
watch, resolved to -
* this defect,
and, by a well-
known process in
metallurgy, con-
We some of its
scales into a com-
plete Albert, which
it. connected with
the watch. The ---. - -
watch used to lose two minutes a week. With admirable patience
the fish regulated it, and restored it, to its owner in perfectly
accurate trim. When it was originally lost, the watch. was, a
simple one. It has now become a repeater, with a special dial indi-
cating the days of the week, the month, and the year A.D. By 3
trick, learnt from a fried whiting in early life, this trout contrived
every day to insert its tail into its mouth, and, by using it as a brush,
to keep #. watch clean, and free from rust. When the fish had been
boiled and eaten, the watch stopped, out of sympathy, and has not
gone since.

A PIECE FULL OF POINT.
MEssrs. CLEMENT Scott and BRANDoN THoMAs are to be congratu-
lated on the success of their adaptation of the Maître d'Armes, pro-
duced at the Adelphi Theatre on Saturday last. The play, which
appeared, like the longest remembered dramas of the late Dion Bouci-
cAULT, in August—traditionally “the dead season of the stage”—
seems destined to be as ºl. as the best-liked of its predecessors.
For once—but, it is to be hoped, not “and away”—Mr. WILLIAM
TeRRIss has a chance of showing his quality in a character
worthier of his powers than the customary hero of “walking gentle-
man” romance. Like Mr. HENRY Neville when he appeared as
Henry Dunbar, after a long course of Ticket of Leave Man,
Mr. TERRIss makes the most of his opportunity. Miss MILLwaRD
is excellent as the child of the fencer—a criticism which applies
equally “to every one concerned.” Well written, well ºt. and
well played, there is no reason why. The Swordsman's Daughter
should not prove the truth of heredity and “run through’’—the
season.
“FULL of wise saws” is “Amateur Angler,” in the Fishing Gazette,
concerning the river Wye. He complains that “he tried for trout,
but caught chub,” which, however, we are told “is a comely fish”
—quite chub-stantial, doubtless—and “gives as much sport, at
times, as a gentlemanly trout.” “Lordly salmon” are also to be
found. Evidently the Wye is peopled by the upper crust of the
piscatorial world, and this, perhaps, explains the reason for “the
river being netted and poached in every conceivable way,” or wye,
as Cockneys say.
WITH sorrow we read, in the South Wales Daily News, the
announcement of the demise of “Billy,” the celebrated goat, that
for ten years had been an honoured and favourite member of the
First Battalion, Welsh Regiment. This excellent animal, who died
from the ravages of rheumatism contracted on the march, seems to
have belonged to the "giddy” species of goat, for we learn that “he
could hold his own with the best in drinking stout, beer, wine, or
spirits.” With these Anti-Local Veto propensities, it would not
have been astonishing had, the bibulous “Billy,” like a certain
historical personage, met with his end by drowning in a butt.

schools will soon be founded for teaching wit and politeness,
after my scheme, to young º: of quality and fortune.”
Mr. Neverout. Perhaps the present rage for dialogues is the
first step in that direction,

“AND THAT CONFOUNDED MAN SOLD
THE INTERESTING CASE OF MR. BRIEFLESS.
I HAVE been requested by a large number of the profession to
which I have the honour to belong, to bring a matter of some per-
sonal importance before the public in an appropriate manner. It
seems to me that I cannot carry out this instruction more judiciously
than by Qommunicating with the Editor of a paper representing by
universal consent the Bench, the Bar, and the Populace. I am
assisted in this task-one of considerable delicacy—by a document
that came into my hands at a time when the scheme, now full grown,
was in its infancy. It is a note from “Mr. Senior,” who presided at
my mess in Hall some weeks before the commencement of the present
Long Wacation. It speaks for itself:—
“MY DEAR BRIEFLEss, - In , reply to your letter, ‘No,... I
certainly was not joking... It is true that we four had got to the
third bottle of our after-dinner port; but in that admission I see no
reason for assuming that our intellectual faculties had failed us.
No; I shall be only too Fº if the proposed Testimonial should
become an accomplished fact. To put it tersely, if Athletics are to be
rewarded, why should Learning wait? Yours sincerely, y
I purposely omit the signature—an influential one—as I have no
desire to bring undue pressure to bear in a cause so purely personal
to myself. I need scarcely say that a Testimonial, even when it
takes the shape preferred by Mr. Micawber, is highly gratifying. But
when the matter was first broached, I had seriºus doubts whether i
would maintain the dignity of the Bar if I became a party to the pro-
ceedings, that would bring it to a successful issue. This being so, I
have little hesitation in laying before you this case and opinion. The
first—at request—was prepared by myself; the latter was appended
by a Counsel whose name, if revealed, would carry great weight, not
only with lawyers but the community at large.
CASE,
It is proposed to give Mr. A. BRIEFLEss, Jun., a Testimonial,
which it is intended shall take the shape of a bag of money, in con-
sideration of his services to the Bar. It is in contemplation that this
money shall be collected from the human race in general, and the
British public in particular. It may be suggested—not that the
contention has as yet arisen—that there is something derogatory in
a Barrister-at-Law receiving pecuniary assistance from persons other
than those of his kith and kin. Mr. A. BRIEFLEss, Jun., although
enjoying a very considerable practice as things go—he has held no
less than three consent briefs during the last five years—is not very
wealthy, and it must be admitted that a grant would not be an un-
welcome incident in his career. For all that he would shrink from
doing anything that might be considered derogatory to his title of
“esquire”—a distinction that he not only holds as his father's heir,
but by the usage of his office. . .
You are requested therefore kindly to say—l, .. -
1. Can Mr. A. BRIEFLEss, Jun., receive a Testimonial of a bag of
money without laying himself open to the charge of being an acces-
sory before and after the fact of an act of maintenance? .. -
2. Assuming that there is nothing in the first suggestion, will
Mr. A. BRIEFLEss, Jun., in accepting the sum of money it is pro-
sed to hand to him, be guilty of an act of contributory negligence,
§ about a loss of dignity to the Barf - - - -
3. Should there be nothing in the latter suggestion, is it desirable
that, instead of a bag of money, the Testimonial should take the
shape of a golden snuff-box, a service of plate, or some equally j
article?. It is strongly urged that, if practicable, this course shoul
not be advised, as such articles are invariably embarrassing.
And to consult and advise generally.
OPINION.
I do not think that the reception of a bag of money, by Mr. A.
BRIEFLEss, Jun., would amount to maintenance. But it would be
advisable that the learned gentleman should undertake not to use
any of the sum in defraying costs.
As the ancient manner of paying counsel was to drop an honora-
rium into the bags worn at the back of their robes, I can see
nothing derogatory to the profession in Mr. A. BRIEFLEss, Jun.,
accepting the proposed Testimonial. -
I #. not see that a distinction can be drawn between coins of the
realm and their equivalent. Both are equally acceptable. If Mr.
A: BRIEFLEss, Jun., prefers cash to snuff-boxes, there is, no reason
why he should not receive the former in preference to the latter.
I would advise that the Testimonial be collected at once, and pre-
sented as quickly as possible. (Signed) —,
I have nothing further to say beyond hinting that the project_h
already been taken up with a fair amount of enthusiasm. . Many
firms of manufacturers have expressed a desire to send subscriptions
(which they wish to see published in the daily papers) on the score
“ that they have been happy enough never to have had cause to avail
themselves of my valuable professional services.” . . .
And now I must º: for so lengthy a contribution., I have
nothing to add, save that should a Testimonial be organised, I shall
be glad were the subscriptions fixed at £13s.6d. Out of that sum
I should, of course, deduct half-a-crown as an appropriate recog-
nition of the services of my admirable and excellent clerk, Mr.
PoRTINGTON. (Signed) A. BRIEFLESS, JUN.

TORR-RESTIAL NOTES.
Happy Thought.—Ilfracombe, just now. If it be a question of
“Ways and Means,” then Ilfracombe offers you “the ways” in the
matter of drives, walks,
rides, excursions by
rail, by sea, likewise by
river and road almostad
infinitum, and some-
times by sea ad nau-
seam. Sea - bathing
naturally excellent, but
T still open, considerably
open, to improvement.
- Still, as the man of no
politics replied, when
asked why he belonged
to the Reform Club,
“There is in this world
- - nothing so good but
what it is capable, of improvement,” and Ilfracombe cannot claim
exemption from this rule of universal application... Should an
lfracombe-ination require suggestions, mine are at the service of
the I. I. C. (Ilfracombe Improvement Committee).
- -
On a bench at the summit of the Torrs sat three Elders. Gray-
bearded and full of confidence in their own, wisdom. On another
bench facing them sat a cherry-cheeked maiden, of some nineteen
summers, evidently an elder sister in charge of a little brother, with
whom in a shy sort of way, as if old enough to know better, and yet
unable to resist the temptation, she was sharing, with very evident
relish, some succulent toffy recently extracted from one of the man
“penny-in-the-slot” machines, which, as “bits of colour,” are suc
brilliant ornaments to the Torrs Walks, and such universal favourites
with youth of all ages...The three Elders were discoursing on the
mysteries of creation, with such a “cock-sureness” of tone as seemed
to imply that they themselves had been on some committee of manage-
ment, when the first idea of making this particular planet, called the
world, had occurred to its Creator. “These rocks,” said one grandly;
“were in existence long before the date assigned to the creation.”
Whereat the toffy-sucking, girl sniggered foolishly as if somehow
personally implicated, while the boy stared, open mouthed, with
toffy, yet untasted, in his dexter hand. *N. one,” observed the
second Elder, blandly, his eyes on the maiden,_not by any means
a SUSANNA but rather a fairly educated AwDREY,-"no one now
accepts the Mosaic account of Creation as given in Genesis.” . The
§ looked up, inquiringly, at his sister. The § giggled bash-
fully as if, in presence of so much learning and such reverend seniors,
she were suddenly somewhat ashamed of the home-teaching she had
received, and in which her trust had never been shaken, at least
until this minute. The third Elder, his eye too on the girl and boy,
–and perhaps the toffy, now joined in. “It was absurd,” quoth
he, supremely, “to believe that this.”—here with a wave of his hand
he took in air, earth..sky, and all the points of the compass—“was
made in six days.” Then both boy and girl sniggered at one another.
“I suppose, they teach you, that all this,” said the third Elder,
straightly addressing the girl, and again explaining his allusion, to
the universe by waving his right hand about with an all-embracing
gesture, “that, this was made in six days, eh?” With a demure
and silly giggle the damsel admitted that her education on the
subject had tended in the direction indicated. The three Elders
regarded one another with a sad, despondent air, as though here
were another case of crass ignorance which they had a special mission
to enlighten. “Why,” said the second Elder, “the Chinese”—here
the little, boy became suddenly interested—“the Chinese possess
records which reach back to a date anterior, by some thousands of
years, to that popularly assigned by Christians to the creation of the
world.” The girl opened her eyes, but the boy, having lost his sud-
denly awakened interest in the Chinese (probably he had expected
some stories about the war with Japan, or another tale of Aladdin),
had resumed histoffy-sucking process. At this point my companion,
who had been fidgetting on our bench, suddenly cut in and took a
hand. “You remind me, Sir,” said he, quite pleasantly, speakin
to the second Elder, but addressing all three, “of the ancient an
royal Irish family of Q'Toole, whose records, as you will of course
remember, went back for some millions of years; and in which, at a
comparatively late date, occurred the famous entry, N.B.-About
this time the world was created.’”. As this was told with perfect
good humour, and with an inimitably comic imitation of a brogue,
the damsel and boy were greatly amused, and the Three Wise Men
looked as black as the trio of Anabaptists in Le Prophète when
there is a danger of the truth being told by Fides, as to Jean of
Leyden being no heaven-descended prophet but only her common-
place peasant-born son, So girl and boy departed, laughing, to
gather more sweets, and º: to recount at home the Irish story,
which, thank heaven, is more likely to dwell in their memory than

Wise Men of the Mountain.

Beware of taking too much of the cream of Devon. “Is it possible
to take too much?' asks my friend, and companion, to whom half a
und of it at breakfast, another half-pound at lunch, and a third at
inner, are but as a dozen natives, at a single sitting, to a champion
devourer of bivalves, I cannot resolve my friend's question. But,
after emulating, as far as my limited powers would permit me, his
excellent example, I had the following curious dream. For particu-
lars, see next paragraph. -
+ +
The Dream.—I was seated º a lady, popular alike in the
social and political world, whom I will designate as “Lady JAY.”
It was at a dinner-party, I think, though it might have been some
other sort of entertainment, as there seemed tº me to be, between
Lady JAY and myself, the narrow width of a very long table, the
ends of which were out of sight. This table was covered with a
white cloth, not too clean; and there were no knives, forks, plates,
or dishes. The room was inconveniently crowded by persons, inex-
tricably mixed up, none of whom, however, incom-
moded us in the least, or, indeed, seemed to take
the slightest notice of our presence. Somehow, this
struck me as delicate conduct on their part. Lady
JAY was insisting that an Archimandrite could, or a
could not, do something or other officially. But,
having more than once demonstrated to Lady JAY
that this act, whatever it was, had no essential
bearing on his clerical position, I continued to take
very slight interest in the discussion; at least, I
thought I did not, until, on Lady, JAY suddenly
becoming dreadfully in earnest, and most positive a
as to her being in the right, a Whip of the late 4
Government, whose name I could not recall, but
with whose lineaments. I was perfectly familiar, -
interposed some conciliatory remarks. Then Mr. GLADSTJNR, in
the absence, unaccountably sudden, of both Lady, JAY and, the
Government Whip, strode up and down on the hearth-rug, rubbing
the back of his head with his left hand; whereupon I became aware
that we were no º: wherever I had been until the #. arance of
Mr. GLADston E on the scene, but that we were in the library of the
prime Minister's official residence in Downing Street. I was seated
in an odd sort of spider-legged arm-chair. Mr. GLADSTONE, bringing
himself to a halt, turned round, and asked me, pointedly, “Whether
I could play the piano.”
Being rather nettled at the 'tone of this
inquiry, which seemed to imply a doubt of my º: as a pianist,
I replied, somewhat testily, “Certainly; rather better than BEET:
Hoven.” Apparently satisfied with my answer, Mr. GLADSTONE said
that “if I would ob i: him by not çontinuing my discussion with
Lady JAY, in which I had been,” he admitted, “absolutely right”—
and here he made some facetious allusion as to ladies in general, of
which I could not catch one word—"I should,” he went on, “ have
a seat in the Cabinet.” Oddly enough, this offer of his did not strike
me as anything so very extraordinary; and I at once replied, “No,
thank you, I'd rather not.” But Mr. GLADSTONE would take no
refusal; he said, “I have come to a decision on this subject,” and
then * disappeared, through the wall. Whether it was a few
minutes, or hours, afterwards, I could not for the life of me deter-
mine, being only conscious of sometime having elapsed, before I found
myself in anavenueonthe Bayswater side of HydePark, walking up and
down with Mr. John MoRLEY. Our conversation there was, I suppose,
on the subject of Bulgaria, as this topic was continued by us in a kind
of narrow box-room, with hat-pegs on the walls, on which bathing-
towels were suspended; there were also trunks on the floor, and
school-desks all about, on one of which Mr. MoRLEY rested his elbow,
swaying himself backwards and forwards like a pendulum, while
always talking to me (I was seated on a box), and uttering platitudes

about Bulgaria; I interrupted him by saying curtly, “It is no use
talking to me like that, as I am in the Cabinet.” Mr. John MoRLEY
was staggered; but, recovering himself, he turned to HERBERT
§Akosº (to whom Tapologised for not remembering his title, while
he, sitting on a smaller box, smilingly refused to enlightenme), and
asked for corroboration of my statement. Whereupon I produced
a? º letter of Mr. GLADSTONE's to me, which entirely satisfied
Mr. JoHN MoRLEy, who, having handed it to HERBERT GARDNER,
now candidly disclosed the schemes of the Government on the subject
in question, putting forcibly before me “how we are going to deal
with Bulgaria.” Not a single word of what he said could I under-
stand. Still, as a member of the Cabinet, I felt, bound to give his
explanations my gravest attention, my difficulty being not to expose
my hopeless ignorance by any º: question. It was with
some new-born sense of importance that I found we were once again
in Lady JAY's company, this time in her drawing-room, and seated
in a low chair, while John MoRLEY had brought with him the school-
desk, ºn which he was still leaning his elbow, and still swaying and
swinging like a pendulum. Lady JAY was aii for resuming her dis-
cussion about the Archimandrite, refusing to credit the assurances
given by Mr. MoRLEY (balancing himself on his elbow) and myself as
to my being in the Cabinet secrets. At this point rushed in someone,
who was alternately HERBERT GARDNER and a Ponsonby, until he
settled down into being HERBERT GARDNER for certain, who
exclaimed excitedly, “I have just seen Mr. GLADSTONE!. He says,
“It is absurd to suppose that his letter ever meant anything of the
sort.''” I quietly demanded the restoration of Mr. GLADSTONE's
letter to me; so did Mr. JoHN MoRLEY. The protean representative
of HERBERT GARDNER or Ponson BY, or anybody else, replied simply
“I haven't got it.” This seemed to perfectly satisfy everybody, an
no further questions being forthcoming, Lady JAY seized the oppor-
tunity to declare triumphantly, addressing me personally-John
MoRLEY, and the protean representative having disappeared-how
the had “ascertained from a Cardinal that”. . . ; But what was
the solution of the difficulty, or what was the original difficulty itself
I shall never know in this world, though I may do so in the World
of Dreams, as here I awoke, and was so impressed with the reality
of the events that had passed, and with, the present necessity for
recording them, that I at orce entered them in my note-book, and
here they are.

“HAIL, divinest. Melancholy!” Decidedly the town of Penarth
must adopt this Miltonian line as its motto. At a meeting of the
Public Works Committee of the District Council, a letter was read
in which a citizen complained bitterly of the frivolous name given to
the street wherein he had his habitation, Gay Street! , How too
shocking ! “The whole neighbourhood objected to it,” and not even
the assurance that the thoroughfare had merely been thus designated
out of compliment to a noble lady of the locality, whose Christian
name was." Gay,” served to allay the righteous ind tion. Away
with the demoralizing, title and the base insinuation borne with it!
It was proposed that the street—being in the vicinity of All Saints-
be known for the future as “Amen Corner,” a name suitable to the
unswerving sobriety and solemnity of the city. The proposal was
put to the vote and carried with only a couple of dissentients, Is it
possible that there are even two Penarthians in favour of gaiety?

himself up in a cage in the tropical forests, to study the language

company's never-failing service, on the “constant supply” system.
Sir John Linger, Humph! An East-end fishmonger's comment
might throw some light on that subject, Colonel.
Lady Sparkish. Well, Sir John, we must admit that the growth
of Science keepspace with the spread of Stupidity. So doubtless the
time will soon come when pocket-phonographs will obviate the neces-
sity of individual vocal efforts, and leavemento give undivided atten-
tion to their dinners, matrons to their daughters' marriage-chances,
maidens to the marriageable men, and marriageable men to their–
moustaches!
Mr. Neverout. Unless, indeed, when we know all we shall be
silent about everything.

or second. Of the Seven #: of Man-I say nought about Woman,

A BATTLE IN A SODA-WATER BOTTLE,
IT appears that the enterprising commanders of the Royal Artillery
stationed at Dover have recently been getting themselves disliked by
the members of the National Alliance of Mineral Waters Associa-
tions (Limited), by producing gaseous waters at the canteen under
their control, and offering them for sale to their comrades in garrison.
According to a story laid before the Secretary of State for War, the
representatives of the scientific branch of the army in question have
had dealings with the gallant West Surrey and the equally gallant
West Riding, much to the disgust of the trading producers of non-
alcoholic compounds. The 3rd Battalion of the King's Qwn Rifle
Corps (late 60th) are also at Dover, but there is no evidence to
show that these warriors have preferred “R. A. ačrateds” to
brands as yet better known to the consumers of ºffervescing
drinks. According to the Daily Telegraph, this labour, savouring
more of peace than of war, enabled the controllers of the cannon to
contribute some £40 in prizes to the garrison sports held at Dover on
Saturday last. Whether the financial game was worth the athletic
candle is a matter that must be decided by military experts, quali-
fied to weigh, the respective advantages of burning “villainous
saltpetre” and preparing that exhilarating liquid, known amongst
civilians as "fizzle.” Admittedly, lemonade and its companion
“ginger pop” when they scintillate are grateful drinks, but it would
scarcely be advisable if through the no doubt, well intentioned efforts
of those concerned, the Royal Artillery gained an equally appropriate
but less impressive designation. It would indeed be a sad thing if it
ever became necessary for some General to have to sing out, “Here,
you Sir, in command of those Royal Ginger Popgunners, limber up
your soda-water manufacturing apparatus and retire at the gallop to
the canteen in the rear!”, Such a direction, if delivered in the piping
time of peace would sound incongruous, and might predict disaster if
uttered in the hideous hour of war.

I HAVE just finished Napoléon et les femmes, by FREDfb1c Masson.
Qn the cover is “dir-huitième édition,” which shows what a success
the book has obtained. The author is an apologist for NAPOLEoN.
The Emperor can do no wrong. . What in the private individual is
rank blasphemy, is, to this author, in the
Emperor only a pardonable weakness.
Whatever NAPOLEON º have been as
the "Man of Destiny” and as the greatest
. £: of his time, he was, if
most of these stories be true, as a man, a
satyr, a cad (there is no other English
word for it), and a snob. Satyr he was
apparently always; satyr and cad in cer-
tain instances, especially as regards the
“WALEwskA affair,” in which so many
personages took part; everyone of them
outraging morality, and all disregarding
the sacredness of marriage; though to
Madame WALEwska herself must be ap-
- - portioned the least share of the guilt in
which all were steeped up to the hilt...Madame WALEwskA yielded
herself as a victim to a most cruel combination of circumstances; and
of this NAPOLEoN availed himself to the utmost. It was in his power
to have behaved as a gentleman for once, but he allowed the oppor-
tunity to slip. That he appears, on one occasion, to have permitted
a poor terrified, artless victim to escape is put forward trium-
phantly by his apologist as a proof of his magnanimity; but even a
satiated animal will refuse food, though if the food is posses-
be in his
sion he will play the dog in the manger. He had a tigerish admi-
ration for the deepest tragedy, and abhorred farce and comedy. He
could play like a child with the one child of whom he hoped great
things. Cad he was always, in his dealings with men and women,
As an imperial cad he was toadied by his grovelling courtiers; but
when there is much to be gained by ying a , and every-
thing to lose by not toadying him, all will be toadies from the
highest to the lowest. The exceptions are rare. A thorough snob

In his secret heart the CAP'EN looks upon ARNOLD-ForsTER as a

ABNoLD-FoESTER, on his part, suspects the CAP'EN hasn't seen
nearly so much of the wild ocean as casual observations dropped by
him may indicate. He makes much of certain variations in the old
salt's story of how he came to lose his hand in the service of his
country. There is, certainly. some doubt as to whether it was the
Prince Consort or ALBERT Prince of Wales who sent him that
famous letter accºmpanying the hook which at this day enables the
CAP'EN to overhaul the estimates. But this is due rather to wealth
of experience than to poverty of veracity. When a man has seen
everything, gone so far, and knows so much as ToMMY, he may be

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
In the London correspondence of a provincial Fº it is stated
that "Lord HotHFIELD, who recently gave up the errors and
heresies of Liberalism to seek security in Conservatism, has been
elected a member of the Carlton. His characteristic exclamation on
entering the club the first time after his election was, “Thank God,
I can now have a quiet game of whist,' meaning I suppose, that his
mind, was now at rest.” This explanation of Lord HotHFIELD's
meaning does credit to the ingenuity of the correspondent. . It is a
sublime spectacle, that of a Radical peer forswearing his errors
merely that he may have a quiet game of whist at the Carlton.
Such a coruscating ºpecimen of the wit and wisdom of our here-
ditary peerage should go far to reconcile even Mr. LABouchERE to
the existence of the House of Lords.
CoNFUsion cn your {...}}. your turbulence, your din :
Your tattered mob of Radicals, how blind they are and lame.
Lord HotHFIELD proudly leaves your ranks, the Carlton takes him in;
Behold him in the whist-saloon enjoying of his game.
Some men are led by blighted hopes to leave the ancient fold,
And some by mere conviction, and some by thirst for fame;
And some because the Government were far too fond of gold;
Lord Hoth FIELD quits the Radicals because he wants a game.

And LABBy’s self amazed forbears the customary sneer,
When HotHFIELD in the Carlton sits enjoying of his game.
I HAVE been reading about the harvest festivals
with which the country has been *H teeming.
º are all made on one pattern. The interior
of the building is very tastefully adorned with
fruit and foliage, supplied by friends connected
with the church and others. The subject of one
reverend gentleman's discourse in the morning is,
“Put in the sickle.” In the afternoon another
reverend gentleman, discourses on “A stroll \
through a corn-field,” and in the evening a third
clergyman poses his iºnºs. with the ſº Y
question, “What, shall be done with, the Wºº
tares?” Thank-offerings, in aid of the church ºt º
funds , are then taken, the choir sings, special
harvest hymns, and somebody invariably “presides” at the organ.
THE temptations of the fruit are sometimes, I am sorry to #:
irresistible. I have seen an absent-minded landed proprietor steadily
pluck and eat his way through a whole bunch of grapes, while the
preacher held forth on the symbolic j, attached to fruit. The
attention of the congregation, I need hardly say, was breathlessly
concentrated not on the preacher, but on the devourer of the grapes.
At a festival I attended last year, the fruits of the earth were
represented by dead rabbits on the window-sills of the church.
By the way, why does one always “preside” at the organ P. At
the first blush there would not seem to be anything peculiarly
ºl about the Fº of the instrument, but then I may be
ull. For instance, ave never yet understood why young
tobacconists are always alluded to as “commencing.” Other traders
are content to begin or to start, but a tobacconist must apparently
“commence” or be eternally disgraced.

MR. HENRY BLACKBURN has been visiting Manchester and Liver-
pool, and has confided his impressions of these great cities to the
editor of the Manchester Guardian. He admires Manchester for
“its admirable tramway, street police, and other traffic arrange-
ments,” but there is an amari aliquid in the shape of the Manchester
street Arab. Mr. BLACKBURN has all an artist's tolerance; but, as
might be expected of a black and white artist, he feels bound to draw
the line, and he draws it before street Arabs. He thinks it worth
while to mention—
“A pedestrian's experience of his, generally, free fight, with the street
gamin culminating on Saturday afternoon last at 2.15 by being tripped up
and thrown down in the middle of the road near the Central Station, and only
saved from further contact with the said tramcars by rolling quickly round
and round into the gutter. This rapid act was witnessed, doubtless, by
several of your readers, two of whom rendered timely assistance. I am aware
that it is the rule in any household or community for a guest conform to
its ways for the time being, and not to complain of any contre emps; but,
having had a second encounter (of less consequence) on the very steps of the
entrance to the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, on the same afternoon, I
venture to think that the juvenile-and in some respects perfectly delightful

much of a free run in both these cities.”

THE END OF GEORGIE'S AND JACKY'S HOLIDAYS.
(A Second Extract from the Note-Book of Mr. Barlow the Younger.)
Now that the summer vacation is drawing rapidly to a close, it
may be as well to record the end of the holidays º my two interest-
ing charges, GEORGIE and JACKY. Some little time since I wrote
the º of one of their exploits. The two lads
do not live a very eventful life even in their
hours of recreation. During the mid-annual
recess I usually choose some delightful spot for
our temporary home, combining the joint charms
of change of scene and increased economy. The
fashionable watering-place of Drainville-on-Sea
§ has a suburb in which apartments may be ob-
tained at a very reasonable figure. The reason
for this lowness of price is no doubt to be traced
to the fact that many of the residences are in the
habitation of the superfluous live stock of a very
prosperous pork merchant, having his house of
business in the neighbourhood. However, in
spite of our distance from Drainville-on-Sea, my
* lads have been fairly contented with their lot.
*2. They have been able to fish, to climb trees, and
to take long walks.
“Revered Sir,” said, on one occasion, GEORGIE, who is generally
accepted as the spendthrift of my brace of students, “it would give
great pleasure to JACKY if you were kindly to give me a shilling
with which to purchase Japannese caramel cannon-balls. I have
reasons for believing that his medical attendant, Dr. CoFFYN
BlockHEAD, considers that this delicious sweetstuff, or, I should say,
pleasing physic, would be of much benefit to him.”
“Why is the lad ill?” I asked, with an anxiety tempered with
incredulity.
“No, revered Sir,” promptly replied GeoRGIE; “and I fancy that
Dr. CofFYN BLockBEAD regards the composition, which may be
obtained at a penny the ounce, or two ounces for three halfpence,
rather as a preventative than a curative. Were JACKY to have a
shilling's-worth, he would not only possess enough to ward off the
shaft of the destroyer himself, but would be able to give me a
sufficient quantity to parry the insidious dart of disease; and that
you might be satisfied that the money was expended in the life-
protecting compound in question, I would willingly undertake to
make the purchase.”
Here JACKY protested that he was quite old and conscientious
enough to be trusted with the cash himself.
“Not that I have any doubt of my respected comrade's probity,”
he uickly added; “but in matters of business one cannot be too
carerui.
“My dearºl. said I, “nothing would give me greater pleasure
than to accede to your request, had I the means at hand. fancy,
in spite of the opinion of Dr. CoFFYN BLOCKHEAD–a physician whose
name I now hear for the first time—that I should have to consider
the cost of Japanese caramel cannon-balls as an incident properly
chargeable to pocket-money. Unfortunately you both exhausted
that fund a fortnight since, by causing me to defray the expenses of
a donkey ride, which mounted up in the aggregate to no less an
amount than one shilling and eightpence halfpenny.”
“But surely, revered Sir,” suggested GEORGIE, who has a bent
for mathematics; “as our parents allow us half-a-sovereign a week
each for the purposes of recreation, the sum you mention, although
not inconsiderable, would scarcely have—”
“Stop!”. I cried, with some show of severity; “you really must
not argue with me. I do not give you all your ten shillings a week,
as I am reserving a portion of them to form the nucleus of an old-age
pension to which you will become entitled on reaching eighty. The
scheme is not without complications, so I reserve its description in
detail until you are both old enough to understand it. Enough to
say º," must repeat the present advance of a shilling is im-
possible.
After this rebuff the lads were silent, and I regret to say not
altogether contented. However, they soon, with the elasticity of
youth, regained their spirits, and were as merry and as happy as
ever. They absented themselves from my society more frequently
than before, and when I saw them, seemed to be unusually pros-
§. or to use an expressive colloquialism, “flush of money.”
Eorgie continually appeared in gigantic collars that could have
only been acquired at considerable expense, and Jacky as often
carried a new walking-stick with a fairly costly handle. On one
occasion they came home with a gift for me. It was a mug with a
rough sketch of a mule or some less noble animal on the side balanc-
ing the handle, and was labelled “A Present from Drainville-on-
Sea.” . I was gratified, but my satisfaction savoured of curiosity.
During the absence of my pupils I frequently visited the neigh-
bouring watering-place. Amongst the many distractions of the
sands was one “entertainment” which caused me considerable
embarrassment. Two “mysterious minstrels” disguised in wide-
awakes, blue spectacles, and comforters occasionally made what is
known as a “dead set” at me. These vocalists (who were small,
but noisy), did a roaring trade amongst the excursionists. They
seemed to have a long répertoire of songs. They vocally narrated
the adventures of a young person from the country, who seemingly,
with a view to enjoying the restorative effects of sea-bathing,
appeared with “her hair hanging down her back,” and the vagaries
of a body of revellers who preferred to parade
the streets “nine in a row,” instead of in
couples, or singly, when they were in a condi-
tion subsequently recognised by the presiding
magistrate with a fine of five shillings. These
ditties were not altogether unamusing, and I
might have enjoyed them had they not been
supplemented by a song dealing personally
º myself. This last effort was mere dog-
gerel, but it was so insulting that I was forced
to give the vocalists into custody. I explained
that the lines were calculated to cause a breach
of the peace, and the local policeman removed
the singers to the station-house.
This last adventure caused me some annoy-
ance, and I returned to my suburban lodgings "
in the hope that in the cheerful conversation of my charges I might
forget my chagrin. Neither GeoRGIE nor JACKEY were at home.
The hours of dinner, tea, and supper passed, and they still put in no
appearance. This caused me considerable surprise, as, although not
yery regular in their habits, they were accustomed to pay attention
to the fixtures of meal time. Late in the evening, a police constable
called, and explained to me that two boys had sent for me, as a house-
holder, to bail them out. -
The remainder of my narrative is clouded with pain. I would
willingly stop at this point... But, with a view to completeness, I
continue. On reaching the police-station, I learned to my indignation
that the “mysterious minstrels” and my charges had the same
identity. This discovery will ever be a cause of deep, regret to
myself, and, I think I may add, for very practical and sufficient
reasons, to GEORGIE and JACKY also.

RACKETY CREw 1"
A DIALOGUE OF THE NIGHT.
SCENE-The Shades at Nightfall. The
Swiftian Ladies alone.
Lady Smart, Well, ladies; now let us
have a cup of discourse to ourselves.
Lady Answerall. Tea and tattle ! That is
all the men used to think us fit for.
Lady Sparkish. Buthowtimes havechanged
—above stairs!
Lady Smart. Fie! Say rather below stairs,
Lady SPARKISH. º and down are arbitrary
or relative terms after all, in the universe.
And I’m sure there are no fine drawing-room
manners in the modern modish world.
Miss Notable. Heigho! Methinks, never-
theless, I would faintake the air of a London
n once again, however fallen off from the
dear dead days of Mr. SPECTATOR.
Lady Answerall. Hush, child ! What
would Charon say if he heard you? Though
in truth I am much of your mind myself.
Lady, Sparkish. Better, their vivid vul-
garity than our yº gentility l
Miss Notable. La, yes! "Our vaporous
“fine manners” give me the vapours.
Lady Smart. They do not have “vapours”
now, above-well tºother side the Styx, let us
say.
. Lady Answerall, Indeed, no, nothing so
simple and womanly, i' faith. They have
substituted neurotic pessimism—and chloral.
. Lady Smart. Worse far than our occa-
sional sly sippings of strong waters!
Lady Answerall. What said the dear
satiric Dean?
“Now all alone poor madam sits
In vapours and hysteric fits;
A dreadful interval of spleen
How shall we pass the time between P
Here, BETTY, let me take my drops,
And feel my pulse, I know it stops;
is head of mine, lord, how it swims
And such a pain in all my limbs l’”
Miss Notable. Whereas now it would be:–
“Now sad and sole poor madam lies,
Insomnia holding wide her eyes:
* Past ten, and not a single wink,
Though I turned in at four, I think!
If I don’t get some hours of sleep,
To-day's appointments can I keep?
And 'tis the Prince's garden-party!
Oh! to be buxom, hale, and hearty
Like some mere milkmaid, who can drowse
After a frolic and a bowse,
Upon a tumbled truss of hay!
I must have sleep. BETTY, I say,
Bring me the cognac and the chorall’
—You may supply the modern moral!”
Lady Sparkish. La, child, you are as much
a blue-stocking as the modish she-scribblers
of the century-end. We used to leave all
that sort of thing to Grub Street.
Miss Notable, †. Grub Street
has been made genteel since the ladies took
to haunting it. 'Tis now no shabby Alsatia,
but a swell sanctuary. Faith, one o' these
odd-cum-shortliesia, we used to say-fi
e'en write “The Journal of a Modern
Lady” (in imitation of the Dean) up-to-date,
for 1895, instead of 1728, to wit.
Lady Smart. Have a care, child! Already
you simper like a furmety kettle, and slop
over like an ill-made junket. Soon you'll be
as smug and self-conscious as a new member
of The Souls,” if you be not watchful.
Miss Notable. ell, but now the men are
away, what really think you, entre nous,
of the New Woman movement?
Lady Answerall. Why, that 'tis older
than MARY WoolsTonechoft, and, in fact,
originated about the time when Eve took
the first bite at the first *.
Miss Notable. Heighol 'Tis fine to sit
here in the Shades, and say so; but I own
I should like well enough to ruffle it in new-
fangled clubs and select coteries, to be the
talk of the town as APHRA BRHN was, only
in the irreproachable company of popular
savants and Bishops' sons; to see my niminy-
piminy neuroticisms go into , their tenth
edition, have my anti-matrimonial mouthings
discussed in monthly magazines and religious
newspapers, and—have a free slap at the
monster, Man, whose best voluntary treat-
ment of us means, at bottom, nothing better
than a golden cage and a silken gag. -
Lady Sparkish. “Fine words! I wonder
where you stole 'em!”—as the Dean said con-
cerning Chief JusticeWHITSHED's coach-motto.
Miss Notable. Humph! Did he not also
say, in dealing with The Furniture of a
Woman’s Mind—
“For conversation well endued
She calls it witty to be rude"?
Lady Sparkish. What do § mean, Miss?
Miss Notable. Ha! hal ! Not much.
But, as Lady ANsweraLL used to say, when
we had a dish of tea and tittle-tattle to-
gether in the sweet, solid, wicked, bewitching
old modish days, “You know fºm old Tell:
truth, and love to call a e a spade.”
Dady §. Oh, I see. As the dear
old Dean also said—
“Say, foolish females, bold and blind,
Say, by what fatal turn of mind,
Are you on vices most severe
Wherein yourselves have greatest share?”
[Here arises a general criss-cross clatter of
contradictions, and the gentlemen come
in to join the ladies.
Mr. Neverout (quoting)–
“Now voices over voices rise,
While each to be the loudest vies;
They contradict, affirm, dispute,
No single tongue one moment mute;
All mad to speak and none to hearken,
They set the very lap-dog barking.”
We were disputing, ladies, as to whether
these lines were Swift's or another's. Can
you settle the point? -
Miss Notable (sna Oh, ask a police-
shly).

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR OWN TORRIST IN NORTH DEVON.
On Torrs Walks, Ilfracombe.—“Here they come by twos and
twos, In twos on Torrs they swarm.” Quotation adapted. “Two"
form a Company Limited on Torrs Walks., The third person present
is “out of it.” They tell me these couples are all honeymooners.
*- : Perhaps; but if they are not, they ought
- - - - - to be. That’s all.
* *
Maybe these duologues are only private
rehearsals. Practice makes perfect.

terious subject.

A descriptive writer
most bracing spots in
dentally observed, I should correct the above sentence thus:–“ In
the Torrs Walks are to be found some of the most em-bracing spots
in all Ilfracombe.”
* *
£ara Avis in Torr-is-Seldom are birds seen flying about, and
still fewer hopping about, the Torrs, jocose friend, WILLY
WAgstaff says “Birds only go, “hopping' in Kent.” Good-bye to
W. W. Somehow, as a rule, the birds do not affect the Torrs. I
fancy the twopence for entry is a prohibition. Once I saw a lonely
bird on the penny path; but that was a pigeon.
x &
I have seen a whole flock of rooks cawing querulously—“quirring”
would be a better descriptive H.P. and about the lower
part of the precipitous, rocky Torrs; but never, have I seen them
perching on the highest point of the Torrs, which is as inaccessible to
these birds at twopence as would be the aforesaid lower portion to
the unwinged pedestrian even at a halfpenny; unless pedestrian
should arrive at rookery by accidentally tumbling over from above
ºn. ºnse it is much to be feared he would probably be “left till
eCl tor. * *
One of the most interesting sights on the Torrs is the occasional
appearance of a º; carrying a snow-white cockatoo,
with a magnificent yellow crest, perfectly tame, and perched on his
owner's wrist, just as the parrot used to perch on the wrist of our old
friend Robinson Crusoe.
* -
The parrot, unchained, is a genuine “Bird of Freedom”; but he
never misuses his liberty, nor abuses his privilege of speech, but,
from time to time, he erects or lowers his crest, and expresses his
approbation of things in general, or his disapprobation of anything
in particular. A great companion this PoELY.
Recent Solar Discovery.—I picked it up on Torrs Walks. The
sun was setting magnificently. Near me there stood, observing the
effect, a young lady and a very old one. Quoth the former, “It is a
grand, sun, isn't it?” And the other replied, “It is a grand-sun,
indeed.” Being evidently a grandmamma, she ought to know.
Not knowing anything about the political bias of the majority at
Ilfracombe, I should say the voter: must be chiefly Torr-ies.
- +
Of the steamers plying between Ilfracombe, Swansea, Bristol, and
other neighbouring places, it cannot honestly be said that “they
are no great shakes.” . If the Master of the Rolls possesses an
nautical authority, it might be advantageously exercised in regar
to some of these steamers.
*
- ºr
The rule for debarcation and embarcation (on the Swansea, Ilfra-
combe,. &c., steamers) appears to be, “Insure the least amount of
convenience to, the greatest number possible.” The inconvenience
. be modified (to put it gently) were the following suggestions
acteol upon :-
1st. From Ilfracombe pier there should be four sets of stairs (or
more) instead of two.
2nd. Make an upper, and a lower deck to pier; the latter for
shelter during rain and storm, Your hardy sea-dogs seem to be
perfectly unaware of the existence of water descen from the
clouds. With them the rain is “in nubibus.”
. 3rd. There should be two steamers to any one place, one departing
just a quarter of an hour before the other's arrival. § them
... Box” and,'. Cox”—as they both occupy the same harbour. Thus
the pier would never be inconveniently, or dangerously, crowded by
an outgoing and an incoming crowd at the same moment.
4th. Bigger steamers.
5th: Greatly improved catering, on board, absolutely necessary.
More hands to wait at table.
6th. Other improvements essential, but not necessary to mention
here in detail. •".
On board an excursion steamer I would retain the musicians, espe-
cially the cornet; so many persons “come out for a blow ’’ that the
absence of this member | §. orchestra would be seriously felt.
* *
On board our steamer. “The Brighton,” to Tenby and back.-I
think we must have had “the Something-ean minstrels,” whose }*.
formance was so graphically described by DICKENs in Pickwick as
enlivening Mrs. Leo HUNTER's garden party, when “three of them
Il grunted and the fourth howled”; only that, on this occasion, there
riff, who,
were about eight or ten of these minstrel boys from Ca
having left their Welsh harps behind them, sat in the centre of the
upper deck, inflicting, their delightful melodies, on such of the
passengers as were unable to get out of earshot without either goin
below, where it was “stuffy,” or into the fore part of the vessel.
When these Cambrian Choristers were not singing they indulged in
a little rough and ready play with each others caps, a humorous
proceeding that seemed to afford them almost as much pleasure as
did the sound of their own voices, for the applause with which they
greeted every specimen of their skiiſ in vocalisation was touchingly
unanimous. In this demonstration of mutual approbation I did not
notice any passengers taking part.
* *
Now suppose a party of amateur and comic musicians, a party of
amateur choristers, and a Salvationist chorus all on board at the
same time, and suppose that all these different parties had com-
menced simultaneously, each party giving its special form of enter-
tainment, would life be worth living on board that steamer? Surely
the captain, or the company, could put, up a notice that, only the
aid professional musicians would be allowed to play and sing on
rd, and so stop this Excursionist Babel.
& ºr
Advice to passengers by steamboat proposing to land at Lundy
Island—Don’t. Lundy is a most interesting island, though it doesn't
look it. Further Advice.—Stay on board and read all about Lundy
Island in your Murray's .. and, probably, you will then have
acquired far more knowledge of the place than is ever obtained by
the majority who are permitted and even encouraged to crowd the
rowing boats plying between the steamer and the shore. I, moi qui
parle, saw the men bailing the water out of these boats as they re-
turned from shore; saw the men and women jammed * together
trying to keep at least their ankles dry; and if there had only been
some playful 'Arries among the lot, just a lurch to one side,
or the other, would at least have shipped enough water to have
drenched them up to the knees, and then one frightened person
might in terror have capsized the boat. I do not know who regu-
lates these matters, I only describe what I saw with my own eyes
and what struck me as being decidedly perilous. Is it impossible to
build out a pier at Lundy Island P. If impossible, cannot some
regulation as to the number every boat is to carry be enforced?"
* *
The perfumes of Ilfracombe (I think I saw the “Perfume d’Ilfra-
combe” advertised as sold in bottles at a local hairdresser's) are
various at various times. Always on the Torrs is the perfume
perfect. But in the lower part of the town they are select and
peculiar; as *"...Tº morning, coming from bathing, and
passing by hotels and boarding-houses, appetising perfume of eggs
and bacon everywhere, with that of fried fish thrown in., The per-
fume in the road by the tennis courts, where the donkey, chairs
and cabs stand, is, as º be imagined, most delightful when all
the flys and donkeys are there at midday, afternoon, and evening.
And in the early morning, the faint reminiscence of yesterday's
donkey and cab-stand perfume is, it need hardly be said, most
exhilarating and delightful to the unbreakfasted passer-by.
* Since writing this Your Own Torrist is glad to find his remarks antici-
pated by the Western Daily Press (Bristol, September 6), which hints at
improvements about to be made in the landing of passengers both at Lyn-
mouth and at the Mumbles. Let the condition of things be bettered also at
Lundy and at Ilfracombe.
New Version.
(For the Nursery of the Future.)
THERE was a New Woman, and what do you think?
She lived upon nothing but paper and ink, ..
Though paper and ink formed her favourite diet,
This noisy New Woman could never keep quiet!
“CURRANT" Records.-The Cunard steamer Aleppo, with a cargo
of 1500 tons of currants on board, has succeeded in raisin' the
record between Patras and Liverpool, , having, accomplished the
voyage in 9 days 21% hours. This vessel has the honour of being the
first in with the new currant crop, and, as a reward, she ...be
allowed “enhanced freights.” 1500 tons of currants fully entitle
her, we should say, to “take the cake.”

up to the standard of § old Irion plus, Black-e 24 Susan days.
Quite a pretty house, and quite a distinguished set in the
auditorium.
Second Mem. (lighting a cigarette). And the play? - -
First Mem: Distinctly amusing. Both Bouagh IER and his wife
excellent, and KATE PHILLIPs, as a sorrow-stricken cook, capital.
Not quite sure whether it would not have been better to have left
M. le Directeur in France. He was there to the manner born ; but
in England—well, to put it plainly, the Home Office in Soho is not
in the least like the Home Office in Whitehall. -
Third Mem. (finishing a glass of “improved” soda water). But is
it intended to be? -
Second Mem. I don't know, but a good many of the audience
(presumably the gentlemen of the pit and gallery) will adopt the
assumption. After all, to be a member of the Civil Service is some-
thing, even in these degenerate days. The sketch of official life in
Soho will not enhance the di .# of the—shall we call it?-pro-
fession. But concede that the colouring is appropriate, and The
Chili Widow is simply first-rate.
Third Mem. Better than Bogey at the St. James's P -
Second Mem. So I have been told. And how about the Garrick?
First Mem. Alabama, with WILLARD. Not particularly exciting.
We know how good a man the popular actor can be, but for stage
purposes he is much more pleasing as a villain. And Toole is back
again in his own theatre P - - -
Second Mem. So I have been told. If, as report has it, the visit
is to say farewell, it will be a sad one. Take it all round, there is
no better actor in the world than the hero of Ici on parle Français,
and the embodiment of Pau Claudian.
First Mem, I quite agree with you. Has any one been to see
India at Earl's Court?
Third Mem. I have. About as fine a spectacle as they make
them. The Empress Theatre, worthy of its name—the †:
ment appropriate to its surroundings. Quite eclipses Olympia
in its most prosperous days. And if º want to see how a few
scraps of waste land can be conve into a region of gardens
museums, theatres, and palaces, just mount the Great Wheel, and
look down upon the scene below you. - - - -

THE AGE OF LOVE.
(To the Editor of “Punch.”)
SIR,-Is it possible, in the so-called end of this so-called nine-
teenth century, to dream of such a thing as the Age of Love? The
man of to-day, if he be wise, thinks not of the face and form of the
woman he may care to marry, but asks himself the question, “Will
she make me a good wife? Can she clean chimneys, cook and mend ;
is she capable of discussing intellectually subjects of interest-such
as dentistry, hunting, symbolism, and so forth—with her husband?
Can she grind the organ, play the comb, is she active at crossing-
sweeping and cradle-rocking, quick at smiling away one's smiles
and frowning away one's tears, ready to greet all my friends with the
same amiability she shows to me, is she prepared for intelligent
begging-letter-writing, can she scour, iš. recite, carve,
mangle, and fence P” Too often he is bound to answer, “No, she
cannot; so what good is she to me?” I do not mean to say that all
women are like this. Heaven forbid! But good housewives are few
and far between. There are many girls of the period who are
deficient in one or even more of the accomplishments above-men-
tioned, so how can she be fitted for the wife of a middle-class man?
It is all very well to love, but a vastly different matter to marry
such women as these. Good sound reason and common-sense are
better articles to possess. We cannot have too much of that—indeed,
we often get a great deal more than is good for us, so that in my
humble opinion friendship, common-sense, logic, and grammar are
worth more than all the love any man or woman can give; and it is
all very well to sneer at pessimists, but in my humble opinion they
have only themselves to blame for it, and through all ages it will
ever be the same until there is some alteration.
I am, Sir, your obedient servant, A SENSIBLE PESSIMIST.
Alma Villa, Sebastopol Road, Balham,
SIR,-There is an old saying with which we are all acquainted, and
which affirms that “there are as pretty kettles of fish in the sea as
ever came out of it.” If you will permitme, I will quote my own case.
At the age of seventy-two I married the man of my choice. We
had been married for seven days, when, alas ! the truth forced itself
relentlessly upon me that my husband was suffering from depression
of spirits. His nature, which had always been a gay and joyous one,
became apathetic; he seemed indifferent to my society, and before
many weeks were over he bored himself to ãº.
I think before eighty is only April sort of sunshine, which only
brings flowers, &c., into bud; it is June, July, and October sunshine
that makes, or the want of it that mars, the harvest. There are
many of my own and the other sex still unmarried, pure, gentle, and
loying old women, who, I think, would gladly enter matrimony.
Alas! Love is laughed about and joked about, but the souls it has
ruined are few. Trusting you will find space for my poor scribble, I
am, Sir, Your obedient servant, HAPPY BROWN BESs.

THE “alliterative” epidemic, in connection with the names of
marine resorts, is spreading to an alarming extent. A Welsh news-

taking title of “Improving Ilfracombe.” . This, however, has
nought to do with the excellent mental and physical benefits derived
by visitors to the North Devonian pleasure port, but refers to
District Council resolutions for the improvement of the place itself
—a Quixotic idea, which seems identical with that of “painting a
lily.” To the scribe of the “Seaside Series,” whose penchant is for
“apt alliteration's artful aid,” we beg to offer—without any extra
charge—a few suggestions to go on with:—Soothing Southend,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
OSTEND must be a glorious place. From an advertisement which
has appeared in an evening contemporary I gather that “the
multitude, anxious to spend an elegant and fashionable sojourn in
the country, has rendered itself this year at Ostend. It is a long
time since such an opulent clientèle has been united in a seaside
resort. At the fall of day the
vast terraces of the fashionable
restaurants, situated along the
sea-bank, present a fairy aspect.
There is quite a confusion of
dazzling costumes upon which
#. thousand gems, and all

asses through the saloons of the
ursaal Club, in which one hears
spoken all known languages as at Babel and Monte Garlo, and of which
the attractions are identical to those of the latter place.” This is the
first time I have heard of a similarity to Babel, being mentioned as
an attraction. But no doubt an opulent clientèle has peculiar tastes
of its own, especially when its dazzling costumes sparkle with
thousand gems.
In a small Belgian town (naturally not Ostend) I once saw the
following notice hung over the door of a washerwoman's establish-
ment:-
Anglish linge tooke here from 1 sou
Shert, cols, soaks, sleep-shert, pokets.
I eet my hatt.
The last sentence puzzled me for a long time. Finally I came to
the conclusion that it was not intended so much to be a statement of
actual fact as an enticement to English people, who would of course
take all their washing to a lady commanding so gay and accurate a
knowledge of an English catch-phrase.
My, third example, of English as she is spoke is from a notice
issued by an out-of-the-way hotel in Italy, which had changed its
management:-
The nobles and noblesses traveller are beg to tell that the direction of this
splendid hotel have bettered himself. And the strangers will also find high
comforting luxuries, hot cold water coffee bath, and all things of perfect
establishment and at prices fixed. Table d'hôte, best of Italy France every-
were. Onclean linens is quick wash and every journals is buy for readers.
Beds hard or soaft at the taste of traveller. Soaps every were plenty. Very
cheaper than other hotel. No mosquits no parrot no rat.
AND this º the connection is not, at first sight, very clear)
brings me to the Vicar of Sparkbrook... Only the other day he was
presiding at a meeting held in aid of the funds of the Christ Church
(Sparkbrook) Day Schools. Alluding to the importance of maintain-
ing Church Schools, he said (I quote from a Birmingham paper) that
“ though he did not want to touch on politics, he must express his
thankfulness that they had a Government in power which was
favourable to Church Schools, and which was pledged to construct,
and not to destruct.” The Vicar's feeling for emphasis is admirable,
The sentence gains immeasurably in force by the perversion
“destruct.” And we ought to be specially grateful to him for re-
fraining from the other alternative. -
If he had said, as it was open for
him to say, “which was pledged
not to destroy, but to constroy,”
§: effect would have been terri-
e.
I was staying at a London hotel
a short time ago and had occasion
to write a letter in the public read-
ing-room. Sitting down to one of
the writing-tables and opening the
portfolio I found that a previous
occupanthadleft initan unfinished
letter which, with all necessary
apologies, I here transcribeinfull:
MY DARLING HARRY,-I am fading
like a flower deprived of its natural *
nourishment without you, my darling,
my own little sniperpop—
Now what, in the name of Dr. SAMUEL JoHNson, can a “sniper-
pop” be?
How shall I name you? Darling, One word which, whether old or
ove, - - new, [you.

plan. Eureka, “little Sniperpop.”
In the Newcastle Daily Journal I read that “for some time a
certain amount of feeling has existed at Crawcrook on the question
of horse-shoeing.” This culminated, in a challenge by Joseph
DELAFIELD to GEORGE LATHAN, both these gentlemen being master
blacksmiths. A match for £5 was soon made, “each man to shoe the
foot of a draught-horse in the quickest and best style.”. Here there
must be some mistake, since if each man did the job in the quickest
and best style, the result obviously must be a dead heat. . However
“the match commenced on Saturday morning at the shop of LATHAN.
After LATHAN finished his work, which occupied forty-three minutes,
the horse was driven to the shop of DELAFIELD, who º forty-
one minutes in the operation. ... Large crowds were on the spot to

THERE is something very sporting and attractive, about all this.
One man wins the match, the other can console himself by, the
reflection that he had two minutes the better of it on time. There
seems to have been no grumbling, and (although the fact is not
stated) I have no doubt the parties met at an enthusiastic dinner in
the evening and toasted the good old English sport of horse-shoeing.
The authorities at Oxford and Cambridge might do worse than
institute a horse-shoeing competition between teams of under-
raduates, who would of course strike blue nails into blue shoes with
lue hammers. A “blazer” would be particularly appropriate to
such a contest.
OUR FASHION LETTER.
(Extracted from the “Poppleton Academy College Gazette.”)
DEAR THOMAS,-As September advances, the wave of fashion is
once more filling our best academies, so that a few hints as to the
latest modes may well be of service to you. Have you seen the new
double pocket? . It is quite chic. It is constructed simply .
making a large hole in the side-pockets of your coat, thereby you wi
find there is an useful space beneath the lining, in which such neces-
sary trifles as a lump of toffee or a Jew's-harp can be comfortably
disposed of... Buttons will not be much worn, especially as the term
advances. It is rumoured that FoEKER major has gone into tails; and
if this be true, probably others will follow his example before long.
My old friend RICHARD-a well-known connoisseur in such
matters—strongly recommends the new confectioner's shop near the
school. The Turkish Delight sold there is quite admirable, I am
told, and a single bar of the stick-jaw, if used carefully, will last for
an entire day. Talking of shopping, I have been to the bookseller's
lately. What a misfortune it is that the publishers do not issue
Messrs. BoBN's Classical Library at a lower pricel The present one
is almost prohibitive to those of us who wish to avoid a certain
amount of drudgery, and to please our excellent pedagogues at the
same time.
Have you heard rumours of a boom in marbles? Hitherto one has
associated the game with the lower classes, but I understand that
two Upper-Fifth gentlemen were seen to play it last week. If so, it
will soon be widely popular. By the way, the report that Johnson
minor is seriously ill is absurb. The truth of the matter is, that this
dashing sportsman had undertaken to eat thirty cracknels in ten
minutes, without drink of any kind. The result—he lost by half a
cracknel—was to cause him some temporary inconvenience, but he
is now completely restored to health.
Here are two recipes, which, I think, you will like:–
. 1. Bacon d la Dormitory. Procure a piece of bacon, and cut it
into strips. Impale these, one at a time, on a penholder, and frizzle
them slowly over the dormitory gas. (Care should be taken that the
tutor is out, as the fragrance caused by the bacon is considerable.)
When sufficiently done, chop up with penknives, and serve hot.
Condensed milk should be drunk with this dish.
2. Marrons d la Poppleton. Place some chestnuts between the
bars of the fireplace. Do not break the skins. Presently the roasted
nuts will fly into the room with a loud report, and much amusement
will be caused if they happen to hit anybody on the face. They may
then be picked up and eaten. Sherbet is an appropriate drink with
which to accompany them. Yours ever, WILLIAM.

Let us suppº that the Rev. Mr. SILVERTRUMPET,

the hours of seven and eleven nightly, in order to see
an amusing or thrilling play, and a popular actor

there would be crowds to come from all parts to hear

been regularly advertised in the newspapers, and
church-goers have been accustomed to look out for
announcements as to where Mr. SILVERTRUMPET, or
any other popular preacher, is to appear and discourse.

Perhaps the actor has a répertoire acquired in course

MR. Justice Punch then addressed the
prisoner in the following words:– “Prisoner
at the Bar, you have been rightly found guilty
of cymmitting the heinous crime of writing
and causing to be published a pernicious form
of composition known as a “Penny Dreadful.”
The jury who have tried you have had no
trouble in coming to the conclusion that you
are solely responsible for the fearful results
that have followed the appearance of your
latest contribution to criminal literature. Had
not Red-handed Rob left the printers there is
£very reason for believing that the manor-
house would have never been burnt down,
and that poor Mrs. SMITH would have been
still hale and hearty. Nay more, the twenty-
seven burglaries and fifty-six other crimes of
even a yet more serious character would in
all human probabilities have never been com-
mitted. For all this terrible work you are
primarily responsible. In days gone by you
would have escaped the appropriate penalty
of your wickedness. But now that the Per-
nicious Story Punishment Act has become
the law of the land, I have the power, as I
have long had the will, to treat you with be:
coming severity.” His Lordship then passed
sentence in the jº: form. Later in
the day the publishers and printers of Red-
Banded Rob were convicted of being acces-
sories both before and after the fact, and
shared the fate of their colleague in iniquity.

plenty of steamering. Lovely scenery, everywhere about, in this

Were Ilfracombe a French watering-place, how delightful it could
be made. Imagine the restaurants, the déjeuners dº la fourchette
under cover in bad weather, out in the open air in fine; the good
bands; the casino; the établissement, with excellent reading and
writing-rooms, billiard tables, library, first-rate concerts and fair
dramatic performances; petits chevaux, petits soupers al ſº. and
every possible opportunity afforded for enjoying life en plein air.
A propos of restaurants, there is a splendid chance for starting a
first-rate French hotel in Ilfracombe, with well-devised gardens, an
at such a superb height, that while it would be open to all the most
refreshing breezes—for it is impossible to feel the full benefit of
these in the valley—yet would it be warm and cosy during the
coldest months, of which, in an ordinary year with well-regulated
seasons, there cannot be many.
Ilfracombers boast that the snow does not lie in these parts. I
hope the Ilfracombers who gave me this information are, so far,
like the snow.

Of course there are golf links. The links-eye'd golf man"looks out
for these at once, and though he has got º
to go some little distance for them, there
they are—at last. Equally of course ºf
there is lawn tennis, and plenty of it &
close at hand. A shilling an hour;
“net profits.”

described on, some of the excursionist ||
handbills as “The Naples of Wales.” V
If Tenby is the Naples of Wales, then
Margate is the Monte Carlo of Kent.

Tenby Pier being in process of con-
struction, there is no landing except in
small boats, of which there appears to be
a better *}. than is * on such
excursions. But as even these boats cannot be run ashore with their
Gargoes, there are the stalwart arms of boatmen extended to carry
ladies, and boatmen's broad shoulders on which gentlemen, unable
to wade, can ride pick-a-back. Anyone over fifteen stone had better
remain on board.
* *
. A guide-book, written by Mr. and Mrs. S. C. HALL-names held
in grateful, remembrance as authorities on Irish legends—describes
climate of Tenby as being “for the greater portion of the year warm,
; and bracing.” Maybe; was not there “for the greater portion
of the year.” The “ Halls by the Sea,” further declare, when com-
paring Tenby, with Hastings, Ventnor, and Torq}ay, that it, though
equally.mild, is nevertheless invigorating.” Shouldn't have
thought it. But—very glad to hear it.
in it after the off-oyster season, we saw an ogre-like gourmand
devouring a dozen or so of the natives of Tenby, with the magic aid
of vinegar, jº.; and—and—whisky / / Of such grand consti-
tutions (should he be none the worse terwards) are heroes made!

In the character of Mr. P.'s Own Inn-spector I venture, to pro-
nounce the Walley of Rocks Hotel at Lynton, delightful. Here
everything is unpretentiously English, and even the waiters are not
all foreigners. The supply of certain articles of food may on occa-
sion run short (which ought not to happen), and consequently you
can only complain of what you don't get, very rarely of what you do.
The other hostelries may be equally , but of these Mr. P.'s Own
Inn-spectr, being un-ubiquitous, cannot speak from experience.
- -
The Valley of Rocks Hotel is so-called, because it is not in the
valley but high up, and thence you can go down by the easiest possi-
ble descent, i.e. per water-worked tram-way to Lynmouth, and so
remount. Here we go up up up, and here we go down down down O,
all day at threepence a head per journey, reduction on taking a
quantity of tickets, not persons.
- -
And here comes in my complaint. ... I do not know what numbers
this “ascenseur” will carry with safety, but that it can not carry
more than twenty, all told, inside and out, with anything like com-
fort, I, not being “Your Fat Contributor,” will honestly affirm.
Whether the proprietorship is in the hands of a company, or in those
of Sir TIT BIT NEwNEs is of no importance. If Sir T. B. N. has the
sole management, he may be trusted in future to look after this
“facilis descensus” well and wisely.
+ +
The drivers of the Ilfracombe four-horsed coaches are all good
§: not showy, but careful. Pretty sight to see CoPP's mail
the Defiance, brought at a trot between He two gate-posts, and tooled
round the small lawn up to the Walley of Rocks Hotel, Lynton.
à |N.B. Put your name down early fºr box-seat in Coppy-book.
- -
Notice that the Defiance guard is a master of horn blowing. He
tootles most of the popular tunes of the day with windy wariations,
humourously causing deep bellowing bass notes to issue from the
instrument whenever the coach is *. by a field of cattle. The
ſº takes an unfair advantage of these animals, as their peculiarity
eing to have no horns, they are unable to return the blow.'

Plenty of bathing; well managed ; might be much
gratis for “bain de lure” ºtake : boat, -
towels, spirit lamp, can of fresh water, &c.,
&c., discover natural bathing place on coast,
snugly fixed up among the rocks,—and there *-
gou are, Don't º to have with you refresh-
ments for after bath. -
- -
It grieves me to be compelled to quit Ilfra-
combe just as the real #. is beginning. I do
not allude to the North Devon Stag Hounds, but
to the arrival of September wasps, and very fine * -
autumn gnats. This morning had a glorious run º ºſ.
over tables and chairs, killing the wily wasp in SS-
the open, that is, on the window pane, with a *-º.
slipper, Luckily “pane forte et dure,” or there A. Bathing Cove.
would haye been smashery. Cut, off, his sting, if possible, with
§: of ºns it to youngest lady of party. Killed a second,
ut less wily wasp. Ran him to earth in jam pot. A third, which
entered by the door, after a rapid burst through the hall, showed
some fine sport, and on getting away in the open (window), went
to ground somewhere in the rose bushes, when the pursuers, armed
with napkins, slippers, and paper-knives, gave up the pursuit, and
returned to breakfast.
Later in the day killed a splendid gnat with very big head and
large wings. Quite a pantomime gnat. Send him, as specimen tº
Sir AUGUSTU's DRURIoIANUs. Useful as model for “property gnat”
at Christmas. Or, nail him to wall, as warning to other gnats.
+ +
Final Note. — Ilfracombe ought simply, to be perfect. , Spare
friendly criticism, and you help, to spoil the place. But I say to
the I. I. C., in all friendliness, º: them in French, “know-
ing the language,” like Jeames, “Messieurs, j’ai raison, moi; vous,
—rous arez Torrs.” And now, I am off to Cromer.
“ITERUM CRISPINys l'º-Bravo, SIMs, REEVFs! SIMMUM to the
front again, the evening front, inviting MAUD for a stroll with
him in the garden, as fresh as ever!. Glad to hear that in addition to
“Tom Bowling,” and out of compliment to the modern furore for
cricket, SIMMUM is going to produce, from his chest, a new song en-
titled “Will Batting,” which is to be dedicated to “W. G.” But

LETTERS TO A FIANCEE.
DEAR GLADYS,--I am so glad that in spite of your many engage- |
ments—one of them being an engagement to be married—you found
time to write to me again at last. You say little about your fiancé,
but that, after all, is of small importance. I approve of engage-
ments in the abstract; I know of no amusement
more harmless nor more agreeable for a young
irl; and from my own experience I shall be de-
Élisi to assist you, with any little, hints in my
power, towards making the course of true love run
as smoothly as possible.
You have not described ARTHUR very clearly—
(I am supposing, for the sake of argument, that
his name is ARTHUR ; in your agitation you did not
tell me his name, but I think you are the sort of girl
who would be in love with the sort of man who
would be called ARTHUR)—you have not, I say, told yº
me much about him; but from your letter I gather
the following suggestive facts:—
I. You were made for each other.
A simple and self-evident proposition—it needs no
comment.
II. He never loved anyone but you ! Ercept
once, many years ago; and he has told you all about it quite
frankly. She was unworthy of him ; and married Another.
Now I have no doubt whatever, GLADYs, that you are quite
jealous of this person of whom he has told you, quite frankly,
and who was unworthy of him, and married Another. I wish I
could convince you of the fact that there is no one in the world so
little dangerous to you as the person to whom he has grown in-
different. Fear rather the girls he doesn't know, the women he will
meet, the charming people to whom he has just been introduced, the
cousins he has never made love to 1 The past can not be the rival of
the present: the future may. But this is a subject on which argu-
ment is of no avail. Reason retires, snubbed: and retrospective
sensitiveness remains. Now come his faults:—
III. He does not like the way you do your hair, and he has a book
of dried flowers with their names written above them in Latin and
violet ink, and he shows them to you when he comes to tea.
These appear to be his only defects. I can understand that they
cause you some anxiety, but with care I trust in time they may wear
off. Like BUFFON the naturalist (is it BUFFon F) or somebody, I
have, from stray bones, so to speak, to reconstruct, in imagination,
the entire animal. My impression of him is somewhat vague, but on
the whole satisfactory. It is charming of him to go home and write
to you the instant he has left you—I think it only right, of course—
when people meet every day they have a great deal more to write
about than if they saw each other occasionally. One thing in your
letter puzzled me. He has been called to the Bar, but he did not go
because he had once been thinking of being a clergyman and he had
conscientious scruples about the law. What can you mean? I am
quite at a loss, but since you say it was yery noble of him and you
love him all the more, I suppose, it is all right. You say his
father has a maddening way of taking you aside and asking
you in general to “use your influence” with ARTHUR. He never
says what about, but gives forth irritating platitudes about “a
woman's tact” and “gentle feminine persuasion.”. You are quite
right to agree at once and not ask for an explanation, as it would
i. you away from ARTHUR longer, and it doesn't matter in the
east.
It is very curious about the day ARTHUR went shooting and told
you he had shot two brace of grouse, and you, found out afterwards
it was not true, he had shot thirteen. You ask me “how you should
act,” and say you have as yet “taken no steps in the matter.”
Of course, if you find him out in a little fib and let him know it,
he will think you have a horribly suspicious nature and be rather
disgusted at your want of ness; on the other hand, if you
don't show it, he will think you extraordinarily stupid and easily
duped. I think if I were you, I should whenever the subject is
alluded to, pin on an enigmatic smile and be silent. This will be
quite sufficient punishment, for the boastfulness of his modesty.
Write soon again. I am glad ARTHUR is so good to his sister's
husband. A good brother-in-law always makes an excellent fiancé.
With congratulations and ºf. good wish,
Your affectionate friend,
MARJoBIE.

Looking At Yourself IN THE GLAss l’”
“How yaiy You ARE, Effie
“VAIN, AUNT EMMA ME WALy! Why I Don't THINK Myself HALF As Good-Looking As I REALLY AM 1 '
NOT THE CHEESE I
(By an Old-fashioned Fellow.)
[“I would buy “Cheshire,' if I could get it; but I cannot. For years I
have been doing business in most parts of the country... and I have hardly
eyer seen a Cheshire cheese.”—“Fromage,” in the correspondence on “English
Cheese" in the “Daily News.”
So they’ve found it out at last, the other fellows,
The mystery that for years I have bewailed!
The cheese that with long keeping merely mellows,
The good “Old Cheshire.” from our marts has failed !
You cannot get it now for love or money,
That fair, and fine, and flavoursome old stuff,
With its amber glow as warm as virgin honey—
So different from the Yankee's soapy buff!
Don't talk to me of fine Canadian Cheddar,
Of Gloster, or of Dutch, or shams like these;
They may be cheaper greasier, yellower, redder,
But they’re none of 'em a patch on Cheshire Cheesel
Whº I used to munch it every day at luncheon; –
'Twas lovely with a glass of amber ale!
Now a chunk as hard as any Bobby's truncheon,
As dry as yellow soap, and just as pale,
They give me when Iºk 'em for Öid Cheshire,
Or a clammy stuff called Gruyere—all in holes.
Ah! “a crust of bread-and-cheese” was once a pleasure
To honest appetites and English souls.
I can do with Wiltshire, Dorset, Double Gloster,
Or even good old Stilton at a pinch,
But the modern “Cheshire” Cheese is an impostor,
From whose muckiness malodorous I flinch.
What the dickens have they been and gone and done with it?
The foreigner has mucked our market up,
And it seems to me he's .# having fun with it.
Cheese hard as any steel shot from a Krupp,
Or soft and green and oozy as a swamp is,
They give me, with some comic crackjaw name.
But thereforeign frauds—like Caesars and like Pompeys—
In mastiness seem pretty much the same.
The smell of 'em-sometimes—is something horrid.
They are limp, and locomotive, and—oh, there!
-
–
The thought of 'em makes me go chill or torrid,
Whether Gruyere, or Roquefort, or Camembert!
Then the Yankee with his tendencies Titanic
Has sacrificed prime cheese to speed and bulk.
Now they say that in our markets there is panic;
That luckless dairy farmers shake and sulk.
Well upon my Alfred David I don't wonder
If “Cheddar” cheese is rotting by the ton;
For our worship of mere bigness is a blunder
And I only hope the reign of it is done.
But why should hoyhood’s “Cheshire Cheese” delicious-
Like good old Ribstone pippins—fail and cease?
Of modern “Cheshire” I am most suspicious,
And whatever it may be, it's not “the cheese.” "
AN ASININE, PERFORMANCE.-A certain gallant and deservedly
}. colonel, whose love of politics is, perhaps, not quite so
ervent as his fondness for race-horses and greyhounds, has recently
turned his attention to another and comparatively novel form of
sport. This takes the shape of an asinus doctus-a learned, or ac:
complished, donkey-" who can be matched at jumping, eating, and
drinking, or all three, against any other member of his tribe in the
world,” and, the erudite animal gave, for the colonel's behoof, a
º exhibition of his attainments in the grounds attached to an
otel in Norton. First, Ned jumped a 5ft. 6in. bar “without an
§. effort: ” then he devoured an ounce of twist tobacco an
half-a-pound of bacon with equal ease, but the thirst provoked by
the latter comestible had to be assuaged by a *. of .*.
which he “put away” with great promptitude , and gusto.
freshed with wine he further proceeded to show a clean pair of heels
to a pony in a steeplechase, º easily—“ears down” in fact.
Finally, with a fox-terrier dog as his jockey, he galloped round an
orchard. The colonel was much pleased with the entertainment,
and well he might be. There is a brilliant career in store for that
donkey on the . stage; or even in Parliament, where he might
“ command the applause of list’ning senates,” while adorning the
Hibernian benches as, of course, Member “for Bray.”

2 Monsieur Punch.
DEAR, MISTER,-After to have as:
sisted at the Congress of Geographs at
London I come of to make a little
voyage d'agrément—a voyage of agree-
ment—to the Island of Wight. I am
gone to render visit to one of my
english friends who inhabits Sandown.
I go not to tell you his name, that
would be to outrage the privacy of
your “Home, sweet home,” I shall
call him “SMITH.” Ah, le brave
garçon—the brave boy! Eh well, this
good SMITH he invites me at him—
chez lui, how say you?—and I part
from London by a beautiful morning
of August, and I arrive to Ports-
mout. See there the Island of Wight
in face! I traverse the sea in packet-
boat, I arrive to Ride, and, in fine, to
Šandown. Tens, see there the brave
SMITH on the quay of the station l I

PSYCHOPHILOPHRENOPHYSIOGNOMY.
(Some further Wrinkles by an Amateur Delineator.)
[“A hint as to the manner you look at people, when delineating
them for }. own purpose, so that they should not be cognisant
you are taking mental notes. Never stare at anyone straight in the
face; and if whilst looking you should catch your subject's eye,
*...*. avert your gaze without moving to something about them
that they may be wearing, or to the next person; you may for the
moment appear to be looking into vacancy, or making a mental
calculation, without staring at anything in particular.”—Pro-
fessor 0., in a weekly journal.]
To be a successful delineator you should cultivate the art
of squinting. Do this readily and naturally, without any
apparent effort. This completely baffles the subject, for
even if you catch his eye, you may safely defy him to catch
yours. Beside, it economises time. In a crowd you can
often thus kill two birds with one stone, or stony stare. If.
however, nature has denied you this accomplishment, instead
of fguinting, you may wink the other eye. But this is
sometimes misconstrued, as it has a rather challengin
effect. You may find yourself (if the subject, is a lady
head over ears in a flirtation—or in a somersault down the
stairs—according to circumstances, before you know where
you are.
Acquire the habit of taking physiognomical snap-shots.
Practise this until, by merely glancing at a person in a good
light for, say the twentieth of a second, you can secure a
mental picture of his or her character, habits, and hobbies.
You can develop and intensify, if necessary, these useful
little views at home, bringing out further details as to the
subject's bank-balance, latest affaire de cour, or number of
first-cousins-once-removed. All these points can be eluci-
dated with a little patience and imagination.
Always, in conversing with a chance acquaintance you
may meet in the street, gaze steadily at the brim of his hat,
or study his necktie with a fixed and critical stare. This
will make him think there is something wrong. He will
fidget, and he come nervous, revealing the inmost secrets of
his soul. You then easily bag your instantaneous view
and depart abruptly with triumph. He will cut you dea
next time, but that doesn't matter. You have added him

meiadies rather like their new bonnets being examined. Learn,
therefore, to do this with respectful admiration, and be prepared
with an instant and favourable criticism. It is as well to master a
few technical terms, so as to avoid, for example, confusing an
aigrette with a toque.
If, on the other hand, your lady victims resent their head-gear
or hair-dye being too closely examined, you must fall back on
mental arithmetic. Calculate how many barleycorns it would take
to go round the equator, or how many white beans there are in five
black ones. If these sums are too hard to be done on the spur of the
moment, work them out at home, and learn the results by heart,
before sallying forth on your head-hunting expeditions.
Never ask a policeman without scanning narrowly his features,
nor, if sitting tºº. a 'bus-driver, omit to secure his profile. Inter-
view every crossing-sweeper you pass. Organ-grinders, also, are
fairly inexpensive material to work upon. All these common objects
are readily accessible, and frequently prove perfect mines of charac-
ter, if you only dig deep enough below the surface. But the earnest
explorer will find the countenances of cabmen to be the most remu-
nerative phreno physiognomical studies. Never mind their remarks if
you can enrich your note-book with some hitherto undiscovered trait
of human nature, with the inner meaning of some mysterious
wrinkle, or with the true poetry of a wayward wart. Return home
happy if the day's achievements include the decipherment of a mole
on a flower-girl's cheek, or the translation of some rare tint of
colour-music on the nose of some loafer near a pub.
Do not be content with the stores of face-reading lore that have
been already acquired. Each day fresh secrets should be revealed. For
instance, it has only recently been ascertained that one freckle on
the tip ºf the nose means a disposition to borrow money without
returning it; that three pimples in a row across the forehead indi-
cate unpunctuality and insubordination; or that a droop of the
left eyelid signifies habitual impecuniosity. It is still a moot point
whether a nose can be both Quixotic and witty, and how to read a
romiscuous eyebrow when combined with a constant upper lip.

an aristocratic husband, the sum of 250,000 roubles; the Count him:

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
I LEARN from The Freeman's Journal that “Lord WINDson, who
presided at the Librarians' Congress, is, an all-round. man. In
aldition to his intcret in libraries and the support which he has
given to struggling Tory papers, he is a
first-class lawn-tennis player who has
narrowly escaped playing for the amateur
finals, and a cricketer, who carries about
with him still the marks of a blow which
he received on the nose in the playin
fields of Eton College.” I assume, thou
the fact is not expressly stated, that the
(// blow was inflict
// not by the hostile fist of a fellow Etonian.
* It appears, then, that in his early youth
there was about Lord WINDsoB's nose a
something, a bridge, an angle, que scais-
je, which forbad the idea of complete
roundness. The providential arrival of a
sort of homoeopathic cricket ball removed
the protuberance, and now Lord WINDsor
- is totus teres atque rotundus. And, what
is more, he still carries the marks about with him. Gallant Presi-
dent of the Librarians' Congress!
As a small boy at Eton Lord WINDSOR, I hear,
Played a good game of cricket, but failed as a sphere.
But behold, he grows rounder, the older he grows,
With a ball to each eye plus a ball on his nose.

WEST, BRomwich, has my profound, sympathy. I read in a
Birmingham paper that “there is a complete deadlock with regard to
the mayoralty of West Bromwich for the coming year. The deputa-
tion appointed at the meeting in August have waited upon several
eligible gentlemen to try and induce them to accept office, but with-
out any success up to the present. Alderman Roll Ason has
declined, and Councillor Bushkil, will not undertake the duties, and
the committee are now doing their best to induce Councillor SLATER
to take the position a second time.” By this time, let us hope, the
difficulty may have been removed, for imagination boggles at the idea
of a town without a mayor.

In all West Bromwich's expanse they could not find a ºr

Next, moving on, they tempt again their ex-Mayor . SLATER,

The breach is ready-made,” they say; “step into it and fill it.
A vacuum a nuisance is, we ask thee to abate it;
Our edifice is roofless now, climb up and promptly slate it.”
IF Mr. SLATER should ultimately decline the proffered mayoralty,
the only suggestion I can make is that somebody should be
ricked for the office. I don't quite know what it means, but
know that every year some forty estimable gentlemen are
pricked for the shrievalty of their respective counties. One after
another they arise in the Court of Justice in which this terrible
. es place and declare that there are circumstances which
absolutely forbid them to accept the §. of High Sheriff. One
leads a reduced rental, another asks to be excused on the ground of
ailing health, but the plea is allowed in very few cases, and in the
end most of them are reluctantly pricked. e new cook on board
ship in CHARLES DICKENs's American Notes was boxed up with the
Captain standing over him, and was forced to roll out pastry which
he protested, being of a highly bilious nature, it was death to him
merely to look at. But he had to roll it out all the same. So it
ought to be with an unwilling candidate for a mayoralty.
LET us be inst to our American cousins in spite of boat-racing and
yacht-racing fiascos. There are certain things that they obviously
order much better than we do. For instance, when the silly season
resses they just mark out one of their prominent literary men and
ave him attacked by highwaymen. At least this is what lately
happened to Mr. RICHARD HARDING DAVIs, for I read in Harper's
Weekly that “a considerable number of daily journals of average
veracity in New York and Boston published accounts of Mr. DAVIS's
encounter, differing to such a degree in details that each paper
seemed to derive its information from an independent source. The
very variation of the reports was an indication of a basis to the
by a cricket ball, and |d
original tale: but after all, the despatch which carried most convic-
tion was one only four lines long, in which Mr. DAVIs was quoted
as intimating that some industrious writer had lied about him.”
NoTICE again how, magnificently they manage an earthquake.
Little more than a week ago a tel - º Tegucigalpa
in Honduras, was published in the New York Herald. In this it
was stated that “mail advices from. Yetapan announced that a
terrible earthquake had occurred in that section of the country.”
There were elaborate details. Three hundred persons perished.
Four thousand Fº from the outlying villages flocked into the city.
During the night' sheets of flame appeared at different points in
the north-west rising to immense heights. A church tower crashed
Iown, ing with it the roofs of three houses. Just before day-
light a prolonged shock rocked the entire town as though it were a
cradle, and on the mountain side quantities of zing cattle were
engulfed by lava. At Covajunca thirty-seven houses were laid in
ruins: at Cayuscat twenty-nine houses collapsed. . A later despatch
states that 353 bodies have already been recovered.” In short, this
earthquake was carried out in a style of lavish completeness, and
no expense was s to make it a record convulsion. It is unneces-
sary to add that it never hº;; There wasn't a single º in
the, whole of Honduras...Like Falstaff’s assailants, and like the
highwaymen that waylaid Mr. RICHARD HARDING DAVIs, it wore a
suit of buckram. And of all qualities of buckram the American is
unquestionably the best.
It appears, moreover, that CAIN, and ABEL lived in Central
America, and that the mausoleum of ABEL is still to be seen in Yuca-
tan, with all the inscriptions, complete. Somehow or other, a
migration to Egypt then took place, and the Sphinx was erected by
ABEL's widow as a monument to her murdered husband. All this
has been discovered by M. Le PLONGEoN.; and, to confirm the truth
of the story, Mr. W. T. STEAD is to publish it, bound in buckram,
of course. “Julia’s” share in this discovery is not stated, but there
can be no doubt that she must have been hovering round.
I AM told that Cheshire cheese is in a bad way; that the price of it
has fallen so much as to make the total disappearance of Cheshire
cheese extremely likely. At the same time it is said that Cheshire
cheese is going down $º the farmers wilfully produce an in-
ferior article. It may be so, though I hope it is not. But if it is,
why delay the punishment? To produce inferior cheese is as bad as
robbery with violence; and a dozen or so with a Cheshire cat ought
to prove an effective deterrent to the most hardened offender.

His argument was that “it would help a
local manufacture,” and that “the doctors
all approved of Munrº’s.” The chairman
suggested that, they might “be doing an
injustice to the patients by taking in
MURPHY's stout.”. Why not put the ques:
tion to the patients? It is they who
have to “take in MURPHY's stout,” not the
guardians, and they are not likely to do
themselyes the injustice” of refusing it if
drinkable. MURPHY's stout is evidently a
light brew, as it was “carried by one.” An-
other guardian described the resolution as a
“blow which GUINNESS didn't deserve”;
but GUINNEss survived the blow, and went up
ten points on the Stock Exchange next day.

PLAYING AT WORK.
A NEW MoRALITY,
[“The working woman of to-day, be she journa-
list, teacher, or what not, is suffering terribly from
fierce competition, and this is largely due to the
fact that women who are merely working for
leasure enter the labour market.”—“An Old-
ashioned Woman” in the “Daily Chronicle.”]
WHEN the Curse of Labour was laid on Man,
Toil's visage glowered grimly,
Alleviations of Fate's stern plan,
The softening spirits in rear and van -
Of Labour's march through our Life's brief
span,
If seen, were glimpsed but dimly.
Weariness followed, and dulness gloomed,
On the path of mortals to hunger doomed,
And poverty the spirit entombed
As in all too premature charnel;
The ache of limb and the fret of brain,
The slow weak pulse, and the long dull
pain,
Grew all familiar; the spirit-strain,
And the sullen revolt again and again,
Of the spiritual and carnal.
But though men knew that work and woe
Were all too closely neighbour;
One curse of Labour they did not know;
The black blight coming late and slow,
Of the fools who play at Labour !
Labour ! Faith, 'tis no passing play
But the pack-horse burden day after day
To be grimly gravely lifted.
A leaden weight, and a mill-wheel round,
By the player at labour but seldom found,
Or the amateur-though gifted.
Who has not seen a street-child run
To turn an organ-handle-for fun—
With gay, erratic vigour?
But the der who turns at it day by day
Finds Ah che la morte no pleasant play-
He works at it—“like a nigger.”
So “well-to-do women who crowd the ranks”
Of Labour are playing but childish pranks;
They are butterfly dº sprilers
Of the honeyed hives of the working bees;
They lower the wage and lessen the ease

To teach for in-money possibly’s fun
To those who're but dabblers when all is
One,
But the workers, when wages go down with

Can hardly see the sport of it.
To play at philanthropy’s mischievous, much,
For sciolists mar whatsoever they touch;
What if some Flower Girl Mission
Destroy a trade, which seeks other lands
Or throw out of work some thousands of

Philanthropy hath no vision
Save of its pretty and picturesque fad;
And the destitute drudges, angry and sad,
Whom deft flower-mounting once fed and c'ad

Works worse than playing at Charity!

For well,—"just a little pocket-money,”
To ape the bees who must make the honey
Day in, day out, for a living.
But workers who labour for “bread and
cheese,”
And not as a change from mere lady-like ease,
Regard all such amateur, sham, busy-bees
As needing, not praise, but forgiving.
What if your work-dabbling, now quite the

Cut down the genuine workwoman's wage,
Or pinch the poor ill-paid school teacher ?
“Every woman should work all she’s able”?

If well-to-do woman work helps to spread

There's fit work for all, some with spade,

By Jove, you had better be idle !

LETTERS FROM A FIANCEE.
DRAB MABJoRIE,--Thanks for your kind letter. I was hoping you
would be pleased about my engagement.
It is most curious you should have guessed, without my telling you,
and without even seeing his photograph, that his name is ARTHUR.
I must tell you more about him. e is tall and handsome, also, not
at all commonplace. He looks a little like the old prints one sees in
seaside lodging-houses, called “. With the Stream,” or “Against the
Stream,” or “Good-bye,” or “The Return of the Black Bruns-
wicker.” He looks, in fact, far more romantic than the young men
one generally sees; and the key-note (if you, will forgive the ex-
...} of his character is his great à. to modern ideas,
especially to anything he calls “ cynical.”. I met him first at Lady
Lyon,TAYMER's, but he has often explained to me that that was
entirely accidental; he was taken” there; he dislikes her set, and
has an especial aversion to the clever young men of the day. He
s an excessive—and I must say I think unnecessary—terror of
being mistaken for one: and says that if he had not heard it was the
very latest thing he would never read anything but Scott. To the
º: and cigarette, for women, he has an equally strong objection,
and I think he often pretends not to see a joke because he has a
nervous suspicion of its being what he would call the New Humour.
In the evening, on the balcony, he quotes BYRON, and in the
morning, in the garden, he reads WILKIE Collins or Mrs. HENRY
Wood. He says he *: I shall spend a great deal of time in the
still-room, to which I heartily assent, though neither of us know
exactly what a still-room is, but it sounds quiet. Women, ARTHUR
thinks, should preserve fruits, and a lady-like demeanour, and
do K. needle-work, or perhaps “tatting.” Art embroidery
he looks on with doubt, and I believe he considers it fast. When
I told him he seemed anxious I should not reap without having
learnt to sew, he seemed hurt and we hastily changed the sub-
ject. I was playing croquet with him-(croquet he "...º.º.
when he was lecturing ºn †º: “Shall you y
expect me to make jam P” I said. “Would you be cross if
I did?” he, asked, tenderly. “CRossEl yes!, and, BLACKWELL,
too, if you like,” I answered, in my (occasionally) flippant way,
which I always regret instantly after. ARTHUR threw down his
mallet. “This—GLADYs—this is the sort of thing which—which—.”
&c. We had a short quarrel, and a long reconciliation. ARTHUR is
a great dear, you must understand, and I am yery happy. He does
not show me the book of dried flowers nearly so often now, and
has written some verses about me, he is going to show them to
me to-night. - - -
ARTHUR is very interesting when he talks of me.: it is when, he
discusses abstract subjects—such as chemistry, or big sleeves-that
he is not quite so amusing. He is dreadfully prejudiced about
sleeves. Do you think he will ually get accustomed to them? I
think he will by the time they have quite gone out!
I am sure you will like dear, ARTHUR. Of course one has to
understand him. When he came down to stay with us, I said, “You
must be very tired after your short journey,” and I was surprised
how much it annoyed him , Don't say anything, of that Fort tº
him—at first. He is apt to take things—just a little-seriously. It
is rather a charming quality in a man to whom one is engaged—
don't you think so? §. a love as ours cannot fail to have an
ennobling effect: as ARTHUR says, it seems to lift us above all
thoughts of this world. Write soon. I am longing to hear about
the new skirts, and to show you my sapphire ring.

[OotoBER 5, 1895.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT CROMER.
WHAT middle-aged frequenter of the Old Ship, Brighton, does not
recall the bland personality of ARTHUR BAcon, part prºprietor and
§ representative of the landlordism of the excellent ancient
Osteirie :-
0 don't you remember A. Bacon BEN Bolt
So smiling, so shiney, and brown?
How he chortled with glee when he saw us BEN BoLT,
And charged us an extra half-crown.
The gammon of BAcon was admirable; and his strict attention to
the duties of servants towards visitors to
the hotel was “a side of BAcon” not to be
forgotten, A, B, was an ideal landlord,
ever ready at his door to welcome the
coming and speed the parting guest.
* *
“The Grand” at Cromer is not an
enormous hotel : it is a Semi-Grand.
The example of Bacon aforesaid could be
therefore easily imitated. Warned of our
arrival by letter, rooms secured, train
punctual (from St. Pancras to Cromer) to
within ten minutes, we drove up to the
door of the Semi-Grand in our one-horse
fly. Not a soul about. i.º. the hotel
is open P. Yes, the driver knew that
much, “because he had, taken some
-- people away from there in the morning.”
These might have been the last roses of summer, the last visitors at
the hotel for the season 1 We waited ; no signs of life. “Should
he (the driver) ring P” Certainly: a most happy thought. He de-
scendeth; he ringeth. We wait. Then the sound, as of somebody
coming. “A Boots in sight appears. We hail him with three cheers”
—at least, we ask “if our rooms are ready,” and the Boots is of
opinion that they are; whereupon another ts appears, and the
pair of Boots lug our luggage into, the hall, where we find an
amiable lady with keys in her hand who invites us to inspect certain
apartments. Our answer is an adaptation of Hamlet's command to
the Ghost, “Lead on, we follow.".
:- -
We see: we refuse. These are not the rooms we had ordered.
“No, they are not.” So much is admitted. Then, perhaps, we had
better depart and seek hospitality elsewhere. , Our beckoner would
rather not put us to such incrvenience, and soon discovers what
will suit us exactly. So we take them then, and there. They do
suit us exactly: not down to the ground, as they are first floor. A
room with balcony, in the shade all day, facing north, commanding a
lovely sea view. What more could mortal require?
+ -
The air of Cromer, where there is “nothing between you and the
North Pole.”—so any ma'icious reports to the contrary may be
safely disregarded—is most exhilarating. But the dust 0 | The
dust! On with the water carts, and down with sandy dust! It is
all sand-everywhere. As to situation the Semi-Grand has a decided,
and sea-sided, advantage over the ºther hotels.
Delightful view from front windows of the Semi-Grand. Of
course the back rooms are rather behind in this respect. Which is
but natural. -
- -
. Civility, and a desire to F. are the characteristics of the work-
. staff at the Semi-Grand, directly you know them individually and
collectively. But, as the song says, “You’ve got to know 'em fust.”
- -
With the arrangements of the salled manger as worked at the Semi-
Grand under the superintendence of a distinguished and invaluable
foreigner garçon, en chef, very little fault can be found. The
experiments of the youthful and less-experienced subordinates who
are probably there to learn English, are interesting from a certain
point of view, which is attained when, under the guardianship of
their chief, or one of his trusty lieutenants, * have had everything
you require. Then you can sit and watch the recruits at their
garçonc exercises. -
-
. I wonder if the Generalíssimo has them out for drill every morn-
ing before visitors are up? Are there any colleges, or barracks, for
waiters, where, as undergraduates, or recruits, they can learn their
business? From what I have seen I should say most probably not.
But there ought to be schools and colleges for waiters, with degrees
Conferred and * given. Switzerland would be the place where-
in to start this idea. -
- -
Were it not for the refreshing breezes, which rival and excel
those of Margate, the Cromerites would be burnt to cinders. As it
is, they are generally a delicate improvement on the colour of their
own lobsters when boiled. “To this complexion must you come at
last”—if you stay long enough at Cromer.
* -
A Curiosity at Cromer.—Exactly in front of where I am now
seated, enjoying the Cromeric morning breezes on the very edge of
the cliff, and at a distance of about *... yards from the
Cromer Sands, there rises a remarkable wooden º on the true
import of which I positively refuse to be enlighten by any native
offering me a mere matter-of-fact explanation.
- -
. The object, which I sketch on the spot, in order that an expe-
rienced hand shall give it artistic merit,
appears to be the gigantic wooden case
“made and provided ” for equally
gigantic cocked hat, originally worn by
Titanic Admiral, long since laid up
in sea-weed, with all the rest of his
uniform, in the locker of Mr. Davy
Jones Neptune's wardrobe keeper.
This huge object is stuck on a pole,
either as marking the last resting-
place, there or thereabouts, of colossal
Admiral aforesaid, or it has been for
ages left here as indicating the fate
certain to await the ruthless and reck-
lessly wrecked invader. It may mark
the º: where quietly, one dark night,
the Great NAPoleon rehearsed, all by
himself, the invasion of England; be-
ing only too glad to escape in the
early dawn, leaving his cocked hat
behind him, which, as a Napoleonic
relic, was inclosed in a wooden case of - -
three times its size, and here exposed, with the motto in best
Cromeric French, addressed to NAPOLEoN, should he ever have
attempted to repeat his visit:-
“Voici votre chapeau d cornes / Venez le prendre 1"
The inscription is, by flux of time and sea-water, almost, if not
quite, illegible.
*~xº~~~~
Did Napoleon ever try to land
at Cromer, and lose his celebrated
cocked hat in the attempt?
Or it may mark the spot banned and anathematised, where was
buried, according to the awfully solemn Masonic ritual, the mangled
remains of The Man who couldn't keep a secret! !
ANGLING EXTRAORDINARY.
FROM The Scotsman, Saturday, September 21, under the heading
“Angling,” appears this item ºf news from * an,” placed be-
tween fishing notes from “Loch Earn” and “Dhu ioch”:
Loch EARN.—Mr. WATson, fishing on Lochearnhead Hotel water yester-
day, killed thirty-two nice trout.
ANNAN.-There were large supplies of all classes of stock. Best beef made
7s. 6d. to 7s. 9d per stone, and mutton 7d. to 74d. per lb. There was a
crowded attendance of buyers from England and the South of Scotland, and
the demand was good all through. Store cattle had a slow trade, and were
bad to sell. Quotations:—Fat bullocks up to £15 17s.6d.; do. heifers up to
£15 7s. 6d.; d.o. cows up to £13 17s. 6d. ; calving heifers £12 12s. 6d.
Lambs, 16s, to 29; 3d. ; odd, sheep, 33; to 49s ; rams, 43%. 6d.; half-bred
*f; 41s. 6d. to 44s. ; cross do., 37s. to 41s. 9d.; Cheviots, 38s. 9d. to 41s. 9d.
HU Loch.-On September 18, Mr. KYNAston had fourteen fish, 44 lb.,
heaviest $ lb.; and on 19th, nine, 4 lb., heaviest 1 lb.
“Fat bullocks up to £15 17s.6d.” would try the strongest tackle.
Splendid specimen of “Net Profits.”
THE PUTNEY Spook-Within the last week, so reported one of the
Pººl in the *#. Telegraph, a ghost has been heard of at
Putney. undreds of Hamlets, Marcelluses, and Barnardos (with
Ophelias, and other ladies) have gone out of their way nightly to
see the ghost. What should a riverside ghost be like?" Obviously
the “main-sheet” from a sailing-boat is ready to hand, and for its
head, at * neighbouring boat-house, there is quite a choice of
“sculls.”. If any hair, there are the “row-locks.” The ghost
must not, in our opinion, be expected anywhere with or against the
stream, but in some ...“dead-water.” “Will the ghost walk
to-night?” is now the Shakspearian inquiry; to which the reply is,
“Go to Putney !”
ANGELICAL l-Herr ANGELI, the Austrian portrait-painter, whose
name, as a “noun, of multitude.” suggests “several ANGELos rolled
into one,” is now the QUEEN’s painter par excellence. Consequentl
he should be known in England as “IIer ANGELI.” May all g
ANGELI guard Her Gracious MAJESTY! Still, clever as Brother
BRUSH may be, it will take a lot of “ANGELI” to equal one
“ANGELo,” which his Christian name was “MICHAEL.”

a Juliet “with a past.” The balcony and the moonlight suit this
Juliet. Good, too, is she when, abjectly miserable, she crumples
herself up all in a heap, like the victim in a picture of Japanese
torture, so that at any moment, without surprising the spectator,
she might turn heels over head and straighten, herself out at the
feet of the irascible old Capulet. Once again let me adapt a verse
of the ancient ditty:— -
“Oh Papa, oh Papa, I’ve not made up my mind,
And to marry just yet I do not feel inclined.”
(Aside.) To Laurence the Friar I'll tell all my grief,
And the reverend gent may afford merelief
By singing (as a duet) tooral li tooral, &c.
Judging frºm the Tanqueray model, Mrs. PAT CAMPBELL ought to
have been at her best in the potion scene; but, she wasn't. As for
the final stabbing, she might as well have tickled herself with a
straw and died o' laughing.
Watching For BEs-Robertson as Romeo, I could not help think-
ing what an excellent Hamlet he would make; perhaps when I see
him in that character, I shall
remember how good he was as
Pomeo: —
“Hamlet Romeo amem, ventosus Romeo

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THE Baron has dipped into a refreshingly light and airy volume
called The Impressions of Aureole, published by Chatto AND WINDUs.
Just the volume for the tourist resting awhile from his London-
seasonable labours. Aureole does a little bit of everything and
enjoys, it all. She has the faculty of
appreciation for scenes in town and country,
at home and abroad. She “ sails away in
a galliant ship” like Roy Neil's bride into
Icebergian regions, where “we pray under
our breaths for illuminating sunshine and
the ice bink is £iºn us in half-miraculous
substitution.” “Half-miraculous” is good.
- Hºlt a miracle better than no miracle at
Then on another occasion writes
Aureole: –
“We find our way into a gleamy wood, and I
gather some crimson berries, oozing from a cool
green bank like drops of blood, while unfamiliar blossoms flourish in gay
clusters at my feet.”
..“ Personally,” says the Baron, speaking for himself, “should not
like to gather “drops of blood.’” Glad that the blossoms were so
well behaved as not to be familiar.
... How delightful to be on board with our enthusiastic Aureole, and,
if she will only trust one with it, enjoy for a few moments the loan
of her “ivory lorgnette” with “diamond initials” which “seem to
gleam responsively when,” says Aureole, “I sweep the horizon
with ecstacy.”
Aureole, the gadabout and globetrotter, is delightful everywhere.
The one touch of domestic nature does come in now and again, and
her “dear BILL,” her “handsome BILL,” her rackety, good-half BILL,
on being reminded by Aureole that they have to dine at the Savoy 7.30,
exclaims “Confound these blessed bothering, cafés. This is five
nights running. Can't we chuck the thing º' Then Aureole asks
him “What on earth do you want?” “Want!! why a mutton chop,
and a wife, and a whisky-and-soda, says BILL, brutally.” And then
they go to the “palace of luxury” and “ dine with seven other
spirits more weary than ourselves.” Sº they might
chorus the old duet of “Again we come to thee, Savoy.'"
The Masked Ball story is very well, told—quite a little comedy;
and of course all the gay resorts at home and abroad are visited
by the lively Aureole. 'Tis a sketch of “How we live now,” and
must please a number of people who are “in the movement,” and
a great many more who are out of it, but who like to be up in what
is going on, and to imagine that they also could b2 of the gay world
if only they chose. Fill me a bumper of cold (not iced) champagne,

The appreciative BARON DE Book-WoRMs.
P.S.—To those among his reading-friends who appreciate the clever
and amusing work of “Gyp,” the Baron strongly recommends Le
Caeur d'Ariane. No necessity to send to “Rue Auber” for it:
alez le chercher chez M. Roquks, 64, New Bond Street, and see that
you get it. The Baron wishes you may get it, as you are certain to
enjoy the book immensely. Be prepared to be thoroughly enjólé by
the artless Ariane. -

ROEHAMPION GATE AND THE L C. C.
THE public, represented by the First Commissioner of Works
in the Liberal Gºvernment, testified towards “Priory, Lane” (if
we remember aright, a provokingly private road, leading, as a
short cut, from Wandsworth Common up to “Roehampton Gate,”
which is a closed entrance to Richmond Park) what Sam Weller
might have correctly described as a “Priory attachment”; but
though its opening to the public would have been granted freely by
its owner, on condition that the London County Council and Wands-
worth authorities should make, repair, and keep in order the road,
the London County Council refused to take an part in the matter,
and so Priory Lane, “with bars at each end,” remains a “spot
barred” to the Richmond Park-loving Londoner. The cost of
making this mile and a quarter is over-estimated at £2000, . But as
there are, as the Daily Chronicle describes it, “bars at each end.”
surely these “bars,” if properly licensed, would bring in a splendid
revenue from thirsty pedestrians, equestrians, and wheelers of all
sorts and conditions.

Now, undoubtedly the great race in Paris at
present is the female race, the race of lady
bicyclists who, not content with borrowing
men's hearts, have appropriated the mascu-
line garment as well. The enterprising Gil
Blas newspaper recently “brought off” a
novelty in the way of Courses d bicyclettes

éclat in the Bois de Bºulogne. The fair

assembled in force, and, with “light fan-
tastic toe” and “ twinkling foot” pressing
the treadles of their willing machines, keenly
contested the various events, to the huge
delight of a concourse of frivolous boulevar-
diers. After the morning's rt the chic

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
RELIEVED for a space by my own decree
from the mere labour of searching for topics
in the newspaper press of the United Kung-
dom, I have §: seeking recreation in the
pursuit, how ºften unavailing, of the par-
fridge. “Come down on Thursday next,”
wrote my friend, HARTEy, “for four or five
days. We are § to shoot our outsides.”
This was sufficiently alarming, but it was
obviously better than shooting our insides,
and accordingly on the appointed day the
county of Norfolk received me.
Would that it were sufficient on these
occasions merely to arouse the primitive
sporting instinct of man, to revert to the fringe
cf barbarism and to sally out, scantily clothed,
with sling ºr bow or snare, in quest of game.
But alas, the curse of civilisation cannot be
got rid of; one has to think cf cartridges,
cartridge-tags, caps, boots, gaiters, stock:
ings, and heaven knows what besides. And
in the end the odds are quite ten to one that
you forget your cartridge-magazine, or that
our beautiful new pair of patent, hammer-
ess ejector guns get left under the seat of
the railway-carriage and become for a day or
two the sport of station-masters and porters
on the Great Eastern Railway.
“Shooting the outsides” is a sportby itself.
Your one desire is to keep the birds off the
land of your neighbours; the one desire of
the birds is to seek that land. Your best
covey gets up and pops comfortably into a
lovely root-field a couple of hundred yards
away, but you cannot go after it, for the field
belongs to another property, and the derisive
birds can chirp and run at their ease, while
you tramp on, shotless, under a broiling sun.
However, the outsides have to be made good,
and now and then a slice of luck rewards you.
For instance, if a neighbouring vicar has
given notice that after a certain date he means
to shoot over his own glebe, your delight is
all the keener when you all but annihilate a
. covey of birds whose home is on the
giebe.
THERE is much humour in dogs. Your
own retriever, whom you have broken your-
self, is of course the quietest and best-
behaved dog in the world. He also possesses
the surest nose and the softest mouth. Why,
then, does he choose a moment when every-
body is looking to run in wildly and disturb
every bird in the field? Or why, when you
have sent him in pursuit of a runner, does he
lie down and pant, while the keeper's dog,
a tangled door-mat of the poodle species,
solidly, and without ostentation, tracks down
the wounded bird, and finally deposits it at
the . feet, just as you are assuring
everybody that there is not a vestige of scent,
and that no dog could possibly be expected to
work in such weather.
THEN, again, I want to know this about
º: How is that, when they are
riven to the guns, they always select a novice
and unanimously fly over his head? There
is an unerring instinct about them. Your
novice may disguise himself in all the sport-
stained paraphernalia of a veteran shooter.
Bless his imple heart, he can't deceive the
birds. They come to him and court the death
that never comes with a heroic persistency.
When he has attained to the status of a
veteran, and the birds about him are scarcer,
he will look back with a fond regret to the
days of his bird-frequented novitiate.
THE long and the short of it is that par-
tridges possess a cunning amounting to genius.

Under a soft and guileless exterior the par-
tridge hides a store of deceitful wiles that
might put SHERLock Holm Es or any of his
countlets imitators to shame. His one object
is not to be killed, and this he pursues with a
ferocious pertinacity against which keepers,
beaters, dogs and guns match themselves in
vain. Here, then, is a ballad of the cunning
partridge.
THE partridge is a cunning bird
He likes not those who bring him down:
From age to age he has preferred
The shots who blaze into the brown,
Whose stocks come never shoulder-high,
Who never pause to pick and choose,
But on whose biceps you descry -
The black, the blue, the tell-tale bruise.
Or should a stubborn cartridge swell,
And jam, as it may chance, your gun,
The sly old partridge knows it well,
44 Gº §ott!" he seems to chirp “here's
n
He gathers all his feathered tribe,
They leave the stubble or the grass,
And with one wild and whirling gibe
Above your silent muzzles pass.
Your scheme you carefully contrive,
And, while each beater waves his flag,
Your fancy, as they ...}. drive,
Already sees a record bag.
But, lo, they baulk your keen desire,
Fºsh with birds the sky grows
Not one of them will face the fire,
And every blesséd bird goes back.
For partridges I'll try no more;
Why should I waste in grim despair P
Take me to far Albania's shore,
And let me bag the woodcock there.
Or on the Susquehanna's, stream
I’ll shoot with every chance of luck
The gourmet's glory and his dram,
The canvas-back, that juicy duck.
Yea, any other bird I’ll shoot,
But not again with toil and pain
I'll tramp the stubble or the root,
Nor wait behind a fence in vain.
For of all birds you hit or miss
(I've tried it out by every test),
Again I say with emphasis
he partridge is the cunningest.
So much for the partridge. Before many
weeks are over it is quite possible that Ima
have to promote the pheasant to the top ran
of cunning. And this I know full well about
my friend the pheasant, that, although he is
a large bird and seems to fly slowly, he is a
Yº ard bird to hit, as he ought to be hit.
And most of us find it much easier to hit the
immeasurable space º which every bird on
the wing is surrounded.
RAILWAY TRAVELLING.
SIR,-Whenever I find a Pullman car I
invariably travel in it. It is only a shilling
or two over the ordinary fare, but oh the
luxury! So, with the ancient Roman, who
knew all about it, I exclaim:-
“Pullman qui meruit ferat.”
The translation is evident, and I present the
motto to the Company generally.

is, therefore, the more surprising that York-

the protection of “a massive piece of mill-
stone grit which, from time immemorial, has
stood on a risin und overlooking the Aire

caused a feeling of indignation throughout the

MY DEAR GLADys, I think your ARTHUR, the ideal person to be

inclined to be literal.

is sensible; calm in his affection. Is that, a reproach P. Should you
like a “Once-on-board-the-lugger-and-the-girl-is-mine” sort of
villain as a lover ? Or a “ladies' man”—a warbler of love-songs—a
universal provider of compliments, flowers, pretty speeches, a very
WHITELY of fluty! You'd be bored to death; and dreadfully
jealous as well.
As to your tastes not being identical, that doesn't really matter.
Make a few sacrifices of those things you don't care about; bicycling,
for instance, and skirt-dancing, and then, in return for such self-
denial, he’ll probably waive his objections to afternoons, private
views, or even—in moderation—clever young men.
On some subjects, I know, sympathy seems impossible; for
instance, ARTHUR likes music, but detests concerts: while you, on
the other hand, while not caring for music are particularly fond of
concerts. A little mutual indulgence on both sides will soon put
matters straight.
After a slight dispute never hold out an instant after he shows
repentance. Also, never avoid ºrg Jealousy when you see he
expects it. This is a valuable “tip.” False #. on this subject is
a fruitful source of discord.
Do not disagree with his general principles. On the contrary,
second them ; and give him convincing reasons for his own opinions.
When it comes to a particular application of them, that you really
object to, you are sure to know how to act. Believe everything he
says, and never correct him about details, especially not if you know
you are right. , I don't think I need advise you not to bring out
authorities to show he is wrong in the etymology of a word or any
other subject of discussion, for that is absolutely suicidal, and you
would be beyond the pale of reason if you dreamt of such a thing.
Since your cousin FREDDY has been staying with you, I can
understand you find it rather awkward. I know FREDDY ; with his
love of practical jokes (for which you, too, I am certain, have a
secret penchant), and his determined chatter about his rowing, his
riding, and why he didn't back the winner, and how it is he missed
the Diamond Sculls, and so on, ad lib. I can quite fancy he doesn't
# on with ARTHUR, whom he must despise for not having put a
air-brush in his bed the very first evening.
You must have had a difficult day that Sunday that young DE
WERNEY and his sister came down. DE WERNEY, rosy-cheeked and
babyish-looking, but about whom a morbid interest centres, because
he collects jewels, and was said at one time to take morphia; and Miss
DE WERNEy, who “writes,” and is utterly amazed and contemptuous
when she finds someone who has never heard of her. If it were not
for your mother, who forgets people's characteristics, and, explains
them to each other a little wrong—which often saves the situation—
the day would have ended in utter want of harmony. DE WERNEY
left, pitying you, and his sister feeling sorry for ARTHUR. I am
glad you removed—though only just in time—an absurd booby-trap
FREDDY had placed in ARTHUR's room, because ARTHUR had said he
“romped”; and when you and your future husband were alone, he
said he hoped your companions in the future would be of a very
different calibre to your present friends. -
The depressing word “calibre,” while cheering ARTHUR left you in
lowest spirits, but of course you agreed, and then had a toboganning
match with FREDpy the next morning before breakfast, and before
ARTHUR had left his room. Write and tell me how you are going on.

of course, by marriage. Your affectionate friend, MABJoRIE.

“BIKE” FOR THE HUNTING FIELD.
ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
In a recent number of The Saturday Review I read a review of a
k of verse, which I need not ticularise further, as I am not
concerned to affirm or to dispute the justice of the critic's estimate of
it...I only refer to it incidentally. The author, according to this
reviewer, º: only the most elementary and commonplace
notion with regard to º: of epithets, or allusions. Instances
were cited, and we were further asked to believe that with this poet
(I quote from the Saturday) “the voluble thrush is a family man,
and the bibulous bee is a rover.”
THAT sentence absolutely fascinated me. It continued to ring and
ring in my brain for hours ards. It became the refrain to
ºn; read and everything I thought of. There was only one
remedy. I promptly applied it, made a copy of verses to suit the
pursuing sentence, and was cured of my ailment.
A FAMILY MAN AND A ROWER.
A Book and an oyster agreed to dispute
As to which held the record for darting:
The rook said “I’m off like a punt on a chute,”
Said the oyster “I don't think I’m starting:
That is, since I know I’m confoundedly slow,
If the rook on the mark remains steady,
I doubt if I’ll wait till the starter says 'go,”
I'll be off when he says “Are you ready?’”
Then the languishing leopard cried “Run while you can,”
And the cricket remarked “Is it over ?”
But the voluble thrush was a family man,
And the bibulous bee was a rover.
A celibate snipe thought they'd better look sharp,
But the oyster said “Who’s for the grotto?”
Thus evoking a smile from a casual carp,
Who had "carpe diem” for his motto,
And a hairy old, hoary old ourang-outang
Grunted" Harmony, gents, or you'll bore us”;
And a bandy-legged beetle, when asked if he sang,
Said he only obliged in a chorus.
Then, to make matters smooth till the racing began,
A dove, who had landed at Dover,
Cooed “Voluble thrush, you’re a family man,
But, oh bibulous bee, you're a rover.”
The runners themselves were contending for fun
On a track which was wooded with parquet:
The odds at the start were a million to one,
Which I quote as the state of the market.
“Do you think they will win?” said a truculent shark;
But the whale said, “I never think muffing.”
“What a desperate race!” was the puffin's remark–
He was palpably pained by their puffing;
Yet it cheered the whole clan, while their races they ran,
To know someone lived calmly in clover;
For the voluble thrush was a family man,
Though the bibulous bee was a rover.
Round, round came the rook, who was heartily clapped
He was winning, wings down, in a canter;
The succulent bivalve was collared and lapped,
In spite of his beard and his banter.
But a rifle went off, and a dredger drew nigh;
We shall never know which was the winner,
For the rook's next appearance was made in a pie,
wº they served u º º#. dinner.
ch proves very plainly that life is a span;
We are cattle º Death is our drover.
Fate waits for the thrush, who's a family man,
And the bibulous bee, who's a rover.
No more this week. ... I am flying from a country where September
fails to provide anything but sunshine. Perhaps in Switzerland
there may be snow and a sweet foretaste of winter. . At any rate, I
am off to find out for myself. My next “Roundabout Reading”
will be done in the country of Cantons. I shall study the Referen-
dum face to face!
“IN RE DIGGLE v. The PRogRessives.”—Mr. DIGGLE says, as long

to support the Progressives, and pay for it, is Re-diggle-ous! Quite so.

SKETCHES FROM SCOTLAND.
ON A CALLANDER CHAR-A-BANCs.
SCENE-Infront of the Trossachs Hotel. The few passengers bound |
jor Callander have been sitting for several minutes on the coach
‘‘ Fitz-James” in pelting rain, resignedly wondering when the
driver will consider them sufficiently wet to start.
The Head Boots (to the driver). There’s another to come yet;
he'll no be lang now. (The cause of the delay comes down the hotel
steps, and surreys, the vehicle and its occupants with a surly scowl.)
Up with ye, Sir, plenty of room on the second seats.
The Surly Passenger. And have all the umbrellas behind dripping
on my hat! No, thank you, I’m going in front. (He mounts, and
takes up the apron.) Here, driver, just look at this apron—it’s
sopping wet!
The Driver (tranquilly). Aye, I’m thinking it wull ha' got a bet
domp.
#. Surly P. Well, I'm not going to have this over me. Haven’t
you got a dry one some-
where?
The Driver. There’ll be
dry ones at Collander.
The Surly P. (with a
snort). At C der! Much
good that is l (With crush-
ing sarcasm.) , If I'm to
keep dry on this concern, it
strikes me I'd better get
inside the boot at oncel
The Driver (with the air
of a man who is making a
concession). Ou aye, ye can
get inside the boot if ye’ve
a mind to it.
[The coach starts, and is
presently stopped at a
corner to take up a male
and female passenger,
who occupy the seats
immediately behind the
Surly Passenger.
The Female P. (enthu-
siastically, to her com-
anion). There's dear old
rs. MACFARLANE, come out
to see the last of us ! Look
at her standing out there in
the garden, all in the rain.
That’s what I always say
about the Scotch—they are
warm-hearted
[She waves her hand in
farewell to some distant
object.
Her Companion. That
ain't her ; that 's an old
apple-tree in the garden
{. 're waving to. . She's
eeping in-doors—and shows
her sense too.
The Female P. (disgusted). . -
Well, I do think after our being at the farm a fortnight and all, she
might— But that’s Scotch all orer, that is; get all they can
out of you, and then, for anything they care—! -
The 'Suriy P. I don't know whether you are aware of it, Ma'am,
but that umbrella of yours is sending a constant trickle down the
back of my neck, which is most unpleasant l . .
The Female P. I'm sorry to hear it, Sir, but it's no worse for you
than it is for me. I’ve got somebody else's umbrella dripping down
my back, and I don't complain. -
The Surly P. I do, Ma'am, for, being in front, I haven't even the
pºlition of feeling that my umbrella is a nuisance to
any DOdy.
A Sardonic P. (in the rear, politely). On the contrary, Sir, I find
it a most pleasing object to contemplate. Far * I
don't doubt, than * scenery it .." happen to conceal.
A Chatty, P. (to the driver...not because he cares, but simply for
#: * of conversation). What fish do you catch in that river
ere
The Driver (with an effort). There’ll be troots, an , maybe, a
pairreh or two. - -
The Chatty P. Perch? Ah, that's rather like a goldfish in
*y: eh P
river (cautiously). Aye, it would be that.
Chatty P. Only considerably bigger, of course.
“Ou aye, ye can get inside the boot if ye’ve a mind to it.”
Driver (evasively). Pairroh is nº averra beg fesh.
Chatty P. But bigger than goldfish.
Driver (more confidently). Ou aye, they’ll be begger than goldfesh.
Chatty P. (persistently). You 've seen goldfish—know what
they're like, eh?
Driver (placidly). I canna say I do. - -
They pass a shooting party with beaters.
Chatty P. (as before). What are they going to shoot?
dº.” They'll jist be going up to the hells for a bet grouse
ivin'.
A Lady P. I wonder why they carry those poles with the red and
and yellow flags. I suppose they’re to warn tourists to keep out of
range when they begin firing at the butts. I know they hare butts
up on the moor, because I've seen them. Just look at those birds
...; after that man throwing grain for them. Would those be
grouse --
Driver. Ye'll no find grouse so tame`as that, Mem; they'll jist
be phaysants. Qasa -
The Lady P. Poor dear things! whyººl 're as tame as chickens;
# º seem so cruel to
them
Her Comp. Well, but
they kill chickens, occasion-
y.
The Lady P. Not with a
horrid gun; and, besides,
that’s such a totally diffe-
rent thing.
The Chatty P. What do
you call that mountain,
driver, eh?
Driver. Yon hell? I'm
no minding its name.
The Surly P. You don't
seem very ready in pointing
out the objects of interests
on the route, I must say.
Driver (modestly). There
'll be them on the corch that
know as much aboot it as
myself. (After a pause—to
vindicate his character as a
cicerone.) Did ye nottice a
bit building at the end of the
loch overyonder?
The Surly P. No, I didn't.
Driver. Ye might ha' seen
it had ye looked.
[He relapses into a con-
tented silence.
Chatty P. Anything re-
markable about the build-
ing P
I}river. It was no the
building that’s remairkable.
(After a severe struggle with
his own reticence.) It was
jist the spoat. 'Twas there
Roderick Dhu fought Fitz-
James after convoying him
that far on his way.
- [The Surly Passenger
snorts as though he didn't consider this information.
The Lady. P. (who doesn't seem to be up in her “Lady of the
Lake”). Fitz-James who?
Her Comp. I fancy he's the man who owns this line of coaches.
There's his name on the side of this one.
The Lady P. And I saw Roderick Dhu’s on another coach. I
thought it sounded familiar, somehow. He must be the riral pro-
prietor, I suppºse... I wonder if they've made it up yet.
The Driver (to the Surly Passenger, with another outburst of com-
municativeness). Yon stoan is called “SAwMson's Putting Stoan.”
He hurrled it up to the tope of the hell, whaur it's bided ever sence.
[The Surly Passenger receives this information with an incre-
dulous grunt.
The Lady P. What a magnificent old ruin that is across the
valley, some ancient castle, evidently; they can't build like that
nowadays l.

“GRAMMERCY l’’ quoth the Baron D'AGINCOURT, as he rolled off
his bicycle into a potato-bed; “tis a full-mettled steed! Methinks
those varlets have fed him with overmuch oil of late, so restive is he

ment, shameless girl l’’
“Nay,” replied the beau-
teous Lady AGATHA, as
with exquisite skill she
rode her dainty steed (a
thorough-bred Coventry)
up and down the terrace,

“I have seen none,” said
the lovely maiden, with blushing cheeks; “at least, save only

“Whom, girl?” insisted her father.
“Sir ALGERNoN FITzcLARENCE.” -
With a desperate swerve, the Baron rode towards her, his face
purple with passion. - - -

Lady AGATHA,” he commanded, as twenty men rushed forw in
answer to his summons, “into the upper dungeon. And, varlets,
bring me the sticking-plaster.”
CHAPTER XXII.
'Twas midnight. Alone in the dismal cell to which her father's
cruelty had consigned her, the Lady AgathA wept unceasingly.
Sleep came not to her weary eyes, she paced restlessly up and down,
i. azed through the narrow bars of the window over the moonlit
andscape.
Suddenly she startedl Was it fancy? Nay, 'twas a human
voice, manly, resonant, and strong, that sang beneath her window.
She could catch some of the words:
“O sweetest blossom of the lea,
0 daintiest flower of the field!
For love, for hopeless love of thee
My reason must her kingdom yield”. . .
It was ALGERNoN FITzcLARENCE"
“Across the land, across the main
A single steed shall bear us twin”
He was ascending by a ladder! His face appeared at the window!
“Ah, darling AGATHA,” he said, “news was brought me of th
parlous state 1 But, dry thy tears, my sweet! - See”—he snap

castle gate. Let us fly together l’”
- + -
º *
Noiselessly the gallant steeds flitted along the road.
... Were’t not to light our lamps?” whispered AGATHA.
“Methinks that the sage councillors of the parish—”
“Nay, I fear them not,” said the intrepid FITzcLARENCE. “Enough
for me is the light of thine eyes.”
Suddenly their steeds slackened pace simultaneously, and a faint
hissing sound was heard. They looked at one another, and groaned.
“We are punctured!” cried Agatha, It was too true. At the
foot of a steep hill they dismounted, their tyres flabby, shapeless,
useless. FITCLARENCE passed his hand over the ground.
“As I thought!” he said bitterly, “’tis thy father that hath
contrived this He hath scattered tin-tacks broadcast over the road
to foil our attempt to escapel , But we will baffle him yet.”
For some minutes he worked his air-pump in silence. Suddenly
a sound was heard at which AGATHA grew deathly pale. It was the
clear resonant note of a bicycle bell l
... We are pursued!” she cried. “Let us fly, ALGERNoN.”
“We cannot,” said her practical lover; “the tyres are almost
empty. We can but meet our doom bravely!”
Aouder, and louder came the noise of ºiling wheels. Then—a
whirr, and the Baron, breathless, pale with terror, went by them like
a flash of lightning ! FITzcLARENCE understood in a moment what
had happened. , The Baron was but an unskilful rider, and had
allowed his machine to run away with him down the hill!
To stop him was impossible. . He went along the highway for
thirty-two and a half miles, and then, with a last despairing yell
he vanished over the cliff, still seated on his steed, and was burie
beneath the waves of the English Channel. So FITzcLARENCE and
AGATHA returned to the castle, and lived happily ever after.
*
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
IN the Nineteenth Century the Baron skimmed an article on “The
Gold-mining Madness in the City,” by S. F. WAN Oss. There’s a
deal of method in this madness. Isn't it rather presumptuous in a
“Van Oss” to advise Bulls and Bears not to make asses of themselyes?
Amusing article in Macmillan for this month on “Moll Cut-
purse.” Even OLIVER, the Protector, couldn't protect himself from
this nimble-handed, light-fingered lady, who entertained very prac-
tical notions on the Common-wealth.
Capital chatty book, published by ARRowsMITH (but evidently
º; to have been published by “CHATTY AND WINDus”), is
Platform, Press, Politics and Play, by our worthy gossip, T. H. S.
Escott. “Just the sort of book % a quiet half hour in these chill
October evenings,” quoth the BUsy BARON DE Book-WoRMs.

“ONE OF THE “UPPER TEN.'”—“Rev. HERBERT BRookE,” we

In such a position the reverend gentleman will be a very high
churchman. Likewise ought he to be a very learned one, seeing
that he is to be chaplain to Les Savants.
THE Member for SARK writes from the remote Highlands of
Scotland, where he has been driving past an interminable series of
lochs, to inquire where the keys are kept 2. He had better apply to
the local authorities in the Isle of Man. They have a whole House of
Keys. Possibly those the hon. Member is concerned about may be
found among them.
TAKEN FoR GRANTED.—Although members of the London County
Council, whose business it is to attend to the “nice conduct” of
theatres and music-halls, may be said to have “given up all their
wild proceedings” of a year ago, their actions of late have, never-
theless, been characterised by “unbridled license.”

AH, cherubic little curate, in your surplice spick and span,
Who has struck that happy medium twixt an angel and a man,
Would it bore you much to tell mehow you managed to attain
To that turret of perfection which in time I hope to gain P
For I see you in the pulpit, and I dote upon your word,
And I listen to such eloquence as rarely I have heard; -
But at times there comes a whisper, like the flutter on the wind,
Were you always, little curate, such a pattern of your kind P
When a schoolboy, young and noisy, did you never tell a fib,
Or use a KELLY's literal" key” (ah, call it not a crib!) P
Did you never, at a season when your age was hardly ripe,
Encircle with your rosy lips a surreptitious pipe P
And when you went to Cambridge was your 'Varsity career
As spotless as your surplice, and as uniformly clear
From a vestige of a blemish P Qh, you properest of men,
Were you never, never proctored—were you always in at ten ?

SMORLTORKIANA.
[“Count Smorltork—the famous foreigner—

. . . . ‘Have you been long in England P' asked
Mr. Pickwick. “Long-ver long time—fortnight
—more.’ ‘Do you stay here long º' “One
week.” “You º have enough to do,” said Mr.
Pickwick, “to gather all the materials you want in
that time.’ ‘Eh, they are gathered,” said the
Count.”—Pickwick.]
THE Smorltork race have multiplied
Since Dickens wrote about them.
They prate and rate on every side;
Fools read, and wise men doubt them.
To every land from every land,
Post-haste, the prattlers travel.
They take a week to understand,
A fortnight to unravel, -
A month, at most, to write a book
That sums up all creation ;
They fathom England in a look.
And France in a sensation.
But most of all they seem to love
To cross the wide Atlantic,
Then Jove and all the gods above
Must roar at Smorltork antic,
SMoRLTORK-a Briton or a Frank,
A scribe or a fanatic–
The Yankee race will gauge, grade, rank,
In summary emphatic.
He, like a cockney sparrow, cocks
His eye at all around him,
As Pharisee his sense it shocks,
As Philistine, confounds him.
In seven hours he sums a State,
In seven days the lot of them;
And his next business is—to “slate”
And talk prodigious rot of them.
At a huge, motley continent
He gives a glance quite cursory,
And vows it seethes with discontent,
And is corruption's nursery.
He finds New York a Tammany den,
Chicago just a Hades;
The Yankees not quite gentlemen,
The Yankee º scarce ladies.
Slave to the sex, the male, he vows,
Is but the female's poodle;
And when not worshipping his spouse,
He bows the knee to “Boodle.”
The labouring East, the lawless West,
He scans in a “split second,”
And in “two jiffs” of scampering quest
The Stars and Stripes are “reckoned.”
They’re “gathered” in his shallow brain,
Like pea-nuts in a pannikin.
Bah! SMoRLtoRK is a vapid, vain,
Wituperative mannikin.
“Potry, poltic, science, art,
All tings”—from pigs to pictures—
He bans in criticisms “ smart,”
And sciolistic strictures.
Of courtesy the open shame,
Of feelings coarse affronter,

The Cork Constitution, however, goes to the
root of things by saying that “want of enter-

rish fish being caught by the anglers of
Dieppe. The State has already constructed

(By “Hansom Jack.”)
[“Gentlemen, the way to see London is from the top of a 'bus—from the
top of a 'bus, gentlemen!”—Mr. Gladstone to American Visitors.]
No. VII.—'BUSSES, BILKS, AND BOOSYS.
Top of a 'bus!, Well, I've nothing to say against knifeboards or
garden-seats, quite the contrairy.
Looked at as look-outs on London itself, as a city, they’re easy, com-
manding, and airy. --- -
G. O. M. hit it in once to those Yankees. But still, if you’d view
London life, as a wholer,
Not mere bricks and mortar and lamp-posts, I'll back what cute
BENJAMIN D. called the London Gondôler.
I’ve drove the Grand Old One, though 'e's such a walker 'e don't
give the wheels so much work as did Dizzy.
But I’d like to stick'im some hours on my perch with my 'ed at 'is
elber. Ah, then we'd be busy.
The 'bus 'as the pull of us one way, you see; our fares can't git
mounting the roof; they’re insiders l
But Cabby looks inside and out, and that way gits the bulge on the
rest of the drivers and riders.
Moresomeover the 'busses and trams keep the main, whilst we
'Ansoms can take all the short-cuts and bye-ways;
And when you know sububs and slums, you're aware London life
don't all run in the big stream of 'ig *:::
Its creeks and its backwaters, ditches and jº, they teem, fairly
teem, though their dwellers—poor cusses l-
Can only just ketch the tram-bells in the distance, and ain't never
bossed from the knifeboards of 'busses.
That’s just where swell ink-slingers miss the true London. That
wasn’t the way though with good CHARLEY DICKENs.
Pickwick is one of the books in our Shelter, and Pickwick, I'old,
gives the reader rare pickins.
When drying my legs over corfee and heggs I git a larf out o' that
patter o' Sammy.
It ain’t quite our up-to-date kibosh, o' course, but the way as that
Sam chewed the rag was just jammy.
Knowed some queer things about London, 'e did, 'is London, of
course, cabrioleys and such-like.
My survey’s “extensive,” and likeways
and Sammy seem much of a much like.
A whip, like old Weller, I do not, like 'im, do the same bit o’ road,
come-day-go-day together.
I know, in my line, every inch of the town, at all times o' day, and
in all sorts o' weather.
I'd just like a turn “Round the Town” with young Sam,' or a talk
over sossige and mashed in our Shelter;
Comparing of notes, with the Growler for chorus, I'aven't no doubt
we should come out a pelter.
“Cabby,” they sing, “knows 'is fare.” I should think so, or else
'e must be a blind mug or a babby,
And who, from a dook to a chorister minx, 'asn't, one time or other,
been “fare” to a Cabby ?
I've driven the dook and the damsel together, as fur as that goes.
And the dook was that squiffy
'E wanted to go me.“dooks up” for the fare. But that would 'ave
brought down the slops in a jiffy.
You mustn't 'ave much flesh and blood, as a Cabby, I tell you. At
scrapping we’re most of us 'andy;
But knockin' out nobs, as a rule, doesn't pay, when said nobs 'ave
been mixing champagne and neat brandy.
The boosys and bilks try our tempers, I tell you. But tempers are
luxuries, like sparrer grass is.
If you've seen a helderly, hamorous gent, on the tiddley, you know
what a worriting assis. -
Argue for hours about sixpence, 'e will, then 'unt all 'is pockets, and
find 'e aint got one.
Collapse in a corner, and fall fast asleep, with a boiled baby smile
on 'is chump. 'E's a 'ot one.
Hit 'im P, Qh no!, E may waste you a hour, and then offer a drink,
which 'e'asn't the price of ;
And maunder and mumble till you are arf mad; but if an old stager
you’ll take the advice of,
You won't knock 'is'ead off! It's tempting, I know, and sometimes
you would give twice the fare for the pleasure;
But squiffy old gents are the magistrates' pets, they’ve got money—
at 'ome—and, what’s more, lots of leisure!
“THEACLE” now, can't 'old 'is tongue with old Tiddleys. Poor
“TREACLE” was once a smart gentleman farmer,
And kep'is own dog-cart. 'E's got one fair daughter, who, even in
chocolate cotton’s a charmer.

Ah! sweet as fresh 'ay, in a manner o' speaking, is young BESSIE
FINCH, though she’s but a machiner.
Its curious 'ow sulky old “TREACLE” lights up when 'is gal BEssIE
brings 'im 'is poor bit o' dinner.
'E was just taking up an old Tiddley one time when Miss BEssie
turned up, and the bosky old geeser
Made eyes at the maid, and said just arfa word, when poor TREACLE's
fist caught 'im a slap on 'is sneezer
As made 'im see stars. 'Twas a trifle too previous, p'r'aps, for a
sulky old chip of a Cabby;
A 'ero don't look like a 'ero somehow when 'is phiz is wind-blue and
'is billycock shabby.
Old Tiddley was quite a respectable gent, a benevolent buffer, who
lived out at Clapham;
And when subub saints'ave been dining a mossel, it won't do for
grumpy old Growlers to slap 'em. -
So “TREACLE,” as usual, got toko, you see, likeways missed a good

Which shows as a Cabby 'is temper must check, and in trifles must

“Poor LITTLE DICKEY BIRDs
DEAR LIITLE Dickey Birds ' "
THE THIRTY-ONE-AND-SIXPENNY
DREADFUL.
(By Mr. Punch's Own High-Class Polic:
News Reporter.)
At the Grosvenor Square Criminal Court
the case of Lady D'Edbroke came on for
hearing at the head of the list. Interest in
this alleged crime in high life drew together
a vast galaxy of Society women, and His
Worship was with difficulty accommodated
with a seat on the bench. Opera-glasses ruled
from one-and-sixpence-in-the-slot. The
first charge brought against her ladyship was
that of refusing alimony to her husband. A
second dealt with the desertion of her children.
The prosecution undertook to prove that Sir
BENEDIck had been found at night on the
doorstep of the d’Edbroke Mansion without a
latchkey or other visible means of subsist-
ence. Lady D'EDBROKE (née Swag) was de-
scribed as the daughter of a wealthy
Birmingham manufacturer of antiques. By
her marriage into the ancient and honourable
house of the D'EDBRokes she had relieved the
fortunes of the three-and-twentieth baronet,
whose assets at the moment had been nil.
Two children had been born of the marriage,
and these had recently been discovered in a
state of emaciation in a Park Lane crèche.
Counsel would call her ladyship's maid to
give evidence of the kind of literature to
which her mistress had been addicted. That
domestic would admit that she (the domestic),
being bored by the feeble and fatuous
character of the Penny Dreadful as a guide
to immorality, had been in the habit of
utilizing her mistress's left-off thirty-one-
and-sixpenny and other expensive shockers.
He hoped to show that this class of work,
though not above the level of the Penny
Dreadful in point of literary qualities, was of
a mere seductive piquancy. At the time of
the prisoner's arrest her drawing-room and
boudoir were littered with printed matter,
from the titles of which he would select four
specimens: A Melodrama of Spasms, The
uperfluous Male, A Neo-Platonic Passion,
An Edenless Adam. From the last of these
he ventured to read an extract or two, in the
selection of which he had been assisted by
the pencil marks and marginal comments of
the prisoner. The book, he might add, was
from a lending library.
“A veritable Dian, flame-red with the
shame of maternity, the young mother of
twins faced her cowed and miserable husband.
Mentally she threw up the sponge ready for
the next round, for she had still a shot in her
locker with which to run a mucker.” .
Council here explained that the writer, a
simple woman, was still feeling her way in
the use of sporting language.
“‘JAMEs,” she said, ‘I was an ignorant girl
when I married you for your wealth, you me
for my beauty of soul. There I thought that
the bargain had ended. How was I to know
that women have a tendency to bear children?
No one ever pointed out to me any precedent
for this. In my innocence it had never
occurred to me that I might myself have been
originally born.’”
Here, a Juror intervened to request that
he might, as a family man, be allowed to
retire. Leave being refused, he then asked
if ladies ought, to listen to such extracts.
His Worship thereupon ordered all decent
women to leave the court. No one moved,
and the extract was resumed.
“‘And now, in the full pride of my sexless-
ness, I have had a painfulfall. ... I am branded
with the mark of servitude. The laughing-
stock of my emancipated sisters, I shall go
down to posterity as a mother.”
“Lord JAMEs winced. The mother of twins
continued.
“‘Had mine been the wealth and yours the
beauty of soul—and of this you can never
have even been º course would
be plain. I should, by the right of the
Married Women's Impropriety Act, banish
you from this house. ever should you
darken these doors again, though you might
linger on the doorstep, an Edenless ADAM, a
worm, a periwinkle at the gate of Paradise!
As it is, being compelled from lack of filthy
lucre, to tolerate existence under your roof,
I insist that these signs of my degradation’
—here she pointed defiantly at the twins,
who howled—"be kept for ever from my eyes
under the tutelage of hired menials, in a
º with padded walls to be built out
over the billiard-room. Otherwise I propose
to leave you and become a Tableau Vivant!’”
At this point the usher rebuked applause in
the galleries.
A second extract ran as follows:– “A year
later, in the height of the season at Battersea
Park, a remarkable tandem was the object of
universal comment. It consisted of Lord and
Lady JAMEs, or, more strictly, Lady and Lord
JAMEs, for Lady JAMEs steered from the
front, clad in high collar, starched shirt,
breeches and gaiters, while Lord JAMEs fol-
lowed in a blouse and divided skirt, doing
all the work. A symbol this of the conditions
under which he was now admitted to the pri-
vilege of communion with her. That the
man should be compelled to do the work, itself
a mark of serfdom, was but one of many con-
ditions laid down by the predominant partner.
Another was that he should not offend decency
by appearing in the recognised costume of a
woman. Hence the blouse and divided skirt,
lately relegated to male use.”
Here His Worship observed that this extract
failed to bear upon the issue, and it was then
shown that the pencil; mark with the comment
“Good again!” was the work of another sub-
scriber to MUDIE's. A third extract, taken
from a new book of the Six-Shilling-Shocker
series—A Melodrama of Spasms—began:
“I am glad that these sins of your magenta
breeding are no irony of fate.” The foreman
of the jury demanded an elucidation, which
Counsel was unable to produce. Court still
working at enigma when report left.
A HYDE-ous DANGER. —“Hyde Park”
should be our Show Park. At present it is
the Hiding Park for all the scum of the town.
Mr. P. summons First Commissioner of
Works, Commissioner of Police, and “George
RANGER,” who, he believes, has not yet re-
tired from this office, to step out at once and
do their duty.

THE JOLLY YOUNG WATERMAN.
(Up to Date.)
AND did you not hear of the East London Watermen,
Who our requirements failed to supply, .
If the weather was hot or was cold in severity
Their pipes and their cisterns were equally dry.
In cold or in heat they charged as steadily,
But water to drink we couldn't get readily;
Yet water or none, with an impudent air, -
They charged all the same, and it didn't seem fair.
What sights of distress there were seen in the district,
Its drains were unflushed, and were tainted withal, -
(There was always a cause—some “Progressive” obstruction,)
But the party supporting them grew very small;
And often would there be both swearing and sneering,
But 'twas all one to them the complaining and jeering;
For cursing and praying they little did care-
But charged us for water—it didn't seem fair.
But, only to fancy how strangely things º,
While rates were collected for nothing at all,
The Government Board held a special it quiry,
Which sat for a while in the Hackney Town Hall.
And should this report (to the Company's sorrow)
Be issued to-day, next month, or to-morrow,
The East London Company'd better take care–
As charging for nothing is scarcely quite fair.

SKETCHES FROM SCOTLAND.
AT THE DRUMQUHIDDER HIGHLAND GATHERING.
SCENE–A meadow near Drumquhidder, South Perthshire, where
the annual Highland Games are being held. The programme
being a long one, there are generally three events being contested
in various parts % the ground at the same time. On the
benches immediately below the Grand Stand are seated tº
Drumquhidder worthies, Mr. PARRITCH and Mr. HAVERs, with
Mrs. McTAVISH and her niece, two acquaintances from Glasgow,
to whom they are endearouring—not altogether successfully—to
make themselves agreeable.

MR. BRIEFLESS IS INTERVIEWED.
“A GENTLEMAN to see you, Sir,” said my admirable and excellent
clerk PoETINGTON, a few days since, as I was looking through the
circulars that had accumulated on my table in Chambers during the
earlier portion of the long vacation.
** A client?” I queried.
“No, Sir, I think not,” was the reply, supplemented with a card
placed on my desk. “At least, I do not
remember the name in your fee-book.”
“You do not believe he has called on
any errand of an unpleasant character P”
“Oh no, Sir l—the rates have been in
for a fortnight. If I might hazard a sug-
gestion, I should say he was a literary
gentleman.”
I smiled, but was a little uncertain as to
the better course of action. No doubt the
man of letters was seeking an interview
with a view to its subsequent reproduction.
I am not altogether in favour of these
public betrayals of private affairs, but con-
sidered that there could be no harm in this
instance if I consented to see the iour-
nalistic intruder. To tell the truth, of
late—much tomy annoyance-reports have
been in circulation rather prejudicial to my
pecuniary credit, I am not, a rich man.
In these hard times who is ? But for all that I am able to keep the
wolf from the door, and maintain a position not derogatory to the
status of barrister-at-law. It occurred to me, as I requested PoET-
INGTON to admit the visitor, that perhaps the meeting might lead to
satisfactory results. If the caller happened to be an interviewer, I
might “inspire” him;
“Mr. A. BRIEFLEss, Jun., I think,” said the new comer, as he seated
himself in a chair and referred to a pocket-book. I bowed. “This
is not your private address—these are your chambers ?”
“Certainly,” I returned; “but perhaps, before we go further, you
will be so good as to tell me what you want?”
“Well, briefly, a statement of your affairs for the last, three
years. I will not º for anything of an earlier date.”
I again inclined #. head. I was not altogether pleased with my
visitor's manner. He was certainly abrupt, and he adopted a tone of
authority thatjarred upon my nerves. Possibly he wished to give the
account of our interview to our cousins across the Atlantic. If this
were so, I need not be over-scrupulous in my statements. Ameri-
cans are accustomed to the rouge of exaggeration on the cheek of
fact. So I would convey a false impression if I omitted, so to
speak, the magnifying cosmetic. ... - - - -
*You do nºt propose to make public anything in this country?”
“Assuredly not,” he replied. “All you say will be treated con-
fidentially, save with the necessary exceptions.”
I was satisfied. Of course the exceptions would be the people in the
Republic of the West. I told him that my practice was a large one.
“Indeed?” As it struck me that the exclamation savoured of
surprise, Ithought it advisable to repeat the statement with emphasis.
“Yes,” I continued, “there are many of my brethren at the Bar,
better known to the world than I am, who would be pleased to change
places with me. Because my name does not ap Ver *: y
in the newspapers you must not imagine that I am idle. On, the
contrary my chamber practice is immense—distinctly immense.”
º freely, he murmured, and then mentioned the names of
two or three of my learned friends whose incomes were, decidedly
considerable, and asked me if I deemed my practice equal to theirs.
“You put me in rather a delicate position,” I returned with a
smile. “Of course, I do not know the exact amount of the takings
of the gentlemen to whom you have referred, but personally, I should
consider my own practice more lucrative than theirs.”
“Well, I do know their receipts,” said my interviewer, “so I can
estimate yours. Thank you very much. And now is there any
other source of income omitted? Have you houses or shops, or any-
thing of that sort?”
...As a barrister, I am prevented from trading,” I replied, again
with hauteur. And then I continued: “I am afrai W. take
too deep an interest in the commercial side of my career. What you
should wish to learn, as my introducer to the American public, is my
opinion ºn matters of the day. Now, for instance, I believe—”
“Pardon me,” interrupted my visitor, rather 'brusquely. “But
you have told me all I desire to know.”
I bowed, and then I asked in what publication I might expect to
see the interview.
“See the interview l’exclaimed the caller. “What interview f"
“Why," I explained, rather angrily, “the interview between you
and me. You are a journalist, are you not ?”
... A journalist] Certainly not!, What made you think that?”
“Then, Sir,” I cried, indignantly, “what right had you to force
yourself into my presence, and waste my time in asking a number of
useless, and, I may add, impertinent questions?”
. “I had the right, and the questions were neither useless nor
impºrtinent.”
Explain yourself, Sir.”
“With pleasure;” and then he added, with a smile that did not
provoke its fellow on my own countenance, “you must know that I
am an assessor of income tax l’”
Comment would be superfluous ! (Signed) A. BRIEFLEss, JUN.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
MESSRs. BLAckwood have got as far as Felix Holt in the re-publi-
cation in popular form of the works of GEORGE ELIOT. It would be
interesting to know how the venture has fared with the popular
fancy for which it was designed...It **
is said young men and maidens of the
present date cannot read the CHARLES
DICKENs whose books enthralled their
fathers and mothers. How does
GEORGE ELIOT, who in her day held
8. §. with the novel-reading
public second only to CHARLES DICK-
ENs, withstand the changes of fancy
and fashion? My Baronite has been
trying the experiment on himself by A.
reading again, after, the lapse of &
many years, The Mill on the Floss. Sº
He reports that he finds the first
volume flag a little, by reason of the ºx ---
minute record of childhood's troubles
and schoolday tasks. But in the second volume, where the tragedy
of love is worked out with surpassing power and infinite skill, the
old spell is woven again. The Mill on the Floss, is certainly one
of the best of GEORGE ELIOT's novels, being completed before, the
malign influence of schoolmaster GEORGE HENRY LEWEs made itself
felt. To this extent, it is not a fair test of the problem suggested.
But the collection as a whole is rich in value, In, “the Standard
edition.” Messrs. BLAckwood present it in daintiest form, and at a
marvellously cheap price. - - -
The Shoulder of Shasta is not a new joint from an entirely new
animal, as those who are tired of “the Shoulder of Mutton” may be
sorry to hear; but, it is a charming romance, in one volume, written
by BRAM STokER at his best. The heroine's name is “Esse”; and the
%. interest of the story lies in the question, “Esse or non Esse”
—“to be or not to be” the wife of “Mr. Dick.” . For there is a “Mr.
Dick”—not in any way related to DICKENs's “Mr. Dick,”-who
is a kind of Buffalo Bill among the Indians. There is a Miss Gimp,
a governess, whose peculiarities certainly do recall those of Mrs.
Nickleby. W. Bºštorº's plot is a boîte à ..º. and yet a
most simple and natural story. Go to Your butcher's and order The
Shoulder of Shasta, to be served up “d la STOKER,” N.B.-For
“butcher’s” read “bookseller’s”; ’tis published by “A Constable”
who “knows what subjects to take up,” says the thoughtful

“Hansom up!” may be the cry when the day is fine and dry,
But wait till it comes night, and a fair drencher.
Then they lead me a rare dance, and don't give me arf a chance,
Of a doss, a peck, a pipe, or modest quencher.
Then through dark, and frost, and wet, there's another cry, you bet,
From the mouth of shiverin” swell, or shoutin' Peeler.
º dames drag cloak and skirt round damp hankles from the dirt,
As they shrink from the chill wind, and the shower's sputtery squirt,

I AM at Davos. Be careful about the pro-
nunciation: Fº the accent broadly on the
second syllable, and you have it. ith me,
if I may say so, it is a case of Davos non

health, but to act as travelling-companion to
one of the best fellows in the world, who
seeks health and strength in this quiet and
beautiful valley. God be with him, and
with all his fellow-sufferers here. Here are
some notes taken on the way.
Hall of the Grosvenor Hotel, 10.30 A.M.–
A mixed crowd of anxious French, and
English people: a sprinkling of Americans.
Desperate inquiries from an elderly French
lady for her box. A moment ago the box
was visible, a monumental box º
reposing near the door. Nowit has vanished.
Is the box to be added to the questions pend-
ing between France and England P No.; it
is found—on a truck. The French Ambas-
sador may rest in peace. On a sofa reclines
a magnificent, Arab, tall, stately, bronzed,
aquiline, robed in a waving burnous and a
turban of dazzling white. How he casts our
puny, ditto-suited, cloth-cap civilisation
into the shade. An almost irresistible im-

rection against the French oppressor, to be
laid after death in a splendid tomb with a
cupola amidst the lamentations of thousands
of lithe and dusky warriors,
11 A.M.–We are off; handshakings, wav-
ings of handkerchiefs. Still dreaming of
Algeria, I am recalled to actuality by a stop-
page at Herne Hill.
Calais.-The home of the demi-poulet, not
forgetting the ſtageolet. , Perpetual entrances
of imperturbable officials with chorus “Les
voyageurs pour . . . .” Consequent series of
shocks inimical to quiet eating. At last our
turn comes. Each of us has bagged a demi-
poulet in record time. Why all this hurry
At any rate we are off.
Laon, 7 P.M.–Dinner, English traveller
wants whisky. “Arez vous doo risky 2 "
Lady of restaurant shakes her head. “Pisky

inspiration, but the landlady, protesting she
can supply eau de vie, denies all knowledge

helpful old lady, an English fellow-traveller
looking at the tariff-board on which the word
“rhum ” figures, “perhaps they call it

siasm: “Avez vous doo room f° Enter
guard: “Les voyageurs pour Bále.” Only
just time to pay. Off we go again.
Bâle, 5.30 A.M.–Train stops: consultation
of watches. Can't be Bâle: not due till 6,30.
Another hour for sleep; turn over, when
door opens suddenly and an alarmed Swiss
porter ejaculates, “Mais deshendez done,
Monsieur, le drain {: bartir,” Out we go:
the sky becomes dark with hats, sticks,
wraps, handbags. Have we got everything?
Yes—no—where is my waistcoat? Quite

watch, money, everything. Approach of

sees in this “a victory of the individualist

Zurich, Berne, and Bâle, or brought home
by Swiss writers and politicians who have
studied in Germany itself.” Sédan is avenged.
It appears, too, that the Swiss voter is getting
bored with Referendums. He has had too
many of them, and on this occasion barely
half of him recorded his vote. Merry Swiss
voter, awaking on a Sunday morning, in-
quires of his merry Swiss wife, “Any voting
to-day, my dear?” “Only those silly
matches,” replies M. S. W. “Oh, drat they

to that effect). “I’m not going to trouble

On the way to Landquart.-Sudden alarm
of my companion. He clutches my arm, and
points to the roof of railway carriage, saying,
in an awe-struck voice, “What does that
mean; why do they put that word there?”
Following with my eyes the direction of his
finger, I notice white dial, with moveable
hand, let into roof. Plainly painted in bold
letters on one side of the dial is the word
“hell.” On the other side, however, I see
the German word “dunkel,” which, of
course, makes things clear. Quite natural,
though, that apparatus for turning light up

for a Salvation Army warning,

railway to Davos begins. We have still more than 3000 feet to climb
before reaching our destination. Obtain beautifully-coloured little
pamphlet with map. Learn that we are about to travel on “highest
adhesion railway in Europe.” Prepare ourselves to be as adhesive as
possible by taking in immense amount of ballast in the shape of lunch.
On consulting map, presumably drawn to scale, find that Dayos is at
least five times the size of London, which minutely in upper
left-hand corner. This is delightful. Delight, however, dashed
by observing that the distance from Landquart to Davos is nearl
three times as great as from London to Bâle. Still, after the shoc
of finding ourselves under Central European time, we are prepared
for, mºst things. At last the little toy, engine puffs violently,
metaphorically takes off its coat, , and, like, Mr. Snodgrass,
announces in a very loud tone that it is going to begin. We startſ
Hurrah, we adhere!!
UP, up, and still up we climb, hanging on here and there by our
eyebrows to mountain precipices, and *. down into chasms on
the other side. Still we adhere and the gallant little engine puffs
away like mad. Amiable Swiss guard takes a paternal pride in it
in the train, in the scenery, and (after usual transference of silver
in us. Have we ever been at Davos before ? No? In that case, it
appears, we must prepare for pleasures before which the overrated
amusements of Paris and Vienna pale and dwindle. Davos at last.
Davos.-Wonderfully hearty reception at the Hôtel d'Angleterre.
Mr. DEMMER smiles, Mrs. DEMMER smiles, the boots, the waitress,
the housemaid all smile. We smile, too, and find everything pre-
pared in rooms of the most brilliant cleanness: dinner, and so to É.
Conversation in Davos is of great simplicity. We are all either in-
yalids or the friends of invalids. At first hearing it would appear as
if a gigantic ball, at which nobody danced, was perpetually taking
place. “Have you been sitting out much to-day ?” “Yes, I sat
out nine hours.” “Ab, I only managed to get in seven,” &c., &c.
For the pure and perfect air is the main element of the cure at Davos,
and in nearly all weathers the invalids are on the verandahs drawing
in these †. of new life and vigour.
On the following morning I stroll. Remember that, curiousl
enough, I haven't seen a single soldier since I arrived in §§§.
Here, however, is a photographic group of non-commissioned officers
of the Davos section of some infantry regiment. All their imple-
ments of warfare are drawn, a martial defiance gleams from every
eye. In the centre of the group two of the most warlike cross their
protecting swords in front of a tall *# allegorically attired in
cloak, and scale-armour to represent Helvetia. I immediately
abandon contemplated invasion and annexation of Switzerland.
A band is playing under an arcade of glass in front of the
Åurhaus. They play really admirably-as good a band, as I have
heard for a long time. But they are all, to a flute, dressed in black
frock-coats, tightly buttoned, and black top-hats, for all the world
like a provincial British municipality out for a holiday. Every-
thing, save for the band, is wonderfully peaceful. A few cows browse
in the valley, their pleasant bells drowsily tinkling. The surround-
ing mountains have donned their white crowns in our honour: the
snowy, silent peaks glitter in the brilliant sun. In front of our
hotel a retriever puppy, with an imperfect control over his paws,
engages in a romp with a little white dog. He bowls, over the
little white dog, and, before he has quite recovered from the shock,
bowls him over again. This is too much for the white dog's dignity:
he bites the retriever violently in a tender part of the back. "Woe,
woe, the game is over, and the puppy flies homeward. In the after:
noon the colony sits out again; it sits out finally after dinner. And
so the quiet days proceed, for the time of toboggans and skates is not
yet. . It is a peaceful, a delightful spot, and on every hand are to be
met hale and hearty folk who drifted hither, derelict wrecks, to be
towed into haven and made sound for many a voyage. The tales of
gº. cures vary the conversational record of hours of sitting out.
St. Luke, the good physician, is the patron saint of the little English
Church here, and might well be the patron saint of Davos itself.
A Council of WAR.—The pugnacity which tradition tells us was
the chief characteristic of the Kilkenny Cat Conferences, finds a
parallel in a recent meeting of Aberdare District Councillors, at
which, among other compliments, such as members bluntly accusing
each other of falsehood, the chairman, advised a counsellor to go to
the – gentleman whose name is usually omitted in polite converse.
The seconder of a motion Fº by a Justice of the Peace. had the
following remarkable and withering invective hurled at him from
the chair: “You know nothing about it, Mr. GEORGE, knows but
little, and you know less,” while, another counsellor observed, “I
should show at least that I had a little brains.” This gentleman is
to be congratulated upon his consciousness, of superior, cerebral
strength, and if the council possesses but “little brains” this de-
ficiency is amply supplied by a corresponding wealth of choler and a
copious flow of wrathful language.
“BONNIE DUNDEE.”
THERE was something exceedingly pretty in the doings at Dundee
the other day when the burghers assembled to do honour to their
old Member Mr. ARMITSTEAD. In the Parliament of 1880-5. Mr.
ARMITSTEAp's commanding presence was a familiar and welcome
feature. Since then, having piloted Mr. GLADSTONE in successive
- - journeys about the conti-
º nent, his personality, has
obtained a wider field of
recognition. When, at
Biarritz and elsewhere, the
population, tracking Mr.
GLADSTONE, came upon this
tall, straight figure, with
- -º-º-º: flowing beard, and kin y
-- - - tº honest eyes, they thought
- "… -- §s nº he must be the Grand Old
nº - | > -->º Man of whom they had heard
so much. They, it is said,
cheered him accordingly,
leaving Mr. GLADSTONE free
Bonnie Dun-deel
from embarrassing attention. That isº a fable. . Certainly,
in Dundee, where Mr. ARMITSTEAD lived and worked for forty years,
there is no chance of his jºi. for any other G. §. M.
Having retired from public life, Dundee wanted to have a portrait of
its most honoured citizen. That was very nice, but as acceptance of
the suggestion would have involved his presence at the installation
of the portrait, and the making of a speech, in response to all the
kind things said, Mr. ARMITSTEAD º, shrank from the ordeal.
But he managed, after all, to gratify Dundee. He sat for his
portrait at his own expense, gave it to the city, and, represented to
the life on canyas, felt at liberty to absent himself from the public
meeting at which the Lord Provost º: the picture on behalf of
Dundee. Thus beyond the timorous Tweed do Merit and Modesty
dwell together.
QUITE CORRECT.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-In your number of Oct. 5, “AN INCONSTANT
TRAVELLER” quotes Mrs. Malaprop as saying “Caparisons are
cdorous.” Perhaps it may interest him to know that the quotation
correctly reads thus:–
“Mrs. Malaprop. No caparisons, Miss, if you please. Caparisons don't
become a young woman.—The Rivals, Act IV., Sc. §:
“Comparisons are odorous,” occurs in Much Ado about Nothing,

auspicious occasion that which, perhaps, is of most interest to the
“fastest trundler” takes the shape of a magnificent piano, the gift
of a “syndicate” of admiring friends. His favourite tune on a
winter evening will, of course, be “Tom Bowling”; and what more
appropriate, after some stirring anecdote relating to the “hat-trick,”
than a spirited “Bolero”? Then, too, music descriptive of a “leg-
bye.” may surely be found among PAD-EREwski's compositions. By
the way, the Christian name of THOMAs, as shared by LoATES, RICH-

WINTER COVENT GARDEN OPERATIC NOTES.
SIR AUGUSTUs ANGLo-OPERATICUs has done well at Covent Garden,
and will probably #9 ºne better. To Miss ALICE ESTY, as Elsa, in
Lohengrin, we say “Esty perpetua.” All are good: and the houses
have been apparently as good as the company.
A season of German-French-Italian Opera in
English is a risky venture for a winter season;
still, if successful, and at popular prices, there
is in it good promise for the future. The con-
ductors are Messrs. FELD, HENSCHEL, GLovER,
and Mr. C. HEDMondT, which sounds like an
English rendering of Téte Monté. A Tête
Monté can *: many a project through
triumphantly where a Tête moins Monté
would fail.
Tuesday, H.Excellent Faust, Mr. PHILIP
BROZEL, first time in English, decidedly good.
Sir DRURIOLANUs, thought the old opera
“wanted a fillip,” and so gave us PBILIP
BROzEL. KATE LEE a capital nurse, and FANNY
MooDY a delightful Marguerite. OLITzkA a
<'s pleasing Siebel, and conductor GLovER, as his
- name implies, keeping all hands well º:
and ready to give fits to any and that might be “difficult.” The
remainder of the week “going strong.”
In the interests of English opera, or rather of opera in English,
we wish DRURIOLANUs Covent GARDENsis OPERATICUs, with
Messieurs Tête Monté et Cie., every possible success.
THE AMNESIA BACILLUS.
It was an alarming state of affairs. The first indications of the
new epidemic were noticed in the autumn of 1895. A lady who
mislaid her identity at Brighton, and failed to recover it for a whole
week, had the doubtful distinction of being the initial case. Her
example was very shortly after followed by a servant-girl who “lost
er memory” at Three Bridges Railway Station. . Not being
properly labelled, there was naturally some delay before she was
fººd to her supperless and sorrowing mistress. Then the plague
spread.
Ampng the first to suffer were the numerous class of persons who
had been so unfortunate as to borrow money. The simple operation
of transferring a half-crown or a fiver seemed to carry contagion
with it. From the instant that the fatal coin was in the palm of the
innocent and * borrower, all recollection of his previous
personality vanished. The unhappy victim had no resource but to
start life afresh as he best could, with new struggles to face, new
lenders thus to victimise him—and new capital (a paltry equiva-
lent!) wherewith to mourn his hopeless loss of memory. It was
observed that these sufferers were subject to recurrent attacks of the
amnesia bacillus. Some scientific alienists went so far as to main-
tain that the complaint was no new one, but had been prevalent, in
a more or less virulent form, ever since the first leather coinage was
invented.
The Woman with a Past was the next to succumb. She was not
quite so much en évidence as in the two or three previous years;
still, a considerable number of her carried on a contented, if obscure
and occasionally chequered, existence. She only rarely imitated the
Second Mrs. Tanqueray in putting a violent end to her career.
Then all at once she, too, caught the disease. All the romance fled
out of her life, all the deep º: into masculine character, all the
love-souvenirs, so interesting to herself—and to her female acquaint-
ances. (They did not forget any of these entertaining details, how-
ever.) But as far as she was concerned, her Past completely
yanished, and, poor thing, like the half-crown borrower, she had to
begin all over again. It was weary work, converting her future into
a Past, or series of Pasts, and if she frequently failed in her task, we
must put it down to the deadly and character-destroying bacillus.
Then the New Women took it severely, and quite forgot them-
selves. However, they have been so completely, advertised and
satirised of late, that there is no necessity to describe the symptoms
of this class of patient any further. e might add, though, that
in some cases the sequelae of the complaint aged the subject by ten or
twenty years.
It was distressing to note that even the respected occupants of the
Bench did not invariably escape; but they received the infection in
a mild form. They fairly well managed to retain their dignity and
personality, but they could not remember the names of such common
objects as an “oof-bird,” or the meaning of so familiar a term as
“going tommv-dodd.” This was inconvenient, as it necessitated the
employment of cockney interpreters.
. It was a cate of “dunno.'oo they are” with a good many other
individuals and sections of the community.
One reverend gentleman had it badly, and turned litigant on the
spot. Quite oblivious of his sacerdºtal functions and character, he
imagined that he would be a public benefactor if he went about
suing unoffending 'busses for obstructing a minute portion of their
window-lights with advertisements and notice-boards. This amused
the public at first, but after a while he was voted a nuisance and a
bore. Then the Salvationists caught the bacillus en bloc. One and
all they thought they were musicians, and, as such, entitled to make
Sunday a Day of Riot.
Amongst other unfortunate specimens of humanity were the sho
lifters, who fancied º were shop-walkers; the burglars, who
habitually mistook their home address; the quarterly tenants, who,
on the other hand, forgot to remain at home at periodical intervals;
and our old friend’ARRY, who forgot his manners and his h’s.
The list of victims might be indefinitely extended. Once it was
§ that they were responsible for their actions; but now,
thanks to the progress of medical science, the amnesia bacilius has
been identified. . It only remains for a new PASTEUR to invent some
counteracting microbe.
CRAZY TALES.
THE Duchess of Pomposer was writhing, poor thing, on the horns
of a dilemma. ... Painful position, very. She was the greatest of
great ladies, full of fire and fashion, and with a purple blush (she
was born that colour) flung bangly arms round the neck of her
lord and master. The unfortunate man was a shocking sufferer,
having a bad unearned increment, and enduring
constant pain on account of his back being broader
than his views.
“Pomposer,” she cried, resolutely. “Duky
darling !”
(When first married she had ventured to apos- (,
trophise him as “ducky,” but His Grace thought &
it infra dig., and they compromised by omitting
the vulgar" c.”) - Ž
“Duky,” she said, raising pale distinguished
eyes to a Chippendale mirror, “I have made up
my mind.” -
“Don’t,” expostulated the trembling peer.
“You are so rash l’”
: What is more, I have made up yours.”
“To make up the mind of an English duke,”
he remarked, with dignity..." requires no ordinary
intellect; yet I believe with your feminine hy-
draulics you are capable of º JANE.” -
(That this aristocratic rib of His rib should have been named plain
JANE was a chronic sorrow.) - -
“Don’t keep me in suspense,” he continued; “in fact, to descend
to a colloquialism, I insist on Your Grace letting the cat out of the
bag with the least possible delay.”
“As you will,” she replied: “Your blood be on your own coronet,
Prepare for a shock—a revelation. I have fallen! Not once—but
many times.”
“Wretched woman l—I beg pardon l—wretched Grande Dame !
call upon DEBRETT to cover you!”
“I am madly in love with—”
“By my taffeta and ermine, I swear—” -
“Peace, peace!” said JANE... “Compose yourself, ducky—that is
PLANTAGENET. Forgive the slip. I am agitated. My mind runs
on slips.”
The Duke groaned.
“ Horrid, awful slips!” -
With a countenance of alabaster he tore at his sandy top-knot.
“I have deceived you. I admit it. Stooped to folly.” -
A supercilious cry rent the air as the Duke staggered on his
patrician limbs. - -
With womanly impulse-flinging caste to the winds—JANE caught
the majestic form to her palpitating alpaca, and, watering his beloved
features with Duchessy drops, cried in passionate accents, “My
King ! My Sensitive Plantſ Heavens! It's his unlucky back
Be calm, PLANTAGENET. I have—been—learning–to–bike! There !
On the slyl " -
The Duke flapped a reviving toe, and squeezed the august fingers.
“I am madly enamoured of—my machine.”
The peer smoothed a ruffled top-knot with ineffable grace.
“Likewise am determined you shall take lessons. Now it is no use,
duky. I mean to be tender but firm with you.” - -
The Potentate gave a stertorous chortle, and, stretching out his

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SCRAPS FROM CHAPS,
MoUNT THE BUTTER-TUB 1–
Irish butter is on its trial, it
seems. It has managed to get
a bad name, because some of
the makers or dealers become
so attached to it they won't
part with it for a month or so
after it is churned—and when
they do part with it they pre-
tend it’s new. So the trustees
of the Cork butter market
suggest a “ date-brand” as a
means of restoring the damaged
reputation of the Hibernian
cow. It is quite obvious that
if butter is to keep, it mustn't
be kept—which sounds like a
bull, but it’s true. Now is
the time for Irish patriots to
come to the rescue of their
firkins—to form a “Brand
League” if necessary—and
#.' the produce of Irish
airies being evicted from the
markets of England.
WHY SHOULD GLAsgow

taken by a telegram to get
from Glasgow to London, or

minutes, and the cry of the

merce, in consequence, is
“More wires 1 * The Chamber
does not mind if they are over-
head wires; all it objects to is,
overdue wires. There has been
a railway race to the north;
but a telegraph race seems
still more wanted just now.
And the worst of it is that the
lordly Stock - Exchange folk
are specially provided with a
wire that sends their telegrams

curred at the Cork workhouse;

guardians are, thinking of
getting in outdoor relief for
the chins of their paupers.
Why not an “Irish Melody,”
to this effect?—
The barbers have struck, farewell
to the shave,
And the rate-supplied soap on the

ship in opposition, 1s possible
though improbable, is al-
most, completed ; but appa-
rently it is still “ a deed with-
out a name.” What is it to
be called? The board, not of
directors, but of advertisement
outside, says, “This Magnifi-
cent Hotel,” &c.,. &c. ell,
gentlemen proprietors, why
not take this description as
the title? It does not look bad
in French, “ L’Hôtel Mag-
nifique.” And in plain Eng-
lish “The Magnificent” is a
striking title, which can be-
come popular as “The Mag.”
Mr. Punch, as General Hotel
Inspector and Universal Board
Adviser, offers the above sug-
gestion.
“FINIS."
(By an Old-fashion?d Novel-reader.)
OH ! when we finished a tale of old,
The thing was through, and the story to'd.
But when we shut up a tale that’s “New.”
There’s little told, and there's nothing
“through.”
With neither beginning, middle, nor end,
We do not part with the book as a friend.
Finis!. The word seems ironical sport,
It is not finished, but snapt off short,
Like *: #" maid's nose by the blackbird's
ea
In the “Song of Sirpence.” That tale was
weak,
Ending in nought, like an alley blind.
But our story-spinners appear to find
Their moral there. Their tales don't close,
But break off short-like the poor maid's
nose!
Ah me! for a few of the fine old chaps
Who gave us meals, not mere dishes of scraps 1
“Post Obit.”—The Sheffield Daily Tele-
graph announces that the first piece of patron-
age in the district which has fallen to the
new Postmaster-General is now being com-
peted for. It is that of medical officer to
the local post-office. Our contemporary an-
nounces that the applications, which are said
to be very numerous, have all gone in. It is
generally understood that the gentleman
ultimately selected to undertake the duties
of the post will not necessarily be connected
with the Dead Letter Department.
A CLERICAL MISTAKE.
(Fragment of a Romance found shortly after the
holding of the recent Clerical Meetings.)
“You are most kind,” said the guest, get-
ting down from the dogcart and assisting the
retainer to carry his portmanteau into the
house.
“Not at all,” was the reply. “If you are
so good as to wait a moment, I will take the
vehicle round to the stables and then show
you your room.”
The i. bowed his head gratefully, and
yet with some embarrassment. Who was this
retainer P He seemed to be a man of educa-
tion, and yet— Re had no time for further
thought, as the subject of his meditations
returned to him.
“I was as speedy as possible,” said he: “as
I knew you would like to dress. The rector
dines rather early, and is sure to be punctual
to-night. This way.”
And then the two young men marched up
the staircase, and entered together the spare
room.
“There !” exclaimed the retainer, as he
finished laying out the contents of the guest's
portmanteau. “Now, all you have to do is
to look sharp and get down into the drawing:
room, before the arrival of the bishop. I shall
try and snatch a few moments' doze, as I
have been busy from the early morning.”
“I really cannot sufficiently, thank you,”
said the guest, hunting in his waistcoat
pocket for a shilling. “But if you will
allow me—' -
“Oh, no thank you,” interrupted the re-
tainer, with a slight blush. “I really do not
require a tip.” - - --
"But surely, from your multitudinous
duties, you must be the butler?”
Then came the solution to the mystery.
“Oh dear no l I am not the butler! I am
only the curatel”
A NEW SWAN SONG.
[Miss ANNIE Swan says—“What appears to be
required is, that the wife should have something
of her own, given to her freely by her husband for
her own use and benefit, absolutely apart from
other moneys, that she should spend it as she
chooses.”]
OH ! give me something of my own,
In which Man has no part;
Which I may hoard, or spend, or loan,
And it shall ease my heart.
And if you ask me whence 'twill come,
And what will be my plan,
I answer that that private sum
Should come—of course—from Man!
I’ll grab it quick, I'll hold it tight,
That welcome L. S. D., -
Concerning which Man's only right
Is—just to give it Me!

COLLAR WORK"; OR, THE UNAPPREGIATED ENTERTAINER.
SCENE–The after-deck of an excursion-steamer, which is on its
return to Scarborough from Bridlington, where the ercursionists
have employed a shining hour in laying in copious luncheons at
various restaurants and eating-houses. Owing to the tide, they
have had to land and re-embark in small boats through a rather
choppy bit of sea, the consequence being that the majority ºf the
party—though not indisposed—are inclined to prefer meditation
to mºping about, probably on the principle of “
dogs lie.” After Flamborough Head has been rounded, a young
man in a frock coat and a cloth .# who has hitherto been
e?
regarded as perfectly inoffensive, sud
plush-covered tables from behind the funnel, and revea
self in the unwelcome character of a professional conjuror.
The Young Man (clearing his throat and 1.% addressing a
group of torpid tourists on the centre seats). Ladies and gentlemen,
with your very kind permission, I
will now endeavour to amuse you by
exhibiting a few simple feats of
ledger de mang to which I invite
your closest attention (the persons
addressed instantly assume, an air
of uneasy abstraction), as I find that
the more carefully my audience
watches my proceedings the less able
they, are to detect the manner in
which the trick is performed. . . .
'ave 'ere, ladies and gentlemen, a
gingerbeer bottle, just a plain stone
. bottle of a pattern no
oubt familiar to you all. (He pro-
duces it, and it appears to be gene-
rally unpopular, as ź. it called up
reminiscences of rerelry which some
would willingly forget.). I will now
pass it around in order that you may
satisfy yourselves that it is what it
appears to be. (To a Somnolent Ex-
cursionist in a corner.) Will you
oblige me, Sir, by kindly taking it

fully). Hang it all, Sir, do you sup-
se I’m any judge, of , gingerbeer
ttles; take the beastly thing away!
The Y. M. (cast down, but unde-
terred). Well, you are all satisfied
that it is an ordinary earthenware
bottle. Now I take this tin case-
made, as you perceive, in two parts
to fit closely round the bottle. I will
just give you an opportunity of 'and-
ling the case so that you may convince yourselves of its being per-
fectly empty. , (He proffers it for inspection, but everybody seems
willing to take it on trust.) I enclose the bottle in the case—so-I make
one or two passes—hey, presto—and, on opening the case, the bottle
will be found to haveyanished. (It has-but nobody appears to regret
its disappearance.) , I close the case, which you all saw to be empty,
once more, and what do I find it contain l (He pulls out yard after
yard of coloured ribbon, which falls absolutely flat, but if the tin
case had emitted a column of smoke and a genuine Arabian djinn, it
would probably fail just now to produce any deep impression.) I
shall next produce a pack of ordinary playing cards, from which I
will ask you, Sir, to be good enough to select a card, without letting
me see it or mentioning which it is (to the Grumpy Excursionist, who
brushes him away irritably as he would a bluebottle). Madam, will
you kindly—? (to the Stout Lady, who turns a shawled shoulder and
feebly requests him “Not to come bothering her”). ...Perhaps you, Sir

cardplaying under any form”). Thank you very much (to a Rubi-

with battered papier-maché heads, and preternaturally
mobile jaws.

depress as many as possible). I now 'ave the pleasure of introducing
to your notice two very old friends of mine, Mr. and Mrs. JEREMLAH

oggle at them with cheerful imbecility.) Well, Mrs. JoRDLES,

contorted by a transitory spasm,

tion that he might have chosen a
more generally agreeable topic, and

innocent dummies). There, Mr. JoB-

to boast that a beautiful young lady he met in Bridlington

resent the statement as an outrage to their intelligence. The

belief in the dummies seems to be shaken, and ut length he

once more, only to gasp in impotent horror the neart
moment, as the irrepressible Young Man returns with a
smaller figure, modelled and dressed to represent an almost
inconceivably repulsive infant. He perches himself on the
bulwark, and placing this doll on his knee, ‘ſ. to con-
verse with it, until its precocity and repeated demands for a
cheesecake render it an object of universal loathing and
detestation. However, its pertness suddenly begins to flag,

unsteadily to his feet,

A CABBY may be this or that; 'e's a chap as the world is much

They're looking about 'em, and passing

wheeze or a joke;
They may look on the lollop, but not on
the sulk, nor they don't 'ang their

the smile sets a mossel askew.

ToMMY 'as reason to know.
Still 'e' as got the gift o' the gab, and no error, 'is yarns when 'e's

Remembers the old body-snatchers, Tom does, and the BURKE and
HARE yarns make you cold as a dab ;
But what 'e reeled out o'er 'is rum-'ot to-night was a gospel-true
tale of a old Haunted Cab.
“Gospel-true, on my davy,” is ToMMY's pet clincher. “Ah, JACK,”

With a forefinger brown as a º: old spike; “you young chirpers

But what 'e most shirked was all haccident cases. Well, Cabbies
don't cotton to them, as a rule,
But BARNEY THE BUNCH* was a bit extry-brutal; a reg'lar old
flint-hearted, foxy-eyed fool.
“Bunched up on 'is box all alone one cold evening, when not a four-

And wy did fares pull BARNEY up on the suddent, and scuttle with

With eyes fixed on—nothink? Yus, nothink, of course ! “ToMMY

Shut up like a rat-trap, and trotted off twist-ways, the “THUMPER”
did, huffed in 'is boozy old style.
A ghost-seer's dignitude does stand on end if 'e twigs that 'is
cackle is met with a smile.
But I didn't grin-not contemphuously, leastways; I've seen fur
too much to be big on the boast,
And this I do know, that your'ard-'earted hunks will one day git 'is

Well, she is a fare as I’d not lose for somethink, though bob-less;

AT the Aquarium the highly trained and well-educated horse,
Alpha, finishes a wonderful performance by being dressed up as a
nurse, and wheeling a pony, Little Beta, about in a perambulator.
Clever Alpha shouldn't be allowed to end by making such a donkey
of himself. One of these days he'll be beaten by little Beta.

THE Poet-LAUREATE STAREs (by “Our
Special Commissioner”).-There is not much
tº choose between the competitors for the
above unimportant fixture. Ever since the
ublication of the weights Sir Edwin Arnold
H. held the position of first favourite. He
appears to have derived no harm from his
recent journey to “India”; indeed, on visit-
ing him at his new quarters in “the Tenth
Mews” we found him in the pink of condi-
tion. Although Mr. Austin has, owing to a
strained caesura, and consequent restriction to
walking exercise, gone back in the betting,
he is, nevertheless, looked upon in some
quarters as a likely candidate; while Sir
Lewis Morris is very much fancied—by him-
self. A somewhat sensational wager of £3000
to £10 was booked against Sir Lewis and
Mr. Henley “coupled.”
CAUTION IN RIGHT DIRECTION.—Dear Mr.
Punch,--The direction written, by a corre-
spondent, on an envelope I found on re-
turning from a short trip, suggested to me
exactly the description of a sly §. (which
I am not), of a young lady (which I am)
who would be a perfect model of propriety
(“that's me”) in her own domestic circle, but
“Forward if away from home !”
There's a nice description 1 So mislead-
ing ! ... I mention this as something to be
aroided by any one writing to a nice girl of
his, or her, acquaintance, and placing special
posting directions on the envelope.
Yours ever, LALAGE.

THE PROBLEM PLAYWRIGHT'S
WADE MEGUM.
Question. Has the Problem Play a
solution?
Answer. Certainly ; it answers
the purposes of the author and the
manaſºer. - - - -
Q. From this I take it that it is
invariably successful? -
A. Well, it is never a failure; or,
rather, hardly ever. -
Q. Can you make your meaning a
little plainer?
A. If it is not invariably a triumph
of coin, it is a success of esteem. The
house is crowded for a couple of
months.
Q. And after P
A. The Problem Play is not ex-
pected to have an after.
Q. What is the essence of such a
creation?
A. The unconventional treatment
of the conventional.
Q. Give an example P
A. Two men tossing up for a lady.
In Boz and Cor the transaction was
conducted with the assistance of a
sixpence in the politest fashion
imaginable; in a later version the
affair could not be arranged without
a pack of cards and much forcible
language. -
Q. Was the scene the same in
both, like the situation?
A. No, in Bor and Cor the spot
was a second-floor back ; in the
other, the interior of an observatory
on the summit of a mountain.
Q. Can you mention, any other
characteristic of the Problem Play?
A.The dramatist should bedaring,
People should say of his work that it
would have tºº their parents
and startled their grandmothers
into fits. - -
Q. How can this desirable end be

. By the playwright causing, his
heroine to throw a pocket-bible into
“DON José.”

the fire, or perform some other act of
parallel .*.*.
Q. Should the heroine have any
peculiarity?
A. As a rule she should be a
woman with a past.
Q. But has not this type been
worked to death?
A. It has certainly seen much
service, so that the newest kind of
heroine is to be preferred.
Q. What is the newest kind of
heroine? -
A. Thewoman who, without having
a past, has, under the influence of
drink, seriously damaged the possi-
bility of enjoying a future. . . .
Q. When does the leading situation
arrive?
A. At the end of the second act.
What goes before and comes after
that climax is, to a large extent, im-
material.
Q: What is the customary fate of
the heroine after the leading situa-
tion ?
A.On rare occasions, suicide"off.”
But the usual exit is a retreat in rear
of the clergy.
Q. What is the customary effect of
the Problem Play?
. A. That for a considerably longer
time than nine days it is a wonder.
Every one talks about it, and many
see it during that period. When the
wonder is exhausted according to
precedent the cause of the amazement
is forgotten.
Q. And, when this last season
arrives, what does the author do?
A. A dramatist, º written
one Problem Play, usually writes
another.
PROFESSIONAL AND Journalistic.
-The Editor of an illustrated paper
says that his only difficulty with
his artists is “the Initial Diffi-
culty.”. He now has on hand an
illustrated alphabet ready for all
emergencies.

A Story ANENT THE NobTH.—According
to the Dundee Advertiser, Colonel NobTH
has E. cash to the King of the BELGIANs,
not for concessions of land near Ostend, but
for similar advantages on the Congo. It has
been rumoured that the purchase-money was
ostensibly (or should it be Ostendsibly P)
handed over for the possession of the former,
and not the latter. But the rumour must be
taken with reserve. Perhaps the report may
have arisen from the fact that the Belgian
watering-place is situated on the North Sea
—a locality naturally associated with the name
of the King of the Nitrates. Be this as it
may, the gallant Colonel is certain to com-
mand the confidence of volunteers in the
future as in the F. So far as he is con-
cerned, shares (plough and other varieties)
will be as popular as bayonets.

THE LATEST LITERARY SUCCESS.
"THE WOMAN WBO WANTED TO.”
A ROMANCE OF THE FUTURE.
CHAPTER I.
THE great reform had been effected. Thanks to the Matrimonial
Tripos Act, passed a few years previously, it was no longer left to
blind chance to decide what women, should receive the privileges of
#."; All those who aspired to them had to enter for the
Tripos held once a year under the supervision of the State, and to
º: a rigorous examination in Household, Arithmetic, Domestic
conomy, Etiquette, and other subjects. Only those who obtained a
first class were allowed to marry noblemen or millionaires, those who
got a second might mate with a peer's younger son or a baronet,
while those hapless ones who failed to get a third were absolutely
prohibited from matrimony, although occasionally one or two who
narrowly missed taking honours were allowed a detrimental by the
examiners. And no maiden was permitted to enter for the examina-
tion more than three times in all.
It was the knowledge of this last fact which cast a shade of troubled
anxiety upon the faces of STREPHON SMITH and AMARYLLIs Jones
as they paced up and down the garden on the eve of the annual
examination. Their engagement had been a long one, for twice had
AMARYLLIS entered for the Tripos, and twice had been hopelessly
ploughed. Should she fail once more on the morrow—
“Nay, my AMARYLLus,” cried the faithful STREPHON, “look not
so downcast. Failure? it is impossible! Have not I coached you
carefully in all the subjects? Come, repeat once more, to give you
confidence, the formulae of poultry-rearing.”
AMARYLL1s smiled sadly, “It is unnecessary,” she replied; “I
remember them well. And yet my mind misgives me. Should that
hateful MELIRQEUs BRown foil us once again—”
“Speak not his name !” exclaimed STREPHoN, grinding his teeth.
“True that he has vowed that we shall never marry; true that at
your first attempt, under the mask of friendship, he inscribed all the
wrong dates upon your dainty cuff, while on the next occasion he
bribed the candidates sitting next to you to jog your elbow and to
upset the ink..over, your papers; but on this occasion he will be
powerless. With the knowledge which, thanks to my assiduous
coaching, you now lº you are certain to pass. A month hence,
my AMARYLLIS, and we shall be wedded.”
AMARYLLIs flung herself into his arms. “If only I am not ploughed 1
But, darling STREPHoN, I have a request to make of you, I implore
you to sit in the gallery to-morrow throughout the examination, and
so, looking up to your face, I shall gain fresh courage.”
“Sweet, I will do so,” oried STREPHon. “And–you know the
deaf-and-dumb * I think? If so, and an answer has slipped
your memory, perhaps—”
“Nay,” said AMARYLLIS, firmly. And we
must run no risks.”
“'Tis unnecessary.
CHAPTER II.
THE great examination had begun. . Ranged at the long rows of
tables sat the fairest of England's maidenhood; some conning the
paper with, painful perplexity, while others scribbled down, the
answers with feverish haste, or gazed iºns'; up to the gallery
whence their anxious lovers regarded them. Amongst these was
plainly visible the heroic form of STREPHON SMITH.
Seated on a dais at the end of the room was Professor PLUMRoss,
the chief examiner, the same who had Fº no fewer than 5428
candidates at the last examination. Perhaps it was the effect of
the constant terror of assassination in which he lived, but on this
particular morning the Professor seemed ill-at-ease. Ever and anon
he pressed his hand firmly on his head, as if he wished to retain a wig
in its place; now and then he fumbled mysteriously with his beard.
Could it be a false one P
But AMARYLLIs had no leisure to observe such trifles. With un-
faltering pen she dashed off the answers to all the questions without
a moment's hesitation, and she had finished a good half-hour before
the º: time. With all her wondrous grace of movement she
tripped lightly up the room, and handed over her, papers to the
Professor. Surely there was an ill-disguised twinkle of elation in
his eyes as he took them. And then, when AMARYLIIS had left, with
her papers in his hand, he edged nearer, and nearer tº the fire-place.
As if by accident, he prepared to drop them into the flames.
Little had he recked that the eagle eye of STEPHoN SMITH was
upon him. With a single bound that intrepid hero leaped from the
gallery to the floor, rushed upon the Professor, with one resolute
sweep.of his hand knocked off his wig, spectacles and false, beard,
and disclosed the pale and trembling features of his hated rival,

CHAPTER III.
AND so the plot was discovered just in time. The nefarious
BRowN had kidnapped the Professor on his way to the hall, had
stolen his robes, and disguised himself so as to § { the part of the
examiner himself. Another minute, and his wicked plan would have
succeeded, AMARYLLIS's papers would have been burnt, and she and
StbePHON would have been separated for ever. Thanks to the
latter's courageous action, the impostor had been detected, and was
subsequently sentenced to several years' imprisonment.
When the real Professor had been liberated and came to look over
AMARYLLis's work, a slight difficulty arose. The law insisted that
one who had answered with such perfect correctness must marry a
peer, while STREPHON was but a humble commoner. However, a
rateful nation rescued him from this dilemma by awarding him a
ukedom.

RoundaBouT READINGS.
A stBANGE report reaches me, a rumour which (if such a course
may be predicated of a mere report) opens up illimitable vistas,
The dramatic critics, it would appear, have been for some time past
in a state of dissatisfaction. A newspaper proprietor has been turned
into a peer; editors in profusion have journeyed down to Windsor as
very plain misters, and, having been tapped upon the shoulder with
cold steel, have returned to the bosoms of their families as knights; a
novelist, a mere teller of stories, has undergone the same process, not,
it is well understood, for his own glory, but for the greater honour
of Literature (capital L please); and, worst of all, an actor has sur:
vived the blood-curdling ceremony of the accolade, and has received
the congratulations and gifts of other members of his profession.
Quas cum ita, sint, the dramatic critics have been very naturally
asking one another why they alone should toil and moil (the “mid-
night oil” irresistibly suggests itself as a pleasing an ..
appropriate rhyme) without any recognition beyond the vulgar one
of a money-payment, sufficient, no doubt, to keep them in bread and
beer, ties, clothes, collars, and cuffs, but utterly inadequate when
considered as a reward for the services they perform on behalf of Artſ|i
and the Drama. One thing led to another (it generally does); there
were conversations, interchanges of ideas, meetings, and so forth;
and eventually matters came to a head in the formation of a society,
the members of which pledged themselves to promote by all legiti-
mate means the claims of dramatic critics to knighthoods, baronetcies,
privy-councillorships, peerages, and other rewards.
THE final meeting, at which the rules were discussed and passed,
and the officials appointed, began harmoniously enough. Mr.
CLEMENT Scott, proposed by Mr. ARCHER, and seconded by Mr.A.
B. WALKLEY, was unanimously voted to the Chair. His opening
speech was marked by great fervour. For years, he said, dramatic
critics had been engaged in the thankless task of Educating the
public taste, and of instructing dramatic authors in the true prin-
ciples of the construction of stage-plays. At last, thank heaven,
they were beginning to be appreciated at their proper value. Their
names were becoming household words. The average reader, when
he opened his World, turned first to the article signed “W. A.”
The same, or a similar person, rushed breathlessly through The
Speaker until he was arrested by the magic initials “A. B. W.”
At this point Mr. ARCHER intervened with the remark that for
himself, he might, say there was only one article, the dramatic,
in the Daily Telegraph that absolutely fascinated, him; and
Mr. WAIKLEY, rising immediately afterwards, observed that, having
studied the essays of M. LEMAiTRE, he had no hesitation in º
that the pungent critiques of the Telegraph were equalled, he woul
not say surpassed, by the masterly aperçus of stage-craft to be found
in Truth and the Illustrated %. News. r. CLEMENT SCOTT
was visibly affected, and having with difficulty mastered his emo-
tion, proceeded to shake both his colleagues by the hand, and in a
voice broken with sobs thanked them for their tributes. He himself,
he added, had endeavoured to make the stalls and the dress circle fit
#. for the flower of English maidenhood, for those beautiful
lushing British girls who were at once the joy of their families an
the pride of our race. He then called upon all the members present
to state what titles they preferred, intimating that, by the express
desire of the committee, he himself was willing to become a Duke.
MR. ARCHER and Mr. WALKLEY having declared their preference
for. Marquisates, Mr. Moy. Thomas said that an Earldom would
satisfy his modest needs. Mr. BENDALL thought, Wiscount sounded
attractive, and chose that title; while Mr. A. E. T. WAtson inti-
mated that all he wanted was to be a Baron—Baron BADMINToN of
BEAUFORT. Mr. BERNARD SHAw stood by his life-long principles,
and declined everything except a Privy-Councillorship. Various
other gentlemen having spoken, and a complete list of titles having
been arranged, the meeting was about to adjourn, when Mr. CLEMENT
Scott rose again to make a few parting observations.
“My Lords,” he began amidst deafening applause, “it only
remains for me to state briefly the principles by which we shall
be guided. We shall not truckle to the nauseating rubbish
purveyed by any Norwegian charlatan.” What else he would have
said must for ever remain a matter of guess-work, for at this point
he was immediately set upon by Lord ARCHER, and torn forcibly
from his chair. Baron, BADMINToN, however, gallantly came to His
Grace's assistance, and a scene of indescribable confusion ensued.
Strawberry leaves were torn to tatters, and several handsome property
coronets were ruthlessly trampled under foot. Order was, however,
at last restored by the arrival of Sir HENRY IRVING with a strong
force of dramatic authors armed with problem-plays. In the conflict
that followed many heads were broken, but eventually the hall was
cleared. It is understood that, notwithstanding this deplorable
incident, the agitation is to be vigorously pursued. I shall publish
any further information that may reach me.
SIR. E. CLARKE AND THE BAR–AN EXPLANATION,
SIR,-The paper you edit with so much advantage to the public
is the recognised organ of the legal profession. This being so, I
appeal to you on behalf of the Bar. Sir, it will not have escaped
your attention that on a recent occasion Sir EDWARD CLARKE, in
returning thanks for his colleagues of the Law. List, referred to the
custom observed by some counsel of accepting briefs indiscriminately.
The ex-Solicitor-General (shortly, I trust, to become “Mr. Attorney”)
related an anecdote concerning the last of the Barons—Mr. Baron
HUDDLESTONE -
—to the follow-
ing effect. You
ill remember
that Sir ED-
wARD, when
only a stuff-
gown mºn, was
* with ” the
eminent Ben-
cher of Gray's
Ian in a Case.
“I trust, Mr.
CLARKE,” said
the coming Ba-
ron's assistant
to the then pro-
mising Junior,
“that you will
be able to at-
tend to it if
Mr. HUDDLE-
STONE fails to
put in an ap-
pearance.” “I
suppose,” re-
lied the future
ir EDWARD,
“ that Mr.
HUDDLESTONE
is not coming.”
“Well, he may
be away,” was
the reply, “be-
cause to-day he
has briefs in
thirteen other
actions.” Then
Sir EDWARD
wittily ex- SQ
plained that -
the fault, lay -
with the public.
Suitors could
select their own advocates, and there were plenty of men practising
at the Bar who would gladly accept a brief, for a very moderate fee,
should the services of a better-known colleague be retained in some
other matter. Mr. ex-Solicitor is perfectly right. There are such
men. For instance, I myself, should Sir EdwahD wish it, would
willingly assist him. If he has an overflow of pink-tape tied parcels,
let him send them to me, and I will give them my best attention.
I shall be delighted to pick up, so to speak, the documentary crumbs
that fall from his brief-encumbered table. But that is a matter
which chiefly concerns Sir Edward and myself. It is not entirely
with a view to making the above suggestion that I address you. No,
Sir, I have other than personal interests at heart.
I am convinced that, although every counsel has the right to be
“retained ” in every case, but a comparative few exercise the
º: I have known the late Serjeant PARRY (with whom I
ave had the honour to act—while taking a note in the temporary
absence of a learned friend-on more than one occasion) return his
brief, with its accompanying honorarium, when unable to attend to
the former, and thus earn the latter. Speaking for myself, I made
it a rule, shortly after I was called, never to “devil” in two places
at once. But to come to the point. As a matter of fact—and a grain
of true testimony is better than a ton of theory—I can deliberately
declare that, during a long forensic experience, extending over
several decades, I have never had two cases on the same day. And
what has been my experience no doubt has been the experience of
many others. I would not for worlds have it thought that I neglect my
duty because I have a plethora of professional work. And here I must
stop, as I have to give my most careful attention to a consent brief,
which appears to me to bristle with technical difficulties. However,
as I am desired to acquiesce, I shall no doubt carry out my client's
instructions with the customary formalities.

HOW KIPPER SLEW THE NEW FOREST HORNET.
CHAPTER I.-The Recluse.
. ONCE upon a time there was a little goblin called KIPPER, who
lived the life of a hermit in a hollow oak-tree in the New Forest.

he had been robbed by an unscrupulous brother of a valuabl” ºr ºn
mine, situated under Hengistbury
Head; others, that he had been
crossed in love; while there was
a third party in Fairydom which
stoutly maintained that he had
been expelled from Goblinland on
account of his desire to upset the
king and *: and establish a
republic. e that as it may,
KIPPER was no favourite in the
country of his exile. Not that he
need have been unsociable, for,
when he first arrived, the greatest
attention was paid to him by his
neighbours. The most important
rsonages in Fairydom called upon
im, he received invitations to the
Court balls, and he was bidden to
several jolly bachelor parties given
by the elves on the sward which
surrounds Rufus's Stone.
But KIPPER made no response to
these advances. He showed that
he meant.tº be unsociable, and,
little by little, the notabilities ard
landed gentry ceased to take any
notice of him. Occasionally some
of the sportsmen of the Court, when
out hunting the slow-worms and the
bumble-bees, would come across

nothing of taking a clump of dock

thick bush of prickly gorze. It
cannot be said that the stagbeetle
enjoyed the jumping as much as
his master did; but inasmuch as
the gnome had broken him in at
an early age, and never, rode with-
out a pair of stout hawthorn pricks
on his heels and a bramble switch
in his hand, the coal-black steed
had to make the best of a bad

KIPPER had partaken somewhat
too freely of some fine wild #.
which he had found in an old *
an accident occurred to the reckless,
rash rider. On his way home he
had to pass by Stoney Cross, and
it so happened that the road was
being mended, and a huge heap
of granite lay, by the wayside.
Nothing would satisfy. KIPPER but that he must leap this mound,
and so he told the stagbeetle to put forth, all his strength; The poor
creature besought his master not to risk both their lives, but KIPPER
was as hard as a pond after a six weeks frost. Gathering, his rush-
reins in his hands, and ramming the hawthorn pricks into the sides of
the stagbeetle, he cried, “Hi!, over,” and went for the granite.
The stagbeetle did his best, but just before he made his effort he
faltered in his stride. The next moment he was kicking out with his

‘weatheR PERMITTING,”—MR. PUNCH DRIVEs To THE FIRST MEET. ...
THE MINISTER OF FINE ARTS.
(From a Newspaper of the Future.)
MANY years ago, in 1895, our esteemed contemporary, the Daily
Graphic, suggested the appointment of a Minister of Fine Arts.
This seemingly admirable scheme was soon after carried out. The
first Minister was a cautious man. His one great improvement,
which met with universal approval, was to remove all the statues
and fountains from every part of London, and to place them in a row
on Romney Marsh, from Dungeness to Hythe, where they would
undoubtedly scare away any French army endeavouring to land.
The second Minister tried to introduce the so-called “Queen Anne,”
or Dutch architecture, and prepared a scheme for altering the whole
of London. As a beginning, the north side of Oxford Street, from
Holborn to the Marble Arch, was completely transformed. Along
the whole distance stretched a fantastic row of red-brick buildings,
the surface of which was diversified at every possible point by useless
little windows, and little arches, and little projections, and little
recesses and little balustrades. These had risen to the level of the
second floors, when a change of Government brought in a Minister
who believed only in English architecture of the fifteenth century.
Under his directions the new buildings were therefore continued in
stone, in imitation of the Houses of Parliament, but the work was
stopped by his death. His successor, though of course, one of the
Gothic party, preferred the Gothic architecture of Italy, and the
upper Fº of the houses were therefore finished in that style.
As at that time the reduction of the Budget was urgently needed,
it was decided to use painted stucco instead of real marble, as in
Italy.
When the next Government came into office all the houses on the
South side of Oxford Street were pulled down, and everyone said
that at last we should have an imposing row of buildings. Un-
fortunately a difficulty arose. The new Minister of Fine Arts was
only interested in gardening, and hardly knew one style of archi-
tecture from, another. He could not therefore decide, the great
question whether the new houses should correspond with the opposite
ones, and, if so, whether they should be “Queen Anne,” or #.
Gothic, or English Perpendicular in style. The controversy raged
for months. Every person interested said, or wrote, what he
thought, or knew, or did not think, or did not know, about architec-
ture, and taste, and art in general...The Academy of Arts, the
Society of Antiquaries, and the Institute of Architects, hitherto
sedate bodies, became so excited that free fights occurred almost daily
in the neighbourhood of Burlington House, and on the waste land in
Oxford Street. In every newspaper “The Improvement of Oxford
Street” was discussed vigorously. Suddenly the current of public
opinion was turned in another direction by a lamentable event. The
inister of Fine Arts, returning from his weekly inspection of the
maiden-hair ferns on Wormwood Scrubs, was killed in a cab accident
in Vigo Street, a miserably narrow turning, which had escaped the
º: of everyone but the cabmen, who always prefer the narrowest
streets.
At once there arose a universal *ś safety and space were more
important than style. The new Minister was beginning to widen
some of the narrow thoroughfares, when his party went out of office.
WOL. CD -
The work has not been continued by the present Minister, who is
considering a scheme for the improvement of London by the erectiºn
of fountains and statues. Meanwhile the Oxford Street site is still
vacant, and no improvements are attempted elsewhere. Half of
Vigo Street has been made the same width as Burlington Gardens;
the other half remains, as before, about fifteen feet across from
house to house. - -
Our esteemed contemporary, the Daily. Graphic, always alive to
the artistic needs of the age, remarks that it is impossible to regulate
art by Acts of Parliament, or to improve, London by party govern;
ment, and therefore suggests that the Ministry of Fine Arts should
be abolished.
SCRAPS FROM CHAPS.
BoARD AND REsidence.—Here is a gem from the Bandon Quarter
Sessions. Their Medical Officer of Health, Dr. MAGNER, was suing
the Guardians of the Clonakilty Union for failing to erect a fence
round the Dispensary residence:–
Counsel argued that the true cause of all this was that Dr. MAGNER
happened to be a gentleman of independent mind, who had not, like others
in the same position, the savoir faire to cuddle guardians.
His Honour. Do you mean to say that any unfortunate medical officer has
to cuddle boards of guardians? A very unpleasant duty certainly.
Mr. Powell. Well, they had to attend the meetings, and, perhaps, stand
drinks, and things of that kind. (Laughter.)
Who would not be such a Medical Officer
Fractised in keeping his Board well in hand? -
D'you think that he offers them cocoa or coffee, Sir?
No; but it’s whisky he's called on to “stand.”
Paupers fall ill, and his task is to cure 'em.;
In fights with infection he comes up to time;
'Gainst bad sanitation he's paid to secure 'em ; -
His drains may be poor, but his “drinks” must be prime.
Is any Guardian cantankerous? He “cuddles” him
(So did a Counsel obscurely declare); -
And should this fail, then his "Irish hot” fuddles him;
For what is a doctor without “savoir faire” ”
The WATER-BANDITs AGAIN 1–Not content with spoiling the
Falls of Foyers, the Aluminium Company now threatens an attack
on the Falls of Clyde. Oh, what a § is there, my countrymen
exclaims the patriotic Scot. The Co. that dares to lay its hands on
Clyde, save in the way of kindness, is a willum, and should be wound
up instanter. Says the North British Daily Mai–
The times are distinctly utilitarian and prosaic, and yet we have not all
progressed up, or down, to the level of the man who sees nothing in a grand
cataract beyond so much horse-power running to waste.
Neatly put, and even from a utilitarian standpoint it may be well
to .#. that as much money may be brought into Scotland by a
thousand tourists wanting to view the Falls, as by a single company
wanting to ruin them.

THE ENGLISH WIFE.
[MAx O'RELL says that the English wife sits
opposite to her husband at the fireside in the
evening with her curl-papers in her hair.]
AIR-" She wore a Wreath of Roses."
SHE wore a wreath of roses,
The night when first we met;
Her hair, with careful oiling,
Looked shiny, black, and wet.
Her footsteps had the lightness
f—say a mastodon;
And oh!, she look exceeding smart,
Though high of hue—and bone.
I saw her but a moment,
Yet methinks I see her now
With the slimness, style and lightness
Of-say a Low Dutch Wrowl
A wreath of orange blossoms
When next we met she wore,
The spread of form and features
Was much greater than before.
And standing by her side was one
Who strove, and strove in vain,
To make believe that such a wife
Was a domestic gain.
I saw her but a moment,
Yet methinks I see her now, ..
With her big front teeth projecting,
A queer blend of horse and cow.
And once again I see that brow—
No bridal wreath is there—
A ring of curl-papers conceals
What's left of her scant hair.
She sits on one side of the hearth,
Her spouse, poor man, sits near, .
And wonders how that scarcecov thing
Could once to him be dear!
- - - -
I wondered, and departed,
Yet methinks I see her now
That type of British wifehood,
With the corkscrews round her brow!

LETTERS FROM A FIANCEE.
MY DEAR MARJoRIE,-Since I wrote to
you last, ARTHUR has developed unmistak-
able signs of acute jealousy. . Bluebeard

childishly unsuspicious. At first, I liked it,
and was flattered; but it is now beginning to
be a little wearing. Also, I find that it has
the effect of making me ridiculously and
unjustifiably vain; catching, as it were, from
ARTHUR, the idea that everyone I meet must
necessarily admire me, and would like to take
his place. A quite absurd instance of this has
just happened, of which I am rather ashamed.
My cousin FREDDY, who is staying with us
in the country, has a musical friend, called
PERCIVAL, for whose talents and accomplish-
ments FREDDY has the greatest possible ad-
miration. Having got permission to bring
him down, FREDDY instantly dragged him to
the piano and insisted on his playing and
singing a song which went like this: —
“The people call me DAIs Y,
Little DAisy, with the dimple,
And all the boys are fond of me
Because I am so simple,” &c.
We were all charmed, except ARTHUR, and
except PERC1VAL himself. PehcIvaL com-

thought otherwise; to ARTHUR, PERCIVAL
seemed a Don Juan, a gay Lothario, a very
Lovelace, the most dangerous of, young trou-
badours. And he glared—really, glared is
the only word—so much while I talked to
r young PERCIVAL that I, also, actually
egan to think there must be something in
it; and, from mischief, I talked to him the
more. After dinner, we danced. To tease
ARTHUR, who was snubbing everyone and
locking sulky, I couldn't resist sitting in the
conservatory a little while with FREDDy's
friend. True, my conversation with, this
reckless Rizzio might have been, word for
word, carried on between two provincial old
ladies: and yet, the knowledge that ARTHUR
wouldn't have believed it, gave a sort of
imaginary romantic wickedness to the whole
thing. . He asked me if I had read Trilby,
and said he had, curiously enough, never
seen the Shop Girl. We agreed, that though
we didn't much like the winter, still it was
certainly a nice change after the summer.
We had reached this point, when ARTHUR
came into the conservatory; I rose, so did
PERCIVAL, and at the same time he handed
me a little piece of paper on which he had,
while he ed, been writing something in
pencil. . . ;, I walked away...with.ARTHUR,
mechanically squeezing the little bit of paper
in my hand.

letter that young :* you?”
Becoming frightened, I denied that he had
given me a letter, slipped it into my mouth
and slowly ate it. ... We had a scene. f
cried; we made it up, and he gave me a new
brooch afterwards. -
The next day I seized an opportunity to
tell PERCIVAL that he mustn't do such things,
as it made ARTHUR very angry, and also to
ask what was on the piece of paper. ... He
looked at me. “ y, Miss GLADrs,” he
said, “didn't you show it to your future
husband P”
“What was it?” I asked, timidly.
“It was my publisher's address. "You said
you would like to have some of my songs,

is peace again.

Hugely content is the Baron with a
book published by SMITH, ELDER & Co.,
and writ by one “JACK EASEL,” some
time a frequent contributor to Mr.
Punch's pages. The title of the work
is “Our Square and Circle.”. All is
written “on the square,” and that the
matter, is “non-contentious” is evident, as otherwise, the author
would be “arguing in a circle,” which is absurd; or “in a vicious
circle,” which would of course utterly take away the reputation of
his quiet square for eminent r tability. That it is pleasantly
written, the reader will find out for himself; that it was a labour of
love, and therefore Easel-y writ, goes without saying. The Baron
joins issue with him oncertain details as to the table, the wines, and
dinners generally; though up to now he should have thought himself
at one with him [or “at 7.45 with him,” which is the more likely

PLEASURE AND PROFIT.
[It has recently been suggested in the Author that novelists should take
the management of their books entirely into their own hands.]
HAPPENING to call lately on my friend SN00ks, the eminent
novelist, I was rather surprised at the change which had come over
the appearance of his drawing-room. The books, which had been
scattered over the table in former days, were now methodically
arranged along the shelves which covered the entire walls, and in
the corner, where a china cabinet had formerly stood, there now
figured a sort of counter, behind which stood SNooks himself,
arrayed in his shirt-sleeves.
“Ha!” he exclaimed, as I entered, “what can I have the pleasure
of showing you to-day ? Romances, poetry, travels–"
“Why, SNooks,” I said, “don’t you remember me? What on

... Snooks's face fell somewhat. “Oh, it's you, is it? I thought
it was a customer. You see that I’ve taken the Author's advice,
and am managing my own affairs.”
“Indeed? And how in the world—”
“ Hush ' ' the novelist interrupted. “Here are some customers.”
And as he spoke four or five people entered the drawing-room, and
marched up to the counter.
“A nice novel, Madam,” said Snooks, just like one of Messrs.
MARSHALL AND ŠNegrove's young men. “Certainly. Kindl

my favourite productions; but I can sell you a rather milder blend,
if you prefer it.”
And so the conversation went on, until all the customers had been
satisfied, and SNooks wi his heated brow and turned to me.
“There, you see how it works; splendid system, isn't it? No
trouble with publishers or booksellers, entirely a ready-money trade,
done ovel the counter in one's own drawing-room.”
Then all these books are your own work?” I asked.

SPORT PER WIRE,
[An international revolver match by cable is arranged to take place shortly
between English and American teams.]
“Good morning,” said a representative of Mr. Punch to the
Chief Umpire of a well-known Telegraphic Agency; “I have come
to ask if you would kindly favour me with some details of your
new Sporting Department.”
“Certainly,” he replied. “It has a great future before it. We
intend to revolutionise sport in all its branches.” -
“For instance?”

“Why, at this desk, of course. You
see, we cable over to the Associated Press
full particulars of the imaginary kick-
off, and they look it out in the Code—
which doesn’t generally take more than
ten minutes—and wire back their return
kick (also imaginary), with name, #: &
weight, and address of the kicker. This
is generally repeated as a security against
the risk of error. The charge for re-
petition is one-half the charge for trans-
mission, any fraction of one penny less
than a halfpenny being reckoned as one
h nny, according to the admirable
ing of the Post Office rules.”
“And then?” - - -
“We wrangle for the rest of the time. This is quite in keeping
with the modern spirit of football, the game now having developed
into a kind of Hibernian debating society.”
“But how was it you won to-day?”
“Oh, we had the last word before ‘Time’ was called, which enabled
our Sporting Editors to prove conclusively that the first kick scored a
goal, and was not “offside.” Our American colleagues, however, have
appealed to the Central International Committee of Football Referees,
so that the wires will be kept warm for the next half-year on the
subject in the most sportsman-like manner.”
... Capital!. And have you any other telegraphic developments?”
“Oh yes! There's our Ladies' Inter-Varsity Stay-at-Home Hockey

THE MUSIC HALL AS OTHERS
WOULD SEE IT.
(With compliments to those it may concern )
THE entrepreneur had conducted the visitor
here, there, and everywhere. He had shown
the stage, the auditorium, and the tea and
cake-room. Every feature of the reformed
scheme had been duly explained.
“No singing allowed in the entertain-
ment?” queried the visitor.
“None at all,” was the reply; we con-
sider that music is a iº. Of course
some songs are good, but as others are bad
it is better to prohibit them altogether, and
thus escape the risk of a mistaken choice.”
“And no dancing P’’
“Of course not. That would be entirely
contrary to our principles. If people require
exercise they can walk or run.’
“But how about the poetry of motion?
How about the grace of movement *"
“We desire to have nothing to do with
either,” returned the entrepreneur. “You
see our object is to have an entirely new
entertainment, and consequently we reject
all items that have figured in other pro-
grammes.”
“Well, well,” murmured the visitor;
“you may be right. But I should like to
see the result. will wait until the per-
formance is given, and judge for myself.”
“I am sorry I cannot assist you to carry
out this scheme,” declared the Manager of
the Progressive Music Hall, “because we are
not going to have an entertainment.”
“No, of course not. Of course it won't be
an entertainment in the usual sense of the
word. It can't naturally be an entertain-
ment—I should have said a performance.”
“But we give neither entertainment nor
performance.” “Why not?”
Then came the answer, which was more
convincing than surprising-" Because, my
dear Sir, we can't get an audience!”
THE New Hotel, on THE EMBANKMENT.-
Our Dear Daily News, in a recent note, says
that the “Hôtel Magnifique” (as it ought to
be called, reminding us as the D. D. N.
justly observes of the Hôtel Splendide in
Paris) has been already styled by its pro-
prietors The Cecil, “The Cecil!”—“There
is only one in it,” observes bluntly a certain
well-known comedian, quoting the song
“There’s only one in it, that's me!” And
pleased is ARTHURCECIL with the gratuitous
advertisement. But The Cecil / Good name
for club, not for hotel. The Sarum sounds
too ecclesiastical; so we return to The Magnº-
ficent, which can be familiar in our mouths
as “The Mag.” “Omne ignotum pro mag-
nifico.”
“ODD noticel" observed a short-sighted
man, who had been cursorily inspecting a
card stuck up in a Restaurant's. “Whatis?”
inquired his friend. “Why this,” was the
short-sighted one's reply, pointing to the
notice; “No charge for changing plates.
Who ever heard of—” But here his friend
broke in, “Why, you noodle, you’ve been
reading a photographer's advertisement!”

new play at the
“C. C. C.,” or
CoMYNs CARR's

Mr. PIN E R 0
calls it The

is supposed to
be a quotation
from the
Judge's sum-
ming up in the
Divorce Court
in the case of
Allingham v.
A l l in g h a m.
Mrs. . Alling-
ham has sued
for a divorce
in consequence
of her hus-
band's miscon-
duct with Mrs.
Fraser; the
misconduct was
not proved, but
the Judge was
so severe on the
conductof Mrs.

tained from the

Mr. P-n-ro (making up after the portrait ºf Ibsen). “Ah! * *ś".
I think I’m getting uncommonly like him.” the cheerful
subject Mr. PINERQ, in Ibsenitish vein, has chosen, and he has
written a series of dramatic scenes artistically developing his
characters by the most natural dialogue possible, but not, as it
seems to me, by means either most natural, or most probable. The
t situation of the piece is brought about by a gentleman (in the
est sense of the word, as far as we can judge up to this º per-
mitting, his infernally jealous wife—there is no other epithet for her
except “infernally”—to conceal herself on purpose to overhear a
conversation between himself and her supposed rival! Analogous
situations in broad farce, and farcical comedy are frequent and per-
missible: but surely not in a drama of real life. But then, I remind
me, that this drama is Ibsenitish; which does make a difference.
The play is far too long, but it is admirably written and admirably
acted. The dramatist intends most of his leading characters to be
repulsively sordid, vulgar, and selfish, and those who are not so are
amiable, but weak. The first heroine, Fº *...* by Miss
WINIFRID EMERY, is a fast member of a fast family as badly
brought up as La famille. Benoiton, the vain, frivolous mother
being well portrayed by Miss LINDLEY ; and the second heroine,
inably represented by Miss LILY HANBURY, is simply an odious,
ealous shrew, and the prospect of happiness in a “place unmention-
able to ears polite” would be more probable than any happiness for a
husband with a wife like this. With neither heroine is sympathy
sible. Another splendid comedy performance is that of Miss
ose Leclercq, as the Bishop's wife, a character whose original is to
to be found in ANTHoNY TROLLOPE's Barchester Towers, from
which I will quote a specimen passage, and ask those who have seen
The Benefit of the Doubt whether it does not sum up in brief Mr.
PINERO's characters of Mrs. Cloys and her husband the Bishop.–
“What did you say about it, Bishop º' asks Mrs. Proudie of her husband.
“Why,” replies “her little man,” “I said that I thought that if, that is,
should I-should the dean die—that is, I said I thought—” As he went
on. *ins and floundering, he saw that his wife's eye was fixed sternly
On Illin.
“What will become of
And these, with the stage directions, are the £gh: Rev. Dr.
Cloys and Mrs. Cloys of St. Qlpherts,” and not of “Barchester”
—that’s all. And this Mrs. Proudie-Cloys serves as a Dea er
machină coming forward to offer temporary relief to the hard,
austere hus Mr. Fraser (also a ºperformance by Mr. J. G.
GRAHAME), from his very trying wife. The Bishop is, oddly enough,
a mere “lay” figure; and is “left till called for” at the last moment.
Having already said that the acting all round is of first-class
i. it will be superfluous to single out Mr. LEONARD BoyNE for
special praise. . Yet he deserves it... Had the author given this
character an Irish title, the combination would have been perfect.
Mr. CYRII, MAUDE, as the fussy, empty-headed M.P., adds another
finished picture to his eccentric portraitures; but Mr. PINERo might
have refrained from, adding to this personage's eccentricities one
which originated with Mr. CHARLEs Kºjº, Beadless Man,
whose system of memoria tech-
nica, and recalling things by
initial letters, Mr. PINERo seems
to have borrowed, in order to
complete Sir Fletcher Port-
wood's equipment for the stage.
It is as well to note this, lºst
by unconscious cerebration Mr.
INERo should, in some future
piece, develope Sir Fletcher in-
to another. Mr. Hedley, and
refer to Sir Fletcher in this
piece as his original.
The only pleasant scene is
where, in the Second Act, two
club 'º. Denzil . Shafto
(Mr. J. W. PIGoTT) and Peter
Elphick (Mr. STUARTCHAMPION)
appear, the latter with a banjo;
both coming to cheer up their
unhappy friend Misther Alling-
ham. These two lighten up the
gloom of the Second Act for a
brief space, and then are heard
no more ; yet the scene in
which they strut their short
ten minutes on the stage is
one of the best imagined, and
best stage-managed as regards
“business,” in a piece where
every detail has been considered
and not a point lost. For acting,
for dialogue, for character(grant-
ing these to be what the author
of their being has made them),
this unpleasant play ranks with
the best of the dramas from,
what Mrs. Malaprop might
term, “The Pinerian spring.”
And the end ? Nothing ; a
blank. The audience look at one
another and say, “Well—and -
then P. . . What next P” It º a "ſº

of which the author and manager may find a satisfactory solution.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI,
FIRST IN THE FIELD.
WEATHER BREAKs. DELIGHTFUL PROsPECT | GoING STRONG !
ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
I HAVE been staying recently at Oxford, the home of perennial
youth-and of innumerable dogs. In fact, it was the canine aspect
of Oxford that impressed me on this occasion more than any other.
Nearly every self-respecting undergraduate keeps his dog, and the
mediaeval, academic look of the place is pleasantly tempered by these
careless, happy, intrusive, “warlike wearers of the wagging tail,”
who career up the High, make the meadows to resound with their
barkings, and bring the bicycled rowing coach to eternal smash on
the tow-path. There being, roughly speaking, some 3,000 under-
ſº the floating population of Oxford dogs cannot be less
an 2,500.
. PERHAPs, however, the most remarkable thing about Oxford dogs
is the variety of their migrations. Some dogs, of course, remain
constant to one owner. Others spend their lives under the general
ownership of the whole University. These know the best rooms for
bones from term to term; they can track the perfumed ash-pan, to
its lair, and indulge in hideous orgies of fish-heads and egg-shells.
The most prominent representative of this class is, of course, Oriel |f
Bill, who has, perhaps, the most gorgeously ugly and tenderly
pathetic face ever granted by nature to a bull-dog.
BUT ordinary dogs, though they remain nominally the possession
of one original owner, migrate from sub-owner to deputy-sub-owner,
and thence to pro-deputy-sub-owner, with a wonderful i";
For instance, I, once gave a retrieyer § to an Oxford friend.
This is the life-history of that amiable animal, so far as I can gather
it up to a recent date,
A. (my friend) kept the dog faithfully for a term. As he was
going down, it occured to A. that Ponto would be happier in Oxford
than in London, so when the following term began, Ponto, still in
his gay *Prº. was once more found in Oxford under a different
master, B. B. kept Ponto in his lodgings in the High. They were
prettily furnished; there were cretonnes, and embroidered cushions,
and handsome rugs. One day Ponto was left in solitary charge for
one short hour. Upon B.'s, return he found that remarkable dog
sleeping soundly, with a well-gnawed slipper under each of his fore-
paws, amidst a ruin of tattered stuffs. Not a hanging, not a cushion,
not a rug remained entire. This was too much, and Ponto promptly
became the fleeting property of C., a Balliol man, who changed his
name to Jowler (this happened in the time of the late Master), and
taught him to worry cats.
AFTER three weeks of glorious scrimmages amongst the surround-
ing feline inhabitants, Jowler took it into his head to get lost for a
week. C, mourned him, but tºok no further steps when É. found him
living under the*...* of D., a Brasenose man, totally unknown
to A., the original owner...D. took him home in the vac, broke him
to the , imbued him with an extraordinary fondness for beer, and
re-christened him “ Hebby.”
At the beginning of the following term Hebby once more turned
up in Oxford, being then almost a full-grown dog. He again lived
in lodgings, this time in Turl Street; By this time he had acquired
luxurious habits, and was particularly fond of taking his naps in any
bed that might be handy. Having on four separate occasions
covered himself with mud and ensconced himself in the bed of the
landlady, he was not as popular as a dog of his ought to have
been. But the culminating point was reached when Hebby, having
stolen a cold pheasant and the remains of a leg of mutton, took the
bones to the bed of his master, into which he tucked himself. After
this he was passed on to E., a Magdalen man, and was called The Pre.
I CANNOT follow his "...ºf after this point in any detail. I
know he has gone the round of the Colleges twice. He has been
a boating dog, a cricketing dog, an athletic dog, and a footballing
dog. He has been a canine member of Vincent's Club; he has
waited outside the Union unmoved while a debate, on which
the fate of the Ministry hung, was in progress. He has been
smuggled into College, he has disgraced himself, and caused a change
of carpets in nearly every lodging in Oxford. He has lived near
New College under the name of Spoo, has been entered at Christ
Church as Fleacatcher (a delicate compliment to distinguished oars-
man), and has frequented the precincts of the Radcliffe Infirmary,
and been joyfully hailed as Pego by budding doctors. I believe he
is still a resident member of the University, but his exact place of
residence is more than I can tell. His original owner endeavoured
to trace him not long ago. He got as far as Lincoln College, and
there lost the clue.
THIS, I am sure, is no solitary example. Hundreds of Oxford
dogs are at this very time undergoing the same vicissitudes, through
a similar Odyssey of wanderings. And probably, if the truth were
known, there are Cambridge dogs in no better case.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
wº LIKE it muchly,” quoth the Baron, finishing BARING Gould's
Oenº --
“This scribe for publishers ne'er writes in vain;
His pen prolific, Baring Goulden grain.”
And Noëmi, if a trifle less Gouldish than Weymanish, is a tale of
stirring times, when to plunder, hack, stab, and string up a few
unfriendly fellow-creatures, who would have ãone the same by you if
the turn of luck had been theirs, came in the
day's work; while to roast an offender whole
“all alive Ö,” just for once and away, was, so
to speak, “quite a little º as a special &
and exceptional treat. , And all these jocular
barbarities were occasioned, not by any reli-
gious fervour, or by intolerant persecuting
zeal, excusing itself on the score of anxiety for
uture spiritual welfare of victim, but simply
out of pure cussedness, and for the humour of /
the thing, much as, now-a- flºyº, the bowie- ſº
knife and the cord are used “down West.”
Personally, the Baron gives not full credit to "
all these tales of mediaeval cruelty, but the
“scenes and properties” serve an excellent
artistic purpose, and so he loves them as he
loves such romances as those of She who
must be obeyed, and Treasure Island. There-
fore here's to the lass Noémi, and, as she
herself would of course say, in response to
the toast, “You’ll like me the more you Know-o'-me.”
Another capital story by FRANK BARRETT, entitled, A. Set of
Rogues, is strongly recommended by the faculty; the faculty in ques-
tion being that of deciding upon what sort of book is certain to suit
the tastes of the majority of romance-readers, who, aweary of the
lodding every-day business in this “so-called nineteenth century,”
É. to get away from it occasionally and live, just for a change, in
the seventeenth. Stirring tale this of A Set of Rogues, without a
ull chapter in it: and just º human sentiment in it to soften
down the roguery. In fact, so skilfully is the tale, told that the
reader will find himself siding with, “their knavish tricks”;, for
the hearts of these rogues are in the right place, though their
bodies very seldom were, and their heads never, in the noose. But
‘... no noose is good noose,” and so let the honest reader procure
the book from INNEs & Co. of Bedford Street; he will come to
love the scoundrels, and will ask, with the Baron, “What on earth
became of that captivating. Don Sanchez º. and, another query,
“Was the villainous old Steward really killed?” Perhaps the
author is reserving the Don and the Steward for another romance.
If so, “What will he do with 'em P’’ asks the
INTERESTED BARON DE B.-W.

WHEN at the porch he turned,
To take a last fond look.
(Human emotion will have way

He listened to the tramp,
So familiar to his ear;
And the soldier gripped his good old sword,
And wiped away a tear.
Not far from that same porch
A Tommy stood at ease,
But, as he saw, his head braced up,
And he stiffened at the knees.
“Sorry to lose you, Sir!
You’ve been our friend, and dear!”

Be wiped away a tear.
Both turned, and left the spot,
Oh! do not deem them weak,
For dauntless was each soldier's heart,
Though a tear bedeved each cheek.

A YELL FROM THE YELLOW.
THE “Yellow Dwarf” (in the Yellow Book),
in an almost incoherent scream against the

as follows:–
“The bagman and the stockbroker's clerk (and
their lady wives and daughters) 'ave usurped his
(the ‘gentleman and scholar’’s) plyce, and his
influence on readers; and the pressman has picked
up his fallen pen—the pressman, Sir, or the press-
woman . . . With an illiterate reading mob howl-
ing at our doors, and a tribe of pressmen scribbling
at our tables, what, in the name of the universe,
can we expect? What we get; not so?”
Well, “what we get” is (among other
things) the above shriek of the “Yellow
Dwarf,” who seems to do his full share of
the “howling” he attributes to the “reading
mob,” and who, indeed, might be better de-
scribed as the “Yeller Dwarf.”

LEAVES FROM THE HIGHLAND JOURNAL OF TOBY, M.P.
FIRST LEAF.—THE THING TO DO IN SCOTLAND.
Quiverfield, Haddingtonshire, Monday.—You can't spend twenty-
four hours at Quiverfield without having borne in upon 6. the
truth that the only thing to do in Scotland is to play goff. (On other
side of Tweed they call it golf. Here we are too much in a hurry
to get at the game to spend time on unnecessary consonant.) The
waters of what WICTOR Hugo called “The First of the Fourth” lave
the links at Quiverfield. Blue as the Mediterranean they have been
in a marvellous autumn, soon to lapse into November. We can see
the Bass Rock from the eighth hole, and can almost hear the whirr
of the balls skimming with swallow flight over the links at North
Berwick.
PRINCE ARTHUR here to-day, looking fully ten years younger than
when I last saw him at Westminster. Plays through live-long day,
and drives off fourteen miles for dinner at Whittinghame, thinking
no more of it than if he were crossing Palace Yard. Our host,
WAVERLEY PEN, is happy in possession of links at his park gates.
All his own, for self and friends. You step through the shrubbery,
and there are the far-reaching links; beyond them the gleaming
waters of the Forth. Stroll out immediately after breakfast to meet
the attendant caddies; play goff till half-past one; reluctantly break
off for luncheon; go back to complete the fearsome foursome; have
tea brought out to save time; leave off in bare time to dress for
dinner; talk goff at dinner; arrange matches after dinner; and the
new morning finds the caddies waiting as before.
Decidedly the only thing to do in Scotland is to play goff.

. “Must be going now,” says FINGEN, M.P., when we have seen

But I know short cut; be there in a jiffy. Come along.”
We come along. At end of twenty minutes find ourselves in front
of impassable gorge.

Another twenty minutes stumbling through aged heather. Path
trends downwards.
... That's all right,” says FINGEN, M.P.; “must lead on to the road.”
Instead of which we nearly fall into a bubbling burn. "Go back
again; make bee line up acclivity nearly as steep as side of house;
find ourselves again on top of mountain.

As if we had been trying all this time to get to top of mountain

Wants to wet his finger again and try how the wind lies. We
protest. Let us be saved that at least. FINGEN leads off in quite
another direction. By rocky pathway which threatens sprains;
through bushes and brambles that tear the clothes; by dangerous
leaps from rock to rock he brings us to apparently impenetrable
hedge. We stare forlorn.
“Hal” says FINGEN, M.P., more aggressively cheerful than
ever. "The road is on other side. Thought we would come upon it
somewhere.” Somehow or other we crawl through.
“Nothing like having an eye to the lay of country,” says
FINGEN, M.P., as we limp along the road. “It’s a sort of instinct,
you know. If I hadn't been with you, you might have had to camp
out all night on the mountain.”
They don't play goff at Deeside. They bicycle. Down the long
avenue with spreading elm trees deftly trained to make triumphal

arches, the bicycles come and go. ...WHIPSRoom, M.P., thinks oppor-
tunity convenient for acquiring the art of cycling., W. is got up
with consummate art. Has had his trousers cut short at knee in
order to º ribbed stockings of rainbow hue. Loose tweed-
jacket, blood-red necktie, white felt hat with rim turned down all
round, combine to lend him air of a Drury Lane bandit out of work.
Determined to learn to ride the bicycle, but spends most of the day
on his hands and knees, or on his back..., Looking down avenue at
any moment pretty sure to find W. either running into the iron
fence, coming off sideways, or bolting head first over the handles
of his byke. Get quite new views of him fore-shortened in all
possible ways, some that would be impossible to any but a man of his
determination.
“Never had a man stay in the house,” says FINGEN, M.P.,
ruefully, “who so cut up the lawn with his head, or indented the
gravel with his elbows and his knees.” - -
Evidently I was mistaken about goff. Cycling's the thing in
Scotland. -
Goasyoucan, Inverness-shire, $º." Not goff
nor cycling is the thing to do in Scotland. It's stalking. Soon learn
that º: truth at Goasyoucan. The hills that encircle the house
densely populated with stags. To-day three guns grassed nine, one
a royal. This the place to spend a happy day, crouching down
among the heather awaiting the fortuitous moment. Weather no
object, , Rain or snow out you go, submissive to guidance and instruc-
tion of keeper; by comparison with whose tyranny life of the ancient
galley-slave was perfect freedom.
Consummation of human delight this, to lie prone on your face
amid the wet heather, with the rain pattering down incessantly, or
the snow pitilessly falling, ºf you up flake by flake as if it
were a robin and you a babe in the wood. Mustn't stir; mustn't
speak; if you can conveniently dispense with the operation, better
not breathe. Sometimes, after morning and greater part of afternoon
thus cheerfully spent, you may get a shot; even a stag. Also
you may not; or, having attained the first, may miss the latter. At
any rate you have spent a day of exhilarating delight.
Stalking is evidently the thing to do in Scotland. It’s a far cry
to the Highlands. appily there is Arthur's Seat by Edinburgh
Town where beginners can practise, and old hands may feign delight
of early triumphs.

nothing to equal them in America.
So convenient to have a better class for those who can afford a
few, extra pence. Without this, we should have never seen that
duchess chatting away with the countess in her own right.
Yes; and so pleasant to be able to get five o'clock tea nicely served
by trim waitresses in a saloon upholstered with satins and ormolu,
And the duke and the viscount seem quite comfortable in the
luxuriously furnished smoke-room.
Well, the sight is not surprising considering that the designer
went to the Junior United Service Club for his model.
And yet the artisans are contented with their part of the vessel.
It certainly was a happy thought to supply their cabins with
bagatelle boards, dominoes, and a five guinea compendium of games.
n spite of the size of the vessels the boats travel at a rapid rate.
No doubt this is attributable to the *†: engines.
Of course. And really it is very pleasant to travel from Chelsea
to Kew to the sounds of a first-rate Hungarian Band.
The commissariat, too, has not been neglected. The luncheon on
board is worthy of the best traditions of the buffet at Calais. And as
cheap. Only fancy, half-a-crown for three courses and dessert!
Yes; and that meal seems equally Fº with the sixpenny tea
(with cakes and crumpets) prepared for the patrons of the fore-part.
The fares are also very low. Even in these hard times it would be
unreasonable to complain of overcharge when the ticket between the
Temple and Hampton Court is only fourpence.
It is marvellous that no one tried the plan before of starting bºats
from half the piers for all the rest at five minutes interval.
And yet they are crowded with travellers. Really the Thames
seems to be a very popular highway.
Naturally, when the passengers are sheltered from the weather—
too much sun or a plethora of rain—at all times.

lishing comfort with economy, and luxury with rapidi
Oh dear, no! If the metropolis had trusted to }. ilatory body,
it would have had to wait indeed!
Then to whom are the five million inhabitants of the chief city of
the universe indebted for these sweet boons?
To an ordinary man of business who knows how to cater for the
multitude, and has the Qourage to rely upon increased income as a
means of meeting additional outlay.—He merits a statue.—He de-
serves more-hearty praise by the Press when he discards his incognito.
ROBING-ROOM RUMOURS.
IN consequence of the great success of the “Smoking at Home” at
the Inner §. it is proposed to start a circus at the Middle.
The suggested “Musical Dinner” at Lincoln's Inn is now under
consideration, and will probably see the gas-light before the end of
the term.
The numerous professional engagements of Sir FR-NK L-cKw-p
will not prevent him from appearing as The “Lightning Cartoonist”
at the coming Gray's Inn atinée,
* *
Should the anticipated “Free-and-easy” come off at the Middle,
the LoRD CHANCELLOR. is not unlikely to give an exhibition of
swordsmanship. The distinguished Peer is said to be the finest
living exponent of the sword and dagger fight.
* *
The LoRD CHIEF JUSTICE is expected before Christmas to repeat
his recent interesting, address, with the assistance of a pianº and
dissolving views. A troupe of first-rate banjoists from the Three-
in-a-Bar Musical Society may possibly be found among the incidentals.
* *
There is no truth in the report that at the next “Five o'clock tea
with pipes” at Lincoln's Inn Sir 'ARRY 'AwRINs will warble
“ Down Newmarket Way.” +
* * -
In spite of the social entertainments in contemplation,the
Examiners of the Council of Legal Education will perform their
duties. At present, there is no intention of adding another subject
to the pass for admission to the Bar... In the future it may #.
that all students will have to take up “the duties and responsibilities
of proprietors of music halls.”

with “the reception” of the piece, and still more with “the

“Ex PEDE.”—Miss BAIRD appears as the model Trilby without
shoes or stockings. Such realism is a novelty which unfortunately
prevents this young actress from ever losing her identity, as, though

splendour is essential if we Guys are to main-
tain the dignity of our Order in these degene-

I hear whispers that one or two Guys who
go in for being “up to date” are seriously
thinking of exhibiting themselves this year on
bicycles, and, considering the sudden and enor-
mous popularity which the “bike” (to employ
\\ a hideous and vulgar abbreviation that offends

called “Upper Ten,” I am far from saying that
even such a public personage as a Guy must
necessarily suffer any loss of dignity by being
seen on a cycle—provided he insists upon being
securely tied on to the handle-bars, and also
seemed to me to imply an assumption of mili-
tary rank which, on the part of civilians like
ourselves, is surely rather a paltry affectation.
The only correct head-covering will be the
tall hat, which I hear will be bulgier than ever
this year. The smartest will have open crowns
and little or no brims. There has been some
attempt to revive the old straw hat, though

of this being adopted by Guys with any preten-

Masks this year are to be gayer—I might
even say gaudier—than ever. I noticed one of
bright magenta with large grape-green spots!
Sounds rather startling, you will think; but,
really, worn with a fustian jacket of a rather
sombre tone of chestnut, and a mock-astra-
khan toque, the effect was not half bad. The
latest idea seems to be to strike the dominant
colour-note in the mask, and make the rest of
the costume lead up to it. Personally, how-
ever, I prefer something which renders its
wearer less conspicuous. One in prawn-pink, zº

satisfactory answer to your

know the derivation of our

The French equivalent for the
saying is not, as some sup-

second person plural, impera-

to cease, which evidently is a
derivative of the Latin noun-

“cheese.”—Yours obediently,

In a sweet and unpolluted and unsmoky atmosphere.

...All delicately marching through the clear pellucid air.”

And the crowd, bereft of baccy, soon will almost cease to “seethe.”

That cigars and cigarettes and pipes innumerable raise.

In a third-class smoking carriage, with no stop for quite an hour,"
And no more from smarting eyes the tear we now shall have to wipe,
Excited by the navvy's small but parlous pungent pipe.
No more “Old Friend” or “Negrohead.” 'twill be our lot to sniff,
We shall walk abroad unfearful of the "penny morning whiff,”
Never more—oh, joy to think it!—shall be stricken from afar
By the penetrating odour of the “Saturday cigar”!
The Golden Age will then be here, no evil shall be rife. ..

HOW KIPPER SLEW THE NEW FOREST HORNET.
CHAPTER III.-The Restoration.
IT was a terrible position. The goblin and the hornet glared at
one another as fiercely as two ladies, who have got on the same
patterned frocks. It was one of those moments when you could no
more tell the hour by blowing thistle-down than, attempt to make
snowballs out of hoar frost. KIPPER was the first to recover his
resence of mind, “What do you want here?” he shouted to the
ornet with all the virtuous force which he could put into a voice
not naturally bass., “What do you want here?” he repeated, more
angrily; and, nearly cracking his organ of speech, he screamed, with
a superb air of command, “Be off, you rascal!, I say, be off l’
The giant hornet smiled in that sort of way which gives an honest
ladybird the creeps, as he growl
*What do i want?” That irº and
he pointed to the terrified EGLANTINE.
“I’ll teach her to interfere...in my
business. I’ve no quarrel with you,
KIPPER, so I strongly advise you to
mount your old horny-head’’ (here the
stag-beetle said a rude remark to him-
self), “get out of my way, and let me
dom .” “Never !” cried KIPPER,
drawing his fine sword-grass blade.
“Come on!” “O! KIPPER, dear KIPPER,
don’t risk your life for me,” sighed
EGLANTINE; “please don't.” “Keep
quit!”, muttered KIPPER, festily.
“Why do women always interfere in
these little matters?” Then to NIPPARD
he added, “Come on, Fº swaggerin
bully, you tormentor of every peacefu
inhabitant, you horrid tyrant, you—”
But here the hornet, stung by these
reproaches, tried to reply in similar but
more practical fashion. KIPPER, how-
eyer, was too quick for him, and gave
him a sharp prod in the right wing just
as he was swooping down on the crouch-
ing EGLANTINE. The stagbeetle clap
his horns together at the thrust, while
the toad waddled out of his hole and
took notes of the affray without com-
ment, for he had just as fine a sense of
the value of neutrality as Mr. GLADSToxE
or the PRESIDENT of the United States.
NIPPARD, however. was in nowise dis-
comfited and made another ferocious
dash, this time straight at KIPPER, who
fenced his sting, but got a buffet on the head from the hornet's
body which almost knocked him off his legs. However, he re-
covered himself and stood once more on guard. EqLANTINE mean-
while had pressed some more wild mint between her fingers and
anointed her champion's brow. This seemed to refresh him very
much. As to the ºft. he was too frightened to do anything.
So the fight continued, now KIPPER got a good stroke, now NIPPARD
wounded the goblin, but the hornet was never able to get full power
into his sting, nor the goblin into his sword, so nimble were both.
At last KIPPER, in parrying a most venomous onslaught, tripped
and fell backwards, and, ere EGLANTINE or the stagbeetle could come
to his assistance, his foe had pounced upon him. It was a fearful
sight as both struggled on the sward. At last KIPPER's blade was
thrust with a shout of triumph into the monster's body, and he stood
on it as it fell. But alas! scarcely had he done so, when he himself
rolled lifeless beside the corpse of his enemy. He had forgotten that
WN
“He recovered himself and stood once more on guard.”
hornets, like wasps and writers of reminiscences, can still sting, when
they no longer breathe. EGLANTINE and the stagbeetle vainly
endeavoured to revive the champion, who had won. He was as
insensible to their attentions as is an ironclad ship to the persistence
of an exploded torpedo. The stagbeetle, who was getting rather
*: from want of refreshment, and hated “scenes,” proposed that
he should go and fetch assistance while EGLANTINE might watch
the body. This she readily consented to do. Hardly had the beetle
droned himself out of sight when she flung herself upon the remains
of the hero and shed many bitter tears ere she could speak.
last she cried in her anguish “Oh * dearest, who was so good
#. . .gome back, come back, for I love you; yes! I love you
early.
Scarcely were the words out of her mouth when the little form of
KIPPER disappeared, and there arose in his place not a prince in
velvet doublet and silken hose, but a
well favoured man of about thirty,
dressed in a tweed suit, with billycoc
hat to match. EGLANTINE, though very
much surprised, was not the least bit
frightened, not even when the stranger
addressed her. “Sweetest EGLANTINE,”
he said, “know that I am not a goblin,
but a human being like yourself. I
was fortunate enough to discover a mine
of virgin gold in Western Australia, and
to have #. property assigned to me by
the government. Selfishly I kept the
secret to º and thereby incurred
the anger of the King of the Gnomes,
who, as a punishment for my sin against
the welfare of humanity, caused me to
be seized and transported here by the
Underground Antipodes Railway. In
this forest I was to abide in the repul-
sive form of KIPPER the Goblin, and to
make myself as disagreeable as possible
to everybody. I have done so, with
considerable success. Only one chance
\ of release was given to me, and that
was when some pure-hearted maiden
should declare her love for me. ... My
case seemed hopeless; but you, darling,
have broken the spell, and restored me to
my real self. My true name is ABCHI-
BAID Johnson. Will you be Mrs. J.?
EGLANTINE, having no fixed ideas, as
to “the proper, age of love,” unhesita-
tingly answered “Yes,”
So the inhabitants of the New Forest,
big and little, knew EGLANTINE no more,
and her mother retired to a house in Grosvenor, Square, where she
was waited on by a butler who looked like a . and by sixteen
tall footmen, whose discharges from the Life Gu she had bought
at considerable expense to her son-in-law. But he, was rich and
happy, and his beautiful wife's photographs were in all the stationers'
shop-windows. No trace of the great fight exists, except the body
of NIPPARD the Hornet, which the toad, with an eye to business,
stuffed, and exhibits on bank holidays and Coronation Day to all the
lower members of creation at four barleycorns a head; moles, earth-
worms, and tadpoles half-price. He devotes part of the proceeds to
the Home for B.º. Dormice, so it costs him nothing. As to the
stagbeetle, he joined a travelling circus, after being painted white
with black spots. He was accidentally killed, when doing the hoop-
trick, and may now be seen labelled a “Remarkable Specimen” in
the Natural History Museum at South Kensington.
The END.

Hôtel Métropole, Wednesday Night.—Dinner in Whitehall Rooms
to celebrate completion of railway communication between Natal and
South Africa. Occasion important; list of guests comprehensive;
all the Colonies represented, whilst DoN Josſ, home from historic
Spain, happily typified the paternal British Lion glad to see its
cubs around it. WALTER PEACE, Agent-General for Natal, is the
Amphitryon–le véritable Amphitryon oil l'on dine. As SARK says,
“With PEACE in the Chair and Plenty on the table, what more can
one desire?”

terpolating cigarette has not even colonial origin to recommend it.
“KICKY” likes it, 'tis true. But the British public scornfully asks,
“Who’s KICKY?” and will be no wiser if I tell them he’s a capitalist.
After dinner, speeches. For a man whose breast is blazoned with
Wictoria Cross, never saw anyone in such a funk as REDWERS BULLER
when he rose to reply to toast to the Army. Knees shook; manly
cheek blenched; evidently moment when he tºº. turning
his back on foe and bolting. But pluck of British soldier prevailed,
and he pulled through. If alternative were open to him, would
rather have gone through the Ashantee Campaign again, or worked
his way once more through the sad Soudan.
Nothing of this feeling apparent in demeanour of old friend
MARTIN F. TUPPER. General impression is that, like SHAKSPEARE,
he is dead. All a mistake; only changed his estate; dropped his earlier
initials; assumed name of CHARLEs, with a baronetcy, the G.C.M.G.,
the C.B., and the High Commissionership of Canada. Talks prose
now instead of poetry. But the old style indelible, ineradicable.
His speech to-night marked by all the prosy, kindly, commonplace
verbosity of the Proverbial Philosophy of his earlier state.
Don Josí, rising to respond to toast of his health, met with hearty
reception. Misguided man at end of room proposed to greet him as
“a jolly good fellow.” . Effort, well meant; had the songster
managed, at outset, to strike right note, the thing might have been
done. As it was inappropriateness of this particular hymnal, com-
bined with a certain flatness in the opening notes of the songster,
chilled the choir. As SARK says, “jollity not precisely the quality
one associates with JoE.” So the melody, after feebly fizzling round
the tables, was drowned in burst of laughter.
Occasion was, as Don Josſ remarked, first time he had publicly
appeared in “F. of Minister for the Colonies. In every way
a happy one. A gathering representing the uttermost corners of the
Empire, each vying with the other in loyalty to Crown. New Secre-

found echo in the crowded room, “that no separate existence, how-
ever splendid, could ºil. with that they enjoy equally with our-
selves as joint heirs of all the traditions of the past, joint partakers
of all the influence, resources, and power of the British Empire.”
A speech not too long, splendidly pitched, admirably phrased, full of
the old Palmerstonian ring, and yet, if closely examined, signifying
nothing likely to embarrass a Minister in future relations either
with Colonies or foreign powers. . Just the thing for the hour, and
the place. Full of promise for fresh triumphs for Don Josſ on the
new pathway he surprised some people by selecting as his own.

Threw quite a fresh light on the Spanish Armada. “Why,” he
exclaimed, “the Spanish Armada, with the assistance of Portugal
and Mexico, did not include as many ships as are under my manage-
ment in the Castle fleet !”
“Let us be grateful,” said SARK, as the man in the hat and cloak
department handed him through the pigeon-hole someone else's
overcoat, “that Don CURRIE was not born before his time or out of
his place. Had he been a subject of PHILIP THE SEcond, he would
certainly have commanded the Armada. . In which case the whole
course of history would have been changed, and to-day Great Britain
would have been even as Cuba.”

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
In this depressing weather it is always well to have something to
be thankful for. My own special subject for gratitude is the cessa;
tion and final end of the Marlborough-Wanderbilt wedding. All
these columns of matrimonial gush, which have been arriving by
mail and cable from America have been sufficient to make even a
good man curse his fellow-man, and retire to some othel planet.

not be allowed to blast a young man's career at its very outset.
Noh possibly are the WANDERbilts altogether in fault. They
possess many millions, and it is perhaps natural that they should
desire to celebrate the marriage ºf their daughter by spending some
of their dollars on diamonds, rubies, gold, silver, and exotic flowers.
But what is offensive. about the business is the morbid excitement
of the American public. The American public may declare that, it
was not excited; but, in that case, it is difficult to understand wh

MoREoy ER, this marriage was rehearsed., I don't think I am
putting the matter too strongly when I say that this constitutes an
outrage not only on good taste, but on proper religious feeling.
I imagine the happy pair bowing and kneeling with their bridesmaids
and attendants, and the weeping maiden aunts who are never absent
from such a ceremony, going solemnly through the intricate maze of
responses, while a mock clergyman reads a mock service and all the
spectators indulge in a mockery of emotion and congratulation. For
myself I would as soon re-marry a hearse, as rehearse a marriage.
THE whole business is, in fact, an illustration of that passion for
tawdry display and vulgar ostentation in which the great American

othing can be further from the fact. The error is probably due to
those splendidly inaccurate descriptions of "...# life with which
novel readers have been of late perplexed... From these it might be
º: that the undergraduate was in the habit of changing his
lothes some six times a day merely for purposes of display, and of
reserving his very smartest suit for the daily visit that he rays tº
the tº. gambling-hells which are, as we all know, to be found
by the score in the suburban districts of Oxford and Cambridge.
As a matter of fact, the average undergraduate is, in matters of
dress, the simplest of mankind. His great ideal is comfort, and as
old clothes are naturally more ocmfortable than new, it is quite a
common sight to see fº Blues, presidents of clubs, shining lights
of the river, the field, or the schools arrayed in Norfolk jackets, in
trousers on which at least two winters have laid their defacing hand,
and in shirts which, though of an immaculate cleanness, show
evident signs of wear and tear in the cuff department.
It must be remembered that the ordinary.ut dergraduate only
wears the clothes of civilisation for about half of every day. During
the rest of the time he is to be found in the garb most appropriate tº
his athletic pursuits. In the case of a rowing man, these extend
only to within six inches of his knees, and spectators have been heard
to wonder how such large and heavy frames can be supported on so
melancholy a deficiency of calves. I don't know how it is, but it is
a fact that if a rowing man stands more than seventy-two inches in
height, the girth of his calves will not exceed some ten inches.
IF in writing thus of undergraduate dress I have destroyed a
cherished illusion, I can only express my regret; but I have a strong
'feeling that the truth should be at last made to prevail, even against
the inexactitudes of university novelists.

THE MARVELLOUS FEAT OF TREE-ILBY SWENGALIVANISED I
“Trilby's tootsies! Trilby's feet!
There’s no mistake,
They take the cake,
Do Trilby's model feet!”
Chorus of Popular Nigger Song, adapted.
THE state of those who have read the novel before seeing the play,
is gracious; the state of those who have seen the play without having
Mr. Tree Stengalitanting. “You must learn to love me!”
previously read the novel, is the more gracious. Srengali,
- - - the weird,
inwashed Hebrew, the fantastical, musical magician, so dominates
the story, that the author of his being will be remembered as George
JEWMAURIER. And Srengali the Satanical, marvellously imperso-
nated by Mr. BEERBoHM TREE, stands out as the central figure of the
strange ungonventional drama at the Haymarket. It isn't Trilby,
the hypnotised subject, but Srengali, the fearful" object,” the dirty,
demoniac hypnotiser, on whom all eyes are fixed, and in whom the
interest is centred. He is Shylock and Fagin, Mephistopheleized.
he is as loathsome as Hyde without Jekyl; he is the Spirit of Evil in
the story of the Devil's Violin; he is the haunting ſeringing fiend in
the Shadowless Man; he is, in fact, the very Deuce himself.
“Q don't you remember sweet Alice, Ben Bolt,” is the “old song.”
which, at first, Miss Trilby Q'Ferrall." cannot sing,” but which,
when hypnotised by Satanical Svengali, she does sing; and, with
this, and with one or two other ancient ditties in her rather limited
fépertoire, she makes Svengali's fortune. The Diva is beaten and
kicked by the savage Svengali (not in the presence of the audience)
as if she were his slave, and he the brutal slave-driver. But,
why this treatment, if he has only to hypnotise her in order to
render her obedient to his slightest wish # It is, I suppose,
considered necessary he should do so, in order to excite our
compassion for his victim, the unfortunate Miss Trilby, and so to
bring down upon him the just chastisement which is the immediate
cause of his death. Otherwise, as Spengali has told her he loves
her, and as she (hypnotised of course) becomes his wife, why this
horrible ill-treatment? This seems to me to be the only weak
point in the plot of Mr. PAUL Potter's undeniably clever and most
effective play. But surely Svengali's diabolically jealous hatred of
"Little Billee,” his successful rival in the affections of Trilby
(when unhypnotised) would be sufficient motive for the brutal
insult he inflicts on Miss O'Ferrall's faithful, but insignificant,
wittle lover, and for which, at the hands of the strong man, Taffy,
the fiend-like Svengali has to pay with his life.
“PAUL Potter,” a name hitherto historically associated with the
celebrated “Bull,” not Papal but pictorial, now about two centuries
old, has hit the bull's-eye this time, and will realise a good round
sum from JoBN “of that ilk.” Thoroughly does PAUL deserve it
for his audacious ingenuity and his daring disregard of dramatic
conventionality. His third act, in which there is hardly any action
until the second entrance of Srengali, is so contrived that a few
persons narrating in dialogue what they are supposed to see hap-
pening off the stage, work up the excitement of the audience to
such a pitch that they instinctively cry “hush!” in order that
they too may join with the characters on the scene in º:
the voice of an invisible Trilby singing the hackneyed ditty “Ben
Bolt”.' This is a triumph due to the dramatist, to Messrs. LIONEL
BRough (The Laird), Mr. EDMUND MAURICE (Taffy), and Mr.
%; EwANs (Little Billee), with Miss FILIPPI as Madame
1720.7'a.
In this scene Mr. TREE's Spengali is no longer the squalid Fagin,
but is like the old pictures of PAGANINI, the famous violinist, decked
with the jewellery of the once celebrated “Mons. Julliºn.” Now
comes the exhibition of Svengal's venomous hatred for Little Billee,
in whose face he spits; a horrible and revolting thing to see done on
the stage, even though we know he is “only purtendin’.” For
this disgusting exhibition of temper, he is half strangled by the
Welsh giant Taffy.
Trilby, no longer under the hypnotic influence of Srengali, sings
horribly out of tune; the audience are º to rise in their
wrath and threaten to wreck the house (rather a strong order this,
but, as I have hinted, what no other dramatist dares PotrºR dares);
and then the miserable Srengali, after writhing and twisting in his
last agony, and “doing a back-fall” across a table with his head
downwards towards the foot-lights, his breath shaken out of his
body, his hair out of curl, his eyes staring horribly, dies, a terrible
topsy-turvy death never before seen on any stage. -
º the last Act poor ill-used Miss O'Ferrall also dies. The
dramatist has prevented this scene from being an anti-climax
wherein lay the danger, by preparing the audience with a wei
story told by Zouzou (Mr. HERBERT Ross) of his having seen the
ghost of Svengali, who, soon afterwards, appears as a portrait of
himself—not “a speaking likeness,” as he does not utter a syllable,
—donein “luminous paint,” within a picture-frame which has been
forwarded as a nice little wedding present to
Miss O'Ferrall on the eve of her marriage -- º

(By “Hansom Jack.”)
No. XI. — CABBY'S NOTES ON NOWEMBER—FOG ON THE
FIFTH_A PYROTECHNIC FARE-ASTRAY IN THE
SUBURBS-FIREWORKS IN FOGLAND,
“REMEMBER, remember, the fifth o' November”? You bet if there's
any one does, ’tis a Cabby.
Novº: the month when all London's smudged out, and the
Cockneyist driver runs wild as a babby. -
Eugh! I could tell you some chump-chilling tales about life on the
box in a London peasouper -
Which 'im who would stand, after twenty or so, must be 'ard as tin-
tacks, and as tough as a trooper.
“Jimminy-whiz 1" as YANK MushgrubbHR puts it, our sububs in
frost, with a fog, is tremenjous.
And arter a few 'ours cold crawl up to 'Ampstead, we long for a
something to mend us or hend us,
We don't care much, which, till the rum 'ot 'as warmed us. Ah!
life is a matter of cumfable feeling, ..
And if it's wuth living or not is a question of temperytoor; that
there ain't no concealing.
Wy, a chap warm, and one chilled to the marrer, is no more alike
than hegg-flip and a hicicle. -
Lose me about Peckham Rye in a fog, and I'd kick a stray dog, or
knock over a bicycle.
Darkness as lets you drive into a lamp-post, and makes your shirt
feel just like moist paper-mashy,
Would make a harkangel a porkypine; speshul if you've a lamp
broke, and the branches are splashy.
You just take a saint or a syrup, and git 'im to drive a cross fare, in
a fo $ºp to Streatham, [and if 'e don't let 'em
And find 'isself lost, running into a churchyard or up a blind halley,
Fly frequent and free, words beginning in d, and a few more loud
letters, as bring conserlation
In trials and tantrums to cabbies and gents, you can make 'im arch-
bishop without consecration |
I’m nuts upon fº. old November—sometimes—though, when fog
isn't on, and there ain't too much drizzle,
A spin through the sububs about ten o'clock, on the fifth, when the
... place seems aflare and a fizzle
With bonfires and fireworks, and up through the tree-tops the rockets
go whizzing and busting like winking;
Wy, somehow it makes me feel just like a boy again; not a bad
feeling, at least to my thinking.
Some years agone, on a damp, misty Guy-night, a jolly-faced gent,
with one eye, and a bundle
As looked like a parcel o' props, came towards me a-trottin' as brisk
as 'is short legs could trundle; -
“Take me to Tooting P” 'e garsº, “At a price, Sir,” I arnsers’im
sharp. "Right ” sez 'e; “put a name to it !”
“Fog's thickenin' up, Sir,” I sex. “If you’re game to say—so-much
—I’m on.” And the old gent was game to it.
Fust, we'd a liquor, and then 'e sez “Fireworks!”.. a-bossing
'is bundle * one heye a-glitter. [I sez with a titter,
: Don't blow us up, Sir. I ain't got no licence to carry hexplosives,”
“Young’uns a-waiting at Tooting,” 'e sex; “so drive sharp, and I
won't be too tight on the pocket; -
I do like a good firework frolic, with boys, though I blew this heye
out—as a boy—with a rocket.”
“Plucky old cock, and most pleasant l” thinks I, tooling off at full
trot with old BRock. “Here’s a barney !”
But I was a mossel too previous this time, as I jolly well found
when arf way through my journey.
Just this side o' Balham the fog grew—well black!
other word for it. Black as Thames banks are,
And thick as their mud. If you arsk where we got, you carn’t know
what a London Pertikler's queer pranks are.
We got everywhere save to Tooting, I fancy. Slap on to a common,
ang into a river,
Or something dashed like it; I stuck to the box till my fingers were
ice and my spine all a-shiver;
Then took out my lamp, and led Molly a mile or so. 'Twasn't no
good. We pulled up in a medder, -
Aside of a ditch wich I bloomin' near plºd in. “EHillo!” sez
old BRock. “That was nearly a header!”
Tarblow Vivong " Not so very much vivong, though, seeing the lot
was 'arf dead with the chatters.
“Well,” sez old One-heye, “where are we, I wonder P Two guys–
without bonfires / As mad as two 'atters
To try it so fur. 'Ave a nip ! ...Ah! that’s better.
Neat brandy, like love and like ire, works
In warming one up. If we could draw attention. By Jovel 'Appy
thought ! ! e will let off some fireworks / / /?”
So said, and so done! Talk of pantermines I Scott!
hus two shivering, wropt-up, grey ghostes.
Like two steaming bundles, a fumbling around, fixing rockets and
catherine-wheels to damp postes,
And striking of splutt'ring fusees, you'd 'a' thought we was demons
a doin' of Guy Fox's duties.
At last— whizz / Away went a couple of rockets a-rending the fog,
reg'lar red-and-green beauties.
Don't talk of Der Fryshoots! . We looked like a party of spooks
celebrating the fifth in old bogland;
Wy even poor Molly Fº up 'er froze ears at this “Whistler-like
s in É.
There ain't no
Don't grizzle!
If you'd seen
icter of Firewor nd.”
As old One-heye called it, wotever 'e meant. But it 'ad its effect
though, for torches come flaring
And voices come 'owling across the damp flats, to inquire wot it was
that still neighbourhood scaring.
“Wy Huncle! !!” a sharp little ni voice squeaks as the party
drew nigh. Cries old BRock, “Wot, young TEDDY l’”
We wasn't a bºw-shot away from the 'ouse where old One-heye was

SCENE–"My dame's" house
in Keat's Lane; wall-eved,

TIME–Winter : immediately

(A New Song to an Old Setting.)
[Mr. CHAMBERLAIN has apparently satisfied himself that Imperial Fede-
ration is not a mere dream, as many among us and in the Colonies still regard
it. Such dreams, he remarked, have a way of being realised. “It is a
dream that appeals to the highest sentiments of patriotism, and even of our
material interests. It is a dream calculated to stimulate and improve every
one who cares for the future of the Anglo-Saxon race.”—Leeds Mercury.]
AIR-" Let me Dream Again.” New Colonial Minister carolleth : —
QUB sun's not setting, as fools said of late,
Nor shall it, whilst I stand at England's gate 1
The cheers are ringing at the words I say,
As I point the Kingdom to the Federal way.
I say it appeals to our patriot sentiment,
And the Colonies are gathering round in calm content:
Is this a dream P. Then waking would be pain.
Oh, do not wake mel Let me dream again
The thought is º one to make man tower,
Of the Federation of Old England's power.
Our children grow up as time onward glides,
But though youth may pass away, home-love abides.
The Little-Englanders were wrong, somehow.
They said we must part; ah!, but dare they say so now?
Is this a dream Then waking would be pain.
Oh, do not wake me! Let me dream again

Ghoss INGRATITUDE Towards Two Old Public Favourites.—At
Portsmouth municipal elections Messrs. Cox and Box were at the
bottom of the poll in their respective wards.
THE IMPERIAL FEDERALIST'S WADE MECUM.
Question. Is not the idea of the Federation of the British Empire
merely a dream? -
Answer. Scarcely, since the matter has attracted the attention of
Mr. CHAMBERLAN, who is hardly a visionary.
Q. Has public opinion anent the question seen any change of late?
A. Distinctly. The idea is at this moment . ular. Ten years
ago, what may now be called a dream was regarded as a nightmare.
Q. What is the chief difficulty in the way of Imperial Federation?
A. The varieties of race. A Canadian is scarcely an Australian,
3. there is little in common between a Hindoo and a native of the
ape. -
Q. But cannot much be done in the direction cf merging the
cosmºpolitan elements of the British Empire into one huge family
by establishing under the shadow of the Union Jack the penny post P
A. Such is the opinion of Mr. HENNIKER-HEATON, M.P.
Q. And could not free trade for the colonies, as distinguished from
protection applied to foreign countries, be successfully employed?
A. Such is the opinion of several Members of the Government.
Q. Has any other plan occurred to the patriotic statesman? ..
A. Yes; it has been believed that a general tax for the National
Defence would be a bond of union between the colonies and the
mother country. - -
Q. Does there not already exist a stronger tie than taxatiºn?.
A. Certainly. The Empire has a common friend, adviser,
amuser, and instructor, beloved of all the world.
Q. Does, then, the profound respect felt for this popular personage
keep the Empire in accord?
A. Urquestionably. The popular personage represents not only
Britons at home, but Britons beyond the sea.
Q. And where is this popular personage found? .
#: In every part of the colonies, in India, in China, in fact, evory-
wnere.
Q. But has not this popular personage headquarters in London P
A. He has, at 85, Fleet Street.

[Novrum 16, 1895.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
MR. PUNCH is obviously not the most fitting
person to review his own hiº It has been
enough for him during the last fifty-four
years to make it. But a word must be said in
these columns of The History of Punch, just
issued in a handsome volume by Messrs.
CASSELL. Through four years Mr. SPIELMANN
has been engaged upon what he indicates on
every page has proved a labour of love. There
was danger that enthusiastic admiration for
the subject might induce in the author a
fulsome tone that would have been fatal to
the historical and literary value of the book.
Mr. SPIELMANN happily avoids that pitfall.
Heis, upon occasion, sternly and, my Baronite
adds, justly critical. But it is the personal
traits in his story that will most attract. In
his pages there live once more for the world,
seen in the borrowed but skilfully managed
lightof intimate personal acquaintance, figures
whose memories are ever enshrined in the
hearts of those who still from week to week
ather round the old “Mahogany Tree.”
ARK LEMON, SHIRLEY BRooks, ToMTAYLOR,
LEECH, KEENE, Douglas JERROLD, The PRO-
Frsson,Tom Hood, THACKERAY, DICKY DOYLE,
WILLIAM BRADBURY, G. A. ABECKETT and, a
generation later, his gifted son GIL-all, all
are gone, the once familiar faces. They are
met with again in Mr. SPIELMANN's book, the
pen and pencil sketches illustrated by admir-
ably reproduced contemporary portraits. The
inner history of Punch is a subject that has
ever had a fascination for the British public.
Attempts, more or less futile, to gratify the
desired acquaintance have been made at various
times through the last thirty years, Mr.
SPIELMANN has not only brought singular
aptitude to the task assigned to himself, but
has had the advantage of the cordial assist-
ance of divers men having personal know-
ledge of events they record and personages
of whom they speak. Mr. Punch desires to
add his testimony to the general approval the
History has received by the voice of the
Press. The work, full of difficulty and not
without delicacy, is thoroughly well done.
Looking at himself in the mirror held up by
Mr. SPIELMANN, Mr. Punch finds no flaw in
the glass.
My Baronite would not advise those about
to travel to take passage by any ship, whither-
soever bound, of the start whereof CLARK
RUSSELL knows ...; His cruisers mostly
set out in fine weather, with swelling breeze, in
the full sunshine of circumstance. Then
comes a hitch, and there follow the most
blood-curdling adventures that ever happened
since men first began to go down to do busi-
ness in the great waters. The marvel of it is
that Mr. RUSSELL's imagination never flags,
nor is he ever at loss for those minute details
which, skilfully and artistically piled up, go
to make a living picture. Heart of Oak, his
last work, just Fº by CHATTo AND
WINDUs, is worthy, to take its place in the
matchless roll of his sea stories. Of *:
writers Mr. RUSSELL, alike in style an
method, most nearly approaches the classic
standard of DEFoE. n his last work he has
captured the stormy seas south of Cape
Horn, brings home their turmoil, their snow
squalls, their icebergs, and a general sense of
their desolation to the gentleman of England
who sits at home at ease. That historic
person's opportunity of making acquaintance
with those interesting parts is decidedly more
agreeable and, under Mr. CLARK RUSSELL's
guidance, is scarcely less informing than a
voyage in the Lady Emma, a vessel of six
hundred tons, which was the sad fate of the
principal characters in this thrilling story.
The Baron feels it incumbent upon him to
correct a statement in Mr. T. H. S. Escott's
“WHAT I AN Actress witHout Shoes or
STCCKINGs | I NEveR HEARD of such A
THING ! I should LIKE TO KNow what
PEOPLE would sav IF I were To Go FLAUNT-
ING ABOUT ON TBE STAGE witH BARE FEET | "
most readable and interesting work, entitled
Platform, Press, Politics, and Play, which,
if allowed to go uncontradicted, would thereby
allow a great error to creen into University
and Dramatic History. Mr. Escott says
that the late Mr. AIFRED THOMPson “had,
together with several others, been one of the
A. D. C.’s founders at Cambridge.” This is
not so; Mr. ALFRED THOMPson had taken his
degree, and “gone down,” some four years
before the A. D. C., was founded; vide preface
to Personal Reminiscences of the A. D. C.,
first paragraph, and also p. xi. of the same.
Mr. Escott is a most entertaining companion,
as is also Mr. HENRY RUSSELL, whose pro-
fession was for years “entertaining,” and
who wrote such songs as the world will not
willingly letdie. Woodman Sparethat Tree”
is one of them. The RussELL Reminiscences
(published by MAcquEEN, in one volume,
entitled “ Cheer, , Boys, Cheer / ") the
Baron must take leave to , correct, on one
point. , HENRY RussEIL alludes to “that dis-
tinguished Punch trio, Doug LAs JERRoLD,
MARK LEMON, and GEORGE CRUIkshANk.”
The last mentioned was never “on Punch.”
He was a great friend of MARK LEMON's, but
never drew for Mr. Punch.

PREss-GANG, To THE REAR l–A delicious;
“exchange of views” took place at the elec-
tion of Dungarvan Commissioners. Mr.
RYAN is a gentleman who deprecates pub-
licity. He observed:—
My heart is full of gratitude to you, and we will
work hand in hand. Scribblers must take a back
seat. (Laughter.) No “terrible scenes” will
take place here... I saw Dungarvan placarded in
London, “terrible scenes at Dungarvan,” and all
the disgrace is brought on the town by one man,
who, for a few shillings—and if it cost me my
life I will put it down. Woe to the man who will
continue to do it here. I saw him a pot-boy at
the Monks' school, and I say— i
Mr. O'Shea. If you refer to me, Mr. RYAN, the
people of Dungarwan know me better and respect
me better than they do you. I am better off than
you... You have only a few shillings a week for
minding the shop.
Mr. Ryan. You are lying, Sir.
The Board broke up in disorder.
“OUR ‘scenes' to publish far and wide
Denotes a lack of local pride;
These scribblers I can not abide”-
Said RYAN of Dungarvan.
“Discord I hate—so I declare -
My friend and colleague on that chair
Once did the alehouse tankards bear”-
Sneered RYAN of Dungarvan.
“Mild language, too, I greatly prize;
If any one this fact denies
I must remark he foully lies”—
Roared RYAN of Dungarvan.
O MoREs!—Farewell to the adjective gallant
as a prefix to “little Wales,” for no longer
can it justly be used in such conjunction!
The British Lady Football Club gave an ex-
hibition game in Cardiff, and the inhabitants
says the South Wales Daily News, gathe
in their thousands to witness the display,
in which they were intensely interested. T But
—horribile dictu—whenever a fair footeress
“came a ºppº, the crowd, of course, shouted
with glee "/ Of course / When a recreant
male sustains a fall, what expressions of
tender solicitude burst from the sympathetic
lady-spectator's lips | And this her reward!
If any of our Gallic neighbours had been
present at the match to hear those rude,
deritive “shouts of glee,” their comment,
most probably, would have been—
“Gallois—mais pas galant!”
INJURED INNOCENCE. — A Bristol paper
lately suggested that possibly some local
butcher might have bought some of the
thousands of sheep brought from Montreal
in the Memphis steamship. The very idea
of such a thing has scandalised the local
trade, and a butcher wrote to repel the vile
aspersion. The paper says:–
It is refreshing to hear from this subscriber in
the trade that, after trying it once some years ago,
he has never had a bit of foreign meat in his shop
since. We are afraid we must not give his name,
* he is one of the best known butchers in
ristol.
This is excellent. Why should not local
bodies everywhere give prizes to butchers
who sell no foreign meat P. It would be pro-
tection, somebody objects? Yes, it would be
rank protection to the meat-consumer, and
as such it is never likely to be adopted.
MANSION House MEM.–If the late Lord
Mayor's example of entertaining as shown

The Three Impostors, a novel (“Key-note” Series) by ARTHUR

being a bit stiff; but, though it has the machens of a good story in
it, there is very little worth reading after page 64.

The twenty-first edition of Hadyn's Dictionary of Dates. issued
by WARD, Lock, AND Bowden (why not WARD, £4% AND KEY P),
modestly announces that it “contains the History of the World to
the Autumn of 1895.” That is a bold claim, but an hour or less
spent in turning over its pages shivers scepticism. Within its
compass, and at its price, it is not too much to say that it is
one of the most marvellous and most valuable volumes issued from
the press. If any modest householder wants to form a library, and
has neither the means, the time, nor the shelves wherewith to
accumulate a miscellaneous collection of the ordinary kind, let him
save up sixteen shillings to buy Hadyn's Dictionary of Dates, and
there he is; or, to be more precise, there's his library. By a coinci-
dence, full of happy omen for the Dictionary, it first saw the light in
1841, the natal year of Mr. Punch. It began a sturdy, bulky
babe of 568 pages, smaller in size and larger in type than, later
editions. It has grown into a volume of 1216 pages, closely printed,
each one crowded with miscellaneous information reaching to the
ends of the earth. “If,” my Baronite says, “there's anything you
want to know, and you can't find all about it in Hadyn's Dictionary
of Dates, you can console yourself with the conviction that it's not
worth knowing.”

THE SKITTISH SKIRT-DANCERS.
A TIP-Top Novel.
[N.B. All my novels are.—GR-NT ALL-N.]
INTRODUCTION.
(Once read, abused ever afterwards.)
...This is a Tip-Top Novel. I sell it to all who have gold enough,
silver enough, or copper enough to pay for it.
What do I mean by a Tip-Top Novel? Well, of late there has
been a great flow of stories which have struck a false key-note. A
Tip-Top Novel is one written by myself.
itherto, owing to the stern necessity laid upon the modern seer
for earning his daily bread, and incidentally of getting a publisher
to assist him in promulgating his prophetic opinions (i.e., the opinions
out of which he makes a profit—my own Woman who Did is in its
18th edition, and I net price a good deal of the proceeds), the reall
great works of fiction have never been written. I, myself, have h
to eke out a precarious livelihood from short stories and scrappy
science whilst my inward thoughts were tearing me to masterpieces.
But it’s a JoHN LANE that has no turning, and at length I have
found him, or (to be accurate) it was the Woman who Did. In the
future, just to mark the distinction between the books which are
mine and those which other ple write to satisfy mere editors of
periodicals, I propose to add the words “A Tip-Top Noyel” to every
one of my stories. When you see the magic words “A. Tip-Top
Novel,” just stip-stop and buy it. I am a Democrat of the first
(Grant) Allen Water, but I live on royalties.
Not, of course, that all my previous works—stories, verses, gossips,
science causeries, idylls, and what not—have not been all Tip-Tºp.
I divide with GeoRGE WASHINGTON the distinction of never having
been untrue to myself. But I have often had to suppress my
thoughts, and treat them as mere guarantees of good faith, not
necessarily intended for publication. In fact (as I have said else-
where) I have served babes, a mere milkman. the glorious future,
a minister to men, I am to blaze with all the brilliancy of a full-
}. butcher. In the Tip-Top Novels (published at tip-top prices)

time.
Whenever in future, my friend, and (I hope) patron, the words
“A Tip-Top Novel” appear upon the title page of a book by me, the
reader who is keen on culture may bet his boots (1) that the scene
(and the characters) will lie in Surrey, and (2) that the book repre-
sents my own high thinking on some great problem, with sex as its
unknown quantity.
Not that I shall ever attempt to prove anything, except to prove
ºful Otherwise my books, like my spirits, will be well above
proor.
º again, Why a Tip-Top Novel? Well, here's one last purple
patch.
I am writing this in my study, on the back of a gold-mine pro-
spectus. As I thoughtlessly turn it over, thinking to write on both
sides of the question, my eye falls upon ions and millions of un-
raised capital. More is going to be spent on one gold-mine than has
been given for all my novels put togetherl My window, however,
looks out upon unsullied nature. Through the open casement I hear
popular airs being sung by happy villagers, t g the pine
needles. Clodhoppers chirp from the tense tangle of boundless
bracken. And yet where at night the sky shows itself well read, the
great oven of London incloses a Lord Mayor and a Kaffir Circus.
This is a gold-mine age. The men of the suburbs, alas! are
crowding to the City to kiss the Barney stone. Strange, cent.-per-
cent. things and abnormal dividends attract them... I desire in these
books of mine to utter one last word in favour of the Higher System
as applied to life. Have I no doubts at all myself? Ay, marry,
I have—for to marry, have I not said it is doubtful? Yet, as I take
my eye from off the prospectus, my gaze transfers itself to the bric-
... outside, and then to a little shelf where lies the greatest
work of our greatest philosopher. It is (I need hardly say) the
Woman who Did. What comfort and counsel has its author P. Buy
the book and read it for yourself. - -
I, myself, read the words “eighteenth edition” on the title-page,
and the words comfort me. This will show you what my ideas are.
They may pay or they may not. But at any rate they are the
genuine attempts of a far-seeing man to turn Key- into Bºº.

LAST WEEK I
MR. BRIEFLESS ON LEGAL EDUCATION.
SIR,--To my great surprise, I find that many members of the
rofession to which I have the honour to belong have been forward-
ing, letters to a contemporary on, the subject of the Lord Chief
Justice's address concerning Legal Education. This seems to me. Sir,
a singular mistake... I grant that your contemporary is a paper of the
highest respectability, and deserving. of infinite respect; but, Sir,
the periodical you edit with so much distinction, has been considered
for more than half a century the recognised organ of the Bench, the
Bar, and the remainder of the Forensic Profession. And as this is
so, I address my remarks on the subject to which I have referred,
and which is a subject of great importance, to you personally.
Lord RUSSELL of KILLow EN seems to consider that the theories of
the Law should be learned before call, and “the practical study” be
stponed until “those earlier years of professional life, when pro- be
essional work is insufficient for full occupation.” Speaking from
my own experience, I must confess that the time allowed by the
Lord Chief Justice is ample in excess... I can honestly declare,
without fear of contradiction, that never, during a X; long forensic
career, have Ifound “professional work sufficient for full occupation.”
It is true that during term I make it my custom of a forenoon to be
present at one or other of the Royal Courts, in order that I may
exchange greetings with the presiding judge. . But after I have
accorded this appropriate act of courtesy to his Lordship on the
Bench, I find the time hang heavily on my hands. Of course, if I
hold a consent brief, I am on the qui vive until my case is reached,
mentioned, and disposed of. But should the day be blank when
I have no need to call upon the fifth part of the services of m
excellent clerk, PokTINGTON (services I share with my learn
friends in Chambers), I have to fall back upon the perusal of
the daily journals or the concoction of caricatures. It is at
such a moment that I feel the need of occupation, and perhaps I
might venture to suggest that my time might be usefully employed
in the teaching of freehand drawing. Would it not be possible to
organise a school of “Barrister black-and-white men?” The Lord
Chief Justice favours the academical idea, and here would be a com-
mencement. I would propose. that my scholars, properly, robed,
should take their places, supplied with paper and pencil, and study

from the life., They might rapidly sketch the witnesses, the
counsel, even the judge himself. During the luncheon interval I
would come round to inspect the drawings. I could point out the
defects of beginners, and º any evidence of talent that I might
discover in the maturer work of more experienced scholars. At the
end of term a distinguised Q.C., who has had the honour of acting as
a Law Officer of the Crown, *:::: act as “Examiner of Caricatures.
I would present prizes to those who passed first—a wig. (well
seasoned) in travelling case, a gown (nearly new), a dozen bands
a fee book (first sheet missing), and other Pºi. rewards of
merit. I submit that the idea is worthy of adoption, and when
carried out, will run on all-fours with Lord RUSSELL of KILLOWEN's
excellent system of legal education. -
For the rest, the suggestion that the teachers of Law in the Law
School should devote their entire time to the duties of tuition
merits the most careful consideration. Speaking personally, I would
very, willing to sacrifice, my present practice to , accept the
Principalship of the proposed Academy. It is true that this would
be a little hard upon my existing clients; but I feel sure that, when
they realised what good I might do to the profession by showing the
budding barrister and the juvenile solicitor how to obtain, without
loss of dignity, a living, they would readily forgive the desertion
and forget the injury. And, having said this, I write my name and
address, for the information of Lord Russell, of KILLowen, and
those who will hereafter be associated with his Lordship in carrying
his Lordship's views of reform into expeditous execution.

Railway for aE. penny against most superbly slow railway going

Was it yesterday, day before, or last week that SARK and I left
Oban full of hope and baggage, bound for hospitable mansion near
Carlisle? Or was it before railways were, and did we start in stage

been this year at all. Only thing certain is that arrangements as per
time-table were excellent. Leave Oban 12.35; so may .#

bracken clothing the hills that stretch away eastward to Loch Awe.
Remember, years ago, walking along this road with breezy Professor
BLACKIE, towards the house on the hill which he built for himself,
whence he could see the sun setting over the mountains of Mull.
No railway station in those days. When you left Oban homeward
bound you went by stage coach land 5, or by one of the fine lines
of steamers DAVID HUTCHESON created, supplementing work of
WALTER Scott in opening up the wonderful beauty of the High-
lands. To the last fine, old DAVID HUTCHEson, used to sit by the
window in his room looking down the bay, watching, his steamers
come and go. Now John BLACKIE has folded his plaid around him
for last time and is quiet for evermore. DAVID HUTCHEson's keen,
kindly face no longer looks out from his window. A granite obelisk
set on, high at the entrance to Oban Bay has his name cut deep upon
it, and his memory is kept green by the ripple of the sea at the fore-
foot of the fleet that carry the flag of his

Here’s railway station and we in good time for 12.35 train.
Excellent. Station time-bills confirm BRADSHAw's statement.

over cup of tea; on to Carlisle, due at 8.35. With five mile drive
shall be a little late for dinner, but that no matter.
“We’ll call it supper,” said SARK, a man full of resources.
Plenty of room in carriage. Tide of traffic ebbed. We are going
off almost on last wave.
“Another slice of good luck,” says SARK, rubbing his hands with
pleased content. “In height of season, with crowds of tourists,

with English mail at Stirling even when, as now, we start with
half-an-hour to spare. But with carriages nearly empty, baggage
vans only a quarter filled, we are safe as houses.”
Only onefellow-passenger. Not at all a cheerful party; cadaverous
cheeks; restless eyes with curious look in them, as if he were
straining to catch last glimpse of some prized object vanishing in
distance. Twitching gesture with bony, nervous hands. At brief
intervals, as we journey east, hoping to make south at Killin
Junction, he jerked up his right hand as if to stop something, and
there came into his eyes the look of pained entreaty. Rather an
uncanny person;...hoped he wasn't ſº far. Manoeuvred SARK
into sitting opposite him; fixed myself up at other corner seat.
Rather surprised to find train didn't start at 12,35. Didn't indeed
move till 12.50.
“In no hurry,” I remarked.

shouting at the top of his voice, and elbowing peaceable citizens off

abrupt termination by a constable. But the “public guardian” was
considerably astonished to find that his prisoner was neither
“charioted by Bacchus and his pards,” nor even “on the viewless
wings of Poesy,” but perfectly sober, and only pretending to be
drunk. The reason for his feigned inebriety was not explained:
Perhaps, in a like predicament with “DAVID GARRICK,” and mindful
of the famous simulated—intoxication scene in the play of that name,
he hoped, in the same manner, to “disillusion” some fair—or too
importunate—inamorata. However, his excellent acting on this,
“his first appearance,” received due magisterial º in the

his undoubted histrionic ability will stand him in good stead, and

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
A RETRIRVER's DIARY.
DURING the past week I have been shooting pheasants in Norfolk.
We had good sport, and fairly good weather, and I was able for the
first time to test an ingenious mechanical contrivance of which we
may expect to hear a great deal in the future. It is called (I quote
from the advertisement which is now in my possession) the “Canine
Cogitatograph,” a title which, I admit, is detestably mixed in its
derivations. The inventor, however, who desires for the present to
keep his name secret, may plead in extenuation the example of that
great philosopher HERBERT SPENCER and his series on “Sociology.”
THE object of this invention is to record automatically the thoughts
passing through the mind of a dog. By a clever adaptation of the
MoRSE system of telegraphy these are printed off in English on strips
or tapes of paper... I am not sufficiently skilled in mechanics to
describe the invention technically; suffice it to say that it is very
small and convenient in size, and can be easily fitted on to any
ordinary dog's collar.
DURING my late pheasant-shooting excursion I attached it to the
collar of my retriever, with the most astonishing results. For the
benefit of the scientific, and sporting public I now publish this
singular autobiographical fragment from the diary of a sporting dog.
Mowda P, November 11, 10 A.M.-Am unchained. Large party
with guns. Sport. Hurrah! Smell out master, dance round him
and place, both fore-paws on his knickerbockers. Am reproved.
Why?. There are two more black dogs, strangers to me, and a brown
spaniel whom I have met before... The spaniel is a fool. His ears
are ridiculously long, and flap in the most absurd manner. His nose
is broad, his eyes bulge, and his legs are bandy. A dog like this is
only fit for hedgerows. Exchange tip-toe courtesies with the two
black strangers. Growl at them. They growl back. We are all
reproved. hy?
10.20. Corner of a cryert. Heard keeper say “There was a
hundred pheasants drawed into that 'ere covert.” This is ripping.
Master applies whip twice, but not very hard. Tells me he does
come out my way. I kill two with a right and left and miss
another with my second gun. Sun must have got into my eyes;
Shall I go after dead birds now or wait? Better wait. Got thrashed
last time for running after birds before beat was over. Guns going
off to the right and left. Brown dog, so far, has killed nothing.
One of the black dogs named Sailor has killed four. Ridiculously
conceited dog that. Eight more pheasants come to me, one by one.
Kill five. Miss three. Brown dog smiles audibly, Shall cut the
brown $35, or bite him in the back. Shout from beaters. “Hare
forward.” I’ll have his fur, or die in the attempt. Comes gallop-
ing out on my right. I miss him twice. I'll show him who can
f op. Off after him. Distant shouts from Master. Who cares?
nto a ditch. Out again, Across ploughed field. Hare still infront.
Am gaining. , No, am losing. Hare is a silly animal; shall giye
it up, and go back. By the bye, got thrashed last time for doing this.
Wonder if I shall thrashed again. Better assume contrite
expression. DJ so. . . . No good. Am thrashed. Howl. Never
was a Spartan dog. Beat over. Pick up dead birds. Mouth full of
feathers. Am sent to look for a bird wounded by brown dog, who
has shot disgracefully, and made a perfect fool of himself. Track
bird to ditch. Faint scent to right. Follow up fifty yards, then
through hedge ; back again. Got him, Return covered with
burrs, with bird in mouth. Am patted. Brown dog, who has been
thrashed, hints that he doesn't think much of the performance.
Offers to carry bird for me, “if I am tired.” Should like to see him
dare to touch it.
THE above may serve as a sample of the whole. I always suspecºed
that a dog believed that he himself, and not his master, killed the
birds. Now I know it, on the unimpeachable testimony of the
“Canine Cogitatograph.” I shall be happy to send further par-
ticulars of this admirable contrivance to any sportsman who may
apply to me.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ART 18 MEASUREMENT.
REUTER's telegram says that
the chrysanthemum blossoms,
used at the marriage of the Duke
of MARLBoRough, if piled up,
would equal in bulk an ordinary
haystack, and the roses, if placed
from end to end, would extend
over a distance of eight miles.
Here is at last an exact system
for calculating the merits of
decorative art. Mr. Punch has
therefore instructed his Chief
Statistician in Ordinary to furnish
a report on some disputed mat-
ters, now for ever decided by the
following calculations.
The statues in London, if
melted, pounded up, and other-
wise reduced to a single mass,
would equal in bulk an ordinary
cottage. The Elgin marbles,
treated in the same way, would
#". in bulk an ordinary cartload
rubbish, and the Venus of
Milo would be half the bulk of an
ordinary piece of rock. There-
fore, &c. Q. E. D.
The pictures in the Salon Carré
of the Louvre, added to those in
the Tribuna at Florence, would
only cover one-fifth of the space
occupied by those in an ordinary
—a very ordinary—exhibition of
the Royal Academy of Arts. All
the pictures of WELAsquez, cut
into narrow strips, would actually
not extend from Piccadilly Cir-
cus to Kensington Church, and
those of REMBRANDT, if the can-
vases were rolled up, could be
packed into an ordinary four-
wheel cab. Therefore, &c.
. E. D.
The total mass of teapots manu-
factured in Birmingham, from the
earliest times to the present day,
“OH YEs, I Do I
“A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.”
“I BET You Don't KNow why AN APPLE FALLs To THE GROUND !”
WHEN IT's Got A WoRM INSIDE |"
would probably equal St. Paul's
in bulk. It is, however, difficult
to obtain exact estimates. BeN-
VENUTO CELLINI's works in gold,
if melted, would be equal in bulk
to two ordinary lumps of chalk.
The lamp-posts of London, placed
end to end, would extend to over
one hundred thousand times the
length of the ironwork of QUENTIN
MAtsys. Therefore, &c. Q. E. D.
The modern public buildings of
London, broken into small frag-
ments, would suffice to repair
some hundreds of miles of roads.
The Parthenon, similarly treated,
would not be enough for the
distance from Colney, Hatch to
Hanwell. The Crystal Palace is
larger than St. Mark's at Venice.
The Nelson Column is higher than
the monument of BARTOLOMMEo
CoLEoNI. Therefore, &c., Q.E.D.
It is thus conclusively proved
that the modern artistic produc-
tions of our beloved country are
infinitely superior — in b
to those so-called masterpieces
hitherto preferred by ignorant
critics. Mr. Punch, having
patriotically proved this incon-
trovertible fact, hopes that no
banquet will be offered to him
“by several influential gentle-
men’’ to reward him for these
“recent courageous, honourable,
and successful efforts.”

overcome? What are reverses
but simply temporary barriers
erected by Providence against the
too speedy gratification of our
headstrong desires? For my
own part, I rejoice in difficulties
and reverses of all kinds. When
I see either one or the other that
is seemingly insurmountable, I
say to myself, here is a pleasure
in store for me; let me not be too
eager to compass it, lest, by ex-
hausting it speedily, I cut short
my enjoyment.”
“My dear Sir, pray do not
imagine that I take your advice
in ill part. I assure, you my
greatest happiness and satisfac-
tion will be in endeavouring to
profit by it; and the freer you
are with me, the better I shall
like it. "good heavens, Sir!, what
a wretched world this would be if
our dearest friends and nearest
relations were debarred by in-
exorable custom from giving us
their counsel in due season.”
“I confess, for my own part, that
a good, healthy, vigorous oppo-
sition is a thing I rather enjoy.
Too much prosperity is bad for
any man; just as too much pywer
and fre:dom are bad for any
government.”

“What a blockhead the fellow
must be not to see that I am
dying for want of an º
to haveafinger in his pie. Now that
I have it there, I honestly believe
I shall make my fortune out of it.”
“Every kind of obstacle to the
gratification of what we esteem our
proper and reasonable desires is,
perse, detestable. Inever encoun-
ter an obstacle but it fills me with
rage, nor a difficulty but it makes
me rail against Providence. Still,
on a platform, in a pulpit, in a
book, or among one's friends, it
is necessary, of course, to hold
quite contrary language.”
“Confound the pragmatical
idiot! Will he never, cease
plaguing me with his tiresome
advice? What have I done that

the soldier's unprincipled principle that “all is fair in love and war.”
It struck me what a really good Tony Lumpkin Mr. SYDNEY BRough
might make if She Stoops to Conquer were the next revival at the
Court Theatre, that is, if this part were for once not given to an
‘‘ experienced low comedian.” Mr. BRANDoN THoMAs is an “illigant”
Sir Lucius, an exile from the most distressful counthry, a penniless
Irish baronet in search of an English heiress, and one of the “fine
ould Irish, gintlemen,” every inch of him. Mr. NYE CHART's Fag
is neat; Mr. CHEESMAN's old family servant Darid $ood, but rather
overdone, especially his laugh too; all “the laughs” appear forced.

prettily, but perhaps without sufficient touch of old-world exaggera-
tion, such as is implied in the name given her by SHERIDAN.
Poor. Julia and Faulkland! Who can sympathise with either
when they are both on together! I suppose Miss WIoleT RAYE is as
good as Julia can be, and that the same may be said of Mr. SUg DEN

able; you avoid the snobs, and
there is much less danger of in-

“WERY FISHy!”—'. During last month,” says, the Times of
November 12, “the officers of the Fishmongers' Company seized
thirty-one tons of fish at Billingsgate Market as unfit for human

extra-strong bad fish is too terrible to contemplate.

TO A. BALFOUR.
By a Lady Member of the Balfour Habitation
of the Primrose League,
[“I believe it was the Primrose League that
recognised the great truth that, whether women
ought or ought not to have a vote. . . . they are
rather more than half the human race in these
islands . . . and have a right to make their influ-
ence felt through the electoral machinery of the
country.”—Mr. Balfour in Glasgow.]

BFFORE the Primrose Eves,
Gathered by Clyde's dark shore-
Clustering from roof to floor,
Shaking with joy like tremulous leaves-
Waving thy snowy claspéd hand,
Which Primrose Dames adore,
Last night, oh blissl I saw thee stand,
Like a fair Prince from Fairyland-
Enchanter of the Primrose band,
Most beauteous A. BALFOUR.

Oh, it was like a dream
To dear mamma and me
Thy big soft eyes to set.
Upturned they did o'erflowing seem

Yet with true patriot fervour bold.

Persist in calling—fibsl

Like strains of Hope unknown,

HOW TO BE HAPPY.
(A Hint from Hawarden.)
[Mr. GLAnstone, writing of Mr. SPIRLMANN's
#º of Punch, says: “I shall be happy to see
in my library a work recording the history of a
prosperous and successful effort not only to
associate sound art with politics, but also to
humanise the warfare connected with a trying
mode of life.”)
MR, PUNCH is happy to acknowledge this
tribute so happily expressed, and hopes that
the º: of the illustrious recluse of
Hawarden has before now been increased—as
it must be—by a careful perusal of Mr.
SPIELMANN's excellent History, of which it
need only be said, that it is worthy of its
subject.
Breathes there the man, with soul so dead,
Who never to himself hath said
I'd like to fathom many a mystery
Concerning Mr. Punch's history?
If such there be, let him be shamed
By the great statesman, old, world-famed,
ho, far from party animosity,
Keeps up intelligent curiosity
Concerning England's other glory,
As well shown forth in SPIELMANN's story.
If such there breathe, let the poor dunce,
In true contrition, send at once,
Swift—aye, as England's champion wheel-
man-
For the great book of Mr. SPIELMANN,
And share, as Punch will hope he can,
The “happiness” of our Grand Old Man!

THE tutor of St. Mary's, Cambridge, was sitting in his rooms after

“Sit down, please, Mr. Jones,” he said to the last comer; “I
wish to speak to you very seriously on the subject of your work. The
College is not at all satisfied with your progress this, term. . For
instance, Professor KAILYARD tells me that your attendance at his
lectures has been most irregular.”
“Well, Sir,” said Jones, fumbling with the tassel of his cap, “I

A third student made his appearance in the doorway.
“Mr. Robinson, I'm sorry to say that your work is unsatisfac-

“HERE's ago,” I said, turning to SARK, after carefully looking
round the station to see if we really were back at Oban, having a
quarter of an hour ago started (as we supposed) on our tourney,
already fifteen minutes late.
“Well, if you put it in that way,” he said, “I should call it an
entire absence of go. I thought it was a peculiarly jolting train.
Never passed over so many Fº in the same time in my life.”
“Looks as if we should miss train at Stirling,” I remark,
ºly. “If so, we can't get on from Carlisle to Woodside to-
1ght.
“Oh, that'll be all right,” said SARK, airy to the last; “we’ll
make it up as we go along.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ROUNDABOUT READINGS,
OF THE SHOOTING OF FOXES.
THE other day a friend was relating to me his shooting experiences
in the United States of America. Amongst other incidents he
mentioned that, during one of his expeditions, he came to a place
where there were many foxes. These he was expected to shoot;
but, on the first day, his British hunting instinct revolted from the
idea, and he refused to fire at bold Reynolds. In reply to the re-
monstrances of his American companions he could ºnly urge that
having, during a long course of years, pursued the fox in land
with no weapon but a hunting-crop, he could not immediately rid
himself of the British prejudice which ranks vulpicide and parricide
together as the two chief crimes known to the Calendar.
THE American sportsmen retorted, naturally enough, that, as it
didn't happen to be their custom, in that
particular part of the country to ride after
foxes with * of hounds, they would be
much obliged to him if he divested himself
of his prejudices, took a reasonable view of
matters, and did his share in the shooting of
foxes. After some further hesitation, my
friend bowed to the force of these arguments,
and on the following day, lo and behold, he
bagged more of these sacred animals than
, the rest of the party put together. He is a
distinguished officer, with a brilliant record
and, humanly speaking, many years of useful
activity still before him. I shall, therefore,
Heap his name secret, lest, by divulging it, I should ruin him in the Q
estimation of his fellow-countrymen, and compel him to retire into
the unmerited obscurity of half-pay.
In this country, of course, the extermination of the fox provides
sport and the most glorious of healthy exercise for thousands and
Qusands. It teaches not merely .# horsemanship, but courage,
quickness of resource, and endurance. It provides an engrossing
persuit to men who might otherwise find no vent for their energies:
without it conversation in certain parts of the country would languish
and die. For all these reasons fox-hunting, according to the con-
ventions we have established here, is a sport that it would be the
merest folly to oppose. And unless fox-shooting were made a quasi-
capital offence there would soon be very few foxes left to be chased
| Tearaway, Tipstaff, Trimmer, Music, Melody, and all the rest
i. the celebrated hounds who stream every day over our country-
810ie.
IWAS once a member of a shooting party in Yorkshire. One of us
was an excellent old sporting parson, whose gun did great execution
amongst the partridges. As we were walking through a turnip-
field where the cover was very thick there was a sudden flash of
brown fur in front of the parson. “Hare,” said one of the beaters,
incautiously: “No, no; fox,” shouted another; but he was too
late. The reverend gentleman had fired, and a fine dog-fox lay
quivering about twenty yards in front of him.
THE incident cast an impenetrable gloom over the party. We did
not dare to joke about it. The occurrence was, too tragic, the
involuntary fox-murderer was too deeply plunged in melºn holy.
He unloaded his gun, gayº it to one of the keepers, and said, in a
voice of stony despair, “I’ll shoot no more to-day.” A little later
he, seemed to cheer up, smoked a pipe with apparent zest, and was
able to take a little solid food at lunch. But at tea-time, when our
hostess asked him not to give way, but to bear up for the sake of his
family and his attached parishioners, he could only shake his head
gloomily and murmur, Ah, what will #. think of me now P” It
was in vain that she rallied him, and said that one might imagine he
had shot a child. “I almost wish I had,” was the sorrowful reply.
OF course the old man saw clearly enough what would be the
consequences of one rash moment. hat did it avail him that he
had been a zealous minister of the º that he had conducted his
Sunday-school with credit, that he had preached two sermons every
week, with exemplary, regularity, that he had on more than one
occasion entertained the archbishop of his province, that his wife
had organised coal and blanket funds, and found an abundance of
needlework for the leisure of the female parishioners, and that he
himself had sung “There’s a bower of roses by Bendemeer’s
stream” at countless concerts with constant favour?" All this record
of good works, he knew, would count for nothing. Henceforward he
would be known far and wide as “the parson who shot a fox.”. In
short, # had goae, out of his life for ever, and though he might
water his i. with his tears he would never be able to wash away
this terrible stain. Therefore he did right to be unhappy.
WHAT became of him afterwards I cannot say with certainty.
But, last, week, as I was passing through Bury Street, I saw, a
musical family in rags and tatters slowly singing its way up the
street. There was a shrunken, miserable father; a shawled, and
tearful mother walked beside him leading two wobegone children,
and all were singing the most despairing and melancholy strain. As
I passed I looked at the father. Something in his face seemed
familiar; could it be?—but before I had time to make i.
inquiries he grasped his wife by the arm, the singing ceased, an
the whole dismal troupe shuffled away into Jº Street. this
was indeed, as I more than half suspect, my old clerical fellow-
sportsman, it must be admitted that his punishment has been severe,
ough not, perhaps, unjust.
“A MONTAGU ' "
(Mr. Punch's Appeal on behalf of the Montagu Williams
Blanket Fund.)
“For we are all one flesh,
And need one flannel—with a proper sense
Of difference in the quality.”
So said Mrs. BRowNING, qualifying obvious truth with a touch of
feminine satire. The first portion of the quotation would make no
bad motto for “The Montagu Williams, Blanket and Clothing Fund
all (Worship Street).” The fund was started by that worthy magistrate,
and man, whose too early loss is still deplored, “because he saw how
much the º of the East End suffered through lack of clothing,
and especially the children, many of whom are sent to school half
clothed and half fed.” “Such cases” (says Mr. JoHN MASSEY,
. E. T. S. Missionary, writing to the Daily News), “receive our
first attention.”
“Quite right !” says Mr. Punch. “Think of the comfort for
the comfortless represented by the distribution of 2000 blankets!”
Qh respectable cits with warm hearts—and slow livers—
Just picture poor children a prey to “the shivers,”
A slight fit of which, when the wind's in the East,
§: the rich man at his fireside or feast.
ith them they are chronic one half of the year,
For fires they can't #. for, and blankets are dear.
Oh satins and silks have their laureates fine
In whom fashion and splendour inspire every line;
But who'll write an Ode to a Blanket? The theme
Might inspire a true bard more than mere morbid dream.
Punch must pen it some day! But his present intent
Is to help, and increase by a hundredë. cent.,
Good MonTAGU WILLIAMs's Fund. Gentle readers,
To you at this season come plentiful pleaders.
But what you can spare for one more worthy channel,
Punch gives you his tip—Put the cash into Flannel !
Misapplied ? Mr. MAssEY bears witness that since the fund was
initiated four years ago one blanket only *::::::: its way into the
pawnshop § that was returned by the worthy pawnbroker), though
nearly 2000 have been distributed. 560 families or 4600 persons, have
been helped, and “many men and women have been re-started in
life by a gift of decent clothes, restoring them to the level of
respectability.” -- - -
hat more need be said? Save that contributions may be sent to
the magistrates, Mr. H. J. BUSHRY and Mr. HADEN,CoRSER, at
Worship Street Police Court, for the Blanket and Clothing Fund;
whilst parcels of clothes will be gratefully received by Mr. John
MAssEY, at 20, Albion Road, Dalston, N.E. As Portia might
have said:—
The quality of MAssEY (like that of his blankets) is not strained,
It droppeth like the sun's warm rays from heaven
Upon the poor when winter chills that sun;
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes
(Those blankets, following kindly MonTAGU), .
And earthly wealth seems then least Mammonish
When MAssEY moves its mercy.
PoRTSMOUTHIANA (from our Special South Coast Inspector):-The
Town Council is ultra-monarchical, boasting two Kings; while the
Bench rivals Temple Bar, having a Griffin of its own. The sea forces
are, appropriately *f; in charge of a Salmon; a rare Davis looks
after those in terris. Democratic opinions appear to prevail in the
Dockyard, for Prince George is being continually hammered. The
arrival of the Russian squadron has created a rise in tallow.
A SURE CARD.—By this time the Christmas Card should be played
out. It isn't; but, instead, it is “dealt out” by RAPHAEL Tuck
AND SON, who hold good hands, mostly trumps.

THE COMPANY PROMOTER'S
WADE MECUM,
Question. Is it absolutely necessary that a
constructor of companies should have any
capital?
Answer. Not in coin; but it is desirable
that he should be able to draw on a reserve
fund of unlimited assurance.
Q. And is it essential that he should enjoy
a spotless reputation ?
A. Of course such an endowment would be
extremely advantageous, but it is scarcely
imperative.
Q. º he not to be a well-known man f
A. If his record is irreproachable, but
otherwise it might be convenient were his
identity unrecognisable.
Q. Should the company he proposes to pro-
mote be suggestive of an attempt to º; a
want
A. No-not necessarily. The objects of a
company must not be confused with the aims
of a charity.
Q..Then what should be the end of an
association of limited liability ?
| A. The acquisition of enormous profits.
Q. Should the means taken to obtain this
| end be of a praiseworthy character
A. To be perfectly safe they should recom-
mend themselves to the approval of the com-
pany's solicitors.
| Q. What is the first step towards forming
a. º: -
A. The drafting of the prospectus.
Q. How should a prospectus be drafted?
| A. In such a manner that the maximum of
effect may be produced at the cost of the
minimum of deception.
Q. Should an appeal be made to the bene-
volence of investors?
A. Only as an additional º: to
speculation; the chief object of attack should
be human cupidity.
Q. What argument should be used in
obtaining the public .#. ?
A. That investors had already securedlarge
|É. by taking part in some scheme of a
indred character.
Q. Should there not be a strong board of
directors?
| A. Yes, and that strength should be shown
in the titles in abundance, either before or
after the names of the members.
Q. Why do you draw a distinction between
before and after P
A. Because, if a director is neither a peer
nor a baronet, he should be at least the
chairman of some other company.
Q. Are not hereditary titles nowadays
rather at a discount?
A. Amongst seasoned speculators, but they
are still popular with those who are investing
their money for the first time.
Q. Having published a prospectus and ob-
tained aboard, what must the promoterdonext?
A. He must see that the expenses an
renumeration incidental to his own labours
are not absorbed by the amount expended
upon advertisement.
Q. The shares having been allotted and a
handsome sum appearing at the bankers, what
should be the promoter's next care?
A. To obtain a cheque of adequate value
payable to bearer.
Q. And having cashed it, what should be
his consolation should the company hereafter
enter into liquidation?
A. That if thousands were ruined, he had
taken the precaution to keep on the rightside
of the law.
URBS IN RURE—THE FARMER'S FUTURE.
PARson says “I ought to be glad to be
an Essex farmer breathing pure air into my
lungs.” I tell parson “pure air won't pay my
rent for me.” He says rents have been re-
duced. Yes, but they aren't reduced as much
as I am. He says “living off the land” is the
healthiest thing a man can do. Wish I had a
chanceoflivingoff the land. Wouldn'tliveonit.
When will somebody do something for us?
Somebody has G. E. Railway has re-
duced its rates to London. Can send double
as much now for a shilling as I could before.
Must use company's own boxes, however.
Still, I don't mind that. Orders for fowls,
turkeys, fresh eggs, vegetables and fruit
coming in fast, from London families. Chance
of making the boys useful. Keep them at work
of nailing and directing boxes all the morning:
Hurrah! Government has “reduced local
burdens.” Rates cut down to half what they
were. Glad I voted Tory. Hullo! Notice from
landlord that “in consequence of greatdecrease
of local charges he thinks the time has come to
raise my rent!” Sorry I didn't vote Radical.
Shall next time. If it weren't for the rent,
now, I should be clearing a good profit.
Rent needn't trouble me, it seems. .Strong
Radical government. Going to “nationalise
the land.” Light railways being built all over
the place. Can send ton of potatoes to town
for twopence-halfpenny. Jam factories started
everywhere, too—no difficulty in getting rid of
my turnips now. Chimneys don't look pretty
in the fields, certainly. Rush from towns
to country. Building going on everywhere.
Makes air rather smoky. Still a good thing
to “put people on the land,” I suppose.
Got three railways coming past my front
door. Jam factory in next field. Rows of
cottages down by the stream where, trout
used to be. No trout now. Parson tells me
that grass is growing in streets of Bayswater
owing to thiſ movement into the country.
Says his church is to be enlarged. He hates
it all. So do I. Why can't the people stay
in London? Taken to growing their own
produce, and don't want mine.
Parson off to a living in EastEndof London.
Says he “must have pure air.” Whole of
Essex densely populated. County has become
a larger London. People have been “put on
the land,” and no mistake. Every man his
own farmer nowadays, so no need for me.
Sell farm, and away to Canada!

SONG TO SIMS REEWES.
(A long way after Hood's Hymn to the Sun.)
By AN OLD ADMIRER.
GIVER of golden notes 1
Though now a god of scarce-remembered
ays
Others may follow
Some new Apollo, -
I love thy song, and gladden in thy praise.
King of the º: tribe,
Still poets' hymns of right to thee belong,
Though some are cold
Who heard of old
Thy matchless phrasing, thymellifluous song.
Lord of the gracious bow -
The listeners to thy ballads held their breath.
Still dost thou save
From Time's chill grave
Such lingering sweets as love would snatch
from death.
Dreams of a greater day,+
When loud acclaim like incense-clouds did
rise
At thy last note,<
Before me float,
And bring the mist to an old buffer's eyes.
Truly “My pretty Jane”
Shall never more be sung as sung by thee.
Shall we applaud
Another “Maud’’
As we did tiºn all seemed youth and
glee
Our dear old DIBDIN, tool-
When shall the Jack Tar's laureate find a
To sing in tones [voice
Grim ñº, Jones
Might melt at, how tars fight, love, grieve,
rejoice?
That song l—“Here a sheer hulk!”—
Ah! how mellifluous memories come rolling
Like eve's soft haze,
With that first phrase
Of thine immortal, magical “Tom Bowling.”
Our noble NELson's death,
MAcGREGoR's mingled battle-whoop and wail,
Despair that lay
In Biscay's bay,
And the swiftrapture of that shout, “A sail!”
Who like our own SIMS REEVE8
These varied lyric moods in song could render?
ELIJAH's woe,
Or the blent gloom and glow
Of the great grief-thrilled Master's love song
tender P
If now a lesser stage
A lessening Hºlume, “Tom Bowling”
Draws loving cheers,
And the crowd's ears -
To the great tenor's tasteful warbling thrill.
Of late a sportive GRACE -
Gathered the well-earned meed of thirty
years.
Is Song less strong
To win the throng.
To something more substantial than their
cheers?
May fifty years of song,
Matchless in its pure art as PATTI's own,
No guerdon claim
Beyond high fame,
And mere word-tribute, to cold custom grown?
Pride of the lyric stage, -
Not all remember thy melodious prime;
But it shall leave
On winds at eve . .
A pleasant echo to the end of time!

anyone objecting to this being done, unless, of
course, the portrait in question were used to
illustrate an article on "Ugliness” or some
such dreadful subject as that... Nothing
pleases me more than to see myself in all the
papers, and I’m so afraid that this agitation
may §§ editors that I want to say to
everybody that I’ll give away any number
of photographs, so long as illustrations are
made out of them. Perhaps as I’m writing
I might say that I’m a very gifted young

tiful. I could play. The Secºndiſrº fondes-

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
|taining book when Alice in Wonderland is forgotten, but not
| till then.
As Macººrs finds his most dangerous competitor in him-l. At War with Pontiae, by King Monnor (Blackie and Sox) tells
self. When Messrs. HopDER & Stoughton bring out a new series of
stories from his pen under the title The Days of Auld Langsyne,
the heart, untravelled, fondly turns back Beside the Bonnie Briar
Bush, and doubts whether anything quite as well can be done. The
earlier work had the advantage of breaking fresh ground. The
denizens of Drumtochty were new to the poor Southerner, and he
was able to accept even more than a reasonable amount of testimony
to their uniformly angelic nature—high-minded, high-spirited, gene-
rous, poetical—underlying a rugged exterior. In the second collec.
tiºn ºf records of this remarkable community they are more generous,
self-denying, spiritual than ever. To tell the truth, the succession
of doses of sweetmeats has a tendency to pall on the palate. For that
reason the stories were more effective when they came out at intervals
in periodical F. That only means that the man or woman
happy enough to possess the book should not attempt to read it right
through at a sitting, or a succession of sittings. One a week will
have a wholesome effect, cheering mortals who dwell amid less
exalted communities with the assurance that there is hidden some-
where in the Highlands a hamlet where all the men are good and
most of the women are better. For real humour and true pathos,
expressed in most musical broken English, IAN MAcLAREN is, my
Baronite says, hard to beat in his latest work.
“Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might
appear to others that what you were or might have been was other-
wise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be
ºtherwise,” as the Duchess said to dear Alice in Wonderland; which
lucid remark fairly well defines the º: position of The
Wallypug of Why, by G. E. FARRow (Hutchinson & Co.) The
Girlie, and many of the jokes to be met with in the dreamy
Upsidedownness that leads to the Unanswerable land of “Why,”
are feeble imitations of , the immortal Alice. It may achieve
some popularity aided by the fººl". humour of HARRY
FURNIss's illustrations, and the dainty vignettes of his clever
daughter, DoRothy. The Wallypug of Why will be an enter-
how a hero, +not Valmond, “but another,”—not only, “came to
Pontiac,” but was saved from a fiery extinction by the discovery of
the Totem of the Bear! The “totem” is a kind of first cousin to the
tattoo—a sort of sign, in ºuts the globe, by which the generally
long lost brother is recognised.
Apparently we are losing something of our former British insular
pride, for S. BARING-Gould reproaches his countrymen with their
º of things, even literary, “made in Germany” and else-
where, to the neglect of home-grown talent. In defence he has
gathered together a deliciously quaint set of Old English Fairy
Tales (METHUEN), wherein children will find the native fairy quite
as charming as her foreign relatives.
Most appropriately appeared, a few days before the ninetieth
birthday of Mrs. KEELEY was celebrated by a public ovation in her
honour at the Lyceum, a book entitled The Keeleys, published by
BENTLEy, and written by Mr. WALTER GoodMAN. “Good
man and true; ” no better man could have been selected for the
work. The most memorable character that Mrs. KEELEY ever
played, indeed, her favourite part, was Jack Sheppard. Now
how came Mrs. KEELEY to be “cast” for Jack Sheppardº whose
inspiration was it to select her for this rôle 2. “I remember,” quoth
the Baron, “seeing KEELEY as Mouser, and his wife as Betsy, in
Betsy Baker ; both inimitable, being one among those few gems of
acting whereof the playgoer retains a life-long recollection.” As
a small boy, that is as small, a boy as the Baron could be, he
retains a vivid impression of Mrs. KEELEY, as a Peri, singing and
dancing in an extravaganza, and of Mr. KEELEY as Isaac of York in
a burlesque of Ivanhoe, also as Mrs. Gamp, with Mrs. KEELEY as
Young #. in Martin Chuzzlewit. To have remembered them,
and to have forgotten those who played with them (with the
exception of WIGAN as Montague Tigg), is clear evidence of the
impression these “two clever ones” made on the receptive mind

THE manner of it was in this way. Understand clearly that there
was not a word to be said against CINDERELLA—not a shadow of a
breath. She was good and lovely, with green eyes under eyebrows
as black and as straight as the borders of the Indian Gazette when
a big man dies. But– Well, her step-sisters werejealous of her.
Which is curious;
One evening they went to a Ball at Government House, leaving
CINDERELLA. at home, crying. After that, I don't know what
happened., This much, is certain. CINDERELLA went to the ball
with no chaperon, and no card of invitation. And a wonderful
dress., Gorgeous. I can't describe it, but it was a thing that hit
you straight between the eyes and made you gasp. Don't ask
me how it was all managed. All I know is, that, in two twos, her
card was, full. She was a success with those Up Above. The
Prince fell in love with her. These sudden madnesses often affect
the sanest men. You cannot account, for them. CINDERELLA
married the Prince, and went Home. I neither know, nor very much

dishonestly golden, sparkling with peroxide and insincerity, framed
a face of such extraordi beauty that to behold it was to doubt
the genuineness of the creation.
CINDERELLA's relatives were more skilful at eating an expen-
sive dinner than at ordering a cheap one; and CINDERELLA, who did
the cooking, made it the business of her life to lead her family out
of temptation; she knew greediness to be their special snare, and in
helping them to conquer their tastes she found many opportunities of
gratifying her own. For instance, every evening during the week

CINDEREILA WATERS.
No. III. By G-RGE M-RE.
(4 Fragment of a Drama in Muslin and Glass.)
. . . . THE lamp had not been wiped, and the room smelt slightly
of paraffine, which nearly º the smell of grease and, the
acrid, and warm odour of a baked, potato, a fragment of which
remained on an unwashed plate. The mahogany dresser, with its
rºws of shining plates and dishes, the saucepan, frying-pan, sieves,
the spit on which a half-raw leg of mutton was hanging, all
claimed, to the practised eye of a connoisseur, the kitchen. On the
floor, in front of the fire, sat a short, square-faced girl in a dirty
mauve print dress, obviously not made for her. Her face seemed to
wear the expression of the country that produced her; a Saxon face
with the Sussex hills and downs clearly outlined on the cheeks,
green-grey, quiet eyes, like the sea on a calm morning, and a prº-
tuberant white cliff-like brow. A girl of twenty, short, strongly
built, with Guriously short arms and firm sausage-like fingers. Her
neck was plump, and her hair of so *...*. a brown that it
passed unnoticed. Her face usually escaped observation, being
generally taken for one of those masks that children are wont to put
on in the fashionable West End on the fifth of November.
In the still water of the sink, the shining plates and saucepans
had all the magic of reflected things... The kettle on the fire sang
plaintively, like the wind in the valleys where the wind never
wholly rests. The coal-scuttle seemed full of charm, of the fascina-
tion of deciduous objects. , CINDERELLA, WATERs toyed, with the
cinders, large and small cinders, cinders like pebbles, and beetle-like
cinders. Blacksmuts hung caressively on CINDERRILA's oyster-shell-
like ears, on her flaxen eye-lashes, and her Saxon cheeks. Her flesh
warmed under the fire-light, but she sighed as she thought of her
hard life, work from week's end to week's end, never, a holiday,
never a little amusement. Outside, a full moon floated like a balloon
high up in the sky, and the trees stretched out their arms like faint
É. In these moments the plausive and wilful sweetness of
ife tempted CINDERELLA; she longed to be in the place of her sisters,
she had dressed them for the servant's ball. The eldest had put on
a black silk dress adorned with a wide collar fastened with a N.
fine pebble brooch. The other wore a canary-coloured skirt, a
velvet bodice, and a drab feather boa. Pale blue sashes floated from
º: hips, and one cruld hardly have recognised them as servant-
girls
With a sigh, she tried not to think of the glare and rustle of silk
of waltz tunes. She rose and began slowly ironing out some ragged
dusters. . . . Then she started and her flesh burnt, for the red-hot
flat-iron that she had accidentally dropped on her foot seemed to her
like a message from a lover. . . .

THE REMEDY FOR AGRICULTURAL DEPRESSION.
HER HEART AND HAND.
(Being the Last (hapter ºf an Unpublished
Romance.)
So they two paced up and down the garden
path in the moonlight. Their future course
(like the garden path) lay clear before them.
With the death of Enwin's unscrupulous
rival by a convenient railway accident in the
É. chapter, every obstacle at length
ad been removed. ANGELINA felt that the
dénouement was close at hand, but a few
more lites were required to complete the
volume. She paused beside a rose-bush.
“You have something to say to me,
EDWIN ?”
“ANGELINA,” murmured Edwin, “will you
give me your hand?”
“Oh!” cried ANGELINA. “That's really
too old-fashioned a proposal. Try again.”
“Nonsense, ANGELINA; I wasn't speaking
of marriage. I want you to give me your
hand literally—so,” and taking her dainty
fingers in his own, he bent reverently over
h r palm. Then neither of them moved for a
few moments.
“Do be quick,” said ANGELINA, im-
patiently. “You can kiss it if you like,
and then I'll snatch it away, while a ros
blush mantles over my cheek. But this is all
horribly old-fashioned.”
Edwin suddenly dropped her hand with a
gesture of dismay.
ANGELINA gasped.
. “All is over,” he said, solemnly. “The
line of life is fairly well marked; but the
line of the heart shows that you are utterly
devoid of real affection. Then the abnormal
development of the mount below the little
finger—”
“That came from rowing you up the river
yesterday!”
“—betokens obstinacy and bad temper.
Nay, 'tis useless to expostulate, ANGELINA.
In chapter twenty-two, if you remember, you
found me in the library, trifling with a book.
That book was the latest manual of Palmistry,
which declares that “it is the height of folly
to choose your partner for life without care-
fully studying the infallible revelation of
character afforded by the hand.’ I have
acted on that advice, and our marriage, con-
sequently: is out of the question.”
“But then,” cried º ANGELINA, “what
has been the good of all the previous chapters?
And what will the readers say?”
“They will regard it as a strikingly original
termination,” said Edwin, with gloomy satis-
faction.
“I shall bring an action for breach of
promise.”
“You cannot,” retorted Edwin. “We are
on the last page already.”
ANGELINA's composure gave way utterly.
“It’s too bad l’” she sobbed. “I did think
we were to be married, and to live happily
ever after. Now I suppose we shall appear
in a horrid modern series, with a cynical title,
The Folly of Romance, perhaps ' '
EDw1N smiled slightly. “No,” he replied,
“it will be called The Wisdom of Chiro-
Y|mancy.”

SIR,--I am sure you will
believe me when I say that I
wish to treat our new Com-
mander-in-Chief with the
greatest respect, but it is diffi-
cult to know what to say or
think when Field Marshal
Wiscount Wolselry delivers
himself of the following extra-
ordinary opinions. The place
was the Royal United Service
Institution, and the occasion
was the delivery of a lecture
upon “The Training of Volun-
teer Officers,” by Colonel
EUSTAcE BALFour. Here is a
report of the remarks to which
I have the honour to take
exception:-
“He had often watched out of
his room a non - commissioned
officer drilling a squad of recruits
The language which he used was
perhaps not of the choicest de-
scription, but it was very effec-
tive. ... (Laughter and “Hear,
hear.”). It was addressed to men
who thoroughly understood it.
(Laughter.) The drill sergeant
made use of that language with
great effect on the men, and he
impressed on them that they
should be absolutely obedient to
every expression, every word of
command.”
Now, Sir, if this means any-
thing, it º that in
future “the big, big D" of
the past should become the
amplified curse of the present.

THE LITTLE DINNER OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY.
A Forecast by Mr. Punch's Own Clairvoyant.
Accorpiva to the “Daily Chronicle,” “an American professor is
looking forward to the time when cooking and dining shall become
lost arts, and we shall take our sustenance in the form of tablets of
cºncentrated things.” Our esteemed contemporary appears to think
that such a system would necessarily do away with all conviviality
and social intercourse; but, unless Mr. Punch's Clairvoyant is
liable to error (which is absurd), we need not take quite so gloomy
a view of the future. People will still entertain, only the dinner of
the next century will be a more economical and less tedious function,
and, instead of haring to go through a trying iuterview with her
cook, the coming hostess will merely look in at the nearest Food
Chemist's, when some such conversation as the following will settle
the whole business.
Hostess. We’ve some people coming in to take a few tablets with
us this evening, what do you think I’d better have P
The Food Chemist. You will require soup, of course, Madam. I
could send you one of these patent soup-sprinklers, exceedingly
simple to work, and quite the fashion in the highest circles; the
.. º: each guest before showing them upstairs. We supply
the machine, charged with the very best soup, at ninepence a night.
Hostess. No, I don't want anything fussy, it's quite an informal
little ºf: An ounce of those mock-turtle jujubes at fourpence
I had last time will do very well.
The F. C. Very good, Madam. Then, with regard to fish? I can
strongly recommend these bi-carbonate of cod and oyster sauce
lozenges, or I have some sulphate of salmon and cucumber pastilles,
that I think you would like, ninepence the quarter-of-a-pound.
Hostess. I'm afraid I mustn't be extravagant. I'll take a small
bottle of condensed smelt tabloids (the sizpenny size) and what are
left will come in nicely for the children's dinner next day.
The F. C. Precisely so, Madam. And as to entrées—will you
have cockscomb cachous or sweetbread pilules?
aſſº". It makes such a long dinner. I don't want a lot of
1ng 8.
The F. C. In that case, Madam, I think I have the very article—
a most elegant electro-chemical preparation, combining entrée, joint,
and bird, with just a trace of vegetable matter, put up in small cap-
sules, at one and elevenpence halfpenny the box of one dozen. -
Hostess. That would be cheaper than having each course in
separate tablets, wouldn't it? I think I'll try a box. What
wonderful improvements they bring out nowadays, to be sure!
The F. C. They do indeed, Madam. I am tºld that the Concen-
trated Food, Stores will shortly be able to place, on the market a
series of graduated wafers, each containing a complete dinner, from
a City banquet to a cutlet, at prices to correspond with the number
of courses required. - - - -
Hostess. Delightful! And then the most expensive dinners will
be all over in a minute, instead of dragging on to ten minutes or a
quarter of an hour, as I've known them to do sometimes' I've
often thought what a pity it is that we waste so much precious time
as we do in merely supplying our bodily wants. . . -
The F. C. We are improving, Madam, slowly improving. And
what about sweets, cheese, and savouries?
Hostess. I might have one of those two-inch blocks of condensed
apple-tart, and a box of cheese pills—no savouries. You see it's
only a family party! -
The F. C. Exactly so, Madam. And shall you be needing any-
thing in the way of stimulants?
Hostess. Let me see—you may send me in a couple of ounces of
acidulated champagne drops—the Australian quality, not the
French, they’re twopence an ounce dearer, and so few people notice
the difference nowadays, do they?
The F. C. (to himself). Not until the next morning ! (Aloud.)
And liqueurs? Any brandy-balls with the coffee creams? We have
some very fine essense-of-dessert jellies—
Hostess. Nothing more, thank you. (To herself, as she departs.
I’m sure I’ve spent quite enough as it is on John's stingy ol
relations, who never ask us to have so much as a lunch-lozenge or a
tea-tabloid with them!

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
The SoRRows of SATAN–AND ONE OTHER.
I MAY as well unburden my mind at once by making a confession;
It will give pain to a great many whose good opinion Iyalue, but I
can't help that. It is better that they should be told the whole
truth, better that they should know at once the very worst that can
be said or thought of me, than
that I should continue to win their
respect by acting a lie. And, after
all, who amongst us is entirely
faultless? Is there one who can
lay his or her hand on his or her
heart and say with sincerity “I
have never erred” P Not one, I
am certain. My friends, there-
fore, may E. forgive me (not
immediate ut later on
y, perhaps
after time has . the pain of
the first shock) when I admit sor-
rowfully that I have been reading
The Sorrows of Satan, by Miss
MARIE CoRELLI.
CERTAIN points I might, urge in
extenuation of my conduct, in
mitigation of sentence. I might
say, for instance, that I. have
always been subject to a distinct
weakness for silver wings on a
green ground. Whenever I have
met them in real life I have in-
variably done something wrong.
Now, Miss MARIE CoRELLI's book is bound in a green cover, and on the
front of it is stamped the picture of a really lovely pair of wings in
silver. They are long wings, somewhat sparsely feathered, perhaps,
but they taper beautifully. ##"; at the sight of them reposing
peacefully on one of Messrs. W. H. SMITH AND Son's best bookstalls,
my moral nature crumbled, so to speak, and bang went six shillings.
I, MIGHT add that I didn't read the whole book. Two solid thirds
of it I read, and then suddenly something inside, me snapped, and I
began to skip as joyfully and heartily as any village schoolgirl with
her simple rope. These were not ordinary skips, but good, full-
blooded, lofty leaps, that carried me through, panting and breath-
less, but safe, to the very end. . As I say, I might urge these points
in extenuation, but I prefer not to. I have Fº guilty: let me
be punished, if any further punishment should be thought necessary.
All I can say is, that I promise never, never to do it again.
So far as one can judge from the book itself, Miss CoRELLI's object
in writing it ºr. to have been to “have a smack” at various
people who had incurred her enmity for having publicly expressed
their dislike of some of her previous work. iss CoRELLI keeps a
diary,. I can imagine that a page of it would be something in the
following style:— -

what I may call overfed detail; there are bounders and snobs

there is one female novelist, of extraordinary genius, whom the per-

name is, if my memory serves me, Maris Clarelli, or something of
that sort. She writes wonderful novels, and º a big St. Bernard,

eyes, a glorious baritone voice, and any amount of other diabolical
attributes. , He is lavishly described in a kind of water-Ouida style,
and when last seen, he is in company with a well-known Cabinet
Minister. The devil is “the same as ever, the perfect impersona-

CARLO, THE CYNIC.-A 'Fable.
CARLo, the Puppy, one day took it into his head to become a great
cynic. There are few puppies that have not at some time or other
conceived the same mad project. Says Carlo to himself, “To be a

uneasiness of dog-kind; my digestion will be, always out of, order;
my appearance as disengaging as it can possibly be. Still, all this is
so easy that there is really no merit in accom i. it.” -
Carlo then retires into his tub, determined to play the part his
folly assigns him. No sooner is he embarked on a sulky nap, than
an opportunity presents itself to him to act up to his new character,
The son of his master passing by at that moment, Carlo springs out
upon him, and attempting to seize the littlefellow by the leg, proceeds
to terrify him with #. growlings. The child, alarmed by the dog

AIR-" The Happy Fatherland.”
Owe Britons are a blundering lot, and too apt
to miss our tips.
Once on a time we supplied the world with
fine engines and big ships.
But we’re very blind, and we’re very cross,
and seem daily growing wuss:
Therefore the Fatherland, the Un-napping
Fatherland, keeps a watchful eye onus.
O those Teutons are a wakeful race, and you
bet they know their book;
And they’ve learned all that we had got to
teach them, by hook and eke by crook,
And more and more all the things we use are
now “made in Ger-ma-ny.”
Whereat the Fatherland, the Artful Father-
land winks its eye with wondrous glee.
Napping Britons have a notion still that
Britannia rules the waves;
But to party spleen and class enmity (if to
nothing else) we’re “slaves,”
Which we swore we'd “never, never, never”
be, and we quarrel might and main,
Whereinthe Fatherland,thechuckling Father-
land, spies a prospect of great gain.
For we Britons in our shipyards big know the
way to build a fleet,
Which for strength and speed and for engines
prime is tarnation bad to beat.
But we bring it all to a dire dead-lock by a
dodge called a “lock-out,”
Whereat the Fatherland, the Teuton Father-
land, laughs and hugs itself, no doubt.
For the men of old having played the fool,
now the masters take their turn,
And though better far they did ought to
know, they too stubborn seem to learn.
Since they stop their works, and shut out their
men, from what they call “sym-pa-thy,”
What time the Fatherland, the Clever Father-
land, snaps up business from J. B.
Sºrikes drove the ship-trade from the Thames
to the Tweed and to the Clyde.
And now lock-outs close the northern yards,
which were once the Briton's pride.
So the Chinaman and the Jap will have for to
get their ships elsewhere:
Where—the Fatherland, the Un-napping
Fatherland will make its especial care.
0, these masters are a mulish lot, for it seems
their fault this time;
Such unpatriotic and stubborn greed is a folly
and a crime.
And it's time John BULL did put down his
foot, for that matter both his feet.
Before the Fatherland, the Teuton Father-
land has to build the British Fleet !
We’ve a Fatherland, unto which belong both
the masters and the men.
If we nap too long nations wide-awake will
snap up our trade, and then *-
Mr. Punch desires with the smashing force
of an Armstrong plus a Krupp
To tell our Fatherland, our Napping Father-
land it is high time to WAKE UP!

OWER-BEHRING CONDUCT.
[By the arbitration of Paris, judgment was given
in favour of Great Britain with respect to the
Behring Sea Dispute, but the precise amount of
the damages was left for settlement to the two
Governments. The British Ambassador and Mr
GREsh AM drew up an agreement, duly signed and
sealed, fixing the sum at £85,000, but the House
of Representatives in February last rejected the
vote. Fresh negotiations have now to be entered
on. —Daily Paper.]
Sir Julian Pauncefote sings dolefully:-
I thought it all was done
When their case was lost, ours won,
By decision of the Paris arbitration,
That the Behring Sea affair
Would no more cause mal de mer,
And a cheque on BARINGs settle compensa-
tion.
But alack' and welladay,
Cousin JonATHAN won't pay,
But insists upon renewed negotiations,
And his method democratic
Is not strictly diplomatic,
Or according to the laws that govern nations.
Says JonATHAN, “Friend JoHN,
We don't want to split upon
A matter in which you have all the glory,
For we own, with due contrition,
That we hold a false position—
But there—parting is a very different story.
It is true, in manner handsome,
You gave Alabama ransom,
And you paid your cash without recrimina-
lon ,
But we know a thing or two,
And we're cuter, John, than you,
So sealing-wax is all your compensation.”

Question. Can you give me a list of the
qualifications necessary to produce an average
amateur actor P
Answer. Self-assurance, and an unreason-
ing desire to attract attention.
Q. Is it essential that you should be able
to act P
A. Not absolutely. If you have a fairly
retentive memory, and can imitate—more or
less—the manner of some recognised theatrical
star, you should be perfectly satisfied with
the performance.
Q. Assuming that you neither can recollect
nor copy, how should you supply the de-
ficiency?
4. By a blind reliance upon the prompter.
Q. What should be your relations with the
audience?
A. If possible, of a friendly character.
You may do much to insure this desirable
condition by the distribution of free tickets
amongst the more imbecile of your acquaint-
ances.
Q. Can you circulate gratuitous cards of
admission in other quarters with pleasing
results P
.A. Certainly. If you are of a vindictive
disposition, you can present the peace-de-
stroying cartels to your enemies.
Q. If the audience shows signs of dissatis-
faction, to what cause may you attribute this
attitude of hostility?
A. To the incompetency of your fellow-
actors.
Q. Then you may assume that you yourself
are above criticism?
A. Unquestionably; save, perhaps, in the
avowedly theatrical periodicals.
Q. If your efforts to instruct and entertain
are treated with contempt in those sources
of information, to what influence may you
confidently trace this unappreciative treat-
ment?

in a private performance?
A. With the intention of pleasing myself
and with the desire of giving the organiser of
the entertainment an opportunity of affording

Q. Why should the hospitality be lavish P
A. Because ample light refreshments and
an excellent supper in front of the footlights
cover a multitude of mistakes behind the
green curtain.
Q. What should be your object in taking
part in a public performance P
A. The same as in the case of a private
representation, an additional advantage would
be increased notoriety.
Q. What should be done with the proceeds
of such an occasion ?
A. The money collected should be devoted
to the payment of the necessary expenses.
Q. If there should be a balance, what
should become of it?
A. That is a question that would seldom
come within the range of interrogatories of
practical value.
Q. But should there be such a balance, to
what end should it be devoted P
A, (after a long pause). Oh, of course—to
the benefit of some deserving charity.

A MATTER FOR FURTHER
GONSIDERATION,
(Extract from a Volunteer's
Note-Book.)
12 Noon.—I have been
posted as a sentry near
this bridge to wait for
something exciting my
suspicions. When this
happens I am to “retire
at once and give the
alarm.” Quite so; but
many a battle has been
won by using one's own
discretion. I read in the
report of a recent lecture
that a Frenchman, by dis-
obedience to orders in the
Franco-German War, did
something or other that
saved the honour of his
country. So far so good.
Nothing stirring.
12.30.-I can see some-
thing moving to the right.
It may be cavalry or a
cow. Toss up. Heads
soldiers, tails cattle. The
latter wins. Not going to
“give the alarm” when
threatened by a cow, of
course not. So pass cow.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
My Baronitess tells me that in The Silver Fairy Book (HUTCHIN-
son & Co.), the youthful reader will find fairies and genii of every
nation ready to show how happily life succeeds in The Land of
Magic. She also informs me that ARTHUR For BES's Australian story,
about the man who went for His First Kangaroo, is calculated to
make the reader sit up-to read it. BLAckIE AND SoN are also
determined that youthful readers should, in Two Gallant Rebels,
learn something about La Vendée and La Guillotine. Both cheery
subjects for Christmas.
Lost Chords, by Mr. ARTHURRICKETT, is a practical joke, capitally
carried out by author and publisher. It is bound to deceive, the cover
being a closely burlesque'd reproduction of that of the well-known
Yellow Book, only with tuning-fork instead of key, as emblematical
of Lost Chords. Some of Mr. RICKETT's parodies are capital.
In The British Barbarians, Mr. GRANT ALLEN, at some length
but not without ingenuity, has perpetrated a literary “sell.” Not
without a laugh will the interested reader reach the climax, but he
will probably wish that this climax had been the finish; likewise
would he prefer to the somewhat prosaic ending that a few disjointed
lines should have finished off the romance, the author laughing in
his sleeve, contentedly. It is one of the bunch of keys of the
Hºte Series, and 'tis published by JoHN LANE of the Bodley
ead.
Stirring are the incidents of Mr. Joskeh HATTON's When Greek
Meets Greek. Let not the name affright the unclassical reader, who
may be inclined to fight shy of Homeric heroes. None such will be
found here; they are of the Revolutionary period in France, under the
misrule of Roºspººne ºr CIE., a period when, as Josephus HAT-
Tonius Historicus well says, “The Revolution, with the cry of
“Liberty, equality, fraternity' on its lips, not only revived the secret
and bloody horrors of the Middle Ages, but outdid them in private
and in public.” The Middle Ages were not in it with the Darkest
Revolutionary Age...The dialogues in this story are a bit diffuse,
and diffuseness in either dialogue or descriptive narrative is apt to
irritate the reader in a hurry. For, mind you, most readers are
in a hurry nowadays. Though, personally, the Baron * taking

Brown (laughing". Then I wish you jºy, my boy. If you really
want a good hearty guffaw go to “Dod.” -
Jones. Yes, it’s all very well to grin, but when a fellow's in a
hurry, he's in no mood for practical joking. They may well call it
Dºd's Parliamentary Companion, for I never met with anything so
irritating in all my life.
Brown. But surely it tells you the name of the boss at the Local
Government Board?
Jones. It does more than that—it gives you a choice of Pre-
sidents. On one page Mr. WALTER Long is mentioned; on another,
Mr. RITCHIE ; on a third, Mr. CHAPLIN. But the Editor isn't quite
satisfied about the last, because in another part of the book he
hails him as President of the Board of Trade. What shall I do? I
don't like to toss up, and writing a circular letter to all the lot will
take up a deal of time, and look rather foolish to the wrong ones.
Brown. Well, of course, if you will consult “ Dod” you must take
the consequences. Let me have a look at the book. (Turning orer the
pages.) hy, here's another mistake. He insists that Sir HENRY
CAMPBELL BANNERMAN was president in the days of Mr. GLADsroxE.
Jones. Oh yes, I noticed that. It is a wonder he didn't call him
Sir Herbert CAMPBELL.
Brown. That would have been quite in his line of humour. And
he might have said that Sir HERBERT CAMPBELL resigned the cffice
to form a cabinet with Mr. DAN LENo, to run the pantomime under
the Premiership of Sir Augustus DRURIolanus.
Jones. Yes, that’s all very well. But business is business; and
it has given me a headache.
Brown. Then try something less intricate. (Giving volume.) Just
cast your eye over this.
Jones. Ah, come, this is much better! [Scene closes in as the

ROBING-ROOM RUMOURS.
THE address of the distinguished Junior who was anxious to learn
the destination of the £600 per annum voted by the Inns to the Bar
Committee is believed to be Pump-Handle Court. The learned
gentleman who honours that famous locality with his presence, on
hearing that the money was not to be expended in helping.” the
deserving professionally unemployed,” expressed himself dissatisfied
with any other arrangement. •".
It is understood that no part of the £600 will be used as a “reserve
fund” for the smoking concerts given by the Bar Musical Society.
It is said that none of the money will be devoted to furthering the
interests of the excellent forensic charity feebly fostered by the Bar.
It is declared that at present the fate of the money is shrouded in
mystery. However, it is pretty certain that it will not be employed

It is not improbable that a prize will be offered by the B.C. for
the best essay answering the question, “What shall we do with it?”

The enterprising forensic perruquier who adorned the window of
his shop with a placard bearing the legend, “Our Lord Chancellor's
Wig Club has commenced,” is receiving daily a number of subscrip-
tions from the younger members of the Junior Bar.

There are strong reasons for believing that the rumour that the
only advice tendered to his new colleagues by a law officer of the
Crown who served in two consecutive Ministries, was “to resign,” is
not a canard.

Finally, to return to the subject of the hour, it is whispered that
the Inns of Court will raise the grant of £600 by permitting smoking
at lectures and making a profit out of the sale of cigars.
FROZEN FLOWERS. |
[A fine collection of blue and white water-lilies has been sent from a leading
florist in Sydney for presentation to the QUEEN. They were frozen in ice,
received here as long ago as August last, and have just been delivered in
perfect condition at Windsor.] *
JACK FROST, so long fancied the foe of the flowers, º º
You turn up to-day as their friend and preserver ! ºn
Though bred by the sun and refreshed by the showers, tº ºr
Their sole aids, ’tis clear, are not moisture and fervour.
The poets, who often are sciolist sillies,
Should stoop to consider these iced-preserved lilies.

They have thriven long years on conventional fiction;
But if-without frenzy—they use their own eyes
The dickens 'twill play with their secular diction.
Good gracious! How many fine rhymes had been lost,
Had they known about flowers made immortal by frost!
Frozen food, meat or fish, may, though tasteless, keep fresh,
For an aeon or so without causing great wonder;
But flowers are much frailer and finer than flesh,
And to freeze them immortal makes fancy knock under.
It may front an ice-preserved beef-steak or kidney,
But think of iced lilies six months out from Sydney!
The blue and white beauties full-bloom in the block
Outmarvel that elephant found in a glacier.
Great Flora, it comes on the Muse as a shock,
Makes bard-inspiration yet foggier and hazier.
Tinned dreams, pickled moonbeams and pemmican song,
Sound scarcely more funny, and hardly more wrong.
If flowers can be frozen and kept years in ice,
Why not—say, a few minor poets? They'd realise

NOT WITHOUT A PRECEDENT.
(From Our Prophetic Correspondent of a Future Campaign.)
WE are now settling down in our quarters, and really everything
is extremely comfortable. The camp is capitally arranged. The
first line is used exclusively by our general officers, the next by
those of field rank, then come captains of companies, and the
remainder of the tents go to subalterns. - --
“Don’t you find it rather awkward?” I asked our Brigadier
commanding-in-chief. -
“Well, no,” he replied; “you see, we don't expect there will be
much, to do, save to march to the capital and back again. And
special service men can do that quite as easily as ToMMY ATKINs.”
“Do you expect to use the guns much P”
“I hope not,” said our gallant leader. “They put s and
bjws and arrows º out of competition. However, the enemy
will probably bolt before we can get to him.”
“And what is the muster roll!”
“Let me see—we have two hundred colonels, three hundred
majors, and—”
! Yes,” I interrupted; “but how about the rank and file?”
“I am glad you reminded me,” was the response. “I knew I
wanted to show you something. Come along.”
Thus invited, I followed our Brigadier. TWe walked through the
lines until we came to a tent, pitched at some distance from the rest
of the encampment. startled by the clank of his commander's
sword, the occupant came smartly to “Attention.”
...And who may he be?” I asked, as I walked away.
“The greatest curiosity of the expedition,” was the prompt
response. “He is THE private.”
*Has he no comrades of the same rank º’”
“None. You see, we required all the accommodation of the ships
for the special service officers ”
“Then, why bring him? Surely he can be of very little use?”
“There you are wrong,” said the Brigadier; “he saves the situation.
He is out of place, but we must sacrifice something to appearances!”
And, on consideration, I think the speaker was right. Where
everyone is an officer, it becomes necessary to leaven the mass with
one private. Something must be sacrificed to appearances!

She haunts us like a modern Gorgon's head,

And the one in $.". I frankly own,
Is a simple ballad you used to sing !
Ah me, that quaint little sad refrain—
Haye you forgotten its old-time thrill?

To that grey old manor my thought takes

A BY-WAY OF HISTORY.
LAST Saturday, Mr. EdwarD CUTLER, Q.C.,
wrote to the Times informing the public how,
two years, since, he had written to the
Chamber of Commerce at Boulogne complain-
ing of the quality of the refreshments served
at their station, and pointing out how well
he had invariably been served by the buffet
at Calais after having been buffeted by the
merry sea-waves. But this is an old story.
Often has Mr. Punch, as Universal Traveller
for Everybody, remarked how well the Calais
buffet is managed; how you get everything
hot and hot (if your mind is only made up
beforehand as to what you are going to take),
and how everything hot, or cold, is, as the
har-man, not the Q.C. who writes about the
Cu-sine, but the bar-man at Monte Carlo
used to say, “Of the best, of the very best!”
To the much enduring, much suffering Ulysses,
there is only one route to Paris, and that is
from Victoria, per L. C. & D., cid Dover an
Calais; and at Calais there is only one restau-
ration which can restore the weary traveller
and that is at the Gare Maritime, to themut
profit of “Q.C.,” i.e., “Queer Customer,” and
j As CHARLEs THE SEcoRD said to
oCHESTER, when, after landing on the coast
of France, he had supped well and heartily at
the small hostelrie, which was the ancestor of
the present Terminus hotel, “Oddsfish, man!
but this “restauration' is a good omen for
me!” ESTER was apparently asleep,
but he subsequently appropriated the joke,
which was quoted as Roch EstER's own by
PRPys, and recorded as his by Sir Joseph
MILLER, K.J., much to the King's annoyance.

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
ON MRs, GAMP.
I YIELD to no one in my sincere admiration for Mr. A. B. WALR-
IEy. Week by week I watch him with delight wielding his dex-
terous and flashing rapier in the field of dramatic criticism. No man
understands better than he, none practises with greater praise, the
difficult art of literary, swordsmanship in connection with the
theatre. I say this to clear my conscience, for I want to have a
little bout with Mr. WALKLEY.
IN last week's Illustrated London News appears an article on
ALEXANDRE DUMAs, by Mr. WALKLEY. It is a subtle and discrimi-
nating piece of criticism. Certainly I have not the least desire to
impeach its arguments ºf its conclusions. But-Mr., WALKLEY, will
forgive the “buts”; he knows their value, and their occasional
jº am moved to protest against one incidental sentence,
which has nothing to do with the main purport of the article.
“DUMAs,” says Mr. WALKLEY, “at last began to see that man is as
weak as woman— as weak as flesh, if not weaker,’ as the lady in
Martin Chuzzlewit said of her husband's wooden leg.”
WHY, why, I ask, should
Mrs. Gamn ; as “ the lady in
Martin Chuzzlewit "f Is this Mr.
WALKLEY's concession to the prepos-
terous refinement of a generation which
is supposed to find the “vulgarity” of
DICKENs's characters little to its taste?
Are...all these immortal creations to be
similarly disguised ? Shall we be asked
to admire Captain Cuttle as “the ex-
navigator in Dombey and Son”? Is
Sam Weller to be known as “the well-
known valet in the Pickwick Papers”?
And is Mr. Peggotty to be disguised as
A “the Yarmouth smack-owner in David
Copperfield” 2. No, no, Mr. WALKLEY,
give us back Mrs. Gamp as we have
always known her, that is to say, as
our adored
Sairey Gamp trotted out.
Mrs. Gamp, and never call her “out of her name again.”
‘‘ ‘SAIREY,” says Mrs. Harris, in a awful way, “tell me wot is my
individgle number.’ ‘No, Mrs. Harris,” I says to her, ‘ex-cuge
me, if you please. My own,' I says, has fallen out of three-pair
backs, and had damp door-steps settled on their lungs, and one was
turned up smilin' in a bedstead, unbeknown. Therefore, Ma'am,' I
says, “seek not to proticipate, but take 'em as they come and go.’
‘Mine,’ said Mrs. Gamp, mine is all gone, my dear young chick.
And as to husbands, there’s a wooden leg gone likewise home to its
account, which in its constancy of walkin' into wine-vaults, and
never comin' out again till fetched by force, was quite as weak as
flesh, if not weaker.’”
THERE is the full quotation... Mr. WALKLEY knows it, of course,
uite as well as I do, but I could not resist giving it. It is a puré
§: merely to write it down. And one other passage, one from
the many that are immortal, I am impelled to quote. Here it is:–
“‘Which, Mr. Chuzzlewit,” she said, “is well beknown to Mrs.
Harris a has one sweet infant (though she do not wish it known) in
her own family by the mother's side, kep in spirits in a bottle; and
that sweet babe she see at Greenwich Fair, a travellin' in º
with the pink-eyed lady, Prooshan dwarf, and livin’ skelinton, whic
judge her feelins when the barrel-organ played, and she was showed
her own dear sister's child, the same not bein’.e t3d from the
outside picter, where it was painted quite contrairy in a livin' state,
a many sizes larger, and performing beautiful upon the 'Arp, which
never did that dear child know or do: since breathe it never did, to
speak on, in this wale l’”
YEs, you may rail at DICKENs as you will (this sentence, bien
entendu, is not addressed to Mr. WALKLEY), you may declare your
dislike of his exorbitant gift of easy tears, of all his stilted Tom
Pinchism, with its “thou” and “thy” and its blank verse; but
when you are brought, face to face with such passages as those I
have set forth, the master humorist resumes his throne, and all you
can do, having doffed a respectful cap, is to pay him the irresistible
tribute of laughter. . When I #: of the mawkish, dreary
decayed, §º." rubbish which encumbers our bookstalls, f
can only thank heaven for allowing us still to revel in the generous
sparkling wine of DICKENs's humour.
WE may thank heaven, too, that never shall a Mrs. Gamp or any
of her kind attend one of us in an illness. From the world of nurses
she has vanished. In her place comes an angel in a long veil, a
-
pure white collar and bands, and a dark dress—an angel of mer
and pity, with a gentle voice, who soothes our aching head, an
ministers to our wants, and smiles upon us when long hours of
pain and weakness have madeus fretful. When I remember the
perfect devotion; the simple unselfishness, the untiring care of one of
these dark-robed ministers, her watchful patience by the bedside of
a beloved friend, her eager zeal to anticipate his every want, to relieve
*..*. my heart goes out in deep thankfulness to the whole
sister -
If there be any, who still hesitate how they shall bestow their
Christmas gifts, let them think of the nurses and their quiet work,
Is there not a pension fund for nurses? If I knew the name and
address of its secretary I would set them down here, so that some
rivulet at least from the stream of Christmas benevolence might flow
in that direction.
“WELL PLAYED!”
THE Squire of Dames, by Mr. R. C. CARTON, at the Criterion, is not
what it is the fashion nowadays to style “a problem play.” Åii plays
must necessarily involve a problem; the principal problem being its
success. The †: of Dames, originally the L'Ami des Femmes
of DUMAS FILs, belongs to a class of which the Scrap of Paper and
Delicate Ground, are well-known types, and such a play as Still
Waters a variation. The Squire of Dames is not dramatically
a very strong play, but quite strong enough to enjoy a good run,
and to retain its popularity when other plays, more immediately
striking, have lost their temporary hold on the public. The Squire
of Dames is pleasant to see; it is interesting to follow; in morality,
it keeps on the safe side, and inculcates a wholesome lesson in the
cheeriest possible manner. Mr. Kilroy, a gentleman with a past and
a present, and most decidedly a future, who springs from nowhere,
belongs to no profession, and who is as near an approach to an imper-
tinent coxcomb as a kind of genial Sherlock-Holmes-Lavater-Paul-
Pry, self-elected as the good genius of several people, can be, is a
art played, as I venture to think, to perfection, by Mr. CHARLEs
Wº: whose sole fault is his excessive laughter, which seems
strained, and therefore unnatural.
Miss MARY MOORE represents the misunderstanding and misunder-
stood wife very sweetly; and, than Miss GRANVILLE, no one could be
named as a fitter representative of the handsome, fashionable, good;
hearted wife of Professor Dowle, a characterinimitably impersonated
by Mr. ALFRED BISHoP.
Little Mr. H. DE LANGE shows what a veritable hit can be made
with so small a part as is that of Lord Eustace. Mr. FRANK FENTON
is º admirable as Colonel Dennant, in whom, though little is
seen of him, the real interest is centred. The two scenes, which
are incontestibly quite the best in the play, are, first, the genuinely
touching interview between husband and
wife, and no praise can exceed the merit of
this performance, especially in so difficult a
part as is that of Colonel Dennant in this
situation,-and, secondly, the excellent love-
making, husband-catching scene between the
American millionairess, Zoë (what a mistake
to have given her the punning surname of
“Nuggetson?' ''), and Mr. # when
the biter is bit, and the catcher caught. This
is a genuine high-comedy situation, full, of
humour, and perfectly rendered by Miss FAY
DAVIS and Mr. WYNDHAM. -
What, by judicious acting, is prevented
from being the thankless part of Sir Douglas
Thorburn, the desperate young lover, only
elevated to the height of passion in order to
make his discomfiture the more ridiculous, - -
is played by Mr. BERNARD, Goulp with a rough kind of boyish
impulsive thoroughness that just wins the *# of the audience
for a youthful, unformed...character in which it is not difficult
to recognise, great possibilities for future ; It required an
artist for this part: we will not go behind the theatrical comedy-
mask of “BERNARD Gould’” and reveal a name so well and so
favourably known to the art-loving public, but we are sure that
Mr. WYNDHAM, yielded to a happy inspiration in securing his
services, as whatever else he may do, there is no doubt about Mr.
“BERNARD Gould” being able to “draw.”
OMISSION.—Last week the First Commissioner of Works sent “four
does” to the LoRD MAYOR and three to the sheriffs.. The Recorder
and the Remembrancer received only “one doe” a-piece; Now, as
these two officials are lawyers, a Roe should have been added in each
case, so as to keep up the ancient legal fiction of Doe and Roe.
Pity that old customs should die out.

MR. PUNCH read the other day that “hostesses are putting forth
commendable efforts to secure a sufficiency of partners for their young
lady friends. Invitations are sent out months, beforehand, and
accompanying them are chatty and interesting letters describing the
charms of the ladies who will be present, and §§ other particulars
which are calculated to “snare the particular bird.’”
Now, Mr. Punch's “young men” are proverbially attractive, and
a yery little inquiry amongst them has elicited the following (amongst
other) letters from their large collection. Hostesses hard up, please

DEAR MR. WATTABORE,--I am enclosing a card for our little
dance on the 12th of May, but I couldn't resist the temptation of
sending you this wee note along with it, to say how very, very
disappointed MABEL, RUTH, GRACIE, FiorEIE, MAUD, CoNNIE,
BERTHA (you know my husband's iittle joke about our house being
in the Seven Sisters' Road?) and I will be if you can't come. Now
do try to come; I promise we won't dance you too hard, and of
course we shan't think it rude if you sit out half the time, . Only,
do come. With very kind regards, in which **** join,
- Yours most sincerely, A DIFFIE CULTY.
P.S.–You may be interested to know that charming little ETTA
RILLAMILL-you remember her wonderful grey eyes—has definitely
decided to come, and bring her eyes with her. Then we have a con-
ditional promise from RACHEL LINKIN–the girl with the Trilby
feet. MILLIE MINK, too, the charming young actress at the Jollity,+
has promised ARCHIE she will look in a soon as her performance is
over. She will probably wear a wonderful gown, she is now having
designed for her, which I'm certain you’d like. At any rate,
ARCHIE has seen the design, and can talk of little else. you
would like to know any more details, pray don't hesitate to write
and ask me—I always think it’s so much better to know beforehand
what one has to expect. I. D. C.

going to have such a jolly dress—white, with delightful pink frills;
that will be very fetching. By the bye, isn't pink your favourite
colour? ... I fancy when I wore it, once before you said something
pretty about “pink of perfection.” Then we've ever so many nice
other girls coming, and from what I hear of their frocks, we shall
have a very stylish time, Now, you must write and say you’ll
come. And be sure to say if there's anything you can suggest that
we ought to do or have. We're quite determined to meet our
friends' wishes, and have a successful evening.
Yours ever, AMIE T.

HEROES AND HAT WORSHIP.
HAVE just been to CARLYLE's house. What bliss to reverently
touch his table, to feelingly fondle his fender, to hug-if it were
ermitted—his hat-case! But joy above all other joys, what supreme
appiness to gaze entranced at his old hat! Seem to remember some
remarks of his about old clothes, and also about the population of
this country being "mostly fools.”. Wonder if that includes devotees
like, myself. No, it cannot. This is the true Hero Worship. A
bright idea strikes me. I will form a museum of such personal
relics. . What a noble ambition for a lifetime! Will begin at once
by asking all the most shy and retiring writers of the present time
to give mewhat must be useless to them, but invaluable to me—some
old clothes. Imagine some entries in the catalogue of my future
collection.
..Mr. GRANT ALLEN: A pair of boots, with stout soles, useful for
hilltop climbing, and for trampling underfoot anything disliked by
the wearer. Worn by the great, writer whilst studying art, as
though it were science; science, with the light-hea gaiety of an
artist; fiction, as though it should only deal with unpleasant facts;
and facts, as though most of them were pleasing fictions.
“GeoRGE EGERTon.” A pair of goloshes, which enabled the
wearer to wade through some mud hitherto left undisturbed.
Mr. ERIC MacKay. A blacking brush, once used for the boots of
a Royal Prince, and given to him by a man emplºyed in a royal
boot-cleaning room. scribed by Mr. MACKAY, “My most valued
treasure.”
Miss MARIE CoºlEI. A glove which she wore on her right hand
after Royalty had shaken it, and her waste-paper basket, into which
she has never thrown anything which she herself has written.
Sir Edwin ARNoLD. A Japanese umbrella. Attached to it is
a poem by Sir Edwin; but this masterpiece is unhappily as in-

“selling their wives at Smithfield.”
Last week, in the Divorce Court, it
was proved that such a case had
actually occurred; only not at Smith-
field. A husband sold his wife for
twenty pounds, and gave a receipt.
Then the simpleman sued for a divorce,
which he did not obtain. So the
husband, who had sold his wife,
was himself sold. And “sarve him

The GERMAN EMPEROR. The pen with which he wrote his sermons;
the pencil with which he drew his cartoons; the Manual of Harmony
and Counterpoint, and the Rhyming Dictionary, which assisted him
in the composition and writing of his song; his conductor's bâton,

A Lover of the Day, by ANNIE THOMAS (Mrs. PENDER CUDLIP), is
an exceedingly interesting, and well-written novel. The Promising
Pupil has had a real good time with it. He says that he considers
that the sketch of a suburban ménage, with which the story opens,
is capital, or, as latter-day critics would describe it, “thoroughly
convincing.” The studies of character are also of excellent quality.
It may be fairly acknowledged that all ends happily, for even the
reader will be satisfied. The book is well worth including in “the
library list,” and the Baron's Pupil congratulates the talented autho-
ress upon having added another item to the long list of her successes.

A (MISS) BROWN STUDY.
Miss Brown, who is a kind of niece to Charley's Aunt (her parents
are Pa BuchanAN and MAR-Lowe), is going º: at Terry's
Theatre. Apart from the amusing performance of the hero-heroine,
Mr. FRED KRRR, in the Kerr-acter of Miss Brown (this is a case in
which as the part couldn't be cut down to suit the actor, the actor
ought to have been cut down to suit the part), and of Mr. ARTHUR
PLAY FAIR as the somewhat
burlesquely dashing cavalry
officer Major O'Gallagher
(without a song l more's the
pity!), the piece would be well
worth seeing if only for the
capital make-up and the well-
sustained DAVID-JAMEs' like
performance of Mr. HERBERT
STANDING as Sergeant Tanner,
the detective; one of the best
bits of comedy to be seen just
now on the London stage. It
- - is broad without being vulgar:
and, except where the exigencies of farce are supposed to demand
some extravagance, it is natural. Mr. L. Power’s Irish Servant
is a capital sketch: always funny, never obtrusive.
..Very, good, too, is Miss EMILY CRoss as the proprietress of
Cicero, House.Academy; and Mr. GILBERT FARQUBAR as Hilbert-
son, the solicitor, gives us one of the best of his character sketches;
indeed, if he adopts what may be termed the “Hill-and-Blakely line,”
and sticks to it, he should be in great demand. Why did the authors
select the name of Miss Schwartz for the creole pupil at Cicero House
Academy? Was it that no better appellation could be found for this
dark young lady than the one invented by THACKERAY, namely “Miss
Swartz, the rich woolly-haired mulatto from St. Kitt's,” who fell
into “such a passion of tears” when Amelia left Miss Pinkerton's
academy The authors spell." Swartz” “Schwartz,” which, as
will, be clear to any unprejudiced mind, makes all the difference
in the world, and releases them from any obligation to the author of
Wanity Fair, Miss Schwartz is cleyerly played by Miss ADELA
MEASOR, and her fury with a dagger hair-pin is something terrible
to witness. Here's your health Miss Brown, a merry Christmas and
prosperity generally.

SHAKSPEARE WITHOUT THE MUSICAL, GLASSES.
DEAB MR. PUNCH,-No doubt you have seen that The Comedy of
Errors has been performed at Gray's Inn under somewhat similar con-
ditions to those that existed three centuries, ago. In 1594, the
members of the hon. society, having none of their body, capable of
undertaking the task of producing a “revell,” called in the strolling
players to their assistance, and gave, amidst some confusion, SHAK-
SPEARE's comedy. Remembering as I do the great success of The
Maake of Flowers in 1887, I cannot believe that the hon. society
has lost the power of finding members of the Bar able to play The
%; of Errors as well as any one else. I feel convinced that
“the Master of the Revels” of that and this period, would agree
with me. Still, the piece as given last week was worthy of note on
account. of the absence of scenic accessories and scenic divisions.
Were Sir HENRY to adopt the plan, I feel sure he would save many
thousands of pounds behind the footlights—whether he would not
lose as many more before the curtain is a matter that can only be
discussed after the project has been practically tested. To give an
opportunity of bringing the matter to an issue, I set down Becket as
it might be played on the novel principle.
SCENE.-The Green Curtain.
Enter HENRY THE SEconD and BECKET, followed by ELEANoF.
Henry. BECKET, you shall be an Archbishop.
Becket. Thanks, my friend, but I prefer to be Chancellor. If you
make me an Archbishop, we shall quarrel.

Now, the above is not only concise, but fairly intelligible, and, if
we are to believe the modern authorities, this was the kind of thing
that the Bard of Avon provided for his admirers. Whether he
would have done so in our times, had Sir HENRY IRVING accepted
one of his pieces, is quite another question, , As a good man of
business, Ifancy the greatest of our poets would have marched with
the times and produced something better.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
ONE of my Baronites reports that he has been reading Mr. WALTER
FRITH's novel In Search of Quiet, and can cordially recommend it
to those in search of a fresh and pleasant story with a distinctly
original literary flavour. It is a study of life and local society in a
Berkshire village, told in the form of a journal, with a quaint and
delicate humour, a curiously minute observation, and, as the story
developes, a power and pathos which should render it attractive.
Readers to whom Mr. FRITH is only known as the dramatist of Her
Advocate, will be agreeably surprised to find how successfully he has
resisted the temptation to “bring the odour of the footlights across
the hay,” to reverse Mr. PINERo's celebrated phrase.
A youthful, Baronitess informs me that Mr. ANDREw LANG has
written what he calls My Qwn Fairy Book, all new tales entirely out
of his own head! Quite a Pacha of Many Tales! The authoris much
indebted to certain chronicles of Pantonglia for a true and authentic
account of Prigio's adventures, and the annals of Scotland provided
him with the historical detailsof the “Kerof Fairnilee" and the “Queen
of Faery.” His tales are jº. adorned by GoRDON BRowNE,
T. Scott, and E. A. LEMANN, and §. lished by ARRowsMITH.

ULYSSES AT TAPLOW.
(A Song of Thames-Sirens.)
[“Mr. W. H. GRENFELL, of Taplow Court, calls
attention in The Field to the unnecessary and
increasing use of foghorns, sirens, and whistles by
launches on the Upper Thames. It is suggested
that regulations should be made by the Thames
Conservators with a view to checking the nuisance.”
—Daily News.]
SINCE the nymphs are all fled from our Thames,
Which the . of prose now environs,
It seems the absurdest of shames
That their place should be taken by—sirens!
Such sirens, too ! Voices not sweet,
But husky, cacophonous, raucous;
Compared with their row what a treat
ere the songs of the “daughters of
Phorous”
To stop up his ear-holes with wax
Was the dodge of the downy Ulysses,
But that would not ward the attacks
Of these modern melodious misses.
Leucosia? Parthenope?. Pooh!
Tisiphone's tone, not Ligea's l
Kick 'em out, Mr. GRENFELL, Sir, do /
'Tis one of your noblest ideas.
Controlled by some launch-owning brute,
Whom nothing mere decency teaches,
Tº: horribly hoot and root-toot
about the delicious Thames reaches;
They shriek, and they groan, and they roar,
Up and down till they make your hair bristle.
The launch in all ways is a bore,
But heaven save us all from its whistle!
Ah! GRENFELL, you’ll gratitude gain
From all who reside by Our River,
Or love it, if you can restrain
The launch, and its victims deliver.
Do make Thames Conservators hear
Your voice through the siren-born shindy.
Their fog-horns and whistles sound drear
As : night when the weather is
windy.
We might be in the Brocken with Faust,
Instead of our well-loved Thames Walley.
Success to you, Sir, in your joust
With red-tape and prolonged shilly-shally!
Against the launch-demon show sport,
Come down on these sirens a thumper,
And, GRENFELL of fair Taplow Court,
e'll drink your good health in a bumper!
MAGNIFICENT—AND WAR
(IF NECESSARY).
THE Channel Fleet, has, within the past
few days, been strengthened by the addition
of the Magnifican and the Majestic, two of
the nine big battle-ships planned and pro-
vided for whilst Lord SPENCER was still at
the Admiralty. “The modern Muses,” Lord
SPENCER calls them. Sir UGHTRED KAY-
SHUTTLEwoRTH was also there, and Sir
WILFRID LAwson says it was after him—
or rather in view of his personality—that
the ships were thus superbly named. On the
Magnificent, cheerful “CHARLIE * BEREs-
FoRD, in his official º at Chatham
Dockyard, has bestowed the thought and
labour of ãº: What can be done by
the unremit activity of an enthusiastic
man of business is shown in the absolute
perfection of the condition of the Magnificent

WALTER KERR hoisted his flag, and the crew,
eight, hundred officers and men all told,
gaily tripped aboard. A place for everything,
and everything in its place. Decks so spot-
less that the Admiral might, if he felt dis-
sed, have eaten his dinner off the bare
§. Upon the smallest detail, as on the
largest gun-from JoHN PENN's giant-
powered engines to the neat coil of spare
rope—infinite solicitude had been bestowed.
An imposing design loyally worked out.
C'est magnifique, mais ce n'est pas la guerre,
said the French general, watching the charge
at Balaclava. Our Magnificentis war if need
be. But the rapidity and certainty with
which so terrible an engine has been turned
out of the dockyard may, fully considered,
be regarded as working for peace. The
ship's motto will therefore be, C'est Mag-
nifique, et c'est la pair.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI,
ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
ON DIARIEs.
IN a recent number of the Spectator I saw with some amusementa
notice of the celebrated Diaries of Messrs. LETTs and Messrs. DE LA
RUE under the heading of “Current Literature.”... Now, a diary,
when the entries have been made in it, may conceivably beliterature;
but I must confess that it would not have occurred to me so to
describe the blank book which is to receive the daily, thoughts
of its purchaser. I should as soon expect to find a description
of frames under “Pictures of the Day.” Who knows henceforth
what curious items of intelligence we may not find under “True
Stories of Dogs”?
It must be understood, of course, that in saying this I have not
the remotest intention to disparage the productions of Messrs. LETTs,
... I know perfectly well, on the contrary,
that they supply admirably a º:
want, and no action can possibly be
more praiseworthy and honourablethan
that. All I wish to do is to register a
humble protest against the conduct of
the Spectator in thus wronging litera-
ture in order to avoid the trouble of an
extra heading. If any one else had
done it, one might not have objected
so strongly; but, coming from the
Spectator, the shock was painful. To
me, indeed, there had always been
something episcopal about that excel-
lent journal. If I personified it, my
mind conceived a being in lawn sleeves
and invested with a pastoral staff, a
sort of Gothic being steeped in the
solemn atmosphere of cathedrals, closes
and palaces. But if it continues thus
to juggle with the sacred word literature I shall have to degrade it
mentally to the level of an ordinary lay-preacher.
To return, however, to the subject of diaries. I can speak with
some impartiality on it, for, in spite of the most heroic efforts, Ihave
never succeeded in keeping one for much more than a week at a time,
and that was many years ago, in the remote days of my boyhood.
Why the .# of diaries and accounts by their rude, unlettered
offspring should give pleasure to parents, I know not; but there are
few sons, I am certain, who have not at some time been urged by a
father or a mother to make a daily record of their actions, or to
tabulate the expenditure of their scanty doles of pocket-money.
With girls there is no need for pressure. They rarely keep accounts,
it is true; but they all take to diaries as naturally as ducks to the
water.
In the matter of accounts, I was firm, and wisely so. How could
it have profited me to write, or my parents to read, the m notonous
record of my expenses? On two shillings a week (which was, I
think, my weekly allowance at that time) you can buy quite a
respectable number of jam-tarts, and occasionally you may make a
little excursion into the region of ices, or plum cake, or chocolate
creams. But I felt, and still feel, that it would have shown a
strange lack of judgment on my part if I had set these invariable
items down every week, even though they might have been tempered
now and then by the purchase of, let us say, a pocket knife, a pot of
gum, a bullet mould, or a catapult. Consequently, I never kept
accounts, and I fear I never shall.
BUT on the question of diaries I yielded. I came upon the
ancient record of my deeds only the other day. Here is the most
exciting entry:—“Got up early to fight FREDDIE with bollsters. It
was grand. We spoilt both bollsters, and broke the water-jug. It
driped through into Pa's dressing-room, Breakfast. Eggs again.
We have too many eggs, and not enough butter., Went out., Fought
FREDDIE in stable- ºrd, and beat him. He howled—I laughed.

played stingo, and got F.one on the leg with the fives-ball. Took Rover
out. No more to-day.” For ten days I persevered. Then, apparently,
the effort became too much, for the rest of my “current literature”
remains a blank.
YET again I made the attempt, but it was rot on my own behalf.
I had a friend who .# his diary with a religiºus care, and once,
once only, I wrote for him an entry, as I conce ved it might be—but
not, of course, in the sacred book itself. This was my version:—
“Travelled up from Northumberland. A dreadful jolting of the
train prevented sleep, and filled my mind with painful thoughts.
I found on my arrival at home that there were no letters for me.
Why is this?. Surely, surely she ought to have written. But, tush,
a manly spirit can best cure such ills. Sauntered into Piccadilly.
The street was full of unknown faces: strangers were in all the .#
known haunts. Oh, how terrible it is to be alone in this great city.
No matter, I must be brave. It would be worse than foolish to give
way. . In the evening. I shook the dust of London from my feet and
departed for Oxford.”
... I was afterwards permitted to read the actual entry. This is how
it ran: “Left Newcastle night mail. Dull day in London; lunch
at Phlegethon, dinner at Berkeley Restaurant. No one I knew:
good job. To Oxford by last train.” Nothing more prosaic can be
imagined: it just stated the facts sufficiently for reference, and
omitted all the sentimentalisms with which my imagination had
adorned the entry.
AND, after all, this is the secret of keeping a diary, if one who has
never properly * one may be permitted to give an opinion. Why
dº you keep it? Not, surely, to register the casual sentiments with
which, J. under the influence of a bottle of generous wine, you
embroider your daily life, but in order to state facts as they occurred
so concisely and clearly that, looking back in after years, you may
reconstruct the scene and live your life over again. It was for this
reason and for no other, as Robert Louis Stevenson has pointed out,
that the immortal Pepys wrote his diary. . He did not foresee publi-
cation. His cypher, he believed, guarded him from that. that
he cared for was that many years afterwards he should be able to
turn up his beloved diary, and remember by its aid exactly what he
did, in whose company, at such and such an hour of such and such a
day in his life... He loved himself, and all his little life, and wrote
its records for himself alone. And thus it comes that we, average
men and women of the latter end of the nineteenth century, delight
in the true picture of the life of an average man, in the account of
his weaknesses, his yanity, his achievements, his disappointments,
his jealousies, though the days of his activity were spent more than
two hundred years ago.
BUT, to me, Fºl. above all others, is one little book that I
9ssess, in which a friend had set down briefly the daily events of
is life and his engagements in advance. ... My memory goes back
with him to this dinner or that concert, and º we stay together
at this or the other country house. They are the barest entries, just
a record and nothing more, but my memory fills in the gaps and re-
acts the pleasant scenes. For October 26, the entry made in advance
is “JACK at Brindisi.” But before Jack reached Brindisi the hand
that wrote about him was stiff and cold, and the voice that would
have welcomed him on his return was silent for ever.
In the mind of every manywho has won his way to middle age there
is a quiet, sequestered nook peopled with the spirits of departed
friends, a verdant, peaceful recess, far removed from the stress and
turmoil of daily life. Thence in calm and peaceful moments he can
summon forth their shining faces, and be with them as once he used
to be. Time can add no line to their brows, they are always
beautiful, smiling, and affectionate, ºf and strong as they were
before the shadows closed round them, and they were lapped in alien
clay and laid below.
THE REAL EASTERN QUESTION.
Grand Chorus of all the Powers.
WE don't want to fight.
(Sung sotto voce.)
In all lingoes, if
we do,
We’ve massed the ships, we’ve massed
the men, we've massed the money too.
We’ve often fought before, we're con-
sistently untrue,
The question is, “Who'll have Constan-
tinople?”
The CoRNEY GRAIN MEMoRIAL.-Well
and wisely done, says Mr. Punch to the
Committee of the Corney Grain Memorial
Fund. They have decided to devote £600
to the establishment of a cot in the
Children's Hospital in Great Ormond
Street. The rest of the money is to be
- invested, and the annual interest will
form a nucleus for a Corney Grain Children's Christmas Toy Fund
in connection with the hospital. Thus, not only will the memory
of the genial and large-hearted entertainer be perpetuated, but
little sufferers will connect it year by year, as he himself would
have wished, with smiles and merriment and joy.

OPEN CONFESSION:
Or, The Rhymester's Revenge.
“RHYME me no rhymes!” the cynic says,
In accents stern and terse;
But I admit my early days
Were given up to verse.
Some say 'tis hard to be a bard,
I did not find it so.
Parnassus in one's own back-yard
Comes easy, don'tcherknow.
I'd stretch myself on couch or bed,
And like a blue-fly hum;
And gently rub my chin, or head,
And then the rhymes would come.
I cared not. in º: pride,
What subject fired my rhymes.
I think I could have versified
A copy of the Times.
Like one of those Impressionists
I thought all work was crude .
That was not whelmed in muddy mists,
Or could be understood.
And so I rhymed and rhymed away,
As seemed to be º;
And felt that I should be, some day,
A Poet Laureate!
Because, whatever theme might flit
Before me, hot-and-hot, -
I found I could spin rhymes on it
Much easier than not.
But somehow critics had a way,+
And it was very hard
Of calling me—why I can't say—
A—hang it!—“minor bard.”
They’d lump together five or six
Tootlers of tweedledee; -
And in that minor-minstrel-mix
They always mentioned Me!
Some of these minor bards were gay,
And some exceeding solemn;
But I was dragged in, any way,
Just to fill up the column.
Now minor critic ways, at times,
Will file the mildest folks;
And so I gave up making rhymes,
And took to making jokes.
It was not quite so easy, no!
A , bard, or scald,
May have a lot of hair, but 0,
Your jester's always bald !
'Twas not enough to rub my head,
I had to tear and scratch it.
Only six hairs, and they are red,
To-day remain to thatch it.
And now those critics say, at times
I rise to a poor pun;
But that, as minor were my rhymes,
So minus is my
De minimis non curat lear !
No, nor the critics eitherl
But now, their cynic souls to vex,
I rhyme and joke together."
And now they swear—their cheek sublime
A saint might well provokel—
That while my jokings may be rhyme,
My rhymings are no joke!

till tasted, most effectually conceals its dry
quality is, of course, Heid-sieck, and that
which keeps its manufacturing secret best is

“Oh, the usual subjects.” said the Ordinary Man. “Let’s begin
with the police-courts. We mostly get a paragraph or two out of
them. There’s always JANE CAKEBREAD, you know, if other subjects
fail. We haven't discussed her more than twenty times already.”
“I object,” said the Poet, firmly. “It’s all very well for you.
The Journalist studies this kind of thing professionally, the Emi-
nent Person always shows a keen interest in pickpockets, and the Mere
Boy can make bad puns on any subject; but where do I come in P
Let us choose a topic which will allow me to introduce a few verses—
not necessarily for publication, but as a guarantee of good faith.”
“Certainly not,” said the Journalist; “the editorial waste-paper
baskets are full enough already. No, we'll give our attention to
politics., Take the Turkish question, for instance. To begin with a
strikingly original remark, let me say that the SULTAN's position is
one of some difficulty. To judge by the telegrams—”
“Would be absurd,” put, in the Ordinary Man, “They are
written by Journalists, and all Journalists are liars. You, I believe,
are a Journalist.”
“For myself,” observed the Eminent Person, thºughtfully, “I
think we *:::: choose a less º: subject. Perhaps—'
“Hush, please,” interrupted the Mere Boy. “It’s quite time I
made a jºke. I always do at the end of a paragraph. Are you
ready? Turkey is always seasonable about Christmas." Thank you.
Next paragraph, please.”

: Is the door locked” asked the Ordinary Man.
"No,” said the Poet, with some surprise, “why?”
The Ordinary Man rose from his chair, walked across the room,
locked the door, stuffed a piece of paper into the keyhole, and returned.
“Because I want a little quite private conversation with the rest of
you. One of you is a nuisance, and the other three are frauds !”
“Jehoshaphat!” said the Mere Boy. -
“You,” said the Ordinary Man, looking at him severely, “are the
mere nuisance. You make idiotic remarks and atrocious puns. You
were amusing once, but we’ve had enough of you long ago, and the
sooner you clear out of the talking-room the better; You other three
are frauds-bad frauds., You all talk exactly alike. Mr. Eminent
Person, I should be glad to know in what your eminence consists.
Your verses, my Poet, are simply beneath contempt., And you,
Mr. Journalist, reel off platitudes exactly like the Poet or the
Eminent Person, except when you happen to be understudying the
Mere Boy., I am sick of the lot of you !”... . . .
“Indeed,” cried the Eminent Persºn, with infinite sarcasm; “and
how about your own twaddle, please?” .. -
The Ordinary man, waved a deprecating hand. ... "Oh, that is
another matter, . I only profess to be the Ordinary Man, and I talk
like one. Whether it is worth while to print every week the most
ordinary remarks of a very ordinary man is, of course, a matter of
opinion. But as for you, you contemptible dummies-–".
A heavy volume of verse flung by the Poet caught him in the eye.
It was the signal for a general scrimmage., Half-an-hour later five
men, badly wounded and beaten black and white, might have been
seen descending the staircase in silence. They were not on speaking-
terms for seven days. Only the Mere Boy, from the force of habit,
attempted a final remark to round off the column for that week.
“A Painful Scene,” muttered the Mere Boy.
THE END OF THE NEW WOMAN.—The crash has come at last.
While we have all been talking, and ºf: and writing,
Society, it seems, has been taking quiet, but deci action. The
statute rendering it a penal offence to be a New Woman was passed
through all its stages so secretly that no newspaper appears to have
had the least inkling of it. However, it is in force, and has been
acted upon, for in the Oxford Times, of December 7, we read that
“the Rev. C. KNIGHT NEwToN, chaplain at Oxford Castle, has been
promoted and transferred to the new women's Convict Prison at
Aylesbury.”

BROWNING AT BROWNING HALL;
Or, Love amongst the (Human) Ruins.
. MR. Asquith took part, on November 21, in the public inaugura-
tion of the, Robert Browning, Social Settlement, York, Street,
Walworth Road, a district with more than 115,000 inhabitants,
mostly poor, to the square mile. The hall where the meeting was
held, known of old as Lock's Fields Meeting House (built in 1790),
was once a Congregational chapel in what was long a well-to-do
neighbourhocd, and was attended by RoRERT BRowNING's family
the poet, himself having been baptised there. Mr. Asquith weli
described the business as “an attempt to grapple with some of the
most pressing, and at the same time intractable of the social problems
of metropolitan life, by planting in the very heart of districts whose
necessities were greatest colonies or settlements of educated men and
women.”
Shade of the Author of “Sordello” sings:—
Can the poet, memory-warmed, do aught but smile
On that mile
Of poverty's scanty pastures, where toil's sheep
Herd and creep,
That square mile of clustering tenement, coster-crop,
And small ºf
'Twas the home once of the well-to-do and gay,
(So they say,)
But the sordid misery settled on it since
Makes me wince,
Choky court, o'er crowded labyrinth spreading far,
Toil and jar !
Now the square mile hardly boast a spindly tree,
As you see.
Slime and slop replace old verdure; offal fills
Gutter-rills,
Muck you scarce can give a name to shames the sun,
As they run.
Where the Cººl Chapel which I knew,
ell-to-do,
Stood, they now have got a building which they call
Browning Hall!
Whence at eve you hear the husky coster squalls
From their stalls.
Where a multitude of cits breathed joy thiſ woe,
Long ago,
Love of fellows pricks the hearts up of a few,
Brave and true,
To make a “Social Settlement,” called, I see,
After me!
It does me truer honour, I protest
. Than the quest -
Of my minor mystic meanings, cryptic, crude,
By the
Of “disciples 9. at meetings Browning-Clubbish
Talk such rubbish!
HERBERT STEAD, the worthy warden, plies the task, with
Aid from AsquitH;
It was tireless Canon BARNETT put in motion
This good notion,
Though some chaffed him, as the votaries of Pooh-Pooh
Always do.
Well!
For “respectables” to settle in such slums,
here toil hums, -
And to dwell amidst much dirt and noise and vice,
Is not “nice”;
And Walworth is no Eden (with such smells),
For bland swells!
But here Culture, in the spirit of true neighbcu",
- Lives with Labour; -
And with wisdom, love, and unsectarian piety,
Lends variety - -
To that gloom which for poor workers and their wives
Spoils their lives.
There are lectures, classes, clubs, “larks” not a few,
Outings too!
In- and out-door recreation they all share,
For their care
Is to “chum-in” with poor folk in grief or joy,"
Girl and boy!
Well, a Walworth chap may not quite grasp Sordello,
Poor, good, fellow !
But the author of Sordello hath the whim
To grasp him :
And for Hall .#Settlement to bear his name,
He holds fame!
With this Robert Browning Social Settlement
I’m content.
Over wººl folly, noise and sin,
ay they win.
As I sang, despite wit, wealth, fame, and the rest,
“Love is best!”"
* Last line of BRowNING's “Love among the Ruins.”
Good OLD TIMEs REVIVED, AND A SUGGESTION.-Years ago. The
Finding of the Body of HAhold used to be considered the subject
ar excellence to be tackled by all aspirants for Royal Academical
onours. Now it is “ The Finding of Moses” which has procured
a gold medal and travelling studentship of £200 for HARRY RoRººt
MILCHAM. The fact of this picture having won the first prize at the
hands of Sir FREDERic LEighton, P.R.A., whom Mr. Punch
welcomes back again, as perfectly restored as a Wandyck at an
exhibition of Old Masters, -should suggest to the successful young
artist a companion subject in “The Fºnding of the Jury.”
STARTLING!—The Marquis of LoRNE has been taken, up by A
Constable, that is, his Lordship, as an Author, has been taken up by
Messrs. A. Constable & Co., who have published the Markis's book
From Shadow to Sunlight.

JOTTINGS AND TITTLINGS.
(By BABoo HURRY BUNGsHo JABBERJEE, B.A.)
No, I.
WHEN I first received intimation from the supernal and spanking
hand of Hon'ble Mr. Punch, that he smiled with fatherly benignity
at my humble request that he should offer myself as a regular
poorly-paid contributor, I blessed my stars and was as if to jump over
the moon for jubilation and sprightfulness.
But, heigh-ho! surgit amari aliquid, and his condescending
patronage was dolefully alloyed with the inevitable dash of bitters
which, as Poet SHAksPEARE remarks, withers the galled jade until
it winces. For with an iron heel has Hon’ble Mr. P. declined
sundry essays of enormous length and importance, composed in
Addisonian, Johnsonian, and Gibbonian phraseology on assorted
topics, such as “Love,” “Civilization,” “Matrimony,” “Supersti-
tion,” “Is Courage a Wirtue, or Vice Verºſi 2" and has recom-
mended me instead to devote my pen to
quite ephemeral and fugacious topics,
and merely commit to paper such reflec-
tions, critical opinions, and experiences
as may turn up in the potluck of my
daily career.
..What wonder that on reading such a
82ne # non and ultimatum my vor
faucibus has it and stuck in my gizzard
with bashful sheepishness, for how to
convulse the Thames and set it on fire
and all agog with amazement at the
humdrum incidents of so very ordinary
an existence as mine, which is spent in
the diligent study of Roman, Common,
International, and Canonical Law from
morn to dewy eve in the lecture-hall or
the library of my inn, and, as soon as
the shades of night are falling fast, in

However, being above all things de-
sirous not to let slip the golden oppor-
tunity and pocket the sinews of war. I
decided to let my diffidence go to the
wall and boldly record every jot and
tittle, however humdrum, with the criti-
reflections and censorious observa-
tions arising therefrom, remembering
that, though the fabulous and moun-
At which, stung to the quick at so unprovoked, and unpre-
meditated an affront, I accºsted him, severely through the bars of the
wicket, demanding sarcastically, “Is this your boasted British
Jurisprudence?” -
The savage heart of the Collector was moved by my expostulation,
and he consented to º the gate, and imprint a perforated hole on
my ticket; but, alack! his repentance was a day after the fair, for
the train had already taken its hook into the Cimmerian 5. of a
tunnel. When the next train arrived, I, waiting prudently until it
was quiescent, stepped into a compartment, wherein I was dismayed
and terrified to find myself alone with an individual and two lively
young terriers, which barked minaciously at my legs.
But I, with much presence of mind, protruded my head from the
window, vociferating to those *P* the platform, “Let out! Let
out ! I Fighting dogs are here !!!”
And º met my appeal with unmannerly jeerings, until the con-
troller of the train, seeing that I was firm in upholding my dignity of
British subject, and claiming my just rights, unfastened the door,
and permitted me to escape; but, while
I was yet in search of a compartment
where no canine elements were in the
manger, the train was once more in
motion, and I, being no daredevil to
take such leap into the dark, was a
second time left behind, and a loser of
two trains. Moreover, though I have
written a humbly indignant petition to
the Hon’ble Directors of the Company,
pointing out loss of time and incon-
venience, through incivility, and asking
for small pecuniary, compensation, they
have assumed the rhinoceros hide, and
nilled my request with dry eyes.
But I shall next make the further
complaint that, even when making every
effort to do the civil, the result is apt
to kill with kindness; and—as King
CHARLEs THE FIRST, when they were
shuffling off his mortal coil, , politely
apologised for the unconscionable time
that his head took to decapitate—so I,
too, must draw attention to the fact
that the duration of formal, ceremonious
visits, is far too protracted and long
drawn out. -
Crede experto. A, certain . young
English gentleman, dwelling in the
Temple, whose acquaintance I have
formed, earnestly requested that I
tain-engendered mouse was no doubt at
should do him the honour of a visit;
the time considered but a fiasco and flash
and recently, wishing to be hail fellow
well met, I presented myself before him
in the pan by its maternal progenitor,
nevertheless that same .# nuouse
rendered yeomanry services at a subse-
quent period to the lion involved in the
tºpromians intricacies of a landing-

Benevolent reader, dete fabula narra-
tur. Perchance the mousey bantlings of
my insignificant brain may nibble away
the cords of prejudice and exclusiveness
now encircling many highly respectable British lions. Be not angry
with metherefore, if in the character of a cursed but good-natured
friend, Iventure on occasions to “hint dislike and hesitate disgust.”
The majestic and magnificent matron, under whose aegis I reside
for rs. 20 per week, is of lofty lineage, though fallen from that high
estate into the peck of troubles, and compelled (owing to highly
social ãº to receive a number of small and select boarders.
Like Jepthah, in the play of Hamlet, she has one fair daughter
and no more, a bewitching and well-proportioned damsel, as fine as a
fivepence or a May-day queen. Notwithstanding this, when I
summon up my courage to address, her, she receives my laborious
politeness with a cachinnation like that of a Cheshire cheese, which
strikes me all of a heap. Her female parent excuses to me, such
flabbergasting demeanour, on the plea that her daughter is afflicted
with great shyness and maidenly modesty, but, on perceiving that
she can be skittish and genial in the company of other masculines, I
am forced to attribute her contumeliousness to the circumstance that
I am native gentleman of a dark complexion.
In addition, I have the honour to inform you of further specimens
of this inurbanity and bearishness from officials who are perfect
strangers to the writer. Each morning I journey through the
subterranean bowels of the earth, to the Temple, and on a recent
occasion, when I was descending the stairs in hº to pop into the
train, lo, and, behold, just as I reached the gate, it was shut in my
nose by the churlishness of the jack-in-office!
* Let out!

He greeted me with effusion, shaking
me warmly by the hand, and begging
me to be seated, and ºf many
inquiries, whether I preferred India to
England, and what progress I was
#. in my studies, &c., and so forth,
py all of which I answered faithfully, to
Let out !! the best of my abilities, -
After that he addressed me by fits and starts and longo interrallo,
et displaying so manifest and absorbent a delight in my society that
#. could not bring himself to terminate the audience, while I was to
conceal my immense wearisomeness and the ardent desire I had con-
ceived to leave him. - -
And thus he detained me there hour after hour, until five minutes
past one P.M., when he recollected, with many professions of chagrin,
that he had an appointment to take his tiffin, and dismissed me,
inviting me cordially to come again.
If, however, it is expected of me that I can devote three hours and
a half to ceremonial civilities, I must respectfully answer with a
Nolo episcopari, for my time is more precious than rubies, and so I
will beg not only Mr. HoneyBALL, Esq., Barrister-at-law, but all
other Anglo-Saxon friends and their families, to accept this as a
verbum sap, and wink to a blind horse.

To begin with, I must make an apology.
In my character of autobiographer I
apologise to him who (seeing how illus-
trious and important a man I am) would
have been deputed, or would have deputed
himself, to write—after my dissolution—
the record of my life. I" spoof” him—to
use a latter-day term—by setting downinan

I beg his pardon for this act of spoofery.

niarily, from the recorded events of a
career more or less-I know more–dis-
tinguished, coram publico, let that profit
“say I” fall into his hands whose few
years' course of usefulness may be thought
worthy of recapitulation.
I consider the events of my past years
sufficiently important. My would-be bio-
grapher, I am told, is of opiniºn that there
is in my career matter sufficiently in-
teresting to be handed down to posterity.
I therefore sit down to write my own bio-
graphy myself. I am extremely sorry for

vice of the immortal Scotchman, SAMUEL
SMILEs, I help myself to myself, and rejoice

that, after the completion of this volume,
there will be nothing more to be said on
the subject. That, in once, settles the bio-
grapher. There is nothing more harrowing
to a respectable Shade than the idea that
some corporeal, nonentity is writing, or
| about to write, a six-shilling post-
mortem (!) dissertation upon his embodied
existence.
My life has been an arduous one, and
though, as I have reason to believe, no one
has ever had occasion “to write me down
an ass,” I have excellentreasons for think-
ing that this volume will be generally found
bound in calf.
In the following chapters I have taken
pains to deal with incidents in my life

Q. Do you not think that a family gathering is
delightful?
A. Only from a humorous point of view. It is
certainly grimly amusing to see relatives who meet
but once a year at loggerheads. -
Q. But is a quarrel inevitable when kinsman

"STUDIES IN MODERN JOURNALISM.
No. II.-AT THE SIGN OF THE SNIP.
To return once more to a very interesting
topic. I picked up at a second-hand book-
stall the other day a curious little tempe-
rance tract, by a M. FUMISTE, of Paris.
Now he asserts in it that JEANNE D'ARc
was a rabid teetotaller, and that she made
all her followers wear blue ribbons, a theory
which is of the utmost importance. But
can we believe it? One must remember
that almost all the great warriors used to
drink-wisely, of course, and not too well
—before battle. Thus did Acmilies and
MICKY FREE, and the celebrated Aztec
general, Asº FMPAToh L – they all “took
their whack,” like Mr. HARRY FokER, and
why not the soldiers of LA PUCELLEP There
is plenty of hard drinking, too, in the Sagas.
Anyhow, M. FUMISTE's argument hardly
seems convincing. Then he attempts to
prove that the Maid liked her eggs hard
boiled. Well, that is too big a question for
me to go into now, but I hope to say a little
about it in my next six monthly instalments.
Now let us talk a little about the dear
spooks... Here is an interesting and well-
authenticated story of second sight. Mrs.
A., a widow living in Devonshire, fell
asleepin her chair one morning, and dreamed
that she saw her son, B., who was in
London at the time, fall into the Serpen-
time. Directly she awoke she jotted down
the hour (1.15 P.M.), and told her dream to
the other members of her household. Now
comes the strange part of the story. At
that ..". moment, as it afterwards proved,
B. had been eating º: in a Fleet
Street restaurant. The association of ideas
peculiar, to the sub-conscious self is thus
strikingly illustrated, and the whole story
is a very remarkable one.
IF one may praise a book which has re-
freshed a reader weary with the ordinary
novel, let me recommend you to read Usque-
bagh, the Red Indian. It is only nine
hundred pages long, and there are, full
descriptions of three battles in the first five
chapters, in which about five hundred people
are killed. The whole volume reeks of gore,
and the accounts of the scalping are bravely
done. This is, indeed, the true Romance,
and what a pleasant change from the New
Pathos, and the New Humour !
SºMEBOP has been sending, mº ſeries
again, and I wish they wouldn’t; I l".
mislay the stupid things; and then the
authors—genus irritabile'—are vexed. And
these aren't even good verses; they are not
about Prince CHARLIE, or salmon-fishing,
or golf; the only subjects worth a cent, as
Mr. W. D. HoweLLs would say. In fact,
they are so bad, that I prefer to give some
of my own instead.

[DECEMBER 28, 1895,
PHIL AND JERRY ABOUT TOWN.
AT "LE Box.E.”
By the device of plastering his hair straight down over his fore-
head, PHII, succeeds in investing himself with a certain meretricious
respectability. He says he has been taken for a monk, but that must
have been in the dusk. JERRY has a profound respect for PHIL, who,
he believes, knows London Life with a minuteness equalled by few
“I’ll, show you round some night,” PHIL had often said to his
friend, but had not descended to particulars. ... Now he had pro-
posed to begin with what he called a visit to “a glove establish-
ment.” . When he explained that this meant a boxing match, JERRY
felt a cold chill in the neighbourhood of his spine.
“Do they hurt each other?” he inquired.
“Not much,” said PHIL. “There's a knock out occasionally, you
know, but you'll soon get used to that.”
JERRY had often heard of “knock outs” at mock auctions, and
though he did not clearly see the connection, it was all part of
London Life. The evening opened under the
best auspices. They dined at JERRY's club,
É. the most respectable in London. At
the table next to theirs sat a bishop.“eating
soup like an ordinary man,” as PHIL re-
marked., JERRY reflected with pride that
PHIL didn't know everything. Evidently he
expected there was a well-defined episoopal
fashion of eating soup, JERRY was con-
scious of a certain criminal elation foreign
to his breast. “If he only knew where we
are going after dinner!” he murmured.
, Incidentally PHIL mentioned that, when
dining alone in his den, he usually drank
his wine out of a skull.
“Do you ever,” asked JERRY, with vague
recollections of doings at Newstead Abbey in
Lord BYRON's time, “drink blood out of it?”
“Sometimes,” said PHIL boldly.
When PHIL and JERRY reached the Temple
of the Noble Art they found it crowded to the
outer ring of chairs and benches. Most of
the spectators were in evening dress... Every
one was smoking. JERRY at first thought
they had tumbled into a fog. Looking down
from the gallery he made out a square plat-
form, covered with, white, cloth, and roped
in. It was a j. night in the sporting
world. A Fº ar manager was taking his
benefit, and the Fancy flocked round him.
“You’re in luck,” said PHIL, “It isn't
often you might drop in and find such a
galaxy of talent. You’ll see PETER JAckson,
champion of the world; Dick BURGE, light-
weight champion of the world; JEM MACE
echoes of whose name may have rippied
round your desk at school; BILLY PLIMMER,
bantam-weight champion of the world;
JERRY DRISCOLL, champion of the navy;
and, FRANK CRAIG, the Coffee Cooler, for a
while the middle-weight champion. These
only a few...But if you feel inclined to do
anything, I’ll get you up a list, out of which you're sure to be suited.”
Two men, ducking under ropes, presented themselves on platform.
Stripped to the waist, with black tights, displaying legs all muscle,
With them, a comfortably stout gentleman in evening dress, who
introduced them by name. He mentioned with pride that one of the
twain sign articles to-morrow for a fight with George Dixon.
§: The two men in black tights, and nothing else, walked
igently round each other; , Now and then they met in fierce fray.
ext to JERRY.sat a mild-looking gentleman in evening clothes,
who took an intelligent interest in the episodes.
... You watch,” he said, to no one particular, “how BILL's straight
left #. its way * *. mug.”
1me '' Was Called. e two men suddenly sto unlacin
arms from about, each others necks, *::::#1; *:::: in fon
embrace. Retired to opposite corners of platform. Sat down on
three-legged, stools...To either came a man dressed in white calico,
suggestive of confectioner out of work. Brought with him a towel.
...; it with either hand on a corner he waved it before the seated
gladiator.
“What does he do that for P” JERRY asked.
“To drive away the flies,” said PHIL.
JERRY thought that precaution was effectually taken whilst the two
inen were thumping each other, . But these people knew their own
business. “ToMMY ORANGE and JIM Bhock” were next announced;
evidently old acquaintances.
“The Coffee Cooler is out to enjoy himself.” put
“ToMMY's getting too old for this work,” said a gentleman on
other side of the mild-visaged man in white necktie. -
“Yes,” that authority remarked; “ToMMy's been trotting round
for some years. Out of condition, too; carries quite a little tub.
But I expect you wouldn't care to be standing up before him,” .
JERRY would have liked to ask why this veteran professional
should carry a little tub. Probably stored cold tea, or other light
refreshment in it. JERRY could not see any sign of it; concluded
ToMMY had left the tub outside. - -
“Mr. HoRACE KING,” said the Master of the Ceremonies, intro-
ducing the heavy-weight amateur champion of the '94 brand, “and
FRANK CRAIG.” - - -
This nice distinction in the use and omission of the Mr. indicated
the amateur and the professional. FRANK CRAIG is a gentleman of
colour, known to a section of the civilised world as the Coffee Cooler.
At cry of “Time!” he advanced from corner and walked round the
amateur with springy step, his white teeth shining in ecstatic smile.
However it may be with others, the Coffee Cooler is out to enjoy
himself. His walk is a dance; his sparring rhythmical. Jºkay
expected every moment to see him produce
a banjo and hear him break forth in song
from the far off plantation. -- - -
“Instead of which,” as the mild-visagéd
gentleman said, “he got on with a right-
handed punch in the jaw.”
When the round was over, and the men
retired to their respective corners, JERRYob-
served that whilst the cloth was brought into
diligent use, waving about the face and chest
of the amateur, no approaches were made in
that direction towards the Coffee Cooler.
“Why is that?” asked JERRY, thirsting
for information.
“Well,” said PHIL, “you see, he's black.
The flies don't show on him, so what's the
use.
ALECK ROBERTS and PAT CoNDON –
“PATTY,” the mild-visaged gentleman calls
him, as if he were a singer—had a set-to:
A patter of blows rang through the crowded
arena, like a thunderstorm falling on forest
leaves; “only more so,” JERRY added.
When it was over, both men shook hands
affectionately, had the flies driven away,
and walked off as if they had been merely
conversing on the state of the weather.
Item: An eight-round fight between two
soldiers, one a drummer in the Grenadier
Guards, the other a corporal in the Hussars.
Both splendiá specimens of manhood. Natu-
rally the drummer beat, the corporal being
knocked out in third round. At this stage a
touch of pathos was judiciously introduced
on scene verging on the severe. The M.C. led
on to the platform PEDLARPALMER and BILLY
PLIMMER, who were down for a round or so.

But the PEDLAR, alack l had his ear en-
vironed with cotton wool, evidence of an
accident in Sootland, while PLIMMER had
his shoulder out. The two were in
morning dress, and looked very * as
the strange coincidence of misadventure, was explained. It was
jº but the audience generously cheered, and, ducking
their heads, the damaged athletes withdrew. - -
Spirits, temporarily depressed, were raised to highest pitch by ap-
earance of those old favourites JEM SMITH and DICK BURGF.

remarked, was “usually there or thereabouts.” But before he drew

paid a return visit. “If Dick ever wants money, I'm behind him,”
said, the mild-visaged gentleman with exceptional emphasis. . . .
About this time, the hearts of the audience uplifted by this bit of
science, the wily, M.C. worked off another disappointment. PETER
| JAckson, Champion of the World, was down to do something. But
no one seemed to want a try with him. As he shuffled across the
stage, amid loud applause, you could almost see the blushes mantling
his coal-black countenance. So the Champion, who owns in the
Coffee Cooler a brother, walked across the platform to show he was
there if he were wanted. “Shall we have a round or two, PHIL,”
JERRY asked, as they walked out into the fresher air.
“I think not,” said PHIL. “Your blood is dangerously up.”
JERRY thought none the worse of his friend for this judicial
remark, based upon keen observation.

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
A CANINE ENGAGEMENT,
THE other day my brown spaniel, Rufus, approached me and
intimated in the usual manner that he wished to have a private
conversation with me. I may mention, by the way, that I have
now attached a Canine Cogitatograph to º dog in my pos-
session, and I have therefore no difficulty in discussing matters
with them and in registering their thoughts. Rufus's manner
of declaring his desire for conversation is peculiar. He raises
himself, on his hind legs, places his fore-paws on * knee,
throws his head back and glares at you with eyes that almost
bulge out of their sockets. He then scrapes at you with one of
his fore-paws, wags his tail (it is a mere stump, I regret to say),
and hurls himself forward until he has almost buried his head
in your lap.
I IMMEDIATELY requested all the other dogs to retire from the
room, and then addressed Rufus. “Well, Rufus, old man,” I
said, “what do you want?” -
“I want to talk to you particularly about a little matter,
*...Tºabout something I-the fact is, Iscarcely know how
to put it.
ere Rufus blushed. Of course you know how a dog blushes.
He º: bis eyes, then suddenly curls himself round and seizes
his tail in his teeth, as if entirely absorbed in the pursuit of a
legion of fleas. As I have said, Rufus's tail is short, and the
effort of blushing is therefore a very severe one for him. I
gently removed his head from his tail and encouraged him to
proceed. “Nobody can hear us, my dear boy; pull yourself
together, and tell me what is on your mind.” -
Hereupon Rufus sighed, looked round at the garden window
to see whether the St. Bernards were about, metaphoricall
cleared his throat, and made this astounding declaration. “
am in love with Nellie, and have asked her to be my wife.”
Now Nellie is a deerhound, a lady with a most aristocratic
head and deep brown, expressive eyes. I had noticed for some
time that RUFUs had been particularly attentive to her. He
had constituted himself her guardian, and had growled with
more than ordinary fury when any of the other dogs had º:
proached her. On one occasion she had abstracted from him a
remarkably succulent cutlet-bone, and he had suffered the
indignity without protest. All this I had noticed, but I confess
that it had not prepared me for Rufus's avowal.
“My dear Rufus,” I said, “this comes upon me rather
suddenly. Is there not a slight disparity in size and general ap-
pearance between you and Nellie º Your legs, for instance—”
“Legs!” said Rufus, disdainfully. “Is a dog to consider his
legs when his heart is involved? Besides,” he continued, “Nellie's
legs are quite long enough for both of us, and, after all, if Nellie has
§: lºnger legs, I have the keener nose, and that makes up for
em.
“WELL,” I said, “what did Nellie reply?”
“Nellie told me that she had no objection to me”—as he said this,
Rufus hung his head in a most affected manner—“that, in fact, she
rather liked me, and that she would consider herself engaged to me
if her dear master didn't object. She didn't know where her mother
was, and as for her father, she had never known him at all, so she
was unable to refer me to either of her parents.”
“But look here, Rufus,” I put in, “how do you propose to live?”
“I have thought of that,” he said: “There §P be room enough
for both of us to live quite comfortably in one of the kennels. I shall
settle upon her my collar, my chain, and a considerable store of
bones, which I have invested in a corner of the garden. Besides, I
intend to give her a life interest in my tail.”
... WELL, to cut a long matter short, Rufus was so eager, so press-
ing, so energetic, that I was forced at last to yield to his request.
I then called Nellie in, and communicated my decision to her, while
Rufus retired under the table, and blushed with great vigour. Nellie,
I am bound to say, showed no special enthusiasm in the matter, but
accepted the situation with a placid dignity all her own. I then ex-
tracted Rufus from beneath the table, joined their paws together,
and gave them my blessing. As it was now time for the morning
walk, I called the other dogs, Roy and Don, the two youthful
St. Bernards, and Ben, the retriever, and we all went out together.
IN some mysterious Yº. intelligence of an sº between
Rufus and Nellie must have been communicated to the others, for
they all frisked round the happy pair and barked their congratula-
tions: “Look here, you two,” said Ben to the St. Bernards; "we
had better get on ahead a bit and leave these two fools together.
They are sure to have a lot of things to say to one another. I have

been like that myself and know what it is.” So the three caperºd
on ahead leaving Rufus and Nellie at my heels. Their conversation
was so interesting that I here transcribe it.
“Darling Nellie,” said Rufus, in his most pathetic manner, “I
love you awfully. I am sure I love you much more than you
love me.”
“Nonsense, Rufus, you only say these things to annoy me. I love
you very, very much, really much more than you love me—there!”
“Oh, but what can you see in me to make you love me at all? I
am only a short, little, bandy-legged dog, and you are the most
beautiful being in the world. No, I'm sure H. on't love me more
than this,” and with that he pointed to the little extra claw on his
left fore-paw. - -
“Rufus,” said Nellie, with a certain amount of asperity; “if you
go on like this I really shall have to bite you. , You make me doubt
whether you love me even a teeny weeny little bit.”
“There, there, my own,” said Rufus, “I didn't mean to vex you.
But oh, shan’t we be happy?”
At this moment there was a tremendous scurry amongst the three
dogs who had gone on in front. They had seen a tabby cat at the
distance of one hundred yards, and were off, helter skelter, in pursuit.
The instinct of the chase asserted itself in the two lovers, and in a
moment they, too, had joined in the racket. The cat, I am glad to
say, escaped up a tree, but for the time all further love-making was

“THE MIssing LINK.”—At a meeting of the Berlin, Anthropof
logical Society last week, Dr. DuBois, of Leyden, exhibited and
lectured upon the fossil bones of what he contended had been an ape-
man, found in Java. But Professor WIRCHow argued that the skull
and bones were not those of an ape-man but “of a large gibbon.”
Surely this was going one better than Dr. DuBois, who only asserted
that the remains of the skeleton had once belonged to a mere ape-
man. But to have been connected with a “Gibbon,” was an honour
of which any admirer of the Decline and Fall, including Mr. BoFFIN,
might well be proud. These “Gibbon Bones” ought to be placed on
the shelves of a public library next to “BoHN's GIBBoN.”

WINTER CHEER.
A Secular Christmas Carol.
[“Winter Cheer,” the name of a crimson
Carnation.]
“CHRISTMAs comes but once a year,
And when it comes it brings good cheer.”
So runs the good old saying,
Drawn from the days men scarce remember,
When Britons danced in drear December
As lightly as when Maying.
The brave old folk! They loved their joke,
Nor, donkey-like, to Dullness' yoke,
Mere Issachars, went crouching.
They named their very flywers as though
They saw the sun above the snow,
Good hope and pluck avouching.
When “milk came frozen home in pail,”
They warmed their hearts with song and tale,
And cheered their souls with carol.
Cheeks reddened at the Christmas-rose,
Not like our pessimistic crows,
All “black as a tar-barrel.”
They did not “pull a kite” and sniff,
Or cock a cynic nose, as if
All love and fun were folly. . -
They plucked bright flowers in Summer's
prime,
Yet knew to cheer white Christmas-time
With mistletoe and holly.
And why not we? Let Mirth and Glee,_
Not Tweedledum and Tweedledee
In everlasting shindy, -
Be our companions for the hour; -
Though frosts may chill, or rains may show'r,
Or nights be wild and windy.
There's Winter cheer, for those who look,
In home, and child, and friend, and book,
Despite the dismal croakers.
Trouble returns, maybe, to-morrow,
To-day avaunt with brooding sorrow!
Hurrah for honest jokers!
To those who fret old griefs and whimson,
The old carnation flushed and crimson,
And named so patly, prettily,
Might teach a lesson good to learn
When boards are piled, and Yule-logs burr,
And girlish eyes gleam jettily.
When Christmas comes it brings good cheer!
But there are regions dim and drear
Which never know his coming. -
Where boards are bare and grates are void,
Whose very children ne'er enjoyed
The season's mirth and mumming.
What “Winter cheer” have such poor souls
In their foul slums and stuffy holes
Where sunrays are a rarity?
None, none l—unless the outcast band
Are succoured by the open hand
Of Christian Christmas Charityl
So Punch, whilst preaching pluck and mirth,
For generous goodwill on earth
An earnest prayer must mingle.
Since Christmas comes but once a year,
Let the poor share your Winter cheer!
A good old tag, though trite, yet clear,
To close his Christmasjingle!
The PROPHETIC SAGE OF FLEET STREET.-
At this particular moment Mr. Punch refers
his readers, which means everybody, every-
where, to his cartoon for November 2, where
to Master JoBRNY's question as to the mean-
ing of “The Monroe Doctrine,”. Master
JonATHAN answers, “Wa-al-guess it’s that
wº everywhere be-longs to U.S.”
Which “US” of course stands, as usual, for
the United States. . President CLEVELAND
has pointedly illustrated the illustration.

REQUEST OF AMOROUS ARCONAUT.
You always loved to be afloat
In skiff or in cance,
Or any other sort of boat
With only room for two,
To feather you would not be taught,
Did not know stroke from bow.
And what a lot of crabs you caught!
I wish you caught them now.
Can you recall the dreadful shock
. You caused when you would steer,
You meant to make for Molesey Lock
But went to Molesey Weir.
In agony you cried “Which string P”
Too late, as we upset.
I would that now to me you’d cling
As you did dripping wet.
On Boatrace Day you’d always don
The dark and azure blue,
So when the match was lost and won
You wore the victor's hue.
You asked, on Henley's classic stream,
What time the tide was low P
And why they didn't race by steam,
For rowing was so slow P
If #º years from hence
(I wish you no such fate),
You'll never know the difference
'Twixt four-oar and an eight;
But this perhaps you’ll comprehend,
I’ve house-boat room to spare,
And single sculling I will end
If you will make a pair.

At Christmas, time every woeful tale
ought to end with a tip.
“MARIA, THE BRUNETTE.”
(Framework of a Christmas Story, Old Style, but Topically up to Date.)
THE three city men, while they waited, exchanged experiences.
Their stories had been told before, but to a different audience. As
it happened, when each had his biography related by an expert, the
others had been away. ... But now they were together. They had not
much leisure for recollections. Every moment they expected the
attendant who was to “personally conduct” them on their tour.
Not that they would be long with him; they were soon to part
company. One was going after a week's delay to the south coast;
another to the extreme west; another to the bracing air of a northern
suburb of the metropolis.
They laughed as they recognised one another. They had met
before, but with different surroundings.
: How shall we pass the time?” asked one.
‘‘By following the precedent set by Charles DICKENs years ago
and telling one another stories,” was the prompt response; “and f
beg to move that our friend who has hitherto kept silence should
lead the way. Gentlemen, attention for a yarn.”
Thus encouraged, the third man commenced.
THE FIRST CITY MAN's STORY..—The Company Promoter.
. I had half-a-crown in my pocket, &c., &c. (for ten pages), and so,
in spite of all my toil and trouble, the Wooden Nutmegs Company
turned out a failure.
, “Dear me!” observed City Man Number One, “you had dis-
. hard luck. Well, I suppose we must considerſt the fortune
or War.
"Can you not tell us something about your own adventures?”
said the original speaker. “Ah, I see you have no objection.”
Thus invited, the man in the white hat commenced.
THE SECOND CITY MAN's StoRY.—The African Erplorer.
I had not been happy, at home, and was partial to a roving life.
I had quarrelled with all my relatives; so, securing eighteen pence
in copper (my entire capital), I commenced my wanderings. I went to
Africa, &c., &c. (for ten pages). Then when the official receiver
issued his report I found that the Far Above Rubies Gold Mine had
not been (to put it mildly) the safest of investments.
“We should think not,” said the others with a smile. “We should
think not.” - -
Time was now running short. And ºnly, in compliance
with his promise, the last merchant commenced.
THE THIRD CITY MAN's STORY..—The Stock-Erchange Jobber.
I had just fivepence. However, this carried me into the House.
I was not ambitious. I took a broom, and used it...This gradually,
&c. &c. (for ten pages), so the shares ran down like the mouse in
“Dickory Dock ’’’ The slump came, I went with it, and you see
me where you find me.
At this point the personal conductor entered.
... Here, you three,” he said roughly, “stir yourselves.”
... Where are we going?”
“To Holloway, in the first instance.” And without further fuss
he pushed the convicts into Black Maria.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
A CAPITAL book of “nonsense” verses and pictures, quite the best
thing of the kind since Mr. LEAR's illustrated rhymes, has been pro-
duced anonymously by “A Nobody,” and “ §§ published”
by GARDNER & Co. The Baron, at Christmas time, cannot do a
better turn to young and old friends than by ºf them,
one and all, to procure this book, which provides a store of lore, for
Christmas holidays. The Baron likewise advises them to add to their
p. The Adventures of Two Dutch Dolls, written by Miss
ERTHA UProN, and capitally illustrated by her sister, Miss
FLORENCE. “‘Doli sine ratione non possunt,”—which, being trans-
lated, means that these ‘Dolls (Doli) couldn't do what they do do
unless they had all their wits about 'em,’” quoth
THE LEARNED AND CHRISTMAssy BARON DE Book-WoRMS.

THE ROAST BEEF OF OLD ENGLAND.
(Some Seasonable Encore Stanzas dedicatei by Mr. Punch to the Duke of
Westminster.)
[The DUKE of WesTMINstER is reported to have presented Hogarth's
celebrated and patriotic masterpiece, “Calais Gate; or, the Roast Beef of
Old England,” to the National Gallery.]
WHEN mighty Roast Beef was the Englishman's food,
They painted some pictures the world allows good.
Now the Duke makes a gift, in munificent mood,
Of HogaRTH's “Roast Beef of Old England.”
Sing Oh! this old English Roast Beef l
The Roast Beef HARRY FIELDING and LovERIDGE praised,
Britons still have a love for, in days crank and crazed,
So Punch holds that a stave to our Duke should be raised,
Who gives Bull this “Roast Beef ºf Old England.”
Sing Oh! the old English Roast Beef!
If ever a true English painter we had,
It was WILLIAM HogahTH, free from freak and from fad,
So a true English Duke makes true }}}} hearts glad
With this timely “Roast Beef of Old England.”
Sing Hol the Duke's English Roast Beef!
PLAYING ON THE BEACH.
DEAR MR.PUNCH,-After selling my wife's trinkets to pay income-
tax, judge of my astonishment on reading this:–
In replying to the toast of “Her Majesty's Ministers,” the CHANCELLoR of
THE ExchequeR said he had only had a single representation asking for
remission ºf taxation.
The CHANCELLOR of THE ExchequER seems actually to be offended
because only one individual has asked, to have his money, back
Just to undeceive him, I may say that a cheque for £1 5s. 4d. (the
amount of my aforesaid income-tax) will be most welcome to
- ATTHEL ASTGASP.
P.S.-I look upon the income-tax this year as a “Hicks Beach-
'em pill” which all have to swallow.
WAN WINKLE ON THE MONROE DOCTRINE.
(A Sequel to the Hundred Years' Sleep.)
RIP awoke after a slumber of a hundred years. He was too weary
to talk, so he listened; There were two strange persons speaking
with an accent that he recognised of Devonian origin. In their
features, too, he recognised a trace of faces of Plymouth extraction.
He thought that some more excursionists had come over from
England to settle in the youngest of British colonies.
* I tell you what it is,” said the first of the two men, “we cannot
tolerate foreign interference.”
“That is so,” returned the other; “these Britishers must keep
#. ,distance. We are going to boss our own land, and that’s a
act.
“You are about right. The great American Continent belongs to
the great American People, and they claim their inheritance.”
“I say,” said RIP, sitting up and rubbing his eyes. “What are
you talking about? And as I have been asleep for a long while, tell
me first, how is King GroRGE”
“We know nothing about kings,” was the reply. “We are
citizens of the United States, and we are not going to stand any
foreign interference from Britishers.”
“Foreign interference l’exclaimed RIP. “What are you talking
about! Why, England was in America ages before your new-
fangled Republic. And how about Canada, and the British posses-
sions in the South º'
For RIP, although he had been asleep for a century, had managed
to keep his dreams decently up to date.
“We know nothing about history,” cried the citizens of the
U.S.A. “All we feel is that we ain't going to brook any foreign
interference.”
“What rot!” returned RIP. “Because Nephew (not Uncle) SAM
has declared himself independent of John BULL, that does not give
him a right to call all Transatlantic Britain his own. If Jon N were
to turn nasty and turn you all out, what would you do then?'"
“Well, I suppose we should have to go back home. After all,
England isn't such a bad place to live in.” -
But RIP was dissatisfied with the situation in spite of this
assurance. So he returned to his slumbers.
