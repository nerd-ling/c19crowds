A* the present Christmas—in this very season of Misletoe and Holly, 1846,-Punch offers to the whole Reading
Race of Man a most sufficing slice of Plum Pudding. Yes: touched by the benevolence of the season,
Punch will deny no man the bliss of a slice ; a slice that, well digested, shall impart to the partaker a warmth
of heart, and a certain comforting of the stomach; shall, moreover, incline him to think tenderly upon those
denied the happiness of any sort of mouthful.
For the past six months Punch—the fact is known wherever the sun shines—has been busy compounding
this mighty Pudding. Up early—down late—the marvellous work has been the sole possessing object of his
life. How has he not laboured to obtain the best ingredients' For, as the immortal Soyer profoundly observes:
“Some eggs are much larger than others; some pepper stronger; salt salter; and even some sugar sweeter.”
Therefore Punch, knowing that he was making a Pudding for the whole Human Race—(a very different thing, mind
you, from the Pudding that your dear MRs. CAUDLE, Sir, makes for you and all the little C.'s; though, may that
steam like a sweet sacrifice to all your nostrils, and sit lightly as butterfly upon rose-leaf on all your stomachs')
—Punch, knowing that this Pudding would be eaten by Tartars, Greenlanders, Russians, Chinese, Pennsylvanian
Bondsmen; nay, even by the poor Troglodytes in their cabin caves; Punch makes his Pudding of the strongest
and of the best, and of that most likely to keep.
There are certain wretches who, having made some wonderful discovery in a stew-pan, die with the secret.
Culinary misanthropes it is their pride to go out of the world, carrying the receipt locked up in their brain;
locked up for the worm to pick and feed upon. Now it is the pride—surely the pardonable pride—of Punch to
publish to the ends of the universe (and what can he publish that is not safely delivered there?) the ingredients of
his Christmas Plum Pudding. Here they are ; and let the reader, if he will, get the same articles, and make a
Pudding for himself. (Punch, by the way, feels quite safe in this little bit of liberality; for though folks might
obtain some, nay, all the ingredients, can they ever hope to arrive at Punch's inimitable way of mixing?)

iv PREFACE.
PUNCH'S PLUM PUDDING.
Eggs (Golden) from the bird, the property of Mother Goose ; with the Egg of a Phoenix—the only one
ever laid—taken from a nest of Cinnamon-sticks, and found in a Nutmeg Tree, in Arabia Felix.
Beat well in a crystal bowl with a spoon of satin-wood.
SUET from the Ten Thousand Prize Oxen fattened by order of Poor-Law Commissioners, for
Christmas Fare in all the Unions, Chop with the Sword of Justice.
Flour ground from wheat grown in every corner of the world, presented by CEREs, the Goddess of FreeTrade.
BRANDY, benignly winked at (“ on this occasion only”) by FATHER MATHEw.
LeMon PEEL from the Gardens of the Hesperides.
RAIsINs from Valencia, and packed in liquidated Spanish Bonds,
JAMAICA PEPPER freely contributed by free Negroes, (all grateful and enlightened readers of Punch.)
SALT sent to Punch by the East India Company, as a sample of the untaxed material henceforth to
be enjoyed by the Ryots of Hindostan.
CURRANTs (from Zante) the gift of King OTHo, and—to use his Majesty's own words—“as a small,
but sincere acknowledgment of the Constitutional Wisdom derived by him from the pages of Punch.”
Spices that will embalm wit and good humour for ages.
MILR—of HUMAN KINDNEss; get it where you can—and when got, make the most of it.
It has been said of a cake, you cannot eat it and have it. Now it is especially otherwise with
PUNCH's PLUM Pudding ; for, though always eating that, you always possess it: it fills you—warms you–
makes your blood dance merrily down to your toes (no slight advantage this at the present season), and is
never diminished. Devour every bit of it to-night, and you find it whole upon your shelf in the morning.
We have given the ingredients. Well, then, mix them No-no–no. None but Punch can do
this ; and in this happy season Punch will mock no man with impossible counsel. However, as none save
Punch can make this Pudding, so are there none so liberal with the blessing when compounded.
Witness his generosity. Here, you fellow, kicking your legs upon the wall of China—you Esqui-
maux, stop your rein-deer, and come out of your sledge—in a word, all the Human Race—every one of
you-TAKE A slice.
!

“THE TIMES.” ON TOM THUMB.
“Mr. PUNCH,
“MAY I beg your protection, your championship, against
the wicked attack of the Times. As a lady of quality—as one of the
superior classes—I ask it. In the Times of the 26th ult. there were—in
a leader, I think you call it—these abominable words : —
“‘The display of a disgusting dwarf attracted hordes of gaping idiots, who poured
into the yawning pockets of a Yankee showman a stream of wealth one tithe of which
would have redeemed an honourable English artist from wretchedness and death. It is
terrible to think, that in the London “season " of this century, in the heart of the
greatest city, and under the eyes of the wealthiest people in the world, such should
have been the lot of a gentleman who, if he wanted those pliant qualities which some-
times supersede both talent and merit in worldly success, had almost merit and talent
enough to compensate the deficiency, and failed in no other of the requisites for com-
petence and fame. These are the events which impel even sober-minded men towards
the conviction that this condition of society should no longer exist, whatever be the cost
of the change.”
“It is evident that the Times herein hints at a revolution of some
sort ; and I have immediately ordered all our doors and shutters to be
lined with shot-proof iron. But, Sir, to speak of ToM THUMB ; for it
is that interesting creature whom the Times so unfeelingly assails.
“I, Sir, have visited ToM THUMB's levees, I know not how many
times. In common with thousands of Englishwomen, I have kissed
and fondled that delicious little creature : but, Sir, I never flew in the
face of the world—that is, of my world; I waited, calmly waited, for
the authority of high precedent, before I rendered myself at the
Egyptian Hall. And I was rewarded for my prudence. -
“When Tom THUMB was sent for again and again to the palace ;
when he received articles of jewellery from the fair hand of the repre-
sentative of BRITANNIA herself—
“When the QUEEN DowAGER had a miniature watch expressly
made for him—
“When the DURE of WELLINGtoN (who is the appointed conscience-
keeper for all the nobility) condescended to visit him—
“What was I–what was the whole world to do 2 Why, Mr. Punch,
I, and thousands, rushed to the Egyptian Hall to dandle that sweetest,
prettiest specimen of the genus man. And for this, am I, Sir, to be
called “a gaping idiot' by the Times?
“Not, I trust, when I have made out the case I hare made ; when I
have shown that I only acted in obedience to the dictates of fashion—
of fashion, set by crowned queens and the noblest of the mobility.
“Awaiting, Sir, the apology of the Times,
“I remain,
“Your Old Correspondent and Constant Reader,
“GloBIANA WestEND.”
“P.S.—I suppose that now—although the dear little loves have
danced their native flings and reels at Buckingham Palace—there will
be a cruel onslaught upon the last arrivals, the dwarfs from the
Highlands.”
PUNCH*S POLITICAL DICTIONARY.
LonDs, House of. One of the constituent parts of the Parliament
of the United Kingdom, and comprising the body known as the Peers;
so that they who insist that our Constitution is peerless, are guilty of a
slight error. The Lords are either spiritual, including the archbishops
and bishops, or temporal, who may have been so called from their
ancestors having first obtained their dignities by a readiness to
temporise. The eldest son of a peer is a peer at his father's death—as
if in the aristocracy of talent the eldest son of a poet should be born
a poet. From the old proverb, one would imagine this was the rule of
succession to the Temple of the Muses; but the words poeta nascitur,
must be qualified by non fit, which may be translated, “Unless he is
not fit for it.” Peers are sometimes created from amongst lawyers and
soldiers, when, to prevent the coronet being like a tin-kettle fastened
on to the head, as in the celebrated dog case it was tied to the tail, it is
usual to settle a pension in tail male, on the recipient of a peerage.
The peers have been called the hereditary wisdom of the legislature ;
but as it is thought they can sometimes evince their wisdom better by
holding their tongues, and keeping away from the house, their presence
is not necessary to their votes, which may be given by proxy.
Lords Justices. Persons whom, since the Conquest, un'il very
recently, it was customary to appoint to take care of the kingdom
during the temporary absence of the sovereign. The last occasion was
on GeoRGE THE Fourth's visit to Hanover, in 1821, when nineteen
Lords Justices were appointed, and an immense number of commis-
sions, waiting for the royal signature, which was a sine qua mon, got
signed by the Lords Justices, who, being new at the work, went con
amore into it. Her present MAJESTY, who never lets, anything
connected with the business of royalty fall into arrear, had no Lords
Justices appointed on her visits to France and Germany. Railroads
and steam have given such facilities to communication, that the helm
of government may be managed at any distance, and it is not unlikely
that it may eventually be worked in one country by a sovereign in
another, through the medium of a submarine electric telegraph. The
vessel of the state is under such command, that HER MAJESTY might
give directions to “go on easy,” “turn a-head,” “turn her astern,” or
“stop her,” just as well from the Tuileries as from her own palace of
Buckingham.
THE NEW MINISTRY.
The following has been handed about the Coffee-Houses as a list of
the new Ministry :— -

LES ADIEUX D U P R EMIER.
My cab is at the door,
Of my red-box here's the key,
But before I go, Jolin RUssell,
Here's some good advice for thee.
Act, that honest hearts may love thee;
Act, that party-knaves may hate ;
And from office when they shove thee,
Have a heart to meet thy fate.
Tho' Protection roar around thee,
As loud as roar it can,
Tho' they set on to confound thee,
“Young BEN,” that “nice young man,—”
Tho' county members yell,
Tho' you sever Party's link,
Tho' Bedchamber Lords rebel,
Speak out boldly what you think.
Tho' for shorter term than mine,
Quite sufficient of a bore
You'll find office, I opine,
And be glad when it is o'er.
BENTINCR'S “SUDDEN THOUGHT.”
Lord GEORGE BENTINck has accused SIR Robert of “hunting
CANNING to death ; ” this accusation was made, too, after nineteen
years' cordial intimacy between the Lord and the homicidal Baronet.
LoRD GeoRGE surely meant to parody CANNING's speech in The
Rovers :—“A sudden thought strikes me ; let us swear eternal hatred.”

Lot 1. The Seat of War (in India).-This seat has been very much
knocked about, and has scarcely a leg to stand upon. With a little
money, however, judiciously laid out, it could be put into immediate
repair. It has been carried about for half a century all over India, and
is now to be disposed of, as the owners have no further use for it. It is
offered to the French Government as a seat the best adapted for the
standing army in Algiers. With a little French polish, and turning
the seat into Morocco, it is an article which will last for years.
Lot 2. The Glass of Fashion.—This glass has lost its brilliancy, from
having been so frequently looked into. It is best calculated for those
persons whose evening's amusements will bear the morning's reflection,
as every object viewed through it is seen in a new light. Old beaux

silver well laid out on this Glass of Fashion.

England have lately been smoking, being put up for sale, but this
depends entirely upon Lord PALMERston being made Minister for
Foreign Affairs.

during the march of intellect, will be also submitted to the amateurs
of rare things.
Lot 6. A few Flowers of Rhetoric, and severall'igures of Speech, will
be handed round the room for the inspection of parliamentary and pot-
house orators. The flowers are beautifully cut and dried, and have
been º in the leaves of HANsard. The figures are well stuffed,
and clothed in the strongest language.
Lor 7. The Laurels of Field-Marshal Prince ALBERT, as reared
by him in the gardens of Buckingham Palace, will be shown for the
inspection of all military persons who produce their Waterloo medals,
and small sprigs will be sold to country gentlemen who hold commis-
sions in Her MAJEsty's Militia.
Lot 8. The Silver Spoon which MR. Hudson had in his mouth when
he was born, will be put up for competition among railway chairmen.
The Clothes which the Tories ran away with when the Whigs were
bathing, will be hung round the room, but will not be sold, as they
form part of a collection of unredeemed pledges.
In addition to the above attractions, the celebrated Rod of Iron,
which was formerly used in England, has been sent over from Ireland
expressly for this sale, and the Rule which BRITANNIA uses in ruling
the waves, will be kindly lent by Lond ELLENBorough for this exhibi-
tion only.

“I’ll Trouble You to MEAsure ME for A New Pain of Boots.”
T H E S N OBS OF ENG LAND,
py ONE OF THEMSELVES.
CHAPTER XVIII.-ON SOME POLITICAL SNOBS.
I Don't know where the Snob-Amateur finds more specimens of his
favourite species than in the political world. Whig Snobs, Tory and
Radical Snobs, Conservative and Young England Snobs, Official and
Parliamentary Snobs, Diplomatic Snobs, and About-the-Court Snobs
present themselves to the imagination in numberless and graceful
varieties, so that I scarcely know which to show up first.
My private friends are aware that I have an aunt who is a Duchess,
and as such, Lady of the Powder-Closet ; and that my cousin, Lord
PETER, is Pewter-Stick in Waiting and Groom of the Dust-Pan. Had
these dear relatives been about to hold their positions, nothing would
have induced me to be savage upon that dismal branch of the political
Snobs to which they belong ; but her Grace and Lord PETER are
going out with the present administration ; and perhaps it will alle-
viate the bitterness occasioned by their own resignation, if we have a
little fun and abuse of their successors.
This is written before the ministerial changes are avowed ; but I
hear in the best society (indeed ToM SPIFFLE told me at the BARON
DE Houndsditch's déjeuner at Twickenham last week) that LionEL
RAMPANT succeeds to my cousin PETER’s Pewter-Stick, Tof FY is
next to certain of the Dust-Pan ; whilst the Powder-Closet has been
positively promised to LADY GULEs.
What the deuce can her ladyship want with such a place 2 is a
question which suggests itself to my simple mind. If I had thirty
thousand a year, if I had gouty feet, (though this is a profound secret)
and an amiable epileptic husband at home, like LoRD GULEs, and a
choice of town and country houses, parks, castles, villas, books, cooks,
carriages, and other enjoyments and amusements, would I become a
sort of a-kind of a what-d'ye-callem—of an upper servant in fact—
to a personage ever so illustrious and beloved ? Would I forsake my
natural rest, my home and society, my husband, family, and indepen-
dence, to take charge of any powder-puff in any establishment ; to
speak under my breath, to stand up for hours before any young Prince,
however exalted ? Would I consent to ride backwards in a carriage,
when the delicacy of my constitution rendered that mode of transit
peculiarly odious to me, because there was a scutcheon, surmounted
by an imperial crown, on the panels, of which the chief was a field, or
with three lions gules 2 No. I would yield in affection for my In-
stitutions to none ; but I would cultivate my loyalty, and respect my
crown de loin. For, say what you will, there is always something
|ludicrous and mean in the character of a flunkey. About a neat-
handed PHILLIs, who lays your table and brushes your carpet without
pretension; a common servant who brushes your boots and waits
behind your chair in his natural and badly-made black coat, there is
no absurdity or incongruity; but when you get to a glorified flunkey in
|lace, plush, and aiguillettes, wearing a bouquet that nobody wears, a
powdered head that nobody wears, a gilt cocked-hat only fit for a
baboon,_I, say the well-constituted man can't help grinning at this
foolish, monstrous, useless, shameful caricature of a man which Snob-
|bishness has set up to worship it; to straddle behind its carriage with
preternatural calves; to carry its prayer-book to church in a velvet
bag ; to hand it little three-cornered notes, bowing solemnly, over a
| silver tea-tray, &c. There is something shameful and foolish, I say, in
John as at present constituted.
We can't be men and brothers as long as that poor devil is made to
antic before us in his present fashion—as long as the unfortunate
wretch is not allowed to see the insult passed upon him by that
ridiculous splendour. This reform must be done. We have abolished
negro slavery. John must now be emancipated from plush. And I
| expect that flunkies unborn will thank and bless Punch; and if he has
not a niche beside WILLIAM WILBERFoRCE in the Palace of Westmin-
| ster, at least he ought to have a statue in the waiting-room where the
servants assemble.
And if John is ridiculous, is not a Pewter-Stick in waiting 2 If
John in his yellow plush inexpressibles dangling behind my lady's
| carriage, or sauntering up and down before St. James's Palace while
| his mistress is spreading out her train at the Drawing-room, is an
| object of the saddest contempt, poor fellow, of the most ludicrous
splendour—one of the most insane and foolish live caricatures which
this present age exhibits—is my LoRD PETER, the Pewter-Stick, far
behind him 2 And do you think, my dear sir, that the public will
bear this kind of thing for many centuries longer ? How long do you
suppose Court Circulars will last, and those tawdry old-world humiliating
ceremonials which they chronicle 2. When I see a body of beef-eaters
in laced scarlet ; a parcel of tradesmen dressed up as soldiers, and
calling themselves Gentlemen Pensioners, and what not ; a theatre-
manager (though this I acknowledge, by the way, is seldom enough)
| grinning before Majesty with a pair of candles, and walking back-
wards in a Tom-Fool's coat, with a sword entangling his wretched legs;
a bevy of pompous officers of the household bustling and strutting and
clearing the way; am I filled with awe at the august ceremony ?
Ought it to inspire respect 2 It is no more genuine than the long
faces of mutes at a funeral—no more real than Lord GeoRGE BEN-
TINck's grief about MR. CANNING, let us say. What is it makes us all
laugh at the picture in the last number (which picture is alone worth
the price of the volume), of “Punch Presenting yº Tenth Volume to
y" QUEENE ** The admirable manner in which the Gothic art and
ceremony is ridiculed ; the delightful absurdity and stiffness; the
outrageous aping of decorum ; the cumbrous ludicrous nonsensical
splendour. Well ; the real pageant is scarcely less absurd—the Chan-
cellor's wig and mace almost as old and foolish as the Jester's cap and
bauble. Why is any Chancellor, any Stage-Manager, any Pewter-
Stick, any John called upon to dress himself in any fancy dress, or to
wear any badge 2 I respect my Bishop of London, my RIGHT
ReverEND CHARLEs JAMEs, just as much since he left off a wig as I
did when he wore one. I should believe in the sincerity of his piety,
even though a John, in purple raiment (looking like a sort of half-pay
Cardinal), didn't carry his Lordship's prayer-books in a bag after
him to the Chapel Royal : nor do I think Royalty would suffer, or
Loyalty be diminished, if Gold, Silver, and Pewter-Sticks were
melted, and if the Grandes Charges à la Cour—Ladies of the Powder
Closet, Mistresses of the Pattens, and the like, were abolished in saccula
saculorum.
And I would lay a wager, that by the time Punch has published his
eightieth volume, the ceremonies whereof we have here been treating
will be as dead as the Corn-Laws, and the nation will bless Punch and
PEEL for destroying both.

Little Boy.—“Oh, Loh, MAR, I Feel Just exactly as IF MY Jacket
was Button Ep.”
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
M I SS R O B | N S O N C R U S O E.
CHAPTER I.
I was born in the year (but no—I claim the privilege of an un-
married woman, and will not set down the date)—in the city of West-
dear aunt fainted, as she declared, at the smell of it. I could dance,
sing, and speak the very best Italian for—India. My father, seeing
me constantly poring over the ship advertisements in the Times,
guessed my intentions. One day he was confined to his room, having
dined the day before at Blackwall. He sent for me, and expostulated
with me on what he foresaw was my determination.
“My child,” he said, “do you not perceive that you are born in the
happiest state—that is, in the middle state of life 2 Consider how
much grief, either way, you escape by such a fortune. I will suppose
you an earl's daughter—in time, to be married to a duke. Reflect
upon the drudgery that would then await you. Compelled to be always
playing a part ; obliged, on all state occasions, to go and mob it at
court; to stand behind stalls at fancy fairs; to be trundled about in a
carriage, leaving bits of pasteboard from house to house; and, worse
than all, if your husband should be a Cabinet Minister, to be obliged,
every other month, to be nothing more than a Court lady's-maid, with
this difference—that you're allowed to wear your own diamonds, and
now and then permitted to see a follower. On the other hand, you
might have made shirts at fivepence apiece, and bound shoes at a
farthing a pair. Whereas, you hold the happy middle state of life ;
a state that peeresses would jump out of their ermine tippets to fall
into.”
After this he pressed me not to think of leaving home; and further,
promised that he would look about him for a husband for me—a
steady, respectable young man of my own condition. But I had my
head too full of rajahs and elephants to put up with steadiness and
respectability. My mother, too, often scolded me, and rated my father
for sending me to that finishing-school. “I always said what would
come of it,” she cried, “when I heard that the girls, before they
went to balls and concerts, always swallowed eau-de-cologne upon lump
sugar to make their eyes twinkle—I always prophesied how she'd
turn out, and so it’s come to pass.”
Thus rebuked, I suffered a year to pass away in silence. One day,
however, being at Gravesend, eating shrimps upon the pier, six beautiful
East Indiamen, in full sail, passed down the river. The tears came
into my eyes, and my smothered resolution burst anew into a flame.
I resolved, without loss of time, to take my passage for the East.
I returned to London; but, instead of going straight home, I went to
the Docks, where I accosted a CAPTAIN Biscuit, of the ship Ramo
Samee, of I don't know how many tons. Observing that as he passed
his tobacco over his tongue, he looked suspiciously at my youthful
appearance, I assured him that I had been married at fifteen, in India,
that the climate disagreeing with my only child, a lovely boy, I had
brought him to England, to remain with his grandmother, and was
now only too anxious to rejoin my beloved husband at Budherapore.
When I spoke of my husband, the quick eye of the Captain glanced
at my left hand ; happily, as I wore gloves, he could not observe that
no ring was on my finger. Instructed, however, by this accident, on
minster. My father was a foreigner of Heligoland, who settled first at
Sheerness. He made a good estate by dealing in slops, which he
profitably sold to the sailors ; and leaving off his trade, lived after-
wards in Westminster. Here it was he married my mother, whose
name was Robinson, whose ancestor was the famous JACK RoBINson,
of whom is still retained a popular proverb, relating to rapidity of
expression.
Being the third daughter, and, unlike my two sisters, single—and
my father having impoverished himself by bestowing two large dow-
ries, leaving nothing for me excepting at his death,<-I had little hopes
of marrying in England, or, in other words, of bettering my fortune.
I therefore resolved to cross the seas. I had read of several young
ladies who, with no money, and very small trunks indeed—and with
hardly beauty enough to make any man in England turn back to look
at them—had married general officers and rajahs in India. I had
heard, and with the easy confidence of youth believed the story, that
such was the demand for young-lady-wives in the East Indies, that
the black men's boats that brought off cocoa-nuts and yams to the
ship, on her dropping anchor, also brought off gentlemen covered with
diamonds, and provided with wedding-rings. In many instances, the
ship carrying a parson, the ceremony was immediately performed in
the Captain's cabin ; and the happy couple on landing, immediately
started five hundred miles up the country to spend the honeymoon.
With these thoughts haunting me all day, I dreamt of nothing at
nights but palanquins and elephants, and a husband continually giving
me diamonds and pearls as big as swan's eggs.
And when I recollected the education my parents had given me—
with all the advantages of the Blackheath finishing-school—I had no
cause for despair. I could play at least six tunes upon the grand
piano : I had worked a melon in Berlin wool so naturally, that my
my way home I purchased a ring at a pawnbroker's in the Minories;
purchased it with a fervent hope that, sooner or later, the ring would
|º found to be of more than money's value. I ought, however, to
state that I took my passage with the Captain, the number of my
cabin, 20. For this I was to pay seventy pounds. I paid him—for
I always managed to have money about me—twenty pounds in
advance. “What name 7" said he ; “MRs. BIGGLEswape,” said I;
and I saw him write down, “MRs. BIGGLEswald E, cabin 20,” on the
list.
As for three years past I had determined upon this step, I had
saved nearly all the money allowed me by my dear father for pocket-
money and clothes. And as, moreover, I made it always a point of
being lucky at cards, I found myself mistress of a hundred and fifty
sovereign pieces. “Now,” thought I, “if my outfit even costs me fifty
pounds, I shall have, passage and all paid, thirty pounds left ;”
money, I thought, more than sufficient, even though a husband should
not come off in the boat with the cocoa-nuts and yams, to marry me
in the Captain's cabin.
All my thoughts were now bent upon my outfit. With this purpose,
I used to steal out morning after morning to make my purchases ;
having them all sent to the house of a good woman—she had been our
cook, and had married a green-grocer—to keep for me for the appointed
time. Ilaid in six dozen of double-scented lavender; a dozen of the finest
milk of roses; twenty pounds of the best pearl powder ; a gross of
court-plaster; six ounces of musk; a quart of oil of bergamotte ; two
boxes of rouge, and—not to weary the reader—a hundred of the like
articles, indispensable to a young gentlewoman.
I next visited MADAME CRINoLINE’s, and entirely cleared the dear
creature's window of her whole stock of petticoats, etcetera, of horsehair.
I had heard that birds were caught with horse-hair; and why not ?–

in the skittishness of my heart I thought—why not husbands 2 Besides
this—as I had heard much of the effects of Indian fevers—I bought
myself three sets of curls, brown, dark brown, and auburn. To
capture in an engagement, I thought it was lawful to use any colours.
My outfit completed, I awaited, with beating heart, the 10th of May.
On that day the Ramo Samee was to drop down to Gravesend. On
that day I left my home, telling my dear father that I was going with
some fashionable acquaintances to the exhibition of a sweet little love
of a child with two heads and twelve toes. I hurried with my faithful
friend to Gravesend. She went on board the ship with me ; and,
before the Captain, kissed me and bade me farewell, as her dear
daughter.
We weighed anchor; the breeze freshened, and I went below, with
some natural thoughts about my native land and my band-boxes.
ANALYSIS OF THE STABLE MIND.
The stable variety of the human mind has so long escaped the
notice of metaphysicians; but now that LoRD GEORGE BENTINck has
brought it into celebrity, it is high time that it should be analytically
explored. The principal faculties of the ordinary mind are considered
to be Perception, Concep-
tion, Memory, Imagination,
and Judgment. In the sta-
ble mind these powers are
remarkably modified. Per-
ception exists, but it is
confined to the points of a
horse—to his harness, and
appurtenances, and to those
weaknesses in the human
character that constitute
the dupe or flat. Conception
is as limited in its nature;
but Comprehension is ex-
tensive, regarded as the
faculty of taking in.
The Memory of the stable
mind is strong with regard
to certain events, such as
bets made some time ago;
but it is observed to fail
with respect to thesein cases
wherein its possessor has
lost his wager.
As to Imagination, it can
hardly be said to exist at
all in the stable mind,
which has no appreciation
whatever of the sublime or
beautiful; but rather de-
lights in the reverse of
both ; and it is remarkable,
that the productions of sta-
ble-minded painters are
characterised by being
wholly unimaginative.
The horse, the whole horse, and nothing but the horse, except the
hostler, is the staple of stabular art. As to Judgment, when it is
said that the stable mind is a good judge of horse-flesh, as much 1S
said of it as can be truly predicated. With respect to certain other
mental qualities, it may be stated, that Taste, in the stable mind, is
the simple sensibility to the aesthetics of tits and turns-out; that
Attention is merely an habitual concentration upon the same objects;
and that Sympathy is nothing but a fellow-feeling with other minds of
a kindrel—that is, a stable order. We ought not to omit the mention
of Association, which the stable mind displays very strongly, in , a
tendency to keep company with grooms and jockeys. This principle,
also, of Association, it is that regulates the language in which the
stable mind expresses its ideas, its phraseology being borrowed from
the class of persons with whom it is accustomed to consort.

THE MIDDLE AGES.
SoME well-meaning people are continually talking of “the good old
times,” as if the present times were not good enough for all practical
purposes. We suspect that if we could go back to the habits of our
ancestors we should find them rather inconvenient; and as an illustra-
tion, or rather as a series of illustrations of this theory, the annexed
drawings may be of some service.
Though some of the liveries of
the present day are ridiculous
enough, we think the absurdity
and bad taste might be trumped
by the above representation of
a middle-age turn-out, with
middle-age coachmen and
flunkeys.

A RAILWAY REVIEW.
THE London and Birmingham Railway, having a company of individuals employed upon it
no less than two thousand strong, felt of course some anxiety to show off before IBRAHIM
PACHA, and a grand Railway Review was at once resolved upon. The Euston detachment
of Heavy Porters was accordingly drawn up in line, for the purpose of performing some of
the wonderful and difficult evolutions that are requisite in consequence of the break of gauge.
The gallant fellows looked exceedingly well, and wore their rich velveteen corslets over their
cotherme of fustian. The usual articles being put in requisition for the performance of drill,
namely, a pig, a picture, a child, some eggs, and a box of glass, on the word being given to
“Shift Luggage,” the manoeuvre was splendidly performed, though some finconvenience was
occasioned by the eggs and glass being rather refractory. . This favourite piece of Railway
drilling is accomplished in different ways, according to the article it is required to shift.
Thus, when the word of command is given to “Shift Luggage,” the man who has to perform
this operation on a pig, brings his right hand smartly down on the animal's ear at the word
“shift;" on the syllable “lug,” he grasps the creature's tail; and on the “gauge” being pro-
nounced, runs off with the poor brute from one gauge to the other. A child may be treated
in much the same way; but eggs, glass, and pictures, are rather more difficult in dealing with; for
as they are packed in different ways, and it is not always easy to ascertain which is the top
and which is the bottom, the side that ought to be upwards is sometimes downwards, to the
great damage of the property. The corps of Railway police was next put through its exercise,
which was performed to the perfect satisfaction of IBRAHIM PACHA.
At the words “Collar Passenger,”—a manoeuvre sometimes rendered necessary by the
manoeuvre of the passenger himself, being desirous of avoiding the payment of his fare—
several well-dressed individuals were clutched by the coat with beautiful precision and
prompt alacrity. The only part of the drilling in which we fancied we noted a want of uni-
formity was in the “signal exercise,” where, to use an expression appropriate to the subject,
the police corps most signally failed. At the conclusion of the Review IBRAHIM PACHA retired,
much pleased with the discipline of the Railway troops, and the generally effective manner in
which they went through their arduous exercise. By his Highness's request, the pig that
had been employed to illustrate the shifting of luggage on the break of gauge, was introduced
on the following day to IBRAHIM PACHA, at dinner.
$ale of ſtianuštripts.
A very interesting sale of Manuscripts has recently taken place, and the prices fetched
have suggested to us the idea of bringing into existence a new class of property. Several
lots, for which we would have given the regular waste-paper market-price, appear to have sold
exceedingly well. For instance, 249 duplicate letters, from January 3rd to November 28th,
1678, written or signed by SIR LEoline JENRINs, commanded at auction no less than
seventy pounds. We presume SIR LEolin E JENKINs was some illustrious pawnbroker ;
but however famous he may have been in his day, seventy pounds seems to be a high
figure for 249 of his duplicates.
We were rather surprised at the high price obtained for three letters by the DUKE of
WELLINGTON, considering the extreme facility there has been in extracting a billet from
the hero of Waterloo. The three letters, which
sold for four pounds eleven shillings, must have
paid the parties well if the epistles happened
to have been answers to such inquiries as
whether MR. Jones is liable to be drawn for
the militia 2 If he can be released from the
income-tax, or some other of the numerous
frivolities on which it is customary to put
queries to his Grace, which his Grace is in
the amiable habit of answering, any one has
only to invest a shilling in postage stamps,
write to the Duke, get his answers, and put
them up to auction in a collection of manu-
scripts.
The literary signatures did not fetch a great
deal, though, perhaps, more than might have
been expected. JoHNsoN's sigmature to a receipt
went for only three guineas, though such a
document must have been rare indeed, for the
Doctor was, according to Boswell, in the habit
of forgetting the names of the subscribers to
his books, and spending the money, so that it
º not likely he was very fond of giving receipts
or it.
A letter from STERNE respecting the loan of
20l. sold for 31, 18s., which appears to be a good
price for a single letter. A poor author in the
present day cannot get as much for his signa-
ture, even when it is enhanced by the addition
of a bill stamp worth a couple of shillings.
Perhaps these things, which go begging
among the money lenders in the present day,
will be snapped up some day by collectors, at
a high price. It is only to be regretted that no
one has the spirit and enterprise to invest his
money in these treasures while the authors are
alive, to profit by the value which posterity may
set upon their autographs.
A NOTE FROM THE SHADES.
“MR. GRAY, poet, and author of a little thing
intitled, An Elegy written in a Country Church-
yard, presents his compliments to Mr. Punch,
and wishes to know if the subjoined four lines
might not be appropriately inscribed on the
pedestal of a statue (in biscuit) erected in the
matter of the Corn Laws, to SIR Robert
PEEL :—
“The applause of listening senates to command,
The threats of pain and ruin to despise;
To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land,
And read his history in a nation's eyes?’”
Punch, in answer, begs to inform MR. GRAY
that he (Punch) has submitted the verse to the
opinion of MR. DisrAELI, and that crystal-
headed legislator pronounces its fitness to be
admirable.
THE DOG-DAYS.
WE now understand the use of the basins
in Trafalgar Square. They were evidently
never meant to be ornamental, but they promise
to become extremely useful. During the late
warm weather we observed several dogs standing
on their hind legs drinking out of the basin.
The dogs like to have their water like ginger
beer, “fresh from the fountain.” There is no
doubt the basins are kept as large preventives
against hydrophobia, and we must say, ugly as
they are, we only wish there were more of them
in the metropolis. Notices should be written
up, directing the canine species to Trafalgar
Square, with directions, to avoid confusion, that
“they are to sit down with their heads towards
Pall Mall, and to take up with their tails on a
line with the lion's at the top of Northumberland
House.”

MR. PUNCH's ThoughtS ON HIS RETURN FROM THE HOUSE ON
MONDAY EVENING, JUNE 29.
HE is gone, dear friends. We saw him drive down to the House,
rolling in his gold coach like KING Pippin, but his heart must have
been cheered by the roar of thousands of voices, which said “God bless
him " "Did he catch sight of Punch up in a lamp-post, yelling, “Bravo,
PEEL 1 PEEL for ever !” fit to crack his lungs 2 Dear old PEEL We
have had many a tiff—but he is gone, and the Whigs are in. Which is
the better, cum Whiggibus versari quam tui meminisse 7 Now he is
gone, the thought strikes one. Perhaps, to live with them will be less
sweet than to remember Bob.
He went to the House : and the dear old fellow made his last speech,
and recanted so as to bring tears into your eyes. He spoke about
Ireland. If he had but spoken a little sooner in that way, where
would Repeal be 2 O'Connell says he is fit to be a Precursor. Will
the Whigs follow him 2. They must, my dear friends ; there's nothing
like emulation. They'll bid any price against him. Let us keep up
this wholesome competition, and we shall have the day which the
Liberator pines for, when he shall give up agitation and retire to
Derrynane.
He spoke about the finances of the country: and on this subject the
If France should have war with us—which we hope will never be the
case—she would no doubt make frequent captures of QUEEN Victoria's
canary, or PRINCE ALBERT's prize bullock. Any of our enemies are quite
welcome to trophies like these, provided they catch hold of nothing of
greater value.
Heavens, is it possible 2 by a man who never was at Oxford ; by a fel-
low who is a cotton-spinner, and once, they say, was a bag-man ; by a
person who is not a natural-born patriot and leader of the people, as
the Whigs are—by Richard Cobden "
Yes ; he acknowledged it. One of the people has achieved the great
pacific revolution of the world; not a man whose fathers have done
“priceless services,” like Lord John Russell's, who have been martyrs
ever since HENRY THE Eighth's reign, but a mere Manchester trader,
of whom the Whigs thought so highly that they offered him a fifteenth-
rate place when there was a talk of their coming into office through
his means, some month ago.
And so the great aristocracy of England is beaten. The rebels
among them are disgracefully routed. The doubtful come in and proffer
a sulky surrender. The wisest, cleverest, and most prudent of them
hand in their allegiance, and take the oath, on their knees, to Rich ARD
Cobden. O ghost of the Protector, behold Richard your heir O
red-nosed shade of Oliver, rise up and see
But, what is the best, the battle being over, little Lord JoHN will
come in and calmly take the government of the army, and divide the
plunder, and parcel out the commands to the little Whig family, so
that they may do a few more “priceless services” to the nation.
PEEL is gone meanwhile ; and shall we long miss our Bobby from
his box * What will BEN DisrAELI do now * The amiable creature
will pine like the ivy, when his attached oak is removed from him. My
Whigs did not seem easy. He found the finances queer and he left
them prosperous. He found the revenue poorly and left it jolly and
thriving. He levied an income-tax, which people were happy to pay,
although the Whigs did say it was a cruel imposition on a suffering
people. He talked about extended commerce and Free Trade, and the
Whigs (Heaven bless them) cheered as if they had invented it.
After talking of foreign commerce he talked of foreign relations. It
may be doubted whether IBRAHIM PAchA would ever have dined at the
Reform Club, if the Tories had not kept the peace with MEHEMET ALI.
We are all right all over Europe, where everybody loves our artless and
simple disposition. The British Lion has roared at Ching-wang-foo so
as to make the Mandarins tremble—he is rampant on the entrench-
ments of Ferozeshah—he scours the plain of Aliwal—and he wags his
tail in the waters of the Columbia (up to the 49th parallel) without any
fear of the Yankee rifle.
Then as to Corn-law repeal—“No,” says PEEL, with delightful candour,
“it was not I that did that ; nor Lord JoHN, that takes the benefit
of the act : it came from a greater than either—it was done, Gracious
dear friends, I think of PEEL and what he has done, and what he has
undone. Let by-gones be by-gones. I should like to shake the hand
that floored the Corn-law, and gave HAYDoN fifty pounds. I never

THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
M | S S R O B | N S O N C R U S O E.
CHAPTER II.
EING booked as a married lady
about to return to her husband at
Hyderabad, I was particularly
cautious in my conversation with
many of the female passengers, the
greater number of whom were
really the wedded wives of officers
and state civilians; ladies who had
really left their little ones in Eng-
land, and were returning to their
Indian firesides. I say I was
reserved in my speech, lest I might
betray my inexperience. Besides
the married ladies, there were a
dozen young gentlewomen, con-
signed to the Captain for the same
purpose as I proposed to myself;
namely, for instant marriage on
their arrival. I will confess it,
that the number of spinsters a
little disconcerted me ; as I had
picked out from newspapers something about the harmony of demand
and supply, and therefore knew that if only twelve officers came off
in the yam and cocoa-boats for a wife, there must, by every rule of
arithmetic, remain one virgin unwedded. I will not attempt to
describe my perturbation when I reflected that this one might be
myself However, after I had well surveyed the whole twelve, I
took great heart. Three had very red hair ; four irregular teeth;
two—but no ; it is a melancholy, a thankless task to number the
imperfections of our fellow-creatures. Let it suffice that, with the
ingenuousness of a woman's soul, I knew myself to be the most
attractive of the lot. Thus, I would not despair should even a
general officer come off in the cocoa-boat.
Much that I saw and heard, naturally enough, surprised and dis-
concerted me. I was a week at least before I could reconcile myself
to the frequent order to “put the ship in stays.” At first I believed
it was nothing but CAPTAIN Biscuit's wit ; but as nobody laughed, I
of course looked as grave as the rest. When, too, the Captain declared
that “he knew we should have a squall before night,” I, innocently
enough, asked him, “which lady among us he thought most likely to
scream 2 ” Silly creature that I was . But I was soon to learn the
difference between a feminine scream, and the scream of BoreAs. A
warning this, I trust, to all roving young ladies who, not content with
the chance of steady and sober husbands (as my dear mother, with
tears in her eyes, used to call 'em) at home, must even take ship for
the Indies to marry officers in regimentals, and so—but I will not
anticipate the sorrows that overtook me.
We had sailed for many days with the wind, as they told me, south-
west by west ; which, as well as I could then make out, was as much
as to say the Elephant and Castle by St. James's Church. Thus, after
my own fashion, did I make out the theory of the winds. When we
had been at sea a week, CAPTAIN Biscuit with peculiar emphasis
declared that we were at last “in blue water.” It was not of course
for me to contradict him : but, looking over the ship, the colour
appeared exactly what I had often bought at the mercer's for a sea-
green. But CAPTAIN Biscuit was an odd man.
We had been at sea, I think, twenty-seven days, when we killed a
dolphin. The sweet creature died beautifully. As I stood contem-
plating the brilliant hues of the expiring fish, beholding how the
colours burned and intermingled, a tear stole into my eye, and the
words involuntarily escaped my lips, “What a lovely shot for a
dress " And this is human vanity Alas ! how little did I dream
of the terrors of the coming night. The sun went down like a ball of
dull fire, in the midst of smearing clouds of red-currant jam. The
winds began to whistle worse than any of the lowest orders of society
in a shilling gallery. Every wave was suddenly as big and high as
Primrose Hill. The cords of the ship snapped like bad stay-laces.
No best Genoa velvet was ever blacker than the firmament ; and not
even the voices of the ladies calling for the stewardess were heard
above the orchestral crashing of the elements.
For myself, with one hand clutching the side of my berth, lest I
|L.
4.
ºn.
should be rolled into the bosom of a whole family lying in disorder
before me, and the other grasping a smelling-bottle, my thoughts–
what could they do?—flew backward, home. Then I saw my father,
mildly sipping his one glass of toddy ere he departed for bed; my
mother making believe to knit ; TIB, the cat, upon the hearth; Joss,
the pug, upon the stool ; and my sampler—yes, so roused was my
fancy, I saw my own sampler—with the row of yew-trees, in green
silk, framed and glazed above the chimney ! And then my father's
words, “I’ll get you a sober and steady husband,” rang in my brain ;
and—so quick is imagination in moments of peril–I absolutely saw
that interesting man, saw him as my wedded lord, and beheld myself
in a very sweetly furnished house, surrounded by I know not how
many happy children. The thought was too much for me. I wept.
I know not how long I had remained in this sad condition, when I
heard the voice of CAPTAIN Biscuit shouting down into the cabin–
“Tumble up, ladies Ship’s going down " I leapt from my berth,
and with wonderful presence of mind seized a favourite bandbox.
Nor, even in that hour of terror, were the curls (spoken of in my last
chapter) forgotten. I will not dwell upon the scene that met my
view when I rushed upon deck; though the patterns of some of the
nightcaps I saw never can go out of my mind.
As I was about to rush by the gangway, I was seized—I know not
by whom—and literally flung into the barge below. This violence
struck the bandbox from my hand ; and I saw it borne away for
ever by the remorseless deep. Ere, however, I could express my
feelings upon this bitter loss, I heard a shout—the voice, I think, of
CAPTAIN Biscuit—the barge gave a lurch, and when I was next
conscious, I found myself alone upon the deep—miraculously supported
by my garments—and in this manner passed along from wave to
wave. This, however—I knew it—could not last. Gathering my
senses about me, I therefore began to swim.
And here let me bless my prudence that had turned a month's
visit to Margate to profit, teaching me to swim. I might, with the
thoughtless and vain, have raffled at libraries—I might have sat whole
hours upon the beach pretending to read the last new lovely tale—
but no, I knew—I felt—that life was made for better things ; and
therefore, once a day, launched out into the deep, and—in flowing
garments, learned to swim. The curious world might be gathered on
the beach ; I cared not, but struck out. And now, at the most
eventful moment of my life, I found the value of my skill. Therefore
is it, that I hope my example will turn some of my sex from dancing
in all its variety of vanity to a more worthy and enduring accomplish-
ment. True, dancing may obtain a husband; but swimming saves a
life. Happy, then, the woman who quits the ball-room for the deep-
who turns from cork-soles for a cork-jacket. To return to my story.
After much swimming, a mighty wave threw me ashore; but NEP-
TUNE, doubtless for some unknown purpose, sent a bigger wave to
fetch me back again; fortunately, however, my flounces—they were
worn then very full—catching among the rocks, held me fast ashore.
Taking advantage of this circumstance, I rose and ran away from the
next billow.
I looked about me. It was plain I was upon some island. Yet,
although my father had been regularly charged for my learning the
use of the globes at the Blackheath School, the fault was either in the
teachers or myself, that I could not possibly guess upon what part of
the world I was landed.
Not wearing pockets, I had secured nothing about me, except a pair
of scissors, a smelling-bottle, and a box of peppermint drops.
PROPOSED TESTIMONIAL TO MR. GOULBURN.
The Morning Post suggests to the Undergraduates of Cambridge
that, at the approaching “Commencement,” they will be expected, to
show Mr. Goulburn some fitting mark of their appreciation of his
services as Member for the University and Chancellor of the Exchequer.
The Morning Post, however, trusts, for the sake of academical decorum,
that hissing and hooting (those customary manifestations of Under-
graduate disapprobation) will not be resorted to on the occasion. There
seems to remain but one course open to the Undergraduates, namely,
to supply themselves with unmarketable eggs; and there is no doubt
that it is a testimonial in this oval form which our decorous con-
temporary intimates his desire to see adopted.
AFFECTING FAREWELL.
LoRD BRough AM left his corner of the Woolsack on Friday night.
As he took his farewell he said, in an unshaken voice, “Au Revoir.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE PREMIER'S FAREWELL.
He ministerial season has
come to a close, and the pre-
sent manager, having retired
from the direction, has been
called for in compliance with
the usual custom, and has
delivered the following ad-
dress :— -
“LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
“The period of our ma-
nagement having arrived, it
becomes my pleasing duty
to come before you, for the
purpose of thanking you for
the support with which you
have honoured us. Though
it has been our effort to
foster British productions,
we have, in accordance with
the fashion of the day, deter-
mined to avail ourselves of
foreign aid, and we hope
that the experiment may
lead to a mutual interchange
of the productions of differ-
ent countries.
“Upon referring to our
bills you will find that much
has been done, and most of
what we have undertaken
has been eminently success-
ful, in spite of some interested
opposition from quarters to
which I will not further
allude. I regret that our
last] effort, upon which we had staked our managerial success, has not met with
your usual favour. I may, perhaps, be allowed to allude to our farces, of which
several have been produced during the session, and which, thanks to the humorous
efforts of MR. DisrAEL1, and a few other performers in that line, have created the
greatest laughter.
“Hoping at some future time to meet you in my managerial capacity once more,
I now most respectfully bid you FAREwell.”
The Manager retired amid a shower of bouquets and the loudest applause.
“SMALL BY DEGREES AND BEAUTIFULLY LESS.”
|.) *****
AMoNg the wonders of the age, one of the most extraordinary is the gradual di-
minution of GENERAL ToM THUMB. This curious fact we gather from the adver-
tising carts, which are pasted over with coloured portraits of him. From these
it would appear that the decline commenced when he undertook the character
of the “English Sportsman.” We next find him a few inches shorter, as somebody,
in a pair of tights, with a spear and a fireman's helmet. The next stage of smallness
is where he is doing the Highland Fling, after which he diminishes with fearful rapi-
dity into FREDERICK THE GREAT ; and sinks at last into the peasant of some un-
discovered country, who is dancing about with a blue shirt and a garland of sun-
flowers. His greatest littleness, however, is reserved for NApoleon, who, by
the side of the “Fine Old English Gentleman,” looks so pitiably small, that it is
our wonder the French Government has not made it a casus belli.
We perceive that he is advertised to take—positively—a “last tour in the pro-
vinces;” (which, in plain English, means the last but six,) at the end of which
time we should not be at all astonished to find him so small as to be invisible to the
naked eye. He will have to be exhibited through an oxyhydrogen microscope,
which, after multiplying him 6,000,000 times, might bring him back again to his
original size.
“A BAD Book.”—LoRD GEoRGE BENTINCR, in fighting the cause of Agricultu-
ral Protection and opposing SIR Robert, must have learnt that it is not
always safe “to take the field against the Favourite.”
DR. REID AND THE JUDGES.
IT will be remembered, that MR. BARoN PARKE threat-
ened, some short time ago, to shed his judicial wig, and
cast his baronial skin, or robe, if DR. REID was permitted
to suffocate the Court of Exchequer by his ventilating
process. As the wisdom is in the wig, and the dignity
in the gown, these appendages cannot be actually dis-
pensed with, though it may be possible to produce all
the necessary effect by placing them on thc bench by the
side of the judge, who will thus be releascl irom their
oppressive burden. It might, perhaps, be clowable for
a ticket-porter, or some other muscular individual, accus-
tomed to carry loads, to sit by the side of the judge,
decked out in the official trappings, and thus supporting
the dignity of the bench when the weather happens to
be too hot to admit of the dignity being bearable by a
person not accustomed to carry heavy packages. Counsel,
also, might perhaps be pcrmitted to combine comfort with
etiquette, by having a pole at their sides in Court, on
which the big-wig might be hung on the days appointed
for wearing it.
We merely throw cut these suggestions for the consider-
ation of our legal friends ; since it seems, that though
Parliament is to be freed from DR. REID, the courts of
Law are still to be left to the mercy of the Great Suffocater.
— — — —-
The Flags of Manchester.
THE asphalte in Manchester, owing to the warm weather,
has melted to that degree that it has officiated as a boot-
jack in pulling off gentlemen's Wellingtons and the high-
lows of the bagmen. A number of ladies' shoes have
been picked up, which had floundered in the asphalte,
and the authorities have been obliged to put up boards
marked “Dangerous,” to warn the venturesome passenger
from sinking, and finding a bituminous grave in the Man-
chester roads. We hope that the Paving Commissioners
will quickly mend their ways, and put the pavement on a
sounder footing. To insure this, we kindly advise them not
to pitch their asphalte the next time quite so strong.
A BAD OMEN.
SIR Robert PEEL again leaves behind him a surplus.
We may expect, therefore, in less than a year of the
new Government to have another proof of the Whigs’
deficiency.
“ONE GooD TURN DESERVES ANOTHER.”
LoRD BRough AM has been heard to say, that “the
last few days he has been so distracted with the new
changes, that he positively has not been able to see yet
which way to turn.”

-º-º-º:
IM PACHA’S WANDERINGS.
WE cannot feel otherwise than angry at the manner in which this
distinguished individual has been allowed as it were to shift for himself,
so far at least as he has derived any assistance or advice from official
quarters. If a small German Prince comes over to this country, every-
thing is done to make him pass his time pleasantly. Apartments in a
royal palace are assigned to him, horses from the royal stables are at
his disposal for riding ; and if he wishes for a drive he has at his
command one of the royal carriages. IBRAHIM PACHA, on the contrary,
has been compelled to put up at an hotel, to go about in a hired fly,
and when he attended the Review in Hyde Park, there being no saddle-
horse for him to ride, he was kindly provided with a charger from
Astley's stud, who of course executed all sorts of manoeuvres during
the Review, and insisted on taking IBRAHIM in a canter round and
round a small circle, like the one in which the animal had been accus-
tomed to move from his infancy. The impetuous Pacha, not being
aware of our English customs, and of the necessity for producing a
voucher that the livery stable-keeper has paid the duty upon a horse
that is hired, has of course been fearfully harassed at the various toll-
gates, by the 'pikemen coming out and inquiring respectfully whether it
is for “one day or two" that he has taken a lease of his quadruped.
IBRAHIM, who was never stopped by the pikes of the enemy, is terribly
disgusted at this obstruction from the 'pikes of a friendly power; but
the authorities having left him to his own resources there is of course
no help for him.
It has been, no doubt, observed by the public that in the reports of
our contemporaries who undertake to give intelligence of IBRAHIM's
movements, there is a great deal of the Pacha's time wholly unac-
counted for. The fact is, that he gets into all sorts of holes and
corners, into which the reporters are quite unable to follow him. He
goes every day at large,
“Without a mark, without a bound,
And traverses London round and round; ”
for nobody seems to care what becomes of him. A little while ago he
was groping about the Thames Tunnel, and subsequently we find him
a captive to a mercenary showman, imprisoned in the skeleton of a
whale, looking through the ribs like a miserable detenu through the
bars of his jail, and remaining wholly at the mercy of the ruthless
exhibitor. A few days afterwards he found his way to Chelsea—
probably in a 'bus—and wandered into Cremorne Gardens, where he
was of course instantly converted into a part of the entertainment, and
divided, with the invisible poet and the balloon, the gaze of the com-
pany. We shall expect to hear of his being found in the gallery of the
Victoria some night, or taking a refreshment ticket at the bar of the
Bower Saloon in Stangate Street, under the impression that he is going
to one of the places of amusement frequented by the aristocracy.
The manner, in which he goes blundering about London is truly
lamentable. It is not, perhaps, generally known that he came stumbling
the other day into the Punch Office. He drew up in a fly, and our
publisher seeing him enter the door, mistook him for a Lascar beggar,
and in choice Hindostanee observed, “There's nothing here for you,
my good man, so you had better go about your business.” When the
visitor was found to be IBRAHIM PACHA, every attention was of course
shown to him. He was escorted behind the counter, and the pigeon-
holes for the different works of the Punch library were pointed out to
him. He was allowed the privilege of inspecting the till, and on seeing
the heaps of money, he inquired, “how it was the national debt was
not paid off?” and added, “that if his country had a debt, and any
merchant had so much specie, it would all be taken from him to
relieve his country of its burdens.”
On his expressing a desire to see a joke actually made, one of the
writers of Punch, who happened to be in attendance, manufactured a
complete pun, first taking the raw material, then spinning it out into
a fine yarn, and then winding it round until a perfect pun was made,
which was handed over to IBRAHIM, who gave it at once to SAMI-
quare SAMUEL?—PACHA, who seemed much embarrassed what to do with
it. His Highness left the office per 'bus for Charing Cross, en route for
MIvant's. -
IBRAHIM PACHA's accidental dropping into the Reform Club has been
perhaps the most fortunate casualty he has experienced, for the mem-
bers asked him to dine on the strength of his visit. Here, however, he
was doomed to be victimised ; for though they gave him a magnificent
repast, and plenty of Champagne, in which he nearly succeeded in
devilling himself, they followed it up with a quantity of dry speechifying
on the merits of the late, and the prospects of the present Government.
IBRAHIM, however, mistook the glee-singers for the principal people,
and thought the speakers were quite secondary personages. He went
away with the impression that “Hail, smiling Morn,” was a sort of
ministerial programme by LoRDs John RUSSELL, GREY, and PALMER-
ston ; while the applause that followed was misinterpreted by IBRAHIM
as an expression of confidence in the new Government. He will, no
doubt, go home and say, that on a change of Administration it is usual
for the new officials to make a musical announcement of the principles
they intend to act upon.
It is lamentable to see an illustrious foreigner blundering into all
sorts of places, and forming all sorts of erroneous opinions, for want of
a little attention in the proper quarter. In the name of common
politeness, we call upon the Government to place at the disposal of the
son of MEHEMET ALI a cicerone, a laquais de place, or at least a com-
missioner. One of the two porters who stand at the Temple Gate
might, we think, be safely entrusted with this special mission.

into a huge Rock Harmonicon.
This really excellent band is
indefatigable in its efforts to fill
the air with melody, and mix
the musical wind of their instru-
ments with the salt breezes of
the ocean. An opera air amal-
gamates very nicely with an air
of AEoLUs, and NEPTUNE's
crotchets accord remarkably well
with the demisemiquavers of
DoNIzETTI. Occasionally the
band is put in requisition for
private parties; but as it would
be rather too powerful for the
small Ramsgate tenements, it
has been ingeniously arranged to
make an orchestra of the coal-
cellar, or turn the dusthole into
a bandbox, from which the
notes of the performers issue
with more softness than if they
were stationed in the apartments
where the dancing is proceeding.
The spirited proprietors of the Victoria Bazaar have added a large
assortment of sixpenny tooth-brushes to their already valuable stock,
and these useful articles are being rapidly carried off by the lucky
holders of sixpenny tickets gained by the payment of a shilling to the
Wheel of Fortune, which keeps the flower of the Cockney youth in one
continued whirl of excitement. The elegant SNoBBINs and his fasci-
nating sisters, are constantly coming forward to make the three that
are wanted to complete the number for a two-shilling chance in the
raffle for a papier-maché blotting-case, to be raffled for by sixty
subscribers—the highest to win the case and the lowest the blotting-
paper.
At one of the Libraries the enterprising lessee has secured the
services of a harp-player in real mustachios, a juvenile pianist in spec-
tacles and turn-down collar, to give the appearance of a student of
the “classical” in music, and a tenor singer with a base falsetto and a
great facility for going down very low, which he accomplishes by
bobbing down at the end of each song under the music-stool, which he
j as a kind of green-room, to retire to in the intervals of his vocal
efforts.
The commercial arrangements of the town are on the same liberal
scale as heretofore. The marquee is munificently provided with two
morning papers in the evening, and one evening paper on the day fol-
lowing ; while the Magazines for September, 1845, give pleasing variety
to the green-baize table of that establishment. The delightful apathy
of the towns-people to the exciting news of the day is very pleasing, and
proves how seclusion dulls the appetite for the gratification of morbid
curiosity.
Though the papers are brought down daily by the earliest train,
such is the Arcadian innocence of the inhabitants, that the bundle of
journals is permitted to lie unopened at the Railway Station until some
visitor, vitiated with a taste for early intelligence, rouses the natives
into a state of consciousness that the papers have arrived, and are to
be had by the trouble of going for them.
We regret to observe, that the Margate Slipper trade seems to have
fallen into decay, for we have only counted three pair in wear during
a whole week, and two of these were on the feet of a glazier's man and
a sweep, who had been desired to change their shoes on being admitted
to clean a window and sweep a chimney.

THE NEW MINISTRY.
AMoNG the various lists that were handed about during the inter-
regnum, the following appears to have escaped observation. It came
into our hands from a correspondent “upon whom we are in the habit
of relying,” as Mrs. Gamp says of the authentic sources from which
she is continually deriving her mares' nests:–
MR. PETER Borthwick.
LoRD G. BENTINCR.
First Lord of the Treasury .
Master of the Horse - - - -
Lord Chancellor, and Keeper of the
Royal Conscience. . - - - MR. J. A. Roebuck.

Governor-General of India - . . RAMo SAMEE.
Commander in Chief . - - . Colon EL Sibthorpe.
Lord Chamberlain . - - . . MR. WIDDIcombe.
First Lord of the Admiralty. - MR. T. P. CookE.
It will be seen that the above appointments would have comprised
that union of parties which is thought in the present day absolutely
essential to the stability of a government. Though some of the new
ministers might have been objected to, it must be allowed that the
attempt to introduce “all the talents" was at least a bold one.
Whether such a government could have held power through an entire
session may be a matter of doubt, but it might, at all events, have been
worth while, under existing circumstances, to have tried the
experiment.
NEW PATENTS.
MR. DENNIs SMITH, of Patrick Street, Dublin, has taken out a
patent for a new Carriage, with a pair of horses both before and
behind. It is on the principle of the Ant and Bee steamboats, which
have a rudder at each end, to save the trouble of turning. The new
carriage has not been tried yet, as some little difficulty has been ex-
perienced in inducing the horses to run backward ; but it is expected
that with a pair of good jibbers this difficulty will soon be got over.

MR. SEPTIMUs SHARPE has taken out a patent for a new vehicle
which is to combine the utile of an omnibus with the dulce of a
watering-cart, that is to say, every omnibus for the future is to be its

affixed to the bottom part of the omnibus which will keep playing as
long as it is in motion, and cease the moment it stops.

SUICIDE PREVENTED.
Though it may have been suicide in SIR. R. PEEL to persevere with his Goer-
cion Bill, we must reconcile ourselves to the official death of a Minister, when we
find that his sacrifice has saved the lives of forty Irishmen. It appears, from a
letter addressed by MR. O'Connell to “Dear RAY,” that “the Repealers, to a
man, had resolved to perish on the floor of the House rather than the Bill should
pass.” We suppose they all came provided with bare bodkins into the House on
the memorable night of the Division, to give themselves their respective quietuses
in the event of a different result from that which happened. What a noise
the report in the next morning's newspapers would have made 1 . In the
“Summary,” we suppose it would have been merely stated that “the forty Re-
pealers then put a period to their own existences, and the House adjourned.”
Perhaps the Speaker would have quietly rung his bell, given directions to the
attendant to “sweep away the tail,” and the orders of the day might have been
disposed of if there had been any on the list. Perhaps, however—and it is the
more reasonable conjecture—the forty would have been satisfied with crying out
“Och, botheration 1 I'm murthered in I’m kilt 1” if the Bill had been suffered to
pass; for this exclamation is the extent to which “dying on the floor of the
House" is likely to be carried by the Irish members. -

EGYPTIAN IMPRESSIONS.–No. II.
From Fuppool. EFFENDI, in London, to his friend, KY Bosh-IBu-HUM-Boogee
EL-HADJ, in Musr (Cairo).
“I told thee, O HADJ, O my friend, in my last letter, how these Gaours
(dogs) and sons of Shaitan (SATAN) strove to destroy thy friend, and the Basha,
our Lord—to whom behonour!—by eating and drinking. By the head of
Hosers, they are a wonderful people. The kºrea (table) is amongst them
mooséummee alegh (sacred), even as the bread and the salt among the children
of the Prophet, to whom be honour ! If they meet together to transact busi-
ness, what is begun in the bazaar is finished over the table of wine and strong
meats. If their hearts are enlarged unto charity, it is when they have eaten
exceedingly. By my head, O HADJ, if the liver of me, thy friend, have not
º away from much eating, it is by reason of the medicines of the
allºs.
“Verily, O HADJ, O my father, our Lord the Basha hath
been much honoured in this city of Jinn (evil spirits). His
face is white before the mistress the QUEEN, and her hus-
band the Basha AL-BERT. He hath had much glory before
the chief of the unbelievers.
“This is the blessing of the Prophet. To him be the
honour! Only to a true believer it is vouchsafed to win
honour before the QUEEN, and to be very white in the eyes of
her husband the Basha AL-BERT, if he be of the ordinary
stature of man. But they that are exceedingly small—such
as he whom the Saxons call EL-THUMBEE, a son of lit-
tleness, like the people of two cubits, whom EL-SINDIBAD
beheld in the Island of Ramíne–sit in the seat of honour.
*Unto the small,” saith the Chorán, “is given wisdom.” But
never, save in this land of unbelievers, hath thy friend seen
proper honour paid unto the exceedingly little. They sit
among the councillors, and the great Agas, and the wise
chkadées (judges), and none may say unto Elsitt (the mis
tress) that their faces are black.
“Besides EL-THUMBEE, who is the smallest, and whom
they much love to honour, there is a wonderful family of
dwarfs from El-Scot (which is a town in the province of
Ed-deen-buróo). They are two brothers of smallness and
a sister of littleness, whose faces caused the knees of thy
friend to wax slack. By the head of ALEE 1 they were
ugly. These the QUEEN hath called to her, and set upon
the deewan (cushions), to take council with them, and hath
given them the robe of honour, and made her face to
shine exceedingly upon them, and bestowed on them many
thousands of deemárs (a coin equal to 106), and they are
great in the land. The Moolahs and Agas of this city tell me
that it is by reason of their smallness that they are thus
honoured. But surely, O HADJ, this is untrue. By ALLAB I
it is not true, O my father 1 But it is by reason of their wis-
dom, as the Fathah (first chapter of the Chorán) declares, that
“unto the small is knowledge.”
“Also, the Basha AL-BERT causes his face to shine upon
the largest among oxen and horses. Here is now the father
of all oxen, which is to other beasts as the rockh unto other
birds. His face is white before the Court. Yet, the Basha,
though not a little man—may his shadow be increased 1–
hath won honour, and the drops of royal favour have
flowed also over the beard of thy friend. Surely I shall write
again unto thee of other wonders.”
MINISTERIAL MOVEMENTS.
Directly the result of the division was known, Mr.
Banerless, who had been staying at Gravesend, returned to
town, and remained at his chambers to meet any contingency
that might be likely to happen. . . Unfortunately the first
contingency was the sending in of his tailor's bill; and as
this was a contingency he was quite unable to meet, he at
once returned to Gravesend.
During the whole of the crisis, CAPTAIN Snooks, of the
Waterman, moored his boat opposite the Admiralty, but
no communication reached him from that or any other official
quarter. This treatment of SNooks, is scarcely what could
have been expected by Snooks himself, but no one else seems
to have expressed the slightest astonishment. . . -
As long as the state of ministerial uncertainty existed,
Tomkins, the indefatigable accountant, took an office in the
neighbourhood, and left his address at the Exchequer, with
a circular for the Chancellor of that important department.
a New Registry office.
Lond Brough AM has registered a vow-so saysanewspaper
—not to rest till he has driven the Whigs from the head of
affairs. It is time, we think, that there was a Registry Office
for vows: they accumulate so fast that it is impossible to
recollect them all. It would be curious to see at the end of
the year how many of these vows have been kept. A heavy
fee should be paid on registering : otherwise, every old woman
in the House of Lords, and every Irish member in the House
of Commons would be rushing to the office every week to
register a new vow.

-- ADDREssed to SIR JAMEs GRAHAM. -
-- (Apropos of his speech on MR. Watson's Roman Catholic Relief Bill."
The Rooks, the Raven, and the Scarecrow.
HEN the birds peopled the earth a colony
of Rooks took possession of a field,
from which they had driven out
another race of the same colour
but different species. From time
to time some of the expatriated
birds would return timidly to
their old property, to destroy
worms and slugs, for the new
comers were very slovenly, and
cared little for the crops, i.
vided they secured enough to fill
their own craws. Whenever they
caught one of the original Rooks
at this work, they straightway
accused him of destroying the
seed, and hung him up, without
giving him time so much as to caw
in his own defence.
At last, when the wholefield was
dotted over with these unhappy
victims, and the other birds were annoyed by the perpetual persecu-
tions and executions, they remonstrated with the intruding rooks, and
declared that the original birds should be allowed their share of the
produce of the field, which was the more just, as they had reclaimed it
from the common by their own labour. The intruders made a terrible
outcry, and declared that all the original Rooks wanted, was to destroy
the grain and them together. At last, however, they agreed, on the
Eagle threatening to destroy the whole race, to give up their habit of
hanging the visitors, and allow them a corner of the field; but on one
condition, that a dreadful Scarecrow, called “Pains and Penalties,”
should be set up in the very middle of the plot they retained, to scare
away the old birds from this portion, which was nine-tenths, at least, of
the whole ground. This was done accordingly, and a very terrible
sight the Scarecrow was, in a Bishop's cassock and apron, with ashovel
hat; stuffed with old acts of parliament, and brimstone matches for
fingers.
At first, not one of the original rooks ventured out of his little
corner. You might see them in thousands, sitting on the rails round
it, turning their heads on one side, looking now down at some tremen-
dous slug, and anon up at the hideous Scarecrow. At last, one
banished bird, bolder than the rest, hopped a few feet into the for-
bidden ground, lured by a most tempting worm, which he secured
thoughin agonies of fear that “Pains and Penalties” would be upon him
every moment. Seeing that the Scarecrow remained as it was—its
rags shaking in the wind, and the old parchments fluttering harmlessly |
out at its knees and elbows, he took courage, and next day repeated
his inroad without any mischief. His example was followed; and, as
the slugs and grubs were very abundant, all the old colony were soon
at work in the forbidden territory, and the Scarecrow ceased to have
any terror for them; nay, they would often perch upon it, and befoul
it, and peck away under its very shadow, and steal bits of its old stuffing
for their nests.
Upon this the Jackdaw one day in the parliament of the birds pro-
posed that the Scarecrow should be taken down. It was an ugly
thing, he said, and his last brood had contained one little wretch far
too like the image to be pleasant to his feelings as a father. Besides,
it clearly served no purpose, except to keep alive unpleasant recollec-
tions. It did not frighten away the original rooks, who did more good
than harm by keeping the ground clean, when their successors were
too lazy to do so themselves. “Take it down 1" quoth an old Raven,
the Home Secretary of the birds; “who ever heard the like * Why,
the whole colony of established Rooks would instantly be ruined.--We
should have the original birds eating every grain in the field.” And
as he said this, he winked at the Jackdaw:—“Caw, caw, caw,” screamed
the established Rooks, in a chorus of satisfaction. “The Scarecrow:
Thé Scarecrow ! It's our safeguard; our defence 1 Caw caw
caw I’” The Raven then turned slyly to the Jackdaw, and whispered,
“You fool!' why make a fuss about the Scarecrow 2 it does no one
any harm, because no one minds it. Let it stay where it is. It will
tumble down of itselfin a year or two. The established Rooks must be
respected. Leave them their Scarecrow.” And the old Raven
chuckled very drily, and dined that very day with the patriarch of the
intruders, and was blessed by him as the saviour of the Rook establish-

PARTING PRESENTS.
We believe it is the intention of the League, previous to its dissolu-
tion, to present a testimonial to Mrs. Gamp and Mrs. Harris for the
great service they have done to the cause of Free Trade by writing
with such undaunted energy for so many years against it. We are
glad to perceive that in the hour of triumph old friends are not for-
gotten, and that their real talent has at last been fully recognised. We
owe Mrs. G. and Mrs. H. many a little favour, and are anxious to repay
it. We suggest, therefore, that the testimonial—to do the thing hand-
somely—should be a couple of wet blankets.
The Intense Eleat.
The heat has been so intense in Ireland that it has nearly melted
away the whole of the Repeal Fund. The Rent is oozing in large drops
every week. If the present warmth continues, the dissolution of Repeal
is certain. The heat has lately been so intense that an enormous split
has taken place in Conciliation Hall. O'Connell has tried to cement
it once or twice, but it is no sooner made up in one place than it
breaks out in another.
A NICE QUESTION.
A correspondent wishes to know whether the rejection of the
“Charitable Trusts Bill” will in any way affect the credit given by
tailors to some of their poorer customers. We recommend him to
take counsel's opinion on the point as soon as possible.
LAMENTABLE DESTITUTION--
Now that Sir Robert Peel has retired, the question is, What will
become of Disraeli He must attack somebody. For the want of
a victim, we should not be surprised if he turned round and abused
himself. He could not possibly have a better subject.

T H E S N O B S OF E N G LAN D.
BY ONE OF THEMSELVES.
CHAPTER XX.
ON CONSERVATIVE OR COUNTRY-PARTY SNOBS.
N the whole Court of KING CHARLEs there was no
more chivalrous and loyal a Conservative than
SIR. GeoFFREY HUDsoN, Knight ; who, though
not much better than a puppy dog, was as brave
as the biggest lion, and was ready to fight any
body of any stature. Of the same valour and in-
trepidity was the ingenious hidalgo DoN QUIxote,
of la Mancha, who would level his lance, cry his
war-cry, and gallop at a windmill, if he mistook
it for a giant or any other nuisance ; and though
nobody ever said that the Don's wits were of
the sound order—every one acknowledged his
N courage and constancy, his gentle bearing and
A purity of purpose.
9 We all of us have a compassionate sweetness of
temper for all half-witted persons—for all
ludicrous poor dwarfs engaged in enterprises,
utterly beyond their ability; for all poor blind,
cracked, homest idiots, who fancy that they are
heroes or commanders or emperors or champions
—when they are only a little way removed from a
strait-waistcoat, and barely tolerated at large.
In regard of Political Snobs, the more I consider them the more
this feeling of compassion predominates, until, were all the papers
upon Snobs to be written in the same key, we should have, instead of
a lively and facetious series of essays, a collection that would draw
tears even from undertakers, and would be about as jovial as Doctor
DoDD’s “Prison Thoughts” or LAw's “Serious Call.” We cannot
afford (I think) to scorn and laugh at Political Snobs ; only to pity
them. There is PEEL. If ever there was a Political Snob—a dealer
in cant and common-places—an upholder of shams and a pompous
declaimer of humbugs—Heaven knows he was a Snob. But he repents
and shows signs of grace : he comes down on his knees and confesses
his errors so meekly, that we are melted at once. We take him into
our arms and say, “Bobby, my boy, let bygones be bygones, it is
never too late to repent. Come and join us, and don't make Latin
quotations, or vent claptraps about your own virtue and consistency;
or steal anybody's clothes any more. We receive him, and protect
him from the Snobs, his ex-companions, who are howling without,
and he is as safe in Judy's arms as in his mamma's.
Then there are the Whigs. They rejoice in power; they have got
what they panted for—that possession in Downing Street for which,
to hear some of them, you would have fancied they were destined by
Heaven. Well—now they are in place—to do them justice, they are
comporting themselves with much meekness. They are giving a share
of their good things to Catholics as well as Protestants. They don't say
“No Irish need apply,” but enliven the Cabinet with a tolerable
sprinkling of the brogue. Lord John comes before his constituents
with a humble and contrite air, and seems to say, “Gentlemen :
Although the Whigs are great, there is something, after all, greater—
I mean the People ; whose servants we have the honour to be, and
for whose welfare we promise to look zealously.” Under such dispo-
sitions, who can be angry with Whig Snobs 2—only a misanthropic
ruffian who never took in a drop of the milk of human kindness.
Finally, there are the Conservative, or—as the poor devils call them-
selves now—the Country-party Snobs. Can anybody be angry with
them 2 Can any one consider DoN QUIxote an accountable being, or
alarmed by GeoFFREY HUDsoN's demeanour when he arms in a fury
and threatens to run you through 2
I had gone down last week (for the purpose of meditating at ease
and in fresh air, upon our great subject of Snobs) to a secluded spot
called the Trafalgar Hotel, at Greenwich, when, interrupted by the
arrival of many scores of most wholesome-looking men, in red faces

Let the honest creatures cry out “No Surrender 1" and let us laugh
as we are winning, and listen to them in good humour. We know
what “No Surrender" means—any time these fifteen years. “It is
the nature of the popular bellua,” says the dear old Quarterly Rerieuc,
with its usual grace, and polite felicity of illustration, “never to be

thrown to it.”
the poor devils whom the old Quarterly represents have had to feed
the popular bellua–as anybody may see who reads the periodical in
question. “No Surrender 1" bellows the Quarterly, but Bellua demands
a Catholic Emancipation Act, and bolts it, and is not satisfied—a

A NEW SHOWER BATH.
WHEN a thing is neither ornamental nor useful, there is only one
course left : namely, to clear it away. Such must be the fate of the
Trafalgar Fountains, if their ugliness is not speedily redeemed by
something like utility. The time will never come when the ridiculing
* Flocks shall leave the Fountains,”
as long as they are in their present unprofitable, as well as unsightly
state ; and we have, therefore, a grand design in contemplation by
which those
“Who came to sneer will stop to bathe.”
We propose, therefore, that an awning should be thrown over the
fountains during the summer months, which will, at all events, have
the excellent effect of making the contemptible pile invisible, while the
interior could be allowed to serve as a shower-bath, at a penny a head,
for our old friends “the million.” The two illustrations annexed will
furnish a good idea of our intention ; and even if the shower-bath plan
should fail, we are quite convinced that the plan of covering in the
fountains with a tent will be considered a wonderful improvement to
the present most unsightly “finest site in Europe.”

“WHO IS MR. COBDEN ?”
This is a question that Mrs. Gamp, standing up in her pattens, has
indignantly put to the echoes of Shoe Lane ! “Who is Mr. Cobden 2"
cries the Hera'd, and the echoes not deigning a satisfactory reply,
Mrs. G. proceeds straightway to answer herself in the following words;
with apparently increasing indignation at the extent of her knowledge.
Never was old woman so confounded by her own powers of infor
mation |
“And wrho is Mr. Cobden, and trhat has he done? HE is the son of A Sussex

Should LADY Gordon publish a volume of the Lires of English
Criminals, the life of Richard Cobden must, of course, be therein
printed in the fullest-faced type and in the blackest ink. Indeed, we
are aghast at the dreadful iniquity of the delinquent. First, we are
struck by the peculiar atrocity of his birth—by the greater lump of
original sin which it was the fate of the wretched infant to bring with
him into the world. Consider it—ponder on it. “He is the son of a
Sussex Farmer ' " Were he the son of a burglar—could we even
trace the descent of Richard Cobden down a line of highwaymen be-
ginning with RICHARD TURPIN–there might be some sort of alkali
wherewith to wash the moral blackamoor ; tome sort of fullers'-earth
to take out the hempen stain. But—“the son of a farmer 1" Why,
CAIN was the son of an agriculturist ; and CAIN murdered ABEL–and
Cobden, though he could not knock out the brains of Protection, has
slaughtered the Corn-Law CAIN and Cobden l The simultude, as
Mrs. Malaprop would say, strikes us directly.
“The son of a Sussex Farmer ' " An animated clod of the valley !
A base-born thing of heavy clay ! The poetic mind—our own, of
course—is so struck by the earthiness of Cobb EN, as a thing of the
soil, that his birth appears of no more original dignity than the birth
of the first brutes. “The grassy clods now calved,” says Milton ;
and Cobden was no doubt originally such a calf from such a clod.
How basely different from the born aristocrat, who comes into the
world with a bound and a roar :
“The tawny lion, pawing to get free
His hinder parts, then springs as broke from bonds,
And rampant shakes his brinded mane . "
The born calf is the Leaguer, and the rampant lion is some mighty
LoRD John, who, addressing the citizens of London, disgraces his
brinded mane and switching tail by basely confessing that he has been
taught free-trade lowings by the original Sussex clod. That such
lions—like the china lions on our mantel-pieces—made of the very
finest loam, should ever disgrace themselves by learning anything
from calves sprung from “stiff clay !” Who can wonder at the indig-
nation of Mrs. Gamp But—(if we can pluck up courage)—let us
proceed.
Cobden, with a depravity of mind that will for all ages distinguish
him in the history of human wickedness, not content with his original
baseness, seeks, by turning “calico printer,” a deeper infamy. The
Sussex clay would fain become Manchester mud. Cobden is allowed
to have his wicked will, and absolutely, and with malice aforethought,
and not having the fear of Mrs. Gamp before his eyes—“prints
calico 1" Of printed calico—(we hazard the assertion with the like
diffidence that the DUKE of CAMBRIDGE spoke of potatoes, “believing
we are right")—of printed calico gowns are made. Now, we pass
the mischief that gowns have brought, and are every day bringing
upon the world ; though Mrs. Gamp might speculate upon the many
ºr hearts that Cobden has helped to break with his coloured patterns—
we pass this, to contemplate the low and earthy ends of the man, for
there is little doubt that Cobden's calico may be found upon what
Mrs. Gamp would call the offal of society. Our own housemaid (we
keep a housemaid) may, at this moment, have the Manchester sins of
Cobden on her back And this man, this individual, who helps to
clothe housemaids, to dare to rise up against the DUKE of BUCKING-
HAM—to darken and entirely wrap up the jewel blaze of a coronet in a
rag of printed cotton Well, the cut-purse Claudius with the precious
diadem of Denmark in his pocket, is a royal thief, and therefore to be
respected ; Blood, with the crown of England under his cloak, is
nevertheless an officer and a gentleman ; Jack Shepherd himself, on his
own avowal, “though a thief, never told a lie,” and therefore when he
swung at Tyburn (“the blossom that hung on the bough "), hung
there, a miracle of veracity—but Cobden, the born clod and trans-
formed calico-printer, he to stand up against Protection Peers, and

beat them, too—our iron pen glows red hot with indignation, and the
ink that should trace syllables of loathing and contempt, dries up,
hissing its scorn 1
Well, as an illustrious biographer has observed, “We next meet our
hero,” not “cheapening a pair of highlows in Monmouth Street”—
but nevertheless sitting with BENJAMIN Dish AELI in the House of
Commons. And here he tops all his former atrocities, for he not only
opposes the Corn Laws ; he not only fights for their destruction, but
—he succeeds ! And who can pardon success * Neither the Mrs.
Gamps in black bonnets—nor the Mrs. Gamps in coronets. The cackling
is of the same kind, whether arising from amid the bowers of Stowe
or from the muck and mist of Shoe Lane.
And Cobden is, after all, the son of a Sussex farmer, who preferred,
the trade of a calico-printer
Directly that this truth flashed upon us from the sun-bright type
of the Herald (so very “dark with excess of light"), we felt a sense
of personal injury. For we had witnessed the ceremony of the disso-
lution of the League. We had seen this CoBDEN ; and his calm,
unostentatious bearing—(he, the bloodless victor of giant prejudice,
of ruthless wrong, of ignorance in its darkness only doing evil)—his
noble simplicity, his outward gentleness, when his heart must have
been beating like a drum with a sense of his immortal triumph, had
in it something sublime, affecting; when we thought what his conquest
was—what an example it set to all the nations—what fruits of plenty
grown in universal peace it promised to unborn millions. We heard
him pronounce the funeral oration of the League. And he spoke of
its doings with the wisdom of a sage, and the gentleness of a child.
His note of triumph had not the braying of vulgar conquest—it was
not glory achieved by ball and steel, and flourished by vocal brass—
but it was the triumph of humanity, speaking from its overflow of
heart; of achieved happiness for the whole human race. It was the
voice of honesty, pure and simple, and free in its effusion as water
from a rock. Commerce made free throughout the world, would use
her unbound hands to bind the bully war. Such, oh, Horse Guards !
despite your shining helmets, and your tails of equine hair, will
unbound Commerce do And as Cobden spoke of universal peace
assured by universal trade, the imagination heard a wail from the iron
bowels of Woolwich Arsenal, and saw portentous clouds gather over
that delicious spot—now fragrant with saltpetre—devoted to rocket-
practice And still as Cobden spoke, and as the League was dis-
solving fast—its great end gloriously, because peacefully, accomplished
—sure we are that every corn field waved more beautifully beneath
the all-encircling heavens; whose impartial bounty shed upon all men,
should teach all that they are of one family—created to assist, esteem,
and live in peace with one another. And this glorious lesson (never to
be taught by schoolmasters with bullion on their shoulders) will, ulti-
mately be taught by Free Trade. Such were the thoughts, such
the belief that the last oration of Richard Cobden awakened in us,
| listening.
And now we learn that—“HE Is THE son of A Sussex FARMER,
who PREFERRED THE TRADE of A CALIco-PRINTER.” We feel that we
have been grossly insulted.
PUNCH'S DEMANDS ON THE NEW MINISTRY.
oNCElving that we have as good a right as
MR. O'ConnELL to say what we expect
of the Ministry, we have prepared a pro-
gramme of measures which we purpose
sending in, by the next post, to the head
of the Government. The Irish Agitator
is a great deal more unreasonable than we
are, for he asks a variety of things that
are impracticable, whereas we confine our
requests to a very limited catalogue of
, measures, all of which can be accomplished
A with the greatest ease in the world. We
will not compromise ourselves in themanner
that O'Connell has done, by promising
that if we get what we now seek we will
hold our tongues in future about the
measure we think indispensable to the happiness and welfare of our
country. We, on the contrary, will only pledge ourselves to conditional
quietude, for if we are not satisfied when we get all we desired, we give
timely notice that we shall very probably want something more. We
recommend Load John Russell, however, to let us have at least an
instalment of our demands—something just to begin with—something,
in fact, to enable us to judge how we like that for which we have
thought proper to ask.
The following is a short statement of a few of the things that Punch
intends to insist upon from the new Government:—
d A Bill to Facilitate the getting along Fleet Street at all hours of the
ay.
A Bill to provide for the placing of the DUKE of WELLINGTON on a
better footing with the public, than the one selected at the top of
Constitution Hill.
A Bill for the total abolition of Trafalgar Square.
A Bill to provide handsomely for ourselves, and every one belonging
to us.
A Bill for allowing a drawback on the brandy used in brandy-balls.
A Bill for taking the taxes off everything except Patience, Ingenuity,
Memory, and other similar articles.
A Bill for inquiring into the fine points of Chartism, and ascertaining
what relation they bear to points at cribbage.
Animals' Friend Society.
Forests at the West End of the Town.
A Bill for making MR. BRIEFLEss Lord Chancellor, with the power
of appointing a deputy at a thousand a-year.
When we have had some experience of one or two of these measures,
we shall make up our minds whether to give our confidence and support
to the new Government.
Any applications from the Members of the Ministry must be directed
to the Punch Office, and will not be taken in unless the postage has
been previously paid.
THE CHURCH MILITANT.
A correspond ENT of the Times has called
attention, under this head, to the practice of
making parsons into Deputy-lieutenants of
| counties. The office of the latter being
military, it is naturally asked whether these
pious and pugnacious people are considered
qualified “for any situation, civil, military,
or ecclesiastical?” When we consider that
it is the practice of Deputy-lieutenants to
appear in uniform, it becomes a matter of
serious import that the parson should not
be entirely lost sight of in the soldier; and
we therefore have to suggest a mixed
| costume, combining the clerical and the
military in as great a degree as possible.
The shovel hat might be set off to advan-
tage by the streaming feather, and the ºs
formally-cut coat could be easily improved
by the addition of the belt and gorget of
the soldier. We liberally place at the dis-
|posal of any clerico-military tailor, the
accompanying sketch for the costume of
reverend Deputy-lieutenants, who are
becoming a very fashionable article of
manufacture, for the Lord-lieutenant of
Somerset has made two within the last fort-
night.

sinecure in the Cabinet, namely, that of the

SHEwBTH. That Your Petitioners belong to a class of persons from
whom, at Colleges and Institutions for the advancement of Science
and Literature, Lecturers and other Teachers are selected :
That such individuals, in their official capacity, are commonly styled
Professors :
| That certain other individuals, in divers advertisements, and in sundry
bills, placards, and posters, have of late assumed and added to
their names the title or appellation of Professor; and that by the
said appellation or title of Professor they have procured themselves
to be commonly called and known :
That of these individuals, some are teachers of dancing, others fiddlers,
and others posture-masters, not to say mountebanks ; that others
of them, again, are Professors of pills and ointment, and that one
of them hath lately announced himself to the world as Professor of
a ventilating peruke :
That, from thus serving to denote dancing-masters, and fiddlers, and
players of monkeys' tricks, and quack-salvers, and barbers, the
name of Professor hath acquired a significancy which rendereth it
anything but a creditable one.
Your Petitioners, therefore, have humbly to request that you will find
some other title for your Lecturers and Teachers than this same
denomination of Professor ; which your said Petitioners do object
to share with the kind of persons above mentioned.

A shower of Frogs.
AN account of a shower of frogs, which “darkened the atmosphere
for miles,” has appeared in the newspapers. We have noticed that
this shower is very periodical in its appearance—that the frogs always
come down about once every quarter of a year. We can only account
for it by supposing. that the paragraph is always kept standing, and
that when the Editor of a country newspaper has the corner of a column
to fill up which is not large enough to admit of “An Enormous Goose-
berry,” he calls out to the compositors, “Here, somebody bring me a

Mahometan father, has addressed a letter to Punch, begging to know

THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
M I SS R O B J N S O N C R U S O E.
CHAPTER III.
| CoNTINUED to walk about on
the shore, much wondering
at the fortune that had saved
me, and grateful to my own
discernment, that at Margate
had prompted me to shun the
meaner pleasures of the place,
to learn to swim. And then
I suffered alternations of
happiness and despair. I
thought of my female com-
rades ; and believing them
to be in the deep, all thoughts
of rivalry charitably died
within me. I thought of
ardent hair and irregularity
of teeth with a pity—a sym-
pathy that surprised me. So true it is that no trouble, however great,
has not, in the core of its very greatness, some drop of comfort—(for the
human heart, like a bee, will gather honey from poisonous blossoms)–
that from my very solitude I snatched a triumph. Should I meet an
Indian prince—and, for what I knew, I might be in the empire of the
Mogul—there was no lady to contest with me his royal affections.
And again, this feeling was saddened by the thought that no other
woman could witness my conquest. For all my acquaintance were
gone; I never saw them, or any sign of them afterwards, except a
jaconet muslin nightcap (the horrid pattern I) and a wave-tossed
rouge-pot.
And still my feelings of satisfaction began to abate, for looking
about me, I saw no habitation ; and though I listened—my sense of
hearing sharpened by my peril—I heard not the sound of a muffin-
bell. I therefore concluded that I was in a land to which the blessings
of civilisation were utterly unknown. And besides this, I began to
feel that my feet were very wet ; and—though I struggled long—I at
length burst into tears when I thought of my evening blue buried
in the bosom of the deep. And then I began to have confused feelings
of hunger. A sea-bird screamed in the distance, and I thought of the
liver wing of a chicken. This threw me into terrible disorder. Only
that I knew nobody was there to catch me, or what could I have done
but faint 2
As a child, I always screamed at a spider. As a woman—I throw
myself upon the sympathy of my sex—though fond of milk, I always
ran into the first shop or door-way, or grasped the first arm of the
first gentleman on meeting even a cow. What, then, were my feelings
when I thought of wild beasts —beasts that revenged the wrongs of
the beasts in cages, by eating the unprotected travellers on their
shores 2 I had read horrid tales of bears and apes ; and when I re-
membered I had nothing but a pair of scissors (with one point blunt
too) to protect me, how I wept—how I repented of my folly, that had
brought me in search of a military husband, coming in a boat with
cocoa-nuts and yams, to perish at last, perhaps, in the claws of some
wild and foreign animal.
Daylight, as if in mockery of my terrors, waned fast away. Where
was I to sleep 2 That I, who at the least dusk had never walked from
number nine to the THoMPsons’ at number six, without the man or the
maid—that I should sleep out all night, I knew not where, shocked
me past words to paint l Respectability seemed sinking with the sun 1
Suddenly, I heard a sound—whether the voice of a tiger or a frog I
knew not ; but equally alarmed, Iran to a tree. Instinctively looking
about to see that nobody observed me—and, for the moment, (silly
creature that I was,) thinking only of the country stiles of happy
England—I put one foot upon the lowest bough, and with an agility
that surprised even myself, continued to climb. At length I threw
myself into the umbrageous arms of a young hawthorn, and prepared
myself for rest. I put one peppermint drop in my mouth, and soon
sank to sleep. Even at this lapse of time I wonder at myself; but
I never even thought—vain as the thought would have been—of
paper for curling my hair.
I awoke, as usual, about eleven o'clock. It was a love of a day.
The sun shone beautifully hot, and the sea was like a looking-glass.
For the first few minutes—ere fully awake—I thought I was at Mar-
gate ; and, so were images mixed and confused, that as the small
shingle was moved and shaken by the advancing and receding wave,
I thought I heard the rattling of the library dice. Moving, a sharp
thorn—the tree was full of them—brought me, as adversity lowers
pride, instantly to myself. With a heavy heart I descended the tree,
feeling it vain to wait for the breakfast bell. Again and again I looked
around me—I was such a figure It was foolish, weak ; but never-
theless, it showed the beauty of the female character. I dreaded lest
even some savage should see me in my horrible déshabille. And then
—though my nobler reason told me it could not be so—I shrank at
every motion of the sea and air, lest the Indian prince, or general
officer, should suddenly rise before me, and then—in such a dress what
would he think of me? In such a state, it seemed to me a blessing
when I could really think that I was upon a desert island, all alone !
Solitude was bad, but to be caught with my hair in such a fright—
with all my flounces limp (much starch was then worn,) and my gown
as though waxed about me—I felt it, I should have died upon the
beach. -
After a time my pride abated as my hunger rose. I could not have
believed it, but I thought less of my hair and more of my breakfast.
A lesson to human arrogance,—for did I ever believe that the human
soul could so have hungered for a twopenny twist I walked upon
the beach : it was strewed with oysters. Nevertheless, though there
were thousands about me, it was June, and I knew that oysters were
not in. “At least,” I thought, “and whatever fate in its bitterness
may have in store for me, as I have lived in the fashion, in the
fashion I'll expire.” And this determination—mere men cannot con-
ceive its deliciousness—comforted me exceedingly. Nevertheless—for
I write down here every then emotion of my soul—though I abhorred
the thought of oysters in June as food, I could not forget them as
the probable depositaries of precious pearls. Famished and destitute,
I thought, being in the Indian seas—as I believed I was—I might be
destined to be one of those lucky people of the world, who have pearls
washed ashore at their feet, and never run the risk of diving for them.
Though I was as hungry as the sea, the thought like a sunbeam
played about me, that I might be destined to wear my own head-
dress of pearls, obtained from the living fish by my own hands, at
some future drawing-room ' And whilst I thought this, my hunger
was in abeyance 1 CLEOPATRA dissolved her pearl, as ill-nature
dissolves the treasures of life, in vinegar; but I enriched my pearls by
honied thoughts. (What would I give had either of the Misses
WHALEBone, principals of the Blackheath Seminary, lived to read
this—this from their pupil ')
* I continued, with my footsteps, to print the sand. And shall I
confess to what I believe is what is called an association of ideas, as
taught me by my venerable father ? Bear with the weakness, the
affections of a daughter, whilst I speak of it. “My dear girl,” said
that revered man to me, “I’ll tell you what is meant by 'sociation of
ideas. Thus it is, as it happens to your blessed father. When, at
about ten at night, your mother—darning a stocking, or what not.—
looks up, full at me—I can't help it—I think of a lemon; then I think
of whisky—whisky leads me on to a glass—a glass goes to nothing
but hot water—hot water cries out sugar—sugar asks for a spoon ;
and before you can say “Jack Robinson’—the name of your blessed
ancestor, who was a very quick chap, and came over with the Nor-
mans—I say to your mother, and all beginning with the lemon of
her looking at me, “my dear; the toddy!” And this, my darling girl,
is the 'sociation of ideas l’”
And, in this way, as my footsteps printed the sand, so was I
resolved—if ever rescued from that desert island—to print my
thoughts and sufferings whilst living upon it. To this resolution I
will hold, as shall be shown in succeeding chapters.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE VENTILATING GUY FAUX.
By the recent ejection of DR. REID
from the houses of Parliament we are
reminded of the happy frustration of the
plot of Guy FAUx and his desperate as-
sociates. The ventilating Guy was on
the point of carrying his project into
execution, when Lord MonTEAGLE, like
his predecessor in the title, received an
anonymous letter, intimating that the
Legislature would all be blown up if
some caution were not exercised. Upon
this an inquiry took place, and the new
buildings being searched were found to
be entirely undermined by the most
fearful apparatus, which was ready for
the striking of the fatal blow on the first
opportunity. The effect would have
been dreadful, as the annexed sketch
fully exemplifies. The Guy would cer-
tainly have effected his object but for
his own want of energy in carrying out
his purpose, and his attempts to put it
in force against some of the judges, in
whose courts repeated explosions were
heard, which led to inquiry, when it
was found that Reid was at the bottom
of the business. The date of Reid's
exclusion from the house will, we hope,
be celebrated in the same manner as the
Fifth of November, with the substitution
of air balloons for fireworks.

#brahim ºutfla Dining Out.
DURING the early part of IBRAHIM's
visit to this country, every one seemed
disposed to cut him; but now every one
seems inclined to ask him to dinner,
and instead of the “cold shoulder,” he
gets every delicacy that the season can
afford. The Reform Club deserves praise
for having been the first to show this
piece of attention to the illustrious
stranger, though it was rather too bad
to place him next to SIR. C. NAPIER who
had bothered him at Beyrout—so called
probably from its having been the scene
of the routing of some Bey—and next
but one to Lord PALMERston who, as
Foreign Minister, put poor Pacha into
a desperate flight by an adverse policy.
Nevertheless, the dinner at the Rºſº -Bºi.
Club was a compliment; and if his dat Sºlū
qui cito dat is applicable to dinners B sº
as well as everything else, the Reform Zºº
Club dinner was equal to a couple of
meals, by the promptitude with which it
was offered to the “impetuous IBRAHIM.”
The bill of fare must have proved
exceedingly puzzling to the guest of
the evening, who can hardly have acquired, during his sojourn in the French capital, a
sufficient acquaintance with the language to have assisted him in translating the dishes
into intelligible terms. Of the sixteen soups, the four à la Comte de Paris aux Légumes Prin-
taniers, may have been within IBRAHIM's comprehension, though we confess it is beyond
ours! for how the heir-apparent to the French throne, surrounded by spring vegetables,
can give any notion of a potage, we are totally at a loss to conceive.
We can better understand the Quatre capons à la Nelson, which we suppose consisted
of four capons with the white feather entirely suppressed; or if the birds were really
à la the Hero of the Nile they would, of course, plume themselves on being without
this one dishonourable plume. The “Four Turbans smoked into an Epigram,” which
we presume to be a free translation of “Quatre Turbans Epigramme au fumée,” must
have been intended as a good-natured quiz upon the Eastern fashion of wearing turbans.
The “Quatre cotelettes en surprise à la Reforme” —“four chops in surprise at the Reform,”
we take to have been the most natural dish of the whole lot, for the chops may well
have been surprised at the speed with which they were devoured.
We think it would be as well that Monsieur SoYER, whose inventive genius devises
all these delicacies, as well as their names—should publish, with every bill of fare, a
translation of the title into English ; and perhaps it might be still more satisfactory if
he would add a chemical analysis of the ingredients, for the benefit of those who are de-

sirous of knowing what they are eating. This, how-
ever, is a class which, in these days of culinary
science, has probably become very limited; for the
advance of cookery has confounded all distinctions
of alimentary matter, and the viands, as well as
the guests, are often equally a la surprise.

A PLEA FOR PLUSH.
Belgravia, July 1, 1846.
DEAR SIR, Having observed
on several occasions in
your paper a tone of
kindly feeling expressed
towards the JEAMEs Es
of the metropolis, I
desire to call the atten-
tion of the public,
through your means,
to an instance of exces-
sive cruelty which is
daily practised by a
heartless Duchess, who
resides in this parish,
towards several of the
finest specimens of
humanity which it has
ever been my good
fortune to behold.
“You must recollect, Mr. Punch, the state of the thermometer during
the past month—generally between eighty and ninety degrees in the
shade. Well, sir, during the whole of that fiery season, the merciless
woman whom I am anxious to expose, kept four of her fellow-creatures
daily encased in close-fitting garments of scarlet Plush | | | They wear
them still.
“It makes my heart bleed to witness the protracted sufferings of
these large, plethoric men; one of them a Hall Porter, of mature age
and startling obesity. There they stand, on the steps before the street
door, making passers-by wink and nursery-maids blush at the splendour
of their attire—white, scarlet, and gold—perspiring exceedingly, and
irritated to madness by the blue-bottle flies and impudent little boys
of the vicinity, who unceasingly exclaim, with exasperating monotony,
“I say, BLAzes, vy don't you buy a Wenham 'frigerator f' |
“I have ascertained, with grief, Mr. Punch, that these unfortunate
men have little or no hard work to do, that all their messages are per-
formed by deputy; they get their five meals a day—with beer—regular,
besides snacks, and I feel convinced, that if the hot weather lasts, unless
they are indulged with some light genteel occupation, and in the man-
keen shorts, (which have latterly been introduced with great success
by several benevolent ladies of rank in the neighbourhood) the wretched
creatures will inevitably be struck down by apoplexy on the hall steps
on which they are so barbarously exposed every day from two till seven.
“I have the honour to remain, Sir,
“Your obedient servant,
“*1\opAvvrms.”
We readily give admission to our correspondent's benevolent remon-
strance in behalf of the injured Plush family. But if he had seen, as
we did, at the DUCHEss of Douche's déjéuner, (where the rain came
down in torrents, and the breakfast was served under a mackintosh
marquee,) the dripping condition of several of the nobility's footmen
who sported the new summer nankeen lower uniform, blºopNvvkms
would acknowledge, that in our variable climate PLUSH is, after all, a
better stuff than nankeen for the breeches of a British footman.
MIND Your Eye-somebody has been comparing SIR Robert PEEL
to PolyPHEMUs—his most prominent feature being his enormous “I.”
THE BOY BROUGHAM.
“He shall go to Vauxhall—HE shall—HE shall !”
#5 WE are delighted to find that the continued activity of LoBD
BRough AM, so far from telling upon his mind and body, has rendered
him really a much younger man than he was several years ago. The
yearning of the song-writer who expressed his vain desire to be “a boy
again,” has been realised in the case of the Ex-Ex-Ex-Chancellor, who
is now, by-the-bye, literally the treble X Chancellor, for there have
been ten administrations since the days when he used to write to his
sovereign by the General Post “a long time ago.” It is, however,
most refreshing to hear the accounts of Lord BRough AM's juvenility
after so long a period devoted to the service of the public and of
himself.
We find him foremost in all the 'pursuits and pleasures of youth,
from the boar-hunt at Cannes, to the juvenile fêtes at Vauxhall
Gardens. On the last occasion of a grand gala for the little folks
home for the holidays, the name of Lord BRough AM was first in the
list of visitors. We do not grudge him his infantine diversions, and
are exceedingly gratified to perceive that an old boy can be still as
much a boy as the youngest amongst them. We are happy also to
find that a state of second childhood is not insensible to all the amuse-
ments which we take pleasure in during the first gush of youthful
buoyancy. We cannot do less on this occasion than celebrate it in the
fresh language of immortal and always juvenile poesy :-
BRough'M is still a little boy;
Heigho, heighol
Pleased with every novel toy;
Heigho, heighol
Seeing an advertisement,
Like a child on pleasure bent,
He to the juv'nile gala went ;
Heigho, heighol
BROUGH'M became at last a man ;
Heigho, heighol
And a very noisy one;
Heigho, heighol
He took a politician's part,
At the Woolsack made a dart,
And reach'd it—but was made depart;
Heigho, heighol
BROUGH'M we thought was getting old,
Heigho, heigho
But we've been regularly sold;
Heigho, heighol
If he should live to ninety-two,
He'd play the boy, as urchins do;
I'm sure I think he would—don't you?
Heigho, heigho

LONDON
LEAVING TOWN.
EveRY onE hears that at this period of the year all London goes out
of town; but it is difficult to form a very correct idea of the actual
appearance of that ordinary annual movement. We have therefore
the pleasure of presenting the public with a sketch taken from the top
of the Monument by an enthusiastic follower of High Art, showing
the ex-urban progress of the various locomotives, steamers and
vehicles along the roads, the rails, and the river.
The plate is given more as a memento of an annual “great fact"
than on account of its intrinsic value as a piece of drawing. The
artist is anxious to impress upon the public mind his desire not to be
judged by this specimen of his powers, which is merely an attempt to
catch as they fly the various moving machines that take the metropolis
beyond itself at this sea-sidean season.

The metropolitan public will be de-
lighted to hear that the abode of bliss
is within a sixpenny fare of London,
and may be reached by omnibus at
least thirty times a day. The an-
nouncement will cause no less satis-
faction than surprise, when we are
enabled to state that Elysium is in
Thistle Grove, Old Brompton, and
that it will be submitted to public
competition at the Auction Mart, on
- the 30th of July.
We had no idea, until we perused
the advertisement of MR. GEORGE
RoPINs, how comparatively economically a terrestrial paradise can be
formed. The chief characteristic of the Elysium which MR. GEORGE
Robins has announced for sale is, that “the doors of the drawing-room
are distinguished by plate glass.” We had no idea, until we saw this
paragraph, that Paradise, like a large linen-draper's establishment,
depends much upon its decorations. It is also a most refreshing fact that
Elysium stands within the small compass of less than an acre of ground.
It is not surprising that some restrictions should be attached to the
enjoyment of Elysium, and we think it, on the whole, a very moderate
condition that the fixtures must be taken at a valuation, and the
planned furniture is imperative. The only unaccountable portion of the
matter is, that the present proprietor of Elysium should be willing to
part with the invaluable treasure he possesses.

THE labours of HERCULEs are nothing to those of IBRAHIM PAchA.
How he can find time to eat his meals, or to dress, much less to sleep,
is a mystery to us. He attends shops, routs, political meetings, fêtes,
penny shows, with all the ardour of a German Prince who comes over
for six days to write a book on “England and the English.” The
Pacha is indefatigable. His appetite for pleasure seems only to be
exceeded by his thirst for business. We have been favoured with a
programme of his Pachaship's movements for the following week.

HOW ABOUT THE OPPOSITION ?
It must be gratifying to Lord George BENTINck to know that we
have now some prospect of a Stable Ministry. LoRD John Russell
appears to have bound up, pretty securely, his bundle of sticks—the
Cabinet, we hope, will excuse the metaphor. There may still, however,
exist considerable doubt as to how the business of the country is to be
carried on. HER MAJESTY, it is true, is provided with Ministers ; but
where is HER MAJESTY's Opposition ? Echo, at a nonplus, repeats the
interrogation. -
The antagonism between the late and present PREMIER has been
converted into resemblance : they now correspond to the Pompey and
CAESAR, not of Roman History, but of Nigger anecdote. “Pompey and
CAEsAR very much alike, especially Pompey.” It is really to be
feared that there will be an end to party'ſ strife; and, of course, to
the excitement and fun of politics. The difficulty, perhaps, will be less
felt in the House of Lords, where Lord BRough AM will be an Oppo-
sition in himself; but who will impede legislation in the House of
.." * The fact is, that Punch must become a Member of Par-
iament.

The LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
M I SS R O B | N S O N C R U S O E.
CHAPTER IV.
WALKING on, I raised my eyes, and what was my astonishment, my
delight, to behold the ship—the Ramo Samee—reclining as upon a sofa,
on a bank of sand about two miles distant l My heart fluttered.
After all, I might not be alone upon a desolate island. The captain
might be spared ; if not the captain, at least the boatswain. Again,
when I looked upon the vessel, soft thoughts stole into my bosom ;
hope stirred within me, and all about my plum-coloured silk and my
crimson velvet,_and the band-boxes, every one with a love of a bonnet,
and the night-caps (I was always particular in my night-caps,) with
their beautiful lace borders, chosen with an eye to the hopeful future.
These thoughts forced tears from my eyes; and I resolved to save my
wardrobe ; or, as I once heard a gentleman in blue silk and spangles
exclaim, “perish in the attempt.”
I satiated my hunger with raw periwinkles, for I found they
strewed the lower part of the beach,--which I was enabled to do,
having several pins in my dress. I had never thought of it before ;
but how beautifully has Nature or Fashion, or whatever it may be,
ordained that woman should never be without pins 2 Even as Nature
benevolently guards the rose with thorns, so does she endow woman
with pins; a sharp truth not all unknown to the giddy and frolicsome.
Though dreading to approach my boxes, lest I should discover that
the salt water had spoilt all my things, I nevertheless determined to
visit the ship, and preserve what I could of my beautiful outfit. A
pang shot through my heart when I thought of a certain white satin,
made up—for I had provided against being married unawares in case
of the officer coming off in the yam-boat. Allowing it to be preserved
from the wrathful billows, of what avail would it be in such a place 2
Of what avail, indeed, any of my clothes, for who could see them 2
And when I thought of this, my tears flowed anew.
As I proceeded, my eyes beheld what, at the distance, they believed
to be a monstrous eel. It is a fish I am prodigiously fond of; and I
will own it, for the moment I forgot the horrors of my situation in
the thought of my gratified palate. I ran to seize the prize, when, to
my passing disappointment I discovered that what I thought to be an
eel was nothing more than an india-rubber life-preserver, that had
floated from the vessel. My better feelings were aroused, and I will
not repeat what thanks I uttered for the accident.
Taking off my gown—for the flounces were very (full, and there-
fore would hold much water, I put on the life-preserver, and made for
the ship. It is true I was a good swimmer, and could have gained
the vessel without any foreign aid; but I husbanded my strength, for
I knew not what trials awaited me. Now and then I shivered as a
flying-fish rose before me ; for where flying-fishes were found, there,
I had heard, were sharks ; and my feet were wholly unprotected, the
Adelaide boot being at that time wholly unknown. How strangely
doth fear magnify circumstances ! More than once I screamed at
what I believed I felt to be an alligator, at the very greatest, perhaps,
it was a shrimp. I swam round and round the ship, looking for an
easy place to get up. At length, I saw a bit of rope hanging out of
the captain's window, and—always being a good climber—I was speed-
ily in his cabin. The silence—the solitude appalled me. His pipe
—relinquished when the breeze began to freshen—still lay upon the
table. There was something about that pipe that—I know not why—
affected me.
I crept from cabin to cabin: all was still I sat down upon a bench,
and was buried in reflection. Now my thoughts dwelt upon my sad
condition, and now they wandered to the wardrobe and jewels of the
female passengers : poor things 1 all removed from the toil and
trouble of such vanities. Whilst thus occupied, I felt something rub
against my knee. The thought electrically shot through me—“I am
not alone, then. Is it the captain : is it the boatswain 7" This, I
say, was the thought of a second, and ere I could look about me.
Then, casting my eyes downwards, I beheld a cat—the ship cat.
Now, cats I had always treated with very distinguished contempt ;
believing them, in my maidenly superstition, the inevitable companions
of single wretchedness. And as the animal continued to rub against
me, and stare at me with—as somebody somewhere says of melan-
choly—its “green and yellow eyes,” and mew and mew, that its voice
thrilled my heart-strings, I thought the creature cried, “Welcome,
Miss Robinson, to old-maidenhood; welcome for ever to celibacy.”
The idea was too much for me. I rose, and running and stumbling,
reached my own cabin. There I found some water, and a bottle of
eau-de-cologne. Equally mixing the liquids in a horn, I drank the
beverage, and was revived considerably. Another and another libation
put new heart into me, and I continued my search from place to place.
My own boxes were safe, and—shall I ever forget the emotion that
swelled my heart—dry. A canary-coloured satin slip was, however,
utterly ruined by the salt-water ; though I thought that probably
the surrounding country might furnish me with materials to dye it
for common.
It was with some natural feelings of curiosity that I rummaged all
the boxes of my late female companions. Could I choose my readers,
I would not hesitate to name the many artifices of millinery that I
discovered; the many falsehoods made of buckram, and wool, and
wadding, and—but no ; far be it from me to put a weapon in the
hands of the male malignant. In every box I found a large supply of
French slippers and shoes : but, of course, they were all much too
big for me.
By dint of great exertion I got all ºthese boxes upon deck. Had
their weight been of anything else than beautiful dresses, I do not
think I could have lifted it. But I know not what it was that put a
mysterious power within me. I carried up trunk upon trunk as
though it had been no more than a Tunbridge Wells work-box.
“How happy,” thought I, “could I be with such a wardrobe, if any-
body could see me wear it !”
In the steward's cabin there were all sorts of pickles and preserves,
guava jelly, and preserved ginger. All these, and fifty other kinds of
pleasant eatables, with—what could have prompted me to take it, I
know not—one bottle of gin, I brought and set down upon the deck.
My next thought was—and for a long time it puzzled me—how to
get them ashore. But this I managed, as the reader shall learn.

THE union of amusement with instruction has become such a very popular notion that the
Admiralty has, we understand, determined on adopting it. In order to introduce among the
junior members of the Naval service a knowledge of their profession, an arrangement has, we
believe, been entered into with MR. T. P. CookE, to give some of those faithful representations
of the character and habits of the British Seaman for which he has long been eminent.
It is in contemplation to obtain his attendance at the various sea-ports in succession, for
the purpose of going through a series of semi-dramatic lectures, in the presence of the
officers and crews of the ships at the different stations. The following is a slight sketch of
the programme of the first of these performances, which will take place at Portsmouth, as
soon as the necessary arrangements are completed :—
PART I.
Introduction to Naval Life—The deck of the Daisy—Anecdote of a Thames Stoker—Young
BEN, the pride of Putney—Song: “I’m Afloat”—Yeo heo-heol—Abaft the binnacle once more
—Life in a paddle-box—Hip, hip, hip, hurrah —“Jack's the boy”—Naval hornpipe, and Off
she goes.
Between the Parts, a Naval Hornpipe.
PART II.
“The Sea, the Sea”—Epsom salts and salt water—Neptune out of tune—Rigs in the rig-
ging—Anecdote of GEoRGE Robins—A Sail! A Sail!—A Dance on deck—“To the Pumps,
to the Pumps”—A Quadrille in the Channel—Channel sole Shoes—Who's for the Shore—
“The Shark and the Shrimp"—The Learned Pig and the Sow Wester—A Sea. Fight—
Hornpipe in character—concluding with
RULE BRITANNIA.
It is intended that the lectures shall be varied as the marine pupils advance, and the whole
science of navigation, illustrated by songs, anecdotes, and hornpipes, will be laid open to the
student. It is confidently anticipated that a perfect British Seaman may be turned out in half-
a-dozen lectures. The room will be fitted up with a mast and rope ladder, so that the illusion
will be as complete as possible.
THE BRITISH AND FOREIGN PRO-SLAVERY SOCIETY.
Morro.—“Pro Catend, Furcá, et Flagello.”
ALL those right-minded and respectable persons who wish for a revival of the “good
old times;” who like to see the common people kept in their proper place, and taught
nothing more than to do as they are bid ; who would have boys flogged, and men hanged,
that deserve it; are invited to co-operate in the formation of an Association now about to be
instituted, to be called THE BRITIsh AND Foreign PRo-SLAVERY Society.
The foundation of this Society has become necessary in order to counteract the machina-
tions of the Anti-Slavery Society for the diffusion, at home and abroad, of the dangerous
principles of Liberty.
The following are the objects for which the Pro-Slavery Society will contend, in utter
defiance of what is styled public opinion :-
1. Agitation for the repeal of the Negro Emancipation Act. Petitions will be circulated
for the pardon of persons convicted of the so-called offence of slave-dealing, and every effort |
will be made for the revival of this important
branch of our national commerce, in which our
slave-holding brethren on the other side of the
Atlantic will be politely requested to unite.
2. The continuance of fagging in public
schools; for the training up of our youth in
habits of servitude.
3. The maintenance of impressment in the
navy, and of corporal punishment in the army,
and the opposition of the fatal and mischievous
scheme of educating the common soldier.
4. The unflinching championship of the game
laws, and the inculcation of the sacredness of the
head of game, and the inviolable privileges of
the lord of the manor.
5. The perpetuation of our glorious gallows,
the true tree of the British Constitution, round
which every member of the Pro-Slavery Society
is exhorted to rally, beseeching the woodman in
spare at least that tree.
Such will be the leading objects of this Society;
and it will aim, generally, at the supp
of enlightenment, and º universal establish-
ment of despotism.
3}rincipleg of the Netu ſāinistry.
A Leader for “The Observer.”
LoRD John Russell having been called upon
in the House of Commons to declare the prin-
ciples on which he will conduct his Government,
we, who are not called upon, and who object to
the principle altogether of premature disclosure,
will state our own views, as far as we can see,
which in the present state of darkness is quite
impossible. In the first place it is probable,
though we do not pledge ourselves, and if we
were pledged we might perhaps be taken in, still
we believe it possible, and indeed anything is
possible to a certain extent, that the Premier
will not attempt more than he thinks he can
accomplish, unless indeed fie overrates his own
powers, when he may be led into such an error.
It is very true that EARL GREY's Adminis-
tration did much that LoRD JoHN RUSSELL can-
not do, because it has been done already; but
we are not prepared to say that, if LoRD John
|RUssRLL had been in EARL GREY's place, which
in fact he is now—but we of course mean then
—he would have acted as that Nobleman did.
Not as he would have done in 1846, but as he
did when he did, which is, in fact, when he should
have done.
This brings us to the Government of LoBD
MELBourne, but we do not know why, or if we
did know why, we should be at a loss to say
how, it would be required of Lord JoHN RUssell
to place himself in a similar position to that of
the other at the very juncture. We mean eight
years ago, when the political aspect was, taking
a similar view of it, altogether different. It is all
very well, by which, of course, we mean it is
highly blameable, for members of Parliament not
in office,—though we do not mean to say they
ought not to be in office, though we defy any
but themselves and their friends to say they
should—to cavil at the new Minister for his
reserve.
If we were at the head of the Government—
though we only put the case for the sake of
argument, but we do not mean to hint that we
would take anything from any administration,
which we never did, though if we had, we are
not sure any one would have a right to complain
except ourselves, at least if we could be so absurd
as to complain of anything for our own advan-
tage—that is, supposing it to be advantageous–
we should certainly, or rather vaguely, furnish a
very imperfect outline of our own intentions.
Such we take to be—as far as we know, but we
again warn our readers to remember that we
really know nothing—the object of the new
Minister.

# 3Letter from ſtieffemet àIt to Ebrajini 39atha.
HE fact is not generally known that
IBRAHIM's rather sudden departure
from this country was occasioned by a
paternal letter, of which we have been
fortunate enough to obtain a copy. It
will be observed that the document is
written in the ordinary style of English
correspondence, for MEHEMET ALI
endeavours to adopt European habits as
far as he possibly can, and, as when in
Rome he would do as Rome does, so his
son, being in this country, is addressed
i. an Englishman. The following is the
etter :—
“MY DEAR Boy,
t “I am getting very uneasy
about your prolonged absence, and I do
not exactly like the way in which you
have been conducting yourself in
England. You have not behaved with
that gentlemanly dignity which would
have been becoming to your station and
dignity. Your stopping at an ordinary
hotel was scarcely agreeable to my
feelings, but if the Government offered
you no better accommodation, there was
no alternative. I am, however, chiefly
annoyed by the eagerness you have shown to enter into a life of gaiety
utterly inconsistent with the dignity of the heir to a highly respectable,
if not very powerful, empire.
“I am also grieved beyond measure at hearing that you made your-
self very conspicuous at a place called Cremorne House, indulging in
jokes at the expense of the Invisible Poet, and behaving very absurdly
towards a highly respectable aeronaut. It was right, perhaps, that you
should endeavour to see as much as you could of Life in London, but I
do not think the Coal-Hole is exactly the place for the son of MEHEMET
ALI. Your dining at the Reform Club was well enough in its way,
but I am given to understand, that the quantity of Champagne you
consumed created a degree of hilarity, which was not decorous, to say
the least of it. Besides, my dear boy, the cost of your trip is much
greater than I expected it would have been. You have already drawn
upon me to a large extent, but if any bill is presented here after that
for sixteen rupees due on the 4th instant, I give you timely notice
that I shall not honour it. I regret to be obliged to write to you in
this strain, but my paternal duty is paramount to my inclination;
and if I were to fail in the former, I should be unworthy of the title of

Immediately on the receipt of this communication, IBRAHIM PACHA
packed up his carpet-bag, and made arrangements for returning home
as speedily as possible.
DUCKS AND DRAKES ON THE RIVER-
It has long been notorious, that among the civic sports and pastimes
the game of swan-hopping is a very favourite one. It may not be so
generally known that with this is combined another species of aquatic
amusement, to which the Lord MAYok and Aldermen are extremely
partial. We allude to the diversion of “ducks and drakes.” For this
pleasant recreation, a convenient piece of water is necessary, and such
an accommodation is afforded by the river Thames. It is usually played
with pebbles, bits of slate, or oyster-shells; but instead of these the
civic monarch and his subordinates use money, than which nothing can
more readily serve to play ducks and drakes with.
It was stated, the other day, by MR. ANDERTON, in the Court of
Common Council, that £3000 are annually thrown away on this amuse-
ment, in the conservancy of the river. A grand match is shortly to
come off at Oxford, where it has been arranged to take place by the
Court of Aldermen; and as the expense of it is to be unlimited, it will
be fine fun, as well for those who are to enjoy, as for the people who will
profit by it. It is, however, declared by the Livery, that what may be
fun for the Mayor and Aldermen is death to them ; but this is the
language of the frogs in the fable, and is to be regarded as mere croaking.
The amusement of “ducks and drakes” is generally considered to be
a puerile one, but as practised with unlimited funds by the civic dig-
nitaries, it must, at all events, be admitted to be no child's play.

A REAL ECLOGUE.
Two genuine swains, in rustic frocks bedight,
WILLUM and TUMMUs by each other hight,
Beneath a hedge-row, at the hour of noon,
Sat, shelter'd from the scorching sun of June–
From haymaking to snatch a moment's rest,
Whilst thus their mutual notions they express'd :—
TUMMUs.
Phew! I be briled wi' this here heat well nigh;
Hast any beer, mun ?—I be precious dry.
WILLUM.
Beer Ah I wish I had. I’ve drink'd it up,
And han’t a farden for another cup.
- TUMMUs.
Nine shill'ns a week, wi' wife and kids to feed,
Dwooant lave a feller much for beer, indeed!
WILLUM.
How is't now, mun, as gurt folks cram and stuff,
Whilst there be they as doesn't git enough 2
TUMMUs.
Well, that's the thing as always puzzles me:
Why, measter's pigs be better fed than we. -
WILLUM.
WILLUM, I never passes by their sty,
But wishes one o' them there pigs was I.
TUMMUs.
He med feed us with what 'a flings away
In stuff'n up and over fatt'n they.
WILLUM.
But, WILLUM, look where yander measter rides;
He'll gie it to 's if here we longer 'bides.
CURIOSITIES OF ADVERTISING LITERATURE.
We find in the Times of July 14th an advertisement of “a Gardener,
with one child who thoroughly understands his business;” and another
announcement, also of “a Gar-
dener, who has no objection to
a cow.” We do not see the
advantage to be derived to an
employer by the precocity of
the infant of his servant ; but
we presume the gardener will
be able to point out, on further
inquiry, how the “one child
who understands his business”
may be made available. The
other gardener, who “ has no
objection to a cow,” seems to
be going rather unnecessarily
into minutiae, when he sets forth
the fact of his non-antipathy to -
that most harmless animal.
The man must be captious,
indeed, who would entertain
feelings of hostility to that
most unexceptionable of crea-
tures. “No objection to a cow,
indeed 1" We should think #
not ; the fellow might as well
advertise that he is not afraid
of butterflies.
By the bye, the advertising-nuisance inventors seem trying to out-
punch Punch. Their devices are as extravagant as their terms are
cheap, and it is clear that they mean to surpass us in preposterous
conceptions. A lot of fellows are now going about town in white
smocks, “branded,” as the Daily News says, “with advertisements.”
We should think that a few broad-backed coalheavers would find
regular employment by application to the cheap tailors, sloe-leaf mer-
chants, and quack doctors.
A GOOD ILLUSTRATION.
A NEw work has been advertised, called “Dangers by Land and
Water.” The frontispiece should be an illustration of Westminster
Bridge.

THE
TAGLIONI TREATY.

º-
E/A
TAGLIONI YIELDING TO THE ENTREATIES OF HER FRIENDS. -
OREGON and its Treaty were important; but TAGLIoni and her treaty
are, in the words of a celebrated anti-grammarian, “importanter still.”
On hearing that the déesse de la danse had been prevailed upon by her
friends to reappear for a few nights at Her Majesty's Theatre, the
subscribers to the Opera were in extasies. The public delight knew
no bounds, the Stall market was in a most active state, and even the
eight-and-sixpenny pit scrip was in eager demand at all the music-
sellers'. Much praise is due to the parties who brought America to
terms, but the bringing of TAGLIoni to terms is a still greater achieve-
ment. MR. LUMLEY is the diplomatist who has accomplished this
most difficult task. Settling a boundary line is nothing, compared to
the successfully bringing TAGLIONI within reasonable bounds—an effort
. none but the present manager of the Opera would have ven-
tured On.
In order to effect this tremendous object the intervention of the
friends of the fair danseuse has, we are told, been necessary. Those
friends have been despatched in large numbers by MR. LUMLEY, and
their arguments have had their influence. Such friends are worth
their weight in gold, and their portraits appear in the annexed illus-
tration. It required, however, the united efforts of a vast concourse
of these friends to prevail upon TAGLIONI to rescind her resolution of
retiring from the theatre of her many triumphs. At length, however,
they exercised their sovereign sway, and the Sylphide has exhibited a
proper deference to their golden opinions. It certainly betrays an
amiable weakness, thus to yield to the notes of friendship when all
other inducements have proved fruitless. No one ought to take a step
without consideration, and TAGLIONI never, we believe, thinks of taking
a step without some very serious consideration being bestowed upon it.
SYMPTOMS OF LEISURE.
AMong the symptoms of leisure afforded to SIR. R. PEEL by cessation
from the cares of Government is the curious and rather inconvenient
fact of his having cut his foot—fortunately not seriously—by resting
it on a china basin. It is evident that the Ex-Premier has been in-
dulging in what is usually called a rollick on his happy release from
the labours he has for some years incessantly undergone as Minister.
He has clearly been imitating BARON NATHAN in a true joyousness of
spirit, by capering among a set of breakfast things. How did he get
his foot into a china basin, unless he was attempting some feat of dex-
terity by poising himself gracefully on the edge of the delicate article
which belongs to his tea-service P. We are sincerely sorry for the little
accident, but we are pleased to find that SIR R. PEEL is able to indulge
these harmless freaks in the bosom of his domestic circle.
We should not wonder if the incident arose out of some little joke
upon the sugar question, when the Ex-Premier would naturally congra-
tulate himself on the fact that sugar, in a political point of view, need
cause him no further uneasiness. We can fancy his saying playfully,
“Thus do I trample it under my foot!” and skipping briskly on to the
edge, as we have seen the clown at FRANCoNI's walk along the tops of the
champagne bottles. When he next attempts a gambol of this kind, we
recommend him to try an earthenware pan, on the rim of which he
might perch without fear of its breaking under him.
ROUGE ET NOIR.
WE noticed a shower of black rain two numbers back. This has
been followed in the north by a shower of red. It seems that the
“inky clouds” can pour down any coloured ink they please. The next
shower, of course, will be blue. We are inclined to believe the Clerk
of the weather is the Emperor of all the Incas. (Oh /)
THE DANIEL LAMBERTS OF ANIMAL LIFE.
WE certainly did not envy the huge beasts last week at the New-
castle Agricultural Show. Imagine an unfortunate cow, twice the size
of Daniel Lambert, with three chins, buried in acres of fat, scarcely
able to breathe, bending under the accumulated weight of grease and
glory, locked up with fifty other apoplectic animals, on a day when the
heat was so intense that the legs of mutton were roasting in the
butchers' shops. The farmers walked about the show in their shirt-
sleeves, too glad to take off their coats, and we have no doubt the poor
animals wished they could do the same. . Our wonder is there was not
a river of liquid tallow, as broad as the Tyne, running through the
pavilion. The Southdowns alone seemed to escape the heat, but this
probably was owing to their superior breeding, which enables them to
rise above the ordinary we(a)ther. We noticed, with gushing drops of
perspiration a poor wheezing bull, munching a bit of cake, which we
thought was only adding insult to injury. We thought of the insatiable
hatred and withering scorn we should feel for the monster in human
form who, if we were dying of thirst on the burning sands of Arabia,
offered us a pound of gingerbread or a pot of anchovy paste.
The Snubbed One,
SIR. CULLING EARDLEY SMITH never alluded once at Edinburgh to
the British Lion. This neglect from one, who, on every former occa-
sion, clung to the Lion's mane, and pinched his tail to make him roar, met
with its due reward. SIR CULLING was thrown out. Yet we cannot
help thinking, if he had thrown himself boldly on the British Lion, he
would have been brought in. If SIR C. EARDLEY SMITH had only let
the British Lion loose, we are sure he would have carried everything
before him.

THE SNOBS OF ENGLAND.
BY ONE OF THEMSELVEs.
CHAP. XXL–ARE THERE ANY WHIG SNOBS?
oRTUNATELY this is going to be quite a little chap-
\ ter. I am not going, like THoMAs of Finsbury,
Nº to put ugly questions to Government, or obstruct
^* in anyway the march of the Great Liberal
Administration. The best thing we can do is
not to ask questions at all, but to trust the
Whigs implicitly, and rely on their superior
wisdom. They are wiser than we are. A
kind Providence ordained that they should
govern us, and endowed them with universal
knowledge. Other people change their opin-
ions : they never do. For instance, PEEL
avows that his opinions on the Corn Laws
have gone right round — the Whigs have
never changed ; they have always held the Free-Trade doctrines;
they have always been wise and perfect. We didn't know
it : but it's the fact—LoRD JoHN says so. And the great
Whig chiefs go down to their constituents, and congratulate them-
selves and the world that Commercial Freedom is the law of the
Empire, and bless Heaven for creating Whigs to expound this
great truth to the world. Free Trade! Heaven bless you ! the Whigs
invented Free Trade—and everything else that ever has been invented.
Some day or other—when the Irish Church goes by the board ; when,
perhaps, the State Church follows it; when Household Suffrage
becomes an acknowledged truth ; when Education actually does
become National ; when even the Five Points of THOMAs of Finsbury
come to be visible to the naked eye—you will see the Whigs always
were advocates for Household Suffrage; that they invented National
Education; that they were the boys who settled the Church Question ;
and that they had themselves originated the Five Points, of which
FEARGUs O'Connor was trying to take the credit. Where there's
Perfection there can't be Snobbishness. The Whigs have known and
done—know and do—will know and do everything.
And again, you can't expect reasonably to find many Snobs among
them. There are so few of them. A fellow who writes a book about
the Aristocracy of England, and calls himself HAMPPEN, Junior, (and
who is as much like John HAMPDEN as Mr. Punch is like the APOLLO
BELVIDERE), enumerates a whole host of trades, and names of English-
men who have been successful in them ; and finds that the aristocracy
has produced—no good tin-men, let us say, or lawyers, or tailors, or
artists, or divines, or dancers on the tight-rope, or persons of other
callings; whereas, out of THE PEOPLE have sprung numbers more or
less who have distinguished themselves in the above professions. The
inference of which is, that the aristocracy is the inferior, the people
the superior race. This is rather hard of HAMPDEN, Junior, and not
quite a fair argument against the infamous and idiotic aristocracy;
for it is manifest that a Lord cannot play upon the fiddle, or paint
pictures by a natural gift and without practice; that men adopt pro-
fessions in order to live, and if they have large and comfortable means
of livelihood are, not uncommonly, idle. The sham HAMPDEN, I say,
does not consider that their lordships have no call to take upon them-
selves the exercise of the above-named professions; and above all,
omits to mention that the people are as forty thousand to one to the
nobility; and hence, that the latter could hardly be expected to pro-
duce so many distinguished characters as are to be found in the ranks
of the former.
In like manner (I am willing to confess the above illustration is
confoundedly long, but in a work on Snobs, A RADICAL SNoB may have
a passing word as well as another), I say, there can't be many Snobs
among Whigs ; there are so very few Whigs among men.
I take it, there are not above one hundred real downright live
Whigs in the world—some five-and-twenty, we will say, holding
office; the remainder ready to take it. You can't expect to find
many of the sort for which we are seeking in such a small company.
How rare it is to meet a real acknowledged Whig I Do you know
one * Do you know what it is to be a Whig I can understand a
man being anxious for this measure or that, wishing to do away with
the sugar duties, or the corn duties, or the Jewish disabilities, or what
you will ; but in that case, if PEEL will do my business and get rid of
the nuisance for me, he answers my purpose just as well as anybody
else with any other name. I want my house set in order, my room
made clean ; I do not make particular inquiries about the broom and
the dust-pan.
To be a Whig you must be a reformer—as much or little of this as
you like—and something more. You must believe not only that the
Corn-Laws must be repealed, but that the Whigs must be in office ;
not only that Ireland must be tranquil, but that the Whigs must be in
| Downing Street : if the people will have reforms, why of course you
can't help it; but remember, the Whigs are to have the credit. I
believe that the world is the Whigs, and that everything they give us
is a blessing. When LoRD JoHN the other day blessed the people at
Guildhall, and told us all how the Whigs had got the Corn-Bill for us,
I declare I think we both believed it. It wasn't Cobrew and VILLIERs
and the people that got it—it was the Whigs, somehow, that octroyéd
the measure to us.
They are our superiors, and that’s the fact. There is what Thomas
of Finsbury almost blasphemously called “A Whig Dodge,”—and
beats all other dodges. I'm not a Whig myself, (perhaps it is as
unnecessary to say so, as to say I am not KING PIPPIN in a golden
coach, or KING Hudson, or Miss BURDETT CouTTs,) I’m not a Whig ;
but, Oh, how I should like to be one :
33rtractbinarp (tomfeggion.
WE now and then hear instances of people going and giving them-
selves in charge for some great crime or other which they have never
committed ; but this kind of self-accusation is frequently the result of
dining out, and the conscience gets cleared by a bottle of soda water
and an appearance before a magistrate. It is seldom, however, that
we find a person issuing printed placards in which he announces him-
self to have been guilty of some offence, of which he is completely
innocent. An auctioneer's posting bill from Gravesend, however, com-
mences in the following startling manner:—
“SALE BY AUCTION.
No. 4, Edwin STREET, GRAvesEND, the very House where the
zºº.º. I ºn B.A. G. S.
winnis s1.clare Tren when
THE GRAVESEND POST-OFFICE
was nonprºp, by
MR. EVERSFIELD,
On MoRDAY, JULY 13th, 1846. &c. &c.”
Fortunately for this gentleman, it is a notorious fact that he did not
rob the Gravesend Post-office on the day he alleges himself to have
done so, for the establishment was not robbed at all on that day, nor
has there been any robbery except one, for which the real delinquent
has already been tried and sentenced to transportation. It is, we pre-
sume, with the view of attracting public attention to the sale that the
auctioneer has announced himself to be the robber of the Gravesend
Post-office, a charge for which there is no foundation whatever. We
think this is going a little too far in zeal for his employers, and we
recommend MR. EveRSFIELD not to venture too far in this style of puff-
ing, which, if it should happen to be taken literally by those un-
acquainted with the respectability of his character, might do him
serious injury.

40 PUNCH, OR THE
LONDON CHARIVARL
WORK FOR WARNER.
As the great stumbling-stock to the trial of CAPTAIN WARNER's Long
Range is the expense connected with the destruction of a man-of-war,
we beg leave to propose certain subjects, the demolition of which would
be hailed as an immense boon to the community. There is that fine
old specimen of craziness, Westminster Bridge; we are sure old
Father Thames would be unspeakably grateful for having such a load
taken off his bosom, and no one would be dissatisfied excepting a few
watermen who officiate, as cockney Charons, in ferrying over the timid
souls who prefer, in crossing the river, the safety of a wager-boat to the
danger of a bridge. There is also Battersea Bridge, and its worthy
brother Putney, both of whom, if tried by their piers, would have been
condemned long ago. It is time that their knells were tolled. Let CAP-
TAIN WARNER have a “shy” at these nuisances, and if he succeed in
knocking down any one of them, his “Long Range” should be imme-
diately bought up by the Commissioners for the Improvement of the
Metropolis. Such a besom has long been wanted to sweep the metro-
polis clean of its many unsightly obstructions. When it had nothing
better to do, it might have a gentle brush at Temple Bar.
“MR. PUNCH, QIjt 330ttrp of $team.
“SIR,--Being a stoker, it is natural I should feel enthusiastic
on the subject of steam. It appears to me, Sir, that MR. WoRDsworth
makes a great mistake when he talks of steamers and railways as-
‘Motions and means on land and sea, at war
With old poetic feeling.”
For my own part, I think there's a deal more poetry in steam-engines
than in anything else, except men and women. I have tried my hand
at a description of the Seven Ages of Steam, after SHARspEARE, and
venture to send it to you to show the world and my brother stokers
that there is some poetry about us.
“Yours respectfully, John Coke.”
“The world's ruled by steam,
And all the men and women are its subjects :
It guides their movements and their whereabouts;
And this steam, in its time, plays many parts,
Its acts being Seven Ages. At first, the kettle,
Hissing and sputtering on a kitchen hob,
And then NEwcomeN's engine, to its piston,
By atmospheric pressure, giving force
Imperfectly to pump : Then WATT's condenser,
More economic, with its stuffing-box
And double-acting movement : Then a steam-boat,
Full of strange smells, and cramm'd like NoAH's ark,
(It, on high pressure, sudden and quick to explode,)
Raising up FULtoN's reputation
In everybody's mouth : Then the steam-horse,
By STEPHENsoN devised, on Wall's-End fed,
With boiler grimed and—wheels of clumsy cut,
Spurning brass knobs and copper ornaments—
And so he plays his part: The Sixth Age shifts
Into the war of broad and narrow gauge;
BRUNEL on one, HUDson on t'other side—
Their several lines stretching a world too wide
For the Committee's and Steam's manly voice
That, in the kettle's childish treble piped,
Now whistles o'er the world: Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is general brotherhood, and mere oblivion
Of troops, of wars, of blood, and all such things.”
THE LEGAL MAELSTROM.
THIs dangerous eddy is situated in the vicinity of Lincoln's Inn
Fields. There is, perhaps, no vortex in the world so certainly
destructive to everything that may come near it; nor is there any
shoal or quicksand that can rival it in fatal celebrity. Scylla and
Charybdis are mere mill-pools compared to it; the Goodwin Sands
may have swallowed up one estate, but this has gulped down thousands.
The moment any description of property gets within its reach, it may
be regarded as irrecoverably lost. The owner, if he is wise, will
instantly give himself up for bankrupt, and prepare to meet his doom.
When first entangled, he is heard to utter cries of distress, which
gradually increase as he gets nearer and nearer to the gulf about to
swallow him. At length, on the brink of this horrible end, maddened
by despair, the frantic wretch often commits suicide.
Will it be believed, it is in the power of the Legislature to do away
with this frightful whirlpool, and yet the thing is not done? The obstacle
to its accomplishment lies with certain legal fishermen, the principal of
whom are termed Law Lords, who derive a booty from the wrecks oc-
casioned by the abyss. This Maelström is commonly called the Court
of Chancery, and its abolition now rests with LoBD JoHN RUSSELL.

REFLECTIONS ON THE DUKE'S STATUE.
E have heard a great
deal of the new eques-
trian statue at Hyde
Park, and if all the
accounts of the interior
be correct, it will cer-
tainly beat all the
other statues hollow.
It seems that small
dinner parties have
been given inside the
horse. If this is true,
it may be the inten-
tion of the Duke to
hold the Waterloo
Banquets, for the fu-
ture, inside his own
Statue.
We think, however,
if these entertain-
ments for man and
beast are repeated, it
may be as well to give
the public notice, or else the patriotic passer-by, sniffing up the smoke
as it issues in savoury curls from the nostrils of the horse, may go
home (as most Englishmen are led by the nose) with the notion that
the statue is fed upon venison and turtle ; such a conclusion, at a
time when there is an increase of £7,000,000 in the expenditure of the
country, might lead to dangerous results.
But we think the great room there is inside for improvement might
be turned to considerable advantage. Why not let out the statue in
lodgings 2 We are positive the following advertisement would bring a
thousand applications:–
Tº BE LET. A Comfortable Room in the Hind-Leg of the Equestrian
Statue of the Duke. A suite of rooms may also be had, extending from the right
shoulder to the left hip. The situation is exceedingly airy, the prospect delightful,
commanding a splendid view of Hyde Park and Lord FRANCIs EGERTON's bed-room,
and the ventilation perfect, as the eyes and ears of the horse are kept wide open all
day. The lodging can be reached at all hours of the day by means of a ladder. The
Duke's head still vacant.
There should be a proviso in the letting, that no Frenchman was to
be a tenant—or else some vindictive Bonapartist might get on the weak
side of the Duke, and do him bodily injury.
We would not mind living in the Duke's heart ourselves, if we
thought there was any room for us, but we know too well that every
corner of it is occupied by his country. We only wish the lease was
for 99.9 years.
PUNCH*S FABLES AND APOLOGUES.
FOR THE USE OF YOUNG POLITICLANS.
THE FISHERMAN AND THE GENI.
(Dedicated to Sir Robert Peel and Richard Cobden.)
THERE was once an old Fish-er-man call-ed Rob-ERT. He went out
to fish, and cast his net in-to the sea. And when he drew up his net,
he found it ve-ry hea-vy. “Al-lah pre-serve us,” said Rob-ERT, “what
can be in my net that it is so hea-vy 2 " So he pull-ed and pull-ed, and
at last got his net upon the shore, and found in it a dead Don-key.
And the Don-key's name was burnt on the Donkey's side, and the name
was “PRO-TEC-TION.” Then Rob-ERT turn-ed the dead Don-key
0-ver ma-ny times, to see what he could do with it. At last, “Out
upon it,” said he, “and up-on my ill-luck What good can be done
with a dead don-key 7 I will try an-o-ther cast.” So he threw the dead
don-key back into the sea, and let down his net a-gain. And as he
pull-ed it up he found it ve-ry hea-vy, and he thought he had got some
large fish. And when he drew the net on land he found in it an old pot,
on which was punch-ed “Fixed Duty,” but the pot was full of holes,
and would not hold wa-ter.
Then he curs-ed his ill-luck once more, and said, “I will make one
more tri-al, and if I get no fish I will not try a-gain to-day.” So he
threw the old pot in-to the sea, and let down his net again. And, as he
pull-ed it up, he found it much more hea-vy than e-ver, and he said, “I
flat-termy-self this is a large fish.” And when he drew the net on land,
he found in it a ves-sel of bronze with a seal on the mouth, on which
was writ-ten “Re-stric-tion,” and on the ves-sel was the word “League.”
And he heard a voice from the in-side of the ves-sel, which said, “Take
off the seal.” And he took it off a ve-ry lit-tle way, and there came a
thick smoke out of the bot-tle, and it grew and grew, till it rose up to
the skies, and it was like a great gi-ant. And its eyes were like flame,
and its limbs like the cranks and pis-tons of steam en-gines, and on its
right hand was writ-ten “Peace,” and on its left hand “Know-ledge.”
And Rob-ERT fell on his knees, and said, “O migh-ty Gi-ant l who art
thou, and what wouldst thou have 2 ”
Then the Gi-ant said, “I am a great pow-er, and I have been for a
great ma-ny years, con-fined by that seal, which thou hast re-moved,
and for this thou shalt be great and hap-py.” So when Roß-ERT heard
this, he was very glad ; but he could not un-der-stand how so huge a
Gi-ant could come out of so lit-tle a ves-sel. So he said to the Gi-ant,
“I can-not be-lieve that so large a bo-dy could come out of so small a
place.” Then the Gi-ant said, “Will you be-lieve it, if I go back a-gain,
for while the seal is off, I do not care for go-ing back in-to the ves-sel ?”
And then the Gi-ant grew less and less, and went by de-grees into the
ves-sel un-til he was quite out of sight. And then he said to Rob-ERT,
“Throw the seal in-to the sea, take the ves-sel, and keep it by
thee al-ways, and thou wilt be good and hap-py, and all men will
love thee.” And Rob-ERT threw the seal into the sea, took the
ves-sel, and did as the Gi-ant bade him, and he lived long and hap-py,
and brought great good and much mo-ney to all his fa-mi-ly and all
the coun-try round a-bout.
ANOTHER BLOW AT THE DRAMA.
IN the Times’ Supplement of the 13th, was the subjoined audacious
advertisement:—
O PERSONS KNOWING FRENCH.-A theatrical country manager
offers a SITUATION to any person capable of translating those French pieces
that appear at the London theatres for his own establishment; and further, to join
with that duty the office of Prompter. Terms £2 per week all the year round.
No member of the Dramatic Authors' Society will be treated with. Apply by letter,
post-paid, to X. Y. Z., at Mr. F 's, theatrical printer, M t, B-
This, it is plain, is a mortal blow aimed at the best interests of the
drama. Consider it, enthusiastic patron of the stage; if, as certain
tailors “keep a poet,” every country Manager employs his own trans-
lator, doubling him with prompter, messenger, or private knife-
cleaner—what is to become of a large, a useful, and most industrious
body of men, at the present time occupied upon their own account as
go-betweens to the French and London play-houses 2 We consider
the above advertisement to be malignant and mischievous, and call
. every translator (if the call be not unnecessary) to be “up and
oing.”
Prizes at the Agricultural Show.
PRIZEs were given to SIR Robert PEEL, for a new corn-crushing
machine, in the shape of a bill; to MR. THOMAS DUNcombe, for a new
style of chaffing ; to MR. DANIEL O'Connell, for the best set of
tools, for draining a poor soil; to PRINCE ALBERT, for an improved
tile for drills; to LoRD BRough AM and LoRD LYNDHURST, for a short
process of cutting wool ; to MR. HUME, for a machine for paring in
all seasons ; and to SIRCULLING EARDLEY SMITH, for the best machine
for bolting.
HOW TO TELL THE AGE OF A LADY.
HE age of a lady could be ascer-
tained a short time ago by the
number of flounces she wore on
her dress. Thus, if not more than
twenty, she had only two flounces;
if above thirty, she had three
flounces; if she had passed the
woman's rubicon—forty, then she
displayed four deep flounces; and
soon, adding an additional flounce
for every ten years. Since this
scale of measurement, however,
has become generally known, the
preposterous fashion of having
the dress all flounces, running
from the pavement up to the
waist, has been gradually going out. It is a rare thing now to meet a
lady whose dress displays more than one flounce. We even saw a
lady at Kensington Gardens, the last band day, whose mousseline had
no flounce at all, which we thought was carrying the female propensity
of concealing age to too great an absurdity; but on peeping under
her bonnet we saw at once the difficulty she must have laboured under,
for she certainly looked as if—like SHARSPEARE—she was of no time,
but belonged to all ages.

CoNSIDERABLE inconvenience is every now and then occasioned by the erection of a boarding
in Fleet Street, in front of some house where nothing appears to be going on in the way of
repairs; and our curiosity has naturally been excited to know what on earth has been going
on within the inclosure. By the aid of the barrier and our own energy we succeeded in
scrambling up the sides of the railing a day or two ago, and witnessed a most extraordinary
scene ; which, had not our artist come to our aid, we should have been utterly unable to give
a description of The inclosure, cut off from the thoroughfare, to the obstruction of the
carriage-way and the utter absorption of the foot-path, was being devoted to a quiet game at
skittles, in which the shopman was engaged, while the good-humoured proprietor was looking
on at the innocent pastime.
We should like to know by what law or authority these inclosures are made, and what
amount of repair to a house or shop justifies the taking a large slice out of the street by way
of pleasure-ground. Nothing is easier than to determine on putting in a new square of glass,
or doing some trifling piece of work to the front of a house, and instantly to make the repair
the pretext for running up a hoarding to secure a vacant space for the recreation of the
inmates. We are as anxious as any one for the healthy recreation of the people, but we think
those who live in such thoroughfares as Fleet Street ought to take the trouble of going to
Kennington Common, or some other popular place of out-of-door exercise before they think of
turning the city pavements into “good dry skittle grounds.”
A SCENE IN THE LORDS.
LoRD BROUGHAM rose with considerable emotion to complain of a most unconstitutional,
a most irregular, a most improper, and a most outrageous proceeding, with reference to the
salaries of the Judges. . He, LoRD BRough AM, had found with terror, with confusion, with
indignation and alarm, that those functionaries received reduced salaries by private arrange-
ment with the Treasury. It was monstrous—it was fearful—it was dreadful—it was indecent—
it was intolerable—it was unbearable; in a word, it was shameful, and he made use of every
one of those epithets advisedly; nor would he, when he left that house and retired to his
couch, retract one of those epithets: it was all he had described, and more than he could
describe, without violating the rules of the House, that this arrangement should have been
entered into.
EARL GREY admitted the fact to be as LoRD BRough AM had stated it; but it so happened
that the thing having been done when LoRD BRough AM himself was Chancellor, it came
under LoRD BRough AM's department, and indeed Lord Brough AM himself was chiefly
responsible for the irregularity he now complained of.
LoRD BRough AM begged to say that he had never heard a word about it.
: GREY must contradict the noble lord, and repeat, that he was cognizant of the whole
proceeding.
LoRD BRough AM. Never heard a word about it.
FARE GREY was sorry to differ, but he happened to know that the noble and learned
lord who now complained was a principal party to the arrangement.
Lond Bhough AM. Pooh, pooh f It's all new to me. Inever heard a word.
EARL GREY felt himself bound to adhere to
his statement, that the noble and learned lord
was cognizant of the proceeding.
LoRD BRough AM thought it very irregular
that he should be thus contradicted. He, Lord
BRough AM, had said one thing, and what right
had any noble lord to say the other?
EARL GREY would not have been obliged to
say the other, if the one thing said by LoBI)
BRough AM had been correct.
LoRD BROUGHAM. Nonsense, stuff, rubbish—
never heard a word about it—humbug—tom-
foolery—trash—
The rest of the noble lord's remarks were
inaudible in the gallery; and after a short
soliloquy from Lord BRough AM, which pro-
ceeded while the other business of the House
was going on, the subject dropped.
THE HYDE PARK CORNER CLOCK.
To the nocturnal pilgrim passing out of the
Great Metropolis, the Clock over the Curds and
Whey House used to be a sort of shrine—a
species of minor Mecca, produced by mechanism.
It was consoling to see the hour, and companion-
able to see the face of a friend, especially when
that friend was continually extending both his
hands in amiable amity. Lately, however, for
some reason or other, which is of course no rea-
son at all, the Clock has not
“Smiled as it was wont to smile,”
for it has been impossible to see its face, or recog-
nise its figure. The Clock, which, under the
influence of enlightenment, may be said to have
“Lisp'd in numbers, for the numbers came,”
has latterly been exceedingly dingy after dark,
and it is impossible to ascertain its meaning.
For the sake, therefore, of the travellers to the
“far west,” we earnestly call upon the Gasman to
light that Clock, in the same spirit as the Wood-
man was requested to spare that Tree :-
Gasman, light that Clock,
The time I cannot see ;
It can't be more than twelve,
And yet it looks like three:
Its hands are all confused,
Its numbers none can trace :
Say, is that humble Clock
Ashamed to show its face?
It can't be very late:
True—I’ve been out to sup;
But, ho lº what says the Clock 2
Come, Gasman, light it up.
Say, can the mist be caused
By fumes of generous wine 2
Is it three quarters past eleven,
Or is it only nine 2
Is it half-after twelve,
Or six, or eight, or two 2 -
That dismal rushlight kept inside
No good on earth can do.
When I go home to bed
I’m quite afraid to knock
If I’ve no notion of the hour—
So, Gasman, light that Clock.

a great body of Civilian Snobs in the country, towards the most It is out of common life altogether. Drilling—red coats, all of the
beloved of our Institutions; that Institution, the health of which same pattern, with the same number of buttons—flogging—marching
is always drunk after the Church at public dinners—the British with the same leg foremost—are not natural ... put a bayonet into a
Army. I myself, when I wrote a slight dissertation upon Military
Snobs,-called upon to do so by a strict line of duty,+treated them
with a tenderness and elegant politeness which I am given to under-
stand was admired and appreciated in the warlike clubs, in messes,
and other soldatesque societies : but to suppose that criticism should
go so far as it has done during the last ten days; that every unedu-
cated Cockney should presume to have a judgment; that civilians at
taverns and clubs should cry shame; that patriots in the grocery or
linen-drapery-line should venture to object ; that even ignorant women
and mothers of families, instead of superintending the tea and butter
at breakfast, should read the newspapers, forsooth, and utter their shrill
cries of horror at the account of the Floggings at Hounslow—to sup-
pose, I say, that society should make such a hubbub as it has done for
the last fortnight, and that perhaps at every table in England there
should be a cry of indignation—this is too much—the audacity of
Civilian Snobs is too great, and must be put an end to at once. I take
part against the PEKINs, and am authorised to say, after a conversa-
tion with Mr. Punch, that that gentleman shares in my opinion that
the Army must be protected.
The answer which is always to be made to the Civilian Snob when
he raises objections against military punishments, promotions, pur-
chases, or what not, is invariable.—He knows nothing about it.—How
the deuce can you speculate about the army, PEKIN, who don't know
the difference between a firelock and a fusee ?
This point I have seen urged, with great effect, in the military
papers, and most cordially agree that it is an admirable and unanswer-
able argument. A particular genius, a profound study, an education
specially military, are requisite, before a man can judge upon so com-
plicated a matter as the army; and these, it is manifest, few civilians
can have enjoyed. But any man who has had the supreme satisfac-
tion of making the acquaintance of Ensign and Lieutenant GRIGG, of
the Guards, CAPTAIN FAMISH, of the Hottentot Buffs, or hundreds of
young gentlemen of their calling, must acknowledge that the army is
safe under the supervision of men like these. Their education is
brilliant, their time is passed in laborious military studies ; the conver-
sation of mess-rooms is generally known to be philosophical, and the
pursuits of officers to be severely scientific. So ardent in the acquisi-
tion of knowledge in youth, what must be their wisdom in old age 7
By the time GRIgG is a Colonel (and, to be sure, knowledge grows
much more rapidly in the Guard regiments, and a young veteran may
be a Colonel at five-and-twenty,) and FAMIsh has reached the same
rank—these are the men who are more fitted than ever for the conduct
of the army; and how can any civilian know as much about it as they 7
These are the men whose opinions the civilians dare to impugni and
I can conceive nothing more dangerous, insolent—Snobbish, in a word
—than such an opposition.
When men such as these, and the very highest authorities in the
army, are of opinion that flogging is requisite for the British soldier,
it is manifestly absurd of the civilian to interfere. Do you know as
much about the army and the wants of the soldier, as FIELD-MARshAL
the DUKE of WELLINGToN ? If the Great Captain of the Age con-
siders flogging is one of the wants of the army, what business have
you to object 2 You're not flogged. You are a PEKIN. To lash
fellow-creatures like hounds, may be contrary to your ideas of decency,
morals, and justice; to submit Christian men to punishments brutal,
savage, degrading, ineffectual, may be revolting to you ; but to
suppose that such an eminent philanthropist as the great Captain of
the Age would allow such penalties to be inflicted on the troops if they
could be done away with, is absurd. A word from the Chiefs of the
army, and the Cat might have taken its place as an historical weapon
in the Tower, along with the boots and the thumb-screws of the
Spanish Armada. But, say you, very likely the Great Captain of his
Age, the DUKE of ALvA, might have considered thumb-screws and
boots just as necessary for discipline as the Cat is supposed to be now.
PEKIN Don't meddle with subjects quite beyond the sphere of your
knowledge. Respect the Articles of War, and remember that the
man's hand, he would not naturally thrust it into the belly of a
Frenchman : very few men, of their own natural choice, would wear,
by way of hat, such a cap as ColoneL WHYTE and his regiment wear
every day—a muff, with a red worsted bag dangling down behind it,
and a shaving-brush stuck by way of ornament in front : the whole
system is something egregious—artificial. The civilian, who lives
out of it, can't understand it. It is not like the other professions,
which require intelligence. A man one degree removed from idiocy,
with brains just sufficient to direct his powers of mischief or
endurance, may make a distinguished soldier. A boy may be set over
a veteran : we see it every day. A lad with a few thousand pounds
may purchase a right to command which the most skilful and
scientific soldier may never gain. Look at the way Ensign GRIGG,
just come from school, touches his cap to the enormous old private
who salutes him—the gladiator of five-and-twenty campaigns.
And if the condition of the officer is wonderful and anomalous,
think of that of the men . There is as much social difference between
ENSIGN GRIgG and the big gladiator, as there is between a gang of
convicts working in the hulks and the keepers in charge of them.
Hundreds of thousands of men eat, march, sleep, and are driven hither
and thither in gangs all over the world—GRIgG and his clan riding by
and superintending ; they get the word of command to advance or fall
back, and they do it: they are told to strip, and they do it ; or to
flog, and they do it : to murder or be murdered, and they obey—for
their food and clothing, and twopence a day for beer and tobacco.
For nothing more :—no hope—no ambition—no chance for old days,
but Chelsea Hospital. How many of these men in time of war, when
their labour is most needed and best paid, escape out of their slavery !
Between the soldier and the officer there is such a gulf fixed, that to
cross it is next to a miracle. There was one Mameluke escaped when
MEHEMET ALI ordered the destruction of the whole troop of them ; so
certainly astray officeror two may have come from the ranks, but he is a
wonder. No: such an Institution as this is a mystery, which all civilians,
I suppose, had best look at in silent wonder, and of which we must leave
the management to its professional chiefs. Their care for their sub-
ordinates is no doubt amiable, and the gratitude of these to their
superiors must be proportionably great. When the tipsy young Lieu-
tenant of the 4th Dragoons cut at his Adjutant with a sabre, he was
reprimanded and returned back to his duty, and does it, no doubt,
very well ; when the tipsy private struck his corporal, he was
flogged, and died after the flogging. There must be a line drawn,
look you, otherwise the poor private might have been forgiven too, by
the Great Captain of the Age, who pardoned the gentleman-offender.
There must be distinctions and differences, and mysteries which are
beyond the comprehension of the civilian, and this paper is written as
a warning to all such not to meddle with affairs that are quite out of
their sphere.
But then there is a word, Mr. Punch declares, to be said to other
great Commanders and Field-Marshals besides the historic Conqueror
of Assaye, Vittoria, and Waterloo. We have among us, thank Heaven
a Field-Marshal whose baton has been waved over fields of triumph
the least sanguinary that ever the world has known. We have an
august FAMILY FIELD-MARSHAL, so to speak, and to him we desire
humbly to speak :—
“Your Royal Highness,” we say,+* your Royal Highness, (who has
the ear of the Head of the army,) pour into that gracious ear the
supplications of a nation. Say that as a nation we entreat and im-
plore that no English Christian man should any longer suffer the in-
fernal torture of the Cat. Say, that we had rather lose a battle than
flog a soldier; and that the courage of the Englishman will not suffer
by the loss. And if your Royal HIGHNEss PRINCE ALBERT will deign
to listen to this petition, we venture to say, that you will be the most
beloved of Field-Marshals, and that you will have rendered a greater
service to the British people, and the British army, than ever was
rendered by any Field-Marshal since the days of MALBRook.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A CASE FOR FEMALE SYMPATHY.
sº
tion in favour of the QUEEN OF SPAIN.
She has about twenty lovers, and is
not allowed to marry one. France
ofiars a husband whom she must not
have for fear of displeasing NARVAEz.
NARVAEz introduces a young prince
whom England does not like. England
sends a member of that fine matri-
monial country, Coburg, where princes
are taught at school to sit upon
thrones, and wield sceptres; but Louis-
PHILIPPE says “No : the Queen can't
have a Bourbon, and she shan’t have
a Coburg.” Portugal even recommends
its candidate, whilst CARLos, MIGUEL,
and QUEEN CHRISTINA have each a
miserable protégé, who are continually
proposing to IsabelLA, and being
married regularly once a week—in
the newspapers. But amidst all this
confusion of opposition husbands, the
poor Queen is likely to die an old
maid. She is not allowed to marry
any one she likes, and every state is
wishing her to marry some one she
does not like. We propose, therefore,
in order to end these differences, that
there should be a royal election. Let
all the princes go to the poll, and he
who gets the greatest number of votes be returned husband of the
QUEEN of SPAIN. We think, in a matter of this delicate nature,
the Ladies only should vote. What an animated scene it would be l
We can imagine all the placards ! “Keine Bourbon.” “A bas le
Cobourg.” “Vote for PRINCE WIDDIcomb, and a Real Moustache.”
“DoN HENRIQUE and Spanish Liquorice.” “Le Duc DE MonTPEN-
SIER, et beaucoup de Champagne.” “Le PRINCE DEs Asturies.
Tousses châteaux sont en Espagne.”
The state of the Poll would be returned as follows:–
THE rscunia L., 5 o'clock.
Prince Widdicomb of Widdicomb . - . 20,000,000
Le Duc de Montpensier - - - 268,324
Prinz Hermuth von Suckerwasser 33,825
Le Prince des Asturies - - - 110
Don Henrique . - 6
Great Triumph of the Real Moustache// Long live King Widdicomb///
Seriously, we hope some scheme will yet be devised to put an end to
these petty squabbles about choosing a husband. One would really
think that the QUEEN had no voice in the matter. Considering she is
the party the most interested, she ought to be allowed to do as she
likes! Ladies, rally round the QUEEN of SPAIN, and assert your rights'
THINGS WHICH REQUIRE TO BE “PUT DOWN.”
A NUMBER of Ladies have written a round-robin to SIR PETER
LAURIE, begging of him, since he has a reputation for “putting down”
everything, to have the kindness to save their bonnets and their com-
plexion by “putting down” the dust.
The brewers, omnibus-men, and private coachmen have written a
memorial to the same indefatigable magistrate, praying that at his
earliest leisure he will “put down” the pavement in Holborn, which
they complain has been up ever since the recollection of the oldest
hackney-coachman.
The Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge have written to
SIR PETER LAURIE, saying they only want £1,500,000 to complete their
Biographical Dictionary. If SIR PETER will “put down” this sum,
the Society will be very much obliged to him.
Lastly, if SIR PETER LAURIE will try his hand upon the Trafalgar
Fountains, Westminster Bridge, the wind at the corner of St. Paul's
Churchyard, the advertising carts, and other nuisances, and put them
all down, we will willingly confess, on the part of ourselves and the
nation, that he is really the greatest Putter Down the world ever knew.
MUSICAL INTELLIGENCE.
THE report is at the music-sellers’ that RossINI is about to write a
new opera. We understand it is a companion to the “Mosè in Egyptto,”
to be called “Mosè in Minori,” or Moses in the Minories.
EALLY the Ladies should get up an agita-
BE CONSISTENT.
THE Protectionist gentlemen, who have suddenly become sofastidious
that they will not take a cup of tea because it is sweetened with
slave-grown, sugar, should really carry out their fastidiousness with
regard to other things. There should be a consistency in their aver-
sions. The diamond mines are mostly worked by slaves. How would
the wealthy Lords of Exeter Hall like throwing up their stars and
coronets because the pearls and precious stones in them are worked
by slaves * . We wonder, also, they do not throw up all their silver
and gold, since they are indebted to the labour of slaves for every
sovereign and every sixpence they have. We propose the following
amendment to Lord GeoRGE BENTINck, the next time the Currency
Bill is discussed :— -
That'as the use of gold and silver only encourages the labour of
slayes, that the circulation of the country be for the future restricted
to bank notes and penny-pieces only, which are the produce of English
copper, and the result of British labour.

FANCY GOES A GREAT WAY.
“OH ! HF's AN ANsumi Dog, BUT HE AIN'T ARF so "ANsum as his Brothrit

PUNCH*S POLITICAL DICTIONARY.
LotterLEs. These have been abolished by Act of Parliament, and
marriage is now the only lottery that the law allows. Lotteries still
prevail at Ramsgate and some other watering-places, by means of an
instrument called a Wheel of Fortune ; but these do not come under
the head of games of chance, being, in fact, games of certainty, in
which the public must be losers. Life is sometimes called a lottery :
and there are some persons whose existence is a mere blank, while
others aim at the great prizes by trying to secure number one, though
it often turns out to be the wrong number at last, and nothing is gained
in the end by too much selfishness.
MACHINERY. This word has been defined by lexicographers to
mean any complicated work in which one part contributes to the
motion of another. This will not apply to the machinery of an Act of
Parliament, in which the complicated parts, instead of contributing
to the motion of the others, often make the whole thing impracticable.
Man is sometimes called a machine, and a coach-horse is frequently
described as a valuable machiner; from which it must be inferred
that the brute is considered well adapted to draw a bathing-machine
at a watering-place.
MAGISTRATE–from the word Magister, a master. The term Justice
used formerly to be applied, but Justice having become obsolete among
many functionaries of this class, they have got the name of Magis-
trates. The distinction appears to be, that while JUSTICE is said to
be blind, preventing her from seeing any difference of persons, a Magis-
trate has both eyes open, or is, vulgarly speaking, wide awake to all
the varieties of rank and station.
A CONSCIENTIOUS CANARY.
*-THERE is a Canary in the possession of an old woman at Good-
wood which will not touch a bit of Sugar that is not grown in the
British colonies. Nothing will induce it to taste the most refined
Muscovado that is the produce of slave-labour. This wonderful little
Canary is to be exhibited shortly at Exeter Hall.

learnt that a scarf has been presented to BARON NATHAN, by the in-
habitants of Rosherville. As the inhabitants consist of the landlord
of the gardens and his family, the contributors to the testimonial are
not numerous ; but the scarf, a rich remnant of blue satin, a yard and
a-half long by fourteen inches wide, is worthy of the illustrious
recipient. .
The presentation took place on a gala-night, when a fair maiden,
clad in India's delicate muslin, and wearing shoes of the finest satin
of Denmark, tripped forth with lightsome step, and, as the Baron fell
upon one knee, threw the dazzling sky-blue “remnant” over his neck
and on his shoulders. NATHAN, overcome with emotion, felt the tear of
sentiment trickle down his manly nose ; and, in a voice suffocated
with his pocket-handkerchief, he uttered a few incoherent sentences.
He was understood to express a hope, that when he looked upon that
blue scarf, he might think of the blue eyes of the fair creature who
had done him the honour of putting it round his neck; and he hoped
it would prove a tie–not an opera tie (laughter and cheers)—between
himself and those around him. After adding that this was the
happiest moment—but six—of his existence, he announced that the
night of his benefit had been fixed, and that in lieu of the celebrated
pas des acufs, or egg polka, he had danced on previous occasions, he
should come out in a grand bolero among a recently-hatched brood,
being his first appearance as the donkey among the chickens. The
announcement was received with thunders of applause, and some
printed verses were handed about the room ; but as we forget their
purport, we present the following as a substitute :-
Illustrious NATHAN thou whose rapid leg
Whirls innocent above the fragile egg ;
Who seems supported on an eagle's wings,
Whilst hovering o'er a set of breakfast things—
Accept this scarf, and may it ever prove
A tender type of Roshervillian love.
THE LITERATURE OF TEA.
We have received an extremely friendly circular from a dealer, on
the subject of Tea; in which we are amiably assisted in our selection,
by little hints that such a tea is “a grateful tea,” another “a matured
tea,” and a third “a tea possessed of great virtues.” We admire grati-
tude wherever it is to be found, and “a grateful tea" must be a very
desirable sort of thing to cultivate. “A matured tea" cannot be such
an intrinsically meritorious tea; for “maturity” is a merely physical
accident, dependent on longevity. By the way, we are a little amused
at the endless degrees of comparison which the relative merits of teas
will admit of ; for while we are referred to best tea at 3s. 4d., we are
led on to a superior at 3s. 8d., a very superior beyond that at 4s. 3d.,
and a tea in the highest perfection at 6s. 6d

a number of straws for teaching Young Egypt to suck the same.
He has the diet table of a Poor-Law Union, to convince his father of

COSTUMES FOR RAILWAY TRAVELLERS.
We understand that it is in
contemplation to provide, at all
the stations on the Eastern
Counties Railway, a dress
adapted for travellers along this
celebrated line, by which they
will be secured from the
sions that are continually hap-
pening.
Considering that padding is
not unfrequently resorted to,
for the purpose of improving
the figure, it would, we think, º, º
be quite reasonable to extend &/
the fashion to the purpose of -
protecting the limbs as well as
adding to their symmetry. We
are sure that if a good pair of
false calves for the Eastern
Counties could be got up at a
reasonable price, there would be
a very great demand for the
article, among those who risk
their legs whenever they set their foot in a carriage on the line
alluded to. The public would have no objection to a slight addition to the
fares, for the purpose of insuring something like protection against
accident.
The tariff of the Company might be so varied as to allow of the “first
class, with paddings” being available at a small extra cost; while the
“second class, with calves,” could be something lower; and for the
benefit of the humbler passengers, the third class might be charged
sixpence extra “with knee-caps.”

THE BRITISH LION.
THE Protectionists having used the British Lion almost entirely up
in his natural state, have at length been seized with the happy idea of
bringing him forward in a new light, by making a black of him. The
success of the Ethiopian dodge has been so great, that every provincial
town has got a party of soot-smeared melodists. The process has at
last been applied to the British Lion, who has roared already till he
was nearly black in the face over the downfall of the Corn Laws, with-
out producing any effect. His patrons have therefore determined to
try the effect of actual blackening, so that if the animal cannot
command respect, he may at least inspire a feeling of alarm ; and the
British Lion has been transformed into an object familiarly known to
juveniles as a “Bogy.” Sugar is to be the question on which the
British Lion is to come out in his new character. Every philan-
thropic heart will, it is expected, bound against every waistcoat
at the bare idea of seeing the British Lion reduced to the condition of
a zoological nigger. The noble animal brought down to the state of
the black slave, is more than patriotism can bear, and the Protection-
lists will call upon every one to seize the British flag and wipe out the
black stain from the British Lion's countenance. The trick is a bold
one, but the next week or two will show whether it is to prove suc-
cessful.

Secrets worth Enowing.
WHAT is done with the Secret Service Money There is a trifle of
39,000l. voted every year for secret services. As none of this money
comes into our pocket, we have a perfect right to inquire where it goes
to. We recollect there was a secret department in the Post Office.
Pray, have there been any prizes distributed for breaking seals;
—premiums awarded to the clerks who were the best hands at steaming
the “wafer?” Let the services be what they may, the nature of them
cannot be very commendable, or else there would not be so much
secrecy about them.

THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
M | S S R O B | N S O N C R U S O E.
CHAPTER W.
Y RUMMAGING with all the
earnestness and intelligence
of my sex—and who, when
she likes, can rummage like a
woman 2–I discovered, in
the steward's store cabin, a
crate full of life-preservers;
a sufficient number to have
saved the lives of the crew of
what I think on the voyage I
once heard called a three-
decker. How they came to
be forgotten in the hour of
our peril, is only to be ac-
counted for by the frequent
} truth, that we can rarely put
our hands upon anything
when we are in a hurry for
it. (The reader who has ever
mislaid her scissors, or any
particular ball of cotton, will
at once understand me.)
Now, the life-preservers were
exactly of the same sort as
the one I found upon the
beach. It immediately oc-
curred to me, that by filling
some fifty or more of them
with air, and tying them together with tight string, I might make what is called a raft, upon
which I might safely deposit the trunks, the band-boxes, and other valuables. With this thought
I set to work; beginning with all my power to blow up every single article. Exhausted as I had
been by the terrors of the previous night, this was no easy task. But perseverance was always
my motto—as it should be that of every young woman setting out in life for a husband—and
though I had had but a poor breakfast, I succeeded in perfectly well blowing up every one of the
articles, and then flung every one of them overboard. Recruiting myself with another horn of
eau-de-cologne and water, and some potted anchovies, found in the captain's cupboard, I again set
to work to finish my task. I descended the ship's side, and with my preserver still about my
waist, with some tight string bound every piece of buoyant India-rubber close together. Returning
to the ship I threw overboard a patent water-bed, which subsequently Ilaid upon the life-preservers,
and very snug and comfortable it looked. I then moved trunk by trunk and box by box from
the ship upon the raft ; and who can know, who can understand, my delight, when I perceived
that every box, though trusted to uncertain NEPTUNE, remained as dry as a bone ! For the sea
was like glass : there was not spray enough to straighten the curls of a mermaid.
Whilst thus employed, securing my own boxes, and the boxes of the other lady passengers,
I cast my eyes towards the shore. The tide, I perceived, had risen, and was carrying away my
gown, with all its flounces. I felt a momentary pang; but, looking at the boxes on the raft,
permitted myself to be comforted. Having first secured all the articles of wearing apparel, my
next thought was to provide myself with a sufficient store of food. A few sides of bacon—
stowed away in the steward's cabin—half-a-dozen hams, and all the pickles and preserves, with
twenty packages of Embden Groats (for how, I thought, could I bear existence without, now
and then, my gruel !) were, with much pain and labour, discovered, and safely placed upon the
raft. A very beautiful mahogany case of surgical instruments—the Ramo Samee had advertised
to carry a surgeon-providentially attracted my notice. This I also secured ; and happy was
it that I did so.
My next thought was to secure some weapons to protect me against the bears and lions that
might already be in the island, or the savages that might visit it. The captain's pistols were in
his cabin; and as nobody saw me, I took them down, without even attempting to scream—which,
I have no doubt, I should have done had anybody been present. A canister of powder, and a
bag of shot about as big as pins'-heads, next rewarded my scrutinising vigilance. I will not
stay to number all the things secured, (many of them will immediately arise to the recollection
of every housewife,) but state, that as I thought my raft pretty well furnished, I had nothing
more to do than—as I had heard the sailors observe—shove off.
I again descended from the vessel, and was about to cut the string that secured the raft to
the ship's side, when—the thought flashed upon me, and as I may say, with its brightness
illuminated the very depths of my being—when I remembered that I had no looking-glass 1
A woman, nursed in the lap, and dandled upon the knees of luxury, without a looking-glass :
Imagine it—dwell upon it—is it possible for fate, in its worst malignity, more cruelly to punish
her ? When at home, with every blessing about me, I thought nothing of the chief delight, the
happiness of sitting two or three hours before my mirror, trying here a patch and there a patch.
Now limiting the furtive wanderings of an eyebrow—and now making pretty experiments with
my hair, for all the world as they practise in Woolwich marshes—for more certain killing. I
had heard something about “painting the
rose, and giving a perfume to the violet,”
and every morning, for two hours at least,
determined to try if it couldn't be done. I
shall not, at this lapse of time, be accused
of vanity when I declare that very often,
as I then believed, I succeeded to a miracle.
To think of the looking-glass, and again
to be on the ship's deck was, I may say,
the same thing ! As the poet says,
“Like the darting swallow " I fled into
the lady's cabin, for there, I recollected,
was a large gilt-framed mirror, nailed to
the wall, with lion's claws (doves, not lions,
ought to support looking-glasses; for what,
in her innocence, knows woman of claws 7)
standing upon nothing. How to detach it,
for it seemed to have been nailed up by a
giant l Rummaging about, Ifound a chisel,
with which—I know not how long—I la-
boured. I shall never forget the various
expression of my features in that looking-
glass, as I worked and toiled. I looked
red, and black, and angry, and savage;
and still, in the very height and depth of
my despair, I could not help pausing and
asking if it could be possible that it was
the same Miss Robinson reflected in the
crystal, the very same that had so often
“painted the rose, and perfumed the violet.”
Again and again I thought I must leave
the glass to the mermaids. And then the
thought of breaking the glass, and at least
rescuing the fragments, rose within me.
And then I shuddered.
Nerved by a thimble-full of eau de cologne,
I resumed my task. How shall I describe
my emotions, when I felt the first nail
yield to the chisel ? My face—I caught a
look of myself—seemed to go off as it were
in one tremendous smile, (often as I have
|since practised for the same look, I never
| could touch it). Nail followed nail; and,
not to weary the reader—for such person
may be of the male sex—I folded the
| liberated mirror to my breast, as Ireleased
it from the wall. Had it not been a mirror
I should have considered its weight quite
insupportable; as it was, I felt it light—
light, as somebody says who knew nothing
about it—as vanity.
My next care was to place the glass
upon the raft. Verythick, and very violent,
were the beatings of my woman's heart as
I brought the mirror over the ship's side.
No words, though bright as rainbows, can
paint my feelings when I saw the glass
safely lowered among my other goods. I
sank upon the deck, and grateful tears ran,
like rain-drops on cottage casements, down
my cheeks. Finally recruiting myself for
my great effort—to land my goods—I
descended upon the raft—it bore me beau-
tifully; and it was not without some pride
that I gazed upon my valuables, so safely
stowed, my looking-glass included.
Taking an oar in my hand—I had once,
in an hour of childish hilarity, rowed a
boat upon a lake, somewhere near Hornsey,
so was not altogether unskilful in the
management of skulls—I paddled, as some
one once said to me (oh, memory ! and oh,
fate 1), “like a little duck as I was.”
Isteered towards a slit—a creek, I think
it’s called—in the shore ; to avoid the
billows that, big as feather-beds, were
rolling over the rocks. Then I trembled
for my raft ; felt cold and hot, and hot and

cold for my mirror. However, all went smoothly enough for a mile ;
and the more I paddled, the greater confidence I felt in my powers.
Keeping—pardon the unfeminine expression—a sharp look-out, I
steered and paddled on ; but knowing nothing of flats and shoals,
my raft suddenly run aground on the edge of a rock or something.
Imerely shifted my oar; and, summoning all the energies of my soul,
endeavoured to shove off. And I did so. But judge of my despair–
think of my horror . The raft violently moved, gave a sort of lurch :
it communicated motion to one article—then to the next—then to the
next—until, striking against my mirror, it sent it headlong (if I may
use the word) headlong into the sea After this loss, consider if you
can, what were my reflections !
THE HYDE-PARK CLOCK.
This dismal dial continues in the same state of hopeless want of
enlightenment. If the clock is incapable of managing the works with
which it is entrusted, let extra hands be put on immediately. It is,
however, only at night that the clock shows symptoms of indisposition,
for then an eruption breaks out all over the face, which exhibits such
confusion that even LAvATER would be puzzled to read its expression.
Who may be the illumer of this illuminated clock we do not know, but
it is enough to excite our ill-humour to see the dingy condition of this
once bright and happy-looking dial. It has, however, lost the smile
that once shed brilliance over its countenance. -
Such were our reflections as we passed by Hyde-Park-Corner a night
or two ago, when our feelings naturally took the form of the following
ballad :—
Oh I smile as thou wert wont to smile
Before the London air
Had black'd thy face, and for awhile
Left only darkness there.
Some gas, perchance, 'twere best to add—
One little extra jet;
With which—should some one wash your face—
You may be useful yet.
Oh I do not name departed clocks,
That were as bad as you :
Though the Horse-Guard's the public mocks,
With pale and sickly hue.
Perchance, by sitting up all night,
Weary and dull you get ;
But, with a little stronger light,
You may be useful yet.

ONE of those milk-and-watery assemblages of sickly sentimentalists
that are continually disgusting the manly mind and nauseating the
good old school, took place the other day, at the Eastern Institution,

mentalists, we need hardly say that their object was the abolition of
capital punishment. And yet, was it not a little unsentimental to de-
sire the cutting down of that fine old tree, the Gallows 7 In the chair
was MR. BRothERTON, M.P., who, with reference to the topic under

to love one another were at all incompatible with the practice of hang-

THE WELLINGTON STATUE AND THE ARCH.
It appears from the Times that SIR. R.INGL1s has obtained a parliamentary docu-
ment relating to the erection of the colossal statue of the DUKE of WELLINGTON on
the comparatively diminutive arch at Hyde-Park-Corner. The architect, MR.
BURTON, has remonstrated against the imposition of such a tremendous weight on a
place that never was intended to bear anything.
It certainly seems hard that when an architect has done his best to erect an arch
that shall be a monument of his abilities, some one else is permitted to spoil its effect
by raising some incongruous structure on the top of it. The authorities might as
well propose to put a fountain in full play on the top of GEORGE THE THIRD's head,
or stick a statue of QUEEN VICTORIA up to her knees in one of the Trafalgar basins.
We have not so much that is beautiful in art in the Great Metropolis, that we can
afford to disregard the old piece of advice to “let well alone;” and as the arch at
Hyde-Park-Corner is a very respectable structure, it is,too bad to allow the DUKE
of WELLINGTON to ride rough-shod over it.
gap his own weight will have occasioned.
DISTANT WIEW OF LONDON (TAKEN FROM PuTiNex HEATH).
According to the architect who built it, however, who ought to know best—the
deformity is not the worst that we have to dread from the proposed arrangement.
The probability is, that the whole concern will come down with a tremendous crash,
and that the Duke's horse will be found kicking and plunging about in the fearful
We seriously warn the public against
passing under the arch when the statue shall be placed at the top of it. We are not
very happy at mathematical calculation, but it strikes us very forcibly that as A. B.C
is to DEF, those who are not D EF to the voice of reason must allow it to be
as plain as A B C, that the arch cannot bear the weight of the statue. The effect of
the colossal monster towering at night over every other object in the metropolis,
will have a fearful effect upon the inhabitants of Lon-
don. We are sure that the WELLINGTON horse will
prove a night-mare to all who are compelled to sleep
within the capital. We say nothing about the expense
of the arrangement, which will make this metallic

SOCIETY FOR THE PREVENTION OF CRUELTY
TO SOLDIERS.
MEETINGs are held, and petitions presented, from
time to time, against flogging in the army ; in the
meanwhile, soldiers are whipped to death. The coster-
monger is limited in the application of the lash ; surely
the commanding officer might be restrained a little.
The donkey is a brute not so very much nobler than
the private. Now if a costermonger were to take his
donkey, tie it to a ladder nailed to a wall, and deliber-
ately whip the skin off the creature's back, the
miscreant would be fined, or sent to the treadmill, amid
the execrations of the mob. Yet thus may a court-
martial treat a fellow creature. But the one man is a
costermonger and a blackguard ; the others are officers
and gentlemen. Still even officers, and gentlemen to
boot, should not be allowed to behave exactly like fiends
incarnate.
The law should not suffer them to torture poor
soldiers to death. There really is required a MARTIN's
Act for the military. It is with the view of procuring
some such an enactment that we recommend the
formation of a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Soldiers. The Animals' Friend Society protects even
the Cat from man, but we want a Society for protecting

THE PAS DES DEESSES.]
THE engagement of TAGLIONI having caused a general promotion of
the principal danseuses at the Opera from mere mortals into God-
desses, a pas has been prepared for the exhibition of their celestial
qualities. St. LEoN, in the character of Paris, having secured a real
Ribstone, is supposed to prepare for the adjudication of that popular
pippin to the Goddess who deserves it best ; not on account of her
beauty, but by virtue of her dancing. By the bye, if dancing were to
be the test of superiority among the Olympian females, why did not
TERPsichore walk, or rather caper in, and settle the business 2 The
celestial contest was, however, confined to the old recognised trio, JUNO,
VENUs, and MINERVA, who all tried their best to twist themselves into
favour. Nobody got the apple at last, which ought to have been cut
into slices and divided amongst them, while PERROT should have been
allowed the stalk for the trouble he took in arranging the divertissement.
Bouquets, of course, flew in all directions, and there were ample
materials for a flower-show. The Pas des Déesses is expected to put at
least fifty pounds a-night into the pockets of the Coyent Garden
dealers, until the end of the opera season. The scene at the conclusion
was perhaps worth all the rest, for a desperate effort was made by the
three Goddesses, to induce PERRot to come forward to receive the
cheers of the audience. He was at length dragged on by main force,
when CERIto, insisting on his going down upon his knees, began
flowering his head with a shower of garlands. This interesting
struggle having continued for some time, Les Déesses retired to their
dressing-rooms.

THE difficulty of finding suitable sides of the House for the various
members, since the recent fusion and confusion of parties, has induced
an ingenious individual to construct a moveable chair, which, by being
wheeled from side to side, may become a Ministerial bench, an Oppo-
sition bench, or a cross bench, at a moment's notice. This curious
arrangement will quite obviate the difficulty that is now so often expe-
rienced by members not knowing where to take a position : for
circumstances might cause them to be desirous of voting with the
Government and against the Government on the very same evening.
By the new contrivance, they can change sides with every fresh motion,
if they are desirous of doing so. Parliamentary conductors must of
course be appointed to carry out the arrangement, so that when a
member feels he must suddenly join the Opposition, he has only to hail
the proper officer and desire to be set down immediately on the side.

THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
M | S S R O B | N S O N C R U S O E.
CHAPTER WI.
INCE that beautiful looking-glass was gone for
ever, for never having learned to dive, it was
impossible that I could hope to recover it—I
still had hope. I remembered the number of
lady passengers we had brought out, and felt
comforted. There must be, I thought, twenty
| more looking-glasses in the wreck; though not
7 such a love as the mirror I had lost.
- Having pushed my raft as far near the land
as possible, I fastened it with a string to a large
stone, believing that, as the tide went down, the
} raft would be left upon the shore. I had not
calculated falsely. So it happened. My next
work, however, was to look about me. Where
was I? In what corner of the earth 2 It could
not be Peru, for I saw not a morsel of gold upon
the beach; it was not one of the Spice Islands, for not a single nutmeg
was to be seen upon any of the trees. Was it the Canaries 2—flights
of birds flew past me; but they flew so high, it was impossible for me
to discern if there were any canaries among them. And here—I
must confess it—I felt some anger towards the respected principals of
my Blackheath Boarding-School. I have said that I was nominally
taught the Use of the Globes; my learning was down in the bill, and
paid for every quarter. I had been taught to talk about California
and Behring's Straits, and the Euxine and Patagonia, as if they were
all so many old acquaintance ; and yet I knew not if at that moment
I might not be upon some of them. And then I sighed, and felt that
it isn't for a young lady to know anything of the world, because she
sits with the Globe in her hand two hours a day. And I felt too
that if I ever should have a daughter—and how my eyes did sadly
wander about that uninhabited tract—I should not conclude that she
knew anything of geography, because I had paid for it.
However, I was resolved to look about me, and explore the country.
Whereupon, I waded into the water, and removed one of the light
trunks, and one of the bonnet-boxes. Of course, I could not go out
without first dressing myself. My mortification was very great, though
very foolish—for what could I have expected?—to find the box locked.
Fortunately, it was a hasp lock; I therefore sat down upon the beach,
and with a large stone hammered away until I had broken it. With some
natural anxiety, Ilifted the lid. The first thing that burst upon my view
was a very pretty muslin—worked with a green sprig—a nice morning
thing. I remembered the lady to whom the box belonged, and felt
that the gown could not fit me--it must be at least half-a-quarter too
wide in the waist. But I felt half-comforted, and much distressed with
the thought that nobody would see me. I therefore began my toilette;
and, considering my many difficulties, felt—for though I had no glass,
we feel when we look well—I felt myself interesting. I contrived to
pin in the gown, hiding it where most wanted with a primrose-coloured
China crape shawl. Dressing my hair in bands—for, though from
childhood it always curled naturally, it could not be expected to
curl so soon after so much salt water—I put on a beautiful chip
bonnet, (I am certain the unfortunate soul had brought it out with
her ready-trimmed for a hasty marriage). I was not troubled with
the shoes; for, by some strange fatality, even in England I never
could get a shoe small enough for me; and the lady whose shoes I
was doomed to wear had a foot like—but no ; never while I live will
I speak ill of the dead. I said my hair would not curl. Let me
correct myself. One lock always could, particularly well. And this
lock—do what I might—always would show itself just under my
bonnet. And so it happened now.
Among the many little elegances—which I will not stop to name,
for they will find names in the bosom of every lady—discovered in the
box, I found some court plaister. This was a blessing. I felt that
even among tigers—if there were tigers—I should not be deprived
of my daily beauty-spot. I also found a very handsome shot-silk
parasol, fresh from the shop, wrapt in its virgin paper. Now, I never
thought too much of my beauty—no woman can. But, from the
loveliness of my complexion, people had called me, from a child, Little
Dresden China. Therefore, my emotions on discovering the parasol,
the sun being at the time—perhaps two hundred in the shade, may, in
the words of a great public writer, “be more easily conceived than
described.”
Being as well dressed as my dreadful circumstances would permit,
I felt that I might venture out. As, however, the country might be
inhabited—(my heart beat thicker at the thought)—I felt it necessary
to be prepared for the worst. For what I knew, it might be an island
not far from Constantinople, and—the pure blood of a free-born
English maiden burned in my veins—I would prefer death to the
captivity of the Harem, or (according to the last editions) Hareem.
At the thought, I remembered that I had been suckled at the same
breast with the British Lion, and knew the proper moment when—to
die
My sister readers—and these pages are written for them alone—
cannot therefore but applaud my resolution when I inform them that
I took with me (placing them like sleeping vipers in my bosom) my
pair of scissors, and in my right hand (my left carried my parasol)
one of the captain's pistols. If the country was not inhabited by
Hottentots or Hindoos—I always had a horror of a black skin,
whereas there is something romantic in the true olive—there might
be lions and tigers, leopards and crocodiles.
I therefore began my morning walk, never once turning round,
though now and then—how deceitful is fancy —I thought I heard
footsteps following me. They might be men : but even then the
lessons of my dear mother were not forgotten—I never looked behind
me : I tripped a little quicker, unconsciously lowering my parasol.
I began to ascend a hill, I should say quite as high as Highgate.
Arrived at the top, I turned round and round, and wherever I turned
saw nothing but the sea heaving about me.
island.
Was it inhabited 2 There was a beautiful double opera-glass in
the box I had opened. Why had I not brought it with me 2 If
inhabited, I might have beheld the smoke of chimneys ; the dancing,
perhaps, what indecorous, what different dancing to the aerial
movements of HER MAJESTY's Theatre—of the benighted savages.
No : it was plain I was alone. Alone ! My eye rested upon my
sprigged muslin—my feelings flew back to my white chip—and I
wept.
I descended the hill; and at the bottom, that was skirted with
some thick bushes, I heard a noise. In a moment, and with a courage
that at any other time I should have thought it impossible for me to
possess, I turned my head aside, and presenting my pistol, fired.
Something, with a heavy bump, fell a few yards from me. Before I
ventured to look, I asked myself—“Is it a tiger?—is it an eagle 2" I
turned round, and saw it was neither one nor the other. It was a
bird of an enormous size, with large fleshy knobs about its head and
neck. Had I seen such a bird before ? I had been to MR. Wom B-
well's ; he had nothing like it. And then I recollected that I had
seen something like the bird in London, at Christmas. In a word,
after much deep thought and patient examination, I discovered the
bird to be a turkey—a wild turkey. At least, I thought, here is a
dinner. But how to get it home 2 “Home !” so sweet is the word;
it follows us everywhere. My “home” was where my boxes were.
“How to get it home !”
“If anybody,” I thought, forgetting my desolation, “was to see me
carrying a turkey, could I ever look the world in the face again f"
Instinctively I looked round and round that nobody might behold me,
and at length lifted up the turkey by the neck. I do not profess to
be a correct judge of weights and measures—I never could learn 'em
at school, but I am very much mistaken if the turkey did not weigh
at least seventy pounds. It was most oppressive to carry ; but I
thought how nice it would be when cooked.
Cooked I Who was to cook it 2 I, who never even made a custard
—because I thought it low—how was I to cook such a tremendous
animal as a turkey ! However, I walked on—wearily enough—until
I came back to my boxes. The tide had left my raft upon dry land
I would therefore,"I thought, prepare my dinner. I knew that the
turkey must be picked. But how 2 There was a dressing-case in
one of the boxes. I had secured that. I therefore searched for it ;
and taking from it a pair of tweezers, sat me down upon the beach,
and began to pick my turkey.

PUNCH AND HIS PRINCE
AT LIVERPOOL.
URING a considera-
ble time all Liverpool
has been in a state
of excitement on the
subject of the con-
templated visit of
PRINCE ALBERT; the
local papers have
been filled with inte-
resting announce-
ments of prepara-
tions in progress. We
have been told how
STUBBs had been
summoned to attend
with his harmonic
band; and though it
is true we never
heard of Sruºns, nor caught the faintest
echo of his harmonic band, still, coupled
as the statement was with the startling
intelligence that ATRINs had received
orders to prepare a splendid display of fire-
works, there was strong evidence of a de-
termination “to do the thing” regardless
of cost on the part of the Liverpudlians.
We were apprised, moreover, through the
public press, that the bill of fare was
being printed a fortnight in advance, and
we only wonder that in their zeal the inha-
bitants did not insist upon having the din-
ner cooked a week before it was wanted.
A state bed was ordered direct from London ; as if the Prince had
feathered his nest so beautifully in the great metropolis that he could
not repºse, even for a night or two, upon provincial goose, though
surely there can be nothing much softer than the geese of Liverpool.
Some people, however, cannot sleep in a strange bed, and Prince
ALBERT is doubtless one of the number ; though it is odd that he did
not, calculate on the soporific quality of the speeches sufficiently to
enable him to have dispensed with the trouble of bringing down with
him his own bed and bedding.
The tickets to be issued to the déjeuner were made the subject of
competition among the lithographic artists of the town, nearly all of
whom sent in a design, and that of GEoRGE SMITH & Co. was decided
upon. We can fancy the splendid field for imagination which a design
for a ticket to a breakfast must have presented to the artists of Liver-
pool. A breakfast-cup rampant, between a couple of muffins couchant,
would have, no doubt, rushed into the mind of one or more of the com-
petitors; or perhaps, Commerce sailing round the world in a slop-
basin would have suggested itself as an appropriate heading to a ticket
for the déjeuner.
The silver trowel to be used by the Prince was also the subject of
considerable discussion, until MR. Dismoke, of Bold Street, threw his
heart and soul completely into it, and turned out an article of the most
exquisite workmanship. Even the mortar was to be piled up into a
handsome pat, like so much butter, and stamped with the arms of
England on one side, while the other was to have a portrait of the
Prince going down to posterity in a bricklayer's hod, carried by
BRITANNIA.
The only drawback to the pleasure of preparation consisted in the
alleged favouritism shown by the Mayor in sending out invitations to
the persons intended to be present at the ceremony. It is said that His
Worship evinced a desire to give way to certain prejudices in his
selection of guests, and the result was a regular heartburning among
the inhabitants. It is a fearful thing when a whole city is seized with
heartburn ; but we trust the application of the usual remedies may

people. It seems to us that on this principle HER MAJESTY ought to
have now and then a pickpocket to dine with her at Windsor; for it
might fairly be said, “Why exclude any class of her subjects 2 She
rules over a mixed people, among whom there are rogues as well as
honest characters.”
All the preliminaries having been at length arranged, the Mayor and
the civic authorities rushed to the station to receive his Royal Highness
upon his arrival by the railway. He addressed a few complimentary
words to each, and very ingeniously varied every separate speech
which he made to the crowd of functionaries that surrounded him.
With a happy felicity of expression, he contrived to give to a simple
sentence on the subject of the weather, at least fifty different forms of
phraseology; and knowing the tendency of Englishmen to talk about
the weather, his Royal Highness made it the grand topic of conversa-
tion with the people of Liverpool.
The Prince was next escorted to the Judges' lodging, to see his bed-
room, and to get the dust wiped off his boots, as well as to run a comb
through his hair to restore the “parting,” which had become confused
by the length of the journey. Our own reporter—the same who got
ducked a year or two ago—informs us that PRINCE ALBERT took a clean
collar from between the leaves of “BRADshAw's Guide,” which makes a
very compact travelling-case for those who do not journey about with
extensive wardrobes. For the accuracy of this statement we will not
vouch, but it is not by any means improbable.
Having left the Judges' lodgings, the Prince repaired
to the Town-Hall, where the address was to have been
read to him by the Mayor, but the poor Mayor com-
menced in a nervous whisper, and after stammering
over a few words, amid loud cries of “Speak up !”
- handed to the Recorder the precious document. A
--- scene of fearful confusion and consternation ensued
among the members of the Corporation, some of whom
kept nudging the Mayor and muttering “Go on,”
while others were pulling him back, exclaiming, “No, no ; ” and a few
were heard to reiterate, “Yes, yes, he’ll get through it ; now then,
take courage, Hodgson.”
The Prince beginning to exhibit signs of impatience
at this extraordinary scene, the Recorder, giving the
Mayor a slight push, which sent him into the back-
ground, proceeded to read the address, which has
already appeared in the newspapers. It is a very
powerful document, stating that “Liverpool must receive
an impulse,” &c., &c., &c., and the answer, in the same
spirit, expresses a hope that “Liverpool will,” &c., &c.,
&c. On his Royal Highness's attention being drawn to
the box in which the address was inclosed, he remarked facetiously to
his Secretary, MR.ANson, that “the box was the best part of it.” This
remark was not overheard by the Mayor and Corporation, who were
having a private squabble about the bungling business that their chief
had so far made of it.
The Prince then went to open the new Dock, and an enormous crowd
had assembled, expecting to see His Royal Highness move back the
flood-gates with his own hand, or do some other feat of dexterity, for
the purpose of opening the Dock-yard. It was, however, all plain
sailing ; for he merely steamed round the centre, amid the cheers of
the spectators, who seemed a little disappointed that His Royal High-
ness had not, at all events, “lent a hand” in pulling back the Dock
bridge to effect an opening.
Soon after three, the Prince was taken to a déjeúner in one of the
warehouses, which was fitted up with long tables, constructed of planks
supported on tallow casks. A quantity of sacks of corn made the
cushions for the seats, being covered with red cloth for the occasion, and
the Mayor was elevated, as Chairman, on a cask of free-labour sugar.
The déjeitner consisted of every delicacy at the chief table, dwindling
down towards the lower end of the warehouse into a much humbler
kind of entertainment. At the conclusion of the repast, the health of
the QUEEN was proposed by the Mayor, who expressed a hope that the
feelings of respect, duty, and loyalty of the people of Liverpool would
be done up into a parcel, and conveyed by the Prince direct to HER
MAJESTY. His Royal Highness, by an assenting smile, seemed to under-
take the office of light-porter between the Liverpudlians and their

august Sovereign. Among his luggage will no doubt be found a parcel
labelled “Liverpool Feelings. With care This side upwards.” In
consenting to become the PickFoRD of private life, His Royal Highness
showed that he was not above uniting himself with the commercial
classes of his country.
The next toast was PRINCE ALBERT's own health, in acknowledging
which, he declared that “the scene he then saw would never be effaced
from his memory.”
His Royal Highness, after having seen a few sights in the town,
repaired to THE BANQUET, which was on a splendid scale of profusion.
The chickens seem to have conspired with the lobsters in a desire to
render the salads of which they are respectively the heroes in every
way worthy of the great occasion. The capons appear to have vied
with the ducks in that spirit of loyalty which induced them to grow
to that enormous size which rendered them prodigies at the table of
their Prince and their demofisher. Such devotion in farm-yards was
never before known, for it is a fact that the feathered residents had
long been straining every nerve to get fat, in order to qualify them-
selves for sacrifice at this festivity. The toasts were almost the same
as at the dejeúner, but the speech of PRINCE ALBERT being an after-
dinner one, was longer and warmer than that he had made in the
morning.
At twenty-five minutes past twelve, the dinner-party broke up, and
the Prince went home to sleep upon his own bed, which had been put
up at the Judges' lodgings. In the evening ATKINs came out, not very
brilliantly, with a partial display of fireworks, and a sort of chequered
exhibition of loyalty occurred, in the shape of a few scattered illumi-
nations over the principal thoroughfares. Here and there a blaze of
fervour burst out in the letters “P.A.,” when a dingy house without any
illumination, next door, threw a kind of wet blanket over the enthu-
siasm of a more amiably disposed neighbour.
In the morning the whole city was on the tiptoe, and, indeed, we
are almost justified in saying not merely tiptoe but on positive stilts,
for the grand ceremony of the week, the laying of the first stone of the
Home for Sailors. A procession had been for a long time set forth in
large printed particulars, but we must confess that though dignified by
large capital letters the procession seemed to us to promise better in
quantity than in quality.
It began with our old friends the PolicEMEN, who were dis-
tinguished—we suppose for the sake of variety—as FIRE PolicEMEN in
the procession at Liverpool. We then had a band, followed by Blue-
Coat Boys, with more bands and a party of Druids—lent, we suppose,
from the Theatre, which had lately been performing Norma with an
augmented chorus. Several other trades, in parties of a thousand and
five hundred, were then followed by
THE TROWEL
and
THE PRINCE ; -
but it was generally believed that the Trowel, as an object of curiosity,
got rather the best of it. The cheers for the Prince were very enthu-
siastic ; but the cheers for the Trowel exceeded anything of any kind
ever heard at any time anywhere. The Prince, on arriving at the spot,
gave the first stone a tremendous blow, and it was remarked, that a
thing of the kind was never before laid with so much energy. Having
taken a little bit of mortar from the prepared pat, he laid it on
tolerably thick; and the ceremony being concluded, he hastened to
the Station, preparatory to resuming his own station by the side of
R MAJESTY.

THE British Lion takes the liberty to ask whether he is not entitled
to a testimonial He has worked hard, has growled whenever he was
wanted, and was never slow in wagging his tail, when called upon, at a
moment's notice. He has saved the British constitution oftener than
he likes to mention; has carried elections innumerable, which, but for
him, must have fallen to the ground; and he has been the bosom friend
of the Protectionists, the terror of the Radicals, and the cheerful com-
panion of the Whigs and Tories for more centuries than he can
recollect. . Under all these circumstances, the British Lion cannot help
thinking he is entitled to something. His voice, once so loud that it
could be heard from one end of the kingdom to the other, is no longer
so good; and his tail, once so strong that it has often knocked over a
Member's seat merely by wagging, has dwindled away absolutely to
nothing.
After a long life spent in standing up for his country, the British
Lion is anxious for a little rest. He will not further enlarge upon his
claims, but he will say, if in this shower of tributes and testimonials
one does not drop down upon his head, to make him comfortable in his
old age, he shall retire with disgust from the platform of public life,
and never roar or wag his tail again. N.B.-Subscriptions to be sent
to Exeter Hall. Nothing but bank-notes received.
Scarcity of British Bricks,
No less than 60,000 bricks have been imported from China. This is
a curious instance of the extent of the building mania, when bricks
have to be sent all the way from China. There will be a scarcity of
mortar next, and the time will probably come when English houses
will be built with Chinese bricks, put together with Poo-Loo cement.
“Hard of Hearing."
A NIGHT or two since, Lord BRough AM declared that “he had heard
nothing of the potato disease !” MR. CURTIs, the aurist, waited upon
his Lordship the next morning, and has from that time been engaged

opening them—to the misfortunes of others.

We are happy to present our readers with a plan of the chain of
mountains which the hardy traveller has to pass in making the ascent
of Westminster Bridge. It will be observed that some of the links in
the chain are longer than others, but this only diversifies the scenery,
and makes the journey twice as interesting by making it twice as
long. There is always a certain pride and enjoyment in surmounting
danger, and the traveller, in crossing Westminster Bridge, will have these
pleasurable feelings materially enhanced as he views a fresh prospect at
every turn, of falling in or tumbling over. The beautiful precipices,
also, which occur at every step—and which may be called the breaks
in the chain—invest the scenery with a boldness and a depth which
are not to be met with on any other bridge. This chain is shortly to
be broken up, but as long as it is in sufficient repair to hang together,
guides are to be stationed at the foot of each mountain, to conduct
travellers safely over, and finger-posts are to be erected at certain
distances, directing the tourist what path he is to follow in climbing
the next arch. In the centre a grand hospital will probably be built,
where the weary cab-horse may rest his bruised knees, and the
venturesome omnibus stop for a fresh pole or a missing wheel.
A Flag to be Bold.
AFLAG-a little worn—with “No SURRENDER" inscribed upon it, is
offered to the collectors of national relics. The flag has been used in
the campaigns of the Corn Law and the Sugar Questions, and will now
go at a price very much reduced from its original cost. Should the flag
be again required in any future service, a liberal sum will be given for
the loan. Apply for terms to the DUKE of RICHMOND, post-paid.
QTije 3xiber 3ſotball Company.
PRovisionALLY REGISTERED.—CAPITAL, £1,000,000.
This Company has been formed for the purpose of supplying a
demand, which may now be confidently expected to arise, for water
from this celebrated river. It is scarcely necessary to hint at a fashion
which must necessarily be set by an illustrious example; but the
Directors of the Association feel assured that no christening in hig
life will now be considered complete without the article which the
Company has been formed to import. The water will be contained in
large stone bottles, capsuled, and the lower end of the cork marked
with the Company's initials, in order to prevent imposition. As it is
the determination of the Company to place this water within the reach
of the humblest classes, they have made arrangements for its sale at a
moderate price, extending thus to the lowly village church a luxury
which has hitherto been restricted to the Royal Chapel.
The People and the Parks.
MERE mechanics have, of late, been excluded from the Parks. The
vulgar creatures, absolutely working, and, in this weather, perspiring
for their daily bread, have been thought unfit to mingle with the
genteel middle classes, that sit at desks, keep shops, or travel with

SIGNS OF THE TIMES.
SIR Robert PEEL said, in his speech about Art-Unions, that “there
was not a man who had a bad picture who did not endeavour to get
rid of it by a raffle.” Why not try the same means, then, for getting
rid of the imitation Holmen in the National Gallery A spirited
raffle at five shillings a share would certainly induce all the Licensed
Victuallers to take a chance, in the hope of turning it into a public.

PUNCH, OR THE
59
LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SNOBS OF ENGLAND.
BY one or THEMselves.
CHA1" xXIII.-ON RADICAL SNOBS.
As the principles of Punch are emi-
** nently Conservative, it might be
I had thought of letting off the poor
Radical Snobs altogether; for perse-
cution they had enough in former
days, Heaven knows, when to be a
Radical was to be considered a Snob,
and every flunkey who could use his
pen was accustomed to prate about
“the great unwashed,” and give
himself airs at the expense of “the
greasy multitude.” But the multi-
tude have the laugh on their side of
late years, and can listen to these
pretty jokes with good-humour.
Perhaps, after all, there is no better
friend to Conservatism than your out-
rageous Radical Snob. When a man
preaches to you that all noblemen are tyrants, that all clergymen are
hypocrites and liars, that all capitalists are scoundrels banded together
in an infamous conspiracy to deprive the people of their rights, he
creates a wholesome revulsion of feeling in favour of the abused par-
ties, and a sense of fair play leads the generous heart to take a
side with the object of unjust oppression.
For instance, although I hate military flogging, as the most brutal
and odious relic we have left of the wicked torturing old times, and
have a private opinion that soldiers of crack dragoon regiments are
not of necessity the very wisest of human creatures, yet when I see
QUACKLEY the Coroner giving himself sham airs of patriotism, and
attacking the men for the crime of the system—(of which you and I
are as much guilty as ColoneL WHYTE, unless we do our utmost to
get it repealed)—I find myself led over to the brow-beaten side, and
inclincă to take arms against QUACKLEY. Yesterday, a fellow was
bawling by my windows an account of the trial at Hounslow, and “the
hinfamous tyranny of a brootle and savidge Kurnal, hall to be ad for
the small charge of Won Apny.” Was that fellow a radical patriot,
think you, or a radical Snob ; and which was it that he wanted—to
put down flogging or to get money?
What was it that made SIR Robert PEEL so popular of late days
in the country 2 I have no question but that it was the attacks of
certain gentlemen in the House of Commons. Now they have left off
abusing him, somehow we are leaving off loving him. Nay, he made
a speech last week, about the immorality of lotteries and the wicked-
ness of Art-Unions, which caused some kind friends to say—“Why,
the man is just as fond of humbug and solemn cant as ever.”
This is the use that radical Snobs, or all political Snobs are made
for, to cause honest folks to rally over to the persecuted side: and I
often think, that if the world goes on at its present rate—the people
carrying all before them ; the aristocracy always being beaten after
the ignominious simulacrum of a battle; the Church bowled down ; the
revolution triumphant ; and (who knows 7) the monarchy shaken—
I often think old Punch will find himself in opposition as usual, and
| deploring the good old days and the advent of Radicalism along with
poor old Mrs. Gamp and Mrs. Harris.
Perhaps the most dangerous specimen of the Radical Snob to be
found in the three kingdoms is that branch of Snobs called Young
Ireland, who have been making a huge pother within the last fort-
night, and who have found a good deal of favour in this country of
late years.
I don't know why we have been so fond of this race; except that it
wrote pretty poems, and murdered the Saxons in melodious iambics,
and got a character for being honest somehow, in opposition to old
MR. O'Connell, to whom the English prejudice denied that useful
quality. We are fond of anything strange here, and perhaps our
taste is not very classical. We like Tom THUMB ; we like the Yankee
melodists; we like the American Indians ; and we like the Irish
howl. Young Ireland has howled to considerable effect in this
country ; and the SHAN VAN Voght, and the men of '98,
have been decidedly popular. If the O'BRIEN, and the O'Toole, and
the O'Dowd, and the O'WHACK, and the McLHolligAN would take
St. James's Theatre, the war-cry of Aodh O Nyal, and the Battle of
the Blackwater, and the Galloglass Chorus might bring in a little
audience even in the hot weather.
But this I know, that if any party ever fulfilled the condition of
Snobs, Young Ireland has. Is ludicrous conceit Snobbishness 2 Is
absurd arrogance, peevish ill-temper, utter weakness accompanied by
|tremendous braggadocity, Snobbishness 2 Is TIBBs a Snob or not ?
thought that anything we could say
about Radical Snobs would bear an
impress of prejudice and bigotry, and
When the little creature threatens to thrash ToM CRIB ; and when
ToM, laughing over his great broad shoulders, walks good-humouredly
away, is TIBBs a Snob, who stands yelling after him and abusing him,
—or a hero, as he fancies himself to be 2
A martyr without any persecutors is an utter Snob ; a frantic
dwarf who snaps his fingers (as close as he can lift them) under the
nose of a peaceable giant, is a Snob ; and the creature becomes a
most wicked and dangerous Snob when he gets the ear of people more
ignorant than himself, inflames them with lies, and misleads them
into ruin. Young Ireland shrieking piteously with nobody hurting
him, or waving his battle-axed hand on his battlemented wall, and
bellowing his war-cry of Bug-Aboo—and roaring out melodramatic
tom-foolery—and fancying himself a champion and a hero, is only a
ludicrous little humbug ; but when he finds people to believe his
stories, that the liberated Americans are ready to rally round the
green banner of Erin—that the battalioned invincibility of France is
hastening to succour the enemy of the Saxon, he becomes a Snob so
dangerous and malevolent, that Mr. Punch loses his usual jocularity
in regarding him, and would see him handed over to proper authorities
without any ill-timed compassion.
It was this braggart violence of soul that roused the Punchine
wrath against MR. O'Connell, when, mustering his millions upon the
green hills of Erin, he uttered those boasts and menaces which he is
now proceeding, rather demurely, to swallow. And as for pitying the
Young Irelanders any longer because they are so honest, because they
write such pretty verses, because they would go to the scaffold for their
opinions—our hearts are not tender enough for this kind of commiser-
ation. A set of young gentlemen might choose to publish a paper
advocating arson, or pointing out the utility of murder—a regard for
our throats and our property would lead us not to pity these interest-
ing young patriots too tenderly ; and we have no more love for Young
Ireland and her leaders and their schemes, than for regenerate England
under the martyrs THISTLEwood and INGs.
A SITE TOO BAD.
(Note from the Duke of Wellington's Statue.)
“FIELD MARSHAL THE DUKE of WELLINGTON's STATUE presents its
compliments to the DUKE of RUTLAND and the Committee for the
erection of the Statue to the Duke. F. M. the Duke's Statue is not
accustomed to interfere with what does not concern it; but the pro-
posal to place it on the top of MR. BURTON's Arch concerns it very
much indeed.
“The DUKE of WELLINGTON's Statue presumes that the DUKE of
RUTLAND and the Committee, in proposing to set it over the gateway
in question, were actuated by the desire to cater to the amusement of
the public, by affording it a perpetual laughing-stock.
“If such was the intention of the Committee and its Chairman, it is
the opinion of the Statue that they could have carried out their design
more effectually than by the plan they determined on.
“The Duke's Statue does not think that the topof the gateway opposite
to Apsley House is quite the most ridiculous situation for it in
London. It imagines it might look rather more absurd if placed over
Temple Bar. The Eddystone Lighthouse would be a site still more
eligible.”

PRIDE FEELS NO PAIN.
Arabella. “Oh ' Don't be Ridiculous, FREDERick!
For That's A GREAT DEAL too LARGE.”
It isN'T THE Shoe,
THE TWO SIDES OF THE QUESTION.
WE print these communications without comment :—
No. I.-A PLANTER To PUNCH.
- “Cheltenham.
“I don't expect much sympathy from you. I'll tell you why.
When my medical attendant, at Cheltenham last year, recommended
what he called “peristaltic motion of the lower viscera” for my liver
complaint, (for I've not lived in Berbice eighteen years for nothing,
and yet there wasn't a planter in the colony more moderate in his san-
grosum and sangaree,) he suggested taking in your publication, which,
he said, would make me laugh, and produce the motion with the odd
name above mentioned.
laughed a good deal at it I must say, but every now and then I came
across some high-flying bit of stuff, which I dare say the fellow who
writes it calls humanity and philanthropy, but which, between you
and me, is humbug and nothing else.
“I dare say if you’d lived in 1833, at the time of the iniquitous eman-
cipation of the black fellows, you'd have been one of the loudest in the
‘man and brother” clap-trap. You don't know the Snow-balls as well
as I do. I’ve seen them under the cart-whip ; and the more's the pity
since the cart-whip was hung up for good and all. I felt it was all up
with the colonies when that happened. I could not sell my estate, but
I leased it to my attorney, and with the paltry share I got of your so-
called compensation, (a downright robbery by the way, if ever there
was one), left Berbice, and settled at Cheltenham, alongside of some old
Guiana cronies, in the same predicament with myself. Sir, we are a
small and far from cheerful part of wronged and ruined men. They're
going to take away the little protection that was left us. Of course I
don't intend to chime in with the abolition nonsense of that old rascal
CLARKSON, about encouraging the slave trade and such like stuff. I
only wish we were where Cuba is, and had been wise enough to keep
our blacks under the collar when we had 'em there. But that's all over,
the more's the pity. I'll tell you the real point where the shoe pinches.
The black fellows won't work. They're a set of the idlest vagabonds !
They’ve no respect for the rights of property and the interests of their
employers. There's a gang of scoundrels about Mount Pleasant—my
estate—rascals that were my slaves, most of them since they were picka-
ninnies fighting for bananas under my dinner-table, up to that fatal
1st of August.
“I’ve clothed those fellows, Sir, I've fed them, I’ve let them culti-
vate provision grounds on my waste, and fatten themselves like pigs
“SIR,
| common slave-field nigger Den I work berry unpleasantly hard,
Well, Sir, I ordered your publication, and
with the cane-juice at boiling times; I've flogged them (that is, my
overseer has) week after week, and done what I could to teach them
industrious habits, by field-work twelve hours a day, six days out of
the seven—for I know what's due to the Church. What's my reward?
Why, now that the fellows are free, as they call it, they haven't the
gratitude to work more than two days in the week. That brings them
in their eight shillings, and they can live the whole seven days through
like fighting-cocks for six. So, their two days’ work done, there they
sit, as lazy as so many gentlemen and as happy as so many kings,
under their verandahs, with their wives by their sides and their pot-
bellied little SAMBos and JULIUS CAESARs tumbling about their feet,
and won't do a stroke of work—not if the Governor was to go on his
knees to 'em. Now, I put it to you, -is this a tolerable state of things?
How would you like to see the labourers in England kicking their heels
in comfort, and putting their thumbs to their noses while tenant and
landlord were begging and praying them to go to work, when once
they’d made enough to keep them for the week 2 What comes of it
all ? The negroes are enjoying themselves, and the planters are
ruined ; four-sixths of the plantations are out of cultivation, and many
of the rascally black fellows are saving money and clubbing it to buy
us out one after another, fellows that you've seen writhing and
squeaking under your dining room windows and your own cart-whips!
They'll have all the property of the colony before ten years are gone.

reconcile it to their consciences I don't know !

We have been favoured with the following outline of the constitution

this month. We must say wedoubt if it will be by any means so good —
I. The tax is to be taken off beer.
II. Every Prussian is to have full liberty to smoke in the street,
or the theatre, or the Senate, or wherever he pleases.
III. The taverns are to be kept open till twelve o'clock.
IV. Government officials are to be allowed to wear moustachios.

the age of fifty.
VI. German students may sing the “Marseillaise,” and “Was ist das
Faterland 2 ”
VII. The duty to be reduced on tobacco.
VIII. Caricatures to be allowed, providing they are kept strictly to
foreign governments, and do not attack the king, or his constitution.
IX. Joking to be permitted indiscriminately, to the fullest extent a
German is capable of.
TX. The censorship on nursery rhymes, books of fashion, bonbon-
mottoes, and pantomimes, to be universally abolished.
XI. Passports to be done away with in cases where a person is going
on a tour of pleasure not exceeding five miles from his place of
residence.
XII. The Police to be reduced 3,000,000.
XIII. Every German to say what he pleases, and to go to bed at
what hour he pleases.
XIV. Free Trade to be allowed henceforth with all parts of the
world, in German sausages, Berlin wool, Presburg biscuits, Prussian
blue, and sauer-krout.
XV. All Prussians to be equal at the table-d'hôte.
&lffitt-bait IBimmer to $it 3itobert Jeel.
IAST week a numerous meeting took place
at Exeter Hall, to consider the expediency
of giving a White-bait Dinner to SIR
Robert PEEL and his late colleagues.
An EMINENT PHILANTHRoPIST was in the
chair.
An ELDERLY GENTLEMAN rose and said,
“Everyone knew SIB Robert had resigned,
and resigned, too, at a period when the
sacrifice was all the greater, for if he had
stopped in power only ashort month longer,
he and the other Ministers would have
made their annual trip to Blackwall, and
have eaten their annual White-bait dinner.
But how stood the question at present 2
SIR. Robert, by going out, like cherries in
the month of June, had taken the white-
bait out of his mouth, and deprived his col-
w leagues of a handsome dinner! Should a
sacrifice like that pass unrewarded ? Should a noble act of heroism,
because it was in a Prime Minister, not elicit their warmest sympathy,
and be rewarded with that usual tribute of an Englishman's admiration
—a dinner ? No, for the dinner voluntarily abandoned, let another din-
ner be given. He, for one, would willingly lay down his guinea, and
he was sure when it was generally known that SIB Robert PEEL had
not allowed a dinner to stand in the way of principle, and had sacrificed
his stomach to his reputation, that all England would cry as with one
voice, “Give me a ticket,” and every white-bait in the Thames would
be too happy to be eaten in such a glorious cause. (Great cheering.)
A. YoUNG GENTLEMAN begged to propose that the subscription be
limited to a penny.
The ELDERLY GENTLEMAN did not mind, but he thought it would be
rather inconvenient if every gentleman who subscribed his penny in-
sisted upon being present.
A voice from under the gallery, suggested that the DUKE of CAM-
BRIDGE be invited to take the chair.
The PHILANTHROPIST thanked the voice for the suggestion, and said
“Of course.”
The resolution was then put from the chair, and carried unanimously.
To show how general was the admiration of the great principle laid
down by SIR Robert and his Ministers, SIR JAMEs GRAHAM has been
included in the invitations.
The dinner is to be left open to all England. A list of Stewards
will be immediately published, and it is expected that Lord BRough AM
and the Ethiopian Serenaders will attend. Tickets may be procured
at the Punch Office.
THE DANCING PAC
Among the last new novelties in dance music are, we are informed
by advertisement, some “IBRAHIM PACHA Quadrilles.” To these,
perhaps, might be set the words following:—
IBRAHIM PACHA had a dance
Out of Egypt into France;
From France to England o'er the main,
And then to Egypt back again.
But what has his Highness to do with quadrilles 2 We have often
heard of dancing dervishes, but never of a dancing PACHA. -
**The new mode.”
THE Daily News tells us that “a new mode,” lately “introduced into
fashionable life, threatens to be subversive to the enjoyment of social
intercourse ;” for there being several tables, as at WEREY's and other
fashionable cookshops,
**—the clever things that come from the mouths of the wits are limited solely to the
table at which they may happen to be placed.”
This is inconvenient, certainly, especially as fashionable wits and
professional jokers, like ToM THUMB and WEIPPERT's quadrille band,
are not yet hired “to attend parties.” We think, however, that if
joke-master ToolE were engaged, he might be the means of securing
the attention of the public for “the clever things from the mouths of
the wits.” For instance, whenever the DUKE of CAMBRIDGE should
find himself uneasy with a repressed good thing, the Crier might then
advertise the fact—“Lords and ladies, pray, attention for the joke of
his Royal HighNess THE DURE of CAMBRIDGE"—“Silence, if you
please, for the bon-mot of Colonel SIBThorp,” and so forth.

62 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. -
I.ON DON OUT OF TOWN.
As the period is now close at hand when the whole of London takes
itself out of town, we may expect the streets to assume the appearance
shown in the annexed picture. It is very probable that the grass will
be shortly growing in the streets, and we have therefore to suggest
that arrangements should be made for taking advantage of the antici-
pated vegetation. We think that sheep might be turned out to graze
| lives within the metropolis.
with advantage to themselves, and perhaps with profit to the rate-payers;
for a charge might be made for pasture, which would go some way
towards the cost of paving on some future occasion. The beadles
might be usefully employed in tending the flocks, and some lace-coated
CorydoN would add to the sylvan beauty of the scene by playing on
“most musical, most melancholy” pipe on the kerb-stone.
The proposed arrangement would have the additional good effect of
supplying something like a glimpse of country life to those whose
pursuits keep them penned up—often by a pen at the desk—all their
The squares, from the probability of their
being completely deserted, as well as from their being possessed of a
few trees, would be the most eligible spot for trying the experiment in
the first instance. Golden Square, from its secluded position, as well
as from the pastoral simplicity of its inhabitants, and the rural predi-
lections of its Beadle, who whiles away his leisure on the garden roller
under the shade of a modest holy-oak, would be perhaps the very best
spot for carrying the project into operation.
THE KENSINGTON RAILWAY.
WE have heard very gratifying accounts of the state and prospects
of this little suburban line, which, in consequence of the fineness of the
weather, has lately experienced a considerable addition to the value of
its stock—of vegetables, which have been for some time the chief
ground of its revenue. A most gratifying report will shortly be laid
before the proprietors, and, from our own peculiar sources, we are
enabled to furnish the following particulars, which may—or may not
—be relied upon :- - -
The shareholders will be informed that the Directors, encouraged by
former results, had determined on laying down a double line—of
lettuces, near the Kensington Station, and had tried the experiment of
filling up the spaces between the sleepers with spring onions, which
has been attended with the happiest consequences. It has also been
agreed to run an extra train of scarlet-runners along the whole line,
from the terminus in the middle of the Scrubs at Wormwood to the
station at Kensington. All this is in addition to the first, second, and
third class potatoes that have been running up for the last four months.
In consequence of this activity on the part of the Directors, a dividend
will shortly be declared of one pound—of potatoes—per share, but the
certificates must be deposited, at least a week in advance, with the
resident gardener—who has superseded the engineer—of the Company.
-- *-
The holders of the preference debentures will be informed that one
lettuce will be in course of payment upon each debenture, on and after
the 1st of September, at the greenhouse of the Company.
The pound of potatoes payable to the shareholders will be free of
income-tax, and the holders of half or quarter shares will receive half
and quarter pounds, but no diseased potatoes will be exchanged
without the payment of the usual transfer-fee to the Company's
solicitor. A dividend with a bad eye may be refused at the time, but
it is expected that the shareholders will use their own eyes when the
potato is tendered. For the accommodation of the shareholders, a
special engine will be placed upon the line, so that the dividend may
be boiled at a trifling per-centage, if desired.
The Directors will no doubt state the gratifying fact, that the police-
man and guard have agreed to take celery for salary, and have
pronounced in favour of this view of the question. Three heads,
therefore, of what they call salary has been voted to them as a bonus,
and a mark of the confidence of the Directors.
With reference to the traffic, the report will not be so encouraging.
A proposition will perhaps be made to try the experiment of special
trains at a shilling an hour, for the conveyance of nursery-maids and
children backwards and forwards from the station at Kensington.
The Directors regret that their hopes of a large income from the
conveyance of Shepherds to the Bush have not been realised. It is
now under consideration whether the Scrubs may not be laid out for
the cultivation of the wormwood that once abounded in the soil, and
estimates are being now made of the probable consumption of worm-
wood in the metropolis, should the Company resolve on taking up that
article as a source of revenue.
The scheme for making the railway available to the laundresses in
the neighbourhood, for washing linen in the boiler and mangling it
under the wheels of the carriages, has at length been abandoned, the
Directors having found that the line is defective as a clothes-line, in
many important particulars.
NEW STYLE FOR ROBINS.
MR. GEoRGE Robins must find himself occasionally very much
puzzled to vary those wonderful productions of the inkstand which
stream in flowing eloquence down the advertising columns of the
newspapers. . The most prolific fountain must be exhausted at last,
and the most active pump will degenerate ultimately into dryness.
We do not say that the inimitable Robins is yet reduced to that state,
but there are occasional symptoms of sameness in his announcements,
which we should be happy to find wearing an air of freshness and
novelty.
Within the last few days we have observed no less than three
different Elysiums “on a small scale” offered to public competition, and
threatened to be knocked down by the RobinsLAN hammer. There
seems to be some danger that the market will be glutted with little
Paradises, and it is to be apprehended that fairy lands of six rooms,
with a fore court and back garden, with omnibuses passing the door
eighty-eight times a day, will become a positive drug, unless something
is speedily done to diminish their number in the catalogues of the
Auction Mart.
| we think for the sake of novelty, it would be as well to try the
effect of advertising the more substantial advantages of the properties
offered for sale, instead of dwelling too much upon their purely ideal
attractions. Instead of saying that the surrounding scenery inspires
the fancy, and suggests poetical associations worthy of the
- PIERIAN SPRING,
it would be much more inviting to purchasers to be able to announce
that there is
A GOOD PUMP ON THE PREMISES.
A realization of Elysium in the
FAIRY-LIKE QUIETUDE -
around would not be half so likely to induce practical, people to come
forward, as a good bold line in the bill, stating that there is
A PUBLIC-HOUSE CLOSE AT HAND ;
or, that the abode of bliss is -
WITHIN FIVE MINUTES’ WALK OF THE BUTCHER.
We earnestly recommend MR. GEORGE Robins to pay attention to our
suggestion for the improvement of his announcements, which otherwise
may possibly sink into a monotony which the public will find un-
bearable. The same genius that has revelled so long in the imaginative
will be quite as much at home in the matter-of-fact, and we look
forward with intense interest to MR. GeoRGE Robins's first attempts
in the suggested new line of composition.

BY ONE OF THEMSELVES.
CHAPTER XXIV.-A LITTLE MORE ABOUT IRISH SNOBS.
| Dublin, he used to wear a red gown and a cocked hat, the splendour
of which delighted him as much as a new curtain-ring in her nose or a
string of glass beads round her neck charms QUEEN QUASHEENEABoo.
He used to pay visits to people in this dress; to appear at meetings,
hundreds of miles off, in the red velvet gown. And to hear the people
crying “Yes, me Lard ' " and “No, me Lard ' " and to read the pro-
digious accounts of his Lordship in the papers : it scemed as if the
people and he liked to be taken in by this twopenny splendour. Two-
penny magnificence, indeed, exists all over Ireland, and may be consi-
dered as the great characteristic of the Snobbishness of that country.
When Mrs. MULHoLLIGAN, the grocer's lady, retires to Kingstown,
she has “MULHoLLIGANVILLE” painted over the gate of her villa ;
and receives you at a door that won't shut, or gazes at you out of a
window that is glazed with an old petticoat.
Be it ever, so shabby and dismal, nobody ever owns to keeping a
shop. A fellow whose stock in trade is a penny roll or a tumbler of
lollipops, calls his cabin the “American Flour Store,” or the “Depo-
sitory for Colonial Produce,” or some such name.
As for Inns, there are none in the country ; Hotels abound, as well
furnished as Mulholliganville ; but again, there are no such people
as landlords and landladies; the landlord is out with the hounds,
and my lady, in the parlour talking with the Captain or playing the
plano.
if a gentleman has a hundred a year to leave to his family they all
become gentlemen, all keep a nag, ride to hounds, and swagger about
in the “Phaynix,” and grow tufts to their chins like so many real
aristocrats.
A friend of mine has taken to be a painter, and lives out of Ireland,
where he is considered to have disgraced the family by choosing such
a profession. His father is a wine-merchant; and his elder brother
an apothecary.
The number of men one meets in London and on the Continent who
have a pretty little property of five-and-twenty hundred a year in
Ireland is prodigious—those who will have nine thousand a year in
land when somebody dies are still more numerous. I myself have met
as many descendants from Irish kings as would form a brigade.
And who has not met the Irishman who apes the Englishman,
and who forgets his country and tries to forget his accent, or to
smother the taste of it, as it were 2 “Come, dine with me, my boy,”
says O'Dowd, of O'Dowdstown, “you'll find us all English there;”

|“I-ah-land,” and her account of her “fawther's esteet?” Very few

iron railroads, (it's a fine Irish economy) and to cut the throats of
the Saxon invaders. These are of the venemous sort ; and had they
been invented in his time, St. PATRick would have banished them out
of the kingdom along with the other dangerous reptiles.
I think it is the Four Masters, or else it's OLAUs MAGNUs, or else
it’s certainly O'NEILL DAUNT, in the Catechism of Irish History, who
relates that when Richard The Second came to Ireland, and the Irish
Chiefs did homage to him, going down on their knees—the poor simple
creatures —and worshiping and wondering before the English king and
the dandies of his Court, my lords the English noblemen mocked and
jeered at their uncouth Irish admirers, mimicked their talk and ges-
tures, pulled their poor old beards, and laughed at the strange fashion
of their garments.
The English Snob rampant always does this to the present day.
There is no Snob in existence, perhaps, that has such an indomitable
belief in himself; that sneers you down all the rest of the world be-
sides ; and has such an insufferable, admirable, stupid contempt for
all people but his own—nay, for all sets but his own. “Gwacious
Gad l’’ what stories about “the Iwish " these young dandies accom-
panying KING Richard must have had to tell, when they returned to
Pall Mall, and smoked their cigars upon the steps of WHITE's
The Irish Snobbishness developes itself not in pride so much as in
servility and mean admirations, and trumpery imitations of their
neighbours. And I wonder DE Tocqueville and DE BEAUMONT, and
the Times' Commissioner did not explain the Snobbishness of Ireland as
contrasted with our own. Ours is that of Richard's Norman Knights,
haughty, brutal, stupid, and perfectly self-confident ;-theirs, of the
poor wondering, kneeling, simple chieftains. They are on their knees
still before English fashion—these simple, wild people : and indeed, it
is hard not to grin at some of their naire exhibitions.
Some years since, when a certain great orator was Lord Mayor of
And what say you to the summit of society—the Castle—with a
sham king, and sham lords-in-waiting, and sham loyalty, and a sham
|HAROUN ALRAschid, to go about in a sham disguise, making-believe
to be affable and splendid? That Castle is the pink and pride of
Snobbishness. A Court Circular is bad enough, with two columns of
print about a little baby that's christened—but think of people liking
a sham Court Circular !
I think the shams of Ireland are more outrageous than those of
any country. A fellow shows you a hill and says, “That's the highest
mountain in all Ireland ;” or a gentleman tells you he is descended
from BRIAN Boroo, and has his five-and-thirty hundred a year; or
MRs. MACMANUs describes her fawther's esteet; or our old DAN rises
and says the Irish women are the loveliest, the Irishmen the bravest, the
Irish land the most fertile in the world : and nobody believes anybody
—the latter doesn't believe his story nor the hearer —but they make-
believe to believe, and solemnly do honour to humbug.
Oh Ireland Oh my country l (for I make little doubt that I am de-
scended from BRIAN BoRoo too) when will you acknowledge that two
and two make four, and call a pikestaff a pikestaff 7—that is the
very best use you can make of the latter. Irish Snobs will dwindle
away then . and we shall never hear tell of Hereditary Bondsmen.
l
P.S. The Snob of England acknowledges the receipt of a commu-
nication signed “I. H.S.” “I. H. S.” is a judicious critic; and a worthy
and kindly Snob.

A VOICE FROM EGYPTLAN HALL.
Owing to the violent hailstorm last Saturday
having broken several of the windows at Egyp-
tian Hall, great fears were entertained that MR.
FABER's speaking-machine might have caught
cold, and have lost its voice. But we are happy
to state that the Automaton runs up the scale as
nimbly as ever, and that his “G” excites the
admiration of the whole room every time he suc-
ceeds in going down to it. To guard against
accidents, however, we should recommend MR.
FABER to have a duplicate machine always in
attendance, on the plan of the Brussels Company,
in which every actor has a “double” ready at
a moment's notice to perform his part, in the
event of his being indisposed to sing.
As this “double” is generally a rising singer,
the indisposition of a prima-donna rarely lasts
longer than a day, in fact a favourite tenor has
been known to recover his voice the moment his
name was taken out of the bills, though he was
so hoarse the minute before that he could not
G | sing a note. It must be mentioned, however,
* to the great credit of the Automaton, that, though
*| he is encored about twelve times a day in “God
save the Queen,” and is indisputably the most
popular singer of the day, not a single apology
has been made for him yet. We hope we are
divulging no secret in stating that he takes a
couple of Stolberg's voice lozenges regularly
every night.
FRAMING A BILL.
The glazier who has mended the 7,000 broken
windows of the Houses of Parliament, has sent
into MR. BARRY his account headed thus—“A
Bill for Panes and Penalties.”
THE PAGANS OF WINSLOW.
WE are not very good geographers ; but we have a strong belief
that Winslow is somewhere in Barbary—in a part of burning Africa ;
famous, according to poets, as the dry-nurse of lions,—arida nutria:
leonum. We know that the uneducated—such is the bigotry of some
forlorn Englishmen—declare that Winslow is in Worcestershire. Well;
we will show our own liberality by respecting the opinions of others.
All we have to repeat is, our conviction that Winslow is a part of some
Pagan state, its laws being administered by Mahometans, or idolaters,
or some hapless creatures dwelling, as in an earth-pit, in moral dark-
ness, in no way lightened by the least glimmering of that divine
Christianity which, according to the Bishop of Norwich, is the pe-
culiar pride of every respectable Englishman. We repeat it; WINslow
is some Pagan place, as the following story—how it crept into the
Worcestershire Chronicle we know not—will indubitably testify :—
“STEALuxg PsAs AT WINslow.—MARY LINEs, aged six years, and SARAH Moss,
aged twelve, appeared in answer to a summons for having picked two handfuls of peas in
a field through which there was a path, and in which they were walking, being the pro-
perty of MR. Robinson. SARAH Robinson, wife of the owner, proved the complaint
against the younger child for the act, and the elder for inciting her thereto. R. P.
Bray appeared for the defence, and subjected the witness to a severe cross-examination,
touching some circumstances which tended to show that the proceedings originated out
of spite to the parents of the children, who are sisters-in-law. The magistrates, having
no alternative, from the positive manner in which the case was pressed by the prosecu-
trix, who laid the damage at 6d., fined the parties 6d. for damage and 13s. costs; and in
default of payment the elder child was committed to gaol for fourteen days.”
The writer—or, rather, translator of the above—has, it is seen, put
it into a very English dress, the better, we presume, to communicate it
to the simple minds of his Arcadian readers; who, learning what pun-
ishment is inflicted upon a child of twelve years old for picking two
handfuls of peas, price 6d., in a pagan country, may clasp their hands
in thankfulness, and with their smock-frocks wipe the grateful dew from
their eyes, blessing their destiny that they are born in refined, philan-
thropic, Christian England. And then, two handfuls of peas, price 6d.
(the translator, of course, means English money). Peas must be very
dear in Pagan land. But we have it. It is well known that the arch-
impostor, MAHOMET, taught a pigeon to peck peas out of his ears, that
he might gull his dupes with the flam that the pigeon, thus pecking,
was bringing him commands from the higher world. (Louis NApoleon
took this hint; and when—primed with Champagne—he landed at
Boulogne to take France, had an eagle all ready to perch upon his
head ; the eagle having long practised upon beef-steaks laid upon
the NAPolecn caput.) Well, there is no doubt that these precious peas
(price 6d.) are peas in a right descent from the Mahomet peas; sacre
peas : and hence their enormous value.
The price of the peas, however, is as nothing to the costs (what are
costs 7) of Pagan land; they amounting to 13s. (for again the translator
calculates in English" money). And the wretched girl, not having
thirteen shillings and sixpence (according to our coin) is taken away-
poor little barbarian —to be shut up in gaol for fourteen long days'
And when in gaol-so foolish are these Mahometans–there is every
cause to believe that a Mufti, paid by the Government, will very
carefully catechise the little offender, and especially command her to
read her Koran. How lucky is it that Winslow is—as we are certain it
is—somewhere in Barbary, and not in Worcestershire.
-
BUTTERFLIES AND BISHOPS.
A week or two ago the papers alarmed us by stating that an
immense cloud of butterflies—a cloud darkening the sun–had been
seen somewhere upon the coast. It was said the farmers were in grea;
trepidation, as the insects threatened to devour everything. Pun
is not superstitious, but he certainly had a dread of some untow
event from this alarming cloud, and his fears have been fully justified
by a Bill introduced into the Commons by MEssRs. FREwBN an
Colquhous—a Bill to make no less than nineteen new bishops'
Within the last week the price of lawn has gone up two shillings a
yard, and wet-nurses have struck for wages, because of the sudden
dearness of black silk aprons.
Going Backwards.
MR. Dish AELI says, “History is nothing but a series of reactions" in
which everything, after a time, retraces its steps. According to this,
MR. Dish AELI will shortly be a Radical again. We should not be suſ"
prised if O'Connell proposes him, next year, for Clonmel.

RELICS AT A DISCOUNT.
UNCH observes with
regret that the
rage for relics has
abated consider-
ably since the
days when the
identical egg-shell
of the identical
egg that NAPO-
LEoN was eating
before the battle
of Austerlitz,
fetched a guinea
and-a-half under
the hammer. We
- have known the
time when the
announcement of
a sale of relics
would have
brought large
capitalists into
competition for
the precious lots.
-- But now we
~ - -
--~~ sº really believe,
--- Rs. that if NApo-
LEoN's best St.
Helena night-cap, or his Fontainbleau slippers, were to appear in a
catalogue, there would be no great sensation excited in the public
mind by such an announcement.
At a sale the other day, Lord GREY's coat was put up and only got
a bidding of seven shillings, which must have been actually less than
it would have produced in Holywell Street. Perhaps, however, as a
lot of Whigs were continually hanging on to his skirts, the coat of
the noble Earl may have been so much worn as to render it nearly
valueless.
If BRough AM's coat had been the lot in question, we should not have
been surprised at the smallness of the offer. As it was once said that
the mantle of ERskINE had fallen on the Ex-Chancellor, we recommend
him to call in an old clothesman when he wants to get rid of it, seeing
that at public auctions a fair price cannot be relied upon.
COPY OF A LETTER FROM THE LORD MAYOR TO THE
CLERK OF THE WEATHER.
“Mansion House, Thursday Evening, July 30th.
“THE LoRD MAYor presents his compliments to the Clerk of the
Weather, and begs to inform him, that, having a private dinner party at
the Mansion House on Saturday next, at six, and being unable, after
repeated applications, to get any ice from the exhausted stores of the
Wenham Lake Company, that, should the Clerk of the Weather have
remaining by him any small pieces calculated for mixing in sherry
cobblers, and could send a supply into London about that time, the
Lord MAYor will feel himself deeply indebted to the Clerk of the
Weather.”
We need not inform the public how promptly this request was com-
plied with. The liberal supply of hailstones that was thrown into
London on the Saturday so warmed the heart of the Lord MAYor,
that he has sent the Clerk of the Weather the freedom of the Glaziers'
Company.
The Pen and the Sword.
The British Lion never wanted to make a meal, not even of a
Yankee cabin-boy; and we hope that the American Eagle is now con-
tent to feed upon native Indian corn, instead of dining upon Britishers,
gloriously dead upon the battle-field. MR. CALHoun, however, very
wisely attributes all this to the tongues of statesmen and the quills of
public writers. “Had there been,” says the American, “the least false
step on the other side—had the speeches in Parliament, or the articles
in the public journals been of an exasperating character, we could not
then have arranged matters on this side as we have done.” And then
he lauds the moderation of PEEL and ABERDEEN. And all this cheer-
ing for the present, is hopeful for the future. A statesman's windpipe,
wisely employed, may in good time shut up in rusty dumbness those—
“mortal engines, whose rude throats
Th’ immortal Jove's dread clamours counterfeit,”
and half-a-dozen quills of half-a-dozen journalists prove too much for
a whole park of artillery. Mortars are devastating instruments—and
yet they may be beaten by inkstands.

love beating beneath my white waistcoat, (for I am proud to say it, I
am not all unknown to that growing power, that kernel of the country,
Young England), it is not without a mixture of horror, and indigna-
tion that I have read the account of what is called the SALoMons
Scholarship. It seems that MR. SALoMons, in gratitude to the infidel
PEEL for throwing open the Mayoralty to Jews—(I only hope that the
gold chain mayn't be missing in a year or two)—has founded a scholar-
ship to bear his Hebraic name ! He-a Jew—gives money to educate a
Christian in the very bosom of Mother Church ; and we, a Christian
people, look on and applaud the act; and SIR RoRERT INGL1s does not
put himself in sackcloth, or shake a cinder-sieve above his head
“But this is not all. The Morning Herald—the last hope of the
truly faithful—eulogizes the act of MR. SALOMoss as “an act of gene-
rosity that recommends itself by its pure patriotism and disinterested-
ness.’ And this is the way that the Herald writes of Jews | I should
as soon have thought to see my blessed grandmother kiss an old
clothesman l
“However, Mr. Punch, I have done my duty. If the SALoMons'
scholar should, after all, not be a Christian, but a Jew in sheep's
clothing—and I confess I have my private doubts upon the matter-if he
should not have placed a lamb, but a viper in the bosom of Mother
Church at the University—if the Chancellor turns a Rabbi—if the feast
of Purim is celebrated on the banks of the Isis, and the Passover held in
the Halls of Oxford, I still, amidst the wreck of all that is dear to every
Englishman, have this consolation—I did not suffer myself to be silent.

PUNCH,
The LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
M I SS R O B | N S O N C R U S O E.
CHAPTER VII.
HILST picking the turkey—which, in
my heart, I wished a golden pheasant,
not so much for its flesh as for its
feathers for a tippet—my thoughts
continued fixed upon my home. I
then felt the bitter fruits of my
obstinacy. I had neglected all the
truly useful arts of life for its vain
accomplishments. I could work a
peacock in worsted ; but, I felt it,
I could not draw a turkey. Again
and again had my dear mother tried
to impress upon my giddy brain
Mrs. Glasse's golden rules “to choose
poultry, game, &c.; ” and as often I
had turned a careless ear from the dear soul, saying, that all such
learning would, of course, be known to my housekeeper; that I would
never marry a man who would expect me to know the age of poultry;
and other impertinence of the like kind. I ought to have known
that “a turkeycock, if young, has a smooth black leg, with a short
spur.” But when I should have laid this wisdom to my heart, it was
beating for spurs not to be found upon turkeys. Then for telling the
age of geese, I despised such homely knowledge. Enough for me,
if I could tell the age of certain beautiful officers, with white feathers
not to be thought of with poultry. How I bewailed the time I had
given to the Parks, bestowing no thought upon the kitchen
Having, with the aid of my tweezers, picked my turkey, I had a
confused suspicion that the bird should be drawn, and stuffed, and
served with gravy. I turned it over and over, looked at it again
and again; and felt humbled by my ignorance. Then I thought of
cooking it as it was, just helping myself to little bits of the breast.
Again I thought, fortune will not send a turkey every day; therefore
no part of it should be wasted. In my perplexity, I at length resolved
to hang it to a tree until the next day, that I might reconsider the
difficulty. I did so ; but I could not silence the self-reproach that
said: “Here you are, Miss Robinson, a finished young lady. You
can play the Battle of Prague—can read very easy French—can work
chain-stitch—can paint tulips on velvet—can dance any country-dance
as though you came into the world with the figure in your head : but
you cannot cook a turkey.” Oh, my dear sisters, may you never feel
the pang of that reproach 1
Assuaging my hunger with some biscuit and the captain's potted
anchovies, I set to work to barricade myself against savages or wild
beasts. With infinite labour I piled trunk upon trunk and bandbox
upon bandbox in a complete circle. Never being accustomed to sleep
in the dark, you may imagine how I missed my rushlight. A woman
always feels protection in a candle; and the lion itself, as I had heard,
was to be awed by a lighted long-six. However, worn out by fatigue,
I soon sank to sleep ; and awoke about the time—so far as I could
judge from the sun–that hot rolls are served in the morning. I made
a hearty breakfast of shell-fish and biscuit—but somehow, I felt a
strange vacuity, an “aching void,” as Doctor Dodd somewhere says,
that I could not account for. I wanted something ; an essential some-
thing. It was the Morning Post. It was always such blessed food—
such support and gladness for the day—to read the “Court Circular ; ”
to be sustained by a knowledge of the royal ridings and walkings ;
and though I knew I should never be invited to such junkettings, still
it imparted a mysterious pleasure to know that “The MARchion Ess
of MAYFAIR had a party, at which all the élite,” &c. It was, somehow
to see the jewels reflected in the type—somehow to catch the odour
of high society even from the printers'-ink. And this, the balm of life,
was denied me. I was so haunted by the thought that, with playful
bitterness, I sometimes wrote with a stick “Morning Post” upon the
sand ; and then wanly smiled and moralised, as the rising tide would
wash that morning print away ! After a season I devoted the time
formerly given to the Post to my parrot ; and found in the eloquent
intelligence of the bird much more than a recompense for my loss.
But let me not anticipate.
I made continual trips to the wreck, and every time returned with
new treasures of food and goods and raiment. What a wardrobe I
OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
had—if anybody could but have seen it Sometimes, when aboard the
ship, I felt a concern for my stores on land, lest they should be ravaged
by men or beasts, but on my return from the ship I found all as I
had left it. Once only I saw two little creatures run from among the
boxes. They were, I thought, either ermine or rabbits. If real
ermine—the notion would rise—what a muff and tippet I might
promise myself l
Whilst loading my raft, an accident occurred that mightily discom-
posed me. The wedding-ring that, for safety, I continued to wear,
became severed in the middle. It was plain there was a flaw in the
virgin gold. Solitude had made me superstitious ; and I looked upon
the broken circle as an omen that I was doomed to perpetual celibacy.
The thought of never-ending singleness fell upon my heart with a
crushing weight. And, to make my misery perfect, the cat that I
have spoken of in a former chapter, again came rubbing herself
against me, looking upwards with horribly speaking eyes, as though
confirming my fear of destitution.
I took the fractured ring from my finger. Hope whispered—“Take
heart, Miss Robinson ; like a first love broken, it may be soldered."
With this, I secured the precious bit of domestic metal, and renewed
my work, a little comforted.
Like a bee gathering sweets, I went from cabin to cabin. Rum-
maging a locker I found three razors ; I was about to leave them,
when my previous train of thought recurred. “The fate that requires
a wedding-ring,” said the thought, “also gives a value to razors.” I
therefore resolved to take the instruments : and the same resolution
induced me to bring away a prodigious stock of tobacco. “I shall
never smoke myself.” I seemed to remark; “but he may.”
In another locker I found some knives and—I could have wept with
gratitude—some silver forks. It having been made one of the first
principles of my education to consider a silver fork essential to any
assertion soever of human dignity, I felt myself lifted by the discovery.
I had learned that what was known as the Iron Age, was no other
than the time of Iron Forks : or why did I take real silver to Black-
heath with me * The age of iron was the age of vulgar toil, when
everybody laboured : now the first-known silver spoon—as I was
instructed by the MissEs WHALEBoNEs—came into the world in the
mouth of the first gentleman.
In another locker I found a bag of sovereigns. They made me sigh.
“Of what use, O sovereigns !” I said, “are you to me? You cannot
buy me a seat at the Opera. You cannot take me to Brighton. You
cannot waſt me to RUNDELL and BRIDGE's, to make choice there."
Flinging down the gold, I said, “O drug, stay there, and "- and then
the thought of the shops in Bond Street, and with the thought the
stock of the four seasons rose in my mind, and I moralised no more,
but took the bag. As I did this, the sky became overcast, and I
found that if I would secure my goods I must shorten my stay. I ran
into a cabin which I recollected had been occupied by a very nice old
gentleman, a clergyman, going out to join his regiment, then fighting
very hard indeed, in India. But, like a dove, he was going out with
the olive in his mouth, to comfort the wounded and preach patience to
the flogged. Taking a hasty glance, I saw nothing but a book upon
the bed-clothes of his cot—the book he had doubtless been reading
when the ship struck; without opening it, I secured my prize, and
ran upon deck. The sky was getting blacker and blacker, and I
resolved to swim for it. The weight of the gold was a little embar:
rassing, but, for the first time, I found that almost any amount of gold
might be borne in difficulties. After a time I seemed to swim the
lighter for it. -
The wind continued to rise, but at length I got ashore, and making
a hasty supper of biscuit and salt-beef, with the smallest imaginable
drop of eau-de-cologne on a lump of sugar, I went comfortably to bed;
for I had in the course of my trips secured a hammock, which I sus-
pended right across my barricade, by tying each end of it to the
handles of opposite trunks. I must confess that for a long time it was
very difficult for me to get into the hammock, as I no sooner got in
on one side than I fell out from the other. However, as I knew there
could be no witness of my awkwardness, I persevered, and in a few
nights not a midshipman in the whole of the royal navy could jump
more adroitly into his sleeping-berth than I did.
DRY ENTERTAINMENT.
THERE was a great deal of speaking at the Lynn demonstration
dinner, but very little to eat. The Protectionists talked, and talked,
as if the farmers would not mind for any other food, as long as they
gave them, plenty of food for laughter.

WHAT RAGGED SCHOOLS MAY COME TO.
It is with peculiar satisfaction that we view the establishment of
Ragged Schools in various parts of the Metropolis. We speak advis-
edly when we describe our satisfaction as peculiar. For it is not
merely that we are rejoiced at the idea of a number of youthful mendi-
cants being prevented from becoming thieves and pickpockets, taught
tº earn an honest livelihood, and rescued from vice and misery, through
the instrumentality of these seminaries. No ; our views are much
higher than such plebeian considerations as these ; and they also
extend far beyond the present time. We have an eye to the benefit of
our posterity, and to that of the superior classes generally. -
When we consider that Eton was established for the reception of
Poºr and indigent scholars, and that Winchester and most of our other
Public schools were, at their first foundation, charities, we may not
Threasonably indulge the hope that the Ragged Schools, originally,
e them, destined for the instruction of the tag-rag-and-bobtail, may
"timately become gratuitous institutions for the education of the
children of the aristocracy.

THE “ MORNING POST" ON CHIVALRY.
THE Post-like STERNE's cook-maid on another domestic event—
never chronicles a marriage in high life that it is not an inch the taller
for it. A recent wedding very much delights our flunkey contempo-
rary, who says :-
“Among the on dits current in fashionable circles relative to the above marriage, is
one which, if true, affords a gratifying proof that even in these days of matter-of-fact and
cold calculation the spirit of gallantry and chivalry, for which their forefather. were
erewhile so celebrated, is not yet extinct among the youthful scions of our nobility.
And then the Post narrates how that Lord MAIDstone, just before
the Derby, offered to LADY CoNsTANCE PAGET his celebrated horse,
Tom Tulloch. : and the lady accepting it, his lordship then offered
himself; and he was accepted too. Proving that, according to the
Post, in the days of chivalry, the heart of a woman was always tested
by horseflesh. Very great, indeed, is the Post on Toxt Tulloch ; had
ToM not been a horse, but another animal, ranked equine by naturalists,
the Post could not have shown more sympathetic interest towards the
quadruped.

THE MEETING BETWEEN THE SULTAN
AND MEHEMET ALI.
(From our own correspondent.)
|oxfor MABLY with previous ar-
rangements, at mid-day pre-
cisely, by the great clock of
Saint Sophia, as the bells of all
the minarets in the city rang a
triple bob-major, and amid the
roaring of the guns on the
Propontis and the Thracian
Chersonese, the Pasha quitted
his steamer, which lay off the
| romantic little village of Trebi-
zond, and entered the great
state barge, rowed by forty-
eight Janissaries, and steered
by the Grand Imaum. All the
ships in the harbour had their
flags half-mast high, in honour
of the auspicious event; the
yards were manned by the
gallant Muftis, and in several
instances the ships were hung with festoons of variegated kibobs;
while, on the respective º of the vessels of war, the bands of the
various regiments were playing the “National Anthem.”
His HighNess THE Viceroy of Egypt was dressed in a simple bul-
bul, with little ornament, save his venerable white beard, and a few
tulips and polyanthuses (sent from the Gardens of the Sweet-waters,
and a present from the SULTANA VALIDE) arranged tastefully in his
cocked hat. A papoosh (or pink diamond) of tremendous brilliancy,
glittered in the hilt of his yatabal. Hoky BEY and Bosh Pasha
attended the Egyptian Sovereign. The eight-and-forty rowers lay to
their oars; and the narghile cut rapidly through the waters of the blue
Bosphorus amidst the shouting of the people from the twenty thousand
caciques that followed in the wake of the gilded barge of state.
The Russian squadron, stationed off Karamania, manned yards as
the vessel passed, and gave a royal salute; and the French and English
ships-of-war saluting similarly, and striking up simultaneously “Rule
Britannia” and the “Marseillaise,” caused a delightful harmony that
was heard all over Stamboul.
The ladies of the Harem lined the walls of the Seraskier's tower, and
waved their shulwars in the air to welcome the illustrious vassal of the
Porte. One of them, lifting up her veil incautiously, to look at the cor-
tège, was seen by the chief of the Eunuchs and instantly sewn into a
sack and flung into the Bosphorus. Her struggles and ludicrous con-
tortions caused a great deal of laughter, and served to &gayer the crowd,
who had been waiting for many hours in order to see the procession.
At the stairs at Seraglio Point the Dromedary Aga was in waiting,
with the two brilliant regiments he commands; and a very large and
double-humped animal, cream-coloured, with his mane and tail tied up
with pink ribbons—the sacred colour, (indeed, this animal is descended
from the Prophet's own camel) was in waiting to receive the renowned
MEHEMET ALI. As soon as he mounted, a catherine-wheel fixed at the
crupper of the animal was lighted, and thus he rode into the great
gate of the Seraglio in a perfect blaze of glory. The roaring and clang-
ing of the gongs of the Etmeidans on guard, the frantic yells of the
Yakmaks,—the howling, in chorus, of the ten million dogs which infest
Stamboul, the jangling of the mosque-bells and the roaring of artillery,
created a festive uproar which may be imagined, but never, never can
be described. A line of dancing Dervishes on either side of the street
performed the most graceful yet most fantastic evolutions as the
magnificent procession passed; and the Armenian Patriarch perform-
ing on an acolyte, and the Greek Episkopotatos (the venerable SPIRI-
Dion PAPAPokidikes) beating ol. a drum, headed their respective sects,
and vied with each other in demonstrations of loyalty.
The Synagogues were one and all illuminated, and the Chief Rabbi
stood at the porch, dressed in yellow, and blowing on a ram's horn.
The DIPLoMATIC Body appeared in full uniform, the Chief Secre-
tary of each legation bearing a superb banner, with the national arms,
such as the British Lion, the Cock of France, that interesting and ex-
tremely rare bird, the double-headed Eagle of Austria, the Ducks of
Russia, &c. The American Minister flung about showers of Illinois
and Pennsylvanian Bonds; which, however, were received with utter
disregard by the Turks—for the most part unable to read, and ignorant
of their value.
The CoRREspondents of THE London PREss appeared in their very
best Sunday attire, several of them sporting new fronts for that
auspicious day. A terrific row took place between the Correspondent
of the Chronicle and the gentleman who represents the Daily News, in a
scramble for twenty kopek pieces, which the Pasha's dragoman was

flinging out of his saddle-bags among the crowd; but this unseemly
squabble was put a stop to by SIR STRATFoRD CANNING, who ordered
the worthy fellows a pot of porter at the “Timour the Tartar” public-
house—the canteen for the troops close by the Seraglio gate.
Within that famous edifice His Highness the SULTAN ABDUL
MADJID was in waiting to receive his mighty vassal. The Grand
Vizier came out to hold MEHEMET ALI's foot as he dismounted from
his dromedary; but the Pasha slipping as he descended, the illustrious
pair rolled over and over, to the no small amusement of His Highness,
who was seated on his peacock's throne, dressed in the blazing salama-
lek and pilaff, which he wears on state occasions.
As soon as IBRAHIM had got off the dromedary, it was carried off to
be cut up and roasted for the day's banquet; this is invariably the
custom when any man has crossed a camel of the breed of the Prophet.
Its meat is delicious. Its hump is pronounced by epicures to be of
the richest flavour; its tail resembles the favourite ox-tail so much
used in the soups of the English aristocracy.
The Pasha, advancing backwards, according to etiquette, towards
the royal divan, was affectionately received by his youthful Sovereign,
who gave him a place by his side. Pipes were instantly brought,
both Dutch and Turkish.
“Bring coffee—black coffee,” said His Highness the Sultan to the
Cafidge Bashi.
“BLAck Corfeel" cried MEHEMET, looking wildly round ; “it—it
don't agree with me.”
A ghastly smile played upon the lips of the Sultan, as with a.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE NEW OMNIBUS.
In consequence of the repeated stoppages of the public thoroughfares,
it is found to be a thorough loss of time in nine cases out of ten to enter
an omnibus. As the fatigue of walking may, however, be considerable,
a vehicle is in the course of construction by which passengers will be
able to retire to separate apartments at the top of the 'bus, where the
operations of shaving, hair-cutting, &c. &c. may be carried on, so that
no time will be lost even during an entire obstruction of the thorough-
fare. The only difficulty that might have arisen, was caused by a con.
sideration of the propriety of erecting public vehicles to the elevation
of two or three stories; but the advertising-vanshaving carried puffing
to a tremendous height, it can no longer be a question whether the
public may not have the advantage as well as the inconvenience of the
principle. -
It is proposed to lather the company during the progress of the 'bus,
and apply the razor during the dead stand-stills. There will also be
a compartment for letter-writing—as at the clubs—and the parties who
avail themselves of the accommodation will adapt their penmanship
to the speed—of course practising a running hand when the 'bus is
going at a tolerable pace, and resorting to the old jog-trot style when
the vehicle is making its way over fragments of broken pavement.
There will be a refreshment-room in connection with the boot, and a
circulating library near the top, so that a passenger on entering may
subscribe either for the whole or a portion of his journey.
The Benefit of an Example.
A Few days ago Justice Cole, at Bodmin, thus addressed an un-
happy girl, who, under frightful circumstances, had been indicted for
infanticide, but was acquitted of the charge, and found guilty of the
concealment only. The Judge said, “Not to add reproach to you, but
to hold you up as an example to others, I feel bound to pass upon you
a severe sentence.” And the sentence was two years' imprisonment.
Now, in the name of justice, if the girl, for the crime committed by
herself, did not deserve so severe a visitation, why, we ask it, should
she suffer as an “example” to others? To suffer for a crime com-
mitted is justice; but to suffer only that others may be deterred from
evil, is to be a martyr, and not a culprit.

£ntinents of the late $torm in the ſūetropolis.
“It is an ill wind that blows nobodygood,” and the storm must be very
pitiless indeed which does not shower down advantages on somebody.
In the first place, the tremendous rain of Saturday week came to the
aid of the Lord MAYon, who had been calling in vain upon the water
companies to open their hearts and their sluices. The Clerk of the
Weather acted the part of turncock on this occasion, and flooded the
- metropolis with some millions of gallons of that element which
“cheers” (those who like it) “but not inebriates.” The common
sewer was never in such a swellish state before, and the face of nature
—in the metropolis—got such a washing as it does not often experience.
It is not generally known that a Cabinet Council which happened to
be sitting during the storm had a refresher thrown upon their usually
dry, proceedings, by the sudden entrance of a cataract through the
roof and windows. The business of Government was carried on for
several minutes under a tremendous gig umbrella, lent by the house-
keeper to the Ministers until the tempest was over.
The effect of the storm on the newspapers was tremendous, and
we understand the spirited proprietor of the Morning Heraid in-
tends engaging MR. BRADwell, to get up a storm occasionally, of
which that paper is to have the exclusive benefit. The hurricane
will commence at Shoe Lane and terminate on the west side of Far-
ringdon. Market. Three columns of the electric fluid will appear as
leaders in the paper of the next day, and two “own reporters” will be
carried away in a whirlwind, of which they will take ample notes, with
a view to publication.
ANOTHER STOPPAGE.
FLEET STREET is stopped again, making somewhere about the twen-
tieth this year. Considering the street is oftener stopped than used,
we think the thoroughfare had better be blocked up altogether, and
then persons in a hurry would know at once they had better run round
by Holborn when they wanted to go from the Strand to Ludgate Hill.
We advise the Lord MAYor therefore to put up the following notice:–
“Considering Fleet Street is a constant source of annoyance, and has
been found to be terribly in the way of persons having to transact
business in the City, it will be closed to all public traffic on and after
August the 10th, and will be laid out for the future exclusively as a
Cab-walk and practising-ground for advertising-vans. Sealed tenders
from advertisers and cab proprietors, stating highest terms for the
lease of the entire street for one year, to be sent into Guildhall.
“By order of the
“Lord MAYor.”
WEunderstand that the two senior captains
of the Iron Boats have agreed to take
the retirement lately offered. The mate
of the Cricket was reported to have sold
out; but on inquiry it proved that he
had only sold out his stock of ginger-
beer on one of those “hot Saturdays.”
which have recently been got up on the
river, in imitation of the “long Thurs-
days” at the Opera.
It is whispered, in circles very likely
to be misinformed, that the penny steam-
boats intend issuing daytickets at afare
and a half, which will be available for
two hours from their date; and season
tickets, which may be used for a whole
week, will be sold for threepence.
The spirited Directors of the Ant have
prepared a Report, from which it appears
that, after declaring a dividend, there
will be three hundred-weight of small
coal to add to “the rest” in the cellars
of the Company. -
The crew of the Daisy have been laid up with the hooping-cough,
and the boy who is cutting his teeth has been a severe sufferer. .The
captain's feet were in gruel when our reporter left, and the skipper
was trying to get down a quantity of oatmeal and vinegar, which had
been recommended to him as an “emulgent.” The squadron of evolu-
tion off Hungerford continues to perform the most difficult ins and
outs with perfect safety.

those who, from their position, ought to excite within us the liveliest
expectations of human perfectibility. We have just laid down the

pressing to those who look upon JAck KETCH as a practical censor
ºnorum :-
“Early on Sunday morning, Policeman BRAY, while on duty at the Heath, fell in
with SARAH TAylor, wife of ‘JAck KETch," and perceiving she was encumbered with
a basket and bundle, examined them, and found that one contained potatoes, and the
other beans. As she gave evasive answers, he took her into custody, when she confessed
she had rooted them from a field belonging to MR. C. Roberts, and that three others
had been with her.”
It is not often that we feel disposed to despair of human improve-
ment : but we look upon the condition of SARAH TAYLOR as hopeless.
We very naturally, very justly require of those fortunate individuals
who in their childhood have received the benefits of careful moral
training, conduct more exemplary, more useful to society and honour-
able to themselves than we can conscientiously demand of the poor
human waifs and strays of this unequal world. In the like manner,
we think we have a right to expect from the spouse of the hangman
conduct more guarded, habits much more respectable, than from other
women less happily wedded. We should say of MRs. JACK KETCH as
of MRs. CEs.AR: “She must not be suspected.” And for this reason—
the partner of her heart, and bed and board, being the public teacher
of great moral lessons—the solemn schoolmaster of the halter—she
ought, by the extreme punctiliousness of her conduct, to show to the
world the elevating benefits of a close companionship with such a
national moralist.
“You may break, you may ruin the vase if you will,
But the scent of the roses will hang round it still,”
sings MR. MooRE, and after him ten million young ladies. In the like
manner, no evil fortune, no one kind of ruin in its many varieties,
should fall upon the wife of JAck KETCH, to the destruction, the entire
passing away of that moral scent of roses with which the hangman, as
her partner, and, insensibly, her daily teacher, must have endowed her.
The hangman should be typified as the husband of the blind woman,

“MR. PUNCH,
“Let me call your attention to the following paragraph,
which appeared the other day in the Daily News —

THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
M | S S R O B J N S O N C R U S O E.
CHAPTER VIII.
HILST making my breakfast, I began to
think—it was the constant custom of
my dear father—of my dinner. My
thoughts immediately flew to the
turkey; and again I felt confounded
by my ignorance. How was I to dress
it 2 Whilst in this state of perturba-
tion, and inwardly reproaching myself
for the time I had lost at tambour-
work that might have been so usefully,
so nobly employed in at least the
theory of the kitchen, my eye fell upon
the book I had brought from the wreck;
the book lying in the cot of the regi-
mental chaplain going out to India.
Listlessly enough, I took the volume
in my hand—opened it, and, equally
to my astonishment and joy, read
upon the title-page—The Complete Art
of Cookery 1 My gratitude was un-
bounded, and I blessed the good man
whose midnight studies had indirectly
proved of such advantage to me.
With beating heart, I turned over the pages, until I came to “Turkey.”
Again and again I read the directions ; but though they were written with all
the clearness of a novel, they only gave me, what I once heard called, a mag-
nificent theory. I felt that drawing required a practical hand ; for how was
I to know gall from liver ? “A stuffing of sausage-meat” sounded very well
—but how to make it 2 And then—though, possibly, the plant might grow
in the island—where to get a shred shalot The excellent chaplain's book,
instead of instructing and comforting me, plunged me in the profoundest
melancholy. As I turned over the pages—I, a desolate spinster on a desolate
island—I seemed scoffed and mocked at by the dishes that I read of—dishes,
all of them associated with the very best society, and many of them awaken-
ing thoughts of Michaelmas goose, of Christmas beef, of spring lamb, and all
the many amenities that impart the sweetest charm to civilised existence.
With a strong effort of will, I laid down the book: I would keep it, I thought,
for calmer hours. When more accustomed to my hideous solitude, it might
soothe and support me, throwing the fascinations of romance about a cold
and hungry reality.
Walking upon the beach, I looked, as usual, in the direction of the wreck,
and found it—gone. The gale of the night had doubtless been very violent—
though I slept too soundly to hear it—and the remains of the miserable vessel
had sunk for ever in the deep. I was, at first, very much affected; but when
I remembered that with the exception of one box, containing a bonnet of the
most odious colour for my complexion, I had brought all my dear sister-passen-
gers' trunks and boxes safe ashore, I felt soothed with the consciousness that,
at least I had done my duty.
And I was upon an island—alone ; with neither man, nor—excepting the
aforesaid rabbits (or ermine)—beast. After a flood of tears, I resolved, like
a true woman, to make the best of my misery. I walked fur- |
ther into the island, and discovered a beautiful bit of grass- t
plot, backed by a high rock. To this place, with a strength
and patience I am almost ashamed to confess, I removed
every trunk and every box, placing them in a semicircle,
with the rock as—I believe it's called—the gable end.
When this was done, I cut down innumerable stakes of wil-
low : this I was enabled to do with the surgeon's saw, a
remarkably neat and elegant little instrument. The stakes
I drove into the earth, within about six inches round the
trunks, by means of a cannon-ball—providentially, as it after-
wards turned out, brought from the wreck. This being
done—and it cost me incredible labour to accomplish it—I dug ||
up hundreds of creepers, and parasitical plants, and cactuses,
that I found in different parts of the island, and replanted |
them near the willow-stakes. Vegetation was very rapid
indeed, in that island. In less than a week the plants and
willows began to shoot, and—to anticipate my story a little
—in two months every trunk and every box was hidden by
a green and flowering wall. The cactuses took very kindly,
and formed a hedge, strong enough, I verily believe, to
repel a wild beast or a wild Indian. I ought to have said
that I had taken the precaution to roof my bower, as I called
it, with some tarpaulin, that stained and made my hands
smell horribly. However, I had no remedy.
Whilst I worked at my bower, I lived upon the biscuit and
potted meats and preserves found in the steward's cabin. In
time, however, I began to grow tired of these, and longed for
something fresh. As for the turkey, I had left that hanging
to the tree, being incapable of drawing and dressing it.
Many wild-fowl flew about me, but, disheartened by the
turkey, I took no heed of them. At length it struck me that
though not much of a cook I might be able to boil some shrimps.
The first difficulty, however, was to catch them. During my
visits to English watering-places I had observed females of
the lower orders, with hand-nets I think they call them, fish-
ing for shrimps. I therefore resolved to make a net. Here,
at least, some part of the education acquired at the MissEs
WHALEBONE's was of service to me, for I knew how to knit.
Amongst the stores I had brought from my ship, were several
balls of twine. Chopping and chiselling a needle, I set to
work, and in less than three days produced an excellent net.
This I stretched on a stout elastic frame of wood, and the
tide serving, walked—just like one of the vulgar women I
had seen at Brighton and Margate—bare-legged, into the
sea. The shrimps came in little shoals, and in less than a
couple of hours I am sure, I returned to the shore with not
less than three quarts of the best brown shrimps, Gravesend
measure. These I boiled ; obtaining a light after this
fashion :
When a very little girl, I had always assisted my brother
when making fireworks for Guy Fawkes. It was he who
taught me how to make—I think they are called, little devils.
A pinch or two of gunpowder is taken in the palm of the
hand, and wetted : it is then kneaded into the form of a
little cone ; a few grains of dry powder are laid upon the top,
when fire is applied to it, and the whole thing goes off in a
red eruption, like a toy Vesuvius. Having prepared the
powder, I struck sparks upon it ; using my steel busk
(how the sparks did fly about it, to be sure 1) and a flint.
|By these means I burnt a piece of linen—a beautiful bit of
new Irish, and so got my original stock of tinder. After
this, I had only to use my busk and the flint to obtain a
light—for I found a heap of matches in the purser's locker–
when I wanted it. Gathering dry sticks and leaves into a
heap, I made a rousing fire. I had brought away the ship's
compass ; and so used the metal basin that contained it as
a saucepan. In this I boiled my first shrimps. I had no salt,
which was a great privation. Necessity, however, the mother
of invention—(and, certainly, for a little outcast, he has
proved a very fine child in the world ; though when prospe-
rous, I'm afraid he very seldom thinks of his mamma)—ne-
cessity suggested to me, that if I would pound the gunpowder
very fine, it might at a pinch serve for salt. I tried the
experiment ; and though I must allow that salt is better
without charcoal, nevertheless, salt with charcoal is infinitely
better than no salt at all.

turned to ; and with a few paper lanterns, and a real native at the
human mind is given to variety—a fact that in my solitude I have fre-
quently pondered on—and I began to long for some other kind of food;
in fact, for some fresh fish. In my wanderings about the island, I had
discovered a beautiful piece of water—clear as crystal, and sweet as
milk—in which were multitudes of the most beautiful roach, and
gudgeon, and pike, and I know not what. I felt very much disposed
to obtain some ; but my wishes met with a check from these thoughts.
“In the first place,” I said, “I have no tackle ; in the next, I am no
fisherwoman.” Now to have made my argument complete against
angling, there should have been no fish. But it was not so. I therefore
determined to invent me some tackle.
My petticoat—my crinoline—I had no doubt there were fifty others
in the boxes—flashed upon me. It was a little worm, and the others
were, no doubt, new ; besides, I had more than one of my own stock.
Knowing that fishing-lines were made of hair, I immediately began to
draw my crinoline. As I drew out horse-hair by horse-hair I moralized
—I could not help it—upon the wondrous accidents of life. “When,”
thought I, “for the Crown-and-Anchor Ball, I first put on this
crinoline, swimming into the room in a cloud of white satin—did
I then think it (the petticoat) was ever intended to catch little
gudgeons ?” And with these thoughts, I patiently, mournfully, drew
out hair by hair, and found that they would bear any weight of fish
that might jump at the hook.
The hook! Where was the hook? In another instant a thought
suggested the ring—the broken wedding-ring. There was a some-
thing in the notion that brought to my face a melancholy smile. There
was a bitterness, a pleasant bitterness, in the idea, that I relished
mightily. I therefore resolved to turn the ring into a rude hook,
which, by means of a pair of pliers from the surgeon's case, I accom-
plished. And it looked so remarkably like a hook, nobody could have
imagined it had ever been a wedding-ring.
A tall, tapering rod grew on every tree. I therefore set out to the
brook fully equipped. Arrived at the place, I baited the ring—the
hook I should say—with nothing more than a little chewed biscuit,
mixed, to keep it together, with pomatum. I threw in, and as fast as
I threw in, I had a bite. It was curious to see the innocent creatures
fly to the ring ; that is, the hook that was to destroy them. I was for
some time astonished at their simplicity. At length I thought, “Poor
things their eagerness to bite at the wedding-ring proves the island
to have been always uninhabited. They bite in this way, because
they have never before beheld the face of a woman . "
THE CABS AND THE STOPPAGES.
THE cab-drivers of the Metropolis are perhaps the only parties
benefited by the obstruction of the various metropolitan thoroughfares.
The blocking up has the most extraordinary effect upon the cab-fares,
for which a new seale ought to be immediately framed, in order to
meet the circumstances of the numerous blockades now abounding in
London. It is absurd to say that it is a shilling fare from St. Clement's
Church to Cheapside, when the shortest communication now open
between these two places is at least five miles in longitude.
The proprietors of the numerous Guides to Cab-fares are surely
entitled to compensation from somebody or other, on account of these
publications being rendered utterly valueless. The traveller who
jumps into a HAnson, expecting to be whirled from the foot of
Farringdon Street to Temple Bar for eightpence, will be astonished at
a demand being made upon him for two-and-eightpence, after dragging
him through a quantity of by-streets, and landing him at the end of
Chancery Lane, with a digital direction and an announcement that
“That’s Temple, Bar over on t'other side of them paving-stones.”
The cab-fares will be treble everywhere for taking you nowhere, and
jolting you about through all sorts of out-of-the-way places without
ever bringing you to the end of your journey.
We really begin to suspect that the cab proprietors have a hand in
the blockading nuisance; that they are in league with the New River;
are hand in hand with the gas; or at the bottom of the sewers; where
º they are really the instigators of the nuisance—they well deserve
to be.
Rubbish for sale.
As there is a doubt about a purchaser coming forward to bid for the
Pavilion at Brighton, we suggest that it be bought up for the Chinese
Collection, unless “Number One, St. Paul's,” should purchase it for

PROTECTION DINNERS.
WHEN children have a tumble or roll down stairs, folks give them
fruit or sweet-stuff to stop their crying. The Protectionists having
sustained a thumping tumble, are comforted with dinners, MASTER
BENTINCR has been treated at Lynn, and MASTER MARQUIs GRANBy has
also been consoled at Walsam. His father, the DUKE of RUTLAND, shone
very brilliantly on the occasion. Pity it is that so many coronets
have spoilt so many wits The Duke opposed the Free-trade prin-
ciple ; and his opposition was strengthened by the following tremendous
illustration.
(Several farmers were carried out in fits of laughter,
and were not fully recovered until well pumped upon.) The Duke
id:
“He had heard of a gentleman, who having two chances, tossed up with his friend,
agreeing, if the sovereign came head, he was to win, but if tail he was to lose. It was
not long before the gentleman had the tail, and he feared we should soon be very much
in the same situation [Hear, hear, and applause].”
Now, if his Grace will—for one minute—lend us the illustration, we
will venture to observe, that once when fate tossed for a Duke for the
house of MANNERs, certainly “a head” did not get it.
MR. DisrAELI, who “attends” all Protection dinners at the shortest
notice, made at Walsam a dreadful onslaught on Manchester; the
same Manchester, that only two little years ago invited him to preside
on a festal occasion, when he said “all things that are pretty and
sweet” to the unsuspecting and admiring cotton-pods. And at Walsam,
very magnificently did he pooh pooh poor Manchester, asking where
it was when Englishmen won Magna Charta ? This is unkind. We
have a great admiration for the author of “Coningsby,” and, therefore,
in our own meek way, we should reprimand either CoboFN, BRIGHT,
WILson, or any other Manchester man who, seeking to depreciate the
parent of “Coningsby,” should ask—“Where, when the Israelites

CRIME AND IGNORANCE.
John SMITH, aged 21 ; WILLIAM SMITH, 19 ; THoMAs BURRows, 18;
and GEoRGE LEEs, 18, were a few days since tried at Appleby, for
a most heinous offence. A poor girl was the outraged victim of their
combined brutality. The culprits—who would have been hanged
under the old law—were sentenced by MR. Justice CREsweLL to
transportation for life. He said in his address :—
“They were all still very young, and yet apparently, from their previous conduct, and
their present demeanor in the dock, so hardened and devoid of shame, that it could
scarcely be expected that punishment with them would operate in any other way than as
an example for others. They had been well employed here, working like free men in a
free country, for masters of their own choosing, and well paid for their labour. But his
Lordship would tell them, that they would now have to go where there would be no free-
dom, and no such wages—where there would be labour, indeed, as that of a slave, but
without any pay-day, and where a holiday would never come round.”
Why, this is true—terribly true : and the benighted condition of
these men—the hideous state of moral darkness that renders them,
like the brute, the mere creatures of the lowest animal instinct—is to
be answered for, surely not alone by the culprits, but by a Govern-
by the State that suffers thousands and tens of thousands to grow
up, with no more self-respect taught them than is taught their
contemporary cattle. A hideous, shocking spectacle is it to contem-
plate the condition of these wretched men—as yet upon the threshold
of manhood—doomed to a life-long slavery, in which “a holiday never
comes round.” Nevertheless, disgust of the culprits must not make us
forgetful of the terrible truth that, had the State fulfilled its first duty
to them, they might not have so grievously failed in their duties
to a fellow-creature. They were brought up as brutes, and society
reaps the terrible fruit of their rearing.
A CARD.
MR. BENJAMIN DISRAELI begs leave to inform the Nobility, Gentry,
and Ultra-Conservative public in general, that he attends Protectionist
Parties, and has a large collection of speeches of every description
always ready, together with a set of sarcasms, which he undertakes
shall be carefully delivered either in Town or Country.
B. D'I. feels justified in assuming to himself the title of the
ONLY POLITICAL IMPROVISA-TORY:
for having during several years given his attention to the impromptu
line, he has on hand a very large assortment of retorts and replies,
suited to every occasion. Though he keeps a large quantity ready
made, they are warmed up so rapidly after a process peculiar to the
advertiser, that he feels justified in announcing them as absolute
novelties.
B. D'I. has no objection to enter into a contract to supply Protec-
tionist oratory by the single dinner, or he will go out to evening
meetings at a great reduction on an arrangement being made for the
entire session. Ministers worried by the day, night, week, month, or
year, and Protectionist Peers waited upon at their own houses.
The following Testimonials are humbly submitted to the Public :-

Ilot onerous. G. BENTINck.”

THE illness among the Brussels Company has been so general, that

understand that the Brussels sprouts have felt the influence of the
epidemic.
ment that assumes to itself the title of maternal—(for is not the
QUEEN, by the gentle fiction of the law, the Mother of her People 2)—
HEATHER NEAR HOME.
N endeavour was
made, Some
time ago, at
the inclosure
of Hampstead
Heath; but it
was deservedly
scouted as an
attempt at
private ag-
grandisement,
to the injury
of the public.
A proposal,
however, for
inclosing this
piece of waste
land has been
made to us on
entirely new
grounds ; and
we think these
so very plau-
sible, that
though we
cannot give the
scheme our entire countenance, neither can we exactly turn up our
nose at it.
A short time since, in the House of Peers, Lord Brough AM com-
plained bitterly of an epidemic which prevails at this time of the year
in the Houses of Parliament, where it commits formidable ravages ;
and if it does not swell the bills of mortality, occasions a frightful mor-
tality of bills. His Lordship termed it the Legislative Cholera, and
described it as a disorder of parliamentary proceedings. In our own
nosology, it ranks as the Grouse Fever, its chief symptom being a vio-
lent delirium, consisting in an inordinate craving for sport, and produc-
ing a dangerous determination of Members to the Moors. It is to
check this rush of senatorial blood to the country, and restore its circu-
lation at head-quarters, that the project for inclosing Hampstead
Heath is put forward. It is not unreasonably contended, that heather
is heather; that grouse are as likely to thrive on the heather of Hamp-
stead as on any other; and that it would be possible to have as good
shooting on the metropolitan as on the Scotch Highlands.
Accordingly, it is suggested that the Heath of Hampstead should be
fenced in, and converted into a preserve, plentifully stocked with grouse
of all descriptions. For this purpose all the houses are to be pulled
down, except JACK STRAw's Castle, which is to be converted into a
castle of the baronial order. It is in contemplation to change the Wale
of Health into the Vale of Ptarmigans; to promote the ponds into lochs,
and to christen the Hill of Primrose by the name of Ben. These altera-
tions effected, it is believed that the sportsman will not have to travel
farther north than the “Spaniards” in quest of game ; so that Mem-
bers will be enabled to enjoy a day's shooting, and devote their evenings
to the service of their country. A strong opposition to the proposed
measure is anticipated from the donkey proprietors; but there is no
doubt that, should it be carried into execution, there will be a greater
abundance of donkeys on Hampstead Heath than ever.
THE WINCHILSEA ECHO.
A LETTER, which has appeared in most of the morning newspapers,
has been addressed to the Electors of Great Britain by LoRD
WINCHILSEA. Of this epistle, the following extraordinary piece of
writing forms the commencement:—
“FEllow-CountryMEN,-The warm and enthusiastic reception which you gave to
the appeal which I presumed to make to you in 1828, when the voice of Protestant
England sounded through every valley, and each surrounding hill re-echoed the cry of
“No surrender of those religious principles upon which our civil and religious liberties
had been based '"—
Thus much of the noble lord's letter we have quoted, to call
attention to the very remarkable echo which his Lordship has
discovered among the hills of England. We, were aware of
the existence of a similar natural curiosity in the sister island,
but we had no idea that among our native hills there was an echo
so long-winded as this. Till now we had a very inadequate conception
scarcely on any one night has it been possible to give the performances of the strength of lungs possessed by Protestant England, which we
advertised. There has evidently been something in the air unfavour- take to be an alias of the Bfitish Lion.
That noble beast must have
“aggravated his roar” tremendously to have awakened an echo-and
such an echo-throughout all the hills in the country, from Skiddaw to
Shooter's, and from the Peak to Primrose.

ONE of the great objections to placing the WELLINGTON Statue over
the entrance to the Green Park is, that it will give a sort of pig-with-
one-earish appearance to the western approach to the British Metro-
polis. It has therefore been proposed to obviate this difficulty by
erecting a statue of Punch on the opposite gate which leads to Hyde
Park; and thus uniformity will be gained without elegance being
sacrificed. -
We do not mean to say that we have done more than the Hero of
Waterloo, to deserve a statue ; but, considering that we are the hero
|ºf at least a million victories over humbug of every description, we
think we are entitled to a statue almost as large as that assigned to
| the DUKE of WELLINGto.N. - -
As our proposed pedestal is so situated, that our statue will require
supporters, we beg leave to put in a word for those old-established
favourites of the public, the British Lion and Unicorn. As
British Lion is expected to be out of work for the next twelvemonth
at least, we cannot find him a better post than the one to which our
artist has promoted him.
THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION.
ECENTLY this Association has
been grubbing about in
the neighbourhood of
York, with considerable
earnestness of purpose.
Various papers have
been read, but the most
interesting papers ap-
peared to be the morning
papers ; which were pe-
rused with eagerness by
those who had been list-
ening to the dry details
of Archaeology.
MR. ALBERTWAY, who
seems to have a peculiar
way of his own, read a
long, prosy affair, about
the “alleged discovery
of the tomb of Constan-
TIUS CHLoRUs, and the
ignited lamp found there-
in.” We should be glad
to know what materials
were used for lighting the
lamp, which has been found still ignited after the lapse of several cen-
turies. LASIUs—a corruption, no doubt, of Lazy-ass—tells us that “the
ancients had the art of dissolving gold into a fat liquor which would
continue burning for ages.” We don’t believe the ancients, even if they
knew. the way, would have been such precious fools as to turn their
cash into kitchen-stuff. They might have reversed the operation, and
got the best price for their dripping ; but they never would have
melted their substance by liquidating their precious metals in the style
alleged by LASIUs. -
MR. WELLBELovED thinks the story of the lamp a hoax, because
there is no foundation for it in fact, but he is quite prepared to swallow
the “fat liquor" made from gold, which he declares to be perfectly
practicable.
| MR. Newton has been reading a paper on what he calls Roman
Yorkshire. We are preparing a companion to it, under the title of
“Grecian Kensington.” There is no doubt in our minds that Phili-
more Place is of Greek extraction, as the syllable, Phil, clearly indi-
Cates.
MR. Brown E, the historian—by the bye, what history has BRowNE
written ?—has discovered a crack in the centre tower of York Minster,
and as anything cracked is the delight of the savans, they are all
cock-a-whoop about the mysterious fissure. The DEAN of HEREFORP
was ready to take his oath to the existence of a crack, and somebody
asked, with reference to the “crack of doom,” whether there was any
crack in the dome of St. Paul's Cathedral. We recommend the
Archaeologists to look to their own upper stories before they complain
of the cracked condition of those of their neighbours. -
PROFEssoR PHILLIPs seems to have come out most impressively with
an observation of wondrous profundity. He “wished to remind gentle:
men present that 6000 gallons of water weighed twenty tons.” If we
had been there we should certainly have followed up this marvellous
piece of truth by reminding gentlemen present that “2 pints make
i quart, and 4 quarts 1 gallon.” PROFEssoR PHILLIPs is the Cockrº
of the nineteenth century.
Professor WILLIs declared our Cathedrals were all cracked ; but
he thinks the wounds may be repaired by the application of plaste.
If this is really a remedy, we recommend the Archæologists to dip their
heads every morning in a pail of compo. We have no doubt the effect
would be as refreshing as the operation would prove salubrious.

THE SNOBS OF ENGLAND.
BY ONE OF THEMSELVE8.
CHAPTER XXV.-PARTY-GIVING SNOBS.
OUR selection of Snobs for the past few weeks has been too exclu-
sively of a political character. “Give us private Snobs,” cry the
dear ladies. (I have before me the letter of one fair correspondent at
the fishing village of Brighthelmstone in Sussex; and could her com-
mands ever be disobeyed 2) “Tell us more, dear MR. SNoB, about
your experience of Snobs in society.” Heaven bless the dear souls —
they are accustomed to the word now—the odious, vulgar, horrid, un-
pronounceable word slips out of their lips with the prettiest glibness
possible. I should not wonder if it were used at Court amongst the
Maids of Honour. In the very best society I know it is. And why
not ? Snobbishness is vulgar—the mere words are not . that which
we call a Snob, by any other name would still be Snobbish.
Well, then. As the season is drawing to a close ; as many hun-
dreds of kind souls, snobbish or otherwise, have quitted London ; as
many hospitable carpets are taken up; and window-blinds are piti-
lessly papered with the Morning Herald; and mansions once inhabited
by cheerful owners are now consigned to the care of the housekeeper's
dreary locum tenens—some mouldy old woman, who, in reply to the
hopeless clanging of the bell, peers at you for a moment from the area,
and then slowly unbolting the great hall door, informs you that my
lady has left town, or that “the family's in the country,” or “gone up
the Rind,” or what not—as the season and parties are over ; why not
consider Party-giving Snobs for a while, and review the conduct of
some of those individuals who have quitted the town for six months?
Some of those worthy Snobs are making-believe to go yachting, and,
dressed in telescopes and pea-jackets, are passing their time between
Cherbourg and Cowes ; some living higgledy-piggledy in dismal little
huts in Scotland, provisioned with canisters of portable soup, and
fricandeaux hermetically sealed in tin, are passing their days
slaughtering grouse on the moors ; some are dosing and bathing
away the effects of the season at Kissingen, or watching the ingenious
game of Trente et quarante at Hambourg and Ems. We can afford to be
very bitter upon them now they are all gone. Now there are no more
parties, let us have at the Party-giving Snobs. The dinner-giving,
the ball-giving, the déjetíner-giving, the conversazione-giving Snobs—
Lord ' Lord ' what havoc might have been made amongst them had we
attacked them during the plethora of the season ' I should have
been obliged to have a guard to defend me from fiddlers and pastry-
cooks, indignant at the abuse of their patrons. Already I'm told that,
from some flippant and unguarded expressions considered derogatory
to Baker Street and Harley Street, rents have fallen in these
respectable quarters ; and orders have been issued that at least
MR. SNoB shall be asked to parties there no more. Well, then—now
they are all away, let us frisk at our ease, and have at everything, like
the bull in the china-shop. They mayn't hear of what is going on in
their absence, and, if they do, they can't bear malice for six months.
We will begin to make it up with them about next February, and let
next year take care of itself. We shall have no more dinners from
the dinner-giving Snobs. no more balls from the ball-givers : no
more conversaziones (thank Mussy as JEAMEs says,) from the Con-
versazione Snob : and what is to prevent us from telling the truth 2
The Snobbishness of Conversazione Snobs is very soon disposed of,
as soon as that cup of washy bohea that is handed to you in the tea-
room ; or the muddy remnant of ice that you grasp in the suffocating
scuffle of the assembly up stairs.
Good Heavens ! what do people mean by going there 2 What is
done there, that everybody throngs into those three little rooms ? Was
the Black Hole considered to be an agreeable réunion, that Britons
in the dog-days here seek to imitate it After being rammed to a
jelly in a door-way (where you feel your feet going through LADY
BARBARA MACBETH's lace flounces, and get a look from that haggard
and painted old harpy, compared to which the gaze of Ugolixo is
quite cheerful ;) after withdrawing your elbow out of poor gasping
Bob GUTTLEToN's white waistcoat, from which cushion it was im-
possible to remove it, though you knew you were squeezing poor Bob
into an apoplexy—you find yourself at last in the reception-room, and
try to catch the eye of MRs. Botſpol, the conversazione-giver. When
you catch her eye, you are expected to grin, and she smiles too, for
the four hundredth time that night; and, if she's rery glad to see you,
waggles her little hand before her face as if to blow you a kiss, as the
phrase is.
Why the deuce should MRs. BotſBol blow me a kiss 2 I wouldn't
kiss her for the world. Why the deuce do I grin when I see her, as if
I was delighted ? Am I? I don't care a straw for MRs. Boti Bol.
I know what she thinks about me. I know what she said about my
last volume of poems (I had it from a dear mutual friend). Why, I
say in a word, are we going on ogling and telegraphing each other in
this insane way ?—Because we are both performing the ceremonies
demanded by the Great Snob Society : whose dictates we all of us obey.
Well ; the recognition is over—my jaws have returned to their
usual English expression of subdued agony and intense gloom, and
the Boti Bol is grinning and kissing her fingers to somebody else, who
is squeezing through the aperture by which we have just entered. It is
LADY ANN CLUTTERBuck, who has her Friday evenings, as Boti Bol
(Botty, we call her) has her Wednesdays. That is Miss CLEMENTINA
CLUTTERBUCK, the cadaverous young woman in green, with florid
auburn hair, who has published her volume of poems (“the Death-
Shriek ; ” “Damien ; ” “the Faggot of Joan of Arc; ” and “Trans-
lations from the German " — of course)—the conversazione women
salute each other, calling each other, “My dear LADY ANN,”
and “My dear good ELIZA,” and hating each other, as women hate
who give parties on Wednesdays and Fridays. With inexpressible
pain dear good ELIZA sees ANN go up and coax and wheedle ABou
Gosh, who has just arrived from Syria, and beg him to patronise her
Fridays.
All this while, amidst the crowd and the scuffle, and a perpetual
buzz and chatter, and the flare of the wax candles, and an intolerable
smell of musk—what the poor Snobs who write fashionable romances
call “the gleam of gems, the odour of perfumes, the blaze of countless
lamps”—a scrubby-looking, yellow-faced foreigner, with cleaned gloves,
is warbling inaudibly in a corner, to the accompaniment of another.
“The Great CAcAFogo,” MRs. Botibol whispers, as she passes you by |
—“A great creature, THUMPENSTRUMPFF, is at the instrument—the
HETMAN PLATof Fs Pianist, you know.”
To hear this CAcAFogo and THUMPENSTRUMPFF, a hundred people
are gathered together—a bevy of dowagers, stout or scraggy; a faint
sprinkling of misses; six moody-looking lords, perfectly meek and
solemn ; wonderful foreign Counts, with bushy whiskers and yellow
faces, and a great deal of dubious jewellery ; young dandies with slim
waists and open necks, and self-satisfied simpers, and flowers in
their buttons ; the old, stiff, stout, bald-headed concersazione-roués,
whom you meet everywhere—who never miss a night of this delicious
enjoyment; the three last-caught lions of the season—Higgs, the
traveller; Biggs, the novelist ; and Tof FEY, who has come out so on
the sugar question ; CAPTAIN FLASH, who is invited on account of his
pretty wife, and LoRD OGLEBY, who goes wherever she goes—que sais-
|je ? Who are the owners of all those showy scarfs and white neck-
| cloths ?—Ask little ToM PRIG, who is there in all his glory, knows
everybody, has a story about every one ; and, as he trips home to
his lodgings, in Jermyn-street, with his Gibus-hat and his little glazed
pumps, thinks he is the fashionablest young fellow in town, and that
he really has passed a night of exquisite enjoyment.
You go up with (your usual easy elegance of manner) and talk to
Miss SMITH in a corner.

THE CLOSING OF THE OPERA.
F course this event has seriously affected
N the sensibility of the Morning Post,
2 \ which has gone into some very interest-
ing particulars of the destination of the
various members of the company.
LABLAche, with his enormous voice
packed in his tremendous chest, is off
to Naples; LUcILLE GRAIN, making
an elegant little parcel of her entrecháts,
starts for Rome; while CERIto, putting
the poetry of motion into a state of
locomotion, capers up to the railway
station for a professional trip to Liver-
pool. Les Déesses de la Danse are retiring
for the present, not only from The Judg-
ment of Paris, but from the judgment
of London also, and one of them is
about to submit herself to the judgment
of the English provinces. The apples
for which they are going to contend
will be golden pippins, which, we have
no doubt, will be gathered in bushels by
all three of them.
however, made some omissions in his
list of the intended resort of the orna-
ments of Her Majesty's Theatre on the
close of the season. We are happy to
be enabled, on the very best authority,
to supply the deficiency. SIGNOR
ARTURO PADDINGTONI, the second bass
on the O.P. side in the chorus, will go
as first tenor to the Marine Library
at Ramsgate; and the celebrated alto, GUGLIELMo BRUNo, or, as his
intimate friends are in the habit of calling him, SIGNOR BILL BRowN,
will resume his old place in the cider-cellar glees, when the Welsh
Rabbit season recommences."
In the ballet department MADEMOISELLE GREEN will go as the
celebrated danseuse LE VERT, the Tooting TAGLIONI to the Bower
Saloon, where she is engaged to dance the pas de quatre as danced at
Her Majesty's Theatre. It is true that one person may, find a
difficulty in getting through a dance intended for four, but the best
game at whist we ever played in our lives, was one in which we had
the pleasure of playing with three dummies. There was no loss of
temper among the partners on either side, and thus the pas de quatre
of Miss LE VERT will be free from all those professional feelings of
jealousy which in some degree marred the effect of the performance at
the opera.
The graceful and energetic Monsieur TAILLEUR—Anglice, YoUNG
TAYLor—the ninth happy peasant in the ballet of the Somnambula,
will depart for Gravesend as aide-de-camp or attaché to his Terpsi-
chorean Excellency, BARon NATHAN, at Tivoli. Further arrangements
may be known on application to the hall porter of Her Majesty's
Theatre; and it is believed that some of the troupe are still open to
engagements.
The eighty-sixth violin has been offered the leadership of the
ancient concerts held on the Diamond Steam Packets, but he is
expected to close with the Margate Pier Philharmonic Society, as
premier fiddle, with the privilege of introducing a saucer after each
performance.
Start Early.
THE LoRD MAYor announces several grand dinners this week. We
hope his Lordship has given intimation to every one of his guests that
the principal thoroughfares to the City are blocked up, or else he will be
sure to be disturbed in the middle of the night by some unhappy
foreigner who has just come to dinner. His Lordship should put at
the bottom of his invitations, “Dinner at 12 for 6, precisely.”
Our fashionable contemporary has,
| Mrs. Gamp has given us—exclusively too—the following romantic
| narrative that, we trust, will be duly enshrined in the city archives.
“On Monday,” says Mrs. G., “as the floating monster of the Thames,
the city barge, so much famed for fun and festivity,”—(the sly old
woman 1)—
“—was lying under the broad shadows of the trees at Kew, about three o'clock, having
just received on board the committee of the London Bridge Approaches, and their wives
| and daughters, and several other members of the corporation and their ladies, the party
was honoured in a manner they little expected."
Now, draw a long breath, reader, and repress your natural anxiety :—
“SIR PETER LAURIs, casting his searching eye around to find some new matter of
entertainment, espied "-
What ? a tumbler with gold balls, a spring board, and a carpet 2.
A man with dancing-dogs 2 A young lady in spangled white muslin,
with a tambourine, on stilts * No ; none of these : something much
better, more unctuous; far more droll and jolly : for SIR PETER
espied—
“His Royal HighNess the Duke of CAMBRidge calmly surveying the civic prepa-
rations for dinner."
We must doubt part of this. We know the Duke has philosophy; but
we doubt his power of “calmly surveying" any preparations soever
for dinner. However :
“Overjoyed at the discovery. [oh, intensest Snob ( ) the knight, with true corporation,
hospitality, proposed to Mr. Jonks, the chairman, to invite his Royal Highness to par-
take of the good things provided in the barge.”
We do not say that the Duke accepted the invitation.
the reader knows he did. And—
“His Royal Highness remained for some time on board, and expressed much gratifi-
| cation at the entertainment, which he declared was a “rich treat’ to him.”
For already
(Using “treat” in the sense of nothing to pay.) The company, how-
ever, we are told, “were delighted with such an accession to their
enjoyments l’” The Duke made several jokes, but as with great nautical
|judgment, he made them amidships, the barge did not lurch, and the
ladies did not scream. At length the Duke departed ; and then came
the wonder and the gratitude at the lucky cause of his visit. This has
since been differently explained. On one side it has been said that the
Duke was seated in his study, perusing M. SoYER's sumptuous volume
of the cuisine (for kitchen's vulgar), when, as the monster of the
Thames anchored “under the broad shadows of the trees at Kew,”
his Royal Highness—like the war-horse, snuffing the battle afar,
scented the turtle and the venison, and immediately made for the
beach. Another report — that we should hate ourselves could we
believe—states that the whole affair was preconcerted between
CAMBRIDGE and SIR PETER. Certainly, to mean minds, the accident
has a look of arrangement l but then Punch has not a mean mind.
A QUEER CONSECRATION.
THE 13th Light Infantry have received a present of some new colours.
from that distinguished veteran, PRINCE ALBERT. The ceremony of
presentation took place on Southsea Common. In the report of it, as
contained in the Times, we read that—
“The Prince dismounted, and entered the hollow square, accompanied by GENERAL
PAKENHAM, Sir Charles OGLE and Staff, and stood uncovered while the Rev. J. R-
GLEig, Chaplain-General to the Forces, consecrated the colours.”
Consecrated the colours : Is the REv. MR. GLEIG a priest of Mars?
Colours are strange things to be consecrated by a clergyman. Why
not consecrate muskets as well ? Why not pronounce a benediction
over gunpowder, over cartridges, shots, shells, howitzers, and congreve
rockets 2 Why not give a canonical sanction to cannon 2 Is it felt
that this would be going too far, would be too palpable an association
of Christianity with carnage, terms, that in spite of alliteration, will
not harmonise ? Now, it strikes us, that there is a species of con-
secration which would be much more suitable to the emblems of
slaughter than the clerical.
Have any of our readers witnessed the performance of Der
Freischütz If so, perhaps they will anticipate our suggestion. In
the incantation scene, having invoked Zamiel, and in the name of the
demon mixed his lead and sundries of sorcery in the bullet ladle,
“And now,” says Caspar, “for the blessing of the balls.” The benison
recited on this occasion by our friend Caspar would, to our thinking, be
the best adapted to the flag of battle. Give a certain personage his
due. We are not told, that the service performed by the Chaplain to
the Forces was followed by a sermon. Perhaps it was. If so, could
his homily have been the Sermon on the Mount 2

persons who wish to be put down in the Strand or Fleet Street. This is, by crossing
Vauxhall Bridge, keeping all the way on the Surrey side, and coming again into
There are other roads which might, perhaps, be explored ; but it will be time
enough to recommend them when all the London thoroughfares are blocked up.
As soon as this is the case, we have another map in readiness to prove that the
shortest cut from Kensington to the Bank, is by going out of town by the Great
MR. GEORGE ROBINS AND THE CHURCH.
WE have received a letter from MR. GEORGE Robins
denying the assertion of his having a clergyman in con-
nection with his establishment, for the purpose of writing
his advertisements. It appears that those remarkable
mines of learning, those essays in which the deepest
questions of politics are touched off with the lightness
of a feather, those historical essays in which we find data
from the time of NoAH direct down to the afternoon of
yesterday, those magic fancies by which a grassplot
becomes a meadow, and a bank of mustard and cress is
transformed into a verdant slope—all these came from
that mine of CROESUs—or rather, to speak appropriately,
that mine of mustard and cresses—the brain of MR.
GEORGE Robins. We almost regret, for the honour of the
| Church, that it is not one of the clerical body who has
contributed these wondrous specimens of literature to
the classics of our country. But he would not long have
remained obscure, and there is no doubt he would have

the bench of bishops.
Slip-slop Extraordinary.
THE fashionable chronicler of the Morning Post, in a
notice of the christening of the infant son of the EARL
and CountESS OF CALEDON, informs us that
“The noble infant received the patronymic of JAMEs.”
Passengers | We beg to remind our fashionable friend that names
who are bound for the above excursion, should be cautioned to take with them given at the font are called Christian names, not patro-
nymics.
THE SPEAKING MACHINE.
We have been greatly edified by examining the Euphonia, or
Speaking Machine, recently brought to this country by its inventor,
PROFEssoR FABER.
By intense patience, and an ingenious union of wind and India-
rubber, the Professor has succeeded in inventing an instrument, not, as
yet, certainly, complete, but in all respects remarkable ; and which,
combined with other well-known mechanical inventions, may produce
very wonderful results, and a great saving of labour.
There is, for instance, the Verse-grinding Machine, exhibited last
year. Combined with the Euphonia it might be made to produce an
extemporaneous poet who would throw MR. Sloxi.AN, the English Im-
provisatore, into the shade ; and might be taught to recite with
advantage in the houses of the nobility and gentry.
Combined with MR. BABBAGE's Calculating Machine, the Euphonia
might replace, with perfect propriety, a Chancellor of the Exchequer,
or a Mathematical Lecturer at the Universities.
Or let us suppose it united with some such instrument as the
machine shown at the Society of Arts, which composes and sets up
types for the press; and, instead of composing a column of type, it
were to decompose or spell the same :-as one part of the compound
instrument perused each syllable, the phonic part would give it utter-
ance ; and thus, by the aid of a simple grinder at the bellows, long
speeches might be uttered with all the best benefits of emphasis and
oratory, without a Scotch accent like Lord BRough AM's, or a high key
like MR. SHIEL's, or a conventicle twang like SIR Robert's.
A parson might set up the Compound Machine in his pulpit, and
a clerk or curate work it from the reading-desk, whilst his Reverence
was smoking his pipe in the vestry; or an under-secretary might set
the bellows going with a speech of LoRD John's, whilst his Lordship
was taking his usual glass of brandy-and-water at BELLAMY's ; or a
lawyer in full practice might set a score of them to work, and so
actually attend twenty committees at a time; or it might be placed
upon THE THRONE, with the august insignia laid upon the top of the
machine, and the LoRD CHANCELLoR (after kneeling profoundly) might
pop the royal speech into the proper receptacle and blow it out again
to both Houses in the best style.
A clear saving of ten thousand a year might be effected by setting
up a machine en permanence in the Speaker's chair of the House of
Commons. Place the mace before it. Have a large snuff-box on the
side, with rappee and Irish for the convenience of Members, and a
simple apparatus for crying out “Order, order,” at intervals of ten
minutes, and you have a speaker at the most trifling cost, whom SIR
WILLIAM GossETT might keep going all night.
The elocution of the Euphonia is not at present very distinct—say
about as clear as that of His GRACE THE DUKE of WELLINGTON.
When people are not kindly warned beforehand of the words that the
instrument is about to enunciate, they are generally so stupid as not
to understand what it says. In our presence the Euphonia gave vent
to a sentence which nobody understood but ourselves, and our hearts
perhaps divined the cry. It was, “Hour RAH FoR FIGDoRIA.” So the
machine (a German instrument) pronounced the venerated name of
HER MAJESTY.
It sang “God preserve the Emperor” and “God save the Queen"
with such clearness and eloquence, that we really felt we ought to
stand up and take off our hats.
The Machine laughs—but we are bound to say not in a hearty and
jovial manner. It is a hard, dry, artificial laugh ; such as that of
young Misses on the stage, when they give the genteel comedy-giggle;
or of SIR Robert PEEL, when he is amused by some of MR. DisrAELI's
good-natured jokes against him.
ºrrrrrrrrmill.

By the way, why should not LoRD GEORGE BENTINCR have one of
these machines constructed, with a BENJAMIN DISRAELI figure-head,
and play upon it himself at once, and spare the honourable Member for
Shrewsbury the bother of being his Lordship's Euphonia 7
By far the best part of the Euphonia is its hiss ; this is perfect. And
perhaps the fact suggests to the benevolent mind the moral that
hissing is the very easiest occupation of life, which truth is, however,
beside the present question.

... DREADFUL DESTITUTION IN BUCKINGHAM
-- - - . ..., PALACE.
. It is all very well for Doctor SouTHwood SMITH and the MARQUIs
of Norm ANBy, and others, to write and talk about the dreadful
accommodation of the poor. We ask them, Do they know the
sufferings of our Sovereign Lady the QUEEN–of the Field Marshal,
her husband—of the little Princes and Princesses, happily too young
to know the full value of their sorrows 7 In the ignorance of our
democracy, we envied the luxurious conveniences of Buckingham
Palace. For hours and hours have we stood contemplating its body
and two wings, and saying every five minutes, in confidence to our-
selves—“That's a Paradise of stone, that is l There's the Garden of
Eden, without a snake.” . And now—but our feelings are such that we
must begin another paragraph to give vent to them.
Now, we learn that the dwelling-place appointed for our Sovereign,
her Prince, and babies, is a most comfortless abode ; a place of nooks
and corners ; a place of racking noises and villanous odours. Her
Majesty is absolutely lodged—but we take from MR. BloRE's printed
report :—
“The portion of the Palace occupied by HER MAJEsty and His Roy Al HighNEss
PRINCE ALBERT as private apartments, is in the north wing ; that they were not calcu-
lated originally for a married Sovereign, the head of a family; that the basement of this
wing is also used by the Lord Chamberlain's department for store-rooms, workshops, &c.,
there being no accommodation in any other part of the Palace for these services; the
consequence of this arrangement is, not only that the noise and smell from these work-
shops, in which cabinet-makers, upholsterers, smiths, &c., are constantly at work (inde-
pendently of the obvious impropriety of such services being performed in a part of the
building so contiguous to the Royal apartments), are at times positively offensive ; but
that the arrangement is not altogether free from the risk of fire, a quantity of oil being
used, and large fires kept for boiling glue,” &c.
There ! Who, now, will envy the QUEEN of ENGLAND 2 Dear
lady' whilst, in their ignorance, people think she is breathing airs of
Araby, she is offended, stifled, by the fumes of a glue-pot And
when, desirous of pondering on the wants of her people, she wishes to
have a quiet half-hour to herself, she is compelled twenty times to
send out her Maids of Honour to “beg those carpenters not to make
such a dreadful disturbance 1” Who would be the QUEEN, now 2
And then the blessed royal babies. Only see what holes and
corners they are thrust into :—
“It is only necessary to state that the whole of the accommodation which can, at the
| present time, be assigned to the nursery department, consists of a few rooms in the attics
of the north wing; that these rooms are very small and very low, that in order to extend
the accommodation within this very limited space, to meet the growing wants of an
increasing family [Eh *) and increasing establishment, every possible expedient has been
resorted to ; rooms not exceeding 15 feet high, and of small area, have been divided in
their length and width to convert them into smaller rooms; and as the Royal children
could only occupy attics intended for servants, it has been found necessary to cut the
height of the ground-floor story into two, by the assistance of a false ceiling, which has
consigned the servants to darker and more uncomfortable rooms than has been agreeable
to HER MAJESTY's wishes.”
However, the evil is to be remedied. For only £150,000, a sitting-
room and two or three more bedchambers may be built. And then—
be paid for by Government—the Royal Pavilion at Brighton is to be
pulled down (that is, if the Brightonians do not rise in a body to pre-
serve the solemn edifice) and the bricks to be brought to St. James's
Park, to be employed in the necessary alterations.
BABY PATRIOTS.
THE farce of Repeal, instead of coming to an end, is kept up every
day with renewed merriment. MR. O'Connell has elected as a member
of the Association “MASTER THoMAs MAHER, who was born that
morning.” We are afraid the “Hereditary Bondsmen" must be get-
ting rather scarce, if the Great Reliever of Ireland is obliged to call on
a baby to “strike the blow.” One would fancy, too, there had been
squalls enough, lately, in Conciliation Hall, without calling in the
assistance of a new-born infant to increase the disturbance. Where was
“Young Ireland” on the occasion ? It should have moved MasTER
THoMAs MAHER into the chair; or is it waiting till its representative
gives its nurse a few striking proofs of “physical force 7"

to express, when we read: one, of those acts
of atrocity, which fortunately but rarely
disgrace this metropolis. . If not in the very
heart, at least near a large artery of the
City, a wretch has dared to make an attempt,
which has proved too successful, on the pro-
perty of the civic Sovereign. -
The LoRD MAYor, the other day, was robbed
at the Blackwall Railway Station. The gold
watch and appendages of Mayoralty became
the prey of the audacious depredator. We do
not mean, to say that the mace was stolen, or
that the felonious hand was laid on the cap
of maintenance ; the appendages we allude to
were those of the watch, we believe—its seals
and key. . In the midst of his Aldermen,
surrounded by the City Police, that the LoRD.

ROME ONCE MORE THE CITY | A S.I.I P OF THE TO NGU E.
A PARAGRAPH has gone the round of the papers, stating that the
Pope is about to confer on Rome municipal institutions, such as are
possessed by the other chief cities of Europe. Are we, then, to under-
stand that the City of Romulus is to have a Mayor and Aldermen 2
We hope so. She will then have citizens indeed.
In her newly-acquired corporation, her Conscript Fathers will revive,
and the aldermanic gown will worthily replace the toga. We call
upon the Seven Hills, severally and collectively, for a song—a song of
joy. Of course they will supply names for the wards over which the
new-created dignitaries will preside. The Tiber, also, should lend its
aid to the concert ; its bosom swelling, by anticipation, with such joys
as now gladden the Thames. Yes: imagination revels in the idea of
swan-hopping up the Tiber. Already we fancy we behold the Eternal
City barge floating on its yellow waters. We hope these contain
white-bait, and that a Roman Greenwich and Blackwall will be estab-
lished—if they do not already exist—within a convenient distance of
the Vatican.
Although Britons, our classical sympathies have always made us
sorry to see Rome snuffed out by London. True, Rome has a Pope ;

PAR LIAMENTARY TRAIN
-
WE have received several complaints from unfortunate passengers
who are compelled to travel on railroads in third-class carriages. It
appears that—according to the very narrow views of the framers of the
Act—nine inches only are allowed as the width of the seat, and, for the
sake of economy, some of the seats have been placed back to back down
the centre of the vehicle. By this arrangement eighteen inches are
assigned to two of the public, one of whom may be a monopolist of
space, in consequence of his bulk, when, of course, the smaller indivi-
dual does not get the full amount of the accommodation which the law
professes to allow him. It was certainly never contemplated that the
third-class passengers should be compelled to quarrel over their accom-
modation; which they are continually compelled to do by the mode in
which the carriages are constructed. The space allowed is small
enough under any circumstances, and requires a practical acquaintance
with the art of balancing; for it is not very easy to preserve one's
equilibrium upon a ledge about the size of a duodecimo book-shelf.
The difficulty of “holding on” amongst the sudden jerks usually
encountered in railway travelling, is sometimes very considerable, and
the passengers frequently “lap over,” as the old women say—into each
other's laps, with fearful violence.
PLEASING CIRCULAR.
“THE Committee of the Art Union of London regret exceedingly that
they are unable to deliver the prints due for the year 1846, as soon as
they anticipated; the subscribers, however, will receive them three
years earlier than they did those of the year 1842. The very advanced
state of the plates for 1847, 'The Cold Shoulder,’ and “The Pig in a
Poke,”--justifies the announcement that those prints will be issued some
time before the end of the present century.
“Certain untoward causes have retarded the completion of the plate
of the “Battle of the Registration Court, due for is38, but the Com-
mittee will spare no exertions to insure the earliest possible delivery of
the impressions of that very fine work as soon as the talented engraver
begins it.”

THE SANATORY condition of THE city.
According to the Papers, a deputation from
some gentlemen who had met to consider
the sanatory condition of the Metropo-
lis, waited, some time ago, on the Lord
Mayor. “The sum,” says our authority,
“of his lordship's answer to the deputation
was, that he could give no countenance or
assistance to the meeting.” Very likely not.
We would not, if we were the Lord MAYor, give such a meeting any
encouragement. Who knows what it might lead to ? Perhaps to

Your Commissioners find that there exists in the City of London
a species of disorder termed Podagra, or Gout, which is very
prevalent among the Londoners, particularly amongst the Aldermen
and other members of the Corporation. The same individuals are also
grievously troubled with Dyspepsia or Indigestion, and with divers
bilious affections.
Your Commissioners have ascertained that the citizens generally,
and the corporate body in particular, are much
in the habit of frequenting crowded dinner par-
ties, which are principally held in the Halls of
the various Companies. At these are consumed
enormous quantities of all descriptions of viands,
and the more luxurious and less wholesome in a
far greater proportion than the others. In the
meanwhile wines, punch, spirits, beer, and other
exciting and phlogistic drinks are swallowed to an extent that is
incredible.
Your Commissioners trace a large majority of civic diseases to the
civic mode of living, which consists in taking into the stomach too
ample allowances of animal and other substances.
It is the belief of Your Commissioners that the Lond MAYok's
dinner alone gives occasion, annually, for the services of some
hundreds of doctors.
Your Commissioners have to inform you that there are, in the vici-
nity of the City, two localities which are especially
unhealthy. Your Commissioners allude to Green-
wich and Blackwall. They attribute the insalubrity
of these places in part to the white-bait which ac-
cumulates there at certain seasons of the year, but
in a greater measure to the iced punch by which
this evil is accompanied.
Your Commissioners look with great anxiety to
the results, in a sanatory point of view, of the
LoRD MAYoſt's trip to Oxford, which they sincerely
hope may not be such as their experience induces them to apprehend.
In concluding their Report on the sanatory condition of the City,
Your Commissioners feel bound to express their opinion, that though
supply in general must be regulated by demand, yet, for any improve-
ment in the health of the London citizens, it will be absolutely
necessary, by some legislative enactment, to limit their supplies of food
and drink.

THE WELLINGTON STATUE.
It having been determined to submit the WELLINGTon Statue for
three weeks to public opinion, on the top of the arch at Hyde Park
Corner, persons desirous of expressing their sentiments, are requested
to apply immediately to the gate-keeper. No person will be allowed
to exercise the right of voting, unless, he has been proprietor, for at
least three months, of some group or single figure in plaster of Paris,
or other material; and the possession of such figure or group will be
considered a property qualification, entitling the owner to record his
suffrage for or against the statue's continuing in its proposed position.
It has not yet been decided how the votes shall be taken, but it has
been suggested that baskets of eggs, cabbage stalks, or other missiles, shall
be provided for the use of the public, and every article thrown at the
horse shall be considered as one hostile vote, and marked in the poll-
book accordingly. It has also been proposed, that during the election
SIR F.TRENCH shall attend on behalf of the statue, to point out its
magnificent effect from the top of the arch, address the public at the
conclusion of each day's voting, and give any explanation that may be
required. It is also in contemplation to secure the services of some
efficient person on behalf of the public taste, to take the other side of
the question.

A FIGURE OF FUN.
THERE are wheels within wheels, especially in Downing-street. Who
could have anticipated that the peripatetic protectionism of LoRD
GEORGE BENTINCK and MR. DISRAELI was to end in the elevation of
the Duke to his much-contested seat on the arch of Constitution-hill ?
By what mysterious influences, working on the DUKE of RUTLAND,
this has been accomplished we cannot pretend even to guess. But MR.
C. BERKELEY declared it in the House of Commons. Luckily there is
one chance still left to the public taste. The Duke is to be merely a
temporary erection. He is -
to stand for three weeks
on trial; to be put up to
view on his bronze horse
as those of flesh and blood
in the neighbourhood at
TATTERSALL’s. The public
suffrages should be ga-
thered during this time.
IPerhaps the sub-commit-
tee will take it in turns to
of that time; if, on the con-
him, is his opinion to weigh
stand, like omnibus time-
keepers, note-book in hand,
to set down the comments
of the spectators. The Times suggests a register and a balance-sheet.
A form of register might certainly be prepared, with columns, headed
in an ascending and descending scale of praise and blame. The central
point or datum to be 0, meaning “silence,” which must not, how-
ever, be construed into “consent.” The praise table may rise from
the “Pretty well” of severe ignorance, to the “Beautiful” of enthu-
siastic bad-taste, represented by SIR FREDERICK TRENCH. The
condemnation page, which should be very large, may run from the
“What a Guy " of critical cads, to the “Dreadful 1" of MR. DEcIMEs
BURtoN, the outraged architect of the arch, with whom we condole
in the deepest sympathy. Some high authority must be appointed
to check the sub-committee in their registration.
We are afraid, however, that public opinion is to be slighted for that
of “the Government,” “advised,” LoRD MoRPETH assures us, “by
competent persons.” If they disapprove, down comes the Duke, to be
set up in a less questionable position; or melted, and the brass dis-
tributed to the sub-committee, with a double allowance to SIR FRE-
DERICK TRENCH.
We hope that some information will be vouchsafed the public as to
the names of these “competent persons” who are to advise the
Government. Are they to be the same “competent persons” who
approved the designs for the National Gallery and the Trafalgar
Fountains; who recommended the purchase of the Holywell Street
Holbein, and allowed RAPHAEL's Alva Virgin to pass into the hands of
the EMPEROR OF RUssIA 2 Are we again to be at the mercy of those
remarkably “competent persons” who settled the proportions of the
NELSON monument, and the costume of MR. WYATT's GEORGE THE
THIRD 2 The “competent persons” who advise the Government in
matters of art, have succeeded so admirably in filling our streets with
public monuments of the most outrageous absurdity, that we confi-
dently anticipate their approval
of the Duke on the arch. How
can it be otherwise ? It has
always been. What new light
of art has burst upon the Woods
and Forests 2

to return the price of admission

- A statue be not approved, they will
“replace the whole affair in the same circumstances as at present—
viz., remove the statue from the arch, and place it on the ground
again.” We are afraid this promise will be kept like that of the
penny showman. We never remember to have heard of money
returned for the sight of an unsatisfactory giant. As little can we
anticipate that the Duke will ever be compelled to come down if he
is once allowed to get up,

a butt, to all time, for the ridicule of Punch, and a source of bitter
remorse to SIR FREDERICK TRENCH.
We are afraid that that warm-hearted and hot-headed gentleman rates
the influence of Punch on an erroneous principle. That influence
depends very much, we apprehend, on the same causes as the stability
of a government. Among them a “good cry” is well known to be
important. So, if Punch gets a “good cry” he is formidable : if not,
SIR FREDERICK may perhaps venture to defy his baton. Now, while
the Duke continues on the arch, Punch will have an unusually “good
cry.” We shall not be surprised to find it echoing even to Downing-
street, and startling the “competent persons” not out of, but into
propriety. We agree with SIR FREDERICR that the statue, when up,
will be one of the most striking “objects” ever exhibited ; indeed, we
should almost go so far as to say, one of the most “dreadful objects”
that the imagination can conceive. Meanwhile the scaffolding is to
remain, that the Duke may have a staircase to descend by if he do not
give satisfaction. For three weeks FIELD-MARsHAL the DUKE of
WELLINGTON is to be allowed “to enjoy " the testimony of a grateful
country from his bed-room windows: that novel gratification promised
to his Grace by the sub-com-
mittee. If he show a relish for
this luxury, it will be hard to
stop his allowance at the end
trary, we find it too strong for
against that of the “competent
persons 2"
There is one comfort in the
prospect of this three weeks' |
elevation. The absurd dispro-
portion which poor MR. BURTON
strives so desperately to display
in figures, will strike all eyes
in bronze. The ill-fated sup-
port, too small by half for an

for a pedestal, will command that public sympathy which mere drawings
could never create, nor the sufferings of the architect engender. We
should not wonder if even SIR FREDERIck were, at this sight, inspired
by good taste, as suddenly as Orson is endowed with reason in the |
popular melo-drama.

CHAPTER XXVI.-DINING-OUT SNOBS.
N England Dinner-giving Snobs occupy a very
important place in society, and the task of
! describing them is tremendous. There was a
time in my life when the consciousness of
having eaten a man's salt rendered me dumb
ſº regarding his demerits, and I thought it a
| wicked act and a breach of hospitality to
speak ill of him.
But why should a saddle of mutton blind
you, or a turbot and lobster sauce shut your
mouth for ever ? With advancing age, men
see their duties more clearly. I am not to be
hoodwinked any longer by a slice of venison,
be it ever so fat; and as for being dumb on
, , account of turbot and lobster-sauce—of course
# I am ; good manners ordain that I should be
so, until I have swallowed the compound—but
S not afterwards: directly the victuals are
is discussed, and JoHN takes away the plate, my
tongue begins to wag. Does not yours, if you
§ have a pleasant neighbour 2—a lovely crea-
sture, say, of some five-and-thirty, whose
daughters have not yet quite come out—they
are the best talkers. As for your young
misses, they are only put about the table to
look at — like the flowers in the centre-piece. Their blushing
youth and natural modesty prevents them from that easy, confi-
dential conversational abandon which forms the delight of the inter-
course with their dear mothers. It is to these, if he would prosper in
his profession, that the Dining-out Snob should address himself.
Suppose you sit next to one of these, how pleasant it is, in the
intervals of the banquet, actually to abuse the victuals and the giver
of the entertainment | It's twice as piquant to make fun of a man
under his very nose.
What is a dinner-giving Snob 7 some innocent youth, who is not
repandu in the world, may ask—or some simple reader who has not
the benefits of London experience.
My dear Sir, I will show you—not all, for that is impossible—but

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARITVARI. |
several kinds of Dinner-giving Snobs. For instance, suppose you, in
the middle rank of life, accustomed to Mutton, roast on Tuesday, cold
on Wednesday, hashed on Thursday, &c., with small means, and a
small establishment, choose to waste the former and set the latter top-
sy-turvy, by giving entertainments unnaturally costly—you come into
the Dinner-giving Snob class at once. Suppose you get in cheap made
dishes from the pastrycook's, and hire a couple of green-grocers, or
carpet-beaters, to figure as footmen, dismissing honest Molly, who
waits on common days, and bedizening your table (ordinarily orna-
mented with willow-pattern crockery) with twopenny-halfpenny Bir-
mingham plate. Suppose you pretend to be richer and grander than
you ought to be—you are a Dinner-giving Snob. And O, I tremble to
think how many and many a one will read this on Thursday !
A man who entertains in this way—and, alas, how few do not l—is
like a fellow who would borrow his neighbour's coat to make a show
in, or a lady who flaunts in the diamonds from next door—a humbug,
in a word, and amongst the Snobs he must be set down.
A man who goes out of his natural sphere of society to ask Lords,
Generals, Aldermen, and other persons of fashion, but is niggardly of
his hospitality towards his own equals, is a Dinner-giving Snob. My
dear friend, JACK TUFTHUNT, for example, knows one Lord whom he
met at a watering-place ; old LoRD MUMBLE, who is as toothless as a
three-months-old baby, and as mum as an undertaker, and as dull as
—well, we will not particularise. TUFTHUNT never has a dinner now,
but you see this solemn old toothless patrician at the right hand of
MRs. TUFTHUNT—TUFTHUNT is a Dinner-giving Snob.

old CUTLER, the Surgeon, &c., that society of old fogies, in fine, who
give each other dinners round and round, and dine for the mere pur-
pose of guttling—these, again, are Dinner-giving Snobs.
Again, my friend LADY MACScREw, who has three grenadier
flunkies in lace round the table, and serves up a scrag of mutton on
silver, and dribbles you out bad sherry and port by thimblefuls, is a
Dinner-giving Snob of the other sort; and I confess, for my part, I
would rather dine with old LIVERMoRE or old Soy than with her
Ladyship.
Stinginess is snobbish. Ostentation is snobbish. Too great profu-
sion is snobbish. Tuft-hunting is snobbish : but I own there are
people more snobbish than all those whose defects are above mentioned:
viz., those individuals who can, and don't give dinners at all. The
man without hospitality shall never sit sub, iisdem trabibus with me.
Let the sordid wretch go mumble his bone alone !
What, again, is true hospitality ? Alas, my dear friends and
brother Snobs how little do we meet of it after all ! Are the motives
pure which induce your friends to ask you to dinner * This has often
come across me. Does your entertainer want something from you ?
For instance, I am not of a suspicious turn ; but it is a fact, that
when HookEY is bringing out a new work, he asks the critics all
round, to dinner ; that when WALKER has got his picture ready for
the Exhibition, he somehow grows exceedingly hospitable, and has his
friends of the press to a quiet cutlet and a glass of Sillery. Old
HUNKs, the miser, who died lately (leaving his money to his house-
keeper) lived many years on the fat of the land, by simply taking
down, at all his friends', the names and Christian names of all the
children. But though you may have your own opinion about the
hospitality of your acquaintances ; and though men who ask you from
sordid motives are most decidedly Dinner-giving Snobs, it is best not
to inquire into their motives too keenly. Be not too curious about
the mouth of a gift-horse. After all, a man does not intend to insult
you by asking you to dinner.
Though, for that matter, I know some characters about town who
actually consider themselves injured and insulted if the dinner or the
company is not to their liking. There is GUTTLEToN, who dines at
home off a shilling's worth of beef from the cook's shop, but if he is
asked to dine at a house where there are not peas at the end of May,
or cucumbers in March along with the turbot, thinks himself insulted
by being invited. “Good Ged 1" says he, “what the deuce do the
Fokker's mean, by asking me to a family dinner * I can get mutton
at home;” or, “What infernal impertinence it is of the Spooners to get
entrées from the pastrycook's, and fancy that I am to be deceived with
their stories about their French cook " " Then, again, there is JACK
PUDDINGTON.—I saw that honest fellow tº other day quite in a rage,
because, as chance would have it, SIR John CARVER asked him to
meet the very same party he had met at Colonel. CRAMLEY's the day
before, and he had not got up a new set of stories to entertain them.
Poor Dinner-giving Snobs! you don't know what small thanks you get
for all your pains and money ! How we Dining-out Snobs sneer at
your cookery, and pooh-pooh your old Hock, and are incredulous about
your four-and-sixpenny Champagné; and know that the side-dishes
of to-day are réchauffées from the dinner of yesterday, and mark how
certain dishes are whisked off the table untasted, so that they may
figure at the banquet to-morrow. Whenever, for my part, I see the
head man particularly anxious to escamoter a fricandeau or a blanc.
mange, I always call out, and insist upon massacreing it with a spoon.
All this sort of conduct makes one popular with the Dinner-giving Snob.
One friend of mine, I know, has made a prodigious sensation in good
society, by announcing apropos of certain dishes when offered to him,
that he never eats aspic except at LoRD TITTUP's, and that LADY
JIMINY's Chef is the only man in London who knows how to dress—

THE PRICE OF LUXURIES.
It has become a subject of considerable complaint that the price of
the aristocratic amusement of knocking down a London policeman has
latterly been quoted as high as five pounds, a sum which, considering
the ordinary quality of the article assaulted, is generally thought to be
very exorbitant. The extravagance of the price is the more striking
when compared with the much more reasonable rate at which the same
sort of amusement may be had in the provinces. We find from a
police case at Devonport, that the sentries on duty there may be
knocked down for a shilling each—that being the fine imposed on some
one who treated himself to a little pugilistic pastime. "We have no
doubt that they might be knocked down all round for something less,
as there is always “a reduction on taking a quantity.” Perhaps,
however, the liberal principle of charging a single sentry at the whole- |
sale price, may be adopted by the magistrates.

PUNCH AND THE THAMES CHAMPIONSHIP.
It is not, perhaps, generally known that Punch was a competitor in
the late match for the Championship of the Thames; but he went so
far ahead at the very first start, that he got completely out of sight,
and the reporters consequently failed to take any notice of his
achievement.
A man may be too much in advance of his contemporaries, as well as
too much behind them, and Punch in the present instance was in the
former predicament. He went away like lightning, and was fifty miles
beyond the winning-post before his rivals had got fairly into their
work. This of course was accomplished by the superiority of his
skull, and by his having fairly got into the full tide of public favour.
The feathery lightness for which he is so peculiar, also proved very
beneficial to him, and though he pulled away at an enormous rate, it
was the general remark that he seemed fresher than ever, for it is a
peculiarity of Punch, that the longer he works, the greater is his
energy.
3Foreign Hintelligence.
INCE LoRD PALMERSTON has returned to power, the
ferment of the war-party in France has been rather
strong at Boulogne, which forms a very fair baro-
meter of the feelings of the French people. The
Boulonnaise shop-boys have increased the amount
of cire applied to their moustachios, with the view of
waxing ferocious ; and the custom-house veteran
stamps more furiously than ever upon the copies
of Punch that happen to be found among the bag-
gage of passengers. The one gun on the pier has
been black-leaded, in order to give it a more lower-
ing and threatening appearance in the eyes of the English promenaders.
The Cathedral in the Upper Town is progressing as rapidly as the
sale of a book, describing the intended structure, will admit of. The
only funds available for the building are those derived from the
occasional purchase of a descriptive pamphlet by some curious
traveller. As soon as a copy is disposed of, a messenger is despatched
to hire a labourer, who is kept at work as long as there are wages in
hand to remunerate him for his services. By setting him to work in a
position where every blow he strikes with his hammer is answered by
twenty echoes, the place is filled with the delightful sounds of
industry, and the spirits of the artisan are not damped by a feeling of
solitude which would otherwise come over him.
We beg leave to recommend the adoption of this system at the
NELsoN Column Works in Trafalgar Square, where “the man and the
boy” have become the Robinson CRUsoe and FRIDAY of British labour.
By the arrangement of a series of echoes, it might be possible to excite
their imaginations so far as to make them fancy that they are not the
solitaries they have hitherto found themselves. Perhaps here and
there a lay figure in the act of striking a piece of granite, might be
introduced, for the purpose of giving bustle to the scene, and enabling
the man and the boy—“crabbed age and youth”—to feel that they
are not altogether “Alone alone !! alonel ! !” as WERNER has it, in
the centre of the great metropolis.
Raising the Wind,
THE German Band has left Ramsgate. They were compelled at last
to make a raffle of their instruments before they could get money
enough to leave the place. A young lady of fortune got the Ophicleide,
whilst the Serpent fell to the lot of a wealthy inhabitant, who had
tempted the unfortunate band to visit the town.
The LONG WACATION.
A PASTRY-cook in Fleet Street, finding he did not sell a bun a day,
has shut up shop, and written on his shutters, “Gone to America,
during the Repairs.” -
REASONS FOR PULLING DOWN WESTMINSTER BRIDGE.
THE following is the Report which has been lately published by the
Committee appointed to inquire into the state of Westminster
Bridge :-
The foundation is giving way, and the Bridge sinks every year.
There is never more than one arch passable at a time.
It is blocked up every other month.
It is decidedly dangerous.
It is anything but ornamental.
It is no longer useful.
If it is not pulled down, it will either fall in, or else be carried away.
It will cost a less sum to build a new bridge than to keep the present
one in repair.
We must say we never recollect reading a report more convincing
than the above.

PUNCH*S HISTORICAL PORTRAIT GALLERY.
RICHARD THE THIRD.
This extraordinary individual is better known by his appearance
on the stage, than from the pages of history, and we therefore prefer
adopting the dramatic version of his character.
of walking up and down the streets of London, indulging in soliloquies
on his own deformity, and developing his plans of ambition in very
loud talking, which might easily have been overheard by the servant-
girls or others looking out of the windows in the neighbourhood.
The first glimpse we get of him is in one of these promenades, in the
course of which he was continually rapping the palm of his left hand
with a truncheon carried in his right, making sudden stops, indulging
in winks, sneers, sardonic grins, and other eccentric movements, con-
cluding with a loud announcement of his intention to “prove a villain.”
This determination he seems to have carried out to the letter, by a
series of assassinations and hypocrisies.
From his mother's description of him, which we have no doubt was
painfully accurate, we learn that he was a most unmanageable baby,
“tetchy and wayward” in his infancy, refusing his bottle when
tendered, and crying for it when it was most inconvenient to give
it him.
He spent the prime of his life in extinguishing prosing old kings,
smothering his nephews, giving orders for chopping off miscellaneous
heads, and bamboozling the DUKE of BUCKINGHAM. The last
great act of his life—his combat with the DUKE of RichMond—has
been differently represented by various authorities. Some make him
fight only for a few seconds; others show him struggling, cutting,
thrusting, gasping, and slashing, for full a quarter of an hour. The
probability is, that he gave a good deal of trouble to his conqueror, by
an obstinate knack of clashing sword against sword, than from any
difficulty there might have been in subduing him.

THE SNOBS OF ENGLAND.
By one or TeleMSELVEs.
CHAPTER XXVII.
DINNER-GIVING SNOBS FURTHER CONSIDERED.
F my friends would but follow the
present prevailing fashion, I think
they ought to give me a testimonial
for the paper on Dinner-giving Snobs,
which I am now writing. What do
you say now to a handsome comfort-
able dinner-service of plate (not
including plates, for I hold silver
plates to be sheer wantonness, and
would almost as soon think of silver
tea-cups), a couple of neat tea-pots, a
coffee-pot, trays, &c., with a little in-
scription to my wife, MRs. SNoB ; and
a half-score of silver tankards for
the little Snoblings, to glitter on the
homely table where they partake of
their quotidian mutton ?
If I had my way, and my plans
could be carried out, dinner-giving
would increase as much on the one
hand as dinner-giving Snobbishness
would diminish;-to my mind, the
most amiable part of the work lately,
published by my esteemed friend
he will allow me to call him so),
ALEXIS SoYER, THE REGENERATOR ;
what he (in his noble style) would call the most succulent, savoury,
and elegant passages, are those which relate, not to the grand banquets
and ceremonial dinners, but to “his dinners at home.”
The “dinner at home" ought to be the centre of the whole system
of dinner-giving. Your usual style of meal that is plenteous, com-
fortable, and in its perfection, should be that to which you welcome
your friends, as it is that of which you partake yourself.
For, towards what woman in the world do I entertain a higher
regard than towards the beloved partner of my existence, MRs. SNoB 2
who should have a greater place in my affections than her six brothers
(three or four of whom we are pretty sure will favour us with their
company at seven o'clock), or her angelic mother, my own valued
mother-in-law f—for whom, finally, would I wish to cater more gener-
ously than for your very humble servant, the present writer 7 Now,
nobody supposes that the Birmingham plate is had out, the disguised
carpet-beaters introduced to the exclusion of the neat parlour-maid,
the miserable éntrées from the pastrycook's ordered in, and the children
packed off, (as it is supposed) to the nursery, but really only to the
staircase, down which they slide during the dinner-time, waylaying
the dishes as they come out, and fingering the round bumps on the
jellies, and the forced-meat balls in the soup. Nobody, I say, supposes
that a dinner at home is characterized by the horrible ceremony, the
foolish makeshifts, the mean pomp and ostentation which distinguish
our banquets on grand field-days.
Such a notion is monstrous. I would as soon think of having my
dearest BEssy sitting opposite me in a turban and bird of Paradise,
and showing her jolly mottled arms out of blonde sleeves, in her
famous red satin gown : aye, or of having MR. ToolE every day, in a
white waistcoat, at my back, shouting out “Silence ſaw the chair l’”
Now, if this be the case; if the Brummagem-plate pomp and the
processions of disguised footmen are odious and foolish in every-day
life, why not always * Why should Jones and I, who are in the
middle rank, alter the modes of our being to assume an éclat which
does not belong to us—to entertain our friends, who (if we are worth
anything, and honest fellows at bottom) are men of the middle rank too,
who are not in the least deceived by our temporary splendour; and who
. off exactly the same absurd trick upon us when they ask us to
ine 7
If it be pleasant to dine with your friends, as all persons with good
stomachs and kindly hearts will, I presume, allow it to be, it is better
to dine twice than to dine once. It is impossible for men of small
means to be continually spending five-and-twenty or thirty shillings
-
(if upon a very brief acquaintance
on each friend who sits down to their table. People dine for less. I
myself have seen, at my favourite Club, (the Senior United Service.)
His Grace the DUKE of WELLINGTON quite contented with the joint,
one-and-three, and half-pint of Sherry wine; and if His Grace, why
not you and I?
This rule I have made, and found the benefit of. Whenever I ask
a couple of Dukes and a Marquis or so to dine with me, I set them
down to a piece of beef, or a leg of mutton and trimmings. The
grandees thank you for this simplicity, and appreciate the same. My
dear Jones, ask any of those whom you have the honour of knowing,
if such be not the case.
I am far from wishing that their Graces should treat me in a simi-
lar fashion. Splendour is a part of their station, as decent comfort
(let us trust) of yours and mine. Fate has comfortably appointed gold
plate for some, and has bidden others contentedly to wear the willow
pattern. And being perfectly contented, (indeed humbly thankful—for
look around, O Jones, and see the myriads who are not so fortunate),
to wear honest linen, while magnificos of the world are adorned with
cambric and point-lace ; surely we ought to hold as miserable, envious
fools, those wretched Beaux TIBBs's of society, who sport a lace dickey,
and nothing besides. The poor silly jays, who trail a peacock's feather
behind them, and think to simulate the gorgeous bird whose nature it
is to strut on palace-terraces, and to flaunt his magnificent fan-tail in
the sunshine.
The jays with peacocks' feathers are the SNoBs of this world : and
never since the days of AEsop were they more numerous in any land,
than they are at present in this free country.
How does this most ancient apologue apply to the subject in hand
—the dinner-giving Snob The imitation of the great is universal
in this city, from the palaces of Kensingtonia and Belgravia, even to
the remotest corner of Brunswick Square. Peacocks' feathers are
stuck in the tails of most families. Scarce one of us domestic birds
but imitates the lanky, pavonine strut, and shrill, genteel scream. O
you misguided dinner-giving Snobs, think how much pleasure you
| lose, and how much mischief you do with your absurd grandeurs and
hypocrisies ' You stuff each other with unnatural forced-meats, and
entertain each other to the ruin of friendship (let alone health) and the
destruction of hospitality and good-fellowship—you, who but for the
peacock's tail might chatter away so much at your ease, and be so
jovial and happy
When a man goes into a great set company of dinner-giving and
dinner-receiving Snobs; if he has a philosophic turn of mind, he will
consider what a huge humbug the whole affair is ; the dishes and the
the conversation, and the company, the philosopher included.
The host is smiling and hob-nobbing, and talking up and down the
| table ; but a prey to secret terrors and anxieties lest the wines he has
brought up from the cellar should prove insufficient; lest a corked bottle
should destroy his calculations ; or our friend the carpet-beater, by
| making some berue, should disclose his real quality of green-grocer,
and show that he is not the family butler.
The hostess is smiling resolutely through all the courses, smiling
speculating with terror lest there be any disaster there. If the soufflé
should collapse, or if Wiggins does not send
the ices in time—she feels as if she would
commit suicide—that smiling, jolly woman
The children up-stairs are yelling, as
their maid is crimping their miserable ring-
lets with hot tongs, tearing Miss EMMY's
hair out by the roots, or scrubbing Miss
Polly's dumpy nose with mottled soap
till the little wretch screams herself into fits.
The young males of the family are em-
ployed, as we have stated, in piratical
exploits upon the landing-place.
The servants are not servants, but the
before-mentioned retail tradesmen.
The plate is not silver, but a mere shiny
Birmingham lacquer; and so is the hospi-
tality, and everything else.
The talk is Birmingham talk. The wag
of the party, with bitterness in his heart, having just quitted his
laundress, who is dunning him for her bill, is firing off good stories;
and the opposition wag is furious that he cannot get an innings.
JAwRINs, the great conversationist, is scornful and indignant with the
pair of them, because he is kept out of court. Young MuscADEL, that
cheap dandy, is talking Fashion and ALMACR's out of the Morning Post,
drink, and the servants and the plate, and the host and hostess, and -

never been there. The widow is vexed out of patience, because her
daughter MARIA has got a place beside young CAMBRic, the penniless
curate, and not by Colonel GoLDMoRE, the rich widower from India.
The doctor's wife is sulky, because she has not been led out before the
barrister's lady; old Doctor CoRK is grumbling at the wine, and
GUTTLEToN sneering at the cookery.
And to think that all these people might be so happy, and easy,
and friendly, were they brought together in a natural unpretentious
way, and but for an unhappy passion for peacocks' feathers in England.
Gentle shades of MARAT and Robespie RRE 1 when I see how all the
honesty of society is corrupted among us by the miserable fashion-
worship, I feel as angry as MRs. Fox just mentioned, and ready to
order a general battue of peacocks.
THE LOW THER ARCADE BLOC KAD E.
£7 THE thoroughfare through the Lowther Arcade gradually gets
smaller and smaller. It is now reduced to the width of a narrow
bookshelf. Two persons walking abreast cause a collision, which is
frequently attended with serious damage to the adjoining pomatum
pots. The little rivulet of pavement might be enlarged, we think, by
encroaching on each side upon the immense meadow of crockery-ware.
It is not pleasant, as you are walking along, to put your foot into a
drum, or to fall at full-length upon a tea-tray of child's tea-things.
The toymakers should be told to take their shops indoors. The exhi-
bition of dolls and rocking-horses may be very pleasing to the juvenile
eye, and very profitable to the shopkeepers, but we caution parents
who recklessly enter the Arcade with their children, to stipulate before-
hand with the beadle not to pay for breakages. The shower of hail-
stones lately did in a measure clear the Arcade, but now that the sky-
lights have been mended, the Birmingham and Wedgewood trumperies
have come out in greater abundance than ever. A fireman should be
engaged to play down the Arcade three times a day. A strong column
of water might probably create an opening in favour of the pedestrian,
who does not like being stopped at every step by a monster rocking-
horse, or tripped up by a lambswool poodle.
OST OR STOLEN.—THE PRUSSIAN CONSTITUTION. It was
done up in a small parcel, and was dropped about the 3rd of last month. It was
last seen at the Sans Souci, Potsdam, where it had been lying on the shelf for years.

small reward will be given for its restoration to “Frederick, Royal Palace, or Greek

so, if the results of our inquiries into their mental circumstances may

more in his way. Does not see what a British officer can possibly have

Another build not, I entreat;
I’ve houses plenty,+quite.
If you your cash would spend,
If you’d invest your gold,
Build almshouses, no end,
To lodge the poor and old ;
Build hospitals, and more
Asylums open free ;
Build schools of charity in store ;
But no more seats for me !
THE TEMPERANCE CONVENTION.
ToM Hood has capitally said of certain teetotalers, that they think
they have a right to believe themselves Beauties, simply because they
are not Beasts. Assuredly, many of the water-spouters recently
playing at Covent Garden Theatre are of this notion. It would be
difficult to brew or distil any beverage stronger or more deleterious
than much of their language. The American apostles of Temperance
—like many other saints—have made themselves especially notorious
for unseemly words. Never was water dirtied with fouler words.
The Rev. Thomas BRAYNARD, however, of Philadelphia, has settled
the question by shifting it upon the shoulders of weak woman ; whom
he twitted with an indiscretion (now of a few thousand years' standing)
in a very shabby spirit. He said, “One Woman had ruined the world
by persuading a man to eat, and it was now for woman to show an
example by persuading him not to drink.” Eve having plucked the
apple, it was the duty of her daughters to set their faces against cyder,
We would by no means be thought to undervalue the blessings of
Temperance as preached by FATHER MATHEw and others ; but when
we read the stuff that has recently been uttered in the cause of total
abstinence, we certainly do feel inclined to wish that at Covent Garden
the authorities had imitated certain Strand authorities at Church time,
Theatre, Berlin." For fear of accidents, it had better be labelled “Fragile.”

THE EXILES OF LAMBETH.
LAMBETH has become a sort of Siberia since the stopping
up of Westminster Bridge, for there is now literally no commu-
nication between the inhabitants of the Northern shore, and the
transpontine people.
All means of social intercourse are completely cut off, and
Astley's Amphitheatre might as well be on Salisbury Plain,
as far as there is any possibility of getting to it from any part
of Westminster. We have heard of vessels wrecked in sight of
port, but here is a place of amusement remaining comparatively
empty, with crowds walking within a stone's throw and unable
to get to it.
Lambeth is in a state of utter desolation, and the principal
street reminds one of a strada in Pompeii. A civil war might
break out and be all over before any one on this side of the
Thames could know anything about it.
The people are becoming quite isolated from the rest of their
fellow-subjects, and the interests of civilization are severely
suffering. Already Lambeth is a week behind us in the polite
arts, and every day that the blockade continues will send them
backward four-and-twenty hours towards the barbarism which
it has taken centuries to get out of We should not be at all
surprised at hearing through some circuitous channel that a
provisional Government has been established in the New Cut,
and that the whole of the Marsh has thrown off its allegiance.
During the stoppage of Westminster Bridge, the Lambethites
are aliens in geography if not in blood, and we can scarcely
expect submission where protection is not afforded.

SHOPKEEPERs are complaining dreadfully about the placing

THE BARON OF ROSHERWILLE.
THE ancient barony of Nathan has, during the last few months,
been conglomerated with the modern fiefdom of Rosherville. BARON
NATHAN has recently had an assemblage of friends, retainers, and
vassals, at an annual benefit. His proclamation announcing the
solemnity, combined the spirit of old chivalry with the effervescing
essence of puffery. He put forth a placard, in which feudal pride
seemed to be struggling with everyday quackery. His appeals to the
British fair breathed all the ardour of old romance ; but his allusions
to the prices, and his promise of a late omnibus, for the accommodation
of parties coming from a distance, were couched in the stern language
of dull reality. When, however, he prattled of polkas, the poet seemed
to stand before us, reminding us of the period of the troubadours,
particularly when he promised to open the ball with some “fayre
ladye pupille" in the Gavotte de Vestris.
But the most interesting feature in the programme was the pledge to
dance his celebrated egg hornpipe. This gave a wondrous whet to
public curiosity, and it was even rumoured that he intended to conclude
it with a terrific pas de batter, by plunging in among the oval delicacies
at the termination of his terpsichorean effort. Some laid three to one
on the event ; but a hen of Bohemia—according to the Baron's assertion
—laid such enormous odds that it was quite impossible to doubt the truth
of the Baron's intentions. Many had disbelieved the fact of the lordly
NATHAN having ever capered among the crustaceous produce of the
farm-yard, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and the proof
of the egg polka, or pas d'omelette, has been in the dancing.
Everything seems to have been couleur de rose, except the grass
and the trees—at the Baron's benefit. He has issued a grateful half-
sheet of printed post, in which he first praises himself for being not
only what he is but something more, and he then goes into a brief
eulogy on those who patronized his benefit. He thanks those for “their
forbearance who were quite debarred from obtaining a view of the
amusements,” and it certainly did show considerable amiability to stand
huddled together on grass and gravel-walks, straining the eye to catch
everything and seeing nothing.

LIBERTY OF THE PRESS.
O'ConnELL, the uncrowned monarch of Ireland, has expelled the
Nation newspaper from all the Repeal reading-rooms in Ireland.
MARSHAL BUGEAUD, the uncrowned monarch of Algeria, has established
a censorship at Algiers, which has been the death of two papers which
were published at the capital of his dominions. The cause of these
two despotic acts was too great a freedom in discussing the govern-
ment of the two uncrowned monarchs. Kings BUGEAUD and
O'Connell will not allow the smallest stain to be cast upon their
future thrones. A paper must praise, and that in no small degree, or
else be immediately suppressed. We think KING DAN might take a
lesson from his brother monarch, and establish a censorship at Concil-
iation Hall, to watch over the liberty of the Irish press. In the mean
time, the following simple rules might be sent to all editors, Algerian
as well as Hibernian, to guide them in the insertion of articles. They
are scarcely strong enough, but they will do for the present, till the
monarchs are crowned, when something much stronger can, of course,
be enforced :-
You must on all occasions evince the greatest admiration for your
uncrowned monarch. Any editor daring to have an opinion of his own,
will have his paper immediately apprehended for the first offence, and
abolished for the second.
The trade and commerce of the uncrowned monarch's dominions
must be always increasing.
There must be no monarch in the world to be compared to your un-
crowned monarch, and no kingdom to be half so flourishing as his
kingdom.
Repeal and ABD-EL-KADER to be excluded subjects of comment,
unless it is to say, that the one will be taken, and the other will be
carried to-morrow.
England, and the influence of its gold, to be at all times an open
subject.
Any article sent by the uncrowned monarch to have immediate
insertion.
All jokes, epigrams, rumours, riddles, &c. to be rigidly excluded.

A HINT FOR THE DEAN AND
Now that the price of the exhibition of the Abbey is so much
reduced, the object of the authorities seems to be the gaining of the
greatest possible amount of speed in carrying the public through the
building. The Dean and Chapter have made the discovery that “it is
only the quantity that can pay,” and as a single visitor can claim to be
admitted at the wholesale price, the only chance consists in driving a
wholesale business.
CHAPTER OF WESTMINSTER. |

For this purpose it is proposed to introduce the railway system
into the Abbey, so that parties may be carried in large quantities up
and down, at a great velocity. A train should start every five
minutes, and day-tickets might be granted at a trifling increase of
fare to those who should be desirous of taking a less cursory glance than
would be afforded by the rapidity at which the train would necessarily
travel.

For I am weak and miserably old.

And JENKINs—like a true man-loving those times when the sweet
brow of our fatherland was a little flattened by broad-wheeled waggon;
never goes by rail, but always travels in the slowest coach, whi
fully accounts for the very early intelligence always to be found in the

THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
M I SS R O B | N S O N C R U S O E.
CHAPTER X.
- HAVIN G now brought myself to look upon
solitude and a single life as my future
doom, I determined to make the misfor-
t tunes, as far as I could, endurable.
Looking upon my hut as my home for
the natural course of my life, I resolved
to furnish it with all the necessaries in
my power. The surgical instrument
case, of which I have before spoken,
was of the highest service to me. It
enabled me to cut down a large supply
of osiers, which grew in great abund-
| ance, as I afterwards discovered, at
| what I take it was the north-north-
eastern by west part of the island.
As a child I always displayed great
precocity and taste in the manufacture
of rush baskets. Indeed, I could make
rushes into anything. This faculty was,
-
£º -
at my need, of the greatest service to me. and thus, in progress
of time, I had completely furnished my hut with chairs and tables and
stools, and, at length, a bedstead—for I grew tired of the hammock
—of wicker-work. Of course, this was the result of a long period ;
but then, time was of all things the cheapest and most plentiful com-
modity with me. My furniture, when completed, had a very light and
pleasing effect; and, I assure you, made me often think with a sigh
of pity upon the vanities of mahogany and satin-wood. As I continued
to make improvements in my hut, I found I required a ladder : this
I managed to make of rope and wicker ; by which means I was ena-
bled to climb into an upper chamber, drawing up my ladder after me.
I had seen no signs of a human animal; nevertheless, I thought it
was only a proper precaution to be provided against the worst.
The rainy season having set in, I began to write my journal, to
which—as it is at this moment in the hands of a distinguished
| publisher, and will, in the season, appear under the title of Nights with
the Cannibals—I shall no further allude. (It will be sufficient for me,
if the withering satire contained in that aquafortis volume shall be the
means of awakening the savages to a proper sense of Almack's and
the Italian Opera.)
During the time employed upon my wicker-work, I continued to
make daily rambles about the island, to see what I could catch. I
discovered to my great delight, that the place abounded with ring-
doves. I managed to obtain some of the young, which I brought to
my hut. These beautiful creatures—emblems of household and
conjugal affection—increased exceedingly ; and thus, in process of
time, I never wanted a ring-dove for my supper. It went to my
heart, of course, to kill them, at first ; but custom and hunger soon
reconciled me to the inconvenience. After a time, rummaging about, I
found whole hives of wild honey and wax. The latter was of especial
service to me, as, my candles getting every night shorter and shorter,
I know not what I should have done for a light ; for to have slept
without a candle—and in an uninhabited island—would have been
insupportable. The wax, however, with cotton that I ravelled out
from some articles of dress, made me very endurable tapers. I had,
in my time, burnt better wax ; but for home-made lights they were
not the worst.
About this time, I was fortunate enough to be visited by an earth-
quake. I say fortunate ; for though, while it lasted, I was very much
terrified—and very much wished for one of the earthquake gowns that
HoRACE WALPole, I think it is, says was very much in fashion in
his time, when earthquakes used regularly to visit London—never-
theless, as the island and the sea being well shaken, caused the wreck
of the ship that lay at the bottom of the ocean, to be thrown high and
dry ashore-I was enabled to come at a great many articles that, in
my hurry and confusion, I had been unable to carry away upon my raft.
It was on one of my visits to the wreck, that going down upon the
beach, I discovered what, at first, I took to be a strange sea-monster,
lying upon the shore. At length, after much examination, I concluded
that the creature was a turtle. I remembered that I had once seen
such a thing at the door of a London tavern, when a child, with my
father ; and how my honoured parent, to my surprise, suddenly paused
before the fish, contemplating it with an emotion that, at that time, I
was far too young to understand.
With considerable difficulty I carried the turtle to my hut, resolving
to dress it. Whereupon I immediately consulted that precious volume, |
the Cookery Book, fortunately discovered in the clergyman's cabin. I
knew that I had not the proper means of dressing the turtle, and there-
fore felt (by anticipation, of course) what the inimitable and immortal
SoYER has since delivered to the world. “Is it not bad enough to
have sacrificed the lives of these animaua bienfaisans to satisfy our
indefatigable appetites, without pulling and tearing to atoms the
remains of our benefactors ? It is high time, for the credit of
humanity, and the comfort of quiet families, to put an end to the
massacre of these innocents.” With these thoughts, I addressed
myself to the Cookery Book. I knew very well before I opened it
that I had not a single ingredient proper for the dressing ; neverthe- |
less, I took a strange, a wayward delight in reading the directions—
they afforded me such pleasures of the imagination. It was something
in that dreadful solitude even to read of “a quantity of very rich
broth of veal,”—“green onions, and all sorts of seasoning herbs,”—
“cayenne and the juice of lemons ;” with, as a crowning delight, “two
bottles of Madeira !” Thinking of these things, and looking at my
turtle—and knowing, at the same time, that it must be eaten plain; not
honoured by any dressing—so to speak—soever, I could not help com-
paring its fate with my own. Here it was, a beautiful turtle—a turtle
that, in London, would have fetched I know not how many pounds—a
turtle that would have gathered about it the choicest company of the
land, cooked with exceeding care, and praised with exceeding praises;
yet nevertheless doomed to be eaten in a desolate island, without a drop |
|
i
of veal broth, a pinch of cayenne, a squeeze of lemon, or a single glass
of Madeira. Thinking thus of the turtle, and pondering upon my
own condition, the reflective and sympathetic reader will not, cannot
be surprised to learn that—I wept.
Let me, however, conclude this chapter in good spirits. The turtle's
eggs I found delicious.
ANOTHER WATERLOO EXILE.
" A conFIDENTIAL friend of the DUKE of WELLINGTON has written
to us to state that the Hero of a Hundred Fights has determined upon
leaving England. He says this resolution has cost the Duke a deal of
pain, but he has been driven to it by the statues which are being
erected to him in all parts of London. He says he cannot endure being
made ridiculous any longer. He attributes these frequent attempts to
reduce him in the estimation of his countrymen to the vindictiveness
of the French. ...

102 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
~-
The popular motion of NApoleoN in this country is founded on the
very vaguest materials, but our researches have embraced nearly all
the sources of information from the old original casts in plaster of
Paris, down to the version recently given by ToM THUMB of the cha-
racter of BUoNAPARTE. Nor have we neglected the light thrown on the
biography of the Emperor by the graphic delineations of MR. Gomer-
SAL ; as well at the illustration afforded by the management of Covent
Garden Theatre some seasons ago, when NApoleon's identical hat drew
tremendous half-prices for several weeks in succession.
All the authorities seem to agree in making BUoNAPARTE an invete-
rate snuff-taker, with a great propensity for promoting men from the
ranks to the highest posts in the army, merely because he remembered
seeing them elsewhere on some previous occasion. He seems to have worn
the grey great-coat of a British private soldier—possibly taken in some
battle with the English; and though the garment might well be adapted
for winter wear, his pertinacity in sticking to it through the hot as
well as the cold weather, affords a striking proof of the determination
of the Emperor's character. Whatever his military achievements
might have been, his principal weapon was a small eyeglass; and
indeed either this or a telescope is the ordinary substitute for a sword
in the hands of a General. §º on a hill, quite out of harm's way,
and looking through a glass, rendered necessary by the remoteness of
the scene of action, the leader of the forces usually performs those feats
of valour which render him the hero of the day without the bother of
sharing its dangers.
The ordinary notion of NApoleoN, however, represents him as
always the first in any enterprise; acting as his own pioneer, hacking
down bridges with his own sword, and cutting a passage large enough
for his own somewhat corpulent frame through the Alps, in order to
afford space for the rest of the army to follow him. The later versions
of his character exhibit him rather in a reflective than an active mood,
and he is seen, in the statues as well as the delineations of ToM THUMB,
pacing to and fro with folded arms, as if probably meditating something,
but positively doing nothing.
ere is a curious old conundrum in some archives to which we have
the exclusive privilege of referring, which, as it relates to the French
Emperor, we may be excused for concluding our notice with. It is
asked “Why NApoleon cannot have been a good soldier ** The
answer is, “Because, when he died, he was very little better than half
a sent'ry.” In a note to this quaint riddle we find it stated, that as
NAPoleon died at the age of fifty-two, he was really little better than
half a cent'ry.
I)READFUL CONDITION OF RAMSGATE.
A commespoxDENT of the Times is very indignant with the Ramsgate
bathers. Among other matters to be redressed he says, “The ladies
dance polkas in their bathing-dresses (we have further heard that
WeiPPERT's Yellow-Sand Band is engaged to accompany them), and
- - - --~-
that “chairs are let out at a penny Rece," for the vulgar multitude to
sit at their ease amd behold the precious dippers. The “Visitor”
indignantly writes of the lady-bathers:—
“If they appear beyond the awning (which, by the bye, ought to be kept in a proper
state of repair), a policeman or two ought to be stationed on the sands to call out" to
them, and thus particularly direct attention to the offending parties.”
Calling out to them is a very poor—very inefficient remedy. Why
not let every policeman—like men of the preventive service—be armed
with a gun, and so, after the first warning, fire upon the offenders? Or
licenses might be granted by the authorities of Ramsgate to sporting
gentlemen ; and so, a decent sum be raised for the benefit of the town
from the dear duck shooting.
MORE HOLIDAYS FOR PARLIAMENT.
THE closing parliamentary period is usually termed the fag-end of
the session; which is a glaring misnomer; for the session's end is re-
markable for anything but fag. For uproarious propensities, for trivial
altercation, and other juvenile peculiarities, the House of Commons has
often been compared to a great school. In one particular, especially,
do Members resemble school-boys, namely, in running out of bounds
and playing truant as soon as they become tired of work. As the
Black Rod is a mere phantom of a scourge and its Usher but a shadow
of a pedagogue, some other method than punishment should be adopted
with these urchins of the senate. We suspect that they have insuffi-
cient play-hours.
Perhaps the Easter and Whitsuntide vacations are too short. Indeed.
|judging from the speeches of many of our representatives, we should
ascribe their prevailing quality to that of “all work and no play,” of
which the effects on the boy JACK are proverbial. It may therefore
be advisable that now and then a day, or at least a portion of one, extra,
should be allowed to Members of Parliament for recreation. The
power of granting it might be vested in the SPEAKER, and it would be
with as much delight as amusement that we should hear Colonel SIB-
THoRPE say to him, “Please, Sir, will you give us a half-holiday ?”
Ibrahim Pacha in the House of Cornmons.
THE Times' Correspondent, writing of the arrival of IBRAHIM PACHA,
gossiping at home, says:—
“He described the House of Commons, where he saw some members very shabbily
dressed, others asleep in very undignified positions, and snoring whilst the proceedings
were going on, and others calling out, ‘Haw! haw! haw tº his Highness imitating the
position and the cries of “Hear, hear.’”
This is a mistake. When his Highness imitated “honourable Mem-
bers” he did not merely cry, “Hawl haw l’” but “He—haw He-
haw .. " -
SALE EXTRAORDINARY.
IN consequence of the close of the legislative season, it has been
determined to get rid of the large remaining stock of unredeemed
pledges by public auction. There are several very bad lots among the
number, and the pledges are most of them in such a very bad condition,
that it is feared the prices fetched will be very contemptible. The
celebrated clothes stolen from the Whigs while bathing, will, we under-
stand, be found in the catalogue, but as all the coats belonging to these
clothes have been turned over and over again, until they scarcely
retain any of their original gloss, it is very unlikely that they will
fetch anything worth mentioning.
MR. BENJAMIN DISRAELI, and some of the other regular dealers, will
no doubt attend, in the hope of picking up bargains here and there ;
but the indisposition of parties to have any dealings with him, will
prevent his becoming a purchaser to any amount at the sale which is
in contemplation.
The IDuke's Statues
WE understand that there will be a severe contest between public
opinion and SIR F. TRENch's Committee on the subject of the DUKE
of WELLINGTox's Statue. There is to be a regular polling booth
erected at Hyde Park Corner, for the purpose of taking the votes of
the passengers. For our own parts we think there ought to be some
extensive canvassing, which would have the effect of concealing the
Statue from view, and we are of opinion that the DUKE ought to be
returned (to the ground) by a very large majority.

THE SONG OF THE STATUE.
THE Committee are met, the mould is set,
The Duke is cast to-day !
MR. WYATT–pray be quiet !
TRENCH-out of the way l
The casting must be done
Ere the set of sun 1
The work may do the sculptor credit,
But, from all he's done—we dread it.
Another statue ! Take a warning—
Take from Punch an earnest word 1
The Fourth GEORGE's tunic scorning
Boots and tail of GEoRGE THE THIRD.
Prances one by Bank of RANsoM,
On Paté de Perigord,
Shews the other legs so handsome
As legs were only shewn of yore.
While in Palace Yard, GEORGE CANNING,
Taller, greener than in life,
Blanket round him wrapp'd, is scanning
Members rushing to the strife.
You fail, if literal, as the first is ;
Ideal, as the last, you fail;
Hard to say which fault the worst is—
Jack-boots, bare-feet, toga, tail.
For the fuel choose fit matter,
Gun-stocks riddled by the rats;
Drums unbraced, old chakos that are
Now replaced by ALBERT hats.
Heat the furnace well
With old matériel :
He who gave men their gruel,
Deserves such martial fuel !
The form that in this mould shall settle,
For double purpose rises high :
A trophy to a man of mettle,
A monument of wars gone by.
It speaks of one outworn in battle,
Shall speak of battle outworn too,
To times when infant tongues shall prattle
Of deeds that now their elders do.
As fit metal for the figure,
Take the guns that wild Assaye
Talavera, Torres Vedras,
Orthez, Waterloo heard play.
Swords that flesh'd themselves in slaughter,
On each battle-field of Spain;
Bay'nets that shed blood like water,
Rusted yet with gore of slain.
Bronze of him that 'gainst a nation,
Of Reform did block the way;
Lead, that to Emancipation,
Form'd itself like potter's clay.
And with these, the compound cleaning,
Mingle ingots pure of gold,
Honesty that speaks its meaning,
Nature, bigoted but bold.
O'er the heated furnace brimming,
See the mixture boil and seethe ;
Scum atop, and scoriae swimming,
Molten purity beneath.
What hard did erst appear,
Liquid as water here,
Soon from the Fire-god's holding
Runs, ductile, to the moulding.
And in the process is a lesson,
Late learnt, but learnt at length ;
That hardness may put softness' dress on,
Weakness the garb of strength.
For the Iron Duke,
That scorn'd to look
On a people's petitions—
How oft hath he shown
That to hold their own
Is not given to patricians,
Save by a kindly
Yielding—not blindly—
To the true and the good
Of the multitude.
Hard as the brass,
And as shameless, alas !
The statesman's brow may be ;
But there comes a day
When it melts away
Into flexibility.
For the World is the furnace, the metal Opinion,
The Scum is fear and doubt;
The force of fire is Truth's dominion,
And the Mould is the Pressure without.
A TALKING POTATO !
THE Head Pacificator of Ireland—MR. THOMAS STEELE–talked as
follows a few days since at Conciliation Hall.—
“The retiring of MR. Keogh affords me, ye men of Ireland, my countrymen, an
appropriate opportunity, not of making a speech on moral force and physical force doc-
trines; such a speech would be preposterous, after you have heard O'Connell himself,
as incontrovertibly the creator of the ethical moral force revolutionary system; as NEw-
Ton was the inventor of the ethereal system of flurions, an invention not unworthy of
one of the seraphic intelligences of Heaven; or as WATT was the inventor of the double-
acting steam-engine, with its “work divinely wrought”—that gorgeous piece of mecha-
mism “the parallel motion” (enthusiastic cheering). No (said the speaker), I am only
about to call the attention, the steady, and earnest, and solemn attention of the associa-
tion—of this assembly in Conciliation Hall, and of the O'Connellites of Ireland, and
of the world, to a fact obvious to you all; but most important to be noted, and recol-
lected too (hear, hear). You all well know that during the absence of the father of his
country, and the father of John, his country's hope, it was my destiny,” &c.
Why does not O'Connell, as one not a bit “lower” than one “of the
seraphic intelligences of heaven” throw open, what is evidently now a
close-working patent 7 Or, as MR. BEARD grants licenses for Photo-
graphic wonders, why does not O'Connell suffer his own invention,
that of “ethical moral force” to be worked all over Ireland. The
touch about O'Connell being at once “the father of his country” and
“the father of John, his country's hope,” is not new. We have before
heard of one Boyle, who was “the father of chemistry and the brother
of the EARL of CoRK.”

IN consequence of the repeated blocking up of the principal London
thoroughfares, a plan has been proposed for opening two lines of com-
munication by means of strong lines of rope, capable of bearing the
weight of vehicles. So that by suspending the carriages, the incon-
venience of suspending the intercourse between different points will be
altogether avoided. It is evident that the only method of surmounting
the difficulties of transit which are being continually raised by paviors,

commissioners of sewers, and others, is by literally passing over them.
Stations for taking up and setting down might be opened at the various
| columns and steeples on the line of road, commencing with the Monu-
ment on Fish Street Hill, stopping at NELsoN's pillar for the passengers
to and from Charing Cross, continuing to the DUKE of York, and
concluding, while Piccadilly is in its present state of blockade, at one
of the arches of Hyde Park Corner.
PUNCH AND THE GOVERNMENT.
Asºº IT is not, perhaps, generally known
------ that we received a communication
| offering us the Government organship,
7 but the proposal sent to us turned out
to be a gross forgery. We have reason
to believe that the imposition was at-
tempted by the same unprincipled
and heartless persons who succeeded
in hoaxing Mrs. Harris and Mrs. Gamp,
when those unfortunate females were
exposed to ridicule by having listened
to the voice of the base deceiver. We
believe that poor Mrs. Harris was
taken in by placing too much reliance
on the confident assurances of her
grand maternal relative, the vene-
rable Mrs. Gamp, and the former has
frequently been heard singing to the
latter, in notes plaintive with femi-
nine feebleness, the following touching
stanzas, to the air of
WE MET.
Mrs. G. got very coarse,
And I rivall'd her coarseness;
We croak'd our joint abuse
Till we suffer'd from hoarseness.
We call'd all sorts of names,
Which recoil'd on each other :
Oh! thou hast been the cause
Of this failure, grand-mother.
We met !—’twas in Shoe Lane,
And I thought not she'd done me;
She came—I could not breathe,
For her leaders were on me.
She spoke –her words I took,
A little bit alter'd ;
We swore the Times was false,
But 'twas we who had falter'd.
We, however, who have none of the old-womanly softness of the
parties alluded to, were not deceived after the first glance at the com-
munication that had been sent to us, which we instantly detected to be
an audacious forgery. It offered to confer upon us the Government
Organship ; and, as an earnest of sincerity, we were presented with
the following outline of the intended contents of the Speech on the pro-
rogation of Parliament; which we print now, for the purpose of
shaming the unprincipled impostor who sent us an account so com-
pletely at variance with what actually occurred on the prorogation of
Parliament. It is fortunate for our character for sagacity, that we
kept the matter back until after we had been able to test its accuracy
by the actual result. We now give it, just as it reached us : —
“We may anticipate that the country in general, and newspaper
writers, reporters, &c. in particular, will be congratulated on the
breaking-up of Parliament. The Speech will then go on to say, that
HER MAJESTY is not sorry to have got rid of PEEL, who was becoming
rather impracticable, and that she hopes Russell, will prove more easy
to deal with. Satisfaction will then be expressed at the Report of the
Andover Committee; while indignation and astonishment will be
acknowledged at the Poor Law Commissioners not having resigned,
though a hope will be confidently added of their doing so at once, to
prevent the necessity for their expulsion. -
The miserable accommodation in Buckingham Palace will then be
feelingly dwelt upon, and a sum asked for Country excursions rendered
indispensable by the uncomfortable state of the royal residence.
The state of our relations with the East will then be deplored, and
the blockade of Fleet-street grievously lamented. Allusion will be
| made to treaties pending with the Paving Boards, and to the difficulty
of effecting an arrangement, on account of the number of parties
necessary to the treaty, in consequence of the hostile attitude of the
gas, the sewers, and the water-works.
The Wellington Statue will be slightly glanced at, and a doubt ex-
pressed as to the propriety of throwing such an onus on the British
public. - º
Thanks will be offered for the supplies, and great stress will be laid
on the value of liberal measures.
Attention will be called to the still unfinished state of the Nelson
Column, and a wish expressed that this lamentable affair could be
buried in oblivion, or anywhere else, that might admit of the burial of
such a huge grievance.
A paragraph will then be devoted to Westminster Bridge, and a hint
will be thrown out that this disgrace to the peerage ought not to be
º: any longer to interfere with the prospects of the British Par-
iament.”
Such was the pretended statement of the contents of the Speech
on the prorogation of Parliament.
An Itinerant Bishop.
IN the list of persons attending various public meetings in England,
we frequently find the name of the Bishop of JAMAICA. There is no
objection to this in itself, but we can't help wondering how Jamaica
can be getting on in the absence of its Bishop. While he is instilling
teetotalism and other virtues into the British public we very naturally
wonder what his Indian flock may be about, for it is proverbial that
the people of Jamaica are, commercially and familiarly speaking,
“rum customers.”

º
THE SNOBS OF ENGLAND.
BY ONE OF THEMSELVES.
CHAPTER XXVIII.-SOME CONTINENTAL SNOBS.
ow that September has come, and
all our parliamentary duties are
over, perhaps no class of Snobs are
in such high feather as the Conti-
mental Snobs. I watch these daily
as they commence their migrations
from the beach at Folkestone. I
see shoals of them depart (not per-
= haps without an innate longing too
to quit the island along with those
= happy Snobs). Farewell, dear
ºf friends, I say, you little know that
the individual who regards you
* from the beach is your friend and
3 historiographer and brother.
I went to-day to see our excellent
friend SNooks, on board the Queen
of the French ; many scores of Snobs were there, on the deck of that
fine ship, marching forth in their pride and bravery. They will be at
Ostend in four hours; they will inundate the continent next week;
they will carry into far lands the famous image of the British Snob.
I shall not see them—but am with them in spirit; and indeed there is
hardly a country in the known and civilized world in which these eyes
have not beheld them. -
I have seen Snobs, in pink coats and hunting boots, scouring over
the Campagna of Rome; and have heard their oaths and their well-
known slang in the galleries of the Vatican, and under the shadowy
arches of the Colosseum. I have met a Snob on a dromedary in the
desert, and picknicking under the pyramid of Cheops. I like to think
how many gallant British Snobs there are, at this minute of writing,
pushing their heads out of every window in the court-yard of MEURice's,
in the Rue de Rivoli ; or roaring out “Garsong, du pang,” “Garson,du
vang ; ” or swaggering down the Toledo at Naples ; or even how many
will be on the look out for SNooks on Ostend pier, for SNooks and
the rest of the Snobs on board the Queen of the French.
Look at the MARQUIs of CARABAs and his two carriages. My lady
Marchioness comes on board, looks round with that happy air of
mingled terror and impertinence which distinguishes her ladyship, and
rushes to her carriage, for it is impossible that she should mingle with
the other Snobs on deck. There she sits, and will be ill in private.
The strawberry-leaves on her chariot-panels are engraved on her
ladyship's heart. If she were going to heaven instead of to Ostend, I
rather think she would expect to have des places réserrées for her, and
would send to order the best rooms. A courier, with his money-bag
of office round his shoulders—a huge scowling footman, whose dark
pepper-and-salt livery glistens with the heraldic insignia of the CARA-
BAsses—a brazen-looking, tawdry French femme-de-chambre (none but
a female pen can do justice to that wonderful tawdry toilette of the
lady's-maid en royage)—and a miserable dame de Compagnie, are minis-
tering to the wants of her ladyship and her King Charles's spaniel.
They are rushing to and fro with Eau-de-Cologne, pocket-handker-
chiefs which are all fringe and cypher, and popping mysterious
cushions behind and before, and in every available corner of the
carriage.
The little Marquis, her husband, is walking about the deck in a
bewildered manner, with a lean daughter on each arm ; the carroty-
tufted hope of the family is already smoking on the fore-deck in a
travelling costume checked all over, and in little lacker-tipped jean
boots, and a shirt embroidered with pink boa-constrictors. What is
it that gives travelling Snobs such a marvellous propensity to rush
into a costume 2 Why should a man not travel in a coat, &c. 2 but
think proper to dress himself like a harlequin in mourning? See, even
young ALDERMANBURY, the tallow merchant, who has just stepped on
board, has got a travelling dress gaping all over with pockets; and
little Tom TAPEworm, the lawyer's clerk out of the City, who has
but three weeks' leave, turns out in gaiters and a bran new shooting-
jacket, and must let the moustachios grow on his little snuffy upper
lip, forsooth ! -
PoxiPEY Hicks is giving elaborate directions to his servant, and
asking loudly, “DAvis, where's the dwessing-case,” and “DAvis,
you'd best take the pistol-case into the cabin.” Little Pompey travels
AN- ~ ^
~ /**
---
with a dressing-case, and without any beard; whom he is going to
shoot with his pistols who on earth can tell ? and what he is to do
with his servant but wait upon him, I am at a loss to conjecture.
Look at honest NATHAN Houndsditch and his lady, and their little
son. What a noble air of blazing contentment illuminates the features
of those Snobs of Eastern race | What a toilette HoundsDITCH's is :
What rings and chains, what gold-headed canes and diamonds, what a
tuft the rogue has got to his chin (the rogue ! he will never spare
himself any cheap enjoyment 1) Little Hou Ndsditch has a little cane
with a gilt head and little mosaic ornaments—altogether an extra air.
As for the lady, she is all the colours of the rainbow : she has a pink
parasol, with a white lining, and a yellow bonnet, and an emerald
green shawl, and a shot silk pelisse; and drab boots and rhubarb-
coloured gloves; and party-coloured glass buttons, expanding from
the size of a fourpenny piece to a crown, glitter and twiddle all down
the front of her gorgeous costume. I have said before, I like to look
at “the Peoples” on their gala days, they are so picturesquely and
outrageously splendid and happy.
Yonder comes CAPTAIN BULL; spick and span, tight and trim, who
travels for four or six months every year of his life, who does not
commit himself by luxury of raiment or insolence of demeanour, but I
think is as great a Snob as any man on board. BULL passes the
season in London, sponging for dinners, and sleeping in a garret near
his Club. Abroad, he has been everywhere; he knows the best wine
at every inn in every capital in Europe; lives with the best English
company there ; has seen every palace and picture-gallery from
Madrid to Stockholm ; speaks an abominable little jargon of half-a-
dozen languages—and knows nothing. BULL hunts tufts on the
Continent, and is a sort of amateur courier. He will scrape acquain-
tance with old CARABAs before they make Ostend ; and will remind
his Lordship that he met him at Vienna twenty years ago, or gave
him a glass of Schnaps up the Righi. We have said BULL knows
nothing : he knows the birth, arms, and pedigree of all the peerage;
has poked his little eyes into every one of the carriages on board—
their panels noted and their crests surveyed ; he knows all the conti-
nental stories of English scandal—how Count Towrowski run off
with Miss BAggs at Naples—how cery thick LADY SMIGsMAG was
with young CornichoN of the French legation at Florence—the exact
amount which JACK DEUCEALL won of Bob GREENGoose at Baden—
what it is that made the STAGGs settle on the Continent—the sum
for which the O'GoggaRTY's estates are mortgaged, &c. If he can't
catch a lord he will hook on to a baronet, or else the old wretch will
catch hold of some beardless young stripling of fashion, and show him
“life” in various amiable and inaccessible quarters. Faugh the old
brute If he has every one of the vices of the most boisterous youth ;
at least, he is comforted by having no conscience. He is utterly
stupid, but of a jovial turn. He believes himself to be quite a
respectable member of society; but perhaps the only good action
he ever did in his life is the involuntary one of giving an example to
be avoided, and showing what an odious thing in the social picture is
that figure of the debauched old man who passes through life rather a
decorous SILENUs, and dies some day in his garret, alone, unrepenting,
and unnoted, save by his astonished heirs, who find that the dissolute
old miser has left money behind him. See he is up to old CARABAs
already ? I told you he would.
Yonder you see the old LADY MARY MACsCREw, and those middle-
aged young women, her daughters ; they are going to cheapen and
haggle in Belgium and up the Rhine until they meet with a boarding-
house where they can live upon less board-wages than her Ladyship
pays her footmen. But she will exact and receive considerable respect
from the British Snobs located in the watering-place which she selects
for her summer residence, being the daughter of the EARL of HAggis-
ToUN. That broad-shouldered buck, with the great whiskers and the
cleaned white-kid gloves, is MR. PHELIM CLANcy, of Poldoodystown;
he calls himself MR. DE CLANCY ; he endeavours to disguise his native
brogue with the richest superposition of English ; and if you play at
billiards or écarté with him, the chances are that you will win the
first game, and he the seven or eight games ensuing.
That over-grown lady with the four daughters, and the young
dandy from the University, her son, is MRs. Kewsy, the eminent
barrister's lady, who would die rather than not be in the fashion. She
has the Peerage in her carpet-bag, you may be sure ; but she is
altogether cut out by MRs. Quod, the attorney's wife, whose carriage,
with the apparatus of rumbles, dickeys, and imperials, scarcely yields
in splendour to the MARQUIs of CARABAs's own travelling chariot, and
whose courier has even bigger whiskers and a larger morocco money-
bag than the Marquis's own travelling gentleman. Remark her well ;
she is talking to MR. Spout, the new member for Jawborough, who is

going out to inspect the operations of the Zollverein, and will put some
very severe questions to Lond PALMERston next Session upon
England and her relations with the Prussian-blue trade, the Naples
soap trade, the German tinder trade, &c. Spout will patronize KING
Leopold at Brussels; will write letters from abroad to the Jaur-
borough Independent; and, in his quality of Momber du Parlimong
Britannique, will expect to be invited to a family dinner with every
sovereign whose dominions he honours with a visit during his tour.
The next person is but hark the bell for shore is ringing,
and, shaking Snooks's hand cordially, we rush on to the pier, waving
him a farewell as the noble black ship cuts keenly through the sunny
azure waters, bearing away that cargo of Snobs outward bound.

Debtor.
WE MUST INVADE IRELAND.
IRELAND was PEEL's difficulty: he said so. Ireland will be Rus-
sell's difficulty. She will be the difficulty of everybody who shall
attempt to govern her peaceably: she is becoming even a difficulty to
O'Connell ; thanks—small thanks—to MR. Smith O'Brien.
The fact is, as we have heard many respectable old gentlemen
declare, that Ireland is not yet conquered ; and conquered she must
be. We therefore plainly and plumply, without mincing the matter,
recommend an invasion of Ireland.
Not from the vain wish to parade our skill in strategy, but from
motives of the purest patriotism, do we propose the following arrange-
ment of the invading forces:—
The van is to consist of grenadiers, to be called the 1st Life Pota-
toes, who are to shower the effective missile they take their name from
on the quarters where it is most needed.
The right wing is to be formed of the Household Bread and Meat
Brigade ; troops that may be depended upon for giving the enemy a
bellyfull. They are to be instructed to give no quarter, except the
quartern loaf. The left shall be constituted by the Heavy (BARCLAY's)
Dragoons, who will have formed a junction with Guinness's regiment at
Dublin. These stout fellows will soon drench all their adversaries. In the
centre shall be stationed the Light Eatables and Drinkables. The old
Coercion Company is to be disbanded as useless, even as a forlorn hope.
The whole army is to be flanked by a squadron of Schoolmasters, who
are to form a corps de reserve, to act only when the victory is decided,
in order to complete and secure it. For, till the operations of the Pro-
visional Battalion have been successful, the services of the scholastic
force will be unavailing. The former, however, having broken the
enemy's line, his utter route and discomfiture by the latterisinevitable.

THE recent rumour on the subject of the importation of a hunting MR. J. T. LEADER surrounded by their deer, their roebucks, and their
establishment to Cannes by Iord BRough AM and MR. J. T. LEADER,
seems to have arisen in a somewhat curious manner. An old piece of
tapestry has turned up, in which two figures are shown of two most
extraordinary sportsmen, closely resembling an ex-chancellor and a
certain silent M.P. for Westminster. This remarkable piece of work
is so life-like in its effects, that any person seeing it would naturally
fall into the error of supposing that he looked upon the animated ori-
ginals of the picture.
The correspondent of a French paper, with a vividness of imagination
that belongs to all his countrymen, happening to look upon the tapes-
footmen in pea-green liveries. A reverie soon takes the shape of a
paragraph, and hence the letter in the French newspapers.
MR. LEADER has denied, in a letter to the Times, his share in the
sporting eccentricities attributed to him. LoRD BRough AM has hitherto
sent no contradiction, and if silence gives consent, we may perhaps
consider that his Lordship has really been importing deers, roebucks,
and pea-green liveried keepers, for the purpose of having a winter
campaign of deer-stalking.
The picture, whether right or wrong, is too good to be lost, and we
have, therefore, at a considerable expense, secured a copy of the tapestry,
try, (came to the conviction that he had seen Lord Brough AM and which we have the pleasure of presenting to the public.
THE QUEEN OF SPAIN'S MARRIAGE.

THE' hand of her Spanish Majesty is no longer in the matrimonial
market. It has been for years the subject of a great European raffle,
which has at length been decided in favour of one of her cousins. The
game has been kept up with spirit, and though there have been a good
many high throws in the course of the raffle, a lucky hit at the last
moment has consigned the prize to one who was little thought of at the
Allº
N
commencement of the lottery. Princes about to marry, or who thought
themselves about to marry, will be somewhat dissatisfied by the result,
and the KING of THE FRENCH, who paid rather heavily for chances for
two of his sons, may feel a little sore, though he professes to regard the
issue with favour. It is, at all events, some consolation to the QUEEN OF
SPAIN herself to be released from the importunities of so many suitors.

PUNCH, OR THE
111
LONDON CHARIVARI.
DR. SYNTAX TO MR. PUNCH.
ood Mr. Punch, the Public's friend,
To you this note I’m led to send,
In hopes it may, perchance, induce
Your notice of a great abuse.
You are aware, my friend grotesque,
How much I love the picturesque;
My last excursion in these islands
Was to the famous Scottish Highlands:
To Glen Lin-beg my way I bent,
Which leads to the magnificent
Scenery of the Cairngorm mountains,
Hard by the Dee's romantic fountains.
I reached the pass conducting to
This highly-celebrated view,
When lo, to my exceeding wrath,
A keeper did obstruct my path.
“My man,” quoth I, “explain, I pray,
Wherefore you thus arrest my way.”
Quoth he, “’Tis by the Duke's command,
Who rents this piece of sporting land,
Under my lord the EARL of FIFE.”
“This is unpleasant, on my life,”
Said I, “a disappointment keen
Here, all this weary way I've been,
And, now I've reach'd the wish'd-for spot,
To see it I am suffer'd not
“Hech l’” said the man, “I dinna ken,_
The Duke has bid us close the glen.”
“Friend,” I replied, “were you his Grace,
Thus much I'd tell you to your face—
He who the traveller denies
On Nature's charms to feast his eyes,
Behaves like some ungracious churl,
Not like a noble Duke or Earl.
Nor is it a sagacious aim
Thus strictly to preserve your game,
For thus the general indignation
You'll rouse against its preservation.”
So having said, I turn'd my back,
And homeward bent my weary track.
Doctor SYNTAx.
QIjt Queen at Guermäep.
THIs insignificant little island has been thrown into a state of loyal
excitement by the flying visit of Her Majesty. The Lieutenant-
Governor has been prancing about on horseback under the influence of
a species of mania, and with the evident impression that the eyes of
Europe, Asia, Africa, and America are upon himself and the handful
of people he presides over.
The QUEEN went to Guernsey, where she was hallooed at and cheered
as Royalty always is by those who are not accustomed to the sight of
it. In accordance with the usual practice, a written acknowledgment
of the compliment is sent from the Home Secretary, whose epistle puts
the Lieutenant-Governor into a state of frantic ecstasy; he assembles
the islanders on a piece of vacant ground, and gallops up, attended by
the whole of his militia staff—a cheap and efficient substitute for
regular soldiers; he there bursts out into some inflated trash about
Guernsey and the whole globe, which he follows up by saying that he
has received a letter which he wishes to read to the inhabitants. “At
first,” said he, “I intended to have made this communication by print-
ing the letter, but I thought that I would not allow any newspaper
editor to stand between the QUEEN and her people.”
We cannot see that the people get any nearer to the QUEEN because
the Lieutenant-Governor is the go-between instead of a journalist. :
We think the Guernsey press has a good action for libel against the
Lieutenant-Governor, who should be at least made to explain what he
means by his insinuation that the people would have been deceived by
a newspaper editor. The latter would not, at all events, have taken
the liberty of answering the communication as the Lieutenant-
Governor did, without consulting the inhabitants. He says he was
“in haste to save the post,” as if Her Majesty would not sleep easily,
until she knew that Guernsey felt the “gratification and pride” which
the Lieutenant-Governor enclosed in an envelope, and dropped at once
into the letter-box. He however promises, that, if any better acknow-
ledgment is prepared by any other hand, he will forward it. Any
superfluous Guernsey gratitude must therefore be directed to the QUEEN
—to the care of the Lieutenant-Governor.
While Guernsey has been honoured by royal notice, what must be
the feelings of Alderney and Sark at their exclusion from a share of
royal patronage. We fear that Alderney will feel itself terribly Cowed,
while Sark will almost sink into a premature Sarcophagus.
|it to say, they met.
ABSENTEES AWAKE.
“BETTER late than never.” At last the Irish absentees have awakened
to a sense of their duty. They have met in a body, for the purpose of
taking measures for the relief of their poor countrymen, threatened by
the impending potato-blight with starvation. We wish we were in
a condition to state the time and place of their meeting ; but suffice
The continent has been almost drained of its Irish
tourists, who came to England' to attend this concourse. A similar
desertion took place from the Moors and watering-places, from which,
*: than from their own estates, these gentlemen will henceforth be
absentees.
A noble Duke occupied the chair. We give no names; for the ab-
sentees, with a modesty more than national, desire that their bene-
volence should be unobtrusive. His Grace briefly stated the object of
the meeting, namely, now that the Irish were likely to lose their
potatoes, to endeavour to find them bread. Ireland no less than
England expected every man to do his duty. He would conclude
by moving that a subscription be forthwith raised for the purpose
of affording relief to the Irish population, and that every Irish land-
owner be earnestly requested to contribute to the same. For his own
part, he would say no more ; his acts should speak for him. (The
noble Lord here turned his pockets inside out, and having flung all the
| money in them, amounting to several hundred pounds, down upon the
table, resumed his seat amid loud applause.)
A Young Irishman could not restrain his feelings. They had been
told to subscribe. So they would. There had been a subscription—
but by whom ? Oh, shame 1 oh, disgrace to the proprietors of the
soil of Erin, it had been by the Sassenach ' Yes, and even now Britan-
nia was about to lend Hibernia money. The sum to be raised for this
purpose would amount, according to a calculation in the Times, to a
poll-tax of a shilling a head for every man, woman, and child. Bothe-
ration would they stand that ? He would say to the Sassenach, take
back your dirty shilling. It's ourselves that will relieve our own poor,
though we sell our shirt fronts off our shoulders to do that same.
He would move that no Sassenach be requested to join in the subscrip-
tion.
The motion was seconded by an Orangeman, who said that the object
of the meeting was one in which all parties should unite. He should
certainly be ashamed to borrow money from England if they could
possibly manage without it. But let them first try what they could de
of themselves. The experiment would be novel, but it might
succeed. While he had a sixpence—let alone some thousands a year—
his poor countrymen should not want. Might he be allowed to express
an opinion, which he had no doubt would be that of the meeting
generally. It was this, that so soon as a sufficiency had been raised
for their immediate object it was the bounden duty of all present, as
well as of some absent, to ship themselves as quickly as possible for
their own estates, and—stay there.
RAILWAY MEMBERS.
As Railways are becoming the “Fifth Estate,” it is time they should
be represented in Parliament, more especially as it is an estate which
covers more land than all the other estates put together. We propose,
therefore, that members should be returned to look after the interests
of railways. Each railway should return two or four members, accord-
ing to the length it runs, but branch lines should only return one
member. Each shareholder should have a vote. Thus we should have
the Honorable Member for the Grand Junction, moving for a return
of the passengers on the Eastern Counties Railway, who arrived safe
during the last year; and the Railway King would be able to answer
the accusations of rival companies, who are always throwing stones on
his favourite line, with a view, we suppose, of making the engines
trip up.
W. a busy scene, too, an election on a railway would be We can
fancy the express trains that would be engaged all day in conveying
the voters of each candidate. The excitement, too, as the state of the
poll was declared at each station, would be immense, whilst the scene
of chairing the member, on a special engine, the whole length of the
line, would be witnessed, in many cases, by half-a-dozen counties. . The
great booth might be erected at the Terminus, and each voter should
be called upon to produce his scrip, so as to guard against the polling
of Stags.
The placards, also, would be very rich. We should have “Vote for
SNooks and a large dividend" — “FitzJAMEs, the Stoker's True
Friend”—“BRows, and Early Trains”—“Plumpers for PACKstone,
the Pet of the North Midland’s.” We think a Railway Parliament will
soon be added to St. Stephen's ; in fact, the accidents and abuses are
so numerous that they absolutely require some engine in the House
of Commons to answer for them.

JUDGING from the tone and character of certain speeches delivered
at some of the late meetings of the World's Temperance Convention.
we should almost imagine it was an object with the teetotalers to show
how tipsy it is possible to get upon water. This consideration suggests
to us a proposal for the improvement of temperance “demonstrations.”
Already teetotalism has its processions. Its votaries occasionally en-
tertain the boys by marching in a body along the streets, with drums
beating, colours flying, and other manifestations of jollity not usually
evinced by people in their sober senses. No doubt these processions
were originally instituted in emulation of the displays made in ancient
Greece in honour of the God of Wine. They are obviously intended to
let the public see how bacchanalian men can be without Bacchus. Tee-
totallers, of course, would be the last persons to make pigs of themselves;
still, in this particular, they might as well go the entire animal. Nicho-
LAS PoussiN, at the National Gallery, will be happy to afford them
ORGIES FOR TEETOTALERS.

designs, which they might study to this end. The pink fleshings and
imitation-leopard skins of the street conjurors will enable them to
render those pictures in tableaux rivans; and goat-skin trowsers will
complete the illusion. Hampstead Heath would furnish them with a
donkey, on which the Temperance SILENUs could ride, or the shoulders
of some over-zealous orator among them would serve equivalently.
Punch would lend them his own, Pandean pipes, and they might
hire cymbals from the booth of Richardson. To this music, in
fantastic mazes, they might trip it along the thoroughfares, bearing
pitchers and hand-basons of their favourite beverage, and crowned—
not with ivy and vine-leaves, but with bulrushes, water-cresses, and
other aquatic verdure. And the numerous pumps which adorn the
metropolis would mark so many stations, at each of which they might
caper round the hydraulic engine, as the Bacchanals used to dance
round the image of their tutelar deity.

THE FLEET STREET PAVEMENT.
AFTER all that has been said about this wonderful granite, that was
to brave, for five and-twenty years, the waggon and the cab, it has
been found necessary to tear up a portion of it in consequence of its
sinking condition. The Woes and Gee-Wo's of Fleet Street are really
sufficient to melt a heart of stone; for no sooner is the pavement
allowed to rest on its bed, than its repose is violated by the rude hand
of the paviour. The efforts of the shop-keepers to attract attention to
their wares from the few passengers who still, from old associations,
haunt the street, are getting positively frantic. The keeper of a shop
of war.
opposite St. Dunstan's Church has actually turned a selection of small
articles smack into the street, on the chance of some of them being
picked up by a straggler who may have the honesty to walk in and pay
for them. Others have shut up their establishments altogether, and
emigrated to the coast, probably with the intention of quitting their
native land for ever.
PUNCH'S POLITICAL DICTIONARY.
MIDsh.IPMAN.—The highest class of petty officers on board a ship
Their duty is to communicate the captain's orders to the
men, so that the posts they occupy are very much the same as the
posts of the electric telegraph.
Militia.-A body of men who cannot be ordered out of the country,
and who may therefore be distinguished as soldiers for home consump-
tion.
MonBY-The medium of exchange by which you ascertain the
Value of commodities, except when you give more money for them than
they are worth, when you may ascertain the value of the money itself,
and the worthlessness of the commodity. Labour is said to be money,
but those who have most of the former usually get the least of the
latter, a point we leave to be settled by political economists. Money
is made of three metals; gold, silver, and copper ; to which brass may
perhaps be added, for brass may be often turned into cash very
effectually. It is said that money makes the man, but, in order to
realise this proverb, the man must first make the money.
The Royal Marines:
We have received a spirit-stirring appeal to our “better judgment”—
a court which is never sitting by the bye, for, like certain tea-dealers,
we have “none but the very best”—on the subject of the definition of a
MARINE in our Political Dictionary. We are presented with a catalogue
of the achievements of this gallant body, which seem to include the
taking of a place or two. As to the takings, we can only say that the
most valorous taking we were ever present at on the part of a marine,
was the taking of one of Dover's powders.
The gallant fellow, who looked as if he had never smelt powder
before, made one bold effort, and all was over. We ought, perhaps, in
justice to the marines, to have given this little anecdote earlier, but it
is never too late to repair an error.

Old Lady.—“AH ! I was just such another when I was HER Age.”
YOUNG IRELAND’S PARLIAMENT—1860.
A REPORT BY ANTICIPATION.
APRIL 1.-On the order of the day for going into a committee of
supply,–
MR. SHANAHAN took that opportunity of ascertaining the sense of
the House as to whether the resort to physical force against the
Sassenach was justifiable.
MR. O'FLAHERTY, with rhifference to that topic, wished to know if
the hon. gentleman opposite (MR. FLYNN) had, at a rhacent public
dhinner, dthrunk the “glorious, pious, and immortal mimory?”
MR. FLYNN might have proposed such a toast, or he might not. It
was no business of the hon. gentleman's at all, at all. (“Question!")
MR. O'FLAHERTY would assert that every Orangeman was a thraitor
to the cause of Ould Ireland. The Orange stain was a black blot on
the snowy mantle of green Erin. (Tremendous cheering, and cries of
“order?”)
MR. FlyNN did not come there to be insulted by a rapparee.
MR. O'FLAHERTY. Wasitrapparee? (Confusion, and calls of “Spakerſ")
MR. FLYNN belaved the jintleman knew where to find him.
The SPEAKER rose to order. The hon. Member who spoke last was
bound to afford satisfaction—botheration, no ; it was explanation he
meant.
A Member suggested that the Spaker do lave the chair. (Great
uproar.)
- * SPEAKER would like to see the boy that would make him stir an
inch.
A violent personal altercation here took place, in which several
leading members participated. The volubility, however, of their
utterance, and the fact that many of them expressed themselves in
their native tongue, prevents us from reporting it in detail. It termi-
nated in a general interchange of cards. At its conclusion,
The order of the day having been again proposed,
MR. O'Rourke moved, as an amendment, a Bill for the suppression
of the “godless colleges.”
* this question ensued a long and violent dispute, at the end of
which
The gallery was ordered to be cleared for a scuffle. On our return
The Speaker occupied the floor of the House, with a large majority
of members prostrate upon it round him; and black eyes ultimately
were voted the order of the day.
The Prince and the People.
DURING the recent short visit of the QUEEN to Guernsey it was
remarked that PRINCE ALBERT, with a nice spirit of consideration
towards the feelings of the inhabitants, wore a Guernsey shirt in the
morning. We understand that his Royal Highness, in the event of his
Paying a visit to Wales, will appear in a Welsh wig on all public
of music would be preferred.”
A LIBERAL OFFER.
THE following Advertisement emanates, no doubt, from some
quarter where it is proposed that young ladies shall receive “a liberal
education : ”—
WANº. in a Ladies' School a short distance from Town, a Lady, as
ENGLISH ASSISTANT, and who can superintend the French in the absence of
the master. One who has a knowledge of music preferred. A comfortable home, with
£1 per quarter allowed for washing, to be deemed sufficient. Address, &c, &c.
Things of this kind speak so strongly for themselves that their effect
is only weakened by comment. One may perceive how the person
drawing up this advertisement got more exacting as it went on, requir-
|ing at every fresh line some fresh service or accomplishment from the
victim who isoffered “a comfortable home, with a pound per quarter for
washing”—a summot enough for comfort, and scarcely sufficient for
cleanliness. “Mark the mean subterfuge”—as the rival puffers say
of one another—in commencing by asking for a lady as “an English
Assistant,” who, it is then insidiously stated, must be able to “super-
intend the French in the absence of the master | * As if this were not
enough labour to undertake for “a comfortable home” without salary.
|By the bye, how can a person be comfortable without the means of
buying clothes It is darkly hinted that “one who has a knowledge
We know the meaning of this amiable
preference. It suggests the infliction of a quantity of musical pupils
on the unfortunate victim, who, though ostensibly advertised for as an
English Assistant, will find herself forced into the triple character of
French Mistress, Music Mistress, and general Teacher in the establish-
ment 1
There is a maternal and philanthropic line in the humbug about “a
comfortable home;” but we know the sort of thing which is supposed
to constitute a comfortable home in schools where a pound a quarter
is thought a sufficient remuneration to a lady performing various duties
demanding a combination of accomplishments. Weak tea, stale bread,
bad butter, cheap meat, with short allowance of everything but over
bearing insolence, will be found to be the elements of most of “the com-
fortable homes” that are thus advertised.
GET OFF THE GRASS 1
How sweet, 'mid Windsor's scenery fair,
It is to take a breath of air;
To gaze upon the forest trees,
Whilst we inhale the healthful breeze ;
To feast the eye, with deep delight,
Upon the Castle's massive height !
As thus our minds we entertain,
Roaming amid the Royal domain,
What accents greet our ears 7–Alas !
“Get off the Grass : Get off the Grass 1”
The traveller, when his steps have stray'd
To view thy cottage, ADELAIDE,
If from the gravel pathway hard
He turn to tread the verdant sward,
In comfort to enjoy his view,
Or muse beneath the Avenue,
Entranced in pleasant thinkings, while
His careworn heart he would beguile,
What bids his happy dream to pass 2–
“Get off the Grass I Get off the Grass 1"
- When loyalty his bosom fires,
As, whilst the prospect he admires,
He sympathises with the bliss
Of her, the mistress of all this,
The Lady of the fair domain ;)
And, wishing her a happy reign,
Cries, as he views the fairy scene,
Within himself, “Long live the QUEEN "
Whilst thus he prays, he hears, alas !—
“Get off the Grass I Get off the Grass 1"
A NATURAL ERROR.
Richmond, in Surrey, has often been confounded with Richmond, in
Yorkshire. Now that a Richmond Railway has been established, it is
probable that this mistake will be made more frequently than ever—if
occasions.
--
the journey to London is to continue to occupy two hours.

THIS poor and dilapidated old pile has at length become reduced to
that state of existence which makes it miserable to itself and useless to
others. It is to be hoped that the rubbish-carters will not be long in
putting it out of its agony. The poor old thing is a heavy burden upon
Father Thames, who can stand it no longer, and is naturally indignant
at having those to whom he has always furnished a bed, coming down
upon him at last, when they can no longer keep their heads above
water.
The mere doctors' bills for Westminster Bridge have been something
awful during the last few years. Half the money expended in trying
to keep it up with artificial strength would have supported the whole
family of metropolitan bridges in respectability, and even in affluence.
To add to the inconvenience occasioned by the wretched state of the
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Bridge, it is now found impossible to go under it, except through one
arch, and the result is that the Thames navy is kept in a con-
tinual struggle for a passage through the solitary thoroughfare. Sea-
manship is certainly sharpened, but life is unfortunately jeopardised,
by this pushing for precedence through the only arch that is left open
to our Metropolitan fleet by the hopeless condition of the Bridge at
Westminster. The Lightning frequently falls foul of the fragile Pink,
and the thunder-struck Bride runs abaft the binnacle of the agitated
Bachelor. Such a state of things is no less detrimental to the tempers
of the captain and crew than to the security of the passengers.
“Down, down, derry down,” must be the burden of the seaman's—we
mean the Chel-sea-man's –song as he passes near the Bridge of
Westminster.
PUNCH ON THE INCREASE OF FARES
BY THE SOUTH-EASTERN RAILWAY.
SHow me the Company that dares,
When Parliament has ceased to sit,
To go at once and raise its fares;
I'll not believe it—not a bit.
But what is this before mine eyes?
'Tis the South-Eastern's monthly bill;
This is, indeed, a fearful rise—
Through all my veins there runs a chill.
To Ramsgate, eighteen shillings : pooh
. ...The charge is very near a pound;
If this is not a fearful do,
No do can in the world be found.
Six shillings is the price by steam,
Five only in the cabin fore ;
This surely must be all a dream—
The rail can't cost twelve shillings more.
In time perchance the saving's found 7
No—vainly such a thought beguiles;
The railway takes you round and round,
Out of your way some thirty miles.
P'rhaps they're as certain as the sun–
For punctuality you pay ?
No—scarce a single train they run
Arrives within the time they say.
What is the meaning of the rise ?
I'm sure I cannot tell—can you ?
Yes, Fame with hundred tongues replies,
“'Tis, in one word, A Do! A Do!”
PUBLIC STUPIDITY.
No one but an Editor having access to the correspondence sent to a
work of extensive circulation can have any notion of the extent to
which public stupidity is carried. Among other specimens of this
quality, received within the last few days we may particularise a note
complaining of the MARQUIs of Noam ANBy, the new Ambassador to
Paris, for having put up at an hotel instead of going into decent private
lodgings in the French Capital. Our correspondent asks, “Is it not
shameful that our representative at the Tuileries should live at a mise-
rable auberge called the Hotel of the British Embassy 7”
Another correspondent deprecates the fuss that has been made about
the river Plate, and demands the names of the spoons that have been
making such a stir upon the subject.
The public will, we are sure, appreciate the amount of patience we
must be called upon to exercise under these annoying inflictions.

AMONG the diseases incidental to the City of London it is a wonder
that inquirers into the sanatory condition of the metropolis should have
entirely failed to notice Aneurism. Aneurism is a disease of an artery,
requiring, for its cure, that the artery should be taken up. A disease
of this kind is continually occurring in all the main arteries of London,
so that their being taken up and consequently all circulation through
them being impeded are matters of constant occurrence. The vessel
most frequently attacked is the main trunk of Fleet Street, and so
numerous are the operations upon it thus necessitated that, for all
practical purposes, it may be pronounced impermeable.
It is well known in Surgery that when an artery is obliterated the
circulation is carried on by collateral or anastomosing vessels; but
this, though a beautiful provision of nature, cannot occur without
great disturbance of the economy. Thus, when the Fleet Street artery
is obstructed, the circulation is maintained by the anastomosing
branches of Chancery or Fetter Lane; though, when Fleet Street is
tied up, it has to take a very circuitous route, proceeding from
Catherine Street, or some other ramification of the Strand, in a mean-
dering course through Drury Lane and its connections, to the great
channel of Holborn. The economy of the passenger is hence very
much disturbed, for this great extension or vagary of the circulation
necessitates a corresponding augmentation in the fare of cabs. Anasto-
mosing branches, too, enlarge in the body natural, but in the body
civic they do no such thing. When Fleet Street is tied, Chancery
Lane becomes no wider, which is a manifest inconvenience. An
alarming confusion and disturbance are thus produced in the circula-
tion, always attended with danger—sometimes with loss of life.

-T--
THE SNOBS OF ENGLAND.
CHAPTER XXIX.-CONTINENTAL SNOBBERY CONTINUED.
WE are accustomed to laugh at the French for their braggadocio-
propensities, and intolerable vanity about la France, la Gloire, l'Em-
pereur, and the like; and yet I think in my heart that the British
Snob, for conceit and self-sufficiency and braggartism in his way, is
without a parallel. There is always something uneasy in a French-
man's conceit. He brags with so much fury, shrieking, and gesticu-
lation ; yells out so loudly that the Français is at the head of
civilization, the centre of thought, &c.; that one can't but see the
poor fellow has a lurking doubt in his own mind that he is not the
wonder he professes to be.
About the British Snob, on the contrary, there is commonly no
noise, no bluster, but the calmness of profound conviction. We are
better than all the world; we don't question the opinion at all ; it’s
an axiom. And when a Frenchman bellows out, “La France, Monsieur,
la France est à la tête du monde civilisé!” we laugh good-naturedly at
the frantic poor devil. We are the first chop of the world : we know
the fact so well in our secret hearts, that a claim set up elsewhere is
simply ludicrous. My dear brother reader, say, as a man of honour,
if you are not of this opinion ? Do you think a Frenchman your equal?
You don't—you gallant British Snob—you know you don't : no more,
perhaps, does the Snob your humble Servant, brother.
And I am inclined to think it is this conviction, and the consequent
bearing of the Englishman towards the foreigner whom he condescends
to visit, this confidence of superiority which holds up the head of the
owner of every English hat-box from Sicily to St. Petersburg, that
makes us so magnificently hated throughout Europe as we are ; this
—more than all our little victories, and of which many Frenchmen and
Spaniards have never heard—this amazing and indomitable insular
pride, which animates my lord in his travelling-carriage as well as
John in the rumble.
If you read the old Chronicles of the French wars, you find precisely
the same character of the Englishman, and HENRY V.'s people with
just the cool domineering manner of our own gallant veterans of France
and the Peninsula. Did you never hear ColoneL CUTLER and MAJoR
SLASHER talking over the war after dinner ? or CAPTAIN BoARDER
describing his action with the Indomptable 2 “Hang the fellows,”
says BoARDER, “their practice was very good. I was beat off three
times before I took her.” “Cuss those carabineers of Milhauds,” says
SLAsHER, “what work they made of our light cavalry !” implying a
sort of surprise that the Frenchmen should stand up against Britons
at all ; a good-natured wonder that the blind, mad, vain-glorious,
brave, poor devils, should actually have the courage to resist an
Englishman. Legions of such Englishmen are patronising Europe at
this moment, being kind to the Pope, or good-natured to the KING of
Holland, or condescending to inspect the Prussian reviews. When
Nicholas came here, who reviews a quarter of a million of pairs of
moustachios to his breakfast every morning, we took him off to
Windsor and showed him two whole regiments of six or eight hundred
Britons a-piece, with an air as much as to say,+*There, my boy, look

wiggins. At Boulogne.
at that. Those are Englishmen, those are, and your master whenever
you please,” as the nursery song says. The British Snob is long, long
past scepticism, and can afford to laugh quite good-humouredly at
those conceited Yankees, or besotted little Frenchmen, who set up as
models of mankind. They forsooth !
I have been led into these remarks by listening to an old fellow at
the Hotel du Nord, at Boulogne, and who is evidently of the SLAsHER
sort. He came down and seated himself at the breakfast-table, with a
surly scowl on his salmon-coloured blood-shot face, strangling in a
tight, cross-barred cravat; his linen and his appointments so perfectly
stiff and spotless that everybody at once recognised him as a dear
countryman. Only our port-wine and other admirable institutions
could have produced a figure so insolent, so stupid, so gentlemanlike.
After a while our attention was called to him by his roaring out, in a
voice of plethoric fury, “O !” -
Everybody turned round at the O, conceiving the Colonel to be, as
his countenance denoted him, in intense pain; but the waiters knew
better, and instead of being alarmed, brought the Colonel the kettle.
O, it appears, is the French for hot-water. The Colonel (though he
despises it heartily) thinks he speaks the language remarkably well.
Whilst he was inhausting his smoking tea, which went rolling and
gurgling down his throat, and hissing over the “hot coppers” of that
respectable veteran, a friend joined him, with a wizened face and very
black wig, evidently a Colonel too.
The two warriors, waggling their old heads at each other, presently
joined breakfast, and fell into conversation, and we had the advantage
of hearing about the old war, and some pleasant conjectures as to the
next, which they considered imminent. They psha'd the French fleet;
they poohpooh'd the French Commercial Marine; they showed how,
in a war, there would be a cordon (a cordong, by—) of steamers along
our coast, and by—, ready at a minute to land anywhere on the other
shore, to give the French as good a thrashing as they got in the last
war, by—. In fact a rumbling cannonade of oaths was fired by
the two veterans during the whole of their conversation.
There was a Frenchman in the room, but as he had not been above
ten years in London, of course he did not speak the language, and lost
the benefit of the conversation. “But oh, my country !” says I to
myself, “it’s no wonder that you are so beloved ' If I were a
Frenchman, how I would hate you!”
That brutal ignorant peevish bully of an Englishman is showing
himself in every city of Europe. One of the dullest creatures under
Heaven, he goes trampling Europe under foot, shouldering his way
into galleries and cathedrals, and bustling into palaces with his buck-
ram uniform. At church or theatre, gala or picture-gallery, his face
never varies. A thousand delightful sights pass before his bloodshot
eyes, and don't affect him. Countless brilliant scenes of life and
manners are shown him, but never move him. He goes to church, and
calls the practices there degrading and superstitious, as if his altar
was the only one that was acceptable. He goes to picture-galleries,
and is more ignorant about art than a French shoeblack. Art,
Nature pass, and there is no dot of admiration in his stupid eyes;
nothing moves him, except when a very great man comes his way,
and then the rigid proud self-confident inflexible British Snob can be
as humble as a flunky, and as supple as a harlequin.

CURIOSITIES OF MEDICAL EXPERIENCE.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVA
RI.
=~-
TALES FOR THE MARINES.
MEASUREs, it appears, are now in progress for the education of the
army generally. There is, however, one department of our military
service for whose instruction no provision has been made. Punch
alludes to that gallant corps, the Marines. He has, therefore, under-
taken the office of their instructor; and he proposes to impart to them
information in the mode wherein they are proverbially so susceptible
of it : that of narrative. The stories which he intends for their par-
ticular edification will not, he trusts, be uninteresting to the public
generally ; although each of these tales will be of so peculiar a nature
as especially to merit the nautical recommendation,-"Tell that to the
Marines.”
TALE THE FIRST.
A thing has just been done by the right reverend bench, which has
enriched the mitre with a jewel whereunto the diamond is paste, and
has imparted a whiteness to the lawn sleeves in comparison wherewith
driven snow is lamp-black.
The death of the late REv. M.R. KAYE, of St. Pancras, raving mad, in
penury and destitution, will be still fresh in the recollection of our
readers. They will also remember that on the inquiry into the cir-
cumstances attendant on the decease of that unfortunate gentleman,
the fact transpired, that there are in the metropolis numbers of poor
clergymen, dependent, as he was, for their subsistence, solely on such
professional employment as they can pick up ; that, in fact, they get
their living by hiring themselves out, on occasion, to do duty for their
more fortunate brethren ; and that, like labourers and mechanics who
support themselves by casual journey-work, they are called, “odd men.”
To our infinite gratification we understand that no sooner were these
revelations made public, than a meeting of the episcopal body took
place for the purpose of taking instant measures to abolish a state of
things so exceedingly scandalous to the Church. The following, we are
informed, is an outline of the proceedings which occurred thereat :—
The ARCHBishop of CANTERBURY, who was in the Chair, rose

under feelings of the deepest humiliation and sorrow. He had been
inexpressibly shocked by the disclosures which had been elicited in
consequence of the death of the REv. M.R. KAYE. That destitution
should exist among any class of men, was a disgrace to a country that
was rich and at the same time Christian. But that it should exist
|among the clergy of a Christian Church—and that a rich Church—for
he would own it was rich—was superlatively shameful. He shuddered,

The Bishop of ExETER did not usually interfere in matters uncon-
nected with his own diocese. The present question, however, concerned
every prelate of the Church. Neither himself nor his Right Reverend
brethren were rolling in wealth—far from it; though an impression
that they were had unfortunately got abroad. Still, he trusted that
he might, with a little self-denial, possibly manage to subsist on one
half of his present income. He would venture—not too precipitately,
he hoped—to say as much for his mitred brethren. Well, then, he
would throw down the other half of his episcopal revenue as a contri-
bution to a fund for supporting the unbeneficed clergy. They had
| heard of sending round the hat in cases of distress; now let them send
| round the mitre. There was his, with his subscription in it, to the
amount which he had stated he would be good for.
Hereupon the whole bench of Bishops simultaneously arose, and
| expressed their assent to the proposition of the Right Reverend Prelate,
which was carried by as loud acclamation as was consistent with epis-
copal dignity. It was further resolved, that a subscription list, in aid
of the object of the meeting, should be circulated among the wealthier
| clergy. This, we are assured, has been done, and many have subscribed
to the relief fund for indigent ministers, who never before subscribed to
anything except the Thirty-nine Articles.
This is the first story that Punch has to tell—to the Marines.

SALE of THE STUD OF LORD GEORGE BENTINCK.
AMoNG the various Lots that were knocked down, the following were
not included, although put up for what they would fetch :-
Claptrap.–A good hack, warranted to suit a country gentleman.
Sophistry.-Has been worked the whole of last session.
British Lion.—A capital Nag for a canter.
Statistics.-Unsound, but safe for a temporary purpose.
Vituperation.—A tried horse, though rather vicious ; backed by MR.
B. DISRAELI.
The Derby Dilly, or Forlorn Hope.—Entered for the Ministerial Cup
at the next St. Stephen's.
It is unfortunate that the noble Lord could not dispose of this portion
of his stud. Had he got rid of these horses, the political arena, for
which he seems to have exchanged the race-course, would be a specu-
lation more promising than it seems to be at present.
REMOTE NOTIONS OF ROYALTY.
ON the occasion of HER MAJESTY's visit to Jersey, several of the
poor people, who had never seen a live Queen before, openly expressed
their disappointment. They had expected to see HER MAJESTY
arrive in her coronation robes, with the sceptre in one hand and the
ball in the other, just as they had always seen her represented in the
engravings. They could not believe that a Queen would wear a white
chip bonnet, or that HER MAJESTY ever wore anything in her life but
crimson and ermine. Many of them really believed they had offended
HER MAJESTY, and that, to show her indignation, she had stopped on
board the Royal Yacht, and sent one of her maids on shore to represent
her. In the intensity of their loyalty they nearly cried about it.
PRINCE ALBERT fared no better. The people would not look upon a
white hat as an indication of royalty. One of the servants, perched up
in the dickey, passed the greater part of the day for His Royal High-
ness. He had a couple of big gold epaulettes on his shoulders, and a
staring red coat with a tremendous chest, and an enormous hat, which
may have accounted probably for the mistake.
We heard one of the natives, pointing to the Royal flunky, say with
great glee, “Oi chou la his weeskers a pour voyoi oukaree boy
kroikoi !” No one could tell us what the above meant; and as there is
no dictionary of the Jersey language published, we are sorry we cannot
translate it for the benefit of our readers. It must have been very
funny, for all the by-standers' laughed at it immensely ; so we give it
as a specimen of a joke in the Channel Islands. It was the only one
we heard during a week's sojourn.
THE WELLINGTON STATUE.
WE have just succeeded, through the agency of one of our most
sagacious scouts, in making a very curious discovery with respect to
this much-talked-of statue. The public may often have felt surprised
that the DUKE of WELLINGTON should remain passive and quiet under
the threatened indignity which seems to be in store for him. We have,
however, ascertained that an understanding has already been come to
with SIR F. TrENch, that, if the Statue should have an absurd effect,
the head of the illustrious Duke is to be removed from his bronze
shoulders, and that of SIR F. TRENCH will be substituted ; so that
SIR F. instead of F. M. will be the object of ridicule. Under this
promise the Duke has consented to await with patience the result of
the experiment.
It would have been impossible to have taken down the entire Statue
when it is once soldered together, but the exchange of heads is easily
made ; while.that of SIR F. TRENch, being exceedingly light, will be
lifted without difficulty. There could not be a better finish to the pile
than that which it will probably receive; and it is but fair that the
only man who has stuck up for the erection of the Statue should be
stuck up with it, and be called upon, in fact, to give it his countenance.
THE DERBY ELECTION.
MR. STRUTT–because a dissenter—has been pointed to as “a man of
no religion.” Now, Ste D1GBY MAckworth, his opponent, has been
lauded as the most pious of Parliamentary candidates. SIR DIGBY
arrived on a Saturday at Derby, and is praised for not “desecrating
the Sabbath by canvassing.” No : but SIR DIGBY (says the Patriot)
Went—
“Three times to church, and each time to a different church—the most splendid
example of electioneering piety, we readily confess, that ever came under our notice "
Really, if churches are to be made thus subservient to Parliamentary
purposes, we may soon expect to see Election papers pasted on the
tomb-stones.
Orders from Spain.
THE Times' Correspondent says:—
“So anxious were the French Government to see properly executed the order of the
Queen-Mother for the trousseaux of her Royal daughters, that a superior workman, con-
fined by illness in the hospital of La Pitié, had been carried home to work upon a casket
of rare beauty for the Infanta.”
And our own special informant adds—“So anxious is the paternal
heart of Louis-Philippe in the matter, that he has issued the Inost
stringent orders to the sick workman aforesaid not, under any circum-
stances soever, to dare to die until the job shall be accomplished.”
THE PRINCELY PET.
We perceive by the papers that the little DUKE of CoRNWALL
excited tremendous enthusiasm in his own little Duchy. What perhaps
added to the interest he excited among the inhabitants of this mining
district was the fact of the little fellow being himself a minor.

CHAPTER XI.
It was about a fortnight after the discovery of the turtle, that I fell
ill. Whether my illness arose from anxiety of mind—for celibacy
every day appeared more and more threatening—or whether from the
turtle itself, I never could determine. But ill I was—really ill. And
when confined to my hut by fever and ague—for I am sure I had
both—I had a terrible opportunity for lamenting the many times that
I thought I had had the vapours, and had acted accordingly: that is,
was sulky, feverish ; and would shut myself up in my room, and feed
myself on chicken broth, hartshorn, and romances. But now, I was
really ill; and felt the full sense of my former wickedness. In this
strait, my Emden groats were the best medicine for me ; and by force
of gruel—which, I am sure of it, is the noblest physic in the world,
especially for the female habit—I got better of my malady; but was
left in dreadful weakness. It was at this time, that, falling asleep, I
recollect I had a strange and curious dream, that much perplexed me.
I thought that I was sitting in a beautiful garden, in which there
were trees so high I could scarcely see their tops. And these trees, I
thought, inclined towards one another, making a sort of green aisle,
like the aisle of a church. And then suddenly I thought I saw a long
chain, made of wedding-rings, let down from the roof; and a young
man, with a beautiful red face, black hair and whiskers, that were a
fortune in themselves, came down the chain, hand over hand, and toe
over toe ; and when he was alighted on the ground, he came—with his
right hand spread over his bosom, and his figure gently inclined—
timidly towards me. Then he dropt upon his knee, and plucking a
ring from the chain, presented it to me; and then he took another—
and another—and another ; but I refused every one that was offered;
and the rest of the chain fell with a crash to the ground, and the young
man vanished; and the whole place was changed; and Ifound myself
in a stone cell of about six feet square, drest in white muslin, with a
skull in my hand, that my dreadful destiny made me continually kiss
and kiss, although the cold bone made my heart colder and colder with
every smack. And, at last, I thought the skull—though without eyes
—gave a sort of knowing, triumphant wink, and I screamed at the
impertinence—and screaming, awoke.
When I came a little to myself, I recollected with bitterness the
words of my dear father. Again and again he had assured
me that he would find me out a husband, “a steady, respectable
young man, and I could not divest my mind of the fancy that the
skull in my hand was the property of that much-wronged individual
Whoever he had been, he was, I thought, dead, and was very properly
sent to me in my dream to torment me. This vision continued for
some days to distract me ; but at length I became tranquillized ;
thanks to my native strength of mind, and the medicinal cordial I had
brought from the wreck.
It was about this time, that, casting my eyes about my hut, I saw
the fragment of a book that, among other things, I had brought from
the ship. There were only a few leaves complete and legible, the rats
and the salt-water having mutilated and stained them. And these few
leaves — strangely enough—contained the entire of the “Marriage
Service.” They were a great consolation to me. A thousand and a
thousand times did I read ; and—it may appear inconceivable—found
the matter impart to me a melancholy, but mysterious delight.
“Wilt thou have this man to thy wedded husband 7” I imagined
this melodious question most melodiously delivered ; and then—
having nothing else to do—I would imagine many specimens of
husbands, in many kinds of wedding-suits, with many different sorts
of smiling looks, standing one by one before me. And in this way,
in the very idleness of my heart, I would people my hut with a
hundred masculine shadows, waiting for me to pronounce the thrilling
—“I will.” There was hardly a gentleman of my former acquaintance
—of course I speak of the single and the widowed—that imagination
would not drag thousands of miles across the sea, and marry me to
in that hut. “Wilt thou have this man to 'thy wedded husband 7"
How often have I sunk to rest, with these words—mysteriously
uttered—breathing in my ears, and my lips mechanically.moving with
“I will l’”
“Who giveth this woman to be married to this man 2" Here was
another interrogation, thrilling the filial heart. How could I do other-
wise than behold my venerable father—with a dew-drop glistening in
either eye, and slightly coughing, to keep down emotion—how could I
fail to behold him—happy, yet flustered ; proud, but a little overcome
—stepping forth at the question, with the look of a man resolved upon
bestowing a priceless treasure upon a fellow-creature ? “Who giveth
this woman to be married to this man * *
Somehow these words continued to haunt me. I continually uttered
them, almost ignorant that I did so. When seemingly absorbed in
domestic occupations, my lips would breathe them. “Who giveth
this woman 2° And more ; after a time I set them to a sort of invol-
untary chant, and, whether waking or idle, would monotonously sing,
“Who giveth this woman 2" In this way does a master—if I ought
not rather to observe, a mistress—passion haunt us in solitude.
Of the effect of this I had a curious, and, for the time, a very start-
ling instance. When I got about again, I took a wider circuit of the
island than I had done before. First, however, I ought to state, that
I had made myself a complete suit of rabbit-skins. It went to my
heart to make them up with the fur inside—it was so much beauty
lost. But, as I had to protect myself against the briars and brambles
that, on every side, beset me in my walks, I had no remedy. And
then I had this saving consolation in my affliction—a consolation so
often sought for—nobody would know it ; nobody would see me. But
to return to my story. In the course of my rambles, I discovered that
a very beautiful sort of grape grew in the island. I at once resolved
to endeavour to make some real port and sherry. My mother's
currant wine was always sought far and wide; and though I had
never condescended to assist at the making of it, I nevertheless was
not altogether ignorant of the process. Besides, I could dry the grapes;
and if it was my destiny to pass Christmas in solitude, at least I
should not be without the consolation of something like a plum-
pudding.
Well, having made the discovery, I returned, carrying as many
bunches of grapes as I could bear ; and sat myself down, very much
fatigued, taking little notice of anything. Suddenly Iheard the words,
delivered in a sharp clear voice—“Who giveth this woman 7" I
trembled from head to foot; for I forgot that I possessed a parrot
(parrots abounded in the island), and I had domesticated a very young
one. The bird, instructed by my frequent lessons, unconsciously given,
had learnt the words ; and from that time, a day did not pass over
that the creature did not cry out—
“Who giveth this woman 2"
Curiosities of Sciences
At the sittings of the Association, at Southampton, it was announced
that a certain professor would produce the bottled smell of lightning,
we believe of the sort that the Americans call “greased.” If even the
smell of lightning can be bottled after this fashion, may we not hope
that thunderbolts shall be made so common that timid people may
fasten their bed-room doors with them *

MARGATE THEATRICALS.
THE dramatic prospects of Margate have this season materially
brightened, and the theatre has been restored to its legitimate use, after
doing duty as a broker's warehouse during the last two or three sum-
mers. The fortunes of the building fluctuate with the taste of the visi-
tors and the inhabitants. Sometimes it is an auction room, sometimes
a bazaar for painted tea-trays ; somatimes it is a literary institution ;
sometimes it is a wax-work exhibition ; sometimes it is a tea and coffee
house ; but this year it has become the sea-side asylum of the legiti-
mate drama.
A bill is now before usin which we find the following announcement:—
“On Thursday, a variety of entertainments, being by desire and under the Patronage
of the Captains, Officers, and Stewards of the Herne Bay Steam Packets.”
We are glad that these gallant fellows are going to patronise the
Margate theatre, and we have no doubt that CAPTAIN LARGE will
become “larger than ever,” like some gigantic gooseberry tarts we once
saw labelled with those words, in the window of a cheap pastrycook's.
We understand that a private box has been taken for the inhabitants
of Herne Bay on this occasion, and three places in the dress boxes for
the visitors, all of whom have promised to attend.
By the way, who are the “Captains, Officers, &c.” of a Herne Bay
steam boat 2 Is the stoker an officer ? or does the grade go no lower
than the brave Briton who rushes to the side of the boat with that great
thing like a porter's knot, technically called a fender, in the event of a
collision ? -
We are given to understand that the “Captains, Officers, and Stew-
ards,” will all attend the theatre in full uniform. CAPTAIN LARGE has
ordered four additional epaulettes, intending to wear one on each elbow
and two upon his breast, in addition to the ordinary pair upon the
shoulders. The man at the wheel has sent up to the Admiralty to
inquire what the regulation uniform will be in his case ; but the Stew-
ards have determined on adopting the costume of the unattached but-
lers, with the gold band of the Ancient Order of the Ale and Sandwich.

WARDS IN CHANCERY.
Miss MARY ANNE Johnson, of Hampstead, died last month, having
endowed—not a college, but a “dog and cats.” To her “black dog,
Carlo” she gives “an annuity of £30 a-year during the dog's life, to
be paid half-yearly.” And “unto each of the cats, Blacky, Jemmy, and
Tom, an annuity of £10 a-year for the three, cats, to be paid half-
yearly.” Since this will has been made known, Carlo—the fact shows
the spirit of trading competition—has been dreadfully annoyed by the
solicitations of a host of tripemen ; whilst Blacky, Jemmy, and Tom
have been equally persecuted by the commercial rapacity of cats'-meat
vendors and milkwomen. It is supposed that the heirs of Miss John-
son, not having yet arrived at the age of twenty-one, will—for the
protection of their property—be made wards in Chancery. LoRD
CoTTENHAM will be petitioned to give the run of his own Court to
Carlo ; whilst SIR LAUNCELoT SHAdwell may, it is hoped, be induced
to throw open his kitchen to Tom, Blacky, and Jemmy.

THE SPANISH MATCH.
• ALL the jewellers and goldsmiths of Paris are at work on ornaments
for the marriage of that poor little victim the QUEEN of SPAIN, doomed
to be executed to her cousin. The finery is spoken of, by competent
judges of such matters, as being very superb. The diamonds are said to
be as bright and almost as numerous as the tears shed by the bride, and
the gold trinkets almost as heavy as her sighs. Her hymeneal manacles,
though they may gall her to the bone, will at least be magnificently
chased.... No Hindoo widow was ever burned with greater splendour
than will attend the Spanish bride to the altar. She will be sacrificed
to marriage like a Queen. And when she has given her hand to her
cousin and promised to give her heart, the spirits of hypocrisy, and
guile, and fraud (especially invoked for the solemnity), will chant an
epithalamium expressly composed for the occasion by that great master
of domestic discord, the parent of all falsehood. An amnesty will, it is
said, be granted, and all political offences forgiven, on the marriage of
the Queen. Poor thing ! She herself may forgive her enemies, but, as
the Italian says, “it is not ordered that we should forgive our friends;”
and ISABELLA may bitterly remember that exception and privilege.
THE HALF-WAY HOUSE.
THIS last of the little Roadside Inns, which formerly dotted and
blotted the public thoroughfares, has at length been demolished. The
carts which once clustered round its littleportal, causing an obstruction
to the noisy traffic of a busy world, now pass the spot unrefreshed.
The driver misses his accustomed half-pint of porter, and the sagacious
horse looks in vain for the trough in which he was wont to dip his
mouth, while some friendly hand rubbed his nostrils with the salu-
brious hayband. These are reflections which afford inspiration to the
poet : so here we go into a sentimental ballad, once—twice—thrice—
and away.
No more upon the Western Road,
Beyond the little bridge of Knights—
Shall carters stop with heavy load
To taste of beer the strong delights.
No more shall waggons choke the way,
Just at the entrance into town ;
'Tis vanish'd, like a summer's day—
The Half-Way House is taken down.
No more shall the suburban gig
Pause for a glass of pleasant ale;
And ne'er again shall roadside pig
With deep-toned grunt the ear assail.
No more shall drivers, from their seats,
Upon each other fiercely frown;
There's room when one the other meets— .
The Half-Way House is taken down.
Alas, thou venerable pile !
Could they not leave thee to decay ?
Within a very little while
Thou wouldst have clear'd thyself away.
Why"should they force thee thus to go
In lots to Thomson, SMITH, or BRowN ?
I cannot say—I do but know
The Half-Way House is taken down.
Yankee Tactics.
The New York Herald says that “an American citizen can learn
military tactics in twenty-four hours, when occasion may require.”
Not a word about his learning to pay his debts, though those are tactics
which it is rather necessary a State, which talks so much about going
to war, should learn. If it takes a Philadelphian citizen four-and-
twenty hours to discharge a musket, we wonder how long it would
take him before he could discharge a bill 2

WHAT'S COME TO THE CLUBS?
“SIR,
“You have been making some observa-
tions about the stoppage of Fleet Street, which,
I dare say, are remarkably interesting to per-
sons engagedin that part of the town. It seems
to me you might just as well object because
the road up Mont Blanc was difficult, or there
was a stoppage in the streets of Timbuctoo.
Demrleet Street, Sir; in a word, who the deuce
cares about Fleet Street 2 What Icomplain of
is the shameful state of dilapidation in the
Christian end of the town.
“The stoppage in Piccadilly renders one of
my clubs impossible to me, and crams Mayfair
with thousands of the most unwholesome
vehicles, which, Ithink, will positively empester
theneighbourhood. A horrible omnibus nearly
écrasédmy Brougham, in Chapel Street, yester-
day; and when I remonstrated from the inte-
rior, the wretched driver and conducteur of the
public vehicle ripostěd with a vulgarity of
insolence which shook my nerves dangerously.
And the state of the clubs: what is that 2
What resource has a man-about-town but his
clubs, and what, Iask, are the clubs at present 2
“Yesterday Idrove to the Polyanthus, to see
if I could get a rubber before dinner; instead
of getting in I find—

a rude fellow on a ladder, with a pail barri-
cading the door, and the club shut for Septem-
ber. “Drive me to SNooks's, in St. James's

the door barricaded, two rude fellows with two
pails, and a quantity of painting-brushes and
*—and SNooks's shut up, as the Polyan-
thus.

and that, at last, is open. I enter and find—

that infernal bore, old SIR John Roarer, who
coughs, who snores, who expectorates, who has
the asthma, and reads the papers out loud—
the most insufferable nuisance in London, and
the only man left here.
“Have the goodness, Sir, on receipt of this,
to use what influence you have (1) to get the
Clubs open, (2) the barricades of Piccadilly
removed, and (3) to order SIR John RoaRER to
leave town, with something in your clever way

obliges me to be in London: but a DE Mo-

ſtars. Gamp in the IBismalg.
This dim old lady sent forth on Monday a
series of groans against the tendency of the
present age to cheerfulness. She is afraid that
the world is getting too good-humoured and
lively in spite of all her efforts —which we
must confess have been tremendous—to keep
it otherwise. Mrs. Gamp certainly knows her
own peculiar forte when she tries to rally round
her a dull party and make herself the organ
of the low-spirited portion of the population,
of those indeed who cannot see a joke, and
who may feel assured that they never will
stand a chance of seeing one as long as they
confine their reading to the Morning Herald.
The old lady complains bitterly of a ten-
dency to turn everything into fun. She has
been made fun of herself, poor soul, and this
is indeed the very extreme of comic alchemy,
for it is positively extracting mirth from the
dullest possible subject.
We can pity the misfortune of a morbidim-
agination which takes a dismal view of every-
thing; we can feel commiseration for our
grandmother who has perpetually “got the
vapours;” but we cannot pardon her for her
malice. She has given us a specimen of her
quality in that melancholy effusion which she
put forward as a leading article on Monday,
the 9th of September.
Poor grandmamma becomes ill-natured and
blasphemous when she suggests that “the exi-
gency of the times may demand and get a
Comic prayer-book.” This lamentable attempt
to be jocose proves the fearful want of dis-
crimination Mrs. Gamp labours under when
seeking a subject for her lugubrious merriment.
It would gratify Mrs.G. to point to anything in
which the comic writers, against whom she
is so angry, are concerned, where there has
been any tendency to the blasphemous style
of literature she has so clumsily suggested.
Mrs. Gamp has long been engaged in a
Quixotic crusade against wit and good-hu-
mour. She began the assault, and must by
this time have found that she has got the
worst of it. Our only surprise is that she
should feel hostility towards comic writing,
for the poet has told us that
* Gentle dullness ever loves a joke.”
DIRGE ON THE QUEEN'S HIGHWAY.
WELL-A-DAY! ah, well-a-day !
Whither hath gone the QUEEN’s Highway?
The ancient Pikes—oh, where are they
Chorus—Well-a-day ! &c.
The QUEEN’s Highway exists no more,
Its track the greensward mantles o'er; .
Thereon the donkeys graze, and cows,
And fleecy flocks the verdure browse.
The houses, too, along its course,
That entertain’d both man and horse,
Are quite done up ; the coach no more
Pulls up before the tavern-door.
What though no highwaymen assail
The travºller now, nor stop the Mail fi
“Stand and deliver !”.'s still the cry,
Fares are so villainously high.
One Royal road we scarce can boast;
Railways are everything—almost :
And o'er the Highways' broad domain,
Hudson usurps VicroRIA's reign.
Important to Duns and Debtors.
WE understand that Lond WILLIAM PAGET
is preparing a sort of Conversation Lexicon
for the use of Debtors and Creditors, showing
how the former ought to be addressed by the
latter. For the benefit of noblemen and gentle-
men who are in the habit of being pestered
with importunities from foreign tradesmen, a
quantity of oaths, translated into all the mo-
dern languages, will appear in an appendix to
the work.
NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.
His Royal HighNess THE PRINCE or WALEs
has been rated as midshipman on the ship's

naval precocity of His Royal Highness con-
tinue, it may be confidently expected, that, in
the year isso, he will have attained the
rank of Admiral of the Very Blue; when, in
the event of a war with France, he will take
the command of the English fleet against the
French admiral, PRINCE Joinville.
A * FRIENDLY HINT.”
THE first step on the road to eminence is
usually the publication of a book. As Lond
George BENTINck aspires to political distinc-
tion, we recommend this plan to his Lordship.
Under the above title we would advise him to
publish “the best book he ever made for the
Derby.” -

DURING the blocking up of the city thoroughfares, which promises
or rather threatens to be permanent, arrangements will, we understand,
be made for doing the city business west of Temple Bar, by opening
temporary offices on the—speaking West-end-ically—cis-portal side of
the metropolis. Booths will be erected in the large unused space from
St. Clement's church to Temple Bar, for the accommodation of the
Bank of England, the Royal Exchange, and other large establishments.

nience from the blockade being rendered complete instead of partial
The annexed engraving furnishes a representation of the proposed
plan, which will, no doubt, meet the approbation of the inhabitants and
visitors of the great metropolis.
- * THE BRITISH Association.
(From our own Correspondent.)
Though the balance-sheet of the Association gives the sums ex-
pended in various scientific pursuits, there is nothing to satisfy the
curiosity of the public as to the nature of the proceedings in which the
money has been exhausted. The charge for “Captive balloons” has
puzzled many subscribers to the Association, who are anxious to know
whether the charge of 8l. 19s. 3d, has been incurred in releasing
balloons that have got caught in chimney-pots, or in redeeming them
when they have been detained for damage done in descending upon
private property.
The Experiments on the Strength of Materials can be very easily
understood, and the imagination at once pictures SIR R. MURCHIsox
attempting to bend a poker, or DR. DAUBENY pulling up the collar of a
corazza shirt with tremendous energy, to test the strength of the
material.
The Researches on Atmospheric Waves have of course been conducted
during a boating party, and the extra three-pence charged for these
researches may be accounted for on the supposition that the savans
were liberal enough to “remember the Jack-in-the-water.”
A hundred pounds for fossil fishes in the London clay seems to be a
frightful charge. Billingsgate might be bought up any morning in the
week for half the money. -
It will be seen that PROFEssoR Edward Forbes, in the Zoology
Section, produced a number of live animals which he had captured on
the British coast. We are not aware of any live animals who frequent
the British coast, but the preventive men. One of these dressed up
a la What-is-it would have produced a wonderful effect on the Section,
if the Professor had only being seized with the heureuse pensée of
preparing such a spectacle for the gratification of the visitors.
In Section B, a very interesting paper was read on the expansion of
salts. It proved that a single ounce of genuine Epsom will flavour a
quart of water sufficiently for the use of schools, where it is advisable
to make a dose go as far as possible.
MR. E. R. J. KNowLEs read a paper on a singular appearance in
the flame of a candle. He made some curious calculations of the
number of thieves detected in this position, and proved they had
increased since the disappearance of snuffers had caused the abolition
of capital punishment as regards these “wicked” intruders. The
Section did not take the joke on the word “wick-ed,” much to the
annoyance of MR. KNowLEs, who declared he would never be witty
again at any of the Association's meetings.
PROFEssoR GRove and PROFEssoR PLAYFAIR got into an angry dis-
cussion on hot water. The former thought that heat would boil water
away; but the latter combated the suggestion. As we found the steam
getting up, we made the best of our way out of the Section.
In Section C. we found MR. JAMEs BUCKMAN on the Silurian beds,
at Bay head, but as we were on the point of being sent to sleep on
these beds, we quitted the Section with great precipitancy.
The Association has met with considerable politeness from the South
Western Railway, and has been allowed the use of the Bugle Hall at
the terminus. Some of the savans have been amusing themselves by
playing tunes upon the bugles l ... --

THE SNOBS OF ENGLAND.
BY ONE OF THEMSELVES.
CHAPTER XXX.-ENGLISH SNOBS ON THE CONTINENT.
HAT is the use of Lord Rosse's telescope 7” my
f friend PAN whiski exclaimed the other day.
iſ “It only enables you to see a few hundred
= thousands of miles farther. What were thought
= to be mere nebulae, turn out to be most perceiv-
== able starry systems ; and beyond these, you see
| other nebulae, which a more powerful glass will
A show to be stars, again; and so they go on
§ glittering and winking away into eternity.”
§ With which my friend PAN, heaving a great
Flº sigh, as if confessing his inability to look Infinity
in the face, sank back resigned, and swallowed
a large bumper of Claret.
– I (who, like other great men, have but one
: idea), thought to myself, that as the stars are,
so are the Snobs :—the more you gaze upon
those luminaries, the more you behold—now
nebulously congregated—now faintly distinguish-
able—now brightly defined—until they twinkle
off in endless blazes, and fade into the immeasur-
able darkness. I am but as a child playing on the
| sea-shore. Some telescopic philosopher will arise one day, some great
Snobonomer, to find the laws of the great science which we are now
merely playing with, and to define, and settle, and classify that which
is at present but vague theory, and loosc, though elegant assertion.
Yes : a single eye can but trace a very few and simple varieties of
the enormous universe of Snobs. I sometimes think of appealing to
the public, and calling together a 'congress of savans, such as met at
Southampton—each to bring his contributions and read his paper on
the Great Subject. For what can a single poor few do, even with
the subject at present in hand 2 English Snobs on the Continent—
though they are a hundred thousand times less numerous than on
their native island, yet even these few are too many. One can only
fix a stray one here and there. The individuals are caught—the
thousands escape. I have noted down but three whom I have met with
in my walk this morning through this pleasant marine city of Boulogne.
There is the English RAFF Snob, that frequents estaminets and
cabarets; who is heard yelling, “We won't go home till morning !”
and startling the midnight echoes of quiet continental towns with
shrieks of English slang. The boozy unshorn wretch is seen hovering
round quays as packets arrive, and tippling drams in inn bars where
he gets credit. He talks French with slang familiarity: he and
his like quite people the debt-prisons on the Continent. He plays
pool at the billiard-houses, and may be seen engaged at cards and
dominoes of forenoons. His signature is to be seen on countless bills
of exchange : it belonged to an honourable family once, very likely;
for the English RAFF most probably began by being a gentleman, and
has a father over the water who is ashamed to hear his name. He has
cheated the old “governor’’ repeatedly in better days, and swindled
his sisters of their portions, and robbed his younger brothers. Now
he is living on his wife's jointure : she is hidden away in some dismal
garret, patching shabby finery and cobbling up old clothes for her
children—the most miserable and slatternly of women.
Or sometimes the poor woman and her daughters go about timidly,
giving lessons in English and music, or do embroidery and work
under-hand, to purchase the means for the pot-au-feu; while RAFF is
swaggering on the quay, or tossing off glasses of Cognac at the Café.
The unfortunate creature has a child still every year, and her constant
hypocrisy is to try and make her girls believe that their father is a
respectable man, and to huddle him out of the way, when the brute
comes home drunk.
Those poor ruined souls get together and have a society of their
own, the which it is very affecting to watch—those tawdry pretences
at gentility, those flimsy attempts at gaiety : those woful sallies : that
jingling old piano; O, it makes the heart sick to see and hear them 1
As MRs. RAFF, with her company of pale daughters, gives a penny tea
to MRs. DIDDLER, and they talk about bygone times and the fine
society they kept ; and they sing feeble songs out of tattered old
music-books, and while engaged in this sort of entertainment, in comes
Has not everybody who has lived abroad met CAPTAIN RAFF 2 His
| name is proclaimed, every now and then, by Mr. Sheriff's OFFICER
many of his sort that I will lay a wager that I shall be accused of
gross personality for showing him up. Many a less irreclaimable vil-
lain is transported ; many a more honourable man is at present at the
treadmill ; and although we are the noblest, greatest, most religious,
and most moral people in the world, I would still like to know where,
except in the United Kingdom, debts are a matter of joke, and making
tradesmen “suffer” a sport that gentlemen own to ? It is dishonour-
able to owe money in France. You never heard people in other parts
of Europe brag of their swindling; or see a prison in a large conti-
nental town which is not more or less peopled with English rogues. A
A still more loathsome and dangerous Snob than the above transpa-
rent and passive scamp, is frequent on the continent of Europe, and
my young Snob friends who are travelling thither should be specially
warned against him. CAPTAIN LEGG is a gentleman, like RAFF, though
perhaps of a better degree. He has robbed his family too, but of a
great deal more, and has boldly dishonoured bills for thousands, where
RAFF has been boggling over the clumsy conveyance of a ten-pound
note. LEGG is always at the best inn, with the finest waistcoats and
moustachios, or tearing about in the flashest of britzkas, while poor
RAFF is tipsifying himself with spirits and smoking cheap tobacco.
It is amazing to think that LEGG, so often shown up, and known every
where, is flourishing yet. He would sink into utter ruin, but for the
constant and ardent love of gentility that distinguishes the English
| Snob. There is many a young fellow of the middle classes who must
| know LEGG to be a rogue and a cheat ; and yet, from his desire to be
in the fashion, and his admiration of tip-top swells, and from his ambi-
tion to air himself by the side of a Lord's son, will let LEGG, make an
income out of him ; content to pay, so long as he can enjoy that
society. Many a worthy father of a family, when he hears that his
son is riding about with CAPTAIN Legg, Lord LEvant's son, is rather
pleased that young Hopeful should be in such good company.
LEGG and his friend, MAJoR MACER, make professional tours through
Europe, and are to be found at the right places at the right time.
Last year I heard how my young acquaintance, MR. MUFF, from Oxford,
going to see a little life at a Carnival ball at Paris, was accosted by
an Englishman who did not know a word of the d
waiter with whom there was a dispute about refreshments.
quite a comfort, the stranger said, to see an honest English face ; and
did MUFF know where there was a good place for supper ? So those
two went to supper, and who should come in, of all men in the world,
but MAJOR MACER 2 And so LEGG introduced MACER, and so there
came on a little intimacy, and three-card loo, &c., &c. Year after year
scores of MUFFs, in various places in the world, are victimised by
LEGG and MACER. The story is so stale, the trick of seduction so
entirely old and clumsy, that it is only a wonder people can be taken
in any more ; but the temptations of vice and gentility together are
too much for young English Snobs, and those simple young victims
are caught fresh every day. Though it is only to be kicked and
cheated by men of fashion, your true British Snob will present himself
for the honour.
I need not allude here to that very common British Snob, who makes
desperate efforts at becoming intimate with the great continental
aristocracy, such as old Rolls, the baker, who has set up his quarters
in the Faubourg Saint Germain, and will receive none but Carlists,
and no French gentleman under the rank of a Marquis. We can all
of us laugh at that fellow's pretensions well enough—we who tremble
before a great man of our own nation. But, as you say, my brave
and honest John BULL of a Snob, a French Marquis of twenty descents
is very different from an English Peer ; and a pack of beggarly
German and Italian Fuersten and Principi awaken the scorn of an
honest-minded Briton. But our aristocracy—that's a very different
matter. They are the real leaders of the world—the real old original
and-no-mistake nobility. Off with your cap, Snob ; down on your
knees, Snob, and truckle.

A MILITARY band is to be embarked for Tahiti,

INTERESTING CLERICAL DISCOVERY.
WE understand that a singular discovery has been made by the
Dean and Chapter of Westminster, corroborated, in its main points,
by the corresponding dignitaries of St. Paul's, and of most other cathedral
churches in the kingdom. It has recently appeared that the opinion,
so long prevalent among statesmen and legislators, that the public, if
admitted to view works and monuments of Art gratis, would infallibly
mutilate and destroy them, is erroneous. Experiments on a large scale,
conducted at the British Museum, the National Gallery, Hampton
Court, and other institutions and places of interest, have abundantly
refuted this error in a general way. But the clerical gentlemen above
alluded to have found out that there are exceptions to the public's
otherwise uniform good conduct in this particular. They have satisfied
themselves that tombs, effigies, and mural tablets have a species of
attraction almost magnetic for pen-knives and walking-sticks.
Their researches, however, have furnished them with a remedy, con-
sidered by them to be of unfailing efficacy against the mischief to
which the million are thus prone. It consists in the extraction from
the pocket of each visitant to their collection—we beg pardon—to the
tombs in Westminster Abbey, of the small coin termed a sixpence. At
St. Paul's, it seems, twopence is found an adequate safeguard for the
body of the church; but the ascent of the sacred edifice requires an
ascending scale of protection. As the sixpences, and twopences, and
shillings of the million are millions of sixpences, and shillings, and two-
pences, the reverend philosophers above mentioned are no doubt reap-
ing a rich harvest from their discovery.
The Duke and the Dray-Horses.
MR. JEsse, the veracious historian of Dogs, has favoured us with
the following :—“A fact singularly illustrative of the sensibility of the
horse, has come to the writer's knowledge. MR. GoDING, the well-
known brewer, volunteered the services of forty dray-horses to drag
the WELLINGTON Statue from the foundry to the arch. All the
animals are so elated by the honour, that they have lost their stomachs,
and can scarcely swallow half their usual quantity of beans. Very
striking this,” says MR. Jesse. And Punch adds—“Very.”

ROYAL SEA-SICKNESS.
QUR friend, the ever-correct Observer (the organ specially patronised,
as it avouches, at Windsor Castle), has a very luminous article on the
“Royal Sea-sickness.” It says, very touchingly—
| “It has been stated that His Royal Highness suffered in this disagreeable respect to
a far greater extent than Her MAjesty; the fact being, that for only one day, when
the weather was very bad, was either of these royal personages sick. On this occasion
there was complete sympathy, each having endured an equal amount of discomfort, but
such as could be easily borne when it afforded the opportunity of witnessing so much
loyalty and devotion from all classes of HER MAJEsty's subjects.”
T. Thus, when man and wife are both sick, the happy result is “com-
plete sympathy.” When only one calls for “the steward,” the sym-
pathy must necessarily be imperfect. But how, we ask the Observer,
did “all classes” witness the royal indisposition ? We thought the
Royal Yacht was manned by sailors alone, and were not aware that
the vessel carried a sprinkling of all denominations of HER MAJEsty's
|subjects. Surely there is more than enough of this petty prying and
meddling with the domesticity of the sovereign. Hard is the fate of
| royalty, when it cannot even be sea-sick without having all the world
called upon to consider its sufferings.

THE LIFE AND Adventures of
M I SS R O B J N S O N C R U S O E.
CHAPTER XII.
THE reader will remember the cat of the ship that came ashore
with me on the raft. Though, being an unmarried woman of a certain
age, I at first disliked cats upon principle, the animal, in my solitary
state, was a comfort to me—a comfort known only to advanced spin-
sters. One morning I was surprised as I left the hut to find puss at
the door—I had given her up for lost—with a kitten about a month
old in her mouth. She gave evident signs of satisfaction as I ca-
ressed the little thing, and leaving it in my hands, departed, and
returned from time to time, bringing each time a kitten, in all six.
At length, kittens became so numerous, that I was compelled to put
a restraint upon my feelings, and drown them. However, the reader
will acknowledge that I was blest with a tolerable circle, when I count
my rabbits, my parrots, and my cats. Having discovered that there
were birds of Paradise in the island, I sought day after day to find
their nests, that I might domesticate, their young. This, however, I
found to be impossible; and I am now of opinion that, as the bird of
Paradise never alights on the ground, or alighting, is never able to
get up again, that the creatures build high up in the clouds. How
they manage it, it is not for me to explain : I leave that, as a privilege,
to the reader. Despairing to obtain the bird alive, my next thought
was to shoot one for my bonnet. True, there was nobody to see it ;
but it would have been a sweet satisfaction to myself to know that it
tras in my bonnet.
Speaking of nobody seeing me : it was (as may be conceived) a
most perplexing circumstance that I was not able even to see myself.
The reader, I hope, remembers the loss of my mirror. This loss I
considered irreparable, when one day I recollected that my father once
read to me an account of some barbarian Grecians, or Egyptians, or
something of that sort, who made mirrors of polished steel. It struck
me that I might make myself a looking-glass of this sort. And for
this purpose, an old frying-pan that I had brought from the wreck
afforded me the best means. The time taken to polish that piece of
old iron would, I knew, be long and tedious ; but then, I had more
time on my hands than I knew what to do with ; and then the
thought that I was producing—however slowly—a looking-glass,
would sweeten the labour past expression.
To work I went ; and sifting some sea-sand through a lace veil, and
sticking the particles with wax to some brown paper, I scoured and
scoured, until, after incredible labour, brightness began to appear. I
cannot trust myself to explain my feelings when I saw the tip of my
nose first dawn in the frying-pan. I seemed for the first time, for
many a weary day, to feel the blessings of civilisation. And, by
degrees, all my nose was reflected, and—I pass over the labour of
many months—then my chin and cheeks, and finally my whole face.
The mirror at the best was not, to be sure, equal to a handsome quick-
silver looking-glass; but there it was—a great improvement on the
streams and ponds that, until that time, I had been compelled to resort
to. I was a little shocked that the sun had turned me so very brown,
and sent such a shower of freckles about my eyes and nose. And then
again, I had this comfort—for the thought in such moments was a
comfort—that nobody could see me. With that belief at our hearts,
what free agents we may very often become ! -
In good time, however—as it afterwards turned out—had I accom-
plished my mirror; for, one morning as I went towards the shore, I
saw upon the sand the print of a naked foot. My heart beat so, I
thought I should have dropt ; but there it was—plainly the mark of
a foot; and I knew it well, by its preposterous size, it could not by
any possibility be my own foot. You may judge the twitter I was in.
I sat down upon the sand. I looked closely into the foot. Was it a
man's foot or a woman's It was too small, I thought, for a man,
and, as I believed, too large for a woman's; and then I recollected what
large feet many of even my dearest acquaintance had. It was plainly
a foot ; I counted all the five toes.
And then, it appeared very strange to me that there should be the
mark of only one foot. Was the owner of the foot one-legged 2 Was
the other leg of wood 2 I searched, cautiously, but saw no othermarks.
It was plain that the island, or at least the adjacent islands, were inha-
bited ; and my thoughts flew to my trunks, and took an involuntary
inventory of all my dresses—my bonnets, and my loves of shawls, the
late property of the late female passengers.
I went immediately to the highest parts of the island, and, with my
double opera-glass, spied all about me. Not a soul was to be seen.
And then I said to myself—“It may be the footmark of neither man,
nor woman, but of some love of a spirit that has seen and adores me.”
THE SAILOR PRINCE.
As Britannia happens to rule the waves, it is very desirable that we
should have a somebody who is superior to the waves, for the office of
ruling Britannia. It is gratifying to know, that not only is HER
MAJESTY a capital sailoress, but her son, the little DUKE of CoRN-
wall, is every inch—that is, every one of his 28 inches of height—a
sailor. The young scion of Royalty, during the recent cruise, skipped
about the deck as jollily as the skipper himself, and ordered extra
allowances of grog to the men, with the true spirit of British seaman-
ship. HER MAJESTY had evidently no idea of the extent to which the
little Tar—or Tartlet—would enter into his new profession, for, in
rigging him out for the voyage, she had only provided him with one
pair of white trousers and one white waistcoat. These, of course, were
very soon soiled by the activity of the Royal reefer, and it was, there-
fore, necessary to get them washed by one of the crew, between the
Prince's bed time and the hour of mustering all hands on deck the next
morning.
It is said that his Royal Highness has already adopted some of the
phraseology peculiar to the naval service, and has once or twice
expressed a desire to have his little timbers shivered. He is frequently
engaged in practising the hornpipe so completely identified with the
naval service of his country, and he already knows the name of every
rope, spar, and brace that is required in a vessel. He sings none but
naval songs, and his execution of-
“We tars have a maxim,”
is considered by all who have heard it, to be one of the finest pieces of
nautical vocalisation in the English language.

A COMMISSION EXTRAORDINARY.
Report from “The competent persons” appointed to examine into the proposed
erection of the Wellington Military Memorial, with the evidence.
To THE RIGHT Honour ABLE THE LoRD MoRPETH, &c., &c.
My Loºp, We, “The competent persons” appointed to consider the
subject of the proposed Equestrian Statue on the arch on Constitution
Hill, beg leave to lay our Report before your Lordship, and the Honour-
able the Commissioners of Woods and Forests.
We consider that the proposed Statue will be avery striking “object,”
in the strongest sense of the word.
We consider that it will establish a new theory of proportions be-
tween statue and base, in such figures, (as the NELson Column has
established one unknown elsewhere between capital and shaft in the
case of columns), and that it will thus encourage originality of
design in England.
We consider that such statue should be erected on the proposed site,
for the following reasons:—
1st. Because nine-tenths of the public monuments of the metropolis.
are disgraceful to English Art, and absurd in the eyes of persons of
cultivated taste, it is desirable, for the sake of congruity, that the pro-
posed Memorial of his GRACE THE DUKE of WELLINGTon should be
disgraceful and absurd also.
2nd. Because the Committee of subscribers having committed them-
selves, they must continue to be ridiculous, for fear of appearing so
by retracing their steps.
3rd. Because the sub-Committee are anxious not to offend SIR FRE-
DERick TRENCH, who has a great regard for MR. WYATT, and the
RIGHT Honour.ABLE. J. W. CRokER, who has a sincere admiration for
the pig-tail GeoRGE III. of the same artist.
4th. Because at a “most affecting interview” (as it is beautifully called
by the Most Noble the MARQUIs of LoNDoNDERRY), His GRACE THE
Duke of WELLINGron was led to expect the enjoyment “of living
through many and many a long year,” for the express purpose “of see-
ing from his own windows a proud testimonial of the gratitude of an
admiring country;” and it is desirable that his Grace should not be
baulked of tasting this pleasure out of his front windows, which he can
now only enjoy from his back ones, in the contemplation of the
AcHILLEs.
We beg leave to lay before your Lordship and the honourable Board
extracts from the evidence which has guided, your Committee in their
decision :-
Die om, stult.
SIR.F.TRENch (examined).-Is a member of the sub-Committee—what
would be called a very active member. Has run about a great deal in
the business. Considers he has a fine taste. Has always thought so.
| Would have made London a very different place if he had been per-
mitted to carry out his plans. Looks upon the notion of the Statue on
the arch as his own. Perhaps MR. CRoRER might have originated it.
Thinks it the proudest achievement of his life. Has never been known
to worship the Duke of WELLINgton. Believes him to be mortal.
Thinks him, on the whole, the greatest man who ever lived. Hopes
to go down to posterity himself. Would not be ashamed to do so on
the crupper of the Duke's horse. Is aware of the usual proportions
between statue and pedestal, and of those between the figure of MR.
WYATT and the arch. Is aware they are such as were never heard of
before. Thinks they ought to be, because such a man as the Duke
was never heard of before. When on the arch, the Duke will be “in
a peculiar position.” Thinks he ought to be. Does not care for MR.
BURTox's feelings. Doesn't see why an artist should have any. Does
not intend to live in the police station in the west wing of the arch,
to point out the beauties of the Statue to visitors. Should not object
to attend on the top of the arch for the purpose, twice a-week, during
the session of Parliament. Has never said he intended to disguise
himself as a Chelsea Omnibus driver, to arouse the enthusiasm of his
passengers. Does not feel himself ridiculous. Never did, that he
knows of Has a contempt for Punch. Hasnever had articles rejected.
Has made jokes. Believes they were considered bad, but thought them
good himself.
DECIMUs BURton, Esq., Architect. (The witness was supported into
the room, and was exceedingly faint during the whole time of his exami-
nation)—Is sorry to say that he is the architect of the arch on
Constitution Hill—little thought he should ever regret it. The arch is
not fit for the pedestal of such a statue. It is too big for a pedestal.
With such a figure on it, will be too small for an arch. Gives up his
reputation to posterity. The proportions are dreadful. The arch is
sixty-seven feet high. The Statue, with its plinth, will be forty. It will
look top-heavy. Has his own design for a figure to surmount the
arch. Was never consulted about the WELLINgroN Statue. Felt it
much—was in a strait jacket for some weeks. Is better-mow, but
does not expect to get over it. Thinks, if the sub-Committee had seen
him when he saw the design, they would have changed their minds.
Doubts if they have any minds to change, now. Never threatened to
assassinate SIR F.TRENch. Forgives him, and hopes the public will
do the same. The Statue will be the most ridiculous figure, even in
London. Does not think he will ever make another design. (Here
water was given to the witness). Doubts if the figure will come down
when once up, unless it breaks down the arch. Has sometimes wished
it might. Intends going abroad when it is erected. (The witness here
became inaudible from emotion, and was removed.
PUNCH (examined.)—Is a person of highly cultivated taste. His
ancestors came from Italy. Has many relations there now, and is in
constant communication with them on matters of art. Has studied
the subject of the proposed Statue. Likes it much, for one reason.
Lives by joking, and sees a great prospect of jokes fromit. Never saw
any absurdity that promised to bring him in so much. The Trafalgar
Square Fountains were very good. So was the Nelson Column. This
is better than either. Has feelings for Art. His artistic feeling is
outraged by the erection of this figure. Has never said he could pull
it down if put up. Has said he would try. Intends to try. Hopes to
succeed.
SIR F. Trench attempted to assault this witness on leaving the
Committee Room. He was taken into custody by the Sergeant-at-
Arms.

THE beautiful affection which links together his Majesty Louis-
PHILIPPE and the Corporation of London is well known. Few
pictures more beautifully typify the harmony of France and England
than that of Moon,_his subscription-book under his arm, taking a
family dinner and extensive orders at St. Cloud. Other civic dignita-
ries (though they generally sink the shop) have enjoyed the royal hospi-
tality of France. We believe indeed that “Alderman de Londres” is an
irresistible passport to the dinners and heart of the Citizen King.
i. His Majesty, it is well known, is very much in the habit of being shot
REVIVAL OF THE PRAMA. at. The moment the event is announced in London, the Corporation is
in a flutter of delight. Addresses are voted, deputations drawn by lot,
and the lucky members rush off to Paris, drive straight, with their
carpet bags, to a royal residence, there to avail themselves, in the most
free and easy manner, of the kingly hospitality. In return for this
ready entertainment, his Majesty KING Louis-PHILIPPE is unani-
mously considered by the Corporation the greatest monarch who ever
reigned. He is the only King who has ever shown a true appreciation
of Aldermen.
MR. SHERIFF LAURIE has lately had the honour of a royal invitation
to Neuilly. He has informed the public of the fact, in a circular
addressed to all the morning and evening papers. He has neglected to
send one to Punch, but we indulge him with a commentary notwith-
standing.
MR. SHERIFF LAURIE is the worthy nephew of a wonderful uncle,
SIR PETER, the Putter-down. MR. SHERIFF LAURIE is a philanthropist.
There are several orders of philanthropists. Amongst these is one
which we may call “Brummagem philanthropy.” It glories in meetings,
and delights to parade itself on platforms. It licks the shoes of bene-
volent lords, and is especially great after public dinners. It jumps at
testimonials; and, if it have done nothing to justify the tribute, will
accept it for what it intends to perform. It seldom fails to make its
own fortune, and helps many to the same end. When they propose
“On inquiring of ourselves what are the reasons which have induced its bust, it tries to blush, but hides by giving way to its fellow-citizens.
us exclusively to patronise this place of amusement, we can really It is bustling and braggart where charity is fashionable, and benefac-
discover nothing to account for our preference of it, except the fact
that it is a fashionable rendezvous. For modern Italian composition is
at such a low ebb, that we derive little pleasure from listening to it,
when we do listen, which is seldom the case ; for we find, upon reflec-
tion, that when we are at the Opera we are generally laughing and
talking throughout the whole of the performance.
“It has therefore occurred to us that we might be just as much
delighted and entertained at any other theatre as we are at the Opera
House, provided only, that it were a place of fashionable resort. And
to give any such theatre this character, we know that we have but to
exert our influence.
“These considerations have been forced upon us, first, by the rumour
that another Italian Opera is to be instituted at Covent Garden ;
secondly, by the fact that the representations of SHAKESPEARE are
limited to Sadler's Wells and the Surrey Theatre.
“Hardly any of us, till lately, were acquainted with SHAKESPEARE,
further than with the few passages of his writings contained in the
‘Elegant Extracts, and forming our stock of quotations in Parliament
and at public meetings. We confess, too, that we believed him to be
an over-rated writer, in addition to being out of date ; and we even
own that his repute among the vulgar had given us a certain prejudice
against him. On an attentive perusal of his writings, however, we
must admit that the epithets of Divine and Immortal, commonly applied
to SHARESPEARE, are, in a qualified sense, scarcely too highly laudatory.
And we are fully convinced of the fact that those writings have really
a refining and exalting, as well as humanising tendency, whilst we
certainly cannot say quite so much of the postures and gyrations of a
ballet-dancer.
“Anxious, as we naturally are, for the dignity of our order, we cannot
view, without alarm, an influence at work among the lower classes,
(we allude particularly to the Surrey population, and that of Islington),
which threatens to elevate those persons to a level of refinement and
intellect equal to our own. At the same time, we would gladly witness
any improvement among the inferior ranks; but still we are desirous
to maintain our intellectual relation to them.
“Accordingly, without intending to withdraw our patronage from
the Opera House, we have come to the determination to support, by our
tors' names printed in capitals. Its right hand carefully records the
works of its left. It jingles its coin like a bell, before depositing it in
the plate, and rather than want a flourish over a good deed, will, on a
pinch, blow its own trumpet.
MR. SHERIFF LAURIE has blown his four tan-ta-ras in one.
Blast the First.—0 Yes / I, John LAURIE, Sheriff of London and
Middlesex, have dined with Louis-PHILIPPE, King of the French :
Blast the Second.—0 Yes / I, John LAURIE, &c., in the interval of
relaxation from my official duties, am inspecting the prisons of
France 1 !
Blast the Third-0 Yes / I, John LAURIE, &c., am on my way to
Belgium and Holland, for the same benevolent and philanthropic
purpose !!!
Blast the Fourth.-0 Yes / I, John LAURIE, &c., intend, at a future
period, to proceed to Germany, to get statistical information l l l 1
Cock-a-Doodle-Doo /
In mercy to MR. SHERIFF LAURIE we refrain from a grammatical
analysis of his remarkable letter. But we feel, as a genuine philan-
thropist, that our bâton is never so well employed as over the shoulders
of those who mix up with the solid marble of good works the rubbish
of their own ignorant vanity, and popularity-hunting conceit. We
respectfully suggest to SIR PETER LAURIE the propriety of “putting
down” his egregious nephew.
RAILWAY POACHING.
A STEAM Engine on the Eastern Counties Railway lately killed a
covey of partridges which happened to be on the line. We wonder
some of our Game-Law advocates have not prosecuted the engine for
killing game without a license. MR. GRANTLEY BERKELEY at all events
should try his favourite remedy, and give the engine “a punch on the
head.’
Not A bad Move—Joseph Any has written to the Wellington
Statue to say, if a guinea is instantly remitted, he can tell it something
to its advantage.

the old world of railways above ground,
have invented a new world of a subter-
ranean kind, in which they propose to
construct lines “under the present wide,
leading streets of London.” This is a
magnificent notion for relieving the
over-crowded thoroughfares, and at the
same time relieving any particularly
over-crowded pocket from its oppressive
burden. The prospectus states that the
thing “can be accomplished without any
serious engineering difficulties.” The
difficulties, instead of being serious, will,
we suppose, be merely laughable. If any
great dilemma should arise, it will of
course be overcome by a little jocularity.
We understand that a survey has already been made, and that many
of the inhabitants along the line have expressed their readiness to place
their coal-cellars at the disposal of the company. It is believed that
much expense may be saved by taking advantage of areas, kitchens,
and coal-holes already made, through which the trains may run with-
out much inconvenience to the owners, by making a judicious arrange-
ment of the time-table. It will certainly be awkward if a family should
be waiting for a scuttle of coals, and should not be able to get it until
after the train had gone by ; but a little domestic foresight, seconded
by railway punctuality, will obviate all annoyances of this kind.
As the contemplated railway must in several places be carried
through the sides and centre of a street, it will be necessary to arrange
with the gas and water companies, so that they may all co-operate in
this great national work. If the atmospheric principle should be
adopted, arrangements could perhaps be entered into to obtain the use
of the principal main belonging to the water-works as a continuous
valve; for if we are to judge by the arrangements on the Croydon
line, this continuous valve is a tremendous pipe, which merely lies in
the middle of the line without being used.
The Sewers, by the way, would, with a little enlargement, answer
all the purposes of the projectors of this scheme. It is true they are
half full of water; but this would not prevent the carriages from being
propelled, and the wheels might be sufficiently high to keep the bodies
of the carriages and the feet of the passengers out of the wet.
Considering the frequent stoppages of the existing thoroughfares,
the scheme really seems to deserve encouragement. “Nothing is
wanted,” says the prospectus, “for this grand undertaking, but public
support.” If the people will only come down with their money,
we should not wonder at seeing the company get as far as half-a-dozen
advertisements in the daily papers, and a brass plate in the City.
| Those who are disposed to sink a little capital cannot do better than
bury it under the Metropolis in the manner proposed.
We perceive that no amount of deposit is named, and nothing is
said of the number or nominal value of the shares. The Secretary is
announced to be in attendance to receive deposits from eleven to two;
though, whether he gets any is, in our opinion, ten to one. -- -

Encendiary Invention.
A NEw lucifer match has been invented by KING Louis-PHILIPPE.
It is the marriage of his son, the Duc DE MontPEN.sier with the young
QUEEN OF SPAIN's sister; which threatens to set all Spain, if not
Europe, in a blaze.
LOST PLEASURES 1
The Post in its criticism of To Parents and Guardians at the Lyceum
—a charming piece of natural writing, by the way, in which MR.
WIgAN acts an old French usher superbly—the Post is very eloquent
on the sufferings of the poor emigrants employed at schools —
“We ourselves knew an émigré who had commanded a brigade of cavalry reduced to
the command of a class of which he was the butt. If his eyes rested on the desk, he saw
the caricature of a lean Frenchman holding up a frog by its hind leg. The exercises were
accompanied by sketches of a well-fed Englishman and a starved Frenchman; and did
he by accident turn his head, a fish-hook was fixed in his well-powdered hair and queue.
These times and these manners are past, and we have now in their stead Young France,
the barbe bouque, and French in six lessons !”
It is impossible not to sympathise with the Post in its sorrowing for
these departed pleasures. To sketch lean Frenchmen and frogs, and to
fix fish-hooks, in the queues of Gallic ushers, were enjoyments that
strengthened in the British youth those heroic prejudices that flat-
tered them with the belief that they were the born enemies of France.
But these joys are past. Now we learn French, if not in six lessons,
certainly without the accompanying enjoyment of caricaturing and
tormenting our teacher. And there is no doubt, should we ever again
go to war, and be beaten by “our wily neighbours,” that we shallowe
the discomfiture to the fact, that the British youth no longer quiz, and
mock, and ill-use their early French teachers. Great were the
national uses of fish-hooks, applied as above 1
LORD RIPON TO HIS CURATE.
I GIVE thee all, I will no more,
Though poor the offering be:
A donkey and a cover'd cart
Are all I've got for thee;
An ass, whose gentle pace reveals
He knows his duty well ;
And, better far, a cart whose wheels
The donkey can propel.
Though cart and ass may fail, alas !
To swell your curate's pay,
At least they'll make time lighter pass,
By riding out each day;
And e'en if care should sometimes dart
A momentary pain,
A little jolting in the cart
Will drive it off again!
$jall 3Lambtrt 3,0meg jabe a $3ttgt?
THIs pregnant question has been loudly answered in the affirmative
by the Court of Common Council. LAMBERT Jones has a bust. MR.
PRENDERGAST vehemently opposed the motion, inasmuch as Jones was
neither sailor nor soldier; had never fought at Trafalgar or Waterloo;
and was therefore not fit company for LoRD NElson, who (MR. P. no
doubt thought, though he did not so express himself) would some fine
morning move himself to “a more retired ground,” in sublime disgust
of his civilian neighbour. When we consider the martial character of
the City of London; when we remember (as we do with touching emo-
tion) that the Lord MAYok is always selected from the Admiralty or
the Horse Guards; that nearly all the Aldermen wear Waterloo
medals, and sit upon the bench in cocked hats and with swords at their
sides ; when we are admonished that the Royal Exchange is not truly,
what it is vulgarly believed to be, a fabric devoted to commercial
purposes, but is, in fact, the City Arsenal, containing twenty thousand
stand of arms, with bombs, rockets, and all the other glorious and
glorifying chattels of war;-when we remember all these things, we
do not think it right that LAMBERT Jones—a mere civilian, one “who
never set a squadron in the field,” should stand in stone, cheek by
jowl with the immortal NELson.
However, Jones is in, and will of course be followed by other ignoble
citizens. LAURIE himself will, we expect, be erected in terra cotta, with
this significant inscription on his pedestal —“He put down Suicide,
and—the Wood Pavement l”
DISEASED TURNIPS,
SEVERAL paragraphs have appeared in the papers stating that the
turnips are going in all directions. We beg leave to say that we have
got a tremendous turnip—a large metal watch—whose disease consists
in a determination not to go at all.

£iatrimonial Bictionary.
EAR is a term of entreaty, usually em-
ployed before strangers. It is meant to
imply affection. It is sometimes used at
home, but is generally received with
suspicion.
MY DEAR. The above, with a slight
infusion of dignity.
Duck. A term of affection that goes
in with the wedding-day, and goes out
with the honey-moon.
DUCKEY. The comparative of DUCK.
Tootsy, Mootsy, and all words ending
in tsy, are terms of great endearment.
The exact meaning of them has never
been ascertained. They are never heard
after thirty.
Psha . A powerful contradiction, or
involuntary dissent.
NoNsENSE. A negative of intense
contempt.
DEARY ME. An exclamation of greatim-
patience—a word expressive of the fidgets.
Both ER means trouble, irritation, teasing, vexation. It is a word
of petulant anger in great request. “Don’t bother me” is equivalent
to the French “tu m’embétes.”
LovE is only used when coaxing is required, as “Do ; there's a
love.” It is also a superlative, conveying the highest praise, eac. gr. :
“The love of a fellow.” “The love of a goose.”
TooDLEDUMs. See Tootsy.
The LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
M S S R O B | N S O N C R U S O E.
CHAPTER XIII.
My thoughts full of the foot-mark, it may be supposed that I slept
but little that night. Indeed, for many nights afterwards, my rest
was disturbed by dreams of cannibals ; and again and again I
deplored my roving habits and the inconstancy of my disposition.
And then the thought returned, that the mark was not of a human
foot, but that of a spirit, enamoured of me. And then I would argue
with myself—if a spirit, why should it leave its mark where it was
only by the merest accident I saw it 2 Why not have come at once
to my hut, and put the question ? Again I would comfort myself
that it was the mark of my own foot, grossly exaggerated, of course,
by the wind or some other natural but mysterious cause. And then I
again visited the foot-print, and, taking measure of its dimensions,
felt that, under no circumstances, it could be mine.
Months passed on, and I was alternately agitated by these thoughts.
Time, however, brought back my old composure; and I was once more
enabled to stir abroad without the fear of being eaten. However, I
took the precaution of never quitting home without my pistol, which
I never fired. In the first place, I was afraid that the noise might be
heard by the savages, if any were on the island; and in the next, I
had always a very natural and very lady-like fear of fire-arms. Be-
sides my pistol, Islung a sword—a cutlass, I believe they call it—over
my shoulder ; and thus equipped, my appearance very much reminded
me of a lady that, in happier days, I had seen at AstLEY's.
I ought not to omit to state that, for better security of myself and
property, I searched all over the island, and happily discovered a deep
dark cave, hollowed by art or nature (it matters not which) in a rock.
To this place, with much trouble, I removed some of my very best
dresses, my metal looking-glass, and other treasures that I valued most.
In this cave I resolved, at the worst, to take shelter, should the savages
threaten me.
One morning, when it was scarcely daylight—for I will say this for
myself, I was always an early riser—I was astonished with seeing a
light of some fire upon the shore, about two miles distant.
convinced it was the fire of the savages, and ran back to my hut, to
keep close for the day. Curiosity, however, forbad this, and I resolved
to go forth and reconnoitre. Slinging my sword-belt, and looking to
the priming of my pistol, whilst I trembled excessively, I sallied forth,
and climbed a high hill to take a better survey. Laying myself flat
upon the ground, and arranging the sight of my double opera-glass,
I was . MADAME Tussaud's Collection, and the Fourth GEORGE,
that I had taken on purpose, I saw about thirty savages—Amazons,
all of them—dancing round a fire, and two victims ready to be roasted.
One of these I saw fall, and the next moment the other bounded for-
ward like an Italian greyhound, running to the part of the island
where my habitation was.
You may be sure of it, at this I was in a pretty twitter. However
I lay close, and saw the frightened wretch come on, pursued by two of
the Amazons; who, however, continued to lose ground with almost every
step. Coming to a deep stream, the fugitive plunged in, one of the
pursuers boldly following, but swimming heavily after the victim.
The other paused at the brink of the stream, and—as the reader may
have done in a bathing-machine,—just felt the water with a single
foot, withdrawing it, and shivering at the cold. Thus, I plucked
up heart, for I found that I had but one enemy to contend with.
At this moment, it came into my thoughts that I should obtain
what, all the time I had been upon the island, I had so much yearned
for ; namely, a lady's-maid, with no permanent followers. With this
view, cocking my pistol, and drawing my sword, I rushed down the
hill, and so placed myself between the runaway and the pursuer. Both
parties, you may believe, were somewhat astonished to behold me;
but, recovering from the surprise, the pursuing Amazon was quietly
fixing an arrow—against which my rabbit-skin would have been but
a poor defence—when, turning aside my head, and leaving my shot to
luck, I snapped the trigger, and killed my woman.
Now, the sound of the pistol brought the savage who had fled, to a
dead stand-still. Whereupon I made all sorts of encouraging motions
to her to approach ; using the same pantomime that, under the
like circumstances, I had seen at the Opera. At length, the poor
wench took heart, and came gracefully—as to slow music—to me.
Then she sunk upon her knees; then taking my foot—she was, I
thought, evidently astonished at its smallness—she put it upon her
head, as much as to say, she had a proper motion of the duty of a
servant, and that I might, if I liked, duly trample upon her.
In a little time, the wench seemed to feel quite at her ease, and
scratching up the sand, intimated that she would bury the dead
Amazon ; and this she did, apparently with the greatest pleasure in
life, in about a quarter-of-an-hour.
After this, I took the girl to my hut, and gave her some raisins and
biscuit ; and what seemed at once to win her heart, a few drops of
Eau de Cologne on lump-sugar, at which her eyes began to sparkle,
and to remind me of my boarding-school days at Blackheath.
The girl was, for a negress, a very good-looking girl. I have secn
much flatter noses, and much bigger lips owned by white Christians.
Her figure, too, was, for a savage, very genteel. Her feet, to be sure,
were a little clumsy; but then, when we come seriously to think of it,
how very few people have small feet !
It was extraordinary how soon the wench began to talk and under-
stand me ; whereupon, I let her know that her name was Friday, as
she began service with me on that day. And I was very grateful
when I looked upon her. For I thought to myself, “Now I no longer
need make my own fire, and can henceforth have my breakfast in
bed.”
WHAT TO DO WITH BUCKINGHAM PALACE.
Y MR. HUME and others it has been suggested
to convert Buckingham Palace into a Museum
- and National Gallery. Now that the Royal
* Family, like the Spectre of Otranto, is becoming
i too large for its habitation, it is certain that
# the Palace, somehow, must be applied to
another than its present purpose, it may be
| a very good plan to render that building, which
can no longer furnish a nursery to Royalty, a
nursery of Art and Science; but we think we
can suggest a better. Why should not the
Royal lodging, when vacated, be made to contri-
bute to the payment of the expenses of building another ? Let the
different apartments in the Palace out to the different metropolitan
exhibitionists. The Industrious Fleas might be established in the
Green Drawing Room ; Miss LINwood's Exhibition might be trans-
ferred to the Picture Gallery ; the Banquetting Room might be
tenanted by the Speaking Automaton ; the Throne Room might
resuming his seat, would look, in his robes, as large and natural as life.
The Hall of Buckingham might be converted into the Hall of Rome,
whilst the private apartments might be appropriately taken possession
of by ToM THUMB. Thus might this edifice, which is at present
neither ornamental nor useful, at all events acquire a title to the latter
epithet. So much for Buckingham–Palace

A BOON TO NEWSPAPERS.
s this is the time of the year when newspapers,
who have not too many advertisements are puz-
zled to fill up their columns, owing to the absence
of Parliament and the difficulty of finding subjects
to be eloquent upon, we subjoin a choice number
of paragraphs to be used by Editors as space
requires. They will be recognised as old familiar
friends, which we are sure our readers will be
pleased to meet once again :-
\ SHoweR of FRogs. – A most extraordinary
shower of frogs fell on the little town of Cheatham
ºn Tuesday last. The Mayor, who was passing up
_j the High Street at the time, was nearly knocked

- completely filled with them ; and a family of dis-
tinction had twenty-five jars of apricot jelly and
gooseberry jam, which were left out in a back
yard to cool, perfectly destroyed by them.
The Secretary of the Mechanics' Institute has
calculated, from a specimen which has been
sent, with a corroborated account of the pheno-
menon, to the British Museum, that there must
have fallen in the neighbourhood not less than
28,427 of these frogs. They are supposed to
have been blown over by a strong northerly
wind from one of the numerous frog-preserves
in the South of France.—Cheatham Independent.
ExtraordinaRY Vor ACITY of THE PIKE.-
MR. Spooney, of Spooney Lodge, was reading ||
the Morning Herald a fortnight ago on the ſº
beautiful banks of the river Dee, when he took |
out his hack-knife to cut the pages. He was |
fishing for gudgeons at the time, and having a 21 *:
beautiful bite, laid down the paper and the knife 24- -
on the grass till he had secured his prey. *w-
However, when he looked for them again, they
had both disappeared. His astonishment can be better conceived than
described, when he found them inside the belly of a pike which he caught
yesterday in the same pond. The Morning Herald had evidently been
swallowed entire, but there was nothing left of it but the leaders. This
incredible instance of the voracity of the pike was sent off by express
to the Society for the Advancement of British Science, which was sit-
ting luckily at the time at Southampton.—Coventry-Court Journal.
SINGULAR EFFECT of THE LIGHTNING.-The lightning, during the
dreadful storm of the 10th ultimo, played some curious tricks on the
electric telegraph which runs from Slopperton to Knowsbridge. Some
shirts which had been hung out to dry were completely burnt through,

whilst a covey of partridges which were sitting on the wire, not far off,
were killed dead by the violence of the shock. One of the guards made
a capital pie of them. The needles of the telegraph were also set in
motion. The clerk at each station, thinking it was a message, reduced
the movements to writing. Upon comparing the two notes, one turned
made the answer, curious enough, “XXX.”—Epping Champion.
THE AMERICAN SEA SERPENT.-The American sea-serpent appeared
off the Isle of Thanet for two days last week. Two young ladies
who had ventured out in the sea rather far, whilst bathing, and
were dancing the Cellarius before the pier, were nearly carried off.
The persons, who were looking on, received a dreadful shock. Two
bathing machines were lifted off their wheels by the enormous swell

make out of the other was the figure ten three times repeated, which
and quickly disappeared ; they were afterwards found at Dieppe.—
Ramsgate Looker-on.
Won DERFUL INSTINCT.-An old grouse has been in the habit, for
the last five years, of leaving the Moors regularly on the 10th of
August, and settling in London during the shooting season. He was
accompanied this year by a black cock and three young ones. They
are at present located, we understand, in Leicester Square.—The Cale-
donian Haggis.
Astonishing MILDNEss of THE SEAsoN.—We have been assured by a
correspondent, that MRs. SIMs, of Eve Court, has an old, birch-broom
which is actually budding.—Islington Iris.
RAILWAY LUXURIES.
THE Smoking Saloon on the Eastern Counties is only the first of a
series of luxuries which it is intended to bestow upon travellers by
railway. It is in contemplation to run a refreshment-room with every
train, so that people will have time allowed them to eat the articles
sold, instead of being restricted as at present to the privilege of pay-
ment. Various plans have been suggested to enable passengers to
swallow a cup of boiling tea or coffee, or a basin of hot soup in a
minute and a half, but it has been proved that the period specified is
quite insufficient for such a purpose. It has been suggested that there
might be kept and sold at all the refreshment rooms a preparation
similar to that which enabled a certain Monsieur CHABERT some years
ago to swallow melted lead without any inconvenience. Others have
proposed that parties should be allowed to take soup or tea into the
| carriage with them, and send back the cup or basin by the up or down
train, with a return ticket fastened to the piece of crockery as a proof
of its contents having been paid for.
The most feasible scheme is, however, a portable refreshment-room,
one of which should travel with every train; and it might be advisable
to have the boiler of the engine supplied with soup instead of plain
water. ... It has been calculated that the steam produced from the
former liquid, would have much greater force than the vapour arising
from the latter, and the power of the pea in pea soup would have a
wonderful influence on the speed of the locomotive.
A circulating library and reading-room will also be shortly placed
on the Eastern Counties, and passengers will be at liberty to subscribe
by the mile, or by the whole journey. There will be a Mechanics'
Institute for the third class, and the secretary has kindly undertaken
to deliver a course of lectures on Anatomy, Life Insurance, and other
subjects likely to prove useful to persons travelling on this railway.
REWARDS FOR STARVATION.
THE Dunmow Agricultural Society have been giving away what
they call “rewards for virtue.” We think them rewards for the
peacefulness of hunger. For instance:—
“To the widow of a labourer in husbandry who had brought up the 1
the least parochial relief, was devoted a scarlet cloak; and to the secon
presented a wash-tub and clothes-basket.”
st family with
in degree was
Thus it is something to see, through the vista of long years of poverty
and privation, the promised glory of a scarlet cloak l A capital plan,
too, on the part of the Society, to serve hunger like a whale, and “throw
a tub’’ to it.
“To the married couple, the labourer and wife, who had brought up the greatestnum-
ber of children with little or no parochial relief, was given, not a flitch of bacon, as was
formerly the case, but a gammon thereof.”
We think the “gammon” peculiarly significant. It offers, too, a
delicious illustration of the charity of the Dunmow Society, for truly
these rewards are gammon—all gammon—and nothing but gammon.
A Good Beginning.
WE, have great pleasure in stating that the funds of the Repeal
Association are, for the future, to be devoted exclusively to the
purchase of meal and Indian corn, which are to be distributed amongst
the poorest class of Irish. MR. O'Connell has given notice of a motion
to the above effect, and there is not the slightest doubt that, with his
powerful influence, the resolution will be carried into execution directly.
The weekly rent has already risen.
Isouis-Philippe's Letter.
It is said that the King of the French has written a letter of twelvo
sides to QUEEN Victoria, to mollify Her Majesty towards the Spanish
match. We do not remember, even in the Newgate Calendar, so long a
defence of child-stealing.

TALES FOR THE MARINES.
TALE THE THIRD.
UNCH fancies, Marines, that you little know what
is going on a-shore. You, whose shooting is con-
fined to the enemies of your country, who shoot
you in return,-can formino idea of shooting as
an amusement; still less can you conceive the
intense delight that is taken in it as sport by
country gentlemen. The Marines themselves
would not believe what a deal of pains they are
at ; what hosts of gamekeepers they keep, what
expenses they incur, what labours they undergo as
justices of the peace, in order to secure this
gratification. And now they are about to sacrifice
it ! To what ?—you will ask. Marines, to the
prevention of crime; to the good of our fellow men. In all your
annals, we will be bound to say you never met with such an example
of self-denial. But the truth is, that the amount of misery and demo-
ralisation at the cost of which the Game Laws have been enforced,
would surpass the limits of your credulity. Know, now, however, that
this dreadful state of things is to last no longer. A paragraph has
gone the round of the papers, stating that the game in Windsor Forest
was under strict preservation till it should please His Royal HIGHNEss
PRINCE ALBERT to take the field. We are authorised to give this
statement the fullest contradiction. The Prince has too much the wel-
fare of his consort's people at heart, to countenance, by his example,
the maintenance of a system which fills with her Majesty's subjects,
her Majesty's gaols. Nay, we are assured that His Royal Highness has
gone further. Not only has he pensioned off all the gamekeepers in
his service; but he has been heard to express his earnest wish that
every nobleman and gentleman would do the like. And most happy
are we to state that this decided expression of opinion on the part of
the Prince, has led to the establishment of an Anti-Game-Law-League,
of which, but for certain constitutional considerations, he would have
undertaken the office of President. Under these circumstances, the Pre-
sidency of the Anti-Game-Law-League has been assumed by the DUKE
of BuckINGHAM. The Vice-President is the DUKE of Rich Mond, and
the secretaryship has been assigned, by the noblemen and gentlemen
forming the League, forgetful of ancient grudges, to MR. John BRIGHT, |
as the person practically best adapted to discharge its duties. |
MR. BRIGHT has issued a prospectus of the League, which, he informs
us, already includes among its members, 12 Dukes, 50 Peers, 10,000
'Squires, 300,000 Farmers, 9 Bishops, 80 Parsons, 1 Poacher, and 1
Prince. The Treasurer is MR. GRANTLEY BERKELEY himself; and
from this fact alone the reaction against the Game Laws, which has
taken place among the landed gentry, may be judged of. The honour-
able gentleman has published a pamphlet, explanatory of the motives
of his conversion ; which are, a perception of the impossibility of main-
taining the existing laws, and of the monstrous evils they occasion.
These, MR. BERKELEY declares, are such, that, attached as he is to his
dog and gun, he would rather shoot the one with the other and then
fling both into the sea, than witness any longer an extent of mischief
so appalling. Parsons, he says, are sick of preaching, parliament of
legislating, magistrates of committing, judges of trying prisoners, for
the protection of game; and he is himself sick of advocating it.
The Council of the Anti-Game-Law-League comprises most of the
late, and all the present Ministers; and, as the voice of the country is
with them, there now exists not the shadow of a doubt that the
Game Laws will be repealed in the next session of Parliament.
The meetings of the Anti-Game-Law-League are held, pro tempore, at
the Carlton Club, until a suitable Hall shall be erected for its accommo-
dation; which, however, since the days of the Game Laws are so com-
pletely numbered, will probably not be required.
The League has already promulgated some valuable statistics, setting
forth :—1. The amount of committals under the Game Laws; also of
capital executions consequent on their operation, within the last ten
years. 2. The number of killed and wounded in poaching affrays during
the same period. 3. The value of agricultural property destroyed
annually by game. Its prospectus also assigns as one of the reasons
for its formation, the disgust felt by its members at noblemen and
gentlemen being mere poulterers, which many of them have become,
through the system of preservation.
* Lastly, it has proposed, as the subject for a prize essay, the question,
“Whether Game is Property 7" one which, we should think, would be
sufficiently settled by the fact, that when a partridge flies off one man's
land, it may legally be appropriated by another.
T. And this is the third story that Punch has the pleasure of telling—to
the Marines.

MRS. HARRIS A WITCH.
MRs. HARRIs declared the other day that she was afraid to predict
that there will be a war between France and England, for her predic-
tions—especially when they prophesy evil—are almost always verified.
We recommend the old lady to give up journalism at once, and take to
telling fortunes—or misfortunes—a trade for which she is much better
fitted than for that which she professes to follow. We beg leave to
suggest that she should write in her columns the following advertise-
ment :—
M RS. HARRIS begs leave to inform the public that she casts nativities,
tells fortunes, and dives into futurity upon very moderate terms. Individuals
sending the date of their birth, may have a prediction inserted as a leading article on
moderate terms; or Mrs. Harris may be consulted personally any day between the
hours of twelve and two, at Bridge Street, Blackfriars. Political predictions may be had
at a reduced rate, in consequence of the great accumulation now on hand, including
the celebrated prophecy that SIR. R. PEEL would not propose a repeal of the Corn Laws,
and that Lord GEongeBENTiNck would be Prime Minister within the next twelve
months. Protectionist orators can be supplied with forebodings of the ruin of the
country within any period, from six weeks to six-years, according to the price agreed
upon. Members of Parliament wishing to know the party they will be wedded to,
may be furnished with all the particulars, and may ascertain whether the union will
be advantageous or otherwise. Mrs. Harris has also a Book of Fate, which may be
consulted by Ministers for the purpose of ascertaining whether they will be successful
in their undertakings, and whether the journey—from the Opposition to the Minis-
terial benches—will be prosperous.-N.B. Please to ring the top bell, and ask for
Mrs. Harris.
Railway Smoking.
IT is announced that the smoking saloons are only to be attached to
the fast trains of the Eastern Counties Railway. We presume that the
fast trains on this line are those which are stuck fast in consequence of
stoppages. It is certainly desirable to allow the passengers, under such
circumstances, the opportunity of smoking, instead of leaving them to
fume, as they have done hitherto.
“ADIEU, THOU DREARY PILE.”

The answer he brought back was, that the poor old invalid was

THE. Fox A NID TEI E GRAPES. JERSEY GONE MAD.
THIs contemptible islet is in a state of tremendous excitement
at the idea that the QUEEN and PRINCE ALBERT were influenced
by political motives in their recent visit. Seditious placards
have been posted all over the town, calling upon the “Jersiais”
to be upon their guard, for “le serpent est sous les fleurs"—the
serpent is under the flowers. We do not understand this allusion
to a serpent under the flowers, which sounds to us as absurd as
the idea of an ophicleide under the buttercups, or a trombone
smothered in onions. According to the manifesto addressed
to the Jersiais, the QUEEN and the PRINCE came over to
reconnoitre, with the view of finding out the weak points of
Jersey, for the purpose of eventually taming down its little spirit
and crushing its little liberties. We have no hesitation in saying,
that the softest part of the population is the upper story, and
Jersey will be knocked on the head if a blow is to be struck
in the feeblest portion of its animal economy.
The English Government does not care a button about assimi-
lating the “Jersiais” to England in language, and the people of
that country may go on talking their patois and gibberish as
long as they please, for it is very likely that what they have
to say is not worth the trouble of trying to comprehend.
Les Jersiais sadly overrate their consequence if they think that
any one wants to interfere with their present constitution, laws
and language. Pooh, nonsense ! We might as well be told of
an intention to subjugate Sark, or to trip up the legs of Man
and lay the place prostrate; or perhaps, to come nearer home,
we might hear hints of a deep-laid political conspiracy to crush
the independence of the Eel Pies, or of a frightful project to
bring about the annexation of the Isle of Dogs to the Dogger
Bank. Les Jersiais may rest perfectly contented under the con-
viction that they may go on under their present arrange-
ments, so long as they do not render themselves a nuisance

THE SNOBS OF ENGLAND.
BY ONE OF THEMSELVES.
CHAPTER XXXI.-ON SOME COUNTRY SNOBS.
TIRED of the town, where the sight of the closed shutters of the
nobility, my friends, makes my heart sick in my walks ; afraid almost
to sit in those vast Pall Mall solitudes, the Clubs, and of annoying the
Club waiters, who might, I thought, be going to shoot in the country,
but for me, I determined on a brief tour in the provinces, and paying
some visits in the country which were long due.
My first visit was to my friend MAJoR Ponto, (H. P. of the Horse
Marines), in Mangelwurzelshire. The Major in his little phaeton, was
in waiting to take me up at the station. The vehicle was not certainly
A NicE TURN-out Fort THE PARK,
but such a carriage as would accommodate a plain man (as Ponto
said he was) and a numerous family. We drove by beautiful fresh
fields and green hedges, through a cheerful English landscape ; the
high road, as smooth and trim as the way in a nobleman's park, was
charmingly checkered with cool shade and golden sunshine.
Children, with cheeks as red as the apples in the orchards, bobbed
curtsies to us at the cottage-doors. Blue church spires rose here and
there in the distance : and as the buxom gardener's wife opened the
white gate at the Major's little ivy-covered lodge, and we drove
through the neat plantations of firs and evergreens, up to the house,
my bosom felt a joy and elation which I thought it was impossible to
experience in the smoky atmosphere of a town.
exclaimed, “is all peace, plenty, happiness.
SNoBs. There can be none in this charming Arcadian spot.”
STRIPEs, the Major's man, (formerly corporal in his gallant corps),
received my portmanteau, and an elegant little present, which I had
brought from town as a peace-offering to MRs. PoNTo ; viz., a cod
and oysters from GRoves's, in a hamper about the size of a coffin.
Ponto's house (“The Evergreens.” MRs. P. has christened it) is a
perfect Paradise of a place. It is all over creepers, and bow-windows,
and verandahs. A wavy lawn tumbles up and down all round it,
with flower-beds of wonderful shapes, and zigzag gravel walks, and
beautiful but damp shrubberies of myrtles and glistening laurustinums,
which have procured it its change of name. It was called Little
Bullock's Pound in old Doctor Ponto's time. I had a view of the pretty
grounds, and the stable, and the adjoining village and church, and a great
park beyond, from the windows of the bed-room whither Ponto conducted
Ine.
chambers ; the air was fragrant with a large bouquet that was placed
on the writing table; the linen was fragrant with the lavender in which
it had been laid; the chintz hangings of the bed and the big sofa were, if
not fragrant with flowers, at least painted all over with them ; the pen-
wiper on the table was the imitation of a double dahlia ; and there
was accommodation for my watch in a sun-flower on the mantelpiece.
A scarlet-leafed creeper came curling over the windows, through
which the setting sun was pouring a flood of golden light. It was all
flowers and freshness. O how unlike those black chimney-pots in St.
Alban's Place, London, on which these weary eyes are accustomed to
look.
“It must be all happiness here, Ponto,” said I, flinging myself down
into the snug bergère, and inhaling such a delicious draught of country
air as all the millefleurs of MR. ATKINsoN's shop cannot impart to any
the most expensive pocket-handkerchief.
“Nice place, isn't it 7” said Ponto. “Quiet and unpretending. I
like everything quiet. You've not brought your valet with you ?
STRIFEs will arrange your dressing things ; ” and that functionary,
entering at the same time, proceeded to gut my portmanteau, and to
lay out the black kerseymeres, “the rich cut velvet Genoa waistcoat,”
the white choker, and other polite articles of evening costume, with
Rustics
in snowy smock-frocks, jerked their hats off smiling as we passed.
It was the yellow bed-room, the freshest and pleasantest of bed-
great gravity and dispatch. “A great dinner-party,’” thinks I to my-
self, seeing their preparations (and not, perhaps, displeased at the idea
that some of the best people in the neighbourhood were coming to see
me). “Hark, there's the first bell ringing !” said Ponto, moving
| away; and, in fact, a clamorous harbinger of victuals began clanging
from the stable turret, and announced the agreeable fact that dinner
would appear in half-an-hour. “If the dinner is as grand as the
dinner-bell,” thought I, “faith, I'm in good quarters : " and had
"leisure, during the half-hour's interval, not only to advance my own
person to the utmost polish of elegance which it is capable of receiving,
to admire the pedigree of the Pontos hanging over the chimney, and
the Ponto crest and arms emblazoned on the wash-hand basin and
jug, but to make a thousand reflections on the happiness of a country
life—upon the innocent friendliness and cordiality of rustic intercourse;
and to sigh for an opportunity of retiring, like Ponto, to my own
fields, to my own vine and fig-tree, with a placens uxor in my domus,
and a half-score of sweet young pledges of affection sporting round my
paternal knee.
Clang ! At the end of the thirty-minutes, dinner-bell number two
pealed from the adjacent turret. I hastened down stairs, expecting to
find a score of healthy country folks in the drawing-room. There was
only one person there; a tall and Roman-nosed lady, glistering over
with bugles, in deep mourning. She rose, advanced two steps, made
a majestic curtsey, during which all the bugles in her awful head-
dress began to twiddle and quiver — and then said, “MR. SNoB,
we are very happy to see you at the Evergreens,” and heaved a
great sigh.
This, then, was Mrs. MAJoR Ponto ; to whom, making my very
best bow, I replied, that I was very proud to make her acquaintance,
as also that of so charming a place as the Evergreens.
Another sigh. “We are distantly related, MR. SNoB,” said she,
shaking her melancholy head. “Poor dear Lond RUBADUB : ”
“O,” says I; not knowing what the deuce Mrs. MAJoR Ponto meant.
“MAJoR Ponto told me that you were of the Leicestershire Snobs;
a very old family, and related to LoRD SNoBBINGToN, who married
LAURA RUBADUB, who is a cousin of mine, as was her poor dear father,
for whom we are in mourning. What a seizure 1 only sixty-three,
and apoplexy quite unknown until now in our family . In life we are

| “Why, really Ma'am, I—I don't know,” I replied, more and more
“Here,” I mentally fused.
fiere, I shall be rid ºf.”.
As she was speaking I heard a sort of cloop, by which well-known
sound I was aware that somebody was opening a bottle of wine, and
| Ponto entered, in a huge white neckcloth, and a rather shabby black
suit.
“My love,” MRs. MAJoR Ponto said to her husband ; “we were
|talking of our cousin—poor dear Lond RUBADUB. His death has
placed some of the first families in England in mourning. Does LADY
| RUBADUB keep the house in Hill Street, do you know * *
I didn't know, but I said “I believe she does,” at a venture ; and,
|lººking down on the drawing-room table, saw the inevitable, abomi-
|nable, maniacal, absurd, disgusting Peerage, open on the table, inter-
leaved with annotations, and open at the article “SNoBBINgtoN.”
“Dinner is served,” says STRIPEs, flinging open the door; and I
gave MRs. MAJoR Ponto my arm.
“THE GIRLS WE LEAVE BEHIND US 1”
This, we believe, is a favourite military air, ordinarily played by
soldiers on quitting quarters, where their red coats, ALBERT hats, and
many heroic virtues have melted the hearts of servant maids. PRIvate
GeoRGE WALsh, of the Queen's Own, must have felt particularly elated
by the melody when marching, a few days ago, from the Kensington
cavalry barracks on his way to Dublin. Very pleasing must the
melody have been to the regimental ruffian ; as, on the previous night,
he had most brutally assaulted a respectable woman in the Gloucester
Road, Brompton, and was therefore avoiding punishment; for, on the
aggrieved party appearing at the Hammersmith police office—the
scoundrel having charged the poor woman with stealing his stick and
glove—MR. CLIVE said, “all he could do in the case, under the circum-
stances, was to order the prisoner”—the outraged victim—“to be
discharged 1" Such is the award of justice, when a soldier of the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE POLITICAL *SIR ROGER DE COVERLEY.
SIR Robert has been playing SIR Roger at his estate in the country. He has been
patting little boys upon the head—a mark of condescension for which Young BEN DIsrAELI
would have given the best part of his head, namely, his ears, when SIR Robert came into
office a few years ago as Prime Minister. It must be exceedingly refreshing to the Right
Honourable Baronet, after the turmoils of political life, to be able to walk about among people
who are not occupied in applying to him every abusive epithet. We, who have been on a visit
to the Ex-premier, can testify to the pleasure which he has derived from his late tranquillity.
OLD BAILEY SENTENCES.
We have sometimes thought, when we have read the droll discrepancy of sentences
passed in our courts of law (for they are droll to the contemplative, philosophic mind, though
not always so to the vulgar people in the dock) that much of the criminal business might be
transacted in a far more economic, and withal more agreeable way than according to
present usage. We have a notion that, if carried out, would deprive the Old Bailey of much
of its solemn pomp, to be sure ; but likewise of much of its gloom. It is very awful, no doubt,
to see the ermined judge, his dignity supported by awful aldermen, upon the bench. Pleasant,
too, is it to regard the assembly of wigged and gowned sages, with tongues on hire, to lick
clean dirtied reputations; to take the stains out of human character; to open the prison
doors, and “let go free” the lucky rascal, whose villany has had the benefit of eloquence.
All this is delightful to contemplate ; and we feel our spirit make a graceful obeisance to
the majesty of law. Nevertheless, we would simplify the whole process. Instead of occu-
pying the time of a judge, the precious time of an alderman, and the more precious hours
of the petty jury, we would appoint a good cribbage-player, a cunning hand at dominoes,
or a tolerable dab at put, to play with the unfortunate people accused of larcenies and felonies,
for the various sentences to be passed upon them. The stakes might vary from one month's
imprisonment to seven years' transportation on one hand, and entire and instant freedom on
the other. If a man lost the heaviest stake, he would at all events have the satisfaction
to know that his own skill, or the run of luck, or the cards, were against him. He would
not, as possibly may now be the case, have his captivity embittered by the thought that its
lengthened term was not wholly attributable to the amount of his guilt, but to the peculiar
temper, or increase of bile, or indigestion of the judge who tried him. He would feel that he
had been fairly out-pegged at cribbage, and submit to his fate with the resignation of
a sage.
Now, according to the present operation of the criminal law, mark what a zigzag course
it takes.
- One WILLIAM STANDEN appeared before the Common Sergeant, charged with stealing
a crab, value 1s. 6d., the property of the South-Eastern Railway Company. The crab was
alive, and the prisoner, to make sure of it, took it—claws and all—to his bosom. After
this, it may be supposed, he cared but little
for the terrors of the law. He was, however,
found guilty, and the Common Serjeant said:—
“All robberies by servants of public companies, particu-
larly railways, he was determined to punish severely, and
had the article stolen been anything else, he should have
him for six months, and order him to be kept to hard
labour."
How fortunate the crab was not a salmon,
LIAM STANDEN been expatriated . What a lucky
thief He was surely born under Cancer
“Anything else” but a crab, and the rogue had
surely “suffered a sea change.” That great
naturalist, PETER PINDAR, has informed us that
“fleas are not lobsters.” In the mind of the
Common Sergeant crabs are not property; that
is, when compared to “anything else.”
Nay, we are wrong. For immediately follow-
from a pair of “tights” left in the dressing-
room of a threepenny theatre in Lambeth. For
this peccadillo the Common Sergeant sentences
the prisoner “to four months' imprisonment,”
with not a word about hard labour, in the House
of Correction. Thus, to steal a crab, value 1s. 6d.,
is a far greater offence than to steal £50 in
“notes of the Bank of England . "
On a subsequent day,+
“Joseph PULBRook, a genteelly-dressed youth, aged 19,
was indicted for embezzling the sums of £24, fºll.13s. 9d.
and at 9, which he had received on the account of MR.
John Swinform BAsseTT, to whom he was clerk.”
The case was proved. Whereupon—
a very painful duty to bat ish a lad of his age, but public
justice demanded that he be transported beyond the seas
for seven years.
We take it, if Joseph PULBRook be aware of
the above sentences of his fellow-prisoners, he
| would have been much better satisfied with his
| own lot had it fallen to him from ill-luck at crib-
bage, put, or dominoes, than falling to him from
the lips of the Common Sergeant.

head, and a very confident expression, was charged
before the Bench with a most flagitious act of
child-stealing. The case was very protracted,
and involved many statements and counter-state-
ments, but may be briefly summed up as follows:–
It appeared that a Spaniard, named FERDI-
NAND, who had distinguished himself as a man
milliner—having been specially appointed as
Petticoat-maker and Embroiderer to the Holy
Virgin—died some years ago at Madrid, leaving
behind him two little infant girls ; and it was
for the crafty abduction of the younger of these
children, by name LUISA—a young creature
scarcely marriageable — that the prisoner was
brought to the bar. He was an old offender, full
of subtleties and tricks, which he played off under
the guise of the most enchanting bonhommie, which,
of course, only rendered him the more dangerous.
This, however, was the first time he had appeared
at the Bar of Public Opinion as a child-stealer.
It was shown in evidence that the Petticoat Maker died very rich ;
and there was no doubt that the immense wealth of the unfortunate
LUIs A was one reason for drawing upon her the attention of the pri-
soner ; who had also-there could be no doubt of it—considerable
hopes of obtaining further advantages, by meddling in her family
affairs; and further of ultimately obtaining the larger share of the
property on the death of her sister, reputed not to be of the most vigo-
rous constitution. It was shown that ORLEANs had had crafty accom-
plices in the business. He had introduced into the house of the young
ladies a French hair-dresser, named BREsson, who had turned the
head of the innocent LUISA with the most glowing description of OR-
LEANs, surnamed MoRTPEN.sier ; a youth with great precocity of
moustache. The hair-dresser BREsson had also contrived to give the
young man's portrait (painted for the occasion) to the hapless LUISA ;
and the effect of a portrait of a handsome young man upon a girl of
fourteen would be obvious.
Finally, a contract of marriage had been brought about by the crafti-
ness of the hair-dresser; and the child—however it might be attempted
to palliate the circumstances by the forms of law—the child was, in a
N
word, stolen from herself, her country, and her relations, by the guile
and avarice of the prisoner at the bar.
The Court regretted that it could not interfere in even so flagitious
a case. The prisoner must be discharged ; though he must not for a
moment suppose that he left the court with clean hands.
Hereupon the prisoner gave a knowing wink, chuckled, and left the
court, humming “Oi peut-on étre mieur, qu'au sein de sa famille 1"
NEW CLANS IN THE HIGHLANDS.
Owing to the rapid conversion of the greater portion of the Scottish
Highlands into pastures, a remarkable change is taking place among
the inhabitants of those regions, consisting in the introduction of an
entirely new description of clans, which threaten altogether to supersede
the Aborigines. Of these we may mention the CIAN-LAMB and the
CIAN-WetheR, which, with the CLAN-Ewe, occupy considerable tracts
of country, whence they have quite expelled the original inhabitants.
The CLAN-LEICESTERSHIRE is daily extending itself among the hills,
and the CLAN-SouTHDown is fast replacing the mountaineers of the
North. The MAC-GREgoRs and MAC-ALPINEs are quickly disappearing
before the MERINos and MAC-RAMs, and the craigs that once echoed to
the strains of the bagpipe resound now only to the tinkling of the
sheep-bell. The Chiefs of these new clans are great dukes and noble-
men, whose influence enables them to hold their own ; or rather what,
properly speaking, is not their own, being, in fact, the birthright of the
Gaël...The worst of the matter is, that these flocks of intruders eat up
everything on the face of the country, and poor DoNALD, ousted from
home, wanders on the hill-side with nothingto live upon.
CURIOSITIES OF JUSTICE.
oUIs PHILIPPE ORLEANs, an old man, with a large th
&ſje $peaking automatom on 3&aiſhyapg.
It has been suggested that it would be a very great improvement to
e electric telegraph—or as SIR J. HERscHEL calls it, “the scum and
effervescence of science”—if the Speaking Automaton were combined
with it. The communications made from station to station, might
then be spoken at once, instead of being conveyed by signs, which are
not easily understood by any but a person accustomed to interpret
them. A figure could also be placed at the ticket platform, for the
| purpose of articulating—“Tick—ets. Gents—get—your—tick—ets
|r-r-r-ea—dy” at the place appointed for receiving the documents.
| At the South Western Railway Station speaking automata would
| save an immense deal of trouble to the clerks, who generally object to
|speak at all, when a question is asked of them. Besides, there is a
blandness in the tones of an automaton, which would be refreshing
| after the sharp, or rather the blunt manner in which a railway official
replies—when he deigns to reply at all—to the questions put to him.
| A speaking automaton might also be useful to the South-Eastern
Company, for the questionable policy of increasing the fares causes
the directors to be assailed with queries which it would tire anything
but a piece of mechanism to answer.
A number of speaking automata would also be found very service-
able as representatives of the Railway King, who is chairman of so
many companies, that he cannot be present personally at all the
meetings. If his place were to be supplied by an automaton communi-
|cating by means of the electric telegraph with his own house, he could
easily address the various boards, however far they might be apart
from each other, or distant from his residence.

ralship detained MR.
BRIEFLEss in town an
entire week, but he caused
it to be distinctly under-
stood from the first that
he could not take office
if he were asked to be a

Finding he was not asked
to be a party to anything,
he left town by the Sylph

stock—for his summer
box at Greenwich. It is
highly to his credit that
he at once relinquished
all claims to the vacant
Generalship before it was
offered to him, and thus prevented the Government from being placed
in a position of embarrassment on this subject.
When the vacancy in the Solicitor-Generalship became known, there
was a very full meeting of the Bar in the robing-room at the Middle-
sex Sessions. Several suggestions were thrown out, but not one of
them was adopted.
THE LONDON GOLD FISHERIES.
A'NEw commerce has lately sprung up in London. The flower-pot
season is over ; the crockery business is broken up ; bird-cages hang
on hand; and the only commodity at present which seems to open the
hearts and pockets of housekeepers, are gold fish. They are sold alive,
and are carried about from house to house in large bowls. The price
of a good-sized couple is an old pair of boots. If two more are thrown
in, they fetch a great-coat. Husbands cannot be too much on their
guard, and are recommended to look closely after their wardrobes,
as this new kind of bait takes wonderfully with women, and young
wives have been found to bite very readily at these gold fish. They
are very plentiful ; and this new custom of sending round the bowl,
promises to be very profitable to those who have taken it in hand.
IEnough to Shake the Universe.
A sermes of earthquakes have been going over Europe. They have
been stopping, lately, in Italy, going from Naples to Rome. The last

As the period approaches for the elevation of this gigantic triumph
of bad taste over public opinion, curiosity and fear begin to alternate
in the minds of the people. Many are wondering whether any arrange-
ment will be made for accommodating the public with a sort of semi-
amphitheatrical gallery, to view the monster after its erection, in the
style which the annexed engraving illustrates.
We understand, however, that the greatest sensation has been excited
at the Antipodes, and a petition is now on its way from New South
Wales, entreating the Home Government not to allow the erection of a
statue which seems to be expected to crush the arch, fall right through
the world, entering at Hyde Park Corner and coming out with a tre-
mendous crash at the top of George Street, Sydney. We are not pre-
pared to say that the fears of our colonists are completely groundless,
and we strongly recommend that their petition should be taken into
consideration as early as possible. For what we know—and the point
is really a nice one for the British savans—the occasional occurrence
of eruptions and earthquakes may be caused by weights falling through
from some other hemisphere.
When CURTIUs leaped horse and all into the gulf, he may probably
have created a hill on the side of the world opposite to that in which
he performed his celebrated rapid act of patriotic horsemanship. If
the Statue of the Duke should “go through the world like a child at a
feast”—that is to say, making a hole in everything—there can be no
doubt that the people of New South Wales will be tremendous sufferers.
It is right that the Duke should go down to posterity, but it is awful
to think of his going down to the Antipodes.

HOW TO WORK A TELEGRAPH.
THE Constitutionnel wonders that the Electric Telegraph makes no
progress in France. “America, England, Belgium, and almost every
other country possesses it,” says the paper, “but our own.” This
riddle is easily explained. The Electric Telegraph, unfortunately, can
be worked in all weathers, and at a moment's notice. Now the wooden
telegraph has the advantage of being interrupted by the fog, and
enjoys the superiority of being stopped suddenly in the midst of a most
important communication by a summer cloud or a drop of rain. It can
be only worked, also, during the day. All these advantages are well
known by Monsieur THIERs, Louis-PHILIPPE, and others, who, on
many occasions, have not been too proud to work the telegraph to
their own private good. We are afraid the Electric Telegraph will not
have a chance in France as long as the present one is found to be such
# fortune to ministers, by communicating in a direct line with the
ourse.

TS-
O F T H E STATU E.
THE last few days will be remarkable in British annals for having
witnessed what may be called the Crowning Folly of placing the
Duke's Statue on the arch at Hyde Park Corner.
At an early hour on the morning of Tuesday, the 29th of September,
a constant stream of human beings began pouring in the direction of
the studio of MR. WYATT, the artist, where the Mammoth horse had
been born and bred, and whence it had been found impossible to release
him without taking off the roof of his domicile.
We wandered up, more in sorrow than in anger, towards the Edge-
ware Road, and had not gone very far when we heard, in advance of
us, a laugh of frantic derision from the populace. On looking before
us, as far as the eye could reach, we saw.standing out against the
horizon a brazen monster, which seemed rapidly coming towards us
like one of those figures shown in the course of a series of optical
illusions at a place of public amusement. The effect of the figure's
approach partook about equally of the absurd and the terrible. The
young and robust laughed, the old trembled, but the babies positively
screamed, as the gigantic horse came like a night-mare amidst the
dense mass of people. We saw a nursery-maid go off into violent
hysterics ; while in the midst of the confusion a gentleman near us
seemed so paralysed that he seized hold of our watch in order, no
doubt, to keep himself from falling. Another individual expected
probably to be affected even to tears, for he snatched our pocket hand-
kerchief, and hurried into the midst of the crowd—to hide, of course,
the intensity of his emotion.
As the enormous mass approached, we were enabled to take a closer
and calmer view of it. Forty horses had been advertised to run ; but
as there were only twenty-nine starters, we presume that the other
eleven were seized with nervous headache at the last moment, and
backed out of the affair rather shabbily.
We confess that we were greatly disappointed with the appearance
of the twenty-nine animals that drew the statue, and it cannot be said
that they came forward in the “handsomest manner,” for their trap
pings were very far from elegant. They were covered with green bays,
it is true, but they had not that portliness which might have been ex-
pected in horses connected with MEssRs. GoDING's establishment.
I'erhaps, however, they may have got a little out of condition even in
the first mile of their journey ; for it must have been a very trying
situation for any horse to have been placed in. The draymen, also, disap-
pointed us ; they were not those burly and substantial looking fellows
that the preliminary paragraphs in the newspapers had led us to anti-
cipate.
But what shall we say of the Statue itself, with its ears stretched
forward, and looking like a couple of large brazen cornets for the recep-
tion of bon bons. We could not see the Duke himself, for we were too
much wrapped up in his cloak and cocked hat. The latter resembles 8.
kind of cowl, placed on chimney-pots to prevent them from smoking, but
in place of the usual arrow to tell the direction of the wind, there is a
beautiful bunch of metal feathers, which vibrate in the wind with most
mournful music. As to the Duke's cloak, it is a capital design for get-
ting rid of artistical difficulties. Like charity, it covers a multitude of
slns.
By an arrangement with the gas-light man, we had secured the
interior of a large lamp at the corner of Oxford Street, and had sa;
down comfortably on the burner, expecting to be out of the way of all
danger, when the gigantic figure, as if in a spirit of retaliation, came
rattling down with all its force, and caught its wheel upon the very
| lamp-post we had selected for our private box from which to view the
procession. That the greatest light of the age was not extinguished in
a street lamp, is a miracle ; but throwing ourselves upon our country.
men, we were drifted on the tide of population towards the park
railings. We recollect nothing more, until we found ourselves oppºsite
the classical Curds-and-Whey House at Hyde Park Corner, where
haporths of milk are served out, amid plaster of Paris statues ºf
Apollo BELVIDEREs, DIANAs and LAOCooNs. VENUS may there be
seen rising from the sea behind a milk-pail, while Romulus is throwing
the discus into a plate of seedy biscuits. CINCINNATUS may le
observed tying his sandal at the back of a large basin of the afternoon”
milk, and the cream of the Spartan youth are visible above the skim
of yesterday. The roars of the multitude soon roused us from the con-
templation of these objects to look at another object, for the Statue
had reached its destination. At this moment the scene around was
magnificent.
On the top of the arch opposite to the one where the Statue was tº
be placed, were a number of people with a square box, supposed tº be
a daguerreotype, with which they pretended to have received official
orders to take a view of the proceeding, and so got a capital sight of
everything. The surrounding space was one vast amphitheatre,
even the invalids on St. George's Hospital were clustered up on every
part of the roof, looking “like patients on a monument,” smiling *
SIR F. TheNCH.
What will be the result of this proceeding we scarcely dare tº
prophesy. We have already said that the weight of the horse nº
break the arch, and if it does not, we can only request the British
public in fairness to suspend their judgment until they see the end ºf".
If the arch is not crushed to-day, it may be to-morrow ; and if not
to-morrow, it may be the day after ; so that, until the arrival of thº'
to morrow, which we know never comes, we cannot be charged with
having failed in our prediction.

THE SNOBS OF ENGLAND.
BY ONE OF THEMSELVES.
CHAPTER XXXII.-A VISIT TO SOME COUNTRY SNOBS.
F the dinner to
which we now sate
down, I am not
going to be a severe
critic. The maho-
gany I hold to be
inviolable; but this
I will say, that I
prefer Sherry to
Marsala when I
* can get it, and the
| latter was the wine
º of which I have no
... doubt I heard the
- “cloop” just before
dinner. Nor was it
particularly good of
its kind ; however,
Mrs. MAJOR Ponto
did not evidently
know the difference,
for she called the
liquor Amontillado
during the whole of
the repast, and
drank but half a glass of it, leaving the rest for the Major and his
guest.
STRIPEs was in the livery of the Ponto family—a thought shabby
but gorgeous in the extreme—lots of magnificent worsted lace, and
livery buttons of a very notable size. The honest fellow's hands, I
remarked, were very large and black ; and a fine odour of the stable
was wafted about the room as he moved to and fro in his ministration.
I should have preferred a clean maid-servant, but the sensations of
Londoners are too acute perhaps on these subjects ; and a faithful
John, after all, is more genteel.
From the circumstance of the dinner being composed of pig's-head
mock-turtle soup, of pig's-fry and roast ribs of pork, I am led to
imagine that one of Ponto's black Hampshire's had been sacrificed a
It was an excellent and comfortable
repast ; only there was rather a sameness in it, certainly. I made a
similar remark the next day.
During the dinner MRs. Ponto asked me many questions regarding
the nobility, my relatives. “When LADY ANGELINA Skeggs would
come out"; and if the Countess, her Mamma, (this was said with much
archness and he-he-ing) still wore that extraordinary purple hair
dye 2 ” “Whether my Lord GUTTLEBURY kept, besides his French
chef, and an English cordon-bleu for the roasts, an Italian for the con-
fectionary 2" “Who attended at LADY CLAPPERCLAw's conversa-
zioni ?” and “Whether SIR John CHAMPIgnos's Thursday Mornings'
were pleasant 7" “Was it true that LADY CARABAs, wanting to pawn
her diamonds, found that they were paste, and that the Marquess had
disposed of them beforehand * * “How was it that SNUFFIN, the great
tobacco merchant, broke off the marriage which was on the tapis
between him and their second daughter; and was it true that a
mulatto lady came over from the Havanna and forbid the match 7”
“Upon my word, Madam,” I had begun, and was going on to say
that I didn't know one word about all these matters which seemed so
to interest MRs. MAJor Ponto, when the Major, giving me a tread or
stamp with his large foot under the table, said— -
“Come, come, Snob, my boy, we are all tiled you know. We knote
you're one of the fashionable people about town : we saw your name
at LADY CLApprºclaw's soirées, and the CHAMPIGNoN breakfasts and
as for the RUBADUBs, of course, as relations—” * *
“Oh, of course, I dine there twice a week,” I said ; and then I re-
membered that my cousin, Htºrtfºrty Sson, of the Middle Temple, is a
great frequenter of genteel societies, and to have seen his name in the
Morning Post, at the tag end of several party lists. So, taking the
hint, I am ashamed to say I indulged Mrs. MAJoR Ponto with a deal
of information about the first families in England, such as would
astonish those great personages if they knew them. I described to
her most accurately the three reigning beauties of last season at
ALMACR's : told her in confidence that His GRACE THE D– of
W. was going to be married the day after his Statue was put
up : that His GRACE THE D of D– was also about to lead
the fourth daughter of the ARCHDUKE STEPHEN to the hymeneal
altar :—and talked to her, in a word, just in the style of MRs. GoRE's
last fashionable novel.
MRs. MAJoR was quite fascinated by this brilliant conversation.
She began to trot out scraps of French, just for all the world as they
do in the novels ; and kissed her hand to me quite graciously, telling
me to come soon to caffy, and ung pu de Musick o salong—with which
she tripped off like an elderly fairy.
T“Shall I open a bottle of Port, or do you ever drink such a thing
as Hollands and water,” says Ponto, looking ruefully at me. This
was a very different style of thing to what I had been led to expect
from him at our smoking-room at the Club : where he swaggers about
his horses and his cellar ; and slapping me on the shoulder used to
say, “Come down to Mangelwurzelshire, Snob, my boy, and I'll give
you as good a day's shooting, and as good a glass of Claret as any in
the county.”—“Well,” I said, “I liked Hollands much better than
Port, and Gin even better than Hollands.” This was lucky. It tras
gin ; and STRIPEs brought in hot water on a splendid plated tray.
The jingling of a harp and piano soon announced that MRs. PoNTo's
ung pu de Musick had commenced, and the smell of the stable again
entering the dining-room, in the person of STRIPEs, summoned us to
caffy and the little concert. She beckoned me with a winning smile to
the sofa, on which she made room for me, and where we could com-
mand a fine view of the backs of the young ladies who were performing
the musical entertainment. Very broad backs they were too, strictly
according to the present mode, for crinoline or its substitutes is not an
expensive luxury, and young people in the country can afford to be in
the fashion at very trifling charges. Miss EMILY Ponto at the piano,
and her sister MARIA at that somewhat exploded instrument, the harp,
were in light blue dresses that looked all flounce, and spread out like
MR. GREEN’s balloon when inflated.
“Brilliant touch EMILY has-what a fine arm MARIA's is "MRS.
Ponto remarked good-naturedly, pointing out the merits of her daugh-
ters, and waving her own arm in such a way as to show that she was
not a little satisfied with the beauty of that member. I observed she
had about nine bracelets and bangles, consisting of chains and padlocks,
the Major's miniature, and a variety of brass serpents with fiery ruby
or tender turquoise eyes, writhing up to her elbow almost, in the most
profuse contortions.
“You recognise those polkas 2 They were played at Devonshire
House on the 23rd of July, the day of the grand fête 7” So I said
yes—I knew 'em quite intimately; and began wagging my head as if
in acknowledgment of those old friends.
When the performance was concluded, I had the felicity of a pre-
sentation and conversation with the two tall and scraggy Miss Pontos;
and Miss WIRT, the governess, sate down to entertain us with varia-
tions on “Sich a gettin' up stairs.” They were determined to be in
the fashion.
For the performance of the “Gettin' up Stairs,” I have no other
name but that it was a stunner. First Miss WIRT, with great delibe.
ration, played the original and beautiful melody, cutting it, as
it were, out of the instrument, and firing off each note so loud, clear,
and sharp, that I am sure STRIPEs must have heard it in the stable.
“What a finger ſ” says MRs. Ponto ; and indeed it was a finger, as
knotted as a turkey's drumstick, and splaying all over the piano,
When she had banged out the tune slowly, she began a different
manner of “Gettin' up Stairs,” and did so with a fury and swiftness
quite incredible. She spun up stairs; she whirled up stairs ; she
gallopped up stairs ; she rattled up stairs; and then, having got the
tune to the top landing, as it were, she hurled it down again shrieking
to the bottom floor, where it sank in a crash as if exhausted by the
breathless rapidity of the descent. Then Miss WIRT played the
“Gettin' up Stairs” with the most pathetic and ravishing solemnity;
plaintive moans and sobs issued from the keys—you wept and
trembled as you were gettin' up stairs. Miss WIRT's hands seemed
to faint and wail and die in variations : again, and she went up with
a savage clang and rush of trumpets, as if Miss WIRt was storming *

gasp of admiration—a deep-breathing gushing sound, such as you
hear at Church when the sermon comes to a full stop.
Miss WIRT put her two great double-knuckled hands round a waist
of her two pupils, and said, “My dear children, I hope you will be
able to play it soon as well as your poor little governess. When I
lived with the DUNSINANEs, it was the dear Duchess's favourite, and
LADY BARBARA and LADY JANE Mc BETH learned it. It was while
hearing JANE play that, I remember, that dear LoRD CASTLEToDDY.
first fell in love with her ; and though he is but an Irish Peer, with
not more than fifteen thousand a-year, I persuaded JANE to have him.
Do you know Casletoddy, MR. SNoB —round towers—sweet place—
County Mayo. Old Lord CAstletoddy (the present Lord was then
LoRD INIshowAN) was a most eccentric old man—they say he was
mad. I heard His Royal Highness the poor dear DUKE of Sussex—
§. a man, my dears, but alas ! addicted to smoking !)—I heard His
oyal Highness say to the MARQUIs of ANGLESEY, “I am sure Castle-
Toddy is mad ' ' but INIshowAN wasn't, in marrying my sweet JANE,
though the dear child had but her ten thousand pounds pour tout
potage 1”
“Most invaluable person,” whispered MRs. MAJon Ponto to me.
“Has lived in the very highest society: ” and I, who have been accus-
tomed to see governesses bullied in the world, was delighted to find
this one ruling the roast, and to think that even the majestic MRs.
Ponto bent before her.
As for my pipe, so to speak, it went out at once. I hadn't a word
to say against a woman who was intimate with every Duchess in the
| Red Book. She wasn't the rose-bud, but she had been near it. She
had rubbed shoulders with the great, and about these we talked all the
evening incessantly, and about the fashions, and about the Court, until
bed-time came.
. “And are there SNoBs in this Elysium ?” I exclaimed, jumping into
the lavender-perfumed bed. Ponto's snoring boomed from the neigh-
bouring bed-room in reply.
TRENCH's THEORY.
According to the theory of SIR
F. TRENCH, the pedestal of a sta-
tue should be smaller than the
statue itself; which is equivalent
to alleging that the steeple should
be bigger than the church; that is
to say, that the top of St. Paul's
should be larger than the bottom.
If a statue should ever be erected
to SIR F. TrENCH-and there is
really no knowing what the arts
may be reduced to, after the hor-
rible indignities to which they
have been exposed—SIR F. would
of course wish to be placed upon
something more insignificant than
himself. For a man not intrin-
sically great, it may be advisable
that he should be thrown up into
artificial magnitude by placing
him, in all his littleness, upon a
base still more diminutive. We
furnish a sketch, to show SIR F.
TRENch what would be the effect
of subjecting him to that treatment
- which he has so strongly recom-
- * * mended for the Duke of WEL-
LINGTON."

AN astronomical correspondent of the Morning Herald having given
an enlightened account of a meteor which appeared in the metropolitan
heavens a few evenings since, concludes his letter by hoping that any-
body else who may have observed it will communicate the time of
| observation, and the course the meteor took. We have collected a deal
of information upon this subject, which is perfectly at the service of
the above or any other astronomer who wishes to make use of it.
MR. NAPOLEoN SMITH saw the meteor as he was coming out of the
-
Adelphi Theatre. It came from the tail of the lion on the top of
Northumberland House, and disappeared behind the garret-window of
a house in George Street, Adelphi. Cannot be positive about the hour,
but it was somewhere between the burlesque and the farce.
PolicEMAN C. 105, followed the meteor all down Regent-Street. It
disappeared down the area of a house in Cavendish Square, and seemed
to go into the kitchen. Went after it, but could not see it anywhere.
Hour, supper time.
Miss VERY GREEN saw a strong light as she was returning home
from Islington. It shot into the heavens, and then burst into a golden
shower of guineas. Held out her apron, but did not catch any. Asked
what it was, and was told it was an eruption of Mount Vesuvius ;
which Miss GREEN thought was very likely indeed, considering Vesu-
vius is somewhere in the neighbourhood of Rome. Time, the last 'bus
to Barnes. ,
CABMAN, JIM Down Y. Doesn't know muffin about it. Saw somefin
blueish, then reddish, up in the 'evans, but thought it was the fire-
works at Wauxhall, and didn’t trouble 'imself to look agin, as he's
tired seeing on 'em ev’ry night. They cum out of the chimbley of the
Helephant and Castle, and vent he doesn’t know where. Carries no
watch, and doesn't know the time ven he sees it.
We hope the above | stimonies, which we sent out a Commissioner
purposely to collect, w i be sufficiently luminous to support any celes-
tial theory the Morning Herald correspondent may entertain.
THE DEVIL's PATROL.
ON a shiny might, when the stars were bright,
The Devil patrolling had gone,
To visit his large preserves upon earth,
And see how his game got on. -
Through copse and through cover, up hill and down dale,
Proceeded the Evil One :
And under his right arm he bore his long tail,
As a gentleman carries his gun.
And pray what was the Fiend's attire —
Oh, it was that of a sporting 'squire :
His shooting jacket was velveteen,
And his gaiters were brown, and his waistcoat green.
He saw a man seized and sent to gaol,
For snaring a cock pheasant;
And the Devil was pleased ; for, says he, “They'll make
A felon of yonder peasant.”
A keeper, in a game-affray,
He saw shot through and through—
“Hah!” cried the Devil, “that's the way
One shot—one hang'd—makes two.”
As he pass'd the county gaol, he saw
A doom'd man in his cell.
“Ho, hol” the Devil roar'd, “I’m glad
To find that my Game Laws tell.”
And when he beheld each rich estate
Over-stock'd by Preservation,
“All this,” the Devil exclaim 'd, elate,
“Is the fruit of my instigation.”
CONSCIENTIOUS RESTITUTION.
THE Siècle says:—
“The better part of the private fortune accumulated by the late KiNg. Frºpºsanº
was derived from the disastrous Spanish loans, chiefly raised at Paris, and the INFANTA's
marriage portion of 30,000,000 francs comes from the money so amassed to the ruin of
so many Frenchmen.”
And it is further understood—that is, Punch so understands it—that
Louis-PHILIPPE, upon touching the money, will issue a proclamation,
calling together all the original losers, that he may share the reco-
vered cash among them. This will be noble, and so like himself!
GooD NEWS FOR THE SAVANS.
' A Discovery has at last been made of something even more
valuable than the gun cotton of SchoNBEIN. Mrs. Gamp, of Shoe Lane;
has invented a lead paper, with which you may wad your gun and
load it at once, by a single process. The lead paper is sold every
morning, at fivepence per sheet, in the shape of the Morning Herald.

AWEUL APPARITION TO A GENTLEMAN, WHILST SHAviNG, IN THE
Edgware RoAD.—Sept. 29, 1846.
BUNN, THE BIRD-CATCHER.
AMong the many other delightful treats promised by the Poet BuNN
to a British Public, is that of a law-suit with JENNY LINd, “should
she attempt to sing on any other stage in this country.” This reminds
us of a brief dialogue that we heard a day or two since in the shop of a
bird-fancier. It ran as follows –
Customer. I believe, Mister, you import foreign singing birds 2
Bird fancier. I have that honour. Import 'em for the Court and the
aristocracy. I travel every year on the Continent with such a bird-
call that there's nothing with wings can escape me.
Customer. Happy to hear it. Then, of course, you have the very
thing I want.
Bird-fancier. Of course, I have. Anything from a canary-bird to a
cut-throat sparrow. Perhaps, though, you want a German Bulfinch *
Customer. No, I don't. . The bird I want is—a Swedish Nightingale.
[Bird-fancier suddenly looks glum : drops his jaw-stalks into back-
parlour and returns, his right hand grasping something.
Customer. Well, have you got her ?
Bird-fancier (with touching emphasis). At present I have not, sir.
But I pray forget not this. Yes, sir; lay this assurance to your heart;
though I have not the nightingale, I have—behold it (uncloses his hand)
I have the salt, that, should she come in these parts, I'll put upon her
tail, and catch her. Ha! haſ hal
[Laughs hysterically, and rushes back to parlour. Evit Customer, much
impressed.
MOON AND THE MAYORALTY.
It will be seen that in the struggle for the Mayoralty ALDERMAN
Moon got one vote, and it is therefore clear that there is one individual
in the City of London, who is desirous of having Moon as the Chief
Magistrate. His position reminds us of the celebrated Hunt's contest
for Westminster, in whose favour one vote was recorded, namely that
of JERome, a well-known chimney sweeper of the period. Hunt used
to come forward every day—an election then lasted a fortnight—to
thank JERoME for his confidence, and used to add that he, Hunt, was
delighted to find that there was at least one independent and unbought
man in the City of Westminster. The man who voted for Moon
must be a very singular and eccentric character. We should very
much like to know him, unless it happens to be Moon himself, which
is not impossible, for we believe a candidate has the power to honour
himself with his own suffrage.

STATE BULLETINS FOR SPAIN.
Sucu is the alarming condition of Spain, that it would be highly
satisfactory to the rest of Europe if she were regularly attended by
state physicians, who, at brief intervals, should publish official
bulletins of her health; as, for instance—
“6, A.M. Spain has passed a tolerable night, but is slightly troubled
with symptoms of commotion this morning.
“11, A.M. Within the last hour a revolution has broken out in Spain,
but it has been suppressed with a moderate amount of bloodshed; and
for the last five minutes Spain has been tranquil.
“1, P.M. The tranquillity which was restored to Spain at five minutes
to eleven, lasted up to a quarter to twelve, when insurrections began to
manifest themselves in a few provinces; and since that time she has
been labouring under febrile agitation.
“6, P.M. The agitation of Spain continued till four o'clock, when a
remission of symptoms took place; but at five she had a relapse, and
the insurrectionary movements have recurred in paroxysms every
quarter of an hour.
“11 P.M. Spain has just lost a little more blood, which appears to
have relieved her, and for the last ten minutes has enjoyed profound
repose.

“London now is out of town.”-Grimaldi.
He sat alone on his crazy box,
Waiting in vain for a fare;
His skeleton horse, from the ears to the hocks,
Is the picture of despair.
“Cab, your honour,” he calls in vain,
But echo alone replies:
Till “Cab, your honour,” is murmur'd again
In the Zephyr's gentle sighs.
His glaring eyes look wildly round,
He raises his whip on high,
As his features brighten at the sound
Of some lonely passer by.
“A Cab, your honour,” with frantic scream,
The cabman is heard to shout–
But alas ! the man with the milk and cream
Is the only person out.
Even the horse is anxious to go–
Such a wish for work is strange;
But the animal, feeling it fearfully slow,
Would do anything for a change.

The RE is at length a chance that ShakespeARE will be restored to
| his legitimate Temple in Drury Lane. ALEXANDRE DIMAs is trans-
lating what he and JULEs JANIN patronisingly call Le Vieuw Guillaume
into French, and the Swan is being made palatable by the aid of Parisian
Cookery. The objection to his performance in this country will now
be removed, since he will have passed the ordeal of appearance on
the French stage, and has become qualified for re-translation into
the English language.
It is perhaps with a view to some arrangement of this kind, that we
see the names of Risley AND SoNs in the very same programme. As
Hamlet is one of the tragedies of le Vieux. Guillaume—old BILLY-that
ALEXANDRE DUMAs has taken in hand, it is probable that it will soon
he presentable on the English stage in the shape of a Ballet for Drury
Lane theatre, with the following powerful cast of the principal charac-
ters :—Hamlet, by young Risley Laertes, by his Brother. Ghost of
IIamlet's Father by PROFEssoR RISLEY, who will introduce his celebrated
leap off the platform. Ophelia, with the straw dance, by MADEMoiselle
Fi on A FABBR1, who will dance a sort of pas des Moissoneuses in the Mad
Scene, among various trusses of the lunatic's favourite material.
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
M I SS R O B J N so N C R U so E.
CHAPTER XIV.
It will naturally be supposed that, looking upon the new maid that
fortune had so beneficently sent me, my first anxiety was about her
clothes. Animated by the most pleasing feelings, I rummaged all my
boxes, and soon selected a very complete wardrobe. Many things
were, of course, too fine for a servant—it having been instilled into
me as a great principle, by my mother, that servants could not, in her
own emphatic words, be kept “too much under,” and therefore could
not be too plainly drest. If that good woman hated anything, it was
finery in any sort of a maid. She set her face against anything beyond
a penny riband, and would not permit ear-rings, even when they pre-
sented themselves in the modest guise of gold wires, to “dangle from a
servant.” However, in my present condition, nothing remained for me
to choose from but my own wardrobe and the clothes of my fellow-
passengers. Of course I took the shabbiest and the most vulgar.
When, however, I had made the selection, a greater difficulty remained
to be overcome. It was to induce FRIDAY to submit to be thoroughly
drest. She showed an almost unconquerable repugnance to stockings,
putting them on the hind part before, and gartering at the ankle. As
to ever getting her into shoes, I gave up the idea as hopeless ; for
this, however, I cared but little ; as her huge bare feet the better kept
up the due distinction between mistress and maid. Nobody—I was
well aware of the fact—could witness it nevertheless, the circum-
stance was not without its comfort.
iſ shook her head, and placed her two hands to her waist, as much (like
| graphed.”
My greatest difficulty, however, was with the stays. When she
first saw them, and began to feel them all over, and observed that
they contained steel and whalebone—and when further she saw that I
threatened her with them—the poor ignorant creature fell at my feet,
and cried, and, in her way, begged that I would give up so cruel a
notion, as it evidently terrified her worse than death. For some time,
I was greatly amused by the distress of FRIBA: ; but at last, becoming
irritated, I insisted that she should submit to wear the stays ; whilst,
at the same time, I indicated that they were expressly made, and
stiffened with steel and bone, to preserve the beauty of the female
figure. Upon this, FRIDAY, like a poor ignorant savage as she was,
her impudence!) as to say, “Look at me. I never wore stays; and I
am straighter than you.” Now, insºlehee like this would be unbear-
able from anybody; but, coming from a servant, it was much more
than a mistress could put up with. Wherewith, I pointed to the
pistol, with which I had killed the Amazon; and, in a moment,
FRIDAY was at my feet.
Poor benighted creature! How cold she turned, and how she trembled
—for all the world like some poor wretch about to be crushed by
torture—when I compelled her to put on the stays. She evidently
thought that they contained some evil spirits, that would continually
squeeze and punish her—and by degrees consume her blood—and
finally waste her. She could not, poor wretch so express herself;
but I could see by the workings of her mind in her countenance, that
she looked upon the stays as, in former-days, sufferers have looked
upon the steel-boot.
At length, however, the stays were on, and I prepared myself to
lace them. I knew that by doing this I was teaching the first lesson
in civilisation, and felt myself strengthened for the task accordingly.
But shall I ever forget the screams of FRIDAY, as I laced hole after
hole 2 It was plain she felt as nuns have felt—bricked up, as
pleasant histories tell us, for peccadilloes, in convent walls. It was
plain the poor wretch thought she was being laced up for life ; and
this notion, I must confess it, so troubled me that the more FRIDAY
screamed, the tighter I laced, till, in the end, her figure was so unlike
vulgar nature, it almost approached perfection.
When the stays were well laced and fastened, it was droll to see the
perplexity of the poor creature. She would not venture to walk
without laying hold of some support, as if the tightness of the stays
had destroyed the strength and motion of her limbs. When she
looked round, too, she turned her whole body, as if made too stiff to
venture to move her neck. It was clear from the melancholy that
possessed her, that she looked upon herself—poor savage —as a
prisoner for life in walls of whalebone and steel. And will it be be-
lieved ? those stays had been made for a colonel's lady, and had cost
three guineas, if they'd cost a shilling !
After the poor thing had become a little accustomed to her capti-
vity, and could the better understand me, I inquired about the savages
from whom I had delivered her. She told me they were all Amazons.
That they had originally come from the moon, that they worshipped
as a single lady. That they made war upon the women of all married
nations, as creatures who—forgetful of their true dignity in the world,
which was to do entirely as they like—had basely betrayed the inde-
pendence of their sex by allowing themselves to “love, honour, and
obey” brutes, their husbands. And then I asked FRIDAY, what was
the age of the oldest of these Amazons 2 when she informed me that
none of them was ever able to count above five-and-twenty. Lamen-
table ignorance 1
what can be done with it r
As the Wellington Statue must come down, the question shortly will
be “What can be done with it º’ We think we can" answer this
question. The Lord Mayor's procession is due next month: the Statue,
if introduced into it, will give it a new feature, and will look remark-
ably well by the side of the monster figures of Gog and Magog. . It
might be kept expressly for this purpose, and with the twenty-nine
brewer's horses, worked into the procession every ninth of November,
would have the effect of giving a novelty to an absurdity, which for
years past has been getting very stale and unpopular. SIR FREDERick
TRENch, also, might wait upon the Statue in the very natural character
of The Man of Brass, vice GIBBs, discharged.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SINCE the blockade of Westminster Bridge, poor deserted Waterloo
has been reaping quite a harvest of coppers. Its grassy roadway is
now cut up with the wheels of omnibuses, and its arches resound with
the merry echoes of cabmen and costermongers. The toll-keepers are
now familiarly acquainted with the sight of a shilling, and do not start
as convulsively as they did at first when a sixpence was tendered to
them. The dividends must rise tremendously, and if the present run
of luck and vehicles continues, there will probably be a fourpenny-bit
declared at the next meeting of shareholders. Westminster Bridge is
not looking up like its young rival. The two bridges are not unlike
the buckets of a well—as Westminster goes down, Waterloo goes up.
The days "of Westminster we are afraid are, like 'policemen, num-
bered ; and we cannot shut our eyes to the melancholy fact that its
arches are now so old that nothing but “spick span" new ones can
make their tenure on the river a certain one. An offer was made to
the Medical Insurance Office to insure its life, but the directors would
have nothing to do with a bridge which, they said, had one foot in the
grave and the other in the water, though it was only offered as “doubly
hazardous.” The piers of the bridge still maintain their ground, but
as the arches are beginning to tremble for their safety, they are to be
quickly put out of the way, and planks laid down from one pier to
another, for the convenience of foot-passengers. Swimming-belts and
corks will be sold at each end.

nature. For it is the rare privilege of royalty not only to hold its own
heart as nothing, but especially to make light of the hearts of other
eople.

TALES FOR THE MARINES.
TALE THE FOURTH.
RE you, my gallant fellows, are
you fond of goose f Ah 1 per-
haps you can hardly tell ;
you have no geese on your
ship's commons. But still you
have sometimes been on shore,
where you must have found
plenty of geese. It may be,
then, that you have tasted
goose ; and feelingly remem-
ber how delicious it is with
apple-sauce, and stuffed with
sage and onions. Excuse the
emotion which stops the
mouth with the pocket-hand-
kerchief. Well, and about
Michaelmas time you may
have seen, in a tavern win-
dow, an announcement that
within there had been esta-
blished a Goose-Club. Some
of youmay even have belonged
to such a club, at least you
may form some idea of one;
but you have no notion of the
kind of goose-club that I am
Ilow about to describe to you.
This goose-club was established, just before this last Michaelmas, in
the city of London. It is to be feared, Marines, that you are not very
well informed upon certain subjects, and it is therefore necessary to
remind you, that Michaelmas Day is a festival solemnised by all good
people with roast goose ; that is, at least, if they can afford the obser-
vance. Unfortunately, there are many who cannot ; hence the forma-
tion of the City Goose-Club. Its institution was a bright idea conceived
of turtle and iced punch by the brain of the LoRD MAYoR, at a grand
banquet at the Mansion House. It flashed upon his mind simul-
taneously with a glow of radiance darted from a wax candle through a
bumper of claret. Whereupon, his Lordship smote the table with such
violence that all the glasses danced again, and the Aldermen started
with surprise. “A thought has struck me !” exclaimed the LoRD
MAYor. SIR PETER LAURIE was much relieved ; he feared it had
been something more serious. “Gentlemen,” continued his Lordship,
“what say you to a goose-club 7”
“Very good—capital—excellent—just the thing !” replied the
guests, and, smacking their lips, declared that they were the Lord
MAYoſt's men.
“The goose-club I wish to establish,” pursued his Lordship, “is one
on a new principle. Of course,” he observed, laughing, “it will include
ourselves. But it will not stop there. You are aware of the near
approach of Michaelmas Day. We are all of us interested in the proper
observance of Michaelmas. Now, I am sorry to say that there are, in
and about this city, large numbers of persons who pass their Michael.
mas without one thought even of the dish appropriate to the season.
What I propose is, that they should be better taught, and not only that,
but better fed. It shall be their own fault, this year, if they do not pay
due respect to Michaelmas. I allude particularly to the inmates of our
workhouses. So, I say, let us club together, and so form a goose-club,
to enable them to follow our example in the becoming celebration of
Michaelmas Day.”
The Recorder, the Sheriffs, the Aldermen and Common Council,
received this speech with deafening cheers, and each man, flinging
down his guinea, requested to be enrolled in the City Goose-Club.
And so the paupers in all the London workhouses dised on Michael-
mas Day off roast goose; and this is the fourth story that Punch has
to tell—to the Marines.
The Is. 8. ID. Liberator.
THE Statue of O'Connell, by Hogan, has arrived in Dublin. It is
described to be very like the Agitator, and as all accounts agree in
stating that the statue is a fine bit of chiselling, we do not for a
moment doubt the likeness. We propose for the inscription a single
line—“He relieved his Country—of 22,000l. a-year !”
STRANGE OPPOSITES.
SINCE the Statue has been put up, the joke amongst medical students
has been, that St. George's Hospital is now opposite to Guys'.
CURIOSITIES OF MEDICINE.
An advertisement appeared in the Times of the 1st of October which
throws a new and rather a strange light upon the practice of medicine.
The following is the curious announcement to which we allude:—
O the MEDICAL PROFESSION.—w ANTED, by a young man, a
SITUATION as GROOM to a medical practitioner. Has been accustomed to
the routine of a surgery, and understands dispensing. A good character can be given.
Address, post paid, to C. T. C., Mr. , Sexton, C–h 8–t, D–d.
This young man, who is able to combine the duties of the stable with
those of the dispensary, must indeed be a valuable acquisition to a
medical practitioner. A groom who can rub down a horse and make
up a black-draught with equal facility must be a treasure to any
medical gentleman. We presume that, the “routine of a surgery.”
includes the various operations of rolling bread up into pills, and
brewing the “mixture as before” from cheap drugs and pure water.
It is rather ominous that reference should be made to the sexton for
character; but as the young man lived with a doctor, his opportunities
of serving the sexton may create some suspicion as to the perfect impar-
tiality of that individual. We do not wonder that a groom who has
been in the habit of dispensing should have earned the good opinion of
the gentleman who gets his living by grave-digging.
The public must feel considerable alarm at these professional secrets
being divulged, by a groom publicly advertising himself for the double
office of assistant and stable-boy—to look after the horse as well as the
patients. Even if such unions of occupation are common in the
medical profession, it would be as well, for the sake of appearances,
that the odd combination of assistant and groom should not be pro-
claimed thus openly. . We shall henceforth be afraid of any doctor who
keeps a horse, unless he gives us his word of honour that his medicines
are not made up by the servant whose duties are in the stable.
35ulletin of QTije Śtatue.
Tuesday.—The DUKE looks sadly put out by his journey. He trem-
bled violently from head to foot as he approached the arch, and several
byestanders remarked that he would never get over it. He bears up
bravely, however, under all circumstances, considering he has been told
to be prepared for the worst. His doom, it seems, is fixed.
Wednesday.—The DUKE began to stir rather early, though he was not
up before twelve. During the day he gave no signs of improvement,
though the most bracing remedies were used. His circulation has been
very slow. His looks are heavy, and his features are evidently bronzed
with care, by the ELDER WYATT, or else the sun.
Thursday.—The DUKE has passed the night in the most dreadful
suspense. His rest was broken by one of the deal boards which sup-
ported him having given way. The symptoms got worse about six,
and at nine they had reached the climax, when it was expected the
Duke would break down, and be fearfully prostrate. By dint of great
watching, however, and persons sitting up with him all night, the
falling-off, which was universally expected, was luckily prevented.
Friday.—The DUKE is a little firmer to-day, but he looks very
reduced, and has lost considerably by the journey. He looks far from
well, and must undergo a deal of taking down before he will be properly
established. His diet is very strict. The only thing he has been
recommended to take has been a drop of BURTON's Entire.
Property Likely to Fall In.
THE house in Middle Row, Holborn, which fell in some six weeks
ago, still remains in the same disgraceful condition. The remaining
houses have been so shaken by the fall, and are in such a decayed
state, that we are afraid the announcement, which we read in one of the
windows will, before long, be literally carried out. The prophetic pla-
card in question is—“These Premises will be cleared in a few days.”
THE “ARBITER IN-ELEGANTIARUM.”
SIR FREDERick TRENch says the immense size and quantity of metal
in the Statue is only in strict adherence to fact, for he asks most indig-
nantly whether the DUKE is not the Hero of Quatre Brass 2 (Groans.)
TRUE DIGNITY.
A woman, examined last week at the Greenwich Sessions, said—" I
live by hawking. I sell all sorts of netted needle-work to ladies. I
never sold such low things as lucifer-matches l’” Thus, it seems, there
is an aristocracy of hawking—that eschews brimstone !

MR. GEORGE ROBINS
HAs been honoured with the instructions of the landlord, who is in under
an execution for rent, to offer to public competition
ANOTHER LITTLE PARADISE,
comprising what he is fully justified in terming
a love of a Villa,
with all its numerous attractions, which entitle it to the name of the
PET PLACE OF THE COUNTY.
The grounds are not in themselves extensive, but the pleasures of
imagination, so beautifully set forth by the
POET AKENSIDE,
will realise any extent of additional ground that the purchaser may
require as
A VAST FIELD
for the exercise of his fancy. The Villa is placed in the very centre of
a vast manufacturing district, and though it has been said that the
propinquity of a factory is not always agreeable to the ol-factories,
there can be no doubt that in this age of
Free Trade,
it cannot be objectionable to any one to find himself placed amidst the
miraculous
WORKSLIOPS OF BIult ISH INDUSTRY.
The whole is held for a term of years at a ground-rent, which MR.
GeoRGE Robins is justified in calling a mere song, for it consists of
four notes of five pounds, and the lease is renewable at a peppercorn,
which is nominal, as there is
An extensive pepper Mill,
on the premises. Prospectuses, Catalogues, Plans, and other particu-
lars have not been prepared, as MR. GEORGE Robins considers this an
occasion when every one will believe
OCULAR DEMONSTRATION INDISPENSABLE.
Curious Coincidence.
As the Mammoth Statue turned Park Lane, and the feature of the
Duke first came in sight, it was naturally a few minutes before the
remainder of the face was disclosed. At this particular turn, an organ
boy, who must have been hired for the purpose, struck up the tune of
“Jolly Nose.”

And gives the arch a berth full wide.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE SNOBS OF ENGLAND.
BY ONE OF THEMSELVES.
CIHAPTER XXXIII.-ON SOME COUNTRY SNOBS.
oMETHING like a journal of the pro-
ceedings at the Evergreens may be
interesting to those foreign readers
of Punch, who, as CoNINGSBY says,
want to know the customs of an
English gentleman's family and
household. There's plenty of time
to keep the Journal. Piano strum-
ming begins at six o'clock in the
morning ; it lasts till breakfast,
with but a minute's intermission,
when the instrument changes hands,
and Miss EMILY practises in place
of her sister, Miss MARIA.
In fact, the confounded instru-
ment never stops : when the young
WIRT hammers away at those
stunning variations, and keeps her
magnificent finger in exercise.
I asked this great creature in
what other branches of education
she instructed her pupils 2 “The modern languages,” says she modestly.
“French, German, Spanish, and Italian, Latin and the rudiments of
Greek if desired. English of course; the practice of Elocution, Geo-
graphy and Astronomy, and the Use of the Globes, Algebra, (but only
as far as quadratic equations); for a poor ignorant female, you know,
MR. SNoB, cannot be expected to know everything. Ancient and
Modern History no young woman can be without ; and of these I
make my beloved pupils perfect mistresses. Botany, Geology, and Mine-
ralogy, I consider as amusements. And with these I assure you we
manage to pass the days at the Evergreens not unpleasantly.”
Only these, thought I–what an education 1 But I looked in one
of Miss Ponto's manuscript song books and found five faults of
French in four words ; and in a waggish mood asking Miss WIRT
whether DANTE ALGIERY was so called because he was born at Algiers ?
received a smiling answer in the affirmative, which made me rather
doubt about the accuracy of Miss WIRT's knowledge.
When the above little morning occupations are concluded, these un-
fortunate young women perform what they call Callisthenic Exercises
in the garden. I saw them to-day, without any crenoline, pulling the
garden roller.
Dear MRs. Ponto was in the garden too, and as limp as her daugh-
ters ; in a faded bandeau of hair, in a battered bonnet, in a holland
pinafore, in pattens, on a broken chair, snipping leaves off a vine.
MRs. Ponto measures many yards about in an evening. Ye heavens !
what a guy she is in that skeleton morning costume !
Besides STRIPEs, they keep a boy called Thomas, or TUMMUs.
TUMMUs works in the garden or about the pigstye and stable; THo-
MAs wears a page's costume of eruptive buttons, as thus :-
ladies are at their lessons, Miss
When anybody calls, and STRIPEs is out of the way, TUMMUs flings
himself like mad into Thomas's clothes, and comes out metamorphosed
like Harlequin in the pantomime. To-day, as MRs. P. was cutting
the grape-vine, as the young ladies were at the roller, down comes
TUMMUs like a roaring whirlwind, with “Missus, Missus ! there's
coompany, coomin ' " Away skurry the young ladies from the roller,
down comes MRs. P. from the old chair, off flies TUMMUs to change his
clothes, and in an incredibly short space of time SIR John HAwBuck,
my LADY HAwbuck, and MASTER HUGH HAwbuck are introduced into
the garden with brazen effrontery by Thomas, who says “Please SIR
JAN and my Lady to walk this year way: I know Missus is in the rose-
garden.”
And there, sure enough, she was 1
%
In a pretty little garden bonnet, with beautiful curling ringlets, with
the smartest of aprons and the freshest of pearl-coloured gloves, this
amazing woman was in the arms of her dearest LADY HAwbuck.
“Dearest LADY HAwbuck, how good of you ! Always among my
flowers I can't live away from them l’”
“Sweets to the sweet ! hum—aha—haw l’” says SIR John HAw-
Buck, who piques himself on his gallantry, and says nothing without
“a-hum—a-ha-a-haw l’”
“Whereth yaw pinnafaw 7" cries MASTER Hugh, “We thaw you in
it, over the wall, didn't we, Pa 2"
“Hum—a-ha-a-haw . " burst out SIR John, dreadfully alarmed,
“Where's Ponto ? Why wasn't he at Quarter Sessions 2 How are
his birds this year, Mrs. Ponto—have those Carabas pheasants done
any harm to your wheat? a-hum—a-ha-a-haw " and all this while
he was making the most ferocious and desperate signals to his youth-
ful heir.
“Well, she wath in her pinnafaw, wathn't she Ma 7" says Hugh,
quite unabashed ; which question LADY HAwBuck turned away
with a sudden query regarding the dear, darling daughters, and the
enfant terrible was removed by his father.
“I hope you weren't disturbed by the music,” Ponto says. “My
girls, you know, practise four hours a-day, you know-must do it,
you know—absolutely necessary. As for me, you know I'm an early
man, and in my farm every morning at five—no, no laziness for me.”
The facts are these. Ponto goes to sleep directly after dinner on
entering the drawing-room, and wakes up when the ladies leave off
practice at ten. From seven till ten, and from ten till five, is a very
fair allowance of slumber for a man who says he's not a lazy man.
It is my private opinion, that when Ponto retires to what is called
his “study,” he sleeps too. He locks himself up there daily two hours
with the newspaper.
I saw the Harbuck" scene out of the Study which commands the
garden. It’s a curious object, that Study. Posto's library mostly

consists of boots. He and STRIPEs have important interviews here
of mornings, when the potatoes are discussed, or the fate of the calf
ordained, or sentence passed on the pig, &c. All the major's bills
are docketted on the Study table and displayed like a lawyer's briefs.
Here, too, lie displayed his hooks, knives, and other gardening irons,
his whistles, and strings of spare buttons. He has a drawer of endless
brown paper for parcels, and another containing a prodigious and
never-failing supply of string. What a man can want with so
many gig-whips I can never conceive. These, and fishing-rods, and
landing-nets, and spurs, and boot-trees, and balls for horses, and
surgical implements for the same, and favourite pots of shiny
blacking, with which he paints his own shoes in the most elegant
manner, and buck-skin gloves stretched out on their trees, and his
gorget, sash, and sabre of the Horse Marines, with his boot-hooks
underneath in a trophy; and the family medicine-chest, and in a
corner the very rod with which he used to whip his son, WELLEsley
Ponto, when a boy (WELLEsley never entered the “study" but for
that awful purpose)—all these, with Mogg's Road Book, the Gardeners'
Chronicle, and a backgammon board, form the MAJOR's library. Under
the trophy there's a picture of MRs. Ponto, in a light-blue dress and
train, and no waist, when she was first married ; a fox's brush lies
over the frame, and serves to keep the dust off that work of art.
“My library’s small,” says Ponto, with the most amazing induce-
ment, “but well selected, my boy—well selected. I have been reading
the History of England all the morning.”
TALES FOR THE MARINES.
TALE THE FIFTH.
oU have seldom, Marines, an opportunity of reading
the newspapers ; although a considerate Govern-
ment serves out your Punch to you as regularly
as your grog. No matter. You are better with-
out them. They would only mislead you. They
are as full of monstrous fabrications as Baron
Munchausen. There is one fib, in particular,
which they have lately told so often that the
public actually believes it.
You must know that, at this time of the year,
noblemen and country gentlemen, unoccupied
with their parliamentary duties, devote them-
selves to those of their station. A few still
employ their time in shooting ; but the majority
have given up that amusement, together, as you
were informed the other day, with the preserva-
tion of game. The great body of landowners
either I emain on their estates, or go about doing
good ; and among the various labours of benevo-
lence, is that of attending meetings of agricul-
tural societies, which they have established in
different counties, for the promotion of husbandry.
One of the chief objects of these societies is the
reward and encouragement of industrious and well-conducted labourers.
Now the newspapers, almost daily, publish reports of agricultural
meetings; but these reports are so shamefully falsified, that one blushes
even to repeat them. What do you think are the rewards and encou-
ragements which they represent our munificent landlords and generous
farmers as bestowing on their meritorious servants * A pair of boots
to an old man who has lived all his life on seven shillings a week, and
never cost his parish a sixpence 1 A suit of clothes to the father of the
largest family, who has maintained his wife and children on the small-
est earnings I A flitch of bacon—(gammon you will say)—to a carter
or a ploughman, for fifteen or twenty years' good behaviour ! And
these stories the newspapers tell as gravely and coolly as any misstate-
ment was ever made in the House of Commons !
As if noblemen, and gentlemen, and opulent yeomen would think
of recompensing a life of toil and honesty, or a quarter of a century of
heroic endurance on the scale on which they would reward a good boy
at school, or tip a footman or a waiter at an inn. Oh, pooh 1 stuff and
nonsense ! the absurdity is too glaring, even for a joke.
The fact is this : The agricultural societies throughout England
have provided in their respective districts—not an almshouse, no—but
a set of comfortable cottages for the reception of all worn-out labourers
whose wages have been insufficient to enable them to put anything by.
The prizes for industry, economy, and steadiness, consist in nominations
to these cottages, in which board, as well as lodging, is gratuitously
supplied to the inmates. Prizemen, less necessitous, are presented
with a good round sum of money; and as for boots and smock frocks,
sides of bacon, such small quantities are awarded to hard-working,
fellows who have distinguished themselves in some particular hay-
making or harvest. A good fat porker is frequently one of these
rewards of merit; for in point of generosity the agricultural societies
go the whole hog. . They not uncommonly present a stock of baby-
linen to an exemplary mother, or even find a wedding-dress for an
active milkmaid. In short, their object is the creation of a happy
peasantry—“their country's pride;” and they have succeeded in it to
an extent which is absolutely notorious. And this is the fifth story that
Punch has related—to the Marines.
TIT BITS IN “THE MAID OF ARTOIS.”
THIs delicious lyric poem comes back upon us most refreshingly
after a repose of ten years, and the poet has shown, by two or three
additions, that he still retains all the qualities which first won the
hearts and charmed the ears of a British public. In the first scene,
when MR. HARRIson walks in with “a broken fortune and a broken
heart”—his purse-strings and his pericardium being equally snapped
asunder—he informs us that
“If at times the stain of grief upon his cheek appears,
It is because his saddened thoughts find some relief in tears.”
Now this is a piece of poetical licence, for if “the stain of grief upon
his cheek appears,” it is because he has not washed his face after
crying. The poet has a great tendency to talk of the stains made by
tears—a conceit which seems as if he had been nursing his Muse in a
domestic nursery. In his new ballad for Isoline, he tells us–
“Oh what a charm it is to dwell
On long departed years,
E'en though we recollect so well
How stain'd they were with tears.”
What nonsense it is to talk about stains of tears, as if they were stains
of port wine or other indelible marks, when it is notorious that tears
will wash out with wonderful rapidity. This, however, is good—it is in
BUNN's best style:—
“And though their days in fondness nurst
Were yet in sadness past,
For ties that were engendered first
Are those forgotten last.”
Out of pity to this verse, we have some idea of inserting the follow-
ing advertisement in all the papers :—
“Wanted Immediately.—The next of kin to the “days in fondness
nurst.” Any one giving information whose days are alluded to, and
who is meant by their, will hear of something to his advantage.”
We find the poet has not disturbed the magnificent quatrain in
the finale of the first act, which is still retained in all its native sim-
plicity. It is one of those things that BUNN's brain “engendered first,”
and which will decidedly be “forgotten last.” Here it is. Hip, hip !
hurrah
“Away with the traitor :
And never did greater
Involve in his ruin
Another's un-doiu.”
Bravo, BUNN At it again
MILD AS THE MOON-BEAMS.
We have been favoured with a copy of the protest which was sent
in by Mr. Bulwer to the Spanish Government. The tone of it, it will
be seen, is so strong, that we cannot wonder that no answer has been
sent to it. The Spanish Ministry is evidently frightened. i
33ratest of ti) c 33ritish Gudernment.
“The British Government presents its compliments to the Spanish
Government, and requests as a very great favour, that the Spanish
Government will be obliging enough to put off, if possible, the marriage
of the INFANTA LUISA with the Duke De MontPEN.sier. The British
Government begs to congratulate the Spanish Government on the ap-
proaching marriage of the QUEEN of SPAIN, but would be very much
hurt to see the young INFANTA throw herself away on a Bourbon, when
she might do something so very much better. The British Government
presents its compliments to the QUEEN CHRISTINA, and, hoping she is

ALARMING RISE. *
We already knew the DUKE of WELLINGToN was dear to his
country, but we never expected he would rise to such “a very large
figure.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PROGRESS OF A STAR.
n interesting account has been
lately published of the profes-
sional movements of MADAME
ANNA Bishop during a conti-
nental career of some duration.
It is not perhaps generally
known that similar ovations
have been showered upon a
lovely young British vocalist
in her own country. We sup-
press the name, as the mo-
desty of the fair cantatrice, is
very considerable; but we will
give her the pseudonyme of
SIGNoHA THOMSON, in record-
ing her exploits.
SIGNORATHomson exhibited
- a wonderful voice from her
infancy, and she first developed
its power in shouting to her
deaf grandmother. Her first
appearance as a vocalist was, however, at a tea-party given at Isling-
ton by the resident music master. Here she attracted the notice of
the lessee of a tea-garden; and it was resolved that she should go
the whole round of the suburbs.
Her first engagement was at the “Gun,” at Pimlico, where her
success was so decided, that she was asked into the bar every evening,
to take a cup of tea with the landlady. The corporal on duty at the
palace paid her marked attention, and the military vied with each
other in their civilities to the Pimlico nightingale. On one occasion
two of the fifers serenaded her at her lodgings, and every song she
sang emptied a cask of ale, through the consumption caused by the
influx of visitors. -
She next visited Chelsea, where the steam-boat authorities imme-
diately put two of their check-takers at her disposal, for her concerts.
She was most favourably received at the Bun House, and was invited
to several soirées at DoN SALTERo's. After carrying with her several
presents from Chelsea, she went into the interior, and came to Ken-
sington, where she achieved a signal triumph. The churchwardens
instantly placed at her disposal PUMMELL, the beadle, and all his staff,
to deliver her circulars. She gave a concert at the theatre, which was
attended by all the students of the Proprietary School, who filled the
boxes, while the pit and galleries were crowded with the peasantry.
The overseer of Kensington gave her his arm to the omnibus on her
quitting the town, and the sentinels at the corner of High Street
remained on duty during the passing of the vehicle. ,
Her next visit was to Copenhagen-Fields, where she received a
present of a large bunch of Swedish turnips, intended as a hint of her
being quite equal to the Swedish nightingale. She was engaged as
prima donna assoluta for an entire week, and her engagement was
renewed for another week by command of the acting inspector at the
Station House.
disposal during her visit to his district, and helped her on with her
cloak with his own hand, when she finally left the neighbourhood.
On the last night of her engagement she was called to the bar twenty-
five times to receive wishes for her health from different amateurs
among the audience. She sang “Rory O'More” eleven times while
at Chelsea, and “Marble Halls” eighty-six times, from first to last, in
the course of her engagements. She learned “Lucy Neal” in the
original dialect at an hour's notice, and -sang it in the presence of one
of the Ethiopian Serenaders, who threw the fair cantatrice his bones as
a mark of approbation at the end of the first stanza.
Such is a brief outline of the career of SignorA THOMson to the
present time. The future is before her, and will, we hope, give her an
opportunity of proving, from the future, that she is not only perfect,
but pluperfect, or even preterpluperfect, as a British Vocalist.
Correction to be made in all Geographies.
PyRENEes. A chain of mountains which was formerly the boundary
between France and Spain. They were cleared away by Louis
PHILIPPE, in the year 1846, on the occasion of his son's marriage with
the INFANTA LUISA. This gave rise to the French saying, which is
now so popular ln the estaminets of Paris : “Il n'y a plus de Pyrénées.”
* NEW ERA.
We have had several eras; for instance, the Elizabethan era, the
Georgian era, &c. The statue of FIELD-MARshAL THE DUKE of
WELLINGTON will be known, we are afraid, when it comes down, by the
awful name of the F.M.-era (ephemera.)
This functionary placed two of the force always at her
ULTIMATE DESTINATION OF THE STATUE.
Consider ABLE curiosity is being excited as to what can be done with
the DURE's Statue if it is obliged to descend from its present elevated
position. It has been suggested that a grand group might be achieved
by placing it side by side with the Achilles, who might be employed
in holding the DUKE's horse ; for the hero of antiquity has been some
years stretching forth his hand, as if in the attitude of holding a horse
for somebody. No animal has ever yet been found large enough to
admit of his carrying out his accommodating intentions, but the Mam-
| moth horse of the Duke is just about the proper height for the purpose.
If the DUKE is to remain where he is, some support must be found for
him; and perhaps a small group of Peninsular veterans might be intro-
duced appropriately, as having been the parties who raised him to his
very high position.
THE LAST BALLOON OF THE SEASON.
NATURE has behaved very amiably to the aeronauts throughout the
season ; but she seems at last to have been completely tired out by
their impertinent curiosity. She has received every balloon-party with
considerable civility, until the last that started from Cremorne Gardens,
and she seems to have considered that there had been enough visiting
between earth and air for the present. Fearful of that familiarity
that is said to breed contempt, she at length threw a damp upon the
intimacy that was springing up between the two elements, by intro-
ducing a third, in the shape of water. The old adage, that “Two's
company, but three's none,” was never more terrifically realised. Air
and earth got on very well together, but water threw a dreadful damp
upon the warmth of the meeting, and has for the present completely
cooled down the acquaintance. The last balloon accordingly went up
amid thunders of anything but applause, and the car seemed to be
filled with a number of parachutes in the shape of umbrellas. The
veteran GREEN was, to use a venerable pun, on this occasion the
“wetter-un.”
DIFFERENT DEGREES OF GENTILITY.
FonMERLY, any one who kept a gig was called a gentleman.
Now-a-days, anybody, according to the DUKE of LEEDs, who is
acquainted with MR. GRANTLEY BERRELEY is a gentleman.
We must say, we still prefer the old test. We would sooner have a
fi.any day than a gentleman whose argument is “a punch on the
head.'
Queer conceits of Authors.
IN the present day, it seems to be a great point gained by authors to
get novelty in the titles of their productions. The last new advertise-
ment announces the publication of a work to be called Laurels and
Flowers. We have some idea of bridging out a sort of companion, to be
called Gammon and Spinach.

TENDERS FOR THE NAVY.
SINCE the PRINCE of WALEs has been made
a midshipman, the Admiralty has been be-
sieged with nurses and anxious mothers, car-
rying their little charges to be admitted into
the navy. The impression amongst the fair
sex evidently is, that a child cannot be entered
too early on board a man of war; and the num-
ber of babies that have been tendered to the
| Lords of the Admiralty as future LokD NEL-
sons, has been quite awful. One woman pre-
sented herself to the porter at the entrance with
twins, and began her speech with “Please, my
lord, I have brought you two young sailors. I
| wish them, my lord, to be brought up as admirals,
in the same ship as the PRINCE of WALEs.
This one I should like to be a red one, and this
other one, blue. You will see, my lord, I have
put ribbons round their little arms, so that
there shall be no mistake about it.” She was
going on, when the porter interrupted her, by
assuring her that “they were over stocked with
admirals just at present, but he believed they
were in want of such an article at the Chelsea
steam-boats.” The poor woman took up her
red and blue admirals, and went off immediately
at full speed.

PUNCH*S POLITICAL DICTIONARY.
onARCHY. From the Greek words uovos,
alone, and apxa, to govern; meaning the
government of one person. There has
been no English monarch, strictly speak-
ing, since the days of ALEXANDER
SELKIRK, who was “monarch of all he
surveyed ;” but the British Government
cannot be properly called a Monarchy.
The word is sometimes applied ; but
monarchy in England is a species of
compound which may be assimilated to
negus ; whereof the Sovereign is the
lump of sugar, the Aristocracy form the
wine, and the Commons the water,
which in fact preserves the purity and
wholesomeness of the entire mixture.
Monk means literally, one who leads
a solitary life ; but the monks of old
appear to have been the most social set
of jolly dogs in Christendom. The only
remnant of a real monastic existence is
to be found in Vauxhall Gardens, where
the hermit leads the life of a rigid recluse
in the cell appropriated to his residence.
A vow of poverty used formerly to be
taken by all monks, but this is unnecessary with the Vauxhall
monk, who is er officio poor, for a shilling a night is understood to be
the amount of his salary.
Mont DE PIETE (Monte di Pietà in Italian). Literally the
Mountain of Piety: a public institution, equivalent to our own pawn-
brokers' shops, for lending money. These mountains of piety have
very often been plundered and reduced to mole-hills by Governments
in want of money. Pope Pius THE SIXTH, probably by virtue of his
nominal piety, seized upon one of these mountains when pressed by
the French for a contribution to carry on the war against his own and
other governments. This was in the time of NApoleon, who from
his seizing on a slice of everything wherever he went, seems to have
been very appropriately called by the name of Bone-a-part.
MUNICIPAL CoRPoRATION. The corporation of a town ; which may
perhaps have been called the Corporation, from its being, as it were:
the stomach or recipient of all the dinners and feasts paid for out of
the municipal money.
THE DUKE ON A GRAND SCALE.
OUR readers have probably seen those ingenious prints which show
the relative heights of the different monuments of Art throughout the
world, from the Pyramids at Egypt down to the Egyptian Hall, Picca-
dilly. Those engravings will henceforth not be complete without the
introduction of the WELLINgroN Statue, in juxtaposition with the other
vast structures, showing its relation to them in point of magnitude.
The annexed illustration shows us the DUKE in reference to a well-
known and highly-popular Cathedral, backed by an established
Pyramid.
A WeRY GREAT SECRET.
A GENTLEMAN has offered a prize of forty pounds to any one who
will tell him who is at present Prime Minister of England.

PUNCH'S PRIZES FOR INDUSTRY.
As it is the fashion to give prizes to labourers, in the shape of a very small
per centage on the profits they have earned for their masters by extra zeal,
we recommend the plan as a “capital dodge” for being carried into all the
branches of industry.
We recommend its adoption in attornies' offices, and we beg leave to
suggest the following scale by way of a beginning —
| For the copying clerk at fifteen shillings a week, who has been the greatest
number of years, and had the greatest number of children during his
employment in the same office, and has never asked for a rise of salary
on the birth of any one of them, or solicited any assistance
Ten shillings.
For the eldest of three copying clerks at fifteen shillings a week, who
have worked so hard as to enable their employers to get rid of one of
them for the ensuing year, and thus save an entire salary
Five shillings.
Half-a-Crown.
For the second - - - - - - -
The best wishes of his employers.
For the third - - - - -
As it appears to be a common practice to give a shepherd a pound for
rearing the greatest number of lambs in proportion to their flocks, the
attornies might offer to their managing clerks a small annual reward
for the greatest produce of the fleece in proportion to the number of
their clients.
In domestic service also the system would, we are sure, work well, or make
the menials work well, which is after all the grand purpose of all this
liberality. We should suggest therefore—
For the maid-of-all-work, who has been the longest in one place, where the
washing is done at home, and nothing put out but the mistress of the
house, at finding anything neglected . - - Five Shillings.
For the bit of a girl, who has been longest employed at sixpence a-week,
and got through her duties without assistance from the char-
Woman - - A new Testament,
. In fact, the scheme seems to be such a profitable sort of thing to the
givers of the prizes, that we have some idea of rewarding our own sub-
scribers, and just throw out the following by way of “a feeler.” We
propose, then—
- - - - - -
For the oldest subscriber, who has been longest taking in our work and
can produce the handsomest and completest set from the first number

“Now THEN, STUPID 1 "
THE above exclamation, conveying the
strongest indignation, uttered in a
tone of the deepest contempt, is gene-
rally made when one person in the
street runs against another. The
reprimand is so simple, however,
and so beautifully adapted to the
smallest capacity, that, we think, it
might be advantageously used for
more general purposes ; for in-
stance :—
When a gatekeeper in one of the
parks stops a small parcel or turns
“Now then, stupid 1"
A manager, when he talks about
an “enlightened British public, to
whom an appeal is never made in vain,” would invent some-
| thing better if he were invariably stopt by the gallery admonition
of “Now then, stupid l’”
Any young gentleman who goes through the toe-and-heel
evolutions of the Polka, and executes every one of the attitudes
of that intricate dance, might easily be checked by a good-
natured friend quietly saying to him, “Now then, stupid l’.
A hair-dresser, the moment he has said, “Your hair is very dry,
sir : a little of our Cream of Human Kindness would do it a
deal of good, sir,” might gradually be taught better if he always
met with the exclamation of “Now then, stupid l’”
An actor would, in time, give up the antediluvian senti-
ment of “The man who would strike a lovely woman in dis-
tress, &c.," if he were always stopt in the middle by a general
call of “Now then, stupid l’”
The Lord MAYor, also, might probably give up the prac-
|tice of exhibiting himself on the ninth of November in his
gingerbread carriage, if he were received, every year, with uni-
versal cries of “Now then, stupid ''
When a male dancer comes forward to the footlights on his
toes, stands on one leg, gives a sickly grin, and then begins to
kick his legs and throw his naked arms about, the nuisance
might very soon be put down if he were always received with
unanimous shouts of “Now then, stupid "
| When we see a pretty young lady walking out on a wet day
with very thin shoes, we certainly should cry out to her, if it
were not for an innate modesty which stifles the words—
“Now then, stupid l’”
When a fine-whiskered preacher, with white kid gloves, dia-
mond studs, macassar ringlets, and a cambric pocket-handker-
chief, talks in a lisp about the vanity of this world, we must
say we always feel the strongest inclination—only we are awed
by the majesty of the beadle !—to shout out to him—“Now
then, stupid " -
Whenever we see a fresh portrait of HARRIsoN AINsworth,
we always feel inclined to indulge in the same exclamation.
The same desire always seizes us when an Irish gentleman
gets up in the middle of an agreeable party to propose some-
body's health, and in the most sickening nonsense compliments
him to his face.
And lastly, when we see an old man, who ought to know
better, take up the Morning Herald and actually read it, it is
always with the greatest difficulty we can refrain from
shouting out to him—“Now then, Stupid l’”
A Sad Look-Out-
As the DUKE of WELLINGTON was looking the other day
out of Apsley House, and saw the AcHILLEs on one side of
him, and the Monster Statue on the other, he was heard to
sing, in a voice of the utmost feeling,
“How happy could I be with neither
away a velveteen coat, it would do
him no harm to call out to him,

FIFTH FIRST
THE sun shines fair on Neuilly, 'tis past the hour of dine,
Old France and his four royal sons are sitting o'er their wine";
But untasted by the monarch's side bright gleams the Clos-Vougeot,
As he chinks his five-franc pieces, and surveys his sons a-row.
Oh, a wily man is that old king, his whiskers long and grey,
With a twinkle in his eye, that seems “I’m wide awake” to say:
And the smile that plays about his lip is just the smile that suits
The only King in Europe who has polished his own boots.
There sits dark Joinville, with moustaches right truculent of twist,
MontPENSIER, the muffin-faced, NEMOURs the close of fist,
And young D'AUMALE, the fair and flat, a chasseur tight and trim,
And the monarch thought “it’s lucky that I've found a wife for him."
“NEMoURs, thou art mine own true son—small dower thy wife need pay:
By skinning flints and shaving close thou still wilt make thy way;
Joinville I’ve wedded to Brazil, her diamonds and her dollars,
And all save one I've fitted with matrimonial collars.
“There sit two royal maidens in the Escurial towers,
Their hands his prize who mystifies the European Powers ;
By St. Denis, there's one for thee, MonTPEN.sier my boy "
And down with a crack, on his third son's back, came the monarch's
hand in joy!
“For the rival knights TRAPPANI, CobURG, MonTEMoLIN,
DoN FRANcisco, DoN ENRIQUE, I hold them not a pin .
Let who will have HER MAJESTY, we for the INFANTA stand :
There are cases where one bird i' the bush is worth two birds in hand.
“What ho, my squires 1 bring forth my horse, my armour and my
shield I?’
And 'twas rare to see the ancient king how he armed him for the field.
While his four sons gathered round him, each on his bended knee,
And took a lesson from that old Chevalier d’Industric.”
He hath braced his helm of humbug, his breast-plate of untruth,
He hath ta'en his shield of impudence and his lance of little ruth ;
And his sons up to the saddle-tree give him a leg at need,
And proudly paces “Artful Dodge,” his old but trusty steed 1
jutte éetuntſ.
The lists are cleared, the barriers reared, the knights come riding in,
The captive maidens sadly look, for liking is a sin ;
They may not choose, may not refuse, for such their royal parts,
'Tis but their hands are wanted—what need to think of hearts 2
Rides in the van, the pale TRAPPAN, his sword is in its sheath,
The legend blazoned on his shield “I fight"—a cross beneath.
Montemolin, his shield within, displays a crown of brass,
Which his sire DoN CARLos gave him when he found it wouldn't pass.
Next rides CobURG-Cohany, and the QUEEN doth wish him luck;
For, though somewhat out at elbows, he's what ladies call a “duck,”
And he bears the Coburg legend, which his seedy look confirms,
Of “Royal Marriages performed upon the cheapest terms.”
DoN FRANcisco rideth after, looking fain to run away,
Right groggy is he in his selle, and anything but gay:
Follows close bold DoN ENRique, he hath caught the INFANTA's eye,
IIe blows a kiss to her, and she blows him one in reply.

The trumpets sound, the knights ride round, displaying of their paces,
And the ladies gay, they flirt away, displaying of their faces;
When, o'er the barrier of Utrecht, that shuts the lists below,
With lusty leap Louis-PHILIPPE on “Artful Dodge” doth show.
He wears his crown with vizor down, “Hold hard ' " he cries aloud,
“I too will ride a tilt of arms before this noble crowd : ”
And he strikes on PRINCE TRAPPANI's shield, who, the challenge when
he hears
Immediately is taken ill, and straightway disappears.
“Ha, ha! I guess that’s one the less | Now, SIR Conurg, for you.”
And he tipped his lance with gold, for well his foe's weak point he knew;
A rush, a thrust,--a cloud of dust—and when it left the air,
There lay the CoBURG, dead to “time” and much the worse for wear.
“Now rest thee, DoN FRANCIsco, I leave the QUEEN to you,
But, DoN ENRIQUE, there's a crow to pluck between us two.”
And he bent his lance of slander 'gainst that heart so true and leal,
And, with a grin, the stern old king sent home the poisoned steel.
Then silent flowed the tears of those maidens as, perforce,
Each saw her favourite champion sent, as Bell's Life says, “to dorse;”
But nought recked he, the grim Louis, of breaking hearts, or woe:
He’d come to win a wife, and one he'd have before he’d go.
On came MontemoliN, but aye his glance he backward threw,
For the Constable was on his track, as well old Louis knew ;
“Police l’ shouts France, but their approach the Count awaited not,
At first glimpse of the Alcalde he hath bolted like a shot |
The jousts are done, the prize is won, old France has gained the day,
Tho' 'tis in what some folks may call—a dirty sort of way;
And he strokes theneck of “Artful Dodge,” “Well done, thoutrusty steed!
I’ve worked thee hard, but never yet thou'st failed me at my need . "
Right proudly rode he up the lists to where the maidens sat,
And courteously his vizor raised, beneath his broad-brimmed hat,
“Your hands are mine, to pick and choose: FRANcisco, take the QUEEN;
For you, INFANTA, I’ve a son, a gallant boy, tho' green.”
And with a roguish chuckle, as they looked both sad and sour,
He gave those sorry maidens each unto a husband's power ;
And long Madrid shall grumble at the doings of the day
When, with “Artful Dodge,” Louis-PHILIPPE the INFANTA bore away.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THEATRICAL INTELLIGENCE EXTRAORDINARY.
As we are approaching that genial time when so many thousands of
the thoughtless British public begin to think of giving up the vanities
of watering-places—with all their soft, their enervating influences of
--~
_-
donkeys, raffles, and buff slippers as we are nearing November, when
the Catos of Margate shall no longer be called upon to “write a letter
to the Times,” denouncing the giddiness of young ladies who will polk
in their bathing-gowns, to the delight of the frivolous and the agony of
the serious-minded ; when, in a word, tens of thousands of our fellow-
creatures will be returning with their carpet-bags to London, once
more to renew the seriousness of life, as carried out at our principal
playhouses (and, we contend, there are few things more truly serious
than certain comedies, vaudevilles, and farces, as acted by certain com-
panies)—it is to us a very gratifying task to inform the play-going
public, which means all London, that PRofessor FABER has issued a
circular to the Managers of all the theatres ; a circular which certainly
promises to remedy a few of the slight defects that, in the opinion of
the hypercritical, has for a little time existed in various companies.
The Professor proposes to make a troop of actors (upon the same prin-
ciple that he has made his talking automaton), and to let them out to
Managers at so much per week. Thus, in many instances, Managers
will effect a great saving of salaries; and, on the other hand, the public
will, in some respects, be supplied with a better article. The following
are a few of the Professor's charges :—
A Second-Rate—(for the Professor eschews the very first class)—A
second rate, good, substantial tragedy man ; warranted to play
the Ghost in Hamlet, the father in Clari, and indeed, all the “heavy
fathers” in general (paternity, on the stage, being always weighty),
with “a good bould voice,” of one-shilling-gallery power ; fitted
up with double groans, additional heavy sobs, and with the very
best patent windmill action - Per week £4 0 0
A Stout second Old Man; with a perfect splutter; a wheeze, and a
cough of any modulation. Can be fitted up with an asthma at
half-an-hour's notice; and has also a “d—n” of most sonorous
volume. Either walks with the gout when required; or when very
much delighted, or very much enraged, can take up the tails of
its coat in its hands, and dance upon the stage, as though dancing
upon hot iron. Warranted, moreover, not to leave off dancing,
until it has received at least two rounds of applause. Strikes its
stick upon the stage, and cocks its hat with more than the reality
of life . - - - - - . Per week 4:3 0 0
A light Comedian (an article very much wanted), with handsome face,
fine eyes, and extremely white teeth. Has a remarkably fine and
varied gait; now stalking like a camel, and now slipping along
the boards, as though his feet were buttered. An immensely
voluble delivery ; being warranted, if necessary, to play the whole
of Charles Surface in ten minutes with no apparent effort whatever.
Warranted to act three or four parts every night : nothing more
being required than that the prompter should wind him up at the
wing . - - - - . Per week 4.5 0 0
Second Low Comedy (with any dialect from Epping to the Land's
End); a good, stout article, that will face a whole flock of geese,
as though all its life used to 'em. Has any laugh, from the one-
horse-power to the small chuckle; and slaps its breeches pocket
with most convincing energy. For sentimental bits has a beautiful
blubber, and can in two minutes be got ready for a comic song
between the pieces. A really serviceable article. Per week 4:2 0 0
A Comedy Lady ; warranted to act Lady Teazle with a canary-bird
chirp. Can also be adapted to domestic heroines, having a charm-
ing way of cutting syllables (by means of spasmodic mechanism of
the most perfect action) into two, three, or four pieces. Puts its
little hands together in a most affecting manner; and wipes away
the tear from the eye at the necessary points. Has a flourish of
the white pocket-handkerchief that goes to the farthest heart of
the gallery. (If fitted up with extra screams), per week 4:6 0 0
Lady's-maid or Chamber-maid. A capital article; with a laugh like
a ring of bells, and a power of striking the “points" of a part
into an audience, like pins into a pincushion. A wonderful power
of double-entendre - - - - . Per week 4.4 10 0
The automata have this further advantage over flesh and blood
players—that they never refuse their parts; and are always perfect to
the letter in what they undertake. They are also warranted by the
Professor to be kept in constant repair for the weekly salary specified.
Punch cannot inform his readers whether any of the London
Managers have actually acceded to the terms of PROFEssoR FABER;
but, for ourselves, we think them so advantageous, so profitable too,
to a theatre, and in some instances, promising such increased enjoy-
ment to the public, that we hope to be able, in due time, to announce
the appearance of the Professor's troop. -

NAPoleon said there was “but one step from the Sublime to the

Apsley House, gazing at the Monster Statue, it struck us that there
was sometimes the difference of a whole street.
O BE SOLD.—THE BALANCE OF POWER. It is a little out of
order, and requires adjusting, as the beam has been kicked rather severely lately
by one Louis-Philippe, which has thrown the Balance slightly upon one side. A few
English measures are to be sold with it, in the shape of one or two protests, but their
weight is so small that they do not even turn the scale. For further particulars apply
to the British Ambassadors at Paris, or Madrid; and for cards to view, to the Secre-
tary for Foreign Affairs, Downing Street, in whose custody the Balance of Power is
at present deposited.

THE SNOBS OF ENGLAND.
BY ONE OF THEMSELVES.
CHAPTER XXXIV—A WISIT TO SOME COUNTRY SNOBS.
WE had the fish, which, as the kind reader may remember, I had brought down in
a delicate attention to MRs. Ponto, to variegate the repast of next day; and cod and oyster
sauce, twice laid, salt cod and scolloped oysters, formed parts of the bill of fare; until I began
to fancy that the Ponto family, like our late revered monarch GeoRGE IL, had a fancy for
stale fish. And about this time the pig being consumed, we began upon a sheep.
But how shall I forget the solemn splendour of a second course, which was served up in
great state by STRIPEs in a silver dish and cover, a napkin twisted round his dirty thumbs ;
and consisted of a landrail, not much bigger than a corpulent sparrow.
“My LovE, will. YoU TAKE ANY GAME 2 ”
says Ponto, with prodigious gravity; and stuck his fork into that little mouthful of an
island in the silver sea. STRIPEs, too, at intervals, dribbled out the Marsala with a solem-
nity which would have done honour to a Duke's butler. The BARMECIDE's dinner to SHAc-
ABAc was only one degree removed from these solemn banquets.
As there were plenty of pretty country places close by ; a comfortable country town, with
good houses of gentlefolks; a beautiful old parsonage, close to the church whither we went,
(and where the CARABAs family have their ancestral carved and monumented gothic pew) and
every appearance of good society in the neighbourhood, I rather wondered we were not enli-
vened by the appearance of some of the neighbours at the Evergreens, and asked about them.
“We can't in our position of life—we can't well associate with the attorney's family, as
I leave you to suppose,” said MRs. Ponto, confidentially. “Of course not,” I answered,
though I didn't know why. “And the Doctor 7" said I.
“A most excellent worthy creature,” says MRs. P., “saved MARIA's life—really a learned
man ; but what can one do in one's position ? One may ask one's medical man to one's
table certainly ; but his family, my dear MR. SNoB "
“Half a dozen little gallipots,” interposed Miss WIRT, the governess : he, he, he and the
young ladies laughed in chorus.
“We only live with the county families,” Miss WIRT * continued, tossing up her head.
“The Duke is abroad . we are at feud with the CARABASEs ; the RINGwoods don't come
down till Christmas : in fact, nobody's here till the hunting season—positively nobody.”
* I have since heard that this aristocratic lady's father was a livery-button maker in St. Martin's Lane: where he
met with misfortunes, and his daughter acquired her taste for heraldry. But it may be told to her credit, that out of
her earnings she has kept the bed-ridden old bankrupt in great comfort and secrecy at Pentonville; and furnished her
brother's outfit for the Cadetship which her patron, Lord SwiggleBiggle, gave her when he was at the Board of
Control. I have this information from a friend. To hear Miss WIRT herself, you would fancy that her Papa was a
Rothschild, and that the markets of Europe were convulsed when he went into the Gazette.
“Whose is the large red house just outside of
the town 2"
“What ' the chateau-calicot ? he, he, he That
purse-proud ex-linen-draper, MR.YARDLEY, with
the yellow liveries, and the wife in red velvet 2
How can you, my dear MR. SNoB, be so sati-
rical. The impertinence of those people is really
something quite overwhelming.
“Well, then there's the parson, Doctor
CHRYsostom. He's a genuleman, at any rate.”
At this MRs. Ponto looked at Miss WIRT.
After their eyes had met and they had wagged
their heads at each other, they looked up to the
ceiling. So did the young ladies. They
thrilled. It was evident I had said something
very terrible. Another black sheep in the
Church 2 thought I, with a little sorrow ; for I
don't care to own that I have a respect for the
cloth. “I–I hope there's nothing wrong 7”
“Wrong 2 ” says MRs. P. clasping her hands
with a tragic air.
“O !” says Miss WIRT, and the two girls,
gasping in chorus.
“Well,” says I, “I’m very sorry for it. I
never saw a nicer-looking old gentleman, or a
better school, or heard a better sermon.”
|| “He used to preach those sermons in a sur-
|plice” hissed out MRs. Ponto. “He’s A PUSEY-
ITE, MR. SNOB.”
“Heavenly powers 1" says I, admiring the
pure ardour of these female theologians ; and
| STRIPEs came in with the tea. It's so weak
that no wonder Ponto's sleep isn't disturbed by it.
Of mornings we used to go out shooting. We
had Ponto's own fields to sport over (where we
got the fieldfare), and the non-preserved part of
the HAwBuck property ; and one evening, in a
= |stubble of PoNTo's, skirting the Carabas woods,
we got among some pheasants, and had some
real sport. I shot a hen, I know, greatly to my
delight. “Bag it,” says Ponto, in rather a
hurried manner, “here's somebody coming.”
So I pocketed the bird.
“You infernal poaching thieves 1"roars out a
man from the hedge in the garb of a gamekeeper.
“I wish I could catch you on this side of the
hedge. I’d put a brace of barrels into you, that
I would.”
“Curse that SNAPPER,” says Ponto, moving
off; “he's always watching me like a spy.”
“Carry off the birds, you sneaks, and sell 'em
to London,” roars the individual, who it appears
was a keeper of LoRD CARABAs. “You’ll get
six shillings a brace for 'em.”
“You know the price of 'em well enough, and
so does your master too, you scoundrel,” says
Ponto, still retreating.
“We kills 'em on our ground,” cries MR.
SNAPPER. “We don't set traps for other peo-
ple's birds. We're no decoy ducks. We're
no sneaking poachers. We don't shoot 'ens,
like that ere Cockney, who's got the tail of one
a-sticking out of his pocket. Only just come
across the hedge, that's all.”
“I tell you what,” says STRIPEs, who was out
with us as keeper this day, (in fact he's keeper,
coachman, gardener, valet, and bailiff, with
TUMMUs under him,) “if you'll come across, John
SNAPPER, and take your coat off, I’le give you
such awapping as you've never had since the last
time I did it at Guttlebury Fair.”
“Wap one of your own weight,” MR. SNAPPER
said, whistling his dogs, and disappearing into
the wood. And so we came out of this contro-
versy rather victoriously; but I began to alter
my preconceived ideas of rural felicity.

TALES FOR THE MARINES.
TALE THE SIXTH.
NHAPPY Marines, living as you do, mostly on
board ship, it is probable that few of you
have ever seen a Bishop. Large as our nau-
tical population is, it is destitute of episcopal
superintendence. In all the oceans of the
world there is not one see. This is to be la-
mented ; but now the deficiency has been
mentioned, let us hope it will be ere long
supplied. In common, no doubt, with all the
sailors, we should hail a Bishop of Spit-
HEAD. You do not believe this, incredulous
Marines, because your notions of Bishops are
erroneous. You know nothing of them ex-
cept through misrepresentations, in the shape
of penny caricatures. In these, a Bishop is
pictured to you as a kind of monster; a sort of porpoise in human form
and canonicals; with a protuberant stomach and a nose which looks
like an excrescence. You are led to imagine that he does nothing but
eat and drink, and go about catching tithe-pigs, which he carries
away bodily under his arms. Now you must be undeceived upon this
point; it is right, therefore that you should be told what kind of man
a Bishop really is ; and how he lives and occupies himself. One ex-
ample will supply you with a description of the whole bench.
There is a certain Bishop, who has a palace in a large square in
London. The mention of his name will annoy him ; for, like all
Bishops, he does good with the utmost secrecy: insomuch that you
would be astonished if you knew how little is heard of it. The follow-
ing is the manner in which the Bishop spends his day —After an early
breakfast, he sits regularly three hours in his library, giving audience
to all who may want to speak with him ; and receiving reports relative
to the state of his diocese. He has in pay a large number of clergy-
men, whose duty it is principally to go about visiting the lower orders,
in order to ascertain where instruction or relief is needed. For these
wants he makes what provision he can, according to the reports which
he receives ; and when he goes out, after he has finished hearing them,
he accompanies his clergymen, if necessary, in their visits to the poor
and ignorant. This he does generally on foot ; for the supposition that
Bishops roll about in carriages, with a coachman and servants in blue
livery, is a vulgar error, propagated by slander.
By the time the Bishop comes home from going his rounds, it is
generally his dinner-time. You have heard, perhaps, that Bishops
give grand parties, and that their guests are mostly noblemen, and
other great people. This is by no means the fact. The persons whom
our Bishop invites to his table are those who are really in want of a
dinner. Of these he daily entertains a certain number, upon good,
plain, substantial fare. He presides himself, at the head of the board,
and a deacon on his right hand carves for the company. All that is
expected of those who come to dine with him is, that they should be
clean and decent. To enable them so to present themselves, baths and
wash-houses for the classes in question have been established in the
episcopal court-yard, where, also, clean changes of clothes are provided
for them. After dinner, the bishop again retires to his library, where
he remains engaged in study or devotion, till it is time for him to go to
the House of Lords, in which he exerts himself, night after night, for
i. reform of Church abuses, and for the benefit of the labouring popu-
tion.
And this unvarnished account of a Bishop is the sixth story that
Punch has narrated—to the Marines.
The Duke's statue.
SoME people are beginning to express their doubts whether, not-
withstanding all that has been said, the Duke's Statue may not
look tolerably well in its present position. We beg of every one who is
at all disposed to applaud the present arrangement, to refrain from
hallooing till he is out of the wood, which cannot be the case till the
Duke is relieved from the network of scaffolding which environs him.
THE SPANISH MATCH.
El Tiempo does not think that we shall immediately go to war upon
the INFANTA—but will “bide our time.” Or, in other words, that, in
due season, the Spanish match will discharge English cannon.
A safe LINE.

ties Railway the famous line from DANTE – “All who enter here
leave Hope behind.”

A PERILOUS PRECEDENT.
EEL's last pension was one of
twenty five pounds a-year to
John Lloyd, “for services
rendered by his ancestors to
CHARLEs the Second, after
the battle of Worcester.”
We have not the least
knowledge who John LLoyd's
ancestors may have been, but
we hear that they were the
worthy PENDERELL family
who sheltered CHARLEs at
Boscobel, gave him a leg up
into the royal oak, stole
sheep to make him collops,
lent him suits of clothes,
shaved him, and performed
other services which kings
are apt to receive when fugi-
- tive, and to forget when re-
stored to the throne. The
worst of this precedent is,
that ever since John Lloyd
received his first quarterly
4.6 5s, the Treasury has
been besieged with people
whose ancestors have been
of service to royalty at remote periods.
There is, for example, the great-great-great-great-great-great-great-
great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-
great-great, &c., grandson of the celebrated neatherd of Athelney,
whose wife rebuked His MAJESTY ALFRED THE GREAT, for letting the
cakes burn—a circumstance familiar to all frequenters of our cartoon
and picture exhibitions. It is a current tradition in this interesting
family, that the (great-great, &c.,) thirtieth grandfather, the neatherd
in question, was wont to say—“Ah! I found His Majesty in board,
lodging, and washing, for a matter of six months, and never saw the
colour of his money. His Majesty was never worth his salt.—God
bless him l’”
His descendants have applied for a pension “for expenses gone to by
their ancestor for his late Majesty ALFRED THE GREAT, A.D. 879, at the
rate of 18, a day for board and lodging, with arrears of interest.” The
pension claimed amounts to £40,000 per annum.
Another claimant is the (great-great, &c.) seventeenth grand-nephew
of BloNDEL, the minstrel, who discovered the prison of Richard
CoEUR-DE-Lion, A.D. 1193. This claim runs, “To expenses of a pro-
fessional tour undertaken by MossIEUR BLoNDEL, harpist to their late
Majesties KING RICHARD THE FIRst and QUEEN BERENGARIA, for the
purpose of finding cut His Majesty's place of confinement, and to loss
on concerts given in small towns (where it was impossible they could
pay) for that patriotic purpose.” The amount of the bill is trifling
as compared with the present rates of payment to harpists, fiddlers,
foreign singers, &c.—about £5000.
Another set of very clamorous claimants are the representatives of
the celebrated robber who protected the children of Her Majesty
QUEEN MARGARET of ANJou, A.D. 1461 ; a subject often embodied by
our painters. This is a collateral branch, the direct line, who con-
tinued the precarious profession of the founder of the family, having
been all hanged or transported. This branch, however, went early
into the law, and the present representative is a well-known sharp
practitioner, in Red Lion Square. He declares his intention of bringing
an action on Assumpsit, for “work and labour,” if his claim is not
immediately settled.
Then we have the descendants of the gentleman who helped Richard
THE THIRD to a horse at the Battle of Bosworth Field, having stolen
the animal for the purpose, in reliance on Rich ARD's rash promise
to give “his kingdom” for the quadruped ; for which he received
nothing whatever, and narrowly escaped hanging from HENRY THE
SEventh.
There is also a demand on account of the tailor who made KING
STEPHEN's breeches, at the low charge of five shillings. He was the
Moses of his day, and SHAKspeARE is an authority for the fact of his
having supplied the royal pantaloons, and their ridiculously small
price, in the well-known lines—
“King Stephen was a worthy Peer,
His breeches cost him but a crown;
He held them sixpence all too dear—
With that he called the tailor, loon.”
The present claimants declare, in accordance with this, that His
Majesty offered 48.6d, and when this was refused, on the ground that
6d. discount for ready money out of 5s. was excessive, abused their
ancestor in the most ungentlemanly manner; but ended by giving him
- stolen some years since
(it is suspected by Government), and is believed to be now concealed
in the Record Office.
In fact, this pension to John Lloyd is likely to involve the Govern-
ment in very heavy responsibilities; as it establishes the principle that
the Statute of Limitations does not apply to services rendered to
Royalty, though it does to all other private claims on the Government,
as was laid down in the case of the late BARon De Bode.
an “I.O.U.”for the amount, which was meanly
THREATENED INTERREGNUM IN THE CITY.
The great difficulty of finding a fit and proper person to fill the
office of Lord Mayor, becomes more alarming every year, and it is
positively beginning to be a matter of doubt whether the Mayoralty
will not become extinct for want of some eligible person to succeed to
the dignity. We think it would be much more for the credit of the
City if the Civic Crown were descendible generally to any of the
citizens, without being entailed upon the Court of Aldermen as
every year, seems to threaten the horrors of anarchy through there
being no eligible person to ascend the throne of the Mansion House,
we beg to propose that the difficulty shall be met in future by a timely
advertisement inserted in all the newspapers, to the following effect:--
W ANTED–A Person with tolerably clean hands, to fill the Civic chair for
one year, at the usual salary. A slight tinge will not be objected to, but no one
need apply who has received money to apply to a particular purpose, and has failed
in doing so. Parties having trust-money in their charge will not be objected to on
the ground of their not having furnished an account, unless an application has been
made, in which case their claims cannot be taken into consideration; but a pre-
ference will be given to really honest men.
LUNAR PHENOMENON.
- - =
WE have received the following letter, purporting to come from the
Astronomer Royal at Greenwich. The subject of complaint is, it will
be seen, the celebrated monster grievance at Hyde Park Corner —
“MR. PUNCH, “Observatory, Greenwich.
“As I was taking a sight at the moon in my usual manner
through my gigantic telescope, to the top of which I had crawled and
thrown up the glass at the end that I might see the clearer for having

PUNCH, OR THE
ROYALTY SNUBBED.
WE think we were the first to
point out the great impropriety of
snubbing some of the minor kings
who have paid a visit to this country.
Saxony was tolerably ill-used, but
poor Holland was really left to run
about—
Without a mark—without a bound,
Threading the wide world round and round;—
without even the attendance of a
policeman to tell him his way
through the streets of the metro-
polis.
This treatment has evidently not
been forgotten by Holland, who, we
find from the foreign correspondent
overflowing with indignation, after
the coldness which the British Court
displayed towards him last summer.”
The result is, that Holland is running
insult offered by France to England,
in the matter of the Spanish mar-
riages. It is true that his Dutch
Majesty was a little unreasonable
to come over to London when every-
body was out of town, for he could
scarcely expect a season to be got up
expressly for him at the conclusion
of all the metropolitan gaieties. If
illustrious visitors will come at un-
seasonable times, they must e
a little snubbing. Still we think

more might have been done to put
Holland in good humour.
AMong the new fashions for the ensuing season will be found a head-
dress adapted to the use of a prima donna when called before the cur-
tain in the course of one of those ovations which are now as “plentiful
as blackberries.” It is to consist of a basket, of light and elegant
fabric, but capacious dimensions, calculated to receive a plentiful
shower of bouquets, and rendering it unnecessary for the artiste to
take the trouble of picking up the floral gifts, or leaving any behind
her on the stage, which she is now frequently compelled to do through
having nothing to put them in. A very graceful and at the same time
a very convenient addition to the toilette would be achieved in the
manner we have described ; and we recommend the manager of Drury
Lane to have one manufactured as an experiment. It could be kept as
a sort of “property,” and fastened with a porter's knot on the head of
any vocalist or dancer as occasion required.
DUMAS ON THE SPANISH MARRIAGE.
Louis-PHILIPPE—like Moses AND SoN —has retained a poet.
of the Times, “returned to his states,
about in a state of delight at the
M. DUMAs, it is well known, received orders to write fourteen volumes
octavo on the Spanish marriage. All the world knows the fearful
rapidity of ALEXANDRE's pen. He writes with an eagle's quill, that
flies, at least a hundred miles an hour, over so many miles of foolscap.
This time, however, he has laboured somewhat lazily; hence, he has
finished only the twelfth volume of his work. But this, however—for
it is not to be supposed that DUMAs would confine himself to the mere
details of the marriage—brings the work to the second year of the
English war with France and Spain; MonTrensier being at Cadiz i
with QUEEN LUISA and their three sons and two daughters—the eldest
son, the INFANTE FERDINANDo, though only sixteen, having, in single
combat, killed the DUKE of WELLINGTON (the present MARQUIs of
DouRo), and taken prisoner and shut up on bread and water the heroic
but unfortunate Lord CHARLEs WELLESLEY. As Englishmen, our
anxiety will, we hope, be pardoned, to come to the end of the last
volume.
The Ant-Plague at the West End.
WE have seen a paragraph in the Morning Post, stating that several
of the houses at the West End are infested with ants, which get into
every hole and corner of the premises. We believe that an Anti-Ant
Association is about to be formed, for the purpose of getting rid of
these very troublesome visitors. A house crowded with ants must be
almost as bad as an establishment swarming with country cousins.
PUTTING DOWN WOOD IN THE CITY.
THE friends of ALDERMAN Wood declare he was rejected by the
City because he had no fortune. Hence the old proverb, we suppose,
of—“It’s money makes the mayor to go.”

OMNIBUS OPINIONS OF THE WELLINGTON
STATUE.
N truth SIR FREDERICK TRENch may
laugh at the scorners. The Omnibuses
with him—what cares he for other op-
ponents He is strong as a captain
of a hundred chariots. Little by little
has the Duke developed himself—little
by little, like Harpagon the miser,
has WELLINGTON, from his scaffold,
lugged out his coppers. Nevertheless,
the Omnibus drivers and conductors,
with eyes well educated to detect the
meaning of a whole from the position
of a part—as , for instance, when an
old gentleman lifts up only his fore-
finger, they know he wants a lift for
his whole anatomy—did, some days
before the Statue was exposed (and
such a public exposure never yet came
before magistrate), arrive at a deter-
mination upon its beauties. In a word,
the West-end Omnibuses are, to a
wheel—if we may be allowed the
figure, and if not we shall use it—very proud of the Duke upon the
Arch. Something of this pride they may owe to their loyalty. For
the reader must remember that an illustrious somebody (for we have
no time to recollect who it was) in the House of Commons insisted
upon the Luke's mounting the Arch because HER MAJESTY anticipated
her delight at seeing so great a man—as the first and greatest subject
—when she drove from her Palace.
Now the Western Omnibus drivers and conductors, though they may
not analyze the emotions, admire the Statue, inasmuch as it fills them
with a morning draught of glory. Men from Brentford, and Richmond,
and Ham-mersmith, and Fulham, and Chelsea, like the Arch all the
better for the lump of metal adorning it; and with a frankness quite
characteristic of the men, they have registered their opinions. The
Statue having avowedly gone upon the Arch—as boys go behind coun-
ters—upon trial, SIR FREDERICK TRENCH is justified in feeling very
proud of the document that has just been forwarded to him—(and of
which, with his known politeness towards Punch, he has favoured us
with a copy)—a document that proves the perfect satisfaction of a very
large body of men, most likely to be pleasurably affected by the Statue
of a fine thing finely placed—as, on the contrary, they would have been
equally distressed if coming upon them in the shape of a brass counter-
feit—a big nuisance. For the present we shall substitute the name of
the vehicle for the signature of the driver and the conductor. We,
however, pledge our reputation to the unanimity of these.
OMNIBUS OPINIONS.
“WE have watched the Duke and his Horse as they have struggled
out of the wood ; and, allowing that the winter will, in course, take all
the shine out of 'em, we nevertheless have nothing to say agin 'em.

seem to clip the horse no how, and looks as if a high wind would blow
him off. This dreadful accident, however, might be prevented if the
Duke was made fast to the saddle by copper-braces. Howsomever, we
have no objection to risk the Duke as he is, if he hasn't.

These opinions, very handsomely engrossed and beautifully illustrated
upon a virgin piece of ass's-skin, have been forwarded to SIR FREDE-
Rick TRENCH. He was, as it may be supposed, much affected by the
testimonial ; and, thanking the parties, pressed the document to his
bosom with extraordinary animation.
REWARDS FOR AGRICULTURAL LABOURERS.
SoME objections have been made to the practice of giving an agri-
cultural labourer an extra pound or two, in the shape of a prize for a
service of thirty years upon low wages. SIR E. CLAYTON EAST, at an
agricultural dinner at Macclesfield the other day, put the matter quite
in a new light, and proved that the value of the prizes had been fear-
fully underrated. He said it was not the money which formed the
worth of the prize, but the fact that every poor man rewarded by an
Agricultural Society got with his few shillings “the good wishes of
every subscriber to the Association.” It is a pity that these “good
wishes” are not current in any market. A bank ought at once to be
opened, where they could be exchanged, if they are to be of any value
to the labourer. Some plan might, perhaps, be adopted, for giving him
his prize half in cash, and half in compliments; instead of ninety-nine
per cent. of the latter to only one per cent. of the former, which is now
the average proportion of the materials forming his reward. Good wishes
are very well as garnish to a gratuity, but they ought never to form
the principal ingredient. It is like putting a small, thin slice of meat
into a dish elaborately trimmed with parsley. If the agricultural
labourers are to take out the greater part of their rewards in good
wishes, they should be allowed the privilege of giving a portion of their
services in the shape of good intentions.
We understand that SIR E. CLAYTON EAST intends giving the follow-
ing two new prizes at the next meeting at Maidenhead :—
To the labourer who has lived the longest number of years on the
shortest commons, one pound.
To the second labourer, the wishes of the Association—that he may
get it.

SoME curiosity is being expressed as to what will be done with the
money subscribed for the HUDsoN Testimonial. As equestrian statues
in the neighbourhood of the homes of the originals are all the rage, we
should propose that a statue, of a modified equestrian character, should
be raised across the houses at the Albert Gate, so as to form an arch in
honour of KING HUDson. This arrangement would in some degree
prepare the stranger entering London by Knightsbridge for the mon-
strosity that would otherwise burst unexpectedly upon his sight on
arriving at Hyde Park Corner, and be entirely in accordance with SIR
F.TRENCH's notion “that extraordinary persons should occupy extra-
ordinary situations.”

“Knightsbridge, October 20, 1846.
N- F course, dear Mr. Punch, I don't pry into other

gentlewoman, and I flatter myself I am of that
order.

horrid men, and that I can't walk the street but in daily terror.

AN elderly female, who was understood to have seen better days, was
charged with throwing stones, and making a noise outside the Punch
Office. The poor creature, who was still very much excited, gave the
name of Gamp. It appeared from the evidence of the policeman, that
the prisoner was seen to come out of a house in Shoe Lane, and to
make direct for Fleet Street. On arriving opposite to the Punch Office,
she became furious, and after using some very bad language, tried to
break the window with her umbrella. The policeman seeing the state
she was in, gently advised her to move on ; but as she refused, and
began appealing to the few persons who had collected round her—all
of . were laughing at her—he thought it better to take her into
custody.
The prisoner, on being asked what she had to say in her defence,
became exceedingly garrulous, and produced a printed paper, which
she said contained an epigram that would explain everything.
The magistrate, glancing over the epigram, which was eighty-six lines
in length, said he could not make either head or tail of it. Mrs. Gamp
was proceeding in a strain of rambling incoherence, when the magistrate
perceiving the state of the poor old creature's intellects, inquired if any
one was present to press the charge. Being answered in the negative,
he dismissed her with a gentle caution. The unhappy old woman left
the Office mumbling to herself something which she called an epigram.
Her pitiable state seemed to excite the compassion of the bystanders.
PUNCH'S NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.
* THE annual retirement of Captains from the Chelsea steam-boats
will commence on the 1st of November. The six eldest officers of the
squadron will be superannuated as check-takers, and the three next
will enter the Preventive Service, to prevent passengers from going on
board before they have paid their money. The Polyanthus is to be
immediately dismantled, and put out of commission. Her funnel has
been taken out, and placed high and dry in the back attic at the Cap.

chain of her tiller is to lie in a soak of salad oil until next summer.
EXTRAORDINARY MONOMANIAC.
A FEw days ago, WILLIAM Ford, an engineer, was charged at the
Southwark Office with endeavouring to force his way into the Victoria
Theatre 1 The magistrate, remarking that the act betrayed an alarming
symptom of insanity, ordered the man to be looked after.
“MERRY ARE THE BELLS.”
SIR. S. G. Osborn E, who has dealt such “swashing blows” upon
sundry Poor-Law functionaries, among other doings exposed the
“agriculturists” of Ryme, accustomed to feed their bold peasantry
on diseased cattle. The agriculturists, however, claimed the victory;
and “so pleased were they with themselves, that some men were sent
to ring the church bells.” Now, certainly, if we consider their long and
various history, church bells have been made to cry “gladness” and
“victory” with most lying tongues. Indeed no metal—not even that
of brass ordnance—has, in its time, given voice to greater injustice
than bell-metal. Only think, for instance, of the bells that, from
Madrid steeples, have within these few days been made to cry—
“Welcome, Son of France 1” when the sounds truly interpreted were—
somewhat like the voices from the Steeple of Bow—“Turn again,
MonTPENSIER 1" . But to leave the bells that lie about kings and
princes, for the bells that proclaim the humanity, the victory of the
agriculturists of Ryme ! Certain farmers coerce the stomachs of their
labourers to receive carrion, paying so much per pound for it; and the
villany is discovered—made manifest to the world—protested in
evidence by the partakers of the diseased food. But weak is moral
force against bell-metal ; small and poor is human utterance drowned
in triple bob-majors l The cows did not die of disease, but were law-
fully knocked down by pole-axe ; the calf came not to a natural
death, but was duly killed by hired butcher. And you, SIR S. G.
OSBoRNE, still deny it 7 Why, listen, to the iron tongues of truth,
clauging victory from the church steeple ! Never was cattle so
honoured. What, we ask, are the glories, the triumphs of the bull-
fights of Spain, to the dead cow contests of Merry England 2 The
cow dies of disease—is eaten by the English peasant—and its memory
honoured by the ringing bells of Ryme steeple ! A new and unex-

THE SNOBS OF ENGLAND.
BY ONE OF THEMSELVES.
CHAPTER XXXV.-ON SOME COUNTRY SNOBS.
E hanged to your aristocrats' " Ponto said, in some
conversation we had regarding the family at Ca-
rabas, between whom and the Evergreens there
was a feud, “When I first came into the County
—it was the year before SIR John BUFF con-
tested it in the Blue interest—the MARQUIs,
then Lord St. Michaels, who, of course, was
Orange to the core, paid me and MRs. Ponto
such attentions, that I fairly confess I was
taken in by the old humbug, and thought that
I'd met with a rare neighbour. 'Gad, Sir, we
used to get pines from Carabas, and pheasants
from Carabas, and it was—“Ponto, when will
you come over and shoot ?'—and—‘PoNto, our
pheasants want thinning,'—and my Lady would
insist upon her dear MRs. Ponto coming over
to Carabas to sleep, and put me I don't know
to what expense for turbans and velvet gowns
for my wife's toilette. Well, Sir, the election
takes place, and though I was always a Libe-
ral, personal friendship of course induces me to plump for St. MI-
cHAEL's, who comes in at the head of the poll. Next year, MRs. P.
insists upon going to town—with lodgings in Clarges Street at ten
pounds a week, with a hired Brougham, and new dresses for herself
and the girls, and the deuce and all to pay. Our first cards were to
Carabas House; my Lady's are returned by a great big flunky; and
I leave you to fancy my poor BETsy's discomfiture as the lodging-
house maid took in the cards, and LADY ST. Michaels drives away,
though she actually saw us at the drawing-room window. Would
you believe it, Sir, that though we called four times afterwards those
infernal aristocrats never returned our visit ; that though LADY ST.
Mich AELs gave nine dinner-parties and four déjeuners that season, she
never asked us to one; and that she cut us dead at the Opera, though
BETsy was nodding to her the whole night. We wrote to her for
tickets for ALMAck's; she writes to say that all hers were promised ;
and said, in the presence of Wiggins, her lady's-maid, who told it to
Diggs, my wife's woman, that she couldn't conceive how people in our
station of life could so far forget themselves as to wish to appear in
any such place : Go to Castle Carabas I’d sooner die than set my
foot in the house of that impertinent, insolvent, insolent jackanapes—
and I hold him in scorn 1 " After this, Ponto gave me some private
information regarding LoRD CARABAs's pecuniary affairs; how he
owed money all over the County; how JUREs the carpenter was
utterly ruined and couldn't get a shilling of his bill; how Biggs the
butcher hanged himself for the same reason ; how the six big footmen
never received a guinea of wages, and SNAFFLE, the state coachman,
actually took off his blown-glass wig of ceremony and flung it at LADY
CARABAs's feet on the Terrace before the Castle ; all which stories, as
they are private, I do not think proper to divulge. But these details
did not stifle my desire to see the famous mansion of Castle Carabas,
may, possibly excited my interest to know more about that lordly
house and its owners.
At the entrance of the park, there are a pair of great gaunt
mildewed lodges—mouldy Doric temples with black chimney-pots in
the finest classic taste, and the gates of course, are surmounted by the
Chats bottés, the well-known supporters of the CARABAs family.
“Give the lodge-keeper a shilling,” says Ponto, (who drove me near
to it in his four-wheeled cruelty-chaise), “I warrant it's the first piece
of ready money he has received for some time.” I don't know
whether there was any foundation for this sneer, but the gratuity was
received with a curtsey, and the gate opened for me to enter. “Poor
old porteress " says I, inwardly, “You little know that it is the
Historian of SNoBs whom you let in 2 The gates were passed. A
damp green stretch of park spread right and left immeasurably, con-
fined by a chilly gray wall, and a damp long straight road between two
huge rows of moist, dismal lime-trees, leads up to the Castle. In the
midst of the park is a great black tank or lake, bristling over with
rushes, and here and there covered over with patches of pea-soup. A
shabby temple rises on an island in this delectable lake, which is
approached by a rotten barge that lies at roost in a dilapidated boat-
house. Clumps of elms and oaks dot over the huge green flat.
Every one of them would have been down long since, but that the
Marquis is not allowed to cut the timber.
Up that long avenue the Snobographer walked in solitude. At the
seventy-ninth tree on the left-hand side, the insolvent butcher hanged
himself. I scarcely wondered at the dismal deed, so woful and sad
were the impressions connected with the place. So for a mile-and-a-
half I walked—alone and thinking of death.
I forgot to say the house is in full view all the way—except when
intercepted by the trees on the miserable island in the lake—an
enormous red-brick mansion, square, vast, and dingy. It is flanked
by four stone towers with weathercocks. In the midst of the grand
façade is a huge Ionic portico, approached by a vast, lonely, ghastly
staircase. Rows of black windows framed in stone, stretch on either
side, right and left—three stories and eighteen windows of a row.
You may see a picture of the palace and staircase, in the Views of
England and Wales, with four carved and gilt carriages waiting at the
gravel walk, and several parties of ladies and gentlemen in wigs and
hoops, dotting the fatiguing lines of the stairs.
But these stairs are made in great houses for people not to ascend.
The first LADY CARABAs, (they are but eighty years in the peerage) if
she got out of her gilt coach in a shower," would be wet to the skin
before she got half way to the carved Ionic portico, where four dreary
statues of Peace, Plenty, Piety and Patriotism, are the only sentinels.
You enter these palaces by back doors. “That was the way the CARA-
BAses got their peerage,” the misanthropic Ponto said after dinner.
Well—I rang the bell at a little low side-door ; it clanged and jin-
gled and echoed for a long long while, till at length a face, as of a
housekeeper, peered through the door, and, as she saw my hand in my
waistcoat pocket, opened it. Unhappy, lonely, housekeeper, I thought.
Is Miss CRusoe in her island more solitary 2 The door clapped to,
and I was in Castle Carabas.
“The side entrance and all,” says the housekeeper. “The halliga-
tor hover the mantelpiece was brought home by HADMIRAL St. MI-
CHAELs, when a Capting with Lord HANson. The harms on the
cheers is the harms of the CARABAs family.” The hall was rather
comfortable. We went clapping up a clean stone back-stair, and then
into a back passage cheerfully decorated with ragged light-green kid-
derminster, and issued upon
“THE GREAT ALL.”
“The great all is seventy-two feet in lenth, fifty-six in breath, and

me. I should go mad were I that lonely housekeeper—in those
enormous galleries—in that lonely library, filled up with ghastly folios
that nobody dares read, with an inkstand on the centre table like the
coffin of a baby, and sad portraits staring at you from the bleak walls
with their solemn mouldy eyes. No wonder that CARABAs does not
come down here often. It would require two thousand footmen to
make the place cheerful No wonder the coachman resigned his wig,
that the masters are insolvent, and the servants perish in this huge
dreary out-at-elbow place.
A single family has no more right to build itself a temple of that
sort than to erect a tower of Babel. Such a habitation is not decent
for a mere mortal man. But after all I suppose poor CARABAs had no
choice. Fate put him there as it sent NApoleon to St. Helena.

the Park—I shall have a much tenderer interest in these great people
than I have had heretofore. Poor old shabby Snob Ride on and

STREET ARCHITECTURE.
* I L II
ºś
A sagacious Correspondent, of our edifying contemporary, The
Builder, complains of being put sadly out of spirits by the depressing
influence of our Street Architecture. Dull uniformity sends him into
a fit of melancholy for a whole morning's walk, and an unsightly
chimney casts him down into the lowest depths of utter despondency.
In order to promote the gaiety of himself and other hypochondriacs, it
has been proposed to enliven our Street Architecture by pantomimic
groups, in the style of the Illustration that accompanies these observa-
tions. Of course, the mode of producing cheerfulness might be varied
in different neighbourhoods; but a few streets of Harlequins, Pantaloons,
and Clowns might be tried by way of an experiment for enlivening our
Street Architecture.
Mathematical Intelligence.
A correspondent writes to know what is the meaning of the Pons
Asinorum. We are not quite sure whether it is Westminster Bridge or
Hungerford. From the difficulty of getting over the Pons Asinorum we
should say that Westminster Bridge must be the bridge alluded to.
PUNCH*S PRECIOUS LAND LORD.
GREAT is the blessing of a good landlord to his tenantry at all times.
Doubly great the blessing of such a landlord in Ireland. Trebly great
of such a landlord in Ireland, at the present terrible crisis.
Honour and laud, then, to MR. Evelyn John SHIRLEY, M.P., one of
the largest proprietors in the county of Monaghan 1
The poor on his large estates are starving. His tenants, in dismay
looking round for help and comfort, bethink them of their landlord.
He does not live amongst them, so they write to him—such a letter we
may presume, as impending starvation wrings from shrinking hearts,
asking for succour in their emergency. MR. SHIRLEY sends back—
money himself with his means and experience —a cargo of meal 2
—directions to his agent to set the poor to work —a remission of rent
to the sufferers ?–No : but a letter of advice—and such a letter 1
Coolness is invaluable at such a moment of terror. This letter is
certainly the coolest we ever remember to have read ; we must give it
entire, with our own italics.
“To The TENANTRY of the shinley Estate.
“September 15.
“My Friends and Tenants, Application having been made to me by some of you on
the subject of the existing distress and alarm caused by the failure of the potatoes, I take
this method of stating my opinion and advice on the occasion.
“It becomes the duty of all classes, under this affliction of Divine Providence, to
exert themselves to alleviate the distress occasioned by the awful dispensation; the poor
to exert their patience and to calm their fears; the rich, to aid in devising the best plan
to secure food for those whose means will soon be exhausted. The Government is ready
and willing to assist in the good work; and grants of money are making, under certain
regulations, to enable proprietors and landlords to employ those in want of work ; and
thus all such will have means to provide for their families. The larger tenants must take
care of their cottiers, and supply them with money or meal, in lieu of their potatoes;
thus, the burden will be divided, and all will bear a share of the general calamity.
“Meanwhile, let the tenantry take advantage of the blessed weather, by increased ex-
ertion in securing, threshing, and selling their corn while the market is high, and paying
their rent, aiding the landlord to help the distressed. Thanks to a merciful God, the
corn is in a good condition, well saved, no wind to shake it out, no wet to injure it; the
hot sun we are blessed with must be beneficial to the potatoes.
“Let us by cheerfulness and firmness soothe the timid and encourage the active and
industrious ; remeubering that this affliction is intended as a tral for our good, and
must be borne with resignation to the Divine will. But above all things aroid the counsel
of thos- bad men, who, with their rents in their pockets, delay in paying it, while they
| endeavour, for their own selfish purposes, to increase the alarm in the minds of the poor
and weak. If such should be found in Farney, let them beware; for, if detected, neither
their wealth nor their station shall secure them from the utmost punishment an injured
landlord can inflict. :
“I remain, your faithful landlord,
- “E. J. SHIRLey."
There ! The distress has produced nothing like this hitherto. Read
it, starving cottier ; dwell upon it, ruined tenant ; learn the true
division of responsibilities at such a moment, and, above all, rise from
it impressed with the binding—the sacred—the awful duty of paying
your rent . It is the time for inculcating the lesson above all others,
for it is likely to be difficult to afford the means. It is easy to pay
rent when crops are abundant and burdens light—hardly a virtue to be
punctual at such times ; but now, with potatoes blighted, cottiers
starving, rates tripled, it is an effort of virtue to meet the landlord's
demand, and should be specially urged upon the sufferers.
Mark MR. SHIRLEY's division of duties. That of the poor is “to
exert their patience and to calm their fears,” i.e., to be patient under
starvation, and calm their fears as they loathingly swallow their last
fetid “lumper.” That of the rich is to feed the poor, to give them meal,
money, work 7 No: “to devise the best plan to secure food for those
whose means will soon be exhausted.”
The rich must devise the plan ; must they also find the means ?
No, says MR SHIRLEY ; “Government is making grants of money to
enable landlords to employ those in want of work.” The Treasury
advances the money—the rich “devise the plans” for spending it—the
poor are patient and calm .
What is the tenant's duty 2 “To devise plans” also, for his cottiers ?
Not exactly, says MR. Shirley. “The larger tenants must take care of
their cottiers, and supply them with money or meal, in lieu of their potatoes.”
“Paying ” belongs to Government, “feeding ” to the tenant, “devising”
to the landlord. “And thus,” says MR. SHIRLEY, “the burden will be
divided, and all will bear a share of the general calamity l’”
A division, beautiful, equitable, and pleasant for the landlord. Some-
thing like the monkey's, when he swallowed the oyster, and awarded a
shell to plaintiff and defendant.
Pious are the exhortations of MR. SHIRLEY ; noble his summary of
duties at such a moment. “Increase your exertions; secure your
corn ; pay your landlord. Avoid the counsel of those bad men who,
with their rents in their pockets, delay in paying it. Let all such
dread the vengeance of the injured landlord "
And this is MR. Shirley's letter to his starving tenantry!
Pay your rents, and be patient Noble, disinterested, unselfish,
pious, high-minded MR. EvelyN SHIRLEY 1 You shall sit on our right
hand, with the proud title of “Punck's Pet Landlord 1"

PUNCH'S SPANISH BALLADS.—THE REWARDS OF FRANCE.
ARADE thy chain, high-hearted Spain,
that all the world may see,
The Castle and the Lion crouched
beneath the Fleur-de-Lys
BREsson, within the Castle, to each
lacquey dollars throws,
cordon through his nose.
Nor sword nor lance wields sly old
France, gold right and left he
º tosses,
And with a match lets off a batch of
ribbons, stars, and crosses;
For his Majesty has changed the plan
that used to be in vogue;
The rogue once hung o' the cross, but
now the cross hangs on the
rogue.
-
“Come, Conde, try; come, Duque, buy;
here's a title for disgrace,
A star to blaze upon his breast, that
should blush to show his face;
Here's the cross of Honour's Legion
for dishonour's foullest stain,
And the Golden Fleece for him that aids to filch the wealth of Spain.
“Come, Mon, Pidal, my ministers, ye’ve been a servile crew,
Here’s a cross, big knave, and bigger knave, here's a bigger Cross
for you!
But thou, my own Heraldo, there be Duques, Condes, higher,
But take thou the biggest cross of all that art the biggest liar.”
So spake old France, as grinning he distributed his graces,
To the gentlemen with hollow hearts, forked tongues, and brazen
faces.
There were ministers and writers who had vied which could lie louder,
And Field Marshals that gun-cotton never smelt, much less gun-
powder.
But round about the palace, as those honours were bestowing,
In shadowy mail, with woe and wail, were Spain's old heroes going;
Ruy Diaz shook his ghostly fist—the grim old Campeador—
Gonzalez's handgrasped airy brand, DEL CARPIo's spirit swore.
“The ſoulfiendseize, bothnecks and knees, these recreants to Spain!
My old bones ne'er in Burgos will rest at peace again—
Tho' dead and dry, when France crows high and Spain is in the dust,
Confound them if they don't get up and walk offin disgust 1
“I was a gladsome stripling when I slew the Count LozAN ;
When I wedded fair XIMENA I was a merry man;
When on five necks of Moorish kings I set my mailed heel,
I felt what, in such cases, a gentleman must feel.
“But of all the thrashings e'er I gave, and they’ve not been a few,
As you know, FERNAN. Gonzalez, and so, CARPIo, do you ;
Notask would so delight me, killing kings nor wedding wives,
As to thrash these rogues within, at most, an inch of their low lives!”
So spake the CID, Gonzalez chid, BERNARDo shook his lance,
That once, at RoncezvaLLEz, stayed the onward stride of France,
And sadly thought those noble ghosts of the Spanish days of old,
Ere knightly faith was grown a lie, and good steel changed for gold.
HOSTS OF CLAIMANTS.
The RE are as many claimants for the new planet as there are for the gun-cotton. An
astronomer in every capital has sprung up to claim LE WERRIER's new discovery. This
juvenile planet promises in a short time to have as many names as a Portuguese princess,
for every claimant has thought fit to christen it. Its name at present is Arago Aurora
Georgium, Sidus Herschel Le Verrier Victoria Louis-Philippe Frederic Neptune. Really
there should be an astronomical registry for the births of planets; and, to avoid disputes,
the astronomer who was the first to register a new-born star, should be declared its lawful
parent. LE VERRIER has been decorated by Louis-PHILIPPE, who has given him leave to
wear the star in his button-hole.
A VERY REMARKABLE CRIME AND TRIAL.
The Wellington Statue has now been on its trial for the last month. The verdict that
has been passed upon it by all judges of art, has been—“Guilty of Man's-Laughter.”
And CHRistiNA leads the Lion by a
A MATRIMONIAL DILEMMA.
The DUKE DE MonTPENSIER cannot speak a
word of Spanish, and the INFANTA of Spain
cannot speak a word of French, at least so says
a Madrid paper. This double state of ignorance
may lead to a double state of bliss. The DUKE
cannot possibly reproach the INFANTA, and she,
in her turn, if she has any future cause to regret
her present marriage, will not be able to inveigh,
à la CAUDLE, against the DUKE. An interpreter
must continually be present, if they wish to un-
derstand each other. This will be a constant
source of mal-entendus, and rumours will always
be finding their way into the newspapers that
between the DUKE and the DUCHEss.” This
ignorance of the Spanish (which cannot, at all
events, be said of Louis-PHILIPPE, who, cousi-
dering his immense fortune, has certainly the
Spanish at his fingers' ends) in the DUKE, ac-
“The Prince was so overpowered that he could
not find words to express his joy.” What a courtier-
like way of saying the DUKE could not speak the
language 1 But we should recollect that the
Débats is paid handsomely to pay the royal family
compliments. It is the only luxury Louis-Phi-
LIPPE is extravagant in.
MRS. HARRIS GIVETH MRS. GAME?
A LIFT.
THE serious Standard saith—
“It is a good rule in political warfare to assume that the
man for whom most contempt is expressed, is always the
man most dreaded by those who assume the contemptuous.”
Of course this honest—this “good rule"
applies equally well to woman as to man. Hence
doth Mrs. Harris assume that when Punch has
his heartiest laugh at poor Mrs. Gamp, he does
really and truly, in his craven soul, most dread
her Well, we confess it. After all, the woman
of Shoe Lane is assuredly not a person to be
laughed at.

THE DISADVANTAGES OF SCIENCE.
AMoNG other arrangements which prevent the

the invention of the electric telegraph. In
runaway matches by rail many a spark, upon
going to alight, has been dreadfully put out by
the power of electricity. Love, which has con-
quered so many difficulties, has at last been van-
quished by the savans. It is in contemplation
by the fair sex to get a Bill brought into Par-
liament to take elopements specially out of
the jurisdiction of the Electric Telegraph.

A DEEP DESIGN.
As A PLAN is about to be carried out for passing an electric
sº- telegraph under the streets of London. We have heard of
se walls having ears; but this is a scheme for giving tongues
E - - to the streets, which will enable them to rival the cele-
sº brated stones that were nearly rising up to remonstrate
== - against some fearful piece of tyranny. We presume that
s=s an under-tone will be best adapted to this subterranean
==A=S language. The telegraph, when completed, is to be let out
===S - to the public at so much a message.
sº-S º This will do very well, unless the whole population
Rºss s wants to talk at once, when the effect would be rather
às SS extraordinary. We have not heard what arrangements
sºs are to be made to prevent the wrong people from receiving
the messages that are sent by the telegraph. It will be
very awkward if a somewhat general observation should
arrive at a station, for there would be a difficulty in finding
an owner for a remark of such a common-place character.
The plan seems good, but it will require much modifica-
tion to render it effectual. Ladies who avail themselves
of the telegraph will be charged by the length of the
message, and no female will be allowed to monopolise
the use of the subterranean tongue for longer than ten
minutes. This seems to us a most wholesome precaution.
A DISTINCTION WITHOUT A DIFFerence.
A PHILANTHRoPIST has proposed a modified form of
capital punishment. He suggests that all criminals con-
demned to death, should have their sentence commuted
to a journey on the Eastern Counties Railway.
3}ublic ºpinion amb tſje Buke's $tatue.
THERE is considerable difficulty experienced in collecting the opinions
of the public on this monstrous affair. The general expression on the
countenance of every one who looks up at it seems to say, as distinctly
as possible, “I’ve no opinion of it.” We have been at some pains to
get correct reports of the public sentiment, but we have been unable to
catch anything more decisive than “Well, I never !” with an occa-
sional “Did you ever ?” when the critic has been in the company of a
friend. It is one thing to submit a matter to public opinion, but it is
another thing to say in what manner public opinion is to be collected
and interpreted. One of the most frequent ebullitions of sentiment
that the Statue has elicited, consisted of the two monosyllables “Oh 1
My l’ uttered in a state of profound bewilderment.
We, of course, are quite unable to decide whether this “Oh My "
is intended to convey a favourable judgment; and a shriek of “Lawk!”
which we have repeatedly heard from persons looking at the Statue, is
equally difficult of translation. Something, however, may be done by
having a clerk—like the omnibus time-keepers—employed in noting
down the various sensations that the spectators of the Statue in the
course of the day happen to manifest. There ought, however, to be a
description of the person giving the opinion, together with a sketch of
his biography; for as there are some people
“Whose praise is censure, and whose censure praise,”
it is right to know who and what they are before we attempt to esti-
mate the value of their judgment. . No person should be allowed to go
by Hyde Park Corner without a passport, which should be regularly
viséd by a proper officer; and the opinion of the individual to whom
the document belongs should be written at the foot of it.
MONTPENSIER IN SPAIN.
The DUKE DE MontPENSIER has been in a state of the most utter
destitution with reference to tokens of respect from the population of
Madrid. If a stray cheer has been heard anywhere he has poked
forth his head and bowed, in the vain hope of being able to appropriate
to himself something or other, however trifling, in the shape of public
approbation. His neck has been on the stretch from morning until
night, to enable him to scent out a stray viva, but not one has he been
able to appropriate, for not one has been intended for himself. It is to be
regretted that in addition to the ballet arrangements made for the pur-
pose of giving life and spirit to his progress, nothing was done in the
M. #. an engagement of supernumeraries to hail and cheer him in
aciriol.
If the celebrated MR.W. WEST had been secured, we are certain that an
imposing spectacle might have been got up, which would at least have
been sufficiently imposing to impose on those who were not in the
secret of the manner in which the affair had been contrived. When we
recollect that the enthusiastic reception of Masaniello at Drury Lane
Theatre was contrived for several consecutive nights at three pounds
per night, we cannot but feel convinced that the Montre NSIER marriage
would have gone off amid acclamations, with a little proper manage-
ment.

THE drama has, we are happy to say, been flourishing in the pro-
vinces. We attended a country theatre a few nights ago, where we
found a juvenile tragedian, in a stock dress, saying to a young lady in
stiff white muslin, “I once loved yer, but now I hate yer,” and the .
heavy man refusing vigorously to be “hounded and unted by a hup-
start hurchin.” All this was refreshing; but nothing was more delicious
than to find the Lady of the Lake inviting Fitzjames to partake of her
hospitality at a little round table, like a three-legged stool run to seed,
with nothing on it but a black bottle. WALTER Scott's poetry was
magnificent in the mouths of the various members of the dramatic
corps, but our delight knew no bounds when Rhoderick Dhu, rushing in
with two supernumeraries a little after his proper time, exclaimed—
“These are Clan Alpine warriors true;
And, Saxon, I am RhodERick (a little over) Dhu.”
Young Malcolm Graeme we recognised as an old gentleman who had
been officiating as box-keeper during the first piece, and we purchased
a play-bill of the Macduff, who had come round to the front at the
conclusion of Macbeth. Macduff also superintended the soda-water
stall and refreshment cupboard during the intervals of his professional
occupation. After killing Macbeth, he hurried round to preside at
the stall, while the local PomoNA went round among the audience
with “apples, oranges, nuts and pears, ginger-beer and bottled
porter 1" We fancied we recognised Fleance putting out the lamps
at the end of the performance. We are quite sure that Duncan called
up our fly to the door when we quitted the theatre.

AMong the new schemes of the day perhaps the most notable or not—
able is a project for pulling the public along a railway by means of
Indian Rubber. This is all very well in its way ; but when we ask how
the Indian Rubber is to act, the well known exclamation, “Aye |
there's the rub l’ intrusively suggests itself. We understand that
there is to be an elastic band attached to the horse or carriage that is
ºl
ºil
to be drawn along, and the elastic band, will of course “pull out;” a
process that is likewise expected from the shareholders. The force
with which the elongated caoutchouc will contract, must necessarily
drag anything attached to it towards a given point with considerable
velocity. The travellers will thus be nicely drawn in, and so will the
public, if any money is deposited on the faith of the project.

MODEL HOUSES.
- It has been the fashion lately to export to the colonies Model
Houses. They take to pieces and are put together again like a Chinese
puzzle. They have, likewise, the advantage of being packed in a very
small compass. A gentleman who went over to Sydney this year
assured us he had his drawing-room in his trunk, the parlour in his
portmanteau, the attic in his carpet-bag, the kitchen in his hat-box,
and the scullery in his coat pocket. A Gray's Inn Lane contractor
has favoured us with the following list of houses he has recently built
for Australia:—
A MoDEL Lopcing House.—This has been arranged upon the plan
of the lodging-houses in London. The house is made to contain as
many rooms as possible. Cupboards are fitted up as bedrooms, and
beds are ingeniously concealed in piano-fortes, sideboards, and chests-
of-drawers. Two keys have been sent to every lock—one for the use
of the lodger and the other for the landlady. The pantry is small, as
it has been found that nothing ever keeps in a lodging-house pantry
longer than a day. A large pump is also fitted up in the cellar. The
most singular thing is, that for the number of rooms in this model
house there is only one bell, which communicates with the drawing:
tifully carpetted, with velvet cushions; whilst the free sittings are
comparatively few and niggardly. Outside the private pews is written
“One Shilling,” as a guide what to charge for the price of a seat.
A Model House of CoMMONs.—This house is built exclusively of
wood. As it is intended to contain the heads of the nation, it is
divided into two sides—the side that is “in,” and the “out” side.
In the corner there is an immense dust-bin for the reception of the
petitions. The house is beautifully ventilated, and there are pipes, as
in a bath, marked “hot” and “cold,” which any member can turn
when he wishes, for a fresh supply of air. Several models of the
Speaking Automaton have been sent out with this model House of
Commons.
A Model THEATRE.-This theatre is like most London theatres,
half of the seats being so arranged that the spectator cannot see, and
the other half that he cannot hear.
room ; the other rooms have bells, only all the wires are broken. a
Accommodation is provided for not more than one servant, whose bed
in the kitchen has been cleverly contrived to pull in and out, exactly
like the large drawer of a kitchen dresser. One mustard-pot, one
coal-scuttle, one dish-cover, one teapot, one pair of sugar-tongs have
been sent out as the furniture of this model house. Every domestic
article, in fact, is limited to one—the unities have been beautifully pre-
served. A long list of “extras,” as charged in London, has been sent
out with the house. It includes boot-cleaning, attendance, towels, and
the use of a Britannia fork and spoon. A big cat accompanies this
model house; it has a very broad back, so as to be able to bear all the
broken things that, in a lodging house, are always put upon it. '
A Model. Church—The peculiarity about this model of a London
Church is, that the whole body of it is taken up with privatepews, beau-
A French Dictionary and a complete set of “La France Dramatique”
have been sent out with the model. A statue of SHAksPEARE is to be
put over the portico, “just for the look of the thing.”
POSTHUMOUS RENOWN.
THE DUKE of LEEDs has closed Glen Lin Beg, the DUKE of ATHoH,
Glen Tilt, against the tourist. Long live both their Graces ! but
should anything happen to either of them, how appropriate to him will
be the simple epitaph, “Stop, Traveller 1"

TALES FOR THE MARINES.
TALE THE SEVENTH.
HEN A narrative is most agreeable
to the military and naval profes-
sions there are ladies in the case ;
for a remarkable sympathy exists
between the brave and the fair.
Some of the gentler sex prefer the
red coat, others have a partiality
for the tarry trowsers. Partaking
of the nature both of the soldier
and the sailor, you, Marines, pos-
sess, for the feminine heart, the
attractions of either uniform.
Donbly dear, then, to the daughters
of England, you must be twice as
much interested in all that relates
to them as either of the other
classes of heroes ; and to hear of
anything that redounds to their
credit will be particularly gratify-
ing to your gallant hearts. You
will, therefore, be highly delighted
by the following piece of intelli-
gence :—
The ladies, especially in London,
are in a state of extreme agitation
no uncommon circumstance in
individual cases, you will say :
but somewhat rare among them
collectively. You will fear that
- 5 something must have happened to
º alarm and distress them ; and such
- is the case. They have been sadly
alarmed by some information
which has reached them of the mortality, sickness, and miseries produced amongst the
assistants, male and female, of linen-drapers, milliners, sempstresses, and others, through late
hours of business. They are also greatly distressed by the reflection, that from having, for
convenience sake, been used to make late purchases, or at least from not having spoken out
against this bad system, these evils are partly chargeable on themselves. Hence their above-
mentioned agitation, which is not an all-overishness and a fluttering in the chest, but an agi-
tation in behalf of the early-closing movement.
This is now the paramount subject at all tea-tables. It takes precedence even of the
fashions, and the last waltz. “Oh how dreadful l’” are the first words you hear on entering a
drawing-room. You inquire “What?”—“To be cooped up for fifteen or sixteen hours,”
is the reply, “in hot close rooms, all full of the smell of gas, and that horrid—what is it 2
–carbonic acid. To be obliged to stand, too, all that time. To have no opportunity to
improve the mind of an evening, by study. To have no time for exercise. To have the com-
plexion spoiled, and the figure ruined. To have the seeds of consumption, and all sorts of
illnesses sown in one–oh! one shudders at the idea. To think what those poor young people
suffer all the while they seem so agreeable and pleasant, and so happy in serving us !
One's prettiest dress looks quite a fright ; one's smartest ribbons seem odious when one
remembers where one bought them. And, oh gracious ! suppose any of these wretched
complaints should be infectious !” So talk the ladies; but they not only talk; they act.
They are to be seen running about at all hours—(till the evening)—from shop to shop.
This is not, however, to purchase anything they want, or do not want, but to assure
MR. BoBBINs, and MR. TAPE, and MR. Twist, that they will never buy anything more at their
establishments unlessfhey close them at seven o'clock. Owing to these tradesmen keeping to
late hours, and the ladies to their word, scarcely any female dress that you meet with appears
new. Last months' fashions are universally retained, and the trimmings of nearly every
bonnet are unseasonable. The ladies go without all sorts of things they are dying for. To
these privations they cheerfully submit, in their determination to effect their humane object.
You have heard, gallant fellows, many an instance of woman's self-denial ; but you never
before heard of anything like this ; which, to the honour of the sex, is recorded in the seventh
story that Punch has recounted—to the Marines.
PUNCH'S POLITICAL DICTIONARY.
NATIONAL DEBT. A debt owing by the whole nation : and its enormous amount is said
to be a proof of our wealth ; so that if this principle holds good, an individual who wishes
to get rich, has only to run over head and ears in debt, as rapidly as possible. It is consoling
to know that this great source of our prosperity is not likely to be paid off before the
year 2053, at the present rate of diminution, so that our heirs will have all the benefit that is
to be derived from the tremendous liability.
NATURALization. Converting an alien into a natural. Aliens, who come to reside in the
United Kingdom for the purpose of settling, may be made Naturals, but it oftener happens
that Naturals, with bills which they have no intention of settling, become Aliens by aban-
| doning the country of their creditors.
NAVY, BRITISH. The article with which BRI-
TANNLA rules the waves, and enables Britons to
declare they “never, never, never, never will
be slaves.” ALFRED THE GREAT started the
English navy on a very small scale; but it has
been augmented almost ever since by various
sovereigns. The first naval architect of any
note was one PHINEAs PETT, who lived in the
reign of JAMEs I., and the king had the good
sense to make a Pett of him. The improvement
of the navy was called his Majesty's Pett pro-
ject, in compliment to the naval architect. The
British Navy, like the British Drama, has been
greatly increased, if not improved, by transla-
tions from the French, which used at one time
to be very general.
31°gal £ntelligence.
THE usual preparations have been made for
the commencement of Michaelmas Term, and
MR. BRIEFLEss has given a series of private
rehearsals at home, with the view of rubbing off
the rust of the long vacation. He has addressed
a plaster-of-Paris bust of SIGNOR MILTONE–as
the Italian vendor called him—and entreated
with the most passionate earnestness that his
Lordship—for as such MR. BRIEFLEss apostro-
phised the bust—would permit him to have
judgment as in case of a nonsuit.
The gown of MR. BRIEFLEss came home from
the scourer's last week; and his wig, which had
become black at the tips by absorbing the ink
in the desk behind the place he generally occu-
pies in Court, has been refreshed by half an
ounce of additional grey horsehair. His clerk,
Thomson, is occupied every day in filling up a
blank book with nominal engagements, through
which he is supposed to glance when making
any appointment, in order that an open day may
be granted to a bonā fide client.
A dummy list of Causes has long since been
preferred, to enable Thomson to ascertain whether
“we are retained on the other side,” when a
brief is brought on behalf of either party. The
bill-sticker has been called in to paper the walls
of the chambers with sittings-papers, sessions-
papers, and other legal documents that are in-
tended to stand until the next year's long vaca
tion.
Preparations for the Winter.
THE Nelson Column has been laid up for the
winter. Fresh straw has been wrapped round
its solitary foot, and the door of the palings has
been locked, to prevent a draught coming in.
The key has been left with the housekeeper of
the National Gallery, who will be very happy,
on the payment of a fee, to show the interior of
the hoarding to strangers. The collection of
rubbish inside is very rich. There is a large
stone covered with ivy, and a nettle, a real
Leicestersquariensis, four feet high. There are
likewise two mortars. These are preserved in
hods, and one is exceedingly interesting, from
its date being marked on it in large figures,
“1838.”
'The Gun-Cotton Mania.
HUNDREDs of people have commenced claiming
the Gun-Cotton as their own invention. Amongst
others, there is a friend of ours who says he
never wore a nightcap, because he knew the
inflammable nature of cotton would have cer-
tainly rendered him light-headed.
NATURAL ENOUGH
Mrs. Gamp objects very strongly to the Opening
of the Ports, but declares herself quite ready to
assent to a proposition for opening the gins,
rums, and brandies.

UNDouBTEDLY the best thing to be done with the arch at Hyde Park
Corner is to turn it into an Advertising Station, which will have the
double advantage of covering up an eye-sore and turning it into a
source of profit. What has failed to prove ornamental, should at
least be rendered useful, if any plan can be devised for effecting such a
purpose. The DUKE is, we suppose, to remain where he is, for he has
nearly completed his third week, and we have seen as yet no placard
announcing “positively the last appearance but three" of the DUKE
of WELLINGTON. We have not heard of his engagement having been
renewed for a limited period, and we presume therefore that he is to
continue permanently in his present capacity. This makes it still more
desirable that our plan for turning the arch into an Advertising Station
should be acted upon. The scheme should be adopted every alternate
week, so that the portion of the public which is disgusted by the appear-
ance of the Statue should have some relief during the time when the
arch should be used as a station for advertisements.
LONDON IN A.D. 2346.
“But the great feature of this meeting of the Archaeological Institute, was the Secre-
tary's report on the interesting discoveries made on the site of Old London, with the dis-
cussion it gave rise to.”—Times, of April 1st., A.D. 2346.
THE Secretary begs to lay before the members of the New London
Archaeological Institute the following report of the very curious disco-
veries made in the course of the excavations now going on for the
foundations of the Universal Railway Terminus, to which the officers
of the Society have had access by the gracious permission of His
Majesty, HUDson XIV.
The site of Old London had long been known to the Society, but
the immense expense of laying bare its remains, owing to the great mass
of scoriae and the solid coating of lava, which overwhelmed that great and
once famous city, in the fearful eruption of Mount Vesuvius, which
rises in the district still known as the Surrey Zoological Gardens, they
had hitherto despaired of making those discoveries, which the liberality
of His Majesty has enabled them to effect.
In the total absence of all documentary evidence, the officers cf the
Society have been compelled to assign conjectural characters and desti-
nations to the several buildings and works discovered. Our imperfect
knowledge of the habits of a bygone and barbarous race may impair
the value of these theories ; but they seem to the authors of the report to
be the only interpretations at all consistent with probability. The part of
the old city first laid bare, was peculiarly rich in objects calculated to
excite interest and stimulate, while they baffle, curiosity. It was a
large area, in form an irregular square, into which debouched three
streets, which, for the period they belong to, may be called wide.
From the unique copy of that inestimable work, Mogg's Guide to
London, in the Society's library, we believe we may confidently state,
that this area is what was known as Trafalgar Square.
The north side of this irregular area, we found occupied by a low
and singularly unsightly range of building, apparently uniting the
purposes of a stone-mason's or sculptor's shed, and a store-room for
pictures. The former conclusion is drawn from the numerous casts
and copies of statues found in the lower part of the building. From
the dark, damp, and unventilated state of the rooms, they obviously
could not have been intended for exhibition or study. They were
probably ware-rooms for depositing unsold or condemned works. The
mean appearance of the exterior of the building forbids the notion that
this can be the “National Gallery,” often spoken of as standing in
Trafalgar Square, in the precious single volume of the “Annual
Register for 1842,” now in the possession of the Society. It is
true that, the building is there unfavourably criticised. But this
building is below all criticism. The pictures, many of them of great
value, were found crowded together in low close rooms. This fact
strikingly illustrates the ignorance of art, which we know, from other
sources, prevailed in this island five hundred years ago. Here are
artistic treasures, (now deposited with solemnity and reverence in our
Grand World Museum,) evidently treated as things of no value what-
ever, stowed away like rubbish. It is clear that no one could have
seen the merits of the pictures in these apartments; so that this may
be confidently pronounced to have been a lumber-room, in which the
pictures were considered as the lumber. The opinion of one of the
Society, that this must have been the “National Picture Gallery”
alluded to by the old chronicler, GRANT, in his imbecile but curious
volume, “The Great Metropolis,” we have not thought worth com-
bating.
In front of this enigmatic erection we found two shallow basins, with
very curious instruments in the centre, resembling dumb-waiters, or
such stands as those on which articles of refreshment are displayed in
confectioners' shops, but even smaller. They are of red granite, with
four dolphins' heads below. This would point to some connection
with water.
Was it a recipient for soup, such as we learn from the volume of the
Annual Register above referred to was distributed to the poor in times
of scarcity ? But, if this be a correct explanation, what was
the object of the centre-pieces 2 They may have supported vessels
containing condiments, such as salt, pepper, &c., for the use of
the poor, while taking their soup, or even bread for the same benevo-
lent purpose. But the whole of what we may call the soup-basin
theory, is upset by the curious fact, preserved to us in an old Act of
Parliament of the date A. D. 1834, that out-door relief of the poor
was abolished al-
together in that
year, and that they
were from that
time, if destitute,
- fed only on condi-
tion of submitting
- to imprisonment.
--- The theory that
- . these were foun-
tains with their
º | º ſº reservoirs is abso-
- #| ||
lutely untenable.
The utter want of
proportion between
the basins and the
centre-pieces, and
the miserable di-
mensions of the lat-
ter, point rather to
some purposes of a
domestic or culi-
nary character, in
|
which ornament
has been sacrificed

Hint to Railway Sponsors.
WE are much dissatisfied with the inappropriatenomenclature applied
to railway steam-engines. Bomb-ketches and sloops of war are very
properly termed Erebus, Phlege hon, Hecla, Fury, and so forth : names
expressive of their qualities. Why not style locomotives on a similar
principle 2 As, Helter-skelter, Casualty, Collision, and Breakneck.
Give fitting titles to machines of havoc and destruction.

THE SNOBS OF ENGLAND.
BY ONE OF THEMSELVES.
CHAPTER XXXVI.-A VISIT TO SOME COUNTRY SNOBS.
otABLE as my reception had been (under
that unfortunate mistake of MRs. Ponto
that I was related to LoRD SNoBBING-
ToN, which I was not permitted to cor-
rect), it was nothing compared to the
bowing and kotooing, the raptures, and
flurry which preceded and welcomed
the visit of a real live lord and lord's
son, a brother officer of CoRNET WEL-
LESLEY Ponto, in the 120th Hussars,
who came over with the young Cornet
from Guttlebury, where their distin-
guished regiment was quartered—this
was my LoRD GULEs, LoRD SALTIRE's
grandson and heir . a very young
short sandy-haired and tobacco-smok-
ing nobleman, who cannot have left
the nursery very long, and who, though
he accepted the honest major's invita-
tion to the Evergreens in a letter written
in a school-boy hand-writing, with a
number of faults of spelling, may yet be
a very fine classical scholar for what I
know ; having had his education at
Eton, where he and young Ponto were inseparable.
At any rate, if he can't write, he has mastered a number of other
accomplishments wonderful for one of his age and size. He is one of
the best shots and riders in England. He rode his horse Abracadabra,
and won the famous Guttlebury steeple-chase. He has horses entered
at half the races in the country (under other people's names ; for the
old lord is a strict hand, and will not hear of betting or gambling).
He has lost and won such sums of money as my Lord GeoRGE himself
might be proud of. He knows all the stables, and all the jockeys, and
has all the “information,’ and is a match for the best Leg at Newmarket.
Nobody was ever known to be “too much.” for him : at play or in
the stable.
Although his grandfather makes him a moderate allowance, by the
aid of post-obits and convenient friends he can live in a splendour
becoming his rank. He has not distinguished himself in the knocking
down of policemen much ; he is not big enough for that. But, as a
light-weight, his skill is of the very highest order. At billiards he is
said to be first-rate. He drinks and smokes as much as any two of
the biggest officers in his regiment. With such high talents, who can
say how far he may not go 2 He may take to politics as a délassement,
and be Prime Minister after LoRD GEoRGE BENTINck.
My young friend WELLEsley Ponto is a gaunt and bony youth,
with a pale face profusely blotched. From his continually pulling
something on his chin, I am led to fancy that he believes he has what
is called an Imperial growing there. That is not the only tuft that is
hunted in the family, by the way. He can't, of course, indulge in those
expensive amusements which render his aristocratic comradesorespected:
he bets pretty freely when he is in cash, and rides when somebody mounts
him (for he can't afford more than his regulation chargers). At
drinking he is by no means inferior; and why do you think he brought
his noble friend, Lord GULEs, to the Evergreens 2—Why? because he
intended to ask his mother to order his father to pay his debts, which
she couldn't refuse before such an exalted presence. Young Ponto
gave me all this information with the most engaging frankness. We
are old friends. I used to tip him when he was at school.
“Gad l’” says he, “our wedgment 's so doothid exthpenthif Must
hunt, you know. A man couldn't live in the wedgment if he didn't.
Mess expenses enawmuth. Must dine at mess. Must drink cham-
pagne and claret. Our's aint a port and sherry light-infantry mess.
Uniform's awful. Fitzstultz, our Colonel, will have 'em so.
be a distinction, you know. At his own expense FITzstultz altered
the plumes in the men's caps (you called them shaving-brushes,
SNoB, my boy : most absurd and unjust that attack of yours, by the
way); that altewation alone cotht him five hundred pound. The year
befaw latht he horthed the wegiment at an immenthe expenthe, and
we're called the Queen'th Own Pyebalds from that day. Ever theen
uth on pawade 2 The EMPEwAR Nicholath burtht into tearth of a monster
Must
envy when he thaw uth at Windthor. And you see,” continued my
my young friend, “I brought GULEs down with me, as the Governor is
very sulky about shelling out, just to talk my mother over, who can
do anything with him. GULEs told her that I was Fitzstultz's
favourite of the whole regiment; and, Gad 1 she thinks the Horse
Guards will give me my troop for nothing ! and he humbugged the
Governor that I was the greatest screw in the army. Aint it a good |
dodge 2 ” -
With this WELLesley left me to go and smoke a cigar in the
stables with Lord GULEs, and make merry over the cattle there, |
under STRIPEs's superintendence. Young Ponto laughed with his
friend, at the venerable four-wheeled cruelty-chaise ; but seemed
amazed that the latter should ridicule still more an ancient chariot of
the build of 1824, emblazoned immensely with the arms of the Pontos
and the CRAwleys, from which latter distinguished family MRs.
Ponto issued.
I found poor Pon. in his study among his boots, in such a rueful
attitude of despondency, that I could not but remark. “Look at
that l” says the poor fellow, handing me over a document. “It’s the
second change in uniform since he's been in the army, and yet there's
no extravagance about the lad. LoRD GULEs tells me he is the most
careful youngster in the regiment, God bless him But look at that I
by Heaven, SNoB, look at that, and say how CAN a man of nine hun-
dred keep out of the Bench 7" He gave a sob as he handed me the
paper across the table ; and his old face, and his old corduroys, and
his shrunk shooting-jacket, and his lean shanks, looked, as he spoke,
more miserably haggard, bankrupt, and threadbare.

That evening Mas. Ponto and her family made their darling Wel.

WHO FOUND THE PLANET 2
THE scientific world is standing on tiptoe with excitement to watch
the issue of a dispute between some French and English astronomers, as
to who found the new Planet. M. LE VERRIER was certainly the first that
publicly shouted out Eureka, and to him the merit of discovering the new
luminary had been quietly assigned, until Mr. ADAMs rushes forward,
exclaiming “Oh, what a shame Stop him 11 He's got my Planet!!!”
It is a great pity that when a thing of the kind turns up, the original
finder is not able to mark it with his initials, or to take some course to
prove his right to the article. -
We are not disposed to sanction the claim of MR. ADAMs, for he
asserts that he discovered the Planet a long time ago, but “partly
from the press of other occupations,” he neglected the new-found
treasure. This is all nonsense. Planets are not things to be put by
and overlooked, or taken up after the press of other occupations has
diminished. The celestial luminaries ought not to be treated in this
manner—to be thrust away in a corner, and only noticed again when
found in the hands of some rival astronomer. MR. ADAMs says he
secured the observations of the planet, before M. LE VERRIER could
have seen it at all. No 1 No I this will not do : for it was not treating
the luminary with proper respect, to neglect it after taking a couple of
sights at it.
Tºucal Apathy.
ENGLAND is ruined—gone. Her epitaph has been written by PEEL,
the minister, who has slain her. It is not BRITANNIA, but only her
ghost, that rules the waves. Nevertheless, the DURE of NEwcasTLE,
whom we thought in a hermitage, with a flowing beard and long
nails, in mourning for the destruction of his unhappy country—did ab-
solutely dine, a few days ago, with the farmers of Éast Retford . We
thought him clothed in sackcloth, and his head powdered with ashes ;
and we are astounded, nay afflicted, by his Grace's levity, to find him
taking champagne with the remains of English farmers
TO FOOTMEN, HOUSE-MAIDS, AND OTHERS.
THE Morning Post having wished to meet the public demand
—a demand that it fondly hopes to increase by feeding it–
for private and confidential letters of statesmen (Whigs in par-
ticular), herewith assures all footmen, house-maids, tygers,
errand-boys, and others, that it will give the very highest
price for any communications, dropt from their masters'
pockets, or carelessly and negligently left in desks or drawers
(locked or unlocked). Such letters will be paid for by the line ;
the sum varying with the implicit secrecy of the contents. In
all instances, however, the parties will be most liberally dealt
with.
It must be obvious to the reflecting domestic, that by thus
contributing to the Morning Post, and to the amusement and
instruction of a discerning public, he will safely obtain a hand-
some remuneration, without rendering himself liable to any Old
Bailey inconvenience that might result from the peculation of
even tea and sugar.

papers.
MORE WORK FOR SIR PETER LAURIE.
WE perceive by an advertisement in the Times, that a discri-
minating Fancy Cabinet-maker in the City sells his goods,
not according to the tastes, but according to the size and per-
sonal accomplishments, of his customers. Thus we find that
“a very complete Lady's” rosewood writing-desk is to be had for
30s. ; “a small size Lady’s” ditto for 25s.; and “a handsome full
size Lady’s” ditto is not to be got under 4!. Now against this
atrocious system we feel called upon, in the name of the
British Female Public, most indignantly to protest. Why are
“very complete” ladies to pay more for their goods than
“small size” ladies, we should like to know? And why are
“handsome full size” ladies to be charged nearly four times as
much as little ones 7 We had better have a Beauty and
Stature Tax at once. The practice must be at once “put
down.” We recommend the matter to our friend, SIR PETER.

WE understand that it is in contemplation by the Directors of the
Eastern Counties Railway to add a shaving saloon as well as a smoking
saloon to some of the trains for first-class passengers. The length of
time occupied on the journey is sometimes so considerable that a per-
son quitting the carriage on arriving at his destination feels ashamed
to go forth, in consequence of his beard having grown to a most
unsightly length since he left the terminus he started from.
The annexed portraits of a gentleman, before and after coming out
of the railway carriage between London and Norwich, will convey some
idea of the necessity there must be for a shaving saloon on the Eastern
Counties.
Considering that the Directors are wonderfully close shavers them-

the part of their customers.

TALES FOR THE MARINES.
TALE THE EIGHTH.
AMONGST you, brave fellows, there are
probably some Highlanders; and for
the sake of your comrades you will
be interested in any news from the
Highlands. You are of course aware
that the most remarkable character-
istic of the Gaëlic race is their
feeling of clanship, and of attachment
to their chiefs, at whose bidding they
will willingly go through fire and
water, and are ready for anything
from sheep-stealing to high-treason.
It is well known to you how many of
them, from acting under this sentiment,
have, in former times, come to the
gallows.
Enthusiasm, however, may be direct-
ed to a good end as well as a bad one;
and that by which the Scottish moun-
taineers are inspired, has, in fact, been
turned to the best account. By that
personal devotion to the head of their
clan, through which their chieftain
used to instigate them to ravage their
neighbours' lands, he now induces them
to improve their own. Do not believe
that the Highlands are converted into
sheep-walks, and their inhabitants ex-
patriated; in short, that there are any
clearings in those districts but clearings
of moss and heath. Tell that to the
Sailors. No ; the truth is, that the
Highland lairds, almost without excep-
tion, are applying themselves with all
their energies, not to making, but to
cultivating wastes.
It is a common sight in the High-
lands to see a body of fellows, who a
century back would have been caterans, defiling through a mountain,
or marching up a glen in their national costume, to the dulcet
measures of the bag-pipe. You would think they were proceeding to
levy black-mail, lift cattle, or commit arson. No such thing. The
enterprise on which they are bound, is the draining, or otherwise
reclaiming of some moor or barren tract of country. National songs
composed by national poets, serve to inflame their industrial, as similar
ditties did, formerly, their predatory ardour. The tunes to which
these lays are adapted, consist of those old familiar strains which
always touch a responsive chord in the Scottish heart; but the words
being modern, there is now arising an entirely new description of
Highland minstrelsy.
The following is a sketch of one of these songs :-
Air-Pibroch o' Donald Dhu.
“Pibroch o' DoNALD Dhu,
Pibroch o' Donald,
Yonder hill-side to pleugh,
Summon CLANRONALD.
Call the MAC GREGoR's men;
Bid them not tarry :
LocBIEL bring up the glen
Along wi' GLENGARRY.”
Such exhortations as “Drain the land, laddie,” and “Awa’ weeds,
awa'!” and such expressions of feeling as “Hey the bonny gypsum !”
form the burden of these national airs. What with their pipes and
rural strains, and the occupations of their happy inhabitants, the
Highlands have now become a perfect Arcadia. For this, all thanks
and honour are due to the patriotic and patriarchal chiefs who so
creditably labour in their different spheres of usefulness, as is avouched
in this, the Eighth story, wherewith Punch has edified—the Marines.
ILLUSTRIOUS DESCENT.
AMong the manuscripts shown at Hatfield House was an illuminated
pedigree of QUEEN ELIzABETH tracing her descent directly up to ADAM.
We know a baby in humble life who can boast of an equally respectable
pedigree, for its descent can be traced to New Year's Eve.
A ROYAL EDITOR.
THE KING of BAvARIA is about to start a newspaper, which, rumour
says, he is to edit himself. We can imagine the king sitting on the
throne, with an immense pair of scissors in one hand, and the paste
brush in the other, writing his Zeitung, whilst the printer's devil is
knocking at the door of the palace calling for “copy.” His Royal
Majesty scarcely knows the pains and penalties of an editor yet, or else
he would not be so ambitious of rushing into newspaper authorship.
How will he like opening three hundred letters a day,+every one of
them finding fault with some part of his paper ?
How will he like being knocked up at three o'clock in the morning
to come down to the office, and open an express?
How will he like collecting his quarterly subscriptions, or answering
his correspondents' inquiries—Whether his Majesty will be graciously
pleased to take out their subscriptions in coals, candles, German sau-
sages, sauer kraut, seltzer water, or Bavarian beer?
How will he like some enraged author or angry actor of his Royal
Theatre, or pugilistic member, a German GRANTLEY BERKELEY, enter-
ing his office, and, not knowing he is the king, laying the horsewhip
across his royal shoulders for some smart personality or witty
criticism 2
How will he like being prosecuted for a libel ? or is he prepared to
put in the old plea “the King can do no wrong?” because the same yarn,
of course, would apply to grammatical errors, false syllogisms, erro-
neous quotations, and all sorts of nonsense, though it is very doubtful
whether his readers would take the excuse, and might not write to His
Majesty to stop sending in the paper.
Has His Majesty fully weighed all these possibilities 2 Has he also
thought about the “Court Circular 7” He can hardly write that
himself, though to be sure no one could know so well as himself what
the king has been doing during the day; still we cannot imagine,
without laughing, His Majesty sitting down to write such information
as the following :-
“Yesterday His Majesty went to the Printing-Office and wrote a
couple of the most stunning leaders.”
“In the afternoon His Majesty took a walk in the English Garden,
and read two dozen manuscripts.”
“His Majesty dined in the Maximilian Saal. The Foreign Editor,
and the London and Indian Correspondents had the honour of dining
with His Majesty.”
“His Majesty took tea in the Salvator Strasse, and transacted busi-
mess with his Sub.”
“In the evening, His Majesty went again to the Printing-Office, and
dashed off a “Shower of Frogs’ whilst waiting for his “slips.’ His
Majesty, also, in the meantime, wrote an “Ode to Ludwig the Great,
as well as a criticism upon it. As the Augsbourg Lohnkutsche express
had not yet come in, His Majesty went to the Royal Theatre, to wit-
ness the first performance of the grand opera in six acts of ‘Der Katzen-
jammer; the libretto by the KING of BAvARIA. After the perform-
ance, His Majesty walked to the Newspaper Office, to write his notice,
and waited there till a late hour correcting his proofs. His Majesty
sent over to the Baierischer Spitzbübe for a glass of warm kirschen-
wasser.”
The KING of BAvARIA's paper, however, will have one great peculi-
arity. It will be the only paper published in Germany not subject to
the censorship.
We quite long to see the first number.
We hope His Majesty will
put us on the Free List.
We shall be happy to “exchange” with him.
Magisterial Logic.
MAGISTRATE to Gentleman.—Your offence, sir, is most atrocious, and
cannot be in any way justified. You have nearly killed one man, and
seriously injured another. Your conduct was most brutal, and
deserves to be reprobated with the strongest punishment. I shall,
therefore, inflict upon you the penalty of five shillings, &c.—Wide the
Papers every day.
A GOOD REASON.
MR. GRANTLEY BERRELEY puts great faith in a “punch on the head,”
for judging by himself he believes the head to be the softest and most
assailable part of the human anatomy.
A New Stock.
A CoRRespondent writes to inquire why the “City Intelligence” of
the daily papers does not include Laughing Stocks in the account of
the Stock Market 2 We certainly think this would be a new and im-
portant feature on ‘Change; for Laughing-Stocks—among whom may
be classed PALMERston, NorMANBY, and Bulwer—have lately been
done at a very high rate, and may be quoted at a very pretty figure.

OH ! is it for a Christening that Spain's Grandees are met 2
For a baby, in its long clothes, in the midst of them is set :
And if babies know what pride is, proud that babe should be, Iween,
Crowed to by an Infanta, and dandled by a Queen.
No, it is not for a Christening, that Spain's Grandees are come,
And 'tis no common baby there, that sucks its little thumb,
And rolls its stone-blue saucer eyes, and kicks and chirps with glee—
'Tis MASTER BREsson, ten months old, whom the Queen creates Grandeel.
Not, as of yore, for Paynim slain, or town won from the
Turk:
The honour's given, but to his sire, for dark and dirty work.
And who shall dare a voice to raise, when Her Majesty
decrees,
That an Infanta's marriage shall make Infantine Grandees?
So there they stand, a noble band 1 blue bloodin every vein;
The Lermas and Ossunas and Medinas of Old Spain;
Whose fathers ruled her councils, whose blood for her was
shed
wherº Lion and the Castle waved o'er dying and o'er
ead l
Yes, these their race—of vacant face, and low retreating
brow
All over-dressed and under-sized; such are Spain's noblest
now.
And, worthy deed for such a seed, these full-grown babies,
see,
Receive a baby to their ranks—a ten-months' old Grandee :
Nurse, set down “FRANCOIs PAUL PHILIPPE DE BREsson”
safe and well ;
Nurse, lift him up, “EL DUQUE DE SANTA Is ABEL ' "
Henceforth, when at the court his sucking Excellence is seen,
His little hat and feathers he may wear before the Queen 1
But for deeds like BREsson, senior's, such guerdon is too
light ; -
When we're about it, let us dub his little Highness, Knight;
Santiago, Calatrava–let him have which he prefers,
The prettiest, plumpest, little squire, that ever won his
spurs. - -
The QUEEN girds on the golden spurs upon his little socks;
MUNoz around his tiny waist the belt of honour locks ;
While, fingering his Toledo like one very ill at ease,
The Accolade of valour gives FIELD-MARECHAL D'Assiz.
But thro' the affair, high up in air, was a clash and sound
of war,
clothed in steel from head to heel, looked down the

trample !

The John Bull, FIGHT OF Louis PHILIPPE.
THE sun shines on the Plaza, but brighter than his beaming,
The lustrous eyes of ladies from mantilla-folds are gleaming;
Fair cheeks are flushed, soft hearts are hard, calm pulses
thick and full,
For the signal that says “Exit Alcalde, enter Bull.”
But why this lordly gathering of princes and of peers?
Why so courteous bow ambassadors who’ve long been by
the ears ?
Why doth Austria despotic greet Prussia doctrinaire,
And France exchange a friendly hug with the rugged
Russian Bear 2
Is it Montes they flockforth to see, that famous matador?
Or is Romero's ghost come back to face the bull once more?
Or hath Pepe Illo risen to prove, that, spite of Gallic gold,
Still hand of Spaniard may be true, and heart of Spaniard
bold 2
No, 'tis a craftier swordsman must try his courage here,
And on a lustier brute, than all La Mancha's pastures rear-
Full well, Iween, may looks be keen, and every seat be full,
For Louis-PHILIPPE is matador, and England sends the
Bull I
The bell is rung, the key is flung, the grate is opened wide,
And from the torillesiurely comes John Bull in his pride;
His hide is dark, his sinews stark, his fore-hoof ploughs the
dust, -
As who'd say, “I don't like fighting; but if I must, I must.

Then first aspire to raise his ire the picadors of print,
They ply their puny lances, but the Bull won't take the hint ;
His red eye burns, as round he turns, all armed against surprise,
While PALMERSTon, the chulo, shakes his broadsheet in his eyes.
In vain they ply, with shout and cry—their tickling darts he scorns;
They can't provoke a single stroke of those portentous horns;
He shakes his rocky forehead, not an inch of ground he'll yield–
But ere he'll fight, a worthier foe than these must take the field.
The crackers flash, and fiz and crash, the Bull is calm and still,
The crowd cry shame, but all the same he holds his sturdy will ;
For against his fighting stomach a proper feeling pulls—
He has a Mrs. Bull at home, and several little Bulls.
Till, wearied out with waiting, for the matador they cry,
And lo, Louis-PHILIPPE appears, the smooth-faced and the slyl
All soft and smug comes the old humbug, with entente-cordiale to blind
him,
A pleasant smile upon his face, and a sharp sword held behind him.
The crowd are dumb, the time is come, the Bull is firm and steady,
While, soft and slow, draws nigh the foe—both smile and sword are
ready—

THE FIRST FOG.
THE fog made its first appearance this season on the evening of
Wednesday, the 28th of October. Its débùt was, on the whole, success-
ful. It has undergone very little change since last year, for it is as
remarkable as ever for the qualities by which it has ever been dis-
tinguished. It has lost nothing of that rich depth which has given it
talked about, and was in everybody's mouth within a very short time
of its arrival. We have not heard of any evening having been fixed for
its next visit.
Short Time.
THE Strand Theatre has been compelled again to work short time.
It closed, after an unusual season of a fortnight, on Saturday. The
charwoman and two checktakers—that is to say, the whole company—
are still open to engagements. They have a notion of trying America.
We believe we are correct in stating that the Theatre is to be conducted
for the future by the Early Closing Association.
RAILWAY SIR ANDREW AGNEWS.
HE Directors of the Edinburgh and Glasgow
Railway refuse to carry passengers on a
Sunday, but they will forward letters. We
wonder, if a person were to dress himself |
in an envelope, and put “prepaid” on
his back, whether they would refuse to
take him 7 Since the directors will not be
bound by the spirit of their agreement with
the public, it would only serve them right
to compel them by the letter.
A ROYAL OUT-AND-OUTER.
- THE strictest orders have recently been
s given by HER MAJESTY to all the royal
servants, that if any one of the name of
Louis-PHILIPPE should call, they are to be
sure to say HER MAJESTY is “Not AT HOME.”
NOTHING NEW UNDER THE SUN.
Professor Otto voN Fogg|ENRoPF, the well known Greek professor
of Göttingen, has pointed out that the ancients were certainly ac-
quainted with gun-cotton. The shirt of Nessus, which burnt poor
HERCULEs to death, must evidently have been made of this combustible.
TREATMENT OF PICTURES IN THE NATIONAL GALLERY.
- *N A
CoRREspondent of the Times has called
attention to the horrid treatment of the
pictures in the National Gallery. The
operation of cleaning has been performed
with such furious and fatal effect, that
several of the most precious figures are
made precious figures indeed. Poor “Su-
sanna" has had her eyes nearly torn out
with the sharp bristles of a scrubbing-
brush, and the elders have had all the
expression taken out of their countenances
by severe wipes with a wet towel.
“Peace and War,” by RUBENs, has been
subjected to such frequent Rubbins, that
there is scarcely any of it left ; and poor
the uninterrupted visits of the cleaners.
These unscrupulous assailants of the
Arts, have not been particular to a shade,
but have scrubbed away the most delicate
bits of scuro with the most remorseless energy. Many of the softest
pieces of colouring have been taken completely out ; and there is a
splendid “Sir Peter Lely” which has been made the object of a futile
attempt “to paint the lily” after all the splendid tints have been rudely
taken out of it.
The truth appears to be, that the charwomen employed to scrub the
floors of the National Gallery are so conscientiously anxious to do a
fair day's work, that when the boards are sufficiently scarified with the
brush, the remainder of the day is devoted to the scrubbing of the
pictures. The words “Washing and Mangling” should be legibly
inscribed over the doors of the National Gallery.
3Literarp Entelligence.
THERE is quite a rage for English Literature at present in France
Since JULEs JANIN has, according to his own representation, “im-
proved” RICHARDson, and ALExANDRE DUMAs has added another scene
to Hamlet, the mania for similar improvements has seized every author.
We have been permitted to announce the following works, which are
in active preparation :-
DE BALzAc is about to modernise Paradise Lost. It will be published
in feuilletons in Le Boudoir, and afterwards dramatised by himself for
the Vaudeville.
Monsieur: JULEs FEvaL, the wonderful author of the Mystères de
Londres, has the continuation of Don Juan just ready. He has written,
likewise, an English version of it, so that it may be incorporated with
ByRon's Works. He is likewise correcting Walker's Dictionary up
to the present period.
OLD NICK, in collaboration with MonsLEUR EUGENE SUE and the
CoMTEsse CRAsh, have promised to rewrite the Waverley Novels. A
volume is to be published every week. The first is to be Monsieur
Ivanhoe.
Monsieur THIERs, it is reported, will edit the forthcoming numbers
of the Quarterly, and ALFRED DE WIGNY has promised to write a
novel for the New Monthly, to be called Seven Dials, which is to be a
continuation of his Cinq Mars, only the scene will be in Somers Town.
Monsieur JULEs JANIN is about to establish an English Review in
Paris. It is to be called Le Boule-dogue.
MADAME GEORGEs SAND intends translating, with the help of
“English in Six Lessons,” the complete works of BEN Jonson. They
are announced as comprising Rasselas, Calebs in search of a Wife, Every
Man out of Humour, and My Poll, and my Partner Joe. They have
been sold ; though MADAME GEoRGEs AURORA SAND has not begun
taking her lessons yet, to the Blague newspaper for 2,000,000 francs.
The Rage.
It is the fashion now for each class to wear a distinctive shirt. The
sailor has a pink yacht stamped on his, the huntsman a red fox, the
jockey an Eclipse, the “gent,” or young man about town, a blue ballet
girl standing on one leg, with very short petticoats, whilst the clerk
still remains faithful to the broad lines ruled, as the old joke runs, with
red and black ink. If this rage for illustrated shirts continues, a man
will be known, not by the company he keeps, but by the shirt he puts
on. The proverb henceforth will be, “Show me the shirt a man wears,
and I will tell you what he is.”
NAVAL REFoRM.—ORDERs have been given to allow tobacco as for-
merly to the men in the Queen's ships while lying in harbour. The
attempt to put the sailors' pipes out has consequently ended in smoke.

O F. R A M S GATE-
A RAMSGATE STREET IN November, 1846.
"THERE are certain towns which, like dormice, only enjoy life during
the warm weather. They sleep through the entire winter. Ramsgate
is at present in the drowsy transition state. The town is preparing
itself for its hibernal nap. At the first intimation of cold, the East
Cliff packed up its trunks and took the steamer to London. The West
Cliff was missing after the first fog, and all the squares, crescents,
Mount Pleasants, and numberless Bellevues ran away directly fires
came in. There is scarcely a house, not even a first floor, left. The
streets have closed their eyes for the season, and might appropriately
sing in chorus “We’re a noddin’.” The only life about the place is
evinced in its handbills. Everything else is dead—very dead. You
expect every minute to hear the town snoring, and are afraid of cough-
ing, for fear of disturbing the peace of Echo. The libraries are sleeping
off the agitation of the summer. Every now and then sounds of “one,
two, three, four, five, six—all vacant l” are heard to issue from their
yawning doors, betraying the uneasy nature of their dreams. The
lodging-house keepers are lying in ambush in their back kitchens,
and are living upon the spoils of the summer till they renew their
depredations with the next spring. The bathing machines are all laid
up, They have been sent to the Infirmary.

AN enthusiast in the Isle of Man—probably the celebrated Calf of
Man we have lately read of—has advertised for a number of poems on
the Wellington Statue. We have no doubt all the first poets of the
day will contribute to the collection, and indeed the following specimen
by the Poet BUNN has already reached us. It is in the same graceful
style of abandon that has won for him the bay leaf of renown, and
twined his brows with the night-cap of immortality.
“When upwardly with silent gaze
We seek the placid air,
And memory with the past surveys
The charm that is not there ;
When heroes that have bravely died,
Shall take a peaceful course—
What fiend shall venture to deride
The Statue on the Horse?
'Tis true there have been higher aims
Than those we sought in vain;
But what are those forgotten names
We must not speak again 2
The time may come when pensive eyes
Shall shed the tears of force l
But recollection still replies—
The Statue on the Horse.”
FRIENDLY ADVICE.
SINCE the establishment of public washing places, there cannot be a

A NEW FINANCIAL DODGE.
A cuRIOUs financial dodge has recently been practised at the expense
of the drivers of the Metropolitan omnibuses. They take out their
licences to drive along a certain road—say from Kennington, through
Piccadilly and Fleet-street, to the Bank. To this route they are com-
pelled to confine themselves, or incur a penalty of twenty pounds by
going out of it. Some one comes suddenly with pickaxes, gas-pipes,
or water-mains, to pluck up the pavement of Fleet-street or Piccadilly,
and the omnibuses licenced for those places are sent round, at a con-
siderable loss of passengers, to Holborn or Oxford-street.
A person from the office of the Solicitor of Stamps observes one of
the 'buses off the beat for which it is licensed, and straightway an infor-
mation is laid against the driver, on the ground of his having incurred
a penalty of twenty pounds. If this scheme can be successfully carried
out, the Whigs will have a very large source of revenue that was never
before thought of, and the advantage of it is, that as the streets are
always in the hands of the paviors, the revenue is very likely to be
permanent. The great objection to the scheme is its liability to be
abused by an understanding between the paving people and the Govern-
ment. The former can always harass the omnibus drivers by sending
them out of their line, while the latter can always come down upon
them for their penalties.
A Son of the Soil. **
A PERson, with the appropriate name of SELF, has opposed effectually
the introduction of Baths and Wash-houses for the poor of Shoreditch.
Dirt is probably the genius loci, for there is something in the very name
of Shore-ditch that seems hostile to cleanliness. We recommend those
of the inhabitants, who are opposed to the Selfish policy, to take the
earliest opportunity of washing their hands of it. We wonder if the
gentleman who is so greatly opposed to cleanliness among the people is
an advocate for having a clean conscience.
THE REAL RAILWAY KING.
AN engine on the Eastern Counties Railway is called “The Railway
King,” being surmounted by an imperial crown. It has been suggested
that this symbol of sovereignty would be more appropriate if the title
were altered to “King Death.”
A Matrimonial Order,
BygonE monarchs have made a reputation by founding certain
Orders. Louis-PHILIPPE—to commemorate his success as a match-
maker—proposes to found a Hymeneal Order, to be called “The Order
of the Blazing Torch.” The principal obligation of the knights will be
to take no wife without a dower.
THE NAPOLEON OF SNUFF.
IN consequence of the number of boxes given away by Louis-
PHILIPPE to the Spanish Court, snuff has gone up in Madrid three
hundred per cent. His Majesty has quite Iago's notion of the magna-
nimity of the Spaniards when he gives them snuff-boxes, and thinks
them “led by the nose as asses are.”

THE ENGLISH IN LITTLE.
BY GENERAL TOM THUMB.
THE General—we expected it all along—has written a book upon
us. A small but very pithy volume. Ere this, men have written
prayers and homilies in a space no larger than the circle of a silver
penny. The General, with characteristic minuteness, has painted
England and the English in little—so little that it might be contained
in the round of a Pennsylvanian dollar. Of course, when the words
enshrined in this delicate calligraphy—executed with pen from hum-
ming-bird—are reproduced in printer's type, they will make a small
volume. The original manuscript has, in the handsomest manner,
been forwarded by the General to PRINCE ALBERT to wear as a watch-
paper. We therefore, as we humbly conceive, confer a national benefit
in making that public which, otherwise, could only be accessible to the
elect. Lords and ladies might, possibly, by privilege of their position,
be enabled to gratify their intense and very natural, anxiety to know
what GENERAL ToM THUMB really thought of them. They might
pray an audience of the Prince, to read his watch-paper. But are
there not thousands—millions, who like those far-seeing women,
the Weird Sisters, could as soon “look into the seeds of time” as
behold the literary treasure consigned to the royal chronometer ?
Therefore, for the millions we clothe ToM THUMB's thoughts with
printer's inky suit.
We knew the General must become an author. He could not do
otherwise, from the contact of the society he daily suffered, than con-
ceive a book. We saw him—small flesh and blood dot of humanity—
ere he was bronzed, or rather gilt, by public exhibitions. We had the
honour to precede, ay, royalty and nobility, in our introduction to
GENERAL THUMB. We were admitted to his privacy; and shall
never forget the artless manner with which he played with certain five
shilling pieces, accidentally left upon the table : shall never forget
the innocent looks and tones of silver thread with which he assured
us that “when he'd got enough of them dollars, he'd buy a watch
with 'em ; tarnation smart.” Ingenuous homunculus ! But then, not
a thorough courtier, he had not trod the floors of palaces, and there-
fore was not inordinately proud of his littleness.
A golden change came on. The General sang and danced hornpipes
to the smiles of royalty, and—like Sinbad's lumps of flesh—was stuck
about with precious jewels : gifts of the lords and ladies of the land.
And then, we say, THUMB grew, and rapidly, into an author.
Did the reader ever watch the daily progress of a gosling 2 When
it has chipped the shell—the kindly wall of lime that for weeks has
kept it from a troublous world of spits, and sage and onions—and finds
its feet upon a treacherous earth, waddling like an animated lump of
flannel—or swimming, as a ball of worsted would swim upon the
waters—beautiful and innocent is that fleecy hosiery-look of the small,
faintly-whistling new comer ! Nothing so innocent. A victim to the
English climate, it may be struck with sudden cramp ; when with no
ado at all, SARAH the maid will carry the little sufferer in her bosom,
warming back its damnited activity. A week, a fortnight, and the
gosling-flannel takes a courser texture ; its woolliness subsides, at the
best, into flannel much worn. Another and another week, and you
see—plainly behold than—the insidious pen feathers begin to shoot
from either wing. That seeming innocent thing is already a terrible
magazine ; it begins to grow quills. instruments, that in due season,
may make men weep and laugh ; and like the plectrum touching the
lyre, awaken sleeping harmonies in human heart-strings.
Reader, that gcling—that innocent, flannel gosling—was Tom
THUMB. That qu'l-bearing animal is now the General. He has
written a book. H. has achieved—“THE ENGLISH IN LITTLE l’”
The world may le surprised at this. We are not. We were sure
it would come. The inspiration was the natural influence of the cir-
cumstances tha. e.vironed the General. He saw so much, his little
heart could not ontain it ; and so all ran out upon paper. No
wonder : what hesaw was eno gh to turn a giant into a human cuttle-
fish, and make Gliah flow with ink.
It is a very cuious fact—too curious, perhaps, to obtain due consi-
deration of a nition of gold-washers—that authorship did certainly
stop ToM THUM's growth. His parents and guardians were, natu-
rally enough, beaming a little uneasy at the expansion of their charge.
The General's tailor looked grave. Buttons had to be advanced
almost the sixtenth of an inch ; betokening growing abdomen. Trow-
sers had to be ower d, as the tailor graphically had it, “about the
blackness of hisnail.” We say it —ToM THUMB's dearest well-wishers
felt very uncor.ortal le. It was suggested by one anxious friend, that
if the General's trowsers were fitted with stout, strong, leather straps,
they might possibly stop his growth–for with him to grow was to be
lost ; even as to puff a bubble too much is to burst it.
We repeat it : it was an anxious time for the parents and lovers of
the curious. Who could say ? As boys who seem dwarfed dunces at
school, when unconfined, rapidly grow into men of genius, so contrarily,
might ToM THUMB, making up for lost time, take a fatal start and
lose his genius as a pigmy, by becoming merely a common man. With
this thought, he was rarely permitted to sit or stand by a window ;
lest light through glass should act upon him as upon a cucumber,
and draw him rapidly to his fullest length.
At this critical time, ToM THUMB sat down to his book. Not only
was his growth checked from that very moment, but—surely an un-
common case—his book completed, he was really a smaller creature
than when he took up his quill. Possibly, there might be something
in the contents of the book that accounted for this ; for, be it known,
the General tells all his experiences. We think this a little ungallant:
and yet—no, we cannot say. For if ladies will crowd and scuffle with
one another, and almost snap stay-laces to kiss the smallest of agentle-
man in public—merely because he is the smallest—loving lap-dogs for
no less reason ; why, human vanity cannot be expected to go to its
grave with its finger on its lip. It will publish its nectarine triumphs!
The General's book, however—and we propose to give a chapter
every week until the whole shall be published—has much graver
matter than kissing in it ; grave as that sometimes is, in this weak
world of lips. The General, in his “ENGLISH IN LITTLE,” discusses
everything dear to the bosom of a free-born Briton. Our constitution,
our government, our social institutions, our virtues, our vices, our lite-
rature, our drama—and here the General is a great authority, for did
he not act with the feminine pillars of the modern theatre—(pillars in
the very best silk stockings?)—our fashionable life, or rather, as it
is called, “the world !” And when it is remembered that this very
select world is carefully made out of a huge world—in the same way
that, having made a marble out of an eighteen-inch globe, all but the
chosen taw should go for waste, nothing—the reader may expect from
the General's book the most delicious revealings.
However, we will no further anticipate. The English have idolised
a dwarf; and the pigmy, duly returning the compliment, paints
“THE ENGLISH IN LITTLE.”

THE SNOBS OF ENGLAND.
BY ONE OF THEMSELVES.
CHAPTER XXXVII.-ON SOME COUNTRY SNOBS.
At last came that fortunate day at the Evergreens, when I was to
be made acquainted with some of the “county families" with whom
only people of Ponto's rank condescended to associate. And now,
although poor Ponto had just been
so cruelly made to bleed bn occasion
of his son's new uniform, and
though he was in the direst and
most cut-throat spirits with an
overdrawn account at the banker's,
and other pressing evils of poverty; \ |
although a tenpenny bottle of \,\!
Marsala and an awful parsimony
presided generally at his table, yet
the poor fellow was obliged to as-
sume the most frank and jovial air
of cordiality; and all the covers
being removed from the hangings,
and new dresses being procured for
the young ladies, and the family
plate being unlocked and displayed,
the house and all within assumed
a benevolent and festive appear-
ance. The kitchen fires began to
blaze, the good wine ascended from
the cellar, a professed cook actually
came over from Guttlebury to
compile culinary abominations.
STRIPEs was in a new coat, and
so was Ponto, for a wonder, and
country brethren, at least we amuse each other more ; if we bore our-
selves, we are not called upon to go ten miles to do it !
For instance, the HiPsley's came ten miles from the south, and the
HAwbucks ten miles from the north, of the Evergreens ; and were
magnates in two different divisions of the County of Mangelwurzel-
shire. HIPsley, who is an old baronet, with a bothered estate, did
not care to show his contempt for HAwbuck, who is a new creation,
and rich. HAwBUck, on his part, gives himself patronising airs to
GENERAL SAGo, who looks upon the Pontos as little better than
paupers. “Old LADY BLANCHE,” says Ponto, “I hope will leave
something to her god-daughter—my second girl—we've all of us
half-poisoned ourselves with taking her physic.”
LADY BLANCHE and LADY Rose FitzAGUE have, the first, a
medical, and the second a literary turn. I am inclined to believe the
former had a wet compresse around her body, on the occasion when I
had the happiness of meeting her. She doctors everybody in the
neighbourhood, of which she is the ornament ; and has tried every-
thing on her own person. She went into Court, and testified pub-
licly her faith in St. John LoNG : she swore by Doctor Bucha N,
she took quantities of GAMBouge's Universal Medicine, and whole
boxfulls of PARR's Life Pills. She has cured a multiplicity of head-
aches by SQINstone's eyesnuff; she wears a picture of HAHNEMANN
in her bracelet and a lock of PRIEssNITz's hair in a brooch. She
talked about her own complaints and those of her confidante for the
time being, to every lady in the room successively, from our hostess
down to Miss WIRT, taking them into corners, and whispering
about bronchitis, hepatitis, St. Vitus, neuralgia, cephalalgia, and so
forth. I observed poor fat LADY HAwbuck in a dreadful alarm after
some communication regarding the state of her daughter Miss Lucy
HAwbuck's health, and MRs. SAGo turn quite yellow, and put down
her third glass of Madeira, at a warning glance from LADY BLANche.
LADY lºose talked literature, and about the boºk-club at Guttlebury,
and is very strong in voyages and travels. She has a prodigious
interest in Borneo, and displayed a knowledge of the history of the
Punjaub and Kaffirland that does credit to her memory. Old

The great Ponto party was a very august one. The HAwbucks |*ence offered a tract as he was walking over Crackshins Common, and
came in their family coach, with the blood-red hand emblazoned
all over it , and their man in yellow livery waited in country
fashion at table, only to be exceeded in splendour by the HIPsleys,
the opposition baronet, in light blue. The old LADIEs FitzAGUE
drove over in their little old chariot with the fat black horses, the
fat coachman, the fat footman,—(why are dowagers' horses and foot-
men always fat 7) And soon after these personages had arrived, with
their auburn fronts and red beaks and turbans, came the Honour ABLE
AND REveREND Lionel PETTIPois, who with GENERAL and MRs. SAGo,
formed the rest of the party. “Lord and LADY FREDERIck Howler
were asked, but they have friends at Ivybush,” Mrs. Ponto told
me; and that very morning, the CAstleh AggARDs sent an excuse, as
her ladyship had a return of the quinsy. Between ourselves, LADY
CASTLEHAGGARD's quinsy always comes on when there is dinner at
the Evergreens.
If the keeping of polite company could make a woman happy, surely
my kind hostess MRs. Ponto was on that day a happy woman. Every
person present (except the unlucky impostor who pretended to a con-
nexion with the SNoBBINGToN Family, and GENERAL SAgo, who had
. home I don't know how many lacs of rupees from India,) was |
related to the Peerage or the Baronetage. MRs. P. had her heart's
desire. If she had been an Earl's daughter herself, could she have | ~%
expected better company ?—and her family were in the oil-trade at -T.
Bristol, as all her friends very well know. º
What I complained of in my heart was not the dining—which, for $/_
this once, was plentiful and comfortable enough—but the prodigious - -
dulness of the talking part of the entertainment. O, my beloved

PUNCH'S AMENDE HONORABLE,
SoME weeks ago, Punch read a letter addressed to his Monaghan
tenantry by John EvelyN SHIRLEY, M.P. He commented on that
letter, which purported to be an answer to applications for advice and
assistance, but which really resolved itself into an exhortation to pay
rent. He knew nothing of MR. SHIRLEY but his letter. His comments
had reference to that only. On the face of it the letter justified the
comments. He is assured, on good authority, that MR. SHIRLEY has
no right to the place which Punch, judging him by his letter, assigned
to him. MR. Shirley is declared to be a good landlord, residing on
his Irish property four months of every year—to have been supplying
his tenants with Indian meal for the last twelvemonth, at a rate below
market price, and—not waiting for the aid of Government Acts—to
have given his agent directions to set the poor on his estate to work.
For several weeks every distressed tenant and cottier has been
employed at a rate ranging from a shilling to sixteenpence a day.
Punch regrets that Mr. SHIRLEY's letter was not more carefully
expressed, or that, being so loosely expressed, it was made public. MR.
Shirley acts like a good landlord, but writes like a bad one. Punch
judged him by his writing, not knowing him by his acts. If he be what
our informant describes him, he does his duty. This is a virtue in
Ireland, and Punch recognises it as such, in MR.SHIRLEY's case, with cor-
dial pleasure. The rare discovery of a good landlord in Ireland recon-
ciles Punch to the still rarer discovery of a harsh judgment in himself.
A Sign of the Times.
It seems that the house in which SHARspeARE was born is to be
sold. This is a symptom of the declining interest that is felt in the
Bard of Avon. His spirit used to hover round the abode ; but the
spirit having gone over to Paris for change of air, the premises are
vacant, and will be knocked down to the highest bidder.
A.GREAT CoMFont.—A tremendous fog on the 3rd rendered the
Wellington Statue quite invisible.
THE LOST FOG.
SoME surprise was manifested in London at the sudden disappearance
of all symptoms of an intense fog that had prevailed a few days before;
and it was only on our reading a paragraph in a country paper, that
we read the fact of the London fog having arrived at Birmingham.
We perceive, from the journal we allude to, that there prevailed in that
town a mist as dense and decided as ever darkened the metropolis. It
was called in the paragraph a real London fog, and it must have been
a genuine town-made, for, with all their skill in manufactures, it would
be impossible to produce a similar article in Birmingham. It must
have gone down overnight by the heavy goods' train on the Railway.
It was remarked that the fog made for the Northern part of the Me-
tropolis on the night when it appeared in London; and after going
up Tottenham Court Road, it turned off to the right towards Euston
Square, where it hovered over the railway terminus, for it was not seen
in any part of the Hampstead Road, and must have quitted London by
the route we have alluded to.

Horse-Radish for the Million.
AMONG the enormous benefits of Free Trade, is a tremendous influx
of horse-radish, which is arriving daily by ship-loads at the Custom
House. Getting the horse-radish is one step towards getting the roast
beef to eat with it. This is like a friend of ours, who has got a
. book, and now wants nothing to make it complete but a large
balance.
A BROTHERLY DIFFERENCE.
A PROvINCIAL paper says “There is a sensible difference between the
letters of MR. GRANTLEY BERKELEY and his brother.” It is the only
thing, then, in the difference between them, that is sensible.

R THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE ENGLISH IN LITTLE.
BY GENERAL TOM THUMIb.
TOM THUMB IN PRIVATE LODGINGS-INVITED TO THE PALACE.
WHEN I was first brought to England, Gover Nor BARNUM showed
me on the stage of a playhouse for two or three nights ; just, as he
said, to give the stupid Britishers such a tarnation small taste of me,
that they should be all the hungrier for it.
And then the Governor kept me so private in private lodgings, that
not above a hundred of his private friends came every day to see me.
“And where did you get the General?” asked everybody. And then,
Governor BARNUM putting one of his hands in his pocket, poked out
the t'other at full length, and said—“The General, when I first found
him, was a drug in the family, quite a drug.” Whether the Governor
meant salts or senna—for I guess I’ve taken both—I can't say. But
if I’ve remained a drug, considering how the Britishers have swallowed
me, they must have been tarnation physicked.
And after a good many days, the Governor having writ a letter to
MRs. Victori A–the Britishers call her—yes, poor critters 1 they do
—HER GRAcious MAJESTY ; but I, who am a citizen of the smartest
nation of all creation, I who look upon Well, I’m smart, I calculate,
and so will say HER GRAcious MAJESTY. Well, the Governor having
writ his letter, went, every time there was a knock at the door, to the
winder, to see if MRS.–I mean if HER GRAcious MAJESTY hadn’t
sent her best coach for him and me, that is, for the kit of us. Many
days went over, and there was no royal knock, and no coach with the
royal cream and curds-and-whey horses. At last, Governor BARNUM
being terrible riled to be sure, said to me—“General,” says he.
“Governor,” says I.
“MRs. Victoria,” says he—he always called her ‘GRAcious
MAJESTY' afore Britishers, though he always winked tarnation at me
as he did it—“MRs. VicToRIA,” says he, “has not answered the letter
I writ her.”
“P'raps,” says I, “poor critter, she can't write,”—for, being a true
American, I like to take Queens down a peg. “Poor critter l’” I said
agin, “p'raps she can't write.” -
“Gen'ral,” said Governor BARNUM, “she can write : it’s provided
by the British Constitution and the law that all critters with crowns
upon their heads must be taught to write; or the Government would

“I should think not,” said I ; and as I said it, I alarmed the Gover-
nor ; for I looked as if I’d growed an inch.-‘‘I should think not,”

“Well, then,” said he “you are the greatest, brightest star of that
banner; and she has not writ an answer ; she has insulted you.”
Well, I do confess it : my blood begin to bile ; and I felt like a lit-
tle copper tea-kettle that I've seen the Britishers put upon the table
with a lamp under it, for grog; I felt a lamp under me at that mo-
ment, my inside a wobbling, and the steam a coming out of my
mouth. “I am a star, Governor,” said I : “I know my brightness,
and feel myself twinkle.”
“Well, then,” said the Governor, “what a wife does, her husband
must also answer for.”
“To be sure,” says I ; “that's why the weddin'-ring's made round
to hoop 'em both.”
“Well, then,” said the Governor, “as we're insulted, I shall write
to MR. ALBERT to satisfy me as a gentleman. I never travel without
the necessaries of life, and I’ve brought my Kentucky rifle.”
“You’re a beauty, Governor,” says I: “you have brains enough to
set up a forest o' monkeys on their hind legs as shopkeepers, and
make 'em cheat one another like Christians.”
“None o' your soft sawder, General,” said the Governor : “my
stomach's weak, and can't stand it. I shall write to MR. ALBERT in
the name o’ the star-spangled banner, to come out with me, in his
wife's own Hyde Park, for early bullets.”

EveRY scheme appeared to have been exhausted for devising a new
style of Railway, until a plan, to which we are about to allude, was
happily hit upon. We have had suggestions of subterranean Railways,
to go tunnelling through our coal-cellars, and viaducting over our
balconies ; but these might have caused inconvenience, which will be
altogether prevented by the new Shop-Ledge Line, which is to be
obtained by making all the shop-ledges in the same street of an equal
altitude. The vehicles may be ordinary vehicles, with a sort of tele-
scopic axletree, made to draw in and out at pleasure, so as to be accom-
modated to the width of the thoroughfare. This plan would cause
considerable relief to the over-crowded streets, if tried in some of the
most frequented parts of the city; for a traffic could be going on over-
head, simultaneously with that on the lower level. The expenses
of the construction of such a line would be exceedingly moderate, as it
would only be necessary for each shareholder to raise or lower, the
ledge over the window on the ground-floor to the same height as those
of his next-door neighbours. It would not be necessary to purchase
any ground, except for the purposes of termini. Had such a thing
been proposed a year ago, the applications for shares would have been
overwhelming. As it is, we think there may be a fair demand, if the
scheme is properly advertised.

TALES FOR THE MARINES.
TALE THE NINTH.
otARIEs of MARs and NEPTUNE, hearken;
though you are about to listen to what
does not much concern you. With
taxes you are scarcely more acquainted
than footmen ; and perhaps you are
hardly aware that you are indebted to
them for the liberal daily remuneration
with which a grateful Government re-
ºwards your services. You are probably,
however, aware of the fact, that the
terrestrial people of this country do pay
taxes; and that the weight of taxation
is distributed, rather unequally, upon
their shoulders. In one very important
particular, however, the taxes are now
to be equitably adjusted.
# It may not be unknown to you that
among the most objectionable of these
same taxes, is that which is levied on the light of Heaven. The
window-tax is one of the heaviest articles in the panniers of the public
donkey. That patient animal is at length to be relieved of this load,
which has so intolerably oppressed him. You would like to know by
what means.
Learn, then, that the great landowners and capitalists have come
forward in a body, and unanimously petitioned LoRD John RUSSELL,
as soon as Parliament meets, to repeal the window-tax, showing forth
the interference of this impost with the comfort and convenience of
the middling and lower classes, and dwelling on the benefit which will
be conferred on the glass trade by the grant of cheap windows to the
million. Now to this much-wanted measure of relief there is only one
objection : the loss of revenue which would result from it. But,
thoughtful men they have obviated this difficulty; and how, think
you ? Ah you will never guess.
You are to be informed that the legacy-duty is not levied on property
above a certain amount, and that freehold estates are exempt from it
altogether. The capitalists and landowners have nobly proposed, that
to render practicable the repeal of the window-tax, all property what-
ever shall henceforth pay legacy-duty in exact proportion to its value.
And to their proposal to the Prime Minister, they add an apology for
the people for never having thought of this expedient before ; assuring
them that it was not by any selfish consideration that they have
hitherto been blinded to it. This you at least will believe, generous
Marines. Well the Premier has promised to attend to their sug-
gestion ; and before six months are over our heads, the tax-gatherer
will no longer stand between the British public and the sunshine ; or

The Wellington Statue.
THE Times has stood in its own broad sheet, with a taper in its hand,
and done very handsome penance for its abuse of the WELLINGTON
bronze. It is content that the Duke should stand where he is ; for,
“supposing the Statue to be taken down—what is to be done with it?”
We are happy to step in to remove the dilemma; inasmuch as
MADAME Tussaud has privately expressed to us her willingness to
right to exhibit it for just what it is worth ; namely, the very smallest
piece of congenial copper.
A SHOCKING ExPEDIENT.
A chEMIST at Berlin has manufactured an electric paper, more

ST. GEORGE AND THE DRAGON.
MINT Y "
" ENGLAND's patron Saint has been summarily dismissed from the coin
of the realm. St. GeoRGE and his Dragon have been ordered off in the
most unceremonious manner, and have been superseded by the British
Lion, with the QUEEN in the character of BRITANNIA, accompanied by
that highly-favoured animal. This compliment to the British Lion is
no doubt intended as a compensation for the many insults he has
recently experienced. The poor brute was nearly broken in spirit by
the abolition of the Gorn Laws, and will no doubt feel much revived by
his promotion to the coinage.
We must not, however, pass over in silence the harsh and unfeeling
treatment of the Dragon, who has for so many years given animation
and spirit to our five-shilling pieces and our sovereigns. Poor ST.
GEORGE will henceforth be ashamed to show his face among his
companion champions of Christendom. In contemplating the treat-
ment of St. GeoRGE and the Dragon, our feelings naturally take the
form of the following ballad —
The struggle is over, the business is done,
St. GEoRGE and the Dragon are told to begone;
From five-shilling pieces they're turned with disgrace,
And the old British Lion has taken their place.
With wild lamentations at having the sack,
St. GeoRGE throws the Dragon right over his back;
He knew that together no more they must dwell,
So at least he resolved on a friendly farewell.
He would not embitter a leave taking day,
Nor send an old Dragon in anger away;
He sees the Mint's order that bids them depart,
And he presses the brute to his sorrowful heart.
He thinks of each sov’reign, each crown that endears
The frightful companion of happier years;
BRITANNIA and Lion succeed them, I trow,
And ST.GEORGE and the Dragon are desolate now.
An Old Defaulters
MR. O'Connell has been posted again as a defaulter in the City of
Dublin. The twelvemonth's bill he gave for Repeal has become due,
and been sent back marked “No effects.” This is not the first by
many which has been dishonoured in a similar way. The honourable
gentleman has been endeavouring to renew the bill; but his credit is
so shaken, that he has great difficulty in inducing people to accept
anything.

Dyce is of opinion that in any monumental
design regard should be had to what has been
one in Germany, especially at Münich. A
monumental work, to be truly great, should com-
bine hardness of outline, squareness of compo-
horse. The hero is well enough, but Copen-
hagen had no Arab points about him. He was
not even a thorough-bred, but a useful hunter;
master of the Duke's weight, and uncommonly
safe across country. If the Committee will
have him, I wish you would suggest to my
friend Rutland the accompanying sketch. The
Duke, you know, hunted in the Peninsula, and
is a fast hand still, as Beaufort can tell you.

The Duke's Statue, above alluded to, is hard

especially are over-elaborated. W. Dyce begs
to submit to Lord MoRPETH a design to which
he thinks artists might very properly be re-
quired to conform.”

nobler sports of otter-hunting, badger-drawing, and deer-stalking.
When, too, we think of the influence of high example, we have
hopes that MARLBoRough's DUCHEss will be, in some way, imitated by
the vulgar. Hence, we do not despair to see maids-of-all-work learning
pistol-practice at the shooting-galleries, that they may bring down
spiders with small-shot instead of besoms.
A “ CHUCK" UNDER THE CHIN.
* THE whole parish of St. Pancras has happily escaped a tremendous
social blaze. Another hour, and every house-maid, nursery-maid,
maid-of-all-work, cook, kitchen-maid, and maids indescribable would
have been up in arms—that is to say, in brooms—against the vestry.
Fortunately, the matter has been settled; and the maids have subsided
from boiling-heat to simmering. The vestry-room will not be sacked,
nor the vestrymen pelted with hearth-stones. MR. PIKE has explained;
and the household virginity of St. Pancras reposes on the unsullied
reputation of its “unchucked” chin.
MR. PIKE had been canvassing for the solemn honour of vestryman;
and whilst thus patriotically employed had—it was charged against

The horrid charge was made by a very virtuous MR. Douglas,
extremely pale with the sense of wrong committed upon one, and im-
plied towards all, the servant-maids of all the vestrymen of St. Pancras.
and the champion further moved that the heinous culprit, MR. PIKE,
“be called in to explain.”
Enter MR. PIKE.. His every hair on end ; bolt upright with horror
at the charge. He is very pale, too, very pale. But a red spot—very
like a crimson wafer-burns in his either cheek, illustrating the
yirtuous indignation that is boiling in his heart. The perspiration
hangs upon his brow like morning dew upon a cabbage. Labouring
for breath—he is so oppressed by the awfulness of his situation—he at
length declares, in a voice big and bursting with the weight of truth—
“It is untrue : it is untrue. I know myself better than to be guilty of
so humiliating an act / I have more respect to myself than to chuck any
servant girl under the chin ; and, least of all, the servant of a vestry.
man of St. Pancras.”

like small beer into sand; and he was, of course, informed that he left
the vestry without a stain upon his character. The maids of St.

event that clears the reputation of the general housemaid chin of the
parish from the touch of a Pike.

NEW INSURANCE OFFICE.
A New Insurance Office is to be started to protect ladies from the
casualties of cotton. The rates will be low, having been drawn exceed-
ingly fine, in order that the commonest article of female apparel may
have the full benefit of Insurance. Gowns will be insured at so much
a dozen ; and ladies' workboxes will be charged according to the amount
of danger they may conceal—that is to say, according to the number
of balls of cotton they may contain. The Anti Explosive-Cotton-In-
surance Office states in its prospectus, that it is started expressly to
prevent ladies being blown up by their husbands. This appeal cannot
fail to insure its success ; every married lady is sure to subscribe.
A Gigantic Task.
PROFEssor Owen has, it is said, examined the remains of at least
four thousand elephants. This is no less than an elephant a day for
the last fifteen or sixteen years. We suspect there is a little exagge-

officers could not have contrived to get through an examination of
their trunks in the time which it is alleged has been all that PRoPEssoR
Owen devoted to the elephants themselves.

SMALL DEBTS ACT.---MURDEROUS ATTACK UPON
OLD “ COSTS.”
ARELY indeed, does it fall to the blissful lot of the
writers of Punch—to those happy men, who perched
upon the highest point of Mount Quill, their faces
ruddy with wine, and shining with the marrow of
the land; acutely yet most affectionately surveying
the doings of the world below, rarely, we say, does
it fall to their blessed condition to narrate the
atrocities that now and then, it is much to be
feared, do desecrate and blot this most beautiful
world. We leave house-breaking, robbery, and all
the lighter eccentricities of felony to other pens.
We seldom shake hands with the virtuous pick-
pocket, or embrace with beating heart the ingenu-
ous sheep-stealer. No, we leave their doings to be chronicled else-
where ; to be written, not in gold upon vellum, but in copper (that
is, a penny a line) upon transmuted rag. A case, however, involving
so much atrocity—a case in which the highest judicial functionary of
the land figures—disfigures would be the better word—as a daring
criminal, committing a most murderous assault upon a rich old man;
unawed by the greatness of his wealth, untouched by the hoary hairs
(the whiteness of who shall say how many years 2) upon his vene-
rable head ; by the deep, expressive lines, as though marked with
the very best iron pen and the very blackest ink, in his venerable
countenance. Such a case we must open our columns, wide as castle-
gates, to admit and pay all service and attention to.
There : we have struggled with ourselves ; and with a forced
calmness terrible to think of, we will proceed with the history of the
last criminal act of Lord CoTTENHAM, Lord Chancellor of England 1
A legal gentleman, named Costs, has been long known to all per-
sons who either as creditors or debtors to any amount under or, indeed,
over, 4:20, have gone to law for the same. In fact old Costs is so
well known, and though so very old—was so ubiquitous—that it was
impossible for a man to put his foot in any Court of Law without
seeing him. There he was, with eyes so burning hot, you almost felt
your money melt in your pocket as it came near him : with mouth so
wide, and teeth so jagged and strong, that—as men are tempted to
fling themselves off a precipice—you felt a terrible fascination, as
though you must walk, body and bones, into the mouth of that inhuman
ogre, to be chewed and chewed like the meat and gristle of a well-done
lamb, and then be passed into his cavernous stomach to be digested,
and turned to nutriment and add—though never so little—to his
flesh ; to give a still deeper yellow to his jaundiced, golden skin
Such was old Costs : nevertheless, though the world could not call
him handsome, the maternity of Law (dear old harridan 1) protects
alike the uncomely with the beautiful—Yes; even as the hen gathers
all her chickens under her wings, the very white with the very
speckled.
Costs was a very old man : in fact, we should say, “the oldest
inhabitant” was no other than he , for it is not to be recounted the
generations that he outlived, every generation more or less abusing
him, whilst Costs himself, profiting by each as it passed, danced on
its wide grave (for the old scoundrel would now and then be very
frolicsome), when departed. And as the old vagabond jumped and
capered, the gold pieces in his pockets—increasing in number–gave
louder and louder chink 1
A cruel jester was old Costs : he would write down words, and
lines, and passages, which men—ignorant men—were wont to look
upon as dimmest nonsense. And then old Costs would laugh, and
swear by all his money-bags, that you must pay for it : the less the
meaning, too, the heavier the price—it was his way; his humour, and
you must pay for the inexplicable joke—as Lucullus would pay for
his dinner, having mightily enjoyed it. As for the writing of Costs,
though black and unintelligible to the reader—he, the old wizard him-
self, had but to run the tip of his parchment finger along each line,
and lo –like vapour touched by flame—it burst into burning light :
every letter and every word spelling or in some way meaning—Gold !
And, after this fashion, Costs was a great alchemist : for men,
women, and children—generations of them, worn, tortured, crushed,
broken-hearted, were cast into his huge crucible, and, the scum flung
off—therein left gold. And Justice wept. Justice, with whom
Costs gave it out to the world he was married ; she being flesh of his
flesh and bone of his bone. The unutterable scoundrel ! He never
was married to her ; he never even lived with her. But giving it out
to the world that she was his lawful wife, committed all his atrocities
in her good and holy name : she, weeping the while, at its hourly
desecration. And CoMMon SENSE, too ; nice, good, gentle, patient
creature; she too, would weep over her wrongs, inexpressibly abused
as she was by the cannibal ogre every day.
And Costs had a very numerous family: for, indeed Costs was a
polygamist. We cannot name his children. But we know that MRs.
Chican E and MADAME SHARPRAction, and others we could speak of,
had—and hare—magnificent houses in London ; and Costs a family in
each of them. We have said it ; we cannot name his children. Ne-
vertheless the intelligent eye that reads that difficult print, the human
face—now in full, fat type, and now in most villanous italics—may
now and then recognise a few of them. They are to be known by
their black, greasy hair; black, wandering eyes ; underhanging lips ;
and goat-like noses. Sweet boys are they ; and fat with human flesh
Nevertheless, Costs, with all his sins, having the law on his side,
was to be protected. True it is, one BRough AM—and oh, beloved
HENRY 1 our beautiful, our bravel let that one great act be to you as
a wide, full robe of flowing honour to wrap about you for the venera-
tion of posterity, who, looking upon that will not behold the little,
party-coloured frills and ruffs of the now Lord MERRYMAN of the
Peers—BRough AM did once assault and do much mischief to Costs,
lessening his amount of daily food ; putting him upon shorter
commons of human marrow. Yes; BRough AM once struck down,
and sorely hurt the ogre, though not to the death. Even as the
elephant, with upflung, quivering trunk, gazes at the tiger, waiting
but for the moment to involve the beast, heave him up in the air,
then fling down again, and, with pillar-like feet, tread him into nothing
—so did our own HENRY (yes ; he may do what he will, we must
still love him for that :) threaten Costs ; so did he seize him,
shaking him, while the wretch screamed ten thousand curses, and
flinging him down, did him all the harm he could ; for Costs had
Eldon and others for friends, and the elephantine HENRY was driven
from his prey.
But now Lord CoTTENHAM, sallying forth from Wimbledon, with
his mace, inscribed “SMALL DEBTs Act,” upon his shoulder, like a
benevolent giant with his club, has set upon that aged, but thriving
wickedness, Costs. Thump-thump-thump-went the CHANCEllor;
his face looking warm and radiant with the good work; while Costs,
in the helplessness of despair, howled and howled. The cries from
“Chambers ” have been dreadful. Had another murder of the inno-
cents been going on—every innocent being strangled with red tape—
the noise would have been zephyr music to it.
And dreadfully has old Costs suffered. He has been beaten down—
(he would like to have been bent double)—and, some say, will never
get up again. Certain it is, the knight Cottenham has dealt inexorably
by him. For, in future, Costs must practise in small County Courts,
for SMALL DEBTs : Costs must not henceforth grow fat upon writs
upon petty sums, when the small debt was gulped—swallowed—by
the wide-mouthed expense. Poor Costs, when allowed to speak at
all, is to be put off with shillings where before he had pounds !
And then, the progeny that Costs begot |
Alas ! they will die like rats that have taken ground glass into
their vitals; they will wither from the face of the land, or if any
survive, they will deny their origin and family, and, it may be, turn
to an honest livelihood. Perhaps we shall see them, with still a
touching thought of their old trade, dealing with Lucifers l
Iliberality of Louis-Philippe.
The Canterbury Journal states that a French brig, lying at Erith, is
taking in a cargo of 4000 barrels of gunpowder, of English manufacture.
It is, however, the intention of Louis-Philippe—a certain event
occurring—only to borrow the same ; as he hopes to be able to return
the gunpowder to the English, with the additional compliment of lead.
A DIFFICULTY GOT OVER.
A DAY or two since, the Common Serjeant assured the Old Bailey
Court that “AlDERMAN Gibbs was as sensible a man as any in London,
although he was an Alderman.” Ought he not to have some testimonial
for remaining “sensible” under such trying difficulties How many
Aldermen sink under them :
O'Connel L’S TWO BUCKETs.
A DAY or two since, at Conciliation Hall, MR. O'Connel L said, “My
heart is full for Ireland.” May not an agitator's heart and his pocket
be sometimes like two buckets at a well; the one becoming “full” as
the other becomes empty 2

It is a great pity that a mere game of chance should be played with all the forms and
technicalities of a matter of solemn certainty. The issue of sentences among Old Bailey
criminals is so decidedly regulated by luck, that it is quite absurd to dole them out with the
form and ceremony of judicial investigation and sound discretion. It has therefore been
proposed to save trouble by establishing a lottery, in which there shall be penalties of every
degree, and which shall be drawn for promiscuously at every sessions by all the convicted
prisoners. This will act as an excellent warning, for badly-disposed persons will be deterred
from even the smallest crimes, by the recollection that they may chance to draw from the
lottery one of the severest sentences.
The present plan of distributing punishment, is a lottery in everything but name; and
there can be no impropriety, therefore, in openly
adopting a principle which is now less straight-
forwardly acted upon. One of the old lottery
contractors might be engaged to put the matter
in train, and start it fairly off, after which it
would become a matter of routine, easily intelli-
gible to the meauest capacities. The Ushers
of the Court, or even the Aldermen, might
then contrive to work it effectually.
OFFICIAL CONDESCENSION.
WE perceive by the hills of Astley's amphi-
theatre that MR. BATTY has succeeded in
engaging no less a personage than “the Master
of the Horse of the KING of PRUssia,” who
is nightly putting a highly-trained charger
through a series of graceful evolutions, for the
amusement of the audience. We are afraid the
salaries of the official dignitaries of the Prussian
Court must be on a very wretched scale, to
render it worth the while of the Master of the
Horse to eke out his income by an engagement
at Astley's, Fancy the Duke of Norfolk
going over to Paris, and being advertised to
appear at FRANGoni's in the capacity of Master
of the Horse to HER MAJEsty The QUEEN of
ENGLAND, with a magnificent palfrey from the
royal stables. If it is to become the practice
for official personages to appear at the theatres
of other countries, and go through perform-
ances of any kind for the diversion of the
public, the principle may be most extensively
acted on. Perhaps an ex-official, having more
leisure, might take advantage of the precedent
furnished by the Master of the Horse of the
KING of PRUssia. Sir Robert PEEL, for
instance, would produce a wondrous effect if he
were to engage himself at the Cirque Olympique
as the late Premier of the British Queen,
accompanied by a highly-trained M.P., who
could be put through a series of wonderful evo-
lutions at the will of the Ex-Minister.
Equestrian Anatomy.
A VETERINARY Surgeon writes to inquire
what kind of a horse the DUKE is riding on the
triumphal arch is supposed to be. He says he
has dissected it with his eye, and the following
are the particulars of its singular anatomy:—
The head is an unicorn's ; the nostrils are
those of a pig i the eyes are policemen's bull's-
eyes ; and the carcass is that of a prize cow.
Its tail is taken from the circus, and the stiffness
of its legs is evidently borrowed from the
clothes'-horse. In short, its parts are so hete-
rogeneous that he does not know what to call
it, unless it is “au omnibus horse in high keep.”
THE POPE AND HIS SWISS GUARDS.
A corkespond ENT in the Daily News says
the Pope is mightily troubled, and knows not
how to get rid of his ten thousand Swiss. We
can assist him in his difficulty. Let him re-
commend them as valets to the English aristo-
cracy.

A HOME FOR THE STATUE.
THERE seems to be a difficulty in finding a home for the Wellington
Statue. “Avaunt, and quit my sight !” appears to be the involuntary
exclamation of every one who stands in its overwhelming presence.
The monster bids fair to become the Wandering Jew of public statues,
unless a permanent home can be found for it. We have a suggestion to
make, which we think will give rest to the wanderer. Instead of the
two horseboxes for mounting guard in Parliament Street, let one be
made in their stead sufficiently commodious for the reception of the
Duke on horseback. He will thus serve a double purpose, for he will
certainly frighten away the little boys just as well as the two gallant
fellows who now sit with drawn swords for the intimidation of rebellious
urchins, and he will possess the advantage of not being so attractive to
the nursery-maids, and causing such an obstruction of the footpath as
the living military occasion.
Perhaps, however, the strongest argument of all for the adoption of
our plan is, that the gates of the horse-boxes are closed at four o'clock,
and consequently after dark the Statue would never be visible. This
would prevent the possibility of alarm being occasioned to those whose
nerves are not strong enough to bear the infliction of a frightful spec-
tacle after the shadows of eve have once descended.

The following promotions were somehow omitted in the Gazette :-

“Mr. Punch,
“Nor being able to write myself, I employ the foot of a humble
friend of mine, a learned pig-at the present moment in treaty with
the folks of Egyptian Hall—to vindicate the rights of my order. Last
Lord Mayor's Day, an ox, proceeding through the City, knocked
down and trampled upon one child—whilst another ox tossed another.
Whereupon certain editors—I’m told they’re called—cry out for that
un-English establishment an abattoir. In a word, they would have us
whirled up by rail to some obscure outskirt of the town, and there
slaughtered, before we had seen a bit of London life.
“Now, Mr. Punch, I do not object to my lot. I eat my grass, my
turnips, and my oil-cake contentedly for the benefit of man, well
knowing that I am streaking my sirloin with marbly fat—I believe he
calls it—not for myself, but for him. I can even look upon horse-
radish with dry eyes, though full well knowing that some day we shall
come together. But, Mr. Punch, if beef has its duties, it also has its
rights. I come of a metropolitan stock. All my family for generations
upwards, have supplied the Smithfield market; they have all had
their comfortable, leisurely stare at London shops and London people,
on their way to the Beef Exchange, Smithfield. (The bull who so
famously distinguished himself in a china-shop, was my ancestor.)
And, I ask it, are we for the sake of a few lives—or a few broken
limbs per annum on the part of the human family, a family whom we
feed—to be knocked upon the head in our ignorance: killed in a hole or
corner; without one glance at ourselves in London plate-glass; without
tossing two or three children; maiming an old woman or so, and
making well-dressed nervous females squeal, and run into a shop, as if
with a frighted conscience, when they only see so much as the tips of
our horns.
“But, as my friend the pig suggests, some of you reforming gentry
having done away with the gridirons in Smithfield, would now, to finish
the matter, abolish the beef.
“Howsomever, unless I’m allowed to have my lounge up Bridge
Street, with a little frisk up Fleet Street or up Ludgate Hill, on my
way through Farringdon—a dodge or so up Snow Hill—tossing a
quaker, or perhaps killing outright one or two of the very lowest orders
—unless I’m allowed the enjoyment of what I've always been taught
to consider my vested rights, I'll have my revenge ; for let 'em try to
feed and cramme as they will, when I get to the butcher's I’m deter-
mined to cut up precious lean ; and so I remain,
“Yours, Mr. Punch, (either in steak or sirloin),
“Young BULL.
*P.S. If, Mr. Punch, you are in any doubt of the justice of my
claims, and would wish to decideit, once and for all, I have no objection
to give you a toss for it.”
GOOD NEWS FOR ANGLERS.
1THIN a few days ago the basins at Trafalgar
Square underwent a thorough cleansing, when
a quantity of eels were discovered at the bottom.
This fact opens out a very considerable prospect
2, in a commercial sense, for it gives promise of a
ſ possible extension of our fisheries. The idea of
3% having an eel reservoir in the very heart of the
v metropolis is a “great fact” in piscatory annals.
* We see a hundred ways in which this discovery
*** may be turned to advantage. The “right of
* =% fishery” may be rendered profitable by letting it
yº to those disciples of old Isaac WALTon who
WNS are desirous of enjoying a quiet angle without
S *... London. Such an arrangement would be
much more satisfactory than the present practice
of rushing out of town, and sitting in a punt for
hours catching nothing. The certainty of the
supply of eels in the waters of Trafalgar Square
will prevent the disappointment which some-
| times arises to the lovers of the sport from the
deficiency of the finny tribe in the usual places
resorted to for the purpose of fishing.
We have no doubt that the Trafalgar eels will
become exceedingly popular, and will be eventually formidable rivals
to the Greenwich whitebait and the Yarmouth herrings.
SPLENDID effects.
ALExAndre DUMAs has received at Madrid the Grand Cross of
Charles IIL, making somewhere about the fiftieth cross he has received
in his lifetime. When this BBLAREUs of literature opens his theatre,
he will never be at a loss to give a new piece plenty of decorations.

Now I should not so much mind the ‘pretty inno-

FLOOD OF CHRISTMAS BOOKS.
THE Literature of England promises, or rather threatens, to be inundated this year
with a flood of Christmas Books. Every little author is preparing a five-shilling volume
in imitation of the Christmas Carol. The following list will best show the absurdity and
meanness of the present copying system :— ”
THE PLUM Pupping ; a Tale in five Slices.
Charwomen of England.” Price 5s.
THE PEwten on THE Hob : A Fairy Tale, with the Autograph of the Author bitten
on the Pewter. Price 5s.

of “The Great Slipper Hunt.” Price 5s.

of Introduction to the New One. Price 5s.

sant sensation. The mumber, too, which an omnibus
will take, seems to be unlimited. Every passenger
is entitled to a baby gratis. The fare is properly
sixpence, and a little one in. The thirteen insides
are by this footing made to stand for six-and-twenty.

a fortune.

THE PENNY-A-MILERs.
THE cheap Omnibus system, it seems, has long
been common in Scotland. We always gave the
Scotch credit for making a penny go further than
anybody else.
A RNow ING TRICR.
WE recommend that the custom of wearing
hair-powder should be revived amongst young
men of wealth and aristocratic connexions, holding
high rank in the army and navy. This fashion
might be advantageously re-introduced, with a
view to obviate invidious comparisons; so many
of their inferior officers having grown grey in their
respective services.
The Dancer and the Pope.
FANNY Elsie R has been allowed to kiss the
Pope's toe. The Poet BUNN immediately sent of
proposals to the lady, who, it is pretty certain, will
appear shortly after Christmas at Drury Lane.
She will dance a new historical passeul to be called
the Pas de Pape.
More Explosions.
THERE has been discovered a kind of explosive
paper. The BERRELEY Brothers, in the letters
they have lately written to one another, have cer-
tainly availed themselves of this discovery.
Duly Qualified.
A country paper, very rudely commenting on
the Duchess of MARLBorough's late shooting feat
on the Duke's manors, asks—“What was her certifi-
cate?” And the Duchess makes answer and says–
“A marriage certificate.”

THE ENGLISH IN LITTLE.
BY GENERAL TOM THUMB.
TOM THUMB GOES TO THE PALACE–THE * BACKSTAIRS’"–THE
MAIDS-OF-HONOUR.
Don't much like going to the Palace up the back-
stairs,” said Governor BARNUM. “Shouldn't much
like Congress to know it. 'Tisn't doing the thing by
the star-spangled banner. However, just to see what
crowned heads is made of, we'll go.”
“In course,” said I, for already I felt my teeth in
the royal muffins. “In course.”
- BARNUM set down, and writ a short note to the
QUEEN, civilly telling her, that as we had no other
engagement for that night, we'd come. BARNUM
was going to seal the letter with wax.
“Governor,” says I, “no wax : think of the inde-
pendence of the model republic, and seal with a
wafer.”
Well, at seven o'clock, for the QUEEN dimed very
early that day to see us, we druv from our private
lodgings in Grafton Street to Buckingham Palace.
We took nothing more than a cab, to show American
independence.
ſ: “If Mas. Victoria,” said BARNUM to me, “had
/* asked us in at the front-gate, where the flag is flying,
I we'd have gone, General, in a coach-and-six. As it
is, we'll match the back-stairs with a cab.”
Well, we druv up, and hadn't need to ring the
º bell; for the door was opened in a minute, and a
º dozen critturs in crimson—with railroads of gold
*…* running up and down their coats, and their heads as
if they'd come out of a snow-storm, were waitin for
us. I hadn't then time to make a meditation ; or I should have said
something about happy Columbia, where our helps are free citizens,
and not tattooed by the tailors, as they are among the Britishers.
However, I did say to Governon BARNUM very softly, “I’d rather be a
Red Man than a Man in Crimson.” Whereupon, the Governor half-
shut his eye, like a slit in a money-box, and held up his finger.
“General, this is the back-stairs,” said one of the helps in crimson.
P'raps, my countrymen—for I write to Americans—you may have
heard of the back-stairs of palaces. You never saw sich a thing, and
for the sake of our happy republic I hope you never will. At Wash-
ington there is no back-stairs. When we want MR. Polk, we don't
stand knocking at the door ; but just turn the handle and walk into
the drawing-room ; and, if he's not there, into any other place in the
house; and we should just like to catch him putting a bolt to any
door on the premises. 'Tis n’t so at the court of the Britishers.
“This is the back stairs,” said the help. And first, to begin with,
they are so tarnation small, and so cruel crooked, that I'm certain no
really great man ever could go up and down 'em. Howsomever, the
| Governor and I mounted and mounted—feeling ourselves walking up
a corkscrew—and we both thought there would be no end to it.
How
I did pity the poor critturs of palaces, obligated to run up and down
a twisting, twirling, back staircase, fitterer for eels and snakes to go
up and down, and in and out—much fitterer than for two-legged
humans.
Well, at last we got up the back-stairs, and though I am lovely
small, when I’d got to the end I never did feel so little in my life.
“Governor,” says I, “if they don't let us out at the front gate, I shall
stay here for good. There is no back-stairs in a Free Republic, and
my dander is up at the thoughts on it.”
Agin the Governor puts up his finger, as much as to say “bus'ness.”
So I says nothin, but stands still to get my wind. “You must stay
here till HER MAJESTY shall be pleased to command your presence,”
said the help.
I was a little riled at this, but with “bus'ness” uppermost in my
mind, I said nothing. Well, in a few minutes, what they call a Lord-
in-waitin comes to us, and says we must follow him. You should
have seen the crittur. He was dressed in a sky-blue satin coat, with
amber-coloured very-smalls and a pink-waistcoat, with silver periwinkles
crawling all about it. There was bunches of silk sunflowers and
hollyhocks worked in his skirts—and silk convolvuluses a running
round his cuffs. He wanted nothing but a tight-rope and a balance-
pole to be set up for life.
And I dare say, now, you want to know what is meant by a Lord-
in-waitin. Why, it's jist a lord a waiting for whatever he can get to
better himself. They all belong to what is called, noble families, and
go to the palace to learn to be humble to their own helps at home.
And you may be sure they are. For when a lord stands upon his
two legs for hours behind the QUEEN-and carries PRINCE ALBERT's
fowling-piece when he goes a gunning—and holds his horse for him to
get up and down agin—and brings him his hat, and gloves, and stick,
and all that—why, you may be sure that sich a lord has all the starch
taken out of him by the time he gets back to his own house. It's only
nat 'ral.
Well, this Lord-in-waitin took us through one room and then through
another and another—and if I wasn't reminded of them boxes, that
go on holding a box inside a box, until there's no end on 'em,--I'm a
'possum, that's all.—At last, he said, “You’ll stay here.” I began to
rile agin—but agin the Governor held up his finger.
By-am-by comes a whole cloud of Maids-of-honour. Oh, such
walking nosegays of lilies and roses : I felt my heart bein’ cut up
like an apple—and a slice being served out all round.
Well, if I didn't think they’d eat me! Yes; I'm a sea-sarpent, if
I didn't think my time was come ; for they all run at me—with their
arms out—like a flock of fowls at corn. “I’ll kiss him,” says one—
“No, me first,” says another—“Don’t you think it,” said a third—
“I’ll kiss him, if I die for it,” screeched a fourth ; and so they pulled
me from one to another—and kissed, and kissed, and kissed—you woud
have thought there was a thousand cart-whips a smacking altogether.
I have been a good deal about the world; and have been kissed by
the ladies in all quarters. It is therefore my intention to write you a
geographical account of kissing; beginning with our own dear Yankee
Doodle girls, and ending with the Britishers. But to do this—and
while QUEEN VICTORIA is a waitin to receive me — I must take
another sheet of paper.
JOHN BULL’S TWO DIFFICULTIES.
OH ! my name it is John BULL, with my waistcoat all so full,
And my pockets all so heavy with the rhino ;
With my cattle and my crops, and my merchandise and shops,
I am better off than any man that I know.
Yes ; I’m better off than any man that I know,
Much better off than any man that I know ;
Though I say it, that should not, such possessions I have got,
That I’m better off than any man that I know.
I have warehouses and docks, I have bridges, I have locks,
Quite unrivall'd in their plan and execution;
And I build the very best of private dwellings, 'tis confest,
But I cannot build a public institution.
No ; I fail at a public institution,
Always stick at a public institution ;
My invention is so dull, that I always make a mull,
When I build any public institution.
If with me you fain would try, Oh ye foreigners to vie
At a tunnel or a steam-engine—have at you !
To construct a man-of-war I’m the best of hands, by far,
But hang me if I can make a statue !
No, drat it ! I can't make a statue !
Confound it ! I can't make a statue !
Though I try with all my might, I can never do it right—
Botheration I I can't make a statue !

Clerical Disqualification Extraordinary.
It is stated by a correspondent of the Times, that the Bishop of
LoNDoN has refused to receive a clergyman into his diocese, on the
ground of his being an Irish clergyman. The prejudice against poor
Paddy seems to be increasing. Perhaps we shall have the bishop
advertising for a curate, after the manner of a publican in want of a
pot-boy, with the notification—“No Irish need apply.”
MORE PLAGUE THAN PROPHET.
THE Leeds Times informs us that DR. Wolff insisted, in all his
preachings in 1832, that the world would be at an end in fifteen years.
If this prediction is true, next year will sée us all out. We need not
say that we hope this “cry of Wolff,” is as fallacious as its fabulous
prototype.
THE “LIGHT OF ALL NATIONS.”
THE little that was lately seen of the Sun has entirely disappeared
within the last few days. An alarming rumour prevails that he has
been totally “used up" by the Daguerreotypes.

“Your Bath is quite READY, MA’AM.”
“Well, but My Good GIRL, I can’t GET INto such A Bit of A thing As That
A BAD PRECEDENT.
PERHAPs the only solid objection to the remo-
val of the Statue of the DUKE of WELLINGTox
from the top of the arch, is the handle it affords
to other statues to insist on being removed
from their present unfavourable positions. We
understand that NELsoN has already begun to
betray considerable uneasiness at the top of
his column, and a strong movement may possi-
bly be made by his friends to get the same justice
dealt out to the Hero of the Nile which is about
to be accorded to the Victor at Waterloo. It may
be said that NElson has been guilty of laches in
not being down upon the public long ago, if he
had really, objected to the post—or pillar—as-
signed to him. It must, however, be remem-
bered that poor NELsoN has been literally tied
by the leg, as any one will be able to ascertain,
by the tremendous coil of rope that twines itself
gracefully—or rather, disgracefully—round the
calves of the naval conqueror. So disgusted has
he been with the misery of his position, that had
they allowed him sufficient rope there is not the
smallest doubt in the world that he would long
ago have hanged himself. There are several
other statues whose cases call for commiseration,
and we think equal justice ought to be dealt
out to all, but particularly to that glorious tar
who, in the nautical language of the Com-
mander of the Buttercup, may be said “to have
reached the very highest binnacle.”

EFFECTS OF SERVING A LORD IMAYOR.
WE have received the following extraordinary letter, which requires
no comment, or which, if it did, would not get any from us at the pre-
sent moment:—
“Sir, I have to complain of the injury that has been done me by
the excessive hospitality of the late Lord MAYoF Johnson. I entered
his service quite a genteel figure, and indeed, having been employed
by LoRD MAYor MAGNAY, had been reduced almost to the dimensions
of a skeleton; I had since that got myself into what Icall good condition,
without any sacrifice of my figure, but a year in the service of LoRD
MAYOR Johnson has completely ruined my symmetry, laid waste my
waist, and carved out mycalves for a regular GUY in the most distressing

manner. The constant festivities at the Mansion House may have
been sport to the guests, but it has been death to my pretensions to
elegance of contour, which was always worth an additional four pounds
to my wages. I want to know, Sir, whether I have any remedy for the
injury that has been done to me in my profession. I forward two por-
traits, one representing me as I was before entering LoRD Johnson's
service, and the other showing what he has reduced—or rather what
he has enlarged—me to. As HAMLET says, “Look on this picture”
—but not on this. Believe me, yours to the fullest extent,

for eggs—for eggs of all kinds, whether of barn-door poultry, or the
more exotic laying of cockatrice. We have seen the egg hornpipe
performed by a young lady at a country fair ; and pleasing it was to
behold the grace with which the blindfolded damsel would wind in and
out of the ovary circle, now essaying the rocking-step, and now the
double-shuffle.
The egg hornpipe, as performed a few days since at Exeter
Hall, by MR. Stowell, for the benefit of the Protestant Association,
was no less dexterous—the rocking-step and the double-shuffle alike
complete.
“He would rather see that man in power who boldly said he would endow the Roman
Catholics, than the man who, under the cover of Christianity, nursed in his bosom the
cockatrice egg, which, when hatched, brought forth the Maynooth Grant.”
Nursing a cockatrice egg under cover of Christianity, which brought
forth the Maynooth Grant, in effect means this: to bring forth Roman
Catholic poultry—nothing less than the cock of St. PETER. But the
Rev. orator has not done with the egg.
“It was the misfortune of the Protestants that their efforts had generally been too
late; their proper time for exertion was when Parliament was in the egg.”
That is, before it began to cackle. It would be well for MR.
Stow ELL were he, by the like cause, compelled to the like silence.
* Bresson is Coming.”
It is said that LADY LYTTLETON, the governess, uses these words to
the royal children to quiet them when naughty; and with reason, for
says Le Commerce:
“M. BREsson has already signified to the Ministry that, in quitting Madrid, he would
expect the embassy at London,”
and—it is understood by LoRD BRough AM and others in the con-
fidence of Louis-PhILIPPE—will be the bearer of a love-letter (with
portrait) of the CoMTE DE PARIs to the little Princess Royal. New
locks and bolts have been ordered by the QUEEN for the nursery.

THE SNOBS OF ENGLAND.
BY ONE OF THEMSELVES,
CHAPTER xxxWIII.-A VISIT TO SOME COUNTRY SNOBS.
HY, dear MR. SNoB,” said a young lady of rank
and fashion (to whom I present my best compli-
ments), “if you found everything so snobbish at
the Evergreens, if the pig bored you and the
mutton was not to your liking, and MRs. Ponto
was a humbug, and Miss WIRT a nuisance, with
her abominable piano practice,—why did you
stay so long f"
Ah Miss, what a question I Have you never
heard of gallant British soldiers storming bat-
teries, of doctors passing mights in plague wards
of lazarettos, and other instances of martyrdom ?
What do you suppose induced gentlemen to walk
two miles up to the batteries of Sobraon, with a
hundred and fifty thundering guns bowling them
down by hundreds 2—not pleasure, surely.
| What causes your respected father to quit his comfortable home for
| his chambers, after dinner, and pore over the most dreary law papers
until long past midnight Duty, Mademoiselle; duty, which must
be done alike by military, or legal, or literary gents. There's a
power of martyrdom in our profession. Ask Snº Edward GeoRGE
EARL LYTToN BULWER LYTToN if there isn't, or any other eminent
hand.
You won't believe it 2 Your rosy lips assume a smile of incre-
dulity—a most naughty and odious expression in a young lady's face.
Well then, the fact is, that my chambers, No. 24, Pump Court,
Temple, were being painted by the Honourable Society, and MRs.
SLAMKIN, my laundress, having occasion to go into Durham to see her
daughter, who is married, and has presented her with the sweetest
little grandson—a few weeks could not be better spent than in rusti-
cating. But ah, how delightful Pump Court looked when I revisited
its well-known chimney-pots 1 Cari luogi. Welcome, welcome, O fog
and smut !
But if you think there is no moral in the foregoing account of the
Pontine family, you are, Madam, most painfully mistaken. In this
very chapter we are going to have the moral—why, the whole of the
papers are nothing but the moral, setting forth as they do the folly of
being a Snob.
You will remark that in the Country Snobography my poor friend
Ponto has been held up almost exclusively for the public gaze—and
why? Because we went to no other house ? e other families
did not welcome us to their mahogany ? No, no. SIR John HAw-
Buck of the Haws, SIR John HIPslEY of Briary Hall, don't shut the
gates of hospitality; of GENERAL SAGo's Mulligatawny I could speak
from experience. And the two old ladies at Guttlebury, were they
nothing P Do you suppose that an agreeable young dog who shall be
nameless, would not be made welcome * Don't you know that people
are too glad to see anybody in the country?
But those dignified personages do not enter into the scheme of the
present work, and are but minor characters of our Snob drama; just
as, in the play, kings and emperors are not half so important as many
humble persons. The Doge of Venice, for instance, gives way to Othello,
who is but a nigger, and the King of France to Falconbridge, who is a
gentleman of positively no birth at all. So with the exalted characters
above mentioned. I perfectly well recollect that the claret at HAw-
Buck's was not by any means so good as that of HIPSLEY's, while, on
the contrary, some white hermitage at the Haws (by the way, the
butler only gave me half a glass each time) was supernacular. And
I remember the conversations. Oh, Madam, Madam, how stupid they
were ! The sub-soil ploughing; the pheasants and poaching; the
row about the representation of the county; the EARL of MANGEL-
wurzELSHIRE being at variance with his relative and nominee, the
HoNourABLE MARMADUKE ToMNoDDY ; all these I could put down,
had I a mind to violate the confidence of private life ; and a great
deal of conversation about the weather, the Mangelwurzelshire Hunt,
new manures, and eating and drinking, of course.
But cui bono 2 In these perfectly stupid and honourable families
there is not that Snobbishness which it is our purpose to expose. An
ox is an ox—a great, hulking, fat-sided, bellowing, munching Beef.
He ruminates according to his nature, and consumes his destined
portion of turnips or oilcake, until the time comes for his disappearance
from the pastures, to be succeeded by other deep-lunged and fat-ribbed
animals. Perhaps we do not respect an ox. We rather acquiesce in
him. The Snob, my dear Madam, is the Frog that tries to swell him-
self to ox size. Let us pelt the silly brute out of his folly.
Look, I pray you, at the case of my unfortunate friend Ponto, a
good-natured, kindly English gentleman—not over-wise, but quite
passable—fond of port-wine, of his family, of country sports and
agriculture, hospitably minded, with as pretty a little patrimonial
country house as heart can desire, and a thousand pounds a-year.
It is not much ; but entre nous, people can live for less, and not un-
comfortably.
For instance, there is the Doctor, whom MRs. P. does not conde-
scend to visit : that man educates a mirific family, and is loved by
the poor for miles round ; and gives them port-wine for physic and
medicine, gratis. And how those people can get on with their pittance,
as MRs. Ponto says, is a wonder to her.
Again, there is the Clergyman, Doctor CHRYsosroM,-MRs. P.
says they quarrelled about Puseyism, but I am given to understand it
was because MRs. C. had the pas of her at the Haws—you may see
what the value of his living is any day in the Clerical Guide; but you
don't know what he gives away.
Even PETriPois allows that, in whose eyes the Poctor's surplice is
a scarlet abomination ; and so does PETTIPOIs do his duty in his way,
and administer not only his tracts and his talk, but his money and his
means to his people. As a lord's son, by the way, MRs. Ponto is
uncommonly anxious that he should marry either of the girls whom
LoRD GULEs does not intend to choose.
Well, although Fox's income would make up almost as much as
that of these three worthies put together—O my dear Madam, see in
what hopeless penury the poor fellow lives | What tenant can look
to his forbearance 2 What poor man can hope for his charity ?
“Master's the best of men,” honest STRIPEs says, “and when we was
in the ridgment, a more free-handed chap didn't live. But the way in
which Missus du scryou, Iwonder the young ladies is alive, that I du.”
They live upon a fine governess and fine masters, and have clothes
made by LADY CARABAs's own milliner; and their brother rides with
earls to cover; and only the best people in the county visit at the
Evergreens, and MRs. Ponto thinks herself a paragon of wives and
mothers, and a wonder of the world, for doing all this misery and
humbug, and snobbishness, on a thousand a-year.
What an inexpressible comfort it was, my dear Madam, when
STRIPEs put my portmanteau in the four-wheeled chaise, and (poor
PoN. being touched with sciatica) drove me over to the Carabas
Arms at Guttlebury, where we took leave. There were some bagmen
there, in the Commercial Room, and one talked about the house he
represented ; and another about his dinner, and a third about the
Inns on the road, and so forth—a talk, not very wise, but honest and
to the purpose—about as good as that of the country gentlemen ; and
Oh, how much pleasanter than listening to Miss WIRT's show-
pieces on the piano, and MRs. Ponto's genteel cackle about the
fashion and the county families
PUMPKIN AT THE PALACE.
A FEw days since, MR. WILMot of Isleworth sent a pumpkin to
Windsor Castle—a pumpkin six feet ten inches in circumference,
and weighing 148lbs. The Queen, the Prince, and the Royal Children,
having duly inspected it, MR. BRADwell was sent for from the
Colosseum, and on his arrival at the Castle, immediately—(as of
old at Covent Garden)—changed the pumpkin into a Cinderella's
carriage for the Princess Royal. It is expected that the House of
Commons will supply the required number of rats which, duly trans-
formed into ponies, will complete the equipage.
Amusements of the Metropolis.
THE engagement of the Statue concludes at Christmas. It will then
start on a grand tour through the metropolis, and go through its
celebrated range of attitudes, introducing some new “Poses Gro-
tesques.” There is a rumour that it is engaged at Astley's, to appear
in a grand new Equestrian Christmas Pantomime, to be called “The
Statues of London.”
“ UNE NOIRCEUR DE L'ANGLETERRE.”
THERE have been several dreadful fogs at Paris lately. The National
declares they are only another penetrating proof of the system of
Perſide Albion. “England cannot invade France, (it says) so it does
everything it can to blacken it.”

In the centre of London, at the busy cross of Charing, thefstranger
may have observed a stone pedestal lone and deserted in the midst of
| the surrounding noise and bustle, like the last rose of summer, or
rather like the last holly-berry of winter left pining alone, when
Spring has begun to play the part of a gratuitous Moses, and clothe
everything in leaves and flowers.
| There is a little romance attached to that vacant pedestal. Some
say it is haunted by the perturbed spirit of SIR CHRistopher WREN
who loves to lament over the spoiling of the finest site in Europe, and
will never allow any object to rest in peace upon that vacant pedestal.
If this is mere superstition, it should at once be discouraged by a
notice that the pedestal is to let, with immediate possession. If the
idea of its being haunted takes too firm hold of the people, it will be
vain to endeavour to get rid of the feeling of aversion with which the
spot will be regarded.
There are many houses in different parts of London for which no
| tenant can be found, in consequence of a rumour that they are subject
to ghostly visits. If it has the reputation of being spectre-struck, it
may as well be in Chancery—a fate from which no messuage was ever
known to recover in less than three generations. It would be worth
while to give place to some bold piece of statuary, if only to redeem
the character of the pedestal
t-
A Bºumane Government.
It gives us exceeding pleasure to copy the following from the Daily
News :-
“Seats are now being placed, similar to those in the parks, for the use of the public,
beneath a handsome row of trees, on the foot pavement in Piccadilly.”
The real purpose of this benevolence has modestly been withheld by
the Government, but it is this :-the authorities having observed the
terrible effect of the Wellington Statue on the people passing eastward,
have caused the seats to be erected that they may rest and a little |
recover themselves from the shock to their good taste. This is humane,
at least.
|
|
|
A PRETTY TURN-OUT.
WE have seen a paragraph in the papers announcing that a School-
master has been expelled from Cannes on account of his being a Pro- |
testant. LoRD BRough AM, who is the only “Schoolmaster abroad” in
that part of the world, has not been expelled from Cannes; at least if
he has, the fact is not alluded to in our correspondence.
A DREADFUL PASS.
| ONE of the three papers which praise the Wellington Statue calls it
a startling work of art.” We agree with our contemporary—it cer-
nly has that effect on the horses that pass it.
COMFORT OF WIFE AND CHILDREN.
When a Magistrate's indignation begins crescendo, it is certain to end
diminuendo. Many are the instances of this judicial vocalization. The
LoRD MAYor sings small in the like manner. Two days after CAR-
Roll's coronation as King of the City, one WILLIAM BURN, waggoner,
was charged with cruelly beating a horse about the head with the butt-
end of a whip.
“The Lond MAvon expressed great indignation at the conduct of the defendant, and
was about to fine him to the utmost extent, when he suddenly learned that the fellow had
a very large family, and that the infliction would inevitably fall upon the heads of his
| wife and children.
“The Lond MAvon (to the defendant): You deserve the weightiest punishment, but
I cannot think of punishing your wife and children. The sentence of the court upon
| you is, that you pay a fine of 10s., or be confined in the House of Correction for 14 days-
“The defendant thanked his lordship and paid the fine.”
Now there is generally this additional evil about all ill-doing, that it
is rare indeed, for the culprit to suffer alone : the innocent, directly or
indirectly, suffer with him. It is with all tenderness we feel disposed
to comment on his lordship's sentence; but how are culprits to be
punished without punishing their wives and children? Are prisoners
to be allowed to plead their conjugal and paternal responsibilities in
commutation of sentence 7 Are only the single and the childless to
be punished in full When the convict ship drops down the river for
Norfolk Island,-how many innocent wives and children does she leave
participating in the punishment of the exiled ”
The LoRD MAYor to carry out his principle, ought not to have fined
WILLIAM BURN a single farthing, seeing that any fine must be deducted
from the meat and bread of his wife and family. “I must take care of
my family,” says the scoundrel Silky in the play, in excuse for all his
rascalities. For our part, we think “wife and family” ought to impress
men with a more serious conviction of their social responsibilities; and
not be rendered, by magisterial weakness, the excuse and stalking-horse
for violence and brutality.

“DEAR DEAR 1 DEAR! how very provoking ! HERE's one END of the
Barrel come out, AND All the oysters Mixed with My clean collans!"
Sending the Hat Round.
WE understand that the Eton Montem has been discontinued this
year in consequence of the Mendicity Society having giving notice to
the principals of the college that they should be compelled to take all
boys into custody they found begging on the public highway.
STOW IT, STOWELL.
| A MR. Stowell has been holding forth at Exeter Hall on the subject
of Popery. We are requested to state that this would-be teacher of the
people is not Stowell the Informer. We believe it is “quite the
reverse.”

{IIuminations on the 33rince of &laſtg's 33ittſjöap.
If loyalty and illuminations go together, we regret to say there was
very little of the former quality exhibited on the occasion of the PRINCE
of WALEs's birthday. We do not, however, believe that the con-
sumption of gas or the burning of oil is necessary to evince the attach-
ment of the English people to the members of the Royal Family.
The gas, though it certainly flows from the heart of the City, does not
come from the hearts of the citizens. We therefore see nothing un-
complimentary in the meagreness of the illuminations on the PRINCE
of WALEs's birthday. It is true that MessRs. TUOKER, the tallow-
chandlers, of Kensington, flare up with loyalty on every possible
occasion, and startle the suburb by a solitary illumination, of which no
one can divine the cause; but it must be remembered that they can
be loyal at a very cheap rate, as they manufacture all the materials on
their own premises. Hence we see an occasional M, or an S, or L,
every now and then exhibited, which appears like a mysterious cipher,
until some one, learned in the lore of royal nativities, ascertains that
the initial indicates the birthday of a Mecklenburgh, a Strelitz, or a
Leuchtenberg connection of the reigning family.
The illuminations on the birthday of the
PRINCE of WALEs were not very brilliant, but
they were somewhat general. Among the
principal we noticed the clock at the office of
the Morning Chronicle, which, by a peculiarity
in the falling of the shadows on the face, makes
it appear to be always five minutes to seven.
We regret to be obliged to censure the curds-
and-whey authorities at Hyde Park Corner, who
left their dial in the customary state of dark-
ness that has lately come over it. We under-
stand that its face has never been illumed by
brightness since the Wellington Statue came to
throw a shade over its once bright and cheerful aspect.
Perhaps the most brilliant
among the illuminations of the
º
º º
º
º
evening were those of the
medical men and chemists, who
displayed transparencies of
surpassing richness and variety. --
The depth of colour came home —
to the eye of every artist, and -=
dyed the pavement with green -
or red for a considerable -

perhaps the most interesting __e=
objects would be the perambu-
lating illuminations presented
by the police, who went their rounds on
the Prince's birthday with a brilliant
light, obtained by the disposition of the
official bull's-eye in a novel and striking
manner.
Even this happy device was, however,
eclipsed by an arrangement adopted by
the proprietors of some of the vegetable
stalls in Clare and other markets. A
turnip being scooped out, a candle was
cleverly inserted in the aperture, and one
of these having been caught up by a
passing boy, and mischievously hurled
to some distance, had all the effect of an
illuminated missile.
The most general illumination was
that of the old street lamp, which, in
many instances, seemed to assume the

most interesting features, in compliment -
to the Prince whose birthday it was de-E
signed to celebrate.
NEW OMNIBUS ESCAPE.
.
n
AMID the numerous escapes that ingenuity is always suggesting to
get the public out of any of the dilemmas to which it is liable, there is
not, that we are aware of, any escape from an omnibus blockade in
Fleet Street. We think that every vehicle ought to be compelled to
carry something of the sort, for the convenience of passengers, who are
often hemmed in for hours together, as firmly as if they were stuck fast
in an endeavour to force some impossible passage into some inaccessible
quarter of some unknown world. In order to admit of easy extrication
from this horrible situation, a plan might easily be adopted by which a
sort of elastic ladder would, on the touching of a spring, rise from the
top of the omnibus to the second floor windows of the houses on either
side of a street, and thus afford an easy rescue from a perilous position.
“WHAT IS SAUCE FOR THE GOOSE,” &c.
THE Bishop of LoNDoN in his last charge, is very severe upon those
persons who can afford to build churches and do not. He hurls at
them a quotation from HoRACE :—
Ergo
Quod superat, non est meliùs quo insumere possis?
Cur eget indignus quisquam, te divite 2 Quare
Templa ruunt antiqua Deûm 2 . Cur, improbe, carae
Non aliquid patriae tanto emetiris acervo Ž
We submit a free translation of the above for his lordship's consider-
ation.—
The rents which from thy diocese arise,
Would buy three German principalities.
Hast thou no surplus then the hearths to cheer
Of curates, starved on eighty pounds a year 7
WREN’s work in ruins crumbling camst thou see
A prey to rain, wind, GIBBs, and Chancery 7
And count thy coppers as the showman bawls,
“Sixpence the Abbey, tuppence for St. Pauls?"
Search London's diocese and ask, with shame,
What church or chapel bears its Bishop's name *
St. Stephen's, Walbrook.
==
A JUDICIOUS MEASURE.
We understand it is in contemplation by the Directors of the Eastern
Counties Railway to engage musical conductors for their express trains,
as it is hoped by this arrangement the locomotives may be made to
Chemical substitution.
WoRDERFUL effects sometimes flow from very slight causes, and the
origin of gun cotton is perhaps as curious as the origin of gunpowder.
PROFEssoR SchöNBEIN was always remarkable for his fear of being
drawn for the militia. He was often heard to exclaim, during the
keep their time.
CURIOUS EXPERIMENT.
WE believe an experiment was lately made at the Red House, Batter-
F. of ballotting, “Qh dear met how I do abominate gunpowder. sea, by an intelligent City draper, of firing cotton balls; we have great
wish I could find a substitute.” His head thus became full of those pleasure in adding that it was perfectly successful, the inventor assuring
two objects—gunpowder and substitutes—until he at last found a us, at the same time, that from his long practice at the rifle he would

husband up in the papers, is Louis-NApoleoN.
THEIDUCAL
POULTERER.
THE DUKE of MARLBoRough certainly ought to get a living, for he
is a most industrious member of the aristocracy. As a showman he
evinced great enterprise by the exhibition of Blenheim, which netted,
and we believe still nets, a very considerable revenue. The Duke has,
however, hit upon an expedient for coining money which involves his
own personal exertion, and thus makes labour a source of profit. He
has taken to the shooting and selling of game, and not only bags the
| birds but bags the money. If a carriage loaded with game, and bearing
a ducal coronet, should roll into Leadenhall Market, we may presume
that the vehicle belongs to the DUKE of MARLBorough. We should
recommend the words “Licensed to deal in Game” as an appropriate
addition to the family motto.
THE MISERY OF WEALTH.
We shall not attempt to fathom the why and the
wherefore ; but certain it is, the world always
exhibits great tenderness, much anxiety, for rich
and unprotected heiresses. It will be continually
marrying them to somebody. There is Miss
BURDETT Coutts — poor golden virgin l—the
world insists upon her becoming a wife ; will not
allow her to pass on,
“In maiden meditation, fancy free;”
but resolves to give her into the custody of a
husband. MR. DUNN–with all the brass of Tri-
nity College—tried to carry the fair millionaire
by Irish storm: that did not succeed ; where-
upon the world set to work, match-making, deter-
mined to unite the splendid heiress to somebody.
Now, she was to marry her physician; and now,
she was to become a Scotch countess. The last
How Miss CouTTs
escaped IBRAHIM PAchA when he was here, is somewhat extraordinary.
For if the Emperor of China were to vouchsafe to let fall his shadow
upon the British Court, in the shape of an Ambassador, it would very
soon appear in the papers that “His Excellency ChiNG-Chow-CHERRY-
Chow—having cut his pig-tail and conformed to the Christian religion
—was about to lead Miss BURDETT CouTTs to the Hymeneal altar;”
And the cause of all this persecution, is—wealth. The root of all evil,
with poor Miss CouTTs, produces this daily crop of annoyance. Now,
Punch, being the sworn champion of all distressed maidens, advises
Miss CouTTs to lay out every penny of her wealth—save some three or
four hundred a-year—upon churches, sharing the everlasting presenta-
tions among the Bench of Bishops. This done, she may be assured of
it, the papers will suffer her to enjoy unmolested celibacy for the rest
of her life. Clearly, her only way to escape the hunters of the press,
is to throw away all her money.
QFFICIAL, ArrorNTMENT.-SIR FREDERICR TRENch to be Groom in
waiting to the Wellington Statue.
| THE WHOLE DUTY OF AN AMBASSADOR.
(From the Day-Book of Louis-Philippe.)
HE principal duty of an ambassador is to contract
marriages. To take away a princess from the am-
| 2:= bassador of another country is the highest stroke
Jºž of diplomacy; to wheedle a royal mother and
cajole an entire ministry are sublime proofs of
genius which can only be sufficiently repaid with
º titles and crosses. An ambassador should under-
XXº stand the whole art of courtship, and should always
3CH=º be provided with a stock of portraits (set in dia-
-- monds), and a list of virtues (beautifully coloured)
of all the young unmarried princes of his courte.
He should possess a tongue well trained to flattery, and not allow the
truth to stand in the way of a compliment. Small talk must be
his great accomplishment, and the marriage service his constant
| study. He should only have one end in view, and that must be the
| church door. The circle of his duties is contained in a wedding-ring.
Appropriate Reward.
WE learn from The Builder that the daughters of GENERAL SIMcoe
have for ever put to shame the workers in Berlin wool, and the artists
of canary birds on white satin : for they—on the ruins of the old abbey
of Dunkswell, near Honiton,-" have erected a church, for which they
worked all the stone with their own hands.” Now young ladies who can
build a church, ought to be rewarded by the very best husbands in-
stantly prepared for the altar.

But then, BARNUM says, I
was nobody; and gals don't
Riss nobodies like somebodies. For all that, I’m a little riled when I think of it. For I
remember, how at New York they used to look at me, and mince round and round me, and
put their hands under my chin, as if I warn’t a human cretur, but a gooseberry bush, and
they were afraid of their fingers. And then the boldest on 'em kissed me short and not at
all satisfactory; for all the world as if they thought they was doing me a service, and not
themselves an honour. They'll find me rayther different when I get back, I calculate; so
they’d better practise a little afore I come among 'em.
Now in England kissing is mighty hearty. The gals arn’t a bit ashamed on it. I shall
say no more here about the Maids-of-Honour as kissed me a million times in the Palace, but
speak of the 'Gyptian Hall, where I was kissed four thousand times a day, which is only
allowing eight kisses a piece for every female : some on 'em took more—some less, but
I’m striking the averages. I had when I was first shewed there, tarnation pretty dimples ;
and in a month, my cheeks was as smooth as an apple. The dimples was kissed out ;
run away with by the lips of the ladies. I often said to BARNUM, “Governor, this is by
no means the Cheshire. I feel my face is wasting away with so much kissing ; melting slick
like a sugar-plum in a baby's mouth. Tell you what it is ; if I'm to lose my cheeks, Iought
to make something by 'em. Therefore, its my opinion you should alter the price, in this
way. “Them as only looks, a shilling; them as kisses, eighteenpence.” Once or twice—for
to be kissed eight different ways by five hundred females is nation hard work—once or
twice, I thought I'd have a notice writ, and hung about my neck; sich a one as I seed at
a flower-show, with these words—“Admire, but touch not.” I confess it : now and then
I used to be riled; used to say to myself, “Have you nobody at home to kiss ; that you
will put on your bonnets and pattens to come and kiss a little gentleman in public 7" But
as I said afore ; take the people altogether, English kissing is mighty pleasant.
In Scotland I was only kissed outright at private parties. Of that, as a man of honour, I
say nothing. In public, the ladies used to blow kisses at me through their fingers.
Was kissed tarnation in France. Rayther disagreeable in one particular, as the ladies so
very often left the paint upon my nose.
Talking of France, it’s a wonder I’m a single man. For when the King of the French
heard from BARNUM that I had got the fortin I have, I’m darned if he didn't say he
must have me for one of the Princesses. Now, being a true republican, that didn't suit
my book at all. “No, no,” says I to BARNUM ; “don’t mind the Princesses kissing me
now and then, when I'm in a good temper, but I'd as soon run upon a snag as upon the
marriage service. Seen too much of life, and been kissed a little too much round the
world for that.” So I escaped—cut slick from the Tuileries—going off in BARNUM's
hat-box.
Well, I did think that I should give a whole account of all the kissing I’ve gone through,
but on second thoughts it can't be done here, no how. The subject is so full—as BARNUM
says—that I can't do it justice in a little book, so I intend to make it a big history, by
itself, with picturs of the ladies, with their lips made up jest as they attacked me ;
made up now peaking like rose-buds, and now as if I was a cake at a pastry-cook's, made
for nothing but to be eaten. It’s wonderful to a man with my experience of lips to know
alty of Europe will be
what mouths can be made on 'em. Nobody
would believe it, but they will when they see
Tor1A's palace.
When the Maids-of-Honour had done kissing

Maids-of-Honour fellback, andjL following the
lord, and—BARNUM following me—walks into
the presence of the Queen of the British Isles.
I'd made my mind up to show my independence,
to go in whistling “Yankee Doodle,” or “Star of
Columbia,” but somehow I found my voice had
departed—gone slick, and not even left its ghost
behind—and BARNUM, too, I shouldn’t ha' known
him ; he shook all over, and his face looked as

AND I can't TURN IT off again '"
+tults amb 33 egulationg for 33 ailmapá.
THE French Government has published a royal ordomnance, fixing
the regulations that are henceforward to be observed by all Railway
Companies in working their lines. As it is a pity these things should
be better managed in France, we publish a set of regulations for
English Railways. LoRD JoHN RUssell is welcome to them, if he likes.
I. Every passenger in the second and third class is to be allowed to
carry a dark lantern, or a penny candle, or a safety lamp, into the
train with him, as the Directors have kept the public in the dark quite
long enough.
II. No train is to travel slower than an omnibus, let the excursion
be ever so cheap, or the occasion ever so joyful.
III. No combustible material is to be carried on a passengers' train,
as the engine is risk enough for anybody.
IV. Cattle are to be separated from the passengers as much as pos-
sible, as it has been found, from experiments, that men and oxen do
not mix sociably together.
V. Every railway engine is to carry a large fender, to prevent the
cinders falling out of the fire; as, let the weather be ever so cold, poor
people do not like their coals being distributed to them hot.
VI. No stoppage at a railway station is to exceed half an hour.
VII. No Railway dividend is to exceed 100 per cent., and no bonus
to be divided oftener than once a month.
VIII. No fare is to be raised more than at the rate of a pound a
week.
IX. There must always be a sufficient supply of second and third
class carriages at every station, or else the passengers are to be allowed
seats in the first class without paying any additional fare.
X. No third class carriage is to contain more than a foot deep of
water in wet weather, but, to prevent accidents, corks and swimming-
belts, and a small engine, should always be kept in the open carriages.
XI. The ladies' carriages are to be waited upon by female policemen.
XII. Lectures and dramatic representations are to be given at the
stations to entertain the passengers when they are detained.
XIII. Payment of a shilling an hour is to be made to every poor man
for every hour he is detained on his journey over and above the ap-
pointed time.
XIV. Every tunnel must be illuminated with one candle at least.
XV. A magistrate is to be in attendance at every Station to grant
summonses against the Directors ; and all law expenses incurred are
to be paid by the Company.
XVI. Never less than five minutes are to be allowed for dinner or
refreshment.
XVII. One Director must always travel with every train, only he is
to be allowed the option of choosing his seat, either in the second or
third class—whichever of the two he prefers.
XVIII. Not more than fifty carriages are to be drawn with more
than one engine.
XIX. Hospitals are to be built at every terminus, and a surgeon to
be in attendance at every station.
XX. All the fines and damages levied upon a railway are to be paid
into a fund for building a series of almshouses, for the maintenance of
persons injured by accidents on railways,
XXI. There must be some communication between every carriage and
the stoker, or the guard, either by a bell, or a speaking tube, or a port-
giving information when their carriage is off the line, or falling over an
embankment, or a maniac or a horse has broken loose.
XXII. Railway clerks are to try to be civil ; at all events they must
make a struggle to answer questions that are put to them. Change
for a sovereign, also, must always be kept on the premises.
We must defer the publication of the proposed rules for luggage,
break of gauge, railway signals, sovereignty, &c., till our next number.
AN AMERICAN HOLYDAY.
A New York paper contains the particulars of a murder, which has
been recently committed by martial law. The victim of this atrocity
was an Irish seaman, named SAMUEL JAckson, who, after great provo-
cation, had knocked down his lieutenant. The poor man was delibe-
rately strangled at the yard-arm of the sloop St. Mary's, in the presence
of the squadron off Vera Cruz. An eye-witness of the diabolical act
states that—
“All labour in the different vessels was suspended for the day, and the crews were
directed to assume their holyday attire.”
We have heard of witches' Sabbaths; of days hallowed and sanctified
in the name of the fiend. Was not this a festival of that class 2

Spaniards to do at an auto da fe; with like observances did the Red
Indians slaughter their victims; and from them perhaps have their
conquerors adopted the practice. And thus were the priests of old

human sacrifices to MoLoch.

MAKING THE MOST OF
IT.
We understand that, with the view of making the most of the Grand
Ecclesiastical Exhibition Station, commonly called St. Paul's Cathedral,
the dome of that popular and attractive show is to be fitted up as a
camera obscura. We are only surprised that an arrangement affording
an opportunity for an extra charge of sixpence has not long-ago been
carried out by the authorities. Perhaps Daguerreotype likenesses
might also be taken in the ball, while the vast recesses of the roof
could be used as a sort of Pantechnicon, where property could be
received for warehousing, at the usual charges.
“THE RIGHT HON. JOHN JOHNSON, LATE LORD MAYOR.”
THE Common Council have advertised their acknowledgments of
the intelligence and large-hearted hospitality of ALDERMAN Johnson,
whilom Lord Mayor. Pity is it, that with such a man—
“A Mayor should shut, and be an Alderman again!”
It is as though a fine, lively turtle should dwindle and again enter its
original shell. But such is the fate of Mayors. Nevertheless, Johnson
has left a trail of light behind him. Johnson was the first Lord
Mayor who, in the words of the Council, extended his splendid hospita-
lity “to the variouslearned Societies associated for the promotion of the
arts, sciences and literature, which mark the present age.” He was the
first Mayor who formally introduced Art, Science, and Literature, to
Gog and Magog; and Punch has received a joint letter from those dis-
tinguished giants, assuring him that they shall think very shabbily of
any Mayor, present and to come, who does not keep up the new con-
nexion.
service of Danger.
“A GUARDswax,” writing in reply to “MILEs” in the Times, alludes
to the great mortality in the Guards, consequent on the hard and
constant duty which that corps has to perform. No doubt the London
campaign from May to August, is very trying to Guardsmen. Late
hours and want of rest must do sad injury to their constitutions.
They must suffer a great deal from the season. It is wonderful,
indeed, that more of them are not harassed to death by the fatigue-
duty of polkas and waltzes, and that they do not fall in even larger
numbers from the balls—though without powder—to which they
expose themselves.
REQUISITE RETURNS.
Among the Railway Bills that will be submitted to Parliament next
Session, it would be as well if there were all the surgeons' bills and
bills formanslaughter which have been occasioned by Railway negli-
gence.
The SPANTsh INTEREst.—We do not wish to quarrel with Spain on
account of the Montpessier marriage. Still, she ought to be made

CURIOSITIES OF JUSTICE.
WHEN a noble lord was hanged at Tyburn, the legend runs that,
standing by his order—vindicating his aristocracy to the last—he
would not be suffocated by vulgar hemp, but found his own halter of
silk : a consolation this, too profound for us to fathom. Possibly, how-
ever, the refined means of death took from the punishment something
of its ignominy. Moved by this hint, we would suggest that a treadmill
of superior material and workmanship should be erected in our prisons,
for the convenience of respectable offenders. They might walk up steps
of polished mahogany. Now, were this the case, one MR. Wilson—a
very respectable landlord, of the De Beauvoir Arms Tavern, Kingsland
—would, at this moment, enjoy the handsome engine, and not tread
vulgar deal in vulgar company. MR. BINGHAM—in an enthusiastic
moment of gin-drove his gig against an omnibus, perilling the lives of
two unfortunate companions. Police-Constable MILLHouse, quite
in an official way, placed his hand upon WILson, and was “almost
strangled” by the bacchanal for the attention. The case was heard at
Worship Street, when the magistrate—he said it was his custom
towards offenders “in affluent circumstances”—sentenced the offender
to the house of correction for seven days. The assault occurred in
Kingsland Road. Foolish Ms. Wilson 1 Why, why did you not
rather select Chandos Street, Covent Garden?
For Williant CARR-a brother Boniface, landlord of the Bunch of
Grapes, Newcastle Street—having, in vinous weakness or strength,
beaten an oil-and-colourman and a policeman of the F Division, was
fined by MR HALL, at Bow Stree, “five pounds for each assault.”
Thus the Justice of one court is not the Justice of another. Beat a
policeman in Covent Garden, and it is a purchaseableluxury, an enjoy-
ment to be had for five pounds; assault him in Kingsland Road, and
there is limbo, inevitable limbo. A small difference this, between a
five-pound note and the treadmill.
3titºffen gºeſobies.—Curry.
Three pounds of vealmy darling girl prepares,
And chops it micely into little squares;
Five onions next procures the little minx
(The biggest are the best, her SAMIwell thinks),
And Epping butter nearly half-a-pound,
And stews them in a pan until they’re brown'd.
What’s next my dexterous little girl will do?
She pops the meat into the savoury stew,
With curry-powder table-spoonfuls three,
And milk a pint, (the richest that may be)
And, when the dish has stewed for half-an-hour,
A lemon's ready juice she'll o'er it pour :
Then, bless her then she gives the luscious pot
A very gentle boil—and serves quite hot.
P.S.—Beef, mutton, rabbit, if you wish;
Lobsters, or prawns, or any kind of fish
Are fit to make A CURRY. "Tis, when done,
A dish for Emperors to feed upon.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR attention was attracted the other day by a rugged veteran
attired in a sort of Cockney gamekeeper's garb, whom we saw lounging
against one of the pillars of the Regent Street colonnade.
He carried a brisk little terrier under his arm. A litter of bull puppies
peered from the pockets of his shooting-jacket, and their mother, a sin-
fºly ill-favoured and bandy-legged female, cowered sullenly at his
eet.
Being curious to ascertain what manner of man this was, we entered
into conversation with him, and, to our surprise, found him very civil
and communicative.
He disclosed himself to be the famous BEN THoMAs, better known in
the columns of Bell's Life as “the Father of the London Fancy.” He told
us that he possessed a bulldog that could lick any other bulldog in
existence ; a terrier that could kill vermin with greater celerity than
any other terrier in Christendom ; that he had two badgers always
ready to be drawn ; and that he was never out of rats.
Finally, he tendered us his card, and invited us to call and inspect
his menagerie, any day we pleased, adding that we should “be safe to
find him or some of his kids at home.”
We accordingly proceeded, on Saturday last, to his villa near Padding-
ton, accompanied by the faithful Toby. MR. Thomas received us
in his picture gallery, which contains a unique collection of like-
nesses of the most distinguished canine gladiators of the Past and the
Present, on whose exploits and lineage he expatiated with an interest
which we confess was altogether incomprehensible to us, inasmuch as
such a strong family likeness pervades all the portraits that none but
a most experienced fancier could possibly discriminate between “the
silibrated Ecclesfield Nudger, wot licked the Tooting Trump in
ninety-sivin minutes,” and “the silibrated Whitechapel Nonpariel, wot
killed SAMBo SUTTON's original fighting Monkey, last Good Friday
wos a twelvemonth.”
They were all white, with one black eye a piece, preternaturally
underjawed, had heads like coalscuttles, powerful shoulders and loins,
parenthetical legs, slender sterns, and corkscrew tails.
On our expressing a wish to view his establishment, he courteously
ushered us into his pit, where MR. Thomas, Jun., and his two grandsons,
assisted by a desperate little villain of a terrier, well known in “the
drawing circles” as the Borough Dentist, were “a having a bit of
diversion with a badger.”
The moment our faithful Toby saw the badger, he set up a dismal
howl, and fled wildly, with a speed we had not previously attributed to
him. He was not discovered till the next day, when he was found, in
a state of extreme mental and bodily prostration, concealed in our coal-
hole, from which he was with great difficulty persuaded to emerge.
We in vain interceded for the animals, and endeavoured to stop the

sport. The MEssRs. Thomas assured us that “the Dentist” liked it, (as
indeed he most undoubtedly and unaccountably did) and maintained
that “badgers wos so tough, that nuffin couldn't hurt them ;” so we
left the family party to their singular pastime, and proceeded with the
Father of the Fancy to the Bull-dog department, which he considers as
his especial province, looking down upon “drawing” and “ratting” as
mere child's play.
In an area of about sixty yards square, as many bulldogs of all
sizes and ages were tethered to posts by short, and fortunately strong,
chains ; for when we entered the yard they unanimously sprang at us,
with an appalling yell. MR. THoMAs raised his hand and spoke to them
reprovingly, and they all slunk back abashed. He then introduced us
to them, assuring us fondly that they were the gentlest creatures in
existence, “if so be as they warn’t haggrawated; ” and in less than two
minutes we found ourselves on the most confidential terms with a set of
as truculent-looking ruffians as ever ran under a go-cart, and they
seemed much gratified by our notice and caresses.
MR. THoMAs's spirits rose as he surveyed his darling tykes, and he
confessed to us, that although the truly British sports of bull-baiting
and dog-fighting have been crushed by the pertinacious interference of
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, he still contrived
to earn a genteel livelihood by breeding these brave monsters for the
colonial and foreign markets. He said that he didn't want to fight any
more public matches, but he couldn't bear to see “the best blood in
England a heating the hosflesh of idleness,” and thought it hard he might
not amuse himself like a gentleman, in private, with a few friends.
He asked us why, when HER MAJESTY's Buck Hounds chase an un
happy deer along the flinty roads till his feet drop off, and then tear
him down with their fangs, the humane British public rejoice in the
feat, and denominate it approvingly, “a clipping thing with the
Queen's ; ” and why, when PRINCE ALBERT's beagles more deliberately
towler a wretched hare to death at the rate of six miles an hour, ulti-
mately eating her alive, they congratulate his Royal Highness on
having had “capital sport?”
“The Society's officers,” said he, “don’t never meddle with steeple-
chasing ; I never heerd tell of their troubling the nobby young dove
butchers at the Red House; they darn’t say a word to swells as bags
their two thousand head of game in three days on the Moors; but they
makes a dead set at such as me for indulgin' in a little Ka-nine on the
sly. They tells me, Mr. Punch, that you knows everything. I wish as
how you’d explain this here curious condick of the Society to me.”
We should have been considerably puzzled to do so. We therefore
simulated great anxiety for the fate of the truant Toby, and tendering
a gratuity of half-a-crown to the helper of the “Father of the Fancy,”
we took our departure.

better chiefs or leaders than these two gentlemen. “We don't want,”
the great county of Mangelwurzelshire seems to say, “that a man
should be able to write good grammar ; or that he should keep a
christian tongue in his head ; or that he should have the commonest
decency of temper, or even a fair share of good sense, in order to repre-
sent us in Parliament. All we require is, that a man should be recom-
And all that
we require of the EARL of MANGELwuRzELSHIRE is that he should
have fifty thousand a year and hunt the country.” O you pride of
all Snobland 1 O you crawling, truckling, self-confessed lackeys and
parasites 1
But this is growing too savage ; don't let us forget our usual
amenity and that tone of playfulness and sentiment with which the
beloved reader and writer have pursued their mutual reflections
hitherto. Well, Snobbishness pervades the little Social Farce as well
as the great State Comedy ; and the self-same moral is tacked to
either.
There was, for instance, an account in the papers of a young lady
who, misled by a fortune-teller, actually went part of the way to
India (as far as Bagnigge Wells, I think) in search of a husband who
was promised her there. Do you suppose this poor deluded little soul
would have left her shop for a man below her in rank, or for anything
but a darling of a Captain in epaulets and a red coat It was her
snobbish sentiment that misled her, and made her vanities a prey to
the swindling fortune-teller.
Case 2 was that of MADEMoISELLE DE SAUGRENUE “the interesting
young Frenchwoman with a profusion of jetty ringlets,” who lived
for nothing at a boarding-house at Gosport, was then conveyed to
Fareham gratis : and being there, and lying on the bed of the good
mattress, and steal a cash-box, with which she fled to London. How
would you account for the prodigious benevolence exercised towards
the interesting young French lady ? Was it her jetty ringlets or her
charming face—Bah ! Do ladies love others for having pretty faces
and black hair 2—She said she was a relation of Lord DE SAUGRENUE :
talked of her ladyship, her aunt, and of herself as a DE SAUGRENUE.
The honest boarding-house people were at her feet at once. Good
honest simple lord-loving children of Snobland.
Finally, there was the case of “the RIGHT Honoue ABLE ME.
VERNoN,” at York. The Right Honourable was the son of a noble-
man, and practised on an old lady. He procured from her dinners,
money, wearing apparel, spoons, implicit credence, and an entire refit
of linen. Then he cast his nets over a family of father, mother, and
daughters, one of whom he proposed to marry. The father lent him
money, the mother made jams and pickles for him, the daughters vied
with each other in cooking dinners for the Right Honourable—and
what was the end ? One day the traitor fled, with a tea-pot and a
basket-full of cold victuals. It was the “Right Honourable” which
baited the hook which gorged all these greedy, simple, Snobs. Would
they have been taken in by a commoner * What old lady is there,
my dear sir, who would take in you and me, were we ever so ill to do,
and comfort us, and clothe us, and give us her money and her silver
forks Alas and alas ! what mortal man that speaks the truth can
hope for such a landlady ? And yet, all these instances of fond and
credulous Snobbishness have occurred in the same week's paper, with
who knows how many score more ?
Just as we had concluded the above remarks comes a pretty little
note sealed with a pretty little butterfly—bearing a northern post
mark—and to the following effect:—
“Mr. Punch, * 19th November.
“Taking great interest in your Snob papers, we are very
anxious to know under what class of that respectable fraternity you
would designate us.
“We are three sisters, from seventeen to twenty-two. Our father is
homestly and truly of a very good family (you will say it is Snobbish to
mention that, but I wish to state the plain fact); our maternal grand-
father was an Earl."
“We can afford to take in a stamped edition of you, and all Dickens'
works as fast as they come out, but we do not keep such a thing as a
Peerage or even a Baronetage in the house.”
“We live with every comfort, excellent cellar, &c., &c., but as we
cannot well afford a butler we have a meat table-maid (though our
father was a military man, has travelled much, been in the best
society, &c.) We have a coachman and helper, but we don't put the
latter into buttons, nor make them wait at table, like STRIPEs and
TUMMUs."
“We are just the same to persons with a handle to their name as
to those without it. We wearamoderate modicum of crinoline,” and
are never limp" in the morning. We have good and abundant dinners
on china (though we have plate"), and just as good when alone as with
company.
“Now, my dear Mr. Punch, will you please give us a short answer in
your next number, and I will be so much obliged to you. Nobody
knows we are writing to you, not even our father; nor will we ever
teases you again if you will only give us an answer—just for fun,
now do | -
“If you get as far as this, which is doubtful, you will probably fling
it into the fire. If you do, I cannot help it; but I am of a sanguine
disposition, and entertain a lingering hope. At all events, I shall be
impatient for next Sunday, for you reach us on that day, and I am
ashamed to confess, we cannot resist opening you in the carriage driving
home from church."
“I remain, &c. &c., for myself and sisters.
“Excuse this scrawl, but I always write headlong.”"
“P. S. You were rather stupid last week, don't you think?" We
keep no gamekeeper, and yet have always abundant game for friends
to shoot in spite of the poachers. We never write on perfumed paper
—in short, I can't help thinking that if you knew us you would not
think us Snobs.”
To this I reply in the following manner —“My dear young ladies,
I know your post-town ; and shall be at church there the Sunday after
next; when, will you please to wear a tulip or some little trifle in your
bonnets, so that I may know you? You will recognise me and my dress
—a quiet-looking young fellow, in a white top coat, a crimson satin
neckcloth, light blue trowsers, with glossy tipped boots, and an emerald
breast-pin. I shall have a black crape round my white hat ; and my
usual bamboo cane with the richly-gilt knob. I am sorry there will
be no time to get up mustachios between now and next week.
“From seventeen to two-and-twenty 1 Ye gods ! what ages 1 Dear
* The introduction of Grandpapa is, I fear, Snobbish. -
b Bravo! Punch's Pocket Book is the thing, and these dear young ladies shall have a
presentation copy. - -
• That is, as you like. I don't object to buttons in moderation.
* Quite right. • Bless you!
f snobbsii : and I doubt whether you ought to dine as well when alone as with com-
any. You will be getting too good dinners.
g "We like to be teased ; but tell Papa. -
ho, garters and stars! what will CAPTAIN Gondon and Exeter Hall say to this? .
i Dear little enthusiast!
k You were never more mistaken, Miss, in your life.

young creatures, I can see you all three. Seventeen suits me, as near-
est my own time of life; but mind I don't say two-and-twenty is too
old. No, no. And that pretty, roguish, demure, middle one. Peace,
peace, thou silly little fluttering heart |
“You Snobs, dear young ladies I will pull any man's nose who
says so. There is no harm in being of a good family. You can't help
it, poor dears. What's in a name * What is in a handle to it 2 I
confess openly that I should not object to being a Duke myself; and
between ourselves, you might see a worse leg for a garter.
“You Snobs, dear little good-natured things, no l—that is, I hope
not—I think not—I won't be too confident—none of us should be—
that we are not Snobs. That very confidence savours of arrogance,
and to be arrogant is to be a Snob. In all the social gradations from
sneak to tyrant, nature has placed a most wondrous and various pro-
geny of Snobs. But are there no kindly natures, no tender hearts, no
souls humble, simple, and truth-loving 7 Ponder well on this question,
sweet young ladies. And if you can answer it, as no doubt you can—
lucky are you—and lucky the respected Herr Papa, and lucky the three
handsome young gentlemen who are about to become each others'
brothers-in-law.”

Oh Where, and Oh Wheref
This question is being asked by everybody in reference to the
intended position of the Wellington Statue. It is, we believe, in con-
templation to place it on the brow—that is to say, the high-brow—of
Primrose Hill, where it would be discernible from a considerable
distance. Some difficulty has arisen, on account of the disturbance of
yested interests which must take place by the dislodgement of the
brandy-ball dealers, and other merchants of saccharine who resort on
Sundays to the summit of the mount ; but this may be remedied by
opening the four legs of the horse as stalls for sweet-stuff. The pro-
position to place the Statue on the top of a hill is undoubtedly worth
considering ; but we see no reason for giving the preference to Primrose.
Holborn Hill might, with justice, put in a claim ; nor is there any reason
why Snow should be slighted.

A GRATEFUL COUNTRY.
LoRD John Russell, in his letter to Mas. MARSH-the widow of the
able chemist who discovered the subtle test for arsenic that bears his
name—informs her that he has no funds at his command out of which
to grant her the least pension. And we believe the noble lord. Large-
hearted JoHN BULL–with a Ministry for his almoner—allows just
twelve hundred a year for the reward of philosophers, poets, men of
science, and such cattle, lapsed into old age and inevitable penury.
Therefore, how—with the brief list full, with every farthing devoted—
how could LoRD John recommend the case of MRs. MARsh to the con-
siderate benevolence of the Crown Besides, it is said that the noble
Lord's letter might—had he chosen to put down all—have contained
the subjoined passage :-
“Lond John Russell has further to inform Mrs. MAR3h that, although her late
husband, whilst employed at the Ordnance, made a most useful discover", for which, it
is true, he never received any adequate reward—that, nevertheless, there are much more
imperative claims than any she can make, upon the pockets and the gratitude of the tax-
payer; namely, the claims of the Duchess of INvrBN Ess (widow of the Duke of
Sussex), for whom it is absolutely necessary that a trifle of one thousand a year should
be added to the Civil List.”
Now this simple statement could not have failed to reconcile the
widow of a man of genius to starve. Thousands for Duchesses, but
not one shilling for the widow of a public benefactor. So run rewards
in Merry England 1
A COMFORTABLE BERTH.
We see, among the musical chit-chat of a contemporary, an announce-
ment that HERR Pischek, the singer, is engaged at the Royal Theatre,
Wurtemberg, for life, with pensions for his wife and children in the
event of his decease. We do not hear of such arrangements on the
English stage, where a season is generally the extreme period for which
the services of a performer are secured. We cannot fancy an an-
nouncement in an English play bill, that “in consequence of the
immense success of Mr. So-and-So, he will have the honour of appearing
three times a week during the remainder of his existence.” We
presume that HERR Pische R is advertised to perform “every evening
for life,” at the Theatre Royal, Wurtemberg ; and it is probable that
when he turns fifty, his “positively last half century”. will, make a
standing line in the posters.
We approve of liberal treatment, but we think it would be a more
convenient arrangement to pay the performers in such a manner that
they could save a provision for their wives and families, instead of
leaving them to be perpetual claimants on the theatre after his death.
A Good Spec.
WE perceive that an autograph letter from the DUKE of WELLINGroN
has just realised the sum of 10s. 6d. by public auction. As F. M.
answers with his own hand every letter he receives, it would be a capi-
tal speculation to address him on any common-place subject and trans-
mit the answer, which he is certain to write, to the nearest auction-
room. Any one who has the effrontery to write to the Duke twice a
week would make sure of an income of fifty guineas per annum, suppos-
ing at least that the glut of autograph letters from F. M. does not
diminish their value.
APPROACHING DiSSOLUTION.
FEARs are entertained at Bristol that the Great Britain will be
breaking up shortly for the Christmas holidays. |

NEw “CAUSEs CELEBREs.”
EveRY sort of expedient has been suggested for raising the Great
Britain, but nothing tangible appears to have been yet hit upon. The
only feasible proposition yet made is one of our own, for getting the
vessel off the shore by the agency of the Nassau balloon, which is
we believe lying idle, and will not be required till the opening next year
of some of the suburban gardens. Two minor balloons might be used
as supplementary elevators of the enormous mass of naval architecture,
and the steamer might be carried right off to the dock where it may
be intended that the necessary repairs should be completed.
By the way, the same principle might be applied to the Wellington
Statue, which might be kept floating about over London while public
opinion is suspended as to the best site to assign to it.
CAUTION TO CUSTOMERS.
It is not perhaps generally known that there is considerable danger
in dealing with tradesmen of doubtful circumstances. A most lament-
able instance of annoyance has just come to our ears, and we publishit
as a warning to others who may be accidentally placed in the same
disagreeable position.
Agentleman had for some years employed the same person to make
his clothes, and had no reason to make any complaint whatever. Un-
fortunately the tradesman fell into difficulties and became bankrupt.
The result was that the customer was applied to for the debt, and was
actually compelled to pay his tailor. Such an unusual result had not
been anticipated by the gentleman, who complained loudly of being
obliged to pay for the imprudence or mismanagement of others.
We advise all persons to be very particular in having references as
to the stability and credit of the tailor they employ before committing
themselves to the chances of being inconvenienced by another indivi-
dual's bankruptcy.
LOUIS-PHILIPPE AND THE POLES.
THAT noble-minded, most ingenuous monarch, Louis-Prºſpee—that
NAroLeon of Pence—has attacked the Polish cause in Paris through its
pocket :-
“The editors of three papers, entitled The Third ºf May, the Polish Nation, and the
Polish Democracy, had been cited before the Tribunal of Correctional Police, for the
non-fulfilment of certainformalities, and for omitting to depositin the Treasurya security
of 50,000f. each. The object of that measure was evidently to obtain the suppression of
those journals.”
“Gold is the old man's sword,” says the poet; and—the NAPoleon of
Pence, sheathing the homicidal steel—stabs and cuts the throat of free-
dom with a weapon of more precious metal. He says he abominates
bloodshed; but does not scruple to knock down Liberty wherever he
meets her, with a money-bag.
Royal vengeance.
GEORGE THE FourTH, for breaking faith at Elba, sent NApoleon
| Bon APARTE to St. Helena. For doing the same thing in the Mont-
NApoleon of Peace, to-Coventry.
PENSIER marriage business, perhaps Queen VicroRIA will send the

hope it win stick to it.
LoRD BRough AM has had several little commissions intrusted to him -
since it was known that he executed French orders. Deputations
wait upon him every day, begging of him to undertake their “little
matter.” His trunks are bursting with papers—his pocket-book is
groaning under the weight of memoranda. The following-will give
§. faint idea of what the labours of Lond BRough AM will be next
ºs-----
There is the cause of Louis-PHILIPPE versus VicroRIA, in which
Lord BRough AM has promised not only to prove that his client has
been shamefully libelled, but also to obtain heavy damages for defama-
tion of character.
There is the complaint of the Gallie Cock, that 23,000,000 French
eggs are imported into England every year, to be brought up as
English chickens.
There is the case of the French feuilletonistes, who cry out for
vengeance, because God save the Queen was sung in English on the
opening night of the French
There are likewise the interests of the propriétaires of coco, and the
galette and brioche commerce, which Lond Brough AM has promised to
espouse with a view to their universal introduction into this country.
His word has also been pledged not to rest till the duty has been
taken off French beans.
He has likewise been retained by the Société des Arts et Sciences to
ascend in a balloon from Cremorne House, when the annular eclipse
of the sun takes place next twelvemonth, for the purpose of taking
observations as near to the spot as possible.
It has been amicably arranged at last, that his Lordship is to be the
London correspondent for the future of the Entr' Acte, but this is not
to affect his engagement in the least, of contributing a sheet a month
to the Petites Affiches.
WHAT’S THE MATTER WITH THE SPECTATOR
WE do not know what has come over the Spectator lately. It has
been attempting to be funny. The first symptom was exhibited a
month ago, and displayed itself in a violent effort to get a joke-out of
the word “Hyderabad,” by making poor SIR CHARLEs NAPIER do duty
they settled into the following confirmed case of Morning Herald-ism,
—“Goping and Co.'s horses dragged the effigy to the arch–MEux
and Co.'s ought to drag it away; for if it took more goading to bring
it there, it will befarmieux to carryit off.” The italics are not ours, but
the Spectator's own branding. Now we admire our clever contemporary
as much as anybody, but then it is in its own peculiar line, and we
Its real element is coldwater. It should retire
again as quickly as possible into its favourite “but.” We will overlook
its jokes this once, on its promising never to do so any more.
Holyrood Palace.
WHY will not Dukes march a little with the times? Why will men
with coronetslag solamentably behind steam-boat stokers and omnibus
drivers? We have penny and twopenny rides by land and water, for
which heretofore we paid sixpence. Why, then, if palaces are made
Since this outbreak the
| symptoms of punning have become aggravated, and on November 15th
show-places of why should we not have palaces like pine-apples, for
the million? Holyrood Palace is the property of the Duke of HAMIL-
Ton, and, though allººdinburgh is almost at a boiling heat—whobbling
to a civic riot—at his shamefully high charges, he will not exhibit his
royal cobwebs and spiders at a reduced price. Neitherwill he separate
the exhibition: showing—for a proportionate sum—the spider without
the cobweb, or the cobweb without the spider.
were we not speaking of a Duke, we should say it was shabby.
AN ENRAPTURED CRITIC.
ONE of our daily contemporaries in criticising the successful débât
of MADLLE. Fuoco, at Drury Lane, flies into raptures on the subject of
her appearance, and after declaring “her arms and legs are unexcep-
tionable,” bursts out into the ecstatic exclamation, “What a future
she has before her!” We have heard of people havingfortune in their
own hands, but here is a lady who has it in her legs also. Her features
are said to be “finely chiselled,” though she is perhaps, after all, only
the chip of some old block of a father to whom she bears resemblance.
It is suggested that she may amass wealth at pleasure, for a lady
who can do so much with her toes may calculate on having as much
money “down upon the mail” as she may desire.
This is too bad. Nay,

meeting of extremes in all the new arrangements, that there is no

“Strong Cordials, and other compounds ;” and there may therefore be be at all compared to it.
CASE FOR COUNSEL.
ow the secret popped out, we know not, but it
has lately been ascertained that the cele-
brated Brough AM has consented to resume
his position of advocate, “for this occasion
only,” in order to hold a brief in the great
cause of Louis-PHILIPPE against BRITANNIA.
The distinguished man who has under-
taken to act as counsel, has of course received
a special retainer. We have been fortunate
enough to see a copy of the brief, which is
endorsed in the usual manner, though we saw
no fee marked, but there was the customary
notice of “Consultation at six, at the Tuile-
ries,” and the ordinary words, “with you,”
were followed by the name of M. GUIzot.
The brief is, on the whole, a very curious
document, and we are glad of an opportunity
of being able to furnish a few extracts. It
is endorsed—“For the Defendant,” and is appointed for the sittings in
the House of Lords, which will come on about the beginning of Feb-
ruary. There are a few notices to produce, tacked on to the corner of
the first sheet, after the approved attorney's fashion. The documents
required to be produced, are certain letters alleged to have passed
between the defendant PHILIPPE and some other party, but it is be-
lieved that this is only a ruse to make it supposed such letters are in
existence. The defendant, among various other notices to admit, has
been called upon to admit the treaty of Utrecht, but he makes no
admission at all, and seems disposed to fight the case as obstinately as
possible.
The brief begins with the pleadings, which are set out in the usual
form. The declaration states that the defendant made certain promises
which he has not kept. The defendant then pleads—first, that he did
not promise ; secondly, that if he did promise, he has not broken his
promise ; thirdly, that if he has broken his promise, he had a right to
do so; fourthly, that somebody else promised ; fifthly, that there was
no promise at all ; and lastly, that he has kept his promise.
To this.the plaintiff replies, whereupon PhILIPPE rejoins, and at it
they both go, surrejoining, butting, rebutting, and surrebutting, until
i. throw themselves together on the country, whereupon “issue
is joined.”
The Case for Counsel is written in a very plausible style, but it
admits that there is really no defence to the action. The old piece of
legal advice, “abuse the other party,” is very prominently put forward.
We understand that at the consultation it was a matter of some dis-
cussion whether any witnesses should be called, but it was at length
agreed that though the witnesses within reach would all swear what-
ever was required of them, they might all be shaken to pieces in cross-
examination. Something was said about calling witnesses to character,
but as it was understood that not one of them would be believed, this
point was abandoned. It was also thought very desirable to prevent a
reply, which it was felt would be fatal. BRough AM has been very busy
in looking up cases as precedents, but unfortunately not one that he
has been able to meet with is considered an authority. Something has
been said about getting the matter referred to arbitration; but this
would only be an expedient on the part of PHILIPPE to gain time,
and the proposition would therefore most likely be rejected by the
plaintiff.
MURDER BY WHISKY.
It would seem that murder was allowed in England, if the deed be
done by means of alcohol. The Daily Newsnarrates a recent case. An idiot
mendicant, named ALLAN, or Willie the Runner, of Laytown, Cumber-
land, a few days since—as was his wont—solicited drink or money of a
bridal party. Whereupon, a man named T. GIBsoN called for six half-
pints of raw whisky for the doomed simpleton —
“Deceased swallowed several of the draughts with all the avidity and haste his brutal
entertainer could desire, but during the latter part of the disgusting performance the poor
idiot appeared to feel satiated, and the beverage to become unpalatable to him. GIBson
previously encouraged deceased by saying, “he would make a gentleman of him.”
now urged on the old man by threatening ‘to knock his head through the bar if he did
not drink up the contents of the glass.” There were several other persons in the same
room, who from time to time remonstrated with Gibson. They told him “he would most
assuredly kill the man, and that he ought to recollect that the man had a soul to be saved
like the rest of them.’”
And the end of this 2 Why, the idiot fell down senseless, and died
the same night. An inquest was held upon the body, and the verdict
returned was, “that deceased died from excessive drinking,” but with-
out implicating any one. Should MADAME TUssaud need a supply of
human curiosities, we would recommend to her notice a Cumberland
jury—whose verdict supplies this new and startling truth, that an
idiot may be murdered with impunity, if murdered with whisky I

MR. GRANTLEY BERRELEY, in his evidence before the Game Com-
mittee, says, “If the prosperity and happiness of the farmer is to be
considered, and he is to be a farmer, and not half farmer, half sports-
man, half poacher, and half game dealer, the less he meddles with
sporting rights the better.” Would the honourable member tell us how
to combine such a quantity of half-and-half into one body ? or would
his celebrated “punch on the head” reduce a man to the vulgar
fraction of four halves 7

THE SNOBS OF ENGLAND.
BY ONE OF THEMSELVES.
CHAPTER XL.-SNOBS AND MARRIAGE.
E VERYBODY Of the
'middle rank who
walks through this
life with a sympathy
for his companions
on the same journey
—at any rate, every
man who has been
jostling in the world
for some three or four
lustres—must make
no end of melancholy
reflections upon the
fate of those victims
* whom Society,that is,
Snobbishness, is im-
molating every day.
With love and sim-
plicity and natural
kindness Snobbishness is perpetually at war. People dare not be
happy for fear of Snobs. People dare not love for fear of Snobs.
People pine away lonely under the tyranny of Snobs. Honest kindly
hearts dry up and die. Gallant generous lads, blooming with hearty
youth, swell into bloated old-bachelorhood, and burst and tumble over.
| Tender girls wither into shrunken decay, and perish solitary, from
whom Snobbishness has cut off the common claim to happiness and
affection with which Nature endowed us all. My heart grows sad as
I see the blundering tyrant's handywork. As I behold it I swell with
cheap rage, and glow with fury against the Snob. Come down, I say,
thou skulking dullness. Come down, thou stupid bully, and give up
thy brutal ghost 1 And I arm myself with the sword and spear, and
taking leave of my family, go forth to do battle with that hideous ogre
and giant, that brutal despot in Snob Castle, who holds so many gentle
hearts in torture and thrall.
When Punch is king, I declare there shall be no such thing as old
maids and old bachelors. The REveREND MR. MALTHUs shall be
burned annually, instead of GUY FAwREs. Those who don't marry
shall go into the workhouse. It shall be a sin for the poorest not to
. have a pretty girl to love him.
The above reflections came to mind after taking a walk with an old
comrade, JACK SPIGGOT by name, who is just passing into the state
of old bachelorhood, after the manly and blooming youth in which I would be a brute wh
remember him. JACK was one of the handsomest fellows in England ºr, e a dru o
when we entered together in the Highland Buffs ; but I quitted the
Cutty kilts early, and lost sight of him for many years.
Ah how changed he is from those days 1 He wears a waistband
now, and has begun to dye his whiskers. His cheeks, which were red,
are now mottled ; his eyes, once so bright and stedfast, are the colour
of peeled plovers' eggs.
“Are you married, JACK ?” says I, remembering how consumedly
in love he was with his cousin LETTY LovELACE, when the Cutty kilts
were quartered at Strathbungo some twenty years ago.
“Married ? no,” says he. “Not money enough. Hard enough to
keep myself, much more a family, on five hundred-a-year. Come to
DickINson's ; there's some of the best Madeira in London there, my
boy.” So we went and talked over old times. The bill for dinner'and
wine consumed was prodigious, and the quantity of brandy-and-water
that JACK took showed what a regular boozer he was. “A guinea or
two guineas. What the devil do I care what I spend for my dinner 7”
says he.
“And LETTY LovELACE,” says I.
JAck's countenance fell. However, he burst into a loud laugh
presently. “LETTY LovELACE " says he. “She’s LETTY LovELACE
still ; but Gad, such a wizened old woman 1 She's as thin as a
thread-paper; (you remember what a figure she had); her nose has
got red, and her teeth blue. She's always ill; always quarrelling
with the rest of the family; always psalm-singing, and always taking
pills. Gad, I had a rare escape there. Push round the grog, old boy.”
Straightway memory went back to the days when LETTY was the
loveliest of blooming young creatures: when to hear her sing was to
make the heart jump into your throat; when to see her dance, was
better than Montessu or Noblet (they were the Ballet Queens of
those days); when JACK used to wear a locket of her hair, with a
little gold chain round his neck, and, exhilarated with toddy, after a
sederunt of the Cuttykilt mess, used to pull out this token, and kiss
it, and howl about it, to the great amusement of the bottle-nosed old
Major and the rest of the table.
“My father and her's couldn't put their horses together,” JACK said.
“The General wouldn't come down with more than six thousand. My
Governor said it shouldn't be done under eight. LovELACE told him
to go and be hanged, and so we parted company. They said she was
in a decline. Gammon l She's forty, and as tough and as sour as
this bit of lemon peel. Don't put much into your punch, SNoB, my
boy. No man can stand punch after wine.”
“And what are your pursuits, JACK ?” says I.
“Sold out when the Governor died. Mother lives at Bath. Go
down there once a year for a week. Dreadful slow. Shilling whist.
Four sisters—all unmarried except the youngest—awful work. Scot-
land in August. Italy in the winter : cursed rheumatism. Come to
London in March, and toddle about at the Club, old boy; and we won't
go home till maw-aw-rning till daylight does appear.”
“And here's the wreck of two lives 1” mused the present Snobogra-
pher, after taking leave of JACK SPIggot. “Pretty merry LETTY
LovELACE's rudder lost and she cast away, and handsome JACK SPIGGOT
stranded on the shore like a drunken Trinculo.”
What was it that insulted Nature (to use no higher name), and
perverted her kindly intentions towards them 2 What cursed frost
was it that nipped the love that both were bearing, and condemned
the girl to sour sterility, and the lad to selfish old-bachelorhood 2 It
was the infernal Snob tyrant who governs us all, who says, “Thou
shalt not love without a lady's-maid; thou shalt not marry without a
carriage and horses; thou shalt have no wife in thy heart, and no
children on thy knee, without a page in buttons and a French bonne;
thou shalt go to the devil unless thou hast a Brougham ; marry poor,
and society shall forsake thee; thy kinsmen shall avoid thee as a
criminal ; thy aunts and uncles shall turn up their eyes and bemoan
the sad sad manner in which ToM or HARRY has thrown himself away.”
You, young woman, may sell yourself without shame, and marry old
CROEsus ; you, young man, may lie away your heart and your life for
a jointure. But if you are poor, wo be to you ! Society, the brutal
Snob autocrat, consigns you to solitary perdition. Wither, poor girl,
in your garret; rot, poor bachelor, in your Club.
When I see those graceless recluses—those unnatural monks and
nuns of the order of St. BEELzEBUB,” my hatred for Snobs and their
worship, and their idols, passes all continence. Let us hew down that
man-eating JuggeRNAUT, I say, that hideous Dagon; and I glow
with the heroic courage of ToM THUMB, and join battle with the giant
Snob.
* This of course is understood to apply only to those unmarried persons whom a
mean and Snobbish fear about money has kept from fulfilling their natural destiny.
Many persons there are devoted to celibacy because they cannot help it. Of these a man
spoke roughly. Indeed, after Miss O'Toole's conduct to the
he would be the last to condemn. But never mind, these are personal matters.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
T. KETTLE'S PETITION TO PARLIAMENT.
Now LYING For sIGNATURE AT PUNCH's of FICE.
! May it please your Honourable House. The Petition of T. KETTLE
Humbly Sheweth—
THAT your Petitioner is happily endowed
- - with vocal talents, having earned an exten-
Nº ºs sive reputation for singing; in which art he is
- ~miº "º esteemed a greater proficient than the famous
ſ| Mouse which your Honourable House may
- 'ſ have heard of: That the services of your
Petitioner as a vocalist are in much request
in families ; wherein he is universally admit-
ted to be a great promoter of domestic har-
mony: That your Petitioner is anxious that
his sphere of usefulness should be extended
as widely as possible ; whereas, owing to a
T certain fiscal regulation, its limits are unhap-
pily circumscribed : Your Petitioner alludes
to the duty on Tea, which has the effect of
banishing him from many firesides of which
his melody is the only solace.
That the singing of your Petitioner is a
necessary accompaniment to the cup that
“cheers but not inebriates : " That sugar, being an element in the said
cup, its consumption would, by the more extensive engagements of
your Petitioner, be vastly augmented, to the immense increase of the
revenue : That bread and butter having also, with the cup aforesaid,
a close connexion, would likewise be eaten in larger quantities, to the no
small advantage of agriculture: That the voice of your Petitioner,
in proportion to its exertions, will promote our commercial relations
with China: Your Petitioner, therefore, humbly begs that, by taking
off the above-mentioned duty on Tea, you will allow him the free exer-
cise of his musical talents.
And your Petitioner, as in duty bound, will ever sing.
REASONS FOR GIVING PENSIONS.
WE understand that a petition is lying" for signature at Glasgow,
calling on the Government to give a pension to SHERIDAN KNowLEs,
on account of the great accessions he has made to the dramatic litera-
ture of his country. Though we approve of the object of the people
of Glasgow, we do not agree with them at all in setting up a claim for
KNowLEs on the ground of his being our greatest living dramatist.
Judging from the reason that caused the bestowal of a pension not long
ago, on some person whose great maternal baby's great"grandfather had
been of some assistance in saving CHARLEs in some dilemma—judging,
we say, from this, we are surprised that the men of Glasgow have not
been sharp enough to prepare a host of hereditary claims on the part
of KNowLEs, which would weigh more heavily in his favour than all
the Hunchbacks, Wives, Virginiuses, and William Tells, in Christendom.
We have made some inquiries, and are happy to be able to give a few
wholesome hints, of which the men of Glasgow may at once avail
themselves in order to make out a strong case for KNowLEs to have a
pension.
Knowles's great ancestor was one of the wood-cutters engaged in the
forest when CHARLEs hid in the tree, and is reputed to have caught a
| glimpse of the king among its branches. KNowles—then called old
KNow-ELSE, from his knowing nothing else—was about to betray his
master, when a wink from the latter silenced the honest fellow, who, it
seemed, had been a beef-eater in the late king's service. Surely, by
virtue of this brilliant achievement and loyal act of his ancestor,
KNow LEs must be entitled to a pension.
But if this case is not strong enough, what shall be said of his having
had another ancestor, who rubbed down the horse of Hors.A, several
centuries ago, and was as faithful to one set of reigning authorities as
he would have been to any other set he might happen to have lived
under P Undoubtedly, though SHERIDAN KNow Les may not deserve a
pension for his own dramatic works, he must have one by virtue of
some of his progenitors.
THE Acte Général of the Congress of Vienna, that guaranteed for
ever the liberty and neutrality of Cracow, begins with these solemn
words—“In the name of the Most Holy and Indivisible Trinity.” And
the liberty, the neutrality of Cracow is set at nought—violated

professional impressions of burglars, seem taken in nothing harder
than wax, that they may, at fitting opportunity, plunder accordingly.

EDUCATION AT THE WOOLWICH ACADEMY.
Y the newspapers it appears that intoxication,
lying, swearing, bullying, and other elegant
accomplishments are all that can be learnt
at the Royal Academy at Woolwich. It is
desirable, therefore, that these matters should
be placed under the superintendence of the
regular authorities. We should propose, there-
fore, that courses of instruction should be
and the greatest blackguard in the Academy
at the annual period.
It might be as well to give lectures on some
of the principal matters which seem to form
the subject of education at the Royal Military
Academy. The following would perhaps form
a desirable division of the studies of the cadets
at that establishment. -

Tactics—and Dram Drinking.
Tuesday. Swearing—Euclid—and the use of the Tobacco Pipe.
Wednesday. Bullying—Science of Gunnery—Intoxication—Fencing

Thursday. Mathematics—The Use of the Oath—and Single-Stick.

AN ASYLUM FOR DESTITUTE STATUEs.
WE think an Asylum for va-
grant statues ought really
to be established in the
metropolis. There was the
melancholy case of the statue
of Lord Byron, who did not
know where to rest his head
for years; there was the
unfortunate George THE
FourTH, of King's Cross
celebrity, whose frame was
completely shattered, and
ultimately broken up, from
there being no retreat where
he could retire to in his pre-
mature old age; and there is
now the Mammoth Horse, at
present standing at livery at
- Hyde Park Corner, who has
ºr not a home which he can call
– his own. We have heard,
also, of another statue, who
Eis wandering about the face
- of the earth in search of a
- comfortable asylum where he
= can rest his wearied legs.
EThis melancholy wanderer is
- the statue of Lord Lons-
= pair, who has been turned
Fout of his situation at
T Carlisle, which it seems he
filled very badly, and is now
the statue as viewed from the connen or running about in search of a
G-o-o------ new place; but till he is
fitted, he will be as badly off
as the unsitely monster “left until called for" in Piccadilly.
Under these circumstances, an asylum, we think, ought to be built
for these poor outcasts, and a temporary shed ought immediately to be
run up to guard them against the severity of the approaching winter.
It is terrible to think that the Duke's Statue should be left out in the
cold, exposed to all weathers, and not a person to raise his voice to ask
him to walkinſ
Great 3Legal gºunt.
THE great legal hunting season having recently commenced, we have
enjoyed one or two runs with the hounds, of which we have some very
pleasant reminiscences. The meet took place at the beginning of the
usual term, and the great pack of forensic fox-hounds, evinced consider-
able eagerness to escape from the inactivity of the long vacation.
The object of the meet was to give the dogs a few trials. Several
Rnowing old gentlemen had consented to act as judges, and the dogs
were set on by the attorneys, who acted as huntsmen and whippers-in
with their usual energy. A few of the forensic dogs were a little feeble
until they had been refreshed, when they began to give tongue very
vehemently. Some of these were mere inexperienced whelps, and were
restrained by the judges; but there was no restriction on the sport.
When a provisional committee stag was turned out, and the
whole pack, having scented him out, threw off in full cry after him,
the victim, who was as sly as any puss, dodged about very cleverly
for some time, and looked imploringly up at a high bench, but it afforded
no refuge. Away went the hunters at a slapping pace, and even the
judges at first seemed inclined to join in the pursuit of the provisional
stag ; until it occurred to them that they were only there to see fair
play, and not to aid in hunting down the unfortunate animal. The
poor brute, as if pleading for its life, took advantage of a sort of five-
barred plea—or five pleas in bar—but the hunters and hounds either
demolished or leapt over the quintuple obstacle. Away they went,
altogether, in beautiful style, and they were just on the point of running
the provisional stag to earth, when he had recourse to water, and con-
triving to keep his head above it, got as far as Boulogne, where he
kept his hunters at bay very beautifully.
otsatisfied with being baffled of their prey, the hunters turned out
an old fox who had got on to a railway-line, and in trying to make his
escape had become entangled in the intricacy of several branches. The
hunters and their forensic dogs thought they had got him safe, when he
took a sharp turn, and struck cleverly offinto the cover of the Court of
Bankruptcy. The expenses of the hunting season are defrayed by
amateur sportsmen, who pay the huntsmen handsomely, and allow a
good deal of money to go to the dogs—the forensic pack—at every
meeting.
THE USE OF SIGNALS.
A Poor stoker, who learnt his signals by being engaged in nineteen
accidents on the Eastern Counties Railway, writes to us in the most
pathetic manner about the coloured lights exhibited outside the
surgeons' doors. He says that, from old associations, he cannot see a
green light without feeling nervous, or a white one without a cold
shiver; whilst ared one makes him unwell for the remainder of the
day. He feels all these sensations at once, every time he passes a
surgeon's illumination, and he wishes to know if there is any clause
in Magna Charta to prevent surgeons from frightening people to death
by affixing such fearful signals to their shops? Is it done, he asks,
for the purpose of entrapping a stray customer; or are surgeons and
chemists naturally such dangerous members of society, that they are
compelled, by Act of Parliament, to burn signals outside their shops to
warn people of their danger ? We can hardly think so; for if this
were the law, every life-pill concoctor and lawyer in the kingdom
would have to stick nothing but red-lights over his door. However,
we have submitted the question raised by “Stoker" to MR. Brmer-
Less, for counsel's opinion. If there is no precedent, he may depend
upon it. Ma. BRIEFLess will make one.
THE MAYOR'S LAMENT FOR THE LOSS OF THE TURTLES.

Several hundred lively turtles were thrown overboard a little while
ago from a ship bound for Liverpool. The Mayor of that town, who is
remarkable for hospitality, has been, ever since the sad event, in a
state of fearful despondency. The following touching lament has been
heard to issue from his windows at fitful and feverish intervals—
Know ye the loss of the beautiful turtles,
The emblems of soup, had they lived to this time?
Oh bind up my brows with the leaves of some myrtles,
Let me mourn for the loss of a feast so sublime.
Did they do it from fear 2–did they do it in fun?
Sure no one could smile at the mischief they’ve done.
Had shipwreck been threaten'd, and had it been known,
That everything must have been overboard thrown,
Though the whole of the freight in the ocean were cast,
The turtles should always be kept till the last.
Oh, had I been there in that terrible hour,
As Mayor I'd at once have exerted my power,
And made the most active endeavours to save
The turtle alive, from a watery grave.
I envy thee, NEPTUNE-for thou art possess'd
Of a treasure by which I had hoped to be blessed;
I'm almost disposed to make one of thy group,
And drown myself, just to come in for the soup.

Tun Rev. Wm. ALBEMARLE CAmon, rector of Carshalton, has been
fined £4 for cruelly beating a boy of fourteen, whose crime was this-
he played at “hockey” before the good man's door! “The boy's
clothes,” say the papers, “were taken off in court, and his back exhi-
bited several large bruises, evidently caused by violent beating.” In
the olden day the wand of the priestburst into sweet-smelling blossoms,
but the stick of PARson Caton bears, as gardeners would say, a very
different sort of “blow.”

THE PRIZE PIG AND THE PRIZE PEASANT.
I NEveR pass a fat pig by,
But off I take my hat,
And “I'm your servant, Sir,” says I:—
What makes me act like that ? "
Why, because I’ve been taught to behave as I ought,
And know my own degree ;
And I never neglect to pay proper respect,
When 'tis due from me.
For forty years, as man and boy,
I’ve driven my master's plough ;
Was never out of his employ,
And still am in it now :
My children and wife I have kept all my life
From off the parish clear:
But merit like mine, to the worth of a swine,
People think small beer.
True I've not toil'd so long for nought :
I’ve met with some reward :
And so, perhaps, you’ll say I ought,
Or else it would be hard.
A prize I receiv'd :-the good gentlefolks griev'd
They couldn't give more to me;
Two pounds was the touch,-and a cow got as much ;
But a fat hog, three.
So to a pig I make my bow,
As manners do require,
And touch my hat to boar and sow,
With Parson and with 'Squire.
Though a Christian am I, yet a pig in a sty
My betters is, I see ; -
For the pig makes fine pork, and I’m nearly past work;
And they can't eat me !
A RUNAWAY ENGINE. -
ECENTLY the papers contained a cu-
rious account of an engine having
run away on the South Eastern Rail-
way. There was always considered
to be one comfort in railway travel-
ling, which might be balanced against
its numerous risks, that the engines
were at all events not liable, like
horses, to take fright, run away, or
perform any freaks of dangerous and
unexpected character. If it is found
that the engines are addicted to
tricks of this alarming description,
there will be a fresh source of anx-
iety to railway travellers. As far
as we can learn, the engine in this
case was somewhat too highlymettled
and the result was quite in analogy with what we might have antici-
pated from the equestrian animal. Had the incident occurred on the
Eastern Counties line we should have attributed it to the natural
impatience of an engine fretted and grown restive at being kept back
after its proper hour for starting.

Threepenny Theatres.
WE have got twopenny and threepenny omnibuses ; and, as nearly
every stage tries to keep pace with an omnibus, we have got threepenny
theatres. It is true that those who enter the latter find them sometimes
very slow coaches, which seldom can boast of getting into a good run;
but the intention shown in the reduction is laudable. We understand
it is in contemplation at the Victoria to charge the night's entertain-
ments at a penny a piece all round, taking the good with the bad, or
a halfpenny an act ; and for the accommodation of servants or juve-
miles, a single scene will be served out at a still lower figure. Those
who prefer only the comic portions, may come in for the funny incidents,

THE ENGLISH IN LITTLE.
BY GENERAL TOM THUMB,
TOM THUMBTAKES TEA IN THE ROYAL BACK ROOM-IS DIPLOMATIC,
- And INVITES HER MAJESTY TO AMERICA.
ELL, I sot a stirrin and a stirrin my
cup, and afore I'd tasted the smallest
grain of tea I felt myself as snug in
the Royal Back Room—and a mighty
pretty location it was—as though I’d
been raised there. “Gen'ral, is your
tea to your likin 7” says Gracious
Majesty, smilin like a pictur. Now,
to say the truth, the tea was first
chop, but as a citizen of the freest
nation on airth, it wasn't for me to
say so. I should think not. There-
fore, puckerin my mouth like a but-
ton-hole, and givin my head a shake
as if I’d swallowed pison, I said,
“Jist the smallest notion more gun-
A powder.” Whereupon Gracious Ma-
s jesty smiled agin, and spooned out the
green. Then a Maid-of-honour give
me another cup, and another Maid
brought me the cream-jug, and
another Maid the sugar-basin. And
as they stood about me, they kept
so lookin down upon me, and poutin
their pretty lips, and sighing for all
the world as if they'd straws in their
precious mouths and I was sherry-cobbler that they was drinkin up.
“It’s a little warm, gals,” said I, by way of a small hint, for in a
minute I thought I shouldn't breathe. I thought my life would
be strained away through white muslin.
“Ladies,” said Gracious Majesty, “I’m afeard you’re troublesome
to the Gem'ral.”
“Not at all, Gracious Majesty,” said I, for I'm materally tender to
the critters; tho’, to say the special, I don't like 'em swarmin about
me at all times. Everything in its place, as Uncle PHIL said when
he threw aunt in the horse-pond.
Well, I got on pretty smart, and was mighty pleased to be sure ;
tho’, for the honour of the Republic, I wouldn't diskiver it. “No,”
said I to myself, “I’ll take the best they can give me, as if I was born
to it, like an American citizen. I'm determined nothin shall surprise
grits: a pint of sifted Indian meal; a teaspoonful of salt; three
table-spoonfuls of fresh butter; three eggs ; three table-spoonfuls of
strong yeast ; a quart of milk; a salt-spoonful of pearl-ash or sal-
aratus"—and here I stopt short.
“Well, Gen'ral,” said Gracious Majesty, “and when I have got
these, what then 7°
“Why, then, Gracious Majesty,”—said I-" my mother will show
you how to mix 'em. The dear old critter's in London, and any arter-
noon is at your service ; providin always with the compliment of a
coach-and-six to bring her, where the flag flies, at the front gate,” for
I was determined to have no more of the back-stairs.
Upon this Gracious Majesty larfed so hearty, and showed sich
rows of pearls, they'd have shined better in her crown than the rael
ones, I'm certain. “Gen'ral, you're very good, I’m much beholden to
you,” said Gracious Majesty, and agin she larfed; and the Honour
Maids larfed too, though in course, smaller than their missus. And
now, seein I was making my way like any liner, I thought I'd give
the republic a turn, and do no harm neither to the British. So I said,
—“Gracious Majesty, if you'd like to eat the real Hominy Cake in
airnest, I allot that you had better eat it at Uncle SAM's fireside,
You've a nice little steamer, and in the summer go paddlin’ about the
sea, to blow away the cares of state ; and take out the marks that
etarnally wearin that heavy crown must bring upon your tender fore-
head.” And here, I thought to myself, crowns ought to be well lined
with bank-notes to make 'em fit at all easy. “Yes, Gracious Majesty,
you and your husband—and I will say this to his face, a very fine
young man he is, and I doubt not, a tarnation good shot with a rifle
—you go to France, and eat frog-pies with Louis-PHILIPPE, and it's
only my hope that that cunnin critter (for he'd skin a weasel without
wakin him) won't some day eat up all the molasses, and give you
nothin but the basin”—(If I’d said Spanish liquorish instead of
molasses, could I ha’ been a grain nearer the truth 7)—“You go and
visit the King of the French, and the Duke of Cobourgers, and the
King of the Prushys, and sich like, why not some summer get up the
steam, and jist run over to take a bite of Hominy Cake with the
Yankees P’’
Well, Gracious Majesty looked for all the world as if I’d hit at
one blow the very nail her mind had long been hammerin' on. So I
follows it up.
“We’ve plenty of room in the States,” says I, “for your husband
and all the dear children at Astor House. And there, I guess, the dear
critters won't be cramped up, as I larn they are here, but may grow
and expand like corn cobs. Bless you,” said I, for I got sudden
familiar, “dear critters There's somethin like airl Send their
royal highnesses to bed at night, and they’d grow so, you'd disown
'em in the morning.”
“And, Gen'ral,” said Gracious Majesty, “you think they’d make
me. If Gracious Majesty gives me the crown of England to hold my
marbles in, why, I'll keep a stiff upper lip ; praps I’ll say “thankee,’
praps I won't.” Asfor Governor BARNUM, Inever seed a man so starched
on a sudden. He seemed froz with royalty, like a dead hog in a Nova
Scotia winter. But for me, well, Isot in my chair like any ostrich
feather in the Maids' heads—as easy, and, for all the world, as
handsum.
“Gen'ral, what do you think of our muffins 7" said Gracious
Majesty.
Afore I could answer, I could see BARNUM's eye burnin on me like
a blue-light. “Steady, Gen'ral; mind what you're about. Muffins
is a leadin question. Steady; or she has you high and dry upon the
Corn Laws.” Though the Governor only scrooged and quivered his
eye a little, I could see he meant all this. Whereupon, I jist bobbed
my tongue agin my cheek, as much as to say to him, “Of all the days
I was born, it wasn't yesterday.”
“What do you think of our muffins 2 " again axed Gracious
Majesty.
Whereupon, I smiled down the corners of my mouth into my waist-
coat pockets, and answered by asking, “What, Gracious Majesty, do
you think of our Hominy Cakes 7"
“Hominy cakes, Gen'ral 1 I never heerd of 'em,” said Gracious
Majesty.
I was jist going to cry out, where was you born ?—when I remem-
bered, in Kinsington Gardens. So I only said—“Never heerd of Ho-
miny Cakes 1 You never say so 2°
“Upon my honour, Gen'ral,” says Gracious Majesty, laying her
white hand solemn on the tea-caddy.
Whereupon I clears my throat, as if I was goin to speak in Con-
gress, and stretchin out my right hand—for an Honour Maid near me
run for my cup and sarcer—and said—“Get a pint of small Hominy |
me welcome in the States ?”
“Welcome !” cried I, “they'd make you up a bed of Pennsylvanian
bonds—and you know how tarnation sound the critters have slept
upon them—and, for a counterpane, kiver you with the star-spangled
banner.”
THE SMITHFIELD ABOMINATION.
WE understand that the authorities of the City have come to the de-
termination to abolish Smithfield as a Cattle Market, as soon as an
one of the subjoined casualties shall, from the driving of oxen tº:
the streets of London, occur —
Whenever a Lord MAYor: shall have his carriage windows broken,
or even flawed—
Whenever an Alderman shall be slightly tossed—
Whenever three members of the Court of Common Council shall be
gored to death; leaving a widow a piece, and in all, not less than
fifteen children—
And it is further decided, until any such dreadful calamity shall
occur to such LoRD MAYor—such Alderman—or such Common Coun-
cilmen, that no gorings or killings, inflicted upon any man, woman, or
child, shall be considered in any other light than as an inevitable acci-
dent, to be endured with the most Christian-like and uncomplaining
resignation 1 -

THE Pope—good fellow !—is gulled : and England especially fobbed
of her sympathy and indignation under false pretence. There is no
Abbess of Minsk. No aged nun tortured under the auspices of that
devout Christian, the EMPERoR Nicholas—“one so tender of his own
Church's purity, as in practice to surrender his prerogative to the
Holy Synod in the nomination of the Russian Bishops.”—No ; the
whole story is a wicked flam, invented to slander the best of emperors.

the Nun " Give us back our tears; for we will not be cheated of
those precious commodities, as they are not to be lightly and lavishly
thrown away.”
There is no Abbess of Minsk, says MR. PhILLIPs: we must, however,
have some better authority than his, ere we can believe in her non-
entity. Should the Emperor, however, chance to want a new throne,
MR. PHILLIPs is quite ready to give him a character from his last
place. He is “the most accomplished Prince in Europe.” By the
way, every Prince is ; the Prince of Darkness (if he keep a PHILLIPs,)
included. He is, moreover, “the best of husbands and fathers.” How
does MR. Howell, PHILLIPs know 2 To be sure, if we doubted the
despot's veneration for the conjugal tie, we should cease to do so, recol-
lecting that he never separated husbands and wives by thousands, to
people Siberia; and that he is so excellent a father, he could not—how
could he—kidnap babes from Poland.
And who is “How ELL J. PHILLIPs, M. A. 2” We know not ; care
not. But, doubtless, the Parcels' Delivery cart will, in due season, find
him out, with a fitting present from Nicholas—sent through his am-
bassador. Possibly it may be a snuff-box set with diamonds; though,
for our part, considering the quantity of scented soap PhILLIPs has
expended upon the Emperor, we think he would be more fittingly
rewarded by a present of good Russia towelling.
DREADFUL OUTRAGE ON THE CONTINENT.
PARTICULARs have been sent to the Hue and Cry, of a most daring
robbery that has been committed at Cracow. It seems that when
everything was quiet, three notorious offenders got into the grounds
by force, broke through a treaty that stood in their way, demolished
everything of value they found in the houses of legislature, turned
the whole concern topsy-turvy, and have not left a vestige of the old
place standing. One of the offenders, who is well known to the police
by the name of Austria, is still in possession. His two confederates
have been content with their share of the booty, and have returned to
their old haunts. Their designations are Russia and Prussia. No
means have been taken as yet for the restoration of the stolen property.
It is supposed that the authorities are holding back in the hopes of a
reward being offered.

PUNCH*S IMAGINARY CONVERSATIONS.
WILLIAM COBBETT AND SIR WALTER RALEIGH.
SCENE–The other world.
Cobbett. OH ! There you are, SIR WALTER. Come, shake hands. My
crow's plucked at last. I will speak to you, now.
Raleigh. And right welcome, MAstER Cobbett. You have been wont
hitherto to use scurvy language of me ; why, I know not ; and civilities
have been scant between us. I rejoice to think they shall be frequent
henceforth.
Cobbett. Yes, yes. To tell you the plain truth, I could not bear the
sight of you. Don't look so black ; but it was you colonised Virginia,
and introduced into Ireland that vile, watery, rotgut thing, the potato.
Raleigh. Nay, these be strange reasons for sulky looks. Did I not,
by the one act, add to our empire a fair territory, fertile in all manner
of grain, well-watered, and as MASTER HARIoT doth still opine, rich in
the precious metals; and, by the other, bring into our Britain a deli-
cate fruit, right flavourous and wholesome for confections and sweet-
meats 2
Cobbett. Fiddle-de-diddle !
Raleigh. Truly you trouble me much, MasTER Cobb ETT. But why
your wrath against that wholesome root, the openawk, as the savages
called it, but which we named after the Spaniard, “potato” ”
Cobbett. Wholesome root ' Don't put me in a passion. Do you
know that your precious “wholesome root” has become the food of
two-thirds of England, Ireland, and Scotland Ž It is pigs’ meat,
and has made pigs of the poor people who use it. I did what I could.
I told all sensible Englishmen, those who took in my Register, what it
would come to. It's true I didn't use the gallipot phrases that these
Oxford and Cambridge doctors, in their black gowns and conjuring
caps, have dosed people with till their stomachs might have turned at
the gibberish if not at the thing itself—your precious potato I mean.
I didn't write such nonsensical words as your solanums, and tubers, and
albumen, and protein, and fibrine, but I said, in plain Hampshire
English, that potatoes were rubbish, that living on them would turn
our apple-cheeked, big-boned farming men and women into windy,
herring-gutted, lantern-jawed sneaks I said it, and it has come to
pass.
Raleigh. But I looked not on them save as a thing good for confec-
tions, to be baked in pies, as quinces and such fruit; and tho' you
speak but scurvily of them, let me tell you that they be marvellous
refreshing and pleasant, eaten sopped in wine, which doth take off a
coldness belonging to them when raw. Nay, they may, to give them
a better grace, be stewed with prunes.
Cobbett. What is the man talking of ? I spoke about potatoes, and
not apples. I tell you, people have sunk and sunk since potatoes were
first planted in Lancashire in 1720. And now, instead of good wheaten
bread and wholesome streaky bacon, they taste nothing but your cursed
root from year's end to year's end. But the mischief's done, and at an
| end. The potatoes are ruined, stock and seed l I won't tell you in the
outlandish gallimaufry what has done it ; but it's done, and my corn,
| Cobb ETT's corn, Indian corn—
Raleigh. I know it well. LANE brought me sundry plants thereof
from the colony, which I planted side by side with my first potatoes,
in my garden at Youghall, in Ireland.
Cobbett. Did you ? Well then, I almost forgive you the potatoes.
But my corn is coming over by ship-loads, to drive the beggarly, watery,
waxy potato out of the fields, where, please the pigs, they'll never be
seen again ; or, if seen, it will be only to please the pigs—for the la-
bourers won't touch 'em when they learn what’s good for them. So,
here's my hand, SIR WALTER RALEIGH, and I forgive you the potatoes.
Raleigh. Ah! MASTER CoBBETT, 'tis a strange world, and a change-
!
Cobbett. Yes—in the matter of potatoes. But for the rest Ifancy it
remains much the same, placemen and pensioners scrambling for the
loaves and fishes, and silencing honest men, still, I'll be bound; and
your John NY BowlesEs still talking about the “glorious constitution; ”
and your fine gentlemen still giving themselves puppy-dog airs; and a
wash of learned languages still running out of Oxford and Cambridge.
But they haven't a Political Register to tell them what asses they are.
That's a change for the worse, to be sure. However the potato blight
almost reconciles me even to that. How I wish they'd give us ghosts
leave to visit the folks up yonder I should think Westminster would
invite me to a public dinner, at which not a potato should make its
appearance.
Raleigh. And Westminster Abbey perchance afford me a monument.
Farewell, MASTER Cobb ETT.
Cobbett. Good morning. I'll go and crow over PERRY.
[Ezeunt severally.
SONNET.
I IdolisE the ladies. They are fairies
That spiritualise this earth of ours;
From heavenly hotbeds, most delightful flowers,
Or choice cream-cheeses from celestial dairies.
But learning, in its barbarous seminaries,
Gives the dear creatures many wretched hours,
And on their gossamer intellects sternly showers
Science, with all its horrid accessaries.
Now, seriously, the only things, I think,
In which young ladies should instructed be,
Are stocking-mending, love, and cookery—
Accomplishments that very soon will sink,
Since Fluxions, now, and Sanscrit conversation,
Always form part of female education.
The Joke Market.
THE market is fast recovering from the flatness that usually prevails
during the beginning of the month of November. A little was done in
Epigrams, which were quoted a shade brisker than they had been
latterly. There was a good deal of business done in repartees of the
ancy to Trafalgar coupons, or cuts at the fountains, which threw them
up a trifle. Puns were still heavy, without the italics, but the market
seems to be recovering.
A GOOD CUT.
ANoTHER new scheme has just been started, for cutting through
the Isthmus of Panama. The great difficulty is how to break the neck
of it. The great object of this contemplated short cut is to do away
with a necessity for returns.
SIGNS OF THE TIMES.
A LARGE flock of Pantaloons, two Harlequins, and a Clown, were
seen hovering about the Strand on the forenoon of the 39th ultimo.
From the early appearance of these birds of passage in London, we
may expect this year an unusually severe pantomimic season.
PLENTY OF ROOM.
THERE is a rumour that Government has purchased the monster
house at the Albert Gate, for the purpose of turning it into barracks. It
has been calculated it will accommodate 800 men.
IMPUDENT ROBBERY.
When England sees Austria running off with Cracow, and will not
trouble itself to run after the offender, we think the least it could do
would be to cry “Stop thief "

LECTURE ON TIGHT LACING.
YOU are aware, young ladies, that by means of tight
lacing, the waist of the female figure may be made
to vie with that of the wasp, and to resemble the
form of an hour-glass, or the letter X ; thus very
much improving its appearance. You have seen,
perhaps, the statue of the VENUs de Medicis ;
and you know what a fright of a figure it has, in
consequence of the model from which it was taken
: evidently never having worn a corset.
The rose, however, is never without the thorn ;

THE COMPLETE LETTER-WRITER."
SINCE the Electric Telegraph is being extended
everywhere, we think it might be laid down, like the
water and the assessed taxes, to every house. By
these means a merchant would be able to correspond
with his factors at sea-towns—a lawyer would com-
municate with his agents in the country—and a
doctor would be able to consult with his patients
without leaving his fireside. What a revolution, too,
it would create in the polite circles MRs. SMITH,
when she was giving an evening party, would “re-
quest the pleasure” of her hundred guests by
pulling the electric telegraph, and the “regrets”
and “much pleasures” would be sent to MRs.
SMITH in the same way. This plan of correspon-

afterwards for a postscript.
If this plan of Electric Telegraphs for the million
should be carried out, the Post Office will become a
sinecure, as all letter-writing would be henceforth
nothing more than a dead letter. In that case it

AN ARTIST'S STRUGGLES.
IN a case that came before one of the police magis-
trates a few days ago, one of the parties was an artist
who had entered the pit of the Victoria Theatre to
do a little business between the acts by taking like-
nesses of any of the audience. This plan of having
a portrait painter going his rounds during the inter-
vals of the performance, to take full faces or profiles,
will certainly add quite a new feature to our theatri-
cal entertainments. Perhaps it would be better, in
order to save trouble, that the artist and the fruit
seller should be the same individual. His cry would
of course be “Apples, oranges, nuts, portraits, bill of
the play.” “In the more enlightened region of the
boxes, the exclamation would be refined into “Soda
water, miniature, ginger-beer, profile, or stout 7”
There may be some difficulty in a crowded theatre
to recognise the artist, and it might, therefore, be as
well that he should be permitted to exhibit a placard
between the pieces as an advertisement to the whole
audience. Perhaps in the present violent compe-
tition between the lessees of some of the smaller
theatres, the right of having one's portrait taken
might be included in the price of admission. A
capital line could be made at the top of a Victoria
bill by the words— . .
“Three new pieces and a portrait in one night ! :
| Combined attraction. Powerful effects. Striking
likenesses. New melodrama and a profile at half-
price . " - -
If the system should be continued, we may expect
to see a row of the pit, immediately behind the stalls,
partitioned off into studios. By the aid of the chan-
delier, photographic portraits could be taken in
the gallery. This will be an excellent method of
making the drama the means of fulfilling its most
legitimate object, by showing “Vice its own image; ”
and if-the photographic process should be intro-
duced, there would be a realisation of the idea that
the theatre is the place for “holding the mirro
up to nature.” -

it to adorn the cheek, and accordingly it is transferred to the nose ; which its tint does
not adorn by any means. Within the circle of
the waist are comprised certain plaguy vessels,
whose freedom from pressure is unfortunately re-
quired. When they are subject to any obstruction,
as they are by close lacing, there is a vexatious
tendency in the ankles to swell ; and the worst is,
that a tight shoe only renders the disfigurement .
the more conspicuous.
Young ladies have also some tiresome muscles,
whose support is necessary to the spine. Their
power is destroyed—what a pity this is l—by
tight stays; and then the back assumes a curva-
ture. How grievous that one cannot be at once
| slender and straight !
Comfort must also be sacrificed to elegance ; and
the reduction of the waist occasions giddiness and
headach. This perhaps alone would be a trifle ;
but lacing involves short life : and as the con-
tracted figure suggests a resemblance to the hour-
glass, the hour-glass suggests a warning to the
contracted figure.

BY GENERAL TOM THUMB.
THE GENERAL MEETS THE GENIUS of BRITAIN AT THE PALACE,
AND DANCES HIS HORNPIPE; SINGS “YANKEE DooDLE,” AND IS
ROYALLY REWARDED.
---. HERE was nothin more said at that time
- about Gracious Majesty's goin to New
York ; but I could see she sot thinkin
on it ; and I could see now and then she
looked tenderlike at the corner of her
beautiful bright eyes at PRINCE ALBERT,
who did seem a leetle streaked—for I’ve
heerd he's not so good a sailor as a
sea-gull—jist a leetle streaked at the
notion of crossing the Atlantic. Sº

kinder like to relieve him, I thought I'd
change the conversation. Givin my
cup and sarcer to an Honor-Maid, Isot
with one knee across the tother—I
could see Gover Nor BARNUM was a
trifle ryled at this, and kept shakin
his head ind pussin up his mouth like
a rabbit's, while I kept a pattin my
right calf—not mindin him a grain. Isot, and said to the Prince—
“Royal Highness,” ses I, “anything doin at the Playhouses 2 " Well,
I could see in a minute I’d put my foot into the milk-pan. All the
Honor-Maids looked, on a sudden, as if they'd lost their week's pocket-
money.; and as for BARNUM, he lifted up his eyebrows for all the
world like the arches of Waterloo Bridge. "Well, I seed that somehow
I'd taken the wrong turnin; and therefore, being an independent
American, it wasn't for me to go back. In course, I repeated the
question. “Anything doin at the playhouses 2" ses I.
Whereupon, a Maid-of-Honor, a makin believe to cross behind me
for the kittle-holder or toasting-fork, I can't say which, ses in my
ear-"If you love me, Gen'ral, not a word about them low places.
We never think about playhouses here. If you love me"—this she
ses twice, and the words seemed to run for the first time like melted
butter over my heart—“if you love me, ax about the Opera.”
I was a leetle streaked at this, as I know’d nothin of the Opera;
and should have liked to obligate the pretty critter that looked down,
like a nosegay of flesh, upon me. Howsomever, jist as I was goin to
start something, she ses—“Hush here's the company comin.”
The door was thrown open, and the Lord-in-Waitin—him as I spoke
of, with the flower-beds worked upon his coat skirts—showed in sich
a crowd of ladies and gentlemen ; and Gracious Majesty smiled, and
curtseyed in the affablest way to every one on 'em. “Who are these
critters ?” ses I, in a whisper, to LADY Dorcas—for I'd pinched her
arm, and she'd told me her name was DoRoAs—“Who are these ?”
“They are all of 'em authors, and artists, and musicians, and players,
and philosophers, and people of that sort,” ses LADY DoRCAs. “ They
all come to see us once a week ; but then they're smuggled up the
back-stairs, and so the mob, that is, the people, you see, Gen'ral, never
know nothing of the matter.”
“Why not *" ses I. “Gracious Majesty aint ashamed of 'em, eh?’
“Not exactly ashamed,” ses LADY DoRoAs, “Still, you see, in the
station that we hold, we must keep up appearances.” Well, I was
goin to make answer; but the handsum critter looked so knowin at
me, and made sich a cherry-bob with her lips, that, I felt it—I hadn't
a word to throw at a dog.
Well, I sot for at least ten minutes, and not a soul of 'em said a
syllable to me. At last my blood began to bile, and I ses to LADY
DoRCAs, ses I–"My dander's risin. The authors and painters, and
philosophers, as you call the critters, think no more of me, than if I
was one of theirselves.”
Whereupon LADY DoRoAs smiled so, my heart opened at it, and
said, “Envy, dear Gen'ral, nothin but envy.”
Well, Gracious Majesty was smilin and talkin to all of 'em by turns,
and I thought I'd ax some of their names, that I might put down all
about theirselves and families, and make a book on it—as I’m doin—
to sell. “Who’s that good-tempered looking gen’lman,” says I,
“talking to Gracious Majesty 2 "
“That,” ses LADY DoRCAs, “is MR. Edwin LANdseer ; he's our
domestic painter. He's a great favourite here ; always paintin' some
of us, specially the lapdogs and parrots.”
Well, I guess I should have known that, if LADY DoRCAs hadn't told
me so. For there was two or three of the QUEEN's spanels, that no
sooner seed him, than they run yelping away from him ; they thought
–cunnin critters 1—he'd come for a sittin.
“Look,” ses LADY DoRCAs, and she pinted to a China cat, that
went rubbin herself aginst LANDsh ER's leg, like an old acquaintance.
“Only look at that—there's sagacity.”
“Why,” ses I, “does she want to be painted 2 The dogs, on the
contrairy, run away.”
“Very true,” ses Lady DoRoAs ; “dogs don't make good sitters;
but, I don't know how it is, cats like it. Look at that darling !”—
the China cat still a rubbin herself—“she's been in three exhibitions ;
and—I know it as well as I know my own thoughts—she's standin
on her hind legs, a begging of LANDsh:ER for a fourth full-length.”
“Who’s that ?” ses I, as a tallish, slimmish gen’leman came in, and
the QUEEN shook him by the hand very hearty. “Who’s that ?”
LADY DoRCAs lowered her voice, and putting her rosebud mouth to
my ear—I thought my heart would have beat through my busum–
she said, in a sort of solemn whisper, “That’s the imminent tragedian,
MR. MACREADY.”
Well, I'd heerd a good deal of him, and as we'd both been on the
stage, I felt a kinder sort of curiosity in him. “A very pleasin sort
of human,” ses I; “introduce him.”
“Bye-and-bye,” says LADY DoRCAs.
done with him.”
“And does MACREADY come often here 2 ” ses I.
“Bless you, Gen'ral l every week,” ses her Ladyship. “IHe comes
to read SHARspEARE to the Queen and the Prince ; but "-here
DoRCAs looked solemn agin—“you musn't say I told you ; it would
be as much as my place is worth.”
“Why not 2 " ses I.
“Why, the fact is, Gen'ral, it’s agreed in the Palace that we should
vote the English drama and English players low ; but—natur will
prevail, Gen'ral—we can't help lovin SHARspEARE, and them as plays
him best. We’ve tried to get the better on it, but we can't there-
fore, as LADY MoRGAN said here the other night, we enjoy private
drama-drinking, and keep up appearances.”
“And who is that plain-mannered, thoughtful-looking republican 7"
ses I, pintin to another.
“That,” says LADY DoRCAs, “is MR. Thost As CARLYLE. A par-
ticular friend of the Prince's. He teaches the Prince German and En-
glish from his own books, and both together. He's now in the middle
of Olirer Cromwell.”
Well, LADY DoRCAs tells 'em all off, one by one, to me; all the
authors, and painters, and genius—as she called it—of the country;
come, as they always come (but up the back-stairs, be it remembered),
once a week to a sworry with Her Gracious Majesty.
Isot a few minutes longer, when as nobody took no notice of me, I
thought I'd ryle 'em all for the night, and whittle my stick. I'd jist
given the wink to BARNUM, when Gracious Majesty comes up to me,
and, askin a thousand pardons, introduced all the company. Knowin
my place, I sot in my chair, while all the genius of Britain—as LADY
DoRCAs called 'em—was ordered to make their bow, and pass afore
me. When this was over, Gracious Majesty, with one of her own
smiles, ses—
“Gen'ral, would it be at all aginst the grain, to ask you to obleege
me and my husband, and the company, to honour us with the College
Hornpipe 2"
Well, I didn't say yes, slick. No : I thought of the model republic,
and of American independence. So I sot a minute, jist as if I was
thinkin whether I would or wouldn't. At last, when I'd wound 'em
all up to the agony pint of expectation, I ses—“I don't care if I do.
But, for fear I should slip, jist let one of the helps brush them crumbs
off the table;” for the genuises had been goin into the pound-cake
and macaroons, like lightnin into a gooseberry-bush. Sartin some of
em hadn't dined that day.
I think I’ve seen a leetle too much of life to brag, and so I won't
say nothin of my hornpipe ; only jist this, as soon as I'd done it,
Gracious Majesty ses “Charming !” And all the Maids-of-Honor
—LADY DoRCAs in special—cried softly, “What a angel !” “What
a pet !” “What a animated sugar-plum !” And then the QUEEN
unlocked a bracelet from her arm, with a little watch in it, and
Gover Non BARNUM locked it round my neck. And then didn't the
geniuses look as if they'd ground glass in their stockings—and I-I
pitied 'em.
Arter the hornpipe, I sung Yankee Doodle, whereupon PRINCE
ALBERT was so affected, that he took his four diamond studs out of
his shirt, and puttin 'em in my hand said—“Though they can add no
lustre to you, Gen'ral, your genius may impart a brilliancy to them.”
Arter that, I did the Greek Statues. And didn't some of the

FRIEND, MR. Wilkins P”
JONATHAN IN HIS GLORY.
-The Baltimore Sun contains some correspondence relative to the late
battle of Monterey, portions of which seem to have been expressly
written for quotation in our periodical. As for instance—the writer is
speaking of the “Texan Rangers”:—
“They were each armed with barrelled rifles, and, as may be supposed, did great
execution among the copper-skins.”
Copper-skins ! Quite a sporting phrase. Who would think the skins
were those of human beings 2
IIe then relates the following “incidents:"—
“Colonel M'Cluny, of Mississippi, the great duellist, got upon the brènstworks,
waved his hat, and was in the act of giving three cheers, when a ball struck him, from
the effects of which he has since died.”
Universally regretted, of course, as the “great duellist,” an honour
to his country.
“SAM url W. CHAMners, one of the rangers, or ‘the Delaware hero,” as they called
him, deliberately took aim with his “fire-shooter,’ firing with great effect, and crushing
the Mexicans.”
“But it is impossible for me to mention all the numerous incidents that occurred
at the present time.”
Let us correct what must have been an erratum in the preceding
paragraph. For “numerous” read “murderous :” such is the right
designation of the whole affair; and even JonATHAN himself must admit
“that's a fact.”
Warner Varned.
Poor MR. WARNER was to have received a large sum had his Long
Range succeeded, but this appears to have been quite out of the range
of all probability. He had long hoped for the oyster, but he has now
nothing left him but the shell.

Titº Monster Statue might be used as a breakwater before the Great

A COUNTRY CAROL.
I'm a true English farmer—no, that's not the word ;
We don't mention it now, 'tis a name never heard ;
No such people as farmers in these times there be-
Agriculturists now, mun, is what they calls we.
- Folks are growing
Far too knowing,
Much too fast for a fellow like me.
Our calling itself is no longer the same,
It has got a new nature as well as new name ;
We must all study science, we husbandmen, now,
And one need be a scollard to follow the plough.
Sent to College,
Crammed with knowledge,
Taught the wherefore, the why, and the how.
Time was when the farmer had no rule but one,
Just to do what his fathers afore him had done ;
The new-fangled inventions we now take in hand,
I, for one, must confess that I don't understand.
Weeds restraining,
Ditching, draining,
Subsoil ploughing, all over the land.
I remember the time when the stable would yield
Whatsoever was needful to fatten a field ;
But chemistry now into tillage we lugs,
And we drenches the earth with a parcel of drugs;
Makes each fallow
Physic swallow—
All we poisons, I hope, is the slugs.
Lor 1 when I was a youngster, who thought, to be sure,
Of guano, or gypsum, to use for manure ?
Of acids and salts from the blue bottle shops—
Where we soon shall be going for tinctures and drops,
Draughts and potions,
Washes, lotions,
Pills and powders, to doctor the crops. |
Well, there, to myself I says often, says I,
Things will come round again, I've no doubt, by-and-bye ;
And your wiseacres find, arter all's said and done,
That the old plan of farming, my bucks, is the one ;
Drop reliance
On their science,
Only finishing where they begun.
MISSING.—JENKINS,
For MANY YEARS EMPLOYED UPoN THE MORNING Post,
And, “as sich,” a staunch supporterof the rights of native industry, the
Church, and all our other venerable institutions—has been missing for
some weeks. Was frequently known, within the last month, to dine at

all its rigging. When last spoken with, it was quite adrift, in the
Downs. Upon leaving, there was a dead calm in Conciliation Hall, but
it was the opinion of those who are in the secret of which way the
wind blows, that a storm was rapidly brewing. There is every hope
that the brewing will be even stronger than the last.

=== SUBSc RipTION GRAND STAND
It would really seem that there is a chance of the Spanish custom of
Bull-fights being introduced into this country, for every Smithfield
market-day one or more of the noble brutes may be found giving the
public an elementary lesson in the exciting pastime. From St. Bartho-
lomew's Hospital to Blackfriars Bridge, the road is enlivened three
times a week with the playful gambols of a few bulls, and Chatham
Place furnishes a sort of amphitheatre, which only requires a stand for
spectators to give quite a Spanish air to the locality.
We recommend to the authorities that measures should be adopted for
giving to the Bull performances all the benefit they can derive from the
accessaries which are usual on similar occasions in the country where
the Bull-fight is a part of the national amusement, as we expect it will
become with us if the Smithfield arrangements are allowed to continue
as at present. We do not see why the drovers, with their sticks, should
not be at once constituted a band of picadores ; while the policemen might
be employed as torreros, with handkerchiefs affixed to the end of their
truncheons, to brandish in the eyes of the bulls, and take off the atten-
tion of the animals from any caballero who may happen to be in jeopardy.
THE UNITED GLASS AND CROCKERY
38gutante (ſtompany,
PITCHER COURT, CHINA ROAD.
This Office unites the benefit of a Mutual Association with the
security of a Proprietary Company, and offers to the Assured the
following advantages:—
To all domestics, from footmen to maids-of-all-work, an assurance
against the accidents—so frequent and so alarming in families—of
broken glass, china, crockery, and delf of every kind; from care-
lessness, ill-temper, or the mischievous habits of dog or cat.
A very trifling per centage on the rate of wages received (clear of
tea and sugar) will enable the servant assuring to break more than an
average amount of glass or crockery; whilst the feeling of independence
insured to the breaker will considerably tend to elevate him or her
in the social position.
When it is remembered that the English domestic is peculiarly liable
to those accidents of broken glass and earthenware that, for a
time, tend to ruin the peace of families, and endanger the situation
of the unfortunate servant, such a Company as the present must be
productive of the greatest good, as creating a cordial understanding
between the employer and the employed.
When, however, it is remembered that servants, covenanting to pay
for “all they break,” are more than likely to be over-charged by the
cupidity of their master, or what is more frequently the case, their
mistress, this Society will step in, and throwing its shield about the
defenceless, will fairly arbitrate the cost of the broken pieces.
To servants of eccentric or violent temper, who love to express their
independence of master or mistress by smashing a sugar-basin, or
letting drop a dozen of plates, this office will be found to offer the most
consoling advantages.
MR. GEORGE TURNER has, for many years, been incessantly occupied’
calculating the average duration of the existence of cups, saucers,
dishes, plates, decanters, tumblers, glasses, cruets, &c. &c., in every
walk of life, from Berkeley Square to Whitechapel; and is enabled,
after the most earnest and minute research into their various longevity,
to draw up such a set of tables as will enable the most independent
footman and the most careless housemaid to break to their heart's
content, at a rate of insurance inconceivably contemptible. The quar-
rels, the bickerings, the ill-blood heretofore occasioned by broken glass
or china, may henceforth be avoided ; and squabbles in the pantry,
and tears in the kitchen be for ever abolished.
To heads of families, also, this Company must be of evident value,
and in every way worthy of their countenance ; as, upon engaging a
servant, they cannot but feel doubly secure of their property, if the
domestic to be hired is duly insured in the “United Glass and
Crockery.”
To render the rates of assurance as easy as possible, servants may
insure separately for Breakfast, Dinner, or Tea-Service ; or for Lamp-
glasses only. -
JENKINS, Secretary.
The Admiralty and Somerset House-
WE beg to call attention to the deplorable want of shot in the locker
of the Board of Admiralty. Miss GREEN, the daughter of a nayal
veteran who had distinguished himself for nearly half a century in his
country's service, being left in a state of destitution, applies to its first
Lord Commissioner for relief. The answer is, virtually, “I have
nothing for you.” This is not the way in which the British tar should
respond to the appeal of a female—the daughter, too, of a messmate-
in distress. We fear that two public buildings, hitherto thought dis-
tinct, will not be confounded—the Admiralty and Somerset House.

“Mr. H. B. Chalox” to public sympathy; and now, with weeping
eyes and bleeding heart, the poor thing eats up its syllables : “MR.

“Suffered us to state that “he had ever been without reproach,” that “he had dis-

NEW FOREST, BERKSHIRE.
CERTAIN newspapers have given currency to a rumour so monstrous
that Mr. Punch, for one, cannot believe it. The report is, that the road
through Frogmore is to be stopped up, in order to be thrown, with the
surrounding property, into Windsor Home Park; and that the public
are to be similarly deprived of all roads and paths in Windsor parish
leading to Datchet Bridge, inclusive of the communication through
the Park, between Datchet and Windsor. Of course, therefore, the
Home. Park will be closed against the public altogether, no longer
affording it even the accommodation of the ditch which has been of
late years substituted for the pathway. Parliament, it is said, is to be
applied to by the Woods and Forests for authority to make these
alterations. Now, although Punch disbelieves this rumour, yet should
it possibly prove a true one, he would suggest a caution to Parliament.
The silence, perhaps, of the Windsor people will be construed
into consent to these encroachments. For silent, no doubt, the
good Windsor folks will be. Yes, and so would Mr. Punch, were he a
butcher, or grocer, or baker, or in fact anything else than what he is,
and did he live beneath the shadow of Windsor Castle. Let Parliament
remember that, before it sanctions the exclusion—not only of the inha-
bitants of Windsor, but of the people at large—from the classic ground
which surrounds HERNE's Oak, the time has gone by for turning
public property into New Forests.

SPLEND ID RUSSIAN VICTORY :
THE EMPERoR Nicholas has gained another of those tremendous
conquests that now and then cause Fame to blow her trump and
“crack her cheeks;” and make every laurel-bush throughout Christen-
dom shoot up six inches, the sap fed and fructified by human blood.
Scarcely, too, has the aforesaid Fame, like a tired trumpeter, wiped her
lips, and taken breath, tired with glorifying the victory of Nicholas–
a victory, achieved over we know not how many indomitable nuns,
headed by a veteran abbess—than we are again called upon to marvel
at the restlessness of human genius, vowed to conquest, and therefore
heedless of all impediments, overthrowing and despoiling at least eighty
unarmed Jews.
Warsaw Gazette of Nov. 6. We subjoin extracts :-
The magnificent achievement is duly set forth in the
“When EAs, our Father the Emperor having in the depths of his paternal beneficence
resolved that all his Hebrew children should shave, and lay aside their old clothes, taking

A GREAT MAN.
At the opening of the branch line from Ramsgate to Margate on
the South-Eastern Railway, which shortens the distance from London
by making one hundred and five miles out of seventy-two, the health
of MR. Cobb, the brewer, was proposed, as that of a gentleman who
“was born great, had achieved greatness, and had had greatness thrust
upon him.” It is evident that the brewer is not thought small beer
of in his own neighbourhood. We wonder that Margate is capable
of holding so great a man with his triple amount of magnitude. To
be born great is enough for some people, and to achieve greatness is
what few attempt to go beyond; but a gentleman who has beyond
all this, some more greatness thrust upon him, must really have
more to bear than he can know well what to do with. Poor MR.
CoBB must be as much embarrassed as the prize-bullocks, who always
have “greatness thrust upon them at this festive period.”
THE WELLINGTON HORSE.
THE Editor of the Literary Gazette has elected himself as Groom to'the
Horse, and, in his new function, shows himself both critical and attentive.
He thinks it a little late in the day “to pay the slightest regard to silly or
envious clamour.” To be sure, Envy has an omnivorous stomach, but
even Envy, we think, must pass by the bronze morsel, having nothing to
do with that. “The noisy scum of ribald jests,” says the Groom, gnashing
his teeth at Punch / But the invincible argument for the fixity of the

of the enterprise and the beauty with which it had been extricated from the mould. Why,
the wide universe can show nothing to compare with it; and magnitude alone has ever
been acknowledged to be an element of the sublime.”
This crushing argument scarcely allows us a leg to stand upon. We
own it—the Groom has cast down, defeated Punch / A little mistake is
a vile thing ; but a large blunder is a sublimity In the like way that

LIFE AT THE COLD BRANDY-AND-wat ER
CURE.
(From the MS. of a late Patient.)
Nothing shall convince me but that I am right in attributing to the
mistaken tenderness of a departed grandmother, a weakness of stomach
much more easily conceived than expressed. To an immoderate use of
ass's milk-and-water in my childhood, I owed a poverty of those “red
particles” that form the sanguineous fluid. In a word, up to nine-and-
twenty, I was like a flat-fish—a watery-blooded animal. My habits,
too, were recluse—ascetic. I never went to a ball, and turned from a
play-bill as from the bill of a tailor. In fine, I was a pale, shadowy,
ricketty, nerveless, nincompoop. But let the reader judge for himself.
Here are two portraits, both of myself: the one before, the other after
the cold Brandy-and-Water Cure :
Le-o-º- ------
Last autumn my disease was at its height. Even ass's-milk was too
powerful for me; and I was in such a condition of melancholy, that a
barrel organ under my window, seemed to grind my heart and brain to
powder. At this crisis, a friend of SIR. Edward Lytton Bulwer de-
tailed with generous eloquence—that is, speaking gratis—the effect
upon the Baronet of the Cold Brandy-and-Water Cure. “He had grown
too weak to wield even a goosequill; and now”—said thefriend, warm-
ing up—“he writes with a crowbar.” I immediately set out for Mal-
vern, and—but enough. The portrait of that friend hangs over m
fireplace. He is painted with a glass of Brandy-and-Waterin his hand,
with this inscription for the eyes of my children's children—“The
Guardian Spirit of the Family "
SIR. Edward Lytton Bulwer has already made known the talent
of Doctor SQUILLson, who presides at the Cold Brandy-and-Water
Tap at Malvern. I had advised the Doctor of my coming; and he,
with characteristic tenderness, was in waiting to receive me. I was
very weak, and very lame; and any other doctor might have suffered
me to hobble and blunder as I could to his residence,—but it was not
so with the Esculapian benignity of Malvern. I shall never forget it.
“It is a comfort to know,”—says SIR. Edward in his own pathetic
way—“that whoever resorts to Doctor SQUILLson will have his Cold
Brandy-and-Water strong, and plenty of it.” It must be confessed,
two great advantages to the melancholy and the ailing.
Directly I entered the house, I seemed in an atmosphere of alcohol.
I arrived at supper-time. Never shall I forget the glowing, happy
faces shone like chemists’ bottles by gaslight. The supper was com-
posed of captains' biscuits and seedy lieutenants. With these, of
course, was the eternal Brandy-and-Water, in enormous jugs and
bottles. A Captain-treated at the time for a chronic crick in the
back-had just concluded the song, “The Glasses Sparkle on the
Board,” and his wife, intimating that “that made the tenth,” was
advising the patient “not to over physic himself, but to go to bed.” He
was a very noble, but withal, a very gentle warrior, that Captain.
Dressed in petticoats, he might have passed for an elderly gentlewoman.
All the patients were led to bed at ten.
Accustomed for so many years to asses' milk, my stomach revolted
at the thoughts of Brandy. However, I was awoke at seven by the
attendant Spirit, who poured about four inches' depth of very weak
Brandy-and-Water in what is called—THE Bort
LE BATH.
He then poured about three gallons of the grog over my head; and
then, throwing a sheet about me, rubbed me very dry. The alcoholic
particles, entering the pores of my skin, produced at first an unpleasant
sensation; but quickly dressing myself, and—
before Istarted—tossing offa tumbler of Brandy-
and-Water, I was in a few minutes on my way
to the hills. Never shall I forget my sensations !
I passed a donkey on my way, and felt arenewed
contempt for asses' milk. What a new bloom
was upon the world ! I trod the earth as though
it was India-rubber—and felt the blood sing like
a nightingale in my brain! What a deep com-
passion I had for the poor wretches who swal-
lowed drugs! Obstinate victims of prejudice and
craft, who would swallow Ipecacuanha when
Nature offers Brandy-and-Water 1
On I went to the fountain of St. Cognac's
Well; a natural source, which—in honour of
the saint—pours forth the Water and the Brandy
already mixed. Took another glass—and still

Doctor SQUILLson's Brandy-and-Water? And
of this there was a supply ad libitum. The eatables, too, were the finest
Strasburg hams, tongues, Bologna sausages, and every conceivable sort
of relishing flesh and fish. Doctor SQUILLson, however, forbids peri-
winkles, as principally antagonistic to his system.
The table was full; but it is not for me, by pen or pencil, to publish
the features of my fellow-patients. It is enough to say that they all,
more or less, glowed with the benign effects of Cold Brandy-and-Water:
and that blissful exhiliration of soul—so wondrously described by SIR
Edward Lytton Bulwer—sparkled in the eyes, and bubbled from
the lips of every invalid at the table. Upon the ladies, the system
seemed to have the most felicitous effect. They chirrupped like birds
and were playful as kittens.
After breakfast, DR. SQUILLson saw all his patients individually,
prescribing for them their various baths, and the number of glasses of
Brandy-and-Water. This over, the patients played at billiards, crib-
bage; anything that called for no employment of the mind. The
least moral or intellectual employment is fatal to the Cold Brandy-
and-Water Cure. “Patients who come here,” said the benevolent
Squillson, “must forget all the ordinary cares of life; debts, duties,
responsibilities, and all that ; husbands must forget their wives-wives
their husbands; in a word, the one sole thought of the live-long day
must be Cold Brandy-and-Water.”
We dined at three, Dinner magnificent. No wine, however, allowed
—nothing but Cold Brandy-and-Water. A large bottle of each was
set for every patient, male and female. The dinner composed of every
conceivable dish calculated to sharpen the appetite. After dinner the
good Squillson allows cigars, but always with this condition—to drink
plenty of Brandy-and-Water.
(I have spoken of dinner; and here I cannot but dwell upon a
strange coincidence. “I am glad,” says a brother writer on the Cure ;
countenances of those who were to be my fellow-patients. Their ruby

dinner.”
accident sufficiently curious to chronicle it.) - -
Cigars and Brandy-and-Water over, I went out, taking a very zig-
zag stroll. Called again at St. Cognac's Well, and—to keep my
conscience clear with the Doctor—took another glass. Home at seven,
to prepare for the Sitz, or Punch-Bowl Bath, filled to a certain depth
with Čold Brandy-and-Water. It being the first time I sat in it, I was
allowed to take it with lump sugar. But this is an indulgence to
beginners only. When in the bath, a blanket is thrown over you.
With a little imagination, assisted by the fumes, and you may think
I, too, was glad upon the like principle, and I think the
yourself either upon a tripod or a duck's nest ; prophesying or
hatching. The Punch-Bowl Bath, however, is generally taken with
the hookah, which mightily soothes the sitter under the operation.
The next morning I was to have the Wet Sheet—namely, to be
wrapt in a sheet previously soaked in Cold Brandy-and-Water. (From
this practice, doubtless, comes the bacchanal phrase of “a sheet in the
wind.”) Let me, however, explain. Having stretched myself upon my
back, the sheet was rolled round and round me ; then came blankets ;
then a bed ; and then I was tucked in, and made as air-tight as NELson
in the cask of rum. This was to be “packed,” and—here I am.
Oh, for SIR Edward's pen l Oh, for the eagle plume of BULwer
For how can my goose-quill express the delights, the glories of the wet

spirituous fluid seemed to enter every pore, creep into my stomach,
and thence rise in golden clouds to my brain All kinds of musical
utterance—all lovely sights were heard, were visible. Seethed in Cold
Brandy-and-Water I seemed to flit from tavern to tavern. I can now
perfectly understand how, when witches wanted to go to their Sabbath,
they anointed themselves, and were there, at least, spiritually. In
like manner did the Cold Brandy-and-Water Sheet waſt me now to the
“Cider-Cellar”—now to the “Coal-Hole”! I heard a thousand voices cry,
“Hot with ”—“Cold without”—and saw a multitude of men, spinning
like dervishes about me—spinning with tubs of oysters 1
Cruel was the hand that, at the end of the hour, awoke me from this
bliss I Relentlessly that hand tore the blankets off, unwrapt the sheet,
and I lay smoking—screeching hot. Never, I thought, had Brandy-
and-Water smoked till then. In this state I was soused—for therein
lies the philosophy of the cure—into a bath of Cold Brandy-and-Water
—and Cold Brandy-and-Water, from a huge goblet, poured over my
head. I was then rubbed dry—drest myself—swallowed two glasses of
Cold Brandy-and-Water—two more at St. Cognac's Well—and returned,
the first time with a suspicion of a headache, to breakfast.
Nevertheless, with the Cold Brandy-and-Water Cure, these may be
taken as truths. “Debts and bills of acceptances forgotten ; a sense
of present spreeishness absorbs the past and the future ; and we feel
continually in a state to laughingly exclaim—“We won't go home till
morning.’” Indeed, in a very little time, I felt myself nothing but
Brandy-and-Water; and now and then half expected that somebody
would take a spoon, and stir me.
...From the Wet Sheet I was promoted to the Douche or Decanter Bath,
This is a fall of Brandy-and-Water of about twenty feet from a cistern
shaped like a decanter.
The great point in taking this bath is to avoid letting the Cold
Brandy-and-Water give you a blow on the head: which Cold Brandy-
and-Water is apt to do.
No sooner was I tucked in, than the
| Doctor SQUILLsoN looked at my tongue every day; and every day,
showed the increased effects of the Cold Brandy-and-Water. In six
weeks it was furred like a mole's back. But my good fortune was
most shown in what is called—“the crisis.” Now, a crisis is nothing
more or less than a large carbuncle appearing
on the nose. Here is mine. And Doctor
SQUILLsoN, with a professional vanity perfectly
natural, was very proud of it.
I have presented DR. SquillscN with a tes-
timonial—a punch-ladle, with a silver four-
penny at the bottom. I am now at home, and
never touch ass's milk. Guided, too, by the
advice of the urbane Squillson, I am enabled
to carry on the Cold Brandy-and-Water Cure
quite as well in my own house, as amid the
Alps of Malvern. In fact, I am another man. I was puny, peevish,
white-faced, melancholy. And now, I can't count my daily, nightly
glasses of Cold Brandy-and-Water. I never miss a masquerade ; and
have been three times fined at Bow Street, for persisting in the cure.
This I have done and dared—but I won't brag.
Permit me, reader, to conclude in the alcoholic words of SIR Edward.
Speaking from the Sitz, or Punch-Bowl Bath, he says, “Here, then, O
jolly brothers O right sort of chaps I bid you farewell. I wish you
one of the most blessed friendships man ever made—the familiar inti-
macy with Cold Brandy-and-Water 1"

IT has been proposed by a benevolent individual—the same, we
believe, who held the umbrella over the duck in a shower of rain—to
provide the horse of the Duke of Wellington's Statue with a nose-bag.

PANIC AMONG DANCING MASTERS.
olk A Dancing-masters have sustained a
severe loss in the death of the Polka mania;
which had been yielding, for the last two
_º years, enormous incomes to the principal
# professors of the Terpsichorean art. Some
of them had rushed into large and expen-
sive establishments on the strength of the
Polka, but the untimely end of that once
popular pas has left the Dancing-masters
involved in liabilities they are quite unable
to meet. Some of them, finding no de-
pendence to be placed on the achievements
of “the light fantastic toe,” have taken
abruptly to their heels.
The Polka market has long been declin-
ing, from the palmy days when it was
taught by a Bohemian nobleman at half a
guinea a lesson, down to the present day,
when it is to be learned anywhere, in five minutes, for half-a-crown.
The once favourite step, which was eagerly caught at on the most
extravagant terms, is now going begging at a shilling a lesson, and
such is the depression, that we may expect to see the Polka shortly
advertised to be taught, with a Cracovienne in, for ninepence. Unless
some other dance turns up as a successor to that which is now nearly
defunct, the Maitres de Danse may hop the twig at their earliest con-
venience.

BY ONE OF THEMSELVES.
CHAPTER XLI.-SNOBS AND MARRIAGE.
In that noble romance called Ten Thousand a Year, I remember a
profoundly pathetic description of the hero, MR. AUBREY's, Christian
manner of bearing his misfortunes. After making a display of the
most florid and grandiloquent resignation, and quitting his country
mansion, the delightful writer supposes AUBREY to come to town in a
post-chaise and pair sitting bodkin probably between his wife and
sister. It is at about seven o'clock, carriages are rattling about,
knockers are thundering, and tears bedim the fine eyes of KATE and
MRs. AUBREY as they think that in happier times at this hour—their
AUBREY used formerly to go out to dinner to the houses of the
aristocracy his friends. This is the gist of the passage—the elegant
words I forget. But the noble, noble sentiment I shall always cherish
and remember. What can be more sublime than the notion of a great
man's relatives in tears about—his dinner P With a few unconscious
touches, what author ever so happily described A SNoB 2
We were reading the passage lately at the house of my friend,
RAYMond GRAY, Esquire, Barrister-at-Law, an ingenuous youth with-
out the least practice, but who has luckily a great share of good spirits,
which enables him to bide his time, and bear laughingly his humble
position in the world. Meanwhile, until it is altered, the stern laws
of necessity and the expenses of the Northern Circuit oblige MR. GRAY
to live in a very tiny mansion in a very queer small square in the
airy neighbourhood of Gray's Inn.
What is the more remarkable, is, that GRAY has a wife there. MRs.
GRAY was a Miss HARLEY BAKER : and I suppose I need not say
that is a respectable family. Allied to the CAvendishes, the Oxfords,
the MARRYBONES, they still, though rather déchus from their original
splendour, hold their heads as high as any. MRs. HARLEY BAKER, I
know, never goes to church without John behind to carry her prayer-
book ; nor will Miss WELBEck, her sister, walk twenty yards a shop-
ping without the protection of FIGBY, her sugar-loaf page; though
the old lady is as ugly as any woman in the parish, and as tall and
whiskery as a Grenadier. The astonishment is, how EMILY HARLEY
BAKER could have stooped to marry RAYMond GRAY. She, who was
the prettiest and proudest of the family; she, who refused SIR CockLE
BYLEs, of the Bengal Service ; she, who turned up her little nose at
Essex TEMPLE, Q.C., and connected with the noble house of Albyn ;
she, who had but 4000 pour tout potage, to marry a man who had
scarcely as much more. A scream of wrath and indignation was
uttered by the whole family when they heard of this mésalliance
MRs. HARLEY BAKER never speaks of her daughter now but with tears
in her eyes, and as a ruined creature. Miss WELBEck says, “I con-
sider that man a villain ; ”–and has denounced poor good-natured
Mrs. PERKINs as a swindler, at whose ball the young people met for
the first time.
MR. and MRs. GRAY, meanwhile, live in Gray's Inn Lane, aforesaid,
with a maid-servant and a nurse, whose hands are very full, and in a
most provoking and unnatural state of happiness. They have never
once thought of crying about their dinner, like the wretchedly puling
and Snobbish womankind of my favourite Snob AUBREY, of Ten Thou-
sand a Year; but on the contrary, accept such humble victuals as
Fate awards them with a most perfect and thankful good grace—may,
actually have a portion for a hungry friend at times—as the present
writer can gratefully testify.
I was mentioning these dinners, and some admirable lemon puddings
which MRs. GRAY makes, to our mutual friend the great MR. GoLD-
MoRE, the East India Director, when that gentleman's face assumed
an expression of almost apoplectic terror, and he gasped out, “What
Do they give dinners ?” He seemed to think it a crime and a wonder
that such people should dine at all ; or that it was their custom to
huddle round their kitchen fire over a bone and a crust. Whenever
he meets them in society, it is a matter of wonder to him (and he
always expresses his surprise very loud) how the lady can appear
decently dressed, and the man have an unpatched coat to his back.
I have heard him enlarge upon this poverty before the whole room at
the Conflagrative Club, to which he and I and GRAY have the honour
to belong.
We meet at the Club on most days. At half-past four, GoLDMoRE
arrives in St. James's Street, from the City, and you may see him
reading the evening papers in the bow window of the Club which
enfilades Pall Mall—a large plethoric man, with a bunch of seals in a
large bow-windowed light waistcoat. He has large coat-tails, stuffed
with agents' letters and papers about companies of which he is a
Director. His seals jingle as he walks. I wish I had such a man
for an uncle, and that he himself were childless. I would love and
cherish him, and be kind to him.
At six o'clock in the full season, when all the world is in St. James's
Street, and the carriages are cutting in and out among the cabs on
the stand, and the tufted dandies are showing their listless faces out
their heads to each other through the plate-glass windows of
ARTHUR's : and the red-coats wish to be Briarean, so as to hold all
the gentlemen's horses ; and that wonderful red-coated royal porter is
sunning himself before Marlborough House, at the noon of London
time : you see a light-yellow carriage with black horses, and a coach-
man in a tight floss-silk wig, and two footmen in powder and white
and yellow liveries, and a large woman inside in shot silk, a poodle,
and a pink parasol, which drives up to the gate of the Conflagrative,
and the page goes and says to MR. GoLDMoRE (who is perfectly aware
of the fact, as he is looking out of the windows with about forty other
Conflagrative bucks) “Your carriage, Sir.” G. wags his head.
“Remember, eight o'clock precisely,” says he to MULLIGATAwNEY, the
other East India Director, and ascending the carriage, plumps down
by the side of MRs. GoldMoRE for a drive in the Park, and then
home to Portland Place. As the carriage whirls off, all the young
bucks in the Club feel a secret elation. It is a part of their establish-
ment as it were. That carriage belongs to their Club, and their Club
belongs to them. They follow the equipage with interest ; they eye
it knowingly as they see it in the Park. But halt 1 we are not come
to the Club SNoBs yet. O my brave Snobs, what a flurry there will
be among you when those papers appear!”
... Well, you may judge, from the above description, what sort of a
man GoldMoRE is. A dull and pompous Leadenhall Street Choesus,
good-natured withal, and affable—cruelly affable. “MR. GoLDMoRE
can never forget,” his lady used to say, “that it was MRs. GRAY's
grandfather who sent him to India ; and though that young woman
has made the most imprudent marriage in the world, and has left her
man, and we shall do everything in our power to be of use to him.”
So they used to ask the GRAYs to dinner twice or thrice in a season,
when, by way of increasing the kindness, BUFF, the butler, is ordered
to hire a fly to convey them to and from Portland Place.
Of course I am much too good-natured a friend of both parties not to
tell GRAY of GoLDMoRE's opinion regarding him, and the Nabob's asto-
nishment at the idea of the briefless barrister having any dinner at all.
Indeed, GoldMoRE's saying became a joke against GRAY amongst us
a thousand other mad pranks with him in our facetious way.
One day, then, coming home from the Club, MR. GRAY conveyed to

his wife the astounding information that he had asked GoLDMoRE to
dinner.
“My love,” says MRs. GRAY, in a tremor, “how could you be so
cruel ? Why, the dining-room won't hold MRs. GoLDMoRE.”
“Make your mind easy, MRs. GRAY ; her ladyship is in Paris. It
is only CROEsus that’s coming, and we are going to the play after-
wards—to Sadlers' Wells. GoldMoRE said at the Club that he
thought SHAKSPEARE was a great dramatic poet, and ought to be
patronised ; whereupon, fired with enthusiasm, I invited him to our
banquet.”
“Goodness gracious ! what can we give him for dinner ? He has
two French cooks ; you know MRs. GoLDMoRE is always telling us
about them ; and he dines with Aldermen every day.”
*** A plain leg of mutton, my Lucy,
I prythee get ready at three ;
Have it tender, and smoking, and juicy,
And what better meat can there be z'"
says GRAy, quoting my favourite poet.
“But the cook is ill ; and you know that horrible PATTYPAN, the
pastrycook’s ” * *
“Silence, Frau !” says GRAY, in a deep-tragedy voice. “I will
have the ordaining of this repast. Do all things as I bid thee. Invite
our friend SNoB here to partake of the feast. Be mine the task of
procuring it.”
“Don’t be expensive, RAYMoND,” says his wife.
“Peace, thou timid partner of the briefless one. GoldMoRE's
dinner shall be suited to our narrow means. Only do thou do in all
things my commands.” And seeing, by the peculiar expression of the
rogue's countenance, that some mad waggery was in preparation, I
awaited the morrow with anxiety.
THE ARISTOCRACY OF HAIR CUTTING.
A BARBER in Bishopsgate, who undertakes to cut the hair of
his customers in a Saloon representing the Bay of Naples, and professes
to lather them into a belief that they are actually looking upon Mount
Vesuvius, has carried his love of illusion so far as to have puffed him-
self into the belief that the public will be attracted to his establishment
by such an announcement as the following :—
“Gentlemen may have their hair kept in the nicest order on terms in some cases at or
under what is charged by the sixpenny cheap shops, where they have the chance of
sitting down after some journeyman mechanic, and of obtaining more things than are
dreamt of in your philosophy, Horatio; or of being waited upon by some drunken half.
day man, whom no respectable master would employ.”
The insinuation thrown out against journeymen mechanics, and the
genteel horror expressed at the mere risk of sitting down after one of
the industrious classes, will have their weight with us, for as we know
of no undoubted distinction by which a journeyman mechanic may be
at once discovered, we shall certainly abstain from visiting these adver-
tising barbers, lest they might mistake us for one of the class carrying
about with them the pollution of industry. It would be awkward
to be called upon for one's credentials of gentility by the fellow who is
about to cut one's hair at this ursine menagerie.
THE SRATING SEASON.
TheRE was a deal of skating in Baker Street last week. Several
new pas were executed in the most masterly manner by the monster
beasts wending their slippery way to their dulce domum, the Baker
Street, Bazaar. We noticed an ox who was throwing his whole body
into the performance of a figure eight; and there was a great boar
from Hampshire, who did a spread eagle in the middle of the road, in
the cleanest manner. The Durham cows were less successful, having
greater difficulty to keep upon their legs, but a pastorale was got up in
Portman Square, by a party of four, who went up the middle and down
again, executing the last step more than once, and changed sides, and
balancezed with a rapidity and aplomb that delighted a large circle of
beholders. The skating was wound up with a grande ronde of all the
animals on the ice. Refreshments, consisting of bran and oilcake,
were served out in the course of the evening to the wearied skaters.

------
FANCY PORTRAIT OF THE POET TAYLOR.
It is a refreshing sign of the times that Poetry is beginning to force
its way into the business of everyday life, and our advertisers are con-
tinually cultivating the Nine, in the hope of attracting the million.
Among the most distinguished mercantile votaries of the muse, is the
celebrated J. TAYLoſt, of Lombard Street, whose lyrics on piscatorial
prices rank him with some of the best poets of our own—or anybody
else's—era. If his verses do not become immortal, it is because they
are “too good to live ; ” but we will at least preserve from oblivion the
following:—
F I S H.—
Breathes there a man, so dainty fed,
That can refuse a good Cod's head
And shoulders, weight, nine or ten pound,
Plenty of liver and full of sound 7
Let that man sulk—yes, let him frown,
Who refuses it for half-a-crown'
We regret that the above delightful distich should lose its poetical
feeling by concluding with a common-place reference to the prices of
ordinary fish, and observations on their weight, as if they were so much
mere food ; instead of being, as TAYLOR has made them, the sources—
aye, the fish-sources—of inspiration. As the poet does not seem to
have come quite up to the delicate niceties of his art, we suggest the
following improved mode of putting the sentiment in the above
stanza :-
When round the busy world we scan,
And learn each human wish,
We surely never find the man
Who'd dine without his fish.
Though some may praise the tender sole,
Or choose the brill instead—
They may be right, but, on the whole,
Give ME my prime cod's head 1
With parsley garnished gaily round,
And laid on china dish ;
Complete, with liver and with sound,-
Sure 'tis the king of fish.
And if you would enjoy the treat,
Rush with your money down ;
TAYLOR, of far-famed Lombard Street,
Sells it for half-a-crown.

THE PROMENADE CONCERT MANIA.
RoMENADE concerts will soon be
all over London. There is
scarcely a building sufficiently
large that is not destined, accord-
ing to rumour, for these perform-
ances. It is said that M. JULLIEN
is to have the Pantheon, and that
the stalls will all be converted
into private boxes. The National
Baths in Holborn are decidedly to
have the New-River water turned
off, and the tide of public pa-
tronage turned on, in the hope
of obtaining a series of profitable
overflows. The orchestra will be
stationed in the middle of the
great tank, and the conductor,
who will be surrounded by his
Companions of the Bath, will no
doubt go on swimmingly. The
dressing rooms will be converted
into boxes, and unless the specu-
lation should receive an unex-
pected damp, there is every
probability of its proving suc-
cessful. On the opening night,
“Turn on, Old Time” will be
played, with Old Time disguised
as a turncock ; but instead of turning on he will be turning off the liquid element. During
the summer months we daresay we shall have the “Deep deep Sea, Quadrille” with
real water.
We have heard a rumour, but cannot vouch for its truth, that the Bishop of LoNDoN
intends to apply for a music license for St. Paul's, in order that he may be enabled to
compete with the attractions offered at other exhibitions. If he could announce a
“Magnificent Addition : " with “No Advance of Prices !” the effect would be very great at
the Christmas Holidays.
THE SCARCITY OF EGGS.
SEVERAL of the London papers have been
commenting in terms of sober sadness on the
present scarcity of eggs. We understand the
dearth has been occasioned by the extent to
which the Terpsichorean efforts of BARoN NA-
THAN were carried last summer, and to the nu-
merous imitations of his celebrated Egg Craco-
vienne. Though the Baron so contrives that he
dances the pas blindfold without causing a single
egg to shell out, his pupils and imitators have
not arrived at the same proficiency. NATHAN
would never harm a feather of the head of the
incipient chicken if he were to dance blindfold
among a row of nests; but the clumsy heels of
the plagiarists have committed assault and bat-
tery on the eggs, to a tune that is truly terrible.
We understand, however, that to make up the
deficiency in eggs, which are so scarce and yet so
desirable, a Treasury order will be issued to
throw open all the mare's nests in the United
I(ingdom.
A PLeA IN BAR.
A toll-TAKER has been charged with em-
bezzlement at Waterloo Bridge, where the traffic
has been temptingly great since the closing of
Westminster. Poor fellow ! Some allowance
ought really to be made for the novelty of his
situation.

3. Cure for a National ſtilalabp.
An Englishman's love of mischief is proverbial; for it is well known
that he cannot visit any object of interest, abroad or at home, without
carrying off a memorial of the occasion in the shape of a piece of the
precious relic, whatever it may be, or cutting his initials in some con-
spicuous part of it. We know a gentleman who wears a brick of the
Colosseum as a brooch, and has got a table inlaid with marble,
smugged from the ruins of Pompeii. Every one knows that John
SMITH has sent his name down, or rather up to posterity, by chiselling
it on the top of the Pyramids; and the toe of St. Peter, at Rome, though
reported to have been kissed away, has no doubt been filed off from
time to time for the sake of the dust by some of our countrymen. It
seems as if they could not look at a venerable relic without having an
irresistible desire to have a cut at it. The sight of the most ancient
marble raises less a feeling of admiration than of a desire to have “a
chip of the old block” to carry away in one's pocket.
In order to cure this injurious propensity, it has been proposed that
a block of wood and a knife should be suspended before or at the side
of every object of art, so that the lookers on may have something to
cut, without doing any damage to the sculpture, architecture, or paint-
ing, as the case may be, that would otherwise fall a victim to that
hacking attack which ends at last in total consumption. The words
“Please to cut this Block” should be written over, as in the annexed
illustration.
NAMES OF STREETS.
A sufrenzR lately supplied to the Times a heart-rending account of
his pursuit of a dinner through difficulties. He was invited to dine
with a newly-married friend (newly-married men are sometimes per-
mitted to invite acquaintances), at a certain Glo'ster Terrace, which—
beguiled by a similarity of name—he sought from Regent's to Hyde
Park ; at last arriving at the Terrace required in such a state of
exhaustion that he was carried into the dining-room by two footmen,
and after much difficulty and considerable attention was restored by
the application of sundry plates of hot soup to his stomach. The
sufferer, of course, loudly calls for a “remedy of the present system of
street nomenclature.” Why should there not be a registrar of streets
as of births 2 Why should not bricks and mortar be duly christened
by an appointed authority, the Beadle of the Parish and the senior
Pew-opener standing sponsors 2
The Punch Projectile.
MR. PUNCH is very sorry to hear that CAPTAIN WARNER's Long
Range has failed. To console the Government for this disappointment,
MR. P. will engage, on reasonable terms, to compose a squib which
shall strike the enemies of his country at any distance.
Notice –If the WELLINGTON Statue, which was left on the top of
the triumphal arch in Piccadilly, about two months ago, is not taken
away by the 21st of this month, it will be sold to defray expences.
TOUCHING INCIDENT.
ON the QUEEN's visit to Arundel Castle, the chair of recognition
used at the Coronation and presented to the DUKE of Norfolk, was
shown to Her Majesty, who honoured the chair with a further recog-
nition by recognising it as an old acquaintance. We understand the
meeting was rather affecting. The QUEEN no sooner saw the chair,
than she threw herself into the arms of her old friend, and declared
that she could repose with confidence on its tried integrity. The chair
in conformity with the usual etiquette, remained standing during the
whole of the time that Her Majesty continued seated. During the
interview, the air of the “Old Arm Chair” was whistled by one of the
Lords-in-Waiting. Her Majesty on quitting, took the veteran kindly
by both arms, and playfully exclaiming—“Adieu, ma chère,” quitted
the apartment.
BLUNDERBUSS IRELAND.
A LETTER from Virginia (county Cavan) speaks of a public sale
by auction of muskets and bayonets; an Enniskillen paper has also a
sort of price current for guns and pistols. The Free Press, speaking
of the south, says “there is more business doing in the trade in guns,
pistols, and blunderbusses, than in any other in this town.”
ham pants at its stithy, and cannot sufficiently supply weapons to
famishing Ireland ; one proof that Ireland has a very ostrich-like
stomach ; and wanting food, can make a very dainty meal off iron.
We think we shall commission our artist to execute a fancy portrait
of starving Erin swallowing, like an Indian juggler, knives by the
dozen: and caring not to lay her money out upon necessary bread
and potatoes, enjoying the luxury of gunpowder and, a la Chinois,
dishes of slugs.
Matrimonial rºarket.
WE understand that in consequence of the flatness which prevailed
last year in the matrimonial market, occasioned by the speculations in
railways, the stock on hand of unmarried ladies is much larger this
year than usual. To meet the circumstances of this unexpected glut,
it has, we hear, been determined to sell off the entire last year's stock,
among which will be found several unredeemed pledges. All the
old goods will be offered first ; but to give a few attractive features
to the sale, there will be introduced a portion of the novelties of
last season.
slightest reserve on this interesting occasion.
IMPERIAL MAGNANIMITY.
The Post Ampt Gazette, Frankfort paper, says—
“The Emperon Nicholas has shown much disinterestedness in the Polish question-
One of his Ministers said to the Austrian Government—"The Emperor gives you a carte
blanche as regards Cracow; do what you please.’”
This is touching. Imagine JonAthAN WILD saying to BLUESRIN–
“There is the ouse; and there the swag. As for the master and missus,
the kids and the slaveys, why you may tie 'em all to the bed-postes, or
cut their precious throats, or blow their brains out. It shan't be said
that JonATHAN WILD can't be disinterested. No, BLUESRIN, and so I
gives you—a carte blanche /*
TTo more Autographs.
If the Electric Telegraph comes into general use, as we hope it will,
for we hate writing letters, there will be an end to the nuisance, to
which celebrities, like ourselves and the Duke of WELLINgtoN, are
subjected, of having to write our name fifty times a day to fill young
ladies' albums and curiosity-collectors' portfolios. Autographs will
certainly never be able to survive the shock of the Electric Telegraph :
but we suppose some other tax on greatness will be levied in its stead.
We should not at all wonder that the next demand on a genius will be
to send some unknown admirer, “who hopes you will excuse the
liberty,” your photographic portrait. We should not mind this so
much, as it is always our wish to do a thing handsomely.
AN APOLOGY.
The Austrian Government calls the act of taking Cracow an “incor-
poration.” For the future, thieves should say when they are taken up
for stealing a pocket-handkerchief, “Why, my lord, I merely incorpo-
rated it.”

THE SNOBS OF ENGLAND.
BY ONE OF THEMSELVES.
CHAPTER XLIT-SNOBS AND MARRIAGE.
PUNCTUAL to the hour—(By the way, I cannot omit here to mark
down my hatred, scorn, and indignation, towards those miserable Snobs
who come to dinner at nine, when they are asked at eight, in order
| to make a sensation in the company. May the loathing of honest
folks, the back-biting of others, the curses of cooks, pursue these
wretches, and avenge the society on which they trample !)—Punctual,
I say, to the hour of five, which MR. and MRs. RAYMond GRAY had
appointed, a youth of an elegant appearance, in a neat evening dress,
whose trim whiskers indicated neatness, whose light step denoted ac-
tivity, (for in sooth he was hungry, and always is at the dinner
hour, whatsoever that hour may be), and whose rich golden hair,
curling down his shoulders, was set off by a perfectly new four-and-
ninepenny silk hat, was seen wending his way down Bittlestone Street,
Bittlestone Square, Gray's Inn. The person in question, I need not
say, was MR. SNoB. He is never late when invited to dine. But to
proceed with my narrative :—
Although MR. SNoB may have flattered himself that he made a
sensation as he strutted down Bittlestone Street with his richly gilt-
knobbed cane, (and indeed I vow I saw heads looking at me from
Miss SQUILSBY's, the brass-plated milliner opposite RAYMond GRAY's,
who has three silver-paper bonnets, and two fly-blown French prints
of fashion in the window), yet what was the emotion produced by
my arrival, compared to that with which the little street thrilled,
when at five minutes past five the floss-wigged coachman, the yellow
hammer-cloth and flunkies, the black horses and blazing silver harness
of MR. GoldMoRE whirled down the street ! It is a very little street
of very little houses, most of them with very large brass plates like
Miss SQUILSBY's. Coal-merchants, architects, and surveyors, two
surgeons, a solicitor, a dancing-master, and of course several house-
agents, occupy the houses—little two-storied edifices with little stucco
porticoes. GoLDMoRE's carriage overtopped the roofs almost ; the
first floors might shake hands with CROEsus as he lolled inside; all
the windows of those first floors thronged with children and women in
a twinkling. There was MRs. HAMMERLY in curl-papers ; MRs. SAxBY
with her front awry; Mr. WHIGGLEs peering through the gauze
curtains, holding the while his hot glass of rum-and-water—in fine, a
tremendous commotion in Bittlestone Street, as the GoLDMoRE
carriage drove up to MR. RAYMond GRAY's door.
“How kind it is of him to come with both the footmen " says little
MRs. GRAY, peeping at the vehicle too. The hugest domestic, descend-
ing from his perch, gave a rap at the door which almost drove in the
building. All the heads were out ; the sun was shining; the very
organ-boy paused ; the footman, the coach, and GoldMoRE's red face
and white waistcoat were blazing in splendour. The herculean plushed
one went back to open the carriage-door.
RAYMond GRAY opened his—in his shirt-sleeves.
He ran up to the carriage. “Come in, GoLDMoRE,” says he. “Just
in time, my boy. Open the door, WHATDYECALLUM, and let your
master out,”*—and WHATDYEcALLUM obeyed mechanically, with a face
of wonder and horror, only to be equalled by the look of stupified
astonishment which ornamented the purple countenance of his master.
“Wawt taim will you please have the cage, Sir,” says WHATDYE-
CALLUM, in that peculiar, unspellable, inimitable, flunkyfied pronun-
ciation which forms one of the chief charms of existence.
“Best have it to the theatre, at night,” GRAY exclaims ; “it is but
a step from here to the Wells, and we can walk there. I've got
tickets for all. Be at Sadler's Wells at eleven.”
“Yes, at eleven,” exclaims GoLDMoRE perturbedly, and walks with
a flurried step into the house, as if he were going to execution (as
indeed he was, with that wicked GRAY as a JACK KETCH over him).
The carriage drove away, followed by numberless eyes from door-steps
and balconies; its appearance is still a wonder in Bittlestone Street.
“Go in there, and amuse yourself with SNoB,” says GRAY, opening
the little drawing-room door. “I’ll call out as soon as the chops are
ready. FANNY's below, seeing to the pudding.”
“Gracious marcy l’” says GoldMoRE to me, quite confidentially,
“How could he ask us 2 I really had no idea of this—this utter
destitution.”
“Dinner, dinner l’ roars out GRAY, from the dining-room, whence
issued a great smoking and frying; and entering that apartment we find
MRs. GRAY ready to receive us, and looking perfectly like a Princess
who, by some accident, had a bowl of potatoes in her hand, which
vegetables she placed on the table. Her husband was meanwhile
cooking mutton-chops on a gridiron over the fire.
“FANNY has made the roly-poly pudding,” says he “the chops are
my part. Here's a fine one ; try this, GoLDMoRE.” And he popped

exclamation can describe the nabob's astonishment 2
The table-cloth was a very old one, darned in a score of places.
There was mustard in a tea-cup, a silver fork for GoLDMoRE—all ours
were iron.
| “I wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth,” says GRAY,
| gravely. “That fork is the only one we have. FANNY has it
generally.”
“RAYMoND !” cries MRs. GRAY, in an imploring face.
“She was used to better things, you know ; and I hope one day to
get her a dinner service. I’m told the electro-plate is uncommonly
good. Where the deuce is that boy with the beer ? And now,” said
he, springing up, “’ I’ll be a gentleman.” And so he put on his coat,
and sate down quite gravely, with four fresh mutton chops which he
had by this time broiled.
“We don't have meat every day, MR. GoLDMoRE,” he continued,
“and it's a treat to me to get a dinner like this. You little know,
you gentlemen of England, who live at home at ease, what hardships
briefless barristers endure.”
| “Gracious marcy " says MR. GoLDMoRE.
| “Where's the half-and half FANNY, go over to the Keys’ and
get the beer. Here's sixpence.” And what was our astonishment
when FANNY got up as if to go
“Gracious marcy let me,” cries GoLDMoRE.
“Not for worlds, my dear sir. She's used to it. They wouldn't
serve you as well as they serve her. Leave her alone. Law bless
you !” RAYMond said, with astounding composure. And MRs. GRAY
left the room, and actually came back with a tray on which there was
a pewter flagon of beer. Little Polly (to whom, at her christening, I
had the honour of presenting a silver mug, ex officio) followed with a
| couple of tobacco pipes, and the queerest roguish look in her round
little chubby face.
“Did you speak to TAPLING about the gin, FANNY, my dear?”
GRAY asked, after bidding Polly put the pipes on the chimney-piece,
which that little person had some difficulty in reaching—“The last
was turpentine, and even your brewing didn't make good punch of it.”
“You would hardly suspect, GoldMoRE, that my wife, a HARLEY
BAKER, would ever make gin punch * I think my mother-in-law
would commit suicide if she saw her.”
“Don’t be always laughing at Mamma, RAYMond,” says MRs. GRAY.
“Well, well, she wouldn't die, and I don't wish she would.

how his wife could toss pancakes ; and what parts of his dress she

who had brought the beer from the public house, which MRs. FANNY

MRs. GRAY had retired, and we were sitting ruminating rather silently
over the last glasses of the port, GRAY suddenly breaks the silence by
slapping GoldMoRE on the shoulder, and saying “Now, GoLDMoRE,
tell me something.”
“What ?” asks CROESUs.
“Haven't you had a good dinner ?” |
GoldMoRE started, as if a sudden truth had just dawned upon him.
He had had a good dinner; and didn't know it until then. The three
mutton-chops consumed by him were best of the mutton kind; the
potatoes were perfect of their order; as for the roly-poly, it was too
complimented MR. GRAY, who was in the case, on his curious and
good. The porter was frothing and cool, and the port wine was
worthy of the gills of a bishop. I speak with ulterior views; forthere
is more in GRAY's cellar.
“Well,” says GoldMoRE, after a pause, during which he took time
to consider the momentous question GRAY put to him—“’Bon my

this the time came for the play, and we went to see MR. PHELPs at
Sadler's Wells. -
The best of this story (for the truth of every word of which I
pledge my honour) is, that after this banquet, which GoLDMoRE
enjoyed so, the honest fellow felt a prodigious compassion and regard
for the starving and miserable giver of the feast, and determined to
help him in his profession. And being a Director of the newly
established Antibilious Life Assurance Company, he has had GRAY

Whether he knows Sanscrit or not, I can't say ; but GoLDMoRE

And we freely came down with the dust, did we not ?

To relieve you we pinch'd our own indigent sons;
You gained your petition—to buy ammunition,
Pikes and cutlasses, bayonets, pistols, and guns.

holes, but, considering the number of cavities at every step, we must
say that Westminster Bridge has been opened weeks ago, in the most
liberal manner. No other bridge on the Thames can boast of so fine
an opening. It stands by itself, and, considering the obstinacy with
which it resists all improvements, its motto should be, “Open to all,
and influenced by none.”

We shudder at the notion of an omnibus

INsolvency has long been associated with the name of Portugal,
from the Court of the former being situated in the street of the latter.
Now that the Portuguese are in a state of bankruptcy, the location of
the Insolvent Court in Portugal Street appears singularly appropriate.

STATE OF COVENT
º
This splendid temple of the drama presents at this moment a melan-
choly spectacle of fallen greatness. All the glories of former years are
thrown together in an inclosed space, level with the grand portico.
The properties, of the most gorgeous description, have been shot in a
heap, as so much rubbish. King John's sceptre has got, by some strange
chance, into the mouth of the Bronze Horse, and the crown of Richard
the Third has fallen on to the head of Friar Bacon. “Chaos has come
again,” in all its pristine purity. Othello's lamp is in the hands of Guy
GARDEN THEATRE.
Fawkes, Prospero's wand is sticking in the eye of Bluebeard's elephant,
and the goblet from which Macbeth used to drink health to Banquo is
smashed up with the cauldron of the witches. The whole aspect of the
theatre affords much room for the reflections of the philosopher; and
not the least suggestive point to the sage is the Haymarket bill of the
clever comedy of Look before you Leap, on the hoarding, which may be
studied with quite as much profit by those inside as those on the out-
side of the building.
THE VAUXHALL HERMIT.
A PARAGRAPH has been going the round of the papers, announcing
the death of an imaginary personage, the Vauxhall Hermit. He cer-
tainly must have died of utter inanition, if he has died at all, for his
thinness was so extreme as to render him nothing better than a trans-
parency. It is true that during the Vauxhall season there used to be
“a light in his laughing eye” from nine o'clock till twelve ; but the lu-
minous appearance was attributable to a rushlight, over which a lid
was cleverly put to protect it from the elements. We have, on more
than one occasion seen the “gentle Hermit’s” eyes blown out by a sud-
den gust of old Boreas. We shall be hearing next of the death of Gog
or Magog, and of the length of time they were stationed in Guildhall
as watchmen.
We have inquired at Vauxhall Gardens, as to the truth of the report of
the Hermit's decease, but we are happy to say that there is no foundation
for the rumour. When last seen, the Hermit was sitting in his usual
position; and though his cheeks were colourless, a little red lead will put
upon him the usual “roseate hue of health,” in a dab or two of the six-
pound paint-brush. His frame is said to be somewhat shattered, but
by attention to his board, and strengthening his profile, this temporary
defect will be speedily remedied. The Hermit's cat might be, as the
French say, un peu mieux, but she will be looked to at the proper period.
Metropolitan Sites.
LoRD MoRPETH, with his characteristic liberality, intends opening
an Office for Statues out of place. A list of situations will always be
kept for reference, and vacancies made public as soon as they occur.
Every facility will be given to philanthropists wishing to erect their
own statues.
LEARNED MUSICAL CRITICS.
OUR musical critics are getting so learned that we don't know how
to follow them. They will tell us every key in which every piece is
written, which is all very clever on their parts ; but they sadly perplex
us by the odd names they give to things we only know under more
familiar titles. They will talk to us of a delicious scherzo, a beautiful
bit of pedalling for the horn, and a nice phrase of contrapuntism,
while they will inform us that there is a luscious passage for the
wood, when they mean there is something pretty for flutes, flageolets,
or oboes. There are now so many nice divisions of wood, wind, brass,
string, and steel, that we shall expect to hear next of a fine morceau of
fugue for the parchment, by which, of course, will be understood, the
tambourines, grosses caisses, and kettle-drums. We shall hear probably of
a lovely bit of scholarly writing for the steel, in allusion to a few notes
given to the triangle. We have no doubt this is all very learned, and
we have great respect for learning, but we like the intelligible as well
when it is convenient.
Extraordinary Longevity.
MR. ANTHoNY DIBBs has in his possession a joke which has lived for
the last ten years. . It has appeared in several magazines, run the
round of all the periodicals, and been fêted at the principal dinner-
tables of the metropolis, besides being a very great favourite for innu-
merable seasons at the Circus at Astley's. The last time it appeared
in public, was in a burlesque. It was dreadfully exhausted at the
time, but still it has survived the blow. It made an attempt to come
out on Christmas Day, at an evening party, but was so very weak
that it was obliged to retire, the moment after. It is living at present
in the greatest privacy with MR, ANTHONY DIBBs.

ROYAL DISINTERESTEDNESS.
A very amusing letter has been printed, from DUKE D’Assis to the
Count DE MonTEMoLIN, in which the former tries to persuade the latter
to marry the royal lady, who is now the wife of the writer of the
epistle. We congratulate the husband on the promptitude with which
he got up his affection in time to meet the wishes of his country, and
was prepared to centre his happiness, at a few weeks' notice, on a fair
object he had so lately most earnestly recommended as the wife of
another. The Duke, however, hints that if his beloved cousin will not
take the lady, and cement his own and the nation's happiness, he, the
Duke, must go through that operation. If ever there was a choice that
decidedly deserved the name of Hobson's, it is this of the DUKE D’Assis
in his thus amiably taking the partner declined by the Count DE
MonTEMoLIN. The whole transaction is a precious piece of satire on
royal marriages. We are afraid Heaven only makes the common ones,
and that royal marriages are the work of some other manufactory.

THIs remnant of the dark ages still exists in many lodging-houses,

THE WAR
IN the course of this campaign, the chief difficulty has not been to
oppose the troops, but to defend positions against those disagreeable
enemies and expert tacticians, the wild beasts. It is bad enough to be
obliged to hold out against the assaults of a file of soldiers, but it is
terrible to be compelled to resist a furious cohort of alligators, each of
whom has an entire file in his tongue, and a double column of teeth that
would make the oldest soldier admit that, in spite of all his manoeu-
vreing, they saw through him. The bears form of themselves a squad of
heavy buffs, that are celebrated for the ardour with which they not
only hug themselves, in the confidence of success, but embrace—very

lancer than the sting of one of those venomous reptiles from which the
poor Mexicans have been obliged to protect themselves.
his address to his army, seems to have anticipated what is now going
on in Mexico, when he energetically exclaims,
“Let us be tigers in our fierce department?”
We confess that this style of coming to the scratch is about the most
tremendous that can be adopted; and we wish our Mexican fellow-
creatures well out of it.
PLAYING AT “ MAJESTY.”
BABELLA is “woo'd, and married, and a',” and is,
de facto and de jure, Queen of Spain. But the
CoNDE MonTEMoLIN must be king ; and as
nobody will acknowledge him in his own
country or in France under that title, he comes
to England, throws himself into the arms of
the Morning Post, and is duly crowned in the
editor's room, the compositors assisting. The
- ceremony of coronation must have been very
2 * affecting, the king being anointed with printers'
- ink. The solemnity concluded—we have not
space to give all the minutiae, the son of CARLos
becomes his Majesty—at least to the Morning
Post. “His Majesty” drives in the Park–
“His Majesty” visits the exhibitions—and “His Majesty” goes to the
Haymarket. Theatre, where (how very easy and convenient is play-
house royalty 1) “the orchestra,” says the Post, “played the loyal
Basque air, a compliment the delicacy of which was felt and appreciated
by His Majesty, and by the noblemen and gentlemen of his suite.” We
think the king ought to have sent for the leader of the orchestra, and
upon the spot have created him a grandee of the first class ; the title
would have been quite as valid—just as profitable, too—as that of the
Haymarket King of Spain. “You shall be a duke,” says the potentate
of the old play to the ambitious simpleton, “you shall be a duke, only
nobody must know it.” And after this fashion has the Count been
sº and anointed. He is a king—avers the Post—only nobody
nows it.
INVITATIONS TO DINNER.
* The Duke of CAMBRIDGE, after visiting the Smithfield Cattle Show,
sent round to the most important competitors the following circular, as
a proof of the high estimation in which he held them —
“His Roy AL HIGHNEss THE DUkr or CAMERIDGE presents his com-
pliments to the Prize Ox, and will be happy to have his company at
dimner any day next week, at the Freemasons' Tavern. A knife and
"fork will be laid for any of the Prize Ox's friends as may please to
accompany him.”
, Invitations were likewise despatched to the Prize Pigs. PRINCE
ALBERT's, which won the prize, have been specially honoured by His
Royal Highness with a card for a tête-à-tête dinner.
DIPLOMATIC WASTE PAPER.
Wr have been favoured with a peep at the trousseau of the Duchess
or Montressen. It is a joint present from Austria, Russia, and
Prussia, contained in a trunk lined with the Treaty of Vienna.
REGENERATION OF THE BRITISH DRAMA.
A GERMAN company has been invited to come over next season,
and it is expected they will perform at the Princess's. A Spanish
banker is in treaty for the Adelphi for the performance of Spanish
dramas, and there is a loud talk of the Lyceum being taken by a real
Bohemian nobleman for the legitimate Bohemian Polka and Hungarian
tragedies. Sadler's. Wells will, at the termination of the present
season, administer to the elevated taste of the present day with a
series of Poses Plastiques on the grandest scale—fifty professors are
engaged. Drury Lane will still maintain its character for ballet, as a
company of dancing Newfoundland dogs has been engaged, and will
perform the Battle of Waterloo, got up with dances and processions.
The celebrated French poodle Bijou will perform the part of NApol. EoN,
and take real snuff. The Haymarket will be opened with a troop of
Cossacks, who will give their national melodies, and act some of their
finest comedies. The St. James's will still remain in the hands of the
French company; so that, with the Italian Opera at Her Majesty's
Theatre, and another at Covent Garden, there is every hope that next
year there will not be a single theatre in London where the English
Drama, now almost obsolete, will be performed. An Englishman who
wishes to see a play of SHARspeARE's will have to run over to Paris,
or else go out by the Great Western to New York.
A Boon for Royalty.
As the gun-cotton explodes without any noise, we think HER MAJESTY
might, instead of having her ears deafened, every time she appears in
public, with endless salvos of artillery, be received with discharges
of cannon loaded with the above silent material. If the “National
Anthem,” also, could be discharged in the same way, without its
being heard, we are sure it would be a most pleasant relief to HER
MAJESTY ; but this is more than we can expect, as every little Mayor
who runs out of his parish to present himself and mace to the QUEEN,
is not likely to sing small on such an occasion, as his great object
is to make as much noise as he can whilst he is about it.

A PortRAIt of MR. O'Connell has been published at Dublin. It is
dedicated “To the greenest spot in the world.” The inscription under-
neath runs as follows:– “The only fulfilment of MR. O'Connell's
promise that unless Repeal was carried in a twelvemonth, he would put
his head upon the block.” We need not say that, for the sake of the
joke, the engraving has been done upon wood.

Don't Like the IDEA of throwing Myself away IN A hurry.”
TALES FOR THE MARINES.
TALE THE TENTH.
Excuse the question, Marines, but—how are you off for soap * Very
poorly, you will say. Exactly so. Fresh water is scarce on board ship,
and salt is incompatible with lather. Often, therefore, must you sigh
for the comfort of a good bath: feelingly would you appreciate the
blessing of one. So, were you to quit the service, and become members
of the labouring classes on shore, you would be greatly delighted with
the baths and washhouses which are everywhere provided for their
use. You may have heard, perhaps, that these institutions have been
more generally talked about than established:—be assured that this is
a calumny on the affluent. Baths and washhouses for the labouring
classes, in London especially, are much more plentiful than workhouses.
They are now about to be erected in St. James's, Westminster, where
they would have been built long ago, but for the population of that
parish being mostly so wealthy as not to be supposed to want them.
It has at length, however, been determined to introduce them, there,
for the accommodation of the poor few. A motion to that effect was
last week passed in the parochial vestry, not, (as was reported by the
democratical. Morning Post with a view to excite a prejudice against
the aristocracy,) by one vote; but unanimously. The Post asserts that
a Mr. GAsix opposed the motion, and said, “He did not think that
baths and washhouses were at all necessary, for the poor would not use
them when built.” Do you believe this? Do you suppose that
Mr. GASIN, (whom there is every reason to believe to be some benevo-
lent old gentleman,) would make a remark so dirty Oh no But
this by the bye.
The Baths and Washhouses are to be constructed forthwith, and—
this is the point for your special attention—on a scale of extreme mag-
nificence. The nobility and gentry of St. James's are determined that
the buildings shall, in every respect, do credit to their rank and opu-
lence. Accordingly, these baths and washhouses are to be designed by
MR. BARRY, who, no doubt, will render them, architecturally, monu-
ments of British art, as well as charity. Their interior arrangements
are to be most commodious, each separate bath is to be composed of
marble, and plentifully supplied with warm or cold water at option.
Nothing in the shape of soap will be thought of under brown Windsor,
except in the washhouses, where there will be a sufficiency of yellow.
The towels will be none of your huckabuck, but the richest damask.
Abundance of lavender water and other perfumes will be provided,
effectually to obviate the inconvenience which many of the inhabitants
of St. James's complain that they have experienced from the inferior
classes coming “betwixt the wind and their nobility.” In fact, the dis-
tinguished denizens of St. James's are resolved, if possible, to outdo the
Baths of Diocletian ; for they say that it is scandalous that Christian
London should be inferior in any respect to Pagan Rome. And this
is the Tenth authentic narrative which Punch has related to—the
Marines.
a New Extinguisher.
SoME enterprising candlestick-maker has invented a new extin-
guisher. It is in the shape of the WELLINGroN Statue; and when
placed on the top of the candle it has about the same proportions as the
original monster, on the top of the Hyde Park pedestal. It is called
the TRENch Extinguisher.
Worse AND Worse.
It is said that the Bey of Tunis has become music-mad, and intends
to take an Opera Company home with him. An incorrigible punster,
—the same who has been reprimanded several times without the least
effect—declares it to be natural that there should be a strong love of
tunes in a Bey of Tunis.
: THE CAMBRIDGE POLICE.
THE Police forces are more numerous than they have been generally
supposed to be. Besides the Metropolitan Detective and Rural police-
men, there is a distinct class of this useful body of men, called the
University Division, which is formed by the Proctors of Oxford and
Cambridge. The iden-
tity of the Proctor with
the Policeman, would
perhaps have remained
unnoticed, had it not,
both as regards their
office, and manner of
discharging it, been
strongly manifested the
other day. It is the
Policeman's duty to pa--
trol the streets. The
Proctor, also, has his
beat. The policeman is
prone to uncalled-for
exertion of authority.

was exhibited by the
Proctor at Cambridge.

ter, merely for appear-

reader judge. The
Spinning House is a

geon, and the poor
wretch caught her death
in it. And is this law?
Aye, marry is it—Col-
lege Law. With his
beat, behaviour, and sta-
tion, or Spinning House, >
is not the Proctor a
policeman all over? Not quite. To consummate the resemblance, he
wants an oil-skin hat and cape. As he unites the clerical with the
constabulary character, the uniform and buttons might be dispensed
with, as also the regulation highlows and Berlins. It may be questioned
whether the hat should not in form be that of a Master of Arts.
The collar, for a two-fold reason, should be lettered ; and further, to
indicate the combination of the officer and scholar, we propose to
substitute for the ordinary marking, the Greek letters and numerals,
as A 4, B 3.

THE SNOBS OF ENGLAND.
BY ONE OF THEMSELVES.
CHAPTER XLIII.-SNOBS AND MARRIAGE.
E BACHELoRs in Clubs are very
much obliged to you,” says
my old school and college
companion, Essex TEMPLE,
“for the opinion which you
hold of us. You call us selfish,
purple-faced, bloated, and
other pretty names. You
state, in the simplest possible
terms, that we shall go to the
deuce. You bid us rot in
loneliness, and deny us all
claims to honesty, conduct,
decent Christian life. Who
are you, MR. SNoB, to judge
us so 2 Who are you, with
your infernal benevolent
smirk and grin, that laugh at
all our generation ?
“I will tell you my case,”
says Essex TEMPLE ; “mine
and my sister Polly's, and
you may make what you like
of it ; and sneer at old maids,
and bully old bachelors, if
you will.
“I will whisper to you con-
fidentially that my sister
Polly was engaged to SER-
GEANT SHIRKER—a fellow
whose talents one cannot
deny, and be hanged to them,
but whom I have always
known to be mean, selfish,
and a prig. However, women
don’t see these faults in the
men whom Love throws in
their way. SHIRKER, who has
about as much warmth as an
eel, made up to Polly years and years ago, and was no bad match for a briefless
barrister, as he was then.
“Have you ever read Lord ELDoN's life Do you remember how the sordid old
SNoB narrates his going out to purchase twopence-worth of sprats, which he and
MRs. Scott fried between them 7 And how he parades his humility, and exhibits
his miserable poverty—he who at that time must have been making a thousand
pounds a year ! Well, SHIRKER was just as proud of his prudence—just as thankful
for his own meanness, and of course would not marry without a competency. Who
so honourable 2 Polly waited, and waited faintly, from year to year. He wasn't
sick at heart; his passion never disturbed his six hours' sleep, or kept his ambition
out of mind. He would rather have hugged an attorney any day than have kissed
Polly, though she was one of the prettiest creatures in the world ; and while she
was pining alone up-stairs, reading over the stock of half-a-dozen frigid letters that
the confounded prig had condescended to write to her ; he, be sure, was never busy
with anything but his briefs in chambers—always frigid, rigid, self-satisfied, and at
his duty. The marriage trailed on year after year, while MR. SERGEANT SHIRKER
grew to be the famous lawyer he is.
“Meanwhile, my younger brother, PUMP TEMPLE, who was in the 120th
Hussars, and had the same little patrimony which fell to the lot of myself and
Polly, must fall in love with our cousin, FANNY FIGTREE, and marry her out of
hand. You should have seen the wedding Six bridesmaids in pink, to hold the
fan, bouquet, gloves, scent-bottle, and pocket-handkerchief of the bride; baskets-
ful of white favours in the vestry, to be pinned on to the footmen and horses ; a
genteel congregation of curious acquaintance in the pews, a shabby one of poor on
the steps; all the carriages cf all our acquaintance, whom AUNT FIGTREE had
levied for the occasion; and of course four horses for MR. PUMP's bridal vehicle.
“Then comes the breakfast or déjeuner, if you please, with a brass band in the
street, and policemen to keep order. The happy bridegroom spends about a
year's income in dresses for the bridesmaids and pretty presents ; and the bride
must have a trousseau of laces, satins, jewel-boxes and tom-foolery, to make her
fit to be a lieutenant's wife. There was no hesitation about PUMP. He flung
about his money as if it had been dross ; and MRs. P. TEMPLE on the horse Tom
Tiddler, which her husband gave her, was the most dashing of military women at
Brighton or Dublin. How old MRs. FIGTREE used to bore me and Polly with
stories of PUMP's grandeur and the noble company he kept 1 Polly lives with
the FIGTREEs, as I am not rich enough to keep a home for her.
“PUMP and I have always been rather distant. Not having the slightest notions
about horseflesh, he has a natural contempt for me; and in our mother's lifetime,
when the good old lady was always paying his debts and
petting him, I'm not sure there was not a little jealousy.
It used to be Polly that kept the peace between us.
“She went to Dublin to visit PUMP, and brought back
everywhere—Her Excellency godmother to the second
boy. The eldest with a string of aristocratic Christian names
that made the grandmother wild with delight. Presently
FANNY and PUMP obligingly came over to London, where
the third was born.
“Polly was godmother to this, and who so loving as
she and PUMP now * “O Essex l’ says she to me, “he is
so good, so generous, so fond of his family; so handsome ;
who can help loving him, and pardoning his little errors ?’
One day, while MRs. PUMP was yet in the upper regions,
and Doctor FINGERFEE's brougham’at her door every day,
having business at Guildhall, whom should I meet in
Cheapside but PUMP and Polly 2 The poor girl looked
more happy and rosy than I have seen her these twelve
years. PUMP, on the contrary, was rather blushing and
embarrassed.
“I couldn't be mistaken in her face and its look of mis-
chief and triumph. She had been committing some act of
sacrifice. I went to the family stockbroker. She had sold
out two thousand pounds that morning and given them
to PUMP. Quarrelling was useless—PUMP had the money;
he was off to Dublin by the time I reached his mother's,
and Polly radiant still. He was going to make his fortune;
he was going to embark the money in the Bog of Allen—I
don't know what. The fact is, he was going to pay his losses
upon the last Manchester steeple-chase, and I leave you to
imagine how much principal or interest poor Polly ever
saw back again.
“It was more than half her fortune, and he has had another
thousand since from her. Then came efforts to stave off
ruin and prevent exposure ; struggles on all our parts, and
sacrifices, that (here Mr. Essex TEMPLE began to hesitate)
that needn't be talked of; but they were of no more use than
such sacrifices ever are. PUMP and his wife are abroad—
I don’t like to ask where ; Polly has the three children,
and Mr. SERGEANT SHIRKER has formally written to “break
off an engagement, on the conclusion of which Miss TEMPLE
must herself have speculated, when she alienated the greater
part of her fortune.’
“And here's your famous theory of poor marriages,”
Essex TEMPLE cries, concluding the above history. “How
do you know that I don't want to marry myself P. How do
you dare sneer at my poor sister 7 What are we but mar:
tyrs of the reckless marriage system which MR. SNoB,
forsooth, chooses to advocate 7” And he thought he had
the better of the argument, which, strange to say, is not
my opinion.
But for the infernal Snob worship, might not every one
of these people be happy 2 If poor Polly's happiness lay in
linking her tender arms round such a heartless prig as the
sneak who has deceived her, she might have been happy
now—as happy as RAYMoND RAYMoND in the ballad, with
the stone statue by his side. She is wretched because MR.
SERGEANT SHIRKER worships money and ambition, and is
a Snob and a coward.
If the unfortunate PUMP TEMPLE and his giddy hussy
of a wife have ruined themselves, and dragged down others
into their calamity, it is because they loved rank, and
horses, and plate, and carriages, and Court Guides, and
millinery, and would sacrifice all to attain those objects.
And who misguides them 2 If the world were more
simple, would not those foolish people follow the fashion ?
Does not the world love Court Guides, and millinery, and
plate, and carriages 7 Mercy on us ! Read the fashion-
able intelligence ; read the Court Circular; read the genteel
novels; survey mankind, from Pimlico to Red Lion Square,
and see how the Poor Snob is aping the Rich Snob ; how
the Mean Snob is grovelling at the feet of the Proud Snob ;
and the Great Snob is lording it over his humble brother.
Does the idea of equality ever enter Dives' head 7 Will it
ever ? Will the DUCHEss of FitzBATTLEAxE (I like a

THE POPULAR MOVEMENT.
AERTAINLY dancing seems
to be the Popular Move-
ment. The Baths in
Holborn have been open-
ed as a Ridotto, and the
Strand is advertised to
throw open its doors—
for the twentieth time
this season—as a Fras-
cati, in the hope, we
suppose, of its turning
up at last a trump card.
The Ridotto surprised
us. Where there were
formerly six feet of water,
there are now some thou-
sand feet of human
beings, pumping away
at the Polka in the most
vigorous style. We ex-
pected to have seen a
- quadrille danced in
pattens, and the Masters of the Ceremonies, we thought, would be
rushing about with mops, carrying away pails of water.
We imagined that the bath had been turned into a ball-room
for scientific skaters, who would go through a variety of new figures,
and that a new Russian ballet would be produced, to show what the
skate was capable of doing on clever heels. We inquired for a baignoir,
taking it for granted that would be the new term for the private boxes;
but the check-taker evidently misunderstood us, for he replied in an
indignant voice, “We ain't got none.” However, we went in to judge
for ourselves, and saw the bath filled with a stream of hats and bonnets
that kept pouring in all the evening. We plunged into the deepest
part, struck out into a quadrille, floated through a waltz, and did the
tread step in the Polka in the most buoyant manner. We never
recollect a more refreshing bath.
MOVEMENTS IN HIGH IIFE.
THE astronomers tell us that on the 30th of December, the planet
JUPITER will hold a sort of réunion of all his moons. JUPITER will
appear in all his belts, and the moons will form a very brilliant and
recherché circle. The assembly is expected to take place at exactly
eighteen minutes after seven, mean time, and in the mean time the
The
opposite motions of the first and second satellites, who are always going
different ways, and never hit their heads well together, will prevent the
pleasing assembly from being of very long duration. The group will
separate very early, for JUPITER and his moons are exceedingly regular
in their mode of existence.
It is to be hoped that the two moons who don't agree very well will
not reflect upon each other, or interchange any of their lunar caustic.
A Hopeless Case.
MR. Cobden—the Daily News informs us—in a letter to MR. HEN-
rerson, from Cadiz, says —“You are strong in the justice of your
claim, and you must try every appear to the honour and honesty of the
Spaniards ; and, if necessary, endeavour to shame them into the pay-
ment of their debts.” For “if necessary,” MR. ConDEN should have
written “if possible.” Spanish honour and Spanish honesty are equi-
valent to Punic faith and Irish gratitude.
OBITUARY.
We regret to have to announce the premature departure of John
Frost, Esquire, whose dissolution happened very suddenly, on the
morning of Saturday, the 19th of December. He had been in a very
hardy condition for several days, but at the period we have named, he
gave decided symptoms of breaking up, and the debt of Nature was
| soon liquidated.
3}untſ)'s Qijtigtmag Carol.
HERE comes Christmas—ancient, jolly,
Crown'd with mistletoe and holly.
Oh! the pleasure, oh the treat,
To behold the joints of meat—
With a concourse whilst we stop,
Gazing at each butcher's shop—
And the turkey-laden coaches,
Thickly thronging Town's approaches :
But a crowd, too numerous,
Answers, “What is that to us !”
In each grocer's window, see
What a heap of spicery !
Citron, cloves, and cinnamon—
What a sight to look upon I
Candied orange-peel, and plums,
Nutmegs, raisins, figs in drums;–
What delicious visions rise,
Of plum-puddings and mince-pies 1
Ah but thousands answer thus —
“Well-a-day ! what’s that to us 7"
Some, alas ! there are, to whom
Christmas brings but cold and gloom,
No warm fire, and no good cheer,
Though it comes but once a year;
Gentlefolks, suppose we try
If we cannot change their cry, .
And provide them with a reason
Thus to hail the jovial season :
“Christmas—though necessitous—
Thou art something still to us !”
THE CHILDREN OF THE LATE THOMAS HOOD.
WE need, perhaps, hardly make any apology to our readers for intro-
ducing into these pages the following paragraph from the Times
newspaper.
“CHILDREN of The LATE THoMAs Hood.—We are sorry to learn that the children
of the late T. Hood are, in consequence of the death of their last remaining parent, left
entirely dependent upon the small fund, amounting, we believe, to about 800l., collected
by public subscription at the period of MR. Hood's death. The pension of 100l. granted
by Srn Robert PEEL, ceases with the decease of MRs. Hood, who lived but a twelve-
month to enjoy it. We believe that Load JoHN Russell has already been applied to
by the friends of the family to continue the pension to the children, but his lordship has
intimated his inability to comply with the request, since the pension becomes, by the
death of Mrs. Hood, the property of the public.”
The public, if it could have its own way, would rather lose ten times
the sum, than deprive the children of Thomas Hood of one farthing of
the stipend, which, necessary as it might have been hitherto, must be
still more essential now, that they are without the care of even one
parent. Why is it that the Liberals will continually force us to draw
odious comparisons between themselves and their political rivals on
questions of practical liberality ?
ROYAL DISSOLVING WIEWS.
Louis-PHILIPPE is at a loss to know what to do with the Victoria
Gallery at Versailles. The meetings, the royal embraces, the festi-
vities at Eu, the whole series of pictures representing the ententecordiale
have been so completely thrown into the shade by recent events, that
the visitors only laugh at them.
into mourning, and cover them with the deepest crape. Another recom-
mendation has been to turn the pictures round, and set their faces to
the wall. The blank canvass would certainly present a correct pic-
ture of the present aspect of affairs, and could not possibly offend the
eye or the amour propre of the most patriotic Englishman or French-
Inlan.
The blanks, also, might be taken as a gallery of portraits of the
greatest statesmen of the present day, and a strong family likeness be
traced between the THIERSEs and the PALMERSTONs of the two countries.
But we think we have a proposition which will save Louis-Pimlippe the
necessity of colouring over the past, or drawing on the future. Let him
send the pictures to the Commissioners of our National Gallery, with
directions to have them thoroughly cleaned. When they have under-
gone that operation, the pictures can be hung up with the greatest
safety, as no one will be able to make out what they mean. They might
illustrate the next dozen victories which the French are sure to win, the
coming twelvemonth, over ABD-El-KADER, and no one be any the wiser.
This is what we call helping Louis-PHILIPPE clean through a difficulty.
It has been suggested to put them ||

HOMAGE TO A BRITISH PIG.
%llº
º
ºil
Louis-PHILIPPE is very anxious to induce HER MAJESTY to sub-
scribe again to the entente cordiale, which has been discontinued lately,
at Buckingham Palace, “until further orders.” The difficulty, how-
ever, has been to make a beginning ; but the Baker Street Bazaar has
afforded an opportunity which Louis-PHILIPPE, with his wide-awake-
ness, could not allow to pass. He has sent over to PRINCE ALBERT's
Pig, which won the prize, the Cross of the Legion of Honour, as a mark
of His Majesty's admiration of his greatness (the Prince's, not the Pig's)
as a British Farmer.
The Pig was anything but gratified at the compliment conferred
upon him, and kicked for a long time, (as well as his fat would allow
him,) against wearing it. He seemed to consider that it degraded him to
the level of a French pig, and he was melted to that degree, that two drops
of lard were observed to roll down his fat cheeks. He lost caste imme-
diately among his companions, dwindled down to a comparative shadow
of fifteen stone, and expired the same evening. Light be the mould
(candles) which will be raised from his body
We should mention that PRINCE ALBERT has not in the slightest
degree acknowledged the compliment paid to his Pig, but MADAME
TUss AUD has taken the dimensions of the sensitive-minded martyr, and,
as she goes upon the system of giving the public wax enough for their
money, she intends exhibiting a model of him, as large as life, in her
Chamber of Horrors.

Ha! I am moving—rapidly—more rapidly I am—I must be in

We have stopped—suddenly. They are wheeling the truck aside
How cold it is . We must be standing uncovered 1 Drip—drip—

Ugh ! It penetrates the hamper and soaks my straw—the duck stirs
within me. I suffer—I suffer—the mould is growing slowly over my
lid in this living tomb.-
Three days have we been standing here ! A dreary time ! I am
getting mouldier and mouldier—Ah ! that twingel I must be turning

How dark and noisome and damp is this truck 1 and to think that at
this moment a brilliant Christmas party may be waiting my arrival '

REFLECTIONS ON A TEA-TABLE.
KNow ye the land where the hot toast and muffin
Are emblems of deeds that are done in their spheres ;
Where scandalous stories and hints about nuffin,
Now melt into whispers, now rise into sneers ?
Know ye the land where the liquids and cake
Their circumvolutions consecutive make ;
Where Pompey's strong arms are oppressed with Pekoe,
And the air waxes faint with the scent of the sloe ;
Where malice produces its bitterest fruit,
And the voice of detraction can never be mute;
Where the tints of the story, the shades of the lie,
In number though varied, in falsehood may vie,
And the venom of scandal is deepest in dye :
Where virgins of fifty strange ringlets entwine,
In the fond misconception of looking divine *
'Tis the land of the teapot, the realm of the tray.

MUSIC IN EBONY.

figure of speech, of the magic strains
of WEBER and other composers ; but
Music is now literally assuming the cha-
racter of the Black Art. Heretofore,
Italy has been considered to be the land
of Song ; but Song seems to have lately
migrated to Ethiopia, if we may judge
from the popularity which has been
acquired by the serenaders of that nation.
Nigger melodies are now all the rage;
and even sentiment — whose accents
were always broken—rejoices, or rather
mourns, in broken English. It is to be
expected that Kentucky will shortly pro-
duce a HANDEL, Maryland a MozArt,
or Virginia a black Beethoven. St.

THE ENGLISH IN LITTLE.
BY GENERAL TOM THUMB.
THE GENERAL UPON EXETER HALL AND THE EGYPTIAN HALL.
BARNUM having hired a location at 'Gyptian Hall, ses to me, “Well,
Gen'ral, when do you feel disposed to show yourself to these English
critters ? If tainte done soon, they'll tear the door off the hinges.”
For BARNUM had put it about in all the papers, consarnin my visit to
Gracious Majesty to the Palace, sinkin, in course, the slight of the
back-stairs, for he didn't want to get up a war atween the two countries
afore we'd plucked the Britishers. “If tainte awful to hear the
smashin of carriage-poles and pannels in the street right under our
winders ; the aristocracy do so crowd to catch a glimpse on you.”
The aristocracy of England, be it understood, is sich a critter for the
5. grit ; the rael thing, special if it comes from anywhere across
the sea.
“BARNUM,” ses I, “I do feel a little streaked that you should bam-
boozle me about the baboon and the salmon, that made a mermaid
atween 'em ; there never was nothin o' the sort; father has been and
inquired ; and only that they saw his dander was up considerable,
they'd have kicked him out of the 'Gyptian Hall, slick.”
BARNUM ses nothin to this ; but I could see he was ryled tarnation,
for he stroddled like a pair of compasses across the room, and pulled
and pulled at the bell, as tho’ he was payed for pullin it. “Ax the
Gen'ral's father,” ses BARNUM to the help when he come, “to do me the
leetle favour of steppin up here.” And afore you could ring a dollar,
father was in the room.
“So, Ihear you’ve been to the Hall,” ses BARNUM, “now which way
did you go to it.”
“Out o' the house, down Bond Street, along Piccadilly, past Charin-
Cross-where the king, whose head they cut off, tho' he looks perkin
enough jist now, is sittin a horseback—then right up the Strand, and
on the left to a purty big stone house up steps.”
Somethin I could see was ticklin BARNUM ; but he only said, “You
never heerd, Mr. STRELtoN, Is’pose, of Exeter Hall f"
“Never,” ses father ; and BARNUM shakes his head, as much as to say
“Poor forlorn sheep.” However, in a minute he kinder smiled, and ses,
“What did you see at the Hall, Mr. STRELTon 7"
“Why," ses father, “I see a good many people, most on 'em in black,
with white cloths twisted 'bout their throats; and a good many on 'em
lookin as though they'd jist lost a dollar and not found a cent; and there
was a good many she critters—a lot on 'em with steel and tawtey-shell
spectacles on their noses, and some of 'em lookin as if they'd jist come
from picklin inions, and had a leetle of the vinegar in their faces.”
I could see BARNUM screw his mouth, as tho' he was suckinup a julep.
However, he ses, “Goon, I beg, MR. STRELtoN.”
“Well,” sesſather, “Ifollowed them as was going up, and after twistin
and turnin I found meself in a sort of horse-shoe place, filled with black
coats, and white cloths, and tawtey-shell spectacles. Afore me was a
large platform, very full of these critters. ‘Tarnation,’ ses.Itomeself.
“how on airth can they show the mermaid on that stage, if it is so full
of humans ? Taint givin the poor critterfair play.’ Well, they put
a solemn-faced, straight-haired human in a big chair, and the people
clapt and halloed ; and I heerd more than one tawtey-shell woman say
‘That's SIRRANDREw—that's the blessed Baronite!’ and others screech'd
“What a lamb of a man!’”
BARNUM wriggled and twisted, and then cried, smotherin a larf, “Go
on, MR. STRELton, go on.”
“Well,” ses father, “the chairman got upon his legs, and said “It was a
- delightful sight to see what he did see afore him, so many fellar country-
men and women,'—here one tawtey-shell began to sob-' and more, so
many foreigners.’ Well, thinkin this was nothin more than a purty
compliment to the flag, I cries out ‘Columbia thanks you, stranger,”
whereupon the meetin—sich was their manners to the freest citizen on
airth, screeched out “Shame!’ ‘Turn him out!” but I only screwed
meself tighter to the seat and grinned like a thousand wild cats at 'em.
“We are here assembled, ses the Chairman, “to cutoff anotherinch from
the tail of Satan! We have put down that sinfulingine the Sunday muffin-
bell, and we will not pause, or falter, or bate a jot of heart or hope, before
we see the day when the grass will grow in Lunnun streets on Sundays
—when people will go with their eyes upon the stones to church and
back again ; and not a soul—no, nothin but the benighted sparrows—
to be heerd in this wicked metropolis; and the Thames—so full of
steamers—be as the Dead Sea.” And then the people halloed, and the
Chairman sot down ; and other critters got up, and talked in the like
way. So at last, I gets up and goes out, and so down stairs, till I
come to a feller with a long stick in his hand, and goold upon his
collar, and goold about his hat. “When are they goin to show the
mermaid 7" ses I. “What do you mean º' ses he, looking a leetle
afire. ‘The critter,’ ses I, ‘that’s half woman half fish.” “No woman
o' the sort here, ses the goold band, mighty short. And then he turned
agin upon me, and ses, “You poor lost sheep—go, show your hum-
bleness, and crawl to home upon all fours. Well, I was too tickled by
his airnestness to beatallryled, so Ises, “Well, if I can't see the mermaid,
can I see the sarpents * I spose you know what a sarpent is, here to
the Hall.” “I should think so, ses Goold Band; “they’re smitin him
now up-stairs. The baronite has got him by the throat, and I wouldn't
be him for tuppence.’ I was in a bit of a fog; still it was such a curie's
critter, that I kinder humoured him. “And where,' ses I, ‘did the
Jibbeways show theirselves? where did they do the war dance 2 and
where's the Battle of Waterloo modelled in biscuit *—and where’ -
but afore I could say any more, Goold Collar lays his hand upon me,
and calls up one of the Perlice. “You will take this wretched heathen
to the station—and then afore the magistrate—and then to the treat-
mill, where they'll cut his hair, and larn him to be a Christian.” “ I
come here,' ses I, “to see the Mermaid, and have got my shilling
ready, if anybody had axed me for it.” “Go away, you great fool,
and don't make a noise,’ ses the Perlice, smilin like, and givin me a
good-natured shove down half-a-dozen steps. Well, the American
Eagle did a little expand his wings in my busum, but I smoothed him
down, and holdin my fist up at Goold Band, I whistled Yankee Doodle
—as loud as ten thousand canaries—and walked on.”
Here BARNUM bust into sich a fit of laughter, the fire-irons danced
agin. “MistäR STRELtoN,” ses he, when he’d come a leetle to, “You
must understand that in Lunnun there is two Halls—one is Exeter, and
one is 'Gyptian. Now, you have been to Exeter, and not to 'Gyptian.”
And so it turned out. Howsomever, as I am writin to Americans,
it’s only proper in me to warn 'em aginst the mistake; otherways,
from what is sometimes done and said at Exeter Hall, strangers
might sartimy believe they were at the 'Gyptian.
>readful rail in -itchen Stuff.
Sour inhuman boys established a slide outside the Baker Street
Bazaar, and the consequence was, that as the monster beasts came out
of the theatre, where they had been exhibiting, they slipped, went a few
yards down the slide, and then rolled over. We counted as many as
six mammoth pigs, and a prize ox at the top of them, all sprawling upon
the ground at the same time. The latter monster went down sorapidly,
that a gentleman compared it to “greased lightning.” The police cer-
tainly should have put over the slide a board marked “Dangerous.”
We never recollect an instance of meat going down so rapidly.
