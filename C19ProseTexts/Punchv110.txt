iy - PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [June 27, 1896.
“Well, I'm better used to grass or asphalte,” said Mr. PUNCH. “And perhaps I'm not so sweet on clouds as you
are—or were—my dear Ixion. You, from long experience, are doubtless used to “rolling in the air,'—on a wheel!”
The bold Thessalian actually blushed, and his impudent eye fell before Mr. PUNCH's significant glance. “I own
that I prefer innubilus ather—now,” said he. “But we've all sorts of tracks in Olympus. You pay your entrance fee,
and you take your choice. If you like to enter for the Golden Apple Handicap, JUNO, VENUs, and MINEnva will run you a
race on grass, or ATALANTA will give you a start, as a newer and swifter Milanion, over the Three Pippin Asphalte Track, at
your pleasure. As for me, I'm your man at any distance, over any track, from cloud-course to cinder-path !”
“You always were a cheeky chap, Ixion,” replied Mr. PUNCH, drily. “But how do your Olympian ladies look on
Wheels? Do they don—well, Divided Skirts; and do they go gracefully, or humped and awkward, like too many terrestrial
she-cyclists?”
ye. Look for yourself, Mr. PUNCH,” responded Ixion. “‘Here they come !' as your Derbyites yell, especially when a
Popular Prince looks like to win. Peep through the cloud-rift, and you, Mr. Pusch, like poor (FNONE,
“Mays’t well behold them unbeheld, unheard
Hear all, and, like young PARIs, judge of gods !”
Sure enough, there they came, Goddesses Three. “Great HERā," pearly-shouldered PALLAs, “Idalian Aphrodite,
beautiful,” all on the World-dominating Wheel, all in Olympian Cycling Costume, all working away at treadle and handle as
for dear life, like mere she-mortals at a mundane Cycle Meeting.
“What think you of my Three Olympian Pupils, Mr. PARIs-PUNCH2" asked Ixion.
“Humph 1” said the Sage. “Methinks, personally, I should have preferred them as they appeared of old on the
piny top of ‘many-fountained Ida.' Women on Wheels look less like goddesses than they do off them, in my opinion, and
goddesses on Wheels more like ordinary—very ordinary women. But I suppose the Wheel has “come to stay"—for some
time at least, in Olympus as in Hyde Park.”
“You bet!” laughed Ixion. “Why, even that pompous upstart, PHOEBUs, is practising biking at night on the strict
Q.T., and I expect soon will be putting down his stables, selling off his horses of the sun, and doing his daily round on
Wheels' But look out, Mr. PARIs-PUNCH ! This course is two laps to the mile, and the Illustrious Three will be back
presently, when you will have to award the Apple——”
“Not at all, Ixion, my boy!” retorted Mr. PUNCH. “I have a better and fitter prize for the Olympian winner than
any Golden Apple. My work and my awards are not for a mere cycle, but for all cycles, and cycles of cycles, “not for an age,
but for all time, like my friend, WILLIAM of Avon's.” -
“And what is that prize of prizes for the Olympian winner of winners or champion of champions?” asked Ixios,
curiously.
“Not a mere Golden Apple, but a veritable Golden Book,” responded PUNCH, displaying to the amazed and interested

JANUARY 4, 1896.]
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 1
-
MR. PUNCH'S NEW YEAR PHILOSOPHY.
[HERAcLITUs was called “the mourner” from
his weeping at the follies of mankind.]
WHAT, weep the world's follies? That’s
playing the fool,
Like a jester who droppeth his tears in a
ol;
'Tis #. damming a deluge with water!
HERACLITUs had hardly the happy way hit,
Tears will not check follies as we
Which giveth those follies no quarter.
What use at the goose-flock to groan or to
grizzle P [fizzle,
A laugh may succeed when a tear may mean
And what is more dull than damp fire-
works?
DEMochirus, Laughing Philosopher, knew
That a man make look blue over fools till
all’s blue;
That’s just how all pessimist ire works.
A lsº * a lash, wit an edge far from
un.
They whip up, without wounding, when
grumble or grunt
Will only add anger to folly.
A fool under scolding is like your dull ass,
Who won't mend his form formere whopping,
alas !
So let's be, judiciously, jolly!
Untimely heroics, and preachments sublime,
Are tempting to iuvenile censors, whom time
Will teach to be rather more rosy.:
Not optimist boobies, nor pessimist bores,
They will learn that wise gaiety oftentimes
scores
When foiled fall the pompous and prosy.
as gay wit, I –
And so at this solemn, yet soul-cheering
Season,
All wise men, like Punch, mingle laughter
with reason;
And ; East and West things look
darkish,
Punch does not mean joining the fussy or
frantic,
He sends a gay greeting across the Atlantic,
A blend of the loving and larkish.
Sponting Underwriter, "Would You Like
To INSURE 7"
Bold Bird. “No I LL TAKE THE RIsk I'
At—somebody's-folly he laughs, and derides
The notion of shindy between the two sides
Of one double-fronted fraternity. ..
Faithful friends' falling-out-for a time—a
huge bore is; - -
But—here’s to the redintegratio amoris/-
A love that should last to eternity.
Away º the doves with an olive-branch
eaſºn .
Good temper and fun better lessons will
teac
Than many more high-sounding Messages.
Keep faith, at this season, in Peace and
Goodwill !
will I
Keep temper, and sure the New Year will
;"
Mr. Punch's non-pessimist presages,
HERAcLITUs, poor chap, was a little bit out;
A good hearty laugh may kill hatred ol
doubt,
If 'tis not too bitterly mocking.
“The Mourner” had best, on the whole, be
Mute
Laugh! Laugh!, save at sorrow ; the mal
is mere brute
Who at misery chortles; that’s shocking !
But Punch's first tip for this next of New
Years
Is—don't weep at men's follies, nor laugh a
their tears!
UP To DATE.
SERING that the New Woman proudly dream
Of sharing Man's immunities and joys,
The properd: for the period seems,
“Girls will be-boys!”

** TXION himself, by all that's wonderful!" said Mr. Punch, addressing—in defiance of mere mundane injunction—
the Man at the Wheel.
“Mr. Punch and none other, by all that's delightfull" responded the Thessalian, trimming his bicycle lamp as
tenderly as a masher tittivates his budding moustache.
“Happy to meet you, I'm sure—anywhere !” smiled the omnivagant Sage, pleasantly. “But how on earth did you
get out of Hades and into Heav well, say Olympus?”
“On my Wheel,” answered Ixion. “It has proved a Wheel of Fortune to me—in the long run. I fancy I hold
the record for long distance, anyhow.”
“But how did you contrive to turn your wheel of torment into a Rota Fortuna, Ixion ?”
“As DisPAELI—who was a man after my own heart—made me write in JUNo's album, “adventures are to the adven-
turous.' MERCURy—who is not a bad fellow for a turnkey—first gave me the tip. In this epoch the Wheel rules the world !
Olympus is awfully Conservative. But Olympus is also dull—as your Philosopher said most Conservatives are. And Olympus,
like the Greeks, is always glad of ‘some new thing,' if it be adroitly introduced. Now DisrAELI and I shared that useful know-
ledge how to educate a Conservative party—like the followers of Jove or DERby—without scaring it into revolt. Olympus
—especially the she-side of it—was awearying for some novelty which was not as old as the hills or as stale as the New
Fiction. To be brief, I cleverly converted my wheel of torture, and the chains wherewith I was bound thereto—MERCURY
winking while I worked—into a Safety Bike | Then he whispered to JUPITER and JUNO that I was having quite a good
time on my converted cycle. Curiosity did the rest, and now WULCAN and his Cyclops (floated as ‘The Etna Cycle Company,
Limited') are so full of orders even Jove has to give six weeks' notice when he wants a new Wheel. Ha! haſ hal"
“Ho! ho! ho!” echoed Mr. PUNCH. “There seems to be a lot of human nature not only in humanity, but in
divinity also. I presume you are quite a persona grata again—especially with the goddesses?”
“I believe you, my bhoy " said the Thessalian, with a wink. “Olympus now ought rather to be called Olympia.
Your Miss PATTisons, MARIE PAULEs, and Mlles. Solanges are not in it, either for zeal or pace, with JUNo, VENUs, MINERVA,
and that tremendously tenacious long-distance championess, dear DIANA Are you a wheelman, Mr. PUNCH2"
“Am I not Everything in excelsis 2" queried the Sage, coolly. “I wonder at your asking such a question I'll
take you, or any of your Olympian ‘cracks,’ gods or goddesses, on at any distance you likel"


























“On a cloud-course?” asked Ixion, archly.

“Well, I'm better used to grass or asphalte,” said Mr. PUNCH. “And perhaps I'm not so sweet on clouds as you

your pleasure. As for me, I'm your man at any distance, over any track, from cloud-course to cinder-path !”
“You always were a cheeky chap, Ixion,” replied Mr. PUNCH, drily. “But how do your Olympian ladies look on
Wheels? Do they don—well, Divided Skirts; and do they go gracefully, or humped and awkward, like too many terrestrial
she-cyclists?”

Popular Prince looks like to win. Peep through the cloud-rift, and you, Mr. Pusch, like poor (FNONE,
“Mays’t well behold them unbeheld, unheard
Hear all, and, like young PARIs, judge of gods !”
Sure enough, there they came, Goddesses Three. “Great HERiº," pearly-shouldered PALLAs, “Idalian Aphrodite,
beautiful,” all on the World-dominating Wheel, all in Olympian Cycling Costume, all working away at treadle and handle as
for dear life, like mere she-mortals at a mundane Cycle Meeting.
“What think you of my Three Olympian Pupils, Mr. PARIS-PUNCH 2" asked Ixion.
“Humph 1” said the Sage. “Methinks, personally, I should have preferred them as they appeared of old on the
piny top of ‘many-fountained Ida.' Women on Wheels look less like goddesses than they do off them, in my opinion, and
goddesses on Wheels more like ordinary—very ordinary women. But I suppose the Wheel has “come to stay"—for some
time at least, in Olympus as in Hyde Park.”
“You bet!” laughed Ixion, “Why, even that pompous upstart, PHOEBUs, is practising biking at night on the strict
Q.T., and I expect soon will be putting down his stables, selling off his horses of the sun, and doing his daily round on
Wheels' But look out, Mr. PARIs-PUNCH ! This course is two laps to the mile, and the Illustrious Three will be back
presently, when you will have to award the Apple——”
“Not at all, Ixion, my boy!” retorted Mr. PUNCH. “I have a better and fitter prize for the Olympian winner than
any Golden Apple. My work and my awards are not for a mere cycle, but for all cycles, and cycles of cycles, “not for an age,
but for all time, like my friend, WILLIAM of Avon's.”
“And what is that prize of prizes for the Olympian winner of winners or champion of champions?” asked Ixios,
curiously.
“Not a mere Golden Apple, but a veritable Golden Book,” responded PUNCH, displaying to the amazed and interested

MR. PUNCH's NEW YEAR PHILOSOPHY.
(HERAcLITUs was called “the mourner” from
his weeping at the follies of mankind.]
WHAT, weep the world's follies P. That's
playing the fool,
Like a jester who droppeth his tears in a
ool;
'Tis #. damming a deluge with water!
HERACLITUs had hardly the º way hit,
Tears will not check follies as we -
Which giveth those follies no quarter.
What use at the goose-flock to groan or to
grizzle” [fizzle,
A laugh may succeed when a tear may mean
And what is more dull than damp fire-
works?
DEMochirus, Laughing Philosopher, knew
That a man make look blue over fools till
all’s blue;
That’s just how all pessimist ire works.
A lsº * a lash, wit an edge far from
un.
They whip up, without wounding, when
grumble or grunt
Will only add anger to folly.
A fool under scolding is like your dull ass,
Who won't mend his form formere whopping,
alas
So let's be, judiciously, jolly!
Untimely heroics, and preachments sublime,
Are tempting to juvenile censors, whom time
Will teach to be rather more rosy.:
Not optimist boobies, nor pessimist bores,
They will learn that wise gaiety oftentimes
scores
When foiled fall the pompous and prosy.
as gay wit, -
And so at this solemn, yet soul-cheering
season,
All wise men, like Punch, mingle laughter
with reason;
And § East and West things look
darkish,
Punch does not mean joining the fussy or
frantic,
He sends a gay greeting across the Atlantic,
A blend of the loving and larkish.
Sponting Underwriter, “Would You Like
To INSURE 7"
Bold Bird, “No I LL TAKE THE RIsk I'
At—somebody's-folly he laughs, and derides
The notion of shindy between the two sides
Of one double-fronted fraternity.
Faithful friends' falling-out-for a time—a
huge bore is;
But—here’s to the redintegratio amoris!-
A love that should last to eternity.
Away ** doves with an olive-branch
each .
Good temper and fun better lessons will
teac
Than many more high-sounding Messages.
Keep faith, at this season, in Peace and
Goodwill! -
Keep ºilº, and sure the New Year will
ful
Mr. Punch's non-pessimist presages.
HERAcLITUs, poor chap, was a little bit out;
A good ºty laugh may kill hatred or
doubt,
If 'tis not too bitterly mocking.
“The Mourner” had best, on the whole, be a
Mute
Laugh! Laughl save at sorrow ; the man
is mere brute
Who at misery chortles; that’s shocking !
But Punch's first tip for this next of New
Years
Is—don't weep at men's follies, nor laugh at
their tears!
UP TO DATE.
SERING that the New Woman proudly dreams
Of sharing Man's immunities and joys,
The properČ: for the period seems,
“Girls will be-boys!”

ROBING-ROOM RUMOURS.

THERE is no truth in the report that,
following the precedent about to be set
by Mr. Asquith, in appearing before his
fellow Privy Councillors, many of the
Judges of the High Court are accepting
retainers to represent either Plaintiffs
or Defendants in their own Divisions.
At least this extension is not likely to
be carried out just at present.

The proposed representation of “A
New Pantomime,” by the late Dr.
KENEALLY, at Gray's Inn, will certainly
not take place during the present Christ-
mas. If the work is played at all, it
will be without scenic accessories.
-

It is asserted that, at the recent
meeting of the deputation from the Bar
Committee with the LoRD CHANCELLoR,
smoking was not permitted. As the
proceedings, however, were of a semi-
private character, it is , uncertain
whether liquid refreshments were dis-
º: with arguments of a less material
Ilature,

It is not improbable that, with a view
to removing the block of legal business,
that some of the railway companies will
run, during the present year, “High
Court Saloon Carriages,” in which ac-
commodation will be provided for the
Bench, the Bar, the solicitors, and their
clients and witnesses. If the matter of
venue can be satisfactorily arranged,
causes will thus be ready for hearing
during transit. There is already a re-
Corded precedent of a Judge granting an
injunction from the front of his bathing-
machine.

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
ON NEPHEws—AND “HUCKLEBERRY FINN.”
It has been granted to me during the last few days to study a
soaring human boy face to face. The abstract “my nephew” of
whom I, occasionally speak in passing, has become the concrete
: Guy, don't do this,” or, Guy, don't do that.” My study is
littered with paper darts of all sorts and sizes; a clasp-knife is at
this moment lying open on my favourite arm-chair, a catapult is on
the floor (perhaps the safest place for it), and odd numbers of Chums
are strewn about the house. The owner of these articles is dashing
up and down the stairs, with a whole pack of dogs at his heels.
GUY, is, an atom of. humanity, tottering on the brink of his
eleventh birthday. His fond mother consign im to my care,
together with a long list of instructions. “His usual bed-time,”
she said, “is eight o'clock. Please, please see that he brushes his
teeth morning and evening, and keeps his hands clean. When he
goes out he must wear his overcoat and his little flannel comforter;
and when he comes in you must always insist on his changing his
stockings. Keep him out of puddles, and see that he does at least
an hour at his arithmetic and Latin Grammar. He is weak in
arithmetic; but in Latin Prose he got full marks at his last exami-
nation. Don't allow him to make himself a nuisance to you. If he
does, give him a good book of adventures, and you'll find him as
quiet as a mouse.” These were the more important items in the
compendium drawn up for the guidance of a bachelor uncle.
So far I have done my best, but my best has stopped short of Latin
grammar and arithmetic. I can remember how keenly Idetested the
genial old gentlemen who, on hearing that I had gone to school, asked
me, to decline mensa, and posed me with the perfect tense of fero,
and in my nephew's case I satisfied myself with his personal assurance
that he had been able to translate into Latin these memorable
sentences:-"C+SAR marched into Italy with a large army,” and
“We were seen by CALUs, your slave.” A boy who can do that, and
For the rest, I found him fairly amenable... He jibs a good deal, at
his overcoat, and has contrived to lose his little flannel comforter; his
bedtime has been extended to nine o'clock; I have utterly failed to
restrain him from puddles (our country roads, by the way, are
nothing, but so many huge puddles); and I find it next to impossible
to keep his hands clean, though he has immaculate intervals lastin
for about three minutes at a time. But he brushes his teeth an
he changes his stockings, so I feel that on the whole I have done
pretty well.
OF, course he collects postage-stamps. He also takes a pro-
found interest in smoking and all that pertains to it. He goes
about bristling with cigarettes so as to be ready to supply my
needs at the shortest notice. He is never, without a tray, into
which he knocks the ash from my cigarette as I smoke it. He
has just come in and has posted himself at myelbow. Whizz-bang,
he has decided that I have finished my cigarette, he has seized it out
of my mouth, hurled it into the fire, has jammed another between
my lips and has struck a match and burnt the cigarette to a cinder
before. I have recovered from the shock, . He has found a box of
fifty cigars and clipped all their ends, and he has filled my ten pipes
with tobacco so as to be ready for all emergencies. It is delightful
to find a mere boy able and willing to make himself so useful.
... BUT his usefulness goes further. Only this morning I found him
in the pantry busily employed in helping the butler to polish up the
forks and spoons, and yesterday he was allowed, as a great treat, to
take a hand in the manufacture of a plum-pudding. To-morrow he
is to wait at table, a prospect which seems to fill him with unutter-
able joy; Qn the whole he is really a very good and cheerful little
boy, with plenty of resources for his own amusement. One thing has
struck me about him. He weighs about five stone, and his size,
therefore, is not gigantic. Still, in his little knickerbocker suit, he
looks quite big enough for his years. But in the evening he wears a
full-dress Eton, suit, which has the effect of reducing him to the
merest scrap; the most diminutive shrimp, I warrant, that ever got
full marks for Latin prose.

present day. This one—and I presume he is typical of the rest-
calls me flºwſ: my Christian name without the respectful
º: “Uncle.” hen asked why he did this, he said, “Oh, I
on't know, "uncles' are people with whiskers.” As my whiskers
did not survive º freshman's year at Cambridge, it appears that
I am not, qualified, for the title, though I cannot shake off the
responsibilities of the post. , His ideas on age are also rather alarm-
; “How old,” I asked him, “is the head-master of your
school?” “Oh, middle-aged—nearly thirty.”
BUT my chief surprise has been his keen and appreciative enjoy-
ment of Huckleberry Finn. I gave it to him to quiet him, and he
was soon deep in it. This evening he has insisted on reading aloud
to me the whole of that inimitable passage which relates how the
two old frauds, the King and the Duke o *ś. pretended to
be the brothers of Mr. Peter Wilks, deceased. At every other
sentence that boy had to stop, convulsed with laughter, and, mind
you, he laughed in the right way and at the right things. This is
no mere piece of knockabout clowning such as one supposes would
appeal to a small boy, but a bit of the most genuine and incisive
humour ever printed. I am, therefore, forced to the conclusion-
still assuming GUY to be typical— hat the sense of humour
amongst jº. of a tender age has become far keener and juster
than it used to be.
BUT, after all, what a great book is Huckleberry Finn. With
how lavish a hand has MARK Twain scattered the riches of his
humour and his observation, and his sympathy over every page.
There is enough in it to fit out twenty ordinary books with laughter.
There are bits of description in it which bring a scene before your
eyes as vividly as if you had seen it over and over again and fixed
it on your mind. Characters are hit off in a few incisive touches, and
the man stands before you as he must have lived.
TAKE this for description:–“It was one of these regular summer
storms. It would get so dark that it looked all blue-black outside,
and lovely; and the rain would thrash along by so-thick that the
trees off a little ways looked all dim and spider-webby; and here
would come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and
turn up the pale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper
of a gust would follow along and set the branches to tossing their
arms as if they was just wild; and next, when it was just about the
bluest and blackest—fst! it was as bright as glory, and you'd have
a little, glimpse of tree tops, a-plunging about, .# off yonder
in the storm, hundreds of yards further than you could see before;
dark as sin again in a second, and now you’d hear the thunder let
o with an awful crash, and then go rumbling, "...º.;
own the sky towards the underside of the world, like rolling empty
barrels downstairs, where it’s long stairs and they bounce a good
deal, you know.”
AND this:—“ Colonel Grangerford was a gentleman, you see.
He was a gentleman all over; and so was his family. He was
well-born, as the saying is, and that's worth as much in a
man as it is in a horse, so the widow Douglass said, and nobody
ever denied she was of the first aristocracy in our town; and pap
he always said it too, though he warn’t no more quality than a
mud-cat, himself. , Colonel Grangerford was very tall and very
slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it any-
wheres; he was clean-shaved every morning all over his thin face,
and he had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of
nostrils, and a high nose and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind
of eyes, sunk so deep like they seemed they was looking out of
caverns at you as you may say. His forehead was high, and his
hair was black and straight º hung to his shoulders. . . . Some-
times he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he straightened
himself up like a liberty pole, and the lightning begun to flicker out
from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first, and find
out what the matter was afterwards. He didn't ever have to tell
anybody to mind their manners—everybody was always f.
mannered where he was. Everybody loved to have him around too:
he was sunshine most always—I mean he made it seem like goo
weather. When he turned into a cloud-bank it was awful dark for
half a minute and that was enough; there wouldn't nothing go
wrong again for a week.”
THEN for simple, unforced pathos you have the runaway is:
Jim, one of the finest and purest gentlemen in all literature. d
for tragedy, can anything be more moving and terrible than the last
stand of the Grangerfords, or the death of Boggs, with its sequel
in Colonel Sherburn's º: defiance of the cowardly mob,
who propose to lynch him?.. But I have not space to dwell on all the
great points of this Homeric book—for Homeric it is in the true
sense, as no other English book is, that I know of.
So I (and my nephew) send this message of goodwill across the
d|reconcile her to her father, the general commanding
will and friendship are sorely needed. That the coun en of
DICKENs and MARK Twain should fight about Venezuela is an
idea so fantastic and preposterous that imagination boggles at it;
and even the mind of the worst Jingo of either nation must revolt
from it when it is fully realised.
P.S.—A week or two back I asked about the National Pension
Fund for Nurses, and expressed a wish to know the address of its
Secretary. A kindly correspondent, signing herself “An Admirer
of Mr. Punch of Fifty Years' standing,” gives me the necessary
information, which I hereby convey to my readers in the earnest

DIVISION OF LABOUR.
It Is Not THE BUSINEss or DUCAL FootMEN TO CLEAN THE FAMILY BICYCLEs.
THE LADIEs ERMYNTRUDE AND ADELGITHA
HAVE TO Do IT THEMSELVRS.
A PROPHET TOO PREVIOUS.
(To the Author of the “Hill-top Novel.”)
THE “Survival of the Fittest” we begin to understand,
(Though we sometimes doubt the fact of the survival,)
But the coming of GRANT ALLEN, with his notions queer, if grand,
Seems an instance of its premature arrival.
Many hundred years ahead of us, and yet “dumped down” to-day
Among those who his far ancestry should be!
It is really quite “too previous” and the Fates must be at play
To perch upon our hill-tops such as he.
When centuries get mixed up so, and there comes a saintly seer
From the twenty-fifth, six centuries in advance,
What wonder if we find his hill-top theories wild and queer,
And decline at his new tunes to up and dance?
No...we don't want to catch up to him, and were he out of sight,
We could wait for him six centuries, extented,
But his spectre-on the hill-tops-fills the timid with affright,
And drives advanced young ladies half-demented.
Between good Mrs. GRUNDY and Miss LANCHESTER it seems
There are dangers in our novelist's new leaven,
It drives one to hysterics, makes the other dream strange dreams,
But will it sweeten home or brighten heaven?
You dedicate your work to those who’ve heart, and soul, and brain
Enough to understand it! Modest! Meek, Sir!
Can't you move a leetle farther good GRANT ALLEN, and remain—
Well-say about the middle of next week, Sir!
AN UNPREDICTED STORM.
A storm of unusual violence, coming from the United States
struck the British coasts on the 18th ult. The usual storm warning
from New York had not preceded it. It was accompanied by loud
thunder and blustering winds, and seemed likely to cause great
damage, Happily a condition of great calmness prevailed over the
British Isles, the cyclonic disturbance seeming to have little effect,
unless to cause a temporary increase in thefog and gloom. Since then
appearances give hope of greater clearness, with probably bright and
settled conditions later,
Mount Cleveland, a large volcano hitherto quiescent; and of Mount
Olney, a smaller, but equally active, centre of fiery disturbances.
Until recently, they were considered quite harmless. The Irish
newspapers state that both craturs had been for some days in a state
of violent ebullition. Before this outburst the summit of Mount
Cleveland was densely wooded, and produced a larger number of
inferior Fº: used in the construction of platforms, than any other
headland in the United States. The present yolcanic condition has,
of course, entirely superseded the production of these inferior planks.
“DR. BIRCH AND HIS YOUNG FRIENDS.”
JUST before the holiday time a drawing-master was summoned
before Mr., HADEN CoRskh by an indignant female... parent for
chastising her offspring. The master had merely anticipated the
general season of gifts with a Christmas Box on the boy's ear.
"The mother,” observed Mr. HADEN CoRSER, with a staccato touch
of HADEN's surprise in his tone, “is within her right in complain-
ing,” and so HADEN the Politer—never “the Corser”—fined the
drawing-master three guineas, for which he had to draw a cheque,
and bound him over in five pounds to come up for judgment when
galled on. HADEN the Politer well and wisely remarked that it was
beyond his powers (as a magistrate), to imagine what course the
aggrieved parent would have taken had her son been a public school-
boy at Eton, Harrow, Rugby, or Winchester, where the birch, in
some form or other, and on some form or other, or some part of it
was the rule of punishment, where the boy would be swished, and
where the head-master's swish over-ruled the parent's wish. At
Eton, and at any other public school, the boy 'could take it (the
swishing) or leave it (the school),'. and would be only too glad to
accept #. “post hoc propter hoc" instead of having to retire from
public (school) life. Every boy ought, to know how to take his
whack and be glad of the chance. ...Also, on certain occasions, he
should be able to return the whack with interest.
Mr. HADEN CoRSER is the Solomon of the Bench, and had..he
reminded the sensitive mother of that wise saying of the Wise King
as to the sparing of the rod and the spoiling of the child (though in
this case, it may be admitted that the rod was not in question, but
only a handy mode of chastisement), it would not have been amiss.

It is believed that this storm originated in a violent outburst of

“EVERYTHING COMES TO HIM THAT “WAITS.’ ”
THE HAUNTED HAT.
(Tag-end ºf a Ghost Story written for Christmas or any other time.)
ANGELINA could not understand the cause of her misfortunes. All
through the day she had had the luck against her. She had visited her
favourite spinster aunt (from whom she expected to inherit wealth untold),
and that usually amiable old lady had treated her with marked coldness.
“I don't know what it is,” said the venerable dame, “but there are
voices in the air, ANGELINA, accusing you of murder, I can hear them, I
can, indeed!’
“My dear Aunt, what nonsense! But there, I only looked in to show
you my new hat. Do you like it?”
44 W. no,” returned the elderly spinster; “I don't care for such a
heap of feathers. The original material is completely hidden in a perfect
nest of wings. The hat is º: of limitless slaughter.”
“It is the fashion,” replied ANGELINA, rather angrily; “and what
is the fashion must be nice.” -
And then the ruffled maiden, after a cold adieu addressed to her aged
relative, took herself off. She visited several of her friends, but one and
all complained of the voices. They heard in the air accusations of assassi-
nation. ANGELINA was “an accessory after the fact,” and these cruel
indictments quite eclipsed the success of the hat. The head-gear was
pronounced here, and there “stylish,” but the cry of “murder” over-
whelmed the praise. At last ANGELINA met EDWIN.

from her in horror.

“EVERYTHING COMES TO HIM THAT “WAITS.’ ”
THE HAUNTED HAT.
(Tag-end ºf a Ghost Story written for Christmas or any other time.)
ANGELINA could not understand the cause of her misfortunes. All
through the day she had had the luck against her. She had visited her
favourite spinster aunt (from whom she expected to inherit wealth untold),
and that usually amiable old lady had treated her with marked coldness.
“I don't know what it is,” said the venerable dame, “but there are
voices in the air, ANGELINA, accusing you of murder, I can hear them, I
can, indeed!”
“My dear Aunt, what nonsense! But there, I only looked in to show
you my new hat. , Do you like it?” .
“Well, no,” returned the elderly spinster; “I don't care for such a
heap of feathers. The original material is completely hidden in a perfect
nest of wings. The hat is º: of limitless slaughter.”
“It is the fashion,” replied ANGELINA, rather angrily; “and what
is the fashion must be nice.” -
And then the ruffled maiden, after a cold adieu addressed to her aged
relative, took herself off. She visited several of her friends, but one and
all complained of the voices. They heard in the air accusations of assassi-
nation. ANGELINA was “an accessory after the fact,” and these cruel
indictments quite eclipsed the success of the hat. The head-gear was
pronounced here and there “stylish,” but the cry of “murder” over-
whelmed the praise. At last ANGELINA met Edwin.
“What is the matter?” cried the girl, as her betrothed turned away
from her in horror.
-

The young man spoke earnestly. He had been called to the
Bar, and spoke as if addressing a jury.
“Then you no longer love me!” sobbed ANGELINA.
“How can I?” replied Edwin. “The birds are witnesses
against you. I am fully aware of the consequences. I know
the dangers of breaches of promises of marriage. But, ANGE-

AN INTERVIEW IN COMMON FORM.
(From a Note-book found in the land of Personalia.)
THE house of the great man did not differ
very materially from the dwelling-places of
his neighbours. The regulation portico, the
customary area, the white-washed stucco
front were all there to carry out the resem-
blance. The hall, too, was not unlike other
halls of other mansions. The butler, the
footman, and the housemaids had nothing to
distinguish them from fellow-menials filling
like situations in other ménages.
“Can I do anything for you?” asked the
Great Man, with a smile.
“Well,” I replied, “it is only fair to tell
you that I come in the character of an inter-
viewer. To save time, I will not give you my
opinion of things in general, and yourself in
particular, for the simple reason that I can
add it as padding when I come to the com-
“Quite so,” responded the Great Man, em-
phatically; “I commend your excellent good
sense. d here let me say that this is not

‘been done to death,’ to use a colloquialism,
Ishould not have had the honour and pleasure
of this introduction. In fact, you, from an
editorial point of view, would have been
regarded as valueless for copy.”
“No doubt,” returned the Great Man,
laughing heartily and good-naturedly. “But
I have the advantage—thanks to my scanty
but, for this purpose, sufficient experience-
ºf knowing the sort of thing you want to
learn. For instance, I have a cup of tea at
seven, eat a hearty breakfast at nine, lunch
lightly at two, and reserve eight o'clock for
dinner.”
“Thank you very much,” said I, making
the entry in my note-book; “and now tell
me—do you take soup P”
“I have not for many years. I must con-
fess, too, that I dilute the deadly cold of the
morning tub with a little boiling water.

“A mixture of both. As a child, the
favourite punishment of my mother was the
order of ‘no pudding.” Thus, as quite an
infant, I lost my appreciation of tarts. What
was commenced by my maternal parent was
completed by my doctor. I have been ordered
to give up fruit pies.”
We laughed heartily at this quaint descrip-
º: and for a moment or two my pen was
usy.
‘’’Is there anything else I can tell you?”
“I suppose you go to the seaside in the
summer, and occasionally run over to Swit=
zerland in the autumn P. That you are fond
ºf dogs and children? That your wife takes
a deep interest in your work? Then you
have cozy corners in your house, and that
kind of thing P”
“To be sure,” replied the Great Man, who
had been nodding affirmatively to my various
queries. “But everything connected with
the house you will surely leave to the photo-
grapher? I presume I shall have the pleasure
of making his acquaintance?”
It was my turn to bow, and bow I did, with
a smile. -
“And now,” said my host, “I am going
to ask a slight favour. All I have told you
would probably be equally applicable to my
good friends and neighbours, BRown, Jones,
SMITH, and Robinson P You acquiesce in
the suggestion? Quite so; then give all the
interesting particulars you have collected, but
avoid mentioning my name.”
“But your personality is what will interest
the public.”
“Yes; but this sketch will do for any one

And, as the idea was a novelty, I adopted
the suggestion.

NEW DICTIONARY.
(Being some occasional notes intended as a contribution towards a
“Lady's Own Dictionary of Words and Phrases.”)
“AGGRAVATE.” This word, according to men's dictionaries, means
“to exaggerate: to make enormous, &c.”; but the fair sex, not con-
tent .. this simple definition, have given it another, which is, to
anger, to irritate. For instance, in women's language, the expres-
sion, “an aggravating thing,” is generally understood to signify a
person who causes us anger or displeasure. If a man were to to
a woman of an “aggravated injury,” she would probably not know
what he meant. ...But if he were to describe her dearest friend's con-
duct as aggravating, she would immediately understand him.
“So.” This little adverb is a great favourite with ladies, in con-
junction with an adjective. For instance, they are very fond of
using such expressions as “He is so charming !” “It is so lovely l’’
&c. According to the rules of strict grammar, the use of the adverb
“so,” and of the adjectives “lovely” and “charming,” requires to
be followed, in both these sentences, by the use of the conjunction
“that.” “He is so charming !” is a purely feminine, expression.
“He is so charming that I have made a friend of him,” is a purely
masculine one, or should be so. . It is satisfactory to know, however,
that ladies have nothing whatever to do with the rules of strict
grammar.
It is hoped that these two extracts will for the present suffice to

HOW TO KEEP A DIARY.
(Taught by the Contents.)
January 1.-Intend to preserve in this little volume the written
record of my life. Now and again, I shall give my thoughts, m
aspirations. Any event of commanding importance, of course, #.
appear in its proper sequence in these pages. I shall not omit refer-
ence to domestic details of purely personal interest, for out of such
seemingly homely materials ** an interesting biography is ulti-
mately carefully compiled. And now to commence. Went out
to-day to have my hair cut. Later on, a family gathering. Present,
my Uncle JACK, Aunt JEMIMA, and the boys. Dinner passed off
pleasantly. The only discordant note was Bobby's, allusion to
Cousin PortER's will. I think the contretemps that followed was
caused by thoughtlessness rather than by malice. Still, it was a bad
omen for the otherwise glad New Year.
January 2-And now to continue the story of my career from day
i. day. Obliged to go out. Will return to this volume when I get
Ome.
January 12–Had my hair cut. Gloves, 3s.6d. Fellow told me
last night that the only way to get good cheroots was to write to
Manilla direct.
January 31,–Afraid I have not kept this diary very regularly.
However will make a fresh start, and not get into arrears again,
This morning I rose at seven, had breakfast (sausages, tea, and eggs)
at eight. Off to chambers at ten. Led in an important case (Baulks
versus Corkes) and obtained a verdict. ToxikINs, J., complimented
me. On my way home met my Cousin CHARLIE. He dined with us,
and tells me that Gussº returned from Canada last Autumn. She
is engaged to be married, Dear me! How time flies! It seems
only the other day that she was playing with her doll!
March 5.-Had my hair cut to-day. Must keep this diary more
regularly. What is the benefit of a diary unless you use it? Pause
for a reply. Saw the BEyehley Robinsons in the Park. It appears
that it was not their fault that the silver €pergne passed out of the
family, The facts are these—
March 6–Was interrupted yesterday as I was giving the true
story of the épergne, . However it is just as easy and appropriate to
enter it under this date as any other. Well, to commence—
April 19–Omnibus 2d. Cab 2s. 6d. Gingerbread nuts 4d. Re-
payment of portion of loan at Bank £153 10s. 6d. Address of the man
i. marble statues-247, Araminta Avenue East, Lower Tooting
ane.
May 1.-Really ashamed to find how slack I have been in keeping
this diary. However, in future I will make entries daily. This
morning went to the British Museum to verify dates in my new
boºk, Remembrances Recalled on the Stage-side of the Green Cur-
tain. I was right. Professor Anderson was lessee of Covent Garden
Opera-house when it was burned down after a bal masqué. Met
CHARLIE HogaRTH. The same as ever. Awfully good fellow. Dined
at the club, and went to see Sinbad up to Date. Quite like old
times. A morsel of mild American cheese in a plain lettuce salad not
half bad. CHARLIE's recipe. Good chap, CHARLIE!
August 3.-Decided to go to Kiel.
September 9.-Braces, 1s. 6d. GUssDE married the Captain. My
present of a card-table, made of Japanese fans, pretty. Only
fault, there were nine other duplicates. That's the worst of getting
wedding-gifts from the Stores. Some other chappie is sure to choose
the same! -
October 25.-My birthday! I have been sadly remiss in keeping
this diary hitherto, and will mend the fault for the remainder of the
quickly passing year. To-day I reach my prime. Well, I have not
done so badly; my practice is fairly good—at any rate pays the rent
of my chambers, and keeps me in gowns and wigs. Then my editor-
ship of The Moon-Gazers Monthly Magazine has been entirely
satisfactory to the proprietors. If I quarrelled with BoBBY's Rosſe
it is only because she was so extremely rude to poor dear. TRIXY in
the train. However, in that matter, it’s more their loss than ours!
So I can regard the situation with equanimity!
November 12.-Had my hair cut.
December 14,-Gloves 3s.6d. Aunt MARIA's, day is first and
third Fridays. Kidneys cut into thin slices, then covered with

THE AUGUSTAN AGE AT OLYMPIA.
THE classic ground close to the elongated mile once known as
“Punch's Railway” is again popular. Thanks to the efforts of the
great DRURIoI.ANüs-cum-ADDison Rodias, Olympia is very much to
the fore. On Boxing afternoon and night crowds thronged to see
the last thing in Derbys and the newest idea of the
Chitral campaign. Both events are perfect mar-
vels of realism. The mob that supplies a back-
round to the winning of the Blue Riband of the
could not be surpassed as a specimen of “the
convincing.” There are real ‘’’ARRIES” and
“’ARRIETs,” soldiers, sailors, acrobats, and, last
but not least, police-constables. The horses, too
seem to §§ the sport, and if they are not ail
“winners,” they compare favºurably with many a
successful competitor for a Queen's Plate. But
the feature of the equestrian show is unquestion-
ably the crowd of spectators. . With the assistance
of many hundreds of auxiliaries, the hill is realised
with its numberless vehicles, its series of booth
and, last and least, its poor, forlorn forsaken, an
much-chivied iſſerby dog. Then Ölympia has, as
is quite right and correct, races by ladies, bicycles ... . [.. Q
and donkeys. Those who are to be responsible for “W)
the coming meeting in Athens might secure an -
object-lesson in West Kensington. If Greece follows in the wake of
* #." Road, all should be well at the international gathering
01 athletes.
And if the Race for the Derby is satisfactory, the Relief of Chitral
is equally excellent. The soldiers who gallantly occupy the boards,
once the home of the largest ballet troupe of the world, are reserve
men, and members of that constitutional force, “the bold Militia.”
These fine fellows must delight the descendants of the Brook Green
Volunteer, whose traditional training-ground, it will be remem-
bered, was in the neighbourhood. For the rest, there is eve
º that the present excellent entertainment will draw crowde
ouses twice daily to Olympia far into the ; New Year, and
possibly into those years to come in the approaching century.

To the President of the Royal
Academy of Arts.
My LoRD,--On this auspi-
cious Occasion I have the
honour to ºffer my Congratu-
lations. My Friend, Dr.
SAMUEL JoHNson, of whose
Literary Attainments you
have been informed by his Bio-
i. Mr. Boswell, would
oubtless join me in my
Felicitations to your Lordship,
my successor, if he were not at
present somewhat disturbed in
mind by the Contemplation of
the melancholy fact that his
Dictionary is rapidly becom-
ing obsolete. He passes many
hours in lonely Meditation,
murmuring to himself words
of some barbarous Jargon, such
as “bike,” “slump,” “jingo,”
and the like. This circum-
stance is the more to be
regretted, since he has com-
mended several of your
Addresses, written in Lan-
guage even more classic, more
stately, and, perhaps, more
beautiful than his own, and
would, therefore, have felt
assured that by your Lordship,
in any case, his Dictionary is
still consulted and admired.
Mr. GoLDSMITH and Mr.
GARRICK request me to con-
vey their d Wishes. I
have the honour to be, Your
Lordship's most obedient,
humble servant,

SOMETHING FOR HIM TO DO.
At this time of excitement, Mr. Punch drinks the new Laureate's
health, and calls upon him for a song, impromptu, appropriate, and
to be sung immediately. Anything patriotic he may have handy
will do. The moment is critical, which is more than his enthusiastic
audience will be, if he only pitches it in the right key. But Lord
SALISBURY, who has made the piper, has a right to call the tune. By
the way, according to a note in The Westminster, the new Laureate
is entitled to receive, all in a lump, the salary due for the three past
years duing which time the office has been vacant. So the first thing
ALFRED, monarch of minor poets, will have to do is, not to sing, but
to “draw.” Hooray! for SALISBURY and Salaryl Quite a Sunday-
best-and-Top-Hat-ford Day! Tune up! Twang the lyrel What
rhymes to “Pretoria” if not “Wictoria” ” But rather less easy to
get something neat to rhyme with “Wenezuela,” eh? Still, within
the reach of practical poetry and the petit maître.
A CASE IN COURT REHEARD.
All Abroad finds itself “quite at home” at the Court Theatre,
Mr. WILLIE Edouin very funny, with his singing and dancing, and
with his phonographic business. Miss MAY Edouin is a charming
ingenue, delighting the jury of the Court
with a very pretty song, “Two Sweet Little
Love Birds.” Elle ira loin, Mr. SCGDEN
appears as a witness to “character’’:
capital. , Mr. FRED KAYE is as eccentric as
ever, and Mr. DAVID JAMEs acting, dancing,
and singing, follows in the footsteps of his
father, especially in the dancing. Miss ||
GRAce PALotta makes a hit with the song
cf “The Business Girl.” Altogether the
amusing evening's entertainment has not
suffered in its transit across London from
the Criterion—where it gained a favourable
verdict at the bar of public opinion—to the
Court, where, it having been already “part
heard,” it is being tried over again, until ,
further notice, before new judges and
juries, who have to pronounce upon several 2 7- -
new songs, of which not a few are encored, 2%
and before whom is brought a mass of new evidence not produced at
the previous trial. The verdict ought to be Success; and, at all
events, the members of Miss Cissy GRAHAM's Company at Manager
ChudLEIGH’s theatre “have the Court with them.”

No. II.
Some account of Mr. Jabberjee's ea periences at the Westminster Play,
BEING forearmed by editorial beneficence with ticket of admission
to theatrical entertainment by adolescent students at Westminster
College, I presented myself, on the scene of acting in, a state of
liveliest and frolicsome anticipation on a certain Wednesday evening
in the month of December last, about 7.20 P.M. -
At the summit of the stairs I was received by a posse of polite and
stalwart striplings in white kids, who, after abstracting large
circular orifice from my credentials, ordered me to ascend to a lofty
gallery, where, on arriving, I found every chair pre-occupied, and
moreover was restricted to a prospect of the backs of numerous
juvenile heads, while jº. to remain the livelong evening on the
tiptoe of expectation and Shank's marel - - - - --
This for a while I endured submissively from native timidity and
retirement, until my bosom boiled over at the
sense, of “Civis Romanus sum,” and, de-
scending to the barrier, I harangued the
wicket-keeper with great length and fervid
eloquence, informing him that I was graduate
of high-class Native University after passing
most tedious and difficult exams with fugitive
colours, and that it was injurious and dele-
terious to my “mens sana in corpore sano”
to remain on legs for some hours beholding
what I practically found to be invisible.
But, though he turned an indulgent ear to
my quandary, he professed his inability to
help me over my “pons asinorum,” until I
ventured to play the ticklish card and inform
him that I was a distinguished representa- ºf
tive of Hon'ble Punch, who was paternally *
anxious for me to be awarded a seat on the
lap of luxury.
Then he unbended, and admitted me to the
body of the auditorium, where I was con-
ducted to a coign of vantage in near proximity
to members of the fair sex and galaxy of
beauty.
Thus, by dint of nude gumption, I was in
the-bed of clover and seventh heaven, and
more so when, on inquiry from a bystander,
I understood that the performance was taken
from Mr. TERRIss's Adelphi Theatre, which
I had heard was conspicuous for excellence
in fierce cºmbats, blood-curdling duels, and
scenes in court. And I narrated to him how
I too, when a callow and unfledged hobbardy-
hoy, had engaged in theatrical entertain-
ments, and played such parts in native
dramas as heroic giant-killers and tiger
slayers, in which, I was an “au fait” and
“facile princeps,” also in select scenes from
SHAKSPEARE's play of Macbeth in English
and being correctly attired as a Scotch.
But presently I discovered that the play
gender, and
elderly gentlemen, appeared, they were all exclusively masculine in
there was nothing done but to converse by twos and
threes. When the third portion opened with a long-desiderated
peep of petticoats, I told my neighbour confidently that now at last
we were to see this dancing girl and the abduction; but she replied
that it was not so, for these females were merely the mother of the
wife of another of the youths and her attendant ayah., And even
this precious pair, after weeping and wringing their hands for a
while, vanished, not to appear again. -
. Now as the entertainment proceeded, I fell into the dumps with
increasing abashment and mortification to see everyone around me,
ay, even the women and the tenderest juveniles! clap the hands and
laugh in their sleeves with merriment at quirks and gleeks in which
—in spite of all my classical proficiency—I could not discover le mot
pour rire or crack so much as the cream of a jest, but must sit there
melancholy as a i. cat or smile at the wrong end of the mouth,
For, indeed, I began to fear that I had been fobbed off with the
smattered education of a painted sepulchre, that I should fail, so
dolorously to comprehend what was plain as a turnpike-staff to the
veriest British .. and suckling 1
However, on observing more closely, I dis-
covered that most of the grown-up adults
present had books containing the translation
of all the witticisms, which they secretly
perused, and that the feminality, were also
provided with pink leaflets on which the dark
outline of the plot was perspicuously in-
scribed. Moreover, on casting my eyes up to
the gallery, I perceived that there were over-
seers there armed with long canes, and that
the small youths did not indulge in plauda-
#: and hilarity except when threatened by
ese,
And thereupon I took heart, seeing that
the proceedings were clearly veiled in an
obsolete and cryptic language, and it was
simply matter .# rite and custom to applaud
at fixed intervals, so I did at Rome as the
Romans did, and was laughter, holding both
his sides as often as I beheld the canes in a
state of agitation.
I am not unaware that it is to bring a coal
from Newcastle to pronounce any critical
opinion upon the ludibrious qualities of so
antiquated a comedy as this, but, while I am
wishful, to make every allowance for its
having been composed in, a period of pre-
historic barbarity, I would still hazard the
criticism that it does not excite the simpering
guffaw with the frequency of such modern
standard works as, exempli gratiâ, Miss
Brown, or The Aunt of Charley, to either
of which I would award the paſm for pure
whimsicality and gawkiness. . .
Candour compels me to admit, however,

guffaw with the frequency of such modern
standard works as, erempli gratiâ, Miss
Brown, or The Aunt of §: to either
of which I would award the palm for pure
whimsicality and gawkiness. -
Candour compels me to admit, however,
that the conclusion of the Adelphi, in which
a certain magician summoned a black-robed,
steeple-hatted demon from the nether world,
who, after commanding a minion to give a
pickle-back to sundry grotesque personages,
did castigate their ulterior portions severely
with a large switch, was a striking ameliora-
tion and betterment upon the preceding scenes, and evinced that
TERENCE possessed no deficiency of up-to-date facetiousness and
genuine.humour; though I cºuld not but reflect-“Q, si sic
omnia.” and, lament, that he should have hidden his ris comica
for so long under the stifling disguise of a serviette. -
... I am a beggar at describing the hurly-burly, and most admired
disorder amidst which I performed the descent of the staircase in a
savage perspiration, my elbows and heels unmercifully jostled by a
dense, unruly horde, and going with nose in pocket, from trepida-
tion due to national cowardice, while the seething mob clamoured
and contended for overcoats and hats, around very exiguous,aper-
ture, through which bewildered custodians handed out...bundles of
sticks and umbrellas, in vain hope to *. such impatience. Nor
did I succeed to the recovery of my hat and paraphernalia, until
after twenty-four and a half minutes (Greenwich time), and with
the labours of Hercules for the golden fleece!
For which I was minded at first to address a sharp remonstrance
and claim for indemnity to some º: in authority; but perceiv-
ing that by such fishing in troubled waters I was the gainer of a
j umbrella, fresh as a rose, I decided to accept the
olive branch and bury the bone of contention.

PAGE FROM EUROPA'8 DIARY.
Sunday.-Calm of the most
absolute character. Pulpit sub-
jects cf a purely perfunctory
nature. Expected immediate ap-
pearance of the Millennium.
Monday.—Continuation of the
peace. The silerce of harmony
unbroken. Monarchs of all sorts
live in charity with all men, and,
in their dreams, exist only in
Arcadia.
Tuesday.-Tranquility main-
tained. Ambassadors fleep, and
Parliaments adjourn for want
of work. Nothing stirring but
stagnation.
Wednesday.—Political barome-
ter at “Set Fair.” A storm
anywhere impossible. The lion
has laid down with the lamb.
The contents bills ºf the papers
have to fall back upon tricky
headlines to sell a copy of the
periodicals they represent. Public
consequently sold as well.
Thursday. — The world fast
asleep. Dicky birds the only
disturbers of the ubiquitous peace.
A HOME TRUTH.
Irate Stepfather. “I can't Think where You LEARN such MAN-
NFRs. You Don't see ME sliding Down THE BALT stERs AND

Friday,+Not a ripple any-
where. Blue sky on view in
every land of the universe. Tri-
umph of the dove and the olive
branch.
Saturday.-Sudden outbreak!
Roweverywhere! National strug-
gles the order of the day! Fire
and the sword take precedence in
every civilized and uncivilized
community! Expected immediate
approach of Pandemonium!
CRY OF THE INCOME-TAX'D.
[“It ought to be a fundamental
principle of the next Budget to reduce
the income-tax by at least a penny.”
—The “Times” on “The Surplus.”]
º |THAT policy were “penny-wise.”
Indeed, but not “pound-
foolish.”
Let's hope that unto our loud
ories -
Hicks-BEACH will not prove
mulish.
My cry to him is (like the Pte-
man's)
“Please give me a penny!”
May his be not (like Simple
Simon's),
“I have not got any l’”
PAx.—There is now prospect of
peace and quiet in one place, at
all events, and that is immedi-
ately at Osborne and at the Court
generally, for Dean FARBAR has
“replaced the Rev. Rowe Jollºy
as Deputy Clerk of the Closet in
Waiting.” So in that locality
there is temporarily no more to
be heard of a Jolley Rowe.
QUoTATION ADAPTED BY MR.
CH-MB-RI-N-" ‘Bores' et ‘Pre-
toria’ nihil.'”
ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
The LAST SHOOT OF THE SEAsON,
SUBMITTING to the fate of all things bright and fair, the shooting
season of 95-'961s drawing to an end, lamented by all who love gocq
sport and big bags. The combination is a common one in these days,
when even keepers are º to understand that those who shoot
care less for a slaughter of easy, birds than for a chance of exercising
their skill in pulling down tall birds from the region of clouds. It
may safely be asserted that all the big bags of pheasants are made by
guns placed well back from the coverts where the birds are likely to
be high up in the air by the time they are shot at. The shooting is
made difficult, greater skill is necessary on the part of the shooter,
and the bird shºt at has a greater chance naturally of saving its life.
These wouli seem to be self-evident propositions; but I gather
from the ingenious and accomplished “R.APIER’s” notes in the
January number of the Badminton, Magazine, that there are still
“papers of a certain class” in which one may read “sarcastic
comments on the making of big bags of pheasants. The writers
calculate how many birds are killed per minute, and after a little
indulgence in statistics, wind up with a sneer at the ‘sport’—in
inverted commas.” I have in my time read such comments, but not
very lately. However, I must take “RAPIER’s” word for it that
there still exist journalists sufficiently abandoned to make them,
though I do not suppose even the most sarcastic of them would refuse
to eat a pheasant which had been beaten over a distant line of guns,
or would prefer to it a bird shot º “bone-scatterer” at the
very edge of the covert, or by an old-fashioned “walker-up” within
a few feet of the muzzle of his gun.
A KEEPER's one object is to make the biggest bag he can. . If the
º: of the shoot is left to him—quod di arertant—he will
place his guns as near as possible to the edge of the covert, so that
DE GREY or Lºrd Walsingham, is detestable. He would rather
shoot at, even if he misses, one high bird flying strong, than blow
ten easy ones to pieces. Therefore in a properly managed shoot the
guns are placed well away, although often the keeper looks gloomy,
and confides to his intimates that he doesn't see the use of having
taken “a peck o' trouble if they birds aint to be shot where, as you
may say, a gun can shoot 'em.”
Bur putting all that aside, what a glorious season this has been in
nearly every part of the country. From all sides you hear the same
story of fine, strong, hearty birds, and plenty of them. I. do not
claim for pheasant-shooting the virtues of an athletic exercise, but
it does require in the highest degree coolness, resource, precision and
self-control—qualities that are not without their value in other and
more important pursuits. Nor is his endurance to be despised who
stands and waits in a cool and nipping wind, or in storm of rain such
as the variations of our climate often send down upon our heads.
Then it is, if you wear a mere cloth cap, that you envy the shooter
whose hat has a brim to guard his neck; for first with a casual
tickle, and then with a steady, relentless flow, the frosty water makes
its way from the back of your head, down between your neck and
your collar, and down, ever down along the channel of your spine.
ghl the mere remembrance is enough to give you the influenza.
AND now the time of the last shoot has come or is coming. Once
more, and for the last time, the array of beaters is, summoned.
There they all are, those stolid, autochthonous British labourers,
differing not so much in expression as in the signs of age; imper-
turbable, slow, and as impervious to thorn-bushes as they are to the
voice of the keeper when he bids them keep the line, or come up
faster on the one side or the other. But watch these same beaters
when a rabbit appears in their midst, especially after lunch has
made their mood merry, and you will see a wonderful change. Not
otherwise does a maiden, shy with the reserve of her first season,

they may smash the birds while they are still flying slow and low,
This to a true sportsman, even if he is not a shot of the class of Lord

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
The LAST Shoot of THE SEASON.
SUBMITTING to the fate of all things bright and fair, the shooting
season of 95-'961s drawing to an end, lamented by all who love gocá
sport and big bags. The combination is a common one in these days,
when even keepers are º to understand that those who shoot
care less for a slaughter of easy birds than for a chance of exercising
their skill in pulling down tall birds from the region of clouds. It
may safely be asserted that all the big bags of pheasants are made by
guns placed well back from the coverts where the birds are likely to
be high up in the air by the time they are shot at. The shooting is
made difficult, greater skill is necessary on the part of the shooter,
and the bird shot at has a greater chance naturally of saving its life.
These wouli seem to be self-evident propositions; but I gather
from the irgenious and accomplished “R.APIER’s” notes in the
January number of the Badminton, Magazine, that there are still
“papers of a certain class” in which one may read “sarcastic
comments on the making of big bags of pheasants. The writers
calculate how many birds are killed per minute, and after a little
indulgence in statistics, wind up with a sneer at the “sport’—in
inverted commas.” I have in my time read such comments, but not
very lately. However, I must take “RAPIER’s” word for it that
there still exist journalists sufficiently abandoned to make them,
though I do not suppose even the most sarcastic of them would refuse
to eat aFº: which had been beaten over a distant line of guns,
or would prefer to it a bird shot either by a “bone-scatterer” at the
very edge of the covert, or by an old-fashioned “walker-up” within
a few feet of the muzzle of his gun.
A KEEPER's one object is to make the biggest bag he can. . If the
º: of the shoot is left to him—quod di arertant—he will
place his guns as near as possible to the edge of the covert, so that
DE GREY or Lºrd Walsingham, is detestable. He would rather
shoot at, even if he misses, one high bird flying strong, than blow
ten easy ones to pieces. Therefore in a properly managed shoot the
guns are placed well away, although often the keeper looks gloomy,
and confides to his intimates that he doesn't see the use of having
taken “a peck o' trouble if they birds aint to be shot where, as you
may say, a gun can shoot 'em.”
But putting all that aside, what a glorious season this has been in
nearly every part of the country. From all sides you hear the same
story of fine, strong, hearty birds, and plenty of them. I. do not
claim for pheasant-shooting the virtues of an athletic exercise, but
it does require in the highest degree coolness, resource, precision and
self-control—qualities that are not without their value in other and
more important pursuits. Nor is his endurance to be despised who

Then it is, if you wear a mere cloth cap, that you envy the shooter

tickle, and then with a steady, relentless flow, the frosty water makes

Ughl the mere remembrance is enough to give you the influenza.
AND now the time of the last shoot has come or is coming. Once

EVERY ONE'S GOOD HEALTH !
As the festive season draws to a close, when the plum of the
pudding is heard of no more, when the mince-pie lingers only in
the memory, when the bear's head ceases to adorn the buffet in
the castle hall, when the chemist has done his best and the doctor
has departed, when elderly maidens begin to regret lost oppor-
tunities afforded by now vanished mistletoe boughs, and when, by
the disappearance of the sprigs of holly, the schoolboy is reminded
of the rapid approach of the blossoms of the birch tree, then is the
hour when the Lordly Baron solemnly bethinketh him that some
change of air will be beneficial to his state of health. Opportunely
he receiveth a copy of the Fortnightly Review for January, wherein
the title of an essay, “The Climate of South Africa and its Curative
Influence,” attracteth his kindly regard. Of South Africa and its
gold wotteth he somewhat: it needs no BARNATO to tell him this. Of
the climate he hath heard, but as to its “curative influence” he
hath received no information whatever. At a glance, and with half
an eye, he grasps the fact that “consumption” is to be grappled
with in South Africa and its baneful effects neutralised. The
learned medico, yolept Dr. Robson IUS Roose, whose signature is to
this brief but most interesting article, shows “how,” “when,” and
“where” to go in search of recuperating the vital forces at Frazer-
burg, Victoria (West), Aliwal (North), and Kimberley, ranging from
4000 to 4500 feet up in air, places, Alas, as far above the ordinary
means of the ordinary patient as they are above the level of the sea.
The benevolent doctor should tell us where the £4500 is to be ob-
tained by the patient who would with pleasure ascend these 4500
feet!! But even if the patient obtains the ways and the means, how
about the Rhodes, the CECILRHODEs P. Won't the climate, just now,
be a little too hot for any Englishman? So, we must wait till, first,
STOPPED.
THE other day, when I was down in the country, I suffered from
severe toothache. I decided to come up to town the next morning.
see a friend of mine, a famous dentist, and get back by the 3.30
express after lunch at my club. He is a capital fellow, as kind as he
is clever, and he touches one's aching jaw with a hand as gentle as a
woman's. So, rather than consult a stranger in the country, I
resolved on a three hours' journey to town, to see my friend. -
Having, some other, business to do, I started early, breakfasting
very lightly and hastily at 7:30, and catching the 8.23 train after a
six-mile drive in the keen, bracing air. My business delayed me a
little; my friend delayed me more. . He is so much occupied.
When at last he was able to see me and had stopped my tooth, it was
past two, and I was very hungry., “Come with me,” I said, when
he had taken out of my mouth his hands, his instruments, and other
impediments to conversation, “and have lunch at the club. I'm
ravenous.”
“All right,” he said. “I’ve half an hour; I'll come, Open
your mouth once more. Wider, please. Yes, I’m rather hungry,
too. Had my breakfast very early, and very little of it. But you
mustn't eat anything, you know.” I almost bit his hand off in my
effort to shout “What?” with my mouth filled with a napkin,
| dentist's mirror, &c., “No,” he said, “you mustn't bite anything
|fºr two hours at least, or you’ll spoil all the * ..You may
have a little soup.” When we got to the club I had a little soup.
| And when he my friend had finished, and I had indignantly waved
away the tooth-picks handed to me by the waiter, there was only just
time to catch the 3.30 express, which doesn't stop anywhere, and
doesn't carry any provisions.
| To have no teeth must be very uncomfortable, but to have plenty,

we get the £4500—and then?
and to starve, so to speak, in the midst of them, is infinitely worse.

No. III.
Mr. Jabberjee gives his views concerning the Laureatship.
IT is “selon les régles” and rerum naturá that the QUEEN's Most
Excellent Majesty, being constitutionally E. to poetry, should
desire to have constant private supply from respectable tip-top
genius, to be kept snug on Royal premises and ready at momentary
notice to oblige with song or dirge, according as High Jinks or
idolorousness are the Court orders of the day.
But how far more satisfactory if Right Hon’ble Marquis SALIS-
BURY, instead of arbitrarily decorating some already notorious bard
with this “cordon bleu.” and thus gilding a lily, should throw the
office open to competition by public exam, and, carefully
weighing such considerations as the applicant's res angusta dom;
the fluency of his imagination, his nationality, and so on-should
award the itching palm of Fame to the poet who succeeded best in
tickling his fancy!
Had some such method been adopted, the whole Indian Empire
might to-day have been pleased as Punch by the selection of a
Hindoo gentleman to do the job—for I should infallibly have entered
myself for the running. Unfortunately such unparalleled opportunity
of throwing soup to Cerberus, and exhibiting colour-blindness, has
been given the slip, though the door is perhaps still open (even at
p." o'clock P.M.) for retracing the false step and web of
enelo
For fºould respectfullv submit to Her Imperial Majesty that, in
her duplicate capacity of Queen of England and Empress of India,
she has urgent necessity for a Court Poet for each department, who
would be Arcades ambo and two of a trade, and share the duties with
their proportionate pickings.
Or, if she would be unwilling to pay the piper to such a tune, I
alone would work the oracle in both Indian and Anglo-Saxon
departments, and waive the annual tub of sherry for equivalent in
cash down.
And, if I may make the suggestion, I would strongly advise that
this question of my joint (or several) appointment should be severely
taken up by London Press as matter of simple justice to India. This
is without prºjudice to the already appointed. Laureate as a swan
and singing bird of the first water. . All I desire is that the Public
should know of another—and, perchance, even rarer–avis, who is
nigroque simillima cygno, and could be obtained dog cheap for a
mere song or a drug in the ...}. if only there is made a
National Appeal to the Sovereign that he should beforomoted to such
a sinecure and aere perennius.
As a specimen of the authenticity of my divine flatulence, please
find inclosed herewith copy of complimentary verses, written by
myself on hearing of Poet AUSTIN's selection. Indulgence is kindly
requested for very hasty composition, and circumstance of being
reatly harrowed and impeded at time of writing by an excruciating
ull-sized boil on back of neck, infuriated by collar of shirt, poul-
ticings, and so forth.
CoNGRATULATORY ODE.
To Hon'ble Poet-Laureate Alfred Austin, Esq.
Hail! you full-blown tulip!
Qh! when the wheezing zephyr brought glad news
Of your judicious appointment, no hearts who did peruse,
Such a long-desiderated slice of good luck were sorry at,
To a most prolific and polacious Poet-Laureate!
For no poeta nascitur who is fitter
To greet Royal progeny with melodious twitter. .
Seated on the resplendent cloud of official Elysium,
Far away, far away from fuliginous busy hum,
You are now perched with phenomenal velocity
On vertiginous pinnacle of poetic º !..
Yet deign to cock thy indulgent eye at the petition
Of one consumed by corresponding ambition,
And lend the helping hand to lift, pulley-hauley;
To Parnassian Peak this poor perspiring Bengalil
Whose ars poetica (as per sample lyric)
Is fully competent to turn out panegyric.
What if sometime to come, perhaps not distant,
You were in urgent need of Deputy-Assistant!
For two Princesses might be confined simultaneously-
Then, how to ºf: the pair extemporaneously?
Or with Nuptial Ode, lack-a-daisy " . What a fix
If with Influenza raging like cat on hot bricks!
In such a wrong §§ will please remember yours truly,
Who can do the needful satisfactorily and duly, -
By an epithalamium (or what not) to inflame your credit
With every coronated head that will have read it!
And the quid pro quo, magnificent and grand, Sir,
Would be at the rate of four annas for every stanza.
Now, thou who scale sidereal paths afar dost,
Diº from thy brilliant boots to cast the superfluous star-dust
pon
The head of him
Whose fate depends
On Thee!
(Signed) BAB00 HURRY BUNGsHo JABBERJEE.
The above was forwarded (post-paid) to Hon'ble AUSTIN's official
address at Poet's Corner, Westminster Abbey (opposite the Royal
Aquarium), but—hoity-toity and mirabile dictuſ-no answer has yet
been vouchsafed to yours truly save the cold shoulder of contemptuous
inattention 1 -
What a pity! Well-a-day, that we should find such passions of
envy and jealousy in bosom of a distinguished poet, whose lucubrated
productions may (for all that is known to the present writer) be no
great shakes after all, and mere food for Pº. -
The British public is an ardent lover of the scintillating jewellery
of fair play, and so I confidently, submit my claims and poetical
compositions to be arbitrated by the unanimous voice of all who
understand such articles. -
Let us remember that it is never too late to pull down the fallen idol
out of the gilded shrine in which it has established itself with the
egotistical isolation of a dog with the mangel
“JUST LIKE HYMN l’”—SIR,-Mr. STEAD is sending circulars
about asking everyone to give him a list of “Hymns that have
helped him.” Personally I am not going to be one of the "Hims
who will help him (Mr. STEAD),” and shall not, if asked, mention the
names of the “Hers that have helped me,” though I have a grateful
remembrance of a nurse and nursery governess, both of whom helped
me uncommonly well at dinner, specially about Christmas time.
They were, however, women equally capable of helping themselves.
Wº: STEAD steadier than ever as he grows older,
I am, yours truly, AVIS SENIOR.

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
ON PAYING BILLs,
... I Haye noticed with deep and genuine regret that in the month of
December there is always a terrible mortality amongst esmen.
Why this should be so I know not. It is not to be su that
tradesmen are, as a class, weaker or more liable to deadly illness than
the rest of their fellow-citizens. Many of them I have met in the
flesh, and they have always struck me as a particularly healthy,
well-clad, strong, comfortable, and energetic §§ of men—not at all
ºsort #. * whomtº would jº § be;:.. their account
unnouseled, disappointed, unanne and, above all, no reckoni
made, by the fogs and chills of December. 1ng
i. But there is no getting out of it: tradesmen do die with an alarm-
ing frequency and suddenness as the end of the year approaches. As
I write, there lie before me four 90mmunications from firms with
whom I have from time to time had dealings which have been, I
|trušt, mutually profitable. Two of these are trimmed with a delicate
little mourning border, the other two are without any external sign
ºf woe, but they all tell the same story: "Dear ir,” says one,
owing to the recent lamented death of Mr. Joshua Trºprºnº
(frºm heart disease) we have found ourselves compelled to callin all
liabilities due to this firm of which he was a member. We beg with
compliments to enclose your valued account amounting to £910s. 4d.,
and shall feel honoured º from you a cheque for same at
your early convenience. Trusting to be favoured with your future
Qommands, and assuring you of our best attention at all times, we beg
tº remain your obedient servants, TENPENNY, Twistºn, & Co.; in
the remaining three the phraseology and the names, of course, vary,
but the distressing purport is the same.
THERR, was something, however, about the document I have
quoted which struck me as having a specially familiar air. I seemed
º: that º * of the same firm had also been

revealed what I had only vaguely remembered. "ß: F.
that, in the short space of five years, five members of this firm an
family had submitted to fate; , In December, 1890, it appeared that

Juniºr, was the next to go, influenza roving fatal to him
in December, 1893. My account then st , as in the previous
º:*.* ; at * . of Mr. HENRY PARKINson
- evidently caused me to omit payment of what I then
owed, and to abstain from further dealings § this death-stricken
firm during the ensuing year. In December, 1894, there was a break.
No TENPENNY died; the TENPENNY plum pudding was not over-
shadowed by calamity, and the TENPENNY Christmas tree, blazing
with festal candles, was surrounded by a joyful and united i.
Another result seems to have been that my account, although,
doubtless, it was rendered, remained unpaid. Obviously, however,
this luck was too good to last, and accordingly in December, 1895, as I
have already said, heart disease struck down Mr. Joshua TENPENNY.
BUT this is not all. I was talking the matter over with a friend
who also deals with TENPENNY, TwistER & Co. He shocked me by
the information that the TwistERs were just as liable to December
deaths as the TENPENNYs. GEORGE, SYDNEY, Nob MAN, ARCHIBALD,
and CHARLEs TwistER, junior, have all died since December, 1890,
of a variety of illnesses and accidents, the most tragic incident, per-
haps, being the fall downstairs, which robbed the world of SYDNEY
TwistER, and the railway collision in Spain which accounted for
CHARLEs TwistER, junior. So close, in any case, is the connection
between the component elements of this firm that no TENPENNY ever
applies for a passage in Charon's ferry unless one of the TwistERs
goes with him to mingle with the lamenting Shades.
IMUST confess that, stated as I have stated it here, the business
begins to wear an ugly and sinister look; I am not at all satisfied
that these respectable fº. came by their deaths in a natural
and lawful manner. am reluctant to say anything which may
cause offence to a body of men whom I cordially respect, but it
does seem to me that these regularly recurring deaths, amounting in
one firm alone to ten since December, 1890, call for a searching
investigation from the police authorities. What if it should be dis-
covered that there exists, by the custom of the trade, in every branch
of business a suicide club with a rule compelling a member of a firm
to kill himself whenever the money owed to the firm exceeds a
certain amount, and another rule authorising the other members to
kill him if he fails to commit suicide within a reasonable time?
Mind, I do not affirm as a fact that such a club exists. At present I
have no sufficient evidence, but I must say that natural causes
appear utterly inadequate to explain the dreadful annual mortality
amongst my unfortunate tradesmen in December.
WITH this exception, there is something dull and prosaic about
bills, when you can pay them, Formerly, of course, in one's under-
graduate days for instance, things were very different, Then the
end of every term brought its own special excitement in the shape of
duns, who ed in person to demand payment of their accounts.
Qne was able to appreciate dimly the feelings of the fox when the
feathering hounds thread through the covert and push him un-
willingly from his lair. . How artfully he slinks and glides amongst
the trees, across the rides, until at last he slips, away, with the
“yoick” of the huntsman ringing in his ears. ith equal art could
the undergraduate mark the approach of the relentless dun and avoid

him. In the end the dun was usually baffled, and the under-
graduate went home light of heart and lighter of pocket, leaving his
sitting-room table littered with bills # as leaves in Wallombrosa,
BUT the day of reckoning, of course, was only deferred. In the
end a stern but forgiving parent was appealed to, and all the bills
were settled. In my time this was ed “going a mucker”;
º the term is still the same. One man I remember used to
pointed out with a certain amount of res awe as having
“gone, a mucker” (i.e., appealed to his father, and had his debts
§ three times in one year. In fact, the payment of one's just
ebts, not by means of one's allowance, but by the interposition of a
parent, was looked upon and spoken of as the very crown of disasters.
And now, there is no going of muckers for most of us... We are
turned into clergymen, barristers, doctors, business-men; two of us
(with one of whom I, moi qui vous parle, have rowed a race in the
same bºat) are bishops; we have wives, families, houses, and we pay
our debts with a sober regularity which seems to preclude the exist-
ence of a past when duns were avoided, and unopened bills were left
to look after themselves... Yet the days of duns and of debt were the
happier, in spite of occasional disaster.
PUNCH TO MR. W. D. HOWELLS.
MY DEAR SIR.—I have been * an article from your pen in
Harper's weekly of January 4. It will give me genuine pleasure if
you will count me henceforth as one of your devoted admirers, your
servant to command in any matter in which it may be possible for
me to º: you. How temperately, how wisely, how humorously,
with how broad and generous a humanity do you write of this diffi-
culty which threatens to set our two peoples, the British and the
American, into hostile camps. “I was greatly stirred the other
day,” you say, “in reading the President's Message concerning the
Venezuela boundary dispute. I did not like his having four relative
pronouns in one sentence towards the close of his message, and upon
the whole the literature struck me as turgid and clumsy, but I
accounted for that by the excitement, he must have been in when he
wrote it, and I felt a responsive thrill, which I took to be a patriotic
emotion, as I read it. . . . . I pictured England reduced by land and
sea to the last extremity through the powers of our º and navy
... and the grass growing in the streets before the offices of the
London newspapers which had noticed my books unfavourably.”
Well, we too have at times experienced that sort of emotion, and
like you, we figure it all so dramatically that we do not fancy our-
selves taking any part personally in the difficult and perhaps dan-
gerous work. e delegate it, as you did, to the poor fellows who are
to fight and bleed, and continue to be poor fellows while we reap the
honour and glory of it. Like you; we imagine our own exemption
from all sorrow and suffering, “and the devotion of the sort of people
who have mostly in all ages of the world been butchered for every
cause, good or bad.” Here, too, are golden words:-
“What I chiefly object to in our patriotic emotion, however, was not that
it was so selfish, but that it was so insensate, so stupid. It took no account
of things infinitely more precious than national honour, such as humanity,
civilisation, and—
‘the long result of time'—
which must suffer in a conflict between peoples like the English and the
Americans. For the sake of having our ships beat their ships, our poor
fellows slaughter their poor fellows, we were #: willing, for one detestable
instant at least, to have the rising hopes of mankind dashed, and the sense
of * brotherhood blunted in the hearts of the foremost peoples of the
world.
But is there, as you say, “in the American heart a hatred of
England, which glutted itself in her imagined disaster and disgrace
when we all read the PRESIDENT's swaggering proclamation, in which
he would not yield to the enemy sofar as even to write good #nglish ?”
Is there to be no forgiveness, are we never to cancel old scores and
begin our international book-keeping, if I may so term it, on a clean
page? I do not think our people hate yours. . Your dash, your pluck,
your humour, your keen common-sense, your breezy and inexhaustible
energy, your strength and broad capacity for government, all these
ualities command and obtain from us a sincere tribute of admiration.
f §. hateus, we must submit to that melancholy condition, but never
mit in such a fashion as to cease from honest effort to abate and
Bul
in the end to remove all hatred. Blood, as one of your naval captains
said on a memorable occasion, is thicker than water. So saying, he
dashed in to the help of our sorely-pressed ships. Let us then call a
truce to petty and malignant carping, and join hands in an alliance
dependent not upon written treaties, but upon the noble sympath
of two great nations engaged in the same work of civilisation an
progress. . You, Sir, s ing for others, I trust, as well as for
yourself, have set us an example. I grasp your hand, and wish you
well in all your undertakings.

goes with him to mingle with the lamenting Shades.
IMUST confess that, stated as I have stated it here, the business
begins to wear an ugly and sinister look; I am not at all satisfied
that these respectable f". came by their deaths in a natural
and lawful manner. am reluctant to say anything which may
cause offence to a body of men whom I cordially respect, but it
does seem to me that these regularly recurring deaths, amounting in
one firm alone to ten since December, 1890, call for a searching
investigation from the police authorities. What if it should be dis-
covered that there exists, by the custom of the trade, in every branch
of business a suicide club with a rule compelling a member of a firm
to kill himself whenever the money owed to the firm exceeds a
certain amount, and another rule authorising the other members tº
kill him if he fails to commit suicide within a reasonable time?
Mind, I do not affirm as a fact that such a club exists. At present I
have no sufficient evidence, but I must say that natural causes
appear utterly inadequate to explain the dreadful annual mortality
amongst my unfortunate tradesmen in December.
WITH this exception, there is something dull and prosaic about
bills, when you can pay them, Formerly, of course, in one's under-
graduate days for instance, things were very different, Then the
end of every term brought its own special excitement in the shape of
duns, who called in person to demand payment of their accounts.
One was able to appreciate dimly the feelings of the fox when the
feathering hounds thread through the covert and push him un-
willingly from his lair. . How artfully he slinks and glides amongst
the trees, across the rides, until at last he slips, away, with the
“yoick” of the huntsman ringing in his ears. ith equal art could

him. In the end the dun was usually baffled, and the under-
graduate went home light of heart and lighter of pocket, leaving his
sitting-room table littered with bills thick as leaves in Wallombrosa,
BUT the day of reckoning, of course, was only deferred..., In, the
end a stern but forgiving parent was º to, and all the bills
were settled. In my time this was ed. “ fº. a mucker”;

pointed out with a certain amount of respectful awe as having

§ three times in one year. In fact, the payment of one's just
ebts, not by means of one's allowance, but by the interposition of a
parent, was looked upon and spoken of as the very crown of disasters.
And now, there is no going of muckers for most of us... We are
turned into clergymen, barristers, doctors, business-men; two of us
(with one of whom I, moi qui vous parle, have rowed a race in the
same boat) are bishops; we have wives, families, houses, and we pay
our debts with a sober regularity which seems to preclude the exist-
ence of a past when duns were avoided, and unopened bills were left
to look after themselves. Yet the days of duns and of debt were the
happier, in spite of occasional disaster.
PUNCH TO MR. W. D. HOWELLS.
MY DEAR SIR,--I have been reading an article from your pen in
Harper's Weekly of January 4. It will give me genuine pleasure if
you will count me henceforth as one of your devoted admirers, your
servant to command in any matter in which it may be possible for
me to º: you. How temperately, how wisely, how humorously,
with how - --
culty which threatens to set our two peoples, the British and the
American, into hostile camps. “I was greatly stirred the other
day,” you say, “in reading the President's Message concerning the
Venezuela boundary dispute. I did not like his having four relative
pronouns in one sentence towards the close of his message, and upon
the whole the literature struck me as turgid and clumsy, but I
accounted for that by the excitement, he must have been in when he
wrote it, and I felt a responsive thrill, which I took to be a patriotic
emotion, as I read it. . . . . I pictured England reduced by land and
sea to the last extremity through the powers of our army and navy
... and the grass growing in the streets before the offices of the
London º: which had noticed my books unfavourably.”
Well, we too have at times experienced that sort of emotion, and
like you, we figure it all so dramatically that we do not fancy our-
selves taking any part personally in the difficult and perhaps dan-
gerous work. º, delegate it, as you did, to the poor fellows who are
to fight and bleed, and continue to be poor fellows while we reap the
honour and glory of it. Like you; we imagine our own exemption
from all sorrow and suffering, “ and the devotion of the sort of people
who have mostly in all ages of the world been butchered for every
cause, good or bad.” Here, too, are golden words:-
“What I chiefly object to in our patriotic emotion, however, was not that
it was so selfish, but that it was so insensate, so stupid. It took no account
of things infinitely more precious than national honour, such as humanity,
civilisation, and—
‘the long result of time'—
which must suffer in a conflict between peoples like the English and the
Americans. For the sake of having our ships beat their ships, our poor
fellows slaughter their poor fellows, we were # willing, for one detestable
instant at least, to have the rising hopes of mankind dashed, and the sense
of * brotherhood blunted in the hearts of the foremost peoples of the
Worlu.
But is there, as you say, “in the American heart a hatred of
England, which glutted itself in her imagined disaster and disgrace
when we all read the PRESIDENT's swaggering proclamation, in which
he would not yield to the enemy sofar as even to write good išnglish?”
Is there to be no forgiveness, are we never to cancel old scores and
begin our international ...; if I may so term it, on a clean
page? I do not think our people hate yours. Your dash, your pluck,
your humour, your keen common-sense, your breezy and inexhaustible
energy, your strength and broad capacity for government, all these
ualities command and obtain from us a sincere tribute of admiration.
f §. hateus, we must submit to that melancholy condition, but never
submit in such a fashion as to cease from honest effort to abate and
in the end to remove all hatred. Blood, as one of your naval captains
said on a memorable occasion, is thicker than water. . So saying, he
dashed in to the help of our sorely-pressed ships, Let us then call a
truce to petty and malignant carping, and join hands in an alliance
dependent not upon written treaties, but upon the noble sympath
of two great nations engaged in the same work of civilisation an
progress. You, Sir, s ing for others, I trust, as well as for
yourself, have set us an example. I grasp your hand, and wish you
well in all your undertakings.

proved victorious in a contest with the Shoreditch Outsiders, I sent
messages of hearty congratulation to the one and sincere condolence to
the other. Delivered another lecture to the "veteran class,” a body

“UNDER WHICH KING” (STREET, ST. JAMES's),
HoPE told a fluttering tale when he wrote his stirringly, highly-
charged Sir-John-Gilbertesquian romance, The Prisoner of Zenda,
Anyone fond of the lighter kind of music united to an extravagant
plot, while reading ANTHONY HoPE's romance, must have seen what a
chance there would have been in it for an opera after the style of
La, Grande Duchesse de Gérolstein, book by MEILHAc and HALÉvy,
and music by the late King of opera-bouffe composers, JAcquEs
OFFENBACH. It needed an OFFFNBACH; for anyone else, English,
French, or German, touching this subject would have found himself
woefully hampered and bothered by Offenbachian memories.
Here are all his characters to

his courtiers, his General Boum-

and a love duet; here are evi- º
dently burlesque imitations of
Wagnerian Qrtrude and Telra-
mond, immediately recognisable
in Antoinette de Mauban and the
Black Michael, fitted with grand
situations for ultra comic duets,
to be taken most seriously: while
in opportunities for solos, trios,
grand choruses, ballets, and spec-
tacular effects, never could libret-
tist's book be richer. There is for
the librettist and composer a per-
fect wealth of material; but for
the playwright, choosing to take
himself and this story seriously,
all that is food for the comic opera
librettist, is, to him, poison.
much for the romance and the
opera-bouffe, the King of Tooriru:
ritania, as it might have been: and
now for the play by Edward Rose,”
the Blooming Rose, as presented
at the St. James's Theatre.
It is in a .* and four Acts. It commences at a quarter to
eight, and is over by, or soon after, eleven...The Prologue is a little
drama in itself; it is admirably played by Mr. GEORGE ALEXANDER
as “the Red Elphege,” of 1733–which sounds like a peculiar wine
of a good vintage year; by Mr. WARING as “the Black, Elphege,”
which sounds a bit like the Original Bones of Christy Minstrelsy,
with a song “The Waring of the Black,” parody upon “ The
Wearing of the Green”; by Mr. CHARLEs, GLENNEY, as the Heav
Husband, who, in company with Miss MABEL HACRNEY (a fres
young actress, in spite of her name), Mr. FEATHERSTONE, Mr. Boy CE,
and Mr. STERNRoyd, struts his short half-hour on the stage, and then
is heard no more. In this Prologue, had Prince Rudolph, or the
husband, been killed, we should have had a complete little one Act
domestic tragedy, a lever du rideau of exceptional merit, well worth
seeing on account of the acting. But those who come in at 8.30 may
comfort, themselves by the assurance that the Prologue they have
missed is not essential to the plot, its incidents being recounted in
about three lines during the progress of the First Act of the play.,,.
And this first Act is excellent. The device by which a “double” is
substituted for Mr. ALExANDER, who, as the moustachioless, tippling
*; topples over on the right-hand side of the stage when, almost
at the same instant, he himself, as Rassendyll, the moustachioed
English tourist, enters on the left, is one of the best deceptions
since Duboscq and Lesurques, the two single gentlemen rolled into
one actor, startled the town. The change is effected with such meat-
ness and precision as to defy detection. The oldest stagers will be
puzzled, and the youngest will scarcely believe their eyes.
In fact, the three first Acts are all as good as they can be; but the
question must arise, what sort of piece are we looking at? Is it not
}. dramatic representation of an extravagant Fº joke, which
the originators are taking with a light heart, and in which the author
has been puzzled, as to how it is to be taken, seriously or not ? If
seriously, then the motive is inadequate, and the st ing tragedy
notes of Miss LILY HAN BURY as the handsome mistress of “the
Black Elphege,” represented by Mr. HERBERT WARING, that double-
dyed black villain, ought to give the tone to the piece; in which case
the merriment of the three#. jokers, Rassendyll, Colonel Sapt
(Mr. W. H. WERNoN), and Fritz (Mr. Royston), is quite out of place.
But, on the contrary, it is the light-hearted gaiety of the conspirators
which carries the audience along and makes “our friends in front”
participators in the jest, thoroughly enj %. the audacious humour
of the situation. It is good fun to see all these magnificently haughty
nobles, the Cardinal Primate, the Lords and Ladies, the representa-

sham King of Ruritania. It gives additional zest to the situation
that Lord Topham, the English Ambassador, capitally played by Mr.
GEORGE BANCROFT (who has quitted the Court (of law) to appear at St.
James's), should be the imposter's uncle, but so blind as not to recog-
nise his nephew. All this is pure extravagant fun.
Princess Flavia should fall in love with the imposter, and he with
her, is all part of “the humour of it.” But that this should ever be
taken seriously-impossible!
When in the last Act is seen the miserable victim of this light-
hearted practical joke, the King, dying in the vault of the castle, the
audience having thoroughly “entered into the humour of the thing,”
tiptoe of expectation for
him to say something at which they
can laugh; but suddenly they find
that “this joke is no joke,” that
what is fun for the boys is death
to the frog, and they discover that
this tragic situation, rendered
still more tragic by Mr. ALF x-
ANDER's forcible acting, is not by
any means in keeping with the
farcical antecedents.
Then when action commences,
when the repentant Antoinette
sympathises with the miserable
monarch, when she has been res-
cued from the objectionable atten-
tions of one ruffian only to fall
into the arms of another, when
there has been a fight to rescue
her, and when the castle has been
taken by storm (that is, by troops
only “heard without”),
everything somehow or another
ought to end happily, then the
author disappoints us, the lovers
are on
poor, deserted Princess Flavia,
the living victim of a prepos-
terous practical joke! And the
audience, after paying just
- - - tribute to the excellence of the
§ away wishing that things had turned out rather
Petits pas
acting,
differen
Now, how ought this practical joke to have ended ? Thus:-The
toper King should have been allowed, like Barnardine, the drunken
convict, to have been spoken of as having drank himself to death;
he should not have been seen at all. The walls should have been
battered down, the successful troops admitted, and Princess Flavia
should have been proclaimed Queen, giving her hand to Rudolf
Rassendyll as Prince Consort. Cheers, triumphant music, tableau,
curtain, and everyone happy.
Of course it is not likely that this suggestion as to excision of
Prologue and re-writing the finish will be acted upon; but had it
been thus, then whatever the present success of this piece may be,
interesting and amusing as it now is, its popularity would have been ||
undisputed, and its run trebled. As it is, it may well be seen and
enjoyed for the acting of all concerned in it; but to ask either actors
or audience to take seriously the characters aiding and abetting so
“comic-opera” a plot, is to demand an impossibility. And thus it
is that anything like real sentiment, acted or ken, is so much
wasted force. This play is one thing, and Mr. HoPE's original romance ||
quite another. In effect, Mr. Rose is “Hope-ing against Hope.”

PUNCH, OR THE
“THE GARDEN THAT I LOVE.”
(New Version.)
THE other morning I was digging up my tulips, and
to think of a rhyme to Clematis Jackmannit-
what an unpoetic namel—when WERONICA brought me a
large letter. Glancing at the envelope, I perceived
that it came from the Lord Chamberlain's office. As
I was anxious to finish my gardening, I exclaimed
“Litera scripta manet,” and continued digging.
“You had better open it,” said WERONICA.
I did so. They wanted another Ode. How tiresome !
I was forced to leave my tulips, and, merely looking at
my Gaillardia grandiflora, Helenium Pumilum, Bryn-
gium ,amethystinum, and Centaurea macrocephela, to
indoors and write. It was a perfect afternoon, at
go
the end of May, and I should have preferred to stay in
the garden that I love, and think of some unofficial verses
to my first Gloire de Dijon rose: , Alas! “Autre temps,
autres vers.” It is all Official Odes now. I only wish
“the Poet” was not a fiction, and then I could turn him
on to the Lord Chamberlain's work. As I sauntered
sadly to the house, I met LAMIA.
“Can you come for a walk?” she asked.
‘. Bheuſ", I answered, speaking to her, in Latin,
as I usually do, which sometimes appears odd, since she
does not understand a word, “IEheu, non ego.! Nunc
semper scribo. Non est omne beerus et skittlet.”
. “Another ode, I suppose...You don't seem very cheerful
since you became Laureate.”
-- no l’” I murmured. “I can say with DANTE,
"Lasciate ogni speranza, voi, ch'entrate.” I get no
time for gardening now.”
“Never mind the Ode. Come and take a walk in the
orehard, and do try to speak English.”
It was a great temptation—I mean the walk. The
weather was perfect; my flowers were delightful; my
Companion was more so.
. “Ah, LAMIA,” I exclaimed; “I use so much English
in the ºfficial odes, that talking Latin is a relief. Tear
I have no time. , ‘Tempt not a desperate man.’ Would
you wish me to defy the Lord Chamberlain?”
I regret to say that she spoke disrespectfully of the
Lord Chamberlain. At times she is frivolous. She said
“Bother him I ?”
“Forgive me,” I ventured to remark, “if I deprecate
such language in reference to my official superior. He
only does his duty. I wish it was not so irksome to me to
do mine. Qnce I could enjoy otium cum dignitate, and
now it is all dignitas with no otium whatever. I begin
to hate poetry.”
“Yes, but this ode can wait,” she said; “you must
come for a walk now.”
“Dear LAMIA,” I exclaimed, “odi et amo”—
“I can †. what that means,” she interrupted; “odes
and something.”
“Not exactly,” I said, “I will teach you the verb amo.
It is a very ** one. Let us begin now, as we walk
in the orchard.”
At that moment WERoNICA brought me a telegram,
from the Lord Chamberlain, as usual. It said, “Please
send immediately poem ordered this morning.” There
was no help for it. LAMIA walked alone. She herself
once said “Love is a literary invention.” On this occa-
sion, at least, literary invention was not love.

laya touched the humour of it?
The Reverend Michael makes the daughter of a humble depen-
and I remember some such case being reported. I suppose," the
Bishop' would have had a word to say to that.” In brief, Parson
Michael, having compelled this modern JANE SHORE in the person of
Rose Gibbard (very prettily played by Miss SARAH Bhooke) to do
public penance, himself falls a victim to the wiles of a gay lady
Audrie Lesden, a married woman, living in single cussedness, and
presumably §: as a widow; a most difficult part, very cleverly
rendered by Miss MARIon TERRY. In fact, throughout, the acting is
excellent; that of Mr. W. MACKINTosh as the tit-for-tatting father
of the doubly victimised girl being º: good.
The gay unattached lady pursues the innocent curate, the mon-
daine she-wolf determined to prey upon the innocent clerical lamb,
to a desert island, most difficult of access and only visited occa-
sionally by excursion steamers, where the reverend gentleman, in
order to devote himself more entirely to his parochial work at
home, has built himself a house containing two cosy bachelor rooms,
one of which is the breadth, height, and half the depth, of the
Lyceum stage; and in this snuggery of Little Michael-all-Alone
suddenly appears Mrs. Audrie Lesden. There is no boat to take
her away: the steamers have gore. They are alone together on the
island. They are in the situation of Helen Rolleston and the
Reverend Robert Penfold in READE and Boucicault's novel, Foul
Play: in the situation, not for weeks or months, but “for one night
only.” There are two separate rooms; and even if there were not,
the Reverend Michael could have said to himself, "Outside, Sir,
outside,” and virtuously, in accordance, with saintly, precedents,
cºuld have walked about till daylight did º: and then, with
his excellent antecedents and an irreproachable reputation in his
favour, he had only to return, tell his simple story, fetch the lady
back, and be believed by all his parishioners. , Isn't that clear?
And it is at this point that I recalled the Rºž of Mr. PENLEY
as the Reverend Robert Spalding (who like the Reverend Michael
“didn't like London”), and wished that he could have been seen by
a delighted public in the awkward predicament of Mr. Jones's
Curate, when (to, quote the title of an old farce with a motive
similar to that of the situation in º Locked ºn with a Lady.
Of course, when the Reverend Mike finds that the lady is a
married woman, and that her husband is on the spot, he forestes
that he may be landed in the Divorce Court. This is undoubtedly
awkward; but it forms no part of the motive, of the play, . Then
he decides upon making a public confession of his guilt, in his own
parish church, before... a congregation assembled to witness the
ceremony of the “dedication.” This ceremony is the occasion of

A REVIEW OF LITERARY FORCES.
At the commencement of the #. the Baron, having ordered out
his Literary Forces and reviewed his noble shelves, issues this General
Order:—"I am struck with admiration for the º: of what I
may term the utility business in the publishing, not only of novels, but
of all kinds of valuable literature. Thave passed in review a splendid
force of the ‘Charles Kingsley's Own,” organised and commanded
by General MACMILLAN ; while under General WABD, Colonel Lock,
and other distinguished officers appears a regiment, not the less
valuable because showy, of ‘Henry Kingsley's Light Horse.’ The
• True Blues, or Charlotte Yonge Forces, make a fine display in the
service of the MACMILLAN Company. The “William Black Watch?

slalled in order by Lieut.-Col. SAMPson Low, who personally leads

all the regiments of volumes most serviceable for campaigning com-
mend me,” $. the Baron, “to the Picked “Pocket Wolume
Regiments.’ ey form a small, compact army in themselves, excel-
lently officered, ready for outpost, skirmishing, sharpshooting, and
any handy duties which heavier-weighted volumes could not perform.
At the head, in deep red, with gold ornamentation on their backs, and
light blue silken bookmarkers for colours, *::::::::::: the motto
*Non Sansl)roict,' comes the ‘TempleShakspeare Regiment'; perfect
type; excellent notes; ready to travel anywhere; always handy by
road, river, or rail, never in the way, brought into the field of prac-
tical itinerary study by Colonel DENT of Aldine House, with invalu-
able texted weapons from the Cantabrigian armouries of Messrs.
MACMILIAN and ALDIs WRIGHT. Let the attention of all who love
their SBAKSPEARE handy, and who are contented to travel about with
one play at a time, turn their attention to this most useful series.
“Then march along, in a long line, the “Dark Blue Guards,” or
‘Literary Household Brigade,’ started by CASSELL & Co., a gallant
corps that admits volunteers from all regions of literature into its
ranks, so that their range of marksmanry is world-wide, co-extensive
with British Rule, and therefore might well bear the title of “The
within an eighth of an inch as pocketable as the Shakspearian Regi-
ment aforesaid. And what names are to be found on these regi-
mental lists? MACAULAY, Dick ENs, SILVIo PELLICO, LA MoTTE

(with, of course, directions how to play it), STEELE, and ADDISON.
Then FRANKLIN, Swift, with BUNYAN (enough to make, Swift

which ask for MoRE (Sir Thomas), and see that you get it." There's
a picture for you!’ And the J. sixpence each in cloth; three-
pence in paper; which, with the usual discount for cash, means
thirty volumes for half a sºvereign; and of such a whole sovereign

of General Public, on the March of Intellect to join forces with
General Knowledge. They dº file pest, salute, and are saluted.in
turn most heartily by ** F. M. THE BARON.”
ARCHAEological MEM.–Great discoveries are coming to light as
regards the Chapel of the Rolls. No doubt the Buttresses will spon
be found... Its architectural construction would have been im rfect
without these, which would have constituted it The Rolls and
Butteresses Chapel. Here a full dole of rolls and butter was given
to every unbreakfasted, applicant. , In, Wagge's Ancient History;
advertised as “Jest out,” it is recorded how there was “one Chapill
of the Hot Rolls and Butteresses; and how after a ‘full dole’ he
became ‘dole-ful.’”

A REVIEW OF LITERARY FORCES.
At the commencement of the #. the Baron, having ordered out
his Literary Forces and reviewed his noble shelves, issues this General
Order:—“I am struck with admiration for the development of what I
may term the utility business in the publishing, not only of novels, but
of all kinds of valuable literature. I have passed in review a splendid
force of the ‘Charles Kingsley's Own,” organised and commanded
by General MACMILLAN ; while under General WABD, Colonel Lock,
and other distinguished officers appears a regiment, not the less
valuable because showy, of “Henry Kingsley's Light Horse.” . The
True Blues, or Charlotte Yonge Forces, make a fine display in the
service of the MACMILLAN Company. The “William Black Watch'
march past with a breezy step to the tune of “Far Lochaber,’ and
wearing their Three Feathers, with One White One. They are mar-
slalled in order by Lieut.-Col. S \MPson Low, who Fº leads
that fine body of Horse Marin, s, the ‘Clark Russell Rovers.' But of
all the regiments of volumes most serviceable for campaigning com-
mend me,” §. the Baron, “to the Picked “Pocket Wolume
Regiments.’ ey form a small, compact army in themselves, excel-
lently officered, ready for outpost, skirmishing, sharpshooting, and
any handy duties which heavier-weighted volumes could not perform,
At the head, in deep red, with gold ornamentation on their backs, and
light blue silken bookmarkers for colours, bearing proudly the motto
“Non SansL)roict,’ comes the ‘TempleShakspeare Regiment'; perfect
type; excellent notes; ready to travel anywhere; always handy by
road, river, or rail, never in the way, brought into the field of prac-
tical itinerary study by Colonel DENT of Aldine House, with invalu-
able texted weapons from the Cantabrigian armouries of Messrs.
MACMILIAN and ALDIs WRIGHT. Let the attention of all who love
their SHAKSPEARE handy, and who are contented to travel about with
one play at a time, turn their attention to this most useful series.
“Then march along, in a long line, the “Dark Blue Guards,” or
“Literary Household Brigade,’ started by CASSELL & Co., a gallant
corps that admits volunteers from all regions of literature into its
ranks, so that their range of marksmanry is world-wide, co-extensive
with British Rule, and therefore might well bear the title of ‘The
within an eighth of an inch as pocketable as the Shakspearian Regi-
ment aforesaid. And what names are to be found on these regi-
mental lists? MacAULAY, Dickens, SILVIo PELLICO, LA MoTTE
FouquE, PLUTARCH, Boccaccio, WASHINGTON, IRVING, MARco Polo
(with, of course, directions how to play it), STEELE, and ADDISON.
Then FRANKLIN, Swift, with BUNYAN (enough to make. SWIFT
limp), XENOPhon, and Bâcon (a real literary dish, as a treat), after
which ask for MoRE (Sir THoMAs), and see that you get it..." There's
a picture for you!’ And the J. sixpence each in cloth; three-
pence in paper; which, with the usual discount for cash, means
thirty volumes for half a sovereign; and of such a whole sovereign
reigning over Utopia might be proud. All these are at the command
of General Public, on the March of Intellect to join forces with
General Knowledge. They d file pest, salute, and are saluted, in
turn most heartily by ** F. M. THE BARON.”
ARchA:ological MEM.–Great discoveries are coming to light as
regards the Chapel of the Rolls. No doubt the Buttresses will soon
be found. Its architectural construction would have been imperfect
without these, which would have constituted it The Rolls and
Butteresses Chapel. Here a full dole of rolls and butter was given
to every unbreakfasted, applicant. , In, Wagge's Ancient. Historiº
advertised as “Jest out,” it is recorded how there was “one Chapill
of the Hot Rolls and Butteresses; and how after a ‘full dole’ he
became “dole-ful.’”

THE
CONDENSED CONFIDENCE.
(A Let'er for Ladies.)
MY DEAR ETHELINDA, -We have been quite gay this week. Aunt
JEMIMA gave a Cinderella on Tuesday, and all our friends assembled
in great force. There were some novel, and becoming dresses... I
especially noticed a sweet harmony in yellow and green chiffon, the
skirt being caught up with bunches of real Mandarin oranges. The
wearer was a young Countess, whose portrait was rejected at the
Academy the year before last. A pretty, sallow girl, with a nose
rather too prononcé, was gowned in brick-dust bigogne, the ceinture
of Marie Thérèse blue, with a short fluted basque of gamboge. She
wore Spanish chestnuts in the prickly pod arranged as a bouquet, and
the ensemble was quite too perfect. Very striking, too, was a
costume...of toad-brown velvet, the broad éréque, empire corsage
terminating with a sharp grand monarque point, fastening on the
right side with a cluster of marigolds, d $ii. and forget-me-nots.
Qn Wednesday EBMyNTRUDE and fwent to Lady CALLIPER's ball.
A Russian Princess created quite a sensation by appearing in a black
satin cosaque, embroidered in gold, and ornamented with malachite
chains. I confess that the arrangement seemed to me somewhat
outré, and not to be compared to the Duchess of BRIGHToN's creation
of peat-coloured Patagonian tulle cut a labelle Margot, with revers
en cascade of Honiton lace and endless, wreaths of bottle-green
carnations. On Thursday Uncle NoLL, took us to the New Gallery
where. I came across two very original toques, one being formed o
the skin of a Tweed salmon with the scales perfectly preserved, the
entourage being artificial flies; the other constructed of marmoset fur
with the head, in front en lion, the eyes being emeralds, while the
tail of the monkey was brought over the left shoulder á l'Impératrice
and terminated with a wee crystal watch. Uncle NoLL #. us feel
very uncomfortable by repeatedly asking where the show of Spanish
liquorice could be found.
On Friday we had to get some presents for ANGELINA's birthday,
and at CutpuBSE AND DUyAL's I found such a delightful blotting:
book, made of Thibet beech—a rich red wood, very like mahogany.
The charm of the thing is that, directly the §. is opened, out
!. a grand lama (the inkstand) with a penholder in his mouth,
ready for use. ERMYNTRUDE bought a silver-guilt tortoise, which,

CHARLEY asked me to get him a gift as well (the poor fellow is
working night and day on a starvation salary at the Colonial Office);
so we went to Rollick AND RASPER's, where, after giving a great
deal of trouble to the very gentlemanlike young men who serve, we
selected a very useful article—an umbrella, with a handle holding a
knife, fork, spoon, and toothpick, all in silver. One of the young
men who waited on us is so like the Duke of PIMLIco, but perhaps
more distingué. Naughty E. says, “Noblesse oblige.”
Last night we had a box at the Adelphi, and thought that
Mr. TFRRiss, in his kilt, was very like his daughter ELLALINE, whose
photograph I, sent you as a Christmas card. We could not help
clapping our hands at the patriotic speeches, just to, show, hºw we
hated the Boers, though, to be sure, the play is all abºut Egypt.
Mais, ma mie la patrie toujours la patrie, Here is a good recipe for
luncheon. Take # a dozen eggs, a pot of caviare, and the insides

Then add an ounce of cinnamon, two pickled walnuts, and three
nutmegs. Meantime stew a bladebone of beef with a pound of Peri-
goid truffles and a bottle of champagne. Mingle the contents of
the two casseroles together, boil, and serve with slices of French

in great force. There were some novel, and becoming dresses... I
especially noticed a sweet harmony in yellow and green chiffon, the
skirt being caught up with bunches of real Mandarin oranges. The
wearer was a young Countess, whose portrait was rejected at the
Academy the year before last. A pretty, sallow girl, with a nose
rather too prononcé, was gowned in brick-dust bigogne, the ceinture
of Marie Thérèse blue, with a short fluted basque of gamboge. She
wore Spanish chestnuts in the prickly pod arranged as a bouquet, and
the ensemble was quite too perfect. Very striking, too, was a
costume of toad-brown velvet, the broad Téréque empire corsage
terminating with a sharp grand monarque point, fastening on the
right side with a cluster of marigolds ś and forget-me-nots.
On Wednesday EbmyNTRUDE and fwent to Lady CALLIPER's ball.
A Russian Princess created quite a sensation by appearing in a black
satin cosaque, embroidered in gold, and ornamented with malachite
chains. I confess that the arrangement seemed to me somewhat
outré, and not to be compared to the Duchess of BRIGHToN's creation
of peat-coloured Patagonian tulle cut a la belle Margot, with rerers
en cascade of Honiton lace and endless wreaths of bottle-green
carnations. On Thursday Uncle NoLL, took us to the New Gallery
where. I came across two very original toques, one being formed o
the skin of a Tweed salmon with the scales perfectly preserved, the
entourage being artificial flies; the other constructed of marmoset fur
with the head in front en lion, the eyes being emeralds, while the
tail of the monkey was brought over the left shoulderd l'Impératrice
and terminated with a wee crystal watch. Uncle NoLL made us fee
very uncomfortable by repeatedly asking where the show of Spanish
liquorice could be found.
Qn Friday we had to get some presents for ANGELINA's birthday,
and at CutpuRSF.AND, Dryat's I found such a delightful blotting:
book, made of Thibet beech—a rich red wood, very like mahogany.
The charm of the thing is that, directly the book is opened, out
jumps a grand lama (the inkstand) with a penholder in his mouth,
y for use. ERMYNTRUDE bought a silver-guilt tortoise, which,
CHARLEY asked me to get him a gift as well (the poor fellow is
working night and day on a starvation salary at the Colonial Office);
so we went to Rollick AND RASPER's, where, after giving a great
deal of trouble to the very gentlemanlike young men who serve, we
selected a very useful article—an umbrella, with a handle holding a
knife, fork, spoon, and toothpick, all in silver. One of the young
men who waited on us is so like the Duke of PIMLIgo, but perhaps
more distingué. Nsº E. says, “Noblesse oblige.”
Last night we had a box at the Adelphi, and thought that
Mr. TERRiss, in his kilt, was very like his daughter ELLALINE, whose
photograph I sent you as a Christmas card. We could not help
clapping our hands at the patriotic speeches, just to, show, how we
hated the Boers, though, to be sure, the play is all abºut Egypt.

goid truffles and a bottle of champagne. Mingle the contents of

the drawing-room sofa, while KATE read aloud
the first Hiſt of aromantic novel in the newest
fashionable quarterly, entitled, The Savoy
which ALPHonse the doubtful had. procured
from the library that very morning. . . .
KATE read on:—
"Before a toilet that shone like the Altar of
Nôtre Dame des Victoires, Helen was seated
in a little dressing-gown of black and helio-
trope. The coiffeur Cosmé was caring for her
scented chevelure, and with tiny silver tongs,
tearm from the caresses of the flame, made
delicious intelligent curls, that fell as lightly
as a breath about her forehead and over her
eyebrows, and clustered like tendrils round
her neck. Her three favourite girls, Pappe-
larde, Blanchemains and Loreyne, waited
immediately upon her with perfume and
powder in delicate flaºons ºf frail casso-
lettes, and held in porcelain jars the ravishing
paints prepared by Châteline for those cheeks
and lips that had grown a little pale with
anguish of erile. . . . Millamant held a slight
tray of slippers, Minette some tender gloves,
La Popelinière-mistress of the robes-was
ready with a#.” of yellow and yellow, La
Zambinella bore the jewels, Florizel some
flowers, Amadour a bor of various pins, and
Vadius a box of sweets. . . .
“‘Cosmé,” said Helen, “ you have been
quite sweet and quite brilliant, you have sur-
passed yourself to-night.”
''' Madame flatters me,’ replied the antique
old thing, with a girlish giggle under his black
satin mask. . . .
“Helen slippedawaythedressing-gown, rose
before the mirror in a flutter of frilled things,
and called Millamant to bring her the slippers.
“The tray was freighted with the most ex-
quisite and shapely pantowfles, sufficient to
make Cluny a place of naught. There were
shoes ºf grey and black and brown suéde, of
white silk and rose satin, and velvet and
sarcenet; there were some of seagreen sewn
with cherry blossoms, some of red with willow
branches, and some of grey, with bright-
winged birds. There were heels of silver, of
ivory, and of gilt ; there were buttons so
beautiful that the buttonholes might have no
pleasure till they closed upon them; there
were soles of delicate leathers scented with
maréchale, and linings of soft stuffs scented
with the juice of July flowers. But Helen,
finding none of them to her mind, called for a
discarded pair of blood-red maroquin, dia-
pered with pearls. These looked very dis-
tinguished orer her white silk stockings.
“Meantime, La Popelinière stepped for-
ward with the frock.
“‘Ishan't wear one to-night,” said Helen.
Then she slipped on her gloves.”
“Oh, charming !” interrupted KATE's
patroness, who was sometimes taken literary.
“Poetic, really. Read that description again,

KATE complied.
“Sweet, indeed!” said Mrs. WITITTERLY,
with a sigh. “So voluptuous, is it not? So

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
STRAINED RELATIONS IN THE KENNEL.
I AM beginning to experience some of the uncomfortable results of
educating my dogs up to the Spectator standard, and, in order that
others may take warning ere it is too late, I propose to set down
a brief history of what has happened during the past week amongst
the highly-intelligent dogs who have kindly agreed to share with me
my humble dwelling, and to leave for my use one or two of the most
uncomfortable chairs to be found in it. "I need scarcely say that the
sofas and armchairs have long ago been recognised as the exclusive | D
property of the dogs.
Of course, everybody knows that if dogs are only allowed to live
...; enough in the society of human beings, they eventually reach
such a high pitch of intelligence that they begin to feel the want of
speech. The scope of their feelings, their desires, and their thoughts
becomes enlarged, and they yearn for some more accurate medium of
expression than is afforded by barking, tail-wagging, or cratching
at a door, eloquent as these may sometimes be made. "(Has anybody,
by the way, ever owned a dog who did not constantly post himself on
the wrong side of a door? A considerable part of my life is spent in
getting up and opening doors for dogs. No matter, how carefully I
may inveigle the dogs into a room, the result is always the same.
In the space of five minutes after I have sat down and composed
myself every dog will, by some magic means, have vanished, and a
furious scratching or a melancholy whining will announce that the
all wish to come back again. So when I have left the house wi
apparently the whole pack, a few seconds afterwards the vision of
two or three excited dog-faces at the garden-window, and a series of
agonised ululations will prove to me that some of them must have
run back at the last moment-probably to fetch whatever is the canine
equivalent of a handkerchief or a matchbox. This, however, as I
have said, is by the way.)
Dogs, then, understanding more or less what is said to them, and
recognising in speech the best method of expression, begin, after a
time, to want to be able to speak. Fortunately I have managed, to
some extent, as I explained some weeks ago, to gratify this wish by
means of the Canine Cogitatograph, or thought-register, adapted to
dogs of all breeds and sizes. A curious indirect result of this con-
show, are able not only to communicate their thoughts to me,
but also to understand much more plainly all that I say, and to
converse with one another with far greater force and variety than
before. They are, in fact, becoming too human, and I am afraid
I shall have to part with them. When I acquired them I looked for
the companionship of real dogs, not of human beings disguised with
four legs, tails, and fur coats.
I MUST explain again that my pack numbers five. There is
Nellie, the deerhound, whose virtues I need not further describe, as
she plays no part in the story I am about to tell. Then there are
on and Roy, the two St. Bernards, aged about twenty months.
Don is an enormous animal, not yet fully developed, but weighing
already eleven stone, and measuring very close on thirty-three
inches at the shoulder. He is the kindest and best-tempered dog in
the whole world, one huge lump of affectionate good nature. His
brother Roy is a smaller, but perhaps a handsomer dog. His head
is broader, his nose shorter, his body more compact, and his limbs,
on the whole, better knit together. He is a dog of immense strength,
and of a wild, teasing, º disposition, rather shy with strangers,
but very affectionate with his intimates. I think the soul of some
high-spirited, clever, mischievous undergraduate has found its incar-
nation in Roy. There are deep wrinkles on his forehead, and over
his eyes that give his face a peculiar whimsical and pathetic expres-
sion. He has a great admiration and liking for the butcher, but,
oddly enough, pursues the butcher's cart up the lane with a relent-
less animosity which is apt to terrify quiet people who meet him on
one of these razzias. Both these dogs adore children; and it is a
comical sight to see them standing one on each side of a youngster of
five, and all but lifting him into the air as they lick his face with
their great tongues. One other point about them deserves, mention,
They overflow with sympathy. You have only to sit down and
pretend to cry or to be in pain to have them rushing across the room
with howls, upsetting chairs or tables as they come, until they can
smother you under an avalanche of clumsy caresses.
BEN, the retriever, is a quiet dog, devoted to his profession and
very intelligent, a dog with º eloquent eyes, and a lustrous, wavy
black coat. Rufus, the spaniel, is a brown dog, and supplies un-
consciously the comic element in the kennel. He has the most
absurd way of gazing at you with his bulging, amber eyes, while he












trivance has been, however, that my 'dogs, as the sequel will
wags his stump of a tail at the rate of about a million to the minute.

48 PUNCH, OR THE
He is very affectionate and very jealous; a pat or a kind word to
one of the other dogs is enough to arouse Rufus from the deepest
slumber in order that he may at once claim his share of attention.
He is also rather masterful, and being comparatively a little dog
he is apt to resent the rough, good-humoured gambols of the St.
Bernards. He is deeply convinced that he is superior to the whole
of the rest of them put together.
Now I noticed during the last few days that Rufus has been
employing his leisure in burying odd biscuits and stray bones in
various parts of the garden. For instance, when I gave him a
biscuit the other day, instead of eagerly scrunching it as is his
custom, he kept it in his mouth, and looked at me with a con-
toious, half-guilty expression, wagging his tail furiously all the
time. º; the dictates of good breeding, I withdrew, but not
far enough to lose sight of Rufus, although I made sure that he
was unable to see me. Having waited a short time he trotted off
to a convenient flower-bed, and began to scrape a hole. In this
he carefully deposited his biscuit and then set to work to rub
the earth back with his broad and foolish brown nose. Having
carefully smoothed the place all over he came back to me looking
as if nothing had happenid, though his tell-tale nose had upon
it a pyramid of earth quite an inch high. It may be thought
that Rufus buried these scraps of food in order to have a stºre
for future emergencies. , Not at all. I discovered tha', to use
his own expression, he had been “pegging out, claims” in the
garden, and by this time he imagines himself to have proprietary
rights over the whole place.
WE have, of course, all been very much excited by the foreign
intelligence of the º few weeks, and the other morning. while
Rufus was apparently sleeping, someone read out alond the German
Emperor's extraordinary telegram to President Khüger. Rufus
took nonotice at the time, but, as the result shows, he had evidently
heard, been fired with admiration, and had resolved on the first
opportunity to imitate. After lunch on the same day, Ben had
retired to smoke a quiet bone in a corner of the garden that he
particularly affects. Roy, who is. I am sorry to say, rather agreedy
dog, observed the bone from a distance, and the waters of desire
began to trickle from his mouth. He decided to make an attempt
to possess himself of it. Ben, however, who had temporarily de-
posited his bone, was fully aware of what was passing in Roy's mind,
and accordingly when Roy advanced, looking as if he had .
business totally unconnected withabonein that cornerof the garden,
Ben sprang up, and seized the invader by the ear. So resolute was
the retriever's demeanour that Roy, oppressed with a sense of
knavery, incontinently turned and fled. Here was Rufus's oppor-

tunity. That remarkable dog approached to within ten yards of Ben,
looked at him steadily, harked twice, and then retired. This was what
he had said; I readitoff immediately on the Cogitatograph: “I con-
gratulate you with all my heart on having repulsed dastardly inva-
sion of Rob-roy, freebooter, without the intervention of any friendly
powers. (Signed) Rufus, R. & I.” Ben had made a suitable reply to
the effect that he would defend the independence of his beloved bone
to his last gasp.
The consequences of this, ridiculous action on Rufus's part are
very distressing. Roy and Don, who had of course heard the
message delivered, are both furious. Don says that he is far from
wishing to defend every action that Roy may take, but after all,
blood is thicker than water, and he is not º to endure the pre-
posterous airs of a bandy-legged upstart, like, Rufus. . Ben is not
too pleased. He says he can defend himself without the intervention
of anybody, and has no intention of being patronised by Rufus. In
fact, that unfortunate spaniel is at the present moment the most
unpopular dog I have ever known, and all on account of a moment's
rashness inspired by hearing the Emperor's telegram read aloud. I
have had to give Rufus a room to himself, and to keep him carefully
out of the way of the St. Bernards. I scarcely like to think what
the end of it all may be.

members of the Junior Bar. -

Messrs BRIEFLEss, DUNUP, Roe, DoE, and JUSTINIAN Cockburn, for
the defendant.
The Judge (courteously). I do not wish to interfere at so early a
stage. But I would suggest to learned counsel wearing silk, that
there seems to me rather an excessive use of stuff in this matter.
First Leader (smiling). I take your Lordship's meaning. But I
would humbly suggest that in the course of my case I shall have to
show a prize fight, when, for the purpose of illustration, I shall find
the services of my friends who are associated with me invaluable.
Many of my friends when at Cambridge were distinguished members
of the A. D. C. -
The Judge. Quite so. Of course you will use your discretion.
Second Leader. And as the matter has been, mentioned, my Lord,
I think it is only right to say that, as during the course of this case
[...shall have to show how a game of Nap was played, I cannot
dispense with the services of my friends. I may mention that Mr.
BRIEFLEss (whose face may possibly be better known to your
Lordship than his voice) is a very clever amateur actor. During the
last twenty or thirty years he has been giving readings of Hamlet and
Dazzle, absolutely distinct from those made familiar to the public by
Sir HENRY IRVING and the late Mr. CHARLEs MATHEws. -
The Judge. I have not the least doubt of Mr. BRIEFLEss's ability
but I wou'd point out that, as a rule, a Queen's Counsel is satisfied
with the assistance of (at most) two members of the Junior Bar.
First Leader. Just so, my Lord. But no doubt it will be fresh in
your Lordship's memory that recently Mr. Avoby showed how a
suicide or murder might be committed in a cab with the assistance
of his learned friend Mr. BIRoN." Now I would not for a moment
suggest that the great dearth of business in these courts has
anything to do with the matter, but it is undoubtedly open to obser-
vation that certainly anything that can be done to put business-
The Judge (interrupting). Yes, yes; I understand. But I am
afraid that the matter may end in disappointment. But that is a
point that the Taxing Master must decide.

I.—MYSTERIES OF THE HUMAN HEART,
Is the world coming round to my point of view after all, and is the
great heart of the nation beginning to recognise that what interests
me must be the most important factor in life? Here is a charming
magazine, written by contributors who have the full courage of their
woman's creed, and very refreshing it is to turn from the morbid
philosophy of the Besantine school of literature to the sweet fresh air
of the new world to which Mr. WEIRDSLEY and his colleagues take
us, There is not an article in the volume that one can put down
without feeling the better and the purer for it.
II.-AN IDYLL OF THE SEASIDE.
I have neither fear nor shame in printing the following extract
from a breezy article by the editor.
Margate, 1895. By Simple Symons.
I went to Margate this year by the excursion-train with the intention of
remaining only for the eight hours of vulgarity without fun that we trippers
are promised, and I remained from º till Monday! What is it in
this so little watering-place that appeals to the poet, and that turns us all,
at our moments, into helpless and drivelling idiots?...
Äht but the beach on . sunny morning I What a feast of colour, of move-
ment, of so various curiosities! Here is the smart brandy-ball man with his
paper cap, here the quaint seller of old-world pebbles. On certain mornings
negro minstrels perform on the sands. You cannot imagine anything more
delicious. These, it should be said, are not real negroes; they are simply ordi-
nary whitemen, with their faces painted black. How amusingit all was, how
interesting they were, how they invited to the wandering of vague emotion!
I had my own little romance on the beach—the most absurd ºf little
romances. Still 1
There was an old bathing-woman, known as MARTHA GUNN. . She
avoided me in so marked a manner that I saw she was in love with me.
Once, when I smiled at her, she waved at me, as in mock defiance, a little,
teeny bathing-dress. Sometimes she would sit on the steps of a bathing
machine, knitting. I thought once of kissing my hand to her. But, after
all, was it worth while? Yet it would have pleased her, my dear old friend,
whom I never knew, but who, I knew, loved me. More than all others,
MARTHAGUNN seemed to sum up Margate for me. . . .
This plaintive philosophy will come home to many as a revelation
and a hope.
III.-UNEASY LIES THE HEAD THAT WEARS A CROWN.
The article from which I subjoin an extract, and which is deepl
interesting in the present political crisis, will, Iventure to think, #

A. To be sure. But then it
must be remembered thatsongs
are harmless until their words
cease to be syllables and be-
come deeds.
Q. Then, in spite of spirited
leading articles and Jingo
minstrelsy, you, would act

A. Yes, as represented by
the Government.
Q. And you would prefer
rumours of war to war itself?
A. Naturally; for theformer

Q. But, supposing that it

sideration—after taking into
account the possibility of

securing the remainder of the

seemed likely that war might

would have come within the

A Fine Child. By Maz Mereboom.
I first saw him last summer, in the Isle of Wight, clapping his chubby
little hands, and crowing with delight as he sailed his toy-ship. A fine child
he is, fond of his rocking-horse, fonder still of playing with soldiers. For
the rest, I find but one slight stain on his infant life. He is a trifle
quarrelsome, and, when other children fight, he will run and kiss the victor,
or hit the vanquished with his clenched fist. Once he locked his little brother
up in a cupboard for doing something that displeased him. He prefers sauer-
Kraut even to Mellin's food, and dearly loves a musical box that plays “Die
Wacht am Rhein.” He cannot bear to leave his toy-boats at home. He
cries when he goes out, and says to his nurse “Kleine Billie wants Schiffe.”
He is perhaps a trifle spoilt. He should be, while there is yet time, placed
judiciously in the corner, or deprived, it may be, of pudding. Ein wenig
Gedu'd l He may yet grow up to be a great and good man.
IV.-The MoRAL TONE,
And now we come to Mr. WEIRDSLEY's work, Under Ludgate
Hill is a novel rather of character than of adventure. It is chiefly
remarkable for its terse, vigorous style, its absolute truthfulness to
nature, and—more important than all the rest—its high moral tone.
The character of the excellent Mrs. Marsuple is superbly developed,
while Claud and Clair are creations—they seem to live. This book
should be on every schoolroom table; every mother should present it
to her daughter, for it is bound to have an ennobling and purifying
influence. Here is a powerful description of the refreshment-bar of
Messrs. SPIERs AND POND:—
. . . . The refreshment-table was freighted with the most exquisite and
shapely delicacies, sufficient to make Buzzards' a place of naught. On quaint
pedestals of every sort stood bottles of cherry-brandy, of gingerbeer, of lime-
juice cordial. Marmalade and jam were infrail porcelain pots. There were jam-
tarts that seemed to stain the table, bath-buns baked to the utmost, and flecked
with tiny dead flies, macaroons of all sorts, and sandwiches cut like artificial

into cunning forms, and sausage-rolls so beautiful that the teeth might have
no pleasure until they closed upon them. ... Some of the barmaids had put
on delightful little fringes dyed in reds, and i. and some wore great
white aprons after the manner of the New Magdalen. They were silenced
by the approach of the Bovril, that was served by waiters dressed in black.

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
THE ALARMs of MoTHERs.
DURING the past ten days or so, the mothers of Great Britain have
been bidding good-bye to their beloved sons. To Oxford and Cam-
bridge, to Trinity College, Dublin, to Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Fettes
Loretto, and countless other schools with great reputations and
varying charges for board (gymnastics, French, German, drawing,
and music, being extras of unfortunately doubtful popularity), the
sons have betaken themselves, many with hampers, and with
good advice from both parents. To the father it pertains to urge his
son tº greater mental activity, to warn him as to the crushing effects
in after life of failure in examinations, to inculcate punctuality,
obedience, and (in the case of undergraduates) a discreet manage-
mºnt ºf his finances. The mother, on the other hand, concernsher-
self with his bodily welfare. She provides him with a hamper, she
i. him not to catch cold, she is eloquent on the subject of dry
Boºks and flannel underwear, she begs him to avoid the terrible
fatigues involved in º: boat-races, and the inevitable danger
to life and limb entailed by football. “Your grandfather,” she
says, “neyer played football, and he is vigorous and healthy at the
age of eighty.” The logical inference is of course obvious: abstain
from football, and you will live to be a vigorous and healthy octo-
genarian. But sons, like all other males, are hopelessly illogical.
HERE, I think, I may indulge myself with a short by-the-way on
the subject of hampers. Yesterday my advice was sought by a small
friend who was about to return to the house of toil. He was pro-
ceeding with his even more diminutive brother in the direction of the
yillage grocer, in order to buy something for the terminal hamper,
but he wished to know how best to emplºy the money intrusted to
him by his mother for that purpose. “What do you think of
oranges?” he asked... I suggested that oranges were a cold fruit at
this time of year. . "But you can take 'em to bed, you know, and
warm them up a bit first. Besides,” he continued, “you can
make pigs out of orange peel, and put them on the French master's
desk; and you can make spiffing sets of false teeth.” This settled
the matter; a dozen oranges were decided on. “Any jam P' I
asked. “Rather. Two pºts of apricot, three pots of strawgºgs and
three pots of goosegogs.” “What about potted shrimps? 'i'in-
quired, “Qh my, of course we'll have potted shrimps, won't we,
DICK ?” DICK's eyes glistened; enthusiasm burst from every
feature. “Chuck her up for potted shrimps,” he remarked, in a
tone of deep conviction. “A cake?” I hinted. “Oh, we’ve got a
cake ready at home, a reg'lar whopper, full of currants.” A few
minutes later the necessary, purchases were concluded, two dozen
macaroons being added at the last moment, and the heavily loaded
foraging column staggered homeward in triumph with its booty.
To return to the subject of mothers. I once had the privilege of
staying at home with a Y. massive and powerful heavy-weight
oarsman, whose strength and stamina in the University boat-race
had been universally admired. In accepting his mother's invitation
I had permitted myself a jocose allusion to the pleasure I should fºe
in being able to watch over her young Titan's restoration, to, health
after the labours of the race. “Dear HARRY,” I wrote, “will want
a rest; his delicate frame requires plenty of wholesome food, and it
will be well for him, I am sure, to continue to go to bed early so as
to get as much sleep as possible every night. I will do my best
while I stay with you to persuade him to take very great care of
himself.” hen I arrived I was welcomed as though I had been a
prophet by HARRY's mother: “You are the only one of HARRY's
friends,” said that dear lady to me, “who sees that HARRY is over-
doing is dreadful rowing. He looks strong, I know, but in
reality he is delicate and terribly liable to colds. Have you ever
seen him in, one of his fits of sneezing?, They are most severe, and
seem to shake him to pieces. Of course, he is wilful, and refuses to
listen to his mother, but now that I have your influence to support
me, perhaps he will be a little more reasonable.” in fact, I dis-
covered that this picked specimen of health, strength, and endurance
was considered by his dear mother to be a frail and delicate plat
requiring constant care and attention. I never had so much
difficulty in making my peace with anyone as I had with HARRY
when he discovered what I had done in a moment of ill-timed levity.
HERE, too, is a letter from a mother to her son who was travelling
on the Continent:—
MY DARLINg Boy, I am thankful to hear ł. have arrived safe
and sound with dear WILLY. Ever since you left frightful disasters
have been before my mind. First of all there was a short telegram
in the papers announcing a train wrecked (the very day you were
travelling) between Abbeville, and somewhere else. course, I
pictured you and WILLY buried beneath horrible splinters, with the
engine slowly setting fire to you both, and no means of escape,
except by axes that might hack off your arms and legs before the
doctors arrived. As no further accounts of the disaster followed I
began to be easy, although I had already imparted such fearful and
sinister forebodings to my cook that she was evidently, quite
certain you were in that train, and must have been deeply dis-
appointed by your card yesterday morning announcing your safe

arrival at Madrid. Still, she has been cheered up by the tº:
#. last night about a smash to a Brussels train. Well, than
eaven, you were not in that one. At first I thought you might
have been, but on reflection I found that Madrid, and Brussels were
not necessarily direct stations on each other's lines. Do, do take
Qare of yourself, and wrap up well if you go out at night. Nothing
is so deceptive, I am told, as a warm day in Spain. And above
all things, see that you have dry sheets in the hotels. Many a young
life has been cut off by damp sheets.”
THE fact of the matter is that the dear creatures revel in
anxieties and in carefully-planned alarms. If the nature of things
fails to provide them with a reasonable cause for apprehension, they
never fail to invent one for themselves. And yet, who would
change that “pleasing, anxious being,” a mother, for a being made
of sterner stuff? From our earliest days onward, in our schoolboy
troubles, in the difficulties that beset the undergraduate, in the cares
and ..º.º. that lie about the path of the man, it is to our
mothers that we turn by instinct in the sure confidence of being
comforted and encouraged. And who, in the time of our little
successes, will bear our banner with so bold a hand, and declare our
triumph with so clear a voice as a mother? Friends may fall away
from us, sorrow and pain may set their mark upon our faces, all the
world may speak ill of us, but the love of a mother shines unchanged
and unchangeable upon her wayward sons.
I READ the other day an account of the capture of a poacher by the
lice. In a struggle with the keepers he had given and taken some
ard knocks, and had º escaped. After an active search
of three days, the police tracked him down, and caught him in a
shed adjoining his mother's cottage. She was giving him a cup of
milk when the guardians of the law broke in upon them. “Let him
have the milk,” she said: “he’s had none too much to eat or
drink these last days.” What did it matter to her that he was a
poacher, and had knocked a keeper down. To her he was still a son
she still thought of him as the little fellow whose courage and bold
ways had been her pride and her fear years ago. I have no particu-
lar, sympathy, with those who batter keepers, but I hope this
particular }. was allowed to drink his milk before they marched
him away from his poor o'd mother's sight to the lock-up.
AND so let me end with Hood's beautiful lines:—
Gaze upon her living eyes, Pray for her at eve and morn
And mirror back her love for thee, H | That Heaven may long the strºke defer,
Hereafter thou may'st thudder sighs |For thou may'st live the hour forlorn
To meet thm when they cannot see. When thou wilt ask to die with her.
Gaze upon her living eyes! | Pray for her at eve and morn!
An Imperial Question.
|The German Emperor has stopped the fitting out at Cowes of the yacht
White Heather, which he had hired for a trip to the Mediterranean.]
O KAISER, what we are most eager to know
Is why you give up the White Heather?
It is not we are sure that you’d willingly show
On your nautical cap the white feather.
A Chance IN HIS ABSENCE.-Who does not remember the excellent
life-like portrait of “Dr. JIM,” painted by Professor HUBERT
HERKOMER, R.A., exhibited at Burlington House? . It was “a
IN MEMORIAM.
H.R.H. Prince Henry Maurice of Battenberg died at sea, of the effects of
African fiver, incurred in the Ashanti Campaign, on
January 20, 1896,
“UNTo each man his fate.” 'Twas his to fall
In a campaign else bloodless; yet may all
True victory's laurels deck this Prince's pall.
A brave man facing duty with stout heart
Knows not, nor heeds, whence flies the fatal dart;
To await it calmly is the hero's part.
In patriot battle's keen blood-stirring close
A man might chose to die, but history knows
Her noblest oft have fallen to unseen foes.
They serve who wait, England's great singer saith.
He who on duty's road encounters death,
With proud content may yield his latest breath.
All England grieves with her whom England's crown
Shields not from sorrow; nor its love, deep down
In myriad bosoms, from fate's adverse frown.
And her, the all-faithful daughter, loving wife,
The People's heart, perplext with sounds of strife,
And rumours wild wherewith the realm is rife,
Yet turns to her in this her hour of grief;
Praying for her Heaven's balm, of boons the chief,
The solace of home-love and high belief.
“COME HITHER, HUBERT!”
THAT artful necromancer, HUBERT HERKOMER, R.A., who holds us
enchanted by his skill, causing us to wonder at his daring; admire
his pluck, and his infinite capacity for § pains, is now thro
an. entirely new and, indeed, an electric light on the ancient Biac
(and White) art. He begins with a “positive process.”. Some persons
never in a lifetime get beyond this. These “positivists” employ a
process so positive, and believe in themselves, as royalists believe in
a monarch who can “do no wrong.” But this is not the case with our
gentle professor HUBERT: professor and eke a practiser. He goes from
the “positive” process to the “comparative,”—comparing other results
with those which he has already obtained;—and from the “compara-
tive” he arrives at the “superlative,” which he tells us in his lecture
is superlatively satisfactory, and is destined to supersede the more
laborious road, as the railway has superseded the coach: “In no
method of black and white work that is known to me,” says our
HUBERT, “is rapidity of workmanship so safe and so satisfactory.”
By this new º: the artist, who is to be his own reproducer, will,
in a jiffy (so to speak, and not quoting the words of the Master),
readily reach the masses with autographic touch, so that anyone with
a taste for real art, but lacking the means to gratify it, may acquire
a genuine article, whose originator “dessinit engravedit dédit.,et
sinédit,” for some ridiculously small sum within the capacity of the
shallowest pocket. “Oliver asks for more.” We would hear further
of this, anon,
A GAMPISH REMARK.--From the Weuve, Monnier et ses Fils
inquiry it appears, from the evidence, that the Weuve Monnier was
an invention of the ingenious person who sta the company.

We bluffed at poker—“Raise you three”—

With none at hand to say us Nay.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE NOWIGE AT NIAGARA.
AN exercise º -
The gentle art of skating,
When gracefully gyrating
You circle round the place,
To pretty partner prating
Of news not worth narrating,
It is most aggravating
To fall upon your face.
But then the joy of whirling,
Of twisting and of twirling,
Let Scotchmen sing of curling,
Of golf, and games like these,
I fly about like winking,
“So swanlike,” I am thinking,
When, on a sudden sinking,
'm down upon my knees.
As pale as alabaster,
The art I vow to master,
And, reckless of disaster,
Once more I will essay
To cut a simple “figger,”
Which hereisquitede."rigger,”

WoRDERFUL | Butten minutes
ago he was Gentleman Joe, the
red-faced, flaxen-haired Hansom
Cabby; and now he is the pasty-
faced, hook-nosed, black-bearded,
and black-haired Scengali. No
one can complain of not getting
full change for their money, so
complete is the transformation.
Gecko, Taffy, The Laird, Little
Billee, have their chances; while
Trilby herself, with the Baird
feet, is as near the original as
anyone totally different from her
can be when arrayed in a similar
costume. But all these are details
of no importance. The central
Tree-ilby figure is Svengali. The
travestie is introduced dº propos
de bottes, a phrase most applicable
in the case of “Trilby's tootsies,”
and depends simply and solely on
Mr. ARTHUR Rob ERTs's burlesque
impersonation of DU MAURIER's
memorable mesmeriser, Svengali.
There is not a Beerbohmian trick
that Mr. ARTHUR Roberts has
not caught and reproduced to pre-
posterously absurd perfection. It
is a very masterpiece of burlesque
imitation, the art of which is im-
pressid on, the audience by his
suddenly dropping it all, and
while retaining the make-up of
Svengali, he re-asserts his own
Arthurian individuality. Then,
the equally sudden resumption of
the Syengali manner is admirable.
Finally, within five minutes all
Spengali–a study in black and
white—has disappeared, and he
is once again the rubicund,
flaxen-haired Hansom Cabman.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
LAST week I was extolling the pocketable
library, by which I mean, especially, the
“small-pocket” library, as thereinmentioned.
If I omitted to particularise, as included in
my laudation, the red-backed, prettily bound,
and clearly typed series of standard works
in prose and poetry published by GEORGE
RouTLEDGE AND Sons, it is just because these
volumes, like the poor, are always with me;
and secondly, because, on their first appear-
ance in public, I had already given them
their meed of praise. The volumes I have
enumerated are genuinely “pocket volumes,”
i.e., volumes that can be, without any incon-
venience, carried in an ordinary-sized coat
pocket. The Cassell's Pocket º edited
by Max PEMBERTON, may suit CAssell's
º: (which, primarily, it was intended to
o), but will not suit mine, nor, as I expect,
any coat pocket, which already has to garry
a cigar-case and a note-book. The print is
exce lent, but in the case of The Paying
Guest, by GEORGE GISSING, the print is better
than the matter printed; for the story, begin-
ning well, and having a dramatis personae
artistically individualised, soon becomes un-
interestin 2 and then there's an end of it,
. No. 1 of “Pierrot's Library” (John LANE)
is a story called Pierrot, by H. DE WE RE
STAcPool E. A weird yet pathetic romance,
An idea such as inspired this story might
have occurred to the mystic fancy of a medi-
tating dreamer seated on a deserted terrace
amid the ruins of an old French château, as
he gazed, listlessly at first, then with a
curious interest, on two children, who, having
frightened, half-amused puzzlement, silently
regarding the broken statue of a faun. Then
they wander away into the woods, and so
vanish. Whereupon John-a-dreams con-
ceives the story of the place. There are but
few characters in it, but one of them,
Joniaur, an old Napoleonic corporal who lost
his arm at Waterloo, may remind some of
us, in a sketchy way, of a certain English
veteran named Corporal Trim. The French
used strange oaths in Flanders. So, probably,
did their men at Waterloo. It is a fasci-
nating romance for a spare couple %hours.

THE grey old grange is wrapped in light,
All dark the yew-tree glade,
Where in the loneliness of night
I make my ambuscade -
Hard by the tower, whence the chime
Proclaims the hour of rest,
And brings the beauty sleep of time
To you within your nest.
Beneath the terrace each parterre
Is silvered in the dew,
But not a blossom can compare
In loveliness with you.
The nightingale with trill and shake
Bids all my heart rejoice—
Her melody could never make
The music of your voice.
I stand on guard to meet the foe
Who causes you to weep,
As in the days of long ago
A knight his watch would keep.
My matchlock’s ready for the fray,
My aim is quick and true;
I’ll stop the bold marauder's way,
His cruelty he’ll rue!
The air is getting over-damp,
The screech-owl's cry is shrill;
I would that I might dare to stamp,
My feet are very chill.
What’s that? Bang! Bang! Revenge is

Two bunnies! both are dead!
They’ll never more your roses eat,
Nor keep me from my bed.

Quite so. What was thought expedient in 1665, is no less
necessary in 1896.
To be aure! And after all, it is acting with common sense.
The City Fleet will preserve the City commerce. Trade follows the
flag, so the protection of the flag is simply a matter of business. By
increasing the Navy, the City merely enlarges its powers of insurance.

DETERMINED on having day with hounds. Went to manège.
Hired animal that had once been a horse. It belonged, I should
say, to era of first NAPOLEoN, when it might have done duty as
charger during Peninsular War. Proprietor described it as “a
seasoned horse.” It struck me as “a many-seasoned horse.”
Climbed up. Seated, myself on, bick of this splendid ruin. Pro-
ceeded to the meet. Arrived. Felt
myself elevated and statuesque.
Find we are to hunt strong dead
herring instead of crafty, lively
fox. ave to wait some time, as
Whipper-in assures me that beau-
coup de monde are expected.
Beaucoup de monde don't come.
At length we move off. Hounds
are laid on (sounds like the gas or
the water, this, but sporting, never-
theless) in a small paddock, where
tº: ſº. accompanied
y a half-bred sheep-dog, is pre-
ared to receive cavalry. Noticing,
owever, that he is armed with a
two-pronged fork, we do not wait to exchange felicitations. Note.—
The Basques, although a happy and contented, are not a sporting race.
We speed across paddock, scrambling over formidable stone wall,
nearly eighteen inches high, into a lane. Up this we gallop at head-
long pace. Farther progress blocked by good paysans, who, in their
earnest desire to stop hunting, have dragged, from a cottage hard
by, a bedstead, two chairs, and a table: these, supplemented by
wire rope and donkey-cart, form barricade across lane. We swerve
aside and ride on recklessly; like Lützow's wild jäger, “a huntin
we go” (without music), across a country of ravine, common, an
cabbage-stalks, until my own career is ruthlessly cut short through
the heirloom I am bestriding falling over a fence into a melon-frame.
M. le propriétaire emerges from cottage. He says things. Seems
quite excited, and doesn't appear to care for le sport. He works
himself up into such a state of loquacity that he executes a sort of
savage dance, during which he heedlessly approaches the south-
western corner of my cheval de chasse. *i." gives casual glance
round, and Inote an expression in his starboard eye which bodes ill to
somebody. I essay to warn M. le propriétaire in my very best French.
He ignores my best French, and º: the worst possible French,
directed towards me. In his wrath he inadvertently draws quite
near the dangerous corner of prehistoric steed. For once the expected
happens. Expected by me, unexpected by him. The Expected Un-
expected takes, the form of a double-barrelled-extra-high-pressure
drive from both heels of prehistoric quadruped accurately directed
at the nearest available spot on the body of M. le propriétaire. A
crash! Not of bones, but glass. Mister the proprietor has gone
backwards into one of his own melon-frames. Here he sits in the
shape of a “V,” his head out one side and his legs upwards on the
other, as helpless as a Punch-doll doubled up in his box, . Finding
myself, fortunately, still in the saddle, I urge the prehistoric to
greater efforts; in a few minutes, at all events long before Mister
the Proprietor has extricated himself from his “glass with care,” we
are on the high road. . . . Safely returned to stable. Say, patro-
nisingly, “Pas mal ce cheval” (which has a touch, of poetry in it);
and am discreetly silent as to the incident of Mister the proprietor and
the melon-frame. The next day I quit the locality, omitting to

JOTTINGS AND TITTLINGS.
(By BAB00 HURRY BUNGsHo JABBERJEE, B,A.)
No. IV.
Containing Mr. Jabberjee's Impressions at The Old Masters.
I HAVE the honour to report that the phantom of delight has
recently recommenced to dance before, me, , Miss, JESSIMINA
MANKLETow, the perfumed, moony-faced daughter of the gracious
and eagle-eyed goddess who presides over the select boarding es-
tablishment in which I am resident member, has of late emerged
from the shell of superciliousness, and brought the beaming eye of
encouragement to bear upon my diffidence and humility. This I
partly attribute to general impression—which I do not condescend to
deny—that, at home, I occupy the social status of a Rajah, or some
analogous kind of big native pot.
So, on a recent Saturday afternoon, she invited me to escorther and
a similar young virginal lady friend,
by name Miss PRISCILLA PRIMMETT, to
Burlington House, Piccadilly, and, as
Prince Hamlet appositely remarks,
“Look here upon this picture and on
this.” . Which I joyfully accepted,
being head-over-heels in love with
Art, and the possessor of two mag-
nificent coloured photo-lithographs,
representing a steeplechase in the act
of jumping a trench, and a water-
nymph in the very décolleté undress of
“puris naturalibus,” weltering on a
rushy bed.
..We proceeded thither upon the
giddy summit of a Royal Oak omni-
bus, and on arriving in the vestibulum,
Were Fº commanded to
undergo total abstinence from our
umbrellas.

silken affair with the golden head,

was so lucky to obtain promiscuously
after witnessing the Adelphi ºf the
Westminster college boys, I naturally
protested vehemently against such
arbitrary, and tyrannical regulations,
urging the risk of my unprotected
umbrella being feloniously abducted
during unavoidable absence by some
* led and illegitimate claimant.
ut. alack! I was confronted with
the official ultimatum and sine quá
non, and have subsequently learnt
that the cause of this self-denying
ordinance is due to the uncontrollable
enthusiasm of British Public for works
of art, which leads, them to signify
approbation by puncturing innumera-
ble orifices dint of sticks or
umbrellas, in the process of pointing
out tit-bits of painting, and on ac-
count of the detrimental influence on
the marketable value of pictures thus
distinguished by the plerophory of the Voz Populi.
Nevertheless, my heart was oppressed with many misgivings at
having to hand over three hostage umbrellas–one being masculine
and two feminine gender-and receiving nothing in exchange but a
wooden medallion of no intrinsic worth, bearing the utterly dispro-
portionate, number of over one thousand! Next, after, at Miss
JessiºnA's bidding, having purchased a sixpenny index, we
ascended the staircase, and on shelling out three shillings cash
payments, were consecutively squeezed through a restricted wicket
as if needles oing through the eye of a camel,
I will vouchsafe to aver that my interior sensations on penetrating
the first gallery were those of acute and indignant disappointment,
for will it be credited that a working majority of the exhibits were
second, or even third and fourth-han º: of an unparagoned
dingitude, and fit only for the lumbering room?
Perhaps I shall be told that this wintry exhibition is a mere stopgap
and makeshift, until a fresh supply of bright new paintings can be
procured, and that it is ultra vires to obtain such for love or money
before the merry month of May. Still I must persist in denouncing
the penny wisdom and pound foolery of the Academicals infoisting off
upºn the public such ancient and fish-like articles that have long ceased
“Miss Jessimina Mankletow.”
..It is to be hoped that these parsimonious Misters will soon recog:
nise that it is not possible for modern up-to-date Art to be florescent
under this retrograde and fossilized system, and be warned that such
untradesmanlike goings-on will deservedly forfeit the confidence and
patronage of their most fastidious customers.
Miss JESSIMINA remarked more than once that such and such a
picture was not in her taste and she would never have chosen it
pººl while Miss PRIMMETT declared that she would not have
ad her likeness taken by Hon'ble. Sir Josh GAINSBoRo, or Misters
WELASKY and WANDICK, not even if they implored her on their
bended marrowbones, and that, as for a certain individual effemi-
nately named ETTY, it was a wonderment to her how respectable
people could stand in front of such brazen performances! These
remarks are trivial, perhaps, but even straws will serve as cocks of
the weather on occasions, and, moreover, I shall certify that the most
general tone was of a critical and disapproving severity, and it was
3. evident that the greater portion of the spectators could have
one the job better themselves.
A certain Mister TURNER came in
for the BENJAMIN's mess of obloquy,
having represented Pluto, the god of
wealth, in the act of carrying off a
female Proserpine, but the figures so
Lilliputian, and in such a dispropor-
tionateexpansion of confused sceneries,
that the Telopement produced but a
very paltry impression. . The slipshod
carelessness of this painter may be
realised from the fact that in a com-
position styled “Blue Lights to Warn
Steamboats off Shoal Water,” the blue
lights are conspicuous by their total
absence, and the mistiness of the at-
mospherical conditions renders it diffi-
cult to distinguish either the steamers
or the shoals with even tolerable
accuracy!
In the ulterior room were sundry
productions from Umbrian and Mi-
lanese and other schools, such being
presumptively the teaching establish-
ments over which Hon'ble REYNoLDS
* and TURNER and GREUzy and Co. pre-
dominated as Old Masters. But surely
it is unfair, and like seething a kid in
the maternal nutriment, to class such
crude and hobbardyhoy performances
with works by more senile hands !
Here I observed a painting to illus-
trate scenes in the life of an importanti
celebrity, who was childishly repre-
sented many times over having sepa-
rate adventures in the space. of a few:
square feet, and of a Brobdingnacian
bulkiness compared to his perspective
surroundings. Had this been the work
of an Indian artist, native gentlemen:
out there would simply have smiled
É. at such ignorance, and given
im the gentle admonishment that he
was only to make a fool of himself for
his pains. There was also a picture of
a, Diptych, in two portions, with a
background of gilt, but the figure of the Diptych himself very
poorly represented as an anatomy. - - - - - -- -
ere all is so so-so, and below par, it is perhaps invidious to
single out any for hon’ble mention; but loyalty as a British subject
obliges me to speak favourably of a concern lent by Her Majesty the
QUEEN, and representing a bombastical youth engaged in §:
snap with a meek and inoffensive schoolfellow, who supports himself
on one leg, and is occupied in sheltering his nose behind his arm
until his widowed and aged mother can arrive to rescue her beloved
* from his grave crisis. -
This at least can be commended as being true to nature, as I can
attest from personal experience of similar boyish loggerheads,
although, owing to preserving my sang froid, I was generally able to
remove myself with phenomenal rapidity from vicinity of shocking
kicks by my truculent assailant.
Also a subject, by late Hon’ble REYNoLDs, of a student who, as
Miss JEssIMINA informed me, vivá voce, from the guide-book, was
“supposed to be a portrait of ¥ſaster Brown.” I will not allege that
it is as like as two peas to the Mister BRowN of Westbourne Grove,
of whom I have lately commanded a pair of patent leathers, but, non
constat that it may not be a correct, representation of him in his

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI,
Let me not omit to mention a painting of “Polichinelle” by a
Gallic artist, which Miss PRIMMETT said was the French equivalent
to Punch. At which, speaking loudly for instruction of bystanders,
I assured them, as one familiarly connected with Hon’ble Punch,
who regarded me as a son, such a portrait was the very antipode to
his majestic lineaments, nor was it reasonable to suppose that he
would allow his counterfeit presentment to be depicted in the un-
dignified garbage of a buffoon!
trust, that I may be gratefully remembered by my Liege Lord,
and that he will be ſº enough to entertain me favourably with
something in the shape of prize or bonus in reward for such open
testimony as the above.
I have only to add that the custodian preserved the inviolability ºf
our umbrellas with honorable fidelity, and that we, moistened the
drooping clay of our internal tenements at an Aérated Tea Compan
with a profusion of confectionaries, for which my fair friends wit
amiable blandness permitted me the privilege of forking out.
THE WARES OF TAUTOLOGUS.
"BREAKFAST At A CoFFEE-STALL,”
SAITH Sir John Falstaff-robustious, corpulent eques—to Prince
Hal, “O, thou hast damnable iteration!” and the Post Meridiem
Gazette's numberless perusers turning to the wares of their faithful,
humble TAUTologus, doubtless exclaim, “O, thou hast delectable
iteration!” For hath he not
described countless times in
constantly varying style How
the crocus in early spring
hursteth through terra firma,
How doves circle about St.
Paul's dome and strut in the
cathedral yard, How the cross-
ing-sweeper sweepeth, How
the wealthy dine, lunch, sup—
et hoc genus omnef And shall
he not make friends acquainted
with his methods of preparing
these feasts literarum–Sarda-
napalian word banquets?
Verily yea. Know then that
TAUTologus hath little sack
full of assorted epithets, quo-
tations—not too eyed—
from classics, slightest sprink-
ling, or minimum quantity, of
definite article, plentiful supply
of dashes, brackets, commas
(inverted), notes of interroga-
tion and eke exclamation.
jº these main ingre-
dients he produceth essay not,
i. unworthy his Elian
predecessor.
. Nor, is TAUTOLogus altogether unassisted in his labours at the
sign of “The Wares.” Mrs. T. discourseth not seldom, with delicate
fascinating touch of lettered feminine hand, upon world-aborting
topics such as “Chickens and Hens,” “Geese and Foxes,” “Ducks,
“Socks,” “Silk,” and “ §º. 'Tis no idle flattery to pro-
nounce her effusions not second to those of your obedient, obsequious
servant himself. Revert we now to title of present article, “Break-
fast at a Coffee-Stall.” 0, thou Shrove-tide reveller 1 homewards
wending upon Shanksian steed—the city, justere rosy-fingered dawn
(p45083rtvNos Ews) makes first appearance, being *...* not
the unassuming vendor of irreproachable Mocha, comfortably en-
sconced in ben trovato indentation of a house's wall, or in cleverly-
chosen cul-de-sac. Stay rather to dissipate fumes of thy nocturnal
debauch in steaming cup (poculum) filled from huge throbbing urn
situated at the dexter extremity of immaculate linoleum-covered
counter. Drink the comforting beverage as "piping-hot” (pot
bouille) as throat will bear. Then, if impaired digestion permit and
TAutologus's advice be followed, let the palate be tempted by
dainty, insidious sardine, deftly served upon crisp, º: of
toast. Neither, upon this exquisite plat, neglect to sprinkle purple,
liquant powder-the product of distant º:
ow is apparent the full force of TALLEYRAND's truism—or
B8ILLAT, SAVARIN's was it?—“L'appétit rient en mangeant.”
Order, therefore, pomme Irlandaise-the apple of Hibernia, the
potato-roasted, and not divested of its jacket. Cut in halves and
lubricate its mealy interior with judicious quantity of margarine,
which, the amiable caterer provideth upon application., Shun, with
this dish, sardine-suitable Cayenne, flavouring instead with black
pepper and a soupçon of salt only. Hunger's pangs appeased, a
second copious draught of the coffee-berry's decoction may not be
the street to diurnal duties, and thou-top-hatted, brazenly-belated
scion of Society-art an incongruous object on the awakening town-
scape. Retire then, rapidly, to thy domicilium, not forgetting to
purchase from the all provi ing matutinal restaurateur-fumi sacra
finesſ-a fragrant Denarian weed of genuine home-grown Havana.
Bid him a courteous “Vale,” and proceed, refreshed, upon * way
—now no longer tortuous nor encumbered by multiplicity of lamp-
posts. Thou hast broken thy fast like a king—at a coffee-stall!
ALFRED TO ALFRED,
(A very Up-to-date Song from the Shades.)
O ALFRED, ALFRED, ALFRED ! Since you also bear my name,
You might have more respected both my feelings and my fame;
For copy-book moralities, piped forth as by a starling, -
Will not make England venerate the memory of her “Darling.”
I do not love that name, ALFRED ; it does not match with mine;
It savours of suburban “spoons,” or rustic “Walentine.”
l’m told by those who know, ALFRED, when bourgeois sweethearts
meet,
They doat, like you, on “darling,” dwell, like you, on “Sweet !
Sweet! Sweet !” [Park.
Which may do for amorous Hampstead, or for Cockney Clapham
Or for ANGELINA “walking-out” with Edwin, her new spark;
But for Edwy and EDGIWA, quite another sort of pair [the air,”
(Though the latter's name “soared into space, and summered all
As you credibly inform us,)—well, I don't wish to be harsh,
But two Anglo-Saxon lovers, in a damp, “low-lying marsh,”
Hardly talked such twiddle-twaddle, when we had to fight the Dane,
As a couple of canoodlers in a Cockney Lovers' Lane.
There’s a want of “local colour,” my dear ALFRED, in your lay,
For we did not war, or wanton, in your mild suburban way.
There is too much sugar-candy in your handling of such themes,
And your Muse-if I may say so—is too fond of chocolate-creams.
You know I touched the harp myself, but, on your Laureate-lyre,
Youtwiddle in a fashion which had oused grim GUTHRUM's ire.
And Celt and Briton, Anglº Frisian, Saxon, Norseman too,
Would have seized their “shrilling weapors,” and at once have
gone for you!
I was quite a moral model, as king's go, I am aware;
But I don't remember having such a go-to-m esting air
As your virtuous “England's Yum-yum ”—I mean “Darling ”–
seems to sport.
And as to “forehead questioning the sky”-0, cut it shortl
I’d a “virile love of country,” or at least I hope I had,
But thrasonic gush about it would have made me feel quite mad.
In dear old “foam-fenced England” I should feel myself at home,
But not among the Jingoes who are also given to “foam,”—
Foam at the month, my ALFRED, like mad dogs and men in fits.
There be “patriots” and “poets,” my dear ALFRED, wits and cits,
Who the muzzle and strait-jacket seem, at seasons, to require.
“ALFRED shall have this England”—as a theme for his new lyre;
It seems rather hard cn England, so the earlier ALFRED thinks,
An idea from which my “practical imagination” shrinks.
Still, I wouldn't mind so much if ALFRED limited his odes
To paeans upon JAMESON, and dithyrambs on RHoDEs.
But it sets the shades a-sniggering and old Cerberusa-snarling
To think of Saxon ALFRED being shrined in—England's Darling!!!

SIR,--I am sure you will be glad to hear how unusually mild the
season is with us in the country. As a proof of the fact, the follow:
ing may be of interest. The other day Mr. SIDESPLITTER, a local
gentleman, was accused by a lady friend of having cut her in the
street. He replied—“It was such a little cut, that it might almost
be called a cu'let /* Can you imagine anything milder than that ?
A RESIDENT AT SPARKLINGTON.
SIR,-Our venerated old clergyman met my boy TEDDY (aged six)
yesterday, and asked him when he was going to school, and if he was
going, to be a boarder. Tºppy promptly retorted that “he didn't
intend to go to a board school.” This is another instance of how
extremely forward we are in the country this season 1
PROUD PATER,

JOTTINGS AND TITTLINGS.
(By BABoo HURRY BUNGsHo JABBERJEE, B.A.)
No. IV.
Containing Mr. Jabberjee's Impressions at The Old Masters.
I HAVE the honour to report that the phantom of delight has
recently recommenced to dance before me: , Miss., JEssIMINA
MANKLETow, the perfumed, moony-faced daughter of the gracious
and eagle-eyed goddess who presides over the select boarding es-
tablishment in which I am resident member, has of late emerged
from the shell of superciliousness, and brought the beaming, eye of
encouragement to bear upon my diffidence and humility. This I
partly attribute to general impression—which I do not condescend to
deny—that, at home, I occupy the social status of a Rajah, or some
analogous kind of big native pot.
So, on a recent Saturday afternoon, she invited me to escorther and
a similar young virginal lady friend,
by name Miss PBISCILLA PRIMMETT, to
Burlington House, Piccadilly, and, as
Prince Hamlet appositely remarks,
“Look here upon this picture and on
this.” . Which I joyfully accepted,
being head-over-heels in love with
Art, and the possessor of two mag-
nificent coloured photo-lithographs,
representing a steeplechase in the act
of jumping a trench, and a water-
nymph in the very décolleté undress of
“puris naturalibus,” weltering on a
rushy bed.
..We proceeded thither upon the
giddy summit of a Royal Oak omni-
bus, and on arriving in the vestibulum,
Were Fº commanded to
undergo total abstinence from our

umbrella being feloniously abducted
during unavoidable absence by some
unprincipled and illegitimate claimant.

that the cause of this self-denying
ordinance is due to the uncontrollable

of art, which leads, them to signify

But I don't remember having such a go-to-m esting air
As your virtuous “England's Yum-yum ”—I mean “Darling ”—
seems to sport.
And as to “forehead questioning the sky”-0, cut it shortl
I’d a “virile love of country,” or at least I hope I had,
But thrasonic gush about it would have made me feel quite mad.
In dear old “foam-fenced England” I should feel myself at home,
But not among the Jingoes who are also given to “foam,”—
Foam at the month, my ALFRED, like mad dogs and men in fits.
There be “patriots” and “poets,” my dear ALFRED, wits and cits,
Who the muzzle and strait-jacket seem, at seasons, to require.
“ALFRED shall have this England”—as a theme for his new lyre;
It seems rather hard cn England, so the earlier ALFRED thinks,
An idea from which my “practical imagination” shrinks.
Still, I wouldn't mind so much if ALFRED limited his odes
To paeans upon JAMESON, and dithyrambs on RHoDEs.
But it sets the shades º: and old Cerberus a-snarling
To think of Saxon ALFRED being shrined in-England's Darling.'''
RURALITIES.
SIR,--I am sure you will be glad to hear how unusually mild the
season is with us in the country. As a proof of the fact, the follow:
ing may be of interest. The other day Mr. SIDESPLITTER, a local
gentleman, was accused by a lady friend of haying cut her in the
street. He replied—“It was such a little cut, that it might almost
be called a cu'let /* Can you imagine anything milder than that ?
A IDENTAT SPARKLINGTON.
SIR,-Our venerated old clergyman met my boy TEDDY (aged six)
yesterday, and asked him when he was going to school, and if he was
going, to be a boarder. Tºppy promptly retorted that “he didn't
intend to go to a board school.” This is another instance of how
extremely forward we are in the country this season 1
PROUD PATER,
SIR,-The precocity of the vegetation for the time of year is truly
remarkable. A lad of mine has just come in from the º: and
tells me he found a rose out! I have not seen it myself, but the boy
is incapable of an untruth, and I think the unparalleled event (for
January) deserves a notice in your columns.
DARWIN CUVIER JONES',
P.S.—I find it was the watering-pot rose that the lad found. Still
the fact remains that the watering-pot itself was out at a period of

amiss. Day now dawneth, the horny-handed one hurrieth along
the year earlier than I ever remember.

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
ADMIRAL THUNDER.
Not long ago I received a letter from my old friend Admiral
THUNDER: That is not his real name, but it is the name by which
he was universally known, throughout the service while he was still
on the active list, and it still clings to him in his retirement. Origi-
nally due to the old sea dog's inveterate habit of expressing himself
in the strongest language whenever his anger or his interest was
aroused, it has lost none of its applicability now that the Admiral no
longer directs the movements of a squadron, or keeps his clear blue
eye on the signs of the weather in mid ocean. Indeed, advancing
ears, far from mitigating the matchless ferocity of the Admiral's
anguage, have, if anything, rather increased its force and copious-
ness. The causes that provoke the dear old sailor's outbursts are
necessarily more trivial in the pleasant little Hampshire house where
he is spending what he has, for six years at least, called the last few
days of his life, than they were on board a battleship; but this
makes no difference to the Admiral.. I do not mean to say that the
Admiral is a habitual or even a frequent swearer of oaths. Here
and there one of these short, crisp little words, will pop out, but set
as it is in one of the Admiral's flaming sentences, its appearance is
: noticed as would be the crack of a toy pistol in the midst of
a tornado,
I spoke just now of the Admiral's advancing years. I must not
be misunderstood. He is still well on the fair-weather side of
seventy; his eye is undimmed, his step is elastic, his figure is erect,
his noble chest is not yet shrunk from the broad expanse on which,
in former days, a brilliant array of medals used to glitter, and his
voice, though it merely shakes the rafters of his country home, or
echoes through the woods, is not less resonant than when it used to
strike obedience into his crew. His thick and stubborn hair is grey,
but in his crisp beard the dark is still the ruling colour. He has
seen much war-service from the day when, as one of PEEL's lion-
hearts, he first heard a shot fired in anger in the Crimea, and won
the admiration of all his comrades, not merely by his constant and
cheerful performance of his º duties, but by the almost
*...* act of heroism by which he saved the life of a fellow-
ilor, and earned for himself three severe wounds and the Victoria
the severest stress of weather, his masterly disposition of a squadron,
were always of the kind that are exercised only by the few sailors
who combine with a love of their profession and a mastery of all its
details, undaunted courage, prompt resolution, and an instinctive
grip of every situation in which they find themselves.
THE Admiral has never been married. He passed safely, if not
entirely unscathed, from a youth which, if rumour may be trusted,
had its gay and dashing complications, through a not unsusceptible
middle age, and so into the bachelor bliss of his veteranship. He
did, I believe, make one proposal of marriage, but his language in
the excitement of this unusual moment was so violent that the lady,
naturally of a timid disposition, having summoned up all the courage
she could command, shuddered out a harsh “No,” and fled interrorfrom
the room. The Admiral looked upon the incident as a warning, and
never repeated the experiment. . But he bore no malice, and in time
grew to treat the matter as one for jocular allusion, speaking of it as
“perhaps the one cocasion. Sir, in a long and stormy career, when a
woman, yes, a woman, by the immortal Jingo, showed herself wiser,
ten thousand everlasting million times wiser, than this old hulk
here; may his one-horse-power engines burst into blue blazes if ever
he gives another woman a chance.” The decision was a wise one:
the Admiral was not made for matrimony, and no doubt he was
happier living, as he did, at Rodney Lodge, not far from the New
Forest, under the care of his two admiring maiden sisters, than he
would have been with a wife to check his outgoings and keep watch
over his incomings.
SUCH, then, was and is Admiral THUNDER. His two sisters, “the
girls,” as he calls them, mere chits of sixty and sixty-two, keep
house for him, admire him, recite his exploits, disregard his furious
explosions, and coddle and cosset him to his heart's content whenever
he is seized with one of those colás which, according to the Admiral,
are the sure, heralds of that galloping consumption, which is
eventually to bring him to his grave. For the Admiral is, if the
truth must be told, inclined, like many vigorous, and healthy men,
to magnify the extent, and the danger of his little ailments. From
a passing twinge in his chest he has been known to infer, a long-
standing fatty degeneration of the heart; a red patch, on his neck
convinces him that blood poisoning, in an aggravated form, has set

Cross. And his sea knowledge, his power of handling his ship under

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
causes might be assigned, made it an article of faith with him for a
whole week that his doom would, come through creeping paralysis,
All these dreadful threatenings, it must be, said, do not much affect
the Admiral's cheerful spirits. He is much more likely, in fact, to
be rendered morose if anyone should, dare to hint a doubt as to the
necessarily fatal issue of his complaint. Yet the Admiral never calls
in a doctor; he is attended to by the girls and by his faithful old
body servant, a former A.B., who now makes himself useful about
the house in a hundred little ways as only a sailor can. These three
between them, have brought the Admiral through every mortal
illness known to medical science.
Knowing my old friend's peculiarities I was not much alarmed,
therefore, when I received from him a letter in which he informed
me that what he had long expected had now come about, that
phthisis in its most acute form had attacked him, that he had a
racking, hacking cough calculated by its own unaided efforts to sweep
away a whole ship's company, that death, which he did not in the
least fear, had come within easy signalling distance, and that if I
wanted to see him again alive I was to come as soon as possible. I
concluded, as was indeed the case, that the Admiral had a bad cold,
and that, 'being confined to the house, he would be glad of a slight
change of ‘....". S2. I packed my bag and shortly found
myself at ey Lodge. The girls received me in the morning
room. “We are glad §: have come,” said Miss ELSPETH, the elder,
“for the Admiral has been so looking for you. We do not anticipate
his immediate demise, but there is great danger, very great danger.”
“Shall I go to him at once?”. I asked.. “Perhaps that would be
best,” said Miss AGNEs. “He is in his study; it is a warmer room
than his bedroom, and being on the ground-floor we can more
quickly and easily attend to his wants, But, I fear, you will find
him sadly changed.” As I approached the study I became conscious
that, in voice at any rate, and in fury, the Admiral was still his old
self. It was booming through the door and along the passage like a
broadside from a three-decker. “May heaven forgive me,” he was
roaring, “if that is not the most astounding, immoral, and incom-
parable act of double-distilled folly that ever you, abandoned worm
as you are, have ever committed in the course of {. misspent
life. Why, you hoary, old Japanese mask, you, I told you not more
than an hour ago—an hour? it wasn't haif-an-hour by all the
immortal powers—” At this point I entered the room. The
Admiral, who was sitting in his armchair, a rug wrapped round his
knees, a thick woollen comforter round his throat, and a cloth cap on
his head, never paused for a moment in the torrent that he was
pouring on the imperturbable head of his servant. . . Here,” he
continued, “is a friend who will bear witness to what I say. This
man, Sir, has the effrontery, I can call it nothing else, by gad; he
has the unparalleled effrontery to bring me my white wine whey
now, when he knows that I cannot by any possible concatenation of
circumstances, want it for another hour. hy, curse you, you’re
grinning.” (AMos had, it must be admitted, winked at me.) “I’ll
break every—” But what the Admiral would have threatened
must remain a subject for conjecture, for at this Fº a violent fit of
sneezing came upon him, and when he recovered from it his anger
had vanished like a summer cloud, and he not only greeted me
warmly, but accepted a dry handkerchief from the hands of the
attentive AMos and took his white wine whey without another
thought as to its premature appearance. He then assured me that
his will was made, all his affairs were in order, death might be
expected at any moment, and he hoped I should be able to stay for
at least a week. Personally he would have preferred a month, but
he couldn't expect that from me.
In two days he was as right as a trivet. On the third day he came
up to town, with me, gave me a first-rate dinner at his club, and
visited Trilby afterwards. “By the Lord Harry, Sir,” he said, as
we came out, “I could hardly contain myself from springing on to
the stage and throttling, that greasy, dirty, swab-faced villain
Svengali. The man tainted the air, Sir, he poisoned it by his foul
resence. May I be fed for ever on bilge-water if he oughtn't to
ave a thousand dozen.” Here he stopped suddenly in his walk.
“What's up, Admiral?” I asked, “A pain, Sir, a red-hot demon

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
ADMIRAL THUNDER.
Not long, ago I received a letter from my old friend, Admiral
THUNDER: That is not his real name, but it is the name by which
he was universally known throughout the service while he was still
on the active list, and it still clings to him in his retirement. Origi-
nally due to the old sea dog's inveterate habit of expressing himself
in the strongest language whenever his anger or his interest was
aroused; it has lost none of its applicability now that the Admiral no
longer directs the movements of a squadron, or keeps his clear blue
eye on the signs of the weather in mid ocean. Indeed, advancing
ears, far from mitigating the matchless ferocity of the Admiral's
anguage, have, if anything, rather increased its force and copious-
ness. The causes that provoke the dear old sailor's outbursts are
necessarily more trivial in the pleasant little Hampshire house where
he is spending what he has, for six years at least, called the last few
days of his life, than they were on board a battleship; but this
makes no difference to the Admiral. I do not mean to say that the
Admiral is a habitual or even a frequent swearer of oaths. Here
and there one of these short, crisp little words, will pop out, but set
as it is in one of the Admiral's flaming sentences, its appearance is
: noticed as would be the crack of a toy pistol in the midst of
a tornado,
I spoke just now of the Admiral's advancing years. I must not
be misunderstood. He is still well on the fair-weather side of
seventy; his eye is undimmed, his step is elastic, his figure is erect,
his noble chest is not yet shrunk from the broad expanse on which,
informer days, a brilliant array of medals used to glitter, and his
voice, though it merely shakes the rafters of his country home, or
echoes through the woods, is not less resonant than when it used to
strike obedience into his crew. His thick and stubborn hair is grey,
but in his crisp beard the dark is still the ruling colour. He has
seen much war-service from the day when, as one of PEEL's lion-
hearts, he first heard a shot fired in anger in the Crimea, and won
the admiration of all his comrades, not merely by his constant and
cheerful performance of his ºff." duties, but by the almost
*...* act of heroism by which he saved the life of a fellow-
ilor, and earned for himself three severe wounds and the Victoria
the severest stress of weather, his masterly disposition of a squadron,
were always of the kind that are exercised only by the few sailors
who combine with a love of their profession and a mastery of all its
details, undaunted courage, prompt resolution, and an instinctive
grip of every situation in which they find themselves.
THE Admiral has never been married. He passed safely, if not
entirely unscathed, from a youth which, if rumour may be trusted,
had its gay and dashing complications, through a not unsusceptible
middle age, and fo into the bachelor bliss of his veteranship. He
did, I believe, make one proposal of marriage, but his language in
the excitement of this unusual moment was so violent that the lady,
naturally of a timid disposition, having summoned up all the courage
she could command, shudderedoutaharsh “No,” and fled interrorfrom
the room. The Admiral looked upon the incident as a warning, and
never repeated the experiment. . But he bore no malice, and in time
grew to treat the matter as one for jocular allusion, speaking of it as
“perhaps the one cocasion, Sir, in a long and stormy career, when a
woman, yes, a woman, by the immortal Jingo, showed herself wiser,
ten thousand everlasting million times wiser, than this old hulk
here; may his one-horse-power engines burst into blue blazes if ever
he gives another woman a chance.” The decision was a wise one:
the Admiral was not made for matrimony, and no doubt he was
happier living, as he did, at Rodney Lodge, not far from the New
Forest, under the care of his two admiring maiden sisters, than he
would have been with a wife to check his outgoings and keep watch
over his incomings.
Such, then, was and is Admiral THUNDER. His two sisters, “the
girls,” as he calls them, mere chits of sixty and sixty-two, keep
house for him, admire him, recite his exploits, disregard his furious
explosions, and coddle and cosset him to his heart's content whenever
he is seized with one of those colás which, according to the Admiral,
are the sure heralds of that galloping consumption, which is
eventually to bring him to his grave. For the Admiral is, if the
truth must be told, inclined, like many vigorous, and healthy men,
to magnify the extent, and the danger of his little ailments. From
a passing twinge in his chest he has been known to infer, a long-
standing fatty degeneration of the heart; a red patch, on his neck
convinces him that blood poisoning, in an aggravated form, has set

Cross. And his sea knowledge, his power of handling his ship under

causes might be assigned, made it an article of faith with him for a
whole week that his doom would, come through creeping ysis.
All these dreadful threatenings, it must be said, do not much affect
the Admiral's cheerful spirits. He is much more likely, in fact, to
be remiered morone if anyone should dare to hint a doubt as to the
necessarily fatal issue of his complaint. Yet the Admiral never calls
in a doctor; he is attended to by the girls, and by his faithful old
body servant, a former A.B., who now makes himself useful about
the house in a hundred little ways as only a sailor can. These three
between them, have brought the Admiral through every mortal
illness known to medical science.
Knowing my old friend's peculiarities I was not much alarmed,
therefore, when I received from him a letter in which he informed
me that what he had long expected had now come about, that
phthisis in its most acute form had attacked him, that he had a
racking, hacking cough calculated by its own unaided efforts to sweep
away a whole ship's company, that death, which he did not in the
least fear, had come within easy signalling distance, and that if I
wanted to see him again alive I was to come as soon as possible. I
concluded, as was indeed the case, that the Admiral had a bad cold,
and that, being confined to the house, he would be glad of a slight
change of companionship. So I packed my bag and shortly found
myself at #. Lodge. The girls received me in the morning
room... “We are glad you have come,” said Miss ELSPETH, the elder,
“for the Admiral has $. so looking for you. We do not anticipate
his immediate demise, but there is great danger, very great danger.”
“Shall I go to him at once?”. I asked.. “Perhaps that would be
best,” said Miss AGNEs. “He is in his study; it is a warmer room
than his bedroom, and being on the ground-floor we can, more
quickly and easily attend to his wants, But, I fear, you will find
him sadly changed.” As I approached the study I became conscious
that, in voice at any rate, and in fury, the Admiral was still his old
. It was booming through the door and along the passage like a
broadside from a three-decker. “May heaven forgive me,” he was
roaring, “if that is not the most astounding, immoral, and incom-
parable act of double-distilled folly that ever you, abandoned worm
as you are, have ever committed in the course of your misspent
life. Why, you hoary, old Japanese mask, you, I told you not more
than an hour ago—an hour? it wasn't haifan-hour by all the
immortal powers—” At this point I entered the room. The
Admiral, who was sitting in his armchair, a rug wrapped round his
knees, a thick woollen comforter round his throat, and a cloth cap on
his head, never paused for a moment in the torrent that he was
pouring on, the imperturbable head of his servant. , 'Here,” he
continued, “is a friend who will bear witness to what I say. This
man, Sir, has the effrontery, I can call it nothing else, by gad, he
has the ..º. effrontery to bring me my white wine whey
now, when he knows that I cannot by any possible concatenation of
circumstances want it for another hour. hy, curse you, you’re
grinning.” (AMos had, it must be admitted, winked at me.) “I’ll
break every—” But what the Admiral would have threatened
must remain a subject for conjecture, for at this point a violent fit of
sneezing came upon him, and when he recovered from it his anger
had vanished like a summer cloud, and he not only greeted me
warmly, but accepted a dry handkerchief from the hands of the
attentive AMos and took his white wine whey without another
thought as to its premature appearance. He then assured me that
his will was made, all his affairs were in order, death might be
expected at any moment, and he hoped I should be able to stay for
at least a week. Personally he would have preferred a month, but
he couldn't expect that from me.
In two days he was as right as a trivet. On the third day he came
up to town, with me, gave me a first-rate dinner at his club, and
visited Trilby afterwards. “By the Lord Harry, Sir,” he said, as
we came out, “I could hardly contain myself from springing on to
the stage and throttling, that greasy, dirty, swab-faced villain
Svengali. The man tainted the air, Sir, he poisoned it by his foul
resence. May I be fed for ever on bilge-water if he oughtn't to
ave a thousand dozen,” Here he stopped suddenly in his walk.
“What's up, Admiral?” I asked, “A pain, Sir, a red-hot demon
of pain in my leg. I know what it is. I have got hip-disease.”

and join her in a “Tom Cat”

and a cigarette. Her courtesy
gave me time to look round
this dainty little den of refined
dissipation. The furniture was

the pictures were mainly por-

and roses, and sundry little morocco cases, which, were I in ever-
beautiful Paris, I should suggest contained les bijoux de la reine.
I observed, too, that the old cheval mirror was severely cracked in
several places (could it have been by reason of Goosſe's lightning
lances? Quien sabe? as they say in Cuba), and that my hostess's
avourite face-powder was Folle-Farine, the Helicate violet requisite
just evolved from the laboratory of TARTINE & Co. of Bond Street.
Goosie, happily for fearsome Me, opened the ball, “How,” she
asked, with her winsome Whitechapel accent, which I will not

earnestly disclaimed any attempt to indulge in a sport which I had
heard of as tant soit pew chic. Goosſ; smiled languidly, the sort of
risible separation of two red lips, which the favourite of the SUITAN

ignorance of European politics, “How do you like your profession?”
Iasked, wanting to make copy. “Oh, blow the profession,” sheanswered,
lightly sending the smoke of the exquisite Dubectoboccothrough her
gazelle-like nostrils. “Do you not like your career?” I inquired,
anxiously. “I’d far sooner be mangling,” she answered, taking a
drink of “Tom Cat.” “Hearts?” I interrogated roguishly. “No-
washing, you stupid,” she replied, with a chuckle ben trovato: “you
seem to be a bit balmy on the crumpet.” “I never eat the delicacy,”
I responded. “I represent the staff of social life, the Press.”.
GoosſE raised herself from the azure velvet cushion on which she

some starving bloke with thirty bob salary says about me?... Not
much. I'm a lady, and the managers know it.” “I’m sure I did
not wish to excite so talented an artiste,” I cried, repentantly; “but
I notice that you always advertise favourable newspaper criticism.”
“Oh! that's my agent's business,” she retorted, flic ing a peach-
stone at the mirrºr (peaches in January, ma chèreſ); “he's a regular
sniffer after black and white, and much good may it do him.”
At this moment an elderly female, who might have been an arch-
deacon's sister, appeared, and exclaimed, "Hurry up! You're
called, Goosie, dear.” “Oh! bother!” cried la belle chanteuse
flinging the end of her cigarette into the water-jug., “What do f

standing ready with a hare's foot – véritable pied de lièvre –

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
ON MAD Dogs.
I GATHER from the usual sources of information that we are now
in the midst of an epidemic of terror inspired by mad dogs. There
has been a leading article in the Times, and the great army of letter-
writers, each with his own special tale of horror, and his own patent
remedy, has invaded the solemn columns of the daily Press. “One
who Loves his Fellow-Men” has been joined in a muzzling crusade by
“Prevention is Better than Cure,” and “A Dog-Lover of Long
Standing” has demanded in tones of menace that members of the
tail-wagging fraternity shall be either confined constantly, within
their kennels, or shot, or bludgeoned at sight if they venture to
stray abroad in pursuit of those innocent but seemingly important
investigations that form so large a part in the life of a dog. County
Councils have taken action. The sages who control the affairs of
London, having declined to impose a covering on their own baldness,
have decided, by way of compensation, that the heads of all dogs in
their enlightened jurisdiction shall be confined in cages; and dull
men in every part of England, who have hitherto been content to
grumble at the rates, and to pay their butchers' bills with decent
regularity, are now swelling proudly with the new-born inspiration
of a muzzling mission.
“THIS is a dreadful business,” said my friend BROADBEAM to me
the other day, in a tone of the deepest gloom, “a dreadful business.
I don't know why the Government delay to take action.”
“Good Heavens,” said I, for I had not yet seen my evening papers,
and I jº. that possibly some new and totally unexpected crisis
had arisen for the benefit of Mr. ALFRED AUSTIN and the music-halls.
“Good Heavens ! what has happened? Has Venezuela broken loose
again and burnt Mr. GEORGE CUBzoN and Sir ELLIS ASHMEAD-
BARTLETT in effigy P Or has President KhüGER demanded the head
of Mr. CECIL RHoDEs on a charger ? Do not keep me in suspense,
BRQADBEAM; tell me what has happened, for I love my country, and
wish to know the worst.” -
“What!” asked BROADBEAM, his whole being shaking like a |
restive blanc-mange with suppressed fear; “do you mean to say you ||
haven't seen all the articles in the papers about rabies? %.
the whole place is full of mad dogs, and we shall all be bitten in our
beds.” BROADBEAM, I should explain, has a certain fondness for
expressing himself melodramatically, but not always with strict
appropriateness. No doubt he had read somewhere about people
being murdered in their beds.
I.TRIED to soothe my unfortunate friend, but the effort, though
well meant, was a wretched failure. He refused to be comforted,
and went off in a hansom. - Being a nervous man, he is not, as a
rule, addicted to hansoms; but, in his present state of terror, the
word “growler” was too fearfully suggestive, and the comfortable ||
customaly four-wheeler was abandoned. I have reason to believe
that the letter signed “A Conservative, but a Patriot,” which
appeared in a morning paper shortly afterwards, was from BRoan-
BEAM's indignant pen. The writer, it will be remembered, declared,
with a fine sarcasm, that Lord SALISBURY might possibly manage to
spare a moment or two from the miseries of the Armenians for the
sufferings of the English people at home. What was the object of
jº, despatches to the SULTAN when law-abiding Englishmen
were allowed to be made the victims of thousands of mad and prowl-
ing dogs? Had not the SULTAN a crushing retort ready to his hand?
“This question,” the writer concluded, “obliterates distinctions
of party. I have been a loyal supporter of the present Government,
but there are necessary limits even to party-loyalty, and, in my
case, these limits have been reached.”
HAVING digested this portentous declaration, I turned to the
sixty-ninth letter of “A. Citizen of the World” by OLIVER GoLD-
SMITH., It was entitled “The Fear of Mad Dogs Ridiguled,” and
gives a humorous account of the epidemic terror through which the
population of these islands was passing some hundred and thirty
years ago. “A dread of mad dogs,” he says, “is the epidemic
terror, which now prevails; and the whole nation is at present
actually groaning under the malignity of its influence. The people
sally from their houses with that circumspection which is prudent in
such as expect a mad dog at every turning. The physician publishes
his prescription, the beadle prepares his halter, and a few of unusual
bravery arm themselves with boots and buff gloves, in order to face
the enemy if he should offer to attack them. In short, the whole
people stand bravely upon their defence, and seem, by their present
spirit, to show a resolution of not being tamely bit by mad dogs any
longer. . . . The terror at first feebly enters with a disregarded
story of a little dog, that had gone through a neighbouring village,
that was thought to be mad by several who had seen him. The next
account comes that a mastiff ran through a certain town, and had
bit five geese, which immediately ran mad, foamed at the bill, and
died in great agonies soon after. . . . This relation º prepares
the way for another still more hideous, as how the master of a family,
with seven small children, were all bit by a mad lap-dog; and how
the poor father first perceived the infection by calling for a draught
of water, when he saw the lap-dog swimming in the cup. . . . y
landlady, a good-natured woman, but a little credulous, waked me
some mornings ago before the usual hour with horror and astonish-
ment in her looks...; Amad dog down in the country, she assured me,
had bit a farmer, who, soon becoming mad, ran into his own yard
and bit a fine brindled cow; the cow quickly became as mad as the
man, began to foam at the mouth, and raising herself up walked
about on her hind legs, sometimes barking like a dog, and sometimes
attempting to talk like the farmer. Upon examining the grounds of
this story, I found my landlady had it from one neighbour, who had
it from another neighbour, who had it from very good authority.”
WITH all our statistics, our sanitary inspectors, our County
Councils, and our wire muzzlings, I believe we are every whit as
foolish, as credulous, as liable to blind panic as were our forefathers
in GQIDSMITH's day. In any case, I am certain that of all possible
remedies the cage-muzzle is the most absurd, in that it defeats its
object, and is i. calculated to promote the disease against
which it is to guard us. But, I have my consolations. In another
month or two the country gentlemen of England will be sending up
deputations, and announcing in the public prints that they are
resolved to vote against a Government which has basely allowed dogs
to be muzzled.
THEATRICAL ON DIT-In consequence of the success of The Sign
of the Cross, the temporary manager of the Lyric, following the
example of Mr. William Stumps, as recorded in Pickwick, has now

CONDENSED CONFIDENCE. (For Ladies only.)
DEAREST ETHELINDA, It was with trembling Trilbys (we never
speak of vulgar feet now) that I was ushered into the dressing-room
of Miss Goosie GANDER, the charming young cantatrice (she pleads
to eighteen years of the Mansion House. Theatre of Varieties. I was
> soon chez moi, when GoosſE (she
begged me to be familiar as
soon as I had introduced my-
ſelf) asked me to take a chair,
and join her in a “Tom Cat”
(a mixture of gin and brandy),
and a cigarette. Her courtesy
gave me time to look round
this dainty little den of refined
dissipation. The furniture was
what I would style rococo, and
the pictures were mainly por-
traits of my hostess from fa-
yourite weekly papers, fastened
to the unromantic wall-paper
with hair-pins. Of course I
noted, amid the abandon of dis-
carded chevelure and necessary
cosmétiques, quite a little pile of
cºrrespondence—many of the
letters with coronets on the envelopes—flanked by bouquets of orchids
and roses, and sundry little morocco cases, which, were I in ever-
beautiful Paris, I should suggest contained les bijouz de la reine.
I observed, too, that the old cheval mirror was severely cracked in
several pl"; (could it have been by reason of Goosſe's lightning
lances? Quien sabe? as they say in Cuba), and that my hostess's
avourite face-powder was Folle-Farine, the delicate violet requisite
just evolved from the laboratory of TARTINE & Co. of Bond Street.
Goosie, happily for fearsome Me, opened the ball, “How,” she
asked, with her winsome Whitechapel accent, which I will not
attempt to reproduce, “do you like my togs? They're up to snuff
I take it.” I replied that her garments, though, perhaps, deficient
in warmth, were quite capable of carrying several pounds of crushed
* *
flash from her great emerald eyes, “Don’t try spoof with me.” I
earnestly disclaimed any attempt to indulge in a sport which I had
heard of as tant soit pew chic. Goosſº smiled languidly, the sort of
risible separation of two red lips, which the favourite of the SUITAN
might give when the Commander of the Faithful declares his
ignorance of European politics, “How do you like your profession?”
Iasked, wanting to makecopy, “Oh, blowtheprofession,” sheanswered,
lightly sending the smoke of the exquisite Dubectoboccothrough her
gazelle-like nostrils. “Do you not like your career?” I inquired,
anxiously._"I’d far sooner be mangling,” she answered, taking a
drink of “Tom Cat.” “Hearts?” I interrogated roguishly. “No-
washing, you stupid,” she replied, with a chuckle ben trovato: “you
seem to be a bit balmy on the crumpet.” “I never eat the delicacy,”
I responded. “I represent the staff of social life, the Press.”.
Goosſe raised herself from the azure velvet cushion on which she
WaS ſº “Look here,” she ejaculated. “if you imagine I care
one and ninepence three-farthings for the Press, {*. 're jolly well
mistaken. I can cut my º: sing .# songs, and do my patter to
the tune of a hundred quid a week, and do you think I mind what
some starving bloke with thirty bob salary says about me?... Not
much. I'm a lady, and the managers know it.” “I’m sure I did
not wish to excite so talented an artiste,” I cried, repentantly; “but
I notice that you always advertise favourable newspaper criticism.”
“Oh! that's my agent's business,” she retorted, flicking a peach-
stone at the mirror (peaches in January, ma chère (); “he's a regular
sniffer after black and white, and much good may it do him.”
At this moment an elderly female, who might have been an arch-
deacon's sister, appeared, and exclaimed, “ Hurry up! You’re
called, Goosie, dear.” “Oh! bother!” cried la belle chanteuse
flinging the end of her cigarette into the water-jug. “What do f
start with?” “The Flatcatcher and the Bird,” replied the duonna,
standing ready with a hare's foot – véritable pied de lièvre –
anointed with some delicate pink bloom. “Dead cats to the con-
ductor!” said GoosſE, pettishly. “I told him that I wanted to try
‘Tripe and Onions d la mode,’ and my brother and his pals are in

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
ON MAD Dogs.
I GATHER from the usual sources of information that we are now
in the midst of an epidemic of terror inspired by mad dogs. There
has been a leading article in the Times, and the great army of letter-
writers, each with his own special tale of horror, and his own patent
remedy, has invaded the solemn columns of the daily Press. “One
who Loves his Fellow-Men” has been joined in a muzzling crusade by
“Prevention is Better than Cure,” and “A Dog-Lover of Long
Standing” has demanded in tones of menace that members of the
tail-wagging fraternity shall be either confined constantly within
their kennels, or shot, or bludgeoned at sight if they venture to
stray abroad in pursuit of those innocent but seemingly important
É.iº. that form so large a part in the life of a dog. County
Councils have taken action. The sages who control the affairs of
London, having declined to impose a covering on their own baldness,
have decided, by way of compensation, that the heads of all dogs in
their enlightened jurisdiction shall be confined in cages; and dull
men in every part of England, who have hitherto been content to
grumble at the rates, and to pay their butchers' bills with decent
regularity, are now swelling proudly with the new-born inspiration
of a muzzling mission.
“THIS is a dreadful business,” said my friend BROADBEAM to me
the other day, in a tone of the deepest gloom, “a dreadful business.
I don't know why the Government delay to take action.”
44 Heavens,” said I, for I had not yet seen my evening papers,
and I thought that possibly some new and totally unexpected crisis
had arisen for the benefit of Mr. ALFRED AUSTIN and the music-halls.
“Good Heavens! what has happened? Has Venezuela broken loose
again and burnt Mr. GeoRGE CUBzoN and Sir ELLIS ASHMEAD-
BARTLETT in effigy P Or has President KhüggR demanded the head
of Mr. CECIL RHoDEs on a charger ? Do not keep me in suspense,
-
BRQADBEAM; tell me what has happened, for I love my country, and
wish to know the worst.”
“What!” asked BRoadBEAM, his whole being shaking like a
restive blanc-mange with suppressed fear; “do you mean to say you
haven't seen all the articles in the papers about rabies? hy
the whole place is full of mad dogs, and we shall all be bitten in our
beds.” Broadbeamſ, I should explain, has a certain fondness for
expressing himself melodramatically, but not always with strict
appropriateness. No doubt he had read somewhere about people
being murdered in their beds.
I.TRIED to soothe my unfortunate friend, but the effort, though
well meant, was a hed failure. He refused to be comforted,
and went off in a hansom. Being a nervous man, he is not, as a
rule, addicted to hansoms; but, in his present state of terror, the
word “growler” was too fearfully suggestive, and the comfortable
customaly four-wheeler was abandoned. I have reason to believe
that the letter signed “A Conservative, but a Patriot,” which
appeared in a morning paper shortly afterwards, was from BRoad-
BEAM's indignant pen. The writer, it will be remembered, declared,
with a fine sarcasm, that Lord SALISBURY might possibly manage to
spare a moment or two from the miseries of the Armenians for the
sufferings of the English people at home. What was the object of
writing despatches to the SULTAN when law-abiding Englishmen
were allowed to be made the victims of thousands of mad and prowl-
ing dogs? Had not the SULTAN a crushing retort ready to his hand?
“This question,” the writer concluded, "obliterates all distinctions
of party. I have been a loyal supporter of the present Government,
but there are necessary limits even to iº. and, in my
case, these limits have been reached.”
HAVING, digested this portentous declaration, I turned to the
sixty-ninth letter of “A Citizen of the World” by OLIVER GoLD-
sMIth. . It was entitled “The Fear of Mad Dogs Ridiculed,” and
gives a humorous account of the epidemic terror through which the
population of these islands was passing some hundred and thirty
years ago. “A dread of, mad dogs,” he says, “is the epidemic
terror, which now prevails; and the whole nation is at present
actually groaning under the malignity of its influence. The people
sally from their houses with that circumspection which is prudent in
such as expect a mad dog at every turning. The physician publishes
his prescription, the beadle prepares his halter, and a few of unusual
bravery arm themselves with boots and buff gloves, in order to face
the enemy if he should offer to attack them. In short, the whole
people stand bravely upon their defence, and seem, by their present
spirit, to show a resolution of not being tamely bit by mad dogs an
longer. . . . The terror at first feebly enters with a disregarde
story of a little dog, that had gone through a neighbouring village,
that was thought to be mad by several who had seen him. The next
account comes that a mastiff ran through a certain town, and had
bit five geese, which immediately ran mad, foamed at the bill, and
died in great agonies, soon after. . . . This relation º prepares
the way for another still more hideous, as how the master of a family,
with seven small children, were all bit by a mad lap-dog; and how
the poor father first perceived the infection by calling for a draught
of water, when he saw the lap-dog swimming in the cup. . . . . My
landlady, a good-natured woman, but a little credulous, waked me
some mornings ago before the usual hour with horror and astonish-
ment inherlooks.... Amad dog down in the country, she assured me,
had bit a farmer, who, soon becoming mad, ran into his own yard
and bit a fine brindled cow; the cow quickly became as mad as the
man, began to foam at the mouth, and raising herself up walked
about on her hind legs, sometimes barking like a dog, and sometimes
attempting to talk like the farmer. Upon examining the grounds of
this story, I found my landlady had it from one neighbour, who had
it from another neighbour, who had it from very good authority.”
WITH all our statistics, our sanitary inspectors, our County
Councils, and our wire muzzlings, I believe we are every whit as
foolish, as credulous, as liable to blind panic as were our forefathers
in GoLDSMITH's day. In any case, I am certain that of all possible
remedies the cage-muzzle is the most absurd, in that it defeats its
object, and is admirably calculated to promote the disease against
which it is to guard us. But I have my consolations. In another
month or two the country gentlemen of England will be sending up
deputations, and announcing in the public prints that they are
resolved to vote against a Government which has basely allowed dogs
to be muzzled.
THEATRICAL ON DIT.-In consequence of the success of The Sign
of the Cross, the temporary manager of the Lyric, following the
example of Mr. William Stumps, as recorded in Pickwick, has now
adopted the following signature, “WILson BARRETT : HIS MARK X.”
W. B. may have been a long time in “making his mark,” but he has
done it at -

THE NEW SPORT OF “THANKFULLY RECEIVED.”
Rules of the Game,
1. ANY number of players can take part in this pastime.
2. The players s consist of a limited number of conductors and
any amount of distinguished contributors.
3. When all is ready to begin, the conductor writes out a number
of questions of a miscellaneous character, such as “What is your
opinion upon street music?” “Why do you or do you not patronise
e Stores?” or “What are your favourite books, and why do you
prefer them?” - - - - -
4. The conductor then, distributes the written questions amongst
the distinguished contributors, and waits for the answers, which,
when received, count as “copy.”
5. If the conductor gets a reply to some such question as “Should
the clergy visit theatres?” from the Archbishop of CANTERBURY, he
scores one on account of the quality of the copy.
6. Should a question remain unanswered by a player, the conductor
passes it on to the most likely distinguished contributor, and the
non-answerer becomes a non-contributor, and ceases to have an
interest in the game. -
7. Should a distinguished contributor require payment for his
answer, considering it copy, the conductor withdraws the question
and sends it to someone of the non-contributor's profession and
standing unlikely to demand remuneration. When the conductor
receives a gratuitous reply he scores again.
8. When the conductor uses a contributor to obtain answers to a
series of questions (called an “interview”) from a second player,
then the chosen contributor may ask to divide the profits of the
interview with the conductor. Should the chosen contributor
succeed in his application, he marks one, but the second player,
however distin ed, having served his purpose in providing the
materials of the interview, does not count. - -
9. A conductor who sends out scores of circulars without eliciting
a reply is said to “miss his tip,” and is consequently, “put out.”
10. The winner of the game is he who obtains the best copy at the

WORTH OF IT THE OTHER DAY.”
EH ! I Bought TEN PounDs
--
Brown, “What A Lor YoU MUST HAVE GOT 1"
THE FALL OF FOGSON.
Fogson had been absent for more than a
year from the meetings of our F.º.
club, and most of us would have bornethe loss
with some fortitude if he had never returned
at all. It was undeniable that Fogson took
better photographs than the rest of us, but
this fact did not justify the disparaging and
offensive criticisms which he used to utter
about the work of his fellow-members. In
his capacity as President, he had even had the
effrontery to bestow the annual gold medal
upon himself, while declining to award the
silver and bronze ones “on accrunt of the
exºdingly low standard attained by the
exhibitors.”
So it was not with unmixed sorrow that one
day we learnt from Fogson his intention of
making a tour round the world.
“I shall return,” he said, “with such a
collection of pictures, as you, incompetent
*g. cannot even imagine.”
omebody suggested that his luggage would
be rather heavy, if it was to include all his
apparatus.
“Not at all,” he replied, triumphantly.
“I shall take only one detective-camera, spe-
cially fitted with a film long enough to take
five hundred pictures. That will be abso-
lutely all.”
Someone else regretted that spaca cyuldn't
he found for at least one clean collar. But
Fogson took no notice of the irreverent sug-
gestion, and shortly afterwards went away to
obtain his new “Dokak” from the shop, as
he was to leave England on the following day.
We got on very well in his absence. All
good that year that we decided to award
twenty-four gold medals. Our club has just
two dozen members, not including Fogson.
One evening, about thirteen months later,
our President suddenly re appeared in our
midst. We asked if his tour had been suc-
cessful. “Successful!” he exclaimed. “It
has been magnificent! My dear friends, you
may congratulate me. I have taken such a
series of photographs as will give me world-
wide fame. I have undergone the most un-
heard-of dangers and privations; I have
climbed to the most inaccessible s of the
earth; I have been lowered in diver's dress,
with my camera, to the bottom of the Pacific;
I have photographed a volcano infull eruption
from the edge of the crater, I–”
We interrupted his eloquence to inquire
when the results of his journey would be
visible.
“Almost at once,” he replied. “I tent on
my “Dokak' in advance to Messrs. LENs AND
HYPo's, telling them to develop my pictures,
and to send the prints here. They may arrive
at any time.”
At this moment a page entered the room
with a note, which he handed to Fogson.
“Ah, this is from the shop,” he said,
quickly tearing it open: “ now we'll see . . .
why. . . good heavens!” He suddenly became
deadly pale, and staggered backwards into a
chair. For a moment we thought that he
was about to have a fit.
“Read it!” he said, in a faint voice, drop-
ping the letter to the ground. The secretary
picked it up, and read aloud as follows:-
“DEAR SIR,-Your camera is duly to hand.
We regret to say, however, that through an
which your order had to be executed—no roll
of sensitized film was Pººl inside it. Thus,
although the rest of the mechanism is in
perfect order, there is, of course, no record of
any of the scenes which you imagined your-
self to be photographing, as the interior of
the camera is absºlutely empty.”
The Presidentship was declared vacant next
day, and Fogson has not been heard of since.
THE PLEA OF PILGARLIC.
(The Impecunious Income-taa: Payer to the Jingo
Patriot.)
“PAP up like a man, and don't grudge it!”
..That’s grand patriotic advice.
Sir MICHAEL projecting his Budget,
No doubt feels exceedingº: nice:
But oh! when I have to make payment
Of eightpence—or more—in the pound,
My wife, running short of new raiment,
ill not look so nice, I’ll be bound.
The last three years' average, verily,
Makes me feel sad and look glum.
Patriots perorate merrily,
I—pay my tax and am dumb.
But Toh l CLEVELAND, KRügee, RHOLEs,
WILL-I-AM,
And backers of JAMEson's raid, , .
Can you guess how alarmed at the bill I am,
Or with what sore effort ’tis paid P
When one has a limited income
A{...} one, thoughts will obtrude;
Wild wondering whence will the tin come;
And oh!, tax-collectors are rudel
With a rather exacting Exchequer,
And agents capricious and curt,
'Tisn't easy to keep up one's pecker,
Or even to keepin one's shirt. -
When a big tax is claimed in a lump, it
Comes hard on a purse that is small,
I fear I shall “go off my crumpº »
As taxes arise, and “screws” fall. . .
Some “returns” are far less than receivings,
But mine, I admit it, are more.
Both *: no doubt, are deceivings,
But ohl to be sniffed at as poor

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House ºf Commons, Tuesday, February 11,–Gathering of clans
for new campaign. Customary competition for niche in history
reserved for first man to put in appearance on opening of new session.
But the race only half-hearted. Brings into sharp light the falling-
off since the good old days when DoNALD MACFARLANE, returned for
Argyllshire, made his earliest mark. No half measures with that
stout Highlander. Camped out in Palace Yard at nightfall preceding
opening of session. His plaid wrapped round his swarthy limbs; a
flask of Scotch whiskey hidden in its folds; at hand a small sack of
oatmeal cake, which served a double debt to pay; a pillow to begin
with; gradually thinned out as hunger grew, till its emptiness gave
the signal to arise.
Used to be tradition among police on duty in those far-off days
that pigeons in Palace Yard, having dim notions of treasured nursery
tales, thought MACFARLANE was a Nineteenth Century Babe in the
ood. Being early in February, no leaves handy; brought straws
and tenderly covered him. That probably mythical addition to
simple facts of original story.
o similar foundation available to-day. The earliest Member
arrives at prosaic noon; the rest troop in till, an hour before Mr.
SPFAKER makes stately procession on way to Chair, the long-deserted
House once more throbs with life. Everybody almost #.
3. to see everyone else after separation which, after all, seems to
ate back only a week. Customary February allowance of sun-
light. But SQUIRE of MALwood makes up for deficiency in that
matter. Passes through the throng like broad beam of sunlight;
his whole face and figure a smile.
“Yes, Toby,” he said, when I remarked on his contagious hilarity;
“I begin to think life is worth living. After three last years,
reckon I have earned right to enjoy myself, and forthwith begin.
Only thing that troubles me is consideration of PRINCE ARTHUR's
position. Better than mine was, of course. Got majority behind him
which would enable him to snap his fingers at anything on his side
which corresponds to our Irish section, our Welsh, our Whigs, our
Radicals, our men who want to go too far in a dozen different direc-
tions, our friends who will not accompany them. Moreover, he has
the colleagueship of Don Josf, and what that means, either in
Cabinet Council or in other relations of political comradeship, only
those who have º: it know. Still there are cares and worries
which sit around the pillow of Leader of House of Commons even
through most restful nights, and in balmiest morning. Maggots
breed under brilliancy of noontide sun. Now is the very height of
prosperity for our dear friends opposite. An overwhelming majority;
a docile following; overflowing coffers (which I heaped up); a
powerful Navy (which SPENCER built); the cloud of depression that
has long laid over trade uplifted; a fair wind, a flowing tide. Never
in my recollection—and Iremember Dizzy's coming-in in 1874-never
was there such a putting forth to sea of the Conservative argosy. And
you know how, even in the second voyage of Dizzy's ship, the seas
grew troubled, how storms increased, and how total wreckage befel.
No, I’m not chuckling over that prospect as looming along the path-
way of this latest voyage. Enough for me that I am out of the conning-
tower, and can commence once more to enjoy Parliamentary life.”
“And your policy as Leader of the º ?” - - -
“Did you ever,” said the SquEEE, with far away look in his eyes,
“hear of the habitual resource of Brer Rabbit in times of sudden
emergency or apparently inextricable difficulty P ‘He lay low and
said muffin.” There you have it, dear Toby. As far as I am con-
cerned, or can control what is left of the Liberal Party, for the present,
at least, our's shall be the policy of Brer Rabbit.” -
Business done.—Second Session of Fourteenth Parliament of
Queen VICTORIA opened.
WEATHER AND WICE.
[Mr. LINNEy, director of the Illinois State
Weather Bureau, says that the total number of
arrests shows a marked increase of crime with an
increase of temperature, and when there is a
deficiency of rainfall. There is a decrease of crime
during the winter months, also when there is a
rainy summer, and when the wind is from the
south-east or south-west.]
I KNEw 'twas so! When earth and sky
Announce the spring to human senses
Do I not always yearn to try
A little coup in false pretences?
In sheets of rain and seas of slime
Perhaps our summer's been a sparse’un;
Then, something whispers, “Now's your
10ne
To show the world your skill in arson l’”
Conversely, when I’d take a shot
At being a homicidal hero,
My inward monitor says, “What!
Wouldstmurder with the glass at zero?”
And when I poached, I should have netted
Ten toothsome bunnies at the least,
Had not the wind—which I regretted-
Turned suddenly to sou'-sou'-east.
So when I tried embezzlement,
Why did the crime stick in my gizzard P
What was it baulked my vile intent?
A bobby ? No, it was a blizzard.
And here’s a fact on LINNEY's side—
Our culprits recognise it daily-
E’en j the air be cold outside,
They get it hot at the Old Bailey!
Church and Stage.
'Twixt preacher dull and actor, there

INGOLDSBY AND SHAKSPEARE.
bº won't-won't he? Then bring me my boots!” said the
aron.”
Now this quotation is from the tale of Grey Dolphin, which, as
eyerybody knows who reads, or has read, anything, is one of the prose
stories included in the Ingoldsby Legends written by the Rev. Richard
HARRIs BARHAM. Les grands esprits serencontrent occasionally,
and in this matter of “boots” SHARspeARE anticipated Ingoldsby.
Turn to Richard the Second, Act W., Sc. 2. I give it compressed:-
“Duke of York. Give me my boots, I say!
[Erit servant for boots.
: Duchess. . What is the matter?
“York. Bring me my boots.”. (This he must shout loudly as the
servant, according to stage direction above, has gone for them.) “I
will unto the king.
“Re-enter servant with boots.
- * (to servant). Hence, villain! never more come in my
81ght.
[It was a nice family to live in. Duchess is nowpreventing servant
from handing boots to Duke, while their son AUMERLE is
standing by. . Pretty domestic scene in High life /
“York (naturally irritated). Give me my jº say!”
But the Duchess won't let him have his boots. During the
remainder of the scene, while the servant, who remains on the stage,
must be dodging about trying his best to give the Duke his boots,
and AUMERLE is º the scene quietly, the Duchess, now
throwing herself on her knees before her husband, now embracing
him, now clinging to him, is perpetually Pºinº: Duke from
sitting down quietly and putting on his boots. Finally, utterly
exasperated, the Duke exclaims:-
violently, followed, of course, by “servant with boots.” SHAKSPEARE,
whose genius never disdained trifles, makes far more out of the Duke's
boots than does Ingoldsby of the Baron's. -
Should Mr. Forbes Robehtson well and wisely determine on
reviving this play of SHAKSPEARE's, himself taking the part of the
unhappy King Richard the Second, with whom the audience must
always bein sympathy, may I hope that he will give due prominence
to this particular scene, and will take great care that the property
boots be effective? The Duke of Pork should be played § Mr.
TERRIss, specially engaged. He can “make-up elderly”; and then
how finely would he thunder forth “Give me my boots l’ For the
Duchess, who has to implore him on her knees, let the part be confided
to Mrs. PATRICK CAMPBELL. Mr. ALEXANDER should play Aumerle;
and the part of the servant, who brings in the boots, on whose
business with the Duke and Duchess, and on whose facial expression
the entire effect of the scene depends, might be safely entrusted to
Mr. PENLEY, whose performance in dumb show, when, with the big
boots in his hand, he tries to dodge the Duchess, would attract the
whole of London. Mr. FoEBEs Robertson will do well to consider
this friendly hint from A. P. DE BOTTEs.

WHAT OUR NOVELIST HAS TO PUT UP WITH.
His little Grandson is made to write (under dictation) to unknown
enthusiastic American admirer of his works:–"DEAR MADAM,-
GRANDPAPA - wishEs ME. To white AND THANK You For Your
PhotoGPAPH, AND For You R KIND LETTER. To HIM, IN which You
8AY YOU WOULD SO LIKE TO CROSS THE ATLANTIC AND MAKE HIS
ACQUAINTANCE, SO THAT WHAT IS DIVINE IN YOU MAY HAVE AN OPPOR-
TUNITY OF MINGLING WITH WHAT IS DIVINE IN GRANDPAPA.
“GRANDPAPA THINKs IT would BE VERY NICE INDEED, on LY
HE's VERY BUsy JUST Now ; AND BESIDEs, HE's AFRAID GRAND- |;
So, PERHAPs, you'd BETTER Not.
“You Rs TRULY, JACK BoomER.
"P.S.–GRANDPAPA can’t send You HIs PHOTOGRAPH, As HE
HASN'T BEEN TAKEN FOR THIRTY-FIVE YEARs.”
MAMMA MIGHT OBJECT.
ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
ON CoIDs.
PRIOR, I believe, tells us that—
“Each changing season does its poison bring;
Rheums chill the winter, agues #. the spring.”
Or, as CALVERLEY puts it, in words even more forcible, the winter
s the season when—
* M’s and n’s are mostl
Pronounced like b's and d’s.”
With me a cold does not take precisely that form, but it is, even
without these mispronunciations, a serious and melancholy catas-
trophe; and, while it lasts, takes from life all that ordinarily makes
life pleasant. I do not wish to intrude º personal sorrows
upon the reading public, but after all in this matter, as I take it
the §: and discomforts through which I struggle by the aid of
hot drinks, handkerchiefs, and the other infernal paraphernalia
of this minor fever, have been endured to an equal extent by the
public at large. Now, nothing more consoles an invalid than to
recount his desperate woes to his friends, and to assure himself of
their sympathy by allowing them in turn—not at the same length,
of course: no man's illness is ever so serious as one's own—to com-
municate, their distressing symptoms to him. Let me, therefore,
put myself in an entirely impartial #: and imagine that in
reciting my own experiences I am really listening to those of a very
dear and intimate friend—which is, indeed, the case.
THE beginnings, then, of the golds to which my friend is occasion-
ally a martyr, are º sudden and explosive. At one moment
he walks erect, proud in the consciousness of perfect health. His
eye is undimmed, his mind is clear, his muscles are firmly braced,
his voice is resonant. Then, without a warning, three terrible deto-
nations shake the house in quick succession. There comes a pause,
and then two more rend the rafters. He has sneezed five times—
the number five is fatal to him—and he knows that a cold has him
in its clutches. At these well-known and terrific sounds the estab-
lishment is convulsed. “He’s got it,” the butler remarks to the
cook, “Yes, and it’s a bad one. He's managed to keep it off a
good long time this season, but I knew it had got to come, MARY,
put his blue shawl in his bed, make up his fire, and don't forget the
hot-water bottle.” At these words from the mistress of the kitchen,
the housemaid bustles .# to make the ºustomary preparations,
and the butler, having placed his master's slippers by the fire, imme-
diately busies himself with the brew of a jorum of port-wine negus
or mulled claret, specifics sanctified by a long household tradition as
the first line of defence, the domestic navy, against the treacherous
attacks of the cold-fiend.
THE five sneezes have been the signal for the mobilisation of the
home army. No further orders are required from the unfortunate
master, even if he were capable of giving any, But as for him, the
well-cushioned seat of his arm-chair receives him. There he reclines,
huddled, a mere semblance of a man, now racked with despair, now
tortured with illusive hope, and the walls re-echo with the trumpet
sounds of his affliction. Not otherwise an º: borne aloft upon the
invincible power of spreading wings, beholds upon the plain below
a kid, sporting in the meadows. Downward he starts from the upper
heights, his fierce spirit aflame with the desire of prey, ruffled as to
his haughty, plumage, and, with rending beak and greedy talons
seizes the soft offspring of the mother-goat. In vain its bleatings fill
the air; in vain its sorrowing parents and the flocks of the shepherds
pour forth lamentations, and witness each departure with black
grief wing at their hearts, º and ever up, soars the kingly
bird, depositing his prize, at length, in his eyrie, a feast not unap-
Fººtº by the partner of his throne and her soft-plum
ut, below, the mother-goat is desolate, nor do the rich pastures
give her comfort. So a cold— Well, in fact, to finish with the
simile, the cold is as an eagle, the cold's victim is as the kid; and
beyond a general resemblance, it is never possible to press a simile
in the classic form.
BUT, as I said, the sufferer lies in his armchair, and at first he
hopes. A coldl pooh, the notion is absurd. The weather is warm
and spring-like; he has not been conscious of damp socks or sitting
in draughts, or any other rashness. It can't be a real cold; merely
a fit of sneezing which will pass away and leave no trace. So he
thinks, but all the time there are little creeping shivers, the demon's
antennae, playing up and down his spine; his skin turns to that of
a goose; The shifts himself closer and closer to the fire...without
; any warmth; his hair seems endowed with a malignantly
independent existence; each separate hair begins to .. then

ence, and eventually the careful butler enters unsummoned with a
relay of dry, handkerchiefs, on a tray, and an announcement that
dinner will be ready shortly, that he doesn't suppose his master
intends to dress, and will he have the usual amount of sugar in the
hot port wine. After this, only one hope remains. He lights, a
cigarette. Misery—he cannot taste it. Then heis, indeed, in for a cold.
No matter: it shall be checked-nipped in the bud. Feed a cold
and starve a fever; wherefore, immense quantities of food are con-
sumed—and all to no awaii. For the han erchief, the white flag of
surrender, flutters without º the eyes pour with copious tears,
the tongue is parched. And as he enters his bedroom the sufferer
sees the ancient blue shawl deftly and invitingly spread, the shawl
that is brought out only for these calamities, and retires to its
cupboard with reluctance long after all danger is over; and a bulge
in the bedclothes proclaims that beneath that spot, lies, snugly
nestling the hot-water bottle which is to spread its comfort from the
feet upward through the whole system, and bake him in his bed. I
need not protract the pitiful story. Men laugh at colds, but for real
misery, for the misery which leaving you strength takes away joy,
which tosses and tortures and roasts and freezes, which tears you
and then tears each separate piece, which makes tobacco a loathing,
and robs even a Norwegian anchovy of taste—for such, a misery.as
this there is only one name, and the name is Cold. May it perish
from the land.

“BETRAYED BY THE INTERWIEWER!”
(Fragment from a Matter-of-fact Romance )
RUPRRT had done his best to conciliate the representative of The
Detectire, the newest of the long series of interviewing periodicals.
He had lunched him, smoked with him, joked with him. He
believed that he had created a favourable impression. If he had to
complain of anything, it was of the scanty attention ſaid to his
stories, and the noise made by an apparatus that was brought into his
study by the investigator.
“You will let me see the article when it appears,” said RUPERT,
as he bade his guest farewell.
“Certainly,” was the answer; and the two men parted.
“I trust that he will not omit my narrative of good work and good
deeds,” thought the now lonely celebrity; “if he sets down all I
related, I shall appear as a hero and a saint. And why not?”
A fºrtnight later and the two were once again face to face. But
now RUPERT was furious.
“What do you mean, Sir, by proving me to be a coward and an
imposter?” he shouted.
“Imerely reproduced your thoughts,” was the calm response.
“But I told you nothing to my disadvantage,” cried RUPERT,
...}; “How can you know what was passing through my

when I brought it with me into your study.”
“I do not understand you.”
“You will when I tell you that I photographed the *ś of
your brain, and thus learned the secrets you would have hidden from
me! And now I will explain scientifically—”
tº. RUPERT heard no more. The unfortunate celebrity had
ainted!
New TITLE (suggested by the Right Hon. J. Ch-mb-rl-n).-
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THE Chief of O.B.O. is not addicted to strong language, but, havin
perused all the stories in The Sand Sea, he takes his Davey, whi
expression, whatever it may otherwise imply, means, in this in-
stance, his “Richard DAvey,” author of this work, that rarely
has he come across so good a compilation of short stories-all telling
and all well told, none of them ºccupying more than the space of a
thorough reader's “s half-hour”—as he has found in the small
volume (title mentioned above) published by the Roxburgh Press.
No “problems” or mysteries among them. “Darey sum, non
QEdipus,” says, in effect, the author. “I recommend the volume to
all, and, more Olireri, ask for more,” says THE BARON.
“Police!”—“Hardly a week has passed without complaints being
lcdged with the police,” wrote the Pall Mall Gazette, à propºs of
brutal murder at Muswell Hill. The paragraph finished with “As
get the police hare no clue.”. Whatl not with, all these “com-
plaints lodged with the police” almost every week“for some months
past”!! Then follows”. The police theory is"—and, so forth; Of
what use is “theory” of police, as against “practice” of burglars?
When “Preventive Force,” after being specially, warned, does no
“prevent,” there is evidently something organically wrong.
“ON. SrANLEY, ON.”—Thus we address that talented actress, Miss
ALMA STANLEY, who, after reports all to the contrary, nevertheless
and notwithstanding, is alive, and, we trust, well. “On, STANLEY,
on”—the stage again!

JOTTINGS AND TITTLINGS.
(By BABoo HURRY BUNGsHo JABBERJEE, B.A.)
NO. W.
In which Mr. Jabberjee expresses his Opinions on Bicycling
as a Pastime.
In consequence of the increasing demands of the incomparable
Miss JEssIMINA upon the dancing attendance of your humble
servant, I am lately become as idle as a newly painted ship, and have
Gooroos who lecture in
not drunk in the legal wisdom of the learn
the hall of my Inn of Court, or opened the ponderous treatise of
Hon’ble Justice BLACKSTONE or DISON on Torts, for many a
blank day.
Still, as Philosopher PLATO observed, "Nihil humani alienum a
me puto,” and my time has not been actually squandered in the theft
of Procrastination, but rather employed in the proper study of Man-
kind, and acquiring a more complete knowingness in Ars Vivendi,
So I think it worth to direct public attention to the dangers of a
practice which threatens to developinto an epidemical kind of #.
and carry the deteriorating trails of a serpent over our house old
families, unless promptly scotched by benevolent firmness of a
paternal Government.
Need Iexplain Iamalluding
to the nowaday passion for
propelling oneself at a severe
speed by dint of unstable and
most precarious machinery?
It is now the exception
which breaks the e to
take the air in the streets
without being startled by
the unseemly spectacles of
go-ahead citizens straddled
upon such revolutionary con-
trivances, threading their
way with breakneck velocity
under the very noses of
omnibus and other horses,
and ringing the shrillwelkin
of a tintinnabulating gong l
Nay, even after the Cur-
few has taken its toll from
the knell of parting day, and
darkness reigns supreme,
they will urge on their wild
career, illuminated by the
dim religious light of a
small oil lampl
I. possess no, knack, of
medical knowledge, but I
boldly state my opinion that
such daredevilry must neces-
sarily inflict a deleterious
result to the nervous or—
ganisms of these riders; and,
who knows, of their posterity?
For no one can expect to
have hairbreadth escapes
from the running gauntlet
continuously, without suffering a shatterin
catastrophes of fatal injury to life and f
rigueur.
Experto crede-for I can support my obiter dictum by the crushing
internal panic, while
mb have become de
weight of personal experience. A few mornings since I had the
honour to escort Miss JESSIMINA MANKLETow and a middle-aged
select female boarder into the interior of Hyde Park. The day was
fine, though frigid, and I was wearing my fur-lined overcoat, with
boots of patent Japan leather, and a Bombay gold-embroidered Cap,
so that I was a mould of form and the howling nob.
Picture my amazement when, as I promenaded the path beside the
waters of the Serpentine lake, I beheld a wheeled cavalcade of every
90nceivable age, sex, and appearanee; senile gaffers and baby bunt-
ings; multitudinous women, some plump as a duckling, others thin

..Qn seeing which, the matured lady boarder did exclaim upon the
difficulties of the performance, and the vast crowd that had collected
to view such a tour de force, but II, perceiving that those seated
upon the, machines used no, exorbitant exertions, and, indeed,
appeared to be wholly, engrossed in social intercourse, responded that
no skill was required, to circulate these bicycles, which, owing to
being .surrounded with air-cushions, would proceed proprio motu
and without meandering.
myself upon one of these same machines, and—as we were now close
|to the effigy of Hon’ble Duke of WELLINGTON disguised, as an
Achilles, near which were certain bunniahs trafficking with bicycles
–I, wishing to pleasure my fair companion, approached one of
these contractors and bargained with him for the sole user of his
vehicle for the space of one calendar hour, to which he consented at
the honorarium of one rupee four annas. -
But, on receiving the bicycle from his hands, I at once perceived
myself under a total impossibility of achieving its ascent-for no
sooner had I protruded one leg over the saddle than the foremost
wheel averted itself, and the entire machine bit the dust, which
afforded lively and infinite entertainment to my feminine companions.
I, however, reproached the bunniah for furnishing a worn-out
effete affair that was not in working order or a going concern, but
he, by assuring me that it was all º cajoled me into ºf Once
more. So, divesting myself of my fur-lined overcoat, which I com-
manded a hobbardy .# of the sweeper class to hold, I again mounted
upon the saddle, while the proprietor of the machine sustained it
“I instantaneously endured the total upset !”
in a position of rectitude, and then, supporting me by the superfluity
of my pantaloons, he º me from the rear, counselling me to
| press my feet vigorously upon the paddles. But it all proved as the
abour of Sisyphus, for the seat was of sadly insufficient dimensions
and adamantine hardihood,
ºzº and whenever the bicycle-
man released his hold,
instantaneously endured the
total upset ! -
Then again Ireproved him
for his Punica fides, inform-
ing him that I required, a
machine that would run with
smooth progressiveness, pre:
cisely similar to those I
beheld in motion around me.
To which he replied that I
must not expect to be able to
ride impromptu as well as
. . individuals who had only
a mastered, the accomplish-
ment. by long continuity of
practice and industry.
“Oh, man of wilytºngue! y)
I addressed him. “Not thus
ill you bamboozle my
supposed simplicity! For if
the art were indeed so diffi-
cult as you pretend, how
should it be acquired by so
many timid and delicate
feminines and mere nurse-
lings? . This machine of
yours is nothi but an
obsolete hors de combat with
which it is not humanl
possible to work the oracle!”
At which, waxing with
indignation, he leaped upon
it, and, to my rise, did
easily propel itin whatsoever
- direction he pleased, and its
| motive power *: to be similar in every respect to the rest:
so, beguiled by his representations that, under his instructions, I
should speedily become a chef-d'oeuvre, I once more suffered myself
to mount themachine; but, whether from superabundant energy of my
foot-paddling, or the alarming fact that we were upon the descent of
a precipitous slope, I was soon horrified at finding that my instructor
was stripped out, and I abandoned to the lurch of my Caudine forkl
Oh, my goodness! My heart turns to water at the nude recollec-
tion of such an unparalleled predicament, for the now unrestrained

ºut they were all as if to burst with laughter, and none had the
ordinary heroism to intervene, and I with ever increasing rapidity
was borne helplessly down the declivity towards the gates of Hyde
Park Corner, when, by the benevolence of Providence, the anterior
wheel ran under a railing, and I flew off like a tangent into the
comparative security of a mud-barrowl

DEAREST ETHELINDA, -You owe me a
thousand fêlicitations; not on my birthday,
for that you know only blooms with the early
roses in June, but on an Event. I hasten to
chronicle it with all speed in that perfumed
violet fluid which Messrs. * * * have rendered
so necessary to all fair correspondents. . In
a word, as VICTOR. Hugo puts it, I have had
a personal interview with the Duchess of
HAGGERSTON | | | | Naturally je m'en raffole.
Are you not surprised, sweet coz, and was I
not right in claiming your compliments? It
was dear old General WHISKEE (about whom
such funny after-dinner stories are told, so
FRED FLANEUR assures me,) who arranged
the meeting. The General is au mieux with
her Grace, who, like a wise woman, does not
care for the society of the “masherkins” (the
dear Duchess's own expression) of thefrivolous
theatres. However, imagine little ME (after
an hour's journey by train, when I did not
catch cold, thankstooneof Madame ***'s new
Bdredon railway rugs) arriving in a cab at
the frowning portals of Kagmagag Castle, a
Norman structure which was taken by
WILLIAM THE ConquERoR from the Saxon
Princess ELFw YDLA, and given to the Duke's
ancestor, who filled the post of Tºre-Bouchon
de la Cour on the field of Hastings.
My arrival was evidently expected, for I
was immediately ushered through a vast
hall, filled with battle-axes, by an enormously
tall footman, who would make his fortune in
the Life-Guards, into the Duchess's boudoir.
The splendid fellow — such a gentleman—
begged me to be seated, assuring me that her
Grace would join me in a few minutes, and
having gracefully thrown some coals (the
M-rq-s of X’s “Best Screened,” I could see)
on the fire, left me with a princely bow to the
contemplation of this delicious retreat—a
niche in fairyland, with its delicate eau de nil
hangings, furniture en suite, and treasury of
Sèvres and Dresden ornaments, interspersed
with roses, camellias, orchids, palms, and tree
ferns. Note-bookin hand, Ijotted down some
of the more striking objets d'art, such as a gold
Cupid with turquoise eyes; a malachite foun-
tain discharging...extrait de réséda (* : *'s
invention); a full-length portrait in oils of
*.*.*, the famous low comedian; framed
photographs (signed) of the Crowned Heads
ºf Europe; a capacious ebony and silver box
filled with..." "schoicest cigarettes; a marble
bust of Mlle. Z * *, the witty French chan-
teuse; a collection of richly illuminated Greek
missals; a negro's 1 arranged as a candle-
stick (Ifancied I traced the skill of Messrs.
* * * in this), and a superb rug made, as I
afterwards ascertained, from the tails of

thousands of pounds. Perhaps you will smile
at these minutiae, but surely the woman in
possession had a right to take the inventory?
My pencilling (***'s shorthand) was inter-
rºby the entrance of the Duchess herself.
Ahl mamie, conceive a goddess, a Juno, with
languishing blue eyes, gold-bronze locks, and
the stature of Diana—a swelte divinity, who
would have inspired the Muse of W**, or the
brush of P " *P* * R. " ". Her Grace was
in cycling costume, which enabled me the
better to view the fascinating proportions of
her taille. I noted that her tailor-made
knickerbockers, were of thick quilted navy-
blue silk, and her shapely legs incased in a
pair of * * *'s Royal hose. On her
mouse-like Tr-lb-s were the pinked brogues

“Oh–ER—I was HERE this Morwing, You KNow.”
*ARRY ON AFRICAN AFFAIRS.
DEAR CHARLIE,-'Ow goes it, old Oyster?
Shut up in your stuffy old shell,
Out o' town, out of life, out of heverythink,
fur from the Bank and Pell-Mell,
You're a regular old Rip can Winkle, or
winkle without the Rip ran
All'ard-shell and 'orny blind hoptic. Lawks,
'ow do you stand it, old man?
In town, things skip lively, I tell you;
political pots on the bile.
“l'Oly calm”f Oh, my eye and a band-
box, the ghost of old BEAKY must smile!
True the Rads and’Ome Rulers are kiboshed,
and clean off their crumpets with spite,
But elsewere it is like good old times of ’eads
up, and “We don’t want to fight.”
With Rads it is always “tails down "l
'Owsomever they’re not in the 'unt.
Thanks to Brummagem Joe, who has floored
them, and seems coming slap to the
front. .. *
I’ve given 'im beans in the bygones, I’m
nuts on that brave Doctor JIM,
But JoE 'as 'is pints, I admit, and you
cannot knock flies off of 'im,
“Pell-Mell and the Bank,” I remarked,
CHARLIE. Ah! that’s the text for to-day;
Toffs and Tin, CHARLIE, Fashion and Funds!
They’re the only two barneys as pay.
Ask BARNEY BARNATO, ask RHoDEs, ask poor
dºkº, ask a rich lady Yank;
And they'll tell you in Mammon's own Bible
the text is Pell-Mell and the Bank.
That's wot old Sol SolomoNs tells me.
Sort of Spsherlist I. L. P. patriarch; learned
on “boom” and on “slump.” -
Like a grey JEREMIAH gone wrong, with a
ard like Niagra froze'ard,
Or a door-mat as badly wants beating. But
can't 'e spin yarns by the yard P
Rumthing, mate, your fair stony-broker who
lives up a court, on the cadge,
Bangs Rothschild in talking of millions.
I’ll wager a crown to a fadge
SoL knows more about bimetallism than
CHAPLIN or BALFouh hisself;
And SoL, says the Gods of our Period are
Privilege, Pedigree, Pelf.
The Prince and the Priest, grumbles SoL,
'ave give Plage to a new tyrant-curse,
As villainous-'ard and more vulgar, and that
is the Power o' the Purse.
Poor Sol! That’s the bee in his bonnet.
But swelp me JEMIMER, old man,
If you can’t get a slice of good old “Golden
Calf,” you must grub on cold scran.
So fur Silly Solly is right. 'Ow the doose
can a cove out a dash,
In Society—Church, State, or Sport—if 'e
an’t got the andling of cash?
It need not be 'is own—to begin with, the
shareholders' shekels will do;
But, CHARLIE, the duffingest game is 'ard
work on a measly small screw.
Spekkylation's the oyster, my pippin, from
... which you may pick the big pearl,
Life is all pitch-and-toss, when you think on
it. ot is it keeps up the whirl,
Spins the artful ones up to the surface, sucks
duffers and 'onest mugs down?
Well, it isn't 'ard work and straight ways,
I’m a thinking of going out, CHARLIE.
That’s wot set your pal on this lay.
“’ARRY's preaching,” thinks you! Well,
mate, preaching is not 'ARRY's mark—it
don't pay. - -
But two quid a week and no perks is a getting
a little mite slow; -
And Johannesburg—if there's no fighting–
would jest about suit me, I know.
Only want to see Joseph more down on that
artful old Datchman, and then
I’m an Outlander all round my 'at, CHARLIE,
either with pick or with pen,
Anythink but a rifle ! It's clear that your
Boer is a bullying brute,
Who will whine, and won't mine, the old mug;
but, by Jingo, 'e knows how to shoot.
This mixing up bizness and bullets is bosh, as
those Cornishmen thought...
If I’d been a soldier by trade, like a 'ero, no
doubt, I'd 'ave fought;
But lor! to be called from the counter ty
strap on a shot-belt and fight,
May do all very well for Dutch burghers, but
dashed if I think it seems right.
It’s a pity that brave Doctor JIM didn't wipe
those Dutch farmers clean out;
As with prºper support, and no Joe, 'e'd 'ave
done, I’ave not the least doubt.
Oh! I’m not nuts on potry, myself, and I
think “lines” is mostly tin-pºt ;
But when I read AUSTIN-well, 'ARRY must
own 'e felt 'appy and 'otl
They wos worthy of good old MAGDRRMQTT,
they wos, them there lines, and no kid.
A Briton as goes in a buster, and don't care

February 1.-Don't seem to read much

enemies. They are silenced. HomER himself
could have done no more. As for DANTE or

shamrocks and thistles will make a poor show.
Shall cover all available space with geraniums

ting from the London edition of the Johan-
nesburg Standard and Diggers' News of last
week, evidently as a valentine. At last I
shall know the result of my poem. Of course
the Boers are disheartened, hopeless, crushed.

poetically at least, England's enemies, and

UNIVERSITY INTELLIGENCE.
(A Vision of the Near Future.)
THE proceedings at j. congrega-
tion were of an unusually protracted nature,
as nearly all the lady M.A.’s now in residence
addressed the Senate at some length. Miss
BELLE, of Girton, suggested that a change
hould be made in the colour of the university
hoods. Fur, she remarked, was altogether
unsuitable and unfashionable in the summer
months, and white silk by no means suited
everyone.
freedom should be given to graduates—or,
at least, to lady-graduates–to select the
colours and materials that would harmonise
best with their dresses. It was ultimately
decided thata Syndicate shouldobtain patterns
from Messrs. LIBERTY, and report to the
Senate on the subject,

a Professorship for teaching this most useful

post would be an onerous one, and she there-
fore proposed to occupy it herself. The grace,
| however, was “non-placeted” by 345 votestol.
One of the Fellows of Girton called the
attention of the Senate to a gross neglect of
his . on the part of one of the Proctors.
An undergraduate of her college had caused
great disturbance by holding extremely rowd
‘Cocoas” in her room; and when rebuk
for her misconduct, had called the speaker
“an old cat.” She had referred the matter
to the Proctor, requesting him to fine, the
delinquent heavily; but he had taken abso-
lutely no notice of her letter. The reason of
this misplaced leniency she had just dis-
covered; the Proctor, she blushed to say, was
engaged to theyoung lady in question. (Cries
of “Shame!” and great uproar.)
The Proctor explained that, together with
all his colleagues, he wished to resign his
office. His work had been difficult enough
| before, but now that ladies had become
members of the University, it was impossible

The Senior Dean of Newnham pointed out
that all the best buildings in the University
were, quite º allotted to the men.
This anomaly must be removed. She would
allow the Trinity men to remain undisturbed
for the present. (Applause from Dr. BUTLER.)
But Newnham must have a worthier abode
than its present one. On the whole, she
thought that Clare College would suit, them

the Newnham student should ransferred

The Tutor of Clare remarked that the Dean

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
A Holiday HoRRoR
I AM about to narrate one of the most afflicting tragedies that have
*ver 90me to my knowledge, a tragedy that is in very truth a
tragedy, for it moves pity and terror º: the emotions {y them—
and that I have always understood to the genuine mark of a
tragedy. It happened during the last Christmas holidays, but a
Yery natural desire on the part of those concerned that their reputa-
tions might not suffer, kept the story from their intimates and from the
world. It was revealed to me under a pledge of profound secrecy.
As, however, no good #. can be served by keeping this pledge,
ave no scruples whatever, about breaking it. Indeed, I hayé
always been of the opinion that such E. were exacted merely
in order that they might be promptly broken. If, for instance, a
secret,is revealed to me in an ordinary commonplace way with no
special attempt to enhance m .# binding me to a complete
silence, I 5. on my . and forget about it the next minute.
But if on the other hand I am bound to silence by strange oaths, ifi
am, assured that the character of orphans, or the peace of mind of
widows depends upon my observing secrecy—why then the load
: º #. i. my .# . the *:
customed weight, an about groaning until I can obtain ease
sharing it with others. This I shall now do. y
WHEN REggR BARKworth came home for his Christmas holidays
he was received in the parental mansion in London with the usu
demonstrations of chastened joy. Reggie is at present serving his
country on board H.M.S. Britannia, §ºf for the Admiral's
mniform, with which the imagination of his fond mother has already
inv : He is a boy of high spirits, full of mischief and
F. as a boy should be, and the question of entertaining him,
* him occupied, and diverting his energies from monkey-
tricks, ºsumes a, considerable importance in an otherwise quiet
househºld. I need not go through the list of all the pantomimes,
*ainmentº, and amusements, to which Reggie was consigned in
for a spell of Reggie-duty. Sometimes, however, the stock of guar-
dians ran dry for the moment, and Reggie had to be sent off *::::
or in the company of any shipmates whom he might, have gather
round him. On an occasion of this sort, he sallied forth one
fatal day, with four others like unto himself, and visited a certain
Hall of Amusement. He had received the usual injunctions as to
the punctuality of his home-coming, and a reasonable amount of
money, strictly apportioned to his needs, had been, allotted to him.
In due time these five, budding sailors invaded the Hall. After
feasting on many marvels, listening to songs, observing dances in a
properly critical spirit, and gazing with. breathless interest, at
spangled acrobats, they found themselves in a recess dedicated to
the performances of an army of industrious fleas, in charge of a
skilled and voluble educator. The entertainment was in full swing,
but the spectators were not very numerous, and the youngsters
were therefore able to obtain front places at the table on which the
tricks were proceeding.
“THIs here,” said the educator, a melancholy man, seemingly
overweighted with his responsibilities; “this here, in the front is
Caradoc, the champion flea of the world. I ketched him young, aſ:
of a ducal establishment in the Midlands, and spent a year learnin
him all his accomplishments. He is a flea of Yery determined
character, strictly honnerble in all his dealin's; but, he has a warm
heart, and shows remarkable affection. Carado; ”—this to the flea-
“do not champ your bit so; I can't have you a pawin'...the. ſº

you to move. Ladies and gentlemen, Caradoc will now draw the
state coach four times round the arena. Then, raisin' hisself on his
hind legs, he will bow three times, salutin' the company, On the
box of the coach you will observe Charleyman, and Wellington,
two fleas specially selected for their knowledge of 'osses and power of
drivin' safe through a crowd of traffic. The flea inside the coach,
sittin' in state, is the Queen of the Sandwich Islands. She is a lazy
flea, but very stiff about etiquette; will have the other fleas a bowin
down before her, and never turnin' their backs. Now, Caradoc, you

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
here, my, young fellow”—this was to REGGIE
-“don’t you come a pushin' like that, or
you’ll upset that 'ere bottle, and there's a
matter of fiye’undred fleas in that bottle, all
in strict training, and kep' from their natural
food, so, as to make 'em, savage. ... Good
gracious ! do be careful. There, didn't I tell
you—
THE expected had taken place. REGGIE
and his companions, in their anxiety to ob-
serve the evolutions of Caradoc, Charley-
mang, .Wellington,, and the Queen of the
Sandwich Islands, had advanced too closely
to the table, and with a careless sweep of his
arm REGGIE had upset the bottle, the top of
which, I may state, was only covered with a
gard. Five hundred hungry, savage fleas, all
in strict training, saw their chance of liberty,
and most of them F. by it. Never has
there been such a hopping, such a scattering
right andleftofagonized spectators. “There,”
said the educator, as he surveyed the ruin of
his hopes, “you’ve done it this time, my boy.
Them five 'undred fleas are half-eddicated.
Many’s the day I spent over them, but it’s
all wasted now, and I’m in the Bankruptcy
Court. y, I refused a thousand pound
for that there bottle of fleas only last week.”
By this time the bottle had been restored
to its upright position and securely covered,
but it held only a very small proportion of its
original contents. Therest had vanished like
a beautiful dream, REGGIE, a boy of a kindly
disposition, was overwhelmed with grief at
the result of his thoughtlessness. “Look
here,” he said, “I’ve only got a shilling, but
if that’s any use to you you shall have it.”
“A shillin’,” said the educator in a tone of
scorn, “what’s a shillin’? But there, I’ll
take it on account, and you can pay me the
other nine-'undred-and-ninety-nine pounds,
nineteen shillin's by instalments. I dessay I
can ketch some more as time goes on. If I
do, I’ll credit you with them.” The bargain
was struck, and REGGIE went home.
OF course the matter did not end here. On
the following day REGGIE returned to the
Britannia swollen to twice his natural size.
The room he had occupied at home was fumi-
gated, but to no avail. It was occupied last
week by a beautiful *H: lady who had
come to stay for a dance... Her shrieks during
the *:::: were heartrending, and her appear-
ance the next day so painful that she had to
be wrapped in cotton-wool and sent back in
the charge of a nurse to the country vicarage
which is her home. From the Britannia
come rumours of a restless spirit on the part
of the cadets which is causing serious anxiety
to the authorities. London is at this moment
unconsciously under the domination of several
hundreds of fleas, just sufficiently educated
to know their own terrible powers, but not to
restrain them within the limits of propriety
and good-feeling. I can see only one remedy,
that the County Council should issue a
muzzling order for fleas.

WHEN REGGIE BARKwokTH came home for his Christmas holidays
he was received in the parental mansion in London with the usual
demonstrations of chastened joy. Reggir is at present serving his
country on board.H.M.S. Britannia, qualifying for the Admiral's
uniform, with which the imagination º his fond mother has already
invested him. He is a boy of high spirits, full of mischief and
ranks as a boy should be, and the question of entertaining him,
** him occupied, and diverting his energies from monkey-
tricks, ºsumes a, considerable importance in an otherwise quiet
household. I need not go through the list of all the pantomimes,
*ainments, and amusements, to which Reggie was consigned in
for a spell of Reggie-duty. Sometimes, however, the stock of guar-
dians ran dry for the moment, and ReggiE had to be sent off alone
or in the company of any shipmates whom he might, have gather
round him. On an occasion of this, sort, he sallied forth one
fatal day, with four others like unto himself, and visited a certain
Hall of Amusement. He had received the usual injunctions as to
the punctuality of his home-coming, and a reasonable amount of
money, strictly apportioned to his needs, had been, allotted to him.
In due time these five, budding sailors invaded the Hall. After
feasting on many marvels, listening to songs, observing dances in a
properly critical spirit, and gazing with breathless interest, at
spangled acrobats, they found themselves in a recess dedicated to
the performances of an army of industrious fleas, in charge of a
skilled and voluble educator. The entertainment was in full swing,
but the spectators were not very numerous, and the youngsters
were therefore able to obtain front places at the table on which the
tricks were proceeding.
“THIS, here,” said the educator, a melancholy man, seemingly
overweighted with his responsibilities; “this here, in the front is

THE expected had taken place. REGGIE
and his companions, in their anxiety to ob-
serve the evolutions of Caradoc, Charley-
mang, Wellington, and the Queen of the
Sandwich Islands, had advanced too closely
to the table, and with a careless sweep of his
arm Reggie had upset the bottle, the top of
which, I may state, was only covered with a
gard. Five hundred hungry, savage fleas, all
in strict training, saw their chance of liberty,
and most of them F. by it. Never has
there been such a hopping, such a scattering

By this time the bottle had been restored
to its upright position and securely covered,
but it held only a very small proportion of its
original contents. Therest had vanished like
a beautiful dream, REGGIE, a boy of a kindly
disposition, was overwhelmed with grief at
the result of his thoughtlessness. “Look
here,” he said, “I’ve only got a shilling, but
if that’s any use to you you shall have it.”
“A shillin’,” said the educator in a tone of
scorn, “what's a shillin'? But there, I'll
take it on account, and you can pay me the
other nine-undred-and-ninety-nine º
nineteen shillin's by instalments. I dessay I
can ketch some more as time goes on. If I
do, I'll credit you with them.” The bargain
was struck, and REGGIE went home.
OF course the matter did not end here. On
the following day REGGIE returned to the
Britannia swollen to twice his natural size.
The room he had occupied at home was fumi-
gated, but to no avail. It was occupied last
week by a beautiful young lady who had
come to stay for a dance... Her shrieks during

be wrapped in cotton-wool and sent back in

cºme rumours of a restless spirit on the part
of the cadets which is causing serious anxiety
to the authorities. London is at this moment
unconsciously under the domination of several
hundreds of fleas, just sufficiently educated
to know their own terrible powers, but not to
restrain them within the limits of propriety
and good-feeling. I can see only one remedy,
that the County Council should issue a
muzzling order for fleas.

here, my young fellow”—this was to REGGIE
-“don’t you come a pushin' like that, or
you’ll upset that 'ere bottle, and there’s a
matter of five 'undred fleas in that bottle, all
in strict training, and kep' from their natural
food; so, as to make 'em, savage. ... Good
gracious ! do be careful. There, didn't I tell
you—
THE expected had taken place. REGGIE
and his companions, in their anxiety to ob-
serve the evolutions of Caradoc, Charley-
mang, .Wellington,, and the Queen of the
Sandwich Islands, had advanced too closely
to the table, and with a careless sweep of his
arm Reggie had upset the bottle, the top of
which, I may state, was only covered with a
gard. Five hundred hungry, savage fleas, all
in strict training, saw their chance of liberty,
and most of them F. by it. Never has
there been such a hopping, such a scattering
right and leftofagonized spectators. “There,”
said the educator, as he surveyed the ruin of
his hopes, “you’ve done it this time, my boy.
Them five 'undred fleas are half-eddicated.
Many’s the day I spent over them, but it’s
all wasted now, and I’m in the Bankruptcy
Court. , Why, I refused a thousand pound
for that there bottle of fleas only last week.”
By this time the bottle had been restored
to its upright position and securely covered,
but it held only a very small proportion of its
original contents. Therest had vanished like
a beautiful dream, REGGIE, a boy of a kindly
disposition, was overwhelmed with grief at
the result of his, thoughtlessness. “Look
here,” he said, “I’ve only got a shilling, but
if that’s any use to you you shall have it.”
“A shillin’,” said the educator in a tone of
scorn, “what's a shillin'? But there, I'll
take it on account, and you can pay me the
other nine-'undred-and-ninety-nine º
nineteen shillin's by instalments. I dessay I
can ketch some more as time goes on. If I
do, I'll credit §§ with them.” The bargain
was struck, and REGGIE went home.
OF course the matter did not end here. On
the following day REGGIE returned to the
Britannia swollen to twice his natural size.
The room he had occupied at home was fumi-
gated, but to no avail. It was occupied last
week by a beautiful young lady who had
come to stay for a dance... Her shrieks during
the night were heartrending, and her appear-
ance the next day so painful that she had to
be wrapped in cotton-wool and sent back in
the charge of a nurse to the country vicarage
which is her home. From the Britannia
come rumours of a restless spirit on the part
of the cadets which is causing serious anxiety
to the authorities. London is at this moment
unconsciously under the domination of several
hundreds of fleas, just sufficiently educated
to know their own terrible powers, but not to
restrain them within the limits of propriety
and good-feeling. I can see only one remedy,
that the County Council should issue a
muzzling order for fleas.

invested him. He is a boy of high spirits, full of mischief and
F. as a boy should be, and the question of entertaining him,
eeping him occupied, and diverting his energies from monkey-
tricks, assumes a considerable importance in an otherwise quiet

for a spell of Reggie-duty. Sometimes, however, the stock of guar-
dians ran dry for the moment, and Reggie had to be sent off alone
or in the company of any shipmates whom he might, have gather
round him. On an occasion of this, sort, he sallied forth one
fatal day, with four others like unto himself, and visited a certain
Hall of Amusement. He had received the usual injunctions as to
the punctuality of his home-coming, and a reasonable amount of
money, strictly apportioned to his needs, had been, allotted to him.
In due time these five, budding sailors invaded the Hall. After
feasting on many marvels, listening to songs, observing dances in a

[“The Turk never changes.”—Prince Lobanoff.]
Bism.ILLAH! All the Giaour race
Are mutable as mist.
They know not the set Sphinxian faxe,
Of the firm clenchéd fist.
Infidel hogs, false, faithless dogs,
From Moscow to Berlin,
They’re shifting as Serbonian bºgs.
Unsettled even in sin.
The opprobium of the so-called “Powers”
Is mu-ta-bil-i-ty;
But I’m not like the accursed Giaours;
You'll find no change in me!
Sons of burnt fathers, that is how
I get the pull of them :
I of the imperturbable brow,
And the unruffled phlegm.
Iravish, slay—it is my way—
I always did, and will;
But then as slaughterer I can stay,
I kill—and kill—and kill!
They know not their own minds a mite,
They cannot long agree;
But murder is my sole delight;
You'll find no change in me'
They grunt and groan, I sit alone,
And slaughter on—by proxy.
Of mercy they make maudlin moan,
And Christian orthodoxy.
But as they are of many minds,
And I remain of one,
I give them promises, mere blinds,
And still keep up the fun.
I still play off Prince LoBANoFF
Against Lord SALS-BU-REE
At all their shifting schemes I scoff;
They’ll find no change in me !
That Russian Prince makes England wince,
And SALISBUREE, no doubt,
Makes a wry face, as at a quince,
At Russia's cynic flout.
But Russia really knows me best,
I do not change, she does.

THE SONG OF THE SULTAN.
[“The Turk never changes.”—Prince Lobanoff.]
BISMILLAH! All the Giaour race
Are mutable as mist.
They know not the set Sphinxian faxe,
Of the firm clenchéd fist.
Infidel hogs, false, faithless dogs,
From Moscow to Berlin,
They’re shifting as Serbonian bºgs.
Unsettled even in sin.
The opprobium of the so-called “Powers”
smu-ta-bil-i-ty; -
But I’m not like the accursed Giaouis;
You'll find no change in me!
Sons of burnt fathers, that is how
I get the pull of them :
I of the imperturbable brow,
And the unruffled phlegm.
Iravish, slay—it is my way—
I always did, and will;
But then as slaughterer I can stay,
I kill—and kill—and kill!
They know not their own minds a mite,
They cannot long agree;
But murder is my sole delight;
You’ll find no change in me'
Theyfº. and groan, I sit alone,
And slaughter on—by proxy.
Of mercy they make maudlin moan,
And Christian orthodoxy.
But as they are of many minds,
And I remain of one,
I give them promises, mere blinds,
And still keep up the fun.
I still play off Prince LoBANoFF
Against Lord SALS-BU-REE
At all their shifting schemes I scoff;
They’ll find no change in me !
That Russian Prince makes England wince,
And SALISBUREE, no doubt,
Makes a wry face, as at a quince,
At Russia's cynic flout.
But Russia really knows me best,
I do not change, she does.
'Tis changeless East'gainst changeful West,
I wade in blood—they buzzl
I like that LoBANOFF; although
Were he but at my knee
I’d have his head off, at a blow ;
He’d find no change in me!

-rº it, giving all the lightheartedness and pathos to
the character of young Jedbury that it requires;
and this is equally true of Miss MAUDE MILLETT
as the heroine Dora. There are two novelties
in the piece; one a character played by Mr. G.
E. BELLAMY, who makes, a decided hit by
appearing throughout the piece without having
a single word to say . just before the fall
of the curtain, when he blurts out "Hooray!”
and then, like “the brief candle,” is “heard
no more.” The success of The Silence of Dean
Maitland is as nothing to that of Mr. Bellamy
Glibb. The other novelty is the obsequious
but honestly devoted butler, Whimper, an old
family servant, who acts as the medium of
communication between Mr. and Mrs. Jedbury
(the father and mother of the hero, well repre-
sented by Mr. BEAUCHAMP and Miss EMILY
CRoss), who have quarrelled, and who only
address one another through the butler, using
him as if he were a telephone. In this part of
**The Medi " Whimper, Mr. GILBERT FARQUELAR deserves

*P*.*. . possible, though, of course, eccentric character,
and it is redeemed from absurdity by the little touch of genuine sen-
timent which the old servant exhibits when he has to, in effect, turn
Jedbury Junior out of Jedbury Senior's house. Mr. J. L. MACKAY,
as Major Hedway, is in perfect .# with his artistic make-up.
Mr., ARTHUR PLAYFAIR tones himself down to Tom Bellaby, and
renders valuable assistance. Is it an oversight on the part of the
author that Bellaby comes in hot haste, and with the utmost
earnestness, to borrow a fiver of his friend, but forgets all about
it after the first two minutes of conversation, and goes off without
ever recurring to the subject? Miss Eva MooRE is charming as
Nelly Jedbury, and Mr. BEECHER hard as nails in the character of
Mr. Simpson, the thieving manager of Jedbury & Co.'s “Bomba
House,” whose method of fraud is so crude and simple as to affor
every ground of hope for his going through life, in a highly satisfac-
tory manner, as a º: forger and absolutely transparent swindler.
Mr. L. Power's Job is, in every
way, a clever and original per-
formance. The “ confidential
yalet,” who will ultimately grow
into a family butler of the im-
persort, is averyoldfriend infarce
and comedy, and is a character
that, if brought into a piece, has
to be very carefull treated b
the dramatist, and with sti
#.; care by the actor. DICKERs
toff the essentially stagey aspect
of such a character when he made
Mr. Lenville describe the kind of
part that Nicholas Nickleby had
to write for him. The comic con-
fidential servant, and the irascible
old father, always ready to “cut
off his heir with a shilling,” are
old friends, but possible bores.
When we see either of them on the
stage we say “connu !” But in
this play, though thestern, stony-
hearted, but subsequently relent-
ing father, belongs to the old school of irascible parents, yet the
sympathetic butler and the friendly valet are ancient friends in new
aspects, and the authoress is to be congratulated on the exponents of
these two parts. Jedbury Junior has in it plenty of the right mate-
rial for the achievement of popularity, and Mr. KRRR ought to do
well with it for some time to come.

KERR VOULEZ-VOUS CHEZ TERRY }
THE present lessee of TERRY's Theatre is fortunate in his latest
production, Jedbury Junior. Brightly written is the dialogue, well
sketched the characters, and clear the farcical plot of Jedbury Junior,
written by MADELEINE LUCETTE RYLEY. Mr. KERR is excellent in

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, February 17,-Since Mr. QALDw ELL
retired from the calico-printing businessend took to Imperial politics
he has suffered some surprises and survived many disappointments.
Never did for-
tune treat him
so so y_as
to-night. Had
rem a in ed
through , long
and varied sit-
ting prepared
to discourse
on woes and
wrongs of crof-
ters. There was
preliminary
misadventure,
since WFIR had
rushed in first
and put down
amendment to
Address. He
would move it;
but House
knew member
for Mid-Lanark
was to second
it, and would
gladly suffer
Ross and Cro-
marty since it
led up to such
delight. Along
sitting, full of inconsiderable speeches about immaterial things.
The case of the dynamite prisoners restated by JoHN REDMond ;
ATHERLEY-Jones on Venezuela; WEDDERBURN on Chitral. Each
came on in turn; talked of at length; shovelled out of the way:
midnight at hand before Crofter's Amendment was reached.
With assistance of pince-nez and tragic tones WEIR floundered
through succession of incoherent remarks. Then CALDw ELL rose;
.. to reel off speech with smoothness and rapidity of the engines
calico-printing in the paternal, establishment in far cff Milton-on-
Campsie. Before forty yards had been neatly finished there was a
hitch in the machinery. Thought at first it was a pebble from the
indignant Dee protestant against its neighbourhood being dese-
crated by a calico-printing industry...Turned out to be all due to
PRINCE ARTHUR. He had been in his place through night; had
made several speeches; kept watchful eye over varied course of
business. Now, at sight of CALDweLL with bundle of notes sugges-
#: of small bale of calico ready for the printer, he incontinently
601.
CALDwell gasped for breath; rubbed his eyes; regarded with
startled gaze the empty seat. Was it possible the Leader of the
House, having in near view prospect of discourse, from him, should
have left? No doubt about fact. Prince ARTHUR had gone, appreci-
ably reducing number of audience. The LoBD ADvocate moved into
his place, with evident intention of replying...Too much this for
human nature, howsoe'er trained in adversity. Mastering his
emotion, CALDwRLL lifted up his voice, and denounced the guiltily
absent Minister who, he added, in sorrow rather than in anger, had
“apparently deputed the task of reply to a junior member of the
Government.” House so affected that everyone glad when midnight
struck a note of sympathy, and a veil dropped over painful scene.
“And they will have it,” said SARK as we wended our
melancholy way homeward, “that the Scotch people have no sense
of humour. Is there any other of the three nations capable of the
practical joke of supplying the House of Commons with opportunity
of hearing in succession JAMEs GALLowAY WEIR and JEMMY CALD-
well? The humour, I admit, is subtle. Prolongation of its flash-
ing is prone to depression. But there it is; superb in its way, quite
unique. All that is required for perfect success is capacity of appre-
ciation on the part of the audience.”
Business done.—Still talking round the Address.
By SPECIAL LICENce.
T-by, the Dog that Can't and Won't be Muzzled.
Tuesday.-JEMMY Lowth FR, saddling and bridling his old roadster,
“Protection,” trotted up and down the yard just now. JEMMY rides
well; has as good a seat on horseback as he had on judicial bench
when he presided in wig and gown at Jockey Club º
“Seems to me,” said JoHN Mowbray, one of the few Members of
the present House who knew JEMMY in days of (Parliamentary) sin
“a great pity J. L. cannot take his seat in the House as he appeare
on that memorable occasion. There are times when, contemplating
a look of awesºme gravity. But the wig and gown are adjuncts of
inestimable value..., JEMMY, so arrayed, seated at the corner of thi
front bench below the Gangway in full view of Irish Members, would
have distinctly salutary effect. Of course it cannot be: must make
the best of him as he is.” -
Performance of to-night not inspiriting. House already in this,
its earliest, lustiest infancy, oppressed by deadly weight of Minis-
terial majority exceeding three fifties. Irish Members subdivided
till there seems nothing, left but, TIM HEALY. Scotch Members all
gone to pieces; cannot be brought up to the scratch, even though
CALDwell and WEIR, claymore and pince-nez in hand, essay to lead
them on. Welsh Members have re-elected Osborne Morgan at
Chairman of their Parliamentary organisation. That looks blood-

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, February 17.-Since Mr. CALDw ELL
retired from the calico-printing business and took to Imperial politics
he has suffered some surprises and survived many disappointments.
Never did for-
tune treat him
so scurvily as
to-night. Had
rem a in ed
through , long
and varied sit-
ting prepared
to discourse
on woes and
wrongs of crof-
ters. There was
misadventure,
since WFIR had
rushed in first
and put down
amendment to
Address. He
would move it;
but House
knew member
for Mid-Lanark
was to second
it. and would
giadiy suffer
Ross and Cro-
marty since it
led up to such
delight. Along
sitting, full of inconsiderable speeches about immaterial things.
The case of the dynamite prisoners restated by JoHN REDwond ;
ATHERLEY-Jones on Venezuela; WEDDERBURN on Chitral. Each
came on in turn; talked of at length; shovelled out of the way:
midnight at hand before Crofter's Amendment was reached.
With assistance of pince-nez and tragic tones WEIR floundered
through succession of incoherent remarks. Then CALDw ELL rose;
.. to reel off speech with smoothness and rapidity of the engines
calico-printing in the paternal, establishment in far cf. Milton-on-
Campsie. Before forty yards had been neatly finished there was a
hitch in the machinery. Thought at first it was a pebble from the
indignant Dee protestant against its neighbourhood being dese-
crated by a calico-printing industry. Turned out to be all due to
PRINCE ARTHUR. He had been in his place through night; had
made several speeches; kept watchful eye over varied course of
business. Now, at sight of Fº: with bundle of notes sugges-
#: of small bale of calico ready for the printer, he incontinently
801.
CALDwell gasped for breath; rubbed his eyes; regarded with
startled gaze the empty seat. Was it possible the Leader of the
House, having in near view prospect of discourse from him, should
have left? No doubt about fact. Prince ARTHUR had gone, appreci-
ably reducing number of audience. The LoRD Advocate moved into
his place, with evident intention of replying. Too much this for
human nature, howsoe'er trained in adversity. Mastering, his
emotion, CALDwell lifted up his voice, and denounced the guiltily
absent Minister who, he added, in sorrow rather than in anger, had
“apparently deputed the task of reply to a junior member of the
Government.” THouse so affected that everyone glad when midnight
struck a note of sympathy, and a veil dropped over painful scene.
“And they will have it,” said SARK as we wended our
melancholy way homeward, “that the Scotch people have no sense
of humour. Is there any other of the three nations capable of the
practical joke of supplying the House of Commons with opportunity
of hearing in succession JAMEs GALLowAY WEIR and JEMMY CALD-
well? The humour, I admit, is subtle. Prolongation of its flash-
ing is prone to depression, But there it is; superb in its way, quite
unique. All that is required for perfect success is capacity of appre-
ciation on the part of the audience.”
Business done.—Still talking round the Address.
By SPECIAL LICENce.
T-by, the Dog that Can't and Won't be Muzzled.
Tuesday.—JEMMY Lowth FR, saddling and bridling his old roadster,
“Protection,” trotted up and down the yard just now. JEMMY rides
well; has as good a seat on horseback as he had on judicial bench
when he presided in wig and gown at Jockey Club º
“Seems to me,” said JoHN Mowbray, one of the few Members of
the present House who knew JEMMY in days of (Parliamentary) sin
“a great pity J.I. cannot take his seat in the House as he appeare
on that memorable occasion. There are times when, contemplating
preliminary co
a look of awesºme gravity. But the wig and gown are adjuncts of
inestimable value. JEMMY, so arrayed, seated at the corner of the
front bench below the Gangway infull view of Irish Members, would
have distinctly salutary effect. Of course it cannot be: must make
the best of him as he is.”
Performance of to-night not inspiriting. House already in this,
its earliest, lustiest infancy, oppressed by deadly weight of Minis:
terial majority exceeding three fifties. Irish Members subdivided
till there seems nothing left but TIM HEALY. Scotch Members all
gone to pieces; cannot be brought up to the scratch, even though
CALDwell and WEIR, claymore and pince-nez in hand, essay to lead
them on. Welsh Members have re-elected Osborne MoRGAN as
Chairman of their Parliamentary organisation. That looks blood-
thirsty. But to-night's uprising on Education Question proved
a fiasco. English Liberals chiefly anxious to arrange dinner pairs.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, February 17.-Since Mr. CALDWELL
retired from the calico-printing business and took to Imperial politics
he has suffered some surprises and survived many disappointments.
Never did for-
_- - tune treat him
- - so scurvily as
to-night. Had
rem a in ed
through long
and varied sit-
ting prepared
to discourse
on woes and
wrongs of crof-
ters. There was
preliminary
misadventure,
since WFIR had
rushed in first
and put down
amendment to
Address. He
would move it;
but House
knew member
for Mid-Lanark
was to second
it, and would
giadiy suffer
Ross and Cro-
marty since it
led up to such
- delight. A long
sitting, full of inconsiderable speeches, about immaterial things.
The case of the dynamite prisoners restated by JoHN REDwond ;
ATHERLEY-Jones on Venezuela; WEDDERBURN on Chitral. Each
came on in turn;, talked of at length; shovelled out of the way:
mº at hand before Crofter's Amendment was reached.
With assistance of pince-nez and tragic tones WEIR floundered
through succession of incoherent remarks. Then CALDw ELL rose;
an to reel off speech with smoothness and rapidity of the engines
ico-printing in the paternal, establishment in far cf. Milton-on-
Campsie. Before forty yards had been neatly finished there was a
hitch in the machinery. Thought at first it was a pebble from the
indignant Dee protestant against its neighbourhood being dese-
crated by a calico-printing industry...Turned out to be all due to
PRINCE ARTHUR. He had been in his place through night; had
made several speeches; kept watchful eye over varied course of
business. Now, at sight of CALDwell, with bundle of notes sugges-
#: of small bale of calico ready for the printer, he incontinently
601.
CALDwell gasped for breath; rubbed his eyes; regarded with
startled gaze the empty seat. Was it ible the Leader of the
House, having in near view prospect of discourse from him, should
have left? No doubt about fact. Prince ARTHUR had gone, appreci-
ably reducing number of audience. The LoRD Advocate moved into
his place, with evident intention of replying...Too much this for
human nature, howsoe'er trained in adversity. Mastering his
emotion, CALDwell lifted up his voice, and denounced the guiltily
absent Minister who, he added, in sorrow rather than in anger, had
“apparently deputed the task of reply to a junior member of the
Government.” THouse so affected that everyone glad when midnight
struck a note of sympathy, and a veil dropped over painful scene.
“And they will have it,” said SARK as we wended our
melancholy way homeward, “that the Scotch people have no sense
of humour. Is there any other of the three nations capable of the
practical joke of supplying the House of Commons with opportunity
of hearing in succession JAMEs GALLowAY WEIR and JEMMY CALD-
well? The humour, I admit, is subtle. Prolongation of its flash-
ing is prone to depression. But there it is; superb in its way, quite
unique. All that is required for perfect success is capacity of appre-
ciation on the part of the audience.”

when he presided in wig and gown at Jockey Club inquiry:
“Seems to me,” said JoHN Mowbray, one of the few Members of
the present House who knew JEMMY in days of (Parliamentary) sin
“a great pity J. L. cannot take his seat in the House as he ap
on that memorable occasion. There are times when, contemplating
a look of awesºme gravity. But the wig and gown are adjuncts of
inestimable value. JEMMY, so arrayed, seated at the corner of the
front bench below the Gangway infull view of Irish Members, would
have distinctly salutary effect. Of course it cannot be: must make
the best of him as he is.”

quiries from JokIM as to terms of board and lodgings for an old
salt who has lost an arm and found a voice in the service of his
country.
“Quite a hypothetical case, you, know,” he said to JokIM
fastening a hook in his buttonhole (“As if it were a newly-developed
orchid,” JokIM said, when telling the story). “But suppose
there was a case of a man who had sailed on many seas, in-
cluding Norfolk Broads; had ed more ships than lie at this
moment in the Pool of London; had attempted to teach MUNDELLA
navigation when he was President of the Board of Trade; had seen
himself passed over when allowance of Ministerial grog was served
round; and when approaching middle age found himself stranded in
shoal water in a dull House of Commons-suppose, I say, there was
such a case, would he be put up comfortably, of course at country's
expense, at Greenwich, there to spend his last watch meditating on
party ingratitude?”
In such circumstances, at ten o'clock at night, when dolorous
Debate on Address flickering out, JEMMY took his melancholy trot.
Wasn't allowed even to put up hurdle in form of amendment.
Managed to give one kick out at the MARKiss, who, amongst other
things, has been saying that in France, where Protection reigns in

unfounded statement never made by mortal man,” exclaimed JEMMY.

TITTLEBAT TOMKINS.
IF. Mr. Buchanan and Miss JAY had produced their play of The
Shopwalker about forty years ago, with Robson in it, and h
entitled it Tittlebat Titmouse, adding that it was adapted from
WARREN's Ten Thousand a Year, it might have achieved success,
had it not been anticipated by PEAKE's drama of Ten Thousand a
Year, which was, pro-
duced at the Adelphi in
1842, with WRIGHT as
the comic hero and PAUL
BEDFord as Huckaback,

his accession to fortune.

It has a long scene, or two that could be cut down with advantage;

body in the cast.
For example, no one could be better than Mr. Sypx|EY BRoggh as
the virtuous and rather 'aughty young lover, with little to do, and
not much of any value to say; and who, other than Mr. WARDEN, could
better represent the not absolutely colourless, because bilious-looking,

Liverpool was “found practically empty,” were unsuccessful in
obtaining damages against the shipowners. For there...was no
“satisfactory explanation or evidence” forthcoming as to the cause
of the mysterious disappearance of the “old tawny.” Either some
“sucking Nelson” on the “port watch” was at the cask during the

caused a feeling of uneasiness that could
not be overcome. The CHANCELLOR shook
his head. So did the PREMIER. Then the
MINISTER FoR FoEEIGN AFFAIRs confided
his apprehension to the MINISTER OF THE

the professors to study philosophy. The
entire population gave up their beer,
Then the doctors woke up." There would
be certainly work for them if the strain
continued. The public were unaccustomed
to the situation.
It was then the correspondent of a
foreign newspaper thought it time to ask
for further and better particulars.
He soon found a crowd surrounding the
study of the Inscrutable One. They were
listening eagerly, and keenly on the watch.
“What is it all about?” asked the re-

Then came the reply which explained

that is a matter of detail.
Now, it has occurred to me that many

result is that your admirable paper has no

that the cause of this failure in circulation
is, attributable to the fact that it is, nºt
allowed to cross the frontier. ...Very likely
you are right, so I beg you to “regularise”
the situation. This could be easily done.
All I would ask is that you should vacate
your chair, and allow me to take your
place. Then I should be able to do some-
thing for you. It would be simplicity
itself, especially on your side. You see
from this suggestion that I am a bit of a

OUR winter season at Little Puddleton (per-
fect southern climate) is in full swing. 8
Jon Eses are down from Balham, the SMITHS
from Tooting, the other SMITHs from Bays-
water, and the RoPINsons from Walham
Green. The SMITHs know the other SMITHs,
and the Jonesks, too: in fact, young SMITH
is said to be rather gone on the eldest, Jones
irl, and the, two have been noticed more
than once in the moonlight (lovely moonlight
nights here, not a bit cold), whispering sweet
no on the pier. e Jon ESEs are a
numerous family, *iºn fresh visitors arrive
at Little Puddleton, the first thing they do
is to try to count them. Estimates vary
and old friends have been known to
over their results, but on º:
—it is a perfect marvel how all those chil
can be packed away at night into those poky
little lodgings.
Ma Jones is a large, worried-looking lady,
who is always forgetting something. Gener-
ally it is the dinner. On these occasions there
is a rush to the confectioner's, and the family
dine immoderately on puffs an Fº After
that come the bilious attacks, and ADA, the
eldest, spends the night administering pills.
Pa Jones, for the most part, takes matters
quietly. At times, however, and without any
apparent cause, he bursts into a * of
excitement; and ever and anon, when you
least expect it, his agonised voice is heard—
“GeoRGEl GroRg8! I Do not climb on that
bathing-machine, Sir! .I’ve seen so many
bad accidents happen l—HARRY I HARRY |
ee

To–Ah -sºº You About An OverDRAFT,”

Johnny. “AH!—How Much HAve You got?”
just the way people get drowned, you block-
head!”
§ SMITH, ADA's young man, is a very
beautiful creature. He wears a blue serge
suit with brass buttons, a yachting hat, and
a telescope...,0n very calm days he sometimes
takes a shilling sail in The Sunbeam : on
other occasions the paces the pier, or looks
through his glass at a herring-boat and asks
the coastguard what he makes of her. If no
sail be in sight he turns his telescope, upon
the Parade and criticises the girls. “Taut
little craft, that by Jovel beating up for the
shelter, but don't much like the look of the
hulk lumbering in her wake. Phew! saucy
little barque scudding down there! Half a
mind to run alongside and board her. And
that’s her consort, flying the blue blouse!
A regular clipper, bejovel ”
ADA thinks him not only very beautiful but
astoundingly clever. She admires him im-
mensely; not, however, somuch as headmires
himself. He has proved a perfect gold mine
to the beach photographer: he has been taken
over and over again: sighting a sail through
the telescope; with the telescope under his
arm; with the telescope extended; with the
telescope shut up; with the telescope stand-
ing in theforeground; with the telescopelying
at his side—in short, with the telescope in
every pose into which the beach photographer
could persuade it.
And once, to ADA's great º *
SMITH invited her to be taken with him. It
was quite an event on the beach, and all
Little Puddleton crowded round to see. They
made a charming group; the photographer
well as he? ADA is standing with her back
against The Sunbeam; young SMITHis bend-
ing over and explaining the uses of the tele-
scope which §. out for her inspection.
ADA's head is thrown back as she looks at
her lover: her lips are parted in a happy
smile, and she listens to the words of wisdom
with wonder and interest. Altogether abeau-
tiful picture, “He looks, so noble!” thinks
ADA; and the photographer hands it round
amongst the spectators as a triumph of his
art. “It oughter 'ave a frime, Mister,”
says he. “A pink piper mount don't do it
no justice, yer see.” “Aframe let it have,”
replies young SMITH, with a lordly wave of
the hand. The crowd º: “Ah!”
cried the photographer, “them's the sort for
me! Gimme a free 'and like that and I'll
show.yer what Hartkin do!” -
It is very beautiful. ADA agrees with the
photographer, and even yºung SMITH, admit;
that it is not half bad, by Jovel, “You'd
better keep it,” he adds, in an off-hand wº
as if it were a mere *; “May. I?’
says ADA, blushing with delight, "May I
really have it?” ADA is radiant all that day;
she cherishes the tin-type in her bosom, an
Ifancy you would be pretty safe in making
a bet that when she retirestorest at night she
dreams with it under her pillow.

BY THE BEACH.

OUR winter season at Little Puddleton (per-
fect southern climate) is in full swing. e
Jon Eses are down from Balham, the SMITHS
from Tooting, the other SMITHs from Bays-
water, and the RoPINsons from Walham
Green. The SMITHs know the other SMITHS,
and the Jonesºs, too: in fact, young SMITH
is said to be rather gone on the eldest, Jones
irl, and the, two have been noticed more
than once in the moonlight (lovely moonlight
nights here, not a bit cold), whispering sweet
no on the pier. The joirses are a
numerous family. en fresh visitors arrive
at Little Puddleton, the first thing they do
is to try to count them. Estimates vary
and old friends have been known to qu
over their results, but on one point ee
—it is a perfect marvel how all those children
can be packed away at night into those poky
little lodgings.
Ma Jones is a large, worried-looking lady,
who is always forgetting something. Gener-
ally it is the dinner. On these occasions there
is a rush to the confectioner's, and the family
dine immoderately on puffs and pastry. After
that come the bilious attacks, and ADA, the
eldest, spends the night administering pills.
Pa Jones, for the most part, takes matters
quietly. At times, however, and without any
apparent cause, he bursts into a spasm of
excitement; and ever and anon, when you
least expect it, his agonised voice is heard-
“GeoRGE! GEORGE! Do not climb on that
bathing-machine, Sir! I've seen so many
bad accidents happen l—HARRY 1. HARRYl
º
Johnny (who has to face a bad Monday, to Manager at Messrs, R-thsch-lds). "AH! I-WANT
To–AH 1-skE You ABOUT AN OvskDRAFT,”
Manager. “How MUCH Do You REQUIRE f"
Johnny. “AH !—How Much HAVE You Got?"
just the way people get drowned, you block-
head!”
Young SMITH, ADA's young man, is a very
beautiful creature. He wears a blue serge
suit with brass buttons, a yachting hat, and
a telescope. On ver days he sometimes
takes a shilling in The Sunbeam : on
other occasions the paces the pier, or looks
through his glass at a herring-boat and asks
the d what he makes of her. If no
sail be in sight he turns his telescope, upon
the Parade and criticises the girls. Taut
little craft, that by Jovel bea up for the
shelter, but don't much like the look of the
hulk lumbering in her wake. Phew! saucy
little barque scudding down there! Half a
mind to run alongside and board her. And
that’s her consort, flying the blue blouse !
A regular clipper, bejovel ”
ADA thinks him not only very beautiful but
astoundingly clever. She admires him im-
#. ; not, however, so much as he admires
himself. He has proved a perfect gold mine
to the beach photographer: he has been taken
over and over again: sighting a sail through
the telescope; with the telescope under his
arm; with the telescope extended; with the
telescope shut up; with the telescope stand-
ing in the foreground; with the telescopelying
at his side—in short, with the telescope in
every pose into which the beach photographer
could persuade it.
And once, to ADA's great º *

made a charming group; the photographer
well as he? ADA is standing with her back
against The Sunbeam; young SMITHis bend-
ing over and explaining the uses of the tele-
scope which jº. out for her º:
ADA’s head is thrown back as she looks at
her lover: her lips are parted in a happy
smile, and she listens to the words of wisdom
with wonder and interest. Altogether abeau-
tiful picture. “He looks, so noble!”, thinks
ADA; and the photographer hands it round
amongst the tators as a triumph of his
art. “It oughter 'ave a frime, Mister,”
says he. “A pink piper mount ãon't do it
no justice, yer see.” “A frame let it have,”
replies young SMITH, with a lordly wave of
the hand. The crowd applaud. “Ah!”
cried the photographer, “them's the sort for
me! Gimme a free 'and like that and I'll
show.yer what Hart kin do!” -
It is very beautiful. ADA agrees with the
photographer, and even yºung SMITH admits
that it is not half bad, by Jovel, “You’d
better keep it,” he adds, in an off-hand wº
as if it were a mere *; “May I?’
says ADA, blushing with delight, "May I

she cherishes the tin-type in her bosom, an

WHAT OUR POET (THE NEWLY-MARRIED ONE) HAS TO PUT UP WITH.
“I've Just RECEIVED The Proofs or My Collects D PoEMs, DEAREst. Sir Down IN THE ARMCHAIR, AND MAKE You Rsrif
ThoRoughly comfortABLE, AND I'LL READ THRM To You,”
“OH ! THAT WILL BE DELIGHTFUL, DARLING ! only, Pou sir IN THE ARMCHAIR, AND I'LL SIT on THIS LITTLE WooDEN S100L
without A'BACK To IT-LEST I should sudden LY FEEL sleepy, You know.”
ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
OLD SERVANTs.
If I ever start a hobby—and a hobby-less old age would seem to
offer a melancholy prospect—I think I shall set up as a collector of
old servants... Old servants-the genuine variety, I mean—are rare,
and rarity is in the collector's eyes the highest recommendation. In
the feverish hurry of modern existence there is apparently no room
for the servant who is not merely old in years, but old also in regard
to the period of service during which he has been attached to one
family. Here and there, for the most part in quiet country places,
specimens are still to be found. They are easily recognisable. The
skilled collector cannot be deceived as to a Chippendale table, a piece
of old Leeds pottery, or a Stradiyarius violin. Similarly, I shall la
my hands, unerringly on the old servant wherever I find him, an
shall employ all the diabolical cunning and persistency of enthusiasts
in the effort to gain possession of my specimen and add him (or her)
to my album or my gallery.
I AM cocasionally privileged to hear from a lady of my acquaint-
ance about her maid, a real old servant if ever there was one. Far
back in the mists of a remote antiquity are concealed the beginnings
of her service. Originally, I. incline to believe, she was a nurse-
maid. She then passed into the housemaid's department, continued
as a parlour-maid, and then married. After a short spell of married
happiness her husband died, and she returned to her ancient
service, under the name of Mrs. WATson, in the capacity of lady's
maid. Ten years passed and she married again, her second husband
being a Pole named Bobbinsky. He, too, went the way of all Poles,
and she returned again—this time, as it appears, for good and all-
and now remains in unquestioned authority in the establishment of
her old mistress. For some reason the second marriage is ignored;
and although she has every right to be called Mrs. Boºnsky, she
H. * addressed as anything but Mrs. WATson, or Watson for
snort-
“Watson,” writes my friend, “is a great stand-by and helpia
the house, and is sewing and cutting out and planning to her heart's
ontent; I wish you could have heard her remarks this morning
-
-
and remember some of them for you. Time: 8,30A.M. Scene, my bed-
room. “I am in bed, taking breakfast. WATson is seated at the
bottom of the bed taking hers. We have it together, so that she can
wield the tea-pot and help generally; and you will quite understand
that, in order to show a proper respect, she takes hers on the most
uncomfortable seat and in the most uncomfortable way ingenuity can
devise. I happened to be reading something out of the morning
paper about a funeral.
‘Lor! I wouldn't 'ave married a under-
taker for all you could a' given me. , No, not if 'is 'air was 'ung
with, di'monds, I wouldn't... I've 'ad enough of 'em ; first when
the little un went, and the silly bit of poetry printed on the memorial
card, pore little dear, about setting on is father's knee no more, and
'im over seven and never 'ad set on 'is father's knee since 'e was
three.” “But who wrote the verses, WATson P’ Iventured to remark.
WATson: “Why, of course, the undertaker, 'e 'ad'em done by some
cheap poet. There’s lots of 'em always ready for a ob and they was
all the same for all the children in our district, so stupid, but
BoBRINSKY bein’ a foreigner and knowin' no better, 'e rather liked
them, and 'im and me 'ad a few words over it. But no more of
them verses for me, said I, and when BoBRINSKY went, I told 'em,
just a Plain—as plain as could be l’
“WATson, interrupting;
“‘THEY said they should advise feathers as more respectful, and
would only rise it up to thirty shillings more, but I told'em I wouldn't
'ave a feather, not one, as I knoo BoBRINSKY would late them plooms
a noddin' over 'is'ead. A plain urse and one, said I, is all I want.
But all the same it came in eleven pound six, and my brother, 'e got
ELLEN, 'is wife done for six pound ten. That shows you’ow they'll
take a single woman in. I’ad nobody to 'elp me about it all, but my
brother'e made a bargain about ELLEN, and got 'er done at trade
price, bein’ in trade 'isself, you see, penny ices and periodicals, but
still pays 'is way. She was a great trouble to my brother, was
ELLEN, and a good job too when she went, which of course she was
paralyzed in 'er chair and used to gibber at 'im when 'e asked 'er a
question. But them undertakers, lor', I 'ave a 'orror of 'em-a
swindling lotl’” If any more examples of Mrs. WATson's wisdom
should happen to come in my way I will not fail to make them
known to my readers, and on the general subject of old servants






about Bobbinsky's funeral, and undertakers in general. I must try
there may be much more to be said on another cccasion.

Qnce wethought the birdo'freedom—that’s the eagle swift of flight-
With his talons and his beak against the lion wished to fight;
But 'twas found to be another fowl, yolept the Jingo Kite,
Or the “cuckoo.”
If a ruler is as restless as the blatant Kaiser BILL,
With his telegrams and twaddle, with his painting-brush and quill,
Wiser folks can only smile and say, “Poor Polly, can't keep still.
Silly cuckoo!”
Now, behold, the bard official twangs his lute both loud and long,
But the instrument is crack'd, or else the strings have gone all wrong:
For ’tis positive that ev'ryone would º: : the song

It is Not to brave the burglar, but to get a glass of ale
From the cook-oo.
In the Arctic Expedition NANSEN bold, with trusty band,
By discovering the Pole has glory shed upon his land;
And the voice he heard the very first—“from telegrams to hand”—
Was the cuckoo!
THE ComplexT ANGoT-LER.—Two sheriffs, who raided St. John's
Market, the Liverpudlian Billingsgate, in order to effect a “distress”
upon a certain fish-wife, had a very warm reception at the hands of
the marchande de marée. The debtor, or rather debtoress, seems to
have been what the Liverpool Courier, with breezy originality, calls
“the pet of the market, like Charité, the Offenbachian heroine in
La fille de Madame Angot!” (We always had a vague idea that
this opera was from Lecocq's pen, and that Clairette was heroine
thereof.) Anyway, the lady in question was “ably supported,” her
fellow-tradeswomen rising up in arms for her against the invading
sheriffs who—“telle était i. mere Angot”—would have met with an
untimely fate had it not been for the arrival of a posse of police to
the rescue. A Hibernian spectator of the fray is said to have
remarked, “Avick I shure an’ it reminds me of an eviction l’”

Prize.—The Poet Laure- Prize.—ADAM SMITH's Prize.—YouNg's

DEAR DARLINGs, The above are the portraits of your little friends
who have been clever enough to carry off the prizes in the three
classes devoted to English Composition. I give their essays below so
that you may see for yourselves that CoRA, DoRA, and BuNIING
have fairly won the diplomas which accompany the valuable books.
The judges were the Dowager Countess of SNUFFINgton, Lady
THEoPHRASTA CHARLEMAGNE-TUBBs, and the Hon. Mrs. CAMELSUMF,
Ask Papa, Mamma, or governess to show you these ladies' names in
Burke's or Walford's Peerage; either work you will learn to love
and appreciate when you are older. I have not been out lately on
account of a severe cold, so you cannot expect much news, but this
imust interest you. My beautiful Kamtchatka pussy, Buz-Wuz,
has made me a present of five lovely wee-wee kittens. I am going
to sell them to my friends for the small sum of £2 a-piece in order
that I may help a poor lady, who does not wish her name to be
known. So if any of your relatives would like them they should
write at once, for I want the §. lady to go to the South of France
as soon as possible. Charity begins at home, but often ends abroad.
My doctor says that I ought to seek the bright sun and fair flowers
of the Riviera, so, perhaps I, too, may have to tear myself away from
dear, dismal England. But I shall be back, if { do make the
journey, in time to arrange your Easter Fancy-dress Dance, invitation
cards for which can now be had, price half-a-guinea each. As the
number of guests must be limited, it would be as well to apply at
once for the cards. The refreshments will include tea, coffee,
lemonade, sandwiches, cake, oranges, apples, and, perhaps, ices, and
I hope to engage the Green Bohemian Band. The Grand Duchess of
GRÜNTERSHEIM (look up this country in the map) has graciously
promised to be present. "So we must look forward to a jºy and select
meeting. Always, darlings, Your true friend,
AUNTIE CHICKABIDDY.
P.S. Here are the successful essays:—
CLASS I.
Subject: The Rise and Fall of Napoleon the Great.
DEAR AUNTIE,-NAPOLEoN was a bad man, but he crossed the
Alps by the use of vinegar. He fought everybody, including the
King of ENGLAND and the Emperor of Russia. It was on his famous
retreat from St. Petersburg that he skated over the Danube on the
ice. Afterwards he lost the battle of Sedan, and died in the Isle of
Elba, of a broken heart. He invented boots like his rivals, the Duke
of WELLINGTON and Colonel BLUchER. I hope this will win the
prize. Yours, most affectionately, CobA.
CLAss II.
Subject: Vegetarianism.
DEAREST AUNTIE,--The cow is a vegetarian, and so was NEBU-
CHADNFzzAR (I didn't spell this word myself), and so are my rabbits
and CHARLEY's guinea pigs. So is grandma, who likes sparrow-

A PROBLEM,
WHY is a traveller by the L. C. and D. Railway, who cannot
afford first-class fare, and who refuses to travel third, likely to do
the journey from Victoria to Ramsgate by the Granville Express in
less than a seven thousandth part of the two hours usually occupied?

House of Commons, Monday, February 24,-A pleased smile
illumined PRINCE A8th UR's countenance to-night when Private
HANBURY was brought up to the triangle and received three dozen.
Dox Josf smiled responsive. “Most useful fellow,” said PRINCE
ARTHUR; “does his work capitally in Downing Street; says nothing

PRINCE ARTHUR blandly *. a severer form of gag, not :::::::::

Thus SARK, his honest face flushed with surprise, his tender bysom
heaving with emotion. But SABK is comparatively #.". ; superla-
tively honest; a sort of Parliamentary ingénu. To older Parlia-
mentary Hands the situation is charmingly interesting. They have
seen many things on the same lines. No place in the world where
conversions are more rapid and complete than in the House of
Commons. The Right Hon. Member for Tarshish rides out one day a
Coercionist. His horse stumbles; he remounts a Home Ruler, and
gallops over everything in his new career. Or the other way about;
or the same thing on half a dozen leading questions of the day.
If the iºdividual is prominent, spiteful things are said; speeches
delivered in his earlier mood are resurrected; he is pelted with
passages, But not in modern times has the somersault, taken by a
whole Treasury Bench and the bulk of a great Party, been so
sudden, or done within the bounds of so narrow a stretch of carpet.

DEAR DARLINGs, The above are the portraits of your little friends
who have been clever enough to carry off the prizes in the three
classes devoted to English Composition. I give their essays below so
that you may see for yourselves that CoRA, DoRA, and BUNIING
have fairly won the diplomas which accompany the valuable books.
The judges were the Dowager Countess of SNUFFINgton, Lady
THEoPHRASTA CHARLEMAGNE-TUBBs, and the Hon. Mrs. CAMELsump.
Ask Papa, Mamma, or governess to show you these ladies' names in
Burke's or Walford's Peerage; either work you will learn to love
and appreciate when you are older. I have not been out lately on
account of a severe cold, so you cannot expect much news, but this
must interest you. My beautiful Kamtchatka pussy, Buz-Wuz,
has made me a present of five lovely wee-wee kittens. I am going
to sell them to my friends for the small sum of £2 a-piece in order
that I may help a poor lady, who does not wish, her name to be
known. So if any of your relatives would like them they should
write at once, for I want the {. lady to go to the South of France
as soon as possible. Charity begins at home, but often ends abroad.
My doctor says that I ought to seek the bright sun and fair flowers
of the Riviera, so, perhaps I, too, may have to tear **: away from
dear, dismal England. But I shall be back, if I do make the
journey, in time to arrange your Easter Fancy-dress Dance, invitation
cards for which can now be had, price half-a-guinea each. As the
number of guests must be limited, it would be as well to apply at
once for the cards. The refreshments will include tea, coffee,
lemonade, sandwiches, cake, oranges, apples, and, perhaps, ices, and
I hope to engage the Green Bohemian Band. The Grand Duchess of
GRÜNTERSHEIM (look up this country in the map) has graciously
promised to be present. So we must look forward to a jºy and select
meeting. Always, darlings, Your true friend,
AUNTIE CHICKABIDDY.
P.S. Here are the successful essays:-
CLASS I.
Subject: The Rise and Fall of Napoleon the Great.
DEAR AUNTIE,-NAPOLEoN was a bad man, but he crossed the
Alps by the use of vinegar. He fought everybody, including the
King of ENGLAND and the Emperor of Russia. It was on his famous
retreat from St. Petersburg that he skated over the Danube on the
jce. Afterwards he lost the battle of Sedan, and died in the Isle of
Elba, of a broken heart. He invented boots like his rivals, the Duke
of WELLINGTON and Colonel BLUch ER. I hope this will win the
prize. Yours, most affectionately, CobA.
CLASS II.
Subject: Vegetarianism.
DEAREST AUNTIE,--The cow is a vegetarian, and so was NEBU-
CHADNFzzAR (I didn't spell this word myself), and so are my rabbits
and CHARLEY's guinea §: So is grandma, who likes sparrow-

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, February 24,-A pleased smile
illumined PRINCE A8th UR's countenance to-night when Private
HANBURY was brought up to the triangle and received three dozen.
Dox Josf smiled responsive. “Most useful fellow,” said PRINCE
ARTHUR; “does his work capitally in Downing Street; says nothing
with becoming grace on the Treasury, Bench; and now, when you
and I might expect to be hauled up with embarrassing reminiscences
of what we said and did when a much milder gag than ours was pro-
posed by Mr. G. in order to carry his Home-Rule Bill, HANBURY is
#j out, takes his punishment, and we escape.”
A good deal in this.
“Remembering, and it seems but yesterday, all that was said and
done in Session of 1893, in denunciation of time-closure invoked tem-
porarily in face of avowed obstruction, after prolonged endeavour to
make way under ordinary sail, it takes away one's breath to hear
PRINCE ARTHUR blandly *. a severer form of gag, not :::::::::
ble to a Bill in exceptional circumstances, but automatically choking
discussion on the Estimates, not for one Session but for all time.”
Thus SARK, his honest face flushed with surprise, his tender bosom
... emotion. But SABK is comparatively }. ; superla-
tively honest; a sort of Parliamentary ingénu. To older Parlia-
mentary Hands the situation is charmingly interesting. They have
seen many things on the same lines. No place in the world where
conversions are more rapid and complete than in the House of
Commons. The Right Hon. Member for Tarshish rides out one day a
Coercionist. His horse stumbles; he remounts a Home Ruler, and
gallops over everything in his new career. Or the other way about;
or the same thing on half a dozen leading questions of the day.
If the iºdividual is prominent, spiteful things are said;, speeches
delivered in his earlier mood are resurrected; he is pelted with
passages, But not in modern times has the somersault, taken by a
whole Treasury Bench and the bulk of a great Party, been so
sudden, or done within the bounds of so narrow a stretch of carpet.
Cap'en ToMMY Bowles, faithful, among the faithless found...will
have none of the business. No Parliamentary Benedick he. When
PRINCE ARTHUR and D9N José said they would die rather than con-
sent to the gag, they did not believe they would live to force it on to
the House of Commons. Cap'en ToMMY, with them in 1893 when
they walked the strait path, parts from them in 1896, when they go
astray. The CAP'EN is, after all, almost human, and his voice
falters, his eye is clouded with unwonted moisture as it falls on the
figure of his apostate friend, now seated on Treasury Bench.
Memories of early happy days soften, the indignant rigour of his
regard. . He remembers, how, a Parliamentary infant, he sat
on the knee of Private HANBURY, was suckled on the Estimates,
weaned upon motions for the reduction of Ministers' salaries. And
now his nurse, his mentor, just for a handful of silver, 3.
for a ribbon to stick in his coat, has joined the brigand band he
taught the ºft ToMMY to shy stones at... The only comfort
the deserted, desolate human wreck has is in the reflection that if
some of Private HANBURy’s earliest efforts had succeeded he would
now be drawing only half his Ministerial salary.

Tuesday.—When, just before midnight, after seven hours' debate
on and round the gagging resolutions, WICARY GIBBS was observed
* Over The BohDER witH MoRLEY.”
Sir W-ll-m explains the mysteries of “cess and stent.”
rising to his feet, a shudder ran through hitherto languid House.
Old Members recalled how, on afamous night in July in the Session of
1893, WicaBY's hand set a light to the smouldering fires of resent-
ment, causing them to blaze forth, with uncontrollable force, un-
eled ferocity. New Members had read all about it., Here was
(but for a minor detail) a repetition of the causes that led up to the
famous free fight which earned for Colonel SAUNDERSON favourable
mention in the despatches. The gag, more severe, and more syste-
matic than that whose operation was the signal for the historic
scuffle, was again proposed.
The minor detail, of course, is that the very men who, in the
Home-Rule Session, indignantly denounced, resolutely resisted, the
iniquitous attempt to tamper with freedom of debate, to-day occupy
the Treasury Bench. That, of course, has little bearing on the
incident of the moment. However it be with them, to a man of
WICARY's independence, Trojan and Tyrian are the same. Not for
him to affirm that that in PRINCE ARTHUR's but a choleric word
which in Mr. G. was flat blasphemy. He will do the right thing
whate'er befall. -
Members momentarily withdrawing their gaze from the prema-
turely brindled hair of the still *:::::::: of freedom of speech,
looked round for HAYEs FISHER. as he ready to play again his
patriotic part? When, on that fateful night, Logan, sauntering
past the Front Opposition bench, seated himself partly on CARson,
Q.C., and partly an the bench, HAYES FISHER, safe in entrenchment
on the bench behind, punched him on the nape of the neck. Real
merit is always modest. When called to account HAYFs FISHER,
whilst blushingly admitting his intrepid action, insisted upon
assigning the whole initiative of the row to Mr. GLADSTONE. Mr.
G. is far removed from the scene to-night, restful by the blue water
that laps the shore at Cannes. . If HAYES FISHER means business,
and, in obedience to instinct of a noble nature, insists on appor-
iºns elsewhere the meed of praise, he must pick out some one
else,
But HAYEs FISHER is not here. As for WICARY, he is nearly three
{. older, and has evidently done with war and its alarms. His
elm is now a hive for bees. They buzz reproach round the head of
PRINCE ARTHUR, inasmuch as, he “has put a very heavy strain on
faithful and loyal followers.” But it is a mild reproof, grand-
motherly compared with the fierce trumpet-tones of defiance that
rang through the same Chamber on the same provocation three years
ago. Colonel SAUNDERson having, when WIcahy rose, the
street-door key, without which, since his experience of that July
night, he never *::::: Parliamentary debate, let it drop again
in the recesses of his pocket. It will not be wanted to-night to cool
abraised cheeks, smitten in hand-to-hand fight in resistance of that
unholy, un-English institution, the gag.
Thursday.—Nothing so Fº during course of debate on our
Procedure than readiness of the new Members to come forward and
settleknotty points. Subject full of intricacies. Oldest Parliamentary
Hands # exception, of course, of the CAP'EN) occasionally floored
by it. Once to-night, just when PRINCE ARTHUR. seemed to be
entering port with his #: cargo in prime condition, shipwreck
was imminent. Something like hopeless muddle ensued; bewildered
Members clamoured feebly for adjournment, that being, apparently,
the only safe thing. Through the storm the new Members, sat
serene and confident, radiant, with joyous consciousness of that
ability which is prior to knowledge. If there is one thing in the
world they really know nothing about, it is the bearings of Parlia-
mentary procedure. Therefore they can discuss it.
DRAGE did, with effect accidentally marred by presence of SQUIRE
of MALwood. Him he turned out of Derby at General Election. Rolled
him out of borough like an empty beer-barrel. Emerging to-night
from No. 1, Cloister, Temple, E.C. (“DRAGE just the man to select a
cloister for residence,” says SARK), he thought he would tell House
more than he knew about Procedure. Just as he was beginning his
eye fell upon figure of the SQUIRE. With the fine instinct of new
Member as to what exactly suits taste of House, DRAGE, having spare
oyster shell in his pocket, thought it would be nice to shy it at the
Figure. Nothing House of Commons so thoroughly appreciates as
spectacle of new Member, of young-mannish appearance, making his
maiden speech, saying something grossly impertinent about the
Leader of the Opposition. Pleasure enhanced by knowledge of fact
that in an electoral contest of recent date the old Member had been
unseated by the new. “A monumental instance of inconsistency
throughout his political life,” was the reflection that occurred to
Mr. DRAGE as he regarded the SQUIRE.
Effect of carefully conned sentence a little disappointing. House
growled its discontent. DRAGE rised; began to wish he was
safely back in the Cloister, Ed. Thought he heard Dr. Glºr
smile. Turned upon him with cloistered severity. Rebuked him in
the name of private Members.
“I made no observation,” said Dr. CLARK, justly amazed at his
own forbearance.
“Hal” cried DRAGE, frowning; “it
is perhaps as well that the hon. Mem-
ber did not.”
“Now that at least is good,” said
the appreciative SARK. “It comes
nearer to a repartee by the Hatter than
anything heard out of Wonderland.”
Applause grew so persistent ard
promiscuous that the new Member
abruptly resumed his seat, having
omitted to say what he had risen to
ropound on the subject of New Proce-
ure Rules.
Business done. — Procedure Rules

mine exactly what we and they mean.

Had taught you how for trumps to call,
And how to score with chances few.
With eager zest the game commenced,

Nor was I angry when you placed

But then it often has been found
That theory is worse than deed.
A bumper rubber! Yet your smile
Was not less joyous than before,
“With hearts for trumps, just wait a

You cried, as we began once more.
'Twas in the middle of the game,
In dire distress, I breathed a wish
That grandmamma, of matchless fame,
Had read a little Cavendish.
'Twas quite by accident I spoke—
My stupid tongue I can't restrain!
So do blame me for your revoke

ROYALTY BICYCLING.
H.R.H. The Prince of WALEs has taken
to biºycling. After the usual spill or two,
which all first-rate riders whether on
horses or wheels must experience, His
Royal Highness is becoming such an ex-
pert that a change of title is seriously
contemplated. . If the alteration can be
made without harm to the British Consti-
tution (an excellent one enjoyed by the
enjoys), then H.R.H. will be known as
** The Prince of Wheels.”
DR. Fish ER, Suffragan Bishop of South-
ampton, is evidently exceptionally and
deservedly popular. According to the
Westminster, “he has enormous influence
with jockeys in Yorkshire” and “at
Newmarket.”, “FISHER” is an appro-
priate name for a Bishop, as “Piscator
hominum ”; and it is sº proved by his
already having caught the jockeys, and
all “on his own hook.” May he follow
in the footsteps of , the great, Bishºp
FISHER; only, may he never “lose his

cept for conscience' sake.

THE CHAUNT OF THE BODLEY HEAD.
(After Praed.)
I THINK what modern mortals crave,
With feverish endeavour,
Is work erotically brave,
Satanically clever:
I think no book should now be long,
And therefore I determine
That paradox must mark the song,
And epigram the sermon.
I think the business of the wise
Is with old rules to quarrel,
Defiant of the decencies
Óblivious of the morai ;
The rule of Art the Autocrat
No ethic impulse troubles,
While priest says this, and pedant that,
Art-blows mephitic bubbles.
I think they should be brightly blown,
Though full of poisonous vapour,
Sin's iridescent sheen alone
Qutshines dull Virtue's taper.
Old Honesty temptation flies
And bids the devil behind him ;
But we log-roll the Sire of Lies,
And Beardsleyesquely bind him.
I think to grub like ghouls in graves
For gruesome allegories,
Creative talent while it saves,
Gives vogue to vapid stories.
Old-fashioned critics carp and fume,
Neurotic nonsense banning;
But while the bookstalls give us room,
Fresh bogies pay for planning.
I think the DICKENSEs and Hoods,
Their stories and their verses,
Too cheerful far for modern moods,
Which run on crimes and curses,
I think Modernity must frown
On Nell, or We Are Seven ;
For nothing now will take the town
That smacks of home or heaven.
I think Love's like a problem-play
Where Pan and Pool.E are blended;
Or like a foul November day,
Whose fog in sludge is ended.
Good fun in coster, cad, or rough,
In slums and “ fourpenny dosses”;
But, bound in marriage bonds, stale stuff,
Which natural instinct crosses.
I think that sex, old he and she,
Want some new common measure,
That love, like union, should be free,
Its only object pleasure.
One man one wife might well content
The drudge, the saint, the friar,
Were wedlock more a sacrament
And woman less a liar.
I think that Wit should woo St. Giles,
And not St. George, or Stephen.
That Rahab and her subtle wiles
Make Fancy's truest heaven.
The pink and pure no more delight
Your genius-gifted fellow,
Now #. Art is black and white,
And Literature all yellow.
The world for geniuses has sighed
And I, in sheaves, have found them ;
I’ve printed them with margins wide,
And arabesquely bound them.
Some who once ..º. in remorse
Their idols now seem burning;
But I keep on my even course,
A lane that has no turning.

THE METROPOLITAN STATUE8 SUPPLY ASSOCIATION.
[“Mr. AKERs-Douglas, replying to Mr. LABouchERE as to whether his
attention had been called to a statue purporting to be of the late Mr. John
BRIGHT in the Central Lobby, and whether it is to remain there,” said that
it was erected under arrangements made with his predecessors. He admitted
that there were very varied views as to its artistic merits.”]
THIs company has been formed for the purpose of supplying
public statues and monuments on the hire system. In consequence
- of the numerous complaints against existing
statues, there is reason to believe that tem-
§: memorials, if obtainable, would be uni-
V y erected...The promoters expect that
the company will be immediately #.
Sole. Purveyors of Statues to the Houses of
Parliament. It is needless to draw attention
to the many advantages which would have
accrued to the pockets of the subscribers, to
the uninterrupted ess of traffic, and to
the public comfort and convenience generally
—not to mention the cause of Art—if the
majority of statues and memorials in London
had been obtained on this system, and had
been subsequently removed. The apparently
permanent erections and statues in various
recent exhibitions have shown that the use of
real bronze or marble is an old-fashioned and
exploded fallacy.
Guaranteed Portrait Department. — On
payment of ten per cent. extra on the hiring
terms, a certificate of correct resemblance, signed by the executors
of the person represented, will be supplied with the statue.
Circulating Statuary Department.-Statues lent out in the same
manner as books from Messrs. MUDIE's. For terms of subscription,
§ to the Secretary. Statues cannot be changed more frequently
an once a week.
Memorials Department. -Larger erections, containing several
statues or groups, supplied at the shortest notice. A largeselection of
horses, griffins, and other animals. The hitherto disregarded anatomy
and action of these fabulous monsters will be carefully attended to.
. Fountains Department.-The new patent fountains, with imita-
tion jets of water, will be a special feature. This new invention
obviates the wetting of passers-by, the fear of which has hitherto
prevented the use of a large jet, and has necessitated a meagresquirt
or dribble of water, of mean and ridiculcus a ance. The new
jets, of a patent metallic compound, gleam in the sunlight, and are
varied at intervals in rise and fall by an arrangement of springs in
the fountain...They are at present manufactured in Germany by the
Wissenschaftlichekunstgesellschaft, the Scientific Art Company, of
Berlin, Real water for drinking purposes, rarely required, can, if
wished, be supplied from a tap.
Secondhand Department.—A large number of returned statues,
misfits, and other slightly damaged stock, will be offered for sale at
immense reductions. Suitable for provincial towns, tea-gardens,
newly-erected villa residences, &c., &c. Warranted to stand the
weather if properly varnished once a year. Great reduction on
taking a quantitv.
Preliminary Notice of Sale.—A job lot of real bronze and marble
statues, removed from Westminster, Trafalgar Square, the, City,
&c., will shortly be ºffered at ridiculously low prices. Also an
aluminium an ſº. and a griffin. Both with very spirited
action. Suitable for exportation to Central Africa.

To dwell in a dull hole because it’s called home!
The unselfish stay-at-home girl has no chance;
She must tennis and flirt, she must bike, skate, and dance.

She must flourish around if she'd score a success.
Home? home? Abroad she must roam,
Or be doomed all her days to that dull place called home!
If married and mother she yet plays her part;
With six charming children she still must look “smart.”
For, judging by facts, what Society likes, .
Is a maid who is bold, and a matron who bikes.

THE METROPOLITAN STATUE8 SUPPLY ASSOCIATION.
[“Mr. AKERs-Douglas, replying to Mr. LABouchERE as to whether his
attention had been called to a statue “purporting to be of the late Mr. John
BRIGHT in the Central Lobby, and whether it is to remain there,” said that
it was erected under arrangements made with his predecessors. He admitted
that there were very varied views as to its artistic merits.”]
THIs company, has been formed for the purpose of supplying
public statues and monuments on the hire system. In consequence
- of the numerous complaints against existing
statues, there is reason to believe that tem-
po memorials, if obtainable, would be uni-
versally erected. The promoters expect that
the company will be immediately #.
Sole Purveyors of Statues to the Houses of
Parliament. It is needless to draw attention
to the many advantages which would have
accrued to the pockets of the subscribers, to
the uninterrupted progress of traffic, and to
the public comfort and convenience generally
—not to mention the cause of Art—if the
majority of statues and memorials in London
had been obtained on this system, and had
been subsequently removed. The apparently
permanent erections and statues in various
recent exhibitions have shown that the use of
real bronze or marble is an old-fashioned and
exploded fallacy.
Guaranteed Portrait Department. — On
payment of ten per cent. extra on the hiring
terms, a certificate of correct resemblance, signed by the executors
of the person represented, will be supplied with the statue.
Circulating Statuary Department.--Statues lent out in the same
manner as books from Messrs. MUDIE's. For terms of subscription,
apply to the Secretary. Statues cannot be changed more frequently
an once a week.
Memorials Department. -Larger erections, containing several
statues or groups, supplied at the shortest notice. ...A large selection of
horses, griffins, and other animals. The hitherto disregarded anatomy
and action of these fabulous monsters will be carefully attended to.
. Fountains Department.-The new patent fountains, with imita-
tion jets of water, will be a special feature. This new invention
obviates the wetting of passers-by, the fear of which has hitherto
prevented the use of a large jet, and has necessitated a meagre squirt
or dribble of water, of mean and ridiculcus a ance. The new
jets, of a patent metallic compound, gleam in the sunlight, and are
varied at intervals in rise and fall by an arrangement of springs in
the fountain. They are at present manufactured in Germany by the
Wissenschaftlichekunstgesellschaft, the Scientific Art Company, of
; i. water for drinking purposes, rarely required, can, if
wished,

Secondhand Department.—A large number of returned statues,
misfits, and other slightly damaged stock, will be offered for sale at
immense reductions. Suitable for provincial towns, tea-gardens,
*...*. villa residences, &c., &c. Warranted to stand the
weather if properly varnished once a year. Great reduction on
taking a quantity,
Preliminary Notice of Sale.—A job lot of real bronze and marble
statues, removed from Westminster, Trafalgar Square, the, City,
&c., will º be offered at ridiculously low prices. Also an
aluminium angel (tarnished), and a griffin. Both with very spirited
action. Suitable for exportation to Central Africa.

repaired to my seat immoderately encouraged by such gracious

My companions marvelled greatly at the severe curvature of the
extremities of the cycle-track, which were shaped like the interior of
a huge bowl, and while I was demonstrating to them how, from
scientific considerations and owing to the centrifugal forces of
gravitation, it was not possible for any rider to become a loser of his

But on being disentangled they did limp away, and it is allowable
to hope that they suffered no serious imantling of their vital
organs. Still, I cannot approve of
these bicycle contentions, which are
veritable provocative flights at the
providential features.
It is nem, con, and undeniable that
it was a wise move to transfer the race

moteness of Newmarket Downs to a
spot where it can be competed de die

for so respectable a Thespian to chase
Charley's Aunt around the circum-
ference of the velodrome, and the
spectacleof such incongruous spright-

The concluding entertainment was
a military battle with the Chitralis;
and how to express the swelling of
my heart with the martial sentiment
of courage at beholding the warriors
on the march, and taking tender
farewells of their ladyloves and
fiancées, who were Niobe all tears on
the shoulders of their nearest rela-
tions !
And pride further expanded my
bosom to witness the construction of
an impromptu bridge in a storm of
snow across the bottomless pit of an
abyss, and the gallantry with

thundered to the dismay of their barbarian adversariesl

can youch from personal experience,
After the termination I conducted my protégées to the Palmarium,
where we, sat under a shrub #.f lemon crushes, brought by a
neat-handed Phyllis in the uniform of a housemaid intermixed with
a hospital nurse. Here occurred a most discomposing contretemps,
for presently Miss Jessiyſi NA, uttered the complaint that two
strangers were regarding herself and Miss SPINK with the brazen
eyes of a sheep, and even making personal comments on my
nationality, which rendered me like %ał".under a harrow with burn-

of the Phyllises and requested her to take steps to abate the nuisance,
being met with a smiling “Nolo Episcopari.” Sø, entreating my
Qompanions not to give way to panic and leave their cause in my
hands, I went in search of a policeman.
Unfortunately some, time flew before I could find one at liberty to
understand my crucial position, nor could I obtain from him a legal
opinion as to whether I could administer a duff or a slap in the ear
to my insulters without incurring risk of retaliation in kind.

SPINK were similarly imperceptible.
However, after prolonged search and mental anxiety,
I returned alone, and was rewarded by finding my fair
friends arrived in safety; and hearing that the two
strangers had explained, in the gentlemanly terms of
an apology, that they had mistaken them for acquaint-
ances.
Consequently I am thankful that I did not execute
my design of assault and battery, more especially as I

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
MoRE ABOUT OLD SERVANTs.
I LEFT off last week º said but little on the general
character of old and faithful servants—the epithets in
this connection are practically synonymous., Feudalism
as a vital force has vanished from the land, but in the
relation of an old servant to, the family he has served
something of feudalism still lingers, something that
enables one to understand the deep devotion of mediaeval
retainers to their house and the fatherly interest of the
lord in his dependants. It is curious how, as the years
o by, the ancient butler or body-servant assimilates
the characteristics of the master he admires; imitates,
let us say, his little bursts of temper, his manner of bear-
ing himself, his walk, the fashion of his ties, and his way
of wearing his hat, and offers to a different circle a
reproduction, as close as circumstances will permit, of the
general air of his beloved master. One venerable servitor
of this kind it was my lot to know, and I shall never
forget the old man's grief and vexation when his master,
who had long worn his collars turned down, was
suddenly converted to the stick-up variety. It was as
though the face, of the world, had been completely
changed, so difficult did he find it to accommodate him-
self to his master's new appearance.
“Of course,” he observed, “Mr. B. looks well in that
kind of collar—he'd look well in anything; but there
was a something about the old ones which I can't get in
this new lot. It isn't for me to make a remark, but
there, Sir, don't you think them turn-downs gave him a
more noble look, 'aughtier as you may say, and more of
the master. I'm certain it’s not so easy to respect a

stick-up.” “Jackson,” I. retorted, “I’m willing to
stake my fortune, you’ll be in stick-ups yourself, before a month is
past.” “Me, Sir? Never!” . But in a fortnight the old fellow
was in º went about his work as if he had never
worn any other kind. He used to be very severe, I remember, with
theyounger members of the family, and used to hurl at them curious
and terrible compound oaths which he had contrived, so he said, to
manufacture during his foreign wanderings in attendance upon
his master. Sakrabilliapolakadonia, Master, FREDDY, will you
stop making that noise outside your father's libery door,” or
“Jessessamanessy, Master Dick, if I ketch you stealing another
of your father's cambric hankerchers you and me will have
to : there's no two words about that.” These are two of the
a phrases I have heard him use. The #" sters, I am sorry to
say, used to laugh at him, and take a fiendish delight in irritating
him almost beyond endurance.
THE old servant, however, is to be known not merely by his venerable
and awe-inspiring appearance. That, of course, is one mark, but it is
not invariably, found; . The most certain, indications are, first, an
absolute devotion to his master and mistress; second, a fatherly
interest in the younger members of the family; and third, a claim,
which is never contested, to be consulted in all family arrangements,
and to have his views treated with deferential respect. The devotion
does not exclude criticism, the fatherly interest often entails dis-
approval of pranks to which boys and girls all the world over are
prone. But as against the rest of the world the family is, in the eyes
of the old servant, composed of immaculate paragons, and woe beſide
the rash outsider whoventures to hint a fault in anyone of them, And
the boys and girls, though they may grow up and pass out into the
world and become in their turn fathers and mothers, are, to the old
servant, children to the end of the chapter, children who have to be
protected against themselves, and whose wayward dispositions must
loyal ingenuity can extricate them; . And how cheerfully, the old
fellow's face glows, how warm is his faithful welcome when the
captain returns from India, or the daughter of the house comes back
for a time to the parental nest with anew little fledgeling in her arms;
Old servants and dogs—these are the only classes in which you find
unquestioning faith and an attachment, rooted deep down in their
very being, which nothing can alter or destroy.
As I write there arrives a further communication relative to Mrs.
M. of whose table-talk I gave a specimen last week. Here is
another:-
“We 'ad a garden, BoBRINsky and me, size of a pocket-'anky-
chif, at Tottenham, where my brother'e used to come of a Sunday
mornin' with a pennywuth o' mixed seeds in 'is pockets, all sorts;
and after cleanin' the boots for me, which BoBRINSKY bein’ a Pole
and proud never would do, but my brother o' course 'ad been a
dragoon and learnt to be 'andy, 'e used to plarnt them seeds all
over the place, and sich a crush when they all begun a comin' up,
and no room for 'em—it was 'ere am I and where are you-but my
brother'e said when some of 'em died down the others would be a
†. up, and we should always 'ave a show that way, and 'e'd
chance it; but not knowin', the proper, seasons for plarntin' there
was a rare muddle, and the little'un'e kep' tearin' of 'em up to see
where the roots was... Still it was pretty cheery, and Bobbinsky 'e
rigged up a plank or two, with a nice piece of tarpaulin' over the top,
and read 'is noospaper there of a Sunday mornin', and said it rather
reminded 'im of Poland. BoBRINSKY, pore fºllow, 'e died soon
arter we left Tottenham of a º noomonia, which is when you’ave
it in both lungs they call it ploral. But there, single noomonia is bad
enough I say.”
UTAH has just been admitted into the American Union. It surely

always involve them in scrapes, out of which only an old servant's I will
ill be known as the Matrimonial State.

But on being disentangled they did limp away, and it is allowable
to hope that they suffered no serious ismantling of their vital
organs. Still, I cannot º of
these bicycle contentions, which are
veritable provocative flights at the
providential features.
It is nem, con, and undeniable that
it was a wise move to transfer the race
for the Derby Ribbon from the re-
moteness of Newmarket Downs to a
spot where it can be competed de die
in diem and under a cover. And I
was overjoyed to perceive Hon'ble Sir
HENRY IRWING, who was pointed out
to me, returned from United States
of New York, and driving a small
open vehicle in company of Charley's
Aunt and a youth attired as amariner.
But the pity of it, Horatio l that he
had selected a steed of such snailish
propensity as only to be budged by
the pricks of a parasol! Moreover, I
venture to hint that it was infra dig.
for so respectable a Thespian to chase
Charley's Aunt around the circum-
ference of the velodrome, and the
spectacleof such incongruous spright-
liness may detriment his fame as a
tragic.
The concluding entertainment was
a military battle with the Chitralis;
and how to express the swelling of
my heart with the martial sentiment
of courage at beholding the warriors
on the march, and taking tender
farewells of their ladyloves and
fiancées, who were Niobe all tears on
the shoulders of their nearest rela-
tions!
And pride further expanded my
bosom to witness the construction of
an impromptu bridge in a storm of
snow across the bottomless pit of an
abyss, and the gallantry with
- which British troops volleyed and
thundered to the dismay of their barbarian adversariesl
. Such exhibitions do greatly assist in promoting patriotism, and
implant the courageous impulse in many an unwarlike breast, as I
can vouch from personal experience.
After the termination I conducted my protégées to the Palmarium,
where we, sat under a shrub H.; lemon crushes, brought by a
neat-handed Phyllis in the uniform of a housemaid intermixed with
a hospital nurse. Here occurred a most discomposing contretemps,
for presently Miss JºssIMINA, uttered... the complaint that two
strangers were regarding herself and Miss SPINK with the brazen
eyes of a sheep, and even making personal comments on my
nationality, which rendered me like under a harrow with burn-
ing indignation:
At length, being utterly beside myself with rage, I summoned one
of the Phyllises and requested her to take steps to abate the nuisance,
being met with a º g “Nolo Episcopari.” Sº, entreating my
Qompanions not to give way to panic and leave their cause in my
hands, I went in search of a policeman.
Ünfortunately some time flew before I could find one at liberty to
understand my crucial position, nor could I obtain from him a legal
opinion as to whether I could inister a cuff or a slap in the ear
to my insulters without incurring risk of retaliation in kind.
And, on returning to the spot with a large, stout constable, I had

the mortification to discover that the two impolite
strangers had º: and that Misses MANKLETow and
SPINK were similarly imperceptible.
However, after prolonged search and mental anxiety,
I returned alone, and was rewarded by finding my fair
friends arrived in safety; and hearing that the two
strangers had explained, in the gentlemanly terms of
an apology, that they had mistaken them for acquaint-
ances.
Consequently I am thankful that I did not execute
my design of assault and battery, more especially as I
am the happy receiver of many handsome compliments
on all sides upon the tactfulness and savoir faire with
which I extricated myself from my shocking fix.
At which my countenance beams with the shiny

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
MoRE ABOUT OLD SERVANTs.
I LEFT off last week º said but little on the general
character of old and faithful servants—the epithets in
this connection are practically synonymous. Feudalism
as a vital force has vanished from the land, but in the
relation of an old servant to, the family he has served
something of feudalism still lingers, something that
enables one to understand the deep devotion of mediaeval
retainers to their house and the fatherly interest of the
lord in his dependants. It is curious how, as the years
go by, the ancient butler or body-servant assimilates
the characteristics of the master he admires; imitates,
let us say, his little bursts of temper, his manner of bear-
ing himself, his walk, the fashion of his ties, and his way
of wearing his hat, and offers to a different circle, a
reproduction, as close as circumstances will permit, of the
general air of his beloved master. One venerable servitor
of this kind it was my lot to know, and I shall never
forget the old man's grief and vexation when his master,
who had long worn his collars turned down, was
suddenly converted to the stick-up variety. It was as
though the face, of the world, had been completely
changed, so difficult did he find it to accommodate him-
self to his master's new appearance.
“Of course,” he observed, “Mr. B. looks well in that
kind of collar—he'd look well in anything; but there
was a something about the old ones which I can't get in
this new lot...It isn't for me to make a remark, but
there, Sir, don't you think them turn-downs gave him a
more noble look, 'aughtier as you may say, and more of
the master. I'm certain it’s not so easy to respect a

stick-up.” “Jackson,” I. retorted, “I’m willing to
stake my fortune, you’ll be in stick-ups yourself, before a month is
past.” “Me, Sir? Never!” . But in a fortnight the old fellow
was in stick-ups, and went about his work as if he had never
worn any other kind. He used to be very severe, I remember, with
the younger members of the family, and used to hurl at them curious
and terrible compound oaths which he had contrived, so he said, to
manufacture during his foreign wanderings in attendance upon
his master. Sakrabilliapolakadonia, Master, FREDDY, will you
stop making that noise outside, your father's libery door,” or
“Jessessamanessy, Master Dick, if I ketch you stealing another
of your father's cambric hankerchers you and me will have
to part; there’s no two words about that.” These are two of the
awful phrases I have heard him use. The youngsters, I am sorry to
say, used to laugh at him, and take a fiendish delight in irritating
him almost beyond endurance.
THE old servant, however, is to be known not merely by his venerable
and awe-inspiring appearance. That, of course, is one mark, but it is
not invariably, found; . The most certain, indications are, first, an
absolute devotion to his master and mistress; second, a fatherly
interest in the younger members of the family; and third, a claim,
which is never contested, to be consulted in all family arrangements,
and to have his views treated with deferential respect. The devotion
does not exclude criticism, the fatherly interest often entails dis-
approval of pranks to which boys and girls all the world over are
prone. But as against the rest of the world the family is, in the eyes
of the old servant, composed of immaculate paragons, and woe betàe
the rash outsider whoventures to hint a fault in anyone of them. And
the boys and girls, though they may grow up and pass out into the
world and become in their turn fathers and mothers, are, to the old
servant, children to the end of the chapter, children who have to be
protected against themselves, and whose wayward dispositions must
loyal ingenuity can extricate them. And how cheerfully the old
fellow's face glows, how warm is his faithful welcome when the
captain returns from India, or the daughter of the house comes back
for a time to the parental nest with anew little fledgeling in her arms;
Old servants and dogs—these are the only classes in which you find
unquestioning faith and an attachment, rooted deep down in their
very being, which nothing can alter or destroy.
As I write there arrives a further communication relative to Mrs.
M. of whose table-talk I gave a specimen last week. Here is
another:-
“We 'ad a garden, BoBRINsky and me, size of a pocket-'anky-
chif, at Tottenham, where my brother'e used to come of a Sunday
mornin' with a pennywuth o' mixed seeds in 'is pockets, all sorts;
and after cleanin' the boots for me, which BoBRINSKY bein’ a Pole
and proud never would do, but my brother o' course 'ad been a
dragoon and learnt to be 'andy, 'e used to plarnt them seeds all
over the place, and sich a crush when they all begun a comin' up,
and no room for 'em—it was 'ere am I and where are you-but my
brother'e said when some of 'em died down the others would be a
†. up, and we should always 'ave a show that way, and 'e'd
chance it; but not knowin', the proper, seasons for plarntin' there
was a rare muddle, and the little’un”e kep' tearin' of 'em up to see
where the roots was... Still it was pretty cheery, and BoBRINSKY 'e
rigged up a plank or two, with a nice piece of tarpaulin' over the top,
and read 'is noospaper there of a Sunday mornin', and said it rather
reminded 'im of Poland. BoBRINSKY, pore fºllow, 'e died soon
arter we left Tottenham of a ploral noomonia, which is when you’ave
it in both lungs they call it ploral. But there, single noomonia is bad
enough I say.”
UTAH has just been admitted into the American Union. It surely



always involve them in scrapes, out of which only an old servant's
will be known as the Matrimonial State.

THE IRON AGE.
From “The World,” June, 1900.
THE first meet of the Out-of-Hand Club last
week was a great success, no fewer than six-
teen automobile coaches assembling at the
Magazine. Lord PENNINGTON's turn-out, as
usual, was the object of general admiration;
the brass-work of his engine was in perfect
order, and he handled the lever with all his
accustomed skill. That post of honour, the
stoker's seat, was occupied by Lady WERA
PLANTAGENET. Sir THoMAs Jon Es's petro-
leum-car was also *...* notice, although
some of the critics thought that the odour of
the oil was a little excessive. Punctually at
three o'clock, to the cheery blast of the steam-
whistles, the procession started for Greenwich.
Unfortunately Mr. REDDINGTON's accumula-
tors refused to act, so that his tiectric coach
was left standing, and had ultimately to be
towed home by a traction-engine. Close to
Greenwich, too, another casualty occurred, as
Lord CoBBLE's car suddenly bolted down-hill.
We believe that a few pedestrians were killed,
but fortunately nor - harm was done.

WE regret to have to record the death,
under melancholy circumstances, of the Duke
of PUDDIETON, His Grace was extremely
anxious to take part in the Division of last
Tuesday on the Infants' Suffrage Bill. He
drove to the House of Lords in his steam-car-
riage, and, fearing that he would not arrive in
time to vote, he rashly sat upon the safety-
valve. He was said by the passers-by to have
been travelling fully at the rate of a mile a
minute when the boiler exploded. We hear
that such fragments of his Grace as were after-
wards collected are to be interred to-morrow.
- -
To those ladies of weak nerves who are un-
able to ride a bicycle, and find the ordinary
automobile machine too skittish, we may con-
fidently recommendMessrs. Dobb's new minia-
ture steam-rollers, each of which is warranted
quiettoride and drive. Several of thesedainty
engines, tastefully painted in art colours, have
lately been seen in the Park.

A complaiNT comes from the Household
Cavalry that it is extremely difficult to ride
their new bicycle-chargers in the regulation
top-boots... Hitherto their protests have met
with no attention at the hands of the War
Office, and we suppose that the usual red-
tape difficulties be urged against any
change. Yet the War Office can be radical
enough on occasion. It is actually proposed
to repaintin a darker colour the famous white
machines of the Scots Greys, on the plea that
the present hue would be too conspicuous on
the battle-field I

WE omitted to mention at the time the last
meet of the Pytchley, which took place some
weeks ago. The scent was exceedingly well
laid, the paper being sufficiently thick to pre-
vent any check all through therun. Amongst
the first to reach home was that well-known
rider Miss BUSTER, who was mounted on a
“Scorcher” racer, which carried her admi-

AN IMPERIAL INTERVIEW.
Brussels, March 4, 1896.
SIR,-Armed with your credentials, I had no difficulty in obtaining
an interview with the August Personage, whose name it is as well not
to mention in view of the perturbed state of Europe. I found him at
his Imperial Castle of Pansmutter (it is best to be discreet), busil
engaged, with a large º of the world before him, in planning, as
imagined, some delightful foreign trips. As I ...tº his study he
was singing, to a not unfamiliar air, the following words:-
“Rule, rule the KAIsPR,
He rules the earth and waves
And Teutons ever, ever must be slaves.”
“Words and music mine own,” he said, with some touch of pride,
as he begged me, as he expressed it, “to come to an anchor.” I was
struck by the August One's attire. On his head he wore an eagled
helmet; his coat was, if I mistake not, the full-dress swallow-tail of
a British admiral, and his legs displayed the tight red continuations
of a hussar, together with a pair of long sea-boots. The August One
evidently noticed my surprise at his original costume, for he observed
º, “I am the impersonification of the Army and the Navy.com-
ed. I am, as it were, Mars-Neptune, formidable, awe-striki
not to be contradicted. You see,” he added, pointing to the map; * f
am, as is my custom, amusing myself with a little game of Inter-
national Harum-Scarum—my own invention and sufficiently enter-
taining.” I begged the August One to explain. He graciously
acceded to my request.
“Here, for instance, is Constantinople. A lot of Powers are
knocking at the Porte-joke of my own, registered for *:: comic
opera. I encourage them to go on knocking, but I also him who
has the key to be sure and not open the door. One of the Powers
knocks louder than the others; instantly, in the twinkle cf an eye
(augenblick), I suggest to a good friend across the Atlantic that this
noisy Power is about to poach on his territorial preserves. The good
friend takes the bait and threatens the noisy Power, who instantly
suspends his knocking, and, before he can begin again, I myself put
me as chestnut-out-of-the-fire-pickers, become too intimate. Heigh
resto! in an instant Ifrighten one with an apparition of a Great
ear in the Balkan provin and I provide the other with terrible
war-dancing in Eastern Africa. The Great Bear himself is not
inclined to dance, just now, but he shall foot the Zardas before I
have done with him. For my most conceited neighbour, you know
to whom Irefer, I prepared a pretty pic-nic among the morasses of
Madagascar... I have also, to his ever-to-be-regretted cost, invited
him to have high words with the noisy Power about the flesh pots of
Egypt. A conceited Iberian monkey has, on more than one occasion,
made rude faces at me. It less time than it takes to smoke a Cuban
cigar, I have induced my good Translantic friend to F. his ears,
and Í have, for the chattering magpie next door to him, a rod in
pºle. which shall be laid on not a thousand leagues from Delagoa
ay. In the far East I ...tº a very effective drama in
which celestial, pigtails got handsomely japanned, and I am busily
preparing another wondrously-intricate piece of the same nature.
So you see I keep them all *mployed and myself entertained.”
... But then, Sire,” I cried,"you must be omnipotent.”
.."I am,” he replied, proudly drawing himself up till the eagle on
his helmet knocked some drops off the crystal chandelier. “I shall
soon be master of the universe, sun, moon, and stars included.”
At this moment an individual in uniform glided into the room, and,
with respectful obeisance, presented a note, heavily sealed with redwax,
to the August One. He tore it open with a triumphant smile; but, as
he read, his countenance changed to an expresion of concentrated
fury.
"àeast, brutes! Unmentionable scoundrels!” he cried savagely;
and then perceiving me, he crumpled up the missive and flung it full
in my face. Clutching the precious document in my right hand, and
forgetting to pick up my hat and umbrella, I fled from the palace
and rushed to the railway station. The Brussels express was just
leaving, and I sank exhausted on the velvet cushions of a first-class
carriage. What a terrible journey all on your account. Happily I
was not pursued. Not till we had passed the frontier did I remove
the letter from my boot and devour its contents. It ran as follows:–
“SIRE,--The Reichstag declines to spend another mark on never-
to-be-satisfied naval armaments.-Your devoted, Won M.”
Now I understand the †. One's wrath, and so I hope do you.
Awaiting the ever-beneficial and welcome cheque, I am

To-night Edward GREY placed under renewed obligations from same
quarter. SAM SMITH submitted case of Armeniain one of those forceful,
&\º
w NºW
lº.
The Latest Surprise from the Transvaal.
EdwahD GREY about to follow when SILoMIo took the
floor. Evidently in best form; his noble nature stirred to deepest
depths by aspersions upon the gentle Turk. It was true that, i.
his will, in anguished suppression of his instincts, Turk had butchered
a few Armenians, including women and children. But it was all the
fault of SAM SMITH. ith terrible voice, with fat forefinger
ominously shaken in his direction, SILoM10 denounced the blameless
SAMUEL and “his co-atrocity-mongers,” as directly responsible for
any little misunderstanding that may have arisen between the
Turks and their Christian fellow-subjects, resulting in bayoneting,
burning alive, dismembering, and other extreme controversial pro-
ceedings. After this blatant performance-suggestive in tone and
manner, as SARK says, of the Walk-up, Walk-up Gentleman in
front of the fair caravan just before the show begins—came Edward
GBEY with his ". manner, his high tone, his studiously fair-
mindedness. To him succeeded GEORGE CUbzoN in far away the
best speech he has yet made in the House. A difficult position for
the spokesman of Foreign Office met with a courage, frankness and
dexterity that charmed the gathering audience.
“Nothing, my dear Toby,” said Prince ARTHUR, looking down
from the pyramidal heights of his thirty-eight years, “has for a long
time given me keener pleasure than listening to these two speeches.
Endurance of the strength and fame of the House of Commons rests
not with the old Parliamentary Hands, but with the jeune école. As
long as we have young men like Edward GREY and GEORGE CURzoN
coming forward, so long will the Mother House of Parliament maintain
her high reputation.”
Curious to find PBINCE ARTHUR º naturally assuming these
patriarchal airs. By-and-by we shall have him adopting Mr. G.'s
# º and talking solemnly about having arrived “at my time
of life.”
Business done.—Government admit they can do nothing to help
Armenia. “Wery well,” says the House, cheerfully; “go on doing it.”
Thursday.--Dr. TANNER is becoming disappointed with the new
SPEAKER. He looks so bland, has such pleasant voice, such courteous
manner. Seems as if you could do anything with him. TANNER
discovers that, as he puts it, the leg is on the other boot. No chance
for a sportive member. *...* TANNER, attempting to raise
point of order when House had been cleared for division, had every
advantage taken of him. Happened to be #ing under gallery above
Gangway when opportunity presented itself. Sprang to his feet to
address Chair. That he knew was out of order. Supposing when
.# stirring speeches which are all too brief for appetite of de-
#. ouse,
his seat or taking off his hat, he would forthwith behaled forth and
castinto lowest dungeon beneath the castle moat. On the contrary, if,
House being cleared for a division, a Member having something to
say courteously rises, bows to the SPEAKER, and opens his mouth,
he is borne down with angry cries of “Order! Order!” . Accordin
to fundamental principle of British Constitution, a Member in suc
circumstances must remain seated, press his hat over his brows, and
cry aloud, “Mr. SPEAKER!”
TANNER wouldn't have minded that, only, unfortunately, hadn't
got a hat handy. Mr. G. once, in similar circumstances, accepted
loan of FARRER HERSCHELL's hat—an accidental service which ulti-
mately landed the then Member for Durham on the Woolsack.
TANNER having no Lord Chancellorships to give away, no one would
lend him a hat. Before he could “convey” one, oppºrtunity fled.
When, later, he attempted to rºpºre it, bellowing “No!” when
SPEAKER said “The Ayes have it,” SPEAKER ignored his existence,
and declared motion carried.
These things happened yesterday. “I’ll be even with him yet,”
said this relic of the Old Guard. just on the stroke of midnight,
after long debate on Shipbuilding Vote, TANNER rose. If he spoke
for three minutes would carry debate over to another sitting. PRINCE
ARTHUR, swift as hawk on hapless pigeon, pounced.
“I beg to move,” he said, “that the question be now put.”
“Gagl Gag l’ roared TANNER in fury.
Then the SPEAKER, in provokingly quiet manner, observed, that if
this sort of thing went on he would have to call the attention of
House to his conduct. “And this is a so-called free country!” said
TANNER, stamping out to the Division Lobby.
Business done.—House got into Committee on Shipbuilding Vote.
Friday.—SUTHERLAND, K.C.M.G., back, after six weeks, in the
alternating sunshine and, snow of Riviera. “Hope you haven't
been overworking yourself,” I said, regarding with anxious solicitude
his pensive countenance.
“No,” said the Chairman of the P. & 0.1 with hands deep in his
pockets, and a far-away look in his eyes... “But you see, a big con-
cern like ours requires constant care and absolute self-devotion on the
part of those who manage its affairs. One must have his eye every-
where. Bombay, Calcutta, Yokohama, and the Australian ports
loom large on our list. But the Chairman must also keep in personal
touch with smaller ports, such as Rome, Florence, Cannes, and
Monte Carlo.”
Business done -Well, we pretty equally divided the sitting
between a local Belfast Bill and discussion of new scheme of Naval
Defence. The Belfast Corporation Bill, as more important, had
-
“It had been said that such ideas as he held were prehistoric doctrines.
Well, he would rather have the doctrine of a prehistoric statesman than the
ravings of an up-to-date Jingo. (Laughter.) What was the good of a man if
he had to walk about in heavy armour all his life. (Laughter.)”—Sir
Wilfrid Lawson, March 6.

debate in progress a Member were to join in it without rising from

A WORD AGAINST GUSH,
AND FOR “THE OLD GANG.”
(Not by Alg-rm-n Ch-rl-s Sw-nb-rne.)
THE Queen of the Sea said one morning:
“The mightiest of statesmen on earth
Are themes for the lute-thrummer's scirning,
And matters for minstrelish mirth.
With bothers and pothers
I’m having a bad time;
To school me, and rule me
I’ll try the lords of rhyme.
“Their verses pipe praise of my story,
My power is the theme of their choice.
The wrath of my waves is their glory,
Sea-storms, they declare, are my voice.
Thiſ fear it who hear it.
(Though poets have told me
They sicken, sore-striken
When they are on the sea.)
“As lords of my fate and my keepers,
In charge of my shores and my ships,
I'll try these sweet chirpers and cheepers,
Who love me so much-with their lips.
They’re haters of traitors,
False friends or foes descried.
Tº 'll shatter and scatter
y foemen far and wide.
“There’s ALGERNoN, rapid in rancour;
There's WILLIAM, who #: at Turk guile;
There’s ALFRED-on him I may anchor;
There's LEwis, on whom the Rads smile.
They deem them, or dream them,
Greater than the great dead;
They’re sunken, drunken,
In patriot wrath, blood-red.
“I’ll try their afflatus in action!
WEG's gone, and his É. is not known;
While faction is squabbling with faction,
Like dogs who contend for a bone.
They care not, they spare not,
hen at each other's throats;
They muster, and bluster,
“Blind ranks and bellowing votes.”
“The poets are now my solº peerage!
They will not come º: mobs;
Of singers it seems the small-beer-age,
But—bardlings won't º jobs.
The sobbing and throbbing
Of lyres my State may save;
They sneer not, and jeer not
At Britons rule the Wave!”
+ + - -
Alas! the Bards split into parties,
As bitter as bitter could be.
Yelled ALGERNoN, “Hireling ! True Art is
To sing-upon shore—of the Seal
In justice, my trust is;
lf foeman nearer creep,
Fierce curses—in verses-
Will drive them to the deep!”
Wailed WILLIAM: “Our i. was right royal,
But duty no longer we heed.
Dashed ABDUL laughs at us, disloyal,
We sacrifice glory to greed.
No nation holds station
More low than England now.
Oh, Britain, gold-bitten,
CAIN's brand is on thy brow!”
Moaned ALFRED: “Oh, rhyme withoutreason!
Our England is calm, not asleep.
To rail at her thus is high treason,
Her bastions of brine she will keep.
The wages of ages
Of commerce she has kept.
Fame fails them, shame veils them,
Who dare suggest she—slept!”
“Nay,” LEwis retorted, “we know it,
This brag about power and fame,
You call yourself patriot and poet?
The glory you hymn is our shame!
f. darker and starker
Is standing at our gate;
Those Tories our glories
Will shadow, sure as fate!”
- - - -
The QUEEN muttered: "Ah! much I mis-
doubt me!
F'en Bards are not all on one side.
I’d best bind my armour about me,
And look to my statesmen for guide.
These singers are slingers
Of mud, like party bands.
Lute twanglers are wranglers,
And fight, with grubby hands!
“If ALGY meets ALF at my gateway,
They pause and shy stones by the gate.
If WILLIAM sees Edwin, why straightway
Each other they slangwhang and slate.
My story, my glory,
#. sing, but, oh, dear me!
Power rose not, and grows not,
By—gush about the Seal”
A NAVAL QUESTION.—Mr. Robes PIERRE
TAPPERTIT writes from the Jacobin Club,
Seven Dials, to inquire whether Mr. Gosch EN
ought not, like CHARLEs THE FIRST, to be
impeached for endeavouring to levy-ship
money?

Miss Minerva is chucked, and no muffins !
That Periwot wett at the door
Of Tom My MooRE's Parrydise, CHARLIE,-a
me I’d to mug as a kid, - -
Must 'ave felt pooty much like the lydies to
whom the B.A. is forbid.
Quite right and scrootnoodleous, CHARLIEl
ot next, and wot next, and wot next?
I tell you, old man, it’s fair monstrous, the
way we get worried and yext,
Us men as is men and not mollies, by Woman's
Rights 'umbug and Flop;
And it’s yum-yum to find there's still Dons
as can twirl Mrs. PARTINGTON's mop.
I'm not Hoxford or Cambridge, wus luck!—
º of course, at this time of the year,
When I’ve got my small bit on the Boat
Race, as Hoxford will land me, no fear.
She'as pulled methrough prºper some seasons,
and so I still back the Dark Blue,
And I’m happy to see there's no chance of
her running a feminine crew.
Dark Blue don't mean bluestocking, CHARLIE,
and lor, there’s some comfort, old chap;
We're a deal too much petticoat-governed, a
rule as means treatle and pap.
A nice bit of frock is all right, while she plays
second fiddle all through,
But not as a Batchlor of Arts, or the stroke
of a 'Warsity crew.
Factis, women are sneaking our rights, hunder
cover of claiming their own;
And it’s time as us men put our foot down,
afore the she-sarpºnt's full grown.
A good manly crusher, dear CHARLIE, whilst
woman is hunder our 'eel,
Will save us a dollop of trouble, as no doubt
Keep ’em out, my dear boy, keep ’em out!
They’ve bin creeping and creeping for
ears.
No, ain't as I’m down on the donahs as
donahs;–I love 'em, the dears!
But as cricketers, footballers, doctors, M.P.'s,
., and the dickens knows wot,
Likewise B.A.’s and that, I agree with the
Dons that it’s all tommy-rot.
A man as is really a man, mate, and not a
mere molly in bags, -
Knows that women was made to knock under,
in spite of them Radical rags.
While us men ſet the pace, my dear CHARLIE,
no doubt we can romp in in front;
But if shemales git sprinting away, on their
own, we mayn't be in the 'unt.
And that’s wot they're arter, my pippin, as
won't do at no price at all.
They may mug up, and pass, and all that, but
, they mustn't shove men to the wall!
Lor', life's a'ard row, as it is, and our easies
is wonderful few;
But we must 'ave the pull in the pace, and
we must 'ave first cut at the screw.
BETsy Bosh EM, B.A.! There’s a picturel
Minerva is drawn with a owl;
Does she think that a 'Varsity Don is a similar
species of fowl,
As big and as bleared in the goggles, as blind
to the true time o' º
No, no, sling your hook, Miss Bluestocking,
and cart your old poultry away!
“Wot do you know of Hoxford, or Cambridge,
of college or knowledge, young fool?
The cheap sporting Pypers your books, and the
streets and the “public” your school;
Your B.A. . Braggart Ass,
in back-slang and the hodds
Yah! Stick to your gutter snipe patter, and
jour exams.
So snaps snarly old-SNIPE of our club. Was a
schoolmaster once, so 'tis said; -
But 'is duds are as seedy as Guy For, 'is
nose end's remarkable red.
But if I say one word agin women, or progress,
'e always chips in,
And givesmewot for’ot and 'ot, -till Istand

Poor old himage, 'e 'as got a tongue on 'im,

But talk agin larning or lydies, and don't

The way it came about was in this wise. Lord ARTHUR RANTIPole,
who is on the best terms with all the theatrical and musical people,
begged my dear friend Mrs. PIANTAGENET-NIBBs (née DE WILRins;
to accept aPºſt box, which had been placed at his disposal by the
manager of the Eldorado Theatre of Varieties, and she very kindly
asked me to join her party. At first I demurred, knowing that papa
is so tery particular, but the curiosity which we all inherit from the
Grand Old Gardener's wife overcame my scruples, and now I not
Qnly do nºt regret the escapade but long to repeat it, feeling quite
ºulºpardière and outre Manche, Lord ARTHUR and a young poet
Mr. SwinBURNE JENKINs, who has written a play º the crue
LoRD.CHAMBERLAIN refuses to license, accompanied us, I was rather
surprised that Mr. JENKINs should have condescended to visit the
Eldorado, but, throwing back his raven chepelure, he assured me that
the most brilliant gems often coruscated in the most tenebrous
Caverns. ...He's alluding to his father's goal pits,” said Lord
ARTHUR: “ why the Eldorado is the most delightful den of wicked-
ness *::::::::: I really began to think myself a female DANIEL
when his lordship alluded to dens, for he is such a fashionable lion
himself. Not young, but so distingué, a chevalier whom it would
be impossible to mistake for a waiter in his habit de soir"even
without the tasteful silk waistcoat, which a Great Personage
-
of noblemen, and the stately manner in, which he pressed, me to
accept a glass of soda-water mingled with equ de pie would have
done honour to a Doge of Venice on his nuptials with the Adriatic.
Lord ARTHUR has what is called a speaking countenance. A flash
from his steel-grey eyes made the lacquey who supplied our refresh-
ment tremble when he was found wanting in no less a sum than
threepence in the change of half-a-sovereign. I recognised the
alcohol in an instant. It is one which is only to be procured not a
hundred, miles from 3002, Milk, Avenue, E.C., and the soda-water
had all the sparkle of that supplied to the Royal Family y the best
Manufacturer in Great Britain. (You see, darling, that I can still
circumvent a malicious and ungrateful Editor.) But revenons & nos
agneaur. The Eldorado is like a McQrish dream, a revival of the
glories of Granada, when the crescent bade defiance to that Castile
which is now only famed for an exceedingly emollient soap. The
canary silk hangings of our box could not have costless than three
guineas a yard, and the great crimson velvet curtain which hung
behind the footlights would cut up into court dresses for Arch-
duchesses. Everywhere the lustrous eyes of Electra look down
upon the lavish display of gold and crystal which ornament this
temple of harmonious luxury. How Lord ARTHUR could call it a
den passes my poor comprehension. But then to those reared in
feudal palaces a recherché villa at Clapham would be but a mean
domicile. ...All the gentlemen in the audience were smoking. I
confess I liked to see this dissipation. It made the expedition ever
so much more risqué, especially when naughty Mrs. PLANTAGENET-
NIBBs insisted upon taking some whiffs from Mr. JENKINs's cigar at
the back of the box. Lord ARTHUR, who is a confirmed quiz, said if
Mrs. P.-N. puffed too much she would ruin her complexion. Quel
dróle n'est ce pas ? The entertainment on the stage came upon me
with the agreeable shock of one's first attempt at swallowing an
oyster. It was so strange and yet so delicious. The ballets appeared
to me to be worthy of the Court of SARDANAPALUs, and I could not
help clapping my hands vigorously when Mlle. MollKT, the pre-
mière danseuse, executed a series of bounds, which a chamois could
scarcely have equalled. I noted that this exquisite Terpsichorean
reveller wore a necklace of pearls, which, if not Roman, would
certainly have ransomed RICHARD COEUR DE LION twice over. Lord
ARTHUR tells me that it is no uncommon thing for the highest
members of the aristocracy to pay tribute in kind to the talents of
les. belles des coulisses, and that some of them. have to hire
policemen to escort them to and from the theatre. Well, such is the
just reward of fame! A vocalist, who sang in a language which I
did not understand—Lord ARTHUR said it was called Yiddish—con-
yulsed the house with his drolleries, but I preferred a lady who
balanced ninepins on the tip of her somewhat up-tilted nose. Every:
body got up and cheered when a singer, dressed as a Field-marshal
—such a leonine man, not unlike Lord W-LS-L-Y —warbled a
splendid patriotic ditty with this stirring refrain:—
“For battle I am all arrayed, Of Germany I'm not afraid,
I do not care for life or limb; For I can fight like Doctor JIM.”
Mr. Sw1NBURNE JENKINs said that “limb' and “JIM’” did not
rhyme, but the people did not enter into this question of poetic
license. They only roared the chorus. The closing item of the pro-
gramme was a number of tableauz rivants. I can only draw a veil
over the performers. Heaven knows they wanted it badly enough.
Lord ARTHUR said the effect was “most fetching,” and even Mr.
JENKINs praised some of the poses as being “ineffably Greek.” My
hostess was rather indignant with Lord ARTHUR when she asked him
“How would you like to see me as Diana P” and he answered,
“Wery much; so long as I wasn't cast for Actaeon.” No one but an
Eton and Oxford man could make such classic repartee. But some-
thing astonished me more than the living pictures. As we were
leaving the place we passed a refreshment alcove were some noisy
people were drinking together. One man gave vent to his hilarity
in a very familiar tone. I turned to look and there, filling a lady's
glass with **** was PAPA, le père noble of our domestic circle!
No wonder that I clutched Mr. JENKINs's arm with such un-
maidenly fervour that I felt him wince under the pressure, and was
it not natural that on arrival chez moi I should pass the night suffer-
ing with migraine f My misguided parent does not know that I saw
him, and I have only one rayon de soleil-he didn't see me. Mean-
time I am fasting for my sins, and can highly recommend this
potáge maigre. Stew, half-a-dozen, sticks of maccaroni, in a pint

II.
THE TRELAwNEY BRowNEs have arrived.
They made their appearance this morning.
They were on the Parade for an hour or two,
three of them, two girls and a man. Young
SMITH's glass was glued to them for five
and twenty minutes. “Clippers, bejovel
Clippers!” he murmured, as he followed
them up and down. “Ah!” he said to ADA,
“there’s style for you, if you likel . That’s
what the French people call ayclar, you
know.” -
Young SMITH rather prides himself on his
French accent. Last summer he went over to
Boulogne for a day, and for a month or two
afterwards (when he happened to think of it)
he had almost forgotten his English. “Ah!”
he continued, still studying the new-comers
through his glass. “What an air distangy /
Those frocks hail from WoRTH's or the
Luvver, or I’m a Dutchman, ADA!”
ADA's eve followed the direction of the tele-
scope, and the smile died on her lips. Was
it jealousy; Presentiment? The shadow of
coming events? Poor little ADA! Beside
these “clippers” she looked a mere nobody,
and she was conscious of it.
Young SMITH is a wonderful judge of cha-
racter. At the very first glance he decided
that the new comers had “style,” and before
the morning was out he overheard the fol-
lowing conversation, which confirmed his
judgment.
“The Colonel won't be down for another
week. ALGY,” said Miss TRELAwNEY BRowNE.
º § ?” drawled her brother.
“No; he is detained in town by Parlia-
ment.”
“Awful bothaw.”
Young SMITH pricked up his ears. Colonels,
even common Colonels, were a cut above him;
but Colonels who sat in Parliamentſ Phion f
"You had a letter from Sir GEORGE this
morning?” asked the second Miss TRELAw-
NEY BROWNE.
“Ya-as. The Ba'net wants me to go north
for the last of the hunting, you know.”
Young SMITH's eyes dilated. Baronets and
hunting! It was not *ś day that #.
SMITH listened to talk e this. Before
tea-time all Little Puddleton knew what he
had heard. “They seem nice sort of people
these TRELAwNEY BRowNEs,” he said; “well
connected, and all that sort of thing. I heard
young BROWNE say that some Baronet had
asked him to go hunting.”
Young SMITH has an elder sister, and her
name is MADGE. Young SMITH does not think
much of her—“not one of my sort, you
know;” but HARRY Jon Es, ADA's fifth and
favourite brother, reckons her divine. There
is nothing HARRY wouldn't do for MADGE.
He has called his cutter after her; he blacked
a boy's eye because he said she squinted; and,
when he is in funds, he brings her packets of
fruit-tablets from the enny-in-the-slot ma-
chine. The other day HARRY caught sight of
ADA's photograph. ADA was frightened, for
HARRY is a great tease, and she thought she
would never hear the end of it. But HARRY
was intensely interested. He wanted to know
how much it cost. ADA couldn't tell him.
He supposed it could be done cheaper without
8. ſº And ADA thought yes, certainly it
could.
Afew minutes afterwards HARRY was down
on the beach in consultation with the photo-
grapher. , The regular charge was sixpence
eacn—a g for a group of two. ould
that include a frame? o, only a pink
#. mount. A frame was fourpence extra.
ARRY's face fell. He would give the world

“WHAT ARE YER TRYIN' TER CATCH-MICE f"
only fivepence-halfpenny. It was no use
in: Pa for an #. was such an old
screw; and ADA? ADA had half-a-crown in
her purse, but she was not allowed to change
it. uld the 5.º. possibly do it for
less? - HARRY hated bargaining; but, hang
it! what was a fellow to do Well, yes,
to oblige the gentleman, the photographer
thought he might take the two for ninepence.
Fivepence-halpenny from ninepence, that
left fourpence -h nny—no, threepence,
wasn't it? HARRY could never tackle arith-
metic, and, when there was a fraction, he
always felt uncertain. He thanked the photo-
rapher, and said he would think of it. Half
the day he spent devising schemes to raise the
residue. He volunteered to rig out Johnny's
boat for threepence, and to mend the little
Robinson-boy's cycle-horse for a hº
His offers were declined with suspicion; Paltry
gettinÉ it, and HARRY sat about all the after-
1
noon, biting his nails, and frowning. He was
in fact, quite metamorphosed. Pa Jones did
not once have to tell him how many bad acci-
| dents he had seen, and Ma Jones began to
fear he was developing influenza. The whole
household was altered. Not one raid did
HARRY make into the nursery; not one doll
did he Jack-the-Ripper; not once did he pull
the twins by , the hair, nor smack little
ToDDLEs's head. ADA alone had an inkling
of his ailment, and offered her sympathy;
but HARRY would none of it. He sat apart
in melodramatic silence, brooding over, his
wrongs, and cursing the fate that left him
to struggle through life on such a limited
1ncome,
“Thou ART so NEAR AND YET so FAR.”-

much of her—“not one of my sort, you
know;” but HARRY Jones, ADA's fifth and
favourite brother, reckons her divine. There
is nothing HARRY wouldn't do for MADGE.
He has called his cutter after her; he blacked
a boy's eye because he said she squinted; and,
when he is in funds, he brings her packets of
fruit-tablets from the enny-in-the-slot ma-
chine. The other day HARRY caught sight of
ADA's photograph, ADA was frightened, for
HARRY is a great tease, and she thought she
would never hear the end of it. But HARRY
was intensely interested. He wanted to know
how much it cost. ADA couldn't tell him.
He supposed it could be done cheaper without
a * ? And ADA thought yes, certainly it
could.
Afew minutes afterwards HARRY was down
on the beach in consultation with the photo-
grapher. , The regular charge was sixpence
each—a shilling for a group of two. ould
that include a frame? o, only a pink
#. mount. A frame was fourpence extra.
ARRY's face fell. He would give the world

only fivepence-halfpenny. It was no use
*i; Pa for anything, he was such an old
screw; and ADAP ADA had half-a-crown in
her purse, but she was not allowed to change
it. Could the photographer possibly do it for
less? - HARRY hated bargaining; but, hang
it! what was a fellow to do Well, yes,
to oblige the gentleman, the photographer
thought he might take the two for ninepence,
Fivepence-halpenny from ninepence, that
left fourpence - half y—no, threepence,
wasn't it? HARRY could never tackle arith-
metic, and, when there was a fraction, he
always felt uncertain. He thanked the photo-
; er, and said he would think of it. Half
the day he spent devising schemes to raise the
residue. He volunteered to rig out JoHNNY’s
boat for threepence, and to mend the little
Robinson-boy's cycle-horse for a Hº:
His offers were declined with suspicion; Paltry
getting it, and HARRY sat about all the after-
noon, biting his nails, and frowning. He was
in fact, quite metamorphosed. Pa Jones did
not once have to tell him how many bad acci-
dents he had seen, and Ma Jon Es began to
fear he was developing influenza. The whole
household was altered. Not one raid did
HARRY make into the nursery; not one doll
did he Jack-the-Ripper; not once did he pull
the twins by the hair, nor smack little
ToDDLes's head. ADA alone had an inkling
of his ailment, and offered her sympathy;
but HARRY would none of it. He sat apart
in melodramatic silence, brooding over, his
wrongs, and cursing the fate that left him
to struggle through life on such a limited
Income.

THE SUNDAY PLEASURE-SEEKER'S
WADE MECUM,
(Compiled by a Thoughtful Man in the Street.)
Question. I may take it that you are satis-
fied with the Division in the House of Commons
concerning the Sunday opening of museums
in the Metropolish -
Answer. Certainly; the more especially as
it is the first time that'such an event can be
recorded. -
Q. And the fact that the majority of the
House are Conservatives adds to the triumph”
A. Quite so, as the Opposition are generally
accepted as the only supporters of progress.
Q. If the London museums come to be
opened as proposed, what will be the probable
result P
. A. That for several weeks those places of
instruction, if not amusement, will be crowded
on the day added to the list.
Q. And afterwards?
A. Then, judging from provincial prece-
dents, the novelty will wear off, and the
number of Sunday visitors will fall to the
level of the average week-day attendance, or
even lower.
Q. Will the Oli Mes'ers have a beneficial
effect on the average artisanº
4. It is to be hoped so, although sceptics
and scoffers may urge that the Old Masters
have not done much to improve the taste of
persons moving in a more exalted sphere of
Society.
Q. Have not Free Libraries been a sweet
boon to the working-man?

Q. But will not the picture galleries—Old

In the second edition of The Red Badge of
Courage are to be found excerpts from some of the
Press notices which hailed the first edition. In one
Iread that “Mr. STEPHEN CRANE's picture of the
effect of actual fighting onaraw regimentis º

imaginative strength. . . . . This extraordinary
book will appeal sº the insatiable desire to
know the psychology of war—how the sights and
sounds, the terrible details of the drama of battle,
affect the senses and the soul of man.” “The
reader,” says another, “sees the battle not from
afar, but from the inside,” “This, we feelinstinc-
tively, is something like thereality of war.” These
are samples of the eulogies which have been libe-
rally showered upon The Red Badge of Courage.
It will have been noticed that the common note
struck by the reviewer is the masterly analysis of
the reality of war. This is curious, for it turns out
that Mr. CRANE is a young man of the age of 24,
who, being an American, has presumably no per-
sonal knowledge whatever of the emotions he
undertakes to describe. And it may further be as-
sumed that nine out of ten of his critics are in a
similar case. These, therefore, who are ignorant of
war and its emotions testify to the absolute reality
of war-pictures, painted by one who has himself
never been near a battle. I am conscious of the
retort that may be made, and I am prepared to
admit at once that I myself have never fought
through a battle or been near one; norhaye I ever
occupied the position of referee at afootball match.
All I sayis, that this very confused and disjointed
account of warfare does not impress me as bein
anything likewhat thereal thing ought to be; an
I may go further, and add that, written, as it is,
by a young American of 24, it cannot fossibly
possess the quality of “intimate knowledge”
with which it has been almost universally credited
by those who have reviewed it.
IHAve read many stories of war, some imagina-
tive, some written by men who had borneatherein
the fighting. I have spoken to many men who have
fought—modest, manly fellows, for the most part,
and by no means inclined to exaggerate either their
own heroism or that of their companions. And,
putting aside all the tawdrynonsenseof romancers,
who give you merely the tinsel glitter of war, I
much doubt if “the youth” whose heart-search-
ings are described in The Red Badge of Courage
is at all a common type. The mass of men may not
be brave todesperation; but they are braver, I take
it, than this poor, sickly, sentimental, hysterical
fool, who is constantly engaged in probing his own
sensations when he ought to be loading and firin
his rifle. The great battles cf the world have
been fought by common men, and common men in
the mass are brave and not cowardly. MICHAEL
BHARDY, who is commemorated in Sir EVELYN
Wood's book on the Crimea, was a common man;
the heroesofthe 14"h Regiment of the French army
who perished almost to a man at Eylau, were com
mon men; so were the sergeant and his men to
whose memory Sir FRANCIS HASTINGs Doyle has
dedicated The Red Thread of Honour, one of the
noblest and most stirring battle-poems in our lan-
guage. And for myself, I prefer the heroes of
The Red Thread of Honour to the miserable
creature who is dimly revealed to us in The Red
Badge of Courage.
I HAys said nothing of the literary and gram-
matical §: of the book. Here are two examples.
“Buried in the smoke of many rifles, his anger
was directed not so much against the men whom he
knew were rushing towards him, as against the
swirling battlephantoms which were choking him.”
“A lad whose face had borne an expression of
exalted courage, the majesty of he who dares give
his life, was, at an instant, smitten abject.” On
the whole, I cannot in the least agree with the
reviewer who declares that, “as a work of art,
The Red Badge of Courage deserves high praise.
As a moral lesson that mankind still needs, the

THE book professes to be thestoryof a youth truthwhich is the mark of really greatfiction.
praise it deserves is higher still.”

In the second edition of The Red Badge of
Courage are to be found excerpts from some of the
Press notices which hailed the first edition. In one
Iread that “Mr. STEPHEN CRANE's picture of the

imaginative strength. . . . . This extraordinary
book will appeal strongly to the insatiable desire to
know the psychology *war—how the sights and
sounds, the terrible details of the drama of battle,
affect the senses and the soul of man.” “The
reader,” says another, “sees the battle not from
afar, but from the inside.” “This, we feelinstinc-
tively, is something like thereality of war.” These
are samples of the eulogies which have been libe-
rally showered upon The Red Badge of Courage.
It will have been noticed that the common note
struck by the reviewer is the masterly analysis of
thereality of war. This is curious, for it turns out
that Mr. CRANE is a young man of the age of 24,
who, being an American, has presumably no per-
sonal knowledge whatever of the emotions he
undertakes to describe. And it may further beas-
sumed that nine out of ten of his critics are in a
similar case. These, therefore, who are ignorant of
war and its emotions testify to the absolute reality
of war-pictures, painted by one who has himself
never been near a battle. I am conscious of the
retort that may be made, and I am prepared to
admit at once that I myself have never fought
through a battle or been near one; norhaye I ever
occupied the position of referee at afootball match.
All I say is, that this very confused and disjointed
account of warfare does not impress me as being
anything likewhat the real thing ought to be; and
I may go further, and add that, written, as it is,
by a young American of 24, it cannot possibly
possess the quality of “intimate knowledge'.
with which it has been almost universally credited
by those who have reviewed it.
IHAVE read many stories of war, some imagina-
tive, some written by men who had borneathare in
the fighting. I have spoken to many men who have
fought—modest, manly fellows, for the most part,
and by no means inclined to exaggerate either their
own heroism or that of their companions. And,
putting aside all thetawdrynonsenseof romancers,
who give you merely the tinsel glitter of war, I
much doubt if “the youth” whose heart-search-
ings are described in The Red Badge of Courage
is at all a common type. The mass of men may not
be brave todesperation; but they are braver, I take
it, than this poor, sickly, sentimental, hysterical
fool, who is constantly engaged in probing his own
sensations when he ought to be loading and firin
his rifle. The great battles (f the world have
been fought by common men, and common men in
the mass are brave and not cowardly. MICHAEL
HARDY, who is commemorated in Sir EVELYN
Wood's book on the Crimea, was a common man;
the heroesofthe 14th Regiment of the French army
who perished almost to a man at Eylau, were com
mon men; so were the sergeant and his men to
whose memory Sir FRANCIs HASTINGs Doyle has
dedicated The Red Thread of Honour, one of the
noblest and most stirring battle-poems in our lan-
guage. And for myself, I prefer the heroes of
The Red Thread of Honour to the miserable
creature who is dimly revealed to us in The Red
Badge of Courage.
I HAVE said nothing of the literary and gram-
matical style of the book. Here are two examples.
“Buried in the smoke of many rifles, his anger
was directed not so much against the men whom he
knew were rushing towards him, as against the
swirling battlephantoms which were choking him.”
“A lad whose face had borne an expression of
exalted courage, the majesty of he who dares give
his life, was, at an instant, smitten abject,” Qn
the whole, I cannot in the least agree with the
reviewer who declares that, “as a work of art,
The Red Badge of Courage deserves Fº

praise it deserves is higher still.”

Old England has need of a Navy.

geese,
Know no more of the facts than this paper,
They'll land us in war whilst they're crying

And smash is the end o' that caper.

JOTTINGS AND TITTLINGS.
(By BABoo HURRY BUNGsHo JABBERJEE, B.A.)
NO, WII,
How Mr. Jabberjee risked a Sprat to capture something very
like a Whale.
I AM this week to narrate an unprecedented stroke of bad luck
occurring to the present writer. The incipience of the affair was the
addressing of a humble petition to the indulgent ear.of Hon’ble
Punch, calling attention to the great copiousness of my literary out-
put, and theardent longing Iexperienced to behold the colour of money
on account. On which, by returning post, my parched soul was re-
invigorated by the refreshing draught of a draft (if I may be
permitted the rather facetious jeu de mots) payable to my order.
So uplifted by pride at finding the insignificant crumbs I had cast
upon #. journalistic waters return to me after numerous days in the
improved form of loaves and fishes, I wended my footsteps to the
bank on which my cheque was
drafted, and requested the
bankers behind the counter to
honour it with the root of all
'evil, which they did with ob-
sequious alacrity.
After closely inspecting the
notes to satisfy myself that I
had not been imposed upon by
meretricious counterfeits, I
merged with a beaming and
joyful countenance, stowing
the needful away carefully in
an interior pocket, and, on
descending the bank step, was
accosted by a polite, agreeable
stranger, who, begging my
pardon with profusion, in-
quired whether he had not
had the honour of voyaging
from India with me in the-
the-for his life he could not
recall the name of the ship—
he should forget his own name
presently l
“Indeed,” I answered him,
“I cannot remember having
the felicity of an encounter
with you upon the Kaisar-i-
FIºnd.”
The Stranger: “To be sure;
that was the name! A truly
magnificent vessell I forget
names—but faces, never! And
yours I remember from the
striking resemblance to my
dear friend, the Maharajah of

second-class passenger, and under an *...* cloud, did not
dare to take the liberty. Now, being on the bed of clover owing to
decease of wealthy uncle, I can address you without the mortifying
fear of misconstruction.”
So, in return, I, without absolutely claiming consanguinity with
the Maharajah (of whom, indeed, I had never heard), did inform
him that I, too, was munching the slice of luck, having just drawn
the princely instalment of a salary for jots and tittles contributed to
eriodical Punch. Whereat he warmly congratulated me, expressing
igh appreciation of my articles and abilities, but exclaiming at the
misèrable paucity of my honorarium, saying he was thick as a thief
with the Editor, and would leave no stone unturned to procure me a
greater adequacy of remuneration for writings that were dirt cheap
at a Jew's eye. -
And presently he invited me to accompany him to a respectable
sort of tavern, and solicited the honour of my having a “peg" at
his expense; to which I, perceiving him to be a good-natured,
simple fellow, inflated by sudden Hº consented, accepting,
:#. to my normal habitude, his offer of a brandy panee, or an

JOTTINGS AND TITTLINGS.
(By BABoo HURRY BUNGsHo JABBERJEE, B.A.)
No. VII.
How Mr. Jabberjee risked a Sprat to capture something very
like a Whale.
I AM this week to narrate an unprecedented stroke of bad luck
occurring to the present writer. The incipience of the affair was the
addressing of a humble petition to the indulgent ear.of Hon’ble
Punch, calling attention to the great copiousness of my literary out-
put, and theardent longing I experienced to behold the colour of money
on account. On which, by returning post, my parched soul was re-
invigorated by the refreshing draught of a draft (if I may be
permitted the rather facetious jeu de mots) payable to my order.
So uplifted by pride at finding the insignificant crumbs I had cast
upon #. journalistic waters return to me after numerous days in the
improved form of loaves and fishes, I wended my footsteps to the
bank on which my cheque was
drafted, and requested the
bankers behind the counter to
honour it with the root of all
evil, which they did with ob-
sequious alacrity.
fter closely inspecting the
notes to satisfy myself that I
had not been imposed upon by
meretricious counterfeits, I
º with a beaming and
joyful countenance, stowing
the needful away carefully in
an interior pocket, and, on
descending the bank step, was
accosted by a polite, agreeable
stranger, who, begging my
pardon with profusion, in-
quired whether he had not
had the honour of voyaging
from India with me in the—
the-for his life he could not
recall the name of the ship—
he should forget his own name
presently l
“Indeed,” I answered him,
“I cannot remember having
the felicity of an encounter
with you upon the Kaisar-i-
Hind.”
The Stranger: “To be sure;
that was the name! A truly
magnificent vessel! I forget
names—but faces, never! And
yours I remember from the
striking resemblance to , my
dear friend, the Maharajah of
Phúlkarribad—you know him?

some c *. A splendid Shi-
karr; 1 was often on the
verge of , asking if you were
related; but being then but a
second-class passenger, and under an *...* cloud, did not
dare to take the liberty. Now, being on the bed of clover owing to
decease of wealthy uncle, I can address you without the mortifying
fear of misconstruction.”
So, in return, I, without absolutely claiming consanguinity with
the Maharajah (of whom, indeed, I had never heard), did inform
him that I, too, was munching the slice of luck, having just drawn
the princely instalment of a salary for jots and tittles contributed to
riodical Punch. Whereat he warmly congratulated me, expressing
igh appreciation of my articles and abilities, but exclaiming at the
miserable paucity of my honorarium, saying he was thick as a thief
with the Editor, and would leave no stone unturned to procure me a
greater adequacy of remuneration for writings that were dirt cheap
at a Jew's eye. -
And presently he invited me to accompany him to a respectable
sort of tavern, and solicited the honour of my having a “peg" at
his expense; to which I, perceiving him to be a good-natured,
simple fellow, inflated by sudden F. , consented, accepting,
ºf: to my normal habitude, his offer † a brandy panee, or an
old Tom.

of a churched mouse. Have you made your fortune, ToMKINS P
Mr. Tomkins. I am too easy a goer, and there are too many rogues
in the world, that I should ever make my own fortune, Johnson
Happily for me, an opulent and ancient avungular relative has lately
departed to reside with the morning stars, and left me wealth outside
the dream of an avaricious!
Mr. Johnson (enviously). God bless my soul! Some folks have
the good luck. (To me, whispering.) A poor ninny-hammer sort of
chap, he will soon throw it away on es and ducks! (Aloud, to
Mr. ToMKINs.) Splendid! I congratulate #. sincerely,
Mr.T. (in a tone of dolesomeness). The heart knoweth where the
shoe pinches it, Johnson. Mylot is not a rose-bed. For my antique
and eccentric relative must needs insert a testamentary condition
commanding me to forfeit the inheritance, unless, within three
calendered months from his last obsequies i shall have distributed
ten thousand pourds amongst
young deserving foreigners.
To-morrow time is up, and I
have still a thousand pounds
to give away ! But how to
discover genuine young de-
serving foreigners in so short
a space? Truly, I go in fear
of losing the whole!
Mr. J. Let me act as your
budli in this and distribute
the remaining thousand.
Mr. T. From what I re-
member of i. as a youth, I
cannot wholly rely on your
discretion. Rather would I
place my confidence in this
gentleman.

spired novelists to write their novels with a
view to reproduction on the stage, and is
likely to turn playwrights, into a sort of
newspaper boys eagerly waiting for novels tº
be given out to them to dramatise. And
where do the public come in? Is the plblic
to read the novel first and then see the play,
or vice versd? And isn't it a six to four
chance that those who have read the story
will not want to see the play? Also, in the
end, will not the practics, should it become
general, be injurious alike to novelist, drama:
tist, and actor; and wearisome to the public?

THE direct effects of the great contest between the two universities

in shoals; it opens the flood-gates of reminiscence in countless
elderly gentlemen, and induces them to relate marvellous stories of
prowess and endurance in bygone years; it covers Putney with dark
and light blue bunting; it decorates the whips of cabmen, bus-
drivers, and butcher-boys; it arrays unconscious dogs in the rival
favours, and ranges them in hostile camps; and it causes sixteen
healthy young men to affront the wind and rain of March, in
clothing which can only be described as just adequate for decency,
and totally inadequate for anything else. There are other effects,
those, for instance, which the ups and downs of practice exercise on
the impressionable minds of the gentlemen of the Stock Exchange,
and on the variegated and descriptive vocabulary of the assiduous

however, she was at least ten minutes before her usual time. The
fact was, that she, too, was bent upon the Sportsman, and had come
down in high hopes of anticipating papa. Seeing, however, that she
was too late, she made an unimportant remark about the weather,

But this is not to be unexpected now
that “the water” is abandoned at

his way about if he is taken over the
course on a steam-launch only a few
days before the race? It stands to
reason that he has no chance with those

And will not there be complaints

unsatisfactory progress of either of
the 'Varsity steamers, or, perchance,
the boat reserved for the Fourth

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Lords, Monday, March 16.-Peers not going to sit
tamely by whilst other House is treated to statement on leading
question of the hour. Rosebery will see to that. When House met
to-day he, with tears in his voice, lamented absence of the MARKIss.
Had not only expected him to be in his place, but looked for him to
rise and make statement about Soudan, at least as full as Commoner
ple in another place were indulged withal. MARKIss came in
ater, with air of guilt not dispelled by affectation of indifference.
When House about to adjourn he explained that he had said nothing
because he was, asked nothing. Pretty to see him demurely fold
his hands over his broad bosom, archly look across table towards
Rosebehy, make dainty courtesy of mock grace, and hum
“Nobody axed me, Sir, she said.”
RoskBERY, not to be put off with these blandishments. “Thought,”
he sternly said, “the FoEEIGN SECRETARY would deem your Lord-
ships not unworthy of a statement similar to that made by the
UNDER SECRETARY in the other House.” Again MARKIss pleaded
that he had not been asked. As Rose BERY cddlv refrained from
putting definitive question invited, nothing was said.
JAMEs of Hereford (late of Bury) brought in Water Bill. SARK
met GRAND CRoss after House rose. Always athirst for informa-
tion, SARK asked what he §: of it. “You’re a great autho-
rity on water, you know,” he added, insinuatingly.
“If you mean,” said GRAND CRoss, looking at him suspiciously,
“that when I was Home Secretary I brought in a London Water
Bill, you're right. If my proposal had been adopted, London would
have had an investment nearly as goºd as that my late esteemed
friend Lord BEACONSFIELD made for the State in the matter of the
Suez Canal. But there are always people who know than the
mºst highly gifted. As for JAMEs's Bill, I am too annoyed to have
followed it closely. You remember that my memory is kept
green in the House of Commons * reason of my having on a memo-
rable occasion said I ‘thought I heard an hon. Member smile.”
thing, but mine own. It has remained unapproached all years. And nowhere's a paltry Poet Laureate attempting to compete
with my masterpiece; ” and GRAND CRoss read out, in voice tremb-
ling with scorn, the Poet Laureate's deathless verse suggested for
monument of the Postman Poet:-
“0 lark-like poet! Carol on,
Lost in dim light, an unseen trill.”
“‘An unseen trill,’ forsooth !” cried GRAND CRoss. “This
ALERID-Austig is just the kind of fellow to, talk of an unheard
smile, and pass the idea off as original. But I'd have him know I
heard a man smile years before he didn't see a trill.” - -
Business done.—Statement in Commons presaging fresh invasion
of Soudan. House thereupon appropriately.p.: ed to consider
Army Estimater, voting a trifle under six ons before you could
say "Dongola!”
Tuesday.—Hicks-BEACH not kind of man to give himself "º:
riotous enjoyment. Temperature rather freezing than sultry. But
to-night had high old time. Never imagined that bi-metallism
covered possibilities of such human joy. Man from WHITELEy's
brought on resolution affirming Fº of bi-metallism. As every-
one #. PRINCE ARTHUR has no philosophic doubts on this
question. Believes thoroughly in bi-metallism. So does CHAPLIN,
“Pass a law establishing bi-metallism,” says that eminent econo-
mist, “and you will have what I may call bi-farming—that is to
say, two º: of corn will grow in every field where hitherto
only one has popped up an undersold head.”
such circumstances, bi-metallists, might, well look hopeful.
Even if CHANCELLoR of Exchequeh did not (if the phrase may in
this connection be used without disrespect) go bald-headed in support
of principle, he at least must treat subject with deference.
Hicks-BEACH began in soothing tone with kindly manner. That
only his artfulness. As soon as he had cleared the ground and
firmly planted his feet thereon, he seized bi-metallism by the throat,
flung it to the ground, kicked and pummelled it till every, three-
penny-bit in its pouch must have been twisted up. For adh-rents
of the true faith this was bad enough. What lent pathos to the
scene was to watch PRINCE ARTHUR and HARRY CHAPLIN seated Bench whence Hicks-BEACH had risen tojº. The very helplessness of their situation added to its

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Lords, Monday, March 16.-Peers not going to sit
tamely by whilst other House is treated to statement on leading
question of the hour. Rosebrity will see to that. When House met
to-day he, with tears in his voice, lamented absence of the MARKIss.
Had not only expected him to be in his place, but looked for him to
rise and make statement about Soudan, at least as full as Commoner
º in, another place were indulged withal... MARKIss, came in
ater, with air of guilt not dispelled by affectation of indifference.
When House about to adjourn he explained that he had said nothing
because he was, asked nothing. Pretty to see him demurely fold
his hands over his broad bosom, archly look across table towards
RoSEBERY, make dainty courtesy of mock grace, and hum
“Nobody axed me, Sir, she said.”
RosBBERY, not to be put off with these blandishments. “Thought,”
he sternly said, “the FoEEIGN SECRETARY would deem your Lord-
ships not unworthy of a statement similar to that made by the
UNDER SECRETARY in the other House.” Again MARKIss pleaded
that he had not been asked. As Rose BERY cddlv refrained from
putting definitive question invited, nothing was said.
JAMEs of Hereford (late of Bury) brought in Water Bill. SARK
met GRAND QRoss after House rose. Always athirst for informa-
tion, SARK asked what he thought of it. “You’re a great autho-
rity on water, you know,” he added, insinuatingly.
... If you mean,” said GRAND CRoss, looking at him suspiciously,
...that when I was Home Secretary I brought in a London Water
Bill, you're right. If my proposal had been adopted, London would
have had an investment nearly as goºd as that my late esteemed
friend Lord BEACONSFIELD made for the State in the matter of the
Suez Canal. But there are always people who know better than the
most highly gifted. As for JAMEs's #. I am too annoyed to have
followed it closely. You remember that my memory is kept
green in the House of Commons by reason of my having on a memo-
years. And nowhere’s a paltry Poet Laureate attempting to compete
with my masterpiece; ” and GRAND CRoss read out, in voice tremb-
ling with scorn, the Poet Laureate's deathless verse suggested for
monument of the Postman Poet:-
“0 lark-like poet! Carol on,
Lost in dim light, an unseen trill.” |
“‘An unseen trill,’ forsooth !” oried GRAND CRoss. “This
ALFRID-AUSTIg is just the kind of fellow to talk of an unheard
smile, and pass the idea off as original. But I'd have him know I
heard a man smile years before he didn't see a trill.” - -
Business done.—Statement in Commons presaging fresh invasion
of Soudan. House thereupon appropriately.p: ed to consider

Hicks-BEACH began in soothing tone with kindly manner. That

was a success in more ways than one. In addition to the paternal

keenness to see a debating point, which distinguish the personage he
occasionally refers to as “my right hon, relative.” Pleasant to see
the friendly interest taken in the event “We all like AUSTEN,” not
less in the Liberal camp than in the new country into which he has
dutifully followed his father. An encouraging, cheer greeted his

SARK tells me that in the early days of Mr. GULLY's Speakership,
a time not free from anxiety, his greatest comfort, his most effective
encouragement, came from this good man. In private life, he is
head of firm of solicitors, with assuringly sonorous title. When Mr.
GULLY, not dreaming of the Speaker's Chair, went circuit, Messrs.
BRockBANK, HELDER & Co. sent him briefs. When he came to the
Chair, and seemed to need a little encouragement, it was the practice
of the senior member of BRocKBANKs, casually as it were, to stroll
down the Houſe, his white waistcoat gleaming with benevolence. As
he passed the Speaker's Chair, he nodded in confidential way to his
old client, as who should say, “Cheer up, old man. The Court’s
with you. If it fails, there's BRocKBANK, HELDER & Co. behind.”
In moments of exceptional difficulty, he even winked as he strolled
past the Chair. - -
Not having these early professional relations with the CIVIL LoRD

The volunteer was too tired to speak. He fell asleep from sheer

had marched through mud and ploughed land, and over stony roads

“You look weary, my good woman?” -
“So would you be.” was the angry reply, “if you had passed

“Can't you see we did? But don't stand dawdling there, but do

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
THE Joys of A BoAT-RACE,
IN the Badminton Magazine for this present month of April I
note specially an article, by Mr. C. M. PITMAN, bearing the above
title. It is a spirited and graphic piece of writing, and I heartily
congratulate this gallant young oarsman on his first contribution to
monthly literature. Great Heaven! how the months slip away and
leave no si It seems but yesterday that Mr. PITMAN was stroking
the Oxford eight as a freshman recently imported from Eton. How
brilliantly he took them *:::ff. with how cool a head and with what
excellent judgment did he stall off the spurts in the rival grew until
he finally brought his merry men safely past the “Ship” at Mort-
lake, winners by nearly three lengths. All that seems to me,
ponderin g these matters, to have happened, but yesterday; yet four
years have sped upon their way, and three times more since then did
Mr. PITMAN row in a victorious crew. Now he, too, has gone down
(as they say both at Oxford and at Cambridge); the quads of his
college know him no more, and probably, since oarsmen tend to the
law, he is acquiring an intimate knowledge of procedure, of state-
ments of claim and of defence, of interrogatories, and of the rule in
Shelley's Case, in musty, chambers either of the Temple or of
Lincoln's Inn. In the dim future I behold him, a grave and
reverend Judge of the Supreme Court, presiding with reminiscent
dignity and increased weight at a boat-race dinner.
MR. PITMAN describes no particular race. He gives an account of
the symptoms that afflict, the mind of an oarsman engaged in a race.
Vivid to an almost painful degree is his description of the nervous and
disjointed conversation of a crew at their last meal before the race
of the aimless questions, the irrelevant answers, and the general
assumption of an airy unconcern (it deceives ..º. mark every
member of the crew. This is the state of mind known to Univer-
sity athletes as “needle.” Those who have been º: a similar
experience will be the first to testify to the accuracy of the picture.
IT is at such a time that men decide that there is no pleasure in
rowing, and that no power on earth shall ever induce them to take a
seat in a boat in. Everything seems to have gone wrong; the
world seems to be in a conspiracy against them. What does the
crowd mean by smiling and talking and chaffing P. How dare men
and women gather with casual carelessness to witness the terrible
struggle that is about to take place—a struggle so important to those
who take part in it that they cannot tear their thoughts away from
it for a single moment? These are some of the questions that chase
one, another, through, an oarsman's mind. ... And there are others,
Will he be able to last out the whole course? Is it not possible that
he may collapse utterly when half way over the course, and offer a
shocking spectacle to the assembled thousands? What if he should
catch a crab, or if his oar should break, or if the coxswain should
steer them crashing into a pleasure-boat, or if some one should put
his foot through the frail skin of the racing boat, and cause her to
sink? And so in a sort of dream he dons his shorts, his zephyr and
his shoes, helps to carry the boat down to the water, and mechani-
cally takes his accustomed place. Almost before he realises what
has happened, the crew are at the stake-boat, the umpire has fired
his pistol, and the race has started.
No needle afflicts him now: dismal thoughts and nervousness
have vanished as if by the touch of a magician's wand, and all his
owers, bodily and mental, are concentrated on his work. Last P
hy, he feels he could last till the crack of doom. How it inspires
a man to have the other, crew alongside, to know, they are worthy
†. but yet mortal, men not to be daunted by a single spurt,
or broken up by one or two rolls, but liable notwithstanding to lose
their winds and to fall behind. How the boat springs to each stroke;
Jupiter! what a fearful roll that was; how thin and distant soun
the eldritch shrieks of the coxswain; No.5 in the other crew has got
his slide stuck-splendid!—how curious that pale man on a moored
steamer looked in a green tie. Oh, oh, stroke is quickening—yes,
the crew pick it up with him—gloriousl—but I can follow the race
no farther, for as I write a needle pierces me, and I feel as nervous
as though I saw the whole stress º struggle raging before my eyes.
AND the memories of delightful friendships, of toil endured to-
gether, of victories gloriously celebrated, of defeats manfully endured,
of the little troubles that diversified the monotony of training, the
nicknames of each member of the crew, their little foibles, their
sturdy, honest disbelief in their rivals, their gallant and unquench-
able belief in themselves—all these are to the man who has rowed in
a race a possession for ever. Of this no length of years can rob him;
and as he meets his old companions, and fights his old races over again,
he viſie are to him if that if he had his fifto live once more he
would be a rowing man rather than an g else. That is the con-
clusion to which Mr. PITMAN's article brought me. Those who
wish to know what it means to race should read it for themselves.

pondering these matters, to have happened but yesterday; yet four
years have sped upon their way, and three times more since then did
Mr. PITMAN row in a victorious crew. Now he, too, has gone down
(as, they say both at Oxford and at Cambridge); the quads, of his
college know him no more, and probably, since oarsmen tend to the
law, he is acquiring an intimate knowledge of procedure, of state-
ments of claim and of defence, of interrogatories, and of the rule in
Shelley's Case, in musty, chambers either of the Temple or of
Lincoln's Inn. In the dim future I behold him, a grave and
reverend Judge of the Supreme Court, presiding with reminiscent
dignity and increased weight at a boat-race dinner.
MR. PITMAN describes no particular race. He gives an account of
the symptoms that afflict, the mind of an oarsman engaged in a race.
Vivid to an almost painful degree is his description of the nervous and
disjointed conversation of a crew at their last meal before the race
of the aimless questions, the irrelevant answers, and the general
assumption of an airy unconcern (it deceives ..º. mark every
member of the crew. This is, the state of mind known to Univer-
sity athletes as “needle.” Those who have been ºº:: a similar
experience will be the first to testify to the accuracy of the picture.
IT is at such a time that men decide that there is no pleasure in
rowing, and that no power on earth shall ever induce them to take a
seat in a boat again. Everything seems to have gone wrong; the
world seems to be in a conspiracy against them. What does the
crowd mean by smiling, and talking and chaffing? How dare men
and women gather with casual carelessness to witness the terrible
struggle that is about to take place—a struggle so important to those
who take part in it that they cannot tear their thoughts away from
it for a single moment? These are some of the questions that chase
one another through an oarsman's mind. And there are others.
Will he be able to last out the whole course? Is it not possible that
he may collapse utterly when half way over the course, and offer a
shocking spectacle to the assembled thousands? What if he should
catch a crab, or if his oar should break, or if the coxswain should
steer them crashing into a pleasure-boat, or if some one should put
his foot through the frail skin of the racing boat, and cause her to
sink? And so in a sort of dream he dons his shorts, his zephyr and
his shoes, helps to carry the boat down to the water, and mechani-
cally takes his accustomed place. Almost before he realises what
has happened, the crew are at the stake-boat, the umpire has fired
his pistol, and the race has started.
No needle afflicts him now: dismal thoughts and nervousness
have vanished as if by the touch of a magician's wand, and all his
owers, bodily and mental, are concentrated on his work. Last P
hy, he feels he could last till the crack of doom. How it inspires
a man to have the other crew alongside, to know they are worthy
opponents, but yet mortal, men not to be daunted by a single spurt,
or broken up by one or two rolls, but liable notwithstanding to lose
their winds and to fall behind. How the boat springs to each stroke;
Jupiter! what a fearful roll that was; how thin and distant soun
the eldritch shrieks of the coxswain; No. 5 in the other crew has got
his slide stuck-splendid!—how curious that pale man on a moored
steamer looked in a green tie. Oh, oh, stroke is quickening—yes,
the crew pick it up with him—gloriousl—but I can follow the race
no farther, for as I write a needle pierces me, and I feel as nervous
as though 'I saw the whole stres an struggle raging before my eyes.
AND the memories of delightful friendships, of toil endured to—
gether, of victories gloriously celebrated, of defeats manfully endured,
of the little troubles that diversified the monotony of training, the
nicknames of each member of the crew, their little foibles, their
sturdy, honest disbelief in their rivals, their gallant and unquench-
able belief in themselves—all these are to the man who has rowed in
a race a possession for ever. Qf this no length of years can rob him;
and as he meets his old companions, and fights his old races over again,
he will declare to himself that if he had his fife to live once more he

would be a rowing man rather than tº: else. That is the con-
clusion to which Mr. PITMAN's article brought me. Those who
wish to know what it means to race should read it for themselves.

JOTTINGS AND TITTLINGS.
(By BABoo HURRY BURGsHo JABBERJEE, B.A.)
No. VIII.
How Mr. Jabberjee delivered an Oration at a Ladies' Debating Club.
Miss SPINK (whom I have mentioned supra as a feminine inmate of
Porticobello House) is in additum a member of a Debating Female
Society, which assembles once a week in various private Westbourne
Grove º: for argumentative intercourse.
So, she expressing an anxious desire that I should attend one of
these conclaves, I consented, on ascertaining that I should be afforde
the ; of parading the gab with which I
have been gifted in an extemporised allocution.
On the appointed evening I directed my steps,
under the guidance of the said Miss SPINK, to a
certain imposing stucco residence hard by, wherein
were an assortment of female women conversing
with vivacious garrulity, in a delicious atmosphere
of tea, coffee, and buttered bread.
After having partaken freely of these comesti-
bles, we made the adjournment to a luxuriously
upholstered .." circled with plush-seated
chairs and adorned with countless mirrors, and
there we began to beg the question at issue, to-
whit, “To what extent has Ibsen (if any) contri- (
butedtowards the Causeof Female Emancipation?” &
which was opened by a weedy, tall male gentleman, Y.
with a lofty and a shining forehead, and round,
owlish spectacle-glasses. He read a very volumi-
nous paper, from which I learnt that IBSEN was
the writer of innumerable new-fangled dramas of
very problematical intentions, exposing the hollow
conventionalisms of all established social usages,
especially in the matrimenial department.
en he had ceased there was a universal and
unanimous silence, due to uncontrollable female
bashfulness, for the duration of several minutes,
until the chairwoman ºn tº ºne to have
the courage of her opinions. And the ice being
once fractured, one Amurath succeeded another in
disjointed commentaries, Fluº;ing crows in the
teeth of the assertions of the Hon’ble Opener and
of their precursors, and resumed their seats with
abrupt precipitancy, stating that they had no
further remarks to make.
Then ensued another interim of golden “Silence
and slow Time,” as Poet KEATs says, which was
as if to become Sempiternity, had not I, rushing in
where the angels were in fear of slipping up,
caught the Speaker in the eye, and tipped the
wink of my cacoèthes loquendi.
To prevent disappointment, I shall report my
harangue with verbose accuracy,
Myself (assuming a perpendicular attitude, in-
serting one hand among my vest, buttons, and
waving the other with a graceful affability).
“Hon’BLE MIss CHAIRwoman, MADAMs, Misses,
AND Hon’BLE MISTER OPENER, the humble indi-
vidual now palpitating on his limbs before you is
a denizen from a land whose benighted, ignorant
inhabitants are accustomed to treat the females of
their species_as_small fry and fiddle faddle. Yes,
Madams and Misses, in India the woman is for-
º-
briefest outdoor excursion without
covered palkee, or the hermetically sealed interior of a blinded
carriage. (Cries of ‘Shame.’ In the Zenana, she is restricted to
the occupation of puerile gossipings, or listening to apocryphal fairy
tales, of so scandalising an impropriety that I shrink to pollute my
ears by the repetition even of the tit-bits... (Subdued groans.)
º; the case, you can imagine the astonishment and
gratification I have experienced here this evening at the intelligence
and forw ess manifested by so many effeminate intellects. (A
flattered rustle and prolonged simpering.
“The late respectable Dr. BEN JoHNson, gifted author of Bos-
well's, Biography (applause), once rather humorously remarked,
on, witnessing a nautch performed by canine quadrupeds, that—
although their choreographical abilities were of but a mediocre
nature–the wonderment was that they should be capable at all to
execute such a hind-legged feat and tour de force.
“Similarly, it is to me, a gaping marvel that womanish tongues
should hold forth upon subjects which are naturally far outside the
radius of their comprehensions.

“The subject for our discursiveness to-night is, “To what extent
has Ibsen contributed to the Cause (if an fy Female Emancipa-
tion ?” and being a total ignoramus up to date of the sheer existence
of said hon’ble gentleman, I shall abstain from scratching # head
over so Sphinxian a conundrum, and confine myself to knuckling to
the obiter diction of sundry lady speakers.
“There was a stout full-blown matron, with grey curl-shavings
and a bonnet and plumage, who declaimed her opinionated convic-
tion, that it was degrading and infra dig. for any woman to be
treated as a doll. (Hear, hear.) ell, I would hatch the question-
able egg of a doubt whether any rationalistic masculine could regard
the º: herself in a dollish aspect, and will assure her that in
my fatherland every cultivated native 3. would approach
her with the cold shoulder of apprehensive respect-
fulness. (The bonneted matron becomes ruddier
than the cherry with complacency, and fans her-
self vigorously.
“Next I shall deal with the tall, meagre female
near the fire-hearth, in abbreviated hair and a
nose-pinch, who set up the claim that her sex were
in all essentials the equals, if not the superiors, of
man. Now, without any gairish of words,
proceed, baldly to enumerate various important
physical differentiations which- (Intervention
by Hon’ble Chairwoman, reminding me that these
were not in disputation.) I bow to correction, and
kiss the rod by summing up the gist of my argu-
ment, viz., that it is nonsensical idiotcy to suppose
that a woman can be the equivalent of a man
either in intellectual gripe, in bodily robustious-
ness, or in physical courage. Of the last, I shall
afford an unanswerable proof from my own person.
It is notorious, urbi et orbi, that every feminine
person will flee in iostricken dismay from the
approach of the smallest mouse.
“I am a Bengali, and, as such, profusely en:
dowed with the fugacious instinct, and yet, shall
I quake in appalling consternation if a mouse is to
invademy ſº
“Certainly I shall not; and why: Because,
though not racially a temerarious, I nevertheless
appertain, to the masculine sex, and consequen-
tially my heart is not capable of contracting at the
mere aspect of a rodent. This is not to blow the
triumphant trumpet of sexual superiority, but to
prove a simple undenied fact by dint of an a fortiori.
“Having pulverised my pinched-nose prede-
cessor, I pass on to a speaker of a very very oppo-
site personality—the well-proportioned, beautious
maiden, with azure starry eyes, gilded hair, and
teeth like the seeds of a pomegranate (oh, si sic
omnes /), who vaunted, in the musical accents of a
cuckoo, her right to work out her own life, inde-
pendently of masculine companionship or assist-
ance, and declared that the saccharine element of
courtship and connubiality was but the exploded
mask of man's tyrannical selfishness.
“Had such shocking sentiments been aired by
some of the other lady orators in this room, I must
facetiously have recalled them to a certain fabular
fox which criticised the unattainable grapes as too
immature to merit mastication; but the particular
speaker cannot justly be said to be on all fours
with such an animal. Understand, please, I am no
prejudiced, narrow-minded chap. . would freely

seam; but when I behold a maiden of such excessive pulchritude-
(Second intervention by Hon’ble Chairwoman, desiring me to abstain

that I was not alluding to herself, but since she has spoken in my
wheel with such severity, I will, conclude with my ration on the
subject for debate, namely, the theatrical dramas of Hon'ble IBSEN.
When, Madams and Misses, I make the odious comparison of these
works, with which I am completely unacquainted, to the productions
of Poet SHAKSPEARE, where I may boast the familiarity that is a
breeder of contempt, I find that, in Hamlet's own words, it is the
‘Criterion of a Satire,’ and I shall assert the unaiterable a priori of
my belief that the melodious Swan of Stony Stratford, whether

hese reflections on my sire are chiefly caused by his extraordinary
behaviour on the anniversary of St. Patrick's day. Long as I have
known my parent, and he is a man to be remembered, I have never
seen him so pertinaciously * with perverseness. He came
down to breakfast decorated with an enormous bunch of herbs, which
I at first imagined to be parsley—sans monocle je suis aveugle-then
clover, and finally discovered was a root of shamrock. “This is a
great day indeed, me darlint,” he exclaimed, as he tossed off his
café au lait (this self-combined mixture is the invention of an
ingenious foreigner, whose advertisement you will find on the sixth
page of the *...*.* Gazette).
Still preserving that romantic brogue, which is concomitant, and
necessary to the production of such plays as Arrah-na-pogue, The
Colleen Bawn, and, in these latter days, to a musical stew called
Shamus O'Brien, he invited me to accompany him to an aristo-
cratic assembly at Londonderry House, “where, bedad, m §

was as perfect, as the union of hearts. A. duchess made no more
scruple of exhibiting her homespuns than did a Nationalist lady of

ill in his shamrock disguise, “this a great day for Ould Oireland! }}
For my part, I was busily employed with ready pencil ºf the

stalls. Picture, ETHELINDA, a broad hat of black velvet relieved by
cerise plumes, which would effectually block the view of any stage in
Christendom; imagine a sweet retiring chapeau de paille drooping as
the weeping willow, from which depended garlands of roses, mastur-
tiums, jonquils, and azaleas, treasure and keep in mind the freshness
of a toque formed of hare's ears, with the “brush”, of a fox en
éridence, and the chic of a combination of sarsaparilla leaves and
strawberries. And the dresses? Darling, they were there, but
unseen. The cold, drizzling weather had laid its stern hand on the
extraordinary display, which might reasonably have been expected,
But la belle dame sans merci (how I love KEATs l) had requisitioned
every animal from the beaver to the mole, from the bear to the Arctic
fox, which, fur will, of course, become very reasonable when Dr.
NANSEN returns to civilization. I was really quite overcome by the
spectacle. Papa was so overjoyed with the reception with which
he met that he disappeared, and did not come home till Wednesday
afternoon, when I found a pair of skates, marked “National
Skating Palace,” in his overcoat pocket. He says that he subse-
quently attended a meeting of the Royal ..º. Society.

three pounded capsicums, add half-an-ounce Cayenne pepper,

experience is vast. Ever, dear, Your loving cousin, KADJ.

(Advance Sheets of an Article ripe for use in 1898.)
IT was scarcely to be supposed that after Mr. RICHARDs, M.P.,
had received for an answer to his question in March, 1896, anent the
legality of dramatic sketches in Hyde Park on the first day of the
week, a reply in the affirmative, that matters would be allowed to
remain in statu quo. As all the world knows, the movement once
recognised as lawful became the rage, and extended from the peram-
bulatingFº: of the streets to the regular actor of the recognised
West-end house. This being so, one of our interviewers thought it
his duty to call upon a representative of the theatres to ascertain the
views of the profession upon a matter of so much importance.

(Very New Version of an old “Vitechapel.” Ballad, discovered in the
Pit of an East-End Theatre.) AIR-"All round my Hat.”
Chorus:—
ALL round her hatshe wears allCovent Garding,
All round her hat, wich it is a precious way,
If anyone should axe her the reason why she
wears it,
She'd tell him—well a somethink as I’d
rayther not say.
1 'Twas :* to my place in the pit that I did
meet her
Oh! I thought she was a monster ba-loon
dropped down from the sky.
And I never see a tile more neaternor *.
and poppies piled wot costers call “up-'igh.”
Oh, the donah she was tall, and her hat was of that kind, too,
And cruel was the way it did hintercept my eye ..
From a ºf of the§: as in course I was inclined to,
But I couldn't dodge that market-cart of hat, not any wy.
For three mortal hours I dodged, and squirmed, and started,
For three long mortal hours, as in course I had to stay.
Bad luck to the chap, most merligious and black-hearted,
As invented lydies' hats like a blessed stack of hay.
There is some young women as is soprecious bumptious,
They want four times as much free room as that for wot they pay.
I sez “Can't see a bit o' that play, as I am told is scrumptious,
Along o' that confounded hat a-bobbin' in my way.”
Oh, she guy me such a rattlesnake look out of her eyes, I startedl
She sez, sez she, “I ain't no statue, and hats is wore this way!”
I was awful sorry that my two bob for a seat in that pit I’d parted;
And while these haystack-hats. is wore, not another half-dollar
I'll pay!
Chorus:—
All round my hat I wears a green willow,
All round my hat, in a weeping sort o' way,
And if anyone should axe me the reason wy I wears it
edºme of that play!
'Tis cos o' that Tower o' Babel Hat as bi
CONDENSED CONFIDENCE.
(For Ladies only.)
DEAREST ETHELINDA, -Since my escapade at the Eldorado
Theatre of Varieties, I have lived the existence of a nun. , Quite
otherwise, has been the conduct of Papa. Every night does he sally
forth to his club, and returns like a genuine Member ºf Parlia-
ment in the small, wee hours. “S. jeunesse savatt, si vieillesse
ouvait,”.I, overheard him exclaim yesterday morning, as he hurled
s very tight, varnished boots at the wall opposite to his bedroom
door. I know nothing of the capabilities of jeunesse, but I am well
aware, that pieillesse knocked about half a yard of paper off the
opposition to his strength.
hese reflections on my sire are chiefly caused by his extraordinary
behaviour on the anniversary of St. Patrick's day. Long as I have
known my parent, and he is a man to be remem I have never
seen him so pertinaciously pregnant with perverseness. He came
down to breakfast decorated with an enormous bunch of herbs, which
I at first imagined to be parsley—sans monocle je suis are gº-then
clover, and finally discovered was a root of shamrock. “This is a
great day indeed, me darlint,” he exclaimed, as he tossed off his
café au lait (this self-combined mixture is the invention of an
ingenious foreigner, whose advertisement you will find on the sixth
page of the *...*::::" Gazette).
Still preserving that romantic brogue, which is concomitant, and
necessary to the production of such plays as Arrah-na-pogue, The
Colleen Bawn, and, in these latter days, to a musical stew called
Shamus O'Brien, he invited me to accompany him to an aristo-
cratic assembly at Londonderry House, “where, bedad, my girl,
ou’ll find the foinest gurls in all fondon"doin'their mighty
or the distrestful country.” It is, perhaps, needless to say, mamie,
st Itha
with him to the noble mansion in question. The mise en scène
was as perfect, as the union of hearts. A. duchess made no more
scruple of exhibiting her homespuns than did a Nationalist lady of
; the unrivalled quality of her linen. “Begorral” cried my #:
still in his shamrock disguise, “this a great day for Ould Oireland!'
For my part, I was busily employed with ready pencil noting the
exquisite.coiffures which so constantly prevented my view of the
stalls. Picture, ETHELINDA, a broad hat of black velvet relieved b
cerise plumes, which would effectually block the view of any stage in
Christendom; imagine a sweet retiring chapeau de paille drooping as
the weeping willow, from which depended garlands of roses, mastur-
tiums, jonquils, and azaleas, treasure and keep in mind the freshness
of a toque formed of hare's ears, with the “brush” of a fox en
éridence, and the chic of a combination of sarsaparilla leaves and
strawberries. And the dresses?, Darling, they were there, but
unseen. The cold, drizzling weather had laid its stern hand on the
extraordinary display, which might reasonably have been expected,
But labelle dame sans merci (how I love KEATs!) had requisitioned
every animal from the beaver to the mole, from the bear to the Arctic
fox, which, fur will, of course, become very reasonable when Dr.
NANSEN returns to civilization. I was really quite overcome by the
spectacle. Papa was so overjoyed with the reception with which
he met that he disappeared, and did not come home till Wednesday
afternoon, when I found a pair of skates, marked “National
Skating Palace,” in his overcoat pecket. He says that he subse-
quently attended a meeting of the Royal ..º. Society.
Try this *:::::::" Rub an ounce o und ginger on
three pounded capsicums, add half-an-ounce o º: pepper,
season with pure Cognac (I have the address of the best providers),
and qualify with a gill of peppermint. Papa declares that he has
never been the same man since he consumed this potion, and his
experience is vast. Ever, dear, Your loving cousin, KADJ.
THE HYDE PARK THEATRE.
(Advance Sheets of an Article ripe for use in 1898.)
It was scarcely to be supposed that after Mr. RICHARDs, M.P.,
had received for an answer to his question in March, 1896, anent the
legality of dramatic sketches in Hyde Park on the first day of the
week, a reply in the affirmative, that matters would be allowed to
remain in statu quo. . As all the world knows, the movement once
recognised as lawful became therage, and extended from the peram-
bulatingFº: of the streets to the regular actor of the recognised
West-end house. This being so, one of qur interviewers thought it
his duty to call upon a representative of the theatres to ascertain the
views of the profession upon a matter of so much importance.
“Personally, I have no objection to al fresco performances,” said
the Representative;, “although I believe that finer effects may be
obtained in the play-house than in the Park.”
:Will you kindly make your meaning plainer.”
“Well, you see #. and shade can be more distinctly marked in
an enclosure than in the open air. The actor under cover has the
benefit of the electric light, which can be turned on or off; in the

“Then you consider tragedy thirst-

terviewer. “How do you think the

“From our own s?” put in
the Representative. “Why, that is

LITERARY SCRAPS.
MR. PUNCH, SIR,-As the representative
of English Literature, allow me to address
you. I wish tº suggest to you that the novels
and plays of to-day are far easier of con-
struction than those written in the earlier
}. ars of the century. Nowadays something is
eft to the imagination. To make my meaning
plainer, I will imagine that the careers of
Edwin and ANGELINA have becomehopelessly
involved. The first is married to someone
else, and the second is betrothed to a person
he hates. In the days of old the writer
would have cleared off the superfluous wife
and disposed of the unnecessary fiancé. But
in 1896 such a task is superfluous. All that
the novelist has to do is to ſet down some-
thing like the foll wing:—
CoNCLUSION OF A MoDERN Novel
“This is my wife,” said Edwin, at length.
He was weary of continuing the deception.
“And this is my fiancé;" and ANGELINA
turred red and white, and trembled.
“It is a great mistake,” he murmured; “a
great mistake!”
“You are right,” she repli
tone telling of anguish. “You are always
right. And you were never so right as now.”
And then they both looked out of the window.

further ed, adopting a
out of the window” is quite enough. The reader can supply the remainder at his
or her discretion. -
Then take the play. Thirty or forty
ycars ago a “social problem,” when in-
troduced, had to be solved. Wirtue had to
be triumphant and vice vanquished in the
final act. But nowadays this sºrt of ending
is quite out of date. Suppose that two men
are face to face prepared to fight a duel. The
lady of both their loves is on the stage, and
so is her guardian. Then the author may
give the following:—
END OF A MoDERN PLAY.

the well-informed reader will pro-

close resemblance which, in many
respects, Mr. ORLANDo BATEMAN,
the organist in “Lady Ellenor's
Romance,” bears to Svengali of
Trilby fame. “He was lividly
pale, lean, not very tall, with a
shock of black hair, and immense
black eves.” “He looked so fierce
and wild,” and “when playing,
he threw back the long, black
hair that was apt, to stray Over
his white forehead.” Isn't this
uncommonly like Mr. BEERBoHM
TREE as Spengalif., “I know that
most people call him ugly: but
they have not seen him at work.”
And #: Ellenor, like Trilby,
is Svengalivinised by the aquiline

measure. . Never since, in almost forgotten play, WILson BARRETT
used to raise two lean arms to Heaven, and cry aloud, “How long P
How_long P” has there been seen anything so pathetic as the Stock-
port Man from WHITELEY's lament over this Cattle Bill.

head of the Ministerfor Agriculture, reclining on the Treasury Bench
“I regret that, having been elected to oppose Home Rule, I should
be asked at this early period of the Session to support what I cannot
help calling an English Land League.” -
Observe how, even in the torrential passion of the moment, this
sentence, is carefully shaded. If it had not been so early in the
Sension it wouldn't have been so bad. In July a cup, however bitter
its contents, might be drained, which, proffered in March, is fatal.
Then there is the apologetic introduction of the scathing reference

take over the Water System of the Metropolis. Sixteen years ago the

for the unfettered action of municipal authority over all matters

f that might be, why shouldn't QUILTER carry out his brilliant
idea of packing his petitions in favour of pure beer in a hogshead,
label it,” QuitRR's Entire,” and get KENYon-SLANEY (who will
do anything if promised an opportunity of making a speech) to help
him roll it in P So it was done.
SARK tells me that when Mr. G. went out to the opening of the
Baltic Canal, QUILTER was one of DoN CURRIE’s guests. A Copen-
en paper, printing list of the company, mentioned among the
nobility and gentry, “Sir CUTHBERT QUIETs,” meaning the Member
for Sudbury. Sir CUTHBERT by no means Quiets to-day. This his
great opportunity, and he rose to it. Began at earliest moment.
As soon as vat was trundled into position, leaned his elbow on it,
crossed one leg, and began to discourse about the contents. Six
hundred yards long was the petition; 26,000 signatures it bore; £70
had been subscribed—what for nobody knows. SPEAKER inter-
fered; couldn't have speech at this juncture.
Sir CUTHRERT stood on another leg, and began again, Everybody
had signed the petition, from the bishop on his throne down to—

“So you were the author of that article which stirred up strife
between our country and a nation hitherto well disposed towards
us?” said his parent, sternly,
“I am not ashamed to admit it,” replied the trustee, drawing
himself up to his full height, and looking his father straight in the
eyes with proud humility.

was on the point of revolt?”

“I do not understand vour view of right and wrong,” continued
the old man, sadly. “When you were a child you used to sing
* Rule, Britannia” at your mother's knee.”
“You say truly, father. But in those days, as an infant (I was
considerably under one-and-twenty), I was unable to be a trustee.”
“And has this new dignity entirely changed your nature?”
“No, not entirely. But I feel I must work my utmost for those
whose estate is under my special protection.”
“Then you stir up strife, and do your best to ruin your nation-
to bring your country to the eve of bankruptcy—as a trustee?”
“You put the matter too strongly. I would not absolutely ruin
my country. I would, for instance, not cause a repudiation of the
National Debt. In fact, such a course as that to which I have re-
ferred would be inimical to my interests as a trustee.”

all of which you have accused me, and I will tell you the reason.
Father, I have recently sold out of Consols at 110 on behalf of my
cestus que trust, and I want to bring down the funds-I frankly
admit it—to something under 90 before I reinvest the money.
And now, father—as a trustee-can you blame me?”
But the old man could not reply. He was busily, engaged, in
wiping his eyes on a union-jack handkerchief, and weeping bitterly.

Impeachment stops not the bold traitor's breath,
And restless rowdyism meets not death.
Elizabeth (briskly), Marry cºme up! hath mine illustrious suc-

screw, to take order with traitors and spouters of sedition?
Henry VIII. Verily, yes, my daughter, in effigy, or in rust, at
the Tower, which is now, as we shall hereafter be, a holiday-show

excite themselves about the vulgar vagaries of the modern tag-rag-

George III. Why—why—why, so much the worse, 0 rival and
rebellious George' Short work would they have made with your
monstrous Monroe Doctrine, which even a CECIL now seems too much
disposed to parley and palter with.
Milton. “George did but prompt the age to quit their clogs
By the known rules of ancient liberty.”
Methinks, however, that “CROMwFII, our chief of men,” admitted
in ºffigy, though not-shame on Englishmen l—at Westminster,
would have taught the “Unspeakable Turk” a sterner lesson in
Armenia than the modern CECII finds “diplomatic.”

solemn, how pompous and pragmatical ye all are 1, Atholiday season,

the Holiday Mob, or of that somewhat sardonic person, the British

“eclipse the gaiety of nations.”
Chaucer. “– some men be too curious
In studie, or too melancholius.”
Butlet not this “temple for portreiture” be less lightsome than my
earlier “House of Fame.”
Byron. Right, my cheery “Well of English,” undefiled (though
sometimes, perhaps, a trifle thick and obscure). Emperors and kings
(like most **) are dull dogs, as QUEVEpo, could tell you, and
ALFRED THE LITTLE demonstrate. Whether opening picture
galleries and museums, &c., on Sundays will brighten the lives of
the sons of toil and seduce them from the venal shrines of the vulgar
Bacchus as much as LUBRock and others inlagine, is a question on
which sentimentalists and cynics may, take opposite views. But

tioneers.
(II) An Estate in Asia Minor. —It is
needless to give the exact locality; the im-
portant feature of this property is that
scarcely a day passes without its being sub-
jected to earthquakes of a most violent kind.
The hurricanes, too, are considered by ex-
perts to be absolutely unrivalled. The estate
may be bought outright, or may be rented
from February to June, during which period
the earthquake season is at its height. We
need scarcely point out how desirable a
residence this would be for elderly ladies of
weaknerves, while it is unanimously agreed
that it would be impossible to pass a ºday
there. For the seismologist the locality offers
special advantages, and it would be an excel-
lent home for amateur architects. They
would have the º of designing a new
house for themselves at least once a month.
(III.) Four Acres o

plaint is often made of the , overgrown

the whole of it, the air is beau #: dry,
and the thermometer in the shade (if there
were any) would seldom rise above, 130°.
The spot is, therefore, peculiarly suitable for
invalids. Lions are very plentiful, and there
is the occasional society of certain tribes from
the interior, who display quaint and amusing
cannibalistic tastes. There is no dwelli
place erected at present, but a tent, woul
fully suffice for the occupier, and it could
easily be exchanged, if desired, for the inte-
rior of a lion. The spot has been viewed, and
is strongly recommended by H. RIDER HAG-
GARD, Esq., and H. M. STANLEY, Esq. -
(IV.). An attractive Iceberg (at present) in
the Neighbourhood of Greenland.-An ideal
home for those desiring change of scene, as an
iceberg travels many miles in the summer
season. Charming variety is also afforded by
the fact that its size changes from day today,
and it might even disappear entirely in an
abnormally hot summer. All the valuable
sporting rights—including whale-fishing and
seal-shooting—will pass with the property.
The drainage system is perfect, sea-bathing
may be had (at the cost of a little dyna-
mite), and the whole estate is lighted by the
Aurora borealis. The mail system, which is
garried out by messages enclosed in sealed
bottles, to be ultimately picked up by Esqui-
maux, is slightly irregular; but it is hoped
that a balloon-post may be established before
long. Dr. NANSEN would also probably
arrange for direct voyages on it to the North
Pole for a very moderate fee. -
It will be seen that no finer collection of
properties than the above has been offered to

fident that those who purchase them will be
delighted with their bargains.

THE notorious Intercollegian Boat-race of this anno Domini will
be obsolete and er post facto by the time of publication of the present
instalment of jots and tittles, still I am sufficiently presumptive, to
think that the cogita-
tions and personal ex-
periencesofacultivated,
thoughtful native gen-
tleman on this coerulean
topic may not be found
so stale and dry as the
remainder of a bircuit.
First I will make a
clean bosom with the
confession that, though
ardently desirous to
witness such a Titianic
struggle for the cordon
blew of old Father Antic
the Thames, I was not
the actual spectator of
the affair, being previ-
ously contracted to escort Miss MANKLETow (whose wishfulness is
equivalent to legislation) to a theatrical matutinal performance
which she would in nowise consent to renounce, alleging that she had
already seen the Boat-race to the verge of satiety, and that the
spectacle was instantaneous and paltry.
However, on acquainting my kind and patronising father, Hon’ble
Punch, of my disappointment, he did º: S6, as a pts
aller and blind bargain, a voyage in the steam launchboat of the
official coachman of one of the crews so that I might ascertain how
the trick was done.
And at 10 A.M. on the day of assignation I presented myself at the
riparian premises of a certain Boating Society, and, on exhibiting my
letter of credit to the Mentor or Corypheus aforesaid, was received
d bras ouverts and with an urbane offhandedness.
After I had hung fire and cooled my heels on the banks for awhile,
I was instructed to enter a skiff, which conveyed me and others to a
steamship of very meagre dimensions, whereupon, owing to the heel
of one of my Japan leather shoes becoming implicated in the wire
railing that circumvented the desk, I was embarked in a horizontal
attitude, and severely deteriorated the tall chimneypothat which I
had assumed to do credit to the hon’ble periodical I represented.
(Nota bene. Hatmaker's bill for renovating same, rs, two-and-a-
º those to whom it is of concern will please attend to and
returnoi.
On recovery of my head-gear and equanimity, I stationed myself
in close proximity to the officiating coach for purpose of being on the
threshold of inquiries, and proceeded to pop numerous questions to
my neighbours. I ascertained, among other things, that the vessels
are called “eights,” owing to their containing nine passengers; that
the ninth is called the “cock,” and is a mere supernumerary or
understudent, in case any member of the crew should be overcome by
sickishness during the contest and desire to discontinue.
It appears that the race is of religious and ceremonious origin, for
only “good men” are permitted to compete, and none who is a wine
drunkard, a gluttonous, or addicted to any form of tobacco. More-
over, they are to observe a strict fast and abstinence for many weeks
previous to the ordeal. The most prominent ecclesiastics and Judges
of the Supreme Court are usually chosen from this class of indivi-
duals, which is a further proof of the sanctimoniousness attached to
the competition. -
Consequently I was the more surprised at the disrespectful super-
ciliousness of their Fidus Achates or dry nurse, who, stretching
himself upon his stomach in the prow, did shout counsels of per-
fection at his receding pupils.
Such criticisms as I overheard seemed to me of a very puerile and
captious description, and some of an º personality, e.g., as
when a certainoarman was taunted with being short—as though he
were capable of adding the cubic inch to his stature!
Another I heard advised to keep his visual organs in the interior of
the boat, though, being ordinary optics and not at all of a vitreous
composition, they could not be removable by volition. Again, a third
was reproached because of the lateness with which he had made his
beginning; but, as it was not asserted that he was inferior to the
: theºffin- of his initiation was surely rather honourable than
sºrrace
observed that said trainer did stickle almost prudishly for pro-
why they were forbidden to row with their hands, not being quadru-
manous, and able to employ their feet in such a manner; nor whether,
when he commanded them to “get in at once,” he intended them to
leap into the waters or to return to the landing-place, nor why they
did neither of these things; nor why he should express satisfaction
that a certain rower had got rid of a lofty feather, which would
indubitably have added to the showiness of his appearance.
Again, hearing him anxiously inquire the time after a stoppage, I
was proceeding to explain how gladly I would have given him such
information, but for the unavoidable absence of my golden chrono-
meter, owing to the failure of Misters ToMKINs and Johnson to
restore the same, whereupon he treated me in such a “please-go-
away-and-die” sort of style that I subsided with utmost alacrity.
On the return voyage the Collegiate eight was challenged to a
spurting match by a scratched crew, which appeared to me to be the
superior in velocity, though it seemed it was then too late to make
the happy, exchange.
When the practice was at an end and the Blues in a state of quies-
cence, I intimated my desire to harangue them, and express my
wonderment and admiration at beholding them content to suffer such
hardships and perils and faultfinding without expostulation or
excuses for their shortcomings, and all for no pecuniary recom-
nse, but the evasive reward of a nominis umbra. And I would
ave reminded them of the extended popularity of their performance,
and that it was an unfairness to muzzle the ox that treadeth upon
one's corn, appealing to them to stand up for their rights, and refuse
to compete except for the honorarium of a quid pro quo.
But the official instructor, seeing me about to climb upon the poop,
to deliver my oration; entreated me with so much earnestness to desist
that I became immediately aphonous.
M.P. EMPTY, OR WHAT IT MAY COME TO.
(A Hint from the Bench at the service of Possible Candidates for
Parliament, to be used in the Future.)
[“The expense of this inquiry is really most burdensome. A contested
election is nothing to the expense of an inquiry like this.”—Mr. Baron
Pollock, March, 1896.]
...ALL was joy. The Newly Elected received congratulations on every
side. The months of toil, the #. of rhetoric, had brought their
reward. No more the doubt of pleasing the majority of the con-
stituents. No more the fear of a false step on the chosen platform.
The returning officer had done his work satisfactorily. There had
been no mistake about the counting. The return had been made.
The roll had been signed. The right-hand of the Speaker had been
cordially grasped, and warmly shaken.
It was at this moment that a knock was heard. The sound came
from the street door.
“More, friends with further pleasant, speeches,” murmured the
Newly Elected. “Well, well, it is delightful to know that my
happiness is a source of joy to others.”
But, alas! it was no friend who had entered the sanctum of the
People's Legislator. He was courteous, but distinctly business-like.
In a few moments he made it clear that the object of his visit was to
cast a gloom over the happy dream of the hon, gentleman he was
professionally interviewing.
“A petition!” exclaimed the Newly Elected. “An inquiry!”
The visitor bowed and silently took his departure.
For a moment the People's Legislator was lost in a brown study.
Then he came to a determination. He sat down and wrote a short
letter. He sealed it with a sigh, and handed it to his batter half.
“You are writing to the speaker of the House of Commons. Has
he asked you to a full-dress Parliamentary Dinner?”
The Newly Elected smiled sadly and shook his head, then he mur-
mured, with a voice broken with emotion, “It is better as it is.”
“What is better as it is P” was the question.
Then came the reply.
“That I should retire at once. That I should relinquish my career
as a legislator. That I should cease to be the chosen representative
of the People. Yes, yes, it is wiser that I should accept the Chiltern
Hundreds to save the balance at my bankers than to retain Parlia-
mentary honours at the cost of a conceivable invitation to appear in
Portugal Street!”

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
CHILDREN's Books.
In the New Review for this month Mr. F. ANSTEY discourses plea-
santly on “An Old-fashioned Children's Book,” namely, The Fair-
child Family, written by Mrs. SHERwood, and published so lo
ago as 1818. The Fairchild Family consists of a layer of childis
scrapes and adventures sandwiched between thick slabs of pious
allusions, and spotted, like a currant cake (the simile cannot offend),
with texts. Never were parents so prompt as the Fairchild couple to
improve the most trivial occasion, and never were children so deter-
mined in dragging in the prospect of “hell, the place which burns
for ever with fire and brimstone,” as a punishment for the very least
deviation from the narrow path of correct behaviour.
MR, ANSTEY accounts for the popularity of The Fairchild Family
on several grounds. He is disposed to think that a great, many
children have a natural pathy with priggishness, and that to
others it must have afforded unholy joy to hear of the hot water the
goºd children were constantly getting into. Moreover, as he points
out, “throughout the book various good things to eat are chronicled
with much feelin ,” and there are plenty of funerals and death-bed
scenes, both of which, as is well known, have a curious fascination
for childish or uninstructed minds. These reasons may account for
something, but I think. Mr. ANSTEy, gets nearer tº the real causa
causans ºf the popularity of The Fairchild Family when he says
“there are many incidental stories, all, moral, but none absolutely
uninteresting, and some ingenious and pretty. , And finally, the
story is really well-written in its old-fashioned way, and has a
j. and earnestness that would go far to keep many a worse
ve,
THERE you have it. Incidental stories will help to keep almost
any book popular amongst children. . They enjoy nothing more than
being whisked suddenly off the beaten track of their story into an
entirely new region peopled with, fresh inhabitants. Their little
excursion over, they come back with renewed zest to the old familiar
region, and the accustomed faces of the main plot. , And, above, all
things, good writing, sound, clear, straightforward, and graphic,
but never precious or affected, is essential, if boys or Fº are really
to be interested in a book, They know nothing of the rules of
criticism, and probably as little of the laws of grammar and composi-
tion, but in their own unconscious way they are the soundest of
critics, and an ill-written, ill-constructed book has not the remotest
chance of ever being widely popular amongst children.
PRIgGISHNESs in fiction certainly doesn't disgust children. For
one thing, I am inclined to think that, children never quite reach
that pitch of imagination by which adults convince themselves that
fictitious characters are actual flesh and blood. Children look upon
fiction as a sort of game, and in the main they are content that the
author should set up and clothe his own characters, and make them
talk and act in whatever way seems best to him, even when that way
lies entirely apart from the experience of his little readers. They
want to be interested, and, if the author satisfies them in that
respect, they accept without, a murmur eccentricities which in real
life would frighten or repel them. I never read The History y the
Fairchild Family myself, but I did at a very early age read and
enjoy most thoroughly The Swiss Family Robinson—those immortal,
outrageous, platitudinous prigs. Their priggishness, did not in the
least appal me; if I was conscious of it § I doubt) I accepted it
as part of the convention laid down by the author, and hurried on
breathlessly, to discover how these solitary Swiss sufferers by ship-
wreck would extricate themselves from their innumerable difficulties.
And Sandford and Merton I read with unbounded zest, #.
on account of the incidental stories with which that excellent
is encrusted. I don't think I objected much to Mr. Barlow. He
was not in the least like my own tutor of those early days, a breezy,
hearty, Cambridge man, who first guided my trembling footsteps
through the mazes of Latin Fº and taught me not to stumble
over vulgar fractions; but if there had to be a tutor in Sandford
and Merton, Mr. Barlow, I thought, did as well as anybody else for
the place; and after all it was the author, and not I, who had made
him, I wasn't responsible for him.
ALL attempts to teach children to be good or religious or theologi-
cally dogmatic by means of fiction are foredoomed to failure for the
reasons I have stated. Fiction being *f." to children, it is im-
possible for them, to apply what they r in stories to the serious
purpose of their little lives. All the purposeful goodness or religion
in a story just glides off their backs: if there is a story they enjoy it,
and, as a matter of fact, they don't trouble their heads for a moment
with religious discussions or conversations about Heaven and the
other place which may have been embroidered into it by the sanguine
but deluded author. So with Gulliver's Travels. SwiFT's master-
piece owes its wonderful and extensive popularity as much to the
interest that º: take in its marvels as to any delight...ex-
perienced by their elders in its biting satire. Even the Big-endians
are accepted as part of the convention, and no boy that I ever heard
of troubles to º the moral to politics—even if he knows what
olitics mean. It is a fine piece of satire in itself that the gloomy
ean's highest effort in satire should have afforded simple delight to
generation after generation of young folk incapable of satire.
I HARDLY know what boys most care to read nowadays. A little
fellow of ten, who is now staying with me, is deep in The Prisoner
of Zenda, having lately finished Huckleberry Finn. In a day or two
he intends to tackle Battles of the Nineteenth Century—a grand
book for boys, lately published by Messrs. CASSELL. Do boys still
read MARRYAt? Never can I forget the early joys of Peter Simple and
Midshipman Easy, the gloomy but fascinating terrors of The Dog-
Fiend, and the haunting mystery of The Phantom Ship. I read
them all again, and with a delight, not a year ago. BALLAN-
TYNE, too, was a friend of my boyhood, as HENTY is a friend to the
young generation of to-day, which reminds me that every work by
Mr. HENTY is on the shelves of the small friend of whom I have
spoken. Little boys, I think, are neither prigs nor lovers of priggish-
Iless, . like a gallant, breezy heroism, undaunted by dangers,
and unscathed in the midst of the thunderbolts of war. About little
girls I am not so sure. Quite early in their lives they pass through
a preternaturally serious phase, when, weighted with innumerable
dolls, they assume the responsibilities and the airs of motherhood,
and are apt to rebuke little brothers for naughtiness. . Yes, I think
; girls are sometimes priglets—darling, but still undeniable, little
priglets,

be obsolete and er post facto by the time of publication of the present
instalment of jots and tittles, still I am sufficiently presumptive, to
think that the cogita-
tions and personal ex-
periencesofacultivated,
thoughtful native gen-
tleman on this coerulean
topic may not be found
so stale and dry as the
remainder of a bircuit.
First I will make a
clean bosom with the
confession that, though
ardently desirous to
witness such a Titianic
struggle for the cordon
blew of old Father Antic
the Thames, I was not
the actual spectator of
the affair, being previ-
ously contracted to escort Miss MANKLETow (whose wishfulness is
uivalent to legislation) to a theatrical matutinal performance
which she would in nowise consent to renounce, alleging that she had
already seen the Boat-race to the verge of satiety, and that the
spectacle was instantaneous and paltry. - -
However, on acquainting my kind and patronising father, Hon’ble
Punch, of my disappointment, he did benevolentl . as a pts
aller and blind bargain, a voyage in the steam launchboat of the
official coachman of one of the crews so that I might ascertain how
the trick was done.
And at 10 A.M. on the day of assignation I presented myself at the
riparian premises of a certain Boating Society, and, on exhibiting my
letter of credit to the Mentor or Corypheus aforesaid, was received
d bras ouverts and with an urbane offhandedness.
After I had hung fire and cooled my heels on the banks for a while,
I was instructed to enter a skiff, which conveyed me and others to a
steamship of very meagre dimensions, whereupon, owing to the heel
of one of my Japan leather shoes becoming implicated in the wire
railing that circumvented the desk, I was embarked in a horizontal
attitude, and severely deteriorated the tall chimneypot hat which I
had assumed to do credit to the hon’ble periodical I represented.
(Nota bene. Hatmaker's bill for renovating, same, rs. two-and-a-
º those to whom it is of concern will please attend to and
remunol.
On recovery of my head-gear and equanimity, I stationed myself
in close proximity to the officiating coach for purpose of being on the
threshold of inquiries, and proceeded to pop numerous questions to
my neighbours. I ascertained, among other things, that the vessels
are called “eights,” owing to their containing nine passengers; that
the ninth is called the “cock,” and is a mere supernumerary or
understudent, in case any member of the crew should be overcome by
sickishness during the contest and desire to discontinue.
It appears that the race is of religious and ceremonious origin, for
only “good men” are permitted to compete, and none who is a wine
drunkard, a gluttonous, or addicted to any form of tobacco. More-
over, they are to observe a strict fast and abstinence for many weeks
previous to the ordeal. The most prominent ecclesiastics and Judges
of the Supreme Court are usually chosen from this class of indivi-
duals, which is a further proof of the sanctimoniousness attached to
the competition. -
Consequently I was the more surprised at the disrespectful super-
ciliousness of their Fidus Achates or dry nurse, who, stretching
himself upon his stomach in the prow, did shout counsels of per-
fection at his receding pupils.
Such criticisms as I overheard seemed to me of a very puerile and
captious description, and some of an *..." personality, e.g., as
when a certainoarman was taunted with being short—as though he
were capable of adding the cubic inch to his stature!
Another I heard advised to keep his visual organs in the interior of
the boat, though, being ordinary optics and not at all of a vitreous
composition, they could not be removable by volition. Again, a third
was reproached because of the lateness with which he had made his
beginning; but, as it was not asserted that he was inferior to the
: theºffin- of his initiation was surely rather honourable than
sºrrade
observed that said trainer did stickle almost prudishly for pro-
were attired, and entreating them to keep their buttons well up,
though indeed, I could discern none, nor was there much which was
humanly possible to be buttoned.
For myself, I must make the humble complaint that the Hon’ble
Cºach was defective in courteous attention to my inquisitiveness,
which he totally ignored. For I could not prevaiſ upon him to ex-
plain what thing it was that he directed the oarmen to “wait for,”
to “ º at from a stretcher,” and “catch at the beginning”; nor
why they were forbidden to row with their hands, not being quadru-
manous, and able to employ their feet in such a manner; nor whether,
when he commanded them to “get in at once,” he intended them to
leap into the waters or to return to the landing-place, nor why they
did neither of these things; nor why he should express satisfaction
that, a, certain rower had got rid of a lofty feather, which would
indubitably have added to the showiness of his appearance.
Again, hearing him anxiously inquire the time after a stoppage, I
was proceeding to explain how gladly I would have given him such
information, but for the, unavoidable absence of my golden chrono-
meter, owing to the failure of Misters ToMKINs and Johnson to
restore the same, whereupon, he treated me in such a “please-go-
away-and-die” sort of style that I subsided with utmost alacrity.
On the return voyage the Collegiate eight was challenged to a
spurting match by a scratched crew, which appeared to me to be the
superior in velocity, though it seemed it was then too late to make
the happy, exchange.
When the practice was at an end and the Blues in a state of quies-
cence, I intimated my desire to harangue them and express my
wonderment and admiration at beholding them content to suffer such
hardships and perils and faultfinding without expostulation or
excuses for their shortcomings, and all for no pecuniary recom-
nse, but the evasive reward of a nominis, umbra. And I would
ave reminded them of the extended popularity of their performance,
and that it was an unfairness to muzzle the ox that treadeth upon
one's corn, appealing to them to stand up for their rights, and refuse
to compete except for the honorarium of a quid pro quo.
But the official instructor, seeing me about to climb upon the poop,
to deliver my oration; entreated me with so much earnestness to desist
that I became immediately aphonous.
M.P. EMPTY, OR WHAT IT MAY COME TO.

Parliament, to be used in the Future.)
[“The expense of this inquiry is really most burdensome. A contested
election is nothing to the expense of an inquiry like this.”—Mr. Baron
Pollock, March, 1896.]
. ALL was joy. The Newly Elected received congratulations on every
side. The months of toil, the years of rhetoric, had brought their
reward. No more the doubt of pleasing the majority of the con-
stituents. No more the fear of a false step on the chosen platform.
The returning officer had done his work satisfactorily. There had
been no mistake about the counting. The return had been made.
The roll had been signed. The right-hand of the Speaker had been
cordially grasped, and warmly shaken.
It was at this moment that a knock was heard. The sound came
from the street door.
“More, friends with further pleasant, speeches,” murmured the
Newly Elected. “Well, well, it is delightful to know that my
happiness is a source of joy to others.”
But, alas! it was no friend who had entered the sanctum of the
People's Legislator. He was courteous, but distinctly business-like.
In a few moments he made it clear that the object of his visit was to
cast a gloom over the happy dream of the hon, gentleman he was
professionally interviewing.
*A petition!” exclaimed the Newly Elected. “An inquiry!”
The visitor bowed and silently took his departure,
For a moment the People's Legislator was lost in a brown study.
Then he came to a determination. He sat down and wrote a short
letter. He sealed it with a sigh, and handed it to his better half.
“You are writing to the speaker of the House of Commons. Has
he asked you to a full-dress Parliamentary Dinner?”
The Newly Elected smiled sadly and shook his head, then he mur-
mured, with a voice broken with emotion, “It is better as it is.”
“What is better as it is ?” was the question.
Then came the reply.
“That I should retire at once. That I should relinquish my career
as a legislator. That I should cease to be the chosen representative
of the People. Yes, yes, it is wiser that I should accept the Chiltern
Hundreds to save the balance at my bankers than to retain Parlia-
mentary honours at the cost of a conceivable invitation to appear in
Portugal Street!”

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
CHILDREN's Books.
In the New Review for this month Mr. F. ANSTEY discourses plea-
santly on “An Old-fashioned Children's Book,” namely, The Fair-
child Family, written by Mrs. SHERwood, and published so long
ago as 1818. The Fairchild Family consists of a layer of childish
scrapes and adventures sandwiched between thick slabs of pious
allusions, and spotted, like a currant cake (the simile cannot offend),
with texts. Never were parents so prompt as the Fairchild couple to
improve the most trivial occasion, and never were children so deter-
mined in dragging in the prospect of “hell, the place which burns
for ever with fire and brimstone,” as a punishment for the very least
deviation from the narrow path of correct behaviour.
MR, ANSTEY accounts for the popularity of The Fairchild Family
on several grounds. He is disposed to think that a great, many
children have a natural ..". with priggishness, and that to
others it must have afforded unholy joy to hear of the hot water the
goºd children were constantly getting into. Moreover, as he points
out, “throughout the book various good things to eat are chronicled
with much feeling,” and there are plenty of funerals and death-bed
scenes, both of which, as is well known, have a curious fascination
for childish or uninstructed minds. These reasons may account for
something, but I think. Mr. ANSTEy, gets nearer to the real causa
Causans ºf the popularity of The Fairchild Family when he says
“there are many incidental stories, all moral, but none absolutely
uninteresting, and, some ingenious and pretty. , And finally, the
story is really well-written in its old-fashioned way, and has a
jº. and earnestness that would go far to keep many a worse
We,
THERE you have it. Incidental stories will help to keep almost
any book popular amongst children. . They enjoy nothing more than
being whisked suddenly off the beaten track of their story into an
entirely new region peopled with, fresh inhabitants. Their little
excursion over, they come back with renewed zest to the old familiar
region, and the accustomed faces of the main plot. , And, above, all
things, good writing, sound, clear, straightforward, and graphic,
but never precious or affected, is essential, if boys or girls are really
to be interested in a book, They know nothing of the rules of
criticism, and probably as little of the laws of grammar and composi-
tion, but in their own unconscious way they are the soundest of
critics, and an ill-written, ill-constructed book has not the remotest
chance of ever being widely popular amongst children.
PRIgGISHNESs in fiction certainly doesn't disgust children. For
one thing, I am inclined to think that, children never quite reach
that pitch of imagination by which adults, convince themselves that
fictitious characters are actual flesh and blood. Children look upon
fiction as a sort of game, and in the main they are content that the
author should set up and clothe his own characters, and make them
talk and act in whatever way seems best to him, even when that way
lies entirely apart from the experience of his little readers. They
want to be interested, and, if the author satisfies them in that
respect, they accept without a murmur eccentricities which in real
life would frighten or repel them. I never read The History of the
Fairchild Family myself, but I did at a very early age read and
enjoy most thoroughly The Swiss Family Robinson—those immortal,
outrageous, platitudinous prigs. Their priggishness, did not in the
least appal me; if I was conscious of it (which I doubt) I accepted it
as part of the convention laid down by the author, and hurried on
breathlessly to discover how these solitary Swiss sufferers by ship-
wreck would extricate themselves from their innumerable difficulties.
And Sandford and Merton I read with unbounded zest, #.
on account of the incidental stories with which that excellent
is encrusted. I don't think I objected much to Mr. Barlow. He
was not in the least like my own tutor of those early days, a breezy,
hearty Cambridge man, who first guided my trembling footsteps
through the mazes of Latin grammar and taught me not to stumble
over vulgar fractions; but if there had to be a tutor in Sandford
and Merton, Mr. Barlow, I thought, did as well as anybody else for
the place; and after all it was the author, and not I, who had made
him. I wasn't responsible for him.
ALL attempts to teach children to be good or religious or theologi-
cally dogmatic by means of fiction are foredoomed to failure for the
reasons I have stated. Fiction being a f* to children, it is im-
possible for them to apply what they read in stories to the serious
purpose of their little lives. All the purposeful goodness or religion
in a story just glides off their backs: if there is a story they enjoy it,
and, as a matter of fact, they don't trouble their heads for a moment
with religious discussions or conversations about. Heaven and the
other place which may have been embroidered into it by the sanguine
but deluded author. So with Gulliver's Travels. Swift's master-
piece owes its wonderful and extensive popularity as much to the
interest that youngsters take in its marvels as to any delight ex-
perienced by their elders in its biting satire. Even the Big-endians
are accepted as part of the convention, and no boy that I ever heard
of troubles to º the moral to politics—even if he knows what
olitics mean. It is a fine piece of satire in itself that the gloomy
ean’s highest effort in satire should have afforded simple delight to
generation after generation of young folk incapable of satire.
I HARDLY know what boys most care to read nowadays. A little
fellow of ten, who is now staying with me, is deep in The Prisoner
of Zenda, having lately finished Huckleberry Finn. In a day or two
he intends to tackle Battles of the Nineteenth Century-a grand
book for boys, lately published by Messrs. CASSELL. Do boys still
read MARRYAt? Never can I forget the early joys of Peter Simple and
Midshipman Easy, the gloomy but fascinating terrors of The Dog:
Fiend, and the haunting mystery of The Phantom Ship. I read
them all again, and with a fresh delight, not a year ago. BALLAN-
TYNE, too, was a friend of my boyhood, as HENTY is a friend to the
young generation of to-day, which reminds me that every work by
Mr. HENTY is on the shelves of the small friend of whom I have
spoken. Little boys, I think, are neither prigs nor lovers of priggish-
ness. They like a gallant, breezy heroism, undaunted by dangers,
and unscathed in the midst of the thunderbolts of war. About little
girls I am not so sure. Quite early in their lives they pass through
a preternaturally serious phase, when, weighted with innumerable
dolls, they assume the responsibilities and the airs of motherhood,
and are apt to rebuke little brothers for naughtiness. , Yes, I think
; girls are sometimes priglets—darling, but still undeniable, little
priglets.

Unwilling To give Up HoRsks ALTogº.THER, CAPTAIN PRLHAM EFFECTED A compromise,
CREATED QUITE A SENSATION.
His FIRST APPEARANCE IN THE PARK
OWED TO THE MOON.
“0 sweak not by the moon, the inconstant moon!” said poor love-
sick Juliet. echoing blindly the anti-lunar prejudices of poets and other
lunatics. The moon is nowavenged. Mr. CLEMENTs, the great weather-
prophet, does swear by the moon... ln his earlier attempts at vaticina-
tion he was thrown out, owing to “neglecting the moon.” Lunatook
her revenge by throwing out” his calculations. Now Mr. CLEMENTs
has conciliated the moon by “making a study of her”; and she has
done for him, what neither the sun or the planets would or could do,
namely, enabled him to foretell the weather for long years ahead,
'...within say eight or ten per cent, of correctness.” To be sure slight
discrepancies and delay, “due to the overlapping of the corresponding
day of the past with the predicted day,” may occasionally occur, and
upset the practical arrangements based upon moon-guided prog-
nostications. But what of that? If CLEMENTs—and the moon-
prophesy that it will be fine to-morrow (when you are going to be
married) and it is not fine until the next dav, owing simply to
“surface discrepancies,” you needn't blame the Barry Road seer and
his familiar satellite for so slight an error as that. It will be fine,
sooner or later, and, if a weather-prophet's prophecy is ultimately
ed, why quibble about a “discrepancy” of twelve hours, or
even twenty-four P What is eight—or even ten—per cent, of error in
such epoch-making estimates as those of Mr. CLEMENTs and the moon?
0, swear not at the moon, the inconstant moon,
Who to our prophet is a blessed boon
For she, and Mr. CLEMENTs linked together,
Will tell you all about forthcoming weather.
She “monthly changes in her circled orb,”
But let the study of her ways absorb
You, as it does the seer of Barry Road,
And a new Ode to Luna will be owed.
For, like a ºpºrting tipster, she, no doubt,
Will prove “upon the spot”—or thereabout.
Just trust to her and Mr. C. together,
And you may always hope for CLEMENT(s) weather
MoTTo For DESTITUTE ALIENS.–"Give me neither poverty nor
LIGHT IN EGYPTIAN DARKNESS.
(Extracted from the Chamberlais Sphinz.)
OUR policy’s dark, do you venture to say?
You cannot perceive what we mean? ...
ell, you must be aware that the new RöNTGEN ray
Is light—though it cannot be seen ' -
And so with our plan on the banks of the Nile,
Which is—let us say—our “a ray.” -
You just wait a bit—you will find it worth whºle-
The result will be clear as the day.
A tentative thing is our Soudan advance,
But if it should meet with defeat
(At the hands of the Rads, or the Mahdi, or France),
We can then try—a sudden retreat!

servation Society. Why not a Lords Preservation Society P. There
may be one, for aught I know, but I live away in the country, and
conserve myself to myself. Yours,

QUITE THE APPROPRIATE PLACE.-It is proposed to start “A
Smack Boys' Home” at Birchington. Excellent 1 Gratifying to
the shade of “Ingoldsby.” But whither shall the smack boys go
for their “whackation”?
Paradoxical.
IT does, indeed, seem singularly strange
That people pertinaciously prating
Aº Board Schools are anxious to arrange -
at all schools now should be exempt from “rating.”
REMARKABLE Dom Esticity of THE “INCANDEscENT LIGHT.”-
It is very steady. It never goes out.

'aving a bran-new rig-out,
And my winter “Immensikoff” now can with
safety be put up the spout.

Oh, lor! wot a comfort it is to 'ave things

Not like I do now, dear old man; but since

all the delights of a pub,<-
And I thinks of that Hundred and Fifty as
follows dear ARTHUR and Joe,
Till wot with Spring feelings and Scotch, I
declare I fºil of a glow.
In the Spring-as some poet remarks-young
men's fancies do seem on the turn -
To love and to general lumminess. Senti-
ment’s slop as I spurn,
But somehow the lime-leaves and laylocks,
laburnums and purple-topped flags,
Stirs somethink within me as means a day off
and a new pair o' bags.
My boss 'as no poetry in 'im, wus luck, and
my tailor's the same.
But Easter comes most aprypo to a chap as

Bosses can't do away with Cross Bun Day-

From Thursday to Tuesday, is yum-yum,

I mounted my bike this last 'oliday. Tell

When I fling my leg over the saddle and
treadle away tords the sea.
The bike, mate, like cigarette-smoking, is
levelling class, ah! and sex.
When Princesses pedal, , and Hempresses
whiff, there are prigs it may vex;
But biking and bacca, like love, are per-
miskus, and don't dror no line;
And the Duchess FUMFUDGE on 'er wheel

I know lots o' littery parties now freeze on

And, now bikes, a reglar fair buster. 'E

With 'is'appy fat smile, and fine calves, and

As my pocket won't run to, dear boy, 'e's

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Up till now I thought that the patent for
writing genuinely stirring romance, such as
the ant Knight of the Brush, Sir John
GILBERT, would love to illustrate, had been
acquired by Messrs. “Q,” HAGGARD, HALL
CAINE, ANTHONY HoPE, FRANK BARRETT &
Qo., Limited, but now I find an opposition
firm started by A. E. W. MAson, whose
Courtship of Morrice Buckler, published
by MACMILLAN & Co., is a most fascinating
story of this class. Not only is it full of plot
and counterplot, not only is its hero as
original as any, recently invented hero can
possibly be, but there is a closely, woven
thread of details, every one of which is abso-
lutely essential to the artistic design. So in
the construction, though there be clouds of
dust raised, yet is there no one figure in the
tourbillon that does not fill its place of set
purpose; and in the i. no scrap of
conversation without its definite object, nor,
in the action, is there a single movement
without its proper destination. The motive
of the hero is, in one sense, of the noblest
kind, insomuch that it represents the spec-
tacle of the highest form of manly devotion,
namely, risking life for the purpose of re-
venging the death of a friend, and so punish-
ing one who had been to all intents and pur-
poses a cowardly assassin. There is one cir-
cumstance, an initial one, which, had the
author taken advantage of his own inge-
nuity, would have intensified the interest
throughout in a most remarkable manner.
This will remain the Baron's secret, which,
as title (The Baron's Secret, is it not a good

traries” possible, register and appropriate to

for a brief span on this e and then is
heardnomore. Yet on Julian's last moments
depends the whole sequence of events. Per-
haps the curiosity of my readers will
aroused by this inuendo. Be this as it may
if this º hint will increase the number o
readers, they will, unless gratitudebe extinct,
thank me for my strong recommendation as to
the excellent entertainment provided for them
in The Courtship of Morrice Buckler.
If H. G. WELLs, whilst writing The Island
of Dr. Moreau, had only preserved the
courage of his original idea, he might have
produced a romance 2nt-Hºggarding HAG-

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
UP till now I thought that the patent for
writing genuinely stirring romance, such as
the ant Knight of the Brush, Sir John
GILBERT, would love to illustrate, had been
acquired by Messrs. “Q,” HAGGARD, HALL
CAINE, ANTHONY HoPE, FRANK BARRETT &
Co., Limited, but now I find an opposition
firm started by A. E. W. MAson, whose
Courtship of Morrice Buckler, published
by MACMILLAN & Co., is a most fascinating
story of this class. Not only is it full of plot
and counterplot, not only is its hero as
original as any recently invented hero can
possibly be, but there is a closely woven
thread of details, every one of which is abso-
lutely essential to the artistic design. So in
the construction, though there be clouds of
dust raised, yet is there no one figure in the
tourbillon that does not fill its place of set
purpose; and in the dialogue, no scrap of
conversation without its definite object, nor,
in the action, is there a single movement
without its proper destination... The motive
of the hero is, in one sense, of the noblest
kind, insomuch that it represents the spec-
tacle of the highest form of manly devotion,
namely, risking life for the purpose of re-
yenging the death of a friend, and so punish-
ing one who had been to all intents and pur-
poses a cowardly assassin. There is one cir-
cumstance, an initial one, which, had the
author taken advantage of his own inge-
nuity, would have intensified the interest
throughout in a most remarkable manner.
This will remain the Baron's secret, which,
as title (The Baron's Secret, is it not a good

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
UP till now I thought that the patent for
writing genuinely stirring romance, such as
the gallant Knight of the Brush, Sir John
GILBERT, would love to illustrate, had been
acquired by Messrs. “Q,” HAGGARD, HALL
CAINE, ANTHONY HoPE, FRANK BARRETT &
Co., Limited, but now I find an opposition
firm started by A. E. W. MAson, whose
Courtship of Morrice Buckler, published
by MACMILLAN & Co., is a most fascinating
story of this class. Not only is it full of plot
and counterplot, not only is its hero as
original as any recently invented hero can
possibly be, but there is a closely woven
thread of details, every one of which is abso-
lutely essential to the artistic design. So in
the construction, though there be clouds of
dust raised, yet is there no one figure in the
tourbillon that does not fill its place of set
purpose; and in the i. no scrap of
conversation without its definite object, nor,
in the action, is there a single movement
without its proper destination... The motive
of the hero is, in one sense, of the noblest
ind, insomuch that it represents the spec-
tacle of the highest form of manly devotion,
namely, risking life for the purpose of re-
yenging the death of a friend, and so punish-
ing one who had been to all intents and pur-
poses a cowardly assassin. There is one cir-
cumstance, an initial one, which, had the
author taken advantage of his own inge-
nuity, would have intensified the interest
throughout in a most remarkable manner.
This will remain the Baron's secret, which,
as title (The Baron's Secret, is it not a good
one F), the present scribe doth “herewith,”
and “hereby,” with all the “neverthelesses,”
“notwithstandings,” and “all-to-the-con-
traries” possible, register and appropriate to
Small Voice from under the Bed, "No, I will wor come out I
ºxº
I TELL YOU, ONCE AND
FoR ALL, BERNESIA, I WILL BE MASTER IN My own House !"
the brave but ill-fated Julian, who appears
for a brief span on this e and then is
heard no more. Yet on Julian's last moments
depends the whole sequence of events...Per-
haps the curiosity of my readers will be
aroused by this inuendo. Be this as it may
if this my hint will increase the number o
readers, they will, unless gratitudebeextinct,
thank me for my strong recommendation as to
the excellent entertainment provided for them
in The Courtship of Morrice Buckler.
If H. G. WELLs, whilst writing The Island
of Dr. Moreau, had only preserved the
courage of his original idea, he might have
produced a romance ºut-Hºggarding, Hº,
GARD, and relegating Zanoni and the "Wril”
eople to keep company with Lemuel Gul-
}: Ferdinand Count Fathom, and Co.,
in the shades of the Almost Forgotten Ones.
But after fº through two-thirds of his
uncanny tale, the author, apparently satisfied
be only attributed to a training course of
heavy suppers and a superficial study of
anatomical subjects, resulting in dream-fits
of violent indigestion, became frightened by
his own monsters, and thought his course
would be to announce to his readers that he
had “only been purtendin’ all along,” and
that these awful creatures of his imagination
were in .# only intended to represent the
stupidity, se ess, sensuality, and all, the
lower qualities of animal man; and that, in
fact, the whole story, from beginning to end,
was a parable, and not the true record sup-
posed to have been made by the uncle of
Charles Edward Prendrick, and subse-
quently published, for the benefit of society
and science, by his enterprising nephew.
When the author himself shows you “how
it’s done,” there is an end of the mystery,
the interestin the tale is dead, and the author
in giving hi away causes the reader to



his own partic use. It is an omission
which goes near to spoiling the character of
regret, ever having taken him at his own
valuation. THE BARON.

THAT GAME OF GOLF.—I.
PoEFLEs said I must learn golf,
life was not worth living without
golf; my liver was sluggish, ac-
cording to PoEFLEs, I was alto-
gether too fat, and, in fact,
nothing but a course of golf
would cure it.
One fine day, when we had
been discussing the matter for
the fiftieth time, and I had ex-
hausted my entire stock of argu-
ments against PoEFLEs's ºº::
I feebly remarked that you
gouldn't play golf without
“sticks,” and as I hadn't any
sticks, that ended the matter
once and for all. PoEFLEs, how-
ever, was not to be so easily
beaten, and that same afternoon,
under some pretence, I was be-
guiled unexpectedly into the
presence of a polite gentleman
whose business it was to provide
players with the necessary
weapons for the l rosecution of
“the ” game. Once inside the
shop, Poffles and his professional
friend proceeded, in spite of all
remonstrances on my part, to
supply me (at my ºwn expense)
with an outfit of “clubs,” as they
called them, to enable me to learn
the game at the shortest possible
notice.
I really can't remember the
names of all the awful instru-
ments I purchased at that shop.
They were all so new and nice
that, after a time, I was quite
interested, swinging the clubs in
the most vicious * to the
manifest disturbance of PoEFLEs,
who nearly got his head broken
with a thing they called a “patent
mid-spoon brassey bulger”! Then
I purchased several “irons” and
“drivers,” two or three “cleeks,”
and a thing called a “mashie” or
“niblick” or something. I did
like that “niblick”—it was a
real powerful club—it reminded
me of a battle-axe, I felt I could
“rely” on it all the time.
Well, after a time PoEFLEs got
†: without the clubs,
which I insisted on taking home
to show my wife, MARIA, and we
arranged to go down to Ranelagh
(PoEFLEs belongs to Ranelagh)
and have a quiet game next day,
Saturday. On returning home, I
practised in, the drawing-room
with the clubs, as PoEFLEs said
I must get into the right
“swing.” That “swing” cer-
tainly turned out e sive, as
during my practice I not only
managed to clear the cabinet of

knickers, and a pair of stockings
with a pattern on them that re-
minded me of BRock's fireworks.
Then his boots were something to
be remembered, and a pair of
yellow spats didn't improve them
at all. Altogether he seemed to
me to be a kind of cross between
a Texan cow-boy and a South Sea
Pirate. I thought there ought
to be something wonderful in
PoEFLEs' play to justify that
costume, but subsequent events
didn't exactly prove it.
We had hunch first in the room
which had been decorated so be-
comingly in green, to be in keep-
ing, no doubt, with the other
“green,” and then we made a
had so many clubs that
PoEFLEs said I had better have
two “caddies” to carry them; I
couldn't make up my mind to
with any of them, as I was
quite sure I should want them all.
Then, just as we were going to
begin, a friend of PoEFLEs came
up, named SLoguM, and said he
would like to join us, so we de-
cided to have a “three-some,” as
PoEFLEs called it. After that
came the trouble. Of which I
will tell you in my next.
OUT OF SCHOOL.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-The chaps
at our place always look upon you
as our great friend. We all take
#. in. At least, one of our fellows
uys your paper, in which is all the
wit and wisdom of the world, and
none of your horrid Greek, Latin,
and other “preserved tongues.”
Aboutmeisno “Familiarity which
breeds contempt,” as SHAKSPEARE
(or some one) says. You will, be
surprised at. my knowing. that
uotation. It comes of trying to
oor our holiday task. Such a
beastly shame! This is how I
haye answered the paper, which
is headed “General Intelligence.”
Here, is the first question:-
“What kind of books do you like
best; give reasons for preference.”
Answer. I like school books
best. , My reason for preferring
them, to novels, is that they in-
struct me, and my progress is
pleasing to my parents and to the
credit of my pastors and masters.
That ought to satisfy them.
Here's number two. “What
wouldlf. like to be in after life;
give full reasonsfor your answer.”
Answer. After life I should like
to be an angel. The full reason
for this reply is surely unneces-
sary. What else could I wish?
several of MARIA’s best wedding
presents, but Ialso scooped a piece out of the carpet with the “niblick,”
which, to say the least of it, was unfortunate. "While I was trying to
glue the piece of carpet down again, MARIA came in suddenly and said
unpleasant things of avery strong description. Ifeltvery annoyed with
MARIA, but then women are always so unreasonable, and MARIA never
could sympathise with anything I wanted to do out of the common.
When I put it to her in this way she retorted, “If you want to swing
sticks about do it “on the common.’” She thought this sharp.
did I: but I didn't say so; I only observed that it was not my fault
if the drawing-room was the only room large enough to “swing” in.
The next day we went down to Ranelagh. Poffles appeared in a
most remarkable costume, which certainly didn't add to his personal
appearance... He had a large wide-awake hat of a description
adopted by BUFFAI3.BILL in his great scalp-hunting operations...To
Had them there! Here's ano-
ther:-"A man blows his tea to make it cool, and blows his hands
to make them warm-explain this seemingly *{ proceeding.”.
Answer. Because he must blow something. When he has nothing
else to blow he blows his nose.
And now for the last I attempted:—“Where do yºu get your
sugar, salt, mustard, and vinegar, and what are they P’’
Answer. I get my sugar, salt,mustard, and vinegar from my dear
parents, and am told (by them) that they are paid for. -
If that doesn't get me a reputation for filial devotion and simple
credulity (I have looked those words out in the dictionary), call me a
Dutchman!
But do protest against holiday tasks in play-time, there’s a good
chap. .# now I can't write any more rot, as I am off to spend the
ten shillings my Uncle CHARLEs, gave me for necessaries at the tuck

JOTTINGS AND TITTLINGS.
(By Baboo HURRY BUNGsHo JABBERJEE, B.A.)
No. X,
Mr. Jabberjee is taken to see a Glove-Pght.
A Young sprightly, Londoner, acquaintance of mine, who is a
member of a Sportish Club where exhibitions of fisticuffs are
periodically given, did generously invite me, on a recent Monday
evening to be the eye-witness of this gladiatorial spectacle.
And, though not constitutionally bellicose, I eagerly accepted his
invitation on being assured that I should not be requisitioned to take
part personally in such pugilistic exercises, and should observe same
from a safe distance and coign of vantage, for I am sufficiently a
lover of sportfulness to appreciate highly the sight of courage and
science in third parties.
So he conducted me to the Club-house, and by the open sesame of a
ticket enabled me to penetrate the barrier, after which I followed his
wake downstairs, through rooms full of smoking and conversing
sportlovers mostly in festal attire, to a long, and lofty hall with
balconies and a stage at the further end with foliage painted in
imitation of a forest, which was tenanted by press reporters.
The centre of the hail was monopolised by a white square platform
confined by a circumambience of rope, which I was informed was
the veritable theatre of war and cockpit.
Presently two hobbardyhoys made, the ascent of this platform
with their attendant myrmidons, and did prºceed to remove their
trouserings and coats until they were in the state of nature with the
exception of a loincloth, whereupon the President or Master of the
Ceremonies introduced them and their respective partisans by name
to the assemblage, stating their precise ponderability, and that these
juvenile antagonists were fraternally related by ties of brotherhood.
At which I was revolted, for it is against nature and contra bonos
mores that relations should be egged on into family jars, nor can
such proceedings tend to promote the happiness and domesticity of
their home circle. However, on such occasion when the youths were
in danger of inflicting corporal injuries, upon each other, the
President called out Time” in such reproving tones that they hung
their heads in shamefulness and desisted. And at length they were
persuaded into a pacification, and made the amende honorable by
shaking each other by the hand, whereat I was rejoiced, for, as Poet
WATTs says, “Birds which are in little nests should refrain from
falling out.”
The victory was adjudged to the elder brother—in obedience, I
suppose, to the rule of Primogeniture, for he did not succeed in
reducing his opponent to a hors de combat.
Next came a more bustling engounter between Misters BILL
HUSBAND and MYSTERIOUs SMITH, which was protracted to the
duration of eight rounds, I was largely under the impression that
the excessive agility with which he removed his head from vicinity
of the blows of Mister MySTERIOUs SMITH,
It was truly magnificent to see how they did embrace each other
% the neck, and the wonderment and suspicion in their glances
when one discovered that he was resting his chin upon the padded
hand of his adversary, and from time to time the Hon’ble Chair-
man was heard ordering them to “break away,” and "not to hold,”
or requesting us to refrain from any remarks. And at intevals they
retired to sit upon chairs in opposing corners, where they rinsed their
mouths, and were severely fanned by their bearers, who agitated a
large towel after the manner of a punkah. But, in the end, it was
Mysterious Mister SMITH who hit the right nail on the head, and was
declared the conquering hero, though once more I was incapacitated
to discover in what F. respects he was the facile princeps.
Around the hall there were placards announcing that smoking was
respectfully prohibited, and the President did repeatedly intreat
members of the audience to refrain from blowing a cloud, assuring
them that the perfume of tobacco was noxious and disgustful to the
combatants, and threatening to mention disobedient tobacconists by
name,
Whereupon most did desist; but some, secreting their cigars in
the hollow of their hands, took whiffs by stealth, and blushed to
find it fame; while others, who were such grandees and big pots that
their own convenience was the first and foremost desideratum, con-
tinued to smoke with lordliness and indifference.
And I am an approver of such conduct—for it is unreasonable that
a well-bred, genteel sort of individual should make the total sacri-
fice of a cigar, for which he has perhaps paid as much as two or even
four annas, out of consideration for insignificant common chaps
hired to engage in snipsnaps for his entertainment.
The last competition was to be the bonne bouche and pièce de résist-
ance of the evening, consisting of a rumpus in twenty rounds be-
tween Misters ToM TRACY of Australia, and ToMMY WILLIAMS, from
the same #.º. at which I was on the tiptoe of expectation.
But, although they commenced with, dancing activity, one of the
ToMs in the very first round sparred the other under the chin with
such superabundant energy that he immediately became a recum-
bent for a lengthy period, and, on being elevated to a chair, only
recaptured sufficient consciousness to abandon the sponge.
And then, to my chapfallen disappointment, the Chairman
announced that he was very sorry and could not help it, but that
was the concluding box of the evening.
I will reluctantly confess that, on the whole, I found the proceed-
ings lacking in sensationality, since they were of very limited dura-
tion, and totally devoid of bloodshed, or any danger to the life and
limb of the performers. . For it is not reasonably possibly for a
combatant to make a palpable hit when his hands are, as it were,
muzzled, being cabined, cribbed, and confined in padded soft glovea,
I am not a squeamish in such cases, and I must respectfully submit

Mister HUSBANd was to win, owing to the acclamationshereceived, and
that the Cause of True Sport can only be hampered by such nursery

and puerile restrictions, for none can expect to compound an ome-
lette without the fracture of eggs. -
Upon remarking as above to my young lively friend, he assured
me that even a gloved hand was *::::: to produce facial dis-
figurement and tap the vital fluid, and offered to demonstrate the
* of his statement if I would be the partaker with him in a glove-
X.
But jº, doubting the authenticity of his assertions, I thought
it inden ial to decline the proof of the pudding, and so took a pre-

ness, and many promises to put on the gloves with him at the first
convenient opportunity.
A LITTLE WALK. (From Monte Carlo to Nice.)
THAT is, from La Turbie. Up to La Turbie by train. Not exactly
a walk so far. Also rather prosaic. The romance begins at the top,
on the famous and beautiful Route de la Corniche. Arrived there,
find everyone strolls quite naturally into a restaurant, which might
be in Paris, except that it is filled with English and Germans.
Probably the romance begins further on. From the terrace look
down, in both senses of the word, on the little mass of white build-
ings, variously described as “the plague spot of the Riviera,” mostly
in serious English books, and “Un paradis terrestre,” mostly in
frivolous French newspapers. Fine view of the gimcrack Casino, the
showy hotels, the tawdry cafés. Can almost see the winners faring
sumptuously at the Café des Millionnaires, or the Restaurant, des
Richissimes, and the losers hastening to the numerous little offices
inscribed “Avances sur Bjouz.” Can almost hear the music (!)
outside the café in the Place du Casino, that execrable noise which
some strangers may innocently imagine is produced by the Monte
Carlo orchestra, celebrated throughout the world. It is not.
After déjeuner stroll along the Cornice Road, towards Nice, and
meet a German tourist, carrying a grey umbrella. Did anyone ever
see a German tourist without a ſº umbrella? Ask him about the
road. He speaks English excellently. He says, “You go on till
you meet a public-house.” Thank him, and stroll on, admiring the
blue sea and the distant view, till I meet the public-house, which is
incribed “Café Restaurant. Chambres et Salons Réservés.” No
doubt very much réservés, since they all seem quite empty. But no.
As I approach, two persons come out and walk before me. The lady
is plump, though young. As I follow her I estimate that the cir-
cumference of her waist is about forty inches. Her dress is not
elegant, and she wears a green, soft felt hat. The gentleman also
wears agreen hat, and he carries a grey umbrella. Possibly they are
Germans., “ Wie?. Ja!. Ach, so Wºº Ja, ja, ja! Ach wun-
derschön! Ja, ja, ja! So?. Ja, ja, ja!”. There is no longer any
doubt. They walk on arm in arm, and the man's brots creak at
every step.
Cannot possibly walk all the way to Nice behind a man who talks
German loudly, who wears a green hat, and whose boots creak
incessantly. Could have tolerated the green hat, as it reminds me,
in form and colour, of the hat of Noah in my early childhood, but
the boots are beyond endurance. Loiter about and let them carry
their wearer out of hearing.
By this time there are clouds in the sky and the view is all grey-
sea, sky, hills, trees. The only spots of colour are the i. hats of
the Germans, vanishing in the distance. It will probably rain soon.
There is Willefranche just down below. Will step down in a few
minutes and catch a train to take me back to Nice in time for dinner;
Start down gaily. . A peasant recommends a short cut. The usual
sort of short cut in the Alpes Maritimes—all jagged stones. The
cutting is chiefly of one's boots. To scramble down this takes longer
than walking along the road. that. Very easy slope. An
immense zigzag. Begin to think it will take more than a few
minutes to get down to Willefranche. Hurry on a little. First I go
half a mile towards Genoa. Then at last the road turns, and I career
half a mile towards Marseilles. The only place I never seem to
approach is Willefranche. At one time am almost at Beaulieu, at
another seem close to Nice. Full speed ahead as much as possible.
Arrive at a place where the awful zigzag divides, and forms two
zigzags. The only person in sight is aJ. woman sitting on a
step. Hope she speaks something besides the Niçois dialect. She
does, for she says, though speaking French with difficulty, “Faut
aller d la gauche,” at the same time pointing to the right. “A
droite on d gauche f" I ask wildly. “Oui,” she answers. No time
for further talk, so choose the road, less obviously leading in the
wrong direction, and on again, Wish I had walked to Nice. Should
have been nearly there now. At last see Willefranche station far
below. Then speed on towards Italy, back again, another glimpse of
station, ...}}. nearer, and on towards Spain. On the return
journey perceive the train in the distance down below, coming round
the bay, Start running, still down zigzags. Ringing of , bells,
shouts, whistles, scream of a locomotive." Rush breathies into station.

UNIVERSITY BOAT CLUB,
(A copy of this hitherto unpublished document has come into the possession
of Mr. Punch, who, out of consideration for his readers, has had it
literally translated, and now offers it to the admiration of the world.)
MY DEAR HERR .# returned from a mott beau-
tiful and never-to-be-forgotten outflight, wherein I visited scenes by
me not to be contemplated without deep-seated feeling, find I a
State-paper from my Imperial Kanzler (he is a good, fellow, the
old HoHENLoBE, but slow, and through a brick-wall he cannot
at all see) informing me that once more the young men of Cam-
bridge have a boatrace lost. . In foregone years, and in this
year too, have I sogar deemed it my duty to send to Oxford
my heartiest luck-wishes on their successful strugglings after vic-
tory. But, pot-thousand again, what does this mean that you seven
times afte: ºne another into the bushes let yourselves be stuck?
Thunder-weather! how can you endure it? My Imperial sympathy
stretches itself to you. In my Palace have I a rowing machine put
up, and daily every mornings, before I myself sponge in my tub, row
I two thousand strokes at two hundred to the minute on the machine.
That is more than your miserable thirty-four, not true? So I have
overlaid these matters in my Imperial_mind filled with goodwill
towards you, and Iannounce to you what I will do. Next year I will
imprison all my Editors for lege-majesté, and for the Socialists will
I a bloodbath set out. Thus I will be free of nuisances and will
come to Cambridge in January with the EMPRESS and the whole
family, not forgetting a monthly nurse for whom most comfortable
rooms are to be taken in your Boathouse. I will then coach, you all
every day, and sometimes, surprise-visiting you in the night, I will
make you row till Aurora appears over the Gogmagogish Mountains.
I will live, together with my suite (500 persons), with your Vice-
Kanzler. Baily I will conduct prayers in your University Church

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
AFTER TwenTY-Two YFARs.
AT Easter time as at Christmas and towards the end of July there
are feast-days and revellings and high solemn occasions at the
yarious schools in which the youth of England faithfully learns the
ingenuous arts which, according to Colonel NewcomE, emollunt mores
nec sinuisse feros., Easter. is the season specially tet apart in the
school calendar for the holding of athletic sports, and from far and
near streams of º and prosperous parents flow towards the
school cricket-field to behold the efforts of their sons struggling for
supremacy with the cricket-ball, over the hurdles, in the jumps, and
in the various other competitions appointed for the testing of swift-
ness, strength, and endurance. Thither, too, come the old *:::
some but lately released from the school fetters, others grey-hea ed
and º to applaud the prowess of their young successors and to
spend an hour or two in converse with old friends. Pleasant
gatherings are these of men, parted by time and circumstance and
the cares of life, who thus for a brief space renew their happy youth,
fight the old fights over again, and tremble once more as § repeat
the tale of their peccadilloes, and of the scrapes over which the
familiar birch cast its baleful but undeterring shadow.
I BRACED myself the other day to climb the Northern height where
my own ºchool-days were passed. It was the day of the athletic
sports, and a sense of things dimly remembered, seen as through a
veil, came over me as I made my way down the lane and neared the
old gate. Boys in caps and flannel shorts and stockings were hurry-
ing along. They all seemed absurdly 3.; and there was about
them a boniness (if the word may be pardoned) and kind of angular
falling short of full development which has, I suppose, always
marked the genus boy. Could it have been that I, too, once hurried
as did these eager competitors; was I indeed so young, so bony, so
angular, so eager; I who, with sober air and me step, was
# down, the lane? Surely the boys of my time were older,
er in, build, less prone, to rush up behind other boys and slap
them violently on their backs, with the certainty that the outrageous
proceeding, far, from breeding resentment, would be treated as
an excellent joke. A Fº sped past me; I caught a scrap
of their conyersation. “So I told him I wouldn't have any of his
beastly cheek. These small boys ought to be jolly well spanked.”
The speaker was not large, but he was evidently larger than
some other boy, and that other boy had cheeked him. There was a
familiar sound about the words, and something in me seemed to
acknowledge that once in the long ago I might possibly have used
them myself. No doubt twenty-two years are grande mortalis aevi
spatium; they bring their hateful and inevitable changes, and the
accursed tailor may, perhaps, have spoken the truth when he hinted,
a few weeks ago, that he thought he would have to allow an inch or
so more round the waist.
OUTSIDE the gate, with a table in front of him, sat an old gentle-
man at the receipt of custom. “Admission, Sir? . Sixpence; pro-
gramme, threepence...Thank you, Sir.” Heavens! It was my old
friend Mr. RogFRs, the hatter, from the High Street, whose tall
form and brilliant auburn beard had been my boyish admiration.
But now the snows of twenty-two years lay thick upon the auburn
though his voice was still hearty. “It’s a long time since we met,
Mr. Rogers,” I ventured to say. “Yes, Sir, time will keep going;
we're both getting a bit older than we were,” and upon this somewhat
painful aphorism I passed into the field. A grave, but kindly-
looking º came towards me, leading by the hand a rosy-
cheeked little fellow of ten or eleven, e looked at me in a
; way and paused as if intending to address me.
Evidently he knew me; but where had we met P The face of the
little boy seemed familiar enough—yes, of course, I knew the little
boy; it was HARRY Ross: we were in the same form, we got flogged
on the same day, we learnt dancing together in the holidays, he
swore he would marry my sister, in fact, wrote the vow down on a
piece of paper and sealed it with black sealing-wax, “I sware that
when I grow up and have one hundred pounds a year of my own I
will mary your sister ALICE: signed and seeled, HARRY Ross.” . I
was about to shake him warmly by the hand and congratulate him
on. ...; younger than ever when I woke with a start from my
dream, and realised that this was HARRY Ross's son, and that the
grave but kindly parent was indeed my old friend HARRY Ross.
WE walked about the field together and managed to knit many
old memories as we walked. In the pavilion a long table groaned
under a gorgeous array of prizes. Here were clocks, dressing-bags.
bats, cups, toast-racks, and even (with a pleasing anticipation of
coming years of freedom) silver cigarette-cases—the trophies of the
victors in the fº. then proceeding. -
“My dear HARRY,” I said, “do you remember that race in the
hundred yards?” “I remember I beat you.” “Yes, that’s just it;
you did beat me, but if I hadn't had the cramp—” “Cramp be
blowed; I always could run a hundred yards faster than you.”
“You couldn't.” “I could. I’ll run you now.” - -
But at this proposal the younger HARRY was taken with so violent
a fit of laughter, that we went no further with it... Poor little boy!
of course he couldn't realise how young we both felt at an age which
to him, no doubt, seemed of an unattainable antiquity. Still a look
at the pavilion wall might have justified him, for on the board of honour
there the names of more than twenty School Elevens were painted
after the Eleven that contained his father's name and mine.
In the field the sports proceeded merrily. Long boys flung them-
selves into contortions over the high jump, short boys toppled in
heaps over hurdles, panting boys wore down oppositiºn, and raced
aliantly home in the mile; and in the School Handicap countless
#. boys, dotted about the grass like stars, awaited the firing of
the pistol, and then sprang forward for the race. ... Need I say
that all my sympathies went with the diminutive limit-boy. He
struggled gallantly, but, alas! he was overborne, at, last, by, a
sturdier and bigger rival, and was forced to subside into the
ruck. Finally came the glorious presentation of the prizes. How
those boys cheered and shouted as the heroes of the day stepped
modestly forward to receive their prizes, , how, they cheered
(as though to show there was no trace of ill-feeling left in
their minds) when the head-master stepped out and ºl.
the victors in a few hearty, well-chosen words. Nor did we omit
to praise and cheer “the mens sana in corpore sqno,” words not un-
known, indeed, at school athletics, but true and welcome notwith-
standing. . It was a right, pleasant day, and we wºund it up, not
ingloriously with a dinner in the evening, a dinner for the old boys
who had graced the occasion. Yet, as I stood on the station platform,
awaiting the last train, I seemed to have had a few years added tº
my tale. But another “old boy” who had come from Cambridge, felt
no such qualms. He had enjoyed his dinner, and he was now singing
up and down the platform. “Isn't it splendiá, old fellow,” he
remarked to a friend, “why, I’ve been proctorised for much less
than this at Cambridge.” Oh, daring and tremendous old boy, the
melancholy time must come when even proctors will cease to be a
terror.

and puerile restrictions, for none can expect to compound anome-
lette without the fracture of eggs.
º: remarking as above to my young lively friend, he assured
me that even a gloved hand was *::::: to produce facial dis-
figurement and tap the vital fluid, and offered to demonstrate the
truth of his statement if I would be the partaker with him in a glove-
box.
But, though doubting the authenticity of his assertions, I thought
it indenti to decline the prºof of the pudding, and so took a pre-
cipitate leave of him with profuse thanks for his unparagoned kind-
ness, and many promises to put on the gloves with him at the first
convenient opportunity.
A LITTLE WALK. (From Monte Carlo to Nice.)
THAT is, from La Turbie. Up to La Turbie by train. Not exactly
a walk so far. Also rather prosaic. The romance begins at the top,
on the famous and beautiful Route de la Corniche. Arrived there,
find everyone strolls quite naturally into a restaurant, which might
be in Paris, except that it is filled with English and Germans.
Probably the romance begins further on... From the terrace look
down, in both senses of the word, on the little mass of white build-
ings, variously described as “the plague spot of the Riviera,” mostly
in serious English books, and “Un paradis terrestre,” mostly in
frivolous French newspapers. Fine view of the gimcrack Casino, the
showy hotels, the tawdry cafés. Can almost see the winners faring
sumptuously at the Café des Millionnaires, or the Restaurant, des
Richissimes, and the losers hastening to the numerous little offices
inscribed “Avances sur Bjouz.” Can almost hear the music (!)
outside the café in the Place du Casino, that execrable noise which
some strangers may innocently imagine is produced by the Monte
Carlo orchestra, celebrated throughout the world. It is not.
After déjeuner stroll along the Cornice Road, towards Nice, and
meet a German tourist, carrying a grey umbrella. Did anyone ever
see a German tourist without a grey umbrella? Ask him about the
road. He speaks English excellently. He says, “You go on till
you meet a §: Thank him, and stroll on, admiring the
blue sea and the distant view, till I meet the public-house, which is
incribed “Café Restaurant. Chambres et Salons Réservés.” No
doubt very much réservés, since they all seem quite empty. But no.
As I approach, two persons come out and walk before me. The lady
is plump, though young. As I follow her I estimate that the cir-
cumference of her waist is about forty inches. Her dress is not
elegant, and she wears a green, soft felt hat. The gentleman also
wears a green hat, and he carries a grey umbrella. Possibly they are
Germans., “ Wie?. Ja!. Ach so! Wo? Ja, ja, ja! Ach wun-
derschön 1 Ja, ja, ja! So? Ja, ja, ja ” There is no longer any
doubt. They w on arm in arm, and the man's brots creak at
every step.
Cannot possibly walk all the way to Nice behind a man who talks
German loudly, who wears a green hat, and whose boots creak
incessantly. Could have tolerated the green hat, as it reminds me,
in form and colour, of the hat of Noah in my early childhood, but
the boots are beyond endurance. Loiter about and let them carry
their wearer out of hearing.
By this time there are clouds in the sky and the view is all grey—
sea, sky, hills, trees. The only spots of colour, are the green hats of
the Germans. vanishing in the distance. It will probably rain soon.
There is Willefranche just down below. Will step down in a few
minutes and catch a train to take me back to Nice in time for dinner;
Start down gaily. . A peasant recommends a short cut. The usual
sort of short ºut in the Alpes Maritimes—all jagged stones. The
cutting is chiefly of one's boots. To scramble down this takes longer
than walking along the road. Try that. , Very easy, slope. An
immense zigzag, Begin to think it will take more than a few
minutes to get down to Willefranche. Hurry on a little. First I go
half a mile towards Genoa. Then at last the road turns, and I career
half a mile towards Marseilles. The only place I never seem to
approach is Willefranche. At one time am almost at Beaulieu, at
another seem close to Nice. Full speed ahead as much as possible.
Arrive at a place where the awful zigzag divides, and forms two
zigzags. The only person in sight is a peasant woman sitting on a
step. Hope she speaks something besides the Niçois dialect. She
does, for she says, though speaking French, with difficulty, “Faut
aller d la gauche,” at the same time pointing to the right. “A
droite ou dº gauchef” I ask wildly. “Out,” she answers. No time
for further talk, so choose the road, less obviously leading in the
wrong direction, and on again, Wish I had walked to Nice. Should
have been nearly there now. At last see Willefranche station far
below. Then speed on towards Italy, back again, another glimpse of
station, º no nearer, and on towards Spain. On the return
journey perceive the train in the distance down below, coming round
the bay, Start running, still down zigzags. Ringing of , bells,
shouts, whistles, scream of a locomotive. Rush breathies into station.

MY DEAR HERR .# returned from a mott beau-
tiful and never-to-be-forgotten outflight, wherein I visited scenes by
me not to be contemplated without deep-seated feeling, find I, a
State-paper from my Imperial Kanzler (he is a good fellow, the
old HoHENLoBE, but slow, and through a brick-wall he cannot
at all see) informing me that once more the young men of Cam-
bridge have a boatrace lost. . In foregone years, and in this
year too, have I sogar deemed it my duty to send to Oxford
my heartiest luck-wishes on their successful strugglings after vic-
tory. But, pot-thousand again, what does this mean that you seven
times after ºne another into the bushes let yourselves be stuck?
Thunder-weather! how can you endure it? My Imperial sympathy
stretches itself to you. In my Palace have I a rowing machine put
up, and daily every mornings, before I myself sponge in my tub, row
Itwo thousand strokes at two hundred to the minute on the machine.
That is more than your miserable thirty-four, not true? So I have
overlaid these matters in my Imperial_mind filled with goodwill
towards you, and Iannounce to you what I will do. Next year I will
imprison all my Editors for lese-majesté, and for the Socialists will
I a bloodbath set out. Thus I will be free of nuisances and will
come to Cambridge in January with the EMPREss and the whole
family, not forgetting a monthly nurse for whom most comfortable
rooms are to be taken in your Boathouse. I will then coach you all
every day, and sometimes, surprise-visiting you in the night, I will
make you row till Aurora appears over the Gogmagogish Mountains.
I will live, together with my suite (500 persons), with your Vice-
Kanzler. Daily I will conduct prayers in your University Church
where all must attend, and will examine your young men for their
mathematical knowledge three times in every week. For the Cam-

WHAT shall the Baron say of The Statement of Stella Maberley,
written by “Herself” (an entirely new authoresa) ard published by
FISHER UN win P. It appears to me, quot's 15 a -aren, that, had not
this work been “precursed,” so to put it classically and not incor-
rectly, in more fenses than one, by that awful story of the Great
God Pan (a revival of the legend of Le Succube, ou }}. femelle)
in the Key-note Series (when key-notes were at their highest pitch,
or lowest, whichever it may have been), it might have attracted with
all the glamour of such originality as, in the time of ByRon and
SBELLEY, fascinated the readers of Frankenstein. The Statement
ºf Stella Maberley shows undoubted cleverness, and it is consistent
in its puzzlement and in its weird, real unreality. It might form the
third ºf a new series, to be entitled “The Lunatic Library,” of
which the two first volumes, according to my selection, would be The
Germ Growers and The Wonderful Visit.
Mr. FISHER UN win is a bold man, even for a publisher. He has
invited the young men and girls who write books for him to sit
down ald discourse about their work and themselves. Overcoming
natural ard almost impassable diffidence, they have accepted the
mission. The result appears in a little volume, entitled Good
Reading About Many Books, mostly by their Authors. The inno-
cent little thing (price one shilling nett) is appropriately issued in
snow-white cover. Some of the biographical details are quite
thrilling. Here, for example, is what Mr. HARold SPENDER, author
of At the Sign of the Guillotine, says:—
“I come of a family that has now spilt ink in profusion for two genera-
tions, and, I should not like to say how many reams of paper have been
blackened by my relatives in their transit from the paper-mills to the waste-
paper basket.”
This graphic picture of Mr. SPENDER's relatives on their way
from .." er-mills to the waste-paper basket, apparently oozing
black blood, beats the primest efforts of the Fat Boy in the way of
making your flesh º The Good Reading is not all quite as good
as this. But, taken a little at a time, it is charming.
In The Cloud ºf Witness, the Oxford University Press has turned
out a sumptuous book worthy their high renown. It is in every
way luxurious, though happily not after the fashion of the ordinary
éditions de lure, with which the casual reader most conveniently
wrestles prone on the drawing-room floor. As a work of the
printers' and bookbinders' art, it is so distractingly charming that
my Baronite almost forgot to read it. This omission corrected, its
contents, compiled by Mrs. LYTTLEToN GELL, are found to be worthy
of their unique mode of presentation. Mrs. GELL has culled the
poesy garden of the§.” and deftly arranges her bouquets in daily
sequence following the Christian seasons. Some clear, high note is
struck for every day. -
One of the Baron's Deputy-Assistants, has been sampling Mrs.
HELEN BLAck's Pen, Pencil, Baton, and Mask, with satisfactory
results. He says that the volume, which contains some sixty or
seventy “portraits in quill and ink,” is full of interest not only to
the subjects of the sketches, but to the public at large. The bio-
graphies are capital blends of black and white; the authoress's
name supplies the first, and her godd-nature the second: “Quite a
brok,” concludes the Deputy-Assistant, “to read for pleasure for a
week, and to keep for reference for a century.”

No. XI.
Mr. Jabberjee finds himself in a position of extreme delicacy,
It is an indubitable fact that the discovery of steam is the most
marvellous invention of the century. For had it been predicted
beforehand that innumerable millions of human beings would be
transported with security at a headlong speed for hundreds of miles
along a ferruginous track. the most temporary deviation from which
would produce the inevitable cataclysm and aw smash, the
majority would have expressed their candid opinion of such rhodo-
montade by cocking the contemptuous snook of incredulity.
And yet it is now the highly
accomplished fact and matter of
as if to milk the ram to set her bonnet at a
who regarded her with nothing but platonic
her to sit down for the recovery of her wind.
But alack! this speech only operated to inspire her, with the
spretae º: formae, and flourishing a large stalwart umbrella, she
exclaimed that she would teach me how to insult a lady.

esteem, and advising
and at the nick of time, when she was about to descend like a wolf
on a fold, I most fortunately perceived a bell-handle provided for
such pressing emergencies, and rung it with such unparalleled
energy, that the train immediately became stationary.
Then, as * female persecutrels alighted on the floor of the com-
partment in t
e limp condition of a collapse, I stepped across to my
original seat, and endeavoured to
course!
Still, I shall venture to express
the opinion that the pleasura-
bility of such railway journeys is
largely dependent upon the per-
son who may be our travelling
companion, and that some of the
companies are not quite careful
enough in the exclusion of unde-
sirable fellow - passengers. In
proof of which I now beg to sub-
mit an exemplary instance from
personal experience.
I was recently the payer of a
ceremonial visit to a friend of my
boyhood, namely, BAB00 CHUck-
EhBUTTY RAM, with whom, find-
ing him at home in his lodging 3
in a distant suburb, I did hold
politely affectionate intercourse,
for the space of two hours, and
then departed, as I had come, by
train, and the sole occupant of a
second-class dual compartment
divided by a low partition.
At the next station the adjoin-
ing compartment was suddenly
invaded by a portly female of the
matronly type, with a rubicund
countenance and a brmnet in a
dismantled and lopsided condi-
tion, who was bundled through
the doorway by the impetuosity
of a porter, and occupied a seat
in immediate opposition to myself.
When the train resumed its
motion, I observed that she was
contemplating me with a beaming
simper of indescribable suavity,
and, though she was of an un-
ornamental exterior and many
years my superior, I constrained
myself from motives of merest
politºness tº do some simpering
in return, since only a churlish
would grudge such an economical
look as if with withers *...;
Presently the Guard appeared,
and what followed I can best
render in the dramatical form of
a dialogue:—
The Guard (addressing the
Elderly Female, who is sitting
smiling with vacuity beneath the
bell-pull). So it is you who have
sounded the alarm! What is it
all about P
The Elderly Female (with warm
indignati n). Me? I never did I
I am too much of the lady. It
was that young coloured gentle-
man in the next compartment.
[At which the tip of my nose
goes down with apprehensive-
71.687.
The Guard. Indeed! A likely
story ! How could the gentleman
ring this bell from where he is P
Myself (with mental presence).
Well said, Mister GUARD ! The
thing is not humanly possible.
Ren acutetigisti /
The Guard. I do not under-
stand Indian, Sir. If you have
anything to say about this affair,
you had better say it.
Myself (combining discretion
with magnanimousness). As a
chivalrous, I must decline to
bring any accusation against a
member of the weaker sex, and
my tongue is hermetically sealed.
The Eld. F. It was him who
rang the alarm, and not me. He
was in this compartment, and I
in that.
The Guard. What? have you
been playing at Hide-and-seek
together, then P. But if your
story is watertight, he must have
rung the bell in a state of abject
and inexpensive civility.
But whether she was of an un-
usually ardent temperament, or whether, against my volition, I had
invested my simper with an irresistible winsomeness, I cannot tell;
but she fell to making nods and becks and wreathed smiles which
reduced me to crimson sheepishness, and the necessity of looking
earnestly out of window at vacancy.
At this she entreated me passionately not to be unkind, inviting |G
me to gross to the next compartment and seat myself by her side;
but I did nill this invitation politely, urging that Company's bye-
laws countermanded the placing of boots upon the seat-cushions,
and my utter inability to pose as a Romeo to scale the barrier.
Whereupon, to my lively horror and amazement, she did exclaim,
“Then I will, cyme to you, darling !”. and commenced to scramble
precipitately towards me over the partition 1
At which I was in the blue funk, perceiving the arcanum of her
design to embrace me, and resolved to leave no stone unturned for
the preservation of my bacon. So, at the moment she made the
entrance into my compartment, I did simultaneously hop the twi
into the next, and she followed in pursuit, and I once more achiev
the return with inconceivable agility.
Then, as we were both, like, Hamlet, fat and short ºf breath, I
addressed her gaspingly across the barrier, assuring her that it was
“A beaming simper of indescribable suavity.”

chivying him about!

Myself (after he had obtained this, and was departing). Mister
uard, I do most earnestly entreat you not to abandon me to the
mercies of this female woman. I am not a proficient in physical
courage, and have no desire to test the correctness of Poet Pope's
assertion, that Hell does not possess the fury of a scorned woman. I
request to be conducted into a better-populated compartment.
The Guard (with complimentary jocosity). Ah, such young good-
looking chaps as you ought to go about in a veil. Come with me,

So the incident was closed, and I did, greatly ºr. myself
upon the sagacity and coolness of head with which I extricated
myself from my pretty kettle of fish, For to have denounced myself
as the real alarmist would have rendered the affair more, rather than
less, discreditable to my feminine companion, and I should have been
arraigned before the solemn bar of a police-court magistrate, who
might even have made a Star Chamber matter of the incident.

THAT GAME OF GOLF.
No. II.
WELL, there we were, Poffles, SLOGUM, and myself. Poffles
went of first, but the ball didn't seem to me to go as far as PoEFLEs
meant it to, judging by the energy he put, into it. It couldn't
have travelled more than twenty yards in all., SLOGUM said that
PoEFLEs “sliced” it, and one of my caddies said he “topped” it,
and SLOGUM's that he “pulled” it, and a gentleman we didn't
know came up and aid that PoEFLEs “toed" it a bit and didn't
'' play it through.” We argued this for a quarter of an hour, and
then PoEFLEs got sulky, and said he hadn't come there to be talked
to by a lot of “foozelers,” and that he knew what he had done, and
had done it on F; to get a “good lie.” I thought this was “a
gocd lie,” but I didn't say so.
Then SLoguyſ went off, and his ball went much farther than
PoEFLEs' ball, but it made a funny sort of curve round to the right,
and landed in a bush. After that it was my turn, I wanted to play
with that “niblick,” but PoEFLEs and the gentleman we didn't know
wouldn't let me. They said it wasn't the game. So I took the
44 ſººn bulger driver,” and let fly at the ball for all I was
Worth.
PoEFLEs gasped when he saw me let out at that ball, and the
caddie nearest me said “Strike me,” under his breath, and another
caddie said “S'elp me.” Then we looked to see where the ball would
come down, but it didn't come down, I said I must have driven it
into the river, and felt proud, and Porries said it must have got
fixed up one of the trees, and the gentleman we didn’t know.said it
was most curious. We were just going to put down another ball,
when one of my caddies who was making the “tee” suddenly gave
a “guffaw,” and digging down into the ground about six inches
Fº the ball. There it was safe enough, deep in the earth
elow the tee, and we had another argument to explain how it got
there. PoEFLEs said I was too near the ball, and SLOGUM said I
“pressed too much,” and the gentleman we didn't know said he
thought I “took my eye off the ball.”. We couldn't settle it any
way, so I drove off again, and this time I did hit it, and to every-
body's surprise (though it was what they called a short hole) it landed
on the green, just over the “bunker,” as they said, “in one.” (I
didn't know what a bunker was, but I wasn't going to say so.) |
Then we went and looked at SLOGUM's ball, which had stuck in the
middle of a big bush, full of thorns and things. PoEFLEs said
SLogum must “play it out,” according to Rule 29, which says, a
ball is to be played “wherever it lies.” TSLoggy, however, said that,
according to Rule 18, when a ball is covered with “fog, bent whins,”
&c., as much shall be set aside as will give the player “a view of his
ball,” and he hadn't *
sition to strike, so the bush ought to be “set aside.” Then
of FLEs' caddie said, according to Rule 12, a player must not “move,
bend, or break anything, fixed or growing, near the ball, except in
placing his feet on the ground to address the ball,” and the gentle-
man we didn't know said that the bush was a “hazard,” and
according to Rule 14, nothing must be touched or moved before the
player strikes the ball when it lies in a hazard. Then SLOGUM got
savage and said he would lie down under the bush and “scrape it
out,” but Pof FLES said that was against Rule 4, which says, you
mustn't “push, scrape, or spoon a ball.” S2, SLOGUM had to º it.
out after all, and a glorious time he had with that bush, whilst we
sat round and encouraged him, Poffles particularly advising him to
“go right in and hit it.”
After that, Poffles, and SLoguM got on, the green somehow, and
one of the caddies offered me a “putter.” SLOGUM said I must
“put” the ball down next, and I wanted to “put' it with that
niblick, but they wouldn't let me, so I had to use the putter and
I got the ball quite near the hole, and SLOGUM, who “putted” next,
knocked my ball in and one, of the caddies said it was “bogey,”
though I couldn't see what “bogies” had to do with it any way.
Then Poff Lºs said he was down in twenty-seven, and SLoguM said he
wasn't, and they argued thatten minutes, and the caddies all argued
too. While they were arguing, there was a funny man behind me
shouting “four” at the top of his voice, and I wondered what was the
matter with him. Ireckoned, from the way he was going on, that he
felt really bad, so I sat down on the grass to watch him. I did so
he seemed to be taken much worse, for he jumped round, and screamed,
and waved his club in a way that was simply frantic. Then on the
other side of him there was another man who suddenly seemed
taken in the same way, as he commenced to dance round and
yell “four,” too. I thought they might be playing “nap” or some-
view of that ball at all when he was in a -
PoEFLEs (who was, still arguing) about it, something caught me in
the back like a bullet, and I sat down on the grass again and used
language...that must have been painful to listen to. Then those
two lunatics who had been shouting “Four” came up and asked me
why the “blank blank” I didn’t take my “blank blank blank
anatomy” out of the way when I saw them coming up, and PoEFLRs,
who was already as mad as he could be, asked them what the “blank
blank” they meant by playing on º: when they were still on the
green, and SLOGUM said they ought to know better, and then the
lunatics said they weren't going to wait our “blank blank 'pleasure
all the “blank” day while we #. on the green, and then two of
the caddies began to fight, and I was getting my niblick ready for
one of those idiots when the gentleman we didn't know came up and
; us to be calm, and not to disgrace the precincts with an
undignified dispute. So we parted the two caddies, and SLogu M.
said we had better let the other party pass us; and so we waited till
they had gone, and how we played on, and what we did, I will reserve
for my third and last.

WONDERS On WHEELS,
(By an Old Beginner.)
. Won DER if my doctor was
right in ordering me to take
this sort of exercise.
Wonder whether I look very
absurd while accepting the as-
sistance of an attendant who
walks by my tide and keeps me
from falling by clutches at my
waistbelt.
Wonder whether it would
have been better to go to Hyde
Park instead of Battersea.
Wonder whether the police-
man, the postman, the nurse
with the ºperambulator, the
young lady reading the novel,
and the deck passengers on the
passing steamboat are laughing
at me.
Wonder whether I shall keep
on now that my attendant has
let go.
Wonder whether the leading
wheel will keep straight on until
we have passed that lamp-post.
Wonder whether the next
#. I have will be less painful
than the last.
Wonder why mats are not
laid down by the County Council
in the roads for the comfort of
falling cyclists.
Wonder why the cycle sud-
denly doubled up and landed
me in the gutter.
Wonder whether the pretty
girl in the hat, whose face is
hidden by a novel, ºniled at my
misadventure.
Wonder whether the person
who has just come to grief over
yonder, is using good language
or words of an inferior quality.
Wonder whether my a ten-
dant is right in urging me to
remount and have an ºther try.

Wonder whether the elderly

and air of determination is really
enjoying herself.
Wonder whether, when I have
completed my first hour, I shall
want another.
Wonder whether the imp of a

Wonder whether my second
fall in five minutes beats the

Wonder, considering the diffi-
culty of progressing half a dozen

Wonder if I shall ever ad-

OLD crusted port, Sir, is the stuff
To make you wise and merry,
For he would be an awful duff-
-er who selected sherry.
Maderia if made cheaper would
Be certainly worth trying;
Your Rhenish wines I never should
Consider worth the buying.
Now Burgundy, I will admit,
Is worthy of attention,
Tho' connoisseurs have made of it
The beaune of much contention.
Good claret it is hard to find,
Unless you're an importer;
Vin ordinaire is, to my mind,
Like vinegar and water.
But here’s a picture, caked in dust,
Now steady, do not shake it,
There's an aroma! there’s a crust 1
'Twould be a crime to break it:
A wine like this, you littie thought
To pour into your throttle,
No finer vintage can be bought-
At one-and-three the bottle.
Then up arose the guest to post
A most important letter.
Thought he, “Such rare, old wine, good;
host,
The rarer’tis, the better!”
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

House of Commons, Monday, April 13.-
GEORGE WYNDHAM made to-night what,
though not the best speech he has delivered
since he sat for Dover, was certainly the most
immediately effective. All his eches are
full of matter, admirably p , and with
the making of a good delivery. But his more
elaborate efforts have not succeeded in catch-
ing ear of House. For one thing they have
been too elaborate, too lengthy, lacking in
º: Moreover, by malign ill fortune
they have always chanced to be estayed at
unfortunate periods of a sitting, either in
dinner-hour or towards close of debate already
wearisomely long. On one occasion in last
Parliament, having come down prepared with
speech that was to blow up Ministry with
dynamite force, matters took a sudden turn
that, in interests of Qpposition, called for
suppression of the speech.
at not the only disappointment of a still

His intimate personal relations with PRINCE
ARTHUR, with whom he worked as unpaid
Private Secretary, seemed to point him out for
Ministerial office. Weighing in the balance
bis claims, capability, and suitability, against
those of Mr. JESSE Col.I.INGs and Mr. Powell
WILLIAMs for example, PRINCE ARTHUR with
Spartan inflexibility was bound to admit that
his brilliant young friend was quite out of it.
So WYNDHAM wended his way across what is
not always the Styx of the Gangway, and,
in the clearer atmosphere that ;. Over
that part of House, perceives that whatever
PRINCE ARTHUR and his colleagues in the
Ministry do is not always right.
To-night, dº propos de bottes, and talking
of morning sittings on Tuesdays, he said so,
to immense delight of gentlemen opposite,
who would not have listened to him had he
demonstrate theinevitableness and real bene-
ficence of the arrangement.
“A delicate and difficult part to play, that
of below-the-Gangway-candid-friend,” says
the veteran SARK. “Looks so easy; has in
several instances, more especially to be found
on Front Opposition Bench, proved successful,
that anyone thinks he can do it. As SILoMIo

they were not primarily developed below the

that didn't satisfy him, as he kept turning back and swearing
at us at intervals as he went away, and muttering something
about losing a medal through a darned jackanapes who didn't
know a golf ball from a mushroom. The other man appeared
to be trying to console him with some remarks about “Dormie
4,” and the “rub of the green,” but what he was driving at I
don't know, as the green didn't seem to me to be rubbed any-
where, and if it was I hadn't done it. In fact I couldn't see
what was the matter at all, and PoEFLEs and SLOGUM talked so
fast and made such a noise that I couldn't hear what they said,
so I said I should go home, as it seemed to me a silly sort of
game, in spite of the niblick, and I was fairly mad too.
We agreed to play one more hole, however, and the drive was
over a large pond. PoEFLEs drove first, and £. beautifully
into the middle of the pond, and SLOGUM did the same thing.
Then PoEFLEs said they would both drive again; which they
did, and they put two more balls into the pond, and then two
more after that. I began to think the hole must be in the
pond somewhere, but I wasn’t sure. Then PoEFLEs said he
cyuld get the bails out if Stogum would help him; and they
both got into a kind of punt, and floated out, and PoEFLEs
scraped about after the balls, while SLQGUM steered the punt.
Then, just as PoEFLEs was reaching after a ball, he lost his
balance, and clutched at SLoguM, and they both went wallo
into the pond together, and fought each other in the water.
didn't know if this was part of the game, but the caddies and
I enjoyed it thoroughly; and then we hauled them out, and
they were a sight for the gods. -
After this we went back to the kit-cat room, and changed,
PoEFLEs and SLOGUM were quite pleased with
themselves, and talked so much about their strokes, that I came
to the conclusion I had missed some extraordinary play by not
THAT GAME OF GOLF.
No. III.
WELL, the row being over, and the objectionable parties gone, we
continued, that is, Poffſ. Es, SLOGUM, and myself. All more or less
ruffled, as you may º: if you remember the scene I described in
the previous number. We managed to get through the next four holes
somehow without coming to blows, although it was wonderful what a
number of strokes it required. I saw Poffles slogging away in one
place for about a quarter of an hour, swearing all the time; it was a
fort of ditch, with stones in it, and he drove every mortal thing out
of that ditch except his ball, including about a cart-load of earth.
I couldn't think why he should choose that ditch to play in.
SLOGUM was not much better; and as for my ball, it went on in
the most extraordinary way. Sometimes it went round to the left,
and sometimes to the *::: but mostly it stayed where it was, or
hopped a yard or two. One of my caddies said I ought to “take a
bit of the turf with it,” and the other said I played “too much of a
cricket, stroke”; and a man who was looking on said he thought I
didn't hit hard enough, and smiled. Sometimes I got a bit mad
with it, and then I always used the niblick, and that generally
fetched it along together with some square feet of turf and a shovelful
of mud and stones.
PoEFLEs and SL9GUM argued all the time, but I couldn't under-
stand what they said. , SLogum said he didn’t like PoEFLEs’ “style”
at all; that he hadn't any “swing” to speak of, and didn't “go
through with it”; and Poffles said that it was better to have his
tyle than to have none at all, like SLoguM ; and then SLogum got
riſed, and whenever PoEFLEs got in a bad place, which he did mostly
: the time, SLOGUM would go and watch him, and offer him sarcastic
Vice.
While they were slanging each other I got into more trouble, too.
I didn't know º: the next hole was, and it didn't seem to me
to matter much, so I just played about on the best grass I could find.
My caddies got tired of offering me different clubs, as I stuck to my
watching them closely enough; but, though I had not covered
myself with glory in the same way, yet I felt I had spent quite a
lively afternoon, and it would be a long time before I forgot that
game of Golf.

4,” and the “rub of the gººn. but what he was driving at I
don't know, as the green didn't seem to me to be rubbed any-
where, and if it was I hadn't done it. In fact I couldn't see
what was the matter at all, and Popries and SLoguM talked so
fast and made such a noise that I couldn't hear what they said,
so I said I should go home, as it seemed to me a silly sort of
game, in spite of the niblick, and I was fairly mad too.
We agreed to play one more hole, however, and the drive was
over a large pond. Poffles drove first, and #. beautifully
into the middle of the pond, and SLoguM did the same thing.
Then PoEFLEs said they would both drive again; which they
did, and they put two more balls into the pond, and then two
more after that. I began to think the hole must be in the
pond somewhere, but I wasn't sure. Then Porfles said he
could get the bails out if soquy would help him; and they
both got into a kind of punt, and floated out, and PoEFLEs
scraped about after the balls, while SLogum steered the punt.
ãº, Then, just as Pof FLEs was reaching after a ball, he lost his
balance, and clutched at SLogu M, and they both went wallo
into the pond together, and fought each other in the water.
didn't know if this was part of the game, but the caddies and
I enjoyed it thoroughly; and then we hauled them out, and
they were a sight for the gods.
After this we went back to the kit-cat room, and changed,
and had dinner. Poffles and SLogum were quite pleased with
themselves, and talked so much about their strokes, that I came
to the conclusion I had missed some extraordinary play by not
THAT GAME OF GOLF.
No. III.
WELL, the row being over, and the objectionable parties gone, we
continued, that is, Poffles, SLoguM, and myself. more or less
ruffled, as you may º: if you remember the scene I described in
the previous number. We managed to get through the next four holes
somehow without coming to blows, although it was wonderful what a
number of strokes it required. I saw Popples slogging away in one
place for about a quarter of an hour, swearing all the time; it was a
fort of ditch, with stones in it, and he drove every mortal thing out
of that ditch º: his ball, including about a cart-load of earth.
I couldn't think why he should choose that ditch to play in.
SLoguM was not much better; and as for my ball, it went on in
the most extraordinary way. Sometimes it went round to the left,
and sometimes to the *::: but mostly it stayed where it was, or
hopped a yard or two. One of my caddies said I ought to “take a
bit of the turf with it,” and the other said I played too much of a
cricket, stroke”; and a man who was looking on said he thought I
didn't hit hard enough, and smiled. Sometimes I got a bit mad
with it, and then I always used the niblick, and that generally
fetched it along together with some square feet of turf and a shovelful
of mud and stones.
PoEFLEs and SL9GUM argued all the time, but I couldn't under-
stand what they said. , SLogum said he didn't like Poffles’ “style”
at all; that he hadn't any “swing”, to speak of, and didn't “go
through with it”; and Poffles said that it was better to have his
style than to have none at all, like SLoguM; and then SLogu M got
riled, and whenever Poffº's got in a bad place, which he did mostly
: the time, SLOGUM would go and watch him, and offer him sarcastic
Vice.
While they were slanging each other I got into more trouble, too.
I didn't know º where the next hole was, and it didn't seem to me
to matter much, so I just played about on the best grass I could find.
My caddies got tired of offering me different clubs, as I stuck to my
watching them closely enough; but, though I had not covered
myself with glory in the same way, yet I felt I had spent quite a
lively afternoon, and it would be a long time before I forgot that
game of Golf.

Well, while I was practising with the niblick, I found a
beautiful new ball which I picked up and put in my pocket,
and not far off there was another one, which I also picked up,
and looked round to see if there were any more. Presently an
old gentleman comes up, with a flaming red face and his eyes
starting out of his head, and stutters out, “What the blank

wasn't his ball, and that I had found it. That seemed to make
him worse, and he got so mad that he couldn't speak, and
another man behind him came up and said I had better “put
the balls down and get off the green,” or he'd break my head
first and report me to the committee afterwards. Then I got
angry, and was just telling them what I thought of them, when
Pof FLEs and SLoguM came up, and said I was a fool and took
the balls away and gave them to the old gentleman; but even
that didn't satisfy him, as he kept turning back and swearing
at us at intervals as he went away, and muttering something
about losing a medal through a darned jackanapes who didn't
know a golf ball from a mushroom. The other man appeared
to be trying to console him with some remarks about “Dormie

had got into another ditch, as far as I could see, and SLogum
was showing him how to “loft” a ball out of six inches of mud.
Well, while I was practising with the niblick, I found a
beautiful new ball which I picked up and put in my pocket,
and not far off there was another one, which I also picked up,
and looked round to see if there were any more. Presently an
old gentleman comes up, with a flaming red face and his eyes
starting out of his head, and stutters out, “What the blank
blank do 3. mean by picking up my ball?” So I said it
wasn't his ball, and that I had found it. That seemed to make
him worse, and he got so mad that he couldn't speak, and
another man behind him came up and said I had better “put
the balls down and get off the green,” or he'd break my head
first and report me to the committee afterwards. Then I got
angry, and was just telling them what I thought of them, when
Pof FLEs and SLoguM came up, and said I was a fool and took
the balls away and gave them to the old gentleman; but even
that didn't satisfy him, as he kept turning back and swearing
at us at intervals as he went away, and muttering something
about losing a medal through a darned jackanapes who didn't
know a golf ball from a mushroom. The other man appeared
to be trying to console him with some remarks about “Dormie
4,” and the “rub of the gººn. but what he was driving at I
don't know, as the green didn't seem to me to be rubbed any-
where, and if it was I hadn't done it. In fact I couldn't see
what was the matter at all, and PoEFLEs and SLOGUM talked so
fast and made such a noise that I couldn't hear what they said,
so I said I should go home, as it seemed to me a silly sort of
game, in spite of the niblick, and I was fairly mad too.
We agreed to play one more hole, however, and the drive was
over a large pond. Poffles drove first, and ſº beautifully
into the middle of the pond, and SLOGUM did the same thing.
Then PoEFLEs said they would both drive again; which they
did, and they put two more balls into the pond, and then two
more after that. I began to think the hole must be in the
pond somewhere, but I wasn't sure. Then Porfles said he
cºuld get the bails out if Stogum would help him; and they
both got into a kind of punt, and floated out, and PoEFLEs
scraped about after the balls, while SLOGUM steered the punt.
B=#33: ==\º |Then, just as PoEFLEs was reaching after a ball, he lost his

I enjoyed it thoroughly; and then we hauled them out, and
they were a sight for the gods.

to the conclusion I had missed some extraordinary play by not
THAT GAME OF GOLF.
No. III.
WELL, the row being over, and the objectionable parties gone, we
continued, that is, Poffºes, SLoguM, and myself. more or less
ruffled, as you may º: if you remember the scene I described in
the previous number. We managed to get through the next four holes
somehow without coming to blows, although it was wonderful what a
number of strokes it required. I saw Poffles slogging away in one
place for about a quarter of an hour, swearing all the time; it was a
sort of ditch, with stones in it, and he drove every mortal thing out
of that ditch º his ball, including about a cart-load of earth.
I couldn’t think why he should choose that ditch to play in.
SLOGUM was not much better; and as for my ball, it went on in
the most extraordinary way. Sometimes it went round to the left,
and sometimes to the *::: but mostly it stayed where it was, or
hopped a yard or two; ...One of my caddies said I ought to “take a
bit of the turf with it,” and the other said I played “too much of a
cricket, stroke”; and a man who was looking on said he thought I
didn't hit hard enough, and smiled. Sometimes I got a bit mad
with it, and then I always used the niblick, and that generally
fetched it along together with some square feet of turf and a shovelful
of mud and stones.
PoEFLEs and SLQGUM argued all the time, but I couldn't under-
stand what they said. , SLogum said he didn't like PoEFLEs’ “style”
at all; that he hadn't any “swing” to speak of, and didn't “go
through with it”; and Poffles said that it was better to have his
; than to have none at all, like SLogum ; and then SLogum got
riled, and whenever Poffº's got in a bad place, which he did mostly
: the time, SLoguM would go and watch him, and offer him sarcastic
advice.
While they were slanging each other I got into more trouble, too.
I didn't know exactly where the next hole was, and it didn't seem to me
to matter much, so I just played about on the best grass I could find.
My caddies got tired of offering me different clubs, as I stuck to my
watching them closely enough; but, though I had not, covered
myself with glory in the same way, yet I felt I had spent quite a
lively afternoon, and it would be a long time before I forgot that
game of Golf.

niblick, so they went off and played cards under a tree. Poffles
had got into another ditch, as far as I could see, and SLoguM
was showing him how to “loft” a ball out of six inches of mud.
Well, while I was practising with the niblick, I found a
beautiful new ball which I picked up and put in my pocket,
and not far off there was another one, which I also picked up,
and looked round to see if there were any more. Presently an
old gentleman comes up, with a flaming red face and his eyes
starting out of his head, and stutters out, “What the blank
blank, do you mean by picking up my ball?” So I said it
wasn't his ball, and that I had found it. That seemed to make
him worse, and he got so mad that, he couldn't speak, and
another man behind him came up and said I had better “put
the balls down and get off the green,” or he'd break my head
first and report me to the committee afterwards. Then I got
angry, and was just telling them what I thought of them, when
Pof FLEs and SLOGUM came up, and said I was a fool and took
the balls away and gave them to the old gentleman; but even
that didn't satisfy him, as he kept turning back and swearing
at us at intervals as he went away, and muttering something
about losing a medal through a darned jackanapes who didn't
know a golf ball from a mushroom. The other man appeared
to be trying to console him with some remarks about “Dormie
4,” and the “rub of the green,” but what he was driving at I
don't know, as the green didn't seem to me to be rubbed any-
where, and if it was I hadn't done it. In fact I couldn't see
what was the matter at all, and PoEFLEs and SLogum talked so
fast and made such a noise that I couldn't hear what they said,
so I said I should go home, as it seemed to me a silly sort of
game, in spite of the niblick, and I was fairly mad too.
We agreed to play one more hole, however, and the drive was
over a large pond. PoEFLEs drove first, and got beautifully
into the middle of the pond, and SLOGUM did the same thing.
Then PoEFLEs said they would both drive again; which they
did, and they put two more balls into the pond, and then two
more after that. I began to think the hole must be in the
pond somewhere, but I wasn't sure. Then, PQFFLEs said, he
could get the bails out if Stogum would help him; and they
both got into a kind of punt, and floated out, and PoEFLEs
scraped about after the balls, while SLQGUM steered the punt.
Then, just as PoEFLEs was reaching after a ball, he lost his
balance, and clutched at SLogum, and they both went ºlº
into the pond together, and fought each other in the water.
didn't know if this was part of the game, but the caddies and
I enjoyed it thoroughly; and then we hauled them out, and
they were a sight for the gods.
After this we went back to the kit-cat room, and changed,
and had dinner. PoEFLEs and SLOGUM were quite pleased with
themselves, and talked so much about their strokes, that I came
to the conclusion I had missed some extraordinary play by not
THAT GAME OF GOLF.
No. III.
WELL, the row being over, and the objectionable parties gone, we
continued, that is, Poffſ. Es, SLOGUM, and myself. more or less
ruffled, as you may º: if you remember the scene I described in
the previous number. We managed to get through the next four holes
somehow without coming to blows, although it was wonderful what a
number of strokes it required. I saw PoffLEs slogging away in one
place for about a quarter of an hour, swearing all the time; it was a
sort of ditch, with stones in it, and he drove every mortal thing out
of that ditch except his ball, including about a cart-load of earth.
I couldn’t think why he should choose that ditch to play in.
SLOGUM was not much better; and as for my ball, it went on in
the most extraordinary way. Sometimes it went round to the left,
and sometimes to the *ś but mostly it stayed where it was, or
hopped a yard or two. One of my caddies said I ought to “take a
bit of the turf with it,” and the other said I played “too much of a
Cricket, stroke”; and a man who was looking on said he thought I
didn't hit hard enough, and smiled. Sometimes I got a bit mad
with it, and then I always used the niblick, and that generally
fetched it along together with some square feet of turf and a shovelful
of mud and stones.
PoEFLEs and SL9GUM argued all the time, but I couldn't under-
stand what they said. , SLogum said he didn't like PoEFLEs’ “style”
at all; that he hadn't any “swing” to speak of, and didn't “go
through with it”; and Poffles said that it was better to have his
; than to have none at all, like SLogum ; and then SLoguM got
riled, and whenever Poffſ. Es got in a bad place, which he did mostly
: the time, SLOGUM would go and watch him, and offer him sarcastic
Vice.
While they were slanging each other I got into more trouble, too.
I didn't know º: the next hole was, and it didn't seem to me
tº matter much, so I just played about on the best grass I could find.
My caddies got tired of offering me different clubs, as I stuck to my
watching them closely enough; but, though I had not covered
myself with glory in the same way, yet I felt I had spent quite a
lively afternoon, and it would be a long time before I forgot that
game of Golf.

THE eye of Mr. Punch, rolling as usual in

sight of nothing that makes for the great-
ness of our glorious empire, has not failed to
rest for a moment upon the special number of
the Navy League Journal for the current

abound. The most brilliant of all flash from
the editorial pages, for which the *::::
League itself is responsible. A truly noble
spirit animates, these official pages, for
although the British sailor receives the
highest praise, even the British soldier is, in
a sense, recognised as a sort of brother.
“England's soldiers are England's sons,
though their coats are red instead of blue.”
Why they should be blue is not stated. As
it is obviously by birth that both soldiers and
sailors become England's sons, it is hard
perhaps to see why it is a reproach to the
soldier to be “red instead of blue.” We
have it on high authority that the son of
Dombey was born very red, and this may
probably be some excuse for the young
soldier. But the Navy League considers that
he should be blue, and certainly the gallant
record of the Blues gives some encourage-
ment to its idea.
We pass to higher matters. “For genera-
tions past,” says, the Navy League, “the
horizon spread before the eyes of our young
manhood has been almost boundless in extent,
and the field for the exercise of their ener-
gies and for the cultivation of all the nobler
powers of the mind, almost limitless.” Surely
the grandeur of these thoughts must be appa-
rent to everyone who pays himself the com-
pliment of reading Punch! Cavillers may

The Gay Parisienne, libretto by GEORGE DANCE and music by

and CARol? With Mr. Lion EL RIGNoLD out of Drury Lane melo-
drama and pantomime, Mr. DENNY
late of the Savoy and elsewhere and
Mr. FRANK WHEELER particularly
good as a French spy (especially when
he sings in plain English, without
any trace of foreign accent), the ball
skept up. But it would come to the

to my taste. , But that it is to the taste of the public is evident, and
what’s the odds as long as the public is º:
Mr. Ivan CARYLL's music throughout is light and catchy, but I
consider that of his first act is the better. I suppose Mr. CARYLL
was compelled to do a “plantation song,” and this being so, he has
successfully introduced into it as much novelty as possible, in order
to differentiate it from other plantation songs, notably “My Honey,”
sung by MAY Yo HE. To do something new successfully in this line
is a triumph, and composer, as well as Miss ADA REEVE and chorus,
well earn the encore awarded them. As to the plot—well, there is a
plot, but you must get a detective to go with you and discover it.
The piece, which is in two acts, beginning at eight and ending at
eleven, yields a.good three hours' entertainment.of the Wariety-
Dramatio-Operatic sort. It can be renewed from time to time with
“a little song here and a little song there,” being so constructed as
to admit the introduction of any possible dance, song, speech, or
dialogue, not having the remotest connection with anything that has
gone before or anything that may follow. You come away without
a headache, without a side-ache, but, thank you, you’ve had a very
pleasant evening.

"SELECT your weapon,” said the second.
“Must I really contest this matter?” was the query the un-
fortunate principal put in reply.
“I am afraid, yes. But you have your choice. Either will do.
But one must be chosen.”
“Perhaps you can describe them,” said the unwilling principal,
anxious to time.
“With pleasure. This piece of paper is a summons. When you
have received it you will at liberty to reply. You see, you are
accused of certain actions bringing with them #. possible penalty of
heavy damages.”
“You... say “possible penalty”; perhaps there is a chance of
escape?”
“I am afraid not. You see, you depend upon counsel, judge, and
jury, and the odds are against the defendant. You may not be quite
fit when you enter the witness box, the barrister entrusted with your
cause may be ‘deviling' for a more learned and yet absent brother, the
judge may be pigheaded, and the jury obstinate. ..It is as likely as
not that the verdict may be against you, and then you will be
mulcted in damages, and have to pay two heavy bills of costs.”
“And I may be anxious for weeks?”
“Don’t stop at weeks—say months. You will go through tortures
of doubt and mistrust. And, until it is all over, you will never be
able to call your banking account your own.”
“And the alternative?” demanded the principal.
“Oh, that is simple enough. It is a German custom. You stand at
so many paces distant-and fire. You may certainly find it awkward;
but then you are saved from a good deal of agitation and suspense.”
The yet reluctant quarreller paused. He glanced first at the
paper, and then at the firearm.
“Give me the pistol,” he said, at length.
“I think you have decided wisely,” replied his second.
And the admission was all the more remarkable, as the last
speaker was a solicitor. And not only remarkable, but reprehensible.

THE SPRING CLEANING.
By TooHARD TiPPLING,
(Copyright in Newington Butts, 1896.)
THERE was a spirit of restlessness abroad among the Bungle
People. The males looked at each other uneasily, but spake not,
wandering hither and thither aimlessly,
while their customary cheerfulness was
replaced by a gloom—a heavy, dreadful
gloom. Indeed, it was as though Fear
had spread the shadow of his terrible
wings over them. They were cowed, if
not crushed, taking no interest in any-
thing; even their betting-books remained
unopened; the races tempted them not;
and the jovial Bukmahkrs mourned. They
assembled in the Klubb. Groves—where
they were wont to resort for noisy discus-
sion of Bungle matters, or for abuse of
their common enemy, the monster Inkum-
taks—and consulted together awe-struck
and in whispers. Only PAH PHAMILIAs
once raised his voice to exclaim, in bitter
anguish, “Alas! alas! my poor brethren,
IT is upon us; let us resign ourselves to
the annual season of woe.” And a general
n followed. Some, courting slumber,
uried their heads in the luxurious leaves. -
of the Times Tree; others sought solace in copious draughts from
the exhilarating Beeaness Brook which fizzed near at hand. -
Now MAH PHAMILIAs and all those of her sex became *...";
busy, and assumed airs, of the utmost importance. No longer, did
they treat the better-half with usual tenderness and consideration;
but made his home uninhabitable, driving him from corner to corner
till he knew not where he was. For it was the season when the
Female, with her 'Ousemayds and Pahlamayds, is allowed by the
inexorable laws of Bungle to have full power over her consort and
his habitation. During the time of the Spring Cleaning she is
supreme; and none may, gainsay...her. All the man population of
Bungle suffered alike. “Mimsy” and forlorn they remained long
hours in the Klubb Groves; but the Bhilyards were lonesome; only
the Brook bubbled on. Once PAH PHAMILIAs actually forgot the sad-
ness of the season. Joyfully howling the songs of his youth, he
returned to his lair long after the Mylk. Bird—whose shriek is a
terror—had passed upon its rounds...And MAH PHAMILIAs—who, like
the rest of her tribe, loathed the Klubb Groves, fearing the fasci-
nating, influence of the Beeaness. Brook, and would have had
them destroyed—was very wroth with him, upbraid him for a
“heartless wretch, to come home at that hour; and wasn't he
ashamed of himself?” But, PAH PHAMILIAs only smiled vaguely;
and murmured, “Sprinclean’.” Then he stumbled upstairs. And
how he suffered the next day, and found the season of the Spring
Cleaning more trying than ever must serve for yet another story.
According to That HAPPY WOYAGER SIR EDWIN ARNOLD,

There is no pique at Teneriffe.

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
SPRING IN OUR WILLAGE,
In the beautiful weather that Heaven has sent us during these last
days Spring has indeed been rushing in upon us with Summer bear-
ing her train... Where only, lately gaunt, and forbidding boughs
tossed sorrowfully in the bleak winds, and the hedgerows were bare
and black, there has come, first, a timid glint of delicate green, and
then a glorious effnigence the orchards have taken on their
shimmering white robes, and velvet lawns, unparched as yet by any
fierce heat, invite the casual saunterer. Life itself seems to have
º: away all effort, and resigns itself in calm contentment to the cool
reath of the morning breeze.
HERE, in our quiet village, we seem to have made up our minds to
bask and enjoy ourselves. Existence with us lies apart from the

obedience to the alarmed authorities of our county, but for the most
part, as I say, we bask and enjoy ourselves, and feel the stir of spring
in our veins without, any furious desire to burst away from the easy
trammels of our little conventions. Yet it is certainly strange that
the dwellers in cities coming for a day or two into our remoteness do
not always see and hear as we do. It was only the other day that
my friend Payge-LystER. (guard yourself carefully, if you wish for
his goodwill, from substituting an “i” for a “y” in his name),
who had come to me for a breath of country air, arrived in the break-
fast-room on his first morning here with a haggard and desperate
expression, “My dear GroRGº,” ſaid I, with some concern, “what
is the matter with you?...You look, as if you hadn't slept a wink.”
“Slept!” he answered, bitterly; “how the deuce, is a man to sleep
of the night, and two confounded larks howl and scream
outside al the time?” .* which he lº morosely
into his correspondence from the City, and, only broke his
silence to say he feared that business would call him back
earlier than he had anticipated.
I SAw the father of the village sunning himself outside his
garden-gate yesterday. How this venerable old gentleman
acquired the parental position which our universal consent, has
assigned to him, I have never been able to discover; for there
are in the village men who have not only lived there longer,
but are older in years. No doubt the possession of his little
freehold counts for ‘...."; and a certain old-world courtli-
ness of manner, a hearty friendliness bearing .# gallantly
under the weight of age, a fº. address, a nice conduct of the
sturdy stick that supports his steps—all these have their influ-
ence. Whatever be the cause, he is acknowledged as the father
of the village. It is rumoured of him that he is an Oxford
man, and that he once wrote a book. For myself, I have never
ventured either to doubt or to inquire into these statements... I
accept them as part of the atmosphere in which a father of a
village should move and have his being. The salutations we
exchange, though always friendly, have never declined into
a flippant familiarity. “Good morning, Mr. JACKSON; how
leasant these warm mornings are.” “That they are, Sir:
it’s a God's blessing to be able to move about again without
being frozen.” “I trust Mrs. JAckson is better.” “Thank
you, Sir, she is no worse; we hope that the coming summer
may bring her back to health,” Such in the past has been the
manner of our brief interviews.
BUT on this particular morning I hesitated to approach the
kindly old gentleman, for the cold winds of March had broken
down his invalid wife's resistance, and ten days before she had
been carried to her rest in our little churchyard. Since then I
had not seen him, for he had shut himself up in his home to
mourn over his loss, and no one had dared to disturb his sorrow,
However, I judged he would not resent a friendly word, so I
him. “Mr. JACKson,” I began, “I was deepl

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PLAYING “YORKERS.”
The Gay Parisienne, libretto by GEORGE DANCE and music by
Ivan CARYLL. What combination of names in connection with the
authorship of a musical piece could be happier than those of DANCE
and CARol? With Mr. LIONEL RIGNOLD out of Drury Lane melo-
drama and pantomime, Mr. DENNY
late of the Savoy and elsewhere, and
Mr. FRANK WHEELER particularly
good as a French spy (especially when
he sings in plain English, without
any trace of foreign accent), the ball
skept up. But it would come to the
ground were it not for the sprightly
Miss ADA REEVE singing and dancing
as the Gay Parisienne, quite the
ideal of “perpetual, motion,” and
the fascinations of the fascinating
daughter of the Major, represented
by Miss WIoIETELLIcott. Then the
stately Miss EDITH STUART, and other
ladies, who can act a little, sing a
little, dance a little, and do generally
verywell a little of everything, all con-
tribute towards the general success.
Besides, there is that extraordinary
little person, Miss LouTE FREEAE,
representing a maid-of-all-work with
plenty of F. and reminding every-
one forcibly of Hºnor K. Blowº’s
goblinesque presentment of the Mar-
chioness, who, after being bullied and
starved by the Brasses, was finally
washed, costumed, and made pre-
sentable in order to become Mrs.
Swiveller. Miss Louſe FREEAR's
eccentricities have “caught on,” and
the house, without exception,
applauds to the echo, and redemands
five times over this queer little lady's
The “New Wºº at the Duke "ß
o' York’s. performance I find myself in a dis-
tinct minority. But then, I have the bad taste not to be amused by
“LITTLE TIGH,” let him do his very quaintest. And though Miss
FREEAR is by no means a LTTTLE TIGH, yet there is something
uncanny and goblinesque about her in this “make-up” which is not
to my taste. But that it is to the taste of the public is evident, and
what’s the odds as long as the public is happy?
Mr. Ivan CARYLL's music throughout is light and catchy, but I
consider that of his first act is the better. I suppose Mr. CARYLL
was compelled to do a “plantation song,” and this being so, he has
successfully introduced into it as much novelty as tº in order
to differentiate it from other plantation songs, notably “My Honey,”
sung by MAY Yoh E. To do something new successfully in this line
is a triumph, and composer, as well as Miss ADA REEVE and chorus,
well earn the encore awarded them. As to the plot-well, there is a
plot, but you must get a detective to go with you and discover it.
The piece, which is in two acts, beginning at eight and ending at
eleven, yields a.good three hours' entertainment.of the Variety-
Dramatic-Operatic sort. It can be renewed from time to time with
“a little song here and a little song there,” being so constructed as
to admit the introduction of any possible dance, song, speech, or
dialogue, not having the remotest connection with anything that has
gone before or anything that may follow. , You come away without
a headache, without a side-ache, but, thank you, you’ve had a very
pleasant evening.

“SELECT your weapon,” said the second.
“Must I really contest this matter?” was the query the un-
fortunate principal put in reply.
“I am afraid, yes. But you have your choice. Either will do.
But one must be chosen.”
“Perhaps you can describe them,” said the unwilling principal,
anxious to gain time.
“With pleasure. This piece of paper is a summons. When you
have received it you will be at liberty to reply. You see, you are
accused of certain actions bringing º them #. possible penalty of
hº damages.” .
“You... say “possible penalty”; perhaps there is a chance of

“I am afraid not. You see, you depend upon counsel, judge, and
jury, and the odds are against the defendant. You may not be quite
fit when you enter the witness box, the barrister entrusted with your
cause may be “deviling’ for a more learned and yet absent brother, the
judge may be pigheaded, and the jury obstinate. ..It is as likely as
not that the verdict may be against you, and then you will be
mulcted in damages, and have to pay two heavy bills of costs.”
“And I may be anxious for weeks?”
“Don’t stop at weeks—say months. You will go through tortures
of doubt and mistrust. And, until it is all over, you will never be
able to call your banking account your own.”
“And the alternative?” demanded the principal.
“Oh, that is simple enough. It is a German custom. You stand at
so many paces distant—and fire. You may certainly find it awkward;
but then you are saved from a good deal of agitation and suspense"
The yet reluctant quarreller paused. He glanced first at the
paper. and then at the firearm.
* Give me the pistol,” he said, at length,
“I think you have decided wisely,” replied his second.
And the admission was all the more remarkable, as the last
speaker was a solicitor. And not only remarkable, but reprehensible.
Of course regarding the matter from a professional point of view.
THE SPRING CLEANING.
By TooHARD Tippling.
(Copyright in Newington Butts, 1896.)
THERE was a spirit of restlessness abroad among the Bungle
People. The males looked at each other uneasily, but spake not,
wandering hither and thither aimlessly,
while their customary cheerfulness was
replaced by a gloom—a heavy, dreadful
gloom. Indeed, it was as though Fear
had spread the shadow of his terrible
wings over them. They were cowed, if
not crushed, taking no interest in any-
thing; even their betting-books remained
unopened; the races tempted them not;
and the jovial Bukmahkrs mourned. They
assembled in the Klubb Groves—where
they were wont to resort for noisy discus-
sion of Bungle matters, or for abuse of
their common enemy, the monster Inkum-
taks—and consulted together awe-struck
and in whispers. Only PAH PHAMILIAs
once raised his voice to exclaim, in bitter
anguish, “Alas! alas! my poor brethren,
IT is upon us; let us resign ourselves to
the annual season of woe.” And a general
roan followed. Some, courting slumber,
uried their heads in the luxurious leaves. -
of the Times Tree; others, sought solace in copious draughts from
the exhilarating Beeaness Brook which fizzed near at hand.
Now MAH PHAMILIAs and all those of her sex became exceedingly
busy, and assumed airs of the utmost importance. No longer did
they treat the better-half with usual tenderness and consideration;
but made his home uninhabitable, driving him from corner to corner
till he knew not where he was. For it was the season when the
Female, with her 'Ousemayds and Pahlamayds, is allowed by the
inexorable laws of Bungle to have full power over her consort and
his habitation. During the time of the Spring Cleaning she is
supreme; and none may gainsay her. All the man population of
Bungle suffered alike. “ #. and forlorn they remained long
hours in the Klubb Groves; but the Bhilyards were lonesome; only
the Brook bubbled on. Once PAH PHAMILIAs actually forgot the sad-
ness of the season. Joyfully howling the songs of his youth, he
returned to his lair long after the Mylk. Bird—whose shriek is a
terror—had º: upon its rounds...And MAH PHAMILIAs—who, like
the rest of her tribe, loathed the Klubb Groves, fearing the fasci-
nating influence of the Beeaness. Brook, and would have had
them destroyed—was very wroth with him, upbraiding him for a
“heartless wretch to come home at that hour; and wasn't he
ashamed of himself?” But, PAH PHAMILIAs only smiled vaguely;
and murmured, “Sprinclean’.” Then he stumbled upstairs. And
how he suffered the next day, and found the season of the Spring
Cleaning more trying than ever must serve for yet another story.

O GRAssE, I thought that thou wast sweet,
So sweet to eye and nose alikel
I started, eager for the treat, , .
By train much slower than a bike.
Thy train from charming Cannes I see
Is meant, by its delay, to call
Attention to the fact that we
Had better never go at all.
I climbed thy hill, as I was told
Thy view was marvellously fine;
Thy barracks, frightful to behold,
ould spºil a view much more divine.
I saw thy dusty, dismal streets,
Thy graceless church, and then I went
To see the sweetest of thy sweets,
A manufactory of scent.
Alas, sweet perfumes of the rose
Or lily I had not to face!
An oily smell assailed my nose.
The scent of Grasse is scent of graisse.
O dusty, evil-smelling town,
O grassless, graceless Grasse, all graisse,
I do not want to run thee down
But thou art not a pleasant place !
Then, luckless wretch, quite bored by thee,
I sought thy station to await
Thy train, which always seems to be
Three quarters of an hour late.
One moment's joy was mine that day;
It was when thy belated train,
0 Grasse, at last took me away!
I never shall come back again!

THE MOUNTED PEDESTRIAN'8
WADE MECUM.
(Compiled by a Prejudiced Pro-
menader who Objects to Cycles in
the Park.)
Question. Is the new manner
of riding in the Drive attractive?
Answer. inly not; as the
up-to-date velocipedist seldom
possesses grace, and nearly in-
variably lacks comfort.
Q. Is there not constantly an
expression of care upon the
countenances of cyclists?
A. Very frequently; and this
aspect would cause mirth, did it
#. suggest approaching afflic-
101.
Q. What is the meaning of
a “spill” to a votary of the
wheel?
A. Any upset; from the first,
requiring the services of a
medical student, to the last,
demanding the recognition of a
00roner.
Q. Does a male rider appear
to advantage mountedon wheels?
A. Never; and when he scales
fourteen stone or more, the pic-
ture he presents is pitiable.
Q. Does a lady-rider who
takes her hands from the guid-
ing-iron and progresses solely
with the assistance of her feet
deserve commendation?
A. Distinctly not; as her per-
formance invites disaster, and
is merely suggestive of the pre-
liminary antics of an “extra
turn” at a fourth-rate music-
hall.
Q. Should a general-officer
ride a cycle?
A. Not within view of the
barracks, as no sentry could
salute him with a feeling of
sincere respect.

No one would like to have missed, peroration to-night in #.
introducing Agricultural Rating Bill. . It came a little suddenly
after matter-of-fact lucid explanation of details of Bill. But how
full-toned it was ; how rotund; how reminiscent of Dizzy, just now,

faded primroses with sardonic smile on the gaping crowd that blocks

as you say, a touch of the antique ||||||||IHH!Tºulºſ,

dubiously at SARK.

Thursday,+Dr. TANNER is be-
ginning to think there's something
uncanny about the SPEAKER, Long
practice has enabled him to wrestle with Chair, whether it be filled
by SPEAKER or Chairman, But he likes business conducted according
to ordinary rules of the ring.
“I don't mind being occasionally suspended,” he said. ... “It

spending eight hours at the sea-side. Also, I have grown accustomed
to being ordered to resume my seat just when, after a quarter of an
hour's gabble, I am beginning to approach my subject. , Moreover,
it is quite common for a motion to be declared carried when I have
for some moments bawled out."No!' Those are ordinary expe-
riences of a Member of my legislative habits. But when half-a-
dozen fellows jump up to second an amendment, to have the
SPEAKER fix upon you in particular as the seconder, and when
half an hour later, you come in prepared with a speech that shall
further block business, for him to say you have already spoken—
well, now, that's what I call hitting below the belt.”
Incident certainly a little hard upon Member of TANNER's indus-
trious habits... Motion before House was that Grand Committee on
Law, might sit till four o'clock, instead of observing usual practice
of adjourning in time for meeting of House. Benefices Bill has

been shouting.

“Several Members rose, and I took the seconding of the hon.
Mamber;” and the SPEAKER forthwith put the question.
TANNER temporarily subsided; House roared with laughter; at
least a quarter of an hour of precious time saved.
Business done.-Budget resolutions agreed to.
Friday.—Member for South Monaghan consumed with thirst for
ſºft knowledge. Whenever, Carrick:
; macross can spare the Chairman of
its Town Commissioners, he cymes
up to Westminster, and floods
paper with questions. In the Chief
Secretary's office he is known as
The ... Daly Inquirer. Amongst
questions in to-day's paper stand-
ing in his name is one “to ask the
; Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieu-
tenant of Ireland if he is aware
that national school teachers have,
out of their own pockets, to supply
maps, tablets, school pictures, and
charts.”
Assuming question is based on
fact, here is fresh injustice to
Ireland. Why should national
school teachers in that country be
thus inconveniently loaded ? Some
i of them, SABK tells me, live long
distances frºm scene of their ſº
i bours; have to trudge to and fro
i daily. Why should they be re-
quired to bulge forth their pockets
with maps, tablets, school pictures,
and charts ready to meet capri-
cious demand of school-children?
The form of Mr. 1)ALY's ques-
tion suggests a way out ºf the
difficulty. As he puts it, it is
“out of their own pockets” the
hapless teachers have to procure
these articles, some of them (charts
and school pictures) of considerable
bulk. There might someone
else's pocket out of which they
might take them ; the county
Member's or the Chairman of the
Town Commissioners', for example.
But that obviously only modifica-
tion of a º that really seems
arbitrarily created. In England or
Scotland the schoolroom would be fitted up with cupboards or drawers
in which these indispensable articles might be stored, to be drawn
upon in case of need. The Member for South Monaghan has called
attention to a real grievance, which GERALD BALFour, still anxious
to kill Home Rule by kindness, will do well to remove.
Business done.—Scotch Wotes in Committee of Supply.

AN APRIL SHOWER.
SweeT BAB and I
Sat under a tree.
Oh, blue was the sky
And the wind blew free.
Our cheeks were close.
But she little heeded;
Hers flushed like a rose.
Mine paled, as I pleaded
For-maybe you’ll guess.
Ah! bad luck is a bore.
Had I but said less,
Qr, perhaps, done more,
All had yet been well.
But-my chance was gone;
The free wind fell,
And the rain came on.
She sighed “It thunders!”
I hadn't a “brolly.”
Alas for the blunders
Of human folly!
I huffed, she tiffed ;
How the rain did pelt!
I frowned, she sniffed.
Ah! she would not melt.
Her eyes of blue,
Like the sky, were veiled.
Such chill showers, too!
One had sworn it hailed,
I hailed—a cab.
Dull, dreary, damp,
We sulked. Sweet BAB |
For the lack of a gamp,
I lost that kiss
And thee, too, alackl
The chance we miss
Comes never more back.
Rain, soft Spring rain l
As you wet the leaves,
With repentance vain
One broods and grieves.
And the other? Faith !
She is rich and †:
And she shows small scathe;
Yet methinks to-day,
When by chance we met
In the lime-tree walk,
With the small rain wet,
That, though blithe our talk,
She felt, as I,
The malignant power
Of a word awry,
And an April shower.
AS IT MAY BE.
[“. . . . . a solution of the difficulty might, perhaps, be found in empan-
nelling, at a reasonable rate of remuneration, some of the unemployed
members of the Junior Bar as special jurors.”—Daily Press.]
Mr. Justice Jawley (summing up case to jury of Barristers). In
deciding upon the momentous issues involved in the case now before
you, 5.º. it will be for you, in the first place, to say—
A Juror (rising in the bor). Pardon me, my Lord, it will be for
you, in the first place, to say whether you intend to hold that the
communication made by A. to B. is privileged or not. (Slight
applause from rest of panel.)
Mr. Justice Jawley (rather taken aback). I–er—well, you see,
gentlemen, I-I was coming to that in due course; but if you
prefer me to deal with it now, I may tell you that there is a case
which settles the law upon that point conclusively. In Tomkyns v.
Trout it was laid down by no less an authority than Mr. Justice—
Foreman of the Jury (interrupting). Your Lordship is evidently
unaware that Tomkyns v. Trout—which I may mention for your
Lordship's guidance is reported in 10 Queen's Bench Division,
page 392—has since been over-ruled in the Court of Appeal, see
2 Appeal Cases, New Series, page 1263.
Mr. Justice Jawley (rubbing his spectacles, nervously). Oh
indeed, indeed-er—yes-thank you very much. I had overlooked
that, but I dare say the Foreman of the jury is quite right. Well,
then-let me see-where was I? Oh, yes, I remember. This action
is one brought for the express purpose—
Another Juryman. Pardon the interruption, my Lord, but my col-
leagues in the box and myself are all agreed that it would be sheer
waste of time to go into that matter, and travel all over the same
ground again. We know perfectly well what the action is all about.
We are only waiting to know if your Lordship has any new light to
throw upon the subject. We do not suppose you have. Still, we are
willing to wait and see.
Mr. Justice Jawley. I-I thank you. The question of privilege
is, of course, one for me to decide, and I have no hesitation in hold-
ing that, on the authority of Baker v. Johnson—
A Juror (from the back of the bor). Then what about Somers
v. Smart P. . .
His Lordship. Really, really, gentlemen, this is most irregular.
If you will kindly permit me to sum º this case in the ordinary
way—thank you. Perhaps I had better first deal with the testimony
given by the witness C. He is a clerk in the employ of the Plaintiff,
and what he says, in effect is this, that on receipt of the
Foreman of the Jury. We need not trouble your Lordship on that
point. It would not in any case be evidence against the Defendant.
Mr. Justice Jawley (surprised). But if his act was within the
scope of his authority—
Foreman (imperturbably). It wasn't. It was ultra vires. See
Bryce, }. 1408, -
His Lordship (bursting into tears). Then, perhaps, Gentlemen
you had better take this matter entirely into your own hands; f
seem to be quite superfluous here.
Foreman (in kindly tones); Oh, I don't know that... Your Lord-

Perhaps we had better settle the matter without wou.

NOTES OF AN AFTERNOON'S “AMUSEMENT.”
... WIND blowing a hurricane, with occasional heavy showers. Still,
it won't, do not to appear at the “meet” of the bicycle paper-chase
in which the Jon Esks have asked me to take part. Accordingly,
mount my machine and ride through three miles of mud. Find
about two dozen riders assembled at the
meet, including four or five ladies; like-
wise a crowd of rustics, who greet each
fresh arrival with loud cheers and personal
remarks. Some delay in starting the
hares. There were to have been an 'are
and 'aress, but the latter declines to go
so a gentleman takes her place. At last
the hares ride off amid a whirlwind of
scraps of paper. Ten minutes' “law” to
be given them—great excitement. Forty-
five seconds before we are to start, Miss
BROWN asks me kindly to inflate her tyre
for her. Refuse firmly. Starter drops a
flag, and a seething mass of bicycles rushes
headlong downhi Can only escape col-
lision by a miracle. Miss Brown charges
straight for my hind-wheel. Elude her,
and in so doing nearly knock over several
others. More bumps from behind, Wish. that I had one of the
insurance-newspapers in my F. expecting every minute to be
smashed up. However, we all get away somehow.
Road going uphill now, with gale full in our faces, should like to
walk up this hill, but too proud to do so., Glance at the faces of my
fellow-"hounds” nearest me. They don't look as if they were enjoying
themselves. One unknown gentleman wastes his breath in talking to
his bike as if it were a horse, “Come up, you beast. . . Would you,
then. . . Come up, confound you.” Justin front is a curate, with a
yery high stiff white collar; as we proceed, collar gets gradually limper.
Still going uphill, Wind worsethan ever. Begin to wish to exchange
present position for a nice comfortable treadmill. Someone asks me
if I have “seen any scent.” Tell him not to be a fool. Afterwards
discover that the paper dropped by the hares is called “scent.” . . .
Still going uphill. "Ask a rustic whether he has seen the hares.
Idiot answers, “Naw, an’naw rabbuts neither.” Reach cross-roads.
Which way are we to turn ? Refuse to ride against this wind any
longer, and so make off to the right. Presently find that right is
wrong, and have to come back again. Why, everyone has stopped—
has anyone been killed P. No, the hares have been caught. "Fresh
pair despatched. Stragglers come º from behind. Everyone dis-
mounts, and says what a delightful ride we are having, Wish I
knew the way home. - --
Off again, still uphill. “Hounds” go off in every direction,
intending, I expect, to sneak home. Suddenly the chain of one
machine breaksin half, with surprising results. Another gentleman
takes a corner to) sharply, comes down and cuts himself badly. In-
terval for refreshment and bandages. Only four of us together by
this time, the rest scattered all over the county, trying to find their
way home. The hares, as we learn subsequently, almost kill them-
selves by racing for about twenty miles, laying elaborate false tracks,
and riding at their utmost speed. As a matter of fact, no one at all
is now F. them. Those of us whose machines haven't been
smashed up ride slowly home. The remains of one are left at the
nearest house, to be forwarded by Parcel Post., Am nearly killed
by my companion mistaking her right hand for her left on the way
home. However, we get back at last, and the rest straggle in at
intervals. Then we drink to the success cf the glorious sport of
bicycle paper-chasing.

DEAREST ETHELINDA, Your reproaches are not wholly reasonable.
I have been silent because I flatter myself that I am not an idle

colleagues, who think nothing of intruding themselves unbidden
into circles with which they have neither scot nor lot. There is Mrs.
FROUFROU-DABB, for instance, of The Grand Duchess (her nom de
lume is “Sweet Seventeen,” though to my certain knowledge she
as worn a toupet for a quarter of a century), she presented herself
at the Countess of CoCKALEEKIE's reception the other night without
having received the necessary card of invitation, and by her Fouché-
like proceedings was enabled to give a tolerably correct account of
the toilettes which foregathered. But how she could have been
deceived by Lady SHUTTLºcock's tiara cf false diamonds passes my
understanding l It is well known that the real stones have for long
been in the custody of that eminent judge of gems Mr. MEDICI
Konk, most of whose unredeemed pledges of misplaced confidence
are well worth the attention of artistic connaisseurs. On my last
visit to his establishment (I, of course, did not wish to consult him
professionally) I was especially attracted by—" However, to
revert to Mrs. FROUFROU-GABB, I can only suppose that sooner or

removed from some fashionable assembly by one of those chasseurs

out”) who guard the portals of the stately homes of England.
“BLABETTE,” of The Peri–her real name is MARY ANNE

Mrs. DABB, only her method is quite different. . Mrs. F. D. (quelle

early and so rapid, that the likeness was produced with only half a

during the operation. This deficiency allows the future comedian to
exhibit more cheek than would have been otherwise shown; and this,
perhaps, may be characteristic.

wise a crowd of rustics, who greet each
fresh arrival with loud cheers and personal
remarks. Some delay in starting the
hares. There were to have been an 'are
and 'aress, but the latter declines to go
so a gentleman takes her place. At last
the hares ride off amid a whirlwind of
scraps of ºr. Ten minutes' “law” to
be given them—great excitement. Forty-
five seconds before we are to start, Miss
BROWN asks me kindly to inflate her tyre ".
for her. Refuse firmly. Starter drops a ſº
flag, and a seething mass of bicycles rushes
headlong downhi Can only escape col-
lision by a miracle. Miss BRowN charges
straight for my hind-wheel. Elude her,
and in so doing nearly knock over several 2
others. More bumps from behind, Wish. that I had one of the
insurance-newspapers in my F. expecting every minute to be
smashed up. However, we all get away somehow. -
Road going uphill now, with gale full in our faces, should like to
walk up this hill, but too proud to do so., Glance at the faces of my
fellow-"hounds” nearest me. They don'tlook as if they were enjoying
themselves. One unknown gentleman wastes his breath in talking to
his bike as if it were a horse, “Come up, you beast. . . Would you,
then, ; ; Come tºp, confound you.” Justin front is a curate, with a
yery high stiff white collar; as we proceed, collar gets gradually limper.
Still going uphill, Wind worsethan ever. Begin to wish to exchange
present position for a nice comfortable treadmill. Someone asks me
if I have “seen any scent.” Tell him not to be a fool. Afterwards
discover that the paper dropped by the hares is called “scent.” . . .
Still going uphill. "Ask a rustic whether he has seen the hares.
Idiot answers, “Naw, an' naw rabbuts neither.” Reach cross-roads.
Which way are we to turn ? Refuse to ride against this wind any
longer, and so make off to the right. Presently find that right is
wrong, and have to come back again. Why, everyone has stopped—
has anyone been killed? No, the hares have been caught. "Fresh
pair despatched. Stragglers come º from behind. Everyone dis-
mounts, and says what a delightful ride we are having, Wish I
knew the way home.
Off again, still uphill.
“Hounds” go off in every direction,
intending, I expect, to sneak home. Suddenly the chain of one
machine breaksin half, with surprising results. Another gentleman
takes a corner to) sharply, comes down and cuts himself badly. In-
terval for refreshment and bandages. Only four of us together by
this time, the rest scattered all over the county, trying to find their
way home. The hares, as we learn subsequently, almost kill them-
selves by racing for about twenty miles, laying elaborate false tracks,
and riding at their utmost speed. As a matter of fact, no one at all
is now pursuing them. Those of us whose machines haven't been
smashed up ride slowly home. The remains of one are left at the
nearest house, to be forwarded by Parcel Post., Am nearly killed
by my companion mistaking her º: hand for her left on the way
home. However, we get back at last, and the rest straggle in at
intervals. Then we drink to the success cf the glorious sport of
bicycle paper-chasing.

DEAREST ETHELINDA, -Your reproaches are not wholly reasonable.
I have been silent because I flatter myself that I am not an idle
tittle-tattler. Mon terre n'est pas grand, mais je bois dans mon
verre. In a word, I am not chiffonnière to the extent of some of my
colleagues, who think nothing of intruding themselves unbidden
into circles with which they have neither scot nor lot. There is Mrs.
FROUFRou-DABB, for instance, of The Grand Duchess (her nom de
f.". is “Sweet Seventeen,” though to my certain knowledge she
as worn a toupet for a quarter of a century), she presented herself
at the Countess of CoCKALEEKIE's reception the other night without
having received the necessary card of invitation, and by her Fouché-
like proceedings was enabled to give a tolerably correct account of
the toilettes which foregathered. But how she could have been
deceived by Lady SHUTTLEcock's tiara of false dismonds passes my
understanding 1 It is well known that the real stones have for long
been in the custody of that eminent judge of gems Mr. MEDICI
Konk, most of whose unredeemed pledges of misplaced confidence
are well worth the attention of artistic connaisseurs. On my last
visit to his establishment (I, of course, did not wish to consult him
professionally) I was especially attracted by—" However, to
revert to Mrs. FROUFROU-GABB, I can only suppose that sooner or
later she will reap the reward of her outrecuidance, and be forcibly
removed from some fashionable assembly by one of those chasseurs

out”) who guard the portals of the stately homes of England.
“BLABETTE,” of The Peri–her real name is MARY ANNE
WINKLE – is, to my mind, quite as impertinently obtrusive as is
Mrs. DABB, only her method is quite different. . Mrs. F. D. (quelle
décadence de nom () is a sort of female, Prince RUPERT, and
charges into the ranks of Society on the slightest provocation; Miss
WINKLE subdues opposition by the feigned artlessness of the in-

acquaintance with the great and omnipotent. She began by in-

JOTTINGS AND TITTLINGS.
(By BABoo HURRY BuNgsHo JABBERJRR, B.A.)
No. XII.
Mr. Jabberjee is taken by surprise.
DITIgENT perusers of my lucubrations to Punch will remember
that I have devoted sundry jots and tittles to the subject of Miss
JessiºnAMANKLETow; and already may have concluded that I was
long since up to the hilt in the tender passion. . In this deduction,
however, they would have manufactured a stentorian cry from an
extreme paucity of wool; the actual fact being that, although
rcipient of the well-proportionate symmetry of her person and the
#. liveliness of her deportment, I did never regard her except
with eyes of strictly platonic philandering and calf love.
It is true that, at certain
seasons, the ostentatious
favours, she would squander
upon other young m line
ers in my presence did
reduce me to the doleful
dump of despair, so that
even the birds and beasts of
forest shed tears at my
misery, and i. at
meal-times I have sought to
move her to compassion by
neighing like horse, or by
the incessant rolling of my
visual organs; though she
did only attribute such ad
misericordiam appeals to the
excessive avity of ... the
cheese, or the immaturity of
the rhubarb pie.
But I was then a labourer
under the impression that I
was the odd man out of her
affections, and it is well
known that, to a sensitive,
it is intolerable to feel that
oneself is not the object of
adoration, even to one to
whom we may entertain but
a mediocre attraction:
On a recent evening we
had a tête-d-tête which cul-
minated in the utter surprise.
It was the occasion of our
hebdomadal dancing- º
at Porticobello House, and
had solicited her to become
a co-partner with myself in
the maziness of a waltz;
but, not being the carpet-
knight, and consequentl
treading the measure wit
too great frequency upon the
toes of my fair auxiliary,
she suggested a temporary
withdrawal from circulation.
To which I assenting, she
conducted me to a landin
whereon was a small glaze
apartment, screened by hang- - -
ings and furnished with a H. of unproductive pots, which is
styled the conservatory, and here we did sit upon two wicker-worked
chairs, and for a while were mutually sotto voce.
Presently I, remarking with, corner of eye the sumptuousness of
her appearance, and the *. indifference of her demeanour,
which made it seem totally improbable that she should ever, like
Desdemona, seriously incline to treat me as an Othello, commenced
to heave the sighs of a fire-stove, causing Miss JESSIMINA to accuse
me of desiring myself in India.
I denied this with native hyperbolism, º that I was content
, and that the con-
to remain in statu quo until the doom crack
servatory was for me the equivalent of Paradise.
She replied that its similitude to Paradise would be more
#. if a larger proportion of the pots had contained plants, and
Buo

*...** but she had refused to run for such adornments.
“I became once more the silent tomb.”
lants as there were had not fallen into such a lean and
stage of decrepitude, adding that she did perpetually urge
- I, with spontaneous gallantry, retorted that she was justified
illumination, and upon her cheeks was a bloom brighter than many
geraniums. But this compliment she unhappily mistook as an in:
sinuation that her complexion was of meretricious composition, and
seeing that I had put my foot into a cul-de-sac, I became once more
the silent tomb, and exhaled sighs at intervals.
Presently she declared once more that she saw, from the dullness
of my expression, that I was longing for the luxurious magnificence
of my Indian palace.
Now my domestic abode, though a respectable spacious sort of
residence, and containing my father, mother, married brothers, &c.,
§ with a few antique unmarried aunts, is not at all of a
palatial architecture; but it is a bad bird that blackens his own
nest, and so I merely answered that I was now so saturated with
Western civilisation, that I had lost all taste for Oriental splendours.
.Next she inquired whether I did not miss the tiger-shooting and
pig-sticking; and I replied (with veraciousness, since I am not the
au fait in such sports) that I
could not deny a liability to
miss both tigers and pigs,
and, indeed, all animals that
were ferae naturae, and she
condemned the hazardous-
ness of these jungle sports,
and wished, me, to promise
that I would abstain from
them on my return to India.
To this I replied that be-
fore I agreed to such a self-
denying ordinance, I desired
to be more convinced of the
sincerity of her interest in
the E. of my
humble existence.
Miss JEssIMINA asked
what had she done that I
should be in dubitation as
to her bona fides f
Then I did meekly remind
her of her flirtatious pref-
erences for the young -
witted London chaps, and
her incertitude and disdain-
ful capriciousness towards
myself, who was not a beetle-
head or an obtuse, but a
cultivated native gentleman
with high-class university
degree, and an oratorical
flow of language which was
infallibly to land me upon
the pinnacle of some tip-top
judicial preferment in the
Calcutta High Court of
Justice.
She made the excuse that
she was compelled by finan-
cial reasons to be pleasant to
the male boarders, and that
I cruld notexpectany marked
favouritism so long as I kept
my tongue concealed inside
my damask cheek like a
worm in bud.
Upon which, transported
by uncºntrollable emotion, I
ventured to embrace her,
assuring her that she was the cynosure of my ºf eyes,
and supplied the vacuum and long-felt want of my soul, and while
occupied in imprinting a chaste salute upon her rosebud lips—who'd
have thought it! her severe matronly parent popped in through the
curtains and, surveying me with a cold and basilican eye, did demand
my intentions.
or can I tell what I should have †. seeing that I had
acted from momentary impulsiveness and feminine encouragement,
ad not Miss JEssIMINA, with ready-made female wit, answered for
me that it was all right, and that we were the engaged couple.
But her mother expressed an ardent desire to hear my virá voce
corroboration of this statement, tº: me that she was but a
poor weak widow-woman, but that, if it should appear that I. was
merely the giddy trifler of her daughter's young, artless affections,
it would be her doles»me duty to summon instantaneously every
male able-bodied inmate of her establishment, and request them to
inflict deserved º chastisement upon my person 1
So, although still of a twitter with amazement at Miss JESSIMINA's
announcement, I considered it the better part of valour to corrobo-

in such parsimony, since her daughter's eyes supplied such fairy|
rate it with promptitude, rather than incur the shocking punches

JOTTINGS AND TITTLINGS.
(By BABoo HURRY BUNGsHo JABBERJEE, B.A.)
No. XII.
Mr. Jabberjee is taken by surprise.
DILIGENT perusers of my lucubrations to Punch will remember
that I have #. sundry jots and tittles to the subject of Miss
JessiºnAMANKLETow, and already may have concluded that I was
long since up to the hilt in the tender passion. In this deduction,
however, they would have manufactured a stentorian cry from an
extreme paucity of wool; the actual fact being that, although
rcipient of the yº. symmetry of her person and the
adylike liveliness of her deportment, I did never regard her except
with eyes of strictly platonic philandering and calf love.
It is true that, at certain
seasons, the ostentatious
favours she would squander
upon other young masculine
boarders in my presence did
reduce me, to the doleful
dump of despair, so that
even the birds and beasts of
forest shed tears at my
misery, and i. at
meal-times I have sought to
move her to compassion by
neighing like horse, or by
the incessant rolling of my
visual organs; though she
did only attribute such ad
minericordiam appeals to the
excessive yity of ... the
cheese, or the immaturity of
the rhubarb pie.
But I was then a labourer
under the impression that I
was the odd man out of her
affections, and it is .well
known that, to a sensitive,
it is intolerable to feel that
oneself is not the object of
adoration, even to one to
whom we may entertain but
a mediocre attraction.
On a recent evening we
had a tête-d-tête which cul-
minated in the utter surprise.
It was the occasion of our
hebdomadal dancing - º
at Porticobello House, and
had solicited her to become
a co-partner with myself in
the maziness of a waltz;
but, not being the carpet-
knight, and consequentl
treading the measure wit
too great frequency upon the
toes of my fair auxiliary,
she suggested a temporary
withdrawal from circulation.
To which I assenting, she
conducted me to a landin
whereon was a small glaze
apartment, screened by hang-
ings and furnished with a profusion of unproductive pots, which is
styled the conservatory, and here we did sit upon two wicker-worked
chairs, and for a while were mutually sotto voce.
“I became once more the silent tomb.”
illumination, and upon her cheeks was a bloom brighter than many
geraniums. But this compliment she unhappily mistook as an in-
sinuation that her complexion was of meretricious composition, and
seeing that I had put my foot into a cul-de-sac, I became once more
the silent tomb, and exhaled sighs at intervals.
Presently she declared once more that she saw, from the dullness
of my expression, that I was longing for the luxurious magnificence
of my Indian palace.
Now my domestic abode, though a respectable spacious sort of
residence, and containing my father, mother, married brothers, &c.,
together with a few antique unmarried aunts, is not at all of a
palatial architecture; but it is a bad bird that blackens his own
nest, and so I merely answered that I was now so saturated, with
Western civilisation, that I had lost all taste for Oriental splendours.
.Next she inquired whether I did not miss the tiger-shooting and
pig-sticking; and I replied (with veraciousness, since I am not the
au fait in such sports) that I
could not deny a liability to
miss both tigers and pigs,
and, indeed, all animals that
were ferae naturae, and she
condemned the hazardous-
ness of these jungle sports,
and wished, me, to promise
that I would abstain from
them on my return to India.
To this I replied that be-
fore I agreed to such a self-
denying ordinance, I desired
to be more convinced of the
sincerity of her interest in
the preservation of my
humble existence.
Miss JEssIMINA asked
what had she done that I
should be in dubitation as
to her bona fides f
Then I did meekly remind
her of her flirtatious pref-
erences for the young beef-
witted London chaps, and
her incertitude and disdain-
ful capriciousness towards
myself, who was not a beetle-
head or an obtuse, but a
cultivated native gentleman
with high-class university
degree, and an oratorical
flow of language which was
infallibly to land me upon
the pinnacle of some tip-top
judicial preferment in the
Calcutta High Court of
Justice.
She made the excuse that
she was compelled by finan-
cial reasons to be pleasant to
the male boarders, and that
I cruld notexpectany marked
favouritism so long as I kept
my tongue concealed inside
my damask cheek like a
worm in bud.
Upon which, transported
by uncºntrollable emotion, I
ventured to embrace her,
assuring her that she was the cynosure of my neighbouring eyes,
and supplied the vacuum and long-felt want of my soul, and while
occupied in imprinting a chaste salute upon her rosebud lips—who'd

which made it seem totally improbable that she should ever, like my intentions.
Desdemona, seriously incline to treat me as an Othello, commenced
to heave the sighs of a fire-stove, causing Miss JESSIMINA to accuse
me of desiring myself in India.
I denied this with native hyperbolism, saying that I, was content
to remain in statu quo until the doom cº and that the con-
servatory was for me the equivalent of Paradise.
She replied that its similitude to Paradise would be more

or can I tell what I should have
acted from momentary impulsiveness and feminine encouragement,
had not Miss JEssIMINA, with ready-made female wit, answered for
me that it was all right, and that we were the engaged couple.
But her mother expressed an ardent desire to hear my vică, voce
corroboration of this statement, informing me that she was but a
poor weak widow-woman, but that, if it should appear that I was
merely the giddy trifler of her daughter's young, artless affections,

. . . . The cultain fell amidst thunders of
applause, and the approbation was repeated
as each performer walked in turn in front of
the footlights. At length there was a cry for
“Author.” For a quarter of an hour that
gentleman was conspicuous by his absence.
When, however, he did appear, the yells of
derision of a small minority were sufficient to
overwhelm the more favourable demonstra-
tion of the vast majority. But disorderly as
the audience were, they were no worse than
many a first night gathering in a West End
temple of the drama.

. . . . The judge having retired to his
private room after delivering sentence, there
was a demonstration in court, which lasted
for some minutes. The jury cheered to the
echo, and, fancying that they might require
further assistance, his lordship returned to
the bench. Then several persons at the back
of the court commenced “bo-hooing,” and
9nly desisted when the judge had made his
final disappearance. . For that, his lord-
ship had nobly done his duty. -

favour of the new “Bill to Prevent Insults
to Authors in Theatres, &c.” On the other
hand, it is # proper to point out that had
the British Public sufficient self-respect, the
coming statute would be unnecessary. With
a right understanding on the subject, the

would, on such occasion, both find an appro-

such a hurry they don't even give a glance
at a poor wayfarer. Talk of rural quiet!
The rush and tear along country roads is
worse than in town.
I don't ask that everybody walking along
a lane should be offered a friendly seat; only
the obviously respectable, and as obviously
tired, traveller has a claim. Even in this
e of tramps, cycles, high rates, &c., the
old rural civility need not be allowed to die
out. Mr. CHAPLIN has given the farmer a
lift. Let the farmer do the same for the poor
toiler of the roads! Long LANE.

No. 2. “With a song” probably. By GREIFFENHAGEN after

No. 27. “A Legal Fiction.” (John) Doe and (Richard) Roe
nibbling at an apple tree. RoBERT W. MACBETH, A, . -
No. 33. “Clouds o'er the Sea.” Remarkable picture of High
Tide by WATER-Low. See—Waterlow. "
No. 47. “The Widower.” By J. B. BURGEss, R.A., But for
title should have described it as "A Ticklish Situation,” showing
how a poor man in church held his nose to prevent himself from
disturbing the tº; by a violent sneeze.
No. 48, A lov * Dish of Prawns,” taken by a Hook, R.A.
Odd this. Prawns being generally taken by a net. -
The SARGENT, A., who is a General Portrait Painter of the First
Order of Merit, gives us “The Right Hon. Joseph Chamberlain,
M.P.,”,64! But Joseph can't be that! somewhere about 50 would be
nearer the mark. Of course he has an orchid in his buttonhole, and
is probably reading President KRügen's reply, and saying to him:
self, “This is rather an orchid position for me!”. Above his head
Miss, ELIZABETH WHITEHEAD has hung (65), “Chrysanthemums,”
which, if she had only thought of it, ought to have been orchids.
The “Reflections” of W. Q. ORCHARDson, R.A., (71) are charming.
The “Empire” style has long ago, proved, for him at least, the
truth of the saying, “I’Empire, c'est la pair "" or, translated,
“It is the Empire style that pays.” -
No. 83, Mr. SHANNON's Mrs. Baird is ºrming; Another and
§ually, correct title would be, “Missis Clothed,” not “Missis
AIRD,
Mr. G. F. WATTs, R.A., has given us an excellent likeness of
Alfred Gilbert, R.A., Sculptor. Only WATTs's colours ran; so
the dye has come off Mr. GILBERT's tie and has stained his collar,
which has therefore the appearance of having been made out of a
reproduction, in linen, of the willow-pattern-plate tint.
o, 99. Portrait of Mrs. Frank Bibby. By LUKE FILDEs, R.A.
Decidedly “One of the Best.” Motto, words of popular song
adapted:“Jolly! O my and the Bibby!”
No. 105. “Golden October.” By J. MACWHIRTER, R.A. To be
classed not among “the Syrrows” but the “Joys of WHIRTER,”
No. 111. , Stanley. Leighton, M.P., apparently considerably asto-
nished at finding himself so admirably reproduced by our own Sir
John MILLAIS, Bart., P.R.A.
No. 121: Touching picture

Prince Arthur. Wide SHAKSPEARE's King John.
No. 138. Monsieur de Blowitz. By BENAMIN CoNSTANT: Is
this a gift of the painter's to Our Leading Journal, which M. DE
BLowITz has so long and so admirably served? If so, the inscrip-
tion should be “Constant to the Times.” -
With these few notes must end our first visit. We are delighted to
see the veteran. SIDNEY CoopFR, R.A., at his best in 171, “Among the
Mountains in Skye,” but of course not “skye'd.” Also FREDERICK
GooDALL, R.A.. getting away from #; an unsafe place just now,
to give us an English scene in “The Shepherdess and her Flock.”
It is difficult for a Good-all to “go one better,” but he has done it.
We caii attention to President Miſſis” March oness of Tweed-
dale” (280), which, as a speaking likeness, is not “Tweeddale-dumb.”
SEYMOUR LUCAS makes “Spanish Main” tell its own Spanish
tale. See more Ltc.As in our next.
No. 616..." Richard Duke of Gloucester and the Lady Anne.”
Another title. “I)ick and Anne : or, the Double Gloucester who
thinks himself quite the Cheese, and the Lady who has just lost a
Sovereign. Had the artist needed a line of ºpºlº verse, he would
have used “Dick awryl Dick awryl Dockl” For; if ever vi
ought to have ended in a dock, and been found guilty, it was that
accomplished scoundrel, “afterwards RICHARD THE THIRD.” A mar-
vellous work by Edwin A, ARBEY, A., This will be the talk of the
public. The scene is in London, probably in the vicinity of West-
minster, the situation being from Richard the Third, Act.I., scene 1,
and will entitle the American artist to be remembered ever after as
“Westminster Abbey.” This is the picture of the year. Most cer-
tainly it is the very Abbeyest of “Abbey Thoughts.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, April 27.>-House met to-day as
usual at three o'clock; adjournment of business automatio at clang
of midnight: , House being model business assembly, divided its
opportunity into two parts. Up to nine o'clock it ed about how
it would do its business. . At the end, of sixth hour it got to
work upon one of most important bills of . Session; a measure
SquERE of MALwood describes as revolutionising system of local
taxation, and HENRY FowleR denounces as the alternative iniqui-
tously selected by Ministers, in place of taking off a penny from
burden of long-suffering income-tax payer"
However this be, there is involved in measure subvention of a
million and a half a year, drawn from poket of taxpayer paid into
pocket of agricultural ratepayer. To ordinary intelligence seems
more useful to discuss this than to question whether private Members'
time is or is not being taken earlier than usual this Session. House,
of course, is far above range of average intelligence. It knows best.
and it gave six freshest hours of sitting to animated digussion of
order of procedure, leaving dregs of sitting to discussion of Agricul-
tural Rating Bill.
Nor is this all calculated to dumbfounder Average Intelligence,
represented by Man in Strangers' Gallery. Whilst procedure under
discussion benches crowded. In one division 463 voted. Laughter
and cheers from time to time rang through House. When the
second reading Rating Bill came on, tº: array of empty benches
fronted SQUIRE of BLANKNEY, as he frizzled up SHAw-LFFEvge
vainly trying to hide himself in a top-coat under Gallery. TANNER
so touched by this lamentable condition of affairs that, in midst of
one of SQUIRE's towering sentences, he moved a Count. Members
trooped in in numbers sufficient to make a House, but fled from the
wrath yet to come from BLANKNEY. It was all meant for SHAw-
LEFEvre; but spluttering sparks are not discriminating in their
fall, and Members were safer outside.
SHAw-LEFEvee not a Member of the House now, or of course
wouldn't be under the Gallery. Is President of Rºyal Commis-
sion on Agriculture still sitting. Under CHAPLIN's lead it muti:
nied; put the Captain under hatches; then marooned him and
altered the log-book. Castaway rescued by passing whaler; worked
his # home; wrote letter to newspapers attacking CHAPLIN and
his Bill. The SQUIRE now rejoins with terrific force.
Doesn’t seem to have much to do with second reading of Agricul-
tural Rating Bill, but is quite in keeping with the genus of the
sitting. Business done.—Talkee-talkee.
Tuesday.—No more morning, sittings. The Assyrian of Treasury
Bench has come down like a wolf on the fold of the private Member;
eaten up his last ewe lamb, fluffy tail and all. Bitter complaints
more particularly of earliness of raid, , Private Member, acoustomed
to being bullied, argues that at least he might have been left alone
a little longer.
“Never knew such thing done before Whitsuntide,” says
Osborn E MoRGAN.
“Thank your stars it isn't before Easter,” says the SQUIRE of
MALwood, who is in ominously cheerful mood. “Reminds me of a
story O'NFILL DAUNT used to tell, Politically a dreadful man
DAUNT. Worse than DAviTT; but great friend of LEcky's. Must
therefore be respec'able man. tory about widow of Irish
farmer º home from her husband's funeral on crupper of a
neighbour's horse, When they had trotted about quarter of
mile from last resting-place of first husband, the farmer asked the
widow to marry him. "Of course I will,” she said. “Why didn't
you speak sooner?', That’s what I say to PRINCE ARTHUR. He
comes down on 27th of April and takes last vestige of Private
Members' time. “Why didn't you speak sooner,” I ask him.”
This, the first appropriated day, used to push forward second
reading Agricultural Rating Bill. Great interests touched. As
Don Josí, whilst still in state of sin, described situation, Ministers
are robbing PETER to pay PAUL–PETER being the landless millions,
PAUL the many-acred landlord. In such circumstance might expect
benches crowded; House seething with excitement. On contrary,
benches empty, save for Members who had prepared short essays,
and jump up en masse in effort to catch SPEAKER's eye when
another, having finished reading his paper, drops the envied orb.
Only one man, rises above level of depressing circumstances.
Robson, Q.C., stirs sluggish pool with breezy speech. Admirable
in matter, delivered straight out from the shoulder. Best thing yet
done by new Member. SARK, nothing if not precise, says Robson
not new Member, but second-hand. Been in before. That is trifling.
He is new with this Parliament, and if he spares time to its debates
will make his mark in it. But, no man can serve two masters,
especially when one is the insatiable House of Commons.
obson spoke without a note. FINCH-HATION had a sheaf, and
they buried him in their abundance. It was the dawn that did it.
“dawn of better times” heralded by SQUIRE of BLANKNEY's Bill.
This, of course, to be introduced at end of speech., Somehow, or
other notes got mixed. The dawn turned up in the middle of night,
as it were, just at the time where FINCH meant to be telling the
House a few quite proper stories about life in Australia. One mis-
fortune led to another. There was Tyre and Sidon, with the close
bearing of their history on
our system of agricultural
rating; would have made
admirable point ; but one
sheet having got wrong, all
the rest were out of gear;
Tyre and Sidon came in in
the wrong century. Then the
`-- dawn, with, quite uncanny
ºss- abruptness, turned up again,
and FINCH, “welcoming it
with open arms,” as he said,
sat down.
“All very well to laugh at
FINCHEY,” said SARK; “but
he 's quite, right, In, old
times of all-night sittings
often seen a man stretching
himself to welcome dawn
with open arms; and open
mouth too. We used to call
it yawning. But FINCHEY is
too poetic to put it that way.”

2. majority., Had been big tal
of all-night sitting. Members
hurrying home or out to din-
rer froze the social circle with
- gloomy countenance. , “Not
Breezy and Brilliant a pleasant thing, you know,”
reezy and Brilliant, they said, “to be kept out of
R-be-n, Q.C. your bed all night listening to
reiterated argument, or walking round and round the lobby, as if it
were a lap in a ten-mile heel-and-toe match, but it must be done.
Country expects it, and no man should shirk his duty.”
So they moodily sipped an extra glass of port, and went off, ready
to suffer all things, even grilled bones and devilled kidneys between
two and three in the morning. ----
But present House isn't up to all-night sittings. By one o'clock,
when JokIM resumed seat after lively round with SQUIRE OF MALwood,
there were hungry ories for the division. Lough moved adjournment;
PRINCE ARTHUR pounced. Where there is amendment to original
question, Closure involves three divisions. Each division takes
from fifteen to twenty minutes. So, early on this May morning,
round and round the division lobbies we went, as our forefathers
footed it round the maypole. By putting on spurt, got through this
process of legislation just inside fifty minutes; and so home to bed
with proud consciousness of having literally walked the Agricultural
Rating Bill past a second reading. - - - -
SARK has given AKEas-Douglas private notice cf his intention to
ask whether, in view of saying public time, there would be an
objection to laying down cycle tracks in division lobbies. . Has, wit
his usual thoroughness, fº into figures; finds that, without
putting on dangerous speed, at least eight minutes would be saved on
every division; equal in Session of ordinary duration, to nine days.
Business done. — Agricultural Rating Bill read second time,
by 333 votes against 156. -
Friday night—There was a Member of the 1874 Parliament, whº
made a reputation by concluding his speech with the remark, “And
now Mr. SPEAKER, I will sit down by saying.” – To-night, CALDWELL
beat him hollow. As usual in Committee of Supply, he was well to
front, saying nothing in speeches of prºdigious length. STUART-
WoRTLEy, in Chair, kept tight grip upºn him;
“I must remind the hon. Member,” he said, after CALDWELL had
been rambling round for twenty minutes, “of the standing order
against tedious repetition.”
“I was only just finishing up,” CALpweLL pleaded.
“Yes, but you’ve long since finished up your audience,” responded
STUART-WoRTLEy. This, of course, sotto voce. - -
An hour later, he again came in contact with the inexorable Chair.
Called to order, he shewed disposition to argue point. Rebuked
with increased sternness, he said, “Of course, Mr. STUART-WoRTLEY,
I am perfectly willing to sit down upon the point.”
... Such, sinful, lavish, extravagance,” said SARK, really, affected.
“It was the only pointin his remarks, and he sat upon it!”

In quietude of study, FINCH had born to him quite new idea about
Business done.-Wotes in Supply.

delightful. We know that typical

is as hard in drawing as it is to
understand. Why should a female
with classically bound hair and
white classic drapery, surrounded
by signs of the zodiac, all white

the artist intended us to under-
stand that, though he was showing
a drawing light-tinted, he was
yet “keeping it dark.”

insists on the extinction of

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
* ToMºHood As A PoET.
THERE has lately been issued a new edition
of the poems of THoMAs Hoop, and here and
there a reviewer has thought, it worth, his
while to devote a cursory line to the revived
memory of the dead poet. Some of these
notices were sympathetic; some hinted that
HooD's fame, such as it was, rested rather
on his skits, his word-contortions, and his
playful fooling, than on his serious efforts :
and one went so far as to quote a beautiful
verse from the “The Haunted House,” with
the surprising comment that “this sounds
strange at the present day,”, Very few,
however, seemed to think that the compilers
of his poems (my edition, bears date 1857)
were justified in the belief, which they ex-
pressed in their short and touching preface,
“that in any future recital of the names of
writers who have contributed to the stock of
genuine English poetry, THoMAS Hood will
find honourable mention.”
BUT surely the belief is justified. Noman,
it was said of GRAY, ever passed over to the
immortals with a smaller bundle under his
arm. , Hoop's bundle is almost as small as
GRAY's, but, such as it is, it has passed him
through into the green fields and happy
regions just as surely as if he had staggered
in with a huge load upon his shoulders. He
has thought and feeling, he has music, he
has time's great antiseptic, style; there is in
his verse the sense of tears in mortal things,
there is elevation, there is a deep and sincere
§ and there is the refinement which goes
and-in-hand with §: and insight.
Where shall yon find a better equipment for
an immortal
To write indifferent sonnets is as easy as
throwing pebbles into the sea; to write good
sonnets is a tremendous task, and few are
those who have ormed it, and have been
able to fix a shining truth or a genuine
emotion in a perfect setting of fourteen
musical lines. Hood's efforts in this direc-
tion were all good, and two of them are, to
my mind, supreme. Take, for example, this
sonnet on Death:—
It is not death, that sometime in a sigh
This eloquent breath shall take its speechless flight;
That sometime these bright stars, that now reply
In Sunlight to the Sun, shall set in night;
That this warm conscious flesh shall perish quite,
And all life's ruddy springs forget to flow;
That thoughts shall cease, and the immortal spright
Be lapp'd in alien clay and laid below;
It is not death to know this, but to know
That pious thoughts, which visit at new graves
In tender pilgrimage, will cease to go
So º and so oft, and when grass waves
Over the past-away, there may be then
No resurrection in the minds of men.
. ANd here is my second example, a sonnet
in the same sad vein of submission to fate
and circumstance and obliterating forgetful-
Iless :-
SILENCE.
There is a silence where hath been no sound,
There is a silence where no sound may be,
In the cold grave, under the deep, deep sea,
Or in wide desert where no life is found,
Which hath been mute, and still must sleep pro-
found;
No voice is hush’d—no life treads silently,
But clouds and cloudy shadows wander free,
That never spoke over the idle ground:
But in green ruins, in the desolate walls
Of antique palaces, where Man hath been,
Though the dun fox, or wild hyaena, calls,
And owls that flit continually between
Shriek to the echo, and the low winds moan,
Mother of Amateur Photographer. “WHAT AN IDIOTIC Guy You've MADE Youg PAPA Look 1"
Amateur Photographer. “YEs, MAMMA DEAR.
This kind of thing, no doubt, “sounds
strange at the present day,” but its strange-
ness is due to the fact that our ears have
grown unused to the sound of so†. a note,
struck with so certain a hand. Truly it may
be said of Hood in the words of another of
his own sonnets:–
Yet few there be who pipe so sweet and loud,
Their voices reach us through the lapse of space:
The noisy day is deafened by a crowd
Of undistinguished birds, a twittering race;
But only lark and nightingale forlorn
Fill up the silences of night and morn.
BUT read, also, “The Haunted House,”
which our pert critic found so strange. Is
there in all poetry a finer, example of mys:
tery, of eeriness, of midnight feeling in that
troubled half-sleep, in which strange sounds
strike upon the startled ear with a sense of
portent, and the shadows grow and, grow
BUT ISN'T IT LIKE HIM!”
Unhinged the iron gates half open hung,
Jarred by the gusty gales of many winters,
That from its crumbled pedestal had flung
One marble globe in splinters.
+ - + + -
But awfully the truant shunned the ground,
The vagrant kept aloof and daring poacher;
In spite of gaps that through the fences round
Invited the encroacher.
For over all there hung a cloud of fear,
A sense of mystery the spirit daunted,
And said as plain as whisper to the ear,
The place is Haunted.
But space fails me, and I must resume the
consideration of Hood's poems on another
occasion,

PLEASURES FOR PRISONERS.
“In order to carry out certain recommendations of the recent

that lectures on scientific and interesting subjects shall be periodi-
cally given,” . Such is the announcement in the Press... Mr. Punch,

set an examination paper that may be answered by the criminals to

. Give a short account of any two of the
following heroes of romance. Jack Sheppard,
Claude Duval, the Marchioness de Brin-
villiers, Colonel Blood, Richard Turpin, and
“Three-fingered Jack.”
2. Supposing that you wished to enter a
dwelling-house when all the occupants were
fast asleep and all the doors and windows were
securely closed, what scientific method would
you adopt?
3 What is a “jemmy” P. Explain its use.
4. Was Jack Ketch a real person, or only a
type or a myth?
5. Write all you know of Jonathan Wild,
Blueskin, Bill Sykes, and Titus Oates.
6. In what novels (giving the names of
ºf their authors) do the following characters
* figure. Paul Clifford, “the Artful Dodger,”
Barry Lyndon, and Fagin?
7. Give a description of the costumes worn during the last three
hundred years in Her Majesty's gaols.
8. Why are the police called “coppers”?. When did they change
their “toppers” for a helmet? What had the first Sir RoBERT PEEL
to do with the force?
9. What are the advantages and disadvantages of a ticket-of-
leave, a pair of handcuffs, and an alibi f
10. Describe Portland, Portsmouth, Dartmoor, and Holloway.
11. Write out the menu of the regulation dinner of a first-class
misdemeanant, a felon undergoing penal servitude in his third year,
and a person sentenced to seven days' ºil. with hard labour.
12. Supposing (as most º will be the case) that football and
cricket are soon permitted in prisons “to relieve the monotony of
the life of convicts undergoing long sentences” (see Committee on
Prisons' Report), how will, you, when the happy time arrives, pit
establishment against establishment? For instance, should an eleven
from Newgate meet the First Sixteen frºm Springfield Gaol, Chelms-
ford P. If not, why not?
13. How should a prisoner desiring speedy release comport himself

hard,” and “the crank.”
15. What is mealt by “the march of civilisation”? Show how
civilisation has paid less attention to the pauper than the thief.

THE LONDON RATEPAYER'S WADE MECUM.
Question. Can you define rates?
Answer. A good citizen may call them “proper expenditure,” a
man of business “unnecessary evils.” They are considered by many
a means whereby the aristocratic renter of a mansion, is made to
sink below the financial level of an artisan residing in lodgings.
Q. By whom are rates controlled P
A. By the Westry, with the assistance of the School Board and the
County Council.
wº ſº an average London ratepayer belong to any or all of these
108
A. No, he does not, as the expense of entering the two last is
not compensated by the prestige
secured by, admission, and the
idea..of posturing in the first is
considered preposterous.
Q. And yet, does not the com-
fort % the i.º.º #.
payer depend upon the Westry
A. Undoubtedly; but for all
that, he refuses to sit in it.
Q. Why does the average Lon-
don, ratepayer pursue this appa-
rently suicidal course?
A. Because he is under the
impression that, even were he
elected, he would be outvoted in
the Council Chamber and the
Committee room.
Q. Is this impression justified
by facts P
A. To a large extent; as, taking
the average London ratepayer as a professional man, who pays on a
.# of £100 a year and upwards, such a man's vote, if recorded,
would be swamped in the votes of the scores of husbands of small
lodging-house keepers.
Q. What has been the result of this strange apathy P
A. That the rates (f the metropolis have risen during the last few
years by leaps and bounds. -
- But has not this increase been accompanied by proportional
improvement? -
A. A few streets have been widened, and a number of children
have acquired an educational standard unsuitable to their station.
cº #. not the widening of the streets been the feat of the County
unc
A. It has, and the performance has been accompanied by the
mulcting of the ratepayers to an extent entirely unknown to the
London Board of Works,
Q. But is not the London County Council an improvement upon
: º: abused and rightly obselete body to which you have just
reterre
A. It is not so considered by the clearest-headed of Londoners.
Q. Surely the London County Council has high ideals f
A. The loftiest. But, fortunately for Londoners, those ideals are
restrained by the sobering influence of a matter-of-fact Parliament;
Q. With the London County Council in power, is it not probable
that some day the streets of the metropolis may be paved with gold *
A. Such a scheme would, no doubt, obtain the hearty support of
an influential section of that autocratic body.
Q. And how would the plan be carried into effect?
A. Like every other “improvement,” at the expense of the rate-
payers -
Q. Then, under all the circumstances of the case, what advice
would you tender to the London householder?
A. To § up his residence in town, and live in the country.
Q. And why would you tender this counsel ?
A. That he might avoid the rates, and thus escape bankruptcy.
Noble Six Hundred
Or, Wisdom Between Wickets.
TIME's a mere mental figment, sages say,

But half-a-dozen “centuries” in one day,

REVERIES AT LORD’S.
By an Elderly Enthusiast.
MEN welcome the Season for many a reason
For fashion and folly, for love and for larks ;
But not as R. A. time do I greet the Maytime,
With eye to St. Stephen's, the Play, or the Parks.
No, when the May cometh, and Babylon hummeth,
A rosier rapture the Season affords -
To him who with pleasure, in light-hearted leisure,
Enjoys the delights of the first match at Lord's.
The footballing frenzy is over. What men see
In kicking a ball is a marvel to me.
In fields bare and boggy, all muddy and foggy,
To fight for the sphere is a fun I can't see.
But oh I in fine weather the whizz of the leather
Clean banged from the bat is a joy beyond words;
And STODDART's first sixer is just an elixir,
There’s no pick-me-up like the first match at Lord's.
It's well worth a million to see the Pavilion
Warm flushing once more with the faces one knows;
White veteransjolly, who handle a brolly
As though 'twere a bat, and the scoring ran close.
That paunchy old fellow could once wield the willow
Like FELIX or MyNN. Still it draws him like cords,
That first shout of “Over!” and he is in clover
When thus settling down to the first match at Lord's.
Eh P N. 'uns? Lord bless us ! that grim shirt of
essus
We throw off as soon as the wickets are pitched;
The first sight of flannels warms blood in its channels,
The eye brightens up, and the bosom's bewitched.
Take Lancashire's HoRNRY! Is he held in scorn by
Good judges for what Edaa. Rerum records?
His grip as firm-fixed is as when in the Sixties,
Oh, sweet the cool whiff of the turf, the filst sniff of
The fresh London lilac l. There's no need to-day
Of saw-dust or “sweater.” It couldn't be better.
Gad! . Look at the Doctor'. How's that for leg-play.
By Jove! he swiped that well!, Gad! Beaten by ATTEwell!!
Hoped GRACE was well set, for great joy it affords
The “ring,” widely .# to watch him up-pilin
One “century” more in his first match at Lord's
All wished he might do it. Sheer vinegar-cruet
Must he be, who won't wish our Doctor good luck,
“He can't have a season like last,” croakers reason;
But lord! whilst he keeps up his form and his pluck,
Though hard upon fifty, still stalwart and shifty,
Leviathan's play a fair prospect affords
Of splendid surprises at cricketing crises,
Long be it’ere GRAce sees his last match at Lord's l
Young Hears E seems a ripper, and so thinks “The Skipper,”
And STORER to-day makes the bowlers sit up.
DE TRAFFORD’s a stunner as smiter or runner I
An elegant mixture of DEERFoot and KRUPP
We want at a wicket, and then we get Cricket!
I don't like your blendings of blocks and deal boards.
No! keep the game spinning, and—losing or Y.
You're sure to find fun in your first match at Lord's.
Pheugh Now for my dinner! As I am a sinner
I've felt all the day like a frolicsome boy.
Good old 'uns still prizing Iwatch the uprising
Of promising “colts” with a cricketer's joy.
Hooray for King Willow ! When seeking my pillow
I log no “lost day”; and dim dream-world affords
Renewal of pleasure. While health lasts, and leisure,
I'll not miss the joys of the first match at Lord's.

Or thereabouts, he fought his first match at Lord's.

CROSS QUESTIONS:
Or, the Doom of the Yale-ow-backs,
[*The course of lectures on living
English novelists at Yale is to be
discontinued.”—American Paper.]
WE believe, however, that the
following Examination Paper is
likely to be set to all students of
the course:-
1. Explain “the kail-yard
school of fiction.” How many
Scotch ex-Ministers do you con-
sider are uisite in order to
make one § English novelist?
2. Which do you think the
greater master of style—GEORGE
MEREDITH or TWAIN ?
What reason have you for sup-
nsing that the title of Mr.
RDy's last novel was originally
intended to be George the Ob-
scure ?
3. * Sir WALTER SCOTT was
only an inferior STANLEY WEy-
MAN, and ### Rotha has
gone one better, than Ivanhoe.”
Examine this statement,
4. At what date in the twen-
tieth century do you anticipate
that the authoress of Robert
Elsmere will have got through
the stock of immediately available
“burning questions”?
5. Write down in his own lan-
guage, and as far as possible with
due regard to propriety, what Dr.
Johnson would probably have
said with regard to (a) OUIDA, (b)
SARAH GRAND, (c) the Authoress
of The Yellow Aster.
6. Trace the following sentences
to their sources: — (a) “Her
mobile peonymouth.” (b) “The
horizon beyond these calcareous
escarpments was of a deep ultra-
marine.” (c) “Then a strange
thing happened.” (d) “I’m sair

7. Do you agree with the boy's

Samoa of it.” P If not, why not ?
8. It has been said that “the
decease of SHERLOCK Holm Es is

tury.” Is there any exaggeration
about the remark; and to what

an unmuzzled dog at large.”]

ness line,
And W. G. paid a practical fine.
THE proceedings at the Inver-
ness Town Council were recentl
enlivened by a “tiff” j
between two of its orators—one a
baker, the other a publican. The
former having cast aspersions
upon the Licensed Wictualling
profession, the publican, in “re:
plying for the Bar,” suggested
that “the liquor business was con-
ducted as respectably as that of the
baker, and he did not see why any
slur should be thrown upon their
trade.”. Why, indeed? especially
by a maker of loaves! For if bars
were barred, the loafer's occupa-
tion would begone, and there would
be neither cakes nor ale.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, May 4.—“There’s one thing I like
about an Irishman,” said the Member for SARK. “It is the fathom-
less resources of his power of contradiction. These are limited only
by his ignorance of what you are going to say. And that doesn't
. mºtter. If he doesn't have you one way he'll take you in
another.
These reflections arose, on incident connected with Stipendiary
Magistrates (Ireland) Bill: ATToRNEY-GENERAL, FoR IRELAND
moved second reading. Mem on various benches jumped
up with questions. Smack of old times about very title of Bill.
ArToBrey-GENERAL protested there was nothing in it. No change
posed in position, pay, or qualification of magistrates. “It is,”
e add;d, by way of clinching matter, "merely an alteration in the
Ilames
Then JoHN DILLON saw his chance. Glancing round, he perceived
John REDMond wasn't present. Had all the field, to himself.
Ireland should now see which was the true friend, the watchful
warden on the tower.
“I must say, Mr. SPEAKER,” said J. D., regarding with stern
glance PRINCE ARTHUR in º mood on the Treasury Bench,
“I have a preference for the old style of Resident Magistrate.”
“I am glad to hear that,” said PRINCE ARTHUR, blandly; “for
the precise object of the Bill is to restore the title of Resident
Magistrate.”
It is here that pre-eminence of Irish Member in direction indi-
cated by SARK was triumphantly vindicated. Any other community,
abashed by this harmless bl, nder, would have withdrawn opposition
and gratefully, if temporarily, retired into background, Not so the
descendants of many kirgs, Leader of party had specifically
objected to Measure on ground that it destroyed the treasured name
and associations of the Resident Magistrates. No, said PRINCE
“Very well, then,” said DALY (the Daly Inquirer of an earlier
stage of the . “l move that the Bill be read a second time
this day six months.” Then game angry debate, movement of the
adjournment, the closure, division on the closure, division on t
amendment, and final division, by which second reading was carrie
by 171 votes against 47. -
Business done.—Budget Bill retd second time.
Tuesday-John of GoRST, in finest Manipur mood. Business in
hand second reading of a Bill which even PRINCE ARTHUR admits
to be complex and controversial. Others of blunter speech speak of
it as revolutionising system of national education, breaking up pact
of peace that has existed for quarter of century. Opposition Benches
crowded; an angered muster, “breathing war from every nostril,” as
R. G.WHBSTER says. To them entºr John of GoRST with Educa-
tion Bill in hand, casually waving it as if it were red flag and the
crowd before him a herd of wild oxen.
...i. than JoHN's manner, nor softer than his speech.
Not once his voice uplifted above conversational tone; went ambling
along, serenely assuming that everything might be taken for
#. Members opposite, writhed on their seats, yelled contra-
iction, cut themselves with knives (this last in a Parliamentary
sense, of course). , JoHN or Gobst jogged placidly on, just as if he
had been reading his speech to the boulders that form Stonehenge.
Most often he (to quote R. G. WEESTER again) “trod on the toes of
the Nonconformist conscience.” But now and then he, quite acci-
dentally as it seemed, gave his political friends, his pastors and
masters, a sly kncek. Once he kicked out behind at PRINCE
ARTHUR, Don Josſ and other Members of the Cabinet listening
apprehensive. Some º he observed, argued that all would be
well if only the head of the department were called the Education
Minister, with a seat in the Cabinet.
“I cannot for the life of me,” he continued, “see how the Vice-
President of the Council would be more wise or more powerful in
educational matters by having his name changed, and being required

ARTHUR ; exactly the reverse.
to attend the meetings of the Cabinet Council.”

CROSS QUESTIONS:
Or, the Doom of the Yale-ow-backs,
[*The course of lectures on living
English novelists at Yale is to be
discontinued.”—American Paper.]
WE believe, however, that the
following Examination Paper is
likely to be set to all students of
the course:—
1. Explain “the kail-yard
school of fiction.” How many
Scotch ex-Ministers do you con-
sider are uisite in order to
make one English novelist?
2. Which do you think the
greater master of style—GEORGR
MEREDITH or TWAIN ?
What reason have you for sup-
nsing that the title of Mr.
RDY's last novel was originally
intended to be George the Ob-
scure ?
3. * Sir WALTER SCOTT was
only an inferior STANLEY WEy-
MAN, and My Lady Rotha has
gone one better, than Ivanhoe.”
Examine this statement.
4. At what date in the twen-
tieth century do you anticipate
that the authoress of Robert
Elsmere will have got through
the stock of immediately available
“burning questions”?
5. Write down in his own lan-
guage, and as far as possible with
due regard to propriety, what Dr.
Johnson would probably have
said with regard to (a) OUIDA, (b)
SARAH GRAND, (c) the Authoress
of The Yellow Aster.
6. Trace the following sentences
their sources: — (a) “Her
mobile peonymouth.” (b) “The
horizon beyond these calcareous
escarpments was of a deep ultra-
marine.” (c) “Then a strange
thing happened.” (d) “I’m sair

7. Do you agree with the boy's

To make the punishment fit the

that “the liquor business was con-
ducted as respectably as that of the

1. Explain “the kail-yard

sider are uisite in order to
make one English novelist?
2. Which do you think the

What reason have you for sup-
osing that the title of Mr.

intended to be George the Ob-
scure ?
3. * Sir WALTER SCOTT was

4. At what date in the twen-

that the authoress of Robert

due regard to propriety, what Dr.

said with regard to (a) OUIDA, (b)
SARAH GRAND, (c) the Authoress
of The Yellow Aster.
6. Trace the following sentences

House of Commons, Monday, May 4.—"There's one thing I like
about an Irishman,” said the Member for SARK. “It is the fathom-
less resources of his power of contradiction. These are limited only
by his ignorance of what you are going to say. And that doesn't
. matter. If he doesn't have you one way he'll take you in
another.
These reflections arose, on incident connected with Stipendiary
Magistrates (Ireland) Bill. —ATToRNEY-GENERAL FoR IRELAND
moved second reading. Irish Members on various benches jumped
up with questions. Smack of old times about very title of Bill.
ArtoRNEy-GENERAL protested there was nothing in it. No change
posed in position, pay, or qualification of magistrates. “It is.”
§: , by way of clinching matter, “merely an alteration in the
name,
Then JoHN DILLON saw his chance. Glancing round, he perceived
John REDMQND wasn't present. Had all the field, to himself.
Ireland should now see which was the true friend, the watchful
warden on the tower.
“I must say, Mr. SPEAKER,” said J. D., regarding with stern
glance PRINCE ARTHUR in languishing mood on the Treasury Bench,
“I have a preference for the old style of Resident Magistrate.”
“I am glad to hear that,” said PRINCE ARTHUR, blandly; “for
º: pºet of the Bill is to restore the title of Resident
ag1strate.
It is here that pre-eminence of Irish Member in direction indi-
cated by SARK was triumphantly vindicated. Any other community,
abashed by this harmless blinder, would have withdrawn opposition
and gratefully, if temporarily, retired into background, Not so the
descendants of many kirgs, Leader of party had specifically
objected to Measure on ground that it destroyed the treasured name
and associations of the Resident Magistrates. No, said PRINCE
“Wery well, then,” said DALY (the Daly Inquirer of an earlier
stage of the . “l move that the Bill be read a second time

adjournment, the closure, division on the closure, division on th
amendment, and final division, by which second reading was carrie
by 171 votes against 47.
Business done.—Budget Bill retd second time.
Tuesday-John of GoRST, in finest Manipur mood. Business in
hand second reading of a Bill which even PRINCE ARTHUR admits
to be j. and controversial. Others of blunter speech speak of
it as revolutionising system of national education, breaking up pact
of peace that has existed for quarter of century. Opposition Benches
crowded; an angered muster, “breathing war from every nostril,” as
R. G.WHBSTER says. To them enter John of GoRST with Educa-
tion Bill in hand, casually waving it as if it were red flag and the
crowd before him a herd of wild oxen.

Not once his voice uplifted above conversational tone; went ambling
along, serenely assuming that everything might be taken for

iction, cut themselves with knives (this last in a Parliamentary
sense, of course). , JoHN or GoRST jogged placidly on, just as if he
had been reading his speech to the boulders that form Stonehenge.
Most often he (to quote R. G. WEBSTER again) “trod on the toes of
the Nonconformist conscience.”. But now and then he, quite acci-
dentally as it seemed, gave his political friends, his pastors and
masters, a sly kncek. Once he kicked out behind at PRINCE

Minister, with a seat in the Cabinet.

President of the Council would be more wise or more powerful in
educational matters by having his name changed, and being required

Also, there was ALFRED LYITEiron making maiden speech, with
some reminiscences of the oration, prize he took at Cambridge. Got
on very well till he came to talk about “the critics of the Bill.”
For a LYITELTON, this an inevitable pitfall. ALFRED spoke of them

“How's that, SPEAKER P” SARK whispered under his breath.
SPEAKER took no notice, and LYTTELTON carried out his bat,

Just after midnight proceedings enlivened by outbreak. of Civil

INTO SPAIN.
(With a Conversation-Book.)
Cannes.-Read that the weather is dismal and cloudy in England. I
Shall stay in the sunny South a little longer. Cannes is a charming |
place. But might as well see something different. Where to go? |
Consult map. Good idea. Spain. Consult time-tables, Easiest
thing in the world. Tarasconto Barcelona.
What is there to see in Barcelona P. Nuts
probably. , Also Spanish manners and cus-
toms, dark eyes, fans, mantillas, and so
forth. Shall certainly go, after a few days.
Gocd idea to learn a few words of Spanish,
Must be very easy. Italian and French
mixed, with some Latin added. Amiable
Frenchman in hotel supports this view.
He says, airily, “Vous quittez Paris dans
le ‘sleeping,’ vous achetez, des journaur
espagnols dº Irun, et, arrivé à Madrid,
vous parlez espagnol.” Cannot hope to
rival that linguistic feat, but may be able
to learn a few phrases between Cannes
and Barcelona. Buy a conversation-book
in French and Spanish. - -
Port Bou.—Across the frontier. Custom-house, station. Now is
the time to begin Spanish. , Have read some of that conversation-
book on the way. Begin to doubt its utility. Usual sort of thing.
“Has thy brother bought a boot-jack?” “I wish these six volumes
of Molliar's plays to be bound in half calf.” And so forth. This
one is the same, only in French. -
Custom-house officer, in beautiful uniform and bright green gloves,
very strict in his examination of my luggage. The green gloves
travel all over my property, and bring out, a small cardboard box,
Triumphant expression on official's face. He has caught me. Qpen
box, and show him it contains a few white ties. His face now shºws
only doubt and amazement, Cannot explain to him verbally,
Evidently useless to mention the binding of MontèRE's plays. The
en, gloves beckon another custom-house officer, wearing
§: green gloves. Together they examine my harmless white
ties. It seems to me the green gloyed hands are held up in pious
horror. Try them in French, in Italian, in English. No good.
Should perhaps tip them in Spanish. But why waste pesetas? So
refrain. They º their heads still more suspiciously. The only
thing remaining for me to do is to ask if the brother of one of them
has bought a boot-jack. Does not seem very º: but, if said
politely, might imply that I wish to change the subject., Am just
about to begin the note of interrogation upside down, which gives
such an uncanny air to a Spanish question, when they cease looking
at my ties, and I pass on.
Barcelona.-Shall have no difficulty here. Have been told that
French is spoken everywhere. If not, then English or Italian.
Everyone in the hotel speaks French. To the bank. Manager
speaks English beautifully. Buy some cigarettes. Old woman, in
the shop speaks Italian. Shall get on capitally. Need not trouble
to carry the conversation-book in º K. -
In the evening to the opera. alk out between the acts, seeing
Spaniards also walking out, and enter a café, Qrder coffee. ...Waiter
brings a huge glass of water, and a cup, filled to the brim with
sugar, on which the verseur is about to pour my drink. Stop him.
Explain in French that I take no sugar. The two, and another
waiter, stand round me, with dazed faces. By Jºve, they speak only
Spanish! Wish I had the conversation-book. But should probably
have found something like “Nous ne voulons pas faire une excursion
en mer, parce qu'il %; trop de cent,” or “Qes bottines son: un petſ
4troites, veuillez les élargir.” - No good trying talking. Turn out
eight or ten lumps of sugar, and so get my coffee. Then return to the
opera. Four polite officials at the entrangef. wonderingly at the
counterfoil of my ticket, which I conclude served for readmission,
no pass ticket being offered. Ask each one, in turn, if he speak:
French. He does not. Oh for the conversation-book! If only I
could say “Tous les tableauz dans le Salon Carré du Louvre sont
des chefs-d'oeuvre,” or “Est-ce que mademoiselle votre fºur joke
du piano?” I should have shown myself to be an individual with
innocent and refined tastes, and not a. socialist or a brigand. The
second phrase would have been singularly appropriate in the opera
house, Alas, I cannot So address them in French, with bows and
smiles...And they respond in Spanish, evidently with great oourtesy,
also with bows and smiles, and let me passin, probably because they
cannot make me understand that I ought to stop out. For the
future I must carry that conversation-book everywhere.

motto, “All flesh is grass.” . Ask what is going on? Answer,
Nothing in particular. Try to find notices, advertisements, or bills.
Can’t. Good idea this for hotel. Happy Thought.—Don’t give any
ºtion of what’s going on outside. Then visitors will remain
inside.
Next Morning.—Still lovely, or lovelier. Down early. Breakfast.
Lounge. Admire, at distance, steamer departing from pier, to
go, as far as I remember ºwhich is not going so very far, after all-
to Swanage and back. Lots of steamers do this in course of day.
I affirm this, with reservation, to my friends, who rely on my infor-
mation, as “knowing the place.”
I tell them we shall find all information posted up on or about
pier. Entrance to pier 2d. It used to be a penny. Unwise pro-
ceeding this. If it's only a penny you pay without thinking. But
if it's twopence you think twice. Then, to equalise it, you go earlier
and stay dºuble as long as you used to do for a penny. “Pennywise
twopence foolish” policy this. When does band play? No notice
visible. What does band play when it does play? Nobody knows.
This is one of the Secrets of B'mouth ! There may be a boy with
programmes. Don't see him. Another secret. Subsequently hear
band, but see no boy and get no programme.
How about the steamboat trips to Swanage? Delightful idea;
over to Swanage and back for a blow. Inquire of ancient mariner
with gold band round his nautical cap. Boat to Swanage? Oh,
gone an hour or more ago... Then that was the steamer I was ad-
miring in the distance. When’s the next? He is reticent person-
ally, but refers me to the board. Evidently another Secret of
B'mouth. I cannot find any mention of any boat going to Swanage
until next Monday morning, by which time I shall have left. “Too
late! too late!” I return to my nautical authority in gold-banded
cap. “Yes,” says he briefl y; but politely, “steamer to Swanage at
three, and back here by 5:15.”
“Excellent, well, i' faith,” I return, and my party repeat this
expression of delight in chorus. “But, pardonme, §. ancient gold-
banded mariner; is the fact of the boat leaving at three a secret
known to you only, and, it may be, to one or two others?”
“Nay,” replies mine ancient, “’tis advertised, and ye will find it
upon the notice board.”
Politely we refer him back to his own authority. He walks to the
board, and, after close and thorough inspection. he is taken aback.
-- Marry oome up! ” quoth the old sea-dog, his timbers shivering
under the shock; “but, it ain't been put in ''” And, sure enough
the announcement of the departure *i. second boat that day had
been omitted, and but for the mere accident of our curiosity, its
departure would have remained unknown to all, and would have been
hereafter reckoned as among the Secrets of B'mouth.
Swanage deferred. If the mountain would not come to MAHOMET
we know what happened. But here the case is reversed; as thus,
the raison d’étre of Swanage is luncheon and lobster; and if you
can get the lunch and the lobster without going to Swanage, so much
the better for the consumer on the spot, and so much the worse for
Swanage. The Royal Tepid Bath Hotel produces Swanage lobsters
and lunch. Ergo, stay and enjoy the same without exertion.

for the knowledge of the ways of the place possessed by one of our
party, I should have missed this pleasantly soothing concert.
Then a stroll to the golf links. Here B'mouth sets an excellent
example to all golf-linking seaside resorts. The public is admitted
free. They can walk about, protected by nets from the whacks and

As we sit in our Pullman car,

Good dinner at R. T. B. hostelrie. Excellent English asparagus
for home consumption. Might dine as vegetarians on this food, with
motto, “All flesh is grass.” . Ask what is going on? Answer,
Nothing in particular. Try to find notices, advertisements, or bills.
Can’t. Good idea this for hotel. Happy Thought.--Don't give any
ºtion of what’s going on outside. Then visitors remain
inside.
Nert Morning.—Still lovely, or lovelier. Down early. Breakfast.
Lounge. Admire, at distance, steamer departing from pier, to
go, as far as I remember—which is not going so very far, after all-
to Swanage and back. Lots of steamers do this in course of day.
I affirm this, with reservation, to my friends, who rely on my infor-
mation, as “knowing the º
I tell them we shall find all information posted up on or about
pier. Entrance to pier 2d. It used to be a penny. Unwise pro-
ceeding this. If it's only a penny you pay without thinking. But
if it’s twopence you think twice. Then, to equalise it, you go earlier
and stay dºuble as long as you used to do for a penny. “Pennywise
twopence foolish?” policy this. When does band play ? No notice
visible. What does band play when it does play? Nobody knows.
This is one of the Secrets of B'mouth ! There may be a boy with
programmes. Don't see him. Another secret. Subsequently hear
band, but see no boy and get no programme. *
How about the steamboat trips to Swanage? Delightful idea;
over to Swanage and back for a blow. Inquire of ancient mariner
with gold band round his nautical cap. Boat to Swanage? Oh,
gone an hour or more ago. Then that was the steamer I was ad-
miring in the distance. When’s the next? He is reticent person-
ally, but refers me to the board. Evidently another Secret of
B'mouth. I cannot find any mention of any boat going to Swanage
until next Monday morning, by which time I shall have left. “Too
late! too late!” I return to my nautical authority in gold-banded
cap. “Yes,” says he briefly, but politely, “steamer to Swanage at
three, and back here by 5.15.”
“Excellent, well, i' faith,” I return, and my party repeat this
expression of delight in chorus. “But, pardonme, thou ancient gold-
banded mariner; is the fact of the boat leaving at three a secret
known to you only, and, it may be, to one or two others?”
“Nay,” replies mine ancient, “’tis advertised, and ye will find it
up on the notice board.”
Politely we refer him back to his own authority. He walks to the
board, and, after close and thorough inspection. he is taken aback.
“Marry come up! ” quoth the old sea-dog, his timbers shivering
under the shock; “but, it ain't been put in ''” And, sure enough
the announcement of the departure of the second boat that day had
been omitted, and but for the mere accident of our curiosity, its
departure would have remained unknown to all, and would have been
hereafter reckoned as among the Secrets of B'mouth.
Swanage deferred. If the mountain would not come to MAHOMET
we know what happened. But here the case is reversed; as thus,
the raison d'étre of Swanage is luncheon and lobster; and if you
can get the lunch and the lobster without going to Swanage, so much
the better for the consumer on the spot, and so much the worse for
Swanage. The Royal Tepid Bath Hotel produces Swanage lobsters
and lunch. Ergo, stay and enjoy the same without exertion.

in tune. But even this is a Secret Entertainment, as, had it not been
for the knowledge of the ways of the place possessed by one of our
party, I should have missed this pleasantly soothing concert.
Then a stroll to the golf links. Here B'mouth sets an excellent
example to all golf-linking seaside resorts. The public is admitted
free. They can walk about, protected by nets from the whacks and
thwacks of the stalwart ball-driving golfers: and if any one would
phy the game, he pays and plays.
'mouth knows how to enjoy itself, and to make its visitors enjoy
themselves. It lays out winter gardens, it gives first-rate concerts
daily and nightly; it devises golf-links, croquet-grounds, bowling-
f. cricket-fields, and it sets up restaurants; and also provides
or a rainy day with plenty of shelters.
Only one fault have I to find with B'mouth, and that is its unpre-
cedented modesty. , For possessing, as, it does, all these attractions
it makes no public boast of them; and it is only with difficulty and
considerable enterprise that a stranger visiting this place for the first
time can discover all these things. Publicity is required. But once
you know B'mouth, there are few, very few places where, at all
times and seasons, and on all days, Sundays excepted, you can findso
much and so varied amusement; and where, taking for granted the
climate agrees with you, so many happy days of living out of doors

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
Tom Hood As A Port. (Contd.)
. I HAVE said that Hood's right to such
immortality as poetry, can confer comes from
a comparatively small volume of literary
“baggage.” I do not mean, that his output
was small. No man, indeed, worked more
assiduously at the literary business, for
on the eds of what he did he had to
rovide bread for himself and his dear ones,
ut some of his chief and most immediate
successes with the public were gained by him
as a humorist, * at the verbal contortions
which CHARLEs LAMB defended, and there-
after the public would have him chained to
an oar in the punning galley; . His wonderful
feats therein are remembered for and against
him even now, and it cannot be doubted that
their fame has obscured the higher glory
which is justly his as a true poet, a master of
edy, humour, pathos, and music. Still,
whenafi necessary deductions have been made,
and when, in contemplating what remains, an
appreciator can say to himself, “here there
is no piece that is not worthy of the front
rank,”, the amount, left, though not, sur-
prisingly large, is of a quite extraordinary
range and variety.
QF Hoop as a sonnetteer I have spoken,
not, as I believe, with a higher enthusiasm
than is due to his merits. But he fingered
too, and with no º or wavering hand,
the larger harp, which had been swept by
KEATs and SHELLEY. I do not say that
Hood reached to the heights of passion
where SHELLEY controlled his whirlwinds and
his lightnings, but some of SHELLEY’s magical
music had been breathed into Hoop's song.
And of KEATs's there was a still greater
ortion. Yet Hood was, of eourse, no imitator.
very age has its own appropriate language
of poetical expression, and as the Elizabethans,
on the one d, seemed to find, a natural
voice for their great thoughts in the mighty
line that MARLowe and SHAKSPEARE wrought
to º and, on the other hand, sported
at leisure in the fascinating lyrics th. º
be found in Mr. A. H. BULLEN's delightful
book, so to SHELLEY KEATs, and Hoop there
ained in common a style in which their
oughts, even in their moments of highest
exaltation, flowed with untroubled ease. The
similitude must not be strained too far, but
withduequalificationsitunquestionably exists.
IN the “Plea of the Midsummer Fairies,”
“Lycus, the Centaur,” “Hero and Leander,’
and “The Two, Peacocks of Bedfont,” one
: find not only the haun melody and
melancholy by which Hood's best work is
marked, but also a perfection of expression,
remarkable verbal felicity, and a singular
power of painting a picture. It is difficult to
select, but I venture to quote one verse from
the first of these poems:-
Then next a fair Eve-Fay made meek address,
Saying, “We be the handmaids of the Spring,
In sign whereof, May, the quaint broideress,
Hath wrought her samplers on our gauzy wing.
We tend upon buds' birth and blossoming,
And count the leafy tributes that they owe–
As, so much to the earth-so much to fling
In showers to the brook—so much to go
In whirlwinds to the clouds that made them grow.”
And throughout the pitiful plea of the fairies
one finds the same dainty delicacy as of the
timid rustle of many fluttering little wings
on a cool and moonlit night.
AND, in a different strain, can anything be
more touching and beautiful than “I Re-
member, I Remember,” with its last verse
that speaks straight to every heart:-
I remember, I remember
The fir-trees dark and high;
I used to think their slender tops
Were close against the sky:
It was a childish ignorance,
But now 'tis little joy
To know I'm farther off from heav'n
Than when I was a boy.
It is on this side that Hood, comes into rela-
tion with THACKERAY, and the tie grows
stronger, as one reads “A Retrospective
Review” and “To —, composed at Rotter-
dam.” For instance:—
Then here it goes, a bumper-
The toast it shall be mine,
In Schiedam or in sherry,
Tokay, or hock of Rhine;
f well deserves the brightest
Where sunbeam ever swam—
“The girl I love in England”
I drink at Rotterdam.
In these verses, as in every piece of verse
he wrote, Hoop displays his remarkable mas-
tery over words, his power of j ſº with
them, of adapting them, willy; , to his
purpose; of ing them, as it were, dance
to his music, and that too in a measure that
seems the perfection of rhythmical ease. As
in athletic exercises—in gymnastics let us
say, or in oarsmanship—those who have the
highest training and the best skill perform
the hardest feats and do the soundest work
with a grace and apparent lack of exertion
that deceive the spectator; so in the exercise
of words, the great masters, seem, without
striving, to obtain just the right and necessary
effect. And Hood, whether we consider him
as a punster or a poet, was unquestionably a
great master of words.

remarkable verbal felicity, and a singular
power of painting a picture. It is difficult to

The fir-trees dark and high;
I used to think their slender tops
Were close against the sky:
It was a childish ignorance,
But now 'tis littlejoy
To know I’m farther off from heav'n
Than when I was a boy.
It is on this side that Hood comes into rela-
tion with THACKERAY, and the tie grows
stronger, as one reads “A Retrospective
Review” and “To —, composed at Rotter-
dam.” For instance:—
Then here it goes, a bumper-

purpose; of making them, as it were, dance
to his music, and that too in a measure that
seems the perfection of rhythmical ease. As
in athletic exercises—in gymnastics let us
say, or in oarsmanship-those who have the
highest training and the best skill perform
the hardest feats and do the soundest work
with a grace and apparent lack of exertion
that deceive the spectator; so in the exercise
of words, the great masters, seem, without
striving, to obtain just the right and necessary
effect. And Hood, whether we consider him
as a punster or a poet, was unquestionably a
great master of words.

MR. H. W. Lucy has done many good things, but never
anything better, in its way, than A Diary of the Home-
Rule Parliament, 1892–1895 (CASSELL & Co.). It is no
small feat to write of the proceedings in Parliament, as Mr.
Lucy does day by day and week by week, in such a way as
to make the reading delightful to ordinary readers; but to
make the past records of the two Houses amusing and in-
teresting, to breathe life into the dry bones of 1892–1895
is, I fancy, a record performance even for Mr. LUCY. He
has done it in this book, and done it in a style so crisp
and bright, with a humour so abundant, and with an observa-
tion so keen, that, as one reads it, one imagines that, for
entertainment and º: the Houses of Commons
and of Lords must be the finest “Halls” in all London.
And there is no lack throughout the 480 es of which
the book is composed of those rarer gifts of sympathy and
tolerance which have given to Toby, M.P. (if one may say
so in the es which he adorns), the very highest place
among Parliamentary chroniclers.

melancholy about the title. In four cases out of ten the

To those who have dined “not wisely but too well” last

But would attack him ruthlessly
And bring him down a cropper.

A heartless superintendent would
Dismiss him from the force.

of the Opera is only up to that of the Ouverture, DRURIoI.ANUs OPERA-

absence. House enthusiastic for

Romeo physically and operatically;
and likewise evincing great delight
at once seeing Miss EMMA

second acts is, recipient of floral
tributes presented vid Signor MAN-
CINELLI, who is permitted to take
a sniff at 'em, and then has to
“stand and deliver” the floral
tributes smilingly. Signor RINAL-
DINI comes out strong as Benvoglio,
a name originally intended by
SHAKESPEARE as a quiz on his
somewhat quarrelsome friend BEN
Jonson. This fact not generally
known, but interesting. At some
time of the evening the National
Anthem was sung, but this depo-
ment has not as yet met anybody

delightful, but too .# MISS MARIE ELBA excellent as boy
Hänsel, and Miss JEssPE HUDDLEston equally good as Gretel; but
for three acts to dependentirely on two Babes in the Wood, with a
German nutcracker of a woodman, capitally played and sung by Mr.
DAVID BISPHAM, with just a sprinkling of the very archest angels,
pantomime witch, and fairies, thrown in, rather too much. So

subscribers wishing for any characters in an opera to be sung in some
particular dialect, will kindly give notice ten days beforehand, and
their wishes will be attended to. Evidently to be a member, male
or female, of the chorus at the Royal Polyglottic Opera, is “a liberal
education in itself.”
Friday Night.—Faust. JEAN DE RESZKE, Faust; tºother DE

satisfactory substitute. Then at last moment Brother JEAN, it
was reported, hurt his ankle, either in getting out of a bath
or off a bicycle, and couldn't sing. So M. Bonn ARD came to
the rescue of Rºszke, and appeared as Faust. But why should

Surely he might have come on in a bath-chair, and have made love
to Marguerite Eames just as well seated as walking about. And
think how touching the scene in the garden would have been,
ending with invalided Faust wheeled by Mephisto up to the window,
and stretching out from his bath-chair to embrace Maggie. However,
this wasn't done, and BonnaRD amply satisfied the abonnés, including
critical Royalties. Opera went Faust-rate, -
Miss EAMEs wore a novelty in sants' caps; her appearance in

... I would rather see her as somebody else-a in another, opera.
This is to me a bit heavy. Nothing light or amusing, eh? There's
no laugh in Lohengrin, though there’s always a “grin’ in it.” At

severely straight at WAGSTAFF, the latter disappears, and, for this
night only, is heard no more... End of first Polyglottic Opera week.

ANTIQUARIAN AND MoDERN.—The name of the Coroner at Bethnal
Green is Dr. WYNN WESTcott. Evidently old family.
“A painted vest Prince WoRTIGERN had on
Which from a naked Pict his grandsire won.”
Dr. WYNN WESTCOTT clearly descended from Prince WortigERN,
who took the name of “Win-West-got.” Subsequently "Wynn
Westcott.” After searching among traditions of his ancient line—
which should be a clothes-line—Dr. WYNN WESTCOTT is reported to
have said, the other day, that, the union of two blind people who
met, loved married, and ived happily ever afterwards, was “the
most remarkable marriage he had ever heard of.” But why? Love
is blind; and in a true love-match both parties are quite blind. And
somay they always continue to be, blind, that is, to each other's faults.

THE BOLD BUCCANEER,
(An Up to-date Drawing room Ballad for Young
Britons of “Elizabethan " Enthusiasm.)
OH, if I'd my choice of a living,
I’d fain be a Bold Buccaneer,
Hot beans to the Boers gaily giving,
And besting the bumptious Mynheer.
A latter-day DRAKE, or a RALEIGH,
In just what would suit me—you bet!
Jog’s scruples do make me feel crawly,
Me—and the St. James's Gazette.
I do hate these days of decorum.
Law, order, and all such small beer,
Rum and gunpowder mix for º jorum l
I'd'fain be a Bold Buccaneer!
Queen BEss knew a man when she saw him;
Now if a truejhero runs loose, -
There’s lemon-tongued LABBy to “jaw”him,
And Oom PAUL to twist him a noose.
Oh! would I were Elizabethan,
And singeing the King o' SPAIN's beard'
Brfs nothing loved better to see than
One who Don or Devil ne'er feared.
She 'd have given the Dutchman a
drubbing,
And made our new CECIL a Peer.
Now a raid sets us funking and blubbing,
I’d fain be a Bold Buccaneer!
Gallant DRAKE, we're now told, was a pirate,
And RALEIGH a mere fili !
But now if a RHODEs goes a-raiding,
He's promptly thrown over—by Joe,
Midst crass Nonconformist upbraiding,
And Radical hullaballoo.
If a patriot mustn't turn raider,
For fear of some blooming Mynheer,
Let who will be Soldier or Trader,
I'd fain be a Bold Buccaneer!
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY or Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, May 11.-
“Yes, Toby, I am very much touched with
my reception to-night,” said Professor JEBB
j the nap of his hat with the cuff of
his coat. “I am one of those persons who
suffer on entrance to House of Commons by
having established reputation outside. Of
course on my own dunghill at Cambridge, if
I please to crow, I expect to receive respectful
attention. It’s different here. Think I’ve
heard you don't like Professors? Neverthe-
less, had close and respectful hearing
throughout my speech on Education Bill. It
was the demonstration at the end that almost
took my breath away with pleasure. Been

Otherwise he was afraid the Borough Mem-
hers would think I had dropped into Welsh.
That hardly seemed worth while. So gave up
the Greek; cut down perorations to bare two:
delivered one, I trust not without grace, cer-
tainly not without effect. House not spe-
cially crowded at moment. Fancy they didn't
know I was going to s ; benches opposite
pretty full. When I came to last word of
peroration Number One, Members opposite,
unable any longer to control their feelings,
with one accord leaped to their feet.
“There were forty of them at least. Have
read of this kind of thing before, you know.
During hot crises of Home-Rule Debate, the
conclusion of Mr. G.'s great speeches, his
entering and leaving the House at particular
epochs, were made occasion for similar demon-
strations. Members being on their feet waved
their hats and cheered. Quite expected excited
crowd opposite me to do the same. Fancy,
they were afraid of SPEAKER interfering.
Anyhow, each, man of them stood with head
craned forward, eye fixed with agonized glance
on SPEAKER. Scene almost E. in its in-
tensity; didn't desire to prolong it. So, bow-
ing my acknowledgments, and with difficulty
controlling my emotion, I went on again.

evidence of the honourable emotion that underlies ordinarily repel-
lant appearance of House. It is profoundly moved by sound argu-
ment conveyed in Jucid speech; occasionally, rising to flights of
eloquence. "Wish I knew Member who audibly sat on his hat;
would like secretly to convey to him a new one.”
Pity SARK wasn't by to hear this. He would cheerfully have told
the Professor he was labouring under a misapprehension; that the
crowd of Members leaping to their feet thought he had finished his
speech, and were merely trying to catch the SPEAKER's eye. I, more
tender-hearted, said nothing.
Business done.—Speech making round Education Bill.
Tuesday.-Spite of all hints to the contrary, there is a good deal of
humour about the House of Commons. Nothing could finer in
its way than assumption on Opposition side of indignant grief at
PRINCE ARTHUR's determination to close to-night debate on Educa-
tion Bill, Been dragging on forlornly through five nights—or is it
five weeks? On successive days has been first order. House usually
full at question time. Questions over, SPEAKER observes, “The
Clerk will now proceed to read the Orders of the Day.”
Instantly movement amongst serried ranks. Clerk's response
quickens it. “The Eiucation, Bill; second reading.” These
simple words act upon gathering like a cry of “Fire!” Everybody
makes for the ...Tº save JoHN of GoRST, who, as
Minister in charge of Bill, must at least put on appearance of
attending to debate; a Member of Front Opposition Bench deputed
to represent a late and now absent Ministry; and some thirty or
forty Members dispersed over benches. Every man of these last is
clutching the paper he hopes to be able to read, hungrily watching
the Member on his feet, anxious chiefly to know, not what he thinks
of the four-shilling grant, the new local authority, or the Cowper-
Temple clause, but at what precise minute he will sit down, and
make opening for another.
Of course there have been variations, when some important or
attractive speaker has taken up the running. But this the general
aspect. Then comes PRINCE ARTHUR with the blesséd shears, and
threatens to cut the thin spun thread. Instantly Opposition get their
back up. If there is one thing Members to left of SPEAKER desire more
earnestly than opportunity for taking part in debate, it is the luxury
of hearing others speak. Their emotion so overpowering, cannot
trust themselves to remain in their E. through this the last
prized opportunity. Through the long hours benches empty; aspect
of place as dreary as heretofore. As for SQUIRE of MALwood, much
as he has suffered º a blameless life, this the unkindest cut
of all. If there was for him one pathway on which Duty and Plea-
sure met, and walked hand in hand in placid delight, it was listening
to debate on Education Bill. Hardly could he be torn * from
Front Bench to eat a dry crust. As for a cigar, wouldn't look at
one longer than his forefinger. Looking forward through it all to
pleasure of himself contributing to the swelling tide of heart-stirring
...: that had seethed around this stage of the Bill. Proposal
to closure debate on the fifth night too much for him.
"If they're going to closure,” said he, “let them gag me too.”
So the noblest Roman of them all sat in statuesque silence, an
attitude infinitely more eloquent than the most M. speech.
Business done.-Second reading Education Bill carried by 423 votes
against 156.
Thursday.—The crowning distress of agriculture is, that it is
}. represented in House of Commons by the plumpest of our
ellow-kind, sleek-headed men, and such as sleep o' nights. It has
ever been thus. Years ago, the sorrows of the farmer used to be
chanted by JAMEs HowARD, Member for Bedfordshire in the 1880-5
Parliament. He was himself something in the agricultural imple-
ment line, and had many means of knowing how farming business
pººr. or otherwise. Then, as now, it was generally otherwise.
ut when HowARD was on his feet, his rosyface illumined with
content, his paunchy person plainly full of beaf or mutton, the whole
thing came to have farcical air estinating his advocacy to defeat.
Same in its way to-day with the more-than-ever ruined farmer.
SQUIRE of BLANKNEy, in charge of Rating Bill, can hardly be
regarded as an object-lesson in agricultural distress. When resist-
ing amendments, he does his best to put on haggard look. But
success not thorough.
Then there’s Major RAsch, with whose constituents in Essex things
are so bad that he always walks to London at opening of Session.
To-night he came up again with his dolorous tale. Once in happy
Essex it was twenty tenants running after a farm; now it is twenty
#. running after a tenant. As for the landlords their position is
opeless.
"Isn't there someone in SHAKSPEARE, Toby, dear boy,” he said,
as he dallied over the basin of soupe maigre that serves for his
evening meal, “who remarks, “See what a rent the envious Casca
made'? I don't remember at the moment what line of business
Casca took, whether he owned land or houses. But I’ll undertake
to say that if he'll come down to Essex and put his money in land,
he'll make no rent at all.”
forth by a man of Rasch's appearance—plump, well set up, well
dressed, to-night gay with bouquetted, button-hole—there is certain
incongruity about situation that fatally militates against effect.of
appeal. Business done.-In committee on Agricultural Rating Bill.
RUSS WERY MUCH IN URBE.
(By our Trusted Correspondent at the Coronation.)
YoU were quite right to let me go to Moscow in good time. As
you had foreseen, apartments were at a premium. I have had the
greatest difficulty in getting what is called over here a shakdownski,
It is a sort of temporary shelter. I sleep on a couchoff—a kind of
º sofa-situated in what they quaintly term, a
|ſ º thirdfloorbackski. My room is very near the
* L clouds, or, to use Russian, the skisky. The
place is filling fast, but at present most of the
important personages are absent. The Duke
and Duchess of Connaught will be here be-
fore this packet reaches you. As you know,
H.R.H. commands, at Aldershot, and the
Duchess is the daughter of that gallant warrior
who was known in the Franco-German War as
... the Red Prince.” All the military men of
the various nationalities are wearing their
uniforms. Those who come from England
ſº appear usually in scarlet.
And now, no doubt...you would like some
account of Moscow. Well, a good deal of it
? has been re-built since it was burned to the
hasement in the time of NAPOLEoN THE GREAT.
When the fire to which I refer took place,
the snow was lying thick on the ground-
at the moment of writing the trees are in leaf, and the flowers in
bloom. Of course, I was not present at the conflagrationoff
(Russian for “the fire”), but one of the oldest inhabitants tells
me-sofar as I can understand his lingo—that “the contrast between
then and now was very marked.” I have no great faith in Mus-
covite veracity, but this statement savours of truth: .. -
Moscow is full of streets. Each street has several liº placed in
a sort of receptacle for gas jets, called lampostoffs. The city, as a
whole, is something like Fulham plus a dash of Venice, with a
soupçon of Paris thrown in. It is rather difficult to give a better
description. - The principal church is called the Kremlin. It has a
gilded roof, and in this respect resembles to some extent the cross at
the summit of the dome of St. Paul's. - -
Of course it is impossible to describe the Coronation until it has
taken place-quite impossible... However, it is an open secret that
the Czar is to wear a crown on the occasion. He is to put this head-
gear on the top of his head, and then to take it off to put on the head
3f the Czºrºa. Then there is to be much shouting, and some
soldiers (belonging I am told to the Artillery), are to let off some
cannons. This is the programme as at present arranged, but like
all other programmes is, of course, subject to alteration.
For the moment, I do not think I can tell you any more. In my
next I may be able to give you, some account of the public monu-
ments. To the best of my recollection they consist of the Russian
Museum, the South Moscow Museum, the National Portrait Gallery,
the Muscovite School of Mines (in Jermynoff Streetski), and the
Earlscourtsikoff. Exhibition... I cannot verify these statements as
unfortunately, I have mislaid my guide-book.. But of one thing f
am certain, you were most wise in sending me to Russia, as I could
not possibly have given you the above interesting account had I
remained in Fleet Streetski. I should say Fleet Street. And with this
remark I drop into Anglo-French and write “a do.”
AMong THINGs Not JENNERALLY KNowN.--The cost of an annual
celebration of the First Innoculation at Bückeburg is defrayed, so
the Standard correspondent informs us, “out of a fund established
by a contemporary of Dr. JENNER, a Dr. FAUST.” A Doctor Faust,
forsooth ! There can be but one Dr. Faust. and if so, wasn't
innoculation the invention of Mephistopheles? This may add another
feather to the cap of Mephisto, but it will serve as a powerful
argument on the side of the angels, that is, the anti-vaccinators,
and therefore the anti-Faust-and-Mephistopheles combination.
“THE BLUE, THE FRESH, &c.”—There is a “Real Blue Hunga-
rian Band.” Why not “The True Blue" P. And an “Original Blue
Hungarian” ditto. Anybody suffering from "doleful dumps,” the
result of dyspepsia, can try the homeopathic principle of curing like
with like, and attempt to dispel his melancholia by getting the
Blues, above-mentioned, to play a few tunes to him.

will look in “during Monday

acquaintance, and the chances
are ten to one that he (or,
better still, she) will “stay

you must choose the more

fraud will be detected. All
you have to do is to secure old

is obvious, will be fast and

(For Ladies only.)
DEAREST_ETHELINPA-We had a delightful drive down from
London to Kempton Park, and I felt quite Watteau-like as I looked
on the lilacs, laburnums, and chestnut trees en route. I did not
cccupy the box seat, because Mrs. PLANTAGENET-NuBBs, who really
gets more passée and more assertive every day of her life, claimed
that position. But, as I told Lord ARTHUR, who laughed hearily,
it does not do to contest the claims of those who are approaching
fin de demi-siècle. The other members of our ty consisted of
Lady TypINA TIPCAT (own aunt to the Duke of BATTLEDoRE and
SHUTTLEcoCK), Sir WILLoughby WEAR, Q.C. (who bored everybody
by his }.} broad references to the Divorce Court, where I firmly
believe he lives with Sir FRANCIs JEUNE), Mr. Swinburn E JENKINs,
the poet (whose acquaintance you will remember I made at the
Eldorado Music-hall), Mr. and Mrs. NIBBLETHoRPE Nobbes, of
Nobbes Hall, Staffordshire, not young, but rich and bucolic, Baron
STEwART DE TozA, a Portuguese gentleman with a cast of feature
not unlike that of the late Lord BEAconsfield (by birth, he told me,
that he was a compatriot of CAMoENs, but by instinct a Scotchman,
his mother being a member of the noble fami y of MACDUNIwassFL).
and Mr. and Miss KAMP-TULIcon (his sister), Mr. K-T. being, as I
understand, an owner of fossil ivory mines in Siberia. Certainly
both he and Miss K.-T. had most exquisite false teeth. In fact,
our party was an olla podrida, or rather bouillabaisse of humanity, a
ſhat a wondrous place is Kempton! Imagine, ma toute belle, a
glorious pleasaunce (wherein I am told Queen ELIZABETH, in the
days of her spinsterhood and threatened by horrible forecasts, used
to ramble), dotted with magnificent trees, and adorned with exquisite
places of vantage, called in racing parlance “stands!” Flowers
were to be seen on all sides, and the Prince of WALEs had luncheon
in a pavilion which the Sultan of TURREY, or the late lamented
Shah of PERSIA, might have envied. Lord ARTHUR introduced me,
when we were strolling to the Paddock, to a very handsome gentle-
man with merry eyes and a débonnair aspect; he was none other, I
ascertained, than Mr. S. H. HYDE, the presiding genius of this great
show, which Aladdin would not have been ashamed to bring to
the notice of the Princess of China." Well,” he asked, pleasantly,
“what do you think of Kempton?” “It ought to be called Hydé
Park,” I replied, with a curtsey. The manager blushed and hurried
away, while dear Lord ARTHUR congratulated me on what he called
my "d propos mot.” . And yet I hoped that Mr. HYDE would not
hold me tº be unmaidenly in giving out a calembour which in-
stinctively leapt to the tip of my tongue, as did Venus from the sea.
I .#, dearest, that you could have seen the toilettes in the
Club inclosure. Mr. Sw1NBURNE JENKINs says, that they reminded
him of a bevy of startled, peacocks. His simile is not altogether
without verisimilitude. . The delicate bloom of the egg-plum, the
yerdant hue of the early pea, and the assertive, tint, of the ripe
tomato, mingled in more than one costume with the colours orange,

Well of words may I be thrifty, with a hundred votes and fifty,
Ready, howsoever shifty be my schemes, to seal and bind
Every oracle I utter! If you think my calm you'll flutter

And when stout Sir WiLLIAM wakes him with a question of this kind,
He will yawn out “Never mind!”
TIPS FOR TRADERS.
(See the Report of our Consul at Cherbourg.)
ALWAYS start with the assumption that you are doing a very con-
descending act in allowing the dratted foreigner to purchase any of
your coal, iron, shirtings, chemicals, or whatever it may be.
Never take the trouble to translate your trade circulars into any
foreign tongue. To make out their meaning will be a useful lesson
in English for the poor jabbering Frenchman, Italian, or Teuton.
Bearing in mind that the decimal system prevails in France, quote
which this will cause to your (possible), French customers will be a
fitting return for their nastiness about Egypt, Siam, &c.
Remember that the only dignified international attitude to adopt
to an obviously inferior race is to fling your goods down, and say,
“Take them or leave them ' " This is what makes Englishmen so
popular on the Continent. -
As the German firms that compete with you take, great care to
send *...* and polyglottic young men to push their goods in
France, you had better send nobody, but manage everything by
correspondence-in English, of course.
If you do forget yourself so far as to despatch a traveller abroad,
be very careful to pick out a person who knows no French, and less
German, and who will make it quite plain to everybody he meets
that he considers English the only “language” in the world, all the
others being “lingos.” -
Don't yield to the nonsense of Consuls, and other ignorant Fº
who tell you that to gain the custom of foreigners you must dro
some of 3. own. Don't “stoop to conquer.” Brusquerie an
business, bad manners and good trade, are intimately allied.
Lastly, if you do manage to get an order abroad, give as much
trouble to your customer asyou cant by leaving him to arrange for pay-
ment of customs dues, delivery, and soon. It will do him good. Most
foreigners are very lazy, and you should try and cure them of this trait.

JOTTINGS AND TITTLINGS.
(By BABoo HURRY BuNGsHo JABBERJRR, B.A.)
No. XIII.
Drawbacks and advantages of being engaged. Some Meditations in
a Music-hall, together with notes ſ certain things that Mr.
Jabberjee failed to understand.
My preceding article announced the important intelligence of my
betrothal, in which I was then too much the neophyte to express any
yery opinionated judgment as to the pros or cons of my approaching
benediction as a Benedick (if I may be allowed a º: umorous
un).
L'a?pétit vient en mangeant, and I am blessing my stars more
fervidly every day for the lucky windfall which has bolted upon me
from the blue.
All the select boarders were speedily in-
formed of my engagement, and the males,
though profuse in their congratulations, did
manifest their green-eyed monster by sun-
dry, veiled, chucklings, and rib-pokings,
while the ladies—especially, Miss SPINR—
are become less pressing in their attentions,
and address me as “Prince” with increased
frequency, and in a tone of tittering
acidulation.
.This, however, is attributable to natural
disappointment; for it was notorious that
all of them, even the least prepossessing,
were on the tiptoe of languishing expec-
tancy that I should cast my handkerchief
in one of their directions. But the feminine
nature is not capable of sustaining the good-
fortune of another member of their sex with
good-humoured complacency!
On the other hand, I enjoy many privi-
leges and bonuses. I am permitted to enter
Mrs. MANKLETow's private parlour ad libi-
tum, and there converse with my beloved,
ng her “JEssIE,” and, even, embrace
her in moderation. I may also embrace her
Mother, and address her as “Mamma,”
which affords me raptures of a less tumul-
tuous kind.
Moreover now, when I conduct my inamo-
rati to an en inment, it is no longer de
rigueur for any third party to impersonate
a gooseberry!
The mention of entertainments reminds
me that, a few, evenings ago, I escorted her
to a music-hall, wherein, although I had
previously believed myself a past master in
the shibboleth of London eyisms and
technical terminology, I heard and saw
much which was au bout de mon Latin,
and the head impossible to be made out of
the tail.
E.g., there were two young lady-per-
formers alleged by the prºgramme to be
“Serios and Bone Soloists,” whereas they
were the reverse of 1 rious; nor were
their physiognomies fleshlessor osseous; but,
on the contrary, so shapely and well-favoured that JEssIE did remon-
strate with me upon the perseverance with which I gazed at them.
And I could not *all find anyºn; to explain to me the difference
between a “Comedian" and a “Comic”; or a “Comedian and
Patterer” and an “Eccentric Comedian”; or a “Society Belle”
and a “Burlesque Artiste”; or, again, “A Sketch Artiste” and a
"Speciality, Dancer.” For to me they seemed all precisely similar.
There were “four º: Lyric Sisters,” who performed a dance
in long expansive skirts, and in conclusion did turn heels-over-
head in º but this, it seems, was, contrary to my
expectancy, not to dance a speciality. Speaking for my humble
#: I am respectfully of opinion that lovely woman loses in queenly
ignity by the abrupt execution of a somersault; however, the feat
did indubitably excite vociferous applause from the spectators.
Further there appeared a couple of Duettists in ordinary evening
habiliments, who sang in unison with egregious melodiousness. One
was plump as a partridge; the other thun as a weasel; and they
related how they were both the adorers of a certain lovely damsel
called “SALLY,” who was the darling of their co-operative hearts,
and resided in their Alley. And of all the days in the week they
dearly loved Sunday, because then they were dressed in all their best,
and went for a walk with SALLY.
I shºuld have thought that it was not humanly feasible for SALLY
to continue such periodical promenades without exhibiting some pre-
“In garbage of unparagoned shabbiness.”
ferential kind of choice, either for the partridge or the weasel, and
that such a triangular courtship and triple alliance would infallibly
terminate in the apple of discord, but #.EssIE did assure me that it
was quite usual and the correct cheese for a girl to have more than
one beau upon her :*. -
I made the further observation that the Comedians and Comics
must be reduced to extreme pauperism, since they presented them-
selves before a well- , respectable audience in garbage of
unparagoned shabbiness, and with hair of unbrushed wildness, and
needing immediate tonsure. -
One songster did offer some excuse for the poverty of his appear-
ance, telling us his hard case, how that he was occupied in declaring
his passion to a beauteous damsel, when she was “all over him in
a minute,” and, while he was making love to the pretty stars above,
she cleared out all his pockets in a minute! At which man
laughed; but, though Jove is said to regard lovers' perjuries wi
- cachinnation, I could not help feeling the
- most pitiable sympathy for such a disap-
pointing conclusion to a love affair, seein
that it is impossible for the comeliest nymp
who returns her admirer's devotion by
stealing his purse, and similar trash, to
remain posed any longer upon the towering
pedestal of an ideal. Upon making this
remark to JESSIE, however, she uttered the
repartee that I was the silly noodle; though
she is, I am sure, notwithstanding her
attachment to gewgaws, not capable cf
- jºins personally to such light-fingered
7 tactics.
I was additionally bewildered by a chorus
chanted by one of the Society Belles, which
I took down verbatim, in the hope of a solu-
tion. It was as follows: “For I like a good
liar, indeed I do! Provided he comes out
with something new I But why did he tell
j *: story with whiskers on, why, why,
Wny
Now to me it is wholly incomprehensible
that the female intelligence should admire
mendacity in the opposite sex on the sole
conditions that the said liar should present
himself in some novel article of attire, and,
reviously to relating his untruth, remove
rom his cheeks any hirsute appendages.
One of the boarders whom I consulted on
the subject attempted to persuade me that
it was the story that had the whiskers; but
it is nonsensical to suppose that a purely
abstract affair like an untruth, could be
furnished with capillary growth, which
belongs to the concrete department. -
There was a lady described as an “in-
comparable Comedienne,” who was the
yictim of unexampled bad luck. For she
had purchased a camera (which, she exhi-
bited to the assembly), and with this she
had gone about photographing landscapes
and other sceneries. . But, lack-a-daisyl no
sooner were they printed than the pictures
were discovered to be irretrievably spoilt
by objects in the foreground of such doubt-
ful propriety that they were not exactly fit to place among her
brick-backs, so she was compelled to keep them in a drawer among
her knick-nacks!
I should have liked her to inform us where such a faulty
mechanism was procured, and why she did not exchange it for one of
"g. competency,
he was succeeded on the stage by a little girl with a hoop, who
bore a striking resemblance to her predecessor, and was probably her
infantile daughter. This child was evidently of a greatly inquisitive
disposition, and asked many questions of her progenitors which they
were unable to answer, bidding her not to bother, and to go away
and play.
Then she asked a juvenile boy (who remained invisible), called
“John NY Jones,” and informed us that “she knew now.” But I
was still in the total darkness as to the answers, which even JEssIE
declared that she was “Davus, non (Edipus,” and not able to provide
with the correct solutions. -- -
Upon the whole, I am of opinion that music-halls are more fertile in
mental puzzlement and social problems, and more difficult of
comprehension, than theatrical entertainments.
. This is, no doubt, why the spectators are allowed to consume
liquors and sandwiches throughout the performance, since it is well
known that the brain cannot carry on its modus operands with
efficiency if the stomach is in the beggarly array of an empty box!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
EASTBOURNE FOR THE CZAR
(By our Trusted Reporter.)
In obedience to your instructions, “to keep my eye on the
Coronation of the Emperor of Russia,” I proceeded on Monday,
May 18, to Eastbourne. I found the place en fête. The streets
were thronged with people; from house to house, from pole
to pole, hung a profusion of paper-flowers., There were stands
on the Grand Parade, and bunting everywhere. Also a first-
rate band supported in an alcove over the sad sea waves.
“What is the event of the day?” I asked, after a careful
ection of the decorations.
“The Gymkhana in the South Fields at 1.30,” was the
immediate reply.
Then I worried about this explanation. “The Gymkhanal”
What on earth was it? It sounded like an Eastern potentate,
or a delicious rival to “rahat lakoum.” But why should a swarthy
monarch goto the South Fields at lunch-time? Or why should
an oriental sweetstuff be there distributed at such an hour?
Perhaps for tiffin. Pleasant recollection. Tiffin another name
for midday meal. Lunch!
I had bought a local paper.
Among the advertisements was
much about a certain hotel. I would trust to the praises of the
réclames. I went, I saw, and was conquered. d not get a
table near the window. Had to wait twenty minutes for a steak.
Found a hole in the table-cloth, and successfully contested the
total of the bill.
Out of temper. Renewed search for “Gymkhana.” I wan-
dered, until at length I arrived (outside the town) at the
skeletons of about a square mile of booths. I asked elderly
individual for explanation.
“Not know what that is!” he exclaimed, in an ecstasy of
astonishment. And then he told me; but mfortunately I have
forgotten what he said. Ifancy the booths were for agricultural
show, or steeple-chases, or international exhibition, or something
or other. ºt, at any rate, they were not intended for the
-- ana.
'Why, Aurely the South Fields are yonder,” continued the
elderly individual. And so they were. And in them I found
the object of my search. All the aristocracy, gentry,and in-
habitants.(more or less) of Eastbourne, and its vicinity, were
scattered in a meadow watching the skill of some yeomanry and
volunteers. The Gymkhana was a provincial edition of the
Military Tournament at Islington.
As I approached, two gallant cavalry men of the auxiliaries
were attempting to thump one another with single-sticks, but
their cautious chargers knew better, and declined to take the
champions within striking distance. The horses seemed of a

superior breed to those accustomed to the shafts of a bathing-
machine, or the burdens imposed on the animal let out at sixpence an
hour at Hampstead on a bank holiday. But for all that, and all
that, the brutes were so obstinate, that they would have been the
better for the chastisement of a cane-bearing donkey boy. The
Yeomanry won their prizes amidst the attention of the snap-shot
photographers and the cheers of the mighty multitude. Then came
performance of massed bands, and Monday ended in harmony.
Tuesday was devoted to “Battle of Flowers,” and “State Proces-
sion ºf décorated Coaches, Carriages, and Equestrians in Costume.”
The last was pleasing, the first fairly, exhilarating. The horses
and ponies looked more dignified than their drivers, and the contest
with confetti conjured back Nice and Naples—of course, with a
difference.
But space runs short. During the remainder of the week the
Australian cricketers played at the Saffrons, and there were a pro-
cession of cyclists in grotesque costumes, a military ºoncert, and a
fancy-dress ball in Devonshire Park. Then, to conclude the six days
with a blaze of triumph, Saturday ended with an “illuminated fite
and fireworks.” And now I have described the manner in which the
CzAR's coronation was celebrated at Eastbourne.

ToM Hood As A Port,
(Concluded)
Of “The Song of the Shirt” and “The
Bridge of Sighs” it is not sonece to speak,
for even the greater public, who look upon
Hood as a punning humorist, know that he
was responsible for these two cries of suffer-
ing and indignation which have echoed and
re-echoed through the years. Yet it is a
high privilege for one who writes in Punch
to remember that “The Song of the Shirt.”
first appealed from these pages to the sym-
pathy of the world.
BUT a word must be said of Hood the
know him in this character to the “Ole to
Rae Wilson, Esquire.” In this piece Hood
uses, all his gifts, his word-twisting power,
his fierce indignation. his humble piety, his
tolerant charity, his rhyme, his rhythm-all
are there. It is full of lines that must live.
I pray for grace, repent each sinful act—
Peruse, but underneath the rose, my Bible;
And love my neighbour, far too well, in fact,
To call and twit him with a godly tract
That's turned by application to a libel.
º heartferments not with the bigot's leaven.
All creeds I yiew with toleration thorough,
And have a horror of regarding heaven
As anybody's rotten borough.
AND here again—
I do not hash the gospel in my books,
As if I thought, like Otaheitan cooks,
No food was fit to eat till I had chewed it.
But the whole piece teems with such flashes
of wit, and there are passages of noble poetry
in it; as, for example, the lines beginning
One place there is–beneath the burial sod–
which prove again, if any further proof were
needed, ToM Hood's title “to find honour-
able mention in any recital of the names of
those who have contributed to the stock of

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
ToM Hood As A Port.
(Concluded)
Of “The Song of the Shirt” and
Bridge of Sighs” it is not sonece to speak,
for even the greater public, who look upon
Hood as a Running humorist, know that he
was responsible for these two cries of suffer-
ing and indignation which have echoed and
re-echoed through the years. Yet it is a
high privilege for one who writes in Punch
to remember that “The Song of the Shirt”
first appealed from these pages to the sym-
pathy of the world.
BUT a word must be said of Hood the
“The are there." It is full of
know him in this charac'er to the “Ole to
Rae Wilson, Esquire.” In this piece Hood
uses, all his gifts, his word-twisting prwe',
his fierce indignation. his humble piety, his
tolerant charity, his rhyme, his rhythm-all
ines that must live.
I pray for grace, repent each sinful act—
Peruse, but underneath the rose, my Bible;
And love my neighbour, far too well, in fact,
To call and twit him with a godly tract
That's turned by application to a libel.
º heartferments not with the bigot's leaven.
All creeds Iyiew with toleration thorough,
And have a horror of regarding heaven
As anybody's rotten borough.
AND here again—
I do not hash the gospel in my books,
As if I thought, like Otaheitan cooks,
No food was fit to eat till I had chewed it.
But the whole piece teems with such flashes
of wit, and there are passages of noble poetry
in it; as, for example, the lines beginning
One place there is–beneath the burial sod-
which prove again, if any further proof were
needed, Tom Hood's title “to find honour-
able mention in any recital of the names of
those who have contributed to the stock of
genuine English Poetry.”

With orchid to buttonhole handy.

straightway Don Josſ, GEORGE CURzoN, or, as happened the other

he said he'd given private notice. This, it turned out, was a note

describing Rating Bill as barefaced piece of plunder promoted by
those who would derive pecuniary advantage from it, struck with
resounding thud. Up jumped SQUIRE in towering rage. What
follows is taken from Parliamentary report:
Mr. CHAPLIN: Do you impute motive?
Mr. Thomas: No; I do not. -
Mr. CHAPLIN: Do you impute any motive P
Mr. Thomas: That is not the actual motive, but—-
“But me no buts!” roared the SQUIRE, still sticking to SHAK-
sPEARIAN, form. Thereupon, seizing, DAVID by the scruff of the
neck, he §§ him up to Chair, and proposed a caning. (This, of
course, in Parliamentary sense.) -

and the bubbling steam collapsed. - - -

“Certainly," said the Chairman, with freezing blandness. “But
I did not understand that the hon. Member had imputed motive.”

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, May 18, "Don't you think you
is are a trifle hard on Široºroº, said Sanº. “iknow he is a
ittle ludicrous, and usually in bad form. But I’m grateful to him
for reviving memories of early boyhood. Remember when, I was
taken to pantomime for first glorious time, the thing that made
sharpest and most "...º.º. on my mind was the inoffen-
sive, well-meaning, middle-aged gentleman, who, as soon as he
appeared on the stage, was incontinently knocked down. SILoMio
is the pantaloon of our Parliamentary scene. Steps on with imposing
stride, makes portentous remark, usually in form of question;
straightway Don Josſ, GEORGE CUBzoN, or, as happened the other
night, PRINCE ARTHUR, gives him a backhander, and he lies sprawl-
ing amid contumelious laughter.
“Same in last Parliament, when he considerably helped to make
fortunes of those promising Under Secretaries Edward GREY and
SYDNEY Buxton, Let us remember the good in contemplating the
bad. Parliament monotonously dreary just now. Let us be thankful
that SILoMIo declined overtures made to him last year by his black
brethren, i.º.º. to wear light clothing and rule over
a principality in Central Africa.”
t was Don José who to-night touched up with the Parliamen
red-hot poker the patriotic Member for Eccleshall division of Sheffiel
SILoMo, put two questions about South African affairs, of which
he said he’d given private notice. This, it turned out, was a note
thrust in Don Josf's hand as he entered House. Reasonable rule
requires that. Ministers shall have full notice of question. Rule
more imperative in view of the importance and nicety of foreign
affairs. Don José begged his honourable friend to observe this rule.
Opposition jeered at prostrate figure. SILoMIo, scrambling on to
feet, *. to continue conversation. House roared contume-
hº ILOMIo used to that.
“May I be allowed to explain?” he shouted.
SPEAKER thought not...More howling., SILoMIo drop into his
seat. Up again, facing the storm with flushed face and angry eye-
lass. Wanted to know whether he was to understand that the
emand made upon him by Don Josſ referred to appointments made
by himself, of which he must have ample knowledge?
“The hon: gentleman,” said Don José, coldly, "will of course act
on his own discretion.”
If...there is ºne light in the constellation of SILoMIo's sterling
qualities that shines with stronger, mellower light than another, it is
his discretion. The shaft went home, and for the evening SH-9Mio
whether, after all, he was wise to give up to Westminster what was
meant for the Gºld Coast. -
Business done.—Agricultural Rating Bill in Committee.
Tuesday.—Curious how through everyday life runs echo of the
voice of the Divine WILLIAMs. “Do you bite your thumb at us?”
asked Abram, in the conversation between the Montague and the
Capulet retainers.
Sampson. I do bite my thumb, Sir.
Abram. Do you bite your thumb at us, Sir?
Sampson. Is the law on our side, if I say—ay ?
Gregory. No.
Sampson. No, Sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, Sir; but I bite my
thumb, Sir.
Compare the passage with a little conversation that took place
just now between Squire of BLANKNEY and DAVID AP Thomas.
Avin had been slinging stones at fº on Treasury Bench. One,
describing Rating Bill as barefaced piece of plunder promoted by
those who would derive pecuniary advantage from it, struck with
resounding thud. Up jumped SQUIRE in towering rage. What
follows is taken from Parliamentary report:
Mr. CHAPLIN: Do you impute motive?
Mr. Thomas: No; I do not. -
Mr. CHAPLIN: Do you impute any motive P
Mr. Thomas: That is not the actual motive, but—-
“But me no buts l’ roared the SQUIRE, still sticking to SHAK-
speARIAN, form. Thereupon... seizing, DAVID by the scruff of the
neck, he dragged him up to Chair, and proposed a caning. (This, of
course, in Parliamentary sense.)
Things looking lively till Chairman squirted stream of cold water,
and the bubbling steam collapsed. -
“I wish to ask you, Sir,” said the SQUIRE, giving his knuckles
an adroit turn between favn's neck and the collar of his coat,
“whether it is not contrary to the Rules of the House for one hon.
Member tº imputemºtivº another?.
“Certainly,” said the Chairman, with freezing blandness. “But
I did not understand that the hon. Member had imputed motive.”

having a taste of what we in Ireland used to get when your PRINCE
ARTHUR ruled at Dublin Castle. The liberal minority have got a
dab of Coercion, and I hope they like it.”
Business done.-PRINCE ARTHUR astonishes the Opposition.
Wednesday.—Birthday honours have fallen lightly on House of
Commons. All the three new Peers were with us once. The MARKIs
o' GRANBY left of own free will at close of last Parliament. As he
will in due course become Duke of RUTLAND, it seems waste of
good, material to make him a Peer. SARK says he knows a
uarter in which peerage might have been more usefully bestowed.
IENEAGE, we lost amid crash of general election; completed a
distinguished, career by losing Unionist seat when Unionists tri-
umphed all along the line. Some curiosity as to what title he will
adopt. Below Gangway, where he used to sit, it is said he will
become Baron SMIKF. hy, I don't know. Doesn’t seem parti-
cularly nice title. Then there's Colonel MALCOLM, known in choirs
and places where they sing as Poltai.T.ſ CH. A model Highland
Chief is dear PoltaLLoch, one after Sir WALTER Scott's own heart,
i. for Argyllshire for six years, a man as good as he is good-
Ooklng.
Still with us in Commons is PENRose-FITzGERALD, hereafter Sir
RoBERT-Sir Robert UNIACKE PENRose-FrizGERALD. Naturally
when Home Rule became burning question PENRose declared
against it. - -
“Pronounced how you like,” said he, “U-N-I-A-C-K-E spells
Unionist.”
It was PENRoss, who for a moment abashed even the CAP'EN.
Once, when the Old Salt had taken charge of debate in the House,
he invited FITzGERALD to lend a hand.
“No,” said the unconsciously budding Baronet, “I’m not going
to take my orders from a spit-to-win'nard admiral.”
It is to be hoped his new dignity will bring Sir LEwis McIver,
B.B.K., again to the front in Parliamentary debate. In the short
Parliament of 1886 he sat just long enough to show rare debating
ower. , Has been silent in this Parliament; must not die with all
is music in him.
Business done.-In Committee on Rating Bill.
T Friday, 1.30 P.M.–Just adjourned for the holidays, after sitting
that lacked only hour and a half to round off the full day. Began
quietly enough. When we met yesterday, at three o'clock, PRINCE
ARTHUR said, “I’m going to get Agricultural Rating Bill through
Committee before you go home.”
“No, you don't,” said the Opposition.
PRINCE ARTHUR did, but the cost was considerable, Gentlemen
of England who go to bed at ease, and get fresh flavour out of mild
morning bacon, on opening paper to discover House has been sitting
all night, think it's fine fun. So it is, though amusement is divide
after manner of frogs at bottom of well and boys pelting them from
above. What’s fun to outside public is death to some ºf those who
Debating the “Relief Bill”! (5.30 a.m.) Loud Ministerial Snores!
live through dreary watches of night, see the dawn break, and peg
along into another day, bathless and breakfastless.
“Whom the gods love get suspended early,” said SQUIRE of
MALwood, as, about half-past three this morning, JoBN DILLON and
four others left the House under circumstances of compulsion. “Much
the best way out of it. You flout the Chairman or SPEAKER; are
“named’; resolution to suspend you from service of House is solemnly
made; division takes place; you march out with all honours of
war; comfortably 'go to bed, leaving us here to fight on to the
THE LITTLE VISITOR FROM TOWN.
“FAN cy, AUNTIE, I HEARD THE NIGHTINGALE say "Cookoo’l”
of Opposition, bound to avoid so-called undignified situation, when-
ever I saw all-night sitting setting in, should get º suspended;
and, as PEPys occasionally remarked, so home to bed.”
DILLON and his friends comfortably tucked in, we went at it
again; wºrried on till noon; someone remembered we had arranged
to meet at that hour to commence new sitting. Where were we?
Is to-day to-morrow, or was it merely, yesterday?, No one, quite
certain. Seemed every prospect that, when we finish this coil, will
begin quite fresh one. PRINCE ARTHUR, seeing opportunity, struck
bargain with House,
“Pass Agricultural Rating Bill through Committee,” he said,
“and we'll say nothing about what should be Friday's business.”
So it was settled. Thursday ran into Friday, obliterating it.
There was no Friday's sitting, as solemnly arranged yesterday.

one this afternoon, with hazy consciousness of having been there, and
thereabouts, since three o'clock *...}. -
Business done.—Rating Bill carried through Committee. Ad-

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
My BROTHER-IN-LAW,
THIs is the story, so far as it has gone, of a real brother-in-law,
whom for the sake of convenience I shall consider as mine, while for
the same reason I naturally assume myself to have married his
sister, and (though, not perhaps so naturally) to have been for some
ºld in life as a barrister with a large and increasing
practice.
WHEN I married ALICE, it was explained to me, both by the dear
girl herself, and by all her relatives, that one of their chief joys in
assenting to the match lay in the fact that henceforth little HARRY
would have a natural guardian and protector. Little HARRY, the
brother-in-law in question, was then a stripling of sixteen or
seventeen, the age which makes a boy painfully conscious of the
awkwardness of his hands, afflicts him with a furious desire to dress
in the most marked extravagance of the latest fashion, and, if he
happens to possess a father, fills him with shame over the hopeless
cut of his parent's trousers, and the antiquated shape of his parent's
top hat. If HARRY had possessed a father, all would have been well,
but death had removed this prosperous merchant from the scene
some ten years before ALICE accompanied me to the altar. By a
curious freak, which I have never been able to explain, all her chief
surviving relatives were of her own sex, and it was therefore assumed
that iſ should not only make a home for ALICE, but also act in all
respects as a father to HARRY.
For a time all went well. HARRY was at Eton, and only came to
us during his holidays. Later on he went to Cambridge, and then
our troubles began. I must explain that, by his father's will, a small,
but sufficient, annual allowance had been provided for him until he
should come of age, at which time he was to come into the possession of
some thirty thousand pounds absolutely.__HARRY is one of the most
good-natured young men in the world... Nothing delights him more
than to see all his friends, enjoying themselves, and feasting and
revelling at his expense. All his clothes were beautiful; his smok-
ing suits were a dream; he played polo in white linen breeches and
beautiful brown boots. His bedroom was littered with a hundred
ties of every degree of gorgeousness; his toilet table was brilliant
with his jewellery. The result of all this was that, before two years
were out, he was in debt to various tradesmen in the sum of two
thousand pounds; and, at a family conclave, it was resolved that
º was not the place for him, and that some other step must
eIl,
WE, resolved, therefore, to send him to an army tutor, whose
establishment was situated in a quiet part of the country, and who
held himself out not only as the provider of a happy home, but also
as a strict disciplinarian. In two months. HARRY had set the
country-side on fire by his own exploits and those of his dogs, and it
became necessary, for prudential reasons, to remove him. In three
months more he came of age, and startled us with the intelligence
that he was off to Monte Carlo. We protested in vain. He put us
aside with a smile, and started. Shortly afterwards we learnt from
paragraphs in the World that “a young Englishman, said to be a
near relative of a successful barrister, who lately contested a north
country borough in the Conservative interest,” had had an extraordi-
nary run of luck at the trente et quarante tables, that the bank had
been practically broken, and that all Monte Carlo was marvelling at
the audacity of this young player. As it turned out. it was none
other than HARRY. ALIgE was quite proud of him. “There,” she
said, “you always said the º a fool—but I knew better. If
he can win money against all those clever people at Monte Carlo he
can't be a fool.” She wrote and congratulated him; and I must
confess that, in a quiet way, I was rather pleased m self when some
of my friends rallied me in Court about the fortune of my
brother-in-law, and suggested that I should follow his brilliant
example. In another month HARRY returned to us, minus twenty
thousand pounds.
..HE then said he was going to be a business man, and that some of
his friends had put him into a real good thing. He gave us all
beautiful presents, made my house his home, had a special breakfast
at twelve o'clock in the morning, sauntered about town, visited all
the race meetings, came home at the most unearthly hours, and in
three months had been reduced to his last penny. The next sugges-
tion made for his benefit was that he should try his fortune, in
British Columbia. He was away for a year, during which, according
to his own account, he was six times on the verge of becoming a
millionaire, by means of silver mines. Something, however, always
happened, to prevent this desirable consummation; his, partners
swindled him, the government refused in the most dastardly fashion
to make the necessary roads, the weather prevented work, the town
was overwhelmed by a landslip, or the legislation of the United
States ruined the silver industry. Whatever may have been the
reason, my amiable brother-in-law returned as he went out, bringing
home nothing but a large stock of strange oaths, a pronounced taste
for inferior varieties of whiskey, and a shadowy claim to some twenty
thousand acres of barren land in British Columbia.
(To be continued.)
THE HIGH-METTLED RACER.
[It is said that 6000 old horses have been imported into Belgium from
England in one year, and afterwards killed and converted into tinned meat.]
EH P “The high-mettled racer is sold for the hounds?”
Nay, not whilst the Spirit of Commerce abounds !
He ran for the Derby, he crawled in a cab,
But not yet the horse-knacker his carcase shall nab ;
Not yet shall the hounds or the ji. part
His broken-down body, his plucky old heart. .
Still money, if not Cups and Stakes, he may win.
The high-mettled racer is packed up in tin.
A potted Bucephalus yet has his price! -
The notion is new, though it hardly sounds nice.
He won lots of cash when yºung, handsome and fleet,
And now he'll still turn in the “tin”—as tinned meat.
Not cat's-meat!, Oh, no! Pack him up in a can,
And the horse, though no more, shall still nourish the man.
Despatch him to Belgium, when past all relief
And the high-mettled racer returns-as tinned beef!
PRE-DERBY PRIERE.-The starting of Regret is (according to a
telegram from the Duke of WESTMINSTER, published in the Sports-
man last Saturday) to depend on the rain. If he does, start, his
place will also, to a certain extent, depend ºn the rein, and the hand
that guides it. May Jupiter Pluvius be favourable!. May Regret
be in for the struggle, and not be “hors de combat”! And may
the Duke not have to exclaim, “Regret is useless!”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
NOMENCLATURE.
Errand Boy. "Lok I Wor's 'Is NAME, I wonDER! Boorlaoss?”
ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
My BROTHER-IN-LAw.
THIs is the story, so far as it has gone, of a real brother-in-law,
whom for the sake of convenience I shall consider as mine, while for
the same reason I naturally assume myself to have married his
sister, and (though, not perhaps so naturally) to have been for some
ºned in life as a barrister with a large and increasing
practice.
WHEN I married ALICE, it was explained to Fº: by the dear |E
girl herself, and by all her relatives, that one of their chief joys in
assenting to the match lay in the fact that henceforth little HARRY
would have a natural guardian and protector. Little HARRY, the
brother-in-law in question, was then a stripling of sixteen or
seventeen, the age which makes a boy painfully conscious of the
awkwardness of his hands, afflicts him with a furious desire to dress
in the most marked extravagance of the latest fashion, and, if he
happens to possess a father, fills him with shame over the hopeless
cut of his parent's trousers, and the antiquated shape of his parent's
top hat. If HARRY had possessed a father, all would have been well,
but death had removed this prosperous merchant from the scene
some ten years before ALICE accompanied me to the altar. By a
curious freak, which I have never been able to explain, all her chief
surviving relatives were of her own sex, and it was therefore assumed
that iſ should not only make a home for ALICE, but also act in all
respects as a father to HARRY.
For a time all went well. HARRY was at Eton, and only came to
us during his holidays. Later on he went to Cambridge, and then
our troubles began. "I must explain that, by his father's will, a small,
but sufficient, annual allowance had been provided for him until he
should come of age, at which time he was to come into the possession of
some thirty thousand pounds absolutely.__HARRY is one of the most
good-natured young men in the world. Nothing delights him more
than to see all his friends enjoying themselves, and feasting and
revelling at his expense., All his clothes were beautiful; his smok:
ing suits were a dream; he played polo in white linen breeches and
beautiful brown boots. His bedroom was littered with a hundred
ties of every degree of gorgeousness; his toilet table was brilliant
with his jewellery. The result of all this was that, before two years
were out, he was in debt to various tradesmen in the sum of two
thousand pounds; and, at a family conclave, it was resolved that
º was not the place for him, and that some other step must
en,
WE. resolved, therefore, to send him to an army tutor, whose
establishment was situated in a quiet part of the country, and who
held himself out not only as the provider of a happy home, but also
as a strict disciplinarian. In two months, HARRY had set the
country-side on fire by his own exploits and those of his dogs, and it
became necessary, for prudential reasons, to remove him. in three
months more he came of age, and startled us with the intelligence
that he was off to Monte Carlo. We protested in vain. , He put us
aside with a smile, and started. Shortly afterwards we learnt from
paragraphs in the World that, “a young Englishman, said to be a
near relative of a successful barrister, who lately contested a north
country borough in the Conservative interest,” had had an extraordi-
nary run of luck at the trente et quarante tables, that the bank had
been practically broken, and that all Monte Carlo was marvelling at
the audacity of this young player. As it turned out, it was none
other than HARRY. ALICE was quite proud of him. “There,” she
said, “you always said the boy was a fool—but I knew better. If
he can win money against all those clever people at Monte Carlo he
can't be a fool.” She wrote and congratulated him; and I must
confess that, in a quiet way, I was rather pleased m self when some
of my friends rallied me in Court, about the fortune of my
brother-in-law, and suggested that I should follow his brilliant
example. In another month HARRY returned to us, minus twenty
thousand pounds.
HE then said he was going to be a business man, and that some of
his friends had put him into a real good thing. He gave us all
beautiful presents, made my house his home, had a special breakfast
at twelve o'clock in the morning, sauntered about town, visited all
the race meetings, came home at the most unearthly hours, and in
three months had been reduced to his last penny... The next sugges-
tion made for his benefit was that he should try his fortune in
British Columbia. He was away for a year, during which, according
to his own account, he was six times on the verge of becoming a
millionaire by means of silver mines. Something, however, always
happened, to prevent this desirable, consummation; , his, partners
swindled him, the government refused in the most dastardly fashion
to make the necessary roads, the weather *:::::: work, the town
was overwhelmed by a landslip, or the legislation of the United
States ruined the silver industry. Whatever may have been the
reason, my amiable brother-in-law returned as he went out, bringing
home nothing but a large stock of strange oa a pronounced taste
for inferior varieties of whiskey, and a º aim to some twenty
thousand acres of barren land in British Columbia.
(To be continued.)
THE HIGH-METTLED RACER.
[It is said that 6000 old horses have been imported into Belgium from
ngland in one year, and afterwards killed and converted into tinned meat.]
EHP “The high-mettled racer is sold for the hounds?”
Nay, not whilst the Spirit of Commerce abounds !
He ran for the Derby, he crawled in a cab,
But not yet the horse-knacker his carcase shall nab ;
Not yet shall the hounds or the º: part
His broken-down body, his plucky old heart. .
Still money, if not Cups and Stakes, he may win.
The high-mettled racer is packed up in tin.
A potted Bucephalus yet has ś. -
The notion is new, though it hardly sounds nice.
He won lots of cash when yºung, handsome and fleet,
And now he'll still turn in the “tin”—as tinned meat.
Not cat's-meat!, Oh, no! Pack him up in a can,
And the horse, though no more, shall still nourish the man.
Despatch him to Belgium, when past all relief
*:::the high-mettled racer returns-as tinned beef!
PRE-DERBY PRIERE.-The starting of Regret is (according to a
telegram from the Duke of WESTMINstER published in the Sports-
man last Saturday) to depend on the rain. If he does, start, his
place will also, to a certain extent, depend on the rein, and the hand
that guides it. May Jupiter Pluvius be favourable!, May Regret
be in for the struggle, and not be “hors de combat”. And may
the Duke not have to exclaim, “Regret is uselessl”

“Make hay–of the bowling! the trundler may sigh.
Ah well, so he will, whilst the wickets keep dry;

THE OLD LOVE AND THE NEW.
“For 0, for 0, the hobby-horse is forgot!”
SCENE-The Stables at $4ddlºpings, the WHEELERs' Country House
near Bykersall. Miss DIANA's Horse, “Bayard,” discovered
in his Stall.
Bayard (talking to himself, as is the habit of somehorses when alone).
I can't make it out. She's here. All the family came down yester-
day—I heard the omnibus start for the station to meet them. And
yet she hasn't sent for me; hasn't even been near me! She always
used to rush in here and kiss me on the nose the very first- She's
ill—that’s it of course—sprained her fetlock or tomething. If she
was well. she’d have had me saddled as soon as she'd had her
morning feed, and we'd have gone for a canter together somewhere.
... . . I hope she’ll get well soon. I’m sick of being taken out b
the stableman; he’s so dull—no notion of conversation beyon
whistling! Now, Miss DIANA would talk to me the whole way. ... .
Fjºr hands and seat might have been— But what did that
matter? I liked to feel she was
on my back, I liked the sound of
her º: voice, and the touch of
her hand when she patted me
after her ride. . . . (He pricks
his ears.) Why, that’s her voice
outside now! She's all right,
after all. She's coming in to see
me! ... I knew she couldn't
have forgotten! -
Miss Diana's Voice (outside).
Yes, you might put it in here
for the present, STUBBs. I sup-
pose it will be quite safe.
Stubbs's Voice. Safe enough,
Miss, there 's plenty, o' ampty
stalls this side. Nothing in 'ere
just now, excep
Miss D.'s Voice. Wery well,
then. Just wipe some of the dust
off the mud-guards, use I
shall want it again after lunch.
And mind you don’t scratch the
enamel taking it in.
Stubbs. Very good, Miss. I'll -
be keerful.
[Miss DIANA’s steps die away
upon the cobbles.
Bayard (to himself). She's
gone-without even asking after
me! What has she been out in
—a bath chair? I’m sure she
must be ill.
Stubbs (to the bicycle, as he
wheels it in). 'Ere, steady now,
'old up, can’t ye? And don't go -
a-scratchin' my enamel with that
blarsted near o' yourn.
Blest if I wouldn't ruther rub
down arf a dozen 'unters nor one
o' these yere bloomin' bi-cycles.
I know where I am with a 'orse;
but these 'ere little, twisty,
spidery wheels—- Come orer, will ye.
till I’ve 'ad my dinner.
[He places the machine against a partition next to “Bayard's"
stall, and goes out.
JBayard (to himself, as he inspects his neighbour with the corner of
his eye). It's not a bath-chair; it's one of these bicycles. It must
be a sºft ºf animal. I suppose, or Stubbs wouldn't have spoken to it.
I should like to ask it one or two questions. (He gets his neck oper
the partition, and breathes gently through his nostrils upon the handle-
bars.) Excuse me, but do you understand horse-language at all?
The #evel. (qnswering by a succession of saddle-creaks). Per-
fectly. I'm a kind of horse myself, I believe, only immensely improred,
of course, Would you mind not ºf on my handle-bars like
that? it tarnishes the §. so. The saddle is §: seat of my in-
telligence, if you will kindly address your remarks there,
Bayard...I didn't know. I’m sorry. I will in future. I don't
creak myself, but I’ve been closely connected with saddles ever since
I was a two-year old, so I can follow you fairly well. Didn't Ihear
my mistress's voice outside just now?
The Bicycle. No; my mistress's, Miss DIANA's. I'd just taken
her out for a short spin-not far, only fifteen miles or so.
I'll lean ye up agen 'ere
Bayard. Again! You will have had a hard day of it altogether,
then. But I suppose you’ll get a day or two's rest afterwards? I
know I should want it.
The Bicycle. Bless you, I never want rest. Why, I've been
forty miles with her, and come home without clanking a link! She
was knocked up, if you like—couldn't go out for days!
Bayard. Ah, she was never knocked up after riding me !
The Bicycle. Because—it's no fault of yours, of course, but the
way you’ve been constructed—you couldn't go far enough to knock
anybody up. And she doesn’t get tired now, either. I’m not the
kind of bicycle to boast; but I’ve often heard her say that she much
refers her “bike” (she always calls me her “bike”—very nice and
riandly of her, isn't it?) to any mere horse.
Bayard. To any mere horse! And does she-give any reasons?
The Bicycle. Lots. For one thing, she says she feels so absolutely
safe on me; she knows that, whatever she meets, I shall never start,
or shy, or rear, or anything of that sort.
Bayard. I ãon't remember ever playing any of those tricks with
her, however hard she pulled the curb.
The Bicycle. Then she says she
º never has to consider whether any
º distance will be too much for me.
º Bayard. As for that— But
the ; I was out with her,
the better I was pleased; she
might have brought me home as
lame as a tree all round, and I
shouldn't have cared!
The Bicycle. Perhaps not.
But she would; so inconvenient,
you_see. Now my strong point
is, I can't go lame-in g
hands, of course, and she knows
exactly how to manage me, I will
say that for her!
Bayard. Does she give you
carrots or sugar after a ride?
she did me.
The Bicycle (with a creak of
IV. contempt). Now what do you sup-
|E pose I could do with sugar or a
Hº. carrot if I had it? No, a dro
#ſº or two of oil now and then is
I take in the way of sustenance.
That’s another point in my
favour, I cost little or nothing to
keep. Now, your oats and hay
and stuff, I daresay, cost more in
a year than I'm worth altogether!
Bayard. I must admit that
you have the advantage of me
In j. If I thought she
grudged memy oats— But I’m
afraid I couldn't manage on a
drop or two of oil.
The Bicycle. You’d want

THE OLD LOVE AND THE NEW.
“For 0, for 0, the hobby-horse is forgot!”
SCENE-The Stables at Saddlesprin
near Bykersall. Miss DIANA
in his Stall.
Bagard (talking to himself as is the habit of somehorses when alone).
I can't make it out. She's here. All the family came down yester-
day—I heard the omnibus start for the station to meet them. . And
yet she hasn't sent for me; hasn't even been near me! She always
used to rush in here and kiss me on the nose the very first- She’s
ill—that’s it of course—sprained her fetlock or tomething. If she
was well. she’d have had me saddled as soon as she’d had her
morning feed, and we’d have gone for a canter together somewhere.
... ... I hope she'll get well soon. I’m sick of being taken out b
the stableman; he’s so dull—no notion of conversation beyon
#. Now, Miss DIANA would talk to me the whole way. ... .
Perhaps her hands and seat might have been— But what did that
matter? I liked to feel she was
on my back, I liked the sound of
gº, the WHEELERs' Country House
s Horse, “Bayard,” discovered
Bayard. Again! You will have had a hard day of it altogether,
then. But I suppose you’ll get a day or two's rest afterwards? I
know I should want it.
The Bicycle, Bless you, I never want rest. Why, I've been
forty miles with her, and come home without clanking a link! She
was knocked up, if you like—couldn't go out for days!
Bayard. Ah, she was never knocked up after riding me !
The Bicycle. Because—it’s no fault of yours, of course, but the
way you’ve been constructed—you couldn't go far enough to knock
anybody up. And she doesn't get tired now, either. I’m not the
kind of bicycle to boast; but I’ve often heard her say that she much
refers her “bike” (she always calls me her “bike”—very nice and
riandly of her, isn't it?), to any mere horse.
Bayard. To any mere horse! And does she-give any reasons?
The Bicycle. Lots. For one thing, she says she feels so absolutely
safe on me; she knows that, whatever she meets, I shall never start,
or shy, or rear, or anything of that sort.
Bayard. I §on't remember ever playing any of those tricks with
her, however hard she pulled the curb.
The Bicycle. Then she says she
never has to consider whether any
her pretty voice, and the touch of º: º º distance will be too much for me.

Miss Diana's Voice (outside).
Yes, you might put it in here
for the present, STUBBs. I sup-
pose it will be quite safe.
Stubbs's Voice, Safe enough,
Miss, there 's plenty o' ampty
stalls this side. Nothing in 'ere
just now, excep
Miss D.'s Voice. Wery well,
then. Just wipe some of the dust
off the mud-guards, because I
shall want it again after lunch.
And mind you don’t scratch the
enamel taking it in.
Stubbs. Very good, Miss. I’ll
be keerful.
[Miss DIANA's steps die away
upon the cobbles.
Bayard (to himself). She 's
gone-without even asking after
me! What has she been out in
-a bath chair? I’m sure she
must be ill.
Stubbs (to the bicycle, as he
wheels it in). 'Ere, steady now,
'old up, can't ye? And don't go
a-scratchin' my enamel with that
blarsted near o' yourn.
Blest if I wouldn't ruthel rub
down arf a dozen 'unters nor one
ere bloomin' bi-ºycles.
ere I am with a 'orse;
- 'ere little, twisty,
spidery wheels- Come orer, will ye. I’ll lean ye up agen 'ere
till I’ve 'ad my dinner.
[He places the machine against a partition next to “Bayard's"
stall, and goes out.
Jayard (to himself.4s he inspects his neighbour with the corner of
his eye). It's not a bath-chair; it's one of these bicycles. It must
be a sort ºf animal, I suppose, or Stubbs wouldn't have spoken to it.
I,should like to ask it one or two questions. (He gets his neck oper
the partition, and breathes gently through his nostrils upon the handle-
bars.) Excuse me, but do you understand horse-language at all?
The Bicycle (answering by a succession of saddle-creaks). Per-
fectly. I'm a kind of horse myself, I believe, only immensely improred,
of course, Wºuld you mind not breathing on my handle-bars like
that? it tarnishes the §. so. The saddle is the seat of my in-
telligence, if you will kindly address your remarks there,
Bayard...I didn't know. I’m sorry. I will in future. I don't
greak myself, but I've been closely connected with saddles ever since
I was a two-year old, so I can follow you fairly well. Didn't Ihear
my mistress's voice outside just now?
The Bicycle. No; my mistress's, Miss DIANA's. I'd just taken
her out for a short spin-not far, only fifteen miles or so.
-

But she would; so inconvenient,
you_see. Now my strong point
is, can't go lame-in g

SPORTIVE SONGS.
AN OLD EToNIAN MUSES IN UPPER SoHool,
on THE FourTH of JUNE.
BENEATH the busts of Fox and PITT
In Upper School the youths declaim
The lines of statesman, poet, wit,
Who little recked of schoolboy fame.
None ever deemed his transient voice
Would live to kindle boyish fire.
But even Porson would reioice
To know that Greek could lads inspire I
The old dead languages revive,
E'en spoken with our “foreign twang,”
And French and German seem to thrive
Where GRAY and SHELLEY thought and
sang ;
Where WELLINGTON his battles won
Before his jacket turned to “tails,”
And GLADSTONE burned for many a son
The Eton light that never fails.
Where Rosebery and BALFour too
Authoritative rules would mock,
And earned, as stripling traitors do,
Meet expiation on the block.
Those panels scored with inwrought names
Are tribute to Etonians past,
Who, at “my tutor’s” or “my dame’s.”
Gave not a thought to names that last!
I hardly hear the speeches made,
Can scarce the “Head” or AINGER see.

y speech unheard is one for me!
I think how in this dear old school
I longed to test the unforeseen.
But now I know I was a foo
And only mourn what might have been 1

The sun entangled in your hair;

DEFINITION of THE START For THE DERby.
NECK OR NOTHING !
(By an Old Fogey, after a course of Fashion
Plates.)
OH, ladies! of loveliness little you reck!
Most fair is the feminine throttle;
But Fashion now packs up the daintiest neck
Till it looks like the neck of a bottle.
Destructive of shape, of sweet curve, of soft
Inape,
Are those *-all-aww let them
e
And *::: lover can doat on a fair female
throat,
Tied up at the back like a bundle?
La Mode does its worstwoman'sbeauty toblur,
To cramp, or distort, or enlarge her.
Now, a nice neck and head swathed in stiff
frills or fur
Look too much like St. John's “on a
charger.”
“A neck like a swan,” made for gazing upon,
Was a beauty in sweet Annie Laurie;.
But when modish pride would disfigure or hide
Woman's throat, everyman mustfeel sorry.
WHAT IT WILL COME TO,
ThE man in front of the bookstall was
uiescent, “But I assure you, Sir,” repeated
the attendant, “that this paper contains the
latest news and the best written articles. It
has correspondents in every part of the world,
and its information is at once unique an
reliable.”
“But how about the city intelligence and
the sporting P” -
“Prophets of the most wonderful sagacity
and success are in command, and have made
the fortunes of thousands of readers.”
“And, Literature, Music, Art, and the
Drama?”
“The very best critics give their finest work
to the consideration of the subjects to which
you refer.”
The man in front of the bookstall wavered.
“Is it a large paper?” he asked.
“A very large one,” was the reply, “but
in a most convenient shape. You see it con-
tains not only the news of the day, but all the
best features of a magazine, and a cyclopedia.”
“But, considering present prices in jour-
nalism, it is very expensive.”
“My dear sir,” said the attendant, “I see
it is best to be frank with you. I admit that
it is not cheap. But look at the quantity and
º !, Surely it is worth the money?”.
“Well, I suppose itis,” returned the man in
front of the bºtail, and without more ado
he paid the necessary-farthing.'
MANY HAPPY RETURNS,
To know the day—your birthday, dear-
Was my desire, that once a year
Something for certain I might know
fyou when far away.
But calm reflection tends to show
'Twas folly to have wanted so
To know the day!
Because all days, where’er I go,
You know—they say maids always know-
I think of you morn, noon, and night,
In moods both grave and gay.
Could I do more if some kind i.
Gave me the boon, the great delight,
To know the ãay ?
And yet to-day with phrases trite,
But still with all my heart, I write,
Snatching a moment from my work,
To wish you joy alway,
Because—the truth I will not shirk—
Because-I’ve found you out in Burke,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SPORTIVE SONGS.
AN OLD EToNIAN MUses IN UPPER SoHool,
on THE FourTH of JUNE.
BENEATH the busts of Fox and PITT
In Upper School the youths declaim
The lines of statesman, poet, wit,
Who little recked of schoolboy fame.
None ever deemed his transient voice
Would live to kindle boyish fire.
But even Porson would rejoice
To know that Greek could lads inspire l
The old dead languages revive,
E'en spoken with our “foreign twang,”
And French and German seem to thrive
Where GRAY and SHELLEY thought and
sang ;
Where WELLINGTON his battles won
Before his jacket turned to “tails,”
And GLADSTONE burned for many a son
The Eton light that never fails.
/*
|
-
Where Rosebehy and BALFOUR too
Authoritative rules would mock,
And earned, as stripling traitors do,
Meet expiation on the block.
Those panels scored with inwrought names
Are tribute to Etonians past,
Who, at “my tutor’s” or “my dame’s.”
Gave not a thought to names that last!
I hardly hear the speeches made,
Can scarce the “Head” or AINGER see.
My memory needs not their aid,
speech unheard is one for me!
I think how in this dear old school
I longed to test the unforeseen.
But now I know I was a fool
And only mourn what might have been 1
I see you sitting open-eyed-
The sun entangled in your hair;
You looked a dainty little bride,
So wondrous white, so º fair.
Precocious youngster! How I wished
Our lives we could together tune!

Then,
DEFINITION OF THE START FOR THE DERBY,
NECK OR NOTHING !
(By an Old Fogey, after a course of Fashion
Plates.)
OH, ladies! of loveliness little you reck!
Most fair is the feminine throttle;
But Fashion now packs up the daintiest neck|i
Till it looks like the neck of a bottle.
Destructive of shape, of sweet curve, of soft
Inape,
Are those wheel-frills— away let them
trundle
And what lover can doat on a fair female
throat,
Tied up at the back like a bundle?
La Mode does its worstwoman'sbeauty toblur,
To cramp, or distort, or enlarge her.
Now, a nice neck and head swathed in stiff
frills or fur
Look too much like St. John's “on a
charger.”
“A neck like a swan,” made for gazing upon,
Was a beauty in sweet Annie Laurie;
But when modish pride would disfigure or hide
Woman's throat, everyman mustfeel sorry.
WHAT IT WILL COME TO.
ThE man in front of the bookstall was
niescent, “But I assure you, Sir,” repeated
the attendant, “that this paper contains the
latest news and the best written articles. It
has correspondents in every part of the world,
and its information is at once unique and
reliable.”
“But, how about the city intelligence and
the sporting P” -
“Prophets of the most wonderful sagacity
and success are in command, and have made
the fortunes of thousands of readers.”
“And, Literature, Music, Art, and the
Drama?”
“The #. best critics give their finest work
to the consideration of the subjects to which
you refer.”
The man in front of the bookstall wavered.
“Is it a large paper?” he asked.
“A very large one,” was the reply, “but
in a most convenient shape. You see it con-
tains not only the news of the day, but all the
best features of a magazine, and acyclopedia.”
... But considering present prices in jour-
nalism, it is very expensive.”
“My dear sir,” said the attendant, “I see
it is best to be frank with you. I admit that
it is not cheap. But look at the *...? and
quality!, Surely it is worth the money?”.
“Well, I suppose itis,” returned the manin
front of the book-stall, and without more ado
he paid the necessary-farthing.'
MANY. HAPPY RETURNS.
To know the day—your birthday, dear-
Was my desire, that once a year
Something for certain I might know
Of you when far away.
But calm reflection tends to show
'Twas folly to have wanted so
To know the day!
Because all days, where’er I go,
You know—they say maids always know–
I think of you morn, noon, and night,
In moods both grave and gay.
Could I do more if some kind #.
Gave me the boon, the great delight,
To know the ãay ?
And yet to-day with phrases trite,
But still with all my heart, I write,
Snatching a moment from my work,
To wish you joy alway,
Because—the truth I will not shirk—
Because-I’ve found you out in Burke,

somebody whose name isn't mentioned in the

“I have often heard of it,” returned the Arab. “And it is so
much better arranged nowadays than in

“Because, my dear fellow,” replied
his friend, “the ines require

OUR 8PEGIALLY REGOMMENDED SELECTION FOR THE DERBY.
(By a New Hand.)
I AM glad, Sir, you decided to move with the times, and deputed
me to give you and your numberless readers a real genuine put-
your-last-dollar-cm-it prophecy on the event of the sportive year.
And having placed this confidence in my knowing-it-all-beforehand
#. I would not think of deceiving you. No, Sir, I would not
escend to talking like some of the ignorant tipsters of the so-called
racing papers, of “Qld Solis,” or “Ju Plu,” or “”Appy o'Polly who
drives the Fee'Bus.” If I had to ascend to classical particulars, I
would remind you that the circus of the ancients was composed of
the “cavea,” the “spina,” and some cypress trees, ...?"by the
good old sportsmen of those distant days the “matae,” or goals. I
would suggest that “ava” or eggs were P: up or down as each
charioteer completed a “lap,” in honour of those genuine contest-
loving Johnnies dear old Castor and good old Pollux. I could write
E. more, in this line, if you could not get for yourself the whole
g of tricks-as I did—at first hand frºm irº's nº snai.
Dictionary of Antiquities.
So leaving the classics—the pure gold ºf my book-shelves, and the
spurious imitation of the ignorant tipsters of the so-called racing
papers-Icome to modern times. You want to know who is to win the
event which has been very properly called “The Blue Riband of the
Turf.” And in these days of Stock Exchange surprises, of South
African slumps, and cycle booms, when you scarcely know where you
are or what you are doing, it is refreshing to get away from the
heated atmosphere of Capel Court to inhale the hawthorn-scented
breezes of Epsom Downs. And if you should be able to make a few
pounds before “going home to tea,” like the faithful mariner whose
“heart was true to Poll,” why shouldn't you? In these precious
hard times, when you have to pay five-and-sixpence in the pound as
rates, and the same old “eightpence” for income-tax, why, I repeat,
". shouldn't you?
I contend he who can pick out the absolute winner before it’s
printed on world-renowned “Correct Card” is a public benefactor.
And, beforehand, let it be known I don't want a statue. No, not even
if it could be done as old HoRACE hathit, “as easily as the nimble nine
dupondit,” by saying that the effigy alleged to be the late JoHN
BRIGHT, in the Lobby of the House of Commons was in realit
intended for me. No, Sir, and ladies and gentleman all, don't insult
me with statues, but send to me--as a mark of respect and personal
goodwill-a, small percentage of your winnings. However small a
sum it is I shall be pleased, as it will be a token to me that I have
given pleasure to others.
And now comes the momentous question—who is to win? I can
tell you, and I am not going to beat about the bush, as some of the
ignorant tipsters of the so-called racing papers do by saying in one
line what ihey unsay in the next. hat is the use of becoming
invidious by *::::::::: ?. When all the horses are good, why
pick out the flower of the flock? If I did, I would be sure to hurt
someone's feelings. It may be a certainty for the Prince, or the
three, as they are all and every one of them fine specimens of the
best traditions of the British Turf. And mind you *...*. it’s
not all “rara apis in terris,” which, by the way, must not be con-
founded with the talented gentleman who appears nightly at the
Adelphi in One of the Best.
And having now said enough to show my preference, my fancy, I
ick out the winner... I give you “one, two, three,” so that if you
on't secure the absolute first, you can at any rate come safe home
with a place. Without further circumlocution or additional procras-
tination, I plump for-

OPERATIC NOTES.
Whit Monday.—The two DE REszkfs, with all their wits about
them, appear, John as Faust, and Edward as Mephistopheles. The
latter, refraining from indulgence in .
that sort of humour which formerly
made his Mephisto a “devilish amusing
fellow, dontcherknow,” is now more sa-
turnine and satirical. Prefer his first
reading, as more in character with the
mocking fiend who wishes his victim to
have a short life, but a merry one.
Mephisto enters into the game as “the
joker.” He used to cower and snarl only
when interfered with by objectionable
persons with cross-handled swords; other-
wise he was a jovial, cynical companion,
full of impish practical jokes. , MAGGIE
MAC-INTIRELY good as Marguerite; fresh
as a daisy, and sad as a lack-a-daisical
prima donna should be when she has come
to grief. Opera in French, That accom-
lished M.A., or Mistress of Arts, Madame
AUERMEISTER, good as ever, if not better
than ever, in character of gay young .#
Martha, Holiday House crowded,thoug
many stall-warts away, taking their
Whitsun holiday. MANCINELLI conduct-
ing himself admirably. Orchestra out of
sight, but not out of mind, nor out of time or tune. Never better.
Chorus, perhaps, a trifle Whitmondayish.
- Tuesday.-Fra Diavolo, as before, BE-
VIGNANI in the chair.
Wednesday and Thursday.—Warbling
WAGNER nights, with EMMA EAMEs, PLAN-
CoN, and ANCONA, in Tannhäuser, and
LES DE REHzkſ, FBiêREs, with Madame
ALBAN1, in Lohengrin. Tannhäuser excel-
lentissimo. The Brothers at their best, as
are EMMA EAMEs and the others.
Friday.—Pagliacci and Cavalleria Rus-
ticana, always a charming couple, with a
new Santuzza, Mlle. D'ALMA; but we are
waiting to see the second opera made into
Calvé–leria, which will give it a fresh

Saturday —Meistersinger to commence
at 7.30. hen shall we dine? And if it is
not over till past midnight, where shall we supf. Thºse difficulties
surmounted, we go to to-night's performance of Die Meistersinger.
House crowded. Extra seats wherever they could be placed.
Brothers JEAN and Edouahn de Rºszkº warbling WAGNER in the
choicest Italian, Imagoificently, with PLANÇon dºing. his level best,
and DAvid BISPHAM with M. BonnARD, an Englishman and a
Frenchman, thoroughly entering into the Wagnerian fun of German
low comedy. EMMA EAMEs as Eva and Madame BAUERMEISTER as
Maddalena leaving nothing to be desired, except that Waggish
WAGNER should have given them more to do. Enthusiastic calls
for everybody after every Act; and Merry MANCINEI.I.I dragged on
by the Great Twin Brethren to take his well-earned share of the
general congratulations. Splendid finish to second week's Opera.

ROUNDABOUT READINGS,
My BROTHER-IN-LAw.
(Continued.)
HERE then was HARRY once more on my hands. Though he was
still a very young man, he had contrived to gram a great deal of life
into a very short space of time. He had been at Cambridge, had
made an army-tutor's too hot to hold him, had revelled from wealth
to .# at Monte Carlo, had totally failed in business, and had
apparently exhausted the resources of British Columbia...The situa-
tion was a serious one, for we were confronted with the pressing
necessity of doing something for HARRY... You can't put a brother:
in-law away in a drawer of your writing-table, lock him up, and
forget all about him, as if he were a bill, and you can't tear him up
and throw him into a waste-paper basket, as if he were an appeal for
a church building-fund; but apart from such drastic proceedings in
the direction of total neglect and oblivion, it was difficult to see how
we were to treat this returned prodigal.
HARRY, I am bound, to say, was quite amiable, and showed a
rfect readiness to fall in with any proposal made for his benefit.
ere was a fine carelessness about him that disarmed anger. “You
settle it yourself, old man,” he said, “I’ll chip in when you tell me
the band’s ready to start playing.”
“But you won't like the tune, you know,” I observed.
“Lord bless you, I shall like any tune, and, look here,” he con:
tinued, with a generous show of making a great concession, “I’ll
play any blessed instrument you like, big drum, bones, or concertina
—it’s all one to me. Just you settle it, and then give me the office,
that's all I want.”. Thereupon he helped himself to one of my long
cigars, rang the bell, and told my butler to bring him a whiskey and
soda. All this talking, he said, made his throat as dry as a limekiln.
“BUT couldn't you suggest something yourself?” I asked
“Surely you must have some preference.” He pondered for a few
moments, and sipped his drink. “I’ll tell you what, old man,” he
suddenly broke out, “I’ve got it. I’ll go to the Bar. I can eat
dinners with the best of 'em, and as for going into chambers, why, I
could do it on my head, wig and all. You can take me into partner-
ship, old man, or I'll devil for you. I don't know what a chap does
when he devils, but it sounds the sort of thing that might suit me.
S2, there you are, and don't you ever, say I refused to help in pro-
viding myself with a profession. I’ll go to the Bar and keep on
devilling all day; and Ishan't want a big screw to begin with. Five
or six hundred a year will do me. Is it a whack?”. I had to explain
to him that it was not a whack, a decision which did not impair his
cheerfulness in the very least.
WHEN I consulted ALIGE, she said that the poor boy must not be
hurried into anything. There was lots of time, and, thank Heaven,
we had money enough to º him in the meanwhile. As a prac-
tical prºposal, she suggested that I ought to find a pleasant open air
occupation for him, something that would keep him amused without
putting, too great a tax upon his intellectual faculties. , Why
shouldn't I send him down to look after the shooting I had taken in
Suffolk? HARRY could live in the house ºr. the keepers
and make preparations for the season; and as foomi only get down
there occasionally, the arrangement would really be advantageous
to me. So said, so done. This conversation took place in the begin-
; of August, and in the following week HARRY started for Suffolk
with one of the handsomest shooting and game-keeping outfits I
have ever seen.
I HAVE no wish to linger long over the recollection of this experi-
ment. It is tº to say that I got very little shooting myself.
Somehow or other HARRY always wrote, at a time most inconvenient
for me, to say that the birds really must be killed at once, and that,
if I couldn't come myself, he thought he could get two or three
fellows who could hold pretty straight, and, with their help, he
might manage. He did manage. He and his friends had what he
Galled a slap-up time, and lived—at my expense-on, the fat of the
land. ALICE certainly pointed out that it was delightful to have so
many partridges and pheasants to give away to our friends, and that
she always knew HARRY had a good heart, and would come right in
the end. But, when I had paid all the bills, and counted the cost,
I concluded that a shooting, managed in this style, was too expensive
a luxury for me, especially as my own friends did not seem to fit in
with HARRY's ideas. “Those two old Q. C. johnnies,” he remarked,
‘‘can’t shoot for nuts; and as for the Judge, he seemed to think
I was a pheasant or a rabbit, by the way he tried to pepper me. No,
thanks; I'll let the coroner get along without me, if I can.” On the
whole, the experiment was not a success, and I determined not to
repeat it. So there was HARRY on my hands again.
SINCE then we have tried a great many other plans. We took a
little cottage on the Thames, and installed Yin it. His bill for
steam-launches was colossal. We packed him off with a couple of
friends for a voyage on the Norfolk Broads; we took rooms for him
in a moderate hunting county, but he soon tired of that, and said
Leicestershire was the only county for a man who respected himself.
So, though the inference was not obvious, to Leicestershire he went,
with two horses of mine, and two that he bought for himself, dirt
cheap, as he told me. As to the dirt I know nothing; the cheapness
I deny, especially as I had to pay for them. At present, we have
quartered him out in a golfing centre, with a brand new set of clubs,
and a first-class bicycle. In fact, HARRY is sampling every amuse-
ment and almost every expensive pursuit under the sun, and all at
my cost. This cannot go on much longer; no income can stand it;
But I am as far as ever from knowing what to do with my cheerful
brother-in-law,

that sort of humour which formerly
made his Mephisto a “devilish amusing
fellow, dontcherknow,” is now more sa-
turnine and satirical. Prefer his first
reading, as more in character with the
mocking fiend who wishes his victim to
have a short life, but a merry one.
Mephisto enters into the game as “the
joker.” He used to cower and snarl only
when interfered with by objectionable
persons with cross-handled swords; other-
wise he was a jovial, cynical companion,
full of impish practical jokes. , MAggrº.

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
My BROTHER-IN-LAw.
(Continued.)
HERE then was HARRY once more on my hands. Though he was
still a very young man, he had contrived to gram a great deal of life
into a very short space of time. He had been at Cambridge, had
made an army-tutor's too hot to hold him, had revelled from wealth
to penury at Monte Carlo, had totally failed in business, and had
apparently exhausted the resources of British Columbia...The situa-
tion was a serious one, for we were confronted with the H.;
necessity of doing something for HARRY... You can't put a brother:
in-law away in a drawer of your writing-table, lock him up, and
forget all about him, as if he were a bill, and you can't tear him up
and throw him into a waste-paper basket, as if he were an appeal for
a church building-fund; but apart from such drastic proceedings in
the direction of total neglect and oblivion, it was difficult to see how
we were to treat this returned prodigal.
HARRY, I am bound to say, was quite amiable, and showed a
ect readiness to fall in with any proposal made for his benefit.
ere was a fine carelessness about him that disarmed anger. “You
settle it yourself, old man,” he said, “I’ll chip in when you tell me
the band’s ready to start playing.”
“But you won't like the tune, you know,” I observed.
“Lord bless you, I shall like any tune, and, look here,” he con:
tinued, with a generous show of making a great concession, “I’ll
play any blessed instrument you like, big , bones, or concertina
—it’s all one to me. Just you settle it, and then give me the office,
that's all I want.”. Thereupon he helped himself to one of my long
cigars, rang the bell, and told my butler to bring him a whiskey and
soda. All this talking, he said, made his throat as dry as a limekiln.
“BUT couldn't you suggest something yourself?” I asked
“Surely you must have some preference.” He pondered for a few
moments, and sipped his drink. “I’ll tell you what, old man,” he
suddenly broke out, “I’ve got it...I’ll go to the Bar. I can eat
dinners with the best of 'em, and as for going into chambers, why, I
could do it on my head, wig and all. You can take me into partner-
ship, Qld man, or I'll devil for you. I don't know what a chap does
when he devils, but it sounds the sort of thing that might suit me.
S2, there you are, and don't you ever, say I refused to help in pro-
viding myself with a profession. I’ll go to the Bar and keep on
devilling all day; and Ishan't want a big screw to begin with. Five
or six hundred a year will do me. Is it a whack?”. I had to explain
to him that it was not a whack, a decision which did not impair his
cheerfulness in the very least.
WHEN I consulted ALICE, she said that the poor boy must not be
hurried into ...; There was lots of time, and, thank Heaven,
we had money enough to support him in the meanwhile. As a prae-
tical proposal, she suggested that I ought to find a pleasant open air
occupation for him, something that would keep him amused without
putting, too great a tax upon his intellectual faculties. Why
shouldn't I send him down to look after the shooting I had taken in
Suffolk P HARRY could live in the house ºr. the keepers
and make preparations for the season; and as foomi only get down
there occasionally, the arrangement would really be advantageous
to me. So said, so done. This conversation took place in the begin-
j of August, and in the following week HARRY started for Suffolk
with one of the handsomest shooting and game-keeping outfits I
have ever seen.
I HAVE no wish to linger long over the recollection of this experi-
ment. It is enough to say that I got very little shooting myself.
Somehow or other HARRY always wrote, at a time most inconvenient
for me, to say that the birds really must be killed at once, and that,
if I couldn't come myself, he thought he could get two or three
fellows who could hold pretty straight, and, with their help, he
might manage. He did manage. He and his friends had what he
ed a slap-up time, and lived—at my expense-on, the fat of the
land. ALICE certainly pointed out that it was delightful to have so
many partridges and pheasants to give away to our friends, and that
she always knew HARRY had a good heart, and would come right in
the end. But, when I had paid all the bills, and counted the cost,
I concluded that a shooting, managed in this style, was too expensive
a luxury for me, especially as my own friends did not seem to fit in
with HARRY's ideas. “Those two old Q. C. johnnies,” he remarked,
‘‘can’t shoot for nuts; and as for the Judge, he seemed to think
I was a pheasant or a rabbit, by the way he tried to pepper me. No,
thanks; I'll let the coroner get along without me, if I can.” On the
whole, the experiment was not a success, and I determined not to
repeat it. So there was HARRY on my hands again.
SINCE then we have tried a great many other plans. We took a
little cottage on the Thames, and installed Yin it. His bill for
steam-launches was colossal. We packed him off with a couple of
friends for a voyage on the Norfolk Broads; we took rooms for him
in a moderate hunting county, but he soon tired of that, and said
Leicestershire was the only county for a man who respected himself.
So, though the inference was not obvious, to Leicestershire he went,
with two horses of mine, and two that he bought for himself, dirt
cheap, as he told me. As to the dirt I know nothing; the cheapness
I deny, especially as I had to pay for them. At present, we have
quartered him out in a *::: centre, with a brand new set of clubs,
and a first-class bicycle. In fact, HARRY is sampling every amuse-
ment and almost every expensive pursuit under the sun, and all at
my cost. This cannot go on much longer; no income can stand it;
But I am as far as ever from knowing what to do with my cheerful
brother-in-law.

MEDIAEWAL ITALLAN DOG MUZZLE.
(From a Mural Tablet.)
OUR 8PEGIALLY REGOMMENDED SELECTION FOR THE DERBY.
(By a New Hand.)
I AM glad, Sir, you decided to move with the times, and deputed
me to give you and your numberless readers a real genuine put-
your-last-dollar-cn-it, prophecy on the eyent of the sportive year,
And having placed this confidence in my knowing-it-all-beforehand
#. I would not think of deceiving you. No, Sir, I would not
escend to talking like some of the ignorant tipsters of the so-called
racing papers, of “Old Solis,” or “Ju Plu,” or “”Appy o'Polly who
drives the Fee’Bus.” If I had to ascend to classical particulars, I
would remind º that the circus of the ancients was composed of
the “cavea,” the “spina,” and some cypress trees, called by the
good old sportsmen of those distant days the “matae,” or goals. I
would suggest that, “ara” or eggs were P: up or down as each
charioteer completed a “lap,” in honour of those genuine contest-
loving Johnnies dear old Qastor and good old Pollux. I could write
* more in this line, if you could not get for yourself the whole
g of tricks—as I did—at first hand frºm ix. Sºmaliº:
Dictionary of Antiquities.
So leaving the classics—the pure gold of my book-shelves, and the
spurious imitation of the ignorant tipsters of the so-called racing
papers—I come to modern times. You want to know who is to win the
event which has been very properly called “The Blue Riband of the
Turf.” And in these days of Stock Exchange surprises, of South
African slumps, and cycle booms, when you scarcely know where you
are or what you are doing, it is refreshing to get away from the
heated atmosphere of Capel Court to inhale the hawthorn-scented
breezes of Epsom Downs. And if you should be able to make a few
pounds before “going home to tea,” like the faithful mariner whose
“heart was true to Poll,” why shouldn't you? In these precious
hard times, when you have to pay five-and-sixpence in the pound as
rates, and the same old “eightpence” for income-tax, why, I repeat,
". shouldn't you?
I contend he who can pick out the absolute winner before it’s
printed on world-reno “Correct Card” is a public benefactor.
And, beforehand, let it be known I don't want a statue. No, not even
if it could be done as old HoRACE hathit, “as easily as the nimble nine
dupondii,” º saying that the effigy alleged to be the late John
BRIGHT, in the Lobby, of the House of Commons was in realit
intended for me. No, Sir, and ladies and gentleman all, don't insult
me with statues, but send to me--as a mark of respect and personal
goodwill—-a small percentage of your winnings. However small a
sum it is I shall be pleased, as it will be a token to me that I have
given pleasure to others.
And now comes the momentous question—who is to win? I can
tell you, and I am not going to beat about the bush, as some of the
ignorant tipsters of the so-called racing papers do by saying in one
line what they unsay in the next, hat is the use of becoming
invidious by *:::::::g?. When all the horses are good, why
pick out the flower of the flock? If I did, I would be sure to hurt
someone's feelings. It may be a certainty for the Prince, or the
three, as they are all and º one of them fine specimens of the
best traditions of the British Turf. And mind you nowadays it's
not all “rara apis in terris,” which, by the way, must not be con-
founded with the talented gentleman who appears nightly at the
Adelphi in One of the Best.
...And having now said enough to show my preference, my fancy, I
ick out the winner... I give you “one, two, three,” so that if you
on't secure the absolute first, you can at any rate come safe home
with a place. Without further circumlocution or additional procras-
tination, I plump for—

and have no hesitation as to the result. And now, please, print my
name-sounding the second “i” short for special identification.

“Please stand aside,” added the statesman.
“We will discuss the matter further when
occasion permits. Remember that this is a
critical moment. Recollect that I am the
principal political officer.”
“And I the commander-in-chief.”
“Can't help that, gentlemen,” responded
the Government messenger; "but, as you
have both reached to-day the age limit, you
are compulsorily retired.’
So the warrior and the statesman gave up
the campaign at the critical moment. When
they got home, they both received a pension:
But, although the award was well earned, it
was neither a pleasure to the recipients nor an
advantage to the bestowers.
Still it was a triumph for red tape, and
that—as every one knows—is something.

You must be very like a whale.

No. XIV.
Mr. Jabberjee's fellow-student. What’s in a Title? An invitation
to a Wedding. Mr. J. as a wedding guest, with what he thought
of the ceremony, and how he distinguished himself on the
occasion,
THERE is a certain English young fellow-student of mine-
videlicet, Howard ALLBUTT-INNETT, Esquire, with whom I have
succeeded in scratching an acquaintance at sundry Law, Lectures,
and in the Library of my Inn of Court—a most amiable º
oung chap, who is “ the moulded glass of fashionable form,” an
#. cap-in-hand with innumerable aristocratic nobs. ...
Seeing that I had (at an earlier-period) been a more diligent atten-
dant and note-taker of lectures
than himself, he did pay me the
transcendent compliment of bor-
rowing the loan of my note-book,
which, to my gra astonish-
ment, he condescended to bring
back personally to Porticobello
House, saying that he had found
my notes magnificent, and totally
incomprehensible to his more
limited intellect!
In additum, he graciously ac-
cepted my invitation to ascend
to the drawing-room, where I º
introduced him freely to several %
select lady boarders as my alter
ego and Fidus Achates.
On taking his leave, he ex-
pressed some marvelling that I
should have concealed my superior \%
rank under the reticence of a $º
napkin, having observed that I
was addressed a "Prince.” by
more than one of the softer-sexed
boarders.
I replied that I attached no
valid importance to the nominis
umbra of such a barren title, and
that the contents of what there
is nothing in must necessarily be
naught.
He answered me warmly, that
he entirely joined issue with me
in such an opinion, and that he -
was often affected to sickishness
by the snobbery of mundane
society, adding that he hoped I
would give him the look up at
his paternal mansion in Prince's
Square, Bayswater, shortly, since
his people would be overjoyed at
making my acquaintance, which
both enraptured and surprised
me, for hitherto he had ridden
the high and rough-shoed horse,
and employed me to suck my
brains as a cat's foot.

forward, and addressing, a lady whom I took to be the bride, I
felicitated her loudly, wis that she might never become a widow,
or use vermilion on her grey head, and that she might wear the iron
bangle, and get seven male children.
Unhappily the serene ray of my goodwill was born to blush unseen
in the dark unfathomed cave of a desert ear, for the actual recipient
of my compliments was an unmarried spinster relative, who had
already passed the years of discretion.

On my arrival, I held a lengthy colloquy with the hºp; bride-

the evening in having his ears pulled, and otherfacetious banterings,
- by his mother-in-law and sisters-
in-law, as in India.
* But he seemed oppressed by so
severe a bashfulness that I could
extract no information from him,
and presently the father of the
bride came up and conducted me
into an apartment wherein was a
kind of bazaar, or exhibition of
clocks and lamps and stationery
cases and knives and forks and
other trinkets , and gewgaws,
none of which appeared to me at
all different from similar objects
in shop windows.
However, the greatest admira-
, tion and wonderment were ex-
pressed by all who entered, and I
found that the host was under
grave apprehensiveness that the
presents might be looted by the
more unscrupulous of the guests,
for he pointed out to me a sharp-
eyed, shy gentleman in a corner,
who, he informed me, was a dis-
gui police-officer. This, at
first, I was loth to believe, but
was assured that it was a neces-
sary precaution.
Still, I will presume to point
out that the simulation by a
policeman of the ordinary cha-
racter of a friend of the family
is and fellow-rejoicer, is a rather
reprehensible trap to catch a
sleeping weasel, since those whose
honesty is not invariably above

security by his civilian get-up.
And I did assure him, privately,
that it was totally unnecessary to
keep an eye on myself, who was
a native University man with no

nini, who, in the last act. might have
substituted “Patty / Patty /* for
“Martha / Martha 7” to the well-

somewhere about the time of Robin Hood, to j º by the costume,
was, it appears, overlooked by an Alpine range, including a suspicion
of snow-capped mountains. The Surrey hills, always a fair scene, must

A LITTLE MOSCOW-RAID.
[By a party of 170 revellers, led by an active chap-Perowne, who have
visited Russia to witness the Coronation.]
To Moscow we've been, and the show we have seen,
And now we’re returning to Britain,
Our tales to recount, despite the amount
Of stuff that’s already been written.
We English all found, as we trotted around,
That the Russians were mightily civil;
The croakers' alarms at the troubles and harms, .
We should meet with might well be called “drivel.”
If we photo'd or sketched, 'twas said we'd be fetched
By gendarmes and removed to Siberia;
While scribbling was banned by the law of the land–
All these warnings were simple hysterial
Like Britishers bold, in each palace we strolled,
With our visiting cards as mere permit;
The police let us through, without further ado,
Surprised by our “cheek,” as I’ll term it.
We kodaked the Czar and his i. bizarre,
And felt not a qualm nor a trembling;
Quite free of all charge, we wandered at large
O'er the place I must spell as the “Krembling.”
We came and we saw and were conquered—no flaw
Could we find in the pageant of wonders;
If we think we could beat this spectacular treat,
We make just the biggest of blunders!
If only they’d spend a few roubles, and mend
Those pavements that shake you to pieces,
To Moscow we'd burn straightway to return-
'Tis a town where delight never ceases!
And if ever the Russ should abolish the fuss
About passports, as done by BRITANNIA,
Why then, when we part, we could say from our heart
The Slav au revoir—“do svidanya.”
“Not YsAYELY BUT Too WELL.”—I say that YsAYR's last concert
takes place on Saturday next. Ysaye-turday? Why not saysome other
day, when it wouldn't clash (which is inharmonious) with the Sara-
sate Concert? If YsAYE were a Ysaye-acre, he would have made
some other arrangement. Ysaye this now?'. Never too late. Will
YsAYE oblige, and play BACH's famous Chaconne in D. minor?
Forwards! always, but “try BACH,” is the modern musician's motto.
Perhaps some amateurs there be who do not care for the Chaconne.
They should be “well Chaconne before taken” to hear the perform-
ance. But, after all, “Chaconne d son goiſt.” And at this we leave it.

A LITTLE MOSCOW-RAID,
[By a party of 170 revellers, led by an active chap-Perowne, who have
visited Russia to witness the Coronation.]
To Moscow we've been, and the show we have seen,
And now we’re returning to Britain,
Our tales to recount, despite the amount
Of stuff that’s already been written.
We English all found, as we trotted around,
That the Russians were mightily civil;
The croakers' alarms at the troubles and harms, .
We should meet with might well be called “drivel.”
If we photo'd or sketched, 'twas said we’d be fetched
By gendarmes and removed to Siberia;
While scribbling was banned by the law of the land-
All these warnings were simple hysteria!
Like Britishers bold, in each palace we strolled,
With our visiting cards as mere permit;
The police let us through, without further ado,
Surprised by our “cheek,” as I’ll term it.
We kodaked the Czar and his entry bizarre,
And felt not a qualm nor a trembling;
Quite free of all charge, we wandered at large
O'er the place I must spell as the “Krembling.”
We came and we saw and were conquered—no flaw
Could we find in the pageant of wonders;
If we think we could beat this spectacular treat,
We make just the biggest of blunders!
If only they’d spend a few roubles, and mend
Those pavements that shake you to pieces,
To Moscow we'd burn straightway to return-
'Tis a town where delight never ceases!
And if ever the Russ should abolish the fuss
About passports, as done by BRITANNIA,
Why then, when we part, we could say from our heart
The Slav au revoir—“do svidanya.'”
“Not YsAYELY BUT Too WELL.”—I say that YsAYR's last concert
takes place on Saturdaynext. Ysaye-turday? Why not saysomeother
day, when it wouldn't clash (which is inharmonious) with the Sara-
sate Concert? If YsAYE were a Ysaye-acre, he would have made
some other arrangement. Ysaye this now?'. Never too late. Will
YsAYE oblige, and play BACH's famous Chaconne in D minor?
Forwards! always, but “try BACH,” is the modern musician's motto.
Perhaps some amateurs there be who do not care for the Chaconne.
They should be “well Chaconne before taken” to hear the perform-
ance. But, after all, “Chaconne dº son goilt.” And at this we leave it.
FROM ARMENIA To CoRNwall.—The SULTAN's confidential emis:
tary, the Ritter MICHEL von NEwl.INsky—or, as he is a distinguished
Austrian journalist, let us call him “the Writer MichEL”—when he
has settled the diplomatic difficulty, will take advantage of his name,
which proclaims his Cornish, origin (he was born under a ‘Newlyn
sky”), to proceed to Cornwall and settle the Newlyn strikers -
:ſº The artists there will welcome him at the Newlyn School.
CREAMERY AND CASH.-See the profits from ice-cream, lemonade,
water ices, &c. P. About 500 per cent, according to case in Sheriff's
Court. Why not a boom in ginger-beer? De Ginger-Beers much
better than De Beers.

THE CHAPERON'S WADE
MECUM.
Question. Now that the London
season is at its height, I suppose
it may be assumed that you are
becoming weary P
Answer. Not so much as might
reasonably be expected, as habit
is second nature, and the duties
of a chaperon are practically con-
tinuous.
. Q. But do you not obtain rest
in the country?
Not when one's charge has
been out for more than a year,
and has no time to lose.
Q. Has it not been suggested
that chaperons are superfluous P
A. The idea was imported from
America, but was discarded when
the New Woman was voted out
of date.
Q. Then a débutante still re-
quires a guide?
A. Certainly; who should also
be a philosopher and a friend.
Q. What are the duties of a
chaperon to her charge P
A. To attend her to garden-
to suggest a vague superinten-
dence over her movements.
Q. May a chaperon indulge in

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
CHARIWARI.
THE CHAPERON'S WADE
MECUM.
Question. Now that the London
season is at its height, I suppose
it may be assumed that you are
becoming weary P
Answer. Not so much as might
reasonably be expected, as habit
is second nature, and the duties
of a chaperon are practically con-
tinuous.
. Q. But do you not obtain rest
in the country?
. Not when one's charge has
been out for more than a year,
and has no time to lose.
Q. Has it not been suggested
that chaperons are superfluous?
A. The idea was imported from
America, but was discarded when
the New Woman was voted out
of date.
Q. Then, a débutante still re-
quires a guide?
A. Certainly; who should also
be a philosopher and a friend.
Q. What are the duties of a
chaperon to her charge P
A. To attend her to garden-
party, concert, opera, or ball, and
to suggest a vague jºintent
dence over her movements.
Q. May a chaperon indulge in
any of the pleasures of her
charge?
A. Until recently, she might
dance at balls, but the mode is
now considered antiquated.
Q. Is it permitted to her w
s!eep on duty P
A. The correct answer to this
question depends on circum-
stances. If an eligible parti is
present repose, is sometimes not
only permissible, but beneficial;
but a chaperon can never be
sufficiently wideawake in the
neighbourhood of a detrimental.
Q. Is not the wear and tear of
a nightly tour of revelry trying
to health and strength?
A. Yes; and consequently Sun-
day entertainmentsareto be depre-
cated, as an addition to a burthen
alieady sufficiently irksome.

DILKE, and SAGE OF QUEEN ANNE's GATE chimed in. These
easily put on one side. At least they haven't got the Green
Book, and speak only by hearsay. The CAP'RN literally
speaks by the book. No more shaking him off than was
found possible by the wedding guest in the case of another
Ancient Mariner.
The Under Secretary could not choose but hear. Some
choice left him in matter of answering questions. Elected
to make none, or hardly any. Scene losed with vague
impression, that there is something, wrong at the Foreign
Office; that the X rays of Cap'en ToMMY's remaining eye
have pierced the veil; that the MARKISs has been thrown
into a state of extreme nervous unrest; and that even
GeoRGE CURzoN's imperturbability has been punctured as if
it were merely a pneumatic tyre.
“I wonder at you, of all men, CAP'EN,” said SARK.
“You have your little flare-ups from time to time; but

once staying down at Middle Hall, in Worcestershire, with
old friend THOMAS PHILLIPPs, Going through his library,
he showed me precious fifteenth-century manuscript, being
the Itinerarium of AMBROSIUS CAMALDULENSIS. The manu-
script is, in the main, written in-Latin. But, as Sir THoMA's

monks came to record the peccadilloes of monks or nuns of his own

this story? and don't you think it is applicable to conduct of a
good Ministerialist?”

Thursday.-Who was it of whom the poet remarked that he was
Problematically pious, but indubitably drunk?
No one in the House of Commons, I’m sure, whether big or little,
having gathedral connections, or chumming in chapel. Line recurs
to SARK's inconsequential mind as he yawns through the slow hours,
and from time to time awakes to the conclusion that the House is
problematically busy, but indubitably dull. Light Railways on
again., Started very well with RITCHIE in guard's yan. At first
seemed as if it would reach terminus “on time,” as they say in the
United States. At junction with Clause 13 line blocked; for
more than hour train didn't advance a yard. Steam-whistle blown
for Closure; no notice taken by signalman in box at table. Another
long wait; steam-whistle on again; this time signal answered;
points closed; train moved on-to be blocked again, and so laid up
for the night, with destination still far off.
“Talk about your Big Wheel,” said Rrrohne; “it’s quite a
revolving cataclysm compared with trying to work an innocent Bill
through this House now the Opposition, having tasted blood at an
all-night sitting, have won two seats at bye-elections. If these
things are done in the dry of a Light Railway Bill, what will it be
in the green of the Education Bill?”
Lighting his short.black clay, doffing his lantern with a jerk, and
muttering an unparliamentary remark about the early time at which
workmen's trains on the Underground are knocked off, the irate
guard set off on his weary walk home.
Business done.—Light Railways Bill blocked again.
Friday.-Chairman of Committee on Private Bills wandering
about House in forlornist mood. Looks as if he had lost his way

day at three o'clock. Takes seat on Treasury Bench. Clerk reads
out list of Private Bills. Fingen, making response, lifts his hat
and says, “To-morrow,” “Thursday,” “Monday,” or whatever day
may be fixed for further procedure. This, all very well once in a

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A FALSTAFFIAN TREE IN THE HAYMARKET,
As SEEN BY RöNTGEN RAYS
ROUNDABOUT READINGS,
“ADVENTURES IN ORITICISM,"
OCCASIONALLY, when I have been suffering from the terrible re-
action caused by reading a bad book, a fearful temptation has
assailed me. Something, not myself, that makes for righteousness
(or, to use Mr. HALL CAINE’s word, for rightness), seems then to
whisper to me, “take your pen in your hand, seclude yourself from
the world and its pleasures, and write a compendium or dictionary
of bad books. Thus :#; profit the public, and i. for #.
self favour and an immortal fame.” So the tempter whispers, but a
few moments of reflection banish the pleasant idea by convincing me
of the hopelessness of the task.
THERE were once two barristers-at-law, vigorous young, men of a
high, spirit, and it occurred to them, as they divided their swift
minds now hither now thither in search of professional advancement,
that no one had yet written a Digest of Overruled Cases, a dictionary,
so to speak, of bad law. So they set to work, secured a kindly pub-
lisher, and in the space of three years produced a monumental work,
in which they brought together in a convenient shape the decided
cases which a later and more enlightened judicial opinion had
robbed of authority and consigned to destruction. By an ingenious
application of the method known to racing men as “Form at a
Glance,” you were enabled to see how a case had run in public since
it was ed up to the moment when, broken down and decrepit, it
had been dismissed by an elaborate dictum of Rhadamanthus, Chan-
cellor, to the knacker's yard. On the analogy of this Digest I
figured to myself a Digest of Disapproved Books, and my mind, pur-
suing the pleasant imagination, seemed...to see some such entry as
the following:-
“THE SATANIST's SUICIDE, 3 vols., 189—. Commented on by daily
ress passin; reviewed by GRANT ALLEN; disapproved by ANDREw
Ang, “a book that might have amused the last moments of an
Aztec on his way to the sacrificial stone, and might still satisfy a
gººmins. for culture;’ finally overruled by A. T. QUILLER
OUCH.
BUT the task, as I said, is hopeless, and I had always to abandon it.
It were otherwise if we appointed our critics as we do our judges, if,
for instance, Mr. ANDREw LANG, by public decree, duly printed in
the Gazette, were one fine day to be prom to a seat on the Bench
of the High Court of Literary Justice, wi per emolument and
any amount of ermine. I can picture the scene, Lord Chief Justice
LANG would take his seat on the morning after his appointment, and
the Attorney-General of Literature—the editor, let us say, of the
Weekly Mentor—would rise in his place, and, in a few well-chosen
words, congratulate the judge on his appointment, recalling the days
when, as #". men, they had ºf: side by side in many a
hard-fought review. Mr. RICHARD LE GALLIENNE would add his
;. on behalf of the Junior Bar, and, without any
further formality; the new Chief Justice would immediately proceed
to dispose of the first book on his list,
THIS, however, being a mere dream of authority, we must content
ourselves with the best substitutes we can devise. erefore I
welcome, with all cordiaº Mr. A. T. QUILLEB Couch's
Adventures in Criticism, lately published by CAssELL & Co. If I
should ever, for my sins, be compelled to draw up a list of “Books
that have done me good.” I should keep a very high place for this
delightful book. It has sanity, tolerance, and, above all, a fresh and
abundant spring of humour. With a light and graceful touch,
Mr. QUILLER CoucH ranges from CHAUCER to THoMASCAREw, thence
to M. Zola, and so on to the “Attitude of the Public towards Letters,”
to Mr. ANTHONY HoPE, Mr. DU MAURIER, and Mr. FRANK Stock-
TON. His air is so gay, his conversation so agreeable, his whole
manner so affable, that you, needs must follow where this easy and
attractive guide leads you, thanking your good fortune that gave you
so g a Companion.
LET it not be assumed from anything that I have said at the
outset of this paper that Mr. QUILLER Couch assumes an Athanasian
attitude towards his authors. On the con , he is apt to praise-
but to praise with discrimination, I do not always agree with him.
For instance, I doubt if he is fair to CALVERLEy, and to others I am
convinced that he is more than fair. But as to CALVERLEY, I confess
that I distrust my own judgment as an infallible guide; for a youth-
ful enthusiasm leaves its traces in maturity, and the grown man
shrinks from depreciating that which delighted him as a boy. For
me CALyERLEY is unapproachable, not merely when I think of him
as a writer of light verse of the most extraordinary finish and felicity,
but also when I remember his beautiful version of THEochITUS.
STILL, even when one disagrees with Mr. QUILLER Couch, one
disagrees with hesitation, and a moment af 5 disagreement
is certain to give place to a hearty assent... After reading his book I
feel as if I had cleared my mind of all manner of humbug and
nonsense. There is more sound sense in (to take gnly two instances)
“The Attitude of the Public towards Letters” and “The Poor Little
Penny Dreadful” than in all the pompous and magistral sermonisings
that pass for criticism with the great Public, and are afterwards
republished and forgotten. Without wishing to tread upon the
dangerous ground of comparison, I. may say that Mr. QUILLER
Couch's essays produce upon my mind a sort of mixed effect of
HazlıTT and CHARLEs LAMB. He has something of the penetrating
directness of the one and not a little of the whimsical playfulness of
the other. And he has his own qualities peculiar to himself which
make his writings a pleasure.
DARBY JONES ON THE ROYAL. HUNT CUP.
s
HonourED SIR,--Despite the fact that no cheques or postal order
have rewarded my sin talent in discovering the Royal winner of
the Derby, obedient to #. command I venture to place before you
and your rºaders an inkling, written in pencil, as to the successful
candidate for the Hunt Cup at Ascot. Here it is:-
“At Ascot I'm a Mascot,
Don't quarrel with the Easter boon I tip,
Though I own a sheep's condition
May disclose the imposition
Of a quack who can't a young-old man outstrip.”
In the above Homeric lines you have, Ifancy, the essence of this
great event faithfully Liebigged. Hearing that you have, since the
Epsom victory, been feeding your dog Toby on mutton chops, while
regaling yourself with magnums, not in parvo, I take leave to
remind you that crumbs from the table of Dives are not despised by
Your obedient Servant, DARBY JONES.

It is the part of the wise man to treat all his neighbours with kind-
ness, but most of all those who are to serve as judges, in the race
wherein he runs. Some there are who complain of this practice
alleging that it is unjust. But the illustrious SocRATEs has proved
it to be otherwise, for, as he says, we offer sacrifices to the gods to
win their favour, so that we, rather than our antagonists, may succeed
in our business. Why then should we not give gifts to the umpires,
who are indeed in the place of the gods at the Games, and award the
prizes to those whom they think fit? Wherefore it is good that the
runner offer sacrifices of drink to the umpire, and so, perchance,
even if he arrive last at the goal, all his rivals will be disqualified. :, ;
Concerning those who contend with clubs and ball, care is n

with anger to fly from their tongue. For indeed it is a shameful
thing for a man to speak unseemly things because, the earth having
been seventeen times smitten with the club, the ball remains in the
bushes. Rather let him pursue his way in the silence of the
philosopher, perchance sacrificing one or two of those who bear
clubs, S to appease the wrath of the gods. Nor let these competitºrs
be allowed, as the manner of some is, to bewail, on their return...the

OLD THYME AND ROSEMARY.
MESSRs. PARKER AND CARson's Rosemary is not as strong as Mr.
PINERO's Sweet Lavender; yet 'tis a very pretty play. The authors'
delineation of the central figure gives just that sweet-homely ſº oom-
pound adjective, somewhat suggestive, of," sweet, omelette”) and
jº. English domestic flavour to the dish which has rarely ever
n. Known to fail in its effect on the sentiment of the genuine
English playgoer; and more especially telling, is it with the less
experienced playgoeress. The craze for the costume of the earliest
part of the nineteenth cen-
tury was, some years ago,
started by KATE GREEN-
Away and RANDoD PH
CALDECOTT, and has long
been recognised in the
Academy as the happy
hunting grounds of MAR
CUs Stone, Boughton, and
ORCHARDson; and though
by now the flame has well-
nigh flickered out, except
for the Academicians above
named, yet there still exists
an artistic feminine curi-
osity, which is anxious to
learn exactly how their
grandmothers and great-
grandmothers looked, at
eighteen years of age, when

was a period of side-
curls, large bonnets, and
short skirts, not so very
unbecoming a costume,
after all, if we are to judge
by the appearance of Miss
MARY_MooRE as Dorothy
Cruickshank, aged, 18 in
the year 1837. But the
attire of the young lover of
that period, aged 21, is
hopelessly absurd; and if
Dorothy had possessed any
of the artistic talent asso-
ciated with the name of
CRUIKSHANK (“GEORGE”
of that ilk), she could never
have allowed her intended
to go about town in so
ridiculous a suit of clothes

In this piece #. have the costume of three periods: that of
the old ple, like The Naval Captain and Professor. Jogram,
both of whom seem to belong to the time of Commodore Trunnion;
then that of Sir Jasper, who is, I should §: about twenty
ears their junior; then...you have the Dendy-Sadierian old post-
; and, to finish º with, we see the costumes of the Queen's
Jubilee year, when there are French waiters in London, and Sir
Jasper, a nonogenarian (that is, if he was forty years of age in
the first act, the last act being fifty years after), appears in
the dress of an old gentleman, a riveur, quite up to date. But Sir
Jasper at forty, in Act I., seems quite young enough, in spite of his
evidently assumed paternal air, to become the husbando Dorothy,
aged eighteen. Yet he is not; and when Jogram, being interested in
the Squire's remaining a bachelor, points this out to him, the Squire
perceives that disparity of years is a bar to happiness in marriage,
and sensibly gives up the game, subsiding, nay, collapsing suddenly,
into “the rere and yellow.” This, by the way, is not the doctrine
of CHARLEs Dickens as set forth in the touching episode where “Mr.
Dick fulfils my, Aunt's prediction.” And here is exactly where the
º so thin, that, in the last act, it is whittled away to nothing.
ow in this third act, Sir Jasper aged 90, has to find, in a hole in
the wall, a paper placed there by him. fifty years before. When he
dºes come across it, at first it recalls nothing, although the occasion
of his hiding the paper was the event of his middle life. Gradually

it recalls the sprig of rosemary which Dorothy had divided with
him. Now a strange thing happens. Sir Jasper produces the
pocket-book in which fifty years ago he has placed that very
sprig of rosemary, and which, with the sprig in it, he has,
it must be assumed, invariably carried about with him ; #.
in spite of this ever - present memento having been with him
through all mortal changes of goats, fashions, and pocket-books,
he has, up to this minute, * forgotten the unique occasion
when it was É. him, and when he, on the mpetus of the
moment, purchased the
house which would be "ºn
erpetuam memoriam rei.”
#. these circumstances,

Headless Man in any other

first see him, he, from sheer
light-heartedness, does not
trouble himself to remem-
ber names.—is sº im-
possible. Had he ſº the
sprig for years and re-
covered it, had the house
passed into other hands
and had he never revisi
it till this moment, then,
by some extraordinary in-
spiration, the whole scene
might have been repro-
duced in his imagination,
or (and very effective this
dream, as he sat there, the
solitary viveur, Marius
among the ruins of a dead
past, the touching scene
could have been re-enacted.
In fact, the action of the
play just barely developes
a hint of an excellent idea
which might have been “so
infinitely betterexpressed.’
The acting all round
leaves nothing to be de-
sired. CHARLEs WYNDHAM
is at his best. Miss MooRE
is charming. Mr. Bishop,

Messrs. PARKER and CARson may be quite satisfied with the result
of their work, and as “the young person” and the “reverand gent”
can, see it without fear of being startled out of their propriety, and,
as there is just a touch of DICKENs in it, if the authors interchange
initials and style themselves “CARKER and PARSon,” it will satisfy
all the requirements of the case. -
Of course the costumes “of the periods” go for much, picturesquely,
towards the success. But if success in comedy were to be dependent
on costume, what a fine chance, as far as novelty goes, would the
costumes of the Noah's Ark period have, with the characters in the

YEARs ago, Mr. Punch, Sir, you had a splendid cartoon about two

eir mess comrades. It was in the days, Sir, when the Duke had
st been made General Commanding-in-Chief; and since then, and

ley were, neither of them, considered righ enough to r the
ſpenses of life in barracks. One of these lads was asked where he
as going to keep his hunters and racers, and when he said he

herefore he had joined the regiment. Then, when the answers
ere considered unsatisfactory, his fate was made an unhappy one.

ation.
Now Mr. Punch, Sir, in these days, when the purchase system is
bolished, and a lot of us rankers look forward to getting away from
le canteen into better quarters, it is a matter of importance that
lose above us should not be only officers but gentlemen. If the

Of course, Sir, discipline is discipline, and it is not for the likes of
me to give ordersto our superiors; still I do think that now flogging
is abolished as “degrading,” the prestige of the Service should be
further maintained by allowing the rank-and-file to be commanded,
as in days of yore, by gentlemen. So, as a pretty strong charge has
been made, there should be a searching inquiry. And that is the
opinion of all of us—front rank, rear rank, and supernumeraries.

YEARs ago, Mr. Punch, Sir, you had a splendid cartoon abut two

their mess comrades. It was in the days, Sir, when the Duke hai

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
FREDERICK LockeR-LAMPSON was fortunate in two respects when
writing the volume published under the title My Confidences. The
first is the conception of its scheme. In a second title he describes the
work as An Autobiographical Sketch addressed to my Descendants.
Incidentally it is published by SMITH, ELDER & Co., and all the
world who have fifteen shillings to spend, or can borrow the book
may read it...So careful was the diarist that his children and his
.#. children should have the confidences presented in most
perfect, polished form, that he had the MS. set up in type, and
bestowed upon it final affectionate revision, before he died. Still it
holds the privileged position of a communication privily addressed
to a family circle. If the public don't like it, they can leave it.
In spite of the printing and proof-reading, it was not meant for
them, only for “my dear children,” to whom any trivial incident in
the daily life of a revered parent is interesting, any little exhibition
of vanity a sacred weakness. Thus the gifted author, may indulge
in impaſse of his most trivial moods, none daring to make him afraid.
Happily in Mr. LocKER's case this condition is controlled "w.
§ heart, a bright intellect, and a highly cultured mind. e
are privileged to look on at the playtime of a courtly, scholarly
gentleman, and frankly share his innocent satisfaction in the really
wide circle of acquaintance among members of the aristocracy and less
eminent personages, such as DEAN STANLEY, ALFRED TENNyson,
MATTHEW ARNOLD, Mr. LECKY, and MILLAIs, “who etched my
portrait.”. This last does not sº to have given supreme satisfac.
tion. “There are points,” Mr. LoCKER writes, in one of those
delightful asides that reveal his nature, “where MILLAIs almost
surpasses the great Dutchman, FRANZ HALs. But he wants charm,
...]" do not see in his faces that passing look, that exquisitely
evanescent expression which appears about to change even as we
gaze.” When we read Sir John's “Confidences,” perhaps we shall
hear what he thought of Mr. LoCKER as a subject. Meanwhile the
book is one to be read right through. My Baronite thinks the gem of
the collection will be found in the exquisitely humorous account of Mr.
LocKER's defeat in his attempt to complete his SHAKSPEARE folio of
1623 by purchase of the missing leaf with BEN Jonson's verses. The
other good fortune, in addition to the happy design of the book, is in
the choice of editor. Mr. BIRRELL, who fills that position, has doubt-
less supplemented Mr. LockeR's affectionate revision of the typed
sheets. But, save by a preface strictly limited to the measure of a
sonnet, he does not obtrude his personality by a single note. This
modesty is rarely precious in the editor of a biographical work.
There seems no limit to the capacity of CLARK RUSSELL to pro-
duce stirring stories of the sea. He has so long and so closely
communed with the illimitable ocean that he has acquired something
of its power and its infinite variety. His latest story, The Tale of
the Ten (CHATro AND WINDUs) is as good as anything he has yet
the action is more rapid., Once started with the story, my Baronite
found it difficult to lay the book down till he had seen comfortably
shot, or hanged, everyone of the Ten. This desire is, through a series
of breathless incidents, fulfilled. Like the Ten Little Niggers of
earlier fame, the rogues drop off one by one, “and then there were”
only just enough to send to Norfolk Island. The story, skilfully
constructed, graphically told, is adorned with some of those maº.
vellous descriptions of the many moods of the sea in which CLARK
RUSSELL is unapproachable. THE BARON.
PASTRY OF THE PAST.
SIR,-The “Elderly Correspondent” of the Lancet who asks where
is the pastry of our youth, “the crisp and saccharous tartlet, the
delicate puff, the imponderable dumpling,” has hit on a real
grievance. As for tartlets, I feel inclined to sing with Mrs. HEMANs
(I think), “O call those tartlets back to me!’ Puffs—well—I believe
that these are sometimes heard of still, in literary circles, but they
are never “delicate,” and the kind sold at the confectioners' ought
to be used for ship ballast—they're fit for nothing else. What's the
good of a new Education Bill, technical classes, and all that, if cooks
aren't taught to use the rolling pin P Why, it’s
PUFFICKLY Monsteous.
SIR,-This crusade against modern pastry is most excellent. But
it should also include modern sweets. I ate some almond toffee the
other day, and, would º believe it, it nearly inade me sick | It
never did that when I was a boy, sixty years ago. How well I
remember munching it on our playground while loºking on at our
first eleven heroes licking (at cricket) the contemptible fellows sent
by some other school to play us! The Bath pipe that I and
SNIGGLINGs junior swore eternal friendship over—where is that sort
of Bath pipe now P Wanished—in smokel Gone out—with a puff l
Yours, PUFF Collusive.
SIR,--It is quite true about the pastry and the rolling-pin. But
the real reason why pastry doesn't agree with us nowadays is because
of all the nasty foreign ingredients put in it. Russian flour, French
butter, German eggs—how can you expect a thing made in Germany
to be digested in England? And that leads me to the chief point of
this letter, which is to say that we must have PROTECTION! I gene-
rally manage tº bring all arguments round to that, and I’m glad to
have been able to do so in this instance.
Yours hopefully, JIMMYLOWTHERITE.
SIR,-My boy tells me it's all rot about the puffs at confectioners
not being as good as ever. He asked for sixpence to go and try, in
order—as he said—to “make quite sure about it,” and as he felt a
little doubtful at the end of the experiment, I gave him another
sixpence to complete it. He finished them all ! ...Yet there are people
who declare that modern pastry can't be digested!

Great enthusiasm after finale of second act

end of his first dinner-party. At finish of

When bouquets are handed up publicly,
the names of donors should be announced also
publicly. This would add to the value of
the bouquet. Signor BEVIGNANI would an-

Great enthusiasm after finale of second act
only equalled by perturbation of singers, who,
like Barkis, were “willin’,” but could do

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday. June 8.-" Man and boy,” said
SARK, “I’ve lived in House of Commons for twenty-five years.
Never till to-night was I so sharply struck with sense of the innate
nobility, the pure unselfishness, the impulsive generosity of
Members.” -
What caused SARK's voice to falter, almost brought tears into
his eyes, was the readiness shown from unexpected quarters to
forward public business, by closing debate on second rºading Irish
Land Bill. Arranged when House met that two nights should be
given up to talk round subject. PRINCE ARTHUR, apprehensive that
even that allotment of time would be insufficient, gave notice that
he will to-morrow move suspension Twelve o'clock Rule, so that
debate may, if need be, continue all night. Suddenly movement in
favour of completing de-
bate at current sitting had
birth. Rapidly grew till,
by ten o'clock, Bill read
second time, leaving two
hours to discuss proposal to
º it to Grand Commit-
ee.
It was TIM HEALY began
it. After long absence,
TIM back again at corner

On his left sits dark-vis-

that melted the icy trucu-

ever it be, having spoken
OF
for something over half an
hour (and said all he had
to say) gladdened
heart of Ministers by pro-
testing that he really did
not care about extending
debate.
“Take your Closure at
once,” he said. “It is not
we who will oppose it or
cry "Gag l’ when it is
granted from the Chair.”
Not to be outdone in
generosity, Colonel SAUN-
DERson, who followed, took
the same line. No use

in bºsom of his constituency. This place of . was literally
represented by, the middle of the main thoroughfare, where the
hon. Member, flat on his back, off which his coat, had been torn,
seems to, have spent a pensive hour, with the policeman who had
knocked him down ottrusively standing over him.
. Bitterest reflection was that he had reached this recumbent posi-
tion whilst bent upon an errand of peace. Coming together in the
quiet streets of Clare on a Sabbath morning, WILLIE R.'s con-
stituents and the police had incontinently “gone for’’ each other.
The ** of Peace interposing, straightway found himself in the
requmbent position, described. It was nothing to him ; he seemed
uite used to spending his Sunday morning in such circumstances.
What vexed, him was (1) that his recumbent position, prevented
his pursuing his mission of peace; (2) that the overhanging police-
man was not conveniently numbered as are his colleagues in the
streets ºf London. Whence
ensued insuperable difficul-
ties in recognising him and
bringing him into a posi-
tion where the ground of
his almost rude conduct
might be inquired into.

HAVEN'T much time for jotting down impressions. More's the
pity, as, with my School Board learning, I am getting quite a dab at
composition. But what with tent- pegging, musical rides, sword and
bayonet contests, and the rest of it, there's quite enough to do. It
pleases the public, I suppose, and the funds go to some Service
chºrity or other, so that's all right, and the Intelligence. De-
partment says it “promotes recruiting,” so that 's all right,
too. ...And then the management is re-organised. Not too much of
the Volunteers—just a noble C.O. of the auxiliaries thrown in to
give a civilian but aristocratic flavour to the show—and that's, from
a Service point of view, all right again. But as the Commander-in-
Chief was using one of his precious new brooms and sweeping some
more of the old traditions away into the dust-hole, why didn't he get
rid of “dressing-up” P Of course, I don't mean the dressing-up of the
barrack-yard, but the painting-your-face-red dressing-up of Mr.
CLARKSON, or some other eminent perruquier.
It's all very well to show the ten-shilling seat-holders “the sons of

kindly taken it under his own special patronage, but surely the line

A HARROWED ETONIAN.
SIR,-In your edition of June 13, you published an essay on the
Fourth of June purporting to be the work of “JoyNEs MINob.” I
don’t know if the writer, by appropriating the name of an honoured
bygone preceptor, endeavoured to pose as an Etonian, but if he were
so, indeed, he must have been a very old one. His reference to Joby
savours of the pliocene age, that excellent judge of small beer having
long been gathered to his fathers. Then he talks of KosMo WILKIN-
son, cox of the Thetis, arrayed in an admiral's uniformſ Shades of
aii defunct Captains of the Boatºr Whoever saw the steerer of the
Thetis in a cocked hat? The garb of NELson is reserved for those
who hold the lines in the Upper Boats, And then “JoyNEs MINOR,”
for the sake of reference to the Heir Apparent's success at Epsom
has the effrontery to say that the leading boats were the Victory and
Prince of Wales, whereas every real Etonian knows that the ten-oar
(the only one on the river) is always the Monarch of all it surveys,
being stroked by that most magnificent personage, the Captain of the
Boats!, Lastly, “J., M.” wrongly makes the Brocas, the scene of
BRock's fireworks, which did not go off “brilliantly,” owing to the
proverbial rain. Šiº, I know not with whom to be the more indig-
nant, you or “JoyNES MINOR,” whose father must have more money

IN_the_Times for June 17, Admiral P. H. Colomb writes d propos
of “The Higher Policy of Defence”:—
“For myself, I am eminently content with the part I have played, and
recognise with pleasure the arrival of a time of rest.”

A HARROWED ETONIAN.
SIR,-In your edition of June 13, you published an essay on the
Fourth of June purporting to be the work of “Joynes MINob.” I
don’t know if the writer, by *...* the name of an honoured
bygone preceptor, endeavoured to pose as an Etonian, but if he were
so, indeed, he must have been a very old one. His reference to JoBY
savours of the pliocene age, that excellent judge of small beer having
long been gathered to his fathers. Then he talks of KosMo WILKIN-
son, cox of the Thetis, arrayed in an admiral's uniform 1 Shades of
all defunct Captains of the Boats! Who ever saw the steerer of the
Thetis in a cocked hat? The garb of NELson is reserved for those
who hold the lines in the Upper Boats. And then “JoyNEs MINoR,”
for the sake of reference to the Heir Apparent's success at Epsom
has the effrontery to say that the leading boats were the Victory an
Prince of Wales, whereas every real Etonian knows that the ten-oar
(the only one on the river) is always the Monarch of all it surveys,
being stroked by that most magnificent personage, the Captain of the
Boats!, Lastly, “J. M.” wrongly makes the Brocas the scene of
BRock's fireworks, which did not go off “brilliantly,” owing to the
proverbial rain. Šiº, I know not with whom to be the more indig-
nant, you or “JoyNEs MINoR,” whose father must have more money
than sense, if he did indeed tip him a “fiver”!
And then he talks of “Buns.” THORNTON. “Bun and Jam” was
the sobriquet of our great slogger. “Buns” was a later reading,
invented # those, who did not share his effective society at the
College of the Blessed Virgin. The sham Etonian is as readily de-
tec as is the false nobleman. He may be able to talk about
“absence,” “swishing,” “tick,” and “drybobs,” but there are
certain little passwords which he can never get hold of. For
instance, I will bet a sovereign to a halfpenny that Lord GRANBy of
Lord ARTHUR WELLESI.EY would know in an instant at what house I
boarded, when I state that my room at my e's was on “the
lower sarg.”. In my opinion, “JoyNES MINOR” hails from Harrow,
where, § at “Ducker,” or whatever the hill-toplads call their
swimming bath, he picked up a few light-blue expressions from the
renegade (no offence meant) WELLDon.

WITH THE ACCENT ON THE PENULTIMATE SYDLABLE.-A French
diplomat, in proposing Lord DUFFERIN's health; hoped that his Lord-
ship would find some pretext for Duf-fer-rin’ his departure from
arls,
A HARROWED ETONIAN.
SIR,-In your edition of June 13, you published an essay on the
Fourth of June purporting to be the work of “JoyNEs MINob.” I
don’t know if the writer, by appropriating the name of an honoured
bygone preceptor, endeavoured to pose as an Etonian, but if he were
so, indeed, he must have been a very old one. His reference to JoBY
savours of the pliocene age, that excellent judge of small beer having
long been gathered to his fathers. Then he talks of KosMo WILKIN-
son, cox of the Thetis, arrayed in an admiral's uniformſ Shades of
all defunct Captains of the Boatºr Whoever saw the steerer of the
Thetis in a cocked hat? The garb of NELson is reserved for those
who hold the lines in the Upper Boats, And then “JoyNEs MINoH,”
for the sake of reference to the Heir Apparent's success at Epsom
has the effrontery to say that the leading boats were the Victory and
Prince of Wales, whereas every real Etonian knows that the ten-oar
(the only one on the river) is always the Monarch of all it surveys,
being stroked by that most magnificent personage, the Captain of the
Boats!, Lastly, “J., M.” wrongly makes the Brocas, the scene of
BRock's fireworks, which did not go off “brilliantly,” owing to the
proverbial rain. Sir, I know not with whom to be the more indig-
nant, you or “JoyNEs MINoR,” whose father must have more money
than sense, if he did indeed tip him a “fiver” l
And then he talks of “Buns.” THORNTON. “Bun and Jam” was
the sobriquet of our great slogger. “Buns” was a later reading,
invented those, who did not share his effective society at the
College of the Blessed Virgin. The sham Etonian is as readily de-
tected as is the false nobleman. He may be able to talk about
“absence,” “swishing,” “tick,” and “drybobs,” but there are
certain little, passwords which he can never get hold of. For
instance, I will bet a sovereign to a halfpenny that Lord GRANBy of
Lord ARTHUR WELLESLEY would know in an instant at what house I
boarded, when I state that my room at my dame's was on “the
lower sarg.”. In my opinion, “JoyNEs MINoR” hails from Harrow,
where, §: at “Ducker,” or whatever the hill-toplads call their
swimming bath, he picked up a few light-blue expressions from the
renegade (no offence meant) WELLDon.

ments. At the Tower the canons were loaded with chains and abuse

JOTTINGS AND TITTLINGS.
(By BABoo HURRY BUNGsHo JABBERJEE, B.A.)
No. XW.
Mr. Jabberjee is asked out to dinner. Unreasonable behaviour of
his betrothed. His doubts concerning the social advantages of a
Boarding Establishment, with some scathing remarks upon
ambitious pretenders. He goes out to dinner, and meets a
person of some importance.
THE pleasing impression produced by this humble self upon both
Mister, and Mrs. ALLBuTT-INNETT at the wedding of their eldest
daughter became speedily prolific of golden fruit in the request of
the honour of my company for dinner at 8.15 P.M. on a subsequent
evenlng.
Incidentally recounting this prime, compliment to my, lovely
JESSIMINA, I was astounded that she did not share my jubilations,
but was, on the contrary, the sore subject at not being included in
such invitation, which, as I explained, was totally irrational, seeing
that the inviters remained unaware
of her nude existence. She, how-
ever, maintained that I ought to
have mentioned that I was an
affianced, and have refused to sit
at any banquet at which she was
fobbed off with a cold shoulder.
This again was absurd, since the
moiety of a loaf is preferable to
total deprivation of the staff of
life, and moreover, in my country,
it is customary for the husband-
elect to take his meals apart from
his bride that is to be; nor does
she ever touch food until he has
previously assuaged his pangs of
unger. Notwithstanding, she
would not be pacified until I had
bestowed upon her a gold and tur-
quoise ring of best. English work:
manship, as an olive-branch and
calumet of peace.
But, outside Porticobello House,
I have been close as wax on the
subject of my flowery chains, and
it was especially inconceivable that
I should inform my friend HowARD
of same, since he has frequently
bantered me in wonderment that:
respectable Orientalmagnate should
reside in such a very ordinary and
third-rate boarding establishment,
where it was an impossibility to
gain any real familiarity with smart
and refined English society.
And who knows that if I should
introduce Miss JESSIE into com-
# of a superior caste, some
aughty masculine might insult
her under my very nose; and lack-
a-daisyl where would she find a
protector?
I am certainly oppressed by an increasing dubiety whether Mrs.
MANKLETow is verily such an upper crustacean and habituée of the
beau monde as she did represent herself to be. It is well-nigh
incomprehensible that, any individual should seek to appear of a
higher social status than Nature has provided; but my youthful
acquaintance, ALLBUTT-INNETT, Jun., Esq., informs me that this is
a common failing among the #nglish classes, who fondly imagine
that nothing is needed to render a frog the exact equivalent to an
ox except an increased quantity of air, forgetting that if a frog is
abnormally inflated, it is apt to provide the rather ludicrous catas-
trophe of exploding from excessive swellishness!
However, revenons d nos moutons-idest, the dinner party.
I intended to be the early bird at Prince's Square, but, owing to a
rarity among the hansom cabs, did not arrive until most of the
guests were already assembled, being welcomed with effusive hos-
itality by the household god and goddess, Mr. and Mrs. ALLBUTT-
NNETT, who begged leave to present to me all the most distinguished
of their friends. -
Then-pop, and d l'improviste-the door was thrown open, and a
butler announced ore rotundo, Sir CHETwynd CUMMERBUND, whom,
in the wink of an eye, I recognised as an ex-Justice of the very
Court in Calcutta in which my male progenitor practises as a mook.

almost abovo, having been more than once humbly presented to his
notice by my said father, with a request for his patronising opinion
“Some haughty masculine might insult her under my
: 3. Williº, and the feasibility of my education at a London Inn
of Court
Oh, my gracious ! I was as if to sink through the carpet, and
sought to draw in my horns behind a column, when, to my uncon-
trollable dismay, my hostess led him towards me, with the remark
that he was probably already acquainted in India with His Highness
Prince JABBERJEE, -
The Hon'ble Retired Judge at this did merely smile indulgently,
observing that India was a country of considerable extensiveness,
and inquiring of me in my own tongue where my raj was situated,
and the strength of my army, though with a scintillation in his
visual organs that told me he knew me perfectly well. -
d I, realising that honesty was my best policy of insurance
from his displeasure, did throw myself frankly on the mercy of the
Court, protesting volubly in native language that I was an
industrious poor Bengali boy, and had lº. regarded him as my
beloved father; that I was not to blame because certain foolish,
ignorant persons imagined me to be some species of Rajah; and
earnestly representing to him that our kind mutual hostess would be
--- woefully distressed #. any dis-
closures. “Let your Hon’ble Lud-
ship,” I said, “only remain her-
metically sealed, and preserve this
as a trade secret, and my sisters
sisters-in-law, and aunts shall
always chant hymns on the Ganges
for your Honor's felicities!”
His Honor, laughing good-na-
turedly, did tell me that if I liked
to assume the plumes of a daw, it
was no affair of his, and kindly
promised to respect my confidences
-at which I was greatly relieved.
Indeed, throughout the evening,
nothing could exceed his affability,
for, being seated on the other side
of the hostess, opposite myself, he
showed me the greatest honour and
deference, frequently requesting m
views on such subjects as Increas
Representation of the People of
India, the National Congress, and
so forth; upon which, being now
Fº. reassured and at my ease
discoursed with facundity, an
! did loudly extol the intellectual
capacity of the Bengalis, as evinced
by marvellous success in passing
most difficult exams., and de-
nouncing it as a crying injustice
and beastly shame that fullest
political powers should not be con-
ceded to them, and that they
should not be eligible for all civil
appointments part passu, or even
in priority to Englishmen.
herein his Honor did warmly
agree, assuring me with º
benignancy of the pleasure wi
>. which he would hear of my appoint-
very nose. ment to be, Head of a District
somewhere on the Punjab frontier, and mentioning how a certain
native Bengali gentleman of his acquaintange, Deputy-Commissioner
GRISH, CHUNDER Df, Esq., M.A., had distinguished himself splen-
didly (according to the printed testimony of Hon'ble KIPLING) in
such a É. of danger. - -
I replied, that I was not passionately in love with personal danger,
and that in my case cedant arma togae, and my tongue was mightier
than my sword, but that there was no doubt that we Bengalis were
intellectually competent to govern the whole country, provided only
that we were backed up from behind by a large English military
force to uphold our authority, as otherwise we should, soon be the
pretty pickles, owing to brutal violence from Sikhs, Rajputs,
Maraºhas, and similar uncivilised coarse races. -
And Sir CHETwynn expressed his lively satisfaction that I appre-
ciated some of the advantages of the British ºccupation. -
Thus, through my presence of mind in boldly grap.ling with the
nettle, I turned what might have bean a disaster into a conspicuous
triumph, for all the company, seeing the favour I was in with such a
big wig as Hon’ble. CUMMERBUND, listened to me with spell-bound
enchantment, especially my friend Howard's sprightly young sister,
a damsel of distinguished personal attractiveness, who was seated on
my other side. Her birth-name is Louisa-GyenDoI.E.N. ; but her
family and intimates, so she did inform me, call her “WEE-WEE,”
Of the dinner itself I can speak highly, as being inexpressibly
superior, both in stylishness of service and for the quality of the

food, &c., to any meals hitherto furnished by Mrs. MANKLETow's
mahogany board. Nevertheless, I wondered to find the ALLBUTT-
INNETTs behind the times in one respect, viz., the lighting, which
was with old-fashioned candles and semi-obscured lamps, instead of
the more modern and infinitely more brilliant illumination of gas!
Here, at least, though in other particulars of very mediocre elegance,
I must pronounce Porticobello House the more up to date.
In taking leave, I did thank Hon’ble Sir CHETwyND CUMMER-
BUND profusely for so discreetly retaining its feline contents within
the generous bag of his mouth, whereat he clapped my back very
cordially, advising me to abstain for the future from a super-
abundance of frills, since the character of a diligent legal native
student was a precious lily that needed no princely gilding, and
adding that he was indebted to me for a most entertaining and
mirthful evening. This I do not understand, as I had not uttered
any of the facetious puns and conceits wherewith it is my wont—
when I will"—to set tº: table in a simper.
But possibly I may have spoken rather, humorously unawares
and it is proverbial that these exalted legal luminaries are pleased
with a rattle and tickled by a straw. ...
On my return I did omit to mention Miss WEE-WEE to JESSIMINA;

DICKENS'S DOMBEY AND SARDOU'S SARA,
SIR,-Last week your critic gave a brief notice of SARA BERNBARDT
in La Tosca. Every one conversant with the play remembers the great
situation when La Tosca clutches up the knife from the supper-table
and confronts her would-be lover, the “bold bad man,” chief of the
police, with the cruel smile and the lustful #3; Happening, by
merest accident, to take down from a book-shelf CHARLEs DICKENs's
Dombey and Son, what do I find, in the scene between Edith
Dombey and Carker of the gleaming teeth? This:–
“He was coming gaily towards her, when, in an instant, she caught the
knife up from the table, and started one pace back.”
The exact situation in La Tosca. Only—Edith did not stab
Carker. SARDou went a step farther than DICKENs, and made the
hit dramatically. But as “Todgers's could do it when it liked,” so
l)1CKENs, when going in for melodrama, could come out uncommonly
strong, and did so, too.
By the way, let any one who comes across this note refer to
that chapter (it is the twenty-fourth, in the second volume), and,
after noting how carefully the supper for two had been prepared, let
him wonder, who, ate it?... Edith didn't; Carker, didn't. Did
Dombey, arriving late, get it? Qr did the waiters collar it, by way
of perquisites, next morning P Also, who paid for it?
ut genius is above details. Šimply we come back to the situation
where Edith Dombey is the forerunner of La Tosca, as we see it played
by SARA SIDDons BERNHARDT. Yours, Joe BAGSTOCK.
WHAT CAPTAIN S-M-NDs, THE L. C. C. FIREMAN, FoReoT.—To in-
HENLEY REGATTA IN 1900 A.D.
[“The foreign entries at Henley are more numerous than ever.”—Daily
Paper.]
THE usually quiet little Oxfordshire town of Henley has been the
scene of some regrettable disturbances resulting in a loss of life,
which it is, at the present time, impossible to compute. At the
moment of sending this despatch, comparative peace has been re-
A. stored, owing to the presence of two
ſ - infantry regiments and one of cavalry,
w together with a º of artillery.
These have occupied the training
quarters of the crews, while detach-
– ments are constantly patrolling the
s principal streets. Further reinforce-
ments have just been sent for at the
urgent request of the Mayor of Henley,
who waited on the Colonel commandin
with a bandage over his right eye an
his arm in a sling. These injuries were
received by him in the courageous exe-
------ * cution of his duty as chief magistrate
of the town. The stewards of the Regatta, those of them, that is
to say, who survive, are in permanent session in the Town Hall,
the ºut of which have been strengthened by sand-bags, while a
guard of 500 picked men is di in and about the building.
It is difficult in the excited state of public feeling to arrive at the
exact truth of what happened. It seems, however, that in the first
heat of the Grand Challenge Cup for Eights, the Matabele onauts
(with the Bucks station) were drawn against the Sons of the Nile
from the Soudan. In the second heat the Ojibbeway Leanders
were to compete against the lately formed Eskimo Boat Club.
Owing, however, to some mistake, arising, probably, from a defective
knowledge of English, the Ojibbeways came to the post in the first
heat, and insisted on starting. The Matabele oarsmen and the Sons
of the Nile, naturally enough, protested, and their protest was
backed by the Umpire, who ordered the Red Indians off the course.
They refused to move, and their stroke, Sw1NGING BUFFALo, in a
moment of intense irritation, clambered out of his racing ship on to
the launch, and, before the horrified spectators could realise what
was happening, he had scalped Mr. FRANK WILLAN, and was waving
his bloody trophy frantically in the air. Directly afterwards he fell
pierced to the heart by a well directed assegai, hurled by the arm o
QQMATOFLOPoçAs, the coxswain of the Matabele Eight. In a moment
all was confusion and carnage. The spectators on the banks and in
the water took º the quarrel, and a hideous scene of promiscuous
massacre ensued. The air
became black with the |
arrows of the Ojibbeways, , ,
the assegais of the Matabele
and the spears of the fierce t
Soudanese Arabs...The local º
volunteers and the county ºf
police were powerless to F
quell the conflict, which
raged without interruption =
for three hours. The river sº,

of house-boats and craft of Gº.

out of the water and laid in rows for identification. It is gratifying
to note that on this occasion Russians, Germans, Frenchmen, Italians,
Dutchmen, Spaniards, Americans, and Englishmenforgot their inter-
national rivalries, and fought side by side in defence of law and order.
The incident has, unfortunately, rendered it necessary to cancel the
Regatta fixture, and all entrance-fees will be returned to the captains
of crews, or to their executors and administrators.

I intended to be the early bird at Prince's Square, but, owing to a
rarity among the hansom cabs, did not arrive until most of the
guests were already, assembled, *. welcomed with effusive hos-
itality by the household god and goddess, Mr. and Mrs. ALLBUTT-
NNETT, who begged leave to present to me all the most distinguished
of their friends. -
Then-pop, and d l'improviste—the door was thrown open, and a
butler announced ore rotundo, Sir CHETwyND CUMMERBus D, whom,
in the wink of an eye, I recognised as an ex-justice of the very
Court in Calcutta in which my male progenitor practises as a mook-
tear, or attorney, and who, moreover, was familiar with myself
almost abovo, having been more than once humbly presented to his
notice by my said father, with a request for his patronising opinion
“Some haughty masculine might insult her under my very nose.”
somewhere on the Punjab frontier, and mentioning how a certain
native Bengali gentleman of his acquaintange, Deputy-Commissioner
of my abilities, and the feasibility of my education at a London i
of Court |
Oh, my gracious! I was as if to sink through the carpet, and
sought to draw in my horns behind a column, when, to my uncon-
trollable dismay, my hostess led him towards me, with the remark
that he was probably already acquainted in India with His Highness
Prince JABBERJEE,
The Hon'ble Retired Judge at this did merely smile indulgently,
observing that India was a country of considerable extensiveness,
and inquiring of me in my own tongue where my raj was situated,
and the strength of my army, though with a scintillation in his
visual organs that told me he knew me perfectly well. -
And I, realising that honesty was my best policy of insurance
from his displeasure, did throw myself frankly on the mercy of the
Court, protesting volubly in native language that I was an
industrious poor Bengali boy, and had lº. regarded him as my
beloved father; that I was not to blame because certain foolish
ignorant persons imagined me to be some species of Rajah; and
earnestly representing to him that our kind mutual hostess would be
--- woefully distressed by any dis-
£ºs - closures. “Let your Hon’ble Lud-
a … ship,” I said, “only remain her-
metically sealed, and preserve this
as a trade secret, and my sisters
sisters-in-law, and aunts aii
always chant hymns on the Ganges
for your Honor's felicities!”
His Honor, laughing good-na-
turedly, did tell me that if I liked
to assume the plumes of a daw, it
was no affair of his, and kindly
promised to respect my confidences
-at which I was greatly relieved.
Indeed, throughout the evening,
nothing could exceed his affability,
for, being seated on the other side
of the hostess, opposite myself, he
showed me the greatest honour and
deference, frequently requesting m
views on such subjects as †.
Representation of the People of
India, the National Congress, and
so forth; upon which, being now
Fº reassured and at my ease
discoursed with facundity, an
Wii did loudly extol the intellectual
capacity of the Bengalis, as evinced
by marvellous success in passing
most difficult exams., and de-
nouncing it as a crying injustice
and beastly shame that fullest
political powers should not be con-
ceded to them, and that they
should not be eligible for all civil
appointments part passu, or even
in priority to Englishmen.
herein his Honor did warmly
agree, assuring me with *::::
benignancy of the pleasure wi
which he would hear of my appoint-
ment to be Head of a District
GRISH, CHUNDER Df, Esq., M.A., had distinguished himself splen-
didly (according to the printed testimony of Hon'ble KIPLING) in
such a post of danger. - -
I replied, that I was not passionately in love with personal danger,
and that in my case cedant arma togae, and my tongue was mightier
than my sword, but that there was no doubt that we Bengalis were
intellectually competent to govern the whole country, provided only
that we were backed up from behind by a large English military
force to uphold our authority, as otherwise we should, soon be the
pretty pickles, owing to brutal violence from Sikhs, Rajputs,
Maraºhas, and similar uncivilised coarse races. -
And Sir CHETwynn expressed his lively satisfaction that I appre-
ciated some of the advantages of the British occupation.
Thus, through my presence of mind in boldly grap.ling with the
nettle, Iturned what might have bean a disaster into a conspicuous
triumph, for all the company, ...t the favour I was in with such a
big wig as Hon’ble, CUMMERBUND, listened to me with spell-bound
enchantment, especially my friend HowARD's sprightly young sister,
a damsel of distinguished personal attractiveness, who was seated on
my other side. Her birth-name is Louisa-GwenDoIFN ; but her
family and intimates, so she did inform me, call her “WEE-WEE.”
Of the dinner itself I can speak highly, as being inexpressibly
superior, both in stylishness of service and for the quality of the

DICKENS'S DOMBEY AND SARDOU'S SARA,
SIR,-Last week your critic gave a brief notice of SARA BERNBARDT
in La Tosca. Every one conversant with the play remembers the great
situation when La Tosca clutches up the knife from the supper-table
and confronts her would-be lover, the “bold bad man,” chief of the
police, with the cruel smile and the lustful eyes. appening, by
merest accident, to take down from a book-shelf CHARLEs DICKENs's
Dombey and Son, what do I find in the scene between Edith
Dombey and Carker of the gleaming teeth? This:-
“He was coming gaily towards her, when, in an instant, she caught the
knife up from the table, and started one pace back.”
The exact situation in La Tosca. Only—Edith did not stab
Carker. SARDou went a step farther than DICKENs, and made the
hit dramatically. But as “Todgers's could do it when it liked,” so
1) ICKENs, when going in for melodrama, could come out uncommonly
strong, and did so, too.
By the way,.. let any one who comes across this note refer to
that chapter (it is the twenty-fourth, in the second volume), and,
after noting how carefully the supper for two had been prepared, let
him wonder, who, ate it?... Edith didn't; Carker, didn't. Did
Dombey, arriving late, get it? Qr did the waiters collar it, by way
of perquisites, next .# ? Also, who paid for it?
ut genius is above details. Šimply we come back to the situation
where Edith Dombey is the forerunner of La Tosca, as we seeit played
by SARA SIDDONs BERNHARDT. Yours, JoE BAGSTOCK.

HENLEY REGATTA IN 1900 A.D.
[“The foreign entries at Henley are more numerous than ever.”—Daily
Paper.]
THE usually quiet little Oxfordshire town of Henley has been the
scene of some regrettable, disturbances resulting in a loss of life,
which it is, at the present time, impossible to compute. At the
moment of sending this despatch, comparative peace has been re-
stored, owing to the presence of two
infantry regiments and one of cavalry,
together with a battery of artillery.
These have occupied the training
quarters of the crews, while detach-
ments are constantly patrolling the
s principal streets. Further reinforce-
ments have just been sent for at the
º urgent request of the Mayor of Henley,
2"> who waited on the Colonel commandin
- with a bandage over his right eye an
his arm in a sling. These injuries were
--- " received by him in the courageous exe-
--- * cution of his duty as chief magistrate
of the town. The stewards of the Regatta, those of them, that is
to say, who survive, are in permanent session in the Town Hall,
the ºut of which have been strengthened by sand-bags, while a
guard of 500 picked men is disposed in and about the building.
It is difficult in the excited state of public feeling to arrive at the
exact truth of what happened. It seems, however, that in the first
heat of the Grand Challenge Cup for Eights, the Matabele Argonauts
(with the Bucks station) were drawn against the Sons of the Nile
from the Soudan. In the second heat the Qjibbeway Leanders
were to compete against the lately formed Eskimo Boat Club.
Owing, however, to some mistake, arising, probably, from a defective
knowledge of English, the Ojibbeways came to the post in the first
heat, and insisted on starting. The Matabele oarsmen and the Sons
of the Nile, naturally enough, protested, and their protest was
backed by the Umpire, who ordered the Red Indians off the course.
They refused to move, and their stroke, Sw1NGING BUFFALo, in a
moment of intense irritation, clambered out of his racing ship on to
the launch, and, before the horrified spectators could realise what
was happening, he had scalped Mr. FRANK WILLAN, and was waving
his bloody trophy frantically in the air. Directly afterwards he fell
pierced to the heart by a well directed assegai, hurled by the arm o
OOMATOFLopogas, the coxswain of the Matabele Eight. In a moment
all was confusion and carnage. The spectators on the banks and in
the water took º the quarrel, and a hideous scene of promiscuous
massacre ensued. The air -
became black with the "I LN-N

the number of three hundred and sixty-two have already been taken

to note that on this occasion Russians, Germans, Frenchmen, Italians,

national rivalries, and fought side by side in defence of law and order.
The incident has, unfortunately, rendered it necessary to cancel the
Regatta fixture, and all entrance-fees will be returned to the captains
of crews, or to their executors and administrators.

What has the Secretary of State for India to
do with the Education Bill? "My dear
GEORGE,” said Prince ARTHUR, when I put it
to him, "you see, we must be consistent. We
brought the Indian troops to the Soudan, and
on same principle we bring Secretary of State
for India to relief of Elucation Bill muddle.’”

tion was delivered from Ministerial Benches

HOW SHOULD A LADY ALIGHT FROM A
BIKE?
THE Westminster Budget, after giving some
doggerel lines instructing ladies how to mount
eir bicycles gracefull º !), asks, “Will
some other rhymster .# em'how to get of
their machines gracefully?” Why, certainly!
To quit the wheel with perfect grace,
Your trotters on the #: 06;
See that your lover is aro
To save from impact with the ground.
Then §§ without fuss,
Deprive the bike of impetus.
Your hands then quit the handle-bar,
(Too dainty for its grip by far.)
Then feel your feet, until you see,
Quite close, the not impossible He.
Then, without haste, or jerk, or fright,
Fall in his arms.' He'll hold you tight!
Then vow, when the dismounting's o'er,
WYNDHAM's friends resent this asl to
A WILD AUTUMN;
Or, Sport versus Party.
[“The graceless Member of Parliament says t
his clerical friends and supporters:—“I am ver:
sorry, but you must go on with the intolerabl
strain, for an Autumn Session is to me an into
lerable strain. Grouse in August, partridges in
September, pheasants in October, then foxes, and
then we shall be very well disposed to consider the
Clergy, the Voluntary Schools, and the Children.’
We are in for a wild autumn.”—Mr. John Morley
at Manchester.]

On Behalf of the Elizabeth Rundle-Charles
Memorial.
[Mrs. ElizaBETH RUNDLE-CHARLEs, the much-
esteemed authoress of that fine book, Yº sºon.
berg-Gotha Family, took a deep interest in the
North London Hospital for Consumption. As a
fitting memorial to an excellent writer and most
charitable lady, it is proposed to endow in that
hospital “The Elizabeth Rundle-Charles Bed,” thus
at once honouring her, and “forwarding the work
so dear to her heart.”]
A GENTLE lady and her generous task
Honour : help at once! And who could
Pleasanter double duty?
Her life was like her books, divinely moved
To service of the two high things she loved,
Her words spake to the world, but those sick
Wards
Best knew her work, which [also was her
Lord's,
Unselfish help and healing. -
The sick, the suffering, the fate-stricken
poor,
Will see that sympathetic smile no more
Through grief's grey shadows stealing.
Punch asks his friends to help perpetuate
The light of a life's labour, dedicate
To heaven and to humanity.
Let this Memorial be the public care,
In honour of true heart and talent rare,
For these things are not vanity!

EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, June 15 – Tout est perdu, fors–
les vacances,” said the Member for Sark, dropping into the tongue
still spoken among his constituents. -
That certainly seems to be result of Session at epoch reached by
PRINCE ARTHUR's speech to-day. Been great meeting of, Party at
Foreign Office, Summons by Ministry of day to their followers to
come and talk matters over has ever bean the last resource of noble
minds. To-day's proceedings supply no variation to rule: Matters
in Commons reached muddle out of which there is no issue with
programme as it stands, cum determination to adjourn in time for

performance of pledge
involves breaking up of
Education Bill also, and
total abandonment of
other measures, so much
the worse for them.
Thusitcomes to pass, as
SARK says, all is lost
save the holiday.
PRINCE ARTHUR has
pretty way of fronting
exceptional expectation
with countenance and
manner of preterna-
tural unconsciousness.
Of course, everybody
(especially those who
were not present) knew

his a pretty piece ºf acting, though not easy to see why it should
have been thought necessary or appropriate to occasion. Better still
a couple of hours later, when John, o' GoRST, leader in the Educa-
tion Bill tandem, turned round, and ominously pricked up his ears
under nose of driver on box seat. Last Thursday PRINCE ARTHUR
threw over GoRST on important amendment of Education Bill.
GoRST, as Minister in º: of *... Rolling-STONE
Ro1.LIT's proposal to add the Councils of º of 20,000 inhabit-
ants to number of local authorities created by Bill. PRINCE ARTHUR,
blandly observing that .# of argument was in favour of Amend-
ment, straightway accepted it. -
John o' GoRST said nothing then, but to-night took it out of his
esteemed Leader. Only thing needed for completion of scene was
presence in Peers' Gallery of GRAND CRoss. June seems to be the
month when John o' GoRST lets himself go. It was in June, 1891,
he delivered the famous Manipur speech, the most exquisite and
boldest piece of irony ever spoken in the Commons. To-night he
out-manipured Manipur. PRINCE ARTHUR not in his place when
what SquEE of MALwoop wittily called the boomerang was let {{;
Pale scouts went in search of him. As he walked in, he could 9
#. what had happened. There sat the Opposition, quizzical,
arious, closely watching. PRINCE ARTHUR strolled to his place,
with just the slightest flush on his fair cheek, with carefully manifest
attempt to suppress a yawn, with general air suggesting that if he
were at the trouble to address the Chairman he would observe, “Dear
me, Mr. LowTHER, don't you find it ºvely hot?”
Business done.—The Education Bill's.

with murderous fire that nearly blew John o' GoRST into arms of
PRINCE ARTHUR. . In times of peace, when the Major makes his
helmet a hive for bees, he is a wharfinger and bonded warehouse-
man, of Mark Lane and Wººf, Even when in mufti, military
strategy, instinctive with him. Thus to-night, thermometer being
77° in the shade, he thoughtfully denuded of the letter “h” all
words which, according to common practice, give it precidence in
their orthography.
“I’ope Sir John,” said the Major, mopping his glistening fire-
head, “won't leave West’Am out in the cold.” -
West Ham is all very well for a Winter Session; in these
tropical days West'Am is distinctly more agreeable. Just #.
ing dinner hour. Whether .# or not, Major's way of putting
it suggested all a sensible man would care for dinner on such a night.
A slice of cold'am, a crusty roll of bread, and a pint of Pommery,
not too much iced, but iced enough.
That an idle fancy born of approach to eight o'clock. The Major
thinking of something much more important than dinner. Is con-
cerned for the interests of forty thousand school children, in a great
constituency that knew a good man when they methim on a wharfor in
a bonded warehouse, Soplaced Major at head of poll without his going
out of way to solicit yote. That was what nerved the Major to raise
flag of revolt against his own leaders. A fine figure he presented as he
stood on back bench below gangway, his white waistcoat gleaming
in the gathering twilight, his face flushed with honest emotion, his
left hand in his pocket, his right beating the air with copy of the
Orders of the Day, tightly rolled #. sy as to represent the linstock
of the gun he had just fired off at Education Bill.
“I want to see Voluntary Schools assisted,” said the Major, “but
don't want to see Board Schools degraded. We all know where the
evil influence at the bottom of this business comes from. It comes
from the Church,” he added, feeling in his trowser ket for
another cartridge. “The Government has got very bad advisers.
The Clergy are not men of business—never were. they come on
º: I push them off.” Here a vigorous wave of the linstock
which had, early in the oration, cleared the space within range of its
movement, Members preferring to watch the actiºn from safe
distance.
Business done.-Education Bill having bad time.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, June 15 - Tout est perdu, fore-
les vacances,” said the Member for Sark, dropping into the tongue
still spoken among his constituents. -
That certainly seems to be result of Session at epoch reached by
PRINCE ARTHUR's speech to-day. Been great meeting of, Party at
Foreign Office, Summons by Ministry of day to their followers, to
come and talk matters over has ever bean the last resource of noble
minds. To-day's proceedings supply no variation to rule; Matters
in Commons reached muddle out of which there is no issue with
programme as it stands, cum determination to adjourn in time for
grouse. PRINCE AR-
Thub feels himself per-
- sonally and directly
- pledged to break up
school on or about the
12th of August. If
performance of pledge
involves breaking up of
Education Bill also, and
total abandonment of
other measures, so much
the worse for them.
Thusitcomes to pass, as
SARK says, all is lost
save the holiday.
PRINCE ARTHUR has
pretty way of fronting
exceptional expectation
with countenance and
tural unconsciousness.
Of course, everybody
(especially those who
were not present) knew
all about Foreign Office
meeting. House
crowded in anticipation
of what the Leader
would say thereament

with air of puzzled interest. What could he mean? After moment's
pause, he rose and mentioned, ſº incidentally, that whole arrange-
ments of Session were remºdelled. Would go on for further fort-
night in Committee on Education Bill; would then hang it up
to dry till January; would proceeed to pick up any crumbs of
legislation that might have fallen from the table; would in any case
adjourn for holidays about middle of August. -
his a pretty piece cf acting, though not easy to see why it should
have been thought necessary or appropriate to occasion. Better still
a ; of hours later, when John o' GoRST, leader in the Educa-
tion Bill tandem, turned round, and ominously pricked up his ears
under nose of driver on box seat. Last Thursday PRINCE ARTHUR
threw over GoRST on important amendment of Education Bill.
GoRST, as Minister in charge of, Bill, resisted Rolling-STONE
Rollit's proposal to add the Councils of boroughs of 20,000 inhabit-
ants to number of local authorities created by Bill. PRINCE ARTHUR,
blandly observing that weight of argument was in favour of Amend-
ment, straightway accepted it.
John o' GoRST said nothing then, but to-night took it out of his
esteemed Leader. Only thing needed for completion of scene was
presence in Peers' Gallery of GRAND CRoss. June seems to be the
month when John o' GoRST lets himself go. It was in June, 1891
he delivered the famous Manipur speech, the most exquisite and
boldest piece of irony ever spoken in the Commons. To-night he
out-manipured Manipur. PRINCE ARTHUR not in his place when
what Squire of MALwoop wittily called the boomerang was let fly.
Pale scouts went in search of him. As he walked in, he could 9

#.ious, closely watching. PRINCE ARTHUR strolled to his place,
with just the slightest flush on his fair cheek, with carefully manifest
attempt to suppress a yawn, with general air suggesting that if he
were at the trouble to address the Chairman he would observe, “Dear
me, Mr. LowTHER, don't you find it ºvely hot P”

“I’ope Sir John,” said the Major, mopping his glistening fire-
head, “won't leave West’Am out in the cold.”
West Ham is all very well for a Winter Session; in these
tropical days West'Am is distinctly more agreeable. Just approach-
ing dinner hour. Whether designedly or not, Major's way of putting
it suggested all a sensible man would care for dinner on such a night.
A slice of cold'am, a crusty roll of bread, and a pint of Pommery,
not too much iced, but iced enough.
That an idle fancy born of approach to eight o'clock. The Major
thinking of something much more important than dinner. Is con-
cerned for the interests of forty thousand school children, in a great
constituency that knew a good man when they methimon a wharfor in
a bonded warehouse. So placed Major at head of poll without his going
out of way to solicit yote. That was what nerved the Major to raise
flag of revolt against his own leaders. A fine figure he presented as he
stood on back bench below gangway, his white waistcoat gleaming
in the gathering twilight, his face flashed with honest emotion, his
left hand in his pocket, his right beating the air with copy of the
Orders of the Day, tightly rolled #. so as to represent the linstock
of the gun he had just fired off at Education Bill,
“I want to see Voluntary Schools assisted,” said the Major, “but
don't want to sse Board Schools degraded. We all know where the
evil influence at the bottom of this business comes from. It comes
from the Church,”, he added, feeling in his trowser ket for
another cartridge. “The Government has got very bad advisers.

GEORGE,” said Prince ARTHUR, when I put it
to him, “you see, we must be consistent. We
brought the Indian troops to the Soudan, and
on same principle we bring Secretary of State
for India to relief of Eiucation Bill muddle.’”

John KENNAway. If he turns and rends the

in with bottle º in one hand, and sample

FRID Lawson says, if he'd only a flask of
brandy inbreastcoat-pocket, and some crushed
ice in neighbourh of his coat-tails, we
might make a night of it.
George, it seems, has some friends in the

ginger-beer and similar recondite refresh-
ment. WYNDHAM's friends resent this asl to

Then vow, when the dismounting's o'er,

Or, Sport versus Party.

his clerical friends and supporters:-"I am very
sorry, but you must go on with the intolerable
strain, for an Autumn Session is to me an into-

September, pheasants in October, then foxes, and

What has the Secretary of State for India to
do with the Education Bill? “My dear
GEORGE,” said Prince ARTHUR, when I put it
to him, “you see, we must be consistent. We
brought the Indian troops to the Soudan, and
on same principle we bring Secretary of State
for India to relief of Elucation Bill muddle.’”
KENNAway's speech that made such sensa-
tion was delivered from Ministerial Benches
dead against Education Bill., That's why
Opposition shout and throw up their caps...No
more esteemed man on Conservative side than
John KENNAWAY. If he turns and rends the
Ministerial Bill, its case seems hopeless. So
SquEEE OF MALwood and HENRY FowleR
take the burly baronet in hand, and rub him
in, as it were, on PRINCE ARTHUR, who, as
usual when the music louder, has been
§º back to face it from the Treasury
Bench.
Business done. — A lively night in Com-
mittee on Education Bill, John Kºnnaway
mutinies under command of Major BANES.
Friday.-After week's fitful fever, House
sleeps well in Committee of Supply on Army
Estimates. Quite refreshing this thirsty
weather to have GEORGE WYNDHAM coming

FRID LAwson says, if he'd only a flask of
brandy in breastcoat-pocket, and some crushed
ice in neighbourh of his coat-tails, we
might make a night of it.
George, it seems, has some friends in the
mineral water way. In certain canteens at
anxious to avoid giving Satan a change, have
occupied otherwise, idle hands, in brewing
ginger-beer and similar recondite refresh-
ment. WYNDHAM's friends resent this as
interfering with business. BRODRICK ex-
plains that Secretary of State for War has
spent restless nights in thinking matter oyer.

HOW SHOULD A LADY ALIGHT FROM A
BIKE?
THE Westminster Budget, after giving some
doggerel lines instructing ladies how to mount
their bicycles gracefull º !), asks, “Will
some other rhymster º em"how to get of
their machines gracefully?” Why, certainly!
To quit the wheel with perfect grace,
Your trotters on the #: lace;
See that your lover is aroun
To save from impact with the ground.
Then § without fuss,
Deprive the bike of impetus.
Your hands then quit the handle-bar.
(Too dainty for its grip by far.)
Then feel your feet, until you see,
Quite close, the not impossible He.
Then, without haste, or jerk, or fright,
Fall in his arms / He'll hold you tight!
Then vow, when the dismounting's o'er,
(To Barber.) HERE's h
A WILD AUTUMN;
Or, Sport versus Party.
[“The graceless Member of Parliament says to
his clerical friends and supporters:—"I am very
sorry, but you must go on with the intolerable
strain, for an Autumn Session is to me an into-
lerable strain. Grouse in August, partridges in
September, pheasants in October, then foxes, and
then we shall be very well disposed to consider the
Clergy, the Woluntary Schools, and the Children.’
We are in for a wild autumn.”—Mr. John Morley

HOW SHOULD A LADY ALIGHT FROM A

THE Westminster Budget, after giving some
doggerel lines instructing ladies how to mount
their bicycles {...ſº º !), asks, “Will
some other rhymster em"how to get of
their machines gracefully?” Why, certainly!
To quit the wheel with perfect grace,
Your trotters on the ce;
See that your lover is aroun
To save from impact with the ground.
Then § without fuss,
Deprive the bike of impetus.
Your hands then quit the handle-bar.
(Too dainty for its grip by far.)
Then feel your feet, until you see,
Quite close, the not impossible He.
Then, without haste, or jerk, or fright,
Fall in his arms.' He'll hold you tight!
Then vow, when the dismounting's o'er,
WYNDHAM's friends resent this asl to
A WILD AUTUMN;
Or, Sport versus Party.
[“The graceless Member of Parliament says to
his clerical friends and supporters:—“I am very
sorry, but you must go on with the intolerable
strain, for an Autumn Session is to me an into-
lerable strain. Grouse in August, partridges in
September, pheasants in October, then foxes, and
then we shall be very well disposed to consider the
Clergy, the Voluntary Schools, and the Children.’
We are in for a wild autumn.”—Mr. John Morley
at Manchester.]
Sporting Patriot loquitur:-
WELL, what is there here that's affronting *
Just fancy the folly of shunting,
For parsons and schools
(They must fancy us fools), .
The pleasures of shooting and hunting !
That were a “wild autumn,” by Jingo!
When T. is the only true stingo
Twere mighty absurd
To miss barrel and bird -
For the sake of—John MoRLEY's stale lingol
The parsons are all very Fº
To plump Mother Church's lean coffer,
And smash the School Board,
Summer days I’ll afford,
But Autumn I really can't offerl
We cannot go shooting by proxies!
