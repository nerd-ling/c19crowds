T was New Year's Eve once again; the clock in Mr. PUNCH's sanctum was fast “ticking out the little life” of the Year
of Grace One Thousand Eight Hundred and Ninety-Six. Big Ben was within measurable distance of announcing, in
his sonorous, superhuman-toast-master fashion, the advent of 'Ninety-Seven, as who should shout over the silent city
roofs and towers, “My Lords, Ladies and Gemtlemen, pray silence for your noble guest, the New Year !”—Mr. PUNCH,
alone, save for his inseparable Toby, was loyally engaged in concocting a steaming bumper in which to drink the health of
that coming guest, associating it with the honoured name of his well-beloved Sovereign Lady Queen VICTORIA, whose
counterfeit presentment, in the sixtieth year of her glorious reign, stood in the place of honour before him.
“Sixty years!” mused England's Mentor. “And what years | Her Gracious Majesty eclipses all predecessors,
cuts all records, distances all competitors on—not the cinder-path, but that truly royal road, the path of glory !!”
“—in our rough island story
The path of Duty is the way to Glory,”
sounded a high, if rather harsh-toned voice at PUNCH's elbow. Mr. PUNCH bowed gracefully to the high-nosed, stiff.
stomachered, plenteously be-ruffed Tudor Titaness, whom he thus bespoke:–
“Your own unofficial but immortal Laureate, the divine WILLIAM, could hardly have beaten our own ALFRED the
Great—TENNyson, bien entendu !—in prettily turning a patriotic sentiment. Nor could
The spacious times of great ELIZABETH
surpass in splendour and marvel the astonishing era of Her who doth indeed
—hold
A nobler office upon earth
Than arms, or power of brain, or birth,
Could give the warrior kings (or queens) of old.”
“He is right, BEss!" said a smaller but solid and homely-stately figure at the Tudor's side. “Her record beats
even ours, as haughty SARAH herself would perforce admit, her mighty MARLBoRough notwithstanding. Do you know me,
Mr. PUNCH 2"
“‘Thou, great ANNA,' as one poet called thee, art fitting companion for the “great Elizabeth' of another,” quoted
Mr. PUNCH, politely and pertinently.
“Mnemonic miracle !” murmured the Virgin Queen. “Gallant as LEicester, courteous as RALEigh, sage as
Cecil' Beshrew me, ’tis verily no wonder our Cousin Victoria hath, in her sixty years of sway, surpassed mine in

power and ANNA's in splendour, since she hath had you as her contemporary and counsellor l’”

“The year 1896-7,” said Mr. Pusch, “must be more of an annus mirabilis than even that ‘Year of Wonders, 1366,'
so thrasonically glorified by ‘Glorious John,' though then DRYDEN hyperbolically declared that
- —all was Britain the wide ocean saw.”
“Time hath favoured the third of England's triad of great Queens,” said Elizabeth. “Sixty years! I was
allotted but forty-five, and ANNA here only a poor twelve. The Third HENRY merely touched fifty-six, and even the Third
| George, with his bare sixty, fell short-how far is on the knees of the gods’—of your happy VICTORIA, of whom, as
her great Laureate aptly said— -
A thousand claims to reverence closed
In her as Mother, Wife, and Queen.
I was never the two former, alas!" sighed the Valorous Virgin of the West, pensively; “but,” drawing herself stiffly up,
“by the splendour of heaven, I was the latter!”
“‘Who deniges of it, BETsy'—I mean BEss?" said Mr. PUNCH, slily.
The haughty Tudor bridled, scowled, muttered something about traitors and the Tower, and seemed about to explode
| upon Mr. Pusch as though he were a mere recalcitrant LEIcFstER, when “Great ANNA" whispered something in her royal
ear, and that verjuicy virginal face broke up into a genial smile.
“ANNA bids me ask you ‘What the Dickens you mean?'" she chuckled. “Whatever my demerits, Mr. Punch, you
can hardly call me a Prig ' Yet, for the sake of the Season, and its great celebrator CHARLEs—another glory of the Victorian
Era—I'll forgive you.”
The two Queens gazed admiringly at Mr. PUNCH's presentment of the Third, still happily reigning.
“She hath no SHAKSPEARE to illume her stage, and render eternally illustrious her annals,” murmured the Tudor,
turning tenderly the leaves of a Book of Plays in her royal hand.
“Nor hath she been called ‘AugustA'—as I was,” said ANNA, caressing her Spectator affec ionately.
“No 1" admitted their host, cheerfully. “But our well-beloved liege Lady hath had that which neither of you was
blessed with, which SHARspeARE would have extolled and ADDIsos admired.”
“Beshrew me, what may that be?" cried the startled Virgin Queen.
Mr. Pusch stooped to pat Toby, and to hide his mantling blush. “On their own merits modest men are dumb," he
quoted pointedly.
“Marry come up! what meaneth the man?” began Queen Bess, when ANNA again whispered in her ear, and
again her somewhat shrewish features relaxed into a smile.
“I suppose you are right, now as always, Mr. PUNCH,” she replied. “But, O great Victorian Sage and Scientist,
Patriot and Pictor, Champion and Councillor, Pundit, Poet and Wit, have you. not a homely proverb to the effect that “the
proof of the pudding is in the eating '2"
“Precisely " responded Mr. Pusch, with electric promptitude. “And that is why, to save time, to spare me
uncongenial self-assertion, to illustrate to you the matchless glories and graces of our Victoria's Sixty Years' Record, to make
you love and admire your sister Queen as much—if possible—as I and all my countrymen do; and, finally, to give you both a
good time when you get back to the Shades, and tire occasionally even of days and nights spent with SHAKSPEARE and
Addison, I hand you, as the neatest of New Year's Gifts, my

Soray I was unable to attend the Irish Tourist Association.
However, they are sure to be pleased to hear that “not having
been able to make other satisfactory arrangements I have de-
çided to try the experiment of taking the hotel at (suppress place,
for fear it might be thought I was attempting to obtain a free
advertisement) into my own hands, and hope that in this way
I may be able to promote in some degree one of the objects of
the Society.”
Of course “one of the objects” is to make travellers in Erin
comfortable at their inns. Shall call mine the O'Hartington.
Nothing like a little local colouring. Now that is all right
must get myself up as ideal Irish hotel-keeper. Own toggery
will do, I think, with a pipe in my white hat, and a red waist-
coat (like the late D10N Boucicault in the Colleen Bawn), just to
give the necessary Hibernian flavour.
Must be ready to receive my guests at the door of my hostelrie.
No reason why I should not have an arm-chair. Got one with
plenty of cushions. Made myself additionally comfortable by
resting my feet on a foot-stool. Now prepared for all emer-
gencies.
Ah, here come a party of tourists. Take off my hat and wave
my hand. Fortunately no ladies, so need not get up. Feel
every inch a landlord, but, after all, rather hate superfluous
exertion.
“Have I got any rooms?’” Why, to be sure I have. Must
ask, one of my waiters. They are all good fellows. Sure to
know all about it. Call for Pat. One of my fellows must be
called Pat. “Pat,” national name.
My guest rather unreasonable. Wants to know “why I don't
get up and take his carpet bag.” Of course would be only too
pleased, but it looks rather a heavy one, and some other fellow
could take it just as well as I could. Most likely better. Dare
say I could drag about a heavy portmanteau; but don't know.
In point of fact have never tried.
“Why don’t I look sharp P” -
Now I really think that isn't complimentary. Implies that I
appear to be inactive. True I_generally sit with my hands in

Perfectly simple and easy attitude. Calculated to give fullest

chance for the mind. Intellect can be uncommonly energetic

Why, of course. Let them have them, by all means.
They say, “That its all very well to put them off like that,
but if I am the landlord of the hotel I ought to behave as such.”
Argue with them. . What’s the use of a row. If they will ask
Pat or some other fellow they shall have anything they please.
Only don't bother me. Such nonsense.
They say “they have asked Pat to get them the looking-glass
and the curtains; but he knows nothing about them, and re-
ferred them to me.”
Fancy Pat must be rather scanty of resource. However,
suppose I must come to the rescue. “Tourists had better order
looking-glass and curtains from some local universal provider.”
Probably some O'Whiteley in the neighbourhood. By all means

JOTTINGS AND TITTLINGS.
(By BABoo HuRRY BUNGsHo JABBERJEE, B.A.)
No. XVI.
Mr. Jabberjee makes a pilgrimage to the Shrine of Shakspeare.
I Havº frequently spoken in the flattering terms of a eulogium
concerning my extreme partiality for the writings of Hon’ble
WILLIAM SHAKseraRE. It has been remarked, with some correct-
ness, that he did not exist for an age, but all the time; and
though it is the open question whether he did not derive all his
ideas from previous writers, and even, whether he wrote so
much as a single line of the plays which are attributed to his
“It was here,” I said, reverently, “that the Swan of Avon was hatched: ”
inspired nib, he is one of the institutions of the country, and it
is the correct thing for every orthodox British subject to ad-
mire and understand him even when most incomprehensible.
. Consequently I did cock-a-hoop for joy on receiving an invita-
tion from my friend, ALLBUTT-INNETT, Jun., Esq., on behalf of
his parents, that I should accompany them on an excursion by
rail to Stratford-upon-Avon, where the said poet had his domi-
cile of origin. -:
And so great was my enthusiasm that, during the journey, I
declaimed, ore rotundo, certain select passages from his works
which I had committed to memory during the salad days of my
schoolboyishness, and with such effect that Miss WEE-wº ALL-
nurt-INNETT. (who is excessively, emotional) was compelled, at
times, to yeil her countenance in the recesses of a pocket-
handkerchief.
Having at º arrived at that hallowed and sacred spot, the
very namo of w
every educated bosom, our first proceeding was to partake
ch sends a sweet and responsive thrill §ºf
or a
-
some suitable quotation from
This repast we ordered at an old-fashioned hostelry, whose
doorway was decerated by a counterfeit persentment of the
Bard, and I observed that similar effigies were placed above
several of the shops as I walked along the streets. These images
somewhat resemble those erected to Buddha in certain parts of
India, being similarly bald, but terminating—not in crossed
legs, but a cushion ºith taseis. However, f was not able to
ğiscover that, it is the custom for even the most ignorant in-
habitants to do anything in the nature of a poojah before these
figures º longer, though probably usual enough before CRox-
well, with theiron sides, ordered all such baubles to be removed.
in a hole in the upper wall of the Town Hall there is a life-size
statuary of SHAKSPRARE, with legs complete, showing that he
was not actually deficient in such extremities and a mere gifted
torso; and it is presumable that the reason why only his upper
portions are generally represented is, that marble in these parts
is too precious a commodity to be wasted on superfluities.
We visited the church, and saw his tomb, and there again was
the superior half of him occupied with writing verses on a
cushion in a mural niche, supported by pillars. Upon a slab
below is inscribed a verse requesting that his dust should not
be digged, and cursing him who should interfere with his bones,
but in so mediocre a style, and of such indifferent orthography,
that it is considered by some to be a sort of spurious crypto-
gram composed by Hon'ble BAcon.
On such a verata quaestio I am not to give a decided opinion,
though the verse, as a literary composition, is hardly up to the
level of Hamlet, and it would perhaps have been preferable if
the poet, instead of attempting an impromptu, had looked out
is earlier works. For, when an
author is occupied in shuffling off his mortal coil, it is unreason-
able to expect him to produce poetry that is up to the mark.
When I advanced this excuse aloud in the church, a party of
Americans within hearing exclaimed, ... that such
irreverent levity was a scandal in a spot which was the Mecca of
the entire civilized universe.
Whereupon I did protest earnestly that I meant no irreverence,
being nulli secundus in respect for the Genius Loci, only, as a
critic of English Literature, I could not help regretting that a
poet gifted with every requisite for º: a satisfactory
jºš had produced a doggerel which was undeniably below
his usual par. -
This rendered them of an increased ferocity, until Mr. ALL-
Butt-INNETT good naturedly took them into a corner and whis-
pered that I was a very wealthy young Indian Prince, of t
scholastic attainments, but oppressed by an uncontrollable
naïveté, after which they all came and shook me by the hand,
saying they were very proud to have met me.
Afterwards we proceeded to the Birthplace, where a very
entlewomanly female exhibited the º: in which, the
nfant Bard first saw the light. Alack! there was but little light
to behold, being a shockingly low and dingy, room, meagrely
furnished with two chairs and a table, on which was another of
the busts. As I came in, I uttered a remark which I had pre-
pared for the occasion. “It was here,” I said, reverently, “here
that the Swan of Avon was hatched!” At which Miss WEE-WEE
was again overcome by emotion. - -
The room was greatly in the necessity of whitewash, being
black with smoke and signatures in lead pencil. Even the win-
dow-panes were scratched all over by diamonds, on, seeing which,
and being also the possessor of a diamond and gold ring, I was
about to inscribe my own name, but was prevented by the lady
custodian. - -
I indignantly and eloquently protested that if Hon’ble Sirs,
WALTER'Scott, Lord Byron, Isaac WAITON, WASHINGTON, Iº
ving and Co. were permitted to deface the glass thus, surely I,
who was a uate of Calcutta University, and a valuable con-
tributor to London Punch, was equally entitled, since what was
sauce for a goose was sauce for a gander, and Mrs. ALLANTT:
INNETT irºš that I was a distinguished Skakesperian student
and indian prince, but the custodian responded that she couldn't
help that, for it was ultra vires, nevertheless.
However, while she was engaged in pointing out the spot
away,
where somebody's signature had been before it was peeled
f, snatching the opportunity behind her back, did triumphantly
inscribe my autograph on the bust's nose.
In the back-room they showed us where SHAKsprank's father
stapled his wool, which caused Mrs. ALLBUTT-INNETT to remark
that she had always understood that the poet was of quite humble
origin, and that, for her part, she thought,it was all the more
creditable to him to have d. what he did do.

upon Mr. PUNCH as though he were a mere rec ilcitrant LEICFSTEH, when " Great ANNA "' whispered something in her royal
ear, and that verjuicy virginal face broke up into a genial smile.
"ANNA bids me ask you ' What the Dickens you mean ?' " she chuckled. "Whatever my dcmîrits, Mr. PUNCH, you
can hardly cill me a Prig! Yet, for the sake of the Season, and its great celebrator CHARLES—another glory of the Victorian
Era—1 '11 forgive you."
The two Queens gazed admiringly at Mr. PUNCH'S presentment of the Third, still happily reigning.
"She hath no SHAKSPEARE to illume her stage, and render eternally illustrious har annals," murmured the Tudor,
turning tenderly the leaves of a Book of Plays in her royal hand.
"Nor hath she been called ' AUGUSTA '—as / was," said ANNA, caressing her Spectator affeoionately.
"No !" admitted their host, cheerfully. "But our well-belovel liege Lady hath had that which neither of you was
blessed with, which SIIAKSPBARE would have extolled and ADDISON admired."
"Beshrew me, what may thai be ?" cried the startled Virgin Queen.
Mr. PUNCH stooped to pat TOBY,—and to hide his mantling blush. "On their own merits modest men are dumb," he
quoted pointedly.
"Мнггу come up! what meaneth the man?" began Queen BES«, when ANNA again whispered in her ear, and
again her somewhat shrewish features relaxed into a smile.
"1 suppose you are right, now as always, Mr. PUNCH," she replied. "But, 0 great Victorian Sage and Scientist,
Patriot and Pictor, Champion and Councillor, Pundit, Poet and Wit, have you. not a homely proverb to the effect that ' the
proof of the pudding is in the eating '?"
"Pncisely! " responded Mr. PUSCH, with electric promptitude. "And that is why, to save time, to spare me
uncongenial self-assertion, to illustrate to you the matchless glories and graces of our VICTORIA'S Sixty Years' Record, to make
you love and admire your sister Queen as much—if possible—as I and all my countrymen do; and, finally, to give you both a

PRO BONO PUBLICO.
(Page from Uic purely Imaginary Diary a/a Л'оЫе Licensed yietvalkr.)
SOKBY I was unable to attend the Irish Tourist Association.
However, they are sure to be pleased to hear that "not having
been able to make other satisfactory arrangements I have de-
cided to try the experiment of taking the hotel at (suppress place,
for fear it might be thought I was attempting to obtain a free
advertisement) into my own hands, and hope that in this way
I may be able to promote in some degree one of the objects of
the Society."
Of course "one of the objects" is to make travellers in Erin
comfortable at their inns. Shall call mine the O'Hartington.
Nothing like a little local colouring. Now that is all right
must get myself up as ideal Irish hotel-keeper. Own toggery
will do, I think, with a pipe in my white hat, and a red waist-
coat (like the late DION BOUCICAULT in the Colleen Bawn), just to
give the necessary Hibernian flavour.
Must be ready to receive my guests at the door of my hostelrie.
No reason why I should not have an arm-chair. Got one with
plenty of cushions. Made myself additionally comfortable by
resting my feet on a foot-stool. Now prepared for all emer-
gencies.
Ah, here come a party of tourists. Take off my hat and wave
my hand. Fortunately no ladies, so need not get up. Feel
every inch a landlord, but, after all, rather hate superfluous
exertion.
"Have I got any rooms?" Why, to be sure I have. Must
ask one of my waiters. They are all good fellows. Sure to
know all about it. Call for Pat. One of my fellows must be
called Pat. "Pat," national name.
My guest rather unreasonable. Wants to know "why I don't
get up and take his carpet bag." Of course would be only too
pleased, but it looks rather a heavy one, and some other fellow
could take it just as well as I could. Most likely better. Dare
say I could drag about a heavy portmanteau; but don't know.
In point of fact have never tried.
''Why don't I look sharp?"
Now I really think that isn't complimentary. Implies that I
appear to be inactive. True I generally sit with my hands in
my pockets, with my hat tipped over my eyes. But why not?
Perfectly simple and easy attitude. Calculated to give fullest
rest to the body. And if body is not being bothered, best
chance for the mind. Intellect can bo uncommonly energetic
if body has nothing to complain of. Ah, here is Pat. 'He retiree
with the touriste. There! Now, if I hadn't taken the hotel
into my own hands, what would have become of them?
• **•*•
Suppose I must have been asleep. Hallo! Here come the
touriste. Hope they won't bother me any more.
J'They want a looking-glass, and curtains to the window."
Why, or course. Let them have them, by all means.
They say, "That its all very well to put them off like that,
but if I am the landlord of the hotel I ought to behave as such."
Argue with them. What's the use of a row. If they will ask
Pat or some other fellow they shall have anything they please.
Only don't bother me. Such nonsense.
They say "they han- asked Pat to get them the looking-glass
and the curtains; but he knows nothing about them, and re-
ferred them to me."
Fancy Pat must be rather scanty of resource. However,
suppose I must come to the rescue. "Tourists had better order
looking-glass and curtains from some local universal provider."
Probably some O'Whiteley in the neighbourhood. By all means
have what they please; but why bother me P
Thank goodness 1 They have gone. Enjoy the scenery onoe
more. Very fine. Close my eyes.
•' • • • • •
Awakened with a start. What's the matter now? Same
tourists. They say that "the steak is underdone." Well, why
shouldn't it be? Some people like steaks underdone.
They say "they don't." Well, I can't help that. Better go
and have dinner somewhere else. Know a first-rate hotel where
[ frequently feed myself. Give the address and they are off.
Capital! Shows how much better it is to take things into one's
own hands. Going to sleep again, when Pat informs me that my
guests have gone off with their luggage.
Capital! No one in my inn I Further need of waiting in the
hall unnecessary. So shall return to the House of Lords.

"THE FOLLY OF"—HICHENS.*
EUSTACE was twenty-two when he was beginning to attract at-
tention. People had begun to notice his way of walking down
Piccadilly on nis hands, and his odd habit of living entirely on
the poached eggs of plovers, together with his curious fondness
for sweeping crossings on rainy days, giving to every passer-by
who deigned to use his crossing a penny or even more, had al-
ready caused people to discuss him with a certain interest, even
a certain wonder. The medical journals mentioned him often
as a case whose peculiarities were not devoid of interest. He
affected, one season—was it, perhaps, sincere ?—to think he was
the Emperor of CHINA, and received visitors in a pig-tail and a
fan. During another season, although in excellent health, he
refused .to leave the asylum even for the ordinary exercise in the
grounds, declaring all movement, with the single exception of
flying, to be bad form, and unsuited to a gentleman. When he
paw a goose standing on its head, he declared it was a swan.
He played with air-balls a good deal at this time, and wrote
rather curious post-cards to his aunt at Putney. Over the tea-
leaves of convention he poured the hot water of originality, the
result being a curiously weak and ineffective infusion of eccentri-
city. Society loves absurdity if it is sufficiently absurd. EU-
STACE became popular. The feather of laughter waved in the
big black hat of Society. But the garden-roller of science crushed
the green hopes of London's budding grass. And EUSTACE fell
in love with WINIFRED.
He met her at a fancy ball. It was given to amuse the inmates,
and, by way of humouring them, each was allowed to wear the
costume of the person, or the object, that he imagined himself to
be. The first prize was taken by a gentleman who appeared as
a gong, and struck terror into all by striking himself at the hours
of meals. Poor EUSTACE dressed himself up as what he imagined
himself at the time—a gentleman of the nineteenth century.
In the lonely lunacy of his black coat and whit« tie he felt ill at
ease as WINIFRED gazed at him with her big brown eyes. (She
was dressed ая я bicycle.)' He looked very odd in his gloomy,

JOTTINGS AND TITTLINGS.
(Вт BABOO HURRY Виновно JABBERJEE, B.A.)
No. XVI.
Mr. Jabbcrjct makes a pilgrimage to the Shrine of Shakspeare.
I HAVE frequently spoken in the Battering terme of a eulogium
concerning my extreme partiality for the writings of Hon'ble
WILLIAM SHAKSPEABE. It has been remarked, with some correct-
nées, tha^ he did not exist for an age, but all the time; and
though it is the open question whether he did not derive all his
ideas from previous writers, and even whether he wrote so
much us a single line of the plays which are attributed to his

• It wa» here," I said, reverently, "thut the Swan of Avon was hatched!"
inspired nib, he is one of the institutions of the country, and it
is _ the correct thing for every orthodox British subject to ad-
mire and understand him even when most incomprehensible.
Consequently I did cock-a-hoop for joy on receiving an invita-
tion from my friend ALLBUTT-INNBTT, Jun., Esq., on behalf of
bis parents, that I should accompany them on an excursion by
rail to Stratford-upon-Avon, where the said poet had his domi-
cile of origin.
And so great was my enthusiasm that, during the journey, I
declaimed, ore rotundo, certain select passages from his works
which I had committed to memory during the salad days of my
schoolboyiehness, and with such effect that Miss WEB-WEB ALL-
BUTT-lNNETT^who is excessively emotional) was compelled, at
Limes, to veil her countenance in the recesses of a pocket-
handkerchief.
Having at length arrived at that hallowed and sacred spot, the
very ñamo ef which sends a sweet and responsive thrill through
every educated bosom, our first proceeding was to partake »fa
This repast we ordered at an old-fashioned hostelry, whose
doorway was decorated by a counterfeit persentment of the
Bard, and I observed that similar effigiee were placed above
several of the shops as I walked along the streets. These images
somewhat resemble those erected to Buddha in certain parts of
India, being similarly bald, but terminating—not in crossed
legs, but a cushion with tassels. However, I was not able to
discover that it is the custom for even the most ignorant in-
habitants to do anything in the nature of a poojah before these
figures any longer, though probably usual enough before CROM-
WELL, with the iron sides, ordered all such baubles to be removed.
In a hole in the upper wall of the Town Hall there is a life-size
statuary of SHAKSPKARE, with legs complete, showing that he
was not actually deficient in such extremities and a mere gifted
torso; and it is presumable that the reason why only his upper
portions are generally represented is, that marble in these parts
is too precious a commodity to be wasted on superfluities.
We visited the church, and saw his tomb, and there again was
the superior half of him occupied with writing verses on a
cushion m a mural niche, supported by pillars. Upon a slab
below is inscribed a verse requesting that his dust should not
be digged, and cursing him who should interfere with his bones,
but in so mediocre a style, and of such indifferent orthography,
that it is considered by some to be a sort of spurious crypto-
gram composed by Hon'ble BACON.
On such a vexata qucestio I am not to give a decided opinion,
though the verse, as a literary composition, is hardly up to the
level of Hamlet, and it would perhaps have been preferable if
the poet, instead of attempting an impromptu, had looked out
some suitable quotation from his earlier works. For, when an
author is occupied in shuffling off his mortal coil, it is unreason-
able to expect him to produce poetry that is up to the mark.
When I advanced this excuse aloud in the church, a party of
Americans within hearing exclaimed, indignantly, that such
irreverent levity was a scandal in a spot which was the Mecca of
the entire civilized universe.
Whereupon I did protest earnestly that I meant no irreverence,
being nulli secundus in respect for the Genius Loci, only, as a
critic of English Literature, I could not help regretting that a
poet gifted with every requisite for producing a satisfactory
epitaph had produced a doggerel which was undeniably below
his usual par.
This rendered them of an increased ferocity, until Mr. ALL-
BCTT-INNBTT good naturedly took them into a corner and whis-
pered that I was a very wealthy young Indian Prince, of great
scholastic- attainments, but oppressed by an uncontrollable
naïveté, after which they all came and shook me by the hand,
saying they were very proud to have met me.
Afterwards we proceeded to the Birthplace, where я very
gentlewomanly female exhibited the apartment in which the
Infant Bard first saw the light. Alack! there was but little light
to behold, being a shockingly low and dingy room, meagrely
furnished with two chairs and a table, on which was another of
the busts. As I came in, I uttered a remark which I had pre-
pared for the occasion. "It was here," I said, reverently, "here
that the Swan of Avon was hatched!" At which Miss WEB-WEE
was again overcome by emotion.
The room was greatly in the necessity of whitewash, being
black with smoke and signatures in lead pencil. Even the win-
dow-panes were scratched all over by diamonds, on seeing which,
and being also the possessor of a diamond and gold ring, I was
about to inscribe my own name, but was prevented by the lady
custodian.
I indignantly and eloquently protested that if Hon'ble Sirs,
WALTBB SCOTT, Lord BYBON, ISAAC WALTON, WASHINGTON IK-
VINO and Co. were permitted to deface the glass thus, surely I,
who was a graduate of Calcutta University, and a valuable con-
tributor to London Punch, was equally entitled, since what was
sauce for a goose was sauce for a gander, and Mrs. ALLBTTTT-
INNETT urged that I was a distinguished Skakesperian student
and Indian prince, but the custodian responded that she couldn't
lelp that, for it was ultra vires, nevertheless.
However, while she was engaged in pointing out the spot
where somebody's signature had been before it was peeled away,
[, snatching the opportunity behind her back, did triumphantly
inscribe my autograph on the bust's nose.
In the back-room they showed us where SHAKSPEABX'S father
stapled his wool, which caused Mrs. ALLBUTT-INNBTT to remark
that she had always understood that the poet was of quite humble
origin, and that, for her part, she thought it was all the more
creditable to him to have done what he did do.
We also inspected the Museum, and were shown '8нАК-
SPBARE'S jug, a rather ordinary concern; the identical dial which
one of the clowns in his plays drew out of a poke, and a ring
copióos cold tiffin.

ago, and, no doubt, dropped there by the poet himself, while
absorbed in the composition of his famous and world-renowned
elegy-
There were several portraits of him also, all utterly unlike one
another, or only agreeing in one respect, namely, their total
dissimilarity from the bust.
We likewise saw the very desk SHAKSPEARE used, after creep-
ing unwillingly to school with a shining face like a snail's. I was
pained to see evidence of the mischievousness of the juvenile
genius, for it was slashed and hacked to such a doleful degree as
to be totally incapacitated for scholastic use!
I myself was sprightly in my youth, but never, I am proud to
say, to the extent of wilfully damaging my master's furniture!
Before leaving, we walked to visit the residence of SHAKSPEARE'S
wife, which turned out to be a very humble thatched-roof affair,
such as is commonly occupied by peasants.
But, as Mrs. ALLBUTT-ÍNNBTT said, it is a sad fact that dis-
tinguished literary characters often make most imprudent mar-
riages. Which put me in a wonderment whether she had heard
anything about myself and Miss MANKLETOW.
At one of the bazaars I purchased a beautiful Shakspearean
souvenir, in the form of a coloured porcelain model of SHAK-
SPBARE'S birthplace, which can be rendered transparent and lu-
minous by the insertion of a night-light.
This I had intended humbly to offer for the gracious accept-
ance of Miss WBE-WEE, but having thrust it into a coat-tail
pocket, I unfortunately sat upon it in the train as we were re-
turning.
So I presented it as a token of remembrance to JESSIMINA,
who was transported with delight at the gift, which she said could
be easily rendered the statu quo by dint of a little diamond
cement."

mime and graceful dance. Miss MAUD HOBSON towers above the
girls as a Juno among the losser goddesses. Mr. HARRT MONK-

anything to do or say; but in doing, saying, singing, and
dancing, Mr. HUNTLEY WRIGHT, as the rascally heathen Chinee,

To Mr. GEORGE EDWARDXS, who has chosen the caste and

JOTTINGS AND TITTLINGS.
(Вт Влвоо HURRY BUNOSHO JABBERJEE, B.A.)
No. XVI.
¿fr. Jabbcrjee moka a pilgrimage to the Shrine of Shakspeare.
I HAVE frequently spoken in the flattering terms of a eulogium
concerning my extreme partiality for the writings of Hon'ble
WILLIAM ЗНАКВРЕАДВ. It has been remarked, with some correct-
ness, tha^ he did not exist for an age, but all the time; and
though it is the open question whether he did not derive all his
ideas from previous writers, and even whether he wrote so
much as a single line of the plays which are attributed to his

"It wa> here," I said, reverently, "that the Swaii of Avon was hatched!"
inspired nib, he is one of the institutions of the country, and it
»^be correct thing for every orthodox British subject to ad-
mire and understand him even when most incomprehensible.
_ Consequently I did cock-a-hoop for joy on receiving an invita-
ron from my friend ALLBUTT-INNETT, Jun., Esq., on behalf of
ш parents, that I should accompany them on an excursion by
rail to Stratford-upon-Avon, where the said poet had his domi-
cile of origin.
And so great was ray enthusiasm that, during the journey, I
declaimed, ore rotundo, certain select passages from his works
which I had committed to memory during the salad days of my
schoolboyishness, and with such effect that Miss WM-WEB ALL-
готт-lNNETT _ (who is excessively emotional) was compelled, at
imcs, to veil her countenance in the recesses of a pocket-
ion dkerchief.
Having at length arrived at that hallowed and sacred spot, the
very name of which sends a sweet and responsive thrill through
every educated bosom, our first proceeding was to partake «fa
This repast we ordered at an old-fashioned hostelry, whose
doorway was decorated by a counterfeit persentment of the
Bard, and I observed that similar effigies were placed above
several of the shops as I walked along the streets. These images
somewhat resemble those erected to Buddha in certain parts of
India, being similarly bald, but terminating—not in crossed
legs, but a cushion with tassels. However, I was not able to
discover that it is the custom for even the most ignorant in-
habitants to do anything in the nature of a poojah before these
figures any longer, though probably usual enough before Свом-
WBLL. with the iron sides, ordered all such baubles to be removed.
In a hole in the upper wall of the Town Hall there is a life-size
statuary of SHAKSPBABE, with legs complete, showing that he
was not actually deficient in such extremities and a mere gifted
torso; and it is presumable that the reason why only his upper
portions are generally represented is, that marble in these parts
is too precious a commodity to be wasted on superfluities.
We visited the church, and saw his tomb, and there again was
the superior half of him occupied with writing verses on a
cushion in a mural niche, supported by pillars. Upon a slab
below is inscribed a verse requesting that his dust should not
be digged, and cursing him who should interfere wdth his bones,
but in so mediocre a style, and of such indifferent orthography,
that it is considered by some to be a sort of spurious crypto-
gram composed by Hon'ble BACON.
On such a vexata qvœstio I am not to give a decided opinion,
though the verse, as a literary composition, is hardly up to the
level of Hamlet, and it would perhaps have been preferable if
the poet, instead of attempting an impromptu, had looked out
some suitable quotation from his earlier works. For, when an
author is occupied in shuffling off his mortal coil, it is unreason-
able to expect nim to produce poetry that is up to the mark.
When I advanced this excuse aloud in the church, a party of
Americans within hearing exclaimed, indignantly, that such
irreverent levity was a scandal in a spot which was the Mecca of
the entire civilized universe.
Whereupon I did protest earnestly that I meant no irreverence,
being nulli secundus in respect for the Genius Loci, only, as a
critic of English Literature, I could not help regretting that a
poet gifted with every requisite for producing a satisfactory
epitaph had produced a doggerel which was undeniably below
his usual par.
This rendered them of an increased ferocity, until Mr. ALL-
BUTT-INNETT good naturedly took them into a corner and whis-
pered that I was a very wealthy young Indian Prince, of great
scholastic attainments, but oppressed by an uncontrollable
naïrrli'. after which they all came and shook me by the hand,
saying they were very proud to have met mo.
Afterwards we proceeded to the Birthplace, where a very
gentlewomanly female exhibited the apartment in which the
Infant Bard first saw the light. Alack! there was but little light
to behold, being a shockingly low and dingy room, meagrely
furnished with two chairs and a table, on which was another of
the buste. As I came in, I uttered a remark which I had pre-
pared for the occasion. "It was here," I said, reverently, "here
that the Swan of Avon was hatched!" At which Miss WBB-WEE
was again overcome by emotion.
The room was greatly in the necessity of whitewash, being
black with smoke and signatures in lead pencil. Even the win-
dow-panes were scratched all over by diamonds, on seeing which,
and being also the possessor of a diamond and gold ring, I was
about to inscribe my own name, but was prevented by the lady
custodian.
I indignantly and eloquently protested that if Hon'ble Sirs,
WALTEB SCOTT, Lord BYBON, ISAAC WALTON. WASHINGTON IK-
VINO and Co. were permitted to deface the glass thus, surely I,
who was a graduate of Calcutta University, and a valuable con-
tributor to London Punch, was equally entitled, since what was
sauce for a goose was sauce for a gander, and Mrs. ALLBUTT-
INNBTT urged that I was a distinguished Skakesperian student
and Indian prince, but the custodian responded that she couldn't
help that, for it was ultra vires, nevertheless.
However, while she was engaged in pointing out the spot
where somebody's signature had been before it was peeled away,
I, snatching the opportunity behind her back, did triumphantly
inscribe my autograph on the bust's nose.
In the back-room they showed us where SHAKSPKAKE'S father
stapled his wool, which caused Mrs. ALLBUTT-!NNBTT to remark
that she had always understood that the poet was of quite humble
origin, and that, for her part, she thought it was all the more
creditable to him to have done what he did do.
We also inspected the Museum, and were shown -SHAK-

MONSIEUR ы REDACTEUR, — Accom-
rmied by several of my brave comrades,
arrived this week in your splendid city
of commerce to join in the magnificent
demonstration which celebrated the vic-
tories of the limpid Water over the cruel
and devastating Fire—elements ever at
war and encouraged to fight à l'outrance
by the bitter memories of tradition and
history. All the sympathies of your land
are w'ith the aqueous fluid: your island
rests upon the planturous bosom of the
ocean, your skies are rarely free from a
copious supply of tears, and you are never
weary of boasting of your amphibious na-
ture, while your great Lord WILFRID is, I
understand, the incarnation of old Père
Tamise filtered and potable.
I imagined then that my eyes would be
gladdened by noble fountains — monu-
ments of your cult—arranged in your pub-
lic squares and verdant parks. Ah I Mon-
sieur, how bitterly have I been unde-
ceived! In that place on which you have
bestowed the name of some successful
skirmish where my nation was betrayed by
the perfidious Spaniard, your hero NBLSOX
looks down from an inaccessible pillar,
like St. Simon Stylites, on a collection of
extraordinary caricatures of humanity,
plaisanterie. But the Admiral also sur-
veys, with complacent stoicism, the gam-
bols of countless gamins beside two igno-
ble and lamentable ponds, defiled with
paper and fruit refuse, whence some
wretched jets d'eau, feebly pointing to
heaven, seem to imploro the clouds to try
and renew their strength. These, I was
told, were the most famous fountains in
London!
Unable to believe my senses, I in-
quired of a respectable policeman. He
answered me, with the respectable assur-
ance of un vrai Jean Boule, that the me-
tropolis was, on the contrary, renowned
for its fountains, situated all over its im-
mence area, and that they were devoted
not onlv to the recreation and refresh-
ment of the human race, as well as of
horses, cattle, and even dogs. Then I
know, that despite his grave exterior,
this guardian of the law must be a far-
ceur, and I set forth in one of your han-
som cabriolets to endeavour to find some
specimens of your hydraulic art. Alas!
without that success, which every explorer
hopes for. My landlord indeed told me
that the grands eaux of Versailles were
fairly rivalled at the Palais de Cristal on
certain rare occasions, but that he knew
of no other displays. I marvel, I am sad,
even after consuming your exhilirating

your estimable influence. Agree, &c.,

ROUNDABOUT READINGs.
MY BROTHER-IN-LAw, .
*
(Continued.)
WHEN I left off the story of my brother-in-law, HARRY, in
these columns, matters had come to a desperate pass. This as-
tonishing young gentleman seemed to have exhausted not only
the discomforts and the luxuries of civilisation, but also all its
resources, and there appeared to be no other course open to me
but to support him for the rest of my life in various positions
that made severe inroads on the balance at my bankers. Alice,
of course, was delighted. “I knew,” she observed to me, “when
I married you that you would always be good and kind to
HARRY, that you would take the place of his dear father—and
Aunt MARGARET and Aunt ELEANon knew it too. You mustn't
think I am not grateful. I am deeply, deeply grateful to you,
and so I am sure is HARRY... See what trouble that boy is taking
to oblige you, to fall in with all your wishes. What more can he
do?” As HARRY's trouble had for the most part consisted in ac-
cepting one after another the various amusements (together with
their neeessary cheques) that I had thought out for him, I was un-
able to answer my dear wife with the enthusiasm she evidently
expected. “No matter,” she said, “some day when HARRY has
done something of which we shall all be proud, you will be
SoMETHING, however, as I said, had to be done, and I cast
about for the means of doing it. I had not made up my mind
what it was to be, but in my pleasanter day-dreams I pictured
it as something that should finally take HARRY away and dis-
#. of him. It happened just about this time that, my old
friend Sir GREgoRY Johnston came up to London from his place
in the East Riding of Yorkshire and paid me his customary visit.
Sir GREGoRY is one of the bluffest, the cheeriest, and the best
of country squires. He has been a member of the House of
Commons, but at a recent General Election “those confounded
agitators,” as he calls his Radical opponents, were too many for
him, and since the disastrous day that saw his defeat, Sir
GREGoRY has retired from active politics, for which, to tell the
truth, he never cared, and has devoted himself to his family, to
his neighbours, and to the management of his estate. Sir
GREGoRY, although as a youngster he had kept the dons
alive at Öxford, and had afterwards had a short, but coruscat-
ing, period of service, in the Grenadier Guards, is now a good,
prejudiced, steady-going country gentleman of the most pro-
nounced and orthodox type. In his part of the world—I judge
by his conversation—the ºndi interest has been irretrievably
ruined for years º; and as a necessary consequence the United
Kingdom generally has gone to perdition, has become the laugh-
ing stock of foreign nations, so that now “any two-penny half-
penny little foreign ºl. Heaven help us, has only to show
its miserable apologies for teeth, and we grovel, Sir, yes, grovel
as if we’d been licked.” . But au fond Sir GREGoRY, in spite of
his prejudices and his violence, is one of the best, and softest-
hearted men I know, a man, too, of infinite good nature and
admirable cheerfulness.
When Sir Gregory came into my chambers at the Temple
the atmosphere of the place and the whole scene, indeed, seemed
to undergo a magical change. In place of the shelf where. I
..". law reports I seemed to see a well-kept stable with its
stalls neatly covered in straw, plaited and bound at the edges,
and a round dozen or so of sleek horses stamping and munching
and drawing their head-stall straps with a run through the iron
rings, while a tight-trousered, bandy-legged groom, his braces
down and his shirt-sleeves rolled up, pulled back the horse-
clothes and slapped the resounding flanks of the kindly beasts,
My *::::::::. with all its briefs, turned into a dog-kennel,
and a dairy set itself up in the corner reserved for my text-
books. And over all there floated that combined aroma of cows,
horses, dogs, corn, and stored apples which always lingers
lovingly over those who spend their Sunday mornings at a country
house in making the usual round outside. The impression was
only momentary. As it dissipated itself I found myself #.;
Sir GREGoRY by the hand and interchanging with him the usu
questions and answers.
“Look here, my boy,” said Sir GREGoRy, “you might be very
useful to me. I’ve been trying to manage my confounded estate
myself lately, but it’s too much for me. Now if you know a
young fellow, a presentable chap, of course, a good sportsman,
and all that, who could come and help me—do a bit of land-
agency, in fact, I should be glad to hear of him. I couldn't give
him much in the way of a salary, but there’s a good cottage and
any amount of " But Sir GREGoRY never detailed the
amount, for before he could go any farther, I had told him that
the one man of all others in the whole world who would suit the
place, who was designed by nature to be a land-agent, was my
brother-in-law, HARRY. At any rate, to cut a long matter short, I
shortly afterwards introduced HARRY to Sir GREGoRY, who took
| a fancy to him, and in less than a fortnight HARRY was off to
help in managing the estate of Sir GREGoRY in Yorkshire.

possible to discredit a powerful Ministry.
Now is time for MARK TAFLET, M.P., to
appear on scene. Comes forth in person
of HENRY MEYSEY-THOMPSON, Bart.
House on report stage of Agricultural
Rating Bill. Opposition cock-a-whoop
after unexpected victory. Ministerialists
correspondingly depressed.
"What 's it aft about?" asks thr
AMEYSEYNC-TnoMPSON, slapping himself
on the breast as was Mark Tapley's
wont. "What's happened? I'm just go-
ing down to see my constituents, and I 'II
tell you what I'm going to say to them."
That would have been delightful. No-
thing House would have enjoyed more
than having MEYSEY-TAPLEY-THOMPSON'S
speech to his constituents rehearsed. But
SPEAKER inexorable. It had, he blandly
said, nothing to do with Rating Bill.
However interesting pleasure of listening,
it must be foregone. So M.-T.-T. sat
down with all his music in him. But
mere interposition of his breezy presence
had same effect as accompanied move-
ments of Mark Tapley. Ministerialists
plucked up courage. Opposition drew in
their horns. SQUIRE OF BLANKNEY hung
his white silk pocket-handkerchief another
yard out of his breast pocket, and showed
with fuller confidence Tiow the three-card
trick of the Rating Bill equally benefits
Landlord, Farmer, nnd Labourer.
liusiness done.—Rating Bill at report
stage.
Thursday.—" No use HBNNIKER-HEATON
trying to intimidate me by shooting at
HANBURY," Duke of NORFOLK is reported
to have said. Those are brave words.
But if HENMKER isn't soon raised to peer-
ago where he may face JOCKEY o' NOB-
FOLK on equal terms, HANBURY must go
there. It 's terrible to be pelted night
after nipht with pellets from pillar letter
boxes. To-night HENNIKER insisted that
HAVBURY should, right off, explain why
some postmasters charge "bonheur" as
course with "alright." Even case-hard-
ened Secretary to Treasury must be
touched by cruel disappointment under-
gone by fellow-creature who, probably as
result of sitting up all night, invented word
"alright," proffered it as part of a tele-
gram, and found a penny charged for it,
instead of a halfpenny as he had hoped.
HANBURY concealing his emotion, gave
customary official reply. Thought ordeal
over for night. HENNIKER down on him
like a shot with another conundrum.
"Why is father-in-law charged as three
words, and mother-in-law as one?"
"I was," HANBURY told me later, "go-
ing to reply that there is an instinct with
a certain class of men that impels them to
make as little as possible of their mother-
in-law. Might have led to controversy;
thought it better to say nothing. But
must get rid of HENNIKER. Wonder if
he 'd accept mission to inspect and report
upon telegraph service in Mashonaland?
Lines in neighbourhood of Buluwayo and
Fort Salisbury just now offer interesting
field for man of active habits."
Business done.—Working through re-
port stage of Rating Bill.
Friday. — Sad to watch demoralising
effect of Ministerial defeat on faithful
follower, JOHNSTON OF BALLYKILBEO. All
through his Parliamentary life has kept
up fusillade against his compatriots of
another faith sitting opposite. Ever ready
to beat the Orange drum when need were
to drown the music of the Catholic horn.
But apparent ferocity only his fun. SARK,
who knows them both, always insists that
the two kindest-hearted, gentlest-mannered
men in House are those redoubtable con-
troversialists TIM HEALY and JOHNSTON OF
BALLYKILBEG.
Defeat of esteemed leaders on Treasury
Bench has, only temporarily it is hoped,
soured BAT.LYKILBEG'S temper. The
other night when JOHN DILLON was
picturing period of millennium in Belfast,
whereat Lord Mayor of the Orange City
shook hands over an arrangement of the
Corporation Bill, BALLYKILBEO interpo-
lated the remark, "PILATE- and HEROD I"
The House shuddered. Last time HEROD
was introduced into Parliamentary debate
he was followed by pointed reference to
JUDAS, leading up to the famous free fight.
Vf embers held their breath and _ waited.
Happily nothing came of it. But incident
marks the deep stirring of a gentle nature,
and shows how men's hearts _ have been
riven by the event of a historic week.

Тнв nimble minutes fly apace,
And yet you do not keep our tryst;
The bracken springs with sprightly grace
Amid the silver morning mist.
The early bird on yonder lawn
Is sapient gourmet of the wood,
And hails the herald of the dawn
As tried purveyor of his food.
But I have not yet broken fast—
My drowsy vassals kept their rooms
When I desconded; and o'ercast
A scene demanding air and brooms.
We were a merry crowd last night
Neath wit and whiskey's mingled spell—
I say "last night," but morning light
Was breaking ere we bade "Farewell 1"
My comrades went to seek their rest
Like foemen weary of the fray—
If snoring of repose be test,
They '11 wake refreshed for lunch to-day.
But I have never closed my eyes,
Remembering whom I now shall meet.
The love that time and temper tries,
Is one that makes us long to eat 1
Yes! underneath this grand old oak
That seems for something hot to beg,
Where first our faithful vows we spoke,
Those birds suggest a new-laid egg.
That troutlet leaping in the stream _

Mefistofele, with MARGUERITE MACINTYRH
as two single ladies rolled into one, name-
ly, Margherita and Elena: of course, a
double attraction. EDWABD DB RESZKE
magnificent as Mefistofele. CREMONINI
not strong enough for Faust. But Faust
was a rather weak person. BOITO'S opera
is a very remarkable work, and the Covent
Garden Management is justified, "on this
occasion only," in issuing a printed re-
quest to those of the audience who cannot
romain till the end, to leave "during the
interval preceding it." But audiences,
especially operatic, dp not approve of being
dictated to. Also, liking to be considered
as habitues, they flatter themselves they
know when to come and when to leave
without being ushered in or ordered out.
MAGGIB MAO obtained a lovely bouquet.
The quartette at end of Second Act was
deservedly and vociferously encored. Mas-
terful Mefistofele-Mancinelli led his band
to victory. Mefistofele notable as being
one of the very few operas in which there
is no part for Mile. BAUERMEISTER.
Thursday. — Carmen. A grand perfor-
mance. Is there a better Carmen than
Mile. /KI.IK DE I,U88AN? If so, name her.
Watch her by-play, technically known as
"business." It is a study; it is admira-
ble. In the Third Act, M. ALVAREZ scored,
not musically, but dramatically, as Don
José, when, losing his temper with the
perfidious light-o'-love Carmen, he dashes
her to the ground. And how excellent
in this situation was ZELLE DB LUSSAN!
Scared, as if she were saying, "Well, I am
dashed to the ground! and dazed 1"
Admirable contrast in appearance is

surprise on seeing this enormous panto-
mime basket, as who would say, "Lawks!
is this for me, poor little me?" With the
BRITANNIA AT HENLEY.
Oa, I am a wet-bob nurse, I am,
And I know in y way by the Gat of Cam,
And the similar Gut of Isis;
And the one, they say, is the source of all
The nautical virtues, great and small,
And the other of all the vices.
But I think at the end of a four-mile show
That a margin of eight mere yarda or so
Is a most exceedingly tight one;
And had both been reared on the self-
same ditch,
I M have certainly backed—well, I won't
say which—
But certainly backed the right one.
But to-day our friends from the far, far
West.
Shall put, if they can, to a crucial test
The fame of our Old-world fettle;
For when Thames and Isis and Cam com-
bine,
There 's work to be done if they 'd take the
shine
From our polished Britannia mettle.
A* a matter of faith I 'm free to confess
That nothing succeeds like the old success,
In the track of a tried commander;
And with NICKALLS at need to pull them
through,
I pin my hopes to the crimson crew,
To the luck of our loved Leander.
But I pray that the pick of the lot may
win
Through the ding-dong rattle from Faw-
ley in,
When the throb of the heart goes
shorter;
When sister Britannia's well-known throat
Sends back like thunder her best top-note,
To the yell of the Yale supporter.
They may yell "Yale, Yale!" as they
yelfed "Cornell 1 *
Till they 're black in the face and as hoarse
as—Hades,
On the boom for the bold Uitlander;
But I guess that my best top-note is
worth
A couple of lengths and the inside berth,
To the backers of old Leander.

Now is time for MARK TAFLET, M.P., to
appear on scene. Comes forth in person

House on report stage of Agricultural
Rating Bill. Opposition cock-a-whoop
after unexpected victory. Ministerialists
correspondingly depressed.
"What 's it aH about?" asks the
AMEYSEYNG-TIIOMPSON, slapping himself
on the breast as was Mark Tapley's
wont. "WЪat 's happened? I 'm just go-
ing down to see my constituents, and I 'II
tell you what I'm going to say to them.';
That would have been delightful. No-
thing House would have enjoyed more
than having MEYSEY-TAPLEY-THOMPSON'S
speech to his constituents rehearsed. But
SPEAKER inexorable. It had, he blandly
said, nothing to do with Rating Bill.
However interesting pleasure of listening,
it must be foregone. So M.-T.-T. sat
down with all his music in him. But
mere interposition of his breezy presence
had same effect as accompanied move-
ments of Mark Tapky. Ministerialists
plucked up courage. Opposition drew in
their horns. SQUIRE OF BLANKNEY hung
his white silk pocket-handkerchief another
yard out of his breast pocket, and showed

Jîu-siness done.—Rating Bill at report
stage.
Thursday.—" No use HBNNIKER-HEATON
trying to intimidate me by shooting at
HANBURY," Duke of NORFOLK is reported
to have said. Those are brave words.
But if HENNIKER isn't soon raised to peer-
ago where he may face JOCKEY o' NOR-
FOLK on equal terms, HANBURY must go
there. It 's terrible to be pelted night
after night with pellets from pillar letter
boxes. To-night HENNIKER insisted that
HAVBURY should, right off, explain why
some postmasters charge "/данЛеиг" as
course with "alright." Even case-hard-
ened Secretary to Treasury must be
touched by cruel disappointment under-
gone by fellow-creature who, probably as
result of sitting up all night, invented word
"alright," proffered it as part of a tele-
gram, and found a penny charged for it,
instead of a halfpenny as he had hoped.
HANBURY concealing his emotion, gave
customary official reply. Thought ordeal
over for night. HENNIKER down on him
like a shot with another conundrum.
"Why is father-in-law charged as three
words, and mother-in-law as one?"
"I was," HANBURY told me later, "go-
ing to reply that there is an instinct with
a certain class of men that impels them to
make as little as possible of their mother-
in-law. Might have led to controversy;
thought it better to say nothing. But
must get rid of HENNIKBR. \Vonder if
he 'd accept mission to inspect and report
upon telegraph service in Mashonaland?
Lines in neighbourhood of Buluwayo and
Fort Salisbury just now offer interesting
field for man of active habits."
-Business done.—W7orking through re-
port stage of Rating Bill.
Friday. — Sad to watch demoralising
effect of Ministerial defeat on faithful
follower, JOHNSTON OF BALLYKILBEG. All
through his Parliamentary life has kept
up fusillade against his compatriote of
another faith sitting opposite. Ever ready
to beat the Orange drum when need were
to drown the music of the Catholic horn.
But apparent ferocity only his fun. SARK,
who knows them both, always insists that
the two kindest-hearted, gentlest-mannered
men in House are those redoubtable con-
troversialists TIM HEALY and JOHNSTON OF
BALLYKILBEG.
Defeat of esteemed leaders on Treasury
Bench has, only temporarily it is hoped,
soured BALLYKILBEG'S temper. The
other night when JOHN DILLON was
picturing period of millennium in Belfast,
whereat Lord Mayor of the Orange City
shook hands over an arrangement of the
Corporation Bill, BALLYKILBEO interpo-
lated the remark, "PILATB and H KIWI» I"
The House shuddered. Last time HEROD
was introduced into Parliamentary debate
he was followed by pointed reference to
JUDAS, leading up to the famous free fight.
Members held their breath and waited.
Happily nothing came of it. But incident
marks the deep stirring of a gentle nature,
and shows how men's hearts have been
riven by the event of a historic week.

BRITANNIA AT HENLEY.
Он, I am a wet-bob nurse, I am,
And I know my way by the Gut of Cam,
And the similar Gut of Isis;
And the one, they say, is the source of all
The nautical virtues, great and small,
And the other of all the vices.
But I think at the end of a four-mile show
That a margin of eight mere yards or во
Is a most exceedingly tight one:
And had both been reared on the self-
same ditch,
I 'd have certainly backed—well, I won't
say which—
But certainly backed the right one.
But to-day our friends from the far, far
West
Shall put, if they can. to a crucial test
The fame of our Old-world fettle;
For when Thames and Isis and Cam com-
bine,
There 's work to be done if they 'd take the
shine
From our polished Britannia mettle.
AÏ a matter of faith I 'm free to confess
That nothing succeeds like the old success,
In the track of a tried commander;
And with XICKALLS at need to pull them
through,
I pin my hopes to the crimson crew,
To the luck of our loved Leander.
But I pray that the pick of the lot may
win
Through the ding-dong rattle from Faw-
ley in,
When the throb of the heart goes
shorter;
When sister Britannia's well-known throat
Sends back like thunder her best top-note,
To the yell of the Yale supporter.
They may yell "Yale, Yale!" as they
yelled "Cornell I"
Till they 're black in the face and as hoarse
as-—Hades,
On the boom for the bold Uitlander;
But I guess that my best top-note is
worth
A couple of lengths and the inside berth,
To the backers of old Leander.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVAEI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
IT ¡я m little lit« in the day to mention ARTHUR MOEKISON'S
Tales of titan Street» (published by MBTIHTEN). but personally
I find that, at this season of the year, "late in the day," that IB
the cool of the night, ¡я just the very best time for quiet reading,
when the busy man, having "cornered himself" comfortably,
can peruse at leisure—without fear of interruption. This
was my case—my book-case—after a delightful day on the river
in the launch of the WILL-RID DOUGLAS, of that ilk, in the open
air, on the lovely river. Then, bodily fatigued, mentally active,
I sat down to two stories out of Tales of Mean Streets. By
this time everyone knows them. The first story, "Lizarunt,"
is Zola-esque. It is written, however, with a humour that ZOLA
posseeseth not, and it is this quality that saves it from being
hideously repulsive. Without knowing from personal experience
that the sketch is true to Ufe, the reader feels that it must be
so, as such brutality cannot be imagined, or, if imagined, could
not be put into dramatic action, or on record. "Horrible, most
horrible," as the immortal WILLIB hath it. "But humorous,
most humorous," aye, and most Charles Dickensly humorous is
the bigamistic story of "That Brute Simmons," which is, as it
were, a kind of Enoch Arden tale, admirably burlesqued.
However, the book is "connu," and I come in late with my
praise. No matter, "Better late than never."
With possibly unpremeditated, certainly effective, art, Mr.
KISIIF.R UNWIN, in publishing Mr. FITZGERALD'S Climbs in the
New Zealand Alps, nas produced a volume almost mountainous
m size, magnificent in get up. The story is worthy of its frame-
work. Mr. FITZGERALD, weary of the comparative commonplace
of the European Alps, turned for freeh worlds to conquer amid
the grim, little-known sisterhood in far-off New Zealand. Here
are still to be found virgin peaks with hoary heads, never caressed
by human hand, soaring into clouds which, according to Mr.
FiTzGiBALD's account, continually do rage. Why a man having
a moderately comfortable home to dwell in should wish to spend
a few nights and days on the top of a mountain, whose attraction
is apparently increased by its grim inaccessibility, is a matter
my Baronite cannot understand. Mr. FITZGERALD during his
ascents of Mounts Sefton, Tasman. Sealy, Haidinger, and other
uncomfortable places, was snowed upon, rained upon, blown
about, dropped into crevasses, suspended by ropes over fathom-
less chasms, and, when not thus actively enjoying life, slept in
a bag after having had nothing particular for dinner. Tempta-
tion to quote far exceeds possibilities of space. But here is a
brief passage descriptive of the delights of mountaineering: —
"Our clothes, beards, and hair hung with icicles, while the rope between us
was covered with ice, rigid like an iron bar. The mist was so thick that it
was at times impossible to see each other."
Through this and other experiences the small party—which,
in addition to Mr. FITZGERALD, consisted of a Swiss guide and a
New Zealand porter, who chiefly spent his time in getting in the
way whether of man or mountain—doggedly, even cheer-
fully, struggled, winning their way to the desired heights. The
narrative is picturesquely told. The volume is enriched by a
valuable map, and is illustrated with rarely beautiful pictures
drawn from photographs taken on the spot. Тпн BABÓN.

by human hand, soaring into clouds which, according to Mr.
FITZGERALD'S account, continually do rage. Why a man having
a moderately comfortable home to dwell in should wish to spend
a few nighte and days on the top of a mountain, whose attraction
is apparently increased by its grim inaccessibility, is я matter
my Baronite cannot understand. Mr. FITZGERALD during his
ascents of Mounts Sefton, Tasman, Sealy, Haidinger, and other
uncomfortable places, was snowed upon, rained upon, blown
about, dropped into crevasses, suspended by ropes over fathom-
legs chasms, and, when not thus actively enjoying life, slept in
a bag after having had nothing particular for dinner. Tempta-
tion to quote far exceeds possibilities of space. Bat here is а
brief passage descriptive of the delighto of mountaineering : —
"Our clothes, beards, nnd hair hung with icicles, while the rope between us
was covered with ice, rigid like an iron bar. The mist was so thick that it
was at times impossible to see each other."
Through this and other experiences the small party—which,
in addition to Mr. FITZGERALD, consisted of a Swiss guide and a
New Zealand porter, who chiefly spent his time in getting in the
way whether of man or mountain—doggedly, even cheer-
fully, struggled, winning their way to the desired heights. The
narrative is picturesquely told. The volume is enriched_ by a
valuable map, and is illustrated with rarely beautiful picture«

FINANCIAL ADVICE.
(From Oie Pvpplelim College Gazette.)
DEAR JACK.—Business matters have been
fairly quiet this week, although prices have
fluctuated considerably. Money is less
abundant than it was a few weeks ago at
the beginning of the term. JONES major,
however, one of our most dashing specu-
lators, expects a visit from an uncle at
the end of the week, who is not unlikely
to furnish him with a fresh supply of
capital. It is rumoured that, with the aid
of this, JONES intends to create a comer
in white mice. As these commodities are
very cheap at their present price (two
cakes or a pocket-knife), you will do well
to purchase as many as possible, with a view
to unloading later. Aaother security that
1 can honestly commend as a sound in-
vestment is KELLY'S Cesar cribs. They
are, I know, at a considerable discount
just now, but the price is sure to advance
greatly in a few weeks' time, when the
examinations are close at hand. BOHN'S
gilt-edged ditto are also cheap, but, from
the fact that they cannot easily be con-
cealed under the coat, are not likely to
do as well as KELLT'S. There has been
some movement in catapults, owing to the
confiscation of a large number by one of
the masters; indeed, they rose 2J points
(from 4Jd. to 6d.) on Tuesday. But I
cannot recommend them, except as a
speculation, for it is not unlikely that
the introduction of the cheap home-made
substitute will bring down the piice with
a run. I may also repeat my warning to
you to beware of such purchases as Jews'
harps and the like. The boom in these
invariably is very short-lived, and the
rash buyer of any quantity will only be
enabled to realise at an enormous loss On
the other hand, I should hold silkworms
for a rise.

I must refer once more to the very un-
satisfactory report of the Potted Meat
Syndicate, Limited. This company was
flouted, as you will remember, with the
object of providing ite shareholders with
potted meat at tea for the whole term.
A very large number of half-crown shares
were _ applied for, but the potted meat
•supplied so far has been insufficient in
quantity and inferior in quality. And now
SMITH major and his fellow-directors have
issued a further call of one shilling per
share! All the shareholders are naturally
disgusted at this result, and I hope a
searching inquiry will be made into the
manner in which these self-elected direc-
tors have managed the Syndicate's affairs.
Under these circumstances, the failure
to float the School House Pocket-money
Trust is not to be wondered at. Its origi-
nators proposed to take the pocket-money
of every boy in the House for three weeks,
in order to provide a grand feast at the
end of term. But the chance of any
dividends seemed rather remote to the
majority of speculators. Trusting that
you will find my hints of service to you
in your financial transactions, believe me,
my dear JACK,
Yours affectionately, TOMMY.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
IT is » little bit« in the day to mention ARTHUR MommisoN's
Tales of Mean Streeti (published by MiTiruev). but personally
I find that, at this season of the year, "late in the day," that in
the cool of the night, is just the very best time for quiet reading,
when the busy man, having "cornered himself" comfortably,
can peruse at leisure—without fear of interruption. This
was my case—my book-case—after a delightful day on the river
in the launch of the WELL-RIO DOTJOLAS, of that ilk, in the open
air, on the lovely river. Then, bodily fatigued, mentally active,
I sat down to two stories out of Talet of Mean Street». By
this time everyone knows them. The first story, "Lizarunt,"
is Zola-esque. It ia written, however, with a humour that ZOLA
posseeseth not, and it is this quality that saves it from being
hideously repulsive. Without knowing from personal experience
that the sketch is true to life, the reader feels that it must be
so, as such brutality cannot be imagined, or, if imagined, could
not be put into dramatic action, or on record. "Horrible, most
horrible," as the immortal WILLIE hath it. "But humorous,
most humorous," aye, and most Charles Dickensly humorous is
the bigamistic story of "That Brute Simmons," which is, as it
were, a kind of Enoch Arden tale, admirably burlesqued.
However, the book is "connu," and I come in late with my
praise. No matter, "Better late than never."
With possibly unpremeditated, certainly effective, art, Mr.
FISHER UNWIN, in publishing Mr. FITZGERALD'S Climln in the
New Zealand Alps, has produced a volume almost mountainous
in size, magnificent in get up. The story is worthy of its frame-
work. Mr. FITZGERALD, weary of the comparative commonplace
of the European Alps, turned for fresh worlds to conquer amid
the grim, little-known sisterhood in far-off New Zealand. Here
are still to be found virgin peaks with hoary heads, never caressed
by human hand, soaring into clouds which, according to Mr.
FITZGERALD'S account, continually do rage. Why a man having
a moderately comfortable home to dwell in should wish to spend
a few nights and days on the top of a mountain, whose attraction
is apparently increased by its grim inaccessibility, is a matter
my Baronite cannot understand. Mr. FITZGERALD during his
ascents of Mounts Sefton, Tasman, Sealy, Haidinger, and other
uncomfortable places, was snowed upon, rained upon, blown
about, dropped into crevasses, suspended by ropes over fathom-
less chasms, and, when not thus actively enjoying life, slept in
a bag after having had nothing particular for dinner. Tempta-
tion to quote far exceeds possibilities of space. But here is a
brief passage descriptive of the delights of mountaineering : —
"Our clothes, beards, und hair hung with icicles, while the rope between us
was covered with ice, rigid like an iron bar. The mist was so thick that it
was at times impossible to see each other."
Through this and other experiences the small party—which,
in addition to Mr. FITZGERALD, consisted of a Swiss guide and a
New Zealand porter, who chiefly spent his time in getting in the
way whether of man or mountain—doggedly, even cheer-
fully, struggled, winning their way to the desired heights. The

A LESSON IN POLITICS.
WHAT ARE TORIES AND RADICALS, GRANDPAPA?"
"TORIES, MY DEAR, ARE PEOPLE WHO LIKE то HAVE A QUEEN,

—WHILST RADICALS OBJECT то HAVING A QUEEN AND A HOUSE OF
LORDS, AND ARE DISSATISFIED WITH EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY,
JEALOUS OF ALL WHO ARE 11ETTER OFF THAN THEMSELVES, AND ARE

THEY 'RE A PACK OF INFERNAL ROGUES AND SCOUNDRELS!"
"AND WHICH ARE YOU, GRANDPAPA—A TORY OR A RADICAL?"
ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
MY BROTHER-IN-LAW.
How is it, I hare often asked myself, that youngsters of a more
or less proved incapacity, turn, as a last desperate resort, to the
occupation and calling of a land-agent? The greatest thickhead in
the world, supposing him, jet us say, to fail after repeated attempts
to secure a Commission in Her Majesty's forces, will as a rule
tell you that there is something within him that makes him
certain he would shine in land-agency. He seems to imagine
that the business consists merely in riding good horses, in inter-
viewing an occasional refractory tenant, in shooting, and in pay-
ing visits to the Metropolis. Of the keeping of accounts, of
the orderly management of a great estate with the nundred
details that go to it he never thinks. Only let him be a land-
agent, and he seee himself fixed for life in comfortable quarters
with good food, and as little to do as is compatible with con-
tinued existence. _
HARRY, at any rate, had no scruples of any kind. "My dear
old man," he had said, when I communicated Sir GREGORY'S
offer to him, "¡с'ь the very thing for me. I always told you
up in Yorkshire I'm a Dutchman." This eeemed to me to be
hârdly the epirit in which such an offer should be accepted,
bat the great point was that HABET was disposed of, and there
was я reasonable hope that he might really do well in his new
position, and cease to be an incubus on me. There were just
a few little bills, he had hinted, that he would like to pay off
before starting, so ae to begin with a clear record. There was,
for instance, a rascally cigar merchant who had stuck him with a
cabinet of Cabanas, there was a clamorous jeweller who had made
a mean insinuation with regard to a writ, there were tailors,
bootmakers and haberdashers. The total staggered me, but
as this was really to be the last time, I resolved to pay and look
as pleasant as I could. ALIOB said I had acted as I ought to
act, and that it would have been a sinful thing to send the poor
boy to Yorkshire with a millstone of debt round his neck.
Thus handicapped, she declared, it would not be possible for
him to take a real interest in his new pursuit—besides, she had
read only last week a distressing account of a market-gardener
who had committed suicide because he couldn't pay his rent,
and she knew that HARRY had the proud and sensitive nature
which was peculiar to all the members of her family, and who
knew what might have happened if I had refused to pay. \Vith
these and other arguments, all equally convincing and irresistible,
did my wife prove to me that I had in paying taken the only
course which was open to me as a gentleman and a brother-in-
law.
THUS HAHHY eet off for Halesworthy Hall, and for a time
everything seemed to be going well. Sir GREGORY was pleased,
HAKKY was delighted, and a blessed feeling of relief pervaded
all my domestic arrangements. All this was much too good
to last, and acordingly, in the fourth month after HARRY'S de-
parture, I received from him the following rather startling
letter : —" MY DEAR Том,—Don't be surprised at what I 'm
going to tell you. The fact is, I never had an idea there was
going to be such a mortal lot of grind and sweat about this
blessed business. I don't get a single moment to myself, and I
had to chuck three good shooting invites all in one week because
there were estate accounts to be made up. I never was much
of a hand at figures, you know, and Sir GREGORY expects me
to know no end about heifers and sheep and things. So I 've
told him that for both our sakes I thought we had better part.
i it course I put it as nicely as possible so as not to hurt the old

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A LESSON IN POLITICS.
WHAT ARS TORIES AND RADICALS, GRANDPAPA?"
"TORIES, MY DEAR, ARE PEOPLE WHO LIKE то HAVE A QUEEN,
AND LORDS, AND BISHOPS, AND MORE OR LESS REMAIN AS THEY ARK
—WHILST RADICALS OBJECT то HAVING A QUEEN AND A HOUSE OF
LORDS, AND ARK DISSATISFIED WITH EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY,
JEALOUS OF ALL WHO ARE BETTER OFF THAN THEMSELVES, AND ARK
ALWAYS TRYING TO ROB THEM OF THEIR PROPERTY, AND, IN FACT,
THEY 'RE A PACK OF INFERNAX ROGUES AND SCOUNDRELS!"
"AND WHICH ARE YOU, GRANDPAPA—A TORY OR A RADICAL?"
ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
MY BROTHER-IN-LAW.
(Continued.)
How is it, I bave often asked myself, that youngsters of a more
or less proved incapacity, turn, as a last desperate resort, to the
occupation and calling of a land-agent P The greatest thickhead in
the world, supposing him, |et us say, to fail after repeated attempts
to secure a Commission in Her Majesty's forces, will as a rule
tell you that there is something within him that makes him
certain he would shine in land-agency. He seems to imagine
that the business consists merely in riding good horses, in inter-
viewing an occasional refractory tenant, in shooting, and in pay-
ing visits to the Metropolis. Of the keeping of accounts, of
the orderly management of a great estate with the hundred
details that go to it he never thinks. Only let him be a land-
agent, and he sees himself fixed for life in comfortable quarters
with good food, and as little to do as is compatible with con-
tinued existence.
HARRY, at any rate, had no scruples of any kind. "My dear
old man," he had said, when I communicated Sir (¡REOORV'B
offer to him, "it's the тегу thing for me. I alway» told you
up in Yorkshire I'm a Dutchman." Thia leemed to me to be
hârdly the spirit in which such an offer should be accepted,
but the great point was that HARRT was disposed of, and there
was a reasonable hope that he might really do well in his new
position, and cease to be an incubus on me. There were juet
a few little bille, he had hinted, that he would like to pay off
before starting, so as to begin with a clear record. There was,
for instance, a rascally cigar merchant who had stuck him with a
cabinet of Cabanas, there was a clamorous jeweller who had made
a mean insinuation with regard to a writ, there were tailors,
bootmakers and haberdashers. The total staggered me, but
as this was really to be the last time, I resolved to pay and look
as pleasant as I could. ÂLIOB said I had acted as I ought to
act, and that it would have been a sinful thing to send the poor
boy to Yorkshire with a millstone of debt round his neck.
Thus handicapped, she declared, it would not be possible for
him to take a real interest in his new pursuit—besides, she had
read only last week a distressing account of a market-gardener
who had committed suicide because he couldn't pay his rent,
and she knew that HARRT had the proud and sensitive nature
which was peculiar to all the members of her family, and who
knew what might have happened if I had refused to pay. U it h
these and other arguments, all equally convincing and irresistible,
did my wife prove to me that I had in paying taken the only
course which was open to me as a gentleman and a brother-in-
law.
THUS HARRT set off for Halesworthy Hall, and for a time
everything seemed to be going well. Sir GREGORT was pleased,
HARRT was delighted, and a blessed feeling of relief pervaded
all my domestic arrangements. AIL this was much too good
to last, and accordingly, in the fourth month after HARRT'S de-
parture, I received from him the following rather startling
letter:—" Мт DEAR Том,—Don't be surprised at what I'm
going to tell you. The fact is, I never had an idea there was
going to be such a mortal lot of grind and sweat about this
blessed business. I don't get a single moment to myself, and I
had to chuck three good shooting invites all in one week because
there were estate accounts to be made up. I never was much
of a hand at figures, you know, and Sir GREGORT expects me
to know no end about heifers and sheep and things. So I 've
told him that for both our sakes I thought we had better part.
Of course I put it as nicely as possible so as not to hurt the old
boy's feelings, because he 's a good sort, though he doesn't know a
decent bottle of wine from rank poison, and smokes the beastli-
est cigars in the world. I shall be sorry to leave this place, for
there are some very jolly people about, and no end of pretty
girls, and the partridges this year are first-class; but after all
a fellow must deny himself something, so I 'm coming back in a
day or two. I hope you won't mind giving me the usual shake-
down till something else turns up. I Ve got my eye on two or
three things already. There 's a Bicycle Company they want
to shove me into as a director, but I haven't made up my mind
about it yet, as it wante some looking into. If it 's good I
shall join. I met a chap the other day who invented a new
pedal or something, and he 's made a Company of it, and they
tell me he's worth a hundred thou. That's the sort of thing
that would suit me down to the ground. Love to Аыся. By
the way, if you could lend me about a hundred I should be
awfully obliged. Things have been pretty expensive here in
one way and another. I 'm sure to be able to pay you back
before the end of the year as I 've got a couple of good young
horses that ought to fetch three times what I gave for them.
See you soon. Ever yours, HARRT.
P.S.—I 've got another bit of news for you that '11 make
you smile, but I '11 keep it till we meet."
FOUR days afterwards HARRT turned up sure enough, and in-
formed us, with the utmost cheerfulness, that he had been
privately married a fortnight ago to the eldest daughter of one
of Sir GREOORT'S tenante. "Simply a ripping girl," he said.
"Can play no end of good comic songs, rides like an angel, and
is as pretty as paint." But I didn't seem to be able to smile
as HARRT had expected.

as WORDSWORTH did on a September morn-

Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples Ho
Open unto the fields and to the sky,
ЛИ bright and glittering in the smokeless air.
Cab crossing bridge. After all, a little
late, better drive. Walk another time.
Hailed cab; man pulled up.
"'Ouse still a sittin'?" said cabby, with
gesture of elbow towards terrace, where
small ¡Tulips of Members strolled to and
fro sucking eggs.
"Yes," said M.P., pleased at this in-
terest shown in proceedings. "We Ve

"D'ye mean to sy," persisted cabby,

r> That 's about it," said M.P., smiling.
Without another word cabby jumped
down from his perch, made for balustrade
of bridge, and before M.P. quite knew
where he was he found himself holding on
to cabby's left leg, the other, and part of
cabby's body, being flung on opposite side,
plainly with suicidal intent.
"Most extraordinary sensitiveness on
part of cabman," M.P. said to SARK.
"Nothing to him personally, of course:
but mere idea of 670 more or less picked
men deliberately sitting up all night to
make laws for him, his family, and his
chums, suddenly striking him, temporarily
upset his brain, and he became possessed
by irresistible longing for oblivion. Touch-

cabman till a policeman saunters up.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

REMARKABLE ILLUSTRATION OF THE SPEEAD
OF CIVILISATION IN AFRICA.
SCARCELY FIGURES OF FUN.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—Everybody has a serious side to his cha-
racter, and I take it that your character (a most excellent speci-
men of the article) is not the one that proves the exception to
the rule. And this being so, I appeal to that side on a matter
of the greatest moment to myself and thousands of equally un-
fortunate ratepayers.
Most kind Sir, I live in a parish named after the patron saint
of my native land, with the addition of a well-deserved com-
pliment to the integrity (id est, the squareness) of the House
of Hanover. It is not because my dwelling is situated in this
"moet desirable neighbourhood" (as the estate agente describe
it) that I select it for notice, but because it is a fair sample of
many other localities equally favourable for letting purposes,
inclusive of that purpose which lets gold and silver out of the
pockets of the habitual residents. Once a year my Vestry send
me what they call "an important notice card." My Vestry, no
doubt firmly believing in my simplicity, give me not only the
dates when I must pay my quarterly rates, but casually inform
me that if I like I can pay the four quarters' rates in advance.
Having thus testified to a belief in my child-like innocence,
my Vestry take me into their confidence. My Vestry tell me
that they have estimated that the ratepavers will have during
the year 1896—97 to produce £493,639 9л. lOd.
On learning this, I naturally accept, with cordiality, the
9*. lOd., but kick at the odd, very odd balance of £493,639;
and, knowing that I will kick at it, my Vestry proceed to inform
me that "they have estimated that they will be called upon to
pay £397,658 4s. Id. towards expenditure over which they have
no control." Again, I make no fuss about the "four and a
penny," reserving my resentment for "the more than a third of
л million." By an act of arithmetic (showing what rapid strides
the School Board have been making) my Vestry come to the
conclusion that there will be a balance under their control of
£94,958 5s. 9d., which will go to pay "the deficiency of last
year," and " Paving, lighting, cleansing, watering, and mainten-
ance of roads, for local sewerage, sanitary expenses, Лс." No
doubt the "5s. i'd." will be exhausted by the a Ac."
Having given a general idea of the situation, my Vestry are
good enough to enter into particulars. They tell me that I
must pay 3s. 7d. in the £ for a Poor Rate, which covers all sorts
of strange items, including "police, and county rabee, and
charges under London Equilisation of Rates Act," and 1*. lOd.
for a General Rate. This latter takes 9|d. in the pound for
"General Vestry Purposes," and over a shilling for "School
Board Charges." Then, to make up my pleasant little "5s. od.
чп the pound," a penny is thrown in to defray the cost of the
Local Sewers' Rate. I don't mind the penny so much. It
would have been even welcome if it had come without ite irri-
tating five and fivepence. But, alas! it doesn't 1
But my Vestry are sympathetic. They say "that they much
regret the serious increase of threepence in the £ in the amount
of rates for the year." They explain that it is owing "to the
requirements of the L. С. С. and the School Board," which
they pathetically add "were largely in excess of the amounts
estimated." Then, as a sop to public opinion, they sternly in-
sist that "under no circumstances whatever are the men of the
Metropolitan Fire Brigade allowed to collect money." They
show by this fierce announcement that although they have no
control over the L. C. C. and the 8. C., they can at least " larn"
certain individuals what it is to be "men of the Metropolitan
Fire Brigade."
And with this declaration of their rather imperfect independ-
ence, they bring their "important notice card" to what, under
all the circumstances of the case, may be kindly called a spirited
conclusion.
Now, my dear Mr. Punch, I do not believe that my worth is
placed at too high a value by any one, but, for all that, I sign
myself, with confidence, AN OVER-RATED MAN.

JOTTINGS AND TITTLINGS.
(By BABOO HURRY BUNGSHO JABBKRJEE, B.A.)
No. XVII.
Containing same Miniate confidences from Mr. Jabberjee, with the explana-
tion of such apparent indiscretion. Also some notes on the Academy.
Никои к proceeding to set down sundry critical jots and tittles
upon the Royal Academical Picture Exhibition of current season,
I am about to whisper confidentially in the gentle ears of the
sympathetic reader certain particulars relating to this humble
ego of mine.
Since writing my latest contribution I have folded up my tent

"Unaccustomed toTdark-complexioned gentlemen."!
like an Arab, and silently moved away from Porticobello House,
this independent hook being taken under the ostensible and col-
ourable pretext of a medical opinion that the climate of Bays-
water was operating injuriously upon my internal arrangements,
but the real causa causant and dessous des cartes being a grow-
ing disinclination for the society of select male and female
boarders.
Miss JESSIMINA was naturally bathed in tears at the announce-
ment of my approaching departure, although I fondly sought to
console her by assurances that my residence in Highbury, Is-
lington, though beyond the radius and of inaccessible remote-
ness from Ladbroke Grove, should not obliterate her brilliant
image from the cracked looking-glass of my heart, and that I
would write to her with weekly regularity, and revisit the
glimpses of her moony presence at the first convenient oppor-
tunity.
I do correspond with effusiveness and punctuality through the
obliging medium of a young intimate Indian acquaintance of
mine, who does actually reside at Highbury, and has kindly
undertaken to forward my billets doux.
This stratagem is necessitated by the circumstance that (as a
matter of fact) I am dwelling under a rose at Hereford Road,
Westbourae Grove, which is in convenient proximity to Prince's
S(|u:iro and the stately home of the ALLBUTT-INNBTT family,
with whom I am now promoted to become the tame cat.
and back apartments at rupees fifteen per week and the Lady of
the Land has entreated me to kindly excuse the waiting-maid
for jumping with diffidence whenever I pop upon her unpre-
meditatedly on the stairs, being a nervous girl and unaccus-
tomed to dark-complexioned gentlemen—though, her own coun-
tenance, from superabundance of blacking and smuts, being of
a far superior nigritude, it is I myself who should be more justi-
fied in jumping.
However, she is already becoming the habituée, and seldom
drops the crockery-ware now—except when I simper with too
beaming a condescension.
Certain of my readers will perhaps hold up the hands of
amazement at my imprudence in disclosing my whereabouts, and
other private concerns, in the publicity of a popular periodical
—but there is method in such madness; they do not take in
Punch at Porticobello House, considering that one penny (or
even the moiety of that sum) is more correct value for
funny and comical illustrated journalism, while the ALLBUTT-
INNETTS, although they see I'utn-h weekly do not peruse the
literary contents, especially in the season, when, as Mrs. A. I.
frequently remarks, they are in such a constant whirl of social
dissipation that they have absolutely no time for serious reading.
At first I was severely mortified that—so far as my acquaint-
ances were concerned—these tittlings and jottings should be
thus written with water, but I have since made the discovery
that my cloud of disappointment is internally lined with precious
silver.
Now I will proceed with the criticism of the Royal Academy,
to which I lately escorted Miss WEB-WEB and her elegant
Mamma. I shall not deny that I was pleased with the majority
of the pictures, which are of a magnificent newness and
brilliancy, and in frames gilded with a lavish superbitude. But,
being many thousand in number, it is obviously beside the
question that I am to mention each individually in praise or
blame, and I can only single out a few—rari nantes in gurgite
vasto—and at the hasard of Hap.
There was a representation of the "Besieged City of Mansovl,"
apparently in India, and bombarded by Hon'ble HUN VAN in the
Holy War, according to the index. Not being desirous of
seeming the ignoramus in Miss WEB-WEE'S eyes, I averred that
I knew it well, and it was captured in the Indian Mutiny, where
one of my relations had highly distinguished himself by his
official fidelity to the Government.
In No. 3 Gallery there was a picture which Mrs. A. I. -aid we
must not forget to look at, being one of the pictures of the
year, and purchased by a request from the Court of Chancery.
It was entitled "The Man mth the Scythe," though by far the
raoet conspicuous characters consisted of a woman and a small
feminine child asleep in a chair. My companions agreed that
the title was enigmatic, but Mrs. A. I. observed that the child
was of a delicate appearance.
Another subject was called "The Confession," and presented
an individual of a careworn and conscientious type cloaking his
eyes with his fingers, while unfolding the harrowing tale of his
misdemeanours to a very beautiful but sickish young lady, who
was listening with a very proper expression of shocked and fas-
cinated disapproval. But, with all humility, I would suggest
that the interest of the picture would be greatly promoted by
the Catalogue containing some more definite details of the sin
which formed the head and front of his offending.
In No. 6 Gallery was a very fine portrait of a nun in the act
of genuflection under a tree, with a good and bad angel in the
background. Speaking for this poor self, I did consider the bad
angel the more attractive in comeliness of the couple, though
Miss WEE-WEE made a smiling reproach of my naughtiness in
expressing such a preference.
The adjoining gallery contained a picture which Mrs. A. I.
said we must be sure to remember to stop at, being the depict-
ment of the funeral of RICHARD THE THIRD. However, she was
of the opinion that for so lugubrious a subject it was not suffi-
ciently sombre, as it wae notorious that crimson was not correct
Court mourning. Regarding Queen ANNE, I suspect that she
has been considerably flattered by the painter, as I have always
understood that she was elderly and of a pursy habit, and by no
means as pretty as paint. But the painter was probably
of the gallant opinion that de mortuis nil nisi bonum.
I was greatly entertained by a picture called "Alone," which
showed a senile gentleman of rather greedy disposition, who
had stolen slyly back with some dogs at the conclusion of a ban-
quet for the purpose of finishing up the leavings, &c.
Also I noticed a curious painting of a youthful connubial

in blowing large bubbles from a email kind of open boat during
tempest. This was shortly called "Whither f" Now Dayus
sum, non Œdiput (if I hare employed this particular classical
quotation supra, its adaptability and universal popularity with
scholars must excuse me), but to such a question—the party
being totally deficient in oars and sails, and (ho vessel being
further impeded by nude characters of both sexes who were en-
endeayouring to upset it—the answer must infallibly be: To
DAVY JONES'S locker 1
Another equally fanciful subject was the delineation of a mer-
maid at the bottom of the sea, who was serving several fishes
with drink out of a shell. Now it is indubitably the case that a
fish is used as a synonym for a thirsty—but surely it ie opposed
to common sense to suppose that creatures who are naturally
surrounded by unlimited liquid should be under the necessity to
sip such refreshment from a shell I
As Mrs. AI.I.BI: iT-I.vNKTT remarked, and I had the honour to
concur, it is pitiable that artiste should select such impossible
subject« as the two above-mentioned, and should take so little
pains to observe Naturel
But in one particular I can cordially commend the conduct of
the Academy at this Exhibition—they have generously with-
drawn their clause insisting upon the deposit of all sticks, um-
brellas, et hoc genus omne.
This is Enlightenment and real Artistic Progress, and I will
venture confidently to predict that it will increase their receipt
of custom.
A FLY ON THE WHEEL.
(By Mr. Punch's Опт Interviewer.)
"AND how about the railway race to John o' Groats P" I said,
as I introduced myself to the cheery skipper of the Starboard
route, and fell unasked into his favourite arm-chair.
"Race?" he answered, "what race P Know nothing of any
race on our line. Tell me all about it."
"There is a popular impression," I replied, "that you and the
Larboard line propose to resume your go-as-you-please contest.
That, no doubt, is false. But you will admit that last season
your John o' Groats Through Scorcher was getting a little pre-
vious in its arrival."
"A faint rumour of this scandal did indeed reach me," he
admitted. "But. in the first place, it is not true that we ever
raced; and, in the second place, the Larboard began it. We
aimed simply to reach the irreducible medium of friction, and to
perfect our system of punctuation. We have arranged this
year to have only one full stop, and that at the end. For the
rest, there will be but two commas and a semicolon."
"Race or no race," I said, "may I ask whether you are
conscious of an irresistible public feeling in favour of being
turned out on a hard Gaelic platform three-and-a-half hours
before breakfast-time?"
"You would never believe," he replied, "how strong a sport-
ing instinct lies latent in the breast of the British passenger.
Among busy men who cannot get away from town for more than
one consecutive day, there is a growing demand for an hour or
two with the grouse at John o' Groats. It is for these that we
hope to cater. In the old system, the morning up-train was
timed to leave the north long before the arrival of the down.
By a careful economy of time, and a more free use of the finer
varieties of train-oil, we expect to obtain so handsome a margin
on the right side, that a keen sportsman, leaving London the
night before, may walk over a moderately-sized moor on the ex-
treme confines of the Highlands, bag a brace or so before the
birds are really awake, and get back to town in time to eat them
at dinner in the very bosom of liis family. And all within
twenty-four hours."
"But your locomotives," I interrupted, "will they not suffer
from what I may perhaps call the prolonged strain of this Sturm
und Drang?"
"On the contrary," he answered; "we shall have fresh relays
posted along the route. The same machinery—a sort of glori-
fied mail-catcher—that picks the old engine off the line will drop
a brand new one in its place. We hope, also, to obviate the
difficulty of refreshmente in the following way. By an ingeni-
ous arrangement of troughs (the Larboard, I may say, will have
nothing like it) our passengers will be enabled to lap up buns
and things while the train still urges on its unbridled career. A
member of our personnel will be present to check off the amount
consumed.

THIS SIR. MAKES YOU FEEL AS IF YOU 'D LIKE YOUR BODY IN A

None of ours so much as approach the perpendicular. I may
tell yon, in confidence, that a rise of even two feet in three is
a strain upon the most willing of locomotives, even when
followed only by a second locomotive, two tenders, and a go-
cart, the best possible combination for an ideal train."
"If," I said, "you will pardon a suggestion from a mere lay-
man, it has often seemed to me that needless friction is caused
by allowing the wheels to come in contact with the metals.
Would it not be feasible to ignore the rails altogether, or only
bring the train to ground occasionally for the purpose of correct-
ing any lateral aberration Ï"
"You may be sure," he affably replied, "that this happy idea
of yours has not escaped our consideration. By another season
we hope to have made experiments in that direction as well as
in the use of pneumatic tyres for minimising the shock of these
intermittent descents. At present we are engaged over another
problem, namely, the best method of dealing with the signal-
man of the Auld Lichte Junction, where the Starboard and
Larboard routes converge. It will be within your memory,
that one night last year he ran us heavily into a siding while
he put the others through. He may or may not have had a
trifle on the result. We are anxious, however, not to dispense
altogether with signals, as they give employment to a deserving
class, and are a popular source of confidence.

to which I lately escorted Miss WBE-WEB and her elegant
Mamma. I shall not deny that I was pleased with the majority
of the pictures, which are of a magnificent newness and
brilliancy, and in frames gilded with a lavish superbitude. But,
being many thousand in number, it is obviously beside the
question that I am to mention each individually in praise or
blame, and I can only single out a few—rari nantes in gurgite
vasto—and at the hazard of Hap.
There was a representation of the "Besieged City of Mansoul,"
apparently in India, and bombarded by Hon'ble BUNYAN in the
Holy War, according to the index. Not being desirous of
seeming the ignoramus in Miss WKB-WBB'S eyes, I averred that
I knew it well, and it was captured in the Indian Mutiny, where
one of my relations had highly distinguished himself by his
official fidelity to the Government.
In No. 3 Gallery there was a picture which Mrs. A. I. -aid we
must not forget to look at, being one of the pictures of the
year, and purchased by a request from the Court of Chancery.
It was entitled "The Man vñth the Scythe," though by far the
most conspicuous characters consisted of a woman and a small
feminine child asleep in a chair. My companions agreed that
the title was enigmatic, but Mrs. A. I. observed that the child
was of a delicate appearance.
Another subject was called "The Confession," and presented
an individual of a careworn and conscientious type cloaking his
eyes with his fingers, while unfolding the harrowing tale of his
misdemeanours to a very beautiful but sickish young lady, who
was listening with a very proper expression of shocked and fas-
cinated disapproval. But, with all humility, I would suggest
that the interest of the picture would be greatly promoted by
the Catalogue containing some more definite details of the sin
which formed the head and front of his offending.
In No. 6 Gallery was a very fine portrait of a nun in the act
of genuflection under a tree, with a good and bad angel in the
background. Speaking for this poor self, I did consider the bad
angel the more attractive in comeliness of the couple, though
Miss \\'Ь;Е-\\КГ made a smiling reproach of my naughtiness in
expressing such a preference.
The adjoining gallery contained a picture which Mrs. A. I.
said we must be sure to remember to stop at, being the depict-
ment of the funeral of RICHARD THE THIRD. However, she was
of the opinion that for so lugubrious a subject it was not suffi-
ciently sombre, as it was notorious that crimson was not correct
Court mourning. Regarding Queen ANNB, I suspect that she
has been considerably flattered by the painter, as I have always
understood that she was elderly and of a pursy habit, and by no
means as pretty as paint. But the painter was probably
of the gallant opinion that de mortuis nil nisi bonum.
I was greatly entertained by a picture called "Alone," which
showed a senile gentleman of rather greedy disposition, who
had stolen slyly back with some dogs at the conclusion of a ban-
quet for the purpose of finishing up the leavings, &c.
Also I noticed a curious painting of a youthful connubial

in blowing large bubbles from a small kind of open boat during
a tempest. This was shortly called " Whither! ". Now Daws

quotation supra, its adaptability and universal popularity with
scholars must excuse me), but to such a question—the party
being totally deficient in oars and sails, and the vessel being
further impeded by nude characters of both sexes who were en-
endeavouring to upset it^-the answer muet infallibly be: lo

Another equally fanciful subject was the delineation of a mer-
maid at the bottom of the sea, who was serving several fishes
with drink out of a shell. Now it is indubitably the case that a
fish is used as a synonym for a thirsty—but surely it is opposed
to common sense to suppose that creatures who are naturally
surrounded by unlimited liquid should be under the necessity to
sip such refreshment from a shell!
As Mrs. AÍLBUTT-INNBTT remarked, and I had the honour to
concur, it is pitiable that artiste should select such impossible
subject« as the two above-mentioned, and should take so little
pains to observe Nature I

as I introduced myself to the cheery skipper of the Starboard
route, and fell unasked into his favourite arm-chair.
"Race?" he answered, "what race? Know nothing of any
race on our line. Tell me all about it."
"There is a popular impression," I replied, "that you and the
Larboard line propose to resume your go-as-you-please contest.
That, no doubt, is false. But you will admit that last season
your John o' Groat« Through Scorcher was getting a little pre-
vious in its arrival."
"A faint rumour of this scandal did indeed reach me,
admitted. "But, in the first place, it is not true that we ever
raced; and, in the second place, the Larboard began it. We
aimed simply to reach the irreducible medium of friction, >"id to

year to have only one full stop, and that at the end.^ For the

conscious of an irresistible public feeling in favour of being

"You would never believe," he replied, "how strong a sport-

treme confines of the Highlands, bag a brace or so before the
birds are really awake, and get back to town in time to eat them

twenty-four hours."

difficulty of refreshment« in the following way. By an .ingeni-

nothing like it) our passengers will be enabled to lap up buns
and things while the train still urges on its unbridled career. A

JOTTINGS AND TITTLINGS.
(By BABOO HUKRY BUNGSHO JABBBRJEE, B.A.)
No. XVII.
Containing some intimate confidences from Mr. Jabberjec, with the explana-
tion of such apparent indiscretion. Also some notes on the Academy.
BEFORK proceeding to set down sundry critical jote and tittles
upon the Royal Academical Picture Exhibition of current season,
I am about to whisper confidentially in the gentle ears of the
sympathetic reader certain particulars relating to this humble
ego of mine.
Since writing my latest contribution I hare folded up my tent

"Unaccustomed toMark-complexioned gentlemen.'4
like an Arab, and silently moved away from Porticobello House,
this independent hook being taken under the ostensible and col-
ourable pretext of a medical opinion that the climate of Bays-
water was operating injuriously upon my interna! arrangements,
but the real causa causons and dessous des cartes being a grow-
ing disinclination for the society of select male and female
boarders.
Miss JESSIMINA was naturally bathed in tears at the announce-
ment of my approaching departure, although I fondly sought to
console her by assurances that my residence in Highbury, Is-
lington, though beyond the radius and of inaccessible remote-
ness from Ladbroke Grove, should not obliterate her brilliant
image from the cracked looking-glass of my heart, and that I
would write to her with weekly regularity, and revisit the
glimpses of her moony presence at the first convenient oppor-
tunity.
I do correspond with effusiveness and punctuality through the
obliging medium of a young intimate Indian acquaintance of
mine, who does actually reside at Highbury, and has kindly
undertaken to forward my billets doux.
Tins stratagem is necessitated by the circumstance that (as a
matter of fact) I am dwelling under a rose at Hereford Road,
Westbourne Grove, which is in convenient proximity to Prince's
Square and the stately home of the ALLBUTT-INNKTT family,
with whom I am now promoted to become the tame cat.
and back apartments at rupees fifteen per week and the Lady of
the Land has entreated me to kindly excuse the waiting-maid
for jumping with diffidence whenever I pop upon her unpre-
meditatedly on the stairs, being a nervous girl and unaccus-
tomed to dark-complexioned gentlemen—though, her own coun-
tenance, from superabundance of blacking and smute, being of
a far superior nigritude, it is I myself who should be more justi-
fied in jumping.
However, she is already becoming the habituée, and seldom
drops the crockery-ware now—except when I simper with too
beaming a condescension.
Certain of my readers will perhaps hold up the hands of
amazement at my imprudence in disclosing my whereabouts, and
other private concerns, in the publicity of a popular periodical
—but there is method in such madness; they do not take in
Punch at Porticobello House, considering that one penny (or
even the moiety of that sum) is more correct value for
funny and comical illustrated journalism, while the ALLBUTT-
INNITTS, although they see Punch weekly do not peruse the
literary contents, especially in the season, when, as Mrs. A. I.
frequently remarks, they are in such a constant whirl of social
dissipation that they have absolutely no time for serious reading.
At first I was severely mortified that—so far as my acquaint-
ances were concerned—these tittlings and jottings should be
thus written with water, but I have since made the discovery
that my cloud of disappointment is internally lined with precious
silver.
Now I will proceed with the criticism of the Royal Academy,
to which I lately escorted Miss WKK-WKK and her elegant
Mamma. I shall not deny that I was pleased with the majority
of the pictures, which are of a magnificent newness and
brilliancy, and in frames gilded with a lavish superbitude. But,
being many thousand in number, it is obviously beside the
question that I am to mention each individually in praise or

cinated disapproval. But, with all humility, I would suggest
that the interest of the picture would be greatly promoted by

angel the more attractive in comeliness of the couple, though

HOLIDAY THEORY AND PRACTICE.
[Dr. Louis ROBINSON, writing on "The Science
of Change of Air" in the National £evtetc, says
that the reason why a holiday change does so much
good Ы because man is naturally a nomad, and still
keeps up the wandering instincts of his hunting
ancestors.]

fact, he seems to have taken my ideas—

For Maiden just out.—Yes, sweetly pretty uniform. Dark blue
tunic with light blue overalls. Picturesque kepi. Perhaps they
are a little elderly, as they belong to the Veteran Company.
Most of them family men. Or at least, hare cousins and aunts.
Certainly are accompanied by their women folk. Don't know
much about them personally, but read an exhaustive descrip-
tion of them in the Daily Telegraph.
For Maiden very much out.—Most interesting. Recruited
from the best families in America. No doubt plenty of million-

that they will be glad to get back and settle at home.
For Wife of a Political .Economist.—Ought to do a great

of the English-speaking race. Most satisfactory that the ex-
pense is not thrown upon the rates. Not certain, however,
that ratepayers belonging to the H. A. C. of London will agree
with me.
For Wife of a Poet.—Charming idea altogether. Certainly
a subject for LONGFELLOW, or the only Englishman worthy to
wear his mantle. Quite a pity if the idea is anticipated by the
Poet Laureate. Should be more popular than Miles Standish.
Very touching, the rapprochement of the old and the new.

But discipline apparently slightly slack. The idea of the rank

generals had been made in tlmt fashion. Still, the force must
be meritorious because HER MAJESTY received them at Windsor.

THE MEETING OF THE (HARROGATE) WATERS.
A Tribute from One who has tried the-m.
AIR—MOORE'S "Meeting of the Waters."
THERE is not in old England a high land so sweet
As that plain where the Eighty (or more) Waters meet,
Oh I the last rays of feeling and Ufe must depart,
Ere the good that they did me shall fade from my heart.
I went there a wreck, with my liver all wrong,
And I left, in six weeks, feeling jolly and strong;
And whenever I 'in chippy I mean to go back
To the Old Sulphur Well and the guidance of BLACK.
Don't tell me of Homburg and Aix-la-Chapelle I
The waters of Schwalbach are all very well;
But on good 1 > irkshire soil 1 salvation have found.
And Harrogat j suits me right down to the ground.
Oh SLINOSBY of Knaresb'ro ! there 's many a saint
Whose halo seems dim and whose memory grows faint;
Who to canonisation had not as much right
As you, first spring-finder, and "eminent knight."
When you dropped—happy hour !—on that old Tewit Well—
(Led, no doubt, by the nose, for those waters it-ill smell)—
That chance treasure-trove did more good to the race
Than the quarry of which you were doubtless in chase.
Then they cleared off the Hewra-gate forest, and found
That Hygeia in Harrogate dwelt—underground;
And there the dear goddess resides to this day,
\\ ii bin hail of the Bog-Field, and sight of the Stray.
And there the (medicinal) waters meet still;
Coming goodness knows whence, threading grit-moor and hill,
And bright bubbling up through the grey and the green
In founts more health-giving than old Hippocrene.
There Sulphate, and Chloride, and Carbonate come,
With Ferruginous friend, and Chalybeate chum,
Whom a modern and myth-making Muse well might sing
As nymphs of the fountain and sprites of the spring.
But chemists have killed all our poesy out,
And Sodium Sulphydrate leaves fancy in doubt.
One would gladly indulge dithyrambical games,
Had they pleasanter odours, and prettier names.
But the strong sulphur water of Harrogate—pheughl I I
You can't call it sweet, if you care to be true.
A pint before breakfast, all hot from the spring,
Does not, at the moment, tempt poete to sing.
Yet Hylas—if "livery "—surely would find
These nymphs, if less sweet and seductive, more kind
Than those of Ionia, who stayed the boy's breath;
For Harrogate's naiads give life and not death.
And that 's why with lyrical fervour I greet
lhat sulphurous spot where the bright waters meet.
And why at the "Crown" in the Maytime I 'd dwell,
•\Yithin easy reach of the Old Sulphur Well.
Yet it is not that Nature has favoured the Stray,
That niggers there sing, and that minstrels there play;
"Fis not yon soprano so strident and shrill,
Oh no—it is something more exquisite still 1
'Tis that ROOSE, BLACK, and Sulphur, a trio most dear,
Restored me to health when I felt precious queer.
And I know how the best charms of Nature seem lost
When my mirror reflect« me a face like a ghost.
Sweet region of Sulphur I How calmly I rest
Since I drank of the waters which meet in thy breast.
My gratitude, Harrogate, never shall cease,
other body of citizens of the United States. Seem to be more
Since my gout seems all gone and my liver 's at peace.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, July 6.—
Pretty to see DON JOBB on Treasury Bench
just now whilst his esteemed colleague,
GBORGTB HAMILTON, was tracing all the
sorrows of the Soudan back to action of
Cabinet in 1880—85. In those far-off
days our Colonial Secretary was a
leading spirit in the Cabinet of Mr. G.
A Government—so G. H. described it—
responsible for the necessity, year after
year, of sending large expeditions to the
Soudan, leading to nothing but profitless
bloodshed, involving heavy burden alike
on Egyptian and British taxpayer. For-
tunately, at this moment, DON JOSE was
breast; faint smile hovering over gently
closed lips.
"Hushl" said SAHK, when I nudged
him, pointing, as did JOHN MORLEY a
little later with more emphatic gesture,
to propinquity of the Ministers. "You
know that pretty legend which explains
the cause of a babe sometimes smiling in
its sleep ?' The angels are talking to it'
they say. I think the angels are talking
to DON Jose."
Perhaps they were. All we heard was
GEORGIE HAMILTON uplifting his voice in
denunciation of the Cabinet of 1880—85.
And that, SARK admits, is quite another
thing.
JOHN MOBLEY, when he spoke, fitted the
cap on heads of DON JOSE and the
statesman who at the time alluded to was
Marquis of HARTINGTON, specially respon-
sible as Secretary of State for War for
operations in the Soudan. Duke of
DF.VONSHIHK, in accordance with his genial
habit, came in too late to hear this
passage. Was in his place over clock a
quarter of an hour later, in time to hear
ghosts of his former self summoned from
vasty deep of blue books to confront his
present colleagues, and condemn their
action in charging India with cost of
troops recruited for the Soudan. No one
looking at impassive face surveying House
from seat in gallery immediately over the
clock would imagine that its owner had
remotest interest in personage whose
written words were cited and commented
upon. The House, its interest quickened
by presence of the Duke whilst the Mar-
quis was quoted, pricked up ite ears.
His Grace, after listening for a while,
whenever JOHN MORLBY, mentioning
"Lord HARTINGTON," proceeded to quote
from his speeches or despatches. Soon
his head drooped on right shoulder. Con-
venient to his elbow was division of bench
between Peers' Gallery and that set apart
for Foreign Ministers. As J. M. continued,
the Duke laid his head on his hand, and
in full view of crowded House he slept—
slept so soundly, that, unlike his colleague
on Treasury Bench, he was undisturbed by
problematical visits from the angels, fi
on sultry July night House of Commons
cared to know what the Marquis of HAR-
TINGTON thirteen years aco said about wis-
dom and equity of charging on Indian re-
venue expenses of Indian troops serving
abroad, they might stay awake and listen.
As for the Duke of DEVONSHIRE, he public-
ly fell asleep.
Business done.—Attempt to relieve
India from Soudan war charges defeated
by majority of 85 in House of465.

shoulder to the door and help to drive the

It proved a night of disappointment.
First of all, enough to break spirit of

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, July 6.—
Pretty to see DON Joss on Treasury Bench
just now whilst his esteemed colleague,
GEORGIE HAMILTON, was tracing all the
sorrows of tin' Soudan back to action of
Cabinet in 1880-^. In those far-off
days our Colonial Secretary was a
leading spirit in the Cabinet of Mr. Q.
A Government—so G. H. described it—
responsible for the necessity, year after
year, of sending large expeditions to the
Soudan, leading to nothing but profitless
bloodshed; involving heavy burden alike
on Egyptian and British taxpayer. For-
tunately, at this moment. DON JOSE was
breast: faint smile hovering over gently
closed lips.
"Hush!" said Улик, when I nudged
him, pointing, as did JOHN MORLBY a
little later with more emphatic gesture,
to propinquity of the Ministers. "You
know that pretty legend which explains
the cause of a babe sometimes smiling in
its sleep ?' The angels are talking to it'
they say. I think the angels are talking
to DON JOSE."
Perhaps they were. All we heard was
GEORGIE HAMILTON uplifting his voice in
denunciation of the Cabinet of 1880—86.
And that, SABK admits, is quite another
thing.
JOHN MORLEY, when he spoke, fitted the
cap on heads of DON JOSE and the
statesman who at the time alluded to was
Marquis of HAKTINGTON, specially respon-
sible as Secretary of State for War for
operations in the Soudan. Duke of
DEVONSHIRE, in accordance with his genial
habit, came in top late to hear this
passage. Was in his place over clock a
quarter of an hour later, in time to hear
ghosts of his former self summoned from
vasty deep of blue books to confront his
present colleagues, and condemn their
action in charging India with cost of
troops recruited for the Soudan. No one
looking at impassive face surveying House
from seat in gallery immediately over the
clock would imagine that its owner had
remotest interest in personage whose
written words were cited and commented
upon. The House, its interest quickened
by presence of the Duke whilst the Mar-
quis was quoted, pricked up its ears.
Hi» Grace, after listening for a while,
whenever JOHN MORLEY, mentioning
"Lord HARTINGTON," proceeded to quote
from his speeches or despatches. Soon
his head drooped on right shoulder. Con-
venient te his elbow was division of bench
between Peers' Gallery and that set apart
for Foreign Ministers. As J. M. continued,
the Duke laid his head on his hand, and
in full view of crowded House he slept—
slept so soundly, that, unlike his colleague
on Treasury Bench, he was undisturbed bj
problematical visits from the angels. Й
on sultry July night House of Commons
cared to know what the Marquis of HAB-
TINGTON thirteen years ago said about wis-
dom and equity of charging on Indian re-
venue expenses of Indian troops serving
abroad, they might stay awake and listen.
As for the Duke of DEVONSHIRE, he public-
ly fell asleep.
Business done.—Attempt to relieve
India from Soudan war charges defeated

J. LOWTHER, standing at corner of bench

confine his remarks to certain narrow line.
JEMMY, in the largeness of his heart and

MY BROTHIB-IN-LAW.
(Concluded.')
WELL, there was no blinking the fact. HARRT was married,
and loud were the lamentations and indignant the snortings of
all his tribe of aunts when the news pervaded to their ears.
Now at last, they declared, the boy was ruined: all his pre-
vious escapades were merely the conventional sowing of wild
oate, from which a youth of his gifte, spirit and lineage might
have been expected to reap an abundant crop of success. But
this marriage- was too terrible. HARRY might have allied him-
self to rank and wealth, for a lad of his looks and family could
have aspired to any alliance outside the circle of royalty—but
a tenant farmer's daughter! No, the boy had made himself
impossible, and henceforth—so they affirmed in effect-—they were
no aunts of his.
HARRY took the ostracism decreed against him by his aunts
with perfect calmness. The old cats, he said, had never done
anything for him, and he didn't care two winks of a sparrow's
left eye-lid what they thought of his actions. If they didn't
care for his missus they would just have to lump it, and after
all, she could give the whole lot of them a hundred-weight and
a beating for looks and manners, and that was all he was going
to trouble his head about. So HARRY was codicilled out of
several wills, and accepted, with his wife, an invitation from
my wife to stay with us for a week or so while they looked out
for nice cheap lodgings in a quiet part of the town, and settled
what they were to do for a living. For ALICB, I must say,
behaved like an angel to her brother. "I will never give HARRY
up, no, never," were her words. "If he were to commit a
murder I would hide him, and now that he has really done a
more than ever. That girl will be the making of him, you '11
see if I'm not right. All he want« is a feeling of responsibility,
a sense that someone depends upon him, and who could give
him that better than a wife? You know how often you Ve
said yourself that you could never have got on without me,
though I 'm sure I know little enough of your horrid old law-
books, or your stupid cases—and I 'm sure it '11 be just the same
with HARRY, if we can only get him started. And with your
influence you must be able to get him something." Thus did
the wife of my bosom address winged words to me, and hence
it came that we shortly afterwards received the visit of the
young couple.
AND now, as Mr. RIDER HAOOARD says, a strange thing
happened. I must confess that I had looked forward with some
apprehension to my first meeting with Mrs. HARRY, and my
wife—though she would have gone to the stake, or suffered her-
self to be torn with red-hot pincers rather than admit it—was
not without her share of nervousness. For after all, when a
young man has never in his life deviated into a wise action, one
is not inclined to credit him with any special discernment in
so momentous a matter as the choice of a wife. And somehow
or other, the idea associated in my mind with a farmer's
daughter was of a clumsy, heavy, buxom, blooming, and not
too refined girl. But the reality was totally different. In
place of the common unpleasing vision we had conjured up we
saw a modest, charming, and extremely pretty girl, dressed
simply, but with perfect taste, and of a style of address and
manners that would have fitted her to take her place in any
society. After she had been with us for half an hour I was won
over to her side for good and all, and my wife, as she embraced
her for about the eighth time, cast a triumphant look at me,
as much as to say, "didn't I tell you so all along, and will you
ever dare to doubt my foresight again, and aren't you really
rather foolish ever to have thought ESTHER would be anything
bu t delightful?"
As for HARRY, he was fonder of his wife and prouder of his
own cleverness in having captured her than I could have con-
ceived it possible for so giddy and thoughtless a young man.
"Look here, old man," he said to me, with considerable
solemnity, "of course I know I've played the fool all my life,
but that 's over now. I 'm going to buckle to like beans, yon
see if I don't. Something must turn up, and whatever it is
I '11 take it, and ESTHER will help me, bless her heart, right
through. You don't know what ideas that girl has got, she 's
full of 'em. Why, I 'm a baby to her." Never was praise better
deserved, for certainly ESTHER was as practical as she was pretty
and fascinating, and her quiet influence began to have an ex-
traordinary effect on HARRY in curbing his extravagances, and
reducing his ideas to the level of his means.
I AM sorry to have to end this little story in a happy way—
but truth compels. The secretaryship of the Bucephalus Club
fell vacAnt about this time, and the Committee of that great
institution were inundated with applications for the post. It
had been my good fortune on one occasion to be able to render
a considerable service to the Bucephalus, and for some years
I had had a place on the Committee. I took up HARRY as my
candidate, worked for him, canvassed for him, wrote letters on
his behalf, and, in the result, secured his triumphant election.
The defeated minority hinted darkly at a job, but HARRY has
justified me and his other supporters. No better club secretary
exists. He is punctual, courteous, and a model of secretarial
industry, and, further than that, I don't suppose there is a
happier couple in London than HARRY and ESTHER. Their
wants are moderate and their means are sufficient. I do not
wish it to be inferred that I recommend everybody to get a
seemingly ne'er-do-well brother-in-law married to the daughter
of a tenant-farmer. All I can say, that in this particular case
the experiment has been an unqualified success, and must for
ever stand to the credit of womankind.
TRILBY'S poor tootsies have ceased to run on the boards of the
Haymarket, but she now reappears in a West Australian mining
venture, not in company with Svengali, but united to Little
Billee. The Mining Co. is known as "The Ivanhoe Consols
Amalgamated, Trilby, and Little Billee," so that О my eye
Trilby is in excellent company with THACKERAY'S Little Büke
and SCOTT'S 0-my-I-vanhoe. If "Our Trilby," or rather "Trilby
Mine" has the success of the book, the speculators will be
fine action, as well as a sensible one, I mean to stand by him
fortunate.

see if I don't. Something must turn up, and whatever it is
I '11 take it, and ESTHER will help me, bless her heart, right
through. You don't know what ideas that girl has got, she 's
full of 'em. Why, I 'm a baby to her." Never was praise better
deserved, for certainly ESTHER was as practical as she was pretty
and fascinating, and her quiet influence began to have an ex-
traordinary effect on HARRY in curbing his extravagances, and
reducing his ideas to the level of his means.
I AM sorry to have to end this little story in a happy way—
but truth compels. The secretaryship of the Bucephalus Club
fell vacant about this time, and the Committee of that great
institution were inundated with applications for the post. It
had been my good fortune on one occasion to be able to render
a considerable service to the Bucephalus, and for some years
I had had a place on the Committee. I took up HARRY as my
candidate, worked for him, canvassed for him, wrote letters on
his behalf, and, in the result, secured his triumphant election.
The defeated minority hinted darkly at a job, but HARRY has
justified me and his other supporters. No better club secretary
exists. He is punctual, courteous, and a model of secretarial
industry, and, further than that, I don't suppose there is a
happier couple in London than HARRY and ESTHER. Their
wants are moderate and their means are sufficient. I do not
wish it to be inferred that I recommend everybody to get a
seemingly ne'er-do-well brother-in-law married to the daughter
of a tenant-farmer. All I can say, that in this particular case
the experiment has been an unqualified success, and must for
ever stand to the credit of womankind.
TRILBY'S poor tootsies have ceased to run on the boards of the
Haymarket, but she now reappears in a West Australian mining
venture, not in company with Svengali, but united to Little
flillee. The Mining Co. is known as "The Ivanhoe Consols
Amalgamated, Trilby, and Little Billee," so that О my eye
Trilby is in excellent company with THACKERAY'S Little Bilke
and SCOTT'S 0-my-l-vanhoe. If "Our Trilby," or rather "Trilby
Mine" has the success of the book, the speculators will be
fortunate.

Did Committee suppose that having pre-
pared lecture nearly an hour lone, taking
as text particular amendment on the paper,
that because amendment not mured his
speech would not be made P If he might not
deliver it on amendment being moved, he
would set forth every word of it on motion
for leave not to move amendment.
In this effort grievously hampered by
action of kinsman in the Chair. Time was
when the LOWTHERS all hung together—at
least, as many of them as were caught by
gentry in whose cattle they had taken a
personal interest. Now, J. W. LOWTHER,
in Chair of Committee of Ways and Means,
from time to time interrupted speech of
J. LOWTHER, standing at corner of bench
below Gangway, and insisted he should
confine his remarks to certain narrow line.
JEMMY, in the largeness of his heart and
fulness of his knowledge, wanted to range
all over the tea table. J. W. said he must
strictly confine his attention to his own
particular cup of tea. Ribald House up-
roariously laughed when from time to time
the LOWTHER in the chair solemnly rose
and in gravest voice called to order the
LOWTHER below the Gangway.
JEMMT an old Parliamentary hand;
knows all the ropes; intimately acquainted
with procedure. Finding one hole stopped,
the old fox got away in another direction.
Sight of COURTNEY reminded him of Cob-
den Club dinner. Cobden Club suggested
Free Trade. Why not discuss speeches

in tropical heat, he, in the very wanton-
ness of luxury, pulls his trowser well up
the length of his wooden leg, and smiles at
the Chairman of Ways and Means.
The CAP'EN, whose knowledge of finance
is extensive and peculiar, has taken active
part in debate on Budget now drawing to
its close. On Clause 16, which exempts from
estate duty works of art which appear to
the Treasury to be of scientific interest, he
posed Committee with suggestion that

My book lies idly upon my knee,
And I hardly pretend to read,
For the flower is all I care to see—
Though I also love the weed.
If to burn and be burnt be the heart's de-

Then mine is fulfilled indeed;
For the flower sets all my heart on fire,
While I—set fire to the weed!
And "Dick, you old chimney, that's

I hear, yet I do not heed;
But I smile at the flower that smiles at
me
Through the smoke of the burning weed.
So I while the summer hours away.

And the only boon from the Fates I pray

And the place for burning weeds!

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
MY BROTHKR-IN-LAW.
(Concluded.')
WELL, there was no blinking the fact. HARRY was married,
and loud were the lamentations sand indignant the snortings of
all his tribe of aunts when the news pervaded to their ears.
Now at last, they declared, the boy was ruined: all his pre-
vious escapades were merely the conventional sowing of wild
oate, from which a youth of his gifte, spirit and lineage might
have been expected to reap an abundant crop of success. But
this marriage was too terrible. HARRY might have allied him-
self to rank and wealth, for a lad of his looks and family could
have aspired to any alliance outside the circle of royalty—but
a tenant farmer's daughter! No, the boy had made himself
impossible, and henceforth—so they affirmed in effect—they were
no aunts of his.
HARRY took the ostracism decreed against him by his aunts
with perfect calmness. The old cats, he said, had never done
anything for him, and he didn't care two winks of a sparrow's
left eye-lid what they thought of his actions. If they didn't
care for hie missus they would just have to lump it, and after
all, she could give the whole lot of them a hundred-weight and
a beating for looks and manners, and that was all he was going
to trouble his head about. So HARRY was codicilled out of
beveral wills, and accepted, with his wife, an invitation from
my wife to stay with us for a week or so while they looked out
for nice cheap lodgings in a quiet part of the town, and settled
what they were to do for a living. For ALICE, I must say,
behaved like an angel to her brother. "I will never give HARRY
up, no, never," were her words. "If he were to commit a
murder I would hide him, and now that he has really done a
fine action, as well as a sensible one, I mean to stand by him
more than ever. That girl will be the making of him, you '11
see if I'm not right. All he wan te is a feeling of responsibility,
a sense that someone depends upon him, and who could give
him that better than a wife? You know how often you Ve
said yourself that you could never have got on without me,
though I 'm sure I know little enough of your horrid old law-
books, or your stupid cases—and I 'm sure it '11 be just the same
with HARRY, if we can only get him started. And with your
influence you must be able to get him something." Thus did
the wife of my bosom address winged words to me, and hence
it came that we shortly afterwards received the visit of the
young couple.
AND now, as Mr. RIDER HAGGARD says, a strange thing
happened. I must confess that I had looked forward with some
apprehension to my first meeting with Mrs. HARRY, and my
wife—though she would have gone to the stake, or suffered her-
self to be torn with red-hot pincers rather than admit it—was
not without her share of nervousness. For after all, when a
young man has never in his life deviated into a wise action, one
is not inclined to credit him with any special discernment in
so momentous a matter as the choice of a wife. And somehow
or other, the idea associated in my mind with a farmer's
daughter was of a clumsy, heavy, buxom, blooming, and not
too refined girl. But the reality was totally different. In
place of the common unpleasing vision, we had conjured up we
saw a modest, charming, and extremely pretty girl, dressed
simply, but with perfect taste, and of a style of address and
manners that would have fitted her to take her place in any
society. After she had been with us for half an hour I was won
over to her side for good and all, and my wife, as she embraced
her for about the eighth time, cast a triumphant look at me,
as much as to say, "didn't I tell you so all along, and will you
ever dare to doubt my foresight again, and aren't you really
rather foolish ever to have thought ESTHER would be anything
but delightful?"
As for HARRY, he was fonder of his wife and prouder of his
own cleverness in having captured her than I could have con-
ceived it possible for so giddy and thoughtless a young man.
"Look here, old man," he said to me, with considerable
solemnity, "of course I know I 've played the fool all my life,
but that 's over now. I 'm going to buckle to like beans, you
see if I don't. Something must turn up, and whatever it is
I '11 take it, and ESTHER will help me, bless her heart, right
through. You don't know what ideas that girl has got, she 's
full of 'em. Why, I 'm a baby to her." Never was praise better
deserved, for certainly ESTHER was as practical as she was pretty

traordinary effect on HARRY in curbing his extravagances, and
reducing his ideas to the level of his means.

JOTTINGS AND TITTLINGS.
(By Влвоо HuiutY BUNOSHO JADBEIUEK, В.Д.)
No. XVIII.
Mr, Jabbcrjee is a ¡title over-ingenious in his excuses.
SINCE shaking the dust off my feet at Porticobello House, I
have not succeeded to pluck the courage for a personal interview
with Miss JKSSIMINA, and my correspondence, duly forwarded
per Mr. BHOOBONB LALL JALPANYBHOY, of Highbury, has con-
sisted mainly of abject excuses for non-attendance on plea of
over-study for Bar Exam, and total incapacity to journey due
to excessive disorderliness in stomach department.

"Ascended his bicycle with_a waggish winkle iii his eye."
This, unhappily, at length inspired her with the harrowing
dread that I was on the point of being launched into the throes
of eternity, if not already as dead as Death's door-nail, and so,
with feminine want of reflection, she performed a hurried pil-
grimage to Highbury.
Now, whether on account of the beetleheadedness of a
domestic, or Baboo JALPANYBHOT'S incompetency in the art of
equivocation, I am not to say—but the sequel of her inquiries
was the unshakable conviction that I had not struck root in the
habitation from which my letters were ostensibly addressed.
And in a subsequently forwarded letter she did reproach me
pathetically with my duplicity, and accused me of being a fickle
—by which I was во unspeakably cut up that I abstained from
the condescension of a rejoinder.
Next I became the involuntary recipient of another letter in
more intemperate style, menacing me that with a hook or u
crook, she would dislodge me from the loophole in which I was
snugly established, und that several able-bodied boarders were
the hue of a full cry in pursuit.
Since Hereford Road is in dangerous proximity to Ladbroke
Grove, I was sitting tight in my apartments on receipt of this
grave intelligence, with funk in my heart, and the Unknown
hovering above me, when my young friend HOWARD ALLBUTT-
INNKTT, Esq., arrived with his bicycle, like a god on a machine,
and, perceiving the viridity of my countenance, inquired sym-
pathetically what was up.
At first, being mindful of the excessive liveliness with which
he had bantered my residence in a boarding-house of such
mediocre pretensions, I was naturally disinclined to reveal that
I was in the plight of troth with the proprietress's daughter;
kettle of fish of my infandum dolorem, and my ardent longing
to hit upon some plan to extricate myself from the suffocating
coils of such a Laocoon.
"My dear old chap," he said, kindly, after I had unfolded the
last link of my tale of woe, "I will put you up in a dodge that
will perform the trick. Don't see the young woman, or she
will get round you with half a jiffy. Write to her that you are
not worthy of a rap, and no more a Prince than I am!"
Hearing his last words, I started, and did, like the ghost of
Hamlet, Senior, "jump at this dead hour," being convinced
that young HOWAED had found out (perhaps from Hon'ble
CUMMERBUND) that my title was a bogus, and anticipating that,
if he divulged the skeleton of my bare cupboard to his highly
genteel parente, I should infallibly experience the crushing
mortification of a chuck out.
However, I hid the fox that was nibbling my vitals by in-
quiring, in a rather natural accent, what he meant by such a
suggestion.
"Are you such an innocent, simple old Johnny, Prince?" he
said, with reassuring bonhomie, "as not to catch the idea. Do
you not know that European feminines in all ranks of society—
alack, even in our own !—are immoderately attracted by anyone
possessed of riches and a title—or of either of the two? As an
a« fait in the female temperament, I shall wager that it is nine
out of ten that if you spoof this mercenary young minx into
believing that you are merely a native impecunious nonentity,
and not to be shot at with powder, she will instantaneously
drop pursuing such a hot potato."
To this speech (reported verbatim to best of my ability) I
did shake my head sorrowfully, and reply that I greatly feared
that JESSIMINA'S devotion to this unlucky self was too severe to
be diverted, or even checked, like a cow that is infuriated cr
non compos mentis, by the mere relinquishment of such tinsel
and gewgaw wraps as a title or worldly belongings, having fre-
quently (and that, too, prior to our engagement) protested her
preference for very dark-complexioned individuals, and her
vehement curiosity to behold India.
But he, as he ascended his bicycle with a waggish winkle in
his eye, repeated that I might try it on at all events.
Si ill, I could not induce myself to adopt his spoofish strategy,
for I reflected that, though it might convince her that I was
unmarriageable, it would only increase her fury- and the
vengeance of her champion boarders. So at length I composed
a moving epistle, as follows :—
INCOMPARABLE—THOUGH T.ACKADAISY! INACCESSIBLE—JESSIMINA!
Poet SHAKSPEARE has shrewdly observed that "a true lover
never did run a straight course," and the sincerity of present
writer's affection is incontestably proved by his apparent crooked-
ness of running, and keeping dark outside the illuminating
rays of thy moon-like countenance. The cause is the unforeseen
cataclysm of a decree from my family astrologer or dowyboghee,
whom I have anxiously consulted upon our joint matrimonial
prospects. [Мкм. то THE READERS.—This was what young
HOWARD would term "the bit of spoof." I am no ninnyhammer
to consult an exploded astrologer ! ] Miserabile dictu! the
venerable and senile pundit reports that such an alliance would
infallibly plunge us into the peck of troubles, since the sign of
your natal month is the meek and innocent Lamb—while mine
is the more ferocious Lion I
A very slight familiartity with Natural History, «fee., will show
you the utter incompatibility of temper between such an un-
congenial couple of animals, and the correctness of said astrolo-
ger's prediction that it must infallibly be the Lamb who would
be whiphanded in the unequal conflict.
In consequence, though I am beating the floor with my head
as I write, and moistening the carpet with the copiousness of
my lachrymations, I must bid you the final and irrevocable
adieu and au revoir, since I am unwilling to act as a selfish.
Think of me as "a prince out of thy star," to quote the reference
of SHAKSPEARH'S character, Polonius, to Hamlet, under pre-
cisely similar circumstances. You will please forget me
instanter, and accept this as my last solemn so-long, which I
utter on the threshold of preparation for the stern and dreaded
ordeal of Bar Exam. In frantic haste,
Your ever faithful and broken-hearted Baboo, HURRY.
P.S.—No answer required.
But after an interval of a very few posts, in spite of my strict
injunctions to contrary, I got the answer that she was deeply
touched by my self-eacrifice, and had never loved me more.
Having be'en brought up in a Christian disbelief of all astro-
nomy, she was not in fear of my "dowybogey" or any other
but eventually I overcame my coyness, and uncovered the pretty
oativ« bogies, and nothing should part us, if she could help it.

No. XVIII.
Mr. Jabberjtc is a little over-ingenious in his excuses.
SINCE shaking the dust off my feet at Porticobello House, I
have not succeeded to pluck the courage for a personal interview
with Miss JESSIMINA, and my correspondence, duly forwarded
per Mr. BHOOBONB LALL JALPANTBHOT, of Highbury, hae con-
sisted mainly of abject excuses for non-attendance on plea of

"Ascended his bicycle with_a waggish winkle in hie eye."
This, unhappily, at length inspired her with the harrowing
dread that I was on the point of being launched into the throes
of eternity, if not already as dead as Death's door-nail, and so,
with feminine want of reflection, she performed a hurried pil-
grimage to Highbury.
Now, whether on account of the beetleheadedness of a
domestic, or Baboo JALPANYBHOY'S incompetency in the art of
equivocation, I am not to say—but the sequel of her inquiries
was the unshakable conviction that I had not struck root in the
habitation from which my letters were ostensibly addressed.
And in a subsequently forwarded letter she did reproach me
pathetically with my duplicity, and accused me of being a fickle
—by which I was so unspeakably cut up that I abstained from
the condescension of a rejoinder.
Next I became the involuntary recipient of another letter in

JOTTINGS AND TITTLINGS.
(BY BABOO HUKKY BUNGSHO JABDERJEE, B.A.)
No. XVIII.
Mr. Jabberjee is a lulle over-ingenious in his excuses.
SINCE shaking the dust off my feet at Porticobello House, I
have not succeeded to pluck the courage for a personal interview
with Miss .IKSSI.MINA, and my correspondence, duly forwarded
per Mr. BHOOBONB LALL JALPANYBHOY, of Highbury, has con-
sisted mainly of abject excuses for non-attendance on plea of
over-study for Bar Exam, and total incapacity to journey due
to excessive disorderliness in stomach department.

"Ascended his bicycle with_a waggish winkle in his eye."
This, unhappily, at length inspired her with the harrowing
dread that I was on the point of being launched into the throes
of eternity, if not already as dead as Death's door-nail, and so,
with feminine want of reflection, she performed a hurried pil-
grimage to Highbury.
Now, whether on account of the beetleheadedness of a
domestic, or Baboo JALPANYBHOY'S incompetency in the art of
equivocation, I am not to say—but the sequel of her inquiries
was the unshakable conviction that I had not struck root in the
habitation from which my letters were ostensibly addressed.
And in a subsequently forwarded letter she did reproach me
pathetically with my duplicity, and accused me of being a fickle
—by which I was so unspeakably cut up that I abstained from
the condescension of a rejoinder.
Next I became the involuntary recipient of another letter in
more intemperate style, menacing me that with a hook or a
crook, she would dislodge me from the loophole in which I was
snugly established, und that several able-bodied boarders were
the hue of a full cry in pursuit.
Since Hereford Road is in dangerous proximity to Ladbroke
Grove, I was sitting tight in my apartments on receipt of this
grave intelligence, with funk in my heart, and the Unknown
hovering above me, when my young friend HOWARD ALLBUTT-
INNETT, Esq., arrived with his bicycle, like a god on a machine,
and. perceiving the viridity of my countenance, inquired sym-
pathetically what was up.
At first, being mindful of the excessive liveliness with which
he had bantered my residence in a boarding-house of such
mediocre pretensions, I was naturally disinclined to reveal that
I was in the plight of troth with the proprietress's daughter,
kettle of fish of my infandum dolorem, and my ardent longing
to hit upon some plan to extricate myself from the suffocating
coils of such a Laocoon.
"My dear old chap," he said, kindly, after I had unfolded the
last link of my tale of woe, "I will put you up in a dodge that
will perform the trick. Don't see the young woman, or she
will get round you with half a jiffy. Write to her that you are
not worthy of a rap, and no more a Prince than I am!"
Hearing his last words, I started, and did, like the ghost of
Hamlet, Senior, "jump at this dead hour," being convinced
that young HOWARD had found out (perhaps from Hon'ble
CUMMERBUND) that my title was a bogus, and anticipating that,
if he divulged the skeleton of my bare cupboard to his highly
genteel parente, I should infallibly experience the crushing
mortification of a chuck out.
However, I hid the fox that was nibbling my vitals by in-
quiring, in a rather natural accent, what he meant by such a
suggestion.
"Are you such an innocent, simple old Johnny, Prince?" he
said, with reassuring bonhomie, "as not to catch the idea. Do
you not know that European feminines in all ranks of society—
alack, even in our own !—are immoderately attracted by anyone
possessed of riches and a title—or of either of the two? As an
au fait in the female temperament, I shall wager that it is nine
out of ten that if you spoof this mercenary young minx mto
believing that you are merely a native impecunious nonentity,
and not to be shot at with powder, she will instantaneously
drop pursuing such a hot potato."
To this speech (reported verbatim to best of my ability) I
did shake my head sorrowfully, and reply that I greatly feared
that JESSIMINA'S devotion to this unlucky self was too severe to
be diverted, or even checked, like a cow that is infuriated cr
non compos mentis, by the mere relinquishment of such tinsel
and gewgaw wrnpg as a title or worldly belongings, having fre-
quently (and that, too, prior to our engagement) protested her
preference for very dark-complexioned individuals, and her
vehement curiosity to behold India.
But he, as he ascended hie bicycle with a waggish winkle in
his eye, repeated that I might try it on at all events.
Still, I could not induce myself to adopt his spoofish strategy,
for I reflected that, though it might convince her that I was
unmanageable, it would only increase her fury- and the
vengeance of her champion boarders. So at length I composed
a moving epistle, as follows :—
INCOMPARABLE—THOUGH LACKADAISY 1 INACCESSIBLE—JESSIMINA!
Poet SHAKSPEARE has shrewdly observed that "a true lover
never did run a straight course," and the sincerity of present

Stantea in puppibua altia
the coxswains swayed the yoke-lines of their frail galleys, and
urged their crews to renewed efforts. As the witty French
marquis put it on a celebrated occasion, "rien succède comme le
tuccès," and no saying of greater aptness can be drawn from the
"arcana" of "res gestee." My congratulations go to the "Novi-
collegians" not less than to the tried and trusted representa-
tives of the "premier" Metropolitan Boat Club on a splendid
race. But "rerennns à nos moutons."
Egad the "Antipodean" wielders of the willow go from
strength to strength. 'Tis not easy to see why foolish carpers1
should ever have set them down as an aggregation lacking in any
of the necessary merits of a magnificent team of first-class
"dry-bobs." 'Twill be remembered, that from the beginning
I never held with such, but cautioned our cricketers against the
national vice of under-estimating the market value of their
doughty antagonists from the "under-world." Still, with our
veteran champion and such "sports" as the dusky little Prince
"RANJIB," we can "take up arms against a sea of troubles," and
by giving them the necessary opposition, bring them without
difficulty to a satisfactory termination. So mote it be. And
here a whisper in your ears, good Sirs. Whatever may betide,
play the game as 'twas handed down to us by our sires.
Of many other notable events I must speak anon.

"FIFTY LITTLE DOCTOR BOYS."
[" Fifty young doctors have started work in the tenement-house district ol
New York, under direction of the Board of Health. They are part of the
usual summer c-oqw of physicians who are instructed to look out for violations
of the sanitary laws. "—Evening Paper.]
YOUTHFUL New York medicos, zealous, smart, and fifty,
Told the slum folk how they could be good, and clean, and
thrifty.
Several street larrikins much preferred being naughty—
Hurled some half-bricks jovially—and then there were forty.
Other aborigines resented being called dirty—
Rolled the doctors in the mud—and then there were thirty.
To each Sawbones quoth his friend—"Mind, festina lente!"
But a whiff of lively germs reduced their ranks to twenty.
Twenty leeches with their lancets bled some Irishmen
Coming straight from Tammany—and then there were ten.
For their fees—in gold—the ten did their patrons dun;
The Silverites got hold of them—and then there was none!

TROUBLE TO ASPIRATE!"
A CASE FOR SIR JOHN LUBBOCK.
DEAR MB. PUNCH,—I know that you have a tender heart, and
therefore I implore you to bring my sad complaint to the notice
of the public, who, I believe, buy your paper. I don't always,
for I read your charming effusions at the most convenient Free
Library. But the Free Libraries are of no use to me in my
distress, which is, that last Wednesday evening I arrived at
Richmond (in Surrey, not Yorkshire) and wanted to buy some
comestibles for dinner, but, alas! was unable to do so owing to
an early closing movement, of which I was quite unaware, as I
had just come from Harlesden, where the same idea prevails
on Thursday. To-morrow (Friday) I am going to Staines, and
possibly this day may be selected by the inhabitants for their
weekly junketings.
I really cannot object to the young men and women, who so
courteously attend to our wants, appropriating every sixth day
as well as Sunday for their amusement, but I do ask their em-
ployers round about London to fix on the same date for this re-
laxation. Then, again, I notice that the butchers—always so
prodigal of fat and bone—have apparently formed an association
for putting up their shutters on Mondays. Is this because New
Zealand lamb and mutton are not delivered on Sunday? I have
no wish to offend the susceptibilities of these gentlemen, or,
indeed, of any other traders, but a little time-table of their
various movements would be so convenient to
Your faithful servant,

Were meet companions of cigars;
When cigarettes were voted trash
Not worthy of cremation's ash;
When meerchaum's coloured face evoked

When Latakia's fragrant bloom
Would mix with bird's eye's rough per-

Here is the fragrant jewelled pipe
Whose stem exhales the "cherry ripe,"
Whose amber mouth-piece back to me
Brings kisses of a Northern She!
And here the merry black dhudeen—

And there that hookah's fatal coil
Reminds me how my blood would boil
To see you flirt 1 What futile trouble,

With silken cord and golden lace,
A kind of net that held me, dear,
For just a quarter of a year.

And knew in smoke it told of love,
An emblem of the purest heart—

MY VERT DEAR SIR,—I hope you will not be surprised at
receiving a letter to which so suggestive a signature as the one
I have adopted is attached. I would respectfully remind you
that in your youth you were a member of the profession to which
I have the honour to belong. I think I may safely say that we
both were ornaments to our calling. You represented the old
school with your baton and fun, while I suggest the new with
my skeleton keys and courtliness.
I write to you to propose that the companions of our frater-
nity should take a leaf from the note-books of our foreign col-
leagues, and imitate them in politeness.
I will assume that a successor to CLAUDE DUVAL (a most
charming person, but, unfortunately, of French origin) wishes
to enter a house with a view to replenishing his empty coffers
in the customary fashion. With a proper regard to avoiding
giving unnecessary trouble to the servants, he passes the front
door without either ringing the bell or knocking. Of course,
as his visit will be paid at night, when the household will be
asleep, if he can come and go without attracting attention, so
much the better. But should he be so unfortunate as to dis-
turb the master of the mansion, then he should show that he
was capable of being as considerate as businesslike.
"Pray do not be alarmed," he would reply, in answer to a
question relative to his business to be present; "I will not stay
and any cash that may be lying about. If you kindly give me
your keys, I think the incident will pass off quite pleasantly."
If the master of the mansion is unreasonable, and threatens
an alarm, then the visitor would have to adopt a sterner tone.
"Pardon me, but I think it only right to warn you that I
carry a revolver. I would most reluctantly put you to personal
inconvenience, but if you force me to shoot you I must."
Then while the visitor was searching the safes and emptying
the cash-box he might carry on an interesting conversation with
the master of the mansion, discussing the rise and fall of shares,
were his involuntary host a stock-broker, or ecclesiastical archi-
tect if he happened to be a bishop.
"And now I think I will look into the library," the visitor
would вау, "and pray let me know if there are any volumes—
such as school prizes and the like—that you would wish me to
exempt from my seizure. Believe me, I am not grasping, and
appreciate the claims of sentiment."
Thus, what is coarsely called "house-breaking," might be
refined into a really inoffensive, if not absolutely pleasant, occu-
pation .
And now I have to ask your pardon twice. I will beg of you
to allow me to conceal my address, as I have no wish to give
unnecessary trouble to the authorities of New Scotland Yard.
Secondly, I would apologise for withholding my real name—as
again I have no desire to put the police on the alert. You will
allow, however, that the nom de guerre I append, if imaginary,
is, at any rate, refined and appropriate. Yours faithfully,

IT is sad to think that Weir of Hermiston (CHATIO AND
WINDUS) should be added to the list of works which, like
Edvin Drood, and the unfinished window in Aladdin's Tower,
unfinished must remain. If STEVENSON had made choice
of the moment at which he should lay down his pen,
he could scarcely have bettered that to which the finger of
Fate pointed. As be confesses in various letters, he held this
last book to be his best. It is not seemly to dispute with the
dead, and the legacy is rich enough to gratify any taste. In
the editorial note (a difficult piece of work admirably done) Mr.
SYDNEY COLVILK sketches, upon the authority of the novelist,
the course he had intended the story should run. It is a power-
ful plot, though my Baronite thinks the conclusion of Archie and
Kirstie marrying after all, and going off to America, common-
place to the point of anti-climax. Had he lived, STEVENSON
would doubtless have devised something better than that.

Edvnn Drood, and the unfinished window in Aladdin's Tower,
unfinished must remain. If STEVENSON had made choice
of the moment at which he should lay down his pen,
he could scarcely have bettered that to which the finger of
Fate pointed. As he confesses in various letters, he held this
last book to be his best. It is not seemly to dispute with the
dead, and the legacy is rich enough to gratify any taste. In
the editorial note (a difficult piece of work admirably done) Mr.
SYDNEY COL VILE sketches, upon the authority of the novelist,
the course he had intended the story should run. It is a power-
ful plot, though my Baronite thinks the conclusion of Archit and
Kirstie marrying after all, and going off to America, common-
place to the point of anti-climax. Had he lived, STEVENSON
would doubtless have devised something better than that.

RIP woke up with a start. He looked around him, and found
a solitary individual watching him.
"Where am I?" was his natural question after his long rest.
"The same old place," was the quiet reply.
"Dear me!" said RIP. "It seems to me, stranger, that you
speak the American language with a very English accent."
"Because I happen to be an Englishman."
Then RIP asked after a number of his old friends. He was
fairly intelligent, and allowed for a generation or two, and took
an interest in their descendants.
"Some of them been to Henley!" he exclaimed. "And others
to London I How 's that?"
Then the Englishman informed him that the Ancient and Hon-
ourable Artillery Company of Boston had joined their comrades,
the Honourable Artillery Company of London, and that the Vale
Boys had been on the banks of the Thames
"Then," concluded the Britisher, "there's an American
school-boy cricketing eleven playing a series of matches against
their cousins on the European side of the Atlantic."
"Well, to be sure!" cried RIP. "We all seem to be going
back to the old country."
"Yes," acquiesced the stranger. "There are a tidy number
of Americans in Great Britain just now."
"Well, I shall go myself," said RIP. "Come with me."
"Well, thanks, no," answered the Englishman. "As all your
people have left your country uncared for, I may just as well
keep an eye on it until they come back again."
"That 's what I call neighbourly," cried RIP.

thousand strong at least, who, by the
magic of a short service system were ready
to man more ships than could be built
at Chatham Dockyard, even when CHARLIE
BERESFORD was in command. At question

he thought of it.
"If," answered JOKIM, evidently struck

slight additional cost, and without im-

discomfited.

tion of Ireland always invested with pe-
culiar interest for the wandering Saxon.
Years ago, Sir PAT O'BRIEN, now gatherec
to his fathers among the earlier kings oi
Ireland, alluded to an hon. Member oppo-
site as "the young sea serpent from
County Clare." SPEAKER objected on
point of order. "Then; Sir," said PAT,
with gracious wave of his hand, "I with-
draw the sea serpent."
In later Parliaments, County Clare
maintains its pre-eminence of peculiarity
by continuing to send WILLIE REDMOND
to Westminster. To-night more is heard
of County Clare, deepening Chief Secre-
tary's interest in his forthcoming visit.
It appears that through vast tracts of the
country is upheaved a backbone of rock
on which famishing cattle graze, off which
a starving peasantry scrape the mere
crumbs of a living. To-night in Com-
mittee on Irish Land Bill TIM HEALY
moves amendment designed to obtain for
those grim wastes, locally known as crag
or mountain farms, such benefits as the
Bill confers. Attorney-General for Ire-
land put up to answer TIM with legally
phrased non possumus. It's all a matter
of intention, he argued. If a crag farm
be let for pasture purposes, it will, ipso
facto, come within scope of the Bill. If
not, it is already excluded. "All a mat-
ter of intention," he repeated.
"What!" cried TIM, in tone of magni-
ficent scorn, going, as usual, straight to
heart of matter, piercing trappings of
legal subtlety, "does the hon. and learned
gentleman mean to say that any one
intended to be born in County Clare?
Committee broke into quick burst of
laughter at the quaint fancy underlying
this flash of humour, with its picture of
the unborn babe surveying Ireland, de-
bating with itself whether it would be
born in County Clare, or whether it would
favour some other locality. The Member
for Sark, who chances to be in grave
mood, says the conversation, interpolated
for a few minutes in a long night of
wrangling, shows afresh how close are the
sources of tears and laughter. To his
mind, nothing has brought home more
sharply the hopeless difficulty of the Irish
question than this limelight view, mo-
mentarily cast on walls of House of Com-
mons, of the crag farms of cruel County
Clare, a district of which Cromwellian
settlers bitterly said it had not wood
enough to hang a man withal, water
enough to drown him, or earth enough to
bury him.
liitsinrss done.—In Committee on Irish
Land Bill.
Friday.—Another night with Ireland.
Proceedings disclosed fresh injustice to
that hapless country. As TIM HBALY was
discussing Education Vote his eye acci-
dentally fell on figure of CORPORAL НА.Ч-
BUHY, half asleep on Treasury Bench op-
posite. Occurred to him he would call
him "ВАНАВВЛЯ." No particular reason
why he »hould; but name came to his
lips; so ho out with it
What does Chairman do but call him to
order!
TIM, above all things logical, poses
Chairman with question. "The Secre-
tary for the Colonies," he said, "was
allowed to call Mr. GLADSTONE 'HBROD.'
Wliy should I not call Mr. HANBURT
'BARABBAS '?"
Why not? Or, to put it in another
way, why .should he? Chairman, at loss
for answer on same strictly logical lines,
should withdraw "BABABBAS," which after
a struggle he did. But the whole thing
showea how uneven-handed is justice in
House of Commons, how there is one law
for rich England and another for poor
Ireland.

SCENE—Examination Room; high, long, dirty
windows; smell of ancient whitewash; Ex-
aminers at green-baize table consult conflict-
ing notes; solitary clmir posing in centre;
pale clock ticking laboriously. Enter sud-
denly astvlc youth, broad chest, broad face,
broad boots. Examiners hastily conceal notes
and reflect, with, much gravity.
Senior Examiner (sternly, to astute
youth). You wish, I understand, Sir. to be
further examined — (pompously) — for the
higher posts of your profession?
Astute Candidate (acquiring chair).
That is so.
¿>. E. (wisely). Ah! Well — er— (con-
sulting notes)—you are steaming ten knots,
head to wind—er, on the port tack, that
is—when suddenly, as the fog lifts, you
see a large rock, right a-head. What do
you do?
A. C. I should stop the engines.
S. E. Yes. (Acutely.) But suppose
the engines are unmanageable, and will
not stop?
A. C. (hesitatingly). Oh! well, in that
case, I should of course instantly with-
draw my previous order and allow them
to—er—continue to revolve!
[Examiners smile approvingly.
S. E. Precisely. That is a clever an-
swer. But remember you are nearing the
rock; what will be the next order?
Л С!, (wildly). Hard-a-port.
,4. E. Why a-port?
Second Examiner (waking up, sud-
denly). Why not?
.S. R. (hurriedly, glaring at. Second
Examiner). Oh!—er—yes; hard-a-port;
quite so, exactly. But your rudder, at
this juncture, unfortunately becomes im-
moveabln; what then?
A. C. Well, then—(hedging)—I should
endeavour to do my duty by acting as cir-
cumstances might dictate.
N. E. Benring in mind?
A. C. That by every effort in my
power I must endeavour to avoid the
rock.
S. E. Do you then consider that, tinder
the circumstances, there would be the
smallest chance of your being able to
ffect this?
A'. E. That is very good. Yon seem to
have entirely mastered the situation.
You run, then, on to the rock. What
will bo your next duty?
A. C. To close the water-tight doors.
S. E. Why do this?
A. C. To keep the water in.
S. E. In?
A. C. Exactly so.
S. E. (sarcastically). In what?
A. C. (promptly). In the sea.
S. E. What would chiefly impel yon to
take this course?
A. C. My knowledge of physics, which
teaches me that no body of water, how-
ever large, can be in more than one
place at one time.
S. E. How would this knowledge influ-
ence your action?
A. C. It would confirm me in the be-
lief that if the water were kept in the
sea it could not at the same time be in
the ship.
S. E. A water-tight door, then, is
never regarded as having kept water out (
A. C. Never among seamen.
S. E. And the theory that water-tight
doors are useful for keeping water oui
may be regarded as exploded?
A. C. Entirely.
S. E. Ah! that is very satisfactory.
(Pause.) Well, now, Sir, suppose you are
in a sailing vessel that will neither wear
nor stay, on a lee-shore in a gale of wind.
What would you do?
A. 0. Let go an anchor.
»S. E. But your cable parts; what would
you do then?
A. C. Let go another anchor.
S. E. But the bottom is rocky, and you
find no holding ground; what then?
A. C. (rising slowly from his chair). I
should then endeavour to compose my-
self to sleep.
.S. E. (hard on scent, and not noticing
movement). But, owing to the noise occa-
sioned by the storm and the excessive
motion of the vessel, you find that you
cannot sleep. What would you do?
A. C. (desperately, and backing out of
room). Sing a little hymn.
S. _E. But, my dear young Sir, your
anguish of mind is such that you cannot
even remember a little hymn. What
would you do thenf
A. C. (disappearing through door). Let
her go ashore and be d d.
S. E. But suppose 'M, thank you.
That is very satisfactory indeed.

REAL HOLIDAY THOUGHTS.
IN A EAILWAY CARRIAGE,
PREPOSTEROUS of guard to put more
than one person in a second-class car-
riage in weather like this. Yet if I had
tipped him, he would have locked it like
a shot. Railway company ought to nut
down such bare-faced corruption. Rather
wish I had tipped him. now.
Anyhow, it is consoling to think that
my Gladstone bag. on the seat beside me
—and which I shall not move —makes
that jackass who has just got in tho-
roughly uncomfortable.
My moral right to turn an ordinary
ccmpartment into a private saloon car-
riage would be recognised by every tra-
veller who was really я gentleman.
Why that selfish, long-legged idiot
opposite me, who looks like a half-starved
"scorcher," won't keep his splay feet
under his seat so as to allow me room to
stretch my legs, I can't imagine.
Papers are cheap, so I shan't offer that
consumptive-looking female in the corner
one of mine. She should get one for her-
self. -
Wish I hadn't accepted this invitation
to those stupid bores, my Folkestone
cousins, for a "fortnight at the sea-side."
They ought to be jolly grateful for my
condescension in visiting them.
In going through that long tunnel, I of
course put up my window, but people at
other end left theirs open! Lazy smoke-
cured pigs!
By her movements I am positive that
the lady with all the packages is going to
get out at the next station. Must he

I shall be obliged to soil my hands and
make myself still hotter by opening the
door for her. i

wiches and a 'flask 1 Why can't his master
arrange to keep him at school all the holi-
days—with canings twice a day? What
humbug it is giving boys any holidays!
Guard (the beast!) has shoved in a rank
third-classer at last moment! I admire the
democracy in the abstract, of course, but
that does not prevent my thinking them
loathsome and disgusting nuisances in the
concrete. Thank heaven! He has taken
his seat next to the consumptive female,
not to me.
(At the end.) How completely incon-
siderate it was of any of the people who
have been my travelling companions to-
day ever coming into existence at all!
Con. for a Cricketer.
Miss NELLY site cool in the cricketer's
booth,
And watches the game, about which, in
good sooth,
Her curious interest ne'er ceases.
She now wants to know of the flannel-

However the wickets can well be kept
smooth,
When she hears they are always
in creases!

[JULY 25, 1896.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
tion of Ireland always invested with pe-
culiar interest for the wandering Saxon.
Years ago, Sir PAT O'BRIEN, now gatherec
to his fathers among the earlier Kings ol
Ireland, alluded to an hon. Member oppo-
site as "the young sea serpent from
County Clare. SPEAKER objected on
point of order. "Then? Sir," said PAT,
with gracious wave of his hand, "I with-
draw the sea serpent."
In later Parliaments, County Clare
maintains its pre-eminence of peculiarity
by continuing to send WILLIB REDMONI
to Westminster. To-night more is heard
of County Clare, deepening Chief Secre-
tary's interest in his forthcoming visit.
It appears that through vast tracts of the
country is upheaved a backbone of rock
on which famishing cattle graze, off which
a starving peasantry scrape the mere
crumbs or a living. To-night in Com-
mittee on Irish Land Bill TIM HE AI. v
moves amendment designed to obtain for
those grim wastes, locally known as crag
or mountain farms, such benefits as the
Bill confers. Attorney-General for Ire-
land put up to answer TIM with legally
phrased non possumus. It's all a matter
of intention, he argued. If a crag farm
be let for pasture purposes, it will, ipso
facto, come within scope of the Bill. If
not, it is already excluded. "All a mat-
ter of intention," he repeated.
"What!" cried TIM, in tone of magni-
ficent scorn, going, as usual, straight to
heart of matter, piercing trappings of
legal subtlety, "does the hon. and learned
gentleman mean to say that any one
intended to be born in County Clare?
Committee broke into quick burst of
laughter at the quaint fancy underlying
this flash of humour, with its picture of
the unborn babe surveying Ireland, de-
bating with itself whether it would be
born m County Clare, or whether it would
favour some other locality. The Member
for Sark, who chances to be in grave
mood, says the conversation, interpolated
for a few minutes in a long night of
wrangling, shows afresh how close are the
sources of tears and laughter. To his
mind, nothing has brought home more
sharply the hopeless difficulty of the Irish
question than this limelight view, mo-
mentarily cast on walls of House of Com-
mons, of the crag farms of cruel County
Clare, a district of which Cromwellian
settlers bitterly said it had not wood
enough to hang a man withal, water
enough to drown him, or earth enough to
bury him.
BusinfM done.—In Committee on Irish
Land Bill.
Friday.-—Another night with Ireland.
Proceedings disclosed fresh injustice to
that hapless country. As TIM HBAI.T was
discussing Education Vote his eye acci-
dentally fell on figure of CORPORAL HAN-
BURY, half asleep on Treasury Bench op-
posite. Occurred to him he would call
him "BARABBAS." No particular reason
why he should; but name came to his
lips; so he out with it
What does Chairman do but call him to
order!
TIM, above all things logical, poses
Chairman with question. "The Secre-
tary for the Colonies," he said, "was
allowed to call Mr. GLADSTONE 'HEROD.'
Why should I not call Mr. HANBUHY
'BARABBAS'?"
Why not? Or, to put it in another
way, why should he? Chairman, at loss
for answer on same strictly logical lines,
should withdraw "BARABBAS," which after
a struggle he did. But the whole thing
showea how uneven-handed is justice in
House of Commons, how there is one law
for rich England and another for poor
Ireland.
Business done. — Irish votes in Com-
mittee.

SCIENCE AT SEA.
[Report of higher viva voft examination for rank
of muster.]
SCENE—Examination Boom; high, long, dirty
vrindows; smell of ancient whitetpash; Ex-
aminers at green-baize table consult conflitt-
iiig notes; solitary cluiir posing in centre;
pale clock ticking laboriously. Knier sud-
denly astute youth, broad chtst, broad face,
broad boots. Exam iners hastily conceal notes
and reflect with much gravity.
Senior Examiner (sternly, to astute
youth). You wish, I understand, Sir. to be
further examined—(pompously)—for the
higher posts of your profession?
Astute Candidate (acquiring chair).
That is so.
S. E. (wisely). Ah! Well — er— (ron-
snliing noies)—you are steaming ten knots,
head to wind—er, on the port tack, that
is—when suddenly, as the fog lifts, you
see a large rock, right a-head. What do
you do?
Л. C. I should stop the engines.
S. E. Yes. (Acutely.) But suppose
the engines are unmanageable, and will
not stop?
A. C. (hesitatingly). Oh! well, in that
case, I should of course instantly with-
draw my previous order and allow them
to—er—continue to revolve!
[Examiners smile approvingly.
S. E. Precisely. That is a clever an-
swer. But remc-mber you are nearing the
rock; what will be the next order?
Л Г,, (wildly). Hard-a-port.
.S'. E. Why a-port?
Second Examiner (waking up, sud-
dr.tily). Why not?
.S. R. (hurriedly, glaring at Second
Examiner). Oh!—er—yes; hard-a-port;
quite so, exactly. But your rudder, at
this juncture, unfortunately becomes im-
moveabln: what then?
A. C. Well, then—(hedging)— I should
endeavour to do my duty by acting as cir-
cumstances might dictate.
,S. E. Bonring in mind?
A. C. That by every effort in my
power I must endeavour to avoid the
rock.
S. E. Do you then consider that, under
the circumstances, there would be the
smallest chance of your being able to
effect this?
¿>. E. That is very good. You seem to
have entirely mastered the situation.
You run, then, on to the rock. What
will be your next duty?
A. C. To close the water-tight doors.
S. E. Why do this?
A. C. To keep the water in.
S. E. In?
A. C. Exactly so.
S. E. (sarcastically). In what?
A. C. (promptly). In the sea.
S. E. What would chiefly impel yon to
take this course?
A. C. My knowledge of physics, which
teaches me that no body of water, how-
over large, can be in more than one
place at one time.
S. E. How would this knowledge influ-
ence your action?
A. C. It would confirm me in the be-
lief that if the water were kept in the
sea it could not at the same time be in
the ship.
S. Ê. A water-tight door, then, is
never regarded as having kept water out f
A. C. Never among seamen.
S. E. And the theory that water-tight
doors are useful for keeping water out
may be regarded as exploded?
A. C. Entirely.
S. E. Ah! that is very satisfactory.
(Pause.) Well, now, Sir, suppose you are
in a sailing vessel that will neither wear
nor stay, on a lee-shore in a gale of wind.
Whiit would you do?
A. C. Let go an anchor.
<S. E. But your cable parts; what would
you do then?
A. C. Let go another anchor.
<<?. E. But the bottom is rocky, and you
find no holding ground; wlmt then?
A. C. (rising slowly from his chair). I
should then endeavour to compose my-
self to sleep.
.Si. E. (hard on scent, and not noticing
movement). But, owing to the noise occa-
sioned by the storm and the excessive
motion of the vessel, you find that you
cannot sleep. What would you do?
A. C. (desperately, and backing out of
room). Sing a little hymn.
S. E. But, my dear young Sir, your
anguish of mind is such that you cannot
even remember a little hymn. What
would yon do then?
A. C. (disappearing through door). Let
her go ashore and be d d.
.<?. E. But suppose . 'M, thank you.
That is very satisfactory indeed.

Mem.—Full marks.
"A BOON AND A BLESSING."—It is well
known to all readers of DICKENS that
"Todgers's could do it when it liked," and
so can the L. C. & D. line when it is
really in enrnest about whisking the jaded
Londoner down to Ramsgate, dropping
passengers at important intermediate
stations, as it now does by starting from
Holhorn at 5.10, St. Paul's at 5.12, and
reaching the breezy coast at the sensible
hour of 7.5, punctually, giving landsman
and yachtsman ample time for a stroll
before dinner at 8. This is doing us all a
e;ood "Service," and one which should
bring in "L. S. D." to the "L. C. A D."
MUSICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL.—Among
the first pieces played by the Austro-
Hungarian Orchestra was SMBTANA'S Der
Kuss (The Kiss). It needs no German to
tell us that "the kiss" is not infrequently
took refuge in authority. Insisted TIM
looked back upon as "the kuss."
A. C. (decidedly). Not the slightest.

L'ART D'ETRE PETIT-FILS.
•GRANDPA, DEAR—IF I WERE YOU I'D SAY 'THAT BOY LOOKS THIN AND PALE!' AND
I 'D GET HIM A POXY.";
REAL HOLIDAY THOUGHTS.
IN A EAILWAY CARRIAGE.
PREPOSTEROUS of guard to put more
than one person in a second-class car-
riage in weather like this. Yet if I had
tipped him, he would have locked it like
a snot. Railway company ought to put
clown such bare-faced corruption. Rather
wish I had tipped him. now.
Anyhow, it is consoling to think that
my Gladstone bag. on the seat beside me
—and which I shall not move —makes
that jackass who has just got in tho-
roughly uncomfortable.
My moral right to turn an ordinary
compartment into a private saloon car-
riage would be recognised by every tra-
veller who was really a gentleman.
Why that selfish, long-legged idiot
opposite me, who looks like a half-starved
"scorcher," won't keep his splay feet
under his. seat so as to allow me room to
stretch my legs, I can't imagine.
Papers are cheap, so I shan't offer that
consumptive-looking female in the corner
one of mine. She should get one for her-
self. ^
Wish I hadn't accepted this invitation
to those stupid bores, my Folkestone
cousins, for a "fortnight at the sea-side."
They ought to be ¿oily grateful for my
condescension in visiting them.
In going through that long tunnel, I of
course put up my window, but people at
other end left theirs open! Lazy smoke-
cured pigs!
By her movements I am positive that
the lady with all the packages is going to
get out at the next station. Must be
deeply occupied with a leading article, or
I shall be obliged to soil my hands and
make myself still hotter by opening the
door for her.
The corner youth has brought out sand-
wiches and a flask! Why cant his master
arrange to keep him at school all the holi-
days—with canings twice a day? What
humbug it is giving boys any holidays!
Guard (the beast !) has shoved in a rank
third-classer at last moment! I admire the
democracy in the abstract, of course, but
that does not prevent my thinking them
loathsome and disgusting nuisances in the
concrete. Thank heaven! He has taken
his seat next to the consumptive female,
not to me.
(At the end.) How completely incon-
siderate it was of any of the people who
have been my travelling companions to-
day ever coming into existence at all!
Con. for a Cricketer.
Miss NELLY site cool in the cricketer's
booth,
And watches the game, about which, in
good sooth,
Her curious interest ne'er ceases.
She now wants to know of the flannel-
clad youth,
However the wickets can well be kept
smooth,
When she hears they are always
in creases!
NOTE BY OUR MAN our OF TOWN.—
Watering places—resorts where the visi-
tor is pumped dry.
SPORTIVE SONGS.
A Man-about-Toi/m in enthralled by a Clergy-
man's Daughter at a Country File.
FOR me no damsel prone to frown
On simple manners, country ways,
Whose chief delight is life in Town.
And Bond Street goal of all her days!
Whose knowledge of all sylvan scenes
Is bounded by the Goodwood boughs,
And deems seafaring pleasure means
To lounge upon the Lawn at Cowes.
Give me the girl bred up like you,
Beneath a Rectory's peaceful shade,
With many friends, yet known to few,
The model of an English maid!
Demure, not prim, beloved by all,
By instinct good, by nature kind,
The belle of every county ball,
Yet dear to every village hind!
How quaint to watch your artless airs
When circled round by ardent swains!
Your modesty disarms their stares,
Their compliments are empty strains!
I do not blame their boorish bliss,
_'Tis meet that such a farce should be,
Since I've the greatest joy in this—
Your sweetest smiles are kept for me!
Too well, Blue Eyes, I understand
The glances from those bashful orbs.
You're treading on a sinking sand
That quakes and shivers, then absorbs.
Ah! little innocent, too late
The truth you '11 know, but never rue.
I vow I cannot overrate
The interest I take in, yon.
"What Jones I" (a brutal Army thing).
"So glad!" (of him I hate the sight).
"Yes! come to hear FLO FANTAIL sing
'Miss Peccadillo's Last Good Night!'"
"Which is the songstress?" "There she
is!
Not seen her? Why, she's all the
rage!"
"That lady there?" "Yes I A1 biz."
"A parson's daughter on the stage!"

PLAYING WITH COLD WATER.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—May I make a suggestion? During the
hot weather, why should not those of our dramatic companies
still sojourning in London remove from their present quarters
to the swimming baths? There would be plenty of room to rig
up a stage, and the audience, appropriately garbed, might
watch the performance from the tank. When a play became
wearisome the spectators could take a dive, but plunges, of
course, would only be allowed between the acts. Your»
sincerely, A PITITB IN A MELTING MOOD.
P.S.—With the thermometer at ninety something in the shade,
I may insist that only managers need keep their heads above
water.

JOTTINGS AND TITTLINGS.
(Вт BABOO Никит Виновно JABBERJEE, В.А.)
No. XIX.
Mr. Jabberjee iría a fresh tack. His visit to the India Office and
sympathetic reception.
IN my last I had the honour to report the total non-success of
my endeavour to nill my betrothal on plea of astrological ob-

"Pitch it strong, my respectable Sir."
jections, and how I was consequentially up the tree of Embarrass-
ment.
I have since resolved that honesty is my best politics, and have
confessed to Miss MANKLETOW in a well-expressed curt letter
that I am only the possessor of a courtesy title, and, so far from
rolling on the rosy bed of unlimited rhino, am out of elbows,
and dependent upon parental remittances for pin-money.
For corroboration of said statements I begged to refer her
politely to my benevolent friend and patron, Hon'ble Sir
( Y.MMKKIH NU, Nevem Square, South Kensington; to whom I
simultaneously wrote a private and confidential note, instructing
him that if any young female person was to inquire particulars
of my birth, origin, &c., he was to tell the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, especially making it clear
that I was neither a tip-top Rajah, nor a Leviathan of filthy
lucre.
The rest (up to present date) is silence; but I have confident
my friend, young HOWARD, will accomplish the job, and pro-
cure me the happy release.
I am now to pass to a different subject—to wit, a visit I paid
some time since to the India Office. The why of the wherefore
was that, in conversation with the ALLBUTT-INNETTS, I had
boasted freely of the credit I was in with certain high grade
India Official nobs, who could refuse me nothing.
Which was hitherto the positive fact, .since I had never re-
quested any favour at their hands.
But Mrs. ALLBUTT-INNETT stated that she had heard that the
reception-soirees at said India Office were extremely enjoyable
and classy, and inquired whether I possessed sufficient influence
to obtain for her tickets of admission to one of these select
entertainments.
Naturally I had to reply that I could indubitably do the trick,
and would at once proceed to the India Office and interview one
of the senior clerks, who regarded me as his brother.
So, after procuring a Whitaker Almanack, and hunting up the
name of one of the most senior, I cabbed to Whitehall. Inside
the entrance I found an attendant sitting at a table absorbed
in reading, who rose and inquired my business, and upon my
statement that I desired to see Mr. BREAKWATER, Esq., on
urgent business, courteously directed me up a marble staircase,
at the top of which was a second attendant, also engaged in
brown study—for the attendants appear to be laudably addicted
to the cultivation of their minds.
He informed me that I should find Mr. BREAKWATER'S room
down a certain corridor, and proceeding thither, I stopped a
clerk who was hurrying along with his hands full of documents,
and represented that I had come for an immediate interview
with Mr. BREAKWATER on highly important matters.
He demanded incredulously whether Mr. BREAKWATER ex-
pected me.
This elevated my monkey, and I retorted, haughtily, that I
was the bosom friend of said Mr. В., who would be overjoyed
to receive me, and, following him into a room, I peremptorily
demanded that he should inform his master without fail that
Baboo JABBERJEE was there.
Whereupon, with the nonchalance of a Jack in an office, he
rang a bell and desired an attendant to usher me to the waiting-
room.
There, in a large gloomy apartment, surrounded by portraits
of English and Native big pots, I did sit patiently sucking the
golden nob of my umbrella for a quarter of an hour, until the
attendant returned, saying, that Mr. BREAKWATER could see me
now, and presently showed me.into the aforesaid private room,
where, behind a large table covered with wicker baskets con-
taining dockets and memoranda, et hoc genus omne, sat the very
gentleman whom I had recently taken for his own underling!
Formerly I should have proffered abject excuses, but I am
now sufficiently up in British observances to know that the only
necessary is a frank and breezy apology.
So, disguising my bashful confusion, I said, "I am awfully
sorry that I took you, my dear old chap, for a common ordinary
fellow; but remember the proverb, that 'appearances are deceit-
ful,' and do not reveal a thin skin about a rather natural
mistake."
Mr. BREAKWATER courteously entreated me not to mention
the affair, but to state my business briefly. Accordingly I
related how I was a native Bengalee student, at present moving
Heaven and Earth to pass Bar Exam, and my intimate connec-
tion with the distinguished Bayswater family of the ALLBUTT-
INNETTS, who were consumed with longing for free tickets
to an official soirée. I then described the transcendent charms
of Miss WEE-WEE, and my own ardent desire to obtain her
grateful recognition by procuring the open sesame for self and
friends. Furthermore, I pointed out that, as an official in the
India Office, he was in loco parentis to myself, and bound to
indulge all my reasonable requests, and I assured him that if
he exhibited generosity on this occasion, the entire ALLBUTT-
INNETT family, self included, would ever pray on the crooked
hinges of knees for his temporal and spiritual welfare.
He heard me benignantly, but said he regretted that it was
not in his power to oblige me.
"You are not to suppose," I said, "that I am a native TOM-
DICK or HARRT. I am a B.A. of Calcutta University, and
candidate for call to Bar. In additum, I am the literary celeb-
rity, being especially retained to jot and tittle for the periodical
of Punch."
Mr. BREAKWATER assured me earnestly that he fully appreci-
ated my many distinguished claims, but that he was under an
hopes that the manly, straightforward stratagem suggested by
impossibility of granting my petition for an invite to the annual

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE CELEBRILET AT HOME.
(A Literary Interview—Latest Style.)
IT waa with awe and reverence that your interviewer climbed
the topmost staircase of a certain house in Bayswater, and with
a shortness of breath, due not only to the length of the ascent,
but to the consciousness that in a few moments he would be
standing in the presence of perhaps the greatest genius of .the
age. Barely seven years old, Master TOMMY TITTLKBAT has already
electrified the world by his matchless lyrics, and his "Rocking-
Horse Hides" and " Dejection: a Sonnet on the absence of Jam
at Tea," are already familiar as household words.
At the top of the staircase stands a beautifully carved wicket-
gate, which serves at once to exclude the tumultuous rush of
editors who come to clamour for contributions, and also to pre-
vent Master TITTLEBAT, in an excess of poetic zeal, from attempt-
ing to slide down the banisters. At my approach, however,
the portal was flung open, and, escorted by a polite nursery-
maid, I was ushered into the sacred shrine of the Muse, the
nursery wherein the seven-year-old poet resides. A glance
round the room suffices to assure you of the artistic taste of its
occupier. On the walls hang some truly exquisite works of art,
extracted from the Christmas numbers of the illustrated papers.
Even more precious are certain other sketches scattered about
the room, for these are richly coloured by Master TITTLEBAT
himself, and reveal the fact that you are in the home of a
painter as well as of a poet.
I had barely time to glance at these, when a succession of
loud yells from an adjoining apartment told me that the poet
was close at hand, and, apparently, that he was vexed by one
of those trifling worries which a highly-strung temperament
feels so severely. From the fragments of dialogue that
reached me, he seemed to be arguing a point with some vehe-
mence. "I shan't, Eliza! .... I tell you I shan't!"
"Hush, Master TOMMY—going on like that with a gentleman to
вее you and all!"
At this moment the door was flung open, and Master TITTLI-
TIAT appeared. Disdaining the formalities of an introduction,
he began : —
summer soiree, owing to the fact that aforesaid festivity was
already the fait accompli.
"How is that P" I exclaimed. "Have I not read in the daily
press of a grand durbar to be given shortly in honour of Hon'ble
HUNO CHANO?"
"But that is at the Foreign Office," he objected; "we have
no connection with such a concern."
"The Foreign Office would be better than nullity," I said.
"I will tell you what to do. Write me a letter to show to the
head of the Foreign Office. You can state that you have known
me intimately for a long time, and that I am deserving of
patronage. Hint, for instance, that it is impolite to show
favouritism to one Oriental (such as a Chinese) rather than
another, and that you will regard any kindness done to me as
the personal favour to yourself. Pitch it strong, my reepect-
able Sir!"
He, however, protested that any recommendation from him
would be a brutum f'ulmén.
"You are too modest, honoured Sir!" I told him, seeing that
flattery was requisite; "but I am not the ignoramus of how
highly your character and virtues are esteemed, and I can
assure you that you are not so contemptible a nonentity as you
imagine. Listen to me; I am now to go to the Foreign Office,
and shall there assume the liberty of mentioning your distin-
guished name as a reference."
With benevolent blandness he accorded me full permission to
go where I liked, and say anything I chose, recommending me
warmly to depart immediately.
Seeing him so well-disposed, I ventured, on taking my leave,
to pat his shoulder in friendly facetiousness, and to say, "It is
all right, old boy. Remember, I have complete bonâ fides in
your ability to work the oracle for me successfully." Which
rendered him sotto voce with gratification.
But alack! at the Foreign Office, after stating my business
and sitting like Patience on a Monument for two immortal
hours, I was officially informed that the Principal Secretary of
State for Foreign Affairs was not in, and that all the Private
and Under Secretaries were equally invisible.
This, I must respectfully submit, is not exactly the correct
style to conduct a first-class Empire!

NOO FOR BRINOIN' YE BACK."
yet they wont let me go on the Serpentine by myself and be a
pirate! Have you," he added, brushing away a not unmanly
tear, "got such a thing as a chocolate about you?"
I regretted that I could not oblige him, and endeavoured to
turn the conversation by inquiring about his literary works.
"Oh, I've done lote of new poems—lota," he answered.
"One about a lead soldier whom I squashed; and one about a
caterpillar, only it wouldn't rhyme properly. And then there 's
one all about papa. He calls me 'a little prig,' you know, so
I 've written a sit no, a sat What 's the proper word?"
"A satire?" I suggested.
"Yes, that 's it—all about him, and it 's going to be printed
in the Twinkler. Won't he be wild, just!" And the poet
danced with the delight of anticipation.
"Any more ?" I asked.
"Well, I was just thinking one about Eliza, but it's not
done. I wish I could write it with ink, but ink does make such
messy blobs, you see. It begins like this : —
"I don't like not enough butter
Upon my bread,
I don't like having to stop playing
And go to bed;
But if you want to know
What I like least,
It 's the nurse with the fuzzy hair they call ELIZA—
I hate the beast I"
"Master TOMMY!" cried the indignant young woman, "come
away at once. You shall go to bed this instant. Using language
tike that about me to the gentleman, indeed!"
And thereupon, in spite of his well-directed kicking, she
carried off the poet by the scruff of his neck, and the interview
"I 'm a genius—the Daily Chronicle says l'm a genius—and
came to a close.

(To Foe's Poem of " The БеШ.")
H КАК the blatant scorchers' bells!—
Biking bells 1—
What a tale of torment tintinnabulant
each teilst
On the air of day and night,
How they fill us with affright!
For we never know the way the things
are coming, left or right.
How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,
All about and all around I
She who vends the "pennywinkle,"
They who "watercreases" sprinkle,
Call 'em brown—though they are yellow—
And their merits blare and bellow,
Have a less cacophonous sound.
Keeping time—erratic time
(Like to ALFRED AUSTIN'S rhyme).
How they come in phantom hosts,
Like a lot of "scorching" ghosts!
How they burst from shadowy nooks
Like to pedal-pounding spooks,
On the elderly pedestrian all alone!
And the people, ah! the people,
Who come spinning down the steep hill.
And feel glory in a broken limb or dislo-
cated bone
When belonging to a "duffer,"
Or a mere non-biking "buffer " I
Oh, those bells, how much we suffer
From their squealing
When the inconsiderate idiot devotes
himself to "wheeling."
Oh, those bells!
And the hideous yahoo yells!
Shout plux tintinnabulation which unmu-
sically swells
From the bounders who are sounders
Of the blaring bikers' bells,
Of the bells.
Oh, the discumbobulation and the mad-
dening aggravation,
And the ditherutn-engendering, scorch-
ing conflobustication
Of bike bells 111
WHAT THE WILD WAVES ARE
SAYING.
THAT the lodging-house keepers are on
the look out for the weary Londoners and
their boxes.
That the sea breezes will attract all the
world from the Metropolis to the coast.
That Britons should prefer Ramsgate,
Eastbourne, Scarborough, and the like,
to Dieppe, Dinard, and Boulogne.
That paterfamilias should remember,
when paying the bill, that a two months'
letting barely compensates for an empty
house during the remainder of the year.
That the shore is a place of recreation
for all but the bathing-machine horse.
That the circulating libraries are
stocked with superfluous copies of un-
known novels waiting to be read.
That, finally, during the excursion sea-

Thursday.—The season draws to a close. Next Tuesday, ere
these few lines which end our record shall have appeared, the
curtain will have been rung down on the Operatic Season of
1896. A good season if 'not a great one; a sad one to all who
knew and appreciated our one and only DUURIOLANUS OPERATI-
CU8. To his energy the opera for many years has owed it«
success. He gave us English, Italian, German, French Opera;
he was a cosmopolitan revivalist, and to him we owe the very
pick of European celebrities on the operatic stage. DRURIO-
LANUS has shown the way; others may follow, and successfully,
in his footsteps.
To-night, Don Giovanni, with excellent, though not an ideal,
caste. Signor ANCONA is the Don, not perhaps all our
fancy (and experience) painted: but still, just now it would
be difficult to find a better representative of the tradi-
tional "wicked nobleman." Madame ALBANI, vocally and
dramatically powerful as the unfortunate Donna Anna (whom
the Don ought never to have cast off, as did she not invent the
¡HI ni ni'^ Anna which made his table so famous?), gained a
grand encore. There were no "floral tributes" offered—at least,
"not when I saw it," as Horatio saye.
Miss (or as in the bills, " Mile."—but why " Mile.," as the young
lady is not a Frenchwoman?) MARGUERITE MACINTTRE is a
fine Elvira, physically and vocally; but she represents this
unfortunate victim of the lively Don Juan as gifted with so keen
a sense of the humorous as to prevent her from ever being really
angry with her inconstant and undevoted lover. When she
sings of her woes there is a "naughty little twinkle in her eye,"
as of one who still has pleasant memories of a happy past, and
who has not altogether renounced the idea of trying her luck
again, if only she can secure the volatile Lothario all to
herself. Far am I from saying that this conception of the
character is not the right one: I am inclined to agree with
Miss MAGGIE MACINTYRB, on the ground that, probably, she
knows best. I decidedly like her reading of this charac-
ter. She has evidently arrived at it after close study. Only,
if this be the character, MAGGIE might have thrown into it a little
more action, and have given even greater piquancy to the
humorous slyness of the quietly larky, but apparently very
proper, Donna Elvira.
T'other MARGARET (not "MARGUERITE"), namely MARGARET
lÎKiii is not Zerlina. Signor RINALDINI better than ever as
Masetto. Signor CREMONINI "quite a nice young man" as Don
Ottavio ; and ARIMONDI a most distinguished personage, whether
as the Commtndatnre alive, or as the statuesque ghost. Signor
PiNi-CoRsi, as Leporello, is "funny without being vulgar," but
his humour does not make me go beyond a "quiet chuckle."

character is not the right one: I am inclined to agree with
Miss MAGGIE MACINTYRE, on the ground that, probably, she
knows best. I decidedly like her reading of this charac-

if this be the character, MAGGIE might have thrown into it a little
more action, and have given even greater piquancy to the
humorous slyness of the quietly larky, but apparently very
proper, Donna Elvira.
T'other MARGARET (not "MARGUERITE"), namely MARGARET
REID is not Zerlina. Signor RINALDINI better than ever as
Masetto. Signor CREMONINI "quite a nice young man" as Don
Ottavio : and ARIMONDI a most distinguished personage, whether
as the Commendatore alive, or as the statuesque ghost. Signor
PiNi-CoRsi, as Leporello, is "funny without being vulgar," but
his humour does not make me go beyond a "quiet chuckle."

LAST OPERATIC NOTES.
Thursday.—The season draws to a close. Next Tuesday, ere
these few lines which end our record shall have appeared, the
curtain will have been rung down on the Operatic Season of
1896. A good season if 'not a great one; a sad one to all who
knew and appreciated our one and only DRURIOLANUS OPERATI-
cus. To his energy the opera for many years has owed it«
success. He gave us English, Italian, German, French Opera;
he was a cosmopolitan revivalist, and to him we owe the very
pick of European celebrities on the operatic stage. DRUBIO-
LANUS has shown the way; others may follow, and successfully,
in his footsteps.
To-night, Don Giovannij with excellent, though not an ideal,
caste. Signor ANCONA is the Don, not perhaps all our
fancy (and experience) painted: but still, just now it would
be difficult to find a better representative of the tradi-
tional "wicked nobleman." Madame ALBANI, vocally and
dramatically powerful as the unfortunate Donna Anna (whom
the Don ought never to have cast off, as did she not invent the
pommes Anna which made his table so famous?), gained a
grand encore. There were no "floral tributes" offered—at least,
"not when I saw it," as Horatio says.
Miss (or as in the bills, " Mile."—but why " Mile.," as the young
lady is not a Frenchwoman ?) MARGUERITE MACINTTRE is a
fine Elvira, physically and vocally; but she represents this
unfortunate victim of the lively Don Juan as gifted with so keen
a sense of the humorous as to prevent her from ever being really
angry with her inconstant and undeyoted lover. When she
sings of her woes there is a "naughty little twinkle in her eye,"
as of one who still has pleasant memories of a happy past, and
who has not altogether renounced the idea of trying her luck
again, if only she can secure the volatile Lothario all to
herself. Far am I from saying that this conception of the
character is not the right one: I am inclined to agree with
Miss MAGGIE MACINTTRE, on the ground that, probably, she
knows best. I decidedly like her reading of this charac-
ter. She has evidently arrived at it after close study. Only,
if this be the character, MAGGIE might have thrown into it a little

THERE was a time in recent history when GEOFF HORNBY was
the most important man in Europe. It was in the early days of
1878, when, in command of the British Fleet, he proceeded to the
Sea of Marmora with instructions to pass the Dardanelles whether
the Turk pleased or didn't, and steam up to Constantinople.
The East of Europe was at the time strewn thickly with gun-
powder, on which a spark alighting would, as a Member of the
House of Commons once said, have let slip the dogs of war.
Everything depended on the tact and judgment of the Admiral
in command of the British Fleet. It was a serious trial, from
which HORNBY came out triumphant. In his "Life," written
by his daughter, Mrs. FEED EOERTON, and published by BLACK-
WOOD, the stirring story is simply told. The veil is lifted from
Cabinet Councils, Ministerial vacillations, cold fits succeeding
hot, and the other way about. HORNBY was, above all things,
a man to be trusted, a sea captain of a type which, never failing
in the British Navy, will keep it invincible as in DRAKE'S time
Mrs. EOERTON makes no attempt at fine writing. The annals of
her father's work are as simple and straightforward as was the
life they record.
It occurs to me that Tim Vanished Emperor owes his existence
to The Prisoner of Zenda. The surmise may be erroneous. I
wish, however, that the idea of this romance, entitled '/'/••
Vanished Emperor, published by WARD, LOCK A Co., had oc-
curred to the author of The Prisoner of Zenda, instead of to Mr.
PERCY ANDREA, who wastes his own and his reader's time on
two-thirds of the book. Everything up to chapter twelve might
easily have been told in a single chapter, or at most, in a couple.
From the twelfth chapter up to the eighteenth and last, the
story is told with considerable dramatic power, though marred
as is the first part by tedious dialogues and apparently muddle-
headed explanations. Well stage-managed, the scene of the
Council of Royalties, the surrounding of the palace by the
revolutionary mob, and the sudden arrival of the Vanished Em-
peror, would bring down the curtain on the third act to tumultu-
ous applause. THE BARON.

ACCORDING to the Lady, to be fashionable nowadays we must

Hunter's Weekly, and indicating a combined breakfast and
lunch. At Oxford, however, two years ago, an important dis-
tinction was drawn. The combination-meal, when nearer the
usual breakfast hour, is "brunch," and, when nearer luncheon,
is "blunch." Please don't forget this.

by the way, last year, by Mr. GUY BERINGER, in the now defunct
Hunter's Weekly, and indicating a combined breakfast and
lunch. At Oxford, however, two years ago, an important dis-
tinction was drawn. The combination-meal, when nearer the
usual breakfast hour, is "brunch," and, when nearer luncheon,
is "blunch." Please don't forget this.
'Tis the voice of the Bruncher, I heard him complain,
"You have waked me too soon, I must slumber again!
When the clock says it's twelve, then perhaps I '11 revive,
Meanwhile into bed yet once more let me dive!
The last meal I had was about 3 A.M.;
l'm a writer, so please don't such habits condemn I
This cross between supper and breakfast I '11 name,
If you'll let me, a 'suckfast'—and 'brupper"s the same!
Later on, too, a similar mixture I make,
And of ' five o'clock tinner ' at seven I partake;
The term 's à propos, for the fare is tinned meat,
With tea for 'ontray ' and lump sugar for sweet.
While the small hours get larger l'm fit as a flea,
The sunrise I 'm cheerfully ready to see,
With 'blunch' for to-morrow, and no trains to catch,
I don't need to repose with unseemly despatch.
Beauty sleep is a thing that ne'er troubles my head;
When the cock has done crowing I turn into bed,
Then peacefully dream of the virtues of 'blunch,'
And, on waking, I rise and indite this to Punch!"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM тнв DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Rouse of Commons, Monday, July 20.
—The Thanes fly from Рыков ARTHUR.
He sits on the Treasury Bench with a gal-
lant smile on a worried face; they cluster
below the Gangway and say things."
Colonel SAUNDERSON strategically aggra-
vates situation by wearing an aggressive
sky-blue scarf. This sheds ghastly pallor
over face of CAUSÓN sitting near him.
Even makes WABING and SMITH-BARET
look like ghosts of their former selves.
With reckless chivalry the Colonel
stretches his warlock defiantly across his
shapely head. If anyone wants his scalp,
and can take it, don't let them say that
he placed them at a mean disadvantage
by giving them nothing to hold on by.
For years he has fought his country-
men on the Benches opposite. Now the
adversary is parted only Ъу the breadth
of the Gangway. It is his once-loved but
now lost leader PRINCE- ARTHUR against
whom the sharp point of his well-proven
blade is turned. The Colonel, like
another warrior (Major Bagstock to wit),
is tough. But as he stood up to-night.
and amid unwonted cheers from Radical
throats announced his intention to vote
against Government resolution to sus-
pend Twejve o'Clock Rule for rest of
Session, his voice faltered. An unwonted
sigh trembled in his manly bosom. It is
bad enough for CARSON, in the last Par-
liament PRINOB ARTHUR'S prize new
Member. But CARSON is a lawyer, ac-
customed to find himself in divers and
occasionally contradictory moods of honest
conviction, according to the terms of his
brief. SAUNDEBSON is a soldier, bred in
habits of discipline. For him to mutiny,


•

The Brothers HEALY make their bow after their marvellous performance in
and life-long habits,
is inexorable.
But the call of duty
"The Waring of the Green."
to go over bag and baggage to the enemy,
"I could not love thee, Prince, so much,
Loved I not Honour more."
Thus the Colonel murmurs to himself,
gazing with dimmed eyes on LUCASTA,
lounging with ill-affected ease on the
Treasury Bench. Then, like LUCASTA'S
lover, he "goes to the wars."
Business done.—Twelve o'Clock Rule
suspended for rest of Session.
Tuesday.—TIM HEALY spent thoroughly
agreeable night. Irish Land Bill in Com-
mittee. TIM, with his back to the wall,
fighting the whole lot of them, landlords,
Ministers, and Chairman of Committees.
Sometimes when things flag he leaves
protection of wall and dashes in among
them. The crowd close round him; begin
j to think you '11 never see TIM any
more; when dust flies up; fragments of
CARSON darken the sky; the Irish Attor-
ney-General's coat is split right up the
back; GERALD BALFOUB'S hair is
ruffled over his pallid face. Then TIM
steps out of the mêlée-, breathing a little
hard, but otherwise incommoded. Puts
on his glasses and looks up fresh refer-
ences from erudite authonties designed
to frustrate the landlords' knavish tricks
and make them fall.
A marvellous spectacle of indomit-
able courage, ready resource, perfect
mastery of subject. Soon after dinner
CARSON threw up sponge. No use moving
amendments, he said; clear they wouldn't
be accepted. If they were, Ministers
went back on their decision. So CARSON
apparently as tireless at two o'clock in
morning as he was fresh at four in the
afternoon.
"I never watch TIM on the warpath,"
says PRINCE ARTHUR, "without feeling
grateful for the present disposition of
things. Suppose Irish party united as
it was in PABNELL'S time, with TIM,
having rubbed off some of his angulari-
ties of temper, their leader. In such
case, even with our majority touching
three fifties, Ireland would get pretty
much what she wanted. Divide et impera.
They divide and we rule."
Business done.—Pegging away at Irish
Land Bill.
Thursday.—A better fellow than ROBERT
THRESHIE REID, commonly called BOB,
the House of Commons does not contain.
Sorry to hear of his having taken a step
that arrests, at full tide, an honourable
and prosperous career. All done in a
moment of pique, which makes it more
remarkable on part of so level-headed a
man as ex-Attorney-General. It's SARK
tells me about it. Not sure I should
believe it on any other authority. All
arises out of private Bill which BOB found
time to draft, and over whose Parlia-
mentary fortunes he watched with more
than paternal solicitude. Got it as far
as Committee Stage. Expected it to run
through unopposed in last half-hour of
Wednesday sitting. When who should turn
up and put spoke in wheel but HENRY
FOWLER! Had it been TANNER, BOB
wouldn't have minded. But a former col-
league, an esteemed friend, a man not
is a grevious wrench to inborn instincts
usually given to vagaries, it s that which
stalked forth; but TIM stayed on to end,

COVERNME.N,

Mr. Balfuur (dtegiiisffl a» Fatitaff). "Cull you that backing of your friends?"
has suddenly but irrevocably convinced
BOB REID that Parliamentary life is no
proper sphere for him.
Action with him follows promptly upon
decision. A week ago a prominent Mem-
ber of the House of Commons, a leader
at the Bar, he has now quitted the busy
scene and settled himself down in dour
but dulcet Dumfries. Has taken the
Woodbank Hydropathic Establishment,
and hopes, by civility and close attention
to business, to merit continuance of past
favours. Paragraph in all the papers
states that his first guest is the ex-Premier.
So like Lord ROSEBERY; always ready to
help a friend in practical way. BOB
is of course new to the hydropathic busi-
ness. May be expected to be a little
awkward at first with the wet pack. Can
hardly in л week have mastered all the
establishment. That will come in time.
It's a good send-off to have Lord ROBE-
BERT. Still it's an odd 7iiove, and I hope
BOB will not find cause to regret it.
Businfял done.—Irish Land Bill through
Committee.
Friday.—PRINCE ARTHUR rather in low
spirits to-night. Things still, on the whole,
not going well. Bad enough to bo de-
feated in the division lobby. But to have
DON JOSK and ST. MICHAEL dining out
and simultaneously setting about to crack
him up as heaven-born leader of House
of Commons is worse still.
"Call you that backing of your
friends?" says PRINCE ARTHUR, looking
as like Falstaff as nature will permit.
"A plague upon such backing."
One gleam of sunshine is the passing
through Committee of Irish Land Bill.
Success largely due, as TIM HEALY gra-
ciously acknowledged, to tact and unfail-
ing good temper of brother GERALD.
Reflex of this happy state of things over
Committee to-night. Irish votes through

OF US TWO 18 RIGHT?"
MEMS. FOR COWES REGATTA WEEK.
1. OBJECT to paying more than five pounds a night for a
frowsy attic with no carpet.
2. Never dispute fares with cabdrivers or boatmen. The best
plan is to offer your purse to the Jehu or waterman, and ask him
to help himself. This saves wrangling.
3. In event of calling on a friend at the B.Y.S., be sure and
speak to the signalman at the gate with your hat or cap in your
hand, and be servile in your manner, otherwise this Lord High
Functionary may order your instant execution by means of the
Commodore's pop-guns.
4. On the other hand, if you drop in at the London Yacht
Club, do not forget that the building was erected for the benefit
of the local aristocracy for fifty-one weeks in the year, and during
seven days for the convenience of honorary members.
5. If you wish to make yourself popular with the ladies, take
a wet retriever or poodle on to the Parade about б P.M.
6. Always suppose that every man you meet in a peaked cap
and blue serge owns a yacht. If you have one of your own
allude to it deprecatingly as " my little tub."
7. If fond of practical joking, suggest to any American ac-
quaintances that the gates of Osborne are always open. But
after their visit keep out of their way.
8. As the German Emperor is not coming to Cowes this year,
state openly that His Majesty is an intimate friend, and imply
that you are watching his interest«. Sternly refuse to take
any parties to inspect Meteor. State with truth that you have
no authority to do so.
9. Make a point of inquiring daily at the Poet Office if there
be any letters for you addressed to the Spoof (or whatever
name you select for your cutter, schooner, or yawl). The
postal authorities have little to do in Regatta week, and will
like visits from yourself and similar querists.
10. The same idea can be worked out at the Marine, the
Fountain, the Gloster, or any other hostelry.
11. On the day of your arrival tip all the itinerant minstrels.
Thereafter you and your neighbours will never want for music
minute by minute.
12. If a numismatist, buy a handful of the tokens in use on
the Floating Bridge and send them to the British Museum.
13. If fond of meditation or mushrooms, travel by the Isle of
Wight railways. You will have ample time to indulge in the
former, and to pick the latter.
14. On Firework Night, charter a boat, and play at being
Lord CHARLES BERESFORD at the bombardment of Alexandria.
Your experience will be quite as exciting as that of the gallant
commander of the Condor.
15. Feed yourself how you can and when you can. You will
only get a chance now and then.
16. Always remember, that to a native of the island you are
a miserable "overner" despatched from the mainland for his
sole profit. He will therefore treat you as the spider does the
fly. Why blame him? In one short week he manages to
squeeze enough sustenance to enable him to bask in the sun-
shine of Fortune for three hundred and fifty-eight days.
THE MODERN BLACK FLAG.
(Fragment from a Romance that, in »pite of recent comments, it is hoped
mil never become a reality. )
"Тик engines are disabled. Sir," said the lieutenant, saluting
his captain, "and we are within reach of the curse of the seas."
The commander uttered an exclamation of horror. He would
have given way to dismay had he not been a brave man.
"Well, Mr. MATNE BRACE, wo must trust to every stitch of
canvas and run before the wind."
"Aye, aye, Sir;" and the boatswain piped all hands to obey
the necessary orders.
Then for the space of half an hour every glaes was directed
towards the shore. Would the good ship, Court Capel, escape
the clutches of the much-dreaded craft to which the second
officer had recently referred P Would she out чл il the boat that
had been called "the curse of the seas "? During thirty minutes
nothing of moment happened, and then a small vessel put off
from the shore.
"Crowd on more sail," cried the captain, "we have a good
start and we may yet weather them."
The sailors obeyed the new direction with alacrity. The mast«
bent under the weight of the strained canvas. Never had such
an effort been made before.
"From what are we attempting to escape P " asked a passenger,
who, in the palmy days of the nautical drama, would have been
rudely called "a lubberly landsman."
"We have no time for idle conversation, Sir," replied the
master; "but as you are curious I will tell you." And then he
gave the desired information.
"But surely you are mistaken!" exclaimed the passenger.
"The men who form the crew of that boat are the pride of the
English-speaking race. They risk their lives battling with the
stormy seas. They are heroes, every one of them I"
"If you had read some recent articles carefully you would
have learned, Sir, that such a view is erroneous. Salvage is the
principal aim of the glorious crew. They may be brave, but
they are also businesslike. We must not let them board us or
their claim for compensation will be enormous."
The Court Capel sprang on like a greyhound. The ship ad-
vanced by leaps and bounds. The crew were grave and anxious.
They knew their captain was a determined man, and would rather
sink his ship than surrender.
"If worst comes to the worst," he murmured, "run the vessel
on to a sunken rock and we sink together. It will be cheaper
in the long run."
But fortunately there was no necessity for во extreme a
course. The boat became smaller and smaller, and was at length
scarcely visible.
"What was she?" asked another of the passengers. "From
what have we escaped?"
Then came the reply, uttered in a tone of satisfaction: "We
have escaped the lifeboat 1" And with this the captain closed
his glass and feared no longer.

Mr. Balfuur (ilisyuiiied an Fulttaff). "Cull you that bncking of your friends?"
has suddenly but irrevocably convinced
BOB REID that Parliamentary life is no
proper sphere for him.
Action with him follows promptly upon
decision. A week ago a prominent Mem-
ber of the House of Commons, a leader
at the Bar, he has now quitted the busy
scene and settled himself down in dour
but dulcet Dumfries. Has taken the
Woodbank Hydropathic Establishment,
and hopes, by civility and close attention
to business, to merit continuance of past
favours. Paragraph in all the papers
states that his first guest is the ex-Premier.
So like Lord ROSEBERY; always ready to
help a friend in practical way. BOB
is of course new to the hydropathic busi-
ness. May be expected to be a little
awkward at first with the wet pack. Can
hardly in a week have mastered all the
j establishment. That will come in time.
'It 's a good send-off to have Lord ROSE-
BERT. Still it 's an odd move, and I hope
BOB will not find cause to regret it.
HusinfM done.—Irish Land Bill through
Committee.
Friday.—PRINCE ARTHUR rather in low
spirits to-night. Things still, on the whole,
not going well. Bad enough to bo de-
feated in the division lobby. But to have
DON JOSE and ST. MICHAEL dining out
and simultaneously setting about to crack
him up as heaven-born leader of House
of Commons is worse still.
"Call you that backing of your
friends?" says PRINCB ARTHUR, looking
as like Fahtaff as nature will permit.
"A plague upon such backing."
One gleam of sunshine is the passing
through Committee of Irish Land Bill.
Success largely due, as TIM HBALY gra-
ciously acknowledged, to tact and unfail-
ing good temper of brother GERALD.
Reflex of this happy state of things over
Committee to-night. Irish votes through
on stroke of midnight. So all go home;
some to bed.
Business done.—Irish Estimates through

WHAT TO WEAR ON YOUR WEDDING DAY.
(By a Confirmed and Cantankerous Celibate.)
MARRIED in white.
You have hooked him all right.
Married in grey,
He will ne'er get away.
Married in black,
He will wish himself back.
Married in red.
He will wish himself dead.
Married in green,
His true colour is seen.
Married in blue,
He will look it, not you.
Married in pearl,
He the distaff will twirl.
Married in yellow,
Poor fellow! Poor fellow!
Married in brown,
Down, dpwn; derry down.
Married in pink,
To a slave he will sink.
Married in crimson,
He '11 dangle your whims on.
Married in buff,
He will soon have enough.
Married in scarlet,
Poor victimised varlet 1
Married in violet, purple, or puce,
It doesn't much matter, they all mean—

"By THE WAY, SNOOKSON—I 'VE GOT A BET WITH MY FRIKND
BROWN HERE ABOUT THAT SATIRICAL POEM OF YOURS IN THIS
WEEK'S GADFLY; I SAID I COULDN'T FOR THE LIFE OF ME SEE ANY
POINT IN IT, AND HE DECLARES THERE IS NO POINT. NOW, WHICH
OF US TWO IB RIGHT?"
MEMS. FOR COWES REGATTA WEEK.
1. OBJECT to paying more than five pounds a night for a
frowsy attic with no carpet.
2. Never dispute fares with cabdrivers or boatmen. The best
plan is to offer your purse to the Jehu or waterman, and ask him
to help himself. This saves wrangling.
3. In event of calling on a friend at the R.Y.S., be sure and
speak to the signalman at the gate with your hat or cap in your
hand, and be servile in your manner, otherwise this Lord High
Functionary may order your instant execution by means of thf
Commodore's pop-guns.
4. On the other hand, if you drop in at the London Yacht
Club, do not forget that the building was erected for the benefit
of the local aristocracy for fifty-one weeks in the year, and during
seven days for the convenience of honorary members.
5. If you wish to make yourself popular with the ladies, take
a wet retriever or poodle on to the Parade about 5 P.M.
6. Always suppose that every man you meet in a peaked cap
and blue serge owns a yacht. If you have one of your own
allude to it deprecatingly as " my little tub."
7. If fond of practical joking, suggest to any American ac-
quaintances that the gates of Osborne are always open. But
after their visit keep out of their way.
8. As the German Emperor is not coming to Cowes this year,
state openly that His Majesty is an intimate friend, and imply
that you are watching his intereste. Sternly refuse to take
any parties to inspect Meteor. State with truth that you have
no authority to do so.
9. Make a point of inquiring daily at the Post Office if there
be any letters for you addressed to the Spoof (or whatever
name you select for your cutter, schooner, or yawl). The
postal authorities have little to do in Regatta week, and will
like visits from yourself and similar querists.
10. The same idea can be worked out at the Marine, the
Fountain, the Gloster, or any other hostelry.
11. On the day of your arrival tip all the itinerant minstrels.
Thereafter you and your neighbours will never want for music
minute by minute.
12. If a numismatist, buy a handful of the tokens in use on
the Floating Bridge and send them to the British Museum.
13. If fond of meditation or mushrooms, travel by the Isle of
Wight railways. You will have ample time to indulge in the
former, and to pick the latter.
14. On Firework Night, charter a boat, and play at being
Lord CHARLES BERESFORD at the bombardment of Alexandria.
Your experience will be quite as exciting as that of the gallant
commander of the Condor.
15. Feed yourself how you can and when you can. You will
only get a chance now and then.
16. Always remember, that to a native of the island you are
a miserable "overner" despatched from the mainland for his
sole profit. He will therefore treat you as the spider does the
fly. Why blame him? In one short week he manages to
squeeze enough sustenance to enable him to bask in the sun-
shine of Fortune for three hundred and fifty-eight days.
THE MODERN BLACK FLAG.
(Fragment from a Romance that, in spite of recent comments, it ù hoped
imll never become a reality. )
"THE engines are disabled. Sir," said the lieutenant, saluting
his captain, "and we are within reach of the curse of the seas."
The commander uttered an exclamation of horror. He would
have given way to dismay had he not been a brave man.
"Well, Mr. MATNE BRACK, we must trust to every stitch of
canvas and run before the wind."
"Aye, aye, Sir ;" and the boatswain piped all hands to obey
the necessary orders.
Then for the space of half an hour every glass was directed
towards the shore. Would the good ship, Court Capel, escape
the clutches of the much-dreaded craft to which the second
officer had recently referred P Would she outsail the boat that
had been called " the curse of the seas "? During thirty minutée
nothing of moment happened, and then a small vessel put off
from the shore.
"Crowd on more sail," cried the captain, "we have a good
start and we may yet weather them."
The sailors obeyed the new direction with alacrity. The masts
bent under the weight of the strained canvas. Never had such
an effort been made before.
"From what are we attempting to escape ?" asked a passenger,
who, in the palmy days of the nautical drama, would have been
rudely called "a lubberly landsman."
"We have no time for idle conversation, 'Sir," replied the
master; "but as you are curious I will tell you." And then he
gave the desired information.
'• But surely you are mistaken!" exclaimed the passenger.
"The men who form the crew of that boat are the pride of the
English-speaking race. They risk their lives battling with the
stormy seas. They are heroes, every one of them!"
"If you had read some recent articles carefully you would
have learned, Sir, that such a view is erroneous. Salvage is the
principal aim of the glorious crew. They may be brave, but
they are also businesslike. We must not let them board us or
their claim for compensation will be enormous."
The Court Capel sprang on like a greyhound. The ship ad-
vanced by leaps and bounds. The crew were grave and anxious.
They knew their captain was a determined man, and would rather
sink his ship than surrender.
"If worst comes to the worst," he murmured, "run the vessel
on to a sunken rock and we sink together. It will be cheaper
in the long run."
But fortunately there was no necessity for so extreme a
course. The boat became smaller and smaller, and was at length
scarcely visible.
"What was she?" asked another of the passengers. "Prom
what have we escaped?"
Then came the reply, uttered in a tone of satisfaction: "We
have escaped the lifeboat!" And with this the captain closed
his glass and feared no longer.

These are the travels of Li HUNO CHANU!

That wibbledee, wobbledee, go in the

And there is the Teuton, who 's quite in

That orders for hundred-ton guns he can't
Ret,
Or pocket the profits he hoped to have
made
Out of the increase of commerce and
trade,
From the travels of Mandarin Li HUNO
CHANO.
And there are the "turtle doves," German
(Who're rather like eagles a-hungered
and I a nk i,
Who clapperclaw wildly in misty mid-air,
And neither one wholly content with hi:

Soaring above those remarkable trees
That wibbledee, &c.
And there is the junk in which Li HUN<
CHANO
Is paddling away, bidding orders go hang
Past the Bridge of War, where three con
quering Japs
Are lugging the booty — ingeniou1
chaps!—
To their Far Elastern home, with delight
immense,
Past the awfully zig-zag diplomat fence,
Under the Treaty Tree, queerest of trees
That wibbledee, Ac.
And there is the Britishers' tight littlt
isle,
Where the lion reclines, with a genial

Under the shade of the wonderful dome
Which overshadows his island home;
Quietly waiting, in his own way.

For the rest I must ask you at present to

But would merely remark that no west-

Will take in the Mandarin Li HUNO

Looking round on the garden and round

That wibbledee, wobbledee, go in the

But whose verdancy does not characterise
That wily tourist with almond eyes,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
"HOW TO CELEBRATE THE LONGEST AND MOST GLORIOUS
REIGN IN ENGLISH HISTORY."
A FEW SUGGESTIONS.
To the Editor of " Punch."
SIR,—How could we better celebrate the 23rd Sept., *96,
than by giving a national holiday, and half-a-crown apiece—the
half-crown being emblematical of loyalty to the Crown—to all
employés? Let the masters pay their workpeople all the same,
so that no man, woman, or child suffer thereby (except the said
masters, and they don't count). Nothing could be more fitting
—from our point of view. Yours obediently, AN EMPLOYE.
SIR,—On this glorious day, let all employee take a holiday—
at their own expense. Yours obediently,
EMPLOYER OF LABOUR.
,/fx H.M.'s Industrial Establishment, Princetown, Dartmoor.
SIR,—As one who has long—too long—worn Her Majesty's
uniform, I suggest that no more suitable way of celebrating this
occasion could be found than by ordering the instant release of all
gentlemen compulsorily connected with this establishment.
Excuse the crest on this letter paper. Yours obediently,
WILLIAM SIKEH.
Maiabdcland.
SIR,—Could we not commemorate this great day by establish-
ing a close time for nigger shooting P Yours, A TROOPER.
SIR,—It would be a graceful act if all keepers of licensed
houses were to open their bars, that day, to all the thirsty
subjects of the Queen gratis. I approached one publican on the
subject, but left (hurriedly, and through the bottle and jug
department door) without waiting for any definite reply on his
part. Perhaps you might meet with more success. Yours
obediently, A. BOOKER.
SIR,—I would suggest that all bookmakers should wipe off
arrears to Sept. 23rdVwhen it comes (this would include the St.
Léger), as a fitting memorial of the day. Yours obediently,
PLUNGER.
SIR,—I would like to suggest that all backers of horses should
pay up all arrears of what they owe on Sept. 23rd. This
would cause genuine rejoicing amongst a large and deserving
class of the community. Yours obediently, BOOKMAKER.
"WOULD-BE CTOLIST" suggests that half a million wheelmen
should ride abreast up the Queen's front drive at Balmoral,
ringing their bells as a token of loyalty. He would be happy to
join in such a demonstration if Her Majesty will kindly supply
him with a machine.
"A BALLOONIST" thinks that all the Board School children
throughout the country should be taught to parachute between
this and September 23rd, on which date a monster ascent of
the whole population of London might be organised.
Several young ladies, born in 1887, and saddled with the name
of JUBILEE, would like to change it for VICTORIA ALEXANDRINA,
as it is so aggravating to have one's age proclaimed to all the
world, and they are not going to stand it any longer, so there \
"SOCIALIST" would be satisfied with a free fight of twenty-
four hours' duration, in Hyde Park, between the various sec-
tions of "Comrades" and "Fellow-workers," who recently gave
expression in the Queen's Hall in similar fashion to their una-
nimity and solidarity. If any blighted brother-Anarchist likes
to come on (rest suppressed).
"PERPERVID SCOT" opines that the Queen's title should be
altered to that of Empress of Great and Little Cumbrae, and of
their adjacent dependencies, and that a sum not exceeding six-
pence be spent in apprising Her Majesty of the fact.
"TOMMY" is quite sure that three weeks' extra holidays would
be the beet means of enabling him to realise that he has got to
remember a new fact in English history, and by then the fruit
season will be over.
And Mr. PUNCH considers that everybody might learn "God
Save the Queen," the words of which not one person in ten can
repeat correctly. The rhymes of the National Anthem might
also be repaired.

DALY'S comedians, unlike the poor, are not "always with us."
Perhaps one of these days they may " come to stay." At present
their visite are flying ones. Mr. DALY'S Love on Crutches has cer-
tainly "caught on, and had it a few weeks' chance, and favour-
able weather, it might have been in for a fairly long run. It is
a pleasant adaptation from a German piece which has something
in common with The Adventures of a Love Letter, taken from
SARDOU'S Pattes de Mouche. As in so many modern German
pieces, there is an interviewing journalist. Miss ADA REHAN is
very amusing as Annis Austin; her sudden transitions from
grave to gay are most humorously natural. Miss SYBIL CARLISLE
is a most elegant and charming widow. Mr. SIDNEY HERBERT,
as her lover, seems to laugh at himself occasionally for being so
dreadfully in earnest; otherwise he is excellent. Good, too, Mr.
CHARLES RICHMAN, as the rather ill-used husband. How Mr. and
Mrs. Austin ever came together, and how they then quarrelled,
or were estranged, is not satisfactorily explained. But there it
is; and, this being the foundation of the play, you must take it
for granted, as in all problems some hypothesis must be
granted, otherwise we should never start. Mr. JAMES LEWIS
capital: his laugh is so cheery, and he enjoys it all so much.
Quaint Mrs. GILBERT, disguised as a young person, would give
more vraisemblance to sharp Mr. BITTEREDGB GRESHAM'S mis-
take (he plays this part very well) were she to wear long,

Hands tell tales as well as fortunes, and when he is meditating
whether the disguised fuir one is seventeen or fifty, the ungloved
hand which he holds and caresses ought to decide turn in a second.
The company leaves us at the end of this week; therefore, to
those remaining in town, and uncertain of what to do with their
"evenine out," I advise go and see Love on Crutches. But why
on crutches?

"HOW TO CELEBRATE THE LONGEST AND MOST GLORIOUS
REIGN IN ENGLISH HISTORY."
A FEW SUGGESTIONS.
To the Editor of " Punch."
SIR,—How could we better celebrate the 23rd Sept., '96,
than by giving a national holiday, and half-a-crown apiece—the
half-crown being emblematical of loyalty to the Crown—to all
employes? Let the masters pay their workpeople all the same,
so that no man, woman, or child suffer thereby (except the said
masters, and they don't count). Nothing could be more fitting

ing a close time for nigger shooting? Yours, A TROOPER.

subject, but left (hurriedly, and through the bottle and jug

part. Perhaps you might meet with more success. Yours

arrears to Sept. 23rdTwhen it comes (this would include the St.

SIR,—I would like te suggest that all backers of horses should

altered to that of Empress of Great and Little Cumbrae, and of
their adjacent dependencies, and that a sum not exceeding six-
pence be spent in apprising Her Majesty of the fact.

be the best means of enabling him to realise that he has got te

ATHWABT his golden Western bed
The sun has drawn his curtain red,
The breeze has gone, the day is dead,
Peace on Ike deep, darling, peace on the
deep!
Our yawl swings idly with the tide,
That plashes gently 'gainst the side,
On no "white horses" now we ride—
Sing me to sleep, darling, sing me to
sleep!
Like myriad gems the fair lights glow
On deck, around, aloft, below—
The jewelled boats glide to and fro—
A fairydom peep, love, a fairydom
peep!
Enchanted seems this lovely isle,
That hour by hour renews its while.
Day has his laughter, Night her smile—
Sing me to sleep, darling, sing me to
sleep!
Your voice with ever constant spell
In rich romantic theme can swell—
Or softer lays of love can tell
With accents that weep, love, with ac-
cents that weep!
No fickle Siren sang like you,
Your harmony is music true
That no Ulysses ever knew—
Sing me to sleep, darling, sing me to
sleep I
That simple ballad—what a balm
It brings I a holy, happy calm,
The echo of some long-lost psalm!
Soothingly sweet, love, soothingly siceet!
But listening on this waveless sea

My languor 's lost—I 'm fancy free!

"QUEEN'S DAY, 1896."
DEAR MR. PUNCH, — I have seen so
many plans promulgated for celebrating
the long reign of our gracious Sovereign
that I am quite bewildered as to whether
the Queen intends to take off the income-
tax or entertain all the world and his
wife to high tea in Hyde Park. For my
own part, I cannot but think that the
most practical form of rejoicing would be
for our beloved monarch to leave Bal-
moral and take up her residence at Ken-
sington Palace, where both she and the
Duchess of YORK were born. It is a
roomy old house, and the Round Pond is
famous for its regattas. I am sure that
my idea is as good as any published, and
quite as mixed.

ADVICE TO YOUNG CROQUET-PLAYERS.
1. Always take your own mallet to a garden party. This
will impress everyone with the idea that you are a fine player.
Or an alternative plan is to play with one provided by your host,
and then throughout the game to attribute every bad stroke
to the fact that you have not your own implement with you.
2. Use as many technical terms as you can. eking them out
with a few borrowed from golf. Thus it wiU always impress
your partner if you say that you are "stimied," especially as
she won't know what it means. But a carefully-nurtured repu-
tation may be destroyed at once if you confuse "roquet" with
'' croquet," so be very careful that you get these words right.
3. Aim for at least three minutes before striking the ball,
and appear overcome with amazement when you miss. If you
have done so many times in succession, it may be well to remark
on the unevenness of the ground. If you hit a ball by mistake
always pretend that you aimed at it.
4. It is a great point to give your partner advice in a loud
aad authoritative tone—it doesn't matter in the least whether
it is feasible or not. Something like the following, said very
quicklvj always sounds well:—"Hit one red, take two off him
and make your hoop; send two red towards me and get into
position." In a game of croquet there is always one on each
side who gives advice, and one who receives (and disregards
it). All the lookers-on naturally regard the former as the
finer player, therefore begin giving advice on your partner's
first stroke. If she happens to be a good player this may annoy
her, but that is no consequence.
5. Remember that "a mallet's length from the boundary"
varies considerably. If you play next, it means three yards, if
your opponent does so, it means three inches. So, too, with
the other "rules," which no one really knows. When in an
awkward position, the best course is to invent a new rule on
the spur of the moment, and to allege (which will be perfectly
true) that "it has just been introduced."
6. Much may be done by giving your ball a gentle kick when
the backs of the other players happen to be turned. Many an
apparently hopeless game has been saved by this method. Leave
sible right of way.

ADVICE TO YOUNG CROQUET-PLAYERS.
1. Always take your own mallet to a garden party. This
will impress everyone with the idea that you are a fine player.
Or an alternative plan is to play with one provided by your host,
and then throughout the game to attribute every bad stroke
to the fact that you have not your own implement with you.
2. Use as many technical terms as you can, eking them out
with a few borrowed from golf. Thus it will always impress
your partner if you say that you are "stimied," especially as
she won't know what it means. But a carefully-nurtured repu-
tation may be destroyed at once if you confuse "roquet" with
'' croquet," so be very careful that you get these words right.
3. Aim for at least three minutes before striking the ball,
and appear overcome with amazement when you miss. If you
have done so many times in succession, it may be well to remark
on the unevenness of the ground. If you hit a ball by mistake
always pretend that you aimed at it.
4. It is a great point to give your partner advice in a loud
and authoritative tone—it doesn't matter in the least whether
it is feasible or not. Something like the following, said very
quicklvj always sounds well:—"Hit one red, take two off him
and make your hoop; send two red towards me and get into
position." In a game of croquet there is always one on each
side who gives advice, and one who receives (and disregards
it). All the lookers-on naturally regard the former as the
finer player, therefore begin giving advice on your partner's
first stroke. If she happens to be a good player this may annoy
her, but that is no consequence.
5. Remember that "a mallet's length from the boundary"
varies considerably. If you play next, it means three yards, if
your opponent does so, it means three inches. So, too, with
the other "rules," which no one really knows. When in an
awkward position, the best course is to invent a new rule on
the spur of the moment, and to allege (which will be perfectly
true) that "it has just been introduced."
6. Much may be done by giving your ball a gentle kick when
the backs of the other players happen to be turned. Many an
apparently hopeless game has been saved by this method. Leave
sible right of way.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Common*, Monday, July 27.
—Quite pathetic to see SQUIRE OF MAL-
WOOD drawn to-night into vortex of debate
on Uganda. Not much of a maelstrom
to begin with. Government proposed to
take second reading of Bill authorising
funds for Uganda Railway. The PROPHET
OF OLD PALACE YARD (late the SAGE OF
QUEKN ANNE'S GATE), leaving for awhile
pleased contemplation of Westminster
Abbey as viewed from his newly-opened
conservatory windows, wants to Know
more about the railway and its prospects.
If GEORGE CURZON could, on his honour
ns Under-Secretary of State, say there
was any prospect of a native COOK or an
aboriginal GAZE establishing a touring
company; if, moreover, he could assure
the House there was on the part of the
middle classes in Uganda any disposition
to be personallv conducted by rail to vari-
ous watering-places on the coast, and to
places of social and historic interest in-
land, opposition might be withdrawn.
GKORGE CURZON, anxious above all
things to oblige, was not able to give
this assurance. That was bad. Worse
still was his assertion that the occupation
of Uganda was a legacy from the late
Government, and his declaration that if,
regardless of possibilities of a Uganda
COOK, wo did not build the railway, Ger-
many would. That more than the SQUIRE
could stand. Was able to bear with
equanimity the charge about responsibilty
for Uganda. There was the almanack to
show that Lord SALISBURY'S second ad-
ministration preceded in point of date
Mr. GLADSTONE'S fourth, and it was under
the friendly patronage of the MARKISS,
in face of strong protest by the then
Opposition, that the East Africa Com-
pany, moved by those purely philan-
thropic impulses avowed to-night by

"Beef"
(Mr. Fl-v-n.)
ex-Director BURDETT-COUTTB, settled in

Toby, M.P. (to our Distinguithed Tiritar from China). "Sir, as one of the Celestials, your b.tcel-
lency'e visite must be few and far between. I regret your Excellency has arrived when the Season
is over, and Parliament just finishing. Though, between ourselves, Excellency, as to the latte', you
haven't missed much, their performance having been very indifferent. Chin-chin!"
was the off-hand reference to Germany.
Took the Under-Secretary in his teeth, as
a mastiff might take a terrier, shook him
carefully, so as not to hurt him, and re-
placed him on Treasury Bench.
"Nice boy. GEORGE," he said, when the
lesson was finished. "Clever and, what
is more valuable in a Minister, painstak
ing. Knows what he's talking about, and
talks well. But a little friendly pawing
over does him good. Besides, what did
he mean by saddling us with Uganda?"
Business done. Quite a heap. Looks
like getting away on 15th after all.
Tuesday.—Mr. MICHAEL JOSEPH FLA-
VIN'S maiden speech not a success exactly
upon lines anticipated in domestic circle.
Nevertheless it proved most delightful
thing enjoyed this Session by Dored
House. Report Stage Irish Land Bill
under discussion. One amendment talked
about for full two hours. Dinner time
coming on. Debate apparently played
out. Hungry Members getting ready to
rush through division lobbies, became con-
scious of tall figure upstanding below
trowser pocket, leaving on view abundant
display of Sunday shirt-cuff; in other
hand sheaf of notes promising speech of
hour's duration.
A moment's pained pause; then Mr.
FLAVIN'S equanimity startled by outburst
of angry roar for division. When it sub-
sided, a voice shod in fine rich brogue
heard to say, "Well, I'm not goin' to
keep you more than ten minutes."
Ten minutes! Proposal enough to take
away remaining breath. Ordinary Mem-
ber confronted by similar circumstances
says he won't take more than a minute.
At most two. MICHAEL JOSEPH, critically
eyeing bulk of notes, thinks he may get
through in ten. This charmed House.
When roar of laughter subsided, MICHAEL
commenced. His leading idea was to
show that prices of agricultural products
are lower than they were sixteen years
ago. To that end had spent days and
nights sprawling over market tables. Hia
notes crowded with parallel columns of
figures. House cheered enthusiastically
when he showed how barley was so much
Uganda. What the SQUIRE could not stand
in 1880 and so much less in 1896.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED гном THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Common», Monday, July 27.
—Quite pathetic to see SQUIRE OP MAL-
WOOD drawn to-night into vortex of debate
on Uganda. Not much of a maelstrom
to begin with. Government proposed to
take second reading of Bill authorising
funds for Uganda Railway. The PROPHET
OP OLD PALACE YARD (late the SAGE pp
QUEEN ANNE'S GATE), leaving for awhile
pleased contemplation of Westminster
Abbey as viewed from his newly-opened
conservatory windows, wants to Know
more about the railway and ite prospects.
If GEORGE CURZON could, on his honour
ns Under-Secretary of State, say there
was any prospect of a native COOK or an
aboriginal GAZE establishing a touring
company; if, moreover, he could assure
the House there was on the part of the
middle classes in Uganda any disposition
to be personally conducted by rail to vari-
ous watering-places on the coast, and to
places of social and historic interest in-
land, opposition might be withdrawn.
GEORGE CURZON, anxious above all
things to oblige, was not able to give
this assurance. That was bad. Worse
still was his assertion that the occupation
of Uganda was a legacy from the late
Government, and his declaration that if,
regardless of possibilities of a Uganda
COOK, we did not build the railway. Ger-
many would. That more than the SQUIRE
could stand. Was able to bear with
equanimity the charge about responsibilty
for Uganda. There wns the almanack to
show that Lord SALISBURY'S second ad-
ministration preceded in point of date
Mr. GLADSTONE'S fourth, and it was under
the friendly patronage of the MARKISS,
in face of strong protest by the then
Opposition, that the East Africa Com-
pany, moved by those purely philan-
thropic impulses avowed to-night by

"Beef"
(Mr. Fl-v-n.)
ex-Director BÜRDETT-COUTTB, settled in

lency's visite must be few and far between. I regret your Excellency has arrived when the Season

Parliament just finishing. Though, between ourselves, Excellency, as to
xl much, their performance having been very indifferent. Chin-chin!"
was the off-hand reference to Germany.
Took the Under-Secretary in his teeth, as
a mastiff might take a terrier, shook him
carefully, so as not to hurt him, and re-
placed him on Treasury Bench.
"Nice boy, GEORGE," he said, when the
lesson was finished. "Clever and, what
is more valuable in a Minister, painetak
ing. Knows what he's talking about, and
talks well. But a little friendly pawing
over does him good. Besides, what did
he mean by saddling us with Uganda?"
Business done. Quite a heap. Looks
like getting away on 15th after all.
Tuesday.—Mr. MICHAEL JOSEPH FLA-
VIN'S mniden speech not a success exactly
upon lines anticipated in domestic circle.
Nevertheless it proved most delightful
thing enjoyed this Session by bored
House. Report Stage Irish Land Bill
under discussion. One amendment talked
about for full two hours. Dinner time
coming on. Debate apparently played
out. Hungry Members getting ready to
rush through diviiiion lobbies, became con-
scious of tall figure upstanding below
trowser pocket, leaving on view abundant
display of Sunday shirt-cuff; in other
hand 'sheaf of notes promising speech of
hour's duration.
A moment's pained pause; then Mr.
FLAVIN'S equanimity startled by outburst
of angry roar for division. WTien it sub-
sided, a voice shod in fine rich brogue
heard to say, "Well, I 'm not goin' to
keep you more than ten minutes."
Ten minutes! Proposal enough to take
away remaining breath. Ordinary Mem-
ber confronted by similar circumstances
says he won't take more than a minute.
At most two. MICHAEL JOSEPH, critically
eyeing bulk of notes, thinks he may get
through in ten. This charmed House.
When roar of laughter subsided, MICHAEL
commenced. His leading idea was to
show that prices of agricultural products
are lower than they were sixteen years
ago. To that end had spent days and
nights sprawling over market tables. His
notée crowded with parallel columns of
figures. House cheered enthusiastically
when he showed how barley was so much

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
The Member for North Kerry blushed
with conscious pride. House of Com-
mons, after all, a, body of fair men. His
labour had not been in vain.
"Now oats," he said.
Tremendous cheering. Flurried by this
generous applause. MICHAEL J. got his
oats a little mixed. Process of re-assort-
ment not assisted by shouts of laughter
from Members opposite.
"Beef," Mr. FLAVIN roared, as if that
were the next course, and there would be
a cut all round if Members would only
have patience.
At this stage SPEAKER interposed;
pointed out that method of inquiry pur-
sued by MICHAEL was a little minute foi
the stage of the Bill now reached. That
was awkward. M. J., ignorant of Parlia-
mentary prejudices, had filled his note.'
with market prices. If they were ta-
booed, there was nothing left for him.
Looked at his notes with rueful face, at
sight of which House went off into an-
other fit of laughter that threatened to
create vacancies in boroughs and counties
represented by gentlemen of apoplectic
habit.
"Very well, Mr. SPEAKER," said M
JOSEPH, with voice choked by emotion;
"I will give only a few more particulars
There 's butter. Now, butter is an indi-
rect product of the land. What was its
price sixteen years ago?"
"Agreed! agreed!" shouted Members.
Far above the tumult Mr. FLAVIN'S voice,
its mellifluous tones suggestive of a moutl
filled with melted butter, pealed fortl
prices per pound in 1880 as compared
with these overstocked days. Merrj
uproar so great it was difficult to follow
line of argument. MICHAEL getting a
little angry. Next thing heard as he
waved his notes defiantly in face of Colo-
nel SAUNDBRSON was the battle-cry "Egg.«
fippence a dozen."
"Will anyone contradict me?" he
shouted.
Certainly not. On the contrary, cry
of "Agreed! agreed!" hurst forth fron-
all sides. That was worse than anything
There would be some comfort in contra-
diction. If they insisted upon agreejnp
with him, what was the use of settinp
forth these carefully collated, and, as fni
as the landlords of Ireland are concerned
damnatory figures? Still there they were,
and Mr. FLAVIN'S affection for them, hi-
earnest anxiety that the beneficent ef-
fects of their companionship should Ы
shared by the House, was pathetic.
"I am not giving these figures to sat-
isfy my own curiosity," was one of th<
few complete sentences heard amid the
storm of laughter.
Mr. FLAVIN growing really angry.
Had only just commenced his notes.
From time to time he turned them over,
evidr-ntly with desire to meet incompre-
hensible but unmistakable disinclination
of House to have matter enlarged upon.
But could not find in his heart to omit
a line.
"There are pigs," he shouted, with
sweep of arm indicating the full range of
crowded benches opposite.
The gesture was accidental, certainly
was not meant to be indicative. But
these were last words of FLAVIN. The
House roared for what seemed five min-
utes, at the end of which time the
SPEAKER moving ominously in his chair,
MICHAEL JOSEPH abruptly sat down.
Business done.—Another all-night sit-
Thursday. — DON JOSE'S statement to-
night on moving appointment of Select
Committee to inquire into Transvaal
TW<1 an object-lesson for Members and

(Mr. М-с-1-se.)
Ministers. A ticklish question; situation
bristling with difficulties; a string oí
amendments pendant from motion.
Every prospect of prolonged debate ap-
propriating sitting allotted to batch ol
useful Bills. DON JOSE the centre of
attention in crowded House. All the
world listening at the doors. Supreme
opportunity for oratorical display.
Some people, who shall be nameless,
would have risen to height of occasion;
delivered oration an hour long, perhaps
two. Within space of ten minutes DON
JOSE had finished his task. Not a word
too much. Not a sentence incomplete.
Disarmed Opposition before opportunity
was presented to draw the sword. Po-
lemical debate, the worst possible thin?
in delicate circumstances of the case
avoided. Nearly the whole sitting saved
for practical work; above all, initial stage
of delicate inquiry started free from blast
of party conflict.
Business done.—Transvaal Committee
ordered. Several Bills advanced.
Friday.—" And they say this Govern-
ment has no sense of humour I"
Of course, no one had said anything of
the kind. But that 's SARK'S conversa-
tional manner. Remark arose in con-
nection with announcement that Select
Committee on Distress from Want of
Employment, under Chairmanship of
T. W. RUSSELL, has agreed upon its
report.
Anything more poignant than T. W.'s
Distress from Want of Employment
throughout the debate on the Insh Land
Bill 1 have never seen," SARK says. "Not
convenient from Government point of
view for T. W. to take part in debate on
subject he knows more intimately than
most men in House. So they make him
Chairman of this Committee."
All very well to poke fun at T. W.;
misingly honest, it would be a better world
to live in. He 's not a landlord, nor even
cousin to a peer. No slight thing for
him to sacrifice Ministerial position to
which he fought his way by sheer capacity.
Yet he was prepared to do that rather
than stultify himself. Of course, he
hasn't got all he wanted in manipulation
of Irish Land Bill. But who has? As
JOHN MORT.ET omitted to say in first edi-
tion of his well-known work, "Compro-
mise underlies every move in the game of
politics."
Business done.—Lords read Irish Land
Bill a second time.
COMMON OR GARDEN RHYMES.
THE CANTERBURY BELT»
THE poets have flowers enough to sing,
Yet ever the same old chorus swell;
Why is it they never the changes ring
On the sweet and delicate Canterbury
Bell?
Fair Kent with its wealth of blossom and
fruit,
"The Garden of England" men name
right well.
But the pride of Kent beyond all dispute
Is the Kentish flower, the Canterbury
Bell.
Just one short week in the long, long
year—
For so brief a season it casts its spell—

A QUESTION OF ETIQUETTE.
DEAR MR. PUNCH, — Knowing you to
be a past master in the art of courtesy,
I venture to submit the following hard
case to your judgment. The other morn-
ing, being a none too experienced cyclist,
I ventured into the Park on my "wheel"
at an early hour, thinking to have a little
practice unobserved. Judge of my horror
when, as I was wobbling along, I was
suddenly confronted by the Duchess of
Xminster and her daughters, all expert
riders! Her Grace and the Ladies Wise-
acre bowed to me in the most affable way,
but, afraid to leave go of the handles of
my machine, I could only NOD in return.
And I have always been renowned for the
elegance with which I remove my chap-
eau! These noble ladies have since cut
me dead. I cannot blame them, but I
venture to suggest, for your approval,
that the raising of the right elbow, such
as is practised by coachmen, gentle and
simple, should be adopted by all cyclists.
I think that I could manage the move-
ment. Yours in social despair,
AMELIUS AMBERGRIS.

THINGS ARE NOT ALWAYS WHAT THEY SEEM.
THE ABOVE IS NOT Л COWARDLY ATTACK UPON AN UNPROTECTED LADY CYCLIST, BUT MERELY ToM GIVING HIS HEART'S IDOL
HEU KIIIST LESSON.
THE WEDDING GUEST'S VADE MECUM.
Question. When you are asked to be present at a certain
church and afterwards at some address, what is your first care?
Answer. To send a suitable present for the bride's acceptance.
Q. What meaning do you attribute to the word "suitable " P
A. By suitable, I mean a fitness for display on a table, and
. subsequent description in a lady's paper.
Q. But is not your choice of a cadeau influenced by your feel-
ing of affection and esteem for the intended recipient?
A. Certainly; but as it is impossible to present anything
novel, it is wise to follow the lead of the majority to avoid
singularity.
Q. What will be the probable result of the pursuit of this
course?
A. That the bride will receive either a fifth silver card-case,
a ninth dozen of silver fish-knives, or a thirty-third carriage-
clock.
Q. What will you learn when, say, the thirty-third carriage-
clock has been received?
A. That the thirty-third carriage-clock was just what the
bride wanted.
Q. What is the characteristic of the regulation wedding
present?
A. That it is contained in a case of rather disproportionate
magnificence.
Q. Be kind enough to give an example to more fully explain
your meaning.
A. A silver serviette ring embedded in rich silk and velvet,
and protected from the dust by a box of Morocco.
Q. If you are fairly wealthy, and sufficiently intimate with
the bride's parents to make the present, what is the best kind
of gift to bestow?
A. A cheque for a substantial sum that can be expended by
the young people upon something really desirable for their r.eic
Q. Is not every wedding present more or less useful?
A. Unquestionably; but a young housekeeper may possibly
experience some difficulty in disposing satisfactorily of (say)
seventy-six pairs of silver candlesticks, and a baker's dozen of
chiming dinner-gongs.
Q. On the whole, is the custom of giving presents at weddings
commendable?
A. Yes, for whatever may be the gift, it is a token of good-
will to the newly-married couple that should bring fair fortune
to both donor and recipient.
Q. And what may be said of the man who objects to the
pleasant practise?
A. If he be wedded, that his own nuptial life must have been
a failure, and if he be a bachelor, he does not deserve to be
married.
Two Governments.
How Governments fare in our wisest of lands!
How leaders are foiled though they 're sages and braves!

The present gave promise of "ruling the waves."
But "sowing the wind" seems much more in its line.
And " reaping the whirlwind" its fate, up to now.

With an eye like to Mars and a Jovian brow,

Or, leave, like poor KBATS, a name written in water.

JOTTINGS AND TITTLINGS.
(By BABOO HURKY BUNGSHO JABBEKJEE, B.A.)
No. XX.
Mr. Jabberjee distinguishes himself in the Баг Examination, but is less
successful in other respects. Se writes another extremely ingenious
epistle, from which he anticipates the happiest results.
I AM happy to announce that I have passed the pons asinorum
of Bar Exam with facility of a camel penetrating the needle's
eye. Tant mieux! Huzza! Tol-da-rol-loll!!!
My dilatoriness in publishing this joyful intelligence is due to

"Huzza! Toi-Je-rul-lolH"
fact that I have only recently received official information of
my triumph, which my family are now engaged in celebrating
at Calcutta with peeans of transport, illuminations, fireworks, an
English brass band, and delicacies supplied (on contract system)
from Great Eastern Hotel.
And yet so great was my humility that, when I entered Lin-
coln's Inn Hall one Monday shortly before 10 A.M., and received
pens, some foolscaps, and a printed exam paper on the Law of
Real and Personal Property and Conveyancing, I was at first as
melancholy as a gib cat, and like to eat my head with despair!
So much so that I began my answers by pathetically imploring
in y indulgent father examiner to show me his bowels of compas-
sion, on ground that I was an unfortunate Bengalee chap,
afflicted by narrow circumstances and a raging tooth, and that
my entire earthly felicity depended upon my being favoured
with qualifying marks.
However, on perusal of the paper, I found that, owing to
diligent cram and native aptitude for nice sharp quillets of the
law, I could floor it upon my copiti, being at home with every
description of mortgage, and having such things as reversions
and contingent remainders at the extremities of my finger-end«.
In the afternoon I was again examined in Law and Equity,
answering nearly every question with great copiousness and
best style of composition, quoting freely from Hon'ble SNKLL and
UNDERHILL to back my opinion. Unhappily, I lost some of my
precious time because, finding that I was required by the paper
to "discuss" a certain statement, I left my seat in search of
some pundit with whom I might carry on such a logomachy.
tion in pen and ink, any more than a single hand is capable of
making a clap. Which I gave as my reason for not attempting
the impossible.
The ordeal endured for four days. In the Roman Law de-
partment, I was on the spot with Stillicidium and similar servi-
tudes, and in Criminal Law I did vastly distinguish myself by
polishing off an intricate legal problem about Misters A., B. and
('., and certain bicycles, though, as I stated in a postscriptum,
not being the practical cyclist, I could not be at all responsible
for the accuracy of my solution, and hinted that it was somewhat
infra dig. for such solemn dry-as-dusts as the Council of Legal
Education to take any notice at all of these fashionable but
flimsy mechanisms.
When called up for vivâ voce purposes, I dumb-foundered my
examiner by the readiness and volubility of my responses, to
such an extent that, after asking one question only, he intimated
his complete satisfaction, and I divined by his smiles that he
was secretly determined to work the oracle in my favour.
And so I arrived at the pretty Pass by dint of flourishing my
trumpet. But, heigho! some fly or other is the indispensable
adjunct 'of every pot of ointment, and while I was still jumping
for joy at having passed the steep barrier of such a Rubicon,
there came a letter from Miss JESSIMINA which constrained me
to cachinnate upon the wrong side of nose 1
It appeared that, pursuant of my request, she had been to call
upon Hon'ble Sir CHBTWYND. who had duly informed her that
I was not the genuine Rajah or any kind of real Prince, nor
yet a Croesus with unlimited cash.
Here, if Hon'ble CIJMMEUHUND had stopped, or represented me
as a worthless riddance of bad rubbish, all would have been well;
but most unhappily he did exceed his instructions, and added
that I was of respectable, well-to-do parentage, and very indus-
trious young chap with first-class abilities, and likely to obtain
lucrative practice at native Bar.
JESBIMJNA wrote that she hoped she was not so mercenary as
to be attracted by mere rank, and that it was enough for her
that I was in the position to maintain her as a lady, so she
would continue to hold me to my promise of marriage, and if I
still declined to perform, she would be reluctantly compelled to
place the matter in hands of lawyer.
On seeing that my second attempt to spoof was similarly the
utter failure, I became like pig in poke with perplexity, until I
was suddenly inspired by the ebullient flash of a happy idea,
and taking up my penna, inscribed the following epistle:
MAGNANIMOUS AND EVER ADORABLE JBSSIMINA!
I am immensely tickled with flattered complacency at your
indomitable desire to become the bride of such a man of straw
as this undeserving sell, and will no longer offer any factious
opposition to your wishes.
But in the intoxicating ardour of my billing and cooing I may
have omitted to mention that, when I have led you to the Hy-
meneal altar, you will not be alone in your glory. As a Koplin
Brahmin, I am, by laws of my country, entitled to about thirty
or forty spouses, though, owing to natural timidity and econo-
mical reasons, I have not hitherto availed myself of said
privilege.
However, when that I was a little tiny boy, I was compelled
by family pressure to contract matrimony with an equally juvenile
female of eight, and, though circumstances have prevented the
second ceremony being celebrated on arriving at the more
mature age of discretion, such infant marriage is notwithstanding
the binding affair.
What of it P Your overwhelming affection will render you
totally indifferent to the unpleasant side of your position as a
lateen or rival wife, though it is the antipode of the bed of roses,
especially under internecine feuds and perpetual snipsnaps with
sundry aunts and sisters-in-law of mine of rather nagging idio-
syncracies. But ignorance of language will probably blind your
sensitive ears to the sneering and ill-natured tone of their re-
marks.
I can only say that I am quite ready (if you insist upon it)
to fulfil my contract to best ability, and undertake the
heavy burden which Providence has, very injudiciously, saddled
upon my feeble back. Mr. CHUCKERBUTTY RAM, of 15, Jubilee
Terrace, Clapham, was present at my first wedding, and will
doubtless certify to same on application.
Ever yours faithfully and devotedly, H. B. J.
In writing the above, I was well aware that there is a strong
prejudice in the mind of European feminines in favour of
monogamy, and my letter (as will be seen by the intelligent
reader) was rather cleverly composed so as to shift the burden
And even now I fail to see how one individual can discuss a ques-
of breach of contract from my shoulders to hers.

So that I rubbed my hands with gleeful jubilation on receiving
her reply that she was astounded with wonderment at the sub-
limity of my cheek in supposing that she would play the subor-
dinate fiddle to any native wife, and that she had communicated
with CHUCKERBUTTY RAM, Esq., and if my statement re infant
marriage (which at present she suspected to be a mere spoof)
proved correct, she would certainly decline my insulting offer.
Now as it is the undeniable fact that I was wedded when a
mere juvenile, I shall save my brush from this near shave—pro-
vided that Mr. CHUCKBRBUTTY RAM has received my tip in time,
and does not, like Hon'ble CUMMERBUND, go beyond his in-
structions.

THE WATER-FAMINE.
(An East-End Pastoral. Some way after Wordsworth. )
THE night was falling fast, and the stars began to blink,
I heard a voice; it said, D'yer want that there to drink t"
And looking to the stand-pipe in the gutter I espied
A little ragged girl, with a Bumble at her side.
No other folks were near, the two stood there alone,
The little ragged girl was kneeling on the stone;
With one knee on the kerb did the grubby maiden kneel,
Whilst in her tiny pitcher the trickling stream did steal.
The pitcher it was small, but a precious time it took
To fill it, and the portly man his head in anger shook.
"D'yer want that there for drink, girl P" he inquired, in such
a tone
That the shock which shook the poor child's heart found echo in
my own.
Bumble's companion was a child with lank and towsled hair!
I watched them with surprise; they were a curious pair.
Now, with her half-filled pitcher the maiden turned away,
But the burly Bumble spake, and her footsteps she did stay.
Down on the child he looked; and from my shady place
I, unobserved, could see the harsh working of his face.
If Nature to her tongue plucky fluency could bring,
The uttered words, I thought, of this child might bite and sting.
"What are you up to, young 'un ?" said Bumble. "On my word,
The fuss you folks are making about water is absurd!
The cumpnys must be soft, ah, green as grass can be,
If they diminish dividends to please such folks as ye!
"What is it that you want? To wash and make you smart,
Or water your back gardings? That is a pretty start!
And as to drinking, lor 1 Is there no gin or beer?
You carn't 'ave water if ice've none. I think that's pretty
clear I
"If the sun is shining 'ot, and we ain't 'ad 'eavy rains,
And you git cholera and things along of unflushed drains,
Why 'ope for rains, or pray for 'em like parsons. Water's
dear,
And we can't let our dividends run down for you—no fear!
"Run 'ome now, young 'un. Tell yer father 'e must up and
pay
That water-rate 'e shirked when the collector called to-day.
'Ain't 'ad none for a week or more, or leastways next to none?
And mother's ill, and baby sick, and your plarnts parched by
the sun?

And if the baby ditto does, happeal to us is vain.

As homeward through that slum I went, dry, dusty, and un-
sweet,
That man's harsh words I oftentimes did to myself repeat.
"Water-iuppiy?" I muttered. "Humph I the irony is fine!

STRAY NOTES ON WOMEN.
I HAVE hitherto abstained from adding fuel to the raging fires
of the woman controversy, on which some of the most fantastic
as well as many of the dullest intellects of the century have
lately been engaged in heaping logs. The whole mad business
affecte me personally very little. Not having as yet led a soft
flatterer to an altar, I am privileged to look upon women from
a respectful distance, tempered by the necessity for a daily inter-
view with my cook, and explanations to my housemaid that I am
merely in quest of a boot, a slipper, or a bunch of keys, and that
she need not interrupt her dusting and tidying operations in
my room. My cook has several ways of looking at me. First
is her sirloin of beef look. This implies that if I don't have a big
joint hot, it is useless for me to expect anything cold for lunch
on the fojlowing day, also it hints that, after all, servante are
human beings, and want their food like the rest of us; "though
perhaps we could do with a pigeon-pie, if you VI prefer the roast
beef yourself, Sir." Next comes her mayonnaise look. This
is altogether a gayer, lighter and airier look. Wben she as-
sumes it, she has evidently made up her mind that the time has
come for making concessions, for leaving the arid regions of
beef and mutton, and visiting the pleasant valleys and shady
groves sacred to entrées. For the mayonnaise look includes also
k ronii-.sk ¡i 's, crème de volaille, savoury omelet, and various
timbales.
THIRD, and a freezing look, is the "you wasn't pleased with
r breakfast" look. There is in it a sense of injury done to
A
your breakfast" look. There is in it a sense of injury
the innocent, of righteous expostulation, only waiting for an
opportunity to assert itself, which reduces me to a pulp. It
may have happened, that arriving in the breakfast-room late, I
find a kipper, a cold kidney, and a hard-boiled egg. Now the
cold kidney I could have endured, the hard-boiled egg I could
have forgiven — but the kipper on a torrid summer's day is too
awful. The unreluctant butler hears an anathema directed
cussin' jike mad; says 'e 41 be 'anged if V's goin' to poison
'isself with any more o' that trash." In this message the cook
detects a alight upon her skill and discretion, and relations be-
tween her and her master consequently become strainid, so
that during the morning interview she adopte a negative, un-
suggesting attitude, which generally ends in hashed mutton and
rice pudding.
À MAN never realises so fully how vain and foolish he is as
when he attempts to make suggestions to his cook. With an air
of having devoted time and deep thought to the matter, he will
say, "I think I have had enough of vegetable marrow. V\ hy not
a nice dish of peas?" and the lady of the stove and apron will
reply that peas have been out for ten days or more, but
that, if you give her time, and don't mind the money, she dares
say she might manage to get you, say, a saucer full; but she
scarcely thinks it worth the trouble, especially as French beans
are very good just now. This is but a sample of the pit-falls
spread for the unhappy bachelor. As for controlling his books,
the task is hopeless. Vainly he skims the long array of items:
the only solid facte he can grasp are what Mr. Mantalini called
the dem totals, with this one subsidiary fact—that the baker's
book always sums up to a halfpenny, and, however much you
may dock this halfpenny it invariably recurs week by week, from
one end of the year to the other.
Bur what I want to know is this: do women really control
households, manage servante, restrain expenses, and pay weekly
books one whit better than men P I know there is a general
feeling of pity for bachelors who own houses—an implication of
contempt for men who are victimised, and twisted round little
fingers, and made to pay through noses, and scandalously
fleeced, while women, it is supposed, not only know by an in-
stinct the wiles of the butcher, and are able to circumvent both
him and the grocer, the fishmonger, and the baker with ease
and completeness, but can also keep their domestic establish-
ment in a state of better organisation and working order. I
have no hesitation in denouncing this as a perfectly baseless
superstition. In the first place I am convinced that the whole
business—except the checking of books—is ridiculously easy,
and in the checking of books, even a man who "failed in the
mathematical part of his little go " could give the best woman a
stone and a beating. And further, I incline to think that the
bachelor gets more willing work, and, on the whole, a more
cheerful content, out of his servante than does a wife. For it
is extraordinary how furiously and bitterly a woman resents
the mere suspicion of being put upon, even to the extent of a
farthing, by a tradesman or a servant. Indeed, she is apt to
create for herself circumstances that warrant the suspicion, and
then, with a swoop and a pounce, the whole machinery goes out

Oh, very well. Fort full of provisions,

First Voice. Will, if we can; but fact
is, the camp has had to be entrenched.
The enemy are very lively. Wait a mo-

Second Voice (after a pause). I say,
what are you doing? I have been ad-
dressing you for the last half-hour, trying
to attract your attention. Well, what
have you to say? Do look sharp. Fact
is, most of our ammunition has blown up
(through an accident), and the surgeons
say that the rinderpest has broken out in
the cattle. What are you laughing at?
Third Voice (in gruff accents). Can't
help laughing because you are telling all
this to me.
Second Voice (impatiently). But why
shouldn't I?
Third Voice. I don't know why you
shouldn't, only it seemed to me rather in-
congruous. By all means go on. You
say you have lost your ammunition and
supplies. Ha! ha! ha! Well?
Second Voice. But who are you?
Third Voice. I! Why I am the enemy!
I thought I would make you laugh!
Second Voice. You the enemy! I say,
it isn't fair!
Third Voice. Everything's fair in love
and war, and I do so enjoy a practical
joke.
Second Voice, (angrily). It's all very
well to say that, but it isn't gentlemanly.
Fortunate for you that you are fifty miles
off. or I should punch your head!
Third Voice (still laughing). You will
have an opportunity, as we are advancing
towards you. Your friends are utterlv
defeated and we are masters of the Leid.
So you had better surrender.
Serond Voice. Shan't!
Third Voice. Don't be silly! What's
the good of holding out when I tell you
that we propose to surround you. You
had much better eive in.
Srfond Voice. Shan't do anything of
the sort. But perhaps if you will allow
us to march out with the honours of war
we might see what could be done. What
do you sny to that? Why are you silent?
Wbv don't you answer?
First Voice (after a panne.—abruptly)
Here we are again! We have had no end

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Last week PRINCE ARTHUR smilingly
said he meant to carry Rating Bill. Con-
sternation in Scottish camp. Having
threatened war they must needs carry it
on. No going away for accelerated holi-
day. Must stay in town and fight Rating
Bill line by line.
Most touching case that of CAWMELL-
BANNERMAN. Due at Marienbad last
week. Friday was fixed for the great
annual festival, when burgomaster and
burghers go forth to meet the personage
who has come to be regarded as the pa-
tron saint of Marienbad. To see CAW-
MELL-BANNERMAN laurel-crowned, led in
procession on his arrival at Marienbad is
the chief event of the season. Not able
to go last week. Other Scotch Members,
with almost equally urgent engagements,
similarly entrapped. Must stay to-night

"A Nicht wi'- CnuMwell."
and grind away .-it Rating Bill. Only
man who really enjoys himself is CALD-
WELL.
Business done. — Scotch Rating Bill in
Committee.
Tuesday. — Am often asked whether,
since I was first returned to House by
the Berkshire yeomen, the place has
undergone marked change in character,
habits, and modes of thought. Some fel-
lows always talking of good old times,
decadence of manners in the House, and
the rest. All bosh. Never knew better-
mannered House than present. Indeed,
of the seven I have sat in, it is distinctly
the most decorous in behaviour, the most
obedient to touch of hand of authority.
The other day, a new Member had occa-
sion to move amendment to Bill in Com-
mittee. What do you think he did as a
preliminary? Why, he went into a bar-
ber's shop, planked down his shilling, and
had his hair curled!
Sober fact this, not one of SARK'S
yarns. I don't mention his name pour
cause. The poet (not WILLIAM ALLAN)
has somewhere remarked on pang of see-
ing a strong man in tears. Worse still to
see an hon. Member blushing through his
curls.
Take another instance that occurs to
mind. The Parliament of 1874-80, which
GRAND CRORS illumined with his presence,
flight of fancy on part of that eminent
statesman.
"I hear an hon. Member smile," said
GRAND CROSS, looking severely round
House when somebody sniggered at a
pompous platitude.
Good, I admit. Stood unrivalled up to
present day. Now comes LOUGH, and
equals it, if he does not excel it. House
in Committee on Home Office vote.
LOUGH wants to abolish privilege system
for cabs at railway stations.
"I claim the late Home Secretary as a
convert to my views," says he. "The right
hon. gentleman shakes his head. I am
sorry to hear it."
Business done. — More of the Scotch
Rating Bill in Committee. "What a
time we are having, to be sure!" says
CALDWEI.L, mopping CAUSTON'S forehead
under momentary impression that that
massive structure was his own.
Thursday. — Sorry to hear of coldness
having sprung up between one of best
fellows in House and circle of old family
friends. M.P. looking in one evening
on way home from dinner taken in
neighbourhood, found eldest daughter
of house in drawing-room in company
with eligible young man. M.P. is the
shyest, most retiring person in world.
Always ready to think himself de trop.
Probably not the slightest ground for sus-
picion in present case. All the same,
M.P. fidgeted about; said he had en-
gagement at his club; getting late; must
go-
AH right up to now. But it happened
that in his bachelor London establish-
ment, M.P. has formed economical habit
of turning off electric light on leaving
a room, even for a moment. His mind
still at unrest about his supposed intru-
sion, he was passing out by doorway
when his eye unhappily fell on electric-
light button set in wall by door. In-
stinctively his hand went forth; he gave
the thing a turn, and placidly pursued
his way downstairs. It was only when he
reached the hall, and heard a shriek of
laughter from upstairs that he realised
whnt he had done.
"The worst of it is," he says, in an-
miished tone, confiding his trouble to the
Member for Sark, "they insist that I was
nlaying a practical joke, a thing I never
did in my life. Would least of all do in
such circumstances. Never go near the
house any more; breaks up friendship of
long standing."
Biisinfss dont. — Lords make a begin-
ning with Irish Land Bill in Committee.
A few Irish Members watch debate from
aallf-rv over Bar. Amongst them the
mellifluous MURNAOHAN. More than ever
a pity no opening for interchange of plat-
form between two Houses. Might have
far-reaching; effect on Bill if Mr. M. were
permitted to stand at Bar of Lords, and,
addressing LORD CHANOELLOR, repeat his
famous warning to Irish Secretary.
Brother GERALD on Report staee of

teen vears to ten.

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
STRAY NOTES ON WOMEN.
WE appear to have decided last week that as regards the pay-
ment of domestic bills, the ordering of servants, and, generally,
the management of a household, women were, taken at their
very highest point, merely equal, and not superior to men.
But the highest point is naturally an exception, and I am bound,
therefore, in fairness to my own sex, to assume for it a general
superiority over women in these respect«. It seems a dreadful
thing to go about shattering idols in this way, but if you set
out on an investigation with the single desire of stating the
truth, and if you happen to find an ancient, highly respected
idol blocking your way, there is no course open to you except
to shatter it. Lie low in the dust, therefore, oh woman-
housekeeper idol, shattered beyond recall into a thousand frag-
ments, not to be replaced upon your pedestal even by much
labour on the part of your blind sectaries and worshippers.
And, since the case is likely to be argued, let me adduce, as a
piece justificative, the following little household dialogue: —
SCENE—-a Morning-room. CHARACTERS—Anybody's Wife, Any-
body's Wife's Cook. As the curtain rises, Anybody's Wife
it discovered alone with the books.
Anybody's Wife (soliloquises). Oh dear, oh dear, I wonder if
I shall ever get theee sums right. Let me see, "August 1st,
loin of lamb." Now did we have loin of lamb on August 1st?
I 'm almost sure it was fillet of beef. No, that was on the
2nd or the 3rd. I should have said it was July 30th, but I
remember we were out to lunch and dinner then. Well, never
mind. Eight and six are fourteen, and two are sixteen, and nine
are twenty—twenty—twenty-four, of course, and five are thirty-
one. I_wish it was thirty-six, because that 's three shillings, and
much simpler. Thirty-one is—oh, bother thirty-one—it's two
shillings and—twenty-four from thirty-one leaves nine. That 's
ninepence. Why, the silly man has put down fourpence. Well,
if he will cheat himself I can't help him. (Enter Anybody's
Wife's Cook, corner of apron tucked up. General air of slow
sievñng.) Good morning, HERDSMAN. These books seem very
high this week.
Anybody's Wife's Cook. Indeed, mum. All I can say is, I do
my beet to keep 'em down; but there 's a lot of us to feed, and
the boy is a very free eater, a reg'Iar gorger, I call 'im. 'E bust
two of his buttons orf of his jacket agin yesterday, after dinner.
So I says to 'im, "GEORGE," I says, "you are not doin' fair by
your Christian 'ome. I like to see a young boy enjoyin' 'is
food," I says, "but you are outragis; there 's no two words
about it, you are outragis." 'E seemed moved, but I know
'o '11 be at it again, to-day.
A. W. But all these groceries, now. The tea and sugar come
to a very heavy sum, and the cream
A. W. C. Ah, I thought you'd remark on the cream, mum.
That's Master ARTHUR and Miss ALICE. They will 'ave their
cream, and if I don't give it 'em they come canoodlin' about the
kitchen till I 'm wild, and then I 'ave to give it to 'em. But,
lor, it 's a pleasure to see them blessed dears lappin' it up so
sweetly. I 'aven't the 'eart to say no to 'em, bless their pretty
faces, but I says to 'em, "Master ARTHUR," I says, "and Miss
ALICE give over now, do; your Ma won't like it when she comes
to know "; but them two only laughed and went on lappin'.
A. W. I must speak to them again. I can't have them going
on like this. But how about the tea?
A. W. C. I didn't know the tea was partikler 'eavy, mum.
But then you Ve 'ad a lot of company in the afternoons, and
that runs away with the tea.
A. W. Well, well, I suppose it's all right. What about to-
night's dinner?
A. W. C. I've put down a clear soup and fried sole
A. W. Oh, your master said he wouldn't have any more soles.
He 's tired of them.
A. W. C. Well, let's try whitings. We 'aven't give 'im
whitines for a week.
A. W. No, whitings won't do. Isn't there any other fish?
A. W. C. Of course, there 's plaice, or smelts.
A. W. (in despair). We'll have smelts—no, we can't have
smelts. It must be plaice, and he can't bear plaice. Never
mind, he 'II have to have plaice. I can't invent a new fish for
him every day.
A. W. C. (respectfully). No, mum.
A. W. (reading from Cook's slate). Cutlets, roast chicken
and tongue, cabinet pudding. Yes, that'll do, cook, thank you.
But we really must try to get the books down.
A. W. C. Yes, mum. There was another thing I wanted to
tell you, mum. Master ARTHUR'S dog came rampagin' into the
kitchen, yesterday, and broke two of the best dishes of that set
you bought last month. [Seen« doses in gloom and lamentation.
LAPSUS CALAMI?
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—Your intelligent correspondent, who was
good enough to report, under the heading "A Modern Paris," a
painful interview which occurred between myself and Brown mini-
mus, asserts that I mentioned Diana as a likely candidate for the
Ribstone pippin. Do you imagine, Sir, that I should have been
so moonstruck as to substitute the chaste huntress for the
queen of learning—Minerva, Pallas-Athene? The next time
that the writer aforesaid lurks under my schoolroom window
let him know that a long arm is waiting for his short-hand.

loin of lamb." Now did we have loin of lamb on August 1st?
I'm almost sure it was fillet of beef. No, that was on the
2nd or the 3rd. I should have said it was July 30th. but I
remember we were out to lunch and dinner then. Well, never
mind. Eight and six are fourteen, and two are sixteen, and nine
are twenty—twenty—twenty-four, of course, and five are thirty-
one. I_wish it was thirty-six, because that 's three shillings, and
much simpler. Thirty-one is—oh, bother thirty-one—it's two
shillings and—twenty-four from thirty-one leaves nine. That 's
ninepence. Why, the silly man has put down fourpence. Well,
if he will cheat himself I can't help him. (Enter Anybody's
Wife's Cook, corner of apron tucked up. General air of slow
stemng.) Good morning, HERDSMAN. These books seem very
high this week.
Anybody's Wife's Cook. Indeed, mum. All I can say is, I do
my beet to keep 'em down; but there 's a lot of us to feed, and
the boy is a very free eater, a reg'Iar gorger, I call 'im. "E bust
two of his buttons orf of his jacket agin yesterday, after dinner.
So I says to 'im, "GEORGE," I says, "you are not doin' fair by
your Christian 'ome. I like to see a young boy enjoyin' 'is
food," I says, "but you are outragis; there's no two words
about it, you are outragis." 'E seemed moved, but I know
'e '11 be at it again, to-day.
A. W. But all these groceries, now. The tea and sugar come
to a very heavy sum, and the cream
A. W. C. Ah, I thought you'd remark on the cream, mum.
That's Master ARTHUR and Miss ALICE. They will 'ave their
cream, and if I don't give it 'em they come canoodlin' about the
kitchen till I 'm wild, and then I "ave to give it to 'em. But,
lor, it 's a pleasure to see them blessed dears lappin' it up so
sweetly. I 'aven't the 'eart to say no to 'em, bless their pretty
faces, but I says to 'em, "Master ARTHUR," I says, "and Miss
ALICE give over now, do; your Ma won't like it when she comes
to know "; but them two only laughed and went on lappin'.
A. W. I must speak to them again. I can't have them going
on like this. But how about the tea?
A. W. C. I didn't know the tea, was partikler 'eavy, mum.
But then you Ve 'ad a lot of company in the afternoons, and
that runs away with the tea.
A. W. Well, well, I suppose it's all right. What about to-
night's dinner?
A. W. C. I Ve put down a clear soup and fried sole
A. W. Oh, your master said he wouldn't have any more soles.
He's tired of them.
A. W. C. Well, let's try whitings. We 'aven't give 'im
whitings for a week.
A. W. No, whitings won't do. Isn't there any other fish?
A. W. C. Of course, there's plaice, or smelts.
A. W. (in despair). We'll have smelts—no, we can't have
smelts. It must be plaice, and he can't bear plaice. Never
mind, he '11 have to have plaice. I can't invent a new fish for
him every day.
A. W. C. (respectfully). No, mum.
A. W. (reading from Cook'к slate). Cutlets, roast chicken
and tongue, cabinet pudding. Yes, that'll do, cook, thank you.
But we really must try to get the books down.
A. W. C. Yes, mum. There was another thing I wanted to
tell you, mum. Master ARTHUR'S dog came rampagin' into the
kitchen, yesterday, and broke two of the best dishes of that set
you bought last month. [Scene doses in gloom and lamentation.
LAPSUS CALAMI?
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—Your intelligent correspondent, who was
good enough to report, under the heading "A Modern Paris," a
painful interview which occurred between myself and Brown mini-
mus, asserts that I mentioned Diana as a likely candidate for the
Ribstone pippin. Do you imagine, Sir, that I should have been
so moonstruck as to substitute the chaste huntress for the
queen of learning—Minerva, Pal las-Athene? The next time
that the writer aforesaid lurks under my schoolroom window
let him know that a long arm is waiting for his short-hand.
Your obedient servant, NICHOLAS NIBBLBCHICK, D.D.
Flankum College, August 17.
OF A FORGIVING NATURE.—ABEL, the cricketer, always uses a
cane-spliced bat.

PUNCH, OE THE LONDON CHAEIVAEI.
ABEL'S remarkable
that ball, eh, my
of its turns, of the
"THE THEEE I"S"
(Of Crickef].
A BlQ MATCH AND A BlO MORAL.
["They (the professionals) put forward their
complaint in a manner that was more than awk-
ward, and they were properly made to withdraw it
unreservedly; but it cannot be denied that there
was some foundation for their grievance. When
40,000 persons go to see a match, and pay a shilling
apiece tor so doing, it is only natural that the crack
English bowlers and bats, who were as much a part
of the attraction as the well-paid Australians,
should think they were worth something more than
the regulation ten pounds."—Times.}
Mr. Punch, Universal Umpire, loquitur:—
HANDS all round, gentlemen all,
Kings of the Bat and lords of the Ball!
Union must reign at the wicket 1
'Gainst sordidness, stinginess, temper
and strife,
Our motto must ever be "War to the
knife,"
In the honour of "Glorious Cricket."
All 's well that ends well! A bravely-
fought match,
Well ended by
catch !—
You'll stick to
BOBBY ?—
Talk on the game,
weather,
Was eager wherever men muster together,
From tavern to Parliament lobby.
Would GRACE win the toss? Would he
take "first knock"P
Would STODDART play? It was rather a
shock
When the Middlesex marvel stood out
of it!
Would run-getting RANJI a century
pile?—
.lu-Plii at Unit question indulged in a
smile.
'Twas a bowler's match, there 's no
doubt of it.
G BACK won't pile three hundred and one
on Iltis pitch;
But his twenty-four in fair promise is
rich,
And as hard as a hundred to tottle.
E'en slashing WYNTARD can't "keep 'em
alive,'F
And a first innings total of one-four-five
Doesn't send England's heart to her
throttle.
More questions now! Will the Corn-
stalks pass
England's score ? — which is not very
bumping, alas 1
Why, IREDALE and DARLING may top it!
Seventy-seven the two! Quite a nice
little lot!
But then HEARNE and PEEL seemed to
set up a "rot,"
And their captain himself cannot stop
it.
Have they "found a spot"? HEARNE
bowls GREGORY—One I
And DONNAN'S down — Ten! and PEEL
keeps up the fun—
Which unto "TROTT'S Lot" is not
funny.
One hundred and nineteen I Elate is the
mood
Of the Briton who feels "twenty-six to
the good,"
And wiir back GRACE'S men—ah, for
money!
But GRACE down for nine, and the Black

Y-1 *;
"WOULD YOU GENTLEMEN LIKE то LOOK AT THE От Сниксн?'

All out Eighty-four!!! Now our Briton
looks blue.
"The Cornstalks will collar, those
They'll just win the rubber. A pity
GEORGE LOHMANN
Should favour a split, right in face of the

A grumbler misfortune soon dashes.
But oh. that third day!!! Oh, JACK
HEARNE!! Oh, BOB PEEL I!!
Our Briton's delight finds full vent in a
squeal.
TROTT and THUMBLE are all-of-a-trem-
ble!
CLEM HILL is an aspen I They take it
like men,
But—BOB ABEL catches МсКшш.ч!—and
then
Our Briton his joy can't dissemble.
The rubber match won by a good sixty-
six!
Just when we expected the sorest of
licks!
Hooray for GRACE, PEEL, HEARNE and
Hooray for TROTT, TRUUBLE <fe Co. Ah,
hooray
For—oh, Everybody!! You know the old

And the shout of the old Surrey Babel!

Is this a game Britons wish to be fought

The thought
A cricket enthusiast vexes.
Yet who makes the game? Not the
Players alone,
Nor the Amateurs only. Together
they've grown,
MYNN and PILCH, WALKER, JUPP,

"Fair Play, Fair Pay, Friendliness!"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAEI.
JOTTINGS AND TITTLINGS.
(Bv BABOO HURRY BUNGSHO JABBEKJEE, B.A.)
No. XXI.
Mr. Jabberjee hallóos before he is quite out of the Wood.
BEING (to my best of belief) satisfactorily off with the old
love, I naturally became as playful as a kitten or gay as a grig.
For the most superficial observer, and with the half of a naked
optic, could easily discern the immeasurable superiority of Miss

"A RoyaljCommand from the Quc-en-Emprees."
WEE-WEB to JESSIMINA in all the refinements and delicacies of a
real English lady, and although, up to present date, the timidity
of girlisnness has restrained Miss ALLBUTT-INNETT from recipro-
cating my increasing spooniness, her parents and brother are of
an overwhelming cordiality, and repeatedly mention their ardent
hope that I may become their guest up in the hills some time
this autumn.
So that Hope is already recommencing to hop jauntily about
the secret chamber of my heart.
For, seeing the magnanimous contempt for the snobbishness
of chasing a tuft that actuates their bosoms, I am no longer
apprehensive that their affection for this present writer will be
at all impaired by the revelation that he is merely a member of
nature's nobility. Rather the contrary.
As Poet BURNS remarks with great truthfulness, "Rank is but
a penny stamp, and a Man is a Man and all that." Neverthe-
less, for the present, I am resolved to remain mum as a mouse.
Since I am now in their pockets for a perpetuity, I was privi-
leged on a recent evening to escort the ALLBUTT-INNETT ladies to
the Empire of India Exhibition, upon which I shall now pro-
nounce the opinion of an expert, though space forbids me to
describe its multitudinous marvels, save with the brevity of a
soul of wit.
In the Cinghalese Palace we beheld a highly pious Yogi from
Ceylon, who had trained himself to perform his devotions with
his knees with his toes inserted into his waistband. But I am
not convinced that such a style of prayer-making is at all supe-
rior in reverence to more ordinary attitudes, especially when
exhibited publicly for an honorarium.
I feel proud to narrate that, at Miss WKK-WEK'H urgent en-
treaties, I subdued my native funkiness so far as to make the
revolution of the Gigantic Wheel, in spite of grave apprehen-
sions that it would prove but a house of cards, or suddenly be-
come totally immobile—though to pass interminable hours at a
lofty attitude with such a lively companion might, on secondary
thoughts, have possessed pleasing saccharine compensations.
Nevertheless, I was relieved when we descended without having
hitched anywhere, and I did most firmly decline to fly in the
face of Providence for five shillings in the basket of a captive
balloon.
The Indian street fa constructed with cleverness, but gives a
very, very inadequate idea of the principal Calcutta thorough-
fares; moreover, to cultivated Indian intellects, the fuss made
by English ladies over native artisans and mechanics of rather
so-so abilities and appearance seems a little ludicrous I
After dining, we witnessed the Historical Spectacle of India
in the Empress Theatre, and Miss WEE-WEE made the criticism
that the fall of Somnath was accomplished with a too great
facility, since its so-called defenders did lie down with perfect
tameness and counterfeit death immediately the army of Sultan
MAHMUD galloped their horses through the gateway.
But this appeared to me rather a typical and prudent exercise
of their discretion.
It seems—though (in spite of extensive historical researches)
I was in previous ignorance of the fact—that Sultan MAHMTTD,
the Great Mogul Л к UAH, and SIVAJI the Mahratta Chief, were
each taken in tow and personally conducted by a ;trio of Divine
Guides, respectively named Love, Mercy, and Wisdom, who
came forward whenever nothing cf consequence was transpiring,
and sang with the melodiousness of Paradisiacal fowls.
As for the representation of the Hindu Paradise, I shall con-
fess to some disappointment, seeing that it was exclusively re-
served to military masculines—the more highly educated civilian
class of Baboos being left out of the cold altogether 1 Nor am I
in love with a future state in which there is so much dancing up
and down lofty flights of stairs with terpsichorean energy, and
manoeuvring in companies and circles with members of the softer
sex. As a philosophical conception of disembodied existence, it
is undeniably deficient in repose, though perhaps good enough
for ordinary fighting chaps!
I spent a rapturous and ripping evening, however, greatly
owing to the condescension of Miss WEE-WEE, who exhibited
such entertainment at my comments that I left under the con-
fident persuasion that I was infallibly to be the favoured swain.
On returning to Hereford Road, I found a last letter from
JESSIMINA, beseeching me, for the sake of "Old Langsyne," to
meet her on the following evening at Westbourne Park Station,
and mentioning that certain event« had occurred to change her
views, and she was now only desirous for an amicable arrange-
ment.
Accordingly, perceiving that I had no longer any reason to
dread such an encounter, and not wishing her to peak and pine
through my unkindness, I wrote at once accepting the rendez-
vous.
When I duly turned up, lo and behold! I found she was es-
corted, not only by her eagle-eyed mother (JESSIMINA herself
inherits, in Hamlet's immortal phraseology, "an eye like Ma's,
to threaten or command "), but also by a juvenile individual with
a black necktie and Hebrew profile, whom she formally intro-
duced to me as Mr. SOLOMONS.
Though a little hurt by this proof of the rapidity of feminine
fickleness, I began to congratulate her effusively on having ob-
tained such an excellent substitute for my worthless self, and
to wish the happy couple all earthly felicities, when she explained
that he was not a fiante, but merely a sort of friend, and Mrs.
MANKLETOW severely added that they had come to know whether
I still declined ro fulfil my legal contract.
Naturally I made the answer that I had recently offered to
fulfil same to best ability, but that, my offer having been de-
clined with contumeliousness, the affair was now on its end.
Here JBSSIMINA said that she had of course refused to marry
a man who declared that he was already the owner of a dusky
spouse, but that, on inquiries from Mr. CHUCKERBUTTY RAM,
she had made the discovery that my said infant wife had popped
off with some juvenile complaint or other three or four years
ago.
At this I was rendered completely flabaghast—for, although
one of his legs embracing his neck, or walking upon the caps of
the allegation was undeniably correct, I had confidently hoped

that my friend RAM was unaware of the fact, or would at least
have the ordinary mother-wit to refrain from blurting it out!
"Et tu, Brute!" But I must make the dismal confession that
my friends are mostly a very fat-witted sort of fellows.
Que faire?—except to explain that my melancholy bereave-
ment must have entirely slipped off my memory, and that in any
case it had no logical connection with the matter in hand.
Then Mrs. MANKLETOW inquired, would I, or would I not,
marry her illused child? and stated that all she wished for was
a plain answer.
I replied that it was a very natural and moderate desire, and
I was prepared to gratify it at once by the plain answer of—Not
on any account.
Whereupon Mr. SOLOMONS stepped forward and politely handed
me a folded paper, and, observing that he thought there was no
need to protract the interview, he lifted his hat and went off
with the ladies, leaving myself upon a bench endeavouring to
get the sense of the official document into my baffled and bewil-
dered nob.
Eventually I gathered that it was a Royal command from the
Queen-Empress, backed by the Lord High Chancellor of Great
Britain, that I was to enter my appearance in an action at the
suit of JEMIMA MANKLBTOW for a claim of damages for having
breached my promise to marry!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE PEACE CONGRESS OF THE
NEAR FUTURE.
(Prophetic Report—in advance—by Our Special
at the Seat of War.)
THE last meeting of the Friends to
Universal Fraternity has now been held,
with not altogether decisive results.
From an early hour in the morning the
Third French Section had occupied the
first floor of a house adjoining the Hall of
Congress, and were evidently on the look
out for their compatriots. At eight
o'clock the Second Section arrived in
Langham Place, and commenced a desul-
tory fire, which was speedily suppressed by
the police.
At ten the doors of the Congress Hall
were tried, but found to be locked, the
proprietor having lodged overnight a
formal objection to the employment of
artillery within the walls of the building,
which objection it had been found impos-
sible by the committee to entertain, or,
indeed, to treat with the slightest atten-
tion. Under these circumstances, the
owner had considered himself justified in
intervening on his own behalf, with the
result specified.
Prevented from taking possession of the
premises they had hitherto occupied, the
various foreign delegates sought occupa-
tion elsewhere. The Swiss, led by a
bugler, proceeded at a steady trot up
Portland Place, and arriving at Park
Crescent, deployed, and opened fire on
the Italian Section, which were said to be
in echelon in Upper Wimpole Street.
Again the police expostulated, and the
Swiss (at the double) "moved on" to the
Marylebone Road.
While this was taking place the Dutch
made a descent upon Cavendish Sauare,
with a view to looting a well-known bank.
Fortunately, the constable on duty was
able to deal with the matter satisfactorily,
and, with the assistance of a colleague,
promptly conveyed the rioters to the
nearest station-house.
The great question of " Enforced Friend-
ship" was now occupying the serious at-
tention of the German delegates and the
Second and Third Sections of the French.
The opposing forces faced one another—
the first drawn up at Oxford Circus and
the others at Langham Place. The ser-
vices of two buglers (belonging to the
Norwegian branch) having been secured,
the order to sound "the charge" was
given. Immediately the rivals fixed their
bayonets and rushed towards one another.
It wast at this moment that a constable in
plain clothe« (who happened to be passing)
showed wonderful tact and discretion.
Raising his arm, he stopped the traffic at
Mortimer Street, and for the moment the
threatened collision was averted. The
would-be rioters halted, and singing re-
spectively the "Marseillaise" and "Die
Wacht am Rhein," disappeared in oppo-
site directions.
It was now noon, and the remainder of
the delegates — Italian, Swiss, Austrian,
Russian, Polish and Danish—were busily
blazing away at one another in Regent
Street. In spite of the efforts of the by-
standers, it was impracticable to cause
them to desist. It was felt that until the
stock of ammunition was exhausted, it
would be useless to expect a cessation of
hostilities.
It is satisfactory, however, to note
that hitherto—thanks, no doubt, to the
wildness of the firing—there has been no
WANDERINGS IN THE VACATION.
The Worthy Pedagogue lakes steps to procure a
second pupil. He finds OCTAVIUS lacking in
Vfneration, and reluctant to receive informa-
tion anent the Wardendiipofthe Cinque-part».
Now that we are in the midst of the
holidays it is my desire to find a compa-
nion for the dear pupil already intrusted
to my care. I purpose to move from
place to place, giving, as I pass along,
instruction combined, with amusement.
Following the plan pursued with so much
success by my revered father in the past,
I hope to feather my own nest while fill-
ing the heads of the young with know-
ledge and pleasing fancies. This desire
is abnormally strong at the present mo-
ment, because my pupil of to-day—my
solitary charge—is a little too much for
me. He is a thoroughly good boy, but
is lacking in reverence, and it has oc-
curred to me that had he a companion
who held me in proper respect the result

would be a distinct increase in wha(
phrenologists would call his "organ of
veneration."
"My dear young friend," I said, the
other day, "now that you are at Dover,
it и oiilil be ¡is well that you should learn
the history of the Cinque-ports. You
n-ust know"
"Walk up ladies and gents and see the
live lions stuffed with straw, and you
don't pay nothing for reserved seats if
you keep your dirty boots off the cushions
of the carriages," he interposed.
"Now, really, my dear young friend,"
I remonstrated, "you seem to be straying
from the subject. According to the
newspapers — the customary source of
public information—I find that no less a
person than Lord SALISBURY has recently
accepted the Wardenship of the Cinque-
ports. This, you must know, is a posi-
tion of great dignity, dating from a time
prior to the Norman Conquest. You
must know that when EDWARD the Con-
fessor granted"
"'Oui,' said he, knowing the language,
and he gave a bit of sugar to the bird,"
once irore interrupted OCTAVIUS. "It's
no use jabbering like that, old chappie,
for all the tickets are gone and they nave
had to sell the perambulator."
"Again I must insist upon your cour-
teously give me your attention. And
here I must point out to you that as I
am your pedagogue by position, and many
years your senior, I cannot permit you to
address me as 'old chappie.
"Well, venerable cockolorum, or noble
wrong side of the water. I ain't proud-
no, not me—so take your choice, you
frivolous young whelk, and keep the pot
a-boiling to the tune of 'Judy Calla-
ghan.'"
Finding that it was impossible to carry
on the conversation further with any
sense of dignity after being addressed as
"a frivolous young whelk, I gave him
my blessing and silently withdrew.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
In Scarlet and Grey is an admirable
title for Mrs. HENNIKBB'S series of sto-
ries (JOHN LANE), since it does not appear
to have anything particular to do with the
stories themselves. Another and more
important peculiarity of the volume is
that these stories do not form a collection
of unconsidered trifles rattled off for the
magazines. Each one has a carefully-
constructed plot. Through each the cha-
racters live and move like human being«,
and throughout is a pure, strong, literary
style, a comfort in these days of slipshod
writing. My Baronite cares least of all
for what Mrs. HKNMKKU doubtless chief-
ly prizes, the story written in collabora-
tion with Mr. THOMAS HARDY. Mrs.
II KNMKKH is strong enough to walk by
herself. Her freshness, originality, and
unaffected pathos are best left to work
out their own creations. Where all
are good, it is difficult to bestow the
palm of excellence. Possibly DICKENS
would have preferred "Bad and Worth-
less," which, without approach to imita-
tion of bis style, is much in his mood.
The incident of the disgraced and dis-
missed private soldier stripping himself in
the snowstorm to shield from the blast
the waif child he had found in the drift,
is finely conceived and exquisitely told.
"At the Sign of a Startled Fawn" is an
old, old story re-dressed with the grace of
apparently artless—really artful—literary
style. Actor-managers in search of mate-
rial for a play with a strong character
part are recommended to study "A Page
from a Vicar's History." In Scarlet and
Grey is far away the best collection of
short stories recently published.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE PEACE CONGRESS OF THE
NEAR FUTURE.
(Prophetic Report—in advance—by Our Special
at the Seat of War.)
THE last meeting of the Friends to
Universal Fraternity has now been held,
with not altogether decisive results.
From яп early hour in the morning the
Third French Section had occupied the
first floor of a house adjoining the Hall of
Congress, and were evidently on the look
out for their compatriots. At eight
o'clock the Second Section arrived in
Langham Place, and commenced a desul-
tory fire, which was speedily suppressed l»y
the police.
At ten the doors of the Congress Hall
were tried, but found to be locked, the
proprietor having lodged overnight a
formal objection to the employment of
artillery within the walls of the building,
which objection it had been found impos-
sible by the committee to entertain, or,
indeed, to treat with the slightest atten-
tion. Under these circumstances, the
owner had considered himself justified in
intervening on his own behalf, with the
result specified.
Prevented from taking possession of the
premises they had hitherto occupied, the
various foreign delegates sought occupa-
tion elsewhere. The Swiss, led by a
bugler, proceeded at a steady trot up
Portland Place, and arriving at Park
Crescent, deployed, and opened fire on
the Italian Section, which were said to be
in echelon in Upper Wimpole Street.
Again the police expostulated, and the
Swiss (at the double) "moved on" to the
Marylebone Road.
While this was taking place the Dutch
made a descent upon Cavendish Square,
with a view to looting a well-known bank.
Fortunately, the constable on duty was
able to deal with the matter satisfactorily,
and, with the assistance of a colleague,
promptly conveyed the rioters to the
nearest station-house.
The great question of " Enforced Friend-
ship" was now occupying the serious at-
tention of the German delegates and the
Second and Third Sections of the French.

MR. BRIEFLESS CORRECTS A CLERICAL ERROR.
Now that the Long Vacation is at hand I have time to discuss
matters with my admirable and excellent clerk, PORTINOTON,
which are not solely connected with the affairs of my clients,
or rather the affairs of those they most efficiently represent.
"PonTiNOTON," I said, the other day, after disposing of a
month's accumulation of circulars, "I have seen it declared in
the daily journals that barristers' clerks are too zealous in
securing their masters' fees. Will you kindly give me your own
experience."
"Certainly, Sir," returned my conscientious assistant.
"Speaking for you and myself I can say that I scarcely ever
visit the solicitors to ask for money."
"I am glad to hear you say so," I replied, "because nothing
would cause me greater annoyance than to hear that you had
been too pressing on my behalf."
"Aware of that fact, Sir, I have not made up your fee book
for no end of a time. I felt that you would wish me to treat
the collection of fees with the utmost latitude."
"I am pleased," I replied, with a wave of my hand. "And
now, PORTINOTON, I have but one question to ask. You see that
it is proposed to abolish the fees of barristers' clerks. What do
you say to this?"
"It seems to me very unjust, Sir, speaking on behalf of my
colleagues."
"Yes, yes, I quite understand that. But I do not wish you
to give an opinion in general, but one in particular. Take your
own case; if the fees hypothecated to you attaching to my
briefs were abolished, would you lose much?"
"Well, Sir," returned POHTINQTON, after some hesitation and
consideration, "I really do not think I should lose anything
at all."
And after mature deliberation I am inclined to believe that
PORTINGTON'S computation is absolutely correct.

At ev"ry turn you cross my way,
You wake me at the break of day,
You haunt me in the shade of night.
In vain from you I try to fly,
In vast hotels you still are nigh;
By stretching lake, on mountain high—
Your presence fills me with affright!
I fled from Spa because of you,
At Basle once more you came in view,
At Homburg, Ems, Lausanne, Beaulieu,
And Trouville you were on my trail;
I sought a quiet Alpine nook
Far from the reach of GAZE or COOK—
They handed me the Strangers' Book,
I stared, and then again turned tail!
"Land of the midnight sun!" I cried,
"Thou '11 grant me refuge yet denied I"
And so to Norway's shores I hied,
'Mid fiords and fells to find my rest.
Scarce foot I 'd placed upon the land,
When there, with guide-book in your

SONG OF THE SCORCHER.
(After reading the Protests and Plans of the
Cyclophobists.)
I KNOW I'm я "scorcher," I know I am
torcher
To buffers and miwies who're not up
to date;
But grumpy old geesers, and wobbly old
wheezers,
Ain't coin' to wipe me and my wheel
orf the slate.
I mean to go spinning and 'owling and
grinning
At twelve mile an hour through the
thick of the throng.
And shout, without stopping, whilst,
frightened and flopping,
My elderly victims like ninepins are drop-
ping.—
!'So long!"
The elderly bobby, who 's stuffy and cobby,
Ain't got arf a chance with a scorcher
on wheels;
Old buffers may bellow, and young gals
turn yellow,
But what do I care for their grunts or
their squeals?
No, when they go squiffy I'm off in a
jiffy,
The much-abused "scorcher" is still
going strong.
And when mugs would meddle, I shout as
I pedal—
"So long I"
Wot are these fine capers perposed by the
papers?
These ints about lassos and butterfly-
nets P
To turn scorcher-catchers the old pewter-
snatchers
In 'elmets must take fewer stodges and
wets I
Wot, treat Лил like bufflers or beetles!
The seufflers
In soft, silent shoes, turn Red Injins?
You 're wrong!
It's all bosh and bubble! I'm orf—at
the double!—
"So long!"

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
STRAY NOTES ON WOMEN.
IN a careless moment, and a thoughtless mood, I seem to have
opened up a mighty subject of pressing importance to thou-
sands and thousands of my oppressed fellow-countrymen. Little
did I think, when I began these stray notes a fortnight ago,
that I was either meeting a universal want, or opening flood-
gates. Both these tasks, however, I seem to have performed.
As when a military officer, snugly ensconced in comfortable
quarters on dry land, presses a simple, unassuming knob, or
turns a little switch, and immediately, far out at sea, a vast ex-
plosion occurs, the angry waters rise in fury to an incalculable
height, a dull roar shakes the firmament, and the air grows
dark with the scattered fragments of some ancient ship duly
anchored there to test the virtues of a new explosive. So I,
as it now appears, have liberated explosive forces, and, even as
I write, woman, universal woman, is being blown into match-
sticks, never again to sail over life's ocean with her sails proudly
filling to the wind, and her company of obedient men attending
her wants. I cannot follow the metaphor further.
As I say, I did not undertake this business wittingly; but
few of us ever know how full of fate are our most trivial actions.
Letters have been pouring in upon me from the nearer parts
of Europe, all hailing me as a deliverer from a yoke. In due
succession, mails will be coming in from the united States,
from the South American Republics, from the mighty tracts of
explored Australia, from India, from Lapland, Kamtchatka,
Patagonia, Jamaica, Labuan, — wherever Punch, the great
teacher, makes his wisdom heard—and the tenor of these letters,
as I cannot doubt, will accord .with those I have already re-
ceived. These I have sorted out roughly, in my room, in a kind
of order, and here is a list of them.
ONE thousand four hundred and eighty-six are from "Un-
fortunate husbands "; two thousand seven hundred and ten
letters, and five hundred and sixty post-cards are signed, "One
who sighs for liberty." Nineteen hundred "Slaves who are
ready to strike a blow" have written imploring me to strike for
them. Three thousand bear some such signature as " Down with
Woman, the arch-enemy," while the remaining odd thousand or
ao are from "Determined bachelors," "Widowers, and thankful
for it," "Once bit, twice shy," "A Mormon of experience," "A
moment of folly," and three hundred "Women who sympath-
ise." I confess that these three hundred have moved me deeply.
To appeal merely to men on such a subject is what a writer
might naturally expect. It is a far more significant thing to
find that there are three hundred women sufficiently large-
minded and disinterested to take a just view of the position,
qualifications and characteristics of their own sex. If there is
to be open warfare between us and women, we shall evidently be
able to count upon the help of a considerable number of "friend-
lies" in any battles that we may have to fight.
I THINK it best to give a sample letter: —
"Sin," writes "A widower—and thankful for it," "I hail with
delight the appearance of your 'Stray Notes on Women.' We
have groaned too long in silence, and the consequence has been
that nobody hae cared to attend to complaints which did not
reach their ears. I have always felt that some day a defender
would arise to lead us to the attack, and to prove that women
have been masquerading in false feathers, which have really been
stripped from them long pgo, if they only knew it, but they
don't, and therefore they have gone on deceiving everybody.
They never deceived me, and I see they have not deceived you,
and I am sure there are plenty of others who have seen through
them clearly enough, but who have had to wait till someone
else shook the scales off their eyee. You have done this, and
we are all deeply grateful to you, and trust you will continue
the beneficent labours which we all hoped would have been
ended long ago. Women are quit-e useless when they are most
wanted, and nothing can make them believe that they can do
without us, though after marrying one wife I am sure I never
intend to marry a second, to say nothing of a third and a fourth
—which heaven forbid. Let me hear if I can assist you in any
way, though I am sure your task is easy enough, for if you only
attack these very formidable persons they get so surprised that
they can't resist at all, except by bursting into tears, which
doesn't count, and nobody pays the least attention to them—
at least, not in the County Louth, where I live, and I defy any-
one to point to a finer spot on the whole globe though it is in
Ireland, which, to my mind, adds to its beauties, as everyone
agrees, in spite of other people's contradictions and im-
pprtinences."
Next week I hope to continue my new crusade.
ADVICE FROM AN OLD STAGER.—The old adage, "Do not play
with edged tools," received a sad illustration in the case of poor
Mr. E. CROZIER, late of the Novelty Theatre. The coroner
hoped that in future "edged weapons would not be used in such
exciting scenes as this." To which Mr. Chief Coroner PUNCH
adds, " And never in any scenes at all, exciting or unexciting, as
n blunt property dagger blade that, on meeting with the slightest
resistance, will run back into the hilt, is sufficient for all
purposes."
DR. NANSEN'S RETURN.—A banquet to the eminent explorer
was given at Vardö, when Dr. NANSEN and his talented assist-
ants were " toasted." "Toasting " must have been just what the
brave Doctor required after his Northern visit. Of course, on
arriving in London, the at present Defeated Discoverer of the
Home of the North Pole will have no difficulty in finding The
Metro-pole, where a banquet is to be given him.

.... BY this time the sun was beginning to sink in the west,
and shone with a ruddy glow upon the vast assembly of fair
women and brave men assembled in the spacious grounds of
Did« Ib'di 11 u Castle. The appearance of the ring testified to the
severity of the day's struggles; gallant steeds, that had cara-
coled with the best at the commencement of the tournament,
now lay prone on the ground, a pitiable mass of torn tyres and
splintered spokes, while the leeches who were present to tend
the wounded riders had long since exhausted their stock of
sticking-plaster, and had now perforce to make shift with post-
age-stamp paper. All day had the lists been set, and all day had
the intrepid Sir CLAUD POICTIEBS proved himself a champion
indeed. Knight after knight had essayed to do battle with him,
only quickly to be unbicycled by his lance, and to bite the
shameful dust.
From her seat in the gallery which surrounded the arena,
the young and beauteous Lady ANGELA LOLLIPOP had sur-
veyed the chances of the battle with a more than common inte-
rest. Well did she know that, in accordance with old-estab-
lished precedent, her hand was to be bestowed upon him who
should prove the conqueror at the close of the day. Sir CLAUD
POICTIKHS she cordially detested. Where, oh where, was the
faithful ALGERNON DE BONCŒUR, who had promised to do battle
on her behalf, and for whom—especially as he was a director of
five bicycle companies—she felt the tenderest affection? Suddenly
the onlookers gave a start of excitement and surprise, as on their
ears fell the clear and resonant tones of an approaching bell!
Another moment, and there had ridden into the arena a mysteri-
ous knight, with his face closely masked. Disdaining to make
ing his lance in one hand, and applying the other with out-
stretched fingers to his nose, with a superb gesture of haughty
defiance. Lady ANGELA recognised the rider by his massive
calves, and fainted on the spot. "'Tis ALGERNON himself!"
she gasped.
The herald gave the signal. Once more resounded ALGER-
NON'S bell; once more Sir CLAUD'S squeaker blared forth
a hoarse defiance. With the speed of lightning the high-bred
bicycles whirled towards each other, with a resounding crash
they met in the midst of the ring. Sir CLAUD pursued the
tactics which had given him the victory earlier in the day, by
aiming a furious stroke at his rival's head, but ALGBRNON ducked
with consummate grace at precisely the right moment, so that
Sir CLAUD fell headlong by the violence of his own blow and lay
prone on the arena. Even as he fell, ALGERNON had drawn back
his sharp-pointed lance, and plunged it twice with all his might
into the front tyre of the other's machine. A terrific explosion
was heard, and then the tyre crumpled up, flabby and useless.
A prolonged shout of applause arose from the onlookers.
"Hold!" spluttered Sir CLAUD, his mouth full of dust, "'tis
enough—my tyre is punctured; I can fight no more."
"Then," said the other, proudly, "I claim my lawful prize—
the Lady ANGELA 1"
A gleam of malignant triumph flashed from Sir CLAUD'S eyes
as he rose with difficulty from the ground. "Nay." he said;
"not yet, young man. Know that I am a Justice of the Peace,
and hereby order thy instant arrest on the charge of furious
riding 1"
There was a moment of awful silence. And then, before the
spectators could realise what had happened, the Lady ANGELA
had vaulted lightly down into the arena, ALGERNON had raised
her in his arms and seated her on his handle-bar, he had
mounted and ridden off with his lovely prize, and knight, lady
use of his handles, he rode swiftly towards Sir CLAUD, brandish-
and bicycle had become a swiftly vanishing speck in the distance!

Society. Mr. Punch, as usual interested
and instructed by the remarks of the en-

staff, has begun by a careful study of the

In the immediate vicinity of several
shoemakers shops there are varieties of
the Arbor bootii in an excellent state.
This is not the tree which produces
sandal wood.
On the east side, not far from Pall
Mall, two fine specimens of the Arbor
Beerbohmii were in a flourishing condi-
tion until recently. They are now being
conveyed around the provinces for exhi-
bition, and later on will be taken to the
United States. It is understood that
next year these two admirable trees will
be transplanted to the west side of the
street, where it is hoped that they will
come. As Mr GLADSTONE very truly re-
marked, "the people of this country
understand the ornamental management
of trees as well as anybody."

But arrangements for the latter

There was once an ancient lady
Whom we knew as Miss О'Овлот,
Who was asked to spend the autumn

So in fear and trepidation
She sought out her destination,
And betook her to the station—
Waterloo.
She took her little ticket
And she did not fail to stick it
With half-a-dozen coppers in her glove.
Another moment found her

For she d notice-boards all round her,

So she studied every number
On those sign-posts that encumber
All the station; and she learned them
one by one;
But she found the indication
Of the platforms of the station
Not much use as information
When she 'd done.
In her shocking state of fluster
Little courage could she muster,
Yet of porters she accosted one or two;
But, too shy to claim attention,
And too full of apprehension,
She could get no one to mention
"Which for Trew."
So she trudged through every station—
"North," ff South," "Main,"—in quick
rotation,
And then she gave a trial to the

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
MR. HENRY FHOWDE has issued from the Clarendon Press, in
workmanlike style worthy of that institution's renown, Mr.
GLADSTONE'S Studies Subsidiary to the Works of Bishop Butter.
The volume is uniform with the two that preceded it, containing
the works of Bishop BUTLER, to the editing of which the veteran
statesman devoted the greater part of last year. Apart from their
intrinsic value, these three portly volumes have a rare personal

interest. In his eighty-sixth year, at the close of a life of almost
tumultuous labour, Mr. GLADSTONE bethought him that there
was something desirable to be done for the public good and
the wider fame of Bishop BUTLER. In earlier editions the
"Analogy" runs on through interminable pages without a break.
There are no indexes, few notes, and some doubt as to accuracy
of the text. To supply these needs was a task which, thoroughly
done, would seem to require youthful energy and prospect of
long life. Mr. GLADSTONE just sat down and did it. As he pro-
ceeded with his editorial work, thoughts crowded upon him
«liii-li he committed to paper. The notes grew in bulk 'till
they threatened to exceed the "Analogy" in volume. In the
end, Mr. GLADSTONE determined to make a volume of his own,
a book ablaze with the light of scholarly research. For more
than twenty years my Baronite has witnessed Mr. GLADSTONE'S
fours de force in other fields, and protests that, in all the
circumstances, production of these three volumes is the most
remarkable.
The anonymous author of Mr. Magnus (FISHER UNWIN) has
evidently been disappointed with Mr. CECIL RHODES, as other
students of phenomenal developments of nature have been dis-

THE following correspondence has overflowed from Fleet Street
into Bouverie Street : —
DEAR MB. EDITOR,—My fiancé says I 'm engaged to him, and
I say he 's engaged to me—and that 's where the trouble is. It
makes all the difference in the world, I consider. I 'm not going
to be his chattel (or is it chattle P) especially as I proposed to
him this year, as it 's leap year. So it's my show this time—I
mean my engagement, and I don't exactly see where he comes
in, except to be there, when he 's wanted. I 've always been
used to having my own way—that 's all I want, and I really do
wish he would once for all understand that I engage Aim, and
not the other way round. It would be so much simpler to start
right, and not have any words on the matter. I am always for
peace, and my nerves couldn't stand any difference of opinion.
If he only will just give way, everything will be lovely. He is
quite a boy, and doesn't know what is good for him, and is not
used to engaging anyone, not even a cook or a cabman. I am,
yours to command, MARTINETTA N. PECKER.
DEAR SIR,—I have been studying the interesting correspond-
ence, started by Mrs. ALIMONY in your columns, and should like
to put my own case before your readers. I was out the other
day with three lovely girls (not sisters), up the river I think it
was, and well—I somehow got mixed up coming home in the
twilight, and became engaged to one of them, but I can't for the
life of me remember which. It was getting dark at the time,
and I don't think I should recognise her again, and I forgot to
give her my address. I do not want to go to the wrong house,
and be interviewed by the wrong father. So what am I to do?
I am sure I care very much for the girl, if I could only identify
her properly. I don't wish to lose her, whichever it was; hut
I was always careless in these matters. Can one be sued for
absence of mind P Yours barmily, CRUMPET.
DEAR MR. EDITOR,—Sir, I am not exactly engaged, but at the
present moment am quite free to become so. I am looking for
a young lady, who must be beautiful, of good birth, domesti-
cated, smart, musical, artistic, a good dancer, horsewoman,
swimmer, skater, and tennis-player, good tempered, able to con-
verse in six languages, and having a thousand a year of her own.
Or I will commute all these qualifications for an income of
£3,750 per annum. I have a Loving Heart to give in exchange,
and the young lady may rely on my not wanting to break off
the engagement. What offers? FAIR 's FAIR.

In the immediate vicinity of several

This is not the tree which produces

On the east side, not far from Pall

Beerbohmii were in a flourishing condi-

conveyed around the provinces for exhi-
bition, and later on will be taken to the
United States. It is understood that
next year these two admirable trees will
be transplanted to the west side of the
street, where it is hoped that they will
come. As Mr GLADSTONE very truly re-
marked, "the people of this country
understand the ornamental management
of trees as well as anybody."

THE MISSING SPINSTER.
You may boast your great improvements,
Your inventions and your "movements,"
For those who stay at home, and those
who travel;
But arrangements for the latter
Are so complex, that the matter
Makes them dotty as a hatter
To unravel.
There was once an ancient lady
Whom we knew as Miss O'GRADY,
Who was asked to spend the autumn
down at Trew.
So in fear and trepidation
She sought out her destination,
And betook her to the station—
Waterloo.
She took her little ticket
And she did not fail to stick it
With half-a-dozen coppers in her glove.
Another moment found her
With a plenty to astound her—
For she d notice-boards all round her,
And above I
So she studied every number
On those sign-posts that encumber
All the station; and she learned them
one by one;
But she found the indication
Of the platforms of the station
Not much use as information
When she 'd done.
In her shocking state of fluster
Little courage could she muster,
Yet of porters she accosted one or two;
But, too shy to claim attention,
And too full of apprehension,
She could get no one to mention
"Which for Trew."
So she trudged through every station—
"North," ?South," "Main,"—in quick
rotation,
And then she gave a trial to the
"Loop":
Like some hapless new Pandora
She sat down a-gasping for a
Little hope to live on—or a

MB. HENBY FBOWDE has issued from the Clarendon Press, in
workmanlike style worthy of that institution's renown, Mr.
GLADSTONE'S Studies Subsidiary to the Works of Bishop Butter.
The volume is uniform with the two that preceded it, containing
the works of Bishop BUTLBB, to the editing of which the veteran
statesman devoted the greater part of last year. Apart from their
intrinsic value, these three portly volumes have a rare personal

interest. In his eighty-sixth year, at the close of a life of almost
tumultuous labour, Mr. GLADSTONE bethought him that there
was something desirable to be done for the public good and
the wider fame of Bishop BUTLER. In earlier editions the
"Analogy " runs on through interminable pages without a break.
There are no indexes, few notes, and some doubt as to accuracy
of the text. To supply these needs was a task which, thoroughly
done, would seem to require youthful energy and prospect of
long life. Mr. GLADSTONE just sat down and did it. As ne pro-
ceeded with his editorial work, thoughts crowded upon nim
which he committed to paper. The notes grew in bulk "till
they threatened to exceed the "Analogy" in volume. In the
end, Mr. GLADSTONE determined to make a volume of his own,
a book ablaze with the light of scholarly research. For more
than twenty years my Baronite has witnessed Mr. GLADSTONE'S
tours de force in other fields, and protest« that, in all the
circumstances, production of these three volumes is the most
remarkable.
The anonymous author of Mr. Magnus (FISHER UNWIN) has
evidently been disappointed with Mr. CECIL RHODES, as other
students of phenomenal developments of nature have been dis-
appointed with the Atlantic. He "goes for" the fallen giant,
thinly disguised under the name that gives a title to the work.
The book, though spiteful, is clever, offering a vivid and highly-
coloured description of the way they live in Johannesburg. Mr.
BABNATO is sketched with a more friendly hand than is the ex-
Cape Premier. There are other portraits, which will doubtless
be recognised by members of the Reform Committee, now at
large and with leisure to read a sprightly book. Some passages,
notably those descriptive of a visit te the mine, and the subse-
quent accident, are written with a graphic power that suggests
the author might safely trust to his literary skill to attract
readers without elaborating personal skits.
In the latest Yellow Book for this quarter the art of telling
unfinished stories in a highly-finished style is carried well nigh
to perfection by Mr. HENBY HARLAND in his "Invisible Prince;"
and to a less 'degree by MEME MURIEL DOWIE, in her "Idyll m

jects; not pleasant reading. What of the weird, unintelligible,
Blake-like illustrations by J. HERBERT McNAiR? Prize-picture-

The Britons, and I 'm one, have roved the world over,
And I should, in course, much prefer
The Pole were first reached by some brave British rover;
But tmvy 's a poor half-bred cur I
So if other crafts than true British are nearing
The Pole—why my castor I 'II fling.
Within two hundred miles the Norwegian's been steering,
So that 's why of NANSEN I sing I
Could our ships Northward Ho, wind and weather permitting,
A hundred times go and come back,
The ice-world 'a so wide, we might never be hitting
For leagues upon leagues the same tack.
The nations are numerous, various, clever,
And all to explore on the wing.
If JOHN BULL spots the Pole first I '11 pipe on for ever;
To-day 'tis of NANSEN I sing I
Who '11 wring the last secret from Ultima Thule?
But just as the prow to the helm answers duly
We 're true to the Pole, old and young;
Whoever first hits it high fame will inherit,
And fame to his country will bring.
But to pluck and success step by step allow merit,
And that 's why of NANSEN I sing 1

UP-TO-DATE INTELLIGENCE—RE BAYARD.
DEAB MR. PUNCH,—I am insatiate in my desire for the latest
news, and buy papers literally from morning till night on every
week day. On Sunday, however, my craving for knowledge has
to be satisfied with one early supply of information. Among
other journals I always take in The People, and you may imagine
that I opened my eyes when I read in its columns the following
paragraphs : —
"Four bombe were exploded under a train travelling between Navajas and
Jaquey. Four Cubans were badly injured, and several sustained slighter
injuries.
The Chevalier BAYARD, after having been mortally wounded, asked to be
taken from his horse and placed at the foot of a tree. "At least," said he,
"I may die facing the enemy."
Can it be that the knight "without fear or reproach" has re-
turned to earth, and is battling in Tobacco-land for the oppressed
islanders, or does the text refer to some descendant of his with
equally noble traits, who has died in resisting the tyrannical
might of Spain? I have vainly sought in the daily and weekly
Press for a solution of the mystery. I therefore turn to you,
Sir, as the last, but by no means least, personage capable of
relieving my anxiety. Itching for your answer, I am, your
obedient servant, CHRISTOPHER MCCENOTAPH.
P.S.—I ought, perhaps, to mention that the Spanish Ambas-
sador's footman referred me to the porter at the American

CHAPTER I.—"Nobilitatis virtiu atcmma."
IT was a stormy evening in November, 1995. The rain was
beating in stormy gusts on the old brown stone palace in
Fifth Avenue, and there was a continual drip from tue rusted
coronet over the "stoop " on to the well-worn marble steps below
the door, which showed ead need of the renovating brush of the
house-painter. Within, the aspect of the mansion was not more
cheerful. Want of comfort was evidently hand in hand with
want of money. In one of the principal sitting-rooms, remark-
able for the large collection of pictures hung on the walls, and
for sri44-.il massive silver spittoons of nineteenth century work, a
lady and gentleman were seated before a small wood fire. By the
light of the solitary electro-burner it might have been perceived
that both were of mature years, and that each possessed that
aristocratic bearing, which is the heirloom of ancient lineage.
Yet it was evident that they were not in affluent circumstances.
The divided skirt of the dame, though scrupulously neat, had
certainly seen better days, her silken hose were not innocent
of darns, and the Brussels lace of her spotless white vest had
evidently been mended more than once, while her black velvet
jacket had on it a distinct touch of old-time rust. Still her
plentiful white locks were arranged in the latest fashion, that
of the pyramid, and though the long, taper fingers with which
she rolled a cigarette were unadorned with jewelled rings,
yet they were as perfectly shaped as the toes of that legendary
Trilby, whose fame has been handed down to us from the last
century. The gentleman's suit of Tartan broadcloth was none
of the freshest either in cut or material, and the woollen scarf
girt around his neck was clearly worn for warmth rather than
effect. Nevertheless, his thick grey moustache was heavily
waxed, and his broad chest was crossed with the somewhat
raded tricolour riband of the proudest order of American Chivalry
—the Everlasting Eagle. He was smoking some very pungent
tobacco from a long clay pipe, and ever and anon he slaked his
thirst from a beaker of lager beer standing by his side. From
the working of the muscles of his rubicund face it was apparent
that he was violently moved .by his thoughts. Presently the
lady broke silence and observed, "So the Emperor will do
nothing?"
"Absolutely nothing," replied her companion, with a sigh.
"He has forgotten the days when it was a question whether an
O'FLAHERTY or a VANPEHKEN was the better fitted to grasp the
sceptre of a rising young monarchy. But what," he continued,
bitterly, "did an American ever get from an Irishman but in-
gratitude? And so I made bold to tell the Prince of TAMMANY
to-day."
"You told him so 1" cried the lady, with admiration in her
glance. "That was like a true VANPERKEN, and as became the
Duke of SARATOGA. I guess he squirmed, though."
"You are right," answered the Duke, draining his goblet.
"But no amount of princely squirming will bring dollars to our
cash-box. The pictures will have to go, so I 've telephoned
MACLAZARUS to come and take the lot this very evening. It can't
be helpdd, SUSIE," he added, tenderly, as he saw the teardrops
gusten in her eyes.
"It does seem downright cruel," murmured the Duchess,
passing the back of her hand over her vision. "It's woeful,"
she continued, "what we of the Peerage are coming to nowa-
days."
"That's so," remarked the Duke, filling his pipe. "But it
might have been reckoned on by our forefathers, who were so
crazy to have their daughters married to European titles that
they sent billions of money across the Atlantic. When the Im-
perial Monarchy was established, what with fighting, filibustering,
ind fríe bribery, there was but little real estate left in Society,
and since then, most of it's gone in keeping up appearances.
And the poorer we get, the fatter the British Republic grows.
There 's barrels of cash on that little dirt-heap."
"It 's curious we haven't heard from MANHATTAN," said the
Duchesa. "He's been over a fortnight in London, and only
cabled once."
"For a remittance," observed the Duke, drily, as he sent a
•olume of smoke through his nostrils. "But there, he 'e been
well received by PRESIDENT LABOUCHERE BURNS, and MANHATTAN
isn't the boy to waste his time in inspecting the Tower of London
and the British Museum. You know my intentions. He went
out as a speculation; and if he 's failed as a speculation, I
reckon we 've nothing else left to speculate with."

REALLY it is a mistake to imagine that
the mighty Metropolis is uninteresting
when deserted by most of its inhabitants.
Of course, Rotten Row is not quite itself
without horses; still, there are trees, and
now and again a watering-cart. True,
Bend Street looks a little bare without
pretty frocks and prettier faces; still,
there are omnibuses. And again, how de-
lightful it is to be able to wear a straw
h»t without attracting attention in Pic-
cadilly. And it is quite jolly to know that,
as scarcely a theatre is open, there is no
necessity to spoil one's dinner by haying
to rush off early to the play. Then, it is
quite an experience to be an honorary
member of some one else's club, because
your own Co-operative Palace is closed
for the annual cleaning. In fact, London
just now is simply delightful.
For all that, an invitation to join a
shooting party on the moors will not be
rejected.

THE REVIVAL OF ROMANCE.
[On July 17 a duel on bicycles took place in Paris.]
.... BY this time the sun was beginning to sink in the west,
and shone with a ruddy glow upon the vast assembly of fair
women and brave men assembled in the spacious grounds of
Diddledum Castle. The appearance of the ring testified to the
severity of the day's struggles; gallant steeds, that had cara-
coled with the best at the commencement of the tournament,
now lay prone on the ground, a pitiable mass of torn tyres and
splintered spokes, while the leeches who were present to tend
the wounded riders had long since exhausted their stock of
sticking-plaster, and had now perforce to make shift with post-
age-stamp paper. All day had the lists been set, and all day had
the intrepid Sir CLAUD POICTIBRS proved himself a champion
indeed. Knight after knight had essayed to do battle with him,
only quickly to be unbicycled by his lance, and to bite the
shameful dust.
From her seat in the gallery which surrounded the arena,
the young and beauteous Lady ANGELA LOLLIPOP had sur-
veyed the chances of the battle with a more than common inte-
rest. Well did she know that, in accordance with old-estab-
lished precedent, her hand waa to be bestowed upon him who
should prove the conqueror at the close of the day. Sir CLAUD
POICTIBRS she cordially detested. Where, oh where, was the
faithful ALGERNON UK BONCŒUR, who had promised to do battle
on her behalf, and for whom—especially as he was a director of
five bicycle companies—she felt the tenderest affection? Suddenly
the onlookers gave a start of excitement and surprise, as on their
ean fell the clear and resonant tones of an approaching bell!
Another moment, and there had ridden into the arena a mysteri-
ous knight, with his face closely masked. Disdaining to make
ing his lance in one hand, and applying the other with out-
stretched fingers to his nose, with a superb gesture of haughty
defiance. Lady ANGELA recognised the rider by his massive
calves, and fainted on the spot. "'Tie ALGERNON himself!"
she gasped.
The herald gave the signal. Once more resounded ALGER-
NON'S bell; once more Sir CLAUD'S squeaker blared forth
a hoarse defiance. With the speed of lightning the high-bred
bicycles whirled towards each other, with a resounding crash
they met in the midst of the ring. Sir CLAUD pursued the
tactics which had given him the victory earlier in the day, by
aiming a furious stroke at his rival's head, but ALGERNON ducked
with consummate grace at precisely the right moment, so that
Sir CLAUD fell headlong by the violence of his own blow and lay
prone on the arena. Even as he fell, ALGERNON had drawn back
his sharp-pointed lance, and plunged it twice with all his might
into the front tyre of the other's machine. A terrific explosion
was heard, and then the tyre crumpled up, flabby and useless.
A prolonged shout of applause arose from the onlookers.
"Hold!" spluttered Sir CLAUD, his mouth full of dust, "'tis
enough—my tyre is punctured; I can fight no more."
"Then," said the other, proudly, "I claim my lawful prize—
the Lady ANGELA I"
A gleam of malignant triumph flashed from Sir CLAUD'S eyes
as he rose with difficulty from the ground. "Nay." he said;
"not yet, young man. Know that I am a Justice of the Peace,
and hereby order thy instant arrest on the charge of furious
riding 1"
There was a moment of awful silence. And then, before the
spectators could realise what had happened, the Lady ANGELA
had vaulted lightly down into the arena, ALGERNON had raised
her in his arms and seated her on his handle-bar, he had
mounted and ridden off with his lovely prize, and knight, lady
use of his handles, he rode swiftly towards Sir CLAUD, brandish-
and bicycle had become a swiftly vanishing speck in the distance!

ARBORICULTURE.
Тнв other day, at Hawarden, Mr.

members of the English Arboricultural
Society. Mr. Punch, as usual interested
and instructed by the remarks of the en-
cycloptedic and right honourable gentle-
man, at once commanded his Chief Bo-
tanist to prepare a report on arboricul-
ture in the Metropolis. This official, as-

staff, has begun by a careful study of the
Haymarket, a region hitherto disregarded
by arboriculturists.

In the immediate vicinity of several

the Arbor bootii in an excellent state.
This is not the tree which produces
sandal wood.
On the east side, not far from Pall
Mall, two fine specimens of the Arbor
Beerbohmii were in a flourishing condi-
tion until recently. They are now being
conveyed around the provinces for exhi-
bition, and later on will be taken to the
United States. It is understood that
next year these two admirable trees will
be transplanted to the west side of the
street, where it is hoped that they will
come. As Mr GLADSTONB very truly re-
marked, "the people of this country
understand the ornamental management
of trees as well as anybody."
RAILWAY BALLADS.
THE MISSING SPINSTER.
Yon may boast your great improvements,
Your inventions and your "movements,"
For those who stay at home, and those
who travel;
But arrangements for the latter
Are so complex, that the matter
Makes them dotty as a hatter
To unravel.
There was once an ancient lady
Whom we knew as Miss O'GRADT,
Who was asked to spend the autumn
down at Trew.
So in fear and trepidation
She sought out her destination,
And betook her to the station—
Waterloo.
She took her little ticket
And she did not fail to stick it
With half-a-dozen coppers in her glove.
Another moment found her
With a plenty to astound her—
For she d notice-boards all round her,
And above!
So she studied every number
On those sign-posts that encumber
All the station; and she learned them
one by one;
But she found the indication
Of the platforms of the station
Not much use as information
When she'd done.
In her shocking state of fluster
Little courage could she muster,
Yet of porters she accosted one or two;
But, too shy to claim attention,
And too full of apprehension,
She could get no one to mention
"Which for Trew."
So she trudged through every station—
"North," я South," "Main,"—in quick
rotation,
And then she gave a trial to the
"Loop":
Like some hapless new Pandora
She sat down a-gasping for a
Little hope to live on—or a
Plate o' soup.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
MR. HENRY FROWDB has issued from the Clarendon Press, in
workmanlike style worthy of that institution's renown, Mr.
GLADSTONE'S Studies Subsidiary to the World of Bishop Butter.
The volume is uniform with the two that preceded it, containing
the works of Bishop BUTLBR, to the editing of which the veteran
statesman devoted the greater part of last year. Apart from their
intrinsic value, these three portly volumes have a rare personal

The Biirou de В.-ЛУ. und the First Page.
interest. In his eighty-sixth year, at the close of a life of almost
tumultuous labour, Mr. GLADSTONE bethought him that there
was something desirable to be done for the public good and
the wider fame of Bishop BUTLER. In earlier editions the
"Analogy" runs on through interminable pages without a break.
There are no indexes, few notes, and some doubt as to accuracy
of the text. To supply these needs was a task which, thoroughly
done, would seem to require youthful energy and prospect of
long life. Mr. GLADSTONE just sat down and did it. As he pro-
ceeded with his editorial work, thoughts crowded upon him
which he committed to paper. The notes grew in bulk 'till
they threatened to exceed the "Analogy" in volume. In the
end, Mr. GLADSTONE determined to make a volume of his own,
a book ablaze with the light of scholarly research. For more
than twenty years my Baronite has witnessed Mr. GLADSTONE'S
tours de force in other fields, and protests that, in all the
circumstances, production of these three volumes is the most
remarkable.
The anonymous author of Ifr. Magnus (FISHER UNWTN) has
evidently been disappointed with Air. CECIL RHODES, as other
students of phenomenal developments of nature have been dis-
appointed with the Atlantic. He "goes for" the fallen giant,
thinly disguised under the name that gives a title to the work.
The book, though spiteful, is clever, offering a vivid and highly-
coloured description of the way they live in Johannesburg. Mr.
BARNATO is sketched with a more friendly hand than is the ex-
Cape Premier. There are other portraits, which will doubtless
be recognised by members of the Reform Committee, now at
large and with leisure to read a sprightly book. Some passages,
notably those descriptive of a visit to the mine, and the subse-
quent accident, are written with a graphic power that suggest«
the author might safely trust to his literary skill to attract
readers without elaborating personal skit«.
In the latest Yellow Book for this quarter the art of telling
unfinished stories in a highly-finished style is carried well nigh
to perfection by Mr. HENRY HARLAND in his "Invisible Prince;"
and to a less'degree by M км к MURIEL DOWIB, in her "Idyll in
Millinery." MARIE CLOTHILDE BALFOUR chooses Zola-like sub-
jects; not pleasant reading. What of the weird, unintelligible,
Blake-like illustrations by J. HERBERT McNAiR? Prize-picture-
puzzles, which may possess some attraction for those who can
admire the trio of stnrk naked lunatics in the drawing by
LAURENCE HOUSMAN (shouldn't it be Mad-House-man ?), entitled
"Barren Life." There is an interesting paper on the " Sergeant-
at-law," by Mr. FRANCIS WATT. Among the sane pictures, that
of "Dieppe Castle," by D. Y. CAMERON, is effective; while the
two pictures of " III Omen" and "The Sleeping Prince," are in
every way hard to beat, even by LAURENCE MAD-HOUSMAN afore-
said. On the whole, the majority of "indolent reviewers" may
find some amusement in the Yellow Book issuing from the
"MY ENGAGEMENT."
Тнв following correspondence has overflowed from Fleet Street
into Bouverie Street :—
DEAR MR. EDITOR,—My fiancé says I 'm engaged to him, and
/ say he 's engaged to me—and that 's where the trouble is. It
makes all the difference in the world, I consider. I 'm not going
to be his chattel (or is it chattle ?) especially as I proposed to
him this year, as it 's leap year. So it's my show this time—I
mean my engagement, and I don't exactly see where he comes
in, except to be there, when he 's wanted. I 've always been
used to having my own way—that 's all I want, and I really do
wish he would once for all understand that I engage him, and
not the other way round. It would be so much simpler to start
right, and not have any words on the matter. I am always for
peace, and my nerves couldn't stand any difference of opinion.
If he only will just give way, everything will be lovely. He is
quite a boy, and doesn't know what is good for him, and is not
used to engaging anyone, not even a cook or a cabman. I am,
yours to command, MABTINETTA N. PECKER.
DEAR SIR,—I have been studying the interesting correspond-
ence, started by Mrs. ALIMONY in your columns, and should like
to put my own case before your readers. I was out the other
day with three lovely girls (not sisters), up the river I think it
was, and well—I somehow got mixed up coming home in the
twilight, and became engaged to one of them, but I can't for the
life of me remember which. It was getting dark at the time,
and I don't think I should recognise her again, and I forgot to
give her my address. I do not want to go to the wrong house,

I am sure I care very much for the girl, if I could only identify
her properly. I don't wish to lose her, whichever it was; but
I was always careless in these matters. Can one be sued for
absence of mind? Yours barmily, CRUMPET.
DEAR MR. EDITOR,—Sir, I am not exactly engaged, but at the
present moment am quite free to become so. I am looking for
a young lady, who must be beautiful, of good birth, domesti-
cated, smart, musical, artistic, a good dancer, horsewoman,
swimmer, skater, and tennis-player, good tempered, able to con-
verse in six languages, and having a thousand a year of her own.
Or I will commute all these qualifications for an income of
£3,750 per annum. I have a Loving Heart to give in exchange,
and the young lady may rely on my not wanting to break off
the engagement. What offers? FAIR 's FAIR.
SIR,—I am delighted to announce to you the happy achieve-
ment of our golden engagement. I met my fiancée in the
month of August, 1846, and fell madly in love with her on the
spot (like Homocea). I hadn't a penny then, and I haven't
now, but we plighted our troth at first sight, and have been in

early daguerreotype which I tenderly fondle. I am afraid to
meet her now, for fear of disillusionment.

ARBORICULTURE.
THE other day, at Hawarden, Mr.
GLADSTONE received and addressed the
members of the English Arboricultural
Society. Mr. Punch, as usual interested
and instructed by the remarks of the en-
cyclopedic and right honourable gentle-
man, at once commanded his Chief Bo-
tnnist to prepare a report on arboricul-
ture in the Metropolis. This official, as-
sisted by the Deputy Botaniste on his
staff, has begun by a careful study of the
Haymarket, a region hitherto disregarded
by arboriculturists.
He has discovered in the roadway the

seen in farm-yards, but one variety, A. a.
omnibiuiaceœ, is or large girth.
In the immediate vicinity of several
shoemakers shops there are varieties of
the Arbor bootii in an excellent state.
This is not the tree which produces
sandal wood.
On the east side, not far from Pall
Mall, two fine specimens of the Arbor
Beerbohmii were in a flourishing condi-
tion until recently. They are now being
conveyed around the provinces for exhi-
bition, and later on will be taken to the
United States. It is understood that
next year these two admirable trees will
be transplanted to the west side of the
street, where it is hoped that they will
come. As Mr GLADSTONE very truly re-
marked, "the people of this country
understand the ornamental management
of trees as well as anybody."

THE MISSING SPINSTER,
You may boast your great improvements,
Your inventions and your "movements,"
For those who stay at home, and those
who travel;
But arrangements for the latter
Are so complex, that the matter
Makes them dotty as a hatter
To unravel.
There was once an ancient lady
Whom we knew as Miss O'ORADT,
Who was asked to spend the autumn
down at Trew.
So in fear and trepidation
She sought out her destination,
And betook her to the station—
Waterloo.
She took her little ticket
And she did not fail to stick it
With half-a-dozen coppers in her glove.
Another moment found her
With a plenty to astound her—
For she d notice-boards all round her,
And above 1
So she studied every number
On those sign-posts that encumber
All the station; and she learned them
one by one;
Dut she found the indication
Of the platforms of the station
Not much use as information
When she 'd done.
In her shocking state of fluster
Little courage could she muster,
Yet of porters she accosted one or two;
But, too shy to claim attention,
And too full of apprehension,
She could get no one to mention
"Which for Trew."
So she trudged through every station—
"North," f South," "Main,"—in quick
rotation,
And then she gave a trial to the
"Loop":
Like some hapless new Pandora
She sat down a-gasping for a
Little hope to live on—or a

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
MR. HENRY FROWDE has issued from the Clarendon Press, in
workmanlike style worthy of that institution's renown, Mr.
GLADSTONE'S Studies Subsidiary to the Works of Bishop Butler.
The volume is uniform with the two that preceded it, containing
the works of Bishop BUTLBH, to the editing of which the veteran
statesman devoted the greater part of last year. Apart from their
intrinsic value, these three portly volumes have a rare personal

The Baron de B.-W. and the First Page.
interest. In his eighty-sixth year, at the close of a life of almost
tumultuous labour, Mr. GLADSTONE bethought him that there
was something desirable to be done for the public good and
the wider fame of Bishop BUTLER. In earlier editions the
"Analogy " runs on through interminable pages without a break.
There are no indexes, few notes, and some doubt as to accuracy
of the text. To supply these needs was a task which, thoroughly
done, would seem to require youthful energy and prospect of
long life. Mr. GLADSTONE just sat down and did it. As he pro-
ceeded with his editorial work, thoughts crowded upon nim
u hu'h he committed to paper. The notes grew in bulk 'till
they threatened to exceed the "Analogy" in volume. In the
end, Mr. GLADSTONE determined to make a volume of his own,
a book ablaze with the light of scholarly research. For more
than twenty years my Baronite has witnessed Mr. GLADSTONE'S
tours de force in other fields, and protests that, in all the
circumstances, production of these three volumes is the most
remarkable.
The anonymous author of Mr. Magnus (FISHER UNWIN) has
evidently been disappointed with Mr. CECIL RHODES, as other
students of phenomenal developments of nature have been dis-
appointed with the Atlantic. He "goes for" the fallen giant,
thinly disguised under the name that gives a title to the work.
The book, though spiteful, is clever, offering a vivid and highly-
coloured description of the way they live in Johannesburg. Mr.
BARNATO is sketched with a more friendly hand than is the ex-
Cape Premier. There are other portraits, which will doubtless
be recognised by members of the Reform Committee, now at
large and with leisure to read a sprightly book. Some passages,
notably those descriptive of a visit to the mine, and trie subse-
quent accident, are written with a graphic power that suggests
the author might safely trust to his literary skill to attract
readers without elaborating personal skits.
In the latest Yellow Book for this quarter the art of telling
unfinished stories in a highly-finished style is carried well nigh
to perfection by Mr. HENRY HARLAND in his "Invisible Ргшсег"
and to a less degree by MENIE MURIBL DOWIB, in her "Idyll m
Millinery." MARIE CLOTHILDE BALFOUR chooses Zola-like sub-
jects; not pleasant reading. What of the weird, unintelligible,
Blake-like illustrations by J. HERBERT McNAiR? Prize-picture-
puzzles, which may possess some attraction for those who can
admire the trio of stark naked lunatics in the drawing by
LAURENCE HOUSMAN (shouldn't it be Mad-House-man?), entitled
"Barren Life.." There is an interesting paper on the " Sergeant-
at-law," by Mr. FRANCIS WATT. Among the sane pictures, that
of "Dieppe Castle," by D. Y. CAMERON, is effective; while the
two pictures of " III Omen" and "The Steeping Prince," are in
every way hard to beat, even by LAURENCE MAD-HOUSMAN afore-
said. On the whole, the majority of "indolent reviewers" may
find some amusement in the Yellow Book issuing from the
"MY ENGAGEMENT."
THE following correspondence has overflowed from Fleet Street
into Bouverie Street : —
DEAR MR. EDITOR,—My flaneé says I 'm engaged to him, and
I say he 's engaged to me—and that 's where the trouble is. _ It
makes all the difference in the world, I consider. I 'm not going
to be his chattel (or is it chattle ?) especially as I proposed to
him this year, as it's leap year. So it's my show this time—I
mean my engagement, and I don't exactly see where he comes
in, except to be there, when he 's wanted. I 've always been
used to having my own way—that's all I want, and I really do
wish he would once for all understand that I engage him, and
not the other way round. It would be so much simpler to start
right, and not have any words on the matter. I am always for
peace, and my nerves couldn't stand any difference of opinion.
If he only will just give way, everything will be lovely. He is
quite a boy, and doesn't know what is good for him, and is not
used to engaging anyone, not even a cook or a cabman. I am,
yours to command, MARTINETTA N. PECKER.
DEAR SIR,—I have been studying the interesting correspond-
ence, started by Mrs. ALIMONY in your columns, and should like
to put my own case before your readers. I was out the other
day with three lovely girls (not sisters), up the river I think it
was, and well—I somehow got mixed up coming home in the
twilight, and became engaged to one of them, but I can't for the
life of me remember which. It was getting dark at the time,
and I don't think I should recognise her again, and I forgot to
give her my address. I do not want to go to the wrong house,
and be interviewed by the wrong father. So what am I to dp?
I am sure I care very much for the girl, if I could only identify
her properly. I don't wish to lose her, whichever it was; but
I was always careless in these matters. Can one be sued for
absence of mind? Yours barmily, CRUMPET.
DEAR MR. EDITOR,—Sir, I am not exactly engaged, but at the
present moment am quite free to become so. I am looking for
a young lady, who must be beautiful, of good birth, domesti-
cated, smart, musical, artistic, a good dancer, horsewoman,
swimmer, skater, and tennis-player, good tempered, able to con-
verse in six languages, and having a thousand a year of her own.
Or I will commute all these qualifications for an income of
£3,750 per annum. I have a Loving Heart to give in exchange,
and the young lady may rely on my not wanting to break off

DEAR MB. PUNCH,—I am insatiate in my desire for the latest
news, and buy papers literally from morning till night on every
week day. On Sunday, however, my craving for knowledge has
to be satisfied with one early supply of information. Among
other journals I always take in The People, and you may imagine
that I opened my eyes when I read in ite columns the following
paragraphs : —
"Four bombs were exploded under a train travelling between Navajas and
Jagüey. Four Cubans were budly injured, and several sustained slighter
injuries.
The Chevalier BAYARD, after having been mortally wounded, asked to be

"I may die facing the enemy."
Can it be that the knight "without fear or reproach" has re-
turned to earth, and is battling in Tobacco-land for the oppressed
islanders, or does the text refer to some descendant of his with
equally noble traits, who has died in resisting the tyrannical
might of Spain? I have vainly sought in the daily and weekly
Prese for a solution of the mystery. I therefore turn to you,
Sir, as the last, but by no means least, personage capable of
relieving my anxiety. Itching for your answer, I am, your
obedient servant, CHRISTOPHER МсСвиотАрн.
P.S.—I ought, perhaps, to mention that the Spanish Ambas-
sador's footman referred me to the porter at the American
Embassy, who assured me that his master had gone to Norway.

CHAPTER I.—" Nobilitatit virtia stcmma."
IT was a stormy evening in November, 1995. The rain was
beating in stormy gusts on the old brown stone palace in
Fifth Avenue, and there was a continual drip from the rusted
coronet over the "stoop" on to the well-worn marble steps below
the door, which showed sad need of the renovating brush of the
house-painter. Within, the aspect of the mansion was not more
cheerful. Want of comfort was evidently hand in hand with
want of money. In one of the principal sitting-rooms, remark-
able for the large collection of pictures hung on the walls, and
for several massive silver spittoons of nineteenth century work, a
lady and gentleman were seated before a small wood fire. By the
light of the solitary electro-burner it might have been perceived
that both were of mature years, and that each possessed that
aristocratic bearing, which is the heirloom of ancient lineage.
Yet it was evident that they were not in affluent circumstances.
The divided skirt of the dame, though scrupulously neat, had
certainly seen better days, her silken hose were not innocent
of darns, and the Brussels lace of her spotless white vest had
evidently been mended more than once, while her black velvet
jacket had on it a distinct touch of old-time rust. Still her
plentiful white locks were arranged in the latest fashion, that
of the pyramid, and though the long, taper fingers with which
she rolled a cigarette were unadorned with jewelled rings,
yet they were as perfectly shaped as the toes of that legendary
'Гi ¡Hin, whose fame has been handed down to us from the last
century. The gentleman's suit of Tartan broadcloth was none
of the freshest either in cut or material, and the woollen scarf
girt around his neck was clearly worn for warmth rather than
effect. Nevertheless, his thick grey moustache was heavily
waxed, and his broad chest was crossed with the somewhat
taded tricolour riband of the proudest order of American Chivalry
—the Everlasting Eagle. He was smoking some very pungent
tobacco from a long clay pipe, and ever and anon he slaked his
thirst from a beaker of lager beer standing by his side. From
the working of the muscles of his rubicund face it was apparent
that he was violently moved by his thoughts. Presently the
lady broke silence and observed, "So the Emperor will do
nothing?"
"Absolutely nothing," replied her companion, with a sigh.
"He has forgotten the days when it was a question whether an
O'FLAHERTY or a VANPKRKBN was the better fitted to grasp the
sceptre of a rising young monarchy. But what," he continued,
bitterly. "did an American ever get from an Irishman but in-
gratitude? And so I made bold to tell the Prince of TAMMANY
to-day."
"You told him so 1" cried the lady, with admiration in her
glance. "That was like a true VANPERKEN, and as became the
Duke of SARATOGA. I guess he squirmed, though."
"You are right," answered the Duke, draining his goblet.
"But no amount of princely squirming will bring dollars to our
cash-box. The pictures will have to go, so I 've telephoned
MACLAZARUS to come and take the lot this very evening. It can't
be helpsd, SUSIE," he added, tenderly, as he saw the teardrops
glisten in her eyes.
"It does seem downright cruel," murmured the Duchess,
passing the back of her hand over her vision. "It 's woeful,"
she continued, "what we of the Peerage are coming to nowa-
days."
"That's so," remarked the Duke, filling his pipe. "But it
might have been reckoned on by our forefathers, who were so
crazy to have then- daughters married to European titles that
they sent billions of money across the Atlantic. When the Im-
perial Monarchy was established, what with fighting, filibustering,
and frac bribery, there was but little real estate left in Society,
and since then, most of it's gone in keeping up appearances.
And the poorer we get, the fatter the British Republic grows.
There 's barrels of cash on that little dirt-heap."
11 It 's curious we haven't heard from MANHATTAN," said the
Duchess. "He 's been over a fortnight in London, and only
cabled once."
"For a remittance," observed the Duke, drily, as he sent a
volume of smoke through his nostrils. "But there, he 's been
well received by PRESIDENT LABOUCHERE BURNS, and MANHATTAN
isn't the boy to waste his time in inspecting the Tower of London
and the British Museum. You know my intentions. He went
out as a speculation; and if he 's failed as a speculation, I
reckon we've nothing else left to speculate with."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

WHERE IGNORANCE IS BLISS, &c.
Janet. "I SAY, WHAT'S THE EXACT MEANING OF 'VOILA'?"
Brown. "WELL, I SHOULD TRANSLATE IT AS 'BEHOLD,' OR 'THERE
YOU ARE,' OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT."
Jones. "CONFOUND IT! I 'VE BEEN USING IT FOR THE LAST MONTH
AND THINKING I 4'E BEEN SWEARING IN FRENCH!"
UP-TO-DATE INTELLIGENCE—RE BAYARD.
DEAR MB. PUNCH,—I am insatiate in my desire for the latest
news, and buy papers literally from morning till night on every
week day. On Sunday, however, my craving for knowledge has
to be satisfied with one early supply of information. Among
other journals I always take in The Peo fie, and you may imagine
that I opened my eyes when I read in its columns the following
paragraphs : —
"Four bombs were exploded under a train travelling between Navajos and
Joquey. Four Cubans were badly injured, and several sustained slighter
injuries.
The Chevalier BAYARD, after having been mortally wounded, asked to be
taken from his horse and placed at the foot of a tree. "At least," said lie,
"I may die facing the enemy."
Can it be that the knight "without fear or reproach" has re-
turned to earth, and is battling in Tobacco-land for the oppressed
islanders, or does the text refer to some descendant of his with
equally noble traits, who has died in resisting the tyrannical
might of Spain? I have vainly sought in the daily and weekly
Press for a solution of the mystery. I therefore turn to you,
Sir, as the last, but by no means least, personage capable of
relieving my anxiety. Itching for your answer, I am, your
obedient servant, CHRISTOPHER McCENOTAPH.
P.S.—I ought, perhaps, to mention that the Spanish Ambas-
sador's footman referred me to the porter at the American
Embassy, who assured me that his master had gone to Norway.
THE ASTRONOMERS WHO FAILED.—Some of the lucky ones were
favoured with a sight of King Sol's corona and stars of various
orders. "Only this and nothing more."

CHAPTER I.—" Nobiiitatis virtus stemma."
IT was a stormy evening in November, 1995. The rain was
beating in stormy gusts on the old brown stone palace in
Fifth Avenue, and there wae a continual drip from the rusted
coronet over the "stoop" on to the well-worn marble steps below
the door, which showed sad need of the renovating brush of the
house-painter. Within, the aspect of the mansion was not more
cheerful. Want of comfort was evidently hand in hand with
want of money. In one of the principal sitting-rooms, remark-
able for the large collection of pictures hung on the walls, and
for several massive silver spittoons of nineteenth century work, a
lady and gentleman were seated before a small wood fire. By the
light of the solitary electro-burner it might, have been perceived
that both were of mature years, and t lint each possessed that
aristocratic bearing, which is the heirloom of ancient lineage.
Yet it was evident that they were not in affluent circumstances.
The divided skirt of the dame, though scrupulously neat, had
certainly seen better days, her silken hose were not innocent
of darns, and the Brussels lace of her spotless white vest had
evidently been mended more than once, while her black velvet
jacket had on it a distinct touch of old-time rust. Still her
plentiful white locks were arranged in the latest fashion, that
of the pyramid, and though the long, taper fingers with which
she rolled a cigarette were unadorned with jewelled rings,
yet they were as perfectly shaped as the toes of that legendary
Trilby, whose fame has been handed down to us from the last
century. The gentleman's suit of Tartan broadcloth was none
of the freshest either in cut or material, and the woollen scarf
girt around his neck was clearly worn for warmth rather than
effect. Nevertheless, hie thick grey moustache was heavily
waxed, and his broad chest was crossed with the somewhat
taded tricolour riband of the proudest order of American Chivalry
—the Everlasting Eagle, lie was smoking some very pungent
tobacco from a long clay pipe, and ever and anon he slaked his
thirst from a beaker of lager beer standing by his side. From
the working of the muscles of his rubicund face it was apparent
that he was violently moved by his thoughts. Presently the
lady broke silence and observed, "So the Emperor will do
nothing?"
"Absolutely nothing," replied her companion, with a sigh.
"He has forgotten the days when it was a question whether an
O'FLAHIIKTY or a VANPERKEN was the better fitted to grasp the
sceptre of a rising young monarchy. But what," he continued,
bitterly. "did an American ever get from an Irishman but in-
gratitude? And so I made bold to tell the Prince of TAMMANY
to-day."
"You told him so!" cried the lady, with admiration in her
glance. "That was like a true VANPBRKEN, and as became the
Duke of SARATOGA. I guess he squirmed, though."
"You are right," answered the Duke, draining his goblet.
"But no amount of princely squirming will bring dollars to our
cash-box. The pictures will have to go, so I've telephoned
,\1л< l.A/.uus to come and take the lot this very evening. It can't
be helped, SUSIE," he added, tenderly, as he saw the teardrops
glisten in her eyes.
"It does seem downright cruel," murmured the Duchess,
passing the back of her hand over her vision. "It's woeful,"
she continued, "what we of the Peerage are coming to nowa-
days."
"That's so," remarked the Duke, filling his pipe. "But it
might have been reckoned on by our forefathers, who were so
crazy to have their daughters married to European titles that
;hey sent billions of money across the Atlantic. \Vhen the Im-
perial Monarchy was established, what with fighting, filibustering,
xnd frae bribery, there was but little real estate left in Society,
and since then, most of it 's gone in keeping up appearances.
And the poorer we get, the fatter the British Republic grows.
There 's barrels of cash on that little dirt-heap."
"It's curious we haven't heard from MANHATTAN," said the
Duchess. "He 's been over a fortnight in London, and only
cabled once."
"For a remittance," observed the Duke, drily, as he sent a
volume of smoke through his nostrils. "But there, he 's been
well received by PRESIDENT LABOTJCHERE BOTINS, and MANHATTAN
sn't the boy to waste his time in inspecting the Tower of London
and the British Museum. You know my intentions. He went
out as a speculation; and if he 's failed as a speculation, I
reckon we 've nothing else left to speculate with."

How to follow them both is a riddle!

They have made room, anyhow. Now

It certainly would increase the pleasure
of the voyage if I could find a seat any-

Hope it doesn't take us for a torpedo.

GOOD NEWS AFTER THE LAST CRICKET
THE TRAVELLING CHINEE.
(By a British Manufacturer, n fier Bret Harlr..)

WELL. I wish to remark—
And I 'm putting it plain—
That for keeping things dark,
And for making tricks vain,
The travelling Chinee is peculiar—
And I 've tried all the furrineer strain.
Li HUNO CHANO is his name,
Though some papers deny,
In regard to the same,
\Vhat that name might imply.
Be it CHONO, CHANG or CHUNG, TONG or
POKKH,
It don't make much difference—he 's
fly!
It was August the third
When he first saw our skies;
And it might be inferred
We had landed a prize,
And would also land orders—in plenty;
But prophecy 's always unwise!
We had each our small game,
And Li HUNG took a hand.
We speak English; the same
He does not understand.
His interpreter does, and he questioned
Through him in a way that was grand!
As to "wanting to know,"
CLBNNAM'S self was not in it I
CHANG'S questions would flow
About twenty per minute;
And if catechisms the cake took,
I 'm certain the Chinese would win it.
Our shops were all stocked
In a way which I grieve
That he—silently—mocked,
With a laugh—in his sleeve;
And a Chinaman's sleeves are capacious
Beyond what you 'd really believe.
But as to a trade
With that Travelling Chinee—
Why, the most that we made
Are, so far as I see,
A sewing machine and a lawn tent,
Which the same were delivered him—
free!
Ships and guns were all nigh,
Which he gazed on with glee,
But was not moved to buy.
And I said, "Can this be?
I fear it is not many orders
We '11 get from this Travelling Chinee''
Which is why I remark—
And I put it quite plain—
That for riddles most dark,
And for questions quite vain,
The Travelling Chinee is a caution,
CHANO.
But orders from him do not rain 1
MATCH.—Rest for the wicket.

BOUND ABOUT READINGS.
STRAY NOTES ON WOMEN.
SCHOPENHAUER has, if I remember rightly, some very deprecia*-
tory remarks on women in general. His light and cheerful
works do not form part of my travelling library, and I am there-
fore unable to quote from them word for word, which I should
naturally do merely in order to controvert his shocking views.
So far as my recollection serves me, however, he denies to
woman beauty of face, grace of form, and intellect, and sends
her out into the world stripped of every vestige of the admirable
qualities with which the adoration of man has invested her
during all the years that have passed since EVE startled the
awaking ADAM into the first mariage de convenance of which
any record has come down to us.
I NEED not imitate the pessimist German by spreading any
accusations I may make over so wide a field. Something may
be conceded to women. They prepare shooting lunches with
admirable care, and a lavish expenditure of jam—an excellent
thing in woman and one much appreciated by the wearied
bringer down of grouse. They can pour out tea at breakfast,
and towards the end of a week's visit, may be counted upon to
remember that you take or do not take sugar. They can leave
cards on friends who have left cards on you; they can wisily
spend an hour on dressing or adorning themselves, a feat of
which few men in these degenerate days are capable. They can
organise picnics, and actually take pleasure in them when wasps
are not too numerous. They can, as young girls, manufacture
a secret out of nothing, and then talk it over with other girls
in corners to an accompaniment of mysterious gigglings, and to
the exclusion of rude, intrusive boys. They can run long hat-
pins, apparently, through the very middle of their heads, with-
out doing themselves the least harm, and they can coax a five-
pound note, or a bicycle, or a photographic camera out of an
indulgent parent in less time than it takes a son to obtain ten
shillings. All this and many other things they can do—but
th.,'y cannot steer a pleasure-boat on the Thames.
AND here I shall be met with indignant denials from various
quarters. One objector will cite to me the case of MILLIOENT,
who steered her brother to victory at the Gorehead Regatta. I
remember her well. Her sleeves were tucked up above her
elbows, she wore a lovely pink sash, and as her panting brother
churned the silvery current into foam with his sculls she bobbed
backwards and 'forwards in a manner traditionally associated
with coxswains, and first yelled her encouragement to her
brother, and then her defiance at ANGELA^ who, in a rival boat,
was steering her cousin over two sides of innumerable triangles.
Yes, MILLICENT was undoubtedly a success—but then MILLICENT
is an exception. Then there was NELLIE, a sylph-like figure, with
a straw hat perched jauntily on the top of her fair locks, and
the prettiest pair of little brown-leather shoes on her shapely feet.
I can see them still, aye, and in imagination hold them as I
place them one after another carefully on the back-bone of the
boat, and help their owner into her seat. NKI.I.IE steered a
racing-boat, she ran into no banks, and when the occasion re-
quired, she shouted "Look ahead" with a vigour that cleared
pur course as if by magic. NKI.I.IK was a triumph, but she, too,
is an exception. I speak not of M i I.I.HT.NT or NKLLIB, but of the
average woman who goes on water parties. The average woman
cannot steer.
OBSERVE her as she gets into the boat. Her attendant swains
are in their places at stroke and bow; another girl has been
wedged into the bows. The steerer instáis herself, and thus
addresses her crew as they push off: —
"Now, on which side ought I to sit? I think I could see
better on the right side. There, will that do? Oh, but if I sit
in the middle I can't see anything. Ought I to pull both strings
very hard like this? Why, they won't move at all. But if I
pull the left string we go to the left, and I 'm sure that 's wrong,
because I 've always heard that you ought to pull the other
string. Well, never mind; we 're getting along very nicely,
and catching up the other boat. Oh, oh, there 's a boat coming
the other way—which side ought we to go? They 're rowing
right into us. Oh, do stop. . . . There, I knew the silly man
would run into us. He needn't have looked so angry %bout
getting a ridiculous little bit of wood broken off his oar. Why
didn't he look round and watch where he was going? I do lore
this rocking about, don't you, Mr. HARRISON? Do try and
keep close to the steam-launch. What? It makes rowing so
uncomfortable? Well, you men are funny. ... I don't think
it was my fault wo ran into the bank, for I was pulling the left

They have made room, anyhow. Now

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
STKAY NOTES ON WOMEN.
SCHOPENHAUER has, if I remember rightly, some very deprecia-
tory remarks on women in general. His light and cheerful
works do not form part of my travelling library, and I am there-
fore unable to quote from them word for word, which I should
naturally do merely in order to controvert his shocking views.
So far as my recollection serves me, however, he déniée to
woman beauty of face, grace of form, and intellect, and sends
her out into the world stripped of every vestige of the admirable
qualities with which the adoration of man has invested her
during all the years that have passed since EVB startled the
awaking ADAM into the first mariage de convenance of which
any record has come down to us.
I NEED not imitate the pessimist German by spreading any
accusations I may make over so wide a field. Something may
be conceded to women. They prepare shooting lunches with
admirable care, and a lavish expenditure of jam—an excellent
thing in woman and one much appreciated by the wearied
bringer down of grouse. They can pour out tea at breakfast,
and towards the end of a week's visit, may be counted upon to
remember that you take or do not take sugar. They can leave
cards on friends who have left cards on you; they can easily
spend an hour on dressing or adorning themselves, a feat of
which few men in these degenerate days are capable. They can
organise picnics, and actually take pleasure in them when wasps
are not too numerous. They can, as young girls, manufacture
a secret out of nothing, and then talk it over with other girls
in corners to an accompaniment of mysterious gigglings, and to
the exclusion of rude, intrusive boys. They can run long hat-
pins, apparently, through the very middle of their heads, with-
out doing themselves the least harm, and they can coax a five-
pound note, or a bicycle, or a photographic camera out of an
indulgent parent in less time than it takes a son to obtain ten
shillings. All this and many other things they can do—but
thoy cannot steer a pleasure-boat on the Thames.
AND here I shall be met with indignant denials from various
quarters. One objector will cite to me the case of MILLICSNT,
who steered her brother to victory at the Gorehead Regatta. I
remember her well. Her sleeves were tucked up above her
elbows, she wore a lovely pink sash, and as her panting brother
churned the silvery current into foam with his sculls she bobbed
backwards and 'forwards in a manner traditionally associated
with coxswains, and first yelled her encouragement to her
brother, and then her defiance at A NCK.I.A, who, in a rival boat,
was steering her cousin over two sides of innumerable triangles.
Yes, MILLICENT was undoubtedly a success—but then MILLICENT
is an exception. Then there was NELLIE, a sylph-like figure, with
a straw hat perched jauntily on the top of her fair locks, and
the prettiest pair of little brown-leather shoes on her shapely feet.
I can see them still, aye, and in imagination hold them as I
place them one after another carefully on the back-bone of the
boat, and help their owner into her seat. NELLIE steered a
racing-boat, she ran into no banks, and when the occasion re-
quired, she shouted "Look ahead" with a vigour that cleared
pur course as if by magic. NELLIE was a triumph, but she, too,
is an exception. I speak not of MILLICENT or NELLIE, but of the
average woman who goes on water parties. The average woman
cannot steer.
OBSERVE her as ehe gets into the boat. Her attendant swains
are in their places at stroke and bow; another girl has been
wedged into the bows. The steerer instáis herself, and thus
addressee her crew as they push off : —
"Now, on which side ought I to sit? I think I could see
better on the right side. There, will that do? Oh, but if I sit
in the middle I can't see anything. Ought I to pull both strings
very hard like this? Why, they won't move at all. But if I
pull the left string we go to the left, and I 'm sure that 's wrong,
because I 've always heard that you ought to pull the other
string. Well, never mind; we 're getting along very nicely,
and catching up the other boat. Oh, oh, there 's a boat coming
the other way—which side ought we to go? They 're rowing
right into us. Oh, do stop. . . . There, I knew the silly man
would run into us. He needn't have looked so angry about
getting a ridiculous little bit of wood broken off his oar. Why
didn't he look round and watch where he was going? I do lore
this rocking about, don't you, Mr. HARRISON? Do try and
keep close to the steam-launch. What? It makes rowing so
uncomfortable? Well, you men are funny. ... I don't think
it was my fault wo ran into the bank, for I was pulling the left
string as hard as I could. That was the reason, was it? Of

To sixteen I lace in my new corset.
But others declare
"Have room and to spare,
For Venus of Milo 's the fashion—
You '11 look far more fair
With no stays and not even a sash on!"
So I wish that I knew
Which mode to pursue—
How to follow them both is a riddle!
Many inches and few,
They're rival extremes for my middle.
Well, if I were wise,
I 'd completely despise
The corsetiere and her fiat,
And wear my oicn size,
That's Nature's—and "Art" I'd fight
shy at!
NOMENCLATURE. — The professional

[See complainte in the papent and reports of some
police cases.]
As you say, it is just the sort of day
to enjoy a trip down the river to Mar-
gate. Hardly a ripple on the water, just
a touch of north in the air, and—hullo!
is this Tilbury already?
They ought really to make this landing-
stage a little bigger. Do you think there
will be room for all these people on the
boat?
They have made room, anyhow. Now
that we are all on board, I am quite con-
vinced that there are one or two hundred
in excess of the proper number of passen-
gers.
It certainly would increase the pleasure
of the voyage if I could find a seat any-
where, or even a spare bit of bulwark to
lean against.
What's that vessel coming up behind
at such a rate? A torpedo-destroyer?
Hope it doesn't take us for a torpedo.
Looks as though it would run us down in
another minute. Why doesn't our cap-
tain get out of the way?—the idiot!
"Wants to get in the way," did you
say ?" Because that is a faster steamer
belonging to a rival line, and our captain
does not intend to allow it to pass us?"
But, I say, it 's fearfully dangerous! 'Bu»
racing in streets bad enough, but a triflt
to this. Wonder if I could bribe Captain
to put me on shore at Sheerness?
Awful shave, that last! "Come and
have some dinner?" Couldn't touch a
thing while this is going on. Wish my
doctor could see me now; he ordered me
to avoid all excitement because of weak-
ness of my heart! Here she comes at us
«train! Missed us by a yard, by George!
Why, this is worse than a battle!
At Margate at last! Feel ten years
older. Heart beating wildly. Had no
food for eight hours! Can't eat now!
'' Excellent seamanship on part of our cap-
П-iin to get in first?" Solely due to the
Christian forbearance of the boat behind
in not rammine us. "Captain ought to
have a medal?" Ought to have six
months, you mean. And some lively
•pickpocket on board has stolen my purse.
T find !" Not the first time that sort of
thing has happened on these steamers?"
No, but it's the last time it will happen to
me on them. What an ass I was not to
come down by train!

GOOD NEWS AFTBR THE LAST CRICKET
THE TRAVELLING CHINEE.
(By a Bruish Manufacturer, after Bret Hartr.. )

WELL. I wish to remark—
And I 'm putting it plain—
That for keeping things dark,
And for making tricks vain,
The travelling Chinee is peculiar—
And I 've tried all the furrineer strain.
Li HUNO CHANO is his name,
Though some papers deny,
In regard to the same,
^yhat that name might imply.
Be it CHONO, CHANG or CHUNO, TONO or
POKER,
It don't make much difference—he 's
toi
It was August the third
When he first saw our skies;
And it might be inferred
We had landed a prize,
And would also land orden—in plenty;
But prophecy 's always unwise 1
We had each our small game,
And Li HTJNG took a hand.
We speak English; the same
Нк does not understand.
His interpreter does, and he questioned
Through him in a way that was grand!
As to "wanting to know,"
CLENNAM'S self was not in it!
CHANQ'S questions would flow
About twenty per minute;
And if catechisms the cake took,
I 'm certain the Chinese would win it.
Our shops were all stocked
In a way which I grieve
That he—silently—mocked,
With a laugh—in his sleeve;
And a Chinaman's sleeves are capacious
Beyond what you 'd really believe.
But as to a trade
With that Travelling Chinee-
Why, the most that we made
Are, so far as I see,
A sewing machine and a lawn tent,
Which the same were delivered him—
free!
Ships and guns were all nigh,
Which he gazed on with glee,
But was not moved to buy.
And I said, "Can this be?
I fear it is not many orders
We '11 get from this Travelling Chinee''
Which is why I remark—
And I put it quite plain—
That for riddles most dark,
And for questions quite vain,
The Travelling Chinee is a caution,
CHANO.
But orders from him do not rain I
MATCH.—Rest for the wicket.

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
STRAY NOTES ON WOMEN.
SCHOPENHAUER has, if I remember rightly, some тегу deprecia-
tory remarks on women in general. His light and cheerful
works do not form part of my travelling library, and I am there-
fore unable to quote from them word for word, which I should
naturally do merely in order to controvert his shocking views.
So far as my recollection serves me, however, he déniée to
woman beauty of face, grace of form, and intellect, and sends
her out into the world stripped of every vestige of the admirable
qualities with which the adoration of man has invested her
during all the years that have passed since EVE startled the
awaking ADAM into the first mariage de convenance of which
any record has come down to us.
I NEBD not imitate the pessimist German by spreading any
accusations I may make over so wide a field. Something may
be conceded to women. They prepare shooting lunches with
admirable care, and a lavish expenditure of jam—an excellent
thing in woman and one much appreciated by the wearied
bringer down of grouse. They can pour out tea at breakfast,
and towards the end of a week's visit, may be counted upon to
remember that you take or do not take sugar. They can leave
cards on friends who have left cards on you; they can cosily
spend an hour on dressing or adorning themselves, a feat of
which few men in these degenerate days are capable. They can
organise picnics, and actually take pleasure in them when wasps
are not too numerous. They can, as young girls, manufacture
a secret out of nothing, and then talk it over with other girls
in corners to an accompaniment of mysterious gigglings, and to
the exclusion of rude, intrusive boys. They can run long hat-
pins, apparently, through the very middle of their heads, with-
out doing themselves the least harm, and they can coax a five-
ponnd note, or a bicycle, or a photographic camera out of an
indulgent parent in less time than it takes a son to obtain ten
shillings. All this and many other things they can do—but
thoy cannot steer a pleasure-boat on the Thames.
AND here I shall be met with indignant denials from Tarions
quarters. One objector will cite to me the case of MILLICENT,
who steered her brother to victory at the Gorehead Regatta. I
remember her well. Her sleeves were tucked up above her
elbows, she wore a lovely pink sash, and as her panting brother
churned the silvery current into foam with his sculls she bobbed
backwards and "forwards in a manner traditionally associated
with coxswains, and first yelled her encouragement to her
brother, and then her defiance at Л NCKI.A, who, in a rival boat,
was steering her cousin over two sides of innumerable triangles.
Yee, MILLICENT was undoubtedly a success—but then MILLICENT
is an exception. Then there was NKI.I.I к, a sylph-like figure, with
a straw hat perched jauntily on the top of her fair locks, and
the prettiest pair of little brown-leather shoes on her shapely feet.
I can see them still, aye, and in imagination hold them as I
place them one after another carefully on the back-bone of the
boat, and help their owner into her seat. NELLIE steered a
racing-boat, she ran into no hanks, and when the occasion re-
quired, she shouted "Look ahead" with a vigour that cleared
pur course as if by magic. NELLIE was a triumph, but she, too,
is an exception. I speak not of MILLICENT or NELLIE, but of the
average woman who goes on water parties. The average woman
cannot steer.
OBSERVE her as she gets into the boat. Her attendant swains
are in their placea at stroke and bow; another girl has been
wedged into the bows. The steerer instáis herself, and thus
addressee her crew as they push off: —
"Now, on which side ought I to sit? I think I could ee_e
better on the right side. There, will that do? Oh, but if I sit
in the middle I can't see anything. Ought I to pull both strings
very hard like this? Why, they won't move at all. But if I
pull the left string we go to the left, and I 'm sure that 'в wrong,
because I 've always heard that you ought to pull the other
string. Well, never mind; we 're getting along very nicely,
and catching up the other boat. Oh, oh, there 's a boat coming
the other way—which aide ought we to go? They 're rowing
right into us. Oh, do stop. . . . There, I knew the silly roan
would run into us. He needn't have looked so angry ibout
getting a ridiculous little bit of wood broken off his oar. Why
didn't he look round and watch where he was going? I do lore
this rocking about, don't you, Mr. HARRISON? Do try and
keep close to the steam-launch. What? It makes rowing so
uncomfortable P Well, you men are funny. ... I don't think
it was my fault we ran into the bank, for I was pulling the left
string as hard as I could. That was the reason, was it? Of
course, I forgot. Now let me see; what ought you to do when
you come to a lock? I know you dp something with boat-hooks
or whistles. ALICE, can you whistle? No? I dare say it
doesn't matter; the man will have to open all the same. Why
did that woman glare at me so? She needn't think it makes her
look pretty, became it doesn't. Oh, do take care, please do. Why
is all that water pouring into the lock? There, I knew we
should get en. lied. They oughtn't to be in such a hurry. Be-
sides, it wouni be much simpler to open both sets of gates .at
each end together, and then we could slip through without all
this fuss and bother. No, thank you, Mr. HARRISON, I |m not
a bit tired. I could go on steering all day in this delightful
weather. Now, why did we stick in the bank that time? Why,
I 've dropped the string. Well, I suppose one can't always do
things perfectly."
Said Khalid's Lament.
[Admiral EAWSON bombarded Zanzibar lit 9 A.M., August 27.]
WHAT was the use of cannon? what was the use of words?
We could not come to terms,
For RAWSON was one of the early birds
And I was one of the worms.

JOTTINGS AND TITTLINGS.
(By BABOO HURRY BUNOSHO JABBERJEE, B.A.)
No. XXII.
Mr. Jabberjee places himself in the hands of a solicitor—with certain
reservations.
I CONCLUDED my foregoing instalment, narrating my service of
a writ for breaching a promise of marriage, with a spirited out-
burst of insouciance and devilmaycarefulness.

"Would be greatly improved by the simple addition of some knce-cape."
But such courage of a Dutch evaporated deplorably on closer
perusal of the said writ, which contained the peremptory man-
date that I was to enter my appearance withm the incredibly
short notice of eight days, or the judgment would be given in
my absence!
Now it was totally out of the question that I was to prepare
a long complicated defence, and have the requisite witnesses,
and also perfect myself in the customs and etiquettes of Common
Law Procedure, all in such a ridiculously brief period; and yet,
if I remained perdu with a hidden head, I could not hope for
even the minimum of justice, since, heigh-ho I les absents ont
a spanked child, to find myself confronting such a devil of a
deep sea, and my day was dismal and my night a nonentity,
until, by a great piece of potluck, on going up the next morning
to the library of my Inn, I espied my young friend HOWARD in
the compound, busily employed in a lawn tennis game.
Having partially poured the cat from my bag already into
his sympathetic and receptive bosom, 1 decided to confide to
him my hard case in its entirety, and so made him a secret sign
that I desired some private confabulations at his earliest con-
veniencv, which he observing, after the termination of the
match, came towards the remote bench whereon I was forlornly
moping, and sat down kindly by my side.
This young Л LLBUTT-lNNE'iT, I am to mention here, had only
just missed succeeding in the passing of Bar Exam owing to the
inveterate malignancy of his stars and lack of a more industrial
temperament; but from the coolness of his cheek, and complete
man-of-the-worldliness, is a most judicious and tip-top adviser
to friends in tight places.
Experto crede, for, when he had heard the latest particulars of
my shocking imbroglio, he promptly gave me the excellent ad-
vice that I was to consult a solicitor; strongly recommending a
Mr. SIDNEY SHABTLB, who was a former schoolmate of hie own,
and a good thundering chap, and who (he thought) was not во
overburdened as yet by legal business that he could not find
time for working the oracle on my behalf.
"And look here, JAB," he added (he has sometimes the extreme
condescension to address me as an abbreviation), "I'll trot you
up to him at once—and I say, A 1 .idea 1 tell him you mean to be
your own counsel, and do all the speechifying yourself. Native
prince, in brand-new wig and gown, defending himself single-
handed from wiles of artful adventuress—why, you '11 knock the
jury as if with old boots I"
"Alack," said I, sorrowfully; "though I am quite competent
to become the stump orator at shortest notice, I do not see how
I can enter my first appearance until I have carefully instructed
Misters RAM and JALPANYBHOY in the evidence they are to give
and leave untold, Ac., and a week is too scanty and fugitive a
period for such preparations I"
"Nonsense and stuff I" he replies, "you will have a lot more
than that, since the week only applies to entering an appearance
—which is a mere farcical formality that old SID can perform in
your place on his head." At which I was greatly relieved.
But on arrival at Mr. SMABTLE'B office in Chancery Lane, we
were disappointed to be informed, by a small, juvenile clerk, that
he was absent at Wimbledon on urgent professional affairs, and
his return was the unknown quantity. However, after waiting
till close upon tke hour of tiffin, he unexpectedly turned up in
a suit of knickerbockers, carrying a long, narrow bag full of
metal-headed rods, and although rather adolescent than senile
in physical .appearance I was vastly impressed by the offhanded
cocksurety of his manner.
My friend HOWARD introduced me, and exhibited my doleful
predicament in the shell of a nut, whereupon Mr. SMARTLB
jauntily pronounced it to be the common garden breach of
g'omise, but that we had better all repair to the First Avenue
otel and lunch, and talk the affair over afterwards.
Which we did in the smoking-room after lunch, with coffee,
liqueurs, and cigars, «fee., for which I had to pay, as a Tommy
Dod, and the odd man out of pocket.
Mr. SUABTLB, after listening attentively to my narrative,
said that I certainly seemed to him to have let myself into the
deuced cavity of a hole by so publicly proclaiming my engage-
ment, but that my status as an oriental foreigner, and the fact
I had asserted—viz., that my promise was extorted from me by
compulsion and sheer physical funkiness—might pull me through,
unless, the plaintiff were of superlative loveliness (which, fortu-
nately, is by no means the case).
He added, that we had better engage WITHBBINOTON, Q.C., ai
he was notoriously the Grossest examiner at the Common Bar.
But to this I opposed the sine qua non that I am to have the
sole control of my case in court, and reap the undivided kudos,
assuring him that I should be able to cross-examine all witnesses
until they could not stand on one leg. From some private
motives of his own, he sought to overcome my determination,
hinting that, as my calling and election to the Bar were not yet
an ancient history, I might not possess sufficient experience;
and moreover that, by appearing in barristerial garbage, I should
infallibly forfeit the indulgence shown by a judge to ordinary
litigants; to which I responded by pointing out that I was a
typical Indian in the matter of legal sublety and ready-made
wit, and that, if not capable of conducting my own case, how,
then, could I be fit to undertake a logomachy for any third
toujours tort. So that I shed blistering and scalding tears like
parties P finally, that it is proverbially unnecessary to keep a

dog when you are equally proficient in the practice of barking
yourself.
Whereupon, silenced by my a fortiori and reductio ad ab-
surdum, he gave way, saying that it was my own affair, and,
anyhow, there would be plenty of time to consider such a matter,
since the plaintiff might not choose to do anything further till
after the Long Vacation, and we could easily postpone the hear-
ing of the action until the Midsummer of next year.
I, however, earnestly protested that I did not wish so pro-
crastinated a delay, as I desired to make my forensic diibut at
the earliest possible moment, and urged him to leave no stone
unturned to get the job finished by November at least, suggest-
ing that if we could ascertain the name and address of the
judge who was to try the case, I might call upon him, and, in a
private and confidential interview, ascertain the extent of his
disposition in my favour, and the length of his foot.
To which Mr. SMAKTLE replied that he could not recommend
any such tactics, as I should certainly ascertain the dimensions
of the judicial foot in a literal and painful manner.
Now I must conclude with a livelier piece of intelligence: I
am now in receipt of the wished-for invitation to visit the ALL-
miTi-lNNKTT family at the elegant mansion (or—to speak
Scottishly—" manse ") they have hired for a few weeks in the
savage and romantic mountains of Ayrshire, N.B.
Mrs. A. I. wrot« that there is no shooting attached to the
manse, but several aristocratic friends of theirs own moors in
the vicinity, and will inevitably invite them and their visitors to
sport with them, so that, as she believed I was the keen sporte-
man, I had better bring my gun.
Alack t I am not the happy possessor of any lethal weapon,
but, having since this invitation practised diligently upon tin
moving beasts, bottles, and eggs rendered incredibly lively by
a jeb of steam, I am at last an au fait with a crackshot, and no
end of a Nimrpd.
I do not think I shall purchase a gun, for there is a young
English acquaintance of mine who is the Devil's Own Volunteer,
and who wul no doubt have the good nature to lend me his rifle
for a week or two.
As to costume, my tailor assures me that it is totally un-
necessary to assume the national raiment of a Scotch, unless I
am prepared to stalk after a stag. But why should I be deterred
by any cowardly fear from pursuing so constitutionally timid a
quadruped? I have therefore commissioned him to manufacture
me a petticoat kilt, with a chequered tartan, and other acces-
sories, for when we are going to Rome, it is the mark of polite-
ness to dress in the Romish style.
The Caledonian costume is indubitably becoming; but would,
I venture humbly to think, be greatly improved by the simple
addition of some knee-caps.
EN ECOSSE.
À Monsieur Punch.
DEAR MISTER,—I come of to make a little voyage in Scotland.
Ah, the beautiful country of Sir SCOTT, Sir WALLACH, and Sir
BURNS I I am gone to render visit to one of my english friends,
a charming boy—un charmant garçon—and his wife, a lady very
instructed and very spiritual, and their childs. I adore them,
the dear little english childs, who have the cheeks like some
roses, and the hairs like some flax, as one says in your country,
all buckled—bouclés, how say you?
I go by the train of night—in french one says "le sleeping "—
to Edimbourg, and then to Calendar, where I attend to find a
coach—in french one says "un mail" or "un fourinhand."
Nom d'une pipe, it is one of those ridicule carriages, called in
french "un breach," and in english a char-à-banc—that which
the english pronounce "tcherribaingue "—which attends us at
the going out of the station! Eh well, in voyage one must
habituate himself to allí But a such carriage discovered—
découverte—seems to me well unuseful in a country where he
falls of rain without cease.
Before to start I demand of all the world some renseignements
on the Scottish climate, and all the world responds me, "All-
days of the rain." By consequence I procure myself some im-
permeable vestments, one mackintoech coat, one mackintosch
cape of Inverness, one mackintosch covering of voyage, one
south-western hat, some umbrellas, some gaiters, anal many
pairs of boots very thick—not boote of town, but veritable
"shootings."
I arrive at Edimbourg by a morning of the most sads; the sky
grey, the earth wet, the air humid. Therefore I propose to my-
self to search at Calendar a place at the interior, et voilà—

there at the middle of the baggages? Ah no! Thus I am forced
to endorse—endosser—my impermeable vestments and to protect
myself the head by my south-western hat. Then, holding firmly
the most strong of my umbrellas, I say to the coacher, "He goes
to fall of the rain, is it not?" He makes a sign of head of not
to comprehend. Ah, for sure, he is Scottish! I indicate the sky

OTHER
LI HUNG CHANG'S ONE JOKE.
THERE has been much written in the papers about two jokes
said to have been made by Li HUNO CHANG during his visit to
Newcastle. One was translated, the other was not. Those who
heard both think the one left untranslated was by far the
funnier. His Excellency, for his part, is reported to have ex-
ceedingly enjoyed both, laughing till his pig-tail almost came off.
"Two jokes? my dear TOBY," said his Excellency, when the
M.P. saw him olf at Southampton, bound for New York.
"There has been only one joke connected with my visit to your
country, but that has been a real good 'un. Several times it has
occurred to me when I have been in public. I have had to say
some unconsequential things, like those two remarks at New-
castle. Then Lo FENG LUH, who has a large mouth, laughs,
чш! says, 'His Excellency has made a joke.' You people look ¡ill
round for it, under the table, in corners of the room, up on the
ceiling, as if it were a fly, and I quietly enjoy my own laugh."
"And what, Sir, if I may put the question without giving
notice, is the joke?"
"The joke, my dear TOBY, is that all you outer baibariaus,
beginning at Berlin, going on to Paris, swarming round me in
this country, insist that I have come here to give big orders for
ronclads, for guns, for railways, even for sewing-machines. Т
France, and the rest looking in, wondering if I was going to
buy anything here. Ha! hn !—Who drew that? TENNIEL?
How old is TENNIEL? How much a year does he get?—Well,
when I am taken to your foundries and workshops, and ship-
building yards, with the expectation that I will forthwith buy
everything up, I nearly kill myself with trying not to laugh in
your face. That is why I sometimes go in a corner of a room
and for a few minutes turn my back on the company. That is
why Lo FENG LUH, who values his place and his head, whenever
he sees me beginning to go off, translates something to you and
says, 'His Excellency jokes.'
"Good-bye, TOBY. Excuse me running off, but I feel a fit
of laughter coming on. Don't forget to come and see us in
China. You're a nice dog. I'm so fond of you, I could eat
you. Ha! ha! Must tell that to Lo FENG LUH. It'll do for
one of 'His Excellency's jokes' when we get to the United
States, and they begin all over again with their big guns, their
ironclads, their railways, and their sewing-machines."

AnvF.HTiNKirKNT.—The ele-
gant auctioneering art of fanciful-descrip-
tive - advertisement - composition has not
yet departed from among us. The genius
of JOHN ROBINS still inspires the com-
pounders of these attractive mixtures. In
the Globe, and probably in many other
favoured papers, there recently appeared,
and no doubt frequently appears, a delight-
ful sample of this style in a small delicately-
printed paragraph, which you do not dis-
cover to be an Advt." until you come to
within three lines of its last word, com-
mencing, "All amateurs of elegant and
worldly holidays,"—where, at once, the eye
and the action of the brain are arrested
by the simple adjective "worldly." You
expect, after this, a sermon, a goody-goody
lecture, or at least some highly moral
advice. Not a bit of it. The paragraph
only announces the fact that Ostern! is a
by boat of Dover. Then it gives a kind of
Monte Cristo account of the Kursaal, of
the saloons, of the society, and it finishes
with this magnificent climax : —" AU lan-
guages are spoken as in Babd and Monte
Carlo. Attractions are also identical."
Now we know what went on in Babel.
The tour de force at Babel must have been
a breaking of the bank, and consequent
dispersion of the gamblers using all sorts
of language. Antiquarian research will
owe a great debt to the compilers of this
paragraph from which we have quoted,
and which is, after all, only an advertise-
ment for a certain Tea-grower in Ceylon.
THE DOOM ОГ DULWICH.
(By an old Dulwich Bay in Doleful Dumps.)
ALAS for the famous old inna I
Ah I progress is all very well,
But one of its shockingest sins
Is ringing antiquity's knell.
The "Crown" and the "Half Moon" are
gone,
And now they the " Greyhound" attack.
Ah me, for old frolic and fun
In the days that will never come back!
Old Dulwich is now merely dull,
Wit shines with a feebler and slacker
ray.
The "Greyhound" of memories is full
Of the brave days of DICKENS and
THACKERAY.
Now the fine old-world flavour is fled,
Old landmarks are gone and I 'in baffled;
New bricks are wherever I tread,
My feet stray in a forest of—scaffold.
The Dulwich I used to adore
Is now grown almost out of knowledge.
The fields I once roved are no more,
Next, no doubt, they will pull down the
College I
Fine gentlemen now could not meet
To settle disputes—by a duel.
They might as well try Regent's Street
To give one another their gruel.
A nice little party, for bowls,
Used to meet at that white-painted
wicket,
But now Jerry Builders, the ghouls,
Have robbed us of bowls, quoits, and
cricket.
I used here with a rusty old gun
To pop round those meadows—for
sparrows;
I used there with a well-beloved One
To shoot at a target with arrows.
But archery 's now obsolete,
A stroll in dear Dulwich now sickens;
A DICKENS no more may I meet,
Though Dulwich has gone to the

boy, how is he getting on at school?
Materfamilias. Well, he just manages
to keep clear of being superannuated,
which is very satisfactory.
F. of the F. (drily). Very. Not good
at Greek, eh?
M. Oh. he doesn't learn Greek. He's
on the Modern Side, you know. He only
blew himself up once last term—in the
laboratory. And he 'в made half of a
working model of a gas-engine, in his
engineering set, he tells us.
F. of the F. And his health?
M. Capital I He keeps himself always
in training, you know—we allow him an
and he has the biggest calves and thighs
of any boy of his age in the school.
F. of the F. (doubtfully). Calves and
thighs; but will that sort of thing be
much good to him in his future profession
—the Law, I think you said?
M. (calmly). We have given up all idea
of the Law for him.
F. of the F. Indeed! Perhaps he has
a good head for mathematics, and if so,
why should he not be a wrangler?
M. He can't understand the first book
of Euclid. But so long as he can add up
pounds, shillings, and pence, and plenty
of tliHin, that is all that will be required
of him in the profession which we have
selected for him.
F. of the F. (getting interested). Then
what is to be his path in life?
M. Why, the cycling racing path, of
course! He can follow the lead of his

sister. Listen to this: "One well-known
wheeler has earned £2,000 in prizes alone
during the past seven months, apart from
the heavy retainer which he receives from
the tyre and cycle manufacturers whose
properties he uses. A leading professional
cyclist has an income of from £1,600 to
£2,000 a year." Where is the Law com-
pared with t IM 11
F. of the F. Nowhere, of course. But
—er—would you call it exactly a lilii-ntl
profession?
If. (carelessly). Oh. I believe the track
proprietors are liberal enough—pay about
£70 to you if you win, and £50 if you lose.
Our boy says he "would much rather be
a wheel-driver than a quill-driver." So
we 're going to let him.
F. of the F. (trying to conquer old-
fashioned prejudices). Well, perhaps you
are wise. Hope he '11 avoid spills, that 's

own son (at the Bar) will ever

AT HOME АКБ ABROAD IN LESS THAN A JIFFEY.
(By Our Travelling impressionist.)
EARLY to bed and early to rise. Breakfast at eight, in one's
own dear home (never dearer than when the rates are five
and sixpence in the pound!), and then away to the Victoria
terminus of the L. C. and D. R. At nine, sharp, starts the
capital express for Dover, reaching the favourite Cinque-port
shortly before eleven. From the comfortable carriage to the
luxurious boat, and the coast of France is reached as A.M.
changes to P.M. Then, after a practical recognition of the
culinary attractions of the admirable buffet of the Hotel Ter-
minus, away to the market-place, and (with the assistance of a
carl to the sea-shore. The plage is reached—Calais Plage!
And now you are in front of the sea. The sands are free from
niggers, brass bands, and other irritating distractions. Ex-
tending for about half a mile is a row of email apartments.
Each apartment has folding doors, which can be closed and
locked. And now I am particularly attracted by an apart-
ment which has an awning in front of the entrance, decorated
with two small tricolour flaps. In my mind I christen this
war-like looking apartment "The Citadel." In front of it are
the regulation two little girls digging the customary hole.
A gentleman of middle age—say about sixty—emerges from
the Citadel, carrying in his hand a small Japanese kite. He
looks towards the sea, and then prepares to fly the paper repre-
sentation of the strange bird he clutches. He seizes his oppor-
tunity and throws the kite in the air. The ascent is not a
success. The strange bird plunges one way, then another, and
finally descends. The gentleman of middle age seeks advice.
He addresses someone in the Citadel. His appeal is responded
to by a French military officer in full uniform! The General
(he can scarcely be less than a General) has his kepi, his tunic,
his spurs, and his legion d'honneur! However, he shows that
he is not on duty by wearing his tunic unbuttoned at the waist,
and smoking. He is enjoying a long German pipe. The General
gravely regards the wind, and offers a suggestion. The gentle-
acquiescence and lengthens the tail of the kite. Ah, the good
hour I The kite rises and rests steadily, supported by the breeze.
Then the string is pegged into the sand, and the relatives supply
themselves with long-handled spades and begin digging.
But what is this? Why, a lady passing along has become
entangled in the string of the kite. Thus disturbed, the
strange bird (known better in Japan than in Europe) has
suddenly descended. The lady offers to the General and his
brother a thousand apologies. The amende is courteously but
gravely accepted. The warrior brings himself sharply to "atten-
tion" as he gives a military salute. The kite rises once more,
and the peg is restored to its sandy bed. Then there is a con-
sultation—a council of war—to decide how in future the peg
shall be protected. The General hits upon an idea. He fetches
from the Citadel a small French flag. He places the banner of
his country next the peg. From that moment the kite is under
the protection of the drapeau of la belle France!
Having succoured the kite, the General and his brother
return to their digging. Now comes a cessation of work to watch
a veritable sportsman walking along the sands in search of prey.
The veritable sportsman carries a real gun and a real game bag.
The latter looks as if it had been bought at a toy-shop. On either
side of the veritable sportsman march a boy and a priest. The
boy no doubt will, when the important moment is reached, let
off the gun. And if there is an accident the services of the
chaplain will be accepted with gratitude.
Those who have not apartments on the sea-shore have now
noticed that the shadows are becoming longer. En. route!
Back by the car "in the service of the administration" to the
market-place. From thence to the good steamer of the L. C.
and D. R. is but a few minutes' walk. The Paris train arrives,
the bell rings, and the excellent vessel backs out of the harbour.
En route! We are at Dover I En route! We have reached
Victoria. And then in less than a jiffey we are seated at dinner.
And while we are eating in London the happy families of Calais
Plage are no doubt locking up their day apartments before the
sea and preparing to occupy the neighbouring chalets. May
man of middle age (I take him to be the warrior's brother) bows
their night dreams be as pleasant as the day reality!

shortly before eleven. From the comfortable carriage to the
luxurious boat, and the coast of France is reached as A.M.
changes to P.M. Then, after a practical recognition of the
culinary attractions of the admirable buffet of the Hotel Ter-
minus, away to the market-place, and (with the assistance of a
car} to the sea-shore. The plage is reached—Calais Plage!
And now you are in front of the sea. The sands are free from
niggers, brass bands, and other irritating distractions. Ex-
tending for about half a mile is a row of small apartments.
Each apartment has folding doors, which can be closed and
locked. And now I am particularly attracted by an apart-
ment which has an awning in front of the entrance, decorated
with two small tricolour flaps. In my mind I christen this
war-like looking apartment "The Citadel." In front of it are
the regulation two little girls digging the customary hole.
A gentleman of middle age—say about sixty—emerges from
the Citadel, carrying in his hand a small Japanese kite. He
looks towards the sea, and then prepares to fly the paper repre-
sentation of the strange bird he clutches. He seizes his oppor-
tunity and throws the kite in the air. The ascent is net a
success. The stranee bird plunges one way, then another, and
finally descends. The gentleman of middle age seeks advice.
He addresses someone in the Citadel. His appeal is responded
to by a French military officer in full uniform! The General
(he can scarcely be less than a General) has his kepi, his tunic,
his spurs, and his kgion d'honneur! However, he shows that
he is not on duty by wearing his tunic unbuttoned at the waist,
and smoking. He is enjoying a long German pipe. The General
gravely regards the wind, and offers a suggestion. The gentle-
acquiescence and lengthens the tail of the kite. Ah, the good
hour! The kite rises and rests steadily, supported by the breeze.
Then the string is pegged into the sand, and the relatives supply
themselves with long-handled spades and begin digging.
But what is this? Why, a lady passing along has become
entangled in the string of the kite. Thus disturbed, the
strange bird (known better in Japan than in Europe) has
suddenly descended. The lady offers to the General and his
brother a thousand apologies. The amende is courteously but
gravely accepted. The warrior brings himself sharply to "atten-
tion" as he gives a military salute. The kite rises once more,
and the peg is restored to its sandy bed. Then there is a con-
sultation—a council of war—to decide how in future the peg
shall be protected. The General hits upon an idea. He fetchos
from the Citadel a small French flag. He places the banner of
his country next the peg. From that moment the kite is under
the protection of the drapeau of la belle France!
Having succoured the kite, the General and his brother
return to their digging. Now comes a cessation of work to watch
a veritable sportsman walking along the sands in search of prey.
The veritable sportsman carries a real gun and a real game bag.
The latter looks as if it had been bought at a toy-shop. On either
side of the veritable sportsman march a boy and a priest. The
boy no doubt will, when the important moment is reached, let
off the gun. And if there is an accident, the services of the
chaplain will be accepted with gratitude.
Those who have not apartments on the sea-shore have now
noticed that the shadows are becoming longer. En route!
Back by the car "in the service of the administration" to the
market-place. From thence to the good steamer of the L. C.
and D. R. ia but a few minutes' walk. The Paris train arrives,
the bell rings, and the excellent vessel backs out of the harbour.
En route! We are at Dover! En route! We have reached
Victoria. And then in less than a jiffey we are seated at dinner.
And while we are eating in London the happy families of Calais
Plage are no doubt locking up their day apartments before the
sea and preparing to occupy the neighbouring chalet». May
man of middle age (I take him to be the warrior's brother) bows
their night dreams be as pleasant as the day reality!

CHAPTER П.—"Experto crcde."
Тнв Duchess was about to speak, when a respectful knock
sounded on the door, and in response to the Duke's loud "Come
in," an aged man in the threadbare uniform of a major-domo
entered, and, bowing low, whispered in tremulous accents: —
"Mr. MAGLAZABUS, your Grace, is here. He says, by ap-
pointment."
"Quite right, PLANTAGENET," said the Duke. "Show him in.
Stay, turn on that other light."
"The pictures must go, then," sighed the Duchess. "Can't
you"
"They must, madam," broke in the Duke, sternly. "Let us
have no scene over the matter. Let this money-grabber see
that a VANPERKBN can swallow misfortune as easily as a little
neck clam."
The Duchess gave a little shiver, but managed to raise up a
watery smile when Mr. М.м 1,л/.лкгя was announced. He was
a well-dressed gentleman of perhaps forty, slim and fair, wit!
no trace of opulence in his appearance, except in the matter of
his waistcoat buttons, each one of which was a single black
pearl of great size. His manners were most finished, and on
the Duchess putting forth her hand, he raised it to his lips
with infinite respect, but forbore to touch the delicate white
skin.
"Your Grace sees," he observed, drawing a nickel Water-
bury watch from his pocket, "that I am, as usual, punctual."
"Just so," said the Duke, without attempting to produce a
timekeeper. "What 's the news?"
"There's a considerable fall in stocks," replied Mr. MAC-
LAZARUS. "It is, however, expected that Mexicans will re-
cover and-"
"Pooh!" interrupted the Duke, rather rudely, "I wasn't
referring to your world, but to mine. How are vx getting on?"
Mr. MACLAZARUS paused before replying to the ducal query.
Then he said cautiously, with a compassionate smile, "tíadly,
your Grace, very badly. The Earl of POTOMAC is going through
the Court, Lord MASSACHUSETTS is selling his estates, Sir RIP
VAN WINKLE has lost a fortune over the Duke of Niagara
"How dreadful!" cried the Duchess. "And is it true that
Lady CHICAGO has eloped with Mr. WEINSCHNITZBL the brewer?"
"Unfortunately, it is," replied Mr. MACLAZARUS. "The news
has caused a great sensation at Court. The Empress is furious,
and the Princess of TAMMANY has removed Lady SYBIL SPLODGE
—Lady CHICAGO'S sister—from the number of her Maids of
Honour."
"Poor girl I" said the Duchess; "she is not to blame."
"Nonsense I" snorted the Duke; "she 'd have married
WEINSCHNITZBL herself if she'd only had half a chance. But
let 's to business, MACLAZARUS, for I guess you 've other fixings
to look after."
"I have, your Grace," said the financier, suavely; "but at
present I am at your commands. Let me see," he added, re-
ferring to a notebook, "you desjre to dispose of your collection
of pictures, including the Whistler, the Marcus Stone, and
two so-called Turners"
"How do you mean—the so-called Turners P" broke in the
Duke, angrily.
"I regret to say," said Mr. MACLAZARUS, calmly. "that the
Turners, the Muíais, the Leighton, the three Herkomers, the
Dicksee, and four out of the five Leaders, are undoubtedly
copies."
Copies!" echoed the Duke, hotly. "Do you mean to tell
me that I am proposing to sell you a parcel of shams? You 'd
scarcely have ventured to say as much to my grandfather, the
first Duke, who lived in the good old days of smart shooting.
[ suppose he was fooled when he laid out over a million on this
collection?"
"I regret to say he was," answered Mr. MACLAZARUS, with
the greatest possible sang frotd. "But I beg your Grace to
understand that I do not say all the pictures are forgeries."
"Forgeries 1" shouted the peer, rising from his seat and
breaking his pipe violently on the table. "ForgeriesI How
dare you use such a word to me P"
And he advanced, boiling with rage, towards the imper-
lurbable dealer. The affrighted Duchess flung herself upon her
.usband's neck, crying, "ОI JONATHAN, JONATHAN, calm

(To be continued.)
AT CODDLETON-ON-SEA.
[The Brituh Medical Journal warns parents against allowing their
children to paddle in the sea.]
THE attention of parente cannot be too seriously drawn to
>ther dangers of the sea-side. Take crabs, for instance, though
л-е don't advise the average parent to take a crab unless he is
ised to them. A little boy that we know of was bitten by a
^rab on the sands, and the effect of the bite, possibly aided by
•i fall of twenty feet from the pier on to some rocks, produced
1 ram fever! The only safe plan is, not to let children go near
the sands.
Bathing on a shingly beach is most dangerovs. We have heard
of instances where children have cut their feet on the sharp
>ebbles, which might have ended in blood poisoning and laming
for life, had not the blood been in an exceptionally pure con-
dition. Such cases should act as warnings. Never think" of
jp.thing tt'H all the nhingle has been cleared away!
Donkey-riding at the sea-side is also very deleterious. A lad
of eight, who fell from a donkey, has been so mentally injured
that he seems incapable of doing simple addition sums, though
when at school he could do compound subtraction. It is true
that his mother ascribes the circumstance to the fact that
"JOHNNY never will do sums in holidays," but we prefer to
believe that a brain-lesion hns occurred, which must be serious
and may be permanent—always supposing that JOHNNY has any
brain to be lesed, which, considering his mother's inaccessibility
to medical advice, is doubtful.
It is hardly necessary to add that the prudent parent will
rigorously discourage such dangerous weapons as spades,
buckets, and toy boats. A spade skilfully used can amputate
a toe, the mainmast of a boat may put put an eye, and a baby,
after considerable practice, might contrive to drown itself in its
own bucket. Don't let children have any good games, either.
Games make them hot and feverish. Coddling, and coddle-
liver oil, and plenty of both, may make your children somewhat
fretful, and a little unbearable in smnll lodgings, but it will
preserve them from some of the awful perils sketched above.

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
STRAY NOTES ON WOMEN.
I wojfDKB that no philosopher has yet written a monograph on the
meals of women. It is an important and a fascinating subject—
important in it« relation to food, fascinating in its relation to
the female appetite. To any investigator who shall feel tempted
to undertake it, I beg to offer the following notes as a sort of
mémoires pour servir, the rough blocks, as it were, which he may
afterwards hew into shape for the purpose of his edifice.
I TAKE it that ever since EVE eat the unpermitted apple
between times, women have in every age displayed a liking for
odd meals at odd hours. If by dint of scheming and good luck,
a modern housewife has been able to get rid of the males of the
household, her first impulse is to heave a sigh of relief at the
blessed thought that there need be no dinners. She will take
unto herself a female friend, and somewhere between six and
seven o'clock in the evening, a tray will be brought in to them
and will be placed, not on a solid dining-room t«ble, but (and
this is essential) on a rickety little side-table. The tray groans
under a varied assortment of mixed eatables. There are sand-
wiches, butter, a cake, a fragmentary aspic from yesterday's
dinner, two meringues and a half, some ginger-bread biscuite,
a dish of strawberry-jam, three poached eggs, some chocolate
creams, muffins, dry toast, and a saucer of mixed pioklee. So
much for the solid part. The liquid is composed of tea, cold
water and cream, the last being generally taken separate. It
would seem, in the nature of things, impossible that one fragile
tray should bear all this load; but it does. Indeed, half the
pleasure of the meal is that it. should come in all at once on a
single tray, and that its disjected members should later on be
gathered together from the four quarters of the room, replaced
on the tray, and whisked away into oblivion at one fell swoop.
AND oh, with what a sense of comfortable abandon do the two
feasters revel in this innocent orgie. There is no hateful
formality, no impassive butler stands behind to chill the fervour
of conversation, there are no dismal pauses, no taunts from rude
men as to the quality of the food or the capacity of the cook.
Everything is spread out in full view; you can have a spoonful
here, a handful there; you can start with a chocolate cream,
follow on with a poached egg and a slice of cake, and wind up
with a meringue and a muffin. Glorious meal, and wondrous
feminine digestion, to which nothing comes amiss 1 Men, in com-
parison, are the merest slaves of a cut and dried routine—apt to
be thrown out of gear by the slightest departure from their
wretched dietetic ordinances. Give me rather the free and un-
trammelled meals of a woman when she has been left to herself.
THE average woman, too, is a confirmed supper-eater. Supper
is an irregular meal, and women are, therefore, devoted to
suppers. Without tíie substantial support of women all the
great supper-providing establishments of the metropolis would
have been in the Bankruptcy Court long ago. At balls, after
theatre« and concerte, at home, or in restaurants—wherever
the supper is there will the women be gathered together.
Lobster, dressed crab, mayonnaise of salmon or chicken, soup in
cups, cold cutlets, ortolans, all disappear as if by magic if only
you call the meal supper and provide a reasonable number of
lady-guests. If you called it dinner, and fixed it for a decently-
digestive hour, the noblest efforts of the chef would be sent away
untasted, or at most, picked at and dallied with.
AND so we come to picnics and afternoon tea. Now, with
regard to afternoon tea, the discussion is a delicate one, for I
understand that the great increase in the import of tea during
recent years is due to the fact that man, proud man, who
formerly used to drink a brandy and soda when he came home
from work or play, now pute away his two cups of tea regularly.
I am told, that if you offer a man spirits on his return from shoot-
ing, he will scout the suggestion and declare that tea is his
drink. This may be so, and for the present, therefore, I pass by
afternoon tea. But in the matter of picnics our withers are un-
wrung. Is there a man worthy of the name who dares to affirm
that he likes a picnic? Who .is it that proposes a picnic?
Is it a man? Never. Picnics are merely another method
of escape from regularity and comfort in meals, and it is to
women that they owe such vogue as they have ever ob-
tained. Who but a woman could ever have had a suffi-
ciently vivid imagination to believe that there was pleasure in
dumping your food down amidst stones and wasps and patches
of grass, devouring it in ridiculous positions, and leaving a litter
of paper to destroy the landscape? But it is a curious fact that
there is about most organised picnics a ceremonious formality,
which is rarely observable at meals served in the humdrum
fashion on a table set on a floor under a ceiling and within four
walls.
Hands and Hearts.
"HANDS off, in South Africa !"—so says our JOB,
Is our watchword in Afric, our Doctrine MONKOB.
The Dutchman, remembering some things that are gone,
Might hint that our watchword was lately "Hands on!"
May be, tie best watchword at last will be found,
That of TENNYSON'S patriot song, "Hands au Round!"
In which be expressed better patriot pride
Than did his successor in "JAMESON'S Ride."

PRINCE RANJIT he marched to the westward, from the borders
of Bombay he came,
To the banks of the Cam, and he collared the crown of the

The game which the GRACES and STODDARTB, the flannel-clad
ones of the West,
Declared of all masculine pastimes the proudest and noblest and
best,

In the Raj-Kumar school in the East, or in Trinity College,
by Cam,
Upon cocoa-nut matting at .home, or green turf at the Oval or
Lords,
"RANJI" shaped like a cricketer sound, and there 's scarcely a
sight which affords
More pleasure to judges of "form" than the sight of the slim,
swarthy Prince,
In, batting as neat as a trivet, in fielding as sharp aa a quince,
Giving beans to the best British bowling, or stopping or sprinting
like steam,
Or making that lovely late cut, a serene thing of beauty, a dream
Of delight, an ideal of art, with the charm of a perfect technique.
Which a fellow who knows what is what at the wicket«, could
watch for a week!
The public soon knew "Mr. SMITH," and they yelled every time
he appeared,
And they gave him the nick-names crowds give to the cracks to
"Ramsgate JIMMY," or "Rum-Gin-and-Whiskey "—more pat
than polite, to a Prince,
But the cricketing crowd by familiar facetiousness loves to evince
It« rough but sincere hero-worship, as he the great Doctor doth
know,
\Vhom they love to acclaim as "the Old "un," and chaff when he
bends for a "blow"
After running a fiver—near fifty! But RANJIT the Run-Getter
soon
Began piling "centuries" quickly to a most remarkable tune,
And having a cut at all records. Some toppers that way he 's
rubbed out.
He 's a-top of the Average« now, and he means getting higher,
no doubt—
If that's not a bull—Sussex' hope, and the pride of the Cam he
appears,
And when the Light Blues give that banquet, your lovers of big
British cheers
Will have every tympanum tickled by shouts for the "Black
Bat/'—not night,
As TENNYSON put it in Maud, and SIMS REEVES to a nation's
delight,
Hath flutily piped it so often. And faith! the "Black Bat"
hath not flown,
And all Britons hope well he won't do, for we love to think
"RANJI" our own.
An ode to him, then, unto whom we, this season, have owed such
a lotl
And when British bate fight for those "ashes," and there are
some signs of a "rot,
When we want someone brilliant and steady, hawk-eyed, lion-
hearted, and cool,
A blend of MACLAREN and GRACE, with the "stick" of the
SHREWSBURY school,
The sparkle of STODDART or WYNYARD, the patience of Surrey's
brave BOB,
May RANJIT the Black Prince of cricket, be with us, and "well
on the job " !! J
THE TRAVELLING 'AERY.
(From a Cynical Point of View. )
HE leaves, on setting foot on the Continent, his normal tolera-
tion of the foreigner, and regards everyone and everything with
undisguised contempt.
He declares that St. Peter's is inferior to St. Paul's, the
British Museum superior to the Louvre, and Notre Dame not
i patch on Westminster Abbey.
He appears to be recalling Waterloo every time he comes
across a French soldier.
He never touches his hat to anyone, and drops "Monsieur"
>nd "Madame " in spite of the custom of the country.
He appears on the boulevards in a pot hat, and ignores evening
dress in places where grande, tenue is de rigueur.
He laughs contemptuously at all he fails to understand, and
lever takes the trouble to comprehend anything.
He assumes that no one but an Englishman can drive, row,
«hoot, or engage in athletics.
If he travels in France he becomes aristocratic, and socialistic
if he wanders in Germany.
He sees nothing in Venice, Florence, Dresden, or Berlin.
He yawns in the Vatican, and goes to sleep in the Paris Opera
House.
He walks about everywhere as if the whole place belonged to
him, and resents as an intrusion the presence of the original
inhabitants.
He speaks his own tongue and no other, and expects everyone
to understand him.
He bullies the waiters, and regards the hotel-keepers as
brigands.
He never enters a shop without assuming that the persons
behind the counter are banded to rob him.
He expects everyone to bow before him, and to make way foi
him.
He is bumptious and obstinate and stupid and inconsiderate,
and then,'after disporting himself as an overbearing bounder
everywhere in foreign parte, he learns with surprise, on his
return to his native land, that the Briton is the reverse of
popular abroad.

DEAB MISTER,—I have spoken you of my departure from
Calendar on the breach. En, well, he rained not of the whole
of the whole—du tout du tout! Il faisait un temps superbe
—he was making a superb time, the route was well agree-
able, and the voyage lasted but two hours, and not twelve.
What droll of ideal In Scottish twa is two, not twelve. I was
so content to arrive so quick and without to be wetted that I
gave the coacher a good to-drink—un bon pourboire—though
before to start all the voyagers had paid him a "tipp," that
which he called a "driver's fee." Again what droll of ideal To
gi/e the to-drink before to start, and each one the same—six
pennys.
My friend encountered me and conducted me to his house,
where I have passed fifteen days, a sojourn of the most agréables.
And all the time almost not one sole drop of rain I .l'uni is
beau—I had fine—to buy all my impermeable vestments, I carry
them never. One sole umbrella suffices me, and I open him
but two times. And yet one says that the Scotland is a rainy
country. It is perhaps a season tout à fait—all to fact—excep-
tional. But fifteen days almost without ruin! One would
believe himself at the border of the Mediterranean, absolutely
at the South.
And I have eaten of the "porridg," me AUGUSTE! Partout
I essay the dish of the .country. I take at first a spoonful pure
and simple. Oh, la, la! My friend offers me of the cream. It
is well. Also of the salt. Queue idée! But no, before me I
perceive a dish of confiture, that which the Scottish call "mar-
maladde." A la bonne heure! With some marmaladde, some
cream, and much of sugar, I find that the "porridg" is enough
well, for I taste him no more.
One day we make an ascension, and we see many grouses.
Only we can not to shoot, for it is not yet the season of the
huntings. It is but a hill that we mount. The name appears
me to be french, but bad written. "Ben Venue," that is to
say, "Bienvenu"—soyez le bienvenu. She is one of the first of
pretty idea, and a politeness very amiable towards my country.
I salute the hospitable Scotland and I thank her. It is a great
country, of brave men, of charming women—ah, I recal| to my-
self some eyes so beautiful, some forms so attracting!—of
ravishing landscapes, and, at that epoch there, of a climate so
delicious. She has one sole and one great defect. The best
Scottish hotels cost very dear, and, my faith, the two or three
that I visited are not great thing like comfortable—ne sont pat
grand'chose comme comfortable!
One day we make a little excursion on the Lake of Lomond.
The lake is well beautiful, and the steamboat is excellent. But
in oijn certain hotel, in descending from a breach, and before to
embark, we take the "lunch." We bargain not, we ask not
even the price, we eat at the table d'hôte like all the world in
Swiss, in France, even in Germany, when there is but one half
hour before the departure of the train or of the boat. Oh la, la!
I have eaten in the Spanish hotels, on the steamboats of the
Italian lakes, even in the restaurants—mon Dieu !—of the english
railways, but never, never—-au grand jamais—have I eaten a
déjeuner like that I One dish I shall forget never; some ex-
terior green leaves of lettuce, without oil or vinegar, which they
called a "salad." Parbleu—by blue! In all the history of the
world there hae been but one man who would have could to eat
her with pleasure—NABUCHODONOSOR I Agree, «fee., AUGUSTE.
"Gentlemen v. Players."
THIS title, given to a popular enough cricket match, may sound
a little "invidious" to the democratic spirit of to-day, more so,
pc r haps, than in the times of "Mr." MYNN and FULLEE PILCH.
"Amateurs v. Professionals" would perhaps do equally well,
and create less heart-burning in certain quarters. Mr. C. B.
FRY, that admirable all-round athlete, says that "The so-called
sham amateurism exists entirely in the imagination of the few
discontented professionals, and in the mischief-making columns
of certain négligeable journals." Mr. Punch trusta this is so,
and Mr. FRY ought to know. Mr. Punch is inclined to believe
that the "real enemies" of the glorious old game are the
"Gentlemen" who are not (fair) players, and the " Players" who
the Scottish hills, and she says "welcome" in french. It is n

(From a Cynical Point of View.)
HE leaves, on setting foot on the Continent, his normal tolera-
tion of the foreigner, and regards everyone and everything with
undisguised contempt.
He declares that St. Peter's is inferior to St. Paul's, the
British Museum superior to the Louvre, and Notre Dame not
л patch on Westminster Abbey.
He appears to be recalling Waterloo every time he comes
¿icross a French soldier.
He never touches his hat to anyone, and drops "Monsieur"
>nd "Madame " in spite of the custom of the country.
He appears on the boulevards in a pot hat, and ignores evening
dress in places where grande, tenue is de rigueur.
He laughs contemptuously at all he fails to understand, and
lever takes the trouble to comprehend anything.
He assumes that no one but an Englishman can drive, row,
<hoot, or engage in athletics.
If he travels in France he becomes aristocratic, and socialistic
if he wanders in Germany.
He sees nothing in Venice, Florence, Dresden, or Berlin.
He yawns in the Vatican, and goes to sleep in the Paris Opera
House.
He walks about everywhere as if the whole place belonged to
him, and resents as an intrusion the presence of the original
inhabitants.
He speaks his own tongue and no other, and expects everyone
to understand him.
He bullies the waiters, and regards the hotel-keepers as
brigands.
He never enters a shop without assuming that the persons
behind the counter are banded to rob him.
He expects everyone to bow before him, and to make way foi
him.
He is bumptious and obstinate and stupid and inconsiderate,
and then," after disporting himself as an overbearing bounder
everywhere in foreign parts, he learns with surprise, on his
return to his native land, that the Briton is the reverse of
popular abroad.

DEAR MISTER,—I have spoken you of my departure from
Calendar on the breach. En, well, he rained not of the whole
of the whole—du tout du tout! Il faisait un temps superbe
—he was making a superb time, the route was well agree-
able, and the voyage lasted but two hours, and not twelve.
\\ hut droll of ideal In Scottish iwa is two, not twelve. I was
so content to arrive so quick and without to be wetted that I
gave the coacher a good to-drink—un bon pourboire—though
before to start all the voyagers had paid him a "tipp," that
which he called a "driver's fee." Again what droll of idea! To
gire the to-drink before to start, and each one the same—six
pennys.
My friend encountered me and conducted me to his house,
where I have passed fifteen days, a sojourn of the most agréables.
And all the time almost not one sole drop of rain 1 J'avais
beau—I had fine—to buy all my impermeable vestments, I carry
them never. One sole umbrella suffices me, and I open him
but two times. And yet one says that the Scotland is a rainy
country. It is perhaps a season tout à fait—all to fact—excep-
tional. But fifteen days almost without rain! One would
believe himself at the border of the Mediterranean, absolutely
at the South.
And I have eaten of the "porridg," me AUGUSTE! Partout
I essay the dish of the .country. I take at first a spoonful pure
and simple. Oh la, la! My friend offers me of the cream. It
is well. Also of the salt. Quelle idée! But no, before me I
perceive a dish of confiture, that which the Scottish call "mar-
maladde." A la bonne heure! With some marmaladde, some
cream, and much of sugar, I find that the "porridg" is enough
well, for I taste him no more.
One day we make an ascension, and we see many grouses.
Only we can not to shoot, for it is not yet the season of the
huntings. It is but a hill that we mount. The name appears
me to be french, but bad written. "Ben Venue," that is to
say, "Bienvenu "—soye,- le bienvenu. She is one of the first of
pretty idea, and a politeness very amiable towards my country.
[ salute the hospitable Scotland and I thank her. It is a great
country, of brave men, of charming women—ah, I recalj to my-
self some eyes so beautiful, some forms so attracting !—of
ravishing landscapes, and, at that epoch there, of a climate so
delicious. She has one sole and one great defect. The best
Scottish hotels cost very dear, and, my faith, the two or three
that I visited are not great thing like comfortable—ne sont pas
grand'chose comme comfortable!
One day we make a little excursion on the Lake of Lomond.
The lake is well beautiful, and the steamboat is excellent. But
in one certain hotel, in descending from a breach, and before to
embark, we take the "lunch." We bargain not, we aek not
even the price, we eat at the tabie d'hôte like all the world in
Swiss, in France, even in Germany, when there is but one half
hour before the departure of the train or of the boat, oh la, la!
I have eaten in the Spanish hotels, on the steamboats of the
italian lakes, even in the restaurants—mon Dieu !—of the english
railways, but never, never—-ou orand jamais—have I eaten a
déjeuner like that! One dish I shall forget never; some ex-
terior green leaves of lettuce, without oil or vinegar, which they
called a "salad." Parbleu—by blue! In all the history of the
world there hae been but one man who would have could to eat
her with pleasure—NABUCHODONOSOR! Agree, «fee., AUGUSTE.
"Gentlemen v. Players."
THIS title, given to a popular enough cricket match, may sound
a little "invidious" to the democratic spirit of to-day, more so,
perhaps, than in the times of " Mr." MTNN and FULLER PILCH.
"Amateurs v. Professionals" would perhaps do equally well,
and create less heart-burning in certain quarters. Mr. С. В.
FRY, that admirable all-round athlete, says that "The so-called
sham amateurism exists entirely in the imagination of the few
discontented professionals, and in the mischief-making columns
of certain négligeable journals." Mr. Punch trusts this is so,
and Mr. FRY ought to know. Mr. Punch ¡я inclined to believe
that the "real enemies" of the glorious old game are the
"Gentlemen" who are not (fair) players, and the " Players" who

Epsom Chambers, W., September 2, 1896.
SIR,—I have just been to the National Portrait Gallery, and
am truly shocked to find that most of our bygone patriots are
not represented. Where, for instance, is the inventor of the
chimney-pot hat? Why do we not look upon the features of
the Worcestershire nobleman, who first compounded the im-
mortal sauce? To whose professional jealousy may I ascribe
the absence of the lineaments of that philanthropist, who first
brought out flaming fusees? Is Captain WHITE, of mixed
pickle fame, not worthy of a place in the National Collection?
Where is the subtle chemist, who originated soda-water, or that
other, who perceived how happily the sparkling beverage blended
with brandy and whiskey? Where is the deviser of the elastic
brace, and where the gifted being who brought the Welsh rarebit
and its brother, the "buck," into existence? Where—but there,
Sir, my patience is exhausted, and so no doubt is your space.

tinuity of their famous inventions. I am, Sir, your obedient

DKAK SIR,—Surely in the National Portrait Gallery there
ought to be found some of those exquisite types of female love-
liness which delighted an older generation? I have inherited

trated with the most ravishing representations of fair dames and

(A Forecast.)
CHAITEK III.—" Noblesse oblige!"
So the tableau was formed; the Duke trembling with anger,
the Duchess with fear, and Mr. МЛГ),АУ.АКГ,Ч impassively de-
fiant, when the door was flung open and PLANTAGENET entered,
bearing a missive on a japanned tray.
"Pardon me, your Grace," he panted, "but it's a cablegram
—no doubt from England."
"Leave the room, Sir," thundered the Duke; and the major-
domo, after making a low obeisance, slunk from the apartment.
Despite his wrath, the Duke was a gentleman.
"Excuse me," he said to Mr. MACLAZARUS, before opening
the envelope. The dealer bowed, and watched the Duke as he
read the inclosure. His Grace's eyes sparkled behind his pince-
nez, his form grew more erect, and all trace of indignation
vanished from his countenance. Without a word he handed the
paper to the Duchess. On her, too, the message had evidently
a pleasant effect, for a happy expression came over her face,
and soft tears, evidently not caused by grief, made little canals
amid the cosmetics on her cheeks.
"Thank Heaven!" she murmured, while Mr. MACLAZARUS
wondered what the scene might mean. He had not long to
wait for an explanation.
"Mr. .Млс1,лхл11гм," said the Duke, in his grandest style, "I
shall not sell my pictures, forgeries or otherwise."
"As your Grace pleases," acquiesced the financier.
"Your time is money," continued the Duke, "therefore
charge me for the same."
Mr. МлиЬл/лкгн bowed, inwardly resolving that the noble-
man must certainly be distraught.
"This despatch," the Duke went on, "is from my son, the
Marquis of MANHATTAN; you may as well know its contents."
Then in a voice swelling with triumphant emotion, he read: —
"To the Duke of SARATOQA, Milwaukee House, New York.—
Am engaged SEIUNOA BROWN-SMITH, wealthiest heiress in Great
Britain. Beautiful and charming lady aged twenty-three. Have
explained our position. She agrees to settle one million pounds
sterling on you for lifo, and two millions without conditions on
myself. Total fortune, twelve millions. Expect you and
mother attend wedding fixed for New Year's Day St. Paul's
Cathedral. PRESIDENT gives away bride. Best love. Boom
intelligence. MANHATTAN."
"There, Sir, what do you think of that?" added the Duke,
with a beaming smile.
"Je-hoshaphat!" was all that Mr. MACLAZARUS could ejacu-
late. Then recollecting himself, he said, "I sincerely congratu-
late your Graces."
"Many thanks, my dear Sir," said the Duke, well pleased
with the effects which he had made. "You may communicate
the information to the Press if you please, but be particular
that the sums named are in pounds sterling, not dollars. Let
the world know that the Duke of SARATOGA can accept as well
as bestow."
"That 's true," said Mr. MACLAZARUS to himself, as he thought
of the many ducal bills which had passed through his hands.
"Ah! your Grace," he cried, with no feigned enthusiasm;
"this is, indeed, a great day for America!"
"It is," said the Duke, simply. "And now, Mr. MAC-
LAZARUS, I pray you, leave us, for the Duchess and myself
must instantly cable our blessing and good wishes to the hope
of our house and his bride elect."
As Mr. MACLAZARUS leapt into his luxuriously-appointed
motor-car, he said, with a quiet chuckle, "So the pendulum
is swinging back at last from the other side. I must look out
for a British heiress myself. I guess there '11 be no infringe-
ment of the MONROE Doctrine in this new invasion of the United
States."

Then in a voice swelling with triumphant emotion, he read: —

THE Member of an Ordinary London
Club arrived at the pleasant country
place to which he had been invited.
"Five o'clock tea going on?" he asked,
aa he divested himself of his travelling
wraps.
"Well, no, Sir. You see, the young
ladies — in fact, all the ladies — are cy-
cling, and won't be back until the hour
for dressing. But I daresay I can get
you a cup if you want one."
Slightly depressed, the Member leisurely
assumed the regulation dress suit for din-
ner, and made his way to the library.
No one was there, but there was plenty of
literature. The periodicals dealt, it is
true, only with wheeling, but there were
many of them. The books were locked
up in their dust-covered shelves. How-
ever, there were a few volumes lying open.
They were exclusively devoted to biking,
in all its branches.
The time passed slowly, then came a
rush of tyres, and the house party had
returned to head-quarters.
In due course the hosts and visitors as-
stmbled. The Member received a hearty
greeting.
"Ah, my dear fellow," cried the squire,
cheerily, "you should have come down
this morning. Such a splendid run!
Went sixty miles without sustaining a
puncture!"
The Member was at sea, and said so.
Then the Squire discoursed upon the ad-
vantages and disadvantages of various
makers. One was lighter than the other,
and the third was easier to keep in order
than the fourth, and so on.
The Member — in his own circle con-
sidered "an amusing rattle "—found him-
self nowhere. He was out of it, com-
pletely out of it. The ladies vanished
after dinner, and the men were left to
their coffee, liqueurs, and cigarettes.
"Next Session there may be a question
about the leadership," began the Member.
"Not at all," replied his host. "We
are not likely to see the record broken
yet awhile. But to return to to-day's run.
I do not remember anything to equal it."
And they talked cycling until it was
time to join the ladies. They kept up the
subject until the appearance of the tray
and glasses. They continued it in the
smoking-room, in négligé jackets and
slippers.
The Member had nought to say. And
if he had had there would have been no
one to listen to him. They talked cycling,
and nothing but cycling, until the early
hours of the morning.
"By jove," yawned the Member, as he
put out the candle, "on my word, much
as I hate hunting stories, I do really be-
lieve the chatter of the shires, half a cen-

And when the Member made this ob-

are sane upon the subject of cycling.

blished company to underwrite the shares.
Q. When the prospectus is launched,
what further step becomes desirable?
A. It is considered by experts a good
plan to give the new venture a hearty
send-off by inviting chosen represen-
tatives of the Press to dinner.
Q. But how does this banquet affect the
fortunes of the Isle of Sky and Qolden
Eldorado Copper Mines of Timbuctoo,
Limited, or some corporation of a kindred
nature?
A. It has the desired effect of suggest-
ing to the chairman of the company that
of the journalist with the aid of a menu
card.
Q. Is the title of the promoted com-
pany of the first importance?
A. Certainly; for the title is the hook
(baited with the names of suitable direc-
tors) that is intended to catch the golden
fish swimming in the direction of Capel
Court.
Q. Describe a "suitable director."
A. A suitable director is a person- with
a title or a reputation, who does not mind
advertising either or both at the head of
a prospectus.
Q. After becoming a director, what
does this suitable person do?
A. If he be wise, he will hold his
tongue, receive his fees, and if he have
any shares in the company, be ready at
a moment's notice to unload.
Q. What is "unloading/1 P
A. The operation of giving up the old
love for some later fancy. When it is
couleur de rose, and shares are at a pre-
mium, then is the time to realize.
Q. When his cash has been paid, what
should the promoter do?
A. Gracefully retire from his esta-
blished venture, and promote something
else.
Q. What is the customary fate of the
company promoter?
A. A long run for his money, gene-
rally followed by an equally long run
from his creditors.

AH! them "Three R's" is mighty fine,
But if you 're poor, and a bread-winner,
You know the virtue—when you dine—
Of sitting to a well-cooked dinner!

But when a cove comes 'ome from work,

If the old hen knows 'ow to bile 'em,
But then, yer see, that needs some knack,

Он! what has become of deportment in dancing?
The dance of to-day is no dance, but a romp!
The once "light fantastic" is now heavy prancing,
Befitting a big Flanders horse, or VAN TROMP.
A Dutchman in knickers full primed with dull liquors,
Galumphing around in a heavy-heeled style,
Were as dear to the Muse as the clumsy high-kickers,
Whose antics might make e'en an elephant smile.
Terpsichore's rulings and Tiirrf.ydrop's schoolings
Are wholly ignored in the balls of to-day.
Delicate footings would now be dubbed foolings;
All "steps " disappear—lounging languor's dull way!
To "walk through" a sluggish quadrille like a yokel,
Or kick up your heels in a vulgar barn-dance,
Seems the choice of automata limp and unvocal,
Spasmodic of limb, and despondent of glance.
ChTwhere are the gallant old beaux plump and bloomy?
And where are the belles, with their prim pointed toes,
Who ambled with unction through halls high and roomy,
Arch-eyed, pink of cheek, and tip-tilted of nose?
It 's really too shocking, this languorous mocking
Of old-fashioned elegance, vigour, and verve!
The generous glimpse of an open-worked stocking
Our youths seldom thrill with, and scarcely deserve.
What great house and Court meant to pooh-pooh deportment,
Punctilious step and elaborate bow;
To tolerate dawdlers in dreary assortment,
Why " pantaloons" natty and "pumps " prim and pointed
Give way to cylindrical "bags," who can tell?
A maundering mollusk, dejected, disjointed,
Our "dancing" young fellow, or drawing-room "swell."
What profits plump calf or trim, tightly-hosed ankle
If hid by cloth tube or full floor-sweeping skirt?
W'hat profits complaint? Yet such horrors will rankle,
And Turveydrop tenderness terribly hurt.

'DOING TIME."
(Fancy Sparling Sketch—Old Style.)
LIFE IN A MOTOIl-VILLA.
(Being Pages from a very Modern Log-book.)
Monday.—Capital idea that about motor-houses I heard the
other day. Must invest in one at once. MARIA is charmed with
the notion. Says she 's too stout for cycling, and never gets
chanco of air. . . . Just been to the agent's—most obliging man
—showed us round his works, and gave us several trial runs.
He has got quite a little village on wheels, .from a family
mansion, weighing 3,000 tons, with lodge and front drive com-
plete, down to a delightful little six-roomed touring cottage, with
creepers, verandah, mudguard, cow-catcher, and automatic
brake—just the thing for a newly-married couple. However,
we eventually decided on a stylish-looking, but solidly-built
petroleum-fed villa, about 400 tons in weight, with pneumatic
tyres anda small front garden for the children, guaranteed to go
ten miles an hour against head winds, and insured against colli-
sions and explosions. Took it on a three years' lease, and en-
gaged an engineer on the spot, but mean to drive it myself as
much as possible. Had it sent round to Oxford Street to-night.
\Ve shall have to embark earlv to-morrow morning as the whole
street is on the move, and the rush of houses out of town is
something tremendous just now. Have already christened it
"Roly "—short for Petroleum Villa.
Tuesday, 4 A.M.—Roly was rather restive during the night,
and_ wanted to start off on its own accord before daybreak,
having had a double allowance of oil. I am sorry to say it tore
up the lamp-post to which it was tethered, but was chased by
a policeman and brought back safely. No other damage done,
except a shop window stove in and a bit of our front garden
chipped off. . . . We got away a little later than originally in-
tended, owing to the cook having struck, saying she wasn't
a-going to ride in a gipsy caravan. We finally arranged to
double her wages. The nurse nearly fell overboard with the
baby, but MARIA managed to stop her in time. Also TOMMY
was lost at the last moment, but we found him at last, eating
tarts in the engine-room, next to the kitchen. He was in a
dreadful state, all over oil. Little MAUDIB was rather fractious
at her strango surroundings, and her cries attracted the attention
of the police, who requested us to move on. This we did about
six o'clock, after taking in the milk. I myself drove, MARIA
keeping a lookout from a bedroom window. I managed very
well, with hints fropi the engineer, though I ran into the Marble
Arch shortly after starting, which delayed us a bit. However,
our abode held very well together, and we only dropped a
chimney-pot and a window-sash. We had an exciting race with
the latter, in trying to pass us on the wrong side of the road,
fouled the Park railings and exploded. We then forged ahead,
and turned south towards the river, oiling up at Putney Bridge.
I began to find the amount of petroleum consumed rather
heavy, having used up a large cisternful in the morning. Still,
I found the motion pleasant, but the housemaid was rather sea-
sick, and gave notice. GLADYS fell out of the nursery window,
on to a passing cart, fortunately, so we recovered her without
much trouble. We nearly stuck fast on the bridge, but managed
eventually to squeeze through, though we upset the front gate
and part of the garden walk into the river. Nothing further
happened till we got to Barnes, where we anchored for the day.
Our nerves were somewhat shaken, and we were rather glad of
a stoppage. There were also some repairs to be done, and the
engineer had to be discharged, as he said the machine required
whisky. He rolled off the back yard, so I declined to take him
aboard again. Shall run the show myself.
Wednesday.—Roly refused to budge this morning, and, un-
luckily, a local grocer threatened to sue us for obstructing his
"ancient light«." We had stopped in front of his shop, I found.
I pointed out that it was an excellent advertisement for him,
but he would not listen to reason. We were in danger of getting
mobbed, when somehow the apparatus started off automatically,
and ran away with us in the direction of Wimbledon Common.
Here we got off the tracks entirely, and, after a sériée of mis-
haps, landed in a gravel-pit. MARIA made some rather unkind
remarks about my bad steering. I admitted I was only a
beginner, but I pointed out that we were in a most fortunate
position (though undoubtedly somewhat badly bunkered), as
gravel was now, so to speak, laid on, and we could execute some
needful repairs on our front walk. The roof was slightly
damaged by the fall, and showed signs of caving in, ana the
dining-room floor gave way, but otherwise Roly was as fit as
ever. We decided to picnic for dinner among the furze-bushes,
and bivouacked for the night outside, just as a change. No
further incident occurred, and the villa was quite quiet through-
out the night.
Thursday.—I spent the best part of the day trying to get our
abode out of the gravel-pit. We effected it at last, with the aid
of six steam-cranes, only to find that both our hind wheels * ere
punctured. This caused further delay, and we had almost to
turn Roly upside down. MARIA was considerably upset, ard
GLADYS rolled down the stairs and landed in the gorse. We got
under way at last, but did not go far, as we stopped at Rayne's
Park to pay a call. Our friend was delighted at seeing wo
had brought the whole establishment round. She said the
mountain was going to Mahomet, after all. Whether the villa
was trying to show off or not I don't know, but we finished the
evening by demolishing Mrs. E.'s front hedge, and generally
damaging the landscape.
Friday.—An off-day—that is to say, we were off, and lost our
way completely. A fog came on—most unusual in August—
and we ran over an old woman, though only going half-speed
and blowing foghorns all the time. After that we hove to.
Saturday.—Our at-home day, but no callers, as our friends had
apparently been unable to catch us up. The postman also had
failed to discover our whereabouts. After waiting till past tta-
time we made a move for Button, and soon set off at a brisk
pace. We passed a good many other motor-villas, detached and
semi-detached (or tandem), going along the Brighton road for
the week-end. MARIA thought she would like to drive for a
change, while I steered from the front gate. I successfully
eluded two tax-collectors and a gas-man, and knocked one с г
two writters down. We met the DE SNOOKSES in their auto-
bungalow going from Morden to Mitcham, but they were pur-
suing such an erratic course that we had to back into a hedge to
let them pass. Several large boarding-houses and a family hotel
overtook us, cutting up the roadway frightfully. They ought
not to be allowed to go more than ten miles an hour. Near
Benhilton, Roly jibbed rather at a dog-cart, horses being such
a strange survival in these days. At last MARIA put on a
spurt, and automated in fine style up Sutton High Street.
Unluckily, on nearing the top, the gradient proved too strong
for our tonnage, and our wheels began to go round the wrong
way. We rapidly descended the hill, back yard first. We
charged the church, tore up the pavement, cannoned into a
public-housfl, leaving our night-nursery behind. MARIA then
quite lost her head, while the steering apparatus got beyond my
control. With a superhuman effort., however, I managed to
direct Roly at the gasworks, which blew up on the impact,
severely shaking the baby. We then came to a standstill, and
were taken in charge by the local policeman for furious moting.
On the whole, we have had quite an exciting little expedition,
another villa going west, and were nearly being beaten, when
and shall not be averse to a Sunday rest.

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
''Тнв UNIVERSAL LITERARY SUPPLY COMPANY, LIMITED."
I HAVE just gone through a startling experience, and I desire
to communicate the details to the public before they shall have
faded from niy memory. It is of course a mero truism to say
that many strange things are being done in our very midst with-
out our being in the least aware of them; but it is certainly
extraordinary that anything connected with literature should at
the present day remain hid, for has not the man in the street
taken to literature, and do not countless periodicals, illustrated
interviews, articles on "How I do my work," with flash-light
photographs of eminent authors in the act of composition—do
not all these prove how deep and wide-spread is the public inte-
rest in all matters of literary concern? There are reasons, no
doubt, which would lead those who know the institution of which
I am going to speak to keep their knowledge to themselves.
These reasons, however, do not affect me; my withers are un-
wrung, though many a galled jade will wince when I have finished
my story. To my task, therefore.
I HAPPENED—it was on Friday last—to be wandering in one
of the less frequented streets in the neighbourhood of the Mile
End Road, when my attention was arrested by a small black
board hung over the entrance of a dingy block of buildings. I
scarcely know why I should have stopped; perhaps it was an
intuition, perhaps it was a mere chance. Anyhow, stop I did,
and read the following advertisement, painted in dirty white
letters on the board:—"The Universal Literary Supply Co.,
Limited. Office hours, 10 to 6. Knock and ring." Impelled
by an irresistible curiosity, I knocked and rang. There was a
shuffle of feet in the passage, the door was half opened, and the
untidy face of a house-wench peered dubiously at me. "I called
—I mean, I wanted to see "I began.
"Want to see the manager, I suppose," she interrupted ; " 'e 's
'avin a sangwich and a pint just лow, and p'raps if you 'd call
again "At this point, a door on an upper floor was opened,
and a gruff male voice, rendered thick by the mastication of
bread and meat, called down, "What 's up, SALLY?"
"Another on 'em wants to see you, Sir."
"Come, in Sir," she said to me; "fust door on the right on the
fust landin'. Mind yer 'at." I minded my hat, and walked
upstairs.
THE door indicated was open, and I stepped in. I found
myself in an immense room, brilliantly lit by electricity. Some
fifty clerks were busily writing at desks, and hardly noticed
my entrance. The walls were lined with cupboards and shelves,
all lettered and numbered. Huge iron boxes were ranged all
round the room. The atmosphere was heavy, a sort of mixture
of foolscap, ink, type-writers, proof-shoots, copying-presses, beer
whisky, and biscuit«. I cannot remember ever having noticed air of
this peculiar kind anywhere else, and yet, somehow, I recognised
it at once as familiar. I breathed it in with immense gusto,
and my hand strayed mechanically to the pocket in which I keep
my note-book. I did not know what notes I was going to set
down, but I felt that I must write something. Before I could
do so, however, an elderly man, with a grey moustache, a red
face, a brown alpacca jacket, a turn-down collar, a brilliant red
tie, baggy shepherd's plaid trousers, carpet-slippers, and with
three quill pens stuck behind his right ear, came up to me and
addressed me.
"I PRESUME," he said, "that you have the usual intro-
duction?"
"Introduction?" I faltered. "I don't quite know. What
kind of introduction do you mean P"
"Oh, well, any introduction will do. We prefer a note from
an editor, but publishers are accepted. Yes, we 've done a lot
of business through publishers. Of course, we can't supply
everybody—we do our best, but the business has grown so
enormously that we find that we can't accept fresh customers
without an introduction."
"Of course, of course," I said; "I quite see that; but I 'm
afraid I omitted to provide myself with one. I saw your notice,
and as it said you were universal, I thought I 'd step in. But
perhaps a cheque would do, a cheque signed by an editor, I mean.
I 've got one or two about me."
"Oh, yes, a cheque would do, though it's rather unusual.
We should not undertake to cash it, but if it is drawn for any-
thing over £5 there would be no difficulty."
As luck would have it I had that very morning received a
cheque for precisely that amount from dear old BOLDERS, the
editor of "Snapshots, with which is incorporated The Raffle." I
produced it with a certain modest pride. The effect was instan-
taneous.
"My dear Sir," said the manager, "such a reference is ample.
We shall be proud to open an account with you. What might
you require?"
This was another poser. I really had no notion what I re-
quired; indeed, I didn't know what class of goods the establish-
ment supplied.
"Perhaps," I ventured to say, "I might take a look round
first. I shall probably want a large order executed."
"By all means; delighted to show you round myself. All our
articles, I may mention, are of the very best. We receive them
direct from the manufacturers. Now, here," he continued, tap-
ping one of the iron boxea, "here we have a large consignment
of heroines."
"Of what?" I gasped.
"Of heroines," he went on, without moving a muscle;
"heroines of novels, you know. We used to let them have the
run of the place, but during the last year or two we found they
carried on so dreadfully with the clerks, and put such curious
ideae about marriage and all that into their heads, that we 'ye had
to keep them shut un. The mothers of the clerks complained a
good deal, and it 's always best to avoid rows. Shall I show you
one or two?"

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
''THE UNIVERSAL LITERARY SUPPLY COMPANY, LIMITED."
I HAVE just gone through a startling experience, and I desire
to communicate the details to the public before they shall have
faded from my memory. It is of course a mero truism to say
that many strange things are being done in our very midst with-
out our being in the least aware of them; but it is certainly
extraordinary that anything connected with literature should at
the present day remain hid, for has not the man in the street
taken to literature, and do not countless periodicals, illustrated
interviews, articles on "How I do my work," with flash-light
photographs of eminent authors in the act of composition—do
not all these prove how deep and wide-spread is the public inte-
rest in all matters of literary concern? There are reasons, no
doubt, which would lead those who know the institution of which
I am going to speak to keep their knowledge to themselves.
These reasons, however, do not affect me; my withers are un-
wrung, thouirh many a galled jade will wince when I have finished
my story. To my task, therefore.
I HAPPENED—it was on Friday last—to be wandering in one
of the less frequented streets in the neighbourhood of the Mile
End Road, when my attention was arrested by a small black
board hung over the entrance of a dingy block of buildings. I
scarcely know why I should have stopped; perhaps it was an
intuition, perhaps it was a mere chance. Anyhow, stop I did,
and read the following advertisement, painted in dirty white
letters on the board:—"The Universal Literary Supply Co.,
Limited. Office hours, 10 to 6. Knock and ring." Impelled
by an irresistible curiosity, I knocked and rang. There was a
shuffle of feet in the passage, the door was half opened, and the
untidy face of a house-wench peered dubiously at me. "I called
—I mean, I wanted to see "I began.
"Want to see the manager, I suppose," she interrupted ; " 'e 's
'avin a sangwich and a pint just .now, and p'raps if you 'd call
again "At this point, a door on an upper floor was opened,
and a gruff male voice, rendered thick by the mastication of
bread and meat, called down, "What 's up, SALLY?"
"Another on 'em wants to see you, Sir."
"All right, let him in."
"Come, in Sir," she said to me; "fust door on the right on the
fust landin'. Mind yer 'at." I minded my hat, and walked
upstairs.
Tu к door indicated was open, and I stepped in. I found
myself in an immense room, brilliantly lit by electricity. Some
fifty clerks were busily writing at desks, and hardly noticed
my entrance. The walls were lined with cupboards and shelves,
all lettered and numbered. Huge iron boxes were ranged all
round the room. The atmosphere was heavy, a sort of mixture
of foolscap, ink, type-writers, proof-sheets, copying-presses, beer
whisky, and biscuite. I cannot remember ever having noticed air of
this peculiar kind anywhere else, and yet, somehow, I recognised
it at once as familiar. I breathed it in with immense gusto,
and my hand strayed mechanically to the pocket in which I keep
my note-book. I did not know what notes I was going to set
down, but I felt that I must write something. Before I could
do so, however, an elderly man, with a grey moustache, a red
face, a brown alpacca jacket, a turn-down collar, a brilliant red
tie, baggy shepherd's plaid trousers, carpet>slippere, and with
three quill pens stuck behind his right ear, came up to me and
addressed me.
"I PRESUME," he said, "that you have the usual intro-
duction?"
"Introduction?" I faltered. "I don't quite know. What
kind of introduction do you mean?"
"Oh, well, any introduction will do. We prefer a note from
an editor, but publishers are accepted. Yes, we Ve done a lot
of business through publishers. Of course, we can't supply
everybody—we do our best, but the business has grown so
enormously that we find that we can't accept fresh customers
without an introduction."
"Of course, of course," I said; "I quite see that; but I'm
afraid I omitted to provide myself with one. I saw your notice,
and as it said you were universal, I thought I 'd step in. But
perhaps a cheque would do, a cheque signed by an editor, I mean.
I 've got one or two about me."
"Oh, yes, a cheque would do, though it's rather unusual.
We should not undertake to cash it, but if it is drawn for any-
thing over £5 there would be no difficulty."
As luck would have it I had that very morning received a
cheque for precisely that amount from dear old BOLDERS, the
editor of "Snapshots, with which is incorporated The Baffle." I
produced it with a certain modest pride. The effect was instan-
taneous.
"My dear Sir," said the manager, "such a reference is ample.
We shall be proud to open an account with you. What might
you require P"
This was another poser. I really had no notion what I re-
quired; indeed, I didn't know what class of goods the establish-
ment supplied.
"Perhaps," I ventured to say, "I might take a look round
first. I shall probably want a large order executed."
"By all means; delighted to show you round myself. All our
articles, I may mention, are of the very best. We receive them
direct from the manufacturers. Now, here," he continued, tap-
ping one of the iron boxes, "here we have a large consignment
of heroines."
"Of what?" I gasped.
"Of heroines," he went on, without moving a muscle;
"heroines of novels, you know. We used to let them have the
run of the place, but during the last year or two we found they
carried on so dreadfully with the clerks, and put such curious
ideas about marriage and all that into their heads, that we 'ye had
to keep them shut UD. The mothers of the clerks complained a
good deal, and it 's always best to avoid rows. Shall I show yon
one or two?"

DOING TIME."
(Fancy Sparling Sketch.—Old Siyle.)
LIFE IN A MOTOR-VILLA.
(Seing Pages from a very Modern Log-boot:.)
Monday.—Capital idea that about motor-houses I heard the
other day. Must invest in one at once. МАША is charmed with
the notion. Says she 's too stout for cycling, and never gets
chanco of air. . . . Just been to the agent's—most obliging man
—showed us round his works, and gave us several trial runs.
He has got quite a little village on wheels, ,from a family
mansion, weighing 3,000 tons, with lodge and front drive com-
plete, down to a delightful little six-roomed touring cottage, with
creepers, verandah, mudguard, cow-catcher, and automatic
brake—just the thing for a newly-married couple. However,
we eventually decided on a stylish-looking, but solidly-built
petroleum-fed villa, about 400 tons in weight, with pneumatic
tyres and a. small front garden for the children, guaranteed to go
ten miles an hour against head winds, and insured against colli-
sions and explosions. Took it on a three years' lease, and en-
gaged an engineer on the spot, but mean to drive it myself as
much as possible. Had it sent round to Oxford Street to-night.
We shall have to embark early to-morrow morning as the whole
street is on the move, and the rush of houses out of town is
something tremendous just now. Have already christened it
"Roly "—short for Petroleum Villa.
Tuesday, 4 A.M.—Roly was rather restive during the night,
and_ wanted to start off on its own acoord before daybreak,
having had a double allowance of oil. I am sorry to say it tore
up the lamp-post to which it was tethered, but was chased by
a policeman and ^brought back safely. No other damage done,
except a shop window stove in and a bit of our front garden
chipped off._. . . We got away a little later than originally in-
tended, owing to the cook having struck, saying she wasn't
a-going to ride in a gipsy caravan. We finally arranged to
double her wages. The nurse nearly fejl overboard with the
baby, but MARIA managed to stop her in time. Also TOMMY
was lost at the last moment, but we found him at last, eating
tarts in the engine-room, next to the kitchen. He was in a
dreadful state, all over oil. Little MATTDIE was rather fractious
at her strange surroundings, and her cries attracted the attention
of the police, who requested us to move on. This we did about
six o'clock, after taking in the milk. I myself drove, MARIA
keeping a lookout from a bedroom window. I managed very
well, with hints from the engineer, though I ran into the Marble
Arch shortly after starting, which delayed us a bit. However,
our abode held very well together, and we only dropped a
chimney-pot and a window-sash. We had an exciting race with
the latter, in trying to pass us on the wrong side of the road,
fouled the Park railings and exploded. We then forged ahead,
and turned south towards the river, oiling up at Putney Bridge.
I began to find the amount of petroleum consumed rather
heavy, having used up a large cisternful in the morning. Still,
I found the motion pleasant, but the housemaid was rather sea-
sick, and gave notice. GLADYS fell out of the nursery window,
on to a passing cart, fortunately, so we recovered her without
much trouble. We nearly stuck fast on the bridge, but managed
eventually to squeeze through, though we upset the front gate
and part of the garden walk into tbe river. Nothing further
happened till we got to Barnes, where we anchored for the day.
Our nerves were somewhat shaken, and we were rather glad of
a stoppage. There were also some repairs to be done, and the
engineer had to be discharged, as be said the machine required
whisky. He rolled off the back yard, so I declined to take him
aboard again. Shall run the show myself.
Wednexduy.—Roly refused to budge this morning, and, un-
luckily, a jocal grocer threatened to sue us for obstructing his
"ancient lights." We had stopped in front of his shop, I found.
I pointed out that it was an excellent advertisement for him,
but he would not listen to reason. We were in danger of getting
mobbed, when somehow the apparatus started off automatically,
and ran away with us in the direction of Wimbledon_ Common.
Here we got off the tracks entirely, and, after a sériée of mis-
haps, landed in a .gravel-pit. MARIA made some rather unkind
remarks about my bad steering. I admitted I was only a
beginner, but I pointed out that we were in a most fortunate
position (though undoubtedly somewhat badly bunkered), as
gravel was now, so to speak, laid on. and we could execute some
needful repairs on our front walk. The roof was slightly
damaged by the fall, and showed signs of caving in, ana the
dining-room floor gave way, but otherwise Roly was as nt as
ever. We decided to picnic for dinner among the furze-bushes,
and bivouacked for the night outside, just as a change. No
further incident occurred, and the villa was quite quiet through-
out the night.
Thursday.—I spent the best part of the day trying to get our
abode out of the gravel-pit. We effected it at last, with the aid
of six steam-cranes, only to find that both our hind wheels »ere
punctured. This caused further delay, and we had almost to
turn Roly upside down. MARIA was considerably upset, ard
GLADYS rollea down the stairs and landed in the gorse. We got
under way at last, but did not go far, as we stopped at Rayne's
Park to pay a call. Our friend was delighted at seeing wo
had brought the whole establishment round. She said the
mountain was going to Mahomet, after all. Whether the viila
was trying to show off or not I don't know, but we finished the
evening by demolishing Mrs. E.'s front hedge, and generally
damaging the landscape.
Friday.—An off-day—that is to say, we were off, and lost our
way completely. A fog came on—most unusual in August—
and we ran over an old woman, though only going half-speed
and blowing foghorns all the time. After that we hove to.
Saturday.—Our at-home day, but no callers, as our friends had
apparently been unable to catch us up. The postman also had
failed to discover our whereabouts. After waiting till past tea-
time we made a move for Sutton, and soon set off at a brisk
pace. We passed a good many other motor-villas, detached and
semi-detached (or tandem), going along the Brighton road for
the week-end. MARIA thought she would like to drive for a
change, while I steered from the front gate. I successfully
eluded two tax-collectors and a gas-man, and knocked one с г
two writters down. We met the DK SNOOKSES in their auto-
bungalow going from Morden to Mitcham, but they were pur-
suing such an erratic course that we had to back into a hedge to
let them pass. Several large boarding-houses and a family nctel
overtook us, cutting up the roadway frightfully. They ought
not to be allowed to go more than ten miles an hour. Near
Benhilton, Roly jibbed rather at a dog-cart, horses being such
a strange survival in these days. At last MARIA put on a
spurt, and automated in fine style up Sutton High Street,
unluckily, on nearing the top, the gradient proved too strong
for our tonnage, and our wheels began to go round the wrong
way. We rapidly descended the hill, back yard first. We
charged the church, tore up the pavement, cannoned into a
public-house, leaving our night-nursery behind. MARIA then
quito lost her head, while the steering apparatus got beyond n¡y
control. With a superhuman effort, however, I managed to
direct Roly at the gasworks, which blew up on the impact,
severely shaking the baby. We then came to a standstill, and
were taken in charge by the local policeman for furious moting.
On the whole, we have had quite an exciting little expedition,
another villa going west, and were nearly being beaten, when
and shall not be averse to a Sunday rest.

LTHE NEWEST PALACE OF (POSTER) ART.
(Fragments of the Cryptic Confession of a Dis-
illusionised Devotee of the Subterhuman and
Anti-natural.)
I BUILT my soul a poster-pleasure-house,
Wherein at ease to drowse and dwell.
I said, "Oh, soul, at nso-pagan nous,
Dear soul, thou orí a swell I"
A railway station big as Charing Cross
I dioso. Abundant space and height
Were needful. It had windows green ¡is
moss,
Which let in little light.
Posters I hung on every ledge and shelf,
O'er wall-place clear, or winding stair.
Mysoul could live alone unto herself
With her ideals there!
And "while the world plods round and
round," I said,
"Reign thou apart, a High-Art king,
Still as a parrot who, its supper made,
Sleeps in its brazen ring.
To which my soul made answer like a shot,
"You bet, my boy I Here I '11 abide
Far from old Nature's inartistic rot,
In superhuman pride I"
• * • •
Full of big bills and small the palace stood,
All various, each a perfect whole.
Unknit from Nature, fit for every mood
Of my superior soul.
For some were hung all gaudy green and
blue
Like Covent Garden at the morn;
Imps with lank cheeks and currant eyes
askew.
And wreathed satyr-horn.
One seemed all black and red—like Alum's
sands—
With Something ogling there alone,
A Bubterhuman shape, with spectral
hands,
And surplusage of bone.
One showed an inky coast and steely
waves,
Shaped like flat-irons big and small;
With orange-coloured nymphs who wanted
shaves,
Else vestured scarce at all.
And one a full-fed satyr waddling slow,
With harpies on a purple plain,
High-kicking horrors in a hideous row,
Dancing like imp« insane.
And one a causeway black with chunks and
crags,
Beyond some snaking lights, and higher
Two haggard shapes with serpentining
scrags,
And eyes of lurid fire.
Nor these alone, but every landscape
queer,
Smudge-slopped and inkily be-lined,
Haunted by vaporous shapes of fiendish
fear,
Like nought that is designed.
• • • •
Or a maid-monster just let loose from
Styx,
Nondescript, nameless, flat of form,
Tangled in arabesques—a curious fix—
Like rigging in a storm:
With eyes oblique which stared but could
not see,
A scarlet porter's knot her hair,
Wound round green temples; lips curled
mockingly
Sky-blue her bosom bare.
Nor these alone: but each chimera quaint

"THE ANCHOR'S WEIGHED."
(Sketched on an Excursion Steamer. )
Shaped from the inane, was there, in
lurid paint,
Like nought in life designed.
"Oh, all things rare to sate my morbid
eyes I
Oh, shapes and hues that please me
well!
Oh, bogey faces) Oh, mad phantasies!
My gods, with whom I dwell I
"Oh, High-Art isolation which art mine,
I can but count t lire perfect gain,
Watching the drudging droves of wash and
line,
The pretty and the plain I"
• • * •
So my soul throve and prospered, several
years
She boomed it; then a slump befell—
In posters ; though the public has long ears,
Horrors no more would sell.
Deep dread and loathing of sheer solitude
Longing for beauty and for human mond,
And freshness of the morn.
But in dark corners of her palace stood
Those spectral shapes; and unawares
She shrank from phantasies in ink and
blood,
Art's horrible nightmares;
And shapeless shades wrapt in fuliginous
flame,
And with lewd lips, faun-foreheads, all;
And was compelled to turn, for very
shame,
Their faces to the wall.
* * * •
So when the boom was wholly finished,
She threw its relics all away.
"It is small use to try and sell" she said,
"Posters no longer pay!
"Yet pull not down my palace walls,
which are
Substantially and strongly built.
Art is not all riddles crepuscular,
Which the supreme artistic mind
Of subterhuman guilt.
Fell on my soul, from which was born

(As arranged by the Commissioners of H.M.'s Office of Works.)
SCENE—Holyrood Park. TIME—Noon.
PRESENT—EDWIN and ANGELINA, seated beneath the trees.
Angelina (with enthusiasm). I can assure you the piece was
most amusing. The villain said, raising hie arm, "I hare been
the cause of the death of your brother."
Edwin (apprehensively). My own one, pray be careful, you art
giving a representation.
Angelina, (astonished). And why not? Surely I can tell you
what I saw at the theatre.
Edwin (sotto voce). My own, I fear that the Commissioners,
unless they authorise it, will not allow it.
Angelina (with a smile). How absurd. (Continuing her
story.) You see he laid hie hand upon her arm like this.
Edwin (looking around in alarm). Oh, don't, dear. As a
bnrrister I must tell you that that gesture may be taken as an
"action in dumb show." You are really seriously infringing
the by-laws.
Angelina (pouting). You are very disagreeable. I always
thought you so clever! And now I believe you are dull and
silly!
Edwin (distressed). My angel, you know that I would not
harm a hair of your head; still, it is only right to say that such
a speech as yours might be held as an act calculated to provoke
я breach of the peace.
Angelina (testily). You wish to irritate me I
Edwin (imploringly). How can you say such cruel things!
But Holyrood is now under new rules, and we must be bound
Angelina (after a moment's consideration). Well, we must
wait until we return to London. We will continue our conver-
sation in Kensington Gardens.
Edwin (mournfully). Alas! loved one, that would not better
the situation! The rules apply equally to them, and to St.
James's Park, the Green Park, Regent's Park, Primrose Hill,
Greenwich Park, Kew Gardens, Kew Green, Hampton Court
Gardens and Green, Richmond Park and Green, Linlithgow Peel
and Park, the Royal Botanical Gardens, Edinburgh, and the
Victoria Tower Gardens. (Gently, after a long pause.) My own,
my dearest, do speak to me. Come (with an attempt at gaiety),
a penny for my thought«?
Policeman MacX. (confronting them). Now, Sir, I have
caught you in the very act. Asking for a penny when the regu-
lations say "that no money shall be solicited or collected in
connection with any performance, recitation, or representation,
And thinking tí a performance, as you know as well as me.
Edwin (icith dignity). Constable, I am a counsel. If you
knew the by-laws you quote so glibly you would be aware that-
all this may be done "by permission of the Commissioners of
Her Majesty's Office of Works."
Angelina (in tears). Oh, we haven't got a permission!
Policeman AlacX. (sternly). Then, Sir, all you will have to do
is to pay a penalty not exceeding £5. That is when the charge
is proved.
Edwin (after a moment's hesitation). Constable, you are a
пит of the world. Do you not think that half-e-crown, payable
at once to you, would do us well P

ITHE NEWEST PALACE OF (POSTER) ART.
(Fragments of the Cryptic Confession of a Dis-
illusionised Devotee of the Subterhuman and
Anti-natural.)
I вшьт my soul a poster-pleaeure-house,
Wherein at ease to drowse and dwell.
I eaid, "Oh, soul, at neo-pagan nova,
Dear soul, thou art a swell 1"
A railway station big as Charing Cross
I those. Abundant space and height
Were needful. It had windows green as
moss,
Which let in little light.
Posters I hung on every ledge and shelf,
O'er wall-place clear, or winding stair.
Mysoul could live alone unto herself
With her ideale there 1
And "while the world plods round and
round," I said,
"Reign thou apart, a High-Art king,
Still as a parrot who, its supper made,
Sleeps in its brazen ring.
To which my soul made answer like a shot,
"You bet, my boy I Here I '11 abide
Far from old Nature's inartistic rot,
In superhuman pride I"
• * * *
Full of big bills and small the palace stood,
All various, each a perfect whole.
Unknit from Nature, fit for every mood
Of my superior soul.
For some were hung all gaudy green and
blue
Like Covent Garden at the morn;
Imps with lank cheeks and currant eyes
askew.
And wreathed satyr-horn.
One seemed all black and red—like Alum's
sands—
With Something ogling there alone,
A subterhuman shape, with spectral
bands,
And surplusage of bone.
One showed an inky coast and steely
waves,
Shaped like flat-irons big and small;
With orange-coloured nymphs who wanted
shaves,
Else vestured scarce at all.
And one a full-fed satyr waddling slow,
With harpies on a purple plain,
High-kicking horrors in a hideous row,
Dancing like imp« insane.
And one a causeway black with chunks and
crags,
Beyond some snaking lights, and higher
Two haggard shapes with serpentining
scrags,
And eyes of lurid fire.
Nor these alone, but every landscape
queer,
Smudge-slopped and inkily be-lined,
Haunted by vaporous shapes of fiendish
fear,
Like nought that is designed.
* • • •
Or a maid-monster just let loose from
Styx,
Nondescript, nameless, flat of form,
Tangled in arabesques—a curious fix—
Like rigging in a storm:
With eyes oblique which stared but could
not see,
A scarlet porter's knot her hair,
Wound round green temples; lips curled
mockingly
Sky-blue her bosom bare.
Nor these alone: but each chimera quaint

THE ANCHOR'S WEIGHED.'
(Sketched on an Excursion Steamer.)
Shaped from the inane, was there, in
lurid paint,
Like nought in life designed.
* • » *
"Oh, all things rare to sate my morbid
eyes I
Oh, shapes and hues that please me
well!
Oh, bogey faces! Oh, mad phantasies!
My gods, with whom I dwell!
"Oh, High-Art isolation which art mine,
I can but count thee perfect gain,
Watching the drudging droves of wash and
line,
The pretty and the plain!"
» * • •
So my soul throve and prospered, several
years
She boomed it; then a slump befell—
In posters ; though the public has long ears,
Horrors no more would sell.
Deep dread and loathing of sheer solitude
Longing for beauty and for human mood,
And Freshness of the morn.
But in dark corners of her palace stood
Those spectral shapes; and unawares
She shrank from phantasies in ink and
blood,
Art's horrible nightmares;
And shapeless shades wrapt in fuliginous
flame,
And with lewd lips, faun-foreheads, all;
And was compelled to turn, for very
shame,
Their faces to the wall.
* • • •
So when the boom was wholly finished,
She threw its relics all away.
"It is small use to try and sell," she said,
"Posters no longer pay I
"Yet pull not down my palace walls,
which are
Substantially and strongly built.
Art is not all riddles crepuscular,
Which the supreme artistic mind
Of subterhuman guilt.
Fell on my soul, from which was born

AMONGST much interesting reading in

A glance down this review convinces

Mr. WALLACE does not like Mr. HENLEY,

into full invective, and knocks together
the heads of the hapless joint editors till

Anon we see his silver back
Rush madly up the stream,
And then he takes another tack,
An effort that 's supreme;
He tries to leap the rocky wall
That environs the pool.
How hot that rush! How low that fall!
While you are calm and cool.
You utter not a word; your wrist
Must surely be of steel;
For, let your captive turn or twist,

CONDENSED CONFIDENCE.
(For Ladies only. )
DEAREST KIHKUMIA,—I have done it, moi qui vous parle.
Henceforward look upon me as devoted to the most reckless
dissipation on the most immoral lines. That I am sure is the
impression which my conduct would suggest at Little Pigglewick,
where your dear father has for so many years and so vehemently
inveighed from the pulpit against the sins of the turf, on the
Sunday before the Derby. And yet I, who was at one time a
lambkin in his Sock, have strayed among the wolves, and actually
seen the race for the St. Leger Stakes at Doncaster, which till
then I only knew by reason of ite succulent butter-scotch.
It was in this wise. Papa and I were staying at the NIBBLE-
THORPE-NoBBBs's, near York, when Lord ARTHUR RANTIPOLB im-
plored me to accept a seat on his coach (which he takes about with
him like a hat box), and, ma mie, as does the damsel in the play,
I fell before les beaux yeux de son altesse. Lord ARTHUR is one
of those unfortunate noblemen, who is married but not wedded.
Many years ago, when a mere boy, he was entrapped by the
charms of a female (I cannot call her anything else), who posed
in the chorégraphie ranks of a theatrical company, collected for
the purpose of showing the advantage of beauty unadorned. He,
as he has often told me, out of pure chivalry espoused this
creature. He was sans peur if she was not sans reproche. I
need not !<•!! you how the ill-fated alliance ended; but this I do
know, it icos all her fault. He has given her. in the noblest
way possible, every chance of releasing herself from this odious
entanglement, but she refuses to accept the opportunities.
Meantime she is a constant drain on his income and a stumbling-
block in his career. "Ah, КAIU" (we are on most friendly
terms), he said, only the other night, "if you only knew what
it is to bear it and grin." Papa says that Lord ARTHUR was refer-
ring to the Stock Exchange; but I never take any account of Ais
remarks.
Mrs. PLANTAGBNET-NIBBS, who of course was of the party, sug-
gested a " sweep " over the great event. I did not at first gras)
her meaning, thinking it had something to do with smok>
chimneys. Not so the rest of the party, and we were very
shortly afterwards, after paying five shillings a-pieoe, engaged
in taking slips of paper out of Mr. NIBBLETHORPB-NOBBES'B hat.
I drew ahorse called Phoebus Apollo (quel joli nom f), but nobody
thought I should win; though Mr. SWINBURNE JENKINS offered
me ten shillings for my chance of taking the pool. "Pos si
bete!" I reph'ed, much to the discomfiture of the poet. Lady
TTPINA TIPCAT, having obtained H.R.H.'s noble steed Per-
simmon, was so elated that she handed a whole five-pound note
to a smart-looking individual, who implored her "to back her
fancy for a place." But when the Prince conquered, he did not
appear tí pay her Ladyship her winnings. Sir WILLOUOHBY
WEAR said that he must have come from Wales. I_ did not
know that the gallant little principality, so famous for its leeks,
Sir WATKIN WILLIAMS-WYNN and Mr. LLOTD-GBOKOB, could be
capable of producing such inhabitants; but Sir WILLOUOHBT re-
marked that he had never come across such unscrupulous beings
as those who are born the legitimate subjects of the Heir Ap-
parent to the throne of Great Britain. In this opinion he was
supported by Mr. KAMP-TuLicoN, who was exceedingly annoyed
that his sister should have imperilled five shillings with the same
unprincipled individual.
Mr. SWINBURNE JENKINS, who insisted on our drinking to
the memory of poor JAMBS THE FOURTH of Scotland, it being the
anniversary of Flodden Field, at once began an ode on the race,
He wrote on the back of an envelope, and I know that the first
two lines ran : —
"Light the beacon on Snowdon and mighty Plinlimmon!
For the tale that is told of the hero Persimmon."
There was a good deal more, but the groom, who looked after
the refreshments, inadvertently swept the paper into the ice-
pail, where the fugitive lines were speedily destroyed, to the
great and natural wrath of the bard. Lord ARTHUR—toujours
à propos—said that Mr. JENKINS ought to be called "the W7ater
poet, with a(n) ice sentiment." It would be useless for me to
attempt to describe the scene. This intoxicating combination
of colour and life, the Yorkshire dialect, the yells and the cheers
when H.R.H.'s success was known, made me feel quite reck-
less, despite the doleful drizzle, and I threw pence to the negro
minstrels with the prodigality of an Eastern satrap. And the
costumes! There were some actresses in a break near our coach

what annoyed by the presence of ces dames, and carefully avoided
looking at them.
Not so Lord ARTHUR, who waved his hat to the party, and
afterwards entered into conversation with them. But, as usual,
noblesse oblige; Lord A. says that he feels it his duty to be all
things to all women. I need not write more, for you will have
read the daily papers, but I most strongly advise you, after going
to races, to breakfast on the following morning as I did—taking
the advice of dear Lord ARTHUR—on the soda water, which is
always associated with the name of * and the red herring,
for which Messrs. * are so celebrated in the fish-curing world.

QUEER QUERIES.
AUTUMN ARRANGEMENTS.—I am about to
take a late holiday, and wish to see Swit-
zerland, the Austrian Tyrol, Italy, and Ma-
deira. Can I get there and back, and tour
about for three weeks for £4 10s.? If not,
would some other tourist take me with
him and pay my expenses, if in return I
looked after the luggage, secured rooms
at hotels, and so on? I don't know any
foreign language, and have never been
abroad before, but am active and easy
to get on with when not ruffled.
QUITS ACCOMMODATING.
AIDS то HKAI.TII.—Will some medical
man (without fee) advise me as to my

than eight or nine hours, and after sitting
in a draught for a long time I am apt to
catch a cold in the head. Then, after a
full meal, with unlimited spirits, I ex-

fused admittance at two hospitals. A

good place to go to for the autumn,

forts, and meet no English people? Must

why my Dorking hen fails to bring off the
brood of young chickens I have been ex-

her on the eggs—three dozen of them—
somewhere in June, and shut her up in
an outhouse under a bucket, as I was told
this was the proper way. She has not

THE COMPLETE SPEECH-MAXES.
WE are enabled to give the following
extracts from a very important collection
of speeches, to be published shortly.
The first of the series, on "the floating
form of the knightly emperor" was de-
livered at Gorlitz on the 8th inst.
To the King of the Belgians.—ОЪ, royal
ruler of Belgium and King of the Congo 1
with great joy see I yet again thy tmy
and delicate hgure I Thou too Invest to
travel as I, and goest from Saturday to
Monday to Corfu, or to Montreux for the
day. Hail, royal fellow-tripper I In this
speech say I no word about LOTH,uUK, ex-
cept that, if he a German been had, never
had we even him tried. I love sucn men,
if only they Germana are. Now say 1 yet
again that the sight of thy sweet and
sylphlike shape my stern soldier-life
sweetens. Some day perhaps come I to
Ostend my luck at thy gambling tables to
try. Then canst thou perhaps me a tip
give. Hoch! hoch! hoch!
To the King of Spain.—Oh, mighty
monarch, successor of the sovereigns who
the rich realms of Spain ruled, gladly
gaze I again at thy terrible and towering
Hirui! llailst thou a German been, then
in my Pomeranian Grenadiers wouldst
thou nobly served have. But now fights
thine army against the rebels in Cuba. I
drink, oh colossal King, to the success of
thy soldiers! If thou me to say couldst,
whether this a good time Havana cigars
cheap to buy is, very much obliged would
I be. Hoch! hoch! hoch!
To the Sultan.—Oh, courageous Com-
mander of the Faithful, how rejoice I
thine alert and active form, ever fearless
in the fight for the good of that nation
which so happy as to call thee its ruler is,
to see! Thou lovest not a life of luxury
and laziness. Thou leavest not thy people
to the mercy of murderous miscreants.
Strive then as ever, oh, Sultan 1 sleepless
in thy solicitude for thy subjects. And if
thou, whom but sherbet dnnkest, in the
cellars of Yildiz Kiosque some rare old
wines discover shouldst, perhaps some tip-
top tokay or some sublime port, forget
not thy friend, the ruler of Germany,
where temperance in words or deeds not
enforced is. Hoch! ЛосЛ / hoch!
To the French President. — Oh, proud
and peerless President, successor of the
never-to-be-forgotten and altogether-un-
surpassable Emperor NAPOLEON THE FIRST,
as thy fairylike form forward before our
fascinated faces floate, see we in thee the
eminent embodiment of the lithe and
lightsome lissomeness of thy nimble na-
tion, and, more than ever, long I thy cap-
tivating and coruscating capital to visit,
in order there to see, perhaps at the
Casino de Paris or the Moulin Rouge,
forms that in the daring dance even
more freely than thine float 1 Perhaps in
the year 1900 come I. Auf wiedersehen!
Hoch! hoch! hoch!
"G. B.," writing from New York,
U.S.A., sends a cheque for £4 "for the
Little Hero," which has been forwarded.
He says, "Perhaps LEONARD STEELE
wants a bicycle, ana this may help him to
get one, and let him know that at least
one American appreciates his noble deed."

WB are enabled to gire the following
extracts from a very important collection
of speeches, to be published shortly.
The tir.it of the series, on "the floating
form of the knightly emperor" was de-
livered at Gorlitz on the 8th inst.
To the King of the Belgians.—Oh, royal
ruler of Belgium and King of the Congo!
with great joy see I yet again thy tiny
and delicate hgurel Thou too Invest to
travel as I, and goest from Saturday to
Monday to Corfu, or to Montreux for the
day. Hail, royal fellow-tripper I In this
speech say I no word about ho THAI HE, ex-
cept that, if he a German been had, never
had we even him tried. I love such men,
if only they Germans are. Now say I yet
again that the sight of thy sweet and
sylphlike shape my stern soldier-life
sweetens. Some day perhaps come I to
Ostend my luck at thy gambling tables to
try. Then canst thou perhaps me a tip
give. Hoch! hoch! hoch!
To the King of tipain.—Oh, mighty
monarch, successor of the sovereigns who
the rich realms of Spain ruled, gladly
gaze I again at thy terrible and towering
form I I l.-nKt thqu a German been, then
in my Pomeranian Grenadiers wouldst
thou nobly served have. But now fights
thine army against the rebels in Cuba. I
drink, oh colossal King, to the success of
thy soldiers! If thou me to say eouldst,
whether this a good time Havana cigars
cheap to buy is, very much obliged would
I be. Hoch! hoch! hoch!
To the Sultan.—Oh, courageous Com-
mander of the Faithful, how rejoice I
thine alert and active form, ever fearless
in the fight for the good of that nation
which so happy as to call thee its ruler is,
to see 1 Thou lovest not a life of luxury
and laziness. Thou leavest not thy people
to the mercy of murderous miscreants.
Strive then as ever, oh, Sultan 1 sleepless
in thy solicitude for thy subjects. And if
thou, whom but sherbet dnnkest, in the
cellars of Yildiz Kiosque some rare old
wines discover shouldst. perhaps some tip-
top tokay or some sublime port, forget
not thy friend, the ruler of Germany,
where temperance in words or deeds not
enforced is. Hoch! hoch ! hoch!
To the French President. — Oh, proud
and peerless President, successor of the
never-to-be-forgotten and altogether-un-
surpassable Emperor NAPOLEON THE FIRST,

eminent embodiment of the lithe and
lightsome lissomeness of thy nimble na-
tion, and, more than ever, long I thy cap-
tivating and coruscating capital to visit,

Casino de Paris or the Moulin Rouge,

"G. B.," writing from New York,
U.S.A., sends a cheque for £4 "for the
Little Hero," which has been forwarded.
He says, "Perhaps LEONARD STEELE
wants a bicycle, and this may help him to
get one, and let him know that at least
one American appreciates his noble deed."

OUK BOOKING-OFFICE.
THE anonymous writer of Here and
There Memories (FwHEB UNWIN) under-
takes a perilous task. In varied experi-
ence, my Baronite finds few things more
wearisome than the company of the man
who fancies himself as a story-teller. His
existence is made endurable by the fact
that he is usually constrained by a time
limit. He can tell his stories only as long
as the dinner laste. H—В—N has a
whole volume to fill, pouring out page
after page of anecdote, to do him justice,
without pretence of sequence. Some are
good; ot hers require for full enjoyment a
preliminary glass of punch and a contem-
porary pull at the pipe. H—R—N's ex-
perience has been extensive and peculiar.
He has rollicked through Ufe much after
the fashion of Charles O'Malley, and Tom
Burke of Ours. He has known everyone,
from the Emperor NAPOLEON to JACQUES
Eu, money-lender of Great Queen Street,
Westminster. Of these two he tells what
is not the least amazing story in the book.
"NAPOLEÓN Ш.," he writes, "did not for-
get ELI, whom he had known as Prince
CHARLES Loins NAPOLEÓN BONAPABT»."
But perhaps R—H—N did not really mean
to affirm that, the money-lender had been
posing as the Prince. It is a catastrophe
of conjunctions, and grammar is not our
authors strong point. It shows how,
even when he means to be serious, an
Irishman drops into drollery.
The Seats of the Mighty is the infelici-
tous title given by GILBERT PABKBB to bis
latest romance, which seems like a poor
imitation of his own style and manner.
It begins well, but soon ceases to be in-
teresting. THE BABÓN.
L'ILE DE WIGHT.
DEAR MISTER,—After to have visited my friends in Scotland,
I am come here to Sandown to pass some days at—chez, how eay
you P—one other friend. It is a long voyage, but in the superb
sleeping from Edimbourg to London one sleeps so well—ah out,
so well I—that one gete himself up the morning fresh as some
daisies, as one says in your country. And one pays all simply
five shillings of supplement. That is very little. From Calais
to Cannes one pays 100 francs. Only two times the distance,
and sixteen times the price I Ah, the drolls of little trains on
your Island of Wight! They are as droll as the bathings
machines at Sandown, only they go not so rapidly. Sometimes the
English mock themselves of our french trains. However you com-
plain yourself also of your trains to you, above all in the south
part of England. But go then to essay your trains of the bland of
Wight, and you will not laugh more of the french trains. It is all
this that he has there of the most drolls. And also of the most dears.
The prices are changed without casing. They are changed for
the soldiers, for the sailors, for the childs, for the workmen,
for the yacht men, for the excursionista, for the families. One
day the price is more, one other day he is less. If one voyages
by one train there will be the prices of the third class, by one
other train not at all. Th • i,• is the ticket of the third class, but
no waggon of the thirds. There is the waggon of the seconds,
less comfortable than the thirds of the other english railways,
but the prices are the ordinary prices of the firsts. The prices
of the firsts are enormous, and these waggons, in summer, are
ordinarily full of the voyagers of the third class, for whom there
was not enough of place in the seconds.
Thus often I am forced to mount in the fourgon des bagages—
the baggages truck—with the conductor of the train. Figure
to yourself how I seated myself—me AUGUSTE—at the middle of
the baggages 1 But I laughed, and my friend laughed, and the
conductor laughed, and alldnys— toujours—I offered to the con-
ductor a cigar, and he took it to smoke chez lui, and said
"Thanqui, maounsiah." They are brave boys, those conductors
there. And they said all "Maounsiah," as all the men of the
that my friend told me this word is all simply "M'sieu" in
english. .1 la bonne heure! But we amused ourselves well.
The most part of the trains go very slowly. The grande
vitesse is truly petite vitesse—little quickness—and we go all by
the little quickness as if we were baggages. But there is one
train which is superb, it is the Orient Express of the Island of
Wight, the rapid from Ride to Ventnor. At Sandown it is one
of the objecte of interest to see to pass this train. He traverses
the country like a meteor, before one can speak, as you say in
your country, of JOHN ROBINSON, he is gone. It is marvellous!
And I go to tell you it, I have not seen him of all I
Several times my friend and me we walked ourselves to the sta-
tion towards the three hours to see pass the express. Sometimes
we were in delay—en retard—sometimes the train was in delay and
we waited not. One time I saw on the horizon a cloud of dust,
but the train came not, be had passed, he went himself away to
Ventnor. In fine one day we waited at the station, we resolved
ourselves to see him. It was tedious. But we waited. Then
my friend said "Let us cross the line and wait on the other
platform." I consented, I followed my friend, we descended
the steps, we were in the tunnel. At that instant there we
heard a noise at above, a noise as the thunder, we hastened our-
selves, we ran, we mounted the steps as fast as possible, but still
one time, ратЫеи—by blue—I was too latel I had heard, but I
had not seen, the Orient Express of the Island of Wight.

PROVINCIAL SKETCHES.
No. I.—OUR TOWN.
THIS is our town. What say you, Sir?—A trifle dull and flat, Sir?
I beg you will not speak of us in such a way as that, Sir,
For, whatsoever others in their ignorance may think, Sir,
We know ourselves Creation's cream and Culture's very pjnk, Sir.
What do we do ?—Well, mostly after breakfast, sun or гат; Sir,
We play a round of golf, and after lunch we play again, Sir;
And after dinner we discuss the fortunes of the day,
Or comment pretty freely on our adversaries' play.
We can't imagine how we came to foozle at the burn;
We vow it was the vilest luck, that stimy at the turn;
You noticed our long iron from the bunker at the seventh, Sir?
And what a fluke the Major made approaching the eleventh, Sir!
But if you 're not a golfer, we have lions here ad libitum,
And I shall be delighted, I assure you, to exhibit 'em;
We'll take the churches first, I think—there's something like
a score of them,
Or possibly, for aught I know, there may be rather more of them.
See, there ;s the Parish Kirk. The style? Well, no, not per-
pendicular,
Nor does it much resemble any other in particular.
Beside it is the Catholic Church, behind it the Ü. P.,
And higher up the Methodists', and lower down the Free,
And up the court the Baptists, down the slum the Congrega-
tionaliste,
And here and there and everywhere still more denommationalists.
But here we are at Market Street. Look round you as you enter!
This is the spot our parsons call "The city's pulsing centre,"—
A phrase we never fail to hear with faithful regularity
Perhaps, if you 're a Cockney, used to London noise and riot, Sir,
Our other roads may possibly appear a little quiet. Sir;
Few people drive about them but the butcher or the grocer,
Our North Street is not quite the Strand, nor Paternoster Row,
Sir.
But here, at least, in Market Street, there's always something
going on,
Here, as the parsons say, "the tide of life is ever flowing on,"—
I told you so! Come when you will, there 's something still to see,
And look! There's Grip, the butcher's bull-dog, hunting for
a flea t
And there 's the butcher, too, by Jove, with portly corporation,
Who watches (trip's exciting sport in lazy contemplation.
And there is MAT — alack the day! — the milkman's pretty
daughter, Sir,
Replenishing the milk-cans from a pail of chalk-and-water, Sir I
But hold! Why dally with the deeds of vulgarised democracy?
For lo 1 here comes the jewel of our local aristocracy!
Ah! Miss JOANNA meets mine eye, Minerva-like Divinity I
More chaste than Dian, pure as snow—unparalleled Virginity!
She comes I She comes! We "11 cross the street and reverently
greet her,
And p'rhaps 'twill be as well to drop this somewhat flippant
metre.
And our cigars. She brooketh not the odours of Havannah, Sir,
Now, are you ready? Then, here goes! Allow me—Miss JOANNA,
Sir.
Overheard at the East End.
Sanitarian. By hook or crook a man must drink and wash,
The poorest has a whistle, and must wet it!
Slum Dweller. Get it by hook or crook? Oh, that 's all bosh!
Whenever the collection is in aid of local charitv.
By hook or Crook(endon) T cannof get it!

L'ILE DE WIGHT.
DBAS MisiKit,—After to have visited my friends in Scotland,
I am come here to Sandown to pass some days at—chez, how say
you ?—one other friend. It is a long voyage, but in the superb
sleeping from Edimbourg to London one sleeps so well—ah but,
so well!—that one get« himself up the morning fresh as some
daisies, as one says in your country. And one pays all simply
five shillings of supplement. That is very little. From Calais
to Cannes one pays 100 francs. Only two times the distance,
and sixteen times the price I Ah, the drolls of little trains on
your Island of Wight! They are as droll as the bathings
machines at Sandown, only they go not so rapidly. Sometimes the
English mock themselves of our french trains. However you com-
plain yourself also of your trains to you, above all in the south
part of England. But go then to essay your trains of the Island of
Wight, and you will not laugh more of the french trains. It is all
this that he has there of the most drolls. And also of the most dears.
The prices are changed without Ceasing. They are changed for
the soldiers, for the sailors, for the childs, for the workmen,
for the yacht men, for the excursionists, for the families. One
day the price is more, one other day he is lees. If one voyages
by one train there will be the prices of the third class, by one
other train not at all. There is the ticket of the third class, but
no waggon of the thirds. There is the waggon of the seconds,
less comfortable than the thirds of the other english railways,
but the prices are the ordinary prices of the firsts. The prices
of the firsts are enormous, and these waggons, in summer, are
ordinarily full of the voyagers of the third clase, for whom there
was not enough of place in the seconds.
Thus often I am forced to mount in the fourgon des bagages—
the baggages truck—with the conductor of the train. Figure
to yourself how I seated myself—me AUGUSTE—at the middle of
the baggages! But I laughed, and my friend laughed, and the
conductor laughed, and alldays—toujours—I offered to the con-
ductor a cigar, and he took it to smoke chez lui, and said
"Thanqui, maounsiah." They are brave boys, those conductors
there. And they said all "Maounsiah," as all the men of the
that my friend told me this word is all simply "M'sieu" in
english. A la bonne heure! But we amused ourselves well.
The most part of the trams go very slowly. The gránele
vitesse is truly petite vitesse—little quickness—and we go all by
the little quickness as if we were baggages. But there is one
train which is superb, it is the Orient Express of the Island of
Wight, the rapid from Ride to Ventnor. At Sandown it is one
of the objecte of interest to see to pass this train. He traverses
the country like a meteor, before one can speak, as you say in
your country, of JOHN ROBINSON, he is gone. It is marvellous!
And I go to tell you it, I have not seen him of all!
Several times my friend and me we walked ourselves to the sta-
tion towards the three hours to see pass the express. Sometimes
we were in delay—en retard—sometimes the train was in delay and
we waited not. One time I saw on the horizon a cloud of dust,
but the train came not, he had passed, he went himself away to
Ventnor. In fine one day we waited at the station, we resolved
ourselves to see him. It was tedious. But we waited. Then
my friend said "Let us cross the line and wait on the other
platform." I consented, I followed my friend, we descended
the steps, we were in the tunnel. At that instant there we
heard a noise at above, a noise as the thunder, we hastened our-
selves, we ran, we mounted the steps as fast as possible, but still
one time, parbleu—by blue—I was too late! I bad heard, but I
had not seen, the Orient Express of the Island of Wight.

by means of " Odylic force."]
THURSDAY being about as sopping and miserable a day as one
could imagine, I automoted down, on behalf of Mr. Punch, to
interview the modern rainmaker in his villa at Beachdown upon
the subject.
"Good afternoon," I timidly remarked, as I found the wizard
perspiring in his shirt-sleeves, and busily preparing the evening's
weather in his laboratory. "I came to ask, if by any chance"
"Don't disturb me, pray," ejaculated the rainmaker. "The
War Office authorities have not paid me the twopence a head I
demanded for providing fine weather during the manœuvres, and
so I will make it hot—I mean damp—for them, with a vengeance.
By Jove, Sir, the country shall pay for it! I'll teach them a
lesson. Besides, I've a friend who's an umbrella-maker, and I
owe him a good turn."
"But, if you would kindly"
"Yes, yes, I know what you were going to »ay. But I 'm not
just at present in a kindly frame of mind, and the United King-
dom has got to know it. I showed you London people a sample
of my powers on Tuesday night, if you remember the little thing
in the way of thunderstorms that I turned off. I should have
let that loose on Salisbury Plain instead, if the London County
Council had only advanced me the little sum, the absurdly in-
adequate amount of three thousand pounds I asked for. How-
ever, I let them off easily, on the whole, and, besides, gave the
East London Water Company a bonus in the shape of extra
rainfall. But there, the way some things are mismanaged!
Take that Solar Eclipse, now."
"Yes, that iras a failure 1"
thing to be a most brilliant success, steady light, no clouds or
anything to interfere, for a paltry two thousand pounds. I
waited for it up to the last moment, but as my honorarium was
not forthcoming, of course I had to let them go on a false errand.
Those astronomers will be wiser next 'irae, I fancy! It is merely
a matter of pounds, shillings, and i ci./r."

JOTTINGS AND TITTLINGS.
(By BABOO HURRY BUNGSHO JABBERJEE, B.A.)
No. XXIII.
Mr, Jabberjee delivers his Statement of Defence, and makes his prepara-
tions for the North. He allows his patriotic sentiments to get the
better of him in a momentary outburst of disloyalty—to which no
serious importance need be attached.
MY fair plaintiff has not suffered the grass of inaction to
grow щит her feet, having already issued her Statement of
Claim, by which she alleges that I proposed marriage on a certain
date, and did subsequently, on divers occasions, treat her, in

"I am ;M.'| i r- -> ,! by an underbred street-urchin as a ' blooming blacky !'"
the presence of sundry witnesses, as an affianced, after which
I mizzled into obscurity, and on various pretexts did decline,
and do still decline, to fulfil my nuptial contract, by which con-
duct the plaintiff, being grievously afflicted in mind, body, and
estate, claims damages to the doleful tune of £1,000.
(N.B. — I have thought it advisable here and there to trans-
late the legal phraseology into more comprehensible verbiage.)
Now such a claim is to milk a ram, or prendre la lune avec
les dents, seeing that I am not a proprietor of even one
thousand rupees. Nevertheless (as I have informed Mr.
SMARTLE), my progenitor, the Mooktear, will bleed to any
reasonable extent of costs out of pocket.
I have held frequent and lengthy interviews with the said
SMARTLK, Esq., who is of incredible dispatch and celerity —
though I sometimes regret that I did not procure a solicitor of
a more senile and sympathetic disposition.
Assuredly had I done so, such an one would not, after per-
using my Statement of Defence^— a most magnificently volumin-
ous document of over fifty folios, crammed and stuffed with
satirical hite and sideblows, and pathetic appeals for the Bench's
indulgence, and replete with familiar quotations from best
classical and continental authors- — such an one, I say, would
not have split his sides with disrespectful chucklings, thrown
my composition into a wasted paper receptacle, and proceeded
to knock off a meagre substitute of his own, containing a very
few dry bald paragraphs, in the inadequately brief space of
under the hour.
Such, however, was Mr. SMARTLE'S course; and the sole
consolation is that, owing to his unprofessional precipitation,
the action was set down for trial previously to the commence-
ment of the Long Vacation, and my case may come on some time
next Term, and I be put out of my misery at the close of the year.
My aforesaid legal adviser, finding that I adhered with the
tenacity of bird-slime to my determination to conduct my case
in person, did hint in no ambiguous language, that it might
perhaps be even better for me to do the guy next November to
my native land, and snip my fingers then from a safe distance
at the plaintiff.
But it is not my practice to exhibit a white feather (except
when prostrated by severe bodily panics), and I am consumed
by an ardent impatience to air my fluencies and legal learned-
nese before the publicity of a London Law Court.
Now, begone dull carel for I am to dismiss all litigious
thoughts till October or November next, and become a Dolce
far niente, chasing the deer with my heart in the Highlands.
My volunteering acquaintance, by the way, has declined to lend
me his rifle, on the transparent pretence that it was contrary
to regulations, and that it was not the bon ton. to pursue grouse-
birds and the like with so war-like a weapon.
So, on young HOWARD'S advice, I made the purchase from a
pawnbroker of a lethal instrument, provided with a duplicate
bore, so that, should a bird happen by any chance to escape my
first barrel, the second will infallibly make him bite the dust.
I have also purchased some cartridges of a very pleasing
colour, a hunting knife, and a shot belt and pouch, and if I can
only procure some inexpensive kind of sporting hound from
the Dogs' Homo, I shall be forewarned and forearmed cap à pie
for the perils and pleasures of the chase.
Miss WKE-WEE did earnestly advise me, inasmuch as I was
about to go amongst the savage hill tribes of canny Scotians,
to previously make myself acquainted with their idioms, &c.,
for which purpose she lent me some romances written entirely
in Caledonian dialects, and the composition of Hon. Poet
BURNS.
But hoity-toity I after much diligent perusal, I arrived at the
conclusion that such works were sealed books to the most in-
telligent foreigner, unless he is furnished with a good Scotch
grammar and dictionary.
And mirabilr. diet«/ though I have made diligent inquiries
of various London booksellers, I have found it utterly impossible
to obtain such works in England—a haughty and arrogantly
dispositioned country, more inclined to teach than to learn 1
How many of your boasted British Cabinet, supposed to
rule our countless millions of so-called Indian subjects, would be
capable to sit down and read and translate—correctly—a single
sentence from the Mahábhárat in the original P
Not more, I shrewdly suspect, than half a dozen at mostl
So it is not to be expected that any more interest would be
displayed in the language and literature of a country like Scot-
land, which is notoriously wild and barren, and less densely popu-
lated and productive than the most ordinary districts of Bengal.
Oh, you pusillanimous Highland chiefs and other misters! how
long will you tamely submit to such offhanded treatment? Will
the day never come when, with whirling sporrans and flashing
pibrochs you will rise against the alien oppressor, and demand
Home Rule; together with the total abolition of present dis-
dainful British insouciance?
When that day dawns—if ever—please note this piece of
private intelligence from an authorised source: Toung_ Ttengal
will be vrith you in ymtr struggle for Autonomy. If not in body,
assuredly in spirit. Possibly in both.
I say no more, in case I should be accused of trying to stir up
s-pditious feelings; but, as a patriotic Baboo gentleman, my
blood will boil occasionally at instances of stuck-up English
self-sufficiency, and the worm in the bud, if nipped too severely,
may blossom into a rather formidable serpent I
As, for instance, when, in the course of an inoffensive prome-
nade, I am addressed by an underbred street-urchin as a
"blooming blacky," and cannot induce a policeman to compel
my aggressor to furnish me with his name and address or thit
of his parents, or even to offer the most ordinary apology.
Enough of these rather bitter reflections, however. I omitted to
mention that I am also the proprietor (at the same pawnbroker's
where I bought my breeches-loader gun) of a very fine second-
hand salmon-rod, a great bargain, and immense value, with
which I hope to be able to catch a great quantity of fishes.
For there is, according to young HOWARD, good fishing in a
burn adjoining the Manse, so I shall follow King Solomon's
injunctions, and not spare the rod and spoil the salmons, though
if I should happen to "spoil" my rod, the salmons would in-
evitnbly in consequence be "spared."
This is a sample of the kind of verbal pleasantries in which,
when in exhilarated high spirits, I sometimes facetiously indulge.

(A Possible Page from a Grand Old Diary. )
Monday. — Received letter begging me
to establish a cosmopolitan library. Seems
a simple idea. The notion is to translate
all the best books into foreign languages.
For instance, turn SHAKSPEARE into Chi-
nese and MOLIERE into Russian. If I had
not made up my mind to give up all seri-
ous literary work (save magazine articles,
fresh versions of Homer, and the like)
would consider the matter. But, under
the circumstances, think it best to de-
cline.
Tuesday. — Asked to re-organise the
State defences. A few years since, noth-
ing would have pleased me better. Of
course, know a good deal about both the
Navy and the Army. Could scarcely
have failed to pick up the knowledge
in the course of my reading. Have
somewhere or other plans for new forts
at tin' mouth of the Thames, round
the Isle of Wight, and on the more pro-
minent portions of the Channel Islands.
Have a scheme for national mobilization
in one of my pigeon-holes. Might do
something, too, with my double-action
rudder and extra explosive gun cotton.
But perhaps better leave the matter in
younger hands. Not that I shrink from
the responsibility, but doctor's orders are,
after all, doctor's orders.

Have of course, like every one else, J

No serious difficulty; but. to carry out the
idea properly, one should visit the various
parts of the empire in person. No objec-
tion to a trip to Australia, India, and
Canada, but doing the Cape and the Mau-
ritius would be weary work. So reluc-
tantly forced to decline.
Thursday. — For the fiftieth or six-
tieth time this year I am implored to
undertake an oratorical tour. I am to
create enthusiasm in England, Scotland,
and Wales. Not a difficult matter. In
fact, have done it before. Still, I must
remember that I am not as young as I
was, say, fifty years ago. However, very
tempting proposal, but afraid I can't
accept.
Friday. — " Will I save the British
fanner?" Same old question. All I
have to do is to establish jam manufac-
tories in every part of the United King-
dom. I have often thought of doing this,
but never have had the time. I could
work all the empty farms at the same
time. I don't know why I shouldn't, but
"powers that are " say I mustn't.
Saturday.—Cannot remain inactive any
longer. Asked to speak at a public meet-

Of course I will, and what's more, if they
don't listen to me, I will raise the nation

You laughed to see the wonder-stare

RETIREMENT IN RETREAT.
(A Possible Page from a Grand Old Diary.)
Monday. — Received letter begging me
to establish a cosmopolitan library. Seems
a simple idea. The notion is to translate
all the best books into foreign languages.
For instance, turn SHAKSPEARB into Chi-
nese and MOLIESE into Russian. If I had
not made up my mind to give up all seri-
ous literary work (save magazine articles,
fresh versions of Homer, and the like)
would consider the matter. But, under
the circumstances, think it best to de-
cline.
Tuesday. — Asked to re-organise the
State defences. A few years since, noth-
ing would have pleased me better. Of
course, know a good deal about both the
Navy and the Army. Could scarcely
have failed to pick up the knowledge
in the course of my reading. Have
somewhere or other plans for new forts
at tln> mouth of the Thames, round
the Isle of Wight, and on the more pro-
minent portions of the Channel Islands.
Have a scheme for national mobilization
in one of my pigeon-holes. Might do
something, too, with my double-action
rudder and extra explosive gun cotton.
But perhaps better leave the matter in
younger hands. Not that I shrink from
the responsibility, but doctor's orders are,
after all, doctor's orders.

ration of the English-speaking races.
Have of course, like every one else, J
suppose, the scheme worked out on paper.
No serious difficulty; but. to carry out the
idea properly, one should visit the various
parte of the empire in person. No objec-
tion to a trip to Australia, India, and
Canada, but doing the Cape and the Mau-
ritius would be weary work. So reluc-
tantly forced to decline.
Thursday. — For the fiftieth or six-
tieth time this year I am implored to
undertake an oratorical tour. I am to
create enthusiasm in England, Scotland,
and Wales. Not a difficult matter. In
fact, have done it before. Still, I must
remember that I am not as young as I
was, say, fifty years ago. However, very
tempting proposal, but afraid I can't
accept.
Friday.—"Will I save the British
farmer?" Same old question. All I
have to do is to establish jam manufac-
tories in every part of the United King-
dom. I have often thought of doing this,
but never have had the time. I could
work all the empty farms at the same
time. I don't know why I shouldn't, but
"powers that are" say I mustn't.
Saturday.—Cannot remain inactive any
longer. Asked to speak at a public meet-
ing to denounce the lowest scoundrel that
ever disgraced the nineteenth century I
Of course I will, and what's more, if they
don't listen to me, I will raise the nation
in revolt, provoke a general election, come
in at the head of the poll, and resume my
old rooms in Downing Street! To think
of the knave continuing his roguery 1
Well, it is not too late, and I am fit for
anything!
Sunday.—Customary service. Very
soothing. Calm and sedate. Perhaps,
after all, I had better reconsider the situa-
tion, or at any rate curtail the pro-

NOTES OF A LITTLE CRUISE Ш A

Oreenock, Saturday Morning.—Curious
arrangement of the sleeping berths in the
train which brought us up (" Like- a mush'
room," SAHK says) in the night. Not
equally divided. One side sacrifices some-
thing of its width to corridor passing full
length of car. Depends upon which side
you happen to be ticketed for whether
you get a broad bed or a narrow one.
Oddly enough, SABK didn't get the
broad bed. Almost wish he had. Being
short of temper, and bulky in person, he
spent an appreciable part of my night's
rest in grumbling. He was particularly
angry because we had each alike paid five
shillings for our bed.
"If you have five shillings' worth of
bed," he woke me up to say, the idea pre-
senting itself to him at 3.20 A.M., "mine
doesn't run beyond three-and-nine-penny-
worth at the most."
It 's a pity men allow these trifling mat-
ters to annoy them. If such a thing hap-
pens again, I think—the idea didn't occur
to me till we were running into Greenock

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BBISCOE says there "isn't enough water." Seems strange. Al-
ways heard that if there was a drawback to attractiveness of
Ireland, it was the too constant rain. Certainly it has been a dry
summer with us. Water famine at East End and the like.
Probably average not yet made up at Dublin. However it be,
instead of crossing Channel to Ireland, we steer up Scotch coast
to Lamlash Bay. A fresh injustice to Ireland.
After luncheon, went* ashore. Some question whether we
should be able to land. Rumour current that the pier is locked
up on Sundays. Advanced cautiously. Reconnoitred. Not a
soul in sight. Landed on pier. At gate a board proclaimed that
a fee of two-pence is levied on every passenger. Feel for
our coppers. A ghostly silence reigns over hut whence collector
might be expected to spring. Gate open; we walk through un-
taxed. Hope the collector not regarding ue from window of one
of the houses near. Pitiful to think of his emotions on seeing
bang go at least twenty twopences uncollected.
Turning to the left, we come on a long street, facing the turf-
edged sea. This is Lamlash, a congeries of lodging-houses, none
more than a story high. The lodgers are mostly on the cold
ground, sitting on chairs or benches in front of their apartmente.
They don't talk, much less "whustle." The nearest approach to
carnality is the possession of a spy-glass. Coming from Glas-
gow, and further inland, this gives the final touch of nautical
circumstance to the too brief holiday. From time to time one
puts up his spy-glass, slowly surveys scene in the bay, and
solemnly brings the glass back to his knee. They must have seen
it all before through many days. Nevertheless, at brief intervals
they sweep the horizon, always beginning at the same place, and
with slow motion leaving off as before.
"I think," said SARK, involuntarily dropping his voice to a
whisper, "they 're looking out for Monday, when they can talk
to each other again, bustle around, bathe, or even catch mussels."
A fair scene of Sabbath peace, broken only by the lapping of
the waves among the sea-weed on the beach. Meeting an elderly
gentleman, looking uncomfortable in an aggressively square-
built suit of rusty black, I ventured to expatiate on the beauty
of the scene. The patriot Scot evidently pleased at the
artless enthusiasm of a mere Southron. He hadn't a spy-glass
with him, having evidently just come out of church. But he
looked round in search of some climax in the peerless beauty of
the scene with which he might cap my remark that the people
living here were very fortunate, and ought to be happy.
"D'ye see that vessel lyin' avre there?" he said, pointing to a
good-looking craft, but as a penny steamer beside our stately
liner. "Weel, that 's the Jupiter. She sails every day between
Greenock and Lamlash. She 's the fastest boat on the Clyde,
and forbye that she beats them a' for breakfasts. Man, when ye
tak' ane o' her breakfasts ye need neither dinner nor supper, and'a'
for twa shillings a head. If ye tak' a dozen tickete at a time ye
get them for eighteen pence apiece. Sixteen breakfasts for the
price of twelve!"
As the old gentleman spoke, the light of the setting sun falling
en his furrowed face brightened it with a look of ecstasy. Six-
teen breakfast« for the price of twelve! At Lamlash Ufe is
certainly worth living.
Plymouth Harbour, Tuesday.—SARK is not in good luck this
trip. The narrow bed—"Put in it before my time," he says,
gruffly—was bad enough. This morning was worse. Thought he
would try the spray bath, of which he had heard high approval.
It's a framework of perforated pipes, within which you stand,
turn a wheel-handle, and water, hot or cold, dashes forth in fine
thick rain. SARK had heard that the thing to do is to turn on
both handles, modifying the heat according to taste. He began
with that labelled "hot water."
It was surprisingly hot. SARK dashed at the handle; gave it
another screw, meaning to tarn the water off. In excitement
of moment, blinded with the dashing spray, agonised by the nearly
boiling water, he turned it wrong way. The water played upon
him with redoubled force and heat.
SARK'B observations were, I am told, heard at some distance.
"Why didn't you step out of the enclosure?" I asked.
"You get in, and see what you'll do," he replied, its par-
boiled condition lending an almost evil glare to the countenance
turned upon me.
In the Channel, Thursday.—Steaming up Channel. A fine
autumn day, with the sea, blue as the Mediterranean, tossing
up countless white caps for pure joy at being alive. The very
day to sit on deck and read Report (just out) of Financial Rela-
tions between Great Britain and Ireland. Have done so, and
now, with Tilbury in sight, am in hopelessly dazed condition.
Talk about conference of Kilkenny cats, or meetings of Irish

"Dm YE SEE THE LORD MAYOK WHEN YOU WAS UP то LUNNON?"
"AYE, LAD, I DID."
"DE1 'E GANO ABOOT wi* A CHAIN!" "No; *E GANGS LOOSE!"
unanimous as compared with this Commission. The result is un-
paralleled amongst Blue Books.
First of all eleven of the thirteen commissioners agree
to a final joint report, which they sign. Item: This
done, five of them, the Chairman, Mr. REDMOND, Mr.
MARTIN, Mr. HUNTER, and Mr. WOLFF presente a report on
their own account. Item: Lord FARRER, Lord WELBY, and Mr.
CURRIE hand in their report. Item: Lord WELBY drafts a memo-
randum declaring wherein he disagrees from Lord FARREH and Mr.
CURRIE, whose report he has signed. Item: Mr. SBXTON, Mr.
BLAKE, and Mr. SLATTBRY sign a fourth report. Item: Mr.
BLAKE set« forth, at considerable length, pointe of difference he
holds with Mr. SEXTON and Mr. SLATTERY, whose report
carries his signature. Item: Sir DAVID BARBOUB has a
report that no one else will sign, even with the privi-
lege of supplementing it by a memorandum showing how it
is, in the main, hopelessly wrong. Item: Sir THOMAS SUTHER-
LAND, not to be outdone, presents a masterly report demonstra-
ting the unfairness and the impracticability of everything but his
own particular plan.
Am glad to have dropped anchor off Tilbury. A delightful
voyage, a noble ship, a princely host, charming company. But
after studying the Report of the Royal Commission on the
Financial Relations between Great Britain and Ireland one has
a strange, strong hankering for terra firma.
WAIST NOT WASTE NOT.
(faradofieal but Important.)
"IN Paris the 'wasp' waist is off," they declare.
This is excellent news to the wholesome and tasteful.
Adopt a full waist if your health you would spare,
It is the spare waist that is wasteful!

artless enthusiasm of a mere Southron. He hadn't a spy-glass
with him, having evidently just come out of church. But he
looked round in search of some climax in the peerless beauty of
the scene with which he might cap my remark that the people
living here were very fortunate, and ought to be happy.
"D'ye see that vessel lyin' avre there?" he said, pointing to a
good-looking craft, but as a penny steamer beside our stately
liner. "Weel, that 's the Jupiter. She sails every day between
Greenock and Larolash. She's the fastest boat on the Clyde,

Plymouth Harbour, Tuesday.—SARK ia not in good luck this
trip. The narrow bed—"Put in it before my time," he says,
gruffly—was bad enough. This morning was worse. Thought he
would try the spray bath, of which he had heard high approval.
It's a framework of perforated pipes, within which you stand,
turn a wheel-handle, and water, not or cold, dashes forth in fine
thick rain. SARK had heard that the thing to do is to turn on
both handles, modifying the heat according to taste. He began
with that labelled "hot water."
It was surprisingly hot. SABK dashed at the handle; gave it
another screw, meaning to turn the water off. In excitement
of moment, blinded with the dashing spray, agonised by the nearly
boiling water, he turned it wrong way. The water played upon
him with redoubled force and heat.
SARK'S observations were, I am told, heard at some distance.

boiled condition lending an almost evil glare to the countenance

Greenock, Saturday Morning.—Curious
arrangement of the sleeping berths in the
train which brought us up (" Like a mush-
room." SARK says) in the night. Not
equally divided. One side sacrifices some-
thing of its width to corridor passing full
length of car. Depends upon which side
you happen to be ticketed for whether
you get a broad bed or a narrow one.
Oddly enough, SAHK didn't get the
broad bed. Almost wish he had. Being
short of temper, and bulky in person, he
spent an appreciable part of my night's
rest in grumbling. He was particularly
angry because we had each alike paid five
shillings for our bed.
"If you have five shillings' worth of
bed," he woke me up to say, the idea pre-
senting itself to him at 3.20 A.M., "mine
doesn't run beyond three-and-nine-penny-
worth at the most."
It 's a pity men allow these trifling mat-
ters to annoy them. If such a thing hap-

BRISCOE says there "isn't enough water." Seema strange. Al-
ways heard that if there was a drawback to attractiveness of
Ireland, it was the too constant rain. Certainly it has been a dry
summer with us. Water famine at Elast End and the like.
Probably average not yet made up at Dublin. However it be,
instead of crossing Channel to Ireland, we steer up Scotch coast
to Lamlash Bay. A fresh injustice to Ireland.
After luncheon, went, ashore. Some question whether we
should be able to land. Rumour current that the pier is locked
up on Sundays. Advanced cautiously. Reconnoitred. Not a
soul in sight. Landed on pier. At gate a board proclaimed that
a fee of two-pence is levied on every passenger. Feel for
our coppers. A ghostly silence reigns over hut whence collector
might be expected to spring. Gate open; we walk through un-
taxed. Hope the collector not regarding us from window of one
of the houses near. Pitiful to think of his emotions on seeing
bang go at least twenty twopences uncollected.
Turning to the left, we come on a long street, facing the turf-
edged sea. This is Lamlash, a congeries of lodging-houses, none
more than a story high. The lodgers are mostly on the cold
fround, sitting on chairs or benches in front of their apartments,
hey don't talk, much less "whustle." The nearest approach to
carnality is the possession of a spy-glass. Coming from Glas-
gow, and further inland, this gives the final touch of nautical
circumstance to the too brief holiday. From time to time one
pute up his spy-glass, slowly surveys scene in the bay, and
solemnly brings the glass back to his knee. They must have seen
it all before through many days. Nevertheless, at brief intervals
they sweep the horizon, always beginning at t ho same place, and
with slow motion leaving off as before.
"I think," said SA UK, involuntarily dropping his voice to a
whisper, "they 're looking out for Monday, when they can talk
to each other again, bustle around, bathe, or even catch mussels."
A fair scene of Sabbath peace, broken only by the lapping of
the waves among the sea-weed on the beach. Meeting an elderly
gentleman, looking uncomfortable in an aggressively square-
built suit of rusty black, I ventured to expatiate on the beauty
of the scene. The patriot Scot evidently pleased at the
artless enthusiasm of a mere Southron. He hadn't a spy-glass
with him, having evidently just come out of church. But he

It's a framework of perforated pipes, within which you stand,
turn a wheel-handle, and water, hot or cold, dashes forth in fine
thick rain. SARK had heard that the thing to do is to turn on
both handles, modifying the heat according to taste. He began
with that labelled "hot water."
It was surprisingly hot. SARK dashed at the handle; gave it
another screw, meaning to turn the water off. In excitement
of moment, blinded with the dashing spray, agonised by the nearly
boiling water, he turned it wrong way. The water played upon
him with redoubled force and heat.
SAHK'S observations were, I am told, heard at some distance.
"Why didn't you step out of the enclosure?" I asked.
"You get in, and see what you Ml do," he replied, its par-
boiled condition lending an almost evil glare to the countenance

unanimous as compared with this Commission. The result is un-
paralleled amongst Blue Books.
First of all eleven of the thirteen commissioners agree
to a final joint report, which they sign. Item: This
done, five of them, the Chairman, Mr. REDMOND, Mr.
MARTIN, Mr. HUNTBR, and Mr. WOLFF presents a report on
their own account. Item: Lord FARRER, Lord WELBY, and Mr.
CURRIE hand in iheir report. Item: Lord WBLBY drafts a memo-
randum declaring wherein he disagrees from Lord FARRER and Mr.
CTTRRIE, whose report he has signed. Item: Mr. SEXTON, Mr.
BLAKE, and Mr. SLATTERY sign a fourth report. Item.: Mr.
BLAKE sets forth, at considerable length, points of difference he
holds with Mr. SÏXTON and Mr. SLATTKRY, whose report
carries his signature. Item: Sir DAVID BARBOUB has a
report that no one else will sign, even with the privi-
lege of supplementing it by a memorandum showing how it
is, in the main, hopelessly wrong. Item: Sir THOMAS SUTHER-
LAND, not to be outdone, presents a masterly report demonstra-
ting the unfairness and the impracticability of everything but his
own particular plan.
Am glad to have dropped anchor off Tilbury. A delightful
voyage, a noble ship, a princely host, charming company. But
after studying the Report of the Royal Commission on the
Financial Relations between Great Britain and Ireland one has
a strange, strong hankering for terra firma.
WAIST NOT WASTE NOT.
(Paradoxical but Important.)
"IN Paris the 'wasp' waist is off," they declare.
This is excellent news to the wholesome and tasteful.
Adopt a full waist if your health you would spare,
It is the spare waist that is wasteful!

For a waist that is only a grace—in a wasp!

WHEN the manager asked me in this matter-of-fact way if he
should show me one or two heroines, I was naturally somewhat
taken aback. My reply was cautious. "Is it quite safe P" I
asked.
"Oh, perfectly. You see, we keep them low in the matter of

about once every two months. Their ordinary food while they

they can't get very fierce on that. They all know me. I make

which we were standing, and called out "HÏBMIONE, ROSAMUND,"
whereupon, to my intense surprise, two fully-grown females
issued forth. They immediately began to dance round the
manager with the most lively demonstrations of affection, patted
his head, stroked his cheeks, and kissed his hands. "Down,

"you are simply covering me with scent. This," he continued,

"Now then, look alive with the haggis," "send along the hoots-
toots, and be sharp with them," " Elders for three and discourse
for two," "Six braw Heelanders in order." Such were some of
the curious phrases that were hurtling about. I wag introduced
to the head clerk. "A very interesting man," whispered the
manager; "was a Free Kirk Minister once, and used to preach
wonderfully, but had to give it up owing to nerves. He 's really
most useful to us, most useful; has a thorough knowledge of all
the dialects, and for salmon-rivers and golf-links I would back
him against any one you could name." I bowed respectfully to
the ex-minister, and engaged him in conversation for a few
moments. I regret to say, however, that I failed to grasp the
meaning of his remarks. When he asked me to "Come ¡uva'
ben," I murmured something to the effect that my name was
not BENJAMIN, and as the situation seemed to bo getting
strained, I was glad when the manager took me away.
\Vn next went upstairs into another large room. "This
is one of our show-rooms," explained the manager; "please be
very careful where you step. I 'm afraid the place isn't as tidy
as it ought to be. We're simply littered with French Kings
and Cardinals just now. Everybody wants them, and as they 're
a very bloodthirsty lot their keep comes rather expensive. Those
are French girls, daughters of Counts or Sieurs, and as brave and
patient and loving as we can make them. We provide them all
with our own patent action for battlement-climbing and hanging
over rocky ramparts by ropes while the bullets whistle round
them. It's an ingenious toy. Of course we require a gallant
young knight or two to make it work thoroughly. The gallant
young knights are generally fools, but the public sot-ins to like
them. Ah, that's our case of cheap murders. Pretty things,
aren't they P"
I ASKED the manager if there was much doing in poetry just at
present. "Not very much," he replied; "poetry's a bit off.
\Ve used to sell quite a number of ballades and things, and I 've
seen as many as a dozen minore in here at one time buying
rhymes and stanzas and other brittle goods; but that was some
years ago. Somebody or other had died, a Laureate, or some-
thing of that sort, and there was a good deal of competition for
the place. We sold a great number of our shilling packets of
rhymes. But on the whole it 's not a particularly paying busi-
ness, and we 're thinking of giving it up altogeter. We 've had
an offer from Vigo Street to take it over as a going concern, and
I 've advised our directors to close with it. Ah, here 's something
you '11 like. It's an idea of my own, and one of the best things
we do." The manager pointed to a polished mahogany case on
the floor. "Just look at the finish of that," he said; "you can't
approach it anywhere else. Why, the case itself is well worth
the money we charge for it, let alone the contents. It's our
guinea box of allsorts"—he began ticking them off on his fingers—
''containing one dozen best interviews, two hundred high-class
quotations, specially selected, six sporting anecdotes, four de-
tectives, with our own inscrutable smile and a revolver apiece,

Satan, as used by Miss COKELI/I, sadness, patent-leather boote,
gentlemanly breeding, and odour of brimstone all complete,
twenty-five literary causeries, fifteen dialogue-stories, and an
assortment of East End slang. Oh, it's a magnificent bargain,
that 's what it is. Let me tempt you with it?"
To be brief, I was tempted and I succumbed. But up to the
present I have had no opportunity of making use of my remark-
able purchase. Still, it is certain to come in useful sooner or
later. I hope before long to pay another visit to my friend, the
manager of the Universal Literary Supply Company, Limited.

THE MANNERS OF OLDER PEOPLE.
(Communications from some of the Children.)
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—I am a little girl, aged ten, and live with
my uncle and aunt, because my papa and mamma are on duty
in India. My aunt, who isn't my real aunt, goes to church three
times every Sunday, but you should just see her on week days.
If I try to sing when the dear old barrel-organ comee into the
street, she boxes my ears, and says, "That will teach you to
remember the time of day." She always sends me to bed early,
and then she has the "gurgles "—so I heard her describe her
complaint to MARTHA, the parlour-maid. I don't quite know
what this disease is, but it is awfully loud. Uncle, who comes
home very early in the morning, is generally afflicted with the
"stumbles," and has played sad havoc with our stair-carpete.
He says his physician states that the only cure for his com-
plaint is whiskey, and he strictly follows the doctor's advice. I
am not happy because Aunt and Uncle are always "storming"
at one another. Then I am frightened, and MABTHA gets under
the kitchen table, and JANE, the cook, locks herself up in the
larder. I wish you could make my elders behave better. My
governess says that Time will set all things right. I don't quite
know what she means. Perhaps you will send Time to your
little friend, ERMTNTRUDB EARWAKER.
Raspberry Mount, Lincolnshire, September 12, 1896.
DEAR SIR,—What is the matter with the old folks? They are
never at home. I remember when I was about five that I used
to come down to dessert every night. Now they have no dinners
at home. Pa and Ma are always feeding at the best West End
restaurants, and all I have to keep me company is "Shah," the
Persian pussy. I am an up-to-date girl, and cannot stand this
state of affairs much longer. Even the cat won't go away, or
else this mouse would play. Yours truly,
Isle of Man Chambers, W. GRISELDA THOROVOHPIN.
SIR,—I am at Rodwell School during the best part of the year,
and I wish I were there now. My people have lugged me on to
the continent to satisfy their own selfishness. I like cricket and
lawn tennis, but at this beastly hole there is neither one nor the
other. I can't get a decent glass of beer, and the noise of the
bands is enough to send a fellow crazy. But Father and Mother
seem to enjoy themselves. They are always going to the Kursaal
and "planking their ready" (you see I know a thing or two)
on this or that colour, or some particular number of which
Mother has dreamt. I don't call it fair to me, for they never
give me a chance. I'd rather be playing "shove-halfpenny"
with JAMES, our footman, though he has always cleaned me out

jrospects will be hopelessly blighted unless I can do away with
my social surroundings. There is a cobbler up our court, who
not only greets me with impertinent familiarity, but also dis-

No. II.—MISS JOANNA.
SOME blossoms ope to fade away
At the first touch of winter's blasting,
But while her fellow-flowers decay
Our Miss JOANNA 's everlasting:
For though a score of years and more
Have glided since she first came out, Sir,
She blooms to-day as young and gay
Ая when she saw her maiden rout, Sir.
She is our star. A tone, an air
Of breeding o'er the town she scatters,
Nor is there one so bold that dare
Dispute her sway in social matters.
Happy whom she with favour names!
Happy the house where she is seen, bir 1
Has she not curtseyed at St. James,
And been presented to the QUEEN, bir r
Though here we seldom get the chance,
We love a little dissipation,
And if we haply have a dance
Or soiree, great our jubilation.
Then songs are sung, and flings are flung,
And reels are reeled with merry pranc-
ing,
And no one but the very young
Believes himself too old for dancing.
There Miss JOANNA will be seen—
Without her 'twere no dance at
S'r—
With stately step and gracious mien.
And all prepared to lead the ball, bir:
A coy wee rosebud in her hair.
A simple fleck of modest yellow,
And resting on her bosom fair,
In innocent repose, its fellow.
Ah I Happy he to whom the Fates
Entrust so rare, so chaste a burden!
Aye, blessed beyond all potentates
To whom they grant so rich a guerdon I
What though she wear another's hair?
What though her blushes will not go,
Sir?
Who once has clasped that form so fair,
Is stamped forever comme il faut, Sir.
Or if sweet music while the night,
Then Miss JOANNA kindly favours:
With carefully subdued delight
We listen while she gently quavers.
She warbles " Orpheus with his Ly-oot,"
With wondrous twist and turn and
twiddle,
Now fainter than the softest flute,
Now pyrotechnic as a fiddle.
And when her classic song is done,
At our request, she, with a smile, Sir,
Agrees to give her other one,
That sweet old air, "Within a mik,
Sir,
And when in gay and girlish way
She coyly trills, "I canna, canna,
Why then we know, where'er we go,
There 's none can sing like Miss JOANNA.

But the sea-serpent o'er which long we 'те wrangled,
You skinniest, most contemptible of cold corpusee?

You 're more like a big eel or monster worm,
With neither power to swallow, swamp, nor pizonl
You 're not a cuttle-fish, nor yet a seal,
A ledge of rocks, or a long ridge of coral!
Why your preposterous self should you reveal,
And spoil the penny-a-liner's yam—and moral—
By getting stranded on the Australian coast,
Giving yourself—and us—away completely?
How much you discount the sea-captain's boast,
And discumbobulate the old sailor sweetly I
But really you should have shown more respect
For us poor scribblers in the Silly Season.

And spoil Romance by listening to Reason

(Communications from some of the Children. )
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—I am a little girl, aged ten, and live with
my uncle and aunt, because my papa and mamma are on duty
in India. My aunt, who isn't my real aunt, goes to church three
times every Sunday, but you should just see her on week days.
If I try to sing when the dear old barrel-organ comes into the
street, she boxes my ears, and says, "That will teach you to
remember the time of day." She always sends me to bed early,
and then she has the "gurgles"—so I heard her describe her
complaint to MARTHA, the parlour-maid. I don't quite know
what this disease is, but it is awfully loud. Uncle, who comes
home very early in the morning, is generally afflicted with the
"stumbles," and has played sad havoc with our stair-carpets.
He says his physician states that the only cure for his com-
plaint is whiskey, and he strictly follows the doctor's advice. I
am not happy because Aunt and Uncle are always "storming"
at one another. Then I am frightened, and MARTHA gets under
the kitchen table, and .(ANE, the cook, locks herself up in the
larder. I wish you could make my elders behave better. My
governess says that Time will set all things right. I don't quite
know what she means. Perhaps you will send Time to your
little friend, ERMYNTRUDE E AR WAKER.
Raspberry Mount, Lincolnshire, September 12, 1896.
DEAR SIR,—What is the matter with the old folks? They are
never at home. I remember when I was about five that I used
to come down to dessert every night. Now they have no dinners
at home. Pa and Ma are always feeding at the best West End
restaurants, and all I have to keep me company is "Shah," the
Persian pussy. I am an up-to-date girl, and cannot stand this
state of affairs much longer. Even the cat won't go away, or
else this mouse would play. Yours truly,
Isle of Man Chambers, W. GRISELDA THOROUGHPIN.
SIR,—I am at Rodwell School during the best part of the year,
and I wish I were there now. My people have lugged me on to
the continent to satisfy their own selfishness. I like cricket and
lawn tennis, but at this beastly hole there is neither one nor the
other. I can't get a decent glass of beer, and the noise of the
bands is enough to send a fellow crazy. But Father and Mother
seem to enjoy themselves. They are always going to the Kursaal
and "planking their ready" (you see I know a thing or two)
on this or that colour, or some particular number of which
Mother has dreamt. I don't call it fair to me, for they never
give me a chance. I'd rather be playing "shove-halfpenny"

The Dull Weather Gentleman. "NICE GIRL THAT NEXT DOOR—BUT
DREADFULLY SHY! ALWAYS POPS IN WHEN I COMB OUT."
"THE SAILORMAN'S MENOO."
(To a Shipovmer. By a Shell-back.)
IT 's mighty fine, yer talkin', but you never done no tripe
In the bloomin' leaky foc'sle of yer leaky, rotten ships;
And though you gulls the public with a sham Menoo for us,
It isn't printed lies as makes provisions worth a cuss;
And even silly emigrants will tell you straight and true
That the test of grub is grubbin', not the advertised Menoo.
I 'm talkin' now, not beggin' for a chance to starve and work,
In an undermanned old tanker with a skipper like a Turk;
With a cook as lurnt 'is cookm' when 'e 'ad to cook or beg,
Or go into an 'orspital to nurse a cranky leg;
And what I says I means it, and my words is plain and true,
Which is more than any sailorman will say for yer Menoo.
I '11 allow that in the look of it, the print of it I mean,
That all you say is sarved to us; but is it good or clean?
And wot 's wet 'ash, or porridge, or any other stuff,
When at the very best of it there 's 'ardly 'arf enough?
Not even with the cockroaches that 's given with the stew,
Though'I notice they nor maggots wasn't down in yer Menoo.
There 's the tea and corfee talked of, but folks ashore ain't told
That the swine as bought it for you winked 'is eye at them as sold.
For sailormen's best Mocha was never further 'East
Than a bloomin' Essex bean-field; and the tea ain't tea—at least
It 's on'y "finest sweepin's" from the docks, and wot a brew
It makes when sarved in buckets to drink to yer Menoo I
The pork and beef on paper, or a tin dish, makes a show,
But you'd want yer front teeth sharpened if you tackled it,
my bo'!
For the beef is still the ancient 'orse wot worked on Portland
Pier,
And the pork is rotten reaaty, that was inwoiced twice too dear
If they charged you 'arf a thick 'un for the whack you gives the
crew,
With the pickles and the butter set out fine in yer Menoo.
I 'd like to take you jossers, as thinks as sailormen
For when yer 'amis was achin' with sea cute to the bone,
And-the Baltic talked north-easters, you'd be alterin' of yer tone,
And mightn't think wot's wrote in print is necessary true,
And per"ape when you was safe agen you 'd alter our Menoo.
L'ILE DE WIGHT. .
DEAR MiSTEn,—The other day I go with my friend to a
"croquetparty." I love much the sport, the tennis, the bicy-
clette, but I know not to play the croquet. All of same, I go
there. There is the hostess, a lady very gracious, but
very solemn, of a in good point—embonpoint, how say you ?—
very remarkable. I shall name her Missis "JONES." There is a
clergyman. Ah, the brave little clergyman! Of a vivacity, of
of a verve во charming, almost young. He is not young; he
has, perhaps, sixty years, but he runs, he skips, he is the sole—
le seul—who has the air of to amuse himself. There fa a mili-
taire—a military—very ferocious, the visage red, the moustache
grey, the eyebrows very thick. There is a doctor of the army in
retreat. And there is some ladies.
Eh well, my friend presents me to Missis JONES. I say to her,
"He makes very fine to-day." You see, Mister Punch, I know
the mode of your country, I commence in speaking of the fine
time. But she is distraite—distracted—and she responds not,
but she presents me to the clergyman, to the military and to the
doctor in retreat. Then we drink the tea, the "fiveoclok" in
the salon. Ah, how it is gay 1 By hazard I seat myself between
the military and the doctor. All .the two have been at the
Indias. You know that in your Island of Wight all the world is
military. Partout—by all—there is some generals, some
colonels, some majors, some captains, and they are all in retreat,
and they speak alldays—toujours—of the India and of the sport.
Me I know not the India. Naturally my two neighbours
talk of the India, of the serpents, of the sport, of the tigers.
The military has much studied the serpents, and he speaks of
them, and of the savage beasts, with a frown of the eyebrows
worthy of Tartarin. C'est étonnamment gai — astoniehly gay.
And all the time I regard at the other side of the salon the
respectable curate—le respectable curé. His friends call him
ficaire, but he has not of all the air of a vicaire. He is not
enough young, he is not enough thin; he is all to fact old good
man—tout-à-fait vieux bonhomme, how say you? Le voità.—see
there him—speaking to the ladies, so gay, so amiable, so ani-
mated. I love to see him. The croquetparty suits well to the
clergy, above all to those who are a little aged. Me who am
lay and young I love it not.
In fine we со to the garden. Then I play the croquet. Me,
AUGUSTE, I play! Missis JONES invites me. I say that I regret
infinitely that I know not to play. She says me that it is easy.
I finish by to yield. I play with her. The military, who is
major, and one of the ladies are our adversaries.
In effect, Missis JONES plays very well, and the other lady
also. The major т)1яув not well, but he plays very severely, and
he has the air of the president of я сопяеП de guerre—that which
you call a "court-martial "—speaking to the accused. It seems
to me as if I were the accused, and I am all timid when he frowns
the eyebrows so terribly. For me I play not of all of all—du
tout du tout. Missis JONES aids me with good counsels, but
she has the air of a schoolmistress scolding a little boy, and
she says me, "Now hit my ball, if you can: "and she regards me
severely, and the major regards me severely, so that when I
essay to hit my ball to,me, I hit the turf, and then I hit the too
of mv ball, and she goes I know not where, all far from the ball
of Missis JONES. Then this lady says, "That is not so bad."
And one other time when I plav to wrong and to traverse—
à tort et à trarert, how say you?—she says me, "That will do
pretty well." This irony renders me more unskilful. How-
ever, Misses JONES "croquets" my ball, she goes through the
boons, she hits the stick, and, my faith, she arrives the first!
The major essays long time to hit one of the sticks, but he
can not. Each time that he misses, his figure-—so figure—be-
comes more red, and the eyes gleam, and he has the air of to
condemn the accused to be shot, nnd I think to all the words
he would say if these ladies were not there. In fine I pity him,
for to what good would a military say "Bother"? That is not
enough, that is not nothing, that exclamation there, which is
permitted in your country.
In fine we finish, and the major parts as soon as possible, with-
out any doubt for to say at him—chez lui—all that which he has
not said. Me also I part, but before to go I give a ehokehands to
Missis JONES, and I say to her, "Enchanted," and "A game of
the most agreeables," and "Thousand thanks, dear Missis," and
Is a grumblin' lot of skulkers, just one trip and 'orne agen;
all the other phrases of the politeness. Agree, Ac., Arca STR.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MANNERS AND CUSTOMS TOR THE YOUNG.
(By a fast Master of the Ceremonia. )
So much has been written recently of the faulty deportment of
our children that it may be well to formulate a few simple
rules for the guidance of those of them who would wish to pass
for boys and girls of elegance and bon ton. Accordingly, I jot
down a suggestion or two for their consideration in this con-
nection.
Invariably be courteous to visitors to your parents' house. If
they bring hats and umbrellas, or parasols, immediately carry
them away. That the articles may be in safe keeping entrust
them to the care of the nearest pledge-taker, who will give you a
card and some money as a guarantee of good faith, but, as they
say in the newspapers, not necessarily for publication.
Booby traps are entirely out of fashion, so if you wish to

amuse your friends within your father's mansion, spread pebbles
between their sheet« and blankets, and cover their pillows
with pepper.
Nothing is pleasanter to a humorist than a tribute of laughter.
Remembering this when a young lady or gentleman, rather proud
of her or his voice, attempts to sing a sentimental song, indulge
in fits of uproarious merriment.
The old always value the attentions of the young. So when
you see an octogenarian on the point of seating himself comfort-
ably in an arm-chair, be careful to retreat the article of furni-
ture in question a few inches, that the veteran may come unex-
pected to the ground. This will arouse the elderly gentleman,
and induce him to address you with an earnestness entirely
beyond his years.
As it is not now considered good form to ask for a tip, you had
better take what you want from the rich when their attention is
fixed on some object other than their purses.
Although it is distinctly rude to smash the hats left by visitors
in the hall, there is no particular harm in filling the pockets of
the overcoats of the same owners with candle ends, marmalade,
and (when procurable) cold pea-soup.
Personal cleanliness is of the utmost importance in elegant
society, so never neglect to wash your hands at least once a week,
and brush your hair even more frequently.
It is extremely rude to interrupt a senior when he is telling an
anecdote to an interested audience of his equals. So should you
particularly wish to communicate with him without stopping the
flow of his conversation, you should tap him smartly on the
head with a soup ladle.
Finally, your first duty is to your father and mother. Bearing
this in mind, should you obtain, through intimidation or some
other equally effectual means, a sum of money from your friends,
relatives and acquaintances, you should be sure to hand over an
appropriate percentage of your earnings to your parente.

Mamma. To-morrow will be daddy's birthday.

Then, I s'pose, all the shops will be closed, mummy, and we

THE TERRORISM OF TOUTS.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—I quite agree with the great NAPOLEON
in his statement that we are a nation of shop-keepers, but I do
wish that we could sometimes repress our commercial instincts.
I am in business myself, and know what competition means, but
I confess that when I take my holiday at the seaside I do not
like to be made a sort of prize in a handicap of tradesmen. This
year I have hired a villa at that delightful watering-place, Silver-
sands, but I almost wish that I had never done so. Why? you
will naturally inquire. Well, Sir, long before I left London
with my family—I suppose I have to thank the local house-
agent for this—I was bombarded with letters from the grocers,
butchers, bakers, milkmen, wine merchants, and oilshop keepers
of Sil Versands, imploring my esteemed custom. Some of them
even sent samples of their wares with delicately-worded missives,
begging me to accept these tokens of gratitude for favours to
come. Two or three took the trouble and expense of travelling
to London to interview me personally, and one of them being
mistaken, by my wife, while I was out, for a distant cousin of
the same name, was actually bidden to dinner. Another was
seen by my eldest girl making love to our cook in the area, and
a third, I have since discovered, captured GHEENSEAL, the butler,
and treated him to a 'dinner at the Criterion, and a stall at the
play afterwards. But all this skirmishing was nothing to the
pitched battle which ensued on our leaving town to take up our
new quarters. I dare say, Sir, you are aware that the through
carriages from London to Silversands are shunted at Picklock
Junction, some twenty miles distant from the coast. I had en-
gaged a saloon carriage for ourselves, and of course our privacy
was respected on the way down, but at Picklock two gentleman-
like young fellows came to the door and politely asked, as the
train was very full, if I would allow them to come in. Being no
churl I at once said "Yes, by all means." They were ready
conversationalists, and begun upon such topics as the South
African War and the length of the Queen's reign.
Presently, however, they turned the current of talk on to
the state of trade, a matter which of course interested me
greatly. They warmed to the subject, and observed that even
at Silversands the visitor had to beware of unscrupulous and
designing persons, who would foist the most inferior goods on
him at most exorbitant prices. "Knowing, therefore," said
the elder of the two, "that you have taken Cockleshell Cottage
for the season, we have ventured to bring you a list of tradesmen
on whom you may implicitly rely." With that he handed me a
paper as long as a lawyer's bill. "And who are you, gentle-
men?" I inquired. "We are," replied the spokesman, "the
president and secretary of the Silversands Protection Society,
and we ask you not to forget to place yourself in our hands."
The train was just stopping for tickets at Mudlook, so with the
most courteous bows they disappeared, leaving us in a state of
extreme surprise. But on arrival at Silversands Station we
were still more astonished, being literally taken prisoners. Half
a dozen stalwarts formed a ring round me, and, with stage chorus
effect, forced price lists into my pockets; as талу more got
hold of my wife, and implored her patronage, my children were
held at ransom, while my servants were beleaguered by a score or
more of suppliants. The railway porters looked on and grinned.
No doubt they were accustomed to similar scenes.
It was quite half an hour before we could tear ourselves
from their clutches, and even then some of the nimble-
footed knaves pursued our flys, keeping up a fire of circular
ammunition. "Thank goodness!" I cried, fervently, as the
vehicles stopped at the gate of Cockleshell Cottage. "We have
escaped!" Scarcely were the words out of my mouth, when two
determined individuals jumped out from behind a laurestinus
hedge, nearly frightening my wife into a fit, a third broke
ambush from a rose clump, another was lurking behind the
honey-suckle of the verandah, four blocked the front door, and
six the back entrance, while two had managed, somehow or
another, to get into the kitchen. All of them, like playgoing
deadheads, clamoured for "orders." The confusion was dread-
ful, the din appalling, and the luggage could scarcely be brought
into the house. I laagered my family in the dining-room, and,
with the aid of GBEENSBAL, the footman and the groom managed,
after severe fighting, to clear the premises, but not before the
hall and kitchen floors were littered "with paper enough," as
the cook remarked, "to light the fires for weeks to come." For
ten days the attacks were renewed, to no purpose. I get all
my stores and provisions from London, and have even bought a
cow. I am not a mean fellow, only a resentful citiaen not popu-
lar in Silversands, but your obedient servant,
THOMAS THREADNEEDLE.

MY study fire is now alight—
The first time since the Spring—
It seems to make the scene more bright,
The kettle e'en must sing;
And gazing on this mass of coal
I feel old merriment of soul.
There in that cinder I can trace
The lines of him who drest
So scrupulously up to grace
That he forgot his vest,
And perished with a figure trim,
Mid-winter frosts, they finished him.
And there again that ardent flame
Reminds me of the heart
That you declared was still the same
Until we had to part.
You wrote that you would "soon be

But wedded someone else instead.
A lazy lump that will not burn

A rolling stone, too prone to turn,

It is not coal, but only slate.
Yet still I 'm glad, e'en when I note
That coffin in the fire,
For Fate hath surely someone smote
Who dared to rouse my ire.
A wicked thought! Well, let him die!
The world is wicked, so am I.

Of those who Southward fly
Where pigmy palms their span-leaves

Reproachful to the sky,
Forgetful that they 're grown to show
Blaze on, good coals, within the grate,
Let harmony be seen I
You only can regenerate
The thoughts of what have been.

A NEW WOMAN is like to—but stay!
What New Woman is like, who can say?
There is no living with or without one!
She 's just like a fly
To the ear, to the eye,
Buzz, buzz, always buzzing about one!
Untender, unkind,
She is like, to my mind,
(Woman was not so ante, I remember,)
She's like to—О dear!
She 's as bad, far or near,
As a pea-soupy fog in November!
If she chaff, and she chat,
Write, bike, and all that,
And with "bags" and male manners she
meet me,
She 's like a queer dish,
That cries—like Cockaigne pigs—come eat
me!
But she '11 shock you, and vex you,
Disgust and perplex you.
Immodestly ranging,
Continually changing,
What then do you think she is like?
Like a man P Like a shock?
On a wheel, with a frock
Only fit for a shrew on a " bike."
Her head 'e like the islands bards tell on,
Which flowers, fruits, and feathers all
dwell on
Her heart's like a hard lemon-ice,
As cold and as acid—so nice!
In truth she's to me
Like an east wind at sea,
That's good and that's pleasant to no
man;
Like a chill, like a pill,
Like a flail for the male,
Missing link (in a kink)
Betwixt a fast girl and a slow man!
Like a bower void of flower,
Content without scent
Like a shrike on a bike,
Like a fly in one's eye,

POETRY TOR POLITICAL CHILDREN.
(A droll of bit Doggerel brought up to Diite.)
THERE was a clever earl, who had a twirly curl,
Which hung down the middle of his forehead,
And some thought his policy was very, very good,
And some thought his policy was horrid.
He "etood on his head" on the hustings, he once said,
And nobody his high career could hinder;
Though some squealed and some squalled, and some yelled and
some bawled,
And shied their little stones agin his winder.
But alas! (as BALFOUR said,) that clever earl is.dead,
And his foes have been—comparatively—silent.
But now they 're popping up, every tyke, and cur, and pup,
And a-pitching into him extremely vilent.
And Punch, who of old made considerably bold
To criticise that earl, whilst he was living,
Thinks it very far from right to keep up mere sputtery spite,
When the time has come for praising and forgiving.
He 's aweary of the noise of those "little vulgar boys,"
Each brain like an empty attic,
Who against Earl BEAKY blare, and he '11 catch them unaware,
And spank them—most emphatic I
RESTORATION OF KING CYMBELINE.
HEARTILY, nay uproariously, were welcomed Mise ELLEN
TERRY and Sir HENRY IHVINO (announced in the bills as
"HENRY IRVING" tout^timpte without "Mr." or "Sir") when,
as Imogen and lachimo respectively, they walked on to the
Lyceum stage, September 22, memorable for the first repre-
sentation at this theatre of a certain Shakspearian play
called Cymbdine. "Cymbdine condensed," of course, was the
mixture presented most suited to the public taste, as "Cymbeline
entire" would have been too much for the friendliest audience.
The talkative lords and gentlemen of the old play were cut out
or cut down, and for those characters who survived the opera-
tion, it sufficed that they " looked the parts " to admiration. Miss
ELLEN TERRY was simply charming as Imogen; perfectly natural,
which is the same as saying "genuinely artistic." So
thoroughly did she identify herself with the modest, virtuous,

retiring-to-bed-early Imogen, that, when roused from her sleep
by the plaudits of the audience, after the Bed-room Scene,
when from her arm wicked lachimo has stolen her bracelet,
Miss ELLEN shyly refused to face the house, but hid her face
with her hands as, in her snow-white robe de nuit, she stood
by the friendly bedpost as if shrinking from the boldly-expressed
admiration of a thousand lachimos in the stalls, boxes, and
gallery. Her every action was in itself quit« in keeping with
the romantic ideal of the poetic dramatist. And HENRY

on the stage, HENRY IRVING went. It was his own private
box, kept by Mr. LOVEDAY and Mr. BRAM STOKER solely and
only for Sir HENRY'S use: and made to hold one, not more,
and that not quite comfortably.
What did Jacki do with his legs? If he doubled himself up,
then out of that box should have come two lachimos, or
lachimi! If ever actor "doubled a part" that actor was
HENRY IRVING, as Jackimo, when he "doubled himself" (so
he did in the Corsican Brothers and the Courier of Lyons) up,
and lay concealed in his own chest!! Marvellous legs! Won-

Then his fight with brave Frank 1'osthumus Cooper, who
floored but spared him! Again, what more wonderful than the
ipparently sudden conversion of lachimo, when he confesses
»verything, makes amends, and is so profoundly contrite as to
excite our pity, and awaken in all the hope that he will for the
remainder of his life be a good boy, never indulge in betting,
md, it may be, marry and live happy, but henpecked, ever
ifterwards.
Mr. FRED ROBINSON as hearty, rough-and-ready Bdarius, a
"banished lord," calling himself Morgan" (which he was per-
fectly at liberty to do), and his two "supposed" sons, Mr. B.
WEBSTER and Mr. GORDON CRAIG, who were not wise enough to
know their own father, were, all three, immediately on
the best terms with the audience, who recognised Hill Arius
as an old friend and stager in spite of all his disguise. There
is a grand stage-fight, so realistic that had it not been for the
chiefs, Bdarius & Co. appearing triumphantly at the back, in
a well-arranged tableau, it would have been difficult for an un-
military audience to decide which party was victorious.
Miss GENEVIEVE WARD, as the wicked Lady Macbethlike
queen, and Mr. NORMAN FORBES, as her brainless, conceited,
quarrelsome son Cloten, were both uncommonly good in two
not uncommonly good parts.
The play is in five acte, Ret to appropriate music by Mr.
HAMILTON CLARKE, while the scenery, by Messrs. HAWES
CRAVEN and HARKER, shows some such perfectly perspectived
interiore as the artists themselves will find it difficult to excel. In
the bill it is announced by the manager, rather "dropping into

satisfied. It is no doubt due to the eminent Royal Acade-
mician's accuracy that the deer-hounds of the first century, in
which the play is cast, when brought on by Ouiderius, are
carefully muzzled in order to comply with the police regulations
of the present year of grace. The forethought was admirable.
How awkward if, in Scene 1, Act IV., a constable, say A.I.
from Bow Street, close at hand, should have stepped on the
stage and taken both dogs into custody! Next day we should
have read how Bdarius & Co. had been let off with a small fine
in consequence of its being their first offence. However, the
muzzles were there, and the contretemps avoided.
Cymbdine must be in for a run of good luck, thoroughly
deserved by Sir HENRY, and by all concerned with him, in this
his latest Shakspearinn revival.

BRIGHTON.
À Monsieur Punch.
Ркли MISTER,—At the fine of my little voyage in England I
arrest myself here. One has often spoken me of Brighton, the
english Nice, the town of sunshine. Therefore, in quitting the
Island of Wight, I make a little détour, and I visit Brighton
in road from Portsmout to London. After to have voyaged
in a train astonishly slow, I arrive to Brighton the evening, 1
go direct to the hotel, I dine about the nine of clock, I smoke
a cigar, and I couch myself. My bedroom gives on the garden,
and is very tranquil.
The morning I get myself up of good hour, and I go out to
respire the air from the sea. It seems to me that he makes
some wind, which I had not remarked in my room so well
sheltered, and I see the paving is wetted. I open my um-
brella, and I descend from the perron. Oh, la, la! At that
instant there I encounter a wind, a tempest—ah but, a veri-
table cyclone !—my hat flies himself away, my mackintosch cape
of Inverness raises herself all around of my head, I am thrown
against the balustrade of the hotel, and I see not where I am.
I hold strongly my umbrella, for an instant he struggles
violently, and then the frame and the silk leap into the air,
emportés—how say you?—by the wind, and I hold but the
stick. As soon as possible I re-enter, and then I find all that
so amusing that I laugh—nom d'une pipe, je me pâme de rire !—
and the spectators laugh also, and we are all very gay. Better
worth to laugh than to weep. But all of same I lose a good
umbrella. As to the hat, a brave coacher, of what you call a
"fly." entraps him—attraper, how say you? But he is so
much hurt that he resembles to the old hat of the coacher him-
self, and I give him to this last, with a piece of six pennys in
addition.
This arrives a certain Saturday. Figure to yourself, Mister
Punch, that he rains without cease all the day and all the
night, and still all the sunday until the evening! And
not only some rain, but some wind—a tempest, a hurri-
cane, a cyclone I After my little promenade of the morning,
when I lose my umbrella, I go not out the Saturday. From the
windows of the coffee-room and of the tea-room I regard the
sea, extremely agitated, the horizon veiled by sombre and
heavy clouds, the sky entirely grey. I see also the promenade,
deserted, of grey asphalte, wet and shining, and the jetée, the
"Ouestpir," also deserted. She is not so ugly as the jetée of
Nice, but she is enough ugly all of same.
Eh well, the sunday he falls still of the rain! C'est assom-
mant/ And one has said me that the sunday is less sad at
Brighton than in the other parts of your country. Triste!
Ah, mon Vieu! In fine, after the lunch, I am resolved to see
the town. I go to see the boulevards, the gardens, the palace
of the King GKORGK, and I make to come a "fly." Ciel, quelle
voiture! She is entirely closed, like a carriage of a coni-oi
funèbre, a funereal convoy, and one sees nothing if one has not
the head penchée—how say you?—by the door. The coacher
conducts me all the long of the deserted promenade, where the
wind is terrible, and then we see the palace. Oh, la, la I Un
palais de carton! Un décor d'opéra-bouffe! A decoration of
buffoon opera. The sole thing amusing in all the town so sad!
After this we traverse some miserable little streets, of houses
so ugly and so mesquines—how say you?—that I arrest the
coacher and I say him, "Go to the boulevards, the grand and
large streets." He responds there is not of them. Il n'y en
a pas? What says he after? "In Hove." Qu'est-ce que c'est
que ça? Ah, une autre ville! And we traverse again more of
miserable streets—my faith, so ugly !—until I arrest him of
new and demand, "Where, then, is this Hove?" "Here,
niaounsiah," says he. "But," I respond, "how that? It is
here Brighton." "No, maounsiah," says he, "thissirs Hove,
thatthairs Brighton, all one town." Then he continues, and
subitement we arrive to some streets so enormously wide that
in this rain one sees hardly from one side to the other. Some
ones are almost as wide as long. And they are all absolutely
deserted, and the grass begins to grow at the side.
A la bonne heure! C'est assez! I return in the "fly" to the
hotel by a tempest of wind and of rain, passing the " Ouestpir,"
where I read the affix, "Band now playing," but I go there not.
Cue faire? Nous verrons. Agree, Ac., AUGUSTE.
LOYAL AND TRUE.—"A propos of the recent downpours," quoth
Mr. JOHN BULL, "the only continuous rain of which I heartily
approve is the beneficent reign of good Queen VICTORIA."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

CONDENSED CONFIDENCE.
(For Ladies only.)
DEAREST ETHELINDA,—Since my escapade at Doncaster I
have been living what (were I a man) I should call the life of
a hermit at Scarborough. My cave, it is true, is situated in
the Royal Hotel, and possibly my pursuits are not those in
which an anchorite would indulge. Nevertheless, I feel that
I have taken the veil for (don't publish this in the local papers)
Lord ABTHUR RANTIPOLE, like some dere-
lict on the Sea of Time, has been recovered
by his wife! It happened in this way.
ARTHUR (forgive the all-too-happy fami-
liarity of nomenclature) and I were sitting
on the Spa promenade, listening to that
delicious band, which my dear friend
says always reminds him of METER LUTZ
and Little Doctor Faust, and the beach
was moaning in sympathetic concord (just
like a dog) with the music. In three words,
we were happy, and murmured soft noth-
ings, except when a beast of a man threw
the end of his cigar on my dress (then Lord
ARTHUR got up and talked of bloodshed);
but this incident was as nothing to what
followed. He had, under the influence, I
suppose, of a twentieth cigarette and a
fifth B. and S. (cela va sans dire), seized
my hand, and exclaimed, "My darling
KADJ; will you always be mine?" and
I, maiden like, was hanging matrimonial fire, when his hat
was, as ARTHUR at once described it, "bashed" over his brow
by a FEMALE. I was so surprised that I forgot to scream.
The Female exclaimed, "At last I 've found you, you villain!"
Lord ARTHUR, as usual cool 'as the proverbial cucumber, re-
plied, "And Where's the catch?" This seemed to anger her,
quite unnecessarily as I thought. She hissed—I should say
whispered," did that convey the diabolical tones of her utter-
ance—"I am in earnest this time. JONES is round the corner."
At these mysterious words Lord ARTHUR'S nonchalance vanished.
"All right," he said, "I '11 come with you." And then without
even raising his chapeau after his vieille noblesse style, he dis-
appeared, and I have not seen him since. Now, who is JONES?
The only explanation which I have received is the following
telegram sent from York : —
"Nobbled by wife. We shall meet again in heaven.—Актник."
This document, as you may suppose, is but small consolation
to me. Again I ask, who is JONES? Is he the FOUCHE of
some gross connubial plot, or the No. 1 of a dynamite conspiracy
to ruin my happiness? Papa, always unfeeling, asserts that
Lady ARTHUR and JONES have conspired to enable Lord ARTHUR
to make a hurried flight. Luckily he was not staying at our
hotel, for from several inquiries we gather that he has not
satisfied his landlord, and his grooms are, I know, in extremis.
Poor fellow! Had he never been foolish enough to bind the
sacred cord round his neck he and I might now have been one.
I feel the situation, ETHELINDA, perhaps more than you can
imagine, and am reading East Lynne for consolation. Mrs.
HENRY WOOD knew where and when the heart grew fondest.
II faut se distraire. I have just seen a charming yachting cos-
tume for winter wear, the novelty of the suit being that every
button is different, so that the Royal Yacht Squadron, the
London, the Thames, the Corinthian, the Southampton, and even
the merry Mudhook are represented on the discs. I shall order
a jacket, waistcoat and skirt ornamented after this descrip-
tion from "Messrs. directly I return to town. A good
dish for supper at Michaelmas is a Solan-goose, boiled with
grapes and capsicums, and, before serving, "doused" with Par-

P.P.S.—My poor ARTHUR! What is JONES? More next
week if I can discover where is JONES!

(Notes from a Society Paper of a future date.)
THE present season promises to be an exceptionally brilliant
one, owing, in large measure, to the number of distinguished
visitors from foreign countries who are honouring London by
their presence. It is true that in former years social gaieties
were much enhanced by the appearance of such notabilities as
the SHAHZADA and Li HUNG CHANG, but never until now have eo
many illustrious strangers visited us at the same time, to refresh
our jaded spirits by the quaint originality of their habits and
conversation.
DURING the past week Prince BOBO, the famous head of the
West Indian Scalpatzite tribe, has continued his tour of the
provinces, and has displayed a most intelligent interest in the
various manufacturing processes which he has witnessed. A very
humorous incident occurred at Messrs. HARDWARE'S factory,
during an exhibition of the work of smelting. The Prince, who
was in the best of spirits, suddenly seized the manager, who was
showing him round the works, and dropped him head foremost
into a huge caldron of molten iron, greatly to the delight of his
dusky suite. At Messrs. CANNON'S ordnance factory, one of the
staff ventured to assert to the Prince that a machine-gun was a
more effectual weapon than those in use among the Scalpatzit«
tribe, whereupon the Prince smilingly drew out a tomahawk,
and with marvellous dexterity promptly killed two of the factory
hands who happened to be standing near him.
THE eccentric manners of Lord PIM-
PAM-POM, that celebrated Oriental states-
man, continue to amuse London Society.
While in conversation with Lady PLANT A-
GENBT at the Archbishop's garden-party,
his keen eye discerned that the beauty of
her ladyship's coiffure was not due to Na-
ture alone, and, with a most impassive
countenance, he suddenly snatched away
her wig and placed it upon his own head.
At the same entertainment it is said that
he proposed to no less than eleven ladies,
seven of whom were already provided with
husbands. Lady PLANTAGENET he offered
to assign as a bride. to his secretary, re-
marking to her " that she was both too old
and too ugly to suit himself."

I HEAR that the chef de cuisine, of PiM-РАМ-Ром'в household is
in despair, owing to the fact that his lordship insists upon dining
upon roast fox daily. Great difficulty is experienced in obtaining
a sufficient supply of these animals, and the unfortunate cook is
not reassured Ъу his master's expressed intention to dine off
him if his favourite dish be not forthcoming.
KINO KOTCHAWAYO, with his African attendants, took great
pleasure in the ballet which he witnessed on Saturday night at
the Labrador Theatre of \7arieties. Indeed, he insisted upon its
being continued for five hours, and shot with his revolver two of
the performers who showed some symptoms of fatigue towards
the end of the third hour. He also took home with him the
big drum and some suits of stage armour, both of which are to be

THE true explanation of the regrettable fracas which occurred
in Piccadilly on Saturday night has not yet been given. Put
shortly, it is as follows : —about seven o'clock, a cab-horse,
which had been much overworked, suddenly fell down dead in the
road. The incident was perceived both by the Esquimaux at-
tached to Baron 11 urn's suite and by the African retinue of King
KOTCHAWAYO. With a simultaneous yell each party rushed upon
the fallen animal, with the purpose of claiming it as their booty
and conveying it to their kitchen, and the dispute at once became
animated. Fortunately, however, the amount of harm done was
trifling, a detachment of life-guards separated the combátante,
and the total number killed on each side did not much exceed
twenty.

A DUNCE was JIM, a dunce, indeed,
A perfect sample of the breed—
On this were all the world agreed,
Except his doting mother.
"My bairn ! my bonny bairn!" quoth she;
"It is his lungs are weak, ye see."
"Alack, it is his head," thought we,
And glanced at one another.
Her fear about his health was great,
And still the more that JIMMY ate,
The more she thought him delicate,
And more and more she gave him.
"He 's but a het-hoose flower!" she cried,
"Owre beautiful tae live," she sighed,
"But yet I '11 try, whate'er betide,
An' dae my best tae save him."
So tender was her care that lo!
The hot-house flower began to grow,
And soon was six-foot-two or so,
A healthy sixteen-stunner.
"N00, mark my words," she cried in glee,
"As sure as three times one is three,
My JIM a genius will be,
An' fill the warl' wi' wunner.
"What wad ye wish tae be, my sweet?
I doubt the farmin 's gey and weet:
The damp micht get intil y er feet,
An' then the cauld wad tak' ye.
The books is fine an' dry, but oo!
They 're sair upon a body's broo.
Eh. losh me, JIM, I hae 't the noo !—
An airtist we will mak' ye!"
The mother had a mind, the son
To all appearances had none;
Her will was law, and swiftly done;
JIM smilingly acceded.
She bought him brushes by the score,
With chalks and canvases galore,
And paints and palettes—far, far more
Than ever artist needed.
Well, JIM set to and daubed away
Some pictures for the B. S. A.,
And when it came to showing day
His friends were asked to view them.
We came in crowds the gems to see,
But which was cow and which was tree
No two of us could quite aeree,
And JIM himself scarce Knew them.
"H'm, yes," said we, "a pretty show;
But don't you think that JIM might go
And learn to draw? 'Twould help, you
know,
In painting cows and creatures."
"Na, na," his mother answered then,
"An airtist's no like ither men,
For eh. he 's born, no mad', ye ken—
My JIM shall hae пае teachers."
So JIM worked on as best he might
By artless Nature's simple light,
Untrammelled by a point of sight
Or any such vexation.
But, strange to say, none took the whim
Of buying any gems of him:
They stuck like barnacles to JIM
With grim determination.
A year or two went slowly past,
And JIM grew tired of it at last:
His weary brushes down he cast,
And took instead to drinking.
"Eh!" cried his mother, "let him be.
His mind is overstrained, ye see.
He '11 jist lie fallow for a wee.

Well, JIM lay fallow, and he found

No living man could match him.
It was a calling, it was plain,

Spinning talk's gossamer tissue,
Which talk anon unravels. Ins and Oute
Exchange wild eloquence in windy flouts,
And papers print the lot of it;
We word-devourers read and call it
grand,
All unaware we do not understand
The stale sophistic rot of it.
Clichés and cant, and clap-trap, catch-

At the command of every Grub Street

Sway us in Art and Letters.

PROVINCIAL SKETCHES.
No. III.-OUR GENIUS.
A DUNCE was JIM, a dunce, indeed,
A perfect sample of the breed—
On this were all the world agreed,
Except his doting mother.
"My bairn ! my bonny bairn!" quoth she;
"It is his lungs are weak, ye see."
"Alack, it is his head," thought we,
And glanced at one another.
Her fear about his health was great,
And stiU the more that JIMMY ate,
The more she thought him delicate,
And more and more she gave him.
"He 's but a het-hoose flower!" she cried,
"Owre beautiful tae live," she sighed,
"But yet I '11 try, whatfl'er betide,
An' dae my best tae save him."
So tender was her care that lo 1
The hot-house flower began to grow,
And soon was six-foot-two or so,
A healthy sixteen-stunner.
"N00, mark my words," she cried in glee,
"As sure as three times one is three,
My JIM a genius will be,
An' fill the warl' wi' wunner.
"What wad ye wish tae be, my sweet?
I doubt the farmin 'в gey and weet:
Thu damp micht get intil yer feet,
An' then the cauld wad tak' ye.
The books is fine an' dry, but oo!
They 're sair upon a body's broo.
Eh, losh me, JIM, I hae't the noo!—
An airtist we will mak' ye!"
The mother had a mind, the son
To all appearances had none;
Her will was law, and swiftly done;
JIM smilingly acceded.
She bought him brushes by the score,
With chalks and canvases galore,
And paints and palettes—far, far more
Than ever artist needed.
Well, JIM set to and daubed away
Some pictures for the R. S. A.,
And when it came to showing day
His friends were asked to view them.
We came in crowds the gems to see,
But which was cow and which was tree
No two of us could quite agree,
And JIM himself scarce Knew them.
"H'm, yes," said we, "a pretty show;
But don't you think that JIM might go
And learn to draw? 'Twould help, you
know,
In painting cows and creatures."
"Na, na," his mother answered then,
"An airtist 's no like ither men,
For eh, he 's born, no mad', ye ken—
My JIM shall hae пае teachers."
So JIM worked on as best he might
By artless Nature's simple light,
Untrammelled by a point of sight
Or any such vexation..
But, strange to say, none took the whim
Of buying any gems of him:
They stuck like barnacles to JIM
With grim determination.
A year or two went slowly past,
And JIM grew tired of it at last:
His weary brushes down he cast,
And took instead to drinking.
"Eh!" cried his mother, "let him be.
His mind is overstrained, ye see.
He '11 gist lie fallow for a wee.

A DRY CALLING.
"Тн' OLE SQUIRE STOP AN' SPOKE то ME THIS MARSIN'; AN' Oi AST 'IM '<>w MASTER

DUNNO WOT 'E MEANT, SO Oi DIDN1 SAY NOTHIN' ; BUT Oi BAYS TO MESELF, 'AH,' Oí SAYS,
'FROM WHAT Oi REMEMBER OF 'IM, 'в DIDN' WANT NO CALLII?\'"
Well, JIM lay fallow, and he found
That when he tried to loaf around
His efforts with success were crowned—
No living man could match him.
It was a calling, it was plain,
That suited to a T his vein.
D'you think he '11 ever paint again?
No—JIM knows better—catch him!

TO THE ENRAGED POET.
DKAB SIR EDWIN,—ESAU, in consequence of JACOB'S oily art-
fulness, sold his birthright for a mess of pottage; and if a great
poet chooses to part with a sample of his genius in considera-
tion of receiving a pot of blacking, who shall blame the bard
for doing just exactly what he likes with his own?
Nay, Sir EDWIN, you take this too much to heart.
I confess, that when I opened my Times on Wednesday morn-
ing, and perceived your stirring verses lying in small type sur-
rounded by various advertisements of a distinctly unpoetic
character, I at once turned to the central page to see if you had
been "crowded out" by the publication of the Austinian
1/aureate's ad cap-in-handum verses. But the muse of ALFRED
the Less had not been inspired (I wonder if he got a wigging
t'or his negligence from Her Most Gracious Majesty, forwarded
per Lord SALISBURY ?) to write, and consequently there would
aave been space for one poet inside the great daily journal.
That it should be in small type! in that, to my mind, lay the
indignity. О the pity of it! О the printing of it!
If Sir JOHN MILLAIS'S "Bubbles" had been indifferently re-
produced or belittled (as has your poem by its type) on our
walls, might not that great artist have had a word to say on the
subject to Messrs. FEARS & Co., who purchased the above-
mentioned charming picture for one thousand guineas? Did
not Sir FREDERIC LEIOHTON, P.R.A., has not Professor HER-
KOMER, H.A., done work for hoardings, and do not "hoard-
ings" mean "savings"? I devoutly hope so. If I am wrong
in quoting the above, have not several notable artists contribu-
ted, by pictorial advertisements, to the mural decoration of our
dull city? Then why not verses as advertisement by one of
our leading poets?
When some thrice-happy publisher is fortunate enough to
obtain the right of printing and publishing your poems, my
dear Sir EDWIN, will he publish them without advertisements,
literary perhaps, but that 's as it may be; within the two covers?
Does this derogate from the poet's dignity? Not one whit.
Are not the gems of wit and humour contained in Mr. Punch's
weekly pages invariably framed, as it were, by an outer sheet
of worthy and most useful advertisements?
Then, poet, »lease to moderate the rancour of your pen and
if you can strike the lyre, at three times as much, per chord,
with advertisements, as you can obtain for the same without
advertisements, why, pocket the coin, and sing us the song
which all the world (consider the circulation of these journals)
will be delighted to hear! Who сам sing without notes? Let
the purchasers supply the notes. For yourself, insist only on
two things,—big type, and a central position!

CANTERBURY PILGRIMS.
NINETEENTH CENTURY.
THE LITTLE VULGAR GIRL.
(A Strrrl Stud;/ in the School-Board Em.)
AIR-" The Little Vulgar Boy."
IT was in London yesterday, I strolled a
Board School near;
I saw a little Vulgar Girl—I said, "What
make you here?"
She grinned at me with youthful cheek,
her lip with scorn did curl;
Again I said, "What make you here, oh
little Vulgar Girl??
She sniffed, that little Vulgar Girl! Now
childhood should not scoff,
And when the gentler sex is young, sneers
do not set it off.
She nut her finger in her mouth, the
shrillest shriek arose.
Such as a fierce Red Indian might yell at
savage foes.
"Hush! Don't do ibat, my little miss.
It splits my ears I" I said.
"Garn, you old guffin!" she replied. "Git
'ome and go to bed!"
"Garn P "—"An old guffin?"—"Go to
bed?"—"And this to me? Oh, fie!
It's very wrong for little girls to be so
rude!" said I.
"Way-oh! old wrinkles!" yelled the
child. Then upwards she did fling
Her little heels into the air, like—oh Hike
anything.
I've noticed all about the streets that
girls of tender age
Do fling their little limbs about like
minxes on the stage.
I said, "My little female-girl, I muit,
politely, bog
You not to play such vulgar pranks as
that with your poor leg!
You '11 dislocate your joints, my child!"
She grinned, "AH right, old flick!
You keep yer 'air on, poor old crock.
That's only my 'igh kick!
"There nin't n girl in our Board School
can kick as 'igh as me,
Although I ain't eleven yet, I tyke the
pake, Sir! See?"
With which she sprang, and spun, and
shrieked, a thing of shame and dread,
And, with one final flourish, kicked my
hat from off my head!
I blushed, find picked it from the road. I
said, "My dear young girl,
I 'm sure the Board School cannot teach
you thus to spin and twirl.
I trust they teach you the Three R.'s—
perchance a fourth—but, oh I
Don't you see kicking high like this is
really very lowP"
She placed two fingers in her mouth, and
made a frightful noise,
When up came running several girls, and
also several boys.
"Oh, chummies, 'ere's a lark!" she cried.
"This funny, fat, old fool,
Thinks ihn three R.'s the only things we
learn at our Board School!"
"Oh, Ijttle Vulgar Girl!" I said, "what
is it else you learn P"
She eyed me with a brazen stare which
made me blush and burn.
"Vulgar be blowed, old boy!" she said.
"You Ve been upon the shout I
We learn to darnce, an' smoke, an1 swear,
an'—know our ways about."
"And this is Education, then!" I mused.
"Her legs to twirl
Like minxes at the Music Halls delights
this little girl.
Her grammar 's very shaky, her pronun-
ciation queer,
But her high-kick is marvellous, and can't
she chaff and jeer?
"She and her sort come shrieking round
the square wherein I dwell.
They never play at girlish games, they
always romp and yell.
To battledore and shuttle-cock, skipping-
rope, hoop and stick
They never stoop; their only joys seem
noise and that high-kick.
"I wonder much what sort of wives such
Vulgar Girls will make"
"Wot are you mutterin' of, old boy, and
wot's your little fake?"
The little Vulgar Girl inquired. And then
they all took hands,
And danced about me like wild tribes in
dark and distant lands.
I grabbed my hat, I up and fled, pursued
by their wild shrieks.
I've watched such scenes about my square,
for weeks, and weeks, and weeks,
And what I want to know, what time I
see her blare and twirl,
Is—what will be the future of the little
Vulgar Girl?

A STORY ABOUT :ТНАТ ILLUSTRIOUS
PHOTOGRAPH.
( Translated j'mm the German. Origin uncertain.)
HAVINO nothing to do—I am tired of
composing national songs and giving di-
rections to people to paint pictures for
me^—I may as well turn my hand to nar-
ration. Shall some day attempt a ro-
mance. Got an idea already. Young
man in love with young lady. One poor
the other rich. Girl (wealthy) has a
haughty mother. Mother won't let girl
marry poor young man, who commits sui-
cide. Capital notion. Only got to find
some novelist fellow ]UoG to write the thing
for me. Ought to be a companion to my
cartoon. Sell like wildfire.
But I want to jot down how I came to
send that photo. Fact is, I didn't know
I had it. I had just been forwarding a
batch of telegrams to a lot of interesting
people.— the Khalifa, chap commanding
hostile Arabs in the Soudan, and others—
when I came across an English paper.
Looked through it and found it abused
me I Never saw such ingratitude! Why,
I actually speak English, and if I have
opposed England in every possible shape
for the last few years, what does it mat-
ter P It's only a pleasant little way I
have. My fun! I am an immensely
amusing chap when I please to be. I
never laughed so much in my life as when
I turned off poor old BIZZY. He was tm
surprised! I had flattered the poor old
chap up to the skies, so, when I turned
round and told him to go, his astonishment
was absolutely killing 1 I could scarcely
keep my countenance sufficiently to make
him a duke, or something of that sort. Poor
old BIZZY! But it was screamingly funny!
Next to the abuse of me in the English
paper was a column devoted to an account
of the SULTAN'S atrocities. His Imperial
Majesty is a wag like myself, but I really
think he does sometimes carry a joke a
; little too far. Comical to turn bludgeons
to account in preserving order, but, pro-
tracted, the custom becomes monotonous.
Old GLADSTONE'S nickname for him rather
appropriate—" the Great Assassin." How-
i ever, I waded through the page, and then
my eye was attracted by an unopened
parcel. I unloosed the string, and there
was a big photograph of myself in the uni-
form of a British admiral! I didn't want
the beastly thing! So a happy thought
struck me. I put it back in the paper and
sent it to the SULTAN!

"Garn?"—"An old guffin?"—"Go to
bed?"—"And this to me? Oh, fie!
It's very wrong for little girls to be so
rude!" said I.
"Way-oh! old wrinkles!" yelled the
child. Then upwards she did fling
Her little heels into the air, like—oh 1 like
anything.
I've noticed all about the streets that
girls of tender age
По fling their little limbs about like
minxes on the stage.
I said. "My little female-girl, I must,
politely, bng
You not to play such vulgar pranks as
that with your poor leg!
You '11 dislocate your jointe, my child I"
She grinned, "All right, old flick!
You keep yor 'air on, poor old crock.
That 's only my 'igh kick!
"There nin't a girl in our Board School
can kick as 'igh as me,
Although I ain't eleven yet, I tyke the
rake, Sir! Kfef"
With which she sprang, and spun, and
shrieked, a thine of shame and dread,
And, with one final flourish, kicked my
hat from off my head!
I blushed, and picked it from the road. I
said, "My dear young girl,
I'm sure the Board School cannot teach
you thus to spin and twirl.
I trust they teach you the Three R.'s—
perchance a fourth—but, oh I
Don't you see kicking high like this is
really very low?"
She placed two fingers in her mouth, aiid
made a frightful noise,
When up came running several girls, and
also several boys.
"Oh, chummies, 'ere's a lark!" she cried.
"This funny, fat, old fool,
Thinks the three R.'s the only things we
learn at our Board School!"
"Oh, little Vulgar Girl!" I said, "what
is it else you learn?"
She eyed me with a brazen stare which
made me blush and burn.
"Vulgar be blowed, old boy!" she said.
"Fou 've been upon the shout!
We learn to darnce, an' smoke, an' swear,
an'—know our ways about."
"And this is Education, then!" I mused.
"Her legs to twirl
Like minxes at the Music Halls delights
this little girl.
Her grammar's very shaky, her pronun-
ciation queer,
But her high-kick is marvellous, and can't
she chaff and jeer?
"She and her sort come shrieking round
the square wherein I dwell.
They never play at girlish games, they
always romp and yell.
To battledore and shuttle-cock, skipping-
rope, hoop and stick
They never stoop; their only joys seem
noise and that high-kick.
"I wonder much what sort of wives such
Vulgar Girls will make"
"Wot are you mutterin' of, old boy, and
wot's your little fake?"
The little Vulgar Girl inquired. And then
they all took hands.
And danced about me like wild tribes in
dark and distant lands.
I grabbed my hat, I up and fled, pursued
by their wild shrieks.
I've watched such scenes about my square,
for weeks, and weeks, and weeks,
And what I want to know, what time I
see her blare and twirl,
Is—what will be the future of the little
Vulgar Girl?

A STORY ABOUT ГГНАТ ¿ILLUSTRIOUS
PHOTOGRAPH.
( Translated from the German. Origin uncerta in. )
HAVING nothing to do—I am tired of
composing national songs and giving di-
rections to people to paint pictures for
me—I may as well turn my hand to nar-
ration. Shall some day attempt a ro-
mance. Got an idea already. Young
man in love with young lady. One poor
the other rich. Girl (wealthy) has a
haughty mother. Mother won't let girl
marry poor young man, who commits sui-
cide. Capital notion. Only got to find
some novelist fellow ju.->c to write the thing
for me. Ought to be a companion to my
cartoon. Sell like wildfire.
But I want to jot down how I came to
send that photo. Fact is, I didn't know
I had it. I had just been forwarding a
hatch of telegrams to a lot of interesting
people •— the Khalifa, chap commanding
hostile Arabs in the Soudan, and others—
when I сатв across an English paper.
Looked through it and found it abused
me I Never saw such ingratitude! Why,
I actually speak English, and if I have
opposed England in every possible shape
for the last few years, what dnfs it mat-
ter? It 's only a pleasant little way I
have. My fun! I am an immensely
amusing chap when I please to be. I
never laughed so much in my life as when
I turned off poor old BIZZT. He was .so
surprised! I had flattered the poor old
chap up to the skies, so, when I turned
round and told him to go, his astonishment
was absolutely killing! I could scarcely
keep my countenance sufficiently to make
him a duke, or something of that sort. Poor
old BIZZT! But it was screamingly funny!
Next to the abuse of me in the English
paper was n column devoted to an account
of the STTLTAN'S atrocities. His Imperial
Majesty is a wag like myself, but I really
think he does sometimes carry a joke a
Unie too far. Comical to turn bludgeons
to account in preserving order, but, pro-
tracted, the custom becomes monotonous.
Old GLADSTONE'S nickname for him rather
appropriate—"the Great Assassin." How-
ever, I waded through the page, and then
my eye was attracted by an unopened
parcel. I unloosed the string, and there
was a big photograph of myself in the uni-
form of a British admiral! I didn't want
the beastly thing! So a happy thought
struck me. I put it back in the paper and
sent it to the SULTAN!

ELOREAT HOVA!
BRIGHTON, as well as France, has, it
seems, a difficulty with its Hovas, if the
inhabitants of the "residential and quiet
town" of Hove—whose " eccentric motto"
(as the Daily Chronicle calls it) is "Flo-
reat Hova "—may be so called. As France
desires to absorb the Hovas, so Brighton,
it seems, wishes to "amalgamate" Hove.
Brighton is brisk and bustling; Hove, like
the celebrated young lady in the epitaph,
is "bland, quiet, and deeply religious."
Also it possesses "several important
powers and privileges" which it does not
wish to lose by being " merged" in uppish,
up-to-date London-on-Sea.
Brightness, Briskness, Business, Bustle,
Are the Busy B's of Brighton;
But to hear the green leaves rustle,
See green lawns eve's gentle light on,
Are sweet things that tired ones love
In that peaceful haven, Hove I
Doctor Brighton is a tonic,
Sedative, perchance, is Hove.
Let them Uve in bliss harmonic,
Neighbours in contiguous love,
Like the lion and the lamb,
But without a hint of "cram."
Love means not "amalgamation,"
Independent friendship's better.
Hove her own administration
Wants to keep. Well, why not let her?
Modern wisdom does not hallow
The old policy of swallow.
Hove would not be made a martyr
To the ghoul Centralisation;
So she fights for her old charter
'Gainst big Brighton's annexation.
Let them live in neighbour love,
Brighton Brighton, Hove still Hove!
Big things will be consequential.
Hove declares with bold temerity
That her "quiet, residential
Character gives her prosperity."
Punch admits he oft doth love a
"Quiet spot," so—"Floreat Hova!"
AN EXTRA NOTE.
THE Frascati Restaurant has just insti-
tuted a " Musical Luncheon," that is, when
the pie is open the band begins to play.
An overture for the commencement—Ou-
verture de bouches. Grand march for an
entrée. A warlike song, "Aux Armes,
Citoyen»!" for the pièce de resistance.
Something sweet to follow, with a Ranz
des Vaches for the cheese. Excellent in
its way—if you are alone. But if you
want to talk, how then? Perhaps there
is another room for the talkers — this
would be a salle à тапдет-et-à parler com-
bined. As "music is the food of love"
there should be a pleasant reserved corner
called "The Bird-cage," for example,
where would be served, quite close to the

(Bv BABOO HUBBY Виновно JABBBBJKB, B.A.)
No. XXIV.
Mr. Jabbcrjec relaies his experiences upon the Moors.
I AM now an acclimatized denizen of Caledonia stern and wild;
which, however, turns out to be milder and tamer than depicted
by the jaundiced hand of national jealousy.
For, since my arrival at this hamlet of Kilpaitrick, N.B., I
have not once beheld any species of savage hill-man; moreover,
the adult inhabitants are clothed with irreproachable decency,

"Of incredible bashfulneea imd bucolical appearance."
and, if the juveniles run about with denuded feet and heads,
where is the shocking scandal?
Mr. ALLBUTT-INNBTT, sen., did me the honour to appear in
person upon the Kilpaitrick platform, and welcome me with out-
spread arms to his temporary hearth and home, but I shall have
the candour of confessing my disappointment with the size and
appearance of the same. It appears that a "Manse" is not at all
a palatial edifice, furnished with a plethora of marble halls and
vassals and serfs, &c., but simply the very so-so and two-storied
abode of some local priest!
My gracious hostess was to tender profuse apologies for its
homeliness, on the plea that it is refreshing at times to lay aside
ceremonial magnificence and unbend in rural simplicity, though
it is not humanly possible to unbend oneself upon the thorny
bosoms of chairs and couches severely upholstered with the
prickling hairs of an extinct horse.
Still, as I assured MLss WEE-WEB, she is the happy owner of a
magical knack to transform, by her sheer apparition, the hum-
blest hovel into the first-class family residence with every modern
With the said Miss I continue on terms of hand and glove-
ship, with mutual harmless jokes, which would perhaps be as
caviare on toast to a general, though I shall venture to recount
some examples.
A certain local young laird, of incredible bashfulness and buco-
lical appearance, is a frequent visitor at the manse, and the
fervent admirer of Miss WEB-WEB, who cannot endure the tedium
of his society, and is constantly endeavouring to escape there-
from.
Now bis name is Mr. Свим, and I have frequently entertained
her in private by play upon the word, alluding to him as " Mister
CBUST/' "Mister OATCAKE," or "the Scotch Bun," and the like;
but he informed me that he preferred to be addressed as "Bal-
bannock," and upon my inquiring his reasons for selecting such
an alias, he answered that it was because he inhabited a house of
that name.
Whereupon I facetiously requested that he would address my-
self in future as "Mister Seventy-nine, Hereford Road, Bays-
water," which stroke of wit occasioned inextinguishable merri-
ment from Miss WEE-WEB, though it did not excite from the
aforesaid laird so much as the smallest simper 1
From an ingrained love of teasing, and also the natural desire
to stimulate her appreciation of my superior fertility in small
talk and L'ait de plaire, I do often slyly contrive to inflict his
sole society upon her—to the huge entertainment of her father
and mother, who carry on the joke by assisting my manoauver-
ings; but, although it affords me a flattering gratification to be
plaintively upbraided by Miss WEE-WEB for my cruel desertion,
I am resolved not to persist in such heartless pranks beyond her
natural endurance.
Shortly after my arrival, I heard from my host that he was the
recipient of an invitation from a Mister BAOSHOT, Q.C., that he
and his son HOWABD would accompany bim to a shooting ex-
pedition upon some adjacent moors, and that, being now im-
moderately plump, and past his prime as a potshot, he had re-
quested leave to nominate myself as his Innlli or substitute,
explaining that I was 'a young Indian prince of great prowess at
every kind of big games.
Accordingly, to my great delight, it was arranged that I should
take his place.
My young friend HOWABD, beholding me appear at the break-
fast-table arrayed in my short kilt and superincumbent belly-
purse with tassels, did entreat me to change myself into ordinary
knickerbockers, lest I should catch death with a cold.
But I declined, disdaining such dangers, and assuring him that
I did not at all dislike the excessive ventilation of my knees.
We drove to Mr. ВАоанот'в residence, Rowans Castle, in a
hired machine, and found the gentlemen-shooters gathered out-
side the portico. Amongst the party I was pleased to observe
Hon'ble Justice CUMMBBBUND, who, when we were all ascended
into the waggonette-break, did rally me very good-humouredly
upon some mixed bag of elephants and tigers he had heard (or
so he said) I had accomplished in some up-country jungle.
At first, knowing that this was the utter impossibility, I per-
spired with terror that he was making me the fool, but apparently
he was himself under a misunderstanding, for when we had left
the vehicle and were preparing to advance, he paid me the dis-
tinguished compliment or entreating that I might be awarded
the command of one extremity of the line, while he himself was
to preside over the opposite end I
And thus we commenced to climb a steep hill, thickly covered
with a very pricklesome heather, and black slimy bogs, wherein
the varnish of my patent-leather shoes did soon become totally
dimmed. So, being gravely incommoded by the shortness of my
wind, I entrusted my musket to an under-keeper, begging him to
inform me of the early approach of any stag or deer.
However, we saw nothing to shoot at except various sorte of
wild poultry, and when some of these fJew up immediately in
front of me, I was too late, owing to the carriage of my gun
by an underling, to do more than fire off a couple of barrels as
a declaration of hostility.
But profiting by this lesson in being semper paratus, I refused
to part again with my deadly instrument, and stumbled manfully
onwards with finger upon the triggers, letting them fly instan-
taneously at the first appearance of any animals fera naturae.
It is not customary, I woe assured, to slay the wild sheep in
these districts, though horned, and of an excessively ferocious
appearance, and even when firing my bullets at birds, I was
subjected to continual reproofs from some officious keeper or
other.
For example, I was not to shoot into a flock of partridges, for
the superstitious reason, forsooth 1 that it was still the month of
improvement.
August, which is supposed to be unlucky!

Again, I was rebuked for burning powder at a grey hen, be-
cause it is the wife of a black-cock, which may be shot with im-
punity. Although a highly chivalrous chap in questions of the
fairer sex, I am yet to see why it is allowable to render the female
bird a bereaved widow, but totally forbidden to make the male
a widower I Or why it is permissible to slay a minute bird such
as a snipe, while a titlark is on no account to be touched.
Being eventually exasperated by these unreasonable faultfind-
ings, seeing that I had merely emptied my gun-barrels without
actually destroying any of these sacred volátiles, I addressed the
keeper in the withering tones of a sarcasm: "Mister Keeper," I
said, "as I am not the ornithologist or soothsayer to distinguish
infallibly every species of bird by instinct, when flying with in-
credible velocity, would it not be better that I should discharge
no shots in future?"
To which, abashed by my severity, he replied that he could not
just say that it would make any considerable difference whether
I fired at all or none.
My fellow-shooters, however, could not refrain from shouting
with irrepressible admiration at the intrepidity with which, fore-
stalling the fleetest dogs, I did rush forward to pick up the
fallen grouse-birds, and repeatedly exhorted me to take greater
care for my own safety.
I cannot say that they exhibited equivalent courageousness,
seeing that, so often as I raised my gun to fire, they flung them-
selves upon their stomachs in the heather until I had
finished, upon which I rallied them mercilessly upon their
timidity, assuring them repeatedly that they had nothing to fear.
Yet English and Scotch alike accuse us Bengalees of being
subject to excessive funkinesa. What about the Pot and the
Kettle, Misters?
I am to reserve the conclusion of my shooting experiences until
a future occasion.

SUGGESTION то rit к CAMBRIDGE A. D. C. AMATEUR DRAMATIC
CLUB.—"An Outsider" writes to us:—"How is it that there
should have so long existed in the town of Cambridge,
and belonging to the University, the unique play of an author
whose work, whether he be yet in this world or out of it, has
never yet been tried on your stage, i.e., 'PARKER'S piece'? A
friend of mine, a Cantab, tells me has often 'seen some play on
it,' but, as far as I can gather, without any acknowledgement
having been made as to the original source."
OUR ONLY ONE.—Our Poet-Laureate, ALFREDO, is rarely so
good as when he is writing prose. See his letter in Murninii
Pott last week. Then, like "Little DAVY GAKHICK," when
His mither wudna kent him, they had altered him that strange!
inspired, he is "quite six foot high."

À Monsieur Punch.
DEAR MISTER,—I have said you how I
am of return—de retour—to the hotel that
afternoon of the Sunday in that droll of
"fly," by a veritable tempest. Eh well,
I rest—je reste—at the hotel, I dine, I
smoke a cigar, and then I go to see if he
falls still of the rain. Parbleu—by blue,
he makes beautiful! I seek my by-above
—-pardessus, how say you?—and my hat.
At present I have but one sole, and it
wants not to risk him by this wind. Hap-
pily, I remember myself that I bought at
Edimbourg a Scottish bonnet, un bonnet

"A pretty little burgess Mias."
écossais, a droll of bonnet with two long
ribbons behind, almost as those on the
hat of a woman. In effect these ribbons
are also well useful for to be tied under the
chin, but they should to be a little more
long. However, I sqcceed to tie them,
and, wearing my bonnet, I go to make a
little walk at the clear of the moon. He
makes less of wind. And truly as I smoke
a cigar, strolling all gently on the prome-
nade, so well lightened, éclairée, it seems
to me that Brighton is not after all so
beast—si bête. It goes without to say
that the Sunday one cannot to amuse
himself. As partout in England, all is
shut, excepted the bar, the tavern, the
pubhcouse, and the ginpalais. But it is
something that to walk himself at the
border и! the sea, to smoke a cigar, to
encounter his friends, even, for a stranger
as me, to regard the pretty little bur-
gesses misses, demoiselles bourgeoises, per-
haps employeds of the magazines of con-
fections, magasins de confections pour
dame», or other little misses of counter,
demoiselles de comptoir—how say you all
that P Truly it is not so beast, above all
when he makes beautiful.
At the instant that I think that, a drop
of rain falls on my nose, I regard effaré the
sky of new all cloudy and sombre, à pas
de course je file—at step of course I file
upon the hotel, and I gain the entry at
the moment where the tempest rebegins.
By blue, what climate I
Monday in awaking myself I think,
he goes to make beautiful. It is impos-
sible that he falls all days of the rain at
the English Nice." l'a* dit tout, not of
the whole 1 For the rain falls as if he
came of to begin. Oh, what villain time
All desolated I descend for to take m \
cup of coffee to the milk—café au lait,
how say you '( I cannot to eat your eng-
li-.li "breakfast "—the kipered haddocks,
the poached hams, the eggs, the sausages,
the biftecks, the cutlets, and all that,
with some "mufins "—ah ça, quelle horreur:
—and some jams. Ah, nol And see
there as I eat one little bread, un petit
pain, a ray of sunshine I And when I go
out, the paving, the road, all is dry, the
sun shines and the sky is blue. It is not
precisely the blue of Nice, but in fine the
blow of the eye is not entirely grey. All
joyously I walk myself on the promenade,
and I regard the bicyclist ladies, who
mount so well. What pleasure to see
them! They are so beautiful, so gay, so
gracious, so sveltes—how say you P As 1
regard them I am almost overthrown by
a chaise roulante, what you call a "chair
of Bath." And then I remark many of
these chairs of Bath, enormous, gigantic,
as heavy as—tiens /—as your bun of Bath!
Ah, by this beautiful morning, even a
little calembour is permitted, n'est-ce pas f
Then I arrive to the Aquarium, but I
enter not, for it is absolutely a subterra-
nean, un souterrain, and he has the air of
a mausoleum, of a humid tomb. Instead
of that I regard the old jetty, the "Shain-
pir." All to near, tout auprès, there is
another jetty, all ruined, all rusty, all in-
complete. One says in your country,
"Half done is well begun," but this jetty
is not well begun, and she has the air of
never to be finished. Why leave her
there, an object so miserable? I have
never seen anything of more frightful.
At Brighton they love the iron, for to-
wards the east extends herself an arcade of
the most drolls; an interminable range of
arches in cast iron, painted in sombre col-
ours. So ugly, my faith, so ugly I A
friend has told me that there was here
formerly a pretty little promenade,
adorned with shrubs and with ivy, some-
thing of green at Brighton where there is
almost not of trees, and that all that was
destroyed to construct this hideous arcade,
which has cost more than one half million
of francs, perhaps in fine one million!
And nobody goes there, excepted some
childs and their goods—bintiirs, how say
you? It is as a travesty of one cloister of
a Campo Santo. Figure to yourself, Mit-
ter Punch, one side of the Campo Santo
of Pisa in cast iron! Ah, the good idea!
I make present of her to Misters the Mu-
nicipal Councillors of Brighton. Their
beautiful arcade would be more superb
with some monuments—also in cast iron—
of the great personages of their artistic
town. There is enough of iron in the
ruined jetty for to fabricate an infinity of
busts and of statues for the Campo Santo
of Brighton. Agree, &c.,

A LOBSTER swam in the Western Sea,
Weary and heavy of heart was he
As he ploughed through the Qulf
Stream's wrack;
For all around him was fair to see
In the ocean, green as the vernal pea>—
But the lobster's shell was black.
He sighed at the sea-weed's radiant hue,
And the mussel-shell's cerulean blue,
And the mackerel's mottled back';
He wept when he saw the whiting pure,
And fled away into nooks obscure,
For the lobster's shell was black.
He gazed at the tinte of the graceful
prawn,
And the roseate hues of early dawn,
And he bitterly cried "Alack!
The sea-gull is white as the driven snow,
And the star-fish shinea with a fiery glow,
Oh, why is my shell so black!"
* * • •
They fished him out of the lobster-pot,
And plunged him in water—boiling hot,
Until they pronounced him dead;
Then turned hia carcase on to a dish,
But oh, how changed was the weary fish,
For the lobster's shell was red I
Yes, that which in life he had sought so
sore
Was granted him now that life was o'er,
And the worn-out spirit had fled;
For Death in pity had heard his cry,
And changed his hue to a brighter dye,
And the lobster's shell was red.
No more the electric eel would shock
His sensitive nerves, nor the turtle's mock
Would cause him to hide his head;
No more would he sigh at the sea-gull's
flights,
Nor feel abashed at the Northern Lights,
For the lobster's shell was red.
The storm-tossed body they gently lay
In a lonely aspic far away,
Far from his Western bays;
They softly smooth out his wrinkled legs
And cover him o'er with the white of
eggs,
And the peaceful mayonnaise.
There blossoms the fragrant cucumber,
There the vinegar flows, and there
The lettuce her leaves doth shed;

And there by all may be clearly seen,
Through the transparent gelatine,
That the lobster's shell is redi

BRIGHTON.
À Monsieur Punch.
DEAR MISTER,—I have said you bow I
am of return—de retour—to the hotel that
afternoon of the Sunday in that droll of
"fly," by a veritable tempest. Eh well,
I rest—je reate—at the hotel, I dine, 1
smoke a cigar, and then I go to see if he
falls still of the rain. Parbleu—by blue,
he makes beautiful! I seek my by-above
•—pardessus, how say you?—and my hat.
At present I have but one sole, and it
wants not to risk him by this wind. Hap-
pily, I remember myself that I bought at
Edimbourg a Scottish bonnet, un bonnet

"A pretty little burgesa Mies."
écossais, a droll of bonnet with two long
ribbons behind, almost aa those on the
hat of a woman. In effect these ribbons
are also well useful for to be tied under the
chin, but they should to be a little more
long. However, I succeed to tie them,
and, wearing my bonnet, I go to make a
little walk at the clear of the moon. He
makes less of wind. And truly as I smoke
a cigar, strolling all gently on the prome-
nade, so well lightened, éclairée, it seems
to me that Brighton is not after all so
beast—si bete. It goes without to say
that the Sunday one cannot to amuse
himself. As partout in England, all is
shut, excepted the bar, the tavern, the
pubhcouse, and the ginpalais. But it is
something that to walk himself at the
border of the sea, to smoke a cigar, to
encounter his friends, even, for a stranger
as me, to regard the pretty little bur-
gesses misses, demoiselles bourgeoises, per-
haps employeds of the magazines of con-
fections, magasins de confections pour
dames, or other little misses of counter,
demoiselles de comptoir—how say you all
that? Truly it is not so beast, above all
when he makes beautiful.

"Good morning," I said, as soon as I partly regained my self-
oossessipn. "I have called, on behalf of the Society for the
Protection of Ancient Reputations, to inquire if it is true that
vou have blown upon HOMER and pricked the SHAKBPEARB
bubble."
"Quite so," replied the Demolisher; "reputations more than
v day old are as worthless as yesterday's morning paper. They
become fetishes, and it is my pleasant duty to expose them.
The persons you mentioned have ceased to move with the
4mes. I have therefore abolished them."
"Are PLATO and VIRGIL, and .Жвснтитв and HORACE, and the

"My dear Sir, PLATO never spoke in Hyde Park, that I am
\ware of. He is therefore out of court. .Жвснтшя, I under-
stand, wrote tragedies in blank verse, but they are not now
olayed at any London theatre. He would not get a 'hand'
lowadays. HORACE, so far as I have patience to read him, is
lainfully suburban, and his views on bimetallism and WAGNER
are crude in the extreme. VIRGIL served his purpose in
supplying a title for Arma and the Man, but he is an imposition,
and rightly used as such. I would not give the bones of a
chocolate soldier for the rest."
"Are we to give up our belief in the more modern writers
of note, as well?"
"Most decidedly. Take DANTE, for instance. He couldn't
even write decent English; and RABELAIS, who wouldn't write
decent French. And BACON, who I am told wrote Paradise
Lnst, and The Sorrows of Satan, and much other sensational
journalism of a bygone day, besides knocking off '.Чнлк-
SPEARK' in his spare moment«. They are all as hopelessly
parochial and prehistoric as DICKENS and THACKERAY. It posi-
tively hurt« me to think how contemptible they are compared
with myself. Why, it is as much as I can do to keep from
tearing out my hair in handfuls with disgust at hearing them
called 'eminent writers !'"
"Are there no ideals, then, left for us to cherish?" I de-
spairingly asked. "For example, don't you still retain a good
opinion of the Equator P"
"The Equator, my good Sir, is too despicable for words. It
has no sense of humour, and cannot appreciate a paradox.
Its only use is as a salutary terror to the fourth-form schoolboy.
I do not recognise its existence as a serious factor in modern
life."
"Then you probably don't think much of the Solar System,
if I may hazard a final question?"
"I consider it a vastly overrated institution, in spite of the
advertisement it has received from interested parties. I spend
half-an-hour every day despising it. This is a useful practice,
I find, and keeps the Universe in ite proper place. I feel like
ATHANASITTS—or was it ARCHIMEDES?—contra mundum, as I
walk down Southampton Street. It is an exhilarating sensa-
tion, I assure you, pushing the planet away from beneath one's
feet. The other day I measured my length on the pavement
(assisted by a piece of orange-peel), and got up with a most
profound contempt for the Law of Gravitation. But if
you will excuse me, now, I have an engagement with a Popular
Idol, whom I have arranged to pulverise."

THE EARLIEST RECORD OF THE APPEARANCE OF THE SEA-SERPENT.
This remarkable Picture from an Egyptian Illustrated Paper is accompanied by the following unpublished remarks of Herodotus, us Special
Correspondent :—
I went to a certain place called Pelusium, which is tit the mouth of the Nile, to make inquiries concerning the great eea-eerpent. For it was told
me that every year, after the rising of the Senate, and while the Chief Magistrates are away from the city, there appears in the ocean, not far from the
harbour, a monstrous snake. All affirmed it to be many parasangs in length, and exceeding fierce, some described it as of a dingy white colour, and as
advancing silently »nd with a sinuous motion: о hers, on the other hand, declaring it to be mottled with the most gorgeous colours, to proceed by leaps
like a dolphin, mid with hideous bellowing;. All agreed that it only appears when the Senate is not sitting. Thus I conclude the subject of the sea-serpent.
THE CAB-HIRERS VADE МЕСИМ.
(During the Strike.)
Question. If you are on your way to
town from the country, what should you
do, say, when you get within one hundred
miles of London?
Answer. I should beg the railway guard
to wire to the terminus to engage a con-
veyance for me on my arrival.
Q. What will be the consequences of
this proceeding p
A. Assuming that my train is half-an-
hour late I shall have to wait a further
thirty minutes for the identiftcation of my
Jehu and his chariot.
Q. To whom and to what do you refer?
A. To the railway employé on the box of
the company's cab.
Q. Say that you are seated, what will
happen next?
A. I shall give my address, and then
personally conduct the driver.
Q. Why will this superintendence be
necessary?
A. Because, being "new to town," the
coachman will fancy that Eaton Square is
near the Tower, and Oxford Street within
a stone's throw of Waterloo Bridge.
Q. Suppose you desire to get from Ken-
sington to Hyde Park Corner, what would
be the route chosen by the driver, without
your directions?
A. Very likely he would make for
Olympia, then wander into Bayswater,
visit Bloomsbury, skirt Pimlico, and come
to Apsley House via the King's Road,
Sloane Square, the Brompton Road, and
Knightebridge.
Q. Then if you are encumbered with
luggage, what should you do?
\A. Send it to its destination either by
Private Delivery or Parcels Post.

Q. And how would you yourself get
home?
A. By walking.
Q. But surely this would cause you in-
convenience?
A. Possibly. But it would be far safer
to trust to legs than to wheels.
Q. Why would it be safer?
A. Because nearly all the streets of
London are "up," and consequently it
would be better to climb the pavement
with an alpen-stock than to drive through
the gas-pipes in a hansom.
THE PIANO-BABY'S LULLABY.
[Many of the itinerant artietet of Saffron Hill
consider that their apparatus is incomplete without

MISERABLE infant,
To the organ tied,
Trundled down the dirty street,
Swaddled tightly head and feet,
For your daily ride!
Wretched little morsel,
Squalling little brat,
Thoiiijh the wheezy barrel turns,
'Tis through you your parent earns
Ha'pence in his hat!
Small and howling human,
Soon no more you '11 hear,
Growing quickly deaf as stone,
Thanks to each discordant tone
Ground into your ear.
Truly, for two buttons,
This is what I 'd do:
I 'd a stout policeman fetch,
Take your father up, the wretch,
Smash the organ, too!

JOTTINGS AND TITTLINGS.
(Bv BABOO HUBRT BUNQSHO JABBERJEE, B.A.)
No. XXV.
Mr. Jabbcijee permits himself to make a most unwarranted attack upon a
distinguished fellow-contributor, and to criticise the Editorial dis-
cretion with considerable freedom. After which he concludes the
thrilling account of his experiences on a Scotch moor, greatly to his
own glorification.
MAT I humbly be permitted to commence this with the
personal explanation?
The gracious and patronising readers of this periodical must
often, very properly, have experienced sensations of profound
disgust and disappointment to find almost every alternate number

"I presented my trophy »lid trmsure-trov«; to the fuirylike Mise Wee-wee."
of Punch completely destitute of a single jot or tittle from this
pen; in consequence from which my experiences when (at last)
suffered to appear have become totally ex post facto! For this
dilatoriness tin- responsible party is not myself.
I am ready at any time to occupy an entire number with my
unassuming lucubrations, which would then be up to their
date; but of course it seems that, to the Editorial optic, the
jejune scribblings of some foreign Mister are of more pressing
importance, though ludicrously incapable to write intelligible
or idiomatic English style, and interlarded with frequent Galli-
cisms of very, very dubious correctness I
Far be it from me to raise an international question at a
rather difficult crisis, but I must meekly suggest that it is un-
worthy of a patriotic periodical to snub the nose of a cultivated
British subject by postponing his contributions to those of this
so-called Аиосвтв, who is admittedly a mere Parisian French-
man. I may return to this subject anon—if necessary. Verbum
sat sap.
Now to resume the rather arbitrarily truncated account of my
Before luncheon I ventured to remonstrate earnestly with
my entertainer, Mr. BAGSHOT, Q.C., concerning the extreme
severity with which he chastised a juvenile sporting hound of
his for such trivial offences as running after some rabbit, or
picking up slaughtered volatiles without receiving the mot
d'ordre!
"Listen, honourable Sir," I entreated him, "to the voice of
Reason! It 's the second nature of all such canines to pursue
v<-ruiins, nor are they at all capable of comprehending the Why
and Wherefore of a shocking flagellation. If it is your wish that
this hound should play the part of a Tantalus, forbidden even to
touch the bonne-bouches with his watering mouth, surely it is
possible to restrain him by a more humane method than Brute
Force I"
At this mild reproof Mister BAGSHOT became utterly rubescent,
murmuring excuses which I did not catch , and 1, perceiving
that this object lesson of kindness to animals from an Oriental
had strongly affected all the shooters, patted the hound on the
forehead, consoling him with some chocolate 1 carried in my
cartridge sack.
We picnicked our lunch under a stone wall, and I, becoming
an hilarious, rallied my companions unmercifully upon the
solemnity with which they had marched in cautious silence,
and with stern countenances as to attack some formidable
foe—and all to slaughter sundry braces of inoffensive grouse-
birds—truly an heroical sort of undertaking I
To which Hon'ble ОВШПВВОЯВ replied, with his utterance
impeded by cold pie, that I might congratulate myself on
Having kept my own hands unstained b; any grouse's gore.
"True, Mister Ex-Judge," I retorted, "but as you have
already testified," (here 1 hoisted his own petard at him rather
ingeniously,) "I am more an au fait in the extermination of ele-
phants et hoc genus omne, and have hitherto reserved my powder
and shot for a stag or some similar monarch of the glen. How-
ever, after lunch let us see whether 1 am not competent to kill,
or at least maim, one of these same grouse-fowls, faute de
mievx I"
A repartee which excited uproarious laughter (at Hon'ble C.'s
expense ¿ from all the present company.
Subsequently, we were posted ш a row of small fortresses
constructed of turfs, to await what is termed a "Drive," i.e.,
until eome flock of grouse-birds, exasperated to fury by the
cries and blows of certain individuals called "beaters," should
attack our positions.
Hearing that the grouses on this moor were of an excessive
wildness, I was at first apprehensive that one might fly at my
nose or eyes while I was busied in defending myself against
its fellows, but the keeper who was with me assured me that
such was seldom their custom.
And, indeed, such as came in my direction flew with wings
so accelerated by panic that they were invisible before I could
even select one as my target, so I was reduced to fire with con-
siderable random. Presently the beaters approached, carrying
flags of truce, and we sallied out of our forts to pick up the
slain and wounded. After diligent search, I had the happiness
to discover a grouse-bird, stone dead, in the heather, and,
capering with triumph, called to the keeper to come and see
the врой.
On his arrival, however, he said that he could not just think
it would be my bird, as he had not noticed any fall in that
direction. But after I had presented him with a piece of silver,
be did agree that if I chose to claim the bird as mine, it was
not bis place to contradict me, and so in great glee I exhibited
my prize to the others, appealing to the keeper (who basely
remained soito voce) for confirmation.
"A devilish clean shot, Prince!" Sir CUMMERBUND graciously
remarked; "why, the bird is stiff and cold already I"
Whereupon I was cordially congratulated, and awarded the
:iil feathers to decorate my "tommyshanty," and during the
next driving, having now acquired the knack, I rendered several
more denizens of the air the hors de combatí, though—either
on account of their great ingenuity in running out of the
radius, or creeping into holes, «fee., or else the stupidity of the
retrieving dogs—their corpses remained irrecoverable.
On taking my leave, I expressed unbounded satisfaction with
such sport, as I had had, and my fixed intention to assist on
some similar shooting-expedition, and Mr. BAOSHOT kindly
jromised to let me know if he should again have vacancy for
in additional gun.
I regret to say that young HOWABD, who, having only laid
low a couple of black cocks and a blue hare, was immoderately

insinuating that my grouse was one which, having been seri-
ously wounded by other hands some days previously, had come
up to the hills to shuffle off ite mortal coil in seclusion, arguing
thus from its total absence of heat and suppleness.
This is the merest quibble, and to travel out of the record,
since, of course, if a bird is at all of a venerable age, it becomes
stiff and deficient in vital warmth long before it is popped off!
Moreover, if the grouse were not legitimately my property, why,
forsooth, should I be permitted to carry it home?
I presented my trophy and treasure-trove to the fairylike
Miss WEE-WEE, who was so overwhelmed by the compliment
that she entreated for it to be cooked and eaten instanter.
As soon as I have recovered a missing link of my fishing-rod
(which it seems has been overlooked by Mister Pawnbroker),
and when I have procured some suitable bait, &c., it is my
intention to catch a fine salmon out of the burn for my en-
chanting divinity, and, as I place the fish in her lily-like hands,
to strike iron while it is hot and make her the formal proposal
of matrimony.
Mister CRUM, hearing of my piscatorial ambitions, has, with
almost incredible simplicity, offered to lend me his salmon rod,
with a volume of flies, little suspecting that he will be assisting
me to cateh two fish upon one hook! I am immensely tickled
by such a tip-top joke, and can scarcely refrain from imparting
it to Miss WEE-WKB herself, though I shall wait until I have
first secured the salmon.
I had some valuable remarks upon Scottish idioms and
linguistic peculiarities, &c., but these, of course, are to be
suppressed sine die—unless I am to be permitted to overflow
into a special supplement.

HONOURED SIR,—The mystic veil, which is invariably thrown
by cruel Fortune over the result of a big handicap, shall, if pos-
sible, be rent asunder by the old and ever ready seer, whose eye
has lost none of its Rontgen-ray penetration. As you are well
aware, Sir, it is at this time of year that many owners, to say
nothing of backers, are anxious to provide themselves with
a copious supply of winter keep, and thus it is that "bottled-up
crocks" and dark outsiders" may floor the most distinguished
members of the Equine Peerage. But now listen to the minstrel,

But the son of a devote I '11 link with a taint.
There it is, my lords and gentlemen, the secret ia as surely

table are always thankfully received by
Your indigent servitor, DARBY JONES.
P.S.—Hope you pulled off my good thing at Kempton, on
Saturday. It was apricot jam on thin bread and butter.

Miss WEE-WISE, who was so overwhelmed by the compliment
that she entreated for it to be cooked and eaten instanier.
As soon as I have recovered a missing link of my fishing-rod
(which it seems has bgen overlooked by Mister Pawnbroker),
and when I have procured some suitable bait, &c., it is my
intention to catch a fine salmon out of the burn for my en-
chanting divinity, and, as I place the fish in her lily-like hands,
to strike iron while it k hot and make her the formal proposal
of matrimony.
Mister Спим, hearing of my piscatorial ambitions, has, with
almost incredible simplicity, offered to lend me his salmon rod,
with a volume of flies, little suspecting that he will be assisting
me to catch two fish upon one hook! I am immensely tickled
by such a tip-top joke, and can scarcely refrain from imparting
it to Miss WEE-WKK herself, though I shall wait until I have
first secured the salmon.
I had some valuable remarks upon Scottish idioms and
linguistic peculiarities, &c., but these, of course, are to be
suppressed sine die—unless I am to be permitted to overflow
into a special supplement.

HONOUKBD SIR,—The mystic veil, which is invariably thrown
by cruel Fortune over the result of a big handicap, shall, if pos-
sible, be rent asunder by the old and ever ready seer, whose eye
has lost none of its Rontgen-ray penetration. As you are well
aware, Sir, it is at this time of year that many owners, to say
nothing of backers, are anxious to provide themselves with
a copious supply of winter keep, and thus it is that "bottled-up
crocks" and ' dark outsiders" may floor the most distinguished
members of the Equine Peerage. But now listen to the minstrel,
who lays the oof-bird's egg : —
Oh, beware of the Captain, in seeking one—
two,
He 'e a bad 'un to bent with hie port full iii
view.
Then the Count is л stayer that none can
deny,
Though to get newly rick someone else means
to try.
O'er a Jíendal-bred dann there are many who
gush,
But there 're others who know what will come
with a ruth.
I 've respect for the son of a pit-owning
peer,
And the guard in the van is a person to
fear.
Of a chat by the way I am somewhat afraid,
And look out for French tricks in the harle-
quinade.
The chance of a Cyprian coup is too faint;
But the eon of a devote I '11 link with a saint.
There it is, my lords and gentlemen, the secret ie as surely
discovered as was TYNAN at Boulogne. Cheques from grateful
clients may, as usual, be uncrossed, and postal orders are ac-
cepted. This latter tip may not be lost upon you, honoured Sir,
who have been, I learn, paying a fabulous price for rooms in
Paris during the visit of the CZAR. Crumbs from your sybarite
table are always thankfully received by
Your indigent servitor, DARBY JONES.
P.S.—Hope you pulled off my good thing at Kempton, on
Saturday. It was apricot jam on thin bread and butter.
[We do not know to what D. J. alludes. Two hours after the Duke of
York Stakes had been decided, we received a telegram from JONES asking ue
to bnck the wiimer for him.—ED.]

FACILIS DESCENSUS.
OUR dear little Bishop has bought a new bike,
Nor recks what the world may say,
Over hill and down dale, past hedge-row and dyke,
He merrily pedals his way.

When to visit his vicars on Sundays he goes,
To appearance he tries to take heed,
But the one thing he loves is to tuck up his toes
And fly down a hill at full speed.
He can dp thirty miles without turning a hair,
Yet he isn't much given to boasting,
"In the joys of the wheel," he will often declare,
"There is nothing can come up to coasting!"
And all of his cjergy are going in now
To follow "his lordship's" lead;
They 're biking and triking, but none, I avow,
Can develop the same turn of speed.
Some day, I Ve no doubt—his limbs are so supple—
He '11 go for some record or race;
I '11 be bound that he '11 win, if he gete a fast couple
Of curates for making the pace.

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
MONSIEUR Ki/кдк BLAZE ON "LE CHASSEUR AU CHIEN D'AKRÈT."
ONE of those insular prejudices which cause our nation to be
so justly beloved over the continent of Europe will have it that
we alone understand sport, and that in particular the French are
natural fools in this department of human activity. The ordi-
nary Briton as he misses his driven partridge or his rocketing
pheasant, thinks with contempt of the unfortunate French
nation which, as he imagines, knows no more about the handling
of a gun or tho proper destruction of a bird on the wing than
it does about those great feasts of sirloin and steak which, in
conjunction with their pale ale, have made Englishmen what they
are. In face of this prejudice, it seems almost unreasonable to
point out that at the present time there are probably more
Frenchman than Englishmen who are passionately devoted to the
sport of shooting, and that some of the best treatises on that
sport have been written in French.
IT must be conceded, of course, that there are some French-
men who have done their best to pour ridicule on the sporting
proclivities of their countrymen. Did not the immortal TAR-
TARIN set out from Tarascón every Sunday morning in order to
indulge in La Chaste aux Casquettes? Winged gaine being scarce
in the neighbourhood of Tarascón, a cap was thrown into the
air as a substituto, and the sportsman who recorded the greatest
number of hita, was, at the end of the day, saluted as champion
and escorted in triumph back to the town. Still, a cloth cap is
probably just as good to shoot at and as hard to hit as the terra-
cotta saucer which provides sport and championship cups to our
own "inanimate bird shooters," of whose powers and markman-
ship I occasionally read glowing accounts in our sporting papers.
I WONDER how many Englishmen have heard of Monsieur
ELZEAR BLAZE and his treatise on Le Chasseur au Chien d'Arrft.
I have the fourth edition, which was published in 1864, and is
adorned with a frontispiece representing a gentleman with a
glass at a shop window in which are displayed all kinds of cukes,
jellies, fruits, and other culinary delicacies. This may be ex-
plained by the fact that the book was published " au Dépôt de la
Collection Culinaire de Carême," and that this edition of it
forms part of a series in which, seemingly, Classiques de la Table,
'ces écrite étincelaiits de MM. BRILLAT SAVAJIIN, Cussr, DE
LARBYNIBRB, BBRCHODX, &c.," also appeared. This, however,
is quit« in our English manner, for does not every volume
of Ji'ur and Feather, our latest sporting series, contain a chapter
on cookery P
IT is impossible to wish for a more agreeable companion than
M. ELZEAR BLAZE. His publisher, in a Preface, justly remarks
"Que de gaieté, de verve, de traits incisifs, d'anecdotes semées
dans ces récite piquante de M. ELZEAR BLAZE! que d'aimables
peintures de la campagne, des bois, des courses à pied I Quelle
animation dans cette vie que sa spirituelle plume a si bien
retracée." Indeed, there is nothing stodgy or dull about the
treatise of M. BLAZE. It is written in a style which is through-
out crisp and agreeable, and his advice to novices, even when it
is most paternal, never degenerates into pomposity. Here is
an extract from Chapter III., entitled, "Habillement du Chas-
seur." "In order to disguise themselves as sportsmen," says
M. BLAZE, "our dandies stop at nothing. Like coquettish
women, they have their négligés, which cost more than ball
dresses, and they wear these in the hope that the ladies who see
them will lose their repose and their appetite, that their com-
plexions will pale, that possibly they will die of it, a thing that
happens every day, as we all know. And then, when.they have
seen the ravages caused by their costume, when a wan and leaden
colour has succeeded to the rosy tint on two beautiful cheeks,
then these gentlemen triumph. Oh, the scoundrels I Poor
women, I pity you I Those who are most beautifully dressed for
shooting are always the least skilful. The handsomest game-
bags are always nearly empty. I affirm this as the result of
constant observation." This chapter contains some admirably
sound advice as to shooting costume, and winds up in true French
style with some reflections on the style of dress that best fits a
man to win the affections of his lady-love, and the conversation
which is best calculated to charm her. "Relate to her, here
and there," says our author, quoting a friend of great ex-
perience, "some adventure in which you have miracu-
lously escaped death. If you have no adventure, manu-
facture one. Suppose you got up at twelve o'clock, what does
it matter P Tell her that you have spent the whole morning
on your horse in order to school him, a matter of the utmost
difficulty, seeing that the horse is ungovernable. Your beast
scarcely ever goes beyond a walk, and can only be induced to
trot by the aid of your whip. Never mind! tell her that it has
been playing you tricks. Season your story with many details.
Embroider, always embroider; and endeavour to make her believe
that any man except yourself would have been unseated."
HERE, for the present, I must leave M. BLAZE, but I hope to
take him up again next week.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
IN Sir George Tressady (8штн, ELDER, <fe Co.), Mrs. HUMPHRY
WARD has dealt in masterful manner with a difficult task. She has
for her dramatis person« appropriated contemporary personages,
and has avoided personalities. My Baronite knows (or thinks
he knows) the principal people who move through this story. Yet
so cunningly are the colours mixed, so deftly is a left hand
moulded on a figure where one is looking for the familiar right,
that Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD is justified in regarding with inno-
cent stare of surprise any who label her puppets with other
names than those she pleases to hong round their necks. The
closest portraiture is that of Lord RANDOLPH CHURCHILL. In
physical details Mrs. WARD is careful to make Lord Fontenoy
unlike the original. But those personally acquainted with the
Leader of the Fourth Party, who ended by being Leader of the
House of Commons, recognize how faithful is the study. They
will remember a confession Lord RANDOLPH was rather fond of
making at a time when his intimate knowledge of public affairs
and his absolute command of the intricate forms of House of
Commons procedure were the marvel of mankind. He protested
that when he first embarked on political life he knew nothing.
"Absolutely nothing," he repeated, clenching one hand, and
twirling his moustache with the other. "You forget," says
Mrs. WARD'S Lord Fontenoy, in conversation with Sir George
Trusady, "that I learnt nothing either at school or college.
understand was a betting-book. I knew no history, except
what one gets from living among people who have been making
it. I could not understand the simplest economical argument,
and I hated trouble of all kinds. Nothing but the toil of a
galley slave could have enabled me to do what I have done."
There is our dear GIUNDOLPH to the life. One other portrait,
drawn with inimitable skill, is a pillar of the Liberal Party,
who, in the novel, is ticketed Lord Maxwell. Here, as in the
case of Lord Fontenoy and Lord RANDOLPH CHURCHILL, points
of physical identity are carefully eschewed. But there is the
earl in the grand simplicity of his private and public life. These
are merely sidelights on a novel cleverly constructed, admirably
written, abounding in human interest.
The Oxford University Press possesses, and liberally employs,
the art of endowing familiar books with fresh charm. Mr.
HENRY FROWDE has taken in hand the Poets, serving them up
in what Mr. GLADSTONE used to call three courses. There is an
edition of one volume, excellently printed, neatly bound, and
low priced. Another, printed upon Oxford India paper, hand-
somely bound, edges luxuriously gilt over red, costs more
money. Finally, comes a gem of bookbinders' and printers' art,
a miniature edition in vojumes suitable for storage in the waist-
coat pocket, yet printed in type that makes reading easy. The
Oxford SHAKSPBARE, SCOTT, LONGFELLOW, WORDSWORTH, and
BYRON, have already been issued. Now we have the Oxford BUBNS,
the whole poetical works of the ploughman, edited by Mr. Loon

first Sheet.—A Patch of Old France.
Montreuil, Monday.—A rare occasion on which STEBNE,
pursuing his Sentimental Journey, was inclined to make dis-
agreeable rejoinder, was when, standing at the remise door
in the coach-yard at Calais, the Inquisitive Traveller volunteered
the information that Amiens was on the road to Paris. If he
had not already snubbed the monk who came to beg alms, he
would certainly have snapped off the nose of his inconsequential
interlocutor.
Hope I sha'n't run the risk of being
snubbed if I observe that Montreuil is on
the road to Paris. As I Ve only recently
discovered the fact I venture to mention
it Hurrying by rail between Boulogne
and Paris, we pass Montreuil almost with-
in sight. Never look for it. Probably are
not aware of its existence, or have for-
gotten it. Yet it wae on the road to Paris
long before Plantagenet times, when King
EDWARD and the BLACK PRINCE ravaged
Northern France, won Crecy and Poictiers.
In quieter days, MART Queen of Scots,
journeying from Paris to Edinburgh, slept
a night at Montreuil.
Even more interesting is the fact that
LAURENCE STERNE halted here at an early
stage of his Sentimental Journey. "Mon-
truil" he spells it, which is near enough.
SARK and I are staying in the very hotel
at which YORICK put up, and where he en-
gaged LA FLEUR as body-servant. The
Hôtel de France has probably altered little
since the day when under its roof LA
FLEUR unpacked his new master's six
shirts and one pair of silk breeches. There
is nothing modern about the place, not
even blankets, as we discovered on the
first night of our sojourn. For all bed-
clothes there was a sheet, and over that a
wadded coverlet, weighing something less
than half-a-ton, hoary with age, impreg-
nated with the dust of centuries. Bath-
room, of course, not to be expected. But
in an hotel one does look for a sitting-room
of some kind, public or private. Those
were luxuries not known three hundred
years ago, when the hotel first opened its
doors to the passing stranger, and they
have not been superadded. Across the
courtyard, facing the kitchen, is a room
which serves for breakfast, lunch, dinner,
conversation, reading, and smoking. That
has for three centuries met the wayfarer's
need, and if at the end of the nineteenth'
he wants more he must go elsewhere.
When STERNE engaged LA FLEUR as his
body-servant on the famous journey
through France, he discovered that his
main qualifications for the post were that
he could beat a drum and make spatter-
dashes. MARIE, to-day the maid of all
work at the Hôtel de France, is as bound-
less in range of domestic capacity as LA
FLEUR was limited. She does every-
thing but cook. That important func-
tion is performed by the proprietress,
a lady born about the Waterloo year
wards with hands full, and having brought in the various dishes,
serves them round. The exceptional crowd of Saturday brings
no extraneous help. MARIE does it all, and we just wait a
little longer for our turn to come round.
"And do you get good wages?" SARK asked MARIE, finding
her filling up a spare moment by flushing and sweeping the stony
courtyard.
"Mais oui, m'tieur," said MARIE, proudly; "seize francs par
mois."
Sixteen francs a month SARK makes out to be something less
than £8 a year, and muses sadly over the details of his own
domestic establishment.
The best room in the hotel is the kitchen. If we might only

IN Sir George Tressady (8штн, ELDER, <fe Co.), Mrs. HUMPHRY
WARD has denlt in masterful manner with a difficult task. She has
for her dramatis personit appropriated contemporary personages,
and has avoided personalities. My Baronite knows (or thinks
he knows) the principal people who move through this story. Yet
so cunningly are the colours mixed, so deftly is a left hand
moulded on a figure where one is looking for the familiar right,
that Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD is justified in regarding with inno-
cent stare of surprise any who label her puppets with other
names than those she pleases to hang round their necks. The
closest portraiture is that of Lord RANDOLPH CHURCHILL. In
physical details Mrs. WARD is careful to make Lord Fontenoy
unlike the original. But those personally acquainted with the
Leader of the Fourth Party, who ended by being Leader of the
House of Commons, recognize how faithful is the study. They
will remember a confession Lord RANDOLPH was rather fond of
making at a time when his intimate knowledge of public affairs
and his absolute command of the intricate forms of House of
Commons procedure were the marvel of mankind. He protested
that when he first embarked on political life he knew nothing.
"Absolutely nothing," he repeated, clenching one hand, and
twirling his moustache with the other. "You forget," says
Mrs. WARD'S Lord Fontenoy, in conversation with Sir George
Tressady, "that I learnt nothing either at school or college.
understand was a betting-book. I knew no history, except
what one gets from living among people who have been making
it. I coulil not understand the simplest economical argument,
and I hated trouble of all kinds. Nothing but the toil of a
galley slave could have enabled me to do what I have done."
There is our dear GRANDOLPH to the life. One other portrait,
drawn with inimitable skill, is a pillar of the Liberal Party,
who, in the novel, is ticketed Lord Maxwell. Here, as in the
case of Lord- Fontenoy and Lord RANDOLPH CHURCHILL, points
of physical identity are carefully eschewed. But there is the
earl in the grand simplicity of his private and public life. These
are merely sidelights on a novel cleverly constructed, admirably
written, abounding in human interest.
The Oxford University Press possesses, and liberally employs,
the art of endowing familiar books with fresh charm. Mr.
HENRY FROWDE has taken in hand the Poets, serving them up
in what Mr. GLADSTONE used to call three courses. There is an
edition of one volume, excellently printed, neatly bound, and
low priced. Another, printed upon Oxford India paper, hand-
somely bound, edges luxuriously gilt over red, costa more
money. Finally, comee a gem of bookbinders' and printers' art,
a miniature edition in volumes suitable for storage in the waist-
coat pocket, yet printed in type that makes reading easy. The
Oxford SHAKSPEARB. SCOTT, LONGFELLOW, WORDSWORTH, and

EXTRACTS уком THE TRAVBL DIARY or TOIIY, М.Г.
First Sheet.—A Patch of Old France.
Montreuil, Monday.-—A rare occasion on which STERNE,
pursuing his Sentimental Journey, was inclined to make dis-
agreeable rejoinder, was when, standing at the remise door
in the coach-yard at Calais, the Inquisitive Traveller volunteered
the information that Amiens was on the road to Paris. If he
had not already snubbed the monk who came to beg alms, he
would certainly have snapped off the nose of his inconsequential
interlocutor.
Hope I sha'n't run the risk of being
snubbed if I observe that Montreuil is on
the road to Paris. As I've only recently
discovered the fact I venture to mention
it Hurrying by rail between Boulogne
and Paris, we pass Montreuil almost with-
in sight. Never look for it. Probably are
not aware of its existence, or have for-
gotten it. Yet it was on the road to Paris
long before Plantagenet times, when King
EDWARD and the BLACK PRINCB ravaged
Northern France, won Crecy and Poictiers.
In quieter days, MART Queen of Scots,
journeying from Paris to Edinburgh, slept
a night at Montreuil.
Even more interesting is the fact that
LAURENCE STERNE halted here at an early
stage of his Sentimental Journey. "Mon-
truil" he spells it, which is near enough.
S.VHK and I are staying in the very hotel
at which YOBICK put up, and where he en-
gaged LA FLEUR as body-servant. The
Hôtel de France has probably altered little
since the day when under its roof LA
FLEUR unpacked his new master's six
shirts and one pair of silk breeches. There
is nothing modern about the place, not
even blankets, as we discovered on the
first night of our sojourn. For all bed-
clothes there was a sheet, and over that a
wadded coverlet, weighing something less
than half-a-ton, hoary with age, impreg-
nated with the dust of centuries. Bath-
room, of course, not to be expected. But
in an hotel one does look for a sitting-room
of some kind, public or private. Those
were luxuries not known three hundred
years ago, when the hotel first opened its
doors to the passing stranger, and they
have not been superadded. Across the
courtyard, facing the kitchen, is a room
which serves for breakfast, lunch, dinner,
conversation, reading, and smoking. That
has for three centuries met the wayfarer's
need, and if at the end of the nineteenth
he wants more he must go elsewhere.
When STERNE engaged LA FLEUR as his
body-servant on the famous journey
through France, he discovered that his
main qualifications for the post were that
he could beat a drum and make spatter-
dashes. M ли IK, to-day the maid of all
work at the Hôtel de France, is as bound-
less in range of domestic capacity as LA
FI.EUR was limited. She does every-
thing but cook. That important func-
tion is performed by the proprietress,
a lady born about the Waterloo year, with a profile
curiously reminiscent of DANTE, a nice turn for making an
omelette, and perfect inspiration in concocting Potage à la
bonne femme. MARIE does everything else. Is head waiter,
only chambermaid, and, I suspect, secretly performs the func-
tions of boots.
On Saturday, being market day, there is a midday meal called
by nous outres an ordinary. Farmers flocking in from the
country side crowd the long table. It seems an impossible
thing that MARIK should bring in and serve to the six or eight
people living in the hotel the successive courses of dejeuner
and dinner. The difficulty is added to by the facts that, wet or
shine, the dishes have to be carried across the court-yard, and
trays, being a modern invention, have not yet been included
wards with hands full, and having brought in the various dishes,
serves them round. The exceptional crowd of Saturday brings
no extraneous help. MARIE does it all, and we just wait a
little longer for our turn to come round.
"And do you get good wages?" SARK asked MARIE, finding
her filling up a spare moment by flushing and sweeping the stony
courtyard.
"Mois out, m'sieur," said MARIE, proudly; "seize francs par
mois."
Sixteen francs a month SARK makes out to be something less
than £8 a year, and muses sadly over the details of his own
domestic establishment.
The bi'st room in the hotel is the kitchen. If we might only

you can trace the beautiful stone work of a window, filled up
with heartrending bricks and mortar. The population also
seems to have been shot away. Save on market day there is a
prevailing ghastly emptiness about the streets.
The glory of Montreuil at the end of these many centuries
is its imperishable walls. High up the town stands, jutting
suddenly out of the plain of Picardy. Le bon Dieu made the
mound, some two miles in circumference. Le Diable enclosed it
within walls, made it a place of arms, round which armies have
struggled since the days of PHILIPPE of Anjou. Here and there
the outer case of the wall is crumbling. Its broad moat is a
fat fruit garden. Like another decayed warrior, Montreuil's
helmet is now a hive for bees. Its lance is broken. Its sword
is rust. But the massive walls still frown on the peaceful
valley, as they did when HENRY THE FIFTH rode by them on
his way to Agincourt, and when, nearly four centuries later,
LAURENCE STERNE passed out of the gateway to come upon the
dead ass at Nampont.
AUGUSTE EN ANGLETERRE.
BRIGHTON.
DEAR MISTER,—I hasten myself to tell to you the excellent
idea of my brother JULES. He has written to me from Marseille,
where finds himself his regiment in this moment here. He is
captain, the brave boy. Eh well, he writes to me that, having
studied the english language au fond, and being now in voyage
in boy—ere garçon—I should to write a guide for my compatriots,
who visit the England. La bonne idée! En voyage, en garfon.
Enfin enchanté!
Therefore, I propose to myself, Mister Punch, to visit some
ones of the towns of your country, above all the towns fre-
quented by the strangers. I will write my notes, and of time
in time—de temps en temps—I will send you of them. Only,
seen that I am neither géographe nor literator; these notes will be
but the first impressions of a stranger—the instantaneous blow
of the eye of a voyage of agreement.
He arrives by hazard that I receive the letter of JULES at
Brighton. It is an excellent occasion of to commence my notes.
I have already spoken of some parts of the town. To-day, I
visit the jetty, the "Ouestpir." It is not bad. In effect one
could to walk himself there with much of agreement, if only the
air was calm. Ah but, this wind of Brighton! On the jetty I
find him insupportable. Therefore I go myself away, and after
a little walk towards the west I arrive to some pelouses in the
town of Hove, where an assembly of persons very well put, Mi-
bien mise», walk themsejves around of a military music. It w
not excessively gay, but it is very as he must, très comme il faut,
and absolutely correct. Again, if the air was calm! But by a
such wind, holding firmly his hat, Ьоизс-idé, almost bouleversé, is
it that even an English can to be absolutely correct? The hurri-
canes of Brighton can even to disturb the calm of your com-
patriots. And of same the hurricanes of Hove. For the two
towns, which have the air of to be one sole, have nothing in
common, except the air—the hurricanes. I have heard to
speak of the quarrels between the two, veritable storms in a
cup of tea. All lately the english journals tell us how many
hours of sun there has had at Brighton, as at Westminster. It
astonishes me that the duration of bright sun at Hove is not
registered separately. It is incredible that two towns, thus
divided, should share one record of sun. He want« of it two
Above all at present, when one sees almost not one sole ray of
sun either at Brighton or at Hove!
While that I hear the music, suddenly the rain rebegins. And
see there all the ladys and misses, so well dressed in robes so
gay and so charming, are obliged of to run, to throw themselves
into the lugubrious interior of the "fly" of Brighton—ah no,
of Hove, but it is the same thing!—and in fine when there are
no more of " flys" to seek a shelter at the door of a house. And
in England you have not the coach door, la porte cochère, and j
by consequence there is not much of shelter. Me also, having
yielded to some ladys the " fly" which I had caueht, I refuge my-
self under a portal. It is a droll of road at Hove, two roads,
twins, separated by railings of iron. At Brighton there is one
wide road at border of the sea, but at Hove there is of them two.
They love the railings of iron at Hove. They are very droll and
very stupid, those railings there. But in fine perhaps I prefer
Hove, although the grass grows in the deserted avenues so
ridiculously wide. At least one finds not there a melancholy
Campo Santo in cast-iron, or a ruined jetty, as at Brighton.
That evening there I resolve to make le lendemain a little ex-
cursion outside of the town. I regard my map and the journal.

A POSER.

"I? I 'D GIVE IT UP AND START A GOLF CLUB!"
by blue! Ah non, merci! The remembrance of the traversy
from Calais to Dovers suffices me. There is some excursions in
bicycle. Again, no! There is for that too much of wind and
too much of rain. It rains, as one says in english, the cats and
the dogs. It is therefore very appropriate that I see now the
announces of a "Dog Show." It wants but an exhibition of
cats for to show us all that which has fallen from the sky. Then
there is some excursions to a certain place called the "Devil's
Dyke," a hole in the hills. But how a hole can he to be a dyke,
une digue? It is an error. It wishes to say " Devil's Dig," that
which the devil has dug, creusé. Eh well, is it that he is worth
the pain of to make a voyage on the hills, in a "fly" of Brighton,
by a such wind, for to see a hole, even a great hole? Again,
no! Ça ne vaut pas le diable!
In fine thé excursions in railway. If I was at Nice, and that
he was falling of the rain so continually—that which would be
impossible at Nice—I would file, filerais, direct upon Monte
Carlo. It is not that I love the play, for I lose alldays, but in
fine I amuse myself to regard the players, and if one loses a
loui.i—eh well, one is not ruined! But near to Brighton one
finds not a Monte Carlo. Tiens! See there on the map a town,
at almost the same distance, also on the sea, Vorting. No,
Worhthing. Parfaitement! C'est bien ça, that is well that. To-
morrow to Worhthing. Agree, «fee., AUGUSTE.

A WALLED TOWN.
EXTRACTS FBOM THE TRAVEL DIARY OF ТОВУ, M.P.
PAGE II.—A Blotch of Modern France.
Montreuil, Monday.—Standing on the walls when the sun
has gone down, looking westward, one catches sight, on far
horizon, of a couple of lights, so near together that, to SARK'S
fanciful mind, they suggest the eyes of a tiger watching us
through the gloom. They are, in truth, the beams of the twin
lighthouses on the coast by the mouth of the Canche. AVhy two,

Le Sportsman.
no one knows. There is nothing like them on any coast. Apart
from duality, they are cosily built, well inshore. Instead of
their base being sea-washed they are set in pleasant gardens,
where are grown the best pears for milea round.
Between them and the sea there is space for a watering-place.
Parie-Plage it is called. VILLEMESSANT, the creator of the
Paris Figaro, gave it this name, and it has stuck ever since.
Good Parisians before they die buy a patch of sandy soil near
the twin lighthouses, and build their souls a lordly pleasure-
liouse. These are, for the most part, fantastic monstrosities, the
structure budding forth in all kinds of excrescences. Balconies
that will hold nobody; pillars that uphold nothing; towera so
unwieldy as to threaten to bring the whole building down; bits
of coloured glass wherever they can be stuck. Each propriétaire
further shows his independence by building bis house at an angle
obtrusively comer-wise to his neighbour's. The general effect
is aa if the ginger-bread contrivances had been shaken out of a
Brobdingnagian pepper-box, and left where they had fallen. But
they please their owners, and that, after all, is their main
object.
Moniteur, Madame, et Bébé come down in the season, bathe
and brown, and believe they are having a high old time. Some
of them are mighty Nimrods. When I was last here, in the
summertime, I was much struck with a Monsieur who strolled
about the place from morn till eve armed cap-a-pie for la chasse.
A gun was slung round his shoulder. A warlike belt, scarce
concealing a liberal supply of cartridges, girt his portly waist.
He wore a velvet coat and waistcoat, corduroy trousers, thick-
soled boots, and a very large bag to bring home his game.
As far as close observation went, he never shot anything,not even
the postman. When he was not drinking petits verres or smoking
cigarettes in front of the café, he haunted the beach, sometimes
going down to the water's edge. This suggested to me at the
time the suspicion that he shot shrimps.
By chance, to-day, his secret was disclosed. Walking through
the pine-woods at the back of Paris-Plage, we came upon a small
clearing. At one side of it was what, at first sight, looked like
the top of a well. There was a wooden cover, some three feet
broad by five long. This, we learned, was our gallant chasseur's
happy hunting ground. Hither he came, in the gloaming 01
early morning, with hie game-bag half full of succulent cabbage
leaves. These he spread about at the further edge of the clear-
ing. Then, with stealthy step, he withdrew to the wooden box,
lifted up the lid, and dropped into a carefully-dug pit, closing
the lid upon himself.
"For all the world." SABK says, "like IRVING doing lachimo
in Imogen's bedroom.
The front part of the lid does not close level with the ground,
thus not only supplying the sportsman with light and air, but
leaving loophole through which the muzzle of the gun projects.
Presently the rabbits come to feed on the cabbage-leaves, and the
noble sportsman lets fly.
Ali, le beau sport! Here is its sublimation. SARK, like the
late TROCHTJ, has a plan. He notices that the padlock
lies on the top of the lid. Good. Next season he will repair
to Paris-Plage, will stalk the noble sportsman. When he
has settled himself in his pit and pulled down the lid, SARK will
advance on tip-toe from the wood behind, will quietly turn the
key in the padlock, and will withdraw, leaving the noble sports-
man to enjoy an unexpectedly prolonged opportunity of making
a bag.
In the meantime, SARK does not want the thing mentioned.
Premature disclosure of the plan might prove destructive of its
full success.

MISS TWIDDY ON MODERN SHYNESS.
[The Daily Telegraph has " opened ite columns" to a diacussioQ_upon the
startling question " Why are_People Shy,?/']
DEAR MISTER PUNCH,—I 'm confident an error worse than clerical
Has crept into the statement of this interrogatory.
l'm shy; I always have been, to the verge of the hysterical,
Which I was taught, x years ago, was a young maiden's
glory.
I'm hushful, and I'm blushful, as I was when young and
mittenish,—
For mittens in my girlhood were the ensigns of the modest
ones,—•
But now that all the maids seem fast and all the matrons
kittenish,
This query strikes me, truly, as the oddest of the oddest ones!
My sainted mother taught me a Mimosa-like timidity
Was maidenhood's bewitchingest, most captivating quality;
But now it seems regarded as the height of insipidity,
And rigorously excluded from the scheme of virgin polity.
To blush, to lower eyelids, and to twiddle with one's toes abouf
The pattern of the carpet in a fashion feebly fluttery,
Is now a mark of mawkishness that nothing useful knows about.
The stamp of school-girl silliness absurd and bread-and-buttery.
.Voir girls are bold as—brass knobs, and as cool as any icicle.
To ask why they axe shy, then, these young "misses" imper-
turbable
Who smoke, and put on knickers—oh!!!—and, yes, bestride a
bicycle,
And are, in short, emancipate, smart, up-to-date, uncurbable,
Is really most preposterous 1 As well ask why a porcupine
Is sleek and saponaceous! If you share the modern girlishness,
To emulate the masculine in play as well as work you pine,
In billiards as in business, evening "nips," and early-purl-
ishnessl
Shy? Goodness gracious!—Only they've small goodness and
scant graciousness,
These girls, whose "naked egos" are now advertised ob-
trusively—
That's a "psychologic phrase," although suggestive of "owda-
ciousness"
To those whose early training left them "ladylike" ex-
clusively—
Amidst the modes and phrases, manly customs, unsexed crazes,
Of—my nieces and their "she-pals." I feel "shy," and even
giddy;
But to apply that word to tliem—as poeta do to daisies—
Fits—well, like "up-to-date" applied to, Yours,
MATILDA TWIDDY.

HONOURED SIB,—Was I right over the Cesarewitch or was I

readers not now rolling in gold or are they not? These three

Sir, in giving them St. Bris I laid low, but came out at ten
to one. Is there any prophet in the United Kingdom, who
could boast of the same record P I am well assured that not um

self, mistrusting the advice of some gutter-snipe of the turf, did
not plank your hard-earned doubloons on a rank impostor like
1'hcebas Apollo, a disreputable towel-horse, whom I never even
named in my diplomatic despatch to your Napoleonic columns.
But my second string, Piety, was fourth, and under other circum-
stances might have run third. I was truly glad to see the
Prince of WALES in time to salute the Ditch—"Ditch dien"
ought to be H.R.H.'e motto—Lord ItosKiimtv seemed
none the worse for his discrepancy (a political word of mine
own) with the Ill-Liberal party. The Duke of WESTMINSTER,
despite the coloured collars, which he insists upon wearing like
the late Duke of HAMILTON, is always above the dead level of
Armenian atrocities, and made the Duke of CAMBRIDGE smile
with his anecdotes of Rampion, who would not take his little
bit between his teeth for the Duke of York Stake« at Kempton
Park.
Newmarket always reminds me of the Маге at Hampton
Court. You never know where the races beprin or end. I love

FOR a clearly-told and alluringly-excit-

WARDEN'S 1 nn by tlu¡ Шюге, published by I

commended. The locality of the incidents |
will be recognised at once by any one ac-
quainted with that portion of the south-
east coast where grazing fields, lying be-
tween the monotonous road and the sea,
are gradually merged into such extensive
flats of sand and grass, varied by occa-
sional undulations, as delight the heart
and exercise the muscles of the deter-
mined golfer. The heroine is a charm-
ingly puzzling personage, who so gains
upon the honest reader's sympathy as to
make him hope against hope that she will
ultimately escape from what appears to be
the just retribution awaiting her crimes.
Whether that sympathy is deserved, or
wasted, it is for the authoress to tell, and
the reader to discover. Should any of the
BARON'S friends, anxious for a day s quiet,
seek any place in this, or any other, neigh-
bourhood close to the melancholy ocean,
he will not do better than to make the ac-
quaintance of FLORENCE WARDEN'S Inn by
the Shore, where there is as good enter-
tainment to be had as the most hungry
novel-devourer could desire.

galloping, romance entitled A Puritan'»

capital drawings are of this size. It is
such a Romance of Multitude, a regular

it is clean), sword-thrusting, fisticuffing,
brawling, plunging, lunging, struggling,
guggling, half-drowning, with success-
crowning-everything romance, as Master
MAX and not a few other writers,—he of
the Golden Spur, for example,—love to
write. Odds bucklers and carbines! but
it needs all the relief that the love story
of a gentle girl can give to the tale, in
order that we may have a few moments'
lull. The heroine is an oppressed,
thwarted, but ever ready-witted damsel,
and though she gives the name of Л
Puritan's Wife to the novel, herself play-
ing the "title role," yet is her part not so
prominent aa is that of the Puritan wife's
Puritan husband; nor, indeed, is she so
much in evidence as are the friends and
enemies of the Puritan wife's Puritan hus-
band. But, Messieurs the romance

And the uses of the globes, as was my

But all they 'II learn from me
Is to ride the iron gee—
All other lessons utterly disgust 'em!
The girls no more will meddle
With the painful piano-pedal,
They'll only touch the pedal of their

Like their grannies, they begin
At an early age to " spin,"
But the road it is their spinning-wheels

MUSICAL NOTES.
[" The bagpipe threatens to be a fashionable in-
strument in London this winter."—Daily Л'с«'«.]
CERTAINLY the reproach sometimes
urged against us that we are an unmusical
nation is in a fair way to become obsolete.
The number of concerts given this winter
beats all previous records, and most of the
music performed, whether by professionals
or amateurs, is of the very highest class.
UN Thursday, for instance, at Lady
CLAPPBRCLAW'S soirée musicale, the or-
chestra of amateur bagpipe-players distin-
guished themselves greatly. The orchestra
consists of twenty-seven members, and the
drawing-room at Clapperclaw House is

fortunately ми.ill, во that the effect
gained was simply stupendous. A few of
the audience thought that the fortissimos
were almost overdone, but these were cap-
tious persons who had forgotten to place
cotton-wool in their ears, an elementary
precaution always to be observed before
attending a modern concert. On the
other hand, a distinguished foreign mu-
sician was overheard to remark with great
emphasis that no such performance was
even possible in his own country.
A FEATURE of the Duchess of MARGATE'S
reception on Saturday was the magnificent
trombone-playing of Miss ALAMODE. This
talented young lady played with such suc-
cess that all the electric-light globes in
the room were shattered, and several of
the audience were deafened for life.
Charmingly pathetic, too, was Herr
THUMPOFFBKY'S solo on the big drum;
indeed, tears stood in many eyes at the
conclusion of his performance.
Now that the older musical instruments
are falling into well-deserved neglect, it
is interesting to find how readily well-
known artistes move with the times.
Señor SARASATE'B penny-whistle recitals
have been crowded, and there is sure to
be a full house at his next concert, when
he will play the whole of Don Giovanni
on that delightful instrument. Not to be
outdone, on the following day Herr JOA-
CHIM will render the overture to Tann-
häuser and the choral symphony with the
assistance only of a small comb.
AMONGST the new music recently pub-
lished we would especially commend a
volume of Twelve Morceaux for the Bones,
are provided also with a tambourine obbli-
gato, and The Wanderer's Return, a
stately triumphal march, specially written
by Doctor HUBERT PARRY tor performance
on a latchkey. Sir ALEXANDER MACKEN-
ZIE'S new work, Israel's Lament, a sym-
phonic overture arranged for an orchestra
of Jew's harps, will be produced, we
understand, at the next Birmingham
Festival.
MANY complaints have lately been made
of the unsatisfactory character of the
Dictionaries of Music now in use, which
supply hardly any information as to the
musical instrumente of the day. How-
ever, this ignorance will be partly reme-
died for those who attend Professor
BRIDGE'S historical lectures, which are
doing a great work for the musical edu-
cation of the public. The next course will
begin on Monday week, and will deal with
•' The Structure and Development of the
Barrel-organ." The lectures will be illus-
trated by performances on the instrument
under discussion, given by M. PADEREWSKI,
Herr H« ШЕЛТИ AI., and others.
CONDENSED CONFIDENCE.
(For Ladies only.)
DEAREST ETHELINDA,— "On ne badine
pas avec L'amour," says AI.FRKD DB MUS-
SET. Ahí how regretfully do I recognise
the truth of the poet's adage. When I
recently told you of the capture of poor
Lord ARTHUR RANTIPOLB at the Spa of
Scarborough by the female who is unhap-
pily privileged to call herself his wife, 1
mentioned that the unlucky fellow was re-
duced from leonine resentment to sheep-
like docility by the mere mention of the
name "Jonee." Which JON ES P Aided
by an astute employé of Mr. ROPES-
BNB, the celebrated private detective,
I have discovered that this JONES
(I might say, our JONES) is a betting
man with whom ARTHUR has been
rash enough to plunge into turf
speculations, naturally to his financial
embarrassment. The FEMALE (I can
call her nothing else) having discovered
this fatal secret, ingratiated nerself with
the man JONES (probably he is a blood re-
lation), and, whenever in want of funds,
she has produced him like a god out of a
bathing-machine, as some Latin author
remarks, to his temporary discomfiture.
Talking of bathing-machines reminds me
that an admirable substitute for soap is a
mixture of cigar ashes and crushed apples,
which I have registered under the title of
"Pom-Nic." Demand it at all confec-
tioners and bookstalls.
Mr. ROPRSEND, who served with distinc-
tion in the Peruvian army, says that
JONES is as hard as a Brazil nut—by the
way, I can give you an excellent receipt
for a puree of Brazil nuts, and will do so
later—and that, if ARTHUR does not settle
his liability, he means to have "his lord-
ship warned off every course in Christen-
dom." This sounds like an Armenian
atrocity—but I gather that unless the sum
of £2,660 is paid to this implacable JONES,
my hero will have te suffer peine forte et
dure. This must not be, and so, like an-
other JOAN OF ARC, I have resolved to
sacrifice my little fortune (left me, you
will remember, by my godmother, Lady
POKESDOWN), for the rescue of my GUY
LIVINGSTONE. JOAN v. JONES. Mr.
ROPESEND says that I am behaving like a
real lady, but his praises fall from my ears
widgeon. A propos of widgeon, roast it
with cayenne and onions, stir gently into
beetroot sauce, caviare, lemons, and three
ounces of delicate fresh-herring-roe jelly,
and serve hot, with capers to follow.
ROPESEND also states that I must not see
ARTHUR, who ia (I again quote his lan-
guage) lying doggo, having (Dieu soit
béni!) escaped momentarily the persecu-
tion and presence of JONES and the FE-
II.M.K. In my conduct I know that I am
both wicked and immoral, but que voulez-
vous? I shall earn the praise of GRANT
ALLEN and SARAH GRAND.
I will let you know how my scheme
•'pans out" (dear ARTHUR'S expression).
We have moved into a new flat, and I
must say that the Art wall-paper in my

bouduir, illustrating MACAULAY'S Lays of
Ancient Borne, is worthy of WALTER
CRANE. It can only be obtained from—*

TUE Musió HALL LICENCES.—According
to the report in the papers last Thursday,
Mr. COOTE (surely not the representative
of the musical Соотв family, of the
"Соотв and TINNEY" band, which it was
most unfair ever to term "Tinney," being
"strings and wind ") opposed the licence
for which the Palace Music Hall had ap-
plied. Coûte eue coûte he was determined
to oppose it, was Соотв; and ultimately,
when granting the licence, our unfortu-
nate Соотв was actually told by the
Chairman how they, the magistrates,
through him, their chief, regretted he
(СоотЕ) should ever have expressed his
strong opinion against the living tableau
illustrating "La Source." Who can ob-
ject to nuda veritast Ladies and gentle-
men visiting the Empire find no fault with
"La Source." And what is "La Source
for the Goose is La Source for the Gan-
der." So why complain?

ON THE THAMES.
DEAB MISTER,—I am not gone to Worhthing, for the day
where I wrote to you I received a letter from one of my friends,
who inhabits Goring, inviting me of to render him visit, there
where I could see the Thames. Ah, the fine occasion for to
make some notes for my guide 1 I have already seen the Thames
at London, at Richmond, and at the Lock of Boultaire. Ah, how
it is gay the Sunday—even the english Sunday—that to see to
pass all the adorable misses and the brave misters by the Lock
of Boultaire! But until here I know not Goring.
Therefore very volontiers, volunteerly, I make my mail—je
fais ma malle—the morning, I go to the station. I make to put
an etiquette for Goring on my baggages, and I demand if there
is a train direct. The factor—facteur—responds that yes.
Then I obtain a ticket of to go and return, and I part in the
train for Goring.
After a time incredibly short, in arriving at a station, I find
that it is already Goring. A la bonne heure! Very content of
to arrive so quick, I descend and I seek my friend, whom I will
name Mister X. He is not there. Eh well, it is equal to me,
something has prevented him, j'irai chez lui, I shall go at him.
So I demand it Mister X.. has sent a carriage. The factor says
that no. Then I demand where lives Mister X. The factor
knows not the name. Nor another employed no more. Nor
the coacher of a fly. Nor the chief of station. In fine I seek
the letter of my friend, and I show to them his name. "Ah."
they cry themselves all, "that is Goring on Thames I" "Eh
well," I say. "and what is this that this is that that P" "This
is Goring, Sussei," respond they. After some time I compre-
hend that there is two Gorings, and that this one here is not
that one there, the Goring of my friend, and—name of a dog !—
in fine I return to Brighton, and I go to London to the station
of Victoria, and I traverse London to the station of Padington,
and at Padington I entrap the last train, and, all épuiié, I
arrive to the other Goring after a voyage or the most longs and
of the most annoyings—ennuyants—a voyage of all the day
in omnibus trains. And this by a cold, ah but, a cold I
find that Goring is enough pretty, even when the season of the
canoeing, canotage, is passed. It is true that one sees not the
adorable misses and the ravishing colours of their robes of
summer, but en revanche, in revenge, one sees the beautiful
tints of the leaves of autumn, red and yellow, on the hill of
St ritly. She is very well situated, the hill of Stritly, and
dominates the landscape. Goring and Stritly are two
ancient villages, united by an ancient bridge in wood, very
picturesque, with a mill to water at side, of which the artist
painters make all the days some pictures. I admire much your
english villages. Even in the houses of the peasants one sees
a little of the english comfortable—le comfortable anglais.
And all the villages nave the air of a garden, the little houses
surrounded of trees and of flowers. My friend Mister X.
fears that the ancient bridge may be un peu usé, a little
used — ah no, you say "worn out." What misfortune if he
should be replaced by a bridge in iron! Ça se peut, that
may himself, tor even at Venise there is a bridge in iron of the
most detestables, but I hope that not. With a bridge in iron
the river at Goring would be absolutely ugly, as ugly as he is
at Charingcross where the bridge of the railway, traversing the
river, destroys all the beauty of the quai, of the Embankment.
The lock of Goring should not to resemble to the quay of
London.
The valley of the Thames is charming when the sun shines.
When the sky is grey and he falls of the rain, that which arrives
so often in your country, she is a little sad. And when there
is some inundations, and the inhabitants of the riverain houses
are obliged of to rest at the first—rester au premier—because
the rez-de-chaussée is full of water, I believe that the valley of
the Thames is a little humid. Agree, &c., AUGUSTE.

(A fond but foolish Lover rqoiccs in the

I LIKE to see the life-spent leaves
Come tumbling on the sodden ground,
When swallows quit the cottage eaves
To warmer lands and sunshine bound.
I like to watch the year's decay—
A melancholy subject that—
And think of things of yesterday—
The while the rain goes pit-a-pat.
The bracken browns beneath the pine,
The mast is winnowed from the beech,
The creepers make a thin red line.
And shed the blooms we could not
reach.
E'en daisies born of Michaelmas,
Upon the earth are lying flat,
Nasturtiums stoop to meet the grass—
The while the rain goes pit-a-pat.
Across the heath the lapwings wail,
They know the time of joy has fled,
And mourn beneath a sky too pale
The sunsets that were rosy red.
The misty cloak is damp and cold,
It scares the ever-greedy bat.
Who fears to leave yon tower old—
The while the rain goes pit-a-pat.
And yet I love this dreary scene,
This picture of the dyine vear,
That tells of what the world has been
Before the trees were gaunt and sere.
For Time despises day by day—
A leveller, a democrat—
And I uphold his iron sway—
The while the rain goes pit-a-pat.
Oft in the days that are no more
I longed to live. But what avail
To board such wishes in my store.
When Hope is but a fairy tele P
When many an autumn long ago
My ark was wrecked on Ararat,
You could have saved me then, you

Meanwhile the rain goes pit-a-pat.

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
MONSIEUR ELZÉAR BLAZE ON "LE CHASSEUR AU CHIEN D'ARRÊT."
M. BLAZE, I should mention, was not only a keen sportsman,
but he had been a soldier, and had fought in the armies of the
great NAPOLEON. Here and there in his pleasant book he
scatters anecdotes of his military life, which agreeably diversify
the narrative. And it must be admitted that he by no means
forget« the maxim in which he lays it down that one of the
chief duties of a story-teller is to embroider. At the end of
his chapter on the hare he gives an account of the finest "chasse
aux lièvres" that has ever, according to him, taken place in the
memory of man. "There were four hundred thousand of us,
Frenchmen and Austrians in equal numbers, engaged in the
sport, which took place at a little village called Wagram, a few
miles from Vienna. The plain was covered with hares; at every
ten steps several started in front of our side. Our muekeU and
our cannons alarmed them dreadfully, and away they ran in the
hope of escaping. But further on they met two hundred thou-
sand Austrians, who were in no joking humour. So back they
came to us, and squadrons of them were to be seen running
between the two armies. A charge of cavalry, which
was in no way intended for them, would put them to rout.
They pierced our ranks, passed between our legs. We killed
them with sword-cuts, with bayonet-thrusts; we took them
alive. On that day we saw a great slaughter of men and of
hares. A hare killed made one forget the death of a comrade:
it was like farce after tragedy. How many bullets, intended
for the enemy were shot at these unfortunate hares! Never
has so great a number been seen, never before have so many-
been killed. That evening, after the battle, nearly all of us
supped on hare."
HERE is some advice which will come home to the heart of
many a British sportsman :—"Be very careful," says the saga-
with them I advise rather to be behind than in front of them.
Such fellows lose their head at the sight of a partridge, a hare
makes them dizzy, a pheasant throws them into convulsions.
They keep on firing, no matter how, and their neighbourhood
is very dangerous, and the best plan is to keep out of shot of
them." Any young sportsman, however, who reads M. BLAZE'S
chapter on "The Pheasant" might well be excused a slight
tremor at the sight of this bird. This is how it opens :—
"But here is the king of game-birds! the pheasant! At
this name a sportsman's eyes glitter, his heart beats faster.
Listen to him! If he speaks of his exploits he does not pro-
nounce the word pheasant like any other word. With a certain
lightness he mentions the partridge, the rabbit, the hare; but
when he comes to the pheasant his mouth is full, the two
syllables are broadly articulated. He emphasises each of them so
that you might fancy you hear two words joined by a hyphen."
I recommend this method of pronunciation to country-house
parties. But in whatever way pronounced, the pheasant in
M. BLAZE'S day was not easier to stay than he is now, for novices
are told by him that when they shoot at a pheasant they must
in thought separate the body from the tail : —" The tail saves
many a pheasant; it deceives novices. None of the pellets
that hit it count. A shot in the tail scatters many feathers
in the air, and one imagines the bird is wounded. Not at all.
Like the fox in the fable, the bird has lost its tail in the conflict,
and ie no whit the worse for it."
THE above advice is, of course, elementary; but the book is
full of cunning bints, not merely for the improvement of a
man's shooting, but also as to the best method of bringing
various animals to bag, and as to the training and treatment
of dogs. "No man ought to lend either his wife, or his horse,
or his dog," says M. BLAZE, but he proceeds to recount how he
himself, being endowed with a magnanimity out of the common,
once pushed that quality to the extent of lending Médor, the
illustrious Médor, to a friend, Médor, the best of dogs; and that,
an hour afterwards, Medor came back alone, having left his
sportsman on account of a succession of six bad shot«. "A dog
hunts for his own pleasure, much more than for yours. Amuse
him if you want him to amuse you." And, by the way, I may
mention that I never yet met a French dog who was not called
either Médor, or Phanor, or Azor, or Bdphégor, or "k vieux
,Sfop."

RUSSIA 's first fiddle. France bassoon,
And England the big drum;

With wild shillelaghs blent;

THE POETRY OP BUSINESS.—"The Lady Loch" and "Tht

romantic poem? Yet, they are but the names of two gold
mines, and poems are not invariably "gold mines" to their
authors.

DARBY JONES ON THE CAMBRIDGESHIRE.
HONOURED SIR,—Had I had the privilege of being educated
like yourself at a Public School and a University, where the
Knowledge of the Ancients is dispensed like Soothing Syrup to
the offspring of the Good, Great, and Wealthy, I might be able
to grasp that touch of Nature which make all men of the
world kings. But unfortunately my bringing up was established
by Providence amid the grave-to-gay surroundings of a Baked
Potato Merchant's lares and penates. I am not ashamed of my
sire's calling. On the contrary, oft in the stilly night the residue
of his unsold stock-in-trade has furnished me with a substantial
supper-breakfast, while the expiring embers of his peripatetic
furnace have only been equalled in warmth by the condition of
my body after he had discovered the losa of those vegetables
with which the names of R u.r.icu and PARMENTIER will be im-
mortally associated. You, honoured Sir, in your Pacha-like
sanctum—I can picture you in an old-gold dressing-gown, with
fez to match, whirling the luscious Latakia through your
thoroughbred nostrils—will probably wonder what 'my early
training has to do with the winner of the Cambridgeshire. It is
in this wise. Nineteen years ago, on the eve of this race, at the
corner of Waterloo Place, my esteemed parent was pursuing his
vocation, no longer a beardless youngster, but still almost as
fine a judge of a horse as he was of a "spud "—in which latter
merit he yielded not to the late Mr. PADDY GRBBN, of EVANS'S—
when he was approached by two richly-garbed French noblemen,
who not only regaled themselves with the mealy delicacies, but
also in handsome style stood treat to many of the Outcasts of
our ever-hungry thoroughfares. When paying for the delicacies
one of them asked the name of the street. "Waterloo Place,"
said my father, "but no offence meant." "Hal ha I" cried the
stranger, grimly, "always your sacred Waterloo 1 But to-morrow
we shall avenge ourselves at Newmarket. Nevare fear 1" My dad
was one of those sanguine individuals who would have taken
a tip from a broken-down billiard-marker. What did he do?
Sold his entire business the very next morning in the Market,
and planked down all the "dibs" which he could beg, borrow,
or annex, on the Gallic Jongleur! I need not record the result,
but suffice it to say that but for baked potatoes he would not
now be handsomely entombed in Konsul Green Cemetery, nor I
be privileged to communicate to your readers those forecasts
which must make the weather-prophets of the daily journals
redden with ill-concealed envy. That I have servile imitators
I allow, but this is the ubiquitous Fate of Genius. I have seen
Sir HENRY IRVING burlesqued, and have heard Mr. GLADSTONE'S
name held up to the derision of a time-serving audience. Once
more, then, without fear or reproach I shall, like a second BAYARD,
endeavour to find the pea under the thimble, and tune my lyre
with all truthful prescience.
The Victor of a dozen fights will' battle game and true,
Bat I prefer KilwarlMs son when there 'e short work to do.

But oh, beware the Second All that haile from tricky France!

oven of my brain as is the grateful woodcock through the
kitchen when an opulent Mendicant is ravening for his evening
provender.

IT was the Old Lady's habit to sit quietly and contentedly in
the old arbour—which was also a harbour (of refuge)—of which
she was so proud, as defying competition by her friends, much
more demolition by her enemies. From behind a peg in the
Old Lady's chamber, she took a close, helm-shaped black satin
bonnet, a warm cotton-shawl of a bunting-like texture and florid
flag-pattern, and a thick stick with a curious tri-form handle;

JOTTINGS AND TITTLINGS.
(Вт BABOO HURRY BUNOSHO JABBERJEE, B.A.)
No. XXVI.
Mr. Jabberjee expresses some, audaciously sceptical opinions. How he
secured his first Salmon, with the manner in which he presented it to
his divinity.
OWING mainly to lack of opportunity, invitations, ei caetera, l
have not resumed the offensive against members of the grouse
department, but have rather occupied myself in laborious study
of Caledonian dialects, as exemplified in sundry local works of
\

"Whether he had whu-hued wi' Hon'ble Wallace?"
poetical and prose fiction, until I should be competent to con-
verse with the aborigines in their own tongue.
Then (having now the diction of Poet BURNS in my fingers'
ends) I did genially accost the first native I met in the street of
Kilpaitrick, complimenting him upon his honest, sonsie face, and
inquiring whether he had wha-haed wi' Hon'ble WALLACE, and
was to bruise the Peckomaut, or ca' the knowes to the yowes.
But, from the intemperance of his reply, I divined that he was
totally without comprehension of my meaning I
Next I addressed him by turns in the phraseologies of Misters
BLACK, BARRIE, and CROCKETT, Esquires, interlarding my speech
with "whatefers," and " hecha," and "ou-ays," and ?l dod-mons,"
and "loshes," and "tods," ad libitum, to which, after listening
with the most earnest attention, he returned the answer that
he was not acquainted with any Oriental language.
Nor could I by any argument convince thie beetle-head that I
was simply speaking the barbarous accents of his native land 1
Since which, after some similar experiments upon various
peasants, Ac., I have made a rather peculiar discovery.
There is no longer any such article as a separate Scottish
language, and, indeed, I am in some dubitation whether it evei
existed at all, and is not rather the waggish invention of certain
audacious Scottishers, who have taken advantage of the insular
ignorance and credulity of the British public to palm off upon
it several highly fictitious kinds of unintelligible gibberish!
Nay, I will even go farther and express a grave suspicion
whether the Scotland of these bookish romances is not the daring
over a fortnight, I have never seen anything approaching a
mountain pass, nor a dizzy crag, surmounted by an eagle, nor
any stag drinking itself full at eve among the shady trunks of
a deer-foreet! I have never met a single mountaineer in feminine
bonnet and plumes and short petticoats, and pipes inserted in a
bag. Nor do the inhabitante dance in the street upon crossed
sword-blades^—this is purely a London practice. Nor have I seen
any Caledonian snuffing his nostrils with tobacco from the dis-
carded horn of some ram.
Finding that my short kilt is no longer the mould of national
form, I have now altogether abandoned it, while retaining the fox-
tailed belly-purse on account of its convenience and handsome
appearance.
Now let me proceed to narrate how I became the captor of a
large-sized salmon.
Having accepted the loan of Mister CKUM'S fishing-wand, and
attached to my Une certain large flies, composed of black hairs,
red worsted, and gilded thread, which it seems the salmons prefer
even to worms, I sallied forth along the riparian bank of a river,
and proceeded to whip the stream with the severity of Emperor
X кички when engaged in flagellating the ocean.
But waesucks 1 (to employ the perhaps spurious verbiage of
aforesaid Poet BUBNS) my Une, owing to superabundant longi-
tude, did promptly become a labyrinth of Gordian knots, and the
flies (which are named Zulus) attached their barbs to my cap
and adjacent bushes with well-nigh inextricable tenacity, until
at length I had the bright idea to abbreviate the line, so that I
could dangle my bait a foot or two above the surface of the
water—where a salmon could easily obtain it by simply turning
a somersault.
However, after sitting patiently for an hour, as if on a monu-
ment, I could not succeed in catching the eye of any passing
fish, and so, severely disheartened by my ill-luck, I was strolling
on, shouldering my rod,when—odzooks I whom should I encounter
but Mister BAOSHOT and a party of friends, who were watching
his keepers capture salmons from a boat by means of a large net,
a far more practical and effectual method than the cumbersome
and unreliable device of a meretricious fly with a very visible
hook!
And, just as I approached, the net was drawn towards the
bank, and proved to contain three very large Uvely fishes lashing
their tails with ungovernable fury at such detention I
Whereupon I made the humble petition to Mister BAOSHOT
that, since he was now the favourite of Fortune, he was to re-
member him to whom she had denied her simpers, and bestow
upon me the most mediocre of the salmons, since I was desirous
to make a poUte offering to the amiable daughter of my host
and hostess.
And with munificent generosity he presented me with the
largest of the trio, which, with great jubilation, I endeavoured to
carry off under my arm, though severely baffled by the extreme
slipperiness with which (even after its decease) it repeatedly
wallowed in dust, until someone, perceiving my fix, good-
naturedly instructed me how to carry it by perforating its head
with a piece of string.
I found Miss WEE-WEE in a secluded garden seat at the back of
the Manse, incommoded, as usual, by the society of Mister Сигм
"Sir," I said, addressing him politely (for I was extremely
anxious for his departure, since I could not well present my
salmon to Miss WBE-WEE and request the quid-pro-quo of her
affection in his presence), "accept my gratitude for the usufruct
of your rod, which has produced magnificent fruit. You will
find the instrument leaning against the palings of the front
garden." And with this I made secret signals to Miss WEB-WEE
that she was to dismiss him; but she remained bashful, and he
seemed totally unaware that he was the drug of the market!
At last, weary of concealing my captured salmon any longer
behind the small of my back, I was about to inform Mister Сигм
that he had Miss LOUISA'S permission to absent himself, when
she broke the silence by informing me that, as the old familiar
friend of both parties, I was to be the first to hear a piece of
news—to wit, that DONALD (Mister O.'s baptismal appeUation)
and she were just become the engaged couple 1
I was so overcome by grief and indignation at her perfidious
duplicity (since she had frequently encouraged me in my
mockeries of her admirer's uncouthnees and rusticity), that I
stuck in the throat, and then flung the salmon violently across
a boundary hedge into a yard of poultry.
"Madam," I said, "that fish was to have been laid at your
feet as the visible pledge, of my devotion. You have not only
lost the gift of a splendid salmon, but have thrown away the
heart of a well-educated native B.A. and Member of the Bar!
And you have gained—hoity toity I What? Why, a Scotch
imposture of a ben trovato. For, after a prolonged residence of

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
But almost immediately I was taken by violent remorse for
my presumption, and. shed the tears of contrition, entreating
forgiveness—nay, more, I scrambled through a hole in a very
thorny hedge, and, recovering the salmon (which had not had
time to become very severely henpecked), I begged them to
accept it between them as a token of my esteem and good
wishes, which they joyfully consented to do. I had expected
that my worthy host and hostess would have shared my
astounded disappointment on hearing of their daughter's engage-
ment; but, on the contrary, they received the news with
smiling complacency.
It appears that Mr. CRUM, though endowed with a somewhat
sheepish and bucólica! exterior, is of tip-top Scottish caste
and lineage, and the landed proprietor.
I am not to deny the attractiveness of such qualities, though
I had hitherto been under the Fool's Paradise of an impression
that they would have infinitely preferred this humble self as a
son-in-law.
However, I am now emerging from my doleful dumps, with
the reflection that, after all, it is contrary to common-sense to
drain the cup of misery to the dregs for so totally inadequate
a cause as the ficklety of any feminine!

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Vidi, Vieil" The'remark has been made before, or
it might have served to tell The Story of My Life, which Sir
RICHARD Т км г KB, under the fostering care of CASSELL'S, has ex-
panded into two volumes. The resources of type in the mammoth
establishment in La Belle Sauvage Yard are practically illimit-
able. But it is probable that when these two volumes were set
up there was scarcity in the "box" containing the first person
singular. It is to some extent inevitable when a man writes his
autobiography that he should have frequent recourse to the letter
I. Sir RICHARD TEMPLE literally peppers the pronoun over his
pages. In the evening of his days, reviewing his career, he is
honestly lost in loving admiration of his own achievements. "For
sixteen years I governed about 115 millions of British subjects. . .
For five years I conducted the finances of British India. . . I
personally supervised and commanded in the field the operations
for the relief of famine for two occasions, on a gigantic and
unprecedented scale. . . I governed, at different lunes, the
provinces which included both the capital cities, Calcutta and
Bombay." This is a summary of big achievements. Incident-
ally, we learn how "the villagers loved to watch me, the pale-
faced, beardless Anglo-Saxon, seated against the trunk of some
monarch of the grove, dispensing patriarchal justice." Sir
RICHARD ever has an eye for scenic effect. Thus, "on the
day of my leaving Lahore, I spoke my final words to the natives
standing in front of the old Moslem gateway under the um-
brageous trees." But though consciously decorative him-
self, he is not niggardly in his admission of corresponding
beauty in other directions. There is a pretty scene of his un-
expectedly coming upon the Himalayas. "Instinctively I take
off my white helmet to salute the peerless mountains on this
my first sight of them." Like ways they bows. My Baronite can
well imagine how, had time and place been convenient, Sir
RICHARD would have taken on each arm a couple of the youngest
and prettiest of the Himalayas, and led them off to show them
the tea-room of the House of Commons, the lobby, the terrace,
and the table in the library at which the late Member for
Evesham used to sit. All this—-or a little of it—is funny. Butas
often happens the well of tears is near the source of laughter. Sir
RICHARD TEMPLE'S career in India was one of unbroken success,
a triumph achieved by high capacity and stupendous industry.
His career in the House of Commons was a lamentable, occasion-
ally a ludicrous failure. In March, 1880, he resigned the Governor-
ship of Bombay and hastened home to take part in the General
Election. For him, the House of Commons was merely a new
world to conquer. It would be India over again, only with more
brilliant results. Beaten in East Worcestershire in 1880, he was
returned for Evesham in 1885. It was characteristic of him that
he made hie maiden speech on the first night of the first session

failure. Through seven sessions he stubbornly fought against
the prejudices of the House. At first amazed that it would not
listen to him, then angry, at length subdued. Finally, at the
dissolution of 1892, he resolved to retire to " my ancestral home,"
and write the story of a Ufe that should prove to a scoffing
House of Commons that the eighteenth century had not a
monopoly of Indian administrators of the stamp of WARREN
HASTINGS and CLIVB.
Had Mr. E. E. BENSON taken a hint from his own title of
Limitations, and limited the dialogue of his characters to
just one half of what he has given them to say, at the same
time enlivening them all round with something to do, his novel
with the above title would have been half its present bulk, but
its value would have been doubled. The dialogue is bright, not
so bright as to be of dazzling brilliancy, but just so steadily bright
as to weary the reader's attention and induce him to close his
eyes and the book. Now this ought not to be, as the dramatis
persona are few, distinctly drawn, and true to Ufe: the story is
as "simple as bonjour," and the picturesque descriptions, notably
that of Athens, are excellent. The misfortune of having previously
written a novel so successful as Dodo handicaps its author with
the public. Mr. BENSON has to go one better than Dodo. That
Mr. BENSON is a student of certain popular contributions to
Mr. Punch's popular periodical is evidenced by one of his light-
and-leading characters suggesting that a piece of sculpture should
be executed from University models and called " Typical Develop-
ments of Modern Dons." The magnum opus, "Typical Develop-
ments," projected to be in several volumes, and started many
years ago by the anonymous diarist of Happy Thoughts, has never,
the Baron believes, advanced farther than the note-book stage. A
post-mortem examination of this wonderful coUection may pro-
duce a posthumous work of unexampled interest, as it was in-
bended to be a book of the very rarest ideas; only, the ideas
becoming rarer and rarer every day, most of the pages in the vari-
ous volumes, all pre-arranged, panned out, and pre-named in order,
still remain blank. However, this is just thrown in as a huit
x> Mr. BENSON in case his sculpturing character should need a
few that might be useful to the Typical Developer, whose
office it clearly is, not to originate but to develop. So says
of a new Parliament. That was of itself sufficient to predicate

Then (having now the diction of Poet BURNS in my fingers'

inquiring whether he had wha-haed wi' Hon'ble WALLACE, and
was to bruise the Peckomaut, or ca' the knowes to the yowes.

totally without comprehension of my meaning!

with "whatefers," and " hechs," and "ou-ays," and 7l dod-mons,"
and "loehes," and "tods," ad libitum, to which, after listening
with the most earnest attention, he returned the answer that
he was not acquainted with any Oriental language.

Nay, I will even go farther and express a grave suspicion
whether the Scotland of these bookish romances is not the daring
over a fortnight, I have never aeen anything approaching a
mountain pass, nor a dizzy crag, surmounted by an eagle, nor
any stag drinking itself full at eve among the shady trunks of
a deer-forest 1 I have never met a single mountaineer in feminine
bonnet and plumes and short petticoats, and pipes inserted in a
bag. Nor do the inhabitants dance in the street upon crossed
sword-blades;—this is purely a London practice. Nor have I seen
any Caledonian snuffing his nostrils with tobacco from the dis-
carded horn of some ram.
Finding that my short kilt is no longer the mould of national
form, I have now altogether abandoned it, while retaining the fox-
tailed belly-purse on account of its convenience and handsome
appearance.
Now let me proceed to narrate how I became the captor of a
large-sized salmon.
Having accepted the loan of Mister CHUM'S fishing-wand, and
attached to my line certain large flies, composed of black hairs,
red worsted, and gilded thread, which it seems the salmons prefer
even to worms, I sallied forth along the riparian bank of a river,
and proceeded to whip the stream with the severity of Emperor
XERXES when engaged in flagellating the ocean.
But waeeucks! (to employ tin; perhaps spurious verbiage of
aforesaid Poet BURNS) my line, owing to superabundant longi-
tude, did promptly become a labyrinth of Gordian. knote, and the
flies (which are named Zulus) attached their barbs to my cap
and adjacent bushes with well-nigh inextricable tenacity, until
at length I had the bright idea to abbreviate the line, so that I
could dangle my bait a foot or two above the surface of the
water—where a salmon could easily obtain it by simply turning
a somersault.
However, after sitting patiently for an hour, as if on a monu-
ment, I could not succeed in catching the eye of any passing
fish, and so, severely disheartened by my ill-luck, I was strolling
on, shouldering my rod,when—odzooks! whom should I encounter
but Mister BAOSHOT and a party of friends, who were watching
his keepers capture salmons from a boat by means of a large net,
a far more practical and effectual method than, the cumbersome
and unreliable device of a meretricious fly with a very visible
hook I
And, just as I approached, the net was drawn towards the
bank, and proved to contain three very large lively fishes lashing
their tails with ungovernable fury at such detention 1
Whereupon I made the humble petition to Mister BAGSHOT
that, since he was now the favourite of Fortune, he was to re-
member him to whom she had denied her simpers, and bestow
upon me the most mediocre of the salmons, since I was desirous
to make a polite offering to the amiable daughter of my host
and hostess.
And with munificent generosity he presented me with the
largest of the trio, which, with great jubilation, I endeavoured to
carry off under my arm, though severely baffled by the extreme
slipperiness with which (even after its decease) it repeatedly
wallowed in dust, until someone, perceiving my fix, good-
naturedly instructed me how to carry it by perforating its head
with a piece of string.
I found Miss WEE-WEE in a secluded garden seat at the back of
the Manse, incommoded, as usual, by the society of Mister Спим.
'' Sir," I said, addressing him politely (for I was extremely
anxious for his departure, since I could not well present my
salmon to Miss WEE-WEE and request the quid-pro-quo of her
affection in his presence), "accept my gratitude for the usufruct
of your rod, which has produced magnificent fruit. You will
find the instrument leaning against the palings of the front
garden." And with this I made secret signals to Miss WEE-WEB
that she was to dismiss him; but she remained bashful, and he
seemed totally unaware that he was the drug of the market!

"Madam," I said, "that fish was to have been laid at your

But almost immediately I was taken by violent remorse for
my presumption, and. shed the tears of contrition, entreating
forgiveness—nay, more, I scrambled through a hole in a very
thorny hedge, and, recovering the salmon (which had not had
tune to become very severely henpecked), I begged them to
accept it between them as a token of my esteem and good
wishes, which they joyfully consented to do. I had expected

that they would have infinitely preferred this humble self as a

"VENI, Vidi, Vieil" The'remark has been made before, or
it might have served to tell The Story of My Life, which Sir
RICHARD Тк.мI-J.E, under the fostering care of CASBELL'S, has ex-
panded into two volumes. The resources of type in the mammoth
establishment in La Belle Sauvage Yard are practically illimit-
able. But it is probable that when these two volumes were set
up there was scarcity in the "box" containing the first person
singular. It is to some extent inevitable when a man writes his
autobiography that he should have frequent recourse to the letter
I. Sir RICHARD TEMPLE literally peppers the pronoun over his
pages. In the evening of his days, reviewing his career, he is
honestly lost in loving admiration of his own achievements. "For
sixteen years I governed about 115 millions of British subject«. . .
For five years I conducted the finances of British India. . . I
personally supervised and commanded in the field the operations
for the relief of famine for two occasions, on a gigantic and
unprecedented scale. . . I governed, at different times, the
provinces which included both the capital cities, Calcutta and
Bombay." This is a summary of big achievements. Incident-
ally, we learn how "the villagers loved to watch me, the pale-
faced, beardless Anglo-Saxon, seated against the trunk of some
monarch of the grove, dispensing patriarchal justice." Sir
RICHARD ever has an eye for scenic effect. Thus, "on the
day of my leaving Lahore, I spoke my final words to the natives
standing in front of the old Moslem gateway under the um-
brageous trees." But though consciously decorative him-
self, he is not niggardly in his admission of corresponding
beauty in other directions. There is a pretty scene of his un-
expectedly coming upon the Himalayas. "Instinctively I take
off my white helmet to salute the peerless mountains on this
my first sight of them." Likeways they bows. My Barpnite can
well imagine how, had time and place been convenient, Sir
RICHARD would have taken on each arm a couple of the youngest
and prettiest of the Himalayas, and led them off to show them
the tea-room of the House of Commons, the lobby, the terrace,
and the table in the library at which the late Member for
Evesham used to sit. All this—-or a little of it—is funny. But as
often happens the well of tears is near the source of laughter. Sir
RICHARD TEMPLE'S career in India was one of unbroken success,
a triumph achieved by high capacity and stupendous industry.
His career in the House of Commons was a lamentable, occasion-
ally a ludicrous failure. In March. 1880, he resigned the Governor-
ship of Bombay and hastened home to take part in the General
Election. For him, the House of Commons was merely a new
world to conquer. It would be India over again, only with more
brilliant results. Beaten in East Worcestershire in 1880, he was
returned for Evesham in 1885. It was characteristic of him that
he made his maiden speech on the first night of the first session

failure. Through seven sessions he stubbornly fought against
the prejudices of the House. At first amazed that it would not
listen to him, then angry, at length subdued. Finally, at the
dissolution of 1892, he resolved to retire to " my ancestral home,"
and write the story of a Ufe that should prove to a scoffing
House of Commons that the eighteenth century had not a
monopoly of Indian administrators of the stamp of WARREN
HASTINGS and CLJVB.
Had Mr. E. E. BENSON taken a hint from his own title of
Limitations, and limited the dialogue of his characters to
just one half of what he has given them to say, at the same
time enlivening them all round with something to do, his novel
with the above title would have been half its present bulk, but
its value would have been doubled. The dialogue is bright, not
so bright as to be of dazzling brilliancy, but just so steadily bright
as to weary the reader's attention and induce him to close his
eyes and the book. Now this ought not to be, as the dramatis
personœ are few, distinctly drawn, and true to Ufe: the story is
as "simple as bonjour," and the picturesque descriptions, notably
that of Athens, are excellent. The misfortune of having previously
written a novel so successful as Dodo handicaps its author with
the public. Mr. BENSON has to go one better than Dodo. That
Mr. BENSON is a student of certain popular contributions to
Mr. Punch's popular periodical is evidenced by one of his light-
and-leading characters suggesting that a piece of sculpture should
be executed from University models and called " Typical Develop-

years ago by the anonymous diarist of Happy Thoughts, has never,
the Baron believes, advanced farther than the note-book stage. A

ous volumes, all pre-arranged, panned out, and pre-named in order,
still remain blank. However, this is just thrown in as a hint
to Mr. BENSON in case his sculpturing character should need a
few that might be useful to the Typical Developer, whose
office it clearly is, not to originate but to develop. So says

Prayer on the morning of Trafalgar J)ay.]
THE memories of greatness make men
great,
Till the ohill pulse of coward fear and
greed
Palsies the slackened sinews of the State.
Great sailor I Here to-day let England
heed
Her best-loved hero's lesson, written large
In that brief life whose fame is England's
charge!
Priceless possession, of all precious gifts
Most precious, is the record of the man,
Heedless of odds or diplomatic shifts,
So that his patriot heart in honour's van
Might strike for that "just cause," unto
life's end,
"Which is entrusted to me to defend!"
Certain there be to-day that curl the lip
In cynic scorn at mere "humanity,"
And " sentiment," which lets large chancee
slip;
Would bid self-interest rule on shore or
sea
Our island policy .pledged to things that pay,
And swell our powers. It was not NEL-
It may be that reminder shall strike home
Where gentler pleadings fail. No
shouter he,
No mere emotional thing of froth and
foam;
He struck for "great and glorious vic-
tory,"
And gained it, dying, strong, yet soft of
mood,
For England's glory, and for Europe's
good!
Yon wreathed column, those memorial
flowers,
This thronging crowd whose thoughts a
moment lift
High as the effigy which above us towers,
Passingly conscious of the glorious gift
Of such a memory—shall their influence
fail,
Or pass, unfruitful, like an old wife's tale?
Illustrious seaman, we are sea-lords still,
And must be, till that sea o'ersweeps
our fame,
Burying all records of the valour, skill,
Love and devotion which upbuilt our
name
As rulers of the waves that wash our coast.
Shall sordid thrift leave that an empty
boast?
Hold firm, hold fast, ye countrymen of

SPUKTiVJÜ ÖUJNIÜ8.
On a fine night a Financier remembers in a well-
iciiuwn pUunuuiltc t/ie AlounltytU of other days.
Гик moon to-night shines lull and fair,
±ier gentle tones make argentine
The oak and chestnut nearly Dare,
And deepen shadows ot tue pine.
The manor house, ail red by day,
Is silvered to a deadly wnite,
And here and there a long bright ray
Pierces that copse with spear of light.
Just twenty years ago the scene
Was just tne same for you and me 1
The moon was lull; the weirdhke sheen
Made glamour round our trysting tree,
The beecn, that all our secreta knew,
And never once our trust betrayed •
A loyal-hearted friend, so true
That e'en his fall of leaf he stayed.
We spoke our vows, as lovers will,
Arranged a life-long plan of dreams!
While on our rapture, calm and still,
The moon looked down with blessing
beams!
As though she said, "My children, this
is but a forecast of your joy.
Oh, prithee join another kiss!
Thrice happy maid I Brave constant
boy I"
This mute advice we did not need—
It naturally came to both—
But .still we gave Diana meed
For thus approving of our troth.
Your father's wrath i swore to dare
For you, my sweetest empress-queen I
Though sovereigns I 'd none to spare;
And you were only seventeen I
Your sire was one to cut a dash,
Lord of the park wherein we stood.
He never wanted ready cash,
And ever had a princely mood I
Oh 1 how I quaked beneath his eye,
And envied him his lavish reign!—
Before, somehow, he had to fly,
And seek another home in Spain I
And you went, too! Some whiskered Don
Mayhap has claimed you for his wife;
Perhaps, like me, you think upon,
Sometimes, the ironies of Ufe.
I now am rich, am not afraid
Of any cavalier's doubloon!
Diana should have lent her aid
To us, when Father shot the moon!
"THE SORBOWS OF-SOLICITOBS."
SIR,—Why should the public pay three,
nay four, lawyers to do the work of one?
The junior counsel is altogether super-
fluous, yet ''the etiquette of the Bar"
prescribes that a Q.C. shall not appear in
Court without a junior.
If a litigant may and does appear in
Court in person, why should he not be
represented by his solicitor, thus doing
away with two unnecessary lawyers?
To carry the idea a step farther, why
should a litigant be forced to appear either
in person or by counsel before a judge,
who is himself a lawyer?
Why should not the solicitors for the
respective parties arrange matters between
themselves without the intervention of a
judge, thus doing away with the third un-
necessary lawyer?
By this simple arrangement only one
lawyer would remain, namely,
Your obedient servant.
London, October. BEDFORD Rows.
Sea,—I have been in practice for ninety-
nine years, and consider, therefore, that
The curse of our profession is over-
crowding, owing, I believe, to the modern
craze for examinations.
A young fellow finds that by steady
"cram" he can pass the three qualifying
"exams," as he calls them, and be ad-
mitted. In my days, the examination
was a mere matter of form, and neither
cleverness nor "cram" were necessary to
satisfy the then examiners.
My proposal is to do away with the at-
traction of the "exams" altogether, and,
as experientia docet, not to admit any soli-
citor who has been less than ten years in
a lawyer's office, and who is under forty
years of age. I am, yours, «fee.,
OLD PRACTITIONER.
Burgess Hill, October.
DEAR SIR,—It is all very well to talk
about the sorrows of a solicitor, but look
at my case.
I was briefed at the Blankshire Sessions
to defend a prisoner charged with stealing
a pair of boot-lacee.
Entirely owing to my, I will not say elo-
quence, but exertions on his behalf, the
prisoner got off—with twelve months' haid
labour—and so did his solicitor; he did
not get the hard labour, but he got oil
without paying my fee.
I have applied to him at the address en-
dorsed on the back sheet (my sole instruc-
tions) he supplied me with, but he is not
known there.
I can only trust t but by the time I am
on the bench he will be discovered, and
brought before me, and if he is not a sor-
rowing solicitor now, he will be then.
Yours disgustedly,
Temple, October. RISING JUNIOR.

houses, saw nothing but a pine forest coming down to the marge
of a beach stretching to the horizon. JOHN BLAOKLBY discerned
in it the making of an international watering-place that would
beat anything at present going either in Great Britain or France.
Situate almost exactly midway between London and Paris,
within four hours' travel of either point, JOHN'S prophetic soul
swelled at prospect of the pleasure-loving population of two
capitals racing to Mayville. That was the name he forthwith
bestowed upon the new watering-place. Five minutes later he
decided that (when everything is completed) the new para-
dise shall be inaugurated by the gracious presence of the
Duchess of YORK. The_ whole thin« was irresistibly logical.
The place was called (or is to be called) Mayville. The Duchees
of YORK'S maiden пяте was the Princess MAY. Q. T5. D; In
other words, There you are I
That settled, JOHN BLACKLEY went to work to prepare every-
thing for the inauguration. He secured the refusal of the
property, and then laid it out on the most beautiful and con-
vincing maps. Broad roads traverse the pine wood. A row
of charming vjllas front the sea. There is a pier, with a band
upon it, a casino, a racecourse, and golf links four miles long,
in contemplation of which the golf champion of England has
been thrown into a state of ecstasy. Finally, in order that
no time may be lost by the crowd making their way to May-
ville, JOHV BI.ACKLEY has arranged for a branch line of railway
from Etaples to the sea-front, a distance of three mi 1rs.
Whilst all the world will be welcome to purchase building
sites on the property, JOHN BLAOKLEY, shrewd Yorkshireman as
he is, has been first in the field. He has selected for his
private residence a site on a wooded height, commanding rare
views of land and sea. Practical in every detail, he has had a
platform built'among the branches of the pine-trees at about
the level of his drawing-room window. (Млто.—At present it is
the only building in Mayville.) SARK and I made a perilous
ladder ascent and viewed the prospect o'er.
"Yes," said our guide, regarding the scene with soul full of
content, "this will be JOHN BLACKLEY'S home. We are stand-
ing now on the level of the drawing-room. The dining-room
will be below, opening put on to a terrace. There are the
stables, and there is the billiard-room."
"Where?" aeked SARK, eagerly following the indication of
the outstretched walking-stick.
He saw nothing but the top of a pine-tree. JOHN BLACKI/EY
beheld as clearly as if it stood there the green table with the lighte
above, the high benches at either end of the room, the marking-
board on the wall, and the rack full of cues. He even heard the
rattling of the billiard balls. Faintly, in the dim and distant
future sounded a ghostly voice, "What's the score, marker?"
"Well, it beats me," said SARK, when we had carefully de-
scended from the level of a drawing-room in a house for the
foundations of which the first sod has not yet been turned.
"But mind you. that's the way big things are done, and that's
the sort of man brings them to pass."
Certainly there is fruitful ground to till. To begin with,
Mayville has the rare advantage of combination of pine forest
and sea air. The story of the forest is a romance. Seventy
years ago Mayville was like the rest of this part of the coast,
a monotonous waste of sandhills. A retired Parisian notary
bought many acres of the eand heaps for a mere song. One
day it occurred to him that he would turn the sandhills into a
forest. People laughed at him, but he went his way, morning
and afternoon, planting pines in the sand, and to-day a forest
blooms, where at the beginning of the century stretched a wilder-
ness of sand. As for the beach, SARK avers that what with its
length and breadth and openness to the unbroken sea, it reminds
him much of Biarritz.
The country round Mayville is full of historic association.
Within easy drive through leafy lanes is an ancient monastery,
whose chapel has for centuries witnessed the midnight gather-
ing of a cowled congregation, its walls echoing with sound
where NAPOLEON passed two nights arranging the invasion of
England, still unaccomplished. Yesterday SABK visited the
field of Agincourt, and to-morrow drivée to Crecy. Is full of
his good fortune at Agincourt. Met there an old sergeant, who
still wears the badge ofthe Duke of ALENCON. He fought by the
Duke's side, pulled out the arrow that pierced his breast, attempted
to staunch wound. No use. The old man, who must have been
in the thickest of the fight, also assisted at the obsequies of the
Duke of BRABANT and the Archbishop of SF.NS, who fell on that
fateful day.
"Seems a long time back," I said, musingly.
SARK admits it would be so in ordinary case ; but in respect of
great battles, always one or two survivors. Besides, this old soldier
sold to SARK a horse-pistol, part of a crossbow, a buckle with

The Old Sergeant.
S. and a coronet over it (evidently from the belt of the Earl of
Suffolk, one of HENRY THE FIFTH'S captains) and the plume from
the helmet of a nameless knight. That seems to settle the
matter.
As for JOHN BLACKLEY, he regards these great battles as
having been fought for a purpose only now developing itself.
"They might," he says, "have been located west of Havre,
nearer Calais, or south of Amiens. But then they would not
have been within driving distance of Mayville, forming, so to
speak, extraneous attractions to pur golf links, our racecourse,
our pine woods, and our sea-bathing conveniences. Quite clear
to me why Agincourt and Crecy were fought."
"DOCKINO HORSES" was the heading of a paragraph in the
Timet last week. "I have seen rocking-horses," observed an
erudite reader, "but ""You don't understand," said the
well-informed party. "Boats and vessels are put in docks"
"And prisoners," interrupted the erudite. The well-informed
withered him with a glance. "I am speaking of the expression
'docking.' If a ship is docked and a horse is docked, what do
they both possess in common? Clearly capacity for sea-voyaging.
Ergo, the horses that are docked must be sea-horses." "The
rest was silence."
THAT lion cub born in the Aquarium on Trafalgar day last
week "can be called nothing else," says the Daily Chronicle,
"but Nelson I" Of course, that 's it, Nelson, the sea-lion with
of praise and prayer. At Etaples, three miles off, is t IIP house
the "British mane."

AUGUSTE EN ANGLETERRE.
DEAR MISTER,—I have to pick one bone with you, or rather
with a certain Mister JABBERJEE, jeune rédacteur of your journal
so distinguished. He arrives by hazard that, being at the
country, at Goring, I had not the occasion of to read your
journal, and that, by consequence, I saw not the injuries of
Mister JABBERJEB before of to expedite to you my last letter.
What that this may be who arrives, I go to be calm. In France,
at the moment of the most great excitation, the word of order
is invariably. " Soyons calmes!" Me also I say, "Be we calm!"
But, by blue, is it that AUGUSTE MONTMORENCI DE BASSOM-
PIERRB will suffer the injuries of a nigger, of a man who is
black, of a man who names himself HURRY BUNGSHO? Sapristi,
mais non! Truly, until here, I have read hie letters with a
certain sentiment of admiration for the poor Hindou, who
essayed all his possible for to learn the english language so
difficult, that I write and that I speak so currently. I thought to
my proper efforts when I was young student, and, as one says
in english, a feeling fellow makes one wonderfully kind.
It was at the month of June, 1895, that I had the honour
of to address to you my first letter. At that epoch thore Mister
JABBERJEK was I know not where. There is but ten months
that he commenced his letters. And now he say» to me some
injuries, to me that he calls "a mere Parisian Frenchman," me of
who the family wae noble and illustrious, and inhabited her
middle-aged castle, when Paris herself was but the chief-place
of a little kingdom, and when the Oriental Indian were but some
oountrys of savages, devastated by the barbers — barbares!
Sacré nom de nom, c'est trop fort l But be we calm!
Only I say to Mister JABBERJEK that, if he would to come in
France, there is two of my friends, journaliste of Paris—and
yon know, dear Mister, that the Parisian journalist is one can
not more ferocious—two journalists, I say, of the most warriors,
guerriers, who would be truly enchanted of to arrange with his
witnesses a meeting quelque part, some part. But I doubt my-
self of it that he may be too poltroon! Then there is the
my faith, I will make him, already black, blue and black 1 Well
sure I if I encounter him some part, even in the street, I will
pull that "nose of a cultivated britdsh subject," of which he
speaks 1 MiUe tonnerresl Mais soyons calmes!
In this moment here it is a little difficult to continue tranquilly
the recital of my voyage. Allons donc! I rested still some days
at Goring, where I saw one time the fishers at the border of the
Thames, entrapping nothing, all to fact like the fishers at the
border of the Seine, but by a cold, ah ça, un froid! And then
I part by a beating rain, une pluie battante, and I go all the long
of the valley of the Thames until London, by Reding, Maiden-
bed. Tápelo, Stanes, from where I see all at the far the castle
of the great and illustrious QUEBN, and partout the sky is grey
and he falb of the rain—ah mon Dieu, quel pays, quel climat!—
and at London also, and at the beyond, until to this that we
arrive to Brighton. And there, where auparavant I have seen
but some rain, he makes fine. С est épatant! After my voyage in
railway I hasten myself of to make a little walk by the fine tune.
Et i-iiili'i, almost the first thing that I see, in going out from
the hotel, it is a saltimbanque, a singer of the streets, that which
you call a "nigger." There is much of them at Brighton, and
enough diverting sometimes, not like the horrible organs of the
streets, or the vendors of journals who shout frightfully
"On i имя!" Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire? These last at Brighton
are insupportable. But the niggers sing on the plage, and their
music is not so horrible as the interminable noise of the cafés at
Monte Carlo or at Nice. Eh well, this nigger, who carries a
false collar red and white enormously large around of the neck,
and a droll of little bonnet, like a pie of pork galonné of gold,
on the head, regards me with the smile or a buffoon. And all
of following, tout de suite, he recalls to me Mister JAHBKIUEK!
Stille tonnerres! Immediately I re-enter to the hotel, where I
write to you this letter to protest against those injuries, those
outrages, so abominable. But be we calm!

"KIDNAPPED. A Chinaman seized in London. Remains at
the Legation." Such was one among the sensational "headers"
taken with a splash and a dash by several papers last Friday.
The rapid reader of headlines, who stops not his running for his
reading, would, from the above, have deduced that a Chinaman,
seized in London, had been chow-chow'd or chop-chopped up, and
his "remains" had been found in the house of the Chinese
Legation! Not a bit. All know by now what happened. The
heading had simply omitted the pronoun "He" before "re-
mains." "He remains at the Chinese Legation." That's all.

"SKENT THE Horxns, MY MAN?"
HUNTING IN A FOG.
"AYE, SIR. THKY BE IN T'NEXT FIELD. AH CAN HEAR T'HUNTSMAN A-RWEARIN' AT 'EM Г
WHAT WILL NOT BE SAID'AT THE GUILDHALL ON THE NINTH.
THE LORD CH-XC-LL-R remarked that the attention of tht
Public had been recently attracted to the grievances of barrister?
and solicitors. If outsiders did not understand the difficultief
of the situation, it was because they did not comprehend thi
origin of the argument. The fact was, that both branches ol
the profession were willing to regard laymen as shells and liti-
gation as the prime cause of the existence of the oyster
Lawyers naturally preferred the bivalve to its covering. Sr
they clamoured for justice with, and not at, all coste.
A distinguished admiral, returning thanks for the Navy, sai('
that the country should recognise the importance of the Senioi
Service. Patriotism was a most excellent thing, but it woult1
not go very far without pay. An increased fleet meant rapii'
promotion. So by all means let ships be procured as rapidl.
as possible, and there would be any number of officers in thr
senior ranks to commission them. As to the question of pro-
curing the men before the masts that was a matter of detail.
A celebrated general, in responding for the Army, congratu-
lated his colleague upon his very sensible remarks. In these
piping days of peace " pace " was of equal importance to efficiency.
Anyone could fight, and the British Army had always been equal
to the occasion. What the Service really wanted was men who
could keep their hunters and enliven garrison society with
smart balls and pleasant polo parties. It would never do to
have the army flooded with youngsters who could scarcely pay
for their uniforms.
The Marquis of S-L-SB-RY thought the present occasion a
fitting one for making a clean breast. He entirely agreed with
Lord CHARLES BERESFORD as to the propriety of seizing Egypt,
and he begged to say that he had already taken steps to carry
the proposed plan into immediate effect. However, as it was
customary to inform Foreign Powers, in the first instance, of any
step of international importance, perhaps the reporters would
be_ so gooJ as to let his statement go no farther. His right hon.
friend, Mr. G., had already stigmatised the SULTAN as "the
Great Assassin." That was a good name for him, but what could
be done when the Concert of Europe was a sham? He didn't
mind telling those present (but he did not want it to go farther)
that England has a private understanding with Italy, of which
Germany and Austria were to know nothing. As to his nephew,
the Leader of the House of Commons, he thought he gave up
too much time to golf, and far too little leisure to politics.
Mr. J-S-PH CH-MB-RL-N was pleased to put in an appearance,
as it was always as well to speak when the noble Lord had sat
down. He considered himself (and so did many others) the
real Boss of the Ministry, or, at any rate, of the Hwise
of Commons. He believed in advertisements, but was
rather annoyed at the cartoon in last week's Punch, which
suggested that he had changed his principles now and
again. But he had got out of it by saying that he was "in-
consistent," which produced—as intended—a laueh. He had
confessed at a dinner of the Newspaper Press Fund that he had
once sent a joke to Punch which had not been inserted. He
might now declare that he had not sent this subject for that
cartoon—but it had been inserted. This statement, he was
happy to see, had produced a laugh—as intended.
The LORD M-Y-R thanked them all very much for drinking
his health. However, he was bound to say, that good as were
the speeches to which they had just listened, he could have made
far better.
Facilia Descensus.
LORD ROSEBERY says "his information 'e good ";
And so, there is no doubt, are his intentions;
But such " good " things may sometimes pave the road
To—well, a place politeness never mentions.
ECCLESIASTICAL QUERY.—It is all very well пли? calling him
"Dr. TBMPLB," but, when he becomes Archbishop, ought not
he to be "Dr. Cathedral "?

ABOUT THE RED ROBE.
A CHANGE has come over the spirit of Managers, and therefore
of Playwrights, as distinguished from Original Dramatists. The
Problem Play and the Ibsenitish Woman, the modern fashion-
able accessories, the whiskies-and-soda drinking, the perpetual
cigarette-smoking, the rude repartees of sharp Society folk, all
these are temporarily shelved, and the drama comes again before
us in its romantic phase with a clean bill of health, so that no
longor will the "Young Person" be excluded from the audi-
torium.
What are the odds against old Drury Lane, after the panto-
mime carnival is over, returning to the HALLIDAY times of
SCOTT'S novels dramatised? Nothing more likely, unless DUMAS,
or the works of one of the modern Dumas-lings in fiction, be
chosen for adaptation. ANTHONY HOPE—anything but a forlorn
Hope—GiLBERT PARKER, STANLEY WEYMAN, with others, all
springing up in the same line and deluging; us with cavaliers,

"WHAT'S HECOME or WAKING?"

Why, here he u, disguúed us Burglar Gil—the newest hero, law-breaker,
curd-sharper, liar, picklock, duellist, hypocrite, anil bungler; but false to the
band that pays him— NKVKU!
swash-bucklers, French kings, conquerers and cardinals!
Stirring times, too, for tho theatrical costumier! Up goes the
price of hauberks and "flat King Johns!" Then there are new
kingdoms to be opened to the adventurer, such as Ruritania.
More work for the costumier and the artistic designer!
And, what a timo for the genuine playwrignt! Not for
the original dramatist who invents his own plot; he may get a
look in now and again; but the playwrignt who sees what
stuff there is, in a published story, effectively serviceable for
diMmatic purposes. His is the chance. He has but to read,
mark, and send in his card to the author with "gente own
materials made up" on it, and if he can but come to terms
with the gent in question — they are getting a bit wary,
now •— the playwright only has to propitiate the manager,
and the tnck is done. Capitally done, too, is this same
trick by Adapter ROSE, who has performed the operation
for drama on STANLEY WEYMAN'S romance of Under the
I' •! Kobe. All the plums are here; all the scenes are
effective; the plot clear ae possible; the "mounting" pic-
ROSE has lost a point in the last act, when the Cardinal and
Benée ought most certainly to have had a scene together; and
in this last act the dramatic construction is so faulty that
the finish is a foregone conclusion full twenty minutes before
the curtain drops, and all that while actors and audience are
"only purtendin'."
To Mr. HERBEBT WAKING as Gil de Berault, all say, "thou
art the man." Mr. VALENTINE'S Bichelieu is striking, and
this figure remains in the memory while the others vanish.
Captain Larolle is a bit of a droll, but is not le rôle in
which, for his own sake, most of us would have preferred to see
Mr. CYRIL MAUDE. Yet is he uncommonly good, and at the
lost wins the sympathy of the audience. If, in the proposed
duel, he were yet a bit more serious, for he is meant to
be plucky enough, he would win on his audience still more,
and the previous foolishness of the character would be condoned
and pardoned. As the nameless lieutenant, Mr. BERNARD
GOULD is admirable. He is the rough-and-ready soldier of duty
and honour, straightforward, with heart in right place. What
a Marcel in The Huguenots would not Mr. BERNARD GOULD make!
Such a Marcel would he worth his weight in Gould.
As Benée, Miss WINIFRED EMERY is charming, and the shades
of sudden changes of temper, in hating yet fondly loving,
doubting yet doting, are clearly defined by the actress, who
carries the audience with her throughout. Miss EVA MOORE is
nice, and sufficiently frightened. Clon, the dummy, a neces-
sary evil, is a very difficult part carefully played by Mr.
HOLMAN CLARK. The scenery is excellent. But, for excep-
tional effect, that of the Great Gallery in the Cardinal's Palace,
painted by Mr. HARKER, is the best thing of the sort since
the great scene in The Cup at the Lyceum. Everybody con-
gratulates Messrs FREDERICK HARRISON and CYRIL MAUDE on

EDIMBOURG.
DEAR MISTER,—Until here I have forgotten of to send to you
my notes ou the "north grey metropolis," that I visited at the
month of July. I regret him much. However, I may say,
"Better too lute than never." It is true that the Scottish say
that theu- country is not comprised in the England, but for we
othar French it is the same thing.
The first thing that a voyager of to-day sees in a town is not,
as other times, the gates, the principal streets, and perhaps
some of the monuments, from the imperial or from the cut of the
diligence, but the station of the railway. And partout the
stations are some edifices enough hideous. In effect I think
that more the town ú beautiful, more the station is horrible.
By example, at Venise! But of all the stations that I have ever
seen, the station of Waverley at Edimbourg is absolutely, and
without any doubt, the most hideous, the most horrible, and the
ni"-: unconveuient. Not only that, she is situated au beau
milieu, at tha beautiful middle—and in this case beau is not
only an augmentative, but expresses also the beauty—of a city
whose site is truly remarkable. And not only that, the station
is actually since longtime in state of reconstruction, and there
is so little of progress in the works that they have the air of never
to be finished. One descends from the train, and immediately
one finds a chaos of planks, of poles, and of scaffoldage, and
naturally between them some étangs, some pool-,, without
number, because the provisory roofs admit the rain who falls
so often. The voyager falls also. There is no more of quay,
nor of office, nor of room of wait, nothing but some miserable
sheds, at some enormous distances one from the other, almost
some kilomètres, which he must to traverse à pas de course, at
step of course, in leaping by above the planks, the coles, and
the pools—a veritable "steplechase." And all that in follow-
ing a Scottish factor, facteur, who speaks not englishl C'est
assommant!
Eh well, I arrive to this charming station, and when I have
enough admired her, I go to one of the hotels in the Prince
Street. 1 leave my baggages, and, the rain having ceased, I
make a little promenade the long of the street. Truly she is
admirable, as street, resembling a little to the Rue de Rivoli,
houses of one side, gardens of the other, but much more pic-
turesque. The blow of the eye of the castle on the rock is
superb, and the gardens are charming. But all is spoilt by the
horrible railway in the valley. Qufl dommage, what damage I
After the dinner at the hotel—pas gra nd'chose en effet, not
great thing in effect—I walk myself of new, and I seek some
divertisemunt for the evening. l'as de café, not of coffee, not
of music, not of proin'-nade, nothing! In fine I arrive to a
"music hall." A la bu/nie heure! See there the place for to
study the music of the Scottish, the "bagpipe." I enter im-
mediately and I rest f-nme time. Figure to yourself, Mister
Punch, that there, in the principal hall of music of the Scottish
metropolis, one finds absolutely not one sole "bagpip"! The
orchestra, tho songs, the music, the assistance, are precisely
as in England—perhaps a little more sad, if that can himself.
All desolated and fatigued I return to the hotel, and I couch
myself. For to sleep P I hope it. Attendez!

DEAR Ми. PUNCH, — Monte Cristo, the new ballet founded
upon DUMAS' romance, is a distinct success at the Empire. It
is true that about two-thirds (or even three-fourths, or perhaps
nine-tenths) of it is spectacle, and the remainder story. But
for all that, the plot is the guinea stamp and the dancing is
the entertainment (as BURNS would say), "for all that and all
that." However, as one triumpn makes many, another pro-
ductian on the same lines may be confidently expected before
the close of the present century. If there is any difficulty about
a scenario, I can give one. How would this do?

ABOUT THE RED ROBE.
A CHANGE has come over the spirit of Managers, and therefore
of Playwrights, as distinguished from Original Dramatists. The
Problem Play and the Ibsenitish Woman, the modern fashion-
able accessories, the whiskies-and-soda drinking, the perpetual
cigarette-smoking, the rude repartees of sharp Society folk, all
these are temporarily shelved, and the drama comes again before
us in its romantic phase with a clean bill of health, so that no
longor will the "Young Person" be excluded from the audi-
torium.
What are the odds against old Drury Lane, after the panto-
mime carnival is over, returning to the HALLIDAY times of
SCOTT'S novels dramatised? Nothing more likely, unless DUMAS,
or the works of one of the modern Dumas-lings in fiction, be
chosen for adaptation. ANTHONY HOPE—anything but a forlorn

WHEN you see before you an attractive-looking volume,
brought out by the combined efforts of Messrs. HODDER and
STOUGHTON, as though STOUGHTON couldn't have ventured upon
such a proceeding without HODDER, or any Hodder man, nor
HODDKR, which, of course, is hodder still, without the assistance of
STOUOHTON, and when you see that the author of the book in
question is Mr. H. W. LUCY, our TOBY, or, we may boldly assert,
the TOBY, without whom in the Gallery no Parliament is perfect,
you will settle yourself down in an easy chair, giving yourself
as much time as possible for the perusal of what apparently is a
novel in one volume, entitled, The Miller's Niece, but which
turns out to be a volume of tales (" Toby's Tales "—an excellent
title!) writ by the accomplished raconteur aforesaid. The
Miller's Niece is the first of mese stories, told with such graphic
touches when dealing with mere accessories, as forcibly to re-
mind you of DICKENS at his lightest and best. The dramatic
situation in The Miller's Niece is akin to that in the Erckmann-
Chatrian story of "Le Juif Polonais." Mathias, in the latter,
is hypnotised, and rehearses his crime in action; in this, the
Miller, walking in his sleep, does precisely the same thing. It
may occur to some that the story would have been more perfect
had it not been completed. But—quite good enough as it is.
The story of the Colonel is charming. The Baron's only regret
is, that this rough-and-ready "true grit" man should ever have
been presented at Court, and should have so far been influenced
by snobbism as to belittle his dear niece Kitty's hand by a
flunkevish comparison. One of the beet is "From the Chapel
Roof. If after the exertions of the day you have only a short
time left you before dressing for dinner, read the last-named
story, and tell it to your convives as your own experience.
The Temple Shakspeare is now completed by the publication
of the sonnete. There is no better small edition of the Divine
WILLIAM'S entire works, plays, poems, and sonnets, with
erudite prefaces, practical glossaries, and most useful notes,
than is issued by Messrs. DENT & Co., Aldine House, avail-
ing themselves of the "Cambridge" edition, by kind permission
student can easily pocket any two of them, honestly, of course,
carrying them with less discomfort than he would a small
cigar-case or note-book, and during his travels he will have
in his pocket two delightful travelling-companions, ever ready
to converse with him when others are silent, always instruc-
tivOj ever suggestive, never for one second dull. "A most con-
venient and invaluable series," quoth the Baron.
A more picturesque, dramatically-tragic, that is, as far as
concerns the first part of the story, and altogether more ab-
sorbingly interesting novel than Taquisara it would be difficult to
find, even among the works of its author, Mr. MARION CRAW-
FORD. He is thoroughly at home in Italy; he knows it and
its society, from the highest to the lowest, better than CHARLKS
LEVER knew Ireland, and as well as CARLETON knew Irish
peasant Ufe. The author has created a charming heroine, the
Princesa Veronica. The portrait sketch of Cardinal Campo-
donico is admirable. The journey of the Princess by rail and
road, and the sketches of the peasantry, are rare examples of
picturesque descriptive-writing. The reader feels it to be the
work of a truthful, simple, and sympathetic writer. There is a
strangely powerful scene of death and marriage; but how all
ends, whether happily or not, it is not for me to reveal; it is for
the reader to discover. Only one question arises, and that is
of fact. But probably Mr. MARION CRAWFORD has consulted
the highest authorities, and has satisfied his own literary con-
science. If "the essence of marriage is consent," with or with-
out witnesses, with or without ecclesiastical benediction, then
what becomes of the difficulty he has imagined P Thus: A. and
B. agree to be married. If A., meaning to marry В., accident-
ally takes C.'s hand, while a third party, priest or layman, pro-
nounces the words of union, surely A. is not married to C.?
However, apart from this, the novel, published by Messrs. MAC-
MILLAN, is delightful, and its perusal is a real recreation. At
least, so thinks and says THE BARON DB B.-W.

Miller, walking in his sleep, does precisely the same thing. It
may occur to some that the story would have been more perfect
bad it not been completed. But—quite good enough as it is.
The story of the Colonel is charming. The Baron's only regret
is, that this rough-and-ready "true grit" man should ever have
been presented at Court, and should have so far been influenced
by snobbism as to belittle his dear niece Kitty'* hand by a
tinukcvisЬ comparison. One of the beet is "From the Chapel
Roof. If after the exertions of the day you have only a short
time left you before dressing for dinner, read the last-named
etory, and tell it to your convivef as your own experience.
The Temple Shakspeare is now completed by the publication
of the sonnete. There is no better small edition of the Divine
WILLIAM'S entire works, plays, poems, and sonnets, n it!,
erudite prefaces, practical glossaries, and most useful notes,
than is issued by Messrs. DENT & Co., Aldine House, avail-
ing themselves of the "Cambridge " edition, by kind permission
student can easily pocket any two of them, honestly, of course,
carrying them with less discomfort than he would a small
cigar-case or note-book, and during his travels he will have
in his pocket two delightful travelling-companions, ever ready
to converse with him when others are silent, always instruc-
tivOj ever suggestive, never for one second dull. "A most con-
venient and invaluable series," quoth the Baron.
A more picturesque, dramatically-tragic, that is, as far as
concerns ti»1 first part of the story, and altogether more ab-
sorbingly interesting novel than Taquisara it would be difficult to
find, even among the works of its author, Mr. MARION CRAW-
FORD. He is thoroughly at home in Italy . he knows it and
its society, from the highest to the lowest, better than CHARLES
LEVER knew Ireland, and as well as CARLETON knew Irish
peasant Ufe. The author has created a charming heroine, the
Princess Veronica. The portrait sketch of Cardinal Campo-
donico is admirable. The journey of the Princess by rail and
road, and the sketches of the peasantry, are rare examples of
picturesque descriptive-writing. The reader feels it to be the
work of a truthful, simple, and sympathetic writer. There is a
strangely powerful scene of death and marriage; but how all
ends, whether happily or not, it is not for me to reveal; it is for
the reader to discover. Only one question arises, and that is
of fact. But probably Mr. MARION CRAWFORD has consulted
the highest authorities, and has satisfied his own literary con-
science. If "the essence of marriage is consent," with or with-
out witnesses, with or without ecclesiastical benediction, then
what becomes of the difficulty he has imagined? Thus: A. and
B. agree to be married. If A., meaning to marry В., accident-
ally takes C.'s hand, while a third party, priest or layman, pro-
nounces the words of union, surely A. is not married to C.?
However, apart from this, the novel, published by Messrs. M ч
MiLLAN, is delightful, and its perusal is a real recreation. At
least, so thinks and says Тнв BARON D» B.-W.

MY DEAR JACK,—I promised to write to you as soon as I got
back to London, and here is the letter. I noticed that, when
I spoke of writing with such haste, you looked at me with some
curiosity. Naturally, you wondered what more I could have to
say to you after we had spent the best part of three days to-
gether in Cambridge, and after I had, as it must have seemed to
you, exhausted all that even a prosy uncle can have to say to
a nephew just embarked upon hie freshman's voyage. But
honestly, JACK, I think you will find when you cast back in
your memory that, though we talked a great deal, I did not
speak much of the place, nor did I try to depress your bubbling
spirits with any weight of avuncular advice. I did, indeed, ask you
to remember that you were a ROUNDABOUT, and that in all things
that concerned the bearing of a man you could have no better
guide and example than your memory of your father, one of the
best and staunchest as he was one of the truest and most loyal
men that ever lived. He was my brother, and I loved him.
That sounds a simple and a natural thing to say—but is it so?
Is it not too often the case that such a relationship—and, in
truth, almost any relationship, save that between child and
parent—is a barrier rather than a link? Courtesy and tolerance
there may be, but affection is a different matter. However,
all that is not to the point. What I wanted to say was this:
When I was with you in that dear old town I meant to talk to
you—my heart wa-s full, but the thoughts were ill-defined, and
the words would not come. Don't tear up this letter under
the impression that it's going to be what we used to call a
"pi-jaw." It isn't; but the sight of Cambridge once more,
and in your company, affected me strangely, and, in short, I
want to write to you, my dear boy, and free my heart.
I was glad to go with you, and to see you make your start.
It refreshes an old chap to plunge into that sea of young faces,
to hear the old familiar sounds, the footsteps hurrying arco&s
the court at night, the bells ringing to hall or chapel—you carp
at the bells, now, no doubt, but you don't know how instantly
and vividly they brought back a troop of old delightful associa-
tions to me. It was as if a curtain had been drawn, and the
once more, and with all the proud awe of a freshman, through
these ancient sacred haunts. Every bell told its story and
brought back a well-known face till the court was peopled again
with my friends, and the tumble-down staircases resounded to
their calls. Across the gulf of years I heard them plainly, and
for a moment I lived again the old gay, free, enchanted life as
though nothing had been changed, and fate had not scattered
us all irrevocably to the four winds of heaven. We were much
the same, I take it, as you and your fellows are now—more
prim, it may be, in our costume, less addicted to cloth caps,
but in all essentials, in our spirits, our manners, and in our
youth we must have been as you are. And yet, till I saw you
all in chapel that evening, I never realised how gloriously young
we wore in spite of the emphatic manhood which we had as-
sumed with our caps and gowns. As you and I came from
chapel, a half mist lay wrapped round the court and its grey
pinnacles and towers, and the lights twinkled away into the
distance while the throng of youngsters moved along. That
was Cambridge in October. They may talk as they like about
the May Term, when the days grow long and the skies are
clear, and the avenues are rich in the freshness of their leaves,
but to me Cambridge in the October Ten« is the real Cam-
bridge. Then better than at any other time, in those long
evenings when the darkness comes down and blurs the outlines,
or when the moon lays a soft and hazy light on the gateways
and lawns and fountains, you seem to get that impression of
vague mystery that lingers about old buildings, the feeling of
hoary and venerable tradition renewed by abounding youth,
of tottering age refreshed by strenuous life and vigour. That
is the Cambridge of my dreams, and that to me is the real
Cambridge.
And what, after all, are thirty years? To you looking forward
their length seems infinite, incalculable. You think that when
you shall have accomplished them you will be a broken-down old
felloWj with all your joy, your keenness, your exuberance thrust
away into the past, with only a few melancholy years still left
to you for the living of a grooved and humdrum existence. But
to me, as I look back to my freshman's day, they seem as a
wind that has blown and touched my cheek in passing, and
life still seems full and fresh and delightful. We realise advanc-
ing age by starts and surprises. A twinge in the back, a stiff-
ness ш the knee-joint—what are these? A spin in an out-
rigger, a bout with the foils will soon chase them. But they
are not chased so easily, and in the morning, when you stand
inexorable years had rolled back, and I wandered, a freshman
at your looking-glass confessional, and do penance with your

razor, you may notice a gray patch or so where formerly all was
black or brown, and the little network of lines that many
years of repeated smiles have stamped about your eyes. And
the youngsters treat you with a deference that is almost dis-
agreeable, though you would think them unmannerly if they
abandoned it. You are no longer slapped heartily on the back,
your ribs receive no more familiar digs, and you n-arvel as
you watch two of your nephew's friends chasing and tripping,
and disarranging and battering one another, with shouts of
laughter as though nothing in the whole world could be so
amusing as to bruise or be bruised by a familiar friend. Still,
we are not old—shall we ever be ?—and when we meet together,
as we sometimes do, at festivals and celebrations, we are apt
to say, with OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES,
Has there any old fellow got mixed with the boys )
If there has, tnke him out without making и noise.
If you are not acquainted with the works of this kind and
friendly American, get them at once and read them. You will
find in them a truer refreshment and a serener wisdom than in all
the ponderous volumes of the philosophers. And here let me ob-
serve, by way of parenthesis, that when I was in Cambridge, I saw
my old bedmakerand my gyp. My dear JACK, bedmakers and gyps
never grow older. Something there must be in their occupa-
tions that keeps them immovably fixed at a certain point of
life. These two familiar faces were not altered by a single lino
from my memory of them. Mrs. WRIQLET'S well-worn shawl
hung on its accustomed nail, the same shawl, to all outward
appearance, that used always to stray mysteriously into coal-
boxes or cupboards. Her voice was the same. She came to
greet me, bearing the same old tin dish-cover in one hand,
and the same piece of cracked crockery in the other, and she
still complained that Cambridge was not what it used to be,
and that two brass fardens would cover all that was spent daily
in foaJ upon her staircase. She will never change and never
die. Someday she will cease to be. A company of ghostly
spirit her away to a place where there are no tables to be laid
and no beds to be made, and where there are no tradesmen's
boys to offer her any impudent suggestions.
Good-bye, my dear boy. Your affectionate uncle,

ILLOGICAL CONDEMNATION.—Experiments with the Znlinski
pneumatic gun were recently tried at Milford Haven, which is
a haven all very nice for Cymbeline's Imogen, but not for a quiet
visitor when gun practising is going on, and the result was that
the Zalinski gun made only one hit out of seventeen rounds.
So, observed a naval correspondent in the Globe, "the gun can-
not be considered a success." Ahem! But suppose Mr.
WINKLE SNODGRASS ZALINSKI, out with a shooting party, nit
only one partridge in seventeen shots, would every one at once
declare that tjie fault lay with the weapon, and not with Mr.
WINKLE SNODGRASS ZALINSKI? Of course, ZALINSKI himself
would say so, just as Mr. WINKLE, not shooting, remarked
about his skates. Probably the gun is not a success, but this
decision is not to be arrived at by the reasoning aforesaid.
FRESH WATER AND NEW NAME.—Works to purify the River
Ure were recently inaugurated by Lord RIPON, Marquis and
Mayor. It is to be hoped that they are of those "good works"
which do not go unrewarded. And when the river purified
shall begin to run afresh its new course, let its name be changed
to what sounds ordinarily like a tu-quoque retort, and be called
bedmakers will come on an evening when her work is done and
"Ure Another," which it will be, quite another.

my old bedmaker and my gyp. My dear JACK, bedmakersand gyps
never grow older. Something there must be in their occupa-

from my memory of them. Mrs. WRIGLET'S well-worn shawl
hung on its accustomed nail, the same shawl, to all outward
appearance, that used always to stray mysteriously into coal-
boxes or cupboards. Her voice was the same. She came to
greet me, bearing the same old tin dish-cover in one hand,
and the same piece of cracked crockery in the other, and ehe
still complained that Cambridge was not what it used to be,
and that two brass fardens would cover all that was spent daily
in food upon her staircase. She will never change and never
die. Someday she will cease to be. A company of ghostly

ILLOGICAL CONDEMNATION.—Experimente with the Znjinski
pneumatic gun were recently tried at Milford Haven, which is
a haven all very nice for Cymbeline's Imogen, but not for a quiet
visitor when gun practising is going on, and the result was that
the Kalinski gun made only one hit out of seventeen rounds.
So, observed a naval correspondent in the Globe, "the gun can-
not be considered a success." Ahem! But suppose Mr.
WINKLE SNODGRASS ZALINSKI, out with a shooting party, nit
only one partridge in seventeen shots, would every one at once
declare that tie fault lay with the weapon, and not with Mr.
WINKLE SNODGKASB ZALINSKI? Of course, ZALINSKI himself
would say so, just as Mr. WINKLE, not shooting, remarked
about his skates. Probably the gun is not a success, but this
decision is not to be arrived at by the reasoning aforesaid.
FRBSH WATER AND NEW NAME.—Works to purify the River
Ure were recently inaugurated by Lord RIPON, Marquis and
Mayor. It is to be hoped that they are of those "good works"
which do not go unrewarded. And when the river purified
shall begin to run afresh its new course, let its name be changed
to what sounds ordinarily like a tu-quoque retort, and be called

DAEBY JONES ON TURF MATTERS.
HONOURED SIR,—You and your reader>
must now, indeed, be callous as to the
upheaval in the price of cereals. Whili
believing that the ever-resourceful Том
CANNON might fire an unexpected shot a'
the last moment, I nevertheless boldlj
proclaimed the probable victory of If ink-
field's i'ride in the Cambridgeshire. Ant)
of course it came off, as easily as does thi
gold foil of a champagne flask at the hands
of an expert. Nevertheless, I frankly
confess that I was fairly puzzled by the
way in which Mr. 3. C. SXTLUVAN'S chest-
nut colt was knocked about (metaphori-
cally) я few days before the contest. With
tears of anguish I remember that on the
previous Friday I twice refused to take
£1,000 to £5 about the Irishman's chance!
Think of that, honoured Sir! By my
egregious weakness with regard to my own
powers of divination, I have probably de-
prived myself of a glorious Winter of Con-
tent. Not but that sundry shekels have
been added to the wallet which I carry in
my pistol pocket, but I missed the grant!
coup, the Austerlitz or Waterloo of the
racing campaign, owing to the plausible
pleading of a "Fly-flat." No more piti-
able creature exists than this. He is, to
borrow a simile from the Wizard of the
North, the DuffoM Dalgrtty of modern
chivalry. Always thinking that he knows
to take advantage of the failings of
others, he is invariably captured and
stripped of all his possessions before he is
well aware of the fact. And yet by such
a Braggart, who professed to know я
Stable Secret, an Old Campaigner was in-
duced to abstain from raking in the plun-
der, which none-too-kind Fortune had
»gain placed at his disposal. I therefore im-
plore all noblemen and gentlemen to take
warning by my woeful example, and avoid
the "Fly-flat" as they would immature
whiskey, or tickets in a Hamburg lottery.
H" is pretty easy to recognise, and must
on no account be mistaken for "One of
the Boys," or that candidate for a paulo-
v»st-futuriim workhouse, the harmless,
but nerhaps necessary, " Mug." The "Fly
flat" is not only dangerous to himself,
but his existence is inimical to others.
That I should have been entrapped by his
specious birdlime proves that even a Solon
might be deceived by oaths, considerably
more veracious in quality than those em-
ployed in her Majesty's Courts of Equity
nnd Justice. Yes, Sir, even the most
knowing birds are occasionally "twigged."
For instance, Mr. ARTHVR COVENTRY,
after despatching large fields of silken
jackets with faultless celerity, had to
return home on the Cambridgeshire day
minus his well-appointed, and, I doubt
not. well-lined, overcoat.
Newmarket is, I take it, the Metropolis
must be the equine Houses of Lords and
Commons rolled into one, while always in
the Birdcage flit hither and thither the
most radiantly-clad bipeds that ever de-
lighted the eyeballs of man. Neverthe-
less, it seems to me that the Jockey Club,
Monarchs and Masters of all they survey,
resemble that old lady who, on arriving
at forked roads, was undecided as to hei
course of travel. Either the Jockey Club
wants to keep its meetings Select, and
available only for the Honoured Few who
form Upper-Ten Society, or else it desires
to attract to the Heath the Many who are
not slow to repay Considerate Hospitality
with £ .1. d. If the former be the object
of the Club, it is as successful as were the
Japanese ironclads in the late far Eastern
war. If the latter, I, with all humility,
aver that the Stewards go the wrong way
to work.
I believe that the eminent firm of BER-
TRAM cater for the unseen, but always
craving, inner man, both at Newmarket
and Kempton Park. I will guarantee that
were Messrs. JOHN and WILLIAM examined
before a Select Committee of Turfites
they could point out the horrible gulf of
non-accommodation which is placed be-
tween the Jockey Club Show at New-
market and that so sagaciously governed
by Mr. S. H. HYDE from his Elizabethan
Castle by the Thames. Indeed, honoured
Sir, I fancy that yon yourself might give
valuable testimony, for, if my waning eye-
sight did not deceive me, I could swear
that an aristocratic gentleman who
lighted his choice Havana with a five-
pound note after the victory of Vr.mtrian
in the Dewhurst Plate, was none other
than mon rédacteur princier. My know-
ledge of the Gallic tongue is, I may add,
mainly derived from a French marquis,
who stood to win £20,000 over Omnium

his return journey to his native land from

tions of these pocket-books (which are all
pocketable, that is, after legitimate pur-
chase, when they become presentable),
are sometimes magnificent, often interest-
ing, and occasionally touching. Thus
how spacious must be the Imperial Pocket,
which can hold "Russia," and, next in
size, "Morocco." How strong could be
the interest that every admirer of such
books as Alice in Wonderland or of Sand-
ford and Merton would take in ordering
a specimen of "Polished Crocodile." How
the tender-hearted would willingly ex-
pend six shillings in comforting "Crushed
Morocco." That "Cloth limp" should be
set down as "Fast" conveys a moral.

vantageous terms, :by Destiny to the mor-
tal purchaser. From experience, Mr.

race. The other day at Hamburg he loosed a splendid Russian-
German cat from his bag, which caused great wonder in all
European menageries. It was originally an unsuspected member
of the Triple Happy Family, which Prince B. formerly managed,
but its presence was wholly unsuspected by the Austrian Eagle
and the Italian Buffalo. It is believed, moreover, that the great
showman has several other equally startling specimens of kindred
race, but he sincerely regrets that he has no Anglo-Teutonic
freak in his collection. At least one Imperial authority inclines
to the idea that Prince B. is afflicted with Katzen-jammer, and
wishes that he would retire to Heligoland.

Тнв Public will be astounded at the news (which came with
the perfect novelty of a surprise upon this insignificant self) that
I have ceased to be the cherished guest beneath the hired Scottish
roof of Mister LEOFRIC ALLBUTT-ÏNNETT and his bucksome lady.
It fell out after this fashion.
One fine September morning, when I was accoutring myself
in order to go out and hunt the robert (N.B. a genuine local
Scut tic-ism for individuals belonging to the rabbit genius), there
came to me my young friend HOWARD, who was to teach my
young idea how to shoot, in great gloom, asking me if it would
take me a prolonged period to pack up my impedimenta.

I replied that I could do the trick instantaneously, inquiring
the reason for his question.
"Because," said he, "if I were you, I should have a wire re-
quiring me to come up to London at once."
"From my solicitor?" I inquired. "Is he then desirous of
consulting with me?"
My friend answered me that it was the one object of his
present existence.
"In that case," said I, rather spiritedly, " let him come up here,
since I am not a mountain that I should obey the becking call of
any Mahomet. Moreover, I am impatient to achieve the de-
struction of some Scottish roberte."
"If you will take my advice," he said, "you will grant them a
reprieve, and make a scarcity of yourself. There ie a train for
Glasgow which you can just catch. I wouldn't distress the Mater
and Governor by any farewells, you know."
"But," I objected, "I am not even in receipt of any telegram.
Nor can I possibly omit the etiquette of a ceremonious leave-
taking with your honourable parents."
"Just as you please," replied he. "Just now the Governor
and Mater are in the front sitting-room, engaped in perusing the
back numbers of your precious 'Jossers and Tidlers' or whatever
you call 'em, which have been thoughtfully forwarded by a rela-
tive. I don't think I 'd disturb them."
assuming penna?" I cried, with the gratified simpering of a
nattered.
"It looked like it when I left the room," said he; "the Mater
was very near rolling on the oilcloth, and the Governor dancing
and foaming from his mouth. What an awfully old ass you have
been, JAB, to go and blurt out everything in print—about your
breach of promise case, and getting to know us, and—worst of
all—being merely a bogey prince. Naturally, we don't care
about being made to look fools. The dear old Mater, you know,
is one of those simple, trusting natures that, if they once dis-
cover they have been taken in by a sham title, why, they
kick up the row of a deuce! And, as for the Governor, he 's the
sort of old retiring chap that has a downright loathing of pub-
licity, when it makes him ridiculous. If he came across you just
now, there 's really no saying what he mightn't do. He 's such
a devilishly hot-tempered old boy!"
I did not comprehend the reasons for such exuberant anger,
but, of course, young HOWABD insisted so urgently on physical
dangers to myself if I delayed, that I hastened stealthily to my
room by a backstair, and flinging my paraphernalia with incred-
ible despatch into a portmanteau, was so fortunate as to convey
it out or the house without attracting the invidious attention of
my host and hostess, who were probably still occupied in foam-
ing and rolling upon the carpet like angry waves of the sea.
Young HOWARD accompanied me to the station, though blam-
ing me as the cause of his embroilment with his progenitors, who,
it seems, had insisted—quite unjustly—that he must have known
from the first that my nobility was merely a brevet rank; and
Miss WEE-WEB bade me farewell with a soft and perfectly lady-
like cordiality, being too grieved by my departure to make any
allusion to the head and front of my offending.
Now I am once more in London, paying daily visits of several
hours to the office of my solicitor, in order to assist him in the
preparation of my brief.
The other day, Baboo JALPANYBHOY and Baboo CHUCKER-
lui ri Y RAM attended for the purpose of arranging their evidence,
when I regret to say the former made a rather paltry exhibition
of himself, being declared by Mr. SMARTLE himself to be totally
incompetent to prove anything whatever material to the case,
and I am therefore resolved to refuse him admission to the
witness-box.
I am more hopeful of Mr. CHUCKERBUTTY RAM, who, I think,
after diligent coaching from myself, may be induced to restrain
nia natural garrulity, and speak no more than is set down for
him, which is simply that I have already, in his presence, con-
tracted matrimony with a juvenile native, and that the laws
of my country entitle me to marry several more.
This is in support of one of my most subtle pleadings of defence,
to wit, that I have already offered to marry the plaintiff accord-
ing to my country's laws, but that she did definitely decline such a
marriage as polygamous, (which it is indubitably liable to be-
come at any moment,) consequently, that my said contract is
nilled by mutual consent.
Mr. SMARTLE was of the opinion that the plaintiff's solicitors
would move to strike out such a pleading as bad in law, since it
is no defence to an action for breach of promise that the defend-
ant is already the Benedick. Fortunately they have omitted
to do this, and I anticipate exciting excessive admiration in Court
by the ingenuity of my arguments from Analogy, Common
Sense, Roman Law, &c.
My said solicitor has also communicated with Hon'ble Sir
CHETWYND CUMMERBUND, to inquire if he would consent to ap-
pear as a witness to my dependent filial condition, and entire
lack of the sinews of war; which, with fatherly kindness, he hae
agreed to do, and, as he rather humorously puts it, convince
the jury that I am the good riddance of bad rubbish.
Now the decks are cleaned for action, and all is ready for the
forensic logomachy as soon as it may please Providence and some
associate in the Queen's Bench Division to place the suit of
ManJdeiow v. Jabber-jre. in the list of causes for the day.
My solicitors advice, which I shall very probably adopt, is to
keep as close as possible to the issues, and more especially to the
point that, if I gave any promise to marry at all, it was extorted
from me by threats of bodily violence which reduced me to a
blue funkiness.
Also he recommends that I am not to attempt any golden-
mouthed eloquence, thereby making the lamentable exhibit
of a most stupendous ignorance of human nature!
For what can melt the stony hearts of men, causing them to
bellow like an ox and become tender as chickens, or what can
rouse them to Indignation, Approval, Contempt, Wonderment,
and every other known sentiment as required, so effectively as the

Well soon I find that I have beautiful to couch myself, I have

All simply at cause of the insupportable noises of the detestable
trains, there in face. I have beautiful to turn myself, I have
beautiful to cover myself the ears, all is unuseful, I sleep
not of the whole. All the night, absolutely without cease, I
hear th.î whistlings, the rollings, the noises. Of time in time I
lift myself, and for to repose myself, I walk myself of long in
large and I regard by the window, which gives on the valley and
on the castle. A beautiful view, but I have enough of her, I
assure you of it I I see her in effect by night, by the feeble
light of the crépuscule, at the point of day, and in full day,
without the least relaxation of the meres bruits en bas, the

himself, to pass the night even in a Spanish train, than in a

à coucher, parbleu! I arrive too soon, the apartments are not
yet open, I must attend. In attending I see to pass some brave
soldiers, some "Hihlanders," of the "Blackvatch." Ah, what
droll of costume! But the men are magnificent. I hear also a

not more of her! In fine I visit the apartments, and then I
go to the Cathedral. I enter rapidly, being pressed, and at the
instant that I mount the marches of the portal, a man, seated
at a table, arrests me with some crys. He demands three
pennys of entrance. What droll of church! And the good man
cried himself so much of violence, because he feared of to lose
the pennys, that which would be insupportable for a Scottish.

I knew not that he must to pay, I pay volunteerly, but be polite

JOTTINGS AND TITTLINGS.

No. XXVII.
Mr. Jabberjec is unavoidably compelled to return to town, thereby affording
Ais Solicitor the inestimable benefit of his personal assistance. An
apparent attemvt to pack the Jury.
TUB Public will be astounded at the news (which came with
the perfect novelty of a surprise upon this insignificant self) that
I have ceased to be the cherished guest beneath the hired Scottish
roof of Mister LEOFRIC ALLBUTT-INNKTT and his buckeome lady.
It fell out after this fashion.
One fine September morning, when I was accoutring myself
in order to go out and hunt the robert (N.B. a genuine local
Scotticism for individuals belonging to the rabbit genius), there
came to me my young friend HOWAKD, who was to teach my
young idea how to shoot, in great gloom, asking me if it would
take me a prolonged period to pack up my impedimenta.

I replied that I could do the trick instantaneously, inquiring
the reason for his question.

PHIL MAT'S Gutter Snipes, which are
veritable " snipe-shots," taken on the spot,
and every one of them a hit, is the best
collection of genuinely humorous pic-
tures from the London streets that can
be seen anywhere. Every figure in it
is a type recognisable by all Londoners.
The humour is comic, grim, pathetic.
It depends solely on the drawing, unas-
sisted by dialogue. They are, indeed,
"Living Pictures." They have been
brought out in one handsome volume by
the Leadenhall Press, Limited, and should
have an unlimited circulation.
The pictures in Nonsense for Somebody,
Anybody, and Eivrybmly, written and
illustrated by A Nnbmly, are eccentric
and amusing, and a dash of colour adds to
possibly have suggested the illustrations,
are not up to the pictures, and cannot
for a moment be compared with those
ancient ones of King Lear in this particu-
lar line, and of this particular sort of line.
It is brought out by GARDNER, DARTON &
Co., of Paternoster Buildings.
The first volume of The Political Life
of William Ev/art Gladstone—"a noble
volume" Lord ROSEBERY calls it—brings
a marvellous career up to the end of the
Session of 1876, which, at the moment all
unknowing, witnessed the withdrawal of
Mr. DISRAELI from the House of Commons.
Mr. Punch, of whose many sterling quali-
ties modesty is not least marked, feels
some delicacy in writing about the work
of his own progeny. Happily he is re-
lieved by no less an authority than the
Prime Minister from the task of describing
the work. "It is valuable," writes Lord
SALISBURY, "as a record of successive
phases of political feeling, and to one who
can remember those times, it is full of
interesting reminiscences." That's about
it, all packed into a sentence. It may
perhaps be added that for a younger gene-
ration who cannot remember the times,
here is rare opportunity of seeing how
they looked beheld through keen, ob-
servant eyes. With something of a
shock of surprise my Baronite is re-
minded that Mr. GLADSTONE'S Parliament-
ary career began nine years before Mr.
Punch, by the issue of his first number,
formally assumed kindly charge of the
affairs of the Universe. Once at his post
he took note of young GLADSTONE, and
for the last fifty years there are few of
his weekly numbers that have not con-
tained some pictorial note of this wonder-
ful life. The first tiuie Mr. GLADSTONE
was pictured in Punch was in the Session
of 1059, when he interposed in debate on
the Reform Bill of that year. It is a
slight sketch, illustrating a Homeric ver-
sion of the debate, in which reference is
made to "the Classic GLADSTONE." His
first appearance in a full-page cartoon is
in connection with his Budget in 1861. He
is presented as the dentist in attendance on
Master BULL, comforting the apprehensive
youth with assurance that so far from
extracting any more teeth in the way of
income-tax he means to remit a penny.
Thereafter, through all the changes of a
bustling life, Mr. GLADSTONE periodically
re-appears. It is interesting to wateh,
as the years pass, how the side-whiskers
disappear, the hair grows more scanty
over the lofty brow, the wrinkles deepen
on the mobile face, the tall, slim figure
begins to droop, the decades, as they
accumulate, carrying him farther and
farther away from the cast and stamp
of the dark-haired, bright - faced, dis-
tinguished-looking young man whose
portrait prefaces the volume. This is
an engraving from the picture taken
by W. BRADLEY of Mr. GLADSTONE in his
twenty-eighth year, which to-day hangs in

the volume are, of course, unique. The
letterpress is a masterpiece of lucid con-
densation, marked by judicial tone rare

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

FANCY PICTURE REPRESENTING SOME "LIVER-Y MEN" OF THE CITY OF LONDON!
THE DAY AFTER THE GUILDHALL BANQUET.
SARK ON SULPHUROUS WATERS.
EXTRACTS FROM THE TRAVEL HIAUY OF TOBY, M.P.
Harrogate. Monday.—"It's very curious," said the Membei
for Sark, with a faraway look in his eyes.
"What is curious?" I asked, gently.
SARK is, I fear only temporarily, a changed man. What Mem-
bers on the other side of the House of Commons used indifferently
to call arrogance, oensoriousness, or dogmatism, has disappeared.
Remarkable what effective solvent for these qualities are two
twelve-ounce tumblers of strong "Old" sulphur water, taken
before breakfast, followed at intervals later in the day by two
eight-ounce tumblers of chalybeate, totting up with twenty
minutes' stew in strong sulphur bath, heated to 98 degrees.
"It's curious," SARK continued, with just the slightest sus-
picion of accustomed acerbity, "how, dealing with identical per-
sons suffering from precisely the same diseases, real or imagined,
methods of treatment and personal customs vary at different
watering-places. At Aix-les-Bains, for example, having had your
bath, you are carefully bundled up in blankets till you closely
resemble a mummy. Two men enter the bath-room carrying a
sort of sedan chair. Into this you are lifted; another twist is
given to your blankets; the curtains are closed; you are carried
off to your hotel, dropped into your bed (or somebody else's) and
there left for twenty minutes—not a second less, not a beat of
the pendulum more. I think, cher Tabee, you once told a story
of an incursion of one of these bundles into your bedroom at
Aix-les-Bains?"
I blushed as I recalled how, standing one morning at the
window of my bachelor room in the Hotel Splendide, feasting my
eyes on the azure plain of Lake Bourget, and the jagged roof-tree
of the mountains that girdle it, the door opened. Two men
entered with sedan chair; set it on the floor; turned down the
bedclothes—my bedclothes—and bundled into my bed a portly
French not being that of Aix-lee-Bains, they had misunderstood
her instructions, and conveyed her to the wrong room.
But that is another story, and if SARK had only had a third
twelve-ounce tumbler of what here is always affectionately
alluded to as "Old" sulphur, he would have been too depressed
to have hunted up the reminiscence.
"Well," continued SARK, " what I mean is this. According to
the rule at Aix-les-Bains, after taking a bath, otherwise under
precisely the same conditions as at Harrogate, it is imperatively
required that for a while you lay up under the blankets. At
Bath the same principle obtains to the extent that having
stewed for the ordered time in a hot bath, you sit for a quarter
of an hour in the cooling-room. There is the alternative, also
recalling the custom at Aix-les-Bains, that at Bath you may be
carefully wrapped up and sent home in a bath-chair, with in-
structions to lie down to cool off. Neither at Harrogate nor
at Homburg is there any such observance. As soon as you
have had your bath, the attendants, so to speak, call the watch
together, let you go, and thank Heaven they are rid of a rogue.
"Then there 's drinking water. At Aix-les-Bains there is no
water to drink, consequently you don't drink it. At Bath a
tumbler of water is incidentally served whilst you sit in the cool-
ing room. Also there is a pump-room, where inoffensive water
is taken in moderate quantities. But it is not, as at Homburg,
Aix-la-Chapelle, and Harrogate, a leading feature in the
cure. At Homburg, some people take baths; all drink water.
The fashionable hour is 7 A.M., when the band under the trees
by the Elizabethan Brunnen hails smiling morn with a hymn
tune. Within half an hour the leafy allée is thronged with a
gay company, walking briskly up and down for the stipulated
fifteen minutes intervening between successive glasses of water.
In the miserable little garden enclosing the wells at Aix-la-
Chapelle, there is the same brisk walking to and fro, round and
round, to the strains of a beautiful band. Here they don't
female. Afterwards, the porters explained that, the lady's
commence with a hymn, but a touch of solemn respectability

и given to the proceedings by every man in the band wearing a
top hat. That is interesting as showing how serious a part of
the cure water drinking is regarded under some systems. At
Harrogate we take our water strong and often. But save during
a limited portion of the season we have no band, top batted or
otherwise; nor any long, leafy alee in which to stroll.
"Next consider the drinking utensils. At Homburg it is the
thing to have your own cup or glass, in which the water is drawn
for you. At Aix-la-Chapelle the same custom almost exclusively
prevails. In order to meet it, there are in the pump-room tiers
of hooks, each numbered, upon which the water drinker hangs
his cup when he has finished, and, arriving in the morning, goes
straightway to take it down. I remember one morning, at Aix-
la-Chapelle, a blustering German bullied the obliging maiden who
filled the tumblers, because on going to find his cup on his particu-
lar nail, lo ! it was not. She tremblingly went about till she came
upon it (where he had put it) on the wrong hook. Ah me, the
days that are no more! What a life I led that German. Every
morning I was at the pump-room, bright and early; found his
cup on its own particular peg; bore it off to a distant quarter;
hung it on an unappropriated hook. Then to see my friend
enter, stamp up to his hook, find it cuplees; to see him rage
round, Woerth blazing in his eyes, Sedan reddening; his tightly-
closed knuckles! It did me more good than all the waters of
Charlemagne's town!"
"That is still another story," I diffidently observed.
"Yes. Talking about cups, I was rather in them. I was going
to say that, neither at Bath nor here, is it the custom to bring
your own cup or glass. Then take towels. At all continental
watering-places towelling is a solemn function. \\'Ъеп the ap-
pointed time for concluding the bath is reached, the attendant
enters, bringing towels almost red hot from the oven. In one he
enfolds you and gently rubs you down. At Bath, this custom
ie followed to the extent of towels being brought in hot at the
conclusion of the bath. Here, the towels, rolled up and warmed
to begin with, are placed in your dressing-room when you enter,
ana thenceforward you look after yourself.
"Finally, as to diet. At Homburg, patients are dieted as
rigorously as they are watered. In most cases, as at Carlsbad,
butter is anathema. Eggs, dry bread and coffee for breakfast,
washed down by a moderate quantity of hock. At Aix-les-Bains,
strawberries are strictly forbidden. As in the season wild straw-
berries grow abundantly in the neighbourhood, they form the
principal feature at dessert. This serves a double debt to pay.
It exercises the boarder in self-restraint, and it makes the straw-
berries last a long time, to the profit of the hotel-keeper. At
Bath, I do not remember any restrictions upon diet, whilst at
Harrogate coffee, freely taken in identical cases in Homburg,
is one of the few articles of daily diet absolutely tabooed.
"Now, you know, dear TOBY, these manners and customs,
flatly contradicting each other, yet each in a particular place
held as essential to a cure, cannot all be right. What are we
poor trusting patients to do P"
"Better pay your money and take your choice,"Isaid,sooth-
ingly.
SARK was working himself up into a frame of mind incom-
patible with the twelve-ounce tumbler of "Old" sulphur at this
moment due.

A CAPITAL DODGE.
AMONT. HIS NATIVE BANKS OLD PODDLES TAKER A LOT OF BKATINO. HE SAYS THEKE 's
NOTHING EASIEK WHKN YOU KNOW HOW TO NEOorlATE 'EM.
DARBY JONES REFLECTS ON RACING.
HONOURED SIR, — There are moments
when a terrestrial angel is impelled by the
force of untoward circumstances to make
use of language which would scarcely be
permitted within the Palace of St. Ste-
phen's, Westminster, without л vehement
reproof from Mr. Speaker GULLY. Such
an incident occurred yesterday evening
when, just as I was about to refresh my-
self with a dish of Boheaand Green mixed,
accompanied by the succulent muffin, one
of your richly-liveried envssaries was an-
nounced. With customary courtesy he
handed me a large envelope superscribed
in my name, addressed to your editorial
castle, and marked "Immediate. Impor-
tant. Confidential." "This," I thought
to myself, "is no doubt some flattering
testimonial from one of my gratified cli-
ents," who are, alas! too scarce in propor-
tion to my well-known services. Having
dismissed your amb'issador, not without
a trifling token of my goodwill, I tore open
the cover! Then it was that, despite the
teaching of the Poet WATTS, my angry
passions rose, for the communication was
the Sinfulness of Betting, accompanied
by some far from sympathetic remarks
with regard to one RICHARD DÜNN, a layer
of odds in the ready money or cash over
| the counter style of business, an operator
whose magpie costume in days gone by
never failed to excite my wannest admira-
tion, and whose voice has ever struck me
j by its quality and sweetness to be well
fitted for filling such temples of the lyric
drama as Covent Garden Theatre, the
Grand Opera, Paris, or La Scala, Milan.
I understand that this unfortunate Mr.
DUNN, after having had the complaint
against him as laid out by the Anti-Gam-
bling League dismissed by the Kingston
Magistrates, is now to be brought into a
superior Court, where Ыч alleged iniqui-
ties will once more be subjected to the in-
spection of Themis, a goddess for whom I
have but little sympathy, but much re-
spect. It seems to me. Sir, that the con-
tinual object of Certain Parties in this
Realm is the Sacrifice of Sane Citizens for
thf Protection of the "Juggins" (or
"Mug "). Because there are a few thou-
sand Congenital Idiots, who get periodi-
cally overcome by excessive consumption
pretty little barley, and the merry hop,
these Parties urge us to shut up those
houses of refreshment which are, in my
opinion, so many watch towers of Consti-
tutional Freedom. Equally because these
same Parties are aware that there have
been instances of unscrupulous fools who
have ruined themselves by improvident
wagering, that therefore no Englishman
shall be privileged to back his fancy!
Was there ever a more preposterous and
uncharitable notion propounded, when
these very same Parties are, for aught I
know, playing the good old game of Bull
and Bear in that famous establishment
which has just shed a financial lustre on
the question of the Presidential Election
in the land of the Ever-soaring Eagle?
But if the "Juggins" (or "Mug") is to
be protected from the nefarious designs of
base individuals, let the Stewards of the
Jockey Club issue yearly licences to the
Knights of the Odds! ТяМ would not ob-
ject, I feel confident, for the Ring is like
a privileged railway-station yard, and the
smaller the competition, the better is it
for trade. And it wouldn't be a bad idea
to licence the Juggins, too. It is impos-
sible to be too <îreat-grandmotherly nowa-
days. The Lord Chief Justice, Sir HENRY
FTÀWKINS, and Sir FRANK LOCKWOOD -could
from their mighty and experienced brains
draw up such a perfect legal scheme that
in days to come anxious parents would
send their offspring to a Model Race
Course, in preference to allowing them to
waste their opportunities by the Isis or
the Cam! You will, I know, honoured
Sir, forgive this honest outburst. I have
not felt so indignant since one flight a
month ago, when, at what I imagined waa
a respectable Nan Reunion, I found my
neighbour, little BEN FERMINADAB, was in
the habit, when my eyes were averted, of
naying me my gains out of my own money
lying on the table! This discovery put an
end to a pleasant gathering. Thus will
ine blnck sheep defile an entire flock of
immaculate fleeces.
But now, Sir, I conclude that you and
yours are anxiously waiting for the seer
to unfold his augury with regard to the
Liverpool Autumn Cup. My Pegasus shall
put his best foot forward, and give wings
to the winner.

FROM THE DIARY OF PATERFAMILIAS.
[" The Americans have hit upon a new woman's industry— namely, lullaby-
einging. A certain number of pupils training in the vocal schools and colleget
are to be hired to visit the nurseries and sing to the children at bed-time, and
they have found a general appreciation. "—St. Jamee'e Ga:eltt.]
Monday.—Children very troubleeome again last night.
GEORUR (aged one-and-a-half) and BETTY (six months) firmly
declined to go to sleep, and howled loudly for hours. The nurse
seems quite unable to keep them quiet, and treated with much
scorn ELIZA'S timid suggestion that she should sing them lulla-
bies, remarking that she wasn't going to demean herself in that
way, and that, if we wanted singing done, we 'd better hire one
of those low professional persons to do it. ELIZA remarks that
perhaps it would be well to do this, ae the papers say that the
new lullaby-singers have met with "general appreciation."
Tells me to order one on my way home from the city. (Later.)
Have interviewed the manager at the College of Music, who
promised to send round a high-class performer. Hope we may
get a quiet night at last.
Tuesday.—Young lady with a large portfolio of music under
her arm arrived at six o'clock last night. Took up her position
on the hearthrug in the nursery, and opened fire with "Sleep,
my love, Леер!" followed by "We're a-noddin'." Only result
was to make both infante yell with terror. Then she began
SCHUMANN'S "Schlummerlied," but stopped in the middle, ex-
plaining that unfortunately she could sing no more, as she was
suffering from sore throat. Dismissed her, and then was kept
awake nearly all the night by the children, in whom she seemed
to have aroused a spirit of emulation. Experiment not suocese-
ful so far
Wednmday.—Called at the College of Music; manager pro-
fusely apologetic. Promised to supply another vocalist guaran-
teed not to break down.
6 P.M..—Lullaby-singer number two just arrived. When told
of our former experience, she remarked that with intelli-
gent and cultivated children like ours ( Ki.i/.л much delighted
at this) the old-fashioned music was of no use. This case evi-
dently needed to be treated with WAGNER. She begins to sing
WAONER forthwith.
8 P.M.—The manager has fulfilled his promise in so far as there
is clearly no chance of this woman getting tired. She has a
voice like a steam-whistle. She has now been singing WAGNER
for two hours; both children are still wide awake, and screaming
fiercely. I fly to the club.
Midnight.—Return, to find WAGNER still being sung, and my
wife in hysterics. Servant comes round from next door: "Mr.
JONES'S complimente, Sir, and please when the epitheted substan-
tive is this noise going to stop?" Expostulate with the singer,
and try to drive her away. She refuses to go, saying, that the
credit of her profession is at stake, and continues to sing till
3 A.M., when she is at last induced to depart.
Thursday.—My firm resolve to have nothing more to do with
lullaby-singers is overcome by the manager, who undertakes to
send a more skilful vocalist—free of charge—to-night. Re-
luctantly acquiesce, and she duly appears. Marvellous to say,
her success is complete; after about five minutes of her singing,
both children fall into a profound sleep. We immediately
offer her a month's engagement.
Friday.—Same delightful result; she manages to soothe
the children wonderfully. ELIZA, however, declares that they
are both looking far from well.
Saturday.—Alas! we have been outrageously duped! To-
night ELIZA, not being quite satisfied with our singer's manner,
concealed herself in the nursery while she performed. To her
horror, she caught the so-called vocalist in the act of administer-
ing chloroform to our innocent BETTY and GEORGE! We de-
cide to dispense for the future with the services of the pro-
fessional "lullaby-singer."
"ONE MAN MAY STEAL A HORSE"
[Mrs. CASTLE, a wealthy American lady, sentenced last week to three
months' imprisonment for stealing furs, "was released after a very short
detention. HENRIETTA STEWART, a poor English governess, was sentenced
at the same time, and (in a far less degree) for the same offence, to six
months' imprisonment, and woe not released.]
Journalist interview! Specialist.
I BEG your pardon, but could you tell me the meaning of
"kleptomania"?
It is a modern name for a very ancient complaint.
What is it called in plain English?
It used to be known as "picking and stealing."
Why is that term not now employed?
For fear of wounding the sufferers' susceptibilities.
Does the complaint prevail with various degrees of virulence?
Certainly, it attacks persons very differently. It is chronic
in tha East End, where many of the patients belong to the de-
serving class of housebreakers and pickpockets. In the West
End the victims of the epidemic »re less common, but in the
City they are by no means rare.
What are the symptoms of the disease?
An irresistible desire to appropriate other people's belongings,
whether they be watches or dividends.
What is the course of treatment for the patients?
It is generally found that a three months' cure at Wormwood
Scrubs works wonders, though persons have been known to re-
Is the disorder catching?
Thero is a certain amount of catching about it, but a good
many cases never come to light.
Was it known to the ancients?
Well, Mercury was a bit of a kleptomaniac, while Autolyeus
and ancient Pistol are good Shakspearian instance». In more
recent times the patient was liable to be hanged, especially if
his complaint took the form of hallucination with regard to
property in sheep.
What is your theory with respect to the disease?
I think it is probably due to a bacillus, of a description acute
enough to notice the leniency with which its host is treated.
Give it tht» slightest encouragement, and it waxes fruitful and
multiplies to an alarming extent.
Is there any check to its depredations?
They say that every bacillus has its phagocyte, and I believe
that the resources of science are equal to cultivating the latter
with sufficient effect. Meanwhile, we must be content with the
drastic remedies at present in vogue, by which the rich may
profit as well as the poor.
BE-NATURALI8ATION.
DURING last month fifty Certificates of Naturalisation were
granted to "aliens" by the Home Secretary. Could not a few
be spared for distribution amongst the "Little Engländers" of
to-day?

EXTRACTS FROM THE TRAVEL DlARY OF ToBY, M.P.
Harrogate, Monday.—Just before prorogation the Member
for SARK and I arranged to go to Homburg. After infinitely
stretched courses of long speeches, diversified by a few all-night
sittings, must go somewhere to recruit. On reflection,
ask ¿d each other Why Homburg? Are not Abana and Plmrpar,
rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel P If
we must needs have most necessaries of life "made in Ger-
many," at least lut us avoid the practice of getting ourselves
re-made there.
"Consult lions i KM PACHA," said SARK. "His knowledge of
watering-places, home and foreign, is extensive and peculiar."
Dropped in on ROOSTBM at his Pachalik, off Berkeley Square.
Stated our caae. The great Pacha unfolded his twined legs;
re-folded them; hitched them a little on one side; sucked medi-
tatively at his hubble-bubble, and said, " Try Harrogate. Water
the same as Homburg, only more so. In addition to a well
containing much the same properties as Elizabethan Brunnen
there is one that equals Kissingen. Moreover, Harrogate has
much the same bracing air that distinguishes Homburg beyond
most continental watering-places."
That 's how we came to Harrogate. Find the Pacha, ae usual,
spoke the words of truth and soberness. Quite apart from
remedial effects of baths and waters, Harrogate is charming
place of résidence. SARK, who, like Ulysses and GBORGB CUKZON,
has travelled much, protests it is one of the pleasantest places
he knows. The town is built on a tableland nearly five hun-
dred feet above the sea level. It stands almost midway be-
tween the German Ocean and the Irish Sea. This morning the
scent the German Ocean. As we happened, at the moment to be
passing a sausage shop this may have been a fancy born of asso-
ciation of ideas. Beyond salubrious height of situation, much
is owing to happy accident of the Stray. This is a patch of
grass-grown common plucked out of the heart of the ancient
Forest of Knaresborough, and secured for ever to the people
of Harrogate. No builder, speculative or otherwise, may dese-
crate it with touch of pick or spade. Harrogate is built round
it, secure in possession of this mighty lung.
Another accident that confirms to Harrogate the title of
Happy is the contiguity of fine, clean, and presumably cheap
building-stone. Consequently bricks, which are bearable, stucco
which is unendurable, are rarely seen. Overlooking the Stray
are here and there to be found peaked and gabled houses that
p;ive the place a restful, old-world look. The modern builder,
inspired by these, has added broad streets of shapely, comfort-
able houses. To the casual passer-by they subtly convey
impression of being more than housee. They are also homes.
Churches, congregational and episcopalian, abound, without
exception of admirable construction. As for hotels, their name
is anything you like, from The Prospect to The frince of Wales,
from The Crown to The Marquis of Granby.
SAM WELLER'S father, if he were still with us, and chanced
to drive round the Stray till he passed The Marquis of Granby,
would not recognise in it any kinship with an old familiar friend.
The little hostelry at Dorking, kept by Mrs. SUSAN CI.AKKE,
displaying as signpost the head of the Markis O'Granby, could
comfortably be stowed away in the barn behind the hotel, which
at the beginning of the century served Harrogate for a play-
house.
Just ninety years ago Lord BYRON stopped at the Crown,
and wrote there his poem, "To a Beautiful Quaker." There
still lingers tradition of the terrible fights which took place
between his two dogs, Ndson and Bo'sun. Quite a common
thing, the oldest inhabitant of Harrogate tells SARK, to see
the poet, broomstick in hand, endeavouring to part the com-
batants. In the end peace was brought about by the tragic
withdrawal from the scene of Nelson. Tiring of the monotony
of munching lios'un, Nelson got into the stable, and leaping at
the throat of a horse, hung on till a pistol shot through the
brain loosened his hold.
"Harrogate stingo," SARK, for shortness, calls the "Old
Sulphur" water upon whose ever-bubbling stream Harrogate
prosperously floats. Regarded as a table water it is not ex-
actly attractive. It has the faint savour of a beaten-up egg, the
egg having been selected chiefly on account of age. The Kissingen
water, aerated or still, is almost palatable. Both are in their
way excellent, as the yearly accumulating table of those profit-
ing by them testify.
"The Yorkshire Spaw," as the place is called in ancient litera-
ture, enjoyed wide fame as far back as CROMWELL'S time.
Witbin the last ten years it has experienced a new and more
vigorous lease of life. The local authorities have begun to
wake up to the wide possibilities that lie at their hands.
They 've got the wells, they Ve got the baths, they want the
Kursaal too. There is no reason, beyond lack of well-directed
enterprise, why Harrogate should not be as popular as Hom-
burg. But the local authorities must do as the shrewd
burghers oi Homburg have done, and to the attractions of
nature add the luxuries and conveniences of Art.
Happily there is a spur on their intent in the presence on the
spot of a clear-sighted, long-headed doctor, who has made a
study of continental watering-places, and perceives how they
might be adapted to the needs and opportunities of the York-
shire Spa. In his mind's eye he beholds Harrogate ende wed
with a pump-room common to the service of all the mineral
waters; covered promenades where patients may foregather
between their cups; a concert-hall; a news-room, even an Art
gallery. Above all, a band that need not shrink from com-
parison with that which discourses sweet music at Homburg.
Towards the realisation of this dream there is already con-
tributed a handsome block of new baths, worthy of the archi-
tectural perfectnese of the town, enriched with all the latest
luxuries. This is to be opened in time for next year's season,
when, peradventure, SARK and I will come again.

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
(Being some Letter»from. lir. fioundabout to his Xcphew at Cambridge,
and to Others.)
No. II.—OF SPELLING—OF MOTHERS—OF SCHOOLBOYS AND THEIR
FATHERS—OF FRIENDSHIP AND THE HAKINO OF FRIENDS.
MY DBAB JACK,—It was very pleasant to get your letter,
and I am obliged to you for writing to me eo fully. I may
note, by the way, that the accepted spelling of the word
"obliged " is as I have set it down. "Oblidçed," which you seem
to prefer, is a pleasing variant, but there is no good authority
for it.
I saw your mother three days ago. She was in London on
what she called a professional visit, that is, she was taking the
reluctant ALICE to be inspected by the dentist. ALICE appears
to have behaved with the Spartan courage that might naturally
be expected in one of her sex and name, and to have offered,
voluntarily, to go again next day at the same price, namely,
half-a-crown in cash, and an afternoon at "England's Home or
Mystery," but the perfection of her teeth and her mother's
arrangements both precluded such an arrangement. Your mother,
of course, was full of you, and though I had written to her and
described your start in a University career, I had to go through
the whole story again—which I did, not unwillingly. I hope
you '11 write often to your mother, my dear hoy. She thinks
you the most beautiful, the cleverest, the strongest, and the
most engaging of created beings. She 's wrong, of course—
even you will admit that—but the least you can do for her to
repay her for this amiable delusion, and for all she has done
and suffered for you, is to love her with all your heart, and to
write to her now and then so that she may feel she has some
share in your new life. Imagine the pleasure that it gives her
when, for instance, the vicar calls and asks what news she has
of JACK, and how he likes Cambridge, and what lectures he is
attending, and if he has taken to boating—imagine, I say, her
pleasure at being able to say that she has had more than one
letter from you, that you have taken to the river, but you seem
to think it unlikely that you will get a seat in the Cambridge
Eight next term, there being so many of last year's crew left,
and that you are attending lectures regularly with a view to
honours as a classical wrangler, though, for her part, she hopee
you will not overdo your reading, as young men are so thought-
less about their health, and she knows of one poor boy who
broke down and became a hopeless idiot owing to overwork.
The vicar will smile—vicars have been to Cambridge or Oxford
themselves, and know a tiling or two—but there will be nothing
bitter in the smile, for he will probably remember the eager
enthusiasm and devotion of his own mother in days long past,
her innocent exaggeration of his merits and her blindness to his
faults. There are at this moment in existence some five
hundred mothers of Cambridge freshmen (not to epeak of about
the same number of Oxford mothers), each one of whom firmly
believes that she has sent to the University a paragon of good
looks, or intellect or amiability, or of all three in combination.
When your mother pays you her promised visit at Cambridge,
you will be proud of her and make much of her, and show her
all the sights. It will be a great day for her—and for you.
At school, things were different, I think. Certainly there
was pleasure in the prospect of parents' visite, but there was
also a sense of anxiety. Would their appearance, we asked our-
selves, be creditable to us, or would they put us to shame by
wearing something or saying something or behaving in a way
that the public feeling of our fellow-schoolboys might disap-
prove? Boys, English boys at least, are the merest slaves of
the narrowest conventions with regard to fashion, and resent
bitterly any transgression of their little code. Your grand-
father, as you may remember, had a very large head, and the
natural size of his hats was exaggerated by their straight,
broad brims. When at nn early stage of my school career the
old gentleman came to see me, I hoped against hope that DUFF
secundus might not see him, for I knew that DUFF secundiu
would disapprove of that hat, and would express his disappro-
val in his usual caustic way. Fate, however, willed it other-
wise. My father came, and DUFF saw him full in the cricket-
field, where no merciful shadows disguised a single inch of the
height and circumference of that fatal hat. "What was that
your governor was wearing?" said this hateful boy to me after
the old man was gone.
"A coat," I replied, with a feeble effort to avert the in-
evitable.
"I don't mean that, fat-face. What had he got on his head?"
"Oh—a—well, a hat. I suppose."

THOUGHT TRANSFERENCE.
Hostess. "GOOD NIGHT, GENERAL! So KIND OF ME то HAVE
ASKF.D YOU."
Öltest. "NOT AT ALL. So KIND OF ME TO HAVE COME!"
I call it a jolly big portmanteau." The insult was a gross one,
and I felt it, but DUFF secundus being an older and rather a
bigger boy I bided my time and swallowed the affront. Two
terms later, however, a collision at football convinced me that
I could cope with him. On the following morning I chose my
opportunity, approached him from behind and smashed his hat
over his eyes. "Call that a hat," I said, "I call it "I
never finished the retaliatory sentence, for he turned like light-
ning and banged me in the mouth. We fought in the old hat-
lobby. Humus was my second, CHOLLOP held an imaginary
bottle for DUFF. The contest was short but decisive. At the
start DUFF pinned me up against the hat^pegs, and thus did a
double execution upon my body from in front and from behind.
The position was unendurable; by a great effort I freed myself
from it, and, closing with the prematurely exultant DUFF, drove
my right fist full on his yielding nose, and then bore him
crashing to the ground, where he lay, a gory spectacle. I
asked him if he wanted any more; he said he didn't. I told
him there wae plenty more where that came from if I got any
more of his cheek, and so departed triumphantly with the trium-
phant Hi.onus. I saw DUFF only last week. He is bald, he
wears spectacles; he is a busy city merchant. We hobnobbed
together, and parted good friends. His eldest boy, he told me,
is to go to Cambridge next October. You must call on him and
be kind to him, if you can. By that time you will be in a
position to show some kindness in your little world, though you
may think, too, that your circle of friends will be complete,
and that you will not require any more. If you do think that
you will make a mistake.
But I must break off here, and resume the consideration of
this important matter in another letter.

As light aa fairies, if not altogether as brisk as bees, did the
four Pickwickian shades assemble on a winter morning in the
year of grace, 1896. Christmas was nigh at hand, in all its
/in-de-siede inwardness; it was the season of pictorial too-pre-

shocker-sensationalism sandwiched with startling advertise-
ments; of cynical new-humour and flamboyantly sentimental
chromo-Iithography.
But we are so taken up by the genial delights of the New
Christmas that we are keeping Mr. PICKWICK and his phantom
friends waiting in the cold on the chilly outside of the Muggle-
ton Motor-car, which they had just mounted, well wrapped up
in antiquated great coats, shawls, and comforters.
Mr. WBLLBR, Senior, had, all unconsciously, brought his well-
loved whip with him, and was greatly embarrassed thereby.
"Votever shall I do vith it, SAMMY ?" he whispered hoarsely.
"Purtend it's a new, patent, jointlese fishing-rod, guv'nor,"
rejoined SAM, in a Stygian aside. "Nobody 'ere'11 'ave the
slightest notion vot it really ie."
"When are they—eh—going to—ahem—put the horses to?"
murmured Mr. PICKWICK, emerging from his coat collar, and
looking about him with great perplexity.
'"Osses?" cried the coachman, turning round upon Mr. PICK-
WICK, with sharp suspicion in his eye. "'Osses f d'ye say. Oh,
who are you a-gettin' at?"
Mr. PICKWICK withdrew promptly into his coat-collar.
The irrepressible SAM came immediately to the aid of bis be-
loved master, whom he would never see snubbed if he knew it.

The driver—if it be not desecration to a noble old name so
to designate him—gave a turn to his wheel and the autocar
started. Mr. WINKLE, who sat at the extreme edge, waggled
his shadowy legs forlornly in the air; Mr. SNODGRASS, who sat
next to him, snorted lugubriously, Mr. TUPMAN turned paler

took off his glasses and wiped them furtively.

Mr. WKLLKE the elder. "I can't stand it, SAMIVKI,. I really

considered it advisable to interview an omnibus horse of my
acquaintance to learn his views on the subject. I found the
object of my search quietly munching his supper in a stable. He
received me with more apathy than enthusiasm.
"I suppose, Mr. GEEGEE," I began, "that you do not object
to the use of these new carriages on principle?"
"Well," he replied, after a slight pau*e, which enabled him to
consume a mouthful of corn, "I don't suppose I do. Of course,
if we get more rest we shall not complain."
"But how about the shareholders?"
"I have nothing to do with them. My duty is to make so
many journeys a day, for which services I receive food and
lodging."
"But if you were driven off the road, will not that proceeding
cost you some annoyance?"
"Why, yes," returned Mr. GEEGEE, with a horse laugh; "it
is certainly not pleasant to be disturbed without compensation.
But if we are not wanted in London we shall find plenty of
occupation at Margate and other watering-placee. I do not
believe that the new method will interfere to any serious extent
with the bathing-machines."
"Quite so; but then you have mentioned a trade which is
confined to the summer months. What will you do in the
winter?"
"I have considered that question carefully, and, taking into
account the love of Englishmen for horsemanship, believe that
there will always be room for из in the circus."
"But does not the arena require special training?"
"To some extent," was the cautious response; "but I am

it was to express a decided negative.
"Pardon me for my curiosity," I said, as I was about to take
my leave, "but should you meet one of the new carriages in the

SOOTHSAYER'S VADE MECUM.
Question,. Are prophetic almanacks
popular with the public?
Answer. So it would appear from their
prevalence.
Q. And has not this success been secured
by the veracity of the predictions.
A. That is the contention of their pro-
prietors.
Q. What is the chief aim of a publishing
soothsayer?
А. Тз narrow a prophecy as much as
possible, while extending its limits to the
utmost.
Q. Explain your meaning by an ex-
ample.
A. Say that you narrow your prophecy
to the bare statement that in "January a
Royal House will be afflicted," you can de-
clare it applicable to the death of the

ninth-rate princelet unearthed from an ob-
scure page in the Almanack de Gotha.
Q. And would not a Royal House be
afflicted by bnytbing less than a death of
one of its members?
A. Certainly, the loss of a favourite cat
or cherished walking-stick would be equally
applicable.
Q. Supposing that you foretell that a
State will lose a valued public servant, how
will the prophecy be satisfied?
A. By the death of almost anyone. A
great statesman who had made history in
Europe for half a century or a lamplighter
to a South American Republic who had
been appointed a fortnight since to his
office would each do equally well.
Q. How would you discover that "a
terrible calamity gravely injurious to the
human race " had come off?
A. By noticing that some such occur-
rence аз the earthquake of Lisbon, or an
accident to an excursion train in Canada,
attended by the decease of a baby in arms,
had taken place.
Q. Then you believe that, whatever
might happen, you would so hedge round
your predictions that you would be ulti-
mately able to surmount your difficulties?
A. Certanly; for a soothsayer who
knows his business will always leave him-
self a loophole for escape, and prove for
the thousandth time that prophecy rightly
handled naturally and appropriately leads
to profit.

[NOVEMBER 21, 1896.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
DARBY JONES IN THE MIDLANDS AND
NORTH.
HONOURED SIR?—The signs of the de-
cadence of flat racing, not flat catching, for
the winter greet the astute punter (I do
not refer, however, to the conductor of a
flat-bottomsd boat) on every side. The
trainers now talk like so many Charons of
the possibility of getting some of their
sorriest crocks "over the sticks." Well,
indeed, is this called the "illegitimate sea-
son," for who would father such a miserable
meeting (I refer to the stakes, not the
fields') ая that just perpetrated in cold blood
at Birmingham? Prizes of £72, £38, £46,
£45, and £33 were the noble recompenses
offered for the most part by the promoters
of the gathering! I agree with that Emi-
nent Peer of the Realm, Ex-viceroy, Coal-
owner, and Chairman of the London School
Board, the Marquis of LONDONDERRY, that
if racing is to Ьэ maintained as the leading
sport of Englishmen (under this designa-
tion I include Scots, Irish, Welsh, Manx-
men, and Channel Islanders), handsome re-
wards should be offered for competition,
not miserable purses with which a leading
pickpocket would be disappointed after an
afternoon's ramble down Regent Street.
On the last day at Birmingham forty-six
quadrupeds contended for a gross sum of
£383, or rather over eight golden sove-
reigns apiece! And to carry off suet
Brobdmgnaician Stakes railway fares,
jockeys, entries and keep had to be sup-
plied bv the adventurous owners! Withal,
the fields were large. I have read, Sir, of
the exploits of EhV-nbethan mariners,
hended by Sir WALTER RALEIGH of tobacco
and potato fnme, who went forth to dis-
cover the Golden City of Manoa, but I '11
wager my bull's-hide Gladstone bag to an
American-leather grip-sack that Sir WAL-
TER and his comrades would never have
ventured tho risk entailed by these paltry
gatherings on terra fi.rma.
Bromford Bridée is not, I allow, the
centro of th« civilised world, as, indeed
the quagmire by which it is approached
duly testifies, but when B. B. is taken by
the ignorant Southerner to mean Big Bir-
mingham, even a few samples of electro-
mate would strengthen the value of the
iwnorariu'rs. But I suppose that one of
thesei days we shall come to the Golden Age
of the Anti-Gambling League—no stakes,
no betting, and free and open courses, all
dene for the love of the sport. Then such
capitalists as the Duke of WESTMINSTER, the
Duke of PORTLAND, Sir JOHN BLUNDELI.
MAPLE, the Earl of CREWE, the Earl of
ROSEBERY, and Mr. BARNEY BARNATO, will
be imploring the T/ORD MAYOR to start a
Mansion House Fund for the benefit of
Indigent Jockeys ruined by the prevalence
of Motor-cars.
But still, Sir, there are, as even the des-
titute Pelican or the much-abused Scape-
goat will allow. Oases in the Wilderness.
I trust that I am correct in my Latin
grammar. Among theso Sanctuaries of
Sport let me reckon Liverpool. The Liver
is, I believe, a fabulous bird ranking with
the Phoenix, the Roc, and the Whistle-
Wostle. Ho exists no longer, having, so the
legend runs, been totally destroyed by long-
continued fusillades of blue pill. But still
the memory of this weird fowl is honoured.
She must, I imagine, have been the fore-
mother of the coy and diffident Oof-bird of
modern timea, so eagerly pursued by every-
one, from the gentle Chancellor of the
gan-grinder. In any case, her deserted
nest has produced and is producing many
broods of well-plumed livers up-to-date,
who do not hesitate to plunge fearlessly
into the Stream of Life. When a Liver-
pudlian—shudder not, honoured Sir, the
epithet is theirs, not mine—resolves on do-
ing a thing, he does it well, inspired, no
doubt, to obtain as much enjoyment as
riches can command by the ever-horrible
sight of the slimy and distressing Mersey,
an estuary which yields not to the mouth
of the Garonne in the bitter melancholy of
its surroundings. The unhappy voyagers
from the land of the Stars and Stripes,
who first see Liverpool, must indeed ima-
gine that they have come to a country
from which the Pilgrim Fathers did well
to fly.
But, as a town, Liverpool, like an oyster
with an unprepossessing shell, conceals

most succulent relief. At the Adelphi
Hotel you may, as I suggested last week,
make merry with the Turtle that sings to
vou in the rhythm of "clear" or "thick."
At the theatres you are entranced by the
London-like appearance of the stage ; at the
music halls you can delight the eye and ear
while solacing the gullet with its necessary
7«an<um of refreshment. And on classic
Aintree you have a race-course second to
none within the humble ken of your obe-
d:ent servant. It has had many patrons,
but none more consistent than the Lord of
KXOWSLEY, the present Earl of DERBY
(would that I could add, "and JONES"), a
sportsman, who had so great a love for a
horse that he himself became a mayor.
For four days in the most distressful
month of the year the Liverpudlians
(again forgive the expression) kept, as they
used to say at the Gaiety Theatre, when it
was a theatre, "the ball a-rolling." 1
would like to be rolling that ball now, for
did not Sardis, in the great Lancashire
Handicap, richly compensate me for pre-
vious disappointments? Shall I tell you
why—in the strictest confidence? Because
before going to the course a Lovely Lady
told me that Mr. VYNER'S colt was sure to
win, inasmuch as she had lunched on sar-
dines à la Snyr.r and champagne. There
was a tip! I chalked it up, and conse-
quently returned to mine hostelry possess-
ing a pouch replete with those documents
which the Grand Old Lady of Threadneedle
Street has never been known to dishonour
within the recollection of
Your satisfied serf,
DABBY JONES.
P.S.—I trust that you, honoured Sir,
and my clients in general did not fail to
profit by the victory of M. LEBAUDY'S titled
representative in the Liverpool Cup. If
words of poesy foretold "The Count may
come again," and I also held out warning
with regard to the "Irish pair," referring,
of course, to Si. Jarlath and his queerly-
nained compatriot. I vehemently warned
off every one from touching such an in-
flated animal as Birchrod, though she fin-
ished first favourite with my colleague
"Mr. Hotspur," and the public in general.
I do not conceal from you that I fully ex-
pected Stnwmarket to recoup Mr. B. BAR-
NATO for the expense to which he has been
put with regard to OOM PAUL'S lions, but
I cannot rebuke Fortune on this occasion,
my motto always being that of a Parlia-
mentary carpet-bagger, "Win and a
place."
[D»KitY JONKS seems to be, ns usual when he

SPORTIVE SONGS.
A fi'unner waiting for early wild-fowl rests on a
Bathing-machine in a well-remembered spot.
I REST beside the moonlit sea,
Its plash the only sound!
The sands long maindecks seem to be
That have no bulwarks round;
Tho coastguard's signal on the hill
Stands black against the sky,
The air is very raw and chill;
I think of you, and why?
Last August, in this very cove,
Your presence graced the scene;
Here in these waves to swim you strove,
And this was your machine!
[ know the number twenty-three.
Hence in the water blue
You leapt, a mermaid fair and free—
I never looked at you!
But now I seem to hear you trip
Upon this tar-stained board,
And fancy I can see you dip
While " bobbing " with the cord.
Your red-gold locks in oilskin cap,
Your garb of crimson hue—
[ always was a modest chap,
And never looked at you 1
'Tis like a dream! For then I thought
You swam with grace and ease,
Just like the bathing wench, who taught
Her skill for well-earned fees.
But now I know you always put
Your plump white arms in riew,
But on the shingle kept a foot.
I never looked at you 1 .
Like Aphrodite shaking pearls
You rose from out the main,
And coyly hid some errant curls,
And then you "bobbed" again!
Then with a laugh and sinuous leap
You bade the waves adieu.
I dream, and yet I 'm not asleep—
I never looked at you!
In toilette trim with floating locks,
No cap their wealth restrained,
You joined me where those sullen rocks
Were welcome haven gained.
You prattled of the joys of Love,
The Beautiful, the True.
And from your side I could not move—
For then I looked at you!
'Twas just three months ago and yet
Your troth was like this sand
On which is written large "Forget 1
Mistake me not for land!"
Now do I not—the past is done,
Though day must follow night—
A whirr o'erhead! Here! quick! my gun!
Exchequer down to the exasperating or-
The ducks are on tho flight!

KII.I.F.I1 HIS LAST DoO TO SAVE THE OTHER»!"
LETTERS OF MABJOR1E AND GLADYS.
I.—Тнк DECLINE OF FLIRTATION'.
MY DEAR GLADYS,—I had not heard from you for so long—not,
indeed, since the sad termination of your last engagement—•
that 1 was quite struck by the casual, inconsequent tone of your
letter, and still more by the calm flippancy with which you ex-
press the surprising opinion that "flirtation is gradually
dying out."
I know there is much to be said for this view, and without
going as far as a young friend of mine, who recently declared
the only lady-killer of modern times was the unpopular character
known to contemporary history as "Jack the Ripper," I admit
I do perceive a slight falling-off in the number of those young
men who were formerly classed as "mashers "; a decline in the
quality and quantity of the tame cat. The Don Juan is rather
shy than wild, and the jeune premier in general is extremely
rare (and dreadfully spoilt in consequence). It is quite un-
usual, nowadays, to find a young man who lives for ladies' favour.
^ here is the rush at dances to secure the envied hand of the
b?lle of the ball? Is there such a thing, now, as the belle of
a ball? I think not. In France, they attribute this decline
to the increasing charms of the bicycle. But what do the French
know about flirtation? Flirtation is an essentially English
product (in America, it is too frequently liable to degenerate
into mere friendship); and, though the French imitate us now,
there seems to me always something a little depressing, even a
little sinister, in a Parisian's mode of carrying on what he calls
"un flirt" with an English girl. I doubt if an English girl ever
quite realises his point of view.
But to speak of it as a quaint old custom, surviving merely
on Margate Pier and in the Kensington Town Hal!, is to ex-
aggerate dreadfully. Especially it is not for you to make such
an assertion, you, who spend your spare time in collecting all
the most frivolous living exponents of the art. You forget that
I watched, through the opera-glasses of friendly interest, your
somewhat breathless gallop through your last season. You left
me gasping at the immense strides you have made since you
came out, at your caprices, your fickleness. There was a time
when you liked one young man better than the others for a
month, or even more; now, one musical afternoon is the average
duration, and a couple of dinner-parties the limit. And then,
your reasons for your preferences. They are as futile as your
excuses for giving them up. You liked DE VERNEY "Ьесаияе
you heard he took cocaine," and threw him over because he was
"too thin and too fond of jeu-ellery." You became inseparable
friends with young MONTFOBD for nearly a whole evening, be-
cause you had been told "he had naturally curly hair that was
artificially straightened out." When you found out that the iron
had never entered into his hair you dropped him at once, on the
trivial pretext that he sent you some roses, and that you are
"tired of roses." Tired of roses! at twenty! Sometimes the
reason for your sympathy is the same one as the reason for your
coldness. You took a fancy to CARINOTON "because he wore a
black ribbon watch-chain," and you gave up CARINOTON "be-
cause he wore a lilnck ribbon watch-chain." Indeed, ever since
your engagement with that serious young man, ORIEL, who
left England und т a cloud, for which his father had to provide
the silver lining, I observe that your admirers become more and
more of a trivial type. Two points in common are to be found
in them all. whatever their variety—either they are called
REGGIE, or they nre Secretaries. In extreme cases, thev are
both. They all do nothing, and think they know everything;
they are constantly being photographed, freouently in some
sentimental difficulty, and complain a eood deal to one another
of the "wearingness" of being faithful to five people at once.
Marriage never even occurs to them, and since, I suppose, you
have not given un the idea—not thinking a Humber a sufficient
substitute for a husband—I should stronglv advise you to turn
your thoughts, soon, in a different direction. But when you
write again, please don't complain of the decline of flirtation;
the lament, from you, Ьяя so hollow a sound. Rether, give me
instead some instances of the new methods, your own and your
friends'. I have not kept up with the movement of late, and I
have be^n told that you have reached a high level of artistic
merit. But do be more serious!
Your affectionate friend, MARJORIB.
CANINE SAGACITY.
NOBLE CONDUCT OF A PLTPY!
DE.VU SIB,—My little son (AUGUSTUS, aged four-and-a-half)
was loft in a room by himself, about three days ago. He found
two or three stray lucifer matches, and proceeded to strike them
for his own amusement. I happened to reach one of the door-
ways leading into the apartment just as he had succeeded in
burning his first match. Imagine my dismay—and thankfulness!
Before, however, I could say a word, or step forward, another
actor appeared upon the scene—a young St. Bernard (named
SqudcJi) which had not hitherto shown marked intelligence.
He saw the danger, and decided upon action as promptly as any
human being could have done under the circumstances. With
a blow of his paw he knocked the remaining matches from the
hands of my little son. The latter has a spirit of his own, and
not understanding the wisdom and kindliness which dictated the
dog's action, endeavoured pettishly to recover his playthings.
Now comes the supreme interest of the story! Seeing that he
was likely to be foiled in his benevolent purpose, the devoted
animal deliberately chewed up and swallowed the remaining
matches! thereby preventing all further risk to the child at con-
siderable inconvenience to himself!
I read with much interest a letter which appeared exactly a
year ago in your columns about a dog who unselfishly presented
his mistress with his best bone; but I think you will agree with
me that Squelch has broken the record. He has shown decided
signs of seediness for the last day or two, undoubtedly due to
the harmful nature of the chemicals absorbed into his system.
Yet the noble dog must have been aware at the time that such
unnatur.il diet was bound to disagree with him—yet he never
faltered. Believe me, Sir, Yours ever,
A THANKFUL PARENT.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
DARBY JONES IN THE MIDLANDS AND
NORTH.
HONOURED SIR,—The signs of the de-
cadence of flat racing, not flat catching, for
tho winter street the astute punter (I do
not refer, however, to the conductor of а
flat-bottomsd boat) on every side. The
trainers now talk like so many Charons of
the possibility of getting some of their
sorrieet crocks "over the sticks." Well,
indeed, is this called the " illegitimate sea-
son," for who would father such a miserable
meeting (I refer to the stakes, not the
fields^ as that just perpetrated in cold blood
at Birmingham? Prize« of £72, £38, £46,
£45, and £33 were the noble recompenses
offered fur the most part by the promoters
of the gathering! I agre? with that Emi-
nent Peer of the Realm, Ex-viceroy, Coal-
owner, and Chairman of the London School
Board, the Marquis of LONDONDERRY, that
if racing is to be maintained as the leadinp
sport of Englishmen (under this designa-
tion I include Scots, Irish, Welsh, Manx-
men, and Channel Islanders), handsome re-
wards should be offered for competition,
not miserable purses with which a leading
pickpocket would be disappointed after an
afternoon's ramble down Regent Street.
On the last day at Birmingham forty-six
Quadrupeds contended for a gross sum of
£383, or rather over eight golden sove-
reigns apiece! And to carry off such
Brobdingnagian Stakes railway fares,
jockeys, entries and keep had to be sup-
plied bv the adventurous owners! Withal,
tho fields were large. I have read, Sir, of
the exploits of Elizabethan mariners,
headed by Sir WALTER RALEIGH of tobacco
and potato fame, who went forth to dis-
cover the Golden City of Manoa, but I'll
wager my bull's-hide Gladstone bag to an
American-leather grip-sack that Sir WAL-
TER and his comrades would never have
ventured tho risk entailed by these paltry
gatherings on ferra firma.
Bromford Bridée is not, I allow, thr
centro of the civilised world, as, indeed
the quagmire by which it is approached
duly testifies, but when В. В. ¡я taken by
the ignorant Southerner to mean Big Bir-
mingham, even a few samples of electro-
plate would strengthen the value of the
honorarium*. But I suppose that one of
these! days we shall come to the Golden Age
of the Anti-Gambling League—no stakes.
no betting, and free and open courses, all
dene for the love of the sport. Then such
capitalists us the Duke of WESTMINSTER, the
Duke of PORTLAND. Sir JOHN BLUNDELI.
MAPLE, the Earl of CREWE, the Earl of
ROSEBERY, and Mr. BARNEY BARNATO, will
be imploring the LORD MAYOR to start n
Mansion House Fund for the benefit of
Indigent Jockeys ruined by the prevalence
of Motor-cars.
But still, Sir, there are, as even the des-
titute Pelican or the much-abused Scape-
goat will allow, Oases in the Wilderness.
I trust that I am correct in my Latin
grammar. Among these Sanctuaries of
Sport let me reckon Liverpool. The Liver
is, I believe, a fabulous bird ranking with
the Phœnix, the Hoc, and the Whistle-
Wostle. Ho exists no longer, having, so the
legend runs, been totally destroyed by long-
continued fusillades of blue pill. But still
tho memory of this weird fowl is honoured.
She must, I imagine, have been the fore-
mother of the coy and diffident Oof-bird of
modern times, so eagerly pursued by every-
one, from the gentle Chancellor of the
gan-grinder. In any case, her deserted
nest has produced and is producing many
broods of well-plumed livers up-to-date,
who do not hesitate to plunge fearlessly
into the Stream of Life. When a Liver-
pudlian—shudder not, honoured Sir, the
epithet is theirs, not mine—resolves on do-
ing a thing, he does it well, inspired, no
doubt, to obtain as much enjoyment as
riches can command by the ever-horrible
sight of the slimy and distressing Mersey,
an estuary which yields not to the mouth
of the Garonne in the bitter melancholy of
its surroundings. The unhappy voyagers
from the land of the Stars and Stripes,
who first see Liverpool, must indeed ima-
gine that they have come to a country
from which the Pilgrim Fathers did well
to fly.
But, as a town, Liverpool, like an oyster
with an unprepossessing shell, conceals

most succulent relief. At the Adelphi
Hotel you may, as I suggested last week,
mike merry with the Turtle that sings to
vou in the rhythm of "clear" or "thick."
At the theatres you are entranced by the
London-like appearance of the stage ; at the
music halls you can delight the eye and ear
while solacing the gullet with its necessary
7«antitm of refreshment. And on classic
Aintree you have a race-course second to
none within the humble ken of your obe-
-l:ent servant. It has had many patrons,
but none more consistent than the Lord of
KNOWSLEY, the present Earl of DERBY
(would that I could add, "and JONES"), a
•sportsman, who had so great a love for a
horse that he himself became a mayor.
For four days in the most distressful
nicnth of the year the Liverpudlians
(again forgive the expression) kept, as they
used to say at the Gaiety Theatre, when it
was a theatre, "the ball a-rolling." 1
would like to be rolling that ball now, for
did not Sardis, in the great Lancashire
Handicap, richly compensate me for pre-
vious disappointments? Shall I tell you
why—in the strictest confidence? Because
before going to the course a Lovely Lady
told me that Mr. VYNBR'S colt was sure to
win, inasmuch as she had lunched on sar-
dines à la Hnyer and champagne. There
was a tip! I chalked it up, and conse-
quently returned to mine hostelry possess-
ing a pouch replete with those documente
which the Grand Old Lady of Threndneedle

Your satisfied serf,

JOTTINGS AND TITTLINGS.
(By BABOO HURKY BUKOSIIO JABBERJKZ, B.A.)
No. XXVIII.
Mankletow v. Jabbtrjee, Notes taken by Mr. Jabberjce in Court during
the proceedings.
Queen's Bench Court, No. . 10.20 A.M.
THE eventful morn of my trial for Breach of Promise has at
length arrived, and I am resolved to jot down on the exterior of
my brief such tittles as take place. T have taken my seat in
Court on one of the benches reserved for long-robed juniors,
in my immediate rear being my solicitor, SIDNEY SMARTLE,
Esq., who will officiate as my Remembrancer and Friend in
Need.
In the Great Hall below I had the pleasure to encounter Miss
JRSSIMINA and that worthy Madam her Mamma, being prepared

"Freeh as a daisy, und fiue as a carrot fresh scraped."
to greet them with effusive kindness, and assure them I was only
a hostile in my professional capacity. Whether they were struck
with awe by the unaccustomed majesty of my appearance in
brand-new wig, bands, &c., in which I am fresh ae a daisy, and
fine as a carrot fresh scraped, or whether they simply did not
recognise me in the disguisement of such toggeries, I am not to
decide—but they passed by without responding visibly to my
salutations.
10.26.—A stout, large Q.C., with luxuriant cheek-whiskers
has just entered the row in front. Mister SMARTLE whispers
me that this is WITHERINO.TON, whom I refused to engage, and
who is now in opposition.
I have taken the undue liberty to pluck him by the sleeve
and introduce myself in straightforward English style to his
honourable notice, acquainting him that his unfortunate client
had a very flimsy case, and was not deserving of success, while
myself was a meritorious Native Neophyte, whose entire fortune
was impaled on a stake, and urging him not to show too windy
a temper to suoh a shorn Iamb as his petitioner.
ears, nor can I induce his learned junior, who is my next neigh-
bour, to show me any fraternal kindness. My said solicitor is
highly indignant at my treatment, and warns me in an undertone
that I am not to make any further overtures to such etuck-up
individuals.
10.30.—Hon'ble Mister Justice HONEYOALL enters in highly
dignified fashion. He is of a bland, benignant, and intensely
clean aspect, which uplifts my downfallen heart, for it is obvious,
from his benevolent and smiling bow to myself that he already
feels a patentai interest in my achieving the conquest of my
spurs.
The jury are taking the oath. Whether any of my co-con-
tributors to Punch are among them I cannot discover, since they
do not vouchsafe to encourage me by the freemasonry of even
a surreptitious simper. But this is perhaps occasioned by over
prudence.
The learned junior on my right has risen, and in shockingly
bald and barren verbiage has stated the issues which are to be
tried, and, being evidently no Heaven-born orator, site abruptly
down, completely gravelled for lack of a more copious vocabu-
lary. A poor tongue-tied devil of a chap whom I regard with
pity!
WITHERINGTON, Q.C., is addressing the jury. He is not a
tongue-tied, but he speaks in a colloquial, commonplace sort of
fashion which does not shed a very brilliant lustre upon boasted
British advocacy.
Though of an unromantic obesity, it appears frora the excessive
eulogies he lavishes upon JESSIMINA that he is already the tangled
fly in the web of her feminine enchantments. What a pity that
such a prominent barrister should be so unskilled in seeing
through the female heart I
He is persisting in making most incorrect and uncomplimentary
allusions to my underserving self, which it is impossible that I
am to suffer without rising to repudiate with voluble indignation!
However, though he makes bitter complainte of my interrup-
tions, he does me the honour to refer to me ae his friend, for
which I thank him with a gratified fervour, assuring him that I
reciprocate his esteem.
Hon'ble Judge has just tendered me the kindly and golden
advice that, unless I sit down and remain hermetically sealed,
the case will infallibly continue for ever and anon, and that I am
not to advance my interests by disregarding the customary eti-
quettes of the Bar.
11.5.—JESSIMINA is giving her testimony. Indubitably she
has greatly improved in her physical appearance since I was
a resident of Porticobello House, and her habiliments are as
fashionably ladylike (if not more so) than Miss WEE-WEE'S own!
Alack I that she should relate her story with so many departures
from ordinary veracity. Her pulchritude and well-assumed
timidity have captivated even the senile Judge, for, after I have
risen and vehemently contradicted her in various unimportant
details, he has actually barked at me that, unless I wait until
it is my turn to cross-examine he will take some very severe
measure with me at the rising of the Court! A pretty specimen
of judicial impartiality!
1.30 P.M.—The Court has risen for lunch at the conclusion of a
rather severe cross-examination by myself of the fair plaintiff,
and, not being oppressed by pangs of hunger, I have leisure to
record the result—which, owing to the partisanship of Hon'ble
Bench, the disgracefully complicated state of the laws of Evidence,
and Miss JEHSIMINA'S ingenuity in returning entirely wrong
answers to my searching interrogatories, did not attain to the
sanguine level of my expectations.
For instance, when I asked her whether it was not the fact
that I was notoriously deficient in physical courageousness, she
made the unexpected reply that she had not observed it, and that
I had frequently described to her my daring achievements in
sticking wild pigs and shooting man-eating tigers.
Also she entirely refused to admit that the turquoise and gold
ring I had given her was not in token of our betrothal, but
merely to compensate her for not being invited as well as myself
to a certain fashionable dinner-party; and the Judge (inter-
rupting in the most unwarrantable manner) said that, as he did
not understand that I seriously denied the existence of an en-
gagement to marry, he was unable to perceive the bearings of my
query.
Again, I reminded her of her mention of the gift of a china
model of Poet SHAKSPBARE'S birthplace, and required her—on
her oath—to answer whether it had not been originally intended
for another lady, and whether, having accidentally seated myself
upon it, I had not decided to bestow the disjecta membra upon
However, he has declined rather peremptorily to lend me his
herself instead.

~

To which she replied, with artfully simulated emotion, that
all she knew was that I had assured her at the time that the said
piece of china had been expressly purchased for herself as a
souvenir of my ardent affeetion, and she had accepted it as such,
and carefully restored it with some patent cement.
Before this the Judge had asked me how I could expect the
plaintiff to know what was passing in the tortuous recesses of
my own mind, and informed her that she need not answer such
a ridiculous question unless she pleased. But she did please,
and her answer was received with applause, which, however, the
Bench perceiving, though tardily, that 1 was entitled to some
protection, did declare in angry tones that it was on no account
to he permitted.
Next I inquired whether it was not true that she was of a
flirtatious disposition, and addicted to laugh and talk vivaciously
with the gentlemen boarders, and whether I had not earnestly
remonstrated with her upon such conduct. Here WITHERING-
TON, Q.C., bounded on to his feet, and protested that I was not
entitled to put this question now, since I had not dared to
allege in my letters or pleadings that I had breached my promise
owing to any misconduct of plaintiff. Bub, instead of submitting
to such objection, JESSIMINA answered in mellifluous accents that
she had never manifested more than ordinary civility towards
any gentleman-boarder, but that I had displayed passionate
jealousy of them all prior to my engagement—though never
since, because she had never afforded the slightest excuse for
remonstrances.
Whereupon she was again flooded with tears, which stirred my
heart with tender commiseration; for her maidenly distress did
only increase her charms to infinity. And the Judge, feeling
fatherly sympathy for myself, observed very kindly that I had
got my answer, which he hoped might do me much good. For
which good wLsh I thanked him gratefully; and the Court was
again dissolved in senseless oachinnations!
Next I cross-questioned her as to her refusal of my offer to
marry on the ground that I was already the husband of one
infant wife, and whether it was not the fact. She responded
that I had referred her to Mr. CHUCKERBUTTY RAM for eorrobora-
tion of my story, and that he had informed her that my said
wife was a deceased.
Here I cleverly took the legal objection that what Mr. RAM
said was not evidence, and warned her to ba careful, while the
Hon'ble Judge partly upheld my contention, remarking that it
was evidence that a conversation was held, but not of the truth
of the facts stated in such conversation, thereby showing clearly
that he did not credit her story.
Upon the whole, I am confident that I have at least silenced
the guns of WITHERINGTON, Q.C., for upon the conclusion of my
cross-examination, he admitted that he had no further questions
to ask the plaintiff!
My solicitor says I shall have to buck myself up if I am to re-
duce the damages to any reasonable amount, and that he had
been desirous from the first to brief WITHEBINGTON. But this is
to croak like a raven, for the cross-examining is, after all, of very
minor importance compared to the Gift of the Gab—in which I
am notoriously nulli secundas.
2.15 P.M.—The Court has returned. WITHERINQTON'S Junior
has called JESSIMINA'S mother, whom I shall presently have the
bounden but rather painful duty to cross-axamine sharply.
Already I experience serious sinkings in stomach department.
Sursum corda! I must buck it up.
A BISHOP'S IDEAS ON LADIES' IDEALS.
THE Bishop of HEREFORD, in distributing the prizes at the
Redland Girls' High School at Bristol, as reported in the Daily
Telegraph, said : —
"Tbore was one'ideal against which he ventured to warn young women,
especially of the upper and middle classes, viz., the ideal of aping men's
fashions and manners. He sometimes eaw very smart young ladifs in waiet-
ooats and so on, which suggested imitation of men, and he always felt it was a
mistake."
Miss M IDIJI.H in s i is of opinion that this attack comes with a
very bad grace from a smart, middle-aged man who attires
himself in 'lawn sleeves," an "apron," and "so on," and she
would like to know his feelings on that subject.
"THE only Patti Concert" was announced for last Saturday.
Would it not have been even more correct to have styled it. "The
Concert of 'the Only РАТП ' "?

I desire to see to arrive the fifty-four carriages of which one has

by a time of the most frightfuls. He rains, as at the ordinary
in your country at the occasion of any assembly in full air.
Quel climat! Not only that, but, the sky being covered, be makes
himself already obscure, even before the hour of the going to
bed of the sun, and also he makes a wind truly frightening, in
effect one half-gale. What time for the unhappy automobiliste!
At cause of the obscurity, and of the crowd. I see not anything
from the windows of the hotel, and I am obliged of to endorse
my "mackintosh" and of to go out.
Quel temps! Impossible ofto hold an umbrella! And in Eng-
land one carnee not a capuchon for to cover the head, as in
France. However see there much of charming misses, who walk
themselves by a time as that, without to trouble themselves, the
least of the world, of the rain, of the wind, or of the mud. And
what mud—all as at London! Not only young mi&ses, but
also old ladies, old ones—vieillards—little childs, all are there.

riages," for he must to distinguish at present. All, ezcepted the
automobiles!
He makes black, but all the world continues of to walk himself
at the electric light. And see there, after to have attended
during three quarters of an hour, without anything to see ex-
cepted the crowd, all to blow, tout à coup, I smell an odour of
oil—ah but, an odour of the most disheartenings, écœurantes!—
and I perceive a little carriage, conducted by a man. in costume
of "yachtman," with a droll of bonnet, colonne of gold. The
little carriage is followed of two other carnages and of two other
odours of oil, still more disheartening, and, after some time, of
an electric carriage, absolutely without odour. Voilà tout 1 All
see to arrive four carriages, absolutely covered of mud, and one
distinguishes them at pain in the obscurity, excepted by the
odour of the oil and by the vaearme of the mechanism. Truly
it is an historic occasion, the inauguration of the carriage of the
future, but extremely disagreeable by a so villain time.
Me I am myself horribly enrheumed. Since that I have had
the crip, the influenza, there in some years, a rheum of brain is
a veritable malady for me. Je me mouche, I pocket-handkerchief
myself, absolutely without cease, j'éternuc éternellement, I sneeze
eternally, I have bad at the head, bad at the throat, bad at the
eyes. Ordinarily of a natural enough gay. I become a miserable
pessimist, incapable of anything to do. I say all this for to ex-
plain for what I write this so longtime after.
But in verity one sees some automobiles at Brighton, and by a
superb time, all the days since the fourteen, above all the six-
teen—all sorts of carriages, the most part as those that I have
already seen at Paris. And all the world speaks but of that. It
is that which the English call "a new craziness." Even the
respectable and ancient "Chainpier" becomes an automobile,
and goes gently towards the east. In fine perhaps the " Pavilion,"
that droll of palace of GKOKQK FOUR, will part also, en route to

At cause of the obscurity, and of the crowd. I see not anything

themselves by a time as that, without to trouble themselves, the
least of the world, of the rain, of the wind, or of the mud. And
what mud—all as at London! Not only young misses, but
also old ladies, old ones—rii itlnril*—little childs, all are there.

He makes black, but all the world continues of to walk himself
at the electric light. And see there, after to have attended
during three quarters of an hour, without anything to see ex-
cepted the crowd, all to blow, tout •; coup, I smell an odour of
oil—ah but, an odour of the most disheartenings, écœurante»!—
and I perceive a little carriage, conducted by a man. in costume
of "yachtman," with a droll of bonnet, galonné of gold. The
little carriage is followed of two other carnages and or two other
odours of oil, still more disheartening, and, after some time, of
an electric carriage, absolutely without odour. Voilà tout! All
see to arrive four carriages, absolutely covered of mud, and one
distinguishes them at pain in the obscurity, excepted by the
odour of the oil and by the rotarme of the mechanism. Truly
it is an historic occasion, the inauguration of the carriage of the
future, but extremely disagreeable by a so villain time.
Me I am myself horribly enrheumed. Since that I have had
the цпр, the influenza, there in some years, a rheum of brain is
a veritable malady for me. Je me mouche, I pocket-handkerchief
myself, absolutely without cease, féternue éternellement, I sneeze
eternally, I have bad at the head, bad at the throat, bad at the
eyes. Ordinarily of a natural enough gay, I become a miserable
pessimist, incapable of anything to do. I say all this for to ex-
plain for what I write this so longtime after.
But in verity one sees some automobiles at Brighton, and by a
superb time, all the days since the fourteen, above all the six-
teen—all sorts of carriages, the most part as those that I have
already seen at Paris. And all the world speaks but of that. It
is that which the English call "a new craziness." Even the
respectable and ancient "Chainpier" becomes an automobile,
and goes gently towards the east. In fine perhaps the " Pavilion,"
that droUof palace of OEOROB FOUR, will part also, en route to

LIFE among savages is apparently mild compared to the ordi-
nary existence of a schoolboy, especially in Hit First Year at
School, by ALFRED WEST (FISHER UNWIN). His time was any-
thing but a peaceful one. • Ragging " and "rotting," with many
other modern terms for torture, are suggestive or capital fun,
except for the unhappy victim. But the result is effective, the
process of evolution admirable through which the namby-pamby
individual develops into an every-day youth.
In writing The Life of Archbiihop Macee (ISBISTER), Dr. MAC-
DONNKÍ.L lias enjoyed the advantage of finding a sequence of
letters from the pen of Dr. MAOEE, which, with -here and there
a deft touch, suffice to tell the story. This is the best way a bio-
graphy may be written. It is, however, doubtful whether, had Dr.
MAOEB been in a position, to be consulted, he would have con-
sented to the publication of all the letters which appear in these
volumes. There is, for example, one addressed from Spain to
his friend Dr. MACÜONNELI,, then a curate in County Carlow.
"If I were in your place," he writes, "I should borrow without
scruple for my sermons. It is the only debt a man is not obliged to
repay." For an unsophisticated layman like my Baronite this is a
little startling. Suppose the analogous case of a journalist preach-
ing hie weekly sermon in, say, the Spectator. Suppose, in order
to fill up his appointed space and earn his apportioned fee, he
were to delve out of back numbers articles by other hands,
furbish them up to suit time and occasion, and pass them off
upon an unsuspecting editor as his own. What would be said
of such a sinner in quiet country parishes? Another section of
the correspondence which grates upon the sensitive lay mind, un-
suspicious of such things in Rectories and Deaneries, is evidence
of hankering after professional promotion. Once MAOEE permitted
himself to utter the frankest complaint of a bishop who had been
an unconscionably long time dying. "The Bishopric of Meatb,"
he writes, on August 1, 1886, "would, I believe. Hve been
mine had Dr. SINGER'S death taken place just three weeks
sooner than it did. Three weeks of an expiring and eepynineb
plies." Whilst this inconsiderate man lingered on, clinging
to Ufe with reprehensible selfishness, Earl RUSSELL, who
would have promoted the Dean of Cork, was turned out of
office, and Lord DEBBY, who had other clerical friends to serve,
took his place. Hence these angered tears over the bier of
the dallying bishop. From a historical point of view,
MAGEB'S letters penned during the progress of the fight
over the Irish Church Bill are the most interesting and
valuable portion of the book. On every page he dis-
closes his inner self, supplying rare opportunity for the
study of a man. Occasionally he sums himself up in a phrase.
"You will think me," he writes, in April, 1873, "a strangely
pugnacious bishop." Three years later he declares, "I ought to
have been the editor of a Radical newspaper instead of jbeing
a Conservative bishop." If for "ought we read "might"
this is very true. As his career was shaped it was infinitely
better. The editor of a Radical paper is a commonplace of
humanity as compared with a MAGEB on the Episcopal Bench.
The letters will rank among the best in the English language.
The sentences follow each other like hammer strokes, each one
hitting the nail.
Let us praise heroes. The Life of Nelson, by SOUTHBY,

neatness and daintiness of the binding of this DENT'S production,

Powerfully told is the sad story of A Child of the Jago, by
ARTHUR MORRISON, published by METHUEN. It seems to the
Baron as though the author had been inspired to write a
modern version of that hideous and squalid part of DICKBNS'S
Oliver Twist, in which old Fagin, BUI Sites, Nancy, Charley
Bates, and the Dodger are the principal actors. In the action
of the hypocritical "fence" there is also a touch of our old friend
"Melter Moss" in Том TAYLOR'S Ticket-of-Leave Man who, in
the drama, went to the merchant's office to "split" on Bob
Brierly, just as Weech, in this tale, ruins the prospecte of the un-
fortunate Dicky Perrott. The flight of the criminal after the
murder recalls both that of Bill Sikes and Jonas Chuzzlemt, undei
similar circumstances. The description of the great fight be-
tween Josh Perrott and Billy Leahy is a master-piece. A glossary
of thieves' slang—or the slang of The Jago—Bought to appear as
appendix. It is horribly, detestably fascinating.
Except that Amyas is true to his Géraldine, the story of Sir
Amyas, Cavalier, up to a certain point is that of the ballad of
Billy Taylor, whom his " true love followed after under the name
of Richard Carr," disguised as a sailor. So Géraldine, dis-
guised as a youthful soldier, follows her lover, Amyas, and
becomes his wedded wife while yet "masking as a cornet of the
king's horse." The interest of the story ends with the discovery and
the marriage, in the middle of the book. After that, all about
King CHARLES and OLIVER is rieux jeu. Mr. M. H. HERVEY'S Sir

TO ARMS!
IN the Saturday Review a writer, signing himself "X," an
unknown quantity, has recently started a series of articles headed
the "Snobbery of it," in which he shows how certain new men,
and some old ones too, ambitiously eager to possess heraldic
devices associated with ancient houses and noble lineage, have
rushed in where Dukes feared to tread. The title of "X " 's
articles might have been more appropriately "Robbery and Snob-


bery Under Arms." But, we ask, why hark back to ancient and
well-worn devices? Why not commence a new era? Why not
let our Millionaires of the Moment and Newly-Titled Ones send
to Mr. Punch's own Heraldic Artist for their arms, which will
always be ready to hand on the shortest notice, and for their
quarterings, which will be provided "while you wait F" We

IN the Saturday Review a writer, signing himself "X," an
unknown quantity, has recently started a series of articles headed
the Snobbery of it," in which he shows how certain new men,

rushed in where Dukes feared to tread. The title of "X"'s
articles might have been more appropriately " Robbery and Snob-

well-worn devices? Why not commence a new era? Why not

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.


HINTS FROM OUR INVENTOR'S NOTE-BOOK.
PATENT CONVERTIBLE KNIFE-GRINDING SAFETY.
DARBY JONES AT DERBY.
HONOURED SIB, — It has often puzzled
me why the Midland Railway Company
should have its headquarters at the town
which for so many years was associated
with the political fame of Mr. SAMUEL
PLIMSOLL, Sir WILLIAM VERNON HARCOURT
and Sir THOMAS ROE—the latter an emi-
nent authority on soft sawdust. We Lon-
doners, who gaze with awe on the wide-
spreading span of St. Paneras Station,
frequently forpot that the directors, who
see no medium between First and Third-
class passengers, issue all their edicts from
a place whence both the Lord of KNOWS-
I.KY and the Blue Ribbon of the Turf
derive their appellations. I confess that
I like Derby, quite apart from racing or
railway reminiscences. There is a certain
air of "Treed on my toes and I '11 walk on
yours" about the inhabitants. They don't
hesitate in their method, they do it, as I
know to my cost, after inadvertently com-
ing in contact with a citizen whose feet
were considerably larger in space than thi:t
accorded to most of the Queen's subjects.
His language corresponded with his weight
carriers. It was very heavy and broad, and
I am still dependent on a couple of walk-
ing-sticks. Nevertheless, I like Derby,
and it was in honour of Sir W ALTER SCOTT
and the late Lord TENNYSON that I placed
my humble "fiver" on Northern Farmer
for the Chesterfield Nursery Stakes, not a
bad solution where no less than a score of
two-year-olds were engaged. Albeit, I am
strongly averse from this kind of race at
the close of the season. Young quadru-
peds ought in November to be housed for
the winter. Many a promising four-footed
performer have I known ruined for life by
appearing in public at a time when sensi-
ble bipeds are preparing to wing their cus-
tomary flight to Monte Carlo or Algiers.
And surely babies, be they colt or filly,
require a little nursing? I notice, hon-
oured Sir, that you (in addition to other
superfluous and crude remarks) inquire
"Who is the Lovely Lady?" I regret that,
consistently with Honour and High Prin-
ciples, such as have always, I trust, been
my Goals in Life, I cannot satisfy your
extravagant curiosity as to the Divinity,
and was truly inspired by the Blessing
say that she is fair as an Oleander in the
south of France, wise as a rattlesnake of
far-distant Florida, and as sagacious as the
pig, which, I understand, discovers the lus-
cious truffle for the wanderer interested in
the manufacture of Strasburg pies. I
must therefore ask you, with all deference
to your high status, not to seek to reveal
the identity of the Lovely Lady. Your in-
discretion in alluding to her has, despite
my crippled state, compelled the acquaint-
ance of a Supple Ash plant with the
shoulders of an Imprudent Baronet. As
they say in the classics, "a little know-
ledge often makes a dangerous sting."
Therefore, ал Mr. JOHN HAWKE, the in-
dustrious secretary of the Anti-Gambling
League, knows to his cost, it is dangerous
to be over curious. "Herewith I drop the
subject," ne the Barbery Ape said when he
handled the over-roasted potato. Like
NANSEN to the Pole, I now turn to those
items in which I know you, Sir, deepit?
your feigned callousness, have an interest
second to none. How it has gladdened my
heart to watch you surreptitiously hover-
ing about TATTERSAI.L'S Ring, endeavour-
ing to get a better price about your pet
fancy than the market justified I I believe
that you even shaved on one occasion in

DEAR MR. PUNCH,—Will you, like the
dear old darling that you are, please tell
some of the gentlemen who hunt with us
that we are not all New Women. It is
very well for Lady HENRY SOMERSET to
talk about the equality of the sexes, but I
frankly confess that I like a lead from one
of the others. Also, when I get a "spill,"
as I did the other day, I don't appreciate
being left for dead. I really think that
the "Manners of Modern Men" would
make just as good a subject for discussion
in the newspapers as the ways of children.
I know tl.a t certain of Vny sisters, who
never took anything higher than the plat-
form at St. James's Hall, are responsible
for the inattention which we now receive:
but, belirve me, we, who are (what shall I
say?) "Liberal Unionists?" like to be
shown that courteous attention which has
been our prerogative ever since the world
began with the deception of Woman. We
don't nrnd being hurt, but we do hate be-
ing crvxhcd by neglect. I also know that
a great many selfish men dislike our hunt-
ing at all. Why, we are born huntresses
as our mothers were before us! And when
we have run our prey to a satisfactory
finish, we treat him with tenderness and
often with affection. Only let the young
cavaliers not neglect their opportunities.
Personally I don't care much about a gato
being owned, but several of my friends do.
They likewise want to be fished out of a
brook. Therefore, dear Mr. Plinth, ask
these sportsmen to remember that the old
(I mean metaphorically) Woman still ex-
ists, and oblige

SIGNS OF THE TIMES IN THE LOWTHER ARCADE.
OUR BOOKING -OFFICE.
READING Sentimental Tommy, Mr. BARRIE'S last book, pub-
lished by CASSELL, there have been recurrent moments when my
Haronite has doubted whether the story might not be more
aptly entitled. Tiresome Tommy more precisely describes the
prodigy through a quite unreasonable number of pages. The
Jacobite rising, the siege of Thrums, and one or two other
chapters of ponderously precise fantasy, is, to tell the unvar-
nished truth, almost enough to make one or the most apprecia-
tive and faithful of Mr. BAHHIE'S admirers lay down the un-
finished book. But here and there, shining through this dog-
gerel of narrative, like threads of gold in a mass of sacking, are
episodes of humour and pathos which testify that the Window in
Thrums is not yet built up. Of such are Hogmanay kept in a
London slum, and the home-taking of Grizd by the old doctor.
The strongest writing is at the beginning, setting forth the life
and death of Tommy's mother, wherein appears the beautiful
and pathetic Hogmanay incident. Mr. BARBIE is ludicrously in
love with Sentimental Tommy, whereas far away the best charac-
ter in the book is Grizel.
A delightful quality about Rodney Stone (SMITH, ELDEB) is its
lilting "go." There is not a dull page in it from first to last.
All is light, colour, movement, blended and inspired by a master
hand. vVhen my Baronite read the fight in the coach-house he
thought it one of the most breathless exercises he had ever
taken, book in hand. So it was till some chapters later he
came upon the narrative of the smith's last battle. Like the
first, it was, alack! a prize fight. Told by CONAN DOYLE, the sub-
ject is ennobled till it becomes quite as respectable and far more
stirring than a set-to between SALADIN and RICHABD CŒUB DE
LION. Embroidered on the story are picturesque scenes of life
in the time of GEOBGE THE FOURTH, reproduced with amazing
vividness. It seems so easily done. But as Dr. CONAN DOYLE
indicates in a preface, a considerable amount of study preceded
the undertaking. Amongst the authorities to whom he avows
his indebtedness for information upon the subject of the ring
is Mr. J. C. PARKINSON. My Baronite knew that "J. C. P."
was, amongst other things, a bard, accustomed to inaugurate
Eisteddfoddau arrayed in becoming Druidical costume. But
h.e never knew he was an accepted authority on ring matters.
Which shows how little the world knows of its greatest men.
HENKY JAMES is indifferent Anthony Trollopeian and second-
class Meredithian. The Judicious Skipper will find plenty
of exercise for his literary athletics in both volumes.*
"Oh, my dear man 1" "Oh, my dear woman!" all these con-
versationalists say to one another for pages and pages, and we
"don't get no furrader." Paul Vidal и a kind of flabby re-
incarnation of Mr. Toots, with the letter's "it's of no conse-
quence." In this story nobody is of any particular conse-

* By the way, before the Baron took supreme charge of this office in Mr.

drummingly; and young ladies ask young gentlemen to sit down
beside them and talk, and they do talk and talk; and only once
is there a dramatic situation. Tony, the drowned child's father,
howls and breaks into a storm of sobs: Rose, "with a passionate
wail," throws herself on the grass; the doctor "looks from one
prostrate figure to the other," as well he may, and curtain de-
scends on end of Book Second. Then Book Third: more dreary
dialogue. And when the secret is revealed the question must
occur, Was it worth going through so much to learn so little?
Yet, HENRY JAMES is a favourite with reviewers and readers of
the very superior sort.
"From the Aldine Press Messrs. DENT & Co. have already
sent forth the first of The Temple Classics, edited by ISRAEL
GOLLANCZ, M.A., consisting of a neat, handy-shaped book, con-
taining WILLIAM WORDSWORTH'S Prelude. The poet became a
Johnian Undergraduate at Cambridge in 1787, being then just
seventeen years of age. Young men went up a year or so earlier
in those days than they do now; yet do his notes show
that, in spite of many alterations, there is really very little
change in the ancient University within the last hundred years
since WORDSWORTH caught his first " glimpse of Cam,"
"And at the ' Hoop ' alighted, famous inn."
Then the youthful poet's account of the "motley spectacle " : —
"Gowns grave, or gaudy, doctors, students, streets,
Courts, cloisters, Hocks of churches, gateways, towers."
And how pleased he was
"With invitations, suppers, wine and fruit,
Smooth housekeeping within, and all without
Liberal and suiting gentleman's array."
A light on academical ways in the past, on the banks of the
Cam, and a link with the present, this handy volume, with useful
silken marker sewn in, is a pleasure and a treasure.
The Missing Prince, by G. E. FARROW (HtrrcHiNsoN & Co.).
An extra special sort or fairy nightmare, likely to visit any
youthful dreamer of dreams when retiring to bed with their
ideas somewhat mixed. It ought to fascinate the aesthetic taste
of cultured nursery folk. Mr. HARBY FURNISB and his daughter
DOROTHY comically and daintily illustrate the book.
For quite little people SHEILA E. BRAINE has worked up a new
theory of how that cackling hen of old travelled To tell the King
the Sky was Vailing. Molly and Max, who follow in her claw
prints, come across many ancient acquaintances only to be met
with in the happy hunting-ground of Fairyland. Delightful
illustrations by ALICE WOODWARD complete the story, which is on
the catalogue of BLACKIE & SONS.

DKAB Мк. PUNCH, — The plot of Under the Bed Eobe,

mits a crime which brings him into the power of a great
French statesman. His life is offered to him on the con-
dition that he goe< to the frontier to bring back to Paris a, man
hateful to the powers that be. If he does not do this his fate is
the scaffold. The spendthrift accepts the. hateful mission. He
goes to the frontier, and falls in lone with the sister of the man he
is bound to betray. In the nick of time he repents, and return« to
Pans ready to forfeit his life in satisfaction of his mission un-
performed. He is followed by the woman he loves. But thanks
to a shuffle of the cards of fate, the man who can crush him
ceases to be powerful, and all ends happily.
A capital idea, but I have come across it before. How about
this. Figure to yourself a ladv instead of a man. This lady is
also a spendthrift. She has fallen into the power of Fouche
while devoted to the gaming table. At the right moment she is
told that she must lure back to Paris a man hateful to the powers
that be. If she does not—exposure. She accepts the hateful
task. She follows the man to the frontier and falls in love with
him. In the nick of time she repents and returns to Paris, ready
to pay the sacrifice of her mission unperformed. She is followed
by the man she loves. But thanks to a shuffle of the cards of
fate, the man who can crush her ceases to be powerful, and all

Are not these plots very similar? One is the story of Under

the Fouche of Plot and Passion. Then Marie de Fontanges—

Mr. Jabberjec's Opening for tlie Defence.
Queen's Bench Court, No. . 2.40 P.M.
1 HAVE just resumed my seat after a rather searching examina-
tion of Madam MANKLETOW, as will appear from the notes of her
evidence kindly taken by my solicitor: —
MY SOLICITOR'S SAID NOTKS.
Mrs. MARTHA MANKLETOW (formidable old party—all bügle*
ami bombazine). Would certainly describe her establishment as
fashionable and select. All her male boarders perfect gentlemen
—except defendant. Was never anxious to secure him for her
daughter—on the contrary, would have much preferred her son-
in-law white. Gave her consent because of the passionate attach-
ment he professed for plaintiff. Nothing to her whether he was
of princely rank or not. He appeared to be very well able to
support her daughter, which was the chief thing. Had never
threatened defendant with personal chastisement from other
boarders if he denied any engagement. Did say that if he meant
nothing serious after all the marked attentions he had paid the

Mr. Justice Honcygall.
plaintiff, he deserved to be cut dead by all the gentlemen in the
house. Insisted on the engagement being made public at once;
thought it her bounden duty to do so. Did not know whether
defendant waa married already, or how many wives he was en-
titled to in his own country—ne had taken good care not to say
anything about all that when he proposed. Did not consider him
a desirable match, and never had done, but thought he ought to
be made to pay heavily for his heartless behaviour to her poor
unprotected child, who would never get over the slight of being
jilted by a black man.
Here I sat down, amidst suppressed murmurs from the Court
of indignation and sympathy at suoh gross unmannerly insults
to a highly-educated Indian University man and qualified native
barrister.
3.15.—More witnesses for plaintiff, viz., Miss SPINK and sundry
select boarders, who have testified to my courtship and the
notoriety of my engagement. Seeing that they were predeter-
mined not to answer favourably to myself, I tore a leaf out of
Mister WITHERINGTON'S book, and said that I had no questions to
ask. . . . The plaintiff's junior has just sat down, with the
announcement that that is his case. I am now to turn the tables
by dint of rhetorical loquacity. . . .
The annexed report, though sadly meagre, and doing very
scanty justice to the occasion, is furnished by my friend young
HOWARD, who was present in Court at the time.
Jab. (in a kind of sing-song). May it please your venerable
Lordship and respectable gentlemen of the jury¡ I am in the
very similar predicant -nt of another celebrated native gentleman
and well-known character in the dramatic works of your immortal
sion of his pleading before the Duke and other potent, grave,
and reverent signiere of Venice, in a speech which I shall com-
mence by quoting in full
Mr. Justice IloneygaU. One moment, Mr. JABBERJEE, I am
always reluctant to interfere with Counsel, but it may save my
time and that of the jury if I remind you that the illustration
you propose to give us is hardly as happy as it might be. The head
and front of OTHELLO'S offending, unless I am mistaken, was that
he had married the lady of his affections, whereas in your
Jab. (plaintively). Your lordship, it is not humanly possible
that I can exhibit even ordinary eloquence if I am to be inter-
rupted by far-fetched and frivolous objections. The story of
OTHELLO
Л/г. Justice H. What the jury want to hear is not OTHELLO'S
story, but yours, Sir, and your proper course is to go into the
witness-box at once, and give your version of the facts as simply
and straightforwardly as you can. When you have given you'r
own evidence and called any witnesses you may wish to call, you

spout and WON'T keep to the point; but, all the same, I fancy, some-

plaintiff's a devilish fine girl, and gave her evidence uncommonly
well; but, unless WITHERINGTON turns up again, I believe old JAU

barefaced attempt to bleed and mulct a poor impecunious Indian.

all beheld in this box, it is incredible, I say, that she should
seriously desire to become a mere unconsidered unit in a bevy
of Indian brides! How is she possibly to endure a domestic ex-
istence exposed to the slings and arrows of perpetual snip-snaps
from various native aunts and sisters-in-law, or how is she to
reconcile her dainty and fastidious stomach, after the luscious and
appetising fare of a Bayswater boarding-house, to simple, un-

NOTE BY MR. JABBERJEE.—Hereford Road, Bayswater.—I am
excessively gratified by the result of my first day's trial, being
already the established favourite and chartered libertine of tin
whole Court, whoeplit their sides at my slightest utterances. So
I am no longer immeasurably alarmed by the prospect of being
crossly examined—especially since WITHHRINOTON, Q.C., haï
abandoned his brief in despair to a tongue-tied junior, who is in-
competent to exclaim Bo! at a goose. Indeed, I have some
thoughts of declining haughtily to be interrogated by a mere
underling.
The only fly in the ointment of my success is the utter in-
difference of JESSIMINA to my aforesaid triumphs. At the ter-
mination of the hearing to-day, I beheld her so deeply engrossée!
in smiling and cordial converse with the smartly-attired curly-
headed young solicitor who is acting on her behalf that she was
totally unconscious of my vicinity!

DARBY JONES ON TURF TOPICS ESPECIALLY BELGIAN.
HONOURED SIR,—It may perhaps have escaped even your
Argus-liko eyes that the Belgian Government, with a fatherly
care, which would not disgrace Mr. JOHN MORLEY or Sir WIL-
FRID LAWSON, is about to bring in a Measure for the Regulation
of Betting, and, I may add, of Touts and Turf Prophets. Should
this Bill become law, speculation on all Foreign Races will be pro-
hibited, and wagering only permitted on Home Events. Thus
the British Exile in Brussels will no longer be enabled to back his
fancy for the Derby or Leger at the Taverne Anglais or some
other home of the Alien, but must invest his francs personally at
Grœnendal or Spa. It is a magnificent scheme for keeping all
the ready money in the country, and it comes well from a
country whose king is largely interested in a plan for converting
Ostend into a Northern Monte Carlo, conveniently adjacent to
the oof-laden shores of England, whence it is trusted many
pigeons may be imported in exchange for the rabbits of the
locality. The sale or Racing Information will also be prohibited.
The Belgian DARBY JONESES are to have their eyes put out like
the wretched singing-birds which, sightless, warble for wagers
from the Scheldt to the Meuse, and from the German Ocean to
the Prussian frontier, without interference from the authorities.
Equally the journals devoted to "le sport" will be forbidden to
insert the advertisements of tipsters, so I suppose that our own
Eminent Organs of the Turf will be denied sale at the kiosques,
or have spaces "blacked out," after the custom of the Russian
Censors of the Press.
But this is not all. Racecourses are to be licensed by Govern-
ment for betting purposes, the gambling to be carried on only in
certain enclosures, one inside and another outside, admission to
which will be given on payment of a Premium of fifty per cent,
on the entrance money! This will be the only profit which race-
courses are to derive from turf speculation. I confess that I do
not understand the last articje of the New Code. Does it mean
that gate-money is to be abolished, or what? Like a Member of
Parliament at question-time—I pause for a reply.
In The Dodd Family Abroad, honoured Sir, the inimitable
wit of CHARLES LEVER finds abundant scope for flourishing like
a mango-tree in Western Africa over the description of a
Belgian racecourse. Racing among les braves Belges was then in
its First Childhood. It is now apparently in its Second, so soon
does an infant not indigenous to the soil perish when transplanted
from the home of its birth. You are aware that I am personally
in favour of Licensed Bookmakers authorised by the Jockey Club,
but my most Utopian ideas never soared to the spectacle of
Government interference. I would suggest to the Belgian au-
thorities that only Government Meetings should be allowed,
under the supervision of a Ministre du Sport Hippique, that at
these gatherings there should be a number of Knights of the
Pencil (Chevaliers du Crayon) in Uniform, and decorated ac-
cording to their grades, that the Race-cards should be Govern-
ment Gazettes, that the Jockeys should be chozen from the Bel-
gian Cavalry and ride inUniform, that the Judge should be selected
from the Bench of the Palais de Justice, and that the Horses
engaged, all bearing a Government Stamp, should only be those
hard-working, but not over speedy quadrupeds for which the
fair land of Flanders has been celebrated from time immemorial,
and which frequently do a little racing between the shafts of a
London Omnibus.
There is a rock, Sir, off the east coast of the Land of Cakes
known as the Bass. It is celebrated as the breeding-place of that
bandeóme fowl called the Solan Goose. It appears to me that
Brussels must be the chosen nesting ground of a less well-

Queen's Bench Court, No. . 2.40 P.M.
I HAVE just resumed my seat after a rather searching examina-
tion of Madam MANKLETOW, as will appear from the notes of her
evidence kindly taken by my solicitor: —
MY SOLICITOR'S SAID NOTES.
Mrs. MARTHA MANKLETOW (formidable old party—all buglr*
and bombazine). Would certainly describe her establishment as
fashionable and select. All her male boarders perfect gentlemen
—except defendant. Was never anxious to secure him for her
daughter—on the contrary, would have much preferred her son-
in-law white. Gave her consent because of the passionate attach-
ment he professed for plaintiff. Nothing to her whether he was
of princely rank or not. He appeared to be very well able to
support her daughter, which was the chief thing. Had never
threatened defendant with personal chastisement from other
boarders if he denied any engagement. Did say that if he meant
nothing serious after all the marked attentions he had paid the

Mr. Justice Honeygnll.
plaintiff, he deserved to be cut dead by all the gentlemen in the
house. Insisted on the engagement being made public at once;
thought it her bounden duty to do so. Did not know whether
defendant waa married already, or how many wives he was en-
titled to in his own country—he had taken good care not to say
anything about all that when he proposed. Did not consider him
a desirable match, and never had done, but thought he ought to
be made to pay heavily for his heartless behaviour to her poor
unprotected child, who would never get over the slight of being
jilted by a black man.
Here I sat down, amidst suppressed murmurs from the Court
of indignation and sympathy at such gross unmannerly insults
to a highly-educated Indian University man and qualified native
barrister.
3.15.—More witnesses for plaintiff, viz., Miss SPINK and sundry
select boarders, who have testified to my courtship and the
notoriety of my engagement. Seeing that they were predeter-
mined not to answer favourably to myself, I tore a leaf out of
Mister WITHERINGTON'S book, and said that I had no questions to
ask. . . . The plaintiff's junior has just sat down, with the
announcement that that is his case. I am now to turn the tables
by dint of rhetorical loquacity. . . .
The annexed report, though sadly meagre, and doing very
scanty justice to the occasion, is furnished by my friend young
HOWARD, who was present in Court at the time.

and reverent signiprs of Venice, in a speech which I shall com-
mence by quoting in full
Mr. Justice Honeygall. One moment, Mr. JABBERJEE, I am
always reluctant to interfere with Counsel, but it may save my
time and that of the jury if I remind you that the illustration
you propose to give us is hardly as happy as it might be. The head

For it is incredible that any English female, of genteel upbring-

all beheld in this box, it is incredible, I say, that she should
seriously desire to become a mere unconsidered unit in a bevy
of Indian brides! How is she possibly to endure a domestic ex-
istence exposed to the slings and arrows of perpetual snip-snaps
from various native aunts and sisters-in-law, or how is she to
reconcije her dainty and fastidious stomach, after the luscious and
appetising fare of a Bayswater boarding-house, to simple, un-
ostentatious, and frequently repulsive Indian eatables? No,

to you in cross-examination, and that must stand over till to-
morrow. (At this, old Jab's jaw falls several holes.)
NOTE BY MR. .I.UIHKH.TKK,—Hereford Road, Sayswater.—I am
excessively gratified by the result of my first day's trial, being
already the established favourite and chartered libertine of tin
whole Court, who split their sides at my slightest utterances. So
I am no longer immeasurably alarmed by the prospect of being
crossly examined—especially since WITHBRINGTON, Q.C., has
abandoned his brief in despair to a tongue-tied junior, who is in-
competent to exclaim Bo I at a goose. Indeed, I have some
thoughts of declining haughtily to be interrogated by a mere
underling.
The only fly in the ointment, of my success is the utter in-
difference of JESSIMINA to my aforesaid triumphs. At the ter-
mination of the hearing to-day, I beheld her so deeply engrossed
in smiling and cordial converse with the smartly-attired curly-
headed young solicitor who is acting on her behalf that she was
totally unconscious of my vicinity!
Alackaday! varium et mutabile semper fcernina!
DARBY JONES ON TURF TOPICS ESPECIALLY BELGIAN.
HONOURED SIR,—It may perhaps have escaped even your
Argus-like eyes that the Belgian Government, with a fatherly
care, which would not disgrace Mr. JOHN MORLEY or Sir WIL-
FRID LAWSON, is about to brine in a Measure for the Regulation
of Betting, and, I may add, of Touts and Turf Prophets. Should
this Bill become law, speculation on all Foreign Races will be pro-
hibited, and wagering only permitted on Home Events. Thus
the British Exile in Brussels will no longer be enabled to back his
fancy for the Derby or Leger at the Taverne Anglais or some
other home of the Alien, but must invest his francs personally at
Grœnendal or Spa. It is a magnificent scheme for keeping all
the ready money in the country, and it comes well from a
country whose king is largely interested in a plan for converting
Ostend into a Northern Monte Carlo, conveniently adjacent to
the oof-laden shores of England, whence it is trusted many
pigeons may be imported in exchange for the rabbits of the
locality. The sale or Racing Information will also be prohibited.
The Belgian DARBY JONESES are to have their eyes put out like
the wretched singing-birds which, sightless, warble for wagers
from the Scheldt to the Meuse, and from the German Ocean to
the Prussian frontier, without interference from the authorities.
Equally the journals devoted to "le sport" will be forbidden to
insert the advertisements of tipsters, so I suppose that our own
Eminent Organs of the Turf will be denied sale at the kiosques,
or have spaces "blacked out," after the custom of the Russian
Censors of the Press.
But this is not all. Racecourses are to be licensed by Govern-
ment for betting purposes, the gambling to be carried on only in
certain enclosures, one inside and another outside, admission to
which will be given on payment of a Premium of fifty per cent,
on the entrance money! This will be the only profit which race-
courses are to derive from turf speculation. I confess that I do
not understand the last article or the New Code. Does it mean
that gate-money is to be abolished, or what? Like a Member of
Parliament at question-time—I pause for a reply.
In The Dodd Family Abroad, honoured Sir, the inimitable
wit of CHARLES LEVER finds abundant scope for flourishing like
a mango-tree in Western Africa over the description of a
Belgian racecourse. Racing among les braves Beiges was then in
its First Childhood. It is now apparently in its Second, so soon
does an infant not indigenous to the soil perish when transplanted
from the home of its birth. You are aware that I am personally
in favour of Licensed Bookmakers authorised by the Jockey Club,
but my most Utopian ideas never soared to the spectacle or
Government interference. I would suggest to the Belgian au-
thorities that only Government Meetings should be allowed,
under the supervision of a Ministre du Sport Hippique, that at
these gatherings there should be a number of Knights of the
Pencil (Chevaliers du Crayon) in Uniform, and decorated ac-
cording to their grades, that the Race-cards should be Govern-
ment Gazettes, that the Jockeys should be ehozen from the Bel-
gian Cavalry and ride inUniform, that the Judge should be selected
from the Bench of the Palais de Justice, and that the Horses
engaged, all bearing a Government Stamp, should only be those
hard-working, but not over speedy quadrupeds for which the
fair land of Flanders has been celebrated from time immemorial,
and which frequently do a little racing between the shafts of a
London Omnibus.
There is a rock, Sir, off the east coast of the Land of Cakes
known as the Base. It is celebrated as the breeding-place of that
handsome fowl called the Solan Goose. It appears to me that
Brussels must be the chosen nesting ground of a less well-

MATTHEW WTHITE RIDLEY might put it, to home affairs. I
trust that you did well at Warwick. It is useless for you to
deny that you care nothing for race-meetings. I could not be
deceived in the appearance of a Distinguished Personage, who.
although disguised in blue spectacles and a sealskin overcoat of
peerless fit, cut me as dead as Exmoor mutton at the entrance to
TATTEHSALL'S. I bear no malice that you remembered my
advice that of all dangerous folk at the end of the season
none are comparable to the Hibernian Cohorts. Si. Jarlath was
bound to annex, bar accidents, the Midland Counties Handicap,
and swell the receipts of the whiskey distillers in Dublin and
Belfast. There were other ripe plums for those who are about to
make Christmas puddings. The Lovely Lady wishes me to say
that she has a great admiration for you. As a Man of Honour I
;ive her message, but warn you that your future conduct will
e closely watched by
Your devoted, but suspicious adherent, DARBY JONES.

scoped; but I trust everyone backed my Belgian river, like a

(A fragment.)
THE Doctor and the Analyst
Walked on a mile or so,
And then they rested by a bar
Conveniently low;
And all the little oysters stood
And waited, in a row.
"The time has come," the Doctor said,
"To ask how there can be
At Grimsby, or at Cleethorp^s,
Or Southend on the Sea,
Bold, bad bacilli branded by
Bacteriology."
"Our characters," the oysters cried,
"Depend upon our chat;

They thanked him much for that.
"A microscope," the Doctor said,
"Is what we chiefly need;
Carbolic antiseptic, too,
Is very good indeed;

Turning a jittle green,
A tint investigators not
Infrequently have seen.
"A microscope," the Doctor said,
"Is such a nice machine."
"It was so kind of you to come

"But I would rather not
Partake of you in any form,
Not even boiling hot;
No doubt you are not all as bad,
But you 're a doubtful lot."
''Oh, Doctors," said the oysters then,
"If thus you cut and run,

CANINE SAGACITY.
EXTRAORDINARY MEMORY is A DOG,
DEAR SIB, — Seeing that you have
opened your columns to letters on the
subject of "canine sagacity," I thought
that your readers might be interested in
the following true story of canine memory.
I possess a retriever named Eucalyptus,
of remarkable intelligence, although now
getting on in years. The animal is very
affectionate so far as my family is con-
cerned, and his only failing is a disposition
to snap at every stranger who appears in
.sight. I must confess that his attitude to-
wards the postman and milkman leaves
much to be desired, but probably these
people have given him good .cause for irri-
tation, by their propensity for teasing.
A sailor cousin of mine was home from
the sea about seven years ago. He paid
Eucalyptus. At any rate, on leaving, he
deliberately tantalised the dog (who was
at a window) by offering him a large bone,
and then throwing it over the wall, before
his eyes. I told my cousin at the time
that the dog would never forgive him, but
he only laughed. Now for the sequel. A
fortnight ago, I received a second visit
from my cousin (his first had lasted two
days, the only time that Eutalyptux had
pver seen him), and within two minutes
of his arrival I heard a snarl and a snap.
Eucalyptus had bitten him in the leg!
For seven yrars that dog had cherished
his feelings of resentment over the bone
incident, and instantaneously recogmising
the author of the wrong, he had wreaked
his vengeance accordingly!
Yours faithfully, "COLONIAL."

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
(Letters from Mr. R. to his Nephew at Cambridge, and to Others.)
No. III.—OF FOOEYDOM—OF YOUNG MEN AND OLD—OF тнв
MAKING OF FRIENDS.
MY DEAR JACK,—We were speaking of friends and friendship
when I broke off my last letter. Before I say any more about
this subject I wish to enter a protest. In your letter to me you
speak of one of your respected dona as "a regular old fogey."
Now, JACK, is this fair or kind. The gentleman whom you so
contemptuously describe was a freshman when I took my degree!
If he is ancient, what am IP If he is to have a mansion in the
dull realms of fogeydom, I, your uncle, must have a habitation
there. I tell you honestly I don't like to be relegated, cvon by
implication, to dust and obscurity. No doubt you will answer
that the Reverend Mr. BIFBONS is as bald as a coot, while your
uncle still uses a hard brush for the arrangement of his hyacinth-
ine locks, but I cannot allow you to escape so easily. I know
DICKY BIFRONS well, but when I think of him he appears to me
as a_lad with a head of tousled hair, a particularly pink com-
E le xión, and not the slightest indication of a beard. I trust
e holds as pleasant a memory of me. Youth and age are
mere terms; they represent no absolute and invariable
realities. The oldest man I ever knew was Том SKINNER, a
freshman of my year. At eighteen he was a dried-up man of
the world, a withered compendium of depravity, for whom Ufe
had no savour left. He posed as a terrible killer of ladies, and
hinted darkly that the domestic happiness of a certain married
Professor depended upon his reticence. None of us took him
seriously; his antics and affectations were food for endless chaff.
Once when, in pulling out his handkerchief, he dropped a photo-
graph on the floor, and made a great show of picking it up
hurriedly and hiding it away lest prying eyes should discover the
secret or his Litest intrigue, we sprang upon him, wrenched his
treasure from him, and discovered a likeness of SKINNER himself,
taken in cap and gown, for the delectation of his family circle.
Somewhere in the provinces, I believe, he still lives on, a battered
for the young bloods of his district. If you asked me, on the
other hand, to name my youngest friend. I should point to dear
old LUCAS. Three years divide him from eighty; and in what
other man can you find so keen a zest in life, so hearty and fresh
an appreciation of all that is good and honourable and humorous
and friendly, so ardent a delight in
Youth and bloom and this delightful world.
His ufe has been passed in a constant and eager activity, yet he
is not wearied, and his laugh rings as full and true as that of
the youngest man amongst you.
And now as to your friends and the making of them. You
need not, of course, be over-genial or gushing as I have known
some men to be. But, on the other hand, I would not have you
to choose this man or to reject another as a friend in a cold
spirit of calculation, because, after observing him carefully, you
judge him to be suitable or otherwise for the high privilege of
your friendship. I call this the commercial principle applied to
friendship, and for myself I never could endure it. Some
men, only a few, I am thankful to believe, adopt it and act on it,
but most of us would abhor the notion of treating pur hearts as
though they were ledgers, entering a man's qualities on a sort
of debtor and creditor account, and striking a balance for him,
as thus : —
Mr. HENBY BHOWN in account with 3. ROUNDABOUT.
Dr.
A loud laugh.
Untidy clothes.
Great devotion to books.
A provincial accent.
Or.
Perfect amiability.
Willingness to oblige.
Unselfishness.
A full blue for hammer-throwing.
Leaving a small balance of friendship for poor BROWN to draw
upon. You can't choose your friends as you do your tailor,
your gyp, the pattern of your clothes, or the style of your neck-
ties. It a man has the true qualities, and you are fortunate
enough to meet him, you cannot but choose to make him your
friend, and that without conscious effort on your part or his.
I am assuming that you, too, have the true qualities, but the
assumption is not a dangerous one, for, if I know you at all, I
know you are what a lad should be—manly, candid, honourable,
unselfish, not personally vain, and a hater of meanness. You
meet another youngster in a tub on the river, you exchange a
few words, he makes you laugh, you walk up together, something
in his manner and his looks attracts you, the sympathetic glow
begins and you exchange confidences. He comes from Winter-
house, you were a Charchester boy, you were both in your
respective football and cricket teams, you both think tubbing
dull—will he come to your rooms after hall and smoke a pipe?
Probably at the end of the day each of you will have acquired
a life-long friend. But neither of you thought about the pro-
cess. A man may be on the surface all that hoary moralists
approve-;—steady, sober, thrifty, and all that, but at heart he may
be a prig, a humbug, and a mean rascal. Your instinct will
keep you from him, however much elderly ignoramuses may
urge you to choose so steady a model for your friend. When
a man is urgently recommended to my affection, I care not by
whom, on the ground of his goodness, his sobriety, and so
forth, I feel towards him something of the feeling that comes
over me when in a book of essays I read as the head-note to
one of them, "Lecture delivered at the three hundredth meet-
ing of the Mutual Improvement Association.'1 The essay
may be excellent, but, such is human, nature, I regard it with
suspicion, and it's ten to one I don't read it. So with the
recommended man. I shun him. Trust to your instinct in
these matters, and being what you are you won't go far wrong.
I go to Bracewells on Thursday to shoot at some of the
pheasants. There will be a few birds left for you to have a pop at
about Christinas time.
Ever your affectionate uncle, ROBERT ROUNDABOUT.

LETTERS OF MAEJORIE AND GLADYS.
II.—ABOUT ASTROLOGY AND THINGS OF THAT SORT.
DEAREST MAKJORIE,—I wonder how you can be surprised at
my liking for "trivial people," as you call them, after my unfor-
tunate experience of serious young men. Of ORIEL, the less
said the better; and I do not look back with much pleasure on my
engagement to ARTHUR, whose high principles, vile temper, and
determination to play Halma with me every evening drove me to
desperation and those practical jokes that led to our disunion.
However, you will own I am less frivolous, when I tell you I have
taken to believing in palmistry, combined with physiognomy,
table-turning, and even a touch of astrology. Mrs. VANDBLEUH
has a friend, a real Professor, who goes into a trance and reveals
the past for one guinea! Isn't it cheap? He also delineate«
one's character in the most wonderful way by a photograph.
You send it under a false name, in a disguised hand. I believe
one might even send somfone else's photograph, and he is so
clever that it makes no difference whatever. He told me that
the ear being placed on the side of the head is a sign of quick
temper, avarice, and a dislike to arithmetic. He never flatters.
Mrs. VANDBLEUR says he must be genuine, because he lives in
the Edgeware Road. He abo does crystal-gazing, and he told
Mrs. VANDELEUR when she went to see him, that he saw her in
the crystal in a dark-blue dress with a yellow front—the very
dress she was wearing at that moment! You may be sceptical,
but you must own that was a rather extraordinary coincidence!
You asked me for specimens of modern methods of flirting. A
rather good instance would be CECIL CAKINGTON and Mrs. VANDB-
r.Ki it. CECIL is the black-ribbon-watch-chain boy whom I used
to like, and she is a dear little woman who adores Mr. VANDE-
LBÜB. (I think, myself, Mr. VANDELBUK knows far too much
about stained-glass windows, and leta you know it.) She is much
amused at CECIL'S evident wish that she should have a hopeless
admiration for him. He is quite a child, and longs to have it
whispered—as loudly as possible, and on the housetops—that he
goes about compromising people, and breaking up happy homes,
«fee. The joke of it is that if Mrs. VANDBLBUB could take the
slightest interest in anyone except Mr. VANDELEUB (which she
couldn't), it would be someone who has lived and suffered, with
hair growing a little grey on the temples. A weary smile would
be essential.
CECIL is nineteen, and looks much younger. Here's a conver-
sation they had in the Park : —
Cecil (in hit earlier manner, not knowing what he means, but
intending to dazzle by a strong statement). I should like to burn
you, like spice, on the altar of a devoted friendship I
Mrs. Vandeleur (literal, fervent, and demure). It's very kind
of you, Mr. CABINGTON, especially as I know you only say so
out of politeness.
Cecil. Wouldn't that bo carrying good manners rather far?
Mrs. V. (smiles, and changes the subject. Pointing to me with
her parasol). There 's GLADYS LESLIE, m quite tight sleeves.
Cecil (as if apologetic). Yes. I suppose she doesn't know
they 're coming in again.
Mrs. V. How horrid of you! How nice and fresh she looks!
Cecil (seeking to ingratiate by disparagement of her friend). As
fresh as paint.
Mrs. V. Oh, Mr. CAJHNGTON ! you don't really mean
Cecil. Well, I should almost fancy she did make up the least
little bit in the world, if
Mrs. V. If what?
Cecil (speaking for effect and not from malice). If I didn't
know it for a fact.
Mrs. V. (slightly gratified). You know too much. You mustn't
talk of my friends like that.
Cecil. May I talk about you instead? I want to ask you a
great favour.
Mrs. V. Isn't that talking about yourself?
Cecil. It 's to ask if I may come and see you.
Mrs. V. I am at home on Thursdays.
Cecil. Then may I come all the other days P
Mrs. V. What, when I'm out? Is that quite polite?
Cecil (reproachfully). Is that quite kind?
IVirs. V. You may come on Sunday.
Cecil. Every Sunday?
Mrs. V. Every Sunday for a fortnight.
Cecil. And may the fortnight begin to-day?
Mrs. V. Certainly.
Cecil (in a low voice). And will you be surrounded by crowds
of people?
Mrs. V. Well, you haven't given me much time, but I'll do
my best by this afternoon. I '11 try to get up a juvenile party
for you.
* *****
Can you tell me what I ought to wear at a spiritualistic séance?
A low dress seems too much, and yet a hat seems somehow wrong.
Would green be a nice colour to wear to have your horoscope
cast in? I think a chiffon blouse—and perhaps tan gloves—not
white. Do advise me. It's at eight o'clock. With best love,
Ever your affectionate friend, GLADYS.
A FIRST-CLASS RAILWAY PASSENGER.—" General Sir ROBERT
BIDDULPH, K.C.B., G.C.M.G.," says the Daily News, "Governor
of Gibraltar, arrived at Plymouth, yesterday, on board the P.
and 0. steamer Caledonia, which arrived from Bombay, and came
on to London by train." What with motor-cars that stick in the
mud whilst the promoters empty the pockets of confiding specta-
tors; what with water-wheels that stop out all night; What with
the new Brighton railway that is neither boat nor railway car-
riage, we are coming to great things in locomotion. But this
performance of the Caledonia beats all. Fancy a vessel of 8,000
tons, just arrived from Bombay, quietly taking the train, going
on to London, probably dining at its club, and looking in at the
theatre afterwards! Sir THOMAS SUTHERLAND has worked
marvels since he took direction of P. and O. affairs, and this is
his latest.

No. III.—OF FOOBYDOM—OF YOUNO MEN AND OLD—OF тнв
MAKING OF FRIENDS.
MY DEAR JACK,—We were speaking of friends and friendship
when I broke off my last letter. Before I say any more about
this subject I wish to enter a protest. In your letter to me you
speak of one of your respected dons as "a regular old fogey."
Now, JACK, is this fair or kind. The gentleman whom you so
contemptuously describe was a freshman when I took my degree I
If he is ancient, what am IP If he is to have a mansion in the
dull realms of fogeydom, I, your uncle, must have a habitation
there. I teil you honestly I don't like to be relegated, even by
implication, to dust and obscurity. No doubt you will answer
that the Reverend Mr. BIFRONS is as bald as a coot, while your
uncle still uses a hard brush for the arrangement of his hyacinth-
ine locks, but I cannot allow you to escape so easily. I know
DICKT BIFRONS well, but when I think of him he appears to me
as a_lad with a head of tousled hair, a particularly pink com-
plexion, and not the slightest indication of a beard. I trust
he holds as pleasant a memory of me. Youth and age are
mere terms; they represent no absolute and invariable
realities. The oldest man I ever knew was Том SKINNER, a
freshman of my year. At eighteen he was a dried-up man of
the world, a withered compendium of depravity, for whom life
had no savour left. He posed as a terrible killer of ladies, and
hinted darkly that the domestic happiness of a certain married
Professor depended upon his reticence. None of us took him
seriously; his antics and affectations were food for endless chaff.
Once when, in pulling out his handkerchief, he dropped a photo-
graph on the floor, and made a great show of picking it up
hurriedly and hiding it away lest prying eyes should discover the
Hecret or his latest intrigue, we sprang upon him, wrenched his
treasure from him, and discovered a likeness of SKINNER himself,
taken in rap and gown, for the delectation of his family circle.
Somewhere in the provinces, I believe, he still lives on, a battered
for the young bloods of his district. If you asked me, on the
other hand, to name my youngest friend, I should point to dear
old LUOAS. Three years divide him from eighty; and in what
other man can you find so keen a zest in life, so hearty and fresh
an appreciation of all that is good and honourable and humorous
and friendly, so ardent a delight in
Youth and bloom and this delightful world.
His life has been passed in a constant and eager activity, yet he
is not wearied, and his laugh rings as full and true as that of
the youngest man amongst you.
And now as to your friends and the making of them. You
need not, of course, be over-genial or gushing as I have known
some men to be. But, on the other hand, I would not have you
to choose this man or to reject another aa a friend in a cold
spirit of calculation, because, after observing him carefully, you
judge him to be suitable or otherwise for the high privilege of
your friendship. I call this the commercial principle applied to
friendship, and for myself I never could endure it. Some
men, only a few, I am thankful to believe, adopt it and act on it,
but most of us would abhor the notion of treating pur hearts as
though they were ledgers, entering a man's qualities on a sort
of debtor and creditor account, and striking a balance for him,
as thus : —
Mr. HENRY BKOWN ш account with }. ROUNDABOUT.
Dr.
A loud laugh.
Untidy clothes.
Great devotion to books.
A provincial accent.
Cr.
Perfect amiability.
AVillingness to oblige.
Unselfishness.
A full blue for hammer-throwing.
Leaving a small balance of friendship for poor BROWN to draw
upon. You can't choose your friends as you do your tailor,
your gyp, the pattern of your clothes, or the style of your neck-
ties. If a man has the true qualities, and you are fortunate
enough to meet him, you cannot but choose to make him your
friend, and that without conscious effort on your part or his.
I am assuming that you, too, have the true qualities, but the
assumption is not a dangerous one, for, if I know you at all, I
know you are what a lad should be—manly, candid, honourable,
unselfish, not personally vain, and a hater of meanness. You
meet another youngster in a tub on the river, you exchange a
few words, he makes you laugh, you walk up together, something
in his manner and his looks attracts you, the sympathetic glow
begins and you exchange confidences. He comes from Winter-
house, you were a Charchester boy, you were both in your
respective football and cricket teams, you both think tubbing
dull—will he come to your rooms after hall and smoke a pipe?
Probably at the end of the day each of you will have acquired
a life-long friend. But neither of you thought about the pro-
cess. A man may be on the surface all that hoary moralists
approve—steady, sober, thrifty, and all that, but at heart he may
be a prig, a humbug, and a mean rascal. Your instinct will
keep you from him, however much elderly ignoramuses may
urge you to choose so steady a model for your friend. When
a man is urgently recommended to my affection, I care not by
whom, on the ground of his goodness, his sobriety, and so
forth, I feel towards him something of the feeling that comes
over me when in a book of essays I read as the head-note to
one of them, "Lecture delivered at the three hundredth meet-
ing of the Mutual Improvement Association.'1 The essay
may be excellent, but, such is human nature, I regard it with
suspicion, and it's ten to one I don't read it. So with the
recommended man. I shun him. Trust to your instinct in
these matters, and being what you are you won't go far wrong.
I go to Bracewells on Thursday to shoot at some of the
pheasants. There will be a few birds left for you to have a pop at
about Christmas time.
Ever your affectionate uncle, ROBERT ROUNDABOUT.

about stained-glass windows, and lets you know it.) She is much
amused at CECIL'S evident wish that she should have a hopeless
admiration for him. He is quite a child, and longs to have it
whispered—as loudly as possible, and on the housetops—that he
goes about compromising people, and breaking up happy homes,
лс. The joke of it is that if Mrs. VANDBLETTB could take the
slightest interest in anyone except Mr. VANDELEUR (which she
couldn't), it would be someone who has lived and suffered, with
hair growing a little grey on the temples. A weary smile would
be essential.
CECIL is nineteen, and looks much younger. Here 's a conver-
sation they had in the Park : —
Cecil (in hit earlier manner, not knowing what he means, but
intending to dazzle by a strong statement). I should like to burn
you, like spice, on the altar or a devoted friendship!
Mrs. Vandeleur (literal, fervent, and demure). It's very kind
of you, Mr. CAKINGTON, especially as I know you only say so
out of politeness.
Cecil. Wouldn't that be carrying good manners rather far?
Mrs. V. (smiks, and changes the subject. Pointing to me with
her parasol). There's GLADYS LESLIE, in quite tight sleeves.
Cecil (as if apologetic). Yes. I suppose she doesn't know
they "re coming in again.
Mrs. V. How horrid of you! How nice and fresh she looks 1
Cecil (seeking to ingratiate by disparagement of her friend). As
fresh as paint.
Mrs. V. Oh, Mr. CABINGTON ! you don't really mean
Cecil. Well, I should almost fancy she did make up the least
little bit in the world, if
Mrs. V. If what?
Cecil (speaking for effect and not from malice). If I didn't
know it for a fact.
Mrs. V. (slightly gratified). You know too much. You mustn't
talk of my friends like that.
Cecil. May I talk about you instead? I want to ask you a
great favour.
Mrs. V. Isn't that talking about yourself?
Cecil. It 's to ask if I may come and see you.
Mrs. V. I am at home on Thursdays.
Cecil. Then may I come all the other days?
Mrs. Г. What, when I'm out? Is that quite polite?
Cecil (reproachfully). Is that quite kind?
Mrs. V. You may come on Sunday.
Cecil. Every Sunday?
Mrs. V. Every Sunday for a fortnight.
Cecil. And may the fortnight begin to-day?
Mrs. V. Certainly.
Cecil (in a low voice). And will you be surrounded by crowds
of people P
Mrs. V. Well, you haven't giren me much time, but I '11 do
my best by this afternoon. I '11 try to get up a juvenile party
for you.
******
Can you tell me what I ought to wear at a spiritualistic séance?
A low dress seems too much, and yet a hat seems somehow wrong.
Would green be a nice colour to wear to have your horoscope
cast in? I think a chiffon blouse—and perhaps tan gloves—not
white. Do advise me. It 's at eight o'clock. With best love,
Ever your affectionate friend, GLADYS.
A FIBST-CLASS RAILWAY PASSENGER.—"General Sir ROBERT
BIDDULPH, K.C.B., G.C.M.G.," says the Daily News, "Governor
of Gibraltar, arrived at Plymouth, yesterday, on board the P.
and O. steamer Cakdonia, which arrived from Bombay, and came
on to London by train." What with motor-cars that stick in the
mud whilst the promoters empty the pockets of confiding specta-
tors; what with water-wheels that stop out all night; what with
the new Brighton railway that is neither boat nor railway car-
riage, we are coming to great things in locomotion. But this
performance of the Caledonia beats all. Fancy a vessel of 8,000
tons, just arrived from Bombay, quietly taking the train, going
on to London, probably dining at its club, andlooking in at the
theatre afterwards! Sir THOMAS SUTHERLAND has worked
marvels since he took direction of P. and O. affairs, and this is
bis latest.
History (as she is written).
.First Lady. Now what do you think started this Matabele war?
Second Lady. Well, I think it was the rinderpest.
Firsf Lady. Oh! is that the name of the Dutch Government?

MankUtow v. Jabberjee (ргг{ heard). Mr. Jabberjee finds cross-exami-

IT is now the second day of my celebrated case, which is such
a transcendental success that already the Court is tight as a

my utmost influence with the Hon'ble Judge that they were all
to be admitted.
But my solicitor, seizing me by the forearm, hurried me
through the entrance with the friendly recommendation that I
was not to be the ballyfool.
In the trough I perceive JESSIMINA seated, in a hat even more
resplendently becoming than her yesterday head-dress, and I am
not a little puffed with pride to be proceeded against by a plain-
tiff of such a stylish and elegant appearance.
10.25 A.M.—After all, WITHERINGTON, Q.C., has paid me the
marked compliment of turning up to personally conduct my cross-
examination. At which SMARTLE, Esq., becomes lugubrious,
averring that he is capable of turning my inside out in no time
unless I am preciously careful. But, knowing that such in-
human barbarities are not feasible in civilized regions, I enter the
box with а вегепе and smiling countenance. . . .
Later.—I am unspeakably delighted with the urbanity (on the
whole) with which I have been cross-examined. For, to my
wonderment, WITHERINGTON, Q.C., commenced with displaying
a respectful and sympathetic interest in my career, &c., which
rendered me completely at my ease, and though on occasions
he did suddenly manifest inquisitorial severity, I soon discovered
that his anger was merely histrionic, and that he was in secret
highly gratified by the nature of my replies. And for the most
part he had the great condescension to treat me with a kind
I had privately commissioned a shorthanded acquaintance of
mine with instructions to take down nothing but my answers,
but with inconceivable doltishness he has done the exact con-
verse, and transcribed merely the utterances of Mister WITHKH-
INOTON I However, as I do not accurately recall my responses, I
am to insert the report here pro tanto, trusting to the ingenuity
of the public to read between the lines.
HERE FOLLOWS тнк RKPORT.
Mr. Witherington, Q.C. Well, Mr. JABBERJEE, so it seems
that it is ail a mistake about your being a Prince, eh? ... .
And, however such an idea may have originated, «ou never repre-
sented yourself as a Rajah, or anything of the kind ? ... I was sure
you would say so. You have such a high regard for truth, and
such a deep sense of the obligation of an path, that you are in-
capable of a deliberate falsehood at any time—may I take that
for granted? .... Very glad to hear it. And of course, Mr.
JABBEKJEE, it was no fault of yours if people chose to assume,
from a certain magnificence in your appearance and way of living
and so on, that you must be of high rank in your own country?
.... But, though you don't set up to be a Prince, you are.
I believe, a recent acquisition to the honourable profession of
which we are both members? .... And also a journalist of
some distinction, are you not? .... Indeed? I congratulate
you—a highly respectable periodical. And no doubt the pro-
prietors have shown a proper appreciation of the value of your
services, in a pecuniary sense? .... Really? You are indeed
to be envied, Mr. JABBERJEE! Not many young barristers can
rely upon making such an income by their pen while they are
waiting for the briefs to come in. May I ask if you intend to
practice in this country? .... The Calcutta Bar, eh? Then
I suppose you can count upon influence out there? .... Your
father a Mooktear, is he? I 'm afraid I don't know what that
is exactly. ... A solicitor? Now I understand. So he will
give you cases—in which I am sure you will distinguish yourself.
But you '11 have to work hard, won't you ?....! thought so.
No more pig-sticking or tiger-shooting, eh? .... That 's a
drawback, isn't it? You 're passionately devoted to tiger-shoot-
ing, aren't you? Unless I 'm mistaken, you first won uie plain-
tiffs admiration by the vivid manner in which you described your
"moving accidents by flood and field "—another parrallel be-
tween you and OTHELLO, eh? Well, tell me, I'm no sportsman
myself—but it 's rather a thrilling moment, isn't it, when a tiger
is trying to climb up your elephant, and get inside the—what do
you call itr—howlah ?—oh. howdah, to be sure; thank you, very
much. ... So I should have imagined. Still, I suppose, when
you 're used to it, even that wouldn't shake your nerve to any
appreciable extent. You would bowl over your tiger at close quar-
ters without turning a hair, would you not ? ... Just so. A great
gift, presence of mind. And pig-sticking, now—isn't a boar rather
an awkward customer to tackle ?...." You never found him
so "? But suppose you miss him with your spear, and he charges
your horse? .... Ah, you 're a mighty hunter, Mr. JABBERJEE,
ïperceive! Ever shoot any elephants? .... No elephants r
That's a pleasure to come, then. Now, about your relations
with the plaintiff prior to your engagement—you were a good
deal in her company, weren't you? .... Well, you constantly
escorted her to various places of amusement, come? .... Yes,
yes; I am quite aware a chaperon was always present. We are
both agreed that my client has acted throughout with the most
scrupulous propriety—but you liked being in her society, didn't
you? .... Exactly so, and, at that time at all events, you
admired her extremely ?...." Merely as a friend;" eh? no
idea of proposing? Well, just tell us once more how it was you
came to engage yourself. . . . You were afraid your landlady
would summon a boarder and ask him to give you a kicking?
.... And the prospect of being kicked terrified you to such an
extent that you were willing to promise anything—is that your
story? .... But you are a man of iron nerve, you know,
you 've just been giving us a description of your performances in
the jungle. How did you come to be so alarmed by a boarder,
when the attack of the fiercest tiger or wild boar never made you
turn a hair? .... But that is what you gave us to understand
just now, wasn't it? .... Then do you tell his lordship and
the jury now that, as a matter of fact, you never shot a solitary
tiger or speared a single boar in your life? Wby didn't you say
so at once, Sir? . . . Do you consider a misrepresentation of that
kind a mere trifle? .... In spite of the tact that you have
solemnly sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing
but the truth? .... Very well. Sir, I will take your answer.
Now, just look at this letter of yours, dated June the 15th,
1896. (Your lordship has a copy of the correspondence. . . .
Yes, it is all admitted, my lord.) I'll read it to you.
(Htadf t'f.) Now, Sir, is it the fact that you ever actually
consulted the gentleman who enjoys the distinction of being
and facetious familiarity.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
tiff? Be careful what you aay And did he ever forbid
you to contract such an alliance? .... Then was there a word
of truth in all that? .... I thought as much. Let me read
you another letter. (He reads.) Here, you see, you make quite
another excuse. You are already married, and can only offer
the plaintiff the position of a rival wife, or "sateen," as you call
it. Have you ever contracted an infant marriage in India? . . .
Oh, that is true, is it? But why, when you were paying these
attentions to the plaintiff, did it never occur to you to mention
the fact that you were a married man? .... "You don't
know " P May it not have been because you were a widower?
Was your infant wife alive or dead when you wrote this letter?
.... Then why did you write of her as if she were alive? ...
I quite believe that—but why were you so anxious to break it
off just then? .... Well, when you were cross-examining the
plaintiff you asked her about a certain china ornament you had
given her, which seems to have been originally intended for
another young lady. We needn't mention her name here—but
you made her acquaintance some time after your engagement,
didn't you? .... And since you left Porticobello House, you
have seen a good deal of her, eh? .... You were a great ad-
mirer of hers, weren't you? .... I 'm not asking you whether
she is engaged to a Scotch gentleman at the present moment—
I 'm putting it to you that, at the time you were writing these
letters to the plaintiff, you had already formed the conclusion
that this other young lady was more deserving of the honour of
being the second Mrs JABBERJEE. ... I am not suggesting that
you could help it—but wasn't it so? . . . . Very well—that is
all I have to ask you, Mr. JABBERJEE. You can go.
I must not omit to record that my replies and the reading of
my letters did excite frequent and vociferous merriment, and in
other respecte I have testified so exhaustively that my solicitor

Only I regret that .1 KSSIMINA'S visage is now completely in-

"THE FINAL WAR."
(A Last Chapter, about as probable as its forerunners.)
So England, with the assistance of the United States, had
crushed the Triple Alliance. She had taken Paris, occupied Mos-
cow, and obtained the Treaty of Peace before Berlin. As already
described, the negotiations had been brought to a successful con-
clusion, thanks to the efforts of H.R.H. the Prince of W-L-S.
All was quiet in London—seemingly. But peace was only on
the surface. Amongst the millions there was a growing feeling
of unrest. "We are too powerful," said the foremost man of
Shoreditch. "Our prosperity is demoralising," added the most
influential inhabitant of Herne Bay. It was at this crisis that
Mr. ROBESPIERRE WASHINGTON WROT came to the front in a
leader published in his organ, Britannia's Adviser. Mr. ROBES-
PIERRE WASHINGTON WROT counselled disarmament. A Cabinet
Council was called, and the standing army (which had been con-
siderably augmented during the past war) was reduced from a
million and a half to five thousand.
Then Mr. ROBESPIERRE WASHINGTON WROT suggested that the
Colonies should receive their independence. Again a Cabinet Coun-
cil was called, with the same result. Then Mr. ROBESPIERRE WASH-
INGTON WROT advised the independence of India. Russia was
too impoverished by her recent defeat to take advantage of the
scheme, so the title of Empress was dropped, and things became
as they were a triple of centuries before. And now Mr. ROBES-
PIERRE WASHINGTON WBOT made a final suggestion: England
was to divest herself of everything to show her bona fides. No
sooner said than done.
But at this point there came a reaction. Someonepointed out
that matters bad been carried too far, and that WROT was a
traitor. Jingoism spread over the country like wild-fire. The
wonderful victories of "The Final War" became again realities,
and all was well.
So Britannia ruled the waves, as she ever can do when she is
assisted in the operation by a writer—on paper.

SONGS AND THEIR SINGERS. No. III.
CANINE SAGACITY.
DEAR SIR,—You will be interested to hear of the curious action
of a little dog belonging to a friend on the same staircase as
myself at Brazenface College, Oxford.
This animal regularly every morning, at the same hour, bnngs
a young kitten m its mouth, and drowns it in a tub of water
which always stands in one place. He is invariably accom-
panied by an old hen, who personally superintends the work
of destruction, cackling the whole time as if possessed, as she
probably is. The hen gravely stalks away when the drowning is
completed. To my certain knowledge, no lees than thirty-three
kittens have thus been destroyed on consecutive days.
Now, where does the dog obtain the kittens? Why does he
drown them? Is it the result of a solemn anti-feline vow? Is
it a vendetta? What is the connecting link with the old hen?
Does the hen employ the dog to kUl the kittens because cats
have injured her eggs or her feelings? I confess myself com-
pletely baffled! Yours ever, A. SOLOMON (Undergrad.).
Sott o Voce.
A WRITER in the Daily Telegraph has complained that loud
talkers at railway stations are too prone to discuss private
affairs in public, but surely the following style of conversation
is more aggravating'to bystanders on the same platform :—

LITHE and listen, gentlemen.

III name was ROBIN HOOD.
ROBIN stood in Sherwoode Forest,
And leaned him to a tree;
And by him stood stout LITTLE JOHN,
Both glum as glum could be.
"What bopteth it?" cried LITTLB JOHN ,
"The railway company
Is going to shriek and squeale and smoke
under t lie greenwood tree."
"Oh waly, waly I " cried ROBIN HOOD,
"Under the leaves green
Their sleepers and their rails they 'II lay,
Whereof will be great teen I
Merrie England will be no more,

And eke ye railway whyst It, I"
Forth then stert LITTLK JOHN,
Half in tray and teen;
• Let us hang ye Managere," he cried,
"Upon this oke-tree green!"
"Alas and waly !" cried ROBIN HOOD,
"That were a merrye plan,
But that, I doubt, would scarce seem good
To our Maid MARIAN.
She hath so many tronkes y-now
For farthingale and bonnet,
She will not fayle to greet ye rail
With glee, depend upon it 1
I trowe when arches roof ye brake,

And next she '11 get, or I '11 be shot,

Then uppe and blubbered poor LITTLE
JOHN
(For he, though brave, was human),
•' 'Tis never merry in the green wood,
Since MARIAN turned Newe Woman!"
Forth then went brave ROBIN HOOD,
With a most mournful cheere;
The tears out of his eyen ran,
And fell down by his 1ère.
"Gramercy!" cried he, "neath the green-
wood tree,
This hour Ц sure the sorest!
I ne'er did thinke to live to see

A SEASONABLE SUGGESTION.
DEAR MB. PUNCH,—About this time of
the year, it is customary for tea-dealers
and licensed victuallers to start "Qooee
Clubs," with the aid of the weekly sub-
scriptions of their customers. As a rule,
the Christmas bonue includes, besides the
succulent bird, several bottles of ardent
spirits, a pound of tea, and a quart of
champagne. Will you permit me to make
a suggestion. I would propose that a
company should be formed to supply the
public with a number of yule-tide hampers,
at the cost, say, of a guinea a-piece. For
that sum purchasers should obtain (1) a
pass to the continent enabling the voyager
tria. Germany, and Russia. (2) Coupons
for lint d accommodation (premier quality)
sufficient to last a month. (3) A tourist
outfit, with fur-lined overcoat. (4) Half a
dozen best whiskey. (5) Half a dozen best
brandy. (6) A travelling library, includ-
ing the works of DICKENS, THACKEBAT,
RUDYARD KIPLING, and WALTER BBSANT.
(7) An insurance ticket for £1,000. (8) A
concertina or a musical box (playing twelve
tunes) at choice. (9) A bicycle. (10) A
portable tent. (11) A conversation book
in four languages. And (12) lastly, a war-
rant of naturalisation available for every
country in the world outside the United

There, Sir, is the idea. The effect
would be that 'Airy and 'Arriet would be
lured away from their native land during
the festive season, and possibly be induced,
later on, to take up their residence perma-
nently away from home. Surely this

OUE BOOKING-OFEICE.
G. A. HENTY, of the marvellous pen, fights one of our great
battles over again At Agincourt, where "the one Jolly English-
man" knocked the bloom of the flower of French chivalry Kinto
a cocked hat," as our interested and very British schoolboy re-
marks. Especially as the hero had to encounter the "White
Hoods" of Paris. In his other book, the young naval adventurei
is launched with Cochrane Hie Dauntless on the troubled waters
of South American seas. Then there is The Loss of John
Humble, by G. NOBWAY, and it will be that boy's loss who does
not read it. Lastly cornes Violet Vereker's Vanity, in which
ANNIE E. ARMSTRONG (" more power to her elbow ! ") tells a
charming story of a girlish folly. All the above-mentioned are
to be found m the stores of BLACKIE & SON'S Book Cellars,
whose address must of course be sought in a Directory of
Darkest London. i
Horn Book Jingles. By Mrs. ARTHUR GASKIN. (Leadenhall
Press; SIMPKIN, MABSHAI.L & Co.) Another illustrated book for
smaller folk, though the idea of what our great-great-grand-
mother's Horn Book was might be a trifle beyond the grasp of
even our modern babies. Tnese dainty jingles may enlighten
them, for the nineteenth-century babies are generally well ad-
vanced, and the Horn Book should get on well if it can only
blow its own trumpet.
In Bohemia with Du Maurier enshrines Mr. FELIX MOSCHELKS'B
recollections of happy days spent in Belgium with our lost
"Kicky." It shows him, as in intimate company he was up to
the last, lighthearted, full of fun and good fellowship. It was
his early manner—this also preserved unto the last—of drawing
sketches at the head, tail, or on the margin of letters to his
friends. Mr. MoscHELES has preserved over three-score, which
are reproduced, and add greatly to the pleasure and interest of
the simple annals of student life in the fifties. Whilst Du
МАГНИИ was studying and larking at Malinos, there came a
time when, literally, я shadow fell upon his life. He had lost the
sight of one eye, and a cheerful doctor told him the other must
needs follow. It seemed the end of all his hopes and ambition.
But he boro the trial with unabated cheerfulness. "If one can't
paint," he said, "one must do something else—write perhaps,"
too much of Du MAURIER, and my Baronite finds in this volume
many pleasant echoes of a voice that is still.
In The Herb Moon (FISHER UNWIN), JOHN OLIVER HOBBRS'S
latest story-book, my Baronite finds all that cynical mood, rapid
insight into character, carefully-polished and sharply-barbed
sentences, that attracted him in early days to Some Emotions
and a Moral. Here, as there, plot is not the authoress' chief
stand-by. She tells again the old, old story, how two young
people love each other; how misunderstanding comes about, and
how they part. HP becomes a soldier. She might have married
—not a market-gardener, but a baronet. She resisted the temp-
tation, and he. coming back from the wars with the Victoria
Cross, marries her, retires from the army, goes into Parliament,
and "it is said will be in the next Cabinet "—a very happy
chance for a retired colonel, who, apparently, has not yet been
even a Junior Lord of the Treasury. But The Herb Moon is
avowedly a fantasia, and all things may happen under it. Mrs.
Harroby, who nearjy marries Rose to the Baronet, is an enter-
taining person, reminiscent of Ethel Newcome's protectress, Lady
Kew. The volume is enriched by a charming sketch of the
authoress.
Mr. Л MI n v STERRY'S Tale of the Thames, brought out by BLISS,
SANDS & Co. (what happiness in the name of this firm of pub-
lishers I Do not BLISS and SANDS suggest a series of, say,
Beatitude at Broadstairs, Merriment at Margate, and Capture
af Ramsgatef), will be found a charming companion by the
winter fireside, when it delights the gallant young watermen and
waterwomen to recall the adventures of their happy summertide
on the River Thames. Likewise will the book be invaluable as
an entertaining guide to water-parties who love to take their
pleasure "down Henley' way." Mr. STERRY knows the ropes
and how to work the lines. Take him as your guide, trust to
him to show you the river, and consider him as Mr. Ashby Steery.
The illustrations, by W. HATHERELL, are delightful. Pity they
could not have been, appropriately, in water colours.
Of prettily-got-up books, suitable to most times, and to Christ-
mas time in particular, JOHN LANE, the active brain of the
Bodley Head, produces not a few. Among his latest is The
Children, by ALICE MEYNELL. Its natural aimpHcity is its great
charm. All who are interested in children at Christmas time—and
who is not?—will have their pleasure enhanced bv reading this
he added, in a flash of unconscious prophecy. One cannot know
little book. TUB BARON.

HINTS FROM OUR IHVENTOR'S NOTE-BOOK.
THE INFANT-CARRIER. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR TWINS.
AUGUSTE EN ANGLETERRE.
A MARRIAGE.
DBAR MISTER,—During that I write the notes for my guide,
in visiting the englieh towns, I am alldays very content of to
have the occasion of to observe the manners and the habitudes
of your compatriots. I have spoken there is some time of и
"croquetparty "; at present I go to describe a marriage.
He goes without to say that, after to have received the in-
vitation, I expedite a little cadeau de посея, a little gift of
nuptials, to the charming mise. That it is precisely as in
France, and one cannot mistake himself. But I wanted, je
manquai, of to mistake myself otherwise.
Naturally I have the intention of to go to the church in black
habit and whito cravat, also as in France. For not to mistake
myself I ask to one of my friends, also invited, if one carries his
habit, his frac, at the church, and he responds that yes, one
carries his frac coat. Therefore I dress myself after the
dejeu»f.r, and I attend this friend, because I go with him to the
church. He arrives a little in delay, en retard, and the instant
that he perceives me he cries himself, "Bijove, my dear fellow,
did not I tell you that at a wedding one wears a frac coat?" "Eh,
well," I respond, "I have put my frac coat. Why have you not
done of same?" "You mean," says he, "you are going to put
on your frac coat? But you cannot wear it with an evening
waistcoat and a white tie." We say all this very quick, being
so pressed. "For why not?" I demand, "and also why are not
you ready?" "I am," responds he "Tieni! How that?
You wish to say that one goes to a marriage en redingote?" "In
a frac coat, of course." Then I comprehend that in english a
frac is a redingote, and also that I have not one instant to lose.
Aided by my friend, I throw my gibus, my frac, my white
cravat, my white glovee, and my other habits, I put a prey
cravat in marine knot, a redingote,, &c., I seize my hat high
form, we descend to the carriage, and as quick as possible we go
to the church, where we arrive much in delay.
The church is filled of world. Not only all the parents of the
charming fiancée, the female affianced one, and all the parents of
the тя1е affianced one, and all the inviteds, but also cf other
persons, some women, even some childs, who are entered for to
see the marriage. As in France, it is a spectacle for them.
By consequence we are obliged of to rest all at the end of the
nave, and I see not anything of the marriage. In effect the
women hold themselves unright all the time, and the childs are
at the fine, between the heads of my neighbours, I see to pass the
nuptial cortege—the new marrieds, the misses of honour, and the
witnesses. Then all the world precipitates himself in the street,
md after some time we find our carriage, and we go at, chez, the
mother of the young spouse.
There also much of world, for that which we call in France
"un fivoclock " or "un lunch de cinq heures." The new marrieds
receive in the saloon the felicitations of their friends, and me
also I give to each one a shake-hands, and I say, "All my feli-
citations." Then I am presented to some ones of the ladys and
to the charming misses of honour. And all the world goes to
see the beautiful gifts of nuptials, exposed in the hall of billiards.
As in France the friends have given enormously of théières, tea-
pots, of salières, salt-pots, and of bonbonnières, goodies-pots, but
there is much of objects of more great value, in jewellery and
in goldsmithery, as well as in. silvery, and also some cheques.
Ah, the charming chequee—not of Panama!
During all this time one can not to seat himself in any room,
at cause of the number of the assistante, and all simply also be-
cause he want«, il mangue, absolutely of chair. It is very
fatiguing. However, in fine the new marrieds go themselves
•iway to the station, and me also I can to part for to repose my-
self at the hotel, where I put my black habit and my white cra-
vat, without fear of to mistake myself this time here, for the
ball of the evening.
It is a ball of the most ravishings. Me I dance with the charm-
ing english misses just to the fine. That they are adorable! So
gay, so animated! And all the time that I speak they have
the air so amiable, so smiling, from the moment where I say,
''Will you accord me a valse, miss?" And I conduct of them
ч i nu-mu's to the buffet for to take a gazeous lemonade—ah no,
it is a squash of lemon!—or an ice, and more late all the world
goes to tho supper. Then we dance still; there is the Dance of
the Barn, and a dance all new, the "Washington's Post," very
droll in effect. At three of clock and half of the morning it is
finished, I give a shake-hands to the amiable hostess, and I
part with thousand thanks of her gracious hospitality.

AT NAZARETH HOUSE.
A very practical Christmas Carol.
GOD bless you, merry gentlemen! Does misery you dismay?
Remember Chanty, like Love, will always find a way.
And as the Christmastide draws nigh when Charity, at least,
Would bid the sufferer's soul rejoice, and let the poorest feast,
Let grateful thoughts of Nazareth, and all the boon and bliss
That name still brings to bruised hearts in so sad world as this,
Rouse you to service of your kind, the spirit's best response
To the Great Service done by One for all!
He who but once
Has passed the threshold of that door wide open unto nil
At Nazareth House at Hammersmith, is evermore the thrall
Of tender, loving memories. Spontaneous there hath sprung.
In service of the very old and of the very young,
Needs bitterest extremes, a spring of charity and love
As pure as inexhaustible. From sources high above
The dusty level of our diys such streams must ever flow;
But rains that fall on loftiest heights enrich the plains below.
And piety and passionate humanity combine
To perfect Charity's best work. Wouldst have such work bo
thin.',
Not in devoted hermitage, but as a quickening gleam
Amidst life's daily battle-task? Then help to swell that stream
Which freely flows for old and young, for every class and creed.
From Nazareth's nurturing ministry. Great ever is the need
Of rills auxiliar, for the wastes of London's life are wide;
Poverty's parching thirst is sore, sorrow on every side
Pleads mutely for compassionate aid that overtaxes still
The scant resource of Christian love, the coffers of goodwill
Help swell them! 'Tie a Christian task that brings a double
boon
To self and to the suffering poor. Send freely and send soon!
Go, see the sisterhood's good work, sick children taught to
smile.
And ol'l folk in safe hermitage. It shall be worth your while.
And leave sweet recollection. Nought will be rejected there.
The modest dole, the cast-off garb, the broken food, the prayer!
All who would mark at Christmnstide, love, grateful heart,
clad hope.
At Nazareth Home in Hammersmith shall find most fitting
even on the benches, all regarding the ceremony. However
scope.

Тик INFANT-CARRIER. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR TWINS.
AUGUSTE EN ANGLETERRE.
A MARRIAGE.
DEAR MISTER,—During that I write the notes for my guide,
in visiting the english towns, I am alldays very content of to
have the occasion of to observe the manners and the habitudes
of your compatriots. I have spoken there is some time of a
"croquetparty "; at present I go to describe a marriage.
He goes without to say that, after to have received the in-
vitation, I expedite a little cadeau de >!••••. a little gift of
nuptials, to the charming mise. That it is precisely as in
France, and one cannot mistake himself. But I wanted, je
manquai, of to mistake myself otherwise.
Naturally I have the intention of to go to the church in black
habit and whitu cravat, also as in France. For not to mistake
myself I ask to one of my friends, also invited, if one carries his
habit, his frac, at the church, and he responds that yes, one
carries his frac coat. Therefore I drese myself after the
dejeu»s.r, and I attend this friend, because I go with him to the
church. He arrives a little in delay, en retard, and the instant
that he perceives me he criée himself, "Bijove, my dear fellow,
did not I tell you that at a wedding one wears a frac coat?" "Eh,
well," I respond, "I have put my frac coat. Why have you not
done of same?" "You mean," says he, "you are going to put
on your frac coat? But you cannot wear it with an evening
waistcnat and a white tie." We say all this very quick, being
so pressed. "For why not? " I demand, "and also why are not
you ready?" "I am," responds he "Tient! How that?
You wish to say that one goes to a marriage en redingote?" "In
a frac coat, of course." Then I comprehend that in english a
/roc is a redingote, and also that I have not one instant to lose.
Aided by my friend, I throw my gibus, my frac, my white
cravat, my white gloves, and my other habits, I put a grey
cravat in marine knot, a redingote, Ac., I seize my hat high
form, we descend to the carriage, and as quick as possible we go
to the church, where we arrive much in delay.
The church is filled of world. Not only all the parents of the
charming fiancée, the female affianced one, and all the parente of
the male affianced one, and all the inviteds, but also of other
persons, some women, even some childs, who are entered for to
see the marriage. As in France, it is a spectacle for them.
By consequence we are obliged of to rest all at the end of the
nave, and I see not anything of the marriage. In effect the
women hold themselves unright all the time, and the childs are
at the fine, between the heads of my neighbours, I see to pass the
nuptial cortège—the new marrieds, the misses of honour, and the
witnesses. Then all the world precipitates himself in the street,
ind after some time we find our carriage, and we go at, chez, the
mother of the young spouse.
There also much of world, for that which we call in France
"un fivoclock " or "un lunch de cinq heures." The new marrieds
receive in the saloon the felicitations of their friends, and me
ilso I give to each one a shake-hands, and I say. "All my feli-
citations." Then I am presented to some ones of the ladys and
to the charming misses of honour. And all the world goes to
see the beautiful gifts of nuptials, exposed in the hall of billiards.
As in France the friends have given enormously of théières, tea-
pots, of salières, salt-pots, and of bonbonnières, goodies-pots, but
there is much of objects of more great value, in jewellery and
in goldsmithery, as well as in silvery, and also some cheques.
Ah, the charming chequee—not of Panama!
During all this time one can not to seat himself in any room,
at cause of the number of the assistante, and all simply also be-
eause he wants, il manque, absolutely of chair. It is very
fatiguing. However, in fine the new marrieds go themselves
away to the station, and me also I can to part for to repose my-
self at tho hotel, where I put my black habit and my white cra-
vat, without fear of to mistake myself this time here, for the
ball of the evening.
It is a ball of the most ravishings. Me I dance with the charm-
ing english misses just to the fine. That they are adorable! So
gay, so animated! And all the time that I speak they have
the air so amiable, so smiling, from the moment where I say,
11 Will you accord me a valse, miss?" And I conduct of them
someones to the buffet for to take a gazeous lemonade—ah no,
it is a squash of lemon!—or an ice, and more late all the world
goes to tho supper. Then we dance still; there is the Dance of
the Barn, and a dance all new, the "Washington's Post," very
droll in effect. At three of clock and half of the morning it is
finished, I give a shake-hands to the amiable hostess, and I
part with thousand thanks of her gracious hospitality.

AT NAZARETH HOUSE.
A very practical Christmas Carol.
GOD bless you, merry gentlemen! Does misery you dismay?
Remember Charity, like Love, will always find a way.
And as the Christmastide draws nigh when Charity, at least,
Wrould bid the sufferer's soul rejoice, and let the poorest feast,
Let grateful thoughts of Nazareth, and all the boon and bliss
That name still brings to bruised hearts in so sad world as this,
Rouse you to service of your kind, the spirit's best response
To the Great Service done by One for all!
He who but once
Has passed the threshold of that door wide open unto all
At Nazareth House at Hammersmith, is evermore the thrall
Of tender, loving memories. Spontaneous there hath sprung.
In service of the very old and of the very young,
Needs bitterest extremes, a spring of charity and love
As pure as inexhaustible. From sources high above
The dusty level of our days such streams must ever flow;
But rains that fall on loftiest heights enrich the plains below.
And piety and passionate humanity combine
To perfect Charity's best work. Wouldst have such work ho
thiib>,
Not in devoted hermitage, but as a quickening gleam
Amidst life's daily battle-task? Then help to swell that stream
Which freely flows for old and young, for every class and creed.

Of rills auxiliar, for the wastes of London's life are wide;

Pleads mutely for compassionate aid that overtaxes still
The scant resource of Christian love, the coffers of goodwill
Help swell them! 'Tie a Christian task that brings a double

To self and to the suffering poor. Send freely and send soon!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

HINTS FROM OUR INVENTOR'S NOTE-BOOK.
THE INFANT-CARRIER. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR TWINS.
AUGUSTE EN ANGLETERRE.
A MARIUAGE.
DEAR MISTER,—During that I write the notes for my guide,
in visiting the english towns, I am alldays very content, of to
hare the occasion of to observe the manners and the habitudes
of your compatriots. I have spoken there is some time of a
"croquetparty "; at present I go to describe a marriage.
He goes without to say that, after to have received the in-
vitation, I expedite a little cadeau de посел, a little gift of
nuptials, to the charming miss. That it is precisely as in
France, and one cannot mistake himself. But I wanted, jf
manquai, of to mistake myself otherwise.
Naturally I have the intention of to go to the church in black
habit and whito cravat, also as in France. For not to mistake
myself 1 ask to one of my friends, also invited, if one carries his
habit, his frac, at the church, and he responds that yes, one
carnee his frac coat. Therefore I dress myself after the
dejeu»f.r, and I attend this friend, because I go with him to the
church. He arrives a little in delay, en retard, and the instant
that he perceives me he criée himself, "Bijove, my dear fellow,
did not I tell you that at a wedding one wears a frac coat?" "Eh,
well," I respond, "I have put my frac coat. Why have you not
done of same?" "You mean," says he, "you are going to put
on your frac coat? But you cannot wear it with an evening
waistcoat and a white tie." We say all this very quick, being
so pressed. "For why not?" I demand, "and also why are not
you ready?" "I am," responds he "Tiens! How that?
You wish to say that one goes to a marriage en redingote?" "In
a frac coat, of course." Then I comprehend that in english a
frac is a redingnte, and also that I have not one instant to lose.
Aided by my friend, I throw my gibut, my frac, my white
cravat, my white gloves, and my other habits, I put a prey
cravat in marine knot, a redingote, Ac., I seize my hat high
form, we descend to the carriage, and as quick as possible we go
to the church, where we arrive much in delay.
The church is filled of world. Not only all the parents of the
charming fiancee, the female affianced one, and all the parents of
the male affianced one, and all the inviteds, but also of other
persons, some women, even some childs, who are entered for to
see the marriage. As in France, it is a spectacle for them.
By consequence we are obliged of to rest all at the end of the
nave, and I see not anything of the marriage. In effect the
women hold themselves unright all the time, and the childs are
at the fine, between the heads of my neighbours, I see to pass the
nuptial cortege—the new marrieds, the misses of honour, and the
witnesses. Then all the world precipitates himself in the street,
md after some time we find our carriage, and we go at, chez, the
mother of the young spouse.
There also much of world, for that which we call in France
"un fivoclock " or "un lunch de cinq heures." The new marrieds
receive in the saloon the felicitations of their friends, and me
also I give to each one a shake-hands, and I say, "All ray feli-
citations." Then I am presented to some ones of the ladys and
to the charming misses of honour. And all the world goes to
see the beautiful gifts of nuptials, exposed in the hall of billiards.
As in France the friends have given enormously of théières, tea-
pots, of salières, salt-pots, and of bonbonnières, goodies-pots, but
there is much of objects of more great value, in jewellery and
in goldsmithery, as well as in silvery» an(l а'8° some cheques.
Ah, the charming chequee—not of Panama!
During all this time one can not to seat himself in any room,
at cause of the number of the assistant«, and all simply also be-
cause he wants, il manque, absolutely of chair. It is very
fatiguing. However, in fine the new marrieds go themselves
away to the station, and me also I can to part for to repose my-
self at the hotel, where I put my black habit and my white cra-
vat, without fear of to mistake myself this time here, for the
ball of the evening.
It is a ball of the most ravishings. Me I dance with the charm-
ing english misses just to the fine. That they are adorable! So
gay, so animated! And all the time that I speak they have
the air so amiable, so smiling, from the moment where I say,
''Will you accord me a valse, miss?" And I conduct of them
someones to the buffet for to take a gazeous lemonade—ah no,
it is a squash of lemon!—or an ice, and more late all the world
goes to tho supper. Then we dance still; there is the Dance of
the Barn, and a dance all new, the "Washington's Post," very
droll in effect. At three of clock and half of the morning it is
finished, I give a shake-hands to the amiable hostess, and I
part with thousand thanks of her gracious hospitality.
Agree, &c., AUGUSTE.
AT NAZARETH HOUSE.
A very practical Christmas Carol.
GOD bless you, merry gentlemen! Does misery you dismay?
Remember Charity, like Love, will always find a way.
And as the Christmastide draws nigh when Charity, at least,
Would bid the sufferer's soul rejoice, and let the poorest feast,
Let grateful thoughts of Nazareth, and all the boon and bliss
That name still brings to bruised hearts in so sad world as this,
Rouse you to service of your kind, the spirit's best response
To the Great Service done by One for all!
He who but once
Has passed the threshold of that door wide open unto all
At Nazareth House at Hammersmith, is evermore the thrall
Of tender, loving memories. Spontaneous there hath sprung.
In service of the very old and of the very young,
Needs bitterest extremes, a spring of charity and love
As pure as inexhaustible. From sources high above
The dusty level of our days such streams must ever flow;
But rains that fall on loftiest heights enrich the plains below.
And piety and passionate humanity combine
To perfect Charity's best work. Wouldst have such work bo
thim>,
Not in devoted hermitage, but as a quickening gleam
Amidst life's daily battle-task? Then help to swell that stream
Which freely flows for old and young, for every class and creed.
From Nazareth's nurturing ministry. Great ever is the need
Of rills auxiliar, for the wastes of London's life are wide;
Poverty's parching thirst is sore, sorrow on every side
Pleads mutely for compassionate aid that overtaxes still
The scant resource of Christian love, the coffers of goodwill
Help swell them! 'Tie a Christian task that brings a double
boon
To self and to the suffering poor. Send freely and send soon!
Go, ire the sisterhood's good work, sick children taught to
smile.
And old folk in safe hermitage. It shall be worth your while.
And leave sweet recollection. Nought will be rejected there.
The modest dole, the cast-off garb, the broken food, the prayer!
All who would mark at Christmastide, love, grateful heart,
clad hope.
At Nazareth Hou-e in Hammersmith shall find most fitting
even on the benches, all regarding the ceremony. However
scope.

JOTTINGS AND TITTLINGS.
(Bv BABOO HUBBY BUNOSHO JABBEBJEE, B.A.)
No. XXXI.
MaiikleUna v. Jabberjee (continued]. The Defendant brings his Speech to
a somewhat unexpected conclusion, and Mr. Withcrinyton, Q.C.,
addresses the Jury in reply.
Мт aforesaid shorthanded acquaintance has very fortunately
preserved the literal transcript of my concluding oration, which

"Jabberjee'8 face gradually lengthens.'1
will afford a feeble idea of the grandiloquence of my loquacity.
—H. B. J.
VERBATIM REPOET (unofficial).
Baboo Jab. May it please your mighty honour and great notori-
ous gentlemen on the jury, it must present a strange and funny
appearance to behold a young Indian B.A., provided with a big
education and the locus standi of barrister-at-law, crawling
humbly towards your footstools as a suppliant, and already I per-
ceive from your benevolent and smirking visages that your hearts
are favourably inclined towards your unfortunate son, and that
you are too deeply imbrued with serpentine wisdom to be at
all bamfoozled by the ad captandum charms of feminine cajo-
leries. Indeed, I am a poor penniless chap, if not almost completely
dead for want of funds, and if I had only been able to call my
revered and fatherly benefactor, Hon'ble Sir CUMMERBUND, he
would infallibly have testified-
The Judge. As you did not think proper—no doubt for ex-
cellent reasons—to put Sir CHETWTND m the box when you could
have done so, Mr. JABBERJEE, I shall most certainly not allow you
to make any comments now upon the evidence he might or might
not have given.
Itnliiiii J. I beg to knuckle very submissively to your lord-
hearing my answers when I waa acting in the capacity of a
harrowed toad under my friend WITHEEINOTON'S cross-examina-
tion, very handsomely stated that I had left nothing for him to
say, and begged modestly that he might be excused. But indeed.
Misters, I occupy but a very beggarly apartment in this Fools'
Hotel of a world, and it is the moral impossibility for me to pay
any damages whatever! Moreover, it is a well-authenticated
fact that I am a shocking coward, and was induced to become
affianced by haunting apprehensions of receiving a succession of
severe kicks. For how, being suddenly put to my choice between
being barbarously kicked and punched or acquiring a spruce and
blooming bride, could 1 hesitate for a moment to accept the lesser
of two evils? Nevertheless, I did remain uninterruptedly
devoted to the plaintiff for many weeks—until I encountered a
still younger and more bewitching lady, who became the Polar
Star to my compass-like heart. But, lackadaisy, Sirs! though
I left no stones unturned to be off with my Old Love, I did not
get on very fortunately with the New. seeing that she preferred
an affluent young Scotch, whereby I am reduced to shedding
tears in silence and solicitude between two stools! (Roars of
laughter.) Mieters, like the frog that was being lapidated by
thoughtless juveniles, I reply :—P For you it may be facetious;
but to myself it is a devilishly serious affair!" For, after be-
holding the plaintiff here and discovering that she had advanced
rather than retrogaded in physical attractiveness, I made cordial
approaches to her, but she passed me by with a superciliously
exalted nose! Gentlemen, it is a terrific piece of humbug for
her to allege that her heart has been infernally lacerated by my
unfaithfulness, when, at this very moment, instead of lending her
ears to my brief and rambling oration, she is entirely engrossed
in flirtatious conduct with her curly-pated juvenile solicitor!
(Sensation.)
Witherington, Q.C. (rising). My lord, I really must protest.
There is absolutely no justification for the defendant's outrageous
insinuation. I am informed by Miss MANKLBTOW that she
simply asked the gentleman sitting next to her whether he had

The Judge. I fail to see, Mr. JABBERJEE, what advantage you
can hope to gain by these highJy irregular digressions. The
plaintiff is under my immediate observation, and I have seen
nothing in her conduct during the trial of which you have the
smallest right to complain.
Baboo J. I am highly satisfied by your lordship's obiter il.ctu.tn.
Not being in such a coign of vantage as your honour's excel-
lency, I was misled by the propinquity of heads viewed from the
rear. Now, before again becoming a sedentary, I am to propose
a decisive test of plaintiff's bona fides in desiring my insignifi-
cant self as a spouse. Herewith I bee humbly to have the
honour of renewing my formal proposal of marriage, and more-
over will pledge myself in most solemn and business-like style
never on any account, whether so permitted by laws of country
or vice versa, to take to myself a single additional native wife in
her lifetime. This handsome offer is genuine and without pre-
judice. (Great laughter, and some sensation in Court ал JABBER-
JEE sits down.)
Witherington, Q.C. Your lordship will see that this—ah—
rather unforeseen development renders it necessary that I should
ascertain the plaintiff's views before proceeding to reply. (The
Judge nods; breathless excitement in Court while the plaintiff's
solicitor carriet on an animated conversation with Mr. W. in
undertones.)
Witherington (rising once more). Gentlemen, I have, as it was
my duty to do, consulted the plaintiff respecting the unusual
course which the defendant has thought proper to take. Her
answer to his proposal is the answer which I am sure you will
feel is the only possible one in the circumstances. (JAB. beams.)
The plaintiff, gentlemen, has undergone the severest ordeal a
young woman of delicacy and refinement can be called upon to
endure ("Hear, ¡tear!" from JAB.), and out of that ordeal I
think you will all agree she has come absolutely unscathed.
I need hardly say that she is incapable now of harbouring any
unworthy sentiments of rancour or revenge. (JAB. beams more
ffulgently stul.)
But, gentlemen, there are some injuries which, as you know,
a woman may find herself able to excuse, to palliate, even to con-
done; but which she feels nevertheless operate as an insuperable
and impassable barrier between herself and the individual who
could be capable of them! (JAB.'s smile becomes a trifle less
assured.)
After the disgraceful and unmanly attempts the defendant haa
made to evade his obligations; his disingenuous defences; his
insulting innuendoes; after the deplorable exhibition he haa
made of himself in that box; and especially after the sombre
picture he himself has painted of the domestic future he has to
offer; after all this, I ask you, gentlemen, is it likely, ie it
ship's argument. The fact is, that the said Sir CUMMERBUND, on
possible, is it even conceivable that the plaintiff can retain any

(The learned Counsel then dealt exhaustively with various por-

not have to trouble you with many further remarks, but I will
just say this before I sit down:—The defendant, amongst in-
numerable other ingenious excuses, has pleaded for your indul-
gence on the score of poverty. He has the brazen effrontery to
plead poverty, forsooth! after complacently admitting, in that
box, that he is earning at this very moment an income by his pen
alone that might be envied by many a hardworking English
journalist! I do not say this by way of making any reflection
upon the defendant; on the contrary, gentlemen, I consider it
does credit to his ability and enterprise. (JAB. bows again.)
But at the same time it disposes effectually of his allegation that
he is without means, and indeed, leaving his literary gains en-
tirely out of the question, it must have been obvious from what
you have heard and seen of hie manner of living in this country
that he is amply provided with pecuniary resources. Bearing
this in mind, gentlemen. I ask you to mark your sense of his
heartless treatment of the plaintiff, and the mental and social
injury she has suffered on nis account, by awarding her sub-
stantial damages; not, I need scarcely say, in any spirit of vin-

IT was, indeed, a magnificent sight. The whole of the ship's
company were beat to quarters and waiting the signal for de-
parture. The fine old admiral stood on the modern equivalent
tor the quarter-deck, surrounded by the senior officers. He and
his captain, his navigating lieutenant, and a score of other sub-
ordinates. He had reason to glance proudly at the apology of a
mast from which gaily flew his pennant.
"My lads," he cried through a speaking-trumpet, "and under
this title I salute both bluejackets and redcoats, remember that
the eyes of the world are fixed upon you. And now, Sir, give
my favourite signal."
Upon this the well-known combination was run up, and the
fleet in general, and the crew of the Stupendous in particular,
were desired to recollect that "England expected every man to
do his duty." The familiar token provoked the customary
applause.
And now, my lads, one word more," continued the veteran
Admiral of the Fleet, still using his speaking-trumpet. "You see
before you the enemy—come to close quarters with him, grapple
with him and defeat him. Bear in mind that no commander can
go wrong who, without further direction from me, crushes his
nearest opponent. And now three cheers for Queen and country,
and away with ye."
The shouts were deafening, and then the men, responding to
the whistles of the boatswains, flew hither and_ thither in all

The old sailor used a stronger epithet than "strange," but
the word chosen must stand as a substitute. But for all the
cries of the admiral, the commands of his officers, and the activitj
of his crew the good ship made no progress. She rode the waves
like a painted snip upon a painted ocean.
Then there was a hurried consultation, and the junior cadet
was chosen by his seniors to give the required explanation.

tones, "it is not our fault.

The Judge. As you did not think proper—no doubt for ex-
cellent reasons—to put Sir CHETWYND in the box when you could
have done so, Mr. JABBERJKB, I shall most certainly not allow you
to make any comments now upon the evidence he might or might
not have given.
Baboo J. I beg to knuckle very submissively to your lord-
hearing my answers when I was acting in the capacity of a
harrowed toad under my friend WITHERINGTON'S cross-examina-
tion, very handsomely stated that I had left nothing for him to
say, and begged modestly that he might be excused. But indeed.
Misters, I occupy but a very beggarly apartment in this Fools
Hotel of a world, and it is the moral impossibility for me to pay
any damages whatever! Moreover, it is a well-authenticated
fact that Г am a shocking coward, and was induced to become
affianced by haunting apprehensions of receiving a succession of
severe kicks. For how, being suddenly put to my- choice between
being barbarously kicked and punched or acquinng a spruce and
blooming bride, could I hesitate for a moment to accept the lesser
of two evils? Nevertheless, I did remain uninterruptedly
devoted to the plaintiff for many weeks—until I encountered a
still younger and more bewitching lady, who became the Polar
Star to my compass-like heart. But, lackadaisy, Sirs! though
I left no stones unturned to be off with my Old Love, I did not
get on very fortunately with the New. seeing that she preferred
an affluent young Scotch, whereby I am reduced to shedding
tears in silence and solicitude between two stools! (Hoars of
laughter.) Misters, like the frog that was being lapidated by
thoughtless juveniles, I reply :—" For you it may be facetious;
but to myself it js a devilishly serious affair!" For. after be-
holding the plaintiff here and discovering that she had advanced
rather than retrogaded in physical attractiveness, I made cordial
approaches to her, but she passed me by with a superciliously
exalted nose! Gentlemen, it is a terrific piece of humbug for
her to allege that her heart has been infernally lacerated by my
unfaithfulness, when, at this very moment, instead of lending her
ears to my brief and rambling oration, she is entirely engrossed
in flirtatious conduct with her curly-pated juvenile solicitor!
(Sensation.)
Witherington, Q.C. (rising). My lord, I really must protest.
There is absolutely no justification for the defendant's outrageous
insinuation. I am informed by Miss MANKLBTOW that she
simply asked the gentleman sitting next to her whether he had
seen her smelling-salts!

(The learned Counsel then dealt exhaustively icith various por-
tions of the case, and concluded thus.) Well, gentlemen, I shall
not have to trouble you with many further remarks, but I will
j ust say this before I sit down :—The defendant, amongst in-
numerable other ingenious excuses, has pleaded for your indul-
gence on the score of poverty. He has the brazen effrontery to
plead poverty, forsooth! after complacently admitting, in that
box, that he is earning at this very moment an income-оу his pen
alone that might be envied by many a hardworking English
journalist! I do not say this by way of making any reflection
upon the defendant; on the contrary, gentlemen, I consider it
does credit to hie ability and enterprise. (JAB. bows again.)
But at the same time it disposes effectually of his allegation that
he is without means, and indeed, leaving his literary gains en-
tirely out of the question, it must have been obvious from what
you nave heard and seen of hie manner of living in this country
that he is amply provided with pecuniary resources. Bearing
this in mind, gentlemen, I ask you to mark your sense of his
heartless treatment of the plaintiff, and the mental and social
injury she has suffered on his account, by awarding her sub-
stantial damages; not, I need scarcely say, in any spirit of vin-
dictiveness, but as some compensation (however inadequate) for
nil she has gone through, and also as a warning to other ingratia-
ting but unprincipled Orientals that they cannot expect to trifle
with the artless affection of our generous, warmhearted English
maidens without paying—aye, and paying dearly, tool for the
amusement. (He sits down amidst applause.)

THE WAY THEY HAVE IN THE NAVY.
(fragment of a Navtical llomance à la, Charles Beresford.)
IT was, indeed, a magnificent sight. The whole of the ship's
company were beat to quarters and waiting the signal for de-
parture. The fine old admiral stood on the modern equivalent
tor the quarter-deck, surrounded by the senior officers. He and
his captain, his navigating lieutenant, and a score of other sub-
ordinates. He had reason to glance proudly at the apology of a
mast from which gaily flew his pennant.
"My lads," he cried through a speaking-trumpet, "and under
this title I salute both bluejackets and redcoats, remember that
the eyes of the world are fixed upon you. And now, Sir, give
my favourite signal."
Upon this the well-known combination was run _ up, and the
fleet in general, and the crew of the Stupendous in particular,
were desired to recollect that "England expected every man to
do his duty." The familiar token provolted the customary
applause.
'And now, my lads, one word more," continued the veteran
Admiral of the Fleet, still using his speaking-trumpet. "You see
before you the enemy—come to close quarters with him, grapple
with him and defeat him. Bear in mind that no commander can
go wrong who, without further direction from me, crushes his
nearest opponent. And now three cheers for Queen and country,
and away with ye."
The shouts were deafening^ and then the men, responding to
the whistles of the boatswains, flew hither and thither in aD

THE NEW HANSOM CAB-GIRL.
(A Suggestion for the Railway Companies.)
"In the name of NELSON," shouted the admiral, using an
invocation reserved for moments of the fiercest excitement,
"what is the meaning of this P Have I not commanded my be-
loved vessel to grapple with the enemy, and here she floats like
a log of wood on the restricted surface of a landlubber's water-
butt I What is the meaning of this strange inaction f"
The old sailor used a stronger epithet than "strange," but
the word chosen must stand as a substitute. But for all the
cries of the admiral, the commands of his officers, and the activity
of his crew the good ship made no progress. She rode the waves
like a painted snip upon a painted ocean.
Then there was a hurried consultation, and the junior cadet
was chosen by his seniors to give the required explanation.
"If you please, Sir," began the young gentleman, in faltering
tones, "it is not our fault."
"Not your fault!" thundered the admiral. "Here yon are
six hundred strong, and you can't move a foot I Not your fault
indeed! Why isn't it your fault, Sirrah P"
Then came the explanation, uttered in broken accents, by th<
trembling youngster.
"Because, Sir, in spite of all our men, we can't cause thi
engines to move. The fact is, Sir, we haven't got a stoker!"

We take the following extract from the "Dailii Chronicle1» re
port of a lecture on "The Life of an Old Irish Hero," delivere<

It must have been an exceptionally keen sense of honour.

DOUGLAS (my Baronite cannot away with WIOOIN) is at her very
best when she takes a child by either hand, or sits beaming
in their abundant company. Marm Lisa, her latest book,
published by GAY AND BIRD, is the story of a waif and stray, men-
tally, morally, and—not least important—physically warmed into
Ufe by sisterly hands. Lisa was the self-appointed guardian of
Twins, less Heavenly than any known in modern literature.
Atlantic and Pacific they were christened, and the combined
ocean space is scarcely sufficient to cover their iniquity. How
little Harm Lisa, "having all the sorrows and cares of maternity
with none of its compensating joys," tended these Satanic imps,
what pranks they played, and how finally she found rest, is a
story told by KATE DOUGLAS with that rare combination of
humour and pathos that is genius. THE BARON.

Marry, they say / spell RUIN; but, look you, 'tis but transposing the old
letters, and here is new matter: aye, and "matter most attractive," methinks;
how say you?
the thoughtful manager has certainly lost one point in not em-
phasising this by insisting on Mr. GBOROE HAWTKEY, as William,
making up so as to suggest the only WILLIAM who, in our time,
has been associated with '"Arden." By the way, Mr. HAW-
TREY'S William is very droll. Some great comedians have been
cast for these two parts of William and Audrey—the latter is
taken by Miss KATE PHILLIPS—and scored enormously.
Except in the wrestling scene, which is carried out with great
spirit, there is nothing for Mr. ALEXANDER as Ojiando to do; in
fact, as far as acting goes, it is a one-woman piece, and the one
woman is Rosalind. Miss JULIA NEILSON is most fascinating in
appearance, and exceptionally good in her singing, gaining a
double encore for the cuckoo song. When Orlando first sees
her in boy's attire, he is struck by her resemblance to Rosalind.
But had the real Rosalind been only so sparsely disguised about
the neck as is Miss NKJLSO.V when impersonating Ganymede,
Orlando could have had no doubt about the sex of the pretended
boy; and this criticism applies also to her hands.
The two best Rosalinds I remember wore high-necked doublets,
and buff, untanned, rough-looking gloves. Miss NBILSON'S fault
much less. Yet will her Rosalind remain in the minds of play-
goers as a pleasant memory. Mr. W. H. VEKNON is perfect
as ./<«;i«s, his only error being, in my humble judgment,
that ho looks too pleased with the song which he has
demanded only to sneer at it. A most artistic perform-
ance is that of Miss FAY DAVIS as Celia. The way in which
Mr. ,!.\MES FERNANDEZ, as the exiled duke, thoroughly enjoys
the propertv boar's head and real apples, furnished at the Arden
picnic, and liow he, in dumb show, his mouth being too full for
speaking, presses everybody to follow his example, is a lesson to
all histrionic beginners. The wicked brother Oliver, played by
Mr. H. B. IRVING, who repents, and falls in love with the Fay
(Davis) of the Forest, loses a chance of "good business "; for
when Rosalind, hearing of her lover's hurts, turns pale and faints,
there is close at hand a babbling brook of real water, which will
run as long as the piece does, and its proximity would at once
suggest that a handful of it gathered in a dock-leaf and sprinkled
over Rosalind's pallid brow, would help to restore her to con-
sciousness. But, strange to say, this idea never occurs to the
crafty Oliver, nor even to Celia, and certainly not to SHAKS-
PEARE, who had never contemplated the immediate proximity of
a running stream of real water on the stage where his forest of
Arden was located. Altogether a delightful evening's entertain-
ment, with quite an Elizabethan, Christmassy, finish of masque,
revel, and epilogue to send the audience away rejoicing.

DEAR. MISTER,—At Brighton, of who I have already spoken you
several times, one finds a great town, absolutely without com-
merce, absolutely occupied to receive the voyagers—town of
hotels, of pensions, of furnished houses, at little near, à peu près,
as Nice. And of more one finds at Brighton enormously of new
riches, of financiers, of lenders of money, often making display
of an ostentation and of a vulgarity absolutely insupportable, also
at Nice. Hasting, more sheltered and frequented by the olds
and by the ills, resembles to Menton. Eastburn, with her
gardens, her trees and her villas, resembles perhaps a little to
Cannée.
But Monte Carlo? Ah no I He wants absolutely in the
Sussexshire a town as Monte Carloi the town who is—as would
say some parisian journalists, writing the french language of a
fashion ignored of our great writers-;—" le féerique rendez-vous de
nos plus élégants mondains, la merveilleuse principauté de la Côte
d'Azur, où règne une délicieuse et printanière température." In
effect a site of the most beautifuls, and a temperature truly
springy, but a vulgar and pretentious little town, frequented by
a crowd still more vulgar and pretentious, a crowd of persons
the most "flashing," as one says in english. Very amusing to
see, without doubt, but not a terrestrial paradise, as pretend
those parisian journalists who are subventioned by the direction.
Naturally there is not of Monte Carlo in England, because the
game is there absolutely defended and absolutely unknown. In
some circles, or clubs, the English play to the "wist" for the
pieces of six pennys, and in the houses of the particulars, des
particuliers, without silver—"for love," as they say. But the
baccarat, the roulette, the thirty and forty, and the poker are
entirely unknown in your country, n'est-ce pasf You are so
serious, so correct, you play to the chesses, aux échecs, or, if you
desire a game more gay, more léger, you play to the ladies, aux
<lamcs. Eh well, the brave burgess of my country plays all the
days to the dominoes, that which is enough sad, I avow him I
It is curious that one finds not in the Sussexshire a town as
Monte Carlo, with a house of game. Would it be possible of to
establish a house of game—only for the english games, the " wist
for love," the chesses, and the ladies, well neard, bien entendu—
and of to have a " fairyish render-yourself of our most elegant
worlder»" on the english Coast of Azure? Figure to yourself,
Mister Punch, the gaiety, the vivacity, the intrain of a such
town I Figure to yourself the innocent gamers searching a party
of chesses, or walking themselves to the border of the sea after
to have played to the ladies I Voilà, see there, a true terrestrial
paradise, that all the world would praise, without subvention 1
And me, AUGUSTE, I have found her, this town so delicious!
She is at the border of the sea, not too much far from London,
at one half hour from Brighton, as Monte Carlo from Nice, and
enjoying of a climate soft and agreeable, and relatively springy.
I have visited her, at present all deserted, and I have peopled
her in imagination of the cosmopolitan crowds, and of the
elegant worlders, rendering themselves to the english Monte
Carlo. Among the innumerable new companies, of who the
announces fill your journals, it wants at present but this one,

But Monte Carlo? Ah no! He wants absolutely in the
Sussexshire a town as Monte Carlo, the town who is—as would
say some parisian journalists, writing the french language of a
fashion ignored of our great writers-^-" le féerique rendez-vous de
nos plus élégants mondains, la merveilleuse pjincipauté de la Cótt
d'Azur, ou rèffne une délicieuse et printamère température." In
effect a site of the most beautifuls, and a temperature truly
springy, but a vulgar and pretentious little town, frequented by
a crowd still more vulgar and pretentious, a crowd of persons
the most "flashing," as one says in english. Very amusing to
see, without doubt, but not a terrestrial paradise, as pretend
those parisian journalists who are subventioned by the direction.
Naturally there is not of Monte Carlo in England, because the
game is there absolutely defended and absolutely unknown. In
some circles, or clubs, the English play to the "wist" for the
pieces of six pennys, and in the houses of the particulars, des
particuliers, without silver—"for love," as they say. But the
baccarat, the roulette, the thirty and forty, and the poker are
entirely unknown in your country, n'est-ce pasf You are so
serious, so correct, you play to the chesses, aux échecs, or, if you
desire a game more gay, more léger, you play to the ladies, aux
dames. Eh well, the brave burgess of my country plays all the
days to the dominoes, that which is enough sad, I avow him!
It is curious that one finds not in the Sussexshire a town as
Monte Carlo, with a house of game. Would it be possible of to
establish a house of game—only for the english games, the " wist
for love," the chessee, and the ladies, well heard, bien entendu—
and of to have a "fairyish render-yourself of our most elegant
worlders" on the english Coast of Azure? Figure to yourself,
Mister Punch, the gaiety, the vivacity, the intrain of a such
town! Figure to yourself the innocent gamers searching a party
of chesses, or walking themselves to the border of the sea after
to have played to the ladies! Voilà, see there, a true terrestrial
paradise, that all the world would praise, without subvention I
And me, AUGUSTE, I have found her, this town so delicious!
She is at the border of the sea, not too much far from London,
at one half hour from Brighton, aa Monte Carlo from Nice, and
enjoying of a climate soft and agreeable, and relatively springy.
I have visited her, at present all deserted, and I have peopled
her in imagination of the cosmopolitan crowds, and of the
elegant wonders, rendering themselves to the english Monte
Carlo. Among the innumerable new companies, of who the

SIB,—Some little time since, the Spectator
published a letter purporting to be from a
iîalliol undergraduate, and recounting how
his fox-terrier has formed a friendship with
a Cochin-China hen und a kitten, which
belong to a man who keeps his terrier for
him out of college. The hen and the kit-
ten, according to the letter, walk down
with the terrier to the college every day,
saying good-bye to him at the porter's
lodge, where they are, of course, refused
admittance. The next number of the
Spectator contained an angry little notice
to the effect that the above letter was a
"forgery." They used to do these things
more artistically in Oxford some few years
ago. The legend runs that certain under-
grade., perceiving a clear demand for dog-
stories, and the ability of an esteemed con-
temporary to swallow statements which
might almost astonish even the Natural
History editor of the Field (if that be pos-
sible), determined, with the usual kindli-
ness and good nature of undergrade., to
satisfy the demand with an appropriate
.supply. They accordingly formed a select
little club which met once a week in a
member's rooms, the only condition of
membership being the production of an
"original" dog-story every week. The
stories were read at the weekly meeting,
and the one agreed to be the beet de-
spatched by its author to a friend in the
country to be posted. By this simple pro-
cess a series of the most amazing true
tales was given to the world, to the satis-

the great glorification of canine intelli-

No. IV.—OF THE GENERAL KNOWLEDGE OF UNDERGRADUATES—OF
THE SOCIETY OF YOUNO MEN, AND THE PBOPER EXPENDITURE
OF TEN POUNDS.
MY DEAR JACK,—I highly appreciate the honour you bestow
upon me when you refer to me for advice as to the best
manner of expending the £10 which you say you have just
received from your Aunt SARAH for the purchase of books.
She is your godmother, and in every respect an excellent lady,
and ehe still cherishes the memory of the learned and amiable
man who became her husband in the onlv interval which he
is known to have spared from his profound investigations into
the state of manners existing amongst the inhabitants of these
islands before the Roman invasion. In her innocent, widowed
retirement she doubtless imagines that the University of Cam-
bridge, of which you have recently become so distinguished a
member, is a home of calm and studious culture, where young
men spend their days in the laborious pursuit of knowledge
and the acquisition of all the intellectual graces. There—in her
mind's eye at least—they sit, each in his little monastic cell,
scantily furnished, save for its rich lining of varied books, and
scorn delights in order that somewhere in the coming yean
BBNTHAMS, the FARADAYS, the PITTS, the ERSKINBS of their age.
I know nothing in the world so attractive as a pure delusion.
May it please Heaven to keep your godmother constant in hers.
At any rate, I trust that her godson, whose library she has so
nobly desired to increase, has made a suitably grateful acknow-
ledgment of her kindness.
And now I am going to indulge myself in a growl. Your
good nature will pardon it, and if my views seem calculat^Îfto
offend you, pray ascribe them to the crusty prejudices and the
blindness engendered by advancing years. I shall stat« the
facts as they appear to me. You can treat them as fancies if
you like. Stated broadly, then, my first fact is that young
Englishmen, far from desiring to cultivate their minds, abhor
the very notion. They are barbarians—pleasant barbarians, 1
concede, but still barbarians. Some of them can turn out
Latin hexameters with accuracy, or Greek iambics both with
accuracy and accents; some are admirable in the higher mathe-
matics, others stain their fingers hideously yellow with chemicals,
or talk with an impassive calm of their gruesome experiences
in the dissecting room; others, again, employ their vast backs
in the "screwing of scrummages" (pardon a possible incorrect-
ness of phraseology), or in the propulsion of an eight-oared
boat, or, like swift CAMILLA, scour the plain, by which I mean
the cinder-path, in search of cups and renown. Each of these
estimable young fellows could talk for hours at a stretch on
they may step forth the HOOKERS, the BUTLERS, the MILLS, the'

his conversation, are summed up in the word " shop," and "shop"
is to a mind what the protecting stick, that is run through the
front of its little chair, is to a child. It saves a fall, but it
also impedes movement.
But take an assembly of some of these, the fine flower of the
University, and start—if you can—a conversation on some subject
of general interest, and I warrant no collection of ruminating
cows could appear more stolid. I remember once, in the presence
of some young men, making a remark about TITIAN, and being
brought up with a round turn by one of them with the observa-
tion that he didn't know much about "these old Roman Em-
peror Johnnies." This is typical, and if you mention a cha-
racter out of DICKENS, a book by SCOTT, by THACKERAY, by
GEORGF. Еыот, the title of an opera or the name of its composer,
anything or anybody in fact that a decently intelligent man
raucht be expected to know about (I make a possible exception
in favour of Mr. JORROCKS in the past, and Mr. ARTHUR ROBERTS
in the present), I '11 wager a modest competence that you will be
met by a blank stare of perfect ignorance. Heaven knows I
don't want youngsters to be prigs. I loathe a prig as the
Western American of a former day loathed Indians; but there
is a difference between the prig who uses his lack _ of total
ignorance as a bully might use his bludgeon—to prove his superi-
ority and to overawe his shrinking fellows, there is a difference,
I say, between this pert nuisance and the man who keeps his
mind open and his intelligence alert, who makes it his business
to know something not only about the great names and the
great deeds of the past, but also about what is going on around
him, the movemente, the enthusiasms, the art, the literature
of the world in which he lives. Such a man will be able to hold
his own in any company, and that, too, without abandoning the
modest reserve that should mark a youngster. Why, if a man
will only consent to read a pood review of politics, literature,
and the fine arts once a week he must learn something that will
enlarge his mind. In any case he '11 be better off than the clod
who confines his reading to the cricket averages and the League
matches, with an occasional and probably inaccurate excursus
into such humour as he can recollect from the back-numbers
of his favourite sporting paper. Don't mistake me, my dear
JACK. I don't propose that you should be a groaning mass of
encyclopaïdie knowledge—indeed, nature has, I fancy, guaran-
teed you against any such danger — but I should like you
something beyond the mere books that you must wade through
in order that at the end of your career at Cambridge the Vice-
Chancellor may place his hands upon your head and declare
you to be a Bachelor of Arte. Again, don't charge me with
wanting to make you a niminy-piminy dilettante with a soul
only for esthetics. You are going to be a rowing-man. Well
then row witji all your might, and talk about rowing to your
heart's content, about your chance of getting a place in this
or that boat, the latest theory of the sliding-seat, the proper
method of combining leg-work with body-swing, or the mar-
vellous deeds of some blue hero of the Cam. It is a noble exer-
cise, a grand school of the simple, manly virtues, and if, as I
hope, you are heartily interested in it, why you must and will
talk about it heartily. But every now and then you might let
your intelligence stray beyond these limits and refresh itself
at more enduring fountains.
And yet, and yet (I must sing my palinode) is there
anything in the world so pleasant, so stimulating as the
society of young men. One's old jokes and time-tried
stories, with what a full-souled appreciation are they greeted,
with what a zest does the company laugh—but that is nothing.
What attracts is the freshness of the youngsters, their enthusi-
asm, their hearty, honest love for what is of good repute, their
outspoken contempt for meanness in thought and action. They
have hearts — not the dried-up, leathery, dingy apologies
for hearts, that swing feebly in many a mature breast, but
lull hearts, beating sturdily—and they are not afraid of
showing that they have them. And oh, FRED, CHARLES, and
FRANK, friends of my early years, and yon, WALTER, REGGIE,
and DICK, you and others, younger friends of a later day, think
not that I have done you and yours a wrong in writing thus, but
reflect and tell me if, speaking of the mass, I have spoken in-
accurately, or with a wanton malice.
But there, my dear JACK, lyrical outburst« are very well in
their way, but as FRED and the rest of them will never see these
lines there is no use in prolonging this particular lyric. And
I find that I haven't said a word about the books you are to buy
with your dear aunt's £10. But your patience must be at an
end. I reserve the books for another letter.

Dreary Counsel (in the сонпе of an hour» oration). "GENTLEMEN, YOU CANNOT CLOSE
YOUR EYES—MY LORD CANNOT CLOSE ни—то THIS IMPORTANT FACT!"
DARBY JONES ON HORSE SALES WITH
VARIATIONS.
HONOURED SIR,—It cannot be said that
those Noblemen and Gentlemen who made
Newmarket the mart for the disposal of
their equine treasures were as a rule re-
warded Ъу high prices for their four-legged
wares. I suppose that the days are no
more when hundreds would fly about the
Ring with the ease and agility of a ball on
a lawn-tennis court. We need not beg the
God of Memory to carry us back to the
palmy era of the Marquis of HASTINGS and
the J)uke of HAMILTON in order to recall
some glorious instances of speculation in
that Horseflesh which I am given to under-
stand the Parisians prefer to Beefsteaks.
And how many of the high-priced Yearling
Darlings of the Hammer hare we not seen,
as Time wings on, disappear with forgotten
or dishonoured names, and vanish into that
Siberian Gloom which shrouds unfortunate
quadrupeds and unlucky bipeds alike? And
even the Winner of the Azure Ribbon of
the Turf may in his old age earn a precari-
ous livelihood between the shafts of a
"showful" or "growler," just as it would
not surprise me, in these Radical decades,
to come across a once proud Prime Minis-
ter dispensing cups of dubious Mocha in
the early morning at the top of St. Mar-
tin's Lane to vagrants who could not
muster up я Parliamentary Vote among
them.
Well, Sir, I am the owner of a Cat,
whose ancestors once sported in the Palaeo
of the Shah. His coat is as splendid as
the garment« of that Potentate, his voice
is as musical as that of the bard who
hymned Lalla Rookh, and his food is the
choicest meat procurable on a skewer. It
so happened that the long-time purveyor
of these viands recently disposed of his
business, and retired to a oretty marine
villa — after leaving a card begging his
customers to patronise his successor. It
so happened that I was looking out of
the window when this Ambulant Purveyor
called for the first time. Great Wbaird of
tho North! I knew him in a minute. It
was the Man who was to have been Pre-
mier at St. Stephen's and Conqueror at
Kpsom! This was his only connection
avoided harrowing the Past, and preserved
a strict Incognito, but Liberal Treatment
and Pints of Ale when he calls are and
ever shall be His.
But to return to my Southdowns or
Sales. I fancy that the indifferent barter
of Racers for Cash at Newmarket must not
be ascribed to want of either native prin-
cipal or interest. Uneasy moments in
the Realm of King BARNEY BARNATO, the
scattering of myriad Greenback» over
"Sound Money" across the whale pond,
the ceaseless victories of General WEYLEB
in the Isle of Partagas, the absence of
speculators from the Land of the _ Corn-
stalk and the Kangaroo, the closing of
Count LFHNDORFH'S purse strings, and,
may I add, the present sway of the all-
absorbing Bike and the Coming of the
Motor—nil combined to reduce the hopes
of the Soller to the desires of the Buyer.
Sir .1. B. MAPLE, M.P., has certainly
picked up one bargain from Blankney in
the daughter of the ever-illustrious Her-
mit. No one knows better, I take it, than
Sir J. B. the value of an Alarming Sacri-
fice. But without Foreigners or Colonials

HARRY'S OWN HOLIDAY LETTER.
DEAR PARIENTS,
I 'm happy to tell you (I am!
And "happiness" here is my own "real
jam,"
And not old AfcTFolliipum's annual treacle.
От mawkish molasses of clammy old
Creakle!)
That term's at an end! (Ah! and ain't
I just glad!)
My progress this half lias been—well,
not half bad,
Considering what an exacting old beast
MeWollupum is! (Oh! the wind's in the
East,
And our fire is gone out, and my fingen
are numb,
And I'm "joggled" by Juniper Minor
(my chum),
So please excuse blunders and blots !) I do
trust
You will deem I hare tried (And oh!
haven't I justf)
To do honour to you, and myself and the
school
Of MeWollupum, M.A. (Conceited old
fool!
He will stick the alfabet after his name!)
My average is top one (I mean at the
game
Of cricket, in batting; and as for the ball,
I have made all but Sloggerson Major
look small)
And if I 'm not top of my form, (which I
ain't,
Hut tenth,) I dp hope (though the hope's
precious faint)
To do better next term. (This one has
been a twister.
But Bolderson says that his beautiful
sister—
Oh, isn't she scrumptious?—declares that
my "form"
As bow in our boat is A •!.) It will warm
Your parential buzzums. (Oh well, scratch
that out!
Saps so fuss about spellin' and style!) But
no doubt
You will mark much improvement in—oh,
lots o' ways,
In your dutiful son, but you know that
self praise
Is no recomendation. (Should that have
two c's,
Or two m's? English spellin's a horrible
tease.
It 's just like, playing cricket without any
laws !)
Hope this weather will last, and that no
beastly thaws
Will bunniok up skating! (That word 's
from the Greek.

I need not scribble more, and this bother-

last
(If you must call it lasting, they do go so
fast!)
Till the fourteenth of Feb. when we boys
must resume
Our studies (wuss luck!). I feel quite in
a fume
To see your dear faces, and "Spot," the

And Mary, and mother's mince-pies. I

But oh! bother writing it. Good news

(A Christmas Letter—with reflections. )
DEAR NANCY, as in days of old,
I 'm sending you a Christmas-box—
If you will let me make so bold—
Containing French assorted "chocs."
All girls are fond of chocs, they say.
And sweets and such unwholesome
messes—
(How many boxes, in my day,
I've sent to—various addressee!)
"Sweets to the sweet"—you know the
rule;—
I think it 's been applied before
By me (and many another fool)
To you (and other girls galore).
Sweet tooth sweet temper, too, you know,
So don't be cross or supercilious,
Sweets never used to make you so,
Or anything but pleased. (Or bilious.)
So please accept my Christmas gift—
I think you will—for Auld Lang Syne!
(That dear old tag 1 It 's given a lift
To similar appeals of mine !)
For years our friendship we have nursed
(Love's dangerous pitfall lightly skirt-
ing),
And I am grateful. (NANCY first
Taught mo the gentle art of flirting.)
I Ve not forgotten yet—have you ?—
One .iolly Christmas at the Hall,
These old charades, the skating, too,
And Twelfth Night and the servants'
ball;
The holly wreaths—we made a pile,
I helped you with the decorations,
And pricked my fingers with a smile—
(And sotto voce objurgations).
Ah, well, since then we've had onr fling,
(Perhaps we've neither taken hurt),
But, NANCY, was it quite the thiîi<r
To accuse me now of being a flirt?
It may be so (it is, by Jove !)
But I confess, it raised my mettle
To hear i/o» say so! (On the stove
The pot likewise maligns the kettle.
Perhaps that 's better left unsaid—
I won't retort. !) Of course I know
You 're all that 's good, a model maid—

THE CONUNDEUM OF CORUNDUM.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—I read that corundum has been discovered
by Professor W. E. FEBRIBR in Canada! The Echo says:
"The value of corundum depends entirely on its abrasive power, and can
be easily determined by taking a piece of plate-glass, previously weighed,
placing on it a weighed portion of the sample to be tested, rubbing the mate-
rial on the glass until the glass ceases to lose in weight: the total loes of
weight gives the abrasive power of the sample."
Is "corundum" a new sort of whiskey P Anyway, I know
that an exceedingly interesting experiment of a similar nature
can be made with the common or Highland liquid and an
ordinary tumbler. Having filled the latter with the former, you
weigh t ho same, and then press your lips to the glass until the
glass ceases to lose in weight by the abrasion: the total loes of
weight gives the abrasive power of the sample as in the case of
corundum. This is an excellent Christmas and New Year amuse-

JOTTINGS AND TITTLINGS.
(BY BABOO H г к к v Виновно JABBKRJEE, В. А.)
No. XXXII.
Containing the conclusion of the whole matter, and (which many Readers will
receive in a spirit of chastened resignation) Mr. Jabberjee'sßnal farewell.
Queen's Jiench Court, No. • . 2 P.M.
HON'BLK JUSTICE HONEYOALL is now summing-up, in auch тег;
nice, chatty, confidential style that it is impossible to hear one
half of his observations, while the remainder i.s totally inaudible.
.... Nevertheless, I already gather that he regards the affair

with the restricted narrowmiuded view that it is simply the
question of damagea. ... He appears to be now discussing
whether my testimony that I am of such excessive natural funki-
ness as to be intimidated by a few threate into my matrimonial
engagement is humanly credible. ... I cannot at all compre-
hend why, at his frequent references to my alleged tiger-slaugh-
ters— which, with shrewd commonsense sapience, he seems to
jonsidsr mere ideally fabricated fibs and fanciful yarns—the
whole Court should be so convulsed with unmeaning merriment,
aor why so stern a Judge does not make any attempt to check
rach disorderly interruptions. ...
So far as my imperfect hearing can ascertain, he has been in-
rtructing the jury that they may utterly dismiss from their minds
ny highly ingenious plea of inability to offer any other kind of
natrimony than a polygamous union—surely, a very, very slip-
ihod off-hand method of disposing of such a nice sharp quillet
)f the Law! ... He is talking to them about my means, and
las thrown out a rather apt suggestion that I may have been led
>y sheer vaingloriousness and Oriental love of hyperbole into
ïxajigerating my resources. . . . However, he "sees no reason
;o doubt my competence to pay a reasonable amount of dam-
ices "—an opinion with which I am not so pleased. "If the jury
.hink me a gay sort of Hindoo deceiver, who has heartlessly
rifled with the affections of a simple, unsuspecting English girl,
hat will lead them to award substantial damages. If. on the
ither hand, they consider myself an inexperienced Oriental
gagement by an ambitious, artful young woman—why, that may
incline them to inflict a merely nominal penalty." (But why, I
should like to know, does a Judge, who is infinitely more capable
than a dozen doltish jurymen to express a decided opinion, thus
put on the double-faced mask of ambiguity, and run with the
hare and halloo with the hounds, like some Lukeworm from
Laodicea ?) . . . Now he is mentioning "certain circumstances,
which he is bound to tell the jury have made a strong impression
on his own mind." .... Alack, that, owing to the incorrigible
mumbling of his diction, I cannot succeed in ascertaining what
these said circumstances are! .... He has begun (I think) to
discourse concerning my latest offer of marriage in open Court.
What a pity that hon'ble judges should not study to acquire at
least ordinary proficiency in such a simple affair as Elocution 1
"It may strike you, gentlemen, that if the plaintiff had any
genuine affection for the defendant, or any actual intention of
linking her lot with his, she would "(the rest is a severe
mumble 1) "Or again, you may take into consideration"
(but precisely ц-Im t they are to take is, to myself, a dumb
show I). "Still, after making every possible allowance for the
idealising effects of the tender passion upon the female judgment.
I confess I find it a little difficult to persuade myself that -"
(Again I am not in at the finish—but, from the bristling and
tossing of JESSIMINA'S hat-plumes, I am in great hopes that it
contained something complimentary to myself.) .... He has
just concluded with the observation that, after what they have
seen and heard of the defendant during the proceedings, the
jury should find little difficulty in arriving at a fairly accurate
estimate of the loss which a young lady of British birth and
bringing-up would sustain by her failure to secure such a hus-
band."
From the last it is clear that his hon'ble lordship meant that,
in secret, he has the highest opinion of my merits, though he
entirely overlooked the obvious fact that he would have better
carried out his benevolent and patronising intentions towards
me by affecting (just now) to consider me only a worthless poor
chap. But even the most subtly-trained European intellects are
curiously backward in such elementary chicaneries t
3 Р.И.—The jury are assembling their heads. They seem gene-
rally agreed—except a couple of stout ones who are lolling back
and listening with mulish simpers. If I were certain that they were
fellow-colleagues from I'mn-li, I would encourage them by secret
signs to persevere—but who knows that they may not be parti-
sans of the plaintiff? If so, they deserve to be condignly punished
for such obstinate dullheadedness. . . . The foreman has asked
that they may retire, whereupon Justice H ONKYUALL answers them
"certainly," and retires hie own person contemporaneously. . . .
3.16 P.M.—The jury are still absentees. In reply to my ques-
tions, my solicitor says that, as far as he can see, the damages
can't be under £250, and may amount to a cold "Thou" (or
thousand) I Adding that, if I had only let him brief WITH кшм,-
TON, Q.C., I might have got off with £50, or even what is nominally
called a farthing. But I say to him, in such a case how could I
possibly have acquired any forensic distinction? To which he
has no reply ready.
3.30.—The jury are still delayed by the two stouts. I have

recently misunderstood the state of her daughter's heart, and
that she had in reality been ardently desirous from the first to
accept my offer. To which I replied that the gates of grave
were now hermetically closed, and that the plaintiff, like the
fabulous canine, had thrown away the meaty bone of a first-class
opportunity in exchange for the rather flimsy and shadowy form
oí a twenty-five pound note. But, aa a chivalrous, I refrained
from saying that I had been thua totally put off by an over-

SAYS our Critical Baroniteee, who has taken ia hand The
Flame, Flower, and oilier Stone», written and illustrated by
JAMES F. SVLLIVAN (J. M. DENT & Co.), " Its most amusing story
is the 'Lost Idea,' evidently suggested by a well-known §ong,
'Же always came Home to Tea.'"
Prince Boohoo and Little Smut», by HABBY JONES, is a
modern fanciful romance for children. Science has upset our
primitive fairies. Illustrations by GOBDON BBOWNK, who comes
out strong in the ever-fascinating story of Undine, published
by GABDNBB, DABTON & Co. Sintram and His Companion» is
another exotic from the forcing-house of the above-mentioned
Gardner.
Aforesaid Baronitess writes, "I had thought the morals of the
naval profession unimpeachable, until, in Fifty-Two Stories of
the lint oí/i Navy, edited by ALFBED MILES (HiiTcm\so.v & Co.),
I discovered that our maritime supremacy started with a ' d-mme,'
and ended, temporarily, at 'Trafalgar,' when 'Duty,' with a big
D, became the watchword of ' Victory.'"
The proverbial "two" used to be "company," but, nowadays,
it is considered more exclusive to have an odd number. Three
Girls in a Flat, by ETHEL F. HEDDLE, might be relatives of our
old friends Three Men in a Boat.
The Hose of Aliándole, by GOBDON STABLES, M.D., R.N.
(DiOBT, LONG. & Co.), starts with the startling assertion that
it is a sensational story of love and crime. Anticipation fully
realised for those who like the undiluted, gory romance. The
language is somewhat of the pure Adelphian Academic style,
which is a bit out of the author's usual line.
Butter Scotia; or, A Cheap Trip to Fairyland,.by His Honour
Judge EDWABD ABBOTT P ABBY. A sort of Fairy COOEE'B personally-
conducted tour, following a little in the steps of our dear old friend,
Alice in Wonderland. The only comparatively new acquaint-
ance is a golfing ogre. Fairyland has had to succumb to the
fatal fascination of the niblick and the putter. A giant of Butter-
Scotch extraction would hardly be complete without his clubs
and links. It is excellently illustrated by ABOHIB МлсОнкоои.
If offered the book, don't say, "Not for Nuts," but go to Nun's
(DAVID NUTT'S) and get it.
To those who love a laugh, and who, among the Baron's friends,
does not, whether at his own or somebody else's expense, latter
for choice, the Baron recommends Kemble's Coons, brought out
by JOHN LANK, of London. Most of the negro piccaninnies, and
the situations in which they are placed, are extremely droll. The

DEAB SIB,—I read with suppressed irritation the letter from
"A Thankful Parent," about the doings of his St. Bernard pup;
but when it came to the foolish epistle from Braeenface College,
I could stand it no longer!
However, my chief object in writing is to ask you to open your
columns to matters of proved scientific interest, such as "How to
be married, though happy," "What shall we do with our bores;"
Ac. At present I have good reason to be deeply interested in
occult science. When my Aunt MARIA died, just three years
ago, we had a remarkable premonition of the fatal event. The
housemaid was gently wiping with a soft cloth one of a pair of
valuable vases, when, without any warning whatsoever, it flew
into a thousand pieces. One month later, to the very hour, mi
Aunt Maria died!
Now, Sir, two days ago, the warning was repeated. The same
housemaid, with the same cloth, was dusting the remaining vase.
when, to use her own words, it "exploded," as its fellow had
done. The most serious issues are involved for myself and mj
two surviving aunts, and I should like to appeal to any student«
of the occult who may be able to enlighten me as to which of us
is this time indicated. My own impression is that it is Aunt
RACHEL, but she herself believe* that her nephew is meant, thai
is myself. You will see at once that a matter of this kind is ol
infinitely greater moment than the tricks of animals, howevei
wonderful they may appear upon superficial examination.
I am, Sir, Yours faithfully, COMMON SENSE.

THV. LOVES ОЪ1 THE HOLLY AND
MISTLETOE.
A HOLLY for several winters, when decked
iu Ina Um.->i array of ruddy berries, had
sent hi-, ши.-л tender regards by means ot
the iii.u-kumL-,, iiiis-Hil-uirusLr* and star-
lings iu HL' object of his love, a beauteous
JViiaUeiOo attached by torce of circuin-
ьишсе to a crabbed old Ribston l'ippui, oui
cue bird-messengers never brougnt iuni
any satisfactory reply, so the poor Holly
bitterly bewailed thai such a coy dependeiu
should be permitted to enslave his fancj
with the constant loveliness of her charms.
Aevertheless, he was persuaded that tía-
open and undisguised tashion in which in
waved kisses to her, whenever the winu
blew favourably, would sooner or later
result in some encouraging response.
Mean while the liibston .fippin regarded
him with such undisguised jealousy thai
one tine autumn he produced no more thai,
a couple of busheb oí sour fruit, and wat
promptly condemned ю death in the wintei
by the Diriman or common gardener,
boon afterwards the Holly was visited I)..
a chatterbox of a Tomtit, who said, "Mi&
Mistletoe is quite alive to your passion,
but she dares not return it through fear o<
uer foster-parent. You must therefort
take her bashf uiness at its true worth ant
hope on, for you have indeed a fail
chance." The Holly was so elated witi.
this news that he immediately préparée
himself for a grand Christmas display,
when he would rival a Highland soldier ii.
the grandeur of his scarlet and green garb.
At the ьате time he begged the Tomtit tc
convey the assurance of his undying de-
votion to the Mistletoe. No doubt hi.
message was duly delivered, for never hac
the Mistletoe shown such chap lets o.
snowy pearls. It was shortly after tin.
display of mutual feeling that little Tina,
the daughter of the Squire, accompanieo
her father round the gardens.
"Oh! how beautiful that Holly and that
Mistletoe look," she exclaimed. "W€
must have them joined together for Christ-
mas, eh, daddy ï"
The Squire readily assented, and gave
the necessary instructions to the head ol
his horticultural department. "I'm glad
of that, Sir," said the Dirtman, "because
that there 'oily spoils the laurels, and at
to the Mistletoe, I believe it's killed the
apple-tree." The Holly felt a contempt
for the gardener which he could not ex-
press. But the bitterness of his reflection
was, however, effaced by his joy. At last
Miss Mistletoe was to be united with him-
self! He looked forward to Christmas-
tide with all expectancy. He winced a
little, it is true, when the Dirtman camr
with an axe and chopped his trunk in twain,
but oh! what rapture when he was hung
at last, intermingled with his beloved Mis-
tletoe, in the centre of the great hall.
"Darling," he whispered to his bride,
"at last we are one!
"Yes," she murmured, "how thankful
I am! Look at that horrid Ribston
Pippin glaring at us from the fireplace!"
They were so happy for nearly a fort-
night. Little Tina and ter friends, es-
pecially one friend, who was familiar, came
and made merry beneath their branches.
"This is seeing life," said the Holly, as he
wrapped the Mistletoe in his strong em-
brace. "Yes," she replied, " but life is the
beginning of death." She was right, for,
on Twelfth Night, the varlets and maids
came and stripped down all the leafy
ashes of the Pippin's trunk. But the
Holly and the Mistletoe were not divided.
They flew up the chimney side by side, as a
couple of sparks, right into the heaven
above. That same night the Astronomer-
Royal reported two new stars in the firma-
ment. He gave them names such as
would probably crush the understanding
of an ordinary Board School teacher, but
all children of Earth, no matter what their
age, who read these lines, will know them
as Holly and Mistletoe, the Ever Constant.
