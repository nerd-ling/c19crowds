VER!" cried Mr. Punch, removing his sailor cap and mopping his manly brow, moist with sea-spray, and the
perspiration produced by many Jubilee toasts and much loyal shouting.
"Fancy you 're playing umpire at a new game of vaval cricket?” queried NEPTUNE, with a nautical wink.
“Nay, Nep," answered the smiling Sage. “I'm universal umpire at all known games, from croquet to the kriegs.
spiel. But cricket on your green sea-fields, old tarry-breeks, has got to be invented. I merely meant that the great Naval
Review of June, 1897, is 'over.'”
“Humph!" muttered NEPTUNE. “Your Armstrongs -aptest of names !-might provide excellent ball-practice for
an Eleven of Titans, captained by a HYPERION-GRACE, with an OCEANUS-RICHARDSON for chief trundler."
“That would be a novel Titanomachia, mustered to make a British Bank Holiday !” responded Mr. Punch. “But
the one we have seen to-day, though our armour-clad Titans have only been like Leviathans at play, or Cyclops in rehearsal,
hath been splendid, preguant with immense possibilities, and calculated to astonish the Hecatoncheires themselves."
“ Verily,” said NEPTUNE, “ the hundred-handed warders of the vanquished Titans never witnessed such wonders as
the Diamond Jubilee Naval Review, of which we have just been sympathetic and adıniring spectators. My own favourite
modern Titanide, BRITANNIA, has bettered her instructions, and beaten her ancient prototypes, THIA, THEMIS, and TETHY,
hollow."
“Ah, here is the greatest of the modern Uranide !" said Mr. Pusch, warned by the barking of that genuine sea-dog,
TOBIAS, of the approach of BRITANNIA herself, in her strong, deftly-fashioned steel armour, but unhelmed for coolness' sake
and ease, like Britomart after battle. Mr. Punch pertinently quoted the patrio:-poet, SPENSER :-
“Like as Bellona (being late returnd
From slaughter of the giaunts conqueréd ;
Where proud Encelade, whose wide nosthrils burnd
With breathed flames like to a furnace redd,
Transfixed with her speare downe tombled dedd
From top of Hemus by him heaped hye ;)
Hath loosd her helmet from her lofty hedd,
And her Gorgonian shield gins to untye
From her lefte arme, to rest in glorious victorye.”
“ Thanks, Mr. Punch, for the complimentary and poetic comparison !" said the war-mail'd and day-weary nymph,
taking her seat at NEPTUNE's side.“ Huve you, from your inexhaustible store, no apt extract for Father Nep himself ? "

(JULY 3, 1897.
Mr. Punch, the omniscient, responded promptly :-
“Next unto her was Neptune pictured
Which foure great hippodames did draw in teem-wise tyde,
In his divine resemblance wondrous lyke :
His sea-horses did seeme to snort amayne
His face was rugged, and his hoarie hed
And from their nosethrilles blow the brynie streame.
Dropped with brackish dew; his threeforkt pyke
He stearnly shooke. *
For privy love his brest empiercéd had.
That his swift charet might have passage wyde,
Ne ought but deare BRITANNIA now could make him glad."
The brown-faced, brine-soaked sailor-god laughed loud and long, and Britannia blushed smilingly, or smiled blush-
ingly, which soever way it may be put. “By the blue-green eyes of Amphitrite,” he cried, “ BRITANNIA has made him
glad' this day, as he has not often been since that day of days at Trafalgar.”
“A mere playful parade of my naval power in honour of dear VICTORIA's sixty years of benignant sway, O salt-
bearded Sire of mine," replied BRITANNIA, with a curious double-edged smile.
"Titans who can play ' like that, my shrewd daughter, will give a good account of their steel thews and thunder-
throated missiles, when the time for serious tussle comes,” said NEPTUNE, grimly.
“I trust so," responded BRITANNIA, looking with pensive pride out seaward, where her miles of ranked and ranged
warships were yet visible. “But, Toby, I am athirst !”
TOBIAS, rigged for the great occasion in natty nautical gear, handed round the hospitable Sage's Jubilee jorum,
wherein Father NEPTUNE's bearded lip and BRITANNIA's sweet firm mouth were alike ready to dip.
“ A toast ! a toast !" cried Mr. Punch, lifting high his brimming beaker.
“ Here's to VICTORIA, honoured and dear!
And here's to OUR FLEET, in this Diamond Year,
Many happy returns of this Jubilee Year!
And the brave lads who man it and never know fear!
Here's to BRITANNIA, the gentle and brave,
Hearts of oak are they still, though their ships are of iron.
And long may her banner float free o'er the wave!
Whilst such ships and sea-dogs our white cliffs environ,
Here's to old NEPTUNE, and long may he smile
Our QUEEN is at rest, and our homes are at ease!
On the daughter he loves, and his favourite Isle !
Hooray! Let this Toast, lads, sound loud o'er the seas !! "
“ Capital !" cried NEPTUSE. “But I 'll veuture to add just one couplet ;-
“ VICTORIA, BRITANNIA, old NEPTUNE! Brave bunch!
But, to make all things square, add sage-patriot Punch!!"
“Hear! hear!” cried BRITANNIA. “Bow-wow!" yapped Toby.
“ Thanks!" responded Punch, feelingly, looking like Erin, “ with a smile on his lip and a tear in his eye." “ In
return let me present you with BRITANNIA's Beacon, the Patriot's Pilot, Queen VICTORIA's mo-t valued Vade Mecum, the true
British Mariner's Compass, and Father NEPTUNE's Friend and Fun-provider. Toby, hand 'em my

Oh, for painter's fairy palette or the sculptor's magic mallet

'Neath her silky drooping lashes there "s a hazel eye that flashes
Where the sunshine seems to sparkle through the rain;
For the Farmer's winsome daughter is a gem of purest water,
And the countryside is proud of pretty JANE.
It is striking, very striking, what a number have a liking
For the Farmer, and come tramping down the lane;
For the road is long and dusty, and the Fanner's somewhat
crusty,
And has nothing of the charm of pretty JANE.
Nay, the gouty red-faced Majors, and the oldest of old-stagers,
Hobble all the weary way and back again,
And they do not grudge the trouble, and they would not, were it
double,
Just to catch a passing glimpse of pretty JANE.
For 'tis better far than nipping in the Club, to see her tripping
Through the farmyard, singing softly some refrain,
While the purring Tom, resplendent in a ribbon, trots attendant,
Tail erected, at the heels of pretty JANE.
And the pigeons leare the gables and the thatch upon the stables,
Where they love to circle round the creaking vane,
Till the foremost, growing bolder, will alight upon her shoulder,
Cooing gently as he nestles up to JANE.
And the hens come hurry-scurry, with their foolish noisy flurry,
Like a lot of women running for a train,
While the bantam, crowing loudly, flaps his little pinions proudly
As he struts along in front of pretty JANE.
And the clumsy ducks come waddling from the pool where
they "ve been paddling
'Mid the water-weeds, and eagerly they crane,
As they troop in order single up the shelving bank of shingle,
When they hear the silver voice of pretty JANE.
So she moves about her duties like a queen of rustic beauties,
Till the youngsters, one would think, were all insane,
For they take to writing sonnets to the lavender sun-bonnets,
And the eyebrows, and the lips of pretty JANE.
And the Majors homeward toddle with their gouty little waddle,
Fondly dreaming they are young too once again,
And they wish it had been given them to find the way to heaven,
For they 're sadly loth to part from pretty JANE.

BET ONE FOR MYSELF. WlLL YOU HAVE A MACAROON AND SOME
GlNOER-POP?"
ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
(Letters from Mr. R. to his Nephew at Cambridge, and to Others.)
No. V.—ADVICE AS TO CHOICE OF BOOKS.
MY DEAR JACK,—I wonder if you still possess the £10 pre-
sented to you by your aunt for the purchase of books. Heaven
forbid that I should make any imputations on your perfect moral
rectitude; but I know that the youngsters of my own day
entertained a dislike amounting almost to loathing for what I
may term the conservation of money. No flight of swallows
speeding Southward ever went more swiftly than, did the shil-
lings, the half-crown, and the sovereigns of those cheerful under-
graduates. They scattered a bimetallic shower with generous
hands over the town of Cambridge and its surrounding districts,
and for a time lived at the rate of £10.000 on an allowance of not
more than £300. A gift of £10 for books would have been re-
ceived with delight, but while the question of how to stock a
library was still debating, I warrant the £10 would have fled away
into the Ewigkeii of HANS BREITMANN'S party. Then in a burst
of remorse the books would have been purchased, and the unpaid
bill for them would doubtless have been included in the parcel
eventually submitted to a stern father for payment at the end
of our young friend's University career. That sounds horribly
dishonest, and so, indeed, it is, if you consider it with a proper
strictness. But this youthful thoughtlessness never considered
anything with strictness, and the result was the misery to which
ifr. M.icawl>er was so frequent and so gloomy a victim. But the
lesson learnt was not without its value, and I am bound to add
that nearly all the gay young squanderers with whom I have kept
in touch have settled down into the most complete financial
rectitude and the most perfect general respectability after their
bitter experience of pecuniary disaster at the University. Many
of them, as I know, thread the mazes of commerce with skill,
and battle, non sine, gloria, on the Stock Exchange and in banks;
nor does anyone venture to cast a slur upon their fair fame or
their mercantile credit. This is not to say that you are to be a
squanderer. Read 1'endennis, and say if you are anxious to
go through Pen's bitter experience. Of what avail to him was
his reputation as a wit and a giver of dinners, how did it profit
him that he was magnificently arrayed in clothes of beautiful
cut, that his person sparkled with jewels when the duna were
hammering at nis oak, and the ruthless plough of the examiners
had passed over him? No; keep away from extravagance; live
decently and moderately, enjoy your happy youth and try to be
both modest and manly, not merely in your general bearing, but
more particularly in the control of your finances. This advice
is probably useless to you, for I understand that the young men
of the present day are careful and methodical, that they keep
regular accounts, and live strictly within their incomes. This
information, to the strict accuracy of which I do not pledge
myself, came to me from a maternal source, in point of fact
from Mrs. HORNBLOWER, whose two sons are, I am told, models
of propriety and regulated behaviour in the sister University
of Oxford. You know these two young men. Pray, pray re-
lieve my mind by assuring me that the ADOLPHUS HOHNBLOWER
who quite lately lit a bonfire in his College quadrangle, and after-
wards painted a don's door vermilion (I heard of the escapade by
the merest chance) was not one of these patterns of the cardinal
virtues?
And now to be brief with you as to these books. Buy, in the
first place, books that deal with noble actions. NAPIER'S history
of the war in the Peninsula is such a book, stately, dignified, and
ringing throughout with the true heroic ring. \V ho can read it
without a stir of the pulses and a heightened colour as the magni-
ficent pageant of British endurance and valour passes before nis
eyes. Then, lest you should think that Britons only are cour-
ageous and strong, take such a book as the Memoirs of Baron
Marbot (they are admirably translated by Mr. BUTLER), and learn
from his story of the Battle of Eylau how Frenchmen could fight
and suffer and die for their Emperor and their country. Those
were the great days, and the figures that trod the stage of life
were mighty; but I think, should the need arise, that the men
of our own time would answer to the call and bear themselves
not less worthily. This soldier, MARBOT, was a fighter from his
youth up. He never played football, or ran a three-mile race,
or helped to make a bump. Yet he could march, and bear
Fatigue, and ride long-distance rides with despatches, and fight
liiiml to hand like any Paladin. Courage and great deeds are
the private possession of no particular age and country. We
bave no private patent for them, though to hear some of us talk
you might think we had. But this subject grows in the writing.
I must revert to it on another occasion 2 your patience and
your money can last for a few days.
Good-bye, my dear boy, Your affectionate uncle, BOB.
THE NEW COINAGE.
OUR change is changed: the penny of futurity
Portrays Britannia seated on the shore
Ruling the waves in prudence, peace and purity,
As Heretofore.
But banished are the lighthouse and the galleon,
Which formed the old supporters of the seal;
And now she sits upon the large medallion
(So like a wheel)
Alone, alas I and cold as any icicle.
But, in this land of bye-laws, is it right
Britannia's self should ride upon a bicycle
Without a light?
BLACK CARE BEHIND THE AUTO-HORSEMAN.
THE villagers were wild with terror. Every cottage was closed,
and the frightened occupants were huddled together in corners,
Fearful of the least sound that disturbed the awe-stricken silence.
Then there was the sound of hissing, as if a score of serpents
were in pursuit of some hunted rabbit. The sibilation, which
grew louder and louder, was followed by the whirl of wheels,
and the faint perfume of petroleum crept into the village streets.
The noise increased in volume. And now was heard loud
exclamations of anger and despair. "Take care of the pump 1"
cried one. "Don't upset the stocks!" yelled another. "Keep
io the right 1" "Keep to the left!" Babel seemed to have broken
loose for a moment, and then the whirring of the wheels and the
hissing of the serpents decreased and died away.
"Hurrah!" the shout came from every throat. Shutters
disappeared in a twinkling, doors were opened in a trice, and the
abourers resumed their toil. The bells of the church were
chiming now in token of universal joy.
For—the motor-car had passed through the village and had
gone far, far away.

But you, will not soon be forgotten, young friend 1

You 've plenty to tackle! There's optimist cackle,
And pessimist croaking to hear and to judge:
The welding of patriot bonds that won't shackle,
Divesting imperial spirit of—fudge;
Make friends transatlantic without sham or antic;
Maintain that old Concert, yet not play Dead-March
To simple humanity; neither run frantic
With gush, nor soul-stiffen with diplomat starch;
Preserve our old sea-sway, and keep the nag flying,
Without stint of money, or swaggersome waste;
With everyone friendly, on no one relying,
The empire up-build without rest, without haste;
Bind all English-speakers in cordial communion!
VICTORIA^! Sixtieth then shall appear
To all who love England, and Honour, and Union,
TheHappy New Year!!!
RAILWAY LIE-ABILITY.
DBAB MB. PUNCH,—I am always fond of a joke, and can hear
its repetition, say, a score of times, but I am getting very weary
of that good old jest which meets the eye of the traveller at
every railway station. It runs :—
".Any servant of the company accepting a GHATCITY i* liable to instant
dismissal."
Now for a great many years the directors, the guards, the
porters, and the wayfarers of the United Kingdom must have
enjoyed this jeit de mots, but, like the sandwiches at most re-
freshment rooms, it palls upon the appetite. Personally I re-
joice in infringing this bye-law, and I have never found "any
servant of the company" who didn't heartily join issue with me
in my ill-doing. The liability is so limited, moreover, that I '11
venture to say there isn't a ticket-collector who wouldn't gladly
take preference shares in the National Great Public Tipping
Company. But why make buffoons of those ever-willing, Hard-
working, and, with very few exceptions, always courteous men,
the rank and file of the Railway Army P Now, Gentlemen of the
Railway Interest, this is where your common sense about com-
mon pence ought to come in! At least in the opinion of your
humble admirer, NICODEMUS THB PKBIPATETIO.

[" A great grand-daughter of FIELDING'S has revised Tom Jonet for home perusal."—Daily Paptr.]
IF THE DESCENDANTS OF OTHER LAST-CENTUBY NOVELISTS SHOW THE SAME ENTEKPBISB, WE SHALL HAVE NURSERY SCENES AS ABOVE.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
HEBE is Mr. CLEMENT SHOBTBB'S Charlotte BronW and her
Oirde, published by Messrs. HODDEK AND STOUGHTON. Now to
write a lengthy biography of some celebrity in several volumes
is a laborious work for the compiler, and likely to prove a tedious
study for the reader. But here in this book will be found "a
better and a Shorter way." Mr. CLEMENT SHORTER shows
himself a man of letters and notes, as he limits himself to a col-
lection of epistolary correspondence (CHARLOTTE having been a
very Micawber in this respect), and provides us with his annota-
tions and connecting links as side-lights. An odd sort of indi-
vidual was CHARLOTTE, as is evidenced by her occasionally eccentric
conduct, and by her opinions, as a spinster, on love and marriage
given freely at p. 305, which the Baron advises the reader to com-
pare with her sentiments on the same subjects when subsequently
writing as a married woman at pp. 492 and 493. That she most
highly appreciated THACKERAY is greatly to her credit, but that
she entertained only a qualified admiration for DICKENS shows her
deficient in a certain kind of humour. Of the works of such hu-
morists as HOOD, HOOK, the SMITHS, BARHAM, and others, she
seems to have known little or nothing. TOM HOOD would have
said that in refusing an offer of marriage from the Rev. HENRY
NCSSEY, CHARLOTTE BRONTE might have easily informed him that
"though she would be delighted to live in a rectory, yet she could
not regard with equal pleasure the prospect of taking charge of a
Nussey-ry." She confided .her offers and what she thought of
them to her friends; and very unsentimental, nay, almost heart-
less are her confidential communications on such subjects. Yet
when she was twenty-five she played the one practical joke of
her life which was, as she recounts it, that, being a Protestant,
and residing in Brussels, she went one evening to the Church of
Saint Qudule. and there "an odd whim came into my head," she
writes, and she entered a confessional and went to confession,
just " to see what it was like." However, she was soon detected,
and as. "somehow," she writes, " I could not tell a lie," she owned
herself a Protestant. Then she adds, "I actually did confess—a
real confession." "I think," she concludes, "you had better not
tell Papa of this. He will not understand it was only a prank."
The above is a strange episode in the life of a decidedly serious
young woman of twenty-five, in whom there was no gush, as is
evidenced in her letter (p. 174) on the death of her sister EMILY.
The account of THACKBBAY escaping from his own literary dinner-
party (p. 423) is delightful. Mr. SHORTER has admirably exe-
cuted his self-imposed task, but, excellent as is the index of the
BRONTE Chronology, the absence of dates in the margin, and of
"insets" as side-headings, will be felt by all who wish to use the
volume as a book of handy and ready reference.
The Baron trusts that in the course of time we shall
have a book on Lord LEIGHTON, and one on Sir JOHN MILLAIS,
as perfectly g_ot up as is the splendid work in a single large volume
entitled Meissonier, his Life and his Art, written by M.
VAI.LEBY C. O. GREARD, de I'Academie Franfaise, Vice-Recteut
de I'Academie de Paris, and published by WILLIAM HEINEMANN,
of London. The style of the biographer is as charming ns it is
easy and lucid, and from first to last the matter is made person-
ally interesting. The reproductions of MBISSONIER'S paintings,
sketches, and scraps must delight all his admirers, and will cer-
tainly add to this legion a multitude that have never had the
good fortune to see tie originals of even his best-known highly-
finished pictures. BARON DE B.-W.
SOME NOTES FOR OUTLINES OF ENGLISH HISTORY.—In the sixth
century England was a strictly mathematical country, and its
inhabitants were called " Angles." They were divided into clever
or "Acute Angles," and dense or "Obtuse Angles." Honest
natives were called "Right Angles." That they often lived to a
good old age may be deduced from the frequent mention of "An
Angle of ninety-five .^
IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING.—The Russian Government denies
that it is about to establish a colony on the Red Sea. Of course
the Black C. (of the Press) would not stand any opposition from
something likely to be read.
OUR SHAKSPEARIAN SOCIETY.—In the course of a discussion,
Mrs. observed, that she was positive that SHAKSPEABE was
a butcher by trade, because an old uncle of hers had bought
Lambs' Tails from Shakspeare.
REALLY GENEROUS.—At Christmas time and on New Year's
Day, a billiard marker, who would not like his name made public,
preferring to "do good deeds by stealth," invariably tips all
his cues.

NOTES SUR L'ALMANACH.
DEAR MISTER,—After to have passed several months in Eng-
land, I comprehend to the foundation the manners and the habi-
tudes of that country there, as a tourist, or "globetroter " who
has passed some weeks in China, or as a Member of the Parlia-
ment who has visited the Oriental Indias during the vacations
of the House of the Commons. All the two would write their
impressions of voyage. In doing of same me I have prepared
these notes on the almanack, and I expedite them to you at the
fine of december, when all the world thinks to the almanack of
the new year. Agree, &c., AUGUSTS.
JANUARY.—The Day of the Year. I wish to you, Mister Punch,
the good year! After that I find not that there is much
who arrives during the monih of January. I consult alldays
the Almanack of WHITAKER for 1896, and in January I find but
some errors. It is very curious. Mister WHITAKER says that
the six is the twelfth day. How that? It is perhaps a
fault of imprimary. Then he says "CHARLES THE FIRST be-
headed C. BRADLAUOH," with the date. How that? Then he
says, "H. M. STANLEY, M.P. 1841." There is longtime that
he is deputy. And at above, "H. M. procl. Emp. of India."
I have never heard to say that Mister STANLEY was Emperor of
India. There is invariably some letters "d " or "b " mixed with
the names. Excepted these little errors, the Almanack is ex-
cellent.
FEBRUARY.—The fourteen is the feast of St. Valentine, the day
where the men in England send to their "sweethearts" some
drolls of little madrigals and of other poetrys, printed on paper
adorned of little pictures of hearts, of flowers, and of cupidons.
It is a custom very ancient. There is at present a functionary,
called the "Poet-Laureate," a certain Mister AUSTIN, without
cease occupied to write the poetrys for the "valentines." He
has a pretty talent for that. In february. the sittings of the
Parliament commence ordinarily. It is all regulated for the
sport. When the chase to the fox, the chase to the partridges,
and the chase to the pheasants are almost finished, the deputies
have enough of leisure for to discuss the laws. About this time
here, according to the date of Easter, there is the mardi gras,
the tuesday of shrove, when all the English eat the cakes of Pan,
usage of which one ignores the origin. He has the air of to date
from the time of the ancient Greece.
MARCH.—During this month here ordinarily there has place
the great race of boats from Cambridg to Oxford. It is very
renowned in the sport. The equipage, I'tquipage, who gains
receives a blue ribbon, called "the blue ribbon of the turf." In
England a blue ribbon indicates a man who loves the water.
Many hundreds of sportmen go of good hour to the Thames,
and attend patiently at the border on the mud for to see to pass
the boats._ This is ennuyant, and therefore anything which is
also annoying is called " the blues." At the occasion of this race,
as testimony of sympathy with the two equipages, all the ladies of
the college of Oxford and of the college of Cambridg are dressed
entirely m blue, so entirely that they are called " blue stockings."
APRIL.—The first, in France, one gives sometimes the one to
the other a fish of april. In England the other becomes a fool
of apnl. The Scottish writer CARLYLE, said that the most part
of the English are some fools. Without doubt he wrote this the
first apnl. For, excepted that day there, I find that the English
are not imbeciles of the all. A little egoist, a little that which
one calls "jinggo," but imbecile—ah nol CAKLYLE, being Scot-
tish, wrote the english language with so much of difficulty that
he was obliged continually of to serve himself of german words.
By consequence I comprehend but very little of his works. Better
would value to write entirely in german, a stranger language, as
me I write in english. In this note I speak of Easter. The saint
fnday in England all the world, pour faire maigre, for to make
thin, eats only some drolls of little cakes, extremely unhealthy,
called "Hotcross Buns." They resemble to the horrible " buns"
sold in the restaurants of the english railways. Ah (a, me I
should prefer a thin day to the french, a la franfaise!
MAY.—One calls the first the "Mayday." It is the day where
the English walk themselves adorned of garlands, and sometimes
entirely covered of verdure, that which is called "the wearing of
the green," and he who is within, "a Johnny inside the green."
The first monday of may the opening of the Academy of Arts has
place. There is a small number of pictures, and still less of
statues, in comparison of the two Salons at Paris. Some ones
of the pictures are some chiefs of work, but there is of them
many which are but "boilers of the pot," as say the english
painters, because they serve themselves of them after for to light
the fire. At the end of the month all the world goes to the races,
called "the Epsom," at Darby, chief-place of the department of
the Darbyshir. Sir HARCOURT was formerly deputy of Darby,
but he was not elected after that "the Epsom" was gained two
times of following by the Lord of ROSEBERY.
JUNE.—The lundi de Pentecote is called in England " Wit mon-
day." The English are invariably severe and correct, laughing
very little, but this day here, at that which he appears, they
amuse themselves with some wit. At cause of that all the banks,
all the offices, and all the magazines are closed, because they are
not spiritual of the all, but naturally sad and severe. Then each
one goes himself away some part, bousculi in the stations of rail-
way and in the trains, full of world, and a man of the people is
enough often drunk dead at the fine of the day. See there an
idea of pleasure! Above all the to-morrow when he is con-
demned to pay some amend by the juge de paix, in english, "the
beack." During this month also there is the races of Ascot, and
the great games of cricket on the field of a certain Monsieur C. C.
LORD, that which one calls "M. C. C. Lord's ground." And the
twenty all the world celebrates the Accession of Her Majesty the
QUEEN. Permit, Mister Punch, that a French may say. with the
most great respect and the most humble admiration, God save
the QUKBN."

THE ANNUAL GREETING IN COMMON FORM.
(At the service of those who require the article.)

and chimed in, Ac., Ac.
It is pleasant to consider that, in spite of
an hour or so of sadness, the sum total has
turned out to he, Ac., Ac.
Our foreign relations are still satisfac-
tory, Ac., Ac. It is true that France is
always chafing at the occupation of Egypt,
but in her calmer mood she must be con-
vinced, &c., <fec. Then, Russia is our close
neighbour in India, but when we recollect
that there is much in common, Ac., Ac.
Yet again, Germany can claim kinship with
us, and if her Emperor for a moment
seemed, Ac., &c. So, regarding the out-
look as one not entirely without danger,
we can rest satisfied that England will
always be able, Ac., <fec.
Domestic affairs naturally concern us as
we sit beside the Yule-log, and as we
glance at our boys and girls, education,
Ac., Ac. But the school question is not
unanswerable, and with forbearance and
good-will, Ac., Ac.
In conclusion, we can wait for the tol-
ling bell of St. Paul's without apprehen-
sion, Ac., Ac. The world jogs on with the
monotony of, Ac., Ac. There may be trade
rivalries and political follies, Ac., Ac. For
all that, what England has once done, she
can, Ac., Ac. So there is no reason why
we should not, as Christmas is past, give a
genuinely hearty welcome to the glad New
Year.

lias an empressf manner and an angry smile. DOLLY and DAISY
are pretty girls dressed in pink. TIME— Three in the afternoon.
Mrs. Onslow. It is very curious, but I have an odd presenti-
ment that Lord JASMYN will propose to one of you two to-day, at
our garden-party.
Dolly. Mamma always looks on the bright side, doesn't she,
DAISY.
Mrs. Onslow. But you don't really think he isn't serious?
Daisy. We Ye afraid he's far too serious to propose to people
who are so certain to accept him as—as either of us!
Mrs. Onslow. He has invited himself to lunch twice, lately.
Dolly. That's very sweet and hospitable of him.
Mrs. Onslow. I think it is DOLLY Lord JASMYN admires.
Daisy. Men often pay far less attention to the girl who is
really the object of their thoughts, Mamma, than to a mere
casual acquaintance.
Dolly. He must be very devoted to you, dear!
Mrs. Onslow. He talks more to DOLLY.
Dolly. He talks about DAISY.
Daisy. And to me he talks about Mamma.
Mrs. Onslow. DOLLY, do wear your mauve dress!
Dolly. Oh, please not, Mamma! Mauve is the colour I wear
when I refuse people.
Daisy. You wear it very seldom, darling.
Dolly. Do you mean that I am always accepting people, DAISY?
Daisy. No, dear, no. I didn't mean that. I know you hardly
ever accept anyone.
Mrs. Onslow. I must get EZZIE to persuade you to wear your
mauve. He 's coming early. EZZIE knows so much of the world.
Dolly. EZZIE'S horrid worldliness is no reason why I should
wear mauve when I don't want to, Mamma.
Mrs. Onslow. How obstinate you are, child!
Enter Ezzra, Mrs. ONSLOW'S nephew (twenty), coming down steps
from balcnny.
Ezzie. I 've noticed DOLLY 's always obstinate in pink. Aunty.
(DOLLY offers coffee.) No thanks—if I did it would keep me
awake the whole afternoon.
Mrs. Onslow. I shall leave you for a little while—I 'm coming
back. (Goes up steps_.)
Ezzie. I say. I think these back-garden parties of Auntie's
are perfectly ghastly.
Dolly. So do I.
Daisy. I think they 're very amusing.
lizzie. Oh I That's only your nasty cynical habit of making
the best of everything. You know they're really rather awful.
You don't mind my saying so, do you? I mean, there's never
anyone here one knows.
Daisy. I know; but Mamma gets hold of a whole heap of
celebrities, and Lord JASMYN likes looking at clever people.
Ezzie. How sweet of him! I hate being the only stupid person
in a crowd of clever people—they make such a fuss about one.
Dolly. Instead of talking nonsense, why don't you try and pre-
vent Mamma throwing us at people s heads in the dreadful way
she does?
Daisy. Yes. It makes us so uncomfortable. It's so dread-
fully obvious.
Ezzie. My dear things, it doesn't make the slightest difference.
If she were cool to JASMYN it would give it away ever so much
more. He might think her designing, then—he can't, now.
She 's too frank. Don't you see?
Dolly. It isn't at all nice for us, anyhow.
Daisy. Lord JASMYN has always seemed, lately, as if he were
just going to say something, and then didn't say it.
Ezzie. Why, of course! I quite forgot. He asked me to tell
you. He said he knew you would be pleased.
Dolly. What conceit!
Ezzie. He 's going to be married. To an American girl. He
wants to bring her to see you.
Daisy. Poor Mamma! Another failure!
Dotty. I shall go and put on my mauve dress.
Ezzie. Bear up, DOLLY. You 're looking very beautiful, to-
day. I really must make love to you some time or other.
Dolly. It's dreadful to hear you talk in this way. You used
to be such a nice boy.
Daisy. We used to tell him stories.
Ezzie. Well, I could tell you lots, if you 'd only listen.
Dotty. Oh, you 're quite spoilt, now! But you '11 tell Mamma
—before the people come—about Lord JASMYN P
Ezzie. Yes. I 11 break it to Aunty. She overdoes it, that's
what's the matter.
Daisy. Yes, Mamma overdoes it. (They sigh.)

The only night we ever met,
To take AMANDA in to dinner.
We talked of pictures, hooks, and plays,
Touched on a hundred subjects lightly;
Our tastes agreed in various ways.
And—well, I think—we flirted slightly!
She had to go, alas, next day;
Perhaps she wished—I know that I did—
That, when they asked us down to stay,
Our visits might have coincided.
How often since that day—since then
Remorseless Fate has kept us sun-

And whether she—has also wondered!
None else has made my heart forget,

CINDERELLA (VEEY MUCH UP-TO-DATE).
[" There is a praiseworthy tendency nowadays," remarks a weekly literan
jouinal, " to make children's books instructive as well as amusing.. .. His-
tory and science are eagerly welcomed when disguised in the garb of romance.''
In order to assist this "praiseworthy tendency," Mr. Punch, always well
abreast of the times, hastens to submit some fragments of a new version of an
old fairy-tale, which, when completed, will surely both profit and deUghi
every youthful render.]
ONCE upon a time, assuming for the moment that time has an
existence other than as a conditional necessity of thought, then
lived a girl called CINDERELLA, whose name was doubtless de
rived from the Sanskrit root KIN, despite MAX MULLKR'S state
ments to the contrary. She was very unkindly treated by her
two sisters, whose ill-temper was not unnatural, seeing that the
eldest suffered from insomnia, and had incautiously taken largr
doses of bromide of potassium as a remedy for it. The patho-
logical results of this drug are well known, they include . . . (TV
sert two pages from the "Dictionary of Medicine" here.) The
other sister was, we regret to say, an assiduous reader of old
fashioned fairy-tales, which contain no instruction whatever
and consequently have a most pernicious effect upon tin
character. . . .
So CINDERELLA sat in solitude by the hearth, where the dis-
interred products of the carboniferous epoch were in process ol
slow combustion, and the exudations from her lachrymal glands
coursed slowly down her cheek. Suddenly the door opened; her
fairy godmother entered the room, and said—but it is necessary
to pause here in order to remark that the supposed fairy was, in
point of fact, nothing but a subjective illusion of CINDERELLA'F
excited brain. Such instances of cerebral subconscious activity
are by no means rare, and one theory explains them on thf
grounds . . . (Here follow three pages of psychology.) "And
so," continued the fairy, "you wish to attend the ball to-
night? You shall certainly do so; but first of all give me your
attention while I explain to you the history of dancing, which I
shall do under three heads:—(a) As an act of primitive sym-
bolism, (b) As a part of heathen worship, and (c) As a social
institution." (Copious extracts from the "Encyclopaedia Bri-
tannica" ensue at this point.) "Let me end by reminding you
that you must be home by midnight; indeed, in counselling you
to keep early hours, I am only acting in accord with the leading
physiologists, whose advice upon this point is practically unani-
mous. To quote from a paper read at the last meeting of the
British Association ..."
CINDERELLA'S beauty at once attracted the notice of the Prince,
whose presence was due to the fact that the government of this
country was monarchical. As to the merits of this system as
compared with those of a republican form of rule, it may be
pointed out, in the first place (<fc«., &c.). In fact, go happy
was CINDERELLA that she took no notice of the flight of time,
until a clock at the end of the room, by the help of a familiar
yet ingenious piece of mechanism (here insert a full description
of it, with diagrams), struck twelve times. . . .
"Nay," exclaimed the Prince, "it were needless to place this
vitreous slipper upon thy dainty foot, my beauteous CINDERELLA,
for I have already ascertained that it is a perfect fit by means
of the Rbntgen rays, the working of which I will now explain in
detail," (he does so,) "and therefore I claim thee as my bnde!"
So CINDERELLA'S sisters were overcome with disappointment,
and spent the rest of their days in writing Intellectual Fairy
Stories, which were both Amusing and Instructive, and which
would doubtless have greatly benefited their readers, if there had
been any; only the benighted children showed a marked pre-
ference for tales of the old and foolish kind. But CINDERELLA
married the Prince, and lived happily for about 25'42 years after-
wards, if one may accept Professor SAWDUST'S estimate of the
iverage duration of married life.

"SANTA GLAUS"•; A REMINISCENCE OF CHRISTMAS.
'On! HE 's BEEN!!"
AUGUSTE EN ANGLETEEEE.
NOTES SUR L'ALHAKACH (suite).
JULY.—During this month all the world goes to the regattas of
Henley on the Thames. These regattas are charming, if he falls
not of the rain. Helas! That arrives often in England. All
the long of the river some boat-houses of the most prettys, of the
most coquettes, are placed, and there find themselves reunited
all that he has there of the most elegant—the nobleness, the
sportmen, and the high finance. And above all the most ador-
able misses, themselves charming like some roses, dressed in
pretty robes gay like some flowerSj are there on the boat-houses,
all adorned or pretty plants. It is one can not more gracious.
A little more late there is the races of Goodwood—voila a word
where one finds enough of the letter O, n'est-ce pas?
AUGUST.—The season at London terminates at the fine of the
month of July, and the nobleness and the burgessy go themselves
away, the ones to the regattas of Cows, or to the border of the
sea, the others to the country, or in Scotland, or in the land of
Wales. A great number traverse the sea for to make a voyage of
agreement at the stranger. The English love much the voyage,
and at cause of that one encounters partout the voyagers COOK.
Those who go in Scotland commence the twelve the chase to the
grouses. The regattas of Cows, town of the Island of Wight,
very frequented by the high nobleness, are all that he has there of
the most cheek, Mr. One sees there all the elegant worlders,
mondains. The judges, the advocates, the avoweds, and the
other men of law go themselves away also during the grand vaca-
tions, and of game the bankers quit their banks, the negotiators

SEPTEMBER.—During the month of September the vacations
continue still. There is relaxation, reldche, at almost all the
theatres of London, there is no more of concert, nor of exposi-
tion of pictures, nor of game of cricket, nor of game of " polow"
in the ground of Hurlinggame. The houses of the "Ouestend"
are closed, and one sees there but some "caretackers" and some
cats. During this month there is the races of the Saint Leger.
Until here I have never heard to speak of this saint, of who one
ignores the true name, but it is evident that he was old goodman,
vieux bonhomme, because he loved the races, and was even so gay
that one calls him le saint Uger. He is patron of the "book-
mackers." The twenty-nine, the Saint Michael, all the English
eat some gooses. It is invariably in eating that they celebrate a
feast. At the fine of this month, or in October, the municipality
of London commences the reparation of the pavings, ana each
street becomes an end of sack, cul-de-sac, that which continues
long time after the vacations, sometimes until Christmas.
PEOVINCIAL SKETCHES.
No. VIII.—THE COLONEL.
THK urchins used to tremble when the Colonel's gate they saw,
For trespassers were threatened with the rigour of the law,
And notices were posted up that scared the boldest ones—
"Beware of Savage Dogs I —" Beware of Man-traps and Spring-
guns!"
Behind these formidable works the Colonel felt secure;
He fed his Oloires de Dijon with the choicest of manure,
He thinned his single dahlias or bedded out the stocks,
Or pruned the trees or stuck the peas or trimmed the beds of box.
At times, too, in his study, he would pore with puzzled looks
On tables of statistics in the Government Blue Books,
Make notes with conscientious care, and gather illustration
For his tract. " The Crime of Charity without Discrimination."
And when he met with beggars—and the beggars all took care
He should meet them fairly often—he would fly at them and
swear
They were idle good-for-nothings, and he 'd have them sent
to jail,
And—no I they needn't come to him with any whining tale!—
And he quoted from his pamphlet and dismissed them with a
frown,
And, if no one were about, a surreptitious half-a-cro wn.
The beggars used to thank him for his alms in Heaven's name,
And straightway out of gratitude proceed to poach his game.
Then would the Colonel vow revenge and swear the rogues should
pay.
And might he go to Hades if the rascals got away!
And once it is recorded that his anger hurst all bounds,
And he positively charged a scamp with poaching on his grounds;
But when the rogue was fined and swore he hadn't any pelf,
The Colonel shook him by the hand and paid the fine himself.
The boys, too, lost their terror of the man-traps and spring-
guns,
And the cherry-trees were pillaged by the poachers and their
sons,
Who flocked about the orchard like the bees about a hive,
Till the Colonel vowed he "d take his whip and flay the lot alive.
He caught a pair of urchins and he swore he 'd make them squeal,
He 'd flog them till they couldn't stand—he 'd teach them how to
steal,
And he dragged them off to slaughter.—When the urchins re-
appeared
Their mouths were full of toffy and their cheeks with jam were
smeared.
And so it somehow happened that, despite the strange be-
ginning,
A friendship sprang and flourished 'twixt the sinned against and
sinning,
And often of an evening, when the balmy Zephyr blows,
And the odour of the lavender is mingled with the rose,
The Colonel seeks his garden where he puffs his brown cheroot,
Stretched at his ease beneath the trees among his flowers and
fruit.
Then come the urchins running when his gaunt, grey form they
see,
And they clamour for a story as they crowd about his knee,
And he tells of siege and battle, till the youngsters hold their
breath,
And he tells of deeds of daring in the very jaws of death.
And he tells them of the heroes that have won a soldier's grave,
And he tells them of the elory that is given to the brave.
"Courage 1" he cries. "Be heroes, too, and dare to do and die!
Ah 1 Dulce et decorum est pro patna mori!"
"OH, THE RARITY I "—" Of all the substances we meet with in
this world," says the Scotsman, "water is in many respecta the
most wonderful." There is some obscurity about this frank
admission. Is it water for mixing purposes, or for the morning
tub, the rarity of whose acquaintance extorts the solemn excla-
mation? The fact that it resounds from Edinburgh on New
Year's Eve favours the first suggestion.

f THE OLD TO THE NEW.
"THERH 's nothing new beneath the sun,"
Yet, now the Old Year's course is run,
We greet the next as New.
Ring out, wild bells 1 Well, they ring
out,
But, 'midst their merry noise, we doubt
If more than the old clash and shout
Makes music sweet as true.
As each stout arm tugs at its rope,
We strive to read the tones of Hope
Into the clangorous clatter;
But so we did when Ninety-six
Was at our door. We count our chicks
Before they 're hatched; but Time's old
tricks
Make hope a doubtful matter.
We trust there '11 be a boom in trade,
We hope no other reckless raid
Will gladden Boer and Teuton.
We pray that the Armenian murk
May lighten, that the chuckling Turk
Won't cut us out a mournful work
Humanity fain is mute on.
We hope that Concert may at length
Tune up in unison and strength,
Whoever be its leader.
We trust that Pity may no more
At the barred European door
Stand helpless, for the suffering poor
An unregarded pleader.
But whether anything more new
Than the New Woman greet our view,
Seems just a bit uncertain.
Ring out the old—when the old's bad!—
But, Ninety-seven, my hopeful lad,
Let some "good news" make our hearts
glad
Before you, drop the curtain!

(With Compliments to those who consider Dickens'!•

MB. PUNCH, SIR,—Now that Christmas
is well over, and we have got comfortably
into the New Year, I will let you into s>
secret. I have set my face against all the
absurd customs of Yule-tide, with the hap-
piest result.
I began the festival by ignoring Boxing
Day. Why should the dustman, the baker,
the turncock, and the police have a shilling
a-pieceP They don't give me presents,
then why should I remember them?
Then the idea of commencing tint New
Year peacefully is absurdly conventional.
Why should I outrage my feelings because
one set of 365 days is ended, and another
set of 365 days is about to commence P So
I fell out with my friends and cut my
family all round. I am pleased to say that
at this moment I am not on speaking
terms with my sons, have turned my
daughter out of doors, and have just
signed a deed of separation with my wife.
Thus 1 commence the year untrammelled
by family ties, and free from responsibili-
ties that have always been irksome.
Finally, I conclude by failing to wish
you the compliments of the season, as the
senseless greeting is out of date, and con-
sequently inappropriate. So no more at
present from Yours sincerely,
A. KBRK MUDGEON.

Fields at Eton.
Q. Adopting his opinions for a moment, what do you know or
athletic sports?
A. Next to nothing, as all my knowledge has been derived
TOIIi hearsay evidence.
Q. Could you captain a cricket eleven or a football team P
A. Certainly not; and it would be absurd to learn anything
about the occupation, as the subject is not one recognised by the
examiners.
Q. Could you manoeuvre an army in the field P
A. Not unless I found myself in a position to do so from a
'orced acquaintance with hydrostatics, geometrical drawing, and
other knowledge of a kindred character.
Q. Then you will sacrifice physical fitness to mental progress?
A. I have no choice. I must employ my time in learning the
subjects required by the examiners.
Q. But it this be so, how can you keep up the glory of
England P
A. By following in the steps of my predecessors.
Q. But those steps appear to have been in a different direc-
tion. Can you not find a better answer to the question P
A. In the absence of physical training, I must trust to the fact
that I am by birthright an Englishman.
Q. Certainly. And as an Englishman what is your opinion
on the subject generally?
A. That Britannia rules the waves, and, in spite of the re-
strictions of the examinations, Britons will never, never, never
be slaves. , . . . 0
Q. One question more. Is this last answer of yours logical r
A. No, it is something better—it is patriotic.
THE ARMY CANDIDATE'S VADE MECUM.
Question. Desiring to adopt the military profession—presum-
ably with the view of preserving the honour of the British flag—
what steps are necessary to carry out your patriotic motive?
Answer. It is requisite that I should pass the qualifying ex-
aminations.
Q. Quite so. And how do you propose bringing this rather
ambitious scheme to a successful issue r
A. By obtaining a sufficient number of marks.
Q. Certainly. And how are these to be secured?
A. By spending nearly every hour of five years of my life in
the class-rooms of a professional crammer.
Q. But will not this entail considerable expense?
A. Very considerable; but as it will be borne by my parents
that is a matter that has for me no personal concern.
Q. Will not your parents regard the coach's bills as a pecuni-
ary substitute for the old-fashioned system of purchasing a com-
mission?
A. Most probably; and if my progenitors are good at figures
they will not improbably consider the sum sunk in tuition as
money lost, rather than as cash invested, to be returned on my
retirement from soldiering.
Q. Then cramming serves as a bar to a call to arms as effectu-
ally as purchase?
A. So it may be said. But again, that is an affair that has
no claim upon my individual attention.
Q. Leaving the question of cost out of the calculation, will
not you have to take up a number of subjects that never oc-
curred to the First Duke of WELLINGTON?
A. Undoubtedly; but then his deceased grace had strange
ideas anent the officering of the Army. He is credited with
NO "CURLING" OP THE UPPER LIP.
DKAK MR. PUNCH,—An Army Circular has just been issued,
by which officers of Her Majesty's Land Forces are reminded
that according to Section VET., Par. 26, of the Queen's Regu-
lations : —
'' Moustaches are to be worn, and the chin and under lip are to be shaved
(except by pioneers, who will wear beard*). Whiskem, when worn, are to be
of moderate length."
I know, Sir, that the above notice refers to the fact that many
young military men have recently taken to shaving the upper
lip. But, indeed, the custom has prevailed mainly in stlf de-
fence Let me cite my own case. I had tried for at least
eighteen months to promote the moustaches, so imperatively de-
manded by our Sovereign. The compounds with which. 1 nave
anointed my upper labial have been expensive, irritating, un-
seemly, and, alas 1 useless. I am a congenital JACOB, and if ever
appointed a pioneer could not raise the necessary bird a nest.
As to whiskers, I have often wondered, when looking at pictures
of the late lamented Lord DUNDREARY, whence he derived them.
As a last endeavour to conform with the Queen's commands, I
have under professional advice, severely scraped my face thrice
a day and under the same professional advice I have arrived
at the conclusion that possibly eighteen distinct hirsute tributes
to Her Majesty's regulations—a thin red line indeed—might sur-
mount my teeth. Do you think that Our August Ruler and
Lord WOLSELEY will be satisfied with this show of zeal? Are the
Duke of CAMBRIDGE'S whiskers up to regulation form P Must 1

ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
(Letters from Mr. R. to his Nephew at Cambridge, and to Otheri.)
No. VI.—OF LETTERS—OF YOUTHFUL HUMOUR AND GAIETY—OF
STYLE AND ITS STUDY—OF CHARLES LAMB, HAZLITT, AND
CHAKI.ES KEADK.
MY DEAB JACK,—Your letter demands a reply. You say (I
quote textually) "I have bought NAPIER'S Peninsula and old
AIARBOT, and 1 Ve tackled MAKBOT because he 's shorter. It's
simply ripping. I never read such good fighting in my life.
That bit where his mare tore a Russian's face bang off and pulled
an officer to bits is grand. If old MARBOT has written anything
else I wish you 'd let me know, as I shall certainly buy it." 1
commend your honest enthusiasm, my dear JACK, and I don't
carp at the simple style in which you express it. "Ripping" is
an emphatic word that in its way is probably as good as '' awful,"
and "stunningj" and other words affected by a former generation
of youths for the expression of their astonishment or their plea-
sure; and for my part., I would rather have a lad write a letter
in the style that best suits him for conveying his thoughts, the
direct and forcible style of the schoolboy, than pick and choose
with a precise and laborious care the exotics of language that
convey nothing except the writer's own precious affectation and
lack of sincerity.
^ But there's a happy mean, JACK, there 's a happy mean.
Nearly all youngsters have humour and gaiety, and a bright sense
of laughter. Alas, as life progresses and the world lays its
deadly clutch upon them—wnen they pass from careless youth
to domestic happiness, the payment of weekly bills and the
charge of a growing family afflicted by measles, or clamorously de-
manding to be clothed, to be sent to the seaside or to school, and
generally obscuring the leisure and clogging the energies of their
parents—when, as I say, they suffer this change, gaiety and the
sense of laughter recede at the advent of the rate-collector and
the butcher, and the happy spirit of undergraduate dinners is
turned into the dull and plodding citizen.
Still, while there is youth there is brightness—but the bright-
ness does not often find its way into the letters in which the
feelings of youth are expressed. It is a vain thing consciously
to sit down in order to study style with a view to self-improve-
ment. Legions of prigs and pedants are doing it. I know, all
the world over at this very moment, inspired to their dreadful
undertaking by the rash and unthinking words of this or the
other successful man of letters, who, under the compulsion of an
interview may have confessed that as a boy he formed himself
upon the model of ADDISON, and that to this fact he attributes
the marvellous sale of his latest novel dealing with plot and
passion. So, when stretched upon the rack, or with his thumbs
fixed in the screws, a mediaeval victim would abjure errors of
which he was not guilty, and confess to crimes that he had never
committed. Still, if you read well-written books, your taste in
words and sentences must gradually improve. \Vny not try the
essays and letters of CHARLES LAMB? Even a boy who has just
passed his Little Go (did I congratulate you upon the auspicious
event ?) must, I think, submit to the fascination and enchant-
ment of this master of insight, whimsical humour and playful,
tender regret. And how manly he is in the midst of his weak-
nesses, how simple, how human. If you read his letters you
will learn to love him not merely as a writer, but as a friend en-
deared to your heart by innumerable acts of affection and friend-
ship, and by delightful sallies never darkened by the sullen,
§loomy breedings that make companionship and life itself a bur-
en. Then, if you want another manly, breezy, hard-hitting
fellow to cheer you along, take a turn with HAZLITT, and begin,
as you are fond of fighting, with his account of the prize-fight at
Bristol, in which the Gasman was forced to throw up the sponge.
There 's a piece of splendid writing for you. I cannot think of a
higher compliment than to say that it does not suffer even by
comparison with that immortal battle in Rodney Stone, with
which my friend Mr. CONAN DOYLB has lately set our sluggish
blood tingling. And for another fight take dear old crotchety
CHARLES READE'B Hard Cash. I tooli it up again only the other
day, and had to read it to the end before I put it down. They
talk rashly of epics now and again, I notice, in connection with
SOMIH book or other that comes tumbling into the reviewer's
hands, but Hard ('ash is an epic if ever there was one, and the
fight of the East Indiaman with the pirate ships is one that
HOMER would have rejoiced to witness, and to consecrate in
hexameters.
Farewell; JACK; I am glad to hear that your new dog is no
undistinguished or merciful enemy of rats. My compliments to
him, and my love to you. Your affectionate uncle, BOB.

strued him, it is PINDAB! What can we
want with another of him? I wish that

surely one Greek ode-grinder is enough

Now look here, Mr. Punch! England
is now bossing Egypt. Let that splendid
fellow, the Sirdar — Happy New Year to
him!—put his foot down on grave grub-
bing and poet-hunting like a cart-load of

May make them wax and then decline;
But in their purpose they are One,
Sooner or later they combine.
Fair, fleecy clouds that fleck the sky
With little languors lean and light,
Like lashes long of Heaven's eye,
Are guileless of its thund'rous might.
But, as the rivulet, the cloud
Foregathers heavy, filled with ire,
And lifts its angry voice aloud,
Charged with the majesty of fire!
The stone that rolls in yonder reach,
Hurled to and fro by every tide,
Is but a plaything of the beach,
An enemy the cliffs deride.
Yet in the coming by-and-by,
When fierce the wave and high the blast,
The cliffs will learn their doom is nigh;
The pebble wins the game at last!
A man of worth and dauntless pride
Once reared a castle on a hill,
And thence his eager foes defied
To do his resting-place an ill.
And truly one by one they fell,
By watch and valour ever cleft;
United, though, they broke the spell,
And knight and castle were bereft!
There was a maiden fain to live
As princess in a fragrant land,
And oh I she said she would not give
To any cavalier her hand.
But then there came a stalwart knave—•
A many-witted lad was he—
His many wits made her his slave,
And gladly she his bride would be.

In feeble rhythm, halting rhyme;

IN THE LONDON FOG.
"B. AND S." writes as follows from
Chickweed Park, Hants : —
In the interest of science it may be
well to record a plain statement of the
impression made on the overwrought and
peculiar organisations of two individuals
by the fog in London the other night.
The night of its appearance I was stay-
ing at the Grand Hotel, Northumberland
Avenue, with a friend, and we both sallied
forth dinnerless by way of the Strand to
the Gaiety Theatre, stopping several times
en route—the journey from Charing Cross
occupying just over two hours. We agreed
to sup after the play. On arriving at the
theatre we both experienced a dull, dead
depression of the brain, and neither of us
can even now tell what was the name of the
piece, or what it was all about. How we
g«t back to the Grand through the murky
gloom I know not. Our symptoms can
only be described as those of semi-
stupidity, and the hotel porter, _who helped
us into bed, was clearly of opinion that we
had had too much chloral, tor he begged
us to be careful with the matches. We
slept dead-dog sleeps, unconscious of
everything, and woke late the next morn-
ing, incapable of eating breakfast. There
was a kind of buzzing in my head, with a
nauseating desire to avoid food. We re-
solved to return to the country at once.
Somehow we reached Waterloo station,
and were rolled like milk cans into the
train. What happened during the jour-
ney neither of us knows, but luckily the
guard was an old friend, and pulled us
out at the right station. Still the same
stupor oppressed us, and when we got
home the manservant and the gardener
had to carry us upstairs.
Next day I awoke, feeling no better, and
discovered that I had retired to rest in my
hat, placed my boots under the pillow, hung
my trousers out of the window, and put
my watch and chain in the water-jug.
On crawling to my friend's room, I found
that he was nowhere visible, and his
couch had not been slept upon. Seriously
alarmed, I was about to pull the bell for
assistance, when I heard stertorous noises
proceeding from the wardrobe, one of
the roomy old-fashioned kind. My poor
friend was doubled up in it, feebly calling
"steward." I summoned assistance, and

had him, despite my own wretched plight,
carefully tucked up in bed. We slept for
fifty-three hours, with intervals for the
consumption of soda water. This evening
I am rather better, but it has taken
me all day to write this letter. The
swollen feeling of pur heads is decreas-
ing, but the burning pain of the eye-
balls, the shaking of our hands, and
the parched conditiom of our tongues, re-
main. What has happened to us? Will
any scientist explain? The moral is, in
any case, avoid London fogs. There can
be no doubt that they contain _ a brumous
poison of hypnotic power. Will chemists
analyse it? If so, our sufferings will not
have been useless, since humanity will
profit by them.

ALADDIN AT THE LANE; OR, NEW LAMPS FOR OLD ONES.
BRILLIANT and artistic in costumes and kaleidoscopic effects of

BLANCHE is on the stage, and arousing the crowded house to in-
extinguishable laughter whenever that most eccentric comedian
Mr. DAN LENO is very much "in evidence," supported by the
burly-esque actor, Mr. HERBERT CAMPBELL, who may be con-
sidered as representing the breadth of the piece, and by tall Mr
FBITZ RIMMA representing the length, the Pantomime at Old
Drury has entered on a successful career.
Its concoctors, Messrs. STURGESS and LENNARD, practised hands
at this sort of work, can now afford to cut out and compress •
and they would not have had to do this had they gone straight
away with the old familiar story, and had they "come to
Hecuba m four scenes instead of in seven. It is a tribute to the
arrangement and general supervision of Mr. OSCAR BARRETT to

at Y.dO. it finished, harlequinade and all, by just five minutes to
eleven?
Miss ADA BLANCHE, prince of burlesque princes, is admirable
Aladdin, working with a will that would keep going even a
less successful extravaganza. DKCIMA MOORE is a sweet
nadroulboudnur. Miss CLARA JECKS is full of vivacity as a little
3un«se maid; Miss PILLANS is a stylish Prince Pekoe, and Mr.
ERNEST D'AunAN shows himself worthy of the family name by
his capital impersonation of the small part of the dancing-master.
DAN LKNO as Widow Twankay is inimitable I Whether he
smirks, or stares, or smiles, or frowns, or bows, or curtseys,
or stumbles, or runs, or dances, or attempts to sing, or has a
dialogue with HERBERT CAMPBELL, or is thoroughly happy or
thoroughly upset, it doesn't matter what he does, the house is
at once in roars of laughter. The audience cannot have enough
of him, and he never overdoes anything.

"AND this is the moral of my song, which must, and always, be:
I care for NOBODY, no not 11 if NOBODY cares for me!"
How DID HE GET THERE ?—A correspondent of the Daily Tele-
graph, referring to Ventnor, says, "Here is a town on English
soil where the fairest northern winter sunshine may be enjoyed
oithout crossing the seas." Has the long-talked-of tunnel be-
.ween the mainland and the Isle of Wight been constructed P or
las one of the legendary submarine passages been discovered? or
have Spithead and the Solent dried up? The writer should
really give his reasons for his startling statement.
LITERARY INTELLIGENCE.—It is announced that "Sir ROBERT

SIR,—As all the campaigns in the future will be conducted
entirely upon paper, I venture to suggest that the test provided
for the efficiency of Army candidates by the proposed Wool-
wich entrance syllabus cannot be described as unduly severe.
The sooner, in fact, that the standard is raised by the introduc-
tion of Obligatory Qualities and Dynamics of the Fourth Dimen-
sion, the better for the service and for all concerned. What,
I ask, will be the use of our coming generals if, at the age of
seventeen, they are unable to floor a five hours' paper in ele-
mentary subjects such as these, which are so highly necessary
for a military career? What will become of their Intelligence
Department if each budding lieutenant has not, at an early
stage, mastered by heart so rudimentary an acquirement as a
knowledge of CHAMBERS' 10,000 logarithms to seven places? I
tremble to think of their certain breakdown in time of war, in
grim and real earnest, if these important qualifications are neg-
lected. Let the country awake to its responsibilities in time I
I am, Sir, your obedient servant,
A PROFESSOR OF HIGHER MATHEMATICS.
SIR,—Class II. in the Syllabus for Army Candidates might,
with advantage, be extended. Metallurgy, the art of ceramics,
high-class undertaking, scientific dress-making, legerdemain,
the theory of top-dressing, dentistry, thought-reading,
French cookery, plate-laying, the use of the tammy, and window-
gardening should all be included in the education of our future
warriors. You never know when an odd little piece of out-of-
the-way knowledge may not be useful in dealing with the foe.
Yours fatuously, WHITE KNIGHT.
SIR,—I trust, I sincerely trust that these Army entrance ex
animations will be discontinued. We are already becoming
inconveniently crowded. Our officers had better be made in
Germany.. Yours, HANWELL.
SIR,—It would be well to introduce the Chinese system
here. We want genuine literati in command of our battalions
Until archeology and anthropology are taken up in a less
half-hearted way than at present, I fear our existing system
of cramming can hardly be considered complete. What we
want is the production of a corps of thoroughly nice and gentle-
manly bookworms, well-versed in the literature of war, to con-
duct our theoretical military operations in the future.
Yours obediently, BEDRIDDEN.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THE Colossus was content to bridge the harbour that opened
on to Rhodes. In The Yoke of Empire (MACMILLAN), Mr.
REGINALD BRETT strides across five Prime Ministers, and
pats approvingly on the shoulder the Sovereign they have
served. Incidentally he remarks that a rival commentor on
history, one MAOAULAY, "possessed a genius for commonplace."
The Equator does not come in, or, with even more certainty
than SYDNEY SMITH attributed to JEFFREY, Mr. BRETT would
have spoken disrespectfully of it. As it is, he is occasionally
above the rules of grammar, speaking, for example, of Mr.
GLADSTONE'S "relation to" the QUEEN. What he related is not
reported. Minor authorities would probably have written of the
ex-Premier's "relations with" Her Majesty. These little foibles
apart, Mr. BRETT deals with an interesting subiect in a bright,
occasionally a picturesque, manner. A fault in style, if fault
may be hinted in such connection, is that, treating each chap-
ter as if it were a platform speech, he rounds it off with a pero-
ration — a breathlessly long sentence, such as only Mr. GLADSTONE
might be counted upon to deliver without stumbling. The
volume is enriched by half-a-dozen portraits, of themselves worth
more than its price. That of Mr. GLADSTONE is, my Baronite
says, the very best presented of him durine the last ten w>r«.
With respect to Echoes from the Oxford Magazine, published
some time ago, we are all of Oliver Twist's mind, and want
"More." Mr. HENRY FROWDE, ever ready to oblige, has issued
a second series, under the title, More Echoes. They are, like the
contents of the preceding volum", culled from the luxuriant
garden of the Oxford Magazine, having come up between 1889
and 1806. In a prologue, presumably written specially for this
volume, "Q," an early contributor to the Oxford Magazine,
shows what strength and perfect finish may be acquired as time
flies and practice grows. A few of the colts are a little wild,
presenting in their lightheartedness some amazing rhymes. Ex-
ceedingly clever are Mr. MERRY'S "Afternoon Sermons at St.
Mary's," and T. R.'s " Meister Wilhelm in Oxford," which has a
fine smack of CANNING'S verse in the old Jacobin. As for Mr.
GODLEY, he is an acrobat, almost a contortionist in rhyme. He
can, my Bnronite protests, do anything he pleases with syllables,
has even wriggled a passable rhyme out of the apparently im-
possible DEMOSTHENES.*
• The Baron has not seen the book reviewed by his Baronite, but, inspired,
he proposes an original couplet:
"I Rend TOU u statue: regret it has l«st 'lie kneen;
Tis otherwise perfect. They cay 'tis DEMOSTHENES."

AN IMPALED BURT.
MB. Alderman BURT, of Richmond, Surrey, is, according to
the Morning and other papers, endeavouring to spoil the view
from the Terrace by advocating the substitution of an iron fence
for the picturesque holly and thorn hedge between the hill and
the sloping meadow. Richmond without its view would be like
Hamlet minus the Prince of DENMARK. This doubtless worthy
and possibly eminent citizen should remember that "it is an ill
Burt which fouls its own nest." But perhaps the alderman is
like the proverbial cuckoo, and has laid his municipal egg on
premises which scarcely concern him. In any case, Mr. Punch
recommends this particular Burt to respect the wishes of the
dwellers on the Terrace in particular, and the landscape-lovers
of the world in general, and should he be a reflective Burt, like
the jackdaw, to remember that hedges always afford more con-
venient shelter than the best gilt-topped metal clothes-props ever
constructed. The terrible desecration of the walk just inside
the Park gates should convince even the Corporation of Rich-
mond that the Age of Stone and the Age of Iron cannot redeem
affronts offered to the Age of Nature. Therefore, Mr. Punch
trusts that, like Folly, this particular Burt will (metaphorically)
be shot flying as he wings his way Desart-wards over the Peter-
sham Meadows.

THE DUELLIST'S VADE MECUM.
(From the Qerman.)
Question. From the point of view of an officer and a Teuton is
duelling to be discouraged?
Answer. To an officer it is undoubtedly a necessity, although
to a civilian it may be considered a superfluity.
Q. Why is it a necessity?
A. Because the Kaiser considers the honour of the uniform of
paramount importance, and that honour can only, under certain
circumstances, be protected by the sword.
Q. And when ia duelling a superfluity?
A. At times when the Emperor regards the practice as immoral
Torn a civilian point of view.
Q. How can you reconcile the two views?
A. By appealing to a Court of Honour.
Q. Will this course be invariably satisfactory?
A. Certainly not, as it may cause a delay derogatory to the
Emperor's uniform.
Q. And this unavenged insult will merit punishment at the
hands of the head of the army?
A. It will: and consequently it may be desirable to act with-
out waiting for the decision of the Court.
Q. But supposing an officer yields to this impulse and calls out
lis opponent, what will he the probable result?
A. That he will be reported to the Emperor for disobedience.
Q. And what will be the consequence?
A. He will run the risk of being cashiered, or incur some
punishment of equal gravity.
Q. In this event, will the Emperor act as head of the army or
ruler of the State?
A. It matters little whether one or the other, or both.
Q. You consider the result will be the same?
A. Unquestionably; and there seems to be no way out of the
difficulty.
Q. Then the officer and the Teuton will find himself in an un-
)leasant position at all times?
A. He will discover himself impaled on the horns of a dilemma.
Q. Is there anypossible sojution to the problem?
A. But one. The best thing he can do is to resign his com-
mission^ prior to residing permanently in London, and becoming a
naturalised Englishman.
Q. Would such a course be patriotic?
A. Scarcely, but something wiser—infinitely more convenient.

Suggest there ts a difference, clear and

'Twixt rectitude — though unctuous — and
sheer wrong.
"Vulgar colloquialism." Bless my heart I
We fancied you considered slang so smart!

But—is there no such thing as prioi

And it might seem 'tis not alone the Dutch
Who give too little and who ask too much.
"The devil take the hindmost" sounded
grand;
Now "let the foremost take the hinter-
land"
Appears to supersede that ancient saw.
Roll over " rectitude," and banish law;
"All put their shoulder to the wheel?"
Quite so.
But let it be the common weal, you know!
Even if you 're the "hub." It is no joke
In all wheels save one's own to nut a
spoke.
"No foreign interference." Good, as such!
But might not KRUOER and his sturdy
Dutch
Quote it against the raiders? Sauce's use
By a shrewd gander may not please the

But then, 'twill need a modern ALEXANDER
To give monopoly to goose or gander.
Be orchids or expansion a man's hobby,
To sneer at it unfairly's small and snobby.

THE OIIANUE FBEK STATB.—The state of the London Pave-
ments during the orange season.
OUK BOOKING-OFFICE.
IF Launee Kennedy had been somewhat less garrulous, Mr.
CBOCKETT'B latest novel, The Grey Man (Fisiimt UNWIN), would
hare been more delectable. In telling this story, Launee so
overloads the narrative with detail as frequently to defeat bis
purpose of making things clear. Its progress is with direful
industry drearily halted. At certain epochs, Launee rises
above temptation, and lapses into clear, strong, picturesque
narrative that has not, my Baronite assures me, been excelled
by WALTER SCOTT or STEVENSON. Once this haps where he
carries the challenge of his master to the Laird of Horse. Again
he shakes off the thrall of prolixity when he pictures the trial
and execution of the Grey Man. In these two passages the
incidents are so dramatic, the movement so swift, the description
so picturesque, as to atone for the otherwise prevalent fault.
It is a pity BROWNING has not lived to see the beautiful
edition of his poetical works just published. Messrs. SMITH,
ELDER have for one issue had recourse to the magic India paper
of the Oxford University Press. The result is that the seventeen
volumes in which the poems originally saw the light are given in a
book of less than eight hundred pages, legibly printed, much
lighter than an ordinary volume of its size, and bound in royal
crimson morocco. It is an tuition de luxe without the necessity,
once pictured in these pages, of the hapless owner lying prone on
the floor with the mammoth book open before him, that being the
most convenient way of mastering its contents. In addition to
this gem of the printers' and bookbinders' craft the publishers
issue a complete cheap edition of the works in two volumes of
ordinary library fashion. Mr. AUOCSTTNE BIKRELL edits it,
and helps the unconverted by, as he modestly puts it. ex-
plaining in the margin the meaning of " such words as might, if
left unexplained, momentarily arrest the understanding of the
reader." There are some who are most fully in accord with
BBOWNINO when he writes,
I still
Stand in the cloud, and, while it wraps
My face, ought not to speak perhaps.
For these the physical charm of the India-paper edition will
be a delight. For the rest who can (or think they can) pierce the
cloud that habitually wraps the poet's face, the work-a-day
edition will serve.
Some readers of the Life and Letters of Sir Charles Halle
(SMITH, ELDER) will agree with my Baronite in the opinion that
the most interesting chapters are those which contain HALLE'S
early letters to his parents dated from Darmstadt and Paris.
He was just launched on the sea of life. His observation
was keen, his mind impressionable, out of a full heart he
communed with the home circle, for whose companionship he
yearned. Many of the later letters might have been omitted
from the bulky volume, and the prosaic accounts of the visits to
Australia and the Cape were better retained for family reading.
The judicious reader can effect compression for himself, after
which process he will find much of interest in the simnle story
of a strenuous life. THB BARON.

SPOETIVE SONGS.
A South-country Foxhunter, on a New Forest Pony, celebrates his
triumph over a Midland "bullfincher."
HE has come in his pride, just to show us the way,
From the country of grassland and spinnies,
And the hunter he's on, so I heard his groom say,
Cost at Melton a "half thou. of guineas."
His seat is a model, his boots cling like wax,
And his hat has a workmanlike air,
And his well-fitting coat is not one of those sacks
That we poor Southern countrymen wear.
Note the hand that he bears on his high-mettled mare,
While her antics he readily baffles,
And seems ev'ry movement of spirit to share
As he curbs it with lightest of snaffles.
He has greeted the Master, saluted the Field
And, I notice, is friendly with you;
I 've no doubt that he thinks that all present must yield
To the charm of the noureou venu.
Here are you on the castaway peacocky weed
That has little to boast of but rank,
And my sorry old nag is of true Forest breed,
But a bad 'un to beat at a bank,
You may laugh at the Forester coarseheaded brute,
But I swear he shall show you to-day
That o'er heather and bog, and mid tangle and root,
There is none like my ill-favoured grey 1
Just another low laugh and another soft look—
Then the melody-mongers give cry.
We are off I He is leading us all at the brook
By the firs where the scent is so high,
By the copse, where the hazels are crackling and sear,
You endeavour to keep with his pace;
Can't you see that he's out trying to steer,
And that you are not making him race?
Good fox! he has turned from the flint-powdered ridge
To the vale, where the meadows lie dank,
And the hounds are now streaming to right by the bridge,
On the left I will take them in flank.
Go on, dear old Heiigist, I give you your head,
Tis wiser than mine is to-day.
Yes! ford it quite gently-—the water runs red
With the blood of the churn in the clay I
Good hounds 1 they have followed the quarry right well,
But the pace is too good long to last.
And what has become of the Leicestershire Swell
Who started the running so fast?
And where, and oh! where is that Queen of the Chase
Who broke with that terrible rush P—
Yet your trophies another fair tribute shall grace,
For Hengist and I take the brush!
AUGUSTS EN ANGLETEEEE.
NOTES SUR L'ALMANACH (suite).
OCTOBER.—The chase to the pheasants commences the first, anc
during this month here there is the chase to the "cubs." For
that one lifts himself of very good morning, in effect, during the
night. The English love much the cold bath, and me also, be-
cause I find that ne is very fortifying, though it is not the habitude
of my compatriots. But during the night a cold bath at the
candle, or at the electric light—ah, no! At the fine commences
the chase to the fox, and also the sittings of the courts in the
Palace of Justice. MaUre Kenard and the advocates in same
time—that has the air of a fable of LA FONTAINE. Only, the fox
goes quick and loses, the law goes slowly and wins. The twent;
and one the English celebrate the battle of Trafalgar. Me I se
not for what not, although some French find there some injuries
against our country. Provided that one is not chavvin, in eng
lish "jinggo," and too hostile towards the other nations, the lovi
of the country is a sentiment which is no part more admired than
in France.
NOVEMBER.—At this season, or more soon, the great fogs o
London commence. We have sometimes at Paris some fog, but
my faith, that it is nothing I Ordinarily the fog at London com
mences at the fine of October, and, augmenting during the frost
continues until to the spring. Some days he is less thick, ani
even one can to see the sun, absolutely as one sees him throug]
some smoked glass, without rays or brilliance. But the most par

of the days one sees not the sun, and ordinarily the fog is suchly
—tdlement—thick, that one sees neither the sky nor the earth,
only the air. And the air is all simply the smoke, un veritable
climat d'enfer, mais froid! The nine there is a great procession
and a great banquet at London for to celebrate the day of birth
of the Prince of WALKS. Speaking of the City, I wish to make
to remark my compatriots that the Lord Maire is not a great
personage of the Government, as the Main', du Palais of the
middle age. He is all simply the Prefect of the Thames—the
Prefet de la Seine of London.
DECEMBER..—The fogs continue still more thick. During all
this month here the English make some vast preparations for the
most great feast of all the year, when, following their habitude,
they eat, and this time enormously. Ordinarily at Christmas he
makes a time unbelieveably sad. Sometimes he falls some rain,
sometimes he makes some fog, sometimes there is all the two
together, invariably there is much of mud and much of obscu-
rity; never the sun; never the fine time, excepted this year
who comes of to finish, when the sun shone during two days,
that which is all to fact exceptional. Thus, for to amuse
themselves, the unhappy English are obliged of to shut themselves
at them—chez eux—of to light the lamps at midday, and of to eai
just to the night. At Christmas in England, and above all at
London, the night and the day it is the same thing. Seen these
habitudes so melancholy, it astonishes me that the English are
not much more sad. In effect they are sometimes narquois anc
pay. With a fine irony they call feast there "The Merry
Christmas." Voila, Mister Punch, a pleasantery of your com-
patriots, worthy of to be printed in your journal so illustrious—

shall the houses on this street be twenty stories high, and de-

THE IDEA!
["If all the theatres in London, the 'serious'
houses included, were shut up at this moment,

doubt. But how many ideas?"—Daily Chronicle.]
A LONELY idea went limping along,
Dreary and desolate, doubtful and dim;
There were nil sorts of folk in the hurrying
throng,
From poets to patriots, but none wanted
him!
The statesman severely his head at him
shook;
To be seen in his company simply meant
smash.
The author, to whom he suggested a book,
Turned pale, and declined to do any-
thing rash.
The novelist said, "Why, good gracious,
you 're New!
And newness in novels is never allowed!"
The poet, who, perched on Parnassus

Party cries and sensations were much in
request,
But ideas were under the strictest taboo.
They upset the world, destroyed comfort
and rest;
You never could calculate what they
might do.

He carried a big old black bag on his

Explain that I haven't the vaguest idea

"But you must have Royalty on board,"
he persists. "Look at your flag."
He is directing my attention to the
pockethandkerchief which cost me eighteen
pence.
The band again starts the National An-
them. This is too much, and I say so.
"Not at all," is the polite reply, "as I
feel convinced that you have a right to fly
that illustrious emblem."
It now occurs to me that the eighteen-
penny handkerchief shows the royal
standard.
"You are a member of the royal
family," suggests the naval officer.
"No, Sir, is my response; "I am only
Mr. TOMPKINS."
The naval officer utters a mighty nauti-
cal imprecation. Things are becoming
serious. Have I been guilty of piracy, or
what?
At this moment the boat is struck by
a torpedo sent out in practice and col-
lapses. Then the naval ship collides
against another vessel, and both disappear
together. In a second my vessel (the
Saucy Sarah) is alone on the ocean.

But, to prevent further mistakes, I re-
move the royal standard from the mast,
and once more all is peace and quietness.

the beginning of my fortune. I sang of
those cities, of their exquisite beastliness
and their divine debauchery. The Deca-
dents hailed me as a Brother, and I ex-

CANINE SAGACITY.
A DOG'S SUICIDE THROUGH AFFECTION.
DEAR SIR,—Allow me to add to the present interesting corre-
spondence a really touching instance of canine devotion. To my
mind, any evidence of a higher nature in animals is of infinitely
greater value than, mere proofs of cleverness, or feats of vin-
dictive memory. From this point of view, the St. Bernard
puppy of your first correspondent ranks considerably higher in
the scale of interest than the dog described in a later issue.
Now for my own contribution to this fascinating subject.
An aged female relative of mine possessed a fancy spaniel,
named Sniff, which displayed a wealth of affection for his mis-
tress, unadulterated by the snappishness towards other people
which so often renders such a dog objectionable. He had, it is
true, a slight tendency to gluttony; but then, none of us are
perfect 1 Several months ago the old lady died, and, by her own
wish, the dog was transferred to my little suburban home, in
the hope that he might forget his loss amid new surroundings.
Alas, he proved inconsolable, for, within twenty-four hours,
we found him lying stark and stiff in the garden—poisoned I
There is no room for doubt that poor little Sniff, crazed by
his grief, deliberately ran out of the bouse to seek the means of
putting an end to his existence, and found what he sought for in
some pieces of poisoned meat left near the greenhouse by my
gardener. I may say, in passing, that the man (whom I severely
reprimanded) had left the poison about, without my knowledge,
with the object of exterminating the cats which ruined his bud-
ding plants.
Now, what can be more admirable than Sniff's refusal to sur-
vive his loved mistress? Surely we might go far to find a
parallel among ourselves. I am quite aware that many people
may object on moral grounds to this admiration, and certainly I
do not wish it to be supposed that I hold a brief for suicide—
far from it. But I think we should be very careful how we lay
down the same laws for animals as for human beings in a matter
of this kind, and, although my way of looking at things is often
blamed, I am not ashamed to subscribe as

FOUNDED ON FACT.
DEAR OLD PUNCH,—As the holidays are nearly over, I don't
spend much time in reading the papers. But the other day I
came across some elderly fossil complaining that the public did
not nearly sufficiently appreciate our national collections. This
is all nonsense, at least so far as the rising generation is con-
cerned. Take myself, for instance. I have three brothers and
three sisters, and we all have friends who have also brothers and
sisters. So when we are gathered together, we are a tidy lot—
not as regards apparel, but you know what I mean. Well, what
do we do with ourselves? Why, we go to the British Museum.
"Very good," say you: "nothing like improving your minds."
Right you are; it is nothing like." We go to the museum,
not to look up mummies, but to play at hide and seek. First-
rate fun, I can tell you! No chivying one another in a rude,
noisy fashion, but politely asking the way of a policeman. WTien
we catch the runner we shout a little, but not louder than an
antiquarian making a discovery.
And now that the movement has commenced, why should it
stop at Bloomsbury? Surely the School of Mines might be
cleared of its cases, and used for lawn tennis, and no one would
object (at least, we wouldn't) to the large hall of the Natural
History Museum being set apart for football or a game • of
cricket.
Say a word for us, dear old fellow, and merit the gratitude of
your sincere well-wisher, JONES MINOR.

That the Admiral should, after the ver-

convey to William his own private opi-
nion of his own public and official conduct,
by allowing the prisoner to kiss his hand,
is, as I am informed, a stage tradition,

MR. TOM COLLINS, LATE M.P., AND EUCENE ARAM, DECEASED.
EXTRACTS FROM THE TRAVEL DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Enaresboroiigh, Monday.—SARK tells me that from earliest
youth Knaresborough has possessed for him two over-
powering attractions. One lingers round EUGENE ARAM, with
whom, of course, he had no personal acquaintance. The other
centres upon TOM COLLINS, first returnpd to Parliament for
Knaresborough in the Exhibition year. For a while, in the stress
of political weather, TOM migrated to Boston, representing that
borough from 1868 to the General Election in 1874, when he
temporarily disappeared from the Parliamentary scene. He came
back with the blossoms of May in 1881, Knaresborough once
more having elected its distinguished townsman.
SARK well remembers TOM COLLINS'S reappearance. It
was in the time of trouble about BRADLAUOH and the oath he at
first wouldn't take and then persistently demanded. WILFRID
LAWBON had his little joke at the expense of the unsuspecting
THOMAS. When the new Member for Knaresborough presented
himself at the table, and claimed to take the oath, Sir WILFRID,
textually following a proposal earlier made by STAFFORD NORTH-
COTE in the case of BRADLAUGH, moved for " a Select Committee
to ascertain the views of the new Member on the question of the
sanctity of an oath."
This was fun to the House, but it was nearly death to TOM
COLLINS. Brought up in the odour of sanctity—his father was
either rector or vicar of Knaresborough—T. C. found himself
under the awful suspicion of being even as BRADLAUOH. He was
assailed with remonstrance and advice from well - meaning
persons in all parts of the country. Tracts were thrust into his
hands as he left the Commons. Occasionally he found two or
three in the voluminous recesses of his umbrella. The climax was
reached when a petition was forwarded to him on behalf of BRAD-
LAUQH asking him to present it. After suffering in silence for
a space of nearly two months, he one day rose and claimed the
indulgence of the House whilst he made a personal statement
repudiating the insinuation of Sir WILFRID.
The House never took TOM seriously, and roared with laughter
throughout his lachrymose lament.
As for WILFRID LAWSON, he was incorrigible. There was talk
at this time about the long delay following upon the Knares-
borough Election before the new Member came to take his seat.
"Very odd," said Sir JOHN MOWBBAT, "that TOM COLLINS
doesn't turn up."
"Not at all, said Sir WILFRID; "he 's waiting for an excursion
train."
This jibe was founded upon rumour, probably as groundless
as that about his views on the sanctity of an oath, that T. C.
was, not to put it too strongly, penurious in his habits. He
certainly did not waste money upon his tailor. It was his
boast that the COLLINS family had lived in Knaresborough for
two hundred years. The cut and the decayed colour of his even-
ing suit suggested that it had been a heirloom for at least half
that period. But his dress-coat was quite a gay young thing
compared with his umbrella. It was credibly asserted that this
was the third structure of the kind made in England. Faded to
dust-colour, it was tied midway with a piece of tape, a restriction
it resented by bulging forth in a series of gingham carbuncles.
TOM and his umbrella were inseparable. Wet or fine he always
carried it with him, nor would he trust the precious relic to the
chances and changes of the cloak-room. He brought it into the
lobby and carefully deposited it behind the chair of the principal
doorkeeper, holding him personally responsible for its safety. It
was after reposing in what he fondly believed was a place of
security that T. C. one night found his old companion stuffed
with a bundle of tracts, detailing with graphic power the down-
ward course and ultimate end of an atheist.
SARK was recalling these things as we stood this afternoon on
the site of Knaresborough Castle, looking on the beautiful scene
spread around, with the river flashing far below beneath the
bare trees. There is singularly little left of the Castle;
a cluster of roofless rooms over a ruined gateway; here and
there a bit of bowed wall, standing up like the fangs of a
mammoth jaw. We see the old church, the peerless bridge, the
houses clambering up the hill, growing quite red in the roof
with the effort. On the pleased reflection suddenly breaks a
voice. A boy had followed us as we made the tour of the
Castle. Now he came to a halt, and, with faraway look, began
to reel oil' some topographical details snipped, as he subsequently
confessed, from a guide-book.
He was the oddest automaton I ever saw in biped form. His
waistcoat, unbuttoned, disclosed the poverty of a single brace.
One hand was thrust in his pocket, the other hung limp at his
side. With eyes fixed on the horizon, and total absence of ex-
pression on his face, he began to tell how the castle was built in
1017: how it was destroyed by CRUMioeZf; how, near by, was
the Dropping Well; also the cave of Mother SHIPTON, who had
prophesied, amongst other things, that carriages would some day
cross the bridge without horses.
"She meant the railways," said the Oracle, parenthetically,
without variation of tone or withdrawal of his gaze from
the horizon. Further prophecy portended that after the said
brid/e had fallen three times, the end of the world would come.
"It's broke down twice," said the Oracle, absolutely un-
moved at the imminence of catastrophe.
"A mile distant is the cave where EUGENE ARAM murdered
HOUSEMAN. This Castle was built in 1017 and was destroyed
by CKVMwdl." The wretched boy had evidently started oft
again, the words he uttered having no meaning for him. The
circle completed, he went on, like the donkey going round and
round in the track drawing water from a well.
"Drop a penny in the slot," said SAHK.
So tho boy's mouth being at the moment wide open, stuffed
with details "about Mother SHIPTON, I inserted twopence. He
snapped his chops to secure it, and, en route, to Westminster,
where to-morrow the new Session opens, we went on to see the
cave where EUUENE ARAM murdered HOUSEMAN.
HOW-DAH THEY?—The "Elephant and Castle" is threatened

MUT SBNOR Mio,— Unto the Campos

news from my country come more quickly
than in past days they travelled from Vil-

I receive intelligence of the war in the
island of Cuba. Dion de bondad, que

only I could go there with my faithful

SANCITO would not wish to be governor of

But it is not of this that I write to
your honour, d vwstra me-rced, Senor Don
Punch. There is across the ocean, beyond
the Azores islands, even as far as Cuba, a
certain country discovered by one CRISTO-
BAL COLON, a worthy navigator. This
country is inhabited by a wild and savage
people, the Americanos, ruled by certain
chief men, or senadores, who are called
"jingos" in their barbarous language. The
"jingo" is usually a madman. Volume
Dios! Such is the custom of the country.
And of these wild senadores the greatest is
one Jingo CHANDLER. There is also Jingo
MILLS and Jingo CALL. They are not
caballeros, and therefore I, Don QTJIJOTE DB

errant, despise them. If it could be, I
would send my faithful squire with a stout
cudgel to cure their madness. But he
cannot depart from the Campos Eliseos.
Therefore, Seftor Don Punch, I write
now to your honour these few words of
warning to your country. I hear that
your people love the Americanos, so much
even that they always yield to them; and
would almost kiss their boots, which is not
dignified for a great nation. Do the Ame-

SPORTIVE SONGS.
A Poetic Philosopher, "slumming"{in the East
J£nd, comes upon a reminiscence of a day
Chat has gone for ever.
WHKN all the sky is thick and foul,
And hidden ia the light of day,
When whistles yell and drivers howl,
1 love to wend my silent way
"Mid murky crowds down dirty streets.
Where costers ply their roaring trade,
Where cast-oif garments jostle sweets,
And gin hobnobs with gingerade.
Great flashes, orange, tawny, red,
Break through the gloom with fitful flare,
And swell the curtain overhead,
Eager ita murky folds to share—
In raucous tones the butcher bawls
Of wondrous "bits" of flesh and bone,
Where, heaped upon the reeking stalls,
Is meat most oxen would disown 1
Tho pungent perfume of the fish,
Anointed with some midnight oil.
Blends bravely with the steaming dish
Of whelks or winkles on the boil.
The scent of fruit regales the nose,
The crack of nuts salutes the ear,
And fizzling sausages suppose
Cheap banquets that the poor hold dear.
Yus; all are poor, the poor who live
Only to strive to keep their breath,
And check the water through the sieve
That daily holds the hand of Death.
Mark how their eager gaze will note
This wealth of garbage spread around,
How some lean loon without a coat
Will spend a farthing like a pound!
Food for the mind I also view.
A barrow full of prose and rhyme,
A holocaust of thought once new,
Made aged by the lapse of 'limn.
Names famous joined with those that died
Without a gleam of Fortune's sun—
Yet all successful: side by side
Are SifAK.si'KAiiK and the poet J Ju NN 1
A stout Apostle of the Few,
A votary of pen and ink,
Must to his creed and cult be true,
Though other authors "wheel" and
"rink."
I may not buy the meat that's red,
The winding winkle must refuse,
But some fair book I '11 take instead,
And pay a tribute to the Muse I
This shall be mine—a quarto tome.
That once was gay with gold and green,
An Is'imael that's strayed from home,
Ac two-pence it is cheap. I ween.
I open it—my eyes grow dim—
My famous drama, Oolden Crest!—
Unacted, yet inscribed, "From him
to Her he always witt love best."
On the District Railway.
THK MACTAVTSH enters a compartment
at the unholy hour of 9 A.M., and is
greeted with a chorus of, "Hallo! what
brings you out so early?" Replies the
exiled chieftain, "I 'm bound to put in an
appearance at the Auld Baillie." General
silence, and search of newspaper informa-
tion. "The while," continues the Laird,
"I 'm summoned on the Grand Jury, and
by St. Andrew! wud I 'd to find true bills
against every fause chiel in this same rail-
way machine!"
The MxcTAVisn's wrath is only appeased
by the provident discovery on the part of
one of the doomed passengers of a flask of

A BIRD STORY.
HE AH SIR,—We_ possess a jackdaw
named Jock, who is accomplished in all
the tricks or his tribe. This amusing old
fellow has recently shown a startling proof
of intelligence. He had been distinctly
seedy for some time, and we hardly knew
what to do for him. Little did we guess
his own resourcefulness! My wife takes
"Carper's Little Liver Pills, and missed
a box from the shelf where she is accus-
tomed to place them. As Jock is a star of
the first magnitude in purloining trifles, we
suspected him, and, sure enough, caught
him in the very act of taking two of the
pills. Feeling that the creature's reason-
ing faculty (I dislike the word instinct!)
was a sure guide in the matter, we fur-
nished him with three more boxes of pills.
I feel quite satisfied myself that he took
them regularly according to the directions,
as he is now in perfect health,
\ours always, A. JAY.

Will curtail the many solos of the judges.

WHOSE FAULT?
"HK CAX JUMP BUT HE ITOV'r.1
FROM A CLERICAL DIARY.
December 26, 10 A.M.—Must work hard at the January number
of our Puddleton Parish Magazine this morning. Horrid nui-
sance, especially as I had wanted to get away for a short holiday
after my hard work at Christmas. The average circulation of the
magazine is only about seventy-five, and there is invariably a
deficit on it for the year, which I have to pay. At the same
time, perhaps it would hardly be wise to discontinue its appear-
ance. How on earth am 1 to fill the two pages of "local
matter"? Well, anyhow, I must try.
11.30.—Had just begun, by wishing my parishioners a Happy
New Year, coupled with the hope that they would support our
Blanket Club better, when young HARRY TOMLINSON came in.
HARRT lives in London, where, according to his own account, he
works as a journalist, though I never could discover to what
papers he contributed. He is staying with his father, our village
doctor, for Christmas, and came to pay his respects to me. I
was obliged to tell him that I was busy, and explained the nature
of my occupation. In the most good-natured way, he offered
to relieve me of my work. "Seventy-five copies a month!" he
exclaimed, when I had told him about the magazine; "why, if
you '11 let me run the thing for a time, I '11 multiply the circula-
tion by ten!" Doubtless he is over-sanguine, but still, as a
journalist, he knows far more about these matters than myself.
Accordingly. I have handed over to him a report of the school
treat, and the figures of the offertories (sadly low, as usual) for
the last month, and asked him to urge the duty of liberal giving
upon our readers, beside making the magazine as attractive in
other ways as possible. "Don't fret yourself, old cock," were
his parting words. "I '11 make the thing simply hum I" HARRT
is rather given to slang, I fear, but undeniably he has a kind
heart. I start on my holiday to Eastbourne this afternoon.
Easttxrurnf, January 1.—-HARRY'S confidence in himself was
not misplaced, after all. Early this afternoon I received a tele-
gram from our Puddleton stationer, which ran: "Whole edition
(150) of magazine sold out. Orders for two hundred more
Shall we reprint?" Of course I answered, "Yes." What a ta-
lent that young man must have! Feel quite anxious to see the
magazine. With a sale, say, of three hundred a month, it will
bring us in a nice little profit at the end of the year.
: January 2.—Most astounding and unpleasant letters from
home this morning—all abusing me fiercely on account of the
magazine, and several of them saying that actions for libel would
be brought against me. What can have happened? Must re-
turn home at once.
Later.—I can hardly hold a pen for indignation. That young
scoundrel has ruined me! The magazine consists of a string of
offensive personalities. Here are a few of the paragraphs in it: —
"The offertories were very low last month. We may inform
Mrs. MIGSON that, in spite of her attempt to conceal the coin in
her glove, we are quite aware that it is a penny, and not a half-
crown, which forms her weekly contribution. Even if she wants
more of her money to defray her wine-merchant's bill, she ought
to give more than this."
»»***»
"Remarkable event! Our readers who were not in church on
Christmas Day will hardly believe us when we say that Mr.
Drxox wore a really clean cottar on that occasion. Such extra-
vagance on his part is, we believe, quite without precedent. As
he is in a reforming mood, why doesn't he give his wife a new
wig? Her present one is very ugly, and wouldn't deceive a cow."
• *****
"Miss LAVINIA JOHNSON (whose real age, let it be known, is
forty-five, if it's a day) was again escorted home on Sunday by
Captain PECKHAM. Fie, fii, LAVINIA! Remember we have our
eve upon you 1"
* * * * * *
"The Lord Bishop of the Diocese will preach in the parish
church on January 24. We strongly recommend all sufferers
from insomnia to be present on this occasion. His Lordshin's
sermons have been known to cure the most obstinate cases. By
the way, why doesn't his Lordship pad hit calves?"
January 4.—When I called on the perpetrator of these out-
rages, he had the effrontery to say that he had only carried out
my wishes by making the magazine readable, and by increasing
its circulation. This only could be done, he added, by imparting
a flavour of the New Journalism to it, which he had accordingly
givpn it.
This morning's post brought me a letter from my patron,
suggesting that I should resign the living at once, and another
from the Bishop, asking for an immediate interview.

ELIZA mine—fast flow my tepid tears—
Thou pride of my tonsorial delight!
What cruel fate that both our young
careers
A callous parent should attempt to
blight!
Wild thoughts of murder wander through
my head,
Fierce indignation thrills me to the core,
As thou to me art permanently dead,
Revenge is what I ask, and nothing
more!
So, when thy father comes some sunny
morn
From his secluded and suburban home,
To have his scanty tresses deftly shorn
And seek the soft shampoo's alluring
foam,
Then shall my fury long controlled out-
burst.
Then shall the vials of my wrath o'erflow
In one resistless stream—but not at first—
Some method in my madness I will
show.
With smile polite and expectation bland,
As is my wont, my victim I will greet.
And with a tender, yet remorseless nand
I'll tuck him tightly in the wooden
seat;
But—though his garment I arrange with
care—
No pad of cotton-wool I'll place to
check
The constant falling of his withered hair
In irritating fashion down his neck.
With ghastly glee his hirsute growth I '11
trim
In manner diabolically planned,
So that for weeks 'twill be a curse to him.
And straight on end persistently will
stand;

Then in the basin, stern and uncontrolled,
His head I '11 plunge—he is but half my
size—
The water shall be very, very cold,
And all the soap shall get into his eyes.
Next the machine brush in its circling
course
Shall give expression to my deadly hate,
What joy to use it with resistless force
Upon the much-abhorred paternal pate I
The whirr of busy wheels shall sound aloft,
From my revenge I will not be debarred,
And though your father's voice may ask
for "soft,"
I certainly intend to give him "hard."
And then—ah! happy thought—while still
he squirms
And 'neath the brush each tender
temple smarts,
I '11 ask him, and in strong, expressive
terms,
If be intends to break two loving hearts;
Resistance will be absolutely vain,
And as his hair I frantically frizz,
I shall be hoping soon to see again

Proctor's wooing generally occurs after the

HKAR the Yahoos with their yells—
Raucous yells I
Of what a world of Bumbledom their
blatant blaring tells!
How they bellow, bellow, bellow,
On the humid air of night!
While each girl, in red and yellow,
Shrieks and capers with her "fellow,"
In sheer lunatic delight;
Keeping time, time, time,
In their trampings through the slime.
With coarse Cockney cachinnation, which
unmusically swells
From their Maenad-like emission of wild
yells, yells, yells—
The roaring, loud outpouring of mad yells!
Hear the bellowing minstrel's yells—
Brazen yells!—
What a world of savagery their toneless
tumult tells 1
Through the darkness or the light,
How they ring out day and night!
From the brazen, blatant notes,
All out of tune!
What a dismal ditty floats
From the family with rough and loopy
throats—
Blessed boon!—
Oh, from throttles like cracked bells,
What a gush cacophonous voluminously
wells!
How it swells!
How it dwells
On split top-notes! How it tells
Of the asthma that impels

Of the shrill, harsh, inharmonious, husky,

Hear the clamorous coster yells—
Strident yells!—
What a tale of throats inflamed their tur-

In our ears, by day and night,
How they shriek to our affright I
Too much scarified to speak,
They can only shriek, shriek
Out of tune,
In a clamorous appeal to the attention of
the buyer,
In a mad expostulation with the heedless
should-be buyer,
Rising higher, higher, higher,
With a desperate desire,
And a resolute endeavour,
Now—now to sell, or never,
To the pale-faced throngs who moon!
Oh, the yells, yells, yells I
What a tale their chorus tells
Of despair!
How they rattle, rush, and roar I
What a horror they outpour
On the bosom of the moist malodorous air!
Yet the ear it fully knows,
By the twanging
And the slanging,
How the custom ebbs and flows;
Yet the ear distinctly tells,
By the patter,
And the clatter,
How the bidding sinks and swells,
By the sinking or the swelling in the
shindy of the yells,
Of those yells—
Of the coarse, hoarse, blaring, tearing,
croaking, clamorous coster

Hear the yowling of the yells—
Newsboy yells!
What a world or eager heed their bellow-

In the gas-glare of the night,
How we shiver with affright
At the melancholy menace of their tone!
For every sound that floats
From those husky urchin throats
Brings a groan.
And the nippers—ah! those nippers—
Those shrill shouters, those swift skippers,
"On their own!"
And who, howling, howling, howling,
In that ear-tormenting tone,
Scare the buffer homeward prowling
O'er the slippery, slithery stone—
They are neither man nor woman—
They are simply subterhuman
Gutter-ghouls:
And each urchin yahoo yowls,
As he howls, howls, howls,
Howls,
"Hextry-spethuini" And he yells,
And his impish bosom swells
With the ranture of his veils,
D<*mon-dancing as he yells
The last horror of the time
In a sort of Runic chime.
"Orl the winners, Kir!" he yells.
How he yells!!!

With the latest "Orful crime!"
Oh! the nuisance of those yells,

Tipsy cads and roystering swells!—
Shrieking women smeared with slime !—

THB OLD ORDER CHANGBTH. — Mrs.
TFACKKRAY RITCHIE says, "The literature
of the lower Self is all the vogue just
now." That dainty and delightful writer
is right, and the name she gives it is an
apt one. But is it wn; different from what
used to be called "the literature of the
Upper Shelf?" The main change seems
to be that what were once known as "Gen-
tlemen's Books" are now "written bv
ladies for ladies" and read onenly by all.
The new way, like the New Woman, who
has opened it up, seems hardly an im-
provement on the old.
IBSEN UP TO DATE. — According to the
Humanitarian, the gloomy playwright
IBSEN describes Christiania as 'the most

there, and he ought to know. Should he
emigrate, would the morals of the Nor-
wegian town be improved?

PRESENT—Examiner and two Aspirants for selection.
Examiner. And now, gentlemen, I will just ask you a question
or two about your physical training. Were you either or both
or neither in the Volunteer Cadet Corps at your college?
First Aspirant. No; Sir, I did not care very much about drill.
Second Asp. Yes, Sir, I was advanced from private to corporal,
and then from sergeant to lieutenant.
Exam, (taking notes). I see. How about shooting?
First Asp. Never tried, Sir. Fact is, not exactly in my line.
Second Asp. I have won a heap of prizes at Bisley, and made
the highest possible frequently.
Exam, (as before). I see. Done anything in football or cricket?
First Asp. No, Sir. I prefer study to that sort of thing.
.Second Asp. Captain of the fifteen and the eleven when I was
at school.
Exam, (same business). I see. And now how about swimming
and horsemanship P
First Asp. Again, Sir, I am rather out of it. But dare say
I could manage both if I tried.
Second Asp. Hold the Albert Medal, Sir, for saving the life of
a little chap who tumbled overboard mid Channel, and was ac-
customed to horses long before I got into Eton jackets.
Exam, (as tiefore). Yes. And about athleticSj generally P
First Asp. Bather weak in them, I am afraid, Sir. Doctor

Second Asp. Haven't got that excuse. Sir. I am as hard as

j-.unt before breakfast.
Exam, (closing note-book). I see. Well, No. 2 has come out
very well, but as No. 1 has answered three dates more than his
competitor, and, as there is only one vacancy, I fear I must pass
him and refuse the other.
First Asp. Thank you, Sir. I 'm greatly obliged to you.

SOIMGS AND THEIR SINGERS. No. VI.
ROUNDABOUT READINGS.
(Afr. Hubert Rmmdabout to his Sister-in-law.}
No. VII.—OF LETTERS—OF BREAKFASTS AND THEIR EATERS—Or A
CHILDREN'S PARTY—OF JACK HORNER—OF THINKING.
MY DEAR Lucr,—JACK has been good enough to undertake to
hand you this letter before he leaves you to-morrow on his re-
turn to Cambridge. I admit that this method of postage is not
too safe, letters having the most fatal facility for clinging to
coat pockets long after they should have been delivered. Still,
sooner or later you will receive it, even if JACK, as will probably
be the case, has to post it to you from Cambridge. I send JACK
back to you, as I received him, in first-rate health, a much-im-
proved shot and a most vigorous wielder of his knife and fork.
Indeed I might have contented myself with invoicing him to
you in the terms of trade, as for example thus:—Madam, in
accordance with your obliging order, I have to-day despatched
to your address, by rail, One Boy, containing, in addition to the
usual articles, one large sole (fried), two mutton-cutlets, two
sausages on mashed potatoes, two poached eggs, toast, butter,
marmalade, and two breakfast-cups of best Chinese tea. I trust
the parcel will arrive in good condition and give satisfaction.
Hoping to be favoured with a continuance of your esteemed
commands, I beg to remain, Madam, your obedient servant,
&c., &c. This, my dear LtrcY, is no exaggeration. I am
telling you the plain and simple truth about your astonishing
boy's breakfast this morning. Your own experience will con-
vince you of my veracity. Oh, happy time of boyhood, dura
puf.rorum ilia (JACK will construe), now far off appear the days
when I too thought nothing of such a breakfast, nay, when I could
top up with deep draughts of beer from the mighty three-handled
tankard that circulated from hand to hand after our undergradu-
ate (easts. I don't know how it is, but it is a fact that men of
my age lose the tremendous gusto for breakfasts that inspires
the young to these feats. We dally with a kipper or toy with a
boiled egg, and are glad to get the meal over in a dyspeptic
hurry while the youngsters are still engaged on the second of
the four or five courses into which they divide it.
It was very good of you to lend me the boy for a few days,
and I can assure you 1 enjoyed his visit very much. He 's a
fine, manly, straightforward lad, fresh, breezy, and unaffected,
and, as for looks, he is just the counterpart of what his dear
father was in the old days, not an Apollo, but something far
better, an open-faced, clean-complexioned, bright-eyed, and
crisp-haired English youth. And they all liked him. Old CAR-
RUTHERS, who, a.s you know, was once in the ministry, and still
retains that air of portentous mystery which goes with the
possession of secret* de Polichinelle, even he relaxed under JACK'S
influence, and was good enough to smile at some of the boy's
undergraduate stories, and to flavour them afterwards with some
reminiscences of his own days at Cambridge. Nor was JACK in-
attentive to the fair. Miss CARRUTHERS—she 's a pretty little
touzled fair girl, with an attractive nwue—has no reason to com-
plain of the way in which JACK helped her over various fences
when she came out with the other ladies to the shooting lunch,
or of his readiness to turn over the leaves of the drawing-room
ballads with which she softened our manners nor allowed them
to be savage after dinner. In a word, he's a good boy, and
though your gentle mind hates the idea of killing, I must tell
you that the way in which he pulled down some of my tallest
pheasants in Parson's Grove left nothing to be desired. Even
the veteran CARRUTHERS, who has missed rocketers with glorious
certainty through more than twenty seasons was good enough
to say that if JACK went on like that he would make a shot—in
time, and approbation from CARRUTHERS is praise indeed. And
the boy was just as good, and played his little part with the
same simple good nature all through. We all went to a pretty
children's party at the HARDYS', not far from here. They had
secured him for one of the tableaux—" Cinderella and the Pnnce"
—and I can assure you he made a most excellent Prince, and
showed a princely grace in his kneeling position at the fair
Cinderella's feet. And when the children came on and
acted their fairy-stories, finally dancing round JACK, who was
robed in a huge fur coat and beard to represent a captured
giant, the applause and enthusiasm were deafening. But the
hero of the performance was SEBASTIAN HARDY, aged three-and-
a-half. To this promising actor the part of Jack Horner had
been allotted, bis duty being to dance gaily on to the stage
holding a dish in his hand, to put in his diminutive thumb, to pull
out an imaginary plum and devour it with the self-appreciative joy
associated with his character. When his turn came, SEBASTIAN,
who is but lately out of frocks and into shorts, danced on, but
forgot the extraction of the plum. A second performance of the
whole series having been called for by the audience, SEBASTIAN
appeared again, and on this occasion went through the thumb
and plum part with a conscientious gravity that moved us all to
fits of laughter. This, however, offended the actor, for when he
was brought round to the front of the house and placed in his
mother's arms he complained loudly that " When I corned on the
first time and forgot my plum nobody laughed, but when I
corned on again and put in my thumb, jus as uncle SYDNEY
told me, everybody laughed." Afterwards, SEBASTIAN honoured
me by sitting on my knee. The Sandman had strewed his little
eyes with dust, but the boy had a fine spirit, and being deter-
mined to see the performance out would not yield to sleep.
So I told him I knew he wanted to think—that all grown-up
people always thought at this particular hour, and he ought not
to be an exception. "How shall I think?" he asked. "Close
your eyes very tight," I said; "we always close our eyes when
we think." Whereupon his eyelids dropped, and in half a
minute the little fellow was asleep in my arms. I often wish I
could think like that.
Good-bye, my dear LUCY, I hear the dog-cart coming up the
drive for JACK, so I close this letter with all good wishes, and
remain now, as always, Your affectionate brother, BOB.
An Involuntary Truth.
Old Female (to Member of Anti-gambling League). Yes, Sir,
I'm 'eartily one with you. It aint the 'urdles, or the "edges, or
the other hobstacles that I hobjecta to, but, as my pore 'usband
used to say, "It's the hun'appy 'osses wot breaks their backers."
ORNITHOLOGICAL.—It is stated that pigeons frequent the great
London fish-market. Surely, therefore, its name ought to be
changed to Cooing-and-Billings-gate.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SAUCE FOR THE GANDER.
A SCHEME has been laid before Mr. Punch for an agency
wbich is evidently intended to operate in friendly rivalry with
one referred to—we regret to say, in sadly unsympathetic terms
—by the Daily Chronicle, and established to conduct "Smart
Society" on "Night Tours through Whitechapel and Darkest
London."
The Rival Undertaking is based on somewhat similar lines, as
will be seen from the preliminary advertisement submitted to
Mr. Punch, to which he has much pleasure in giving publicity in
these columns: —
THE WEST-END EXPLORATION AGENCY, Li>.
Head Office, Second Floor Front, Three Colts Larte, Beihnal Onen, E. C.
branch Agencies at WtvU.Kho.ptl, Poplar, Limehouse, <ix.
This Association has been formed for the purpose of organising
Night Tours through Belgravia and Lightest London, and there-
by affording Members of the Industrial Classes an opportunity
of exploring, under experienced guidance and in perfect safety,
those parts of the West £nd to which access has been hitherto
either impossible or attended by considerable risk.
On application to any of the agencies, and payment of a small
fee per head, parties desiring to make the tour will be personally
conducted by competent guides, specially selected for their
knowledge of West End purlieus, and their intimate acquaint-
ance with members of the "Exposed Tenth."
Arrangements have been entered into whereby tourists will be
enabled to penetrate to the inmost recesses of certain Pall Mall
Clubs, the mere thresholds of which have never before been
crossed by the most enterprising outsider, and it is confidently
anticipated that the appalling spectacles which may be beheld
during a brief inspection of such notorious haunts as the "Athe-
naeum," "Reform," "Oxford and Cambridge," and "Brooks's"
Clubs will surpass the most vivid and UiriUing descriptioas of
Socialist Orators and Feminine Novelists!
Excursionists may, should they desire it, enter into conversa-
tions with various members of a population composed almost
entirely of Habitual Ecclesiastics, Legislators, Officers of both
Services, Casual and Professional Litterateurs, and Artists, who,
if civilly interrogated, may be expected to furnish invaluable
information as to their earnings, occupations, morals, and man-
ner of life generally.
As a rule, the most irreclaimable aristocrats will be found
perfectly tractable; provided they are given to understand that
they are the subjects—not of idle curiosity, but—of genuine
interest and sympathy. Some caution, however, should be ob-
served in localities known to be frequented by Bishops, and it
is distinctly unsafe to make advances to a Retired Admiral,
unless with the sanction of the Conductor.
Flying visits will be paid to Smart Dinner Parties, from which
the Tourist will carry away an ineffaceable impression of the
Torpid Satiety that may almost be said to be the chronic condi-
tion of the Upper Classes.
Typical "Balls" and "Crushes" will be prominent features
in each excursion, affording as they do Ghastly Examples of the
terrible overcrowding, insufficient clothing, and imperfect venti-
lation, in which so many uncomplaining sufferers are compelled
to pursue their sole means of enjoyment 1
Facilities have been afforded for the inspection, during any
time of the Day or Night, of the most Fashionable Hotels by
Parties accompanied by a Conductor, who will be empowered to
take them over the various Eating Rooms and Dormitories,
whether occupied or otherwise.
Lady inhabitants of the East End wishing to see this neighbour-
hood can be conducted round during the day, and see their jaded
and overworked sisters of the West End engaged in their unremit-
ting toil of " driving," "calling," " leaving cards," "bazaar-hold-
ing," and other equally arduous and poorly-remunerated occu-
pations.
Owing, however, to the condition of some of the chief West
End thoroughfares, under no circumstances can Ladies be per-
mitted to join the Night Tours.
Male East Enders, if suitably attired (rabbit-skin caps and
"pearlies " must not be worn). need apprehend no danger at any
time, provided they remain close to their conductor, and follow
his advice in all emergencies.
In conclusion, the Organisers venture to express their san-
guine expectation that these Tours will prove not only popular,
but of inestimable benefit to the community at large, tending,
as they must, to promote mutual goodwill by encouraging closer
intercourse between the Masses and the Classes, and enabling
the most thoughtless Son of Toil to realise for himself the de-
pressing monotony and triviality of the existence to which
Fashion's merciless decree condemns her countless thousands of
White Slaves I And so says Mr. Punch.

He unfortunately forgets to mention the paper from which' it IB

the opinion that it is the War Cry.—
THE CAPTURE OF HAWARDEN
is by this time matter of history. Everyone knows how the
(ieneral approached the Castle single-handed, and how, after a
short but brilliant attack, he forced the garrison to capitulate.
But how complete the victory was, comparatively few have
realised. Not a single newspaper, so far as we are aware, hns
taken any notice of tne fact that, before the General left the field,
MR. GLADSTONE WAS GAZETTED CORPORAL.
Since then, ajl has been activity at Hawarden. The Castle has
been turned into barracks, and: the library into a doss-house.
The Corporal is indefatigable. He is already known as "Hot
and Strong WILLIAM." He is saving souls by the thousand, and
recruits are pouring in so fast that twenty orderlies are busy
night and day taking down their names. On Sunday last
A GRAND PARADE
was held on the lawn, when the Corporal for the first time wore
his uniform. It would be madness to attempt to describe the
enthusiasm of the meeting. Never was such singing heard as
when the Corporal led off the Army, marching backwards, and
beating time with both hands. But the climax was reached
when the hymn was ended, and the Corporal called a halt.
"Attention!" he cried, in his well-known silvery voice, which
rang clear and distinct to the uttermost rank of that huge
armament. "Now then, are you ready?

A VERY PRETTY DAKCE.
DEAR OLD PUNCH,—Just before I start
for old BIRCH, who has told my parents
that he will be "glad to see his young
friends" this afternoon as ever is, just let
mo give you a suggestion. When I get
back to my beastly school, there won't be
much chance for me to write to any old
friend like you. There will be the regu-
lation note to the Pater, when it isn't
addressed to the Mater. And we can't say
much in that.
What I want to tell you is that we have
had a very good time of it these holidays
My brother and I have been to heaps of
dances, and wherever we have gone, we
have found "The Washington Post." Do
you know how to dance it? We do. You
take hold of a girl by both hands, try a
double shuffle, and then slide off to another
part of the room and repeat the perform-
ance. It's great fun, and far better than
the Barn Dance. It knocks Sir Roger de
Coverley into fits.
This is what I suggest—and BROWN
MAJOR says it would be first-rate—add to
the double shuffle a Highland fling and the
old hop waltz, and the dance would be
twice as jolly. Then when you were stand-
ing out, you might keep up the fun by
lumping about in time to the music until
you were ready to begin again. If that
wouldn t bring down the house (as thev
say at the theatres), I don't know what
^roul(l. And now, dear old Punch, I must
up, as I'm off to BIRCH'S. Tips

lings, and four pence. Not so bad in these
n.ird times. En, old man?

SPOET1VE SONGS.
An old and not yet extinguished Admirer writes

I 'M writing to you, love, by night.
The house is hushed, the gas turned out
My candle's solitary light
Proclaims the darkness it would flout.
The fire with ill-conditioned heat
Has just demanded copious coal;
I 've got a feeling in my teet
That tells my slippers' want of sole I
And yet I write, because I know
To-morrow will your birthday be.
In memory of long ago
You will expect a kne from me!
A little scrawl to bid you wealth,
And health, and happiness, and joy,
The wishes that we made by stealth
When you were girl and I was boy I
I wish them I Are you satisfied
To find I still am true in heart,
Or mourn the vow you once denied
In order we might ever part?
No matter! Still I picture you
An angel in a village church;
Your eyes and bonnet both were blue,
And left confession in the lurch!
Yesl there demure and even prim,
You drove my mind to earthly things,
Yet, as 1 Ve said, an angel slim,
You only needed little wings.
And so to-day again I went
To that same church where first we met.
Ah I then I knew the Love you lent,
But gave it with the curse Regret!
Days upon days, and years on years,
Have swiftly come and slowly gone I
We travel through the Vale of Tears
Wide separated and alone I
But still, whatever be our fate,
I yearly wander to the shrine
Where once—I need not give the date
I knew your prayers were wholly mine I
And so to-night accept this leaf
Culled from the pocket-book of Time,
Who may not play the part of thief
In this our lifelong pantomime.
I climbed the Mountains of the Moon,
And fell.—Why should I thus repine P

But you, are still a Columbine!

A SUGGESTION.
(For Frozen-out Foxhunters and their Idle Studs, if the Winter is setting in now.)
THE CENTENARY OF THE TOP-HAT.
Introduced at the beginning of January, 1797.
(Some Suggestions for its Celebration.)
ITS instant and universal discontinuance.
The erection of a statue of the inventor
in every market town of the United King-
dom, wearing a topper, in white marble.
This will serve as an object lesson in in-
artistic incongruity for future generations.
A general distribution of existing speci-
mens of this headgear among necessitous
and deserving scarecrows throughout the
country.
A grand parade and march past of guys,
attired with the surplus stock of silk hats
now lying in London warehouses.
A short Act to be passed through Par-
liament at an early date this Session, con-
signing the manufacturers to Hanwell, in
accordance with the popular opinion ex-
pressed in the phrase, "As mad as a
hatter."
Football players, like the cricketers of
fifty years ago, to wear it on ail possible
occasions, viz., before, during, and after
a match. The Eugby game, with one con-
tinuous "scrum," to be encouraged with
this object, but Association players may be
permitted to substitute a topper, or suc-
cession of toppers (preferably obtained
from the onlookers), in lieu of the ordi-
nary leather football. A "free kick" to
be given to any person objecting.
Its compulsory adoption by "gutter-
snipes," bicyclists, bargees, freshmen
(when wearing their gowns), burglars (on
and off duty), port^admirals, commanders-
in-chief, tennis-players, telegraph-boys
heralds, Kings-at-arms, beef-eaters, High-
landers, sea-cooks and their eldest sons ii
the male line, tide-waiters, mudlarks, Lore
Mayors in their pride, bishops in full ca-
nonicals, hangmen in full swing, freemasons
in full fig, 'Arries in full force on a Derby
day, Tommy Atkins in full war-paint, the
lorse-marines in full charge, and by other
inappropriate classes of the community.
Its simultaneous use by such conspicuous
ndividuals as the foregoing will thus prove
3qually surprising and ridiculous, and
should result in its speedy disappearance.
A Centennial Ode in its honour, with a
prize of one hundred guineas, to be com-
peted for by the praiseworthy gentlemen
who versify for So-and-so's pills or for
Thingamy's soap. The winning composi-
tion to be printed on the leader page of
every daily paper (not among the adver-
tisements). This should have a similar
effect to the previous suggestion.
The prompt elevation of every Member of
Parliament who sits on his own, or, better,
another Member's hat, to " another place.'
Quite a respectable number of stove-pipes
(not "wind-bags") can thus be daily sat
upon, and snuffed out and extinguished.
A poll-tax on members of the Stock Ex-
change, undertakers, coachmen, "John-
nies, and other persons who would die
rather than be seen without a topper.
The general imitation of the Christ's
Hospital head-dress, since no satisfactory
covering appears to be before the public.
The abolition of the custom of raising
the hat to ladies, which is ruination to the
brim.
The abolition of 'busses, which are re-
sponsible for the "bashing" of the vast
majority of " cylinders."
The abolition of weddings, where they
am de rigueur; ditto, ditto of Church Pa-
rade and Piccadilly.
The abolition of the English climate, so
destructive of the silk integument.
The abolition of artists, who, as is gene-
rally the case, come a cropper when at-
tempting to draw its difficult curves.
Or, lastly, and best of all, the universal
ntroduction of the most becoming, ser-
viceable and comfortable form of head-
gear, to wit, Mr. Punch's cap. with stripes
and turned-up brim, and, like the great
Panjandrum, with the little button on top.
Ladies may adopt Toby's hat and feather.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
i.KTKACTKU FROM TUB DlAKY OF Toll*, M.I'.
House of Commons. Tuesday, Jan. 19.—
In accordance with formal notice and or-
dered usage, Parliament met to-day for
lie third Session of the fourteenth Parlia-
ment of the QUEEN. Actually, Session
opened last night at Devonshire House,
where the Duchess was "at home." Earlier
there were the Ministerial dinners. On
he other side of the hedge Spencer
Bouse, which will conveniently hold the
Full muster of Liberal Peers, was hospi-
tably open, whilst the SQUIUB OP MALWOOD
entertained his colleagues of the Commons
in the dining-room on Richmond Terrace,
where last year, according to his cheerful
custom, Lord ONSLOW, le vrai Amphitryon,
gave his Tuesday dinners. All the Minis-
ters, and some ex-Ministers, met later at
Devonshire House, adding to the bril-
liancy of the throng the distinction of
their uniforms.
"Reminds me." says SARK, looking
round the room, his eye glowing as it fell
on the warlike figures of JESSK COLMNGS
and POWELL WILLIAMS with swords girt at
their slim waists and suspicion of horse-
pistols in their coat-tail pockets, "of an-
other famous gathering under thu hospi-
table wine of an earlier but not more
charming Duchess. It was at Brussels,
you know, one night in June eighty-one
years ago. Wonder whether we shall have
Waterloo to follow?"
Plenty of good stories going round,
echoes from the several dinner tables.
The best is coupled with the name of
Lord RATHMORB, even yet better known
as our dear DAVID PMTNKET of the Com-
mons, whose appropriation by the House
of Lords did more than anything since
thev threw out the Compensation for Dis-
turbance Bill to aggravate the other
House. RATHMORE, tbough in full dress
like the rest of the Premier's guests,
didn't woar his sword. Many genial in-
quiries why.
"Oh !" said the BURLBIOH BALFOUR. "in
the present overtaxed condition of Ireland,
he feels he cannot afford the luxury of a
sword."
"Do you mean to imply," said RA_TH-
MORE, "that I have temporarily deposited
the weapon with my Financial Relation?"
That was last night. But ancient usage
must be observed. It demands formal
opening of Parliament, with Lords Com-
missioners on Woolsack before Throne, a
Queen's speech read, mover and seconder
sporting their uniforms, the Leaders from
either side of the table crossing swords
above it. All this dulv took place to-day
in more than ordinary humdrum fashion.
Only for JEMMY LOWTHER, scene and
proceedings would have been hopelessly
flat. Man and boy, with few intermissions
arbitrarily enforced by ungrateful consti-
tuents, JEMMT has for thirty-two years sat
and listened on opening days of revolving
Session to recitation of ancient sessional
orders coming down from Cromwellian
ages. No one savs "Aye" or "No " when
question is put from Chair that these be
re-affirmed. Nobody listens. If by chance
SPEAKER, forgot the formula, few woulc
notice. To-day slumber of thirty-five
years broken. On JEMMT LOWTHEH'S
quickenpd ear strikes voico of SPEAKER
submitting rule prohibiting Peers from in-
terfering in Parliamentary elections. They
do so overtly and covertly, and if it please
them, what can the House of Commons do
to stop them P Nothing. Then why this

Conttable R-ch-rd W-btt-r Al. "Well, gents, You 're a breakin' o' the law as 'ard ae ever you can
(to, and you want a hact o' Parliament to put you right! Thank you, gents; 'ere 's your very good
'™ltlie and a 'Appy New Year!"
JEMMY first puts question to himself; come to-day. But another House of Corn-
then, in gravest manner, with that judicial mons anachronism is doomed. They have
air that at critical epoch saved the Jockey this day lit a candle that will burn up these
Club, submits it to conscience of awakened j dust-dried sessional orders."
Business done.—Session opened.
Thursday.—Things have come to pretty
pass with the mother of Parliaments. It
appears that for more than half a century
House of Commons been nothing loss than
House. He even takes a division, and
though overwhelmed by numbers, knows
he is right, and that right will prevail.
"Don't know how it is," said J. G.
TALBOT, brushing away a consecrated tear,
"but when I listened to JEMMY LOWTHER
iust now, and saw TOMMY BOWLES rally to
his side to lead the forlorn hope into the
lobby, I recalled the lust scene by a Smith-
field fire. You remember how, when the
executioners placed a live faggot at RID-
LEY'S feet bound to the stake, LATIMER
said, 'Be of good comfort, Master BOWLES
—I mean Master RIDLEY—and play the
man. We shall this day light such a candle
in England as I trust shall never be put
out.' So JEMMY to TOMMY. They are over-
an unlicensed public-house! WILFRID
LAWSON long suspected it. To-night his
fears publicly confirmed upon no less au-
thority than that of ATTORNEY-GENERAL.
That learned man says short Act must be
brought in to put matters right.
That all very well, but what are we to do
in the meantime P and what about the in-
numerable breaches of the law in the past?

J-mmy L-wth-r. "Now'then, you]old dummy, we "ve had enough of you!"
elapse before it's added to Statute Book.
Any night we are liable to a raid of police,
and may find ourselves taking part in a
morning sitting in Westminster Police
Court.
Incident quite demoralised House on
eve of Session. The Peers have meanly
evaded their share of responsibility by
putting up the shutters, and going off
home for a week. This is under pretence
that they have no work to do, "and," says
the MAKKISM, "I do not know that any
support is given to the constitution by our
coming here without business." Having
nothing to do is the normal condition of
the Lords through the greater part of the
average Session. What they really mean
by this movement is to stand off and see
what line the police will take. If they
follow the ordinary course in similar cir-
cumstances, and swoop down on premises
where liquor is sold without a license, at
least they shall pick up no prizes in the
persons of Peers of the Realm.
In the Commons, the attendance is very
small; probably same motive that moves
the Peers operates in individual cases.
An Irish debate on, but quite impossible
to get up any excitement. Members come
and go, entering the House timidly, re-
tirinc; stealthilv, startled at shadow of
the familiar policeman in the lobby. The
demoralisation may only prove temporary.
It is certainly complete. The worst that
could happen would be better than ttis
haunting, harrassing dread.
Business done.—Debate on the Address.
Friday. — Hardly anything been seen
since Session opened of JOHN o' GORST,
time-bonoured Educationalist. Has. I am
told, though I haven't Been him, looked in
for a few moments. Certainly has not
shown ungovernable disposition to comfort
bv his companionship his colleagues on
Treasury Bench.
Fresh effort being made bv Government
to pass Education Bill. Reasonable to
suppose that the Education Minister
would, as last year, have charge of it.
"Instead of which," PRINCE ARTHUB takes
it in hand, and JOHN o' GORST has no
more to do than if he were a Peer.
"Have you any idea where GORST is?"
I asked PRINCE ARTHUR, meeting him in
the corridor just now.
"Yes," he said, with a smile childlike
and more than usually bland. "I fancy
he's at home, drawing up amendments to
my Education Bill."
This was early in sitting. Later the
childlike smile was chased away, scorched
under the Jove-like frown. The summer
sky swept by angry blast. Never saw
PRINCB ARTHUR in such tantrums; and it
was all HBNRT HOWORTH.
Who but must laugh if such a man there be;
Who would not weep if Atticua were he r
Yes, it was ATTICUS of Printing House
Square—ATTICUS, at whose feet the na-
tions are wont to sit when he is pleased to
instruct them in the correspondence co-
lumns of the Times; ATTICUS, confounded
by the certainly singular coincidence of
serious indisposition amongst dynamitards
closely corresponding with access of Con-
servatives to office and introduction of
Irish Land Bill, a sudden epidemic that
made their release by HOME SECRETARY
imperative.
ATTICUS was as philosophical in bis re-
flections, an courteous in his speech, as
benevolent in his bearing as his prototype
ADDISON. Effect on PRINCE ARTHUR all
the more vitriolic. It was a fine display of
fierv indignation; splendid outburst of de-
clamation. But, as SARJC says, it really
hud nothing to do with the gravamen of
HENRY Ho WORTH'S charge.
Hvsinfta done.—Close of first week on
the Address.
CURIOUS FACT. — The person best ac-
quainted with the power of water is a fire-
man.
ILLUMINATION NOT POPULAR IN GER-
MANY.-—Tausch light.
THE VERY LAST OF THE CHANNEL TUNNEL
A ROMANCE OF THE FUTURE.
THE tempest was at its worst. The
waves ran mountains high, and the wind
shrieked through the rigging. The
Premier was prostrate in his state cabin.
But, in spite of all this, a mysterious
stranger stood beside him holding a docu-
ment for which he requested his signature.
"Never," murmured the minister, feebly.
"Never I1'
"But see, the weather gets more terrible
with every moment. Sign this, and I will
warrant that you will never again have so
sad an experience."
"I will not sign," continued the Pre-
mier, feebly. "Do you not observe that I
have not strength to do so."
"But I will guide your fingers," said the
tempter, eagerly. "Consider the great
advantage ofa painless journey. Consider
the brilliant advocacy the scheme has re-
ceived at the hands of GLADSTONE, COBDKN,
and many others."
"But I must protect my country from
invasion." gasped out the suffering states-
man. I must be worthy of my race—
my reputation."
At this moment the continually stricken
vessel lurched, which caused a mournful
moan from the wretched servant of the
State.
"Sign! sign I sign!" commanded the evil
genius once more, proffering the fatal pen.
"Spare me!" came from the couch.
"Even the merciless and mercenary ticket-
collector, seeing my hapless condition, li;i-
had pity upon me."
"I have more at stake than the ticket-
collector," retorted the oppressor; "I hare
the future of the peoples of England and
France to take into consideration. I have
my own personal prospects to advance."
"But coal has been discovered in the
Channel." argued the Premier, in a feeble
tone. Even should the tunnel be never
constructed, there will be amnle fuel to be
wrested from the ocoan. This in itself
will make the shareholders wealthy."
But the tempter was obdurate. He
again pressed the pen upon the stricken
one.
"Here you have the pen between your
fineers. Sign I"
The request came too late—the states-
man had fainted!
• • * •
"An excellent likeness I" exclaimed the
Mayor of Dover, as he removed the cover-
ing from the statue, two years later. "He
never got over that passage—he sacrificed
his life to his duty."
And, amidst every mark of respect, a
new monument was added to the already
teeming attractions of the Cinque Ports.
It had on it an inscription that concluded
with the words, "and he saved his country
from invasion bv submitting to the terrors
of the Channel Passage."

DEAR MR. PUNCH,—I have read with much interest in the
papers that Lord MALCOLM of Poltalloch has introduced the
starling on to his estates in Jamaica in order to repair the ravages
of the mongoose. But what has the latter ravaged? Surely
not the great Argyll chieftain? I would back him against all the
mongeese, aye ! and all the mongoslings, too, in the world. I know
the mongoose well, and so, possibly, do you. He is a being unfittec
to be trusted alone, especially in Jamaica, where rum is grown so
freely. Evidently, however, he has misconducted himself, or Lore
MALCOLM would not have sent for the starling. But why the star-
ling? I never heard before that he was good at repairs. The
tailor-bird I could understand, but not such a Pecksniffian bipec
as the starling. If Lord MALCOLM has been ravaged he coulc
surely have applied to a neighbouring beak or to

SPORTIVE SONGS.
A Playgoer visits Ibsen and meets with an old
aequaiiitance.
LAST night I went to see a. play,
A drama up-to-date.
Wherein a woman holds the sway
With love and rage and hate:
A kind of nightmare on the boards
That I thought very coarse;
French wit played not on laughing
chords—
'Twas taken from the Norse.
I do not like these dreadful homes
Of dirty-linen dreams,
Where Commonplace is writ in tomes
And ranted out in reams!
Where Nature "s painted as a brute
And Mankind as a sot,
Where Common Decency is mute,
Because they know her not!
Give me the fables of my youth,
When Virtue reigned supreme!
The striving after what is truth,
And not a filthy dream!
The village maiden sore distressed
I "d rather gaze on far,
Than look upon, with mind oppressed,
This harmony in tar!
Long, long ago—ah me, how long !—
A little maid I knew,
She sang a little plaintive song,
And sang to very few.
'Twas all about the buds in Spring
And bells that sweetly chime;
E'en now I hear that ditty's ring,
The while my heart beats time!
A tenth-rate playhouse was the scene,
Where sang this little maid
Of how she welcomed back the green
In Spring, but half afraid
Of what the Summer sun might bring,
Or Autumn's ruddy glow,
She yet would sing the Song of Spring
E'en 'mid the Winter snow!
I loved—the moral of that song!
I loved—its trite refrain!
I loved—the symphonies all wrong!
I loved—the simple strain!
I loved—the singer s untrained voice!
I loved—her shake untrue!
I loved—the darling of my choice!
I loved—the girl I knew!
And through the blatant farce last night
That song I seemed to hear,
E'en when the heroine's weird flight
Made ardent pittites cheer.
E'en when she went at last to rest,
Dishonoured and undone,
My heart kept time within my breast,
For she and you are One!
At the Fox-earths.

SUBURBAN SENSE.—Mr. GRANT ALLEN

this fact which annoys the man who didn't?
ADAM AND AN APPLE.
IN the charming performance of As You
Like It, at the St. James's Theatre, the
banished Duke and his followers appear to
live on a diet of raw apples. It is doubt-
less as good as the Grape Cure, the Whey
Cure, or any other cure. But when Adam,
a man of eighty, nearly dead from ex-
haustion, is revived with a large, cold, raw
apple, our admiration for the Apple Cure
is vastly increased. And when this aged
and almost dying man, instead of having
a fit or falling dead, walks and talks gaily,
our admiration for the Apple Cure ia un-
bounded. The only improvement we can
suggest is that Adam should sing the fol-
lowing song in place of the one written for
Amiens:—
Blow, blow, thou winter wind,
Hang me if I shall mind,
I 've tried the Apple Cure;
And after eating these
I care not if it freeze,
All cold I can endure.
Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green apple,
With which my digestion can gleefully grapple.
Then hcigh-ho the apple
Warm as graveyard chapel!
Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,
Thou dost not bite so nigh
As does the Apple Cure
I 'd cat a lump or ice,
It would be quite as nice,
Though not perhaps us pure.
Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green apple,
To keep us all out of the grim graveyard chapel.
With, heigh-ho, the apple
I even can grapple.

LONDON.
DKAB MIBTBR,—Ah, qud en-tite, what in head I come of to
write I London! I have ventured to make you part of my
impressions of some towns of province, but until here I have not
degrees de temps en temps, of time in time, and I commence at
present by some parts of the City, the most great arrondissement
of London, and the veritable centre of the commerce of the
world.
As me the most part of the voyagers gain the City in going
from the "Westend" by the street which calls herself the
Strand. As me they think probably to the great town and to
her history of thousand years. They come to see the magnifi-
cent centre of commerce, the most great and the most rich
town of the world, the proud capital of the britannic Empire,
the Rome of the nineteenth century. When they are thus im-
pressioned of respect and of admiration, what is this then the
first monument which they meet? Is it a statue as that of
BABTOLOMHEO COLLEONI, which one sole Italian town erected
four hundred years before the epoch of the universal suffrage, of
the national education and of the official schools of the beautiful
arts? Is it a statue worthy of the britannic Empire, thousand
times more rich than the ancient Republic of Venise?
At the entry of the City, in face the Palace of Justice, one
searches, one regards, one leans the head in outside of the
"handsome cab." What is this that this is that that? Cal
Allans done, let us go then I Ok, la, la! But, say then, a
monument to make to die of to laugh 1 Planted there, absolutely at
the middle of the street, a monument of the most ridicules, of
the most divertings! In regarding this droll of dragon, who would
can to think of the dignity of London? The most serious of
the greek philosophers, who knew themselves without doubt in
sculpture, of which they were surrounded of so beautiful pieces,
would have burst of to laugh. The most silent of the Red
Skins, men still more solemn, and ignoring absolutely the sculp-
ture, would laugh A gorge lUployee, at throat unfolded. The
English soles are enough serious and enough solemn for to pass
this monument without to show the least little smile.
As to me, each time that I see him I laugh again. The first
time I believed him an announce, a reclame, of some "panto-
mime." But no! It is an announce of the beautiful arts of
London, of the good taste of the municipality. It is the unique
pleasantery of the solemn Londonians. At some steps from this
monument, Mister Punch, finds himself your redaction, your
office of redactor hi chief. May I to say that he is never come
from there any pleasantery so enormously droll as this pleasantery
in bronze? The Londonians are calm and serious, but at the
foundation they must to be one can not more laughers. One
would have beautiful—on aurait beau—to search at Paris, town
so gay, a statue as that I
And of more. A statue of your great and good QUEBN should
to be placed on a pedestal as he must, comme il faut. But on
the hideous base beneath this dragon of pantomime, in a posi-
tion absolutely indignant, and splashed of the filthy mud of
London, find themselves two miserable statues which represent,
one has told me, the QUEEN and the Prince of WALES. See
there the respectuous homage of the City of London!
However, Mister Punch, I wish not only to blame, I venture
also to suggest. This year here the English celebrate the long
and glorious reign of Her Majesty. AH the world desires to
erect some monuments worthy of a sovereign so illustrious and
so venerated. The municipality of London could do better than
that, in destroying rather than in erecting. It would be the
best evidence of their respect towards the QUEEN that of to make
to disappear this frightful monument and the two statues.
As to the dragon, voila a beautiful gift for your friend Li
HUNO CHAM; . Only, as he is aged, and as he laughs never, the
view of a dragon so infinitely more hideous than the most
frightful dragon of China would could to kill bun of horror. He
would value better, perhaps, to sell this eauehemar en bronze to
the Theatre of Drurylane. Agree, Ac., AUQUSTE.
THE WHALE FOR THE BULL.—We understand that in conse-
quence of recent developments, the name of Boscombe is to be
changed to that of Belugachine.

VERY INTERESTING TO LONDONERS.)
(By Our Specud Fldneur.)
New York, January 26.—There was a snowstorm here last
night, which effectually concealed the up and down paving ot
Broadway, but was highly appreciated by some of the younger
members of the Upper Four Hundred, who indulged in a game
of snow-balls just as the visitors were leaving the Metropolitan
Opera House. The weather did not, however, interfere with the
Spoof-Hop given by Mrs. General SPILINS (wife of the Hon.
General SPILINS, the great rag and bone contractor), and the
gathering was quite one of the successes of the season. Each
guest on arriving was presented with a diamond toothpick, which
came in very handy after the supper of truffled oysters, stuffec
terrapin, and canvas-back ducks on toast, the whole being
washed down with '84 champagne in Jereboams only. Among
the principal belles present were Miss CIII.NKIE COCKLESNAPPEV
(a member of one of the old Knickerbocker families), a delicate
blonde with gold hair and teeth; Miss WOOTSIB WAMPUN, the
very brunette daughter of Commodore WAMPUN, President of
the Brighton Beach Yacht Club; Miss HIBRKNIA MAOGHUDDERY,
second daughter of ex-Judge MACORUDDERY, Proprietor of the
Erin-go-bragh blend of whiskey; and Mrs. PINKUS-PORKUS, the
widow of the eminent Cincinnati provision merchant. She was
formerly the wife of Senator JUMBLES, and, when divorced, mar-
ried Governor HOUPLA of St. Louis (Mo.), whom she divorced
in order to espouse Mr. PINKUS-PORKUS. Mrs. SPILINS, who
wore a green gauze gown trimmed with beaver fur, Valenciennes
lace and rubies, danced the cachuca on the table after supper,
and Mr. LBONIDAS B. SPROUT (one of the ancient Pilgrim Brus-
sels-Sprouts) led the cotillon, into which a live sucking-pig and
a Virginian 'coon were introduced with most humorous effect.
General SPILINS had on a pair of boots which once belonged to
Marshal BLUCHER, and was much congratulated on their acqui-
sition.
A marriage wa» celebrated this morning at the 990th Avenue
Hotel between Mr. JOSHUA \KIIXES GRABS, of Wall Street
(reputed to be worth eight millions of dollars), and Mrs. JANE
JEMIMA VANTOFF, perhaps better known at the Court of St.
James's as Mrs. L. J. CORKINQTON, she having been separated
definitely from Mr. CORKINOTON last September. The ceremony
was attended by the elite of New York aristocracy, and tin
bride, who wore a gown of artificial orange-blossoms on satin,
and a sixteen-star diamond coronet, was given away by Mr.
NATHANIEL ZEUS CORKINOTON, nephew of her late husband.
The wedding breakfast was served on the roof of the Hotel in a
glade of palm trees specially imported from Africa, and known
as the Riviera Retreat. I have never seen such a coruscation
of combined loveliness and jewels as was here exhibited. The
happy couple left in the evening for Mr. GRABB'S palace in
Florida by special Pullman train. They are to be the guests
next season of the Duke and Duchess of DHUNNIEWASSAL, at
Skelpie Castle, in Scotland.
Things theatrical were rather dull till Mile. TOUPICHON, known
as the TLiving Top. was arrested to-night by the police after her
exhibition at Clam s Temple of Fame. Her performance consists
in spinning on her nose. Judge VAN PUMPELBECK held the
lively artist to bail, on her own security, in five thousand dollars.
The event has created great excitement in fashionable circles.
CONFIDENCE FOR CONFIDENCE.
IN a lecture upon the Art of Interviewing, delivered before
the Society of Women Journalists, an expert suggested that an
important advantage was gained by the interviewer if he made
a favourable first impression upon the interviewed. This seems
highly probable. So Mr. Punch sees no reason why he should
not give a helping hand to those adopting interviewing as a pro-
fession. To the young personal inquirer he says by all means
make a favourable first impression upon your subject. There is
a right way and a wrong way to do it. He will give some
examples.
Supposing that the youthful interviewer has to see an arch-
bishop. He gains the presence chamber and finds the dignified
ecclesiastic waiting to receive him. Supposing that he seizes
the cleric by the nand, and, calling him "Reverend Sir." asks
his opinion upon the chances of the winter favourite for the
DerDV—why, this would be the wrong way of doing it, and
very likely create a most unfavourable first impression.
But supposing that instead of acting as described the young
beginner respectfully bows before an archdeacon, calls him "arch-
bishop," and respectfully invites "His Grace's" opinion upon
the condition of the Diocese. Although he would nave made a

THEIR WIVES, THAN TO THEIR OWN ENERGY AND TALENTS."

LADY BINKR, NONE COULD SAY THAT OF SIR PETER!"
mistake in the titles of his subject (for which the archdeacon
would gently chide him), still, he would have created a very
favourable impression.
Lastly, here is another way. Supposing a young man has to
interview a literary lion, who can dispose of his work at so many
shillings the line in any quantity. Remembering thia, the
visitor, instead of wasting the time of his subject with idle ques-
:ioning, might thus address him:—"My good Sir, all you may
tell me will make excellent copy, and on that account, as only n
HMI stands between your words and the printer, I think it is
jnly just that you should derive profit from your own brainwork."
Probably this last method would be considered—by authors, at
any rate—the best of the three. And, perchance, it might come
about that the interviewed would address the young interviewer
as follows:—"My good friend, as you have still your way to
make I will do you a kind turn. You have been frank and con-
siderate, and I will reward you. Here, I don't want to deprive you
of a task that may lead to further advancement in your career as a
>romising journalist, but as I would rather that there should be
10 mistakes, I wiU write the interview myself! If it is too
avourable, or the reverse, your editor's blue pencil will know
low to deal with it." And then, with a hearty shake of the
hand, Interviewing Cox and Interviewed Box would both be
satisfied.

To a fellow who means business, and in-

The extra bit of candle to enable you to

Though the hoard school is a boon, Ton,

There would be excuse for nodding o'er

DRY HUMOUR.
"BE'N'T YE COMIX' OVER TOR 'IM, HISTEK!
A CALL FROM ARMS.
GOOD MASTER PUNCH,—We address you,
as you have an heraldic disposition. You
have not two supporters to your arms (un-
less you count your staff), but you have
one—a faithful one—in dog Toby. And on
his account you will feel for us—at least,
that is our hope and impression.
For a very long time we have been
accorded comfortable quarters—or, we
should say, quarterings—in the Royal
Arms. We do not allude to a hostelry of
that title, but in the Imperial Emblazon-
ment. We do no harm, although there is
some slight provocation to cause a disturb-
ance in the facts that the Irish harp is in
the next lodging, and the Scottish lion is
rampant on the floor—or should we say
field? — above us. And our calm air of
peacefulness is all the more praiseworthy
as three others of our race, who are not
one whit better than ourselves, are placed
in front of us, leading the whole heraldic
procession. Now for our grievance. Sud-
denly some gentleman, dating from the
Htuso of Commons, writes to the daily
papers, and asks for our dismissal! We
are to be turned out to make room for
some double-headed monster representing
India and the Colonies! The misguided
individual who thus seeks to disturb our
comfort proposes that the monster shall
be a lion 1 Adding insult to injury! Why
another HonP Surely there are' enough
already. Besides, we know what a full-
sized lion is like. Look at the Scottish
lion. Of course, we must not speak ill of
our neighbours, but cannot you see that he
is playing an imaginary pair of bagpipes?
If you don't hear the national instrument,
it is because usually our flag is floating too
high over your head to hear anything.
And why should India and Australia bfi
represented by a lion? India has made the
tiger her own, and Australia the kangaroo.
Besides, we do not care for lions in too
great quantities. Strictly, between our-
selves, we are not lions, but only
leopards! No; if the Royal Arms must
be disturbed, send the two-headed mon-
ster or the tiger and the kangaroo outside.
Let them help the lion and the unicorn to
support our dignity. If we know those
two quarrelsome neighbours at all, we
fancy they will make short work of them!
They have not forgotten the days, wfe
ween, when they "fought for the crown"
—as all good subjects of Her Most Gra-
cious Majesty, indeed, should and truly
would.
One last reason for our retention. If
we three lions in the last quarter were
turned out, the other three lions in the
first would mope for us. And all six of UK
look sufficiently melancholy as it is I So
say a good word for us, and earn the grati-
tude of Yours sincerely,

Question. With what end in view do you accept an occupation
that appears—on the first blush—to be neither amiable nor
useful?
Answer. To gratify a strong desire for mischief at the cost of
someone else's comfort, convenience and profit.
Q. Then you do not attempt to laugh a play off the boards
merely to protect the interests of the drama?
A. Certainly not, for those interests are in far safer hands
when they are guarded by managers who have their cash, and
dramatic critics their reputation at stake in performing their
duty to the British public.
Q. What is the duty of a manager to the British public?
A. To select, cast, and rehearse a play in such a manner that
those who attend the performance shall have no reason to regret
the money spent for admission to the auditorium.
Q. And what should be the object of the dramatic critic P
A. To write an article that the readers of the paper to which
he is accredited shall find a faithful adviser in the choice of
theatres with suitable entertainments.
Q. Is the work of these two servants of the public a pleasure?
A. That is a matter of chance, but it is certainly an affair of
business.
Q. Then your action as a play-wrecker differs in one impor-
tant particular from the duty of a manager and a professional
critic?
A. Of course ; as my object is merely to amuse myself, without
counting the cost to the community.
Q. Does it require a profound knowledge of the stage to
follow your calling P
A. Not at all; as my object is obtained by catching up some
unimportant line in the dialogue and turning it to account by
casting it into ridicule.
Q. Will you give an illustration of your meaning?
A. Suppose that someone on the stage has to say, at the
commencement of the last act, "I wish that this were over,"
then it would be my cue to answer, "And BO do we."
Q. It does not matter, I suppose, whether the speech on the
stage was appropriate to the dramatic situation?
A. Quite so. Whether the play is good or bad the retort will
be equally effective.
Q. I see; then the omission of the stage-manager to cut out a
risky line in an excellent play gives you an opportunity to en-
danger the fortunes of a work that may have cost years of
thought and thousands of hard-earned money P
A. Very likely; but that is the fault of the authorities be-
hind the curtain.
Q. And you know that the first thoughtless laugh may be
followed by many others?
A. So I have observed; and, consequently, when I have made
the first step in wrecking a play the remainder of the task is
delightfully easy.
Q. I suppose you have not considered that the wreck of a play
entails not only loss upon author and manager, but usually
scores of breadwinners?
A. I have not given that matter much thought; but no doubt
if actors, actresses, and the I'lnjilinii'-x behind the scenes see the
shutters up, they must look elsewhere for situations.
Q. And what benefit do you derive from having assisted to
cause a fiasco?
A. The positive pleasure of enjoying a cruel laugh and the
possible advantage of being considered a minor wit amongst small
circle of acquaintances.
Q. Then, taking everything into consideration, and giving your
reply as a representative of a fairly good-natured community of
Englishmen, is the game quite worth the candle? [iVo answer.

ever printed), the sun will have broken
out, the frost have disappeared, and nature
will be smiling in cheerful spring-brought
sunshine. But for the moment—the ice
will bear.
My doctor tells me that exercise is
everything for me. Well, as I weigh well,
or rather badly, over fifteen stone, I re-
quire things on a large scale. My horses
should be elephants, and if I took to cy-
cling, the machine would have to be par-
ticularly strong in the framework. But
this is not a question of horses or bikes.
All I want is a pair of skates—I am told
Caledonians, for choice—and there I am.
But there is a certain drawback to my pro-
gress. I have never tried skating. Fact
is, that whenever there was any ice avail-
able in my neighbourhood, the moment I
made up my mind to put on skates, there
commenced a thaw. So I have never had
any practice—to speak of. Indeed, had I
had any, there would have been a good
deal to speak of painfully. But away with
idle regrets, the ice will bear.
I am at the edge of the frozen water.
My skates have been put on firmly, and I
move forward. Come, this is excellent.
I find I can stand on the blades. But not
for more than five moments. A gust of
wind catches me, and I move feebly for-
ward. Then my right leg suddenly goes
one way, and the left another. Then both
heels ascend sharply, and down I come on
my back. First fall for—or rather on—
the ice. I get up, and having lost my hat,
try to secure it with the assistance of my
umbrella. I cannot rise; as when I put one
foot firmly on the ice, the knee of
the other leg topples over, and I find my-
self on all fours. However, at length I
secure the hat and replace it on my head.
My satisfaction is great, especially when I
remember that the ice will bear.
I am assisted to rise by two kindly
skaters who take pity on my forlorn con-
dition. I find that I can walk a bit by
standing on the sides of the skates. I am
told that this is the wrong way, and once
more put firmly—well, scarcely firmly—on
my feet. I am on the centre of the pond.
Or rather, I am a little nearer one bank
than the other. There is safety in that
nearer bank. The other is a shaky invest-
ment. I smile at the amusing thought—
and stumble. This is no time for frivolity.
I strike out nervously. My left leg be-
haves better than I could possibly have
expected. The right comes up to the left.
Both secure—as yet. Then the boisterous
wind again makes sport of me. I am being
bcrne along towards a placard bearing an
inscription. I cannot control my actions.
I have but one comfort left—the ice will
bear. . . . 2W>, it won't!

Hfiuse of Commons, Monday, January 25.
—-At first sight there is nothing about
HENRY HOWORTH that reminds one of Fal-
stnff. Nor has WHITE RIDLEY quite the
figure of Prince Hal. Yet to-night he fell
quite naturally into the attitude of the
light-hearted Prince on a famous occasion.
"Mark," said Prince Hal, when Falstaff
had made an end of the detailed narrative
of his fight with the men in buckram,
"Mark now how plain a tale shall put you down."
On Friday PRINCE ARTHUR, knowing all
the facts, burning with indignation at
aspersions and insinuations which painted
WHITE RIDLBT a black conspirator, flew
at the astonished HOWORTH, banged him
about the head, almost literally hustled
him off premises. PRINCE ARTHUR so
violently angry, people began to think
there was something in the charge.
To-night HOME SECRETARY appears at
table, unruffled, serene in the snowy white-
ness of his innocence. Did not even turn
aside for a moment to rap at HOWORTH or
lament over JEMMY LOWTHEB'S latest lapse
from line with old friends and colleagues
on Treasury Bench. It had been said that
RIDLEY'S release of the dvnamitards was
an encouragement to crime, that it had
been accomplished in political collusion
with the Irish Members. HOME SECRE-
TARY simply said these things were not,
and in few unadorned sentences substan-
tiated his denial. Carried entire House
with him, and though JEMMY LOWTHBR
tipped his hat further back over his broad
brow, and smiled inscrutably, HOWORTH
hastened to abandon his amendment.
A striking triumph this of force of moral
character. There are, as SAHK says, two
personages for whom House of Commons
has unerring scent. One is a humbug, the
other an honest man.
"Business done.—Debate on Address.
Tuesday.—TIM HEALY wandering about
the corridors and lobby in strangely pen-
sive mood. Committee Room No. 15,
birthplace of a United Irish Party, has
been once more the scene of interchange
of fraternal feeling. Resolution carried
which practically expels from the brother-
hood TIM and those faithful to him. It is
not this thunderclap that clouds his manly
brow, that dims his eyes with unwonted
moisture, and causes to quiver lips that
sternly close when the figure of JOHN
DILLON crosses his path. They might pass
what resolutions they pleased, and TIM'B
stout heart would beat, without tremor or

regret. There is worse than that, and
TIM'S voice falters as he tells the tale.
"After they passed the resolution," says
he, "I got up and openly declared that I
defied and despised its provisions. On re-
suming my seat, I wrote a polite request
that this phrase should be entered on the
formal minutes of the proceedings, and
what do you think? They refused to do it."
Thus was the iron driven into TIM'S soul.
In a free country, at the close of the so-
called nineteenth century, gathered within
the precincts of the mother of Parlia-
ments, the chairman, representing a ma-
jority of a meeting, actually declines at
the request of one present to enter on the
minutes the fact that the gentleman in the
body of the room "defied and despised"
conclusions arrived at by the said majo-
rity I That is the last straw breaking the
stalwart back upon which has been piled
contumely after contumely. It was not
much to ask; a few scratches of the pen
would have done it. JOHN DILLON, in-
ebriate in the strength of his majority,
stubbornly refused. So the die was cast,
and TIM, perhaps not without generous
tears, has finally severed the tie that bound
him to his old associates. Now there are
not two Irish Parties, but three Irish
Parties, all hating each other for the love
of Ireland.
"There's the Dillonites and the Red-
mondites ; what will your Party be called?''
I asked TIM.
"They 'd better call us the Ishmaelites,"
he said: "I warrant we '11 live up to the
part."
Business done.—Address agreed to.
Wednesday.—The House laughed noisily
when RITCHIE jumped up just now, inter-
cepted the lead pencil JEMMY LOWTHBR was
handing back to HOWARD VINCENT, and
put it in his pocket. But there was a
h< How ring in the laughter. There
remains an uneasy feeling in reviewing the
incident.
Ib arose in debate on Dill to amend
Merchandise Marks Act. Early in its

course, RITCHIE lent HOWARD VINCENT a
lead pencil. (As marking the happily tem-
porary, certainly deplorable, lapse of
morality current, it may be mentioned
that HOWARD VINCENT forgot to return
the article.) In proof of the invasion of
goods made in Germany, lead pencils were
flashing forth in all directions. Ever was
found on them the mark of the Beast—
"Made in Bavaria."
JEMMY LOWTHER, conscious of rectitude,
fearless in his Protectionist principles,
drew a pencil from his poke, and (in Par-
liamentary language, of course) offered to
bet the SPEAKER two to one that it was
English made. Fortunately for him, the
bet not taken. JEMMY, examining his pro-
perty, found that it also was made in Ba-
varia. In gallant attempt to cover his
confusion, HOWARD VINCENT passed to him
across Gangway another pencil bearing the
same mark. JEMMY, having ascertained
this fact, was handing the thing back,
when up jumped President of the Board
of Trade, made a dash at the pencil as
aforesaid, and pocketed it.
"Then," said Mr. LOWTHER, in stern
voice, "this is a pencil supplied to a
Minister of the Crown?"
"No," said RITCHIE, trembling under
his frown. "I got it in the library."
"Well;" said the judicial JEMMY, in-
voluntarily passing his hand over his head
as if feeling for the Black Cap, "it is a
pencil acquired by a Minister of the Crown,
and I think a Minister of the Crown ought
to acquire an English-made article."
How lovely is that word "acquire"!
"'Convey' the wise call it." "Acquire"
is the way of putting it that occurs to the
judicial mind of JEMMY LOWTHER wjhen
for a moment a shade hangs low over the
moral character of a Minister of the
Crown.
Business done. — HOWARD VINCENT'S
Merchandise Marks Amendment Bill po-
litely, but firmly, thrust forth.
Thursday.—Throughout occasional tu-
mult of debate to-night on Lord PEN-
RHYN'B quarrel with his quarrymen, there
sat on front bench of Peers' Gallery a tall
figure with face inscrutably masked,
stonily staring. At beginning of sit-
ting, there was crowd of Peers. None
spoke to the Masked Figure, nor It to
them. It took Its seat at question time,
and with brief interval, when SPEAKER re-
tired, It remained till eleven o'clock, when
debate closed.
Nothing that passed in animated scent
below brought a flicker of expression to
the stony face. JONES of Arfon set forth
case of quarrymen in speech of admirable
tone, delivered with modest mien that
quickly won sympathy of House. Lord
PENRHYN'S son and heir stumbled over
monuments of manuscript in defence oi
hia noble father. BROMLEY-DAVENPORT de-
livered brilliantly erratic speech on same
lines. President of Board of Trade, jeered
at from below Gangway, where the young
Tory lions were conscious of approach of
feeding time, defended action of his de-
partment. SQUIRE op MALWOOD solemnly
improved the occasion. PRINCE ARTHUR,
troubled about many things, clawed vici-
ously at the stately figure that had just re-
sumed its seat on Front Opposition Bench.
So the discussion rolled on, sometimes
monotonously meandering, oftener tumb-
ling down turbulently like the waters at
Lodore. Always the figure in the Peers'
Gallery sat impassive, stonily staring.
Quite fascinated me. Asked SARK who

To-night gave fresh assurance in new di-
rection. House engaged in carrying South
African Committee; got into a muddle as
to whether number should be seventeen or
fifteen; dilemma intensified by discovery
that the motion as it stood on the paper
proposed sixteen. SAUNDKRSON, who fears
nothing, grappled with difficulty for seve-
ral moments. At last gave it up in despair.
When House believed that, somehow or
other, it had been settled, TIM HEALY
brought it up in fresh phase.
All eyes turned towards SPEAKER.
Right hon. gentleman slowly rose. Before
he could open his mouth, the CAP'EN had
tripped his anchor, slewed his forearm—
(" Four arm?" growls JOHNSTON of Bally-
kilbeg, "why, he's only got one")—run
his lee-scuppers before the wind, and set-
tled the whole matter.
"That is what I was about to say,"
meekly observed the SPEAKER, when the
CAP'EN had signalled his message.
A generous but unfortunate admission.
It may lead to the question being some
day raised, Why not save the salary of the
SPEAKER, entrusting his duties to the care
of the CAP'EN?

AUGUSTE EN ANGLETERRE.
LONDON.
DF.AU MISTER,—In continuing my researches in the City, after
to have passed the dragon of pantomime at the entry, I desire to
visit the Bank of England. I hare already seen the exterior
several times. He is not beautiful; he has the air of a prison.
Evidently for to admire the Bank of England he must to visit
the interior.
In face the Bank one sees the palace of the Lord Maire. It is
a palace enough sad, noir et morne, and absolutely without gar-
den. One time I have asked myself how the Lord Maire and
Madame la Lord Mairesse—how says one her title P—can to walk
themselves. It is impossible in the streets so encumbered of
persons. What world! What noise I What movement I I
thought that, perhaps, the Lord Maire exercises himself to make
the box" in one of the saloons. But, commf. pa, as that, he
would respire but the air of a room. For an English he must
absolutely to exercise himself in full air. In passing the palace
for to arrive at the Bank of England, I ask myself again that
whioh he does.
I descend from the "handsome cab," I enter the court of the
Bank, and suddenly I find the response to this enigma. See
there that mister so respectable, so full of dignity, dressed in
magnificent robes of scarlet and of gold, and carrying on the
head a chapeau a comes, a hat to horns 1 It is him! I say to
myself, "1 iens, AUGUSTS- mon eher, tu as de la chance, voila le
Lord Maire qui se promene en grandf tenue!" In fine I com-
prehend, by blue I The Lord Maire has not of garden. There-
fore be is obliged of to walk himself in the court of the Bank.
C'est dommage, it is damage that Mcilmni' la Lord Mairesse ac-
companies him not to-day. Eh well, I have seen the Lord
Maire 1 He has the figure very amiable, the beard grey and a
little long, and he has at the least six feet of height. I per-
ceive that he salutes gravely several misters who enter. It is
istonishing that they return his salute so coldly. Even they
lift not the hat. See there the pride of the great financiers, of
the high bank, in the City I They are equals of the Lord Maire.
They are proud as the Senators of Venise, aa the Grands of
Spain.
I ought to say that I rest during these some instants a little
hidden under the arch of entry. Truly I am suchly astonished
and interested that I think not, for the moment, that it is im-
polite that of to regard thus the most great man of London. I
hope that he has not perceived me. I think to retire my-
self discreetly, when I meet the benevolent regard of the Lord
Maire. I lift respectuously my hat high form. Him also he
lifts the hat, and then he asks very graciously that which 1
desire. Ah, the good occasion! I respond to him, "Milord, if
that can himself I would wish well to visit the interior of the
Bank." He says that for that a stranger must be presented to
the directors by some person of their acquaintance, but that I
can to visit the court, the three offices around, and the garden.
The garden! Ah, voila enfin le jardin du Lord Maire! I
thank him infinitely of his gracious amiability, I visit the droll
of garden, absolutely black, with two melancholy trees, and some
shrubs all fletris, and then I go to search a mister of my ac-
quaintance, without doubt very well known of the directors, who
will have perhaps the goodness of to present me.
He is very amiable, and of a charming politeness. Himself he
accompanies me to the Bank, where he shows me the grand
saloon and the library. This last is small, and resembles a little
to a cellar. _ Then we visit the printery—imprimerie—the cellars
of the bullion, the "weighing machines," and the room where
the gold and the notes of bank are amassed. Ah heaven, what
richnesses 1 Enormously of gold! Partout we are received by
borne very polite misters, who show to me all these things with a
courtesy of which I am extremely recognising. In this last room
they show to me a packet of notes of bank, representing one
million of pounds sterling. I hold him for an instant. It is
a quite littfe packet, which one could send by the "Parcel Post"
for four pennies and half. They take him from a quit* little cup-
board, filled of notes of thousand pounds; a little cupboard of
which the contents represents more than all the richnesses of
Johannesburg! My faith, it is astonishing I I am almost boule-
verse by the idea of richnesses so enormous 1
Then we quit the Bank. In traversing the court we encounter
the Lord Maire, who salutes my friend, but this last makes but
a little sign of head, a nod. "How," I say to him, "you other
Londonians are so proud that you return not even the salute of
your Lord Maire ?" The Lord Maire," responds my friend,
where is he? I don't see him." "There," I say, "in robes of
gala, he has saluted you." My friend edate de rire, and laughs
so much that he can not to respond to me. In fine he becomes
more calm, and then he says, "That's not the Lord Maire, that 'g
the porter of the Bank."
Oh la la! Je me suis trompe. Mais quelle Jfatigue, avec un
concierge comme ea! Agree, Ac., AUGUSTS.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THE Theatrical and Musical Recollections of Miss EMILY SOL-
ID-INK (Mrs. POWELL) will interest and amuse all who care
anything either about music-hall matters or the introduction
of Offenbachian opera-bouffe to the London stage. Opera
bouffe came in just as that form of burlesque in one act
and five scenes, which had succeeded to the extravaganza in
scenes and acts, was moribund. With this novelty up went
the price of production, and soon afterwards up went the price
of seats in the auditorium. Genuine opera-bouffe at its best
ceased to exist with OFFENBACH. 11 KHVF, and others were only
of the Offenbachian school.
The charm of Miss SOUIKSK'S narrative is her simplicity of style.
Like the heathen Chinee, she is " childlike and bland." She is
so thoroughly Bohemian, telling so much, and yet leaving just so
much more to be understood as can be conveyed in a wink and
a nod, expressed by a sudden hiatus in the narrative. The Baron,
who never had the pleasure of the lady's personal acquaintance,
but who remembers her as Drogan in Gcnevikve de Brabant at the
Philharmonic, wonders how certain exalted and generally supe-
rior personages, nowadays (" at their time o' life," as HERBERT
CAMPBELL sings), like seeing the records of their bygone behind-
the-scenes days? The pretty little anecdote at p. 137 is one of
the instances of the Writer's "I-could-an'-if-I would " style. Un-
less Miss SOLDENE were present on the occasion, on what au-
thority is she enabled so graphically to describe the attitude and
action of a certain exalted personage during his visit to the
dressing-room of Mr. DION BOUCICAULT? However, taken as a
whole, the reminiscences are good light reading, as the dry
business details can be skipped, and if Miss SOLDENB has " more
where these came from," there can be no doubt that her pub-
lishers will be "Downey" enough to secure her next book for
the general benefit.
"Methinks," quoth one of the Baron's Baronites, "this is the

Park, "Beware of Explosive Mines!" Retire hastily into Cur-
zon Street and work eastward along back streets. Reach
passage under Devonshire House garden. It is inscribed,
Closed for Storage of Nitre-Glycerine." Get round by Berke-
ley Square into Bond Street. Hope no projectiles will be flying
through the air. Put up umbrella. Good idea, walk down
Burlington Arcade. Paving there covered with boards. Notice
up at entrance, "Tread lightly to avoid exploding Dynamite
beneath." Leave hurriedly, and endeavour to get into Regent
Street. Find narrow pass of Vigo Street blocked with earth-
work and cannon. Retreat to Bond Street and get into Picca-
dilly. Another battery of artillery commanding the slope of St.
James's Street. Observe that all the omnibuses have been ar-
ranged to carry one Maxim gun outside. Avoid cannon, go
down Bury Street, and at last reach Athenaeum.
Hurry inside, and fall over heap of sandbags. Get up, some-
what shaken, and then discover five bishops and a judge assisting
in the removal of these bags to the roof. One of them hastily
tells me that the club is being made quite safe, the roof being
arranged for guns and the wine-cellar filled with barrels of
powder. Blesa me, how horrible!

sure, representing Millions of fellow-sym-

case. 1 suppose that we all retire to our
uch to go to sleep, therefore, let me sum-
marise how the Anns interfere with this
laudable intention, as illustrated by the
following table (taking "You" to be
"We").
1. You lie on your back, hands crossed
after the fashion of a Crusader on a tomb-
stone. Iti'suit. — Pins and needles and
change of position.
2. You shift over to the right side; right
arm mutely quiescent, left arm indignantly
dependent. Result.—Back position again.
3. You shift over to the left side: left arm
mutely quiescent, right arm indignantly
dependent. Result.—Back position again.
•t. In opposition to this armed inter-
ference with your rest you place both hands
beneath your head. Result. — Rush of
blood to the head, and energetic protest of
legs and feet.
5. You turn your face to the pillow.
Itesult.—Suffocation and snoring. Arms
still obdurate.
6. You cross your arms as if engaged in
a hornpipe, and roll about like a water-
logged ship, lira nit.—Concussion of el-
bows with ironwork of bedstead, and a de-
sire to clasp your knees or pummel the wall.
7. Again trying the back position you
lay your arms straight down by your sides.
Itt'.iult.—Dyspeptic sleep and waking night-
mares.
8. Total Result.—Nox, et prceterea nihil.
In this precis I fancy that Lord SALIS-
BURY himself would not disavow my capa-
bility, but <i quoi bonf My slumbers would

ference of those members which are as ob-
trusive and as useless as are several Na-

ACADEMIC DISCUSSION.
(Extracted from a Newspaper of a future date,
when our own Undergraduates have followed
the example recently set them at the Universi-
ties of Athens and Moscow.)
[FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.]
Cambridge, Ifcmday.
I REGRET to say that an incident oc-
curred in one of the Trinity lecture-rooms
this morning, which is likely to cause a
fresh disturbance here. Professor SAW-
DUST, in his translation of a passage of
TITITCYIHDEH, pointed out that the standard
of courage amongst young men had been
greatly lowered since the days of ancient
Greece. The class unanimously regarded
these strictures as a deliberate insult to
themselves, and they at once knocked the
Professor down, and left the room. Subse-
quently a general meeting of the under-
graduates was held, and an ultimatum was
despatched to the master of the college,
demanding a full apology and ten barrels
of audit ale by way of compensation. The
reply of the master has not been received
up to the present, but if it be unfavour-
able, an outbreak ef hostilities will cer-
tainly follow. Machine-guns already are
being placed in those windows of the col-
lege which overlook the street.
Later.
No answer having been received, war has
been declared. Most of the Dons suc-
ceeded in making their escape over the
river, but the Senior Dean, the Head-
Porter, and a couple of bedmakers (who
are suspected of being spies) are now impri-
soned in the Buttery. The college is in a
state of seige, and the Senate has been sit-
ting for several hours to consider the situa-
tion. Reinforcements from Clare and Mag-
dalene are said to be coming to the assist-
ance of Trinity; but St. John's sides
strongly with the professor, and their men
have announced their intention of taking
Trinity by storm to-morrow.
Tuesday.
Trinity is still untaken. One or two
sorties occurred in the night, and seventy
or eighty townsmen were shot, but no
;hting of any real importance took place.
iJere is great excitement at Newnham,
where, despite the prohibition of the au-
thorities, a mass meeting of students was
held, which passed a resolution of sym-
pathy with the Trinity rebels. Many ladies
from the college have announced their in-
tention of nursing the wounded.
Later.
Fighting became general this afternoon,
and scenes of terrible carnage took place.
A body of Indian students, in native un-
dress, attempted to join in the fray, but
were quickly dispersed with the help of a
fire-engine. Mr. OSCAR BROWNING super-
intended a skilful attack made by a body of
King's men upon Dr. JACKSON'S light in-
fantry. His manoauvres, I am informed,
were based upon a scheme communicated
by the GERMAN EMPEROR. It is ru-
moured that a strong force from Oxford
has started by train in order to take part
in the rising.
Wednesday.
Hostilities have suddenly come to an
end. Thanks to the vigilance of the be-
siegers, the supplies of the Trinity garrison
were entirely cut off. When it was dis-
covered this morning that the whole stock
of marmalade was exhausted, negotiations
for a truce were at once begun. Six of
their leaders met six Fellows of the college
in conference in the market-place, and,
after some difficulty, a peace honourable to
both sides was signed. Professor SAWDCBI
is to lecture no more for three years, and
the undergraduates approval is to be ob-
tained for the appointment of his succes-
sor. A first-class in the Tripos is to be
awarded to all the men of Trinity and
their allies who showed conspicuous valour
during the recent engagement. On the
other hand, any undergraduate shooting a
Don without sufficient cause is to be liable
to be fined by the Proctors, and the pri-
soners are to be released with a caution.
The conclusion of peace has caused gene-
ral rejoicing, and great festivities will ta»
place to-night. ^An ox will be roasted
whole in the great court of Trinity, and
the fountain will flow with Chateau Lafitte.

THE snow has gone, the frost has fled,
And you regret the wintry scene.

And innst an Arctic Summer reign

Trickle away in myriad tears,
You wept, the while you did not know
The meaning of your foolish fears.
You say you thought—indeed were sure—
You loved the earth so fair and white,
And mourned the passing of the pure

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAKIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIAKY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, February 1.
—Universal regret to-night at news flashed
from the Border country that GEORGE
TREVELYAN will sit among us no more.
"At the age of sixty-five, and after forty-
two years of laborious public life, I think
myself entitled to retire on the present
opportunity. The retirement is dictated to
me by my personal views as to the best
method of spending the closing years of
my life. I should, perhaps, add that I am
at present, and mean for a short time to
be, engaged on a special matter which
occupies me closely."
No, no. Of course that's what Mr. G.
wrote to "My dear GRANVILLE" more
than twenty-two years ago, on eve of
epoch in career that would of itself have
made fame of any man. GEORGE TRE-
VELTAN not sixty yet; been only thirty
years in public life. Circumstances other-
wise so similar, even to " special matter"
on hand in TREVELYAN'S study, that I for
moment mixed up things.
Since TREVELYAN, having, for conscience"
sake, separated himself, on Home Bule
question, from his old leader and the Party
inwhichhe was born, and performed the more
heroic act of returning to the fold, he has
been object of especial obloquy in certain
quarters of House. Could understand a
man moved by conscience making one sacri-
fice. But being thereby fortuitously landed
amid circumstances of great prosperity, in
a land flowing with milk and honey, where
judgeships grew like brambles, Privy
Councillorships paved the pathways, and
first pick was had of places in the Ministry
—how, in such circumstances, a politician
should be troubled by further twinges of
conscience, passed the understanding of
simple-minded men. So, when TREVELYAN
rose to speak, they howled at him, openly
jeered, or ostentatiously conversed.
That is over now with his Parliamentary
career. The bitterest partisan recognises
in him an honest man, supersensitively
honest if you will; of chivalrous spirit; of a
courage that did not fear the assassin's knife
in Dublin, nor the Irish Member's tongue
at Westminster; a man who invested poli-
tical controversy with the fine flavour of
literature and the grace of gentlemanhood.
GEORGE TREVELYAN is a born literary
man. From a sense of duty he became a
trained politician, and for thirty years has
served the public in Parliament and on the
platform. His real delight was in books;
his home the library. In the triumphs
and disappointments of an active political
career
His heart untrnrelled fondly turned to home.
Now he has entered it and closed the doors,
presently to emerge, all the world hopes,
with a newly written book of his own.
First night of new piece at Westminste.
Theatre Royal. The Education Bill: a
serious drama, in three acts. These not
named. SQUIRE OF MALWOOD suggests—
Act I., Introduction ; Act II., Amendment;
Act III., Withdrawal. That a matter on
the knees of the gods. (I don't mean in
the gallery.)
Meanwhile, no doubt about success of

THE OLD WHIP!
Sir W-ll-m H-rt D-lct (to Kr. M-cl-n and otheri). "' Minds of your own,' indeed, never heard of
such a thing! Egad, Sir, 1 'd make some of yer come to heel if I had my way!"
the little farce which, in accordance with
old tradition, preceded the drama. A one-
man part, played by JOHN o' GORST. He
is still Minister of Education, you know,
and should, in ordinary circumstances,
have had charge of the Government Bill.
PRINCE ARTHUR thinks he will do it
better, or at least safer. So Vice-Presi-
dent of the Council roots out of pigeon-
holes of office a minute measure stagger-
ing under the title "A Bill to annul an
Order in Council confirming a scheme re-
lating to the Foundation known as the
Bernew School." Just before PRINCE
ARTHUR rose to explain the Education
Bill, JOHN o' GORST, after gruesomely
posing for a moment at the Bar awaiting
the SPEAKER'S signal to advance, solemnly
marches up floor, carefully " bringing in
this infant scheme.
"What's the name of the school?"
PRINCE ARTHUR asked him when he re-
sumed seat on the Treasury Bench,
"Berriew," said JOHN o' GOHBT, in
funereal, almost sepulchral voice.
"' Bury you," " mused PRINCE ABTHUB,
vainly repressing a shudder. "I hope
that's not the proper pronunciation of the
word. It would be a little ominous."
Businets done.—Education Bill introduced
in Committee of Ways and Means.
Tuekday.—Listening to BILLY DYKE just
now discoursing on men and things, the
Education Bill, the revolt below the gang-
way, the iniquity of insubordination and
the right divine of gentlemen on the
Treasury Bench, one sighs to think of the
long silence imposed on this eloquent, per-
suasive tongue, when tied and bound by
the leashes of the Whip. There is general
feeling in House that DYKE has been
badly done to. He bore the heat and
burden of many days merged in all-night
sittings. In office or in Opposition he was
always at his post, adding to the essential
qualities of a man of business the charm,
inestimable in a Whip, of personal popu-
larity. When, in 1895, his Party came
into power with a thundering majority and
the certainty of long possession of office,
the old Whip—old in experience, young in
years as statesmen go—was, so to speak,
hung up in the harness-room. Situation
made all the more bitter by seeing pro-

moted to pleasing office obscure men, who
not only had not served the Party, but,
•when DYKE was drudging in the Whips'
Boom, did their level best to upset the
coach.
Some noble souls thus smitten stride
below the gangway, and there nurse their
wrath to keep it warm. Of finer, truer
metal, BELLY DYKE has shown no sign of
the resentment others feel for him. Here
he is to-night coming to help of Govern-
ment in nasty circumstances, warning re-
calcitrants below gangway of the danger of
the course they have embarked upon, and,
whilst hinting at possibilities of improve-
ment in Education Bill, declaring that he
for one will stand by Ministers to the end.
"I am a Party man," he said proudly.
"1 have always been a Party man. I
hope to live and die a Party man."
That's the stuff strong Parties are made
of. The pity of it, SAEK says, is that
Party leaders are apt to take advantage of
the loyalty of chaps like HART DYKE, and
purchase with prizes that should be theirs
the allegiance of shiftier men.
Businat done. — Education Eesolutions
carried by Closure.
Thnriday.—There is dolour at Knights-
bridge, woe in Albany Street and the
sound of wailing. The fiat has gone forth.
The word was spoken to-day simultane-
ously in Lords and Commons. The Guards,
or some of them, all in turn, are to go to
Gibraltar. Brave men turn pale at the
thought. Hearts that never beat a moment
faster to the music of the cannon feebly
throb. Suppose there isn't a pluckier man
alive than PAUL SANDFORD, Lord MBTHUEN.
For these twenty years past he has eagerly
snuffed the battle-smoke wheresoever it
has arisen. Far off Beohuanaland knows
the snorting of "Methuen's Horse." Its
broad veldts have trembled to the tread of
their irresistible onslaught. Yet to-night,
MBTHUBN, rising in the harmless, if not
necessary. House of Lords, was so un-
manned by the shock, so overcome by
emotion, that he actually addressed the
paralyzed Peers as "Gentlemen " 1 Not
that the case is otherwise, but the etiquette
of the place demands another form of ad-
dress.
When report first got wind that three
battalions of the Guards were to be sta-
tioned in the Mediterranean. Albany Street
and Knightsbridge were suffused with feel-
ing of patriotic satisfaction. Naturally
concluded that Malta was intended.
Malta a sort of better-class Eel Pie Island
set in the Blue Mediterranean, with troops
of friends bound East or West looking in,
with the Fleet at band, and good company
assured. Not quite the same thing as
Mayfair in the season. Still, consciousness
that one is serving his country, protect ing
the Empire, makes amends for much. But
Gibraltar! Fancy leaving London in the
high season to yawn through May, June,
and July on a blasted rock, Society being
chiefly represented by the aboriginal apes
who people its caverns! Moreover than
which, there is no nlace at Gib to ma-
noeuvre, the men will mope; the battalion
will deteriorate; and all for what P The
Guards die, but never surrender. And now
they 're to go to Gibraltar!

yards and other political topics of hour, apt
to forget that he was one of the most bril-
liant men of his day at Balliol; First Class
in Classics, Newdigate Prizeman, Chan-
cellor's Prizeman for English Essay, and
much else. Uuiversity education doesn't
count for much in our democratic days.
Now Mr. G. has left us, few men are bold
enough to venture on claasical Quotation.
A year or two ago, " MABON," it is true,
addressing the House lightly dropped into
the Welsh tongue. But that not quite the
same thing. OSBOHNR MORGAN can, I be-
lieve, talk Welsh with the pure Machyn-
lleth accent. That he is as fully master of
the Latin tongue as if he had studied it
with VIRGIL in "unhappy Cremona" is
proved by the little volume from the Uni-
versity Press PRINCE ARTHUR brought
down with him to-night to study whilst
HICKS-BBACH terrified SQUIRE OF MAI/-
WOOD with prospect of new expedition to
Soudan.
The Welsh G. 0. M. has tackled the
Eclogues of VIRGIL, and, disdaining earlier
expediencies, has done them into English
in the bard's own metre. Of course the re-
sult is uneven. So is the pathway up
Snowdon and Parnassus. How charming it
may be made let these three perfect lines
from the fifth Eclogue testify:
Sweeter to me tnat song than the rising breath of
the South wind,
Sweeter than music made by the wave-beaten
ehores of the ocean,
Sweeter than pebbly streams through rock-built
valleys descending.
Plenty more like them in the volume.
Business done.—Pay up costs of last
year's Soudan Expedition, and prepare for
another.

Wero some one to devise a test

SIR,—The proposal so nobly suggested by
His Royal Highness the Prince of WALES
will doubtless strike a responsive chord in
the heart of every Briton. The welfare of
pur suffering brethren in the Hospitals is
indeed an object worthy of our best endea-
vours. This fact will justify us in remind-
ing your readers that the chances of re-
covery from illness are often imperilled by
the unwholesome nourishment given to the
patients, especially when they are ordered
to take cocoa. You would hardly believe,
Sir, the number of inferior brands of this
commodity with which the market is
flooded. How, then, could the British
public better commemorate the glorious
reign of our beloved QUEEN than by pur-
chasing for every hospital in the kingdom

and Refreshing Cocoa manufactured only

SIR,—My major says that he had an ex-
tra week's holiday in 1887 because of thp
Jubilee. Since_ then, as old EUCLID would
say, this year is greater than the Jubilee,
much more then we must have an extra
fortnight at least added to the Summer

do all of us. Why not abolish it? I Ve got

SIR,—It is to be hoped that the coming
"commemoration," as it is called, will not
witness a repetition of the idiotic features
which disgraced the Jubilee ten years ago.
3n that occasion, I was expected to provide
board and lodging for one of my idle sons
for a whole week beyond the already ex-
cessive length of the summer holidays.
This is all very pleasant for the school-
master, but it is disgraceful that the un-
happy parents should be burdened in this

notable, and it could easily be effected by

way. Why should not this year mark a shortening by a month or so the vacations

and elsewhere. Hoping that the head-
masters will have the sense to act on this
suggestion, Yours obediently,

SIR,—The present year deserves imper-
ishable record in the annals of time. And
how is such record to be given? By a few

FOR ST. VALENTINE'S DAY AND THE PURVEYORS OF POPULAR VERSE.
[Mr. J. J. Goode informs the Daily Chronicle representative that “during
the past two or three years the valentine has been looking up in the most
promising fashion."]
People's Poet-Laureate loquitur :-
Well, I'm glad to hear that! Of late years they've been flat,
and you'd hardly twig what one in twenty meant,
But this news seems to prove that those Pessimist prigs have not
quite banished humour and sentiment.
I feared that the age had thrown off fun and feeling as oft a she-
falcon will her jesses,
And that the last home of the smile and the tear, in our town,
was good old MOORE and BURGESS's.
With faces cork-blacked, and by instruments backed, men might
still pose as—well, men of feeling,
But for the most part the dear old human heart seems in process
of rapid congealing.
That sweet bardiet, BUNN, of whom cynics made fun, was what
I call the typical poet,

Would not suit the filagree fripperies dear to the soul of an
old-fashioned lover.
An amorous couple, slim-waisted and supple, who stroll up a

Towards a toy-church in the distance—that was in old “Philis-

Would now, like old crockery, meet with huge mockery. Never-

Bobby. "MOTHEB! IF THAT GENTLEMAN ONLY KNEW IT, HE MIGHT TAKB OFF HIS MUZZLE NOW, MIGHTN'T HE?"
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
"WHAT this book wants," Miss MARY
KLNGSLEY writes by way of introduction to
her Travels in Weft Africa (MACMILLAN),
"is not a simple preface, but an apology."
What it really wants ia cutting down by at
least two hundred pages. It is a marvellous
story of a woman's courage, enterprise, en-
durance, and other qualities which mere
man has been in the habit of claiming as
his exclusive birthright. The woman, my
Baronite whispers to me, is betrayed in the
copiousness of language that enlarges the
volume to 027 pages, not counting appen-
dices. That grumble discharged, there re-
mains nothing but praise for the book and
of admiration for its author. She has a
keen eye for character, an abiding sense of
the picturesque, a humour that bubbles
over in all places and predicaments, and a
graphic pen, whose unfailing flow some-
times carries her a little far afield.
Now that CALVEKLEY is no more, Mr.
OWEN SEAMAN is his own most dangerous
rival. He has excelled himself in The
Battle of the Bays, A parody, unless done
by a master hand, is a poor thing. In
this little volume the master hand is visi-
ble in every line. Of the nine Muses who
compete in the contest it is difficult to say
which contributes more to the delight of
the reader. My Baronite inclines to the
study of Sir EDWIN ARNOLD, whose fine
poetic style is exceedingly tempting to the
wickedly inclined. That is a matter of
taste. The taster will find all toothsome.
What the subjects of Mr. SEAMAN'S satire
think of his work is, as one of them when
he writes in prose is occasionally prone to
observe, "another' story." The exercise
kindly provided should be useful to them
as the Rontgen rays in the hands of a
skilled physician throw priceless light on
other human diseases and malformations.
It is one of Mr. SEAMAN'S minor japes that
his book is published at the Bodley Head,
at which he occasionally girds.

highly decorative elu ct produced, it would make it as easy to know " who 's

like, were added, '.In Eligible would be easily distinguished from the Ineli-

No. VIII.—OF ROWING —Or COPY-BOOK MAXIMS —OF SPORTINO
PAPERS IN DELATION TO MOTHERS—OF MOTHERS IN RELATION
TO ROWING—OF PRESIDENTS OF BOAT CLUBS.
My DEAB JACK,—So you are rowing in the Lent Boat of your
College, and have begun, to taste the delights of hard training?
The seats, you say, are hard, and the food, though plentiful,
strikes you as lacking in variety. No matter: when the races
are over and you have humped your way to glory, you will re-
turn with an added zest to the cakes, the ice-puddings, and the
various other luxuries of ordinary civilised life. In the mean-
time, proceed in your virtuous career of glowing exercise and
manly honest fatigue, and learn how to subordinate your own
particular desires to the general good of your crew. The copy-
book maxims of your childhood will assume a new and startling
force and applicability. The saying, for instance, that health,
wealth and wisdom might be expected from early bed-going and
early rising has appeared to you as nothing more than a pale and
effete generalisation. You will now realise its meaning in the
state of your wind and your muscles after you have smitten
the sounding furrows of the Cam in a practice course from Baits-
bite to the finish. And as for wealth, though you will not at
one stroke (or even at forty) become a millionaire, yet, since
rowing is a cheap amusement, and by its very nature forbids all
pocket for having joined the company of oarsmen. ^1 understand
that you recently sent to your mother a copy of The Field, in
which your crew was referred to as being "distinctly promising,
and it was further stated that "one or two of their freshmen,
notably No. 6, shape very well." This thoughtless act on your
part has roused a passion for oarsmanship in your mother's gentle
breast. She who formerly confined her reading to the births,
marriages and deaths in The Times, now takes in and studies with
avidity the Sportsman and the Sporting TAfe, and complains that
too much attention is paid to the University Crews, and too little
to the doings of the Cambridge Lent Boats. She also learns
incidentally in the course of her reading that "In answer to JAKE
GINGER'S challenge, young BOSSY will be only too pleased to box
him if Messrs. KNOCKOUT and TOM MITTENS will provide a purse,'
or that "A Gentleman of Brixton is willing to match his linnet
against Mo CLARKE'S from £2 up to £5. Business only meant,
or again, that, "Jo MIDDLEHAM requests both old and new
patrons to remit twenty-four stomps for his brilliant special tor
the Dust Park Handicap. Fear nothing. Lightning Results.
Into these green pastures of literature your dear mother has
turned herself loose. I very much fear that on your return
home you will find her a changed woman, and I have thought it
my duty in some measure to prepare you for the shock. But as
to athletics and the part their sons play in them all mothers
behave in the same way. They delight to torture their innocent
hearts by conjuring up imaginary dangers cunningly calculated
to enhance the splendour and matchless daring of their sons.
Your mother has, of course, warned you that you must wear thick
underclothing when you row so as to diminish the risk of catching
cold, that you must on no account overexert yourself, that you
must drink your hot posset before you turn in for the night, and
never fail to change both your boots and your socks when you
come back to your rooms from the river. Perhaps you think your
mother is exceptional in her anxieties. Not a bit of it. The
President of the University Boat Club is an embodiment of awe
and majesty. Note how the passers-by point his noble form out
to one another as he treads the streets on his way to the boat-
house every afternoon. He holds the fate of oarsmen in his
bands. How impassively he rejects one or calls upon another,
with how solemn an alacrity do his crew obey his slightest behest!
He orders a course, and a course is rowed: he tells No. 5 that
he is rowing atrociously short, and No. 5 feels that his life has
been robbed of joy and his future days doomed to despair. The
man is more than human. Yet this exalted being has a mother,
and at this moment, if the truth could be revealed, he has in his
pocket a letter from that lady, in which she announces the dis-
patch of three pairs of warm stockings, and implores him to re-
tire from the crew at the first sign of fatigue, reminding him that
as a child of four he was always susceptible to coughs, and that
the family doctor quite agrees with her that rowing is too severe
an exercise for young men. So, after all, even Presidents of
University Boat Clubs, earth-shakers and cloud-compellers though
they may appear, are human, too—on the mother's side, and I 11
warrant that if this particular President took his mother at her
word, gave up his seat in the boat and retired to a life of in-
glorious cotton-wool and comfort there would be no more miser-
able woman in the world than the mother who had urged him to
the fatal deed. In the meantime, therefore, if you wish to
please your mother, I advise you to continue rowing, and to do
your best when the time comes to help your crew to make a bump
every night of the races.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAKIVARL
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIAKT OP TOBT, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, February 8.
—Looking in again at House at eleven
o'clock to-night, weighed down with heavi-
ness that comes of listening to seven hours'
debate on Army Administration, hardly
knew old friend AMELIUS RICHARD MARK
LOCKWOOD, late Lieutenant-Colonel of the
Ooldstreams, now Member for the West (or
Epping) Division of Essex. On ordinary
occasions no more cheery presence in the
House than that of MARK LOCKWOOD.
With hat tilted back from expansive brow,
hands in trousers' pockets, a smile on his
face and a jest on his lips, he is better on a
foggy day than a jet of electric light.
Seen at his best in domestic circle of his
learned kinsman, FRANK LOCKWOOD, Q.C.
On Christmas Day and Twelfth Night the
numerous progeny at Lennox Gardens,
delight above all others in Uncle MAHK.
with his pockets bulging with bonbons,
his coat-tails stored with rocking-horses,
portable steam-engines, and Noah's Arks,
with elephants cunningly constructed so
that they may with prehensile trunk take
up in turn SIIEM, HAM, and JAPHET, and
trot them round the back parlour of the Ark.
To-night Uncle MARK transformed. His
very voice altered. A chill, ropellant air
of business warns jesters off. Fact is, he
has prepared a paper on "The Iniquity of
Sending the Guards to Gibraltar." Under-
taken to read it before United Service
Institution—I mean the House of Commons.
Hour has struck, and here is the man; a
grave and reverend seigneur, profoundly

"Uncle Mark." (Colonel L-ckw-d.)

"CELEBRITIES MOKE OR LESS AT HOME!" (No. 1.)
A man's idiosyncrasies can best be judged when one sees him in the atmosphere of home. Colonel
H-w-rd V-nc-nt is most particular that the eiact origin of every article should be PLAINLY marked
upon it!!
impressed with danger to empire imminent
mi threatened deportation of Guards. A
very good paper it was too, Uncle MARK
i 'vidently having whole of question at finger
ends, and knowing how to put its best
pnints forward.
But, as I mentioned, hardly recognised
him. Would probably have failed, only
for two thing.?. One was recognition of
tho red flower of a blameless life overworn
in his button-hole. The other, the way in
which he declaimed the sentence, "Lord
>[ETHUEN, speaking in the House of Lords
the other night, damned the War Office
plan with faint praise."
Used in this connection the verb is quite
Parliamentary, a trite quotation. But the
emphasis Uncle MARK managed, perhaps
unconsciously, to throw upon the little
word startled the House. SPEAKER in-
stinctively clasped arms of chair with ges-
ture as if to rise. J. G. TALBOT'S face
clouded with expression of extreme pain.
But before anything could be done Uncle
MARK had trotted on, showing how the
average height in the Guards is five foot ten
and an eighth; how it is difficult to pre-
serve that standard when trade is depressed;
and how when, under a Conservative Go-
vernment, trade is improving, the eighth
of an inch must go, and with it one of the
bulwarks of the British Constitution.
/Justness done. — Army Estimates dis-
cussed.
Tuesday.—SAM SMITH is a man of war.
The accidents of birth and business associa-
tion lodged him in an ungarrisoned town,
and connected him with the cotton trade.
Nature meant him for a Guardsman. Had
he chanced to have been in South Africa
when preparations for the famous expedi-
tion ALFRED AUSTIN hymned were to tho
fore he would have been torn by conflicting
emotions. Instinctively he would shrink
from the moral obliquity of the business;
but his right hand would have itched for
touch of the rifle-stock, his loft for tho
bridle-rein. In the mind's eye one sees
him riding forth on a better errand, booted
and spurred, his heart full of courage and
his belt of cartridges, his tawny beard
shining under Afric's sun, serving for his
gallant followers the part played in another
fight in other days by the plume of HENRY
of Navarre.
Accidents, as aforesaid, have directed
SAMUEL'S feet in the pathways of peace.
But hot blood will bubble. To-day he
loads a forlorn hope against tho citadel of
the Church. For what timorous men dis-
cuss as tactical reasons no worse time
could have been chosen for such enterprise.
That is sufficient for SAMUEL SMITH. Let
others seek even chances. For him the
hopelessness of hostile odds is lure irre-
sistible. So he comes up to-night with
resolution demanding instant disestablish-
ment of the Church, not only in Wales,
but in England. The mercenaries of the
Front Opposition Bench retire to their
tents; instruct the orderly if anyone calls
to say they 're "not at ho:n"." When the
heroic figure of S. S. presents itself above
the gangway, holding in rod right hand a
scroll of manuscript notes which mean a
speech at least an hour long, tho rank and
file of either camp fold their tents like the
Arab and as silently steal away.

[FEBRUARY 20, 1897.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SAMUEL cares for none of these things.
In the calm solitude of his study he has
prepared a speech of prodigious length.
Topic not entirely new; does not at the
moment inflame public mind with interest.
"What of that? S. S. has the first place in
the order of proceedings; the House—at
least the Speaker, the Sergeant-at-Arms,
the door-keepers, and the benches—are at
his mercy. Perhaps, if he has his oratiou
neatly type-written, and sends it to the
morning papers, they will gladly allot the
three columns of space necessary to its
verbatim printing. Anyhow, he'll read
his screed from first page to last. If the
Sergeant-at-Arms goes to sleep in his chair
his blood be on his own head.
Business done.—Mr. SAMUEL SMITH pro-
poses disestablishment and disendowment
of Church of England. House yawned
through two hours and a half. In midst
of yawn of really dangerous stretch found
itself counted out.
Thursday.—Mr. WEIR, temporarily with-
drawn from forefront of Parliamentary life
for reason everyone regrets, is back again,
bringing his sheaves of questions with him.
Has in leisure time cultivated added sepul-
ohralnesa of voice. Ever when he came to
the crux of his question—whether it related
to delayed delivery of telegram between
Sanda and Stronsa, whether it touched on
sewage at Stromness, or whether it retold
some story of town council iniquity that
had of late lifted with indignation the hair
on Duncansby Head—his voice was heard
apparently issuing from bis boots.
To-night indignation deeper than usual;
righteous wrath profounder; his voice ha.1
sought even lower level. Seems as if he
had contrived to secure a portable sub-
terraneous apartment, standing on whicl
he addresses House. You see him rise; re-
gard House to right and left with severe
look; fish out pince-nez from his bosom;
with wide sweep of right arm place it on
hia nose. Then is heard a subterraneous
rumbling which, gradually rising to level of
his boots, becomes more or less articulate.
His soul just now seared by PRINCF
ARTHUR'S iniquity in appropriating time of
private Members for purposes of Education
Bill. He has first place next Tuesday for
an epoch-making resolution. A Ministry
that has not feared to flout France and rile
Russia on Egyptian question recks nothing?
of an act of petty larceny at expense of
GALLOWAY WEIR. But they shall hear from
him; and they do, though withal indis-
tinctly, owing to the subterranean oratori-
cal convenience hinted at. After rumbling
had gone on for five minutes, sometimes
spluttering above cellar lid, qftener falling
hopelessly below it, SPEAKER interposed.
"I have great difficulty in hearing the
hon. Member, but," he added, blandly, "I
am under the impression that he is out of
order."
House roared with delight at this novel
application from the Chair of the process
of induction. The shaft went home; the
rumbling noise proceeded for a few minuter
with growing hesitancy; it ceased, and
Members looking up discovered that Mr.
WEIR, having apparently finished his
speech, had resumed his seat.

cation Bill moved.

FOUR. It appears that WILLIAM O'BRIEN
—and really we didn't know it till LON-
DONDERRY gave him bold advertisement—
has been making a speech in Ireland de-
nouncing land-grabbing. W. O'B. must do
something. An Irish politician cannot live
by the memory of shed breeches, disposed
of in whatsoever patriotic circumstance.
With TIM HEALY starting a new daily paper,
JOHN_ DILLON'S name appearing every
morning in the Parliamentary reports,
and JOHN REDMOND coming home, other
patriots must do something.
From the battlements of his castellated
home in Ireland WILLIAM O'BRIEN waves
towards Lord LONDONDERRY a handkerchief
wet with grateful tears. His noble friend
made him the subject of debate in the
House of Lords, where TIM'S name hasn't
been mentioned in the present Parliament,
and DILLON'S is never heard.
True, LONDONDERRY not thinking of
O'BRIEN; wanted to strike at GERALD BAL-
FOUR with back-handed blow at PRINCE
ARTHUR. When the latter was Chief Sec-
retary, he said, speeches of this kind were
promptly followed bv indictment. Now
GERALD holds the office treason (to land-
lords) stalks with impunity. As to which
is right let the brothers settle between
themselves.
This all very well for outburst of ex-vice-
regal temper. But in beating at the
BALFOTTRS the Marquis has simply suc-
ceeded in obliging O'BRIEN.

AT THE HUNT BALL.
(TJic Sat! Complaint of a Man in Blaek.)
O MOLLY, dear, my head, I fear, is going round and round,
Your cousin isn't in the hunt, when hunting men abound;
A waltz for me no more you '11 keep, the girls appear to think
There 's a law been made in favour of the wearing of the pink.
Sure I met you in the passage, and I took you by the hand.
And snys I, " How many dances. MOLLY, darlint, will ye stand?"
But your card was full, you said it with a most owdacious wink,
And I 'm "hanging" all ymir partners for the wearing of the
pink!
You 'd a waltz for CHARLIE THKUSTER, but you "d divil a one for
me,
Though he dances like a steam-engine, as all the world may see;
'Tis an illigant divarsion to observe the crowd divide.
As he plunges down the ball-room, taking couples in his stride.
Tisa cropper you '11 be coming, but you know your business best,
Still, it's bad to see you romping round with CHARLIE and the
rest;
Now you 're dancing with Lord ARTHUR—sure, he 's had enough
to dhrink—
And I 'm "hanging" all your partners for the wearing of the
pink!
Your cruelty ashamed you '11 be someday to call to mind,
You 'II be glad to ask my pardon, then, for being so unkind.
The hunting men are first, to-night—well, let them have their
whack—
You '11 be glad to dance with me, someday—when all the coats
are black!
But, since pink 's the only colour now that fills your pretty head,
Bedad, I 'II have some supper, and then vanish home to bed.
'Tis the most distressful ball-room I was ever in, I think,
And I 'm "hanging" all your partners for the wearing of the
pink!
AFTER THE ESTIMATES ARE OVER,
(Page from " Th', Story of the Invasion of England in ]9—.")
DOVER had fallen. The coal-minea discovered in the bed be-
neath the abandoned Channel Tunnel were supplying the in-
vaders with unlimited fuel. Ramsgate, always gay, was (although
in the hands of the enemy) the scene of a most exciting regatta.
Margate was fairly cheerful, and if Herne Bay were dull its con-
dition was only normal. The Fleet, owing to a fault in the
machinery, was on its way to the West Indies. Instead of
"Attack the Enemy," the signal had been given, "Fly to
Jamaica." Immediately at full speed (two hundred and fifty
knots an hour) the battleships had departed in the wrong direc-
tion. The breakdown of the engine in the signalling-room on the
AdmiraTs flagship rendered the summons of recall practically
impossible. So the coast of England, left unguarded by its
nautical defenders, had fallen an easy prey to the foreign hosts.
True the Guards had done their best, receiving from time to
time telephonic messages of encouragement from their comrades
at Gibraltar. True the Line had supported the Household
Brigade most admirably. True the Militia (represented by the
7th Rifle Brigade and the 4th Cheshire) and the Volunteers (in
the persons of the Inns of Court and the 3rd Middlesex Artillery)
had performed prodigies of valour. But it had been of no avail.
The South coast was in the hands of the enemy, and Eastern
Scarborough and Western Cardiff were trembling to their founda-
tions.
No time was lost by the invaders to march on London. They
paused for a moment to inspect Canterbury Cathedral (courte-
ously thrown open by the Dean and Chapter), and spent a few
days in the novel amusement of sea-bathing at Birchington.
But after this the advance became a stern matter of business
rather than a pleasure excursion. Place after place fell as the
army approached. Every town, every village proved to be
empty. There were no inhabitants, and as a natural conse-
quence no provisions. When the invading commander-in-chief
reached Chatham he was more than hungry. This town, like the
others, was deserted. All the restaurants were closed, and every
tavern dismantled. Suddenly there was a shout of ioy. An enor-
mous warehouse, marked with the Government "broad arrow,"
was found crammed with provisions. The invaders sat down to
a hearty breakfast. Full of renewed energy they started, and at
St. Mary Cray (reached at 1 P.M.) discovered a second empo-
rium. They lunched adequately, and found a third at Herne
Hill, and stayed at that delightful spot for dinner. An easy
stroll in the cool of the evening brought them to Brixton, where
they found a building like its fellows replete with every gastro-
nomic luxury. They enjoyed their supper. The next morning
when the advancing host marched upon 85, Fleet Street (where
serious opposition was expected), the commander-in-chief of the
aliens expressed his entire satisfaction with the arrangements of
the Government of 1897 in establishing "block-houses" for the
sustenance of invaders en route for London.

ME. DRTJRY FORTNUM'S historical treatise of the glazed and

in the matter of majolica. "Mniolica," he, as precise in matters
of spelling as was Sam Welkr's father, names the volume turned
out with the perfected art peculiar to the Oxford University
Press. The objects critically and historically considered are the
glazed and enamelled pottery produced in Italy during the latter
decades of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. To the connois-
seur or collector the book is invaluable. The untutored reader
grows fascinated as he turns over the pages, and learns all about
these gems of a lost and irreparable art. My Baronite learns
with regret that there are nefarious dealers who "cook" repro-
ductions of the ancient wares with intent to make them look
old, and pass them off on the unwary as originals. They have
evidently no chance with Mr. FORTNTJM. The volume is enriched

to say a few kind words to me every morning, and told her mis-
tress, and she said if she ever heard of it happening again, I
should be sent away without a character.
Mr. Woth. Sent away! Gracious heavens, what possible
harm can there be in just--
Mercy. I can't think. But she said I ought not to allow a
stranger to talk to me like that. As if I could help it!
Mr. Woth. Why, it was the merest chance. I had been taking
a rest on this seat-it was a very hot morning, I remember-and
I should have got up and gone on without even noticing you were
there, only you happened to drop your ball of knitting, or what-
ever it was, and, naturally, I picked it up.
Mercy. I told her exactly how it was; but she said that no
honourable gentleman would take such notice of a girl in my
position, unless-unless-no, I can't go on.
Mr. Woth. (indignantly). What vile minds some people-
No, MERCY my dear, she's right, I'm afraid ; right, at least, as
the world goes. I've acted foolishly, wrongly. I ought to
have thought that, even at my time of life If you had
only told me all this before! I would have gone away, anything
rather than-
Mercy. I know. But-but I didn't want to lose the only friend

Mr. Woth. (remorsefully). I meant to be your friend, my dear;
but the truest friendship I can show you now is to go away. I
can't let you run any further risk of losing your situation.
Mercy. Oh, I've lost that by this time.
Mr. Woth. Lost it! How
Mercy. You remember that woman passing just now; that was
ANNETTE, the French maid. She canne on purpose to spy upon
me, and by the time I take Baby home--
Mr. Woth. (in deep distress). It's devilish, perfectly devilish!
And to think that I-- But, my poor child, what will you do?
Mercy (recklessly). Oh, I don't know. I shan't go into service
again. Get an engagement as barmaid, perhaps, or else as chorus
girl. I can sing a little, and I've been told I've rather a good
figure. I shall get along somehow.
Mr. Woth. No, no, you mustn't do that. I-I couldn't stand
it. ... (With a sudden impulse.) MERCY, I–I thought I felt
nothing but a sort of fatherly interest in you; but I know now
it was more than that, it's more than that. And—my dear, if
you can only care enough for me to—to be-my wife. . .. I
wouldn't for the world put any kind of pressure upon you, or-
or seem to take any advantage; but, upon my word, I don't see
what else can be done. If you would like time to think over it
carefully-
Mercy. As if I wanted any time to think over that! Why, of
course I'll be your wife, as soon as ever you choose!
LATER.
Mr. Woth. (to himself, as he walks on alone). I can hardly believe
it. No more idea when I started this morning And after all
these years, too! But I'd no alternative-no alternative; and
I don't see why we shouldn't be exceedingly happy. It isn't as if
dear little MERCY was an ordinary-- Still, there's HENRIETTA.
I'm afraid I may have some trouble with HENRIETTA at first.
However, it will make no real difference to her.
Mercy (to the child, as she wheels it home). Baby, you little beast,
you won't have me for your slave much longer, do you know that ?
Ah, you may well waggle that slack-baked little apple-dumpling
of a head of yours. I did manage it well, didn't I, Baby? But I
don't believe I should ever have got him to the point, if ANNETTE
hadn't happened-- That gave me the idea. How she would
laugh if I told her, only I'm not such a goose! He's a dear simple
old thing, and he swallowed it all. I'm really fond of him, in a
way, and he 'll let me do exactly as I please. And the first thing
I shall do after we are married is to get that sister of his out of
the house!
KRÜGER'S LITTLE CLAIM.

THAT odd sixteen-and-ninepence is the latest Boer joke,
Enough to make the Uitlander with fits of laughter choke!
What is it charged for? we may well inquire of Uncle PAUL,
The items should be specified and made quite clear to ail.
Is it, perhaps, the moral loss inflicted by the T-m-s,
When printing thirteen months ago the Poet-Laureate's rhymes ?
Is it since Mr. RHODES's tongue has been a little rude,
In talking at a recent date of “unctuous rectitude"?
Or, can it be the net result of the Emperor's telegram ?
We crave for further details, or we'll think the bill's a sham!
However, when accounts like this are sent, 'tis pretty plain,
Some intellectual damage has been done to KRUGER's brain i

Tales in School.
It is suggested, it seems, that a school should be started for
giving “vocal lessons in the art of story-writing.” Splendid
notion! One difficulty, however, suggests itself to Mr. Punch!
Everybody writes stories now—with or without lessons. As we
are "all Socialists” (as Sir William HARCOURT said) so we are
all story-writers now. It is to be feared therefore that, as the
celebrated German regiment was “all officers," so that projected
Story-writing School would be all teachers and no pupils.

HAVE just heard of the Council's pro-
posal now before Parliament to continue
tlio Chelsea Embankment beyond Bat-
tersea Bridge. Discover article on it in
Times of the 2nd. It seems there is a
graceful curve of the river bank there, open
space, old-fashioned houses, picturesque
barges, brown sails, HOGARTH'S "Line of
beauty," and all that sort of thing. Now,
I'm a practical man, and hate all such
useless tomfoolery. Rejoice to see the
Council wants to make the bank quite
straight. So much more practical. Get
the Thames like a wide canal. "Line of
beauty" all rubbish. Also to build on
open space, concealing old-fashioned houses
by practical new ones. Probably lofty
flats. How much better than having a
silly garden with flowers, or anything of
that maudlin sort. The scheme will cost
a lot. That's unfortunate. Not so very
practical. But you can't make improve-
ments for nothing.
Begin to think what might be done in
other parts. There'- an astonishing lot
of waste space in London. Look at Tra-
falgar Square. Who goes in the middle?
Why not build the new Council Hall there?
And look at the Parks. What's the good
of the Serpentine? Nothing but water I
Why not drain it and build workmen's
dwellings? Then look at the Bayswater
Road and the Kensington Road. Both
quite crooked. Make them quite straight,
and build houses all along the Park—good
practical houses, all exactly alike and in
a straight line. Look at Kensington Gar-
dens. Nothing but a lot of trees! Cut
them all down and build on the ground.
Do the same with all the Parks. The land
would sell for enormous sums. Then the
present streets could be dealt with, and all
the chief ones could bo made quite straight,
and quite flat, and 150 feet wide, with four
lines of steam tramways along each.
That's what I should like. That's what
I call practical. Don't tell me any rub-
bish about Piccadilly being better as it is.
Why, all the houses are different I And all
the building land on one side is wasted for
the sake of some old trees! And the road
varies in width, and it isn't flat! And
there isn't even one tramway I Stuff and
nonsense, I say.
So I 'm glad the Council is going to
build on one open space, and is trying to
get the Thames rather straighter. It's a
good beginning.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
E.XTKACTED FROM THE DlAHY OP TOBY, M.P.
House of Comment, Mnnday, February 15.
—Afraid when I saw FRANK LOCKWOOD
industriously taking notes through to-
night's debate on Education Bill, he would
miss opportunity of making successful
speech. Rude to mention names; but
House well knows some of his colleagues
on Front Opposition bench whose speeches
are smothered—"Overlain" SARK calls it
—by preparation. Fortunately House
pretty full when the Solicitor-General of
when closely examined, there is really
nothing in the speech to which exception
could he taken. One can imagine how the
MARKISS, studying the newspaper report,
would be puzzled to understand the occa-
sion of the "laughter," "loud laughter,"
"renewed laughter," recorded at every
other sentence. On any other stage,
in any other circumstances, before any
other audience, the speech would have
been an ordinary official effort. But cir-
cumstances were compact: the actor, the
moment, the stage, the audience.
Rusintss done.—The Vice-President ex-
I themselves outside, These dozen, faithful
among the faithless found, scorn delights
'and live laborious quarters of an hour listen-
i ing to GENTLE-DULNESS. Mrs. G.-D. and
'the Misses G.-D , surveying the scene from
Ladies' Gallery, are cheered by this sign of
appreciation. They have never been able
to make out how it is that Pa, so wise at
home, so authoritative on imperial politics
and domestic questions, so persuasive in
i his eloquence, so unanswerable in his
'argument, shotild be so little regarded in
the House of Commons. Here are at least
a doxen who know his full value.

GOfiST, ET riLETEKEA NIHIL!
"I do not know that I have a right to speak for my right hon. friend the First Loid of the Treasury, who is not here at present, but I can speak as far
as the COMMITTEE of Council is concerned!"..." Tile Committee of Council are a BODY of very practical men!"—Sir J-nn O-rst in Education Debate,
two successive Governments rose. Drew
hilarious cheer at outset by chaff of
JOHN o' GORST. Afterwards all went well;
severely disregarding his brief, he spoke
brightly, effectively, on subject with which
he is intimately familiar; scored unequi-
vocal success.
JOHN o' GORST to follow. Long time
since House seen such delightful bit of
high comedy. Everything perfect—the
passive figure, the almost wooden expres-
sion on the face as the cheers and laughter
rose and fell; the subtle modulation of the
voice investing innocent syllables with
barbed point. Nothing lacking, not even
PRINCE ARTHUR, evidently anxious but
keenly appreciative, seated close by his
docile colleague. If JOHN o' GORST had
in early life taken to the stage, JOHNNIE
HARE would have had to look out for his
laurels. The crowning success is that,
plains what the Committee of the Privy
Council think.
Tuesday. — No one looking at House to-
night when debate on Education Bill was
resumed would guess how, outside, the
great heart of the nation was throbbing
with excitement. Benches almost empty;
listless attitude of scanty audience varied
here and there by figure of Member
leaning forward with hand on knee intently
watching honourable gentleman on his legs.
About a dozen of these, an appreciable
proportion of the so-called House.
The kindly heart yearns towards them.
Here, at least, are good men and true, who
take profound interest in education ques-
tion; are willing to add from any source to
their knowledge of subject. The authority
just now on his legs may be prosy and prag-
matical. Less conscientious Members have
fled before him, more pleasantly occupying
As he approaches conclusion of eloquent
and convincing harangue the twelve Mem-
; bers can hardly contain themselves. They
strain like hounds on the leash ; they never
take their eyes off Pa; seem, ready to eat
i him in excess of their appreciation. Once,
when Pa stooped down to pick up one of
the folios of his precious speech, they all
leaped to their feet as if propelled by the
same catapult. When Pa, having found
his paper, went on with his speech, the
House tittered and they ruefully resumed
their seats.
Mrs. GENTLE-DULNESS growing alarmed.
"I hope," she says nervously, "theyaren't
in their enthusiasm going to do anything
foolish: lift Pa up shoulder high, and
carry him. round the House in triumph, or
anything of that kind."

legs makes an end of speaking, the doze"'

sistible. Akin to case of arbitrary usher
accidentally encountering lot of the boys
in mid holiday. Time, near Christmas;
scene, a lonely common a foot deep in
snow. Could the boys be blamed if a
storm of snowballs darkens the air, or
even if a human figure, outwardly rever-
enced in term time, is rolled in the snow?
Something like this happened in case of
esteemed Chairman of Committees. MAPLE
BI.UNDELL, putting down his head, butted
him (so to speak) in the stomach. COHEN
blocked his hat. DARLING, getting hold of
his coat-tails, violently tugged them, con-
tumeliously shouting, "Yah! yah!" As
for Cap'en TOMMY, he sailed round and
round, dexterously dipping his main brace
so as to souse the right honourable gentle-
man with water. SQUIRE op MALWOOD,
who has not recently had opportunity of
appearing in favourite character of Pro-
tector of Ministers, gallantly ran in with
attempt to drive the boys off. Too late.
The fun was over; a mere wreck of a
Chairman of Committees limped off to the
glad obscurity of his room.
Business done.—OOM PAUL presents his
small account. Item: to material damage,

lectual damage, say a million. What a

Friday.—Long hours and a dull evening
with Army Estimates illumined by single
gleam. It flashed when WILFRID LAWSON
and Dr. TANNER walked up floor shoulder
to shoulder, co-tellers in a division. Chair-
man of Committees deftly compounded the
mixture.
"Only wants a bit of ice to make it quite
complete," said SARK, wetting his lips, for,
as hinted, the proceedings had been dry.
With brief intervals spent outfflde.TAK-
NER has pervaded the place since House
got into Committee. "Knowing nothing
of the matter," he said, at one point of
discussion on Yecmanry vote; "I speak
with diffidence—great diffidence, Mr.
LO\VTHER." Nevertheless, he spoke often;
divided at every opportunity. Had taken
one division on reduction of Yeomanry
Vote, when WILFRID LAWSON, "going one
step farther," as WALTER BARTTELOT used
to say, moved rejection of whole vote.
Chairman gave him several chances.
"I think the Ayes have it." "The Noes
have it," said wilful WILFRID. "The Ayes
have it," repeated the Chairman, in warn-
ing voice. This was the last chance. Every-
one saw what was coming, except LAWSON.
who once more challenged Chairman's de-
cision. Then the bolt fell. "Ayes to the
right; Noes to the left. Tellers for the
Ayes, Sir WILLIAM WALROND and Mr.
ANSTRUTHER; tellers for the Noes, Sir
AVILFBID LAWSON and Dr. TANNBR." House
wont out to division with uproarious glee.
Business done. — Millions voted on ac-
count Army Estimates.
MISUNDERSTOOD!
(A Story of the Road and its Double Fares.)
"And doubtless you have good reason
for charging me a double fare?" queried
the traveller.
"Indeed I have, Sir," was the ready
response. "Our company opponents, on
festivals, take off their vehicles at an early
hour. It is only we—lowly and despised—
keep to our running. Surely for this
boon we deserve some recompense?"
"You are indeed right;" said he who
was journeying, "and this two-pence is
given with every feeling of satisfaction."
"Sir, you touch me nearly. Never have
I been "treated with so much kindness.
Believe me, these tears spring from a
heart fuu almost to breaking with the
warmest gratitude."
"Nay, I did not mean to make you
weep," continued the traveller, ^ wiping
away himself a furtive tear. "You are
civil and obliging, and if you are under
no direct control, I and my fellow-passen-
gers are free from the unpleasant atten-
tions of the inspector thirsting for tickets."
"Ah, Sir. you are indeed a friend!"
exclaimed the emotional attendant; "and
I would ask you one favour more."
"It is granted before demanded."
"A thousand thanks. I would merely
pray of you, when you hear my vehicle de-
scribed in brutal language by a hard-
hearted public, to utter a word in my
defence."
"Willingly. In future, when I have oc-
casion to speak of you, I will call you the
pleasing alternative to the Road Car and
London General."
Then came a shout of joy and a declara-
tion that explained everything.
"Ah, that will be far better than being
known as the conductor of the pirate
'bus!"

[The Ercninq Standard thinks the action of the
British Admiral and his warships in Cretan waters
"should commend itself to every man who can
approach a question of international complication
without frenzied appeals to Providence, Hyde Park,

Of—let us say the minor journalist!

poet,
Are simply out of it, and ought to know it.

And do not turn on sentiment, or "the

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THE New Woman amongst novelists has really left nothing
more to be done. One recently took Satan for her hero. OLIVB
SCHREINER, in Trooper Peter Halket (FISHER UN WIN), has gone
one better, sketching on her canvas the most sacred figure
known to mankind. If the thing must be done it may be ad-
mitted that the difficult task has been accomplished with deli-
cacy and force. It is a noble, majestically-human personage that
appears to Peter Halket in the loneliness of the night on
the veldt. The doubt that disturbs the mind of the reader
is as to the object with which the book is written. My Baronite
is not sure whether the work was undertaken because OLIVB
SCHREINER hates Mr. CECIL RHODES the less, or because she
loves the Kaffir more. Perfectness of art is not compatible with
personal prejudice and exaggeration. Breach of this canon robs
Peter Halket of fall success. The black man is not so white as
he is here painted, nor is the white man nearly so. black. The
cowardly murder of the trooper by his captain, which closes the
story, is savage in its libellous reflection on Mrs. SCHREINBR'S
own countrymen.
"It may frequently happen that an order may be given to an
officer which, from circumstances not known to the person who
gave it at the time he issued it, would be impossible to execute,
or the difficulty or risk of the execution of it would be so great
as to amount to moral impossibility." This passage from one of
the Duke of WELLINGTON s despatches was quoted in the fore-
front of a memorandum from Sir GEORGE THYON issued to the
squadron when he was in command of the Mediterranean station.
The occasion was the disaster to the Howe. Among his own
dicta Sir GEORGE laid down the rule that "risks that are not only
justifiable but are demanded during war are not justifiable during
peace." This from the author and director of the manoeuvre
which, on the 22nd of June, 1893, led to the collision between
the Campe.rdawn and the Victoria, the sinking of the latter
ship, and the wholesale loss of crew and officers, including Sir
GEORGE TRYON, is, my Baronite says, one of the grimmest inci-
dents in biography. In his Life of Sir George Tryon (BLACK-
WOOD), Admiral FITZGERALD surmises that the name of his hero is
known to many of his countrymen only in connection with the
great maritime disaster. That is inevitable, and the fact will
remain till the name ceases to be spoken. In his simply told
and fascinating story Admiral FITZGERALD succeeds in deepening
the mystery that broods over the fatal order. He shews TRYON from
his first appointment as a midshipman on the Wettesley devoting
energy and supreme capacity to the mastery of his loved profession.
He knew everything, and could do anything that became a sailor.
It was, in truth, as Admiral FITZGERALD testifies, the blind trust
confided in him by men and officers that led to the calamity.
He ordered the squadron to manoeuvre on the basis of the
columns being six cables apart. Every cabin-boy knew that
such an arrangement must lead to collision. But everyone
believed TRYON knew what he was about, that, somehow or
other, the thing would come right. So orders were obeyed, and
the Victoria was run down. It was magnificent, but it was not
seamanship. (Signed) THE BARON.
A PASSAGE IN A FLAT.
(By a Stout Man.)
You may doubtless think that I in this title must imply
Something musical, a movement played melodiously at
Any concert you recall. No, it is not that at all,
For the A is not accented in this "passage in a flat.''
And a "movement" there might lead to disasters great indeed;
For unlucky individuals like me a little fat,
With a far too ample waist, it is awkward to be placed
In the very narrow passage found in almost any flat.
All your rooms, my friend, are fine, fit for bulk yet more than
mine,
But the passage is not similar, you could not argue that.
One must be absurdly thin to be comfortable in
Any gangway so contracted as the passage in a flat.
And in yours, by no means wide, you have hung on either side
Some extremely charming drawings which I gaze at from the
mat,
Fearful lest I sweep them all to destruction from the wall,
If I try to struggle past them in the passage of your flat.
At Redrufus Castle.

A STORY IN SCENES.
II.
SCENE— The Terrace of the Spa at Scarborough. It is a fine morning
towards the end of September. The Terrace is not crowded, and most
of those present are leaning over the parapet, listening to the troupes
of Niggers and Pierrots performing on the sands below. Misa HEN-
RIETTA WoTHERsi-ooN and FKITZ VON GUJBLER are walking up and
down together, apart from the rest. She is about forty-five, with hair
that is beginning to turn grey, ordinary features, and an ingenuously
amiable expression. He is thirty, with fair hair, cut brush-wise,
small uptwisted moustache, and a stolid pink and white countenance.

has been such a happy time. I wish it could go on for ever I

Miss W. There was a moon that evening when you asked me
—do you remember—on the balcony?
Von O. On the balgony, yes. And onderneat in the road a
pand blayed. I remember when you bromise to be my wife, I
was so mat with choy I gif the drombone half-a-grown 1
Mian W. It came as such an utter surprise to me". I could
hardly believe you meant it.
Von. 6. I did not. In the dark I dake it as a vlorin. But no
madder.
Miss W. I—I mean, I thought you would have cared for
somebody who was nearer your own age. It seems so wonderful
you should have chosen me, with so many pretty, attractive
girls at Marina House.
Von G. I do not gare for them. At the Marina House they
are too m'rdatious, and they are not real laties. Pesides; when
they are yong and bretty, they exbect too much addentiou. I
brefer somebody who is quiet, and mittle-aged, vedder she haf a
liddle money or not makes nodings. Since my onkel is det, I
haf blenty. But a real, highborn Englisch laty—that is the
brincipal thing.
Alias W. As to that, I can only tell you my dear father was a
sugar-broker.
Von d. A sugar-proker! (With slight uneasiness.) Dell me
—that Is not the same as a gonvectioner?
Miss W. Indeed, it isn't. It 'a not a trade at all. It 'a quite a
nice business to be in—almost a profession. They don't touch
the sugar themselves, only deal with it somehow—like stocks.
My brother is in it now—but he doesu't do very much, except
when his partner is away.
Von 6. (relieved). I am glatt it is no worse as that. In my
gountry of Schvitzerland they are demogradigal, but my family,
the Von GCBLRRS, com originally from Owstria, where they were
oal parons. And you onderstand, for my familie's sake I gould
not marry a wife whose gonnections were common beoples.
Miss W. I am glad to say that we have scarcely any connec-
tions—certainly none that you need be in the least ashamed of.
Von 6. I pelief it wefl. Sugar-proking is no doubt quide
chendeel, though I do not recollect to haf met any sugax-proker
at the daple of my friend Lord GOLBSHAFTS. You know him, yes?
Miss W. I caa't say I do. Is Lord COLBSHAFM a great mend
of yours?
Von G. At von dime, yes. We were gonstantly togetter. J

I lose side of him altpgetter. Is that not the way with your so
broud and shtiff English lorts?
Miss W. I know so little about them. We are very quiet
people, SPENCER and I.
Von G. So? And who is SBENCKR?
Miss W. SPBNCER is my brother. And oh, FRITZ, he doesnt
know anything about it yetl
Von G. (staring). Not know that he is your broder?
Miss W. No, no. Of our engagement. I really haven't had
courage to write. I'm afraid it will be a dreadful blow to him.
You see, he has lived with me in the same house all these years.
Von G. Oal the more reason he find a house for himself.
Miss W. But it's his house just as much aa mine. More, be-
cause he has always paid the rates and taxes.
Von G. Ach, the goot SBENCEH. Nefer shall he be durned
from our doors, mine HKNRIETTB. Alvays shall there be a goot
varm gorner for SBENCBR!
Miss W. Dear FRITZ, I knew you had a tender heart, though
you1 do try to hide it under Yes, SPENCER must live with us.
I know you will be fond of him. He is so kind, and simple, and
sincere—you can depend upon him so absolutely.
Von G. Apsoludely, no—because I haf myself a hddle. But
he may continue to bay the raaes and daxes.
Miss W. He would be simply miserable if he had to live all
by himself now. He 's some years older than I am.
Von G. So old as that? Quide too old to marry, then 1
Miss W. To marry? I can't imagine SPBNCBR ever doing
that—now. He 's a little difficult to please, and besides, he has
always said he was much too comfortable with me to run the nsk
of a change. I do hope he won't mind much. It will have to
be broken to him very gently.
Von G. I will do it very chendly. To-morrow I walk in witn
you. arm-in-arm—so: I dig him chogosely—but bolitely—in the
shtomag, and say, "Goot efening, broder-m-lawI Then he

AUGUSTE EN AJSfGLETERRE.
LONDON.
Dr.Aic MISTEB,—The Stockexchauge is one of the curiosities ol
the city, i am gone to see her there is some days. Naturally
1 attend to find a great edifice on a great place, as the Bourse at
.Paris. But, after much of difficulty and much of explications
li inn the ageuta of police—so enormous and so polite—1 arrive to
a. small street at side of the Bank of England, where one would
attend to find the entry of the personal—that which one calls the
"backdoor" in engiish—and, voild, in another little end of sack,
cul-de-sac, approached from this little street, finds herself the
.-iitry of the tfourse of London. \V hat droll of ideal Pas may
ttifique du tout, not magnificent of the all.
Kh well, 1 perceive several persons who enter, and therefore me
alao I enter, as to the Bourse at Pans. Truly I know not,
though it is in my country, if all the world can to enter the
liourse, hut 1 am entered two times or more, and I have erred
at the interior at the middle of the iouixiers, pursers, all crying
at high voice.
I do of same at London, and I enter with some misters who
arrive at the same instant. By consequence the guardian at the
entry perceives me not. I arrest myself at the glassed doors of the
interior, for to regard before of to enter. One has told me, since,
that the strangers are permitted of to do that, and therefore the
cuiicierye occupies not himself of it more.
The interior is enough vast and enough high. The walls are
covered of a substance who resembles to the cheese of Gorgon-
zola. It is perhaps a sort of marble. The floor is dirty, and
covered of pieces of paper, as at Paris, and of pursers, who push
some cries with much of noise, also as at Paris. During that 1
regard, a man in costume of concierge waiks himself among the
pursers carrying a waterer, arrusoir, and waters the dusty floor.
\\ hat droll of idea I It is evident that the Loudouian loves much
the mud, if he makes to make some mud even in the Stock-
exchange. Having seen all thia, 1 open the door, and I enter
tor to traverse to the other side.
At pain am I entered when all suddenly I have the hat
enfonce, smashed, on the head. Very astonished I search the
reason of this attack, and in this moment here a second blow
smashes him yet more. Then my hat falls to earth, I perceive
that I am surrounded of pursers, I hear some cries, some ex-
clamations, the crowd pushes, I am bouscule, I leave to fall my
umbrella, my pardessus is almost torn, and, before that I can to
say JOHN KOBINSON, I find myself in the court of entry. In
ettect I am "chucked outside." Ale, AUGUSTS, a peaceable
voyager from a friendly country! It is too much strong, c'est
trap foft! tiacre nom de nom! But I go to be calm.
"Misters," I say to those who have attacked me, '' I go im-
mediately to the trench Ambassade for to demand the interven-
tion of my government. It will be an international affair. At
present I say not anything, except that I demand my hat and mj
umbrella." After to hare obtained them, I throw myself in a
cab and I go direct to the Ambassade.
In arriving there I am received—in french we say " intervieicA"
—by a young attached man, an jeune attache, who is truly deso-
lated, and one can not more sympathetic, ana as amiable as pos-
sible. But he is also diplomatist, and, always with thousand
regrets and praying me to believe to his lively sympathy, he
says me that it is not—he assures me of it—an international
affair, that it is not even—lielas!—an affair of police, seen that
—well sure without any bad intention—I had wrong, because one
is defended of to enter. Also that the pursers are very little
occupied at present, that they amuse themselves to true to say
almost as some boys, and that it was but a pleasantery of their
part. "line fort mauvaise plaisanterie!" I cry, indicating my
hat and my umbrella. But by degrees I leave myself to persuade,
je me Im.. i persuader, and in fine I commence to laugh. And in
laughing one forgets naturaljy his bad humour. The young at-
tached mun smiles—a fine smile of diplomatist—I thank him, and
I say to him " Adieu."
In quitting the Ambassade I perceive that my umbrella is not
ruined, I buy a new hat, and even I find that my ancient hat—
which resembles at. present to an accordion, or to a "gibus"
a moitie ferine, at half closed—can to be "blocked" and repassed,
and will be then, in verity, enough good for a such climate.

SENSE FOR THE SEXES.
DEAR MB. PUNCH,—A talented lady has recently written a
charming book, called Manners for Men. I can praise it with
the greatest heartiness as I have not read it. But the title sug-
gests a companion volume, Styles for Women. Could not some-
one—more accomplished than I—take the matter up? To assist
;he author—it would scarcely be fair for the writer to be of the
:eminine gender—I jot down a few specimens of style.
Literary.—Hair cut short, pince-nez, tailor-cut coat, and
divided skirt.
Musical.—Dishevelled tressea, jewels, and fine raiment.
Theatrical.—Picture-hat, furs, thirty-button gloves, and brown
>aper covered MS.
Charitable.—Prim curls, ulster, umbrella, and carpet-bag full
of tracts.
Domestie.—Perfection personified.
There, Mr. Punch, is the germ of the idea. Let the coming
author teach our ladies the styles to adopt and to avoid. \\ hj
hould poor men have to listen to all the preaching?

"A WAY THEY WILL HAVE IN THE NAVY.'
(Jttporl sligtuly in advance.)
TUB Commissioners of the Admiralty
were making their annual inspection. The
weather was fine, so their yachting expe-
dition had been exceptionally pleasant.
They had seen the ships and the guns. At
that point they had stopped short.
"And now you say that the whole of the
machinery is worked from the central
tower?" queried the First Lord.
"Yes," was the reply. "The vessel
steered, the guiis are worked, and the fires
aro stuki-d, all by electricity."
"Au ingenious contrivance," remarked
the Second Sea Lord.
"Very," consented the Superintendent.
"And, as recruits are scarce, convenient."
"Well, with the inspection of this last
first-rate battleship our inspection con-
cludes. I think we have seen every-
thing?"
The colleagues of the speaker whispered
a suggestion.
"To be sure—I had forgotten it. We
have seen the ships and the guns. But we
have not inspected the men. So perhaps
we might overhaul the crew of the present
vessel. Mr. Admiral, will you kindly beat
to quarters?"
Thus invited, the officer wh'istled, and
the summons was answered by a head ap-
pearing out of the central tower.
"And who may you be?" asked the
First Lord.
"Please your honour," came the reply,
"I am the crew."
"The crew! What crew?"
"The crew of this here vessel; and I can
tell you, lords and gentlemen, that it's
precious lonely working a big ship like tin-
without a messmate!
And the Lords of the Admiralty—having
nothing better to do—made a note of the
objection.

THE QUEEN'S COMMEMORATION.
(A few Humours.)
IT is stated that the Royal procession will be a mile long.
There is reason to believe that Her Majesty will drive round
Greater London, through Brentford, Finchley, West Ham aud
Croydon.
It is said that all the provincial mayors and aldermen will go
on foot with the procession round Greater London. Their wives
and daughters will follow in provincial flies.
We hear that the procession will be five miles long.
It is reported that the procession will include all men who
have served in the volunteers, each one armed with an um-
brella.
Rumour says that the procession will be fifteen miles long.
It is stated that all persons now. or formerly, in official posi-
tions throughout the United Kingdom will join the procession.
We believe that the last of the Royal carnages will be followed
by all the school children of the metropolis, two and two.
It is understood that the procession will be forty miles Ic ng.
It is rumoured that all the ratepayers of London will be in-
cluded in the procession, each one bearing the hist printed receipt
pinned on the left breast.
It is said that the procession will include the Sette of Odd
Volumes, the London County Council, the Art Workers Guild,
the Corporation of London, the Jacobite League, the Royal
Academy of Arts, the Society of Architects, the Church and
Stage Guild, the Two Pius Club, the Primrose League, and other
Metropolitan Societies.
There is reason to believe that the procession will stretch in an
unbroken line round Greater London from one gate of Bucking-
ham Palace to the other.
It is thought that, this being the case, Her Majesty, to avoid
needless fatigue, will leave thr> 1'alaiv by one gate at the end of
the procession, and will immediately re-enter by the other gate
at the head of it.
As we go to press we understand that all statements as to the
route or arrangement of the Royal procession are entirely un-
authorised and premature.

ON THE USES OF PARODY.
IT was a man of modest wits
Who dealt in vacant chaff;
He did a little book of skits
To make the people laugh.
A fleeting vogue such things will win,
And he was asked to dine,
To meet a many people in
The literary line.
Pride battled in his breast with fear;
He knew his low degree;
He doubted if he dare appear
In such society.
For here would muster men of fame,
Impaled upon his pen;
If they should recognise his name,
What might not happen then?
Stars of the upper firmament,
Lights of a lurid age,
Their dignity might well resent
A puppy's persiflage.
Nevertheless the following thought
Set silly fears aside :—
"I am too much a thing of naught
To be identified."
He went. The air was thick with brains,
The language loud and tall;
Some wore their locks like lions' manes,
And some had none at all.
Who should his neighbours be? He
scanned,
Trembling, the dinner-list;
A decadent (consumptive) and
A blatant atheist I
Both victims I Wedged between the bards,
He spilled, with furtive shame,
A large hors d'cevvre across the card's
White face that bore his name.
Too late I They saw it I Through the wall
He sent a steady gaze;
When on his ears began to fall
Polite and lavish praise.
"But quite, quite excellent!" they said,
"A rare and generous jest!
Though other people's taste is dead,
You recognise the best.
"You have, we know, a heart that feels
Beneath your cynic smile;
None but a poet's touch reveals
A brother-poet's style."
Much gratified, he drank their toast,
And subsequently laid
The naked facts before his boat,
Who understood the trade.
"The publishers," said he, "regard
Your work as mainly sent
To serve the heavy-hanging bard
For cheap advertisement.
"So far from feeling inward pain,
He shews a sense of wit;
He hopes your humour may attain
To make a thumping hit.

He sells by twos and fours;
The public has to buv his rhymes
To see the point of yours."

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIAKY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, Feb. 22.—
Blood is thicker than whiskey — even
Scotch. BOB REID, though, his people come
from Dumfriesshire, and he for more than
ten years has represented the chief town ol
the county, never forgets he was born in tht
Isles of Greece. From circumstances over
which he had no control the hallowed place
was Corfu. It might have been Crete,
and at this moment, instead of being a
leader at the Bar, an honoured Member of
the Commons, speaking with the authority
of an ex-Attorney-General, BOB might have
been a shock-haired insurgent, with a
waistband full of pistols, a short skirt over
a portly paunch, and strips of dubious
coloured calico twined round his leg below
the knee, picturesquely and economically
designed to serve the double purpose of
stockings, and preclude the costly exten-
sion of trousers.
It has been ordained otherwise, and to-
night BOB found opportunity of delivering
a speech on behalf of his cousin-islanders
that deeply stirred the House. A fine,
frank, warm-hearted appeal, bubbling over
with honest indignation at Turkish iniquity
and diplomatic deliberation; worth a
score of more elaborate indictments.
Brisk debate throughout, happily shew-
ing how House of Commons of to-day
is as ready to sympathise with struggling
Nationalities as it was in CANNING'S time.
Sorry for PRINCE AIM urn and his col-
leagues on Treasury Bench. SARK, from
whom no secrets are hid, tells me that
when full disclosure of particulars is
made it will appear that throughout long
negotiations England, as represented by
the MAHKIHS, will be found to have been
ever on the side of Freedom against the
Tyranny of the Turk. Short of running
amuck at the Great Powers, and plunging
the continent into war, the MAKKISS has
toiled incessantly^ for the deliverance of
Crete. Diplomatic usages prevent disclo-
sure being made at present moment. So
Ministers, tongue-tied, have to bear the
odium of suspicion of helping the Sultan
to hold Crete down, with lean hands
clasped round its throat.
Once PRINCE ARTHUR, stung to the.
quick, leaped to his feet; seemed as if

A PAIR OF KIDS AND A HERO.
ON Tuesday, March 16th, the play of Tlte Two Little Vaga-
bonds will attain its 200th performance, and Mr. ALBERT AUGUS-
TUS GILMER, of the Princess's Theatre, is to be heartily con-
gratulated on having got together a company that plays so
admirably this strong melodrama of the genuine old Porte St.
Martin-Surrey-cum-Adelphi type, in five acts and eight scenes,
lastiii)' from eight till fleven with the ex-itemerit kept uo
until the fall of the curtain. Misj SYDNEY FAIRBROIIIER, cer-
tainly a name of good omen in this instance, gives a most artisti-
cally pathetic rendering of Wafly, the "weaker brother" vaga-
bond; and Miss KATE TYNDALL plays Dick, the hale and hearty
boy, in a thoroughly bqvish style: and this is the greatest praise
possible. The three villainous loafers, represented by Messrs.
GURNEY, WALKER, and COLEMAN, are repulsively clever; their
"make-up" is most artistic, and their acting most natural.
Probably it will run on for another hundred nights.
At the Avenue Theatre, Nelson's Enchantress, by RISDEN HOME
(a name associated in the song with "England, Home, and
Beauty, representing, evidently, NELSON, the dramatist, and
Lady HAMILTON), affords Mr. FORBES ROBERTSON an opportunity
of showing how closely he can make up to resemble NELSON,
and how touchingly he can represent the last dying moments
of England's naval hero. Beyond this the materials at hand
have been thrown away. The dramatist should have dealt
with NELSON as the author of Madame, fit. Gene has done with
NAPOLEON ;and surely the career of Lady HAMILTON offers as many
dramatic opportunities as does that of the French washerwoman.
As it is, NELSON'S enchantress hasn't a chance; and if Mrs.
PATRICK CAMPBELL ever thought she had it in this piece, it is
she, and not the author, who is to blame. Critics and public
unite in, blaming authors when there is a failure, and never lay the
blame on the shoulders of managers or actors. The dramntist
is invariably "the whipping boy." The attraction for the nubile
at the Avenue is to see how Mr. FORBES ROBERTSON and Mrs.
PATRICK CAMPBKI.I, look as .Vrfonn and Laily Hamilton.
NATURAL HISTORY.—The bear at the Westminster Aquarium
must have bren worth a "monkey," seeing that the jury in the
recent case awarded 500?. damages.
WHERE ARE THE MOTORS OF YESTERYEAR?
(Some Theories as to their ilisappearaiice.)
THAT like Ilans lireitmann's "barty," they have taken the
automatic bit between their teeth and moted away into the
ewigkeit.
That they have been bought up by the Amalgamated Cab-
Drivers' Union, or whatever it is, to serve as playthings during
the enforced leisure of strike periods.
That, after their pretty universal break-down on the opening
day last November, they are being generally overhauled, cleaned
up. deodorised, and having the rattle taken out of them.
That they will only appear once a year, at the Lord Mayor's
Show, to increase the hifarity of the London crowd.
That they are being carefully preserved in sawdust or cotton-
wool, in order that they may be produced as objects of historic
interest, or monuments of inventors' incapacity, at the centenary
of the much-boomed "Emancipation Day" in 1996.
That they have all started off for the North Pole, as their
drivers affect nautical costume.
That they are lying low, till the County Council provides us
with a decently straight and broad street in London, and one
where the pavement is left undisturbed for two consecutive days.
That they are being converted into steam-rollers, or flying-
machines.
That they have been acquired by the War-Office, in order to
strike terror in the hearts of possible invaders, or to transport
our microscopic army from the base to the front in time of
hostilities. The Cavalry will then become the Mounted Auto-
motry, after the fashion of the early British war-chariots, tho
horses, if any survive, being put inside.
That they are being used as bath-chairs in Little Pedlington
super-Mare or some other quiet seaside resort.
That they are being fitted with poles and shafts, so that norsef
or donkeys may bo harnessed to them.
That we shall see them all on Hampstead Heath on Easter
Monday, most probably as bout-swings or steam-roundabouts.
That they have privately exploded and are in smithcieens, or,
Lastly, that they have been broken up by their owners and sold
as old iron.

DEAR MK. PUNCH,—Seeing that various
Victorian Exhibitions have been arranged
at the Crystal Palace, Earl's Court, and
elsewhere, where memorials of HER MA-
JESTY'S glorious reign are to be on view,
I venture to ask wtiether you think there
would be any possibility of disposing of

lutely true specimens, and I will also vouch
that, extending as they do over at least a
quarter of a century, they have cost me
a very large sum of money to bring to-
gether. They would form a splendid
monument to the integrity and courage of
the legal profession in all its branches, as
well as to inexhaustible gold-mining re-

long before this, MARIA.
Maria. I Ve never known him so late, Miss—and the night
you Ve come home and all! But it's my belief he 's been kep at
the office by business, or somethink o' that. He hasn't seemed
himself this last day or two.
Miss Woth. (to herself). He can't have heard already I
(Aloud.) What makes you think that, MARIA?
Maria. He's been so restless and excited like, and then he
won't take proper care of himself—sends his dinner down hardly
touched, till Cook, she's almost broken-'arted about it. And
what's the good of my putting out his thick flannel vesta now the
mornings are turning chilly, if he won't put 'em on? I'm sure
I 'm thankful to have you back, Miss, for he 's not fit to be left
alone, and I 've got no authority over him!
Miss Woth. (to herself). How selfish I've been! (To MARIA.)
There's your Master at last. I hear his key. Run down,
MARIA, and make him change his shoes, and tell him I 'ni up here.

coward I am, afraid to meet my dear, good brother SPENCER, who
never in all his life!

have you back again. Uncommonly lonely here all by myself.

I 'm afraid I am, rather. The fact is, I—I had to go down to
Shepherd's Bush to—to see a friend. (Abruptly.) You Ve
scarcely told me anything about Scarborough. Any pleasant
people at the boarding-house?
Henr. (to Iterself). He hasn't heard. If I could only

people. But about yourself, SPEN, haven't you found it dread-

to Did you have a comfortable journey home?
Henr. Yes, I—I was very well looked after. SPENCER, have
you walked up to town through the Gardens, as you promised,
every morning? .

ful I found it. Wonderful how the trees have kept their foliage.
Then the air's been so mild. Why, one could sit about in the
shade as if!
Henr. Was that quite prudent of you, SPENCER—if what I've
heard is true?
Spen. (alarmed). Prudent. Why, what have you heard, ETTA,
whut have you heard?
Henr. You ought to remember, SPEN, that it's not as if you
were a young man, and any sudden change
Spen. Ah, my dear, you may well call it sudden. I'm sure
that if anyone had told me a week ago that one of us would—
would ever contemplate matrimony, I should have laughed in his
face. I don't laugh; now, ETTA, my dear, I don't laugh now.

he liked.

'Twas not the look you 're wont to wear!
I noticed that your laugh was hard.

And surely you belied the bard,—
Who wrote the ballads that you sang?
I 'm sure he never meant that air

No. IX.—OF BUMPS AND BUMP-SUPPERS—OK A VISIT TO TOWN—
OF LieiuhE-RuoMs—OF A COUSIN'S ENGAGEMENT.
DEAR UNCLE BOB,—Of course you 've seen in the papers that
we made our four bumps alright, we caught St. Luke's in forty
strokes but they wouldn't acknowledge it so we had to row on
till we ran right over their riggers and nearly swamped them, it
we had had another night for racing we should have gone head
tor a moral as St. Michael's were only half a length away from
bt. Luke s when we caught them, still we shall get our oars given
us for making a bump every night which is something. I didn't
get cooked any night except Thursday when we had an awfully
tough job of it and didn't catch them till after the Railway
Bridge and there was a wind against us in the Long Reach but 1
made up my mind I 'd stick to it till I was blind and at last we
did it with a rattling spurt. I could always tell when we were on the
top of another boat because little PICKFORD our cox got quite
purple in the face and foamed at the mouth and screamed all
sorts of rot, I thought he 'd go mad and he 's as proud as a pea-
cock became he thinks it was all his doing and we all tell him
he 's a cert for coxing the Varsity next year. The Mater and
ALICE and Aunt MARGARET came up on the Friday and saw us
make our bump at Ditton and I think the Mater was pleased be-
cause she waved at me like anything, but she cried a little after-
wards she sometimes does. It [Was very jolly going out of train-
ing and we had a grand bump-supper with any amount of Jobster
mayonaze and lots of tarts and ice puddings, we had plenty of
champagne too and we were all very happy but nobody got buffy
only excited. BLADES and WILSON who are rowing in the Varsity
came in afterwards and sat with us for about twenty minutes and
BLADES made a ripping speech the best I ever heard, he said he
didn t want better chaps than us to row behind him next May
races and we had upheld the traditions of the old Boat Club, he 's
a splendid man and we 're all ready to do anything in the world
for him. My eye I do hope I shall row in our May boat You
were quite right, uncle BOB, rowing is simply grand and I'm
awfully glad 1 took it up. Besides you get to be good friends
with such a lot of real good fellows. Tatters is quite well he
enjoyed the races immensely and rau along with us every night
yelling and barking, he was delighted with the rattles and seized
one put of a man's hand and ran off with it I never saw a dog
so pleased, he had a fight this morning with another fox-terrier
and got the best of it.
Look here uncle BOB could you put me up over Sunday if I
could get leave to come to town next Saturday. We might do a
theatre together. I think they 'd give me leave if you wouldn't
mind writing a letter as they 're quite pleased with the way I 've
been working this term. I should like to see you again very
mucn- Your affectionate nephew JACK.
(Answer to the preceding.)
MY DEAR JACK,—I am naturally much touched by your as-
surance that you would like to see me again. In these callous
and calculating days it is something to know that one can always
rely on the genuine affection of a nephew—and such a nephew.
Uj/ow shall I worthily entertain the laurelled hero of four trium-
phant bumps? Will he who has tasted the blazing joys of these
victories, who has revelled in the fierce but (as 1 see by your
letter) umntoxicating delights of an ice-pudding and champagne
bump-supper, and has, glory of glories, been patted on the back
by a rowing Blue—will such a one, I ask myself, content rhiuiself
with the humble fare provided by the chef at BBOOKS'S, even
tnougn it be followed by an excursion to the Gaiety Theatre
where they tell me, the sacred lamp of burlesque still burns as
brightly as ever? Yes, perhaps he will. And in any case, my
dear JACK, 1 shall be proud to put you up on Saturday and to do
what I can for your amusement. You have been working well
and even Apollo—but you know how that god deals with his
bow. So I enclose a letter for you to show to your tutor so that
his stony heart may be moved to grant you leave over next
Sunday, I undertaking, as you will notice, to look after your
weltare, and to send you back unharmed to the lap of your
Alma Mater on Monday morning.
You have my heartiest congratulations on your four bumps.
They are a grand send-off for you on your rowing career. You
need not imagine that because we are old fellows we have ceased
to care for such things. Why, these are the very things that we
delight in, and by such victories you youngsters warm our hearts.
\\ e too have been in Arcadia, and as we send our minds back
over the years our pulses stir again with the splendour of those
past aquatic tussles when we swung and spurted and panted and
shut our teeth and spurted again while the yells and the tumult
of the crowd raced with us along the bank. These happy days,
the grip of our friends' hands, their cheers, and our own un-
alloyed delight are what we most remember when lecture-rooms
and examinations and • I shall not finish this sentence, for
after all I reverence lecture-rooms, and I abide by examinations.
They are to me a part of the great British constitution—two
words, by the way, which I have heard men articulate with diffi-
culty after a bump-supper. No more of this.
You will have heard the news of the engagement of your
cousin ADELAIDE to Captain BRUNTON, but you may not know the
details of the interesting event. They were staving at Short-
lands, and there the Hussar proposed. She asked for time, she
wished to consider, the surprise was so great. Thereupon the
Captain became gloomy, and went out with a double-barrelled
gun. ADELAIDE became alarmed. Horror of horrors! Did her
lover meditate suicide? She rushed after him. Soon she heard
two shots in rapid succession, \\li.it terrible determination!

I HAD a little sweetheart and her name was "Simple JANE,"
Heigho! her conduct was immoral!
She laughed at my solicitude and revelled in my pain.
Well! well! we both agreed to quarrel!
Then next I met a damsel, who was known as "Jolly JENNY,"
Ha! ha! she made the pieces jingle I
She always spent a sovereign when I possessed a penny,
So! so 1 I said I would be single!
And then I loved another maid, they called her" Gentle JANET,"
Ah! mo! her temper was her mother's!
But now she 's left this wicked world to join a blessed planet,

"THE Temple Classics " are gems of print and binding. Add to
this, they are both companionable and pocketable,—honestly so,
of course. J. M. DENT & Co. of Aldine House have just
brought out Le Mvrte JJarthur in this dainty series.
All lovers of romance will thank me for strongly recommend-
ing to their immediate attention the simple yet powerfully dra-
matic story by MAX PEMBKRTON, entitled, Christine, of the Hills.
There is not in it one line of description too much, nor is
there any pause in the action. The characters are clearly and
forcibly drawn, and the only puzzle for the reader is. how camo
the ancient mariner, the Old Sinner of Sebenico, who nar-
rates the tale, to have obtained such an intimate knowledge of
all the details he so graphically describes ?" There are few that
have my tongue, Excellency," quoth the wily old rascal, who was
going to be treated to a good dinner before entertaining his
entertainer.
A delightful edition of dear old I/A VK WALTON'S Compleat
Angler, edited by RICHARD LE GALLIENNE, and charmingly illus-
trated by EDMUND H. NEW, has been brought out by enterprising
JOHN LANE, of The Bodley Head. The Gallienic remarks are
original, and the illustrations all New. Delightful are the quaint
pictorial reminders of Waltham and its Abbey, of Theobalds, and
the house built long ago on the site of Theobald's Palace, called
"Thibbald's Place, which, without any breach of confidence,
it may be now and here mentioned, was the scene of many of
the events recorded in a certain small work entitled Happy
Thoughts. "Well does the Happy-Thought writer remember,"
says the Baron, "the house and the garden, so faithfully repre-
sented in this present edition of The Compleat Angler at p. Ill,
where many of the happiest of Happy Thought hours were spent.
Most dear, also, to the same poor scribbler's memory is the shady
lane (p. 94) that led up to that quaint old house." By no one
will *his book be more enjoyed than by the writer of this brief
notice.
NANSEN, the explorer, has been taken up by a Constable, that
is, by CONSTABLE it Co. of Westminster, which firm has pub-
lished, in two big volumes, well illustrated, the story of the
Norwegian Polar Expedition undertaken by Dr. FHIDTJOF NANSE.N.
'Twas o'er the northern i, c,
Brave boj B,
We made for NAMUN'H goal;
Hut we had to tack,
And to home come ba<>k,
As we did not find that Pole,
Brave boys,
We could not climb that 1'ole!
There they were, all ready, aye ready, with their books and
diaries, to act on Cap'en Cuttle's advice, and the Pole, "when
found," they would have '' made a note of."
\Miat pluck! what endurance! "Strange things came up to
look at them!" and "proud" as the ancient admiral were they
all "of such a bonuie bark" as was The Fram.
During the three years they were away walruses and bears
became as "a drug in the market "; while monsters were mono-
tonous. They did not encounter a Caliban, and fortunately
were not encumbered by the presence of a Trincula and Stephana.
The historic meeting between STANLEY and Dr. LIVINGSTONE
finds its parallel in that of NANSEN and JACKSON.
Two solitaries meet on an ice plain.
"Aren't you NANSEN P" asks JACKSON, quite casually, as if he
had come across him accidentally in a club smoking-room.
"Yes, I am." confesses the Arctic explorer, scorning all un-
worthy subterfuge.
"By Jove!" exclaims JACKSON, "I am glad to see you."
It is " simple comme ban jowr!" So commonplace as to remind
us of Farmer GEORGE saying to the louts at Gloucester New
Bridge, "Why, then let us have a huzzav!" And the whole
narrative is so plainly told. Cheerfulness, hopefulness, and mar-
vellous endurance, these ore the notes of an explorer's charac-
ter; and these qualities were shared by Dr. NANSEN and his
gallant companions. THE BARON.

"PRESENT—HUMPS!"
(Address to Mr. Punch by a Constant Admirer.)
WHEN Fortune frowns, and things go
wrong,
And life seems on the "slump,"
To meet a hunchback 's more than gold,
A certain road to luck, I'm told,
To touch his hump.
And e'en if Fortune to one's pile
Keeps adding lump on lump,
Lest she should change, one ought to try,
Should one a passing hunchback spy,
To touch his hump.
Mere superstition? No one need
To that conclusion jump.
Tn truth a hunchback, as I state,
Brings luck to all, both small and great.
Who touch his hump.
Prince of all hunchbacks, Mr. Punch,
Each trick in life I 'd trump,
What cards soever might be in.
If only once my hand might win
To touch your hump!
SUMMARY OF NEWS FOR MARCH.
(Foreign Politics barred.)
THE weather has been changeable. Rain
and gale much in evidence. Sunshine in-
termittent, and resembling moonshine.
The intelligence at Scotland Yard of the
customary character. The police are under-
stood to be following a clue.
Fashions much the same as ever. Epau-
lettes on ladies' dresses, and floral adapta-
tions of the Tour Eiffr.l worn on the left ol
low-crowned, narrow-brimmed straw hats.
Dinners in aid of several charities arc
being held. At more th?n one of them,
somebody is mildly amusing about the pre-
sent condition of the British drama.
Novels are still produced at the rate of
about one in five minutes. Of these, five
per cent, are needed, and about three pel
cent. pay.
There have been several accidents at
football, and the language on the golf links
at Wimbledon and elsewhere is choice and
distinctly vigorous.
Letters about the early arrival of the
cuckoo and the premature budding of ever-
greens find their way to the waste-paper
basket, in the editorial sanctum.
And lastly—freshest item of news of all
—Her Britannic Majesty Queen ANNE is
said to be dead.
In the Waterloo Road.
The Ufa. Johnson Griggs (who has just
arrived from Somersetshire, to sportsman,
hurrying to catch, the train for K?mptott
Park). Could you kindly point out the
way to Lambeth Palace?

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM TUB DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, March 1.
—Consecrated rule of debate in House ot
Commons that if there appears on the
Orders notice to move resolution on a par-
ticular subject no Member may rush in and
preoccupy the ground. This makes ob-
vious opening for little bit of tactics. In
ordinary way, private Members who can
muster forty adherents may force the hand
of the strongest Government, compelling
debate on any subject by moving adjourn-
ment of House in order to discuss it as a
matter of urgent public importance. But,
you see, if such action is apprehended it
suffices for friend of Government to give
notice of a resolution on the particular
topic, which is straightway barred.
HOWARD VINCENT, the Friend of Man
(including the Ministry), much annoyed by
importunate Radicals raising embarrassing
debates about Crete. Why can't they
leave it in hands of best of all Ministries?
Happy thought. Place amendment on
paper promising to call attention to state
of Crete and move resolution. "That'll
spoil their little game," HOWARD VINCENT
said to Member for Sark. "But a tricky lot,
those Radicals; must be wary in dealing
with them. If I confine my notice of mo-
tion to Crete they'll break out in Mace-
donia, or return to Armenia, or cut in at
Constantinople. Will try and get round
me somehow. I'll be even with them.
Tell you what, I '11 get a resolution made
in Germany, warranted to beat them off at
any point."
Experiment seemed to answer to a tin-
tack. Never was seen such a notice ot
motion (at the price). Didn't seem to
leave an opening through which a Radical
might even peep at a perturbed Minis-
try. Having carefully erased the mark of
origin, H. V. placed resolution on the
paper and felt that all was well. Had not
forgotten any possible avenue of attack,
not even the Balearic Islands or the vexed
Bermoothes.
"If any Radical can crawl through that
stockade," he whispered to KENYON-SLA-
NKY, "I forgive him. Wonderful fellows
those Germans. When they undertake to
make anything, from a hair-brush to a
House of Commons resolution, they do it
thoroughly."
"Right you are," whispered back
KRNYON-SLANEY, and the windows in the
adjoining church of St. Margaret rattled
responsive.
To-day SQUIRE OF MALWOOD comes
down prepared to move adjournment
in order to discuss as matter of urgent
public importance situation in Crete.
Has given PRINCE ARTHUR notice of his
intention. Gage of battle accepted;
speeches prepared; House crowded. And

A GHO(H)STLY VISITANT!
(During the Diieunioiton the Voluntary Schools Sill.)
Did Our Artist's eyes deceive him, or dad Sir John's astral body really emerge in the twilight
and give form to his hidden feelings?
where 's HOWARD VINCENT'S resolution,
iron-bound, copper-bottomed, made in Ger-
many, warranted for three years, unsink-
able, fire-proof, bomb-proof, water-proof?
\Sh.v, the SPEAKER has ruled that there is
nothing in it. Of no account whatever a.s
bearing on motion for adjournment! Worse
than all, a simple notice of three lines, made
in London by JOHN DILLON, effectually
does what H. V. elaborately strove after.
It blocks the way for to-night, and being
withdrawn the wicked Radicals will to-
morrow have their way. Ignoring exist-
ence of HOWARD VINCENT'S masterpiece
they will discuss Crete at length.
Which only shows how uncertain is life,
and how unaccountable its ways in the
House of Commons.
Business done.—Got into Committee on
the Education Bill.
Tuesday.—This one of the occasions
when the Houoie, to which as a rule no-
body is indispensable, misses Mr. GLAD-
STONE. Debate admirable, GEORGE CURZON
in particular rising to fullest height of
Parliamentary style yet reached by him,
and the level has always been high. But
only the unsurpassable, unapproachable fire
of Mr. G. could fuse into magnificently
molten mass the questions of Crete strug-
gling to be free, ol Greece stretching out a
hand to help, of the banded Powers with
irresistible force thrusting it back.
In the Father's absence the House wel-
comed with peculiar pleasure the interpo-
sition of the Sou. HKRBKRT has earned the
rare and enviable position that the House
would willingly hear him speak oftener
than he. rises to address it. His early
Parliamentary career was naturally, per-
haps gratefully, overshadowed by that
grtat mountain DON JOSE once adored.
\\hen the mountain disappeared, and there
was chance for little hills to skip and hop,
HERBERT, resisting the temptation, set
himself diligently to the work of First
Commissioner, laying the foundation of en-
during monument by carrying scheme for
the opening up of Westminster Abbey and
the Houses of Parliament by a broader
vista from Parliament Street. Out of office
he has relapsed into access of modest mien
that covers sterling capacity. House quite
surprised to find him at Table to-night
championing the cause of Crete, hymning
in glowing language the griefs of
The IslcB of Greece, the Isles of Greece,
Where burning Sappho loved and sung,
Where grew the arts of War and IVare,
Where Dulos rope, whence Boh KP.HI sprung.
Business done.—Debate on Crete.

"Championing the Cinife of Crete."
Mr. H-rb-rt Gl-iUt-m-.
Thursday.—Another night in Committee
on Education Bill. Not exactly exhila-
rating; lacks the charm of the unexpected.
Only thing uncertain is at what particular
moment PRINCE ARTHUR will pounce. Re-
membering the burning indignation with
which Conservatives in Session of 1893 re-
sented occasional application of closure, 'tis
pretty to hear them hilariously cheer
when to-day PRINCE ARTHUR drops down
on critic of Education Bill with remark,
"I beg to move that the question be now-
put."
"Odd," says SARK, "how circumstances
alter cases. When the Conservatives are
in Opposition, they call the closure 'the
gag'; when they come into office, and find
occasion to use it, they allude to it by its
official name; whilst the Liberals, with
equal heat and righteous indignation, in
their turn talk about ' the gag.' When the
Liberals come into power, things in this
respect will be exactly reversed. Natural
enough; what is marvellous is the un-
feigned sincerity of conviction which at-
tends achievement of crossing floor of the
House. To-day, when PRINCE ARTHUR
pounces, SQUIRE OF MALWOOD and JOHN
MORLEY flush with honest, pained indig-
nation, just as in 1893 PRINCE ARTHUR
and DON JOSE blushed for their country
when closure was moved in Committee on
Home Rule Bill, Gentlemen of England
massed behind them wringing their hands,
lifting up their voice in long lamentation,
'Gag! gag!! gag!! I' We 're a rum lot,
when we come to think of it."
Business done. —Committee on Educa-
tion Bill.
Friday. — The vision of JOHNSTON of
Ballykilbeg is not, bounded by the coast of
Ireland. If a Conservative Flute Band,
assured in the remoteness of Bellshill,
think they can with impunity parade ite
streets, playing "Protestant Boys," "Boynr
Water," and "Kirk the Pope," they have
already discovered their error. It appears
that the religious exercise was followed by
a free fight, just as if Bellshill was the
floor of the House of Commons. A Roman
Catholic, the LORD ADVOCATE narrated, as-
saulted two of the bandsmen, and was ar-
rested, "the band afterwards retiring to a
public-ho'ise." Magistrates impartially
convicted and imprisoned Protestants and
Catholics.
BAT.LYKILBEG wants to know whether
playing Protestant tunes in the streets is
contrary to the laws of Scotland? If so, is
the LORD ADVOCATE prepared to assent to
an alteration in the law.
LORD ADVOCATE is not. BALLYKII.BEO
resumes his seat apparently discomfited,
but actually successful in flashing on the
walls of the House of Commons an inte-
resting picture of the amenities of life in
hitherto unrenowned Bellshill.

it General-Admiral?—Sir CHARLES DILKE,

condition of the Navy. A fortnight ago

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A BOOM IN NELSON PLAYS SEEMS IMMINENT, so PLAYGOERS MUST BE PREPARED FOR DIFFERENT IDEAS OF THE HERO OF TRAFALGAR.
FROM NORTH TO SOUTH.
(By a Ncmscnsical Explorer.)
"THE awakening spirit of man reared its head high, and peered
over that mysterious region that lies between Lincoln's Inn on
the north, and the great and roaring Strand on the south. The
mighty giant! The far-reaching limbs of the Law! In fact, the
dismal district of the Law Courts. To make that passage from
the north to the south has often been attempted. It can, and
shall be done! And I will do it."
It was thus I mused as early in the month of April, in fact,
upon the first day of that month, I set about the quest for which
for long weeks I had been preparing. As I leave my four-wheeler
to take the plunge, how my mind goes back to scenes I have left.
It is the first of April. A sunny-Faced lad calls out, "Grandad,
the pigs are in the back garden!" An old man's trembling step.
They are not there. "Yer April fool 1" An angry word; and
then, as the spring-day sun goes down, the sound of a stick
falling with measured beat; and the voice of a child as if in pain.
I wonder if they are thinking of me at home?
I am well prepared for what is before me. I have not
washed for a month. I have a pair of bands to fasten round
my neck, and proclaim myself a practising barrister, should
my way be barred. Some foolscap paper, neatly folded and
tied round with bright red tape, to be flaunted if opposition
be met with. Some counterfeit coins, to be passed if occa-
sion should demand. As for food, I have no fear. The chart
which is before me marks in red letters, "Refreshment Bar," at
every end and turn. The brightened faces of those who pass out
in hurrying streams, assure me that the supplies still hold out.
So far then all is well. But the future! What lies there are
before me—I mean, what lies before me?
As I arrive at the inner door I find it cunningly contrived, so
that he who comes out can thrust it straight on the nose of him
who comes in, who in turn can re-thrust it with the same effect.
So here, on the very threshold of this interesting region, I find
something to engage my attention. A strong current sets here
direct for Appeal Court No. 1. I cannot go into court. I have
not got clean hands. The course due south has to be pursued.
One is presently lost in a multitude of eddies. The sun is no
longer with me. The corridors that lie before me are wrapped
in gloom. My heart sinks. But why? Did I not know all
this before I started? Then why did I start? I several times
ask myself this question. I must have done this aloud, as I hear
in the semi-darkness the voice of one saying, "He's tight."
Still onward! I must be near the Courts of Chancery. There
is a drowsy lull in the air. I see the old church at home. The
collection bag comes round. What shall I get this time, I
wonder? Are they thinking of me at home?
It must be after lunch. The stream is setting strongly in two
directions. My chart shows me that to the right I shall find
myself in the perils of the Probate and Divorce Division; while
that to the left will gradually carry me to the straits of Sir
HENRY HAWKINS. I choose the latter. I am getting nearer.
The atmosphere grows warmer. I hear sounds as it were of
merriment, rippling laughter. I think of home and the panto-
mime. I seem to hear the familiar cry of "Here we are again!"
I have passed the straits. The tide rolls down a twisted stair.
VOL. ran,
The doors again remind me of those I felt now so long ago. I
am asked wnat my business is. I make a quick reply. My
collar is seized. I try to find my bands. Too late 1 I have got
the chuck! I am in the Strand. I have done the trick. The
deep peace of the spring evening sank beneficently over the
wearied spirit.
THE SONG OF HTBRIAS THE NORMAN.
(After the Greek—and copy.)
[See the Athena correspondence in a daily contemporary.]
MY wealth's a style of purple brand,
And some right good cheek, a hide untanned,
And sleeve wherein I chuckle;
With these I wire, I scribe, I show
Six Governments the way to go,
While crowned heads round me truckle.
Oh—oh—oh—oh!
I '11 make the Concert, hapless drones,
Bid Crete in diapason tones
To call me King and Lord—
"H. N." 's her rightful Lord!
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Mr. Punch in his early youth-time—Mr. P.'s life is all youth-
time, but the almanack requires comparison of dates—annually
gave the world a pocket-book, stray copies of which are now
among its most valued treasures. Probably incited by the great
Exemplar, Mr. BURDETT has his pocket-book. Official Intelli-
gence he calls the leaflet, which is published in four-horse vans
from the warehouse of SPOTTISWOODE & Co. It is now in its
sixteenth year, and in matters of size and fulness beats the most
bouncing boy of the close of the so-called Nineteenth Century.
It is, in sober truth, a marvel of compilation, a monument of
industry. What it does not tell in regard of British, American,
and Foreign Securities is not worth knowing. An ever-increas-
ing difficulty is its size and weight. With office-rent so high
in the City, merchants, companies, and banks, to all of whom
Burdett's Official Intelligence is indispensable, will soon have to
consider the necessity of building a special annexe, fitted with
hydraulic reading-stand, in which to store the Brobdingnagian
volume.
More power to your elbow and your hand, with a pen in it, Mr.
ANTHONY HOPE, and may you give us many and many another
such a stirring romance as is your latest Phroso to take us out of
ourselves, our cares, and our troubles, and into the land of pure
romance! HOPE tells a fluttering tale of love, murder, noble
heroism, villainous treachery, inducing the reader to watch a sort
of point to point race among the characters until all ends happily,
and hero and heroine reach their haven of well-earned rest.
"Etvoir! Espoir! C'ext la premU're fe.uille," and "la dernikre
feuUle" is as good as the first. All action, no time wasted on
useless descriptions; good stirring melodrama told in modern
conversational style. No lover of true bustling romance should
miss Phrono. Of couse it will be dramatised; but that operation
won't hurt it much, and the majority of Mr. ANTHONY HOPE'S
admirers will still prefer it as a book. THE BARON.

THE PLEASURES OF HUNTING.
^. No. III.—THE PLEASURE OF HAVING POUNDED THE FlELD AT A BIG WALL IS RATHER SPOILED BY FINDING YOU HAVE LANDED
'ANYHOW" IN A CUCUMBER-FRAME BELONGING TO THE MOST RABID AN JI-FOX-HUNTER IN THE COUNTY, AND KNOWING THAT YOUR
HORSE IS GALLOPING ABOUT ON HIS BOWLINO-GREEN!
THE WOTHERSPOONS.
A STOKY IN SCENES.
IV.
SCENE—The Drawing-room. Some moments have passed since SPENCER
has mentioned the fact of his engagement, and he shows no disposition
to become more communicative.
Henrietta (impatiently). Well, SPEN, can't you see I'm dying
to hear all about her. What is her other name besides MERCY?
Spencer (fseling that here, at least, he is on safe ground). MARI-
GOLD, my dear, MERCY MARIGOLD.
Henr. What a pretty name I I don't remember meeting
When were you introduced to her first, SPENCER?
Spen. (with embarrassment). Why, there was—er—no regular
introduction. It all came about through my walking up to town
through Kensington Gardens. There was a seat where I sat
down to rest—occasionally, you know. And she was always
there, and—whether it began by my making some remark about
the child
Henr. The child 1 SPENCER, you 're not going to marry a
widow?
Spen. (reassuringly). No. ETTA, my dear, no. Ha-ha, I'm not
quite She isn't a widow, anyway. The child wasn't her
own. She—she was only in charge of it.
Henr. But I don't understand. How in charge of it?
Spen. (moistening his lips). Well, it's best I should tell you
at once. (Desperately.) She was a sort of—well, what you
might call by way of being—a nurse, you know, a nurse.
Henr. (to herself, horrified). And I told FRITZ I had no con-
nections his family could possibly (Aloud.) A nurse,
SPENCER! How could you? What induced you to—to Oh,
you can't mean it I
Spen. If you knew all the circumstances, my dear Through
no fault of her own—no fault whatever of her own, she would
have been turned out of her situation to face the world all alone,
poor little girl, if
Henr. Poor little girl? Then she's not Why, how old
is she, SPENCER?
Spen. Ton my word, I couldn't say, exactly. The—the usual
age, I suppose.
Henr. i ou must have some idea. Is she my age?
Spen. Your age I Bless me, no. A good twenty years
younger, I should say.
Henr. That makes her twenty-five, while you are SPBN-
CBR, how can you expect her to feel any real P
Spen. But she does, ETTA, that's the astonishing part of it,
she does. If it hadn't been for that!
Henr. Ah, SPENCER, I can't think you are acting wisely in
marrying anyone so much younger than yourself.
Spen.. If it comes to that, my dear, I might remark that you
are scarcely the person
Henr. (colouring). The two cases are absolutely different,
SPENCBR. FRITZ is considerably older than this girl, and I am
some years younger than you are. And he is of good, if not
noble, family, while she is a—a domestic servant.
Spen. She's very different from the ordinary nursemaid, ETTA.
When you see her to-morrow
Henr. SPENCER, you won't have her here to-morrow? not to
meet FRITZ!
Spen. Why not? Who is FRITZ that he should ?I have
just come from her, ETTA. She is staying with a kind of relation
of hers at Shepherd's Bush. She doesn't seem very comfortable
there, and I hoped that, for my sake, at least, you would have her
here to stay—just till we are married, you know.
Henr. I can t; you are asking too much, SPENCER. You don't
know FRITZ'S feelings about those things. If he even guessed
that he was going to nave a sister-in-law who had been in service,
he might—he might feel compelled to break off our engagement.
Spen. If he's such a snob as all that, I shouldn't say he
would be much of a loss.
Henr. But I love him, SPEN. And it isn't snobbery at all.
You can't expect anyone belonging to an ancient race like the
VON GUBLERS not to have strong prejudices. If you have the
slightest consideration for me, you will not allow this girl and
FRITZ to meet for the present.
Spen. (grimly). Are they to dodge one another in and out of
the house like the little man and woman in a weather cottage,
then. Is that your idea, ETTA, eh?

Henr. Oh, SPENCER, if you would but give it up altogether!
We might have been so happy together, you and I and FRITZ,
while now
•Spe'i- (gloomily). Yes, this changes everything. I see that.
Ihe same house won't hold you and me any longer, ETTA. Well,
MERCY and I must look out for other quarters, that's all.
Henr. But. SPENCER, where would you go? Why, our joint
income ia only just enough to , and we've no rent to p
here. And you d never be happy away from here I'
Spen. I know all that. It will be a wrench; but what can I
do? I daresay we shall settle down somewhere farther out of
town.
Henr. No, SPEN, it's your house as much as mine. If—if one
of us must go, I will be the one. I sha'n't mind it—much.
Spen. Nonsense, HENRIETTA. Do you suppose I 'm going' to
let you turn out of this house when 1 don't even know whether
thia FBITZ of yours is in a position to support you decently?

furniture that was in the old house at Camberwell when we were
children. Father left it to you, SPKNCEK, and you must take it.

to part with 'em. Besides, we—we 're not likely to have much
room for them—in lodgings.

hoping But if you insist on marrying a foreigner fellow who
considers himself too grand to associate with my wife, what can
you expect—what on earth can you expect?
Henr. If she had only been a lady, SPENCER.
Spen. A lady? She is a lady. She's thoroughly refined;
speaks correct grammar, and—and all that sort of thing. It's
the merest accident that she 'a had to go out as a nurse; her
father was a gentleman-farmer, lost all his money, through agri-
cultural depression, and died, I believe. I should have thought,

be managed. But it would be rather a tight fit, and then—sup-
pose MERCY didn't get on with FRITZ?

pered that, even if she wanted to quarrel

After all, if this fellow's confounded family pride should lead mm
to , it would only save poor ETTA from an act of downright
insanity,

cal common-sense, might make poor SPENCER aee how foolishly
infatuated he will be if (Aloud.) Really, SPENCKR, I 'm be-
ginning to feel quite hopeful that it will all come right, somehow.
Spen. Are you, ETTA? So am I, my dear, so am I.
THE CEEWS ON THE EIVEK.
Jteport (nearly) in Common Form.
AGAIN the Eights put in an appearance at Putney. The first
embarked opposite the Leander, and their opponents a little lower
down. The coaches looked after matters from their respective
steam launches, and the crowd was, as usual, enormous. Much
good work was done. A spin from The Doves to Hammersmith
Bridge was accomplished at thirty-four strokes to the minute.
Here "Halt" was called and the crew paddled quietly to the
Limes. Then the men prepared for a strong row. Keeping to the
centre of the river so as to avoid the cross-currents, they com-
menced at thirty-five and gradually increased until they touched
forty-two. Again there was a pause, and after a little further
paddling the crew disembarked and went home. Of course it is
too soon to give a final opinion upon the merits of the competing
sixteen. Before the race there is plenty of time for improve-
ment, and no doubt both crews will take advantage of the patent
possibility. But writing; at the moment it is necessary to say
that one of the sixteen does not finish right home with the handle
of his oar in his chest; that another skies his blade badly; that a

WHEN GREEK (?) MEETS TURK(?)
IT is stated that numerous Englishmen
have offered their services to the Greek
Government, and that the Turkish Govern-
ment has received similar offers from many
other Englishmen. As both these Govern-
ments are practically bankrupt, why waste
—not their money, for they have none, but
—their credit, such as it is, by travelling
to Crete, or Athens, or Constantinople?
How much better to fight comfortably in
London, three hundred on each side, the
Horatii and the Curiatii of to-day. This
scheme would also be more sensible, since
the £1,200 odd subscribed for Greece
would hardly pay all the expenses of a
war with Turkey, and the few hundred
gallant Englishmen on either side could
hardly defy the united forces of the Great
Powers. Then what stirring headlines we

stalls, as it seemed, against their wills by some malignant and
superior power which permitted them to smoke a cigarette and
imbibe a whiskey and soda in the interval between the acts.
Thank Heaven, you are not like one of these clods. You can
laugh, and don't mind showing the world you are enjoying your-
self. So I was not at all sorry to be taken by you to Drury Lane,
and to see the amusing antics and hear the humour of Messrs.
HERBERT CAMPBELL and DAN LENO, born comedians both of them,
with a natural gift of observation and mimicry that it would not
be easy to surpass. You seemed surprised at the excess of my
laughter. “Why, Uncle Bob, I believe you laughed more than
me," was the observation you made. Well, why shouldn't I? The
fact is, I was fresher than you (though you were but a schoolboy
last summer), I had seen less of and lived less of late, I daresay,
in this particular milieu, and the effect on me may have been
greater. You, at any rate, laughed quite sufficiently to relieve
me of any haunting suspicion that by exploding and applauding
as I did I cast any disgrace upon you. You pointed out to me
the hero TRUMBULL who, as you told me, is the grandest heavy-
weight oarsman of his day. Well, TRUMBULL laughed very
heartily, there was no solemn humbug about him, and what may
be allowed to a TRUMBULL is surely not an offence in your uncle.
In any case, if you will so far honour me, I am ready at no distant
date to let you take me once more to a play. But this shall
be during the vacation.
There was at Cambridge in my time a set of men who tried
to live more in London than they did at their University. How
they managed it I can't say, but they were perpetually in town,
and made their lives one round of burlesques, dinners, and
supper-parties, varied by excursions to race-meetings. I am sure
their private means were not ample, yet they always seemed to
roll in money, and glitter with jewellery. Their end was not
peace—but I must postpone what I want to say about them for
another letter. Midnight is booming from Big Ben, and even
uncles must find time for sleep. Farewell.

DEAR Mn. PUNCH, — You are a well-
known advocate of justice, but I imagine
that you are no supporter of Themis
as personified at the Old Bailey. It
has recently been my ill fate to have been
summoned to the Old Bailey—not as a
criminal, but as a witness. I believe, Sir,
in all truth that I should have been better
treated in tha former capacity. If an Eng-
lishman be arrested in Paris, Berlin, Con-
stantinople, or Johannesburg, it is long
odds that he will indite a threatening,
abusive, or piteous letter to the Times,
declaring that he has been thrown into the
society of the scum which always rises to
the top, or amid the cosmopolitan dregs
that generally sink to the bottom.
I cannot conceive, however, that his case
could be worse than mine, that of a law-
abiding, rate-paying and honest citizen.
Day by day for one week, guarded by
inspectors and detectives, I have been
thrust among as offensive a crew as ever
desecrated the name of humanity. Day
by day—for the indictment on which I at-
tended was continually being postponed—I
was forced to be a wretched sufferer.
Raucous ruffians exchanged fearsome jokes
with the New Women of the lowest class,
while impudent scoundrels openly jeered
at the constables who seemed powerless to
secure decent behaviour within a few feet

of the Law. If there be with us a modern

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
MR. GRANT ALLEN has been at considerable pains to write some
historical guide-books for the instruction of travellers. They
deal in detail with objects of art and antiquity, showing how local
habitations grew to what they were once, and then became what
they are now. In Paris, for example, our guide, philosopher, and
friend, posing as Le Diable Boiteux, takes the traveller on a flying
visit, passing over the Champs Elysees, le Tour Eiffel, the Musee
Grevin, and other "vulgar wonders," letting him drop into Notre
Dame, then into La Salute Chapelle, then among the mediaeval
carvings and tapestries of Chiny, and finally deposits him safe
and sound in the galleries of the Louvre. In all these places Mr.
GBANT ALLEN will give you, in the pleasantest manner possible,
a fuller account of the art treasures and of the history of each
place than can be found in the necessarily limited space of a
"common or garden," guide-book. Modestly does out
Diable Soiteux apologise in his preface for not being invari-
ably correct. He owns that some of his information may be
erroneous, and he implores whatever gentle reader may detect
the guide's shortcomings not to be too hard on him, but to speak
gently of the author's slip, and to set him right without un-
necessary harshness, and without causing a rupture between him-
self and his publisher. Any such errors it will take Mr. Sam
Welter's "patent double million magnifyin' gas microscopes of
hextra power" to detect, and it may be with certainty affirmed
of both these historical Guide-Books to Paris and to Florence that
they will be most useful companions to the traveller, and will
afford delightfully instructive entertainment to those who, in
consequence of the res angusta domi, or for any other reason,
can only make the grand tour in their own comfortable arm-
chair at home.
The Story of Aline (CHAPMAN AND HALL) comes to hand in
second edition form. My Baronite ventures to predict that before
long it will have passed far beyond that satisfactory mark of
public esteem. Presumably a first novel, it is marked by rare
workmanship. There is nothing particular about the plot, which
is the old, old story of the wrong people marrying whilst the
right people were within reach, withheld from possession by
temporary accident. But the successive phases are worked out
with surpassing skill. Nothing could be cleverer than the way in
which Mrs. EDWARD RIDLEY Tightly withdraws from the scene,
taking her puppets with her. just when she has brought her
story (or her story has brought her) into a dangerously embar-
rassing situation. The word puppets is here used without pre-
judice. The men and women who work out The Story of
Aline are real flesh and blood, even those of minor importance
being moulded with sure instinct and plastic fingers. Certainly

THE ARMS-BEARER'S VADE MECUM.
Question. What is your reason for as-
suming arms?
Answer. The custom enables me to
adorn my note-paper and furniture in a
pleasing fashion.
Q. Does the assumption need the sanc-
tion of the Heralds' College?
A. Speaking by the card, "yes," but
many arm-bearers are satisfied with the
display of their crest and motto by publi-
city-seeking stationers.
Q. Is there any penalty attaching to the
assumption of unauthorised arms?
A. The earl marshal in olden days had
the right to efface a false armorial bearing
from a shield or the panels of a carriage.
Q. Is it likely that the earl marshal of
to-day would exercise such a right?
A. Most unlikely, as the present Duke
of NORFOLK is a most courteous gentleman,
who would probably shrink from running
the risk of being served with a police court
summons. Besides, his Grace, as Post-
master-General, has other things to do.
Q. Is there any other punishment for
the assumption of false armorial bearings?
A. An occasional exposure in a news-
paper, and the chronic, but partially-con-
cealed, merriment of one's friends.
Q. Is there any defence for assuming a
device without the sanction of the autho-
rities that are in Queen Victoria Street?
A. Certainly; had the heralds continued
their "visitations" beyond the middle of
the seventeenth century, there would have
been no difficulty in ascertaining "who 's
who" at the end of the nineteenth.
Q. Then if SMITH of Tooting assumes
the arms of the Duke of SMITHSHIRB, he is
not to blame P
A. He has no ground but "to the best
of his belief" upon which to work. As
both he and the Peer claim SMITH for a
patronymic, it is possible that there may
be a blood relationship between them.
Q. Would the assumption receive the
sanction of " Gartor " and his associates?
A. No; but they might assist SMITH in
obtaining arms something like the Duke's
in composition, but twice as elaborate and
several times more handsome.
Q. Do you think that there is a univer-
sal blood relationship P
A. Yes, with a common source in NOAH.
Q. Can you not carry the human pedi-
gree further?
A. Certainly, it dates back to ADAM.
Q. But you cannot give the direct line
of ascent from NOAH to EVE'S husband.
A. No more can the Heralds' College.

COURTNEY would some day agree with the
majority of the moment, then would thrill
through the House the joy of the unex-
pected, its one unfailing refreshment.
PRINCE ARTHUR, bound to the labouring
oar, grows fretful. To sit hour after hour
listening to Members opposite saying the
same thing over again at slightly increased
length is a trial to the brazen Mace. For
PRINCE ARTHUR it is torture. Yet if he
followed his impulse, went out to put his
feet on the mantelpiece of his own room
for a glad half hour, he might come back
to find the Vice-President of the Council
had been "saying things." So he sits it
out, and just as when an elderly maiden
lady is about to faint she applies her
smelling-salts, so PRINCE ARTHUR, when
state of coma is almost reached, moves the
closure.
SQUIRE OF MALWOOD, in happier circum-
stances, spares himself an occasional hour's
attendance. Fortune has given PRINCE
ARTHUR a hie majority, tempered by JOHN
o' GORST. Heaven has put the SQUIRE OF
MALWOOD in a minority, but has blessed
him with a blameless ex-Vice-President of
i the Council. Sometimes PRINCE ARTHUR,
sighing, says MALWOOD'S is the happier
state. Certainly ACLAND, standing at the
table discoursing learnedly about the Bill,
makes no angry passions rise. His preach-
ments are disturbed only by wonder that
he has omitted to put on the surplice and
bands good curates usually wear.
The most effective speeches delivered
from Front Opposition Bench in the long
pajaver are HENRY FOWLER'S. Brief,
pointed, comprehensive in view, moderate
in tone, they sometimes almost persuade
PRINCE ARTHUR to concede an amendment.
Resisting the temptation, he pounces
instead.
Business done.—In Committee on Educa-
tion Bill.
Tuesday.—House deeply indebted to
JOHN WILSON of Falkirk for making it ac-
quainted with one of the most delightful
military forces ever paraded off the operatic
stage. The 5th Battalion of the Lanark
Volunteer Scottish Rifles is the full style
blazoned on the scroll of fame. There has.
it appears, been some' little difference of
opinion between the battalion and the
War Office. War Office tyranically used
its authority to disband the battalion.
Forthwith the heather aflame; public
meetings stirred Lanarkshire to lowest
depths of its mines: public meetings held
in every parish; SECRETARY OF STATE
FOR WAR burned in effigy; ST. JOHN
BRODRICK periodically blown up by small
chnrces of cordite.
JOHN WILSON charted to bring matters
under notice of Hieh Court of Parliament.
A loyal Ministerinlist, he did not shrink
from duty imposed upon him. Even moved

talion. For fifteen months it has possessed
no Colonel, and none would undertake the

pany parades no officer was present. This
of less importance, since few of (hem knew
the word of command. If it chanced to be
forthcoming the men did not understand
it. On one occasion a gallant private
marched on parade in his slippers. Leav-
ing the parade-ground after triumphantly
demonstrating their total ignorance of ele-
mentary drill, the men started a feu de
pacity, they dare not move a vote of cen-
sure.
A ringing cheer sent home this shaft.
Vou could almost see it quivering in the
broad breast of the SQUIRE OF MALWOOD
as he stood at the table to answer the
challenge. Party feeling, long pent up in

downward like a cataract. Cheers and

join, firing off blank cartridges. So pleased
with the martial sound that, taking train
homeward bound, they in similar measure
woke the echoes at every station.
A right rollicking, light-hearted crew, the
5th Battalion of the Lanark Volunteer
Scottish Rifles. SARK says they jnust have
b?en originally drafted from Little
Dunkel', the parish famed in song.
0 what, a pirisb, what a terrible parish,
0 what 11 parish is Little Dunkel'!
They hac hangit the minister, drowned tho
precentor,
Dung down the steeple, and drunken the bell!
Business done.—Sat up all night with the
Education Bill.
Thursday.—The SQUIRE lounged in,
studiously looking as if he had just
come up from Malwood after super-
intending tho planting-out of early pota-
toes. "Instead of which," he has been
down at Norwich, saying the most awful
things about the best of all Governments.
The Opposition, who always want someone
to be banged on the head, hail with rap-
turous cheer the poring SQUIRE- A little
later. PRINCE ARTHUR coming in, Minis-
terialists truculently cheer him as if he
had been down at Ipswich saying things
about conduct of the Opposition.
Air evidently charged with electricity.
Presently forked lightning flashes forth,
playing with dangerous energy round two
front benches. DILKB puts question about
the inevitable Crete; JOHN MORI.EY sup-
plements it; PRINCE ARTHUR makes cau-
tious reply on points raised in question.
Then, turnine; with flushed face upon row
of prchangels seated opposite, he declares
he has no satisfaction in answering them,
seeing that, whilst by speeches out of
doors they endeavour to embarrass the
Government to the full limit of their ca-
counter-cheers rang through the Chamber.
If only the SQIURE had been ready to take-
up the gage of battle and fling it back full
in PRINCE ARTHUR'S face, a dramatic situa-
tion of rare intensity would have been
complete. It would have been magnifi-
cent; but it wouldn't have been war.
So the wary Old Parliamentary Hand,
avoiding talk about votes of censure, went
back to speech of French Ministry in
their Chamber last Monday; to what the
MARKISS had said about them on Tuesday;
and to what a pass we have come, when
the Mother of Parliaments, in search of
information closely concerning her brood,
has to go listening at the door of the
French Legislative Chamber.
Jinxincfx done.—Education Bill passed
through Committee.
Friday.—With my Parliamentary papers
from KING of King Street comes an anony-
mous shilling pamphlet entitled The, Earl
and the Knight. Purports to be passages
from a Ministerial Diary, with extracts from
a political correspondence. The only iden-
tity hidden throughout is that of the writer.
For the rest we have boldly presented Lord
ROSEBERV and his colleagues in the Ad-
ministration he formed in March, 1894,
to see it blown to pieces by cordite in the
summer of the following year. A hapless
infant
Called henoe by earlv iloom,
Came but to show how sweet a flower
In Paradice might bloom.
The skit, amusing to those not mentioned
in its pages, is cleverly done. Evidently
from an inside point of view. Of course
Lord ROBEBEHY and SQUIRE OF MALWOOD
would not think of each other as they are
here represented: much.loss would they so
speak. If they did, their potential manner
of saying things is admirably caught.
SARK, guessing at the identity of the
writer, says the clever little joke is of
the sort GEORGE RUSSELL might work
off if he had in his nature even a spice of
acrimony. The thing is decidedly acrimo-
nious, so that guess is ruled out. Besides,
GEORGK RUSSELL is himself spoken of as
disrespectfully as if he were the Equator.
Whoever the author be, he knows *he ropes,
who pulls them, and how.
J3u«iness done.—Navy Votes by hands-
full.
HER OTHER PARTNER.
OF all the pretty girls around
She has the fairest form and face;
I have invariably found,
At any dance, that is the case.
I don't care what your taste may be,
She is the prettiest to me.
Moreover there is in her glance
A something, which I fancy states
My feelings towards her—lucky chance !—
She more or less reciprocates.
Don't contradict me, I must know
What sweetly smiling somethings show.
And see how willingly she hands
Her programme, so that I may choose
'Which dance I like. One understands;
This is a chance one must not lose.
It is as plain as plain can be,
She is not plain, and fancies me.
It seems, however, somewhat strange.
There are not many dances left;
My ioyful feelings rather change,
Alas, of what am I bereft!
And half of them have gone to "C."
I'm hanged! Why, who the deuce is he?
Perhaps her brother? Hardly so.
Perhaps her cousin? Still some doubt.
I must immediately know;
I can't ask hrr to help me out.
I take some dances, three or more;
She smiles as sweetly as before.
Her smile! That quite enchanting smile
I fancied meant she fancied me.
I still believe she does, meanwhile
I wonder wildly who is "C."
Some passing fancy, girlish whim
May make her also smile at him.
If not her relative, why then
How dare he write just "C.," and claim
What is denied to other men,
That she must use his Christian name?
While I put "A. B. B." in full,
For Alexander Bismarck Bull.
And yet her smiles, could they deceive,
Those looks I thought so sweetly thy?
Here 's Jones, I '11 ask him; I believe
He knows her people more than I.

Making the leafless garden gay
With daintiness of flowers,
Before the buds are fully met,
Before the leaves are even set,
By sunshine and by showers.
Pink is the almond-tree above,
The early promise of that love
In Eden first created.
Shooting its glory to the skies
In rosy wreaths of Paradise,
For once regenerated.
Pink is the almond-branch; it tells,
In little peals of long-drawn bells,
Of coming summer glory!
And bidding us forget our grief,
Since it can live without a leaf,
To wait our future story.
Pink is the almond! Just suppose
Our life, like it, couloir de rose!

You know the kind of life I mean,
When even almond-trees are green,
And need not diagnose it!

Despite your cruel mater.

On what, one day, I may expect.—

it's very bad style to knock at a sitting-room door. It's never

VARIETY IS CHARMING.
ONE of the many attractions at the Palace Theatre of Varieties
is The American Biograph, of which moving pictorial series
that representing the horses being rushed away from the burn-
ing stables is far and away the best specimen. These Bio-
graphic pictures are unsteady; only of course this is an opinion
rather dangerous to express in the presence of any malicious
friend who smilingly inquires, "Hallo! where have you been
dining?" It is as well to be prepared for this, and to choose
your audience, or keep your opinion to yourself. However, "all
the other gentlemen noticed the pictures were shaky, and
that was a consoling thought. The French dancing and
singing quartette is full of life, and the fact that these per-
formers, as well as the dancing and acting dolls in the automatic
theatre (which is a special attraction in itself), all sing in
French, and that their hits in this language are most intelli-
gently applauded, shows how wonderfully the education of the
masses, as well as of the classes, has improved within the last few
years in England. CHARLES MORTON is to be congratulated;
only, let him give a hint to the American Biographical exhibi-
tor, advising him that the mot d'ordre must be "Steady, boys,
steady I"

THE PURPLE WEST.
[" The fashionable colour this season is i» be Royal Purple in honour of the
Diamond Jubilee."—Fashion Papin.]
FASHION'S ways are very queer,
Some new colour every year
Becomes the Season's rage at her imperious behest—
And this year the colour new
Is to be the Royal hue.
For all the "Fashion Columns!' have foretold a Purple West.
Not mine the muse who singa
All the fashionable "things."
The lovely gowns and frocks, in which the ladies will be dressed—
I endeavour but to scan
The effect upon the man,
Whom duty or whom pleasure calls to don a Purple West.
'Tis the colour which will dye
Matutinal scarf and tie,
Even "staining the white radiance " of the yespertinal vest;
And light-fingered gutter-snipes
Will prig only purple "wipes,
As they ply their gentle calling up and down the Purple West.
Some touch of purple hue
Everywhere will meet the view-
It will decorate our faces as we jostle with a zest,
When the crowds pour forth this year
In all loyalty to cheer
Our gracious Queen of sixty years throughout the Purple West.
But some things are better—much—
Without any "purple touch,"
If it colours, for example, both the jester and the jest.
And our novel and our play
Will not harmonize, we pray,
With the general scheme of colour for this season in the West I

'IT'S A WISE CHILL THAT KNOWS ITS OWN FATHEB."
Grace. "HAROLD, WHY DID PA CALL THAT MR. BLOWHARD A LIAR?"
Harold. "'Cos HE'S SMALLER THAN PA!"
MORE MANNERS FOR MEN.
In. a Carriage.—If more than six ladies
are going in one brougham—which must
not be pronounced "bruffum "—the gen-
tleman should offer to follow in a cab. If
they insist on his entering with them, he
must stand as well as he can. In such a
case he would not usually smoke.
In a Hansom.—If three men ride in a
liiinsoni, the one whose ancestors coming
over with the Conqueror were least nu-
merous sits forward in the middle. But if
he is very fat, one of his companions may
offer to take his plaee.
In or on an Omnibus.—This is a posi-
tion where ordinary courtesy is quite in-
I sufficient, and where the most elaborate
etiquette prevails. We cannot deal with
it adequately here, and must refer our
readers to our treatise, in six volumes,
entitled Beaux and Bounders in Busses.
On Bikeback.—Never ride at more than
thirty miles an hour. Never touch the
handle with your chin. Never try to run
down a traction engine or an elephant.
Games and Recreations. — Chess and
whist are very useful, but very difficult.
Billiards, backgammon, and baccarat are
quite easy. So are draughts and poker.
They are all played impartially in the
highest circles. Pitch and toss and mar-
bles are less frequent.
Rules of the River on the Road.—In a
flood it is not etiquette to offer to carry
strange ladies. But it the water is more
than six inches deep, and they are in dan-
ger of drowning, a gentleman may rescue
tnem in a punb or a perambulator. A
motor-car is rarely used. Even then it is
wiser to be introduced by a mutual friend.
Dinner Parties.—It is not now usual to
wear armour at the dinner table. Nor is
it customary to carve with one's sword. A
young man ahould avoid anything so old-
tashioned. Breastplates are no longer
used, but soup plates are. The hat should
be left in the hall. It is not worn in
the dining-room. A young man must not
expect to take down a pretty girl. If
hU conversation and behaviour are entirely
regulated by this manual, a lady of un-
certain age, stone deaf and partially blind,
will probably fall to his share. He must
console himself by practising his small
talk upon cer. Arrived at tfie table, he
must place his napkin on his knees, and
not tie it round his neck. He must hold
his knife by the handle, not by the blade.
Soup is not eaten with a knife. If the
beginner has never before eaten anything
anywhere, which is improbable, he can
gaiely eat bread, as a little practice will
soon show him bow to divide that. It is
done with the thumb and fingers, which
then convey to the moutn a piece of the
correct dimensions. A cubic inch is a safe
size. Until he can estimate this correctly,
the beginner would do well to carry an
inch measure in his pocket. As soon as
possible he should learn by heart the pro-
per way to consume asparagus, curry, oy-
sters, Uruyere, nuts, boiled eggs, haggis,
grapes, Neapolitan ices, Irish stew, treacle,
pate de foie gras, melon, bouillabaisse,
Bath buns, birds'-nest soup, mutton chops,
canvas-back duck, sauerkraut, polenta,
&c., Ac. If he forgets whether the under-
cut of roast sirloin of beef should be eaten
with an egg-spoon or not, he will wisely
abstain from the doubtful dish.
At a Ball.—If you can't dance at all,
don't. If you can dance a little, avoid
lulling down. Even if you know her, it is
better not to address your partner with
such a phrase as "Hullo, here you are I
Come along 1 Look sharp 1"
Dress. — This a most important sub-
ject. Don't wear pumps in the Park.
Don't wear brown boots in a ball-room.
Avoid a straw hat at weddings. Never
wear one with a frock coat. Your necktie
can be any colour you like. So can your
braces. Shirt collars are not usually purple.
Nor are patent shoes pink. The correct
evening costume is black. Green is not
customary. The shirt front, according to
the lady novelist, must always be "im-
maculate." Instruct your laundress ac-
cordingly, and explain what the word
means. An umbrella is not generally car-
ried on horseback. It is unusual to play
polo in an Inverness cape.
Personal Speech with. Royalty.—If the
beginner should be honoured with the
friendship of the QUEEN, which is rather
improbable, he must speak to Her Ma-
jesty as "Ma'am." But he need not give
himself much trouble to learn this mode of
address, as it is unlikely that he will want
to use it, and this Manual of Manners, at
the same time.

PHER.—The bread-and-butter misses of my

Hilda Strafford (BLACKWOOD) is the title
that covers two Californian stories by
BEATRICE HARHADEN. In their touches ot
life on the ranche they recall some of BRET
HARTE'S work—the pathos of it, not the
humour. The men are almost idyllically
good, generous, unselfish, full of camara-
derie. There is only one female on the
scene, and Miss HAKRADEN, who knows her
sex, has made her serve as the foil for the
exceeding goodness of man. The stories
are prettily told. But what my Baronite
chiefly delights in is the framework in
which they are set. Turning over the
pages one sniffs the pure air that blows
through the Californian spring, is rested
by the stretches of emerald grass that cool
and cover the feet of the mountains,
scents the golden violets, the wild hya-
cinths, and the pale lavender in the shade.
The Young Clanroy, by the Rev. COSMO
GORDON LANO (SMITH, ELDER), is a stirring
romance of the '45. The author discloses
how the story was originally told to a
party of schoolboys in the dusk of summer
evenings. The published edition benefits
from this origin by reason of the simple,
straightforward style of narrative indis-
pensable to such circumstance. A wider
circle of boys, some bearded, even grey-
headed, will welcome the opportunity of
sitting at the feet of the Dean as he prat-
tles about Prince CHARLIE and of some
who worked and died for him.

all, which is the great thing for reminis-

DESPERATE STRUGGLE OFF THE NINEVEH SOAP-WORKS.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FBOM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, March 22.
—A long time since CALDWELL passed such
hours of exhilarating delight. From open-
ing of sitting there loomed the Public
Health Scotland Bill, a measure of (he sort
his soul loveth. You should have heard
him smack his lips when, holding forth at
proportionate length on this Bill, he
observed that it contained 126 clauses!
Stoutly bound, would make a pleasant book
for the library, to be dipped into when de-
pressed or disappointed.
Before the Scotch Public Health Bill
reached there was the Military Works
(Money) Bill. On this CALDWKLL took a
preliminary canter, a brisk forty minutes,
just to get breathed for the real work of
evening. House, as usual, emptied when
he rose. With exception of one Member
asleep on top bench he had sole possession of
whole space above Gangway on Opposition
side. Not a soul on the Front Bench, over
which, in ecstasy of oratory, he perilously
bent. The attraction for him was the thin
black line of Ministers on Treasury Bench
opposite. BRODRICK in charge of Bill:
CHANCELLOR OF EXCHEQUER watching over
its money provisions; CHAPLIN, with ten-
der recollections of himself, with head pro-
jecting from Turkish Bath-box, wrestling
with influenza; JOKIM and RITCHIE chat-
ting at lower end of bench about repulse
of City in its raid on Southwark. To
these CALDWELL chatters at rate of two
hundred words a minute. Storage appa-
rently illimitable.
"What is the use," he wants to know,
"of talking about reducing the National
Debt when with the other hand you create
a debt covering thirty years?"
Curious effect of speech on Sir JAMES
FERGUSSON, sole occupant at the moment
of benches above Gangway on Ministerial
side. As CALDWELL'B screed continued—
level, loud, incessant, without inflection or
promise of pause, for all the world like one
of the rolls of calico in process of printing
in the paternal mills at Milton-on-Campsie
—FERGUSSON'B eyes rested drowsily on
the figure leaning over back of bench as if
it were edge of pulpit. He caught sight of

the hat planted, rim uppermost, by the
preacher, suggesting tnat presently it
would be carried round the pews, with
intent to take up a collection. His head
dropped gently forward on his chest;
his eyes closed; he dreamed of far off
times in South Australia, in New Zealand,
in sunny Bombay, and so home to snug
anchorage, first at the Foreign Office, then
at St. Martin's-le-Grand. The voice rising
for a moment to a higher pitch, as CALD-
WELL caught sight of JOKIM slinking out
behind SPEAKER'S chair, FERGUSSON awoke;
furtively fumbled in his waistcoat-pocket;
fished forth a peppermint; meditatively
sucked it.
JAMIE for a moment thought he was in
church.
Business done. — Military Works Bill
through Committee.
Tuesday.—Everyone regrets cause ol
physical infirmity which deprives Plymouth
of a moiety of its voice in the House of
Commons. House would admire perse-
verance and courage with which CHARLES
HARBISON ignores a painful fact if they
were exhibited elsewhere. But, really, to
have, as habitually happened in Committee
on Education Bill, a gentleman rising
above Gangway apparently, for the space
of half-an-hour, making a speech, not a
syllable of which travels in articulate form
across the floor, is a little trying to human
patience.
In such circumstances the House is
truly sympathetic, most generously for-
bearing. If it happened on great emer-
gencies, at long intervals, in briefest form,
infliction would be borne, if not gladly, at
least patiently. But, habitually, and at
prodigious length! Well, the House

ation of clerical incomes inequitable and

Thursday.—No one looking round House
to-night would imagine that its business is
final stage of an iniquitous measure, driven
roughshod by tyrannous Minister over a
helpless minority, to the grievous wound-
ing of a great nation. Yet that's about
the size of it, as set forth in speeches from
Opposition benches. Considering the
seriousness of the situation, the stu-
pendous nature of the crisis, Members
admirably succeed in curbing emotion.
Almost the only man who seems really in
earnest about the matter is Lord HUGH
CECIL. For a while he to-night, with the
lever of a living speech, lifted the drear
mechanical debate above the level of angry
assertion and flat denial.
SARK'S prophetic soul beholds in the
Premier's younger son a Parliamentary de-
bater who, if he gives himself up to the
work, will in time (and it need not be a
long time) recall the success of the Lord
ROBERT CECIL who forty years ago sat in
the Commons as Member for Stamford.
He does not possess—or has not developed
—the acrimonious spirit that broue-ht his
noble father, even in those far-off days,
recognition as a master of flouts and gibes.
He is painfully nervous when on his
legs; but he always gets through. He
has something to say, and says it in
phrases that have some of the polish, much
of the literary flavour, of his father's
public speech. He has strong beliefs,
and is terribly in earnest; excellent thines
to begin with. The rest will come with
practice. Already he has secured for him-
self the advantage, inestimable for a younp
speaker, of winning the sympathy and
favour of the House.
Ttiisiness done.—Education Bill read a
third time by 331 votes against 131.

NOTE IN NEXT NEW EDITION OF SHAK-
SPEARE.—Everything the Weird Sisters pro-
phesied came to pass (in some way or other)
except one important item. Generalissimo
Macbeth had been promised a Mayoralty.
How 's that? Well, the sisters were Scotch
spirits, Glen Whiskey Witches, and uncom-
monly neat in appearance, and they would
have pronounced "more hereafter" as
"mair hereafter," which Maebeth's ambi-
tion would have interpreted as "Mayor
hereafter." This is a point that WILLIE
SHAKSPEARE, from want of familiarity with
the Scotch language, has certainly missed.
ADVICE TO THOSE WHO ARE NOT FOND OF

Itinerant organ-men carefully avoid play-
ing anywhere near the house of a practi-
tioner, who can effectually stop or remove
all troublesome grinders.
CHANCE FOR THE JONESES AND SMITHS.—
WTiat is the English surname, or rather the
Wrelsh surname, JONES, when translated
into Rumanian? It is to be found in the
Times report of a discussion in the Ruma-
nian Chamber of Deputies, where a vigor-
ous attack on the Rural Bank Act was
made by Deputy M. TAKE JONBSCO. Take
away "co," and plain "JONES" remains.
Here is a chance for our eminent dramatist.
ENRY HAUTHOR, to translate himself (and
his latest play, The Physician, at the Crite-
rion) into Rumanian and become ENRI
AUTEUR JONESCO. The SMITHS could fel-
low; SMITHESCO and BROWNE^CO would be
mementos of the Jubilee Year.

NEW HELLENISM.—There has been such a
run on second-hand Js.mprieres that the
traffic in Holywell Street has had to be
regulated by the police. The nymph Amal-
thea of Crete, who nursed Jupiter on goat's
milk, has been dragged forth from her well-
established obscurity, and has received a
temporary advertisement, only to have her
name misspelt (as Almathea) by a distin-
guished literary man. The Greek Chargt
d'Affaires has learnt the names of twenty-
eight British authors previously unknown
to him. A special correspondent has taken
an unfair advantage over his confreres in
search of copy by getting arrested as a spy.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THOUGH S. BARING-GOULD is not seen at his very best in
Guava* the Tanner, which, considering its subject, might be
located among his "miner works, yet does the tale abound in
exciting situations, and presents us with a couple of heroines,
the one as good, the other as bad, as they make 'em; a manly
hero and a contemptible pair or more of villains, on whom
poetic justice comes down heavily before the final chapter.
The construction of the story is, like its mining technicalities,
a bit puzzling, while the explanations are, at aU events to the
eager reader who would not willingly be a skipper, somewhat
tedious. For all that the Baron recommends Guayas the Tanner.
Messrs. A. & C. BLACK, by publishing their most useful
Who's Who, show that they decidedly know "What's \\hat."
It brings us up to the very latest date of the County Council
election of March the ninth; it gives us not only the House of
Lords but the Heirs of Peers, which, as a title to a catalogue in
this work, hath a sound calculated to raise the dander of an anti-
peerish Radical who might be inclined to say, " See whatairsthe
Peers give themselves]*' Army, Academy, Bishops, Corporation,
and even "Agents for Cruises," all are here mixed up with Admirals,
Deans, Earls, and Field-Marshals; information as to Ireland and
India; Mems. about Magistrates and Magazines; notes on Navy
and Newspapers, and brief biographies of notabilities from the
first to the last letter of the alphabet, giving even the recreations
of distinguished individuals, one of whom nas recorded how the
little time he has to spare away from his multifarious duties is
devoted to the "recreation" of "amateur soldiering." Delights
ful! What charming pictures of infantry drill in the nursery,
pickets in the pantry, and the charge of the light brigade on
the rocking-horse, does this not suggest! And what is the
recreation of the "retired statesman," Mr. GLADSTONE? It is
simply "Literature." No biking and golfing, such as occupy
the spare time of Rt. Hon. ARTHUR JAMES BALPOUR, Captain
of the Golfers, and President of Cycle-Unionists. Remark a
touching entry in the brief biographical note about the Hon.
Sir ROBERT ROMER, whose "recreations" are "shooting, cycling,
rowing; formerly cricket." The "formerly" might be some-
what sad, were it not that any one of the other three sports and
pastimes would be quite enough for any ordinary individual.
Still can Mr. Justice blithely sing,
I 'm a l!i iMEU, I 'm a ROMSR,
And I '11 be a ROJIKH still!
So "his health and song," and may he long continue to be
"the noblest ROMER of them all." Who's Who is a most use-
ful and companionable book.
It is pretty obvious that if CLARK RUSSELL had never lived
and written his unique Tales of the Sea we should never have had
Captain Castle (SMITH, ELDER). There is the same blameless,
single female on board a sailing ship; the same villainous, mutin-
ous crew; the same gallant sailor who, almost single-handed,
distinguishes himself at every turn of untoward event. There
is the same ocean, but with a difference. No one but CLARK
RUSSELL is able to bring within the binding of a six-shilling
novel (or, for that matter, one published at the old price of a
guinea and a half) the movement, the very smell of the sea.
Nevertheless, my Baronite says, Mr. CARLTON DAWE is an ad-
mirable understudier, his book being, after the manner of the
Master, crammed with vivid incident graphically portrayed.

But needs must when the—Sultan—drives, so on we twang and

THE TEUE PATRIOT.
MB. JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN, in his high-
spirited and patriotic speech at the Royal
Colonial Institute, complained of certain
unfriendly critics who " appear to be under
the impression that nobody but a foreigner
has a right to be a patriot." A hit, a
palpable hit, Sir! Per contra, however,
there ara a yet larger number of people
who appear to hold the equally irrational
opinion that "nobody but an Englishman
has a right to be a patriot"; and that the
patriotism of the foreigner is, to say the
least of it, a mere superfluity of naughti-
ness. Which is absurd! If patriotism is
a crowning virtue in a Briton, it cannot be
a vice even in a Boer. Let us, whether
common citizens of Colonial Ministers, re-
member that the worst enemy of Peace is
he who would make patriotism a monopoly
—anywhere.
A patriot, no doubt, is a fine fellow,
Whether he 's black, or white, or brown, or yellow;
But the win patriot, foe to strife and schiam,
Allows for other people's patriotism.

might not be unwilling, even now (To MEROY, sotto voce.)

No. XI.—OF THB UNDERGRADUATE IN LONDON—OF THE YOUNG
TOWN-BIRD—OF YOUTH AND ENJOYMENT—OF A DOG AND A CAT.
MY DEAR JACK,—Lo, how the weeks slip away] Perhaps on
the very day of your receiving this letter you will be packing
your luggage; paying your bifls (ahem!), and descending upon
the metropolis to witness, as one who, having been behind the
scenes, knows all that is to be known about these two earth-
shaking events, the Oxford and Cambridge Athletic Sports and
the Boatrace from Putney to Mortlake. If you wish to make
my humble rooms your headquarters for a few days before you
go home and rejoice the heart of your mother, I need only tell
you that you wfll be heartily welcome, and that a latch-key, to
be used, as I hope, with the modesty and discretion that are the
most charming qualities of youth, is at your disposal.
Even if I kept no count of the changing seasons by any other
method, I should know the advent of the University Vacation by
the appearance of our London streets. At every step you meet
the slim and springy figures of the undergraduates, their fresh
and cheerful faces somewhat overcast, it must be admitted, by
the dread responsibility attaching to frock-coata, patent-leather
boots and neckties, that in their ample magnificence leave but
little to the imagination. Two of them, it may be, while walk-
ing irreproachably down St. James's Street, and reciting to one
another the awe-inspiring names of the various clubs they pass,
see a friend advancing to meet them. They saw him last at
Cambridge two days before, when they parted from him at the
end of a Term spent in his society. What does that matterP
The three greet one another with a surprised enthusiasm that
might be the result of years of separation. There are slappings
on the back, hearty welcomings, immediate offers of cigarettes:
"Why, old man, fancy meeting you here 1 What have you
been doing all this time? When did you come down P Where
are you off to? Are you doing anything to-night? Capital!
Let 'a dine together and go to a play." And so they hook arm-
in-arm and away they go together as if the whole world with all
its hopes and pleasures were theirs. The town-bird, even when
recently fledged, is of a different order. Heaven forgive him,
he has been through everything and seen through everybody;
for him everything is vieux jeu; he sees no more in life than bir
CHAHLBB COLDSTREAM (I think it was he) saw in the crater or
Vesuvius, and he passes on his way, a parched and pleasureless
being, to whom the world is as flat as the late Mr. HAMPDEN
always maintained it to be. Even amongst undergraduates, I be-
lieve, this pattern has its imitators, who ape the man of the world,
attempt to disguise themselves in a mask of cynicism, and put
away from them forcibly all the joy and freshness and heartiness
of youth. These are the youngsters—their numbers, I am
thankful to say, are few, but should be fewer—who haunt the
pleasure-palaces of London even in Term-time, whose highest
ambition is to be mentioned in print as the associates of Lais
or Phryne. and who find, when the unrelenting years have
stranded them on the barren shore of middle age, that they
have never been young or enjoyed themselves with a genuine
enjoyment. Of these are not you. No, my dear JACK, enjoy
yourself while you can, and don't be afraid of showing your
feelings. It is a great thing to have friends, to hear their
welcome as you greet them, to get all the good you can out ot
this delightful world and all that it contains of fresh, manly,
honest pleasure while the fresh capacity for pleasure is still

the subject of Tatters' arrival, and it is probable that a tempo-
rary sanctuary will have to be arranged so that there may be

tinged with grey approached her.
"Impossible!" he exclaimed, and there
was sorrow in his voice. "What is there
in common between us?"
"Everything," was the brief but com-
prehensive reply.
"You are mistaken," he comtinued, with
a heartfelt sob; "indeed you are. I tell
you that the past stands between us. I
am an outcast. My friends that I have
not seen for many months are no more.
I am alone. The years that are gone
have carried away the dreams of youth and
the realities of middle age."
"You surely take a pessimistic view of
the situation.
"Indeed, I do not!" he urged mourn-
fully. "What would I not give for my
past youth! If I were three years younger
there might be some hope. But no, I am
too old! The wings of the elderly butter-

flutter from flower to flower."
"I do not believe it; I cannot believe it."

me, and I scarcely know my way down

"It is never too late to mend," said the
beautiful girl, encouragingly.
"Your suggestion comes from a half-
forgotten copy-book. No, no, it can never
be. All my companions are gone. I will
follow their example. I, too, will away to
some desert island, where the aged can
meet their peers. I live in the past. I
have no power of existing in the future."
"This is cruel," cried the girl, sobbing
bitterly. "Can you not see that I am
dying for your proposal, that I am ready
to become your wife?"
"Believe me, such a thing might have
happened five years ago. But now it is
too late."
"Nothing is too late—except perhaps
a play in five acts, which commences at a
quarter to eight, and ends at about half-

EECIPROCITY.
PEAR MR. PUNCH,—No doubt you have observed that the
Chancellor of the Diocese of London has decided that Governor
BRADFORD'S story of the Pilgrim Fathers shall be handed over
to the Ambassador of the United States. Very right and
proper, and possibly other records of historical interest to our
relatives across the Atlantic might be added to the log of the
Mayflower, with the best results. For instance, could not that
bill for SUAKSPBARB'S bed be recovered and transmitted? If it
were receipted (there is a certain virtue in the "if") it is sure
to have been preserved somewhere. Then HAMPDEN'B ticket for
America, which was never used, might be discovered and for-
warded with the rest. Perhaps it would be too much to send
the original of Magna Charta, but there is (if I am not mistaken)
a capital duplicate at Salisbury, which might be brightened up
a bit and posted to Boston. There were claims, too, against
the British Government, at the commencement of the present
century, for compensation for losses incurred during the War
of Independence, by the Mandamus Councillors of the King.
Mavbe, if these were duly forwarded to Washington, they would
be honoured in a fashion beneficial to the descendants of those
misguided Loyalists who preferred GEORGE the Farmer to
GEORGE of the Stars and Stripes. Such a gift would be some-
thing of a set-off to the Alabama Claims that were so promptly
honoured in this country. Lastly (if it has not already gone),
could we not send out the kind heart of the great British nation?
This would be following a precedent set by Sir HENRY IRVING.
All I would sugpest in return for these simple gifts is a present
of a fraternal good will, an article which, wherever it may exist,
is certainly not to be found in the American Senate.

EXTRACTED FHOM TBB DIAKY OP TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Tuesday, March 30,
2 A.M.—Members just streamed forth from
heated air into cool March morning. Un-
like the month the sitting, coining in like ;i
lamb, went out like a Hon. Ireland to
begin with, Ireland for once almost hys-
terically unanimous. Report of Royal
Commission on Financial Relations appears
to promise opportunity of getting an extra
million or so per annum out of the imperial
exchequer. In such a cause what Irishmen
would not be friends? As the Lord Mayor
of Dublin—who, dressed all in his best,
presented at bar a petition in favour of
readjustment of financial relations of the
two countries—beautifully said, "Let us,
me boys, bury the hatchet of private ani-
mosity in the bosom of the public purse."
HI.AKH presented Ireland's case in monu-
mental speech. A sort of Whitaker's
Almanark-cum-Burdett's Official Intelli-
Qfn&. Crammed with facts and figures;
the long procession ably marshalled; the
argument forcefully hammered home in
lucent language, occasionally ennobled by
simple eloquence. When he sat down
there really didn't seem anything left for
anyone else to say. unless it were the
monosyllabled "No" by CHANCELLOR OF
EXCHEQUER. That would never do in
House of Commons, especially in debate
on Irish subiect. So more speeches fol-
lowed, all of length commensurate with
BLAKE'S.
Midnight mercifully intervened: Members
instinctively turned their thoughts home-
ward, but not their steps. Report of
Supply next order. This free from domina-
tion of Twelve o'Clock Rule; debate may
go on as long as there are forty Members
awake to keep it going. PHILIP STANHOPE,
the PHILIPPE EGALITE of a milder century,
flung on dying embers of sitting a flask of
oil fresh from Crete. Instantly they blazed
up, filling the erewhile sleepy chamber with
fierce flame and stifling smoke. PRINCE
ARTHUR, seething with righteous wrath,
protested against "fragmentary, inconclu-
sive and unsatisfactory debates" upon a
delicate and difficult, question. JOHN DIL-
LON gave new Members a taste of his

quality in coercion days. GEORGE CURZON
ran amuck at gentlemen below Gangway
opposite. TIMHEALY long resisted tempta-
tion to associate himself with anything
partaking of the character of a free fight.
At end of hour and half was dragged in,
and soon made up for lost time.
A lively skirmish presaging the pitched
battle that can't be long deferred.
Business done.—Mixture of Ireland and
Crete; taken hot.
Tuesday night.—General disposition to
regard as exaggerated the note in an
eminent Frenchman's diary of his visit to
an English country house. "It's a fine
morning," he represents his host as saying;
"let's go out and kill something."
The libel finds some support in episode in
connection with occupation of Crete. After
taking part in bombardment of blockhouse
at Malaxa Admiral HARRIS felt irresistible
impulse to go and kill something. TUTKS
forbidden; insurgents for the moment
quiet; someone suggested snipe. So
whilst Europe trembles on brink of war, all
its capitals throbbing with excitement, the
British Admiral goes a snipe-shooting.
Would never have heard of expedition only
for fact that insurgents, not to be out-
done in activity, tried to pot the Admiral
on returning to his ship, a circumstance
which to the true sportsman lends addition il
charm to snipe shooting in Crete.
Question about it in House to-night.
TIM HBALY puts another, which, as usual
with him, goes straight to the point. "Will
the Admiral in future," he asks, "confine
himself to snipe shooting?" GEORGE CUR-
ZON, not having had even private notice of
question, does not feel bound to answer it.
House chuckled with delight at this pros-
pect of settlement. Suppose Admirals of
united fleets all go a snipe-shooting, leav-
ing the Cretans to settle their private long-
standing account with the Turks?

[APRIL 10, 1897.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Debate on financial relations of England
and Ireland resumed. Debate perhaps not
proper name for process. It is the reading
or reciting of long essays. EDWARD
CLARKE, not to be quite outdone by a
gentleman from Canada, spoke for an hour
and three quarters against BLAKE'S two
hours and ten minutes. A pretty spec-
tacle, though the performance a little
prolonged. BLONDIN in his prime never
so neat in execution as EDWARD CLARKE
practising on the tight-rope of Home Rule,
with assistance of a pole weighted at one
end with "Justice to Ireland," at the
other with "Unity of the Empire." So
well done that when he lightly leaped down
and bowed acknowledgment of applause
"Is it your pleasure that leave be
given?" asked the SPEAKER.
"No." cried the guilty Ministerialists.
"Yes," roared a full-throated Opposi-
tion.
Challenged for supporters, over three
score Liberals rose. Leave accordingly
given. SWIFT MACNEILL submitted his
case, bringing guilt home to door of the
doubly-absent Minister. Never in Parlia-
mentary history was speech so effective.
It literally paralysed the audience. No one
rose either to further indict or to attempt
extenuation. Nothing to be done but to
put the question, and, motion for adjourn-
ment negatived, House proceeded to or-
dered business.

The Tiimc Minister and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs take an (un-)" Conititutional"
together in the South of France!
no one quite knew what was his exact posi-
tion with respect to Amendment before
House. Business done.—More union among
Irish Members. New reading of old say-
ing: "Union is Cash."
Thursday. — SWIFT MACNEILL strode
down to House to-day full of fell purpose.
In spito of occasionally terrifying attitude
and thunderous voice, he is one of the
gentlest-hearted mon in the world.
Wouldn't hurt a fly, even if its Saxon
birth stared through its lucent eyes and
betrayed itself in the movement of its
tremulous legs. But there are things
which pass the limits of fabulous forbear-
ance. The MARKISS'S absence from the
United Kingdom just now is one such.
If he were merely the Premier, 'twere bad.
If he were solely Foreign Secretary, 'twere
regrettable. He is both, a Ministerial
amalgam, the component parts forming
most indispensable element in Cabinet.
That he should be making holiday on the
Riviera whilst the dogs of war are baying
round Crete is the unpardonable sin.
SWIFT MACNEILL will, at whatever cost to
private feelings, perform a public duty. So,
questions over, he rose, asked leave to
move adjournment in order to discuss as
matter of urgent public importance the
absence from the United Kingdom of the
PRIME MINISTER and FOREIGN SECRETARY.
Painful later to observe surprise on faces
of crowd of Liberal Members who had
supported demand for leave to move ad-
journment. Standing Order requires that
Members approving shall rise to their feet.
Being on their legs in token of their burn-
ing desire to hear SWIFT MACNEILL'H
speech. Members walked out, coming back
alter brief interval, surprised to find all
was over.
Business done.—The MARKISS narrowly
escapes being sent to the Tower.
Friday.—PRINCE ARTHUR entering just
now, glanced eagerly at Front Opposition
Bench, scanning it in vain for towering
form of its Captain. SQUIRE OF MAI.WOOD,
careful for a life dear to us all, wisely
keeps to his room this bleak April day.
PRINCE ARTHUR urgently wants to know
how about that Vote of Censure? Nothing
would please him better than to have the
glove dashed down. Signs on the horizon
of restlessness among his own men at news
of British ships taking active part in
league with fleet coercing Greeks and
firing on Cretans. A Vote of Censure
would close up their ranks, strengthening
at home and abroad position of Ministry
by overwhelming majority.
"Will you walk into my parlour?" says
PRINCE ARTHUR to the SQUIRE.
"Perhaps," says the wary SQUIRE. "By-
and-bye. But you must really allow me to
choose my own time for calling."
Business done.—In the absence of his
esteemed Leader, SAGE OF QUEEN ANNK'B
GATE endeavoured to raise debate on
Crete. Didn't raise it much.
THE MILITIA OFFICER'S VADE MECUM.
Question. What advantage do you derive
from your commission as a commander in
"the old constitutional force?"
Answer. The satisfaction of feeling that
T. am doing my best to secure my country
from invasion.
Q. Is that sentiment universally influen-
tial?
A. No; for the militia is sadly in need
of officers. The roll is no less than 700
short of the authorised establishment.
Q. Leaving out of the question your con-
science, do you obtain otter satisfaction?
A. Scarcely; unless it be satisfactory to
be sneered at by the regulars and jeered at
by the volunteers.
Q. Are there not social advantages at-
taching to the commission of a Militiaman?
A. Undoubtedly. It is a qualification for
membership to the Senior Service Clubs,
but as the elder sons go into the reserve,
and the younger brothers to the active
battalions, the former are eligible for in-
stitutions of equal distinction.
Q. You can put your rank on your cards?
A. A questionable advantage, as the
grade should be accompanied, to avoid
ridicule, with the number of a militia bat-
taUon—a reference suggestive of amateur
soldiering.
Q. Is the training of the militia, then,
mere child's play?
A. Certainly not; as a battalion man-
ages to get through more genuine hard
work in twenty-seven days than the regu-
lars do in a quarter, or even six months.
Q. Is this fact recognised by the public
and the Government?
A. The public know nothing about it,
and the Government accept it officially,
and then ignore it.
Q. Does not a commanding officer take
a pride in the efficiency of his militia regi-
ment?
A. If he does, he is still haunted with
the knowledge that at the first talk of war
about half of his men will be drafted into
the active battalion, and their places sup-
plied by raw recruits.
(,). But surely he should be pleased to
think that the militia is the nursery of the
regular army?
A. He might regard the reflection with
satisfaction if he obtained the slightest re-
cognition of his patriotic unselfishness.
Q. Speaking as a patriot, how would you
fill the vacancies in the commissioned ranks
of the militia?
.1. By causing all subalterns to pass
from "the old constitutional force" into
the regulars, and sending back seasoned
warriors into the battalions first associated
with their names in the Army List.
Q. Have you any reason for believing
that this scheme is the best possible?
A. Yes; as it has already been received
with general approval by a body of experts
meeting recently at the Royal United Ser-
vice Institution.
Q. Is such a gathering as that to which
you refer to be relied on for sound sense?
A. Unquestionably; when its members
are permitted to speak thejr minds without
regard to the opinions dfficially formulated
in Pall Mall or at the Admiralty.

TIME DOES SEEM BO LONG WHEN YOU 'RE WAIT- I
ING FOR TOUR WlFB, WHO IS SHOPPING, i
THAT SOMETHING OF THE ABOVE OUGHT REALLY TO BE STARTED FOR THE POOR HUSBANDS.
MY TEN-ACT COMEDY.
I HAD written a comedy. In my opinion
it was bright and sparkling. I am a very
unprejudiced person, especially where my
own work is concerned. I had sent the
manuscript to a well-known London
manager, feeling pretty confident that
it would be accepted without much hesita-
tion. Imagine then my surprise and an-
noyance, when the play came back with a
polite intimation that it was not thought
suitable for the Piccadilly Theatre.
"There must be some mistake," said I to
myself. So I drove to the theatre. I sent
my card in to Mr. JOHN ASHBURNHAM, the
managerj and in less than five minutes was
ushered into that gentleman's comfortable
little sanctum.
"I have never had the pleasure of meet-
ing you before, Mr. WILLIS," he said;
"but, if I remember rightly, you have
written a play."
"It is about that play that I have come
to see you," I said.
"I guessed as much," replied Mr. ASH-
BURNHAM. '' I always make a point of
seeing authors when they call upon me—
especially unknown authors," he added,
with that peculiarly sweet smile which has
really made his fortune on the stage. "And
at present you are an unknown author, are
you not?"
"I am," I answered, with quiet dignity.
"The comedy which I submitted to you a
fortnight ago is my first dramatic work."
By this time we had settled down into
two comfortable chairs, and I thought it
better to bring him to the point.
"My comedy has been sent back to me
this morning," I remarked. "By mistake,
I presume?"
"Oh! no," he answered, gently; "not
by mistake."
I looked at him in amazement. "Do
you mean to tell me," said I, "that it is
rejected?"
"'Returned' is a softer word," he mur-
mured.
I felt, of course, intensely indignant, but
I managed to control my feelings.
"You owe me an explanation," I said,
very quietly.
"You shall have one," replied Mr. ABH-
BURXHAM. "Your comedy is in ten acts."
I saw what he meant. I had not written
enough.
"I could make it fifteen, if you wished,"
I said. "Then the play might last for three
nights. Five acts a night. It would be so
good for business. At the end of the fifth
act the stage manager might come in front
and say, 'To be continued^in our next.'"
"It is a good idea," said Mr. ASHBURN-
HAM. "Now, your first act is all talk.
Talk, talk, talk!"
"Naturally," I replied. "Did you think
I meant it for a dumb-show play P"
He smiled. "Your second act again is
talk—all talk."
"You are hypercritical," said I. "Does
not the servant in the second act bring on
a box of toy bricks to amuse ALGERNON
and his friends? Grown men playing with
toy bricks after dinner! Was there ever
such a delightful incident!"
"The public would never stand it," said
the manager, wearily. "The pit and
gallery would simply howl."
"And then," he added, "you introduce
a long solo on the bassoon in the middle of
the third act. Why, that would stop all
the action of the piece."
"You are wrong," I exclaimed; "quite
wrong. At that point, as you yourself
must admit, the action of the piece has
not yet commenced. The action cannot
possibly be interrupted when it has not
begun."
"There is some truth in what you say,"
answered Mr. ASHBURNHAM. "Still, if you
must have a bassoon solo, I should have
preferred it between the acts."
"But you have not noticed my brilliant
satire, and my sardonic humour," I urged.
"That is true," said the manager; "I
have not. However, I have noticed that
you jntroduce fifty-four speaking charac-
ters into your play"
"All good parts," I cried. "You must
allow that."
"And it contains just plot enough for a.
one-act farce," he added, without noticing
my interruption.
"Such an opportunity for costumes,
isn't it?" said I.
"Yes; in that respect, I admit, the play
is distinctly clever."
"I really think you had better accept
it," I suggested.
"Not in its present form," said the
manager. "You still have something to
learn about the art of dramatic construc-
tion."
I demurred.
"Nay, but you have indeed," and he
smiled again that fascinating smile. "Take
Mr. PINERO as your model. He is a past-
master in the art of construction. Buy a
copy of The Magistrate, and study that.
Above all thyigs, let your play have a plot.
The audience generally feel more interest
in a plav when it has a plot. Avoid mere
talk."
I was nearly heartbroken, and it was
with difficulty that I could repress my
emotion.
"Must I cut out my brilliant satire," I
asked, with a choking sob, "and my sar-
donic humour?"
"Only beginners attempt that kind of
thing," said Mr. ASHBURNHAM. "Make
PINERO your model. Master his Magis-
trate. Mould yourself upon his methoas,
and then, depend upon it, you will never
write a dull play."
I am going to take Mr. ASHBURNHAM'S
advice. I have put my ten-act comedy
into the fire; I have bought a copy of The
Magistrate; and now I am going to imi-
tate Mr. PINERO to the very best of my
ability. And what is more, I intend to go
next week to the St. James's Theatre, and
see his latest piece, The Princess and the
Butterfly. I hope to learn a great deal
from that.

LOKDON.
DEAR MISTER,—In face the dragon at the entry of the City—
that dragon of pantomime to make to die of to laugh—finds
himself an all other monument, an edifice of the most lugubrious
the Palace of Justice. The fafade is one can not more gothic
and severe, and the tower is suchly heavy and menacing tha
one forgets almost the gaiety of the dragon at the middle of thi
street. The Conciergene at Paris is of the same style, equall;
sombre, but she was anciently a prison. Our Palace of Justice
to us is not as the yours. Nor the one nor the other is as grea
as the Palace of Justice at Brussels. "Savez-vous," as say th<
brave Belgers, they can to vaunt themselves la-bas, there low
of an edifice of the most enormous. Savez-vous, he takes a
cake, as say the English. But, savez-vous, he has cost to them
almost as much as their State of the Congo!
A mister of my acquaintance has told me that, at place of t
mount to the public galleries in your Palace of Justice, a man
in hat high of form can to pass the agents of police at the doo
if he marches all right, tout droit, and that he has the air verj
occupied and very pressed. I do as that one certain morning
and I arrive without difficulty to the Hall of Lost Steps.
There is not there anyone! Quclle salle enorme, absolumen

the end of the immense hall, one sole man, evidently a com

Commissioners of the National Debt. I have heard to speak o
them. The hall has cost too much dear, and he is that whic
one calls "the man of possession" who represents the creditor
of the nation.
Then at side I perceive, on a species of etiquette, th« name
of several courts. It is at the entry of a tunnel. My frien

I enter immediately in the tunnel. For the moment I believ

I arrest myself. The moment of after something rolls at my

le object lifts himself I see a fat mister, tout ensouffle, who is
alien in descending a spiral staircase of whom I perceive the
rst marches. If I were not actually in the Palace of Justice of
!ie free England, country of the "Habeas Corpus Bill," I should
elieve myself in an oubliette of a middle-aged castle. At the
Bast I am arrived by error in the caves, in the subterraneans,

nd his umbrella, at the aid of some ones of my matches, ex-
licates to me that all the staircases are as that. And suspecting
robably that I am stranger, he counsels me of not to essay an
iscension so dangerous. Then he disappears in the obscurity.

essaying of to go out, attacks me from the other side of the
curtain, marches on my feet, hits me on the chest, and smashes
my hat. In this terrible moment another invisible assailant
crushes me in opening the door. Enveloped of the curtain,
incapable of to defend myself, suffocated, smashed, I push a cry

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
MR. HENRY FROWDB lays at the feet of his Sovereign the
tribute of a Diamond Jubilee Bible and Prayer Book. The
volumes are produced in the perfection of style and work-
manship that marks the Oxford University Press. The Bible
contains two portraits, one a reproduction of a picture of
the girl-Queen as she looked forth from the recesses of a charm-
ing poke-bonnet in the first year of her reign. The other is,
apparently, the latest photograph taken of the venerable
Sovereign. The volume is further enriched by reproductions of
the cartoons painted by Sir JOSHUA REYNOLDS in 1778 for the
window of New College, Oxford. There are two other portraits
of the QUEEN in the Prayer Book, one taken from a painting by
AGLAIO about 1837, the other a recent photograph. In both she
is presented standing, crowned, and wearing her robes of State.
Hul, my Hai-unitc wntes, between the two lies the long journey
of sixty years.
Tlie Book of Parliament, by MICHAEL MACDONAGH (ISBISTEH
& Co.), is a masterpiece of compendious information. It tells in
lucid manner everything that may be known about the Constitu-
tion and Procedure of both Houses of Parliament. Considering
the mass of detail dealt with, and the amount of information con-
veyed, the range of accuracy attained is remarkable. My Baronite
observes only one error in date, and that is probably a misprint. A
more serious blemish is misquotation of what Mr. MxoDoNAGH
calls "the famous saying of Lord ROSEBBHY," privily addressed
to my Baronite immediately after the fall of the Ministry in
1895. In A Diary of the Home Rule Parliament the text will
be found to run thus:—"There are two supreme pleasures in
life. One is ideal, the other real. The ideal is wnen a man
receives the seals of office from the hands of his Sovereign. The
real pleasure comes when he hands them back." Lord ROSEBERY

"DEAR SIR,—In reply to your well-

tion, 'Should Greece be blockaded?' I can
only say that it is quite without the possi-
bilities of a private person to gauge with
accuracy the conditions of the situation in
Eastern Europe. Nor is it within the
scope of one, who has retired into purely
philosophical studies, to determine the
balance which hangs between the Hellenes
and the so-called Great Powers. At the
same time I have no hesitation in saying
that the traditions of Marathon must be
maintained, and that some remembrance of
Salamis should act as a preventive to
further aggression on the part of nations
possessing no qualification for attempting
the duties of marine police amid Homeric
remains."

DEAR AND LEARNED Sin,—As you are
admittedly the mouthpiece of Justice, will
you allow me to call your attention to
the resolution which has recently been
passed by the General Council of the Bar
objecting to counsel "holding the office of
Town Clerk, Clerk to Guardians, or any
similar public office" taking private prac-
tice? The Committee have gone further.
They have sent a resolution to the Benchers
of the four Inns of Court, contending that
"It is undesirable that a person holding any
such office should be called to the Bar."
I can quite understand the feeling that has
prompted this action. Competition is keen
in our profession, and we—no doubt—
would prefer to keep Town Clerks and the
like to their work to the exclusion of any
other duty. But the suggestion that a
person holding the positions referred to
should not be called to the Bar hints at the
undesirability of Barristers themselves ac-
cepting such appointments. To this, for
reasons of a sell-evident character. I can-
not possibly agree. And as I speak as the
representative of a very large majority of
my colleagues, I trust you will give pub-
licity to my opinion. Yours truly,
A. HuitirJ.ESS, JUNIOR.

P.S.—I may say that were I offered such
an appointment I would relinquish my pri-
vate practice at once. I may add, that
with some such career in view I have for
many years past been reducing the number
of my clients. Should corroboration be
needed my clerk, Mr. PORTINQTON, will be
happy to show my fee-book. Of course,
only to members of the profession.

DEAR MR. PUNCH,—I am staying in a first-class hotel, "re-
plete" with every comfort, with magnificent scenery laid on
every floor, a snow-capped mountain-range in the back-garden,
and a romantic gave, or river, in the foreground. All this you will
see from the hotel note-paper, which, in accordance with custom,
shows all the other adjacent establishments very properly dwarfed
to an insignificant size. But what I want specially to point out
to your discriminating readers is the superexeellence of the litera-
ture in our Salon de Lecture. I have just been taking a rough
inventory, and find there is something to suit every taste. The
centenarian will discover here the newspapers of his early youth,
the hypochondriac can study the illustrated Album des Villes
d'Eaux et de Sains de Mer and the Medical Press of sixteen
months ago, and the golf-maniac has The Little Folks' History r,f
England and The British Journal of Commerce for October, 1896.
provided for him—in fact, the assortment is as completely varied
and classic as the interesting collections usually to be seen on
the tables in dentists' waiting-rooms. Besides these, there is a
well-preserved copy of Westralia (dated July 23, 1896), and a
Post-Office Directory, which I am sure would appeal to the lady
visitors, when they are tired of looking at the Annuaire de Com-
merce for 1890, or the Time-table of the London and North
Western Railway. And there are several fascinating back num-
bers of the Gentlewoman, and Hearth and Home, not more than
ten months old, which the stray gentlemen who wander hither
from the smoke-room will no doubt be delighted to read from
cover to cover. I notice they always do at home, being highly
(and naturally) interested in the advertisement pictures.
The drawing-room table also contains several important French
publications, such as L'Ami des Campagnes, Le Monde Thermal,
and La Collection de Mme. Roland, which, I regret to say, are
not as much appreciated as they should be. The French journals,
also, which give some intensely thrilling provincial news, with
occasionally a foreign telegram of certainly within the last week,
I regret to say, are scarcely ever removed from their wrappers.
The Financial News and various Store catalogues are taken in for
the benefit of the invalids, who derive much pleasure in turning
the familiar pages over and over again. There is a charming
work on Russia (in French), with only a few pages missing, on a
what-not in the corner; a handy-guide to the Peak of Derbyshire,
and a Visitors' List of the Swiss Resorts form not unattractive
additions to the collection; while the piece, de resistance is perhaps
the Album Naturel de la Fabrique et de I Industrie. This is truly
light reading after the heavy and excellent dinners provided us.
For those who shun newspapers, even though a year old, there
is a beautiful and novel toy in the shape of a stereoscope. This
would be a still greater success if the photographs, which ex-
hibit family groups in the costume of the sixties, were not
somewhat tattered and fragmentary. This about completes the
contents of our Salon, but I think I have written enough to shew
that, though far from Fleet Street, we are not without food for
the mind. Yours fatuously, Z. Y. X.

Will Britannia rule the waves witr
greater freedom if you manoeuvre in the

Will JOHN BULL sleep more soundly if
you deafen yourself and your neighbours by
firing off an unlimited number of blank

Will the Concert of Europe be strength-

until after your lunch, and taking that
meal later than your customary dinner-
time?
Will the cause of International Federa-

ploughed fields for eigh t hours at a stretch?
Will Australia advance at a quicker pace

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED PROM THE DIARY OP TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, April 5.—
Everyone glad to see the SQUIRE OF MAL-
WOOD back again to-night. PRINCE
ARTHUR, who instinctively does the gra-
cious thing, said so amid cheers from
both sides. Young bloods on Tory benches
sometimes affect to make light of the
SQUIRE, interrupt him when he is speak-
ing, jeer when he rises to purple heights of
oratory. But in its secret heart the
House, independent of party, is proud of
the SQUIRE, recognising in him the greatest
Parliamentarian left, the final practitioner
in an old school which Time has long been
busy breaking up.
Coming back in rather subdued mood
after a week's wrestling with that practised
athlete the Influenza, the SQUIRE is, per-
haps, just a little mild in manner. Has
brought with him notice of a resolu-
tion forbidding employment of forces
of the Crown against the kingdom of
Greece or the people of Crete. PRINCE
ARTHUB, jumping at opportunity, wants
him to call it a Vote or Censure. In his
mellowed mood the SQUIRE declines. How,
he asks, can they move a vote of censure
upon the Government till they know pre-
cisely what is their line of policy? All his
proposed motion designs is to bring out a
full declaration of the intentions of Her
Majesty's Government with respect to
Greece and Crete.
His coyness increases desire of PRINCE
ARTHUR to be assailed. Amid loud cheers
from Ministerialists spoiling for a fight
PRINCE ARTHUR walks up ana down before
Kront Opposition Bench, temptingly trail-
ing his frock coat. Won't SQUIRE tread on
its tail? Words cannot describe the look
of ineffable benevolence that mantles the
broad visage of the SQUIRE. Why should
he tread on anyone's coat, least of all on
the garment of his interesting and amiable
young friend? A man of peace, he desires,
above all things, to avoid strife. Moreover
than which, if yielding to sudden tempta-
tion he were to accept the challenge per-
sistently fluttered in his face, he would con-
fer great tactical advantage upon the
enemy. At the first sound of pitched
battle Ministerial ranks would close up;
the faintest murmur of independent criti-
cism would be hushed; Ministers would
obtain a rattling majority that would en-
able them to go their way for rest of
Session, snapping their fingers in face of
discredited Opposition.
These, however, mere details. It is be-
cause moved by larger, nobler passion for
peace and quietness, that the SQUIRE
smilingly shakes his head and keeps his
foot clear of the temptingly trailed coat.

Great Powers being broken one of them
were to swoop down on Icelandj making it
what Dr. JAMESON would call a jumping-off
ground to seize Orkney and the adjacent
islands of Great Britain and Ireland? Day

A HEARTRENDING AITBAL!
Mr. S-lf-r eingt—
"Won't anybody move a Vote of Censure now

and night the fear has haunted him. He
thought of calling upon Lord WOLSELEY
to discuss the situation. But he knows
that military men in high command are
absurdly jealous of their position, and re-
sent suggestions from civilians. The ad-
vantage of adopting such a course is evi-
dent. The communication would have
been private. The other alternative, ques-
tioning the Ministers in the House of
Commons, would put the enemy on the
alert, might even suggest to him the
masterly manoeuvre.
However, for reasons stated, Mr. WEIR
decided to risk consequences. To-night
confronted UNDER SECRETARY FOR WAR
with problem. BRODRICK put best face on
matter. Mr. WEIR'S suggestion is, that
in order to resist any swooping down of
a piratical power from Iceland, steps should
be taken to fortify the north-west coast
of Scotland. ST. JOHN BRODRICK frigidly
replied that the joint Naval and Military
Committee do not consider Iceland a source
of danger. Consequently they have not
recommended works on the north - west
coast of Scotland.
House laughed, but a little hysterically.
It felt that with unerring military instinct
Mr. WEIR had put his finger on a weak
spot in the national armour; was only
half assured by the jaunty confidence of
UNDER SECRETARY FOB WAR.
The little incident appropriately led the
way to debate opened by SETON-KARR,
in which he demonstrated how thin is the I
crust of the crater on which the safety of
England rests. Showed how, war breaking
out, England would be beleaguered, would
in a week eat up all its bread stuffs, and
Famine would Stalk through the Land.
DILKE said there are peas and lentils.
True. Also there are old boots. But in no
case is the supply illimitable.
On the whole spent quite a cheerful
evening, Mr. WEIR frightening the life out
of us with prospect of an invasion from Ice-
land, and SETON-KARR, like the voice of
one crying in a granary, "We have no
corn." By eight o'clock everyone in such
a blue funk that we were glad to see each
other home before it got later.
Business done.—House counted out at
eight o'clock.
Thursday. — " TIM HEALY reminds me,"
said SARK, "of the waiter not unknown
to fame, who, having a rare holiday, spent
it in assisting a pal to serve a big dinner."
No Irish business to the fore just now.
Other Irish Members take advantage of
the lull, either to go back to their much-
loved country or spend the evening with
their friends in town. TIM, on the contrary,
hearing that the Welsh Members mean to
oppose the Berriew School Bill, tucks
his serviette under his arm, and goes to
spend the evening helping them. Quite
a brisk debate, having the additional charm
that very few knew what it was about.
Honest CAP'EN TOMMY BOWLES frankly
avowed that frame of mind as sufficient
reason why he should vote for Second
Reading. It would have served equally well
as logical reason for opposing the Bill.
But with the CAP'EN benevolence always
predominates. To gentle minds it is easier
to say "yes" than "no." So when the
SPEAKER put the question that the Bill be
read a second time, the CAP'EN answered
with a cheery "Ay, ay, Sir!"
This Berriew School Bill has from the
first succeeded in attracting exceptional
attention. Members recalled how, on the
night when PRINCE ARTHUR, shelving the
Vice-President of the Council, proposed to
introduce the Voluntary Schools Bill, JOHN
o' GORST adroitly nnd dramatically prefaced
the unusual procedure by humbly walking
un the floor, bringing in the Berriew
School Bill. Here it was come un for
Second Readme, with a pack of Welsh
Members in full cry, TRrcTLENT TIM
leading the way. Fought it step by step
on motion for Second Rending, and on
motion to refer it to Grand Committee on
Law. This last TIM denounced as "simnlv
an expedient for ramrodding the Bill
through the House."
I thank thee. TIM, for teaching me that
verb. Not to bp found in the dictionary;
but it ought to be.
77u.sinf.ss done.—Miscellaneous.
Friday. — Since CAWMELL-BANNERMAN
left War Office, we don't look to that part
of Pall Mall for wit and humour. But,
as SARK says, you may break, you may
shatter the vase as you will, the scent of
the roses will cling to it still. Thus,
though CAWMELL-BANNEHMAN was, nearly
two years ago, blown out of War Office by
cordite explosion, engineered by that great
military strategist ST. JOHN BRODRICK, the
building still gives forth echoes of good
things.
One such stands to credit of Financial
Secretary. In course of conversation across
the table, CALDWELL affirmed that some-
thing had been said by an earlier speaker.
"But," said POWELI, WILLIAMS, "the
hon. Member was not present at the
moment."
"Oh yes," said CALDWELL, '' I 'm always
here."
"Ah!" murmured POWELL WILLIAMS,
"but you 're not always there."

THE sweet old days of Long-ago
We thought could never, never change;
Our hearts were all too young to know
That they could ever, ever change,
My darling! O my darling!
When you were just a maiden coy,
\nd I was but a bashful boy,
When time was meant for endless joy—
Ah me! that we should find the change,
My darling! O my darling!
The promises of Spring were fain;
We thought that love could never change,
'Mid winds of March and April rain,
And so from Spring to Summer change,
My darling! O my darling!
The daffodils sprang into sheen
With gold encrowned upon the green;
Each one, like you, a gentle queen.
Ah me! that we should find the change,
My darling! O my darling!
The hopes of Spring are buried, fled
Into the life that yet must change;
Fhe love is lost, forgotten, dead
As memories that ever change,
My darling! O my darling!
No longer we meet now by stealth.
[ have my heart and you your wealth.
Upon my word I 'd drink your health—
Ah mo! if I could find the change,
My darling! O my darling!

[" There \» really no reason why we should not soon be ordering bottles of

Standard.}
DEAR SIR,—In submitting our new price-list for the ensuing
season, we beg once more to call your attention to the great
boon conferred upon the public by our system, which enables
persons of all classes, for very moderate charges, to have any
climate they prefer delivered in bottles or cases at their homes.
As the weather, unfortunately, seems likely to be less favour-
able during this summer than it was at the time of the last
Jubilee festivities, we are glad to say that we have in stock a
large quantity of superb Summer Temperature (very dry) laid
down in 1887. It is only necessary to open one of these bottles
in your hall, when your house will at once be filled with the
warm, glowing atmosphere of a sunny June day. As the de-
mand for this brand is likely to be very large, your orders for
this special "Queen's Weather" quality should be forwarded as
soon as possible.
We count with confidence upon doing a very large Summer
Holiday business this year. The well-known inconveniences
inseparable from travel, and the expense occasioned by the re-
moval of a large family to the seaside, can now be disregarded
entirely. You have but to send us an order to secure a cask of
guaranteed superfine sea-air, which can be opened in your own
home at any time you please. Should the requirements of differ-
ent members of your family demand it, you can fill one room
with Torquay air, another with the Scarborough brand, a third
with the peculiar atmosphere of a cheap foreign hotel (duly
impregnated with the customary microbes), and a fourth with
our special "Nansen " brand—a particularly bracing variety, im-
ported direct from the Arctic regions. The last-named may be
utilised with great advantage in the bedrooms of rich, elderly
relatives of asthmatic tendencies, and our bottled Malarial
Vapour (from the West Coast of Africa) is often used by lovers
seeking to dispose of an inconvenient rival.
It is scarcely necessary to point out how suitable a case or two
of selected atmospheres is for a present, especially when the
recipient is abroad. For this purpose we confidently recommend
our double-distilled Fog (London Particular). The unhappy
exile from England will indeed be delighted with such a gift, for
immediately he opens the bottle (which he will believe, from its
appearance^ to contain champagne) his house in the Riviera or
his log-cabin in America will at once be filled with the orange-
coloured, pungent atmosphere of the London fog which he has
missed so long, and he will readily imagine himself returned once
more to his beloved metropolis.
No class of the public values our system more than the artists,
poets, writers of time-tables, and others whose work is mainly
the product of their imaginations, which may be agreeably
stimulated by our Bottled Atmospheres. For instance, the poet
who lives in London, and desires to write an Ode to Summer on
a cold winter's day, can be supplied with a bottle of air collected
on a Devonshire farm in June, which (even if it gives him hay-
fever) cannot fail to place him thoroughly en rapport with his
theme. Similarly, the novelist who has never been out of Eng-
land, but prefers, in deference to public taste, to make Africa
the scene of his story, will succeed far more easily when he has
emptied a bottle of our very Old Sahara in his study. We also
are prepared to supply theatrical managers on special terms with
atmospheres from any part of the world, whereby the scenic
illusion will be very much enhanced.
For further particulars we beg to refer you to our price-list.
All atmospheres are most carefully bottled and packed, so that
a repetition of the recent accident (when a bottle or Double
Arctic burst in a train and froze the guard to death) is now
quite impossible.
Confidently awaiting your orders, which shall receive our most
prompt and careful attention,
We are, Dear Sir, Your obedient servants,
THE ATMOSPHERIC SUPPLY STORES, UNLIMITED.
THE MAN IN THE STREET.
THERE 'a a good bit o' chat, Mister Punch, abaout Me,
And a deal on it's kibosh and fiddle-de-dee.
There you are, Sir, that 'a strite I Lor I it do myke me grin
W hen the epouters and penny-a-liners begin
To trot out yours truly 1 Who spotted me fust,
With my love of a gawp and my stiddy old thust,
I am sure I carn't sy. But I meet my own nyme
All over the bill as a part o' the gyme.
Sort o' super, I s'pose, standin' by with a flag.
And a-quizzin1 the "Stars " who 're all straddle and brag,
And cop all the coin and the kudos. P'r'aps so!
Lookers-on do see most of the gyme, dontcherknow.
When you 're plying your part, with the foot-lights a-flare,
With daubed cheeks, toppin' togs and some pther cove's hair
t'nzzled up on your tibby, you're tempted, I s'pose,
To tyke yerself serous. A cockney's flat nose
Ruddled out to a Roman's with grease, paint and stuff
Mykes him feel like a swell though he may be a muff.
I ain't got no properties, bar a white 'at
Now and then in the summer, and shabby at that,
And my hair is my own, what there is of it left;
But at sizing things up, and a-tyking the heft
Of padded-out parties 'arf sordust and wool,
Well, I Ve larned a good bit as they don't teach at school.
The street 'as bin my only 'Varsity 1 Yus;
And for warming yer wits like there 's many a wuss.
What we do larn we know, and don't heasy forget;
Worked-out wisdom, washed down with a tankard o' wet,
And knowledge druv in like a nyle in a post,
By necessity's 'ammer 'a a fixture—with most.
Our "coach" is the grinstone, and if we don't "cram"
Like a goose, but feed heasy at large, like a lamb
In the still grassy springtime, I hold, Mister Punch,
Hasty stodge ain't a patch on deliberate munch.
Grub rushed is grub spiled! Rylewy travelers know that.
But the quill-driving lot don't know what they are at.
When they trot aput "The Man in the Street." Jimney whiz!
He must back their hideas, wich is mighty good biz
For their side or their argyment, better or wuss,
But for wich, very likely, he don't care a cuss!
I 'ave my own knowledge, likeways my own views,
But. a lot of the truck that they call "Art," and " news,"
/ call tommy-rot and stale fourpenny 1 Great Scott,
I 'm as ignerent as dirt of a thunderin' lot
Of their patter and pickters. Dunno what they mean,
And what's more I don't want to! The guffins are green
Who farcy I studdy aout all sorts o' stodge,
Abaout furrin flamfudge and perlitikle dodge,
'Igh Art and Harmenians, Rooshian and Greek,
Them two bloomin' mystries the Turk and "teckneek,
That bimetal fake, or why PAT is so queer
That he won't dodge the taxes by stickin' to beer!
Thev don't know me, pussonal, Punch, that is plain;
So I drop you a line, and may do so again;
For you '11 have the savvy to know when you meet

THE usually tranquil capital of peaceful
Belgium is in the throes of a revolution.
By some extraordinary censorship the news
has hitherto been kept from the English
newspapers. The Daily Chronicle has not
been aroused to fiery denunciation; even
M. DE BLOWITZ has remained silent. Yet
the fact cannot be denied. Our Extra
Special Correspondent, sent regardless of
expense (since he paid it himself) commu-
nicates to us the following exclusive and
astounding information by special post-
card. \Ve think that even any one as
parsimonious as he might have run to a
21d. letter, as, by aome treachery, the ex-
clusive information on his postcard might
have reached the Times or the Daily
Chronicle. Happily it did not, and this
morning we alone give to an astonished
world the first description of the Barri-
cades of Brussels. These are his words:
This city is in a condition of terrible
disorder. The Place Eoyale is occupied by
barricades and trenches, the Avenue
Louise, once the fashionable route to the
Bois de la Cambre, is impassable, and even
in front of the King's Palace all is in
confusion. The trenches are occupied by
determined men of the lowest classes,
armed with rough weapons, pick-axes, even
spades. The police are helpless; the army,
probably sympathising with the disturbers
of the peace, remains inactive. I myself
have been stopped I This final and culmi-
nating outrage took place yesterday in
broad daylight, as I was peacefully crossing
the Place Royale to reach my hotel. The
barricade was formed by an omnibus and
by a dog-cart (drawn by dogs) meeting on
the narrow bridge over the trenches. I
displayed a copy of the last issue of this
journal, but without effect. I, your Extra
Special Correspondent, was stopped! I can
write no more, partly because there is no
more room on this post-card. Up to the
present time I have heard nothing of com-
bined action on the part of the Great
Powers.
Later— by supplementary special post-card.
I forgot to say the trenches are for
the subterranean electric mechanism of the
Brussels tramways. The situation remains
unchanged. In the intervals of working,
between the hours of repose, three or four
men are going on slowly. It is hoped that
order will be re-established before the end
of the century.

"WHY, TEDDY DEAR, WHAT is THE MATTER? DON'T YOU LIKE
ASPARAGUS?"
"YEM, Mias BIRCHEM ; BUT THE HANDLES ARE so HOT!"
TO BE (MUZZLED) OS NOT, TOBY?
DEAR SIR AND HONOURED MASTER,
I write these few lines hoping you are having a holiday
as they leave me at present. I take advantage of the compara-
tive leisure to address you on the subject of dogs muzzled and
unmuzzled. I need hardly say that, personally, it does not
affect me. Like Mr. GLADSTONE after leaving Oxford I ;nu un-
muzzled. But I have a heart that can feel for another's woe.
Unspoiled by associations at Westminster I still, in off days,
dweu among my own people, know their feelings, and sympathise
with their aspirations.
What they—what we—want is, not to be free from the muz-
zling order. One of your poets has written about a dog who,
to serve his private ends, went mad and bit a man. That shows
how little we are understood. We desire to be delivered from
madness, and would patiently suffer inconvenience to attain that
end. What we object to is the absurd defect .of your legislation
which makes the muzzles peremptory in one parish and unneces-
sary in another. Somewhere or other in the counties or parishes
where the muzzle is imposed there conies a line touching the
boundary of a parish or county where there is no muzzle. On
one side is Freedom, and possibly Disease; on the other is
Slavery and Safety.
Apart from consideration for the wounded feelings of the
muazled dog looking across the street at the unmuzzled brother,
there is the danger of the unmuzzled dog biting his defenceless
neighbour, and, peradventure, imparting rabies. What I say is,
let there be one law and order throughout the kingdom. Let
all be muzzled or let all go free.
With much respect, Yours faithfully, TOBY.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THOUGH not as good as his Banishment of Jessop Blythe, and
not up to two or three other novels of his that most of us could
mention, yet, in The Dagger and the Cross, JOSEPH HATTON has
struck out for himself a new line, and, although it is a line I
would prefer to see struck out altogether, as being suggestive
of the Corelliesque scriptural romance and the Wilson-Bar-
rettian semi-sacred drama, yet is this book of his worthy of much
praise, and will certainly repay the reader if he be not in too
lightsome a humour, and can give the work the attention it de-
mands. JOSEPH HATTON'S health and work.
As one of the excellent series of " Little Novels" published by
FIBHEB UNWIN, CLARK RUSSELL'S A Noble Haul is a little novel
worth several ordinary big ones. It is a sailor's story, admirably
told, and in the smallest compass possible—quite a pocket com-
pass. For rail, road, or trip by sea, strongly recommended, as
enlivening and shortening the journey, by THE BAKON.
A PLEA FOR POOR-LAW OFFICERS.
(Dedicated to our Civic " Ouardlan" Angels.)
'Tis hard to call a civic gent a sinner
Because he's fond—who's not ?—of a good dinner.
The hand that has to wield Law's sword, or truncheon,
Needs strengthening—by a luxurious luncheon.
You can't expect bigwigs, at Bow or Button,
To keep their wisdom working on cold mutton.
Though paupers stoop to "skilly " or " cold scran "—well,
Their guardians at Homerton or Hanwell
Their strength must renovate, its loss recoup
On rump-steak pudding after ox-tail soup;
String up their nerves, by generous labour shaken,
On a not saddle, or roast fowls and bacon:
Shall not the guardian soothe his anguished heart
On Bakewell pudding or on rhubarb tart,
Or his dejected spirit strive to cheer
With limpid sherry or cool bitter beer?
Nay; grudge not poor-law patrons beef or wine I
Paupers must fast that guardians may dine.
THE RED, WHITE, AND BLUE.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—I was inspecting a quantity of ribbons to-
day, manufactured specially, so I was informed by the intelli-
gent and courteous haberdasher, for display on the occasion
of Her Majesty's Jubilee. As all of the fabrics in question were,
I noticed, made in France, Germany, and Switzerland, I was
not surprised to note that the combinations represented with
great accuracy the national Tricolors of the French Republic
and the Dutch Monarchy. Don't you think that some Union
Jack stuff would be more appropriate to this splendid anniver-
sary? And can't some of our own silk weavers turn out the
article P Or has the art of Spitalfields and Coventry been for
ever destroyed by the glorious era of Free Trade f
Yours loyally and patriotically,
Portsmouth. JOHN STARBOARD.
Holiday Wisdom.
(An Easter Homily.)
WHAT shall we do for a holiday task,
Just to ensure us a useful and jolly day?
Loll by the sea, in the sun idly bask:
Sand-heap for pillow, and kerchief for mask.
Lazily, drowsily, briar and flask
Ready at elbow when yearning shall ask
Peace from the pipe-bowl, and joy from the cask.
The best holiday task is—enjoying one's holiday!
At the New Restaurant.
Customer. Waiter! Bring me a beefsteak!
Waiter. Yessir. Would you like it stamped
Canada," or branded "Cut in South America?"
1 Made in
"As Seeing^ the Invisible."
WE hear a deal now of "invisible light,"
By which savans see through the opaque and the murky.
This surely must aid our SILOMIO'S sight,
Which sees "signs of improvement in Turkey " I!!

"THE CANDID FBIEND'S GUIDE."
THE courtesy of the learned author has enabled us to obtain
a brief glance at the proof sheets of this interesting work.
The author begins his labours, as all good authors ought to do,
with a great preiace, in which he is at much pains to trace the
Rise, Origin, and Progress of the Candid Friend.
Perhaps, however, the most interesting, and, from a meta-
physical point of view, valuable, portion of the Guide is the ad-
mirable collection of maxims, for the use of those who aspire to
become Candid Friends, with which our author terminates his
learned labours. We have space, and the author's permission,
to reproduce one or two of them.
Under the head of " Friends in Difficulties " we find the follow-
ing judicious maxim. "Ne/er encourage a friend in difficulty
to believe for an-instant that you have either the power or the
inclination to assist him, for if you do you will certainly ruin
him, and you, on your part, will forfeit all claim to the title of
Candid Friend. On the other hand, do not neglect the excellent
opportunity provided you by his misfortune to rebuke him severely
on the subject of his extravagance, rashness, want of principle,
or whatever the particular indiscretion may be that has caused
him to seek your assistance. Under no circumstances whatever
lend him any money."
The following admirable maxim will be found under the head
of "Conceited Friends." "People who are unreasonably happy
or prosperous stand sadly in need of the services of the Candid
Friend, who should do everything in his power to discourage
them. Perhaps the best way to do this is to talk dismally,
and to make the most melancholy grimaces whenever he meets
them. Should they, however, survive this spirited treatment,
the best thing the Candid Friend can do under these circum-
stances is, to 'cut' them."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A NAPPY THOUGHT AT THE
LYCEUM.
BUT was this idea of playing Nap an
appy thought" on the part of our HENRY
IIIVINU or not!' Did it show
or not!' Did it show our HENRY
very wide awake, or was he for once and
away "caught napping";1 Xliat is the
question,
That Miss ELLEN TERRY should be the
lite and soul of SARDOU'S and MOREAU 's
French play, Madame Hans-Gene, was
what any one conversant with the .hngli&Ji
stage would have expected. She is a
charming Madume Suns-Gene. Her
washer-woinau is not quite so vulgar as wao
that of Madame KK.IA.NK, and therefore our
English actress's portrayal of the character
is not so lile-hke, not bo "convincing," to
adopt the modern critical cant^word, as wao
the .French actress's impersonation of the
character. But it is ELLEN TEURY as
Madame Suns-Gene, and that, for mobt
play-goers, is enough.
That the play, not a particularly good
one to start with, loses in. this translation,
is evidenced not only by the adapter hav-
ing made the French washer-woman of
IVy^ talk London slang of 1«97, but also
by the absurdity of retaining the scene
wnere Napoleon and his sisters "urop iiuo
Corsican," when they are having a iaunly
squabble. This lapsus linyuce was natural
enough in the French play, but it is all
"sound and fury signifying nothing" in
this English version. It must be supposed
either tuat the common sense of the trans-
lating adapter, Mr. CAUU, was overruled,
or that he could not find it in his heart to
sacrifice to the exigencies of the English
stage what had been so taking a scone,
because so natural, with a French audience.
That Sir HENRY IRVING could ever have
imagined that the English public, perfectly
familiar with the face and figure rf NAPO-
LEON, would accept him as the counterpart
of "le petit caporal," is a proof that he
knows his public and has rightly gauged his
own popularity. HENRY IRVING is as like
NAPOLEON as he can be; and if NAPOLEON
wasn't like HENRY IRVING, so much the
worse for NAPOLEON. It is as simply im-
possible for him to give us in himself an
exact "living picture" of NAPOLEON, as it
would be for him to appear as the dwarf
Sir GEOFFREY HUDSON. All else is beside
the question. Napoleonic attitudes do not
make NAPOLEON; but the piece, which is
remarkable neither for striking novelty of
plot nor for brilliancy of dialogue, must
depend for its success mainly on public
curiosity to see how Sir HENRY IRVING con-
trives to reduce himself to physical Napo-
leonic proportions, and how delightful is
the Madame Sans-Gene of Miss ELLEN-
TERRY.
Mr. FRANK COOPER is good as the brusque
soldier Lefebvre, afterwards Due de Dant-
zig; and Mr. MACKINTOSH gives his own
idea of what Fouehe, the celebrated Minis-
ter of Police, might have been had he been
created by Mr. MACKINTOSH. For the stale
device of creaking the snuff-box lid as a
warning. Messrs. SARDOU and MORKAU are
indebted to the same " business" in Kolert
Macaire, whenever that accomplished
scoundrel wishes to hint to his accomplice,
Jacques Strop, that he had better be care-
ful. Surely this very unoriginal idea of
Messrs. SARDOU and MOREAU might have
been improved upon by the English
adapter.
Years age the present writer can call to
mind BENJAMIN WEBSTER assuming the
character of Napoleon in a piece called The
Pretty Girli of Stilberg. That was a mar-
vellous impersonation; but then BEN
WEBSTER, though a trifle too tall, had just
the very face For tho Emperor. His wig
with the notable lock of hair was perfect;
Sir HENRY'S wig does not remind one of
the best known portraits of NAPOLEON.

ONLY HALF A NAP,—HIS KBTTEE HALF.
Sir Henry as Napoleon reflects that if only he
could have worn
The familiar grey ovtrcoat and the well-known
cocked hat, and played the part sitting down,
how much more like he could have looked!
Perhaps the cleverest stage impersonation
of NAPOLEON (but it was only for a few
minutes) was when CHARLOTTE SAUNTERS
suddenly appeared as the great Emperor
confronting JOHNNIE CLARKE, who, as
Louis Napokon, exclaimed, "Oh, my pro-
phetic soul! my uncle!" in the last scene
of BYRON'S burlesque of The Lady of Lyons
at the Strand Theatre. Sir HENRY'S im-

personation may be courteously termed an
"ideal NAPOLEON."
If Sir HENRY IRVING is as pleased with
Mr. COMYNS CARH'S version of Madame
Sans-Gine as, in his first-night speech
before the curtain, he professed himself to
be, and as, of course, he must have been to
have produced it at all, then such a gra-
tuitous assurance from his own lips must
be good enough for the public, seeing that
"praise from Sir HUBERT STANLEY is appro-
bation indeed!" It would be well for
dramatic authors generally, whenever there
may be any doubt as to the author's share
in the success of a new play, were the
manager, following Sir HENRY'S example,
to step before the curtain, and courteously
but decidedly deprecate all criticism an-
tagonistic to the dramatist, by candidly
avowing his own entire satisfaction with
the new work, whatever might have been
its reception. For the production of any
piece the manager alone is responsible to
the public. Mr. CARK, representing Messrs.
SARDOU and MOREAU, is to be heartily con-
gratulated on having his work played by so
excellent a company, and having his praises
sung by so generous and loyal a manager;
and, as the play is splendidly put on the
stage, and as from first to last ELLEN TERRY
is seen at her brightest, Madame Sans-
Crene, with some judicious pruning, will
probably prove a considerable attraction

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EJTKACTF.D FROM THB DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Hnust of Commons, Monday, April 12.
—Principal business of to-day's meeting
was to arrange for Easter Holidays. Inci-
dentally there were somo speeches about
affaire in Crete; but actual business was
the adjournment over Easter. When
question about to be put, SAOB OP QUEEN
ANNE'S GATE moved amendment proposing
that instead of making holiday, Members
should remain at Westminster and keep
their eye on the Government. A grim sort
of joke, submitted with great gravity,
treated by SPEAKER with imperturbable
mien. His not to reason why. Here was
resolution moved by the Leader, that on
rising the House do adjourn till Monday,
26th of April. Another Member moved to
omit certain words. If amendment were
carried there would be no holidays for any-
body; House would, unless it further or-
dered, sit on Good Friday.
Nothing more nobly unselfish recentlv
performed on public stage. When the di-
vision was taken, it appeared that, tellers
included, there were fifty-one men who
held their country dearer than their own
delieht, a gallant half-hundred ready to
sacrifice a well-earned holidnv in order to
keep unwinking eye on Her Majesty's
Ministers. It was a forlorn hone. The
battle was lost before the first blow was
struck. But what of that? It is even pos-
sible that, had the SAGE and his faithful
fiftv been certain that in the Division
Lobbv they would have overcome, they
would have shrunk from the encounter.
Anyone could win who commanded a nu-
merical majority. For some brave hearts
the irresistible attraction lies in the
certainty of everwhelming defeat. Ro.
silently, doggedly, they nassed into the
lobbv, and were swamped by the Minis-
terial horde.
SARK savs it reminds him of a scene in
CoRNEn,LE's Horace, where Horncf, is la-
menting the disc-race he supposes has been
brought upon him bv the flight of his son
in combat with the Curiaces. "Que. vnnlirt-
rmm nii'H fit rnntre trnis?" asks Jvlif.
"Qn'il mouriit!" the old man pa-ssionatelr
exclaims. What could the SAOE and his
fearless fifty do against the more than two
hundred kept together bv the Whins p
They could have died ; and (of course usintr
tho word in a Parliamentary sense) so they
did. each one faced bv four.
It is true thev had their reward, for they
got their holiday in addition to havinr
nosed as ready to scorn deliehts nnd live
laborious days for their countrv. But that
was a mere accident of the situation, and
does not dim its heroism. Since the hun-
dred Members sitrned a memorial to the
King of GREECE bidding him keep on fio-ht-
ins. and then, getting into the family 'bus.
wfnt off to their several homes, no such
gallant deed has been done at Westminster.
Business done. — Adjourned for Easter

SPORTIVE SONGS.
An Officer crippled in action remindt a former
Partner of the Jubilee a/1887.
ONLY ten years since first we met!
A century it seems to me.
Can either of us e'er forget
That joyous time of Jubilee P
When you had only just come out,
Quite chicken-like from schoolroom shell,
And I was but a dreadful lout
Who deemed himself a London swell.
At Lady TWEEDLEDEE'S you sat
With such a mute, appealing glance,
Until—bis dot qui knte dat—
I nerved myself to crave a dance.
A pretty blush and bow, then dumb
With joint delight we whirled away.
A polka! Ah I its rum-ti-tum
Is throbbing in my head to-day!
You wore a robe of clinging white,
Such as a fairy queen might choose,
With lilies of the water sprite
And roses of the faintest hues.
Your gems were sapphires blue as sea,
That shone beside your dainty nose,
And pearls in coral shown to me
Whene'er I trod upon your toes.
And so we danced the season through,
As happy as young hearts could be;
Was I in love? I scarcely knew.
Were you in love P—well, not with me 1
I never dared to gauge your mind.
But distance now enchantment lends,
Perhaps you might have been more kind
Instead of being the best of friends.
And here "s another Jubilee,
And all the world is just as gay
As when there shone for you and me
That other sun of yesterday!
My dancing seems a wretched ghost
That haunts a cripple for his sins,
While you, I see by Thursday's Post,
Have just enriched the world with twins!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

FHEI LONDON POLICEMAN'S SUMMER COSTUME.
A POSSIBLE FUTURK DEVELOPMENT.
THAT CONCERT.
TALK about the Gordian Knot! Thai a tangle? Rubbish! rot 1
It was nothing to our general mix to-day.
A modern ALEXANDER would be looked on as a gander,
For you see "decisive .action" does not pay.
We Ve a "European Concert," and by Jove, if anyone 's hurt,
He must not cry out and so disturb the tutti.
For our mighty "Monday Pop," at the least excuse would stop,
And to keep it going's everyone's first duty,
For if the big drum burst, or the fiddle known as first
Were to break a string—a whisper slight might do it!—
All the players left and right would at once begin to fight,
And then, by Jingo, all the world would rue it.
"Go, lovely Peace 1" Oh, yes! Lovely Peace would go, I guess.
No, you mustn't stir or whisper, cough or jar,
And if there 's any "spoken " straight that Concert will be broken,
And then there 'd be a European Wxir!!!
Oh, Orpheus, when you- twangled not a wild beast growled or
wangled,
The Bear the couching Lion laid his head on;
But now it is the Brutes play the fiddles, fifes and flutes,
And if Orpheus interferes it's—Armageddon!
At Brighton.
Visitor. Why, Mrs. FLINTER, your lodgings are a pound a
week dearer than they were last year!
Mrs. F. Yes, Ma'am, but you see there's so many antiquari-
ums come down to inspect the ruins of the Chain Pier that we
don't know where to put "em!
TRULY NATIONAL!
(Prophetic Report of a Coming Council.)
"THERE seems to be no doubt," observed the General Com-
manding, "that the mission of the Volunteers has been entirely
misunderstood."
"With the greatest possible respect I beg to differ," returned
the Auxiliary C. O. "Our motto is defence, and not defiance."
"My good Sir," continued the Regular, "what earthly use
can you be protecting Putney or Paddington, instead of carry-
ing the war into the enemy's country? At this moment at such
a crisis you should be marching on the enemy's capital."
"Not at all," replied another Volunteer Colonel. "We are es-
sentially for home use. Let the foe tread our sacred soil and we take
the advice of the First Duke of WELLINGTON and 'rise up and at
'em.' That is our object, and no other."
"Well, then, you must wait until you have the chance. I am
aware that the Fleet is away off the coast of China, but as yet
we have not heard of an invasion."
"Of course not," said the Commanding Royal Engineer.
"How could we? Why. all the wires were cut at eight o'clock
this morning. I should have considered the matter serious were
it not that I know that schoolboys are thoughtless and mis-
chievous. No doubt the interruption of our communication is
due to a silly practical joke."
"Well, in the face of no further communication," returned
the General, "we will accept that as authentic. And now let us
continue the discussion."
"I do not see the use. With all due submission to the better
opinion of my superiors, I venture to declare, that as the Volun-
teers were established by Acts of Parliament we can do nothing
to alter their constitution, away from Westminster."
"I am afraid you are right," acquiesced the Regular, after a
few minutes of the deepest cogitation. "The military power is
subservient to the civil. This is regrettable at all times, but it is
especially lamentable just now, as the enemy is, so to speak, at
our gates."
"Beg pardon, Sir," interrupted an A.-D.-C., who had just
come to attention, "but the foe is a bit nearer than that. They
have taken the town and we are surrounded, and practically
prisoners."
"And they select this moment," indignantly exclaimed the
Volunteer, "when we are considering our organisation, to take
us unawares! It is unsoldierly, it is ungentlemanly, it is bad
form 1"
However, there was no more time for denunciations, as an
officer of the enemy appeared and demanded the swords of all
present.
"Gentlemen," said the now ex-Commander-in-Chief, when the
ceremony of disarming had been completed, "there is but one
other thing to do, and we will do it. We will adjourn the con-
sideration of the Volunteers until the next invasion."
And as this appeared to be sensible, the proposal was adopted
unanimously, but without enthusiasm.
EXPERIENCES OF A FBENOH PHANTOM.
(Extract from the Diary of a Ghost.)
Now I am really very comfortable. Crossed the Channel in a
gale and frightened none of the passengers. Fact was, some of
them were so feeble that they appeared quite pleased to sec
me. Now I am here in a very well appointed chdteau. If the
press will only leave me alone I shall get on nicely. I am jotting
down my notes in the library. . . A newspaper! Had a presenti-
ment I should find one. And of course, strange noises, knock-
ings—bell-ringing!" Yes, all that's meant for me! Thought
they wouldn't leave me alone for long! I suppose they consider
me "good copy" when the war news is scarce, and the last
murder is a fortnight old. Now a lot of idiots will follow me up
to discover what I am. Doctors, lawyers, and the rest of them.
Well, I had better make the most of my time. . . Got a. lot of
raps out of that panelling, and set the bells all over the house
"a-ringing for SARAH!" Great fun! . . . Thought it would be
so! There 's one of the lunatics taking a pot-shot at me with a
Kodak, and another attempting to riddle me with the contents
of a revolver! No peace nor quiet! Well, I suppose there's
nothing to be done—I must be off to England again! And rh!
I am so tired of ruined castles and the interiors of dried-up wells!

She. I can assure you that all we desire is suitable recognition.
He. But, really, a degree is useless. Nearly all the p-ofessions
are closed (and I think properly) to the weaker sex.
She. You forget we are permitted to dabble a little in medicine.
He. But really under protest.
She. Still, a degree would give a woman a certificate of having
attained a certain educational standard.
He. But, my dear madam, you would never be satisfied with
that. You would require a voice in the government of our
ancient institutions.
She. Pardon me, but you suggest an impossibility. It has
always been admitted that woman has been the weaker sex.
He (smiling). In theory! [The concession is granted.
THE FUTURE.—The Position as before.
He. Pray take my word for it, that all we ask is to be granted
suitable recognition.
She. You must admit that a degree for men in these days is
absolutely valueless. All the professions (with scarcely an ex-
ception) are filled (and rightly filled) by the stronger sex.
He. You forget that the clergy are still of the masculine
gender.
She. But our foremost feminine thinkers regard the reservation
with distaste.
He. Then think of the social value of a degree to a man. It
would be a proof that he had a mind above rounders, and lawn-
tennis.
She. But, my dear Sir, a man once writing B.A. after his name
would never be satisfied with that. It would be the thin end of
the wedge. He would next be asking to have a voice in the
government of our ancient institutions.
He. Pray let me correct you. I can assure you that you speak
of a ridiculous impossibility. It has ever been found that man
has been the weaker sex.
She (smiling). In fact! [The concession is refused.

AUGUSTE EN ANGLETERRE.
LONDON.
DEAR MISTER,—Having encountered there is some time one of
the deputies, I have seized the occasion of to visit the Palace
of the Parliament. One afternoon I go there, and following the
instructions of the brave policemans 1 arrive to a great octagon
hall, where 1 give my card of visit to another policeman—
partout des policemans!—who indicates to me that I must rest
at the end of a range of persons at side of the entry. I attend
there patiently while that a fat policeman marches of long in
large, de long en large, almost on our foots. C'est ennuyant. I
attend as that during one half hour. Of time in time a huissier
comes to the entry and cries a name, but never the name of the
deputy whom I desire to visit, ni IK mien non plus, nor the mine
not more. C'est tres, tres-fatigant.
At the moment where I go to ask if I may to seat myself on
the pavement of the hall, I near a hurling, un hurlement, at the
entry. It are the policemans and the huissier who call. The
hall resounds of the cry "Bessmpiah." In fine I comprehend
that it is my name, BASSOMPIERRE, pronounced at the English
mode. Enfin! I disengage myself from the other persons, and
I go at rapid step to the entry where I find the deputy. 1 shall
call him Bar. X.
He receives me very politely and conducts me around of the
rooms of the fashion the most amiable. At first we enter
in the "Lobby," and from there we pass in a couloir, as sombre
as the corridors of the Palace of Justice. Toujours the gothic
style, but of another epoch. If they love the gothic style, the
English, and that in a climate so sad, so black I We arrest our-
selves at the glassed door of a quite little room, where I per-
ceive some men reading some journals. Evidemment vne petite
salle d'attente des huissiers, on des agents de la police de surete,
that which you call "detectors." But no! Mister X. says to
me that this little room, enough sad and enough sombre, is the
cabinet de lecture of the deputies themselves, the "Newspaper
Room" of the most great, or at the least of the most ancient,
of the parliaments of the world. What droll of idea I
And of morel There is not there one sole stranger journal,
un seul journal Stranger. In vain the brave journalists of Paris
discuss the question of Egypt, in vain the most violent of the
german writers say thousand injuries, mille injwres, to your
country, your deputies can only read all that translated and
compressed in the english journals. And of more! There is
there but one sole illustrated journal. It is true that, among
all, the deputies have chosen the most respectable, the most
illustrious, that magnificent journal, of which I am, dear Mister
Punchj the collaborateur the most humble and the most indig-
nant, indigne. But the others in your country—the Illustrated
Graphic, the Black and Slue, the Policemans News—they ap-
pear never in this little room.
Then we arrive to some other little rooms, encore plus mes-
quines et pliia mornes, where the deputies can to invite their
friends to dine. Mister X. cflibataire, who has perhaps forty
years, or less, complains himself much of these rooms so
"shahby." He desires to invite some ladies and some misters
of his friends, and he must to receive them in a salle-a-manger

invites to the fivoclock I It is terrible. The other deputies are
perhaps more aged, and the beautiful misses come not to render
visit to them. But Mister X., truly I pity him! However, in

country—Mister X. can to receive these ladies on the terrace
which gives on the Thames. That must to be very agreeable. I

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Le Morte Darthur, by Sir THOJIAS MALORY, Part Third. A
new volume. The series to which this belongs, published by
J. M. DENT & Co., Aldine House, is the daintiest, handsomest,
an! handiest, ever as yet issued by any publishing house. Port-
able gems every one of them.
I do not remember ever having read any work by EDEN PHIL-
POTTS previous to his Lying Prophets, published by INNES & Co.,
but if his others are equal to this his latest, then is there in store
for me. quoth the Baron, a great treat, for a more masterly
novel, both for analysis of character, exact reproduction of local
dialect, poetic appreciation of scenery, and sustained interest
in the events of a very simple and probable story, it would
be difficult to find. Where THACKERAY, supposing be had
chosen such a theme, would have assumed the showman and
would have stopped to moralise on the action of his puppets,
Mr. KHEN PHILPOTTS, 011 almost all occasions save two or three,
continues his story as a narrator, and does not distract the
attention of the reader at the risk of wearying him by becoming
an apologist for each action of the beings of his own creation.
Nor does he fill pages with sordid unnecessary details, as does
ZOLA, though he fearlessly calls a spade a spade, when thereto
compelled by the necessity of the case. It is a pathetic tragedy
of homely and very real life, and if we would have had it end
otherwise than it has seemed good to the author to end it, it is
because, while reading, we have come to love, pity, or sym-
pathise with, the principal characters in the story.

The while it lasted, darling;
Some day the joke we may repeat

When I cried, "We must do or die I "—

And so you joined me in the Square,
Where with the cab I waited;
I made the crossing-sweeper stare,
With proof of being elated I
Then merrily, I think you '11 say,
We did a round of shopping,
It seemed a kind of business day,
When I did all the stopping.
And thus at length with such a bunch
Of springtide buds and blossoms,

To charm and to subdue alike—
To bring back her repentant lover,
And fire his bosom—is to "bike."

Landlord (who has been listening to his Tenant's grumbles). "WELL, SMITHERS, YOU MUST ADMIT YOU'VE HAD GOOD LFCK WITH
THE LAMBS."
Tenant. "UMPH! THERE ABE Too MANY BY HALF. LOOK \VHAT A SIGHT OF MONEY THEY 'LL COST TO BEAR!"
THE PHANTOM VEHICLE.
THB youth was almost crazy with excitement. It had been a
sad disappointment to have been absent from the great meet
which had taken place while he was abroad. He had longed to
join in the shout of enthusiastic exultation that had greeted the
commencement of the movement that practically was to revolu-
tionise the universe. He had read eagerly the newspapers teem-
ing with descriptions and prospectuses, and then had travelled
post-haste from the Antipodes to his native land.
"It is a great thing for the nineteenth century!" he exclaimed.
"It would have been a thousand pities had the honour been
delayed until the twentieth could nave claimed the distinction.
But now to work 1 I must see them with my own eyes! Oh, the
joy, the triumph of it!"
He hastily left his house. He expected to meet the object of
his search outside his door. But it was not there.
"Ah!" he said to himself, "I shall find them in the busy
streets, in the public places, where the men of commerce most do
congregate."
But again he was disappointed. His quest was fruitless in the
Strand, Fleet Street, Oxford Circus, the Poultry, and Cornhill.
"How absurd 1" he murmured. "Of course, they are in the
suburbs. Greater London is the place for them. It will be time
when Brixton and Tooting are occupied for Lombard Street to
be invaded."
But a visit to the delightful localities to which he had referred
yielded no results. He was equally unsuccessful in Kensington,
Richmond, Putney, Chiswick, and Wimbledon.
"Ah, the parks! I shall find them in the parks!"
But he did not. Hampton Court was free, and so were the
graceful grounds adjacent to the Albert Memorial.
"The provinces are always in advance of the metropolis," he
thought. "I will go farther afield."
Then ha remounted his bicycle. He journeyed to Westward
Ho; he sped to Birmingham. He was found in Chester, Scar-
borough, Cardiff, Stoke, Oxford, Cambridge, and Crewe Junction.
And the result was ever the same. Nothing to be seen. They
were nowhere.
He had grown prematurely old. He was dispirited. But still
he would have continued his examination had not fatigue bade
him halt. At last he fainted. When he recovered he told his
story.
"But what have you been looking for?" asked the doctor.
Then came the reply which showed how hopeless had been his
perambulatory investigation from the first. He murmured, with
a deep sigh, "I have been searching for a motor-car!"
"But you have not found one ?" queried the medical man.
"I have not."
"No more has anyone else," returned the disciple of ,3<!sou-
lapius. And the statement had the admirable accuracy of
scientific research.
PROVERBS FROM THE PLAY.
You may fill a comedy with tons of talk, but that won't give
it a plot.
A line after a time freshens up nine hundred and ninety-nine.
A woman may be called, on the stage, trente-six, but that
won't make her appear older than twenty in her dressing-room.
Look after the stalls and boxes and the pit and gallery will
take care of themselves.
A hiss is not so good as a smile.
A notice that is one man's bread may be another man's poison.
If silence before the curtain is silver, signed letters in the
newspapers are golden.
Scotland for Ever!
"WHY," asked the old customer of the MACTAVISH, "have you
changed the name of this apartment from the Milton, to the
Burns Room?"
"Frae puir patriotism," replied the Laird. "'Deed, mon,
wherefore shouldna one blind poet take the place o' anither?
Ye 'd no be wanting me to name the chamber the Wilfrid
Lawson?"

VIVE LA POLITESSE! LADIES FIRST!
DARBY JONES ON THE CITY AND
SUBURBAN.
HONOURED SIR, — I feel assured that,
during the visit of the eminent Dr. NANSEN
to this country, he must have left a speci-
men of the North Pole in the keeping of
the Royal Geographical Society, or some
other influential body, for never do I re-
member the Newmarket Craven Meeting
to have been so afflicted with that chilli-
ness, which is more suited to Mr. HARRY
DE WINDT on the bleak shores of Behring's
Straits, or Mr. JACKSON amid the none too
congenial surroundings of Franz Josef
Land, than to yours truly in the vicinity
of the famous Ditch, to which we invari-
ably raise the chimney-pot or bowler of
commerce and conventionality. The vic-
tory of the Prince of WALES with Moasme
on Thursday, however, threw a little
warmth into the meeting; and will Mr.
HAWKE and the Anti-Gambling League be
down on H.R.H. when I state that he had
a bit on his pretty child of St. Simnn?
(N.B.—I never knew a race-horse yet with-
out a bit on it when running. Twiggez
vau.1, honoured Sir ?)
In the meantime, what do Mr. H. and
the Aggravated-Grandmother League
want? If they imagine victory assured
because a few bookmakers and their gen-
teel pencillers are convicted, they err as
lamentably as did Mrs. PARTINGTON when
battling the Atlantic Ocean with her mop.
fake the word, Sir, of an old and white-
whiskered pard. You might construct the
Channel Tunnel or travel to Pekin in an
aeronautical vessel, but, if we were Medes
and Persians, the laws couldn't prevent us
from imperilling our paper, gold, silver or
bronze in the Game of Speculation. And
if Mr. H. and the Aggravated Grand-
mothers drive us off the Turf in England,
you may rest assured that, like Irish sham-
rocks, we shall rise up again somewhere
else, be it on the broad plains of Thessaly,
where gate-money meetings would be of
immense advantage to King GEORGE ot
Greece, or on the gentle sward which, I
am told, environs the great and salubrious
lakes of Africa.
But, yam satis, as the poet said when he
had finished the pot of marmalade. Let
me turn my lighthouse eye on the troubled
sea of the City and Sub—a name which, in
this abbreviated form, rhymes nicely with
"pub," and Bacchus and that German
beer-swiller, Gambrinus, know that the
Licensed Victuallers not only flock to Ep-
som on the occasion of this London-cum-
Clapham and Tooting contest, but are
always accompanied by a Birnam Flower
Garden of Licensed Victualleressee, ma-
trons and maids, dames and damsels,
ladies and lasses, relieved for the nonce
from the strain of the beer-engine and the

those of Lady Clara Vere dt, Vere, but

And now to business. Let me mount
Pegasus with the hope, Sir, that you, and
the Princes and Nobles with whom you
coniort, have your silken handkerchiefs so
well tasselled that you will be able to place
a goodly number of shekels on the selec-

Ancient Order of Starters Belief—of your
true friend and faithful adviser. So here

And M'lJ'ij in the one, two, three.
There, honoured Sir, is the little pro-
gramme laid out as neatly as Lieutenant
DAN GODFREY was wont to arrange his
melodious selections for the Trooping of
the Colour. Knowing that you are some-
what chary under the Hawke-Hawkins de-
cision of risking your revered self within
the precincts of a Place, I take leave to
tell you that, in partnership with my
friend, Captain PHILIP QUISBY, I have
chartered a coach, which will be found on

downs"), where business can be done writh
the utmost secrecy and despatch.
Ever your devoted helot,

WE ARE SIX.
A Wordsworthian Fragment.
I MET a little Concert chap,
He was one of Six, he said;
His hair was thick, but, by strange hap,
Less thick than was his head.
He had a simple stolid air,
And he was quaintly clad.
He said, "I 'm here to see all fair!"—
His folly made me mad.
"Your co-performers, wooden-head,
How many may you be?"
"How many? Six in all," he said,
And wondering looked at me.
"And what's your game? I pray you
tell I"
He answered, "Six are we;
Young CURZON is an awful swell;
Our ships are on the sea."
"If CURZON is an awful swell,
If ships are on the sea,
What mean the Six? I pray you tell
What your joint game may be."
Then did the little chap reply,
"Six Mighty Powers are we,
And Three of us—well, we stand by,
And watch the other Three!
"And of the latter Three there's One
Who seems in a queer fix;
The other pair, they boss the fun.
Ah! we're a Mighty Six!!!"
"If Three are mute, or dead," I said,
"And One is in a fix,
You're practically Two!" But still
That Concert cove would have his will,
And said, "Nay, we are Six!! 1"
Honours Divided.
(Tlwught on Transactions in the Transvaal.)
To open people's eyes one man desires,
Another's special business is to shut
them;
One politician has to pull the wires,
Another has to—cut them!
It all depends—sure nothing could be
clearer—
If you are in Mafeking or Madeira!

HONOURED SIK,—I can well understand
that you, with other honoured patrons,
were not altogether pleased with my
diagnosis of the City pnd Suburban
Handicap. Nevertheless, remember that
I failed not to point out the tran-
scendent merits of the Winner and
of braw Boy Ronald, the while my out-
sider, Amandier, ran a dead heat for
fourth place. You will observe, too, that
I utterly disregarded the claims of such
crass pretenders as Crestfallen and South
Australian. The latter should be set aside
as a mount for one of the gallant Antipo-
dean Brigade, which has arrived to honour
the Diamond Commemoration Day.
"After Epsom, Sandown!" the racing
folk cried, just as the magnificent Louis
QUINZB, King of France, Navarre, and
other minor countries, invoked the deluge.
Personally I do not appreciate Sandown,
especially in very showery or very hot
weather, when the toil from the station
reminds one of the excursion of LONG-
FELLOW'S hero in that abstruse poem, "Ex-
celsior." "Sand up! " not Sundown, ought
to be the cry, while ascending that incon-
venient mount abutting on the most acci-
dental course in Great Britain.
Let us rather to Newmarket. Have you,
honoured Sir, ever seen, as I have, the
ever-sportsmanlike Heir-Apparent canter-
ing over the classic Heath on his cob at
nine o'clock in the morning, and surveying
with a critical eye the "strings" about
which there is no "roping"? I trow not.
Newmarket is indeed a glorious place, and
that H.R.H. should forsake his well-earned
feather bed in order to examine the tips
and Downs of Racing, does not astonish
yours truly.
The Two Thousand Guineas Race has not
that importance which it held of yore, but
among these latter-day saints of the Racing
Calends, we must still remember such
heroes as Surefoot, Common, Isinglass,
Kirk Connell, and St. Frusquin. It used
to be held as a Dress Rehearsal for the
Derby Drama; it is now only the Pre-
liminary Farce. Nevertheless, it commands
the same respect which we bestow on the
Acropolis of Athens, the Pyramids of
Egypt, and St. Paul's Cathedral, because
it smacks of remains. The Bard therefore
dedicates thess few lines to the object of
a subject, which once aroused an interest
second only after the event to Nunhead
Cemetery. The Augur (mark his words)
says: —
This used to be a race, but now
It seem* to be a *»•). of promenade;
For tv'ry mare'» apparently a cow,
And ev'ry horse unfit to meet a jade.
The Irishman, they §ay, will " funk " the task,
The Royal Flunkey's chances are much fainter,
The Channel Islands won't do what they atk,
So I must choose the Primrose Spanifh Painter.
But don't forget, with women aa with mm,
A Bard may chant, "There's someone on the

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The Thackeray* in India (HENRY FROWDE), purports to be an
account of the history of the family and connections of the
great novelist. That purpose is fully accomplished. But beyond
it Sir WILLIAM HUNTER, in a volume of less than two hundred
pages, manages, with perhaps unconscious art, to give a picture
of India in John Company's time, full of light and colour. His
first chapter, "Some Calcutta Graves," conveys a more vivid
impression of the birth of our Empire in India, and of the
personalities of the men who brought it about, than some much
larger tomes my Baronite has read through. The THACKERAYS
Sir WILLIAM HUNTER follows in patient, loving quest from the
first WILLIAM MAKEPEACE, who, in 1776, went out as a covenanted
civilian in the service of the East India Company, down to the
last and more illustrious, born in Calcutta on the 18th of July,
1811. Four sons of the first W. M. T., and fourteen of his
descendants and kinsmen, served John Company. In the novel-
ist's grand-uncle and guardian, PETER MOORE, is disclosed the
lay figure which THACKERAY later clothed with the simple virtues
and noble dignity of Colonel Newcome. Though ruined himself,
cast down as Colonel Newcome was from a position of wealth and
ease to one of poverty, PETER MOORE so well served his little
ward, that when in 1832 THACKERAY came of age, he found him-
self in possession of £20,000. The book is fascinating from first
page to last. It is worth more than it costs simply for this
glimpse of Colonel Newcome in the flesh.
"I do not speak well your beautiful language, but I admire
him," said, apologetically to a Frenchman, a certain distinguished
English artist wno loved to be mistaken by strangers for a
foreigner. So quoth the Baron to the bicyclist, I do not
myself 'wheel,' out I admire him," and, on the "hit muni nihil
alienum" principle, nothing that interests so vast a majority of
Englishmen and Englishwomen can possibly be foreign to the
large-hearted Baron. With pleasure, then, has he considered
the pages of The Complete Cyclist, which is No. 2 of the Isthmian
Library, published by INNES & Co., of Bedford Street. The
Baron does not know who the " Co." in this firm may be, but how
apposite for the publishers of any guide-book showing bicyclists
and others where to go, and at what hotels to stay, would be the
name of "Innes and Outs." Curious to note, that at first a bicy-
clist was called "a cad on castors." Not a few caddish bicyclists
there are, unfortunately, like the poor, "always with us," and many
a lady and gentleman wheeler has had to suffer for coming into
collision with these 'AHUIKS of the wheel. In this book there are
several very amusing stories, one of the best being the story of
"The Duck and the Wheel." which sounds as if it were part of
a menu. The "Scorcher is ridiculed and denounced. Ap-
parently every fair " bicycliste" must be a bigamist, as she can-
not get along without a couple of "hubs." Decidedly an
amusing, and, at the same time, to all "leaders" of the bicycling
fashion, and to all "wheelers," an interesting and useful volume.

A KEW-EIOUS PROPOSAL.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—Seeing that considerable difficulty is being
experienced by the Court officials in finding sufficient accommo-
dation for the guests of HER MAJESTY dunng the Commemora-
tion Festivities, I venture to suggest that the Representative
of the Emperor of CHINA might be very comfortably housed in
the Pagoda of Kew Gardens, which is at present, as useless as
when it was erected, and denied to the public. It consists of
nine stories and a basement, and no doubt could easily be con-
verted into Celestial flats, with, let us say, a Jubilee lift. More-
over, Kew Gardens are celebrated for birds' nests, wherewithal
to provide the necessary soup, and I can guarantee plenty of
nightingales. Trusting that you will bring my idea to the notice
of Sir SPBNCBR PONSONBT-FANE, or someone equally versed in
the vicissitudes of Box and Cox,—I am, yours expectantly,
W Mow-Pattern Lodge, Iskworth. CAPBIOOBNTJS JUNKET.
"TANT.F..NR ANIMIS SEASIDIBUS IB^E I " — Judging from the

Mayor, Corporation, and towns-folk of that salubrious seaside
resort. The Mayor represents, in himself, the Head and the
Hart of the town.

DOING THE TOWER.
It is a dull and chilly afternoon. Tlie crowd of Sightseers is large and
miscellaneous; amongst them may be mentioned (1) a Matron from
the Mile End Road, addressed as "Mrs. Edkins, Mum," whose
hilarioumess expresses itself in the form of persiflage; with her, a
bevy of factory girls, by whom her humour is keenly appreciated.
(2) A Person with a talent for impromptu platitude which almost
amounts to genius; with him, an adult nephew, who has the highly
irritating peculiarity of never being at hand when addressed. (3) A
tall Sergeant in the Guards, with his '' young woman" and her
married sister. (4) A wheezy and hnsky old Lady, with an admiring
country friend. (5) A Languid Man, with two bored Ladies, and
(6) Our inevitable acquaintance, the Comic Cockney.
IN TBE REGALIA KOOM.
Mrs. Edkins. That's 'ER MAJESTY'S best crownd, that is. I
wonder if she 'd let me 'ave the loan of it some Sunday. I should
look nice goin' down to Eppin' Forest with that on my 'ed!
First Factory Girl. Lorluvyer, Mrs. EDKINS, mum, a top'eavy
concern like that wouldn' stay long on your 'ed.
Mrs. Edkins. Oh, I dunno. With a couple o' 'at-pins!
The Sergeant's Young Woman (shrewdly). The Royal Family
seems partial to salt, from the number and size of the salt-
cellars they Ve got here!
The Sergeant. That's natural enough, being, as you may say,
the salt of the earth themselves. In this case over here, you
see (with an air of proprietorship), we keep the Swords of State 1
His Companions (with awestruck reverence). What whoppers!
The Platitudinarian (to his Nephew). By a striking and beau-
tiful allegory, the precise origin of which is lost in obscurity, the
Sword of Mercy—though forty inches long—is entirely lacking
in point.
The Comic Cockney (whom, owing to the gloom, he has addressed
by mistake). You don't s'y so, Mister. Well, I've 'eard remarks
since I come in 'ere as kin tike the shoine outer the Sword o'

The Comic Cockney (to his Companion). J'ever 'ear me purtend
to be a kid? Jest you listen, then. (Approaches Warder on

a stage-infant.) P'ease, Misser Beefeater, I wants my ticket
pun'sed.

IN THE CHAPEL OF ST. JOHN.
The Platitudinarian (to his Nephew). Strange to think that
these very arches must have frequently witnessed the devotions
of WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR and his family! How it thrills one
with the consciousness of our close kinship with the past. Don't
you feel that?

ness, modestly). Why, you see, Sir, not bein' related to the

that nephew of mine will lag behind like this. No, he's on
ahead, in the Armoury. What good he expects to get by coming
here if he doesn't keep with me, I don't
[He follows in pursuit.
IN THE BANQUETING HALL.
The Sergeant's Young Woman. I like the way they 've done
the walls and ceilings, all in patterns with swords. So out of the
common.
The Sergeant (gratified). Yes, it's tasty. But you come along
and I '11 show you a trophy of Injian corn and a bird pursooin'
a butterfly, all made out of old bayonets and ramrods and gun-
locks. •
His Young Woman. What! a bird and a butterfly made out
of bayonets! Well, you 'owe got some novelties 'ere, I must say!
First Factory Girl. 'Ullo, there 's ole Queen ELIZABETH on the
'orse, d'yer see ? and that's her page-boy 'olding of it.
Second Factory Girl (reading placard). "As she appeared on
her way to St. Paul's to return thanks for the Destruction of
the Spanish Armada." Well, she ain't dressed not what I call
smart, would you, Mrs. EDKINS, mum?
Mrs. Edkins. I wouldn' be seen so shabby myself. Still
(indulgently), ahe'd be nicelookin' enough, if it wasn't for
her lice.
IN THE COUNCIL CHAMBER.
First Bored Lady. It really is rather worth seeing, don't you
think. I 'm quite glad we came.
Second Bored Lady. Yes, all these old knights in armour are
rather dears. (Checking a yawn.) Only there are so many of
them!
The Languid Man. They 're distinctly not bad. And they Ve
got some tolerable things here. Here's the old beheading-
axe, you see, and the block Lord LOVAT was executed on.
First Bored Lady. I think they 're quite horrible. (Sleepily.)
It makes me feel perfectly creepy to look at them.
Second Bored Lady (checking another yawn). But rather in-
teresting. You can see the marks of the axe on the block
quite plainly.
First Bored Lady. 1 don't see the use of preserving such
horrid things—they only spoil one's tea.
The Platitudinarian (once more addressing his elusive Nephew).
The executioner's axe t A sinister-looking implement indeed.
How many noble and promising careers nave been cut short
by that grim hatchet!
The Bystander (a complete stranger, but sympathetic). Yei
right, Guv'ner, it's took the crumpets orf of a good few blokes
in its toime, ain't it?
[The Platitudinarian moves away in wrathful discomfiture.
The Wheezy Old Lady (to her friend, as they inspect a mounted
effigy in tilting-armour). You see, my dear, you see, this was
when they 'ad 'and to 'and fighting, whereas now, you see, they
fight a 'undred miles away from one another, which is very

In one long streaming veil.

That has not found its Morn.

CONVERSATIONAL PITFALLS.
Tert:e Spiller (to ifiss Wilsm, an liottl acquaintance). "OH, YES, MOTHER ANU I ARK TROTTING ROUND TOGETHER. BUT DON'T YOU
FIND TRAVELLING ALONE RATHER'.DULL 1" AflSS Wilson. "Nor ALTOGETHER."
Bertie Spillr.r. "AH, I IXPECT YOU 'RE ONE OF THOSE WHO DON'T CARE FOR ANYBODY—AND NOBODY CARES FOR YOU!"
AT BURLINGTON HOUSE.
THIS, the One Hundred and Twenty-ninth Royal Academy
Exhibition, will be memorable as the first under the Presidency
of Sir EDWARD J. POYNTER. "that's an 'at without an 'ead?"
wrote a very ancient author of burlesque, and, a propo.? of Sir
EDWARD, an 'ARRY may ask, "What's a Nacademy without a
NED P" Sir EDWIN LANDSEER would have rejoiced could he have
foreseen that a POYNTER would take the Presidential chair at
the Council of "clever does," all Royal Academicians. Con-
spicuous this year among "The Elect" are the works of JOHN
SINGER SARGENT—a Sargent worthy to be a Colonel, a Singer
to be reckoned among; the Great Tone Poets.
No. 76. JOHN MACWHIRTER, R.A., gives us "Affric Water,
looking up." This eminent artist should be at once engaged by
the Amalgamated Apollinaris and Johannis Co., to illustrate the
shares in these two waters "looking up.
No. 77. BRITON RIVIERE, R.A., instead of such a subject as
Una and the Lion, presents us to A Lady and a Donkey. The
lady has just alighted, and the donkey shows no signs of moving.
"'If,'" quotes the lady to herself, '"I had a donkey what
wouldn't go, Would I wallop him? Oh, dear no!' But I 'd dress
him up in bright ribands, put a leopard's skin on his back—just
to remind him of the old ^Esopian fable—and, whatever might
b« said as to his obstinacy, I would stand by him to the last—
that is, while my portrait was being painted."
No. 84. Portrait of an unfortunate young gentleman, who is
looking very serious, and enough to make him, as he is so leaning
to the left that it is evident he has lost hii balance, and has hardly
anything to support him. This is by W. W. OULEHS, R.A.
HUBERT HERKOMER, R.A., has done a goodly number of por-
traits, but his gem is in the Sculpture Gallery, No. 2052, "The
Presidential "Badge of the Royal Society of Painters in Water
Colours," which no lover of art should fail to see, whatever else
be may not have time for in this Academy. In this room, too,
note George. Alexander—bust" (absit omen! but GEORGE ALEX-
ANDER is a theatrical manager), by ONSLOW FORD, R.A.; also a
life-like bust of Sir Richard Quoin, M.D., F.R.S., Most Ex-
traordinary Physician, Ac., Ac., by THOMAS BROCK, not the fire-
work maker, but the Royal Academician. GEORGE FRAMPTON'S
Dame Alice Owen is so marvellously life-like that the awed spec-
tator is fully prepared to see it move its head, lift its stick, and
perhaps step down and ask for a catalogue.
Look at No. 2053, female figure, which, like the lady at the
Derby that wouldn't bet, "has nothing on," and is holding a
scimitar in a most dangerous position. It is called Salome
('ARRY will read it out as "Sal Ome"), and is the work of Mr.
BERTRAM MACKENNAL.
No. 2024. Pope lao 117J., P.M. Signor RAFFAELU
NANNINI represents his Holiness in the most smiling mood.
Probably after mid-day refection. Had it been "A.M." instead
of "P.M.," the expression might have been less genial.
No. 1001. Calm in the Channel. Delightful little picture.
Might have been aptly called, " Where all is Slue." There is no
shore visible, except in the name of the artist, J. RICHARD
BAOSHAWB, a grandson of that great marine painter, CLARESON
STANFIBLD.
No. 453. Special correspondents a hundred years ago, asking
for information during an Egyptian campaign. W. C. HORSLEY.
No. 445. Temptation of St. Anthony (for the thousandth time).
The Saint not to be tempted by any amount of "monkeys" (no
"ponies" were offered), cannot be attracted by a study from
the nude, or a mere bare idea, as suggested by JOHN C. DOLLMAN.
*»* Some of the demon monkeys worthy of a Walpurgis night.
No. 558. Quite an ideal master of hounds. Where did he get
his hunting breeches and topless boots made? Hounds apparently
stuffed with rotton-wool. Painted by CHARLES WT. FURSE. Quite
a "four de Furse."
No. 680. "There's a picture for you!" Tableau Vivant]
No one must leave the Academy without studying the picture,
and thanking the Hanging Committee. It is called "A Trial for
Bigamy," by EYRE CROWE, A.R.A. Pity it cannot be bought for
an automatic show, where you "put in a penny and the figures
will work."
No. 278. Congratulations to GEORGE H. BOUGHTON, R.A. He
paints "according to his lights," and the effect of these torches is
excellent.
Our artist has shown how admirably JOHN S. SARGENT has
depicted Mrs. Carl Meyer and Children—quite the portrait
picture of the year—on a sliding scale, a sort of drawing-room
tobogganing exercise.
SUMMARY.—Academy exhibition, on the whole, not up to the
highest oil and water mark.
EVIDENTLY TRUE.—What Sir E. MONSON said as he sailed
away: "There's a large heart in this Brest."

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIAKY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, April 26.
—Something under two hundred Members
come back after Easter holidays. Look
much more like as if they were going to a
funeral. Depression so overpowering that
by nine o'clock feel they really can't
stand any more. So House counted out,
which is pretty well for a Monday night in
April. Incidentally, second reading of
Necessitous Schools Bill carried after
feeblest show of opposition. Government
offer Schoolboards little present of over
£100,000 a year. Like young person who
shall be nameless they " want more." Make
show of righteous indignation at inade-
quacy of dole compared with that bestowed
on Church Schools. But half a loaf better
than no bread.
"They pocket the money," said PRINCE
ARTHUR, "whilst snapping at the hand
that bestows it. Would give a few half-
crowns to charity out of my private purse
if I were in position to get up after CHAN-
NINO had moved his hostile amendment
and announce that in view of honest
scruples of gentlemen opposite, the
Government feel bound to withdraw
Bill for present Session. How they
would howl; even cut themselves with
knives. But JOKIM says subject too seri-
ous. We can't afford to play with another
Education Bill. So they have their growl
and our £100,000."
Only ray of consolation on dull, dark
evening found in contemplation of coun-
tenance of JOHN o' GORST, time-honoured
Educationist. As SABK has said before,
the world has lost a great actor in GORST'B
accidental divagation into politics. De-
lightful to watch his face to-night as he
sat on Treasury Bench actually in charge
of an Education Bill. Behind him, visible
to the mind's eye, flit ghostly figures of the
Committee of Privy Council on Education
Now and then he furtively looked up and
down the Treasury Bench to seo if ho was
truly loft in untrammelled charge. Practi-
cally that was so. Occasionally PRINCK
ARTHUR stole in. with studiously casual air.
Possibly secretly anxious to learn if thp
Vice-President of the Council had broken
out in any fresh place. Anxiety concealed
behind smiling countenance. Would not
presume to approach his own seat as Leader
of the House. The Leader pro tern., the
Minister in charge of an important Bill,
was his esteemed friend the Vice-President
of the Council. With him at the helm all
was well with the Ship of State.
All the same. PRINCK ARTHUR thought it
desirable to ask the SOLICITOR-GENERAL to
remain in close attendance till the Bill was
throueh second reading. A thoroughly safe
man Sir R. FINLAY. No kicking over the
traces with him.
flusinfsx don/;. — Necessitous Board
Schools Bill read second time.
Tuesday.—It will be remembered how
when Mr. Vincr.nt Crummies found in locnl
newspapers paragraphs eulogistic of his
own nrt, or the talert of his incomparable
company, he was struck with marvel as to
"how these things get in the papers."
There 's nothing of Crummies about HICKS-
BBACH, save, momentarily, a similar state
of marvel. Here are the newspapers say-
ing that Conservative Member for Cnewe
has resolved to resign his seat. So credu-
lous is the public in these matters that,
rending announcement in print, they ac-
cepted it without reservation. The local
Conservatives, who might be expected to
know the mind of the sitting Member on
so important a matter, selected another can-
didate. Nay. so astute, far-seeing, and
well-informed a personage as DON JOSE,
wrote a letter wishing the new candidate
success I
The Liberals selected their man; the
fight in full fling, when it occurs to the
SAGE OF QUEEN ANNE'S GATE to ask HICKS-
BEACH if ROBERT WARD really had applied
tor the Chiltern Hundreds. No, said
HICKS-BEACH. It's all those newspapers.
"One more of the numerous instances in
which a newspaper report is incorrect."
The SAGE'S mind is as childlike as his
manner is bland. It was startling to hear
on this unimpeachable authority that whole

A SUGGESTED QUESTION FOR MR. C-GH-LL.
"May I ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer
whether he has received siny application from
Unionist Members expressing their desire to vacate
their seats in order to contest Crewc?"
business rested upon newspaper invention.
If HICKS-BEACH said it was so, so it must be.
But how about DON JOSE'S letter? His
knowledge is anterior to newspapers. He
could not possibly evolve out of his inner
consciousness the conviction that a critical
election for a scat held by a Government
supporter was pending owing to resigna-
tion of sitting Member. How about the
COLONIAL SECRETARY'S letter recommend-
ing a candidate for a seat that was not
vacant? The SAGE put the question with
look of almost infantile embarrassment
clouding his ingenuous countenance.
"I always," said DON JOSE, severely re-
garding the innocent intruder, "reply to
letters addressed to me in suitable terms."
The SAGE sank back slowly upon his seat,
staring into space with vacant eyes. There
aro some things beyond the comprehension
of average man. He feebly felt this Crewe
conundrum is one of them.
Htisinfss done.—Another Count Out.
Thursday.—Whilst HICKS-BEACH pic-
tured the marvellous growth of the British
Empire within the limits of the QUEEN'S
reign, the Right Hon. JEREMIAH LOWTHEH
was a sight to see. Such a miracle as
CHANCELLOR OF EXCHEQUER dilated upon
finds no parallel since the world began.
The expenditure has more than doubled;
but the revenue has forged ahead with
even greater briskness. This means more
taxation in the bulk, but so widespread has
been prosperity, upwards and downwards,
that the burden is borne in individual cases
much more easily than when, at the time
the QUEEN came to the Throne, it was
half as heavy in aggregate bulk. This not
only in spite of, actually by reason of, that
Free Trade over which JEREMIAH makes
Lamentation.
This would have been hard to bear from
SQUIRE OK MAI,WOOD, brought up from
early youth in quagmire paths. But from
HICKS-BEACH, in private life a Tory squire,
in public position CHANCELLOR OF EXCHE-
QUER in Conservative Government! It was
too much. Unwonted wrinkles marked
JEREMIAH'S mild and massive brow. An
ashen grey tinged his sometime ruddy
cheek. Once he pulled himself together,
and -feebly smiled. It was when HICKS-
BEACH incidentally expressed the wish that
HOWARD VINCENT had flourished in the
year preceding the QUEEN'S reign. JERE-
MIAH, who is quick at figures, knocked off
a sum which demonstrated that in such
case, the military and civil arms of the
State, the public platform, and the Parlia-
mentary forum, would to-day lack the
counsel and the company of the warrior
political economist. The House, seeing the
point HICKS-BEACH slyly made, hilariously
cheered. JEREMIAH sadly smiled, and as
the CHANCELLOR proceeded with his here-
tical dogmas, he relapsed into attitude of
utter woe.
"One of the stalest leaflets of the Cob-
den Club," he described the speech, when
forcing himself to stand up to remonstrate
against its delivery. But shocks like this
are not easily got over. Early in the sit-
ting JEREMIAH withdrew from public view,
to nourish in secret this fresh stab dealt by
the hand of a friend.
Business don«.—Budget brought in.
Friday.—Lawyers came to the front to-
night in Committee of Supply. On vote
for Land Registry Office, showed strong
desire to discuss Land Transfer Bill, at pre-
sent in the Lords. Chairman LOWTHER
sharply pulled them up. Out of order to
discuss the measure on vote in. Committee
of Supply. The third offender in this di-
rection being shut up, it seemed that vote
might forthwith be passed, when HOPKIN-
SON, Q.C., strolled in.
Charming fellow H. A pleasing presence,
a low, clear voice, an admirable speaker.
Looking at paper, finding Land Registry
Office under discussion, thoug-ht he would
say a few words. Rising diffidently, cross-
ins; one leg over the other, smiling sweetly
round the expectant Committee, he began,
"I think, Mr. LOWTHER, this is a singu-
larly convenient time to say a few words
about the Land Transfer Bill-"
"Order! order!" roared the Chairman.
Smile faded from HOPKINSON'S face; his
twined legs gave way at the knees; drop-
ping into his seat, he had explained to him
how, unconsciously, he had offended.
"I think," SARK whispered in his ear,
"this would be a singularly convenient
time for you to go home before you get
into further trouble." A bint HOPKINSON,
Q.C., mado haste to accept.
Business done.—In Committee of Supply.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A CASE OF GREAT INTEREST AT SOUTH KENSINGTON MUSEUM.
STUDY FROM LIFE.
RETRENCHMENT!
"!T is obvious," remarks a daily paper, "that the enormous
expense incurred this year by the fashionable world in connec-
tion with the Jubilee Festivities, will subsequently entail for
many a rigid and unpleasant economy." Hence we may look
for the appearance of such paragraphs as the following in next
year's Society journals: —
The Duke and Duchess of PEPPERCORN gave a select dinner-
party on Monday last at their new London house, No. 2, Slum
Alley, Whitechapel. Their garrets are furnished with the utmost
elegance, and an organ-grinder had been specially engaged to
play to the guests during dinner. The menu of course was simple,
but I hear that her Grace's chef de cuisine is unequalled at cooking
tripe and onions, while the PEPPERCORN cellars are famous
amongst epicures as containing some of the best ginger-beer in
London.
A highly fashionable wedding took place at St. Sepulchre's on
Wednesday, when Sir ALGERNON FITZCLARENCB was happily united
to Miss ERMYNTRUDK PI.ANTAOENET. Fortunately the weather
was all that could bo desired, as, in accordance with the present
fashion, the entire wedding-party walked to and from the church,
with the exception of the bride's father, who, owing to a recent
attack of gout, had to be accommodated with a wheelbarrow.
The bridal dresa was simply but tastefully made, being composed
entirelv of white calico, and the bouquet of daisies and butter-
cups which the bride carried was the cause of general admiration.
The wedding presents were numerous and (comparatively) costly,
including a pewter pint-pot, an electro-plated Jew's harp, and
several postal orders for eighteenpenee each. In the afternoon
the happy pair travelled by penny steamer to Rosherville, where
the honeymoon will be spent.
Owing to the genial spring the sporting prospects for this season
are exceptionally bright. The followers of the Quorn and
Pytchley have enjoyed some splendid rat-hunting lately. The
Duke of HURLIXGHAM has rented some well-preserved potato-
plots near Hammersmith, on which large bags are sure to be
made, as the sparrows are very plentiful. While on sporting
VOL. 0X11. 1
topics, it may be mentioned that that well-known angler, Mr.
MAYFLY, landed fifteen gudgeon lately in the course of two days'
fishing on the Regent's Park Canal.
Since golf and lawn-tennis have been abandoned, on account
of the ruinous expense which they involve, the good old English
game of skittles has become exceedingly popular with the fashion-
able world. It is said that several members of the Peerage will
be among the competitors on Saturday afternoon, when the
Seven, Dials Club is to hold its championship meeting.
Owing to the strict economy which has to be practised thig
year, the custom of going abroad for the holidays will be wholly
discontinued; indeed, several of the smartest people are con-
tenting themselves with a cheap Saturday-to-Monday excursion
to Southend. We notice that our contemporary, the Uaily
Tellewag, ever to the fore with philanthropic schemes, has started
a Summer Treat Fund for children of the impoverished aris-
tocracy. Owing to this well-timed movement, a large number
of those who will one day be the leaders of Society are sent
down, each Saturday to the Crystal Palace, where they spend a
thoroughly happy day. Before returning home each is pre-
sented with a bun, a new sixpence, and a china mug, on which
the arms of his or her family are emblazoned.
A very successful performance of that historical drama, Punch
and Judy, was given by an itinerant showman in Belgravo
Square the other evening, which was witnessed by a large and
aristocratic audience. Needless to say, all the theatres are now
closed, as no one could afford to pay even half-a-crown for a
stall in these days. From the same cause, great destitution
exists amongst musicians and authors. Dr. RICHTER is compelled
to utilise some of his orchestra as a street-band, while Mr.
LEONARD BORWICK may have been seen of late playing a piano-
organ. And since no one is able to afford a library subscription,
Mr. ANTHONY HOPE and Dr. CONAN DOYLE now find employment
in the writing of penny novelettes.
I have only room to add, that it is quite the correct thing to
be dressed as simply as possible this season. A very charming
costume was worn by a lady of title at a recent party. The
body was made of household flannel, the skirt of sacking, and the
whole was trimmed with bows of pink tape. For second-hand hats
you cannot do better than go to Mr. ABRAHAM'S pawn-shop; he
numbers among his clientele most of the fashionable people in
town, and his prices are most moderate—a very important fact
when, in consequence of last year's Jubilee, we have to practise
"a rigid and unpleasant economy I"
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
IN the direction of imposing on the human mind the sensation
known as making your flesh creep, the Fat Boy in Pickwick isn't
in it with The Oxford Dictionary. The phrase is here applied
in its sense of concentrated marvel. Never since the writing of
books began was there such a monumental undertaking as this
dictionary, edited by Mr. JOSEPH WRIGHT, published by
HENRY FROWDE. For close upon a quarter of a century a multi-
tude of people in all parts of the United Kingdom have been
engaged in collecting materials for it. It is like a hive of bees;
perhaps more exactly like the coral insects which, in the course of
time, uplift rocks and islands out of the sea. ''The workshop,"
as it is modestly called, has now completed its appointed task as
far as the letter D, has even made some progress with the letter
F. As a rule one does not take up a dictionary for ordinary
reading. An exception will certainly be found in the case of
The Oxford Dictionary. It is an inexhaustible mine of interest-
ing information, garnered from all known writers and multitudes
of unknown. For busy people the book may indeed be found
fatally fascinating. My Baronite, setting forth to look out tho
bearings of a particular word, turning over page after page,
came upon so many attractive bits that he found, to his ama/e-
ment, an hour had sped.
A Farrago of Folly, by GEOROB GAMBLE (FISHER UNWIN), is
unflinchingly described in its second title as "Some Vagaries and
Verbosities of Two Vulgarians." Certain critics will probably
find vulgarity the note of the book. But that is a tribute to its
life-like touch. You cannot expect the repose of good manner in
two young people who make chance acquaintance in a picture
gallery,where the lady attempts to steal the gentleman's book. This
pleasantry so much endears her to him that, after several meet-
ings and partings, they secretly depart for Paris, and live there
for a few days as brother and sister. The book is decidedly
original, and would rank much higher if it were less determinedly
funny. My Baronite believes that even Vulgarians do not in
private conversation persistently talk with music-hall smartness.
It is presumably a first effort, and Mr. GAMBLE will do better
when he plays more quietly. The account of a night bicycle
journey is appropriately full"of go. THE BARON DE B.-W.

WHEN woes are greatest, words are ever
weak
The grief-choked passion of the soul to
speak.
And what avail they here? Pressure of
hand,
The silent look which love can understand,
Perchance are best, though all unhelpful
they
The pain to lessen or the tear to stay.
Beautiful Paris, stricken with mad grief!
The rolling hours alone can lend relief
To such a shattering anguish as is this.
Gay lips, fresh from the joy of childhood's
kiss,
Blackened to awful silence at a stroke!
Since o'er Pompeii the death-deluge broke
Scarce aught of swifter horror] Gentle
hearts,
Playing their beautiful and blameless parts
As high-bred almoners of Charity,
Midst modish glitter and patrician glee,
And poor blind children, in wild tumult
blent,
Hurried to death together, impotent
In the red clutches of relentless flame!
A piteous holocaust! The noblest name,
The haughtiest beauty and the gentlest
grace,
Glory of history or pride of race,
Availed no more than childish helpless-
ness
In that dread hour of torture's fiercest
stress,
When the new Moloch claimed his shud-
dering prey;
And the poor shapeless heaps that scat-
tered lay
About that fatal booth—death-trap and
snare,
For whose black end the burden who would
bear ?—
Brought anguish to the noblest homes in
France,
And half the Courts of Europe.
Pity's glance,
Which is no gloating ghoul's, must turn
aside
From that dread scene where Paris, in her
pride
Of birth, and beauty, and benevolence,
Was smitten sore. A silent reverence
To sorrow so unspeakable is due.
That scattered gold which the grave sol-
diers drew
From forth that awful wreckage, was
designed
To assuage miseries of poor human kind;
And a less glorious death-roll hath been
writ
In golden blazon by heraldic wit.
Than that of the great ladies and fair girls
Who, through fire's torturing flame and
black smoke-whirls,
Passed to sweet womanly Charity's reward,
True martyrs of Humanity!
The sward
Of the gay city gleams, boughs laugh with
leaves,
But in the budding Springtime Paris
grieves.
"Yet tears to human sufferings are due,"
Sang the austere Lake poet, grave but
true,
Sunt lachrymw rerum! How the general
heart
Echoes the Mantuan's music, claiming part
In all great sorrows, which must general
be

"What is your view of horses?"

under proper control. I would have them go at a walking pace,

"What about pedestrians?"
"I confess that pedestrians are a nuisance. They should never
lave been allowed to monopolise the pavements and footpaths.
I fear the mischief is done in that direction, but there is no
reason why they should act as if the public highway belonged to

FOR AND AGAINST THE CHIMNEY-POT HAT.
(Vide Recent Correspondence in the "Timei.")
IT would be advisable, or inadvisable, as the case may be, to
abolish It in the Jubilee Year.
Because all the scarecrows in the country are already fitted.
Because It is the hall-mark of human dignity, and, combined
with a smile, is sufficient by itself, without any other costume,
to stamp the wearer as one of Nature's Noblemen, whether he
be a Missing Link or a King of the Cannibal Islands.
Because It is indispensable, as part of the stock-in-trade of
conjurers, for the production of five rabbits, pots of flowers,
interminable knotted handkerchiefs, and other useful and neces-
sary articles.
Because no Harrow boy is happy till he gets It.
Because It is a. decided protection in a street-fight, or when
you fall out hunting or coming home late from the Club.
Because It only needs to be carefully sat on to make an ex-
cellent and noiseless substitute for the concertina.
Because no self-respecting Guy, Bridegroom, or 'Bus-driver,
is ever seen without one.
Because It is a very effective counterpart of the Matinee hat
at Lord's, and similar gatherings.
Because, to be at all in the fashion, and to look decently
dressed, you require a fresh one every day. This is good for
the trade.
Because It stimulates the manufacture of umbrellas, eye-
glasses, hansom cabs, frock-coats, hair-restorers, and forcible
language.
Because no one has yet ventured to wear It on the all-preva-
lent bicycle.
Because no statue lias ever had the face to sport It, with very
few deplorable exceptions.
Because It is really the most becoming head-gear hitherto
devised.
Because It is really the most unbecoming head-gear hitherto
devised.
Because, after a hundred years, it is time we had a change.
Because, when a thing has been running for a century, it is
a pity to abolish it.
Because, if It is abolished, the custom of raising It to ladies
will perish as well, and there will follow the Extinction of
Manners for Men, the Decadence of Church Parade, the General
Cutting of Acquaintances, the re-introduction of Thumb-biting,
Mose-pulling, Duelling, and Civil War, the disappearance of Great
Britain as a first-class Power, the establishment of a Reign of

THE DIAMOND JUBILEE.
A SUGGESTION.
DEAR MB. PUNCH,—I am sick of this everlasting pother about
;he Diamond Jubilee. Didn't we have it all ten years ago?
there no originality left in the world P For Heaven's sake let
us have a little novelty.
Is it not preposterous that at this time of day we should be
>rganising another mediieval pageant to parade the streets of
London? Let us have something fresh, something progressive,
something democratic—something typical of the spirit of the
age. What are your gilded coaches, your cream-coloured steeds,
your escorts of princes? Belies of barbarism! No, Sir; instead
)f this tinsel show, let us have something simple, business-like,
'neat, not gaudy." L«t the Procession go to St. Paul's on
jicycles. Lord SALISBURT and Mr. GLADSTONE on a tandem,
change places alternately.
Hoping that you will see your way to give publicity to my
suggestion, I am, dear Mr. Punch, lours, &c.,
PNEUMATIC.

A MARVELLOUS PANACEA!
EXTRAORDINARY RECOVERY!
Head the Testimonials from the Faculty.
DOCTOR NICHOLAS •writes:—"I have tried the 'Concert Cu-
rative,' and found it efficacious where all other treatment had
failed to achieve the result I was anxious to obtain. It doet not
act too violently upon the system, but, after allowing the symptoms
to run their natural course, protects the sufferer from an otherwise
inevitable collapse.'
Doctor WILHELM writes :—" I consider this an admirable pre-
paration, and, in the proper hands, absolutely infallible. I take
care to recommend it strongly in consultation with all my fellow-
practitioners."
Doctor FRANCOIS F. FAURE writes:—" I entirely endorse the
opinion of my esteemed colleague, Dr. NICHOLAS. A most
charming and elegant tonic—with no disagreeable after-effects."
Doctor FRANCIS JOSEPH writes :—" It is compounded of several
powerful and dangerous ingredients, but so ingeniously combined
as to neutralise one another in the happiest manner."
Doctor HUMBERT writes :—" Very pleasant to take, as it does
not irritate the patient, but acts as an emollient."
Doctor SALISBURY writes:—"I confess I have never been a
firm believer in the efficacy of patent medicines in general, but in
the present instance I feel bound to add my testimony to the almost
unanimous verdict of my professional brethren.
"After having, not without hesitation, given my consent to
the employment of your remedy in a case which had resisted all
previous treatments, my belief is—I hope I do not speak too soon
—that it has succeeded in preventing all further effusion of blood,
and localising the danger.
"Whatever future changes may take place, I shall still have the
satisfaction of believing that they will be under the sanction and
augury of the leading European specialists, and that all danger of
serious complications has been happily averted.
'' If that is the result—I trust I am not premature—I cannot
help thinking that it will be a great aeMtvement."
Now READ WHAT THE PATIENT HIMSELF SAYS!
"A SICK MAN" writes:—"I was almost at my last gasp; I
was constantly haunted by a feeling as if I should FLY ALL TO
PIECES, and the dread that I should NOT LAST MUCH
LONGER. All my European friends declared that I was NOT
FIT TO GO ABOUT. I seemed to have lost all control over my
movements, and was A MASS OF CORRUPTION.
"Several acquaintances of mine in Armenia told me that I
LOOKED LIKE DEATH. None of the physicians who under-
took to cure me did me any good. I GOT WORSE EVERY
DAY, and could attend to nothing—until at last I was strongly
recommended to try MOTHER EUROPA'S WORLD-RE-
NOWNED 'CONCERT' CURATIVE.
"I resisted for some time, but, discovering it was not un-
pleasant, I took it regularly during a prolonged residence in Crete,
and gradually found myself beginning to return to active life and
my ordinary occupations.
"After having been given up as A DOOMED MAN by Dr.
SALISBURY and all the LEADING CONTINENTAL AUTHO-
RITIES, I ain rapidly getting STRONGER DAY BY DAY,
have thrown away my crutches, and am now WALKING OVER
GREECE without the slightest difficulty or inconvenience of any

Why, I was doing nothing—only seeing how to manage a

No right to cruise about within the sphere of action 1 Why
not? I wasn't bombarding anyone.
Well, I give you fair warning, that if I am put to any more
inconvenience I will appeal to my Government. And if that
won't do—mind, I mean it!—I will write to the Times!

A SEASONABLE SUGGESTION.
To the Editor of Punch.
DEAR SIR,—Just now there are so many
extra calls upon the pockets of the
"smart," that I am sure a move in the
direction of economy would be very wel-
come amongst "the upper ten," or say,
"the more select quarter million." For
instance, it is the pride of some hostesses
to have a crowd at their at-home days. If
the many social functions of the present
memorable season should deprive them of
the glory of a large gathering, they would
naturally feel annoyed. Now cannot this
be remedied? I think so. Why not hire
a carriage and a man who thoroughly
understands his business from a livery
stable? But it will be objected that a
vehicle staying outside a door for hours
would look peculiar. At first it might be
considered as suggestive of the creme de
la creme, but after a while the immobility
of the vehicle would be understood, and
cover the hirer with ridicule. And here
my idea comes in.
All that is wanted is as before, a
brougham and a coachman who thoroughly
understands his business. Mark the quali-
fication, "who thoroughly understands his
business." Now the brougham drives up,
and the neighbours notice that the coach-
man is clean shaven and has mutton-chop
whiskers. The vehicle drives away after
a sufficient pause. Then comes another
coachman driving a brougham. He evi-
dently belongs to an owner with military
tastes, for he has a black moustache. He
retires, and is succeeded later on by an old
retainer of a coachman, with white hair
and a venerable beard allowed to be worn,
no doubt, on account of his many years of
faithful service. But it will be contended
"so many carriages will be expensive?"
Not at all. There will be only one vehicle,
and the coachman who thoroughly knows
his business will do the rest. The moment
the Jehu is out of sight, he will change 1
costume with the utmost rapidity, ai
then return to your house a dmerei
(outer) man. The effect might be i
creased by supplied visitors, who wou
also change their appearance at the san
time as the coachman altered his. Th
could easily be done in the brougha:
itself.

House of Commons, Monday, May 3.—
LOUGH, though in later life he mixes bis
tea in London, had his earliest breakfast
in Ireland. Occasionally, as to-night, he
pleasantly reminds House of his pater-
nity. Had question on paper addressed to
WALTER LONG with reference to muzzling
of dogs. Answer given with wealth of de-
tail. LOUGH, charmed with the conversa-
tion, desires to prolong it. SPEAKER benefi-
cently sharp on Members who attempt to
ovade rule that notice must be given ot
questions. The only safe thing is to as-
sume that Minister has broken fresh ground
by his reply. That done, the Member says,
"Arising out of that answer I beg to
ask"
To-night WALTER LONG having made his
answer, sat down. Up jumped LOUGH,
holding out a letter snatched from his
pocket. "May I," he said, "ask a ques-
tion which has been sent to me by a cor-
respondent, arising out of that answer?"
We are getting on to end of century.
What with telegraphs, telephones, torpedo-
catchers, big wheels, balloons, motor-cars,
and railway trains running through the sea,
we are doing pretty well in the way of
inter-communication. House felt LOUGH'S
correspondent took the cake. Echo of
LONG'S answer still rumbled through
chamber. Yet here was Member for West
Islington with a letter in his hand "arising
out of that answer" which correspondent
had written, posted and obtained de-
livery of!
House roared with delight, whilst LOUGH
stood staring round, wondering what on
earth he had said now. "Only shows,"
says WILFRID LAWSON, "how strong is the
force of habit. A man who spends his
morning mixing tea is apt in the late after-
noon to mbc his sentences."

criminals. CAMERON moved resolution call-
ing upon Government to establish adult
reformatories for the special treatment ot
this class of our sisters and brothers. In
course of his address CAMKKON had much to
say about long sentences and short sen-
tences. His speech was rather a long
sentence, extending over three quarters of
an hour in delivery. Question important
and interesting. Members accordingly
went out to think it over. Thus it came
to pass that FARQUHARSON came into heri-
tage of an audience fully twelve strong.
Was evidently in fine form. Cleared his
voice with one or two preliminary but elo-
quent coughs; squared his elbows; tugged
alternately at his shirt cuffs; shook his legs
out about the knees; was just getting into
stride when someone suggested that per-
haps the House had better be counted.
FARQUHARSON sat down; sand-glass on table
turned; bells clanged through all the corri-
dors. Slowly a score of Members trooped
in; but the habitual criminals, acting in
accordance with those ingrained habits
CAMERON deplored, remained in their lairs.
When SPEAKER counted he found only
thirty within signalling distance of his
cocked hat. So, at ten minutes to five,
House counted out, beating all recent re-
cord in the matter of earliness of the hour.
FARQUHARSON not at all puffed up at this
achievement worthy of Jubilee Year. "Tut,
tut," he said, blushing, when congratu-
lated. "In the circumstances anyone
could have done it."
But we know better. PRINCE ARTHUR,
who, following the SQUIRE OP MALWOOD'S
example, is sitting by his own fireside to-

whose gravity is one of the safeguards of
the Great Powers in times of crisis, so
smitten by contagious merriment that he
could hardly frame a reply. House roared
afresh when he assured FIELD that the
captive knight was in no personal danger,
and that application had been made to
pool. The captain was for instant surren-
der. The crew (aged thirteen) sobbed
bitterly. SILOMIO was pale, but that ap-
pearance was owing to other causes than
tear. The sea was much more perturbed
than was the hero.
"We will hold on our course," he said,
"and let Greece take the consequences.
If a hand is laid on me, England will rise
as one man, and demand a million sterling
for moral and intellectual damage."

A_MOMKNT OF TlUUMPH FOR THE GREEK FLEET!
Thursday.—Long time since House of
Commons been in such merry mood. Cir-
cumstances attendant thereupon made
case more remarkable. The morning
newspapers presented their customary
contribution of war news. A great battle
impending at Pharsala; fierce fighting at
Velestino; the iron hand of the Turk
slowly but surely closing round the wrist
of the Greek. Stirring news; but it all
faded into nothingness before the import
of one detail. Unfortunate on land, the
Greek fleet had by a single stroke re-
trieved the fortunes of the day.
It had captured SILOMIO!
Yes; BASHMEAD-AHTLETT, Knight, the
elect of Sheffield, the pride of the Senate,
the champion of the Empire, the ca-
nonized or Swaziland, outmanreuvred at
sea, is carried captive to Athens.
It might be thought, in face of such
national calamity, that the flag would fly
at half-mast on Victoria Tower, that shops
would be closed, that bells would toll,
that the House of Commons would mourn-
fully adjourn. "Instead of which," as the
irrepressible judge said, here was the
House on the broadest of grins, breaking
forth into uproarious laughter when Ad-
miral FIELD, in his best transpontine
quarter-deck manner, enquired what the
Foreign Office were going to do in the
(The Captive enters Athena.')
Slace him at disposal of HER MAJESTY'S
linister at Athens.
Business done.—Irishmen for once united
(in fresh demands on Exchequer), repulsed
by 219 votes against 127.
Friday.—SAHK has some particulars of
the naval engagement off Salonica, which
shows it to have been rather a desperate
affair. Don't know how he got the des-
patch, but it reads as if it came from
headquarters.
SILOMIO setting forth from Larissa to
Athens, intent upon resuming charge of
imperial affairs at Westminster, was
warned of danger. The whole Greek fleet
was on the look out for him. Let him give
them the slip, and go by land.
"Bismallah!" said the doughty knight.
"A Primrose Leaguer does not go off his
ordered course for any foe."
After an hour's sailing from Tzayezi,
something at first taken for a cloud began
to converge on the sailing boat which car-
ried SILOMIO and his fortunes. The hero
was at the moment lying at the bottom of
the skiff, the sea being choppy. But
at sign of danger he rose to his
knees and, fixing his eyeglass, scan-
ned the horizon. The cloud drawing
nearer, turned out to be the Greek Fleet.
SILOMIO was entrapped. His little boat
was as if caught in the vortex of a whirl-
In a few minutes a torpedo boat
emerged from the slowly-closing circle;
made straight for the sailing boat: cap-
tured the knight; conveyed him to Ad-
miral's flagship, where he was received
with full honours, officers and crew drawn
up to receive him.
"You ought to have been at Salamis,"
said the Admiral, respectfully saluting.
"Thank you," said SILOMIO, gratefully
feeling a firmer tread on the deck of the
man-of-war; "I 've had enough of travel
just now, and, if you could arrange it,
would rather be dropped at Sheffield."
This despatch (delayed in transmission)
bears sign of hasty writing. But it also
carries the impress of truth.

QUESTIONS IN THE HOUSE.
THE other day Mr. LOUGH asked the
President of the Board of Agriculture
whether a dog must have a muzzle on
when taking his morning bath in a pond
on Peckham Rye. Since then notice has
been given of the following questions: —
Mr. LUFFER. — To ask Mr. HANBURY
what would be the postage of a letter from
Brixton to Bogota, the envelope of which
contained, in addition to two sheets of
note-paper, one woollen comforter, knitted
by his, Mr. LUFFFJI'S, sister-in-law.
Mr. MUFFER.—To- ask the Chancellor of
the Exchequer the name and address of a
shop, in or near Clapham, where his, Mr.
MUFFER'S, aunt can obtain good bird-seed
for her canary at the lowest price.
Mr. STUFKER.—To ask the Home Secre-
tary whether if he, Mr. STUFFER, should
visit Margate during the summer, the right
honourable gentleman could recommend an
hotel where the terms are small and the
meals are large.
Mr. BUFFER.—To ask the TTnder-Secre-
tary of State for Foreign Affairs, as he,
Mr. CURZON, has personally studied the
manners and customs of Persia, whether
his, Mr. BUFFER'S, cat, a native of that
country, should be fed with ordinary Eng-
lish meat, or with some diet of a more
oriental nature.
Mr. DUFFER.—To ask the First Lord of
the Admiralty whether, in the event of
his, Mr. DUFFER'S, great uncle visiting
Southend. it would be advisable, in view
of possible adverse winds, that he, Mr.
DUFFER'S great uncle, should attach his,
Mr. DUFFER'S great uncle's, hat to his
waistcoat by means of a cord or other
appliance called a hat-guard.
DARBY JONES CONSIDERS KEMPTON.
HONOURED SIR,—Who is the Gentleman
who starts rumours about Non-starters for
Big Races? Naturally Echo will query
the term "gentleman," but it would per-
haps surprise you, Sir, and the Peers,
Baronets, and Members of the Privy
Council, who complete their education by
committing the axioms of Professor
PUNCH to Memory, to know that on those
grades of Society which I may call the
Lower Rungs of the Ladder, the word
"gentleman" possesses no attribute of
superiority, but is always applied to One
possessing the Bounder-like characteristics
of the Kangaroo—a being, indeed, looked
down upon from a perch by the Common
or Jubilee Cad. Well, Sir, one of these
Esquires by indefinite right put it about
that Galtee, More would not start for the
Guineas at Newmarket, and the Prophet
was only able to nail the Second and
Third on the Board of Speculation, the
lay of the Minstrel at 50 to 1 for a win
and 4 to 1 for a place possibly reflecting
some of that credit displayed by a well-
polished, hall-marked silver soup-ladlo on
your henchman and heeler.
Lord ROSEBERY deplored, I believe, that
he had met with another Isinglass. The
noble earl has met with continual Ixin-
fllasses during his Political and Turf career,
but, like little Jack Homer, he is still
sitting in his corner, pulling out the
Plums of Life, and on his fiftieth birth-
day (good gracious me I it was only yester-
day that he was Lord DALMENY at Eton!),
I beg to tender him my sincere congratu-
lations, wishing him over the Derby that
luck which befell Sah-ation Yeo in West-
ward Ho, when he and Ainyas Leigh en-
countered the Gubbins clan on the moors
of Devon. His Lordship will know what
I mean, honoured Sir, even if the refer-
ence pass your understanding.
Hats off to the Ditch, to the Rutland
Arms, and the Jockey Club! Away to
Sunbury by the Thames, to the Most Con-
venient Racu Course in the World—and
that is saying a great deal—Kempton
Park, the demesne of Mr. S. H. HYDE,
who apparently is about, as a Model Ma-
gistrate and a Simple District Councillor,
to sit upon himself as tho wicked Manager
of a Sinhil Spot, where the voice of the
"Bookie" mingles with that of the
thrush and the blackbird. Mark you, Sir,
I don't say that Kempton is the best race
track in tho world, all I say, it is the most
convenient. If you, or any other Master
of Savnir Fain, will tell me another place
devoted to the Sport, wherewithal Mon-
archs are supposed to amuse themselves in
their hours of pastime, so perfectly "get-
at-able" in all sorts and conditions of
weather, I should be glad to know the
name of that rendezvous. For my own
part, there is only one Kempton which
can be reached under shelter the whole
way from your front door in London
to your Grand Stand or Members' En-
closure, i-id Waterloo Station, and once
there, you need never bo grilled by the
sun or pelted by the rain. Take my
word for it, Sir, if the nave of the
Crystal Palace were turned into a
cricket ground, it would be equally popu-
lar. Nowadays your pleasure-seeker likes
to be taken to, and brought back from,
bis temporary Mecca without disturbing
the cotton-wool in which he is of course
packed as a precaution against the cli-
mate. Oh! dear me, why doesn't the
Aggravated-Grandmothers League let the
rich or poor race-goer alone? At Kemp-
ton Park ho has everything done to make
him respectable and harmless, and yet the
A.-G. Leaguers won't let him enjoy him-
self after his own way. It isn't the folk,
who show themselves at a Gathering of
this kind, who go homo in a hurry and
volunteer for the Greek Army on the
morrow. But, as my friend Captain
QUISBY always remarks, "The real gam-
blers are those who frequent disreputable
houses in Soho, where the Tape runs from
morning till night, and who don't know a
horse from a gander." Even the other
colleague to whom Lord SALISBURY re-
cently referred when they brought back
Peace and Honour from Berlin, was an
unsuccessful plunger. I believe, too, that
Mr. LAUOUCHERE, M.P., is a Greater
Englander, when the interests of 1'ari-
Mtituc,! are attacked.
But let me to work, and endeavour to
unravel the skein of the Diamond Jubilee
Stakes, which are to be run in the Park of
HYDE and seek. Here goes.
You will not Shoot the Bird this time,
Nor weddinp* bolls for Hw>banii chime;

Who oft the barker h«R beguiled
And sometimes coat him dearly;
Together with the Iftxturr, who

honoured Sir, on your devoted adherent

CHA.RITY AT HOME.
(Erlraclfrom the Diary of a Philanthropist.)
Monday.—Received an application from a Society for the
Extension of Education amongst those most in need of it. Very
proper scheme. Regard it with the heartiest approval. Seems
old-established, too. Wonder why I have not heard of it before.
The circular enlightens me. "Taking advantage of the approach-
ing auspicious occasion." I see. Well, will consider it with the
others already forwarded.
Tiifsday.—Appeal from the management of "The Self-Sup-
porting Orphans." Good notion, \\hen a baby is left destitute
the organisation steps in and sets it up in business. Refer to
appended documents, and discover that its foundation dates
back several decades. \\ hy have I been addressed after this
neglect of years? Ah, to be sure, "Taking advantage of the
approaching auspicious occasion." Pigeon-hole with the others.
Wednesday.—Another appeal! This time the lower creation
attracts attention. "Home for Reclaimable Blackbeetles."
Seems commendable. Idea to turn a pest into a blessing. Train
blackbeetles to spin silk. Wonder why I have never heard of
the scheme before. Founded, too, fifty years ago. Ah, I see,
"Taking advantage of the approaching auspicious occasion."
Appears to be common form. Circular is added to the rest.
Thursday.—Post brings in customary application. "Convales-
cent Home for the Healthy." I see. Not a bad idea. Preven-
tion better than cure. If people are well, keep them so.
Wonder why it has not been started before. It has. Founded
early in the century. Why then address me at this late hour?
Oh, I see, "Taking advantage of the approaching auspicious
occasion." Added to the others.
Friday.—Postman with the usual batch. "Cinderellas for the
Aged." Why not cheer the evenings of second childhood! Cer-
tainly, why not? The cheering seems to have been going on for
some time. But why now address me? Ah, "Taking advantage
of the approaching auspicious occasion." I have heard the
phrase before. Put away with the others.
Saturday.—Again they come. "Homes for the Affluent!"
Argument, if the poor are looked after, why not the rich? Seems
something in the idea. Circular proves that the charity is older
than the century. Dear me. \\ onder why I should have been
addressed. Suppose they thought, "better late than never."
Not exactly. "Taking advantage of the approaching auspicious
occasion." Exactly.
Sunday.—Looking through my benevolent bequests for the
past week. Plenty of them, and ninety-nine per cent, to "com-
memorate the approaching auspicious occasion." A little
awkward! Hundreds of applications sent in. Can't attend to
every suggestion. Invidious to make a selection. Perhaps the
best thing to do, as I cannot subscribe to all, is, to give to none 1

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
OUIDA'S latest novel. The Mossarenfs (SAMPSON Low & Co.),
is, from every point or view, excellent. Since THACKERAY'S im-
mortal "Becky," there has not been drawn by any satirical
writer a type so true to nature, to nature, that is, with its natu-
ral good almost obliterated, and its evil fully developed, as the
Lady Kenilworth of this story, known in her family as " Mouse."
THACKERAY'S heroine in his "Novel without a hero " sprang from
the people, and had to work her way upwards to position and
fortune: OUIDA'S heroine, on the other hand, is a patrician of
patricians, lacking the true nobility of race, but a spoilt child,
with an hereditary contempt for the plcbs, a cultured sensual-
ist with so powerful a hu-nger for money that no amount of
wealth could appease, and with such a capacity for profligacy that
millions cannot satisfy. The picture of her husband, "Cocky,"
son of the Duke of Otterbourne, as he lived and as he died, is
drawn with great power; and the sketches of the very smartest
of the most modern Smart Society are as true as they are in-
tentionally caustic and disillusioning. There are three straight-
forward, virtuous persons in the dramatis ptrsontt, and of these
the first is the co-heroine, Kathrrine Massarenf., who seems just
a bit too hard to be quite lovable; yet is she well mated to the
second Lord Hurstmanccaiix, an admirably conceived character,
just good enough to be true; while the third is the young Duke,
a mere child, a splendid little fellow, worth a wilderness of Little
Lord Fauntleroys. The finish of the story is as artistic as is that
of Vanity Fair, and to no work of fiction can a higher compli-
ment bo paid. The quite unnecessary introduction of an exalted
personage is non-essential, and is decidedly an error; but it is
the only one. Of this novel, as a photograph from life at high
pressure in these last years of the nineteenth century, it may
he truly said that, beyond interesting and amusing, it gives
food for serious reflection. Is our time morally worse than
that of the Tudors, the Stuarts, or of the Regency? More than
ever is it essential to keep up "appearances," and to observe,
most strictly, "fes conrrnanffJ!"; then, these canons being
obeyed, "Respectability," that "tribute which Vice pays to
Virtue," is the note of Modern Society.
If OUIDA had required prototypes for her Modem Society
characters she had only to turn to a book recently published by
FISHER UNWIN, entitled, Twelve Had Women, and from that
compilation, excellently well done, with a moral to every narra-
tive, she could have selected either Lady FRANCES HOWARD, who
"flourished" between 1593 and 1632, or have taken as a model
BARBARA VILLIERS, Duchess of Cleveland (1G40-1709), or ALICE
FERRERS, the favourite of KINO EDWARD THE THIRD, to whom
this amiable lady seems to have played the part of Becky to Jos
Ki'dlcy in his declining years. It is a curious book, as morbidly
interesting as a well-written Newgate Calendar; but it can only
be recommended to the healthiest, and cannot with safety be
given as a pass-time to an invalid who, himself blessed with a
clear conscience, yet suffering from an evil liver, would scarcely
be cheered or consoled by the example of such notorious "evil
livers" as are those of wh'om he will read in this work.
THE BARON DE B.-W.
p.S.—Writing last week about The Oxford Dictionary, my
Baronite, temporarily dazed with the erudition of the monumental
work, attributed the editorship to Professor JOSEPH WRIGHT.
That was Wrong. It is The English Dialect Dictionary Professor
WRIGHT edited. The Editors of The Oxford Dictionary are Dr.
JAMES MURRAY and HENRY BRADLEY.
PROSPECT FOR A NEW EQUESTRIAN STATUE.—The owner of this
year's Derby favourite says, "If he wins he will have the horse's
statue made in gold." If he loses, the statue shall be made all
the same, but—in "beaten gold."

TRUE GENIUS.
(A slightly Anticipatory Interview.)
FEELING sure that some account of the life of Mr. WILLIAM

the public, I called upon that gentleman a few days ago in his
delightful 'London house.

for him the grateful recognition of the public. "
“Yes," he said, after our preliminary greetings had been ex-
changed, “I may say, without boasting, that my position has
only been gained after many years of patient struggle. Never
can I forget what I owe to the early discouragement given me
by my dear father. On one occasion he heard me explaining
to a friend the plot of a story which ”-and the recollection

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, May 10.—
Since the Session opened the lot of JOHN
o' GORST has not been entirely a happy
one. But it is a little too much that in a
moderately full House, in the presence of
an acquiescing SPEAKER, he should be
hailed by the son of the PRIME MINISTER
as the very D himself. Of course
HUGH CECIL couldn't fill in the letters and
pronounce_ the word as spelt in the New
Oxford Dictionary. What he did was to
drop—or rather to soar—into poetry.
The regrettable incident happened in

Council could not sanction the new Clause
presented with that intent. Then UD gat
the gaunt figure of brother HUGH. Wring-
ing his hands wtith passionate energy,
turning flaming eyes on the placid figure
seated solitary on Treasury Bench, HUGH
apostrophised him as "Lucifer, son of the
morning," and lamented his abyssmal fall.
Of course everyone remembers Lucifer
in what is probably the earliest article of
the now familiar series, "Celebrities at

scribes the host as a three-faced giant.
One face, he adds, is yellow, a hue as-

the visitor could do it only with two; at
"every mouth he champed a sinner."

Morning "!
Lord H-gh C-c-1.
Now, is that what Lord HUGH CECIL
meant, or had he in his mind some milder
vision more applicable to the repository ot
the confidences, the reflector of the dignity,
of the Privy Council? At best the remark
seems unparliamentary. That it should
have escaped rebuke at the hands of an
exceedingly watchful SPEAKER only adds to
the regrettableness of the incident. JOHN
o' GORST took no notice at the moment.
A little later he lived at least halfway
up to the picture, with one mouth champ-
ing three sinners—CRANBORNB, brother
HUGH, and J. G. TALBOT, who, with most
melancholy mien, supported the new
Clause.
Business done.—Necessitous Board School
Bill through Committee.
Tuesday.—RASCH, with characteristic
boldness, attempted to make a House after
morning sitting. Positively succeeded,
and after brief debate, induced House to
pass resolution affirming that "The dura-
tion of speeches in this House has in-
creased, is increasing, and ought to he
abated." CALDWELL, who has strong views
on the subject, wanted to second resolu-
tion. But RADCLIFFE COOKE had already
volunteered. House regretted lost oppor-
tunity of hearing CALDWELL: rewarded by
delightful incident in connection with RAD-
CLIFFB COOKE'S speech. So righteously
eager for brevity was he that he went on
and on till Members at length could stand
no more. Angry shouts of "Divide!

Debate interesting, but offered no
practical solution of the question.
H. M. STANLEY tells me of experience he
had in Central Africa which he forgot to
mention in any of his books. He came
upon a tribe whose affairs of State were
administered by a council meeting once
a week. Some of the members developed
inconvenient tendency to making long
speeches. Efforts made to check it by the
flinging of friendly assegais gave only tem-
porary relief. The orator, thus inter-
rupted, never spoke again, but somebody
else took up the story, and the number of
the tribe steadily decreased.
An old Brave having passed a restless
night thinking over the difficulty, had a
happy idea that was instantly adopted. At
the time of STANLEY'S visit it was the cus-

torn for any member addressing the coun-
cil to stand on one leg. When, through
fatigue, he touched the ground, even with
the toe of his other foot, his speech was
peremptorily ended. The plan has the
further advantage that even in the case of
peculiarly gifted men, able by practice to
stand a long time on one foot, a gentle
nudge will upset their equilibrium, and
bring their speech to a conclusion. Next
time reform of Parliamentary procedure is
discussed in the Commons it might be
worth while to consider this device of the
simple African.

o'clock, debate fluttered round proposal to

nunciation of Bill by DALZIEL; far away
the best speech he has made since he came

fifteen minutes, scene was changed to one

ter-cheers ringing across the floor.
It is the old story of circumstances
altering DON Josh's case. "An admirable
exhibition of political agility," BRTCE de-
scribed the speech, he himself happily
inspired with unprofessorial vigour. As for
HONEST JOHN, he sat on the front bench,
watching his old friend and colleague with
half-amused smile, his eyes twinkling at
the enthusiastic cheers with which the
Tories applauded their old foeman.
"What were you thinking about?" I
asked him as we went out to the division
lobby.
"I was thinking," said HONEST JOHN,
"how true it is that the poet ia a seer.

But there are some lines of his about
JOHN CAM HOBHOUSE which, with the alte-
ration of a proper name, might have been

my friend and companion dear of 1880-5.

proach to the Fat Boy present Parliament

a good deal at time of General Election
about One Man One Vote. Now we have
detailed accounts of One Member Two
Bodies. The scare began with M'Dp.u-
MOTT, who makes oath and saith, that on
an hour and a day when TAT PAT in tho
flesh (such of it as there is) was in Athlone,
he (the deponent) coming in after dinner,
saw and spoke to the hon. Member in the
House of Commons.
That of itself is not extraordinary.
There is a well-authenticated case, cele-
brated in familiar verse, where a great
statesman, seated ono evening about the
same hour on the Treasury Bench, saw two
Speakers in the Chair. The serious part
of the business lies in the fearsome open-
ing up of possibilities. If some Members
of present House are to enjoy a dual
existence, when absent with their consti-
tuents are to be present in the House, life
at Westminster will not be worth living.
The influence of the epidemic is shewn
in the cose of DARLING, Q.C., alluded to.
He tells me that at ten minutes to seven
to-night he saw the Member for Sark
standing behind the SPEAKER'S chair
paring his nails,
"' As you are paring,' I said to him in
my genial way " (this an extract from DAR-
LING, Q.C.'s deposition), "'will you pair
with me for the dinner hour?'" "The

neth, "started, looked me straight in the
eyes, and went on cutting his nails, just
as CHARLOTTE, when WERTHER first saw
her, went on cutting bread and butter."
DARLING, Q.C., we all know as a man of
high probity, serious mind, profound legal
erudition, long familiarity with the laws of
evidence.

that the Member for Sark has not been in

exert your unbounded influence against
the spread of the terrible plapue known as
the Puzzle Picture Disease? The Acrostic
Fever was bad enough at its height, but
the present malevolent malady is assuredly
assuming deadly proportions, which will
drive many unassuming citizens, such as
myself, into those Asylums usually associ-
ated with permanent or temporary aberra-
tions of wit. I cannot take my walk at
home or abroad without some dame or
darnel, some adult or youth, producing
from her or his pocket a sheet of printed
paper covered with strange devices, and
inquiring whether I would kindly state
what well-known personage a lucifer match
in a donkey's mouth, or a balloon sailing
on the sea, or some equally idiotic delinea-
tion represents? Hating mysteries, picto-
rial or otherwise, I generally return evasive
answers, and the consequence is, that I
have broken off my approaching marriage
(booauso I could not inform my intended
bride what the Mephistophelean delineator
meant by a hippopotamus waltzing with a
ballot dancer). I have also been wiped out
of the will of my rich uncle (by reason that
I differed with him as to the signification
of a locomotive apparently running a race
with a giraffe) : and I have quarrelled with
my old chum, HAKRT HOGGINSON, in that,
quite in chaff, I gave him the correct defini-
tion of a cut showing a boa constrictor
consuming a cathedral, which solution he
did not use. I therefore beg to announce
that in future I shall be deaf to all in-
quiries so far as ladies are concerned, and
that if any one of my own sex torment
me, I shall give him an illustration of

AND have you not heard of the ruddy young slaughterman,
Who in our fiction his axe used to ply?
He handled its edge with such fiendish dexterity,
Sticking its "beak" in the enemy's eye.
He looked so fierce, and slew so steadily,
The foemen went down in his path so readily!
And he eyed the young braves with so awful an air
That this slaughterman always established a scare.
What sights of sheer bloodshed he managed when merry,
With "smelling out" witches his tale could appal;
He was always "so nice" with the Library ladies,
Who like something "bluggy" and "terribly tall."
Though oft-times the critics came carping and sneering,
'Twas all one to him their jibing or jeering;
For critical liking he little did care,
Whilst our slaughterman captured the youthful and fair.
And yet but to think, now, how strangely things happen,—
As he wrote along thinking of—nothing at all,
A change in the fashion came in without warning,
And "blugginess" found in the market a fall.
And would this young writer but banish his sorrow,
He must chuck up sheer gore, and try nature to-morrow.
For how will our ruddy young slaughterman fare,
If dropped by the young and tabooed by the fair?

THE ENDBAVOUB TO HAVE HIS TACKLE) QUITE THE BEST 8PORT OF THE SEASON WITH THE MAT-FLY.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
"WHEN I got the cholera it was three in the morning. I
thought I was dying. So I got up, went to my desk, and settled
all my worldly affairs, carried my last instructions to KEIB in her
bed, put on my clothes and went out to confession and commu-
nion." Here, in a couple of sentences, is indicated the man-
ner of living of the rare woman whose history is written in
The Eomance of Isabel Lady Burton (HuroniNSON & Co.), told
in part by herself, in part by W. H. WILKINS. The collaboration
supplies excellent reading, competing in interest with any ordi-
nary novel of the year. It is the story of a passionate-natured,
yet clear-headed, practical-minded woman, mated with one
of the oddest men of the century, a soldier of fortune,
whose inclination and duties called him to the remote
corners of the earth. My Baronite doubts whether BURTON
was quito such a god-like creature as he seemed to be
when the glistening eyes of his loving wife were turned upon
him. Amongst her other qualities Lady BURTON is a graphic
writer. Thanks to the discernment of Mr. WILKINS, who in
this and other respects has done his work admirably, we get bright
glimpses of Brazil. Portugal, Teneriffe, and other places now first
given to the world. As to her account of her visit to Madeira and
Teneriffe, Mr. WILKINS states that her husband would not allow
her to publish them. To have one BUETON in the book market
was probably enough for him, and the wife, as was her manner
in this and many analogous circumstances indicated in her story,
uncomplainingly submitted. "It was a habit with the BURTONS
all through tneir lives," Mr. WILKINS writes, "that whenever
they were leaving England for any length of time BUBTON started
first in light marching order to prospect the place, leaving his
wife behind to pay, pack, and bring up the heavy baggage in the
rear." An admirable arrangement—for the husband. In de-
velopment suitable to varied countries it is common to Oriental
races and the untutored savage. It seemed quite proper to the
unselfish nature of the woman, who, when she thought she
was dying of cholera, got out of bed, made things comfortable
for everyone else when she should have passed away, and then
went forth to pray for the repose of her own soul. To know
Lady BURTON as she stands revealed in this book is a privilege
calculated to make women proud, and man even humbler than
is his wont. THB BARON DK B.-W.

IN the garden I love of all pleasaunces best,
In the Paradise perfect of Kew,
Where the eye and the ear can for ever find rest,
Not the heart, I am thinking of you,
Of you as you were in the days that are dead
But not buried—they never can be
As long as I hold to the words that you said
When you plighted your troth here to me.
O! my dear little sweetheart, I cannot forget
How happy we were in that May.
Your portrait is garlanded, treasured and set
In a frame of that dear yesterday,
In a frame that was gilded by first Summer sun,
And adorned with all clustering bloom;
I have only that picture, my own, only one,
A miniature limned with perfume.
The soft golden rain of laburnum still sways
In the breeze as it did, dear, of old;
The lilac yet laughs in the sun's pointed rays
As it did when our story was told,
That story which sank in Life's tide like a stone
(E'en tne splash was but noticed by few),
But I 'm living the whole of that story alone

THE GAME OF ADVERBS.
(A COUNTRY-HOUSB TRAOI-COMEDY, IN TWO PARTS.)
PART I.
SCENE—The Drawing-room at Dripstone Manor, a stalely Jacobean 'man-
sion recently^acquired by Mr. JOSEPH SHUTTLEWORTH (of SHUTTLE-
WORTH AND CLACK, Carpet Manufacturers, Yarnminster). It is to-
wards dusk in early October. Mrs. SHUTTLEWOBTH, a plump, good-
humoured-looking matron of about fifty, is discovered with her chil-
dren, viz., GRACE, a rather prim, and precise young woman of twenty-
three; FLOSSIE, a pretty and lively girl of eighteen; CONNIE, twelve,
and COLIN, ten. With them are GILLIAN PINOENEY, a High School
friend of GRACE'S ; IVY GORING, a Boarding-school chum of FLOSSIE'S,
who are staying at the Manor; and the younger children's Governess,
Miss MARKHAM. Mr. SHDTTLEWORTH, fifty-five, florid and pros-
perous-looking, enters with his son BOB, twenty-one, of Eton and Cam-
bridge. Both are in shooting things.
Sob (sotto voce, to Miss GORINO). Never knew anyone who did.
But the poor old Governor is rather apt to draw his bow at a
venture.
Mrs. Shutt. I can't say I quite take to your friend Mr. DOB
MER, BOB. He has such a nasty sneering way with him.
Grace. He 's atrociously conceited. It he 's a type of the Ox-
ford Undergraduate, I prefer Cambridge.
Flossie. I'm certain he 's looking down on us secretly all the
time.
Bob. What bosh! You don't understand old DORMER, that's
a nailing good fellow. Capital company!

"Is Sirs. Shuttleworth at home, my good man r"
Mrs, Shuttleworth (to them). So you're back at last! I've
just sent away the tea. But if you 'd like some, I could easily -
Mr. Shutt. Not for me, LOUISA, thanks. BOB and I had some-
thing as we came through the dining-room. That Jack-o'-dandy
friend of BOB'S, DOHMER, may like a cup, though, for all I can
say
Mrs. Shutt.
But what's become of Mr. DORMER?
Mr. Shutt. Gone upstairs to titivate, I expect. Bless you,
iu wouldn't catch him coming in here in his shooting toecerv I

Sob. Fact is, Mater, the Governor's rather riled with DORMER
for saying on the way home that, on the whole, he thought the
safest thing to be was a pheasant,

Mr. Shutt. It's my belief he did

DORMEE didn't menu any-
And considering how con-
foundedly bad the light's been this afternoon, and that I never
took to shooting at all till late in life, I don't call myself a
particularly poor shot.
. , .
Mrs. Shutt. You said he would keep us all amused if he coulc
only be got to come. But so far, I can't say —
Bob. Well, Mater, after being at the same house at Eton with
him, I ought to know. And all I can tell vou is. that he was far
and away the best mimic I ever heard. He could imitate every-
body and everything.
Flossie. Up to now he has only favoured us with an imitation
of a disagreeable stuck-up pig. It's life-like — but still it is
beginning to pall. (She starts as DORMER lounges in; he has
d™s*?d for dinner, except that he is wearing a black smoking-coat .)
Oh, Mr. DORMER, you did startle me so! You look exactly like
a curate.
Dormer. And are curates such alarming objects? But you 're
all in the dark, here.
Flossie. Yes. We thought you would come in and be brilliant.
Dormer. I 'm afraid I can't compete with the ordinary methods
of illumination. (To himself.) Wish this girl would" see that
I m not in the humour for this sort of thing.
Mr. Shvtt. (to himself). Can't do with this young fellow!
(Aloud, to his wife.) I 'm off to my study, LOUISA. Got some
letters to write. [Be goes ouf,
Dormer (to himself) . On the sofa — with his eyes shut! Only
wish I could slip out, too — but they might think "it rather casual.
(Aloud, to FLOSSIE.) You haven't told me why you charged me
with looking clerical? Can't say I feel complimented.
Flossie. Oh, it doesn't go any deeper than a buttoned-up coat
and white tie. And you might have a worse compliment than
being compared to a clergyman!
Mrs. Shutt. Talking of clergymen, my dear, that reminds me
the Rector has never called yet. Considering we have been
here six weeks, and attended church regularly every Sunday
morning, I do think he might have found time to return the
civility before this I
Dormer. If it was the Rector I had the privilege to hear last
Sunday, impressing upon us the duty of cheerfulness in sepulchral
tones that were calculated to draw howls from a china poodle, I
should be inclined to think myself that the gaiety of tie party
has not suffered appreciably from his delay.
Mrs. Shutt. Mr. POLYBLANK'S pulpit manner is a little melan-
choly, certainly — he's a bachelor, poor man. But they tell me
he 's very much looked up to; comes of a very good family, and
intimate with all the county folk, so perhaps he doesn't consider
us good enough for him.
Grace. Really, Mamma, you talk as if we were Pariahs 1 Most
of the county people round here have called on us. What does
it matter if Mr. POLYBLANK chooses to stay away?
Mrs. Shutt. All the same, my dear, there's a sort of natural
tie between the Rectory and the Manor which — not that I 'm one
to force my acquaintance on anybody. Still he might give us
credit for not being downright savages, if we do come from
Yarnminster!
Flossie. There, Mother dear, that's enough of the Reverend
POLY. I vote we have a game at something. Are you fond of
games, Mr. DORMER?
Dormer. Indoor games? Er — not immoderately. The mere
fact of being supplied with a slip of paper and a stumpy pencil,
and required to compile a list of animals beginning with A,
paralyses my faculties. I assure you I never can produce a single
animal beginning with A.
Flossie (with intention). Not even one? But it 's too dark to
see to write. We might have a guessing game — where somebody
has to go out of the room, you know.
Dormer. Ah. I think I could play at that.
Flossie. And when you come back, you have to guess from our
questions what celebrated historical person you 're supposed to be.
Dormer. I should never get within a mile of it. I 've forgotten
my I/ittle Henry's History of England ages ago.
Miss Markham (in a small, thin voice). There 's a most amusing
guessing game called " Adverbs."
Dormer. It sounds perfectly delightful. Only I'm afraid that
I 've only the sketchiest idea of what sort of thing an adverb is.
Miss Mark. Surely you know that! It's a part of speech,
formed by adding the termination "ly" to an adjective. For
instance: bad — badlv -

One of the party goes out; and the rest agree in what manner
they are all to receive him when he returns—" admiringly,"
"affectionately," and so on.
Dormer. And he comes in pretending he 's somebody else?
Miss Mark. He can if he chooses, of course. But all he need
do is to ask questions all round, and from the way in which they
are answered he guesses what the adverb is. Now do you see,
Mr. DOKMEKP
Dormer. I think I have grasped the idea. I don't mind volun-
teering to go out of the room, at all events.
Orace. Very well. You go out, Mr. DORMER, and just wait
about in the hall till we call you in.
Dormer. Delighted. (To himself, as he goes out.) It's just
possible I may be a little hard of hearing.
Flossie (after he has closed the door). Now, what adverb shall
it be? Do let's make it something difficult!
Miss Pinceney. Why not something which would let us show
him what we think of him—" Candidly " ?" Contemptuously "?

he can be!

We could be rude without being personal.

game. "Rudely" will do first rate. I '11 call him in.

END OF PART I.
INTERVIEWS WITH INANIMATE OBJECTS.
A MATINEE HAT.
I MANAGED to get hold of it when it was off duty, so to speak,
and at once broached a most delicate subject.
"What do you think of the recent legislation in America (New
York, isn't it ?) abolishing the matinee hat P"
"It is only one other instance of the supreme folly which crops
up at times in whole sections of the human race. Nations, like
individuals, occasionally lose their heads. But what can you
expect from a people which has rejected the Arbitration Treaty P"
I can quite understand your wounded feelings, but are you
not sometimes an obstruction P Is there nothing to be said for
the point of view—literally the point of view—of those who
wish to see the play when they go to the theatre?"
"There are none such! Matinee going is a social function, in
which the 'play' is of no more importance than is the irusk-al
accompaniment to conversation in a fashionable drawing-room."
"That is a hard doctrine Wly, then, should all men clamour
for your destruction, if they have no real wish to see the
performance?"
"My poor friend, are you indeed so dull of comprehension?

WORTH KNOWING.
It is through nothing else in the wide world but pure inalousy 1
The agitation would cease to-morrow, if men were allowed to
wear such elegant productions aa myself. Indeed, I have ccme
to the conclusion that this would be the true solution of the
difficulty. Design a superb matinee hat for the men, and they
would at once be perfectly happy."
''You take my breath away.
"Allow me to continue. I cannot altogether blame the un-
fair sex for their jealous feelings; they are much to be pitied,
with their ugly stove-pipe hats. Let but the Prince of WALES
set the fashion of wearing a miniature flower-garden on his head,
and it would be eagerly followed."
"The head?"
"No, tie fashion."
"Yet I do not gather that artists are prepared to worship the
matinee hat as a type of beauty. How is that?"
"The same answer holds good—jealousy. They have no rever-
ence for anything that is not an oil-painting. England will never
be truly great till the Royal Academy does its duty and opens a
section for artistic hats; and possibly bonnets. I can conjure up
hitherto unimagined heights and depths of loveliness—symphonies
in silks and satins, and glorious visions of vegetables and flowers,
contrasting with the gleaming, waving trophies of ostrich, hum-
ming-bird, and egret. RUDYARD KIPLING might be engaged to
celebrate each exhibit in incisive verse. But there are other
poets beside RUDYARD KIPLIXO.
A feather, a wire, and a itack of straw.
How does that strike you for a neat epigrammatic description f"
"Do you approve of the slaughter of birds for personal adorn-
ment? I am truly grieved if such is the case."
"Nonsense! You should not indulge in silly sentiment. What
is a heron or a kingfisher compared to a HAT P"
How could I reply?

Oiaour.")
[" The Greek Army has fallen back on Thermo-
pylae."—Tiinei.]
Ciaut of the unforgotten brave I
Whose land from plain to mouiitain-cave
Seems Freedom's tomb and Glory's
gravel
Scene of skedaddling! Can it be
That this is all remains of thee?
Approach, O, Islam's beaten slave;
Say, is this your Thermopylae?
What shall your hosts from KIHIKM eave,
O, funky offspring of the Free?
Pronounce what sea, what shore is this.
Can it be rock-bound Salamis?
Yours shall not be a name, I fear,
That Tyranny shall quake to hear;
But rather one whose bitter fame
Your sons will mark with shrinking shame,
from Freedom's fight to cut and run
Must shame the sire before the sou.
It is not thus that Freedom's won!
And yet, perchance, on History's page,
In records of this "Golden" Age
(For Mammon is our modern Mage),
Facts now in dusky darkness hid
Beneath the diplomatic lid,
Will light a bit this sordid gloom,
Where "heroes" bolt, and despots
"boom ":
Will show how nigh-placed Hidden Hand
Pulled wires which baulked an ancient
land;
That there is more than meets the eye
In all this piteous puppetry.
'Twere long to tell, and hard to trace,
Each step in Greece's dire disgrace.
Enough—the SULTAN'S hordes can quell
Thermopylae's hosts; and who shall tell
What 'twas that paved abasement's way,
Or Mammon's bonds or despot sway P

A SUGGESTION.
JUBILEE WINDOW, AS DESIGNED AND ARRANGED BY MRS. FELICIA MANYTWIOG.
SPORTIVE SONGS.
A Country man laments to his London bride on
the iniquity of the House Sparrow.
IN Springtime, when the sparrows build,
Oh ! then my heart gets sadder;
I know it means my gutters filled
With nests that need a ladder!
The sparrow eats our budding peas
In manner quite illegal,
But slug and snail leaves to their ease—
I wish he were an eagle!
For then, mayhap, he 'a scare the cats
Who desecrate our roses,
Or decimate the ghoulish bats
That flit about our noses.
An eagle lodg'd beneath the eaves
The farmer's lambs might harrow,
But would not stoop to strip his sheaves,
As does that beastly sparrow.
He always wakes me up at five,
A noisy, tuneless suitor;
Upon our grain he seems to thrivs,
An unabashed freebooter.
In short, he is the curse of May—
Don't think my views too narrow—
The dodo long has passed away;
Won't some day, too, the sparrow?
I do not wish to chide the zeal
That causes you to scatter
Big chunks of bread at every meal,
Responsive to his chatter.
You say he Childhood's days recalls,
When you were wont to feed him,
But far from Mayfair's stuccoed halls,
Do you still, darling, need him 'f
The blackbird, thrush, and nightingale,
Are fain to hymn you daily;
The robin, linnet, larkt ne'er fail
To warble to you gaily.
So pray give up your cockney friend,
He suits not plough and harrow,
And grant me leave to make an end
Of each confounded sparrow!

"I 'EAR THIS 'ERK PATTI AIN'T 'ASF BAD!'
OPEEATIC NOTES.
Covent Garden Opera. Wednesday,
May 19.—To-night, a matter of Bizet-
ness, i.e., Carmen. Firstoate house to
welcome Mile. ZELIB DB LUSSAN, the very
Carmenest of all Carmens. As good as
ever she was. M. SALIGNAO, the new Don
Jose, rather quiet at first, but coming out
strong, vocally and dramatically, at the
finish. Signer ANCONA is a robustious
Escamillo; but, alas I the freshness of the
Toreador contento has departed, and an
audience can now hear it unmoved.
Couldn't have a fitter name for a low
comedian taking the part of II Bemendado
than M. ROMMY. Missed the former and
much Rumrnier than the Rommi-Remen-
dado, to .whom audience had become ac-
customed. MAIHK ENQLH charming as the
tender-hearted, lieht-headed MIOAELA. Of
course, no contraband company perfect
without Mile. BATORMEisTER-singer as
Frisky Frasquita, one of the card-sharp-
ing gipsy maidens. M. FLON conducted,
and all went well. Chorus, "Flon, Flon,
Flon I " ad lib.
Friday.—MASSENET'S Haiivn. Always
delightful, because we haven't had too
much of it. M. VAN DTOK suddenly in-
disposed, so M. BONNABD nobly stands up
for his absent friend, and takes his part.
To say that M. BONNAKD looks the Cheva-
lier des Grie-ux is complimentary to his
artistic talent; but there never was such
a hopelass milksop as Des Grieux, or such
an old humbug of a sermoniser (with a
song) as his father the Count, excellently
played by M. PLANOON.
M. DTJFRANE comes out well as that light
comedy rascal, Lescaut, and Madame SA-
VIM.K gains all hearts and hands by her
representation of Manon Lescawt, though
she makes her too much of a "real lady"
to be quite in keeping with the character
of that sly little heroine. House filled
up well after 8.30, but before that hour
dinner must be attended to.
What everyone with dramatic instinct
must admire to-night is the admirable
stage management I Take, for example,
the scene where, when it is growing dark,
three candles are brought in to illuminate
a snug apartment (for two) the width
and height of Covent Garden stage; and
when Dei Grieux has to read a letter,
what does he do? Does he walk up to
one of these candles, and avail himself of
ita assistance P Not a bit of it; nothing so
commonplace. Accompanied by the crafty
Chevalier, who always wants to keep him
in the dark, Dei Grieux walks away from
the candles and up to the window at the
back, where there isn't even a ray of
moonlight, and there, by the light of his
own unaided intelligence, he reads the
letter. Then, how touching is Marion's
sweet farewell to the big soup tureen and
the bottle of cheap claret which her lover,
regardless of expense, has ordered in for
their supper,—a meal they never take,
and which is left untasted when the
curtain descends, in spite of the lover's
festive "A table! A tablet" The opera
to-night abounds in these little touches.
Finally, as no opera here can be considered
quite complete in its cast without Mile.
BAUERMEIBTEB, here she is as the pretty
little puss Poussette, a companion picture,
in court dress, to her FrasqvAta in Carmen.
FLON conducted the orchestra, and him-
self, admirably.
Saturday. — A grand LOHBNORIN-DB-
RBSZKE night to end the week. Nothing
risky about the Reszkys.
A PARIS IMPROMPTU.
[The much-discussed tramway across the Champs
Klyfiers has just been opened.]
'Tis the eighteenth of May,
And a noteworthy day
For the Champs Elysees.
At the Rond Point I stay,
And just over the way,
From my room I survey

All in faultless array,
And an endless display
Of snobisme outre,
Epatant and blast,
Of cocottes and eochers,
And the jeunesse doree.

'Tis a perilous play,
And the diable to pay,
If the thing runs away,
With a snort and a bray,

As they mean to make hay
While they see the sun's ray
Through the sky too long grey.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED PROM THE DIART OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, May 17.—
Curious how soon and how completely
House forgets old Members, whether small
or great. There was a time when it
seemed impossible to carry on without
Mr. G. He has been gone these two
years, and the SPEAKER takes the chair as
usual, the Clerk proceeds to read the
Orders of the Day, speeches are made, divi-
sions taken, as if Mr. G. had never been.
For quite other reasons it seemed im-
possible to forget CHARLES AUGTTSTTJS VAN-
8ITTART CONYBEARE: "the CURSE OF CAM-
BORNE," SARK, for brevity, used to call
him. His strident voice, his forbidding
manner, his habit of opposing everything
at interminable length, made such sharp
impression npon a long-suffering House
that, released from his presence, Members
might be expected to have abiding sense
of deliverance. But the CURSE OF CAM-
BORNE withdrawn, the House is absolutely
indifferent.
Reminded of blessing to-night by hear-

ing a voice, evidently made in Germany,
discoursing on Employers' Liability Bill.
Who is it? Members ask. It's STRAUSS,
who, at the General Election, beat CONT-
BEARE out of Camborne.
"And a very good thing, too," says
PRINCE ARTBTDB, in high spirits to-night,
since SQTTRK OF MALWOOD has come back
hale and strong. "Apart from that claim
upon the favour of the House, the new
Member will be of invaluable service to us.
It is something to know that we can
always put up STRAUSS when we want to
know which way the wind blows."
Business dnne.—Useful, but not precisely
alluring, debate around Employers' Lia-
bility Bill.
Tuesday. — Young Members will do
well to study the manner of the Member
for the Kingston division of Surrey when
putting a question to a Minister. There
are various ways of doing this, from
FORTESCTJE-FLANNERY'S portentous mouth-
ing of unimportant syllables to Mr. WETR'R
laconic but impressive "Question 42."
SKKWES-COX has an insinuating, self-de-
precating manner that is irresistible. As

side, he seams to say, "Really, I do hope
that of your infinite kindness you will be
able to 'Scuse-Cox."
Of course no one, least of all WHITE
RIDLEY, can refuse the request. Accord-
ingly, when to-night Member for Kingston
apologetically introduced the topic of
gipsies and other vagrom men, dwellers in
tents and vans, the HOME SECRETARY made
conciliatory reply.
There the matter might have ended,
and SWIFT MACNBILL now wishes it had.
Thought he saw opportunity of scoring off
Members opposite. HOME SECRETARY had
said, that under existing statutes local au-
thorities are enabled to deal with nuisances
caused by dwellers in tents and vans.
"Do those powers apply to persons in
Primrose League Vans?" asked SWIFT
MACNEILL; and good Liberals chuckled.
"They apply only to persons who be-
come nuisances," answered the HOME SEC-
RETARY, in emphatic voice, with significant
nod towards his interlocutor. House the
more delighted since WHITE RIDLEY doesn't
look the kind of man to say such things.
MACNEILL thinks he will leave him alone
in future.
Business done.—Employers' Liability Bill
read second time.
Thursday. — Pretty to see the Right
Hon. JEREMIAH LOWTHER standing just
now between Chancellors of the Exche-
quer, past and present, Lamenting their
perverseness. Motion made to read Bud-
get Bill a second time. This JEREMIAH
met with amendment which, apart from
politics, is a gem of literary construction.
That in the opinion of this House," so
the verse ran, "the existing fiscal system
of the country is unequal to the con-
tinually increasing demands of the public
service, and that the time has arrived ior
recourse to be had to more varied sources
of taxation."

THE JUBILEE PREPARATIONS.
Unsophisticated Colonial Visitor. "WHAT BUILDING IB THAT, DRIVER?"
Driver. "WHY, BLEBS YE, SIB, THAT'S ST. PAUL'S!"
U. C. V. "INDEED! THEN ARE THEY TAKING IT DOWN TO BUILD SEATS FOR THE
JUBILEE PROCESSION?"
Observe the fine antique flavour of that
last sentence. It is Mr. Micawber in his
severer, more classic mood. What JERE-
MIAH meant, as he p|ainly set forth in a
chapter of Lamentations which occupied
just an hour in the reading, is that a five
shilling duty shall be clapped on corn.
Some people would have said so. JERE-
MIAH, looking round congregation with a
face whose supernal gravity is threatened
by a smile lurking in the corners of the
humourous mouth, lifts up his voice and
cries aloud, "The time has arrived for re-
course being had to more varied sources of
taxation."
Very few Members present. Even the
Budget Bill debate, opened by our own
JEREMIAH, is not a prospect that will draw
Members. But ST. MICHAEL was there, in
the absence of All Angels sitting alone on
th« Treasury Bench as on a cloud. Oppo-
site him, in full view of JEREMIAH, was the
SQUIRE OP MALWOOD, softly smiling at the
heresies proclaimed. JEREMIAH did not
lament the absence of a thronged audience
since these two were within hearing. If
only he could overcome what he called
their prejudices, all would be well with his
beloved country. The last years of a long
reign would spring into birth glowing in the
dawn of unexampled prosperity. So JERE-
MIAH, with ona eye on the SQUIRE OF
MALWOOD, and the other on the saintly
MICHAEL, improved the occasion, heedless
of the knowing smiles the eminent finan-
ciers flashed at each other across the table.
Some question arisen as to what subject
shall serve for fresco in one of the vacant
corners of the outer lobby. Surely here it
is to hand JBMMY LOWTHER standing be-
tween HICKS BEACH and HARCOUHT, trying
to convince them of the equity of a five
shilling duty on foreign corn.
Business done. — Education Bill read
third time; Budget Bill second time.
Flowing tide evidently with Ministers.
Friday.—JOHN AIRD, whose large heart
and generous mind care for the meanest
creatures among us, has turned his
thoughts upon the lot of the statues on
the line of the Jubilee Procession. Whilst
London is gay with bunting, streets and
houses filled with crowd dressed all in their
best, the statues remain in all their for-
bidding grime. Why not give them all a
wash and brush up, even if it costs more
than the statutory twopence? Has
brought the matter under notice of FIRST
COMMISSIONER OF WORKS. Few men can
resist JOHN AIRD'S genial manner. To-
night AKF.RS-DOTJGLAS announces that the
thing shall be done. JOHN beaming with
delight.
"I don't mind telling you, TOBY," he
whispered in my ear, "that if DOUGLAS
had, as some more hide-bound First Com-
missioners would have done, refused to
listen to the suggestion, I meant to take
off my coat and carry it out myself. Been
used to hard work all my life, though you
wouldn't think it to look at me. What
with an hour or two in the early morning,
and taking advantage of moonlight nights,
I would have made the statues look so that
they wouldn't know each other. But, of
course, it's better for the Board of Works
to turn on a lot of men. Get the washing
done more thoroughly."
"And when you've washed and nicely
AIHD them, I wish," sa.id SARK, "you
would Consider the desirability of mangling
a few."
"I think not," says JOHN, almost
severely for him. (He doesn't like SARK;
thinks he makes fun of people.) "Best to
do one thing at a time, and do it tho-
roughly."
Business done.—PRINCE ARTHUR, in
speech of rare excellence, announces
scheme of Local Government for Ireland,
gilded by equivalent grant in relief of
rates. "If PRINCE ARTHUR wants a motto
for his new Bill," said TIM HEALY, who is
as well up in the poets as he is in Parlia-
mentary practice, "he '11 find in WORDS-

And is EADYTH BEAUTY C. going to have the seat to herself in
the centre of all things, leaving the one or more young ladies

THE END.
"CHUKCH AND STAGE."
MY DEAR MR. PUNCH,—For years I have taken the greatest
interest in this subject, and am so delighted to see that at last
we have a notable composer of comic oratorios and serious operas
—no, I beg pardon, I meant t'other way about, composer of
serious oratorios and of comic operas—(I am not sure whether
he has done more than one of the former, but this is a detail)
—writing a Jubilee Ballet for the Alhambra to a scenario by a
Signor CARLO COPPI (this name as pronounced Englishly is not
suggestive of much originality), and at the same time composing
a hymn-tune for the Diamond Jubilee Service to words written
by the Bishop of Wakefield, a diocese ever memorable because of
ita immortal Goldsmithian Vicar. But why didn't these two
forces combine before? Why didn't the Bishop write the ballet,
for which Sir ARTHUR could have supplied the music, and then
the composer would not have had to seek abroad for a foreigner
to invent what was intended to be pre-eminently English, with
lots of Rule Britannia, Oirls I left behind me with British Grena-
diers, and all sorts of popular national melodies so mixed up in
it as to leave but comparatively little space for the composer's
own charming and original work. Let us hope that soon, re-
membering the success of the Vicar so capitally played by the
Rev. Mr. BARRINOTON in The Sorcerer, we may look forward to
a Ballet of Bishops with the most graceful pastoral music from
the Sullivanian pen. At last there is a chance of union between

A POPULAR ACTRESS IN TWO PIECES.
An Optical Delusion seen in the Strand, and due
to l/te fashionable Bolero Costume.
DARBY JONES ON THE DERBY.
HONOURED SIR,—I trust that you, with
other sagacious clients, plunked savings on
Victor Wild for the Jubilee Stakes at
Kempton, tor at 6 to 1 for a shop he
should have provided many loyal and de-
serving with the wherewithal to procure
windows whence to view the Commemo-
ration Progress of Her Most Gracious
Majesty the QUEEN. I regret to say that,
from the sporting point of view, the Dia-
mond Jubilee Derby is not likely to vie
with the Procession aforesaid. In Little
Doctor l''aust, the light work of the late
lamented BYRON (the dramatist and actor,
not the peer and Phil-Hellene), there was
a catching chorus, " We should ne'er for-
get the days when we were young." Pro-
bably on. account of the beauty of the
ladies, who delivered the sentiment musi-
cally and trippingly, the refrain was very
well liked by the most "dosey" fre-
quenters of the Gaiety Theatre, young
bloods who, then nurtured on chicken and
champagne, are now reduced to the
humble half-and-half, and the vulgar, but
nutritious, beef a la mode. With your
lightning-like habit of detecting bad florins,
you will naturally ask, Sir, "What on
earth has this to do with the Derby p"
Ready for your not unjustifiable attack,
I reply, "Because one of the dainty dam-
sels who did justice to the ditty in ques-
tion, induced me at Epsom in 1876 to
become her commissioner to the extent of
five indisputable sovereigns on the chances
of Kisber. As you are well aware, Mr.

But cui bono, as the Bard hath it? Suffice
ib to say I shall never "forget the days
when we were young." Derby Day always
recalls extraordinary experiences. I once
had a cousin, a hopeless ne'er-do-weel, who
was from time to time expatriated to
British Columbia, or West Australia, or
Texas, or the West Coast of Africa, pro-
vided with a brand new outfit, red flannel
shirts, white duck trousers, and a com-
fortable cheque. But he always turned
up at Epsom on Derby Day, and then he
was subscribed for again. 1 also knew a
man who went to the Derby with the sole
object of seeing a dead-heat. He nevei
wagered a copper on tha race. In 1884,
when Mr. HAMMOND'S St. Gatien and Sir
JOHN WILLOUGHBY'S Harvester accom-
plished the trick, my poor friend was laid
up in bed. He never recovered the shock,
so his housekeeper told me. Anyhow, ht
withdrew from this World a few weel^
afterwards. I was also acquainted with a
Great Lady—quite understand, Sir, as a
nebulous satellite. She was accustomed to
dream about races—some ladies are—and
in the Jubilee Year of 1887, she had a
vision that Merry Hampton would win the
Derby. She implored her husband to
mortgage his property in order to back
Mr. "ABINGTON'S" candidate. But her
spouse was callous, and refused to entrust
the animal with even so much as half-a-
crown. The result of the race led, I am
sorry to say, to separation for life between
the Dreamstress and her mate. Again, 1
never plant my boot on the Downs with-
out recalling the query of a famous Re-
veller of the Tom and Jerry days, "How
many four-year-olds have been returned
winners of the Derby?" Incarceration in
one of the QUEEN'S Compulsory Hotels
would suit neither you, honoured Sir, nor
me, so I refrain from transcribing the Re-
veller's answer to his own question. But
away with the Past. Let the Muse speak of
the Future! There will be a very small
field, unlikely to get into double figures
like a moderate cricketer. Well satisfied
as to the peril of his position, the Bard
delivers himself as follows: —
It seems a gift for Kendal's Son,
Yet I prefer the Painter.
The Yankee chance is not quite done,
The Frtnehman't hope is fainter.
Historic Tale will not prevail,
Nor yet an Ardent rush;
A Shiver we can scarcely hail,
But if the Favourite should run stale,
Look out for Joieey'i Brush.
Trusting to meet you on the Hill, where
the asparagus, the lobster, the salmon, the
prawn, and the quail mingle so refresh-
ingly together about the Fountains of the

AGAIN—and if possible, more popular than
ever. The opening day was a success; but
the show was too long, apd the repetitions
were wearisome, except, perhaps, to those
insatiable Olivers who are always asking
for more. Captain DANN of the stentorian
voice, who towards the end of the fort-
night always qualifies himself for a Hoarse
Guardsman, is there to be seen and heard.
As he enters, the band ought to play
"Roary O'Moore," as he is quite the Dan
de Lion of the exhibition. But 'tis a far

A QUESTION WHICH MIGHT BE ASKED (IF
NOT ANSWERED) IN PARLIAMENT.—In view
of the danger which the National Collec-
tions at South Kensington run from risk
of fire, what are the Commissioners of the
International Exhibitions of 1851 and 1862
doing with the income derived from the
property in their charge? Perhaps de-
voting the money to the extinction of
rabbits in Australia, or the exploration of
the South Pole.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THB DIARY or TOBY, M.P
House of Commons, Monday, May 24.—
WILLIAM EDWARD MURRAY TOMLINSON
faith in mankind has received painfu
shock. He has been wounded in th
house of a friend. Came down to-nigh
brimful of pleasant little surprise for Com
mittee on Employers' Liability Bill. Mem
bers having observed the firmness an
dexterity with which SPEAKER disposed o
nine out of ten Instructions, settled dow
in Committee, prepared to discuss innn
merable procession of amendments. Firs
on paper stood in name of NTTSSEY. H
rose to full height with intent to move i
when an even more commanding figure
was discovered on its feet to the right o
the Chair.
"Mr. LOWTHER, Sir," said a voice, anu
the Committee recognised the Statesman
who shares with Corporal HANBTJBY the
representation of Preston. "I beg leave to
move that you report progress, and as!
leave to sit again."
The Chairman, half turning his head
and catching a glimpse of TOMLINSON, said
something that sounded uncommonly like
"Tut! tut!" and oalled on NUSSEY to
proceed.
At the moment WILLIAM EDWARD Mtm
RAY was engaged in the delicate task o
extracting from his breast pocket the notes
of a luminous speech. All very well for
minor Members to discuss pettifogging
amendments. TOMLINSON would deal with
the question as a whole. On the motion
to report progress ha would view the situa-
tion from every avenue; would convince

out the opening page, W. E. M. T. became
conscious of the fact that there was an-
other Member on his legs. Nearly oppo-
site him was NUSSEY saying something in
stentorian tones.
This distinctly out of order. Only on
Member may be on his feet at a give
moment. And hadn't he, the many
initialled TOMLINSON, moved to report pro
gress P
He remained standing, regarding Chair
man with look of dignified inquiry
NUSSEY went on. There were cries
"Order! Order!" "Ha-ha!" though
WILLIAM EDWARD, "they are shoutin
NUSSEY down." The cries rose in volume
attention seemed strangely directed to
wards him (W. E. M. T.) ;he was consciou
of someone pulling at his coat-tails. The
Chairman turned his head, and wit
peremptory wave of arm ordered him
(TOMLINSON, W. E. M.) to resume hi
seat!
Slowly, even though assisted by th
;entleman attached to his coa^tail, T
Iropped into his seat. Gradually trui
dawned upon him. Chairman regarding
his action as frivolous—fancy TOMLINSOI
frivolous!—had declined to hear him.
"This," said WILLIAM EDWARD, hoarsely
when he had partially recovered, "comes o
household suffrage, free education, and the
admission of women to the Terrace a
tea time."
Business done.—Employers' Liability Bil
n Conlmittee.
Tuesday.—Quite affecting air of injuret
innocence about SAGE OF QUEEN ANNE'S
JATB as he took his seat to-night. The
ynx-eye of JEREMIAH LOWTHER has dis-
cerned in him the victim of a breach o:
jrivilege. The SAGE been "saying things'
ibout Dr. HARRIS, and his colleagues on
•South Africa Committee have censurec
lim. JEREMIAH finds new food for
lamentation in this procedure. Has
opked up the authorities; finds that
rifle over a couple of centuries ago House
ordered that in such circumstances Com-
mittee should report to it, not presume to
act on its own authority. Action by Com-
mittee re the SAGE clearly a breach of
'rivilege. Meant to raise it last night;
ust missed opportunity. Not to be done
gain that way. So this evening, ques-
ions on paper over, JEREMIAH in corner
eat below Gangway bobs up and down
ike a middle-aged cork on troubled water.
When at length SPEAKER calls on him,
is judicial manner almost appalling in its
ntensity. Understand now how it once
wed the Jockey Club. SARK says he
ould give anything to see JEREMIAH in
udge's wig and gown. Will cheerfully
lump down his guinea if subscription be
ot up to present him with one. The
pectacle of LOWTHER (J.) thus arrayed,
seated below Gangway, would invest that
wless part of House with much-needed
ignity. As it is, by sheer force of charac-
er and sense of situation, JEREMIAH suc-
jeds without adventitious circumstances
f wig and gown. Sublime the tone and
lanner with which he remarked, "I would
eaire to call your attention to the resolu-
"on passed on March 16, 1688." Some

rivolous Members laughed. House gece-
•ally felt older, wiser, in closer touch with
istoric England. As for SAGE OP QUEEN
.NNE'S GATE, he blushed to find the Cen-
iries marshalled on his behalf, as in
ourt counsel call witnesses to character.
LOWTHER (J.) not the kind of man to
mar magnificent generalities with mere
articulars. House crowded in expecta-
tion of piquant discussion of the SAGE'S
indiscretion, and the South Africa Com-
mittee's irregularity. "I bring forward no
particular instance or case," said his Lud-
ship. Gathering imaginary robes round
his statuesque figure, he resumed his seat.

Mr. Justice (Jimmy) L-wth-r.
Thereupon House went into Committee
on the Employers' Liability Bill.
Business done.—Not very much.
Thursday. — Grubbing away at Em-
ployers' Liability Bill. Debate excellent;
only occasionally exciting. This happens
on such points as whether a workman wil-
ully at default shsll obtain compensation;
nd whether the parties may contract out.
)ON JOSE, who looks after the HOME
SECRETARY and the Bill, offers compro-
mise. Then Members on one side or other
ear their hair, rend their clothes, get
rfr. PRIM to send in a few ashes, on which
hey sit, and declare "All is Lost."
DON JOSE says, "No such thing. The
roposed amendment to the amendment to
he proposed amendment as amended is
lot nearly so bad (or so good) as the hon.
dember thinks."
Thereupon the bereaved gets up, combs
ut what is left of his hair, mends his
lothes, gets the ashes swept away, re-
umes his seat as if nothing had happened.
All this, of course, in a Parliamentary
ense. But it's about the sort of thing
tre suffer through the week.
Business done. — Employers' Liability
'ill in Committee.
Friday. — ROBERT ARTHUR WARD, the
o-called Member for Crewe, really has set
ut for the Cape. SABK saw him off at
outhampton, after vain endeavour to in-
uce him to stay and deliver his promised
laiden speech in Committee on the Em-
loyers' Liability Bill.

T. R. ADELPHI, U.S.A., STRAND.
Secret Service, at the Adelphi, is a melo-
drama that ought to have come to stop, or
rather to run. But unless some arrange-
ment is arrived at, this capital specimen of
American authorship and acting is to leave
us before it has attained the xenith of its
success in this year of Jubilee I It is in
four acts, but so constructed that a visi-
tor coming in late, say, after the first half
was over, would bp quite satisfied with the
second half. A character who, whether in
military or civil capacity, is generally con-
sidered as an unprincipled scoundrel, i.e.,
a spy, is here made the hero of the drama,
worthy of the love of the chillingly vir-
tuous heroine. His one good act is to
yield to the request of this young lady,
who implores him for her sake, and be-
cause she has done him th<- simple service
of saving his life, to refrain from wiring
false intelligence to Head quarters. In a
moment of virtuous weakness he consents.
The misleading information is not sent.
No one is hurt, and after very nearly ex-
piating the intended crime by forfeiting
his life, he is at the last moment let off,
though sentenced, by a remarkably hearty
old general with a stronger American ac-
cent than any other actor in the piece, to
remain a close prisoner until the war is
over.
It is all most exciting from first to last,
and the light comedy relief is admirably
given by Miss ODETTE TYLER, as Caroline
Mitford, and Mr. HBNRT WOODRUFF, as
Wilfred Varney, a surname that recalls
SCOTT and Kenihoorth. The two negro
house-servants, played by Miss ALICE
LEIQH and Mr. H. D. JAMES, give real
colour to the piece. The villain, Mr.
CAJIPBBLL GOLLAN, would be even more vil-
lainous than he is, bad he not elected to
make up after PHIZ'S well-known figure of
Nicholas Nickleby, with the addition of
moustachios; and, on consideration, in the
moustachios lies all the villainy of what
would otherwise be a very pleasant and
amiable countenance. It is Nicholas
Nicldeby with the moustache of Lord
Feri-sopht, in the spme novel; and it is a
Nicholas who would, at very first sight,
have won the heart of that thorough-going
old theatrical manager, Mr. Vincent
Crummies. In case the play should not
return, or the thread of its present exist-
ence be snicked by the advent of SARAH
BERNHARDT, strongly does this deponent
advise all who can enjoy such a flavour-
some dish as is this melodrama, with
American spice, to see it ere it quits the
Adelphi.

DEAR SIR,—I was glad to see that you

HOW TO SEE THE PROCESSION.
(By One who has Thought it out.)
OF course, you must be out early. As
the traffic will be stopped soon in the
morning, you must rise betimes. Perhaps,
to insure this, you had better not go to
bed overnight; then you are sure to be
ready by dawn.
Say that you want to get to a window in
Piccadilly. Of course, if you insist you
don't, it upsets the calculation. Well, if
you live south of Buckingham Palace Road,
your best way is by the Embankment, over
Hammersmith Bridge, and then by easy
stages to Hyde Park Corner. Once there,
all you have to do is to send for a
balloon.
If you wish to get to the Strand, and
live at Brixton, you can start early, and
find your way to Victoria Station. Now
you will have to cross the line of route at
Westminster. As this may be difficult,
you should make friends with the autho-
rities, and mount either the Clock Tower
or the roof of Westminster Abbey. If this
fails, you may get a "Cannon King " from
the nearest theatre of varieties, and ask
him to shoot you from his gun to your
place of destination.
But perhaps the best way of all to see
the object of your search is to miss the
present Jubilee, and wait for the proces-
sion in the next.

LITERARY RECIPES.
(From Our Oien "Authors' Cooktry-Book.")
The Komance.-—-This dish is very popular just now. Take the
language, manners and costumes of the last three centuries, and
mix them thoroughly. Having stirred well, drop in a hero of
superhuman strength, a fresh young titled heroine, and the
blackest villain obtainable, and when this mixture begins to
simmer, add six murders, two suicides, and three elopements.
Garnish with illustrations, and serve up in a volume of five
hundred pages.
The Society Novel.—Select half-a-dozen well-known persons,
and give them transparent pseudonyms. Add a liberal portion
of sauce pi<?uante, compounded of malicious gossip, cynical
aphorisms, and fashionable slang, and the dish will then be com-
plete. Some authorities are in favour of including a plot in
preparing the Society Novel, but this cannot be recommended.
Nothing should be added to spoil in any way the perfect imbe-
cility which is the distinguishing flavour of this dish. Another of
its advantages is that it can be made by anyone in an extremely
short time.
The Detective Story.—Take one part of GABORIAU and fifty
parts of water. Add a lady of title, a comic official from Scot-
land Yard, and a diamond bracelet. Strain the mixture into
twelve equal parts and serve up monthly in a magazine.
The "Realistic" Character Study.—First boil down as many
disagreeable stories of the Divorce Court as possible. Into this
syrup pour a solution of London fog, add a few unpleasant
diseases, described with full detai). Mix with a little dipso-
mania and suicide, then slowly boil the whole. After a snort
time a thick scum will rise to the surface; this should be care-
fully separated off and published. The rest can be thrown away.
The Religious Novel.—Take a few Biblical characters, and re-
write their sayings in the language of third-rate journalism.
Season with a smattering of psychology, a quantity of irrever-
ence, and a preface declaring that every critic is either a fool or
a knave—probably both. Serve up with puff-paste. This dish
is immensely popular, and can be confidently recommended.
The Improving Book.—This dish is peculiarly well adapted for
children. To a handful of priggishness add another of imbecility.
The product should bo pently baked, and can then be »ised as
your juvenile hero. Add an unsympathetic parent, a runaway
cab, a hospital, a lingering death, and plenty of maudlin pathos.
Serve up between bright boards at Christmas.
The Superior Magazine Article.—For this purpose little more
is necessary than a wholesale ignorance of politics, together with
a large share of impudence. Sign only with a single letter of
the alphabet. Throw in many suggestions of your close famili-
arity with the POPE, the German EMPEBOR, and Lord SALIS-
BURY. Stir these ingredients well, and serve up hot as long as
editors and the public will allow you.
THE OLD LEAD OF THE COURT DANCE.
(To the Editor of Punch.)
SIR,—As the representative of the recognised organ of the pro-
fession, I beg to address you. On the 9th of July next a Sub-
scription Ball is to be held at the Middle Temple. Very properly,
tickets are only to be issued to the members of that hon. society
or their nominees, and the list of applications is to be closed
when five hundred vouchers have been distributed. Here comes
my grievance. In the circular announcing the function the
following (what I venture to call) fatal passage occurs: "In the
event of more tickets being applied for than five hundred, the
allotment will be made in order of seniority of standing of the
applicant." The italics are mine. But fancy! The ball, under
such circumstances, is sure to be crowded with elderly " silks " and
the more aged of our judges. Surely there will be something
incongruous in Mr. Justice STARELEIGH dancing "The Washing-
ton Post," while the leaders in his Lordship's Court (all of them
well over sixty) revel in the vulgar vagaries of "Kitchen Lancers " 1
And I tremble to think of the Law Officers of the Crown throw-
ing their hearts (and wigs) into " The Darn Danm." No doubt,
before the close of the evening, a "Lords Justices of Appeal
Quadrille " will be organised, with a "Lord High Chancellor Cutu-
Ion " to follow. But the climax of the sartorial exercises will be
reached when the Lord Chief Justice and the Master of the
Rolls start "The. liench Sir Roger de Coverley." But it is sad to jest
with an aching heart. If all our loaders are to oust us, what
are we to do of the junior Bar? It is bad enough to lose out
briefs, but give us, oh, give us our dances. Yours faithfully,

OUE BOOKING-OFFICE.
The Knight's Tale (BLACKWOOD), by Mrs. (or Miss?) EMILY
PHILIPS, is a masterpiece of incoherency. No doubt, when she
sat down to write, the lady had conception of a plot, ideas
of living character. My Baronite, painfully groping through
the book, discovers occasional proof or their existence. There is
a melodramatically wicked father, an incomprehensible son, a
beautiful girl who loves a man and, to begin with, leaves him.
Also, among other names occurring, are those of Mr. and Mrs.
Thornton, two exceedingly commonplace persons, to whom the
dizzied mind turns with gratitude. The scene is chiefly laid in
Paris. An attempt is made to flash upon the pages pictures of the
outbreak of the Commune. This is a partial success, since it
involves deafening noise and blinding smoke. In the environ-
ment characters grow more than ever indistinct, and the last
state of the hapless reader is worse than the first.
A Short Life of Thomas Davis, contributed to FISHER UNWIN'S
new Irish Library, proves afresh how history repeats itself.
Reading Sir CHARLES DUFFY'S accounts of O'CONNELL'B proceed-
ings during the last two years of his life, above all his references
to the Liberator's son JOHN—" this feeble, barren young man "—
my Baronite recalls Committee Room 15, and all that has since
happened among United Irishmen. It is true that Mr. PAH-
NELL'S contemporaries and colleagues stop short of accusing
their leader of treacherous collusion with the Government at a
time when he was openly professing to serve the Irish cause.
Sir CHARLES DUFFY, writing of O'CONNELL in 1844-5, has
no such scruple. For the rest, 1895 and 1845 are linked
in Irish annals by the coincidence of a state of things
where Irishmen hate each other for the love of Ireland.
Sir CHARLES, who lived and worked through the latter epoch,
gives vivid glimpses of the men and the times. His hero,
THOMAS DAVIS, brightens his pages with the lustre of a pure
patriot and a man of genius. Incidentally we get a peep at
Father MATHBW. "If you knew Mr. MATHEW " DAVIS writes to
WALTER SAVAUK LANDOR, "you would relish his simple and
downright manners. He is joyous, friendly, and quite unas-
suming." We of this generation did not know Father MATHBW.
But we have the happiness of having among us one of his blood.
If anyone desired to describe in two sentences Mr. Justice
MATIIEW, he could not improve upon DAVIS'S characterisation of
his famous kinsman. THE BARON DB B.-W.

Pleased to see the warrior, DANN, per-

Capital notion to confine the "dead-

and the veterans from Chelsea Hospital.
Improvement to have no background

canvas representing an Afghan fort not
only took up space, but looked ridiculous.
Another alteration to be commended in

back" destructive to discipline.
Much harder work than usual, and less
of the "show" element.
Suppose that "tho pageant," called on
the present occasion "Our Army, 1704—

ment.

"Pageant" pleasant, but scarcely up to

Same old " tug-of-war," same old " lemon-

No doubt the new authorities have made

WE bog to report that we have made an
examination of matters of examination,
and that the examination has been con-
ducted as an examination.
We beg to say that we have discovered
;hat the discoveries to be discovered are
still ripe for discovery.
We request to be allowed to state that

We desire to record the fact that the
ividence that has come before us has been
received as evidence of the existence of
evidence tliat might be received as evi-

missible as evidence.
We wish to announce that the witnesses
we have examined as witnesses have wit-
nessed that they are witnesses that have
been examined as witnesses.
We submit that the conclusion at which
we have arrived is a conclusion founded
upon a conclusion that comes as a conclu-
sion to the conclusion at which we have
arrived as a conclusion.
We suggest that the condition of things
into which we have examined is a condi-

tion of the things under examination in
that condition.
We advise that our advice should be ac-
cepted as advice that should not be advised
unless received as advice that yet has to
be advised as advice that can properly be
adopted as advice.
We propose that the propositions put
before us as proposals should remain pro-

when it will be necessary to propose pro-
posals that may become proposals.
We announce that we have learned that

We recommend that our recommenda-

And we beg to report that, for the pre-
sent, at any rate, we have nothing further
to report.
OH, THE JUBILEE!—As usual, the Penny
Illustrated Paper is equal to the occasion.
The history of the record reign appears in
its pages with great effect. The talented
editor depends more upon illustration than
letter-press. Well, and why not? There
is but one point to which we call atten-
tion. Surely Mr. LATEY must find, as a
bright and clever journalist, his name
rather a misnomer. Evidently his new

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTHACTBU FIUIM THI DlAKY OF ToBV, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, May 31.—
BLAMELESS HARTLEY, brought up amongst
wholesome economies of penny-bank,
shrinks with horror from demand of a
guinea for luncheon on Jubilee Day. Why,
in New York there are places where you
get a free lunch 1 "Pis true its chief con-
stituent is clam. Moreover than which,
the guest treats himself to a drink. But
the lunch is free—free as the country.
Why should the mother of free Parlia-
ments be less liberal than her lusty child'r
Surely England is rich enough to supply
to its hardworking legislators free lunch of
clam in the various delectable forms pos-
sible to clever cooks. On such occasion,
the sixtieth anniversary of a glorious reign,
a modest drink might be thrown in.
beer running from a fountain In the centre
of the hall. I don't disguise the proba-
bility that we '11 make a handsome profit
out of it."
Failing this, B. B., whose resources are
illimitable, suggests that Members should
bring down their own luncheon, and eat
it from the grand stand, coram publico. In
his mind's eye SAKK sees BLAMELESS with
a chunk of cold bacon in one fist, a knife
in the other, a loaf of bread under his arm,
and a foaming flagon between his knees,
what time HER MAJESTY rides past in
Jubilee State.
Business done.—In Committee on Em-
ployers' Liability Bill.
Tuesday.—Kitchen Committee on strike.
If ever one was justified this is. In general
way the lot of Lord STANLEY and his col-
leagues is not a happy one. They give up
much time and thought to controlling

A NAVAL FIELD BATTERY FOR THE JUBILEE!
[" I can only say that the bluejackets will be brought up from the ports, because it has b.'en
considetud that their appearance at conspicuous parts of the route would be satisfactory to the
public at lirge und agreeable to the men themselves."—Mr. Gutcken'i reply to Admiral Field.}
SARK says CHANCELLOR OP EXCHEQUER
has been approached on subject, but is
obdurate. No more grants-in-aid this
year," ST. MICHAEL says, instinctively
buttoning up his pockets. "We Ve sub-
sidised the landlords, bolstered up the
Church schools, tossed a trifle to Board
Schools, and hired the Campania to take
Members to the Naval Review. We must
draw the line somewhere, and it's ruled
firm and deep at a midday meal eaten at
the nation's expense under the storied
rafters of Westminster Hall."
The HI.AMKI.KSS BARTLEY explains that
he doesn't want anything for nothing.
What he resents is demand of a guinea for
mere luncheon. "Five bob is ample," he
says, in the excitement of the moment
dropping into the vernacular. "The
Kitchen Committee get coal, gas, china,
glass, cutlery, table-cloths, all for nothing,
rent free, and no questions asked. Place
the business on those terms in the hands
of the National Penny Bank, Limited, and
wo Ml undertake to turn you out a good
lunch at three and SUL a head, with ginger-
commissariat department of House, and
get no thanks. By way of making up that
omission they are continually grumbled at.
In connection with Jubilee they have put
on extra spurt in endeavour to make Mem-
bers and their friends comfortable on
what should be a happy day. Straight-
way immaculate Members are up in arms,
asking Why is this, and Why is that, and
Who says they sha'n't go into Westminster
Hall, ticket or no ticket?
To this, culminating to-day in more
questions addressed to FIRST COMMISSIONER
OF WORKS, Committee reply by taking off
their aprons, turning down their shirt-
sleeves, putting on caps and coats, and
leaving the premises. If Members want
luncheon they must share the BLAMELESS
HARTLEY'S cold bacon and bottled half-and-
half.
General ill-humour about what ought to
be a joyous day. MACARTNEY didn't im-
prove matters by his elaborate little joke.
Still, it was well done: much enjoyed
by Members who are not dependent on
Campania for dinner and bed on Jubilee
night. JOHN Anm wanted to know
whether arrangements have been com-

tender and intimate, the occasions for
loving communication so frequent, the
desire for rapid inter-communication so
overpowering that he really could not

as I say, the Post Office, whilst passing

DEAR MISTER,
I visit the Royal Academy one certain afternoon. There is
enormously of world. Impossible of to circulate! Impossible of
to sec the pictures! And what of persons who have not of the
all the air of to be artist painters! What of old ladys, what
of young gommeux, that which you call "smashers," what of
misses or province in costumes truly remarkable, above all what
of clergymans 1 Sapristi, que de clergyman*! Almost one would
believe himself in a missionary's meeting, or in a churches con-
gress. Sont^ils amateurs d'art, les clergymans anglais! Eh well,
I go to essay, and by degrees I slip myself at the middle cf the
crowd in the first saloon. At pain I see the pictures. Unhappily
I have not two meters of heignt, and by consequence, almost all
the time, I see nothing at cause of the hats high of form of the
smashers, or of the hats, still more high of form, of the gigantic
misses. What enormous hats! What enormous misses 1 Some
veritable amazons!
However, I succeed to see some ones of the pictures. He
seems to me that the painters who have not made some portraits
or some landscapes have produced some scene of interior.
What of pictures of the home 1 What of babys, of little childs,
of little dogs, of grandmothers, of cats, of nurses I Some ones
are charming, but at the fine that becomes fatiguing. Then
evidently, for to repose himself, one must to regard the number-
ous pictures of NAPOLEON FIRST. I see two pictures enough re-
markable and enough surrounded of spectators—the Hairnet of
Mister ABBEY, and the Boulter's Lock of Mister GREGORY. Us
ne se ressemblent pas, they resemble not themselves, they are
tragedy and comedy—a tragedy of the most sombres, a comedy
of the most gays. In effect the colours of the Lock of Boulter
are almost too much gay. While that I regard them, ebloui, a
fat lady, a little aged, says to a mister who accompanies her,
"That is a scheme of colour." Then I perceive that she has the
hairs of gold, and that she carries a robe of red adorned of blue,
and I comprehend that she has much studied the "schemes of
colour," but until here not very well!
By degrees I traverse all the halls, and I arrive to the gallery
of sculpture, almost desert, and more late the gallery of archi-
tecture, absolutely desert. I have not envy of to repose my-
self in this sad solitude. But I am suchly fatigued that I desire
to find the sideboard, le buffet. It would be very agreeable to
drink the fivocklock—a vermouth with some water of seltz, or
perhaps an english "lemonsquasch" with much of sugar—sur-
rounded of sculpture and of verdure as at Paris. Ah, the beauti-
ful occasion of to smoke a cigarette, and of to see to pass the
adorable misses 1
Eh well, I demand to an employed, at the tourniquet, where is
the sideboard, the "bar." He indicates to me the route. Of
new I traverse the crowd, and I arrive to the gallery of the
aquarelles. Unuseful then of to demand the bar, at the middle
of a such odour of the kitchen 1 C'est evidemmeni par la. Tiens,

ranean kitchen. Again I traverse the crowd and I demand the
bar. Again the employed indicates to me the gallery of the
water-coloureds. I say, "No, it is not by there, it is the
kitchen." But he responds to me that if, que si, and that I
must to descend. As that I arrive in fine to a restaurant, still
more sad than the gallery of architecture. Not of verdure, not
of sculpture, not of occasion of to smoke! I arrest myself at
the entry.
While that I hesitate, a maitre d'hotel, that which you call " top
waiter," demands me if I desire "the shilling tea." What is
this that this is that that? He responds, "You pay a shilling,
and you eat as much as you like. Allons done! To eat so

OUEEN VICTORIA
TIIK Victorian Era and the Punchian Period have
been, as was fitting, almost exactly contemporaneous.
HER MOST GRACIOUS MAJESTY had—as was also fitting,
place aux dames !—a little start. VICTORIA acceded to
her throne, upon the death of WILLIAM THE FOURTH,
on June 20, 1837, and was proclaimed on the 21st.
Punch came into AM kingdom just four years later in
1841. and was
proclaimed,

SOME JUBILEE STATISTICS.
(By a Mathematician very Much Abroad.)
IT has been estimated that the seats to view the Procession,
if placed side by side, would reach from St. Paul's to Liverpool:
but that is not all, for calculating from the returns to hand which
are based on the 1887 figures, it appears that
7,126,459 corns will be trodden on 257,166,002 times between
the hours of 9 A.M. and 3 P.M. on June 22. Their respective
owners will utter 949,422,785,124 imprecations, which, if care-
fully recorded in 623,655 phonographs, instead of being wasted
on the wrong persons, would be enough to supply the whole
population of London and their heirs at the rate of 188,472.142857
per head until the arrival of MACAULAY'S New Zealander in
3258 A.D.
"Now we sha'n't be long I" will be remarked by 6,238,651 per-
sons, 6,237,520 of whom ought to be confined in 58,109 lunatic
asylums, the remaining 1,131 having escaped for the day.
2,642 Derby dogs will get in the way or the cortege, giving vent
to 38,122 howls, and receiving 400,009 kicks.
2,489,060 views will be obscured by 248,906 matinee hats.
94,361 infants will be lost or miskid by 94,180 mothers—the
difference in these totals being accounted for by the fact that
358 will be twins and 3 triplets.
32,604 persons of the male sex will not come home that night,
having lost, so 14,392 will say, 178,299 trains; the remainder will
appear in 218 police-courts the next morning.
Of the 289,175 seat-holders 62.3 per cent, will view only the
top half of the Royal Bonnet, 17.06 per cent, will be busy with
lunch at the critical moment, 8.5 per cent, will have fainted
from fatigue or excitement, and 7.17 per cent, will not get there
at all.
A Peep into the Crystal Palace.
HANDEL is the composer in possession. The motto of the
day is "Manns conscia recti." It will be a great week for the
Palace, which will always be a genuine delight for all visiting
London on "this occasion only," and who would omit from their
agenda almost anything rather than a visit to the Crystal Palace,
especially during a "Handel Festival." The C. P., with a
HANDEL to it.s name, is an irresistible attraction. Mr. P. wishes
the C. P. a big success with the B. P.

Ah, we all have our sorrows, what.
Augustus. I vewy nearly cwicd, I assure you. And this morn-
ing I made the howwid discovewy that a wuby had dwopped out
of one of the eyes of my death's-head scarf-pin!
Bobbie. Hard luck!
Augustus. It was thuoh a weally stunning pin. I don't feel
pwoperly dwessed without it.
Bobbie. Oh, I wouldn't worry about that. No one can accuse
you of not being "dressed."
Augustus. Think not? I—aw—flattaw myself these twousnws

Bobbie.. Oh, I don't know: most of the fellows I know are
rather by way of clean-shavin'—if you know what I mean.
Augustus (shuddering). Weally? If I sacwificed my whiskaws,
I should look tho extwemely widiculous. They 're the pwide of
my existence. Without whiskaws, life would bean—aw—dweawy
blank.
Bobbie. Oh, you could keep a poodle or somethin', what?
Augustus. A westless quadwuped who would expect me to
thwow sticks into the wataw and muddy my side-spwing boots!
Haw, no thanks. I feel faint at the mere ideaw. Take my arm
and let us—aw—stwoll down Piccadilly.
Bobbie (to himself). Stroll down Piccadilly arm-in-arm with
a Johnny like an old-fashioned music-hall pro! Catch me!
(Aloud.) Er—delighted—that is, well, fact is, promised I'd
bike down to Ranelagh with some people. Time I got into

emptyheaded bounder sprung from?

THE DIVERSIONS OF JUBILEE DAY.
LONDONERS cannot be accused of taking their pleasure sadly,
or, if they do, it is their own fault, and not that of the officials,
who are so considerately providing for their entertainment.
"Vehicular traffic" is to be "diverted" in all sorts of ways:
apparently it will be in constant fits of laughter.
"Light vehicular traffic" is also to be "diverted," with pro-
bably some less boisterous form of amusement. For "Traffic
going Eastward," other " diversions" are arranged.
And, what is more, anybody employing vehicular traffic, and,
in spite of all police blandishments, obstinately refusing to
be "diverted," will find himself in Chokee, or in Queer Street,
where he will be left to himself to reflect on the inconvenient
results of any individual not falling in with the official sense of
humour.
"Diversions" everywhere, and, probably, most theatres closed.

OPENING OF PARLIAMENT.
FEBRUARY 4, 1845.
THE opening of Parliament, by our young QUEEN in person!
A theme which Punch's loyal Muse failed not to turn a verse on!
The fair young QUEEN of February, Eighteen-forty-five,
In Eighteen-ninety-seven, Heaven be thanked I is yet alive;
Though half a century hath fled, and forms have passed away
Of many great ones who beheld that Royal Opening Day,
The handsome, glad young CONSORT with plumed hat and princely
port,
The venerable Iron Duke, pride of the young QUEEN'S Court,
LYNDHTTBST, the stately Chancellor, suave GBANVILLE, stem
BUCCLEUCH,
Grave ABERDEEN, proud STANLEY, NAPIER, ELLENBOROUGH, too,
All cluster round the sweet girl QUEEN who holds in fingers taper
A memorable Royal Speech, that wondrous ''Scrap of Paper,"
Whilst down below, in a wild rush the "loyal Commons " troop,
Headed by Mr. SPEAKER. PEEL and RUSSELL lead the group.
GRAHAM and GOULBURN follow ; there is BROUGHAM'S colossal beak;
O'CoNNELL, with "Repeal," intent Ould Oireland's wrath to
wreak
Upon the haughty Saxon, whilst behind him swift " BEN DIZZY,"
Intent on "smashing everyone," is making very busy.
Then that" Cheap Bread Petition 1" Ah! what changes it portends
Of PEELTS fast coming policy doomed to sunder closest friends!
Alas! Or friends or foes these hosts are now all passed away,
The QUEEN and Punch alone survive to greet this Jubilee Day;
VICTORIA to see a sight no Sovereign yet hath seen,
And Punch to ponder memories, and to shout "God save the
QUEEN!"

"HAD A GLORIOUS DAY'S SPORT! BAG NINE AND A HALF BRACB. Doos WOIIKED
BEAUTIFULLY! I BEGIN TO LIKE MY NEW PERCUSSION GUN."
ESSENCE :OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DlARY OP TOBY, M.P.
Hoviseof Commons, Monday, June 21.—
House in Committee of Supply; benches
almost empty. CORPORAL, HANBUHY at
gangway-end, and PRINCE ARTHUR seated
nearly in the middle, are only occupants of
Treasury Bench. After a while, soothed by
monotonous voice of Chairman putting vote
after vote, PRINCE ARTHUR'S chin dropped
on his breast. He seemed to sleep—no
strange thing in circumstances. What
puzzled me as I watched him (noting, by
the way, the streaks of grey beginning to
gleam in his dark hair), was the motion of
his head and the expression on his face.
Sometimes he turned his head to the right,
bending down as if listening to one seated
an inch or two lower than himself. His
mobile face displayed the keenest interest.
Occasionally his lips moved, as if in
response to an observation. Anon, he
turned quickly to the other side, and, his
head now uplifted from its bending atti-
tude, seemed to Ijsten with the same air
•of reverent attention.
The curious scene did not last many
moments. Not the least weird part of it
was the conviction borne in upon me that
I had been watching a conversation carried
«n for at least an hour. PRINCE ARTHUR
assured me later he had certainly been
talking to Lord JOHN RUSSELL and PAM
for over an hour. Yet I am prepared to
take oath that the whole thing, which I
saw from first to last, did not occupy two
minutes.
Whilst it was fresh in his mind, PRINCE
ARTHUR told me all about it. He was
sitting, as I have said, watching the votes
piled up; last thing he remembers was
the voice of Mr. LOWTHER saying, "The
question I have to put is"
"Do you think this is the Treasury
Bench? It doesn't look like the same
shop."
This last was not LOWTHER'S voice, nor
was it a continuation of the question he
had been putting.
"Of course not," said another, sharper,
and more cheery voice. "The place we sal
in this night sixty years ago, on the eye o:
the accession of Her Gracious Majesty
Queen VICTORIA, was a temporary building
run up after the old Houses were burnec
down. It was used pending the building
of the palatial structure opened in the
Exhibition year."
"The year you were turned out, my
dear JOHNNY; when DERBY came in
! bringing DIZZY with him as Chancellor o
the Exchequer."
PRINTS ARTHUR knew who they were at
once. The little gentleman with the broad-
brimmed hat was Lord JOHN RUSSELL,
Home Secretary and Leader of the House
of Commons in Lord MELBOURNE'S Minis-
try, tho one which paid earliest homage to
Queen VICTORIA. The other (who, PRINCE
ARTHUR was surprised to see, didn't carry
a straw in his mouth) was Lord PALMBR-
STON, Foreign Secretary in the same
Government. They seated themselves one
on each side of PRINCE ARTHUR, Lord JOHN
o the right, PAM to the left.
"Didn't you feel creepy?" I asked him.
"Not a bit," he said. "Seemed most
natural thing in the world. 'Good evening,
my lords,' I said. 'Very pleased to see
ou in the old place. Glad, also, to find
.ou so friendly. Old scores forgotten up
.here—or, I mean, wherever you may
chance to foregather ?'"
"Oh! yes," said PAM; "I long ago had
it-for-tat with JOHNNY RUSSELL, and we
>ear no malice. Thought we 'd drop in on
;his interesting occasion. Hope we don't
ntrude. Were present, you know, at first
?rivy Council of the girl-QuEEN; heard
ler first speech from the throne in another
>lace; interesting to stroll round and look
n on the old shop sixty years after. Place
ooks different from this night sixty years
ago. I don't me*n chamber itself, that of
course; but in style of Members and
ashion of dress. You 've more young men
than we had. If you turn up the list of
the House of 1837, you'll see we were
mostly middle-aged gentlemen of sub-
stance.
"Yes," said JOHNNY; "and what strikes
me particularly is the way you fellows sport
:he moustache. In our time, only army
men, and not all regiments, wore the
moustache. If I remember right, some
years after the QUEEN came to the throne,
Dnly two regiments wore the moustache,
the Huzzars and the Blues."
"Quite so," said PAM. "Your memory,
always wonderful, has not shrivelled up
under normal circumstances of extreme
heat. Ahem! I mean you are still as
smart as when you fomented that row
about my saying a friendly word to the
Prince President after the coup d'ttat."
PRINCE ARTHUR thought he detected a
sneering tone in this remark. Lord JOHN
took no notice.
"lam'much obleeged to you," he said,
with courteous inclination of his head. '' I
certainly remember a scene in the House
just fifty years ago. There was there a
member of O'CONNELL'S party, one Alder-
man REYNOLDS. He represented the city
of Dublin. An Orange Member who wore
a heavy pair of moustachios, having made
a violent attack on the Repealers, Alder-
man REYNOLDS rose to reply. In course of
his speech he constantly alluded to the
Orangeman as 'the hon. and gallant Mem-
ber.' 'I am not in the army 7 interrupted
the Orangeman. 'The hon. Member says
ha is not in the army,' responded the
alderman, 'but I think if he has quitted
the trade he ought to take down the sign-
board,' and here the alderman swept from
his upper lip an imaginary moustache."
"Ha! ha!" laughed PAM, in his cheery
way. "I suppose my PRINCE knows no
personal remarks of that kind in his multi-
reformed Parliaments; no shaking o]
fists across the table, no Members sus-
pended for disorderly conduct, no free
fights on the floor of the House, eh?"
A blush mantled ARTHUR'S ingenuous
face. This must have been the momenl
when I observed him hanging his head.
"Tut, tut!" said Lord JOHN. "Human
nature 's the same at all epochs. House ol

I suppose, now, you 've lots of superior ol
gentlemen who protest that your House o

these writing, 'The new Parliament ccn
sists of more editors of papers, shop
keepers, obscure barristers, and attorney
than any former Parliament. Holland an
Portugal might disappear from the worl
without exciting the feelings or care of
single shopkeeper or attorney aniougs
us."
"I heard something at the Carlton th
other day very like that," said PRINT
ARTHUR. "Only there was nothing sai<
about Holland and Portugal. It was th
Cape and Constantinople that trouble,
the patriotic mind. Cropping up in ou
foreign politics of to-day there is abou
mention of Holland and Portugal a smel
as of faded apples."
"Precisely. You've just hit it. The

But there 's always something for what
believe you call the Jingo to get in a
fluster about. There 's nothing new under
the sun, certainly not the Jingo. PAM
was the primest Jingo of the century;

''Yes; and a nice "time I had wi<h yoi

look of melancholy momentarily clouding
the place where his brow used to be
After nil, many things are new :n this
place," he added, after an awkward pause,
lour closure, your twelve o'clock rule,
your long contributions to debate by in-
considerable Members, your tea on the
Terrace, your private rooms for Ministers,
your objection to adjourn over the Derby,
your electric lights, your signal from the
block Tower, your national expenditure of
Jver a hundred millions, and, more marvel-
ous still, your income in excess of that
fabulous sum. All these are new since the
June afternoon when JOHNNY and I sat on
the bench corresponding with Jiis in the
temporary House of Commons, knowing
that in the early morning WILLIAM THE
FOURTH had passed away, and that we
wero now the Ministers of a Queen."
"There are," PRINCE ARTHUR observed,
some other novelties in the situation as
compared with the epoch vou recall. How
would you like"
PRINCE ARTHUR turned to put a ques-
tion to Lord JOHN, and found the space he
had occupied empty. There was nothing
between him and the portly figure of
CORPORAL HANBITRY. Turning his head
quicklv, he found that PAM also had van-
ished, leaving not a straw behind. He
rubbed bis eyes. There was Mr. LOWTHER

"I WAS coming to the front in 1837,"
said JOHN BALDWIN BUCKSTONE. "I wrote

"Vou did," acquiesced BENJAMIN WEB-
TER. "I was lessee of the Haymarket in

ttle house afterwards. Don't you remem-
>er, Mr. Punch, that I offered a prize for
lie best comedy, and one of your staff
ave a series of scenes from the rejected
ompeting compositions?"
"To be sure. And the collection in-
luded TALKOURD, BULWBR LYTTON, and
^ITZBALL."
"The last was my rival with the books

sed to chaff me, Sir, but so you did

"You were rather hard upon me, Mr.
Punch," said CHARLES KBAN, "but I bear
no malice. I did my best, although I gave
you the impression that all the character!
I created suffered from a cold in the head."
"My good CHARLES, I am delighted to
see you," cried the Sage, cordially. "And
you, too, CHARLES the younger, son of the
elder MATHEWS. KBAN, you regenerated
the poetical drama, and CHABLEY, you

LEIGH MURRAY. "Do you remember The

Near lands, far lands, lands that lie between;

But now our sun descends, from the zenith westward,
Westward and downward, of all mortals seen;
Yet may the long day lengthen, though the fall be rest-ward,
May we long together cry, God save the QUEEN!

Tears will fill these eyes of mine, tears will fill those eyes of thine,
Lowly kneeling, all will pray, God save the QUEEN I

It was about the lovely close of a warm day in June,
Sweet bells, loud trumpets, all that day had played most joyous tune;
Night sank upon the dusky beach, and on the purple sea,
Such night as England ne'er had seen, nor e'er again shall see.
And now, to greet the Jubilee night of our glad sea-girt isle,
At earliest twilight beacon-piles lay waiting many a mile.
Far on the deep the sailor sees, along each shore and shire,
Cape beyond cape, in endless range, those twinkling points of fire!

"A GRANDMOTHER" ON Two GREAT DAYS.
(A long way after the late Laureate.)
SIXTY years ago, my darling, sixty years ago!
My hair was as dark as your own, little ANNIE, though new it is
white as snow.
King WILLY the Sailor-King, had died on the twentieth day of
June.
Methinks I can hear the bells a-tolling their solemn and sorrowful
tune'
And / was a girl, like the sweet young QUEEN, who on that day
came to the Crown.
"Sweet seventeen!" said your grandfather then, and my hair
was shiny and brown,
Banded in formal bands, little ANNIE, drawn over each ring-
pierced ear. •
Ah I the fashions then we thought fine, though now you might
fancy them quaint and queer.
Early Victorian style, little ANNTE, the modern critics may mock,
But! I was as proud of my big poke-bonnet and prim short-waisted
frock
As a modem girl of her tailor-made dress and her hat like a
fwden-bed.
oys who besieged my heart, little ANNIE, cared not what I
wore on my head.
Early Victorian style! Ah, well, it was stodgy, and stiff, and
strange,
And sixty years in our fashions and tastes have witnessed a won-
drous change.
The horse-hair sofa on which I sat when your grandfather came
to woo,
I remember well; and the wall-paper, too, with its pattern of
crimson and blue.
But manhood was manhood, and love was love, e'en in Eighteen-
thirty-seven,
And that stiff, quaint room in the twilight gloom was an Early
Victorian heaven
To two young hearts, on that summer eve as the summer sun
sank low,
Sixty years ago, my darling, sixty years ago!
How well I remember my first glad glance at our gentle, girlish
QUEEN
At her palace-window. She seemed half shy, half shamed that
her tears were seen,
Yet stately, too, in her girlish style, for then, as at this late day,
Queendom and womanhood mingled in her; at least, so the wise
ones say.
And so I think; though she well might shrink. Such a burden
for one so young!
But the weight of a crown hath not bowed her down. She 'd a
spirit that ever sprung
Like young wheat after the beating shower, so slight, but erect
and proud.
And now, on her Diamond Jubilee Day, I would fain make one
of the crowd.
That may not be, little ANNIB; but still, in my lonely waiting
here
To rejoin the friends of that early time, who have left me many
a year,
I can raise my prayer. And there's many an old heart, lone,
unknown, unseen,
Will join to-day in its quiet way in the cry, "God save the
QUEBN!"
Early Victorian! Ah, my child, art-critics may sneer and slate,
But the heart hath its fashions that do not change, be it early,
or be it late;
And a bosom wearing a dowdy dress with as loyal love could glow,
Sixty years ago, ANNIE, sixty years ago!
Yes, mine is a time of peace, my child; I have little left to
grieve;
And so may it be with our Gracious QUEBN! May she, too, have
Light at Eve I
And when all the jubilant shoutings of this Jubilee Day shall cease,
May the crown of all this glorious time be the boon of blessed
Peace! -—=^=

I may pocsibly find my luggage P I have two travelling trunks,
five portmanteaux, one hold-all, one bicycle, one hat-box, one
bassinette, one perambulator (as the case may be). You will do
me a thousand favours if you will kindly spare me a moment.
Very sorry, but I can't stop. We 're short-'anded this morning.
Wait a moment, I beg of you. Would you oblige me by ac-
cepting this trifling present of five (ten, fifteen) shillings?
Thanky, Sir. P'raps I can 'elp you for 'arf a minit. You

Dear me, what a crowd! Excuse me, Sir, but you are treading
on my toes! No, I do not see my baggage anywhere. How

To a Policeman, outside.—Good morning, Sir. I am anxious to
pay a visit at my friend's town-house in Soho (Leicester Square
Tottenham Court Road). Can you direct me thither?
Yes, Mounseer. Take the train back to Dover, go over to
Ostend, then you cross to Harwich, and arsk for an excursion
ticket to Birmingham, Oxford, and Paddington. That's the
only wav you can git through this crowd.
At a Cabman's Shelter.—Good afternoon. I hope I do not dis-
turb you. Sir, but I have been waiting here two (three or four)
hours. Could you tell me if there is a likelihood of your being
disengaged to-day? I trust you will not charge by the hour for
the time I have been standing here?

At a wayside Coffee-stall.—Madame, I have the distinguished
honour to present you my compliments. It is now half-past six,

in England this morning. Could you favour me with a alight

No, I am not a burglar in disguise, nor a tramp, though my hat

Monday, June 14.—Show me where, within, measurable dis-

w to be found a finer performance of WAGNER'S Tristan und
Isolde than was given at Cavent Garden on Monday night last,

Umost persuade me to be a Wagnerite. But "almost" is a very
long way off, and for my part I cannot believe that with our
tune-loving, barrel-organised public, Tristan und Isolde, Gotter-
dammerung, and '• all the Wagnerian lot of "em," will ever be
genuinely popular, as, for example, have been, the works of
MOZART, AUBHR, DONIZETTI GOUNOD, BALFE, cum aliis composi-
'.oribus. And what a trial for the mimetic powers of the actor-
singers, when they have to express their feelings in action for
the space of some fifty bars of music! Their feelings would
jrobably be very simply expressed in rather forcible language
.othe librettist or to the stage manager. Had it not been at the
)pera, where everyone, from topmost gallery to foremost orches-
,ral stall, is on his or her very best superfine behaviour, would not
a few of the immortals up above have "guy'd" the good old
amiliar situation, repeated ad nauseam, of two lovers placing their
wobbly hands over their beating hearts to express their over-
jowering passion, sighing, advancing a few paces, pausing, sigh-
ng again, giving die-away glances at each other, meant to be
jxpression of undying yearning for each other's love, but con-
veying the idea that both of them are awfully bored by having
o "fill up the time with business." And then that other part
of a long "love" scene (so totally different in every sense from
he innocent boy and girlishuess of Borneo and Juliet), where the
wo guilty lovers remain on one of "the benches in the park,"
ocked more or less in each other's arms, not singing a note for
he space of what may be ten minutes, but which to an Unwag-
nerian seems quite an hour while the lady's maid '• without"
ings, to a harp accompaniment, what to an Unwagnerian must
seem the song of the Opera—is not this most undramatic, for
drama means action, and it is only with the return of the King
Husband and his friends that there is any action at all. Then
thera is a very mild row, and a short, sharp encounter between
husband's friend and wife's lover, in which the latter comes off
second best, apparently to the annoyance of le mari tin pen
complaisant.

TAKING THE A1B.
[".If the' dty ever comes when cj cling shall have had its vogue, there is
fair possibility Ihut it may be succeeded by an epidemic of ballooning."—
The H'wld.\
Now that the season is in full swing, everybody in town _
ballooning, and an enormous number of ascents are made from
Hyde Park every morning. But it is surely necessary that the
authorities should take steps to protect those who are old
fashioned enough still to walk or drive. At present this can
only be done with the greatest peril, as the humble wayfarer ii
in continual danger of being flattened by a large bag of sane
dropped 001 his head from an altitude of a few thousand feet
Again, something should be done to prevent the repetition o
such an accident as befell Lord COLCHICKEN the other morning
As that aged nobleman was walking along Pall Mall, the grapue
from a descending balloon, whose occupants were bound for the
Reform Club, caught in his clothes, and, owing to the strengtl
of the wind, dragged him rapidly through the streets. By run
ning at top-speed, his lordship avoided falling, but it was no
until it had reached Kensington Gardens that the balloon a'
length was brought to the ground, by which tune Lord COL
CHICKEN, who a abuut seventy years of age, was extremely
exhausted.
Messrs. AERONAUT keep to the fore as the best balloon-makers
and their catalogue reminds us that their hrm numbers all the
leading members of Society among their customers. It is now
fashionable to have your car painted in brilliant colours, whilt
for those whose means forbid them to buy a balloon, Messrs
AERONAUT manufacture dainty parachutes at very moderate
prices. Certainly one's machine must be inatle of the best
quality, or a disastrous accident is sure to happen. Only th
other day Lady FLOPJUNSON punctured her silk while flying in
the park, owing to some defect in its quality. Fortunately, she
was immediately above the Serpentine at the moment, and so
escaped with nothing worse than a cold bath and a great shock
to the nerves.
\Ve are glad to hear that Sir HUBEIIT FnzTouPKiNS has beer
restored to his anxious friends, who had been much distressed by
his sudden disappearance. It seems that he had gone out witli
his balloon as usual, intending to fly down to llurliiigham. Un-
fortunately the wind suddenly changed, and blew very strongly
carrying the involuntary traveller to Iceland before he coult
effect a descent, thereby causing him very great inconvenience
No news has been heard since last week of the Countess oi
BUNKUM'S picnic party, who started in seven balloons for a trip
to Brighton. They were last sighted in the south of France, anc
it is feared that they must now be suffering from the heat, as in
all probability they have descended somewhere in Central Africa.
As usual, the doctors are endeavouring to persuade the public
that the newest pastime is unhealthy and even dangerous. Theii
diatribes, however, do not seem to receive much attention, to
judge from the number of balloons which daily darken the sky.
Of course, in order to enjoy it properly, one should never start
unless equipped with clothing for every temperature, and provi-
sions for a, couple of months. And all attempts at "breaking
records " in altitude of ascent should be left to the professionals.
But, if indulged in moderately, ballooning is a most satisfactory
pursuit, giving its followers both change of air and pleasurable
excitement, especially when one sails into a thunderstorm,, or
;he valve jams, or the gas leaks—incidents which constantly
lappen, and prevent ballooning being ever accounted an unin-
teresting form of amusement.
We are glad to see that the Church, at any rate, gives this
recreation hearty support. Indeed, on Sunday last the Bishop
of Smithfield converted his captive balloon into a pulpit, and
iddressed a large congregation from it in the opeu air. Appa-
'ently his treatment of some rather controversial points offended
one member of his congregation, who severed the rope of the
lalloon with a pocket-knife. This, unfortunately, brought the
ermon to an untimely end, as the Bishop was immediately
-arried away into space, and has not been heard of since.
Several balloon gymkhanas are shortly to be held, and will
oubtlesa prove interesting. Of course, when the season is over,
veryone will take their balloons with them into the country,

vring. What a grand affair I would have
hail! With all those ships ready to hand,
not sure I wouldn't have paid my promised
visit to Paris. Don't know much about
naval manoeuvring, but think I could
have brought up a few men-o'-war, rid
the Seine, to the Louvre.
And oh 1 what a game I would have had
at Aldershot! And out of it I Yes; all
out of itl Of course, it was felt that if I
were there, I would sure to be the central
figure. Well, that wouldn't have done.
Show belonged to much-revered relative.
But should so like to do something of the
sort myself. Could easily get a million
soldiers; and by depopulating all the
Crown colonies, would scrape up a hun-
dred German colonists. And I daresay old
KBUOEK would turn up for a considera-
tion. Then with cardboard and fireworks
could do a lot more. But then I haven't
reigned sixty years. At least, not quite.
And yet I should so like to do something
of the sort! Eureka! I have it. I know
what I will do. I will hold a Double
Diamond Jubilee on behalf of my prede-
cessor, FREDERICK THE GREAT!

THERE is no subject of the QUEEN

This is not due to disrespect,

A ROYAL (RICHMOND) GRANT.
DEAR SIR,—I understand that the
Mayor of Richmond (Surrey, not York-
shire) has been voted £250, in addition to
his .salary of £300, in consequence of the
Jubilee, by the members of the Corpora-
tion. This is an example which ought to
be followed all over the country, but half
a "monkey" is, after nil, but a poor tri-
•itp to a mayor. Let the Corporation go
the whole hog or none, at the expense of
the i-ratepayers.
Yours to command,
Sheen Green. FORK-OUT.
DURING the Eempton Park case, Sir
FRANK LOOKWOOD remarked that there
was " every chance of Scotland becoming a
Monte Carlo." The national song will be,
"Bonnie Monty Carlie!"

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
If aste and Repair have nothing to do with a repairing lea.se
in the ordinary adaptation of the term. It is the title given by
Dr. ROBSON ROOSE to a collection of hia essays, contributed at
various times to some of the principal magazines, now published
in one volume by JOHN MURRAY. It is waste and repair in the
lease of life with which the eminent Doctor (known in diplomatic
circles as RUSTEM ROUSB PACHA) is concerned. As many of our
best known public men can testify, the subject is one he is by
successful practice peculiarly qualified to deal with. The results
of his wide experience, guided by profound knowledge and singu-
lar aptitude, is distilled in this handy volume. Among the
subjects dealt with are the wear and tear of London life, the art
of prolonging life, clothing as a protection against cold, health
resorts and their uses. In the course of dealing with these and
other subjects of every-day life, Dr. ROBSON ROOSB manages to
convey in simple language a multiplicity of valuable hints, useful
alike to the invalid, and to the healthy man, whose day is not
long enough for its appointed tasks.
Messrs. BCBNAND and MAY have been making a sort
of Canterbury Pilgrimage through Kent, keeping chiefly to
the coast in the neighbourhood of Ramsgate and Mar-
gate. The result is seen in the handy volume published by
A. AND C. BLACK. The Zig-Zag Guide is totally unlike anything
previously put forward by the firm whose name is given to many
guides. Tnere is about it very little that is archaeological, his-
torical, or in other ways heavy. It is just the bright chatter of
a gay companion, who enjoys a holiday himself, and is the cause
of desire on the part of others to make holiday. In spite of its
bantering tone the book is full of shrewd hints of what to see
and how to see it, "round and about the bold and beautiful
Kentish coast." The sparkling pages are further illuminated by
abounding illustrations. Some of PHIL MAY'S very best work
will be found in this modest volume, whose price completes its
attractiveness. People about to visit Ramsgate and Margate
will find it indispensable. Those who are not going, will, when
they read it, wish they were.
"I wants to make your flesh creep," might Mr. Bin M STOKER
well say as a preface to his latest book, named Dracula, which he
las given in charge of the CONSTABLES (&• Co.) to publish. The story
ia told in diaries and journals, a rather tantalising and somewhat
wearisome form of narration, whereof \VII.KIK COLLINS was a past-
master. In almost all ghostly, as in most detective stories, one
character must never be absent from th« dramatis persmce, and
that is The Inquiring, Sceptical, Credulous Noodle. The Inquir-
ing Noodle of Fiction must be what in comedy "CHARLES his
friend " is to the principal comedian, " only more so," as represent-
ing the devoted, admiring slave of the philosophic astute hero, ever
ready to question, ever ready to dispute, ever ready to make a
mistake at the critical moment, or to go to sleep just when suc-
cess depends on his remaining awake. "Friend JOHN" is Mr.
BRAM STOKER'S Noodle-in-Chief. There are also some secondary
Noodles; Noodles of no importance. This weird tale is about
Vampires, not a single, quiet, creeping Vampire, but a whole
brood of them, governed by a Vampire Monarch, who is ap-
parently a sort of first cousin to Mephittvpheles. Rats, bats, wolves
and vermin obey him, but bis power, like that of a certain well-
advertised soap, "which will nut wash clothes," has its limits;
and so at last he is trapped, and this particular brood of vampires
is destroyed as utterly as would be a hornets' nest when soused
with hot pitch. It is a pity that Mr. BRAM STOKER was not con-
tent to employ such supernatural anti-vampire receipts as his
wildest imagination might have invented without rashly ven-
turing on a domain where angels fear to tread. But for this,
the Baron could have unreservedly recommended so ingenious a
romance to all who enjoy the very weirdest of weird tales.
THE BABON DE B.-W.
A NOTE OF THE DAY.
(Intercepted.)
MY DBAS FRIEND,—According to my promise I write you a
line to give you all the news of the moment. Of course you
know we have had the celebration of the Diamond Jubilee. But
let that pass.
The progress of the peace negotiations at Athens are of con-
siderable interest. And when I talk of Greece I am reminded
that illumination by electric light is much cleaner than oil.
On Jubilee night this was evident. But let that pass.
The House of Commons has got into Supply. And when I talk
of Supply it is a matter of conjecture whether the wood employed
in the seats can be used again. Of course the Jubilee was
unique.
The cricket averages so far have not been sensational. We
have the Philadelphians, but the Australians are non. est. And
this reminds me that the Colonial Premiers have had a good time
of it, thanks to the Jubilee. But let that pass.
The theatres are doing well. You know that Mr. BEERBOHM
TREE has opened Her Majesty's. The Poet Laureate wrote the
inaugural verses, and that reminds me that the poem on the
Jubilee was up-to-date. But let that pass.
I really can scarcely describe the fashions. Red, white and
blue are the prevailing colours—no doubt in honour of the
Jubilee. But let that pass.
The season is on the wane. U lieu w«> reach July we begin to
look out trains. And this season has been particularly brilliant
on account of the Jubilee. But let that pass.
And now, my dear friend, I think I have exhausted my budget
of news. Of course I could tell you all about the Jubilee, but
as you have seen what I could say in the newspapers, my account
would be a trifle stale. And this is rather unfortunate. If I
omit the Jubilee I can think of nothing else.
Yours very truly, TAIT MONTAY.

"GENTS' old materials carefully made
up" and turned out as good as new, or even
better, by Mr. SYDNEY GRUNDY, who has
shown workmanlike skill in this the latest,
but probably not by any means the last,
adaptation of ALEXANDRE DUMAS' comedy,
Un Mariage soiw Louis Qwinze. When
in 1861 PLANCHE did it for Mr. and Mrs.
CHARLES MATHEWS, as My Lord and My
Lady: or, it Might have been Worse, The
General, so capitally played now by Mr.
SYDNEY VALENTINE (who, by the way,
makes him so rough and uncouth as to be
more suggestive of Orson than Valentine),
was transformed into a lady, and played by
Mrs. WILKINS, and Mrs. FITZWILLIAM
played the soubrette, which is now viva-
ciously interpreted by Miss ADRIBNNE
DAIROLLES. The old-fashioned confidential
valet, Jasmin, is effectively played by Mr.
HOI.MAN CLARK, "by permission of Mr.
TREE." By the way, three out of the four
principal characters, exclusive of Manager
MAUDE and wife, appear here by kind per-
mission of somebody else. Mr. TEHHISS is
"permitted" by Messrs. A. and 8. GATTI,
and Mr. VALENTINE is " permitted" by Sir
HENRY IRVING. The formula used to be,
"by kind permission," but on a change
tout cela, and into what isevidentlv purely
"a matter of business," kindness does not
entpr.
Miss WINIFRED EMERY, as Comtesse de
Candale, has not had a better part, nor
played a part better than this, for some
time. True, it makes no such extra-
ordinary demand on the dramatio resources
as does the very compound character of
the Chevalier de Valclos on those of Mr.
CYRIL MAUDE, whose impersonation of a
frivolous coxcomb, with all the courage oi
his opinions and absolutely spoiling for a
duel, is masterly. Had Maitre DUMAS not
fashioned this character on these lines, the
denouement as it is would have been im-
possible, and the comedy would have be-
come a tragedy.
Mr. WILLIAM TERRISS is so delightful as
the Count of Many Costumes, that the
audience would not spare a single riband,
or buckle, or scrap of lace, from his adorn-
ments; and as to the way in which he
holds a letter in his left and slaps it with
his right hand, as a preliminary action to
reading its contents, why, there is not a
genuine gallery-goer, or persistent pittite,
but must feel tempted to murmur sob-
bingly, "Sure-ly that letter comes from
See-usan! Bless her dear eyes!" and then
anxiously expect him to address the Cheva-
lier as messmate," previous to proposing
a hornpipe a deux. Yes; Number Al
Adelphi Tumi IMS is. every inch a sailor.
But, pardon, here he is quite the young
debonnair French count, with all the aire
and graces associated with the court of
Loms QUINZE.
Congratulations to Messrs. HARRISON,
MAUDE and GRUNDY on their successful
levival or a play which has already had a
good time of it during its long career in
a former state of existence, isy tne way,
in Ittol, Mr. DION BOUCICAULT, wuo had a
knack of taking over whatever suited his
purpose, used one scene of this play in his
Love in a, Maze, without any acknowledg-
ment. But PLANCHB found him out, and

lished play, My Lord and My Lady.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARF.
RED TAPE AND BROTHERLY LOVE.
DEAR MB. PUNCH,—Some of the members of the Colonial
Forces, now visiting the homeland of their QUEEN, are reported
to be rather sore because official Bed Tape—that dreadful ham-
string of the old bureaucracy—has in minor measure not done
justice to their patriotism in crossing the seas for the Diamond
Commemoration of our well-beloved Sovereign. You, Sir, repre-
senting, as you do, an Imperial Concert, know well that neither
the QUEEN nor the People of the United Kingdom desire that
any slight should be passed upon these gallant warriors, who,
like the followers of LARS PORTITTS of Clusium, have come from
East and West and North and South. Rather would we all wish
that they should be, as they deserve to be, the Heroes of this
Jubilee Year. I am convinced that wheresoever they come from,
the Sons of the Empire are welcomed by their British brethren
with fervour and delight, but it is just as well for them to under-
stand that the Permanent Clerk in a Government Office is gene-
rally so tied and bound with the Red Tape aforesaid, that a
statue of him would resemble the Laocoon without any of its
artistic qualities. He is not a man, but a machine, and in the
latter capacity he has never got beyond the possibility of being
worked otherwise than by hand. He was brought up by hand,
and he lives by hand—often to mouth. He has no ideas beyond
Tradition, and he resents interference with those ideas.
I am not sure whether the American plan of shaking nil the
Civil Servants out of their places on the change of President
would not be beneficial here, when a Ministry goes into Opposi-
tion. But in any case I am sure that Mr. JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN,
our greatest Imperialist, would like, as I would, to cut up all
red tape and join it with white and blue for decorative purposes.
Let all our Colonial visitors believe in the sincere love of their
Mother Country for them and their prosperity, as does the great
Dominion of Canada. Yours obediently,
BRITANNICUS.

INTERVIEWS WITH INANIMATE
OBJECTS.
A PENNY ICE.
I HAD heard a great deal of the perni-
cious character of the common or "bar-
row" ice, so felt considerably embarrassed
on recently finding myself face to face
with one. Its evident coldness did not
tend to put me at my ease, and I made a
lame commencement of my cross-exami-
nation.
"Do you suffer at all, this weather, from
over-heating?"
"Who are you a-gittin' at?" was the
suspicious reply. "It ain't no odds to me
whether you heats me or not. I s'pose I
was made to be heaten. If you mean,
does them suffer as does the over-heating,
I dunnp but what as 'ow there might be
somethink in it."
"You have misunderstood me, but I am
not sorry, because you have incidentally
touched upon the very thing about which
I should like definite, first-hand informa-
tion."
"Fire away, guv'norl"
"Are you, strictly speaking, wholesome?
I have read unpleasant medical opinions
to the effect that you are ruining the in-
teriors of countless little East-end arabs.
Doctors say that you are positively thick
with microbes."
"Mike who? I'm positive I ain't
thick with any cove of that name. Never
'eard tell of 'im."
"It's like this. An analyser who"
"'Old 'ard, guv'norl If you mean Anna
*Liza of our Court, I don't see that you 've
any call to bring 'er or any other lydy
into this 'ere bizness."
I saw that I must make a simpler appeal.
The want of culture shown by this un-
educated ice struck me as a forcible con-
trast to the refinement of the barrel-organ
that I had previously interviewed in the
mtfrests of Mr. Punch's readers.
They say that you are not clean, and
that you make the children ill."
"Tommy-rot, guv'norl Dirt's all right
if you don't git too much of it. Some* of
the poor little beggars do git too much ot
it, there's no denying that, but not from
me. There 's lots o' folks who 'd be all the
better of a penny hice. Keep 'em cool,
like! 'Alf them there editors of noos-
papers, and sich, should be made to eat a
hice reg'lar. They're sich blessed fire-
eaters that it would do 'em a power o*
good. Then I'd feed the 'Ouse o' Com-
mons on hices. That would settle their
HASHMEAD-BARTLETTS a bit. and save 'em
from gittin' into 'ot water."
"Thank you for tlis suggestion. I will
write to Mr. Punch about it—but I cannot
believe that you are wholesome."
"Just one thing more, guVnor. As a
loyal subjec', I has my views about
honourin' the QUEEN'S Diamond Jubilee.
Let that £26,000 cheque be spent in pro-
vidin' all the school-children of England
with penny hices on Jubilee day. Let 'em
hall stand up at noon punctual, sing ' Gfod
save the Queen' and then eat the hices.
They will never forget it as long as they
live!"

Ycftd (in pursuit of escapfd Bull, to Timmins, who is "teadiing himself"). "Hi, MISTER!
IK YBR CATCH HOLD OF HIS LEADING-STICK, HE CAN'T HURT YER!"
DARBY JONES ON ASCOT.
HONOURED SIR, •— Crippled by over-
indulgence after the success in the Derby
of Galtee More, who represents, I under-
stand, a kind of Alps in Ireland, I never-
theless have crawled from my gout-laden
couch to put my hand to paper other
than that delicate "flimsy" manufactures
by Messrs. PORTAL in Hampshire for the
use of the Bank of England and tie bene-
fit of Mankind. There are those who pre-
tend that a ten-pound note is difficult of
ciiculation. So is the blood. Neverthe-
less, I knew a Man who used to patronise
the defunct Chain Pier at Brighton, and
boast that he obtained admission gratis by
exhibiting the Order to Bearer for ten
doubloons issued by the Old Lady of
Threadneedle Street, the gatekeeper being
unprovided with the requisite change.
This dodge succeeded for a. time, but it so
happened that at Brighton Races, the
crafty individual in question produced his
lucky tenner to back a quadruped for a
sovereign, and was promptly made a vic-
tim of the Confidence Trick, one of the
simplest and most effective games evei
contrived bv the Israelites during their
sojourn in the Land of the Nile.
But Ascot, noble Sir, is my theme. 1
can imagine you arrayed in a suit of pearl
grey, surmounted by a white "chimney-
pot," and not unadorned with a Jubilee
buttonhole—red, white and blue—strolling
in the Royal Enclosure amid the Great
Personages of the Diamond Commemora-
tion, conscious that socially you were a
sort of MOHNINGTON CANNON, and capable
of rivalling that famous jockey, as at
Hurst Park, in landing winners. Ascot,
however, is not what it was when it was
chiefly patronised by those recorded in the
immortal chronicles of BURKE, AVALFORD,
and DEBRETT. The excellent service of the
London and South-Western Railway Com-
pany, coupled with Sir CHARLES SCOTTEH,
has much to answer for. I can remember
a period when the temporary tenant of a
mfnsion in the neighbourhood, provided
with all the luxuries of Messrs. FORTNUM
AND MASON, was unable to supply bread to
his guests owing to the failure of a local
roll-maker. How different is the case
nowadays! One runs down to the classic
Heath from Waterloo with all the ease of
the Lord Mayor proceeding from the Man-
sion House to inaugurate a Hospital in tho
rcpion of Whitechapel.
Last year. Mr. HAMAR BASS appro-
priated the Ascot Cup with Lore Wisely,
and the Hunt Cup was annexed b>
Quarrel—both the owners being of high
degree. Take my word for it, honoured
Sir, that at Ascot, the noble and wealthy
horse-owner is always to the fore—like a
sailor on the look-out.
Truth must be told at all hazards, and I
regret to say that, owing to the uncertain
state of the Law on the subject of what I
may term "Place-betting," I was unable
to be present. But>—the tip I sent you,

in twenty-four hours! Hat's sheer
fudgery!
We want, as the Times very properly puts
it, a few days more "respite from
drudgery."
It would be mean to our glorious QUEEN to
cut down her holiday stingily.
All very well for those blamed Little Eng-
landers, who would do everything
dingily.
All boys are Tories and patriots, you bet,
hating everything funky and shabby;
And making our Jubilee Holiday less than
a week would be worthy of LABBY.
He. would cut down Royal Grants, Fleets
and Pensions, and everything noble
and jolly,
And no doubt he 'd like to cut down the
QUEEN'S gift, which is all nasty Radi-
cal folly.
Mako it a week and you '11 make us all
patriots! Pater and mater, I reckon,
Will squirm at the notion; but in their de-
votion, wherever VICTORIA may beckon
They'll loyally follow! 'Twill beat LUB-
BOCK hollow, VICTORIA'S week for the

And just won't we enjoy it, and better em-
ploy it than all the Bank Holiday
trippers will!!
A CASE OF IDENTITY.
DR. GRIMSHAW, Head Master of St.
Boniface, is taking the Sixth Form, when
there enters _a telegraph-boy. The Doctor,
thinking to impress the class, motions the
intruder to be quiescent till one of the
form has finished his construing. When
the boy has finished, he beckons to the
postal emissary, and in his rich, sonorous
and academical voice, enquires: "Well,
my lad, what do you want?" Telegraph
Tiny. "'Ere's a wire for GRIMSHAW."
The Doctor. "Give it to me." Telegraph
Boy (resolved to have his revenge). "But
are you GRIMSHAW?"

THE JUBILEE CELEBRATOR'S VADE MECUM.
Question. Is not the celebration of the Jubilee nearly over?
Answer. Certainly not, for although the great event has passed,
minor exhibitions of enthusiasm will continue for a fortnight or
longer.
Q. What has been the characteristic of the demonstration P
A. After mature deliberation I would suggest miscalculation.
Q. Upon what evidence do you rest your proposition?
A. The evidence of my senses. For instance, it was thought
that the procession would be the indirect cause of many acci-
dents—as a matter of fact it was accountable for none.
Q. Can you give other instances?
A. I can. It was believed that the streets would have been
crowded to excess, and every precaution was taken to prevent
mischief. According to statistics, the spectators in the streets on
the line of route were comparatively few, and scarcely up to the
average of the customary multitude watching a Lord Mayor's
Show. Then it was believed by a number of speculators that
the sale of seats beside the progress would produce fortunes,
whereas moat of the transactions connected with such like ven-
tures resulted in loss.
Q. Was it not thought that the raising of fares would be a
good thing for the proprietors of omnibuses and cabs P
A. It was. And here again may be traced evidence of a mis-
calculation.
Q. What are the physical requirements of an official Jubilee
celebrator?
A. He or she should be able to dispense with horses and car-
riages, trusting to his legs alone, to keep a clear head in the
vastest crowds, and to do without nourishment for an indefinite
length of time.
Q. Ought a celebrator to be able to spend money?
A. He ought to be able to spend money freely, by paying
about four times the normal value of everything, from pen-
wipers to bedrooms in a hotel.
Q. What would be the Jubilee price of a penny bun P
A. About threepence, and a halfpenny glass of milk would
often be valued at twopence.
Q. From this I take it that enhanced prices have to be paid
for everything in London during the celebration?
A. Certainly. Perhaps the prices would have been lower had
the anticipations of the visitors been more moderate.
Q. You mean to say that the newcomers, expecting to have
to pay, found their hosts ready to accept the suggestion?
A. Quite so; and where a stand was made for a reduction, a
compromise immediately followed.
Q. Can you give an instance of this?
A. Certainly, in the sale of seats, where a place originally
valued at five guineas ultimately fell to five shillings.
Q. But leaving pecuniary considerations out of the question, is
the Jubilee a success?
A. A gigantic success, for it has shown that a quarter of the
world loves and appreciates a blameless Queen, and rejoices to
be her subjects.
Q. And such a demonstration no doubt will be an excellent
object lesson to envious foreigners?
A. Unquestionably.
Q. Then, when all is said and done, the game has been worth
the candle r
A. Undoubtedly.
THE KEMPTON PARK APPEAL.—What is "a place "? Give an
"i" to it and it will certainly be a "plaice" not "within the
meaning of the Act." But then comes the question, "What
Act?" It must be a Fishery Act, at least, so it would appear to
a fisher for plaice, but not to a place-hunter. A place is some-
where where a horse can stand, vide the poet:
"Thi« is the Place; stand still, my steed!"
There are all sorts of "places," and sooner or later the Book-
maker may find himself in "a tight place." The vagaries of this
argument are endless.

"How did I become possessed of this
desirable residence?" I said to my little
grandson, who, having had an altercation
with his nurse, had prematurely joined our
circle. "I'11 toll you."
I looked round and admired our domicile.
It was a fine place, but having of course
been left severely alone, was falling into
decay. That is the worst of our society.
We can stand in the moonlight, or float
about woods, but we cannot keep mansions
in thoroughly decorative repair. More's
the pity, but then, the existence of a shade
has compensating advantages. The power
of becoming visible or invisible at will
opens out a large field for the perpetration
of practical jokes.
Not that I am fond of humour—as a
matter of fact, I jest with difficulty—but
still, I can see the benefit of the privilege
of spectre ways.
"Yes; I got it from Messrs. POSTER AND
HAMMER, the, eminent estate agents and
auctioneers. It came about in this way.
I and my friends who occupied the very
best parts of town—Belgravia (North and
South), Mayfair, and Upham Park Road—
had seen with no little regret that our pre-
sence was driving away possible tenants.
For you must know, boy, that at heart we

"The very best of fellows!" exclaimed
the phantom lad, enthusiastically.
"It may be so," I admitted, compla-
cently. "Well, there was the cavalier
who stabbed his lady in white satin, and
the Scotch dame who came out of her
picture, and the chap who woke them up
with raps."
"Slightly vulgar, the chap with the
raps." said the juvenile apparition.
"Granted," I again acquiesced. "And
it was the chap with the raps who
caused us to relent. I went to see the
house agents, and found them very decent
neople. They were a little frightened at
first, but I put them at their ease by some
pleasant chaff."
"And everything was settled satis-
fartorilv?"
"Quite. We gave up the other houses
on condition of taking this. And our resi-
dence here hurts no one, because the estate
is in Chancery."
"I see. And what has become of the
chap with the raps?"
"Well, I scarcely know; but from what

Splendid! How it would have rejoiced the heart of our only Sir
DRURIOLANVS COVENTGAHDENSIS, could he have been present to
see how thoroughly those educated up to this sort of business
under his management had learnt their lesson and even improved
on his teaching. It was the crowning triumph by Night of the
Two Days Jubilee. Everybody was there to be seen by Every-
body Else, and woe be to Anybody's friend who shall say to Any-
body, "Why, I didn't see you there!" Not to have been at the

gentle winkiness of the cooing turtle-dove. If a Royalty felt
faint, Her Royal Highness had but to call "Steward!" and at

HONOURS DIVIDED.
(A Tlunu/ht on Jubilee Day.)
THE Force of the Empire was mustered to-day;
But amidst gorgeous soldiers and glorious horses,
We must not forget, Punch will venture to say.
The plainest, but not the least proud, of our Forces.
"Force is no remedy?" That's as may be.
But "the force," for prevention, of risk to our city,
In all this huge jostling of great Jubilee,
Did a wonderful work to forget which were pity.
The soldiers and sailors went striding along;
To be drawn to injustice by glitter were snobby.
So let 's make division of praise from the throne
Between General "Bobs," and the general ''Bobby."
MY AUNTS AND THE JUBILEE.
June 1.—Most unfortunate. Last winter promised my mater-
nal aunt JANE to escort her to see the Jubilee Procession. Good
old lady, good old house in Devonshire, good old port in cellars,
good old sum in nice, safe Consols, and so on. Could I refuse?
But shortly after, my paternal aunt ELEANOR also desired me to
escort her to the Procession. Rather sour old lady, gloomy old
house in Bath, only teetotal drinks in cellar, but many thousands
in Home Rails. Weakly agreed.
June 2.—Must secure three seats. Aunt JANE, stout, always
warm, has written that she must sit in the shade. Aunt
ELEANOR, thin, always cold, says in this weather she prefers the
sun. Can I put one on north side of Strand, one on south
side, and myself on church in the middle? Hardly. Neither
would sit alone.
June 5.—After seeing innumerable plans and innumerable
seats, have at last secured three on a stand, so placed, that
Aunt ELEANOB at the end will get the sunshine on her rheumatic
right shoulder till one o'clock, Aunt JANE being entirely in the
shade. That's settled.
Jiune 8.—Letter from Aunt ELEANOR. Will on no account
venture to sit in any wooden erection likely to catch fire. Letter
from Aunt JANE. Cannot occupy seat on any temporary struc-
ture which might possibly collapse. Start again. Dispose of
three seats at considerable loss. After great search discover
small corner room in solid, fire-proof building, with large
northern window taken out, and small eastern window to admit
sunshine. Aunt JANE will no doubt require this window opened,
causing a draught highly detrimental to Aunt ELEANOR'S rheuma-
tism, neuralgia, and chronic catarrh, and Aunt ELEANOR will
demand that it be shut, with the blind up, a state of things
likely to produce apoplexy, or sunstroke, or cerebral congestion
in Aunt JANE; but I can do no more.
June 10.—Aunt ELEANOR writes that she cannot bear the
noise, draughts and excitement of a London hotel, and will there-
fore stay at Richmond. Aunt JANE writes that she wishes to be
at the coolest part of Norwood. Secure rooms for them.
June 11.—Letter from Aunt JANE. She quotes leader in
Times of yesterday, warning seat-holders of every possible
danger. Was afraid she would see it. It refers to excitement,
early rising, anxious and fatiguing journey, imperfect provision
of food, possibility of fainting, delay in getting away, instability
of stands, danger of fire, risks of smoking, removal of shavings
under seats, and need of restoratives. She wants to know what
time she will have to start. Try to reckon it out with help of
Times article. If seat-holders driving a distance usually covered
in twenty minutes must start at 5.30, at what time must anyone
start from Norwood to drive to the Strand? Evidently not later
than midnight. Good heavens I A iid here's a letter from Aunt
ELEANOR,. She writes that she has just seen an article in the
Times. Of course she has. And she wants to know when she will
have to start. By Jove, yes! Richmond. That's soon calcu-
lated. About 8 P.M. Say immediately after dinner. Answer
both letters as cheerfully as I can.
June 19.—Have made all necessary arrangements at last. Aunt
JANE supposes that it may be possible to leave safely about six
hours after the procession has passed. Aunt ELEANOR would
prefer to dine in our hired room, as she evidently cannot reach
Richmond till breakfast time the next day.
June 21.—Have stored in room large quantities of tinned
meats, biscuits, wine, lemonade, mineral waters, <fcc. Also re-
storatives of various kinds.
June 22.—The great day. Up at 4.30. Start at 5.30, with
uncheon and dinner packed in> hampers. Expect to reach
Strand at eight. Arrive there at 6.10. Something wrong in

HEREDITY.

:ession! Can't get back. Remain behind crowd. See nothing,
rremendous final cheer. Then people slowly disperse, and at
iwelve o'clock walking in streets is quite easy, and I stroll sadly
lome. No news of aunts.
June 23.—Letter from Aunt JANE: Left Norwood at midnight.
Arrived in Strand at 1.15 A.M. House shut up. Nowhere to go.
At last drove back to Norwood, much annoved at bad arrange-
ments. Letter from Aunt ELEANOR: Left Richmond at 8 P.M.
on Monday. Arrived in Strand at 9.30 P.M. Room locked up;
could not remain in carriage all night; nowhere to go. At last
drove back to Richmond. Had not expected that any nephew
of hers would annoy her with vulgar practical jokes, and need
not express her opinion of such conduct.
MR. DOUGLASS, the Atltenceum informs us, "finds from his
observations" that "Jupiter's fourth satellite, as well as his
liird, rotates on its own axis in about the same time as it occu-
pies in revolving round the planet." What capital exercise, or
ixisi/.e I Except perhaps a nde on the switchback, there can be
othmg to equal the delights enjoyed by the third and fourth
ate I lite. It is sad to think that those two satellites, attached
such an old monarchy as that of Jupiter, should be such
borough revolutionists.

Waterloo at the Lyceum on June 26.]
WELL changed, Sir HBNBY !" Comrades"
was the word.
"Ladies and gentlemen" seemed too
punctilious.
Few things more striking have been seen or
heard
In all this jocund time of joy Jubilious,
Than Corporal Brewster, drawn by CONAN
DOYLE.
And played by HENRY IRVING to "Our
Boys"
From over-sea. What charm it lends to toil
When K-III'/I an audience admires, enjoys i
A Story of Waterloo, told to a crowd
Of such Colonial "Comrades," was a
thing
To hear, see, and remember. Did one proud
To mark those stalwart fellows rise and
sing
God save the Queen together! CHAMBER-
LAIN
Doubtless enjoyed his portion of the
cheering,
As did the moving actor. Scarce again
To such a "house" will either be ap-
pearing.
A grand occasion, met in style deserving
Of Art, such "Comrades," and Sir HENRY
IRVING!

Voiced by
["The QUBEN'B Message to the Empire reached
Australia, India, and the furthermost parts of the
globe before the l(i I.KN had emerged from Buck-

FROM heart to heart! O'er land and sea
That message flies, like Peace's dove!
Where'er your world-spread people he,
Knit to large unity by Love,
Swifter than SHAKSPEARE'S sprite could run,
They answer promptly, and as One I
Like Ariel, "ere your pulse twice beat,"
Love " drinks the air," and so returns
To lay our message at your feet.
From heart to heart the message burns,
As warmly 'midst the northern snows
As where the tropic sun-blaze glows.
From every race, and from all ranks,
Round the great globe where floats your
flag,
Responsive to your royal thanks,
From hearts and lips that will not lag,
Fly thanks as loyal. Thanks, great QUEEN,
For all you are, and long have been!
Thanks for Imperial service high,
And thanks for simple hearth-side grace,
For patriot aeal, for purity;
Womanly sweetness in high place,
And the strong heart that ne'er did fall,
Though duty danger-clad might call.
Thanks from our hearts, beloved QUEEN,
God's blessings crown your future days!
Still may you be, as you have been.
The theme of world-wide love and praise.
A proud, free people bow the knee
To womanly worth and genuine royalty I

PETITE, perhaps, but charming—quite—
And beautifully dressed,
One always meets you with delight
At parties round the West.
The cynosure of neighbouring eyes,
The hostess's trump card.
You hold the undisputed prize
Of man's sincere regarof.
Your aspect is serene and cool,
Though crowds have round you crushed—
If one may state a general rule,
One will not see you flushed.
And if, as I 'vo heard people say,
Too oft they find you cold,
The warmth which you sometimes display
Affords them joy twofold.
What praise, wherever you are found,
Night after night you win I
And oh! when supper-time comes round,
How sweet to take you in I
You need no bard your praise to pen,
Your fame will never fail;
Tis yours to "fly through the mouths of

Because you are—a quail!

DUE BOOKING-OFFICE.
NOVEL readers, aweary of the clacking in the kail-yard, will
turn aside from The Lady Grange (SMITH, ELDER) if they know
the scene is laid among Scotch folk. Wherein, my Baronite tells
me, they will make a grave mistake. The story dates back to
1753, when Scotland was seething in rebellion. Mr. ALEX-
ANDER INNEH SHAND manages, by what seems exceedingly simple
art, to reproduce the very men, even the atmosphere of the
times. His study of that hoary but fascinating villain, SIMON
Lord LOVAT, is an admirable portraiture. So are the drawings of
Lord GRANGE and his shrewish wife, whose punishment is the
thread on which the story hangs. Incidentally there are some
powerful word-pictures of the uttermost Highlands and the least-
frequented islands of Scotland. Altogether a picturesque book,
of keen human interest.
My Baronite is not familiar with the name of MAY SINCLAIR,
and is not sure whether Audrey Craven (BLAOKWOOD) is a first
essay in novel writing.' It has about it some marks of the inex-
perienced hand. But it is full of promise, and displays even
exuberant power.
The Story of a "Billiard-Ball (SAXON & Co.) is one with a pur-
pose. Mr. MOUNTENEY Jp.PH.sox, STANLEY'S compunion-iu-arin.s
in the search for EUIN PACHA, desires to bring home to the
public mind the horrors and iniquities of the slave-raiding which
goes on in Africa to this day in connection with the hunting up
of ivory. It is a pitiful tale, recalling some passages in I Inch
Tom's Cabin. Mr. JEPHSON knows what he is writing about,
and, scarcely less essential, knows how to write. The story is
told with a simplicity that adds much to its force and effect. THE BARON BE B.-W.
"A SIMPLE INQUIRBB" writes: —" Among recent advertise-
ments and notices of 'Jubilee Music' I see advertised 'The
Proper Psalms.' Are there any Improper Psalms f I hope not;
but if there are, I trust they will never be made public, but rele-
gated strictly to the Secret Service Department.
ONE OF THE "LAST KNIGHTS."
"SQUIRE BANCROFT BANCROFT," that's our old friend's name;
Now as " Sir SQUIRE BANCROFT" is known to fame.
Rarely ere this has such a thing been done,
A Squire and a Knight rolled into one 11
Even amid General Rejoicing.
Mr. Timnius (at the bar of the "Pig and Parsley," to Mr.
SIMNIUS). Well t here's health and happiness I
Mr. Simnius (who has lived for a fortnight on multitudinous
whiskies and scanty biscuits). Health I never had, and happiness
has long departed, but still I '11 drink with you, TIMNIUS.
IN the Cornhill there is a paper by Mr. HARTLEY WITHERS,
entitled, "How to Scan a Prospectus." Very good; but if it is
not a poetic Prospectus or a Prospectus in verse, how can it be
'' scanned" P Perhaps our Withers will be unwrnng by this
critical query.
On the Course.
Angelina. What do they mean, dear, by the Outside Ring?
Edwin. Oh I that's the place whero we always back outsiders.
A splendid institution 1
[So it too* titt EDWIN fell among gentlemen from Wales.
ANGLO-TEUTONIC JOKE (from the Irrepressible, released during
the rejoicings). Count SECOND-OFF looked so magnificent in the
Jubilee procession that most spectators backed him for Font
place.
WHAT BOMB OF THE NATIONALISTS WOULD HAVE us TO BELIEVE.—
That Ireland is a County-Down trodden country.

PUNCH'S ALMANACK FOR 3397.
AUNT TABITHA ON OLD PARLIAMENTARY
WAYS AND NEW.
LETTER I.—Congratulations.
MY DEAB CHARLES EDWARD,—I received
your telegraphic despatch informing me
of your success at the poll. I confess I
could have lived through the added hours
if you had been content to use the letter-
post as the medium of conveying the in-
telligence. There is an abruptness about
telegraph message*—not to mention their
charge of two shillings for delivery at the
Grange—that is annoying.
I never have used this new-fangled thing
myself, and never shall, any more than I
use envelopes. In your dear grandfather's
time we wrote on a sheet of letter-paper,
and when we had covered three sides we
folded it over and used the fourth for the
address. What was good for your grand-
father is good enough for me, and I wish
it were so for even younger people.
But I suppose I must congratulate you
on becoming one of the Members for the
borough of Greatmart. It is, I under-
stand, still reckoned to be an honour to
belong to the House of Commons, though
from all I hear it is a very different place
in all ways from that in which your grand-
father sat for twenty-eight years. It is
a remarkable coincidence, conveying a
lesson which, to my mind, has not been
sufficiently inculcated, that when in the
autumn of 1832 the first so-called Re-
formed Parliament met, your grand-
father and the constituency he repre-
sented for more than a quarter of a cen-
tury were both effaced. Two years later,
the old House of Commons, in which Pitt
and Fox and your grandfather had sat,
was destroyed by fire!
Now I understand you have got what
is called a Palace, containing a thousand
rooms, a hundred staircases, and two miles
of corridors. All I can say, my dear
nephew, is, don't lose your way or your
head in them. Yours affectionately,
TABITHA PLINLIMMON PENLKY.
The Orange, Easthope, Sent.
A DAY IN THE LIFE OF AN
UP-TO-DATE DOG.
DREADFUL dream this morning! Thought
I was sitting at a cold, draughty street
corner, with nothing on but a leather col-
lar, and a tin mug in my mouth, collect-
ing coppers for a common, vulgar blind
person. ZIost degrading! Intensely re-
lieved, on waking, to find myself in my
own comfortable padded basket. Had
kicked the quilt off, and somehow managed
to wriggle out of my nightgown. Talk-
ing of my nightgowns, whoever embroi-
dered my monogram on them might have
done it in two colours instead of only one.
So much more chic.
After breakfast, to Toilet Club with
Robert. Curling-tongs not warm enough.

England are said to have lost their heads.
Not at all. They both had their wits

LETTER II. —A Little Cheque.
DEAR CHARLES EDWARD,—I intended in
my last letter to send the enclosed little
cheque, as I daresay the expenses of the
election have drawn upon your purse.
This will serve as a sort of postscript to
my former letter, and perhaps you won't
object to its wording.
I hope its receipt will not involve you in
any awkwardness about bribery and cor-
ruption. But we never know where we
are in these days. We have been reformed
who was present, by command, at the
wedding of Queen Anne. I like it because
it's the only business-place in London a
woman can enter without running the
risk of being served by a man wearing
whiskers, mustachios, or both. Even the
I policeman at the door is closely shaven.
That reminds me of the House of Com-
mons when your grandfather sat in it.
Not that I ever looked on the scene my-
self, counting considerably fewer years
than some persons are good enough to
assign to your aunt. But your grand-
mother has told me about it. Indeed, I

out of all comfort and consolation. It was
different in your dear grandfather's time.
There were seventeen electors forming the
constituency «f Old Sam in. Your grand-
father reckoned they cost him at every
election, in round figures, a hundred
guineas apiece. But that was the begin-
ning and end of it. You paid your
money and you took your seat. Now, I
believe, you really are not allowed to
spend more than a fixed sum on a Parlia- <

There's a pretty pass to which free- j

You will observe that my cheque is

banked there, and so did his grandfather,
see row upon row of country gentlemen,

coats, short waistcoats, coats cut away a
little above their hips, and their continua-
tions the reverse of baggy. All well-bred
gentlemen, you can see. Not a lawyer,
an Irish Member, or a whisker among them.

of Mr. Chamberlain, Mr. Hanbury, and
Mr. James Lowther. the old fashion has

SO FAB, NO FARTHER.
EXTRAOBDINAKY POSITION ASSUMED BY MR. SNOODLE ON THE SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED
REFUSAL OP HIS HOKSE.
THE PENDULUM OF TASTE.
(Extract from a Loiulon. Daily Paper, 1996.)
AN event which has been anticipated
with considerable interest by connoisseurs
took place on Friday and Saturday last,
when the celebrated collection of Early
Victorian decorative furniture and objects
of art belonging to the late Mr. Eylie
Culchard was disposed of by public auction
in the historic rooms of Messrs. Hammer
and Rostrum.
The bidding was spirited throughout the
proceedings, and some of the more im-
portant and interesting lota obtained
sensational prices.
Amongst them the following may be
singled out for special mention.
A group of fruit, realistically modelled
and coloured by hand, in wax, and in
perfect preservation, under cylindrical
glass shade of period, was knocked down
to Mr. Kernooze, of Old Bond Street, for
two hundred guineas; a similar group, in
which an orange, or peach, was slightly
damaged, going for one hundred and fifty
pounds only.
A gaselier, in simili-bronze, warranted a
genuine antique, fetched sixty guineas, its
richly moulded design and decorative effect I
causing many present to wonder why our
latter-day craftsmen do not show a greater
tendency to return to the elegant floridity
of middle-nineteenth-century work.
A set of six coloured lithographs, chiefly
scriptural, and supposed to be of German
origin, were secured by Sir Thomas Tee-
bord, the recently-elected President of the
Royal Academy, for the very moderate
sum of twenty guineas apiece. We under-
stand that Sir Thomas intends to present
these prints, which are probably unique,
to the Tate Collection.
A tea-cosy (the padded and quilted head-
dress worn by well-to-do matrons when
engaged in drinking the then national
beverage) fetched £26 10s. This article
is beautifully embroidered with holly-
berries in the delicate "crewel-work"
which is now, unhappily, a lost art.
An ornamental pendant, composed of
coloured glass beads, and said (though per-
haps erroneously) to have been intended
for the convenience and occupation of
flies, was bought for seventeen guineas
(Mr. Kernooze).
Another curio, which was the subject
of brisk competition, was a convex orna-
ment in solid glass, enclosing an enamelled
view of the old pier at Worthing. This
article, the only known fellow to which .
contains a representation of the beach at
Tenby, and is now in the South Kensington ^
Museum, was eventually secured, amidst
breathless excitement, by Mr. Finucane,
for the sum of two hundred and eighty
guineas.
A kneeling statuette, in alabaster, be-
lieved to represent the infant Samuel, fell
to Lord Boomptrek of Koffyfontein, for
two thousand pounds. On the last occa-
sion on which it was put up for sale, it
realised no more than five hundred and
seventy guineas—a remarkable proof of
the revival of public interest in Early Vic-
torian sculpture, which has long suffered
from an unaccountable want of apprecia-
tion.
A magnificent suite of genuine maho-
gany chairs and sofa, upholstered in real
horsehair—which, owing to the total ex-
tinction of these interesting animals, is
now an unprocurable commodity — was
bought by Mr. Gibber-Wright for fifteen
hundred guineas; not an excessive price
when we consider the modern rage for
examples of perhaps the chastest and most
classic period of British domestic furni-
ture.
A very beautiful Kidderminster carpet,
with a striking design of Large nosegays
on a ground of green moss, which, as Mr.
Rostrum observed, no one but the crassest
Vandal would dream of placing anywhere
but upon the wall of his reception-room,
fetched a thousand pounds, and a har-
monium (a kind of musical instrument),
in walnut wood, with the pedals - covered
with genuine old Brussels carpet, went
for three hundred only.
One lot consisted of a complete set o
antique "antimacassars," in wool and
crochet, curious and interesting relics,
as Mr. Rostrum remarked, of the days
when it was by no means uncommon tor
members of the male sex to be provided
with a natural head-covering.
Much arousenwmt was afforded when
an authentic specimen of a Victorian tall,
or chimney-pot hat" was put up for sale.
Ifcis stated to have been the property ot a
well-known contemporary demagogue, and
to have been habitually worn by him in
Hyde Park, though we must confess it
seems well-nigh incredible that even the
most desperate seeker after motonety
could have descended to such a means of
drawing attention to himself.

THERE WAS A NEW WOMAN.
(Neo-Nursery Rhyme.)
THERE was a New Woman, as I Ve heard
tell,
And she rode a bike with a horrible bell,
She rode a bike in a masculine way,
And she had a spill on the Queen's high-
way.
While she lay stunned, up came Doctor
Stout,
And he cast a petticoat her "knickers"
about,
To hide the striped horrors which bagged
at the knees.
When the New Woman woke, she felt
strange and ill at ease;
She began to wonder those skirts for to
spy,
And cried. "Oh, goodness gracious! I'm
sure this isn't 11
But if it is I, as I hope it be,
I know a little vulgar boy, and he knows
me j
And if it is I, he will jeer and rail,
But if it isn't I, why, to notice me he 'II

So off scorched the New Woman, all in
the dark,
But as the little vulgar boy her knickers
failed to mark,
He was quite polite, and she began to cry,
"Oh! Jimmy doesn't cheek me, so I 'm
sure this isn't I!"

AUNT TABITHA ON OLD PARLIAMENTARY
WAYS AND NEW.
LETTER 111.—On the Terraee.
CHARLES EDWARD,—I declare, if it were
not too late, as it probably is, I would stop
payment of the cheque I weakly sent in
my last letter. What do you mean by
promising to take me to tea on the Terrace
as soon as it is warm enough to sit out?
If I were within arm's reach of you, I
would make it warm enough for you, quite
apart from conditions of ordinary tem-
perature. What have I done or said that
you should imagine I would show myself
in-sueh a place, amid such surroundings?
This invasion of the House of Commons
by women, these frivolous five-o'clock teas,
out a candle, and fell on -the clerk's wig
at the end of the table. Your dear grand-
father, not knowing whose was the mis-
hap, was so sardonically severe on the
subject when he came home to dinner,
(Members dined comfortably at home in
those days,) that your grandmother
thought she had better not mention
names. As far as your grandfather was
concerned, she carried her secret to the
grave, but never saw her fan again, which
she always believes the clerk at the table
gave to his wife—or someone else's.
Thus you will perceive how, even in
errrly stages of the now riotous fashion,
the attendance of women at the House
of Commons debates led to duplicity in
the most sacred relations of the house-
"Diddy-iddy-duckums "—but that was en-
tirely beside the point, and she need not

Ida Downey, who was not at home.
Robert was told to leave one of my
visiting-cards on her Japanese spaniel,
Mousme, a conceited, pampered little
black and white beast, whom I have rather
gone out of my way to snub. Much an-
noyed, because this sort of thing puts a
poodle in such a thoroughly false position;
but of course my Old Woman doesn't con-

mark the decadence of what your dear i
grandfather used to call the mother of;
Parliaments. Long before imperial legis-
lation was degraded into the position of
an accessory to a social function, my blood
bailed at the complaints of women who go
to the House of Commons to hear debates,
and abuse the gallery for being "a cage.1'
Why, in your dear grandfather's time there
was no accommodation for women in any
part of the House of Commons, it being
in those times thought they were much
better at home minding the business of
the household. If curiosity was insistent,
and their husbands temporarily weak, they
were conducted to the ventilating cham-
ber over the candelabra in the roof, where
three or four of them might, with ex-
cessive discomfort peep down on the
scene.
Your dear grandmother never went but
once, and then she was so perturbed that
she dropped her fan, which, falling through
the aperture, narrowly escaped putting
hold. So let me hear no more about
the Terrace, if you would have me remain

A DAY IN THE LIFE OF AN

IN the evening, as it seems to-day
is ipy birthday, I entertain a few intimate
friends at tea. Not a very successful
party, somehow. Frisetteput her foot into
my saucer, and wolfed up all the apricot
sandwiches — which got on my nerves.
Goggles and I had a little difference about
the last macaroon. As his host, I suppose
it would have been in better taste not to
make my teeth meet in the curl of his
tail; but no one knows how provoking a
pug can be. till he "s tried!
One stuck-up little terrier tried to show
off by sitting up and nursing a rag doll
between his forepaws, which was really
more than I could stand!
The party broke up rather prematurely,
in a general row, after which I discovered
that my black satin dress-coat with the
rose-coloured lining was torn all down the
back. I shall never be able to wear it
again!
To bed, heavy and depressed, feeling
tired of life, and much troubled at night
by biliousness, which is all the Old Lady's
fault for not keeping a French cook. The
sort of slops Mrs. Harricoe sends up are
enough to ruin any dog's constitution I

A loud "bike" bell to please mine ear;
A chance to maim, if not to kill,

If luck or skill that prey shall snatch
From my wild wheel, the shock will test.

And Lucy, on her wheel shall "scorch,"

On rubber tyre—by Jove, 'tis heaven!

AUNT TABITHA ON OLD PARLIAMENTARY
WAYS AND NEW.
LETTEU IV.—On Choosing a Leader.
DEAR CHARLES EDWARD,—I suppose one
of your earliest duties when you have
taken your seat in the House of Commons
will be to select a leader. I do not pro-
fess to be well up in information about
the present degenerate House of Commons.
From what I gather, I fancy you will not
be embarrassed by lack of the commodity.
Of course, a Penley will be guided by Prin-
ciple, and you can serve only under a Tory.
I am told, that now my old friend Ca-
vendish-Beiitinck (not little Ben, but
Big Ben) is dead, and Herbert Knatch-
buil - Hugessen (whom I knew in Eton
jacket) has retired from the Parliamentary
scene in disgust, there is only one Tory
in the House. That is Mr. James Low-
ther, known to his friends as "Jemmy."
Circumstances never favoured him with
the opportunity of being presented to me,
but, oddly enough, I have a copy of his
portrait. It is a result of the process we
used to call daguerreotype. The thing is
now, I believe, known as a "photograph."
Walking one day in Canterbury, I hap-
pened to see it in a shop window. I confess
that at first I thought it was some dignitary
of the Church, a canon, perchance a dean.
There was about the countenance that re-
poseful, dignified, yet chastened expres-
sion we instinctively connect with the
Church. It was only when I proposed to
purchase the unpretentious work of art.
that I was told that it was a portrait or
the Right Hon. James Lowther, Member
for one of the divisions of the county.
That, by the way. I merely mention it
as showing how a certain personality
struck me when, in ignorance of identity,
I looked upon his portrait for the first
time. From all I hear it was not a bad
guess of mine. Circumstances have acci-
dentally directed Mr. Lowtker's steps into
other paths. But he would have been
more at home in a quiet deanery than
amid the turmoil of political life.
In this connection there is another
Member I should like you to know,
though, of course, on quite other terms.
It is Sir William Harcourt. His politics
are atrocious, but his grandfather was an
archbishop. He, too, one can imagine,
might have risen to high estate had he
followed in the ste^s of his father,
sometime Canon of York. I admit it is
probable, that had Sir William been a
bishop, there would have been exceptional
mortality amongst the curates of his dio-
cese. But curates are constitutionally
timorous.
However, that again is nothing to do
with your associating yourself with a
statesman of first rank in your Parliamen-
tary relations. Mr. Lowther would be a
safe guide, and is, I am given to under-
stand, not undesirous of forming a party.
During the last session his followers num-
bered only one. I forget whether it was
Sir Albert Rollit or Sir Elias Bashmead-
Artlett. Your anxious aunt,

MT DEAR CHARLES EDWARD,—I confess
spent a wretched night thinking of the
jmptation that will soon surround my
dear brother's only child. Isn't there a
man in the House of Commons called John
Burns? He may have been christened
John, but I think that I have heard that
he was nicknamed Burns, because, when
apprenticed to a palliasse manufacturer,
he set fire to the straw and burnt the
house down. I may be wrong. But that
is my impression. I am sure there was
something about a palliasse; or was it a
door-knocker? Anyhow, he's a dema-
gogue, and I would not trust a demagogue
with a box of matches, even if, in accord-
ance with maudlin modern fashion, they
strike only on the box.
I do not, for a moment, fancy you will
be brought into personal contact with this
person, or any like him. Thank Heaven
you will always vote in the other lobby.
Even that, when I come to think of it, is
not certain. Statesmen, as your dear
grandfather used to say, must work with
any tools that come to hand. I can con-
ceive circumstances or tactics in which so
astute a Parliamentary Hand as Mr.
James Lowther might have to form tem-
porary alliances with all kinds of sections.
For your own part, dear Charles, let them
be strictly temporary, and go straight
home as soon as the House is up, or even
before.
In your dear grandfather's time, except
when they were passing the Catholic Be-
lief Bill, or wrangling over the Reform
Bill, Members, as I have said, dined de-
cently at home. Now, I believe, they
never adjourn till midnight, and some-
times sit up all night. In case of late
sittings—at least, to begin with—I wish
Mr. Lowther would see you home, tin-
der such guidance I should feel no anxiety
for my dear nephew.
Now you are in the House you must
make a mark in it. Begin by scorning to
bo satisfied with anything below the rank
of Prime Minister, and you may rise to
the status of Civil Lord of the Admiralty.
Above all things, don't be
An haberdasher of small wares
In politicks and State affairs.
I'll wager you don't know where that
couplet comes from? No. The present
generation does not read Hudibras.
You'll find the lines there, and also this
description of a bore of the Rump Parlia-
ment whom Charles the Second, of blessed
memory, kicked out of Westminster:
Still his tongue ran on, the leas
Of weight it bore, with greater ease,
And with its everlasting clack
Set all men's cars upon the rack.
With volleys of eternal babble
And clamour more unanswerable.
It appears that, with the possible ex-
ceptions of the Parliaments in which your
dear grandfather sat, the House of Com-
mons has been pretty much the same from
the Commonwealth to the present day.
I hope my only nephew will do something
to raise its status, bringing it nearer to
its glorious position before it was tainted
with the brush of Free Trade, Reform,
Disestablishment, and the other plagues
that have fallen upon the country—I won't
say because of, or as a punishment for,
but certainly subsequent to, the efface-
ment of your dear grandfather from the
Parliamentary arena, and the destruction
of a faithful constituency that was ready
to share his last guinea.
Your affectionate aunt,
TABITHA PLINLIMMON PENLEY.
The Grange, Easthope, Kent.
P.S.—I hear the very best things of
Toby, M.P., who sits for Barks, a most

do worse than cultivate his acquaintance.
